    "content": "22 Films Felix \u2022 29 November 1999\nAli G, inn\nscreen \u2022\nFarscape TV Series Ali G,inn it On Video\nWhilst many of TV's most famous Sci-Fi series may\nhave emanated in the sixties and seventies, the\nnineties has undoubtedly seen the genre's heyday.\nA succession of high-budget, high-concept, productions have generated massive profits for their\nproducers, and have opened up science fiction to\na much wider audience. Surely the prospect of\nmainstream TV's latest offering, the Jim Henson\nWorkshop produced Farscape, is consequently\none to relish? Sadly, the answer is a definitive \"no\".\nFarscape embodies much of what is bad about science fiction (especially on TV) - it's characters are\nmore like caricatures, it's plot is generic and obvious, and the entire affair is far more concerned\nwith appearances than content.\nFirstly, to the concept. With a backstory that blatantly apes the seminal Suck Rogers, Commander\nJohn Crichton (Ben Browder), whilst out on a routine test flight, is suddenly sucked into a wormhole\nand thrown across the galaxy to a new space and\ntime. His out-of-control shuttle accidentally\ndestroys an alien \"peace keeper\" ship, and he is\nimmediately thrown aboard a strange craft, full of\nescaping prisoners. On board he joins the prisoners in their flight from the evil Peacekeepers (ie\nGalactic Empire / Dominion), and slowly he wins\ntheir respect and friendship. (Yawn).\nBasically, Farscape consists of excerpts of every\nother Sci-Fi series you've ever seen, patched\ntogether and thrown into one ungodly whole,\nreplete with comedic fish-like aliens, furry Yodaesque figures and the obligatory love interest (who\ngoes by the inspired name of Officer Aeryn Sun).\nChrichton's quest to earn the aliens confidence\nnaturally results in his humanity and conscience\nwearing off on all those around him (surprise),\nwhilst the constant threat of attack leaves the door\nopen for a stream of bad CGI effects.\nIt's only with programmes of this calibre that you\nrealise quite how good The Next Generation was..\n\u2022 Dave\nAli G,( real name, Sacha Baron-Cohen), the interviewer of the famous on The 1 IO 'clock Show, has\nrecently found cult status in student circles. How do\nI know this? Simple, you hear people using his\ncatchphrases. Often I find myself listening to people ordering po nani, not panini, from the BMS\ncafe. Often I find myself asking myself what flavour\npon an iI want to mange on that dinner time. Tuna\npanini would definitely raise a snigger.\nThe humour derives from the ridiculousness of the\nwhole persona. He is kit ted out in expensive\nsportswear with the big medallion using words like\n'bitches' to describe his girlfriends and using 'me'\ninstead of 1'. Ali G tries to act and talk like he is\nsomeone from one of the darkest ghettos in\nPhiladelphia, but his hometown is the suburban\ntown of Staines in Berkshire. He talks of gang warfare between the Berkshire West-side massive and\nthe East-side massive - it's just plain stupid but still\nhilarious.\nThis video has all the best bits of his interviews from\nthe first series of The 1 1 O 'clock Show. These are\nhit and miss, the funniest being interviews with the\nchief of the British Board of Film Classification and\nthe ex-education minister Sir Rhodes Boyson (\"Why\ndon't they teach proper maths in school, why teach\nin kilos and grams when you should deal in\nounces, quarters and eighths?\").\nThe best bits in this video are where he goes out\nand about. His excursions to Wales and Northern\nIreland are superb, while his trip to see the tree\nprotesters is a gem. The music during the cut\nscenes is absolutely brilliant. Not only does this\nvideo poke fun at the entire gangsta culture, but it\nprods its music as well.\nTo buy this video, you need to be a big fan. He is\nan acquired taste, but exposure to his brand of\nhumour (if you are not easily offended) could turn\nyou into an Ali G convert. Nuff said. Innit.\nH HI Hn Captain Nemo\nAli G Competition\nThis week Channel 4 have kindly donated\nan Ali G,inn it video for one lucky reader.\nSo, how much do you know about the\ncomedian who plays Ali G? Well, you'll\nneed to do some research and find out\nabout the man himself to answer this week's competition question.\nWhere did Sacha Baron-Cohen (Ali G) go\nto university and what did he study?\nE mail film.felix@ic.ac.uk before 12pm on\nWednesday 1 December with the correct\nanswer and maybe you could be the proud\nowner of an Ali G,inn it video.\nWinners of last week's competition have all\nbeen notified by e mail so go and see if\nyou're a winner.

    "content": "10 Feedback Felix \u2022 29 November 1999\n* in t Ever been to Male t Street? There's not much there except for the Virgin\nMegastore and a drab old pub called\nthe \" Duck and Dive\". It has recently\nhad a makeover, but like most recent\nmakeover s in London it has been a conquest of style over substance.\nThe Duck and Dive is in an unfortunate position. Over the years, it has\nhad many managers (on average\none per year), wh o have struggled to\nmaintain the clientele. While the\nlocals seem quite happy togo there\noccasionally, it seems that everybody\nelse can't be bothered to spend half\nan hour and two pints-worth of cash\ngetting there.\nLuckily, this pub has some very\nunderstanding shareholders, who seem quite willing to throw stupendous amounts of coloured notes\nthrough the door in order to repair\nsome quite nasty holes in the paper-work. Sadly, the holes never go away.\nSo why should you care? After\nall, you lot never go there (and I can't say I blame you), so it makes no d if ference, right? Wrong. One of the\n\"shareholders\" mentioned above is\nyou, in a roundabout way. UL U is\nfunded by the colleges of the University of London, through money given\nto them by the Higher Education\nFunding Council, ring-fenced for \"student services\". This means that if\nthey didn't spend it on UL U, they\nwould have to spend it on you.\nAnd how much is involved? The fairly major sum of \u00a390,000 each\nand every year - more than enough to\nsave a library or two.\nThis isn't heresy, if you stop and think about it. How many of us actually go and use the facilities that we pay for so handsomely? The numbers are pretty small. Some people\ngo there for the clubs and societies,\nbut the number of clubs that UL U provides that ICU doesn't can be counted on the fingers of one hand. I'm sure some people will write in saying\nthat they go for the social life and that\nthey love it, but I'd bet that the majority of you would much rather see an extra \u00a390,000 each year pumped into improving our own facilities.\nOne argument that has been\nused in the past is that UL U sporting\nclubs provide a standard of competition that our own clubs can't match. I have no issue with this - it's completely true. However, better funding,\nbetter organisation, and better facilities for our own sporting clubs will\nsoon render this distinction invisible.\nRoll on the advent of the IC Athletics\nUnion, and soon we'll have no reason to be in UL U at all.\nIf the student body agree to that,\nthe Rector can finally engage the final\nphase of his master plan, and the\nCollege can secede from the University altogether. None of us will ever\nagain have to bear the shame of having the same degree certificate as\nlesser beings from UCL and Q MW... FANTASTIC\nKensington and Chelsea have a new member of Parliament, elected at last Thursday's by-election.\nMany people have used the media attention generated by an election to their advantage; at the last\ngeneral election a local businessman, \" Mr Mongo lian Barbecue\", stood for \"The Mongolian Barbecue, A Great Place To\" party. A couple of weeks\nago an IC student was considering standing for the\nparliamentary seat. The student was in negotiations\nwith an internet company who had offered to pay\nhim to change his name to Mr www.fun mail. co.uk,\nand to stand against Mr Portillo. With the large student population in the constituency, there would have been an excellent chance of the candidate not\nlosing his deposit, had the company not pulled out\nat the last minute. The student; who else but every-body's favourite president, Dave Hellard?\nSINGING FROM THE STAIRS\nHave you ever wondered why the staircase in the\nfoyer of the BMS building is so big, and in such an obstructive position? Although this question is yet to\nbe answered, a use has been found for the impressive structure. A choir, \" Can to Villanella\", made up of both medics and scientists from IC, are going to\nbe singing from the stairs at 1 3 . 0 0 this Tuesday\nlunchtime. They will be enhancing the building's environment, serenading people eating at the BMS cafe. The content of the gig has been described to\nKevin as: \" Going from serious to silly\".\nIN SEARCH OF THE LIGHT\nGhosts, UFOs, and the paranormal. There is no forum for discussion of such matters within Imperial College. Kevin would like to know why. Kevin\nknows he wasn't the only person wh o was comprehensively spooked by the fake documentary:\" Ghost Watch\" presented by Mike Smith and Sarah\nGreen, when it was shown on TV about eight years\nago. Kevin believes that people who have experienced the paranormal are privileged to have done\nso, and ought to share their experience with others.\nKevin urges anyone interested to contact him on kevin@ic.ac.uk.\nMish\nMash\nA Mostly Harmless Column by\nKevin, a random entity who\nknows nothing about nothing\nCULTURE CLASH\nMedical students living in halls such as Wilson\nHouse have \"voiced some disquiet about being\nmixed with other students.\" The reason given was\nthat they felt that their course: \" was one that\nrequired great demands from them and this could\nbe made easier if they were together.\" Kevin is\namazed at the implied insinuation that non-medical\nstudents are a rowdy bunch whose presence is not\nconducive to work. Thankfully, it was final year students who had made these comments. Although a quick comparison between Prince Albert and Guildsheet will confirm that there is still a world of\ndifference between the medic and non-medic cul-ture s, the new medics certainly see themselves as IC\nstudents, and do not hold the anti-IC prejudices of\nthe older students. Kevin is confident that IC will\nbecome\" one big happy family\", even if it does\ntake some time.\nMICROSOFT MAYHEM\nPlease would someone from the CCS take a few\nseconds to configure the Outlook web access\ndevice correctly. The problem lies with the 'Sent\nMail Folder', which has been bizarrely set up so that\nit does not tell the user who the recipient of the messages was. Instead it displays the name of the person who sent the messages. While this may be useful to entities like Kevin, who possess a plethora of\nidentities, it is just an annoyance to the majority of\nusers. Kevin would not be at all surprised if the fault\nhe has spotted is in fact a feature of the Microsoft\nsystem, which will not be fixed until the next extortionate ly expensive upgrade.\nSHAKEN NOT STIRRED\nRecently in one of IC's high tech lecture theatres,\nthe lecturer attempted to adjust the lights. After\nspending a few seconds pressing buttons on the TV\nstyle remote control, it appeared that the lights were\nnot going to respond. The lecturer decided to continue. Shortly after restarting the lights dimmed, the\nfront of the room was strongly illuminated, and the\nelectronically operated curtains started to close.\nThe lecturer, was stunned, remarking \" When that\nsort of thing happens I always expect ad is embo died voice to boom out: ' Good evening Mr Bond.' \"\nTo comment or contribute:\nhttp://come.1o/ mishmash\nor email kevin@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

Anothei wee!, another blis luna DAVID ROBERTS\nMichael Portillo, former Defence\nSecretary and, in all probability\nWestminster's newest MP came to\nCollege on Friday 1 9 November to\ngive a talk to ICU's Conservative\nSociety.\nHe spoke to a reasonable crowd\ngathered in the Union Concert Hall\n(who had all been subjected to a security check before being allowed\nto take their seats) on the subject of\nEuropean integration and monetary\nunion, in a fashion that suggested\nthat he may have moderated since\nhis most outspoken days in the Cabinet. Although he still lectures vociferously against any further integration or union, he now adopts a more\nconciliatory stance, accepting that\nIn Brief\nWYE MERGER Imperial is to merge with Wye College in early August next year. The\nproject has had direct contribution\nfrom Imperial's Rector, and will\njoin two leading centres of excel-len ce. President Natasha Newton met\nwith Wye College Union to discuss\nthe merger from a student per-spec ti ve. It emerged that the major effects will be felt at Wye. The College will have a larger percentage of girls and a significant number of Wye's students will take their\ncourses at South Kensington. Ms. Newton is presently gea ring up to revise the Union constitution to allow for the new College to have a seat on Council. The plan is to introduce them as a Club and Society Committee in an arrangement similar to that of Silw ood Park.\nWye is a renowned agricultural college. In 1 9 0 0 it became part\nof the University of London, although located in the Kent countryside, some60 miles away. The College's surroundings are very -different to that of the centrally\nlocated Imperial, and therefore\nshould bring a wider range of\nscope to the type of study that\nImperial can currently offer.\nstrong business links with the Continent are vital to the survival of British\ncompanies. Indeed, his entire\nspeech was argued from an economic and monetarist point of view,\nignoring the vehement (and occasionally racist) rhetoric that peppered his every appearance five\nyears ago most notably, he now adopts his Spanish roots (his father\nwas a Spanish fisherman) as a major\nplus point, rather than a polo gi sing for them as he once did. Sadly, as Felix went to press, the\nresult of Thursday's by-election was still unknown. However, with the seat\nalready one of the safest Ton/ constituencies in the country, it is almost\ncertain that Mr Portillo will have\nbeen elected as the new member of\nparliament for Kensington& SOCIAL SELECTION\nFigures recently released by the\nHigher Education Statistics Agency have revealed that a graduates chances of employment are largely\naffected by their A Levels, age, gender, social class, backgrounds and subjects studied. On average4.4% of graduates from UK universities were unemployed. With Oxford and Oxford Brookes registering graduate unemployment rates below2%, the\ncity of Oxford came top in the\nemployment stakes for graduate employment. The significance of\nthe University sector was surprisingly low for instance four former polytechnics scored lower unemployment figures than Cambridge. The subject studied at University was highlighted as a determining factor by the study; those taking\ntechnical and science subjects were\nidentified as being particularly attractive in the job market.\nMEEK MALAYS STUDENT\nThe recent exploits of Malaysia' s prime minister Dr Maha thir Mohamad have certainly not endeared him to his electorate.\nMany were appa led by his jailing of\nPhoto:Archive\nChelsea( an area which includes\nNHLI, Charing Cross and Evelyn\nGardens, but not the main campus)\nby the time you read this. Full results\nwill appear next week.\nAnwar Ibrahim.\nWith today's general election\nseeing him trying to cling onto\npower, the students have been conspicuous in their absence. In contrast to their Indonesian counter-parts, who formed themselves into\na youth organisation that became a figurehead for change, the Malaysian students have recognised the threat posed by Dr Maha tir who has slowly moulded a policed state out of the democracy that was formed on its independence from Britain.\nThe student's fear stems from\nthe Universities and Colleges Act, which bans the country's130,000 students from becoming involved in\npolitics. Those who breach the Act face expulsion, a criminal record\nand probably a life of un employ ment. The consequences clearly\nwork - only 2 0 students have been\nexpelled from University in the past\nfive years.\nLT CARDS\nDistributing London Transport cards\nthrough the Union has proved to be a great success.

    "content": "29 November 1999 \u2022 Felix Music 17\nfrequency y/^ Bryan Adams\nThe Best of Me\n(Mercury)\nMetallica\nS&M( Universal)\nWell, he's been around for a while now, but when the voice of the relatively senior soft rocker Bryan Adams rings out, fanatics will scream\nmaniac ally, whilst the rest wonder why it's such a big deal. It's true - to\nsome he's a legend, but his world-wide acclaim doesn't reach every-one, and delving into the contents of some of his past albums it's not\ndifficult to see why. However, credit to Adams and his production team\nfor this, his eleventh album, a dual systematic promoting the release of\nhis forthcoming single, title track The Best Of Me, yet also functioning\nas a Greatest Hits album.\nOne wonders whether he's running out of new material - media hype\nsuggests the end of a glorified and successful musical career is nigh,\nbut then maybe a Best Of... album is Adams' best way of linking recent\nsuccesses such as Ooud Number Nine and the duet with Mel C When\nYou're Gone with legendary hits Everything I Do (I Do It For You), Summer of '69, and Run To You. Also included is the theme song to the\n1 996 film Don Juan de Marco, Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman?\nand the 1 993 joint effort All For Love, performed with Sting and Rod\nStewart, alongside a medley of highlights from past albums. The only\nnew tune on the album is The Best Of Me, which despite being pretty\ngood, falls just short of the expected mark - however it's likely to do well\nand fly high in the charts as a result of the massive fanbase Adams' has\nbuilt up over the years (Summer Of '69 was a1984 classic).\nThe album really is a collection of Bryan Adams through the years and\nyou've more than likely heard it all before, but here it's quite conveniently all in one place for you, and if you just want to skim the surface\nof Adams' music and take out all the best bits, then this album's definitely for you. Of course, it's all a matter of taste and Adams is liable\nto become a victim of the fashion to loathe the extreme popularity of\nsuccessful music, but give it a chance and it's not a bad album. There's no denying he's done some good stuff in the past and this is a more\nthan adequate presentation of it. Has definite Christmas present potential. I really, really wanted to slag this one off. I mean, really, this isn't on. If the world's biggest rock band playing live with a hundred and odd piece orchestra isn'ta blatant\ngimmick to encourage fans to buy two CD's worth of old material, I don't know what\nis. This is Metallica, too, who hardly need the money, and have worked their way up\nfrom nothing without massive hype and exposure. I wasn't intending to give this an\neasy ride. But...\nThe problem is that this is really rather good. The concept works, to a point. A classical orchestra makes a remarkably good accompaniment to Metallica's songs. The set\nleans heavily in favour of material from their last two albums and their-more relaxed,\norganic sound is easily complemented by the orchestra. The effect varies from fairly\nstraightforward backing noise on Bleeding Me to more complex and interesting count-er-melodies on The Outlaw Torn. There are a couple of new songs, which are pleasant enough, but don't really leap out and grab you. More interesting, though, are\nolder, thr ashier songs like Master of Puppets or Battery. These are metal classics, and\nsome people would regard this treatment as sacrilege. It sounds a bit strange, at first,\nbut the different elements merge surprisingly well, particularly when there's more than\njust the original tune going on.\nThe overall sound, surprisingly, isn't quite up to Metallica's usual high standards.\nFrankly, the drums are too loud. Sorry Lars, but there you go. The guitars occasionally seem muted, too. It's worth it all just to hear James Hetfield singing the old songs,\nthough - his voice has come on in leaps and bounds since the days of debut album\nKill 'Em All, and he manages to wring even more emotion out of Nothing Else Matters\nthan he did nearly ten years ago.\nSo, on reflection, have they pulled it off? Not quite. This is a good album, which stands\non its own merits as being well worth a closer look. As far as I'm aware' there's nothing else like it available. It's not the Metallica we grew up with, and there will undoubtedly be a lot of fans who'll loathe this, but then the band have grown up too. They've\nalways done what they liked, and not done badly out of it, and I'm sure that this'll be\nno exception. The overall vibe is very different from their studio output, but there's still\nthe power and emotion that you'd hope for. Not perfect, a bit too long, and in places\na bit pointless, but interesting - and better value than most live albums.\nPete Gareth\nCompetition - Bryan Adams, Counting Crows & Metallica Giveaway\nThis week we've got all kinds of goodies to give away.

    "content": "29 November 1999 \u2022 Felix Films 23\nTaxi\nMoving from his usual role of director, Luc Besson writes and produces\nhis latest film, Taxi. Set in Marseille, speed-freak taxi driver Daniel\n(Samy Naceri) is caught racing through town by newly promoted Police\nOfficer Emilien (Frederic Diefenthal). Under the threat of losing his\nlicence, Daniel is coerced into helping catch a gang of German serial bank robbers. It quickly becomes clear, after Emilien's bungling\nantics, that he is fighting for his job but more importantly, at least to\nhim, the heart of his stunning blonde superior. The resulting action is\neverything you expect from a Besson production - fast paced, stylish,\noriginal and funny.\nThe direction by Gerard Pires is excellent; particularly the car\nsequences which are arguably better those seen in last summers Ronin.\nAt times you even feel sick as the cars race through the narrow streets.\nThis realism was achieved by Pires insistence on filming in real time\ninstead of shooting in slow motion and speeding the footage up. A number of top rally drivers using 1 10 cars travelling at speeds of up\nto 1 20mph meant areas of the city being blocked off for days at a time. Despite this, the film was shot in only 2 7 days.\nHowever, Taxi is not another Hollywood clone. The music is all written\nand performed by 1AM,a French rap group with origins in Marseille.\nThe characters are old favourites, which lends a certain innocence to\nthe film. Emilien is naive and inept. Daniel on the other hand is street-wise, fast-talking and betrays a cool that even James Bond would be\njealous of. Supporting characters are almost cartoonish in their stereo-typing. Don't get me wrong, this film is not cheesy. It just shows a fraction of Daniel and Emilien's lives without the need for character an aly sis. Another great point is the obliviousness to modern feminism and\nthe Franco-German relationship, with a level of political incorrectness\nthat Hollywood could only dream of.\nOriginally filmed in French, it is available in the UK in two formats -subtitled and dubbed. Generally foreign language films are better\nsubtitled but \u00a31 00k has been spent on the dubbed version employing\nthe London accents of Danny Dyer (Human Traffic) and Jason Fleming\n(Lock, Stock...) to replace the Marseille French. The only disappointing\nthing is the film's length - a mere 85 minutes. But, had it been longer\nthe sheer momentum - one of the film's greatest assets - would have\nbeen lost. Overall this is superb entertainment and great fun. Don't let\nthe subtitles put you of, it's a must see.\nKatberine and Dave\nscreen \\Z3\nThe Astronaut's Wife\nThe Astronaut's Wife belongs in that category of movies which don't know whether they are a science fiction movie or a straight out and out\nthriller. Unfortunately, the movie tries to combine elements from both\ngenre and so falls into the gap occupied by movies such as Species or\nEvent Horizon. Admittedly, I found Event Horizon slightly better than\nthis, but I thought Species was absolute and utter garbage.\nThe movie stars Johnny Depp as Spencer Armacost, an astronaut who,\nwhilst on a routine Shuttle mission, mysteriously loses contact for two\nminutes. He returns to earth alive and is subsequently decorated as a hero. Charlize Theron plays Jillian Armacost, Spencer's loving wife\nwho realises that something is amiss with him after his arrival from\nspace. Spencer quits the space program and proceeds to a new job in\nNew York, a city that he previously hated.\nIn the meantime, Jillian discovers that she is pregnant with twins, news\nthat thrills Spencer. But as time moves on, Jillian proceeds to experience haunting nightmares and strange sounds that seem to coincide\nwith reality. Her increasing sense of paranoia is fuelled by the ramblings of an ex-NASA employee, who tracks her down to tell her that\nall is not well with Spencer. As Spencer's actions become increasingly\nderanged, Jillian realises that she is in a race against time to find the\ntruth and to stop its consequences.\nThe premise and basic set-up of the movie is intriguing enough (if not\noriginal) and the movie starts off well. The director Ravich, who directed Candyman, paces the first hour well and halfway through the movie\nwe get the sense that this could actually turn out to be a good movie.\nBut just as it starts getting interesting, the movie loses its way and the\nfinal outcome just doesn't ring true and seems like it's been tacked on.\nThis can't be helped by some lacklustre acting by Theron, whilst Johnny Depp, in the supposedly pivotal title role, is stuck with a thankless\ncharacter with very little to do, thus leaving his acting talents to go to\nwaste.\nThe movie is billed as a psychological thriller but it never seems to\nachieve the thrills that it's striving for, instead settling for a slight sense\nof unease. Like many recent Hollywood flicks, the main downfall of the\nmovie is the end, which seems like far too simple a resolution and\nmakes the film-watcher seem cheated. Staying for half the movie is\nadvised, but maybe you'd like to walk out before the final reel.\n\u2022 Imran\n\n"

    "content": "34 Sport Felix \u2022 29 November 1999\nBiannual report time Women finish top\nKendo Volleyball\nIts been six months since we\nreported to you on our glorious\nvictory at the University Championships. Well, we're back. Saturday 20th November saw the 26th International Kendo Clubs Championship. As the name suggests, it\nis one of the most prestigious\nkendo competitions in Europe,\nwith over 60 teams entering from\naround the world. It was even\nmore special for the ICU Kendo\nClub, as it was only the second\nmatch in the relatively young history of the team. So there we were,\nthe whole lot of us to support the\ntwo players who represented our\nteam: Koichiro and Tak. Despite\nthe general lack of sleep among\nall members, our team made a promising start and won the first\ntwo matches, but eventually we lost\nto the championship winners (final\nscore 2-3). Our guys put up a real\nfight, for which they were credited\nwith comments that their match\nwas just as, in not more, entertaining than the final! A special round\nof applause goes to Tak, who no\ndoubt was the least experienced\nplayer in the championship\n(Remember, we've only been training for about 5 months) but\nshowed one of the best fighting\nspirits and a great potential for the\nfuture. Well done!\nEven though the rest of us\nweren't fighting, the organisers\nwere sure to keep us busy. In\nkendo, a minimum of five people\nis required to run each two minute\nlong match, and without Imperialtrained rigorous workers, the\nmatches couldn't have run.\nDespite the defeat of our own\nteam, we still had things to celebrate - our much loved teacher\nand coach, Emiko, won the ladies\nindividual event. Last but definitely\nnot least, a very special thanks to\nMr Mabuchi for representing us as\npart of the Imperial squad.\nIt is now official! Imperial College\nVolleyball Club has the best\nWomen's team in London! Our\nsuperb players beat UCL 3-1 last\nweek and thereby clinched top\nplace in the BUSA London com-petition.\nAnd what a superb match it\nwas! After loosing the first set,\ndue to a succession of un forced errors which saw the opposition\nbuild-up a lead of 15 points, IC\ncame back and clinched 3 sets in\na row to win the match. But there\nwas tension all the way through -it wasn't easy, believe me! The\n2nd and 4th sets were incredibly\nclose, since in both of them the\nteams were levelled at 23-23,\ntwo points before the end!\nSo, nail-biting stuff as usual,\nbut Imperial's women showed\ntheir characteristic grit and winning spirit that enabled them to\nfinish on top. Everybody played\nwell, but special mention has to\nbe given to Janice, since it was\nher attacking serve in the first set\nthat provided the clue to what the\ntactics in the following sets\nshould be (nice lesson to the\ncoach...) Cheers too to the brave\ncaptain, Sandrine, who cleverly\nasked for a substitution near the\nclosure of the match so that she\ncould rest for a couple of min-ute s, and then came back onto\nthe field to win the match with a serious of deciding blocks and a fantastic last serve. And what\nabout the attacking and digging\nskills showed by Courtney, Lucia\nand Raphaelle! Wow! That's all I have to say!\nThink your team rocks?\nThen tell us about it!\nIC boys aren t easy\nUltimate Frisbee\nThe weekend of the 20th and 21 st\nNovember saw the Student Indoor\nUltimate Qualifiers for the Southeast region held at Sussex University. The majority of the Imperial\ncrew descended to Brighton at\nsome ungodly hour on Saturday\nmorning, to be there for the 9.30\nstart. The first three matches\nwould be from within a pool of\nfour teams, and the top two in\neach pool going then went into\nthe quarter final playoffs (with the\nwinners of the playoffs guaranteed\na place in the national student\nindoor finals).\nOur first match was against\nKings (aka NoneOfTheAbove),\nfrom which much groaning was\nreceived, considering the rivalry\nbetween the two London teams.\nAfter yelling our newly adopted\nmotto \"There's no I in TEAM!\" we\nwent onto the pitch to kick some\nroyal butt. The first three points\nwent Kings way. However, the DiscDoctors kept their heads high\nand proceeded to get several\npoints on the trot, and Fukwit\ncalmed down after his first drop to\nprove that he was a damn fine\ninjury substitute. Towards the end,\nKings snatched one last point, but\nwe finally won 6-4. After our\n\"warm up game\" we then had to\nface Sub Patriots 3 (aka\nPortsmouth or PDQ). The drubbing of Portsmouth involved lots of\nexperimental set plays, so the\nmatch was a little scrappy, but\nnice cuts and passes from Big Gay\nand Jesus helped us finish 11-3.\nThe final lambs sent to the slaughter within our pool were Mohawks\n2 (aka Brighton). The game was\nvery experimental once again, but\nwith Diva running round like a rabbit on fire and Spirit exhibiting\nhis very solid play, we managed to\nwallop them 10-3. Time for the\nQuarterfinals.\nWe were now against Skunks\n2 (Southampton) and word of\nmouth was flying round that\n\"Imperial were crap\" and \"Skunks\n2 should easily win\". Fatal last\nwords, I'm afraid. IC stopped\nexperimenting and played in our\nnormal crushing manner. The well\noiled combination of Worship Me\nand Waterboy flattened Skunks 2\nfaster than \"Mind that bus\",\n\"What bus?\", \"Splat!\". We qualified for the finals after dic king on\nSkunks 2 1 3-3.\nThat was the end of the first\ndays indoor play, and the charity\nmatch followed outdoors - in the\nrain where it was cold and wet,\nwith Jesus, Diva and Worship Me\nplaying from Imperial's DiscDoctors.\nSunday - Semi finals and\nonwards day. As we were in the\ntop 4, we didn't have to start until\nthe afternoon, so we all got a lay\nin (lovely). We faced Strange Blue\n(aka Cambridge) in the semi-finals, and yet again, the opposition thought that they had the easy\ntie of the round. Whoops. It was a tight fought game, which had\n\"Blue\" fighting for their life to stay\nin the lead for all of the match. In\nthe last three minutes of the\ngame, IC scored two points to\nlevel the scores and force sudden\ndeath extra-time. Unfortunately\n\"Blue\" got the last point to finish\n7-6 up, but we proved that its\nhard to beat IC.\nOur final match was against\nMohawks 1 , who also had a tight\nsemi-final game. Yet again we\nhad a hard fought match, but\nAstrofuk proved that he was more\nthan a pretty face with a defence\nthat was not only tighter than a ducks butt, but also distracted the\nopposition quite admirably. Yet\nagain, we hit sudden death (this\ntime they managed to get the\ndraw), which we won to finish 9-8\nup and in third place (thus matching our original seeding).\nSpecial commendations need\nto go to Diva for his impersonations of a Nutcracker ballerina\nand a monkey for some of the\nafter match calls, and also to the\noral skills of Mrs Worship Me\n(well, he looked happy).\n\n"

    "content": "6 Science Felix \u2022 29 November 1999\nBacterial Terrorists\nClothes that fight BO? Su-Yen Thornhill gets smelly\nThe nineties have seen an increase in bacterial\nwarfare, not between countries but in the home most household cleaning products advertise\nsome sort of antimicrobial function, but good old fashioned bleach is still the best thing to disinfect surfaces. Scientists are now going back to basics and are finding innovative ways of utilising chlorine even to combat body odour. But\ndon't worry, a range of bleach bubble-bath\nproducts is not about to hit the market yet;\nrather scientists are developing antimicrobial clothing that attacks bacteria while you wear it.\nHorses sweat, men perspire, and women glow. That maybe a genteel way of expressing\na slightly unpalatable fact, but, physiologically,\nanybody who gets hot or carries out exercise will\nsweat whether they are male, female or, indeed, a horse. This natural phenomenon is vital to maintaining a constant body temperature, but to\nbe seen to sweat in public is perhaps to commit one of the greatest social faux pas in our cul ture. Sweat patches are considered hideous and most people frantically try to avoid sweating by\ndousing themselves in a range of anti per spi rants.\nThere are two types of sweat: ordinary salty\nwater, which is secreted from the ecr in e glands all over the body, and erogenous sweat secreted\nfrom the apocrine glands that kicked into action\nFair Trade?\nAs you read this, delegates from the 1 3 5 mem ber states of the World Trade Organisation will be meeting in Seattle to discuss forthcoming agreements on the opening up of the world market.\nThis all sounds reasonable, except that what is\nreally going to happen is this: each country is\ngoing to bring along a whopping list of wishes\nand requests, and try to get as many of them\ngranted as possible.\nIf this reminds you of those similar lists that\nyou posted to Father Christmas as a child, then\nwelcome to the 'grown-up' world of international\nnegotiations. And whilst the political bickering,\npushing, shoving and stamping of feet is taking\nplace, a rally of protesters will be parading outside with banners saying \" No to globalisation\" and trouble is expected.\nTwo of the main issues that the protesters\naccuse the WTO of are promoting the deterioration of the environment, enhancing global poverty and enhancing the power of giant industrialised states and multinational corporations. These issues are interlinked.\nWhat the WTO is about is free trade - the\nworld as a huge shopping mall where anyone can sell their products. Now if these products are\nproduced in a way that destroys the environment,\nyou can't do a thing about it. This isn't because at the time of puberty. This secondary sweat is a waxy oily solution produced mostly in the\narmpits and genital areas and its composition is\nunique to each person. Bacteria break down sweat for food, producing noxious compounds that give rise to the characteristic sour whiff of\nBO. For some people no amount of deodorants can combat this smell, and in fact the comb in ation of putrid sweat and deodorant is often more revolting than the sweat on its own. Bacteria thrive on body surfaces and they\nalso transfer on to clothing. For hygienic reasons\nI would hope that most of you wash your socks\nand underwear daily but perhaps it is not fe as i ble to clean your wardrobe every time you wear it or have a bath each time you break out in a sweat. Clothing that disinfects the wearer would therefore seem to be the ideal solution.\nThe idea to make b act eric i dal clothing was first developed by scientists in California who managed to make chlorine molecules adhere to cotton fibres. The movement of the wearer then\nenables the chlorine attached to the clothing to collide with the bacteria and subsequently kill\nthem. And once the chlorine runs out the antimicrobial function can be regenerated by simply\nwashing the treated fabric with a dilute chlorine\nbleach. Unlike antibiotics, which attack specific\ntargets, chlorine hits a wide range of bacterial\nthe WTO ignores the environment completely,\nbecause it doesn't. It just makes sure that the articles relating to the protection of the environment\nare written by linguists. Result: an exception to\nWTO free-trade rules that sounds as if it's pro-environment, but actually isn't.Hence the USA some years back tried to ban Mexican tuna\nimports because this tuna was hugely dolphin-unfriendly because the nets tended to trap dolphins and-drown them.\nThe WTO article that so neatly points out that\nanti-environmental products can be banned from\nentering your market also implies somewhere in\nthe dark recesses of the wor d in g that this ex c ep tion doesn't include products that are anti-environmental in the way they are produced. This is\ndaft: most of the world's environmental problems\nresult from the actual production processes. So, unless the tins of tuna actually emitted some kind\nof radioactive material or caused the surrounding\nvegetation to wither or warmed up the climate,\nthey were passed.\nThis case brings up two issues that the pro testers are screaming about: environmental deterioration and the increasing power of industrialised giants, such as the US. On the one hand, the WTO has overruled an environmental approach( and dolphins lost out)\nMost people frantically try to avoid sweating\nsurface markers making it difficult for the bacteria to become resistant to it.\nThis all sounds very neat but the question\nremains - would one always smell of bleach, which in itself is a somewhat unattractive\nprospect and does that mean we will enter a world where the only colour available to us is\nwhite? Whether constant exposure of the skin to\na chlorine compound will prove harmful is\nanother question, which no doubt will be answered in the fullness of time.\nand bitter infighting\nbut this was to the advantage of the less power-ful, less industrialised nation of Mexico, a fact\nthat the more radical outspoken protesters tend\nto ignore.\nThey also accuse the WTO of creating a global poverty situation by destroying self-sufficiency. Again this is a debatable issue, as the\nGovernment of India ( GOI) is now very well\naware of. It was this very aim, that of self-sufficiency, that was the main cause of deforestation\nand environmental degradation in India.\nA series of five-year environmental action\nplans were carried out from the 1 9 5 0 s, all of\nthem focussing essentially on self-sufficiency.\nNonetheless, the rate of deforestation was increasing. It was only when the GOI got to the\n7th environmental action plan that they realised\nthat economic growth could not goh and in hand\nwith self-sufficiency.\nAnd this is essentially what it all boils down to: economic growth. This is what the WTO is\nabout. This is what all the developing countries\nwant. It seems that trade can open this venue, but\nthe protesters have a point to make. Things are getting too 'big'. Scale is the issue. The global risks are increasing in scale, and where the benefits are huge, so are the pitfalls.\nTANYA ON GARR A Today the World Trade Organisation Summit opens in Seattle to violent protests\n\n"

They cruise onto the\nstage, play their songs and leave without\nmore than just a slight shuffle of the feet.\nSomehow, between these extremes, lies the\nperformance of Soulwax who played the Borderline the other night. Luckily, however, the\nperformance was one that improved as the\nnight went on.\nFollowing on from the eminently forgettable\nopening band Turn (or Turd as one of the bar\nstaff referred to them), the two Soulwax front\nmen appeared on the stage dressed in snappy\nsuits with swaggers that are usually reserved\nfor the cooler members of society. Sadly\nthough, this entrance was spoiled by their two\nopening tunes which, in this situation can be\nperfectly described as Turd-like. Fortunately,\nfrom there things picked up quite nicely.\nSuddenly, energy oozed from the pores of\nSoulwax. The guitars and drums were better\ndefined, the vocals more raw and the Borderline rocked.

The Xerox DocUcenter, which had previously provided a range of re pro graphic services for a reasonable charge has\ndisappeared. In its place there are\nnow a couple of card operated\nblack and white copiers, a facility\nwhich is already provided at many\nlocations throughout college.\nThe DocUcenter died sudden-ly; just before students returned\nafter the summer break. The day\nbefore the closure staff were happily accepting assignments, promising that they would be ready for\ncollection later in the week. Customers returned to find signs on the\ndoors saying the DocUcenter had\nbeen closed. The service had vanished without informing or consulting its users. In previous years\nchanges to the copy shop have\nbeen accompanied by front page\nnews coverage in Felix. A week or\nso after the start of term, the DocUcenter reopened in its present\nincarnation.\nToday's situation has been\ndescribed as an inconvenience for\nclubs, and a big problem for stu-dents. There is no longer anywhere\non the South Kensington campus\nwhere it is possible to request that\na particular chapter of a book, or a file of notes are copied, and return\nto collect them later.\nThe recent history of copy shops on the IC walkway is not particularly bright. The reason .given for the\ndemise of the DocUcenter was that\nit was not making any money.\nHowever in the past it has been\nproved that it is possible to run a viable copying business on the\nwalkway. Callprint, who ran the\nbusiness until May 1997 before\nlosing the contract to Xerox, were\nabout to embark on an expansion\nof their sen/ices. It was envisaged\nthat eventually students would be\nable to transmit a file from any\ncomputer then collect the finished\nFeedback\nproduct at the shop.\nThe return of a copy shop providing services such as: T shirt\nprinting; poster creation; laminating and binding would be of enormous use to both clubs and individuals. Copyshops are able to survive on high streets, so why not on\nthe IC walkway?\nThe Senior Common Room\nredevelopment will provide a retail\nunit which would be an excellent\nlocation for a profitable copy shop. I would suggest that there is no one\nbetter placed to run the service,\nthan iCU. I would love to see the\niCU logo plastered all over the\nSCR's new curvy glass walls. The\nbusiness would be run altruistically,\nand profits used to benefit students.\nAs it would be providing a service\nfor students, it should not matter if\nit were not a big money spinning\nventure. Although unlikely, in an\nideal world college would look\nfavourably on an iCU run venture,\nwhich would provide a useful service to the college community.\nWhat iCU attempt to do,\ndepends on what students want. If\niCU does not run the copy shop it\nshould be pushing for college to\nre-examine the options open to it:\nperhaps the copy shop contract\nshould be put out to tender again.\nThis would give the large high\nstreet re pro graphics companies an\nopportunity to trade in a fantastic\nlocation, and at the same time provide a good deal for IC students.\nThe service that was provided\nby the DocUcenter and its predecessors was one that made a considerable difference to those students who used it, and will be\nmissed.\nRichard Taylor\nBiochemistry II\nFAIR PAY FOR ALL\nDear Felix,\nI note that our equal opportunities officer has persuaded ICU\nto support the NUS march for student rights at ULU this week. The\nposters all state that the aims are\n'No to fees & student hardship'\nand 'yes' to decent pay.

    "content": "29 November 1999 \u2022 Felix Clubs & Societies 33\nOutdoor Club\nNIGEL THACKER\nTwo weeks ago, Imperial College\nCanoe Club went off to North Wales\nin search of some rivers and a bit of\nfun. Here's what we found....\nFollowing a tour round most of\nWest London looking for the Whitewater Canoe Centre, where Garth,\nHicksy, and I hoped to buy our new\nkit we rocked up as they were shut-ting. Still, with \u00a31550 in hand they\ndecided to stay open for a while, and\nsoon after we were walking out with\nsome spanky new kit for Louise to\ntrash. The drive back was made more\nenjoyable as \"Window-Garth\", whilst\nsitting in a traffic jam, went to throw\nhis head out the window to check for\nstray pedestrians, without remembering to check if the window was open\nfirst!\nBack at the stores, things had\nbeen efficiently sorted, and with the\naddition of our two new boats we\nwere off. Arriving in the hut, the group\nbecame more lively with everyone\nhaving a laugh, not least when it\nemerged that Klaus and Simon had\nforgotten their sleeping bags! Introductions to the large Irish contingent\ndrafted in by Carl, a few beers and an\nIrish song or two later, we were off to\nbed.\nOff to the Aber Glaswyn river,\ndue largely to few other options\n(although a clear club favourite for\ntrips anyway). Group confidence was\nbolstered somewhat by the slow\nscrap y upper section leading to a kamikaze run on the Gorge by almost\neveryone present. To no one's surprise carnage followed, and viewing\nthe whole affair from the Breaker (at\nthe bottom) I could normally glance\nup to see three or four boats pinned\nat various points. Oh, and an utter( Ross) leaping from rock to rock fending off flailing kayaks and collecting\nvarious kit. Louise was doing well until\nshe went for the old Hicksy excuse as\nshe tried to break (fairly successfully)\nher paddle. The new curvature must\nhave confused the poor girl, who\nsoon swam. Other spectacular pins\nwere by Klaus actually on the break-er, and Paula in a pretty vertical position a little further up. A good fun way\nto finish the day's paddling.\nChile in the hut (best yet?) then\noff up to the pub for some drinks. A perhaps-too-Iate attempt to get some\nen-masse drinking games going\nfailed abysmally, due either to my\nslurred organisation powers at the\ntime, or the apparent ineptitude\namongst us (I suspect a bit of both). A sober rehearsal of some basic games\nbefore the next trip should perhaps\nreplace a future pool session... Still,\ndrinking continued well into the night,\neven without the impetus of drinking\ngames. A sober driver to take us back\nproved novel (we normally walk, not\ndrink and drive). One more thing\nremained before we could go to bed\n- the initiation ladder back in the hut,\nwith valiant efforts by almost every-one, despite Garth showing his age\n(and hideous gut) as he struggled for\nsome time. I think a few girls even\nmade it up.\nA late awakening on Sunday and\nwe were off to paddle the Flygwy.\nProbably the most excitement for the\ngroup was the sight of Hicksy scraping and bouncing down the Miners\nFalls, taking drops in various positions of forwards, backwards, upright,\nand not-upright. Then a good scrape\ndown the remainder of it for us, taking the odd opportunity for a swim to\nrelieve the adrenaline.\nBy five o 'clock we had all eaten\nlots, had a good weekend's paddling\nand were in the bus heading back. A fantastic first trip, so thanks to everyone who came.\nTo join the Canoe Club email us\n(see below) or join us at the Big Blue\nShack on the walkway at 7pm on\nTuesdays for Canoe Polo.\nContact Nigel\nslap per s@ ic.ac.uk\nAmnesty International\nPATRICK BRANNAC\nRichard Reoch, a long time Amnesty\nInternational member and human\nrights activist, recently visited Imperial College to give a lecture entitled\n'Human Rights: is the world getting\nbetter or worse?' In attempting to\nanswer this question he pointed to\nthe thousands of years of recorded\nhistory where heads of state traditionally enjoyed absolute power with\naccountability to no one. This has\nconventionally led to brutal human\nrights violations such as torture. He\nquestioned the common held stereotype of torture as something that\nhappened only in the dark and distant past, such as that depicted in\nmuseums such as Madam Tussaud's. He referred to a recent event of torture where a man was detained and\ntortured by the Turkish authorities\nusing electrodes attached to his genitals and toes. Torture, he said, has\nnot stopped with 'civilisation'; today's technology can be perverted to\nexact a level of physical pain surpassing all previous efforts.\nDespite such a pessimistic back-ground, he showed a picture that he\nsays could epi to mise a new way of\ngovernment. The slide was of a massacre in Khana, Lebanon, where the\nslain refugees were covered in blankets whilst unarmed soldiers wearing\nthe internationally recognisable blue\nof the UN stood over them. That\ninternational teams of soldiers are\nnow called in to investigate these\nkinds of incidents is, he said, a bold\nnew step out of the age where\nabsolute power could not be held\naccountable for its actions. The trial\nof General Pinochet has shown that\nfurther steps away from this age\n(covering most of recorded history)\nare being made. He concluded that\nthe UN, Amnesty International and\nother organisations, can together\nallow for an optimistic future where\nthe world really is getting better.\nWhether this recent emphasis on\nhuman rights becomes just a historical blip in an otherwise bleak time-line, or the foundations upon which\nthis better world will be based relies\non the actions and involvement of\nindividuals who are prepared to\nwork for the latter.\nIf you would like to join Amnesty\nInternational at Imperial College, or\nwould just like more information,\ncontact Alan (see below), or come\nalong to our next meeting, this Monday (5th Dec.) at 1 pm in the Brown\nCommittee Room (top floor of the\nUnion). It's time to get off the fence.\nContact Alan\nalan.cheng@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Arts Felix \u2022 29 November 1999\nmethod A, Anna Weiss Balm In Gilead Fringe Debate\nWhitehall Theatre - \u00a31 0 standby - Charring Cross Tube Courtyard Theatre - \u00a36, Sun. pay what you can- Kings Cross Gielgud Theatre - 24th Nov.\nThis is not an easy play to watch. It is one and a half\nhours, non-stop, of confrontation and tantrum. The three\ncharacters - a condescending and manipulative hy p no therapist who has 'recovered' a daughter's memories\nof sexual abuse at the hands of her father - have a hard\ntime of it on stage, but they manage to make the tears\nand fits seem convincing. The daughter (Shirley Henderson) in particular was very good, and her jittery unease\nand instability were un forced. You only see a snippet of the story- it's been over a year\nsince the allegations were first made and the play takes\nplace on a single day. The situation comes to a head\nwhen the daughter confronts her father about what he\nhas done. Accusations fly between all three of them and\nnothing gets resolved, which leaves a sense that little has\nactually happened.\nAt times it is gut-wrench ingly moving, but once the wailing really gets under way there are more moments of\ncringing than anything else and you leave with no real\nlasting feelings for any of the characters. Quite an\nachievement considering the seriousness of the topic -but the cause of this is that no one was sure of what actually happened. Everyone's memories were unreliable\nand each had a completely conflicting story. You end up\nsiding mainly with the father because it's hard to believe\nthat this little man in a suit could have done the things he\nis being accused of, and the therapist is so screwed up\nherself you can imagine her planting false memories.\nI feel it was a bit insensitive. To put so much emphasis on\nthe actual abuse when it was really talking about the\nunreliability of memory almost undermines the suffering\nof real victims. Although it does highlight the problem of\nfalse memory and the damage it can cause to people,\nthe play could have done this equally effectively with a little more subtlety.\nToo graphic, too bewildering and, surprisingly, too\nempty.\nThe Courtyard Theatre have put on a play about \"the riff-raff, the bums, the petty thieves, the scum, the lost, the des-per ate, the dispossessed and the cool\"; they've set it in\nKings Cross.\nI went expecting to meet the usual suspects: junkies, pros-t it ute s, pimps, and alcoholics determined to make a life\nfrom their unfortunate situation; perhaps a worthy version\nof \"Rent\", but without the songs. Ba/m in Gilead was written in New York thirty years ago, and the action has been\ntransferred to a Kings Cross all-night cafe. The customers\nare mainly working girls - the economic engines of this tiny\nworld. Pimps and dealers, living off the earnings of the\ngirls, are also represented in the large cast\nThere is no common narrative, the stories of different people unfold in close proximity across the cafe and yet have\nlittle impact on one another. The dialogue switches back\nand forth between the different plot threads with an energy\nthat contrasts with the gloomy situation, the central thread\nfollowing a half-hearted dealer and the American he meets\nby chance over coffee. The American could easily have\nbeen irritating as hell but Jennifer Merna plays her with a refreshing lightness and grace, creating intimacy amid\ncrowded action. The piece is peppered with monologues,\nthe best of which provide real insight, although a few did-n't hit the mark. Particularly affecting was the speech by a young junky, which ended the first half.\nIn the end, the play had no resolution. A drug dealer died\nbut the stories had all begun again and the play ended\nmuch as it had begun. Everyone was trapped in the circle,\nwhich they had entered through choice but could not\nescape. This production very effectively demonstrated what\nit had set out to prove, but the message is perhaps less\nfresh than it was thirty years ago. It is not that the situation\nis less tragic, but perhaps, thanks to TV, it is more familiar.\nThe atmospheric theatre (with its sufficiently decayed set)\nwas largely empty - which is a shame as this is a play well\nworth seeing.\nIt happened in the Gielgud theatre and hardly any body went\nwhich, I suppose, is the whole\nproblem.\nOn the panel was Ben Brown (a \"promising young playwright\"),\nNica Burns (representing the production and management side),\nIan Brown (a director), and Timberlake Wertenbaker (a more\nestablished writer).\nThe debate - or general good\nnatured agreement, as it turned\nout to be - focused on the problem for new writers of bridging the\ngap between fringe and big time\nsuccess.\nIt was agreed that it is much harder nowadays to make such a break. Many reasons for this were\ncited, but none were really followed through.\nNew playwrights are often tempted to give the audience something\n\"familiar or un challenging\" just to\nmake it popular, to make it sell -this has to be damaging in the\nlong run in the search for original\nnew theatre.\nI think that the biggest problem is\nthe hit and miss attitude of the\nfringe. What you see may be fab,\nbut could just be shite. General\nmembers of the public are not\nprepared to take that risk for the\nprice of an average ticket.\nJudith Adams Tom Ben\n\n"

Sounds too good to be true?\nWell that's exactly what I did this summer. I went to the US of A; my flights and my first nights\naccommodation in New York were\npaid for, and I had the summer of my life. I achieved this feat by\nbooking myself on a BUN A Csu mmer camp programme. BUN AC, in\ncase you've never heard of them, arrange working holidays for students and young people to places like America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and a selection of developing countries.\nYou can either choose to find a job in one of these places, or work on one of the summer camps in\nAmerica BUN AC simply provide the opportunity for you to go, by\norganising your working visa as\nwell as helping you to get out there. I thought a summer spent in\na foreign country acting in a counsellor role with kids would be a good idea,s oI decided to become a special needs counsel lor on a summer camp in New York.\nAfter an informal interview I had to wait for what seem like\nages to find out if I had got a place at camp. Eventually I found out that I was successful and where I would be going. The feeling of elation that I experienced was soon followed by trepidation, as I realised exactly what I had signed myself up for ie up to three and a half months in a foreign country\nwith people I had never met. Once I had got to the airport, however,\nand met other people going to camp, those feelings quickly sub sided. On the plane everyone was chatting, asking people where they\nwere going and what they were\ndoing, and imbibing large quant i ties of free alcohol. After stag ge ring through passport control, piling on to the ' BUN AC bus' to the free accommodation they had provided in New York, we all spent a night exploring one of the most\nvibrant cities in the world. After a good day in New York\nit was off to camp with one of the\ncounsellors to be working on the\ncamp with me.I arrived to find that\nI was to spend my time looking after the teenage boys. At the beginning of campI took the kids\naround to all of the activities. The funniest thing I remember saying,\nto my teenage boys, was \"right\nguys, its time for sewing\". The work\nwas really challenging, as I had to make sure all the kids were receiving enough attention, all the time,\nbut it was also very rewarding\nespecially when the kids would thank you orsay \"Matt I'm so happy\". Of course, there were rare\ntimes when you wished the kids\nweren't there, but these rare\nmoments were outweighed by the\ngood times. The American kids\ndidn't turn out to be as bratty as\nthe ones portrayed in American sit-coms and I managed to establish\na really good relationship with all of them. After two months at camp,I couldn't wait togo travelling. A friend and I decided to go around the East Coast by train. In two weeks of travel we managed to\nenjoy the delights of New York,\nvisit Bill Clinton's house in Washington DC, visit New Orleans, say\nhello to Elvis in Memphis and then\ngo whitewater rafting in Pittsburgh,\nbefore returning just slightly tired\nto New York.\nAll in all, I have never had such a good summer and met so many different and interesting\npeople. If you want to do the same\nit is incredibly easy to do, so don't wait! Contact Katie Smith or me for more info; if you want to go you won't regret your decision.

    "content": "Big Issue Felix . 29 November 1999\nWye College\nDAVID ROBERTS Imperial College's seemingly end less quest for expansion will take\nanother major step forward next\nsummer, when a massive new cam pus is added to the College. Wye College will add several new disciplines, almost 1 0 0 0 students, and several hundred acres of farmland to the College, along with the title\nof \"third oldest educational institution in the UK\"( the foundations of\nWye were laid in the mid-fifteenth\ncentury).\nSo, what's going on? Where, what and who is Wye College, and why on Earth is this seemingly obscure outpost of the University of\nLondon about to be added to the\nIC Empire?\nWhere?\nWye College is to be found deep in\nthe heart of rural Kent, not far from Ashford and along way off the\nbeaten track, having been founded in 1 4 4 7 by Cardinal John Kempe as a college for priests. When the\nmerger was first announced, much was made of Ashford' s role as a major spur in the Channel Tunnel\nproject - when the much vaunted rail-link finally comes on-line, land\nvalues around Ashford are likely to\nrocket, as freight and haulage c en tres become two-a penny. The College's ultimate plans for its copious grounds has still to be determined. However, Wye' s academic importance should not be underestimated. Although largely unheard of amongst the general populace( a problem all IC students know well), Wye is in fact one of the fore most centres for agricultural teach ing and research in the UK( the new agricultural courses will be added to the Royal School of Mines, and may eventually become a part of\nthe Huxley School) - indeed the\nreaction of the first Wye students I spoke to was that they feared that\nthe quality and worth of their\ndegrees would diminish as a result\nof the merger.\nWye also has some decent research and teaching groups in\nplant and animal biology, countryside management and the (now\nobligatory) study of management. Above all, however, it's Wye' s reputation for crop and GM research\nthat has most attracted the hand of\nImperial, and drawn the long-lost\nCollege back into the limelight.\nHow?\nAs of August1 st next year, Wye will\nbecome a part of Imperial College( and it's students will become members of Imperial College Union)so what differences will we notice?\nWell, to begin with, probably none. Wye students will remain in Kent\nand Imperial students will remain in\nSouth Ken there certainly don't seem to be any plans to move bits\nof College down there in the foreseeable future. However, over the\nnext couple of years we can expect\nto see a slight realignment of certain departments, as they merge with their Wye counterparts, lea ding to the formation of several \"with\na year in Wye\" courses (most pro b ably in certain Biological disciplines\nand perhaps elements of the Huxley\nSchool). Similarly, the remaining Wye courses (all courses which overlap those at IC seem set to dis-appear) will probably move towards including spells in South\nKen. And the net result? In all like-li hood, more students on the South\nKen campus.... The other element of the mer ger (sadly the terms \" takeover\" and\" buyout\" don't exist in academic terms) is an organisational one. As the medical mergers brought the\nrank of \" principal\" to IC, the Wye merger will introduce the concept of \" provosts\", with the senior academic at Imperial to be deemed the\nProvost of Imperial at Wye( note\nthat this will be a separate role to\nthat of ahead of department or dean of a constituent college, as\nWye will be neither). Beyond this,\nthe exact organisational makeup is\nstill unclear, and will depend on the\nexact format of the course structure\nthat is eventually agreed. In Union terms, however, a semi-autonomous Wye Union( run as a sub-section of ICU) seems the most\nlikely outcome, with the question of\na sabbatical Wye President still to\nbe debated( note that Wye don't have a sabbatical at present, but\nthe need for regular contact with\nthe South Ken campus may make one essential).\nWhere next?\nSo, considering that over the course\nof three years the College will have\ngrown to the tune of a couple of\nthousand students and four main campuses( note that this list doesn't include St Mary's, who have been part of IC since 1 9 8 7 ) , where are we heading? Having gained medi cine and agriculture as extra strings\nto our bow, what notable absences remain (bearing in mind that the\nCollege charter is strict on the fact\nthat Imperial must remain scientifi c/ technological in outlook)?\nWell, if campus gossip is to be\nbelieved, veterinary science is the\nnext major target, with the Royal\nVeterinary College a suggested goal. However, with the problems surrounding medical mergers across London and the controversy\naccompanying UCL' s continuing attempts to take over every other\ncollege in the University of London( SO AS and SEESS are presently at\nthe top of their hit list), the driving\nforces behind the merger processes\nseem to have died down, at least\nfor the moment. Nonetheless, it' almost one hundred percent certain that mer gers will continue to be a top priority for the heads of all of the University of London' s major Colleges( IC,\nUCL, Q MW, Kings, LSE and Royal\nHolloway), because only through\ncontinued expansion can these colleges generate the impetus and the\nfinancing necessary to develop and regenerate their campuses and facilities - and nowhere is this more important that at Imperial. The medical merger gave us a nice\nshiny new building( soon to be\njoined by a second when the MDR B becomes a reality) and the Wye merger will undoubtedly help to\nfinance the RS M redevelopment( as\nwell as giving us an incredibly\nimpressive fifteenth century Cam bridge-style quad in Kent). As is\noften pointed out, unlike Oxbridge( or many other universities) the College has very little spare cash to\nfinance new initiatives, and consequently it's only through mergers\nthat Norman Foster's vision of\nCampus Renaissance can become a reality...\n\n"

    "content": "29 November 1999 \u2022 Felix Sport 35\nFifths in 1\n2 goal thriller Sevenths victorious again\nFootball Football\nIC V6 Goldsmiths IV 6\nAfter last weeks outstanding performance against the medics to take\nus joint top in the division, IC V's were in confident mood, intent on\nkeeping the run of wins going to\nmove clear of the pack.\nBut Goldies had different ideas,\nand they brought a team of mouth y big ba*****s, who spent the whole\ngame shouting abuse at us and the\nref. They could play a bit too, unfortunately, and after a first half in\nwhich we had our butts kicked, we\nwere 4-0 down at the break, with\nour defence and midfield having no\nanswer to the Goldies power\nBut the IC V's never say die, and\nwe got stuck in straight away in the\nsecond half, the game suddenly\nlooking more even. Then, on about\n55 mins, a free kick was awarded\nabout 30 yards out. On advice from\nthe captain, JP stepped up and had\na crack, which sailed unstop p ably into the net, off the underside of the\ncross-bar (practically taking their\nkeeper with it). 4-1. The muted celebrations showed we were still well\nadrift in the game, but we suddenly\nkicked into gear, our attacking play\nstemming from MOM performances\nfrom Tom W and JP in midfield, with\nRich and Tiger putting in tireless\nwork out wide, and the front two of\nTom L and Vine showing they had\nthe beating of Goldies back line. A second goal arrived from the boot\nof Tom W,a great shot from the\nedge of the area. We sensed there\nwas a way back, and scored a third\nfrom Spaceman, before JP decided\nthat one 30 yard s creamer was not\nenough for the day, and thumped in\nanother fantastic goal for 4-4. A cool finish from Spaceman when\none on one with the keeper after a great through ball from Tom put us\ninto the lead, and when Vine placed\na brilliant far post header back\nacross the goal and in, it was 6-4,\nand we had come from the dead\nwith six unanswered goals.\nSadly, the effort we had put in\nbegan to tell, and with 10 minutes\nstill to go a hopeful Goldies shot\nflew into the top corner to make the\nlast moments of the game all too\nclose. With only seconds to go, a cross from the left came over, eluding our defence, and the header\nlooped in to make it 6-6. Shit.\nIC VII more\nRVC less\nAfter last weeks thrashing of the\nPharmacists, we arrived at this\nmatch looking for another team to\ndestroy. We arrived slightly late\nthanks to some inept coach driving,\nbut we still got there.\nDespite the gloomy conditions,\nspirits were high. Unfortunately, we\nwere playing into the wind in the\nfirst half and RVC made full use of\nthis, putting pressure on our\ndefence right from the start. Eventually the break that RVC had\ndeserved came from a corner when\nthey exploited our lack of height to\nget a head towards goal, beating\nthe otherwise superb keeper all\nends up - fortunately man-of-the-match Andy Smith was there to\nhead it away. Unfortunately it\ndropped straight to one their players who calmly put it in the back of\nthe net. After a while we picked\nourselves up, and with the weather\nbrightening we pressed forward,\nwith Marcus finally putting the ball\nin the net, after Mark squared him\nright on the stroke of half time. The\ndebate still rages over whether it\nwas intentional or Mark missed yet\nanother blatant opportunity.\nLifted by the goal and an inspirational team talk by the g uv 'nor,\nIC pressed forward in the second\nhalf, finally getting into the lead\nwhen a corner from Leacho managed to work its way to Matt, who\nplaced it clinically into the back of\nthe net (well that's how he tells it\nanyway). Pressing forward as we\nwere, we soon discovered the\nmatch wasn't over as RVC broke\nseveral times, at one point aided by\nBarney (the team alcoholic) who\naimed to clear the ball but managed to make contact with nothing\nbut air, letting their striker clean\nthrough on goal. Fortunately,\nCaprano was on hand to make a match winning challenge. The only\nother point worth mentioning was\nwhen Andy Smith, obviously bored\nwith playing defence, tried to score\nfrom about thirty yards out. Longley\ncollected the ball on the left touch-line - nice try Andy but better stick\nto defence. A pretty good performance by the team as a whole and\nanother win to chalk up. We're\nstarting our run - watch out Gold's, here we come.\nLadies edged out by UCL Netball slay St. George's Ladies Basketball Netball\nUCL 46\nIC 44\nThe game started well, since UCL\ndid not use the full court press\nright away (as we had feared\nbefore the game), and we managed to stick to their score and\noccasionally even move ahead by\na few points.\nAt the end of the first half,\nUCL was ahead by 4 points. But\ntiredness in the middle of the second half made us make some\nmistakes, while our opponents\nwere still sharp and stole a couple of balls, putting us down by\nas much as 12 points. After a time-out to re-adjust our positions, we did a few nice actions\nthat brought us back to within just\ntwo points with 15 seconds\nremaining on the clock. Unfortunately, we did not manage that\nlast basket...\nBut cheer up everyone! This\nresults shows again the high\npotential of this year's team.\nIndeed, King's College, the only\nteam who beat us before this\ngame, lost by more than 1 Opoints\nagainst UCL, scoring only 25.\n(We will see how much we\nimproved, since we should play\nthem next week).\nMoreover, we really deserved\nthe victory and we will have it\nnext time we meet UCL (maybe\nsome improvement on free-throws will help?)\nHopefully, the second game\nof this week against RUMS (new-comers to the league) should be\neasier...\nIC I40 St George's II 26\nOur first league match of the season started with a convincing win\nand a fantastic match. Having\ndrawn 17-17 with St. George's first\nteam a few weeks ago in the BUSA\nleague, we were determined to put\nin a good effort - and we did not\ndisappoint.\nJess played an absolute blind-er, taking on nearly every St.\nGeorge's player and intercepting\npasses that went anywhere near\nher. The St. George's players got\nannoyed. We loved it!\nShirley (the !eg end that is) also\nhad a storming game, zipping\naround the circle and shooting\nsome serious hoops. A medal goes\nto Sarah, our other shooter, for her\npatience and restraint in not decking the St. George's keeper at\nnumerous points during the match\nwhen the marking got particularly\n\"tight\". The physical tension in the\ncircle became apparent in the third\nquarter when the bolt fixing the net\nand ring to the netball post\nbecame dislodged and the hoop\nslipped a good foot down the pole.\nNo matter, Shirley still scored. As\never, Paula whipped the passes into\nthe circle, and later Jane, Kirstie,\nRuth and of course the ever present\nJess fed the ball up from the defensive end. Partnering Rachel in the\nIC goal third was Kathryn, who put\nin a great performance in her\ndebut for the firsts as keeper. So, a good start to the league - let's see\nif we can keep it going! Next week\n.... ICSM.\n\n"

    "content": "The Student Newspaper of Imperial College\n29 November 1999: issue 1159\n-'\nPrepare yourself for an intense\nemotional ride with Anna Weiss\noo cp24 No consultation on Charing Cross loss\nMANSO OR CH OUDH URY The library in the Reynolds Building\nat Charing Cross is to be moved to make way for the Centre for Drug and Health Behaviour, which faces\neviction when its current lease expires.\nThe library, which currently\noccupies the top two floors of the\nbuilding, is to be moved down a level and refurbished. The third\nfloor will house the Centre for Drug and Health Behaviour, as we'll as two General Care departments, which are moving from St Mary's and Westminster hospitals.\nThe major bone of contention with the move is that although discussions started in May, the Cha ring Cross Library Users Committee allegedly only learned about it in\nThe library building\nOctober. The President of ICU, Tasha Newton, said she was in\n\"complete despair\" over the situation as there had been no consult ation between those in charge of the\nproject and the students based at\nCharing Cross who actually use the\nPhotorDavid Roberts\nlibrary. Concerns were raised over\nloss of resources, the student common room, gym and games room would be affected. Ms Newton said\nthat she und er stood that the library\nwould get the refurbishment it\nneeded, but felt that the lack of\nconsultation was shocking. To this\nend, a petition has been organised to make the Imperial College Steering Committee aware of this\nunhappiness with the current plans.\n' According to Peter Griffiths the\nDeputy Secretary of ICS M, there will\nbe an open meeting at 5 pm on the\n3 0 th of November in the Drewe Lecture Theatre, at Charing Cross. All students are invited to discuss\nthe project.\nMr Griffiths pointed out that\nHammersmith, the local NHS Trust,\nwas very pleased with the move which would place a number of\ndepartments into a good, central\nlocation. The141 study places already present would be safe-guarded It is very unlikely that any\nwork will be done on the library\nuntil after the finals in June.\nGuilds pull in the fresher s and pile on the profits\nSUNIL RAO Atlantis, the City and Guilds Freshers' Dinner, took place on Friday, 1 9 November, and was pronounced a success by nearly all that attended. This success should help to negate much of the bad press\nwhich surrounded Guilds less\nsuccessful events earlier this term( see Felix 1 1 5 7 ) , and will ease the\nadverse pressure which has been mounting on C&G's President, Dines hG an esa rajah. Over two hundred and ten people bought tickets for the event, which included blackjack tables, a disco and a mini cinema screening\" The Matrix\". All of this\ntook place within the confines of the Senior Common Room( SCR)\nin the S her field Building. The evening kicked off with\ngrace from Prof Brian Briscoe, the\nDean of City and Guilds College. The three course meal was punctuated by a vociferous rendition of the Guilds song, the Boom a la ka,led by the Guilds President,\nand the attention of all who were gathered was soon raised to the CGC U mascots, Spanner and Bolt, not to mention the1902 antique car, Boanerges, which had been enterprising ly driven on to the Queens' Lawn. The alcohol flowed freely all evening, with\nover three-quarters of a bottle of wine per student - a small number of inebriated fresh ershad to be carried out, as is usual with\nevents of this kind. The event was both socially and financially a success, with Mr Gan esa rajah confirming that a healthy profit had been made, certainly more than sufficient to\nwipe out the well publicised losses the Union had suffered earlier this term. Notable failures of the \"Star War z Disco\" and the \"Raiders\nwere the Lost Bus\" events, which did not lose a lot of cash but did lose credibility for Dines hG an esa rajah. While Atlantis did not official ly sell out, the turnout was greater than has been seen in the past\nfew years, and was certainly greater than had been expected, with over a quarter of the fresher s from the Engineering departments attending.

    "content": "16 Music Felix \u2022 29 November 1999\nfrequency y/^ Only a few weeks to go until\nthe end of the year and\nonce again the thought of\nend of year polls rears it's ugly head. Here in frequency I can assure you that\nwe'll be doing the same.\nProbably a best dance\nalbum, best indie album,\nbest overall album, etc etc.\nYes, it may be unoriginal,\nbut we all love these lists, so\nnext week I 'll be giving you\ndetails of how you can have\nyour say. Early suggestions\nfor best overall album\ninclude Travis, Basement\nJaxx and Groove Armada,\nbut who am I to influence\nyour choices?\n... frequency...\nwe review music\nAs for competitions, well\nwe're packed full of them at\nthe moment. This week\nwe've got Metallica, Counting Crows and Bryan Adams\nCDs up for grabs. Then, in\nthe next two weeks, you\nshould look out for some\nBeastie Boys prizes and a massive Loud Records give\naway. There's also no shortage of well known reviews\nfor the coming weeks, and if\neverything goes to plan then\nour Christmas bumper issue\nshould be a beauty. Finally,\nfor anyone still looking for\nclubbing ideas and doesn't need a weekend off then\nAlex's Cross recommendation should not be over-looked. Saturday's will\nnever be the same again!\nMixed by Karl Tuff Enuff' Brown\nPure Silk\n(Pure Silk)\nAfter running things in London and ramming the P' za zz club in Aiya Napa,\nPure Silk unleash their latest attack on dance music. In pursuit of music\nfor the millennium they have selected only the finest in UK house and\ngarage featuring a number of unreleased tracks. Produced to appeal to\nthe wider audience, the mixing of styles will blow away all-comers. Kicking off with Pure Silk's personal intra it establishes an irresistible flow, just\nmake sure you have a couple hours free before you start listening.\nCurrently topping the dance charts, the compilation is packed with floor-filling tunes. The mix of anthems, new releases and exclusives means the\nusual quota of suspect dubs and dry vocal mixes is kept to a minimum.\nAll tastes are catered for: the bass heads will be rocking to the phat b lines of Ifs the Way and tea Trumpet Thing, anthem lovers won't get\nenough of Straight from the Heart and those up for the new releases will\nbe wearing out the Artful Dodger's Rewind, which is poised to blow-up in\nthe charts.\nKarl 'Tuff Enuff' Brown is at the decks on this one and lives up to his hefty\nreputation. One of the biggest names in garage, the master mixer adds\nhis inimitable style to the album, keeping it smooth for the lighter tracks\nand letting the cuts and tougher mixes loose on the harder tunes. The\nproduction is tight, making use of fresher versions of popular releases.\nThe double CD collection is linked by Karl Brown's intros and sign offs,\nand there are also regular reminders of whose album it is with periodic\nPure Silk cut-ins. The clubs are far more suited to these effects than the\ncompilations are.\nAccording to the exclusive tracks the future of UK garage lies in a collaboration between vocalists and the effects desk. These pre-release tunes,\nincluding a Tuff Jam-Todd Edwards partnership, will keep the garage fans\njumping right through the millennium.\nThis is undoubtedly essential listening, a cut above the deluge of millennium compilations flooding the stores. It is not often you can pick up a collection of the old alongside the new, and with Mr Tuff Enuff on form\nthis is the definitive house and garage assortment. The word is the album\nhas done so well that Karl Brown has been called back to the studio to\nrecord another hour of pure mixing. This will be released as a limited edition CD along with the standard compilation on 27 December. Get the\nalbum, stick it in your system, lie back and let euphoria ensue.\n\u2022 AWOL\nGatecrasher Mix\nDisco-Tech\n(INCredible)\nSince the emergence of the super clubs there\nhas been no shortage of endorsed mixes on the\nmusic market. It seems as if a week never goes\nby without a Ministry, Cream or Gatecrasher\nrelease. These mixes also always appear to follow quite a similar line; they never seem to take\nthe risks required to lift the mix above the many\nother mix CDs out there.\nThe endorsement on this release comes from\nGatecrasher. For the uninitiated, Gatecrasher is\nwithout doubt the super club of the northeast.\nLocated in Sheffield and winner of Muzik's prestigious Best Club award for the last two years)\nGatecrasher is only one step down from the\nhousehold name that the Ministry has become.\nHowever, the question here is not whether\nGatecrasher is a good club. It is whether this\nmix is worth parting with fifteen pounds for.\nWell, I'm sad to say this, but probably not.\nOne problem with these mixes is that there are\nfar too many of them and therefore it is only the\nvery excellent ones that stand out. Another\nproblem is that although many of them are\ngood mixes, many of them do sound very sim-i lar. So, with Disco-Tech the package is to be as\nexpected - good tunes, good mixing, but sadly\nnot much to make it stand out. We get one of\nthe lighter mixes of the Bedrock classic Heaven\nScent, Paul van Dyk's storming new Avenue\ntrack and a beautiful beginning to the second\nCD before the mix beaks out with the new Skip\nRaiders tune Another Day. However, these high\npoints are not enough to lift this good mix to a truly excellent level. My advice for anyone interested is still to spend the fifteen quid, but to\nspend it on Sasha's Global Underground Ibiza\nmix or John Digweed's Bedrock mix, and leave\nthis to those impressed by the badge.\nJ Patch\n\n"

Yes, like all\ngood c lubbers, even Boycey\nneeds some time off and it is\nwith this review that I urge all\nof you to take some time off\nevery now and then to go\nhome and see your parents.\nI think it was due to that awful\nMonday feeling that prompted me to 'just say no' and take\na train out to the Home\nCounties. Somehow, I even\nmanaged to keep this feeling\nwith me all the way through\nthe week to enable me to take\nthat train. Anyway, as I expected the weekend at\nhome was boring, dull and\nuninteresting. However, there\nis one thing I like about home\n- it reminds me of how good\nwe all have it here in London.\nIt is also at home where I find\nmy inspiration.\nAmong the inbred s and old\npeople that flourish so prevalent ly in the area is the source\nof why I came to London and\nwhy I came to find my life the\nway I live it now. I suppose\nthat some people may disagree with the way I do\nthings, but if I don't care, why\nshould they? And a wise man\nonce said to his parents - if\nyou don't ask me no ques-t ions, I won't tell you no lies.\nBoycey\nRenaissance @ The Cross\n... one of the best nights around...\nThe first thing that strikes you about the Cross is its tiny size; it has\na quoted capacity of 350. Set in four disused railway tunnels it has\na low brick-lined ceiling which gives it a dark underground feel.\nAll four of the tunnels play the same music with the DJ booth located on the darkened main dance floor in the principle cavern. The\nothers serve as: a chill out area with seating/bar; a second quieter\nand brighter dance floor/bar; and a second chill out/VIP tunnel.\nAlso available is a chill-out garden.\nAnthony Pappa started the proceedings with a well constructed set\nwhich slowly built up both tempo, tension and volume as the club\nfilled, by 1 am the club was packed and it was time for Danny Howells to take the stage. The first hour of his set consisted of good\nthough not necessarily awe-inspiring music, then around two he\nbegan to really assert himself on the dance floor; perfectly judged\nand mixed tune followed perfectly judged and mixed tune. The\nclearly \"ecstatic\" crowd loved it and responded appropriately to the\nmusic that was as good as deep house gets. Danny Howells was in\ncontrol and in command.\nIan Ossia followed at 4am and clearly did not suffer from 2nd DJ\nsyndrome his \"trance y\", less beat orientated and more emotional\nstyle worked well and the atmosphere in the club was maintained at\nits peak. Indeed the emotion got too much for one group of club ers who fell into a group hug, then with tears running from their eyes,\nraised their arms into the air as one while the breakdown built, then\nerupted back into motion when the beat came back in. This is not\nthe sort of euphoria a soul-less super club like The Ministry or home\ninspires.\nIndeed, it is the little things that make this club stand out from the\npack: like the way the dance floor is full, but not so crowded you\ncant move, or the way they provide cool drinking water and not\nsome unwanted pound coin demanding attendant in the toilet. I could go on for a number of paragraphs about how the little things\nmake Renaissance @ The Cross better than other places, but in the\nend it's the atmosphere that makes the club and it has the best\natmosphere of any London night I 've been to.\nRecommended\nClubbing\nRenaissance is every Saturday at The Cross from 10pm may cost \u00a31 5, but this still represents great value\n6am.

Then again, it's not every day\nthat DJ Shadow puts his backing to a new hip-hop crew.\nFor the uninitiated, DJ Shadow is one of\nthe most understated of the true influences of music today. His debut Entroducing album has had an effect on the\nmusic of the late nineties that is perhaps\nunparalleled. Indeed, it could be said\nthat the music at the cutting edge of end\nof millennium hip-hop would not have\nexisted without this mighty man. Mos\nDef, Company Flow and Jurassic Five\nhave a lot to thank DJ Shadow for, first\nwith his lessons in tune construction and\nsampling, and now with the emergence\nof Blackalicious we see another super\nact appear from the Shadow school of\nbeats.\nLike Jurassic Five's eponymous Jurassic\nFive, N/A is another album that will\nsoon take it's place among the classic\nalbums of hip-hop. It positions itself so\nwell with beats, sound and lyrics that it\nis not surprising that the mighty Shadow\nhas had his paws on the production\ndials. The first single from the album,\nDeception, is a tune from the gods, and\na number of the other tracks stand head\nand shoulders above any tune that any\nother hip-hop crew has had to offer for\nquite a while\nBlackalicious? Absolutely delicious\nmore like. Ignore this at your peril.\nWhat is it with even-numbered albums? I mean, as a rule\nthe even-numbered ones are the shit ones. Yeah, you get\nexceptions to the rule like Nevermind and Led Zeppelin II\nbut the second album is rarely as good as the debut. Korn\nfollow this rule to a tee. Their first album was a cracker\nwith all the metal press touting them as the future. Then\ncame Life Is Peachy and it all went pear-shaped with too\nmuch dirty sex and a dire cover of the War classic Lowrider. Follow The Leader came next and we saw a return to\nform, if somewhat same y and with an annoying first\ntwelve tracks of bugger-all before any music came on.\nAnd now we've been given issues.\nSomeone really needs to tell the boys in Korn the meaning of the words \"progression\" and \"innovation\". All we\nhave here is a rehash of the same formula that's been so\ndominant on all three of their previous albums. Except it's not as good the fourth time around. Jonathan Davis'\nvocals are still harsh and pained on the choruses and\nmiserable on the verses, only he seems to have got as\nbored with the whole thing as I have. He's not giving his\nall to any of the tracks, even when you want to hear him\ncoughing up a lung in those scary angry bits. Munky and\nHead still give it total distortion in all the right places with\nseven string guitars, and David and Fieldy make up the\ncolossal rhythm section on pounding skins and funky bass\nrespectively. So yes, all the elements of the sound are\nthere, yet there's no life or feeling and it's gone stale.\nKom have fallen into such a big rut that the whole thing\nmerges into a big mess of noise. It's quite an impressive\nwall of sound and the slapped bass/funky drumming\ncombo still has the power to disturb, but there is nothing\nnew. Okay, I liked the flange guitar on Somebody Someone and the bagpipes on Dead, but apart from that nothing stood out. That's not to say this won't appeal to anyone - there are still going to be kids wanting to rebel and\npeople who think the band are cool - but it's simply too\nmuch like anything they've previously released. I 'll wait\nuntil their fifth album before I say they're has-been s. Nuophonic Artists\n02 - Label Compilation\n(Nuophonic)\nThis compilation of tunes from the Nuphonic\nstable is, as you'd probably expect, a bit of a mixed bag. Most of it is in the same funked up,\njazzy, chilled out vibe - but varying in quality.\nWith so many different artists on this album,\nyou have to respect Nuphonic for managing to\nmaintain a feel - I can't help feeling that while\nensuring the groove continues, the quality\ntakes a bump occasionally.\nWhile Moving Cities by Faze Action starts off\nthe proceedings nicely, with an acoustic mix of\nHammond and violins lifting you up, Michael\nby Roy Davis Jr felt like I was being brought\nback to earth with a bump. While the quality of\nhis bongo player is not in question, the throaty\nvocals just didn't do it for me. Just to confirm\nthe trend, The String Thing by Soul Ascendants\nis a superb track - blending Latin rhythms, wah-wah he d guitars and some deliciously dark vio-lins.\nThis theme continues for the rest of the album\n- with standout tracks like the fantastically\ncheeky My Beat by Blaze followed by the slightly lame The Sky is Not Crying by Tiny Trendies.\nThe real downer is that Born Under Punches by\nFuzz Against Junk is actually quite a good, if\nslightly 80-ish track - but taken after the Tiny\nTrendies, even Paperback Writer wouldn't have\na chance to rock out. There are a couple of\nstinkers in there - but I can see at least My Beat\nbecoming a bit of an underground club tune -with those fronting lyrics, you can't help but\nsmile.\nThe compilation is a journey - if you are prepared to take a little bit of rough with plenty of\nsmooth, smooth grooves, you will be richly\nrewarded.\nID James IDD Christian\nIDD\nJoel\n\n"

This in turn has caused the\nsealing-off and closure of part of\nthe College kitchens while the\nasbestos is removed.\nDue to the health risks associated with asbestos, all the necessary precautions have been taken\nto ensure there is no contamination of food whatsoever. The\naffected contaminated areas have\nbeen professionally sealed off,\nwith constant monitoring of air\nquality in place to guard against\nthere being any kind of leakage\nwhile the asbestos is being\nremoved. The work was not\nexpected to be on a large scale at\nall. In fact, the original estimate\nfor the completion of the necessary removal work was just one\nweek. The majority of the time was\nexpected to be taken up by the\nactual setting up and' taking down\nof the required safety-related\nstructures and equipment, which\nensure that none of the dangerous\nfibres escape detection.\nFelix were unable to contact\nEdward Lilley, the Catering Manager, before going to press. However, we have been reliably\ninformed that the problem is well\nunder control, and the Main Dining Hall should be back up and\nrunning at its full levels of service\nvery shortly, quite possibly by the\ntime this issue is published.\nSUNIL RAO\nResearch being carried out at\nGoldsmith's College suggests that\nthe racial or ethnic origin of a student at Cambridge often has an\neffect on the class of degree that\nstudent finally ends up with.\nA study that has examined\ndegree results for the years of\n1997 and 1998 has revealed\nwhat many have long suspected -there is a statistically significant\nrelationship between the ethnic\nbackground of a student and the\nclass of degree the student finally\nends up with.\nThe picture isn't all negative -the study shows that while only\n27% of Indians who apply to\nCambridge actually get in, 24% of\nthose that do walk away with a first, as opposed to the 2 1 % of\nwhite undergraduates that do.\nHowever, only one black student\nout of the 32 surveyed gained a first at Cambridge, and with just\nsix blacks getting a2:1 or better\n(as opposed to 80% of all white\nstudents), the figures illustrate\nquite clearly how ethnicity is associated with academic inequality at\nCambridge. Moreover, almost a sixth of all black students there get\na third, whereas just one Chinese\nstudent surveyed (out of 56)\nobtained a third in the past two\nyears. The survey clearly has\nweaknesses in the numbers sur-v eyed, but the results are still sig-n if i cant. The research is still ongoing and is part of an effort to\nensure equality at the university.\nEncouragingly, 1 999 shows a doubling in the number of black\napplicants accepted at the university.

My favourite has to be\nHalf Life: Opposing Force. An official add on pack for my (and pretty much every one else's) favourite\nPC game, Half Life. Never before\nhas an expansion pack for a game\nbeen the subject of so much\nexpectation. From the previews it\nlooks amazing and I can't wait to\nget my hands on it.\nAlso out this week is Unreal Tournament. With loads of hectic multiplayer combat options and excellent Bots to fight if no humans will\nplay with you, this looks like being\na strong competitor with Quake 3\nfor the First Person Shooter crown.\nIf you've got a little too much time on your hands this game will more than adequately fill this passage and then some. A beautiful smooth creation, Jet Force\nGemini introduces you to a futuristic fantasy world where Starship Troopers\nmeet Star Wars with a hint of cult.\nYou control two skiing clothed characters (and a dog) around more levels than\nI'd care to imagine, trying to blow apart giant pistol packing ants whilst rescuing Tribals (furry little Ewok type creatures).\nJumping, bobbing, shooting stuff down and generally kicking ass to moody little back beats, this game takes a while to master but once done the controls are\nlike second nature. The firing is auto-aiming if pointing in the direction of villainous scum, and you can pick off annoying snipers with a targeting facility.\nWith a range of multi-talented teammates to find and use it is possible to tag-team it through the different levels using each character's special ability. The\nwide range of exotic weaponry, cheats, new levels and hidden stuff (apart from\nthe absolutely massive worlds - only rivalled by Zelda for sheer size) ensures\nthat there is enough to keep even the console hardened nut case happy.\nA nice feature is the added intelligence of the nasty bad boys who can be seen\nhiding behind cover before shooting your ass. It makes their final disintegration\ninto fly covered body parts all the more fun.\nIt was only a matter of time before\nthe wunder kind Michael Owen\nreleased a football game. Wee Mike\nis fronting World League Soccer\n2000 on the N64. The game has a full selection of international and\nclub players from the world's premier\nsquads. It also has a variety of\ngames from exhibition matches to\nleague and cup games. I'm not really into football games, but what\nmade this one stand out was its high\nquality of gameplay and the ease of\ncontrol. The thing that stopped me\nplaying football games was that the\ngameplay was frustrating and you\ncouldn't pass the ball where you\nintended. WLS 2000 changes all\nthat. The game is very fluid and easy\nto get into. You don't have to fiddle\nabout with any complicated con-tro ls; pulling off a bicycle kick could-n't be easier.\nAnd finally, can I just say that after\nplaying Rogue Spear multiplayer\npretty much continuously since our\nreview of it was published, its official Felix rating has gone up to a phenomenal five out of five - any\nserious PC gamer must buy Rogue\nSpear now!\nSo, aside from the gusset wetting graphics, atmospheric music and crotch\nhardening size, how does it compare to the master (Go/den eye)? Favourably\nis my opinion. Once the controls are mastered this stands as a ripping little\ngem.\nThe multiplayer option is a little weak, and has a last minute rush-job feeling\nabout it. The control system makes it hard to handle the character when up\nclose and personal. More interesting than multiplayer is the 'cooperative'\nmode. During the one player game, you can put together a robot named\nFloyd. When Floyd is complete, a second player can control Floyd and help\nout in the main game. Very cool. To complete the game, however, all the Tribals must be located which can become a little tiresome.\nThese problems will stop JFG progressing to cult status, however nobody would\nfeel hard done by if they spent their hard-earned cash on this little beauty. In\nfact (after Go/den eye and Zelda) this should be a must for any self-respecting\nN64 owner.\nChr\nIn addition to the slick gameplay,\nWLS 2000 contains some brilliant\nfootballing venues with sumptuous\nstadiums complete with cheering\ncrowd, billboards and big screen\nTVs. The graphics are top-notch,\nwhich just adds to the game's playa-bil it y. The players are solid and\nchunky, but have surprisingly fluid\nand realistic movements. The sound\nis quite good too but the commentators get a bit annoying (too real is tic).\nTo sum up, WLS 2000 is a highly\nplayable and enjoyable football\ngame. Well done fell as! ID Mark\n\n"

He is, however, in\nhis own words 'a funny kind of Englishman, a new breed... having\nemerged from two old histories' - those two histories being English and\nIndian.\nWe first meet Karim at the end of his education, when he is tired of\nschool, tired of the suburbs and tired of all the images imposed on him\nby other people. He is sure that as soon as he leaves school, grows up\nand finds a vocation things will be okay. But as Karim finally realises,\nadults are only people too.\nThis is a wonderfully written book - satirical and anarchic but still gen-u in e. Karim's bemuse ment at the antics of those around him are well\nconveyed by use of the first person. The book is more than just a social\ncomment. We can all emp a this e with Karim as he crosses the rocky\nboundary between child and adult and comes to terms with what he\ndiscovers on the other side. Karim is also a good candidate to tell us\nabout the lives of those around him because Karim is a drifter - with no\nreal purpose in his own life he avidly follows the lives of others, gets\nswept up in them and then dropped again. As the world around him\nchanges from the slow, hippy seventies to the fast-paced, materialistic\neighties Karim centres on his own family and friends and the ways in\nwhich they overcome obstacles to fulfil their dreams, and in some cases\nfind love.\nbooks =\n\u2022 ; He,;\nFree.'O: \u2022 \u2022 Tube; Wim l.,'V.

Ian gets apocalyptic.\nYour PC passed 9 / 9 / 9 9 without self-destructing.\n(Were you even aware that day last September was meant to be a crunch point in its short life?)\nCome next year, the millennium bug will have\nturned out to be just a minor blip. Maybe a plane\ndid drop out the sky, but who's to say it wouldn't have crashed anyway? However, the latest\nurban myth doing the rounds indicates that\nwhat you've really got to worry about is\nthe Y5G bug. This \"myth\" is based on/ better science than your average legend. Here's the facts...\nThe sun, our nearest main sequence star, is a great big H bomb. This bomb continuously releases copious jr Hi MI i.'i.i' l.n' I hydrogen nuclei are smashed together so violently that they fuse to form heavier isotopes of hydrogen and then he li um. So, should our sun, like a bomb, be blowing\nitself to bits? No. The sun keeps strong reins on its\nfuel. The immense mass of the sun means it has\nsimilarly immense gravity. The explosive force trying to spread the sun widely out into the solar system is balanced by its gravity, keeping it squished\nup in one place. This balance has held sway for\nall the time life on earth has known the sun and a long time before.\nHere's the (giga)bug. When our solar system\nwas created, the machine was given only a finite\namount of fuel. The sun is using over 3 million\ntonnes of its mass per second, converting it to\nenergy, including the heat and light we enjoy\n(from a safe distance) here on Earth. The point is,\nthere's a limit to the sun's fuel supplies. Thanks to\nthis lack of forward planning (with no re-fuelling\noperation contemplated) after 5 billion years\n(Y5G) the sun will have to fuse helium into heavier elements. The gravitational reins will become weaker. The sun will swell in size, cutting down on the 1 5 0 million-km separation of sun and earth. It\nII engulf Mercury. Earth will get hot. The relative cool of the Martian climate wil!\nbecome an attractive prospect for\n/'J' your holidays.\n\u00ab \u2122 W Government officials have identified several areas of concern in\nthe run up to Y5G, and propose\nto set up a task force (com-p rising un-elected freeload-k ers on generous expense\n) a< counts, and people J with no scientific background or understanding\nhat so ever) to endlessly debate Illustration: Luke Larrea\nvs issues such as\n\u2022 Should Jan1 st5000000000or Jan1 st5000000001 be the start of the new tail -lenni um? \u2022 The bil lenni um gnome construction project, a massive waste of public and private money.\n\u2022 The race to develop factor 3 6 0 0 0 sunscreen.\n\u2022 Why windows 4 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 \u2122 keeps crashing for no reason.\n\u2022 Imperial College building projects still not\ncomplete.\nOf course, eventually the sun will cool and contract, and what's left on Earth will freeze solid,\nincluding our atmosphere. But we won't be around to worry about that, because we're all\ngoing to die. It's been nice knowing you.\nThis isn't on the course but....\nNo. l: Maxwell' s Demon Maxwell's Demon was a sweet little creature who sorted out hot particles from cold ones. James Clerk Maxwell was not too pleased by his devilish creation because he\npracticed the mysterious art of \"Thermodynamics\" - watching gas in a box. From a layperson's perspective, there can't be an awful lot that is mysterious about gas in a box, one would expect it to just sit there. Nevertheless, a lot of physically important\ndiscoveries were made in the last century by gas-in-a box watchers. One such revelation was the principle of entropy: the 'messiness' of the universe is always increasing. This pri nci ple, more commonly know under the exuberant title of \"The 2 nd Law of Thermodynamics\", has quite\nprofound implications on the life and death of the universe. Closer to home, a good demonstration\nof this law can be achieved by observing your own bedroom( it works for me).\nReturning to our demonic friend, if (s) he's busy sorting out particles then the world won't be so messy, violating the entropy principle. Maxwell's Demon could play little tricks on people, sorting out\nthe fast particles from the slower ones, meaning that all the gas in a room could suddenly gather\nup in one corner... Scientists don't enjoy having their principles liberal is ed, so a solution to Maxwell's Demon became the goal of many gas-in-a box watchers. Unable to prove demons don't exist, the\nproblem was finally resolved by considering what happens to the poor little devil when (s) he's sorting particles. You see, although the particles will become less messy once they've been sorted, the\ndemon becomes messier - in fact, more messy than the original particles. Thus, the total messiness\nof the universe has increased and gas-in-a box watchers can rejoice in the validity of the 2 nd Law.\nThe same applies to bedrooms by the way, which explains the state of mine...
