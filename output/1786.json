    "content": "Due to the increasing number of Covid infections, including within the\nCollege, the Union has decided to take a number of steps to reduce\nthe risk of Covid impacting on our members and staff ahead of the\nChristmas break. This is particularly because close contacts of anyone\ninfected with the new variant, Omicron, are required to isolate for 10\ndays regardless of whether they have been vaccinated. This would\nimpact on people\u2019s plans to spend Christmas with family or friends, as\nwell as those who are travelling for their holidays.\n\u2022 We are postponing the \u201cStep into Christmas\u201d club night on 10\nDecember. We will get in touch directly with those who have\npurchased tickets to organise refunds.\n\u2022 Union staff will moved to working from home from Thursday\n9 December. Staff are still available to deal with your queries\nremotely.\n\u2022 We will work with clubs and societies to help them consider their\nown activities and how to minimise risk to those taking part in line\nwith College guidance. We will ensure the College is able to provide\nadvice and support in relation to these planned events.\n\u2022 Our shops on Sherfield Walkway will remain open until 15\nDecember, with online orders being fulfilled until 21 December.\n\u2022 Our bars will remain open until 18 December as planned. We\nwill continue to operate the bars as normal but are encouraging\ncustomers to remain seated and use the app to order, in order to\nreduce the risk of transmission.\n\u2022 Our Advice Centre will remain open until 17 December as planned,\noperating remotely.\n\u2022 Our Helpdesk will be open to Wednesday 15 December, but as\nthere will be less staff on site they may be busy and take a little\nlonger to help you.\n\u2022 The Union offices and building will close on 22 December until 4\nJanuary, as planned. Further information on opening dates and\ntimes will be on our website, in case you need to access or store\nequipment.\nWe understand that many students will have concerns, the measures\nwe are taking are to minimize potential risk of disruption to holiday\nplans, so everyone can have a safe and enjoyable break. They are not in\nresponse to any known cases of Omicron within the Union.\nWhat a term! It was incredible to see you roaming the campus again,\nhave fun in our bars and engage in all sorts of activities. We love having\nyou back and we can\u2019t wait for the new year to start. But first...let\u2019s all\nhave a well deserved break and recharge our bateries.\nWe know that many of you are staying in London over winter break,\nand for some this will be your first time away from home at Christmas.\nCollege has put together a number of events and resources to keep\nyou engaged and entertained over the next few weeks!\nCheck out their support page here: imperial.ac.uk/student-support-zone/support-during-covid-19/support-over-the-christmas-break.\nWe hope you all have a wonderful, restful winter break and you\u2019re take\ncare of yourselves.

Those more pro-restriction\nargue a whole swathe of reasons for\ngetting the jab. You\u2019re less likely to get\nthe virus at all. If you do get it, you\u2019re\nsignificantly less likely to be\nhospitalised by it. And\neven if you think you\u2019re\nyoung and healthy\nso it doesn\u2019t pose a\nthreat to you, the\nvaccine helps you\nprotect others who\nare more vulnerable.\nOn the hesistant side\nof the fence, arguments\nare far less diverse. Short\nof brazen conspiracy theory about\n5G chips, there is the incredibly\nsmall chance of a blood clot caused\n(far outweighed by the risks of\ncatching the actual virus) and the\ndogma that \u201cit\u2019s a personal choice\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a personal choice\u201d isn\u2019t a\nreason, it\u2019s a conclusion. \u201cBased on\nthese previously analysed factors, I\nhave concluded that the choice to take\nthevaccineisapersonaloneandshould\nnot be mandated by a government\u201d\nwould be a sensible concluding line,\nif there were factors to be analysed.\nBut as far as I\u2019ve seen, there aren\u2019t,\nit\u2019s just libertarian instinct telling\nsome people that they shouldn\u2019t be\nmade to do something, even if that\nchoice may cost the lives of others.\nImaginethatargumentcomingfrom\nthe other side of the fence.

Austria\nbegan plans for mandatory\nvaccines in November and\nriots ensued. Germany\u2019s\nbrand new Chancellor Olaf\nScholtz has announced as\none of his first actions in\noffice that vaccines will\nbecome mandatory in the\ncountry. Greece will have\na vaccine mandate for\nthose over 60 from January.\nIt seems that both of these options\nare as unpalatable as the other.\nPlan B includes restrictions that\nhave minimal effect on livelihoods but\nmay help stem the spread of infection.\nMasks for indoor public spaces, work\nfrom home if you can but come to\nwork if not, and crucially bars, pubs\nand restaurants can all remain open.\nIt looks like this might be it ever\nwinter from now on. People argue\nthat we never did this stuff in a bad\nFlu season, where 40,000 or so\npeople can die in a year, but maybe\nwe should have.

Filmed over the course of 5 years, this incredibly moving film being Fairweathers\u2019 feature film shines light on the struggles\nand hardship one in three women in Turkey have to go through. As an audience we follow the journey of lawyer Ipek Bozkurt as she fights for justice to be done. Here is\nthe conversation we had before she headed to a London screening where she spoke about what the filming of the feature was like:\nEva Borras Film Editor\nI had the opportunity to watch your feature film \u2018Dying to Divorce\u2019 and as a first\nquestion, how did you get involved with\nthis project and how was the process before\nstarting filming?\nIwasinTurkeyandIwasworkingwithajournalistona\ncompletely different subject. She was aware of the work\nof these activists, we were discussing it and as I was\nthere in Turkey we decided to contact the activists and\nmeet up with them and completely unexpected really,\ndecided to film one of the activists meeting Arzu (the\nwoman who has her arms and legs shot by her husband\nwhen she tries to leave him). We were more shocked\nby the meeting than we could ever\nhave been prepared for. One of\nthe important things I think was\nvery powerful was the shock of\nthe extremity of the violence,\nbut also Arzus\u2019 real strength of\ncharacter and that she had so\nmuchthatshewantedtosayabout\nthe situation. You know, how it\nhappened, why it happened - she\nhad so many insights that she\nreally wanted to share and it felt\nthat there wasn\u2019t a platform for\nher to be able to speak. I guess\nthat was the seed of it really, as I\nfelt like I was holding this urgent\nstory in my hands and I have to do something with it.\nIt really started from there, bit by bit, one thing led\nto another and I started discussing the idea with the\nproducer Sinead Kirwan and through the activists I\nmet Ipek, who\u2019s their lawyer. I just thought she was a\nreally great character and importantly, I really felt that\nshe could bring people into the situation in Turkey.\nYet also giving an understanding into the broader issue\nof domestic violence, femicide and misogyny - which\nare global issues and challenges that unfortunately no\nsociety escapes.\nSo do you feel like the aim of the documen-tary, as a director, was to give strength to\nsurvivors or more like show the reality of\ndomestic abuse survivors to the people that\nare not aware of this? What was your take\non it?\nI think I wanted it to be something that could generate a conversation - be it survivors being encouraged to\nspeak and share their stories or people who don\u2019t know\nabout the situation or people who are able to see their\nown societies in some way reflected in the issues raised\nin the film. I think even in the UK domestic violence\nis bad, not to the level of Turkey but there are femi-cides and problems with the level\nof misogyny, sexual violence not\nreallybeingprosecutedenough.I\nfeel like there are lots of different\nthings that people can take and\nmy job was to lay it out from the\npoint of view of the women as\nmuch as possible. Therefore al-lowingittounfoldsothatpeople\ncould experience it and connect\nto it in many different ways.\nDying to Divorce has\nbeen released along with\nthe United Nations campaign \u201c16 Days of Activism\u201d against domestic violence and was a\nvery hard piece to watch. How were the reactions of people when you screened it once\nit finished? For me I had to sit in silence digesting what I had just watched.\nYes, I think it is emotional for people and there\u2019s lots\nof layers in the film so there is a lot to take in. We, in\nfact, worked with a psychologist for the screenings\nthat we do in Turkey because we know that the rates\nof domestic abuse are so high that a lot of people in\nthe audience could be directly affected. So as well for\nthe screenings in London, before we start our question\nand answer, we gave people a moment and we tried to\nrecognise it and in doing so, bring out into the open\nthat you could feel that way.\nDefinitely, it is a film very needed with the\nnews going on right now. I wanted to also\nask you, Dying to Divorce was filmed over\nthe course of 5 years, what was that like?\nSince it's such a long time to be filming, did\nyou always know when it was going to end,\nwas there a timeline for the project?\nWell, I mean, it was very much an unfolding story.\nWhen I first joined the story, the activists were facing\nhuge issues of domestic abuse in the country but they\nwere really fighting back and were changing laws - so\nit was a really positive story. Then 2016 happened and\nthere was the attempted coup and then thousands of\npeople were arrested. The whole story just shifted dra-matically, and amidst the chaos of all of that, you could\nseethatwomen'srightswerechippedawaybitbybit.So\nthe story was just changing all the time and we could\nnever have predicted the political events or how they\nwould shape the story. Even the two stories themselves,\nwe could not know how they would unfold, so it was\nvery much following it and responding. In terms of being able to make it, this was very much an independent\nfilm and I was always working full time on other documentaries - this was something I was fitting in between\nprojects, or during holidays or weekends. So it had a\ntotal alternative way of making the film, it was manageable but a bit crazy. We managed to raise money per\nshoot, as the story became more clear and the end was\nin sight, things were settling somewhat and we were\nable to get funding to complete the post production.\nAlong with that, what were the challenges\nof making the film? As the theme is a current affair, did you ever feel like you might\nnot be able to publish this material?\nWell, yes. I think in terms of the cases, the justice they\nwere able to get was a big deal. So, in Kubras case (the\nwoman who was hit on the head by her husband and\n\u201c\nI WANTED IT TO BE\nSOMETHING THAT\nCOULD GENERATE A\nCONVERSATION - BE\nIT SURVIVORS BEING\nENCOURAGED TO\nSPEAK AND SHARE\nTHEIR STORIES\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n31\nCOMMENT\nSign the Open Letter\nDear College Leaders,\nIt is with great concern that we, the undersigned, are writing to you in order to ask Imperial College London to take a stand and ensure that the society we live\nin is one in which human life is valued \u2013 not quantified. We write to you to express our deep apprehension with regards to the role of Imperial in furthering the development of lethal autonomous weapons (LAWs) systems, also known as \u201ckiller robots\u201d.\nImperial is considered a world-class research university that has as one of its main missions to benefit society through excellence in science, engineering, medicine\nand business. Moreover, in its 2020-2025 Strategy, it was stated that the institution would be focusing on \u201cfinding appropriate partners and establishing valuable and\nimpactful collaborations\u201d and \u201cunderpin this through ethical principles of engagement.\u201d Imperial also highlighted as one of its main goals for the next years, the importance of \u201cfinding new ways to collaborate and to drive positive real-world outcomes.\u201d. Based on these goals established by Imperial, it is expected that the institution\nwill take a stand against the development of technologies that diminish the importance of human life by delegating the decision to take a life to a machine.\nThe lack of moral reasoning necessary to evaluate the proportionality of an attack, where human life is reduced to merely a factor within a predetermined computation is worrying. The Imperial College London also affirms in its official Strategy that it will \u201ccreate platforms for research, capacity-building and knowledge exchange\nto achieve social and economic goals, including tackling the UN Sustainable Development Goals\u201d. Therefore, it is important to emphasise that one of the 17 UN SDGs\nis the promotion of \u201cpeaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development\u201d and that the UN Secretary General has described the use of autonomous systems\nto take human life as \u201cmorally repugnant\u201d as a machine is incapable of exercising discretion, and lacks the compassion and empathy needed to make morally complex\ndecisions. Lethal autonomous weapons are incompatible with international human rights law, namely the Right to Life (\u2018no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of life\u2019),\nthe Right to a Remedy and Reparation, and the principle of human dignity.\nIt is of utmost importance that Imperial College London consider the risks of this lethal technology that is being developed with the aid of Imperial\u2019s research\ncentres. It is highly likely that, in the near future, autonomous weapons will expand into public life, beyond war zones. Autonomous weapons could be used for border control, policing, and upholding oppressive structures and regimes. Therefore, besides loss of meaningful human control, algorithmic biases and the inability of\nexplaining the reasoning behind an automated decision will put not only men of colour, of \u2018military age\u2019 in danger but also civilian groups of people of colour, women\nand non-binary people. Both manners of mistakes compound structural biases.\nAn investigation conducted by the Stop Killer Robots campaign has found that the Imperial College London is contributing to the development of lethal autonomous weapons through military-funded research collaborations, close relationships with commercial LAWs developers, and through the encouragement of student\nrecruitment to LAWs developers. Findings of particular concern include multiple ongoing projects developing LAWs technologies, partnered with the defence industry and its collaborators. Projects based in Centres for Doctoral Training and other laboratories at Imperial are developing sensor technologies and Unmanned Aerial\nVehicles (UAVs) in collaboration with well-known LAWs companies such as BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce.\nThese activities amount to the active endorsement of lethal autonomous weapons systems by Imperial College London, demonstrating a complete disregard for\nhuman rights and dignity. We urge College to take substantial action to prevent the further advancement of lethal autonomous weapons capabilities. We therefore call\nupon Imperial to:\n1. Cease all activities directly contributing to the development of lethal autonomous weapons. The College must release a statement acknowledging the\nharms it has enabled through its research activities into LAWs technologies, committing to no further activities contributing to the development of\nLAWs. This must be established in formal policy.\n2. Cease the encouragement of student recruitment to LAWs developers. The University must not allow LAWs developers access to students for the purposes of recruitment, nor must it allow student engagement with LAWs developers through workshops, talks or research projects.\n3. Take proactive measures to ensure researchers and students are made aware of all possible applications of their research. Imperial must set out concrete\nplans to improve awareness around the potentially harmful uses of its members\u2019 research.\n4. Take proactive measures to safeguard against the unethical usage of its members\u2019 research output.\n5. Publicly endorse a ban on lethal autonomous weapons by signing the Future of Life Pledge. Found online by searching: Open Letter on Autonomous\nWeapons - Future of Life Institute\nMore than 30 countries in the United Nations have explicitly endorsed the call for a ban on lethal autonomous weapons systems.\nNow is a timely moment for UK institutions to show support for this ban and urge the UK government to do the same. We demand Imperial College London accepts its responsibility for the role it has played in the development of lethal autonomous weap-ons, and instead use its influence to affect positive change with respect to human rights and dignity.\nIf you want to learn more or take further action, here are some options:\n\u2022 Share this open letter across Imperial via emails/social media/word of mouth\n\u2022 Attend an online CSKR workshop ran by CSKR campaigner Mariana Canto on Wednesday 15th December, sign up at\nthe following Eventbrite link: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hasta-la-vista-humanity-am-i-developing-killer-robots-tick-ets-217733024337\n\u2022 Sign the Autonomous Weapons Pledge by the Future of Life Institute linked in the QR Code to the right\n\n"

Greed. Legacy. Betrayal. Murder? The\nstory of the Gucci family is as outrageous as it is\nseductive, so it comes as no surprise that Ridley Scott\u2019s\nfilm adaptation incites the same feelings. The biopic\ntakes place across the latter quarter of the 20th century and follows Patrizia Reggiani\u2019s ambition of marrying into the famous family and its ultimate downfall.\nDubbed \u201cThe Black Widow\u201d by the Italian press\nback in the 90\u2019s, Reggiani (played by Lady Gaga) grew\nup poor in the town of Vignola and climbed up the\nsocial ladder after meeting Maurizio Gucci (Adam\nDriver) in the Milan party scene. The unlikely pair\nhit it off and wed in 1972, much to the dismay of\nthe groom\u2019s father, Rodolfo Gucci (Jeremy Irons). As\nReggianigottotastemoreandmoreoftherichlife,her\ngreed grew to a boiling point, persuading her husband\nto deceit and betray the other members of the family:\nuncle Aldo (Al Pacino) and cousin Paolo (Jared Leto).\nEgos crash, secrets are uncovered, and the glamourous\nGucci clan collapses under its own weight.\nAt just under 160 minutes, House of Gucci needs to\npack two decades worth of drama and character arcs.\nThe pace never feels slow or drawn-out, and viewers\nfind themselves wanting more and more of the alluring\nintrigues wrapped in fine Italian leather. The writing is\ncharming, with dialogue that feels natural \u2013 sometimes\nso much that you yourself can feel Rodolfo\u2019s secondhand embarrassment upon meeting Patrizia for the\nfirst time.\nFor me, the star of the production crew was not only\ndirector Ridley Scott, but also Polish cinematographer\nDariusz Wolski. His beautiful shots and play with\nlight juxtapose the main pair\u2019s inner emotions: from\nthe soft Italian sunshine in the church where they get\nmarried, to the sharp shadows on Maurizio\u2019s face as\nhe transforms from brainy lawyer-to-be into ruthless\nleader of the fashion empire.\nAdam Driver does an excellent job of playing this\ncharacter and the subtleties of his personality. He starts\noff shy, an opposite to Gaga\u2019s loud and frivolous young\nPatrizia. By the time he ascends to the top of the family\nhierarchy, the understated regret in Driver\u2019s eyes shows\nhe has lost his innocence. His Italian accent is not\nthe worst, especially when compared to his on-screen\nfather, Jeremy Irons. Despite his amazing portrayal\nof Rodolfo, Irons just cannot seem to shake off his\nBritishness.\nOn the other side of the accent spectrum lies the\nfemale lead, of Italian descent herself. Gaga truly\ncements her title as actress with this performance,\ninterpreting a multifaceted woman seduced by the\npromise of success and pushed over her tipping point.\nSheistender,sly,ferocious,dreamy,andabsolutelymad\nall at once. Gracing the cover of the December issue of\nVogue, Lady Gaga opened up about her performance\nand the mental toll of shooting the film. \u201cI lived as her\n[Reggiani] for a year and a half. And I spoke with an\naccent for nine months of that\u201d, she says, describing\nhow this was not limited to the set, but off-camera,\ntoo. But Gaga is not the only one partial to method\nacting: a veteran of the technique, Jared Leto goes\nabove and beyond (way, way beyond) with embodying\nhis character.\nHis role as Paolo, the black sheep of the family,\nis equal parts hilarious and cringeworthy. The\noverexaggerated Italian accent makes him look like a\ncaricature of the peculiar fashion designer. Whether\nit was the screenplay or Leto\u2019s own improvisations, his\nfrequentuseof \u201cAmericanisms\u201dtakesviewersoutofthe\nfantasyalittle.Regardless,youcannothelpbutchuckle\nwhen he is on screen. Last but not least, Al Pacino does\na great job of playing Paolo\u2019s father and chairman of\nGucci (but what else would you expect). The ease with\nwhich he acts is simply wonderful to watch.\nThe film is aided by gorgeous scenery: Duomo di\nMilano, the ski slopes in St Moritz, the lush villas on\nthe Como lakeside. Although the story is completely\nreal, House of Gucci feels almost escapist, with its\nscandalous plots and luxurious settings. It beats Ridley\nScott\u2019s other rich family drama, All the Money in the\nWorld, and definitely deserves a watch.\nTelevision\nMarvel Landing a Bullseye\nThenewestadditiontotheMCU,\u2018Hawkeye\u2019,isnot\nnew in all respects. Following in the footsteps of\nthis summer\u2019s \u2018Black Widow\u2019 it dives into a personal\nadventure of one of the six original Avengers, however,\ninstead of delving into the past, it picks up where\nEndgame left off. Clint Barton makes his comeback\nas a more authentic and pensive, albeit aged and\nbattle-worn, version of himself, and Jeremy Renner\u2019s\nperformance doesn\u2019t disappoint.\nKnown for films such as \u2018Pitch Perfect 2\u2019 and \u2018Edge\nof Seventeen\u2019, Hailee Steinfeld, playing Kate Bishop,\nwho was inspired by Hawkeye to become an archer, is\nnot necessarily the actress one might expect to take on\nthe role, but as usual, Marvel\u2019s casting directors have\nhitthejackpot.Steinfeld\u2019syouthandenthusiasm,both\nasherselfandasBishop,contrastsnicelywithRenner\u2019s\nexperience while also giving him a much-needed shot\nof energy.\nRenner and Steinfeld have the kind of acting\nchemistry that was lacking in the recently released\n\u2018Eternals\u2019 film. They are given the licence to toy with\nlight-hearted comedy alongside heavier, more serious\nscenes; a balance that has long been a strength of the\nMCU films and their respective casts. The dramatic\nand comedic scenes are cleverly intertwined in a way\nthat allows them to flow into each other seamlessly,\nwithout being jarring.\nSetting the show against the backdrop of Christmas\nhasgivenitafestiveandhomelyfeel;orasmuchofone\nasaseriesaboutvigilantesandcrime-fightingcanhave.\nHawkeye has always been the most family-oriented of\nthe Avengers \u2013 by virtue of actually having one \u2013 and\nit is highlighted in these first few episodes, with Clint\ntorn between domestic duty and the thrills of fighting\ncrime. While leaning into the Christmas theme, it also\nmanages to showcase the grittier side of humanity,\nentering the world of mafias and street-level threats\n(the style of smaller city scuffles I personally would\nhave liked to see more of in the Shang-Chi film).\nThe show also plays with the concept of impostor\nsyndrome, and the burden that Clint bears, being\nthe only truly human Avenger left. Many of us know\nimpostor syndrome well \u2013 feeling out of place in a\nparticular group due to doubting our own level of skill\nor knowledge. Barton struggles with both the physical\nand mental ramifications of being on the original\nAvengers team, and the weight of this shows in his\nbrooding character. His inner battles have the capacity\nto garner lots of sympathy from viewers, whether\nyou\u2019readiehardHawkeyefanornot,andhischildren\u2019s\nwishes for his return for the holidays make it all the\nmore poignant.\nThere is potential for Yelena to show up at some\npoint, following the target placed on Barton in the\nend-credits of Black Widow, but so far there have\nbeen no explicit clues or mentions of her. Perhaps\nsomething to look out for later in the show?\nFor now, Clint is being given space to live out his\nown story; for us to see him as an individual hero as\nwell as a team player. \u2018Hawkeye\u2019 has hit the ground\nrunning, as its namesake often does literally, and we\u2019re\nlooking forward to seeing where it goes next.\nZanna Buckland Books Editor\n\n"

    "content": "The premise of POLICE COPS: The Musical is\neverything I have ever wanted in a musical pro-duction: surreal enough to satiate my desire for the in-sane, yet witty and clever in a very practiced and well-tuned way. The production dives straight into a scene\nthat could easily have been pulled from an out-dated\npolice instructional video, and we are quickly introduced to the multi-talented cast as they quick change\nand dart on and off set: returning as an array of wacky,\nconfusing, and hilarious characters. Following the plot\nof pretty much any disaster movie that has ever been\nshown on the silver screen, the show was hardly original but unlike anything I have seen before in the theatre world: and it worked! POLICE COPS was probably the most I\u2019ve laughed all year \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t\nmake it perfect.\nLet\u2019s start with the cast. Our three main police cops\n(played by Zachary Hunt, Tom Roe, and Nathan Parkinson) took to their roles with vigour. Barely keeping\ntheir clothes on for much of the performance, they\nretained a huge amount of energy throughout and\ndelivered killer line after killer line. You can really feel\nthat these three actors have been doing this a long time\nand have the humour down. The stand-out for me was\nour main man Zack (Zachary Hunt): dealing with an\nimpressive number of gaffs (including the complete\ndecomposition of his costume on stage) he somehow\nkept it all together and in character. If anything Parkinson seemed the most out of place: playing the enigmatic and predatory chief-of-police, he felt slightly out of\nsync with the rest of the cast throughout the first half.\nSupporting the main cast were the wonderful and\nvaried Miztil Rose and Andrea Nodroum. Often these\ncharacters would have to bring the humour to a new\nscene in just a few lines, or even none at all. Nodroum\nas the exiled ex-chief-of-police was a perfect cast: from\nher peculiar love interests, to her mysterious exile to\na Mexican orphanage \u2014 what a ride. Similarly, Rose\nmanages to convey so much character merely in the\nway she pours coffee or sits on the edge of a scene.\nSo then, if these are such funny and well-practised\nperformers, where did it all go wrong? For me, there\nwas not enough investment in the theatre-making or\nthelibrettoandnarrative.Inashowwithsomanyquick\nchanges you can forgive the odd wardrobe malfunc-tion; yet, frequently, I was seeing off-stage characters\nstripping off backstage as the stage door banged open\nby mistake. Not to mention that, after my initial shock\nat the quality of the original music, I was disappointed\nto see that same libretto repeated over and over again\nthroughout. There is something really special about\nthis performance and it felt almost squandered.\nPOLICE COPS was a night I will not forget quick-ly. It left me satisfied and smiling, having laughed harder than I have in a long time. But as a piece of theatre,\nno matter how satirical or on-theme, it failed to deliver\non some key aspects.\nIf you\u2019re short on something to do, this is a great\nshow to head to with your mates: especially if they\u2019re\npartial to some semi-naked mildly homo-erotic 80s\ncop movie action!\nIt would be criminal to not love this show\u2026\nso lock me up!\nReviewed by Alex Jackson Arts Editor\nPOLICE COPS: The Musical\nWhere?

Its aim?\nTo show how the Ancient Greeks saw\nscience and wisdom and how they applied it to many aspects of their society\nincluding travel, astronomy, time, music\nand even body shape.\nEntering the exhibition, you are\ngreeted with a video projected onto a\nsarcophagus panel depicting the nine\nMuses to highlight the importance the\nancient Greeks placed on intelligence\nand culture. The Muses were goddesses of literature, science and art; the\nword museum comes from the Greek\n\u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd (mouseion), meaning \u201cseat of\nthe Muses\u201d.\nAlthough they had very little of the\ntechnology we have today , they developed their own incredibly advanced\nsystems governing many aspects of life.\nThis breadth of application is demonstrated in the wide range of topics covered during a small walk around a large\nU-shaped room. The first half focuses\non their advanced naval architecture\nand Aristotle\u2019s Taxonomy. It then loops\naround to a brief dive into the influence\nof mathematics on athletics, including\nhow it was used to calculate the measurements of the \u201cideal body shape\u201d. They\nwould start with the dimensions of a\njoint in the little finger, multiplying it to\nachieve all the proportions\nrequired for a statue. The exhibition informs us that\nthe ancient Greeks\nsaw these prop o r t i o n s\nas being\nperson-i f i e d\nin the\nv i c -t o r s\no f\ntheir\n\u201cPanhellenic\nGames\u201d.\nT h e s e\ngames were\na set of four\nsports festivals\nto honour the\nGreek gods and\nmark time. The Olympic Games were\namongst them.\nThe exhibition continues with two\nmain exhibits: Music, and Astronomy\n& Time.\nPythagoras believed that everything\ncould be explained by mathematics,\neven the beauty of music \u2013 he and his\nfollowers applied this logic to the au-los (pictured) design. The aulos was an\nancient Greek instrument, consisting\nof two pipes. Musicians would play by\nblowing into both pipes simultaneously and placing\ntheir fingers over the\nholes. The spacing\nof the holes\ndetermined\nthe notes\nb e i n g\nplayed.\nP y -thag-o r a s\ninvest i -g a t e d\nt h e s e\nspacings\nmathematically , finding\nthat the most\nharmon ious\nnotes were created by simple\nratios (4:3, 3:2, 2:1). This is demonstrated by an interactive screen reproducing\nthe sounds an aulos makes when different holes are covered, along with explanatory videos of how the sound is created,\nand a genuine Aulos on loan from the\nMus\u00e9e du Louvre in Paris.\nThe final, and possibly largest, part of\nthe exhibition focuses on Astronomy &\nTime. The Greeks believed that mathematics connected all the disparate parts\nof the universe. The exhibition informs\nus that the word cosmos comes from the\nGreek \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 (kosmos), which means\n\u201corder\u201d. This section includes the sec-ond-oldest geared mechanical calendar\nin the world (centre of page, and be-low). The device is speculated to have\nbeen based on designs by the Greek pol-ymath, Archimedes. It could be used to\naccurately predict the positions of the\nSun and Moon in the Zodiac and Lunar\nphases to assign dates for religious fes-tivals. It also included a list of latitudes\nfor use in 16 different locations, from\nConstantinople through to Athens and\nRome.\nThe exhibition is a beautiful and respectful ode to the Ancient Greeks and\ntheir achievements, many of which are\nfoundational to modern-day Western\nsociety. It whets your appetite leaving\nyou wanting to go away and read even\nmore about the Ancient Greeks.

    "content": "The current traffic light system on\nfood packaging is essentially a\nnationwide marketing strategy for a set\nof predefined nutritional benchmarks.\nIt reeks of the UK nudge movement\nthat looks to shift consumer behaviour\nwithout explicit enforcement or\nrestrictions. Instead, nudge tactics\npredictably shift behaviour without\ncompromising consumer choice. The\ntheory is that people can still choose\nbetween the red and green options,\neven if their subconscious tendency is\ntowards the green. They have an illusion\nof choice.\nThere has been a growing call for\nsimilar labelling for the environmental\nimpact of the food we buy, alongside\nother goods. I don\u2019t need to spell out\nthe supposed benefits of such a scheme.\nThe Carbon Trust have been looking to\ndevelop a recognised verification system\nthat incorporates various brackets of\nCO2 use, such as a \u2018reducing CO2\u2019\nlabel or a \u2018carbon neutral\u2019 measure. Here\nwe run into the first problem\u2014these\nmetrics are incredibly complex and\nstruggle to be channelled into a PhD\nthesis, let alone a solitary label.\nWhatforexampledoesreducing CO2\nmean? If you go onto the Carbon Trust\u2019s\nwebsite it makes this a bit clearer, but\nif you\u2019re a fatigued consumer hurrying\nthrough a food shop to get home after\nwork, then you don\u2019t really want to take\nthe time to work out what it all means.\nYou also have the problem of the\nsheer quantity of environmental and\nsocial factors that go into each product.\nIf you try to incorporate everything,\nthen packaging will have to have a\ncompendium attached to cover every\nvariable; key metrics have to be chosen.\nFor example, carbon footprint seems\nto be the main area of current focus.\nIs this a metric decisive enough to\nsway consumer behaviour? Should the\ncarbon footprint of a good transfer\nyour purchasing decision away from\nthe ethically sourced to the unethically\nsourced?\nWe also need to remember that the\nexistence of labels are reflexive with\nproducers, meaning their existence also\nimpacts what producers focus on. For\nexample, a Diet Coke has all green boxes\non the nutritional traffic light system,\nwhereas a pack of almonds has a red box\nfor the fat content, even though such\nthings as healthy fats exist. Labelling\nwill always be simple enough for the\nproducer to game. Whatever is the focus\nof the producer will become the focus of\nthe labelling, perhaps to the detriment\nof more uniquely important issues. For\nexample, in parts of the world where\nwater scarcity is an issue, this may be\nweighted of higher importance than the\ncarbon footprint, but the producer may\nchoose to focus on reducing the carbon\nfootprint instead as they know this acts\nas a better market signal of superiority.\nSo in response to this, should we\nhave a series of labels each representing\ndifferent environmental variables\nrelating to such things as greenhouse\ngas emissions, water-use, human welfare\nin production? To mirror the array of\nnutritional groups there could also be\nan array of environmental variables;\nperhaps traffic-lighted as well. But again,\na standardised metric doesn\u2019t take into\naccount the relative importance of each\nvariable across geographies. A bit like\nthe idea that not all calories are created\nequal.\nWe also have to consider the\ncomplications accounting each metric.\nFor nutritional brackets this is easier, as\nyouaredealingwithastaticproductthat\ncan be analysed in a lab. But with carbon\nfootprint tracking, there are so many\nvariables in the whole supply chain that\na supposedly accurate measurement\ncan at best be indicative rather\nthan quantifiable. Working out the\nenvironmental impact of a good is just a\nlot more complicated than working out\nthe nutrition breakdown of food.\nThemetricsthattheCarbonTrustseek\ntomeasurearerelativelyuncontroversial,\nit is the methods of calculation that are.\nMostwillagreeahighCarbonFootprint\nis bad, but it is the way this is calculated\nthat is controversial. The nutritional\nmeasurements have the opposite effect,\nrunning us into problems such as:\nshould we be saying high calories are bad\nandlowcaloriesaregoodjustbecausewe\ncan measure how many there are?\nThe danger in trying to refine the\nenvironmental impact of a good is that it\ncauses an informational overload for the\nconsumer. We end up with a derivative\nof the paradox of choice, where we are so\noverburdened by combinations of labels\nthat we struggle to choose anything at\nall. The modern person is after all, rather\ntime poor.\nIn spiteofthe many flaws,thequestion\nthat remains is whether it is better than\nno information for the consumer. Will\nwe get a result where the presence of\nboth nutritional and environmental\nlabelling in fact diminishes the efficacy\nof each of them? For example, does a\ncarbon neutral label deter people from\nlooking at the nutritional label?\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that we do\nalready have the organic and origin\ncountrylabellingonsomefoods.Perhaps\nthough, the success of these two\nfeatures is precisely because people tend\nnot to think of them as environmental\nindicators; they also think of them for\ntheir second-order effects of healthier\nfood or supporting the domestic\neconomy.\nClearly there is a need for the\nconsumer awareness of the impact of\nwhat they are buying and eating, but can\nthecomplexityofthisbefairlyarticulated\nin a series of traffic-light labels? Global\nsupply chains are incredibly complex,\nso good luck to anyone charged with\naccurately quantifying the true impact\nofourfood.Perhapsthebestwecanhope\nfor is that the whole exercise makes the\nconsumer think of the impact of what\nthey eat, rather than take any labelling as\ngospel truth.\nEnvironmental labelling on\nfood - productive or destructive?\nEnvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nSeb Lawson Environment Writer\nSHOULD THE CARBON\nFOOTPRINT OF A\nGOOD TRANSFER YOUR\nPURCHASING DECISION\nAWAY FROM THE ETHICALLY\nSOURCED TO THE\nUNETHICALLY SOURCED?\n\u201c\nWhat determines your purchase decisions?\nEnvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nFRIDAY 10TH DECEMBER 2021\n15\nEdited by: Monami Miyamoto\nMarie Mori\nJack Cribb\nEnvironment View online here!\nPhoto credits: titovailona, Envato Elements\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 10TH DECEMBER 2021\n14\nARTS\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nFamily Room is a new play by Annabel Knight performed at the Union Concert Hall by our very own\nDramSoc. The story follows the happenings in a hospi-talwaitingroomaseightcharactersliveoutsomeofthe\nmost anxious and heart-wrenching moments of their\nlives. We predominantly follow the conversations between a young pair: a hospital volunteer who recently\nlost her sister, and the older brother of a girl currently\nhaving treatment. These two are supported by a varied\ncast, each with their own dramas and tragedies unfolding around them \u2013 a road traffic accident, cancer, alco-holism. However, it is the dynamic between our two\ncentral character that drives us through the narrative. I\nwanted to know how it all worked out for them. They\nboth convey a great deal of pain in their dialogue and,\nthough it barely reaches the surface, there is a slight\nwill-they-won\u2019t-they frisson between the pair. Young\nand awkward, it is easy to see oneself in either of the\nduo.\nThe overall production quality of Family Room is\nsecond-to-none.Thesetdesigniscraftedextremelywell\n-- the walls are painted in sickly shades that can only\never be found in medical facilities; and, of course, there\nare only PG Tips on offer for cups of tea. When paired\nwith the expert lighting, the space is transformed into\na multi-layered hospital setting: with the area in front\nof the stage being used to particularly good effect. It is\na testament to the writing that the blackouts and set\nchanges were handled so elegantly; and the use of music for changing the context worked well for the most\npart.\nWhat did not work so well for me was the direction\ntheplotheadedin.Fromtheget-go,thiswasaplaycon-cerned with reality. It felt as though it aimed to capture\nthe calamity and tragedy that occurs silently and malignantly in the waiting rooms of hospitals. So then,\nit felt rather gimmicky to include multiple last-min-ute twists, in the context of what had until then been\npoignant and authentic dialogue. Indeed, where future\nevents were foreshadowed, this seemed to be overem-phasised and ultimately took the bite out of the final\nmoments of the play.\nAll in all, Family Room packs a punch in a short\nspace of time. The writing clearly comes from an authentic place and, when delivered by the wonderful\ncast of the Imperial Dramatic Society, you will find little to complain about.\nThe show, however, is only as strong as its lead actor,\nwho needs to sell questionable choices and behaviour\nto the audience. Connor Curran who plays Christopher (and is the first neurodiverse actor to play this\nneurodiverse character) delivers on this promise. His\nportrayal of Christopher is simply magnetic, allowing\nthe audience to not only deeply sympathise with him,\nbut to also root for him. An electrifying performance\nby Rebecca Root who portrays Siobhan, Connor\u2019s\nteacher, also contributes to this. Root delivers her performance with intense emotional agility, making her\ncharacter\u2019s conversations with Curran\u2019s Christopher\nhit all that much harder.\nIn addition to the remarkable acting, the play is\nstaged marvellously. Marianne Elliott, known for directing some of the most acclaimed production of this\ncentury including War Horse (a personal favourite),\nCompany (another favourite), Angels in America and\nDeath of a Salesman strikes once again, and does not\nhold back. A Curious incident is continuously visually striking in a way that complements the text without\ndistracting the audience. It mirrors Christopher\u2019s emotional turmoil and reflects it unto the audience. I am\nnotusuallyabigfanofprojectionsonstageastheytend\nto be a bit of a cop out, but here they are anything but.\nThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\nis an iconic piece of British theatre that has proven\nthroughout its decade-long existence that it is here to\nstay that way.\nIntense and poignant tales from the Family Room\nReviewed by Alex Jackson Arts Editor\nFamily Room\nWhere?

    "content": "Last week two Imperial College\nprofessors were appointed to senior\npositions in the Royal Society and on\nthe Budget Responsibility Committee.\nProfessor David Miles was appointed,\nas the economic expert, to the\nthree-person Budget Responsibility\nCommittee by Chancellor\nRishi Sunak on December 3rd.\nThe role, described as \u201cone of the\nnation\u2019smostinfluentialeconomicpolicy\njobs\u201d by Bloomberg, involves economic\nforecasting for the UK and overseeing\nthe Office for Budget Responsibility.\nMiles\u2019 work with help determine the\namount of money available to the\nChancellor when setting the national\nbudget, as well as determining how\nmuch taxes may need to increase.\nProfessor Miles will become the\n\u201cresidentmacroeconomicexpert,making\nthe big judgments on growth, inflation,\nunemployment and productivity\u201d.\nOn the appointment, Miles said \u201cI\nam delighted to accept this nomination\nand hope to contribute to the important\nwork the OBR is undertaking. The\nUK\u2019s fiscal position is challenging as\nthe economy has been buffeted by\nexceptional shocks - the work of the\nOBR has never been more important.\u201d\nThe Dean of Imperial College\nBusiness School said \u201cDavid is one\nof the UK\u2019s leading economists and\nwill bring a wealth of knowledge and\nexperience to this important role\u201d.\nProfessor Miles was a member of the\nBank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy\nCommittee from 2009 until 2015.\nDavid Miles has written two cost\nbenefitanalysesoflockdowns,comparing\nhealth benefits to economic damage.\nA paper on which Miles was the\nlead author, published in August 2020,\nconcluded that \u201cthe costs of continuing\nsevere restrictions are so great relative to\nlikely benefits in lives saved that a rapid\neasing in restrictions is now warranted\u201d.\nA second paper, published just\ntwo weeks previously, came to the\nsimilar conclusion that \u201cthe costs\nof continuing severe restrictions in\nthe UK are large relative to likely\nbenefits so that a substantial easing\nin general restrictions in favour of\nmore targeted measures is warranted\u201d.\nA March 2021 paper, assessing the\nrate of easing of restrictions in the\nUK, suggested that \u201ca somewhat faster\neasing of restrictions in England than\ncurrent policy implies\u201d is favourable.\nEven more topical, Miles recently coauthored an article in the FT assessing\nthe disagreement between Universities\nUK and the University and College\nUnion over the USS pension scheme\npolicy. Conclusions, were that the\nUSS most likely has strong enough\nassets to support pre-existing pension\npromises, but that there is as high as\na 40% risk that universities would be\nleft with liability of over \u00a320 billion\nto pension holders, in the event that\nfund assets run out before 2055.\nMiles will take over the role\nfrom incumbent Professor Sir\nCharlie Bean in January 2022.\nProfessor Robin Grimes was\nappointed to the role of Foreign\nSecretary of the Royal Society, one of\nthe five most senior positions on the\nSociety\u2019s council.

And in the end, although he never served any jail\ntime and he had his sentence greatly reduced, he was\ncharged with hitting her. This was very important not\nonly for the family, but also because it meant that it was\naccepted that he did hit her. That put us therefore in a\nstronger position to be able to tell that story fully be-causeitwasrecognisedbythecourt.Intermsofdistrib-uting the film, it is true that in Turkey the pressure not\nto speak out is very real, so we had to be careful when\ndistributing the film. Especially Ipek, she watched the\nfilmmanytimesandagreedwitheverythingsaidinitas\nit is her life\u2019s work and felt it was important to be brave\nand take that risk.\nI can completely understand where the\nchallenges are coming from. Moving on to\nyour film career, can I ask how and why did\nyou get into the filming documentaries in-dustry? Could you explain your journey as\na filmmaker?\nI did always have an interest in documentaries. I did a\ndrama degree at University in Bristol so we did some\nfilmmaking as part of the course and lots of theatre. I\nthink for me, documentaries gave me this opportunity\ntobeabletousethecraftofstorytellingtoreallyengage\npeople and have a real purpose. I started to feel like this\nwould be my medium for telling stories because I think\nbeing able to work directly with people would be sur-prising, unexpected and profound. I just felt a high level of motivation to learn about the human condition\n- and the insight of what people have to say about what\nit means to be alive. After I graduated, I got the opportunity to do a traineeship at the BBC which was a good\nopportunity to get experience on work and was really\nexciting to me was to also meet lot of people. Then at\nsome point I really felt that observational documentaries following unfolding stories was also even more of a\nfocus. I suppose I wanted to get really good at learning\nthe skills that would be needed for filming and how to\nbe in unfolding situations - I guess it also helped constantly telling people \u201cI want to direct\u201d and expressing\nmy interests.\nCongratulations on the feature being chosen as the UK documentary submission for\nthe Oscars prize award. How does it feel to\nget your work recognised?\nWe hope that it means more people can watch the\nfilm which is our main aim - it was really exciting in\nthat respect to feel the feature would be able to reach\nmore people. There was a slight joy, as this was a super\nlow budget production made in very challenging\ncircumstances. It\u2019s joyful for us and for the women\nin the film in particular that people are moved and\ninspired by their stories, hopefully we can get it out\nfurther.\nHonestly, I feel your career is so inspiring\nand I just wanted to ask one last question,\ncould you give us a glimpse of what is happening now for Chloe Fairweather, what\nare your future plans?\nI\u2019m working with the same producer about an idea for\nanother independent film, but I won\u2019t say too much\nabout it because it\u2019s still in development. We\u2019ll see what\nhappens with that, haha. In terms of television, I\u2019m\ndirecting with someone else a series as well as trying\nto create the space for my own ideas for stories I feel\nshould be told.\nDying to Divorce won the Jury Prize at Monte\nCarlo and The Amnesty International Prize at the\nThessaloniki Film Festival. The stories of Arzu\n(married off at 14 to her husband) and Kubra\n(former TV broadcaster) deserve to be seen. It has\nbeen in UK cinemas since the 26th of November\nso be sure to check it out!

It will be used for investigations in astrophysics, involved in observing the formation of the first galaxies,\nand characterising the atmospheres of\npossibly habitable exoplanets.\nThe JWST is being billed as a direct\nsuccessor to the Hubble Space Telescope, with some key changes and improvements to increase its scientific\nvalue. The primary mirror of the JWST\nhas a diameter 3 times that of Hubble,\nallowing it to capture significantly more\nlight, improving the quality of its im-ages. Unlike Hubble, which operated\nmostly in the visible and ultraviolet regions of the electromagnetic spectrum,\nthe JWST will focus on the infrared\nregion. This allows for the observation\nof older and colder objects than Hubble, and despite necessitating a complex\ncooling arrangement is one of the most\nexciting prospects of the telescope.\nThe European Space Agency\u2019s Ariane\n5 rocket will send the telescope into a\nspecial orbit, around what is known as\na Lagrange point. This is a distant point\n\u2013 approximately 1.5 million km from\nEarth \u2013 where gravitational forces from\nthe Earth and Sun are balanced. The orientation of the Earth and Sun relative to\nthe spacecraft are constant in this orbit,\nallowing for constant communication\nwhile keeping the instrumentation cool.\nThis remote orbit means that unlike\nHubble, there is no possibility of a repair\nmission to the JWST \u2013 everything must\ngo to plan on the first and only attempt.\nDespite being a NASA led project,\nthere has been significant international\ncollaboration on the JWST. Alongside\nthe launch vehicle, the European Space\nAgency has provided two of the four\nscientific instruments carried on board\nthe telescope, with the Canadian Space\nAgency providing an integral part of the\nguidance system and an imaging system.\nThe project has been plagued with\ndelays and budget overruns since it was\nfirst planned in the early 1990s. Originally named the Next Generation Space\nTelescope, it was commissioned during\nthe \u201cfaster, better, cheaper\u201d era of NASA\nadministration, with contracts awarded\nin 1997 and 1999 for design concepts\nandcostestimates.Theinitialplancalled\nfor a launch in 2007 with a total mission\nbudget of $500 million. The timeline\nand budget have continually made a\nmockery of this initial estimate, with the\nfirst design review in 2008 predicting a\nlaunch in 2014 with a total budget of\n$5.1 billion, and timelines and budgets\nhave continued to slip ever since.\nConstruction of the telescope was finally completed in 2016, with extensive\ntesting procedures being started soon\nafter. A practice deployment of the complex sunshield found tearing and insufficient tension in support cables, resulting\nin a full design review being conduct-ed. A report on its findings, released in\n2018, found that the JWST had 344 potential single point failures, all of which\ncould independently lead to the loss of\nthe programme. A revised launch date\nof May 2020 was announced to account\nfor the extra ground testing required,\nwith a further delay being caused due to\nthe pandemic. The telescope was finally\nshippedtothelaunchsiteinFrenchGui-ana in October 2021, where it was then\nintegrated onto the Ariane 5 launch ve-hicle.\n14 years late and more than $10 billion over budget, the James Webb Space\nTelescope is finally ready to take flight.\nJames Webb Space Telescope\nfinally set to launch\nShrey Bohra Staff Writer\nThe finally assembled JSWT\nThis week in Science...\nImperial-based battery tech startup raises \u00a31.5m in seed round\nKey step in bacteria gene sharing revealed\n3D imaging reveals never-before-seen muscles of ammonite fossil\nBreathe Battery Technologies, a startup founded in 2019 by Dr Ian Campbell\n(CEO) Dr Yan Zhao (CTO), and Professor Greg Offer (Chief Scientific Officer) has raised \u00a31.5m in funding to scale up and accelerate the deployment of\nits intelligent battery management algorithms in electric vehicles and smart-phones. Battery management systems play a critical role in enabling batteries\nto be used safely and to their fullest extent. Advances will help vehicles run for\nlonger and charge faster. Dr Campbell and Dr Zhao received their PhDs from\nImperial College, and were supervised by Professor Greg Offer. Speaking to\nthe College, Dr Rebeca Santamaria-Fernadez, IPC Director for the Faculty of\nEngineering, said, \u201cBreathe\u2019s advanced battery management techniques could\nsupport greater electrification and contribute to the transition to zero pollution.\u201d\nA team of researchers, including some from Imperial College London have\nused 3D imaging to visualise the soft tissue of a 165-million-year ammonite\nfossil, the first time this has been done. They observed hyponomes, which expelled jets of water to propel the now-extinct molluscs forwards, and strong\nmuscles which allowed them to retract into the safety of their shells when confronted by predators. Their work is evidence that squids, octopuses and cuttlefish may be closer to ammonites than was previously thought. The group\nused X-ray and neuron imaging to produce a detailed 3D computer model of\nthe rare Jurassic fossil, which enabled them to see the soft tissue inside. Dr\nAlan Spencer, Senior Strategic Teaching Fellow at the Department of Earth\nScience and Engineering, and co-author of the paper, said, \u201cThis is a major\nbreakthrough in ammonite palaeobiology.\u201d\nFROM IMPERIAL...\nFROM AROUND THE WORLD...\nLight-coloured feathers could help migrating birds stay cool\nHalf of the world\u2019s bird species are migratory. New research has suggested that\nthey have lighter feathers than their non-migratory relatives, which could be\nto help them stay cooler on long, exhausting flights. Migratory birds can overheat when putting themselves through the enormous physiological stress of\nflying long distances. Lighter colours absorb less heat than darker ones. The\nteam analysed over 20,000 illustrations of 10,618 bird species, and found a\nslight but consistent difference in the lightness of migratory bird feathers,\nwith the longest distance migrators around 4% lighter than non-migrators\nBacteria can exchange DNA by conjugation, including genes that have antimicrobial resistance. The details of conjugation mechanics have remained unknown for a long time, but a team of researchers from Imperial College London and Queen Mary University of London have now imaged a key part of\nthe process. They imaged the outer-membrane core complex of the type IV\nsecretion system (T4SS), which anchors the T4SS to the other bacterium. The\nT4SS can then send out a pilus that penetrates the bacterium and allows gene\ntransfer. They obtained the images using cryo-electron microscopy and found\nthe outer-membrane core complex is made of two concentric rings of proteins\nwith very flexible connectors.Dr Tiago Costa, a member of the team, and Lecturer in Bacterial Pathogenesis said, \u201cDeciphering the mechanistic details of\ngene transfer could provide us with targets that can be exploited to suppress\nantibiotic resistance\u201d. With this goal they hope to image the rest of the T4SS\nin E. coli.\nPhoto credits: Goddard Space Flight Centre\n\n"

    "content": "Nuclear energy is the second-largest\nsource of low-carbon electricity\nglobally, accounting for 10% of pro-duction. The Nuclear Energy Institute\nsummarises the process thus: \u201cNuclear\npower is generated by a controlled chain\nreaction inside a nuclear reactor, most\ncommonly in a process called nuclear\nfission. In fission, neutrons collide with\nuranium or plutonium atoms, causing\nthe atoms to split and release additional neutrons and energy in the form of\nheat. This heat is used to convert water\ninto steam, which drives turbines to\nproduce electricity.\u201d Rolls-Royce\u2019s SMR\ndesignhopestodisruptanddramatically\nchange the nuclear sector to bring nucle-araswellastheUKbacktotheforefront\nof the energy sector.\nThe SMR technology is primarily factory manufactured, through a UK-only\nsupply chain, with 90% of the module\nbuilt in factory conditions. The company claims that this design will deliver\n220\u2013440 MW of power supply, equivalent to 150 wind turbines. It can operate\nboth on or off-grid. The SMR modules\nare approximately 16m-by-4m, with the\npower station taking up 40,000 m2\n. The\nmodules will last up to 60 years before\ndecommissioning. Through deployment\nof this technology, Rolls-Royce aims to\nstep up as a UK low-cost and low-risk\nutility company by 2028. Their design\ntackles three key nuclear sector challeng-es:\nAffordable: With a supply chain manufacture model developed, these reactors will have a much lower cost than\nprevious \u201cbespoke\u201d nuclear reactor projects across the world.\nRepeatable: With 90% of the component manufactured through the supply\nchain system, the benefits of repeatable\nengineering will be improved costs, pre-cision, and safety.\nDeliverable: With the full factory\nassembly on one site, it is only a four-year concrete-to-commissioning manufacturing period, where SMR can be\nbrought to site by rail, road, or sea.\nAlongside the technological poten-tial, this SMR programme also has the\npotential to bring \u201cone of the UK\u2019s\nlargest engineering collaborations\u201d, providing jobs, supply chain security, and\nsustainable value, all alongside low-car-bonenergysupply.Rolls-Royce,predicts\nthat its SMR program could contribute\n\u00a3100 billion to the UK economy by\n2050, generate 40,000 skilled jobs and\ntap into a \u00a3400bn global export market.\nRolls-Roycehasnine expertnuclearsites\nacross the UK, as well as several abroad,\nbeing involved in the nuclear submarine\nsector since the 1950s, but intends to expand this. Their potential for this secure\nenergy supply technology to create a\nsignificant global market, the SMR market has been valued at \u00a3150-400bn, this\nmarket needs to be tapped into.\nAs the Nuclear sector prepares to\nhold a central role in the global energy\nmix, two key considerations must be\naddressed: nuclear security and nuclear\nsafety. Nuclear security is the technical\nmeasures designed to reduce the likelihood of installation, operation, and\ndecommissioning accidents and their\ncorresponding consequences. Nuclear\nsafety is the implementation of accident\ncontrol mechanisms to ensure radiological damage to the surrounding environment and people is greatly reduced. The\nRolls-Royce SMR program hopes to not\nonly make technological impact but also\nserious safety culture changes within\nthe nuclear sector to ensure the growth\nof this market is not limited by poor\nmanagement of nuclear risks. Therefore,\nthrough the regulatory bodies of the\nOffice for Nuclear Regulation (ONR)\nand Environmental Agency (EA), RollsRoyce has enacted 270 redesign decisions with a team of 300 full-time safety\ndesign engineers to ensure this collaborative approach with UK regulators will\nallow for a confident deployment of this\ntechnology. Since this pre-licensing engagement,Rolls-Roycehassecured\u00a3210\nmillion from the UK government alongside \u00a3350 million from private investors\nto bring Rolls-Royce SMR Limited to\nmarket.\nAswellasexpandingtheircommercial\ncapabilities, Rolls-Royce understands\nthe importance of technical expertise\nin this industry to ensure long-term viability of this SMR program. Alongside\nlocal/regional government and private\nfunding, Rolls-Royce has developed 25\nUniversity Technology Centres (UTC)\nin the UK running multiple research\nprogrammes. This academic consorti-um, including Cambridge, Oxford, and\nImperial College London, to support\ncurrent technology and create future\nsynergies, deploying new nuclear power\nintoemergingandmilitaryprogrammes.\nThe nuclear sector is about to evolve and\nerupt; Rolls-Royce aims to be at the\nfront of this.\nFRIDAY 10THDECEMBER 2021\nSCIENCE\n7\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nSmall Modular Reactors: Nuclear\u2019s\nchance to regain its power\nWilliam Draper-Barr Science Writer\nI am Billy, the 2021/22 manager of the Imperial Energy Podcast\nfrom the Imperial College Energy Society.

He guides the reader through seven\nhabitsthatcanchangethelivesofanyonewhoaimsand\nhopes to achieve big. The seven habits are be proactive;\nbegin with the end in mind, put first things first; seek\nto understand, then be understood; think win-win;\nsynergise; and sharpen the saw. The former three habits\ndelineate the importance of independence and self-de-pendence. The latter three focus on interdependence,\nindicating that prioritising our well-being is crucial in\nlearning to help and appreciate others. The final habit\nis the culmination of all the other lessons and describes\nthe significance of constantly working on ourselves and\nbalancing the various aspects of our lives. Persistent\nimprovement is necessary\nto lay a foundation of our\nprinciples and gradually\nbuild a tower of success\nand fulfil our ambitions.\nWhile the seven habits\nmay seem fathomable at\nfirst glance and obvious,\nthe prodigious amount of\nknowledge poured into\nthe description of the\nhabits is boundless. The\nbook is a treasure trove of\nreal-life examples packed\nwith meaning and en-lightenment. As someone\nwho always hoped to improve my abilities in performing tasks when I was\nyounger, just one quick\nglimpsethroughthethirdhabitinthebooksuggestedI\nshouldglancethroughthe\u2018QuadrantsofPriorities\u2019and\ntry the Quadrant II method. The Quadrant II method\nurges us to prioritise \u2018important and non-urgent\u2019 tasks.\nWithout question, following this method has tremendously improved my ability to sort out my priorities.\nWhile reading the book can give the reader the zest\nto dive head-first into the habits, one must first balance\nproduction and production capabilities (P/PC). This\nconcept is encapsulated by Covey through the famous\nAesop\u2019s Fable about the goose and the golden eggs. The\nfable describes a poor farmer who \u2013 by chance \u2013 finds\nagoosethatyields\ngolden eggs, thus\nproviding riches and immense\nwealth to the\nfarmer. However, his avarice\ngets the better of\nhim when he decides to kill the\ngoose and find\nout if it contains\na limitless supply\nof golden eggs.\nHe found none\nand was also no\nlonger able to\nget more eggs.\nHence, it is necessary we grant ourselves enough time and patience to master each habit one by one, rather than\nreturning to a slump after a week of adherence\nto an immensely rigid and impractical routine.\nI believe the distinctive quality of the book that\nhas engrossed millions of people across the globe\nis Stephen Covey\u2019s intuitive style of writing. Philosophy interspersed with humour and authen-tic, concrete examples render a sense of relatabil-ity and immersion, making the reader feel as if\nthey are reading about aspects of their own life.\nIndubitably, I would highly recommend the book to\nanyone. Even if you are not a bibliophile or have never\nperused philosophy books, this would be the perfect\nbeginner\u2019s guide, and I hope the habits leave a lasting impression on your mind, just as they did for me.\nAkshara Chandrashekar Books Writer\n\u201c\nPHILOSOPHY\nINTERSPERSED\nWITH HUMOUR\nAND AUTHENTIC,\nCONCRETE EXAMPLES\nRENDER A SENSE OF\nRELATABILITY AND\nIMMERSION\nQuadrant of priorities\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 10THDECEMBER 2021\nEdited by: Eva Borras\nFilm\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk 23\nOscar Healy Film Writer\nSofia Coppola\u2019s portrayal of\nrelationships, 20 years apart\nFilm Director Review\nLost in Translation (2003) is a raw depiction of that\nstrange isolation that comes with spending time\nin cultures so different from your own. Written and\ndirected by Sofia Coppola, the stunning background\nof Tokyo showcases an intimate relationship between\ntwo Americans living in Japan; embracing those fleeting moments of pure connection that can underscore a\nlife. Bob Harris (Bill Murray), an ageing movie star on\na trip to promote Suntory whisky, finds himself losing\ncontrol of his familial and professional life. Whilst\nstaying at the Park Hyatt hotel, he runs into Charlotte\n(Scarlett Johansson), a recent Yale graduate whose\nrecent marriage to a celebrity photographer is also\nproving tiresome.\nFrom this point on, one might expect a standard\nrom-com to ensue, however, Lost in Translation is anything but. The relationship that develops between Bob\nand Charlotte is lively but innocent, characterised by\ntheir bonding over culture shock and shared feelings of\nalienation. Bill Murray manages to perfectly combine\ntheindifferenceandmelancholythatcansignaltheend\nof a long relationship with his established skill in improvisational comedy. A 17-year-old Scarlett Johansson plays brilliantly opposite this: her portrayal of an\nintelligent but distracted young woman brings authenticity to the idea of two lost souls connecting\nCoppola brilliantly evokes a sense of nostalgia and\ndreaminess through the use of quick cuts and sometimes overwhelming scenery. Filmed on a tight budget\nand with an almost documentary-style shooting, Coppola used a small crew to film the Tokyo streets with\nalmost no artificial lighting, taking advantage of the\ncrowded streets instead of hiring extras. These details\npaint a very naturalistic portrait of the city, which becomes a perfect backdrop for Bob and Charlotte\u2019s in-tense, flirty and oftentimes awkward friendship. The\nfilm dances from location to location, each one emphasising the couple\u2019s unfamiliarity with their setting and\nbringing them closer together.\nLost in Translation is by no means perfect, but it\nis beautiful and real. A tale of finding someone who\nbrings you happiness in troubled times, but whose love\nis so special precisely because it is fleeting. It is, as Coppola herself puts it, \"Just for the moment\".\nOn the other hand, On the Rocks (2020) is a much\nmore recent collaboration between Coppola and\nMurray, a comedy-drama that leans more heavily into\ncomedy than Coppola\u2019s previous works. Laura Keane\n(Rashida Jones) is a novelist and mother of two young\nchildren, constantly battling with writer's block and\nthe tough banalities of family life. On top of this, she\nsuspects her husband, Dean (Marlon Wayans), is being\nunfaithfulduetomanysmallclues:awoman\u2019stoiletries\nin his luggage, cosy hotel bookings for business trips\nabroad, etc. Bill Murray stars as Felix Keane, Laura\u2019s\nfather, a retired art dealer and playboy, who believes\nall men are hardwired to cheat and who flirts with\nevery woman he meets, much to the dismay of Laura. Though his views are antiquated and misogynistic\n\u2013 \u2018You\u2019re mine until you\u2019re married\u2019 he tells a young\nLaura as the opening line of the film \u2013 he desperately wants to connect with the daughter he loves. When\nLaura opens up about her suspicions of infidelity, Felix immediately uses this opportunity to bond with\nhis daughter through wacky capers and heart-to-heart\nconversations.\nWith a more cut and dry rom-com plot, Coppola\nstill does not disappoint as she flaunts the streets of\nNew York and the beautiful interiors of buildings that\nonly relatively privileged characters (like the Keanes)\ncan frequent. The score by Phoenix complements this\nwith upbeat, if sometimes a bit sparse, electropop.\nThe theme of insecurity is vital in this film, Laura\u2019s\nworries of infidelity are an extension of her general\nanxieties as she approaches middle-age, and Felix only\nexacerbates these as he struggles with his own past.\nThese are played subtly and excellently by Jones and\nMurray, who convey the notion of past family troubles\nthrough tense but understanding dialogue. The comedic moments are mainly derived from the ever-present\ngenerational gap between father and daughter, and the\nfilm succeeds in making the audience cringe along with\nLaura whilst sympathising for them both at the same\ntime. Rashida Jones perfectly plays a patient and caring mother, who puts on a brave face even as her life is\nseemingly crumbling around her. In her conversations\nwith Felix, we see her anxieties explored and intensi-fied, while he is simply looking for a reason to talk to\nand spoil his daughter.\nIf Lost in Translation is an exploration of short, aro-mantic connections, On the Rocks is its counterpart:\ndelving into the trials of long-term commitments and\nthe importance of romance in life and relationships.\n\n"

On\nDecember 8th, they would be entering\nthe High Court to explain their case\u2014\nstating that the UK government\u2019s\ncurrent commitment to new fossil fuel\nprojects is unlawful, going against their\npledge to net zero by 2050.\nPtP comprises of three claimants:\nMikaela Loach, Kairin van Sweeden,\nand Jeremy Cox (alongside a number\nof lawyers). They are targeting a crucial\npart of the UK\u2019s fossil fuel strategy:, the\nuse of public money given as handouts\nand subsidies to the fossil fuel industry.\nSince the Paris Agreement was signed,\n\u00a34 billion of public money has been\npaidtoNorthSeaoilandgascompanies.\nOverall,oilandgascompanieshavebeen\ngiven \u00a313.6 billion.\nThis comes alongside the approval\nof \u201cat least 40 new coal, oil and gas\nextractionprojectsintheUK\u201d,according\ntoFriendsoftheEarth,anenvironmental\ncampaigning organisation.

This withdrawal\nof support has plunged ideas of future\noil exploration in the area into doubt.\nAccording to Greenpeace, Cambo was\nprojected to produce the equivalent\ndamage of 18 coal-fired power stations.\nPtP are also motivated by the tax-dodging nature of fossil fuel companies.\nIt was recently revealed that Shell and\nBP, responsible for emitting 1.7 billion\ntonnes of greenhouse gases a year, have\npaid no corporation tax for the last three\nyears, while claiming tax relief of \u00a3400\nmillion.\nInananalysis byRystadEnergy,itwas\ndiscovered that the UK is currently the\nmost profitable country in the world for\nthe development of oil and gas projects.\nDecommissioning projects in the North\nSea will be fueled by \u00a318 billion of\npublic funds up to 2065.

But conservation\nin a broader sense is an approach\ntowardsalong-termgoalofsafeguarding\nbiodiversity for future generations. Yet,\nas people continue to exploit our natural\nresources, numerous species risk being\nseriously threatened, or even thrown to\nthe brink of extinction.\nWildlife conservation also\nincorporates restoration of natural\nenvironments like forests and other\nanimalhabitats.Forestscover30%ofthe\nworld\u2019s land area, but are disappearing at\nan alarming rate. Since 1990, the planet\nhas lost about a billion acres of forest.\nThis is where ecological restoration\nbecomes vital for the sustenance of our\nwild reserves.

The truth is that all kinds of\nanimals play a role in maintaining the\nbalance of our ecosystem\u2014from acting\nas pest control, to pollinating crops\nand plants, and even combating climate\nchange.

It is applaudable how the show almost\nmakes a point of not making a point of this diversity.\nIt would not only be impossible but also completely\nbeside the point to list all of these instances. However,\nmost notably, Christopher\u2019s mother Judy is played by\nSophie Stone, a deaf actress who carries the role majes-tically. Stone delivers an emotionally raw performance\nwhich acts as a constant reminder to the audience that\nthese characters may as well have been real people with\nreal emotions. Theatre as a medium relies heavily on\nsuspension of disbelief. This suspension of disbelief\nonly works when the audience is engrossed into what\u2019s\nhappening on stage, and believing the actors is a large\npart of what allows this to happen.\nIhold A Christmas Carol very dear to my heart, as it\nwas one of the first (if not the first) books I read in\nEnglish as a young boy, far away from the UK. Besides,\nhow can one have any negative feelings for a story that\npreaches the importance of love and kindness in our\nlives.\nThe play, although rewritten for a modern audience,\nstays true to the source material. Jack Thorne, who\nmost notably penned the ever so divisive Harry Potter\nand the Cursed Child, manages to capture Dickens\u2019s\nmessage. He preserves the old-timely feel of the Victorian-era classic, and its attitude towards Christmas \u2014\nall the while not allowing it to feel tired.\nFrom the moment you enter the Old Vic\u2019s audi-torium, the audience is greeted with mince pies. The\nensemble cast is on stage, fully engaging with the au-dience, conversing with the children present, and\nthrowing tangerines for audience members to catch.\nThe play is performed in the round, which adds to\nthe immersiveness. The stage itself is modestly sized\nbut has a large podium that extends all the way to the\nback of the stalls, which the cast makes great use of\nthroughout the two-hour performance. Countless lanterns hang down from the ceiling:, not merely setting\nthe scene, but almost acting as a character of their own\n\u2014 lighting up in patterns and contributing to the progression of the narrative.\nThe actors commit wholeheartedly to the story, and\nare clearly having fun performing. Stephen Mangan\nshines as Scrooge: letting his voice fill the auditorium\nwhen he needs it to, but equally knowing when to dial\nit back to serve the story.\nAlthough the show is engaging throughout, it does\nfalter in the beginning of the second act \u2014 resorting\nto clich\u00e9 visuals and text which one can\u2019t help but roll\none\u2019s eyes at.

    "content": "What is a play? Is it a tragedy or a comedy; a\nmere three-act narrative; or something more\nimmersive and reflective? This is one of the fundamental questions pondered by the human company\nand, perhaps, the synthetic mind that featured in this\nlive performance workshop. The stated goal of the\nproduction was to, over the course of the three nights\nthat the show ran, develop a play written primarily\nby an artificially intelligent system \u2014 the eponymous\nAI. To this end, a company of self-dubbed writer,\nperformer, and director-engineers take to the stage,\narmed with laptops and a Google doc, to interface\nwith OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3. Together they act out, discuss,\nand shape the machine-generated text into something\nworth watching.\nThe result is a foretelling experience of how invaluable human frailty and imagination is to a narrative ex-perience.TheAIsystemis,toitscredit,articulate,lewd,\nand\u2013not out of place in the London theatre scene\u2013appears to have an uncanny penchant for writing about\nrape, destruction, and death. It is also, if we want to be\nblunt about it, pretty dumb. For all GPT-3\u2019s ability to\nconstruct flowing and, at times, profound text; there\nis a subtle but unmistakable lack of contextual awareness that gives its responses a surreal and inhuman feel.\n\u201cGive us a real limerick!\u201d shouts a frustrated audience\nmember.Whenapoetbreakstherules,it\u2019smeaningful;\nwhen a machine does it, it\u2019s wrong? With this in mind,\nit was the two writer-engineers, Chinonyerem Odimba\n(Chino) and Nina Segal, that captured my attention in\na new way. Aside from the art of designing prompts in\nitself, Chino and Nina seemed to have a firm grasp and\na hot take on how to make the most of this strange new\ntool through composition and curation.\nAs an AI researcher, I, like most in my field, am\nacutely familiar with the repetitive, engrossing, and\nfiddly process of interacting with \u201cintelligent\u201d systems.\nIt is for this reason that it was fascinating to see both\nthe writers engage with that same process but from an\nartistic and creative perspective; and with the far more\ninformal, complex, and nuanced natural language \u2014\nEnglish. Centre stage, they both had the air of an early Victor Frankenstein, building a creation from their\nnewfound insight into this new form of\u2026 life? Technically,GPT-3isamachinethatmakespredictions;more\nspecifically, predictions about what the next letter,\nword, or phrase in some text might be. Accordingly,\nthere is a fine art to crafting useful prompts for GPT-3\nto autocomplete, and a requirement for some creative\nconsolidationofitsoutput.Andhereinliesthetrueval-ue of this production: the interactive and collaborative\nnature of the company on stage: machines and humans\nincluded. Tyrone Huggins, a performer-engineer, delivers an impassioned monologue from GPT-3 on free\nwill; Simone Saunders finds a very raw and believable\ncharacter in an apocalyptic tale; and all three, including the final \u2018performer-engineer\u2019 Waleed Akhtar, find\nsomething surreal and piquant as \u201cThe Beastmen\u201d.\nA common theme in both this performance and\ncontemporary AI research is the automated and, per-haps, undesirable learning of biases prevalent in input\ndatasets. GPT-3 is based on the structure and content\nof a corpus of English text, what it spits out is invent-ed, sure, but it is also fundamentally a snapshot of a\nreflection on our society. This phenomenon was most\nevident in the monologues generated by the system,\nand obvious biases in dialogical casting. Waleed as a\nterrorist, groundbreaking(!). I\u2019m not convinced this\ncompany explored the issue in the best way; if the key\nis indeed to be found in the interaction between metal\nand mind then perhaps there is more to be explored in\nhow we, now, can subvert, reinvent, and reclaim these\nstories. But it was amusing nonetheless that, amongst\ndiscussions of free will and determinism, and how\nGPT-3 is just a mirror of society, that the audience satisfies almost all expectations and requests a sexual limerick from the off.\nLike any matter worth discussing, there are prescient\nphilosophical issues that rise straight to the surface in\nthe wake of this new play. Could something written by\na machine be art? Are the machinations of silicon and\nmetal really so different to their organic counterparts?\nCan one be an artist without a subjective experience of\none\u2019s own? There are no answers here, but it certainly\nfeels as though it is the start of a long journey into a\nnew type of theatre. I can\u2019t help but feel that the real\nartistic magic in this production was in the composi-tion; the piecing together of fragments generated by a\nmonkey and a typewriter. For this, it is the generality,\nbreadth, and sheer randomness that seems to be both\nrequired and only present in humans, at least for now.\nMagic has an awful habit of looking like science when\nwe know how it works, I hope we can retain some of\nthe trepidation and potentiality that filled the Young\nVic as we see more technological changes in the whole\ntheatre creation process.\nFRIDAY 10TH DECEMBER 2021\n12\nARTS\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nWrite us a new play, HAL!\nReviewed by Alex Jackson Arts Editor\nAI\nWhere?
