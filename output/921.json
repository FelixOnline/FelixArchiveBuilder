He went red and began\nsweating, blending nicely into the\ncrowd.\nThey continued swimming through the soup of music, people\nand tension before reaching a dim\ncorner table where Carefree sat\ndown with several other shaded and\nshady people.\n'Sit down.'\nStress obeyed.\n'Listen to me.'\nEveryone leaned forward in their.\n'Sorry?'\n'Plug!'\nT don't see what you mean.'\n' Oh, I see. You're playing hard\nto get. Okay then, pretty plug?!'\nStress looked at her in\nbewilderment and some fear. -' -' Um okay.'\n'Right, extend your jack line\nthen.'\n'What?'\n'Sheesh, I 'll do it for you then.'\nShe reached around his waist.\nT can never understand why they\ndon't have an easier way of\nThe Inner system\nChapter 9;\nConversation.\nBy Troy\nTempest.\nCarefree hit him again.\n'Time to go!'\nGroggy and semi-conscious,\nStress staggered after her as she\nstrode off down the tunnel. She\nthreaded through the maze of\npassageways and the near darkness\nbefore coming out in a dim red neon\nsection of the inner system. Before\nthem in a tall corridor with many\nentrances the nightclub POWER PLUGS flashed a welcome out of\nthe darkness in painful blue and\nultra-violet neon. Carefree strode\nforward.\nAt the door of the club a four foot\nwide robot bouncer had been built\ninto the wall. Unfortunately the\nbuilders hadn't made allowances for\nthis which meant that Stress and\nCarefree had to squeeze between\nthe bouncer and the other door\nframe.\n' ID!' The voice was so low the wall\nshuddered. Carefree handed him\ntwo cards. The bouncer checked\nthem before extending an antenna\nout of his lapel which sent a thin red\nbeam up and down the pair of them.\nThey passed through into the club.\nAs they threaded through the\ncrowds Stress wondered why the\nlighting seemed to be giving the\npeople a funny complexion. Then\nhe suddenly realised that it was\nbecause they were all deeply\ntanned. The knowledge came back\nseats, clustering around Carefree.\n' We can talk in complete\nfreedom, No one can overhear us\nfrom another table.' It was true. In\nthe heat, smoke and perfume the\nwords were coughing and dying as\nsoon as they were leaving her\nmouth.\nT Carefree Killing have gained\ndirect evidence of the terrible\norganisation outside of our system.'\nStress nodded and looked interested.\n'The pale faces are just outside\nthe system! They're wearing suits\nand look highly organised!'\nStress stopped nodding. He\ngaped.\n'We've had a tip off. There's a lady over at the bar who works in\none of the complex's top secret\ndepartments. Stress, an alien here\nto help us, will go over and chat to\nher. They'll plug and go off\ntogether. Stress will find everything\nabout the department and report\nback to us. If they catch him and kill\nhim they won't be able to connect\nhim with us.'\n'Wait a second. I can't agree with\nall this!'\n'Look, alien.'\nAll faces turned to him and he felt\nvery alone.\n'If you are thinking about\nchickening out.'\nShe held up a small black gun.\n'This is a futility gun. It passed\nthrough the door check because it\ndoesn't fire bullets but it'll kill you\nall the same. Now, are we agreed?'\nStress dumbly nodded.\n' Now strap this box around your\nwaist. It's a match man programmed\nwith all the things she's looking for.\nYou' ll know when to use it.'\nMeekly Stress tied the black box\naround his waist and clambered\nover to the bar. Squeezing into a space by the girl he said loudly to\nher ear.\n'Would you like a drink?'\n'Yeah, okay. Would you like to\nplug?'\nchecking the character compatibility\nof citizens.'\nShe grabbed the box and pulled\nan extendable lead from it. She\ngrasped the jack at the end and\ninserted in a socket in the blackbox\nclearly visible under her tight, small\nt shirt. On a small screen on its side\nwords and numbers started\nflickering down the screen.\nCompatibility Values:\nAttractiveness 85%\nWealth: 78%\nInfluence: 93%\nHeight: 84%\nAmbition: 82%\nParents: 23%\nThe last line flashed bright red.\nWith a big sigh the girl pulled the\njack out and handed it back to\nStress.\n'Oh well. We could have made\na great couple. Bye!' She wandered off down the bar.\nStress gulped his drink and glanced\nbehind him. At the table Carefree\npulled out the gun and aimed at\nhim, fingering the trigger. Seized\nby sud een fear Stress threw himself\nto the right as the barman behind\nhim suddenly shouted;\n' AAAAAA HH HH HH!!! What's the point!!'\nCarefree swore and aimed again\nat him. Panicking, Stress ran down\nthe bar, spilling drinks and\ninterrupting plug gers. Behind him\nthere were scattered sobs and cries\nof despair as Carefree tried to hit\nthe fleeing fugitive.\nStress had almost reached the end\nof the bar when he pulled up short,\nrealising with unknown clarity of\nmind that all this pointless running\naway was a waste of time. He\nwasn't going to get away so he may\nas well go back and get it over with.\nHe was about to turn around and\nwalk back to the table when part of\nthe floor in front of him slid aside\nand a bulky shape in a tuxedo\nswung up out of the floor at him.\n'Got ya punk!'\nA forehead hit him in the face\nwith stunning force and he blacked\nout.\nIC ENTS PRESENT\nCARNIVAL\n'92\nfeaturing THE RISING HIGH RAVE with the Hypnotist plus FLOOD UNION BUILDING\n10th JANUARY 1992\n\u2022cocktails * food * bar til 2am TICKETS \u00a35 adv, \u00a36 on the door\n\u00a34 Ents Cards\nDOORS OPEN 8PM Women's homeward transport service available after midnight\n\u2014 10\u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Union Felix 921 10 January 1992\nPoet Dear Marge...\nHello again after the Christmas\nbreak.\nAnother term of fun and frolics\nupon us all, so what's ahead?\nParties and bands first, tonight is\nthe New Year's Carnival,\nPeople should note that the Union\nbar is only open to Carnival goers\nand entry is only allowed with a Union card, doors open at 8pm. Yet more live bands play for free\non Mondays this term.\nNot many people expect free bands\nto be any good, so pop along, you\nwill be pleasantly surprised.\nEvery second Wednesday (starting\nnext week) hosts the bar quiz.\nWe have a new quiz master this\nterm, so come and stretch your\nbrain a little.\nYet again, we have lots of bar\nextensions and discos, hopefully we\nshould have extensions on\nWednesdays and Fridays (it all\ndepends what the nice police people\nsay).\nElections crop up in February, with\nthe sabbatical posts up for grabs\nfrom 17th February.\nAll other posts are open for election\nfrom 24th February.\nResults for all of these will be.\ndecided at the U GM( and election\nresults meeting) on March 12th. Steve Farrant, Hon Sec (Events)\nRag\nThe Rag New Year began in earnest\non January 2nd when Penguin,\nTamsin and myself set off for\nCardiff for the National Rag\nConference 1992. An annual event\nwith almost 200 delegates from\nRags as far apart as Wye College\nKent and Edinburgh University, the\naim of the conference is to help\nRags liaise, swap ideas, meet\ncharities and to discuss all aspects\nof running and organising a Charity\nRag.\nThursday was basically arrival\nand introductions followed by an\namazing five legged pub crawl and\nBlues Brothers disco. Friday saw\nthe start of the Seminars on subjects\nranging from Silly Stunts, i.e. Bungy Jumping, Rag Balls and\nBalls Ups, and sponsored events to\nRag Mags, Finance (or how to\nfiddle your tax), Merchandise and\nMotivation. Also running throughout the day was the\nCharities and trade fair which\nprovided an excellent opportunity to\nmeet some of the Charities Rag\nWelcome to the new year and\nwelcome to another issue of Dear\nMarge. The place where you can\npick up all the juicy tit bits about\nthe people we all know and love.\nBefore the end of term there were\neven more goings on around college\nthat we felt people just had to know\nabout. Zoe' Hellinmoose, our\nbeloved Pres person was seen out\nand about quite a lot in the final\nweeks of term and with several\ndifferent members of the college.\nThe first occasion was at the St.\nMary's Christmas musical where\nshe was seen by one of our intrepid\nreporters in the company of C& GU bolt bearer, Mark Jackson alias\nCARRY\nYOUR\nUNION\nCARDS\nTo protect both you and the Union\nBuilding, during busy evenings, new\nsecurity arrangements have been\nintroduced. This will mean that on\nWednesday and Friday evenings all\nvisitors will be required to show their\nUnion cards/Staff cards or be signed in\nas guests (up to two per Union card\nholder) before entry will be permitted.\nsupports and establish contacts with\nthem for the future.\nSunday saw the first AGM of\nNAR( National Association of\nRags), set up at last year's conference, after which we all\npacked up and went our separate\nways, having learnt (and drunk and\ndanced) a lot, over what was\ndefinitely a highly productive and\nenjoyable weekend.\nRachel Mountford.\nTrigger, for some unknown reason.\nWas this true love blossoming? I fear not, for only a week later she\nwas seen to be leaving the bar with\na member of the other side - R CSU Theta bearer, Bob Leamon. Is Lady\nPenelope a one for the gents or was\nthis all harmless frolics - (being\ndiscreet and unavoidable of course)? Later that same week she\nwas at the mines ball with none\nother than Mr. Steve Farrant,\nUnion Honorary Secretary - come\non down Steve the time is right!\nJust as an after note... what is this\nwe hear about Joe Fernley and Zoe\nHellinmoose at the piss up after the\nsecond council of last term? They\nwere 'left alone' together for far too\nlong and were noted to have had a very steamy evening together. Will this, or any other event, be denied?\nI wonder.\nIt also seems that Trigger himself\nhas been out on the town too. He\nwas seen at a party 'sharking' after\na young - very young - exceedingly\nyoung - in fact only 14 years of age\n- young lady just before the end of\nterm. Does this mean that the great\nwhite has resorted to pae do philia as\nhe has failed in every other area?\nA few other little tit bits for this\nweek include...\nDid you know that Mandy Hurford,\nUnion Manager, only joined\nNAL GO a week before the strike\non the 4th December over the\nsecurity redundancies? Well I never.\nAlso the fact that Ramesh and\nJarve, our two full time Union bar\nstaff really are the two most\nincompatible people on earth and\nthat if we're not careful there will\nbe blood shed before too long.\nJust remember that if you have a problem of any kind we could\npublish it, take the mickey and\nmaybe even cure your problem,\nexcept if you fancy a sabbatical for\nwhich the only cure is suicide!\nCarnival '92\nA new term, new year and probably\na new jumper. To celebrate, Ents\nproudly present ' CARNIVAL'92' tonight (Friday January 10th) in the\nUnion Building. If you came to any\nof the Freshers' Week events you\nknow what to expect\u2014hour upon\nhour of bands, music, food, drink,\ncasinos and cocktails. If you have\nany booty to shake, you will shake\nit down to the ground.\nRising High, the dance label\nthat's so hot its melting, bring the\nfamous Rising High Rave to the\nConcert Hall\u2014six hours of heavy\nduty 3 D sound, crazy lights and\neffects, featuring DJs, dancers and\ntop techno twiddle rs The Hypnotist.\nPrepare to rage. Downstairs its\nindie kids Flood\u2014they've been\ncompared to Ride\u2014plus an indie\nand 70s disco. The notorious C&G casino will be stripping shorts off\nbacks in the UD H and the bar will\nkeep on serving until 2am. Doors\nopen at 8pm, everything winds\ndown at 3am. As usual there will\nbe free minibus rides home for\nwomen. At \u00a36 on the door its a steal. And if you buy a ticket in\nadvance it's only a fiver! We must\nbe mad! We're giving them away!\nEntrance by ticket only.\n\n"

I think not, but\nmost of the people who go and see\nit should be. With their Mexican\nbeers and their fake shabby dress,\nit makes me want to puke. Queuing\nout side they swap stories, and ask\n'do they check id here?', sixteen\nyear olds that think smoking is cool\nand wear jeans with holes cut in\nthem by their mummy's scissors.\nThey try so hard to be cool and fail\nby not being themselves. The bands\nare good, but not that good. When\na band like Revolver can be\nRant\nFriday night huh? What are you\ndoing tonight, dear heart? Going\ndown Southside? Working away\nover another stir fry? Going to the\nunion, God forbid? Six quid for a jumped up disco with all the same\nsex-obsessed lager louts and a band\ncalled Flood. You' d have to pay me\nto make me see Flood again. I know\nwhereof I speak. They're rope y with a capital Rope. And after last\nterm's auspicious start. I mean two\nbearable bands in one night (Pele,\netc.). Unheard of in recent history.\nSo what do I suggest? Simple.\nLook down into the magic box\nbelow, and stab at it with a pin. I 've\neven included directions for you, so\nno excuses on that front. You can\nsee a half decent band or two. Meet\nnew people, you too can find love.\nAnd why stop with tonight? Fair\nenough, there's sod all on for the\nmajority of next week, but I 've dug\nout a couple for you. How easy can\nyou get? A ready made new year\nresolution.\nPoddy Music Ed. levitated to the altar of indie gods\nit bodes none too well for the future.\nSome people are dancing but are\nalso looking around to see it they\nare doing it properly, trying to look\nmean and moody but ending up like\na flock of sheep. Then they finish,\nand return for the encore that hadn't even been asked for, how sad. Then\nthey go for good, the crowd turn\naway and forget what has just\nhappened in an instant, they have\nthe 'c red points' and that's all\nthey're here for. It's a sad night for\nmusic, not the music exactly but I think these 'indie kids' should get\na life before they ruin live music\nand the very gods they pray to.\nPebbles.\nTONIGHT The Jennifers.

The other\nfour thousand people here make the\nkind of noise a cow makes when\nshe's happy, lowing in agreement.\nAre they perhaps annoyed at Shane\ndeparting the group, but who's fault\nwas that? The lights dim and six\nIrish men come on, and a smaller\nguy carrying a beaten up guitar.\nOne bang on the drums and they're\noff. The small one ap roaches the\nmic and all hell is let rip. He sounds\nstrangely Irish but doesn't look it,\nhe's shaking like Elvis Presley on\nspeed. By now the banner, that had\nsomehow managed to get hung on\nthe walls, has been ripped down,\nperhaps all is forgiven? They play\nthrough what must be a very tried\nand tested set, with one o ditty inserted. The only way you can tell\nreally is its the only time they don't use the accordion. The show is\ngood, but how will I remember it?\nProbably by the very nice way the\npeople apologised for landing on\nmy feet. Very civilised.\nPebbles.\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion Felix 921 10 January 1992\nThe workforce has won all the\narguments\u2014on ground of management's chosing. If it's security you want then the last thing\nyou should do is hire a labour-only\ncontractor paying poverty wages. If\nyou want to avoid the nastier\nconfrontations as soca ted with the\njob, you don't want brawny young\nmen doing it. The secret is to have\npeople who know all the wrinkles\nof Imperial's jumble of buildings.\nGetting rid of their valuable\nexperience and commitment could\nprove a costly mistake. And that's it is obvious that the problem of\nfunding is reason enough to regard\nthe workforce as wholly d is pensi ble \u2014with, of course, a bob\nor two to take down the road. These\nmanagers simply do not share the .\nsame moral universe as the security'\nstaff.\nThis is where management\nhierarchies merge so neatly into a distinctively British class\nbackground. Decisions to excise\npeople en masse them from a tradition older than the industrial\nrevolution. Indeed, if Marx was\nSecure\nTom Snow, Area\nofficer of the\nTrade Union\nNUPE, opines\non the recent\nsecurity debacle.\nAngus Fraser,\nCollege\nManaging\nThoughts\nbefore you think about them!\nBut it appears many have thought\nabout their plight.\nWhen people use coercion against\ntheir fellow human beings they\nusually have a moral explanation for\ntheir actions. In other words they\ncan give you reasons why they think\nthey have right on their side. So the\nworkforce, in it's all-out strike on\n8th November, believed it was\ndoing no more than defending itself\nfrom Imperial's stated intention to\nclose the job down.\nBut what of the moral basis of management's position? The Director of Estates gave us two\nanswers which would appear to\noccupy that special place in everyday thought normally reserved\nfor morality. The first was that his\n'remit' was to save 30 per cent on\nwage costs. The second was that his\nplans were 'normal commercial\npractice'.\ndirector, replies\nopposite.\nThe first reply is simply that of\nthe bureaucratic post holder. It\nmeans T have a duty to my\nsuperiors and I am only carrying out\ntheir orders.' This locates the\nproblem further up the hierarchy.\nAnd that is just the point. The\nmanagement decision makers are,\nin every sense, so far removed from\nthe workforce that its human\nqualities are too abstract to have any\nimpact on their decisions. To them\nright, several centuries of enclosure, and later the large scale\nand much more rapid highland\nclearances, created the conditions\nnecessary for the mer gence of genuine capitalist agriculture and\nfuelled the Industrial cities with\nlabour. The moral justifications was\n'improvement'. Coercing people in\nthe common interest runs deep in\nour national culture.\nCoercing workers is something\nthe holders of great power have\nalways had others to do for them.\nApart from the odd landowner with\na convenient coal mine underneath,\nthey certainly never soiled their\nfingers with anything to do with\nindustry. They were instead\nthoroughly obsequious to the\nindustrial capitalists who succeeded\u2014by providing their sons\nwith wives and showering them\nwith dotty honours. Whether the\ncontemporary ruling elite can bring\nitself to fill the tawdry House of\nLords with Japanese managers\nremains to be seen.\nAnd that brings me to the second\nmoral argument for a private\nsecurity workforce \u2014 ' normal commercial practice'. Again we\nfind a vast gulf between people,\nbridged only by price and contract.\nCommerce can wipe a whole\nworkforce off the balance sheet by\nvirtue of its ability to avoid the\nquestion of proper conduct towards\nthe people it excludes by price.\nSo why didn't it work here? Well,\nwe have a nice little illustration of just how far commerce depends on\nthe absence of any social link\nbetween those who make the deals\nand those who suffer their effects.\nHowever much Imperial may be\ndivided by chasms of class and\nstatus, it has proved to be a remarkably resilient moral\ncommunity.

    "content": "10 January 1992 Felix 921 Opinion\nReality Anally caught up with the\nChancellor of the Exchequer,\nNorman Lamont last weekend,\nwhen he admitted that his\npredictions for economic recovery\nin 1992 were 'over optimistic'.\nIt had been a tough week for\nLamont. He came under fire from\nhis own backbencher s, with the\nmost wounding criticism from\nformer minister Michael Spicer,\nwho showed an amazing lack of\nconfidence in the Chancellor: T hope Lamont is right .... it will be\na disaster for us if he gets it wrong\n... we will simply have to deliver\nthe goods.'\nThe damage was worsened when\nthe Prime Minister joined in.\nConsidering that it was Major's mishandling of the economy when\nhe was Chancellor that has landed\nLamont in his current troubles, then\nMajor's support was the last thing\nLamont needed. It only served to\nconfirm the quiet panic on Tory\nbenches.\nMajor's main defence of Lamont\nis that the world recession is to\nblame for the UK downturn. This\nis rubbish and he knows it. Britain's economy went into official\nrecession months before the rest of\nthe globe, and into actual, feel- it-in-your-pocket, recession a long\ntime before that. In fact, when John\nMajor was Chancellor.\nThe question is not really 'who\nstarted the recession?', though the\nanswer lies somewhere between\nThatcher, Lawson and Major. To\nget us out of recession, we need to\nask, 'why is it so deep?'. Step\nbusiness failures, 85,000 home\nrepossessions, and 750,000 more\nunemployed, as explained by\nShadow Chancellor, John Smith,\nduring a recent Commons debate.\nLamont's response was that this is\na price worth paying.\nThere are those on the Tory right\nwing, the rabid right, who blame\nEuropean Exchange Rate\nMechanism (ERM) membership for\nthe depth of the recession. By virtue\ntaxpayers will pay no more - not a penny, 12% of taxpayers who do\nnot pay full National Insurance\ncontributions will now do so. The\n40% tax band will remain\nunchanged, most 4 0 % rate\ntaxpayers will stay at 40%, and a new top rate of 50% will be\nintroduced for salaries close to\n\u00a340,000.\nThese increases will pay for\npension increases of \u00a35 per week\n.John Smith, Shadow Chancellor.\nforward John Major, aspirant bus\nconductor who failed an arithmetic\ntest.\nHis attempt to cure Britain of\nrecession was anal ago us to curing\nblood pressure by strangling the\npatient. His savage increases in\ninterest rates hit small businesses\nand homeowners. What happened\nif they were closed or repossessed?\nTough.\nThe results of this policy are there\nfor all to see. In the past twelve\nmonths, there have been 45,000\nMajor Problems\nof timing, the argument appears\nreasonable. It is, however, wrong.\nERM membership is not the\nproblem. What was the problem\nwas the manner in which Major\nbungled our application. Announced on the eve of the 1990\nTory Party Conference, he gave the\nimpression that the move was\npolitical rather than economic. At a stroke, Major panicked the\nmarkets, damaged confidence, and\ncaused a run on sterling.\nThis policy of back door\ndevaluation and stroke politics has\ncaused misery and hardship to\nmillions.\nDo not be fooled. Tories are not\nworried that the recession is causing\npain. When John Major was\nChancellor he said, ' if it's not\nhurting, it's not working'. Their\nconcern is that this recession, unlike\nthe last Tory recession, is too close\nto the election for comfort.\nSo what do they do? Do they\nannounce innovative policies to kick\nstart the economy out of recession?\nFat chance. How much easier it is\nto bribe the voters with a cut in\nincome tax, or an increase in the\nthresholds.\nEven here, the Tories are split.\nWith some ministers demanding a penny cut in standard rate income\ntax, and others urging caution,\nLabour's trade spokesman Gordon\nBrown has challenged John Major\nto state his position.\nThe position of Neil Kinnock,\nLabour leader, and John Smith is\ncrystal clear. Any1992 budget cut\nin income tax will be restored when\nLabour wins the next election. Neil\nKinnock warns, ' A standard rate cut\nwill rob the National Health Service\nof 1.5 billion pounds'.\nLabour is equally clear on its own\ntax plans, and has been ruthless in\nexposing the Tories as the party of\nhigher taxes. Kinnock says, 'The\ntax burden of the great majority of\nBritish people has gone up in the\nTory years, and we have no wish\nto add to it'.\nSo what is Labour's tax policy?\nEighty-eight per cent of all\nNeil Kinnock, Labour Party lead ei for a single person, and \u00a38 per week\nfor a married couple. They will also\npay for the restoration of child\nbenefit. This is the thrust of\nLabour's anti-poverty campaign.\nThis is our big idea.\nAll this is clear, up front, and\nhonest. Now look at the taxing Tory\nrecord, as shown by Department of\nTrade and Industry (DTI) figures.\nIn 1978-9, a married couple with\ntwo children on average earnings\npaid 35.2% of their gross earnings\nin tax. In 1990-1, the same couple\nnow pay 37.5%\nIn 1978-9, a married couple on\nthree-quarter average earnings paid\n30.9% of their gross earnings in\ntax. In 1990-1, they now pay 34.9%\nNothing clear or upfront about\nthis. Not only do Tory ministers not\ntalk about these figures, but the DTI\ndelayed their publication, and\nthere's certainly nothing honest\nabout Tory tax claims. The Tories\npromised that their government\nwould not double VAT. Under\nLabour, VAT was 8%. Under the\nTories, it is now 17,5%. If the\nTories get back in, VAT could go\nup to 22%, if only to pay for their\nplanned public borrowing.\nAnother Tory tax increase.\nAnother Tory lie. A taxing problem\nindeed for Norman and John.\nDeclan Curry,\nIC Labour\nSociety press\nofficer, does his\nbit for the\nrevolution.\n\u2014 5 \u2014\n\n"

The\nfinal count, which is expected to\nrise when all students have\nregistered, is currently being\nprocessed.\nThe Rector, Sir Eric Ash, has\nemphasised the importance \u2022 of achieving the targets for student\nnumbers, especially the numbers of\nstudents from Britain and the\nEuropean Community, as these\nwere less than the number of students that the College receives\nfunding for from the Universities\nFunding Council ( UFC). Mr Keith\nAccess to the College will be\nseverely restricted out of hours\nwhen the installation of the new\nsecurity 'swipe.card' system is\ncompleted.

Every student and\nmember of staff of Imperial College\nwill be photographed and issued\nwith a pass card, and students of the\nRoyal School of Mines and staff in\nthe Union Office have already been\nphotographed though have not yet\nbeen issued with the cards.\nMr Terry Briley, Deputy Head of\nSecurity, told Felix that the new\nsystem would be a great\nimprovement on the present, which\nhe described as being 'unreliable'.\nHe suggested that other\nA spokeswoman from London\nRegional Transport told Felix that\n'the prices are put up once a year\nonly although this year, we know,\nthey have increased more than\ninflation. All the revenue from the\nfares does go towards keeping the\nservice running and although we get\na grant from the government the\ntaxes that people pay over here are\nfar less than in other countries with\nthe same public services.'\nIt is estimated that the staff and\nstudents of Imperial College spend\nover \u00a3 lm per year on London\nTransport alone.\nHarrison, of the Registry division,\nsaid that this was 'not the case for\npost-graduate student numbers, for\nwhich we are in excess.'\nWhen asked what the possible\nrepercussions of this could be, Mr Harrison replied that he couldn't say exactly as the UFC has\nintroduced a new funding system\nfor this year by which colleges bid\nfor the funds made available by the\nGovernment. As far as\nundergraduates are concerned, Mr Harrison was unable to say what\neffect the apparent surplus in their\nfunding would have, saying that he\ncouldn't 'comment on the claw back\nmechanism.'\nimprovements would include better\ncommunication between security\nguards and explained that this\nwould make the security guards\n'feel safer and more assured'. He continued by saying that the aim of\nthe new system was to stop crime\nthrough 'controlling the perimeter\nand supervising the interior' by\nleaving security guards free to\nprovide a 'patrolling presence' that\nwould deter intruders.\nZoe' Hell ing er,IC Union President, told Felix that the\nchanges would 'decrease the\nobservational work done by security\nguards... releasing some to be on\nthe move'.

Hopefully, this action\nwill also assist in helping to avoid\nany congestion which has\npreviously occasionally occurred at\npeak periods.\nNaturally, I am anxious that we\nare seen to provide a quality\nbanking service for our much\nvalued college clientele as I trust is\nindicated by the action we are\ncurrently taking with the intention\nof making life easier for our\ncustomers.\nYours sincerely,\nG Jamieson, Imperial College\nService.\ness Waffle Ta Very Much\nDear Adam,\nTom di Giovanni (Felix No919) need have no worry about a Christian writing a narrow-minded\nand ill-reasoned article in Felix.\nThey're so damned good at them\nthey can have them printed in much\nloftier publications. I would be\ngrateful if he could qualify his\nstatement that ' we are all brainwashed from a very early age\ninto thinking that the world has no\nneed for God...'. I don't know in\nwhich country's education system\nhe was brought up in, but I would\nbe very surprised if it was Britain.\nIn my formative years Christianity\nwas all that was pumped into me.\nMany years ago I had already\nbecome a( devout?) atheist but\nChristianity was the only view that\nwas ever put forward at school\n(hymns and readings from the bible\nin assembly etc).\nLook at evolution and\nChristianity as physical theories\n(which he appears to be inviting\nwhen he says '.. .neither one can be\nproved or disproved.'). I could also\npoint out here that theories cannot\nbe proved, they just work until they\nare found not to work and are thus\ndisproved (in their original form at\nleast). Darwin did not invent\nevolution and then go around\nforcing evidence to fit his belief.\nThis, however, is the action of the\nreligious believer who drops his\ntoast butter side down in the\nmorning and concludes that it is\npunishment for him forgetting his\nprayers the previous evening. One\nimportant aspect of the testing of a theory is the production of supporting evidence. Evidence for\nevolution is all around us (the\ndiversity of life). What evidence is\nthere for Christianity? The bible?\nDeriving predictions and testing\nthem against observation is also\nanother vital process in the\nmethodology of science.\nHypothesis: humanity started\nwith Adam and Eve (Eve being\ncreated from Adam\u2014neat trick,\neh?).\nPrediction? Well, assume them to\nbe white people. We can thus\npredict that all their children will be\nwhite.. .oh dear. We appear to have\na slight problem. Okay, well we can\namend the theory to allow for this\nby including a non-linear term, so,\nthat has the required properties.\nWell, well, after factorisation,\nnormalisation, and taking the real\npart we find that 0=evolution.\nHaving now brought this new\nfunction into the theory we find we\nno longer need the previous\n(hypothesized) boundary condition\n(Adam and Eve at t=0).I apologise to Tom, being ama the metic ian he probably won't appreciate my 'physicist's' proof\n(but it was fun all the same).\nI do envy people like Christians,\nthough. It must be really nice\nhaving this super being watching\nover you, and loving you, and what\na shame it is when people try to\nrock the boat, with these nasty ideas\nabout God not existing. Personally\nI could temporarily suspend my\nrational side (since religion cannot\nbe rational is ed) and agree to the\npossible existence of God, although\nwith it, of course, when one looks\nat the world around us, it's obvious\nhe's a total bloody sadist.\nOops, I think I 've just committed\nblasphemy.\nLG Maskall, Physics 2.\nDear Adam.\nFollowing my Rag Week stunt of\ndying my hair IC colours I would\nlike to take this opportunity to thank\nthe following people.\nBaker Mulligan Hairstylists of King Street Hammersmith for dying\nmy hair, free of charge, over a period of four and a half hours,\nespecially Barbara and Melanie, the\ntwo stylists responsible for the\ndreadful deed.\nDear Adam,\nIn Felix on 11 December, you\npublished a letter from Ben Gladwyn under the heading of 'Run\nOut', in which he wrote that the\nCareers Service had run out of\nStandard Application Forms.\nThe facts are that we reordered\n1000 S A F's from our supplier on\n3 December. Despite chasing on 9th and 13th, we received only 100 on\n19th and 100 on 2 January. In the\nmeantime we had to photocopy\n100's of forms to supplement our\nstock of 300 at the time of ordering.\nWe still await the balance of 800\nwhich we ordered.\nIn his letter Ben also refers to\n'standard application forms in the\nappropriate boxes'. I assume he is\nreferring to the Employer Application Forms. When stocks\nare low, we regularly phone\nemployers and ask them to send\nadditional forms. Some employers\nWella Hair Care for donating the\nnecessary dyes.\nAnd everybody who sponsored\nme or made a donation.\nI have so far collected over \u00a3200\nfor this stunt and money is still\noutstanding. If you sponsored me\nand haven't paid yet please see me\nor pop along to the Rag Office on\na lunchtime and pay there.\nThankyou,\nRachel Mountford, Civ Eng 2.\nrespond quickly, but some only\nsend a few which are rapidly taken,\nand some say that they are unable\nto send us any more bulk copies and\nask us to advise students to phone\nthem individually for copies.\nA possible explanation for this\nsituation is that students are wisely\nspreading their nets wider in their\nsearch for employment at the same\ntime employers have fewer\nvacancies and are trying to limit the\nnumber of applications by making\nit more difficult to get application\nforms.\nI would like to reassure your\nreaders that we are equally\nfrustrated by these problems and\nthat we are seeking to maintain\nadequate stocks of all application\nforms.\nYours sincerely,\nJohn Simpson, Director.\nCareers Advisory Service.\nCareers Forms\n- 4 -\n"

She continued by saying\nthat Mr Keith Reynolds, Head of College Security, had 'moved the\ngoalposts' and was determined to\ncontract out Security and\nMessenger work to outside\ncompanies.\nMr Reynolds was unavailable for\ncomment yesterday, but the Rector,\nSir Eric Ash, defended his position\nsaying that 'no-one would be\nhappier than Keith if an agreement\nhad been reached' and that criticism\nwas 'untrue' and 'unfair'.\nAfter comments from academic\nstaff inferring that communications\nwith administration had become\nvery poor, a series of meetings took\nplace this week. On Wednesday\nevening a meeting was called by Sir\nEric Ash with teaching staff. In the\nmeeting the Rector said that the\npractice of debiting departmental\naccounts by central administration\nwas 'evil' and should not happen,\ndespite allegations from several\nacademics that this occurs and that\nthey have limited information about\nthe state of the accounts for which\nthey are supposed to have\nresponsibility.\nAngus Fraser, the Managing\nDirector of Imperial College, met\nmembers of Physics Department\nStaff yesterday lunchtime. Those\npresent at the meeting also\nexpressed concern about\ncommunications in College and\nsuggested that a senate be set up to\nrepresent views within College. Mr Fraser and the Rector both referred\nto the Board of Studies as the forum\nfor debate but added that ways of improving communication were\nbeing considered.\nRepresentatives of the\nmanufacturing Unions attended\nboth meetings. Sue Sharpe of MSF said it was clear that the\nAdministration regarded only the\nacademic staff of importance at\nImperial College.\nDoctor Taylor Russell, of the\nAssociation of University Teachers.\n( AUT), said that suspicion of and\nanger at administrators is common\nif something goes wrong, whoever\nis really at fault. When asked if\nsup portative industrial action by\nlecturers would.happen if further\nstrikes occurred, Dr Taylor Russell\nsaid it was too premature to say but\nthat support for the strike had been\nwide and many people were upset\nthat colleagues were losing their\njobs.\nHome\nHelp\nHomeless people in London should\nbe able to find a bed for the night\nby phoning Freefone 0800 446 441.\nThe service runs for 24 hours a day.\nProfessor Heinz Wolff, best known\nfor his appearances in BBCTV' s 'Great Egg Race', will be giving a talk next Tuesday 14th January, in\nthe Electrical Engineering department.\nSince 1975, Prof Wolff has held\na number of honorary appointments\nwith the European Space Agency\nand he founded the Institute for\nStudents will now have to produce\ntheir Union Cards for access to the\nUnion building on Wednesday and\nFriday nights. All guests will have\nto be signed into the guest book.\nThe move follows violence last\nterm in the Union Building and\nfears that the fire limit may be\nexceeded during busy nights.\nThe Union President, Zoe Bioengineering at Brunei University\nin 1983.\nThe talk, arranged by ICS EDS( IC Students for the Exploration and\nDevelopment of Space), on his\noutlook for the future of the\nEuropean space programme will\ntake place at 6.30pm in Elec Eng408. All interested persons are\nwelcome.\nHellinger, said the system would\ncontrol overcrowding and would\nallow duty officers to know who\nwas in the Union Building. The\nPresident continued that she\nexpected a little trouble when the\nchecks first came into place but that\nthe system should operate\neffectively after that.\nUnion Cards\n\n"

Your help will be\ngreatly appreciated.\nLast Wednesday a meeting was\ncalled between the academics of the\nCollege and the Rector to discuss\nthe complaints made about the\nCollege administrators. The notification was sent to 600\nacademics in a letter which the\nRector asked to be kept confidential\nwithin their ' community'. A number of those attending who had\nnot directly received the notification\nsaid that the complaints - and the\ncommunity - stretched further.\nOther comments from the few\nacademics who bothered to turn up\nranged from 'Imperial pic sees the\ndepartments as an irritation removing funds from\nAdministration with which to make\nprofit' and 'we are run by a junta'\nto 'we need to keep our heads above\nwater' and T am sure that the\nmanagers intend to support the\nacademic mission; the problem is\none of communication.' The major\ncomplaint was the lack of communication between the centre\nand the departments. The Rector\nreplied that although there were\npresent problems, particularly in the\nimplementation of a college-wide\nfinancial control program, these\nwould come right. He said that the\nestates section of the college had\nbeen in an 'absolute shambles... we\nowned a house in Evelyn Gardens\nwe didn't even know about' and\nadded that the present estates\nmanager, Gordon Marshall, was\nrectifying the situation. 'He is very\ngood at his job - but sometimes\ninsensitive to its effect', he said. As part answer to the communications\nproblem, he said that it was the\nconcern of the 'Network' editor,\nEric Stables, to ease such\ndissemination. He also added that\n'there is no major decision that isn't taken by me - on the advice of the\nMPG'( the Management Planning\nGroup) and that he couldn't act on\nproblems that he didn't know about,\nthat he should be informed of such.\nI don't think Sir Eric was too\namused about members of the\nstudent's union being present. If\nyou have any complaints about how\nthe college is run, you are duty\nbound to inform those who can do\nsomething about it - according to\nthe Rector himself. Useful add res es include: Sir Eric Ash, Rector,\nSherfield 541 (tel 3000); Prof Brian\nColes, Pro-Rector, Sherfield 544\n(tel 6107); Mr Angus Fraser,\nManaging Director, Sherfield 545\n(3003); and Mr Gordon Marshall,\nDirector of Estates, Sherfield 529\n(3402), amongst others.\nOverseas Business\nDear Adam,\nI would like to use this bit of\nspace to thank all those people and\ntheir respective societies who\nhelped to make the 'Overseas\nWeek' such a huge success. The\nmain aims of this event were (a) to\ndraw awareness among all the\nstudents in this college to the large\nmix of cultures and nationalities\npresent and (b) to actually indicate\nthe existence of the Overseas\nStudents Committee (OSC) and its\nrole as one of the major subcommittees within the Union.\nTrying to represent about 25 % of\nthe college population with a group\nof ten people is, as you might\nrealise, a pretty difficult task.\nHowever, the support and interest\nthat was received by all those\nmanning the overseas week stalls\ndefinitely made this task seem more\nrealistic. Although, I did notice that\na majority of those taking interest\nin the stalls were overseas students\nthemselves, I hope some of the\n'home' students did manage to\nenlighten themselves as well.\nIn addition to organising such\nevents, the OS C is the main\nrepresentative body of all the\noverseas students at Imperial\nCollege. In attending various\nexciting meetings at both the college\nunion and the University of London\nUnion as a whole, we aim to\ncommunicate any views and/or\nconcerns that we may receive from\nthe students to the 'decision\nmakers', and where possible\npresent any solutions ourselves.\nAt this moment in time, we are\nparticularly involved in the attempt\nto freeze the constant, rapid\nincrease in Overseas Student fees\nand in trying to establish some\nsolutions to this ongoing problem.\nI assure you that for once, we are\nachieving some success.\nI encourage any student who\nmight have any views on the\noverseas week or the OS C itself to\ncontact any of the present\ncommittee so that we may obtain\nsome more feedback to help us in\nthe future events which we will be\norganising. Speaking of which, our\nmain event of the year; the\nInternational Night, which has been\nan immense success over the past\nyears will take place around college\non 28th February 1992.\nThe event will include a huge\nfood fair; a cultural show and\ncarnival/disco hosted by all the\noverseas societies existing in\ncollege. I definitely hope that more\n'home' students will make an effort\nto attend this event and be able to\nexperience what they missed in the\nOverseas Week.\nOnce again, thanks to everybody\ninvolved with the Overseas Week.\nA special thank you is in order for\nJames Wool ven, Stephane\nSchifflers and the events subcommittee who really ensured the\nsuccess of this event.\nHope to see you at International\nNight!\nYours sincerely,\nGaurang Chadha, OSC Chair.\nMend a Bike \u2022 BICYCLE REPAIRS \u2022 SALES AND HIRE \u2022 NEW AND USED BIKES \u2022 ACCESSORIES OPEN:9.00 am Z.OO pm MONDAY TO SATURDAY\n4-6 Effie Road, Fulham Broadway,\nLondon SW6 ITD\n071-371 5867\nIC STUDENTS 10% DISCOUNT ON ALL ACCESSORIES & SERVICES.

    "content": "Music Felix 921 10 January 1992\nProdigal Sons\nLise Yates\ninterviews Two\nLost Sons.\nFirst Lost Son\nWhere are you from?\nThree of us are from Redcar, in the\nNorth-East, near Middlesborough,\nand the drummers from County\nDurham, but we all met in London.\nSo you're not Irish at all?\nNot at all.\nOh. We thought you were Irish.\nYou tend to tour with Irish bands,\nlike last year you were with An\nEmotional Fish, and now tonight\nyou're with the Pogues and\nStorm.\nYeah, we do, I mean Storm are\nreally good and they haven't got a record deal, and then there's us,\nstuck right in the middle, we'll give\nthem some real music. But the\ncrowds have been really good to us,\nas there's always a large Clash\nelement in the crowds. I mean, the\nClash are a big band in their own\nright, but tonight, Brixton's like\nClash country, isn't it?\nDo you think that Joe Strummer\nwill ever replace Shane?\nNo, no one could replace Shane, but\nStrummer's a sort of a legend, and\nhe really complements the Pogues.\nAnd like there's no other bands that\nStrummer could be in, apart from\nThe Clash and The Pogues, so I think it works really well.\nDo you think, personally, that\nThe Clash will reform?\nYes\nProbably.\nWhy the name?\nIt's mainly because my brother and\nme, we were in the band, writing\nthe songs, and it's something my\ndad said, 'Where's Pete and Phil,\nthose two lost sons?'\nWhat's it been like, supporting\nthe Pogues?\nBrilliant. The best thing is, like, it's our first proper tour going to all\nthese beautiful theatres, like the\nEdinburgh Playhouse. And like\nplaying to all these big crowds, our\nmusic doesn't really work on a small scale.\nIs it only in Britain you've been\nsupporting them?\nYeah, in the main. There's one in\nDublin that we did.\nHow did you get together?\nWell me and my brother we've\nbeen writing together for ever, and\nthe bassist, he's from Redcar, but\nwe met him when we moved down\nto London, in a squat in Kings\nCross, and the drummer, he used\nto be in this club called the\nTimebox, which turned into Hype,\nwhich turned into the Pop Club, at\nthe Bull and Gate in Kentish Town,\nand he used to go down there every\nnight, with people like Jon Beast,\nwho used to run it, he works for\nCarter now, and the drummer and\ntwo other guys who've formed\nWhirlpool. We used to have a beat box, but we always needed a drummer, so we eventually got\nhim, and everything turned out fine.\nSecond Lost Son\nWhat are your influences,\nmusically?\nAll the people in the band are all\npretty similar but different, the\nbassist really loves The Ramones,\nand Blondie, and I 've always been\na big Clash fan, so it's been good\nworking with Joe Strummer, and\nthe Beatles, Rolling Stones, Bob\nDylan. I just like a lot of music.\nCurrently though, I like the Wonder\nStuff.\nFourth Lost Son\nYour Favourite films?\n(We're getting desperate for\nquestions here.)\nBetty Blue, I love, and then there's this old black and white one called\nHarvey, with James Stewart, and\nhe's got this imaginary friend who's this six foot white rabbit.\nWhat do you think of the music\npress?\nWell it doesn't really bother me, I mean it's only one person's opinion\nisn't it? I don't like it when the\njournalists are in bands though.\nWhat's the best piece of advice\nyou've ever been given?\nEnjoy yourself, no matter what goes\nwrong, I mean tonight, like 99% of\nthe people here tonight are here to\nsee the Pogues, and we go on just\nthinking they've not heard of us,\nthat we won't have any friends in\nthe crowd, this is just what we do\nWhat* are your plans?\nWe've already recorded an album,\nwith Pat Collier, who did The\nWonder Stuff's album, and there'll\nprobably be another single in\nJanuary or February, and then\nanother tour, either headlining or\nsupport, and we'll see how it goes.\nAnd then we've got a release in\nAmerica, so we'll be off there.\n(We've run out of questions now.)\nSo, we've established that they're\ngenerally nice blok es to talk to, but\nwhat are they like live? A lot better\nthan in the studio, actually. Quite\nrocky, quite groovy, quite good.\nAnd if they do tour this spring, I'd advise you to go and see them.\nQuite.\n\u2014 8 ~\n\n"

    "content": "10 January 1992 Felix 921 Opinion\nThe Reply\nAngus Fraser, College Managing Director\nall-out strike action on8 th November that community came to\ntheir rescue on 4th December. 'The\nunions' were mere vehicles for a demonstration, not of any sort of self interest, but of the very highest\nmoral principle by the members of\nthat community. And, no doubt,\nwhatever the financial plight of the\nCollege as a whole, privatised\nsecurity is no longer a serious\nrunner. Commerce failed because\nthe place is just too goddam\nfriendly.\nI have to admit to not knowing\nmuch about Imperial. But I have a suspicion that as industry constantly\ntries to renew itself in the face of world competition, just a little of the\nb off in ry which makes it possible\ncomes from behind this college's ugly facades. What better place to\nraise the questions of whether this\nprocess, in the name of the common\ngood, can only proceed by creating\nvictims.\nUntil the collapse of the Soviet\nsystem, such a questions could only\nbe asked at the risk of McCarthy ite\nvictim is ation. To doubt the good\nsense of creating redundancies for\nthe few to help raise productivity\nfor the benefit of the many was to\ninvite a double condemnation. On the one hand it meant being a mindless shop floor militant. On the\nother, to be a traitor\u2014either of the\nStalinist or, its mirror image, the\nTrotskyist sort. But now the go und s of this most British constraint upon\nfreedom of speech have been swept\naway, there is no excuse for silence.\nThe security debacle should\nconcentrate Imperial's collective\nmind. How can it leap to the\ndefence of its own, yet unthinkingly\nsupply the economy as a whole with\nthe means of pursuing 'normal\ncommercial practice'? Our means\nof creating wealth may lag far\nbehind that of Japan or Germany.\nBut this should not distract us from\nthe fact that it is almost\nun imaginably greater even than a generation ago. And surely its need\nfor less and less labour shou d be a benefit to the workforce, not a penalty. The challenge is to\novercome its ruthlessness and share\nits fruits.\nThere are issues here which go to\nthe heart of Imperial's educational\nand research function. Is it too\nmuch to ask for serious debate\nbefore security fades back into the\nfabric?\nMeanwhile, to make a very\nmodest living indeed, the security\nguards don't just have to work\nnights, they have to work daytime\novertime on 42 weekends a year as\nwell. And that, for goodness sake,\nis something we are forced to try\nand defend.\nDear Adam,\nMany people in the College have\nexpressed concern and dismay over\nthe aims and conduct of the current\nsecurity review.\nAs far as the former are\nconcerned, the position has been\nclear-cut from the start. The\nCollege needs to improve its\nsecurity arrangements and it needs\nto do so without increasing its costs.\nThe existing security operation is\nsimply not set up to provide the\nlevel of service, which this complex\nsite requires on a cost-effective, 24\nhours a day, 365 days a year basis.\nThat is not to say that our\nmessengers and security staff are\nnot extremely loyal, conscientious\nservants of the College. No one has\never doubted that. It is just that the\nsystems and working practices upon\nwhich the present operation is based\nare ill-adapted to the requirements\nof the College in the 1990's. Apart from failing to meet our\nminimum cover requirements, the\ncurrent operating system is\nexpensive. University management\nstatistics suggest strongly that we\nare paying substantially over the\nodds for custodial services, as a proportion of total expenditure.\nWhilst we are evidently not as\nbroke as many universities and\ncolleges\u2014thanks to our relatively\ntight management controls\u2014we\ncertainly have nothing to be\ncomplacent about. We need to look\nfor every opportunity to reduce\nnon-academic expenditure and\nimprove services, in order to\nsupport the all important academic\nmission of the College. That is\nsurely the duty of the\nAdministration.\nAfter more than six months of detailed study, we identified a possible way of satisfying both our\noperational and financial criteria.\nWe presented that proposal to the\nUnions on 7th November and have\nbeen in discuss s ions with them since\nthat time, following an extension of\nthe in it it al30 day consultation\nperiod to 8th January. I cannot say\nhere what the outcome of those talks\nwill be. What I can say however,\nis that the management involved\nhave acted throughout in a proper\nand professional manner, as one\nwould expect of any good, caring\nemployer.\nChange is never easy,\nparticularly when it affects\nindividuals and the way they do\ntheir jobs. We are not the first to\ngrapple with these sorts of issues\nand we cannot afford to be the last\nto do so in the university sector.\nYours sincerely,\nAngus Fraser.\nThe Student Unions of Imperial College Present\n\u2022 I Tuesday18 th January \u2022 \u2022 to Saturday i\\\\ February pm.
