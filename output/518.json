    "content": "REVIEWS! Having worked out which is the front\ncover and which the editor's tribute to the Sex\nPistols, the unsuspecting reader turns to\npage 3 of the '80-'81 AP and is greeted by a stark warning of the dangers of 'drifting' into\nhigher education (in type of a size which\nwould do credit to the front page of 'The\nSun').\nBy the time the reader reaches P6 and this\ntime the type is laid longitudinally (nudge-nudge, do I detect Mel Kinkie's influence?)\nHe/she is going to be well aware ofthe pitfalls\nof an ill-considered choice made at the 'A Level Crossroads' following school education. Somewhere the editor found\nsomebody to write about 'Life outside\neducation' (reluctantly admitting that some\nstudents 'Might feel sufficiently attracted to\nthem to join' - The forces or the police!)\nwhich article also includes the broad\ngeneralisation 'Just remember - your degree\nis not to qualify you for any particular job' -still it does highlight the need to face 'reality'\nsooner or later in life and to have the courage\nand foresight to consider what is going to\noccupy your 50-odd post university years.\nMore warnings of drawbacks of IC (and the\nrecourse s available when things go wrong)\nfollow, and the anarchistic streak shows\nthrough again with a snide anti-scholarship\nquip, just to remind the potential applicant\nthat the long-haired, anti-establishment,\nchipped-shouldered, bloody-mindedness of\nthe 60s campuses has lasted through a whole\ndecade - still, such personal views are\ninevitable, till we get an alternative AP!!\nBefore the longest, and to my mind, most\nimportant section 'The Courses', comes more\ninformation, on student media Mr Jarvis,\nwhat happen d to your organ?, College\nentertainment, no mention of the CC Us, or\neven !CU GM s here! arid a page of near\nlavatory humour, to reassure the 'Carry-on'\nfreaks that no potential bog-artist need feel\nconstipated at IC provided he/she has a felt-marker handy... Also appearing on P11 is\n'Shit' the first 4 letter word of the AP!!\nNext is one of the best double pages, with\nexcellent articles on women, gays, and\noverseas students (all of whom must feel\noppressed to various extents). The first\narticle is very accurate though not, I felt,\ncalculated to attract more women to IC, thus\n'improving' the ratio - still, could we, in all\nconscience do this?\nNext follows 'The Union Building and\nCollege Bars' - which is very informative, but\ncontains certain things not all IC students\nwould agree with - 'The Union Bar\nunfortunately still has a certain male\ndominated atmosphere' and on refectories,\n'Despite the high prices, the quality of the\nfood can be disgusting'.(Complete with the\nboycott-poster pigs will full frontal Mooney\npicture - the 'Meal' specially ordered by\nMalcolm Brain for full atrocity effect!)\n'The courses' is next: 33 fact-filled pages\nwritten by students of the College and\nsupplying information understandably absent from the offical college prospectus\nabout inadequacies of examining techniques, staff-student relations, social\nand academic problems etc. It seems a pity\nthough, that some courses have a much more\ndetailed 'write-up' than others and that\nsubsections are not the same from one article\nto the next?!.\nAn article on South Africa starts by\nexamining the 'Pros' of working there, but\nthese seem to be drowned by the subsequent\nPage 11\n'cons', the article concluding: 'Any company\nin S. Africa must operate under the system of\napartheid, and is therefore propping up the\neconomic system of that country'.\nNext follows 'IC Union' (again starting in\ntype rather too large to be easily digested) -again informative, but rather biased towards\nACC at the expense of SCAB, RC C and S CC. The CC Us page is amazingly balanced and\nreasonable, highlighting their crucial function in breaking the ice initially, and even\nadmitting that CC Us are 'Wot to everyone\ntaste'. This page concludes with a note on\nICWA and is marred only by the persistent\nmis punctuating of ' CC Us'( still, if it dissuades\npedants like myself from coming to IC, you\nmay be spared such people in the future...).\nNow follow 11 excellent pages on\naccommodation of all types - although even\nan apology for the depressing air of this\nsection (on p57) fails to allay my concern at\nthe possible counter-productive effects of\nstatements like 'in truth things are pretty bad\nand getting worse'.\nOnly at the 11th hour and 64th page does\nthe sixth-former come face to face with the\neditor 'AP Supremo' Roger Stotesbury. To his\ncredit he got elected ICU Hon Sec before this\nAP came out (what do you mean thats why he\nheld it back?)\nIn conclusion this book contains a wealth\nof information and is visually very attractive\nand extremely well packaged. In order to be\nof maximum value, an AP must from time to\ntime express opinions and inevitably these\nwill be contentious on occasion. While many\nsections (especially 'The courses') owe a lot\nto previous APs, this edition does contain\nmuch that is new and immediately relevant,\nand if only to admire the layout and\npresentation I would urge you to have a look\nat a copy and follow our AP Piper along his\nyellow-brick walkway to a better informed\nfresher entry, and a happier and more fulfilled\nstudent body.\nMick Berry (who's department thinks he's been on a sabbatical this year).\nH RECORD IAN DURY : (Stiff)\nDo it Yourself\nAny resemblance to characters living\nor dead is not meant to be unkind to\nmen in syrups.\nThis message is to be found on the\nlabel of the new Ian Dury album, 'Do It\nYourself, released today, and he is\nright, it does not resemble his previous\nwork at all. In fact, if this had not been\n'The new Ian Dury Album', I wouldn't probably have given it a second listen,\nwhich would have been sad indeed.\n()l course, he had a lot to do; after ' New Boots and Panties', the' Poor Man's Tubular Bells', now eighteen months old, anything less than excellent would meet with disappointment and to be honest, I don't think many Dury fans will like this album first time through. It is definitely a grower, and alter listening to it all last weekend, I'm getting to like it. It is different, has some very good tracks, but I wonder if many people are going to give it the same chance. But enough ol this theorising,' Do It Yourself comes in a pseudo wallpaper sleeve ( DIY get it?) and an inner sleeve with a pictorial' Who' s Who' ol an vh nd v remotely involved with the\nproject. But what about the record, you ask.\nSide one starts with Tn be tweenies', along gentle song which set the musical tone ol the\nalbum. The general style is along the lines ol\n' Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick'( surprisingly not included in the album), sort\nol rock with disco overtones, but not exactly if you see what I mean. 'Q_uiet', as on gol lavatory humour, is the\nbest track on the side, and although the words are all written by Dury. and the music mostly written by guitar keyboards player Chaz Jank el. lhc melody tomes from the Blockheads. 'Prune juice', they sing, 'Oh lovely,\nhim- charming, horrible!', answers Dury. Mmm. A great song, despite this.\n'Don't ask me' lind s Dury pleading innocence: 'Here 1 stand with a doughnut for a brain'. ' Sink My Boats' is an unexciting rocker, but the short ' Waiting for Your Taxi', a prolonged staccato, complete with crowd and engine noises, is very good. 'Tour taxi never\ncomes', laments Duty, and neither does the\nend, or so it seems - it's bound to catch out some DJ or other. Into side two with' This is What We Find\", probably the best track on the album. There is a lot of instrumental on it, a feature of the record as a whole, in contrast to the more spartan' New Boots and Panties'. Dury chatters away engagingly( Why oh why no word sheet?) about DIY and infidelity. Straight into the excellent' Uneasy Sunny Day Hot sy Tots y', which would be sure to\npickup a lot of radio coverage were it not for\nthe base language. It has everything, catchy lyrics, a fast beat you just can' the lp singing along. In' Mischief, Dury quietly tells us all about things he has, or would like to have, done. 'Crawling around people's gardens in the\ndark, touching women walking in Ihe park'; what a strange life he must lead. It runs into' Dance of the Screamers', a bland, boring nothing of a song. The last track is ' Lullaby for Frances', a sort of quasi rag gae number, which demonstrates well Dury' s ability to write a tender song. Just the thing for late night relaxation. So then, an album which may take some getting used to. It's not the Dury we know from' New Boots and Panties' or live perl orman ce s;he' s moving forward, experimenting with new formulae. It doesn't grab you, it gradually dawns on you, each new listening bringing some other facet to\nyour notice. It wont be a classic, but it\ncertainly deserves your attention. Jon Firth "

    "content": "IW HAT'S ON Following the Union Meeting\nheld on Tues 8lh May at which a motion was passed withdrawing\nsupport from the National\nAbortion Campaign (NAC). I have since contacted NAC and\nhave found that many of the\npremises, on which the vote was\ntaken, were untrue. I would like\ntherefore, to put forward the facts\nconcerning NAC and hope that\nthe motion will IJC re-discussed\nwith a full appraisal of the facts by\na wider spectrum of students at\nIC.\nThe NAC supports ali or tion on\ndemand. It nowhere states that it\ncondones 'killing a child within a few hours of its birth'. Abortion\nmeans 'terminating a pregnancy'\n.not killing a child. So if Barry\nAustin and his friends can keep a child in an incubator and allow it\nto live, all well & good, I 've no\nobjections. What NAC and the\nWomens Movement are interested in is the woman's right\nto choose what becomes of her\nbody: that it should be her\ndecision to have a child, not a doctors or the state or the church.\nOnly when women have this right\nwill they be able to take an equal\npart in this society.\nThe present law on abortion\n(1967) requires the con cent of two\ndoctors who feel that continuation of pregnancy would\nendanger the health - physical or\nmental of the woman; injure the\nlives of her children that are\nalready alive or if there is any\nsubstantial risk that the child\ncould be severely handicapped.\nNAC is certainly opposed to\nprofiteering by abortions. All legal institutions performing\nabortions do so only under\nscrutiny of the NHS. BP AS and\nPAS are both registered\nchair it ics, ie non-profit-making,\ncharging /75-80 for an early\nabortion, \u00a3130 for a later one.\nThis sum is considerably less than\nfor a full term baby. NAC( unlike\nLIFE and SPUC) campaign for\nresearch into pregnancy testing,\ncontraception and safe methods of\nabortion.\nThe main argument at the\nmeeting was 'late' abortions (after\n16 weeks). In 1974 0.8% of all\nali ort ions in England and Wales\nwere performed after 20 weeks,\nthe majority lor medical reasons.\nAnother point was that of DayCare abortions. There are at\npresent 12 Day-Care units run by\nNHS in Britain. This type of\nabortion enables women to have\ntheir terminations at an early\nstage of pregnancy (up to 12\nweeks) with the minimum of\ndelay or imposition of a heavy\nstrain on either nursing stall or\nNHS financial resources (^35 as\ncompared to \u00a3112 for overnight -costed in 1977 in Tower\nHamelts). The woman stays in the\nhospital clinic for about 4-5 hours.\nShe is not allowed to leave the\nhospital alone and is advised to\nhave a friend or relative to stay\nthe night in case of complications.\nIn a2 year trial monitored by\nDHS S( ended June 1978) B PAS and PAS( London) carried out\nmore than 10,000 day-care\nabortions without mishap. Councelling and as semen t is\ngiven beforehand.\nI hope this has clarified the\nsituation and I hope further\ndiscussion on the topic will\nconcern itself with facts and not,\nas happened at the meeting, with\nuninformed biassed opinions. The fundamental difference between\nNAC and its o ppen ents is that\nNAC allows people the opportunity to have their own belief without imposing them on\nothers.\nIn conclusion we know that\nChristians and Barry Austin\nbelieve life is sacred, but isn't the\nquality of life important too?\nMerche Clark Maths 2\nDear Sir, - As two occasional\nreaders of FELIX, we find it\nsurprising that the Editor has now\nstooped so low as to devote two\ncomplete columns to the petty\nself-indulgent ramblings of Mr Barry Austin.\nWe can fully und est and now\nafter reading such self-centred\nchildish ranting s in your columns,\nthe reactions of students of other\nLondon Colleges on hearing the\nname Imperial College. It is now\nobvious that the high academic\nstanding is not matched by the\nmaturity of its students.\nWe can only hope that, like us,\nMr Austin is a third year student,\nso that future students will not be\ntreated to such depressing rubbish\nagain.\nYours sincerely,\nChristopher C Bose Chem III\nNicholas P Fitzhugh Elec Eng III\nDear Sir, - It is nice to know that\nIC students enjoy fresh air and\nsunshine but shameful that such\napparently intelligent people are\nso selfish and inconsiderate as to\nleave their litter for all in Beit\nQuad to bear with every time we\nhave good weather. I'm sure that\nall the people who carry their\nmeals and drink out into the quad\nare capable of carrying their\nempties to an appropriate rubbish\nbin.\nLR M Dawson,\nZoology\nDear Sir, - I feel that I must write\nabo out the last ICU GM, held on\nTuesday May8 th. The first\nmotion, proposed by Mr B Austin, was totally negative\nshowing no positive alternative to\nthe withdrawal from NAC, and then as if this wasn't bad enough\nthe first amendment was even\nmore negative, withdrawing all\nFRIDAY 18th May\nCONCERT\nIC CHOI R Concert - 8.00pm, Great Hall.

But when she heard that the\nmeeting would not be discussing policy and there would not be another\nmeeting until the end of June she withdrew her motion to Monday's ICU\nCouncil meeting.\nAbortion will again be discussed at the Union meeting next Tuesday\nand Ms Attenborough hopes that the decision not to support the NAC\nwill be amended.\nCouncil met on the lawn in the pleasant surrounds of Silwood. Other\nitems on the agenda were less controversial.\nMembers accepted a proposal that ICU should tentatively agree to\nhost the International Conference of Student of Technology two years\nfrom now. This is a conference, largely sponsored by industry, to which\nthe Union sent three representatives this year.\nAs a result of discussions at that conference Council agreed to set\nup a Union Committee to help students find training places and jobs\nabroad.\nAnother body set up by Council is a Union Safety Committee. This\nhas become a legal requirement and Council also accepted a Union\nSafety Policy drawn up by its own resident safety expert Bernard Smith.\nPrompted by the Union Permanent Working Party Council accepted a number of suggestions to improve student interest in Union meetings.\nAmong these are an ICU stall at Frehsers' Fair, a printed guide to Union\nmeetings and an attempt to ensure that other meetings or classes do not\nclash with Union meetings.\nA new task given to the P WP is the revision of the Union Policy\nDocument in an attempt to bring it up to date.\nCouncil Members on the Lawn al Silwood Park\nIt was agreed that four more Union office-holders should be offered\nrooms in hall next year. These are the SCAB Chairman, the Union\nPublicity Officer, IC Radio Station Manager and the Overseas Students'\nCommittee Chairman.\nBecause of the difficulty of finding a departmental representative for\nManagement Science where most of the students are postgraduates on\none year courses Council decided to move the election for this post to\nthe autumn term.\nthe most controversial item discussed by Council was whether there\nshould be a barrel of beer at the Joint Council meeting in June. The\ndecision was to provide one.\nFinally Council adjourned to a quiet country pub nearby, took over\nthe premises and drank their entire stock of Director's bitter.\nNEWS IN BRIEF ART COLLEGE PLEA\nThe Royal College of Art has\na^ ain complained to IC Union\nabout IC students using their\nrefectory. They are asking\nstudents not to eat there before\n1.00pm or they will be forced to\ninstitute rard checks.\nNO GO\nStan has appealed to people not\nto remove gals ses from his bars in\nSouthside. Glasses should not be\ntaken further than the lounge and\nrefectory areas.\nHe is trying to cut the heavy\nloss of beer glasses and hopes\nstudents will co-operate. IC\nUnion has given support to his\ndecision.\nEXPLOSIVE OCCASION\nThe sun shone brightly on IC's wind orchestra at their annual\nopen air lunchtime performance\nin the shadow of the Queens\nlower on Tuesday.\nHighlight of the occasion was\nTehaikovski's1812 symphony\nac rom pained by explosives\ndetonated on the lower balcony\nand the pealing of the bells.\nFIRE STOPS LIFT\nA fire in the engine room of the\nUnion Building lift on Tuesday\nhas put the lift out of action. No\nfurther damage was caused.\nMORE SEX CALL\nThe Union's Academic Affairs Committee is calling for the\nUnion Office to be turned into a brothel and for an associated studies course in' sexual affairs'.\nIn a motion to Council the\nCommittee stated their belief in a direct relationship between sex\nlife and academic attainment. They also proposed the replacing of permanent Union stall by sex\nadvisers. But Council refused to discuss\nthe motion at its last meeting, preferring a speedy adjournment to the pub. Academic Affairs Officer RogerS totes bury revealed however that the main purpose of the motion was to\nattract media attention. NO ALTERNATIVES\nThe Union's Social Clubs Committee has rejected an application by a group named' Post it ive Alternatives to Abortion'( PATA) to become a Union society. PATA had intended to campaign against abortion and to offer help to girls\nbecoming pregnant. Barry Austin, PAT A's founder, is very angry at the decision. He has accused S CC of acting un constitutionally', but was unwilling to explain his charge. He also claims that he was refused\na right of reply to points raised during the discussion.S CC Chairman Frank James told FELIX that PATA had been rejected because its aims were in part already covered by the\nwelfare service and Women's Association. Mr Austin had refused to limit PAT A's activities to campaigning and would not accept amendments to its constitution to comply with the\nrequirement that different societies' aims must not overlap. Rejecting Mr Austin' s charges Frank James said that the\ndecision did not contraveneS CC standing orders and that the\nmeeting had spent 1 1/2 hours discussing the matter which he\nfelt was adequate time for\neveryone to make their positions clear. DISPUTE THREAT\nCollege technicians arc dissatisfied with College's progress in carrying out the terms of January' safety agreement and another dispute is possible.\nThe IC branch of the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs,\nASTM S, is claiming that College has not complied with the\nagreement which ended the 10\nweek dispute last winter. The Union has given College a week It)\nprovide evidence of progress on safety.\nThe branch is also asking College to give reasons for their termination of the employment of branch Chairman Arthur Sier. Mr Sier is an ASTM S National Executive Committee member and chief negotiator with the\nuniversities on technical staff\nmatters. His conditions of\nemployment, permitting him to\ncarry out his Union functions, were laid down in an agreement between IC's former Rector Lord Penney and ASTM S National Secretary Clive Jenkins. ASTM S members area noye d that College acted without consulting their Union. An ASTM S meeting on Tuesday decided that if College did not reply to these two matters a branch meeting would be called next week at which the Chairman would propose entering into dispute with the College. NOT ENOUGH ROOM\nSo many3 rd year students have applied lor hall places that there will be almost no room for 2 nd year new applicants. Final year students have priori ly over2 nd years and166 have applied lor the 163 places available to both years.\nThe tJ ni on is to write to all3 rd year new applicants suggesting lli a lih cy might form groups lo occupy t he new Hats at 9 Princes Gardens which will be ready in October.

Bathed in a solitary amber spotlight\nin the empty black expanse of the Odeon,\nthey sang songs with titles like 'Double\nYellow lines'. They were basically very\npleasant; Gay having a good voice reminiscent of Annie Haslam's and playing a strange instrument like a stringed vegetable\nmarrow, which required elaborate tuning\nbetween songs. Her husband on guitar\nseemed unable to control his volume,\nhowever, and blurted emphasis on completely unsuitable words in the middle of\nlines.\nThe audience was fairly uniform i ly dressed\nin tidy jumpers and cords, not a studded\njacket in sight, and showed their restlessness\nbetween acts merely by politely applauding\ntwo roadie s and the safety curtain.\nBehind me sat a group of Germans, talking\nloudly. All I could translate was the following\nenigmatic exchange.\n7 have seen them before. They have a piano'.\n7, however, prefer Alice Cooper.'\nI think the reply was 7 think Mickey Mouse\nis better.', but probably my sub^O level\nGerman missed the subtleties of this\nexchange.\nRenaissance came on after a short interval.\nAnne Haslam, the lead singer, swirled and\nbopped, on the spot, hands on hips, and\nRenaissance were soon into an enjoyable\nmixture of old favourites and recent releases.\n'Prologue', 'Mother Russia', 'Song for all\nSeasons' and especially 'Northern lights',\nwere all included and recognised with wild\napplause, but Renaissance enthusiasts will\nhave missed 'Ocean Gipsy' and 'Running\nHard'. Also, only one track from ICONCERT\n\u2022 W l kl Of lMS MCMUXXIX\nRenaissance live at Hammersmith Odeon, Friday May 11th. 'Scheharazade' was featured, but this was\nwise as it sounds best with an orchestra.\nAnnie seemed apologetic about the new\nsongs introduced into the act. This he s it ance invited a murmur from the audience.\n'Oyl' she said with her famous recurring\nlaugh, We Ve got to include some new songs\nyou know'.\nAs bass guitarist Jon Camp remarked,\nRenaissance songs take inspiration from\ndiverse sources (Solzhenitsyn, The flood of\nLyons, Scheharazade), but none stranger\nthan 'Secret Mission'. This Jon warned, was\ncomposed to alleviate the boredom induced\nby an American James-Bond type film, but\n'Secret Mission' turned out to be very good.\n'This is our latest single, just released.\ndeclared Annie, later. A lone voice cheered in\nthe fifth row.\n\"Oh, so you're the one who bought it!' she\nsaid, laughing again.\n(There was a slight pause as the Germans\nexplained this witticism to each other, then\nlaughed incongruously thirty seconds after\neveryone else.)\nThe climax of the performance was the\nencore. 'Ashes are Burning', one of\nRenaissance's most popular tracks. Annie\nHaslam cooed melodically over John Tout'sst a cat to piano double octaves, and Jon Camp burst into a double necked guitar solo. The\nwhole track was very exciting and blossomed\ninto spectacular overkill as plumes of fire and\nsmoke fire worked upward from the front of\nthe stage, the audience swept with beams of\nlight sparkling off the Odeon's obligatory\nmirror-globes at the rear. The music got\nlouder, Annie sang higher, and as glorious\nmellotron chords died away, the group\nsurged down off their various instruments to\nshake hands with the delighted front row.\nGreat Stuff. Paul W nii ams Physics II\n[RECORDS\nSingles Review:\nLeigh Foster\nThe first exhibit in this case is a record by\nthe Clash, to wit the new single by them. It is\na cover version of Sonny Curtis T fought the\nlaw'. This is the second cover song they have\nreleased as a single recently, if they don't cool\nit soon they'll end up like the Shadows. Their last attempt, on English Civil War was much\nbetter, having at least some ofthe venom of\ntheir earlier songs, but this song hangs sadly\nempty., (Tris says 'yeahh') Anyway I think if\nJoe Strummer is running out of ideas for\nsongs maybe he should take a vacation.\nExhibit B is a record called ' I'm Hanging Around', and it is by the Leyton Buzzards. It\nis nothing like ' Hanging Around' of\nStranglers fame, but stands up on its own as a really listen-to-able disc. It is an everyday\nstory of teenage love, told a little more\nconventionally than Jilted John. This blok e fancies a nice girl and is thrilled to be the one\nshe chooses out from the local lads, but then\nshe turns nasty on him, but of course his love\nis true and I could go on all day but time,\nspace and sore lingers prevent me.\nIf you would care to examine the next\nexhibit with great care not to get too close, for\nfear of contamination. It is a disco version of,\nwait for it, no not the song of Solomon, that's been done. No this piece of putrescent plastic\nattempts to disc of y the anthem of the New Wave 'Sex and Drugs and Rock and Rolf Possibly Ian Dury's Meistcrverk, or possibly\nnot. The facts, M' lud, are as follows: the\ngroup of people known as Patrick Duvet and\nhis Sweet Perversions have put out a record\ncalled ' Le Sex, Le Draques et Lc Rock' n' Roll'. The song is not, as you might\nexpect, in French, it is just a twee and\nunnecessary failure to cash in on someone else's genius. I know there are those of you out there saying' Well it is only a bit of fun, a joke.' Well really! is nothing sacred? Environmentalists note:- as a12 \"disc this is\nan even bigger waste of plastic. Finally, and in conclusion, I would like to\nput it to the Court that there has been a distinct lack of original singles this week. To substantiate this claim I present Exhibit D;a Rock and Roll Love Letter from the Records( a cruelly confusing name they have there).\nAs the hoppers among you will re me ber. this\nwas done millen i a ago by the sunk without t racc Bay CJity Rollers. Actually has a few redeeming properties, most of which are due to the song rather than the band. All in all this week has been what we in the recke red industry call' quiet'. Poor I CRat lio have a hard task be lore I he m to lind some good stud to play you, but remember this, the goodies always win in the end.' Bye now. "

Social colours went to 30 people who were considered to have\nmade a special contribution to Union life this year. These\ninclude Liz Lindsay and Rae Snee, and exceptionally a non'\nUnion member, Annie Lathaen, one of the IC Union staff.\nR CSU President Chris Fox received a Union General Award ex-oli iei o. He also presented awards to Sean O 'Boyle and Jerry Swain to\nreward their exceptional service to R CSU. The Dervck Bond Memorial Award went to Andy French. This is a lavatory seat which he has to wear round his neck at RCS bar nights.\nMeanwhile the three chefs. Barney McCabe, Jim Sarsfield and DakH o ward, were adding such choice delicacies to the initiation mix as\nassorted fish organs, mashed raw potatoes and\" Mrs. Watsons amazing\nMalaysian prawns\" Ingredients were limited only by the constraint\nthat the v had to be or once hare been edible. \"\nMark Corrigan Handing his Gown to Jo Armitage\nRSM\nHow closely the final \"mystery\ningredient\" truly fitted that\ndescription was perhaps debatable. The liquid had been\ndonated by an RCS student and\nwas not unconnected with human\nreproduction.\nThe initiation procedure was\nnot without its unscheduled\nmishaps. To obtain the bull's blood the chefs had journeyed to\nWatford abattoir, but confusion\nabout the relative locations ol\nWatford and the Watford Gap meant that they drove almost as\nfar as Nottingham before they\nrealised that they might have\ngone slightly too lar up the Ml. The initiation started with the\nnew executive of Sean O 'Bovle.\nTansy Hepton and Mo Misra\nimbibing a beer and milk mixture\nout of the three-handled pot.\nThen the three were painted in\nblack. white and lilac.

The curtain went\nup and the trousers came down. In\nfront of Beethoven and\nArchimedes, who were turned to\nstone by the whole affair, the\nfemale orifice of the year award\nwas presented to Tony Dean.\nPat Leggett, inflated by being\nnamed Johnny Of The Year, burst\nhis trophy.

The\nobvious course for him is to promote a Labour back-ben cher, returned on May 3rd with a substantial majority, to the House of\nLords and so create a by-election in a safe\nLabour seat for which Mrs Williams could be\nnominated.\nMr Callaghan must consider the pre c ident when Mr Gordon-Walker lost his seat in 1964\nas Labour MP for Smethwick.

He\ndisinfected his room, draped sterilised sheets\nover his body, swallowed barbiturates for\nanaesthesia and performed the operation\nwearing sterile gloves and a surgical mask.\nLooking into strategically placed mirrors,\nhe began by cleansing his abdomen with\nalcohol, and made an incision with a scalpel,\nand the dissection carried out with surgical\ninstruments. After eight hours he had to give\nup because of unexpected pain in retracting\nhis liver. Exhausted, he bandaged his\nwound and called the police.

Etemadi (Phys I),534 Novices 3rd Chess Club This year's chess club championship was won convincingly by Phil\nMaguire with five and a half out of six, a full point ahead of Shayin\nRouhani and Bob Coles who tied for second place. The tournament was\ndistinguished by some pretty atrocious play with several people\ncompeting for their first IGP (International Grand-Patzer) norm. After\nstiff competition from Jitesh Gajjar, who contrived to lose to Maguire in\nnine moves, this dubious honour went to Pete Anderson for consistently\nbad play throughout the event.\nMore respectable chess was produced by the two teams in the\nMiddlesex league. After two fine 6-0 wins at the end of the season the\nsecond team are certain of promotion from the 4th division and may win\nit. Many fine individual performances included 4/4 from Jitesh Gajjar on\nboard I and 7/8 from Steve Madden on Board 3. The final position of the\nfirst team is still in doubt but it looks likely that it will be promoted to the\nPremier Division.\nFinally, in the 3rd Middlesex team tournament, held at ICU over\nMay Bank Holiday, the IC team put in a fine performance with 13/24\nwhich included a superb win over pre-tournament favourites Kings\nHead. In this 3rd round match British Champion(l) Jonathan Speelman\ncould make no progress against accurate defence by Maguire and a draw was agreed. On board two Jon Freeman lost narrowly to\nInternational player David Goodman whilst Pete Anderson and Chris\nCallow both scored brilliant wins against their opponent, Whiteley and\nHillyard who again are players of national calibre.\nA fine finish to a very successful season. Steve Madden\n1 FOOTBALL Charing Gross Hospital II 2 : 4 IC V IC Vths in late late title bid\nAt the start the omens looked bad for the fifths when their\ncaptain AI Cable failed in an early attempt to score before the\ngame started (ie offering two young girls a lift on the way to the\nground ' Room for two more inside girls', but being refused).\nWhen the match actually started the Vths quickly took a deserved\nlead when a hopeful lob by Mark Clegg found Damian Kelly clear in\nfront of goal and he gave the keeper no chance with a well placed shot.\nThe fifths followed up this early success with another goal, from a corner. First Phil Lakin won the ball in the air and directed it to Paddy\nO' Kelly who headed the ball across goal for Clive Whiteside to head\n(Yes, it definitely was Clive Whiteside).\nThe play, however, was not all\nconfined to one end. Charing Cross had already twice been very\nclose to scoring when they hit\nSteve Veat's near post with first a thundering free-kick and then a wickedly flight ed shot. And it\ncame as no surprise that Steve wag\neventually beaten when a skilful\nCharing Cross winger burst into\nthe penalty area and tucked a neat shot just inside Steve's near\npost.\nThis served to spur the fifths to\ngreater efforts and after several\nshots had been well saved they\nwent further ahead from another\ncorner. This was taken by Brian\nEdmundson on the right, and\nflicked back by James Rowley to\nAl Cable who made no mistake\nwith this opportunity to score.\nThe fifths now started to take a strong grip on the game and due\nto some excellent mid field work\nwere unlucky not to have added\nfurther to their lead before half-time. A further goal did occur\nmidway through the second half\nwhen MoM isra, in true Kenny Dalglish style, darted in between\nthe full-back and goalkeeper to\nscore a superb opportunist goal.\nFrom this point IC were in\ncomplete control of the game but\nwith three minutes left the\nsubstitution of John Healy for MoM isra served only as a spur to\nCharing Cross. And with the last\nkick of the game (so to speak)\nCharing Cross scored with a fine\nnear post header, which gave\nSteve Veats no chance.\nThis must go down as an\nemphatic team victory in which it\nwould be difficult to single out\nparticular players in a performance to which all the\nplayers contributed greatly; but\nDennis Cook and Steve Veats\nmust receive special credit.\nDennis for allowing the player he\nwas marking to soc re both goals\nbecause 'He was such a pleasant\nblok e', and Steve for believing his\n'Dracula' tag by not only\ncatching but holding every cross\nhe went for.\nTeam:- Steve Veats, Brian\nEdmundson, Dennis Cook, Phil Lakin,\nAl Cable, Damian Kelly, Clive\nWhiteside, Mark Clegg, James\nRowley, Mo Misra, Paddy O 'Kelly.\nsub John Healy.\nCHOCOLATE\"\nCflSAMEL.\nIb rTE E*'<H \u00a3 W AY, VIE CAtf MOW TEXk.

C.1st XI\nThe day started badly with\nthe key members of the I.C. side stranded in The Orange\nTree in Richmond whilst the\nother half of the team\nconducted an in-depth survey\nof the Richmond one-way\nsystem. Somehow by 3pm there were nine members of\nthe l st XI at QJEC's ground.\nThis did not include skipper\nToplis who was stranded in\nRichmond Park having erotic\nfantasies about deer.\nWe were forced to start without him and Morton heroically assumed the roles of skipper and opening bowler. To pl is soon arrived and immediately brought himself on to bowl in place of the ferocious looking Morton. To pl is managed to collect4 lucky wickets for 25 runs by such dubious means as hit wicket. Meanwhile My fva gana m had produced the flattering figures of114. Eventually To pl is was forced to\nresort to IC's battery of spinners who are note able more for their numbers than an v ability to spin the ball. Price127, Fi field25, and Care01 all gave the batsmen a chance to find the short leg-side\nboundary. Luckily QE C cannot boast too much in the way of batting. The IC fielding was up to its\nnormal standard. Fi field managed to run out the batsman vs. I. C.1st XI\nat the non s trick er's end by accidentally deflecting a straight drive with his foot on to the\nstumps. Morton dropped an impossible chance on the boundary. He normally hangs on\nto such chances, but on this\noccasion he was in severe danger of impaling himself on a wooden fence. However, the fielding highlight of the afternoon must have been Price's acrobatic attempts to avoid a full blooded pull to square leg. The look on his\nface matched the brown stain on his flannels.\nThe net result of all this\nfri vol itv was that QE C finished at\n84 all out.\nTo pl is' s only good decision of the day was to allow Morton and Fi field to open the batting. This elegant pair had soon knocked off\nthe first 70 runs before Fi field finally managed( at the sixth attempt) to throwaway his wicket so that he could make it to Kings Cross for a train. This allowed Everett( bidding for the Sam Heath Ugliest Man in the Club Award) to come in and score a streaky8 n.o. Morton moved on to 41 before generously lobbing a catch to mid off when we were three runs short of victory. This left My lv aga nam to score a faultless 0 n.o.

ICRICKET\n_ 2 0 3 6 Dec\n33 all out\nOlympians 132 all out\nIC Sunday XI 75 for 9\nMatch Drawn\nFor i he first time this season\nFurnish lost the toss, and\nOlympians elected to bat on a soft\ngreen wicket. 30 minutes later, at\n14 for 3, the decision looked a mistake but Olympians pulled\nback to 52, when the combined\nsubtle moves of bringing on\nspinner Slator and balding old\nman Hallett, who clearly had the\nopposition beaten with raw pace,\nreduced them to 92 for 7.\nThey finally made 132 all out.\nIC started well with Stantiford\nmaking the bowling look worse\nthan it was, and the wicket look\nbetter than it was. He went for 21\nwith the score on 23 (2 byes) and\nthe wickets began to tumble due\nto a combination of good bowling,\nbad batting, and a very uneven\nbounce. The draw was finally\nsaved primarily by a patient 17 not\nout from Ellacott who was there\nfor about 25 overs, and was well\nsupported for 9 overs for the final\nwicket by Crowe who, having\nbeen ICs outstanding bowler with\n4 for 21, batted for probably the\nbest 0 not out he will ever get.\nCertain IC players appeared to\nbe holding a prayer meeting in the\npub afterwards but were asked by\nthe landlord to cease their\nmediation s. To give the opposition credit,\nPatel batted well.\nTeam:- Furnish, Tomlinson, Stantiford, Ellacott,\nChadband, Slator, Acford, Hallett, McLellan.\nCrowe, Davis,\nWill all ACC Clubs note that\nonly expenditure that has been\npreviously cleared with John Stocks will be allowed after the\n30th May. IC 2nd XI\nKings 2nd XI\nImprovement at last! This time we actually had the Minibus keys, but\nthe Minibus seemed to lack an engine. Failing to be discouraged, the\nteam clambered into a red cattle truck, which was adroitly backed out of\nthe parking lot by driver Acford, despite gaining an extra coat of yellow\npaint on the way.\nThe bright sunshine obviously affected skipper Furnish, who\nproceeded to toss up with the Kings 1st XI captain. When this was\neventually pointed out to him, he shuffled across to the other pitch,\nmuttering 'we would have beaten them an way' and won the toss. FirstXI\nimport Everett and third XI reject Kendrick opened the batting, and put\non 34 before Kendrick was beaten for pace by a medium pacer, and\ncomprehensively bowled. Cowboy Care, encouraged by his\nperformance the previous week, played an atrocious shot, and sliced a half volley to deep mid off. 'Spark Plug' Furnish came in to join Everett\nwith the score on 44, and with a variety of mis hits and edges from\nFurnish at one end, and some majestic stroke play from the little man at\nthe other end, this pair of unlikely lads put on 130 before Everett was\nbowled for an amazing 110.\nNow was the obvious time to\ndeclare, but with the captain on\nfor a fifty, this seemed unlikely.\nDespite deliberately running out\nthe luckless 'Taffy' Salter, he was\nout for 47. McGuire fell next ball,\nso the declaration was delayed to\ngive the bowler a chance of a hat\ntrick (and a jug). The pad less Acford loped out to join Ellacott,\nwho, not knowing the rules ofthe\ngame, ho ike d the next ball over\nsquare leg.\nWith Kendrick and the still limp\nDean suffering from a surfeit of\nsandwiches, IC opened with the\nnaked pace of Ellacott, and the\nmore cultured pace of Wyatt.\nKings were soon 5 for 3, thanks to\ntwo fine catches held by Salter\nand Furnish. A magnificent\npartnership of 16 then developed,\nbetween two batsmen who refused to be intimidated by either\nbouncers or sarcasm. Finally\nEllacott pitched a ball on line, and\nuprooted leg stump. Wyatt was\nreplaced by Ac ford, who produced two amazing overs of\nviciously straight full tosses. One\nunfortunate batsman actually hit\none to our resident spin-bowler,\nwho dropping his daisy chain,\nthrew the ball to Acford in true\ncowboy style. Acford, rumoured\nto have been selected for his\ndriving abilities, showed a vast\namount of co-ordination and\ndeflected the ball onto the stumps\nfor a creditable run-out.\nThe spin attack having been\nthereby roused, was brought on to\nbowl, gaining one wicket, and so\nfrightening the batsmen that\nWyatt was able to mop up the\nremaining rabbits next over,\nsimply by bowling straight. Kings\nfinal total was 33,10of which were\nextras, giving a final result of\nvictory by 170 runs, and enabling\nEllacott to take 4 for 5.\nMcGuire,\nTeam:- Furnish (Captj, Everett, Kendrick, Care, Salter\nEllacott, Acford, Wyatt, Vincent, Dean.\nIC 2nd XI 86 all out\nQEC 2nd XI 31 all out\nIC won by 55 runs\nWinning the toss on a fine, dry day against a side who already bore the\nmark of cowboys, IC elected, not surprisingly, to bat.\nQueen Elizabeths attitude of'couldn't care less' on the field seemed to\nwork its way through to Furnish and Tomlinson who were soon back in\nthe pavilion to make the score 21 for 2. Wyatt fol owed shortly\nafterwards, given Ibw to a ball 2 feet wide, to enable the Queen Elizabeth\numpire to run off the field to the loo. To make amends the opposition\ncaptain then instructed him to give an equally bad decision in our\nfavour, giving Acford, who made 20, and helped in a partnership with\ntop scorer Salter (21), not out when he was on 0. IC finally made 86.\nAfter a stern tea time lecture soon as Acford, at the other end,\nbegan to bowl on the stumps, the\nwickets fell, and he finished with a remarkable (I still don't believe it)\n7 for 15, including aha trick. QE C were finally all out for 31.\nAcford should have bought 4\njugs; 1 for 5 wickets, 1 for aha trick,1 for his first ever\nboundary, and 1 for his first ever\nscore in double figures, but tight-fist ed ly he supplied 1 jug only.\nfrom the IC captain on the low\nstandard of the previous weeks\nfielding, and on the undesirability\nof being beaten by such a team, IC\nfielded with some vigour.\nA fine Tomlinsqn throw ran out\nan opener on the 3rd ball of the\ninnings and the following ball saw\nWyatt have the next batsmen\ncaught by Stean at leg slip. As\nTeam: Furnish, Tomlinson, Acford, Wyatt, Mahers, Heath, Clothier,\nSalter, Stean, Roche, Graham.\n\n"

Within the next three weeks the\nfinal Rag total of the year will be\nmade known.\nMARA NATHA IN THE BEGINNING EXISTENCE WITH MEANING! Man is God's creation. The Christian understanding of man must begin here. According to Christianity, man is not just a collection of chemicals that came into being by an intricate\nprocess and then evolved mind and consciousness. Man owes\nhis whole being, his physical vitality and his spiritual\naspirations, to God from whom all life derives. His existence is\nno chance or accident.\nThe early chapters of Genesis describe creation in evocative pictorial\nlanguage, more akin to poetry than science. The whole natural order,\nthe primaeval energy, the earth, the sea, the plants, the animals, and\nfilial lyman himself, are declared to be the work of God, and good. God is described as forming man from dust and breathing into him, giving\nhim life. That is to say, it is God who has designed man to be what he is:\nthinker, artist, scientist, builder; above all, worshipper. Man's enormous creative capacity comes from the Creator. The most creative\nact of all is a response to him.\nThe Christian doctrine of creation isn't concerned with the biological\ndetails of man's origin. That is the proper field of study for the zoologist\nand anthropologist. But Christianity does assert that by whatever\nmeans man has come into being, it is the work of God. The theory of\nUNIVERSITY OF LONDON UNION\nUL U exists believe it or not (in Malet St - halfway between Goodge St.\nand Russell Sq tube stations). It is a large building containing facilities\nfor Sports, Societies and various other things. It s bar is not too bad (if\nyou like Stella).\nBut UL U is THREATENED. The students in the largest university\nin Europe are not using facilities provided for them. While appreciating\nthe facilities at IC, many students live away from College in North\nLondon or Intercollegiate Halls and are closer to UL U. So, think,\npeople and ACT. Also UL U is the place where we at IC can meet students in non-scientific disciplines from other colleges. They are in the same\nuniversity as ourselves, they are also fellow students they might even\nlike to meet scientists from IC.\nUL U is in danger of closing. Due to the shortage of buildings in\ncentral London and the lack of use of the UL U building there is a distinct possibility of the Senate of the University requisitioning the\nbuilding for University purposes and this is not just a threat, they will\ndo it.\nIf you would like to find out more about UL U, there will be an open\nmeeting of the External Affairs Committee at which Jeremy Hyde,\nPresident of UL U will speak on the future of UL U. The meeting is in\nthe Green Committee Room at 7 pm on Thursday17 th May.\nFailing that, see Mary. Barry Austin, Chris Webb or myself through the\nUnion Office.\nJohn Passmore\nExternal Affairs Officer\nevolution is at present generally considered to be the best description of\nthe development of living things that science can give, though like all\nscientific theories, it is open to criticism and will need modification as\nnew evidence comes to light. But at best it is only a description ofthe\nprocess. The belief of Christians is that, whatever the process, the\nauthor is God. From\" What is Human?\" T.M.K it wood. IV P. "

Firstly, Imperial\nCollege, with a Henley win behind them, and recent experience\nof competing at National level at the ARA's Nottingham\nmeetings. Secondly, UCH, strong in college rowing, but,\nseldom noted elsewhere. Finally, QM C, who had 'persuaded'\nseveral of their men rowing in the UL U squad to turn out for\nQM C on the day.\nConditions were good, and were only spoiled by a few\nbrainless motor launch drivers who caused several near\naccidents.\nTHE EVENTS OPEN SCULLS Chris 'Bomber' Howell beat QM C/UL superstar\n' Donny' Hill, and is continuing his bid to rise from novice to elite in one\nyear.\nCOX LESS PAIRS Alan Cooper and Colin Southall's meteoric and\nerratic start so unnerved Mr Hill and his companion that they gave up\nwithin 50 y rds ofthe start.

Mr Hill didn't enter this one because of his elite\nstatus...\nCOX LESS FOUR S... but he was allowed to row in this event. It didn't do him much good, however, as the IC boat, which had been competing\nwith National Squad crews the previous weekend, took nearly two\nlengths oil' QM C over this short course.\nThe victorious IC Eights\nOPEN EIGHTS THE ALL OM CUP Here. IC was the meat in the\nsandwich between QM C and\nUCH.

Nijmegen. Then off into the night, through a corner of Germany, across\nthe Rhine and back into Holland up to Dinxperlo where we arrived at\nabout 04.00, ten stages having been completed, with the Impalas in 4th place out of the 75 teams which had started at midnight.\nUncomfortably close behind were Surrey University in 5th. Martin Tarnowski after overtaking Surrey during leg 6, took a wrong turn and\nlost them again. Phil Gibbs in leg 10 reclaimed our position after a great\nrun by Pete Johnson in leg 9. Rob Allinson running the longest leg\nworked wonders for the team as usual, by finishing with the second\nfastest time for that leg. only 9 seconds behind the fastest from\nDortmund. Credit to Bryan for pulling up over 40 places during leg 2.\nBecause the leaders quickly\ngain hours on the trailers, the race\ncontains three restarts, the first\nbeing at Dinxperlo for leg 11. The\nrunners and their accompanying\ncyclists took to the road at 06.03,\njust ahead of panic and near\ndisaster as 150 minibuses jostled\nfor space to head off on the car\nroute to deposit the leg 12 runner\nin time. We just made it and then\nno real trouble throughout the\nsecond stage, finishing 5th at\nBarchem for legs 11-18.\nSimilar pandemonium reigned\nat the second restart at 11.00. with\na last minute switch of our\nrunners for legs 19-24 to the\nminibus which was least hemmed\nin. Again, there was no real\ntrouble up to leg 24 which ended\nat Boekelo, a small town\ncompletely engulfed by 4500 lads\nand lasses and about 300\nminibuses. The shops and cafes\nand Pubs can never have known\nsuch trade. Up to this point, the\nrestarts had been in two halves.\n' with the runners of teams 76-150\nsetting of lan hour after those from\n1-75.'\nAt Boekelo however, for the\nstart ofthe final leg, 150 of'the best\nrunners at the event lined up\ntogether at 16.15 behind a roaring\nset of motorcycles which were to\nclear the way. Motorcyclists,\nrunners then their bew idle red bicycle escorts set off in a spectacular surge, as the rest of\nthe teams rushed for their\nminibuses in an attempt to travel\nto the finish before the first\nLeg Name Sex Course College Time Position\n1.

The winners were Delft\nDelvers from Hol and in 9.31.50,\nbut Gottingen from Germany\nwere only robbed of victory\nthrough fielding one runner\ntwice, which is against the\nregulations.\nThe party afterwards was as\nsensational as the race itself and\nwas held at the Bastille, the 21st century Union building of\nTwente Polytechnic, where the\nrace finished.\nOur thanks to RC C for the loan\nof two very well behaved\nminibuses.\nRichard Harrington\nL\": TENNIS Imperial College v London House\nThe mens team were due to play the annual fixture against\nLondon House last Saturday.\nWe met in the glorious sunshine of Princes Gardens\nstunned by the thought that we might play a match\nuninterrupted by rain or sleet.\nOn arriving at Harlington, we decided to practice until our\nopponents turned up. After playing singles for an hour under\nthe burning sun, everybody agreed that it was time for a rest.\nAs we were crawling towards the bar at about three o 'clock, our\nopponents arrived in two taxis. After introducing themselves they said\nthey would like to start the match as soon as possible.\nOur first pair, Tony and Adrian, got off to a blinding start, losing 6-1,\n6-1, to Alastair and Arnaud. Tony played his usual game but Adrians\nplay became more feverish as the game progressed. After this setback\nAdrian retired with some form of plague, to be replaced by Neville.\nThis resulted in a comfortable win against Londons third pair, Graham and Clive.\nChris and Dave were IC's best pair of the day, dropping only seven\ngames to London's2 nd and 3rd pairs before tea.\nBarry and Dave halved their first match against Dave and Lalit, but\nkept the contest open by losing to Arnaud and Alastair.\nDuring tea, Tony suggested that next time we skip practice session,\nAdrian wandered about like a ghost and Chris came to the stunning\nconclusion that we were 31/2 - 21/2 up.\nThe three matches after tea were all drawn. The most worthy of these\nwas Chris and Dave scoring 3-6, 6-3 against Arnaud and Alastair who\nhad previously dropped only l our games.\nFinal Score:\nImperial College 5 London House 4,\nTeams:\nfC.-Tony Tsoukkas and Adrian Clarke (Neville Pitt) Chris Yates and Dave\nCornwell.

It is also hoped that a hardship fund will beset up\nto help those affected by the increases.\nIf you are at all concerned about the discrimination against\noverseas students in this way then sign the petition in the Union\nOffice and come to the lobby outside 170 Queens Gate at 10.30\nam on May 25th. Refectories\nI was amazed to hear that refectory committee actually voted\non the monthly constant ofthe regulator. If one quarter of a per\ncent turns out to be too small then obviously the committee can\nvote to change it. I hope that this democratic procedure will\ncontinue, and if it does then there should be little cause for\ncomplaint from the student body.\nOf course, what you gain on the roundabouts you lose on the\nbar prices. At the moment we are suffering from higher prices\ncompared with the locals. When the survey reveals this\ndiscrepancy I hope Professor Eilon will carry out his policy of\nkeeping College prices competitive.\nNEWS IN BRIEF YACHT REPAIRED\nYacht Club should soon be able\nto use their yacht following the\nsatisfactory completion of repairs\nto the engine.\nProblems started last summer\nwhen it was discovered that work\ncosting \u00a3800 was necessary.

Of these however many\nare self supporting and have said\nthat they will face financial\nhardship with the increased lees.\nThe Union is to lobby College\nGovernors next Friday in protest\nagainst overseas students being\ncharged higher fees than home\nstudents.

    "content": "Page8 The Ins and Outs of Finding Somewhere to Live\nThere are two stages in this process. The obvious one is finding a landlord who has a vacancy and there are a number of ways in which\nyou can go about doing this. The second stage is convincing the\nlandlord that you are the sort of tenant that he is looking for. In many\nways this is the most difficult part and one whose importance seems to\nbe generally underestimated. Anyway, first of all find your landlord.\nSources of addresses include:-THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON ACCOMMODATION OFFICE.\nThis is situated at 8 Princes Gardens and has contacts with a great\nmany landlords. They are also geared up to help you find a place this\nterm for next year and can send you addresses during the vac. Most\nof their accommodation consists of beds its and lodgings and they do\nnot have a high proportion of flats. Contact them towards the end of May\nfor next year.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION WELFARE CENTRE\nThis can be found on the third floor of the Union Building. It has far\nfewer landlords than the UL accommodation Office and tends to rely\nmore on advertising for new landlords than dealing with established\nones. Also there are no facilities for sending you addresses during the\nvacation. However, if you drop in at the beginning of June, there may be\nsome addresses that you can contact, to book for next year.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE RESIDENCE OFFICE\n(Room 161 Sherfield) Although all College Accommodation is\nallocated well in advance there are the occasional vacancies which arise\nthrough people moving out for one reason or another. It is worth\nremembering that the Residence Office keeps a waiting list throughout\nthe year from which these vacancies are filled.\nFLAT AGENCIES\nThese are generally rude, unhelpful and extortionate. Their main\nobject is to seperate you from your money as quickly as possible. They\nare re known ed for being on the landlord's side and advising him on\nways to avoid the Rent Acts. Many agencies don't deal with the kind of\nproperty that you will be able to afford and they charge up to two weeks\nrent for simply giving you an address which may or may not still have a vacancy and which may be completely unsuitable. They are not legally\nentitled to charge you unless you move into an address that they have\ngiven you but this doesn't stop them trying! There are a couple of\nagencies which don't charge the tenant and it is worth remembering\nthat estate agents usually charge the landlord rather than the tenant,\nthough they may ask you for a contribution towards the cost of drawing\nup the tenancy agreement. The Welfare Centre should have an updated\nlist of agencies at the beginning of next term (the present one is a bit out\nof date) and it is sometimes worth trying them if you are rich or are\nlooking for something very particular or out of the ordinary.\nNEWSPAPERS\nThe evening Standard is the best place to look but it is a poor best.\nPeople queue outside their office early in the morning to catch the first\nedition hot from the press. The phone numbers of reasonably affordable\nplaces are constantly engaged and if you do eventually get through and\nthe landlord agrees to show you round the place, you are likely to find\nthat you are being given a conducted tour along with a large group of\nother hopefuls.\nThe Evening News doesn't tend to have so many advertisements but\notherwise the same applies. Local papers like the Kensington and\nChelsea News and the Fulham Chronicle also carry advertisements and\nare not quite so heavily subscribed but they don't have so many\nadvertisements to chose from.\nIf the Times is back next autumn, its 'Flat Share' column is a very\nuseful source of places.\nADVERTISING\nThe Evening Standard is the best place to advertise and for \u00a312 or so\nyou should be able to place a reasonable sort of advert. The trouble is\nthat you need a phone number where landlords can contact you and a lot of the offers you will get will be miles away from where you want to\nlive.\nNOTICEBOARDS\nA lot of tobacconists have display boards where people advertise\nvacancies but the places are usually gone by the time you ring. It also\ninvolves a lot of foot slogging to find the noticeboards in the first place\nalthough there is a list of them in the Welfare Centre which you can\nconsult.\nSELLING YOURSELF TO A LANDLADY\nOnce you have got hold of a few numbers to ring, it is time to give a bit\nof thought to your technique in approaching the landlady. In many\ncases the landlady will operate on a first come first served basis and so\nthere won't be any problem so long as you more or less fit in with what\nthe landlady has in mind. Many landladies, however, are more selective\nand you can be sure that if she is offering a good deal at a time of heavy\ndemand, she will have a lot of people to choose from. Especially if you\nare going to be living in the same house as the landlady, she will be\nlooking for someone who sounds polite, considerate, fits her idea of the\nsort of person that she wants and appears flexible - or even exploit able in some cases. The initial phone call to the landlady and any subsequent\nmeeting are very important. So, even though you may be exhausted and\nfrustrated by the time you ring a particular landlady and even though the\nroom that she is offering sounds like a second cousin to the Black Hole\nof Calcutta, it helps a lot if you can sound enthusiastic, polite and\npliable. Don't whatever you do, mention the Rent Acts and if you are told\nthat you have no Rent Act protection don't question it (although of\ncourse, if there is time you can check what your legal position is likely to\nbe with the Welfare Centre before you sign anything). Take a long hard\nlook at your bargaining position before you even quibble about the rent.\nWait until you are established in the place and entitled to any remedies\nas regards security of tenure or registering a lower rent via the Rent\nOfficer or Rent Tribunal and then do something about it.\nAlthough at the beginning of term the most important thing is to get a roof over your head, it is advisable to be a little cautious about what you\naccept. If you can move into a place where there is no problem about\nmoving out at short notice then it isn't so bad because you can look for\nsomewhere better as soon as the rush has died down. But beware of\nsigning an agreement for a long fixed period on an unsatisfactory place\nbecause if you do it will be very difficult to avoid staying there for the\nduration of the agreed period.\nVarious Types ol\nThere are a number of different\nkinds of accommodation which\nyou might end up in next year.\nAlthough places are advertised\nunder one label or another, there\nis a great deal of variety within\ndifferent types and many are a hybrid of two or more types.\nTo start off with, unless you can\nfix something up well in advance,\nyou are unlikely to have much\nchoice as to where you live but\nonce the rush has died down it\nshould be possible for you to find\nthe kind of place that you are\nlooking for. Here is a summary of\nwhat you can expect if you are\noffered a particular type of\naccommodation.\nLODGINGS OR 'DIGS'.\nThis sort of place is where you\nbecome part of the landlady's family and where she cooks for\nyou, mends your socks and acts\ngenerally as a sort of surrogate\nmother. This category is on the\ndecline and is not very popular\nwith most people as it can tie you\nto meal times and so on and tends\nto be fairly expensive. Nevertheless it can be a very comfortable\nexistence, providing a proper\nhome base and guaranteed\ncompany.\nBEDSITS\nThis is the most common type\nof accommodation and often the\nworst. Bedsits vary from proper\nbed sitting rooms with tables,\nchairs and all the requisites for a civilised existence to partitioned\nspaces, hardly big enough for a single bed. One landlord put a bed\ninto a tiny room which he was\nusing as a book cupboard and\noffered it as a beds it for \u00a317 per\nweek. Another put a bed into a loft\nspace which was so low that you\nwould have to crawl to get to the\nbed and offered it for \u00a315 per week.\nOn the whole, beds its are small\nrooms, furnished to a minimal\nstandard with an electric ring for\ncooking and use of a communal\nbathroom and toilet.\nThe arrangements vary also,\nfrom something just a little short\nof digs where you live in the\nlandlady's house and she gives\nyou breakfast and doesn't impose\ntoo many restrictions to places\nwhere the only thing about you\nwhich isn't resented and complained about is your money.\nThen there are the real beds it jungle type rooms which consist\nof run down houses crudely\nknocked into beds its where you\ndon't even have an unfriendly\nlandlady for company. Most of the\npeople who operate this kind of\nletting are in it purely and simply\nfor the money. If a room can\nconceivably hold two beds, two\nbeds will go in and it will be let to\ntwo people for twice the price.\nRepairs are often never done and\nthat new carpet which the\nlandlord promised you when you\nmoved in rarely materialise s. On the other hand, there are\ngood beds its to be had and there\nare good landladies but they are\nthe exception. If at the beginning\nof term you find yourself in one\nwhich isn't up to standard, don't give up. Keep pestering the\npeople whose job it is to help you\nwith accommodation until you\nfind somewhere that is.\nPage9 A Place to Live and the Law\nOnce you have found somewhere to live, you may wonder\nwhat your chances are of staying there if your landlord takes a sudden dislike to you. Can he just put your belongings out into\nthe street and change the locks, or is there more to it than that?\nParliament, through a series of Rent and other Acts, has evolved a system of protection which varies in strength with the kind of\naccommodation that you occupy, but unfortunately it is often difficult\nto decide which particular category you fall into.\nThe two main categories of accommodation for this purpose are\nlicences which can be terminated with very little notice after which you\nhave no protection at all, and tenancies where there are varying d egress of protection.\nLicences include rooms in hotels and hostels, genuine bed and\nbreakfast arrangements and places where the landlord or his agents\nhave free access, without reference to you, to all parts of the\naccommodation that you occupy. If you are given an agreement which\ncalls itself a licence, this does not necessarily make you a licence e but if\nthe arrangement of the accommodation is such that you don't have a room to yourself, and the agreement contains a clause to the effect that\nthe landlord has the right to move one of you out and move in a replacement and if each share r signs a separate agreement, then it is\nquite possible that this would make you a licence e. Rooms in a hall of\nresidence are also usually licences. When a licence is terminated, you\nbecome, in effect, a squatter. This means that although the landlord\ncannot use force to evict you, there is nothing to stop him changing the\nlocks while you are out.\nAll other types of accommodation count as tenancies which means\nthat your landlord can't get rid of you without a possession order from\nAccommodation\nHOTELS\nNot, alas, the Hilton but beds its by another name. There are a lot of these in Bayswater and\nparts of West London. The main\nsnag is that they tend to throw you\nout at the beginning of the\nSummer Term so that they can get\non with their real business of\ncapital ising on the hoards of\ntourists.\nFLATS\nIn many ways flats are the ideal\nsolution in that they can be turned\ninto something approaching a home and you can live with\nfriends. On the other hand they\nare usually expensive and notoriously difficult to find. Also,\nthe strain of living on top of each\nother in a small flat can lead to\npersonality clashes and people\ndropping out, leaving the others\nto find their share of the rent. The\nmoral of this is that it is advisable\nto make sure that you and your\nfellow share rs are sufficiently\ncompatible to put up with each\nother in what can sometimes be\nvery trying circumstances.\nWhen you are trying to get\npeople together for a flat it is\nworth bearing in mind that most\nflats are for three or four people\nand flats for larger numbers are\nvery rare indeed. Also, some\nlandlords are not keen to let to\nmixed groups because they feel,\nrightly or wrongly, that mixed\ngroups are more likely to split up\nand run into difficulties with\npaying the rent.\nFlats, like beds its, vary\nconsiderably in quality. An average flat might have two\n'double' bedrooms - i.e. bedrooms\nthat can just hold two beds, a lounge (if you're lucky) and a kitchen and bathroom. Single\nrooms in flits are rare or very\nsmall.\nUNFURNISHED FLATS\nThese tend to be a lot cheaper\nbut are almost unobtainable. If\nyou approach one of the few\nagencies that deal with unfurnished flats, they will\nprobably only be able to help you\nif you can afford to pay hundreds\nof pounds for 'fixtures' and\n' fittings'. Other sources of\nunfurnished flats are Housing\nAssociations and Local Authorities who sometimes allow students to live in flats which are\nunsuitable for families (usually\nbecause you have to climb up a lot of stairs to get to them) or are\n'short life' properties which means\nthat they are due for demolition.\nThe Union is at present trying to\nestablish contact with bodies who\ncan offer this kind of accommodation but since many of them say\nthat they can only help people\nwho are already living in their\nareas, you might well be able to\nget something by approaching\nthe Housing Department in the\nTown Hall of the area which you\nare living at present and any\nHousing Association operating in\nthe area.\nSquatting is another way of\nfinding very cheap ac com moda tion, but it does tend to have a lot\nof problems associated with it. If\nyou are interested in squatting,\nthe best thing to do is to contact\nthe Squatters Union, Telephone\n70I569I. the courts. In addition you are entitled to adequate notice, of the\nlandlord's intention to rescind his arrangement with you. so, except in\nthe case of a tenancy for a fixed period, the landlord must give 28 days\nnotice in writing before he can even start applying for a possession\norder. Any other attempt by the landlord to exclude or h arras s you\nconstitutes a criminal offence for which he can be prosecuted by the\nlocal council.\nSo, what are the chances of the court granting a possession order to a landlord who has given you a valid notice to quit?\nThere are a number of cases where the court will almost certainly\ngive an order. These include tenancies of places which used to be the\nlandlord's residence and he wants to live there again or wants it for\nmembers of his family who used to live there or if he bought the house as\na retirement home and now wants to retire there. In both cases the\nlandlord is meant to notify you of'any such intention at the beginning of\nthe tenancy, in writing, but the court can dispense with this\nrequirement. Other cases are where you signed an agreement to stay for\na period of less than eight months in an out of season holiday letting or if\nthe letting is for the purpose of a holiday (though you might sometimes\nbe able to argue that it was clearly not let for any such purpose). The same applies to student letting s where the landlord is the college or\nuniversity; places with a very high rate able value or extremely low rent\nand council and housing association owned property. Another example\nof this is where the landlord offers you suitable alternative\naccommodation.\nIf you are a tenant and your landlord lives in the same building (so\nlong as the place is not a purpose built block of flats) the court will grant\na possession order unless you apply to the rent tribunal before the expiry\nof the notice period. To find out how to do this contact the welfare\ncentre or the housing department at your town hall. The Rent Tribunal can grant you an extension of up to six months. At the end of that period\nyou can reapply but once the tribunal protection is exhausted a possession order will be granted.\nIn most other cases than those outlined above you would have\nsecurity of tenure for as long as you wanted to stay there so long as you\nfulfill your obligations. Owing to the complexity of this subject, the\nabove can only be a rough guide and if you are threatened with eviction\nyou should seek advice at the Welfare Centre with reference to your\nparticular circumstances. Michael Arthur Welfare Adviser\nTHE COST OF A PLACE Some of you may remember\nfilling in an accommodation\nsurvey at the beginning of last\nterm. The results of the survey\nhave produced quite a lot of useful\ninformation on what people have\nbeen paying for accommodation\nthis year and the standards of the\nplaces that they have been living\nin. In terms of what you can\nexpect to pay next year, rents will\nprobably be at least 10% higher\nthan they have been this year.\nSTANDARDS Out of about 250 replies we\nfound that living conditions were\noften not satisfactory. We asked\n\u2022 three specific questions about\nliving standards and the\npercentage of people who thought\nthat their accommodation was\ndefective in one or more respects\nwas as follows:\nNowhere adequate to work\nToo noisy to work\nInadequate heating\nOne or more of the above\nThese results don't take any\naccount of all the other defects\nthat a place might have.\nThe results showed that although some people had found\ncheap accommodation (e.g.6% of\npeople living in flats were paying\nrent of less than \u00a38 each per\nweek), most people were having\nto pay through their noses.\n40% of the respondents were\npaying over \u00a315 per week for rent\nalone and when you include\n'extras' e.g. heating and lighting\ncosts. 44% of those in beds its and\n54% of those living in flats were\npaying over \u00a315 each per week.\nHardly anybody was paying\nless than \u00a31 or over \u00a3\\9 per week\nand most were paying between^ and \u00a316 per week for just the rent.\nFlats seem to be more expensive\nthan beds its mainly because\nheating costs etc are much higher.\nSo, when you start looking at\nplaces to live for next year. I hope\nBEDS ITS \u202221.1%\n10.0%\n23.3%\n37.7%\nFLATS18.7%18.7%35.0%51.2% this will give you some idea as to\nwhat to expect and whether or not\nthe landlord is charging over the\nodds.\n\n"
