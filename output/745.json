    "content": "Letters FELIX, Friday August 1st19862 What a Waste!\nDear Sir,\nThe opening of the Queens Tower to the general\npublic and the consequent time and expense the project\nhas taken up, with financial viability clearly impossible,\nwould provide an excellent story for the recent comedy\nseries 'A Very Peculiar Practice'. Has the College really\ngot \u00a328,000 available to throw at a project with no hope\nof a financial return? Perhaps the odd academic\ndepartment could find a use for such a sum? Even IC\nUnion might be able to use the money more wisely; a new glider, rowing eight; the list is endless.\nI note that the opening of the Tower is supposed to be\nof public relations value. I vaguely recall 'IC Day'\norganised by the much missed Captain Lindley, being\nfor such a purpose. Surely College has not saddled itself\nwith another administrator who needs a job to keep him\nout of the way?\nYours sincerely\nNick Shackley\nDouble\nStandards\nDear Sir,\nHaving been fortunate enough to have been a student\nat Imperial College for the past three years, but having\nnever before been resident in London during the\nsummer vacation, it has only just come to my attention\nthat the College undergoes a quite astonishing\ntransformation during that period.\nFar from closing down as I, in my ignorance, had\nalways imagined, it has become a veritable hive of\nactivity: the departments are filled with summer\nstudents, eagerly attending well structured and taught\ncourses, whilst Estates, in a commendable effort to\nmake them feel even more welcome, have carried out\nextensive refurbishment and signposting in and around\nthe Southside residences, with an efficiency and\nthrough ness that belies their reputation.\nWhilst personally Ifindsuch activity entirely laudable\nand indication of the benevolent and praiseworthy\nattitude of the College Authorities, some of my more\ncynical friends take a somewhat different view. It is, they\ntell, me, rather ironic that College should make so much\neffort over the summer, only to lapse into what they\ndescribe as its usual uncaring stance when the 'real'\nstudents return in October, and they even go so far as to\nsuggest that the College's motive are not entirely\nunconnected with those of financial gain.\nOf course, such views are, as all right thinking people will realise, entirely the product of sour grapes and\nCommunist infiltration, are entirely without\nfoundation, and thus I look forward keenly to seeing\nthem proved wrong this October.\nYours\nIan Thomas.\nA Phoney\nLetter\nDear Sir,\nIt has come to my attention that a crazed lunatic\nposing as David Jones, FELIX Editor has been\nharassing members of the public into writing letters for a certain 'magazine'. I feel that the public should be\nwarned about such a person, and insist that the College\nSecurity Officer check this man's typewriter\nimmediately.\nYours\nChris Edwards\nBoycotts:\nA New View\nDear Sir,\nOnce again the season for international competition is\nupon us and I expect most of your readers (being true\npatriots) have been glued to their televisions sets eagerly\nlapping up the triumph (and disasters) of their respective\nnational teams.\nHowever, I feel that the time has come to point out\nthat whilst a little friendly rivalry is no bad thing, such\nblatant setting of nation against nation can only serve to\nbolster the average citizen's latent jingoistic instincts\nleading inevitably to an increased level of nationalism\nand possible insularity in the competing nations.\nObviously were such attitudes to become prevalent in\nthe world they could only serve to heighten the political\ntensions between countries and idea logie s and so lead us\never nearer to the nuclear precipice.\nThus I ask all true patriots, if they truely love their\ncountries and wish to keep them from the Holocaust to\njoin the various countries boycotting the\nCommonwealth Games in order that world peace may\nbe maintained.\nYours ever so sincerely\nHugh Stiles\nChem Eng PG\nA Totally\nSpurious Space\nFilling Letter\nDear Dave,\nCongratulations on your appointment, blah blah blah\netc. I hope you manage to fill this page etc.\nWhat I really meant to say is that I hope you'll make\nsure we get some better music in the FELIX office this\nyear and not just endless crucial jazz-funk-bongo-reggae\nfusion like your predecessor.\nYours\nMark Cottle\n(Ageing Hippy)\nBad Times\nDear Sir,\nAs an Imperial College Union member of many years,\none of my greatest pleasures in these harrowed times has\nbeen the peace of the Union Office. Many happy hours\nhave been passed reading the papers, drinking the free\ncoffee and borrowing cigarettes off the rich officers.\nYet, when I returned after my annual leave in\nBlackpool-what do I find? Firstly, the new sabbaticals\nhave given up smoking, no butt end in sight. Secondly,\nthe coffee equipment has been removed to the hovel the\nHon Sec dares to claim 'Office', and thirdly, and this is\nsurely the closest this once great institution has come to\nthe ravening hordes of international communism the\n'Times' has been banned from the environs for being\n'politically unsound'. I must protest, through your\ncolumn against these heretical ideas I would ask all\nupstanding decent members of this Union to visit the\nUnion Office as soon as possible in order to see for\nthemselves the ter r rib le conditions imposed there by the\nnew junta.\nYours\nDave Parry\nQueen's Tower\nCollege administration claims that\nthe Queen's Tower scheme was not\nexpected to show a working profit, or\neven to cover its costs, during the first\nsummer of operation. That the Tower\nwould not do weU from the outset\nmight indeed have been predicted, but\nI cannot believe that the College is not\ndisappointed in the response. The\nproject may in time be profitable both\nfinancially and in public relations\nterms, but it is remarkable that\nsomething so initially costly should be\nundertaken when funding has been\nreduced to a minimum in other areas.\nIt seems that the Union may have a struggle on its hands to win a College\nloan for the new glider. I would\nsuggest to Gliding Club that it makes\nit known that it intends to name its\nnew toy after some Colege dignitary.\nI shall be announcing the name of the\nnew FELIX offset ii tho in the next\nissue.\nNUS Affiliation\nMr Vaughen West, the London\nregional secretary of the NUS has\nexpressed his intention to \"get ICU\ninto the NUS\" by the end of the\ncoming a cede mic year. No doubt\nmany students at IC will dismiss the\npossibility of ICU re a ff i Uia ting, convinced that the staunchly anti-NUS altitude stil i prevails at\nImperial. I would dispute that they\nare entirely correct; in the last few\nyears the pro-NUS lobby has gained\nconsiderable support. If for no other\nreason, the need consider closely the\nrole of IC Union in student 'polities',\nmakes the discussion of affiliation to\nthe NUS beneficial.\nCredits\nFor most FELIX people this issue\nwas probably more trouble than it\nwas worth.

    "content": "Reviews FELIX, Friday August 1st19867 A Colder Climate is set in\nLondon's East End; a place\nwhere illegal dog and cock\nfights, boxing, racism,\nunwanted pregnancies and\nstand up comics blend to form\ntodays community. The\nunderlying stability/instability\nof the characters involved\nrevolves around a pub-running\nfamily and the problems it\nfaces in a society where only\nthe tough survive.\nThere are places where A Colder Climate deals well with\nspecific issues, particularly\nracism. But the majority of the\nperformances lack feeling and\n'conviction in themselves or in\ntheir relations to each other.\nThis seems to be a function of\na script that generally ill-defines characters, using\nthem, at times, solely as a vehicle for social comment.\nRon Pember, the ageing father\nof the landlady, and David\nBeames, alternating between\nsp iv, policeman and boxing\ncoach, are notable exceptions.\nA Colder Climate aims for\nreality but fails to achieve this.\nIn attempting to deal with too\nmany of the world's problems,\nit glosses over them.\nSimon Lewis 'BLACK CHILDREN BURN...'-The Royal Court until August 17th. Aliens in Camden?\nAliens, the sequel to the\n1979 film Alien, could well\nhave been called Terminator 2\nwere it not for the fact that the\nprotagonist was biological this\ntime and not Arnold\nSchwarzenegger. Aliens, like\nTerminator is written/directed\nby James Cameron, and many\nof the cast of Terminator also\nappear in Aliens with the\nnotable exception of\nSigourney Weaver. It is not\nsurprising that Aliens shares\nmany similarities with the\nearlier film: an un kill able enemy, lots of shine y weaponry and the eventual\ndefeat of the bad guys on their\nhome ground.\nWarrent Officer Ripley\n(Weaver) is picked up 57 years\nafter the destruction of the\nspaceship Nostromo and the\noriginal Alien. At first her story\nis disbelieved because of the\ncost of the spaceship she\ndestroyed, but when contact is\nlost with a crew sent to the\nAliens planet she is forced to\nreturn in an advisory capacity\nwith a troup of marines on a rescue mission. On the planet\nthey are ambushed and\nwholesale slaughter follows.\nConveniently, they damage a nuclear reactor in such,a way\nas to give themselves a time limit to get off the planet.\nThe rest of the film involves a fight to keep the aliens at bay\nwhile coaxing the orbiting\nmother ship to send down a rescue pod.\nThe film concentrates quite\nheavily on weaponry (a hobby\nof Cameron's) coming up with\nsome futuristic but\nnevertheless believe able military hardware, and\nbecause of this Aliens an\naction movie as opposed to\nthe cat and mouse thriller of\nthe original. Other\nconcessions to the 'profit\nprincipal' are a romantic\ninterest for Officer Ripley in\nthe form of Corporal Hicks\n(Michael Biehn who played\nthe male hero in Terminatorl)\nand a cute, but tough\nkid/mascot in the form of nine\nyear old Carrie Henn. Aliens is\na film well worth going to see\nif only for the Clash of the\nTitans style ending.\nCharles Rainey\n\n"

    "content": "Sabbaticals. FELIX, Friday August 1st19866 What Does A Sabbatical\nOfficer Do Over Summer?\nHello and welcome to the first of the\nmany 'Presidents's bits' you H be\ngetting from me. Keep reading for\nscintillating prose, sparkling wit, the\ntruth and nothing but...well maybe\nnot; but then this is FELIX after all.\nSince July 1st, when Jackie,\nDave, Dave and I took over, the\nquestion I 've been asked time and\ntime again (apart from 'which way to\nthe ladies toilets/Summer\nAccommodation Centre/bar?) is:\nWhat does a sabbatical do in the\nsummer? A very good question it i \u00bb\ntoo. A month ago I would have said\n'not too much' but now I know\nbetter. Quite apart from cleaning\nand tidy i r>g up the office and\nscrubbing the official President's room from top to bottom, there's been ple fit y of work to do, although\nmost of it has been in bits and\npieces. However, 1\n1\n1 try and outline\na few of the major things I 've been\ninvolved with this month.\nTraining\nIn at the deep end from the start,\na sabbatical learns the hard way, it\nseems. However there was a training weekend at Wye College,\nKent, organised by the University of\nLondon Union. It involves lots of\ntalks and workshops on subjects\nsuch as financial planning, coping\nwith college committees, planning\ncampaigns, organising Freshers'\nweek and so on. The value of the\ntraining sessions was limited due to\nthe diversity of the colleges\ninvolved, but we got some good\nideas and made lots of contacts at\nother colleges\u2014stand by for some\ngood 'joint events'. By the way, Wye\nCollege has a wonderful outdoor\nswimming pool\u2014Jackie and I now\nknow all about being in at the deep\nend at 2.30am. The Bar\nThe refurbishment of the Union\nSnack Bar, 'Norman's' is at last\nunderway. Expect to see a complete change: the new, stylish\nand comfortable lounge/snack bar\nopens in October. By then the\ntransfer of the bar licence from\nCollege to Jen (our adminstrator)\nand Bob Schroter (the Bar's senior\ntreasurer) should be complete. Due\nto the incompetence of certain ex-sabbaticals we missed the deadline\nfor the August sitting of the licensing\ncourts\u2014so now we're going for the\nSeptember session. Soon well be\nable to call it the student's Union\nBar in all honesty! Maybe well see\nyou in there....\nThe FELIX move\nIf you've been through Beit Quad\nrecently you ll have noticed that it's full of bits of wood, old sinks,\nbroken furniture and the like. Yes,\nthe great FELLX move has started\nand brings new excitement every\nday. Will the new office be ready on\ntime? Will it live up to our\nexpectations? Will Dave Jones ever\nsmile again?\nOn a more serious note why was\nMy life consists of en using that all\nthe things the students need from\nday to day are in good nick. This\nranges fr or m the minibusses to\ninsurance, and while in the topic of\ninsurance could all the people on\nthe list at the bottom of my spiel\nplease come to the Union office with\nID to collect checks.\nDuring the Summer the life for\nthe average Hon Sec is really quite\ndreary, as it is now the Dodgy Deals\nDone Dirty brigade appear. These\nboys and girls appear out of the\ncommercial woodwork as soon as\nfresh blood is smelt, and attempt\nthe old Entertainments Committee\nroom (where the print room will be\nin October) allowed to degenerate\ninto a filthy, infested mess? It really\nwas in an a palling state, which made\nit difficult for Dan Phillips (who will\nchair the Ents committee next year)\nand I to justify the need for a new\nEnts Office. Nonetheless there will\nbe a new office on the first floor; I trust Dan will take good care of it.\nAs for FELIX the move was not\nthe Union's idea but we are stuck\nwith it; now we must ensure that\nprinting is not inter r rupe d \u2014FELIX\nmust and will appear as usual at the\nstart of October. As time and space\ndon't allow me to go on about\neverything that's happening, why\nnot call into the office if there is\nanything specific you want to know\nabout? Don't expect to see me\nthere until August 5th though...\nthat's something else sabbaticals do\nduring the summer; go on holiday\nearly, to avoid the rush.\nChristine\n(inevitably succeeding) to convince\nthe poor hapless bugger sitting\nbehind the official desk to buy two\nthousand nose fitters because of the\npollution in London.\nAlso the summer is the time for\ntraining the new sabbaticals. The\ntraining takes the form of lecturing\nand small work parties that\ndisappear into little rooms, discuss\nthings, then make a presentation to\neverybody.\nThe first thing that hit me is how\npolitically orientated every o dy in\nStudent Unions are, with the LSE\nsabbaticals as a general rule being\nelected in a 'party line' type\narran g ment. That was quite an eye\nopener.\nAt the moment insurance is the\nbiggest headache with me trying to\nassess the claims still outstanding,\nand people who've waited too long\nfor settlements. But I am starting to\nsee light at the end of the tunnel.\nOne more small distraction has\nbeen the presence of lots of theatre\ncompanies in the Union Building\nrehearsing for the Edinburgh\nFringe. My consciousness has been\nwidened by the pre sc en ce of an\nacting company next to the office\nacting out a play which involves a black stallion, a donkey and a young\nmaiden. I think its a sequel to A Midsummernights Dream.\nWell bye-bye for now, and I hope\nto write again. Any comments\nplease feel free to express them.\nCheers.\nDave Colley\nPeter Wallace Mech Eng 3\nOwais Mogal Biotech 1\nDavid Martin Geology 2\nS LYap Computing Sci (MSC)\nEna Jawa Chem Eng 1\nSERVICING & REPAIRS\nat\nRICKY'S GARAGE\n(Personal service guaranteed)\n19 QUEENS GATE PLACE\nMEWS\nSOUTH KENSINGTON\nLONDON S.W.7 Tel: 01 589 1589\n\n"

    "content": "\"Shit!, you make me feel like\nArlo Guthrie at Woodstock!\" The\nwords of one Mr Loudon\nWainright III performing on the\nmain stage at this year's Glastonbury Festival held on the\nweekend of 21/22 June. It is\ntempting indeed to make\ncomparisons between the hordes\npushing speed and the odd ugly\ncharacter selling blotting paper\nas acid. There was little to stop it\nall and few to care about that.\nHowever it was also apparent \u2022\nthat heroin would have been\nextremely unwelcome; rumours\ncirculated of an unfortunate fate\nawaiting smack dealers.\nA HIPPY FESTIVAL ?\nof festival goers who flocked to\nWorthy Farm in the idyllic\nWiltshire countryside and a previous generation who first\nattracted the title 'hippies', that\nthe press like to attach to both\ngroups. But a closer look will\nre ve a! that it is very difficult to\nclassify the modern festival\naudience. In fact even the\ndescription 'audience' isn't totally\naccurate. It is the mass of\npunters who really make an\nevent like Glastonbury what it is.\nNot so the big one day affairs\nlike Donnington which tend to\nbe merely outdoor heavy metal\nconcerts.\nThe famous pyramid is only\nthe centre of a huge sprawling\ntent city within which is a whole\nmicrocosm of society.\nOrganisation is not obvious and\nthat is why a lot of people go.\nBut at the same time a lot of\npreparation must have gone into\nthe site in which this anarchic\nassembly occurs with such\napparent smoothness. A thousand and one vans and\nstalls dispensed fast food to suit\nvirtually any conceivable diet. Ail\nnight long stoned DJs on the\npirate Radio Avalon' played\nfloating space music for the\nearthbound star children. At\nevery turn there was someone\nhawking hand made\nmerchandise of all descriptions.\nThis was, despite appearances, a capitalist dream world; not just a festival of entertainment but also\nan alternative economy.\nThere were, of course, the\ninevitable drug dealers. Signs\ndeclared that anyone advertising\ndrugs would be ejected from the\nsite, so instead they shouted\ntheir spiel as they wandered\nabout. Mainly it was mara juana on sale along with a fair number\nof bikers and Rastafarians\nAs for a general description of\nfestival goers, the best that can\nbe said is that they were ail\ncasually dressed. From Volvo\ndriving families camped near the\nmain approach road to convoy\npeople in the 'Green' field, via\nstudents, punks, Rastas, bikers\nand Level 42 fans there seemed\nto be most sorts. My own two\noverwhelming impressions were\nof the sheer geographical size of\nthe place and of the lack of\ntrouble. Tents sprawled over hills\nso that nowhere could you stand\nand see the whole site (the\nexception being in the helicopter\nflying somewhat expensive\nsightseeing trips). Estimates put\nthe attendance at between\n85,000 and 100,000 which shou d at first sight be good news for\nCND who, despite the lack of a strong anti-nuclear stance at the\nfestival, receive more money\nfrom it than any other source.\nHowever the crowd was far\nabove official limits, swelled by\nvast numbers who simply walked\nin without tickets across\nsurrounding fields where there\nwas nothing to stop them.\nPerhaps the spirit of the free\nfestival lives on.\nBut at Glastonbury it may\nhave to take a break. Farmer and\norganiser Michael Eavis says his\nfamily and the surrounding\nresidents need a rest from the\nannual invasion. There may have\nto be a complete re-think of the\nevent in view of its soaring\ngrowth since the free festival\nbeginnings in 1971. Far from this\nbeing a 'band aid' style charity\nthe fees charged by headline\nbands are threatening the\nfinancial viability.\nThere is also the question of\nfree festivals, which Glastonbury\nis undeniably not. It is\nGlastonbury more than anything\nThis year's Glastonbury CND festival was the\nlargest ever. Since the original free festival in\n1971 there has been some considerable\nchange. Is it a legal version of Stonehenge or a else which diverted people from\nthe fiasco around Stonehenge.\nSo the question must arise as to\nwhat will happen next year.\nWhat will fill the obvious\ndemand for a mass escape for\ntens of thousands of people\nfrom the humdrum of normal\nlife? What with Dr. and The\nMedics reaching number one\nand Suzanne Vega storming the\nCD and album charts it seems to\nbe getting trendy to be a touch\nhippy-like. There is a possibility\nof a movement for a national\nfree festival, so who knows? By\nnext June even The Face may\nbe telling its readers to head for\ntheir nearest ancient site with\nKaftan and 've ge' burger in\nhand!\nThe Entertainment\nGlastonbury Festival centres on\nan ingenious pyramid shaped\nbarn which doubles once a year\nas a superb main stage which\nthis year saw an impressive bill\nof big name acts. However even\nmore impressive in some\nrespects was the vast array of\nassorted acts and events at a total of eight other venues. In\nthe cinema marquee nightly bills\nof decide l yun alternative films\nwere interrupted only by\ntelevised coverage of the equally\nun alternative England v Argentina match.\nPerhaps a more festive\natmosphere was to be found up\nat the acoustic stage where any\nnumber of acts not requiring ten\nmillion watts of amplification\nappeared. The simple marquee\nand stage were certainly not an\nindication of a lack of talent.\nNeither love nor money could\nhave got you near the place on\nSaturday for Billy Bragg and\nLoudon Wainright III. While on\nSunday one of the surprises of\nthe weekend as far as I was\nconcerned was Maria Muldaur\nwho proved she is an extremely\ntalented blues singer indeed.\nThe vast emotional and volume\nrange of her voice was backed\nup by some faultless playing\nfrom a guitarist who managed to\nsound just a bit reminiscent of BB King. For some odd reason\nMaria Muldaur was switched to\nthe smaller stage at short notice\nbut she could easily have\nupstaged some of the\nre-enactment of Woodstock for the Yuppie\ngeneration. FELIX official aging hippy Mark\nCottle went along camera in hand to find out\nand even paid to get in!\nsupposedly big name pop\ngroups in the main field.\nAs the main schedule wound\nup after dark the 'Big Orange\nCabaret' took to the boards in\nthe acoustic marquee. This was\nvery much the lunatic fringe,\npresenting more alternative\ncabaret than you could hope to\nfind in Covent Garden in\nmonths. From feminist blues\nguitarists to ranting folk freaks\nthey were all presented with\nsuave style. My favourites were\nThe Brighton Bottle Orchestra a pair of dinner suited loonies who\ncan be found appearing on the\nEdinburgh Fringe in the not too\ndistant future.\nBack on the main stages all\nthree days oozed national talent\nelbowing for a space between\nmidday and midnight. Clashes\nbetween acts on different stages\nmeant a decidedly subjective\nview of the bill. Generously\npeople like Messrs Bragg and\nLoudon Wainright performed on\nthree separate occasions.\nHeadlining on Friday night were\nthe Psychadelic Furs who\nmanaged to be somewhat less\nthan psych a deli c despite a lavish\nlight show in the pyramid. An\nexception was their final encore\n'India', which was perhaps the\nbest of their first album and an\nacknowledgement of the\nsuperiority of that material.\nEarlier in the day had seen the\nPogues performing with\nabandon.\nSaturday was, I thought the\nhigh point of the three days.\nApproximately two thirty and the\nbeginning of a lazy hazy\nafternoon lying on the grass\nfound Latin Quarter fitting the\natmosphere perfectly. Most\npeople I know either love or hate\ntheir brand of semi ethnic pop\nwith a political edge. But at that\ntime of day they were the perfect\nGlastonbury Festival band and\ntheir pleas to make the anti\napart hied tee shirt the symbol of\nthis summer seem well timed.\n'Radio Africa' is undeniably their\nbest number but the other\nmaterial grows on you if you\nlisten.\nFollowing on from the\ndecide ly smooth Latin Quarter\nwas the brash country\noutrageous ness of Loudon\nWainright III singing about dead\nskunks, dead marriages and dog\nshit with an honesty that grabs\nthe gut. Loudon is the height of\ngood taste in baggy shorts,\nshades and baseball hat as he\nlays into every topic sacred to\nconservative musical\nestablishment. Actually Loudon\nWainright is an engaging\ncharacter who could almost\nmake you like Americans with\nno taste in clothes at all and I eagerly await his wider exposure\nin this country. Following\nLoudon was John Martyn\ndisplaying dazzling brilliance on\nboth acoustic and electric guitar.\nPerhaps I'm a bit of a cynic but\nhis more jazzy material lost me.\nInstead I went to stage 2 to\nsee darlings of the independent\nrecord charts Half Man Half\nBiscuit who did a competent\nimpersonation of Half Man Half\nBiscuit last time I saw them. If\nthey are to have a long term\nfuture they need a new direction\nand an extension of their stage\nbanter beyond 'Ta!'. Other\ndarlings of the independent\nscene Fuzzbox were hot on the\nheels of Half Man Half Crumbs.\nA lot has been said of the hype\nvalue of four teenage schoolgirls\nwho can't play but that doesn't seem awfully important. Anyone,\nlike me, old enough to\nremember punk rock might\nremember a group called the\nSlits who managed to rip off a lot of Fuzzbox's sound before\nthey even thought of it. Perhpas\nI'm a little too cynical, there's certainly no denying the\nenthusiasm the Fuzzboxed put\ninto their act and in the end its\nentertainment value that counts.\nUse your own taste to judge.\nSaturday headliners The Cure\n\u2022showed they are fully\nestablished as a 'Big Name' band\nboth by the spectacular nature\nof their show and the fee they\nextorted. Higher powers\nconveniently conjured up a thunderstorm to counter pti in t the eye boggling laze rs with\nmercifully little actual rain. As\nwe sat on a hill watching the\nlighting circle a far valley my\nstoned companion commented\n'Hey God's sent us a light show', and so it seemed.\nSunday was something of a wind down. Early on Irishman\nChristy Moore got a reception\nbetter than many a bigger name.\nThe song I remember most by\nhim was a poignant ballad by of\nall people the late Bobby Sands.\nAn odd phenomenon but this\nwas what the crowd loved.\nMadness did their stuff in a surprisingly cong rous manner,\nfiling in with the odd match\nreport from Mexico. They were\nfollowed by Level 42 who\nmanaged to look not the least\nout of place, slick as ever.\nFinal act Gil Scott Heron may\nbe an outstanding and\noutspoken musician but he\nsomehow failed to stun. Too\nmuch polish for a radical show\nperhaps. I still preferred the first\nacts on Stage 2. Gerry and Terry\nbrought infectious rock and roll\nenthusiasm while the\nomnipresent Loudon Wainright\ngave something of a repeat\nperformance. A tribute to smaller\nnames maybe? If all that\nwasn't enough you could put\nmoney on Lineker scoring first\nagainst Argentina, be\nphotographed with a python,\nsit in a tent and listen to a stoned pirate DJ or go and learn\nabout alternative medicine. Then\nyou could take most of Monday\ngetting away from the site\nLoudon Wainright models\nbeach bum chic! An alternative bookie? Surely some things never change.\n\n"

This is in\naddition to an initial capital outlay\nof \u00a315,000 which was spent on safety\nwork, before visitors were allowed\ninto the Tower.\nMr Arthur told FELIX that the\nTower could not be expected to\nshow a profit in the early stages, as it\nwould take time for interest to build\nup. He also stressed that it had been\nimportant to adapt a low key\napproach to public ising the Tower\nbefore the organisation of guided\ngroups had been properly tried and\ntested. He said that he now had a system which worked very well, and\nthat the guides had coped easily with\na group of 50 people who had visited\nthe Tower recently.\nUp to the middle of this week,\napproximately 1500 people had\nvisited the tower, with the highest\nfigure on any day being 128. The\nlowest attendance to date is 23. At\nthe current staffing level the Tower\nneeds approximately 170 per day, at\na charge of 60 pence, to cover\nrun n ning costs.\nMr Arthur, who has taken the\ninitiative in getting the project off\nthe ground, expects that the Queen's Tower will eventually become as\npopular as the Monument, which\nhas 500 visit ers per day. In the light\nof this, and the fact that the Tower\nhad 440 visitors in under 3 hours on\nthe day of Rag Fete, he is expecting\nthere to be between 500 and 1000\nvisitors per day. He agreed,\nhowever, the scheme is unlikely to\nattract enough visit o ers daily to\nbalance running costs before the end\nof the summer.\nMr Arthur explained that it had\nbeen impossible to contemplate a mass publicity campaign to launch\nthe opening, since the day of the\ncompletion of alterations had been\nuncertain. In addition the scheme\nhad to be approved by the insurers s. Since the Tower opened, a press\nrelease has been distributed widely\nthroughout London, and leafletting\nhas been used in Exhibition Road\nand in Knightsbridge. The Tower\nwas featured on Thames News on\nJuly 16th, and was also featured on\nLBC and in the Times Higher\nEducation Supplement.\nMr Arthur feels that he now has a better feel of what sort of publicity is\nrequired. He has written to Hotels\nand to all ground handlers who deal\nwith tourist trips in London. He\nhopes that the Queen's Tower will\nshortly be included in various\nLondon tourist guides. He added\nthat everyone who has climbed the\nTower appeared to have enjoyed it,\nand that he envisaged that the\nscheme would have a positive\npublicity effect for IC.\nFriday August 1st1986 Issue 745\n\n"

Construction had\nalready begun when it was realised\njust what was involved; the loss of\none toilet and no right of way\nbetween the spiral staircase and the\noffice. This effectively means that\nonly residents of Southside halls can\nhave access, through the door\nopposite the Selkirk end lifts.\nFELIX was unable to gain any\npositive response from the Estates\nsection on how Union members are\ngoing to be able to get into their\noffice in the future.\nPostgraduate\nGroup\nThe IC Union Postgraduate Group\nneeds better publicity, it decided at\nits recent Annual General Meeting\nheld on June 26th. The group\nrepresents all the Postgraduates at\nIC, both within the Union and on\nCollege Committees, although it has\nhad a history of low involvement.\nTrue to form, only about a dozen\nPG's turned up, to re-elect Gareth\nFish, Helan Brawell and Chris\nMartin as Chair, Secretary and\nTreasurer respectively. Sam\nChittendon was elected PG\nWomens rep.\nChris Martin was also elected to\nedit the Postgraduate Handbook, a Union publication with information\nfor both final year students\ninterested in Postgraduate Courses,\nand new postgraduates arriving at\nIC. He is looking for anyone who\nwould be interested in writing or\nbecoming involved in this\nproduction.\nGareth Fish, starting his second\nyear in office, urged all the\npostgraduates at IC to become\ninvolved in the group, and indicated\nthat a small amount of money was\navailable for anyone organising a Departmental Postgrad Party.

    "content": "News FELIX, Friday August 1st19868 FEUX Office On The Move\nConversion work has begun on the\nnew FELIX Office, which is to be\nre sited in the disused kitchen area\nbehind the Lounge. The design for\nthe new offices was drawn up by\narchitects Beresford Gray and\nPartners and the contractor is W F Fearman Ltd, the firm which also\nundertook the recent work on the\nold Botany-Zoology common\nroom. The cost of the work is to be\napproximately \u00a350,000, and the\nexpected completion date is August\n31st. The contractors are\nunderstood to be confident of\nmeeting this deadline, which will be\nessential if FELIX is to move offices\nearly in September. If the move is\nundertaken any later the production\nof FELIX, and other print Union\nwork, will be severely disrupted.\nThe preliminary site-clearing met\nwith an early set-back on\nWednesday when the contractors\nwere unable to switch off the\nelectricity and water mains for the\nLounge kitchen area, in order to\nallow drilling work to proceed.\nCollege Estates Section were unable\nto isolate the area as required.\nThe move of the FELIX office\nwill displace the Entertainments\nCommittee from their office and\nstoreroom behind the serving area\nin the Lounge. A replacement\nstoreroom will be built across the\nstage end of the Lounge, adjacent to\nSquat Ends\nthe new FELIX offices. A new office\nfor the Ents Committee is being\nbuilt at the rear of the UDH\nKitchens on the first floor of the\nUnion Building.\nThe cycling club work room will\nalso be moved as a result of the\nmove of the FELIX office and Beit\nHall TV lounge. A new TV\nLounge/party room is to be built in\nthe basement of Beit Hall Old\nHostel, involving the loss of three\nbedrooms and the laundry room.\n\"Beit Hall will extend its control on\nthe first floor and gain the cycling\nclub storeroom as a laundry room,\nso taking over the remaining space\nnot occupied by the new FELIX\noffice. It is currently intended to re-house cycling club in the old Tennis\nequipment storeroom, next to the\ntennis courts in Princes Gardens.\nCycling club secretary Martin Bell\nwas not aware of the loss of the\nstoreroom until two weeks ago.\nUnion Deputy President Jackie\nPierce has not yet been able to\nobtain a key for the old tennis store\nand so cannot say whether it will be\nsuitable as a cycling club work room. Union Glider In Doubt\nPolice were called to the former\nLibyan consulate in the early hours\nof Tuesday morning, after guests at\na party organised by the squatters\nbegan wrecking the building.\nAround 30 people wr ew arrested\nalthough most of these were later\nreleased. One person has been\ncharged with criminal damage.\nThe squatters were due to be\nmoved out after an eviction order\nwas granted in the High Court. By\nthe time of the party it seems that\nmost of the squatters had already\nmoved out of the building. Police\nwere informed of the disturbance by\nlocal residents and arrived at 58\nPrinces Gardens to find the building\nbeing vandalised. After calling for\nreinforcements they moved in to\nmake the arrests.\nThe consulate was guarded by\npolice throughout Tuesday and was\nboarded up on Wednesday. A private security firm are guarding\nthe building from inside. Local\nPolice Constable Andy Nimmons\nsaid that the damage done to the\nconsulate was estimated to be\nbetween \u00a31 million and \u00a32 million.\nFELIX was unable to get any\ncomment from the Libyan interest\nsection of the Saudi Arabian\nembassy or the Foreign Office.\nIC Union will not be able to afford a new glider this year, unless College\nadministration increase the amount\navailable to the Union on an\ninterest-free loan. It was originally\nintended to purchase a new glider\nwith \u00a313,000 borrowed from\nCollege. A further \u00a310,000 is also\nrequired on loan for the\nrefurbishment of the Union Snack\nBar, however, and College Deputy\nSecretary Mr Brian Lloyd Davies,\nuntil today the College Financial\nSecretary, has told Union Deputy\nPresident Jackie Pierce that only\n\u00a310,000 will be available to the\nUnion. Miss Pierce is hopeful that\nsome of the Lounge Bar\nrefurbishment costs will be covered\nby the Union's carry over, which\nmay make more money available\nfor the new glider. She expressed\ndisappointment in the response\nfrom College, bearing in mind the\n\u00a328,000 recently spend on\nalterations to the Queen's Tower,\nand the \u00a390,000 which it will cost to\nrefurbish the Sherfield refectory.\nMiss Pierce confirmed that the\nLounge bar refurbishment work\nwas preceding on schedule. The\nre decoration work is expected to\nbegin at the start of September, and\nthe floor covering will be laid and\nthe furniture delivered two weeks\nlater. Miss Pierce said that the\nLounge bar would be painted in a pink colour but added that 'they will\nlike it when they see it', and said that\nthe Union was going for a 'warmer\natmosphere' in the bar. She later\ncommuted her description of the\nchosen colour to 'not very pink'.\nUnion snack bar Manager Mr\nNorman Jardine was telephoned\nrecently to be asked his opinion on\nthe re decoration. He is understood\nto be severely indifferent to the\ncolour scheme.\nWalter Wins\nFellowship\nProfessor Walter T Welford of the\nPhysics Department has been\nelected a fellow of the Optical\nSociety of America. He has\ncontributed particularly in the fields\nof aberration theory, coherent\noptics and non-imaging concentrators. Pete's Party\nFormer IC Radio Station Manager\nand Computing Student Pete\nColeman made use of all his slick wit\nand charm when cautioned by a WPC during his 'term-time' stag\nnight at the\" Old Ship,\non Thursday June 19th. Mr\nColeman was congratulating\nhimself on having avoided arrest\nwhen the uniformed young lady\nremoved all her clothes.\nThe strip-o gram was arranged by\nformer FELIX editor Hugh\nSouthey who commented that 'Pete\nwas too drunk to get embarrassed'.\nMr Coleman described his present\nas 'quite a handful', before drinking\nanother half pint of creme de\nmen the and sliding gently under the\ntable.\nMr Coleman will be getting\nmarried on August 9th. FELIX\nwould like to wish him and his bride\nto be, Miss Mandy Thornton, all the\nvery best for the future.\nNUS Pledge\nThe London regional secretary of\nthe National Union of Students, Mr\nVaughen West, intends to get IC\nUnion into the NUS by the end of\nthe year. Mr Williams made this\nannouncement at Wye College,\nduring the training week attended\nby all three ICU Sabbticals. This\n'Pledge' follows the remarkable\nsuccess NUS had in persuading\nKings College (KQC) to affiliate to\nNUS.\nLesley\nWeighs In\nWelfare Officer Lesley Gillingham\nhas begun a diet for rag and aims to\nlose three stone by the end of next\nterm. At the 'before' weigh-in, Miss\nGillingham tipped tha scales at\nXXstone XXlbs. She will be re-weighed on the morning of the\nCollege Christmas Dinner.\nBuckley In\nThe Bar\nKevin Buckley is working as\ntemporary Union Bar Manager,\nfollowing the resignation of Mr\nMoore Lyttle. The position will\nshortly be advertised as a permanent\npost. The Union will be seeking the\nadvice of ULU administrator Mr\nPeter Anwyl, both in advertising the\njob and in making an appointment.\nMr Anwyl was consulted last year\nduring negotiations for the takeover\nof the Union Bar.\n\n"
