    "content": "4)\nRag Mag Rant\nDear Sir,\nIn reply to Nigel Atkinson's letter about the Rag Mag and\nthe lack of profit that it has\nmade in recent years, I quite\nagree that this situation is\nintolerable, and even\nmisleading to those who\npurchase it.\nHowever, this year the\nsituation is somewhat\ndifferent. In the past, each\ncopy has cost 20-24p to\nproduce, and had very little\nadvertising to offset this high\ncost. This is basically due to\nthe lack of effort put in by\nsome past Editors and\nAdvertising Managers. They\nhave used the same printer\nyear after year and not\nworked hard enough at the\nacquisition of advertising. By\nchanging to a provincial\nprinter (who charge much\nlower rates than London\nprinters), I have man ged to\nreduce the cost per copy to\n13.2p. In addition, around\neight pages out of 48 will\ncarry advertising which is not\nan excessive loss of space for\njokes, and which will reduce\nthe cost further to around 10pa copy\u2014the price a lot of\nestablishments pay for their\nflimsy covered bog roll type\nproductions. In this way, I have maintained the excellent\nquality , doubled the print run\nfor a price which is less than\nthat of our last production\ntwo years ago.\nI did wish to print 15,000\nthis year, since around 8,000\nwere sold on the RCSU Rag\nTours this year, and given an\nannual sales of around 4,000\nin College, plus afternoon\ntrips to to other London\nColleges, this figure is\nperfectly reasonable if the\ntours are repeated.\nHowever, the Rag\nCommittee has limited me to\n10,000 with a further 5,000\noption, which fortunately does\nnot affect the printing cost to\nany significant extent. I am\nconfident though that we will\neasily be able to sell 15,000\nnext year, and if we do, we\nshall make \u00a34-4,500 profit out\nof them. A situation vastly\nbetter than in the last few\nyears.\nI would like to add one\nmore, happier point. Next\nyears Rag Mag, wh i cn will be\navailable from the start of\nterm, carries an advertisement\nfor a FREE half-pint of Firkin\nBeer at any Bruce's Brewery\n| during Rag Week in\nNovember\u2014 so have a free\nbeer on the Rag Mag ?nd\nenjoy yourselves read i rg your\ncopy!\nTony Spencer\nRag Mag Editor\nObvious Space Fillers\nDear Sir,\nTo have a letter in the\n; columns of The Times is\nfrequently felt to be the duty\nof the distinguished; it is ever\nthe ambition of the obscure.\nI wonder into which\ncategory Mr David Rowe (The\nTimes 8.7.85) would put\nhimself.\n/ remain, Sir, your obedient\nservant,\nSir Choleric Splutter, Bart.\nDear Sir,\nIt has recently been brought\nto my attention that the son of\na certain former Nazi leader\nhas infiltrated in to the\nhierarchy of Imperial College\nUnion. I have reason to\nbelieve that he is a new breed\nof Aryan, known now as\nHairyun. He is short, rotund\nand has a thin black\nmoustache and goes under\nthe obviously pseudonym ical appellation of Quentin\nFontana. I am at this time\nunable to e lebo rate further on\nthe proof of this statement as\nI am currently in fear for my\nlife from his infamous 'hit\nsquad'.\nYours in hiding,\nArnold Swharzberg\n\u2022Quentin Fontana: Adolf\nHitler in disguise\nDear Sir,\nIt has come to my attention\nrecently that various\nprom in ant members of IC\nUnion have been doubting my\nc liam to be of Italian org in. Suggestions have been made\nthat my ancestor y is in fact\nAustrian being of decent,\nthrough an illegitimate line, of\nan Austrian army corporal\nwho used his rank as a stepping stone to become\nleader of the German National\nSocialists Party. I refute this\nallegation and strongly deny\nthat my purpose in becoming\nICU Hon Sec was to take a step nearer my ultimate\nambition of world rule by the\nmaster race of Boris Becker\nalthough that glorious day is\nnow nearer with that great\ntriumph only a few days old.\nI must stress that my\nsurname of Fontana is\nGenuine Italian and is not\nderived from Von Taner as\nhas been suggested.\nYours in rage,\nQuentin Fontana\nICU Hon Sec\nApathetic PGs\nDear Sir,\nI was delighted to see in the\nlast issue of FELIX the offer of\nregular postgraduate is s jes, subject to adequate help\nbeing forthcoming from the\npostgraduates at College.\nImagine how disheartened I vvd s when I learnt from you\nthat no postgraduates not\ncurrently involved had offered\nto h,p produce these issues\nand you therefore felt that,\nowing to lack of staff and an\napparent lack of enthusiasm\non the part of the Summer\nreadership, you would be\nunable to carry your offer\nthrough.\nSo come on all you\npostgraduates out there, you\ncomplain that the Union does\nnothing for you, but its hardly\nsurprising is it when the only\nresponse to one of the best\noffers made by FELIX in\nrecent years to postgraduates\nis met by a deafening silence?\nShow the Union that it is\nworth maintaining the\nPostgraduate Group, show\nthe Union that you care about\nsomething other than your\nwork by coming forward and\ngiving up a lunchtime or part\nof an evening to assisting on\nFELIX.\nFor if not one of you can be\nbothered to help, then you\nhave only yourselves to thank\nwhen, in time to come, the\nUnion (and maybe College)\ndevote their efforts towards\nundergraduates and leave the\npostgraduates to plough the\none furrow that they seem to\ndesire.\nYours faithfully,\nHugh Stiles\nChem Eng PG\nSir,\nThe news that you are to\nbring out regular PG issues\nduring the summer is\nappalling. Where on earth can\nPGs find the time to write\nletters?\nYours bitterly\nA Post-Graduate\nEd11o fia Industrial Society\nTo many the Carl Burgess's decision to stop recognising\nIndustrial Society as a Union\nsociety must seem very petty.\nIndustrial Society are one of\nthe biggest societies in the\nUnion, they do organise\nevents such s as the careers\nfair that are of benefit and\ncreate goodwill for Imperial\nCollege Union.\nIf you join a society,\nthough, you expect the\nmoney that you pay to join\nthe so cie it y to be properly\nmanaged. The Union has a duty to ensure that all clubs\ndo look after their money\nproperly. This means that it\nhas to impose financial\nprocedures on clubs so that it\ncan account for the money\nthe clubs spend. Industrial\nSociety claim that they need\nspecial treatment. A large\nnumber of clubs, societies etc\nalso have a large turnover\nand/or need access to their\nfunds over the summer. They\ncope with the Union's rules.\nThe Union has a duty to try\nand get Industrial Society to\nconform.\nIndustrial Society has been\nunder pressure for a long time\nto close their bank accounts\nand have been given plenty of\nnotice that if they didn't, they\nwould be disciplined. If\nanything the Union waited for\ntoo long before acting.\nHopefully, the Union's action has brought home to\nIndustrial Society how\nseriously the Union regards\ntheir failure to follow correct\nprocedures. Now it is\nimportant that Industrial\nSociety and Dave Kingston\nsort out this situation as soon\nas possible. It would be\nridiculous if such a large and\nsuccessful Society were to\nclose or remain separate from\nthe Union.\nPostgraduates\nIn the last editorial there was\nan appeal to postgraduates\nfor support so that FELIX\ncould come out ever two\nweeks over the summer. Since\nthen I 've been approached by\nthree or four PGs all of whom\ncurrently are heavily involved\nwith FELIX or IC Union.\nPostgraduates often complain\nthat the Union does little or\nnothing for them. This may be\ntrue, but can one blame the\nUnion if it gets the same sort\nof support that FELIX does\nwhen it attempts to work for\npostgraduates. Why not drop\nin the office and offer to help?\nWhy not come in and tell me\nwhat you would like to see in\nFELIX? I don't know what you\nwant. If I don't get some more\nsupport, there won't be\nregular issues of FELIX this\nsummer.\nCredits\nThis issue would have been\nimpossible to produce without\nDave Rowe, Nigel Atkinson,\nChris Martin, Hugh Stiles,\nRosemary Ivor-Jones, Tony\nChurchill, John Burgess, Nick\nShackley, Carl Burgess, Tony\nSpencer, Dave Kingston, and\nQuentin Fontana.\nFelix is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College\nUnion Publications Board and is printed by the Union Print Unit,\nImperial College, Prince Consort Road, London SW7: Telephone 01-589\n5111 Ext 3515: Editor Hugh Southey: Business Manager: J Martin Taylor:\nCopyright FELIX 1985.
