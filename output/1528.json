    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n22 FRIDAY 26 OCTOBER\nBecky Lane tells of the issues with ephemeral initiatives\nBecky Lane\nThe problem with \u201cGreen Week\u201d\ne are all guilty\nof not being as\ngreen as we could\nbe. I know for one\nthat I am guilty of\nchucking recyclables in my little desk\nbin at times when the journey to the\nrecycling bin (just outside of my of\ufb01ce) seems too far. Yet I just can\u2019t help\nbut feel that hosting a Green Week is\nnot the way to combat these behav-iours.\nTraditionally a Green Week takes\nthe form of a series of small events\nleading up to a big event at the end of\nthe week. This big change could be a\ncampus wide switch o\ufb00 of computers or some other green initiative. My\nfundamental problem with the concept of a \u2018Week\u2019 celebration whether\nit\u2019s about sustainability, LGBT rights\nor absolutely anything else; is that they\naren\u2019t fostering a change in attitude.\nSurely the point of any green initiative should be to embed sustainability\ninto the consciousness of everyone\nacross college both sta\ufb00 and students.\nInstead I feel we end up with grand\ntokenistic gestures which do little to\nchange attitudes. To be completely\nhonest after doing some research I\ncan\u2019t help but feel that Imperial College simply isn\u2019t doing enough to improve its environmental sustainability.\nEvery year People and Planet publish\na green league table of universities\nusing a ranking system based on environmental and ethical performance.\nI\u2019m aware that all league tables have\ntheir \ufb02aws (let\u2019s not start talking about\nthe NSS here) but in 2012 Imperial\nCollege was placed at 96th, this is a\nfall from a placing of 78th in 2011. The\nleague table looks at a plethora of different sustainability and environmental criteria and awards each institution\nwith a degree classi\ufb01cation \u2013 Imperial\ngot a 2.2. For an institution that strives\nfor excellence this is surely not what\nwe should be aiming for?\nWe have all heard the standard excuses when it comes to green issues;\n\u2018Turning my lights o\ufb00 won\u2019t make a\ndi\ufb00erence\u2019 and \u2018To gain excellence in\nresearch its necessary to leave this (in-sert scienti\ufb01c apparatus with high energy consumption here) on all night\u2019.\nThe point of this piece is not to argue\nwith either of these stances, merely\njust to say that I think if we want wide\nscale change we need buy in from a lot\nof individuals. I am not criticising College and putting the Union on a ped-estal. The Union recognises that it has\na way to go with green initiatives. But\nthis is something very much on the\nradar, the Union has just received a\nquote to increase the number of glass\nwashers further decreasing the use of\nplastic ski\ufb00s. It is not just the direct\nenvironmental e\ufb00ect that this will\nhave that it is important, it is the idea\nof establishing the role that sustainability plays in the culture of the Union.\nSo this is all very well and good,\nbut how to do go about \u2018changing\na culture\u2019 and making a di\ufb00erence,\nwell I would argue that is not for\nme to sit and dictate from my o\ufb03ce.\nTo e\ufb00ect change on a campus wide\nbasis we need student involvement\nat every level from the very begin-ning. This is the cheesy bit where I\nsay WE NEED YOU. Myself and the\nEnvironmental O\ufb03cer will be hosting a Green Forum at the Union on\nFriday 2nd November from 12.30-13.30 in Meeting room 8, Union\nbuilding. If you agree with the sentiment of this article come along, and\nimportantly if you don\u2019t then also\nplease come along to air your views\nand get the ball rolling. I promise\nto stop throwing my recyclables in\nmy desk bin, but that alone is not\nenough\u2026\nApparently being\ngreen means we\nget to have beer\nin a glass!\nW\n\u201c\u201d\nTokenistic\ngestures\nwhich do little\nto change\nattitudes.\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\u0003\b\u0005\n\u0005\n\b\u0007\u0003\u0005\u0003\n\u000e\n\u000f\u0010\u0010\u0002\u0011\b\n\u0003\u0006\n\u0005\u0003\u0004\u0002\u0011\u0012\n\b\u0005\u0002\u0003\n\u0004\u0002\u0011\n\b\u000f\u0006\u0007\u0003\b\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0003\u0006\u0003\u0007\b\u0005\u0004\n\u0005\n\u000e\n\u0003\u0007\u000f\u0010\n\u0011\u0002\u000f\u0005\u0012\u0005\u0013\u0014\u000f\n\u0015\n\u0016\u0017\u0003\u0004\n\u0018\u0005\n\u0003\u0007\u0003\u0005\u000e\n\u0007\n\u0018\n\u0016\u0017\u0003\u0004\n\u0018\n\u0005\n\u0019\u001a\u0019\u0005\u001b\u0011\u001c\u001d\u0005\u0019\u001d\u0019\u001d\n\u001e\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0001\u0005\u0006\u0007\u0005\u0001\u0006\b\u0003\n\u0001\u0005\u0004\n\u0006\n\u000e\n\u001f\u0007\u0003\u0003\u0005\n\u0014\u001e\u001e\u0018\u0005\n\u0004\u0005\u0015!\b\u0002\u0003\u0005\n\u0007\u0005\n\u0014\u001e!\u0005\n\u0005\u0016\u0018\u0005\n\u0004\u001e\n\u0004\u0003\u0005\u0006\n\u0014\n\u0016\u0007\u0005\"\u0003#\u0018\n\u0003\n\"\"\"$\u0004\n\u001e\n\u0004\u0003$\n\u0007\n$\u0016!\n\n"

Such experiences\nprompted Ben, a \ufb01nal year student at\nBournemouth University, to start his\nvery own online business. Unishack.\ncom allows students to rate their accommodation in order to help those\ncurrently looking to rent. Felix had the\nopportunity to pick Ben\u2019s brains about\nrunning his own business whilst still\nat University.\nIs this your \ufb01rst shot at starting a\nbusiness, and have you always aspired\nto start one yourself?\nWhen I was 15, I started a computer\nsupport company that specialised in\n\u2018At Home Support\u2019. This quickly became a small successful business however after a couple of years I decided\nthat I would go travelling for \ufb01ve\nmonths before going to University. I\nhave always had a keen business acumen and a passion for web technolo-gies, the perfect pair for starting Uni\nShack.\nHad the idea Uni Shack not taken\no\ufb00, what do you reckon you would be\ndoing now instead?\nMy plan B has always been to set up\na Web Development/Design company\n\u2013 but hopefully I won\u2019t have to worry\nabout that!\nHow did you go about building your\nteam, and how many people work for/\nat Uni Shack?\nI believe a great strength is to know\nyour weaknesses, and once you know\nthem you can build your team around\nthat. Following that analysis, I\u2019ve\npicked up the phone and got in contact with a few friends who I know\nalso have a passion for business. The\nteam at Uni Shack comprises of four\npeople, including myself \u2013 two in\ntechnical and two in marketing and\nPR.\nHow have you found balancing your\nacademic commitments with running\nyour own business?\nIt really helps staying organised! My\nUniversity work is quite heavy at the\nmoment as I\u2019m in my \ufb01nal year, so\nthat takes priority. However I\u2019m really\npassionate about Uni Shack, so the\nmajority of my spare time is spent on\nthat. I\u2019m quite fortunate that the business relies on user generated content\nso most of my time is spent on promotion and further site development.\nHow are you planning on making\nsubstantial revenues from the website\n(or what other goals do you have for\nthe business)?\nOur business model operates on a\nseries of di\ufb00erent revenue streams,\nsuch as standard business to consumer advertising, and advertising the letting agents/landlord contact details.\nSoon letting agents and landlords will\nbe able to add a plugin to their site,\nthis plugin will show the rating and\ncomments of a property.\nWould you advise students to start\na business whilst still studying or wait\nuntil they have more experience/\ufb01nancial security?\nI believe that if you have a good\nenough idea and it is realistic then\nwhy wait? If you have a fantastic idea\nbottled up until you have more expe-rience, then another company could\ncome in and get the market before\nyou \u2013 that wouldn\u2019t be good!\nYoung entrepreneurs often tend to\nrun before they can walk. What would\nyou say are the best \ufb01rst steps to take\nwith an exciting new business idea?\nI\u2019d say that the most important step\nis to do your homework \ufb01rst. You\nneed to understand the market for\nyour idea, and also where your main\nrevenue streams will come from.\nWriting a business plan from the start\nis always a good idea.\nWhat has been the biggest hurdle so\nfar, and have you ever considered giving up?\nThe development of the site was\nthe easy part - the hurdle was getting\npeople to use the site. With a limited\nbudget that wasn\u2019t easy. Uni Shack is a\ngood idea so I knew with persistence\nstudents would eventually start rat-ing. With the right team on board and\nusing social media to our advantage,\nUni Shack started to grow.\nHave you ever run into issues with\nletting agents and landlords objecting\nUni Shack? How do you ensure ratings\nremain fair and reliable?\nIt has always been our number one\npriority at Uni Shack to be neutral.\nWe strive to keep things amicable\nbetween the student and the letting\nagent or landlord. We ensure ratings\nare fair and reliable by monitoring\neach and every review that is submit-ted, we will not approve a review that\ncontains profanities for example. We\nare currently developing a portal that\nallows letting agents and landlords to\nlog on, and comment on the student\nreviews of their properties. So by doing all of this, we haven\u2019t run into any\nissues with landlords or letting agents.\nAre students not running the risk of\nreceiving no/very poor references from\nprevious landlords if they rate their\nproperties badly?\nProtecting the identity of the reviewer is the answer to this. We do\nnot disclose their email address, tenancy year, or any other information\nthat can relate back to them. We always advise any reviewer to express\ntheir opinion in a way that does not\nidentify them. Plus the student can\nalways rate their property once they\nhave left.\nWhat do you currently love and hate\nabout the \ufb02at you\u2019re currently living\nin?\nThis is probably the best rented\nproperty that I have lived in! My girl-friend, Faye and I had a strict list of\nrequirements that we wouldn\u2019t budge\non, it helps to know what things to\nwatch out for when looking for a new\nplace. I\u2019d say the best thing about our\n\ufb02at is its town centre location, the\nonly thing we really disliked was the\nw\nGot a question for\nBen?\nAspiring student entrepreneur? Business\nSchool student? Or just plain curious about\nwhat it takes to start your own business?\nSend in your questions to:\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk and have them\nanswered by Ben himself!\nI believe\na great\nstrength is\nto know your\nweaknesses,\nand once you\nknow them\nyou can build\nyour team\naround that\n\u201c\nI believe\nI belie\na great\nstrengt\nto know\nweakne\nand onc\nam\nam\nthat\nthat\nlime green colour of the bathroom, a\ntin of magnolia soon sorted that out!\n\n"

I am\nnot Tim Arbabzadah, Master of Science. Those five seconds of fame on\nthe stage were fun. Although, I didn\u2019t\nreally expect to be the first Master of\nScience graduate to receive a degree.\nThis meant I had to nervously try to\nhope that I remembered how to walk\nand shake hands with people, without\nbeing drowned out by the crowd in\nfront of me.

Enjoy university! Really, it\u2019s\nthe best years of your life if you make it\nthat. Yeah it\u2019s a clich\u00e9 (that\u2019s what late\nnights do to you: makes you real off\nthese types of phrases), but it really is\ntrue.

Lots of our alumni give mon-ey, please model yourself on them\nby giving us money. Nothing wrong\nwith asking us for donations and all\nthat, but, dude, seriously, give us like\na maybe longer than a two minute\nsegue into that. Or perhaps just don\u2019t\nmention it right away.

He must have\nthought it was a notable low when\nthousands booed him at the Paralympics. In fact, it must have been pretty\natrocious ever since his parents were\ntold by doctors there is no cure for a\ncomplete lack of empathy. Still, he\nnever could have thought it come to\nthis, no one could ever conceive that\ntheir life could hit the depths it did\nthat ominous day en route to Euston:\na stranger high \ufb01ved a train inspector\nfor giving him a ticket.\nFor those unaware of this debacle,\nlet me recite an admittedly dramatized version of the story as spun by\nthe journalists the next day. George\nOsborne did not deign to arrive for\nhis prebooked train, presuming that\nhe could worm his way onto any\ntrain he wanted with any ticket and\na sickly smile. Not wishing to waste\nhis gaze on the dirty common folk, he\nskulked into First Class on the train\nof his choosing and sent o\ufb00 a faceless\nminion o\ufb00 to inform the blue-collars\nwhat had been decided. However, one\nhero took a stand and demanded that\nan appropriate fee (costing 0.0005x\nthe price of putting a child through\nEton). After an argument, the villain\nof the piece admitted defeat, coughed\nup, and the hero was justly rewarded\n(with a high \ufb01ve) for ensuring equality for all.\nLooking at this from an objective\npoint of view is admittedly di\ufb03cult\nwith the situation revolving around\nsomeone so thoroughly unlikable, so\nI\u2019d like everyone to imagine that this\nexact situation happened to Stephen\nFry.\nDue to circumstances completely\noutside his control, Stephen had to\nAdam Clancy\nFRIDAY 26 OCTOBER\n20\nI\nTraingate - First Class fuss\nboard a later train and being an a\ufb00able\nchap, he sent a co-worker/friend (pre-sumably Alan Davies) to go and let the\nconductor know that he was awfully\nsorry but his ticket wasn\u2019t technically\nvalid. With all the dastardly work that\nhad piled around him, Stephen took\nthe opportunity to \ufb01nd a table and\nsome peace and quiet in \ufb01rst class before setting about reading through his\nscript of Othello. When the inspector came, Alan went and sorted it out\n(which cost \u00a3160! The cheek of rail\ncompanies these days!) while Stephen\ncarried on reciting, none the wiser.\nWe do occasionally edit letters and comments we receive to\nimprove spelling, grammar, and clarity of expression.\nOnline\nOur pick of the best banter from felixonline.co.uk\nIn this situation, you can see that\neverything could have been handled better, but Fry was certainly\nnot to blame and it would likely lead\nto a witty tweet by the man himself rather than \ufb01restorm of media\ndriven hate that came down around\nOsborne. As such, I honestly don\u2019t\ncare that he wanted to use \ufb01rst class\n(I prefer it - there\u2019s much more legroom and ne\u2019er a screaming child).\nAs such, we shouldn\u2019t hold this\nagainst Osborne, particularly when\nthere\u2019s so much legitimate stu\ufb00 he\u2019s\ndone wrong.\nAdam Clancy asks if it\u2019s fare to criticise the Chancellor\nIn response to: \u201cChanging the Rules: Why Bother?\u201d (19th October)\nYou are totally missing the point that virtually no one outside the\nUnion clique cares. All the overwhelming majority want from their\nStudent Union (which is demonstrated by the dire turnout year after\nyear) is a live-and-let-live attitude and maybe an a\ufb00ordable drink in a\npleasant atmosphere. They get neither. Both Presidential candidates\npromise to abolish entry fee. Entry fee still exists. Turnout in elections\nfor the ubiquitous \u2018O\ufb03cer\u2019 roles is regularly less than 5%. No easing\nof anti-alcohol policies - just a proliferation of signage telling us how\nold we need to be to buy it. 568 starts closing the shutters an hour\nbefore closing time - on the busiest nights of the week. One person\nserving in the Old Union Bar on the rare occasions it\u2019s open. No option for smokers to buy tobacco in the evening at *their* student un-ion, unfortunate given the no re-entry policy (which was meant to be\nabolished, see above). Forgive us if we don\u2019t get excited about totally\ninconsequential changes to the \u2018constitution\u2019.\n(Chistopher Kaye)\n\u201cI completely accept, that, at the minute, the changes will a\ufb00ect\nvery few people.\u201d Well, there you go - you are almost without man-date. Try changing something which people actually care about, like\nthe union entry fees. Forget all the crap about \u201cthings like that take\ntime\u201d. Yes they do take time, but only the negative amount of time\nrequired to not set up a stall and to not ask for money.\n(Anonymous)\nChristopher Kaye, I\u2019m sorry you feel that the atmosphere at the Union isn\u2019t very nice. Given the operating costs though I hardly think\n\u2018una\ufb00ordable\u2019 describes the Union\u2019s drink prices. The Entry fee was\nscrapped between 20:00-21:30 on Wednesdays, and after that was\nlowered to \u00a32 from \u00a33.50. I had to put a lot of work in to get that to\nhappen as it a\ufb00ects the Union\u2019s budget and isn\u2019t something that can\nbe \u2018just changed\u2019. This is something that I wish all candidates knew\nwhen running. I have the ability to a\ufb00ect *next* year\u2019s budget when\nit is written in February. RBKC licensing authority and the law dictate what rules we have to have in our bar, and, given that College ID\ncards for U18s don\u2019t carry red boxes around them this year we can\u2019t\nuse that as a proof of age check. Would you rather we lose our li-cence? Changes to the structure are important so that the Union can\ncontinue to exist. No changes and the trustees may walk out. Then\nthere\u2019ll be no union for you to complain about.\n(Paul Beaumont, Union President)\nPaul Beaumont, I\u2019m delighted that you will be scrapping entry charges\nfor the next academic year (you de\ufb01nitely will, won\u2019t you?). I\u2019m sure\nMr Clegg empathises with the situation you\u2019ve found yourself in. I\ndon\u2019t. It may be helpful in your role as Union President if you realised\nthat the Union Building at Beit is in fact in Westminster City Council\u2019s\njurisdiction and not RBKC at all. For your convenience, I will link you\nto the licensing document, on Westminster Council\u2019s website, here:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/unionlicence If you would like to point out where\nit requires, as a condition of the licence, the Soviet-style display of\npatronising \u201cAre you under 21?\u201d signage I would be grateful. I would\nalso be grateful if you responded to the other points I raised: lack of\nfags, the early closure of half the bar (presumably for the convenience\nof the paid sta\ufb00) and understa\ufb03ng in the Old Union Bar.\n(Christopher Kaye)\nChristopher Kaye, scrapping the entry fee outright this year would\nhave lost the union a lot of money. The idea is that we\u2019d reduce it and\nmove the timings back for the \ufb01rst few weeks to see if more people\ncame etc. As I said, I can\u2019t change the budget for this year, but I can for\nnext, and it is something that I think should change in the budget for\nnext year, yes. I don\u2019t deal with the licensing, so sorry for my mistake\n- my point still stands that the bar operates within the law, not rules\nwe make up for fun. The signs are meant to be informative and were\nput there as it was thought many would be o\ufb00ended at being asked\nfor ID at \u2018their own bar\u2019. Selling cigarettes in the Union building itself\nhasn\u2019t happened for years because of the possibility that it encourages\nsmoking whilst people are drunk.\n(Paul Beaumont, Union President)\nPaul Beaumont, there are a couple of points I\u2019d like you to clarify - did\nyou know at the time you made your manifesto promise about abolishing entry fees that you wouldn\u2019t be able to implement it? Or had\nyou just not bothered to research it? Those are the only two possibilities are far as I can tell. What exactly is wrong with intelligent people\nchoosing to smoke? I didn\u2019t realise it was the Student Union\u2019s job to\nlegislate on morality.\n(Christopher Kaye)\nIn response to: \u201cHead-to-head: Welfare - Are the Coalition reforms fair?\u201d (19th October)\nSurely if you\u2019re giving people less money than you were originally\ngiving them, then that\u2019s still kind, rather than a punishment; it\u2019s just\nslightly less kind than you were being previously. Sheldon\u2019s article\nContinued...\nI\u2019d like\neveryone to\nimagine that\nthis exact\nsituation\nhappened to\nStephen Fry.\n\u201d\npened to\npened to\nphen Fry.\nhen Fry.\n\n"

Russell Hall, one of the co-founders of Hailo spoke to us about\ntheir success story and what makes\nHailo so popular, to a point that even\ncelebrities and serial entrepreneurs\nsuch as James Caan are tweeting about\nits brilliance! Russell explained how\ngetting Hailo to where it is today was\nnot easy, nor was it a smooth sailing\nprocess. They had to get rid of a tech\nteam that were not delivering and had\nto pitch their ideas to and convince\nnumerous investors that their app was\ngoing to work. They had tremendous\nbelief and con\ufb01dence in their idea and\nstrived to make it a success.\nHailo is a rapidly expanding mobile\napp that enables you to hail a black\ncab through your smartphone and pay\nfor it via credit or debit card, or cash\nwith no extra charges or booking fees.\nA brilliant yet simple idea, that brings\nmore business to London taxi drivers\nand eliminates the need for passengers to frantically hail taxis!\nThe app was envisioned by three\nLondon taxi drivers, Russell, Terry\nand Gary as well as three Internet en-trepreneurs. They managed to raise\n$20 million from various investors and\nbackers including Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m,\nthe co-founder of Skype. Other investors include Accel Partners and Wellington Partners, who have funded\nhigh pro\ufb01le companies such as Facebook and Spotify. You know you have\nsomething good if such people are\nbacking your product.\nHaving initially been introduced in\nLondon, the app has now made its way\nto Dublin, Toronto and most recently\nBoston with plans to expand stateside\nin Chicago and New York. The app is\ntailored to a certain city based on its\nregulations and people in order to enjoy the most success. In London itself,\n20 per cent of the black cab drivers are\nregistered with Hailo, a \ufb01gure that is\nlikely to grow.\nThe key to this success has been the\nfact that they place the same amount\nof care and emphasis on their drivers\nas they do on their customers. They\nhave a great communication system\nto help drivers understand and use the\napp and also listen to their feedback\nto constantly adapt, change and solve\nproblems that may arise. Taxi drivers are drawn to Hailo because of the\ngreat driver experience that they \ufb01nd\nto be more sociable and pro\ufb01table.\nBesides this, the app has also been\ndesigned and developed by leading\ndesigners formerly working at companies such as Google. It even has a\nfeature that allows passengers to rate\ntheir drivers ensuring the best service\nis always provided.\nWhat attracts the customers to the\napp is its simplicity and ease of use;\nyou are never more than two taps\naway from getting a taxi. It eliminates\nthe need to carry cash around for\ntaxis. As Russell explained, when you\nhave no cash in hand, you either cannot take a taxi or are forced to go to an\nATM to withdraw. Hailo prevents this\nand makes everyday activities such\nas shopping much easier. Hailo also\nprides itself on the fact that it charges\nthe customer only the taxi fare, and\nthis gives them a major advantage over competitors\nsuch as Addison Lee,\nwhere booking\nfees ap-ply.\nHailo\nhas received\ne x -t r e m e l y\npositive reviews from app users, with\nan average 5 star rating from over 1000\nreviews. With such great features and\nexcellent feedback from customers\nwho use the app there is no saying\nhow far this app will go and how big\nit will become. Future plans include\nintroducing the app Far East in Tokyo,\nwhere the taxi business is massive and\nso is the use of technology and smart-phones. It is certainly exciting times\nfor those at Hailo.\nFor those of you who\nare uncertain\nas to what\nS t a r t u p\nMondays\nare, they\nare a series of\nweekly\ns o c i a l s\nh o s t e d\nby Imperial Entrepreneurs, in which entrepreneurs are invited to give talks about\ntheir companies to students. The attendees have the opportunity to hear\nhow businesses such as Hailo, were\nset up, organised and run to become\na widely downloaded and used appli-cation. Those in attendance are also\ngiven a chance to further socialise\nand network with the entrepreneurs\nbehind London\u2019s hottest startups at\nthe Eastside Bar. With Hailo, we were\nlucky enough to have the drinks sponsored by our speakers. We can\u2019t always\nguarantee that though!\nImperial Entrepreneurs\u2019 next Startup Monday event on the 29th of October will involve Hayley Quinn, a dating coach, who will give advice on how\nto be more con\ufb01dent and memorable\nwhen meeting people in di\ufb00erent\nplaces such as at networking events. If\nthe Hailo event was anything to go by,\nthis one is guaranteed to be a success!\nL\n\u201d\n\u201c\nThink you could do a better job than the Chancellor? Reckon\nApple\u2019s marketing strategy is all wrong?\nLET US KNOW!\nSend in your ideas and articles to business.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nOr just come down to the office for a chat, we get lonely sometimes.\nThe app was\nenvisioned by\nthree London\ntaxi drivers,\nRussell, Terry\nand Gary as\nwell as three\nInternet entrepreneurs\n\n"

    "content": "\u201cKeep the Cat Free\u201d\nIssue 1528 felixonline.co.uk\n26/10/12\nThe Diamond Jubilee Regatta was held\nover the weekend of the 20-21st October at the scene of the summer\u2019s Olympic rowing frivolities, Dorney Lake. The\nprospect of a major 2 kilometre sprint\nevent just three weeks into the autumn\nterm struck fear into even the hardiest\nIC rower. However, despite the shock to\nthe system, it turned out to be a hugely\nsuccessful event. Imperial College Boat\nClub arrived in force, storming their\nway up the medal table and \ufb01nishing\nsecond in the Victor Ludorum at the\nend of the weekend.\nCompetition at the Regatta was \ufb01erce.\nUsually at events ICBC are used to racing other crews of a similar standard:\nBUCS for example. However the revised format meant that all categories\nof crew would race each other, pitting\nlightweights against heavyweights and\nseniors against us little under-23s. Winners of respective categories would then\nbe worked out at the end of racing based\non overall rankings. In addition Olympians who had raced over the summer\nwere encouraged to attend and race for\ntheir home clubs. This meant that we\nwere lining up against the actual big\ndeals, in a rowing equivalent of you racing Usain Bolt with one man and his dog\nwatching from the stands of the Olympic Stadium.\nImperial\u2019s all student rowers came away\nfrom the event with two gold medals,\nin the under-23 lightweight double and\nthe under-23 men\u2019s eight. Lightweight\ndream-team Wilf Kimberley and Tim\nRichards won the gold, having both attending the under-23 World Championships over the summer. They were\npushed hard by Myles Holbrough and\nPaul Jones, also of Imperial, who \ufb01nished second in the under-23 lightweight doubles category. This excellent\none-two meant BUCS points galore and\na high \ufb01nal placing, with the doubles\n\ufb01nishing 8th and 10th overall.\nOn the Sunday the student men\u2019s 8 were\nracing for the \ufb01rst time this year. The\ncrew of Hal Bradbury, Sam Cottrell, Jonny Rankin, Ali Hudson, Ben SpencerJones, Henry Goodier, Wilf Kimberley\nand Tim Richards with cox Ellie Smith\nhad extremely tough competition. In\ntheir semi-\ufb01nal they found themselves\no\ufb00 the pace in the \ufb01rst 1000m, needing\na top 3 \ufb01nish to make the A-\ufb01nal. The\nboys put in a powerful push at halfway,\ngetting their bows in front of Newcastle University and into the critical third\nplace spot. Knocking Newcastle out\nalso meant that Imperial were the only\nunder-23 crew in the \ufb01nal, automatically getting them a gold medal! In celebration strokeman Kimberley pulled\nout a huge chocolate cake, which many\nof the crew got stuck into. Coach Stu\nWhitelaw struggled to give his pre-race\nchat for the \ufb01nal as he couldn\u2019t keep his\nhands o\ufb00 the \u2018dirty beast\u2019 and was seen\nwol\ufb01ng slices and slices of cake down\nafter the boys boated. In the \ufb01nal the\ncrews lined up: Leander, Cambridge,\nMolesey, Oxford Brookes, Imperial and\nTideway Scullers. The Imperial crew\nwere the only boat not containing any\nOlympians, and the Leander boat actually had \ufb01ve medals from the London\n2012 games! IC managed to hang on\nfor a 5th place \ufb01nish overall. Two-man\nSam Cottrell had given so much that he\ndidn\u2019t have the energy to hold on to his\noar once they had crossed the line. It got\ncaught under-water and he \u2018crabbed\u2019\nending up pinned backwards with a\nhandle in his face until the boat slowed\nto a halt. Although not the most stylish\nway to \ufb01nish a race, Cottrell said that \u2018at\nleast everyone thought that I had pulled\nhard\u2019\n.\nThe beauty of the new format meant\nthat in the semi-\ufb01nal of the men\u2019s quad,\nPaul Jones found himself looking across\nat his opposite man in the London RC\nboat, who happened to be Bill Lucas,\na 6ft6 GB Olympic Beast. Paul, who\nin normal terms is average sized but\nin rowing circles is a midget, laughed\no\ufb00 the size di\ufb00erence in typical Gallic\nfashion however this time con\ufb01dence\nwasn\u2019t enough unfortunately. The quad\nof Myles Holbrough, Paul, Rory Sullivan\nand Dan Powell missed out on the A\ufb01nal but managed a positive 4th in the\nunder-23 category. Another quad containing Simon Steele, rowing with last\nyear\u2019s captain Paddy Hudson \ufb01nished\n6th in senior quads.\nImperial medic and London 2012\nrower Mel Wilson stormed to victory\nin the women\u2019s 8 in a composite crew\nalso containing 4 other ICBC mem-bers. Mel had a very successful sum-mer, coming 6th at the Olympics in the\nwomen\u2019s quad after taking a year out\nof studying to focus on the games. She\nhas been back training with the squad\nat IC this year and has been showing\no\ufb00 some very \ufb02ashy kit out on the river!\nThe ICBC non-students achieved other\nexcellent results at the regatta, with victory in the women\u2019s four and alumni,\nlady-killer and Olympic spare Adam\nFreeman-Pask stroking a heavyweight\nquad to 5th in the A-\ufb01nal.\nThere was success for the women\u2019s double of Lizzie Cottrell and Georgie Phillips. They \ufb01nished 3rd out the university\ncrews and 6th overall in women\u2019s dou-bles, adding to the Boat Club\u2019s early season haul of BUCS points. ICBC also had\na student double of Annie Hooper and\nLily Beadle \ufb01nishing 7th in this event.\nFurther women\u2019s success came with a\nstudent crew of Louise Connell, Harriet Cross, Caterina Buizza and Hannah\nPatterson \ufb01nishing 5th in the A \ufb01nal of\nthe women\u2019s coxless fours, an excellent\nresult against some very strong crews.\nThe BUCS points are already racking\nup, the medals are coming in and it\nlooks like it could be the year for ICBC.\nThe next event for the crews is the Toga\nParty this coming Saturday, followed by\nthe small matter of GB trials a couple\nof weeks after. It is great to see so many\nnovices down the Boat Club at the mo-ment, and we look forward to more\nsuccess for ICBC in the coming months.\nIC Rowers get more golds\nSPORT\nICURFC brings 15% off supplements for all students! bit.ly/imperialprotein\nRory Sullivan Sports Writer\nOn Saturday the Imperial swimming\nteam travelled to Cambridge to take\npart in the \ufb01rst gala of the year, and\nit was a good meet but was not without hitches. Our captain, after telling\nus which trains to book, booked hers\nfor half an hour later, and when we did\narrive in Cambridge Tom Trimnell\nassured us he knew how to get to the\npool so we started walking. We took\nthe scenic route round the outskirts of\nCambridge and an hour later, we arrived at the pool. After our little adventure round Cambridge we didn\u2019t\nneed to warm up and so the competition began.\nThere were good individual swims\nfrom all the freshers and the team as\na whole came 5th. Some outstanding\nswims were by Michael Ingram in the\n100m butter\ufb02y and Fraser Gordon in\nthe 100m freestyle who both came in\nthe top three in all their races.

I certainly have, and would love\nto be able to watch some of the more\ninteresting ones back later. The idea\nof reading and recording dreams has\nbeen the preserve of science \ufb01ction,\nbut as our understanding of the brain\nimproves, it is getting closer to real-ity.\nA group of researchers in Japan,\nled by Yukiyasu Kamitani, have previously used functional magnetic\nresonance imaging (fMRI) to identify\nwhich image a subject is looking at.\nLast week, they presented an extension of this work, where they looked\nat the dreaming brain.\nfMRI was used to record the brain\nactivity of three volunteers whilst\nthey slept. When the researchers detected brain waves associated with\ndreaming, they woke the volunteer and asked them what they had\ndreamt of. In this way, they were able\nto collect data on which parts of the\nbrain are active when dreaming of a\nnumber of di\ufb00erent objects. The volunteers were then shown images of\nthese objects whilst awake and their\nbrain activity recorded. By comparing the data gathered whilst awake\nwith that from the dreaming brain,\nthe volunteers were able to predict\nthe content of the dreams. For ex-ample, they could predict whether\nor not a man was present in a dream\nwith an accuracy of 75-80%.\nAt the moment, the method is limited to a few common objects, such\nas \u2018man\u2019, \u2018woman\u2019 and \u2018computer, but\nwith more data the number of objects\nthat can be identi\ufb01ed could increase.\nInterestingly, areas involved in visual processing and object identi\ufb01cation in the group\u2019s earlier work were\nalso found to be active whilst dream-ing, implying dreams are interpreted\nby the brain in a similar way to images from the eyes.\nWhile we may still be some way o\ufb00\nrecording our dreams, this work is\ncertainly a step in the right direction\nand could help to understand why we\ndream and how dreaming is related\nto brain activity.\nTractor Beams: A possibility?\nResearchers at the University of New\nYork have conducted the \ufb01rst experimental demonstration of a tractor beam\n\u2013 a travelling wave that comes from one\ndirection and pulls its target towards the\nbeam\u2019s origin.\nUp until now, beams have been used\nto move particles by working as optical tweezers and optical conveyor belts.\nOptical tweezers work over small dis-tances, trapping particles for manipula-tion; whilst optical conveyor belts work\nover larger distances and use two opposing beams to set up a \u201cconveyor belt\u201d\nof light to move trapped particles.\nThe tractor beam is di\ufb00erent from\nthese other methods because it has been\nused over much larger distances \u2013 micrometers instead of picometers \u2013 and\ncomes from only one direction.\nA tractor beam works by redirecting more photons downstream from\nthe target particle than upstream once\nthey\u2019ve hit the target \u2013 the force of being\nhit by photons is weaker than the force\nimparted by the redirected photons\nmoving downstream, and so the particle\nWriter\nJacob Ward\nis forced upstream towards the beam\u2019s\npoint of origin. How did the researchers\ndo this? They used a Bessel beam.\nA Bessel beam is a beam that doesn\u2019t\nrefract at all and \u201cself-heals\u201d \u2013 after hitting a target, the beam reforms on itself\ndownstream. The tractor beam just\ndemonstrated works by \ufb01ring a Bessel\nbeam in the shape of a circular ring,\nwith another ring-shaped Bessel beam\naround the \ufb01rst.\nThe second beam interferes with the\n\ufb01rst, causing it to rapidly change in\nintensity and snag the target particle,\nmoving it upstream. The researchers\nwere even able to use two tractor beams\nto simultaneously move one particle upstream and another downstream.\nWhilst these beams are working over\nmuch smaller distances than in Sci-Fi,\nthey\u2019re still a revolutionary method for\nworking on microscopic objects.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.163903\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.58.1499\nScenes like this from your favourite video games could soon\nbe reality...\nKilgore Trout/Eve Online Pictures\n\n"

    "content": "TECHNOLOGY\nTechnology Editor: Jason Parmar\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWindows 8 out TODAY\nindows 8 came\nout today, and the\nmedia world is\nbuzzing to see if\nthis will make or\nbreak Microsoft\u2019s future. In the past Microsoft consumers faced more choices\nof varieties of Windows than in a trip\nto Subway! Starter, Home Basic, Home\nPremium and, and, and, were often subject to intense discussion of suitability\nand productivity. This time round, Windows 8 only comes in 3 varieties with\nvery similar capabilities, which seems\nto be a plus. However, the big question\nis \u201cwhat is the di\ufb00erence\u201d and \u201cwhat variety do you, as a student, want?\u201d\nBefore we go into a deep anal-ysis, I do have to warn you that you cannot actually purchase the RT (standing\nfor \u201cRuntime\u201d) standalone. So, if you really like this \ufb02avour of windows 8, then\nyou will have to buy a laptop, hybrid\nor tablet that has this installed from\nthe o\ufb00. Fortunately for you, since RT is\ncheaper to license for Microsoft, these\ndevices will most likely cost less.\nSo how does each \ufb02avour\nlook? Actually, they all look identical\nwith their metro-style interface and\nmulti-coloured slabs. This \u201cmetro\u201d (al-though not o\ufb03cially called metro due to\nGerman \ufb01rm Metro AG complaining)\ninterface is Microsoft\u2019s bid to remain\ncurrent and cool, and will be uniform to\nphones, tablets and computers. However Windows 8, and the Pro version,\nwill both be able to revert to the desktop interface that we have loved and\nused since it \ufb01rst came out in Windows\n95, so if you are not sure about metro, at\nleast you do get to go back to old times\nonce in a while. Sadly, Windows RT is\nlimited to the new interface, so if you\nare addicted to your beloved old-school\ninterface, this is strike one against RT.\nWhat will they be able to do?\nLet\u2019s start o\ufb00 with RT. It is the \u201ccheapest\u201d version, and thus comes with the\nleast amount of features. Surprisingly\nthough, Microsoft O\ufb03ce (i.e. Word,\nExcel etc) is thrown in with this variety,\nwhich is very attractive, as it means being able to actually do work on a tablet/\nhybrid. This is about it for the pros for\nRT, as it is quite limiting. Any programs\nthat you want to run that are either old-er, or do not come from the windows\napp store, will not run. This means no\nSteam, Chrome/Firefox (circle your\npreference), iTunes etc. etc. (the list is\nendless), will not run on your device.\nThis is depressing for gamers, as well as\npeople who want any kind of freedom\nin their environment. Therefore Windows 8 (or Pro) will be better for you,\nbecause here at least you will be able to\nrun alternate programs, as well as met-ro-style apps.\nSo why would Microsoft release such a limiting OS? It\u2019s all about\nhardware and the corresponding price.\nRT is based on ARM (Chips built by the\nBritish company ARM Holdings), and\nthese processors are not as powerful\nas their Intel cousins. ARM processors\ncannot run x86, upon which most programs are built. However ARM chips\nare cheaper, and thus Microsoft was\nable to introduce a cheaper OS. The\nother two varieties run on Intel chips,\nand thus there is no change from the\nnorm.\nNow, which one is for you?\nPersonally, I would say that RT is for\nthose in the market for a new device,\nwho don\u2019t really care that much about\nproductivity or usability, and who want\nto have the bonus of having O\ufb03ce pre-installed. Since you will not be able to\nbuy RT on its own, keep in mind that\nyou have to keep the price of your tab-let/phone in mind, which might not be\nthat cheap. The normal Windows 8 /\nPro is for all those who are happy with\ntheir current computer and want to\nsimply upgrade to the latest instalment\n(about \u00a350 - \u00a380).\nMost of you who will upgrade will\nprobably want to keep most of their old\nprograms, so this seems to be the logical choice!\nMax Eggl gives you the low-down on Windows 8, RT & Pro\nFRIDAY 26 OCTOBER\nSome of us are not normal people (but\nthen again, we are Imperial students).\nWe live on the bleeding edge of technology where we thrive on using the latest\nand greatest of gadgets and software.\nWe readily consume new technology\nand are willing to learn and adapt. In\ncase of an interface paradigm change,\nit\u2019s probably true, more often than not,\nthat after a short period of lower productivity whilst getting used to the new\nUI, it will become second nature. We\nare also prepared to deal with rough\nedges in the latest software and we\ngrow acclimatised to their quirks and\noddities.\nThe general user is not like this. And\nthis is why Windows 8 is probably going to cause us, the more \u201ctechy\u201d folks,\nmore grief than it\u2019s worth when it\u2019s released today.\nWindows 8 comes with a whole new\nset of user interface (UI) paradigm and\ndesign known as Modern UI (formerly\nknown as Metro). It is obvious that Microsoft had the touch screen user in\nmind when it was designing the new\nUI: the gestures and the hot corners all\nmake sense when you think of them in\nterms of touch. It takes time to discover\nand get used to the new paradigm. But\nnot everyone like such radical changes,\nespecially if they have a learning curve\nthat a\ufb00ect productivity and remove fa-miliarity.\nSo now that Windows 8 is in the\nwild, you might start to get calls for\nhelp when these users stumble upon\nWindows 8 for the \ufb01rst time. You will\nget pleas to give tutorials on how to\nuse Windows 8. You\u2019re going to get\nswamped with questions asking where\nthey could \ufb01nd a certain feature that\nexisted in a now-removed place. It\u2019s bad\nenough if you are a \ufb01rst time user walking around the terra incognita of Windows 8 and trying to get used to it, it\u2019s\nworse if you have been using Windows\n8 for some time and you still don\u2019t know\nwhere to \ufb01nd something.\nWhile we are, perhaps, willing to\nforgo any misgivings we have about\nMicrosoft for making the changes to\nthe UI once we have adapted to it, users are probably not as willing. In fact,\nthey might be unwilling to change their\nmindset or even try to adapt. Perhaps\nthisisbecausewehaveseenworsewhen\nwe used the beta versions and that what\nis in the \ufb01nal product is actually way\nbetter than it was, though probably still\nunacceptable to the general user.\nI\u2019ll admit: these are hypothetical sce-narios. Whilst I have personally only\nused the consumer preview that was\nreleased months ago, Microsoft has,\napparently, made some improvements\nto the UI since then. But since they\nhave not made any major change to the\nUI paradigm, I am almost certain that\nthese scenarios will happen once people\nget their hands on Windows 8. Technology journalists and some users have\nalready had their share of some of these\nscenarios using the release version of\nWindows 8. Time will tell. Until then,\nI\u2019m o\ufb00 to be the technical support that\nI have always been amongst my friends.\nWill W8 cause us grief?\nW\nYong Wen Chua\nIt\u2019s all about Microsoft\nJason Parmar\nTechnology Editor\nSo why a whole double page\nspread on Microsoft? Just because\nI can? Well, partly that, and the fact\nthat today is being tipped as Microsoft\u2019s biggest day after their boldest\nand most radical move in over three\ndecades.\nAs you probably know from the big\ntitles above, today is the official release date of Windows 8 and it\u2019s the\nbiggest change to the flagship OS in\n17 years, when it released the now\nvintage and retro Windows 95.\nIn those days I just remembered\nMicrosoft as that company that\ngave me the infamous \u201cMicrosoft\nNetwork\u201d, known as MSN, which\nsuccessfully helped me, and probably many of you, waste countless\nhours of life as well as helping create\ncringe e-mail accounts (add me btw:\nstupidly_sexy_jason_1991_xxxo@\nhotmail.com).\nBut besides giving us MSN, Microsoft gave us the Office Suite, the\nforerunner in productivity applica-tions, the Xbox 360, the fourth best\nselling games console of all time and\nof course Windows, the most used\nOperating System in the world (with\na huge 90% market share just 5\nyears ago).\nBut they haven\u2019t been on their\ngreatest form as of late. They\u2019re seeing themselves struggling against\nthe much nimbler Google and Apple.\nSo they\u2019ve been hard at work, trying\nto completely reinvent themselves,\nor at least the public opinion of them.\nWindows 8 is the Redmond giants\nmake or break to grab back market\nshare and prove to the world that we\nneed Microsoft.\nThis week two of our writers who\nhave had a play around with Windows 8 are here to give you their insight to the OS and we also let you\nknow the difference between the\nthree iterations: Windows 8, Windows 8 RT and Windows 8 Pro.\nI\u2019m going to start a white background hiring service. I\u2019ll make millions.\n15\n\n"

The hall was\npacked with students all trying to \ufb01nd\nsome sort of window to look out of.\nThere seemed to be many di\ufb00erent op-tions, all o\ufb00ering di\ufb00erent views, and\ndi\ufb00erent quality views. Felix managed\nto perch inside the Union Building itself and take photos from the window\nof as many people as they could. Snaps\nranging from Dame Judi Dench to JLS\nbeing told to go round the side rather\nthan the front entrance were obtained,\nwith a varying degree of success and\nblurriness.\nHowever some students went even\nfurther in their e\ufb00orts to get a peek at\nthe red carpet and managed to climb\nup onto the roof of Beit Hall.\nAccording to students that were on\nthe roof, who wish to remain anony-mous, there was a \ufb01re door that led\nout onto the rooftop that was not\nguarded by security on the night.\nThe door was on the Beit fourth \ufb02oor\nby the east. It said that the door was\nalarmed, but it was, in fact, not. This\ndoor was able to be opened, and students went on to the roof from there.\nThen, from the outside, there is a door\ninto the Union, which could not be\nopened from inside but can be opened\nfrom the outside.\nConcerns were raised about the student\u2019s actions as the rooftop of Beit is\nconsidered dangerous due to it being\na sheer drop, and it is unsafe for students to be there and so close to the\nedge.\nThe students added, \u201cI was surprised\nhow easy it was to get on the roof. It\nprobably should be more secure but\nnot too secure. When we went to\nsecurity, no-one was there Security\nwas very low\u201d. The student added that\n\u201cGreat view! We should come up here\nmore often. Can\u2019t wait for the next\nRAH Premier\u201d.\nBeit Security were unable to comment on the student\u2019s presence on the\nrooftop. Felix could not get a quote in\ntime about the incident, but is hoping\nto follow up later and, at the very least,\nhave something online.\nOnce the audience had all gone into\nthe Royal Albert Hall, the crowds\nquickly dissipated and the mission\n(no pun intended) to remove all of\nthe structures that were created could\nget underway. By 2am on Wednesday\n24 October, all of the structures that\nwere put up were removed and the last\ntruck was leaving.\nAdditional reporting by Tim Arbabzadah\ncontinued from the front page\n>>\n\n"

With empty\nballs I\u2019d be able to stay grounded\nand see her for what she really is.\nWe arrived at the restaurant \u2013\nsub-par Japanese far served by an\nirritating man in a funny hat \u2013 and,\nof course, I ended up seated next to\nHarry. At the \u201cmeet \u2018n\u2019 greet\u201d before joining, when graduates were\ndescribing the cost of rent in London, Harry ones squawked \u201c\u00a3550 a\nWEEK?\u201d No, fucktard, not week,\nyear: why don\u2019t you engage your\nfucking brain and think about it\nfor a second. Apparently Marketing is one of the few programmes\none can enter with a 2.2. Throughout the meal I take full advantage\nof the credit cards, qua\ufb03ng Cristal and disappearing to do more\nlines, anything to avoid conversa-tion. Harry won\u2019t shut up about\nhow useless he is with chopsticks\nand something about how raw \ufb01sh\ngives him the \u201cjitters\u201d.\nWhen we eventually make it to\nthe club I have to say I\u2019m a little\ndisappointed. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t\nlike Amikahikibargovidawhites \u2013\nit\u2019s just I can\u2019t fucking stand those\nplaces. Overly dolled-up women\nwho will squat on anything for a\ncheeky line and a glossy handbag,\nthe utterly repugnant toad-of-a-man and his parade of oligarchs\nstood in the corner, and a dreadful soundtrack that I\u2019d trade in for\nsome sounds of JLS any night of\nthe week. But I was\nthere, with nothing\nbut my charming colleagues and enough\ncigarettes and blow\nto see me through a\ncouple of hours.\nDuring one of\nmy many outings\nto the smoking area\nI stumbled across a\ncute blonde called\nLiz. She assured me\nthat this wasn\u2019t usually her scene, and that actually\nshe couldn\u2019t stand the people. This\nwould have been more believable\nhad she not been so \ufb01dgety, constantly hinting at a need for drugs.\nWe disappear to the restroom\nand reappear minutes later \ufb01lled\nwith glee, and sit down at my colleagues\u2019 table to plan the rest of\nour evening. It\u2019s at this point Sheila, my manager, tumbles over, horrible meaty \ufb02esh sticking out from\nall edges, and a crusted patch of\nteriyaki sauce glued to her face.\nPushing 40 and still hopping into\nbed alone, she thinks that interrupting my interesting conversation and grabbing at my cock will\nimprove her life prospects. Instead, the combination of the teriyaki patch, her rancid Marlborostained tongue, and the general\nhorror of the situation all begin\nto crescendo, as I feel hot, acidic\nliquid climbing my oesophagus.\nAt this point I knew I had to make\na decision: cute blonde for one\nnight only, or a job to keep a roof\nover my head for the next year. I\nturned to Liz and projected my\nsick in her general direction. It\nsloshed all over her neck, and\nshe sat there looking stunned.\nCall me Mr Squander. As a consolation prize I give her what\u2019s\nleft of my powder, and order a\ncab home. I\u2019m thinking next week,\nand for the rest of the year, I\u2019ll give\nthe drinks a miss. I\u2019d rather just\nsit in and have a Pot Noodle and\na wank.\nFRIDAY 26 OCTOBER\n42\nMickey Luff\u2019s afternoon drinks\nMissing man foolishly ventured off IKEA path\nA police investigation into the disappearance of William Claydon, 34, has\nrevealed that he vanished after venturing o\ufb00 the designated IKEA pathway\nin the Croyden branch of the Swedish\nconglomerate. Claydon, who last seen\nbrowsing a modern yet a\ufb00ordable sofa,\nwandered o\ufb00 to look at exhibit kitchen\nand was never heard from again. A police spokesman reiterated the dangers\nof a trip IKEA, \u201cIf you absolutely must\n\ufb01nd household goods at low prices\nthen we implore you to stick to the\nmarked out trail that is there for your\nown safety\u201d before adding \u201cmost people don\u2019t read Swedish, but if they did,\nthey\u2019d know that all those signs with\nwords such as \u2018Lyksele\u2019\n, \u2018Dvala\u2019 and\n\u2018Standig\u201d are not imaginative and fun\nSwedish names for otherwise dreary\nhousehold items, but signs warning of\ndangerous Norse mythical creatures\u201d.\nThe police went on to state that they\nwould be releasing pamphlets detailing\nthe importance of staying on the set\ntrack as well as a list of old Norse gods\nthey could pray to or make a pact with\nin exchange for keeping them safe from\nthe blood-thirsty and vicious creatures\nhidden within the latest range of ward-robes. Ikea released a statement saying\nthat whilst they were trying to tackle\nthe problem by issuing maps upon entrance and regular warning announcements inside, they were unlikely to ever\nfully rid themselves of the problem as\nthey had made a pact with Loki which\nlet him do what he wanted so long as\nthe company continued to have highpro\ufb01le, international success.\nHangman\u2019s Finest College News Source\nthe turnip\nFlatpacked picture...\nOBAMARAMATYME2012\nYou won\u2019t be saying that when your\nchildren are being touched up by a\nzombie.\nby Hugh Moor\n*\n*May contain exaggeration for comic effect\n\n"

Railways are being\ndeposited left, right and centre; the\nIndustrial Revolution is in full swing;\nand next year, Darwin will publish his\ninfamous \u2018Origin of Species\u2019. It is no\nsurprise, then, that today, in the 21st\ncentury, we always look back on this\nperiod as a time of incredible technical progress and profound leaps in our\nscienti\ufb01c understanding. It is against\nthis fascinating backdrop that three\nmen came together and founded the\nPre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, British\nart\u2019s answer to the complete upheaval\nof 19th century society. Together, John\nEverett Milais, Dante Gabriel Rossetti\nand William Holman Hun sought to\nrebel against the \u2018slavery\u2019 of the modern factory. They wanted to reject the\nidea that Raphael, the great Italian\nmaster, represented the pinnacle of\naesthetic achievement. Instead, they\ndecided to draw their inspiration from\nthe freshness of early Renaissance art:\nthe bright colours, \ufb02at surfaces and\ntruth to nature.\nIn a highly ambitious project, Tate\nBritain has succeeded in bringing together a vast quantity of Pre-Raphaelite works together to an exhibition\nthat is at once comprehensive and\nconducive to understanding the development of the Brotherhood, but also\nvaried and diverse.\nAs a person who has recently become disillusioned with art exhibitions due to the de\ufb01nitely-not-student\nprices extracted merel y to see a handful of paintings (*cough* Titian at the\nNational Gallery), I was impressed\nby the scale of this exhibition which\nspanned 7 rooms and not only gave\nme plenty to ponder about, but was\nalso a feast to the eyes (I do not tend\nto use that term lightly).\nThe exhibition is arranged chrono-logically, and the \ufb01rst room is dedicated to the earliest paintings of the\nBrotherhood. Not, in all honesty, being a very big fan of early Renaissance\nart myself, I felt my heart sinking as I\nread the blurb just before entering the\ngallery. But I was to be pleasantly sur-prised. Yes, the Pre-Raphaelites have\ngone out of their way to incorporate\ncharacteristics of earlier art: the non-idealised faces, the sharp outlines and\nthe medieval subjects; but the result is not overbearing. The pictures\nare still unquestionably modern and\nrather than simple imitations of Italian art. The exhibition is a fusion of\ncontemporary aesthetic realism with\nthe exuberance of medieval art. It is\nunfamiliar and slightly unnerving, but\nexciting too.\nHowever it is the later rooms that\nare the most absorbing and there is\na distinct transition from the initial\nstrict loyalty of the movement to early\nItalian art, to a much more relaxed\nfascination with colour and playing\naround with the female form.\nNature remains a muse in the PreRaphaelites\u2019 work throughout the\nperiod of their activity, with a novel\ninterest in precise composition and\ncropping of the visual \ufb01eld, both arguably brought about by the recent\ndevelopment of photography. Equally\ninteresting is how Pre-Raphaelitism\ngives way to the Aesthetic movement,\nhow the focus shifts from \u2018truth\u2019 to\n\u2018beauty\u2019.\nNot an institution to leave a single\nstone unturned, the Tate went as far\nas \ufb01lling one of the rooms with non-painting works, with material including tapestries and stained-glass win-dows, showing just how versatile the\nBrotherhood were with their media.\nI would highly recommend this\nexhibition for an introduction to an\nextraordinary art movement drawn\nfrom the mind of a truly unique group\nof radical individuals.\nMargot Pikovsky\nBromance of the\nrenaissance men\nTate Britian honours Pre-Raphaelite rebels\nWhy work?

This is a 20%\nturnout as claimed by the Union.\nThe Union said in the article on their\nwebsite announcing it that they were\n\u201creally proud of... election turnouts\u201d.\nIt then went on to say that \u201cImperial\nCollege Union is improved, by all the\ngreat student O\ufb03cers that get elected,\nevery time you vote.\u201d\nIn these elections, every single year\nrep for every subject was elected. As\nwell as this, all of the undergraduate\nand postgraduate Council Ordinary\nMembers for the Faculty of Engineering, Medicine, and Science were elect-ed. The Disabilities O\ufb03cer was also\nelected. As with all elections, there is\na possibility to Re-Open Nominations\n(RON) if none of the candidates take\nthe voter\u2019s fancy.\nFor the position of Disabilities Of\ufb01cer, Moeko Maiguma-Wilson was\nelected, unopposed, with 1147 votes\nto RON (not from Harry Potter) gaining 218.\nThe number of votes cast was generally higher for the undergraduate\nCouncil Ordinary Members when\ncompared to the other positions\nalso being elected. The postgraduate\nCouncil positions also had a considerably smaller turnout when compared\nto the undergraduate elections. The\nmost extreme example (where both\npositions are elected) is the Faculty\nof Science. In the undergraduate elec-tion, the top three candidates, Jason\nParmar, Mariza de Souza, and Stuart\nHaylock, who were all elected, received 162, 139, and 60 votes respectively in the \ufb01rst round. However, in\nthe postgraduate election the two positions were \ufb01lled by James Bannock\nand Xiaoran Lai who had 30 and 13\nvotes in the \ufb01rst round respectively.\nThe overall turnout was high, how-ever, in many individual position\u2019s\nelections, the turnout was still fairly\nlow as a raw number, with many\nelected after receiving no more than\n20 votes.\nSome positions do still remain\nun\ufb01lled. The Faculty of Medicine\u2019s\nCouncil Ordinary Member is still un\ufb01lled, with one person needed for the\nrole.\nThere are a few rep positions that\nare still empty. These are generally for\nthe more niche subject\u2019s rep position.\nThese are all for MSc subject\u2019s course\nreps and are: Advanced Materials Science and Engineering Course Rep,\nHuman Molecular Genetics Course\nRep, Optics & Photonics Course\nRep, Controlled Quantum Dynamics Course Rep, Plastic Electronics\nCourse Rep, Epidemiology & Master\nof Public Health Social Rep, and MBA\nCourse Rep. All of these positions had\nnobody standing for them the \ufb01rst\ntime around, and therefore RON won.\nThe full results can be seen on the Union\u2019s website here: https://www.impe-rialcollegeunion.org/news/your-reps-council-elections-results\nTim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief\n\n"

    "content": "FASHION\nFashion Editors: Alex Ramadan,\nSaskia Verhagen, Alice Yang\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 26 OCTOBER\n12\nAlice Yang enters the magical world of fashion photography\nhere has long existed a\ndebate in regards to the\nreasons behind fashion\nphotography. Do photographers pick up their Hasselblads solely under the direction of\nDevil Wears Prada-esque editors, and\ndo models pose nonchalantly just to\nput the seemingly un-wearable catwalk designs to use? Or perhaps it is\njust to do with amusement, allowing\nsome to turn a hobby into a career.\nJusti\ufb01cations for the art, if you will\nallow me to refer to it as such, stretches back to the days of the invention of\nthe camera. In fact, fashion photography is a medium which everyone,\nwhether consciously or not, appreci-ates. From Burberry\u2019s latest campaign\nfeaturing the adorable Roo Panes to\nthe well-loved Dior Cherie advert in\nwhich an innocent Natalie Portman\nposes in her most natural form \u2013 any\nadvert one comes across related to\nthe fashion world counts as fashion\nphotography. And just like celebrated\nartists and musicians, there are famous fashion photographers known\nfor their skills and expertise, or in Tim\nWalker\u2019s case, their ability to create\nanother world.\nTim Walker\u2019s photography is the\ntype that leaves one speechless, perhaps the natural result of having been\nthrown into a fairy tale, except that\nat his latest exhibition, one awakes\nfrom the dream to discover a real-ity. Somerset House\u2019s East Wing has\nbeen morphed into a mystical playground of childish tales, in which the\nextravagant props used by the photographer are displayed alongside his\nphotographs. From life-sized spit\ufb01res\nand swan boats to giant dolls and skel-etons, the home of London Fashion\nWeek is showcasing the magician of\nfashion photography itself.\nAccompanied by ethereal jewellery\nbox music and the tapping of visitor\u2019s\nheels against the exhibition\u2019s wooden\n\ufb02oors, Tim Walker whisks you away to\nthe velvet walled room in which you\ntoo can peer out of its windows and\nwitness the staggering beauty commonly drowned out by the grey gloom\nof everyday life. It is a view so full of\nvivid colour and na\u00efve imagination, of\ngiant bees playing cellos and humongous snails lounging on beds that leaving the exhibition inspired is beyond\nchoice.\nAnd for those who crave more, the\nexhibition\u2019s accompanying book Tim\nWalker: Story Teller is the perfect an-tidote. But who need drugs in Walker\u2019s world, where \ufb02ying saucers, race\nhounds and picnic tables \ufb02oat e\ufb00ortlessly in glowing forests? The pages\nof this book present snapshots from\nwithin an incredible mind; pages of\nWalker\u2019s scrap-book and quotes spiralling out of control. Walker endows\nupon us a sugar-coated view of the reality of adulthood in a chaotic mix of\npictures and emotions, with one lesson for us all: \u201cthe lightness of spirit\nallows the imagination to soar cloud\nhigh\u201d.\nT\nTim Walker Story Teller is supported by\nMulberry currently on show at Somerset\nHouse, London.\nAdmission: Free.\n18/10/2012 - 27/01/2013\nTim Walker Story Teller published by Thames & Hudson is now available\nfor \u00a345.

King Uther (An-thony Head) is also a character\nthat you love to hate, and adds a\nhuge amount to the show.\nThe new series sees the beginning of the Arthurian legends.\nWe\u2019ve skipped three years since\nthe end of the last series \u2013 Arthur\nis now King, and although Merlin\nis still a young man, the old wizard of old has made an appearance\nas an alter-ego of Merlin, who is a\nknown sorcerer and has got Arthur and his Knights out of a fair\nfew scrapes. The Knights and Merlin are in the wild searching for\nLady Morgana (Katie McGrath),\nwhile Guinevere (Gwen) is back at\nCamelot ruling in Arthur\u2019s place.\nPlot development seems pretty\nrapid at this stage, and there are\nsome new beasts and creatures\nthat are fairly amusing. The last\nepisode I watched had some big\n\u2018sperm\u2019 creature in it \u2013 kind of a\ncross between a ghost, a cone-head and something out of Dr\nWho. A new dragon has made\nan appearance and Arthur is still\nblissfully unaware of Merlin\u2019s\nmagic, despite having been saved\na number of times already.\nThere\u2019s some confusion over the\nplot \u2013 an old druid has given Merlin some clues as to who is going\nto be the Big Bad in this series, but\nthis character appears to be Arthur\u2019s saviour, while some of the\nbest-loved characters start to have\nshady, nastier aspects to their per-sonality. The \ufb01rst episode seemed\nto be a cross between Lord of the\nRings, Game of Thrones and Harry Potter, and we were constantly\nmaking comparisons to other se-ries.\nHowever, despite all of this, there\nis something that draws me to the\nseries. The dynamic between Merlin and Arthur is hilarious. I love\nthe characters because I have been\nwatching from the beginning \u2013 in\nfact, we used to do \u201cMerlin Night\u201d\nparties at each other\u2019s houses during term-time; a good excuse to\nwatch TV and get drunk when\nwe got bored of clubbing. You\nde\ufb01nitely want to watch this with\nfriends. It\u2019s always interesting to\nsee how the series is going to progress \u2013whether in a positive or\nnegative direction, it\u2019s de\ufb01nitely\nan entertaining thing to watch.\nT\nOne hundred episodes in and Kevin\nappears to be going soft.

    "content": "Yawning at Field Music\nMUSIC\nAntics: in retrospect\nThere aren\u2019t many rock albums in the\npast decade which have been as darkly\nunique and memorable as Antics, the\nsecond release from New York based\nfoursome Interpol. When Interpol\nare discussed nowadays, it is more in\nthe context of what could have been,\nas their third and fourth releases \ufb02attered to deceive. However I would\nargue that this is not because they are\nactually poor records, but rather testament to the quality of Antics and 2002\ndebut Turn On The Bright Lights which\nset the bar so high that it was always\ngoing to be di\ufb03cult to reach those\nsame heights. And so it proved after\nthe disappointment of their self-titled\nfourth album, as the band have been\non hiatus since 2011 \u201cto pursue separate projects\u201d, according to drummer\nSam Fogarino.\nAntics opens as it means to\ngo on with the typically melancholic\n\u2018Next Exit\u2019, on which lead singer Paul\nBanks croons \u201cwe\u2019re gonna trek this\nshit around...we ain\u2019t going to the\ntown, we\u2019re going to the city,\u201d perhaps\na re\ufb02ection on the band themselves\nas they try to \u2018make it big\u2019. \u2018Evil\u2019, the\nsecond single from the record and\nan undisputed masterpiece of a song,\nis rumoured to be about serial killer\nRosemary West, who was convicted of\n10 murders in 1995. This understandably fails to lift the gloom and doom\nsurrounding the album, even through\nthe slightly more uplifting \u2018Take You\nOn A Cruise\u2019, which is carried along by\nCarlos Dengler\u2019s thunderous bassline.\nThe star of the album though is \u2018Slow\nHands\u2019, a song recently covered by\nAzealia Banks (of all people). The high\ntempo and echoed guitars serve up an\nabsolute treat of a song as Paul Banks\u2019s\nsmooth baritone voice just about manages to make itself heard over the din.\nThis is followed up by the more bombastic \u2018Not Even Jail\u2019 which builds itself up to a frenzied chorus and the\nbrilliantly named \u2018Public Pervert\u2019 in\nwhich the concluding breakdown really is something to savour. \u2018C\u2019mere\u2019,\nthe third single from the album, could\npossibly be described as the most upbeat song out of all of them (although\nthis isn\u2019t saying much) as Paul Banks\nabandons his Ian Curtis-like vocals for\nsomething more romantic. After all\nthis is a song about unrequited love;\n\u201cThe trouble is that you\u2019re in love with\nsomeone else.\u201d Antics has an underlying nautical theme shown by \u2018Take You\nOn A Cruise\u2019 and the lyrics of the \ufb01nal song \u2018A Time To Be So Small\u2019, on\nwhich guitarist Daniel Kessler exhibits\nall of his talents to bring the album to\nan epic conclusion, as his guitar chops\nand chimes in typical Interpol fashion.\nAntics featured on many reviewers\u2019\nlist of the top 50 albums of 2004 but\nhas always slightly stood in the shadow of its more illustrious predecessor\nTurn On The Bright Lights. It is a well\nknown fact that the second album is\noften the most di\ufb03cult for bands such\nas Interpol, and in my opinion they did\na \ufb01ne job of it. With the albums that\nfollowed however, it seems that Interpol became a victim of their own suc-cess.\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter,\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Martinez de Rituerto\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\n37\nFRIDAY 26 OCTOBER\nAMS album of the week\nIt\u2019s been a long two years for Egyptian Hip Hop,\nand after jumping off the hype machine they were\nso reluctantly thrust upon, they have returned with\na debut album full of new material that takes a dif-ferent, perhaps more accomplished direction than\ntheir earlier releases.\nThe infectious pop hooks and bass lines which\nfeatured on the singles \u2018Moon Crooner\u2019 and \u2018Rad\nPitt\u2019 still remain but this time around, they are immersed in a struggle between tribal rhythms and\nCure-esque meandering guitars. The album wears its world music influences on\nits sleeve, with the sheer diversity of the sounds and instruments used revealing\nitself after each listen. Despite this, contrary to previous releases, each track on\nGOOD DONT SLEEP feels like it belongs with the others.\nBeginning the album with a kick, \u2018Tobago\u2019 is heavily layered with all sorts of\nnicefiddlyguitarsoundsandominouschant-singing.Nextupis\u2018TheWhiteFalls\u2019,\nwhich upon listening to, one could easily expect an ambient interlude, but instead it bursts into arguably the most anthemic of all tracks on GOOD DONT\nSLEEP. The latest single \u2018Yoro Diallo\u2019 features some of the less reverberated vo-calsofthealbum,withawonderfulmurmur-alongchorusandawonkypopmen-tality. \u2018Snake Lane West\u2019 is a slow, progressive nod to the guitar stylings of Adrian\nBelew,while\u2018PearlSound\u2019isapsychedeliceuphony.Nextonthetracklistingand\nthe first single taken from the album is the surprisingly dancefloor-ready \u2018SYH\u2019\nwhich starts as a jangly affair and ends with a great IDM-come-Talking Heads\nbreakdown (sounds odd, but I feel I\u2019m pretty accurate on this one). Another\nhighlight is \u2018One Eyed King\u2019, a slow, muggy monster of a jam, leaving the glittering vocal harmonies of \u2018Iltoise\u2019 to end the album on a soothing note.\nOnecan\u2019thelpbutgetthefeelingEgyptianHipHophavemadethealbumthey\nalways wanted to, shedding the role of bloggers\u2019 golden boys to pioneers of a\ndeeper, progressive evolution of experimental pop.\nEgyptian Hip Hop: GoodDon\u2019tSleep\nIt is an a\ufb04iction of the internet age\nthat, nowadays, a band must be\ntragically cool to get noticed. They\nmust have the right haircuts, a certain amount of buzz about them and\nnormally a postcode from Dalston,\nShoreditch or at the moment South\nLondon. Field Music, however, are\nthe antithesis of this; they are desperately uncool and do not profess to ride\non any trends or jump on any band-wagons. They have stuck to their indie\nethos from the start, forming in 2004.\nThey have gradually garnered critical\nacclaim with their four albums, and\nhave attracted a sizeable, if not slightly\ncultish, following. So I attended their\nLondon show at the Electric Ballroom\nin Camden with the anticipation that\nthis was what music was meant to be\nabout.\nMusic should not, I thought to my-self, be about the importance of the\nhype machine, the coolness of the\nlead singers new mop haircut or how\nmany synthesisers the band employ.\nIt should be about the music\u2026 how\nwrong I was. Field Music, although\nbeing great musicians, basically play a\nmixture of indie and white boy funk\nwith prog tendencies to a middle-aged crowd all doing embarrassing\ndad dances. (If you have been to a\nwedding lately you know what dance\nI am talking about.) When I looked\naround the busy venue it struck me\nthat the average age was about forty,\nrather than the youthful crowds I am\nso used to. There is, however, nothing\ninherently terrible about attracting a\ncrowd of middle aged couples. I am\nsure that these were some really cool\nforty year olds; the ones who have\ntaken a fair share of pills in their time,\nthe ones who plan family vacations\naround Glastonbury, the ones who\nare so \u2018chill\u2019 that they let their children\nchoose their own names when they\nare old enough. BUT, it does not make\ntheir booty-popping any less cringe-worthy or embarrassing.\nThere were de\ufb01nitely some songs\nwhich shone to me, such as \u2018Them that\ndo nothing\u2019 and \u2018Who\u2019ll pay the bills\u2019.\nThe majority of the material was taken\nfrom their most recent album Plumb\nwhich has attracted the notable glances of a Mercury nomination, and these\nsongs on the whole were the strongest\nof the night. The ambling nature of the\nset, however, did nothing to keep me\nenraptured. Songs morphed into one\nanother, held together with prog guitar noodlings, which meant that my\nattention was not held for a signi\ufb01cant\nperiod all night. There is no doubting\nthat Field Music have some fantastic\nmelodies but just as one builds up, just\nas in \u2018A new town\u2019, it is quickly dismantled in favour of a further instrumental\nsection which was de\ufb01nitely a shame.\nThere was also an interesting dynamic\nbetween the two Brewis brothers but\nit seemed to me that the lads from up\nin the North East were actually \ufb01ghting a losing battle to keep their middle\naged movers and shakers \ufb01rmly under\ntheir spell. There were moments when\nthe tall man in front of me didn\u2019t know\nwhether to sway to the beauty of some\nof the more fragile sections, as in the\nbeginning of \u2018Start the day right\u2019, or to\nhave a white boy funk freakout session\nas he did one minute later in the same\nsong. To say the poor bloke was both\nconfused and exhausted by the end\nwas an understatement.\nWhat struck me most about Field\nMusic was that they de\ufb01nitely had\nsome promising songs and great melodies but they were lost beneath the\nmore experimental and prog parts\nwhich are not so prevalent in their\nalbums. I now realise that most of\nmy friends who really like Field Music are either into jazz or are in white\nboy funk bands and this should have\ncome as a massive warning sign to\nme. As I headed back into the night\nI felt slightly dispirited; let down in\nthe knowledge that sometimes music\nneeds the haircuts, the hipsters and\nthe bloggers because without them I\nended up at a gig with some dancing\ndads listening to some jazz ramblings\nof an indie band I once thought were\nquite good. I am sorry Field Music,\nbut as a live proposition, I do not get\nyou. Come back to me in twenty years\ntime when my biggest hobby will be\ngardening and my happy marriage\nwill be interspersed with an a\ufb00air with\nSheila from next door and I am sure\nI will happily bust out some terrible\ndance moves in Camden, but for now-no thank you.\nYasmin Malik\nMark England Music Editor\nAlex Hooftman Writer\nLooking back at Interpol\u2019s sophomore album\nIs it over yet?\n\n"

The slogan on a lot of the commemorative t-shirts was \u2018celebrating 10\nyears of adventurous music.\u2019 My experiences ranged from the obscure to the\nexperimental to the just plain weird, so\nthe slogan seems apt enough.\nOn Friday night I arrived to be\ngreeted by the minimalist electronica\nof Modi\ufb01ed Toy Orchestra. I had listened to their album and largely formed\nthe opinion that their idea of exclusively using children\u2019s toys to make their\nmusic with techniques such as circuit\nbending was interesting but their music\nwas ultimately unimpressive. I have to\nsay though, they surprised me. First of\nall, because I wasn\u2019t expecting \ufb01ve serious looking guys in all black suits, but\nmore than that because it had a much\nmore sinister aspect live and frankly, a\ntoy gun being used to make a beat, the\naudience being addressed by a partly\ndismantled doll\u2019s head and another doll\nwith three contact mics stuck into its\nhead simply make for a good spectacle.\nHey Collosus I expected more from,\nbut sound problems paved the way for\nan underwhelming performance. Occasionally, they got into their groove,\ndropping sludgy ri\ufb00s almost on demand and experimenting lightly with\ndrones and motorik rhythms. These\nlast two elements, however, were presented to me as a key feature of their\nwork and I was disappointed that they\ndidn\u2019t delve more deeply into the experimental areas of their music.\nNext up was JK Flesh. He provided\nwhat I expected \u2013 Justin Broadrick with\na Macbook and a guitar, screaming and\nplaying ri\ufb00s over drum & bass beats\nwhile dystopian black and white images\nwere presented in the background. It\nwas ok, and I appreciated seeing Broadrick perform, but I felt it was lacking as\na live spectacle.\nOn Saturday, the shows began in the\nlate afternoon and I was treated to one\nof the best performances of the week-end. Stian Westerhus, from Rune\nGrammofon band Puma, presented\nan impressive solo performance. It\nconsisted of him, his guitar and about\nten pedals. He proceeded to produce\nsome intense noise. Like Puma, and\nindeed his solo work, there was a de\ufb01nite sense, for me at least, that he was\nextracting and presenting the euphoric\nside of noise. In fact, the emotive nature\nof the 30-minute piece really struck me,\nas he seemed to barely notice the audience and was visibly carried away by\nhis performance. He then cut it down,\nwith some ambient bowing and built it\nright back up again, at one point even\nscreaming into his pickups to produce\nfeedback. Another aspect I appreciated\nwas his deep understanding of his intricate set-up and his intuitive relationship with it.\nAfter this I drifted for a while, watching Sir Richard Bishop doing some\nimpressive guitar noodling and Kevin\nDrumm dropping some noisy drone. I\ndon\u2019t feel that I have the right to comment though because I only saw parts\nof these sets. Dylan Carlson disappointed me. I just have to say that.\nWhat I saw of his set was him doing\nsome Earth-style guitar over a backing\ntrack before being joined by a disappointing singer and drummer. While an\nalbum of the guitar over backing track\nwould be good, it really didn\u2019t work for\nme live.\nFlower-Corsano Duo produced another amazing show. It would be remiss\nof me not to mention Chris Corsano\u2019s\nincredible drumming ability, with precise dynamics and timing, playing at\nbreakneck speed seemingly without\nbreaking a sweat. Mick Flower\u2019s Japanese banjo (it sounded like a sitar) gave\nthe performance an almost spiritual\nfeel. The drumming helped alter the\nfeeling of meditation to one of catharsis\nas he built up the piece. At the peak of\nthe music a visualisation talking about\nthe choice between fear and love added\nto the atmosphere these two virtuosos\nproduced and left me simply wanting to\nre\ufb02ect on what I\u2019d seen.\nEnter Bohren & der Club of Gore.\nSlow, relaxing jazz. They performed\nin the dark with a small spotlight over\neach of them. The 40 minutes of their\nset didn\u2019t leave me with much to say but\nthat\u2019s not a bad thing at all. It served as\na fantastic chill out, appreciated by everyone watching.\nThis chill out soon ended uncer-emoniously, with the crowd already\npumped at the prospect of Merzbow,\nand many, like myself, staying where\nthey were to get the best possible spot.\nThe festival threw a few curveballs\nand Merzbow\u2019s set was one of the big-gest. Many were expecting a laptop\nset, as this seems to be a direction he\nhas taken for a long time now. It tran-spired, however, that we were in for a\nsurprise and a treat. He performed the\nentire set with a drummer and one of\nthe tracks featured a guitarist. The\nother of the two tracks featured a brief\ncameo by Eugene Robinson of Oxbow\n(mainly shouting). Throughout, Merzbow played what I can only describe as\na \u2018noise banjo\u2019; it resembled a banjo, but\nhad thick metal coils in place of strings\nand a solid metal body. This was then\nconnected into his rig and violently\nstrummed to produce a much more\nmetal/grind inspired set than expected,\nharking back to 1994\u2019s Veneorology. He\nalso used a laptop and various noise\nboxes, one of which produced magni\ufb01cent tunnelling noises that seemed to\ntravel through the brain. An immense\nset from a true master of noise, one that\nreally tore me a new one and drove me\nnearly deaf, but delighted.\nAfter that I was feeling a bit overex-cited, but I found the perfect tonic in\nCarlton Melton. Their sounds reminded me of AC/DC and Sleep hot-boxing\na trailer trash caravan in the desert\u2026\non Mars. A blend of space rock, doom,\ndrone and straight-up rock\u2019n\u2019roll, their\nshow was highly enjoyable. Between\nbeatless interludes, there were moments of classic rock showmanship: for\nexample a drum solo, or the guitarist\nentering the crowd and passing his guitar to an audience member. It was pretty simple, but enjoyable nonetheless.\nNext up was Zeni Geva, who seemed\nstrange as the last act of night, but\nmembers KK Null and the drummer\nfrom Ruins served up a good set of\nhardcore/death metal with a pounding aggression I had been missing for a\nwhile.\nSunday started o\ufb00 fairly abrasively\nwith Cli\ufb00ord Torus. The band was\ndescribed as being on the noise side of\nnoise rock. That\u2019s what I expected and\nwhat I got, with half an hour or so of\natonal, noise-laden sludge. A great way\nto start the day in my opinion, and they\nproduced some real headbangers as\nwell as linking up well with each other.\nRuins Alone was basically the drummer from Ruins playing to a backing\ntrack. Good and entertaining, yes, and\nit showcased his ability well, but it just\nmade me want to see Ruins in their full\nglory.\nKK Null performed a solo noise set of\nthe highest quality. While Merzbow\u2019s\nshow was grind/metal based, Null\u2019s was\na lot more electronica oriented, with\nnoise occasionally being dropped over\nbeats. It was not lacking in intensity\nhowever, and ended in Null screaming\ninto a mic, which outputted his scream\nin the form of heavily distorted noise,\nafter which he slammed it down and\nthat was the set. Two guys from doom\nband ORE then took the stage, playing\ntubas, and set up a nice drone, which\nNull then came in and blasted some\nnoise over. This kind of collaboration is\na big part of what made the festival so\nspecial, but I still preferred his solo set.\nLash Frenzy\u2019s Ver Heroicus Sublimis,\na 10th anniversary performance, came\nnext, and provided probably the biggest surprise of the weekend. I did not\nentirely know what to expect, but I\nknew it would be unique and that there\nwould be many guest musicians. After\nsome spoken word on the subject of\nsonic attack, a drone started to form.\nDrone became noise and then an array of musicians in the crowd started to\njoin in. Then a woman walked in wearing next to nothing and circulated the\nroom. At this time, it started to become\nclear that everyone was meant to circu-late, as there were di\ufb00erent pockets of\nsound throughout the room. This was\nfurther implied by some guys carrying\nstrobes around. Thoroughly puzzling\nand intense, it was probably the weirdest thing I\u2019ve ever been to. Afterwards\nI was completely \ufb02abbergasted, and\nthe thought of going to anything else\nseemed somewhat alien.\nThe \ufb01nal act I did go to see was Dope\nBody. They were OK, and brought\nkind of a party atmosphere, but a cheap\npseudo-noise rock thrill perhaps.\nHonourable mention has to go out to\nTim Hecker and Oxbow Orchestra,\nboth of whom I was hoping to see but\ncouldn\u2019t because of train times. Hecker\nin particular is a pleasure to see live, and\nI\u2019m sure he\u2019d have blown me away. On\nthat note, I left the festival with a deep\nsense of appreciation for what I\u2019d seen,\nRhiaz Agahi on Supersonic\u2019s 10th year\nMick plays\nChris some\nsoothing\nmusic to\nhang the\nlaundry by\nStian Westerhus\nserenades a plant\n\n"

    "content": "GAMES\nFRIDAY 26 OCTOBER 29\nGames Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPondering Pandora\nMichael Barclay wants to talk about his love for wub wub\norderlands was, to be\nfrank, a pretty weird\nconcept. Combining a\nfully-\ufb02edged \ufb01rst person shooter with a Diablo-style loot-centric RPG? These\nideas seem pretty hard to gel, when\n\ufb01rst thought about, but Borderlands\nworked because it just didn\u2019t take itself\nseriously at all. The whole thing was\njust one big joke because it had to be.\nThe ridiculously overpowered guns,\nthe crazy character abilities, even the\nway the game showed you numerically how much damage each shot had\ndone \u2013 these things just wouldn\u2019t have\nworked in your bog-standard shooter.\nBut with its cartoon-style graphics,\nover the top gore and ridiculous cast\nof characters, the whole thing worked,\nand all-in-all, Borderlands was a pretty\ngood game.\nHowever, at the time, I had my issues\nwith it. Once you got past the humour\nand the outlandishness of the whole\nthing, the world of Pandora, where\nthe whole game is set, was pretty life-less. Missions were handed out to you\nby noticeboards or over an intercom\nferrying you from point A, to point\nB, to kill bandits C, before you return\nback to point A to collect a reward\nand accept another very similar mis-sion. It also didn\u2019t help that this game\nwas released at a time where barren\npost-apocalyptic wastelands were two\na penny and Pandora just felt like another identi-kit empty desert. To top it\nall o\ufb00, the story itself was poor with no\nreal direction and a famously terrible\nending. All-in-all, this quickly made\nthe game feel grindy and repetitive as\nyou performed missions just to perform missions and inch your character\ncloser to that next level up.\nBorderlands 2 is pretty much more\nof that same game. Cartoony, violent, a\nstupid amount of guns. It\u2019s another sequel of the many sequels released these\ndays. However, unlike Call of Duty and\nAssassin\u2019s Creed\u2019s almost iterative attitude to game design, where annual\nreleases are not only common but ex-pected, Gearbox has spent 3 years perfecting the Borderlands format. Borderlands 2 is better in absolutely every\nsingle way, transforming the franchise\nfrom good, to absolutely fantastic. The\nAI has been drastically improved \u2013\nnow enemies jump out of your line of\n\ufb01re and use cover far more often than\nbefore. The classes feel familiar enough\nfor those who played the original, but\nwith enough modi\ufb01cations to make it\nall feel fresh. There also seems to be a\nlot more emphasis on balance between\nthe various classes, especially at the\nendgame with stupidly strong enemies\nthat require a well-equipped and intelligent group of four players to kill. It\u2019s\noften hard to spot graphical improvements with games that adopt a car-toony style, but with Borderlands 2 it\u2019s\nnoticeable. If you\u2019re playing on PC and\nhave a relatively modern NVIDIA card,\nthere are some fantastic physics on\nshow. The water e\ufb00ects are astounding\nand fabric tears apart beautifully as it is\nshot to pieces.\nBest of all though, Pandora now feels\nalive and exciting. A large hub city introduced very early on gives the player\na sense of home and a base full of NPCs\nthat provide the majority of your mis-sions. The boring drab deserts are now\nreplaced with a variety of landscapes,\nincluding lush highlands, tundra and\nlarge metropolises.\nThe game also sports a much better\nstory. Something as simple as giving\nthe game a proper villain does won-ders. The game\u2019s antagonist, Handsome Jack, completely steals the show\nand provides the majority of the game\u2019s\ncomic relief. Yes, Borderlands 2 is a\nvery, very funny game. Jack is a truly sadistic and warped individual, constantly communicating with the player just\nto piss them o\ufb00. The supporting cast is\nequally entertaining \u2013 my personal favourite being Tiny Tina, a crazed thirteen year old orphan, who spends most\nof the time inviting local bandits to her\nmake-believe tea parties just to blow\nthem up. All in all this leaves you with a\ngame that is just, well\u2026 really fun.\nIn terms of problems, the game\u2019s\nonline component has a few issues.\nThere\u2019s no real loot system in play;\nmoney is divided equally amongst\nplayers as it\u2019s collected, but weapons\ndropped by enemies or found in chests\nare awarded on a \ufb01rst come, \ufb01rst serve\nbasis. Play with a stranger and there\u2019s\na good chance they\u2019ll just hoover up\nevery weapon dropped regardless of\nwhether they intend to use it or not.\nAlso a level scaling system would have\nbeen appreciated. I\u2019ve been playing a\nlot of Guild Wars 2 recently and that\ngame levels you down to the area\u2019s\nlevel cap, meaning you can always go\nand help a friend who has played less\nthan you. Borderlands 2 is de\ufb01nitely a\ngame best played with friends and it\u2019s\na shame when one of your friends out-levels you. Sure, you can still play with\nthem, but they\u2019ll just sweep the \ufb02oor\nwith everything, whilst you do pretty\nmuch nothing.\nThat aside though, Borderlands 2\npretty much marks the beginning of\nthe Autumn/Winter gaming period.\nSure, maybe it\u2019s not innovative, but if\nanything, this game is an example of\nhow to make a sequel. You don\u2019t need\nto throw out everything you know and\nreboot the entire franchise and you\nshouldn\u2019t release a new instalment\nevery year until you get it right. Instead\nGearbox have taken their time to perfect what was already a pretty good\ngame, providing both a great shooter\nand an engaging RPG.\nB\nOH GOD! THE BONERFARTS\n\u2013 THEY\u2019RE EVERYWHERE!\nI left my will to live in\nSan Francisco\no, for those of you who actually read these colour-anemic boxes, last week\nI put up a vote for which simulator game I should play and review. I had\na deluge of emails telling me to try the \u2018social life\u2019 simulator and that I\nshould get out of the Felix office, but the joke\u2019s on them \u2013 I\u2019m dead inside\nanyway. I chose to give the Bus & Cable Car Simulator \u2013 San Francisco a spin, as I\nfelt like seeing the sights and sounds of a hustling and bustling bay city.\nMy desktop computer isn\u2019t new by gaming standards, but it\u2019s not exactly slow\neither, so the 30 minutes it took for the installation screen to even appear was a\nportent of things to come. Installation over, I cranked the graphics settings up to\n11, (and immediately regretted it) making my computer slow to a stuttering ~8fps.\nOnce I was back to a usable frame rate, I then spent 10 minutes trying to get my\npickup truck to go forwards. Windscreen wipers and fans on, with headlights set\nto \u2018retina burning\u2019, I was blazing ahead. And then crashed a few meters ahead. Not\nthe vehicle. The game.\nI solved the crashing problem (don\u2019t drive fast) and made my way to my first objective \u2013 an exhibition hall containing the unlockable vehicles I could look forward\nto. I got myself to the bus depot, chose a route and spent 10 minutes just playing\naround with the onboard computer and the display on the front of the bus. Before\nI even got to the first stop on the route, my bus scraped a lamppost and the sight\nwas akin to that of a beached whale. Verdict: buy if the smell of virtual motor oil\nand disappointment gets you hot.\nNext week\u2019s choices \u2013 Stone Quarry Simulator and Camping Manager. Send\nyour votes or insults into games.felix@ic.ac.uk.\nS\nRoss Webster\nI feel I should start using \u2018Butt\nStallion\u2019 as a term of endearment...\n\n"

Pierce Brosnan\nPossessing the ultimate suave and cheeky charisma, he is the slyest one of them all,\nalthough when it comes to carrying out his missions, he doesn\u2019t go into them half-heartedly. Recent data compiled by The Economist ranks him as the Bond who has done\nthe most killing, which must mean he\u2019s cool... because he\u2019s trigger-happy... with both his\ngun... and his other prized possession. He may be Irish, but clearly he\u2019s got fans down\nhere in the Felix office.\n1. Sean Connery\nSurprised? No? Neither are we. It\u2019s hard to beat originals, and Connery certainly proves\nthat. He\u2019s one of the main reasons the franchise got off to such a remarkable start, giving\nthe MGM Studios a \ufb01rm seal of approval that 007 is a franchise worth sticking with. Six\nactors were chosen and screen tested for the role, and the then 30-year-old Scottish actor\nwon out, after which he was educated in the ways of being \u201cdapper, witty, and above all,\ncool.\u201d And clearly it was time well spent, as he pulls it off flawlessly.\n6. From Russia with\nLove (1963)\nConnery\u2019s famous\n\ufb01ght in the train\ncompartment is hailed\nas being one of the most\nbelievable yet exciting\naction scenes ever\n\ufb01lmed for the screen.\nHis second crack is\nalmost as impressive\nand game-changing as\nhis \ufb01rst, and further\nsolidi\ufb01ed his status.\n5. Live and Let Die\n(1973)\nThe exotic location\nworks as a massive plus\nhere, adding all sorts of\nmystery and intrigue\nto a rather repetitive\nand predictable set of\nideas. The radiant Jane\nSeymour, in one of her\nearly \ufb01lm roles, dazzles\nas the Bond Girl, with\nYaphet Kotto playing\none creepy villain.\n4. You Only Live Twice\n(1967)\nThe scale, for its time\nof release, was as large\nas it was ever going\nto get, and very few\npeople saw the \u201cfake\nvolcano\u201d villain lair\ncoming. The extended\n\ufb01nal ninja assault, is\none extraordinary\nachievement that will\nalways be considered as\na major Bond highlight.\n3. Dr. No (1962)\nHere is what kicked\neverything off to\neventually become\none of the world\u2019s\nmost successful \ufb01lm\nfranchises. Sean\nConnery set the mood\nand style of \ufb01lms to\ncome, and who can\nforget the iconic\nmoment when the\nshell-collecting Ursula\nAndress appears?\n1. Goldfinger (1964)\n\u201cNo, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die!\u201d remains to be the most\nunforgettable line uttered so brilliantly by a Bond villain,\nhandling a rather menacing looking laser, aiming for Bond\u2019s\nfavourite body part. Not only does this have the most\nhysterical double entendre used as its Bond Girl\u2019s name\n(Pussy Galore), the wordless henchman, Oddjob, throwing\naround his deadly bowler hat with a sly grin on his face, is the\nmost popular villain of the series.\n2. Casino Royale (2006)\nNo-one thought Daniel Craig could pull this off, and he faced\na lot of unfair backlash for being the \ufb01rst Bond actor to be\nblonde (really). But opening with the best chase sequence in\n007\u2019s history (and to be honest, most \ufb01lms can\u2019t come close\nto what\u2019s achieved in the \ufb01rst 20 minutes of this), he proved\neveryone wrong with the macho brutality he brought to\nthe role. He also properly falls in love here, something that\ndoesn\u2019t end entirely well.\n\n"

    "content": "TECHNOLOGY Technology Editor: Jason Parmar\ntechology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMICROSOFT SPECIAL\nStephen Ingram tells us his thoughts of Microsoft\u2019s latest OS\nith the next version of Windows, 8, Microsoft are going\nc o m p l e t e l y\noverhaul the interface, with many\npeople wondering whether \u2018the average user\u2019 will be able to adjust to the\nchange (search \u2018Dad tries Windows\n8\u2019 on YouTube for some examples).\nThe main change implemented is\nthat the traditional desktop is now\nmerely an app inside another interface called \u2018Modern UI\u2019 (formerly\nknown as \u201cMetro\u201d, but following a\ntrademark dispute with German\nMetro AG, Microsoft dropped the\nname). It\u2019s the same user interface\nand graphical toolkit currently used\nby Windows Phone 7 (and soon 8)\ndevices. This is an attempt to unify\nthe \u2018face of Windows\u2019 across desk-top, mobile, and tablet.\nHaving tried the Windows 8 release preview on a dusty old tower\nat home, I found that, while it is nowhere near as e\ufb03cient at doing certain tasks as Windows XP or many\nLinux distributions, many of my\nconcerns about using a jack-of-all-trades interface were unfounded.\nProductivity\nAnyone who has attempted to engage in serious o\ufb03ce or design work\non a smartphone or tablet would\nagree that such devices are not designed with this in mind, and it is\noften said that they are purely consumption devices (although the term\nconsumption in the context of software is somewhat erroneous, since\ndigital media are not consumed\nwhen you watch/listen to/play them,\nbut the sentiment is still mostly ac-curate). The main reasons for this\nare the form factor (but using Windows 8 on a desktop renders this ir-relevant, and Microsoft seems to be\nkeen for its tablets to have Bluetooth\nkeyboards) and lack of simultaneous multitasking. The latter problem\nis addressed somewhat as you can\nuse multiple apps at once via a split\nscreen e\ufb00ect, although it seems that\noutside of what\u2019s on the screen all\nother tasks are frozen.\nFile Management\nHowever, another, more integral\nproblem hampers work on mobile\noperating systems: most information you experience is not comparable to a \ufb01le in the desktop OS sense.\nWhile you can get \ufb01le manager apps\nfor mobile devices, the issue is that\nwhen any two apps need to share in-formation, it must be done through\ninteroperability between the apps,\nbuilt from the ground up, rather\nthan simply integrating with the\n\ufb01les saved on the device. This leads\nto either bloated (resource hog)\napps that try to reinvent the wheel,\nor apps that are specialised yet can\nhardly function outside of a small set\nof tasks.\nWindows 8 does not su\ufb00er from\nFRIDAY 26 OCTOBER\n14\nW\nthese problems, as it retains the\ntraditional \ufb01le explorer that can be\nrun in the desktop mode, which all\napplications seem to interface with.\nObviously, we will have to wait and\nsee the extent to which third party\napps keep this up, but it seems unlikely developers would go out of the\nway to give themselves more work in\nthis way.\nAccessibility\nOver the summer I volunteered in a\nlibrary providing tech support, often\nto older people with little experience\nof the motifs of desktop computing.\nOne of their main sources of confu-sion, and I would imagine anyone\nwho has helped technophobes would\nagree, was what, precisely, an application is. The idea of a program that\nis separate from a) the operating system it runs on, b) the window that\ncontains it, and c) the content that\nis produced/relayed through it is an\nextremely di\ufb03cult concept to under-stand.\nIn light of this, I found it odd that so\nmany of us buy smartphones (51%\nof brits now own them), devices\nwhose entire selling point (\u2018there\u2019s\nan app for that!\u2019) seems to be this\nconcept. In my opinion, this is because apps are not applications for\nthe computer in the original sense\nbut another product that owning\nthe device allows you to buy, often\nfrom the device vendor themselves.\nThis is a much easier concept to get\nyour head around and a very simple\nway to monetise a mobile operating system. Some examples of this\ninclude the Kindle Fire and Nexus 7\ntablets, which almost certainly sell at\na loss, but whose pro\ufb01ts are made up\nby subscription services o\ufb00ered by\nGoogle and Amazon.\nThe reason that I mention this is that\nMicrosoft fortunately does not seem\nto be going down this route with\nWindows 8. The model that they are\npushing to sell their own software\nputs more emphasis on useful work\nand not on providing every aspect\nof your life and entertainment, like\nApple or Google. This is fortunate\nbecause such software services tend\nto collect your personal information\nand provide their media under very\nrestrictive Digital Rights Management.\nInterface Consistency\nThis has been written about in some\ndetail on the website osnews.com\nbut I think it is relevant to Windows\n8 and quite prescient considering\nhow just about every OS is altering\nits user experience to become more\n\u2018mobile-like\u2019.\nWhen you\u2019re using an app on a\nsmartphone, the percentage of the\nscreen taken up by the OS is almost\nalways smaller than on a desktop,\nand you hardly ever see more than\none app open on the screen at the\nsame time. As a result, many apps\ncan sacri\ufb01ce \ufb01tting in visually in a\nway that desktop applications cannot (the number of android apps that\ncompletely follow Google\u2019s \u2018Holo\u2019\nguidelines is surprisingly small).\nI can\u2019t talk about how easy the\ngraphical toolkit is to develop for,\nbut, with Windows Phone 7, Microsoft are extremely strict about which\napplications are let into its market-places, and hopefully this will help\nalleviate the issue of visual inconsistency in Windows 8 (and some other\ncauses such as simply porting an iOS\napplication or coding your app in\nHTML).\nConclusion\nI have absolutely no doubt that\nmany people will find Windows 8\nmuch harder to use and to get used\nto using than previous versions. I\nhave every doubt that it will lead\ncomputing in a more efficient and\ninterconnected direction, but to\nmy surprise, many of the practical issues the tech community (and\nmyself) have with using a mobile\ninterface on a non-mobile device\nseem to have been addressed. Essentially, Microsoft has converged\ntwo paradigms in such a way that\nthe end product is inefficient on\neither device and will almost definitely ostracise large portions of its\nuser base. But it\u2019s done it in style.\nA pretty edgy and cool logo for such a traditionally bland company - the only thing more creative would be something like a picture of an apple, with one bite taken out of it and using Myriad font.\n\n"

Roger Moore\nIt\u2019s about quality, not quantity, which is why, even after 7 films, more than any actor has\nso far managed, Moore finds himself on the bottom of our \u201cBest Bond\u201d list. He lacked the\nsuave charisma of Connery, and turned the franchise into a bit of a camp joke. Sure he had\nmore potential when it came to comedy but there is no denying that he has the silliest,\nmost dreadful 007 films under his name. Plus towards the end of his run, he looked so old\nand frail that it was simply embarrassing for him to be saving the world.\n5. George Lazenby\nFamous for being the only Bond who actually managed to tie the knot (although that\ndidn\u2019t last very long), he\u2019s also the only Bond actor to only complete a single feature.\nThe reason?

    "content": "Arthur Charles Clarke\nMaciej Matuszewski talks about one of his favourite authors\nt\u2019s no secret that Arthur C\nClarke is one of my favourite\nauthors of all time. Born in\n1917 he is often considered,\nalongside Isaac Asimov and\nRobert Heinlein, as one of the Big\nThree authors of Golden Age science\n\ufb01ction.\nHe had a brilliant imagination yet\nalways constrained himself to the\nrealms of the scienti\ufb01cally possible.\nHe used his lifelong interest in science\nand technology (he served in World\nWar Two as a radar specialist and later\nobtained a degree in mathematics and\nphysics from King\u2019s College London)\nto paint a vision of the future that even\nnow often remains wonderfully plau-sible. As a result his work is often beloved by scientists and engineers.\nAs with many of his contemporar-ies, his work has often been criticised\nfor its poor characterisation. While\nthis is indeed a problem in some of\nhis novels, most notably in The City\nand the Stars, the fact is that in most\nof his work the focus is not necessarily meant to be the individual characters but rather how humanity adapts\nto new technologies and unforeseen\nsituations that the future may bring.\nThere is a wonderful optimism in\nClarke\u2019s work that, by coming togeth-er, humanity will eventually prevail\n\u2014 whether in the face of disaster, as\nin The Songs of Distant Earth, or simply the unexpected, as in Rendezvous\nwith Rama. This is an outlook somewhat reminiscent of that of Gene Rodenberry, though Clarke did seem to\nbe somewhat less na\u00efve in his views of\nthe future than the Star Trek creator.\nThere are no easy utopias in Clarke\u2019s\nwork \u2014 just an attitude that, though\nwe will make mistakes from time to\ntime, we will probably make it through\nin the end.\nClarke\u2019s writing style is somewhat\nold fashioned and certainly not for\neveryone. It\u2019s not the sort of thing that\nI would want to read every day, but I\ndo believe that it is good writing and\ncan serve as some, for lack of a better\nphrase, \u2018light relief\u2019 from the grittier\nand more con\ufb02ict driven \ufb01ction popular today.\nOne also cannot forget Clarke\u2019s contribution to the popularisation of sci-ence. Not only did his \ufb01ction inspire\ngenerations of scientists and engi-neers, he also wrote numerous non\ufb01ction books and essays exploring the\npossible applications of new technolo-gies. He was the \ufb01rst to suggest using\ngeostationary satellites for communication and popularised Konstantin\nTsiolkovsky\u2019s ideas for a space eleva-tor. Arthur C Clarke died on March 19\n2008 and he will certainly be remembered for many years to come.\nI\nIn the 160 years since its \ufb01rst publi-cation, Moby Dick has become one\nof the most acclaimed novels in the\nEnglish language. However, while\nmost people have heard of the book\nand its most famous characters, few\nhave actually read it. Now, however,\nartist Angela Cockayne and writer\nPhilip Hoare, both big fans of Moby\nDick, seek to correct this problem and\ngive people a chance to experience\nthis masterpiece in a new and exciting way.\nTheir Moby Dick Big Read project,\nwhich started on the September 16\nand runs till the end of January, each\nday releases an audio clip of one of\nthe book\u2019s 135 chapters \u2014 each read\nby a di\ufb00erent, well known individual.\nReaders have already included Tilda\nSwinton, David Cameron and Stephen Fry. They are set to be joined\nin the coming months by the likes of\nBenedict Cumberbatch and Sir David\nAttenborough. Each reading is also\naccompanied by an image, inspired\nby the novel, created by a renowned\nartist.\nThe project\u2019s creators say that they\nwere inspired by the novel\u2019s continuing relevance. They say: \u201cMoby Dick is\nthe great American novel. \u2026 Sprawling, magni\ufb01cent, deliriously digres-sive, it stands over and above all other\nworks of \ufb01ction. \u2026 Now, in the 21st\nCentury, a century and a half since it\nwas \ufb01rst conceived and launched onto\na misbelieving world, Moby-Dick retains its power \u2013 precisely because\nwe are still coming to terms with it,\nand what it said. Incredibly prophet-ic, it foresaw so many of the aspects\nof the modern world which we deal\nwith. The abuse of power and belief;\nof nature and the environment; of the\nhuman spirit. It deals with art and arti\ufb01ce and stark reality \u2013 in an almost\nexistential manner. It is truly a book\nbefore its time \u2013 almost ancient myth,\nas much as futuristic prophesy.\u201d\nAll the chapters that have been released so far may be downloaded for\nfree from mobydickbigread.com.\nHere is the man himself\nMoby Dick Big Read\nMaciej Matuszewski Books Editor\nBOOKS Books Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWe are always looking for\nnew writers!\nEmailusyourbookreviews,\nauthor profiles and other\nbook related features.\nbooks.feilx@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 26 OCTOBER\n34\nRichard Bacon\u2019s Moby Dick artwork for the project\nWANT TO SEE YOUR\nNAME IN PRINT?\n\n"

Daniel Craig\nCraig went through a lot of harsh criticism after his name was announced to take over\nthe franchise. \u201cBoring\u201d was one of the words he was called, and his blonde hair was also\na subject of much scrutiny. Dame Judi Dench (M) came to his defense, giving him her\nseal of approval. Then came November 2006, when Craig proved his critics wrong with\nthe excellent Casino Royale. It was a franchise reboot, injecting a lot more brooding, and\nmuch needed serious energy into a series of films that was getting sillier and sillier.\n4. Timothy Dalton\nProbably the most similar in nature to what the books, and therefore Ian Fleming,\noriginally intended, Dalton was the first to step in to put a fresh new spin on the series\nafter Moore turned it into a farce with his geriatric behaviour towards the end of his run.\nDalton himself only lasted for two films, as we suspect the audience back then wasn\u2019t\nready for such a radical, serious, blood-splattering (his second film is still the highest age-restricted Bond film), which is a shame.\nnbeatable. And as a celebration of your everlasting manhood, we rank the films, and the actors\n14. Die Another Day\n(2002)\nSilly in its plot and\nexecution, Brosnan\u2019s\ngoes to North Korea,\npiling up one ridiculous\nidea after another (an\ninvisible car makes an\nappearance). Halle\nBerry\u2019s savvy Jinx as well\nas Rosamund Pike\u2019s icy\nMiranda Frost are great\nadditions to the cast.\n13. For Your Eyes Only\n(1981)\nWithout a doubt boasts\nthe best theme song,\nbut the film itself is\ndistinctly average,\nalthough the crossbow-wielding Bond Girl\n(Carole Bouquet) who\ndoes something useful\nother than shag the\nwomanising spy is a\nhighlight.\n12. Licence to Kill\n(1989)\nThis was slapped on\nwith the highest ageing\nrestriction for a Bond\nfilm due to its violent\nnature. Timothy Dalton\ncomes off better in his\nsecond/last appearance\nas Bond, and Benicio\nDel Toro\u2019s knife-throwing villain sidekick is badass.\n11. The Spy Who Loved\nMe (1977)\nWill forever be\nremembered as the\nfilm that gave us Jaws,\na hugely entertaining\nvillain of epic size who\ncould have easily ripped\nMoore into tiny little\npieces. Plus Bond meets\nhis match in the deadly\nAnya Amasova, the\ntitular \u201cspy.\u201d\n10. The Man with the\nGolden Gun (1974)\nThe Golden Gun is by\nfar the coolest, most\nmemorable gadget to\ncome out of the Bond\nseries\u2013agunsostylishly\ndisguised as a cigarette\nholder, lighter, and pen,\nall painted in gold. Bond\ngetting owned by a\nvillain one-third his size\nis also a great watch.\n9. Goldeneye (1995)\nPierce Brosnan\u2019s Bond\ndebut got off to a flying\nstart thanks to his\neffortless charm and\nsly humour. This is also\nnotable for having a\nfemale character who\nseems to love rough sex\nmorethanBondhimself:\nthe infamous Xenia\nOnatopp (the hilarious\nFamke Janssen).\n8. Thunderball (1965)\nSet in the crystal clear\nblue waters of the\nBahamas,thisispossibly\nthe best-looking Bond\nfilm out there, both in\ntermsofthemagnificent\nscenery and the many,\nmany women Bond gets\nsurrounded with. This is\nalso famous for its epic\nunderwater fighting\nsequence.\n7. Tomorrow Never\nDies (1997)\nIt\u2019s incredibly rare to\nsee a Bond Girl fend\nfor herself but Chinese\nspy Wai Lin (Michelle\nYeoh) is a highly skilled\nmartial artist.

    "content": "New drug could hold the key\nto pancreatic cancer\nThe thunder god vine, or Lei Gong\nTeng, is a herb used in traditional\nChinese medicine and believed by\nsome to be of use in a variety of ailments from arthritis to kidney dis-ease. The plant contains multiple active compounds, and one of the most\npromising of these is triptolide, previously shown to have potential as a\ndrug for treating various cancers, including pancreatic cancers.\nThe 5-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is only 5%, and in contrast to the advances made in treating other cancers in recent years, this\nrate has not improved signi\ufb01cantly\nover the last 30 years. Attempts to\ndevelop new chemotherapeutic drugs\nhave had little impact, at best adding\nonly a few months or even weeks to\nlife expectancy.\nHowever despite its potent anti-cancer properties, which can be\nreadily demonstrated in the lab,\ntriptolide has proved to be of limited use as a drug. This is primarily\nbecause it does not dissolve well in\nwater, one of the essential \u2018druglike properties\u2019. Research published\nin Science Translational Medicine\nthis month (http://stm.sciencemag.\norg/content/4/156/156ra139.full),\nhowever, presents a way around this\nproblem. Researchers based at the\nUniversity of Minnesota developed\nMinnelide, a modi\ufb01ed synthetic version of triptolide. The modi\ufb01cations\ninhibit the activity of the drug, but\nthey also make it water-soluble. This\nallows Minnelide to be administered\nand absorbed, and once it reaches its\ntarget, enzymes naturally occurring\nin the body\u2019s tissues convert it back\nto its original form, allowing it to get\nto work.\nMinnelide was tested extensively\nhere, both in vitro with cultures of\ncancer cell lines, and in mouse models with xenografted human pancreatic tumours. In all tests it performed\nas well or better than gemcitabine,\nthe current standard of care for\nchemotherapy in pancreatic cancer,\nand in fact worked in some scenarios\nwhere gemcitabine is completely ine\ufb00ective.\nMinnelide is as yet in the early stag-Sarah Byrne Writer\nt is, by now, almost common\nknowledge that changes in\nwater temperatures will affect the biodiversity of marine\nlife. Less research has been invested into the topic of how individuals and populations of surviving species will change in response to such\ndevelopments. A model devised by a\ncollaboration of scientists attempts to\nanswer this question.\nThe size of a \ufb01sh is a\ufb00ected by a great\nrange of factors, but mostly its environment\u2019s water temperature, oxygen\nconcentration, and nutrient availabil-ity. Changing climates will a\ufb00ect the\noxygen concentration in Earth\u2019s water\nbodies (in part due to the fact that\ngaseous oxygen is less soluble in water\nat higher temperatures), which can be\nexpected to have a direct e\ufb00ect on \ufb01sh\npopulations because oxygen is a key\ningredient for body growth.\nThe scientists modelled the e\ufb00ect\nof changing oxygen concentrations\non di\ufb00erent stages of a \ufb01sh\u2019s life cycle\nand the consequent changes in their\npopulations. After testing this model\nby simulating historical changes and\n\ufb01nding a strong correlation (P < 0.01)\nwith observed data, they then extrapolated forwards by a few decades to\npredict what may happen to the global \ufb01sh populations by 2050, should\nclimate trends continue, using a \u201chigh\nirradiation\u201d model.\nThe outcome is worrying; on average between more than 600 modelled\nspecies, the maximum body mass\ncould decrease by 14-24% \u2013 despite\nwater temperatures being predicted\nto increase by less than 0.05\u00b0C per\ndecade. Approximately one half of\nthis e\ufb00ect is due to changes in distribution and abundance (i.e. there are\nfewer \ufb01sh, particularly fewer adult\nones), the other due to changes in\nphysiology (each \ufb01sh is smaller). The\ne\ufb00ect is particularly marked in tropical regions.\nThe model is, of course, limited\nby necessary simpli\ufb01cations and as-sumptions. The scientists attempted\nto reduce the uncertainty carried over\nfrom the used predictions of climate\ndevelopments over the next years by\nusing two di\ufb00erent earth system models and \ufb01nding areas of agreement between the two results.\nDOI: 10.1038/nclimate1691\nWriter\nes of testing; the road from drug discovery to general therapeutic use is\na long one, and the process may take\nseveral years.

Only when the\ndrug reaches the stage of randomised\ncontrolled trials in which its e\ufb00ectiveness is compared with existing\ntreatments, will it be clear whether\nMinnelide can really live up to its\npromising beginnings.\nThe shrinking of the fish\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 26 OCTOBER\n16\nI\nAnnina Sartor\nImprovements in carbon dating\nA new study of sediment cores from\nLake Suigetsu, Japan, has the potential to improve the accuracy of the\nradiocarbon dating techniques used\nwidely by archaeologists and climate\nscientists.\nRadiocarbon (14C) has a known\nhalf-life of ~5,700 years and is absorbed equally by organic processes.\nScientists can then \ufb01nd the age of\nsuch objects by seeing how the ratio\nof radiogenic to non-radiogenic carbon (12C) has changed. However this\ncan only be found accurately if the\noriginal, atmospheric ratio of carbon\nis known.\nThis can be measured directly from\ntree-rings up to ~12,500 years ago.\nBeyond this point are other climate\nproxies such as ice cores, marine\nsediments and speleothems (cave\ndeposits) but these require assumptions about the reaction of ocean or\ngroundwater carbon to atmospheric\nchanges or local climate conditions.\nAt Lake Suigetsu the accumulation\nof a \ufb01ne layer of seasonal algae allows\nresearchers to count back the years\nof each layer, called varves, just like\na tree ring. Radiocarbon from microscopic plant fragments was then\nMatthew Parker Writer measured to \ufb01nd the analogous atmospheric radiocarbon at the time\neach varve was deposited. With the\nnew sediment cores, researchers now\nhave a complete terrestrial record\ndating back up to ~52,000 years.\nA \u2018control period\u2019 of the \ufb01rst 12,000\nyears was anchored against the\nknown tree-ring record. The Suigetsu\ndata was then compared to two spe-leothem sets (dated using U-Th de-cay) and was found to lie within the\ndeviation expected of the two di\ufb00erent time scales. The potential of sediment cores at Lake Suigetsu for dating was \ufb01rst recognised in 1993 but\nthe original core included missing in-tervals, which made an independent\nage impossible. A further four cores\n(funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council) were taken\nin 2006.\nAlthough this discovery is not expected to cause any major historical\nrevisions it will allow archaeologists\nto improve dating accuracy by up to\nseveral centuries. This will also help\nscientists understand the carbon-cy-cle, particularly the mechanisms that\ntransport atmospheric carbon into\nother radiocarbon sinks, such as in\nthe oceans.\nDOI: 10.1126/science.1226660\nXtyn24/stock.xchng\nThe God Vine\nNemo ate the mushrooms\nand lost himself.

I am appalled that\nthis paper is printing such baseless\nfantastical tripe.

I can only\nhope that few people have been swayed\nby this misguided attempt at journal-ism.\nAnonymous, via website\nGeorge Butcher\nn Friday Andrew Mitchell - the Government\u2019s\nchief whip - resigned\nafter a confrontation with a policeman that happened over a month\nago, involving a gate, a bike and\n(possibly) the word \u2018pleb\u2019. It was\nall a bit awkward; especially\nsince the policeman and Mr\nMitchell gave differing accounts.\nSomeone was lying and since Mr\nMitchell is a politician, chances\nare it was he.\nThe best defence I heard of\nthe policeman was from Edith Hall, professor of classics\nat King\u2019s College London who\nsaid that \u2018pleb\u2019 was \u201cjust not\nthe sort of thing a policeman\nwould invent\u201d. Not sure\nif I would take that\nas a complement or\nnot. Is knowledge of\nclassical insults something to brag about?\nWhat amused me\nthroughout the saga was\nthe multitude of headlines you\ncould get out of such a simple case\nof idiocy. Search the BBC\u2019s website for \u201cpleb\u201d and you\u2019ll find a huge\nlist of relevant headlines. Examples\nof the most inciteful include:\n\u201cIs Pleb an insult?\u201d, \u201c Who\nsays \u2018pleb\u2019 nowadays?\u201d,\n\u201cAndrew Mitchell is \u2018toast\u2019 says\nMiliband\u201d and\n\u201cAlex Salmond\nc o n d e m n s\nUK govern-m e n t \u2019 s\n\u2018 L o r d\nSnootys\u2019\u201d. I counted around 30 articles on the BBC alone written over\nthe course of a month: a rate of one\na day. All about something that - no\nmatter your point of view - is largely\nirrelevant to everyone. What is there\nto say? What could the 24th article\npossibly have said that wasn\u2019t covered in the preceding 23? Why did\nthese people take it upon themselves\nto say exactly the same as someone\nelse the day before? And that\u2019s just\nthe BBC. I tried to search the Daily Mail\u2019s website but my computer\ncrashed due to an ignorance over-load.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong; no one in\npolitics has a nice word to say about\nAndrew Mitchell. It sounds like he\u2019s\noffensive and arrogant, but the attention he has been given is bizarrely overwhelming.\nWell it\u2019s over now. He\u2019s resigned.\nI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll enjoy a lovely redundancy package and everybody else\ncan feel rather righteous. But the\nreal loser is the general public; there\nwas once a time when if you were\ninterested in politics and wanted to\nmake a difference, you ran for of-fice. Now, you become a journalist\nand rant about the people who did.\nWWIt\u2019s so very easy to criticise; just\nlook at me!\nI have great respect for (some)\npoliticians. They have chosen a profession that offers little in return, for\nliving away from their families and\nbeing hated by default.

Teachers, nurses, \ufb01re\ufb01ghters, professors, factory workers,\npoliticians, actors, and many more\n\u2013 all there to oppose what they saw\nas damage being done to ordinary\npeople\u2019s lives and the economy.\nThe police say 100,000 people took\nto the streets; the TUC (Trade Unions\nCouncil) say 150,000. Perhaps this\ndoes not sound like many, but this\nmeans that the march, which started\nat midday at Embankment, lasted until\nnearly 5pm, when the last marchers\nreached the \ufb01nish point in Hyde Park.\nWinding through the streets and\navoiding the socialist/communist/\nMarxist paper sellers, the union\nmembersmadetheirvoicesheard\u2013\u201cno\nifs, no buts, no NHS cuts\u201d; \u201cI\u2019d rather\nbe a pleb than a Tory\u201d; and the eternal\n\u201cGeneral Strike Now!\u201d chants rang\naround Central London. Vuvuzelas,\nwhistles and union marching bands\n(the Fire Brigade Union had a bagpipe\nband) added to the noise.\nWorkers on the march were angry at\njob cuts, bene\ufb01t cuts and pay freezes\nwhilst the cost of living continues\nto rise. People were struggling to\nunderstand why the coalition would\nchoose to make life so hard for some\nof Britain\u2019s lowest paid workers in the\nname of austerity to help the economy.\nYet the economy continues to face\ncontraction, and the budget de\ufb01cit\nrises. The TUC makes the argument\nthat making cuts whilst we are still in a\nrecession costs the government more\nin the long run, as more people out\nof work reduces income tax receipts\nto the treasury, and the government\nhas to pay out even more in bene\ufb01ts\nto those without jobs. Their slogan\n\u201cInvestment not cuts\u201d was oft repeated\nin the speeches at the rally.\nEd Miliband also addressed the\ncrowds at the rally. Cheered for his\npromise to repeal the NHS changes\npassed by this Government, he faced\na spattering of jeers for repeating the\nLabour Party policy that some cuts\nare necessary. Miliband also took\nthe Tories to task, \u201cAndrew Mitchell\nmay have resigned, but the culture\nof two nations runs right across\nthis government. They cut taxes for\nmillionaires, and they raise taxes for\nordinary families.\u201d\nThe Conservatives were naturally\nsceptical of the protest, and of\nLabour\u2019s presence at the march.\nDavid Cameron tweeted, \u201cToday Ed\nMiliband is headlining a rally calling\nfor an end to every single spending\ncut needed to clear the de\ufb01cit\n#labourisntlearning.\u201d Grant \u2018Michael\nGreen\u2019 Shapps, the Conservative Party\nChairperson, had also said, \u201cAt today\u2019s\nmarch, Ed Miliband will be among\nfriends \u2013 supporting his union donors\nwho oppose every single one of our\nspending cuts. You can\u2019t be serious\nabout clearing the de\ufb01cit when you\nattend a march that calls for an end to\nausterity.\u201d\nMost of the people present,\nhowever, weren\u2019t interested in political\npositioning from either party \u2013 they\nwere there because they were angry\nabout job cuts and loss of services,\nand worried about the future of the\ncountry\u2019s welfare system. Placards\nranged from the satirical \u201cOsborne: If\nyou want \ufb01rst class services, you\u2019ve got\nto pay for them\u201d to the tragedy written\nby a young boy, \u201cI\u2019m going deaf\u2026 the\nNHS can\u2019t a\ufb00ord to operate\u201d.\nCaps to housing bene\ufb01t are forcing\nfamilies to choose between heating\nand food; disabled people are losing\ntheir living allowance and struggling\nto support themselves; and one million\nyoung people are unemployed.

The reality of the cuts\nare biting, and with two and a half\nyears to wait until the next general\nelection, people are struggling to see\nany way to make things better.\nKirstin Hay\nT\n\u201cI\u2019ve never even kissed a Tory, why should I be fucked by one?\u201d\nFor the whole month of October,\nmillions of people have held their\nbreath as the highly climatic\npresidential debates took place,\nculminating in next Tuesday\u2019s federal\nelection. Beginning on October 3rd,\nthe series of three debates enable the\nDemocrat and Republican hopefuls\nto hammer their electoral platform\non the American populace and try\nto smash their opponent\u2019s arguments\ninto pieces. Here\u2019s a recap for those\nwho missed the \ufb01ghts:\nRound 1 : domestic policy\nThe energy around presidential\ndebates usually starts slow and\nsteadily builds. Yet this year we have\nseen Romney take a full-blooded\nstart and deliver an almost knockout\nperformance in the \ufb01rst debate on\ndomestic policy on Wednesday,\nOctober 3rd. For the 90 minute\ndebate, Romney pounded Obama\non his dismal record on jobs, debt\nand economic growth. What didn\u2019t\nhelp in countering the Republican\nchallenger\u2019s feistiness was Obama\u2019s\napparent apathy \u2013 he simply didn\u2019t\nlook like he wanted to be there.\nEven when the candidates discussed\nMedicare \u2013 with Obama hinting\nRomney would turn it into a voucher\nsystem \u2013 most of the talk was around\ndomestic economy, or how the US\nwould get out of its rut. The stagnation\nthat lingered throughout the Obama\nadministration didn\u2019t help as a proof\nof the President\u2019s capabilities, and\nRomney took full advantage of this.\nAs he relentlessly attacked Obama on\nhis failure to strengthen the economic\nsituation in the US, the only point the\nincumbent managed was to sneer at\nthe vagueness of Romney\u2019s tax cuts\nand de\ufb01cit reduction plan.\nCNN/ORC International poll on\nwho won the debate: Romney 67%,\nObama 25%.\nRound 2: Up for Grabs\nAfter the \ufb01rst presidential debate,\ndominated by Romney, which\nspread fears that Obama had lost his\n\ufb01erce spirit, the second presidential\ndebate held on October 16th saw the\nPresident take back the combative\nattitude that animated his \ufb01rst\ncampaign. The candidates\u2019 personal\nhostility towards one another clearly\nshowed through almost aggressive\nclashes over topics that covered\ndomestic energy production, taxes,\nthe attack on the US consulate in\nLibya, immigration and women\u2019s\nissues.\nWhile the debate started on level\ngrounds, the \ufb01ghting began when\nenergy policy was at play. While both\ncandidates are proponents of energy\nindependence \u2013 and so is the rest\nof the American population \u2013 their\nstrategy to get there di\ufb00ers highly.\nObama made a point of the need for\nrenewable energy on top of exploiting\nshale gas and increasing domestic oil\nand coal production, while Romney\npromised a pipeline to provide the US\nwith oil from the Canadian tar sands\nand a surge in o\ufb00shore drilling in\nAlaska. A tangle over whether energy\nproduction on federal land increased\nor decreased in the last four years\nbrought the opponents to a close\nup, but the mixed statistics served\nactually made the entire argument\nconfusing and inconclusive.\nRomney started losing steam when\ntargeting Obama\u2019s reaction to the\nattack made on the US consulate\nin Benghazi, the President tactfully\nvolleying back on criticism for\nprematurely condemning the source\nof the attack as an \u2018act of terror\u2019. But\nit was over a discussion on women\u2019s\nworking conditions that Romney took\nit on the chin: wanting to highlight\nhe was encouraging of women roles\nat the o\ufb03ce, he declared he had\nbeen through \u201cwhole binders full\nof women\u201d when looking to recruit\ncabinet members as Massachusetts\ngovernor\u2026\nAs the antipathy between the two\ncandidates rose in the last minutes of\nthe debate, with both sides speaking\nover their allowed period (2 minutes),\nObama delivered the \ufb01nal blow\nby mentioning the secret video in\nwhich Romney dismissed 47% of the\nAmerican voters as freeloaders.\nCNN/ORC International poll on\nwho won the debate: Obama 46%,\nRomney 39%.\nRound 3 : foreign policy\nThe second debate set the stage for\na real combat between Obama and\nRomney, with high hopes that the\nlast and typically most-watched\ndebate could dislodge Homeland on\nthe viewership in US homes. Could\nObama maintain his \u2018Yes we can\u2019\nmomentum despite the weight of his\n\ufb01rst term? Would Romney\u2019s grip on\nhis electoral platform be as sturdy as\nhis immaculate hair? Unfortunately,\nboth candidates seemed to have\nthrown all their best punches in the\nprior wrangles and kept themselves\nvery moderate on last Monday,\nOctober 22nd\u2019s debate, centered on\nspring-revolutionized-Egypt, messy\nwithdrawals in Afghanistan, nuclear\nthreats from Iran, the looming power\nof China and\u2026 the national de\ufb01cit?\nTruth is: there aren\u2019t massive\ndi\ufb00erences between Democrat\nand Conservative policies on most\nforeign matters. Romney was not\ndisagreeing with Obama\u2019s \ufb01rst term\ntactics, but mostly just said he could\nhave done better. After Romney\u2019s\ntactless remarks about the London\nOlympics or his inconsistent stances\non Afghanistan, the rest of the world\ncould question his credibility on the\nworld stage, but American voters\ndo not care that much about foreign\npolicy at the moment, and both\ncandidates know that well.\nObama defended his cuts on\nmilitary expenditure, yet the bottom\nline of Romney discussing the US\ndefence budget isn\u2019t really about\nwhether the US should spend as\nmuch as China, but rather a matter of\nnational economic stimulus. In fact,\nthe discussions of the third debate\nreadily veered towards domestic\npolicy (even if they shouldn\u2019t have),\nreiterating the same lines as the \ufb01rst\nand second debates. In a nutshell, the\nlast debate was not very informative\nand a bit dull. Back to primetime telly.\nCNN/ORC International poll on\nwho won the last debate: Obama\n48%, Romney 40%. (With a 4.5% error\nmargin\u2026)\nSo what is the verdict in the end? It\u2019s\na split decision. There are no clear cut\nwinners from the presidential debates.\nWith some key issues that have not\nbeen discussed during the debates\n\u2013 gay rights, abortion and climate\nchange amongst others \u2013 current polls\nwaddle every day. This means the next\nPresident of the United States will be\ndecided by a small proportion of still\nundecided voters \u2013 the equivalent of\nholding the world in their hands.\nWriter\n\n"

    "content": "MUSIC\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter,\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Martinez de Rituerto\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nYou Don\u2019t Have To\nCall It Music\nPt. 3 musique concr\u00e8te\nby \u00cd\u00f1igo Martinez de Rituerto\nTowards the end of the 1920s, some, including Stravinsky, were alluding\nto the possibility of writing music for gramophones as had been done for\nviolins or pianos before. The new paradigm came with the new technologies developed after WWII, namely magnetic tape. Despite contemporary\ncomposers\u2019 advances in revolutionizing the orchestra, some felt their efforts were not enough. Trying to penetrate the mass of musical imagination with brass and wood was tantamount to laboring new tricks away on\nold dogs.\nWhat did this mean then for music? Talking about recorded sound, one\nrealized we were not limited to just recording instruments \u2013 the most contrived scenario. Telecommunications had focused on transmitting recorded voice over large distances. The voice can of course be used to sing and\nbecomes an instrument in its own right. But what if we go the other way\naround? From the level of aesthetics to that of utility, and consider the underlying form of the function itself. That is what American dadaist Marcel\nDuchamp did when taking a urinal, dubbing it Fountain and calling it art. A\nradical change of perspective was beginning to take form.\nIn the same way, one could now record a train track and call on its rhythm\nas a basis for the inherent musicality of the sound. This is exactly what\nPierre Schaeffer did in 1948 with \u00c9tude aux chemins de fer. He recorded\nthe various noises of a steam train: its wheels chugging along the tracks,\nthe whistles blowing fervently, coal spilling into a furnace and metal clanging and screeching all around. He then arranged these sounds in to a sort\nof collage. (Famously, he defined music as \u201corganized sound\u201d.) Besides the\nobvious harmony of the whistles and the rhythm of the tracks, its musicality lied in the character of the sounds themselves \u2013 not in how well they\nimitated traditional instruments. Indeed, just as a violin or a piano have\na certain sound, so does the grinding of metal upon metal. In contrast, a\nviolin string reverberating through a finely crafted wooden body seems a\nfantastically convoluted way to make noise.\nUltimately, what Schaeffer wanted was to distance the listener from the\ncontext; not to imagine himself by the railroad but to immerse himself in\nthe sounds themselves. To meditate on the vibrations of the air particles;\nwhich behaved this way and that; which moved and modulated them-selves, and had a character all of their own.\nAfter meeting percussionist Pierre Henry, the two founded the Groupe\nde Recherche de Musique Concr\u00e8te at the RTF broadcast station in Paris.\nMany of the most forward thinking composers of the time passed through\nthe studio, and indeed the Parisian community made a name for itself\nwhich such illustrious members as Iannis Xenakis, who designed the\nPhilips Pavilion for Expo \u201958 based on his piece Metastasis, and Edgard\nVar\u00e8se, who wrote Po\u00e8me \u00e9lectronique especially for the highly spatialized\nsound system contained therein. Their greatest triumph was not only in\ncreating music from any sound imaginable but rather lending their ears to\nthese natural noises in the first place. Like Duchamp, they observed their\nsurroundings in a different light. It was a matter of perspectives. As Heidegger ruminated in Being and Time, the object was now considered for its\nown sake rather than as a mere tool. Its purpose was itself.\nTheir influence has been felt through generations. Almost simultane-ously, Karlheinz Stockhausen used these concepts in his Cologne studio\nto found Elektronische Musik, the subject of next week\u2019s column. The\nabstraction of sounds from their objects has been an inspiration to many,\nsuch as experimental hip-hop spearhead Flying Lotus, who more often\nusesfieldrecordingsforpercussionsthanstandarddrumsamples.Berliners\nEinst\u00fcrzende Neubauten looked for musicality in everyday objects when\nthey fashioned instruments from industrial waste; making drums out of\nsteel barrels, xylophones out of pipes, a bass guitar from a metal coil or using an air pressurizer to blow through wind instruments. Their antics have\nbeen bravely capitalized by the world-famous Blue Man Group. Recently,\nMilanese musician Giuseppe Ielasi produced Tools, an album whose tracks\nare named after the single material from which they were made (\u2018Rubber\nBand\u2019 and \u2018Polystyrene Box\u2019 resulting in some pretty serious beats).\nSearching for a new music, beyond the artifices of conventional instru-mentation, musique concr\u00e8te turned to the world for a muse. They opened\nour ears to the acoustic richness of our own environment and redefined\nmusic as a part of nature.\nFRIDAY 26 OCTOBER\n36\nHot Chip are hot\nLooking moody and cool.\nHe is french after all...\nI\u2019ve never really understood where\nHot Chip \ufb01t in. Having shot to musical prominence during the years\nof \u2018nu-rave\u2019 (terrible clothes, a lot of\ndick heads but hell, the music was\nfun), the band mix catchy pop ri\ufb00s\nand delicate vocals with synths that\ntime and again slay the dance\ufb02oor.\nThis combination helped the band\npass through through the years of\nnu-rave unscathed - Hadouken, Test\nIcicles where are you now? In many\nways Hot Chip were the antithesis\nof most nu-rave bands; Joe Goddard\nand Alexis Taylor (the two founding members) went to university at\nOxford and Cambridge respective-ly. They also play the stereotypical\nnerd very well indeed and nowadays\nare old enough to be some of their\nyounger fans\u2019 dads. They\u2019re not your\nstereotypical electro-pop act, and\nneither are they a balls to the wall\ndance collective; that leaves only one\nconclusion: they don\u2019t \ufb01t in.\nThis was a question I was trying to\ngrapple with last Friday at Brixton\nAcademy, whilst seeing Hot Chip\nperform live for the \ufb01rst time in my\nsix years of buying their CDs.\nThe night itself was kicked o\ufb00 by\nDjango Django, the much hyped\nlads who met at college in Edinburgh.\nDubiously wearing matching shirts,\nthey put in a performance that was\nworthy of their Mercury Music Prize\nnomination while still exhibiting the\namateur modesty of a band not long\ngraduated from performing in pubs.\nAs we waited for Hot Chip to take to\nthe stage the theatre became increasingly packed - never before have I\nbeen surrounded by so many people\nthat I truly believe would have been\nable to recite the BBC 6 Music schedule by heart. But I shouldn\u2019t general-ise too much; there were also a few\nlads wearing day-glo caps, awkwardly\nstuck in 2007.\nFinally Hot Chip took to the stage,\nploughing the raging synth/drum\ncombination of \u2018Shake a Fist\u2019 through\nthe dance \ufb02oor. While their studio-produced album tracks range from\nthe delicate to the solid head-nod-inducing, live Hot Chip beef up the\nsynthesisers and pound out the bass.\nWhile this made for great interpretations of their studio recordings, it\nalso posed a dilemma to a large portion of the crowd who were there\nwith partners and deemed it inappropriate to wind the clock back six years\nand throw their forearms in wild, yet\nrhythmic patterns.\nApart from considering the existential curiosities of Hot Chip, another\nthing that struck me during the performance was the sheer size of their\nback catalogue these days. A near two\nhour show was \ufb01lled with highlights\nof their work; not once did the material feel as if it was acting as \ufb01ller.\nHalf way through the show the band\nwound it down brie\ufb02y to exhibit the\nbeautiful melancholy of Alexis Taylor\u2019s vocals, but the highlight of the\nshow came as Valentino claimed the\nstage to perform the incredible \u2018Gabriel\u2019 she released with Joe Goddard.\nIndeed the power of her voice blew\neveryone away, this live rendition far\nbetter than the studio-produced re-lease.\nIn the eight years since Hot Chip\u2019s\n\ufb01rst full length release they\u2019ve always\ndone their own thing; they undoubtedly in\ufb02uenced the rise of nu-rave but\nthe real testament to their success is\nhow they carried on unblemished\nlong after it had vanished. That the\nband doesn\u2019t \ufb01t into boxes prescribed\nby music nazis is a testament to what\nmakes their albums end up on repeat\nand their gigs so much fun.\nBastille triumphant at Koko\nKoko is one of the most perfect venues for pop gigs. Its red velvet and gold\ninterior, in the style of an opera house,\nmakes it super kitsch, especially when\ntopped o\ufb00 with its huge silver spinning\nglitterball overhead, as if present by divine right.\nGlancing across the dance-\ufb02oor up to\nthe balconies and the imitation private\nboxes, they were packed full of excited\nbeings anticipating the arrival of one\nman\u2019s musical project: Bastille.\nIt was clear from the sported merch\ntees, handmade posters, singing to\nevery word, and clapping in all the right\nplaces that these were hardcore fans.\nThe band de\ufb01nitely fed o\ufb00 their buzz\nand which they rewarded with an energetic live set.\nBastille made no fault. They were\ntight. The vocals soared. The bass ran\nright through you. The singer\u2019s charisma generated de\ufb01nite stage presence.\nThey managed to translate their studio\nrecordings into an engaging live experi-ence, but this is all what you would expect from a good gig.\nThe only fault, if there had to be one,\nwas that there was nothing strikingly\noriginal about Bastille. Their coming-of-age pop attracted a predominantly\nyoung audience, inducing nostalgia\nin most gig-goers. These reminders of\nyour teenage past are what demonstrate\nthe band\u2019s lack of originality. Their covers of City High\u2019s \u2018What Would You\nDo?\u2019 and Snap!\u2019s \u2018Rhythm is a Dancer\u2019\nwere the most fun part of the night.\nPop with lyrical social commentary\nand slight depth has been done before\nand will probably always be produced,\nalthough this is not to say its value is di-minished. Every generation needs these\nkinds of artists to introduce them to\nappreciation of music, and sometimes\nappreciation in a wider world thanks to\nmusic. Perhaps this is Bastille\u2019s time to\n\ufb01ll that role.\nBastille are very good at what they do,\nbut the question is whether what they\ndo is good. You would have had to have\nseen the devotion of the audience to answer that question.\nSimon Hunter Music Editor\nLily Le Writer\nIn researching this\narticle it came to my\nattention that Alexis\nTaylor is also the name\nof an American adult\nfilm actress\n\n"

In the second half, the attack began\nto relax into the game after a slightly\nmanic start and drew out the defence as\nusing the perimeter proved to be an effective way of scoring. Victory was clear\nwith a \ufb01nal score of 26-2 and Jahnvi Karia deservedly being voted as Man of the\nMatch. Best wishes to Kat Roele, one of\nthe veteran \ufb01rst players, who was injured\nin the match: we all hope she makes a\nspeedy recovery!\nLizzie Allen, 1\u2019s Captain said \u201cI am so\nimpressed with the level of talent that\nthe new freshers have shown - should be\nan exciting season! Can\u2019t wait to battle\nour old rivals UCL. Reading was a good\nwarm up and we managed to practise\nsomegoodplaysbutallinallwestillneed\nto improve as a team and work together\nLAX women crush opposition\nSports Writer\nThe Womens\u2019 2nds lacrosse team\nplayed and won their \ufb01rst match of\nthe season against Hertfordshire on\nWednesday the 17th of October. The\nteam was composed of a 50:50 mixture of seasoned players and fresh\nfaces who had only picked up a stick\nfor the \ufb01rst time two weeks before.\nTaking this into consideration the success of the match was a testament to\nthe team and the hard work and keen\ndrive of the players. The victory was a\nconvincing one of 9-5 with the main\ngoal scorers being, Annie MondonBallantyne , Catherine Hedley and\nGen Pugh.\nDue to issues with the minibus and\ntra\ufb03c on the way to Hertfordshire the\nteam arrived with only time for a very\nshort warm up before being thrown\nonto the pitch with some players not\neven knowing the positions they were\nmeant to be playing. The \ufb01rst goal was\nto Hertfordshire in the early minutes\nof the game; with Imperial still trying\nto get it\u2019s bearing. But back to centre,\nreset and it was clear Herts were not\nto be quite so lucky again. This time\naround, Imperial dominated possession with Hertfordshire showing clear\nweakness when it came to defending\ngoals, and the quarter \ufb01nished with 4\ngoals in our favour to their 1.\nThe second and third quarters continued with Imperial maintaining the\nupper hand, the players new and old\nshowing increased con\ufb01dence as the\nmatch progressed, \ufb01ghting hard for\nevery ground ball and making some\nexcellent tackles. Members who had\nplayed the year before were showing\nremarkable improvement all round\nwith the force of their play and getting\nstuck in with much more zeal than the\nprevious season. Particular improvement was noticeable in Louisa Dyer,\nAlice Wickham and Hannah Thrower.\nHertfordshire were able to score 1\ngoal per quarter in the 2nd and 3rd\nquarters, all by their centre: their team\ncaptain and evidently star player too.\nThe Imperial team were still yet to\nhave a proper tactics training session\nand shutting one player down at all\ntimes proved a challenge. The defence\nworked hard to get to grips with dou-ble-teaming quickly and succeeded\nin holding o\ufb00 most Hertfordshire advances with fantastic defensive work\nby Vi Tran and Hannah Tullett, and of\ncourse Tania Buckthorp (goalie) too.\nBy the \ufb01nal quarter it was clear that\nImperial\u2019s \ufb01tness was lagging, a weakness exacerbated by the shortage of\nsubs compared to the opponent\u2019s\nWomens 2\u2019s Captain\nteam. Hertfordshire\u2019s centre was able\nto break away and scored a \ufb01nal 2\ngoals despite the incredible perseverance of Jordon Mcdonald, valiantly\nattempting centre in her \ufb01rst match\nand subsequently being crowned Man\nof the Match for her impressive ef-fort. Nevertheless, Imperial still held\na comfortable lead with several goal\nattempts being made in the \ufb01nal quarter and the match ending in a \ufb02ourish\nwith Imperial\u2019s 9th goal being scored\nby Gen Pugh in the last 20 seconds.\nOf the \ufb01nal result the Seconds Captain said \u201cI\u2019m really impressed by how\nquickly the new girls have picked up\nthe basic stick skills needed to play\nLacrosse, its shown how valuable the\ntime we have spent teaching has been.\nI am unbelievably proud of both the\nnew girls and old members: every\nsingle person really got stuck into the\nmatch and gave it their all. It was brilliant seeing everyone working so hard\nand yet having fun at the same time.\u201d\nImperial Womens\u2019 lacrosse has got\no\ufb00 to a rip roaring start and the teams\nseem to be going from strength to\nstrength with much being gained from\nmatch play for both new and old play-ers.

Lack\nof familiarity within the 1sts and small\nmistakes give plenty to work on in train-ing,andwithastrongfoundationtobuild\non the quality of play can only improve.\nThe game ended 40-24 to QM.\nThe 3rds also had a tough game, taking on the strongest team in the league,\nUCL 3rds. Good play by the 3rds was not\nenough to stop UCL dominating, regardless of this the 3rds played on hard with\nthe score ending 60-20 to UCL. Nancy\nEdge\u2019s great work in the centre court\nearned her man of the match.\nThe 2nds had a home game and took\non RHUL 2nds, after a win the previous\nWednesday our heads were held high\nbut we were very aware that this would\nbe a tough game. Unfortunately, the \ufb01rst\nquarter ended with IC behind Royal Holloway by 8 goals, heads started to drop,\nmaybe this wasn\u2019t going to be as easy to\ncome back from as Wednesday, but an\ninspirational team talk form Captain Abi\nandsomechangesoncourtsaweveryone\nready to \ufb01ght back. RHUL had a very tall\nGoal Shooter, making it almost impossible for GK Emma Dixon to defend effectively even with the help of Catherine\nBurrows and so over half time we had to\nchange our tactics and focus on blocking the Goal Attack out of the circle in\nthe hope that this would stop them from\nscoring so many goals. The \ufb01rst half ended 26-18 to RHUL. The change of tactics\nproved successful, with Toni Semmence\ndrawing contact from the GA. Fantastic\ninterceptions by Rebecca Tyne, Sarah\nSimmonds and Emily Rolfe ensured by\nthe end of the third quarter IC were only\nbehind by 2 goals. Throughout the \ufb01nal\nquarter IC managed to maintain the 2\ngoal di\ufb00erence until the last 2 minutes\nwhere a turnover in midcourt led to us\nscoring, leaving us only one goal behind\nwith only 1 minute to go. It was then\nour centre pass and after a few turnovers\nand a scrappy 30 seconds by both teams\nAbi managed to feed the ball to Hannah\nWeekes who scored the winning goal\nwith both defenders out of play and only\nsecondslefttospare,talkaboutpressure!!\nFantastic movement from both Harriet Rumgay and Hannah in the \u2018D\u2019 gave\nHannah joint man of the match with\nToni.

The 4ths took on\nKCL 5ths with almost a completely new\nteam from last year. The game started\nslowly with most of the action being in\nthe centre court. The 4ths started to fall\nbehind but would not be deterred and\nfought right to the end with a respectable\n\ufb01nal score of 9-3 to KCL.

    "content": "Steakday, bloody steakday\nHere during the Halloween season,\nwe\u2019re more than happy to cater to all\nlevels of \u201cvampirism\u201d \u2013 and by that, we\nmean we\u2019re going to scrutinize how to\ncook the perfect beef steak.\nFirst up, pick your pieces. We don\u2019t\ndiscriminate on cut, but one thing\nwe\u2019re certainly picky about is quality.\nWith steak you get what you pay for,\nso get chummy with your butcher \u2013\nor, if you must, go for the fresh counter in the supermarket. Whatever you\ndo, don\u2019t you DARE reach for the pre-packed meats in the Tesco chiller cab-inets. Dickenson\u2019s on 365 North End\nRoad is one of our favourite picks for\nquality meat without the crazy price\ntag \u2013 it\u2019s well worth checking out.\nA good steak should be deep red in\ncolour and have su\ufb03cient fat marbling\nthrough it (look for the faint white\nlines), as this ensures great \ufb02avour and\nthat the steak won\u2019t dry out during\ncooking. Get your butcher to trim the\nfatty layer on the steak if it\u2019s too thick\n\u2013 you\u2019ll need a bit for \ufb02avour, around\nhalf a centimetre should do.\nNext must-have: ageing. Done properly beforehand by your butcher, this\ndevelops the \ufb02avor and makes sure\nyour meat will be tender so it won\u2019t\nturn out the texture of tyre rubber.\nAsk your butcher how long it\u2019s been\nhung for \u2013 rule of thumb is that you\nwant it aged between 21-35 days.\nSo you\u2019ve \ufb01nally brought it home,\nnow it\u2019s time to cook! Whether you\u2019re\ncooking it immediately or storing it in\nthe fridge for later, it\u2019s crucial to make\nsure you bring the steak up to room\ntemperature. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be \u201cenjoying\u201d a piece of meat that\u2019s seared\noutside but stone-cold in the centre.\nGrab a heavy-bottomed pan and\nwhack it on high heat. Cast iron is\ngood if you can get it; but as long as it\u2019s\ngot a thick/heavy bottom it\u2019ll do \u2013 try\nto avoid non-stick because it makes it\nharder for a crust to form. Add a thin\nlayer of oil, and season your steak with\nsalt while you wait for it to get smoking hot so it kick-starts the formation\nof that lovely crust (no pepper yet, it\u2019ll\nburn!) Once you see your oil start to\nsmoke a teensy bit, gently place the\nsteak in the pan and let it sizzle.\nThis is where cooking technique\nstarts to fall into two distinct camps.\nSome say you shouldn\u2019t touch it until it\u2019s had its few minutes on its \ufb01rst\nside so you won\u2019t disturb the crust,\nwhile others say you should \ufb02ip it every 15-20 seconds to prevent it from\novercooking in the centre. We\u2019ve had\nsuccess either way without the crust\nor centre being a\ufb00ected, though we\npersonally prefer \ufb02ipping every so\noften \u2013 maybe because we\u2019ve just got\nitchy-\ufb01ed \ufb01ngers and can\u2019t be still in\nthe kitchen. It\u2019s your call though.\nNow, the part where things commonly go tits-up: done-ness. Judging\nby the fact that steak thickness/pans/\ntypes will vary, we feel it\u2019s quite hit\nand miss to give you times \u2013 a 2cm-thick sirloin needs a di\ufb00erent cooking\ntime compared to a 3cm-thick rib eye.\nThere\u2019s no need to cut into it and risk\nruining your steak though \u2013 we suggest either the touch test (takes a while\nFOOD\n39\nFRIDAY 26 OCTOBER\nFood Editors: Carol Ann Cheah,\nSophia Goldberg, Yiango\nMavrocostanti\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCarol Ann Cheah Food Editor\nto get the hang of, even for chefs), or\ngo all Imperial-geek-style and use a\nfood probe to check internal tempera-ture.\nThe guidelines are as follows:\nBleu (45-49\u00b0C): Soft and squishy \u2013\nyou\u2019ll probably get some blood on your\nhands after touching it. A vampire\nwould be proud.\nRare (49-52\u00b0C): Soft to the touch.\nMedium rare (52-64\u00b0C): Yields gently\nwhen touched. We\u2019re impartial to having our steaks done this way.\nMedium (57-60\u00b0C): Starts to firm up\nbut still yields slightly.\nMedium well (60-65\u00b0C): Feels firm.\nWell done (>65\u00b0C): Hard to touch \u2013\ndare we say \u201clike a rock\u201d? Also known\nas a bloody waste of good meat.\nWhen you\u2019re done, take the steak\nout of the pan and set it aside to rest\n\u2013 residual heat means it\u2019ll carry on\ncooking for a little bit, and it\u2019s important that you let it rest for around 5\nminutes so that the meat has a chance\nto reabsorb its juices. If you cut it fresh\nout of the pan you\u2019ll leak said juices\nand end up eating thick leather.\nAnd there you have it \u2013 steak cooked\nsimply in this way means you get to\nfully enjoy quality meat that hasn\u2019t\nhad its \ufb02avours tampered with unnecessary extras.\nSimply season a little more with pepper and drizzle the cooking and resting juices over. Serve with potatoes\non the side (we\u2019re big fans of chunky\nfries/chips), along with some greens\nto knock down the guilt factor of this\nsometimes-tricky-to-make treat.\nEnjoy your bloody steak this Halloween!\nKeen foodie?

The draft Constitution refers to \u201cthe Union\u201d proposing the budget to the Trustee Board,\nwho then must approve it. However,\nit does not explicitly state there who\nthat refers to. It is thought that this is a\npoint that could change. When asked\nabout this point, Beaumont said that\nis was Council or Exec., because that\nis who runs the Union. This issue was\ncontentious because if it is not one\nof these bodies, then the money and\ntherefore overall running would not\nbe controlled by democratically elected students.\nTheCourt\u2019sdocumentsetsoutwhere\nthe budget comes from as something\nthat it believes removes student control from the Union and how it is run.\nThe response from Beaumont is: \u201cThe\nTrustee Board sets the Union\u2019s budget.\nThe Exec currently has the power to\nundermine the Trustee Board which\nis the fundamental problem we\u2019re trying to address (and is how we ended\nup in the \ufb01nancial situation we\u2019re in\ntoday \u2013 Summer Ball 2011 was passed\nby the Exec). Making reference to students implies we\u2019re removing control\nfrom students, but, the Trustee Board\nis (under the current and proposed\nstructures) majority students!!\u201d. The\npoint about the control of students relates to the membership of the Board,\nwhere there is disagreement as to\nwhether or not the proposed changes\nwill cause the Board to be more student run as elected representatives sit\non it, or will hand a small number of\nstudents a lot of power and therefore\nbe less student run.\nThe members of Council that were\nelected in the results announced on\nthe Union\u2019s website will be voting.\nThey may not all have experience with\nthe inner workings of the Union and\nso some will have had to familiarise\nthemselves with the Union\u2019s current\nstructure and the di\ufb00erences caused\nby the changes. When asked about\nthe amount of time received to review\nthe changes, Beaumont stated that the\nmembers had been sent everything\nwhen running for the post, and had\nbeen resent it later. He also pointed\nout that the Council Chair will be\nbrie\ufb01ng them on Monday 29 October,\nand he will be seeing what concerns\nthey have and talking with them after.\nA point of contention was the changes to the Trustee Board. The Board is\nre-organised with two elected students and two appointed students as\nthe Student Trustees. Furthermore, all\nof the Deputy Presidents (Education,\nWelfare, Finance & Services, Clubs &\nSocieties) will be on the Trustee Board\nas members, rather than the current\nobserver status. The other change\nwould be Court Chair no longer sitting on the Board, as Court is being\ndismantled in the proposed changes. a\npoint that was also contentious.\nThe argument that Beaumont has\nput forward is that it lessens the President\u2019s power in relation to the Deputy\nPresidents saying that at the moment\nonly he is able to sit in closed session\nmeetings and that he is the only voting member from the Sabbatical team\non the Board. He went on to say that\nhe believed it took power away from\nthe President, as he says that under\nthe current rules \u201cIf I wanted to run it\nignoring the other Sabbs I technically\ncould. At the moment the President\nhas too much power. This spreads it\namongst the Sabbs.\u201d A point raised\nabout this move is that it means the\nSabbatical team as a whole are a lot\nmore powerful, even if the President\nisn\u2019t individually more powerful. The\nCourt argues that it means that the\nSabbatical team would only need\nthree out of the other ten members of\nthe Trustee Board to vote with them\nto have a controlling majority of eight\n(the Board is proposed to be made up\nof 15 members). The Court also points\nout that the Sabbatical O\ufb03cers are\nthe most likely, and in general do, attend all the meetings, whereas the Lay\nTrustees and Student Trustees can not\nalways make it. The Court argues that\nthis makes the Sabbaticals have a lot of\nsay on the Board. The Court also noted that the President and the Deputy\nPresidents would become more powerful if they stick together when vot-ing, and could use the Trustee Board,\nwhich is the highest Board in the Union, to overturn and change decisions\nmade by Council. Beaumont argues\nthat the President can currently \u201cuse\nposition to overturn the rest of the\nSabbs\u201d and goes on to point out that\nthe Sabbatical O\ufb03cers are also elected\nby a ballot of the entire student body.\nHe also stated that there would be \ufb01ve\nSabbatical O\ufb03cers on the Board and\ntherefore a minority when compared\nto the \ufb01fteen members that are on the\nBoard in total.\nIn relation to Felix, it is no longer\nwritten in the main body of the Constitution regarding the position of\nFelix Editor, with no other Sabbatical\nO\ufb03cers except for the President being\nexplicitly mentioned. The sabbatical\nposition for the Felix Editor and the\nMedics\u2019 President are written into\nother parts of legislature such as for\nFelix the Felix Constitution, Job Contract, and Felix Policy. This caused\nalarm that the position may be under threat and made easy to remove.\nWhen asked, Beaumont said that the\nprocedure for changing whether or\nnot the positions were sabbatical or\nnot remains the same under the new\nlaws. In the two and fro, Court considered that parts of the constitution may\nbe taking away the editorial independence of Felix, meanwhile Beaumont\nsets out his reasons why his view is\nthat it remains the same.\nA new point added to the draft\nConstitution states that \u201cBringing\nthe Union into disrepute\u201d is grounds\nfor disciplinary action against those\nfound to be doing so. The Court state\nthat there is \u201ca sense of unease in allowing a blameless individual... to be\ndisciplined just because the Union has\nended up looking bad.\u201d Court later refer to how it could a\ufb00ect anyone who\nis whistleblowing and if there are any\narticles in Felix. Beaumont was questioned over this, and answered that\nit was: \u201cthe individual that did something wrong, it\u2019s not the whistleblower\nor the people reporting it that brings\nit into disrepute\u201d. The clari\ufb01cation of\nthis point will be added to the version\nthat is brought before Council.\nAnother issue was that the Court\nwill be removed with the functions\nmoved to the Trustee Board. The\nCourt stated that this \u201cmoves Court\nfunctions to the Trustee Board and\nin the case of Elections, largely to one\nindividual\u201d.\nThe general opinions set out by the\nCourt are that the restructure the Union into \u201ca di\ufb00erent sort of Union\u201d and\nstates that Council can do this but that\nit aims to \u201chighlight some key matters\nfor consideration\u201d. The reply from\nBeaumont is that it is not restructur-ing, although admitting some changes\nare occurring. The Court highlighted\nten topics that it was concerned with.\nThese included those referred to before in this article and others. These\npoints seem to be the main arguing\nground with Beaumont referring to\nsome of them as \u201cfactually inaccurate\u201d.\nThe new draft of the Constitution\nwas produced using an NUS template\ncontinued from the front page\n>>\ndocument. It has been said by lawyers\nthat it is legally \ufb01ne. However, it is\nimportant to note that this does not\nmean that they think it is the correct\nstructure: it means that it is legally\nall okay, not necessarily the best and\nmost democratic way to run the Union.\nThis article is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the Constitutional\nchanges and the discussion between\nthe Court and the President.\nCouncil is on Tuesday 30 October in\nthe Union Dining Hall. This is on the\nFirst Floor on the left. Any student is\nwelcome to attend the discussion, although only members of Council can\nvote.

    "content": "Battle star\nGalactia\nARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIn 16th century Venice, female artist\nGalactia is commissioned by the state\nto paint a wall-sized canvas to commemorate the victory of the Battle\nof Lepanto. This initiates the events\nin Scenes from an Execution, a play\noriginally written for the radio in the\n1980s but now produced for the stage\nby the National Theatre.\nBeing a woman in a politically\nmale-dominated climate, Galactia\u2019s\ndesire for self-expression crashes\nhead\ufb01rst into the requests of the art-obsessed Doge, the representative of\nthe state involved in the project.\nFiona Shaw, also known as Petunia Dursley, does a great job in \ufb01lling\nthe whole room with Galactia\u2019s presence and, occasionally, her frustrated\nmadness. Her character reminds one\nof an Emin-like \ufb01gure \u2013 allowing for\nan identi\ufb01cation with \u201cthe artist\u201d \u2013\neven though most people probably\ndon\u2019t know whether or not Tracy\nEmin is anything like Galactia.\nAs the only female character not\ncovered from neck to toe, her nonchalant liberalness contrasts with the\ncontrived nature of the masculine\npowers, echoed by the sharp-suited,\ngrey-haired and square-spectacled\nnarrator who introduces the play\n\ufb02oating, deity-like, in his square box.\nSo powerful is he, that he freezes\ntime, weaving in and out unnoticed,\ndescribing each of Galactia\u2019s scenes\nas ones from a sketchbook of her\nown execution. This creates an obvious clich\u00e9: as she de\ufb01es the state in\npainting execution in battle as it is \u2013\nblood and gore with no glori\ufb01cation\n\u2013 it is for her that the gallows begin\nto loom.\nThe dealing of gender roles in the\nplay is not overly original. The artist\nis described as promiscuous for having had children with several men including a younger, married lover. One\nof her daughters is accused of being a\nprostitute for dressing in colour while\nthe other, dressed solely in black, asks\nher mother to please the state in a bid\nto increase the reputation of female\nartists. Of course, Galactia refuses,\nand she is only spared from life-long\nimprisonment when a female critic\npatronisingly dresses up the meaning\nbehind her work as one to be interpreted in an ironic fashion.\nDespite this, it is good that the play\nis not one to lecture about morality\nand the values of feminism. Empathy is not exactly the strongest feeling produced for the character and\nfate of Galactia, as there is sense to\nwhat those advising her say (even if\nthey might say it in a somewhat sexist way), thereby creating an engaging\nlevel of tension throughout.\nAlthough by no means perfect,\nScenes from an Execution has been\nexcellently staged and its themes have\nthe ability to grip the audience and\ninstigate re\ufb02ection over the events\noccurring on stage.\nAt the National Theatre until December 9th.\nLily Le\nRumble in the jungle\nPolitical cock-ups, murder and deceit in time\nfor the American presidential elections\nWith an endless choice of world-renowned plays popping out every\nweek in Central London, one might\nwonder why one need even look at the\nsmaller theatres for entertainment.\nThe answer, is that it is often only in\no\ufb00-the-beaten-track locations that\nyou can \ufb01nd surprising little gems like\nthe one staged at Richmond\u2019s Orange\nTree Theatre, The White House Murder Case. The play is as satirical as it\nis topical, with US federal elections\ntaking place in a fortnight. The performance takes us to a time in which the\nUS is at war (surprise surprise) with\nseveral countries, and reeling from\nthe loss of 750 soldiers in a guerilla\ncon\ufb02ict in Brazil. The accident, caused\nby a monumental cock-up has to be\naccounted for by the President; all this\nonly 6 weeks before the elections!\nAs the President, played by Bruce\nAlexander, and his team of pragmatic yet heartless advisors try to come\nup with a decent explanation for the\nback\ufb01re of their operations down\nsouth, another catastrophe occurs in\nthe Oval O\ufb03ce itself: the First Lady is\nmurdered! This, however, is far from\nbeing the central drama that the storyline draws out.\nWriter, Jules Fei\ufb00er, who won a\nPulitzer Prize for his newspaper car-toons, sets it as a cynically witty story\nhappening sometime in the 2010s.\nYet, he wrote the play in the 1970s!\nThis is just one of the many ironies\nsprinkled across the script; a sarcastic\nEmilie Beauchamp\nnote that the black and white world of\nrealpolitik hasn\u2019t changed much over\nthe last half century. Director Christopher Morahan handles the recreation of the scenes fairly well within\nthe minimalist environment. The\nstage literally takes up eight square\nmetres and is smartly divided in two:\none half taken up by the political set\nof the White House, the other by two\nunfortunate surviving soldiers in the\nbackdrop of the warring Brazilian jun-gle. The scenarios are played in paral-lel, with scenes oscillating between\nthe US and Brazil, both bringing their\nhandfuls of satire. Yet, while the back\nand forth between the two locations\ngoes smoothly, the two worlds slowly\nlose their connectivity and could have\nbeen tied up more wittily in the end.\nOnly a minor point for discontent.\nThe intimate 170 seat Orange Tree\nTheatre, which bills itself as a patron\nfor new and \u2018undiscovered\u2019 writing\nfrom the UK and abroad, lends itself\nperfectly to resuscitate Fei\ufb00er\u2019s work.\nFor a bit more than a tenner (or \u00a35 if\nyou\u2019re under 26) you get to laugh for\ntwo hours and enjoy a spotless crew of\nactors in a pleasantly di\ufb00erent ambiance from the impersonal West End\ngigs. This is recommended to get a\ngood taste of the full portfolio of entertainment London has to o\ufb00er.\nAt the Orange Tree Theatre until November 10th. Tickets \u00a35-\u00a322.\nWriter\nWriter\nMan falls for thumb-tac on chair gambit\nCompost heap sprouts heads\nFor more visit grannynipslip.org\nJames Alper, Robert Balderrama \u00a9 Robert Day\nBruce Alexander (President Hale) \u00a9 Robert Day\nFRIDAY 26 OCTOBER 27\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 26 OCTOBER\n8\nrom 15 \u2013 17th February\n2013, you will see numerous important looking\npeople in black suits and\nformal dresses run around\nour campus. And you may wonder\nwhat it could be causing this invasion\nof foreigners. Let me give you some\ninsight into the big things happening\nat Imperial.\nThe very large university level Model United Nations (MUN) conference\nwill be hosted at Imperial College in\nFebruary 2013. For three days, delegates from universities from all\naround the UK and abroad will debate\npressing international issues on the\nUN agenda, representing their \u201chome\ncountry\u201d, which they may have never\nlived in. but whose politics they have\nextensively researched during the last\nweeks. So what exactly is MUN? It is\na gathering of some of the best and\nbrightest debaters, speakers and inspirational \ufb01gures in the global student community who swap identity\nfor 3 days stepping in the footsteps of/\ntaking on the role of national representatives to the UN. It is astonishing\nhow realistic these simulated UN conferences often turn out to be, portraying the complexities of international\npolicy formation (change). After an\nMUN weekend full of drafting resolu-tions, sending secret notes to the collaborators you managed to convince\nthe night before in the hotel lounge to\njoin your policy just before going for\nthe International Party Night, lengthy\nvoting procedures, little sleep (due to\ndrafting papers or dazzling parties?)\nand making new lifelong friendships\nwith people from all around the world,\nyou feel more than overwhelmed.\nIf you have done it once, you want\nto do it again. How United Nations\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-Moon\nputs it, MUN is an \u201cexercise that gives\nyou a full taste of\nthe complexity\nof international relations\n\u2013 the intricacies of negotiating\na m o n g\nd i v e r s e\npeoples\na n d\np e r -spec-tives,\nt h e\nc h a l -The conference will be better attended than this...\nLIMUN comes to Imperial\nFranca Hoffmann discusses politicians-to-be coming to campus\nlenges of achieving consensus, the patience required to win progress\u201d.\nLike is the case with so many other\nsocial phenomena, Model United Nations started growing exponentially\nthe moment it attracted the student\ncommunity. With more than 1500\ndelegates, 25 committees negotiating in 3 di\ufb00erent languages, the London International Model United Nations Conference (LIMUN) 2013 has\ngrown into the biggest university level\nMUN conference in Europe, The o\ufb03cial launch of LIMUN 2013, held on\nThursday, Oct 18th at HULT International Business School, was attended\nby representatives of several higher\neducation institutions in London,\nthe British UN Association as well as\nvarious MUN societies from around\nthe UK and abroad. The presentation\nof the LIMUN 2013 secretariat was\nfollowed by a food and drink recep-tion, with the beer sponsored by the\nEmbassies of Dominican Republic,\nTrinidad and Tobago.\nAmanda Sun, Under-SecretaryGeneral for Logistics, heading a team\nof volunteers to organise the necessary provisions for the conference, explains what is special about LIMUN\n2013:\n\u201cThis year the topic of the conference will be the Millennium Development Goals. We want to bring a\nfocus to what we as a conference are\ntrying to raise awareness on, and the\nMDGs address the most pressing issues facing our world today.\u201d These\nare undoubtedly\nbig problems\nthat politicians\nand governments around\nthe world worry about, but\nwhat does Imperial has to do\nw i t h\nF\nMUN?\nPhilippe Rival, President of the\nImperial College MUN society (IC-MUN) tells us that LIMUN and ICMUN have enjoyed a very tight relationship for many years. \u201cWe are\namongst the biggest delegations who\nattend LIMUN. We have also sent a\nminimum of one delegate per year to\nchair and very often our delegates win\nseveral awards across a wide variety of\ncommittees.\u201d\nNow, if you say \u2018Well, this sounds\nall amazing, but I am an engineer,\nhow should I survive in the middle\nof all these politicians and lawyers?\u2019\nNeedless to say that as a scientist attending an MUN conference, you are\nsomething special. When asked about\nyour subject, people tend to look at\nyou with this glint of surprise thinking \u2018What the hell is he doing here?\u2019.\nAnd yes, why on earth should scientists be interested in MUN? This is\none of Philippe\u2019s favourite questions.\n\u201cI can make it even simpler : Why do\nwe do MUN at Imperial ? We don\u2019t\nhave student in PPE, literature,\nlaw or psychology. The best way\nto fully understand why it is that\nMUN works at Imperial has to do\nwith what being a scientist actually\nentails. Scientists, engineers, doctors,\nall share the common trait that their\nwork revolves around \ufb01nding a solution to a problem by using knowledge\nand reasoning they have accumulated\nover experience and training. People\nfrom Imperial know what it means\nto go and \ufb01nd an answer to a prob-lem, and they even go to such lengths\nas giving up their night and sleep on\nsuch problems.\u201d\nConferences are an unforgettable\nexperience, and if you feel you are\nnot the next Churchill to come, don\u2019t\nworry, everybody had their \ufb01rst MUN\nexperience one day. Amanda recalls\nhow she \ufb01rst got involved with the\nworldwide MUN movement. \u201cSometimes things happen when you least\nexpect them - my high school team\nneeded a member, at the last minute,\nto replace one who could not attend\nHarvard MUN in Boston and my best\nfriend pulled me in. It turned out to\nbe the best split-second decision I\u2019d\never made, leading me to where I am\ntoday.\u201d\nOur very own ICMUN president\nPhilippe Rival \ufb01rst started MUN in\nhigh-school when he moved back to\nFrance from Australia, but what inspired his \ufb01rst true MUN experience\nhappened at the Paris Conference\nof 2010. Philippe was representing\nUganda and won the Best Delegate\nAward. This particular conference was\nheld in the actual building of the UNESCO, in Paris. He received his Award\nin front of 2000 people and 195 state\n\ufb02ags, on the UNESCO stage, in front\nof a handful of actual UN representa-tives. \u201cThere is nothing more motivating than to get that feeling \ufb01rst hand.\u201d\nAmanda adds that she was blown\naway by how passionate LIMUN delegates are, and by their depth of knowledge in global and regional issues.\nBesides an excellent opportunity to\nbuild relationships across borders of\nbackground, culture and nationality,\nand inevitably \u2013 let\u2019s be realistic \u2013 a lot\nof work, there is a very important life\nskill to learn: when you play with the\nrules, you come up with better ways to\nmanipulate or go around them.\nIf you are interested in being part of\nsomething great, applications for LIMUN 2013 are still open.\nA last word from the ICMUN presi-dent: \u201cOne thing is sure, the MUN future is bright at Imperial.\u201d\n\n"
