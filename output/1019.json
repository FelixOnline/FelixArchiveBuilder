The first, Sir Ronald\nOxburgh, replies overleaf. But the Pro\nRector had more to say...\nBy Michael Lud lam Most of us don't have a good excuse to visit\nwhat is known as 'the Rector's Suite'. Nor had\nI, until I was invited by the Pro Rector, Alan\nSwanson. As I wait to be seen I am passed by\nBig Suits and Power Dresses. Suddenly a man\nintroduces himself as the Pro Rector. Where\nis the big suit? Where are those power\nshoulders? He's in 'academic clothes'! He\nlooks like one of my lecturers!\nThe man is Professor Swanson, formally\nof Mechanical Engineering, who last year\nbecame the first Pro Rector for Educational\nQuality. We talk in his office, quickly getting\naround to the number of lecture theatres.\nThey would build more, he says, but they\ncannot get funding for them. Departments are\ngoing to have to start sharing lecture theatres\nbecause for long periods of time they lie\nempty.\n>\u2022 Departments are fond of their autonomy. Is\nthat going to change especially concerning lecture\ntheatres?\nNo department owns their building, strictly\nthe governing body owns all the buildings.\nDepartment autonomy has never been\nuniversal. The management school, for as\nlong as anyone can\nV The problem I have, is that when\nyou do decide to build\naccommodation like Southside it\nshould be built to last.\nSouthside was regarded as\na good example of a Fifties hall\nof residence when, for example,\nmost students were gentlemen\nand would get properly dressed\nin the morning and come down\nand eat a proper cooked -breakfast served in a dining room. The idea\nthat students would do their cooking for\nthemselves just wasn't around. Times have\nchanged, and I suppose we could demolish\nSouthside and start again but the costs are\nawe-inspiring. The basic structure, I am told,\nis good. Someone has to see how we can adapt\nit to make it more in tune with today's needs.\nWe could always make bigger common rooms\nand bigger kitchens at the expense of\nremoving some bedrooms but the one thing\nthat we desperately need is more places for\nstudents to sleep.\nThe difference in accommodation between\nLinstead and Evelyn Gardens is huge. Are there\nany plans to bring\nremember, has shared \"ft j gsi ff lp lv CaUYlOU MUSt UOt. al1 the hal ht0 th the mechanical engineering building with\nthe Me ch.Eng. department. Bio chemistry has never\nhad enough [theatres],\nthey have always used\none of the ones in the Sherfield building...The\nboundaries are going to be crossed more in\nthe future.\n>- Tell me about the accommodation problem.\nI don't think anybody in the college would\ndispute the general drift of what you are\nsaying here (pointing to my Christmas list) but it\nis quite simply a case of money. I walked\naround the halls with the Director of Estates\nand the Director of Finance recently. You don't have to be an expert to see there are lots\nof things that need doing. [To get to] the sort\nof state that most of us would be happy with -without being luxurious - you are into many\nmillions, maybe even tens of millions.\nallow the price of our\naccommodation to drift\nupwards...\"\nsame standard?\nWe want to make\nit all better.\nLinstead is one of\nthe most recent\nand therefore you\nwould expect it to\nbe one of the soundest and most nearly in\ntune with modern-day thinking, whereas so\nmany of the others, in Evelyn Gardens\nparticularly, are adaptations of Victorian\nhouses, with all the associated limitations.\nThat was the product of the time when it was\nprohibitively expensive to build new\nbuildings. It does look now that that was too\nmuch of a cut price job. Some of the wiring\nand plumbing still looks Victorian.\n>\u2022 When college does things it tends to do them on\nthe cheap, which does not solve the problem.\nIt is a problem that every householder has:\nspend more money today and get a better job\nthat will last longer. But when you are\nAcademic Clothing: Pro Rector Alan Swanson\nrunning a big organisation, particularly when\nit is basically taxpayer funded or charitable or\nboth, you have also to consider - is it better to\nspend the money now and hope that it will\nlast longer or spend not quite so much now\nand redo it sooner? ...When you charge\nyourself interest on the money you are\nspending now it can sometimes actually be\ncheaper to do a second rate job and redo it\nfrequently. As an engineer I am appa led, and\nas a householder I don't like it, but as\nsomeone who has got some sort of hand in\nmanaging the money one has to think about\nthat. I would like our students to live in\naccommodation - I wouldn't quite say luxury\nhotels - where the quality of what is done is\nabove any reasonable criticism. But all that\ncosts money and students' funds are limited\nand we simply cannot, must not, allow the\nprice of our accommodation to drift upwards\nmore than it has done.\nV In my Christmas list I mentioned that I would\nlike to see more exchange programmes. Are there\nany plans for an extension?\nWe have to satisfy certain regulations from\nthe University of London and sometimes an\naccredited body. We do have to make sure\nthat this year [abroad] is genuinely\nequivalent. We have chosen to have fewer, but\ngenuinely enjoyable, exchange programmes.\n^ The impression I have got from some\ndepartments is that they are not very keen to do\nexchanges.\nOh that's not true at all. If one of the heads of\ndepartment puts up a case that looks\nreasonable it will get through quickly. The\nbottom line is the academic time that has to\nbe invested by the department in getting to\nknow another place.\nMM FELIX B3FBB95\n\n"

Having\nbeen inundated with telephone\nenquiries last year, Sir Eric Ash,\nacting head of the S LC and\nformer Rector of Imperial\nCollege, has announced plans to\nanswer queries by email.\nFigures from the S LC have\nshown that last December, its 20\ntele ph on is ts were flooded by\n60000 callers. To reduce the\nShrink\n'Shrink'filmed their latest video at\nImperial on Wednesday, writes\nRachel Walters\nMore well known in their other\nguise as the tribute band 'Peroxide\nBlondie', the group spent the day\nrecording around the local area, as\nwell as in the STOIC studio.\nThe band rallied together old\nfriends from the comedy store players\nGreg Proops, Harry Hill, Richard\nVranch and Tony Hawkes to record\nthe song. They say \"I think I'm Jesus\" is a parody of megalomania,\nfeaturing the comedians dressed as\nvicars, with firemen, surgeons and a judge portrayed as being power-crazy.\nSpeaking to FELIX, Ian from\nShrink said that they were running a really tight budget and were pleased\nto be able to take advantage of\nSTOIC's facilities. \"The studio is\nperfect because it's so small,\" he\nexplained.\nSTOIC have said that they will\nbe showing interviews with the\ncomedians the week after next, and\nthat the video itself is due to come\nout at the end of the year.\n(GBH? continued from page one)\nthe incident and not to travel\nmore than one mile from the\ncollege itself.\nFollowing this and a lesser\nassault before Christmas of which\ncollege security were also aware,\nthe girlfriend returned to Japan\nto obtain treatment for kidney\ndamage and to receive laser\nnumber of callers Sir Eric has\nturned to the internet: \"It seems\nto me that email is a much better\nway of making standard\nenquiries.\"\nInternet access will be\nprovided by the Joint Academic\nNetwork which connects the\ncountry's higher educational\nestablishments together.

In a clash with\nTony Benn, speaking at the same\ntime on the other side of college,\nhe came off by far the worst even\nthough he described his more\npopular opponent as a 'has been'.\nThe relatively unknown cabinet minister was greeted on\narrival by Sir Ronald Oxburgh,\nRector of Imperial College, but\nfaced a more frosty response\nfrom the few Conservative\nStudents who showed up. The\ngroup, who had fervently\nwelcomed Eurosceptics, disagreed repeatedly with the 'very\nstrong European' views of the\nCabinet Minister. He dismissed\nthe Conservative Eurosceptics as\nbeing 'a very small minority of\nMPs', but blamed current\nproblems on the instability of a Government with a small\nparliamentary majority. The\nCabinet Minister emphasised\nhow the whole Cabinet had\nagreed that Britain should stay\nin the European Union, and\n'fight for British interests'.\nThe immediate prospects of\nthe Conservative party for\nimproved public support are not\nvery good, according to David\nHunt. In a veiled attack on the\nchancellor, he placed the blame\nsquarely on his party's decision\nto raise taxes, a step which he\ndescribed as being the most\n'un conservative' action possible.\nThough in an allusion to future\ntax cuts, Mr Hunt promised\nthose present that the current\nunpopularity 'would not last'.\nTurning to the subject of\nhealth, he pre-emp ted the\ndecision by the Higher\nEducation Funding Council of\nEngland and the Department of\nHealth, in clearly suggesting that\nthe \u00a360 million new Basic\nMedical Science building would\nbe built. Encouraging scientists\nto speak to the media, David\nHunt also hinted how medical\nscience 'is going to become more\nand more a feature here at\nImperial'.\nFELIX03 FEB95 "

There may be others\nthat haven'ta programme like ours. If a university has a lot of exchange programmes\nthen I would certainly want to ask what\npreparation had gone into them. It is\nimportant that the exchange programmes on\noffer are properly prepared so that students\nhave a good year there... In Mech. Eng. for\nexample, this is the first year that we sent a few students to North America, where you\nmight feel the difficulties are few because\nthere is no language barrier. But in fact the\ndifference in ethos, in the way in that the\ncourse is conducted, was as least as great -which is a warning to us.\n>\u2022 Imperial College catering always seems to\nthink that we are here for them and not the other\nway round.\nYou may be right in that that is the image\nthey project. A lot of people are unhappy with\nvarious aspects of catering. I have been in this\njob for only a few months so in a sense until\nrecently I have been a customer and have\nobserved some of its\nlimitations. We have\nhad a fairly quick\nsuccession of catering\nmanagers. A new one\nis due to start soon.\nThe main misunderstanding in catering\nis that it is not actively clear who it should\nreport to. It used to be the domestic bursar,\nbut for many years, for various reasons, it\nhasn't. When the new manager starts, the\nRector has decided that he should receive\ngeneral direction on policy from a body which\nwill be like a company board - with me as the\nchairman - which signals the Rector's intention of a serious intent [umm m?] to\nwhich to direct the policy of catering, with a strong eye for the customers.\n>- The biggest complaint I have of catering is the\nprice of things, especially those in Southside shop.\nThat is interesting, because they tell me beer\nin college is significantly cheaper than local\npubs.\nThe Writer Replies\nWhen I wrote my list I never thought that I would receive a reply. Maybe I have got too\nused to people not listening to my complaints,\nespecially in this college. Or maybe too many\npeople around me had given up without even\ntrying. Everybody loves to w hinge; I love to\nw hinge it is good to complain when things\nare wrong. But I think that we have all been\nprogrammed to believe that challenging things\ndoes not work. We all went to a school where\n)\u2022 It is, but basic items in the shop are as\nexpensive as those in shops in South Kensington.\nHmmm, I do not know why.\n)\u2022 / believe that the shops exist rent free and that\ncollege pays their bills.\nI agree with you on the face of it - that should\nmean lower prices. If Sainsbury's can for their\nreasons sell more cheaply than the corner\nshop then I don't see why the college shop\nshouldn't sell more cheaply than the corner\nshop too for a different set of reasons.\n)\u2022 Why does catering still make a loss?\nI think you will find in many universities that\ncatering just about breaks even. The general\nidea is that food makes a loss and beer makes\na profit and they cancel each other out. And it\njust about balances.\n>\u2022 But in Linstead each of the meals costs \u00a33 and\nsome of them are inedible.\nAnd you would expect it to be at least\nedible. I can think of no excuse for inedible\nmeals. I am tempted to say that is part of the\nnew catering manager's job. I do know as I have been here a long\ntime that people have\nbeing wringing hands\nover catering.\nCatering staff are not\nnecessarily happy\nbecause of this and I am little surprised that they don't smile all\nthe time. People are not simple machines that\nyou can wind up and run.\n>\u2022 What is the Rector doing to prevent student\nunion 'reforms'?\nWe live in a democracy and we can't change the government just because you and I don't like it. Well, what can you do? Rectors\ntogether sometimes write strongly worded\nstatements. The Rector is a member of the\n'Russell Group', whatever exactly that is, but\nthey do things such as having the Secretary of\nState round for dinner, and it is possible that\npressure like that is more useful than public\nstatements. I see normal pillars of\nrespectability by no means foaming at the\nmouth, left-wing revolutionaries condemning\nthis government's lunacy in student union socalled 'reforms'.\nwe could not change things, where we were\ntold that we were not mature enough to make\ndecisions, and in one way or another that\nseems to carry on with us. This college, along\nwith just about every other college in Britain at\nthe moment, has a problem with student\napathy. Maybe there isn't much out there left\nto fight for? But is everything perfect? Are you\ncompletely happy with everything that goes on\nin this college? Hadn't you better start doing\nsomething about it? I meet people every day\nwho would rather bottle it all up than speak\nThe Rector's Reply! Greenland\n9th January 1995\nDear Michael,\nI am delighted to learn that you still\nbelieve in me. I am told that in some circles\nthe political correctness of parents' even\ndiscussing my existence with their children\nis in debate.\nNever the less here I am. I was very\npleased to receive your Christmas list.\nUnfortunately in these days of long lead\ntimes it was a little too late for me to slide\nall your requests into your stocking. I have\nto say, however, that for the most part it\nwas a very reasonable list and includes\nmany of the presents I'd have been inclined\nto leave you had I been left to think it up\nfor myself.\nYou have to remember though that\nI'm still working at becoming a magician.\nThis means that although I may be able to\nslip in a few late delivery presents during\nthe year, others may have to wait for next\nChristmas or the year after. You may be\ninterested to know that I had a similar\nletter from the Rector. I may even be able to\nsatisfy you both.\nHappy New Year,\nSanta.\nIt is rather interesting seeing all these\npresumed conservative voters, saying that this\nConservative government has got it all wrong.\nBut when you have a government that\ngoverns by obsession, which is what we are\nnow facing, they don't often listen... The\nanswer is, of course, voting for a different\ngovernment and hoping that they will be\nmore enlightened, but I wouldn't like to\nguarantee that they would.\n)\u2022 Finally, what are you hoping to achieve in your\nnew job?\n[Laughter] I am not expecting to solve\nall the college's problems, but there are two\nmain things. One is that universities in\ngeneral need to be much more aware and\nunderstanding of the educational process; the\nother is to work out what happens to students\noutside their departments in the college\ncommunity. There are always going to be\nthese tensions, basically because we don't print money and therefore we have to make\nthe money we have go as far as possible. 5\nout. You say that it won't make a difference, or\nthat it will never come to anything. I disagree -I didn't think that my complaints would be\ntaken seriously but they were.\nOK, so you have heard this all before.\nGood rousing moral stuff isn't it? 'Speak out\nand do something' sounds like the careers\noffice, but has anyone actually bothered?\nShouldn't someone start? A great man said\n\"for evil to triumph it is only necessary for\ngood men to do nothing.\"\nMichael Lud la m\"I can think of no excuse\nfor inedible meals...\"\n03FeB9 S FELIX Hi "

    "content": "Standby\nmoist\naway down south\nA box in the Royal Albert Hall is a strange, if rather cool, place from\nwhich to watch a rock concert.\nOrnate surroundings (well this is our\ngraduation hall), sculpted ceilings,\ntiers of seats below you, a circular\npit of rockers and retro s standing in\nfront of them and a bunch of scruffy\nAmericans on stage - I'm sure\nthere's a contradiction in there\nsomewhere. Still, support band\nDillon Fence served themselves\nwell, delivering faithful, perfectly\nharmon is ed snippets from their new\nalbum and garnering a positive\nreaction.\nBut it was the black crowes\nthat everyone was here to see and\nthe punters were not left\ndisappointed. The Crowes, as\nthey're affectionately known to their\nfans, have made an art form out of\nnicking the best traits from old\nbands, melding them, adding their\nown little idiosyncrasies and selling\nit. Not exactly iconoclastic, and\nsome might call it plagiarism, but\nwhen they end up sounding way\nbetter than all of the bands they are\nsupposed to be copying, quite\nfrankly, who cares?\nTonight's set gathers in\nhighlights from all three of their\nalbums. 'Jealous Again' and 'Twice\nAs Hard' showcase the best\nattributes of the debut, 'Shake Your\nMoneymaker' - simple but skillfully\ncrafted songs that are perfectly\nsuited to this sort of forum. The likes\nof 'Hotel Illness' and 'Sometimes\nSalvation' do the same job for\n1992's 'Southern Harmony...'.\nMeanwhile, the percussive and\ngroove elements of the recent\n'Amorica' are borne out in 'A Conspiracy' and 'High Head Blues'.\nThe crowd lapped it up and\nwith a coup de grace of 'Remedy'\nthe Crowes left the stage to a roaring ovation. With a reaction like\nthat it might not be long before they\nhave attained the same status as\nthe bands that they so lovingly\nembrace.\nWith heavy MTV rotation, a top\n40 single in 'Push' and a pretty boy\nsinger in David Usher, you'd be\nforgiven for being suspicious of\nCanadian band moist. Take a listen\nto their debut album 'Silver' and\nthey don't really put up a strong\ncase for their defence with a bunch\nof woefully produced, quasi-rock\nsongs that don't justify (or would\nexplain, depending on your point of\nview) a major label deal. See them\nlive, on the other hand, and it's a slightly different story, with their\nclaim to writing songs with \"live\nperformances in mind\" becoming a reality.\nQuite simply, singer David\nUsher and guitarist Mark Makowy\nare mad, but then you'd know that\nif you've ever seen MTV. Usher has\napparently broken everything on\nstage during Moist's short career\nand tonight he succeeded in turfing\nkeyboardist Kevin Young off the\nCamden Palace stage (while he was\nstill playing keyboards, of course).\nAs for Makowy, well if you'd seen\nthe ridiculous and seemingly infinite\nrange of facial contortions he pulled\nwhilst playing guitar then you'd know that Canada has finally found\nits answer to Phil Cool. At least if\nthe band don't make it he can make\na living in the circus..\nObviously, these factors alone\ncould not make for an enjoyable gig\nbut un surprisingly the music also\ntook on a somewhat more exciting\nvibe. Songs like 'Kill For You' came\nacross with a considerably harder\nedge and got a lot closer to meeting\ntheir would-be \"Pat Boone-meets Kiss\" aspirations than on disc. Not\nquite as wet as you thought...\nextreme started their career\nplaying annoying, but good, pop\nrock music for little girls. However in\n1992 they decided to go all serious\non us with the release of their\n'ambitious and controversial'\nalbum, 'Three Sides To Every Story'.\nThis was a commercial flop as the\nlittle girls, myself included, weren't ready for such a progression. So\nExtreme are back to try again.\nTheir new album, waiting for\nthe punchline, takes ages to get into\n-longer than the five days I 've had\nto hear it- but it improves on\nrepeated plays. Like 'Three Sides',\nthe music is more progressive than\npop. Fans of prog gie bands like\nDream Theater will love this. A couple of tracks, (eg 'Shadow-boxing') are more instantly\naccessible and remind me of the\nextreme of old when I was thirteen\nand fancied Nuno Bettencourt!\nUnfortunately this album suffers\nfrom extreme length [groan -ed.]\nand pretentiousness.

But it doesn't have to be like this.\nMatt told me his story about the depression\nthat nearly ruined his PhD.\n\"Things were going from bad to worse.\nI just didn't think my work was good enough\nand didn't think I could make it through this\ndegree. For months I was having difficulty\nmotivating myself or believing my own ideas,\nI couldn't sleep.

I really\nwas at my wits' end when I went to see a councillor at\ncollege. But it really helped.\nI just realised that I was\npunishing myself and that I should have more confidence. Nothing to do\nwith my work has changed; it's my attitude to\nit that matters. I just believe in myself more.\"\nFor Matt it was just a question of\nfinding someone completely independent of\nhis friends and family whom he could confide\nin. This is a common problem in depression.\nYou feel as if your problems are not even\nworth an airing, or you just don't want to\nburden friends and family with another tale of\nwoe. This is where counselling can help.\nHowever, although the public perception of\ncounselling is becoming more positive as\npeople learn more about different therapies,\nthe prevailing view is still that you should\n\" pull your socks up and pull yourself\ntogether.\" But prejudice against therapy is\nmore complicated than this. \" A lot of people\ndon't want it in their notes\", says Dr Weinreb. \"It may affect your medical\ninsurance.

Although it lifts patients' moods - or\nnumbs them - it really has no medical effect\non the cause of depression, which is not\ncompletely understood. Recent work has\nsuggested that manic depressive conditions\nare heritable; the extent of the environment's influence remains contentious.\nI 've learned a lot about depression while\nresearching this article.

    "content": "Clued Up\nA View f t*o mIke Boundary The annual Midterm Parliamentary cricket match is very\nmuch an atypical affair. It is\ncontested in the dark, cold and\nbitter winter months, between\nthe Government XI and\nOpposition XI. Your sketch\nwriter was there, privy to the\ndrama that unfolded. The members stand was packed to\ncapacity with a proliferate of\npro ls. The aristocrats, refined and\nsplendid, sat patiently and aloof\nin the Lords' pa villi on. First, and most definitely\nforemost, came the majestic\nsplendour of Madame Umpire.\nShe seemed to float effortlessly\non an air of puritan authority.\nSublime. Her downy rump\nsettled at the Nursery End, aka\nthe Member's stand.\nThen, to a stupendous roar\nand much waving of score cards,\nemerged the contesting members.\nFirstly, the Government XI, led\nby captain J. 'straight bat' Major\nand his ample lieutenant,\nK. Clarke. The business thus far\nhad proven to be 'most\ndisagreeable'. The Tory willow mi esters had procured a first innings disaster. Weak\nleadership from the captain, and\na middle order collapse due to\nbitter in fighting, further\namplified by the deft\nperformance of the Opposition\nXI in the field, had left the\nGovernment XI stumped.\nNext, the Opposition captain Tony 'AB' Blair took the\nfield, followed by vice captain\nJ. 'Heffer' Prescott. They promptly took guard from\nMadame Umpire, and awaited the\ncrafty ball play known as a Tory\nbacklash.\nCaptain Major set his field\nthus: At 'silly point', sledging\nEuro-tripe, was Teressa Gorman.\nAt no middle wicket stood David\nMellor, paying no attention to the\non field action, but instead\ncarefully stage managing a press\nconference. Up in the company\nsponsored hospitality boxes sat\nthe pampered bot ty of J. Aitken,\nwho was absolutely not accepting\nbribes to table motions in the\nMembers stand\nThe two batsmen played\nwith a consummate ease. AB drove ample boundaries against\nthe assorted go og lies and wrong\n'uns, thrown by the Government\nattack. Not even the old 'Clause\n4' delivery could scuttle this lad.\nIn a fit of euphoria, the 'Heffer'\nwas seen to make strange\ngesticulations at the fielding side.\nWhen asked later what he meant\nby this, he said he was merely\ntrying to illustrate 'that it was all\nin the wrist'.\nAll-in-all, the Opposition\nXI creamed the Government's tepid attack, easily winning the\nfixture. However, all were agreed\nthat the up and coming 'General\nElection' match was of far greater\nimportance. In this, the\nGovernment XI had a40 series\nlead. But, unless the green shoots\nof political recovery burst\nthrough the worn and dusty Tory\nwicket, and soon, the lead might\nwell be reduced to 4-1.\nAdvocatus\nFrater Fia m writes The muse which has decided to\nhold your good, dear Frater in his\nendless s tangles this week is the\nrather bizarre paradoxical dual\nent it iy of the genius and the fool.\nIn a somewhat unusual\nseries of electro-correspondences,\nan acquaintance of mine chose to\nlet me be aware that my in spira tor is one who attracted the fool and\nthe genius with equal measure.\nThus one asks - are the two ideals\nlike one another, or does there\nexist a difference betwixt them.\nOrdinarily this question calls\nfor little thought, but it's become\nthe most pressing concern, for\nC.C.

It is a devilish little dilemma for which\neasy solutions do not appear. All\nvibrant genii can be branded as\nimbeciles in a single stroke, and\nlifted back to greatness and fame\nin the next.\nNow more than ever, when\nall idolatry is media enhanced, the\nlove for a celebrity depends on the\nlength of news reports about him.\nOutrageous actions lead to instant\nfame and instant infamy. Looking\nunderneath this glamour, this\nsuperficiality, one finds nothing.\nAlthough these ramblings\nlook to be lacking in intellectual\nlight, there is a greater motive here\nof which I cannot mention aloud.\nWhether or not anyone can even\nhope to receive the title of a genius\nin this random age, there is no\nmajor excuse for failing to try. Even\nif one's actions brand one a fool,\nnever let that be an obstacle.\n\u2022k What is this all really about, you\nmay be asking yourselves. Has\nyour good Frater slipped beyond\nthe bounds of comprehensibility for\ngood, or is there a hidden agenda\nto his seemingly confused\nutterances. Well, is it right that I should answer such a question or\nnot? It would seem however that\nthe nature of this column tends\ntowards an emulation of the topic\ntoday under discussion. Is your\nFrater a genius, or is he but a fool?\nHe tends to choose the latter.\nBeing a fool has many advantages;\nthe simplicity of the fool's world\nallows him to reveal hidden truths\nwithout even realising it. The\nseemingly unstructured nature of\nhis actions can confound the devil\nhimself, and have allowed the poor\nfool to escape many an hazardous\noccasion. But within this simplicity,\nthis spreading entropy, there is the\nlight of truth that is only damaged\nby the oppressive thoughts of the\ngenius. Give up, I say, and become\nthe simpleton of the first, initial\ntimes. The Fool is Zero, the first of\nthe trumps. He is beneath them all,\nand master of them all. He is the\nfirst and the last, and he remains\nfor ever; as do I, your good and\nconfounded Frater. After Confused\nRamblings On Senseless Topics I Call Up Sanity. Is that it?\nU FELIX03 F GB9 S "

The 1st team, under\nAdam Waddington, were clear\nwinners of division 1 and will be\njoined this term by the 2nd team\nwho convincingly won the second\ndivision. Andrew Harrower led\nthe 3rd team to the division 3\ntitle, aided by some good performances from Regis Gontier late\nin the season. The 4th team just\nmissed promotion to division 2,\nfinishing third-clearly ahead of\nthe fourth placed team.

K CH managed a single goal\nin reply, but the result was never\nin doubt.\nICAFC IVvs Kings IV\nAnother victory for the resurgent\nfourths, this time away to Kings\nat Berrylands. Playing with the\nwind in the first forty-five\nminutes, IC pressed forward but\nwere unable to score. However, a piece of eccentric Grobelar-style\ngoal-keeping and good work by\nRoss set up Chris Collison for a well taken goal. IC then held on\nfor the remaining forty minutes,\nwith solid performances from the\nback four and keeper Dominic.\nThe midfield also performed well,\ndriving their centre-forward to a near nervous breakdown on the\ntrain back to Waterloo.\nThanks to all who took part -particularly Ross (navigation &\nMM FELIX03 FEB95 goals), Ian and Euan (psycho logi cal warfare).

This\nenables us to progress to the next\nstage of the championships, to be\nheld in Liverpool on the 27th Feb\n1995.\nSpecial efforts by Harry 'The\nHitman' Hearns and Theo\nPaptheodosou, the Greek\ninternational forward, ensured\nthe win with three goals and\nassists between them.\nHockey\nIC Ladies 2nd vs Wye College\nThe final score did not reflect the\nbalance of the play.

    "content": "Incoming\nThe NUS debate rages on...The Real Story... OpSoc Apologises\nEeferendum?\nDear Owain,\nI am writing in support of L. Grogan's letter in last weeks FELIX\n(No. 1018). Whilst on holiday in\nCrete last summer, my friend and I went to visit the Palace of Knossos.\nStudent rates were advertised and\nshe, being a member of the NUS,\npaid them. However, although I produced my ICU card, I was\ndenied this concession.\nOn the related subject of\naffiliation with ULU, the fact that\nbeing a member of ICU does not\nallow the use of Senate House\nLibrary is absurd. For people like\nmyself who do not live in the South\nKensington area, especially those\nin Intercolligate halls, it would be\nmuch more convenient to use ULU\nfacilities.\nPerhaps an IC referendum on\nULU and NUS membership is in\norder? Imperial College has got to\nrealise that London, and indeed the\nworld, is bigger than South\nKensington.\nYours,\nN. Denvar\nChem Eng 3\nPoor Profile\nDear Owain,\nThe article on the Christian Union\nexpedition to Africa was a poor\nprofile of what really happened.\nSadly, it does not mirror the sense\nof love that each of us, having\nbeen on the trip, have for the\nBurkinabe people. Being a Christian for only four months\n(Steve and lain - all their lives) I was 'new' to a lot of what happened. The Africans who heard the\ngospel for the first time were\namazed and many came to Christ,\nmany ill villagers we prayed for\nbecame well, a lunatic bound in\nchain became sane and the\nBurkinabe Christians we worked\nwith were encouraged by our help\nand witness.\nThe full time missionaries in\nBurkina Faso were learning the\nculture and languages of the\nAfricans themselves. Even dressing\nin Burkinabe clothes and living in\nmud huts; so they became as they\nwere and sensitive to their back-ground. Burkinabe Christians\nworked with Christians from the\nWest. In fact their teamwork\nshowed they complemented one\nanother.\nBurkinabe, Tuareg and Nomadic\ntribes were very welcome to our\ntalks with them about Jesus Christ;\nhow He died for our sins and came\nback to life in order that we can\nhave relationship with God. By\ncontrast, in campus conveying any\nreligious belief is difficult.\nChristianity offers something very\nspecial for everyone - from the\nilliterate Muslim in Burkina to the\nstudent enjoying one's pint in the\nUnion bar to the intellectual\nCommunist. Christianity offers a magnified friendship. Friendship is\nimportant but to grasp that\nfriendship can be had with one's Creator is an awesome opportunity. Given time we'll all settle\ndown and perhaps - if we're lucky\nor not - have children. Hopefully\nwe might have something more\ninteresting to tell them than getting\ngutted every day at the union or\nfreaking all the girls/boys out by\nsavage Imperial Sex drives at the\nnightclubs. A case of deja-vu.\nAll in all there was so much\n'wealth' and insight gained on the\ntrip to Africa. Now I just want to\nbecome involved full time in\nmissionary work. On reply to a person I hadn't spoken to in nine\nyears informing her that I was a Christian said this:\n\"I am so glad that at last you\nfeel as happy as you do - everyone\nis entitled to experience God's amazing love and yet some people\nnever do\"\nThe Christian Union [meets in]\nRm 308, Huxley building. 6.30pm, Every Thursday.\nPeter Lo\nMech Eng II\nNUS letter\nDear Felix,\nConcerning Michael Ingram's article 'RCS to vote on NUS' in last\nweek's FELIX I would like to point\nout the following facts:\nRecent investigations have given\nthat it would cost ICU between\n\u00a325000 and \u00a330000 to join NUS,\nwhich is significantly less than\nassumed earlier, (i.e. the \u00a340000\nfigure which you quoted). As you\nsaid, we would also save a significant amount on alcohol and\ncatering, and, considering the fact\nthat NUS also offer free legal\nadvice, we might end up gaining by\njoining. As L. Grogan pointed out\nin his letter, there are also the\nbenefits for individual students to\nby considered...\nThere's the classical counter-argument. It has almost become ac liche:\"... ICU's trend of remaining\napolitical and hostile to affiliation\nwith any politically active\norganisations.\" But what does\n'political' mean? 'Political'\nnowadays has almost become a swearword, and it is associated\nwith corruption, power abuse...\nBut 'politicians' actually are\nelected or appointed\nrepresentatives, who (should) act in\nthe interests of the people they\nrepresent. Any of our 'Union\nHacks' are politically active. So\nplease consider this in future when\nyou refer to ICU 'not being\npolitical'. This is a false statement.\nICU is all about being politically\nactive.\nThe meaning of the phrase is\ndifferent. ICU does not want to be\nruled by parties, nor does it want to\nsee factions emerge within its\nranks, which is laudable. We don't want to confess to any political\nideology. NUS is functioning along\nthe party system. Unfortunately.\nHowever there are many other\nCollege Unions around the country\nwho want to remain politically\nun aligned. The most important\nfaction within NUS is the faction of\nthe 'independents'. This alliance of\npolitically un aligned people was\nformed with the aim of taking the\npower from the parties, and they\nsucceeded.\nI don't think it would be a betrayal of Imperial College Union\nideals to rejoin NUS. The only\nthing which remains to be seen is if\n(and how much) it is going to cost\nus.\nJohn Sinner\nCouncil ordinary member\nPhysics II\nAll Apologies\nDear Felix,\nThis letter is in response to\ncomplaints regarding OpSoc's poster advertising their current\nproduction of Kander and Ebb's, \"CABARET\" - in particular the\nincorporation of a swastika into the\ndesign.\nWe wish to apologise if this has\ncaused offense since this was not\nwhat was intended.\nThe design depicts various\nimages from the musical which is\nset in 1930's Berlin. The\nprominence of the Swastika is\nsymbolic, therefore, of the overbearing presence of the Nazi party\nin Germany, at this time.\n\"CABARET\" is the story of two\ncouples and their struggle to\nsurvive in this period. This very\nserious issue is balanced by\ninterwoven scenes at the Kit-Kat\nNightclub where sexuality and the\nneed to find pleasure is\nexaggerated as people attempt to\nescape from the real world.\nNeither the production nor the\nposters convey a pro-Nazi attitude;\nas anyone who comes to the show\nwill see - the message is quite the\nopposite. We do however\napologise to those who were\ndisturbed by our posters; they were\nEdited this week by Owain Bennallack\nintended to be provocative, but in\nno way to cheapen or make light of\nthe suffering inflicted by the Nazi's during the Second World War.\nDavid Watters\non behalf of OpSoc Committee\nNo NUS!\nDear Owain,\nI am writing in reply to L. Grogan's letter in the last issue of FELIX. She\nstates in her letter that \"my ICU\ncard does not bring any discount...\nwhich the NUS card does\". I am\nwondering where she has tried to\nuse it, as my ICU card has been\naccepted at four different cinemas,\nboth inside London and at home, a theatre and two dod gy local arts\ncentres. Only once did someone\nquery why I didn't have an NUS\ncard that looked like everyone\nelse's.I explained that Imperial\nwas not a member of the NUS,\nshowed him my ULU card, and\nbecause both cards have a photo,\nthey were willing to accept them as\nstudent ID even though their policy\nwas specifically \"a discount on\nproduction of an NUS card\". I have\neven managed to get into student-only events at NUS-run unions!\nMs. Grogan's second point is\nthat she can't get reductions in\nstationers. I don't know whether\nshe realises this, but our own ICU\nBookstore sells essentials at\nreduced prices anyway!\nFinally, if there is somewhere\nthat just will not accept the ICU\ncard, an ISIC card is available for\nonly \u00a35-6. This is valid for one year\nand has the advantages of being\nboth an NUS-badged card, and\ninternational. I really can't comment on MacDonald's because\nI genuinely am a veggie!\nWith the situation as it is we\nretain our independence to make\nfinancial decisions. We are allowed\nto join in NUS marches if we agree\nwith the cause, so it doesn't matter\nwhether we join or not. And what\nwould happen to the CCUs if ICU\nre affiliated? It is far more\nimportant for Imperial students to\nprotest about things that directly\naffect them, eg. the prices in\nSouthside shop, and the lack of\nsomewhere on campus to get\nCHEAP evening meals. This is what\nour Union should be dealing with.\nHelen-Louise Windsor\nChemistry 1\nLetters may be commented on by a guest editor, whose opinions may\nnot be those of the editor, and may\nbe cut due to space restrictions.\nDeadline: Monday 6.00pm.03 FEB05 FELIX MM\n\n"

We'll in fact be introducing\nour somewhat sensitive friends from other\ncolleges, to the subtler points of the Imperial\nCollege sense of humour. Yes, despite numerous bans (including a blanket ban from our\ngood friends at the NUS), we will be selling\nour 'critically acclaimed' Rag Mag. Having\nmade a few aesthetic improvements to their\nunion buildings we shall then be waved on\nour way to our next port of call by those nice\ncollege security men.

You could do just that if you enter our\nHalls Dirty Dozen this weekend, 4th February. No doubt your hall rep will have\norganised a team - look out for posters in\nyour hall. If not then come to the meeting\ntoday at 1.10pm in the Union Lounge and\nyou can sign up for a team. This also applies\nif you are not in hall but would like to take\npart anyway - the more people taking part,\nthe better.

However as\nmentioned in the last few editions of FELIX, Imperial is now getting its own LG B society.\nMany people come to London because it\nis home to a thriving and diverse gay scene,\nand as a student you are well placed to make\nthe most of what is on offer. The aim of establishing an Imperial group is to provide an\nessential social and support network for those\nboth sure and unsure of their sexual orient a tion.\nAlthough attitudes in society are slowly\nchanging, it is still not easy growing up gay\nor bisexual as homophobia is still prevalent.\nHowever going to University provides an\nexcellent opportunity for developing greater\nindependence and maturity. Many people\nfind it a good environment in which to be\nmore open about their sexuality. This is not\nto say that \"coming out\" is necessarily easy -I for one found it to be a tough experience.\nThe establishment of aL GB network will\nhelp those who need it.\nSo for all of you out there who want to\nmeet new people, please come along to the\nfirst weekly meeting. It's on Tuesday 7th February at 7.30pm in the Brown Committee\nroom on the top floor of the Union. If you\ncan't make it you can leave messages in the\nLGNetwork pigeonhole in the Union Office\nor with Lucy Chothia (ICU President).\n\n"

Surgery, a. catgut, silk\nthread, or wire used to stitch\ntogether two bodily surfaces, b. the\nsurgical seam formed after\nstitching, c. an independent US\nfilm.\nFilms shot in black and white\nmake a statement and in this\nrespect suture is no different.\nGrainy black and white films which\nare rooted and referenced within\nthe cinematic tradition and have\nunpronounceable titles hang\ndangerously over the edge of\ncleverness. Yet for all its obvious\nintelligence Suture is not a bad little\nfilm.\nToo much press emphasis has\nbeen placed on the central visual\nploy of the film (if you don't know\nwhat I'm going on about don't worry) but that not only spoils the\naudience's realisation, it also\nmisses the point that it is of minor\nimport to the strength of the plot.\nAll you need to know before you\nsee the film is that we start by\nfollowing the character of Clay\nArlington as he meets his weird\nand wealthy half brother, Vincent\nTowers, for the first time.\nThe reason for the scarcity of\npreview plot is that for the first half\nof the film at least, the viewer\nshould only have as much\ninformation about what's going on\nas Clay himself. Thrillers don't work\nif you know what's in the closet,\nremember? But Suture isn't just a thriller. After the sudden spark\nwhich wraps up the first third of the\nfilm we're into more conventional\nterritory. The loss of memory and\nthe transference of characters are a well used cinematic devices - a fact\nthat the directors of Suture\nrecognise when listing their\ninfluences; Frankenheimer's 'Seconds', Dmytryk's 'Mirage' and\nHitchcock's 'Spellbound'. In the\nland populated by beautiful plastic\nsurgeons, symbolically driven\ndreams and slowly narrating\nJapanese shrinks, Suture may slow\ndown but it retains its sure\nprogression to a nicely twisted end.\nAnd perhaps this is the most\nimpressive piece of the film. We're\ntaken back to the dreamlike\nflashback which started the film off.\nEven that is brought to a conclusion\nwhich affirms the subtle\nundercurrent that has gone before.\nIf you see Suture at the ICA\nyou also get the thirty minute short\ntropical fish thrown in for free too.\nThere's not a better combination.\nLeon (Jean Reno) is a hitman\nor a 'cleaner' whilst Mathilde\n(Natalie Portman) is the 12 year old\nnext door. But when her family are\nall murdered by a gang of drug\ndealers, led by a corrupt Drug\nEnforcement policeman, Mathilde\ngoes to live with Leon. In order to\nget revenge she asks Leon to teach\nher to become a 'cleaner' and in\nthe process they become much\ncloser. Leon's relationships with\nMathilde and his pot plant show\nthat he is not as unemotional as\nhe'd like to think.\nThe storyline is original, apart\nfrom the predictably corrupt\npoliceman, and the odd funny parts\nmake the film lighter going than it\notherwise would be. Although near\nthe end it goes a bit over the top -a whole police force to get one\nman?- the film ends well and is\nworth going to see. Don't be put off\nby the first five minutes of arty\ncamera shots. 0\n\n"

He accused the\nLabour Party of essentially\nreforming the SDP and applied\nhis staunchly socialist ideology\nto a wide range of issues, from\nthe European Union and the\nfuture of Northern Ireland to the\nfunding of further education.\nIn an emotive and often\nwitty speech, he said that the\nremoval of the current Government is critical to destroy the\npessimism that is inflicting the\npopulation.\nWhilst admitting that his\nown party sees him simply as 'an\nold dinosaur' he gave a damning\nindictment of the current\nparliament. Saying that the three\nmain stream parties are simply\nfollowing a monetarist agenda,\nhe joked that if put in the same\nroom, they could come out with\na joint manifesto 'before you had\ntime to stir the coffee'.\nMr Benn spoke angrily\nabout the high levels of\nunemployment, as well as the\nstate of the public services,\naccusing capitalism of working\nby a mechanism of fear.\nCriticising the customer\nmentality, he questioned an\nBenn: No 'old dinosaur'\nideology that only provided\npeople with services that they\ncould afford.\nHe was asked repeatedly to\ncomment on the current\nsituation in Northern Ireland, in\nthe light of his invitation to\nGerry Adams to join last year's Labour Party conference.\nDescribing Mr Adams as a 'courageous man', he suggested\nthat it was only a matter of time\nbefore he received the Nobel Peace prize. \"Mrs Thatcher was\nin touch with the IRA the whole\ntime she was there,\" he claimed,\nspeaking of the hypocrisy of te\ncurrent bartering.\nHe added dramatically: \"I hope that we will move toward\nthe withdrawal of the British\noccupational troops in Ireland.\"\nGBH?\nBY ANDREW SMITH An Imperial student has been\nthreatened with deportation and\na lengthy prison term after being\ncharged with gre vio us bodily\nharm by Belgravia Police. The\nstudent, a Japanese postgraduate,\nis waiting to find out whether an\nalleged assault on his girlfriend\nwill lead to a Crown Court\nprosecution. If successful, it\nwould result in a jail sentence of\nover five years.\nThe incident is alleged to\nhave taken place in the first week\nof this term. Despite not being a student at Imperial College, the\nJapanese girlfriend approached\nIC security in a battered and\ndisoriented condition to report\nthe incident.\nEarlier the police had\nreceived a999 call from a payphone in front of the\nMechanical Engineering Department, but had not been able to\nfind the caller. When the woman\neventually appeared, security\nwere able to contact the police\nwho took a statement which led\nthe following day to the arrest of\nthe Imperial student.\nPolice have twice opposed\nbail to the student who cannot be\nnamed for legal reasons.

    "content": "Standby\npole\nIt might seem stupid to lay the title\nof the 'best english novel' on the\nshoulders of Joseph Conrad's nost romo. For a start, Conrad\nwasn't even english but was born in\n1857 in what was then Poland. He\ndidn't learn to speak english until\nhe was twenty but even then he\nhad reservations about the cleanness of the language especially for\nexpressing emotions. Yet these are\nnot the issues to consider - we\nneed not concern ourselves with\nthe author's nationality or his\nchoice of language. The 'english\nnovel' is a far more subtle beast\nthan that.\nPerhaps in this specific instant\nmany disagree because of the\nclaims of 'Heart of Darkness'.\nCertainly this is classic Conrad\n-flitting from dusk on the Thames\nto the riverboat that snakes into the\ndark continent- but it doesn't really\nqualify. Its length, while not\nprohibitively short, must count\nagainst it whilst the lack of a hero\nfigure, in lieu of a more observatory approach, is a more weighty\nmatter. The purple haze created by\n'Apocalypse Now' has also affected\nthe way which we view the book.\nRather it is to 'Nostromo's' self\ntitled hero that we must look for the\nsecret ingredient.\nNostromo, the character, is not\nenglish but an italian living in the\n'country' of Costaguana. This is\nimportant. As Conrad himself says,\n\"had he been an Anglo-Saxon he\nwould have tried to get into local\npolitics\". The acceptability of\nNostromo himself is inherent in his\nforeign ness. You see that the core\nof the claim that 'Nostromo' is The\nEnglish Novel rests on the fact that\nthe english novel is the something\nthat is accepted from outside. It is\nthe foreign ness of 'Nostromo' that\nmakes it so powerful. Just as there\nis a corner of a field that is forever\nengland so there is a corner of\nenglish ness that is forever looking\noutwards.\nIn the particular spirit of the\nmoment we might consider the\n'english ness' of a figure like Eric\nCantona. Obviously he is not\nenglish in a nationalistic sense yet\nhe has been taken to heart in a way that players like Hoddle,\nShearer and Hughes never were or\nwill be. Likewise the dusty plains of\nSulaco, the exotic glitter of the San\nTome silver mine and the\nrevolutionary passions described\ncan be quintessential^ english. 0\nslipping down lives\nWhen weaving your way through\nthe neon lit streets of Theatreland it\nis not difficult to succumb to the\nbigtime showbiz z atmosphere.\nHowever, much as I love the West\nEnd it does have its drawbacks.\nThere is, however, an alternative\nand it comes in the form of Fringe\nTheatre\nThe Bush Theatre, Shepherds\nBush, is an ideal place to\nexperience fringe for the first time.\nIt is situated above a spacious pub\nand has a policy of nurturing new\nwriters and producing new plays.\nThe size of the theatre creates an\nintimacy unattainable in larger\nvenues. This intimacy has\nwonderful consequences in killer\njoe, an American production\nbrought to the Bush from Chicago.\nSet in a trailer home on the\noutskirts of Dallas, Texas, Killer Joe\nis a fast moving and, at times,\nshocking black comedy. It portrays\nan American family who occupy the\nlower divisions of the class league,\nin a hilarious and realistic way.\nThe family's strenuous daily\nactivities involve drinking Bud,\ndevouring KFC and watching mind\nnumbing amounts of television. The\nplot sits comfortably against this\nbackdrop of debauchery.\nChris is $6000 in debt and is\nin danger of losing his face if he\nfails to pay up. When he learns of\nhis mother's$50,000 life assurance\npolicy he plans to 'knock her off'\nwith the help of his father and his\nstepmother. They decide to hire\nKiller Joe Cooper, a crooked cop\nwho indulges in a little murdering\nto supplement his income. The\nnature of the operation means that\nJoe won't be paid until he's finished the job and he decides to\ntake Dottie, Chris' suppressed\nsister, as a retainer.\nThe writer, Tracy Letts, has\ncreated a cutting portrayal of a brain dead way of life. The dialogue\nis engaging, inventive and\nincredibly funny. Letts isn't afraid of\nshocking the audience and\nalthough the violence used is\nextremely graphic at times it never\nfeels out of place. When added to\nacting that convinces and absorbs\nthe product is a highly entertaining\nplay that has already won a Fringe\nFirst Award and deserves continued\nsuccess. 0\n\u2022 FRESH HAIR SALON \u2022\nthe best student offer in london!

The first proposal is a higher rated Graduate Tax,\nwhich he believes will be \"a fairer system in the long run.\"\nOther proposals include the\nAustralian-style 'fees income\ncontingent loan' and a 'main-ten ance income contingent loan'.\nInterestingly, the document is to\nbe sponsored by The Guardian\nand The Times Higher Education\nSupplement.\nCollege Maintenance.\nSome of you may have been\nwondering why there is a hole in\nDalby Court whilst a similar\ntransformation, complete with\nminiature derrick, is being\ncompleted around the Sherfield\nSecurity Desk.\nSubterranean maintenance\nwork in Dalby Court has\ncommenced to replace sections of\npipe running the length of the\nCourt. Multiple fractures have\nappeared in the cast iron water\nmains due to frost damage and\nold age. It is being replaced with\na more resistant polypropylene\npipe. Maintenance work and the\nmultitude of water springs\nshould have subsided by\nMonday.\nMeanwhile, the Sherfield\nSecurity Control is being\nexpanded to accommodate new\nsecurity alarm equipment and\nconsoles. When complete it will\nappear more aesthetic and\nprovide an enhanced reception\nservice for academic visitors and\nguests to the college.\nElection Rumour and Gossip\nBY ANDREW TSENG, NEWS EDITOR^ \u00bb AT'c Speculation is rife this\nweek in the build up\nmp Pfc fj; to the Imperial\nCollege Union (ICU)\nsabbatical elections.\nWith papers for the sabbatical\nposts of President, Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services),\nDeputy President (Clubs &\nSocieties) and FELIX Editor\ngoing up on Monday there has\nbeen intense rumour and gossip\nsurrounding possible future\nsabbaticals.\nRecent constitutional\nchanges have wreaked havoc with\nthe annual election rumour-mongering. The ICU Council meeting has historically been the\nplace were potential candidates\nare first spotted as they find out\nhow the union works. However,\nwith only one Council meeting\nhaving taken place speculators\nhave had to go elsewhere this\nyear.\nInstead, changes in the\nElections Committee are proving\nto be a strong indication of\npossible candidates. Of the eight\nnames initially pulled out of a hat\nto be on the Elections Committee\nor as a reserve, four of them have\ndeclared an interest in the\nelections: Luke Gietzen, SCC\nChair, Charlie Bell, R CSU President, Rosalind Prophett,\nR SMU Academic Affairs Officer\nand Vino d Ferandez, R SMU President. Luke Gietzen, SCC\nChair, is believed to be seeking\nthe job of Deputy President\n(Clubs & Societies). However, the\nreasons for a conflict are less\nobvious in the other three union\nofficials. FELIX understands\nthat Charlie Bell is not intending\nto stand, though whether he is\ninvolved in a campaign to get a Mines official into the\nPresidency or is supporting a RCSU campaign is unclear.\nOutside of the Elections\nCommittee various other\nrumours abound: following\nrecent publicity in FELIX, some\nhave suggested that Helen Teasdale, ICU Steward and\nordinary member of council and\nJane Hoyle, former Rag Chair,\nare considering a joint campaign\nfor the Presidency and the post of\nDeputy President (Finance &\nServices) respectively.\nContenders for the\nremaining post of FELIX Editor\nand Print Unit Manager are thin\non the ground due to a dir th of\nfinal year students and a lack of\npeople wishing to take a year\nlong break from their studies.\nHowever, of the final year\nstudents at FELIX, Marcus\nAlexander, Columns Editor, Paul\nDias, the mastermind behind the\ndesign and layout of this year's FELIX and Rachel Walters,\nNews Journalist and occasional\nNews Editor, are thought to be\ninterested in running for the job.\nEach candidate must be\nproposed by a full member of\nICU and seconded by twenty\nothers. Nominations will close\nwhen papers come down on\nFriday 17th February after which\ncampaigning for all posts may\nbegin. New Election will also\nstanding for all posts.\nThe Beast of Bodmin Moors\nWell, as another dusk i ly clad\nmaiden day passes beyond my\njaded gaze... hah aha. Seriously, I was very pleased to note the\nappearance of college publications called ' FEEL SIK' and\n' FI DO' last week although I think the editors of both may\nhave been misled in their market\nresearch. After all, ' FEEL SIK' sounds a little like FELIX doesn't it? And come to think of\nit the content was familiar...\nHmmm mm, maybe those\nvital news disks stolen by that\ndaring gang who dynamited the\ndoors of FELIX TOWERS weren't nicked by the Microclub\nafter all...\nCabaret\nI had quite a good night on\nTuesday, courtesy of the Operatic\nSociety. Without wishing to say\ntoo much, lest my comments be\ntaken as ironic and my magazine\nbe pinched, it was really rather\ngood. The plot bounces along to a soundtrack of burlesque, lusty\nperformances and no, the\nswastika on the poster doesn't proclaim the latest outpourings\nof NaziSoc. Obviously, the\nopposite message is sent and the\nshow ends at the brink of the\nNazi's brief but visibly appa ling reign. I think there are still\ntickets left for Friday and the\nSaturday night finale so why not?\nElections\nDon't forget the sabbatical papers\ngo up on Monday. If you feel like\ntrying for any of the posts then\nsign your name up, together with\na proposer and twenty second ers, opposite the Union office. Don't forget that you should talk to the\ncurrent holder of whatever post\nyou seek to stand fc r, to make\nsure you know what you're\nletting yourself in for!\nElection Publicity\nAlso, if you've already decided\nyou're standing for any of the\nposts, printing your promotion\nmaterial (ie. propaganda) will\nprobably by cheaper than\nphotocopying it. We can print\nflyers, A3 and A4 posters etc in\nthe Print Unit but we have only\na limited time slot in which to fit\nin all those interested so come\nand see us ASAP. You cannot put\nup publicity before papers come\ndown but you will probably want\nyour material ready by then.\nCredits\nEditor Owain Bennallack\nPrinter Andy Thompson\nBusiness Manager Tim Bavister\nAdvertising Manager Helen Randall\nEditorial Team\nArt & Literature Jon Jordan\nCinema Wei Lee\nClubs, Societies & Union Piers Daniell\nColumns Marcus Alexander\nFeatures Kate Cox Layout and Design Paul Dias\nMusic Vik Bansal\nNews Andrew Tseng\nPhotography Ivan Chan & Diana Harrison\nS Flfes The Team\nSeven Day Guide Jeremy Thomson\nSport Juliette Decode and Mark Baker\nStandby Jon Jordan\nTheatre Joseph Barr\nEditorial Assistance\nCollating Last Week Jon Jordan, Paul\nDias, David Cohen, Rachel Walters\nHelpfulness Tim St Clare\n0\n3\nf gb95 FELIX bu "

    "content": "Feature\nIsn't getting out of bed\nenough?\nKamran Malik explores depression and what you can do about it\nSome days just trying to get out of bed is\nhard enough. I can go to sleep all right\nbut wake up at stupid times like four or five\nin the morning and then I can't sleep again. I just lie in bed mulling things over again and\nagain...\"\nIvan is a graduate who is depressed.\nSince finishing his degree last summer he has\nbeen unable to find work and over the past\nfew months he has been on a downward spiral\nof lack of confidence and depression.\n\"I just feel so useless, as if life is\npassing me by... I see people come and go\nfrom work and I feel trapped and so stupid.\nI 've been feeling like this for three or four\nmonths, I think. After I graduated my family\njust expected me to walk into a well-paid job.\nI am a graduate after all... Then the bank\nreally started hassling me about my overdraft,\nwanting me to pay it off... I feel like such a failure.\"\nDepression is a common experience,\nbut feeling sad or miserable when things are\nnot right is not a bad thing. The problem\noccurs when the depression dominates your\nlife and just existing day to day becomes\ndifficult. In a small number of cases the\ndepression can be clinical, needing special\ntherapy, but for the majority, like Ivan, the\nsolution could be simple counselling. Ivan is\nsceptical about seeking help himself. \"I'm not\nreally into going to counselling... The problem is that I'm unemployed - how can\nthey help with that?\"\nTo a large extent, depression goes\nunrecognised and untreated. According to the\nmental health charity MIND, a majority of\npsychiatric referrals are due to depressive\ndisorders. Twenty per cent of the general\npopulation may be depressed at any one time,\nbut only 2-4% are clinically depressed. This\nleads to a great deal of personal and family\nsuffering which, according to MIND, is\nunnecessary: \"Depression is recognisable and\ntreatable, but unfortunately it goes undetected\nin up to 70% of cases.\" People like Ivan suffer\nalone when there is help available.\nWhat about depression in students? Do\nMIND's facts and figures apply to Imperial? I spoke to Dr Irene Weinreb, who manages\npsychotherapy at the Imperial College Health\nCentre.\n\"We do see quite a lot of cases of\nFELIX03 FEB95 depression, but I think it's quite important,\nbefore you label people, to separate depressive\nillnesses, which may require treatment with\nantidepressants, from reactive depression,\nwhich is often due to the stress of work or the\nbreak-up of a relationship.\" Each case is\ntreated individually at the health centre. \"It's a bit like being a detective: you ask them\nloads of things until you have an idea of what\nthe problem is.\"\nThis is a relief, since I 've found that\nreading symptoms of depression out of\ntextbooks leads me to the conclusion that I'm depressed too!\n\"I don't work like that and many of the\ndoctors here don't work like that either. I think it's more to do with how the person is\nfeeling and behaving.\"\nThese days depression is big news,\nespecially among students. Last month the\nDaily Express reported \"Cambridge hit by\noutbreak of student despair.\" Statistics\ncompiled by the Samaritans show that suicide\nrates among 15-24-year-old men increased by\n71% over the last decade. Although more\nwomen than men attempt suicide, men are\nmore liable to succeed.\nStudent hardship is increasing the\nincidence of depression everywhere.\nAccording to Dr Weinreb, the incidence has\nincreased dramatically over the last 10 years.\n\"Certainly students have a much tougher time\nnow.\" London students have a particularly\nhard time. \" Living in London with\nproblems about accommodation and money -and the fact that Imperial is a non-campus\nscience university makes it more difficult.\"\nWork pressures and expectations of success\nfrom family don't help.\nWe are all increasingly prone to\ndepression. Life is getting harder and the\ncaring, sharing nineties aren't all that great.\nWhat can we do when things are getting so\nbad that despair takes over your life?\n\n"

Hello?\nQUESTIONS PLEASE\nSOLID OR LIQUID?\nDAVE COHEN SPEAKS HIS BRAINS\nScience Line began in 1993 as a phone-in question\nservice after Equinox programmes on Channel 4.\nFour programmes were chosen, on the subjects of the\nSpace Shuttle, Memory, Air Traffic and Dinosaurs,\nto pilot the service. Thousands of people phoned in, and their\nquestions were answered by scientists and science students.\nIn March 1994, during the first British Science Week, the\npermanent Science Line was launched. The service now receives calls\nevery day on subjects ranging from genetic engineering to prime\nnumbers.\nScience Line follows in the footsteps of the\nfirst European public science service which\nwas set up in the Netherlands. But how good\nare these services?

The different answers on offer O What flew Scientist readers said.\nAlthough for me the Science Line started off as a financial\nsaviour, it very quickly turned into my favourite Sunday\nafternoon pastime. Originally part of the BBC and now an\nindependent charity, under the wing of the BSS (Broadcasting\nSupport Services), Science L me is a non-profit making\norganisation whose aim is to publicly promote science. It\nprovides a telephone information service to Channel 4 and Radio 5 science-oriented programmes for the cost of a local telephone call. And, combined, the\nteam is able to answer questions on most science and technology related\nsubjects.\nMy two hour stint, for example, revolves around the Radio 5 Programme\n\"The Big Byte\" which is a weekly focus on\nwhat's going on in pop-computing.\nSometimes I feel like a glorified secretary\naccepting competition entries, or telling\nSometimes If ec i like a glorified\nsecretary, but none of that detracts\nfrom the times when I hear that\n\u2022'a a ahh hh'' of comprehension\npeople where they can get connected to\nthe Internet. But occasionally the more\nintriguing characters surface and pose\nreal hum-dinger s, like the one who\nwanted to know the implications Electronic\nMedia and Communications will have on\nour society in the next generation(l), and\nthe man who insisted that email will lead\nto the downfall of humanity. Scott, who\nrings every week to discuss possible ways\nof improving ISDN bandwidth, does tend\nto get a little tedious, as do the tens of\npeople who are willing to swear blindly\nthat they have witnessed ball-lighting. But\nthat doesn't detract from the times when\nyou hear that \" a a ahh hh\" of com-pre hens ion.

In older buildings, windows are thicker at the bases...\"\nThe Last Word, 17 Sept 1994: \"...glass is a solid at normal\ntemperature. It will not flow and experiments have been done to\nshow this. Bubbles in obsidian, a volcanic glass, are still spherical\nafter more than a million years in spite of the weight of overlying\nrocks, which exert a much larger force than gravity does on the glass\nalone. Old glass windows panes are usually thicker at \u2022ho bottom\nbecause they were installed that way for convenience (they \u00abf|> rtp t fall over easily and remain in position while tl^ are no in tea) Jven\nso, old panes are sometimes found installed *hick edge up,\nespecially in stained glass windows...\" \\ Vf\nDo you hau eau iei u on glass?

In a liquid the atom's\" na ven't found\ntheir sites. They haven't got their ideal bonds. The atoms aren't arranged in a lattice as they would be in a solid.\"\nMe: \"What's a lattice?\"\nLiner 2 (trying not to use technical terms): \"If you think of a cube, with an\natom at each corner, then that is a lattice like a salt crystal.\"\nMe: \"...e rrr...\" Liner 2 (quickly): \"Here's an analogy. Think of lava - molten rock. When rock\nbecomes lava it is exposed to the air and cools very quickly. It forms a glassy\nsort of substance called obsidian. Obsidian used to be really valuable\nbecause very sharp tools could be made out of it. If the lava cools slowly - if\nit doesn't get exposed to the air - then it forms rhyolite instead, which has\ncrystals in it. The crystals get a chance to form because it cools slowly\nMe (the-light-has-dawned ly): \"So if glass was cooled slowly then crystals\nwould form in it?\"\nLiner 2: \"Yes - if you look at Roman glass, it has often started to de vitr if y Crytals have started to form, and the glass doesn't look so clear.\"\nMe: \"And supercooled just means cooled very quickly.\"\nLiner 2 (relieved): \"Yes.\"\n03FEB9 S FELIX MM\n\n"
