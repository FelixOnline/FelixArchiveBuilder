    "content": "Drivel\nLetters\nDeranaged\nDear Nigel\nOkay, I admit it, I am a figment\nof the deranged imagination of a; FELIX hack, who, in a moment of\nstress, dreamt me up in an attempt\nto fill up an empty space that\nsuddenly dropped through a freak\nwormhole in space and landed in\nthe FELIX Office.\nI really do not exist, therefore this\nand any further letters purporting\nto come from me are merely caused\nby temporal resonances from the\noriginal wormhole.\nYours\nDylan James\nShocked\nDear Nigel,\nIam shocked, dismayed and disgusted by your continued\ndeliberate policy of refusing to lose\nor to forget to print letters by from\nEmmmannnuell Sararadakakiss. I cannot see why, when you easily\nmanage to forget clubs articles by\nRoger Davies, you claim not to be\nable to lose letters from Mr Saradakadakis.\nThis is a disgraceful situation, and\nunless you co-operate immediately,\nI will write to the Ayatollah asking\nhim to have you condemned to\ndeath.\nYou rs,\nAlistair Goodall\nPuzzled\nDear Nigel,\nSomething strange has just\noccurred to me, if Sidney\nHarbour-Bridge hates Imperial as\nmuch as he says he does, why has\nhe stayed here for six years? Could\nsomebody please explain this\ninteresting paradox to me.\nYours\nExtremely puzzled\nReviews\nMe and my mates went to see this\nfilm after a night out on the town.\nActually we wanted to see '3000\nVirgins', which was on at the\nCinema next door but the Manager\ntook offence when we humorously\nquestioned his sexuality. So we\nwent to see this 'Snow White' thing.\nWell to summarise the plot:\nthere's this good looking bird called\n'Snow White' who lives in some\ncastle or the other, a bit like the one\nin 'Frankenstein and the Castle of\nDeath'. This castle is run by some\nQueen (a real one this time unlike\nthe manager) who spends half her\ntime talking to the bloody mirror. Bit\nnuts, if you ask me. Funny thing is,\nthat the mirror talks back. Now if I had a talking mirror I'd sell it off\npretty damn quick, but all the queen\nseems to do is ask it 'Who's the\nfairest of 'em all' or something like\nthat. Now its hardly surprising that\nthe mirror eventually geto\nand tells her of this Snow Whitt 0\nwho's a hell of a lot hornier than she\nis.\nNow, I was a bit drunk and I wasn't totally following the plot. But\nas far as I can remember, Snow\nWhite runs off into a nearby forest\nand sneaks into an abandoned sort\nof holiday chalet like a log cabin sort\nof thing. Then there's this bit\ninvolving lots of animals, seven\nd war vic men, and a very happy\nlooking Snow White. I think at this\npoint that I should mention that she\nis a rather tasty 32:22:32, which,\nalthough meagre for my tastes, is\nquite pleasingly curvy.\nNow this queen is a nasty piece\nof work; as bent as a two bob note\nand a witch to top it all off. And she\nlooks like one. Well, this tart decides\nto bump little Snowy off, and this\nwitch is dead sneek y about it.\nFirst she gets this apple which is\nhalf red and half green, polishes it\nup nicely, then as a finishing touch\npoisons the red half.\nNow, this pon sey Prince arrives,\nwho does nothing for the storyline.\nHe kisses the 'dead' Snow White;\nguess this guy must be a necrophilia c. Bet he's a bit shocked\nwhen she wakes up and tongues\nhim back. Mind you, I bet he's not\nat all pissed off; who would be.\nThey fall in love straight away, must\nbe a good kisser this Prince, and she\nrides off on the back of his horse.\nr alto! I think she should have\nsiu, forest w ne re there was\nat least the^.se duel what\nwith the possibility ud war vic sex. That would be be uc. than '3000 virgins' any day. Editorial\nMy week spent as FELIX Editor was a very enlightening and revealing experience. Of all the things which struck me this week, none was more surprising than the ease with which such a large publication could be put together. It is quite apparent that the FELIX editor is very much under worked. Take this edition of FELIX for example; it was put together from scratch in only three hours. I found myself asking why the FELIX Editor shouldn't be given more of the Union Office responsibilities to relieve us Union Sabbaticals of our overpowering ly heavy workload. Is there any reason why he or she should not be made responsible for cleaning the floor of the Union Office and making the Union staff tea and coffee? Yet, whilst Mr Goodwin goes to great pains to point out how overworked he is, he persistently abuses FELIX for his own ends. Take last weeks story all edging reduced portion sizes in the Caterpillar Cafe. It was completely fabricated! In fact I have arranged for portion sizes to be doubled, and Iam paying for this OUT OF MY OWN POCKET! Not only this, he has b latent ly printed defamatory lies about myself in order to turn everyone else in College against me. And he has succeeded. Isn't it about time that the Union took editorial control of FELIX to prevent these lies being perpetrated any further? It is obvious that all FELIX Editors are COMPLETELY DERANGED and that only a person with intelligence enough to take up the heavy burden of Union Presidency should be allowed to decide what should be printed in FELIX. Mr Goodwin is not only a bad FELIX editor, he is downright corrupt. It is common knowledge that Mr Goodwin is a member of the Freemasons, but less widely known is the fact that he buys paper at twice its normal price as part of a shady Masonic deal with a local grandmaster. Not only this, but he gives a free photocopying service for people with funny handshakes. But Mr Goodwin has not stopped there. Driven by an insane hatred of the Irish, he has persistently persecuted anyone he suspects of having Irish Ancestry and has charged them double for photocopying. Just look at the way he has treated Em manual Sara diki s;he has printed all of his letters thus making the man look a complete fool. Finally, I should make it clear that Mr Goodwin is a pervert who only washes once a month, never changes his socks, is bald and wears a wig. Credits\nThanks firstly to myself for producing such a superior edition of FELIX, S ez Wilkinson for groveling at my feet, Dave S medley for boosting my ego, Doug King for doing all the menial jobs which were beneath me, Adam Harrington for sweeping the floor, Rose and Dean who don't really deserve thanks as they are paid to be here, and all the clubs whose budget I threatened to cut if they did not help collate.

    "content": "Boring\nIC Wins Americas cup\nImperial College boat club stormed\nto victory in the final leg of the\nAmericas cup series.\nThe victory was totally\nunexpected by most sailing experts,\nwho predicted that the multi million\ndollar American yacht, which had\nseven hulls and a crew of ninety-three people, would win easily.\nHowever, nobody had allowed for\nthe I.C. team's secret weapon. The\nI.C. crew contained all three\nsabbaticals from the Union office,\nand at the start of the race they all\nstood at the back of the boat and\nstarted making speeches\nsimultaneously. The huge quantities\nof hot air thus produced propelled\nthe I.C. boat to an easy victory,\nbeing timed at a maximum speed of\nthree hundred and twenty seven\nm.p.h. Union President Nigel Baker later\nwas asked to comment on having\nmissed breaking the water speed\nrecord by only 4.7 m.p.h. and. replied that he and his colleagues\nwere not in good form on the day,\nand should be able to produce far\nmore meaningless waffle during a future attempt,\nscheduled for the\nwhich is\nSummer.\nbeing\nSmith wins pools Opportunity\nKnocks\nCollege Secretary, John Smith, has\nannounced his intention to retire\nafter winning 3.5 Million pounds on\nthe Football Pools.\nMr. Smith, 22, told FELIX: 'Its\namazing: all I did was put down eight crosses at random, exactly like\nmarking an exam paper. I'm overjoyed'\nSources in Sherfield say that Mr. Smith went to see the Rector, Eric\nAsh, immediately after learning of\nhis win. Professor Ash has refused\nto tell FELIX what had happened\nduring the meeting but it is reported\nthat the words ' F***O** Eric, I can\nafford to leave now' were heard by\nthe entire fifth floor.\nPerson or persons unknown\ngained entry to the FELIX office\nin the middle of the night this\nThursday to produce a spoof\nedition of FELIX, called fi do. A source interviewed in the\nFELIX office said ' A jokes a joke,\nbut to print something this boring\ngoes beyond the bounds of satire.\nMr. Smith says that he will be\nspending the money on buying the\ngovernment of a small Caribbean\nIsland.\nFido includes three pages of\ninformation copied from\ngovernment leaflets about Poll\nTax, a two page expose of future\nplans for the Bookshop (yawn),\nand a one page extract from a cookery book.

In Brief\nTop academics at Imperial have\nrecently discovered a new group of\nparticles, the existence of which has\npreviously only been inferred.\nExtensive study of College lecture\ntheatres and tutorials has proven\nbeyond doubt that both lecturers\nand problem sheets emit large\nnumbers of particles called\n'conf u sons.' These particles, which have a spin\nof mu minus transmit intense waves\nof confusion to any student struck\nby them. It is surprising that these\nparticles have not been discovered\nbefore as they are too be found in\ngreat abundance at IC.\nAnother particle in the same\nfamily is the Borion, a particle which\ntransmits boredom. If large numbers\nof Borions and conf u sons are\nconfined, for example in a lecture\ntheatre, they interact to produce an\nextremely powerful depressive field.\nThis has the effect of warping the\ntime-subjectivity continuum, thus\nallowing a one hour lecture to last\nfor much longer.\nResearchers have deduced that\nthe maximum possible depressive\nfield intensity, known as the\nSchwartzchild intensity would be\ncapable of making a one hour\nlecture last 37 hours.\nStrenuous attempts have been made\nto reach this barrier, particularly in\nMechanical Engineering lectures,\nbut due to the log inverse square\nrelationship between depressive\nfield strength and particle\nconcentration, the maximum subjective time dilation coefficient so\nfar reached is 36.9993, achieved in\n.i lubrication lecture.\nThe discovery of the two particles\nhas led to the post ul ation of two anti\nparticles of opposite spin, the\ninterest ion and the understand on. Unfortuanately, in common with\nmany other particle- anti particle\nsystems, the anti particles are\nincredibly rare.\nLate News\nWe have just heard that due to a computer error, Mr. John Smith,\nwas overpaid for his pools win. A spokesman for Littlewood's Pools\ntold FELIX: ' Mr. Smith's original\ncheque has been invalidated and his\nnew cheque for \u00a33.50 is to be posted\non as soon as possible.'\nSources in Sherfield says that Mr. Smith is now taking steps to placate\nthe Rector and to get his job back.\nHe was last seen entering the\nRector's Office carrying a can of boot\npolish and some hand cream.\nMidnight FELIX horror\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publication Board and is printed by the Imperial College Union Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London, SW7\n( le l\"''^5111ex t3515)Ed lt or: Nl Sel Baker Business Manager: Reggie Blenerhasset.

    "content": "FELIX\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nExinations canceled\nThis years examinations have\nbeen cancelled after the discovery of\nprinting errors in examination\npapers last week. The College say\nthat it is now too late and too costly\nto pe print the papers, but academics\nhope to be able to make a fair\nassessment of students'\nperformances from course work.\nI he printing mix up was\ndiscovered on Tuesday when\nMechanical Engineering students\ncomplained that they were unable\nto answer an v of the questions on\ntheir Stress Analysis paper. Later in\nthe day, Physics students sitting\ntheir second v ear Quantum Mechanics exam claimed that the\npaper was u natural lv easy.\nInvestigations by external\nexaminers revealed that, owing to\nerrors made at the printing\ncompany, students had been\nmistakenly handed the plans for a la panes e lawn mower.\nProfessor Eric Laithwaite of\nElectrical Engineering admitted that\nhe was 'baffled' when students\nasked him whether part MZ37\nshould slot into part CR251 or screw\ninto PQRI.\n\\lt bough examination papers\nthroughout College have been\nwithdrawn, academics have denied\nallegations that other departments\nhave been affected.\nBut a source in Budget Printing\nLimited has admitted that the\nBioiogv examination had been\nmistakenly replaced by extracts from\nFirst Among Sequels , the latest\nbook by Jefferv Archer.\n. Invigilators first noticed\nsomething was wrong when half of\nthe students fell asleep during the\nexam although FELIX Deputy\nId it or, Chas Brereton later told\nreporters that he found the\nexamination 'quite interesting.'\nThe source also admitted that the\ncompany had accident lv printed\nthird v ear mathematics papers\nwhich made sense.\nA spokesman from the\nComputing Department denied that\nthere had been an v mistakes with\ntheir exams and claimed that 'the\nlive ware had interacted logically\nwith the paper ware with no obvious\nsigns ot sv stem breakdown.'\nThe Rector, Professor Eric Ash, was reported to be looking for\nsomeone to blame.\nThe Union Staff became overnight TV personalities when they appeared on University Challenge, facing\nAberystwyth Polytechnic's Needlework Department. In a close and hard-fought contest IC scored 130 points\nto Bangor's135 to reach overall last place, setting a new record of the overall lowest score ever achieved in University challenge. Ian Morris was said to be 'displeased' with the result. His body was later discovered\nby Police, after he had shot all the other teams, several police officers, Bamber Gascoigne and finally himself.\nNigel Baker said, 'We are sorry to see Wendy go but this may improve our chances for next year.'\nFour Chinese\nstudents in\nhospital\nConcern is mounting over the\nhealth of six members of the\nChinese Society at the end of their\none week 'eat in' in the Union\nSnack Bar.\nFour of the students were taken\ninto intensive care on Friday after\nsuffering chronic malnutrition and\nfood poisoning during their week\nJong gesture of solidarity with\nstudents on hunger strike in Peeking.\nFELIX Deputy Editor Chas Brereton said that he was 'very\nconcerned' by the incident and said\nthat the Union would take every\nstep possible to assist Chinese\nSociety in their fight against political\no press ion in China.\nI le added ' No one can accuse us\nof being an uncaring Union. 1 will\nbe delivering pot noodles to the\nstudents in hospital and shaking\ntheir hands personally.
