You can also vote by post or proxy if you\nwon\u2019t be around on the day but you need to make sure you apply for\nthese separately. If you are living in halls you will need to make sure you\nare registered because changes to voter registration mean you are not\nautomatically on the electoral register.\nWho is eligible to vote in the EU Referendum?\nA British or Irish citizens living in the UK\nA Commonwealth citizens living in the UK who has (or does not require) leave to remain in the UK\nHaven\u2019t decided which way to vote yet?\nWe\u2019ll have campaign teams around College for the next few weeks to give you all the facts you need to make an informed choice. We\u2019ll also be\nhosting a debate on Thursday 2 June at 18:30 in Skempton with speakers arguing both sides if you still need persuading either way.\nIn support of Mental Health Awareness Week, the Student Counselling\nService and partners are asking you to start a conversation about mental\nwellbeing.\nThis initiative was created by the Mental Health Foundation and is\ncelebrated every year in May. The aim is to get people to talk more\nopenly about the issues that surround mental health and to raise\nawareness of the issues people face.\nTo help you do this, the Staff Health and Wellbeing Team have put together a range of talks, lectures, and events including fitness classes and\nswimming sessions at Ethos and meditation with the Chaplaincy. Further support is also provided by The Advice Centre in the Union, which can be\nespecailly during exam time - it is time to get people thinking about their own mental wellbeing.

Are you a budding photographer? Get in touch. Photo Credit: Miquel Sureda\nL\narge shoals of fish attract\na range of predators\nincluding multiple species\nof whale. A recent study\nthough, found that although many\nspecies might be feasting on herring\nat the same time, whales tend to\nstick with their own kind when\npreying. By mapping different\nwhale calls, research found evidence\nof clear whale groupings within\ndense herring shoals: humpback\nwhales clustered at either end of\nthe spawning grounds, while mink,\nfin and blue whales set up feeding\nterritories between them. Passive\nocean acoustic wave guide remote\nsensing showed that calls increase\ndramatically at night time, when\nextremely dense shoals form and\ndissipated during the day when\nherring scattered throughout the\nseafloor. However, further research\nmust be carried out to discover\nwhether there is territorialism\noccurring or if they are selecting\nthese locations based on their\ndifferent foraging mechanisms.\nA\nt Sh!t Sc!ence we like to\ndefend the lil\u2019science,the\nscience that gets bullied,\nthe science that gets\nwedgies from the bigger sciences\nwhen it tries to speak up,because we\nbelieve that every science, no matter\nhow puny, has value and should be\nrespected. This week: archaeology.\nNeed I say more?\nYes, archaeology, or the discovery\nof things that happened literally\nthousands of years ago. Going to\nan archaeology conference is like\nwatching an episode of Sherlock,\n\u201cThis fragment of a piece of bone\nwas positioned two centimetres\nEast of the remains of a fire pit\nwhich is evidenced by these three\nflecks of carbon matter. Therefore,\nAustralopithecus tried to kill Homo\nerectus!\u201d Elementary, until another\narchaeologist finds another tiny\nfragment of bone on the other side\nof the planet, and the entire field is\nshaken to its core. It is a strenuous,\narduous,ridiculous nerd of a science;\nThe study suggests that our ancenstors might have had a better diet than\nus, but maybe they just never stopped eating. Photo Credit: Mike Mozart\nMARIANNE GUENOT\nSh!t Sc!ence\nAngry old man vindicated: Food was better back in the day\nbut it is not useless, because looking\ninto the past gives us a better grasp\nof what is coming in our future.\nThat is the case of a new study\npublished in Clinical Anatomy this\nweek. Sometimes all that is left of\na time period is human remains,\nso archaeologists have learned\nto read anatomical clues to the\nconditions in which people were\nliving. One such clue is a condition\ncalled cribra orbitalia (CO), where\nthe bone inside the eye socket\nbecomes porous. This condition\nis generally accepted to be a telltale sign of anaemia due to iron\ndeficiency, periods of malnutrition\nor infection. If archaeologists find\na high prevalence of CO in the\npopulation, they take it as a sign\nthat these poor people had a rather\nrough time of it. \u201cBut there\u2019s been\na lot of debate about the prevalence\nof CO in modern populations,\nwith some saying it had effectively\ndisappeared,\u201d says Ann Ross, coauthor of the study. The scientists\ncompared 245 prehistoric,\n381 historic (pre-20th\ncentury)\nand 218 modern skeletons.\nSurprisingly, the researchers\nfound that not only was CO\nnot extinct, it was relatively\ncommon, with 12.35 percent\nof modern North Americans\nand 16.8 percent of modern\nSouth Africans displaying it.\nEven more surprisingly, this\nis a higher prevalence than in\ntheir historic counterparts. \u201cWe\nthink the increased prevalence\nof CO in the modern skulls may\nbe due to intestinal parasites in\nsome populations and iron-poor diet\u201d, Ross says.\nTherefore, like many a time\nbefore, knowledge of prehistory\nsheds light on modern culture.\nThese findings, Ross says,\nshow that \u201cdisadvantaged\nsocioeconomic groups, and\nparts of the developing world,\nare still struggling with access\nto adequate nutrition.\u201d\n\n"

Welcome to this\nyour fifth-to-last issue\nof FELIX for this\nacademic year. No, I\u2019m not counting\nthem down. I just want to put a\nsuitable amount of pressure on you\nto get involved.\nNever written for us? That doesn\u2019t\nmatter.All you need to do is send an\nemail to one of the section editors,\neither pitching an idea for an article\nor if you\u2019ve written something\nalready, the piece itself. It\u2019s that\neasy! We accept procrasti-pitches\nand feelings-heavy comment pieces\nthat you will regret having written\nin your thirties.\nI am biased, but getting involved\nin the paper is great. Nothing beats\nthe feeling of seeing your name in\nprint, correctly spelled. Even if it is\nspelled wrong, you still feel pretty\nnice. We\u2019re a friendly bunch, with\na nice big office in the basement\nof Beit, with Macs and hot-takes\ngalore. So write a couple of pieces,\nsee if you like it, and then think\nabout joining our team of editors\nnext year.\nA word from the Editor\nEditor-in-Chief\nGrace Rahman\nNews Editor\nMatt Johnston\nComment Editors\nTessa Davey and Vivien Hadlow\nScience Editors\nJane Courtnell and Lef Apostolakis\nArts Editors\nIndira Mallik, Jingjie Cheng and\nMax Falkenberg\nMusic and Games Editor\nCale Tilford\nFilm Editor\nFred Fyles\nPuzzles Editors\nHamish Beck and Roxana Radu\nFood Editor\nSanjay Bhattacharya\nClubs & Societies Editor\nAbi de Bruin\nTV Editor\nSaad Ahmed\nTechnical Babe\nLuke Granger-Brown\nCopy Editors\nMattin Mir-Tahmasebi and Henry\nLloyd-Laney\nNews\nLetters\nComment\nFeatures\nScience\nMusic\nFilm\nGames\nFood\nTV\nPuzzles\nHangman\nWelfare\n3\n6\n7\n10\n12\n15\n19\n21\n22\n25\n26\n31\n32\nThe first time I wrote for the\npaper was in the TV section. Like\nmany media-leaning millennials,\nmy instant reaction to particularly\nvisceral content (Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s\nLemonade, Katie Hopkins) is a\nthink piece. So I sent something\ninto FELIX, and then accidentally\nbecame the music editor. That was\na laugh, so I thought I\u2019d give being\nthe full-time editor a try. You guys\nagreed, so I did this for year. This\nwas slightly more serious, but still\nmainly a laugh. Regardless of your\nambitions in a career sense, I urge\nyou to use the fact that Imperial\nhas a student newspaper to improve\nyour writing skills. We have editors\nhere to help and guide you. Every\njob has an application form, and the\nonly way to improve your written\ncommunication is to practise. I\nsound like your mum, I know.

In this editorial,\nDr Lamb was described as a bigot,\nwhich FELIX accepts was an\noffensive and unnecessary word\nto use, and also suggested that Dr\nLamb disapproved of people of\nmixed ethnic heritage, which is\nincorrect. Therefore, FELIX would\nlike to offer an apology to Dr Lamb\nfor the accusation of bigotry. In\nfact, Dr Lamb has supervised and\nworked alongside international\nstudents throughout his career, and\nhas enjoyed decades of friendship\nwith students of many nationalities\nand ethnicities.\nAs Editor of FELIX, I retract\nthese comments and apologise to\nDr Lamb for the offense we have\ncaused him.\nAn apology to Dr Bernard Lamb\n\n"

The fact that artistic freedom\nled to the creation of one of FotL\u2019s\nmost tense and restrained albums\nwas really surprising as there was a\nclear move towards minimal songs\npunctuated with staccato riffing,\nremoving some of the more \u2018fun\u2019\nelements of their sound.\nIt\u2019s welcome then that The Peace\u2026\nshowcases a more multi-faceted\napproach. Whilst the jarring\nstaccato riffing songs are still\npresent, they are used as occasional\nspiteful moments rather than the\nmain body of this album. This has\nallowed room for some really bass\nheavy songs and reintroduction of\nthe some more playful elements that\nFotL used so well in their earlier\nefforts. This variation in approaches\nmakes The Peace... a significantly\neasier listen than How to... and\nadds impact to both.The bass heavy\nsongs feel heavier, the stuttering\ndead-stop guitar led songs, such as\n\u2018Miners Gruel\u2019, more visceral, and\nthe catchy moments more hooky.\nThe increased amount of really\nbassy songs has to be attributed\nto bassist Julia Ruzicka. Her\ninventive, thick bass lines have\nbeen increasingly become a part\nof FotL\u2019s sound. Songs such as the\nnasty \u2018If AT&T Drank Tea What\nWould BP Do?\u2019 to the groovy \u2018The\nLimits of Battleships\u2019 are led by her\nwonderfully dirty overdriven bass\nlines and mark a real development\nfrom the more passive role the bass\nhas served in previous albums. This\nadds an extra dimension to FotL\u2019s\nsound giving them a much thicker\nsound, taking the lead away from\nThis is a sad picture *sad emoji*.

This varied performance\nsets FotL apart from their followers\nand imitators. With so many other\nbands taking a one track approach\non their vocal lines, the depth and\nbreadth of Falco\u2019s weird singing\nvoices which are essentially used\nas a second melodic instrument\nare always suprising. From the\nwhimsical singing on \u2018Miner\u2019s\nGruel\u2019, to the desperate nasally\nscreams at the end of the furious\n\u2018Reference Point Zero\u2019 to the soft\nFuture\nof the\nLeft have\ngenerated\na reputaion\nfor absurd\nlyrics\nshows that Pitchfork would label as\nincendiary.

It\u2019s not like streaming services\nare actually distinguishable in\nfunctionality in any meaningful way.\nThe overlap in content between the\nmain services (Google Play Music,\nApple Music, Spotify and TIDAL)\nis so massive that the only incentive\nthese companies can come up for\nconsumers to switch to their services\nis to provide exclusive albums and in\nmost cases this exclusivity is only for\na limited time.\nCompare this to video streaming\nservices, where each provider offers\ndrastically different content, or\nvideo game consoles, where systems\nvary in power and there are frequent\nconsole-exclusive titles, and it\u2019s\nobvious that we\u2019re being played.\nIt\u2019s hard to blame the musicians\nwho have stakes in TIDAL \u2013\nthey\u2019re trying to make money in a\nprecarious music industry. But in\nmany cases when they make things\nexclusive, rather than getting new\ncustomers to join their service\nthey\u2019re forcing consumers back to\nillegally download albums again\n(which streaming services were\ncreated to prevent). No one is\ngoing to subscribe to every music\nservice just to listen to every album\nthat\u2019s released; they\u2019re going to\ncomplement their music streaming\nwith pirating.\nIf you by into all that capitalism\nbullshit then I guess competition\ncan sometimes be great.\nMaybe this model of exclusivity\nis working for companies, but\nit\u2019s certainly not working for\nconsumers. Welcome to the world\nof virtually identical streaming\nplatforms, where the crossover of\ncontent is probably higher than\n90%, and where as a result we all\nlose out. Some musicians are now\nmore businessperson than artist.Art\nshould be for everyone, not for the\nfew who are silly enough to pay for\nthree streaming subscriptions.\nclean singing on \u2018No Son Will\nEase their Solitude\u2019, Falco\u2019s vocals\nprovide wonderful hooks \u2013 hooks\nthat are especially welcome on the\nmore alienating tracks on the album.\nAltogether The Peace and Truce of\nFuture of the Left is probably one of\nFotL\u2019s most accessible and varied\nreleases, combining the elements\nthat make them so interesting and\nrewarding to listen to from their\nprevious albums with new twists\nand quirks creating a really deep\nrewarding album.\n\n"

Mine would definitely\nbe the traditional English\nafternoon tea. Probably the same as\nany typical Chinese girl.\nDo not let the idea of afternoon\ntea scare you \u2013 this is going to be\na casual affair, no extravagance,\nno posh British accents, no jaw-dropping bills. I promise.\nThe Muffin Man Tea Shop is\nsituated down the quiet Wrights\nLane, just around the corner\nfrom High Street Kensington\nunderground station. Small, old-fashioned, dimly lit, with black and\nwhite photos on the walls, a counter\nwith a Victoria sponge, shortbread\nand many other sweet delights.\nImagine visiting your grandmother.\nI always come here for the Devon\nCream Tea. Two scones served with\nclotted cream, strawberry jam and a\npot of tea of your choice. And yes,\na delicate, white china teacup on a\nsaucer. How much more British can\none get?\nDon\u2019t expect the tea to be any\ndifferent from your usual Tetley, or\nthe jam to be superior to that 75p\njar from Tesco. It is not about the\ntea, or the jam. It\u2019s all about the\nscones.\nYes, the scones. You are about to\ntaste the best scones in the whole of\nLondon.\nAt this stage I wouldn\u2019t argue\nabout whether the jam goes first, or\nthe cream. It doesn\u2019t matter. We can\nargue about etiquette or viscosity\nor aesthetics later. Just shut up,\nsmother it with any ratio of cream\nto jam, and eat.\nThe scones are hot and toasted,\nwith a slightly dry crunch on the\nedges yet retaining this wonderful\nmoisture and softness inside. The\nhint of buttery flavours merges\nperfectly with the smooth clotted\ncream and jam.\nIn case you are still feeling a bit\npeckish, have a look at their equally\nBritish menu \u2013 Coronation chicken\nsalad or a rarebit?\nScones and tea. The perfect\noccasion on a sunny afternoon to sit,\nrelax, and of course, to feel perfectly\nBritish.\nOn a final note: clotted cream\ngoes first.\nThe challenge used to be how much jam you could fit on. Clearly, times have changed. Photo Credit: Christy Lam\nDo not let\nafternoon\ntea scare\nyou\nScones with fresh butter,\nand quick \u201cjam\u201d\nA\ns Christy says \u2013 what\ncould be more classically\nEnglish than scones\n(tea, the queen and\ninstitutionalised pig-fucking didn\u2019t\nmake the cut)? Personally, I always\nassociate scones with my slightly\nfrazzled mother hurriedly making a\nbatch of them \u2013 either for her stitch\n\u2018n\u2019 bitch (the so called \u201cwimmins\ngroup\u201d), book group or the\nunexpected arrival of a guest! Still,\nthey were always delicious \u2013 and in\nour house, it was always real butter\n(a treat from the usual margarine)\nwith jam, though clotted cream was\noccasionally proffered.\nAll three components \u2013 the hot,\ncrisp scones, rich butter and sweet\njam \u2013 are actually quite simple to\nmake,and keep well.So,if you fancy\nmaking some on for a Sunday picnic\nin the park, don\u2019t worry \u2013 they can\nall be made on the Saturday before,\nand kept. Take some rose cava, a\ncomfy blanket, and a condom.\nThe scone recipe is my mother\u2019s\n\u2013 and it\u2019s a pretty traditional\none, though some plebs insist\nthat currants (or \u201craisins\u201d \u2013 never\nsultanas) do not belong in scones.\nThey are wrong.\nIf you haven\u2019t had fresh butter\nbefore, this really is a huge treat\n\u2013 it\u2019s so different from the highly\nprocessed cheap Lurpak that many\nof you might be familiar with.Make\nsure to buy real cream, and not\nElmlea \u2013 it\u2019s a cream substitute and\nwill not work!\nFor the \u201cjam\u201d, don\u2019t be as picky\nwith fruit, as it will work well\nwith anything from strawberries,\nraspberries and redcurrants, with\nthe first two starting to come into\nseason now. The appropriate term\nfor it would really be a compote, as\nit won\u2019t fully set.\nScones:\n250g self-raising flour\n1 rounded tsp baking powder\n30g caster sugar\n40g softened butter\n75g currants\n1 egg\n100ml milk\nPreheat the oven to 190\u00b0C fan.\nMix all the dry ingredients apart\nfrom the currants together,and chop\nin the butter. Crumble together\nwith your hands \u2013 a food processor\ndoes this very quickly but is also a\nbugger to clean.\nAdd the currants, and mix in\nevenly.Whisk the egg with the milk,\nand incorporate into the mixture \u2013\nyou may need a touch more milk.\nThe mixture should be quite dry.\nRoll out the mixture to ~2cm\nthick,and use a water glass (or fluted\nring cutter) to cut out scones. I do\nmine about 6cm across. Re-roll the\nscraps, and repeat \u2013 there\u2019s always\none dodgy looking one at the end.\nPlace on a floured baking tray, and\nplace in the oven for 8-10 minutes\nuntil risen and golden brown.\nButter\n300ml double cream\nFlake salt\nPour the cream into a jar,and screw\nthe lid on tight.Shake like crazy! It\u2019s\nvery good forearm exercise, though\nmost of you should have no problem\nwith that.After 5-10 minutes,you\u2019ll\nsee golden flakes appear that will\neventually accumulate into a nice\nclump of butter.\nPut into a sieve to drain briefly\n(the liquid is buttermilk, which can\nbe used for baking) and then in the\nfridge to set. Once slightly firmer,\nsprinkle with the salt\nCompote\n250g soft fruit \u2013 whatever is in\nseason, see above \u2013 with stems\nremoved, sliced.\nSqueeze of lemon juice\nSugar, to taste\nSimply add the fruit and lemon\njuice to a pot and simmer gently on\nthe stove until they break down.This\nshouldn\u2019t take too long. Add sugar\nto taste, stirring to dissolve, and\nleave on the heat, stirring regularly,\nuntil it thickens a touch. Pour into a\nsmall, clean jar, and refrigerate.\nChristy Lam\nWriter\nSanjay Bhattacharya\nFood Editor\nThis is almost good enough for mother. Photo Credit: Wikicommons\nGo-nuts for doughnuts\nFELIX presents your guide to the best doughnuts in London\nT\nhrowback to the seven\nyears spent in an all-girls\nboarding school in the\ncountryside. A weekend\ntrip to the nearest town with an\nactual supermarket was a sacred\nprivilege only to those of Year 9 and\nabove, while you have to be at least\nin Year 12 to be allowed to step on\nthe train on the opposite platform\nto London.\nStrict rules applied: we had to\nfill in a so-called \u201cexeat form\u201d days\nprior to departure,then get it signed\non time by the Housemistress. We\nchecked out, left school on Saturday\nnoon,came back no later than 17:00\non the dot to check back in and our\nbags search for alcohol or cigarettes.\nTrips on Sundays were considered as\n\u201cspecial cases\u201drequiring a legitimate\nreason for the need to do so.By Year\n13, this procedure felt rather like\ninmates applying for furlough.\nAnother precious memory\nof those innocent days is an\nunbelievable infatuation with Krispy\nKremes. Back then, they were a rare\ncommodity, highly sought after\nespecially by the younger years, and\nonly available during the occasional\ncharity fundraising. Long queues\nformed outside the English\nclassroom with crowd control. 20\ndozen Original Glaze sold out\nfaster than the blink of an eye.\nI too, lived in the craze, jotting\ndown its planned trade date as soon\nas it was made known to the public\nafter prayers on Monday mornings.\nEven made up the most ridiculous\nexcuses to nip out from class five\nminutes early to beat the queue.\nAnd now, in 2016, after two\nodd years in civilisation will I still\nbe that obsessed with them as my\n13-year-old self? Of course not.\nOne look at that poor girl\nfundraising for charity holding\nthat familiar green-dotted-on-white box approaching me from 30\nmetres away would have me turning\nimmediately on my heels and\ndashing off in the exact opposite\ndirection. An unexpected approach\nwould be dealt with with a good ten\nsecond hesitation, with my mind\nentirely blanked out and extreme\ntension building up inside similar to\nanswering the winning question in\nWho Wants to be a Millionaire: a)\naccept the doughnut, b) decline the\ndoughnut, c) pretend you are deaf\nand blind, d) run.\nMost of the time I\u2019d kindly decline\nthe sugared ring while offering\nto donate the exact price. Plonk\nas the coin hits the bottom of the\nplastic bucket.The reason behind\nthe disappearance of love for Krispy\nKremes? Because there are far, far\nbetter doughnuts in this world.\n1.The Classic\nThe joy of biting into a doughnut\ncompletely and symmetrically filled\nto the top with perfectly smooth\nvanilla custard cream. The days\nof disappointment from stingy\nfillings are forever gone with St\nJohn\u2019s Bakery and Bread Ahead\nBakery. Both are excellent local\nbakeries producing all sorts of\ntop-notch baked goods everyday\nincluding a wide variety of pastries\nand sourdough. Doughnuts are\ntheir popular specialty with some\nbasic flavours in common: vanilla\ncustard, honeycomb, raspberry jam,\nchocolate.\nBread Ahead explores slightly\nfurther with flavours depending\non the season, such as blackberry\ncustard ripple, salted caramel with\nhoneycomb and my favourite \u2013\nearl grey with soaked prune (all\n\u00a32.50). The doughnut itself is like\na brioche and is dusted with white\nsugar. St John\u2019s Bakery is available\nfrom their bakeries in Druid Street\nMarket, Maltby Street Market,\nSpitalfields and the Food Hall at\nSelfridges. Bread Ahead opens their\nstore at Borough Market and Old\nSpitalfields Market on select days.\n2.The Sourdough\nProbably should have called this\ncategory \u201cGourmet\u201d \u2013 Crosstown\nDoughnuts boasts of their hand\nmade, hybrid sourdough base\nclaiming to reduce the sweetness\nand to not absorb as much fat when\ndeep fried. Their layers of icing on\ntop definitely helped a great deal too.\nIn reality, they have a slightly firmer\nand chewier texture compared to\nthe conventional doughnut. Their\nrange of unique and unimaginable\nflavours is the selling point: granola\nand strawberry jam, PB&J, sea\nsalt caramel banana (\u00a33 - \u00a33.50).\nFind them in their flagship store in\nSoho, their little black van at Old\nSpitalfields Market, WholeFoods,\nSelfridges and various independent\ncafes across London.\n3.The Cronut\nAll hail Dominique Ansel \u2013 the\ncreator of the Cronut\u2122. The chef\nand owner of Dominique Ansel\nBakery in New York \u2013 the patisserie\nwhose creations took the world by\nstorm. Expect to join the queue at\n6am, two hours before the shop\nopens. Lucky for us, three bakeries\nhave come up with something\nalong the same lines as the real\ndeal. Dum Dum Donutterie in Box\nPark Shoreditch and Brick Lane\npresents their iconic Cro in Zebra\n(chocolate),strawberry & cream and\nCronutella. Distinct layers of pastry\nfilled with buttercream, toppings\nand dunked in sugar (\u00a33).The range\nis also available at Harrods (\u00a34.50).\nMeanwhile Rinkoff Bakery,\nthe 105-year-old family run\nbusiness in Whitechapel, has their\npopular Crodough with a lot less\nbuttercream and sugar compared\nto the former in a wider variety of\nflavours. Think Oreo Cheesecake,\nPB&J and S\u2019mores, and a special\nCr\u00e8me Egg Crodough during\nEaster (all \u00a32.50). If Whitechapel\nis too far a journey, find them at\nSelfridges and Timberyard.\nLast but not least \u2013 Cocomaya in\nMarble Arch presents their elegant\ntake in their CocoDough available\nin salted caramel, Red Velvet,\nstrawberry, chocolate and vanilla\n(all \u00a33.25).\n4.The Duffin\nIf a doughnut and a muffin had\na child, what would it be called?\nA Duffin.No joke. This doughnut-muffin hybrid was invented by Beas\nof Bloomsbury in 2013 and created\na huge fuss back then, including\ncontroversywithStarbucksoverwho\nactually created this Frankenstein in\nthe first place.\nEnough of law suits. Beas still\nhave their Duffin game going strong\nselling in their cafes at Bloomsbury,\nSt Paul\u2019s and Farringdon. It is\nessentially a dense buttermilk cake\nthe size of your palm, flavoured\nwith nutmeg, dipped in butter,\nrolled in sugar then piped with jam\nor Nutella (\u00a32.50).\n5.The Cruffin\nOn the subject of portmanteau\npastries, allow me to introduce\nyou to the Cruffin. Originating\nfrom Mr Holms Bakehouse in San\nFrancisco, the croissant pastry is\nbaked in a muffin mould instead\nof its usual lunar shape, then filled\nwith custard to the brim, dusted\nwith sugar and there you have it \u2013\nthe Cruffin. Cocomaya in Marble\nArch does a breath-taking version\nin chocolate, strawberry, caramel\ncheesecake and blueberry. The\ncustard cream is smooth and light\nyet rich in flavour. The delicate\nlayers of pastry maintained a\nperfect balance of crispiness and\nmoisture \u2013 imagine the freshly\nheated up pastries at the Library\nCaf\u00e9 in the morning.Their caf\u00e9 has\na limited supply of them everyday,\nbut Selfridges always has a not-so-secret stash in the Food Hall.\nCHRISTY LAM\nCW from top left: nutella duffin, earl grey with soaked prune, apple crumble,\nsalted caramel cheesecake cruffin.

But given\nthe mutability of morality and\nethical stances across cultures,\nindividuals, and time, it\u2019s difficult\nto pinpoint where the lines of what\nis moral should be drawn. What\nof the devastating effects of the\nManhattan Project, the morals of\nwhich physicist Richard Fenyman\nhad always been fairly tight-lipped\nabout? Was it wrong to pursue the\ndevelopment of our capability to\nsplit atomic nuclei even though the\nscientists knew it would be used for\napplication on humans? Or what of\nthe endless case of the anti-vaxxer,\nin which the scientific community\nhas decided that individual consent\nis irrelevant in light of the greater\nsocial good? These are complex\nissues with no easy answer, but are\ndearly worth considering in our\nown endeavours.\nScientists often take a class\nin ethics at some point in their\neducation, and there are many\nethical forms one can fill out and\nclear in the pursuit of their research.\nBut ultimately, it\u2019s an odd mix of\nwhat the individual scientist and\ninstitutions are willing to research\nand practice, paired with what the\nlarger scientific community agrees\nis acceptable, and is in periodic\nresponse to some social pressures.\nInterestingly enough, some have\neven argued that science \u2013 aiming\nat objectivity, knowledge, and truth\n\u2013 could actually act as a beacon to\ndetermine what our human morals\nshould be, and help us figure out\nwhat is right or wrong. This flies\nin the face of those who value\nneutrality as a core tenet of scientific\nendeavours.\nRegardless,like a carefully planned\ngame of chess,scientists should look\nahead to the possible implications\nof their research and decide if the\noutcomes are worth the pursuit. I,\nfor one, certainly don\u2019t believe any\nknowledge is inherently bad in and\nof itself, but that its application\ncan nonetheless be used to hinder\nor help humanity. As we transition\nfrom our studies into research,\ndevelopment, and application, we\nshould all aim to use science as a\ntool of progress and development,\nthough inevitably, what that means\nis constantly and vaguely in flux.\nNAOMI STEWART\nYes, we chose a psychedelic cat for this piece. You\u2019re welcome. Photo Credit: John Lecster\nScience, what\u2019s good?\nExciting research from NASA\u2019s\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, in\nCalifornia, suggests Europa, one\nof Jupiter\u2019s 67 moons may hide an\nocean that is chemically similar to\nEarth\u2019s. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with\nthe alien moon, know that it is\nslightly smaller than our moon, and\nis considered one of the smoothest\nsolid objects in our solar system,\nwhich has led scientists to believe it\nhides an ocean beneath its surface.\nIt is this element that suggests\nthat despite its lack of volcanic\nactivity, Europa could be host to\nlife. Europa\u2019s rocky interior reacts\nwith the seawater producing new\nminerals and releasing hydrogen.\nThis hydrogen reacts with molecules\nreleased from the pounding of the\nicy surface by Jupiter\u2019s radiation,\nreleasing oxidants. If the moon is\ndead inside (has no volcanic core)\nit might allow for just the right\nchemical balance to support life.\nPlans for future missions are being\nmade that will hopefully shed more\nlight.\nVance et al. 2016, Geophysical\nResearch Letters\nLef Apotolakis\nScience Editor\nIn more \u2018breaking news\u2019, a recent\nstudy showed that financial support\nreally helps students with learning\ndisabilities to complete assignments\nand get extra support from faculty,\noutside of teaching hours.The study\nlooked at university students in\nthe US with learning disabilities:\ncomparing those receiving special\naccommodation, with those less\nfortunate. However, the study also\nsuggested that affluence of students\nplayed a key role in their likelihood\nof receiving additional support.\nWealthier students struggling\nwith learning disabilities tended\nto receive support more often than\nlow-income students. The pattern\nwas also reflected in comparison\nwithout-of-state students, who\ngenerally pay higher tuition fees\nthan in-state students and are more\nlikely to be better off, financially. A\npossible explanation is that receiving\nsupport is subject to providing\nadequate proof, which requires tests\nthat cost money to take. Long story\nshort: money makes life easier.\nMcGregor et al. 2016, Learning\nDisabilitier Research & Practice\nEarth-like sea\non Europa\nMoney helps\nwith learning!\nIt might come as a shock but\nwhen it comes down to maintaining\na happy relationship, it might\nbe about those on the outside of\nyour circle of trust, rather than\nthose on the inside.

Okay, maybe the study\ndidn\u2019t quite find that, but it might\nas well have. The study found that\nparticipants who were with partners\nless desirable than themselves were\nonly happy in their relationship if\ntheir partner was a closer match to\ntheir \u2018ideal\u2019 mate than most other\navailable mates. The only people\nthat didn\u2019t quite seem to care\nabout other potential mates were\nthose whose partners were more\ndesirable than themselves. Similarly,\nparticipants put in a lot more work\nin maintaining their relationship if\ntheir partner was \u201cjust too good to\nbe true\u201d.That\u2019s love for ya.\nConroy-Beam et al. 2016,\nEvolution and Human Behavior\nA new study creepily titled \u2018I\nknow where you live\u2019 showed that\nit\u2019s not only possible, but in fact\nrelatively easy to discover someone\u2019s\nhome and work addresses, simply\nby looking at the location stamps\nof their posts. The MIT researcher\nbehind the study followed\nthe activity of Twitter users in\nthe Boston area, and asked 45\nparticipants who had no particularly\nrelevant expertise to try and deduce\nwhat they could about the users.\nThe wannabe private eyes, managed\nto correctly pinpoint users\u2019 home\naddresses 65 percent of the time\nand work addresses as often as 75\npercent of the time. When provided\nwith additional data (a whopping\nfive days worth of tweets) accuracy\nof workplace geolocation climbed\nup to 85 percent. Participants\n\u2018shockingly\u2019 performed better when\nprovided with mapped data.

Alas,\nthe coating was destined for wind\nturbines, going through more\nthan 100 million testing cycles\nwithout showing any surface cracks\n(known as micropitting).The only\nproblem is that they are unable to\nunderstand how this coating works,\nso the scientists can\u2019t improve on it\nquite yet. Could be worse.\nSingh et al. 2016,Tribology\nInternational\nA break for\nwind power\nW\nith exams drawing\nnear, many think\nsetting aside time\nfor a dedicated\nworkout is simply not worth it.\nThe mere idea of walking to Ethos\nmakes you die a little inside. Longdrawn lectures and revision means\nthe treadmill is off the agenda on\nweekdays, so you settle for that walk\nto the library, the occasional sprint\nto the toilet. 30-minute run? Forget\nit \u2013 that would mean a shower,\nmakeup (hear hear, females), and\nthat would be your weekday or\nweekend evening gone. Friends,\nthere is a small saving grace.\nYou may have heard of the\nScientific Seven-minute Workout,\nand if you haven\u2019t, you\u2019ve probably\nheard of HIIT, otherwise known as\nhigh intensity interval training. But\nwhat exactly is this seven-minute\nspecialty?\nIt is, essentially, a workout that\nencompasses the benefits of HIIT\nin one lovely manageable burst,\nwith the most scientific data to back\nit up.I\u2019m one of the late ones on this\nhaving just recently discovered it in\nthe dusty corners of the Internet\n(circa 2014, would you believe it?).\nHIIT is a common method used to\nspike the metabolism,by alternating\nbetween intense bursts of exercise,\nand then less intense exercise or\ncomplete rest. By tapping quickly\ninto anaerobic reserves, it has been\nproven to increase endurance by at\nleast 11% after its incorporation\nthree times weekly, improve overall\ncardiovascular health, and believe it\nor not, increase production of the\nhuman growth hormone by up to\n450% during the 24 hours after your\nworkout.\nIts label,being what it is,prompted\nme to research the science behind\nthis phenomenon. All you need\nis a chair and a wall. The exercises\nthemselves are very simple, all of\nwhich everyone has tried before.\nCue pushups, jumping jacks, and\nchair step-ups. The sequence of\nexercises, that should be done with\nmaximum intensity and in rapid\nsuccession, are designed to increase\nfat oxidation capacity and boost\nyour metabolism like nothing else\nby the end of it. I do believe the\nlabel has been a little misinterpreted\nbecause there hasn\u2019t been a proper\nexperimental trial, though the\nbenefits of short, intense HIIT\nworkouts are sound, drastically\nimproving cardio-metabolic health\nand insulin sensitivity.\nHaving tried this myself recently,\nI can say I definitely felt its effects\nalmost immediately. If anything,\nseven minutes of HIIT gets your\nblood pumping, heart rate up, and\nmetabolism going. So if you\u2019re one\nof those who think a short run in\nHyde Park is the equivalent of\ndrawing blood from a stone on your\nhungover Saturday morning, I beg\nyou to rethink your fitness agenda.\nHere at Felix we believe in positive reinforcement, so have a cookie (or ten) for\nreading an article about exercise.

Psilocybin fungi\ngo by many names, but they\u2019re\nmore commonly known as magic\nmushrooms.These humble fungi are\npredominantly used recreationally\nas entheogens (what a word),\nsubstances that induce psychological\nor physiological changes, often used\nin a religious, or spiritual context.\nUsers claim they can induce\neuphoria, synesthesia, alter the way\nwe think and perceive time, and\ngenerally aid at the journey towards\ntranscendence. In other words\nthey\u2019re a hallucinogen that will send\nyou on a pretty psychedelic trip. All\nin all, there is general consensus\nthat shrooms are pretty strong stuff,\nwhich explains why they're illegal in\nmost countries around the world\nDespite many governments\u2019\n(including our own) strong nono stance on shrooms, research is\noccasionally green lit \u2013 some of it in\nour own back yard. Indeed, some of\nit takes place here at Imperial and\nit recently yielded results suggesting\nshrooms might be beneficial for\nthose struggling with depression.\nThe study, published in The Lancet\nPsychiatry, aimed at investigating\nwhether patients with depression,\ncould tolerate doses of psilocybin\nwithout exhibiting adverse side\neffects,such as anxiety and paranoia,\nwhich the UK government\nconsidered serious enough to\nwarrant a ban. The ban took effect\nwith the 2005 Drugs Act, which\nreclassified mushrooms as a class\nA drug, making possession a crime\nthat could induce a seven year\nprison sentence.\nThis is not the first time a\npsilocybin study has been conducted\nat Imperial. In 2014, research\nilluminated what areas of the brain\nare activated by shrooms and\nshowed that brains of users exhibit\nsimilar patterns to brains of people\nwho are dreaming. Patients with\nmoderate and severe depression\nwho are resistant to treatment\nvolunteered to receive Home\nOffice-approved psilocybin capsules\ntwice over seven days, as well as\nclose monitoring, not only during\nthe drug administration but also at\nregular intervals over the following\nfive weeks.\nResults showed a complete lack\nof adverse reactions (with the\nexception of anxiety right before the\ndrug administration, and at the very\nstart of the psychedelic experience,\nwhich is probably just a result of\nthe bad rep shrooms have) and also\na decrease of depression symptoms\nwhich, for a few patients, lasted to\nthe Department of Medicine at\nImperial College London, made\nreserved comments regarding\nthe research. \u201cPsychedelic drugs\nhave potent psychological effects\nand are only given in our research\nwhen appropriate safeguards are in\nplace, such as careful screening and\nprofessional therapeutic support.\nI wouldn't want members of the\npublic thinking they can treat their\nown depressions by picking their\nown magic mushrooms. That kind\nof approach could be risky.\u201d\nAlthough anticlimactic, his\nunder-enthused comments were\nprobably strategic rather than an\nhonest reflection of his excitement,\nconsidering Prof David Nutt\u2019s fate\nin 2009, which was sealed when he\nclaimed that tobacco and alcohol\nare in fact much more harmful than\nmany illegal drugs and suggested\nwhat some (Jacqui Smith)\nconsidered a radical reclassification.\nWhile Prof Nutt\u2019s outspokenness\ncost him his position as the\ngovernment\u2019s chief drug adviser, to\nthe public\u2019s dismay, Dr CarhartHarris has managed to stay on the\ngovernment\u2019s right side becoming,\nin 2014, the first scientist in over\n40 years to have been granted\npermission for testing LSD on\nhumans. The LSD study, which\nagain enlisted a number of\nvolunteers, used brain scanning to\nlook at how the brain works under\nthe psychedelic substance.The study\nshowed that under the influence,\nvolunteers used more areas of the\nbrain for visual processing than\nthey would normally and that the\ncompartmentalization of their brain,\nwhich usually allows different parts\nof the brain to perform separate\ntasks, broke down possibly causing\nthe phenomenon some people call\n\u2018ego-dissolution\u2019.\nIf you\u2019re wondering where this\nresearch is taking place and how to\nget involved, don\u2019t worry. So are we.\nsome extent for over three months.\nDespite the positive results,\nthe lead author of the study, Dr\nRobin Carhart-Harris, from\n\n"

Photo Credit: Youtube\nT\nhe recent election\nseason has got me in the\npolitical spirit, and I have\nbeen reminded of the\nshameful situation that continues\nto both bemuse and inflame me:\nthe Science and Technology\nSelect Committee. This grand,\nadministrative behemoth, whose\nexpansive remit covers everything\nfrom big data to genetics, with its\ncross-party composition and its\ninquiry-laden legislature, sets the\nnational agenda on science policy.\nIn a world where science policy is of\ngrowing importance, occupying all\nthe top spots on international issues,\nbe they climate change or viral\npandemics, the UK Government\nneeds to take leadership and forge\nthe path to a sustainable future.\nBut fear not, for who should chair\nthe Commons Select Committee\nfor Science and Technology? None\nother than Nicola Blackwood,\nan esteemed parliamentarian\nwith a doctorate in \u2013 wait for\nit \u2013 musicology. It sounds like\nsomething out of a Mitchell and\nWebb sketch, only the reality is far\nless funny. Indeed, of the eleven\nMPs that comprise this essential\nfacet of Government, only seven\nhave graduated from a university\nand a whopping four have a science\ndegree.\nThis probably doesn\u2019t surprise you;\nthe British Government\u2019s lack of\nscientists is not news.The last time I\nrecall a scientist being involved with\npolitics, it was 2009, when Professor\nDavid Nutt was sacked after\npublishing a scientific paper into\nthe social harms of illicit drugs.This\nnot only demonstrates the anaemic\nquantities of scientific rationale\nin government, but that no major\nscientist has taken the political stage\nfor seven years.\nFor once, perhaps, this second\npoint is not down to faults of the\ngovernment or an incompetent\npolitician, but is a sad reflection of a\nglobal scientific consensus: political\napathy.\nMaybe it is the lack of objectivity\nthat comes with policymaking, or\nthe narrow-focused research mindset that is instilled in students from\nthe start, but the trend is clear:\nscientists don\u2019t care.\nEven here at Imperial College\nLondon, an institution with some\nof the sharpest young minds on the\nplanet, we have a student Labour\nNo major\nscientist\nhas taken\nthe political\nstage for\nseven years\nParty Society that was almost shut\ndown last year due to a lack of\nmembers (and committee), and\nour own student think tank that no\none has heard of. There are plenty\nof reasons why Imperial students\nmight be less politically active than\nour university counterparts, but\nexplaining away our predicament\ndoes not solve anything.\nWith the possible exception of the\naspiring bankers, Imperial students\nare entering careers whose funding\nand regulations are governed by\npeople who couldn't tell you the\ndifference between a proton and a\nprotein.\nSo why haven\u2019t our science and\ntechnology industries collapsed into\npandemonium? Well, fortunately,\nsome our MPs became painfully\naware of this gaping qualification\ngap, and so set up the Parliamentary\nOffice for Science and Technology\n(POST) back in 1989, to research\nand brief MPs on scientific issues\nof the day. Initially staffed by one\nresearcher, the humble institution\nrepresented how small the realm\nof science policy was but a mere 30\nyears ago.\nBut much has since changed, and\ntoday POST has a larger executive\nboard than the entire Commons\nSelect Committee for Science and\nTechnology, its own Fellowship\nprogramme and briefs both Houses\nof Parliament.\nMany do not have a problem with\nthis set up, but the fact that we\nhave to introduce an undemocratic\nWe need a\nparliament\nproperly\narmed with\nscientists\ninstitution to compensate for the\nshortage of scientists in parliament\nspeaks volumes. Few in this country\nhave the scientific know-how to\nunderstand the implications of\nthe UK\u2019s science policy, and those\nwho do, don\u2019t vote. This is not just\na British problem; global science\npolicy increasingly relies on a few\nvoices of undemocratic research\norganisations for guidance. These\nviews do not represent broad\nnational perspectives and instead\nhide behind the veil of objectivity at\nthe cost of our democracy.\nAs our species makes strides in\nscience and technology like never\nbefore, we need now, more than\never, a democratic machine to\nfairly govern this new world. We\nneed a parliament properly armed\nwith scientists, a population ready\nto criticise them and a national\nvoice prepared to debate them.\nInstead, we are sleepwalking into\ntechnocracy, bestowing control of\nthe fastest growing and increasingly\nimportant policy area on unelected,\nfaceless institutions.\nApathy has consequences.\nScientists and students alike have\nlong been silent voices on the\npolitical stage, and as a result,\ngovernments have turned elsewhere\nfor guidance. Whilst it may be\neasier to try and opt out of the\nsystem, become disenfranchised\nand complain that it's all rigged, it\nis vital that you find the courage to\nengage head-on with democracy\nwhilst we still have it. Citizenship\nis not a part-time job; if you\u2019re\nunhappy with policy, at any level,\nwrite to your local councillor, visit\nyour MP, or best of all, reflect your\ndissatisfaction at the ballot box. If\nyou don\u2019t engage, politicians won\u2019t\ntry and win you over.\n\n"

A Lord that won\u2019t try to use me!\u201d Photo Credit: HBO\nHarry Wilkinson\nWriter\nA\nthird of the way through\nthe season and it\u2019s really\nstarting to get going.We\npick up at theWall where\nJon apparently had to pop back into\nCastle Black after storming off last\nepisode (\u201cJon you\u2019ll need a coat! You\nof all people should know winter is\ncoming!\u201d). We then get the first of\nthe episode\u2019s many reunions when\nSansa and Jon meet for the first time\nsince back at the start of Season one.\nThey have a really heart-warming\nscene reminiscing about Winterfell\nand Sansa attempts to convince\nJon to take it back from Ramsay.\n(\u201cHey brother I used to be a dick\nto! Wanna go murder my ex?\u201d).\nBrienne also walks over to Davos\nand Mel just to let them know that\nshe murdered Stannis, the man they\ngave their lives to. She\u2019s not the best\nat making friends, is she?\nWe then head back to the Vale (get\nyour maps out, folks) where Irish\nBatman (or Littlefinger,as he prefers\nto be called) drops in to threaten an\nold man then manipulate a teenager.\nStandard Littlefinger stuff really,\nnot sure that even he knows exactly\nwhat the plan is there.\nTyrion\u2019s scene was a great return\nto the diplomacy from season two,\njust in Meereen. Turns out, no\nmatter where you are, you can get\nahead in negotiations by employing\nprostitutes. Take notes business\nstudents. There were hints of the\nformer slaves being unhappy about\nthe terms that were reached but\nwe\u2019ll just have to wait and see how\nthis turns out for the dwarf and\neunuch (isn\u2019t that the name of a\npub?).\nplan.\nWe then return to King\u2019s Landing\nand it\u2019s Margaery\u2019s turn to appear\non the High Sparrow\u2019s talk show.\nThey have a bit of bible study\nbefore he begins reminiscing about\nsome orgy he went to a while ago\nafter he made some bitching shoes\nand sends Margaery to speak with\nLoras. He\u2019s completely broken at\nthis point; apparently there\u2019s torture\nworse than getting read to by a nun.\nCersei asks Tommen what the\nold man has been telling him and\nTommen says he promised not to\ntell his parents. Nothing odd there.\nCersei and Jaime storm into the\nsmall council chambers to plot with\nthe Tyrells to overthrow the Faith\nMilitant and save Margaery before\nshe has to repeat Cersei\u2019s walk of\nshame. I\u2019m not entirely sure that\nIncest Team Rocket can be trusted\non this one; Cersei doesn\u2019t seem too\nworried about the upcoming Trial\nis appreciated anyway.\nDarth Ramsay has a quick scene\nwhere a woman tries to have sex\nwith him and then he stabs her in\nthe throat. I can\u2019t imagine Osha\u2019s\nactress was thrilled getting her\nscript for this season\nAfterwards, we head back to\nCastle Black to a meal fraught with\nsexual tension between Brienne and\nTormund with Edd looking on with\nan expression of horror. A Bolton\nman arrives with a letter for Jon. To\nparaphrase; \u201cCome at me bro, I\u2019m\nproper mental. P.S. Gimme my wife\nback\u201d. Ramsay was never one for\nsubtlety. Tormund then pledges the\nWildling army to help Jon.\nFor the episode\u2019s finale, we head\nback to Vaes Dothrak where Dany\nis under judgment. The Dothraki\ncontinue to, surprisingly, be the\ncomic relief, having a couple of\ngreat lines. For the trial, however,\nDany\u2019s not the most diplomatic sort\nso her idea of a defence argument is\ncalling the judges a bunch of pussies\nand setting the courthouse on fire.\nShe then strolls out and welcomes\nthe gathered horde bowing to her. I\nguess she\u2019s a big believer in \u2018If it ain\u2019t\nbroke don\u2019t fix it\u2019.\nCertainly the best of the season\nso far, this episode had a big theme\nof reunions and brother sister team\nups. It also really got things moving\nin many of the storylines that had\nbeen treading water a bit, it really is\nstarting to feel like we\u2019re building\nup to the finale now.\nGame of Thrones is available on\nHBO Go\nSuper Daario and Jorah the\nExplorah have an argument about\nwho\u2019s going to bang Dany before\nfinding Vaes Dothrak and sneaking\nin unarmed. Except Daario stashed\na knife. It\u2019s just who he is. We get\nanother quick scene of Dany in the\nbingo club before she storms out,\nfinding the boys and hatching a\nby Combat so there\u2019s not much gain\nfor her in this deal as far as I can see.\nAnother return to the Iron Isles\nwith Theon. Yara makes a couple\nof dick jokes at his expense before\nhe makes her feel bad by crying\nand pledging to help her become\nQueen at the Kingsmoot. I\u2019m not\ntoo sure what a tortured, cockless\nguy with missing fingers can do to\nhelp exactly but I\u2019m sure the gesture\nThis\nepisode had\na big theme\nof reunions\nand brother\nsister\nteam ups\nTyrion\u2019s\nscene was\na great\nreturn to the\ndiplomacy\nfrom season\ntwo\n\n"

I was inspired\nand captivated by the enormous\nrange of research and innovation\nthat I was able to discuss in detail\nwith students, researchers and\nprofessors who were all passionate\nabout what they were doing and\nkeen to share their thinking. What\na privilege!\nWhilst there I picked up FELIX\n(Issue 1633); the centre-fold made\nme gasp in horror and then brought\nme close to tears. I was a student\nin Electrical Engineering from\n1977-80. At that time there were\n5% women across Imperial College,\nwith fewer in engineering. As\nHon Sec and then President of\nC&G Union, I worked in every\nway possible to help retain current\nfemale students and attract new\nfemale students. In this context,\nC&GU actively challenged all\nsexist representation of women\nand activities and \u201ctraditions\u201d that\ndegraded women. IC Union also\nmade its voice heard on many issues\nof national policy and practice that\ndiscriminated against women.\nI presume the IC netball team\nchose to attract teams for their\ntournament in this way but I ask\nthem why they would want to\npresent their bodies rather than\ntheir netballing skills. And why\nwould FELIX want to encourage\nthem in this? I ask you all to think\nabout the message you are giving to\nfemale peers who doubtless rebuff\nunwanted sexual comment and\nharassment daily; the message you\nare giving to male peers who are\nagain being invited to look at women\nas objects for their gratification; the\ncontribution you are making to\nthe pressures on young women to\ncompete through their looks rather\nthan their achievements.\nIt was noticeable that, amongst\nall the wonderful IC people I spoke\nto, women were extremely under-represented. It was also noticeable\nthat visitors were predominantly\nmen and boys. Imagine a young\ngirl, wondering about a future in\nscience or engineering, opening\nyour newspaper at the centre spread.\nWill it invite her into the exciting\nworld you have chosen? You can -and should - do better than this.\nJo Armitage\nEEE, 1977-80\n(via email)\nI understand where you\u2019re\ncoming from. However, I do not\nbelieve these pictures are sexual.\nI have never published a sexual\ncentrefold.I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the\nfilm Calendar Girls \u2013 the nudity in\nour centrefolds is always along\nthose lines: fun, non-sexual and\nsilly. There is no obligation to be\nfully naked, and no one in the club\nis forced to take part.\nAlso, male students are often\nin the centrefold, both in sports\nteams and mixed groups.\nThe idea that we as women can\u2019t\nbe naked in centrefolds and also\nbe free to rebuff unwanted sexual\nadvances is terribly worrying and\nfrankly, sad. If men see women\nin the centrefold and think\nthey\u2019re easy \u2018objects\u2019 available for\nharassment, then the fault lies\nwith those men. This attitude of\npolicing women\u2019s bodies, deciding\nwhat is liberating or appropriate\nfor them to show or hide for\ntheir own \u2018good\u2019 is bullshit.\nFemSoc\u2019s centrefold (Issue 1631)\nis particularly hard-hitting, and\nraises the issues of sexism,rape and\ngender. There are plenty of ways\nfor clubs to promote themselves\nin FELIX \u2013 the Clubs & Societies\npages, sport \u2013 and the centrefold is\njust one of those. Many clubs, with\nboth male, female and non-binary\nmembers, would release naked\ncalendars anyway, even if FELIX\ndidn\u2019t have a centrefold. These are\nusually fun, and always for charity.\nOur newspaper does not exist\nto engage young girls wandering\nround the Imperial festival. It is\nmade by students, for students,\nand forever may it remain.\n-Ed.\nIn response to Issue 1633\nCentrefold (netball)\nDear FELIX\nI attended the IC Festival last\nweekend it was a fantastic event.\nThe inspiration it provided in all\nfields was exciting.\nBut I was completely horrified\nwhen I picked up a copy of FELIX\n1633 in the cafe. What on earth was\nthe thinking behind that centrefold\nof the netball team? And this in the\nsame issue as an article about sexual\nharassment. I thought we only got\nthose sorts of mixed messages in The\nSun!\nThere are few enough women\nworking and studying in the\nsciences \u2013 what sort of message\ndoes that kind of imagery send out\nto young women and girls who may\nbe thinking of studying at Imperial?\nI truly would like to know what\nthe intentions and thinking behind\nthat photo were and why FELIX\nthought it a suitable advertisement\nfor women at Imperial.\nJulie Peel\n(via email)\nThe netball team were behind\nwhat I thought was a cute, fun,\nand again, non-sexual photo,\npromoting their tournament.\nFELIX isn\u2019t meant to be an advert\ntostudyatImperial.Thecentrefold\nis one way for students to advertise\nevents to other students.\nThe fact that you\u2019ve brought up\nthe cat-calling article is deeply\nworrying to me. Should its writer\nexpect sexual harassment if she\nhad appeared in the centrefold?\nShould she expect it if she was a\nfully fledged page three model? Do\neither of these things means she's\nasking for it? No.\n-Ed.\nIn response to, well, nothing\nHey hallmates! Like you, I'm so\nhappy that the year's nearly over.\nIt's time to relax, unwind and\nexorcise those pent-up impulses.\nNevertheless, the last few end-of-terms have gotten a bit out of hand,\nand I've been left verklempt by some\nbaffling behaviour. I'm writing here\nto tell you what's hot and what's\nnot so that we can all still be super-besties!\nI love parties as much as anyone.\nThey last to 3am, the volume's on\nfull-blast and the drinking games\ninvolve Stolichnaya and gummy\nbears!\nWho doesn't love that? At the\nend of the night (or start of the day,\ndepending on how wild you are),\nyou'll get back to your room and\nreturn to humdrum civilian life.\nFor some low-energy people,\nthis might involve a collapse in the\ngeneral direction of the bed.\nFor the champions among us, you\nwill return to your room at 4:30am\nwith your new best friend, then\nafter forgetting protection, run up\nto my neighbour\u2019s door and yell\n\"[insert neighbour's name here]\nGIMME A CONDOM\". You will\noutdo yourself every time with your\ndog-yelping and epic fornications\nuntil dawn. Please do NOT stop;\nyour efforts help me to wake up for\nmorning lectures!\nNow when it comes time for\nbreakfast, I will stumble blearily\ninto the kitchen and find myself on\nthe set of Willy Wonka's office.\nHalf of the table will have\ndisappeared, having floated down\nfive flights of stairs to the common\nroom. It's a pretty cool party trick,\nbut it's actually really sad that noone else can witness the magic done\non their floors. My fine magician,\nyou have to consider their needs as\nwell!\nAnonymous\n(via email)\nUm, this is not what the letter\npages are for, but we hope your\npublic service announcement\nworks. You should probably find\na studio for next year, because\nnewsflash \u2013 this is what people are\nlike.\n-Ed.\nCentrefold complaints and halls drama\n\n"

She has a\nPhD in Chemistry from Mahidol\nUniversity, Bangkok.\nShe spoke about future\ncollaborations between Imperial and\nThailand, her own research and the\nimportance of research in general,\ncalling it \u201cthe key to everything\u201d.\nThe princess met professors from\nthe medical faculty\u2019s surgery and\ncancer department, the School of\nPublic Health and Electronical\nEngineering.\nSomeoftheprofessorsspoketothe\nprincess about Imperial\u2019s research\naround cholangiocarcinoma, a bile\nduct cancer that occurs at a high rate\ninThailand in particular.Khon Kaen\nUniversity Hospital is currently\nworking with a team at Imperial on\nadvanced imaging techniques in a\nbid to fight the disease.\nJames Stirling, the Provost, said:\nPrincess Chulabhorn has a Chemistry PhD\nThe\nprincess is\nwell known\nfor her keen\ninterest in\nscience and\nmedicine\n\u201cImperial College London is very\nproud of our links with Thailand\nboth through students and the\nresearch that we do together.

This is a\ncategory that Imperial would likely\nfall into, with the changes coming\ninto effect by autumn of 2017.\nThe proposals mean,at the current\nrate of 1.6% inflation (RPI), that\nstudents would pay an extra \u00a3144 a\nyear on top of your \u00a39000. Granted,\nthis is not massive in the grand\nscheme of things,but just as recently\nas 2011, inflation in the UK was\n5%, equating to \u00a3450 a year, sizable\nwhen you\u2019re on a 3/4/5+ year course.\nConmen drove the student to a cash point after meeting him outside Fisher\nO\nn Wednesday, a\nstudent was conned\ninto handing over cash\nto fraudsters outside\nFisher Hall in Evelyn Gardens.\nTwo men in a car, thought to be\nItalian, stopped the student outside\nthe halls of residence and asked him\nfor directions to the airport.\nThey got chatting, and persuaded\nthe student that they were fashion\ndesigners with leather jackets to\ngive away. The fraudsters told the\nstudent that they \u201cdidn\u2019t want to pay\ntax\u201d on the garments, and that he\ncould have them for free.\nThe men then somehow persuaded\nthe student that they were in need of\ncash to buy their children souvenirs.\nThe student got into their car, a\nwhite Audi, and they drove him to\na cash machine.\nAn attempt at the same con\noccurred outside Beit yesterday\ntoo, leading police to believe the\nfraudsters are particularly targeting\nImperial students. It\u2019s thought that\nthese con artists may be specivfically\ntargeting international students.\nThe warning from college is\nto immediately report to college\nsecurity or wardening staff if you\u2019re\nJo Johnson \u2013 who\u2019s raising fees, renaming Boaty McBoatface and being Boris\u2019 brother. Photo Credit: Wikipedia\nImperial College President, Alice\nGast, spoke out against the green\npaper that proposed this idea and\nseveral other initiatives, saying\nthat it is important to \u201cvoice our\nconcerns when we think that a\nproposed framework will inhibit or\ndiscourage excellence rather than\nsupport and reward it\u201d. The NUS\nhave also come out as staunch critics\nof the paper.\nIt\u2019s been argued by some that\nMatt Johnston\nNews Editor\nthe policy itself, the Teaching\nExcellence Framework, is the first\nstep on a slippery slope in which\ntuition fees for the top universities\ncould rise and rise at will.This could\neventually lead to an economic class\nsystem between universities.\nThe green and subsequent white\npapers are the brainchild of Jo\nJohnson, Boris\u2019s younger brother\nand the current Minister of State\nfor Universities and Science. Jo,\nwho attended Oxford University\nand studied Modern History, came\nunder fire earlier this month too,\nafter he oversaw the renaming of\nthe new Boaty McBoatface polar\nresearch ship to RSS Sir David\nAttenborough.\nFraudsters target students in scam outside halls\nBeware Evelyn Gardens at dusk.

Nintendo has been the sole\ntorchbearer in a genre which was\nonce the industry\u2019s most successful;\nit continues to produce quality and\ninnovative platformers while others\nhave almost abandoned the genre\ncompletely. Despite the critical (and\ncommercial flops) of recent releases\nin franchises like Ratchet & Clank,\nCrash Bandicoot, and Spyro, many\nstill remember these series fondly\n\u2013 even when they are undeserving.\nSociety is so obsessed with nostalgia\nthat we often misremember and\nignore flaws. However, in a rare\nfew cases the first games in these\nfranchises are deserving of praise.\nIn these cases we must ask the\nquestion: are these games only great\nwhen considered within the context\nof when they were released?\nVideo game companies have\nbegun in the last decade to exploit\nnostalgia by reimagining and\nrebooting series, in the hope that\ngamers will forget about previous\nmissteps. Ratchet & Clank is\ninteresting in that it is not only a\nreboot of the series (after more than\na dozen sequels), but a remaking\nof the original game. Without\nchanging much, Insomniac\u2019s\nthese two types of gameplay can be\nexhilarating and it creates the sense\nof being an action-hero far better\nthan other mature franchises do\ntoday.\nAfter only a few minutes with the\ngame, it is obvious that is more than\na HD remake; many elements of\nthe game have been changed. The\nmost obvious is the massive visual\noverhaul. Other than Uncharted\n4, no other game on PS4 is more\nvisually impressive. From the lush\nplanetscapes, with glistening vistas\non the horizon, to gloomy acidic\nunderworlds, every texture and\nmodel is polished and refined.\nRatchet & Clank is a furry\u2019s paradisse. Photo Credit: Insomniac Games, Inc\nOMG, it\u2019s so pretty. Photo Credit: Insomniac Games, Inc\nRatchet\u2019s fur and other similar\ngraphical details add up to create the\nbest looking platformer ever. This\nis proof a game doesn\u2019t have to be\nrealistic (or gritty) to be technically\nimpressive.\nTrying to explain this installment\nin the franchise to someone else\ncan get quite confusing. It\u2019s based\n(loosely) on a movie which is based\ncharacters are weird throwbacks\nto early noughties tropes (e.g. the\nskater dude) and the script is often\ngratingly cheesy especially when it\nbreaks the fourth wall. The story it\ntells is not particularly interesting,\nbut is told well.\nWhile a lot of original level\ndesigns have been reused, the\ndevelopers have added new worlds\nand gameplay sections to ensure it\ndoesn\u2019t feel too familiar to players of\nthe original. Clank\u2019s puzzle sections,\nwhere you control a number\nof different Gadgebots (each\nperforming a different purpose),\nprovide a refreshing change of pace\nfrom the action packed shooting\nof Ratchet, even if these levels\nare too easy. One notable new\nweapon turns enemies into pixels\nand the weapon system as a whole\nhas been overhauled adding more\ncustomisation to things like weapon\naccuracy, ammo capacity, and\ndamage.\nFor a game where very little has\nchanged, it feels incredibly modern.\nInsomniac have perfectly balanced\nthe new with the old. Rather\nthan relying solely on nostalgia,\nthey have made changes where\nappropriate and where the game\nwould have truly shown its age.\nMany were worried that Ratchet\nand Clank might not hold up after\n14 years of innovation, but it does.\nA franchise that was almost lost,has\nnow returned from the brink.\nRatchet & Clank is out now on PS4\nIt brilliantly\ncombines\nmelee and\nthird-person\nshooting\nmechanics\nFor a game\nwhere very\nlittle has\nchanged,\nit feels\nincredibly\nmodern\nreimagining of the original game\nfeels fresh. It is still as exciting as it\nwas all those years ago, a testament\nto the original release.\nWhile Nintendo platformers\nmight have revolutionised the\nenvironments players inhabit (Super\nMario Galaxy) and multiplayer\nfunctionality (New Super Mario\nBros.), the combat in their games\nhas changed very little. Many\nrightfully regard Ratchet & Clank\nas an action-platformer; it brilliantly\ncombines melee and third-person\nshooting mechanics. Traversing the\nenvironment and its obstacles is\nsimilar to any other 3D platformer,\nbut if you hold down the left trigger\nyou are able to enter a strafing\nmovement mode which is better\nsuited to combat (borrowing more\nfrom third-person shooters like\nGears of War). Switching between\non the original game (from 2002),\nand it includes some footage from\nthis film in between gameplay\nsegments. Insomniac are aware that\nthis is all a bit ridiculous, so have\nframed the game as a retelling of\nthe original by Captain Qwark. His\noften unreliable narration is amusing\nand is an attempt by the developers\nto fit this game into canon. Some\n\n"

Due to\ncome into law on May the 26th,\nit is a blanket ban on all \u2018mindaltering\u2019 substances, bar the ones\nwe know and love: alcohol, tobacco,\nnicotine, caffeine and some foods.\nThe vague terminology of the act is\na problem \u2013 testing everything for\n\u2018psychoactive\u2019 properties is going to\nbe difficult. Imperial\u2019s grandfather\nof drug reform and all round great\nguy Professor David Nutt told\nMotherboard he doesn\u2019t think it\nwill stem consumption. It will,\nhowever, affect the legality of study\ndrugs, which means they\u2019re about to\nbecome much harder to buy online.\nCurrently, lots of people buy their\nnootropics online, as you\u2019d expect.\nTheir status is a grey-area; they are\na semi-legal substance, meaning\ncustomers don\u2019t have to go via the\ndark web yet, and instead can buy\nRussian, Eastern European or\nIndian-made pills from British\ncompanies.

Unlike buying from your\nmate who has a prescription to treat\ntheir ADHD or narcolepsy however,\nthese substances are unregulated.\nBuying the off-brand drugs you see\non these sites isn\u2019t illegal right now,\nbut will be when the psychoactive\nsubstances blanket ban comes into\nforce. Some sites have seen a jump\nin sales, as people stock up before\nthe 26th\nof May.\nDo they work?\nModafinil, a prescription drug\nused to treat narcolepsy (which\ncauses excessive daytime sleeping),\nis the only study drug we know that\nis confirmed by the literature to\nenhance performance during long\ntasks. This 2015 study of studies\nalso found that mood-related and\nphysically unpleasant side effects\nwere found to be limited in most\nstudies, and were usually also found\nin the control group. However,\nmost studies on smart drugs\u2019\nperformance-enhancing abilities\nhave been on very small sample sizes.\nIt\u2019s generally a very unregulated\narea, so it\u2019s hard to say whether your\ngeneric \u2018Modalert 200\u2019 will actually\nmake you perform better.\nMany report vaguely positive\neffects when taken occasionally,\nbut some are unsure as to whether\nGrace Rahman\nEditor-in-Chief\nFELIX investigates study drugs\nLet\u2019s be realistic. Should you take them and are they legal?\n\u201cI took it a\nfew times.\nIt\u2019s helpful if\nyou want to\nconcentrate\non one\nthing in\nparticular.\u201d\nsuch as contraception. Modafinil\ncan harm an unborn foetus, and can\nalso stop the contraceptive pill from\nworking.If you can break away from\nrevising for long enough to have sex,\nbest use a condom.\nOne student told us: \u201cI\u2019m not sure\nif it\u2019s placebo or actually works but\nalmost all of my house took it. I\ntook it a few times, it\u2019s helpful if you\nwant to concentrate on one thing in\nparticular.\u201d\nWhat might happen?\nUnsurprisingly,these drugs are not\nconducive to getting a good seven\nhours the night before the exam.\nIf you\u2019re taking something like\nAdderall, you need to factor in the\nfact that you won\u2019t be sleeping for\nat least seven hours after you take it.\nFine if you want all-nighter, but be\ncareful because you might be forced\nto stay up all night, and wander into\nthe exam room looking like, well,\nsomeone who\u2019s stayed up all night in\nthe library after miscalculating their\nAdderall dose.\nFELIX has also heard horror\nstories involving students\naccidentally working intensely on\nthe wrong thing. You\u2019ll want to\nmake sure you have all the work you\nneed to do right in front of you when\nyou start, or you might find yourself\nspending seven hours rearranging\nyour bedroom or cleaning every\nutensil in the kitchen.That increased\nfocus can also mean you\u2019re less able\nto do basic things because you\u2019re so\ndistracted by the task at hand. Be\ncareful crossing roads,and definitely\ndon\u2019t start playing games on your\nphone \u2013 you won\u2019t be able to stop.\nHowever,legal drugs aren\u2019t the\nonly option \u2013 don\u2019t feel\nbad if the person\nnext to you has\nbeen typing\nsolidly for six\nhours while\nyou\u2019ve spent\nhalf of your\ntime on\nFa c e b o o k\n\u2013 they may\nwell be taking\nsome good old-fashioned speed.\nUnlike the other\ndrugs we\u2019ve discussed here,\nwhich are mainly available on\nprescription for disorders relating to\nlack of concentration, you are likely\nto experience a raging comedown\non speed. Don\u2019t expect that post-exam last week of term to be all\nrainbows and butterflies, because\nit\u2019ll likely be more along the lines of\nexistential crises and crying.\nThis is a Class B illegal drug, pure\nand simple, so do bear that in mind.\nImperial\u2019s\nown Student\nAlcohol and\nSubstance\nMisuse\npolicy makes\nno explicit\nreference to\nstudy drugs\nIf you take Ritalin the night before\nyour big test, you\u2019re going to have to\nbe very careful in those post-exam\ncelebrations. Like all drugs, mixing\nwith alcohol can sometimes have\nunexpected effects. The alertness\nyou gain when taking drugs like\nRitalin may well stop you noticing\nhow drunk you\u2019re getting,\nwhich could result in\nalcohol poisoning.\nRitalin combined\nwith other\nstimulants, like\ncoffee or Red\nBull, will put a\nlot of pressure\non your heart,\nso at the very\nleast, avoid\nJagerbombs.\nWill I get in trouble?\nTechnically, possession of drugs\nlike Ritalin without a prescription\nis illegal. If you don\u2019t have ADHD\nand you\u2019re found with Ritalin, it\u2019s\ntreated as a Class B drug, which\ncould get you five years in prison. In\nreality,this kind of sentence is pretty\nrare and you\u2019re likely to get a slap on\nthe wrist or a caution. As with all\nClass Bs, if you have so much that it\nlooks like you\u2019re selling it, you could\nbe looking at an unlimited fine and\nsome prison time.\nImperial\u2019s own Student Alcohol\nand Substance Misuse policy\nmakes no explicit reference to study\ndrugs. It says students\u2019 performance\nmust not be affected by substance\nmisuse, which it defines as taking a\nsomething that \u201cadversely interferes\nwith an individual\u2019s health, work\nor study performance or conduct\u201d.\nAs study drugs enhance your\nperformance,arguablytheyshouldn\u2019t\ncome under this banner.The College\ndoes include prescription medicines\nnot prescribed to the user in the\ndefinition of \u2018drugs\u2019, and insists that\nthey should not be brought onto\nthe premises. The college\u2019s rules\nalso state that students must ensure\ntheir behaviour \u201cis not affected by\nexcessive alcohol consumption or\nsubstance misuse\u201d. That\u2019s a no from\nImperial then.\nJennie Watson, the DPW, told\nFELIX: \u201cNo Imperial student\nshould feel they have to take drugs to\ncope with their academic workload.\nWe have been highlighting the\nissue of student stress and its impact\non mental health to College for\na long time, and we\u2019re pleased to\nsee positive changes such as more\ncounsellors and reductions in\ncoursework \u2013 but there\u2019s still a long\nway to go.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d urge students using drugs to\nenhance academic performance to\nconsider the fact there is very little\nevidence of benefit and that the long\nterm effects are broadly unknown.\u201d\nMake up your own mind, but if\nyou\u2019ve really not revised, it\u2019s unlikely\na Ritalin dose will save you.\nAt the very\nleast, avoid\nJagerbombs Look familiar?

I don\u2019t\nwant to become another person to\nunfollow.\nSo it might have surprised some\nwhen I shared my first petition\nthis week \u2013 and no, it wasn\u2019t about\nthe farce that is Donald Trump, or\neven the latest cuts to our beloved\nNHS. Whilst those anger me,\nthey are too blatantly wrong to be\nworth sharing a petition over. It\nwas about preventing something\nso perversely cruel, misguided and\ndeliberately deconstructive that\nI just had to speak out. As part\nof the government's latest white\npaper on the corporation, the BBC\nis being forced to remove 11,000\nrecipes freely available without\nadvertisements, pop-ups or having\nto link your Facebook account. I\nwas disgusted. The more I read, the\nmore disgusted I was. Our darling\nchancellor, George \u201cCokehead\u201d\nOsborne had decided, in a fit of\nrage against Nigella (despite their\nshared moniker) and her lot, that,\nand I quote:\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a website that\u2019s\ngot features and cooking recipes\n\u2013 effectively the BBC website\nbecomes the national newspaper\nas well as the national broadcaster.\nThere are those sorts of issues we\nneed to look at very carefully.\u201d\nHeaven forbid people be able to\nget what they paid for! Those recipes\n\u2013 be they the ones that started\nJamie Oliver\u2019s career, dripped out of\nMary Berry\u2019s amazing repertoire of\nvariations on cake, or were simply\nwritten up by one of the unpaid\ninterns at the Beeb \u2013 were all funded\nby us, the licence fee-paying proles.\nThe way in which they must stop\nmaintaining the database will also\nmake it unsearchable, meaning\nthat a crawler engine (like Google)\nwon't be able to find the recipes if\nyou searched for them. You\u2019d have\nto know the exact URL, and they\u2019re\nnot even sure they\u2019ll keep hosting\nthe content at all. So, they\u2019ll be\ndestroying 11,000 recipes from\nthe internet archives \u2013 because it\u2019s\nan issue of national importance?\nBullshit.\nMore than that, I object to the\nsecond part of his reasoning \u2013\nthat these features and recipes are\n\u201cissues\u201d we need to all look at. Ah\nyes, one of the main issues blocking\nour road to economic recovery after\nthe mess the labour government left\nus in, is the excess of brownies in\nthis country \u2013 and no, that\u2019s not a\neuphemism.\nWhy should we be letting petty\ngovernment oversight of a publicly\nfunded media group,whose sole role\nis to provide varied resources for\nknowledge and entertainment of the\npublic, prevent us from discovering\nPaul Hollywood\u2019s secret to a good\ncrust on your loaf? The true answer\nis at the heart of this messy fight\nwith the BBC \u2013 cronyism.\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want the BBC\nto completely crowd out national\nnewspapers. If you look at the BBC\nwebsite it is a good product but it is\nbecoming a bit more imperial in its\nambitions.\u201d\nOsbornesaystheBBCisbecoming\ntoo imperial in its ambitions -better cut back on the number of\npavlova recipes asap! Why on earth\nhe thinks that cutting back on the\nBBC's publicly available recipes is\ngoing to save the failing institutions\nthat are this country's newspapers, I\nwill never know. It is through their\nown resistance to adaption that they\nwill fail \u2013 they refuse to move into\nthe digital world at the same speed\nas the rest of us, and it will cost\nthem. Already, broadsheet sales are\ndropping year on year,as people turn\nto one of the many free online news\nproviders that don\u2019t have paywalls.\nWhat our dear chancellor fails to\nspot is that no matter how much\nfunding Rupert Murdoch gives his\nparty to bend it to his will, no one\nin their right mind would ever think\n\u201cVictoria Sponge recipe \u2013 the Sun is\nprobably a good place to look\u201d. No,\nthey\u2019ll go to one of the myriad other\nProtect Ainsley Harriot content at all costs. Photo Credit: reddit.com\nfree content-hosting websites, with\nhundreds of user-reviewed recipes.\nOsborne's bizarre disconnect from\nreality is pervasive in so many of his\npolicies, but it really ticks me off in\nthis one.It's not all bad news - some\nenterprising fellows have come to\nthe rescue with some clever coding,\npulling the text currently available\non the BBC Food section and\nmaking it into a freely torrentable\n(which I do not advocate yada yada)\npackage.Why this has to happen for\nthose recipes to be preserved, I do\nnot know \u2013 but sadly, the pictures\nof Ainsley Harriott in all his oily\ngoodness will be lost.\nIn even better news, the good old\nBritish Library and the National\nLibrary of Iceland have both\nconfirmed that they too have made\na full copy of all the pages that\nwere on the BBC\u2019s Food section.\nSo all is not lost \u2013 though how\naccessible their archives will be I do\nnot know, and I suspect that all the\ncomment functionality of the pages\n(hurling abuse at bakers who don\u2019t\nput currants in their scones \u2013 I\u2019m\nlooking at you, Mary Berry) might\nbe lost.\nStill, I signed the petition. Who\nknows? We might be able to reverse\nthe misguided policy, we might not.\nIncidentally, I managed to get 20 of\nmy friends to sign too \u2013 so maybe\nI\u2019ll have to reconsider the impact of\nthose shared statuses on Facebook.\nPerhaps Donald Trump is the\nmessiah I needed after all.\nThe BBC\nis being\nforced to\nremove\n11,000\nrecipes\nHeaven\nforbid\npeople be\nable to get\nwhat they\npaid for\nWhy you should care about the higher\neducation white paper\nIt's not good news\nJennie Watson\nDeputy President (Welfare)\nCustomers, customers everywhere. Photo Credit: radioactivecookies.com\nT\nhings got pretty busy\nthis week in the Union\noffices with the release\nof the higher education\nwhite paper Success as a knowledge\neconomy: teaching excellence,\nsocial mobility and student choice\non Monday morning; this is\nthe Government\u2019s response to\nconsultation on the preceding\nhigher education green paper, of\nwhich there was much criticism.\nIt was essentially 100 pages of half\nbaked, often misconceived ideas.\nThe white paper may be a significant\nimprovement and we are entirely\nright to celebrate the massive wins\nthat came in response to the green\npaper consultation. That said, there\nis still a lot wrong with the white\npaper \u2013 the battle may be won, but\nthe war is far from over.\nOne of the central principles\nof the proposed changes to\nhigher education is the Teaching\nExcellence Framework, TEF. The\nidea is to have a tiered system\nwhereby universities have to prove\ntheir \u2018excellence\u2019in order to move up\nthe levels of TEF, which then gives\nthem the right to charge higher fees.\nThe metrics against which \u2018teaching\nexcellence\u2019 was to be measured were\nshoddy at best \u2013 I doubt many will\nagree that NSS scores stack up to\nthe quality of teaching you receive\nduring your degree.\nThe white paper also sets out\nproposals to make it easier for new,\nprivate universities to enter the\nsector and to give the government\nmore power to shut down existing\ninstitutions. Ominously, it also\nseems that the government will\nseek to have more control over the\nmaterial which is taught to students.\nAnother overarching theme in the\nwhite paper is that of social mobility.\nThe argument that the government\u2019s\nproposals will achieve their\nsupposed goal of getting students\nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds\ninto high quality universities,\nto result in higher academic\nattainment within these groups\nare wafer-thin. The general theory\nwithin the sector is that a tiered\nsystem of fees will only result in a\nghettoisation of higher education.\nBy this I mean that students from\ndisadvantaged backgrounds will\ngo to low-quality institutions to\nstudy degrees with poor graduate\noutcomes.The wealthy will continue\nto gain access to high-fee, high-quality institutions, and as a result\nwill get into better paid jobs. As a\nresult, inequality and the wealth\ngap will increase, entirely contrary\nto the government's alleged aim of\nincreasing social mobility.\nIt's clear that the white paper\nrepresents some major wins. There\nare areas government has listened\nto the criticism of it's paper. That\nsaid, these wins are piecemeal, and\nmostly represent the finer details\nof the proposal. For example, the\nconcept of uncapping fees was not\ntruly removed, only delayed.\nIn the green paper there was a\nbrief but ominous section about\nstudent unions, which is an area\nwhich worries me and the rest of\nthe sector greatly. The insinuation\nwas that unions lack accountability,\ntransparency and regulation. There\nwas a proposal to bring student\nunions into the trade union bill.\nThe push-back in responses on this\nfrom unions was strong and several\nproposals from the green paper have\nbeen dropped for the white paper,\nhowever there are still elements that\nhint that the government will come\nafter unions again.\nThe white paper states that\n\u201cresponses to the green paper\nhighlighted the role played by\nstudents\u2019 unions and guilds in\nhigher education institutions\u201d,\nhowever it does not truly recognise\nthat unions play a huge role in\nhelping to shape and enhance\nstudent experience through\nstudent activities, volunteering\nopportunities and lobbying within\nuniversities for improved teaching\nand student support.There is also,so\nfar not much in the way of concrete\ncommitments to give students a\nmeaningful voice, or even a seat at\nthe table in the proposed Office for\nStudents, the new body which will\nregulate universities. For me this\nfeels like a sidelining of students\nand students\u2019 unions.\nAs I highlighted strongly in the\nICU response to the Green Paper,\nwe work very much in partnership\nwith the College. Our relationship\nis characterised by a mutual respect\nfor pretty much all areas of the\nCollege and we are always consulted\nand listened to, on issues big and\nsmall, which will affect students.\nI can\u2019t see a lot in the white paper\nwhich truly recognises and commits\nto supporting this style of working\nas an integral part of the proposed\nfuture of higher education.\nThe government coming after\nstudent unions is no new thing;\nevery time unions come out\nfighting, and often win. Clearly\nit is entirely possible for student\nunions to mobilise effectively in a\ncoordinated way, and win big battles\nlike these proposed reforms. These\nchanges will have an enormous\nimpact on students in years to come;\nwe would be failing in our jobs if we\ndid not fight for meaningful student\ninfluence in these changes.\nICU will be responding to the\nwhite paper, and I want to hear as\nmuch student opinion as possible.\nAlthough this is a difficult time for\neveryone with academic pressures at\npeak levels, if you have any opinions\nabout the white paper which you\nwould like to be incorporated into\nour stance, you know where to find\nme.\nThe wealthy\nwill continue\nto gain\naccess to\nhigh fee\nhigh quality\ninstitutions\nIt was\nessentially\n100 pages\nof half\nbaked ideas\n\n"
