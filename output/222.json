Perhaps you\nhave a list of requirements in the back of your mind.\nThese, at a guess, would be some of the items in that list:\n1 A large organisation (you\n\u2022 may have been thinking of the\ngiants of commerce or industry,\nwhose names are household words).\nOne of the reasons why this is a reasonable requirement is that, especially in modern conditions, large\norganisations tend to offer much\nmore scope than small ones.\n*\n% Good pay and prospects. You\n* expect to work hard, and it is only\nfair that this should have some\ntangible and obvious recognition.\n3 Security. You do not want to\nbe forever wondering whether\nyour job is about to give you up!\nA Variety of work. The idea of\n\u2022 strap-hanging in the same train\nevery morning, sitting at the same\ndesk every day, doing the same job\nyear after year is probably repugnant to you.\nEA chance to see something of\n** the world. The idea of travel is\nattractive, and if it can be part of\nyour job, so much the better.\nC Congenial company. You ex-\" pec t to apply yourself to your\ncareer, and want to be able to relax\namong people who share your interests and can discuss your problems\nagainst a background of common\nknowledge.\nHA sense of purpose. You are,\n* above all, anxious not to waste\nyour talents and your time. You\nwant your work to have some meaning and significance; to amount to\nsomething.\nThese are all eminently reasonable\nrequirements. And the R.A.F. meets\nevery one of the ro J More than this, the R.A.F. is especially attractive to the graduate. As a graduate in the R.A.F. you have\nspecially favourable terms of entry,\nback-dated seniority, and every possible encouragement to make the\nmost of your potential. In the R.A.F., unlike civilian organisations, all the\ntop jobs have to be filled from within.\nAnd as a graduate, you are in line for\npromotion to the very highest ranks.\nWHICH OF THESE\nCAREERS IS RIGHT\nFOR YOU?\nFlying and executive? If this\nattracts you, you should find out\nmore about the Flying Branch.\nEngineering? In the Technical\nBranch, the R.A.F. has vacancies\nfor electrical, electronic and mechanical engineers, to work on some of\nthe most highly developed equipment in the world.\nTeaching? In the R.A.F. you could\nteach, according to your qualifications, at any level from G.C.E. to\npost-Graduate. The R.A.F. Education Officer is the focus of many\nextra-mural activities.\nManagement? Much of the day-to-day management of the R.A.F. on the ground falls to the Equipment and Secretarial Branches which\noffer excellent careers to graduates.\nEquipment officers are the logistics\nexperts, and deal with the planning,\nsupply and movement of all mate riel used by the R.A.F. throughout the\nworld. The Secretarial Branch is\nconcerned with general admin is tra tion, personnel management, accounting and intelligence.\nFor more information please\ncontact the Secretory of your\nAppointments Board or write,\ngiving your qualifications and\nyour age, saying (if you can)\nwhich Branch most interests\nyou, to\u2014Group Captain J.

League this season.\nI.C. kicked off and started at a fast\npace producing some good football.\nThey opened t ne scoring when Hunt\nmade a good run and squared the ball\nto Wideiski, whose shot was deflected\nby a defender past the stranded goal-keeper.\nIt was\" unfortunate that I.C. did\nnot keep up the pressure, for Woolwich hit back almost immediately\nwhen the centre-forward was left unmarked and was allowed to score. This\ngoal seemed to infuse the I.C. team\nwith enthusiasm; shots from Smart and\nEastell went close but they could not,\nin general, pierce the Woolwich rear-guard.\nWoolwich went ahead when, after a mix up in the I.C, defence, th\u00a9\ncentre-forward was again left free\nand proceeded to send Wojtowicz the\nwrong way by shooting into the\ncorner of the net.\nMistimed Clearance\nAfter the re-start, the game was more\neven and Wellfair hit cross after cross\ninto the Woolwich goal mouth with no\nnet result. Both defences found the\nsurface treacherous, and it was to the\ncredit of both teams that mistakes\nwere comparatively few. However,\nafter I.C. conceded a free kick on\nthe half-way line Johnson completely\nmistimed his clearance and the\nWoolwich inside forward scored\neasily from twelve yards. Although\nI.C. tried hard to reduce the arrears\nthere was no further score.\nThis was a disappointing match for\nI.C.; although the play was even, i'. was their opponents who were more\ndirect in front of goal, and thus deserved their win.\nCross Country\nFRUSTRATION\n^ [ OW THAT we have our strongest 1st team for a couple of\nyears, the Cross Country was hoping to move up from its inevitable 6th place when the second league match of the season was held\nat St. Mary's on November 3rd. The team is, however, still\nmissing two of its runners through\ninjury and with the unus ally high\nstandard in U.L. this year they\nwould have a har.l fight. Fast and\nflat the 6 mile, St. Mary's course requires accurate pace judgement and\nover-eagerness at the beginning will\nbe paid for later though with 90\nstarters and a course very narrow at\npoints where extra speed may pay off\nthe problems are tricky indeed.\nFinal tally\nMost runners managed to so've\nthese problems and recorded times\nnear their personal bests. First hone\nwas I.C. captain Howard Dickson\nwho, in spite of a time over 2 minutes\nbetter than he did last year could\nonly come 27th. When the points\nwere all totalled up we were again in\n6th place just behind Kings which\nseems to be our fate in every race\nthese days.\nWe have two teams in League 1,\nand coming 13th out of 14 the 2nd team will have to fight hard to avoid\nthe.long-impending drop to the lower\ndivision.\nSub Aqua\nWEEKEND BEFORE LAST, Nov.\n* * 6th and 7th, the Sub Aqua Club\norganised two successful dives. One,\nmainly for those new to the club, was\nat Black Park near Slough. Although\nthe water was dark and very muddy,\na good dive was had by all.\nThe other dive was at Westwater in\nthe Lake District\u2014here a depth of\n160 ft. was reached in cold, clear\nwater. At this depth the divers were\neffected by nitrogen which has a similar effect to that of drink on the\nsurface. Some good photography was\ndone with the came as taking the\npressure of 5 atmospheres without\ntrouble.\nFFINE\nFFETTLE\nFFAGINS\nFTER EIGHT matches this season\nThe Ffagins XV\u2014I.C's. most attractive rugby side, and one of London's most prolific scorers\u2014have\namassed 164 points and had only 33\npoints scored against them, amounting\nto seven outright victories.\nIn spite of the fact that six of the\nregular team have lost, or are about\nto lose, their bachelor hood, the well\nknown Ffagin spirit of adventure '\n\u00bb\n>\never dominant on and off the field of\nplay and at Beckenham (23-3), Reading (6V3) and Port of London (26-0)\ntheir displays will long be remembered. Both Roslyn Park (6-3) and\nWasps (9-3) proved tougher fixtures\nthan last year but victories were\ndeserved.\nUnder the captaincy of Rex Parker\nthe team has remained consistent and\nthe pre-season signings of Barry Mair\nand Ian Craig have proved a great\nasset. Alan Davies, seen from side\nelevation, has made many pleasing\nruns; John Hall has yet to complete\na match at wing three quarter; Pete\nCunningham is determined and rugged\nin the centre, and Derek Slack has\nmore than made up for the loss of\nJohn Richardson at scrum-half.\nThe babes of the team\u2014Parker, MoBain and Stewart\u2014inject the essential\nundergraduate keenness and stability\ninto the team, which might otherwise\nbe harmonic, hor moni c and undisciplined. DAVE McBAIN P.S. We would like to announce the\nengagement of Rex Parker, the\ncan tain of Ffaeins. to Miss Pat Rae.\n\n"

If the outcome of the towpath\nbattles was predictable, that of the water borne one was not. With\nthe Guilds Morphy crew little faster in practice than their Lowry\neight; with the Mines number 7 out with a strained back; with R.C.S. a very much improved and unknown factor ; this\nmise d one of the best contests yet.\nEager to prove their new found\nstrength R.C.S. sped ahead at the\nstart with Mines leading a slow-start-ing Guilds. R.C.S.' s start turned out\nto be more optimism than judgement\nand Guilds, rowing well, moved up\non Mines, then R.C.S. and pulled\nsteadily away to win once again. Left\nto fight for second place R.C.S. and\nMines passed the boat house with the\nMiners leading by a canvas and underrating their rivals whom they went\non to beat by about a length.\nCaught a Crab\nThe Lowry race, which actually\ntook place first, was never in quite\nsuch doubt. Guilds, the sure favour-ites, led right from the start with\nmines close upon them. From Beverly\nBrook, however, the Engineers began\nto move away easily and it was again\nleft to the other two to scrap for second place. After losing a length\non the start R.C.S. had fought back\nto withi.n a length when, in the last\n20 strokes, they caught a crab. They\nfinished 1| lengths down on Mines\nwho were 4 lengths behind the win-ner s.

The best performance\nof the match was that of Phil Prescott\nwho although only a green belt himself had a clear win over one of Cambridge's two brown belts.\nBy the time they came to fight Oxford some of the Oxford team had had\nto leave and so they put their in st ruc tor, a brown belt, into the contest.\nIncluding him we drew 10-10 but the\nmatch result, discounting him, was\n10-0 for I.C.A team, that was virtually our\nsecond, convincingly beat Chelsea college 40-20 in a belt-for-belt contest\nat Chelsea last week.

It is difficult to find convincing reasons why\npeople should go to watch such events\nbut when you go to play matches at\nplaces like St. Mary's or Borough\nRoad, where there is always a significant and voluble touch line audience.\nthe atmosphere is quite different and\nfar more exciting. Perhaps we have\njust grown too large and diverse an\ninstitution to be that interested in\neach others doings.\nIf this is because we are all busy\nwith our own activities then maybe\nit is really a healthy sign but if it's because people are just too apathetically lazy to make an effort we are\nmissing a vital part of university life.\nRugby Report\nl.C.

CHESSMEN are at present\nwaging a giant-killing campaign.\nAlthough they have only just gained\npromotion to the 1st division of the\nLondon League they are making a strong bid to get to the top of it in\ntheir first season.

Although\nsomewhat overawed by the strength of\nthe opposition a very good start was\nmade and the first fifteen minutes\nwere spent around the Richmond 25.\nRay missed a difficult penalty chance\nbut a few minutes later made amends\nby kicking a difficult goal from the\ntouch line across the wind. Territorial advantage was still maintained\nand Ray kicked another penalty\nfrom a similar position on the opposite touch line. Half time came with the score 6\u20140\nin I.C.'s favour which was not enough\nconsidering the wind advantage which\nwould belong to Richmond in the\nsecond half.\nPlaying Well\nHowever l.C. showed their best\nform of the season and continued to\ndrive the opposition back against the\nwind but Richmond managed to\nequalise by a drop goal and a penalty\nand then take t the lead through\nanother penalty. With the college\nstill playing well the backs began to\nrun and handle with confidence and\neventually scored a good try through\nRiley, the left wing. At this time\nthe Vikings considered themselves\nvery lucky to draw, but IC. conceded a penalty fully 55 yd s. from\ntheir posts and a goal was kicked by\nfull back Moffat, an Oxfordshire cap\ngiving Richmond a win ; much\nagainst the run of the play.\nPete Ray.\nWith the cold un fr hrt d ly wind\ncutting across the Thames on\nMorphy Day, the three crews\nwrench at the oars.\nAthletes\nWINTER\nTRACK\nTHE nights draw in and the\nweather gets colder, the\nnatural tendency of most athletes\nis to retire to the warmth of a fireside and leave their strenuous\no if td a wr activities 'til the warmer\nweather.\nThis year, however, things are different and last Saturday morning\ntook our Athletics team down to\nMotspur Park for the first meeting of\nthe new winter league.

The general\nquality of the singing was amazingly\nhigh but it is regrettable that the\nIsraeli theme became somewhat lost at\ntimes.\nIt was, perhaps, a novel experience\nfor the audience, sitting in the warmth\nand comfort of the lounge, to be reminded that 27 years ago to the day,\non Nov. 7th1938, the Nazi ho loco ust began in Germany with the burning\nof the synagogues\u2014now known\nwidely as \" Crystal Night.\" It was\nTheo Johnson who recalled this event\nby singing \" The Peat Boy Soldier,\"\na song of the concentration camps.\nIn spite of this sobering recollection the evening proved in general\na happy and enjoyable event for all\nthose who took part.\nNORMAN STREET programme, entitled \"Shalom\nThe Battle on Putney Towpath\u2014Morphy 1965\nFAWKES FJZZLES\nThird Satellite\nNow In Orbit\nLAST SUNDAY AT MIDNIGHT the Third Satellite came into\norbit of the Earth.

This is\nprayer in which the palms of the\nhands are held facing outwards to let\nthe energy stream forth fr cl m the\nhands as a white light. It is not like\nChristian prayer where the hands are\nheld together, short-circuiting the vital\nenergy.\nAfter each period of \" spiritual\npush \" the Chairman of the Aetherius\nSociety Dr. George King is notified\nof the absorption factor that has been\nrecorded aboard the satellite. In times\nof war and nuclear weapon testing\nthis has been as low as 1.5 but during\nthe period when the latest set of\nteachings of the Grand Master Jesus\nwere given in 1958 it reached a value\nof 9.\nUnfortunately the satellite will not\nbe visible while it is in orbit because\nthe space in tell e gence s, in their wis-dom, have a means of refracting light\nand radar waves through 360 degrees.\nJ. CAWSON\nDebates Loss to U.C. gAD ORGANISATION marred an otherwise successful debate\nbetween IC and UC Debating Society on Tuesday week. The\nDebate, first round in the UL U Debating Competition, had to be held\nbefore November 10th, and was organised hurriedly for November\nSlh. Little publicity produced an audience of proportionate size, and\nthe six who did arrive had to wait for thirty minutes in the \" comfort\"\nof the Union snack bar before\nthe debate began. Even at such\nshort notice, it should have been\npossible to have held the meeting in the less noisy surroundings\nof a lecture theatre away from a busy road.\nThe system employed in these\ncompetition debates is that the two\nteams are told whether they will be\nsupporting or defending, 15 minutes\nbefore the start, each team consisting\nof four speakers.\nIn the event, UC were proposing\nthat \" This house considers that the\n' establishment' is a barrier to pro-gres s,\" IC opposing.\nThe first speaker for the proposition (L; nda Peters\u2014Social Secretary\nof UL U Debates) defined the Establishment, and also their definition of\nprogress (a step towards equality of\nopportunity for all), both of which\nhowever were rejected by the IC team,\nthe one as a product of the \" angry\nyoung men\" writers of the 1950's and the other as \" only accepted by\nsocialists . . . or the Daily Worker.\"\nJack Lisman, opening for IC, dismissed attack on what the proposition called the establishment, as\nnaive\u2014the authority of what is\nusually considered as the establishment stemming from \" informed\ntradition,\" and being an entirely good\nthing.\nA bright part of the evening was\nthe lighthearted speech made by Dave\nSefton of IC (ex-Toronto), who told\nus that the word \" establishment\"\nwas one of the several with which he\nhad had difficulty when he first came\nto England; however he now realised\nthat it meant everyone who had slept\nwith Christine Keeler. The two teams\nwere completed by Mike Edwards and\nDavid Reich (IC), the latter accusing\nthe proposition of \" compressing\ngreatest number of words into least\namount of thought\" and \" booming\nover the landscape looking for ideas.\"\nPerhaps the last speaker (from\nIllinois High School Championship\nDebating team, and UC), Susie Narburg, had prepared her speech least,\nand benefitted from this, simply\npointing out contradictions in the\n\" words words words \" of the opposition. This last point, lack of team-work\non the part of the IC team was mentioned by the judges in their com-ment s, and also the point that the\nopposition should not move outside\nthe limits set by the proposition\u2014very\nsimilar comments being made last\nyear. The verdict was that IC lost\nby 488 points to 520, UC going forward to the next round. It is to be\nhoped that next year's team will bear\nin mind this year's judge's comments.\nJ.G. THE MEDIOCRE GROUP, and\nsomewhat unspectacular display of\nfireworks, made a potentially enjoyable one. It is about time IC dance\narrangers learnt that for important\nsocial events it is worthwhile charging a little j nore for tickets so that\nbetter entertainment can be provided.\nQuite clearly a lot of hard work\nwent into organisation of the event,\nbut surely 5/.- for a double ticket is\nnot cheap, but too cheap. Few people\ncould object to an increase to, per-hap s,7/6, and with 250 tickets sold,\nthis would provide another \u00a330, which\nwould provide a considerably higher\nstandard of music and display.\nHowever, despite the above drawbacks it should be mentioned that\nmany people had a grand time\u2014notably a large number of small children\nplaying near the bonfire, and a considerable number of somewhat larger\nchildren (?), strangely enough in\npairs, who wandered off into the fog\nfor the evening !\nBEER EIGHT AT EXETER The bar at Exeter University Union\nhad to be closed early last Saturday\nafter the soccer team, not content with\nsettling their differences with Bristol\non the field, engaged in a battle with\nbeer and soda water. Someone tried\nto do a striptease and Bristol students\ninvaded the stage at the Union Dance.\nArthur leaves\nthe bar\nof Southside\nTHERE HAS BEEN a general reshuffle in College barmen. Arthur,\none of the Southside barmen, has resigned because he wished for more\nleisure time, especially at weekends.\nStan has moved from the Union to\ntry his hand at running the more\ncivilised Southside Bar and Jack has\ntaken his place.

The Guy\nFawkes bonfire procession around the West End alone raised \u00a317.\nHowever, banners are costing \u00a315 for the materials.\nWe asked Chris Hocking how well\nhe thought the Week had gone. He\nregretted that it had not received as\nmuch support as he would have liked.\nAn advertising manager could not be\nappointed be tore Monday 9 November.\nHe himself had been too busy\nworking on the legal i ties, getting licences for house-to-house collections,\nto have time to see about posters\nhimself.\nLast year the Rev. Bruce Kenrick,\nChairman of the Notting Hill Housing\nTrust, expressed fears- of irresponsible\nactions by IC Carnival reflecting on\nthe Trust. Chris has no fears in this\nrespect this year. All stunts will need\nthe approval of Commando Leader\nRog. Cook (17 Old Beit) and the Carnival Committee.\nWe suggested that a Christmas gift\nmight be welcomed by the Trust. This\nhe endorsed, adding that of course it\nvery much depended upon how much\nthe Rag raised. The sum of \u00a3650\u2014\nsufficient to make possible the housing\nof one large family\u2014seemed to be a suitable figure to aim for.\nAfter Rag Week the Carnival Chairman hopes that each of the larger\nclubs and societies will go out on\nstunts to collect for the Carnival each\nweekend. He felt that it was essential\nthat Carnival should run continuously\nthrough the year, not just for one\nweek last year.\nNH HT appear to be more in need\nof money than help. In spite of this\nChr'~ felt that working parties were\nas essential a part of the Carnival\neffort as the collections themselves.\nHe knew of only two such working\nparties last year.\nTo the suggestion that collectors do\nnot know enough about the Trust, the\nCarnival Chairman told us. that the\nCommittee at least were well-informed\nand that he was hoping to arrange a General Studies lecture which could be\ngiven more publicity than the one last\nyear.\nAnother point he made was that he\nhopes to train next year's Carnival\nCommittee this year.\nStreet Collections during Rag Week\nWanted by VSO\n900 MAN-YEARS\n\u2014Give us one\nby serving a year\noverseas\nfrom next September\nConsult your Appointments Board or write to\nVOLUNTARY SERVICE OVERSEAS3 HANOVER STREET LONDON W1\" THE CONDITIONS in Notting Hill are really very little\ndifferent from those in Harlem.\nHarlem has the outward appearance of a slum\u2014with its dirty\nstreets\u2014which Notting Hill has\nnot got, but once you get inside\nthe houses they are very similar.\"\nBruce Kenrick, chairman of the\nNotting Hill Housing Trust was\ntalking to Felix on the work of\nthe Trust.\nBruce Kenrick has spent his life\nworking for the Church in different\nparts of the world. Before coming\nto Notting Hill he worked in India\nand Harlem\u2014both places with serious\ntensions and housing problems.\nA:k ed whether he thought that the\nproblems of India made those of\nNotting Hill appear insignificant, he\npointed out that it is easier to live\nwithout a house in Calcutta. It does\nnot get cold at night\u2014and it is an\naccepted thing to sleep on the station\nplatforms, whereas it is not here ;\nnot that it is de sir a b'e there.\nNo. 107 Blenheim Crescent acts as\nthe headquarters of the Trust. In appearance it is exactly the same as the\nother rather shabby houses in the area,\nonly the small piece of card on the\ndoor showing it to be the Trust's Practical Christianity\nIt was in 1963 Mr. Kenrick came\nto live in Notting Hill, and with ag:o up of local people formed the\ni rust. Bruce Kenrick is a minister of\nthe Church of Scotland, and he considers the trust to be his new parish.\nHe believes that the Church should\nnot be merely a building on the corner with services at eleven and six.\nThe Church should be involved with\npeople and their lives. Every Wednesday the workers in the Trust's office\nLAM LEY'S TECHNICAL & GENERAL\nBOOKS\nART MATERIALS\nDRAWING\nINSTRUMENTS\nSTATIONERY\nPAPERBACKS\n1, 3 & 5 EXHIBITION ROAD,\nLONDON, S.W.7 meet at his home for Communion.\nThis does not mean, however, that\nthe trust tries automatically to convert their tenants\u2014the subject of religion must be raised by the tenant\nfirst and no discrimination on religious\ngrounds is practised when selecting\ntenants. Indeed a couple of weeks ago\nMr. Kenrick had a party of Scottish\nPresbyterians and a number of members of the Notting Hill Atheist\nSociety working together for the trust.\nPolitical Activity.\nThe Royal Borough of Kensington\nand Chelsea has the lowest proportion\nof council houses in the whole of\nGreater London\u20145 per cent. The\ncouncil is not very interested in this\ndistrict and in Mr. Kenrick's words\nthe local M.P.\" would occupy his\ntime better looking at these problems\nthan in drawing Westminster Bridge.\"\nThe 1965 Rent Act should give security of tenure and a fair rent to\nthose bold enough to claim them but\nit cannot give families the kitchen or\nunshared toilets that they need. Both\npolitical parties agree that it will take\nnine to ten years to provide homes for\nall those who have no home at all.\nThe people of Notting Hill cannot\nwait that long. Political lobbying is\nessential to their cause but the trust\ncannot wait passively for the ponderous machinery of government to act.\nSuccessful Integration\nAt the end of its first eighteen\nmonths the trust had bought eleven\nhouses and rehoused 150 people. By\nthe end of 1965 the Trust hopes to\nhave homes for more than 600 people.\n\" Whatever you do, don't bring any\nof those blacks here\"\u2014words from\nthe tenants already in one of the\nhouses which the Trust bought. This\nunderlines the racial tensions simmering below the surface in the area.\nHowever, the most urgent need that\nthe Trust came up against next was\nto re house a family consisting of an\nIrish wife, a West Indian husband and\nfour children. They were put in\nthe house, and now on Saturday\nnights the old pensioners and the\nWest Indians drink their beer together,\nsinging calypsos and Welsh songs. In\nthe next house an African repaired\nthe pram of an English woman who\nhad gone to hospital 4o have a baby,\nand the Indian woman in the house\nwas the only visitor that the woman\nhad whilst she was in hospital.\nTenants are selected from recommendations made by the Notting Hill\nSocial Council and visits made by\nmembers of the Trust to the families.\nThe Trust attempts to allocate houses\nto the different races in the area in\nthe same proportions as are in the\nwhole Noting Hill community.\nI.C. and the Trust\nMr. Kenrick is very grateful for\nthe work that Imperial College did for\nthe Trust last year and is hoping that\nwe will bs more successful this v ear. Last year he said that was a little\nafraid t.v. t irresponsible acts by the\ncollege might bring the name of the\nNotting Hill Housing Trust into dis-repute. He was remembering his own\ndays of running up the main road in\nEdinburgh d.'es sed in a grass skirt.\nThis year, he said, \" After the success of last year, I have no such\nworries.\"\n\n"

HILL,\nChairman, Holland Club.\nAmen\nT VDGING Mr. Pilcher by his letter\nin the last edition of Felix, he appears to be of the \" you name it I'm agin' it\" mentality. Thank goodness\nsuch childish ideas give way to\nmaturity if one wails long enough.\nAs a resident of one of the college\nhostels I wish to point out that not\nall of us share his views.\nSurely t ne gentleman must know,\n1 cause he is at l.C., that the scientific method is to test hypotheses by\nappealing to the facts\u2014not to make\nso called obvious assumptions. Th'2\nfact in this case is that there is one\nregulation which if broken may lead\nto expulsion from hall. That commandment reads \" Thou shalt not. introduce unofficial guests.. .\" If there\nis no intention to keep the rule why\napply for a room in hall ?\n. There must be some psychological\nreason for Mr. Pilcher to read morality into this.

Rather, I would\nsay, too many residents don't even\nknow the warden.\nOne last point. The use of the\nword \"consequently\" in Mr. Pilcher's third paragraph was totally illogical.\nIf he wants more privacy how can he\nbe alarmed to find locked gates on\nthe Southside balcony ? Especially\nsince these gates neither restrict his\ncoming in nor going out. I'm bewildered by him. A little more reason and a lot less emotion could lead\nto more sensible correspondence.\nG.P.

Teaching by men and women who are\namong the ablest of their generation... graduates\nwho are among the most outstanding of their\nyear. Teachers have greater influence on future\ngenerations than any other profession.\nWhat does Teaching offer you in return ?\nNew opportunities\nTeaching is a vigorous and growing profession. It offers\nthe graduate greater opportunities than ever before,\nboth in developing professional skills and in achieving\nposts of influence and responsibility \u2014 often far earlier\nthan in many other careers. For example, nearly half of\nthe men graduate teachers between 25 and 29 hold such\nposts and receive salaries well above the basic scale.\nAbout half of those in their 30's are heads of depart-ment s, earning up to \u00a32,330, or hold even higher posts.\nOne fifth of those now in their 40's are headmasters who\nmay earn salaries up to \u00a33,850. The prospects are even\nbetter for graduates with first or second class honours, or\na higher degree.\nNew ideas - new initiative\nThe mastery of teaching skills and the evolution of new\nmethods are a stimulating challenge. New discoveries\nand new knowledge present teachers with problems for\nwhich there are no precedents.

The 3-cw t.\" King Carrot III,\" a previously unattainable mascot, was carried away\nby twenty dedicated men, under the\nguidance of I.C.. Wooden Horse Club.\nThe team arrived at Northampton\nearly and at 9.15 a.m., precisely the\n\" plan \" went into operation. Half\nwere posted on staircases, two im mobilised the siren connected to the\nmascot, and the rest went to the scene\nof action. This wasi' conveniently\nsi tua ted in a common ,room safe from\nsecurity guards.\nHaving ceremoniously silenced an\ninquisitive Northampton individual,\nand explained to a cleaner that they\nwould not \" like to come back on\nMonday,\" the carrot snatchers set\nabout removing the mascot from its\nsupports.\nThe gateway was not completed\nwithout mishap. During a hasty flight\ndown the stairs the carrot went out of\ncontrol, trapping the unfortunate Max Liddie, of Maths 111, and injuring his\nankle. Max and mascot were carried\nto a van, and the raiding party es-caped, leaving a trail of fibreglass and\nconcrete in their wake.\nMORALS\nAT SILWOOD\n\" I LOOKED round to see if anyOne was looking and then took a flying\nleap across the road and planted my\nfoot right in its face.\" Professor\nCherry was describing his attitude to\none of Her Majesty's stamp machines\nthat had robbed him of his penny.\nIt was the first Touchstone weekend of this session, forty-one members of the college were meeting at\nSilwood Park to discuss, \" .Morals in\na technological world.\" In his opening talk Professor Cherry stressed the\ndangers of master-slave attitude to\nour society. The machine, he suggested, was at its best when it was not\nnoticed.\nIn his opinion, changing technology\nleads to changing morals, with the\ncoming of new techniques, we are\nfaced with new problems at a time\nwhen we are given little moral gui d ance. This is especially true of our\nchildren. We have removed all elements of excitement from the life of\nour urban communities\u2014\"Only adults\nare allowed to smash things.\" It is\nimpossible for a child to come by\ndanger legally.\nOUTCAST\nTHE RESPONSE from RS M to\nappeals for help in the construction of Mike, I.C.'s mascot-to-be has\nbeen almost non-existant.

The\ngreatest threats are that sanctions brought to bear on Rhodesia by other\ncountries will lead to deval u a ion of Rhodes'an currency, and, therefore a reduction in the value of grants.\nMeasures taken by Zambia to\nprotect herself might include limitations on export of money, which\nwould affect Zambians at IC.\nFeeling is running high among\nAfrican students, but' the only physical effect noted so far is the great\namount of discussion. However, it is\nthought that if the need arises, Africa\nSociety will organise a lobbying of the\nCollege Authorities and local M.P.s for assistance to students who find\nthemselves in difficulties due to the\nUDI. Similar action was taken when\nthe Nigerian Government reduced\ngrants to students studying abroad.\nHowever it is significant that\nseveral Rhodesian students refused to\ncomment, even anonymously, to\nFelix, due to possible repercussions\nfrom one side or another\u2014Rhodesians undergoing military training in\nthe UK have been asked to leave,\nand, \" of course I am rather worried\nabout the folk at home.\"\nFortunately many students have\nBritish passports, and the British\nGovernment has announced that it\nwill make it easier for Rhodesians\nwho who desire it to take out British\nCitizenship\u2014and this is something no\nrebel government can take away.\nCO ESCAPE CLEARS\nLABORATORY\nSince no breathing apparatus suitable for use in CO was available,\nDave Lawson and Tim Wickins reNUMBER\nPLEASE\n\" THIS PLACE is a madhouse !\" The telephone operator\nthrew up her arms in dismay.\nThe \"madhouse\" is a little-known room on the first floor of\nthe Beit building, where four\nw omer c work tha College switch-board, putting through up to 800\ncalls an hour each.

CHA6081 Inane Event of the Year\nAS USUAL, inquisitive fresher s made up the bulk of the soot throwing\n\u2022^\u2022brigades who make the annual trek to Putney, causing the maximum of\ninconvenience on the way. Why do they go? It certainly is not to support\nthe boats, although this is what college unions have most certainly told\nthem! Very few of them have a personal axe to grind, or any interest in the\nextraordinary efforts of the crews. They go because others went last year,\nand the year before that, and so on as far as anyone can remember. It must\nbe kept on; it's tradition, and tradition as everyone knows is sacred. Even\nMorphy Day? Never. It's the most inane event of the year, and it is about\ntime the negative effort put in last fortnight was turned to positive effort in supporting the carnival. Heaven knows, it needs it.\nDespicable Clique\nCEL DOM CAN AN event in this college pass these days without a gracious\nvisitation from hordes of inebriated slobs, who derive great pleasure and\namusement from disrupting, or even wrecking, hall parties, hops, hoots, and\nthe like. Already this year, a band has had one of its instruments filled\nwith beer, by one of the staunch members of THAT club, and every party in Southside this year has received its quota of the embittered merry-making\nclique. More recently, some of these hearty gentlemen have been slashing\n-seats and ripping posters on trains and have been really proud to have\ndone so. If these are the staggering lows they can reach so soon this year,\nI wonder what they'll be up to next summer. Looting? Raping? Who knows, even working, though I doubt if they will ever get that low.\nA Student Reception\nmr\nHIL ST ON the subject of gracious visitations, I.C. had another just recently,\nor didn't you notice? You could have been excused, for the college did\nabsolutely nothing to guarantee a good turn out of students to welcome her.\nAil advert for stewards, an overgrown clothes prop in Mech. Eng. set in a verdant turfed lawn, the complete disappearance of parked cars from Exhibition Road, and frantic sweeping all around were the only signs. As a result, there were more passers-by than students to welcome the Chancellor of\nour University. Incidently, while watching the fervent effort of the sweepers,\ngardeners etc., did you consider how much the college was spending on this\nevent alone, and then compare this with the amount Carnival raises each year?\nObviously Charity is not so deserving as antiquated protocol.\nParting is such...\nARTHUR' S leaving Southside bar will, no doubt, give rise to much hearty\ncheering, and comments about his sweet nature will be heard two a penny. In retrospect, however, whether or not you found his jokes and tricks\nsomewhat nauseating, Arthur's leaving is a great loss to the Union. Like\nhim or hate him (and who didn't?), you could not ignore him. I, for one,\nam sorry to see him leave, and wish him all the best in his new job.\nSICILY\nAt Castroreale, near Messina, we\nhave selected a tourist village for\nour 1966 Anglo-Italian Centre\nfor young people. The village is\nsituated by the sea within easy\nreach of the main tourist resorts,\nlike Taormina or the Aeolian\nIslands, and in an ideal geographical position for excursions to\nsites of Archaeological interest.\nA fortnight there at the beginning\nof September will cost 49 Gns. by\nair and on full board basis.\nFor an additional 4 Gns. you can\nhave 20 hours tuition in Italian.\nThis holiday is also being widely\nadvertised among North Italian\nUniversity Students.\nFor additional details write to :\u2014\nDISCOVERING SICILY\n69, New Oxford Street,\nLondon, W J GI INTERESTED IN :\nDANCING ?\nDRAMA?\nDISARMAMENT?\nThen come to the\nHALDANE\nLIBRARY\n13 Prince's Gardens\nfor a book about it.\nOpen 11\u20145.30 daily (11\u20147 on\nTuesdays and Thursdays)\nComment\nWasltAIIWorthwile?\nJ^T A TIME when we have been asked to curb spending it seems\nstrange that the College should have provided such a lavish turnout as it did nearly a fortnight ago for the visit of the Queen Mother\nto officially open the Biochemistry Building. Was it worth the\nexpense ? And who does it benefit ?\nThe traditionalists and royalists will, of course, say that it was a great\nhonour to have had a member of the British Royal Family to visit I.C. Let's not get sentimental\u2014the dowager Queen came here in her capacity\nas Chancellor of the University of London. And it just so happens that\nthe present UL Chancellor is a member of the monarchy.\nThere must be some people in the College who felt that this pseudo-event did\nus some good. One thing is certain, however; the majority of students\ndid not appreciate its value. Otherwise why did so few use their half-holiday for its intended purpose?\nBut the national press is sentimental, and any visit by a member of the\nRoyal Family is good for some free publicity for his, or her, host.\nFinancial aid is always welcome and the newspapers are read by the\nmagnates of industry. They are impressed, we hope, and so the initial\noutlay becomes more than justified.\nThe visit had its farcical aspects, such as those gentlemen employed in picking\nup individual leaves falling as nature intended from the trees to deface\nthe highways upon which Her Majesty deigned to be driven. On the\nother hand the .Metropolitan Police seemed for once to solve the rush-hour\ntraffic problem in Exhibition Road through mass-prohibition of parking,\na sign of things to come.\nContinous Carnival\n\" \" THE WISDOM of spending so much on the opening of the Biochemistry\nDept. will be discussed for many months yet. Would it not have been better to have given the money to this year's Carnival Charity, and so raise\nour standing locally?\nReportage of the visit in the Kensington Post is probably as effective in this\nrespect as any donation to the Notting Hill Housing Trust\u2014especially by\nits coincidence with Rag Week. Collections for the whole Carnival\nshould be made easier\u2014and not only in the Royal Borough\u2014by the\npublic's association of IC with the Queen Mother.\nFurther help towards over-reaching our target of \u00a33,000 should be provided by\nChairman Hocking's plans to maintain enthusiasm, especially through the\nclubs, in the Carnival throughout the year. Though no public speaker,\nChris Hocking appears to be a sincere and conscientious organiser.\nHis ideas for a\" continuous\" Carnival instead of the usual one (or two)\nshort-lived twitching(s) deserve support. For it is found to be generally\neasier and more satisfactory to maintain the interest of a nucleus of people\n\u2014who may be endorsed by helpers from the clubs\u2014through the year\nthan to attract a motley group for just one week.\nHowever, the problem that is so created is how to keep Carnival alive. It is far\neasier to organise events for just one week than for upwards of twenty.\nAnd even the Carnival Committee itself is short-staffed; the vacancy for\na public relations officer remains.\nA Tailpiece on Dress\n' T'HE QUEEN Mother's recent visit was made the excuse for one of those\n\u2022*\u2022 rare opportunities when IC students were made to look like members of\na university. While I would be the last to advocate the use of academic\nrobes in lectures\u2014even less in the laboratory or workshop\u2014I do suggest\nthat this form of dress (worn with a dark lounge suit) would be more\ncomfortable and look better at wine hall dinner and on those occasions\nwhich normally demand bow ties and dinner suits.\nCarrespondence\nIndoctrination?\nJ WOULD LIKE to reply to Mr.\nKumar's criticism of Pakistani\nInformation Material, Felix,\nNovember 3rd,1965. The morning edition of \" Dawn,\"\na Pakistani daily, comes to the Union\nb v courtesy of the Pakistan High\nCommission ; fu st as the International\nEdition of the \" New York Times\"\nis supplied by the US Embassy in\nLondon. Most of us see these papers\ntogether with the \" India News,\" published b v the Indian High Commission here, copies of which are\nequally prominently displayed on the\nUnion Premises.\nThe various periodicals, etc., in the\nUnion lounge are for people to read\nat their own leisure and without coercion.

This will\nraise the rents in New Bei*, for\nexample, from \u00a368 to \u00a375 p.a., and in Weeks and Southside from\n\u00a375 to \u00a381 p.a. The purpose is to offset an expected deficit in next year's reserve fund of \u00a31,200, with sufficient margin to stabilise rents for\nseveral years. The cost for guests\nwill be adjusted correspondingly.\nCouncil had a gres d last year\nthat such an increase was in ev it able.

However,\nDeputy President Chris Molam was completely opposed to the idea of total\ndemocracy, although he was prepared to\nsee a similar system, with a veto for\nUnion Council. Fletcher thought this\npointless.\nC LIQ UE\nSimilarly, Barry Mair, &Mike Scott\n(President of RCS) were not in favour\nof free voting (\"Council knows the\ncandidates capabilities better than\nordinary students\") and doubted if there\nwas an oligarchy. But Molam did admit\nthat the present system involves a certain clique. This familiarity of\nmembers of Council with the President's job dies ensure some continuity of government - although even so, according\nto Mair, Fletcher is only now catching\nup with the paper work.\nPaper work occupies most of the\ntime of the Exec., for example, as Deputy President, Mair spent a lot of his\ntime last year putting the Union's views to the College administration -'Placating Stevenson and Seaford etc'\n- though Livesey suggested that a Secretary with a dicta phone would be a useful innovation, also delegation of\nauthority to other members of Council;\nhowever, Mair claims that ALL.members\nof Council ARE working this year -\"Even that nit Needham.\"\nIan Kershaw, RCS Secretary, stated\nthat there was enough apathy in the\nUnion for a group of influential people\nto swing the vote at a Union Meeting,\neven at Council - though, he added,\nthis is less likely. There seems to\nbe a general feeling that a free vote\nwould lead to more people being nominated - however, Scott expressed fears\nof the practice of \"putting up one's mate for a laugh.\"\nThe matter fa free vote to elect\nan IC President has not been discussed\nfor many years.

Eng.Soc .Meetmg.\nA promising future for the gas-turbine engine w&s predicted at the\nEngineering Society on Tuesday, November 9th,, when Mr.P.A. Philips, of the\nRover Car Co,,, lectured on ''The small gas-turbine and its automotive\napplications\".1 Briefly outlining the history of the\\gas-turbine engine as used in road vehicles, Mr. Philips explained that the majority of necessary v'* development work had already been carried out, so that the delay in the\nintroduction of a turbine-cng in ed car was a matter of reducing production\ncosts to a level comparable with those of conventional piston-engines.\nThe speaker described the development of the power unit for the RoverB.R.M, racing car which competed so successfully in the Le Mans 24-hour\nrace in1963 and 1965, winning, on its first entry, a special prize as\nthe first turbine-engined car to complete the 24-hour race at an average\nspeed of 93m,p.h. The primary consideration of design for this engine was re lia bil ty, and that this was achieved was shown by its performance in the latter race\nwhen the car satisfactorily completed the course despite cons i. dera.ble\ninternal damage due to metal failure, Mr, Philips concluded by saying that the increasing range of' app li cat ions of the gas-turbine engine was providing valuable experience in production methods, and he confidently predicted that the gas-turbine\nwould eventually become a superior alternative to the piston engine for automotive use. R.A.D. Twice \"in the past fortnight shattered beer mugs have appeared on the\npath near the bar, outside the Union Building, On the first occ as sion a pint mug was apparently thrown from one of the upper windows of the build ing, narrowly missing a student walking below. Then on Saturday night\n\"somebody\"'1\nthrew a mug through one of the lounge windows. Maybe there is a rational excuse for both incidents but 'enquiries have failed to show\nthis. Student high spirits are one thin^r but endangering others is not funny.\nWe know that the age of students coming to I.C. gets lo iver but this is no\nexcuse for behaviour worthy of a second-former.\nIncidentally I thought the idea behind the \" ladies r bar\" in the lower\nlounge was that it was to be a place where the women of I.C. and other\nfemale guests could be refreshed free from the usual bawdiness that reigns in the main bar. Anyone who has passed through the lower lounge during\nthese past few weeks will have found little evidence of this purpose. It seems to have become an extension of the all male preserve next-door. So\nyou chaps of '\"that club\" and others, unless you have female company, use\"\nthe old bar please; where you may swear and sing to your heart's delight, T.B.

Eventually the\nworld will have to adapt itself to economic stagnation, or there will\nbe total destruction.\nProfessor Gabor of the Electr.'cal\nEngineering Dept, author of \" Invening the Future,\" was talking to Wells\nSoc. on \" The problems of Science\nand Engineering in the Fors sable\nFuture.\"\nHe started with a brief outline of\nH.G. Wells' theories, and went on to\nshow how the approach to engineering\nhad changed since Wells' time, relating this to the changes he considers\nto be necessary in the future.\nPsychologically this world is used\nto exponential increases, but it*must\nsoon slow down or go bust, and the\npopulus must be educated to a higher\nlevel in order to occupy their increasing leisure time in activities beneficial to society. Complete co-opera-tion at all levels is required for advancement towards a world more free\nfrom crime and vice, and a world in\nwhich people can work for their health\n\u2014both mental and physical\u2014rather\nthan for their livelihoods.\nProfessor Gabor finished by giving\nsome examples of the kind of work\nfuture engineers can do with an easy\nconscience. Space and medical research are the two major fields in\nwhich advances can be made to the\nbenefit of the world as a whole, without personal or commercial gains\nbiasing the projects.\nProfessor Gabor will be speaking to\nHuxley Society in December on the\nsubject of \" The threat and promise\nof leisure in an automated society \" \u2014\nit will be interesting to see how he\nexpands his ideas on this point.\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSelected by Paul Smith\nRED CHINA INVADES L.S.E. For the first time since the Communists seized power in 1949, two\nstudents from mainland China have\nentered the London School of Economics this year. They are taking a one\nyear general course.\nHYGIENE SCARE Some students in a Manchester Hall of\nResidence are suffering from an outbreak of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. The Public Health authorities\nare investigating and the Hall has begun a campaign to improve standards\nin the kitchens.\nHIGH SPEED DEMOCRACY This year's Annual General Meeting\nof Nottingham University Union, involving the election of 25 officers,\ntook a record short time of 20 min u tes, including the counting of the\nvotes\u2014in previous years, this has\ntaken up io 2 days.\nMOAT EL?

Brighton union are having a cam rp a ign to create a new-look healthy\nstudent.

As\nthis costs up to \u00a325, it could become\nrather an expensive pastime. This\naction has been taken because the\nlifts have been stuck seventeen times\nso far this session.\nJust One University Needed\n\" BRITAIN ONLY NEEDS one University.\"\u2014This astonishing\nstatement was made by Peter Laslett, M.A., when he spoke in\nthe General Studies on 2nd November. He maintained that electronic communication systems can unite the universities of the\ncountry into one nation-wide community.\nWe need to expand our university\nsystem in a hurry if we are to keep\npace with America and Germany. Al ready we are an under-educated na-tion. The only way to extend our\nuniversity facilities fast enough is to\nput at the disposal of lecturers and\nstudents all the advantages of el ecr onic aids to teaching and learning.\nDespite this, the idea of a\" University of the air \" is a fantasy. Quite\napart from the prohibitive cost (about\n\u00a340 million a year for an institution\nthe size of London University), it is\njust not possible to \" pipe \" knowledge\ncontinuously into students through the\nmedium of television. Mr. Laslett\nproposed that a nation-wide \" open\nsystem\" university should use T.V. for 5 per cent of the time, radio for\n35 per cent, .and the rest of the teaching done by correspondence course.\nThis sort of education, continued\nthroughout people's lives, was the only\nway for the country to stay afloat in\na rapidly changing world.\nMALCOLM ROSSITER\nSTOMP SUCCESS\nJT SEEMS a shame it the Jazz Club can put on a Southside Stomp\nas successful as the one held a fortnight ago, that there are going\nto be no more Stomps this term.

He told me that\nthis was far from being the case\nand that he had never seen so\nmany new groups able to play\nto such a high standard so\nquickly before. The reason was,\nhe said, that up until now it had\nbeen impossible to hear any live,\n\" serious\" jazz played to professional standards within the\ncollege, and that this was being\nrectified at the next two Wednesday night meetings.\nTonight's( Nov. 17th) Concert\nfeatures \"The Ken Gibson Big Band\"\nwhich was formed a few months ago,\nand the Jazz Congress, which, you\nmay remember, played for the Jazz\nand Poetry Session last year.

N.D. and Huxley Society are\nsponsoring a meeting about this topic.\nThe meeting is to be addressed by as\nmany eminent speakers as can be\ndragged from the division lobbies and\nfrom C.A.R.D. The Third World\nTHEY' VE ALWAYS been there\u2014the starving, illiterate mute\npoor of the world ; but they don't feature in history as we know\nit, which is mostly a record of the doings of a well-fed European\nminority. They existed in Europe, too, till the Industrial Revolution gave them power and a voice, and now they have the vote a: J affluence. Now the non-whites, the world's lower classes, are demanding their share of power and |\nwealth. Now they're 70 per cent,\no? the world's population, and\nth /'re getting 44 per cent, of its\nfool. In 2000 they'll be 80 per\nce.ii. of the world, and how much\nfood will they get then ?\nOf the people who live in the\nThird World, 10-15 per cent are undernourished\u2014they just don't get enough\nto eat. Up to half are malnourished'\u2014\nthey don't get the right sort of food.\nThe world's rate of population increase is two per cent per annum\u2014an\nexponential growth that will swamp\nany attempt at economic development\nif left unchecked. For population\ngrowth is not itself a cause of poverty\n\u2014 it was inflicted on already poor\nnations by Western medicine\u2014but\nbirth control is a necessary condition\nfor economic improvement from the\npresent intolerable squalor of the\nworld.\nThe Huxley Society's World Population Week, which begins next\nMonday, features the work of the\nFamily Planning International Campaign, which enlists support in this\ncountry for family planning agencies\nall over the world. Its associated\nagencies work with government assist-ance, in India, Malaya, Indonesia,\nChile and many other countries, and\nwithout government help in many\nothers; it can report substantial success in experiments run in Hong\nKong, Singapore, Bengal and Puerto\nRico. Its associated agencies give\nadvice in all forms of contraception,\nfrom the Pill to the rhythm method.\nA safe, once-a month oral contraceptive is Mankind's best hope for a decent future: it doesn't exist yet, but\na representative from G.D. Searle\nand Co., British manufacturers of\nthe Pill, will talk on the subject and\nshow films.\nThe equally essential factor in the\nrace against famine is development.\nThere are colossal difficulties in the\nway of persuading the subsistence\nfarmer to raise his productivity. The\neffect of modern technology is to draw\nthe ablest, youngest people from the\nland where they are most needed, into\nthe city slums. A representative of\nthe Centre for Urban Studies will\nspeak during the Week.\nThere will be a fixed exhibition in\nthe main entrance of Southside\nduring the Week; this, and the other\nactivities of the period will, we hope,\nprovide the material for a general\ndiscussion of the population problem\non the Friday evening, at which we in\nHuxley Society particularly want to\nhear something of the opinions of\npeople in this college who actually\ncome from developing countries, for\nit's only too easy for outsiders to see\na problem in terms which are inapplicable on the spot.\nTo my mind, a decent standard of\nliving is what modern science and\ntechnology are for\u2014to liberate human\nbeings, all of them, from purely material wants, and to create life from\nliving death.\n\n"

The average IC Union\nmember seems to spend less than\nhalf-an-hour a week at UL U. And he goes to one General\nStudies lecture per three weeks.\nThese are two of the results of a Kanta Pell survey conducted in the\nCo.kg e over the past three weeks by\nNigel Leppard, Far d Hassan, BarbaraHedge, Susan Gibbs and Seng Choa.\nA table cf soma of the results and\ncomments on these and others are\ngiven below.\nUL U also seems to miss out in relation to \" picking up\" a girl (or\nboy, according to sex.) Of the four\ncategories posed UL U was found to\nbe three or four times less popular\nthan hall parties, ICU functions and\nother colleges. Hall parties in fact\nlead the mating stakes by a short\nhead.\nHowever, those who are already\n\" going steady \" seem to want to get\naway from the college or university to\nentertain their regular girl (or boy)\nfriends. But generally going out to\nLondon theatres, cinemas, eun cert s, jazz Ciubs, etc does not seem to be a regular weekly affair for three-quarters of those questioned ; eight people\nclaimed never to seek the bright\nlights.\nOnly six categories of residence are\nquoted in the table below. In the\nquestionnaire eight were considered\u2014\ni.e. halls/hostels, flats/bed sitters, par-ti al board lodgings and home, each\nwithin or outside a three mile radius\nof College. Only six completed\nquestionnaires were obtained for\ntwo of these, so they have been omitted from the table. Columns 3 and\n6 are also liable to more error than\nthe rest owing to lack of information.\nI suspect that there has been a general under estimation of travel times.\nCertainly for students living in IC\nHalls as these have been considered as\nnil. An extra five minutes to each of\nthese figures perhaps gives a truer\npicture.\nCertain advantages of living in\nHall are immediately obvious. The\nhigh representation of club officials in\nHall is attributable to two factors\u2014\n1. That they obtained their places in\nHall because they were club officials;\n2. that by being in Hall they can be\nmore intimately in vo. ved in Union\naffairs and thus arc able to gain office.\nIn sporting activities Hall dwellers\nseem to be twice as active as others.\nLiving at home and looking after\noneself also seem to militate against\nthe student's activity in social and\nrecreational pursuits in IC Union.\nBirds nest Tin\nShin and Eye\nNOW HERE'S ANOTHER tin\nwhich you might find useful.\nIt's Casserole brand stewed steak.\nActually it is tha only Casserole\nbran c\"I 've ever found, and I think\nhas been on the market for\nseveral years. Packed in Ireland,\nand passed by their Department\nof Agriculture,\" the tin contains\nhigh quality beet, no fat, and salt\nonly. It may look a little dry at\nfirst, but you'll find that there is\nno need to add anything, it's delicious with bread or potatoes, but\nyou can, of course, if you feel\nambitious, use it in stew form, together with onions, carrots, tomatoes in a saucepan or in the oven.\nIt is ready cooked, so it would be\nbest to add only cooked or half-cooked vegetables, but obviously\nit takes a lot of the effort out of\nstew making. A small tin, to\ngive you a generous one person\nmeal, is 2s.3d. Beauty on the Cheap\nThis week I thought I would see if\nI could find you some make-up and\nbeauty hints on a budget. There are\ntwo Woolworth's and Boots the\nChemists in the area. One Woolworth's, on the new block in Kensington High Street past the Royal\nGarden Hotel, and another in the\nBrompton Road, opposite Brompton\nOratory. * Both these shops could be\nvery useful, say I, hoping you have\nnot already covered this ground your-self.\nBoots have a large range of their\nbeauty products all round, 4s. first\nsize. These general necessities could\nform your basic make-up wardrobe.\nFoundation, (if you want it) 4s. and\n\"All-in-one,\" a complete make up, 6s.I would especially recommend their\nmoisture cream, 4s.6d., small size,\nfor oily skins too, occasionally, and\nlipsticks, if you like really creamy\nones, 3s.6d. Nail polish is 3s. There are three identical looking bottles all at 4s.6d., containing Skin\nFreshner, Complexion Milk and Toneup Lotion for oily skin types.\nThen they have another range, 365,\nincluding a light hair spray, good for\nsetting too, 5s.6d., talc.
