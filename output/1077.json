    "content": "2 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 31ST JANUARY\nWaterstone's on JANET?\nMICHAEL ROBERTS\nAnother aspect of Waterstone's Bookstore tender has come under\nsuspicion with the revelation that the\ncompany plan to use JANET for\ntheir retail plans. In their tender,\nWaterstone's made a big selling\npoint of their proposed use of the\ninternet, emphasising in particular\nthe ability to order and buy books\nelectronically.\nThe Joint Academic NETwork is\nused by universities, colleges and\nresearch organisations throughout\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland.\nThere are direct links to networks in\nEurope and the USA, through which\nJANET forms part of the Global\nInternet and Special Interest Groups.\nJANET is operated and managed\nby the JNT Association Ltd, a 'not-for-profit' company regulated by\nU KERN A, the United Kingdom\nEducation and Research Networking\nAssociation.\nAccording to UKERNA rules, an\norganisation may gain entry to\nJANET provided it falls into one of\nthe approved categories. It must be a degree awarding institution, an institution that teaches at tertiary level\n(including sixth-form colleges) and\nabove, an institution that conducts\nresearch where a reasonable proportion of the results are placed in the\npublic domain, or a \"learned soci-e ty\". Also accepted are further and\nhigher education funding councils,\nresearch councils or organisations\nwhose primary purpose is the support of education in a capacity other\nthan for commercial gain.\nAccording to Karen Griffin of\nJANET Customer Services,\nWaterstone's have not as yet submitted any application to be allowed to\nuse the network. Furthermore,\ndespite their location within an academic institute, they could still end up\nbeing prohibited from using JANET.\nIt is clear that the new bookstore\nwill be accessible via electronic mail\nand the World Wide Web within the\ninternal Imperial College network. If\nit is to be visible to organisations outside College, it will effectively be\nusing JANET without permission.\nAn internet book ordering service is\nalready operated by the current\nbookstore and the Union's tender\nproposal included a commitment to\ncontinue such a service.\nOUTRAGE!\nPeter Tatchell visits ULU\nIs Outing Justified?\nIQ: 4 Feb, 6.30 Union entrance\nemail: ka.va te s&'ic.a c. ilks. r. cook@, ic.a c.uk Chemistry explosion\ncontinued from front page\nThe incident was reported to the\nHealth and Safety Executive, in\naccordance with regulations, at\n11.15am. Several people present when the\nexplosion occurred, including Dr\nGraham Saville of the ChemicalEngineering Department who was\nan expert advisor on the Piper Alpha\ninquiry, were involved in the initial\ninvestigation. A thorough enquiry\ninto the circumstances of the explosion is currently under way, but as\nyet its exact causes are unknown.\nThe suspect experiment had been\nchecked thirty seconds before the\nincident and nothing appeared to be\namiss with the distillation process.\nIt is suspected that the Teflon seal\non the distillation flask did not fit\nperfectly, allowing ether vapour to\nescape into the fume cupboard. Due\nto some confusion about the two\nelectrical control switches present in\nthe lab, it appears that the cupboard's extraction fan was not turned on,\nallowing the vapour, from whatever\norigin, to build up. The ignition\nsource has not been isolated.\nAccording to Ian Gillett, Safety\nDirector, all those involved were\nextremely helpful, including Schal,\nthe contractors working on the BMS\nbuilding. He said the laboratory\nshould \"realistically be fit for use by\nstudents within about one month\"\nbut it all depends on the insurance\ncompany involved and those who\nwill receive the contract for the\nextensive reconstruction work.\nElsewhere, the water leak that\ncaused temporary power failures in\nthe Library and Sherfield Building\n(as reported in last week's Felix) has\ncome under scrutiny following the\nrevelation by one electrician working\non repairs that water \"had been leaking for some time\" into the generator\nroom. Keith Reynolds, Head of Fire\nand Security, was quick to reassure\nFelix that the leakage had presented\nno danger.\nHeavier rain over the previous few\ndays is thought to have been responsible for the accident.\nNews in Brief\nACC CHAIR RESIGNS\nICU sports clubs were shocked last\nweek by the sudden resignation of\nCaroline Deetjen, the Athletic Clubs\nCommittee Chair.\nMs Deetjen, currently in the final\nyear of her Chemical Engineering\ndegree, explained, \"I felt I was over-committing myself, and wasn't giving the ACC the time and credit it\ndeserved. My work was falling\nbehind, and I felt strained, unhappy\nand dissatisfied with my performance. Something had to give, and\nas I'm here to gain a degree it had to\nbe the ACC.\"\nSarah Corneille, ICU Deputy\nPresident for Clubs and Societies,\nsaid of Ms Deetjen \"We're sorry to\nsee Caroline go, she has done a great\njob until now.\"\nMs Corneille will take over the\npost until the next ACC meeting, at\nwhich the Vice-Chair is expected to\nbe appointed as the permanent\nreplacement.\nBICYCLE THIEF CHARGED Charges have been brought against a man arrested in Ayrton Road shortly\nbefore the Christmas holidays for\ncarrying equipment with the obvious\npurpose of stealing bicycles. The\narrest was made partly based on\ninformation from a student.\nPolice are continuing inquiries\ninto the incident and Security officers are receiving extra training in\ndealing with such occurrences as\nbicycle theft.\nThere are many ways of combatting bicycle theft. Most cyclists in\nLondon own D locks designed to be\nextremely effective against attempts\nto cut through them, but some \"pro-fess ional\" thieves may possess\nequipment to cut through even these.\nCollege security recommend that\nthose who bring bicycles to College\ntake the trouble to leave them at\nfacilities provided for this purpose\nsituated just off the main walkway\nnext to the Royal School of Mines,\nwhich is covered by twenty-four\nhour CCTV surveillance.\nCLAY PONDS BURGLAR\nSENTENCED Last week, a burglar was sentenced\nto five years imprisonment after\nbeing caught breaking into\nClayponds hall of residence in Ealing\nlast term. He was captured and\narrested by College Security as he\nwas making his escape. A second\nburglar, who was caught at the same\ntime, is serving a two-year prison\nsentence.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 31ST IANUARY COLUMNS 11\nPeople these days are obsessed with\nmoney. Not exactly a startling revelation and a bit rich coming from\nyou, I hear you cry. But the interesting thing about the current nature of\nthis obsession is that it does not\nencompass care of money. The public will happily waste, or see wasted,\nenormous sums on pointless activities (such as the lottery), yet apparently play merry hell when relatively\ntrifling projects are proposed.\nAs you probably realised, dear\nreader, I am referring to the replacement for Britannia. At \u00a360 million,\nthis represents about 75 minutes government spending. It is not, as some\nhave suggested, a private plaything\nfor the Royal Family, but a means for\nthe Queen to discharge her duties as\nhead of state, in much the same way\nas Bill Clinton uses Air Force One.\nGiven our strong maritime heritage,\na prestigious British-built yacht\nseems the perfect solution.\nAll talk that this money should be\nspent on education looks pretty flimsy in the light of the \u00a32.5 billion to be\nspent on the cattle cull to satisfy a German food minister who constantly moves the goalposts of lifting the\nban.\nIt also looks weak following the publication of results that show that in\nsome London boroughs, at the age of\nseven, the reading age gap between\nthe best and the worst is up to three\nyears. Spend, spend spend is the\nmantra of both the opposition parties,\nbut this is shown to be ridiculous\nwhen one also reads that the country\nwith the highest standards of English\nin the world is\napparently Barbados, where the average\ngovernment spend per pupil is\nhalf that of the\nUK.\nPathetic basic\nliteracy and\nnumeracy is\ndirectly attributable to 'pr ogres sive' teaching\nmethods, not\nsocio-economic\nfactors; Kensington and\nChelsea, for\ninstance, came\nout below the\nnational average for basic standards\nof pupil ability.\nReading can be taught in a bus\nshelter with a copy of yesterdays\nnewspaper. Since a significant proportion of the teaching 'profession'\nSimon Baker\nmm m;i j fc^..........I Voice of Reason\nare incapable of realising the damage\nof their actions, it is about time that\nstrict guidelines on primary education were introduced. In other words,\nturn the clock back thirty years.\nI try to avoid writing about my own\ndepartment so as not to ignore huge\nswathes of you,\nmy readers, and\nalso to prevent\nstreams of abuse\nfrom my elders\nand betters. Last\nweek's explosion\nin Old Chemistry\ndeserves a men-tion. It is a miracle that no one\nwas killed during\nthe incident,\nwhich, without\ngoing to details,\ngenerated enough force to\nblow a fridge\nthrough a closed door.\nYou would\nnaturally assume that an incident of\nthis nature would warrant a least a phone call to London Fire Brigade to\nexplain what had happened. Not so,\nmy friends. Now as you know by\nnow, I have no truck with cynicism,\nso I won't suggest, as some are say\ning, that this was to prevent the\nHealth and Safety Executive getting\nwind of it. The apparatus that caused\nthe fire is in wide use in the department and has long been seen as an\naccident waiting to happen.\nThe lab in question only had one\nexit. It now, of course, has two, cour\ntes y of the fridge. An earlier request\nfor more fire extinguishers for this\nlab was denied - 'we don't want any\nhave-a go heroes.' In which case\nwhy bother with them at all. I could\ngo on for several pages about\nCollege safety policy, which is more\nabout eliminating liability than eliminating risk, but it would send all but\na few chemists and Sherfield bigwigs\nto sleep. Suffice to say, it does not\nwork.\nFinally, regular readers will have\nwondered if I have gone cold on\nSouthside Bar. I have gone cold in it,\nwhen the heating was on the blink,\nbut the beer remains at the usual\nexceptional standard.\nRecommendations here are fairly\npointless - every pint should be tried\n(though not necessarily at once). If\nyou thought real ale was synonymous with amorous activities in a canoe, then forsake Australian lager\nfor something a little creamier.\nThe Weekly Poem\n(supplied by PoetIC)\nAll his nails were gone\nhe couldn't hang the picture\nhe couldn't eat the cracker,\nhe forgot his name.\nHe hid in the cloakroom\nwhere he wandered for hours\nwith a clock as his sole companion\nOh, his personality was impossibly inflated\nand with a bang!\nhe tiled the walls with his thoughts\nhis emotions, photographs of his life\nbut he could only focus on one.\nThe milk was overflowing\nfrothy and bubbly\nNot like his days!\nA range of different colours\nwere his banner\nhe wore for everyone to see\nhe hated fish but liked looking at their bones\nhe liked looking at the sea.\nabsorbing everything\nor almost everything\ndeep and superficially empty\nHe admired the sea\ncause he could understand it\nand although he knew\nhe could become part of it forever if he wished\nhe wasn't exactly happy with the idea.\nWhen he stopped dreaming\nand we don't know when exactly this happened\nhe clasped his hands together and prayed\nHe dimmed the light and saw his eyes trembling\nIn a cartoon he once read\na page number was missing.\nThat was so clear.\nIt was perhaps more important\nthan the train he missed the other day\nand even more useful.\nBy Stelios\nPoetIC is the creative writing society of Imperial College, and we are always\nhappy to greet new members.

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 31ST IANUARY SPORT 15\nMary's cruise through to Semis As the sun struck the lush green\nfields of a sleepy Chislehurst on a Tuesday afternoon you could cut the\natmosphere with ac liche. The two\nrival camps of supporters gathered to\ncheer on their respective teams.\nWhile UCH ran out looking around\nnervously, Mary's stormed out -focused and full of determination.\nThis attitude continued straight from\nthe kickoff into the match.\nIt was our kick and the forwards\ncharged through to win a ball that\nshould not have been theirs, ruc king impressively to a position in front of\nthe posts. They had no option but to\nkill the ball and Nev slotted away the\npenalty for three points. From the\nrestart there was a similar story and\nNev again put the kick away for six-nil.\nThe third kick-off saw their forwards getting it right and slowed\ndown our drive but only for our\nbacks to break through with Will\nJackson and Ollie Kayes. Faced with\nthis onslaught they infringed again,\nwith Nev opting for the line out this\ntime. From here Tremmor won good\nball and Bill Tuff drove into the heart\nof the UCH defence. As the forwards\nneared the line Phil Sauve at scrum-half showed he too could drive and\nforced the ball over the line.\nAfter dominating for much of the\nfirst quarter UCH started to get back\ninto the game. First of all they tried\nthe direct approach, only to find the\ntackles of Lidely and Jackson a bit\nhard for their liking. The kicking\nstrategy was next employed but\nPlatty, Lee and Rogers were more\nthan a match for it. They managed to\ngain three points, however, after an\ninfringement in the ruc k was\npenal is ed. Their supporters cheered\nthe first points they had scored\nagainst St Mary's for quite a while.\nWhilst their celebrations continued we got back into the task at hand.\nBan and Tremmor won good balls\nfrom line out s and Tufty and Sankey\nwere both clearing and driving.\nSome incisive running from Ollie\nsent Simon Rogers away to score\nnext to the posts.\nThe half ended with brief\nexchanges between the two sides,\nwith UCH beginning to play with\nmore urgency, but our line never\nwavered. The only bad points were\nanother penalty for them and Ollie\nhaving to go off with a broken nose.\nRob Elliot replaced him and did a fine job starting where Ollie had left\noff.\nThe second half started with some\nmore power play from our forwards,\nbut as it progressed things again\nbecame more frantic as befits a cup\nmatch. They pressed again and won\nanother penalty. The only highlight\nof this half was another run from\nRoger - breading through the line\nfrom full-back to settle the match\ntwenty-five to nine.\nWe progress to the semi-finals\nknowing that arch-rivals Charring\nCross will play no farther part in the\ncompetition as they crashed out thirty to eight against UMDS.\nSt Mary's259 UCH\nFatboy crowned King\nWith the football seconds looking to\nbuild on last weeks glorious victory,\nthe game began with captain Steve\npicking a formation literally out of a hat and urging the lads to \"Show 'em\nwhat we can do\". Unfortunately this\nproduced the most boring first half in\nhistory, with all concerned agreeing\nthe we were \"worse than the Villa\"\n[Arsenal, surely - Sports Eds].\nThe second half saw the arrival of\nDave who replaced Andy, and Dixon\nwho Steve enticed onto the pitch\nwith the promise of pies. With the\nsun at our backs and the wind in our\nhair (Phil's, by the smell of it) we\ntore into King's with Loz, Felix and\nSi all going close. The defence\nlooked sound, with German breaking\nlegs whenever he felt it was necessary and Rob playing a blinder at\nright back. Dixon was having none\nof this, however, and he combined\nbeautifully with Donal in goal to let\nSteve through to score his second\nown goal in two games. Bloater\ncould not be denied his glory as he\nsummoned up his inner qi and calmly stroked the ball with the King's defenders nowhere to be seen. This\nwas followed up by a flick-on to\nMartin who put the ball into the net\nafter kicking their keeper in the teeth.\nGood work fella!\nIC lis 2 - 1 King's College lis\nSPORT SHORTS:\nRSM Rugby beat Heathrow in a show of youthful vigour and pure\naggression in the face of tough\nopposition.\nWith all the London league BUSA\nmatches over (and won) the men's fencing team now face their first\ndirect elimination BUSA match on\nthe February 5th against\nNottingham University.\nTHE LATEST SCORE Introducing a new regular \"external\" sports column by\nthe ever talented and good-looking Dave Robinson.\nEngland have now managed just two\ntest victories in five winter tours and\nboth of those when the series were\nlost and Australia and the West\nIndies had already given up. This\nappa ling record was furthered earlier\nthis week when England failed to\nwin. Unlike most I don't think that\nthis is an easy tour. Zimbabwe or\nNew Zealand away was always\ngoing to be tough, but we should\nhave enough killer instinct to wipe\nout anyone who slips up.\nEngland's attack on the first day\nand in the late stages of New\nZealand's second innings was\nabysmal. Even Atherton himself\nadmitted it was the worst his side had\never bowled. But shouldn't he have\nbeen more assertive in attacking?\nCouldn't he have surrounded the\nheroic Danny Morrison with at least\nsix fielders when Tuffnell bowled?\nSurely he should have instructed\nMullaly to give the tail end the kind\nof treatment dished out to us by the\nWest Indies in 1994? Two 90 mph\nbouncers an over would have softened them sufficiently. And if\nEngland's best couldn't dispose of\nthe world's worst test batsman',\nthen why didn't he have an over or\ntwo himself? At least then he could\nsay he that he had tried everything.\nInstead after the match he spouted on\nabout the match not being won til the\nwinning runs are struck. Shouldn't he have explained this to his team\nrather than soldiering on hoping to\nknock them over eventually?\nCaptains should make things happen\nrather than wait for them.\nThe obvious upshot from\nEngland's failure over the last few\nseasons is to relieve Atherton of the\ncaptaincy and change the squad.\nUnfortunately unlike football and\nrugby all of England's best are\nalready selected. There are no natural replacements for any of the post\nt ions, the only candidate for captain\nwith experience would be Stewart\nand his dips in form make Atherton\nlook consistent.\nSadly, it looks likely that the tests\nin Wellington and here next summer\nwill follow a similar script with\nAtherton, like Gooch, not going until\nthe Ashes are lost at home.\nEven worse than national humiliation down under is the proposed plan\nfor a two up two down system for\npromotion to football's Premiership.\nAlthough I never saw the Football\nLeague do any favours for\nKidderminister, Macclesfield or\nStevenage, I do have some sym pa thy. The best in the First Division are\nbecoming stronger than those at the\nbase of the top flight. Barnsley\nBolton and Sheffield United all play\nbetter than the bottom half and would\ngive West Ham, Southampton and\nMiddlesborough a run for their con\nside r able riches. The British system\nrelies on the realisation of aspirations\nand hopes. Any attempts to stifle this\nwill create a less interesting national\ngame. Any team out of the race will\nsee gates and funds plummet. The\nteams up there have had a windfall\nthat effectively cuts off all but the\nclubs managed by geniuses. If the\nentry is reduced to two a season the\nbest players will stay in reserve\nteams rather than drop down a divi\nsion with the prospect of promotion\nand consequently any side that goes\nup will do a Swindon, conceding\nover a hundred goals and getting\nonly a handful of points. The only\nconsolation is that the football league\nwill be able to say no - but will they\nhold out with the huge financial bribe\nthe big clubs can and no doubt will\noffer in an attempt to buy security?\nThrice-conquering hockey babes kick butt\nIt was muddy, it was cold and it was\nshite, but the ladies firsts were out\nthere on a grass pitch at Royal\nHolloway to fight for a place in the\nfinal of the UL plate. Half time\napproached with no goals scored but\nthat's not surprising as half the team\n- especially Basil - spent most of the\ntime in the puddles on their bums.\nThe second half included one\nextremely beautiful slide tackle from\nSarah Corneille (!) and in the last\nfive minutes our star player, Lucy\n\"Humming bird\" Robinson, got the\nwell deserved goal. One-nil for the\nIC and off to the finals we go.\nIC I10 Royal Holloway I Next was the league match against\nQMW. Great hockey from the for-wards, great hockey from the mid-field, great hockey from the backs\nand Laura I'm sure you would've\nbeen great if the ball had come your\nway.

A common misconception of student welfare is a bizarre combination of\nmeetings of lily live red liberals trying to make the world a happier place and earnest professionals trying\nto help individuals whose lives have gone into meltdown. However, welfare is not about rampant idealism\nand the afflicted, it affects us all in some way or other. It covers many things, such as not having to succumb to peer pressure to have that extra beer; a ruined evening because of an obnoxious individual or\ngroup; a regretted one night fumble with a persistent stranger; drugs; harassment; work; health; exercise\nand education. It impacts, in one way or another, on us all.\nThis year's Welfare Week is based on the broad theme of prejudice and how it affects everyone.\nThe programme of events is intended to address those prejudices which predominate at a multicultural,\nconservative, male-dominated institution such as Imperial.\nThe week starts off with a debate \"Is Science more Homophobic than Art?' We have two guest\nspeakers Andrew Hodges and Matthew Parris. This will be taking place in dBs at 12:30 on Monday. On\nTuesday night the popular weekly quiz held in Da Vinci's will have a distinctly welfare theme.\nAt 12:30 in dBs on Thursday there will be a panel debate along the theme \"When does Flirting\nbecome Harassment?\" The guest speaker will be Ms Collier, author of a book on sexual harassment and\nnow Head of Equal Opportunities at Croyden Council. All proceeds from the door on Friday night will be\ngiven to Nightline, the ULU sponsored telephone advice service. There will also be a stall in the Union\nfoyer between 12:00 and 14:00 every day throughout the week offering, information on all sorts of welfare issues.\nSo come along to the events, whatever side of the fence you are on, and express your views. Your\nattendance and input is valuable in making these events worthwhile, rather than a stuffy fluffy pointless\nexercise in idealism.\nICU Welfare Committee\n\n"

This\nhad been done in other halls before,\nand poor workmanship led to the collapse of the ceiling and water leaking\nbadly all over the floor. There is also\nSpeaking to Felix, Head of\nAccommodation Sharine Brown\nacknowledged the enormous inconvenience to students that this change\nwill cause. Plans to provide a limited\nnumber of in-house machines during\nthe transition period are under con-side ration, and the College will offer\naffected students a refund to cover\nwashing expenses. Recognising that\nsome students might find the level of\nrefund insufficient, Ms Brown\nclaimed she would be prepared to\ndiscuss this matter with those concerned on an individual basis.\nAnother concern of Wilson House\nresidents has been the lack of a freezer in each kitchen, contrary to the\ndescription given in the Residents'\nHandbook. Ms Brown admitted that\nit would be impossible to equip\nevery kitchen with its own freezer by\nthe end of this year due to a lack of\nthe problem of getting the mix of\nwater right at the tap.\" A new shower has been installed in one house,\nwhich serves as a trial for all future\ndevelopments.\nAlso high on the agenda for\nWilson House is the need to improve\nsecurity. Current suggestions include\nthe installation of a swipe card system and closed-circuit camera sur-veil lance. Officials are currently\nassessing the cost of improvements,\nwith 24 hour security provision, by\nfar the most expensive option, still\nconsidered a possibility. Mrs Brown\nrefuted suggestions that provisions\nsuch as washing up liquids and\nkitchen towels have been withdrawn\nin order to fund new security equip-ment, explaining that these measures\nwere taken merely to bring Wilson\nHouse in line with all other halls of\nresidence of Imperial College.\nSchool leave rs opt for physics\nPAUL SQUIRES\nImperial College's Physics department has seen an unexplained\nincrease in the number of applicants\nfor undergraduate degree courses.\nThis has been reflected at a national\nlevel.\nThis increase has occurred despite\ndecisions by many leading universities to axe their physics degrees.\nBirkbeck College, London, and East\nAnglia, Coventry, De Montfort, and\nManchester Metropolitan\nUniversities are all cutting back on\nphysics courses, in accord with\ndownward trends in the subject's popularity over recent years. The\nUniversity and College Admissions\nService, UCAS, reports that the\nnationwide numbers of physics\napplicants represents an increase as\nhigh as 18% compared to last year,\nwhile Dr R Burns, IC Physics\nAdmissions Tutor, believes the\nincrease is in the region of 10-15% at\nImperial. This increase appears to be\npeculiar to physics, no comparable\nincrease having been observed in any\nother scientific discipline with the\nexception of Chemistry, which has\nseen a slight rise.\nThe state of physics in Britain's Universities has recently been the\nsubject of much pessimistic reporting by the media, which have made\nmuch of the cuts imposed by the\naforementioned institutions. Prof B Morgan, Deputy Head of the Physics\nDepartment, pointed out that almost\nall those colleges axing physics are\ncomparatively new institutions.\nNone of them, Prof Morgan claims,\nare noted for their research in this\nfield, and therefore they receive very\nlittle research funding. This reduces\nthe cost-effectiveness of employing\nlecturers to teach physics. Their decisions should not, Prof Morgan\nbelieves, be considered indicative for\nthe physics departments of institutions such as Imperial, which have an\nexcellent reputation in this field.\nHead of the Physics Department,\nProfessor D Southwood, professed\nhis regrets that industry in general\ndoes not recognise the importance of\nphysics in a technically advanced\nmarket. Professor Morgan agreed\nthat physics as a discipline is comparatively remote from industrial\nneed, as advances in pure physics\ntake many years before they are any\nuse in industry, by which time they\nare more likely to be considered\nengineering.\nAs a result, physics research tends\nto receive very little support from\nprivate firms. Several years ago the\ngovernment introduced the ROPA\naward system by which departments\ncan claim funding from the government in proportion to the amount\nthey have received from industry.\nInitially the system did not favour\nphysicists, though this has been\naddressed by the efforts of many professors and the Institute of Physics.\nThe two main forms of Higher\nEducation funding are teaching funding and research funding. Both types\nof grant come from HEFCE, the\nHigher Education Funding Council\nfor England, and in both categories\nphysics has fared badly. Teaching\nfunding is based on student intake,\nwhich is low for physics, while\nresearch funding is based on the\nnumber of teaching staff in the\ndepartment. This is also low compared to other disciplines, although\nIC's physics department has not been\nseriously affected; HEFCE does not\nrequire that the money allocated per\ndepartment be spent solely upon that\nparticular faculty, and it is Imperial\nCollege policy to distribute funds\nequally between the various depart-ment s. Only three\ndays left\nto enter!\n\n"

    "content": "12 COLUMNS & LETTERS FELIX FRIDAY 31ST JANUARY\nWestminster Eye\nHamish Common\n\"Infotainment\" is one of those vogue\nwords that, along with \"information\nsuperhighway\" and \"cyberspace\"\nhave always made me cringe.\nWhereas the latter are not within the\nscope of this column, \"infotainment\"\nis already hitting our television\nscreens and newspapers, with an\narray of spin-doctors and PR men to\nshore it up. In the last few days, our\nnewspapers were filled with stories\nsuch as Branson's balloon trip and\n'Superwoman' Nicola Horlick's sacking from Morgan Grenfell.\nBranson is the master of PR: we were\nenthralled by pictures of balloons\nand desert, fed with statistics about\nthe balloon's dimensions, and shown\nmaps of the intended route. The actual voyage lasted a day or two, around\nthe same time as the other two con-tenders, indeed Branson's team had\nforgotten to bring any loo roll with\nthem. Nicola Horlick's sacking had\nreceived little press coverage until\nshe hired the services of Anthony\nCardew, the City's top spin doctor.\nShe then stormed into her old office\nwhere a group of hacks just happened to be waiting and jetted off to\nthe head office at Frankfurt. It certainly had the desired effect:\nWeekend papers were delighted to\nshow a pretty woman being mistreated by a big nasty organisation, devoting little time to discussing the reasons why the million-pound-a year\nfund manager had been suspended.\nSo what has all this to do with pol-it ics? With increasing commercial is ation and competition within the\nmedia industry, ratings are the ultimate arbiter of success, and the truth\nwill rarely get in the way of a good\nheadline. By targeting the lowest\ncommon denominator among its\naudience, tabloid-style stations and\npapers can reap rich financial\nrewards, attracting the envy of those\nwith more substantial budgets for\nlegitimate news-gathering. News\ndepartments have moved from loss-makers to profit centres, with the\nemphasis on images and audiences\nover prestige, with television news in\nparticular never able to substitute for\na good newspaper: whilst it is\nunbeaten in its ability to present the\npeople and places in the news, its\nactual volume of news is minute. The\nnumber of words spoken in a half\nhour broadcast would barely fill two-thirds of a broadsheet page. Facts are\ncompressed, arguments clipped to\nsize and explanation reduced, all to\nfit within television's restrictive\ntime-frame. Sitting in the public\ngallery during Prime Minister's Question Time I would occasionally\nhear Tony Blair suddenly rant away\non a completely different issue from\nwhatever was being discussed at the\ntime. This confused me at first, until\nI saw him on the 6 o 'clock news that\nevening, with 5 seconds of him ranting away. He was shown on every\nchannel and every news broadcast\nthat night, each with the identical 5\nsecond clip. He had never really been\naddressing the House that afternoon,\nand the publicity his comments\nreceived did him no harm at all.\nSoundbite journalism is unable to\npresent the electorate with any realistic view of events. The public\nbecome used to flashy headlines and,\nfor the most part, have no wish to\nlook too far beyond them. When, last\nWednesday the Guardian correctly\nreported that Labour intended to\nchange the BBC's constitution to\nstrip governors' powers, it was headlined as \" BBC faces upheaval in\nLabour plan\". The spin masters\nthrew tantrums because they didn't like the word \"upheaval\" in a headline (it would not give the appropriate Labour image) and set about rubbishing the story. It is disturbing to\nsee such an pa lava over one word in\na broadsheet headline, but this is the\nimage-over-substance reality that is\nunfortunately seeping across the\nAtlantic.\nI do hope that television networks\nand newspaper magnates make their\nbig money from entertainment, keeping the lure of simple profit away\nfrom the newsroom, as any shallowness here will tempt people to form\ntheir opinions purely upon the headlines and front stories, upon the\npolitician's personalities or upon polished images. They will be fair game\nfor the spin doctors, with their opinions on the significant issues of the\nday decided for them behind closed\ndoors, in advance, with a handshake.\nLETTERS TO FELIX\nreplied to by David Roberts\nThe many-splendour ed joys of College planning\nTo whom this may concern,\nI am writing to complain about the\nplanned closure of the library in the\nmornings in two weeks in February.\nAs this fortnight coincides directly\nwith the week of the second year\nBiology and Biochemistry exams\nand it also covers the week that the\nfinal year Biologists have been granted a reading week, I am beginning to\nfeel that the reliance of the Biology\nand Biochemistry students have\nupon the library is not appreciated.\nThe students of the Life Sciences\nare often required to spend long\nhours in the library as lectures and\npracticals frequently need to be supported by journal articles, not to\nmention the background reading that\nis required for essays, dissertations,\nprojects etc. I am sure that you will\nunderstand that to photocopy all of\nthese articles is extremely expensive.\nI feel that a closure of the library is\nparticularly unfair on the Life\nSciences students: we do not have a departmental library and many of us\nfind that the current opening hours\nare restrictive - it is a little ridiculous\nthat we are allowed to work within\nour own department until 11 pm, but\nwe are only allowed to consult textbooks until 9pm. We have been continually disrupted with closures of the library occurring at short notice, plus the noise\nand even the workmen themselves\ncan be an annoying distraction. I doubt that my degree will be compensated for by the lack of facilities\navailable. Perhaps the library could\ncompensate for the time lost during\nthe building work by either staying\nopen later during the next few weeks\nor by transferring journals from the\nlibrary to a room within the Biology\ndepartment whereupon they would\nbe accessible to all students?\nI understand that the library is\nbeing run for all students and that the\nbuilding work will improve the situation for future students. However,\nwith less than two months to go\nbefore the final exams, I doubt that\naltruistic behaviour will be found\nbeing exhibited freely amongst the\nstudents. Many of us are working\nextremely hard at least twelve hours\na day to try and ensure the results\nthat we need. It would be a shame is\nsome students were not allowed to\nachieve their aims if they were\ndenied the facilities that have been\noffered to students of previous years\nand will be offered to students of\nfuture years.\nYours Faithfully,\nThe letter is signed by 72 members\nof the Biology Department, and a copy has also been sent to the\nlibrary.\nThe wisdom of College's decision\nto halve the library's opening\nwould certainly seem a little sus-pec t, though I imagine that almost\nevery week is important to at least\none department. Certainly it\nwould seem common sense to\nmove some of the more important\npublications to a more readily\naccessible site for the duration.\nHowever, the shut-down will no\ndoubt be worth the sacrifice\n(assuming that this time the building work doesn't result in falling\nmasonry, a leaky roof, power fail-ure s....) A matter of faith\nDear Felix,\nIn response to Karen Yates' article\nA Bunch Of Poofters that appeared\nin Felix 1076, I'd like to make a few\npoints about her statement that \"The\nBible condemns same sex relations\"\nis a common argument \"against\ngays, lesbians and bisexuals\" that\n\"...can be easily countered\".\nFirstly, I do not think that this constitutes an argument at all against\nhomo/bi-sexuality unless the person\nin question is someone who would\ncall him/herself a Christian.\nOtherwise why would someone who\ndoes not believe that God has\nrevealed Himself to us through the\nhistory recorded in the Bible care\nwhat this book, believed by\nChristians to be the \"Word of God\",\nhas to say?\nAs for the issue of whether the\nBible really does condemn same sex\nrelations, I believe that in the Bible,\nGOD condemns same sex relations\nin no uncertain terms from the opening pages when He creates Adam\nand Eve to the end when the body of\nbelievers are referred to as the \"Bride\nof Christ\". Moreover I believe that,\ncontrary to what Karen wrote, the\nwhole Bible, \"original Hebrew\nScriptures\" included, is self-cons is tent with the view that all sexual relations (homosexual or heterosexual)\noutside marriage are wrong in God's eyes.\nWith regard to the New Testament\ncondemnation of homosexuality by\nSt Paul, Karen wrote that \"the writings of St. Paul are believed to be\nmainly personal opinion...\" Even if a Christian chose to believe this how\n\n"

The s abb elections are back!\nThe annual round of Imperial\nCollege Union Sabbatical Elections\nare nearly upon us once again with\npapers for nominations going up on\nMonday. Nominees for the four sabbatical posts must sign up on the\npapers with a proposer and twenty\nsecond ers before they are taken\ndown on Friday 14th February.\nLast year's Sabbatical Elections\ndeveloped into an exciting race\nbetween the three candidates for both\nthe position of President, and that of\nDeputy President (Clubs and\nSocieties). The other two sabbatical\npositions, Deputy President (Finance\nand Services) and Felix Editor, only\nhad a single nominee each.\nSpeculation as to who will put their\nnames forward for this year's Elections has been rife, with a number of pos sib li ties being flagged by\nthe chattering classes around cam-pus. However, no one has firmly said\nthat they will stand for a post though\nearly nominations will no doubt\nThe usual suspects. Who will next year's sabbatical officers be? Up for grabs are Felix Editor, Deputy President\n(Clubs & Societies), Deputy President (Finance & Services) and President\nappear next week.\nA nominee for a sabbatical post\nmust be a full member of Imperial\nCollege Union and can be at any\nstage of their studies. The position\nentails taking a year off from study\nand working as one of the Union's \u2022executives'. The sabbaticals (other\nthan the Felix Editor) oversee the\nday-to-day running of the Union, initiate and implement policy and act as\nthe students' representatives on various external bodies, including\nCollege committees.\nAny full member of the Union\nmay vote in the election. Ballot\nboxes will located in the larger\ndepartments, the Sherficld building\nfoyer and the Union building. An\noption to reopen nominations for a new election is also presented to voters on the ballot slips.\nAfter the nomination papers come\ndown, campaigning begins. Candidates are subjected to a hustings\nboth on the South Kensington site\nand again at St Mary's Medical\nSchool Union.\nThe Election takes place on\nMonday 3rd and Tuesday 4th of\nMarch in a campus-wide ballot and\nthe results are announced on\nTuesday evening.\nAs usual, Felix will be producing a special election issue to announce\nthe result.\nStudent staff rally for campaign\nROBIN RILEY\nPart-time student staff of Imperial\nCollege Union met in dB's on\nWednesday, to hear Union executives outline their plans for the future\nof the organisation in the light of the\nloss of the bookstore.\nUnion Manager Mandy Hurford\nand Events and Marketing Manager\nMark Home addressed a large audience consisting students employed\nby Union trading outlets, including\nthe bookstore, newsagent, print unit,\nbars and catering as well as Union\nstewards and DJs.\nMs Hurford only briefly reiterated\nthe potential problems presented by\nthe loss of the tender, concentrating\ninstead upon the benefits of a positive approach. If the Union's remaining trading outlets are to prosper, Ms\nHurford explained, the students that\nthey employ must maintain a high\nlevel of service and customer care.\nThe Union Manager pointed to the\nincreasing success of the trading out-lets, claiming that much of their efficiency arose from their low staffing\ncosts as compared to other UK stu-dents' unions. Ms Hurford left her\naudience in no doubt as to the purpose of trading outlets, asserting that\n\"We're out to make a profit. We're\nnot ashamed of that... but we're open\nabout those profits going to clubs,\nsocieties and other Union services.\"\nStudent staff, Ms Hurford\nbelieves, should be in the front line\nin promoting the Union. The loss of\nfurther trading outlets would almost\ncertainly result in the loss of part-time jobs for Imperial College stu-dents. Attempting to rally the troops,\nthe Union Manager stated: \"One of\nthe things we don't do very well is\nsell ourselves... We've got to say\nloudly and extremely proudly; This is\nwhat we are, this is what we do - The\nIC Union.\"\nImperial College Union's usually\nflamboyant Events and Marketing\nManager, Mark Home, began his\naddress a little more downbeat. \"The\nUnion has been as guilty as the\nCollege in retreating into its ivory\ntower and not communicating.\" He\nadmitted, after a quick poll showed\nthat only a tiny fraction of those present had known about the bookstore\ntender before the decision was\nannounced. Mr Home continued:\n\"We let you down by not telling\nyou... We don't want to be telling lies\nor spreading rumours, but from now\non we're going to keep everyone\ninformed.\"\nWhen several student staff proposed that Felix be exploited to promote the Union's cause, the executive were quick to point out that\nalthough the Union funds the student\nnewspaper, it has no editorial control.\nThe Union can only campaign directly in Felix through the placing of\nadvertisements.\nMr Home went on to suggest that\nother areas of Union activity may be\nunder threat, reporting that the Union\nwas currently in disagreement with\nthe College over issues such as the\nuse of space in Beit Quad, catering in\nthe JCR and the funding of the\nCommemoration ball. \"We've a few\nmore fights on our hands yet.\" Mr\nHome warned, but remained optimistic about the Union's continued\nexpansion and success; \"There's been a fantastic turnaround, especially in the last two or three years.\"\nRegarding the Union's ongoing\nawareness campaign, The Events and\nMarketing Manager claimed to have\nplans \"...far beyond posters.\"\nMr Home explained \"I'm not saying we bum down the Rector's offices\" but briefly outlined some\naudacious schemes to raise the profile of the Union and its activities. Ms\nHurford, meanwhile, drew attention\nto the success of more conservative\nmeans of protest such as letters to\nCollege governors. The Union\nManager conceded that \"IC's student\npopulation is hardly known for outrageous acts of militancy.\"\nThe meeting was attended by\naround eighty students and staff,\nalthough some sc ep tics later suggested that the high level of attendance\nmay have been because it counted\ntowards student workers' overtime.\nNevertheless, all those present\npledged to support to any campaign\nadopted by the Union executive.\n\n"

Several windows in the lab and\nin adjacent rooms were shattered and\nmuch of the ducting system leading\nfrom the fume cupboard through to\nthe roof also suffered substantial\ndamage.

This was in part due to the\nfire-alarm system in the Tilden Lab\nnot being connected to the alarms in\nthe rest of the building because of an\nearlier failure of the temporary battery back-up system for the other\nalarms. This in turn had been in operation for only eight hours because of\nan electrical fault in the Library when\nthe fuse box fused.

However\nwith so many issues being discussed,\nsuch as including 'Union' in the\nname of all clubs, it appears to me\nthat something is missing.\nNobody seems to be thinking of\nthe Union as a representative body:\nsomething to voice not only our academic worries but general concerns\nabout life at IC. I'm not so much saying that there is nobody around to\nspeak up for us, more that the majority of us can't see that there is.\nBeing excluded from the Fantasy\nSabbatical League I'm forced to fan-t as is e about what would make my\nideal Sabb . . . someone who know's that ICU is not the representative\nbody it should be, someone who\ncares enough to make this a priority,\nand - most importantly - someone\nwho's determined to do something\nabout it.\nICU's biggest nightmare should-n't be that it is unable to trade; it's that it doesn't fulfil a true representative role, making it irrelevant to the\nstudent population that it exists to\nlook after.\nYours etc\nOily Newman (Civil Eng 4)\nTaken for granted?\nDear Felix,\nIt's good to see Imperial students\ngetting involved in the debate on\nhigher education funding (Simon\nWistow, Felix 1076).\nI was interested to see that in the\n'Options for Change' box there was\nno mention of a funding scheme\nwhich I believe to be the best option:\nA return to a full grant at 1979 levels.\nObviously Mr Wistow no longer\nconsiders this to be an option. The\nstudent population is getting too carried away with 'new realism' that we\nare beginning to question our own\nrights. We should have the right to a free education, no matter what.\nYours Sincerely,\nG Constantinid.es\nApology\nDear Mr Feakes\nI would like to express my concern about the report in Felix today\n[24th January] about Richard\nParker's death, especially inaccuracies in the article.\nThe specific inaccuracy that most\nconcerns me is that Richard is said to\nhave gone to \"a business lunch in his\ndepartment on 20 December\". There\nwas no business lunch in the\nBiochemistry Department that day\nand Richard was not drinking in the\nDepartment, as implied.\nI would also like to comment that\nit is regrettable that the article\nattempts to give such detail of the\nevents preceding Richard's death.\nWith best wishes,\nDavid Chapman\nThe News Editor replies: We apologise for the minor factual inaccuracy - Mr Parker had in fact been\nat a business lunch with his com-p any. Details of Mr Parker's last\nday were included to shed some\nlight on his motivations.\nLetters may be edited for length.\nThe guest editor's opinions are not\nnecessarily those of the editor.\nDeadline for letters in Felix 1078\nis Tuesday 7th February.Letters\nmay be e mailed to our address:\nfelix@ic.ac.uk\nIt is perhaps a little ironic that a notice announcing the temporary\nclosure of the Library should sit so\nclose to a letter condemning it. The\ntiming of this stage of the Library's development is also unfortunate\ncoming so soon after another closure\nof half the Library due to an electrical fault earlier this week. Together,\nthese closures put extra pressure on\nLibrary users who may have exams\nin the coming weeks.\nPresumably the scheduling of\nworks in the Library is done in\nadvance, so why was such an inappropriate time chosen? It reminds\nme of similar situation at the end of\nlast year when Weeks Hall residents\nwere treated to a cacophony of\nbuilding noise and disruption in the\nweek proceeding the summer\nexams. The building work was not a major concern; a path was being laid\nto connect the north side of Prince's Garden's to a newly purchased piece\nof land behind Weeks. In order that\nthe path be ready for a garden party\nto mark the opening of the new plot,\nthe path had to be completed during\nthe revision period of the residents.\nThey were not impressed and\nmade their feelings known to various members of the College hierarchy. Their disquiet went so far as to\nadvertising the internal telephone\nnumber of Ian Caldwell about the\nHall along with an encouragement\nto use it.\nEventually, the College agreed to\na rebate on the residents' rent for the\ndisturbance, which accounts for disruption to the students as residents,\nbut not academically wise.\nHowever, in the current situation I think some form of compensation to\nthose put out by the Library's closure is unlikely. It would be difficult\nin any case to identify who should\nreceive r enumeration, but also how\ncan the effect of the missing\nresource be quantified and the result\napplied to exam scores?\nThe biologists who have signed\nthe letter have a valid point - the closure is going to affect them - but in\nthe absence of any suitable compensation. I would recommend that you\ntake as many books out as possible.\nProduced for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board.\nPrinted by Imperial College Union Print Unit, Beit Quad, Prince Consorl Road,\nLondon SW7 2BB.

    "content": "16 SPORT FELIX FRIDAY 31ST JANUARY\nFELIX SPORT\nGoldies flattened by double Dekker\nOn the 22nd of this month, IC football seconds produced a stunning\nsecond half performance to win a game that Goldsmith's led by four\ngoals to one at the interval. A strike\neither side of half time by Dekker,\nthe Dutch Destroyer, and four second half goals ensured that IC took\nall three points and gave their dim\npromotion aspirations a flicker of\nhope.\nWith goalkeeper Cook making his\nsenior debut and the heart of defence\nfalling victim to flu, captain Fleming\nhad to shuffle the pack and come up\nwith a formation that could thwart a fast and physical Goldsmith's line-up. The unfamiliarity at the back\ncaused IC problems and in a sweeping move Goldsmiths scored their\nfirst. From the centre IC immediately started their usual fluid passing\nand within five minutes had levelled\nthrough Dekker with a clinical shot\njust inside the post from outside the\nbox.\nThis perhaps should have precipitated IC's ascendancy, instead the\ndefence pressed the self-destruct but-ton. Cook was the first culprit - poor\nhandling from a bread-and-butter\nshot gave the centre forward the ball\nwho finished from a seemingly\nimpossible angle. Next was Fleming\n- from a lofted, defence-splitting ball\nhe found himself under pressure\nfrom the forward and lobbed the\nadvancing Cook from fully twenty-five yards out. A spectacular effort,\nunfortunately in the wrong goal!\nSoon afterwards in left-back Siverns\nfound himself in near identical circumstances and, so as not to be outdone by his captain, lobbed Cook\nagain.\nThe second half was a different\nstory. Goldsmiths hardly touched the\nball as it was stroked about the pitch\nby the reds. The defence was as tight\nas a vice; the midfield masterful with\nUbogu winning everything; the strikers a constant menace to the bewildered Goldsmith's defence. Soon the\npatience and pressure produced a goal - a loose ball came to Ferguson\non the edge of the area, he dropped a shoulder and floated it beautifully\ninto the top corner.\nMinutes later IC were awarded a heavily disputed indirect free-kick\nfrom six yards after a back pass.\nShanidze touched it to Dekker who\nrifled it above the heads of the players on the line.\nStill the pressure continued\nunabated and still Goldsmiths found\nno answer. An high corner from\nSchroeder was headed down,\ntowards goal by Ubogu. Dunsby, in\nthe thick of the action as he had been\nthroughout, received it; turned and\nshot all in one motion - doubling his\naccount for the season and squaring\nthe game at four each.\nBoth teams by now sensed the\ninevitable and when the ball came to\nArchbald in the Goldsmith's area\nminutes from time he efficiently\nstuck it away and finished the match.\nThe seconds: first for class, first for\nentertainment.\nIC lis 5 - 4 Goldsmiths\nIC Skiing Team excel - at last\nDespite a lot of bad luck in the past\nfew races, the IC Ski Team came\nfighting back last Saturday evening\nwith a strong team performance.\nDan Figueras Niero, Rufina Emo,\nNick Hursemax, Alex Cherdel and\nXavier Grosliebe travelled up to\nHemel Hempstead to participate in\nthe \"Huskies\" race and achieved\nsome excellent results with some\ninspired individual efforts.\nThe race consisted of two individual, timed runs down a slalom\ncourse; followed by a team dual\nslalom. In the individual slalom,\nRufina was placed first in her age\ncategory despite a blunder by the\norganisers in believing that we were\nfielding a male team, and second\noverall in the ladies with a total time\nof 35 seconds exactly, whilst Nick\nwas placed second in his category\nwith a time of 33.96s. Furthermore\nthe team won the individual combined slalom event with a total time\nof 140.68s and were placed second in\nthe team dual slalom. These impressive results are a definite boost to\nteam morale. Keep it up lads and\nRufina!\nTeam Combined Slalom: 1st Team Dual Slalom: 2nd The fourths go marching on...\nAs usual, we won, they lost.\nHowever, they didn't just lose, they\nbore the brunt of the fourth's most\nimpressive performance this season,\nand were thrashed into submission\nby a team seemingly possessed by\nthe spirit of Brazil 1970.\nThe pressure built in the first half,\na shot off the inside of their past and\nanother blatantly handled on the line.\nWith the ref still in the wrong half\nour calls for a penalty were ignored.\nBut justice came with a fantastic diving header - albeit by a Holloway\ndefender - which put us one up at\nhalf-time.\nAnd so the floodgates opened. The\nHolloway team was helpless in\ndefending wave after wave of our\nattacks. Like Moses parting the Red\nSea we pulled apart their defence\nwith our vision and movement.\nAdam finally scored after hitting\nthe post in his last three games and\nMorgan shrugged off defenders to\nslot in the third. The blitzkrieg on the\nHolloway box led to a swivelled shot\nby Pistol Pete - our number four. Nak\nput on a star performance, taking no\nprisoners and scoring brilliantly\ntwice from twenty yards. All this\nwithout Dazzler anywhere to be\nseen...\nWe worked together like a well\noiled unit (oo er) to demolish the\nleague leader's pride and self-esteem. With a game in hand and\nthree points between us and the top\nthe championship looks within our\ngrasp.\nInevitably they scored the obligatory goal from a corner but who\ncares? Roll on the last thirty-two in\nBUSA and the grudge match against\nthe seconds.\nIC IVs 6 - 1 Royal Holloway\n.and on.\nThe fourths are now officially top of\nthe league. With all the other\nImperial football teams struggling\nwe are surely the best football team\nin Imperial. This will be confirmed\nwhen we win BUSA(!), and sooner\nstill beat the IC seconds in a challenge match in few weeks time.\nChris scored in the first minute of\nthe match and we never looked back.\nThe graceful Morgan danced\nthrough to score, and the rotund\nDarren slotted another home with\nour defence hardly troubled. Surely\nwe will walk this league as\nChampions [if our enormous egos\ndon't get in the way - Sports Eds].\nICI Vs30 QM WC RESULTS\nFOOTBALL IC lis 2 - 1 King's IC lis 1-2 St Mary's IC IVs 6 - 1 Royal Holloway Vs\nIC IVs 3 - 0 QMWC IVs\nSKIING\nTeam Combined Slalom : 1 st\nTeam Dual Slalom : 2nd RUGBY\nC&G731 Royal Free Hospital\nSt Mary's259 UC Hospital\nLADIES HOCKEY IC Ist XI 3 - 0 Queen Mary\n\n"

    "content": "FANTASY SABBATICAL LEAGUE FELIX FRIDAY 31ST IANUARY\nFelix brings you an unrivalled opportunity to share the success of\nnext year's sabbaticals with\nFelixes Fantasy Sabbatical\nLeague\u2122.\nNow you too can join in the cut and\nthrust of the sabbatical race by playing\nFelix's Fantasy Sabbatical\nLeague\u2122.\nRead on, and you could be a winner!\nNo catch, no purchase necessary.\nFirst Prize:\nTwo return tickets to Paris and a bottle of Champagne\nLast chance to enter:\nclosing date 5.00pm February 3rd The aim of the game\nThe object of Felix Fantasy Sabbatical League is to predict the outcome of\nthe 1997 ICU Sabbatical Elections. Using your skill and judgement, you must\nchoose which four people you think will be elected to each of the four sabbatical positions, and which four will be runners-up (ie lose and come second).\nFirst and second place positions arc simply determined by who wins most\nvotes in the eventual elections. To win, you will have to guess not only who\nwill be elected, but also who is likely to stand for election.\nIncluded opposite is a list of possible 'players.' These are people who currently hold positions on Council (the governing body of the Union) plus a few\nwildcard s. They are the people closely involved with the Union whom we feel\nare most likely to stand for one of the four sabbatical positions. We have\nplaced them in divisions, according to the seniority of their position within the\nUnion, and assigned a points value to the players in each division. THE POSITION OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE LEAGUE REFLECTS ONLY\nTHEIR CURRENT STATUS WITHIN THE UNION: IT DOES NOT REPRESENT HIS/HER LIKELIHOOD OF STANDING OR BEING ELECTED.\nThere are two other 'players'; you should enter 'New Election' as asce on d choice for a position if you think that only one candidate will stand for that\npost, or if you think people would rather vote for a new election than any of\nthe candidates. If you think someone other than those included on our list will\nstand for a particular post, then include the 'None of the above' player in the\nrelevant place on your team. You do not have to state who you think 'None of\nthe above' will be. If 'New election' or 'None of the above' finishes in the\nplace you have guessed, you score the same points as if you had guessed an\nactual individual's result.\nRemember, you are strictly limited in the number of points you can spend\non players, and so may not be able to field your first choice team... This is\nwhere the element of chance comes in. Good luck!\nSabbaticals? What SabbaticalsP\nFor those not in the know, each year Imperial College Union holds a cam-pus-wide ballot to elect new sabbatical officers.\nThere are four sabbaticals elected by campus-wide ballot at ICU:\nPresident, Deputy President (Finance & Services), Deputy President\n(Clubs & Societies) and Felix Editor. They hold their position for year\nwhile taking a break (a sabbatical) from their studies. During this time, each\nis ultimately responsible for running the services and performing the duties\nunder their remit. These people are your representatives in many different\nareas, whether attending college committees on academic affairs or being\nresponsible for the finances of the Union and the many clubs and societies\nwhich you may belong to.\nFor example, the Deputy President (Clubs and Societies) in charge of the\nrunning of the many clubs and societies of the Union as well as health and\nsafety and representing the Union (and you) on college committees, among\nother duties. Thus, even if you arc the Caving Club chairman implementing H&S policy or just an ordinary member of the International Tamil\nSociety, the DP (C&S) looks after your interests.\nThis year's sabbatical elections will take place in early March. However,\nthe papers for nominations go up on February 3\"' for two College weeks.\nAny full member of Imperial College Union may stand for any of the positions listed above. To be able to run for election, however, each nominee\nmust have a proposer and twenty second ers, all of whom must also be full\nmembers of the Union. After the papers come down on February 14'\\ campaigning proper can start, and the 1996-97 sabbatical race can begin.\nIf you have any queries about the elections or wish to find out more about\nany of the posts, contact the President, Eric Allsop, via the Union Office,\nor speak to the present en cum bents.
