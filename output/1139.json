Everlast. He says 'I'm a little older and the music is more mature', and that he has moved on from 'drinking beers and slam dancing'. But contrary to his word, the album starts with a hilarious 80s school-key-board style track - The White Boy is Back.\nIt all gets a lot more serious after that,\nas Everlast sees this as his chance to right all the wrong she sees in the world\ntoday, including the material obsessed society of the US.\nHe's moved a lot of acoustic guitar\nand actual singing into this album rather\nthan the beats and the loudmouth rant\nstyle House of Pain were so famous for.\nSaying that, heavy beats arc still occasionally in evidence it's just that they're\nnow tempered by more rocky elements. It also seems that Everlast has got a lot more philosophical in his old age. With lyrics such as 'I see everybody rocking the same old style, and everyone\nsporting the same pro-file' it appears as\nif Everlast is more than a little angry with\nthe sterile-corporate spin that is being currently put out by rap artists. While a lot\nof people would agree with this point of view, isn't his pseudo-rap-rock style the ultimate in making rap more palatable for\nthe guitar obsessed world of the US\nmainstream?\nThis new sounds wings between Busta Rhyme's style machine gun lyrics,\nand Soundgarden rock earnestness. Some of his new-found solo success has\ngone to Everlast's head with a good example being on the track Today- 'the\nworld is mine today watch mc shine',\nand this theme is repeated throughout.\nThe rap mainstream will doubtless\nlabel this album as a pure unadulterated\nsell out, but I can see this album being very successful in the 'crossover' market\nas Puff Daddy/Jimmy Paige have previously demonstrated. The lyrics arc were this album comes into its own and ultimately pulled me back into liking the sounds emanating from my stereo. Everlast really does have\nthe touch when it comes to writing lyrics\nthat make you stand up and listen. It's a refreshing change indeed to hear a rapper talking about real world issues rather\nthan 'Ho's', guns and gangs.\nIf you are into hard rap and beats this\nisn't the album for you if, however,\nyou are prepared to be a bit more open-minded and listen to some interesting\nlyrics you could do a lot worse than this.\nGl Joel\nring and a couple of' I do's' does to\nyou, cancel my subscription to Dateline.\nLiz Phair tre a 'ts Whitechocolatcspaceegg as her confessional and although I like the S uz zanne Vegasoundalike, wrap-around stream-of-con-s cio us ness vocals, the lyrical tone is one of aw hinging West Coaster, convinced of her importance and with an unhealthy\nfondness for her own naval. Phair's musical sensibilities are still very much pop, and the melodies on the album, though rather Tune-a Day for Guitar, ate pleasant\nenough if a little same y with the odd diversion into other genres( Perfect\nWorld, Baby Got Going, Headache) failing to compensate. If you don't like it,\ngive it to your girlfriend. I might be missing something that those of you with two\nX chromosomes would find to love about\nthis album, but to my ears \"whl te chocolate space egg\" is just that: anaemic, sugary and with nothing substantial inside.\nra\nMatt\nWhitechocolatespaceegg\nLiz Phair -1 wonder what she\nwants for Easter?\nL iz Phair talks about platonic relationships, Liz Phair talks about\ncasual lust, Liz Phair talks about\nmarriage, Liz Phair talks about childcare.\nThe smarter amongst you might have\nbegun lose e the pattern.

Surprise, sur-p rise, Phair just got hitched and now she wants to tell us all about it. Mistaking poetic pretentiousness for lyrical pro-fund it y, she takes us on a touchy-feel y trip through the worlds of wedded bliss\nand maternal ecstasy, passing through mother-child angst (Only Son), marital\nstrife (Go On Ahead), the beauty of perm an en ce( Love Is Nothing) and post\nknot-tying male-female relationships( fantasize) cn route.

    "content": "10 8 March 1999\nMalaysian Focus\nBlack Eye Inquiry Revealed Shocking Ordeal of Former DPM\nT wo trials of different natures but of\nequal importance are in session right now in Kuala Lumpur. One has been proceeding since last No vem ber while the other only began a fortnight ago. The former is a normal High Court trial with the sole purpose of determining one person's guilt or innocence, while the latter Is a Royal Commission of Inquiry, not unlike the MacPherson Commission that investigated the Stephen fawr en ce's murder case. However, the contrast basically\nends there. The same man, Mr Anwar Ibrahim, inevitably, is the focus of both cases. In an almost unprecedented phenomenal manner, unmatched by\nanyone in the short history of the co un try, one man has caused severe damage to the government's credibility in\nthe eyes of the general public. His\n' power corruption trial', dubbed as\nMalaysia' s Trial of the Century, has resulted in the people questioning the establishment over fundamental issues\nsuch as justice and human rights. In\naddition to that, worries have been raised over the professionalism of the police and independence of the judicial\nsystem. The Royal commission or Black Lye\nInquiry was formed in\nthe wake of the find-concluded Anwar Ibrahim was beaten while in their cus-today, following his arrest in September\nlast year. The purpose of the commission is to name the individuals that\nassaulted the former deputy PM. Early\nstatements by some police officers dur-ing the investigation suggested that\nthe ex-police chief, Rahlm Noor, who resigned in January, might have been directly involved as one of the assailants. However, it was the startling and shocking account of the vict im himself that must have astounded many Malaysians: for example, the manner in which hundreds of police\nspecial force unit members stormed into his house to arrest him, as though he was an armed and dangerous c rim NikB Hafiz Inal. Then, at\nthe police headquarters later\non, while blindfolded and handcuffed, Anwar claimed that he was bru-leaving him bloodied, bruised and with the famous left black eye which has caused strong public uproar. His ordeal didn'tend there, as he recalled that he was then transferred to a secret hideout, stripped\nnaked, dumped in a dungeon and for\nfour days denied medical care. A med ical doctor who eventually examined Anwar confirmed in front of the members of the commission that the injuries\nwere the result of him being beaten, refuting suggestions by some quarters\nthat they were self-inflicted. After learning of these event show can the ordinary Malaysian not share Anwar Ibrahim's fears when he pondered, \"If\nI'm given this kind of treatment, what about the other people in this country?\"\nAt the time this column was writ-ten, the latest findings from the royal\ncommission were that the former Inspector General of Police, Rahim Noor, through his attorney, has finally\nadmitted to assaulting Anwar after\napparently being verbally provoked by\nthe ex-DPM and\" losing his cool\". Meanwhile, with the upcoming state elections in the eastern Malaysian\nstate of Sabah on12 and13 March, the\nruling coalition party, National front is\nencountering its first litmus test ahead of the general election, which has to\nbe held by early 2000. Even though the Dr Mahathir-led party has, for the time being, managed to stabilise the\npolitical scene and turn around the economy towards recovery, it still faces\nan uphill battle to retain power in\nSabah. All eyes are definitely on this\npolitically volatile state during the next\nweek, to observe if the present gove rn ment can be returned to power in\nview of the strong emergence of two opposition parties, the United Sabah\nParty (PBS) and the Federation of Sabah People's Front Party (Bersekutu).\nThought for the Day\nFridges, Flats and Freaks\nB lock vote. Wait, no. Chinese granite.\nNo, that's wrong. My apologies. It\nseems I 've forgotten how to write\nthis column. Women. Yes, I think it'sco ming back to me. Misery. Despair. By Jove.\nGot it.\nHello to one and all. I'm sure you won't be wondering why I haven't graced\nthese pages for a while. Why the miraculous return? Study this question further, and ask, why did I write the article at the beginning of term? AmI really that good? No. Shucks. It was because our editor, Ed\n\"Nicholson\" Sexton (nice one, Gulix) has\nbegun to think along similar lines to the\nprevious editor, one Jeremy \"WinNuke\"\nThomson, in realising the following, very\nimportant premise: this column never,\never needs proofreading. [Smug noises]\nSeriously, though, you will have noticed\nthat a couple of last term's columnists\nhave bailed out of the old writing lark, at\nleast temporarily. It just goes to show that\nthis job is not as easy as you might think.\nIt's not all smoked salmon and champagne\nwith Mr Caldwell, you know. It's staying up\nuntil six in the morning doing yet another\nf rigging election special. (There's also quite\na bit of lugging fridges\nabout, for some reason.) So\nbefore you write in with\nyour gripes and moans, consider that the\ncat is only human.I would also like you to\nbear this in mind next time\nI write something crap. Or\nmake a spelling mistake.\nI was looking through\nold Felixes, and, boy, did I write some drivel some times. This time last year I wrote something about flat\nhunting. (I remember some-one in my department complementing me on the\npiece. Believe me,I was as\nsurprised as you are now. I wrote it in twenty minutes.\nIt was sham bol ic.)I was sitting in the computer room,\nthinking about this, and listening to two first-years discussing living plans for next\nyear, when I realised some thing that I didn't know when I wrote the\noriginal article. Not all first-years are going to get re-app places. Not all will get con-All Campbell\nNo smile, no fag, no phone; Just you and me veni ent( but very cold) flats\nin South Kensington.

Here's the point: don't be disc once r ted if your living\nplans culminate in long and expensive treks across\nLondon. Picking a cheap\nflat can mean getting a lounge, and getting single\nrooms. Best of all, you're\nno longer a student; you're\nan inhabitant of London.\nExposing yourself to a different cross-section of society is refreshing after being\nstuck in the room next to\nthe Resident Linstead Acid\nTechno Freak. Plus you can\nhave parties.\nWe had some sabbatical elections, didn't we? What do you mean, you don't know? I spent a good hour laying out those interviews so you lot\ncould be well-informed. Pah.

    "content": "2 News 8 March 1999\nInce Inflates Food Fees\nFood prices in the ICU catering outlets - Da Vinci's, dB's, the Wednesday and Friday barbecue and the Union Bar - look set to rise\nfrom today by about ten percent across the\nboard. This will mean that curries are now \u00a31.20, and a main meal will be around\n\u00a32.50. The policy was decided on by the\nUnion Trading Committee, and approved\nby Council on Tuesday.\nThe reasoning behind this move is\nthat the outlets are currently running at a massive loss - expected to be around twenty\nthousand pounds by summer. There arc\nseveral factors influencing this loss. Biology's move to the BMS (with its College-run\ncafe), and increased staffing costs due to\nBy Gareth Morgan\nthe opening of the baguette bar in dB's have had an effect. The final straw however\nwas an LU directive entitling part-time workers to holiday benefits, or in the case of ICU\nstaff, a six percent lump sum paid every 13\nweeks.\nAlthough every effort was made to\nreduce the losses, the price rises were the\n\"last resort\" according to a member of the\nTrading Committee, who went on to add,\n\"We really had no other option. Catering\nwas budgeted to break even this year, but\nit's making a huge loss.\" Subsidising the\ncatering from other Union funds, advocated by the DP (l&S) candidates at the hus-tings, is \"not a good idea.\"\nthe move has received a generally\nnegative reaction from students however.\nResponses ranged from \"fuck off\" to com plaints that the food was supposed to be\na service for students. One Union figure\nquestioned the marketing of the catering\noutlets though: if trade could be brought in\nfrom the College outlets then the problems\ncould be solved. Better advertising on campus could help to achieve this.\nOn a lighter note, Council approved a pay rise of five pence per hour for Union staff, bringing their wages to \u00a33.70 an hour.\nissue 1139\n8 March 1999\nEditor: Ed Sexton\nAssistant Editor & Films: David Roberts\nNews Editor: Andrew Ofori\nMusic Editors: Dennis Patrickson\n& Jason Ramanathan\nArts & Books Editor: Helena Co che me Games Editor: Gary Smith\nClub scene: Giles Morrison, Gur minder Mar wah a& Joel Lewis\nSports Editor: Gus Paul\nBike Thieves Arrested\nA man has been arrested\nafter attempting to steal a bicycle from College premises. Three other men were also\ndetained at the scene. It is believed that\nthe four may be one of the 'gangs' that\nhas been targeting Imperial College for\nbike theft in recent years. Although pleased with the men's capture, Chief\nSecurity Officer Ken Weir warned cyclists\nto be vigilant, and outlined some ways in\nwhich students and staff can help prevent\nthe crimes. la*\"*!' lk Jkd A if \u2022\nI he incident ^ Mj \u00a3 jK j^^C lW began when security \"~.\u00bb?^'5?^ft s* guards noticed three\nmen acting suspiciously outside Biochemistry at around\n2pm on Thursday 25\nFebruary. The men walked off campus towards Queen's Gate, and were challenged by security at\nthe junction of Queen's Gate and Imperial College Road. The men, who Photo: Rachel\nall spoke with a Liverpudlian accent,\nrefused to produce identity cards or say\nwhether they were members of the col-leg e. Security then requested police assis-t ance. While waiting for the police, a fourth man appeared from the campus with a mountain bike. One of the original\nthree shouted \"Run, the police are com ing!\" The man attempted to escape on the\nbike but was accosted by a security guard\nand a member of the Estates division.\nThe police arrested him on arrival. As the\nincident is still part of a police investigation,\ns mm information concerning the\nBy Ed Sexton men is restricted, but Ken\nWeir, Chief Security Officer,\nis hopeful that \"this is one of the groups\nthat have been targeting us\", reiterating his\nbelief that the majority of bike theft at the\ncollege is carried out by organised gangs.\nRecent news stories and letters sent\nto Felix have reopened the bike theft\ndebate. In response to last week's Felix,\nKen Weir made several points.

Emails can be\nsent to cso.security@ic.ac.uk. Although he could not guarantee he would respond to\nevery letter, he did say he was open to student opinion. In the mean time, if you suspect a theft is in progress, find an internal\nphone and dial 4444 (the college's emergency number).\nConnolly in Drag\nBy David Roberts\nPhoto: Steve The cream of Electrical Engineering strut their funky stuff\nFollowing up on the success of the Chem ical Engineering Revue on2 Ie bru ary( Felix 1135), the Electrical Engineering\nshow attracted an audience of around100 students and staff when the curtain\nwas raised on25Ic bru ary. The Revue, organised by the Department of Electrical Engineering Society, included a dozen or so acts covering\nthe broad spectrum of \"entertainment\" -from satirical swipes at senior staff to\nmusical numbers from Guilds President\nReuben Connolly (pictured above). Also\nincluded on the bill were acts from staff,\nincluding departmental legends BobS pen cc and Peter Cheung, who fortunately seemed equally happy to send themselves up.\nAmongst the other highlights of the show was Gary Smith's rendition of \"demonstrator training\", which included\nclasses on student confusion, avoiding the question and confab ul ation and struck true with members of all depart-ment s. Later in the first half, five intrepid\nstudents took to the stage to give a( thankfully mimed) rendition of the Spice\nGirls. Sadly, carefully choreographed dance routines seemed to have been for-gotten, in favour of random movements across the stage. However, nothing could\nprepare the audience for what was to fol-low: after a quick change Reuben returned to the stage to perform a re-worded version of Robbie Williams 'Mil-lenni um' this time entitled 'Engineering'.\nIn comparison to the painful quality of his\nbacking singers, he looked like the\nembodiment of Mr Williams himself.\nThe first show of its kind in the\ndepartment for several years, it was hailed as a triumph by coordinator Sanela\nHodzic.

Dress code\n= none.\nOne of London' s newest house nights this south of the river jaunt only\nbegan two weeks ago, and quite frankly\nit shows. Despite the promises of glitter\ncannons, balloon drops, and the most\nstylish night that the capital has seen in\na while, Shine just doesn't deliver. But it\nis not a complete disaster area either. It\nis merely a fledgling night trying to learn\nto fly in a city full of big players.\nThe first thing that you notice is the clientele in the club. Shine replaced the gay night Love Muscle, and there appears to be a bit of a hangover from this amusingly-named past incarnation. I certainly don't have anything against gay\nnights or indeed against there being a mixed crowd at Shine. Indeed, some of the best nights around are mixed, because you feel as if you can relax\nmore in the anything goes atmospheres.\nHowever, that's not what Shine is trying\nto do. It is trying to be a glam house night\nwhich appeals to, and I quote\" more experimental of the capital'sc lubbers.\" To\ndo this it must try and up the proportion\nof female punters who go along it was just too packed full of blok es. Now I know that I didn't help by not taking any\ngirlfriends along this time, but it's not all\nmy job, now is it?\nThe music also needs to get a seri-o us injection of melody and energy. The\ntempo may have been just about right\nbut the tracks played by the majority of\nthe DJs were just plain boring. I seriously\ncan't remember a single tune, and none of them even came close to giving me that usual rush that you get when you really enjoy a track. Despite the calibre of the talent on show, such as Roy the Roach and DJ Dimitri from Paris, the sets\nwere just mindless, amorphous blobs of\ndepressingly tedious music. And the crowd knew it too despite their attempts\nto look happy. You just sensed everyone\nwas going through the motions, wishing\nthey were somewhere else.\nBut maybe this wasn't the case, 'cos\nif you are going to go to any club in Lond on, then make it The fridge. This is a stunning venue. The main dancefloor Is\nhuge, as is the stage area at the back, so\nthere is plenty of space to go and show off your moves. Al the same time, if you feel more like hiding away your talents,\nor getting up to no good, then there are\nplenty of little out-of-thc way sections to\nexplore. It maybe confusing to get\naround this place when you are not thinking too clearly, but it's worth the expedition - every part of it is great. Just wish the night had been as good as the club.\nStill, not to worry - look out for my review\nof the legendary Escape from Samsara\n(Fridays at The Fridge) in the next issue\nof Clubs cc ne. As for Shine, don't just take my word for it - it isn't all that bad really. And it will\nget better as they manage to carve out\nan identity for themselves, just give them a little more time to live up to their name.\nShiny or Just Dull?\nRoobarb\nHave a Nymphtastic\nNight for Cheaper\nThanks to your lovely friends here at\nClubs cc ne, you can now get into the\nsplendid Nymph night (reviewed right\nhere twice!) at Mass, in Brixton, for\njust \u00a37. Their next jaunt is on March13 th and stars the huge Justin Robertson and the funky Farley Jackmaster Funk. To get\nyour special concession just take along a copy of Felix (and then throw it in the bin so as not to appear very sad indeed),\nor simply mention Felix magazine at the\ndoor and show your student card. What\ncould be easier? Well not very much, so\ngo and do it.\nRoobarb\nSingles\nK90\n'Species'\n(Boscaland)\nAnother thumping piece of sottish\ntechno to come out of the True love Label Collective camp, this track is an\ninteresting piece of vinyl to get your\nhands on. That's 'cos unlike many other\n12\" there is a great contrast between the two mixes that you get. The Original Mix is more conventional with a user-friendly\nmelody, and a couple of nice break-downs. But it's the Trash Compactor Remix which really does the business. It's a dark and funky piece, which manages to work well despite being quite a bare\ntrack.\nOut April 5th \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIncognito\n'Nights Over Egypt'\n(Talking Loud)\nA nice laid-back number from the\nIncognito people. Once you get past\nthe fact that they are singing one of the\nsilliest (but at the same time original) choruses ever to hit club land then this record\ncan really grow on you. A soulful, uplifting track that would sit' well in any garage/soft house set, this track, (and all\nthe mixes in the double vinyl pack) brims\nfull of slick production. Although( quite\nexpected ly) it's the Masters at Work Main Mix that is being plugged, try out the Maw Mix on the B side. It's less jazzy and cuts straight to the point. Also took out\nfor some useful bonus beats and a capel las for all you aspiring chilled-out DJs out\nthere.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHeaven's Children\n'Bam Bam'( TEC)\nA catchy tun c in all its guises on this\n12\".

    "content": "8 March 1999 Books 17\nHOT SEX by Tracey Cox A part from perhaps God: The Truth,\nit is difficult to think of a more alluring title than Hot Sex, HowTo\nDo It. So when I was asked to review this\nbook, written by Miss Tracey Cox, I was intrigued as to the angle that the author\nwould take on this fascinating subject,\nand hopeful that 1 might find some effective metaphysical imagery. OK, so really\nI thought I might learn something, and there was certainly a great deal of information on all facets of sexual relations (as\nBill Clinton would have it). Although there\nis a great deal on sex, how to do it, and why you should even bother in the first\nplace, all that I read was not particularly\nnew, or interesting.\nThe style is very friendly and informal,\nand you can see the author's skill as an agony aunt for a popular women's magazine has come in useful in her writing\ncareer. However this could also be her\ndownfall - this book is definitely not aimed at our age group. Hot Sex seems really to be a compendium of all her\n'greatest hits', which begins to get quite\nirritating by the end. I don't mean that in\na patronising way: Iam referring to the fact that a large proportion of the book is dedicated to subjects such as dealing\nwith divorce, what to do if you suspect\nyour 'partner' is having an affair, and a huge 3 0 % of the 350 pages is on the subject of contraception, STDs, impotence( male and female), and other 'Serious\nSexual Problems', like abortion and rape.\nI would like to stress that I don't think\nthese things are unimportant, and they\nare definitely not irrelevant, but it is quite\nobvious that this book is not meant to be\nall fun and games in the bedroom. In\nfact, in these more delicate areas the author manages to be very sensitive\nwhile remaining informative, although\nnothing beats a good counsellor.\nThe book is also quite clearly written\nfor women, and all 'hints' are written as\nif to a woman so that she could pass it\non to her (and you definitely get the feeling he' s unwilling) male partner. In\nmore than one instance while describing\nhow to give a woman excellent oral sex\n(just for example...), the instructions run\nalong the lines of, '...then get him to run\nhis tongue along the length of your...',\nand soon. However there is some useful sexual\ninformation, and the first word of the book is masturbation, so it can't be all\nbad, but unless you're planning to settle\ndown to some serious monogamy, I would strongly advise giving this a miss.\nJust settle down with the good-old-fashioned Kama Sutra, and try to work out\nwhich bit goes where on your own. Well...not on your own, obviously.\nWill\n\u00a37.99 from Corgi Books\nn his sixth published offering, Dou glas Coup land seems to have come into his own. Girlfriend in a Coma\nhas proved his most critically acclaimed\nwork, not for its use of brand humour or\nbecause it fits nicely into a current sociological trend {Generation X and Microserfs), but simply because it is a good piece of writing. Chronicling the\nlives of six friends from their last drug-filled days of high school to the uncertainty and regret of middle age, the book is a beautiful example of the modern allegory - the urban myth.\nThe first sentence, 'I'm Jared an dI'ma ghost.', and the first chapter title,\n'All Ideas are true', set the tone for the\nrest of the book. Narrated at first by the dead Jared and then by others, we sec the final carefree days of the characters\nin high school, full of promise and hubris.\nRichard loses his virginity on a ski slope\nwith his strangely distant girlfriend and within the hour she is in a coma where she stays for 6,719 days and83 pages.\nDuring this time Richard and the rest\nof the gang have the chance to lose any existing direction in their lives. After moving away to seemingly better things, they\nall gravitate back to their old street in Van' couv er, now as burned out, uncertain\nmiddle-aged adults.\nThe characters worry and obsessively self-analyse as they each attempt\nto reconcile their pasts, allowing Coupland to explore the theme of the book the search for truth. Whether or not sci-en ce students need to be convinced of the value of questioning instead of blindly accepting remains to be seen, but\nstill a reminder is not a bad thing. Chap ter titles play a very large role in developing the moral of the story, progressing\nfrom 'All ideas are true' to 'Reject every\nidea', 'Progress is over' and finally 'The\nEnd' with comments about contemporary society and consumerism. Following the reunion of the friends\nand the awakening of Karen (the girl-friend), Coup land moves on to his vision\nof the end of the world, allowing further\ndevelopment of the plot. It is not the\nmost chilling end of the world scenario\n(any nuclear physicists or epidemiologists care to comment?) but it does have\nan interesting twist.\nAll in all, a really interesting and multi-levelled read, to which this review\ndoesn't do justice, but not one that has\ncaused along term alteration in my per-spec ti ve, although it really has the potential. I 'll just have to read it again.\nRussell\n\u00a36.99 from Flamingo Publishing\n\n"

Frank Loesser' s quintessential Guys and Dolls, set in New York du ring the late 1940s, captures the glamour of show business and the excitement of the gangster genre. The story follows the parallel relationships of two couples; the delinquent crap shooting gambler Nathan Detroit (John Franks) and the brassy\nshowgirl Miss Adelaide( Julia Addison), the reformed sinner Sky Mast ers on( John Loft house) and the idealistic missionary Sarah Brown( Faye Austin) proof indeed that\nopposites attract. Overall, the standard of the singing chorus and leads\nalike - was extremely impressive; each memorable, catchy tune was delivered with skill and gusto, the dozen strong band conducted by Paul Jeane s providing the jazzy accompaniment. A sparkling and inspirational fairytale at heart, this classic musical is\nessentially about taking chances in\nlife. Under the guidance of director\nPhil Ftollman, the expressive acting was perfectly paced and balanced. The dynamic and light-hearted dance rou tines were interspersed with moments of genuine humour and touching romance. The attention to detail, from the\nkitschy and often risque kaleidoscopic costumes to the perfection of an embellished Brooklyn twang, demonstrated the dedication and enthusiasm of the company. Onstage, the chemistry between the characters was tangible it\nappeared that the Op Soc cast enjoyed performing just as much as the audience appreciated the show.

The film follows her\ndiscovery, rise and consequent exploitation. The film features well known songs by legendary actresses\nand singers such as Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe and Shirley Bassey,\nalongside those sung by Horrocks as\ntittle Voice.\nHorrocks' mimicry of the Monroe sound and style is extremely realistic\nand at times, a touch uncanny while\npouting her way through / Wanna Be\nLoved By You. However, when com pared to the real thing, her voice lacks\nthe depth and power of the others, but\nthe similarities mean that her songs do not sound too out of place. Tom Jones\nis the token male artist featured with It's Not Unusual, which although cheesy\nand classy in its own right, does sound inferior on a soundtrack of this calibre.\nThe purpose of a soundtrack is to\ncompliment the film, but due to the exclusion of the instrumental back-ground bits, which are the usual sound track fodder, this soundtrack also stands\nalone as a collection of some really good music. However, as with all films when music from the soundtrack is featured,\nit tends to be in snippets and/or pushed very much to the background1 hope that this film does the music justice. In\nconclusion, it's not your average student buy, more that of an older relative-but nevertheless very good indeed.

He describes himself as Bob Dylan with samplers or Elliot Smith prod u ced by the Beastie Boys. And indeed\nMona Lisa Overdrive is more akin to\nBeck than the bland offerings of the Wellers of this world. That isn't to say\nthere are no echoes of yesteryear; Sapphire and Dying Day have the poignant\ndelicacy of Nick Drake and All Change\nis Alex Chilton wil h tabla.\nLoss of the self and of other selves\nare common themes but the message is positive.

Lure ka Is not\nonly an acoustic guitarist's copy book and a lazy, dreamy, if-it-were-any-more-laid-back-it'd fall-over one at that - it's a collection of aural watercolours, a sound collage of Chicago, the West\nCoast, Cuba and the Caribbean that\ncouldn't hurry if it tried. Listening to Jim\nO 'Rourke's latest release is the musical\nequivalent of eating Cadbury' s Caramel, it's an aural representation of how Guinness should be poured, it's a Radox bath for the brain. Gloriously\nmelodious, crisp and assured finger-picked guitar, shimmering piano and more different kinds of percussion and brass than you can shake a stick at.\nCrosby, Stills and Nash fans will recognise the light, airy, beautifully harm on is ed vocals that sparingly grace the album, at a hundred yards and smile\nwith the pleasure of re acquainting one self with an old friend. Fans of laid back\nLatin rhythms will nod in approval at the subtle percussion and brass on Please\nPatronise Our Sponsors and the l'm so-relaxed-l could-just-shit horns on Movie\nOn The Way Down and Something Big,\nwhilst the Jamaicans in the audience will break into a broad grin on hearing\nthe sax/steel drum combination that\nlends originality to Through The Night\nSlowly.

There is a petition going around stating\n\"We the undersigned believe that the London Transport student discount card\nis an important scheme to help alleviate\nstudent hardship, but that it should not\ndiscriminate against mature students and should be available to all students\nof all ages.\" If you agree with the above statement, could you please sign the petition, t ach year rep should have\none, if not get them to chase up their\ndepartmental reps, or sign the one on the front desk of the Union. College Catering is often criticised\nfor cost, but for such an international\nCollege as Imperial it is also disc rim in a tory. Currently Muslims can not eat\nmost of the meal dishes provided, as\nthe meat is not hall al food( it has to be killed in a certain\nway.) As a consequence they have to\neat fish sticks if they\nuse College catering\nand want a meat dish. II is understandable that the catering department can not cater for everyone due to cost\nand demand for products, but with such a large Muslim community in the\nCollege, who are prepared to pay a little more for food they can cat, it is not\nDavid Hellard, ICU President\nunreasonable that\none dish a day is Hallal.\nThis week in\nIe lix, I'm sure there\nis going to be an article about price\nincreases in the Union. Currently we are heading for a massive loss on the outlet and even with\nthe increase will be losing substantial money. Although money isn't every-thing, it is money that goes towards your clubs and soci-e ties. It is perhaps worrying that even with this large price increase, we are still\nfar cheaper than any of our College competitors. College catering this year\nhas budgeted enough to buy the equivalent of nine minibuses or 1000 return\ntrips to Harlington (I think that would cover training) in profit. It comes down to ethics. Are our outlets here to make money out of our students or to offer\nthem a genuine service? Compare any-thing the College can put out for \u00a31.20\nto one of our curries and I think it's quite clear which policy the Union and the College arc employing. It's time Ihe\nCollege realised why they are here; the students. ( Emergency services please\nbe on standby, I think some of the College have just had heart attacks.)\nAs ever any thoughts should be emailed to president@ic.ac.uk.\nFifty Years On\nA Gentleman's Newspaper?\nDespite only producing nine issues\nbetween December1949 and the end of the 49/50 academic year, by the time .\nsummer approached Mr LM Hughes had managed to carve a definite character for Felix, and turn it into an in st it u tion.\nFelix in those early years was more of a gentleman's club than a newspaper a literary outlet for ex-public school friends who more commonly met through the drinking clubs. That Felix\nwas a private club, open to contribution\nbut wary of new members, is obvious from a flick through of those early issues.\nThe 'Felix Board' was an internally elected\nteam of writers and sub-editors, electing\nthe following year's editor at the end of the summer term.\nFelix's traditional independence and occasional opposition to Imperial College Union also began in the first year.\nThe fourth issue saw an irate Paul Cumming, then Union President, writing a letter of complaint concerning the previous\nweek's editorial concerning Rag fines.\nThe basic argument was that the Union had agreed to pay fines incurred by students breaking the law during the November5 th Rag activities, but then had apparently changed its mind, feeling\nthat \"for the Union to pay the fines would appear as a condo nation of the offence,\nwould act as an incentive to students to\nbreak the law in future.\" Mr Hughes suggested that a general meeting be called\nto debate the issue.\nTwo columns appeared in the seco nd issue. 'Profile' was intended to focus\non an individual or institution connected to the college, or otherwise of interest to\n7. \"i^ \u20227 .\n/W j* \u00bbt f. ti:,,h3> \u00abr li \u00bbj, \u2022\u00ab till \u2022*;\u00ab< tic th Tn fY'( A* readers. The first profile, un surprisingly, looked at the history of the Union Bar.\nApparently the first College Bar in the\ncountry, the first barman was Jim Peacock, although he denies this in a letter published later that -year, claiming the priv-el edge to belong to a mysterious woman., called Auntie. Appar- f^ mr\nent ly when the;\nUnion Building was built, the bar area\nwas intended as a secretary's office. Ihe\nfirst Union Secretary, aMr Houghton, demanded that it be turned into a bar, and the Union Committee eventually agreed.\nOther profiles of the first year included\nthe Rector, Sir Roderic Hill; Paul Cumming, the Union President; some local\nshopkeeper who was blonde, 6 foot tall,\nand apparently rather good looking; and the Imperial College Women's Assocation, who at the time had just over fifty\nmembers. The column continued very\nsuccessfully for Felix's first five years,\nbefore becoming somewhat more sporadic in appearance. The second column on its first\nappearance also dealt with\nbeer but, unlike Profile,\nalcohol was to be Ihe\nsubject matter for all\nof its issues. 'The\nDrinking Man's Guide to London' was exactly what you would expect; a pub was reviewed every\nweek where a young man may mop his fevered\nbrow and rest his tired feet,\nrelaxing over a pint of ale. And how much did it cost? Well, the first pub included was The Windsor Castle' (off\nKensington Church Street), where one could purchase a pint of Cherringtons I PA\nfor one eigth of a pence or, for those who want to go a bit more upmarket, the\nmild and bitter for one quarter of a pence. The rest of Ie lix was made up of sports and club reports, occasional news\narticles, and literary writing, mostly witty\npoetry. The editorials always made it\nquite clear that Felix would not answer to\nanyone and would voice its opinion loudly. The insular nature of the Felix\nEditorial team made it easy to maintain\neditorial control and political direction,\nsomething that the advent of Union subsidies and ICU Club regulations were to\nerode. At the same time it was un mistaking ly, unashamedly and appa ling iy an\nextension of the'21','22', 'Chaps' and 'Links' Drinking Clubs into journalism.\nStill, good things come from small begin-ning s... From Beer to Broadsheet\nWe have had some feedback from the\nprevious 'Fifty Years On' column, including input on the origin of the name Felix.\nAllow me to quote extracts of a letter I recently received from Anthony dc Reuck, a Physics student from 1947-51,\nwho was an editor of Phoenix and writer\nfor Felix.\n\"The familiar name used by the intimates in the Links Club of the Founding Father of Felix, that is to say Ted Hughes,\nwas 'Felix'. Felix Hughes, debonair, with\na dry wit and a satirical cast of mind, was a Guilds man and a Mechanical Engineer.\nHe would not have applied his own name to the College Newspaper he\nfounded in 1949, but FC Ewels ( whom Ido not recall) urged its adoption as a memorial to its Founder and as an as so nant gen u flex ion to its ancient cousin\nPhoenix.\" (full letter on letters page 6).\n\n"

    "content": "6 Letters 8 March 1999\nCamborne Coverage\nDear Felix,\nIam writing to comment on the space\nallocation in Felix. On the20 th February,\nthe Royal School of Mines played Cam borne (note the spelling). One would expect this event to be well covered, since it is a major sporting event. In fact,\nI was under the illusion that this was the case, with the new Felix Editor, Dave\nRoberts covering the matches for us.\nImagine the surprise in the RS M then, when expecting a decent spread, there\nwas a brief report on the front page. On turning to the sports pages at the back,\nexpecting further coverage I was shocked to see that Fellwalklng had a whole half page. I would have thought that the remarkable achievement of completing a whitewash for the first time ever over C SM would merit a proper report, not a paragraph for each of the sports. I did not bother writing a rugby\nreport, we won for the third consecutive\nyear by the way, since one presumes that\nthe presence of a Felix reporter on the touch line negates such things. It was great to have so many supporters present (perhaps the DP(C&S) missed the bus) and I hope you enjoyed yourselves.\nYours truly,\nMatthew Cockayne\nRSMRFC Captain\nI am very sorry you feel this way -1 had\nhoped that a front page mention would\nplease the ACC and other sports clubs, as\nI suspect many of you consider me to be\nbias against your activities. Still, I'm sure\nDave will cover It fully when you win\nnext year. - Ed\nWelfare Out of Touch\nDear Felix Editor,\nI would like to complain about the ICU\nWelfare Newsletter in last week's Issue of Felix which focuses on the use of ecstasy\nand cannabis. It seems that instead of impartially providing the facts needed for people to make informed lifestyle\nchoices, this article has used the usual\nscare mongering techniques tosca te people away from drugs. I consider this\nirresponsible and unnecessary.\nFirstly I question the statistic of1 in\n12 having tried ecstasy in the UK, is this\nbased on the entire population( in clu d ing, say, the elderly), or perhaps more realistically on a 'young' age range of maybe 15-25 year olds?\nAnd secondly, why is cannabis described as being relatively harmless\ncompared only to heroin? There is a lot\nof scientific research which shows that\ncannabis is also relatively harmless com pared to the more socially acceptable\ndrugs alcohol and tobacco, and that's in\nterms of its addictive properties, adverse\npsychological and physiological effects,\nand also general social problems( e.g. violence).\nThe apparently harmful effects of cannabis are listed as though they are\nfacts, although the only reliable evidence\ncurrently available suggests that cannabis\nmay only slightly impair certain cognitive\nfunctions after long term use, and may also slightly increase the incidence of\nmouth cancer. These adverse effects\nseem small to those accepted to be\ncaused by alcohol use, and certainly for\ntobacco use.\nAnd so what if 2 out of 5 people who have used cannabis in the last year will\nhave also tried another type of illegal\ndrug? This is hardly surprising considering that anybody who wishes to use cannabis is forced to come into contact\nwith harder substances via their dealers.\nThis seems to be the only gateway effect\nof soft drugs leading to harder drugs, and this effect would be eliminated if\ncannabis was de criminal is ed. The respect\nfor the illegal status of harder drugs\nwould also be restored if de criminal is a tion of cannabis occurred.\nI'm not saying cannabis is wonderful and everyone should smoke it, its not a drug that suits everyone and like all recreational activities (e.g. drinking or gam bling) its use requires a certain amount of self-discipline and sensibility.\nIt's about time drug issues were treated realistically, and drug users given\na little more respect and credibility. After\nall there is a difference between responsible drug use, and drug abuse believe\nit or not.\nUndergraduate Chemist\nI would like to say that I agree (almost)\nentirely with this letter. I didn't say anything last week about the Welfare\nNewsletter, as I felt It was wrong to com-ment, but since someone else has\nbrought it up... - Ed\nGnat Chum Comes Out\nDear crossword doers\nI feel obliged to hold up my hand and admit that I have not been thorough enough when checking my crosswords\nfor spelling and content. Please believe\nme when I say that there is noone more diss appointed that I when a mistake is\nprinted on a Monday morning. At the moment Iam the sole contributor of crosswords to Felix. I try to get a cross-word out every week but this will\nbecome increasingly difficult as the exam\nseason approaches. Anyone who thinks\nthey could compose a puzzle( it's not\nthat hard) or would just like to help out\nplease walk into the Felix office any time\nor e mail.\nHowever, I make no apology for\nmaking clues ridiculously obscure from time to time.\nYours\nNice thin and amusing( aka Gnat Chum) Gnat Chum would also like to apologise\nfor not producing a crossword this week,\nwouldn't he? - Ed\nThe Origins of Felix\nDear Ed Sexton\nMay I reminisce?\nThe familiar name used by the intimates in the Links Club of the Founding Father of Felix, that is to say Ted( EH)\nHughes, was \"Felix\" - where that came from no one knew, from his schooldays\nperhaps. Felix Hughes, debonair, with a dry wit and a satirical cast of mind, was a Guildsman and a Mechanical Engineer.\nHe would not have applied his own name to the College Newspaper he founded in 1949, but FC Ewels ( whom Ido not recall) urged its adoption as a memorial to its founder and as an as so nant gen u flex ion to its ancient cousin\nPhoenix.\nFelix and Phoenix were rivals only for\nthe services of the college literati.\nPhoenix appeared once a term; it was and still is the IC literary magazine, an outlet for essayists, poets, critics and artists. Felix was and still is a weekly newspaper of record with topical news and views about events, societies and clubs.

In fact that\nseemed to be all we were doing and when Ricki \"Jack Duckworth\" Gibson finally knocked the ball into their half,\nAlden \"Jorrel\" Banks pounced on it and perfectly chipped the keeper. My Dad would' ve been proud. After such a onslaught we did well\nto go in at halftime one-nil up, but knew that the tables would turn in the second half.\nfourth team policy of \"everyone gets\na half\" saw the removal of Richard \"Lippy\"\nTaylor and Peyrouz \"Impatient\" Modarres\nat halftime, in exchange for Simon \"60p\" Newton and Chris \" Debby Harry\"\nTzinieris.\nAt the start of the2 nd half, David \"\nPaddy\" Wishart had the fire in his belly\nand was fundamental in turning things\naround. The second goal came when the captain Elliot \"Great Party\" Newton read a ball well and calmly intercepted it.\nTurning a player with ease (can you tell\nI write these?) he laid off an inch perfect\npass to Chris. Good control and a \"Ronaldo-like\" turn allowed Chris to back-heel to Aidan who again finished superbly. 4 goals in 2 games for the prospective captain next season, from then on the game was ours with the back\nfour playing solidly. A free kick quickly\ntaken by them caught us off guard and they snatched one back, but Chris retaliated from a40 yard free kick which screamed past the keeper.

However,\nthe match almost\ndidn't take place due to the late\narrival of the Maths team, which resulted in a delay\nof over 30 minutes.\nWhen the match finally got underway, both teams started off slowly and took a while to get into\nthe game. Physics\nopened the scoring\nmidway through the first half with a well-worked move which was coolly finished off by\n\" Man of the Match\" Jimmy, who made it 2-0 shortly\nbefore halftime with another well-taken goal.\nThe second half followed pretty\nmuch the same path as the first,\nwith Physics dominating for long periods. Physics\nnotched up a third\ngoal early in the second half, scored by their captain\nShubeur. Both teams then had goals dis-allowed by the referee, (me!) who had a good game overall. By this stage, Maths\nwere getting rather frustrated and this\nfrustration was confounded when \"the\nMichael Owen of Physics,\" Jimmy netted\nhis hat-trick to make it 4-0. Maths finally\nmanaged to get the ball past GreekCypriot Marios, who had an outstanding\ngame in goal, when creative midfielder\nWing converted a chance set up by ICU\nfirst team member, Warren. Shubeur\nthen added a fifth for Physics, which was followed by two late consolation goals by\nthe captain of the Maths team, Dino.\nAt the final whistle, with most players exhausted, Maths players un sport ingly didn't shake the hands of the Physicists!

The setting is familiar\nenough \u2022 a two horse town interrupting featureless prairie and reeking of the desolation which permeates the genre. However, the traditional male\nheroes whose turbulent displaced lives\ngenerally provide the subject of such\nfilms are relegated to the background. Instead, taking centre stage are some of the western's most underdeveloped characters. The women who work as\nprostitutes in the saloons and brothels\nare released from their usual roles of cowering in the corner while a taciturn\nwanderer dispatches aba rful of drunken cowpokes to Boot Hill, and are allowed to tell their own story.\nAn eclectic cast plays a group of women who have the dubious privilege\nof working for Brenda frick er's madam. No matter how tough life in the brothel\ngets, we are reminded that a rootless\nexistence in the outside world would be more difficult for each of them. Kelly\nMcGillis (of Top Gun fame) turns in an assured performance as the stoical Nettie, working to support her son and alcoholic husband. Her circumspect attitude,\nWesterns. The last bastion of sexist misogyny (not counting RSM).\nand that of Mott ram,an older woman who fears that her working life may soon be over, contrast with those of the younger girls. The hardship which has driven Irish immigrant (Gallagher) and Germ an dancer (Becker) into prostitution\nlurks behind the warmth of their fragile\nfriendship, while the youngest, Jakub,\nentertains ambitious hopes of employ-ment in a city bordello.\nBritish director Jon Sanders has a background in documentary making, and, from the graphic depiction of the\nwomen's work down to their white pow der make up, he seems to have spared\nno effort in achieving the authentic appearance of Painted Angels. The relationships between the women are well\nconceived and neatly presented, but there is not much development of each character as the film progresses. This\nunusual portrayal of a brutal way of life\nis admirable, but the melancholic monotone of the film makes for fairly un involving viewing, Q Simon\nWin tickets and prizes galore with the\nKENSINGTON\nIt's Spring cleaning week here in the Felix film department, so there'sa plethora of tickets and merchandise on offer.

A terrible\nline out throw from our hooker Dave\nPearce put them to within scoring range.\nBut Imperial was having none of it and held fast. The break came with Brunei\nconceding a penalty for dirty play In the ruc k, and Dave Hog g booting the ball\ndeep into their half.\nfrom then, Imperial started to really\nput pressure on Brunei. Ou trucking them in the forwards and out playing\nthem in the backs, they really didn't see much ball. It wasn't long before Dave o Gol cut through the defence to score the\nfirst points for IC.\nIC thought that Brunei, having con ceded a score, would come back with all\ncannons firing. But they just didn't seem to compare at all with our fast paced game, and it was only a few minutes\nlater when Matt \"I'm too fat\" Cockayne took the ball on himself and flopped over the line to score a second try.\nImperial, really beginning to enjoy\nthe game, started to let loose and spent\nthe remainder of the first half camped near their line. More tries were scored\nby winger Andy Mayes and the scrum\nhalf Gabriel Oded iran. However, all was not well. Brunei,\nrealising that the game was now in their\nreach, started to play dirty and took every\nopportunity to stamp on our boys.\nInjuries started to occur and early in the second half saw Kaizen going off having\nbeen knee'd in the head and generally\nstamped all over. In the face of this,\nImperial momentarily wavered, allowing\nthem to push over for their first points.\nBut IC was still out playing them and Charlie \" wind me up and I start to go\" C un nel paced it down the touch line to\nput Ic further in the lead.\nBrunei had by now given up any hope of winning and were concentrating\ntheir efforts on hurting our people. They\neven decided to be sportsmanlike and brought on half of their second team to\ntry and force things their way.\nThere's only one thing left to say; we thrashed ' em! FOOTBALL\n2nds 'batter' SS/s;3 rds win too\nICII...\nSS/S.. In the New Year IC II have been having\na nightmare. We've won only 2 out of6 league games and been knocked out of the cup in the semi-final. However,\nafter Wednesday's result against SS/S1st team, things are suddenly to look a whole lot better.\nThis result sounds like a battering\nand a battering is what it was. Don't get\nme wrong, SS/S are a good side but this\nday belonged to IC. The first goal came soon, after the start of the game from a beautiful move started by Peter Camp bell, continued by A mah and finished by\nDave, from the most unlikely source -Inaki the super keeper. A long goal kick\n(aided by the wind) bounced just inside\ntheir box and proceeded to dip over\ntheir bewildered keepers head20. The third and fourth goals came soon after from A mah and Peter Campbell. IC battled into the wind in the seco nd half and shocked SS/S by scoring a5 th supplied again by Mr. Campbell, super defender. The sixth came soon after supplied by Dan Waight. I would again like to stress that SS/S are a good team and are third in the league but we were just outstanding on the day. It is\nas simple as that.\nUCL I IC III- .2\nFaced with the worrying danger of rel-eg ation, it was a resolute third team who turned up at Shenley, determined lo defeat a strong UCL team, and gain\n3 valuable points. Playing against a gale\nin the first half, IC defended like lions,\nRicky, in goal, still had to produce a string of outstanding saves to leave it at\n0-0 at half time. Having weathered the\nstorm (literally), IC mistakenly thought\nthe grave was there for the taking, and started the second half slickly. UCf are\na decent, and having seen a few chances denied by the still excellent\nRicky, eventually managed to score.\nThis set back proved a catalyst to IC,\nwho finally started to take control. However, with just 10 minutes to go, it was still 1-0 to UCf. Then, though, the ball\nbroke to Magic on the right, whose sweet first time cross was met by Ole. The 'keeper saved well he was there to\nbury the rebound. UCL again raised\nthe pressure, but this gave Malcolm the\nchance to lead a devastating counter\nattack. Having carried the ball for 60\nyards, his cross fell eventually Ole, who finished coolly. Cue ecstasy - only\nslightly dampened by the UCL bus sod-ding off without us.\nSCOREBOARD\nFOOTBALL\nWednesday3 rd March ULU League\nICII 6-1 SS/S Id III 2-1 UCL III\nLSE 5 - 0 IC Ladies\nUCL IV 1-3 IC IV\nSaturday 27th February\nRHULIV 2 - 5 IC IV\nCiv.

The first half began without\nthe legendary presence of Bigger Titties\nand Pink Gash. However, all was not\nlost. The passing was exceptional (occasionally), with the ball rarely returning to\nthe IC half. Once fast break Blue Underpants rounded two plays before setting\nup Jumbo B wana who took 3 attempts\nto put the ball past the keeper.\nThe second half started nervously,\nseeing Holloway put pressure on IC'sD for 5 minutes, not helped by Ic's inability to get the ball out safely.\nBut the defence came good, not\nallowing Holloway to convert any of this\npressure. A demon run by 11 plus saw the ball reach Bigger Titties stick less\nthan a foot from the goal. The third goal\nwas a tribute to Pink Gash' s speed, aggression and dedication (!). Feeling\nsorry for the opposition Mr.T gave the\nball to their CF and let the game rest at\n3 - 1 .\nDisco Squad..\nUCLMS II\nYet another cliff-hanger in the saga of the\ndisco boys. We ground out this result\nwith blood, sweat, tears and Rezoola's Pants. Grrrr...\nThe match started with a bit of fire,\nwith play flowing both ways, although not at the same time, obviously. I'm finding It hard to admit, but the medics cum did appear to have the upper hand to\nstart with. Ten minutes into the match,\nCasanova briefly became lost In dreams of a lilting Welsh voice, in the throes of an orgasm, calling his name. While he stood there dazed, his man gave him the\nslip, and before Casanova could catch\nhim, the medics had opened the scoring.\n0-1 to the medics.\nBut, if our enemies strike us down, we can only get stronger. Our fires\nsurged higher and not five minutes had passed before the Sundance Kid converted an unorthodox short corner. 1-1\nThe battle raged. Every tackle was hard\nfought; every pass had to count. 10 minutes before half-time, I a bio decapitated\none of the opposition in our D, and the umpire harshly gave the medics a short\ncorner. Despite our defences valiant\nefforts, the medics made it count. 1-2\nBut our heads were not bowed we cranked up the pressure, probing for\nchinks in their armour. It was nearly half-time when the Disco Squad broke through, and the ball fell to Indian Carpet Catalogue in the middle of the D. Time slowed. His heartbeat pounded out a frantic rhythm in his head. He dived and skimmed. Unnecessarily,\nbecause no-one was attempting to tackle\nhim. He picked his spot and flicked the ball into the air. It seemed to hang for-ever, before looping back down under\nthe bar and hitting the back of the net.\n2-2, and the crowd went wild.\nIn the second-half we took the game to them. Our spirits always gave us the edge, and this match was no exception.\nChances came again and again, but lady\nluck was not smiling on fil t rum, Lager\nLager and Indian Carpet Catalogue. But,\nwith less than 4 minutes to go, we won a short ie. The Sundance Kid swooped in\nand it was32 to the Disco Boys. Come on! And so, with this victory under our belts, promotion beckons more en tic ingly than Bronwyn after a brace of beverages and a hearty vomit. Disco!\n\n"

With a new remix of' Made it\nBack' blowing up all over again and her\nalbum getting a re-release I wondered how someone with so much going for\nthem could have there feet planted so\nfirmly on the ground. Probably some thing to do with her up bringing, she\nwas a gospel singer and had never\nsung outside of church until she left\nhome for college. Once she started\nsinging in clubs, as the support for o th ers, there was no looking back, she\nwas spotted soon and didn't look back.\nBeverley first blew up way back in 1995\nwhen she released a record that has\ngone on to become one of the hottest\nBritish R&B tunes of all time 'flavour of\nthe Old School'. It was massive in the\nclubs and was quickly followed by her\ndebut album 'The B Funk1\n, this earned praise from all quarters, but especially\nfrom the R&B heads. Beverley Knight\nhad arrived and was getting recognition as the best British soul prospect\nfor years, follow up singles ' Down for\nthe One' and the\n.wicked ' M ov in' On Up On The\nRight Side' did\nnothing but\nincrease the\nrespect for her. In\n1996 she won the\nprestigious Black\nMusic Award for\nbest R&B artist\nand was well one her way to dominating the R&B charts, but she\ndidn't! Beverley\njust disappeared\nand for two years\nnothing was heard from her, until the\nsummer of 1998 when she released\nthe stupendous' Made It Back' as the\nlead single of her second set 'Prodigal\nSista', Bev was back and back exactly\nwhere she left of.\nBeverley's 'Prodigal Sista' album got\ngreat reviews on its initial release in\nthe summer( we called it the best\nBritish album of the year), but is now getting a re-packaging and a re-release, I when over and asked the\ndiva why?\nMile n: When 'Prodigal Sista' was first\nreleased it got great reviews, so why are you re-releasing it? Were you unhappy with it first time round?\nBeverley Knight: No, not at all, the first\ntime the album was how I want it, it\nwas my album, its contents were per-fec t.M: That's my point, to us and to nuff\npeople who bought it, it was perfect so why the re-release?\nBK : The album sold well, it sold to pe ople who buy R& Band basically what we want to do with the re-release is to\nmake more people more aware of Beverley Knight, use It as a way of getting\nme into the minds of the public of\nlarge.\nM: So what is the new album gonna have on it that the old one didn't? BK : Its basically the same, the new set\nhas a few remixes and re-workings on It and is more of a vehicle to get on to\nradio and get a large share of the mar-ket, while maintaining my sound. M: The new' Made It Back' remix,\nwhere did that come from? There's this\nstory that someone did it, pressed it to\nwhite label, you heard it and liked it.\nBK Something like\nthat, but not quite. A DJ messed about\nI with the original, like\nthey do, and came. up with this mix, he I sent a tape to the\n:\u2022 . . \u2022\n\u2022\n. record company and\n' man's desk, he pl aut l loi me and\nyeah I liked it. The\ncompany decided it would be good idea to release the single and go for a wider audience, and from there we decided on the re-release of the whole album. M: What happened in those years\nbetween the first and second albums, I Devil's Pie by D 'Angelo\nknow you changed record company, but why such long gap?\nBK: Well, it was changing company that took so long, I was signed to a contract with Dome Records and I wanted out, things dragged out, but\nonce finished I looked at record companies to sign for and eventually\nsigned for EMI. Things take as long as\nthey take.\nM: Why did you split with Dome? BK : I or legal reasons I can't go into to\ndetails, but they had one opinion of where my career should be a landI had a totally different opinion. It was all about the direction of my sound and Dome weren'ton the same wavelength as me.M: What did Ihey want?\nBK : Well, Ihey were looking to make a sort of manufactured sound that was-n't what I wanted. M: Why did you choose EMI?\nBK : I looked hard al all the companies and EMI were the most attractive for\nme.I know they have a bil of a rep for\nbeing an indie label, but they are an\nartist driven label. They have real\nartists, they were willing to give me the\ncontrol over my own music and my\ncareer.\nM: Its well known that as a kid you sang gospel, why didn't you go into\nthat?\nBK: My parents wanted me to sing\ngospel, but there came a point where I had to decide which way I wanted to\ngo and I decided upon the big wide world of R&B. M: Were your parents disappointed?\nBK : Of course they were, but they did-n't stop me, they supported my decision and let me get on with it.\nAt the end of the day Beverly Knight is\na classy independent lady who has\nmassive amounts of talent. She has\nalways moved in a direction that she\nwants to go in, and that has always\nbeen one that the rest of us have\nloved. 'Prodigal Sista' is re-released in\nApril and the remix of ' Made it Back' is\nout on March22. This girl deserves\nhuge success and hopefully she will\nget it.\nMile n "

    "content": "14 Arts 8 March 1999\nA MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM THE RETURN OF DON JUAN\nPacific Northwest Ballet at Sadler's Wells Arc Dance Company at Sadler's Wells\nDuring their recent London debut,\nthe Pacific Northwest Ballet performed their interpretation of the\nShakespearean comedy A Midsummer\nNight's Dream, originally staged by the distinguished George Balanchine in\n1962. This lavish production, admirably\nredesigned by PN B Artistic Director f ran-cia Russell, is incident ly the first full-length remastered narrative to gain the approval of the choreographer's trust.\nPNB's portrayal of A Midsummer\nNight's Dream was flamboyant, with\nimaginative sets and costumes created\nby Martin Pakledinaz, inspired by floral\nRenaissance motifs. Combined with Felix\nMendelssohn' s enchanting score, this\nimaginative performance captured the magic and adventure of fairyland. Principal star, Patricia Barker (pictured left in\nfull flight) excels as the graceful Queen Titania, In a plot described by Balanchine\nas \" the resolution of the confusion and problems of loving and being loved\".\nAs an eight year old boy, Balanchine\nplayed the part of an elf in a Saint Petersb ur g theatre production of the Bard's fantasy comedy, which probably was his\ninitial Introduction to the piece. It therefore seemed rather appropriate to have\na crowd of young students from the company' s own school dancing as\ndelightful bugs in the ballet.\nAs one of the leading regional dance\ncompanies in America, this Seattle-based\ntroupe has displayed outstanding talent\nand superlative finish. Literally, a stunning\nspellbinding show. Tanya\nT he ballet's prologue takes place in\nHell. Dressed in a slick suit with\ntinted glasses, an enraged Devil is\nhorrified to discover the existence despite his villainous intentions - of a virtuous woman. Fie therefore enlists the services of the legendary philanderer,\nDon Juan, to corrupt and seduce this bastion of female chastity. The legendary\nLothario then leaves his 'purgatorial\nboudoir' of debauchery and travels to the\n20th century to accomplish his mission.\nThe potent themes of sexual manipulation and temptation explored by the ballet are then blurred by the superfluous\nand convoluted twists of the plot. In\nshort, the innocent victim works as an\nactress and the film director casts Don Juan as her partner.\nDanish composer Kim Hel weg blends an extensive variety of musical\nstyles ranging from jazz and pop to\nbaroque, creating an admittedly hap-hazard, yet innovative and energetic score with dominant percussion.\nThis dramatic comedy is basically a showcase for the talents of Kazan born\ndancer Irek Muk ham edo v( pictured left),\nprincipal dancer at the Moscow Bolshoi\nTheatre until his departure in 1990, with\nthe deterioration of the Soviet cultural\ninfrastructure. However this modern pro-duct ion, choreographed by Kim Brandstrup ( who also founded the fledgling\nArc Dance Company in 1985), unfortunately fails to fully challenge his classical\ntraining or highlight his acclaimed technical potential.\nHelena\nA MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM\nRose Bruford college at the ICA\nHelena loves Demetrius. Demetrius loves Hermia. Herm i a loves fy sander. Shakespeare invented neither the tragedy nor the comedy the Greeks took care of both but by setting his story in ancient Athens, he gives the audience an instant reference point. Frust rated lovers and harsh parents offering their daughters a simple choice between marriage to a villain or death on an altar. The Gods are often thrown in to complete the standard formula. Peering down from Mount Olympus in as lack hour, they always seem interested in the love affairs of mortals, so it's reasonable to assume that they must be jumping in to spread a bit of confusion and tragedy. Not quite. Shakespeare knew his audience, and while the middle aged Englishmen and women of the mid dle ages might enjoy a romance in\nforeign climes, they were n't the sort\nto tolerate meddling Greek deities. They wanted something a little closer to home, something with a hint of ambiguity and mixed motives. They wanted Fairies. No moss covered churchyard is truly complete without a hideous goblin and a detachment of spirits. No English forest should be without its whispering nymphs, ready\nto trick and confuse mortal travellers.\nSpilt the milk? The flighty Puck must have jogged your arm. Oberon and Titania, the Fairy\nKing and Queen, enjoy what might be termed an open relationship. Titan i a has acquired an Indian boy, of whom she is quite fond and Oberon is not. The jealous King sends Puck to\npluck a unique flower, struck many years before by a narrow from Cupid' s bow.\" The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid will make a man or woman madly dote upon the next\nlive creature that it sees\". Flower procured, Puck dabs it on the eyelids of Titania as she sleeps. Hilarity ensues. Towards the start of the recently released film Shakespeare in Love,\nHens low advises Shakespeare that\npeople who goto plays really want to see\" a kiss, a fight and a bit with a small dog\". There aren't any small dogs here, but there are the Rude Mechanical s, tradesmen commissioned to perform the tragedy of Pyramus and Thisby for the Duke of Athens' wedding feast. The only mechanical s of note are Ihe remarkably tall Peter Quince,a repressed carpenter with a crippling inferiority complex, and Bottom, a weaver of little knowledge but immense certainty.[ Note: The Mechanical s' tortured rehearsal scene, complete with an in-depth analysis of the play,\nis the first documented satire of the Amateur Dramatic societies that proliferated throughout20 th century Britain, a remarkable achievement since it was written in 1 596.1\nWhether a production of Midsummer Night's Dream flies or dies depends in large measure on Puck.\nThis one soars, as the nimble and extraordinarily talented Simon Watts fills the stage with energy from the moment he swings down from the cell ing to deliver the prologue. On the way to the ICA, I had wondered idly why Puck enjoys making mischief for others. Did he have an unhappy childhood? Simon Watts makes it plain that Puck is a child, and will remains of or ever. Whereas Peter Pan is the child who plays happily in the park with his friends, Puck is the infant who can't resist ducking the girls in the water and tying together the shoelaces of dozing adults. fairy queens area hard bunch to characterise, and the definition comes with the role. Many choose to portray a Princess Diana character, but although Meredith Bellamy shares the figure,s he doesn't really\nhave the same easy grace. Matthew Duque no y's Oberon is also slightly ponderous, more Jack Straw then Tony Blair.\nThe wheeling plot illustrates beautifully that \" the course of true\nlove never did run smooth\", but in\nthis case it's because these are the words with which Lysander comforts Hermia as she contemplates her choice between death or marriage. The players in this production are all\nfinal year students of the Rose Bruf or d College, and their performances did full justice to Shakespeare' s tragic omi c gem.A Midsummer Night's Dream will\nbe over by the time you read the review, but the Rose Burford students are performing again at\n7 . 3 0 pm on the9 th,10 th and11 th March. The play is Widows, by Ariel\nDorf man, and it's being shown at\nthe ICA ( top end of theM all,5 minutes from P icca dll y Circus). Ttienne Pollard\n\n"

    "content": "8\nMarch1999 if Qf\nIssue\n1 1 3 9\nKEEP THE CAT FREE EST. 1949\nThe Students' Newspaper at Imperial College Seven Year Wait For Clayponds Over?\nAfter a wait of over five years, it seems that\nthe residents of Clayponds Hall may finally\nget a Village Hall. Currently the hall has no\ncommon social area, and the construction\nof a separate building to house a common room has been rejected by college in previous years. However, It seems that the hall\nwill be built only if residents agree to a surcharge being added to their rent to cover\nthe cost.\nClayponds is a community of over\nthree hundred students, both undergraduates and postgraduates, consisting of flats within several houses. The entire site\nwas a residential development that was\nbought by the college part way through its\nconstruction, and has since been turned\ninto what is inappropriately called a vil-l age. Inappropriately because Clayponds\nhas never had any social area or common room; Joanne Christer, a sub warden at\nClayponds, described the TV room as \" a garage with a few seats in it\".\nThus in 1992 the then new warden,\nBy Ed Sexton\nDanny Segal (who was unavailable at the\ntime of writing), started a project to get a 'village hall' built for Clayponds. According\nto Jason Bain, who has lived at Clayponds\nfor over five years, \"there arc many people\nin college, for whatever reason, don't want\nthe common room built.\" Certainly little\nprogress has been made in that time - the\nproject has been discussed in college com-mitte es, such as the wardens' sub-com-mitte e and the Rector's Committee on Student Residences, proposals have been\nput forward, and the matter has then been\nquietly forgotten about. As current warden\nMarkTyrer put it, \"everybody thought it was\na good idea, but nothing happened\". Apparently some members of college have\nsuggested that not all the students at Clayponds want the hall to be built, an accusation that student representatives deny.\nOne senior student at the hall commented \"there seems to be a general feeling that\nthe Estates people are pretty apathetic\ntowards us, viewing us as out of sight, out\nof mind.\"\nAccrodingto Ian Caldwell, the Director\nof Estates, the proposed building would cost no more than \u00a375,000 - a small\namount when compared to other college\nprojects. As the building is part of a residence, however, it would have to be funded from the residences account. This\nis the crux of the problem - every year\nthese funds have been allocated to projects deemed to be more important.\nIndeed, Mark Tyrer was told by college\nthat \"there isn't the funds available\". Mr Caldwell did say, however, that he \"could\nsee the students' view\", stoically stating \"I build what I'm told to build\".\nThe latest plan appears to be to add\n90p onto Claypond's weekly rent for the\nnext five years, which would cover the\ncost of the hall. This proposal has had a mixed reception. According to Ms Christer\nthe students \"arc perfectly willing to do it,\nas long as it has what they want in it.\" Many\nobject to the move on principle, with one\nwarden describing as a \"rather ugly pre ce dent\". Mr Bain described the proposal as\n\"ridiculous\", stating \"the residents at Clayponds should not be singled out to pay for\nIhis facility.\" He went on to explain that \"the\nsituation with the common room is one of\nmany factors which has lead me to resign\nfrom the position of Assistant Warden.\"\nDavid Hellard has made clear his opinion\nis similar; \"I can't believe College can be so\npetty\". There is a glimmer of hope for Clayponds, however; Mr Caldwell cautiously\nstated that there \"might be the potential to\nfind some funding from somewhere else\nI other than students' rent]\". Mark lyre r summed up the current situation succinctly,-\"there is no reason why it couldn't be built\nthis summer.\"\nMedics Retain Hospitals Cup\nIC School of Medicine have once again\nconfirmed their place as one of the top student rugby sides in the country, after winning the prestigious UH Cup for a second\nsuccessive year.\nA final score ll ne of 21-12 over fellow\nnewcomers GKT (formerly Guys. Kings and\nThomas' Medical Schools; now part of Kings College) was the minimum the team\ndeserved after a performance which, in\ntruth, was superior to the opposition in\nalmost every department. In particular,\nICSM's set-piece play saw them press uris ng GKT at every opp our t unity, thanks to utter\ndomination in the line-out and fine work with the boot from Ian Macleod at full-back.\nAn early penalty from ICSM was followed up with fifteen minutes during which the ball never seemed to leave\nGKT's22. This non-stop pressure had to pay\noff, and eventually a well worked back-move rolled off a line out and saw the ball\nput down between the posts. The con-version, coupled with a penalty which resulted from relentless ICSM pressure put\nBy David Roberts\nPhoto: Dave\nthe score up to 13-0. Attempting to fight\nback, GKT mom cn tar illy moved out of their\nhalf, but good cover work coupled with\ndecisive kicking saw off the threat, and\nanother Macleod penalty on the stroke of\nhalf-time pushed the lead o ul to sixteen\npoints.\nAfter the interval, both teams came out looking to play a more expansive\ngame, which saw the ball rush from one end of the pitch to the other. Eventually,\nhowever, lapses in concentration coupled\nwith a few missed tackles saw GKT charge\ndown the field to notch up their first try and\nnarrow the gap to eleven points, this sudden impetus produced an immediate shot\nof adrenaline to GKT, who came alive with\na burst of powerful play. A penalty try,\nawarded for \"repeated infringements\" was\ntheir reward, and the gap became just\nfour points. But, with the lens ion now running incredibly high, ICSM's superiority\nshone through. A brilliant period of play\nsaw the ball pass through the hands of virtually every back, before finally being touched down in the corner, the crowd\nwent wild and poured onto the pitch; with\nICSM nine points in the lead and less lhan\nfive minutes to play, the result was no longer in doubt. The game resumed, but\na couple of minutes later the referee blew\nfor time, and ICSM Captain Ben Carpenter\nstepped up to collect the historic trophy.\nICSM Scorers:\nTries.- James Piatt, Alistair Morris\nPenalties: Ian Macleod(3) Conversions: Ian Mac l cod(1) Inside..m LGttGrS - More moaning 6\nEditorial - Clayponds 7\nColumns-SOYearsOn 8\nComic Relief 12\nCompetition 12\nArtS - Guys & Dolls 14\nBOOkS-HotSex 17\nFilm - Life is Beautiful 18\nClubscene - GUS GUS we 20\nMUSiC - Beverly Knight 22\nGames-PoolShark 25\nSpOft - Inter Departmental 26\nDiversions - Ihc next 7 days 27\n\n"

    "content": "16 Arts/Books 8 March 1999\nA LITTLE HOTEL ON THE SIDE\nRose Bruford College at the ICA\nT he Institute of Contemporary Arts\nhas surely one of the most trendy bars in London on its premises. How out of place I was in jeans, pullover and having nobody piercings. Leather trousers , hippie chic and cr emc de men the were de rig eur, it\nseemed. The assembled lu wie s stared\nat my chum's C&G rugby shirt, clearly\ntrying to decide if it was Bara dior McQueen. Are stripes in this year? Oblivious, we bought two pints of bit-ter. Minutes later the last call for the play rang out, sowed owned our ale and went to our seats in the audi to rium.\nI had no idea what to expect having never heard of the title or the playwright Georges Feydeau before and was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing heartily at some excellent stage slapstick. Nineteenth century French farce, it seems, is obsessed with ridiculing bourgeois society. It\nsets up respectable characters to drag their reputations through the mud, only to end upsetting all to rights in\nthe denouement. A truly classy performance was given by Matthew Bunting, playing the lead, Pinglct - a henpecked husband seeking to seduce his straight-laced\nneighbour's young wife. He held the stage like a West End pro and had the timing to match. He was admirably supported by a typically hypocritical\nrange of characters - a saucy maid, the' inspector of public morality', four\ngiggling schoolgirls and their adoptive father. Throw them all together for a night in a dod gy Paris hotel and the Carry-On style capers start apace. The company brought off the set piece gags brilliantly. The audience split their\nsides when a voyeuristic porter drilled\na peephole in a door to watch the cavorting hotel guests, but instead ended up puncturing Pinglet's back-side. The influence of the Fast Show\n(and possibly Shakespeare In Love)\nwas clearly apparent in Mathieu the barrister's( Rowan Talbot) stutter. When wanting to say '...very kind of madame to ask me to stay...' it came out 'very\nkind of madame to arse... arse... arSE...\nARSE... < kick/ stamp/ convulse> ASK me...' Some might say that this style of comedy is juvenile or unsophisticated, but that doesn't stop it being funny. When you turn up to a play with\nyour spirits do used by a day in front of a beige glowing box and leave clicking\nyour heels in the air and whistling a merry tune on your way to the tube, you know something is right. I had that light-hearted, lungs hurting feeling as I wound my way home on the Bakc r loo line. I have n't felt the as thor-ough ly entertained since I went to a seriously good night of stand up comedy at LSE more than a year ago. The thing is that a farce Is more than a set\nof jokes; the ironies and savage parodies of the self-assured snob ish ness of the middle classes of the time, eventhough they are not so relevant today,\nadd the extra dimension which makes the whole affair slightly more cerebral. This season of plays is a showcase for the graduates of Rose Bru ford, many of whom can be sure of employment if their professional work is up to\nthe quality of this performance. I used to have a poor view of drama stu dents, but if they can learn to entertain\nthis well I say keep up the good work.\nUnfortunately, this play will have run its\ncourse by the time this review gets\nprinted. If what Is aw is anything togo by, though, I would recommend going to see the last play in the season Widows, which runs from March9 to March11. lain\nANGEL BIRD by Sanjida O 'Connell\nSanji daO' Conn cl l,a television producer and director who has also\nwritten for New Scientist, happens to be a trained zoologist - and this fact is\nreflected quite clearly throughout much of Angel Bird. The first thing you notice\nabout the book( when reading it, of course!) is the attention to detail regarding the behaviour of magpies!\nNiall - we never learn his sur nam eis a zoologist from Cambridge studying\n(what else?) magpies in Northern Ireland. Niall has previously studied dun-nock s and his father is an authority on orchids. Fair enough. Niall's study of magpies involves him rearing five of the birds. He even gives them all names Rinky, Rannee, Rena, Ron and Riordan.\nBut this is all irrelevant detail.\nNiall just happens to be one of those\nmen who' s handsome, clever and smart,\nas well as being somewhat messed-up.\nHe lands up with two lovers - Eddie, an ambitious and( obviously) beautiful chef,\nand Nadia Ismail, daughter in the \"first\nAsian family to move to Northern Ireland\". Eddie, of course, knows nothing about Nadia and only discovers by what,\nI'm sorry, has to be one of the most\ncontrived twists of plot I 've ever read in\nwhat purports to be a work of serious,\nquality fiction. The repeated references\nto the violence and confused personal\nlives of the magpies are naturally\nmetaphorical - perhaps laid on too thickly.\nSome descriptions of violent attacks\nbetween magpies, and 'the war of the crows', are excessively graphic but lack\nany real sense of terror. The reader is left\nfar too detached from the action.\nOn the whole, Niall is the kind of person one tends to leave at an arm's length\nafter a bit because he grows steadily\nannoying I was certainly tempted to\nshut the book about three-quarters of the\nway through and just give up, although\nI'm glad I didn't do so. None of the other\ncharacters is built up sufficiently convincingly, however, and that has to be one of the biggest weaknesses of the\nbook. Otherwise, the depiction of life in\na little Irish village is certainly worth read-ing; pity that the zoology sometimes gets in the way. We don't really want to\nknow every last detail regarding the sex\nlife of a magpie, not in a work of fiction\nat least! Niall- becomes increasingly\nobsessed with his birds and the realisation of his lost past - his lost childhood comes as he is on the brink of making a major scientific discovery - he essentially\nloses all grip on reality only to be \"res-cued\" by Eddie.\nThe author's first work of fiction, ThcoryofMind, was written to much acclaim,\nwinning a number of awards. While Angel Bird Is certainly entertaining and readable, it's a real pity that there are so\nmany scattered hints about the ending. Ultimately then, this is a creditable seco nd effort without a stifling sense of pretentiousness - not particularly brilliant,\nbut a very good read nonetheless, with\nsome definite signs of originality. I know that I 'll look out for other works from this\nauthor!\nSun/7 Rao\n\u00a36.99 from Black Swan Publishing\n\n"

The tracks feature music\nsuch as house, funk, jazz, progressive\nand some good old \"normal\" D&B; each\ntune slowly builds up, starting gently\nbefore hitting you with D&B sounds which then gradually fade into the calm\nfinale. This is an album that is meant for\npeople who like all kinds of music - a superb collection of tunes.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAstral Projection\n'Another World'\n(Transient)\nThis is the sixth album from the finest\nIsraeli trance act ever (personally I know of no other Israeli trance acts but who' s counting?). A nine-track album, 'Another\nWorld' is trance music at its best - so much so that,DJs such as Danny Rampling have given the tracks glowing reports. The music is very much like that\nreleased on the Perfecto label - fast\nbeats, hard bass lines, lots of pianos/\nsy th s and, of course, plenty of break-downs. And because it's good quality fast\ntrance it's great to dance to. Astral Projection, the true originators of psy trance, will soon be touring in London to help\npromote the album and if you want more info, then pop into the Felix office.\nOut In March \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nNiko Marks& City Boy Players\n'City Boy Players'\nthis is one hell of an album a lot of\nvariety and great tunes, the only problem\nis the album is not long enough!! This\nis aCD which joins together house, soul,\ndisco, R&B, gospel, jazz and electron lc a to form a collage of wigged-out, funk\ngrooves and Afro American musical\nfusion. The album has 1S tracks and takes you on a journey through all the\nprevious mentioned styles whilst featuring the vocal talents and brilliant jazz\npiano of Niko Marks. Coming from Detroit, you would have expected it to be\nmore techno-sounding than it actually is,\nbut the album show show fusing different sounds together can make a great\nsounding album simply because of the\nvariety on offer.\nOut at the end of March* \u2022\u2022\u2022\n\u2022 ' A\" Gur m Gus Gus @ ULU\nLast Friday, Joel and I( and my flat\nmate who randomly turned up) braved\nthe pissing rain to go and see Iceland's finest (but most under-rated) band Gus Gus at UL U. Having never been to UL U before I was surprised at how small the venue was, but within an hour the place\nwas packed and I was glad I had left my crutches at home( after last week's farce\nat Turnmills there was no way I was bringing them), for the first hour and a half we were treated to a warm-up jock who played great house music both progressive and hard, but I felt a bit sorry for\nhim as no-one seemed to notice him. Gradually the clock approached9:30 pm and the atmosphere built up in anticipation of Gus Gus. And then they came on stage to a standing ovation (okay I 'll\nadmit there were n't any seats), and immediately Gus Gus( six guys and a girl) took us through a trip of great music.\nIt's hard to define the music they prod u ce since it encompasses techno, dance, indie, house all sorts, the crowd was treated to a great mix of tunes.\nThe tunes were mostly recent stuff\nbut there were a few classics dropped in\nthere, including the fabulous 'Believe'\nwhich went down a storm. The at mo sphere was intense and Gus Gus, playing\ntheir first UK gig for over a year, joined the crowd, in jumping up and down, and madly waving their hands in the air during the harder tracks, whilst the couple of soft songs saw the crowd swaying\ngently as the lights dimmed. Tosser of the night had to go lo the\nblok e dancing in front of poor old Joel.\nHaving only grabbed a few hours sleep\nin the last thirty hours or so, Joel ( who could barely stay awake) spent the gig dancing behind a blok e who not only\nhad the worst haircut in the world, but\nwho also took great pleasure in shoving\nthe frizzy mass into Joel's face - until Joel\nkicked up a fuss, when he promptly tied\nup his hair using his girlfriend's bobble.\nStill, lh at didn't stop us from shoving him\nin the back cv cry time he stepped back-wards.\nBack on stage, and Gus Gus were screaming out the lyrics over the th um ping bass lines, and when one of the guys started singing in a Maurice Gibb\nvoice we started wondering If this was a tribute to the BeeGees. The show culminated when the lead singer asked \" Do you wanna hear techno?\" to the crowd. Naturally we shouted that we would and Gus Gus promptly blared out a fabulous\ntechno track with hard bass lines and minimal vocals before launching into\nlady s have', their latest single. All\nthroughout the gig, weird images and messages were projected on to a screen\nbehind the stage adding to an already\nelectric atmosphere. An hour and half later it sadly finished - Gus Gus came on for an encore\nand then left the crowd to mull about\nuntil the lead singer came out and said\n\"No guys, it's finished....cheers\". This\nwas a great gig and Felix has to thank\nJustin at 4 AD records for letting us come and review a fabulous night.\nGus Gus Scandinavian and Strange, now there's a surprise!\nGurm\n\n"

It is very charming and funny but also painful and very m ov ing. Co-written and directed by that\nmaster, of comedy, Roberto Benign i, the film stars him along with his real-life wife Nicol etta Braschi. Significantly, it won the Grand Jury\nprize at last year's Cannes film festival\nand recently got seven foreign film\nOscar nominations. The story starts\njust before WorldWar II in Racist Italy\nand ends at the war'send. During this\nperiod, across Europe, Jews, Gypsies, and handicapped people were first\npersecuted and then later detained and killed under Nazi/Facist 'master\nrace' theories. The first part of the film is a love\nstory. Roberto Benign i arrives from the countryside to work as a waiter In a lavish restaurant owned by his uncle, in\nthe hope of realising his dream of opening a bookshop. In scene after\nscene, reminiscent of great Charlie Chaplin works, we learn of this man's approach to life; sharp, humourous, and charming. Through a series of Italy's answer to Woody Allen and Jim Carrey? Poor blok e. serendipitous events he manages to seduce rich young Nicol etta Braschi\n( who is engaged to another man, a part of the Facist hierarchy, who she doesn't like much). The first signs of the forthcoming discomfort are felt when Benigni's uncle gets his horse painted with racist slogans. It is only then that\nwe know that Benign i is a Jew. Before we know it, the couple are married, he has opened a bookshop, and they have\na smart lovely child.\nThe remaining part of the film will,\nnaturally, make you feel uncomfortable. It is about the experience of father, son, and, on the other side of the camp, mother( who demands to\njoin. them eventhough she's not a Jew) in a concentration camp run mainly by Germans. There cannot possibly be anything to excuse the concept of a concentration camp, but Benign i for the sake of his child keeps his sense\nof humour. By focusing on the young boy's story, the film is in the end an optimistic one but watch out for the moving end! By all means go and watch this\nfilm, not to learn what Schindler's List\nhas already told you before, but to learn about the essence of life,- man's quest for peace, enjoyment and, ultimately, survival. This film should make you think about the unacceptable forms of hatred and persecution that\nexist today in many parts of the world, and hopefully move you to do something about it.II\nAhmed\nYou've Got Mail * * \u2022 \u2022\nStarring : Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Parker Posey, Greg Kinnear\nDirector: Nora Ephron\nSlushy this film maybe but Sleepless in Seattle it is not. You've Cot Mail is an up-to-date\nreworking of the1940 classic The Shop\nAround The Corner by Ernst Lubitsch.\nThis time around, however, rather than\nbeing anonymous pen pals, our two central characters are falling in love\nover the Internet.\nMeg Ryan is Kathleen Kelly who runs a children's bookstore,' Shop Around The Corner' in New York.\nAlthough butter wouldn't melt in her mouth, she is having an on-line affair\nwith NY512 under the pseudonym of Shopgirl. This is no seedy or sordid affair\n-just a simple, innocent conversation of life, love and dreams carried out across\ntheir email. Of course, NY512 is Hanks (step-ping into the shoes of James Stewart,\nwho played the character in the orig i nal), a member of the family that has just opened a huge department book store almost on Ryan's door step. BusiIDeep sigh of contentment].\nness begins to diminish in her small\nshop and so she starts to despise Hanks\nand everything he stands for. Moreover,\nshe also takes pleasure in telling him what she thinks of him every time they\nmeet. However, when they are not working they log on and wait for those three magic words you' ve got mail -with (of course) no Idea that their anonymous love is their bitterest enemy. The plot is extremely simple and the dialogue flows so realistically that\nyou believe Ryan and Hanks could really\nbe destined for each other. These two possess a kind of magic rarely seen between two people in real life, never-mind on the big screen, and director\nEphron ( who also directed Sleepless) is\ncareful not to interfere. It's so obvious\nwhy they paired these two together again.\nEventually, however, this becomes the film's downfall the last twenty minutes are painstakingly boring as you wait to see the inevitable. The film is\nlong enough without this extra padding.\nYou know what is going to happen so this makes the film a little predictable.\nThat said, however, the loose ends eventually tie to give you one of the best\nromances to hit the big screen in quite\na few years. O Helen\n\n"

Complaints were received by College from the train operator suggesting that a group of IC students had vandalised a train carriage,\nn clu ding \"breakages, abusive behaviour, and vomiting\". The reason for this\nbehaviour was put down to \"extreme\nne bri ation\". According to sources close to the\nteam, the students involved are admitting that their actions did cross the line,\nbut will ask to be treated sympathetically\nas this would be their first offence. A Momentary Lapse\nof Confidence?\nRoyal School of Mines Union President\nAlistair Fox attempted to pass a motion of no confidence in DP (C&S) Marie Nic hol oau at Union Council last Tuesday. This would, if passed, result in her\ndismissal from the post, and possibly the\nre-running of the sabbatical elections, as\nMr Fox es pressed dissatisfaction with\nher performance as Returning Officer.\nHowever, he did not follow the correct\nprocedures (which require him to warn the Chair in advance, so that evidence can be gathered on both sides) and the motion was rejected. Mr Fox\nintends to resubmit his motion at the\nnext Council, on4 May, by which time the true motivations for his actions should have come to light.\nMore discounts\nThanks to the continuing efforts of ICU\nPresident Dave Hellard, the number of\nlocal stores offering discounts for IC students continues to grow.

The directive, which came into force\non October 1 1998, goes on to describe\na stringent set of working practices including regular rest periods and free health\nassessments for night staff. The college is\ncurrently in contravention of the legis la tion, with many security staff working72 hours a week; but as Government approval came only a few weeks before\nimplementation, employers have been given a temporary respite.\nCategorised as \"self-determining\" acad emi c staff arc exempt from the measures as they have autonomy over their\nworking hours, the college has been aware of the working time regulations for\nsome time, but chose to wait for all\nexemptions to be finalised in the hope that security staff would be unaffected,\nthe situation has still not been clarified,\nbut the college m usl now face the task of\nbalancing staff wages with reduced working hours. Michael Saul, security's Unison\nRepresentative, saw the benefits of the\nnew regulations commenting \"Ifs a good thing, it stops employers exploiting their\nworkers\", but went on to say \"the problem is security are lowly paid, the only way\nto make the job sustainable is overtime.\"\n1992 saw the last major upheaval in\ncollege security, where a proposal to dispense with in-house security staff and\nBy Andrew Ofori\nput a contract out to tender\nwas defeated by the magnitude of opposition. This\nlead lo the introduction of shift work,\nand put an end to the 48 hour week college security had previously operated.\n\"We don't feel we should lose any-thing, but I should imagine we arc going lo\" was the prediction from one security\nofficer as he explained the app re hen sion of his contemporaries. Another officer warned \"If they only pay 48 hours...\nthey could end up with a mass exodus\".\nIhe Chief of Security, Ken Weir, is\nresearching into exactly which of the regulations applied to his staff and felt officers had little to worry about al such a preliminary stage of the reforms, but conceded \"Ihe 48 hour working week is likely\nto adversely affect the se curt iy staff\". He\nslated he is \"currently looking al several\nways in which we can overcome our legal\nobligations that were laid by the working\ntime directive\", explaining \"We've got no\nlegal choice, we have to make reforms.\"\nKeith Reynolds, Head of Security con-cur red: \"Whether wc like it or not, we're\ngoing to have to re-structure to some degree...we're not going to be able to\nplease everybody all of the time\", but he\nsaw the alterations as a chance to create\na better system.\nAny proposals will be subject lo\nextensive consultation with college\ndepart mc nl s as well as organisations such\nas the I leal th and Safety Executive and\nthe final decision lies with the Managem en l Planning Group. Security's Mr Saul\nwas convinced \"they'll [college] approach\nit in a sensible way\" and Ken Weir assured:\n\"the security of the college is not going to be compromised in anyway\".

They appeared to have picked\nthugs off the street at random and paid\nthem a Fiver each to play. Their game consisted of pummelling the opposition whenever the referee wasn't watching and often when he was! Luckily, we quickly learnt to skate away from the\nplayers who had their knuckles scraping\non the floor.\nThe Imperial plays were more mixed\nup than a well-shaken martini, but simply sterling goaltending from Nerissa\nheld them at bay until the last seconds of the game when they happened into\na fluke goal.\nThe next match was against the best\nCambridge had to offer. Drew score a nifty goal late in the match but it wasn't enough as they bulldozed two past our borrowed Warwick goalie\nAfter a beautiful two game rest we came back strong against Warwick with\nour plays sorted out; Mo and Ket driving\nthe Imperial offensive like a fine-tuned\nFerrari with Narissa and Lisanne putting\nup a brick wall of defence. We achieved\na shut out and were just getting down to some serious offense when the whistle was blown. The closing game was with Cam bridge, our team had improved about\n1 5 0 % since the beginning of the tour-name nt and some very fine hockey was had by all, with splendid defence from\nThor and SpeaDFreaK. Unfortunately, the\nweak keystone was our borrowed Goalie,\nwho let one sneak past him in the op e ning seconds. A very close fourth in the end; not a bad effort for aB team that had never\nbefore played together, playing against\nA teams. Massive thanks go to Nerissa\nand Lisanne for driving. And finally, special love to Lisanne's Mum for cooking us dinner!\nINTERDEPARTMENTAL RUGBY\nCivil Engineering 'Brickies' 76 - 49\nMechanical Engineering 'Spanner Boys'\nRugby Match/ Rowing( Boat Race)\nAfter last year's debacle when civil lost 25\n- 0, the brick ies were keen to set the record straight - which they did in\ntremendous style. A blinding start gave\nthe hard hats an early lead. Some incisive\ninterplay between Stricko's teeth and Gnat Chum's head soon put a stop to all\nthis. When they had left the field, the oil\nmonkeys clawed their way back to par-it y: at half time they lead by two con versions and looked like running away with it. Me ch Eng's' Orange leprechaun' Cosby and 'village' Stevens were vicious\ngrowling beasts in attack, with Sven and Phil making some storming runs. From\nhere on in, though, Clvil'sAndy' Big' Little and Brad 'The Bucket' Baskett pushed the pace up a few notches and it all\ncame together in the last five minutes.\nBrad ended with six tries and 'Big Daddy'\nRam age put two over the posts. Special\nmention must go to Greg from Civ Eng,\nwho learnt the rules of the game in ten\nminutes, then played as to rmer. Switch to the Harlington bar for the seco nd half. Two boat race teams of eight\nwere assembled. Unsurprisingly, Civ. Eng.\ntook advantage of their experience and snatched the lead straight away, being one man up after a smooth four second downing from lain. Me ch Eng got off\nmore slowly, but kept a more steady rating which averaged slightly higher. The\ngap was closed and there was no clear\nwater, but the mechanics caught a crab,\nso the scaffold ers could pull away again\nto victory. Including the football, that\nmakes Civil 3 - Mechanical 0, time to pull\nyour wrenches out of your builders'\ncleavage lads!\nIt seems that the spirit of the departments is finally growing into something tangible... keep up the good work! Anyo ne for cricket?\nOSC - Basketball\nThe overseas societies basketball tour-name nt was held on the 27th February.\nThe day was won by the Afro-Caribbean\nSociety 2nd team. After a long morning when some societies decided not to\nturn up, the afternoon matches started\nto flow more smoothly. There was some high quality basketball mal che s, tight\ndefence and inspired attacks.\nFair play to the Lebanese and Malaysian\nsocieties for their sporting spirit.\nThanks to all who made the event a success, specially the referee's and team\ncaptains.\nThe next tournament should be football\nin the 3rd team. For info mail\ndavid.e ahl@ ic.ac.uk.\nJUDQ\nThe IC judo club attended a belt grading\n(to go up a belt) at the London Judo\nsociety on the 28th. Overall good performances by the people present mean l that the club now boasts more rainbow colours than must really exist. Congratulations to Danuta, Chris, Nicholaides,\nDavid and Duncan. For more info visit the judo web page on the union web site.\nSKIING\nOverall, the day was fairly normal with\ngood performances by the whole team as usual (4th overall in parallel racing,\n2nd overall in individual times, 3rd place\nsnowboarding for Dave Best!).\nHowever, the captain was noticed having very friendly discussions with the\nUCL club president. Rumours have it\nthat he was asking for certain services.\nThe captain was later beaten in the race,\nhis excuse being that he was laughing\nat the UCL club president's fall. Arrogant\nfrenchman, serves him right!\nULTIMATE FRISBEE\nIC 21 - 4 Kings\nIt was no surprise when Kings turned up\n(late as usual) with only 5 player (at least\n7 needed for a team). Fortunately, due to an unusually keen turn-out by IC (all\nexcept 'Worship me', who complained of the flu so was sent to bed with his\nwoman), we could lend them a few of\nour (best) players, although this meant\nthat Kings had to forfeit the game, making it only a friendly. This game was the\nlast chance for a practice before the\nNational Indoor student finals (yes, that\nmakes IC in the top16 student teams in\nthe country!), so the first team were out\nto justify their place. As the sc or cline shows, IC disposed of kings with few casualties, but not after some defiant\nKings defending. The first half was an\neasy walkover for IC. but come the seco nd half Kings were keen to show IC\nhow they could really play. In the end the score was inevitable though, another\nass kicking by IC.\nThe game was played in great s piri( no fouls there then) and helped to\nbuild strong links between IC ultimate\nteam and Kings ultimate team.

    "content": "8 March 1999\nRight Angles To Reality\nThe Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing But the Truth\nT he truth, as they say, is only half\nthe story. As a tender young in no cent, off school with 'flu and rel-i shing the illicit pleasure of eating Shipp ham's pilchard and tomato paste\nsandwiches and watching daytime TV,\nI was often confused as to why the witnesses appearing on' Crown Court' were asked to swear that the evidence they were about to give was the truth,\nthe whole truth and nothing but the truth so help them God. To my at the time un sullied mind( I had yet to twig the hidden meanings of the names of the characters in Captain Pugwash) this\ndidn't make sense why the need for\nsuch a distinction; the truth is the truth,\nisn't it? It is no secret that I was a late\ndeveloper in more ways than one( I still\nhad Cam berwick Green wallpaper in\nmy bedroom right up until the summer before my'O' levels which I'm sure was instrumental in me only getting a n'E' In Media Studies, and which pro b ably had more than a little to do with my humiliating failure to cop off with Emma 'bury me in aY shap cd coffin' Slattery with who m,I was reliably informed, I was on a promise). At the time the twin concepts of the half-truth and the white lie had still not occurred tome. However, as Peter, Paul and Mary noted: \"dragons live forever, but not so little boys\" and when this little Jackie Paper\nstarted at Big School he had to grow up quickly. One of the first of many rude awakenings which awaited me when I and a couple of hundred other clammy palmed conscripts pitched up for Basic Training on the first\nday of term, was the idea that truth was not a black and white issue but was actually a continuum of an infinite variety of shades of grey. As rude awakenings go, it could have been a lot\nworse I went to the local comprehensive where public school entertainments such as the Biscuit Game and the Daisy Chain were thankfully unheard of but it was still a bit of a shock I can tell you. However, I adapted to this new environment with depressing ease and within a couple of weeks I was half-truth ing with the best\nof them. Viewed from my current perspective, desperately treading wafer in a world of Arms-to-lr an, Cash-for-Quest ions and Homes for Votes, the fact\nthat I was once capable of such in no... the fact that I was\nonce capable of\nsuch innocent\nthought strikes me\nas incredible...\"\ncent thought strikes me as incredible. However, if social commentators are to be believed, only a generation ago the whole world was a much more moral, truthful and trusting place. Back\nwhen maps of the globe contained more pink than any other colour, a politician could refer to\" polling the electorate\"\nwithout raising a smile, and scoutmasters were upright members of society. A lot has happened since then, though. Richard Nixon' s Watergate, Ronald Reagan' s Irangate and Peter\nMan dci son's Notting Hill Gate have\nshattered the image of our elected representatives as dashed good chaps in it for the satisfaction of serving the public, and nowadays a crusty ex-army\ntype would never be able to get away with taking a group of teenage lads off to Brown sea Island without the involve-ment of Social Services. But there you have it: 'fin gs ain't what they used to\nbe.'\nAs you' d expect for an essential\nskill for anyone wanting to survive in\nthe modern world, lying comes in\nmany forms and degrees of serious-ness. In my experience, the porky pie spectrum runs from the socially acceptable\nand expeditious no-honestly-it- looks-fine-on-you-darling white lie to out and out just-let-me-have-Czechoslo\nva kia and-Poland-and -we'll-call-it-quits prem edit a ted deceit. Somewhere in the middle there is the loosely defined cate gory of the half-truth, a phenomenon dubbed by Alan Clark, the well known man-about-just-about-c very town, occasional MP and erstwhile inventor of a highly idiosyncratic version of the Generation Game, as being\" economical with the actual lte\". But\nwhether you are simply Joe Average trying not to get on the wrong side of your miss us,a mono testate megalomaniac or a lecherous Thatcherite has-been, one sad fact stands out: honesty is not necessarily the best policy. There\ncan be times when telling the whole unvarnished truth can leave you worse off than If you' d simply kept your gob shut. A case in point is my mate Terry.\nIf I tell you that he has bacon sandwiches for breakfast, likes his tea white with twelve sugars and smokes Benson Matt Salter\n\"...as rude\nawakenings go, it\ncould have been a lot worse...\"\nand Hedges, you might hazard a guess that Terry\nis a builder. Spot on. I met him when he came to repair the house next door after a particularly\nraucous Tupper war c party in 1997, and we instantly became friends. I hadn't seen him since then until I bumped into him quite by chance in\nour local, the Sheep and Spec ul um, the other Ihursday night.\nAfter much back-slap-ping and many a'\" ow' ve yoo bin my san\" we settled down at a corner table\nwith a pint of hideously expensive fizzy\nlager each( ferry was buying) and I asked him what he'd been up to for the last year or so. It turned out that he' d only just got back from Stavanger in\nsouth-west Norway where he' d been working for the last eight months as\nsite foreman on a job building sheltered accommodation for blind and sight-impaired Norwegian pensioners. Apparently the national and regional governments had stumped up the cash\nfor the state-of-the-art facility and Terry's firm had bid for, and won, the contract. \"I were n't too keen on go in' to start 'w iv\", Terry informed me, \"bat\nthe money was o wright and I 've always\nwanted to try a bit a the old Scandinavian,' nat tame en? Hur gh, hur gh, hur g h\".I asked him what the work had been like. It\nwas\" fac kin' la vcr ly\" by\nall accounts,56 single and30 double bedrooms each with en suite bathrooms, specially designed with the sight impaired person in mind. Terry burbled on about the landscaped gardens, the kitchens, the dining areas and the common rooms and in a fit of excitement he gripped my armand told me that\n\"all them corridors right, they was made' w iv all stripped pine floorboards\".\" Norwegian Wood?\" I asked him in a weak attempt at humour, but he just\nlooked at me blankly.\nWhen Terry told me about the kind\nof money he'd been on, I was tempted to go straight round to B&Q, arm myself with a bag of tools and Black\nand Decker work mate and get on the next plane to Oslo myself. Better than that, enthused Terry, the whole construction team had been promised a sizeable production bonus payable on completion of the project by the stipulated date. According to Terry, it was going to be a bit tight time wise but it\nwas by no means impossible. Thus,\nspurred on by the thought of non sneeze-at table financial gain, brick i es,c hippies and plumbers had buried their\nprofessional differences and toiled away like mad things to make sure\nthat they got finished on time. The superstructure of the building was soon up and the fittings and fixtures\nwere well under way. As I have already\nmentioned, each room in the facility\nwas to have an en suite bathroom comprising bath/shower, toilet and sink\nunit, all specially designed to meet the needs of the sight impaired. I his,\napparently, was where the problem started. The supply of bathroom furniture was brought in from Oslo by\nship, a journey of some500 miles requiring around two days. At the start\nof the job, all the required baths, toilets etc. had been brought in, but over\nthe course of the journey and during several months lying around the site, a number of the units had got broken so\nthat when the plumbers came to install\nthe last bathroom suite, they found that they were exactly one sink short.\nWhat were they to do? The work was-n't finished, the deadline was set for\nthe following day and a replacement part would never make it from Oslo in\ntime, for the want of one measly piece of porcelain, each mem ber of the team stood\nto lose their bonus, lying COmeS in many As foreman, responsibility fell on Terry's forms and ded fees shoulders. He had two options: admit that they'd missed the target, and lose all\nthat filthy lucre, or lie and cheat his way\nout of it. No choice really. In a fit of\ninspiration, he took one of the hods used by the bricklayers, welded a metal\nplate on the open side, cut a hole in\nthe bottom and plumbed it in, before ringing the customer and telling him that everything was in order. Not quite\na lie, but not exactly the truth. \"Weren't you worried you' d get found out? I mean, when some old codger goes to\nuse that particular washbasin he'll tum ble it straight away, surely\" I suggested, ferry smiled and lit another fag.\" No chance mate they'll never know the difference.\" \"Don't be silly, of course they will.\" \" Nah they won' t\"he laughed,\" don't chak now the old saying - 'A hod's as good as a sink to a blind Norse?'\"\"... as you' d expect\nfor an essential skill,\nof seriousness\n\n"

Didn't this get reviewed last month on the Playstation? Yes it is the same title, the same set of weird\ntables, the same large number of\ndifferent types of games can be\nplayed and all using the long stick to knock the round things\ninto the pockets. (A cheat here is\nnot all the balls have to be pock-e ted. Only about half of them are needed in order to win the computer opponent cheated in this underhand manner every time). So it is the same game, but\nnot necessarily played in the same way.\nFirstly the graphics. PCs with 3-D acceleration cards would be expected to have\nbetter graphics, and they do. The shading of the tables is much more detailed than\nthe PSX. The transparent techno table looks superb. The control method is also different. Instead of the simplistic power bar there is a slightly more complex mouse control method using the swing of the mouse to actually control the force of the\nstroke. It does take a bit of time to\npractice it, but within a couple of minutes gentle close shots don'tend up with the cue ball in the pocket. The control method was the bane of the Playstation version\nand with a simple bit of tweaking\nit plays a lot more like a game of pool. I in ally I can recommend it -very good work fell as. Gary S. Gremlin\nWhen this dropped on the desk a sudden sense of deja vu echoed through the office. Didn't this get\nreviewed last month on the\nPlaystation?\nWait a minute didn'tI just get\na sense of deja vu a minute ago. Deja vu of deja vu - now that's odd. Anyway Premier Manager99 on the PC is still all about mana g ing your favourite team to the\ntop of the league and as much silverware as the cupboard can hold - or if you are feeling perverse taking your hated\npremier team down to the third division before being sacked.\nWith the memory and disk space of the PC you would expect some improvement\nover the Playstation version. The players actually come with mini photos so you can\nscare children off by playing the game using the images of Tony Adams and Paul Mcrson. There is also a lot more detail, with the inclusion of such important details as\nyouth programmes and scouts for the youth teams. Ihe third improvement has got\nto be the a bil ty to use the mouse and keyboard. Rather than cycling through millions\nof different screens to gel to the\nscreen you want you can use the\nmouse to get there.\nAnother improvement over the\nPSX version (this is spook i ly like PC\nPoohShark), but it is enough. It is\nthe best football management game currently out, but look out\nbecause championship manager\nis about to come into play.\nGary 5.\nGremlin Giveaway - PC PoohShark and PM99\nWanna shoot some pool?

It\nhas fairly Impressive stats - getting near\nthe theoretical maximum number of polygons displayable on a conventional IV,\nand a launch date this winter. Knowing the Japanese, the US market gets first\npick - expect a realistic UK launch some time in Autumn2000. At its heart it has the emotion engine a chip that Sony and Toshiba claim is\nmore powerful than the current Pentium\nIII. Hopefully, if the games are as good as the released screenshots we might\njust be able to put up with it being called\nsomething like the emotion machine.\nFree ISP's( Internet Service Providers) are\nflooding the market.

Every year we spend all the res-i den ces' money on more important pro-j ect s, such as making sure current halls are\nsafe, pleasant, and not about to fall down. You wouldn't want us to neglect student\nsafety for the sake of a common room, would you?\" Of course not. The answer is\nsimple - give the residences pot some more cash. We are talking 3 % of the boat\nhouse's cost; less than half a percent of the BMS' bill. Sell off some of the excess\ngranite from the flowerbeds, reduce some of the six figure salaries in Sherfield by a few percent, and you're half way there.\nDon't like that idea? Oh, Iam surprised...\nAt the end of the day the problem is\nClayponds' location. It isn'ta fashionable\nproject, It isn't extravagant or likely to be\nrecognised as a great construction\nachievement.

We can\nargue about the ethics afterwards. And argument there should be; charging residents for new hall facilities sets a dangerous precedent.

People argue endlessly about whether certain drugs arc harmless,\nwhether they affect your cognition, etc\netc. Well, excuse me, but the hormones and neurotransmitters that alter and, yes,\noccasionally harm your mental make-up\narc just as powerful as any 'artificial' drug.\nLike it or not, you see the world through\nan ocean of powerful chemicals that constantly change how you perceive and respond to the outside world.\nAs for the drugs argument? I'm rapidly\ncoming to the conclusion that people who have not taken a certain drug can\nnever argue effectively with those who have experienced it, simply because the\ntwo groups start from different premises,\nreflecting the change in attitude that\ninevitably results from drug use.\nAnyway, there's a pro-legal is ation march in London on May1( assuming the\norganisers aren't too stoned to hold it),\nand Id are say I 'll see a good few of you there.\nA Word of Warning\nThere was a time, no l much more than a decade ago, when Union hacks of any\ndescription were no l allowed in the Felix\nOffice, and Felix club members were viewed with suspicion in the confines of the Union. In recent years this dividing line\nhas withered away, and many of you have probably noticed that Iam more 'pro\nUnion' than my predecessor. I have even\nbeen called Dave Hellard's lap-dog, and\nthe voice of the Union, by some students.\nWell, it may not last. The Union has\nbeen good this year, with a goods abb team, and has generally acted in a way\nthat I feel has directly benefited the students of this college (which is my over-rid-ing concern). I here arc things in the pipeline, however...\nSo, master Hcllard and others, I'm sorry if I offend any of you in the next four\nmonths please remember to separate\nprofessional criticism from personal prejudices. And if anyone feels they have\nbeen treated badly by ICU or college;\nFelix is your independent voice. - Ed\nAssistant Warden\nClayponds Village\nEnthusiastic applicants are sought for the post of\nAssistant Warden at Clayponds Village, from 1st April\n1999.
