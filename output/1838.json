    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial Editorial | 3\nISSUE #1838\nU\nniversity league tables are curious\nthings. They purport to serve prospective\nstudents, distilling hand-wavy, qualitative\nconcepts, such as teaching quality, innovation,\nand reputation into one neat number \u2013 a single,\ngolden metric that is used to sort academic\ninstitutions and separate the wheat from the\nchaff. But primarily, they serve the coffers of the\npublications that compile them, providing easy,\nattention-grabbing headlines, and proprietary\ndatasets that can be monetised.\nDespite this, students, parents, and universities\nascribe an inordinate level of importance to such\ntables. And so, we have to hand it to People &\nPlanet (P&P), the student campaigning group\nthat has taken the idea of university rankings and\nrepurposed it to hold universities accountable for\ntheir sustainability efforts.\nEach December, P&P releases its very own\n\u2018University League\u2019\n, which it describes as \u2018the only\ncomprehensive and independent league table\nof UK universities ranked by environmental and\nethical performance\u2019\n.\nP&P\u2019s environmental league table matters:\nThe Guardian, a national newspaper, has been\npublishing it since 2011 (Times Higher Education\npublished it before that). Furthermore, universities\npay attention to it and write self-congratulatory\npress releases when they fare well.\nFirst published in 2007, P&P\u2018s league table\ncollates data from university websites, and the\nHigher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) and\nturns it into 14 scores, each relating to a different\nindicator of a university\u2019s sustainability.\nThen,likemostleaguetables,itusesaweighted\nsum model to turn those scores into an overall\nrating. Each category is assigned a weighting,\nrelated to how much P&P feels it matters to a\nuniversity\u2019s overall sustainability. The 14 scores\nare multiplied by their respective weightings, and\nout pops a single number \u2013 the university\u2019s overall\nsustainability rating.\nComparing the weightings P&P has\nassigned for different categories is confusing.\n\u2018Environmental Policy and Strategy\u2019 is assigned\na weight of 0.04, while \u2018Ethical Careers and\nRecruitment\u2019 gets a weight of 0.03. It is unclear\nwhat exactly it is that merits the 0.01 difference.\nBut the real problems emerge when\ncomparing universities to one another \u2013 as P&P\ndoes implicitly when it ranks them \u2013 or when you\ntry, as we did here at Felix, to analyse a university\u2019s\nperformance over time.\nWe compared Imperial\u2019s scores this year to its\nscores last year (see chart below), and what we\nfound was puzzling.\nFor each category, the highest score possible\nis 100, and the lowest is 0. This year, Imperial\ndropped 10 points in the \u2018Education\u2019 category.\nWhy? Well, last year, Imperial scored 10 points\nfor \u2018providing academic staff with training on\neducation for sustainable development\u2019\n, and this\nyear, it has scored 0.\nWhy is this the case? It seems unlikely that\nImperial has all of a sudden stopped providing this\ntraining, and indeed, it has not. We understand\nthat the drop in score can be attributed to changes\nin how P&P assesses \u2018training\u2019 in this context.\nHowever, this methodology change has not been\npublicly reported.\nLet\u2019s take a look at another category, \u2018Auditing\nandEMS\u2019\n,whereImperialhasgained15pointsfrom\nlast year. Comparing year-on-year performance\nwould suggest that Imperial has, just this year\nstarted auditing the areas of \u2018Waste management\u2019\n,\n\u2018Energy\u2019\n, \u2018Water\u2019\n, and \u2018Emissions & Discharges\u2019\n.\nOnce again though, this is false. Imperial has\naudited these sectors for several years now, but\nP&P has only registered it this year.\nWe understand that universities are assessed\nfor the P&P league table by student volunteers\nover the course of a few weeks,. and that the\nstudents assessing the universities change year\non year.\nFelix went through every category for which\nImperial\u2019s score has changed (see chart) and\nfound that, in most cases, the reasons for\nchanges are driven by errors in the assessments\nundertaken this year or last year, or by changes to\nmethodology.\nWhich is to say, comparing performance\nyear upon year in this way is pointless, and\ncomparing universities using P&P\u2019s table is at\nbest challenging, and at worst impossible.\nWe wanted to use P&P\u2019s tables as an\nindependent, reliable tool to assess Imperial\u2019s\nperformance on sustainability, and to use the\nfigure shown here as a visual illustration of that.\nBut because of how the tables are compiled, that\nhas not been possible.\nTo be clear, we respect P&P for its creativity,\nin turning university rankings into a way to\nassess sustainability, but the concept has been\nimplemented poorly. To truly serve as a useful\nmeasure of the sustainability of UK universities,\nthe league table must assess institutions fairly and\nconsistently, and changes to methodology must\nbe reported clearly to the public.\nWhy People & Planet\u2019s\nleague table doesn\u2019t work\nEDITORIAL\nApology\nIssue 1837 horoscope\nA horoscope appearing in Issue 1837 played on the double meaning of the\nword \u2018strip\u2019 in \u2018Gaza Strip\u2019\n.\nWe, the Felix team, apologise sincerely for this. The horoscope in question\nwas inappropriate, insensitive and wholly unacceptable, and should not have\nbeen printed.\nWe are well aware of the horrific conditions faced by Gazans at present,\nhaving reported throughout last term on the ways in which the war in the Middle\nEast has affected members of the Imperial community.\nThe horoscope has been referred to Imperial College Union, who will conduct\na review, and help us ensure that similar content does not appear in the paper\nin future.\nWe have decided not to publish Catnip, the section in which the horoscope\nwas printed, while we await the Union\u2019s findings.\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please contact Imperial College\nUnion.\n+\nEnergy Sources\nAuditing & EMS\nHow has Imperial's People & Planet score changed?\n+ + + + +\nChange in People & Planet score, 2023/24 vs 2022/23\nEducation\nEngagement\nSustainable Food\nSource: Felix analysis of People & Planet University League scores for Imperial\nCollege London. 2022/23 scores obtained using Wayback Machine\nSustainability Staff\nEnvironmental Policy\nEthical Investment\nCarbon Reduction\nWorkers' Rights\nCarbon Management\nWater Reduction\nWaste & Recycling\nEthical Careers\nNote: Many of the year-on-year\nchanges apparent in this chart result\nfrom changes to People & Planet's\nmethodology, and oversights during\nthe implementation of that\nmethodology.

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n14 | Food&Travel 12 January 2024\nI\nt is around this season that I feel for my international\npeers that get three weeks off from university, without the means to travel home to their families. While\nEuropean and British students find a sub-\u00a3500 travel\nticket to the comfort of their hometowns, it is always\nimportant to remember that not everyone has been able\nto do the same. Regardless, I hope you all had a wonderful Christmas break. For this week\u2019s paper, spurred by\nmy curiosity about how Imperial students spend their\nwinter holidays, Felix sent out a survey. We received responses from seven students, whose stories I am about\nto regale you with.\nHere or yonder\nWith a mean age of 20.4 years, the respondents originated from Portugal, Hong Kong, the UK, Italy, India, Canada, France and Germany \u2013 and to no one\u2019s surprise, the\nmajority travelled back to their home countries for the\nwinter break.\nThe student from Hong Kong took advantage of Imperial\u2019s location in the UK and went to Hampshire, England rather than Hong Kong. The other seven respondents returned home.\nPrices, travel times and jet lag do not offer much in\nthe way of incentives for those who must travel long\ndistances to get home for the holidays. With the average ticket to travel across the Atlantic or across Europe\ntowards Asia costing thousands of pounds, and a minimum flight time of six hours with potential overlays, it\nis just not worth it.\nEuropean students on the other hand, look at flight\nprices from \u00a3200 to \u00a3600.\nTo rest or not to rest, that is the question\nThe two people that went skiing both went to Tyrol, Austria which is known for its beautiful alps,\napres-ski culture and endless kilometers of ski-slopes. Three respondees said they did nothing\nduring the holidays, one student studied diligently and one student for an Imperial hack-athon.\n\u2018Nothing\u2019 nowadays often means \u2018nothing useful\u2019 as if we expect every day to be a\nday of active fulfillment. Rest, sleep, and staring blankly up at the ceiling are all activities that\nrequire different levels of effort. It is often the case\nthat students feel they are doing \u2018nothing\u2019, when in re-ality, it is simply the case that their standards are too\nhigh. We all need a break at some point!\nTo return to the clan\nLuckily, most respondents used the time off campus to\nvisit their friends and family and to catch up. It is during\nthese times that you can meet at 11am for breakfast on\na random Wednesday \u2013 that you can meet with a friend\nwithout having to worry if your schedules align. Family\nmembers fly in from all around the world to celebrate\nbeing together.\nOther respondents met up with old friends in their\nhometown; basking in the memories of their old days\nin secondary school. One person attended a hockey\nmatch. Another watched as many movies as they could,\nand enjoyed the cinema.\nSadly, university did not release its stranglehold on\nall of our dear respondents. Three of the seven had to\nstudy for exams.\nThe Yule season brings celebration\nSix of the respondents celebrated Christmas, but only four\ncelebrated New Year\u2019s Eve. The December-January (Jule)\nseason brings with it the week between the 24th\nand\nthe31st\nwheretheworldstandsstill.Shopsinsome\nChristiancountriesclosefromthe25th\ntothe27th,\nto give tired workers a break after Christmas.\nThen come the 28th\n, 29th\n,and 30th\nand daily activities are few and far between. Time passes\nby without meaning and everyone awaits\nthe New Year. Some while away the final days of the break finishing their\nresolutions, while others stress\nabout finishing their work before the 31st deadline. One\nstudent spend the time\nwell to practice their\ndriving in their\nhome country and\ntry out the autobahn.\nExams?\nWhat better way to begin the new year than with\na season of exams and coursework deadlines. Though\nthe majority of my non-Imperial friends and family\nmembers call this \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201ctortorous\u201d, 71.4% of the\nrespondees voted to have exams after the break, rather\nthan at the end of the previous term. I am interested to\nhear other student\u00b4s opinion of this.\nWatch out for more surveys about the student body\non our Instagram page @felix_imperial.\nOh where hath\nthou been my dear\ncollege friends?\nLeaving 2023 behind,\nstudents embarked\nhome for three weeks\nto sleep, ski, and\nevidently, to study.\nrawpixel.com\nrawpixel.com\nFood&TravelEditor\nCHARLOTTE PROBSTEL\n\n"

Moody\u2019s\nAnalytics provides the tools that banks, insurers, and\nasset managers would use to effectively manage the risks\non their balance sheets. Our work spans the curation\nand cleansing of third-party data, using that data to\ncreate models and then building software to allow our\ncustomers to use the data and\nmodels in their business.\nIt is probably important from an Imperial perspective\nto know that there are a wide range of roles at Moody\u2019s;\nunderstanding credit is very important but there are\nmany other interesting and challenging roles. Only a few\nyears ago, we would have just thought about credit as the\nmain risk \u2013 maybe some of the other financial risks like\ninterest rate risk. Today we are talking about integrated\nrisk assessment. An organisation is obviously exposed to\ncredit, but it\u2019s exposed to a range of other risks \u2013 whether\nit\u2019scyber,ESG[Environmental,SocialandGovernance],or\nclimate. We\u2019re now starting to do the same data analytics\nandmodellingwhich wedidfor creditonthesenewrisks.\nAnd all these risks potentially have some relationship, so\nwe\u2019re doing some interesting correlation modelling.\nAs an example, in terms of climate change, we do a lot\nof work in looking at future climate scenarios and the\nimpact those scenarios will have on financial & other\nassets. We also look at the analytics around companies\ntransitioning to a net-zero world \u2013 whether it\u2019s carbon\ncredits, renewable electricity, or something else. We\nalso work on where companies should think about\nputting physical assets like a wind farm \u2013 what will the\nwind patterns be, is the area prone to earthquakes or\nhurricanes, and what that means for engineering.\nCan you give us a brief outline of your\njourney as a Maths student at Imperial to\nGeneral Manager of Moody\u2019s Analytics?\nI did Maths at Imperial. At that time if you studied Maths,\nyou ended up going into either accountancy or actuarial\nscience. I chose actuarial science and went to work for a\nlife company in Edinburgh, called Scottish Widows. Once\nIqualified,IrealisedIdidn\u2019twanttodoanyofthattechnical\nwork, so I instead spent the next 15-20 years doing\nbusiness-related roles at Scottish Widows \u2013 principally at\nthe customer end of the business. Somewhere in there,\nI did an MBA. I got to a fairly senior level, and when you\nget to that level there\u2019s a choice you make. Do you want\nto continue to climb one long and complex corporate\nladder, or do you want to do something else? I decided\nto leave my senior well-paid position and join what you\nmight call a startup today, called Barrie & Hibbert. This\nwas a very niche, technically focused modelling and\nsoftware business for life insurers. They were doing\nleading-edge maths for the evaluation of life insurance\ncompany guarantees. The founders wanted somebody to\nbuild a business, so I went there, and we successfully built\nthe business over five years as CEO. We then decided to\nsell the business and we were bought by Moody\u2019s in 2012.\nFrom 2012 onwards we integrated into Moody\u2019s. At some\npoint, my current boss wanted me to come to New York\nand help build what currently is Moody\u2019s Analytics into\na bigger business. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing since 2014.\nOver the last 10 years, we built a franchise for a thousand\ninsurance customers, generating hundreds of millions of\ndollars in revenue. We\u2019ve got a very extensive insurance\nanalytics business, which ranges from valuing complex\nderivatives for life insurers to complex hurricane and\nearthquake modelling. So that\u2019s how I got to where I got \u2013\nthere was a lot of luck along the way.\nHow has your time at Imperial helped\nyou in your current role?\nJustbeingatImperial\u2013thenamehelps.Thereisanatural\nassumption about who you are and what you do as an\nImperial graduate.

So,\nit seems relevant to discuss the recent\nCOP28 climate summit and the current\nstate of global commitments to environmental protection.\nCOP28 took place from 30th\nNovember\nto 13th\nDecember 2023 in Dubai, UAE. Two\nweeks of discussions between politicians\nand speeches from climate researchers\nand activists culminated in the \u2018UAE\nConsensus\u2019, a revised non-binding agreement on global climate commitments.\nOverall, COP28 is regarded as\nhaving been successful in decisively\nsetting a course for future action. The\nmost widely heralded outcome was the\nfirst-ever explicit mention of transitioning away from fossil fuels in a formal\nCOP outcome, which, at face value, signifies that world leaders are finally serious\nabout phasing out these carbon-emit-ting energy sources. On the first day of\nthe conference, the Loss and Damage\nfund was also officially enacted: money\ngenerated for this fund will support the\nnations that are currently most impacted by climate change, such as the effects\nof increased severe tropical\nstorms and heavy flood-ing.\nAdditionally, the\nparties discussed\ni n c r e a s i n g\nc l i m a t e\nfinance\na n d\nbuilding\ng r e a t e r\ntechnological\ncapacity for\nrenewable-energy\nsources such as wind\nand solar power. The conference also brought greater attention to the need to\nreduce methane emissions \u2013 which\nhave a much higher potential to influence global warming than CO2\ndoes \u2013 and\nto target industries that produce high\nlevels of greenhouse-gas emissions.\nIt has recently been announced that\nthe president of this year\u2019s COP29, which\nwill be hosted in Baku, Azerbaijan, is\nslated to be Mukhtar Babayev, a former\nexecutive of the State Oil Company of\nthe Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR), who\nis now the nation\u2019s Minister for Ecology and Natural Resources. This follows\nCOP28\u2019s appointment of Sultan Al-Jaber\nas its president, which was similarly\ncontroversial due to his ties to the Abu\nDhabi National Oil Company.\nThese might seem like surprising\nappointments on the surface, but in\ncountries such as the UAE and Azerbaijan, whose main exports are oil and gas,\nit makes sense that many of their most\npowerful political figures are linked to\nthe industry. Furthermore, these ties\nmight give them a better understanding\nthan other politicians of the relationship\nbetween such commodities and those\nbenefitting from them.\nSo, it is important that such\nstakeholders are kept in the\nconversation, instead of being pushed\nout; the real question is whether they\nshould be at the head of the table, in\ncharge of the decision making. It is unclear whether the explicit reference to\nphasing out fossil fuels in the UAE\nConsensus was\nincluded due to or in\nspite of Al-Jaber\u2019s presidency\nand the large number of attendees from\nbig oil corporations. However, it will\nonly be possible to see whether this kind\nof cooperation is beneficial to progress\nafter a few more COPs have been hosted\nin this manner \u2013 Azerbaijan will be only\nthe third major oil-exporting country to\nhost a COP conference. Brazil has also\nbeen chosen to host COP30 in 2025, and\nit will be interesting to see whether that\nwill lead to an increased focus on the impacts of rainforest deforestation and the\nimportance of carbon sinks in mitigating\nclimate change.\nAnother significant element of COP28\nwas completion of the first Global Stocktake. Originally proposed in the 2015 Paris Agreement, the stocktake is an assessment of the results of climate action so\nfar. In the stocktake, the UN Framework\nConvention on Climate Change (UN-FCCC) assesses the state of global action\nagainst climate change, and the ultimate\nconclusion of this was bleak. Earth\u2019s average global temperature is currently\nmore than 1.1\u00b0C higher than pre-indus-trial levels, less than 0.4\u00b0C away from the\nParis Agreement\u2019s critical temperature\nof 1.5\u00b0C. The world is currently on track\nto reach an average temperature of 2.42.6\u00b0C higher than pre-industrial levels by\n2100, which, although an improvement\non the original forecast of 3.7-4.8\u00b0C, will\nstill have devastating consequences for\nhumanity and wildlife. Perhaps this calls\nfor greater climate change adaptation\nmeasures on top of existing commitments to mitigate the issue.\nThe second Global Stocktake will be\ncarried out four years from now, so what\npolitical action might we see from nations in the coming years to avoid a similar outlook in 2028? Almost every country in the world has agreed to phase out\nfossil fuels, so implementing that will be\nhigh up on the global agenda. We might\nsee this in the form of more widespread\nincentives to switch to renewable energy\nand discouragement of oil- and gas-con-suming activities, such as petrol vehicles\nand gas burners and heating, as well as\naccelerated development and rollout of\ncarbon-capture technologies.\nThe UK is under\nincreasing pressure to\nfollow through on\ntheir cli- mate commitments:\nClientEarth is a non-profit organisation that has taken the\nUK government to court over\nits ineffective poli- cies several\ntimes in the past year. T h o u g h\nthe government\u2019s current net-ze-ro policies remain woe- fully\nunambitious, we can hope that\nother countries\u2019 net-zero goals\nhave put pressure on the UK\ngovernment to act. The benefits\nof restoring nature, both for combatting climate change and for biodiver-sity, was a major discussion topic for the\nUK at COP28 and will also be high up on\nits 2024 agenda. Ideally, we will see increased funding being directed towards\nlocal nature preservation and rewilding\nprojects in the future.\nThe climate crisis remains the most\npublicised environmental issue, but\nclimate-change mitigation is only one\npart of the wider goal to preserve Earth\u2019s\nnatural resources and aim for a future\nin which humanity is able to sustain itself without destroying the planet in the\nprocess. Although I could do a deep dive\ninto the climate-change figures for 2023\n\u2013 most notably the alarming red line of\naverage global temperatures illustrating\nthe world\u2019s hottest year since records\nbegan \u2013 this ignores other equally important aspects of the issue. Life can\u2019t be\nsimplified down to numbers in a dataset,\nor a problem with a single solution \u2013 it is\nreal organisms in real ecosystems, and\nit\u2019s crucial to maintain perspective about\nhumanity\u2019s place in this complex land-scape. In the years ahead, world leaders\nwould do well to be mindful of this fact\nand be proactive in the decisions they\nmake for their citizens.\nNew year,\nnew goals.\nWITH\nZANNA BUCKLAND\nWhat have the world\u2019s\nnations agreed to\nachieve on the\nclimate crisis\nfront?\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n8 | environment 12 january 2024\na lot of hard work. There\u2019s something intellectually\nchallenging about doing complex analyses at Imperial.\nMaths also teaches you that there is a structured way of\nsolving problems which helps you hugely, particularly in\nthe business I\u2019m in. Thirdly, Imperial students have got\na great grounding in how to translate complex things\ninto simple words. I was primarily at the customer end\nof Barrie & Hibbert, but being able to understand their\nhighly complex stochastic differential equations, and\ntranslate that into what a customer might think, is a\nhuge benefit.\nHow is climate change affecting\nfinancial products and services?\nOneofthechallengeswithclimatechangeforcompanies\nis that any financial impact is perceived to be too far in\nthe future. For most organisations, thinking five years\nout is a long time \u2013 even for financial institutions who\nhave longer time horizons, thinking about 2050 is a\nchallenge. So, you have this tension between knowing\nthe impact of climate change in 30-40 years but those\nimpacts not translating into substantial financial\nimpact today.\nThe way to think about this is not to focus just on\nthe future impacts of climate change, but what has\nand is happening now. You see everyday news stories\nabout more frequent and severe climate events \u2013 these\nimmediate risks are real and can have significant\nimplicationsforcompaniesaroundtheworld.Insurance\ncan help to mitigate these risks, but it is becoming\nincreasingly difficult for insurers to actually cover some\nof these risks \u2013 insuring properties in areas where there\nis increased risk of wildfire (California, for example) or\ninsuring properties from hurricanes or floods in Florida.\nHelping insurers model these risk more accurately\nso they can offer insurance is something we are very\nfocused on.\nClimate change is also having a material impact on\nmany business sectors other than insurance. The risk\nto physical assets is growing and insurers do not and\nmaybe cannot cover all of these risks. If you look at the\neconomiclossescausedbyclimateeventsinanyoneyear,\nonly about a third of the loses are covered by insurance;\nthe balance ends up being picked up by governments,\ncompanies and ultimately me and you. So not only\nare we building models and tools to help insurers,\nwe are also helping companies and governments to\nbetter understand the risks that they are retaining by\nessentially self insuring. Take a bank, lending money\nto companies to invest in a building in areas that are\nsignificantly at risk from hurricane or flood. It is getting\nmore difficult to insure these buildings, but for the bank\nthe building is the asset that is backing the loan should\nthe company default. If the building gets destroyed from\na climate event and the company defaults on the loan\nthen the bank has nothing. Our models and analytics\ncan help the bank identify and quantify this risk.\nCan Imperial students without finance\nbackgrounds who are passionate\nabout the environment get involved in\nMoody\u2019s Analytics?\nYes. The actual underlying financial analysis is not\nthat complicated \u2013 any student at Imperial has\nenough grounding in Maths to do pretty much\nanything in finance. There are certain jobs where we\nlook for technical skills if somebody wants to build\nfinancial models, hurricane models, or earthquake\nmodels. But generally, what is more important to\nme is the person themselves \u2013 particularly things\nlike intellectual curiosity and interpersonal skills. I\nwouldn\u2019t see Moody\u2019s as a financial services company.\nWe deal with financial things, but at the end of the\nday we are helping our customers with business risks\nand decisions. There are lots of opportunity hereyou\u2019ve got product management, marketing, business\nstrategy, and customer facing roles for the folks who\ndon\u2019t come from a finance background. In our graduate\nrecruitment programs, we tend to take up very broad\nrange of disciplines.\nIf you look at economic\nlosses caused by climate\nevents in any one year, only\nabout a third of the loses\nare covered by insurance;\nthe balance ends up being\npicked up by governments,\ncompanies and ultimately\nme and you.\n\u201c\nAndy Frepp, Imperial alumnus, and General Manager leading the Enterprise Risk Solutions business for Moody\u2019s Analytics.

It helps\nsoften the air filled with barking chihua-huas, family drama and those comments\nfrom your grandma that nobody asked\nher for, but that she nonetheless gifted\nto every grandchild that did not study\nmedicine.\nAll jokes aside, the eggnog was a\ndeliciousdessertthatmyfamilyand\nI devoured within days. We made\na very large batch (roughly 8L) to\nwhichaservingwasonly200ml.I\nthankmyAmericanfriendNicole\nfor having introduced it to me. It\nadded a little bit of the American\nspirit into Christmas that I did\nnot grow up with. I brought with\nme the traditional Christmas songs\nand dinner and she brough dessert.\nItisnicewhenculturescanintegratevia\nfood.\nWhether eggnog is food or not, is still up\nfor debate; it is rather a versatile drink. Soft\nand sweet, but also hot with alcohol, it can\nkicksomegoodspiritintotheevening.Weate\nit as a sort of mousse and it can be whipped\ninto many forms. Of course, after two weeks\ninthefridge,itwillturnintoliquid.\nI hope you try out this recipe and enjoy it\nas much as we did. It definetely helped with\ndogs...\nJesus turned water to wine, let\u2019s\nturn eggs into a devilish drink...\nFOOD&TRAVEL\nChristmas has ended, but holiday\nspirit lingers at the bottom of the\ndelicious eggnog that we recommend\nyou save for the next jolly season. Ingredients\n\u2022 1 dozen eggs - separated\n\u2022 1 scant cup sugar\n\u2022 1 quart whipping cream\n\u2022 1 oz 150 proof rum (needs to\nbe this strong to \u201ccook\u201d egg\nyolks)\n\u2022 1 fifth bourbon or rye whiskey\n\u2022 1 tsp vanilla\nInstructions\n1. Whip egg yolks until light and fluffy, then beat in sugar.\n2. Add rum slowly and stirring carefully to \u201ccook\u201d eggs.\n3. Add vanilla and 1/2 of bourbon or rye stirring in well. Beat cream\nstiff. Beat egg whites to stiff peaks.\n4. Pour egg yolk mixture into large bowl. Dump cream and egg\nwhites on top. Carefully fold cream and egg whites into yolk mixture while slowly adding remaining whiskey. This is a two person\njob!\nTips!\n1. Make a day before serving at the party but it can also be eaten/\ndrunk immediately! It may just be a bit foamy and thick. Always\nfold gently to remix.\n2. Top each serving with a sprinkle of nutmeg.\n3. To keep cold at a party, float a brick of very good quality vanilla ice\ncream on top.\n4. Also, I never used all the whiskey the second time as it becomes too\nstrong but it is up to your taste.\nDALLE.ai\nFoodWriter\nRHUMBARD RUMMY\n\n"

Ten, if you really want to skip on\nthe white space. What\u2019s the number? And a unit?\nMake it the classic: stars.\nAt Felix, it hasn\u2019t always been this way (look far\nenough through the archives and you will find those\nfamiliar stamps of approval). But since I started writing for the paper, there is a tendency to leave our\nopinions on the books populating our shelves and\ncoming through our inboxes in the mere paragraphs.\nAnd leave the numerical ratings aside.\nCall it editorial diligence (or the lack thereof) or\nthe frenzy of the Felix office before the Thursday print\ndeadline (the cats can get wild), but aptly giving star\nratings would be a hard part of the job \u2013 if it\u2019s done\nright. Many newspapers for example, The Guardian\nand The Times as notable examples, use stars to navigate the maze of film and music releases less con-troversially. When reviewing books, however, the\nlines can get a little blurred \u2013 at the time of writing,\nboth newspapers do not feature star ratings in their\nrespective Books sections. In many subtle ways, the\ngame changes. The number of factors influencing\nany given review is better likened to seasonal variations rather than a discrete list: dispositional changes across a reading period, coursework demands, the\nsignificance of that work in that moment in time, and\nof course, whether you\u2019re able to actually read it, as\nopposed to glazing over its contents in the hope that\nanything significant registers.\nIn the end, thoughts from hours of consumption\nmust be poured into the mold of an approximately\n500-word article, before then being further trimmed\nby the necessities of good editing. And so, the thought\nof throwing in a few stars might feel heartless. Or\nworse still, plain meaningless.\nIt goes without saying that stars are futile, without the context that a review would ideally convey\n(beyond being a vague indicator of quality). And\nwith book reviews, it can be especially difficult.\nThe idea of, say, three-and-a-half stars arguably\nworsens as the average time spent with the piece\nof media increases: from an album, to a movie, to a\nmedium-length novel. And the topic of what a book\u2019s\nintention was and is takes up a considerable slice\nof any conversation, more than its artistic merit or\nentertainment value.\nThe word m\u012bm\u0113sis, used by Aristotle in Poetics, describes the essential burden shouldered by many\nforms of good art: a human imitation or replication of\nthe many facets of life. The books we read hopefully\ntask themselves with this mandate, in however many\npages it takes to. And as reviewers, it follows that it\nwould be our job to properly evaluate how well they\nachieve this \u2013 if they indeed do.\nSo, if the stars aren\u2019t able to handle it, then our\nmonologues will have to manage.\nAn unfinished painting of Yemen Valley, Palestine, 1868.\nFrederic Edwin Church.\nIf you think you have a solution to this\nproblem, go ahead and email us at\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWe might even make it the Felix Books\nstandard (or at the least, get a good laugh).\nSubmissions are open till the\n29th of January 2024.\n(Multiple entries welcomed.)\nThe fault in our stars... well,\nat least here at Felix!\nBooksEditor\nFIYINFOLUWA T. OLADIPO\nBOOKS\nThe perennial problem of rating books, and how\nstars aren\u2019t quite so cut out for it.\nMinorDetailby\nAdianaShibli\nP\nalestinian writer Adiana Shibli\u2019s 2017 novella plays\non the idea of what it means to witness. Focusing\non the gang-rape and murder of a young Arab girl\nby Israeli militants during the Nakba, or War for Independence (the violent uprising leading to the displacement of 700,000 Palestinians from what is now Israel),\nand in its second half, the attempt of a young unnamed\nwoman to find her burial spot several decades later,\nMinor Detail is one of the most beautiful books I\u2019ve read\nin my life.\nThe word for martyr, shaheed is in fact the same as,\nand derived from, the word for witness, playing on the\nidea within Palestinian activism and art for the last 70\nyears of telling the horrors of the Nakba and occupation.\nThis idea features directly within the plot and the central themes of the novella, as its protagonist seeks not\nto right a 70-year wrong, but simply to see and witness a\nfootnote in history.\nIt\u2019s absolutely harrowing, brilliantly written by Shibli\n(and translated by Elisabeth Jaquette), and its elements\nof magical realism enhance the story to a feverish pitch,\nto highlight the tragic events based wholly in fact on a\ntrue story.\nPoignant tale of\nhistoric oppression\ncombined with magical\nrealist brilliance.\nBooksEditor\nMOHAMMAD MAJLISI\n\n"
