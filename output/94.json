Dear Sir,\nI regarded the front page photograph of the last issue\nof Felix with no small degree of suspicion.\nI noted in parti ou lar the whiteness of the banner wh i oh was exactly equalled by that of the un printed paper, the\nprinting on the banner which was characteristically small\nscale work, and finally the fact that the banner ran to the\nextreme edges of the arch leaving doubt as to how it was fast-e ned. Did this banner actually appear on the Beit Building or\nis a scheme afoot to precipitate us into war with Sir John\nCass who were blamed for the outrage?\nWith 'solitary* for hostel heretics and fudged, photographs the island site might be called the Island State.\nP.S. Tours truly,\nIEAeSS/ SELLARS.JON.\nThey always come for you in the night.\nCell (n+1)' Chelsea Police Station,\nJune 15th. Dear Sir,\nHaving recovered from celebrating the end of\nB. Sc. (Engineering) Examinations 1956, Part One, I was\nhappily reading the complimentary copy of \"FELIX\" sent\nto the establishment where I am Sp present residing,\nwhen, to my horror, I saw the above letter questioning\nthe accuracy of the reporting in \"FELIX\".\nAs a member of the dancing class in progress at\nthat time, I was a witness of the foul deed in question.\nIf the author of the above letter would care to\ncontact me in the bar, in, say, six month's time, on receipt\nof a pint of Worthington, I should be delighted to\nfurnish further details of this foul deed and the perpetrators thereof.\nTours Sincerely,\n1C TAe?6/750. cQ exe ke ls(9w im g Photographs on this page were taken by Messrs. Peacocks\n(R.C.S.) and Smith (C.&G.) These photographs show the polite intrusion of the\npolice to point out that Bo, as a power driven vehicle,\nshould not leave the road in the park, and that Jezebel\nas a commercial vehicle should not enter the park.\nDespite the retort that there was a fire in\nBayswater, the law insisted that\" a fire eng in t laden ed with thirty boisterous students would\nhave tc find some other way across the park.\nFIELD CUP RACE due cee& s FIELD CUP\nThe scene was like that in which the general gives a last\nminute explanation of his tactics to the troops prior to joining battle. This year's Field Cup task was being placed before\nthe engineers.\nEach department was to take a rope and then lower one\nof their number over the bridge across the Serpentine into a waiting beat. Then he was to be rowed to the chain marking\nthe end of the boating area where a very blunt knife would\nbe found. Having removed this warlike instrument the bearer\nwas next to be rowed to land beyond the boating station.\nAll he had to do then was to find a large balloon, (which, as\nD.T.\" s said \"-could be anywhere\".) filled with some lighter\nthan air gas - and release it. The winning department would\nbe that whose representative was first to release a balloon.\nMuch to their surprise, the Guildmen were able to leave\ncollege without interruption from the Police and the official,\ncrews were lowered over the bridge without incident. Although\nit was inevitable that some people should \"fall\" into the\nSerpentine during the subsequent fighting whilst the rao e was\nin progress, the actual race was comparatively orderly. Only\nthe Aero Department Inst their ship. Hie Electrical Department\nwere the eventual winners.\nUnfortunately whilst the race had gc tt s s almost unobserved\nby the \"men in blue\", Bo had attracted some official attention\nWhy was the car parked behind *he boating station? - This was\nnot a public high v/ay j While Bo was interviewing the police\nwho were being told more and more tall stories, the crowd was\nnot idle. The policeman's bicycle was being passed back\nthrough the crowd and it is reported that it was eventually\nhoused in a tree.\nWhen the dispute had been settled it was unanimously\nde oid ed that the balloon, on the end of a sixty-foot length\nof string, should be carried back to Guild3 in Bo escorted by\nthe still-jubilant engineers. The route was through the park\ntowards Hyde Park Corner until Rutland Gate, though which\nBo turned into the main road., and came back to Guild's via\nKnightsbridge and Exhibition Road. \u00ab\n_\nAn excellent tr rf fic jam resulted as might well be imagined. The safe oar ri age of the balloon presented its own\ndifficulties. Lamp-posts had to be passed and long branches\non trees avoided as the prevailing wind carried the balloon\ntowards these obstacles. Only one lamp-post caused any\nconcern, however, the string got o aught in the joint between\nthe vertical column and the act xi al arm carrying the lamp.\nBo was just stopped in time to prevent the balloon exploding\nand the problem of releasing the string was soon solved after\nBo had been reversed. Reversal of Bo, however, entailed\nreversal of the student mob and of the traffic behind it. The law became interested,but the journey continued with an\nescort of two police outriders.\nAs spirits we:, e still high when the engineers returned\nto Guild's, a Boomalaka and some fun was had at the expense\nof R.C.S. On their eventual return to Guilds, the day ended\nwith a speech of thanks to the \"men in blue\" who this year\nhad been very kind.\n\n"

It\nis two feet too short for a standard badminton o our t, and\nnetball and basketball will be limited.\nSince there is an adequate gym. at the U.L. U. building\nwhere some of our athletes train at present^ the size\nshould not worry.those wishing to participate in sport at\nSouth Kensington,\nThe I.C. gymnasium was never intended to be perfect\ndue to size limitation, though an extra two feet in length\ncould have been found if te Badminton Club Offioers of\npast years had been more alert.\nA similar occurrence at the U.L.

We had a glorious afternoon for the battle at Hurlingham,\nand reinforcements of ice-lollies were In constant supply.\nThe real surprise of the fixture occurred in the 880\nyards. Maureen Hawes was our first runner, but there was\nsome doubt as to whether any other member of the I.C. W.S.C. team oo ul d survive such a distance. However, keeping to the\nold .I. C.W.

The rebuilding of the\nUnion premises is now nearing completion,and this should result\nin the easing of the burden of the students as far as Union\nfacilities are o on cern ed. The year began with the arrival at the College of the\nlargest number of Freshmen the ..College has yet seen, and I hope\nthat the two Freshers' Days provided something of an,introduction\nto the Union. Whilst on the subject of Freshers Reoeptions I would like to say something of our Overseas Students. In the\npast a special function has been arranged for students from\nabroad but for one reason or another they have not been suo>\no ess ful. Next terra I believe all three Constituent Colleges\nare going to hold Freshers' Dinners, and each Freshman, including Overseas Prso.h men will have an \"Old Lag\" as his host.\nThis method lays the onus on the Old Lags, and I would point\nout that all of you will be Old Lags next year, With your\nsupport and cooperation a new approach can be made to Ove: is as students to get them to' join in our activities.\nOne of the best attended functions of the year was L mem. Day, held for the first time in the Royal Albert Hall.\nThis ceremony affects us all sooner or later- later for some\nthan others- and it was gratifying to see it well supported.\nMay it long be as successful as this year. The Com mem Ball\nheld in the Dorchester Hotel could have been better attended,\nbut those who did go along had an enjoyable evening. To try\nand attract more graduates who hove been presented at Comraem.\nDay it has been decided to hold the two functions on the same\nday. I hope that when u ou have been presented with your degrees\nyou will grace the Ball with your attendance.\nBecause of the many edicts\nwhich have been served upon us by ,0 < , S/<< Ld&m&6Mm, the University Senate it would ap^ I pear that our Nov, 5th. celebrations I have been permanently banished to J Harlington. This , to my mind, is a I good thing because when large num- lber s of students gather together in I Town they seem to go berserk at the I sight of students from other. Colleges j At Harlington there are always the |\nfew irresponsible types.who thought- |\nless ly scatter broken glass over the\nplaying field and throw fireworks at\nindividuals. If these people could ]\nbo eliminated there would be few\ngrounds for complaint for holding\nour celebrations at Harlington.\nThe Athletic and Social a ot iv i ties will be highlighted by their\nrespective Chairmen, but I would like to mention Morphy Day\n. and Sports Day. These were both successful occasions b\"t attendance was extremely poor considering there is a..oU. f holiday for each function.\nThe one bright spot on the question of matt end a noes has\nbeen the increase in-popularity of Hall Dinner. This is an\nencouraging sign since as well as providing an opportunity for\nhaving an excellent meal quite cheaply it enhances the Staffstudent relationship wh i oh cannot but pro duo e goodwill amongst\nall.o ono er ned. At one of the best attended Union Meetings for some year*\nthe Union has again rejected a proposal to rejoin N.U.S. This\nsubject seems to come up annually and I would like to reaffirm\nwhat was stated in the Presidents Report for 1947-48:- It must be obvious by now that the Imperial College Union and to\nthat extent the constituent College Unions would do far better\nif all the time an. energy spent digging up this subject every\nyear 'were direct into more profitable channels such as\ninternal matters .\n' the College.\nIn the Into national field the Union re oie ved two invitations to oen fer; es in Genpany. I had the good fortune to attend\none and Mr Kitoheoer the other. From the reports that have\nappeared in FELIX it should now be clear that I.C.'s reputation\nis high amongst most of the Technical Universities in Europe.\nThis International goodwill and cooperation o an be achieved by\nthis Union without having cause to join N.U.S. Nationally, the Union was also represented at the Universities Conference at Southampton where full discussions were\nheld on domestic matters. The success of the conference appears\nto have been its informality and lack of debating trio ks and\npoints of order'.\nWith the New Union Building constantly in their minds,\nCouncil have done their utmost to see that it will be opened\nin October. Fortunately I can say that there is every indication\nthat this will be so, although the gymnasium and top d^ lng .\nhall might not be fully completed by Oct. 1st. the rest of ths\nbuilding will. The Union Decoration Committee is now making its\nfinal decisions.and I should like to express my thanks to\nMr A. V.S. de Reuok for the enormous amount of work he has don*\non this Committee.\nIn conclusion may I thank the Union Officers for the ass:\nis tsn oe they have given me a throughout the year. My especial\nthanks to Mr Kitchener in the onerous position of Seoretary.\nHis ev or helpful hand could always be railed upon to give the\nnecessary support.\nFinally thank you all for making my year of off ioe an\nenjoyable one and I wish you all the very bast of success\nin ths future.\n\n"

And although many of\nus leave vowing to give up our subject in favour\nof advertising, administration or-something guaranteed to make money, those who actually achieve\nthis breakaway are quite few.\nSince the atmosphere of this college is far\nfr3\" cloistered, the great world outside is no\nsho c'c to the ex-I.C. technologist - or even to\nthe scientist though he may tend to be a more shy,\nretiring creature. You will exchange your digs\nin London for digs or a flat in some other town\nor country r. ore or less exotic, (j ix tre a e cases\nnever get away from S.W.7 \u00bbnd spend their time\nco ning to hops and pretending that they have nt left at all.) You'll find your working colleagues\nmuch the sans as the people here. They may even be\nthe sane people, as wherever you g.o, you'll find\nso ie one fro? I.C, already there. Your manager\nwill appear brighter than.your late research sup-er visor, and your equipment will, with any luck,\nbe shinier than the antiquated apparatus owned by\nmany of the departments here. Your assistant,\nstudying for his H. N.C. in the evenings, may make\nyou feel you did things the easy way; the types\nin the workshop will inevitably talk about the\n'telly' all day long; the can te:n will be no better\nthan Mooney's Caff. How will you know you've left?\nThe difference is, of course, the salary\ncheque at the end of the month. *t first, it's pleasant to feel more affluent than before and\nthere seem to be no strings attached, But as tha\nmonths go by, a change of heart occurs in the working ex-student. He realises that by virtue of fh fcs slip of paper he has become an ordinary men ber of the\ncommunity, he realises that his years at college,\nhowever enjoyable, were years of waiting and un-certainty. Ke realises that now the broad outline\nof his life is settled and that must put down\nhis roots and begin to live along ths lines laid\ndown, rte actions to this vary as tl uch as human\npersonalities; but at the risk of seeming pompous\none can say that at this; point, irresponsible youth\nis over.\nEXPLORATION PROJECT:\n'H cr wu if,( Summer, 1956\njj ave Bridgeivater's expedition to Norway, one\nof the first ventures sponsored by the I.C. Bxploratlon board, show3 promise of being a successful\none from every point of view. It will leave London\non June 25th, for a small icecap, known as the\nAltotbreon, situated in rocky mountainous country\nabout 100 miles North of Bergen. The published\nobject? of the expedition are: firstly, to study\nthe geology of the area, and secondly to investigate the actual glacier, this last work being done\nby the two gla cio logi sts j jd. Langham and John\nHallat, who are normally to be found in the Huxley\nBuilding doing curious things with small clouds,\nwhich they photograph, and crystals of ice, which\nare inspected through polaroid s. The other members\nof the expedition are: Dave Bridgewater himself,\nUraham he es, Bob Tate, and ie ter Kassler, all geologists from K.C. S., Brian Lavers from Mines, and\nJim Aitcheson of Guilds.\nThose who can visualise the combination of *\ngeologists, a Miner, and engineer and two gla cio l0,l ts - not normally a dry occupation in itself\",\nwill find it difficult/ to imagine how they will survive for two months on an icecap which 1\" some\ndistance from the nearest supply of hard 1.-^u or. They might be even more perplexed were they to see\nthe diet Dave has prepared for the party, fa are\nassured that those who have belts will have to\ntighten them - the only/consolation being that\nthis will hit the leader as hard as any of us.\nThe expedition includes a number of enthusiastic photographers, and a cine camera is being\ntaken, to provide a permanent record of our visit. Humour has it that some of us may even appear on\n1. T.A.;ifa sound track is made, it is hoped, that\nthis can be cleaned up before any public showings\nof the film. - Some of us are hoping to carry out\nsome subsidiary studies: it was unfortunately found\nimpossible to include any biologists In the party,\nbut many of us will be investigating the behaviour\nof the tamed giant horsefly of these'regions - when\ngorged with human blood. One of us who has extensive agricultural interests intends to make a survey of the technique of Norwegian milkmaids, which,\nwe are told, is far in advance of that of their\nEnglish counterparts.\nThree of those who will be going are members\nof the I.C. Mountaineering Club, and will undoubtedly make attempts on a number of h.. her to unconquered rock faces - they have also been perfecting\nthe technique of Irussic slinging as a means of\nabstracting gla cio logi sts from crevasses in glaciers - the method may be a little slow, and even\ninconvenient, but is very effective - especially\nwhen supplemented by a quart of the best at the\ntop of the crevasse.\nWe return from Altotbreen on August the 21st. and having drunk Bergen dry, we depart for Newcastle on the good ship S. S. Venus - which, we under-stand, provides as diverting and pleasant Journey\nas any that sails on the high seas.\nIn conclusion it is only fair to say that I.C. Exploration Board has provided a tremendous amount\nof assistance to the expedition - both financial\nand moral, without which it could never have been\npossible in its present form.\nPeter Kassler,\nPublic Relations Officer,\nI.C.

Five times\nas many students attend any dance in Imperial College as\nattend any other function. Battersea Polytechnic , which is\nlees than half the size of I.e., has a hall that takes 700.\nNext tern, this College will have to run da noes in a hall\nwh i oh will hold 300. Students may however wander between\nrival establishments, such as Queen Alexandra House, where\nBedford College have s esn a chance to exploit the shortage\nof eV-ur day night ac como dati on in South Kensington.\nWith this as the final issue this session, and my last\nissue, I would like to express my thanks to all the readers\nwhose threepences have kept us solvent, and to all the\ncontributors who have provided material for us to publish.\nI thank particularly the staff of FELIX who have done sc\nmuch work:\nEdith Stephen, John Bramley, John Dearden, Chris Farrow,\nPete Levin, Dave Marshall on the editorial side,\nElisabeth Kranok and Fete Ling on production,\nPat Billingham, Pete Southgate and Bill Thornley as\nartists,\nRuth Billington, John Nioholls, Ian Flummer and Mike\nRutter on the business side of the paper.\nThe next Editor will start with a ole an slate. He will\nalmost oe rta in ly have a new style of FELIX, which will be\nlarger and have more pages. Reduction in printing will be\nunnecessary, so it should be o leaner and dearer. It may\nbe a new era in the life of FELIX and I wish him every\nsuo o ess with it. IMPERIAL COLLEGE CHRISTIAN UNION.\nIn November from 4th. to 11th., a Mission will be conducted throughout London University by the London Inter-Faculty\nChristian Union. At Imperial College, the Mission will be\norganised by I.C.C. U., under the title, \"What think ye of\nChrist?\" It will be led by Mr Miohael Griffiths B.A. During this week, there will be a special series of\nmeetings, in the lunch hour and after College, whose aim will\nbe to consider and present the claims and person of Jesus\nChrist, in a fair and straightforward manner.\nFurther details will be circulated and an noun oed next\nterm. s>..*: BUSY TIMES AHEAD\nBarriers have been erected round the portion of the\nImperial Institute Galleries that are now being demolished.\nThese will no doubt, be useful to hold back the public when*\nwork stops owing to the discovery of Roman remains which must,\nas ever the whole of the Greater London,- lie in the eu be oil.

It is to be hoped that something will be found that will indicate that the site was used to further the arts and\nscience* (kul ture) long before Prince Albert thought of his\n\u2022ester-plan.

His research shows that the oh i ef onuses of students' anxieties are homesickness and the\nfinal exams.\nWhatever his findings , Dr. Logan's attempts in thin\nfield are moat welcome. The intensity of complexes ant\nneuroses, and the number of mental breakdowns amongst students is as high as, if not higher than, the average, yet\nserious attempts to understand the peyo ho logi o al troubles\nof students are few and far \"between.

We appreciate that the traditional approach\nof ps yoo an aly sia has >< s to investigate extreme neuro tio oases, and we cannot for that reason hope to be ae of\nmuch interest as homosexuals and delinquents, but in a world in wh i oh brain work is becoming increasingly important for production, psychologists have mu oh to offer the\nworld by analysing the problems of brain-workers, and these\nproblems are by no means divorced from those of the University. Apart from this, it is high time that student\nproblems were looked squarely in the face, if only for the\nsake of the University itself.\n( Editorial Note: Nelson had an awful hangover , from a week's poet-examination drinking, when he wrote the above\nparagraph.
