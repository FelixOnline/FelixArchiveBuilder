The smell of tobacco on\nclothes or breath is unpleasant to non-smokers. Smoking has an ageing effect.\nHeart disease and lung cancer are now\nserious problems amongst women smokers as well as men who die\nprematurely.\nMost adults (two thirds) do not smoke\nand two thirds of smokers would like to\nstop. So most people evidently consider\nsmoking undesirable. If you smoke and\nevidently can't give up, does it lessen\nyour credibility to be in authority over\nother people?\nTobacco is a legal product. The legal\nright to sell tobacco to over 16's is\nunquestioned. What is questionable is the\nmorality. Would any socially-responsible\nperson promote and advertise a dangerous product on which its victims\nbecome 'hooked', knowing, moreover,\nthat most are hooked when they are\nyoung and impressionable and have not\nreached the legal purchasing age?\nThe argument is however, that if\neveryone stopped smoking a lot of people\nwould be out of a job.

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFelix presents the details of a new dev elopement in research at Imperial\nQuadspace: Found\nOn Monday this week, the Space-Time\nInterdisciplinary Research Centre (IRC) at\nImperial College announced that a ground-breaking new paper is to be\npublished in the near future. The paper\ndetails a radical new area of dimensional\nresearch and is titled 'Quadracyclic\nDimensional Anomalies and their effects\non the Space Time Continuum'. It was\nwritten by two independent researchers\nworking at the IRC, J Briant and A Butcher. The pair have been working on\nthe concepts outlined in the paper for\nmost of their lives and met at Imperial\nCollege.\nThe research began several years ago\nwhen Briant and Butcher, quite\nindependently at the time, became\nfascinated by the number of times objects\napparently disappeared without a trace,\nonly to be found again later with no\ndifficulty. However, it was not until they\nmet at Imperial that the vague theories\nthat both had coalesced into the current\nresearch. To explain: how many times\nhave you 'lost' an object, searched\nthoroughly for it and not been able to\ndiscover its whereabouts, only to discover\nit, after a period of time, with relative\nease? Probably hundreds, yet few people\nhave ever stopped to question this\nphenomena. This week Felix is able to\nbring you an exclusive preview to the\npaper, written by the researchers\nthemselves.\nQuadracyclic Dimensional Anomalies and their effects on\nthe Space Time Continuum\u2014an overview\nBefore beginning this discussion of\nquadra cyclic dimensional anomalies, and\nin order to simplify the following\nconcepts, it would be advisable for us to\nexplain some of the terms which are\ncommonly used in conjunction with this\nresearch. 'Quadspace' is used to refer to\nthe whereabouts of an object that has\nbeen the focal point of an anomaly. Thus\nan object is referred to as being 'in\nquad space' and when an object enters\nquad space, it is said to have been\n'quad spaced'. Furthermore, the point at\nwhich a quad spaced object returns to real\nspace is termed the 'exit point'.\nThe research into quad space has\nprogressed slowly, owing both to a lack\nof funding, and the inherent difficulty of\nthe work. By its very nature, quad space is extremely difficult to investigate, and is\na perfect example of various uncertainty\nprinciples; when actually looking for a quad space anomaly one almost never\noccurs, yet when your back is turned, so\nto speak (sometimes quite literally), one\noccurs. Despite these problems, however,\nwe have managed to make some\nprogress, which we shall attempt to\nexplain herein.\nWhile initially all aspects of quad space effects appeared to be random, after\nsome investigation, and the application of\nmodern chaos theory, it was found that\ncertain patterns existed, and certain\nprinciples appeared to be acting.\nWe shall start by examining the\nobservations and hypotheses that have\nbeen arrived at relating to quad space effects, and then continue by discussing\nthe theories that we have proposed to\nexplain these effects.\nAny object can be quad spaced, with the\ntransition of an object at the focal point\nof an anomaly from real space into\nquad space appearing to be instantaneous.\nHowever, certain objects appear to have\nan increased likelihood of being at the\nfocal point of an anomaly. Some appear\nto have an inherently higher probability\nassociated with them, but those of a small\nphysical size, and/or large level of\n'importance' have been shown to possess\na much higher probability of becoming\nquad spaced. It is the second of these criteria that\nhas caused the largest amount of\ncontroversy in this research. The\nimplication that the human brain's perception of the need for an object at\nany given time can in some way affect\nthe physical properties of the said object\nwithin the space time continuum is\nnothing short of revolutionary. It has led\nare poorly understood and often based\nmainly on obscure and complicated\nmathematics that are beyond the scope of\nthis article.\nObviously, the SPLIF value of a given\nobject will vary with time. It appears that\nthe rate of increase of an object's SPLIF\nvalue also has an affect on the probability\nof the object being quad spaced. Thus if\nan object suddenly becomes important,\nthe chances of it being quad spaced also\nA Bic bir o to the definition of a new property of\nmatter, the Specific Perceived Level of\nImportance Field, or SPLIF. The SPLIF is\nthe level of the value of or need for a given object at a given time as perceived\nby a given person. Items that typically\nhave a high SPLIF value include such\nI things as keys, writing implements,\ncheque books, credit cards,\ncontraceptives, cigarettes, matches or\nlighters, and scraps of paper with phone\nnumbers or lab results written on them.\nThus, at a given time t increase, apparently in a loose\nexponential relation. This explains the so\ncalled 'safe place' phenomenon: when an\nobject is stored in a safe place and then,\nafter a period of uselessness, becomes\nneeded quickly, it has suffered a quad space anomaly. Examples are sports\nequipment stored out of season, and\nimportant but little-used documents (birth\ncertificates, etc).\nThus at a given time tp( quad)* 1\np( quad) x/ dSP Ll FV UJ and\nV object\np( quad) SPLIF(\nobject\nWhere p( quad) = the probability of the\nobject entering quad space sPL IF, volume of the object\nobi ect= SPLIF value of object at\nthat time.\nIt should be noted with these and any\nfollowing formulae that they are very\ninaccurate approximations of very\ncomplicated relationships, many of which\nIn addition to this there also appear to\nbe areas where quad space activity is\nabnormally high. Investigation of these\n'Quadzones' has led to the theories of\nSPLIF value addition and quad zones. A quad zone is an area of real space that\nhas a high level quad space activity. The\nonly explanations for this involve some\nvery high level mathematics which are\nbeyond the scope of this article.\nHowever, the principle behind SPLIF\nvalue addition is more within the scope of\nthis discussion. In an area where there is\na high proportion of objects with high\nSPLIF values, they appear to create a combined effect that is larger than the\n10\n)liege\nOne Dimension\nsum of their values.\nThus, in a given area\np( quad)\u00abQfS PLIFo bj ect5 y where n= number of objects\nOnce an object has been quad spaced,* the amount of time spent in quad space is\nlargely random. However, in common with other aspects of quad space phenomena, there do seem to be some\nunderlying principles. The amount of time\nan object spends in quad space is\napparently proportional both to the\namount of time spent searching for the\nobject, and the level of the SPLIF value\nfor the object as it changes with time.\nThus\nand\nt Kt\nquad search\nt quad \u00ab . ( d SPL IF/ dt)2 Where t( quad) = time spent in\nquad space t( search) = time spent searching\nall objects in real space exist in four\ndimensions. If one imagines that the\nspace-time in a localised area 'twists' or\nrotates around these axes, then the t axis\nwould, for example become the x axis,\nthe x axis would translate to the y axis,\nand so on. Thus to an observer outside\nthe area of this Rotationally Operative\nAnomaly Centre Hysteresis, or ROACH, an object at the focal point of the\n'twisting' would vanish.\nIt seems, however, that space time has\na resistance to this effect, akin to a level\nof elasticity. While a ROACH can occur\ngiven the right conditions, it can only\nexist for a short time before space time\nreverts to its previous state, and any\nobject caught at the focal point of the\nROACH returns to real space. However,\ndue to the translational effect of the\ntwisting, and the relative movement of\nthe object's original position over the\nperiod of the ROACH quad space effect\nthe exit point of the object from it will\noften be at a different position in real\nspace than that at which it initially held.\nAs discussed above, it appears that the\nprobability of a ROACH occurring is\nQuad Space in action\nThe exit point, of a quad spaced object,\nin common with the time spent in\nquad space, is totally unpredictable by any\ncurrent scientific means. Paranormal\ntechniques have also proved unsuccessful\nto this point. However, also in common with other aspects of quad space, there do\nseem to be some basic laws. Quadspaced\nobjects never exit to a point currently\nunder observation by any known method.\nThe exit of an object from quad space appears to be instantaneous. Also, it is\nentirely possible for a quad spaced object\nto exit to a point that was clearly in view\nor had been searched several times\nduring the course of attempting to find\nthe object. This has occurred in several\ncase, as has the occurrence of the exit\npoint in some place that said object could\nnot have reached by any other means. It\nwas the combination of these two factors\nthat lead to much of the early research\ninto quad space. There have been several hypotheses\nsuggested to explain the underlying\nprinciples behind and the nature of\nquad space. All have been investigated,\nand there are two that appear to be the\nmost correct.\nThe first revolves around the theory of\ndimensional 'twisting'. To put this simply,\naffected by various conditions, including\nthe SPLIF. The resistance of space time to\nthe twisting would appear to increase\nwith the volume of real space involved,\nexplaining the relation of p( quad) to'the\nvolume of the object. It has been\ntheorised that there exists a ROACH potential, which can be visualise d as a form of potential energy. When the\nROACH potential reaches a certain level\na ROACH can occur, or can continue to\nexist. The higher the potential above this\npoint the higher the probability of the\neffect occurring or continuing. Once the\npotential drops below a certain level\nspace time reverts to its previous state.\nUnfortunately, no acceptable scale or\nmeans of measuring the potential at a given point has been discovered to date.\nIt can be inferred, however, that most of\nthe observed relationships discussed\nabove relate to this ROACH potential,\nand when the various conditions exist at\ncertain levels the probability of a ROACH quad space event occurring is increased.\nThe second hypothesis deals with the\nconsideration of quad space existing in a separate sense to the continuum in which\nwe exist, as opposed to the above view,\nwherein quad space is seen to be a characteristic of real space.\nThe universe is apparently infinite within\nthe four common dimensions. However, it\nis possible that other 'universes' exist in\nparallel to it, utilising others. Quadspace\nmay be such a parallel. If this is true then\nseveral observations can be arrived at as\nto its nature. Most importantly quad space is obviously closely associated with our\nuniverse. It is this that allows quad space effects to occur, when an object from real\nspace enters or leaves quad space. The\nnature of this travel is a matter of some\ndiscussion and conjecture, but the most\nlikely means are based on an obscure\nbranch of geometrical mathematics,\nwhich can be used to show a process by which objects could enter or leave an\narea such as quad space. The key\nequations, whose complexity precludes a detailed analysis here, combine to form\nthe Dual Optimised Permissibility\nExpression, or DOPE. This process is best imagined as an\noverlapping of real space and quad space, and then the formation of a temporary\nlink between them, caused by specific\ncircumstances. The Extrapolation of the\nDOPE also leads to some other inferences\nabout quad space and related events. The\nDOPE clearly shows that the probability\nof the link occurring is related to the size\nof the focal area of the link, with smaller\nfocal areas much more likely than large\nones. Once again this explains the\nrelation between p( quad) and V object. It\nwould appear likely that quad space is not\ninfinite in the same way as this universe,\nor at least does not have the same\ninfinite capacity for objects from real\nspace. Thus the higher the total volume\nof real space objects in quad space, the\nless chance of another one entering\nduring a link, and the more chance of\none returning to real space.\nIt also appears that real space objects\nhave a low affinity for quad space, but this\naffinity may be altered by certain\nconditions, and varies with certain\nproperties of the object, such as its\ncurrent SPLIF value. Thus an objects\naffinity for quad space may be raised to\nthe point where it can exist there, by\nincreases in factors such as the objects\nSPLIF or by the combined SPLIF values\nof objects near to it in real space (see the\nequations above). However, if these\nfactors then change, the objects affinity\nfor quad space may drop below a critical\nlevel. At this point the objects foreign\nnature will cause it to be expelled from\nquad space at the next link. The reason\nwhy objects tend to be expelled in an\narea close to that where the initial link\nformed are not known at this point.\nWe would like to thank all those who\nhave helped us with this research, and to\nextend this thanks to IC itself, for\nallowing us the facilities we needed.\n11\n\n"

    "content": "by drowning, 10 by severe injuries or\nburns. The cause of death of the\nremaining 4 has not been established.\nIn trying to establish the cause of the\ndisaster, considerable difficulties were\nencountered because so little physical\nevidence remained and there were so few\nsurvivors who could give essential\ninformation. (Although 61 men survived,\nnone was a senior member of Piper's management team). A large number (in\nexcess of 30) possible causes were\nadvanced. Relatively few of these could\nbe conclusively discounted but many of\nthem were extremely improbable,\nrequiring several successive improbable\nevents to have occurred. The most\nprobable original cause almost certainly\nlay in the condensate separation and\ninjection area.\nCondensate was separated from the gas\nin a large vessel (see Figure 2) and then\npassed to two pumps operating in parallel\nfor injection into the oil export line, as\nshown in Figure 4. On the evening of\nJuly 6 1988, pump A was isolated for\nmaintenance of its motor drive coupling.\nIn addition, its safety valve was removed\nfor maintenance and a blind flange\nalmost certainly fitted in its place. The\nflange was not, however, pressure-tested.\nWhen pump B tripped at about 21.45, the\noperators would initially have sought to\nrestart it. They were not successful in this\nendeavour. Unless they could resume\nflow of condensate, they would\neventually have had to halt production on\nPiper. This is because the condensate\nseparation vessel would in the end have\nfilled with liquid, which would then have\nbeen passed to the final-stage gas\ncompressors. The compressors would then\nhave tripped, automatically shutting down the gas plant and eventually all of the\nproduction.\nSince the operators could not restart\npump B, the question arises: what else\ncould they do? The evidence suggests\nthat what they in fact did was try to\nrestart pump A. They would have been\naware that pump A was out of\ncommission for maintenance\u2014but that\nmaintenance had not yet started. Because\nof the way in which work permits were\norganised on Piper, it seems almost\ncertain that they would not have been\naware that the safety valve for pump A was missing. Moreover, they would not\nhave been able to see that it was missing\nsince the valve in question was one floor\nabove the pumps that they were\noperating (remember that gas and\ncondensate processing was an\nafterthought on Piper: items of equipment\nwere placed where they could be, not\nwhere they ideally might be). Thus they\nprobably took steps to reinstate pump A, one step of which would have been to\nrepress u rise it. The most probably thing\nthat happened next is that the\ncondensate, after flowing extremely\nrapidly into the pump and then into its\nsafety valve line, leaked at the blind\nflange fitted in place of the safety valve.\nThe evidence of the sequence of gas\nalarms noted by the surviving control\nroom operator and the strength of the\ninitial explosion suggests that the leakage\nhole and an area of about 40 mm2. The\nline leading to the blind flag e was a nominal 4 inch pipe, so that 40 mm2 corresponds to lifting of the flange by\nonly 0.1 millimetres. Thus the leakage\ngap need only have been very small and\nwould have been consistent with an\nincompletely tightened flange. Perhaps 80\nkilogrammes of condensate would have\nescaped over a period of order 1 minute.\nThis found a source of ignition (which is\nunknown\u2014but irrelevant: an inflammable\nmaterial will generally find an ignition\nsource) and led to the first explosion. This\nled to the initial fires and then to the\nsequential failure of the gas lines which\ncaused the horrifying ly rapid escalation of\nthe disaster.\nHow could this have happened so easily?\nClearly, there were several failures,\namongst which were the following:\n\u2022 There was a questionable work permit\nsystem. Maintenance work on the safety\nvalve of the condensate pump was\nconducted only during the day, so the\nwork permit was suspended\u2014and not\ndisplayed in the control room\u2014overnight.\nOperators were thus unaware of the\nremoval of the valve.\n\u2022 There was questionable plant isolation.\nCondensate pump A was isolated only by\nclosure of its air-operated suction and\ndischarge valves (see Figure 4). There\nwas no mechanical isolation and the\nvalves were not locked shut. Thus the\noperators, unaware of the removal of the\nsafety valve, were able to reintroduce\nhigh pressure hydrocarbons into a line,\nthe integrity of which could not be\nguaranteed.\n\u2022 There was questionable design. Gas and\ncondensate processing was undertaken\nST FERGUS MCP-01 FRIGG\nCLAYMORE TARTAN Figure 3\n25\n\n"

This is\na question that a lot of people ignore,\ndespite knowing the answer. They have,\nin some cases, known for years that\nLondon is not a particularly safe place to\nbe on a bike, and yet they apparently\naccept this. Why? The recent cycle rally at Trafalgar\nSquare showed that when just a small\ngroup of London's cycling population get\ntogether they are a force to be reckoned\nwith. Changes could be made to improve\nthe safety of cyclists, if they show that\nthey need them. Part of the whole\nproblem is that people do not realise just\nhow bad the situation is. For example,\nbetween the years 1988 and 1989 there\nwas a25% increase in 'pedal cycle\naccident casualties' in London.\nYou generally accept that you are\ntaking some risk every time you set out\non your bicycle. This is regardless of the\nlength of the journey. The risk, as far as\nmost are concerned, is of some sort of\nminor accident, a brush with a car or\nsomething fairly trivial. Most take an 'it-won't happen-to-me' approach:\nunfortunately there is an increasing\nchance that it will. In fact these people\nare probably more at risk because of this\nfoolish approach.\nThere has now, very definitely, been\nshown to be a second serious threat to\nLondon cyclists (and pedestrians).\nPollution, is at dangerously high levels in\nour Capital. This may sound to some like\nscare mongering, but when you read of\nthe possibility that Central London will\nhave to be closed to traffic at certain\ntimes of the day, this has to be at least\nthought about. You can't help but notice,\nwhen you walk or ride around the city,\nthe level of unpleasantness of the\natmosphere. The. air feels heavy to\nbreathe and your clothes and hair\nbecome dirty in one afternoon. If you leave windows open, things accumulate a thick black dust. Yet the attitude in\ngeneral is the similar to that of taken\nabout accidents: that if you ignore it, it\nwill not affect you as an individual, and if\nyou aren't affected, then you don't care!\nThis attitude is both selfish, and as the\nfollowing shows, very naive. In putting\ntogether this article Felix has discovered\nsome very disturbing information. This\narticle is not based merely upon the\npersonal opinion and guesswork of an\nindividual, but hard, and mostly\nsubstantiated, facts!\nAccidents\nThe information that follows on accidents\nmay not be common knowledge, but it\nhas all come from published Metropolitan\nPolice and Department of Transport\nreports. Before continuing, it is worth\nrealising that the majority of accidents,\nincluding those where injury is caused, go\nun reported. A report published by the\nDepartment of Road Research in 1989,\nshowed that 68% of report able accidents\nwere not recorded. It may seem like a lot\nof hassle reporting what you may think is\na trivial accident to the police, but in\nbecoming a 'statistic', you would increase\nthe chances of improvements being made.\nAnyone who has ridden a bike in\nLondon, particularly Central London, will\nhave experienced the way perfectly sane\npeople can behave when they get behind\nthe wheel of a car. Experience tends to\nindicate that buses and black cabs are\nquite considerate towards cyclists, whilst\nlorry and private car drivers are not. The\nbus and cab drivers are, on the whole,\nboth more experienced drivers and have\nmore to lose if they are involved in a serious accident. The worst offender of all\nseems to be the private car driver who is\nonly in the capital for the day, and\ndoesn't want to be here at all. However,\nthere is often fault on the part of the\ncyclist, whether they are a student,\ndispatch rider, or ordinary person. There\nis no excuse, whatever the dangers on\n12\nthe main roads, for cycling on pavements,\ndown one-way streets, or through red\nlights. Most cyclists break the law at least\nonce on their journey.\nStatistically, the two most dangerous\ntimes to be on the road are between\n8.00am and 9.00am, and between 5.00pm and 6.00pm. These times reflect both the\nincrease in cycle and car journeys to and\nfrom work. These peaks of accident\npotential also coincide with the time\nmany are cycling either to, or from,\nCollege: starting the day earlier would\nplace us in the middle of the first peak!\nThere is no doubt that pedal cycles are\nbecoming increasingly more popular as a cheap and fast means of transport, but\nthe proportion of cyclists involved in\naccidents per week is also increasing.\nInner London shows the biggest increase,\nin 1989 it accounted for 52% of all pedal\ncycle accidents in the UK. The borough\nof Westminster, containing Imperial\nCollege, had the highest reported rate of\naccident per person.\nSo what can you do to improve your\nchances? Surprisingly enough, common sense is quite useful, as is the use of\nlights at night! Physically, there are some\nprecautions that you can take. So-called\n'conspicuous aids' also prevent accidents;\na large number being caused because a vehicle driver didn't see the cyclist.\nHelmets, hard-hats, lids, call them what\nyou want, may not look particularly good\nbut they do reduce head injuries. These\nare becoming now 'accepted' as part of\nthe gear used by cyclists, and the\nargument that they make you more of a target for motorists is ridiculous.\nUntil the government instigate their\nplan for a1000 mile cycle network\naround London the risk to life will\ncertainly increase.\nPollution;\nThe continual stream of traffic, that flows\n24 hours a day through and around\nLondon emits a constant flow of waste\nand un burnt products. Some vehicles may\nrun on unleaded petrol but lead is only\none of hundreds of chemicals expelled\nduring even a short journey. Cutting it\ndown is only a start. The list includes\ncarbon monoxide, a host of\nhydrocarbons, (up to 100 per vehicle),\nnitrous oxides, carbon dioxide and even\nozone, and of course it goes on, and on.\nThe actual balance of quantity and rate of\nemission depends upon the type of fuel,\nand the engine. This is not the place (and\nit shouldn't be necessary at IC) to explain\nthe environmental effects of exhaust\nemissions. However one particular\nsecondary pollutant has, in recent years,\nearned itself a mention: ozone. It is\nthought that hydrocarbons and nitrous\noxides interact, catalysed by sunlight, to\nform this favourite nasty of\nenvironmentalists.\nThere are two ways to reduce the\npollution in your lungs, by prevention at\nJr\nFELIX\nsource, and by protection. Prevention at\nsource is out of the hands of the cyclist\nand pedestrian, though they can influence\nit if enough are bothered. This process\nonly begins with unleaded petrol, there\nare technical, but currently expensive\n(probably because of their rarity) methods\nthat can be employed. These include the\nfitting of cats (catalytic converters) that\nconvert emissions to less harmful\ncompounds. Cats are already mandatory\nin Scandinavia, USA and Austria and they\nwill have to be fitted to every new British\ncar from 1 January, 1993. There are\nnegative points to them; they are\ncomplex, requiring tuning of the mixture\npassing through them, and they use finite\nresources, though for a very good reason.\nLean burn, low air/fuel mix engines, are\nanother way of improving the emissions\nfrom vehicles. Finally, 'carbon canister'\ntechnology will have to be used in the\nEEC from 1992, if draft proposals are\npassed. This technology reduces released\npetrol vapour.\nUntil emissions are reduced (and there\nis a good chance that it will be) there is a precaution that you can take. Like\nhelmets, face masks are becoming more\nand more popular, and if they are\nproperly worn, they probably do improve\nthe air breathed. However there is no\nBritish Standard, and there is significant\ndoubt as to their effectiveness during\nstrenuous exercise, and as to the length\nof their useful life.\nThere may be some hope for the\nLondon Cyclist, but improvements depend\nupon individuals actually bothering to\ncomplain about the current situation and\nthen persuading legislators to do\nsomething about it! If you do care about\nthe current dangers the only organisation\nthat is active in London is the London\nCycling Campaign. They are based in\nStamford Street, SE1.\nRichard Eyers, Cyclist!!\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nChris Riley reviews Amnesty International's latest publication: Myanmar 'In The National Interest'.\nThe Other Side Of Christmas9 FELIX\nThis month saw the launch of Amnesty\nInternational's campaign in Myanmar; to\npress for the release of prisoners of\nconscience, to end torture and\nextra judicial executions, to prompt fair\ntrials for political prisoners and to stop\ndeath sentences. To mark this launch, Al\nhas just published their account of the\nsituation, based on investigative\njournalism, and testimony from victims of\ntorture.\nAmnesty International bases its work on\ninternational human rights standards\nwhich are agreed by the international\ncommunity through the United Nations\nand other inter-governmental bodies. The\norganisation addresses itself to\ngovernments because of the specific\nobligations they have under international\nlaw. Myanmar has ratified only one major\ninternational human rights instrument, the\nConvention on the Prevention and\nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide.\nCivil unrest erupted throughout\nMyanmar (then Burma) in March 1988.\nMass demonstrations led mainly by\nstudents, called for an end to one party\nrule by the military dominated Burma\nSocialist Programme Party (BSPP).\nProtesters demanded free and fair\nelections and the introduction of multiparty parliamentary democracy. The 26\nyear rule of BSPP came to an end on\nSeptember 18th1988 when Armed Forces\nChief of Staff General, Saw Maung, led a military coup. A military State of Law\nand Order Restoration Council (SLORC)\nwas established to head the new\ngovernment and martial law was\ndeclared.\nThousands of people were killed in the\nfirst half of 1988 as the new military\ngovernment used violent measures in an\nattempt to suppress the demonstrations.\nThousands more were arrested in 1989\nfor non-violent criticism of the martial\nlaw administration and for participating in\npeaceful demonstrations called by the\nmajor political opposition parties.\nSince July 1989, arrests of opposition\nparty leaders and activists have been\njustified as measures necessary to combat\n'conspiracies' and 'machinations' against\nthe government by both 'communist' and\n'right wing' forces.\nAlthough elections were held in May of\nthis year, the military government has\nrefused to relinquish power. The SLORC\nhas acknowledged that some 1200 people,\nincluding students and members of legal\npolitical parties, were arrested between\nSeptember 18th1988 and August 1989 in\nconnection with their political activities. It\nis also acknowledged that most are still in\ndetention.\nIt is general knowledge that political\ndetainees can be held indefinitely and are\nfrequently tortured. A former civil servant\ndetained in January 1989 said he had\nbeen interrogated and beaten for three\ndays by military intelligence officers\nbefore being transferred to police\ncustody.\nAnother former detain ee, a26 year-old student from Mandalay,\narrested in late 1987, said he was\ninterrogated under torture for two weeks\nby police special branch officers before\nbeing transferred to a regular prison. 'I did not see a judge or any official from\nthe court for the following eight months I was held there. I just stayed in my cell, I had no trial.'\nDetainees' relatives usually do not\nknow the prisoners' whereabouts until\nduring interrogation to heal and to allow\nthe prisoner 'to get and look better'.\nVictims have said that torture was used\nboth to punish them and to compel them\nto cooperate with interrogators. The\ntorture also serves to intimidate others \u2014\narrest and torture is seen as an ever\npresent threat by those contemplating\nany public criticism.\nTorture methods seem consistent, and\nhave d been labelled with nicknames. 'A walk on the beach' involves forcing\nprisoners to walk on their hands and\nknees over sharp gravel or broken glass.\nThe 'helicopter' involves suspension by\nwrists or feet from a ceiling fan. The 'wet\nsubmarine' consists of near suffocation.\nPrisoners subjected to the 'iron road' are\narrested. He alleged that he was tortured\nby special branch police.\n'I was slapped, punched, kicked, burnt\nwith c iger et tes, hung from the ceiling and\nwhipped, had iron rods rolled across my\nshin bones and was given electric shocks.\nAt some point a team came in, stripped\nme of all my clothes, tied up my hands\nwith handcuffs and hung me from the\nceiling with ropes. They whipped me with\na car fan belt 70 or 80 times until I lost\nconsciousness. They treated my wounds\nby taking me down, pouring salt and\ncurry powder into the cuts and finally\nurinating on my back.'\nThe student was held until\ndemonstrators released him almost one\nyear later on 27 August 1988 when\nmilitary takeover...Because I refused to\nrespond they began ill-treating\nme...Throughout the interrogation period\nI was tortured unconscious twice, each\ntime as a result of prolonged kneeling on\nsharp gravel. This caused severe pain.\nYou first feel an intense pain and after a while your legs began shivering..your\neyes begin to cloud over until you can\nsee nothing, and then you lose control of\nyour mind: you cannot answer the\nquestions any longer. As a result they\nwould beat you up...If you fell down, you\nw oud be kicked and put back into\nposition...On several occasions I was\nthreatened with execution...'\nNumerous deaths in detention have\nbeen reported. Some occurred apparently\nthey are either released or handed over\nto police custody and transferred to a regular detention facility within the prison\nsystem.\nTorture and ill-treatment of prisoners\nusually takes place during the first phase\nof the detention process. Most people\narrested on political grounds in Myanmar\nare initially held in incommunicado\ndetention for investigation and\ninterrogation for six months or more.\nPrisoners have maintained that\nprolonged incommunicado detention is\nsometimes ordered to provide the\nnecessary time for injuries sustained\nseverely lacerated by bamboo sticks or\npolice truncheon beatings.\nBeatings, in many cases, were\nreportedly carried out after the body was\npadded with folded rice bags reducing\nexternal marks but providing no\nprotection against internal injuries.\nIn September 1987 de monet is ation was\nintroduced. The three highest\ndenomination bank notes were declared\nworthless, effectively removing 50% of all\nmoney from circulation and wiping out\nthe life savings of many citizens. During\nthe protests in Mandalay which followed\na26 year-old Physics student was\nMandalay was briefly in control of strike\ncommittees.\nOne month later the September coup\nprompted more incidents of torture and\narrests. A22 year-old student from\nAyeyarwady Division was arrested in a tea-shop in October 1988 and\ninterrogated for several days in a secret\ndetention facility. He gave the following\naccount of his treatment:\n'They wanted to know...what\norganisation I was involved with, who\nwas leading it, who were our contacts,\nwhat sort of activities did I carry out\nduring the demonstrations and since the\nas a result of ill-treatment, others because\nof the denial of medical attention. In\nMarch 1988, 41 students died in a police\nvan because of suffocation ar rising from\ngross criminal negligence.\nA former medical worker in Insein\nPrison's clinic described the case of a15 year-old boy who he said died after\ntorture in March 1988:\n'On 17 March, a15 year-old Muslim\nboy got severely burned on the abdomen\nand upper legs in an incident during\nwhich a car was set on fire by\ndemonstrating students. He was taken to\nYangon General Hospital for treatment.\nAfter a few hours, security personnel,\npossibly from the Special Branch, came in\nand took him away. The next day he was\nhanded over to the doctor in Insein\nPrison's hospital. When the doctor\nexamined him he discovered that both his\nlimbs, from fingers up to elbow, and\nlower limbs, toes to knees, had been\nfractured several times, broken into\npieces. The security people had suspected\nhim of being involved in the bombing\nincident and interrogated him despite his\nalready severe burns.'\nThe boy reportedly died 17 days after\nthis. His body was secretly cremated in\nInsein prison hospital.\nMayanmar's military government has\npersistently rejected calls for the\ninvestigation of reports of torture and ill-treatment. On 22 March 1989 Director\nGeneral Ohn Gyaw of the Foreign\nMinistry's Political Department responded\nto reports of widespread human rights\nabuse:\n'People must understand that Burma is\nfacing a difficult situation. There are not\nonly human rights to consider...there is\nthe national interest. Many accusations\nhave been made about torture and the\nlike while people have been in detention.\nThe government has no record of torture\ntaking place.'\nAmnesty International\nAmnesty International (Al) bases its work\non international human rights' standards\nwhich are agreed by the international\ncommunity through the United Nations\nand other intergovernmental bodies.

    "content": "African Head\nCharge Songs of Praise LP\nAfrican Head Charge is the product of On U Sound maestro Adrian Sherwood's efforts to bring his own distinctive sound\nto traditional African percussion and\nreggae (of sorts). As such this is a vigorously odd record, mixing deep dub\nrhythms with bizarre electro effects and\nthe odd haze guitar, which in most tracks\non this album combine to form an\nindescribable mantra. John Peel has been\ngiving this a spin of late.\nWords fail me. This is a fascinating\nalbum.\nStone10,000 Maniacs\nTown and Country Club 26.11.90\nThis was 10,000 Maniacs' second visit to\nthe T&C, marking the release of a collection of early material, Hope Chest.\nThe Maniacs' support was provided by\nJohn Lombardo, a one-time Maniacs\nbassist, and Mary Ramsey, an Irish singer-songwriter, who is a long-term friend of\nthe Maniacs. They played a number of\nsimilar-sounding Irish folk songs, which\nsignalled retirement to the bar for most\nof the audience. However, on joining the\nManiacs tor the main set, they showed\ntheir true (excellent) instrumental and\nvocal skill.\nThe Maniacs' set opened with an old\n1950s promo film for Jamestown, NYS, the band's home. This is in deference to\nNatalie Merchant's( the lead singer) views\non community power and alternative\npolitics. It was, however, sufficient to\nconfuse the R \u00a3M lookalikes in the\naudience.\nResisting constant calls from the\naudience for favourite songs, Marchant &.\nCo launched into some old material from\nHope Chest. This was an enjoyable blend\nof Reggae, Jazz and Rock. However, a fight at the front early in the set had\nvisibly shaken Merchant, who seemed to\nwant to be somewhere else.\nHowever, moving to the compassion\n{City of Angels) and militancy (What's the\nMatter here?) of the i? \u00a3M influenced In\nMy Tribe and Blind Man's Zoo, Merchant\nlifted her performance\u2014talking to the\naudience, and inserting unplanned songs\nlike Ferry's Dance Away to the\nbewilderment of the rest of the band.\nMerchant, like her boyfriend Michael\n(REM) Stripe, appropriates many60 s influences for use on stage. Her stage\npresence is enhanced by her circling\ndance, thrashing about her flowing dress\nand long, dark hair.

As far as this writer\nis concerned, 'maturity' = 'plodding ly unoriginal', 'dynamism' = 'turgidity' and\n'unique brand of Rock/ Blues'= 'the\ndullest parts of Rock and the most boring\nparts of Blues'. The man responsible for\nmixing this record is also responsible for\nSade and Everything But The Girl. Cure\nfans spotting the near-miss title Praying\nFor Rain will be disappointed.

    "content": "9\nFELIX\nSir Clive Sinclair presents his vision of tomorrow...\nInventing the Future When Sir Clive Sinclair visited Imperial\nCollege on Wednesday 5th November, he\nsaid that his company, Sinclair Research,\nwould be launching personal telephones\nand the composite-fibre bicycles next\nyear. He addressed a tightly-packed\nlecture theatre on the subject 'Inventing\nthe Future.'\nIn this he questioned the common belief\nthat we are living in times of huge\ntechnological change, stating that, on the\ncontrary, things have not changed a great\ndeal over the last twenty years. He put\nforward the idea that this was because\nover the last couple of decades,\ntechnological companies have become\nglobal, swallowing competitors, until just\na few mono polis e the world markets.\nWhile this brought economies of scale, it\nalso means that to invest in anything new\nbecomes a huge risk. To change to a new\ntechnology means massive re investment in production lines in factories all over\nthe world, and because companies tend\nto be run by cautious accountants rather\nthan entrepreneurs, the risks are rarely\ntaken, hence the stagnation in\ntechnology. The price of production\nefficiency is that it becomes too\nexpensive to change.\nTo support this argument, he quoted\nseveral examples. Each year since 1976,\nthe average speed of air traffic across the\nAtlantic has declined: this is because the\nnumber of subsonic flights has increased\nwhile supersonic flights have remained at\na constant level. This is the monopoly of\nthe Boeing 747, which has been flying for\n25 years, yet no challenger has emerged\nsince then. What has happened? Airbus\nIndustries started a new family of aircraft,\nyet this was still based on the tube-with-wings concept, whereas it has been\nknown for years that 'flying wings' offer\nup to 30% increase in efficiency. Why is\nthis 'new' technology not used? The risks\nof failure are too great and the time-length of the product is too long (the new\nBoeing 777 has a design life of 40 years):\nlarge companies must not be allowed to\nrisk going bankrupt.\nFor several decades, we have been\npromised large flat-screen wall-mounted\ntelevisions: Professor Gabor (famous for\nholography) worked on the problem 30\nyears ago, but the product is still \"just\naround the corner \". Improvements and\nnew technology are \"not because people\ndon't want it or don't work on it\" but\nbecause the unread f hess for change\n\"seems to be a function of the\nconcentration of the power\" that\nmanufacturers have.\nHe said that while products such as the\nIBM PC set standards, they also froze the\nentire industry, because no-one dares to\nmake anything different. \" We need\ncompanies to explore the territory so we\ncan find the best.\" \"We have lost the will\nto change\": suspension bridges could be\nSir Clive with his phone point phone.\nfive miles in span using composite fibres.\nWhy tunnel under the Channel using\n150-year old technology when you could\nbridge it with five spans? \"Incredible\ncaution is the ultimate enemy of\ninnovation. We must have people making\ndecisions, prepared to take a leap into the\nfuture.\"\nSo where do we go today? The big,\nCurrently fashionable although age-old\nproblem is the environment. He thought\nthat, ultimately, \"all transport has to be\nelectric\", using energy from wind\ngenerators, solar power, water power\n(tidal, waves, and hydroelectric), these\nsources being \"very close to economic\nreality.\" Aircraft could be powered by\nhydrogen. He said that even the USA could generate all its energy requirements\nfrom wind. (Fossil fuels must go in the\nlong term because of carbon dioxide\nemission.) He hypothesis ed that\n\"invention is often the mother of\nnecessity\": before the invention of the\nball-point pen or photocopier, no-one\nperceived a need for such things. The\nnecessity follows the invention, but \"the\ninventor has to pursue his own idea with\nincredible vigour\" in order for it to\nsucceed. \"Inventions mean change,\" but\nwe are genetically programmed to resist\nchange, since, in the past it was mostly\nfor the worse. Sir Clive also gave\nexamples close to his heart, the pocket\ncalculator and the digital watch. When he\nwent round to various companies to find\nout if they would produce them, none of\nthem could see any market for them.\nHe concluded by outlining some of the\nresearch areas his company is working in:\n\u2022 Artificial intelligence. This is a long-term project which he considers\nimportant in increasing human wealth in\neducation, health, leisure and services.\nThey are working on parallel processing,\nusing silicon wafers containing thousands\nof processors running simultaneously.\n\u2022 Personal telephones that work anywhere in the world. He considers a very tight-packed cellular 'phone system\ncombined with satellites to be the best\nsolution. Babies will be able \"to have\ntheir personal 'phone number tattooed on\nthem at birth,\" the number remaining\ntheirs for life.\n\u2022 Wind power. \u2022 Electric cars. \"The C5 was intended as\na stepping stone.\" At the time of the C5,\nthe C15, a four-seat electric vehicle had a range of 150 miles. The latest version has\na range of 250 miles, max speed 80 mph,\n0-60 mph in 7 seconds. He said \"they\nwon't suit everyone,\" but sooner or later\nplug-in recharge points \"should become\nubiquitous.\"\n\u2022 Composite-fibre bicycle. He hopes this\nwill meet an as-yet un perceived need for\nan instant-folding, easily-portable bicycle\nthat can be carried around by people,\ninstead of leaving it locked up.\nRoland Flowerdew.\n28\n\n"

A year later, Hippo waits at the\nairport for Nathalie to return from\nBoston...\nThough the character of Hippo reminds\n\u2022\nAtrocities didn't just happen to\nsoldiers during the Second World\nWar\u2014but I'm not talking about\noccupied Europe here. America, land of\nthe free, home of the American Dream,\nlocked all Japanese immigrants in\nconcentration camps within months of the\nbombing of Pearl Harbour. Even people\nwho were only l/16 th Japanese could be\nforcibly evacuated under Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066. A fascinating and\nnot a little horrifying story, and one\nworthy of being debated on film.\nIt is not the only theme that Alan\nParker (Mississippi Burning, Fame, Bugsy\nMalone) chooses to address in his latest\nfilm, but it is by far the most significant.\nThe start of the film is a blind, a set up\nfor the character of Jack, an Irish\nAmerican and active member of the Film\nProjectionist's Union. Jack (played by\nDennis Quaid, back on form after the dire\nWhen I Fall in Love) ends up working in\na small Japanese Theatre owned by Mr Kawamure. While taking a lunch break\nwith Charlie, Kawamura's son and an all-American boy, Jack sees Lily through a shop window, falling madly in love with\nher. Facing prejudice from the Japanese\ncommunity they elope and marry, but\nwhen Jack gets arrested on a demo Lily\nreturns home, just in time to be\nevacuated with the rest of her family. She\nends up in a camp in the middle of a desert, and Jack in the army.\nWhat starts off as a love story, with a bit of working class agi prop, suddenly\nveers off into a tale of prejudice, hysteria\n(similar perhaps to that which fueled Alan\nBailey's letter to this very organ) and\nREVIEWS\nme of the one by Jean Paul Belmonde in\nBout de Souffle, Monsieur Hippolyte\nGirardot manages to bring some\nfreshness. One cannot deny being\nattracted by his charm just one minute\nafter the film has started, when the\ncamera focuses on him walking home\ncasually with a smile so full of self-confidence. No wonder he won the\nFrench 'Oscars' for Most Promising Young\nActor with this film!\nThis first feature of the promising,\nyoung French director Eric Rochant won him the Prix Louis Delluc and French\n'Oscars' for Best First Film. He\nsuccessfully catches the contemporary\nminds of young Parisiens, as condensed\ninto Hippo and Nathalie's characters. The\ncarefree ness of Hippo and the positiv it y of Nathalie, as well as the characters of\nothers such as Xavier, Hippo's friend\nHalper, his ex-girlfriend Francine and his\nparents, blend well into this charming\ntrag i comedy, that could easily be the\nmost contemporary film so far this year.\nS Su.\nman's ability to be cruel to each other in\ndirect contradiction of all that they\npurport to stand for.\nTechnically, the film is stunning. Well\nshot with beautiful period detail, it could\nalmost be contemporary, but for the\nmessage and colour. The emotional\ncharge is strong, and the film moving. I would wholeheartedly recommend this\nfilm but for one reservation\u2014at 133\nminutes it is a little over-long, and could\nhave done with a little compression of\nthe opening sequence. With the love\nstory, and the serious prejudice theme\nperhaps this can be best described as an\nintellectual date move. See it anyway.\nPendragon.\n9\nCome See The Paradise\n\n"

    "content": "LETTERS\nScribblers' Corner.. Eager\nDear FELIX,\nIam writing with regard to Alan Bailey's letter published in your issue of\nFriday 16 November.\nI was glad to note from the response to\nthe above-mentioned letter that 1 wasn't the only person alarmed by the\nnationalistic and racialist ic questions in\ncontained. However, none of the replies\nfully captured my personal feelings\ntowards it.\nAlmost every country in this world has\na period or aspect of its past of which it\ncannot be proud. Japan is one such\nexample. Britain is another.\nWhat is important however, is the\nmanner in which a nation emerges from\nthese dark periods of its history and what\nit learns from them.\nThe Japanese have reconstructed a cultured and humane society of which it\nmay be proud. Japan's defence budget\nonly takes up 1% of its gross domestic\nproduct\u2014just imagine the vast resources\nwhich would be freed if other\nindustrialised nations followed this lead.\nIn addition to this, perhaps in\nacknowledgement of its war guilt, Japan\nhas become the largest single aid donor\nnation in the world.\nThe attraction of aid to developing\ncountries is that it is free of the 'political\nstrings' attached by other western\nnations.\nIf it is these achievements that Prince\nCharles was paying tribute to at Emperor\nHirohito's enthronement, then so be it\u2014\nthey deserve wider recognition.\nThe Prince's support for important and\nrelevant causes is most impressive.\nInstead of beating the blind patriotic\ndrum which would please Bailey even so\nmuch, he focuses attention on the real\ninadequacies of his nation\u2014thereby\nmaking a concrete contribution to the\nsociety he lives in. Indeed, if it is true\nthat for a nation to improve itself it must\nacknowledge its own faults, it explains\nwhy Japan is where it is today (and\nunfortunately wh re Britain is as well).\nIn Charles' support for saving the\ntropical rainforest he has his weight\nbehind an issue of far greater importance\nto mankind than honouring the war dead\nwho\u2014it must be remembered\u2014may never\nbe brought back to life again. To argue\notherwise, shows an ignorance of the real\ndangers facing us today. And it is not by saying how 'gloriously' our boys won the\nwar that these problems will go away.\nEach\nDear Chris,\nI would like to take this opportunity to\nwish Alan Bailey a very merry Christmas.\nUnfortunately Bailey will probably not\nappreciate this as Christ (Son of God\u2014a God accepted by the majority of this\nplanet's population, not just by Bailey and several other right wing xenophobic\nbigots\u2014have you looked them up yet?)\nhad two major 'faults' according to\nBailey's way of reckoning. Firstly the Son\nof God was Jewish i.e. not English so\nprobably not a Tory. Secondly He was\npoor, so again probably would not have\nbeen too en amour ed with Thatch. (Before\nanyone criticises my use of past tense I Sorry Bailey.\nI do, however, have an honest word of\nadvice for Bailey. I urge him to travel a bit around the world and see how other\npeople live and think. This will: (a) enable\nhim to put Britain, or his perceptions of\nBritain, in a proper perspective. That\nincludes appreciating, both its role as an\nimperialistic aggressor and, its\ncontribution to the intellectual and\ntechnological development of man. (b) Let\nhim see what makes up a nation and a people\u2014and how different that can be\nfrom the ambitions of a handful of\npoliticians who claim to act in its interest.\nIt is the failure of these politicians\nwhich we acknowledge every\nremembrance day\u2014the war dead being\ntheir victims.\nPaul Hastings, Aero 2.\nam using an historic perspective\u2014look it\nup Alan.)\nOver and above this, Christmas is 'The\nseason of good will to all men' \u2014 ALL MEN black, white, yellow, pink, green, straight,\ngay, Christian, Moslem, Buddhist, Hindu,\nShinto, agnostic, atheist, and yes even\nAlan Bailey.\nSo happy Christmas Alan, I wish you no\nharm (you seem to be good enough at\nthat yourself) but do try to engage your\nobviously faulty brain before you spout\noff any more xenophobic (still not looked\nit up?) crap.\nYours,\nLarry O 'Brien.\nWhat'sOn AN UP-TO-THE-MINUTE GUIDE TO EVENTS\nIN AND AROUND IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nWEDNESDAY\nKeep Fit 12.30pm Southside Gym.\nCycling Training 1.00pm Meet at Beit Arch.\nWargames v1.00 pm UDH.

As a kid's film it's pretty good stuff.\nYou've got revenge on grown-ups and\nbrothers, the chance to do whatever you want, and some real baddies to fight.\nPerfect fantasy for knee-biter s. They're\nalso going to love the gratuitously violent\nway in which Kevin sees off his attackers\n- and so will you!\nAlthough this is a kids' film, and as such\nnot one you're likely to see, if you do\nhave to take assorted brats out this\nChristmas, you'll probably enjoy this\nmore than you expected. This has been a FELIX Christmas survival message.\nPendragon. Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde\nThis stage adaptation of Robert\nLouis Stevenson's novel works\nremarkably well. With a cast of\nonly four, the Empty Space Theatre\nCompany, who specialise in adapting the\nworks of famous authors for the stage,\nmanage to recreate the horror and\nsuspense of the novel.\nDr Jekyll is a scientist fascinated by\nmystical things. He speculates on the\npossibility of separating our primeval self\nfrom our 'civilised' self\u2014freeing us from\nthe constraints imposed by conscience\nand society and leaving us at liberty to\npursue the pleasures and the cravings of\nthe flesh.\nDespite scorn from his former\ncolleague, Jekyll manages to isolate the\nessence to make this separation possible\nand starts to lead a double life.\nFortunately Mr Hyde\u2014as he calls his\nother half\u2014does not have a physical\nresemblance to Jekyll and they therefore\ncannot be identified as the same person.\nHowever, it is impossible to avoid their\nnames being linked and people are at a loss to under t and why such a well\nrespected person as Dr Jekyll should be\nassociated with so despicable a chap as\nHyde.\nJekyll leads this double life for a while\nuntil Hyde kills a man. Overcome with\nhorror by what he, as Hyde, is capable of\ndoing, he resolves to be done with Hyde.\nIt is only then that he begins to realise\nthe power of what he has released.\nThe staging is stark. A door and a carpet ripped in two down the centre.\nThe torn carpet symbolises the split\npersonality of Jekyll and Hyde\u2014in fact a conflict in all of us because we all contain\nthese two opposing natures.\nThe door is a recurring image in the\nplay: what goes on behind closed doors?\nJekyll and Hyde transform, doors within\nthe mind, secrets from people and, at the\nend Jekyll hides behind a closed door.\nThe play is well acted, the symbolism\nachieves its objectives\u2014that of advancing .\nand providing insight into the plot, and\nthere are some very effective scenes and\ntableaux. The atmosphere and flavour of\nthe book is evolved superbly and it is a very effective way of making this\nclassic\u2014of which everybody has heard,\nbut few have read\u2014accessible to the\npeople.\nThe Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr\nHyde is on at the Battersea Arts Centre\nuntil December 16 at 8.00pm from\nWednesday to Sunday. Concessionary\ntickets cost S4.00 plus SI.00 membership.\nJ LW. The Olivier family together, on\nstage! Directed by their brother!\nThe headlines are a screaming\nagain as a hype machine swings into\naction. What is the performance like,\nthough?\nJ.B Priestly's play is interesting, and\namusing, but by no means a classic. The\nConway family are a rich middle class at\nthe end of the first world war. They are\npresided over by a matriarchal mother\n(Joan Plowright) after the death (by\ndrowning) of the father. The children are\nall gathering to celebrate Kay's21st birthday, and Robin's de mob. Various\nother people have gathered as well, and\nthey start to form relationships that will\ndominate their lives 19 years later. Which is, in fact, when the second act is set.\nAfter an act's worth of failed hopes and\nshattered relationships, we skip back 19\nyears again to find out what caused all\nthose problems.\nOlivier's widow, Joan Plowright,\ncompletely dominates much of the play,\nwhich only really sparks into life with her\narrival on-stage. The majority of the cast\nalso turn in as sparkling a performance as\nthey can from her shadow. The task of\nswapping between two ages is not easy\nand is managed admirably by all. The characters are vastly different in some\ncases, but all are still recognisable (but\nnot to the obtuse lady sitting behind\nme...). Perhaps the only disappointment\nwas Tasmin Olivier who turned in a fairly\nwooden performance, until near the end,\nproving that acting talent may not be\ngenetic.\nThe dramatic fabric the cast weave\ncontains all the normal threads. They\nbeautifully incorporate despair and hope,\nhumor and grief, love and fear. The play\nis inherently bleak of message, without\nbeing disheartening. One does not leave\nthe theatre depressed but thoughtful. In\nfact, as one impressed punter said as they\nleft the theatre, 'It's rather good isn't it?'.\nPendragon.6 "

    "content": "raised \u00a3700. \u00a3 1 3 0 was made from the Bar\nQuiz, won by the FELIX team (I add in\nan unbiased sort of way). The Exec.\nInitiative proved once again that the\nUnion Executive are bloody difficult to\nget rid of. This year they were all\nchained together and I suggest that to\nmake it more difficult a large concrete\nblock should be attached and the group\nthrown from Battersea Bridge. Any takers? The Nude Kamikaze Parachute\nJump raised over \u00a3390 and the Mines\nDirty Disco raised \u00a3250.\nContinuing Stories\nAs in previous years Southside locks were\nchanged without telling the occupants.\nLast year this caught out the warden of\none of the halls. Indeed, last year there\nwas a serious cafu ff le over the keys so\nthat the fobs that were handed out were\nout of date and so were useless.\nThere is to be a hall in Ealing called\n'Clayponds' for 405 students, the buying\nof which was to be financed by the sale\nof Montpelier Hall. The latter aspect has\ntemporarily fallen through due to\nproblems in assuring the binding of any\ncontract. This leaves a few concerned\nstudents hanging in mid air and confusion\nstill reigns over the whole affair.\nUniversity College has finally sold bits\nof its union. The union, for its part, seems\nremarkably calm about this after the\nfur ore it kicked up last year. I get the\nfeeling that some agreement has been\nmade, or is in the process of being made,\nbetween the college and the union which\nis mutually beneficial and which they\nwon't tell. Queen Mary and Westfield\nCollege has taken drastic action to save\nmoney\u2014it has decided to close at least\none department and severely curtail\nothers.\nAnother old chestnut\u2014the mysterious\ncase of the collapsing ceilings. This has\nbeen going on in this College's older\nresidencies for as long as I can\nremember. Two people whose names\nseem to appear whenever the word 'ceiling' is uttered are Joe Dines and\nPeter Hallworth. The latter is the Scarlet\nPimpernel of estates. Amazingly,\nwhenever another ceiling collapses he is\nsuddenly booked up for meetings until\nthe ceiling collapse ceases to be news.\nQuite an extraordinary coincidence. Far\nbe it from me to deduce any deceit in\nthis, I'm sure it's in the residents' interests\nthat the knowledge that the building in\nwhich they live is unsafe is kept from\nthem. They might decide to refuse rent,\nsimply leave or start complaining. That\nwould never do.\nGeneral Stupidity\nTowards the beginning of the year some\ncontractors\u2014probably related to the\ncontractors mentioned in last year's FELIX, namely 'Bodgeit and Leggit'\u2014were\nresponsible for drilling a hole in IC\nScience Fiction Society's Library door\nsomewhere under Beit Quad. All they\nwere required to do was to lay a power\ncable, but no, Bodgeit and Leggit enjoy\nmaking holes in walls, ceilings and doors.\nThey get so little fun these days, poor\ndears.\nOn a somewhat bigger scale, the\nUniversity Funding Council, a body\nproducing a lot of hot air and very little\nmoney, refuse to fund the universities to\nthe levels the universities thought they\nneeded. In summary, universities must\nsupport more students to a better level of\neducation with less money. Quite a good\npre c is of Conservative Party policy. The\nnet result of this is that students have to\npay the difference. Things are getting\nvery tight at IC, the membrane separating\nImperial College from Imperial College\npic is becoming dangerously thin. Already\nthe London School of Economics and\nUniversity College have considered\ncharging tuition fees.\nTower's lions had been so seriously\nembarrassed that a deep red had suffused\nits otherwise stony cheeks. The culprit\nwas probably from King's College and is\nnot known. The red paint was removed\nsoon after, costing over \u00a3200. The lion\nhad been painted before and then had\nbeen sandblasted clean. Mr Reeves\ncommented 'If we have to sandblast the\nlions much more we'll end up with a couple of bloody mice'.\nResignation or Office Shifts\nThere was a startling coincidence\nbetween events of National Importance in\nthe Conservative Party and our own homely college. Suzanne Ahmet resigned\nas External Affairs Office to become\nRCSU President. Soon after Geoffrey\nHowe resigned to become a nobody. Bad luck Geoff. When Reggie 'Madame JoJo'\nBlennerhassett, the libidinous leprechaun\nof the Union Office resigned, the shock\nwaves penetrated the Conservative Party\nThe axe-man cometh.\nContinuing with another Government\nbugbear, the student loans saga, by the\nbeginning of November only 200 out of\n6,000 students had applied. This could\nmean one of two things\u2014either students\nare so wealthy that they don't need them\nor they object to the idea of student\nloans. Anybody with half a brain would\nnot find that dilemma too difficult to\nsolve. Unfortunately the upper echelons\nof the Government sold most of their\nbrains to the Devil on the way up.\nInvoluntary decapitation was the order\nof the day as scores of people watched\nthe police deal with a suspected car bomb\nin Queens Gate. Fortunately it was a false\nalarm, but the IC security officers\nexpressed concern that so many people\nwere unaware of the possibly fatal\nconsequences of an explosion.\nThere were red lions all round when it\nwas discovered that one of the Queens\ncentral office and out tumbled Margaret\nThatcher. I advise Mr Major to watch\nclosely, his fate is in the Union's hands.\nThings were happening in Sherfield\nwhen Tom Stevens, IC Business Manager,\nwas given the jolly old heave-ho. Angus\nFraser, the man in the know, gave the\never-so damning 'no comment' and left it\nto our imagination. News reporters have\nfantastic imaginations so this was a rather\nsilly thing to do\u2014I suspect there were a lot of spinal injuries in Sherfield that\nweek. This affair may have something to\ndo with Rob Northey's announced\nintention to resign. Mr Northey was IC's Refectory Manager and has done a lot of\nwork on the College's eateries. What little\nreason he gave for leaving was\ninterrupted by meaningful silences and\nmany a chuckled 'I'm not going to tell\nyou'. The imagination runs riot.\n31\n\n"

    "content": "Dr Stephen Richardson on the Public Equiry chaired by the\nHon. Lord Cullen into the...\nPiper Alpha Disaster Late in the evening of July, 1988, there\nwas an explosion on the Piper Alpha platform in the North Sea. Within a matter of a few hours, 166 men had died.\nOne more died in hospital twelve days\nlater. Over 10% of this country's production of oil had ceased. The world's biggest offshore oil disaster had\nhappened\u2014and it had happened not in\nsome remote corner of the world but in\nthe UK. What had gone wrong on Piper?\nAnd why did it have such disastrous\nconsequences?\nThe safety and operation of Britain's North Sea oil and gas platforms is, for the\ntime being, under the control of the\nSecretary of State for Energy. One week\nafter the disaster on Piper, the then\nSecretary of State, Cecil Parkinson,\nappointed Lord Cullen to hold a Public\nInqury to establish the circumstances of\nthe accident on Piper Alpha and its cause.\nThe Inquiry sat for a total of 180 days,\n130 of which were concerned with the\ndisaster itself (Part 1) and the remaining\n50 with the future (Part 2). Lord Cullen's report was published on November 13\n1990 and is extremely thorough and\nhence necessarily lengthy. The Inquiry\nheard evidence from a large number of\nwitnesses\u2014including most of the\nsurvivors\u2014and from several experts.\nMuch of that expert testimony was\nprovided by three members of the\nChemical Engineering Department at\nImperial College: Ken Bett, Graham\nSaville and me. Of the total of 35 experts'\nreports produced in Part 1 of the Inquiry,\n11 were produced by the three of us. As a result, we got to know a great deal\nabout what had happened on Piper. What\nfollows is a brief summary of the events\nleading to the disaster and some of my personal views (which I believe accord in\nall essentials with Lord Cullen's recommendations) on the way ahead.\nThe Piper oil field is about 120 miles\nnorth-west of Aberdeen. It was discovered\nby Occidental in January 1973 and was\none of the first in the deep waters of the\nnorthern North Sea. Production of oil\nstarted in December 1976, so that less\nthan four years elapsed between\ndiscovery and first oil, a record that has\nonly rarely been beaten. Originally, only\noil was to be exported. This was done\nthrough a sub-sea line 128 miles long to\nthe purpose-build Occidental refinery on\nthe island of Flotta in the Orkneys. Piper\nproved spectacularly productive. Indeed,\none of its wells was the most productive\nin the whole of the North Sea. When Occidental sought permission to raise\noutput from Piper, the then Secretary of\nDEPARTMENT OF ENERGY\nThe Public Inquiry\ninto the\nPiper Alpha Disaster\nThe Hon Lord Cullen\nFigure 1\nState for Energy, Tony Benn, granted it\nonly on condition that the excess gas\nproduced with the oil, and initially flared\nat Piper, should be exported. Accordingly,\na gas treatment plant was incorporated\non Piper rather as an afterthought. Gas\nexport started in December 19.78. The\namount of gas exported by Piper was,\nhowever, very small (only about 0.6% of\nthe total from the UK sector of the North\nSea) whereas the amount of oil exported\nwas large (about 10% of the total from\nthe UK sector: Piper was the biggest\nsingle producing platform). In order to\nmaximise the oil export, some of the\nheavier fractions in the gas (essentially,\nthe propane) were separated as liquid\ncondensate from the rest of the gas\n(mainly methane) and injected into the oil\nfor export to Flotta, as shown in Figure 2.\nAt about 21.45 on July 6, 1988, one of\nthe pumps for injection of condensate\ninto the main oil export line tripped.\nShortly afterwards, some gas alarms were\nactivated, the first-stage gas compressors\ntripped and the flare was observed to be\nmuch larger than usual. At about 22.00\nthere was the first explosion on Piper.\nThis rapidly led to fires in the part of\nPiper containing the oil/gas separators\n(see Figure 2) and oil export pumps.\nFlames and smoke rapidly enveloped the\naccommodation modules on the platform,\nin which the majority of the men on\nPiper were off-duty. At about 22.20, the\nfires had heated one of the high-pressure\ngas lines connecting Piper to another\nplatform, the Tartan platform operated by\nTexaco (see Figure 3), to such an extent\nthat the pipe ruptured and the gas in the\nline flowed out very rapidly, further\nfuelling the fires on Piper. Gas initially\nflowed out of the line at about 3 tonnes\nper second, which is of the same order as\nthe rate at which the UK consumes\nenergy. A photograph showing the\nfireball almost immediately after rupture\nof the Tartan line is reproduced on the\nfront cover of Lord Cullen's report (see\nFigure 1).\nThe situation on Piper was rapidly\nescalating. At about 22.50, another gas\nline ruptured, this time the line to the\ncompression platform (MCP-01) operated\nby Total, the chief function of which is as\nan intermediate pumping platform for gas\nfrom the giant Frigg field (see Figure 3).\nAgain, gas initially flowed out of the line\nat about 3 tonnes per second. At about\n23.20, the final gas line, that to Claymore\nwhich is the other platform operated by\nOccidental in the North Sea (see Figure\n3), ruptured. At much the same time,\nlarge sections of the structure of the\nplatform had weakened so much that\nmost of the topsides (in other words the\nparts of Piper above the supporting steel\njacket) fell into the sea. One of the parts\nof the topsides that fell into the sea was\nthe main accommodation module, a four-storey building in which there were 81\nmen. All of them died.\nIn the early morning of July 7 1988,\nthe only remaining part of Piper was the\nwell-head module: three-quarters of the\noriginal platform had been destroyed and\nlay in a tangled mass on the sea bed. The\nfires from the oil and gas lines and wells\nwere producing flames about 200 metres\nhigh, with a rate of energy consumption\nof order 100 gigawatts. The fires were\nextinguished finally only on July 29 1988.\nThe remains of Piper was toppled on\nMarch 28 1989.\nThe disaster had cost the lives of 167\nmen, 2 of whom were rescue workers\nwhose fast rescue boat was destroyed\nwhen the gas line to MCP-01 ruptured.\n137 of the bodies of the deceased were\nrecovered; 30 are still missing. Of the\n137, 109 died from smoke inhalation, 13\n\n"

A typical career\nin Schlumberger will lead in and out of technical, management and support\nroles, broadening experience, providing a unique variety and building the\nstrongest corporate management potential of tomorrow.\nAnd while we are looking for the potential in our recruits to benefit from this\nphilosophy, we do not compromise on engineering expertise.

    "content": "FELIX braves the Beers Steers and Queers in a daring encounter with.\nm \u00ab W*%1#1 FELIX interviews...\nThe Revolting COCKS Swervedriver\nIf you walk into a hotel bar, full of rejects\nfrom the set of Spinal Tap and shout\n'Okay who are the Revolting Cocks then?'\nyou expect an unusual response. Mine\nwas; 'Yep that's us'.\nThey sat me down and introduced\nthemselves: Alien called Al wore a cowboy hat, shades and had three days\nstubble over his entire head; Chris was\nLevi-clad with straggly hair looking like\nhe had spent most of his life glue sniffing\nand Paul Raven bassist of Killing Joke\nadding some weight to the interview, as if\nto prove the Revolting Cocks had to be\ntaken seriously.\nThe Revolting Cocks, have a bad\nreputation; banned on Radio and TV and not allowed to play gigs in this country,\nafter a campaign against them by Conservative MP Teddy Taylor. As well\nas this, members of the band have been\narrested for male prostitution and charges\nof bestiality on stage. The Revolting\nCocks have come to clear their name.\nThey set about this immediately:\nAl: It's a pack of fucking lies everything\nyou've read...\nMe: I haven't read anything honest!\nPaul: Well, it's all true then.\nChris: Yeah, let's make up some new ones.\nAl: What we do on stage is very strange,\nfive or six of us go on, with our backing\ntapes and play instruments! This happens\nstill! I don't wear leather pants or scream\ninto an echo plex we don't do that...\nMe: So where has the hype come from?\nAl:I don't know, I'd like to find the\nbastard that did and beat the crap out of\nhim, or give him50 quid, I don't know which. I mean, as far as the guitar player\ngetting arrested, that's true, the herd of\ncattle, the electric fence, no that's not\ntrue, who would have an electric fence\non stage? It's nothing but lawsuits for the\nrest of your life.\nPaul: Why not razor wire or flame\nthrowers?\nAl: Here's what I think happened. We have a lot of girls who want to dance\nwith us on stage everywhere we go, we don't care, race, colour, creed, whatever\nas long as they don't touch our deli or\ndrink our beer, fuck that's great. In\nHouston we had a bunch of girls none of\nthem under 20 stone. Then someone\ncomes backstage and shouts 'There's a bunch of cows on stage!' and by the time\nit gets back to the English press, I 've\nridden a mechanical bull on stage, fucked\none of them, used a cattle prod on the\nrest. I mean, this is just what happens.\nChris: Yeah we're a bunch of fucking\nchoir boys.\nAl: Right we're nice lads, we're from\nBasildon really.\nMe: What's your version of the guitar\nplayer being arrested then?\nAl:I mean there's a lot of grains of truth\nin these stories, he was pissed out of his\nbrain and wandering a section of Houston\nknown for male prostitution, cause that\nwas where the club was at and Marc was\nout drunk and tried to flag down a taxi,\nonly it was a police car and as it passed\nhe got mad, 'cause he thought it was a taxi, picked up a rock and threw it. As they saw he was wearing a 'Beer Steers\nand Queers' t shirt (their latest album)\nthought he was a prostitute so they\narrested him, in the process found two\nsleeping pills on him because the poor\nbastard can't sleep on a tour bus all the\nrocking and shaking, and that gets blown\nout of proportion, so he was giving blow\njobs in an alley with five hits of LSD on him, what gets me was he was in a cell\nwith a child molester facing six months\nand Marc could have been up for 8-10\nyears, he did get off on all charges, which\nis good.\nMinistry we got booked into a hotel\nunder the pretense we were a religious\nsect in Denver Colorado for four days.\nAl: Five days.\nChris: Best fucking five days of my life.\nAl: Year of course we poured soap suds\nin the pool, set off all the alarms, all the\nbasic shit.\nChris: These people were tripping their\nbrains out!\nAl: This was the first time the band and the actual bus driver went wacko. We had two bus drivers; a husband and wife\nteam. He pulled a45 on her, we were'all\ntripping so we got our cameras and\nstarted shooting, while the police and the\nsquad team came in he was on the 6th floor trying to throw his wife off, he'd drawn both buses up to the entry, it was\nlike a semicircle so there was no way in\nor out, and had thrown all the luggage\nout and cut the fuel lines so there was\nMe: that's fair enough. OK, how was the\nSunday Sport party?\nChris: It was really great, it was the best\nparty I have ever been to, there was two\nkinds of people there, bimbos with\nmassive tits and lecherous old men, and\nme, I got my photo like with two babes\ns it tin' on my knee with their tits hang in' out, great man.Al: When we got back there was a Spanish maid cleaning our rooms, so I used all my Spanish on her which is drop\neverything and let's fuck! She left fast...!\nMe: Do you ever get banned or thrown\nout of places?\nAl: No No, we get out of places like this,\nthis is a rock flea bag more bands per\ncapita, you know after you've seen Iggy\nPop passed out in an elevator throwing\nup on himself, once you've seen one\npuke a th on you've seen them all.\nChris: When we were touring with\nfuel everywhere, this happened during\nhappy hour so we were all in the bar\ntripping and rooting for him with\nJapanese tourists taking pictures of the\nwhole thing.\nChris: He'd like taken a bunch of crystal\nmeth a dry ne then hallucinogens and half a bottle of se grams, he was out of his\nfuckin' head, he drank a bottle of whisky\nat seven in the morning.\nAl: He just lost it, he just had a bad\nday...just a bit!\nChris: It was just the ministry tour.\nAl: That was the time Martin got accused\nof rape.\nChris: That's right.\nPaul: This is obviously a well kept secret.\nA l:Ask him 'Ask him'.\nPaul: Should go down well at the right\ndinner party!\nAl: Here's the rub man. This is Martin\nAtkins of Public Image, Killing Joke. First\nnight in Denver, and some roadie asks a girl back to the hotel, and they're sitting\nin the bar drinking and her boyfriend\nwalks in and says\u2014I wanna talk to you,\nwhat are you doing with these heathen\nscum, she goes out\u2014says 'They\nkidnapped me and tried to rape me'\u2014and\nfin gu red Martin, he's the high profile\nband member, he drags her up to this\nparty on the sixth floor and goes round\nsaying 'Where's Martin, I wanna find\nMartin', I say what for\u2014rape\u2014so I knew it was a crock of shit cause Martin's, you know...so I grab the guy and her in the\nelevator, it's kinda like blackmail, and\nsaid 'now say it isn't true' and it wasn't, she says it was so I hit T' and keep\nhitting the guy 'til we hit the first floor\nand the doors open, and it was a glass\nelevator so everyone was cheering me on\nin the lobby, and she says 'it was true, it\nwas true, so I hit '6' and we goy sent\nback up. After the 3rd trip down and he's got blood pouring everywhere, she goes 'I lied, I lied', so I let them both go, and they went off to the police and they\ndidn't go after me or Martin but John our\ntour manager, so the squad team descend\non John's room right and break down the\ndoor and John is in bed with another girl\nwhose more than willing and able so he\nobviously didn't rape her and the police\nare going 'he doesn't look like a rapist to\nme' and the girl has sheets around her\nneck going 'what's the problem officers?'\nso he got off. He had to go and see them\nin the morning. Not that I'm like\nadvertising what we do just take it or\nleave it. That's what we are, man. Chris: At least we're not banned here.\nMe: You are.\nAl: what's this man?\nMe: You're banned, they can't play you're\nrecord on TV or radio.\nChris: But they just did an interview with\nme, they can't do that and not play the\nmusic, and I say fuck every other fuckin'\nword.\nMe: They'll just block it out.\nAl: That's what we mean man, let them\nban us we don't care, we just want to\nmake records, we don't even want\nsuccess, if we had money we'd just build\na studio. I mean Teddy Taylor wants us\nout of here, but Chris last night caught\nhim sucking some girls t it ties, at the Sport\nparty we have photographs, so he's gonna lay off us.\nChris: And we're gonna make a lot of\nmoney!\nAl: This is a scoop for you, a world\npremier, a couple of thousand students\nare gonna be the first to know about\nTeddy Taylor. So we're gonna come here\nin January and walk up to immigration\nand say we are the Revolting Cocks we would like entry to your fine empire and\nif they say no, then we'll start some\nshit...hey you don't know where I can get\nsome cattle by any chance...\nClose to midnight, backstage at the\nCamden Palace. Swervedriver are due on\nstage soon. Introduced by their manager\nRichard, Adam, the lead singer and\nguitarist, and the drummer, Graham,\nseem relaxed and ready to take on the\nworld. Of the other two members of the\nband, Jim, the guitarist is sitting with a group of friends and Eddie, the bass\nguitarist, is around somewhere!\nSwervedriver have only really been a band for eighteen months, but have\nknown each other for much longer.\nAdam, Jim and Eddie originally being in\na band called Shake Appeal. Graham was\nin his first band at 12 years old, at least,\none with real instruments. 'Before that,\nthe bands I was in played cricket bats!'\nHaving just finished a tour of Scotland,\nAdam described it as 'Alright, but\nknacker in g,I'm pleased it's over!'. They are currently on tour in the UK until\nDecember 15. Whilst travelling to one\ngig, Graham reveals, his boots were\nknocked off the lorry!\nSigned under Creation Records,\nSwervedriver have released two records\nto date, Son of Mustang Ford, their first\nsingle with which they did aUK tour and a four track EP, Ravedown, recorded in\nJune-July of this year. In six weeks they\nwill be back in the studio recording their\nalbum, and are then off to Holland.\nAll of their tracks have been written by\nAdam, although he admits they usually\ncome from a jamming session with the\nband. When asked how they would\ndescribe their music, having explained\nthat it has been described as hardcore-ish,\nAdam replied 'Well, I'd prefer to say it\nwas melodic al!'. Listing their influences as 'rock in\ngeneral', they were asked which gigs they\nwent to see. 'Anything with a good guitar\nsound, feedback' replied Graham. 'We've\nseen Killing Joke, Pixies'. 'We've seen\nCaptain Beefheart and Miss White Pope',\nadded Adam. Describing being compared to Dinosaur\nJr. as 'fair enough'. They were asked\nwhat they thought of the Manchester\nscene.\n'Well, I suppose Fools Gold was alright'\nreplied Adam 'but the rest is shit, and\nyou can quote that!'.\nOut on stage, Swervedriver, themselves\nwere definitely not shit, giving an\nawesome performance leaving many\nsuitably impressed.\nReturning backstage they were\nextremely modest about their\nperformance, with Eddie describing it as\n'Not as good as it could have been'.\nHaving rated their performance as 4/10,\nthey rated their enjoyment of the gig\n9/10. 'If you don't enjoy anything you do\nthen it's definitely not worth doing',\nstated Jim.\nAdam had referred to the bands name\nto 'being out of control'. Swervedriver are\nfar from being out of control, and should\nbe heading straight for the top.\nDJ.\nRave Down EP\nThis album is not for b aggies, but they're\nwelcome to buy it into the charts . In\nfact, Swervedriver are more of a Dinosaur Jnr meets My Bloody Valentine.\nThe result is a relaxing medley of roughly\nproduced guitar and extrovert harmonies\nwhich melt d elect ably under the drawling\nvocals.\nIt's still something that Ride do a lot\nbetter, but if you go for that raw, fuzzy\nsound, then these guys will be an instant\nhit.\nSJH\n\n"

So if\nyou are interested in wine come along\nand find out more.\nSki\nLast Saturday Trawsfynydd, North Wales,\nwas the venue for the 1990 England and\nWales Universities Ski Council dry ski\nslope championships, and so a team from\nIC Ski Club went up to compete. Friday\nnight, after a tour of London that would\nplease any American tourist, Kiera, our\ndriver, arrived with Daddy's meaty dr iv in' machine. In piles the five team members\nplus equipment, clothes, stoves etc,\ntogether with two UCL racers to make it\ncosy, and at 21.30 we left for Wales. We then went to Reading for an hour's coffee\nbreak and to pick up a Spitfire, renowned\nfor its air conditioning. The wet and cold\njourney turned into a drive through\nblizzards across the frozen wastes of\nNorth Wales until at 03.30 we were\nsomewhere near our destination. We soon\nrealised that not a lot was open, so we\ndrove into the the nearest woods so Kiera\ncould practice for the Lombard RAC rally.\nWe were joined at the ski slope, where\nwe were joined by about 130 other racers\nwho had had a good night. Still freezing\ncold and wet, the first individual slalom\ncourse was set and the racing got\nunderway as it started to snow again. The\nsecond run of the individual was run in\nreverse time order and Phil Wickens of IC\ntook 3rd overall. For the team event\nteams of five from each University\ncompeted in a relay. However,\nManchester made us a bit nervous, we\nwe joined forces with UCL to form three\nUL U mega teams. London C went into\naction, but because one of them hadn't waxed his head, they were defeated and\nconfined to the bar\u2014it was not all up to\nLondon A and B. Letting nothing stand in\ntheir paths, they flattened all their way\nuntil confronted by the Manchester team.\nThe semi-finals saw defeat for London B into bronze but London A fended off\nManchester in the final to claim gold. We could all ;:ow join London C in the bar.\nFencing\nUAU Preliminary Round\nIC-24 Kent-3\nIC-23 Surrey-4\nFollowing last year's overall victory the\nU AU tournament, expectations of a good\nresult received some justifications as IC\ntrounced both Kent and Surrey in the\nPreliminary Rounds. The team has almost\nentirely changed from last year.\nWe arrived bleary eyed and tired, only\nto be told that we would have to wait for\ntwo hours and that the organisers were\ncharging a \u00a322.50 entry fee to cover the\ncost of the sports hall. We queried this\nstrange procedure, since IC held the\npreliminary round last year free or\ncharge, and were firmly told what to do.\nThe foil team opened our account with\na solid 9-0 victory over Surrey. Simon\nLeight, Robert Pluim and Tom Howard looked in control throughout their bouts.\nThis changed somewhat in the following\nmatch against Kent when both Simon and\nRobert found the Kent 'secret weapon'\nsurprisingly difficult. Despite the\ninexperienced presiding bou th of them\nmanaged to win in the end giving IC\nanother 9-0 win. By this time the e pee is ts were keen to\nstart but had to wait as the sabre got\nunderway. None of the sabre team\nspecialised in sabre. However, Simon, one\nof the foil squad, Christ Quek and Justin\nMellor are fenced well to give IC an\nunbeatable score against Surrey. Chris\nand Justin then resumed the use of their\nfavoured weapon: the e pee and joined\nChrist Hu ch on in the e pee to give IC a final tally of 23 victories to 4 losses.\nThe day was wearing on and Justin had\nto go early after fencing all three of his\nsabre bouts consecutively. In a moment\nof pure genius, he looked at his opponent\nattack him feebly in the wrong line, said\n'you must be joking' in a clear loud voice\nand was immediately hit by a clean\nconcise renewal of attack. Everyone\ncracked up. Justin was undaunted and\nwon all three of his fights.\nFinally the day drew to a close with\nour e pee team winning again. Special\ncongratulations must go to Robert, Tom and Chris who survived the day without\nlosing a fight.\n33\n\n"

Copyright Felix 1990 ISSN 1040-0711.\nLetter from Cardiff\nDear Chris,\nRe: Issue 884 \"IC Rag in Dispute\".\nFurther to our telephone conversations\nof the 26th November concerning your\nintentions to print a detailed article as a follow up to the above piece, we would\nlike to clarify the following points:\n1. At no time has Rag Caerdydd or any\nmembers of its committee made\nallegations of theft or dishonesty amongst\nthe Executive of IC or IC Rag. We believe\nthat all the money raised on the day was\npassed on to Mencap. Such\nsensationalism s only serve to do harm to\nthe Rag accused and Rags nationally.\nShould any press outside the college press\nfollow up your article in issue 884, IC\nRag's reputation will be seriously tainted,\nand in such cases everybody loses,\nespecially the charities benefitting from\nthe good work IC Rag does.\n2. The letter sent by ourselves to one\nof your reporters, at his request, as a result of an incident which happened at\nIC, expressed only a chronological\naccount of this and other related incidents\nwhich have happened at IC for\nbackground information. It was marked\npersonal to the reporter in question since\nhe had offered his personal promise of\nconfidentiality. This was immediately\nbreached and the letter forwarded to IC\nRag apparently in the capacity of Rag Caerdydd. This has resulted in\ncorrespond ance from IC Rag to the\nreporter, a copy of which he forwarded\nto ourselves. These two breaches of\nconfidential mail serve no purpose other\nSTATEMENT\nthan inflaming an already tense situation,\nwith the two Rags were trying to resolve.\nOur Rag Chair is still awaiting a full\napology from IC Rag for the foolish\nbehaviour that occurred on the 3rd November, which resulted in severe\ntrauma and discomfort to her on the\nnight and for the following week. We also\nfeel that an admission of wrongful\npractice on the part of the reporter and\nan unreserved apology for the breach of\nconfidence to both Cardiff and Imperial\nCollege Rags be printed in \"Felix\".\nBeyond that we feel the place for\nresolving the rest of the disagreements is\nin private and not through the media.\nRag Caerdydd Committee.\nThe Manager and the Chairman of IC Rag in no way agree that the allegations made in the above letter about the reporter have\nany foundation. He did not commit any breach of confidence and is not guilty of any wrongful practice.\n43\n\n"

    "content": "LETTERS\nEaldorman\nDear Chris,\nHere we go again\u2014another Alan Bailey\nepic only slightly more literate this time. 1\nam glad to know that Alan has got some\nqualifications in History\u2014he does a very\ngood job of hiding it. In order to shorten\nmy letter this time:\n1. 'The person to blame for Hiroshima\nand Nagasaki is Hirohito'\u2014patent rubbish.\nThe atomic bombings of these two towns\nwere nothing to do with Pearl Harbour\ndirectly. I deplore the pre-em pti ve strike\nmade by the Japanese on the Harbour\u2014I think Alan and I could agree on this one.\nThis did exacerbate the Pacific situation\nleading up to the Pacific War, however, it\nis widely accepted that at the time of the\nbombing that the American forces were\none step away from defeating Japan\nwhich was shattered and reeking with\nself-inflicted (read that one carefully,\nAlan) wounds after its many military\nexploits in China and Korea. However, in\ncommon with so much American policy\nbefore and since, the Truman administration could not resist\ndemonstrating its technological superiority\nand going for the big one. It had a new\ntoy and was itching to use it\u2014twice. Go\nto the 'Peace Demo'(?? \u2014TS) or the\n'Heiwakoam' in Hiroshima and you will\nsee the result. Unnecessary overkill, when\nthe Americans (and probably the\nJapanese) knew they were on the brink\nof the conventional victory.\n2. If Alan could be bothered to look it\nup, the modern name for Japan is\n'Ninon'. A small point, but important as it\nmarks a deliberate departure from the\nword 'Nippon' which was more widely in\nused in World War II and was considered\nto have aggressive and nationalistic\nconnotations.\n3. 'Hirohito was little'\u2014fair enough!\n4. Oh good grief\u2014do we have to go\ninto the row about Margaret Thatcher. I do not write this to provide argument\nand a cascade of letters but I think the\nThatcher years were an unmitigated\ndisaster for this country. 'Sensible' and\n'correct' are the two adjectives furthest\nfrom my mind. I could go on: Poll Tax,\n15% interest rates, 10.9% inflation, no\noriginal members from 'class of 7 9 ' ,\nworst unemployment ever in the early\neighties, more people on the bread line,\nfurther subservience to the USA...blah,\nblah, blah.\nAll that, a few tax cuts at the poorer\nsector's expense\u2014just add water for an\nimmediate illusion of well-being and\nanother four year sentence.\n5. The 'Hang Nelson Mandela' t shirt\nincident\u2014sorry Alan, I was wrongly\ninformed\u2014know the feeling?\n6. The bit about Hirohito leading the\nwork like nation\u2014re-read all the stuff\nabout the figurehead monarchy and his\nsubservience to the Diet, the Meiji\nrestoration and all that.\nI believe that the true role of the\nemperor can be elucidated by noting that\nthe only executive decision he ever made\nwas the one to accept Unconditional\nSurrender when the cabinet vote was\ntied. He effectively ended the war for\nJapan (the records still exist!).\n7. I do intend to leave College and\nenter the real world. I would like to\nknow Alan's experience that allows him\nto comment so freely\u2014an 'S' Level in\nModern History does not count. I hope to\nwork in Japan (surprise, surprise).\n8. 'Well I know that I'm more in tune\nwith the British pop ul tion than you.'\nGod help us (I mean it sincerely). The cry\nof the truly isolated, the cry of Margaret,\nwhat was her name? All I can say is\u2014I hope not. Judging from the wave of\nletters against you Alan I would say not.\nThere are a few who you are in touch\nwith. Norman, um, what was the name?\nA straw poll on the street would show\nthe folly of your unsubstantial\nEarache\nDear FELIX,\nWhen I pointed out the supposed aim of\nthe Cultural Revolution, according to\nwhat Mao said: the empowerment of\nordinary people, I avoided trying to\nsummarise what really went on, or what\nMao's real aim was, because Iam too\nignorant. It would not surprise me to\ndiscover that corrupt Party and State\nofficials and other bullies used it as an\nopportunity to impose hare-brained\nschemes and persecute their opponents,\nsupposed enemies of the people, when they themselves were the real enemies of\nthe people (as one faction proved later by\nmassacring pro-democracy protesters in\nTiananmen Square) and Mao protected\nthem from being exposed.\nMing Ri may have attributed to me, the\nidea that the State should control\neverything. No, the State should not exist.\nAn alternative is a world without rulers,\nwhere people organise themselves and\ntheir resources on the basis of freedom\nand equality. This Communist vision is as\nmuch at odds with so-called Communist\ndictatorships as with the market system.\nThese dictatorships are unnecessary,\nexploitative, parasitic and oppressive.\nThey are Capitalist. President Bush\nsupports the current regime in China, and\nmany oppressive regimes in the world\nthat rule in the name of anti-communism.\nAs they were being gunned down, many\nprotesters in Tiananmen Square were\nsinging 'The Internationale'. Survivors\ncompared Deng Xiaoping to Hitler.\nIn Britain the Left has burdened the\nstate with a duty to provide health,\nargument\u2014I give it scant attention.\n9. ' My letter was not racist'\u2014if true\nthen I think a few lessons in writing style\nare in order, you misrepresented yourself\nvery badly. I think it's not true. This is\nbased on my research\u2014try doing some\nyourself, starting with your classmates.\n10) 'Condescending', 'Stuck up',\n'Isolated'\u2014hmmm. I'm willing to consider\ncriticisms. The only reason I'm not hurt is\nbecause they come from someone whose\nopinion I do not value at all and who,\nalthough I haven't met, feel that I 've\nknown for too long.\nIf condescending, stuck and isolated are\nused to describe a( hopefully) informed\nand considered reply and a widely held\nview then I plead guilty especially if they\nare used to describe a viewpoint far\nremoved from his.\nI expect there will be a reply\u2014get your\ncrayons out Alan. Yours,\nM Salter, Chem PG1,\nwelfare and good education for all. The\nCapitalists oppose this and see it as a waste of money. Police here use violence\nto break up peaceful demonstrations, but\nthanks to generations of struggle by left-wing activists, the rules here dare not go\nas far as their Chinese counterparts for\nfear of a backlash that could sweep them\nfrom power. The Economic League keeps\na secret and illegal blacklist of suspected\nleft wing activists, to spoil our job\nopportunities. The Right keeps\ncampaigning to extend the Obscene\nPublications Act, to make publication of\noffensive letters like mine punishable by\njail, and to tighten their grip on the mass\nmedia which have the power to distort\nour feelings, beliefs and memories.\nThe ideas and hard work of leaders can\nbe very valuable, but when someone\nbecomes a ruler (eg. in political or\neconomic lives) they come to serve an\naddiction to power and flattery. We should think honestly and logically for\nourselves and get rid of rulers.\nMany people who value freedom of\nspeech, resent its use by people with\nunconventional views, and take a vicarious pleasure in their persecution in\nother countries. But without those who\ninsist on speaking out, and the much\nbraver and more dedicated heroes who\nactively fight oppression, that freedom\nwould disappear. Moderation only gives\nthe oppressors more chances to murder\npeople.\nYours sincerely,\nJason Pike.\n\n"

    "content": "Football\nCharing X2 nds \u20142IC4 th s4 The 4th s got back to their winning ways\nwith an easy victory over the bottom\nplaced team. After missing several great\nchances as usual, Kev McCann latched on\nto a perfect through ball and gracefully\nlobbed the keeper to open the scoring.\nSeveral more great chances were missed\nand so IC began the second half feeling\nfrustrated.\nThings then began to get silly as the\nopposition actually equalise d and even\nstarted playing better, but IC responded\nimmediately with a superb move when a fine run and cross by Darren was well\nfinished by Lee Davis. With about ten\nminutes left, a goal mouth scramble led to\none of their players generously slicing the\nball into his own net, but then, moments\nlater, most of our players generously let\nthem prance up the pitch and slice it into\nour net. At last the game was made safe\nwhen, in an excellent build-up, John\nMottashed brilliantly headed home an\nim spire d cross from Damon Thomas.\nMen's Basketball\nIC-66 Middlesex Poly-61\nOn Wednesday 21 November IC Men's Basketball Team played their first game\nof the London College's League against\nMiddlesex Polytechnic. After much\ndifficulty in arranging the fixture, IC\nagreed to play at Trent Park, forfeiting\ntheir right to a home game.\nAfter a shakey start, IC called a time-out minutes from the end of the first half.\nThey were fourteen points behind and\nneeded to rally the flagging troops. Brad\nset them the achievable goal of pulling\nback four points by half-time. The team\nmanaged this and the scores stood at\n20-30 when they started back onto the\ncourt for the second half. A brave and\nslick performance allowed IC to draw\n53-53 when time was called. Good\ndefensive play had reduced Middlesex's scoring and clever offense had frustrated\na team which saw easy victory slip away\nfrom them.\nThe first five minutes of extra time\nfailed to decide the game. Middlesex\nplayed well but a well-timed three pointer\nfrom Marios enabled IC to hold them\n60-60.\nMarios opened a further period of extra\ntime by sinking another excellent three\npointer for IC. Middlesex were unable to\nrecover their composure and failed to\nscore again in open play. At6661 the\nhorn sounded for the last time.\nLadies' Football\nDribblers\u20142 Others\u20140\nThe triumphant Dribblers reasserted\nthemselves as the best piss heads in the\nleague by winning 2 boat races in short\nsuccession. Both London Hospital's football team and Liverpool hockey team\nwere devastated by the awesome\ndrinking power of the mighty Dribblers.\nThese super victories were aided by the\nabsence of Gert, the usual handicap of\nthe team.\nMuch of these victories can be\nattributed to the presence of old hands\n(notably the star keeper).\nNina Gascoigne was heard to say later:\n'AH I have to say is shit'\u2014that\ntremendous creature of a girl (the Viking)\nis one huge bitch!!!'\nIn accordance with old times, the\nDribblers, forfeited their leading role in\nthe leave table (it was getting a bit\nboring) to lose 2-3 to the London Leopards. (None of which was the fault of\nthe amazing goal keeper Emma 'She must\nbe related to Billy the Fish' Simpson. Nina\nGascoigne would like to finish off by\nextending a warm thanks to Permi and\nDebbie for assigning her to the Viking the\nentire f*** ing game.\nSailing\nIC vs Brunei & City Univs.\nAfter a late (?) start on Saturday morning\nand with more than our normal quota of\nteam members our team set off to Queen\nMary Reservoir, home of City University\nSailing Club. Despite certain delays on the\nway the IC team arrived well before our\nhosts and were forced to wait in the bar.\nFinally City and Brunei turned up and\nwe set about sailing a few races, although\nsome wind would have been helpful.\nDespite some terrible starting and\nunfamiliar boats the first race against\nBrunei was very close (normally Brunei\nare out of sight) IC losing by 3\nA point.\nThe second race was close but\nunfortunately not close enough.\nAgainst City, however, the IC boats\ndominated from the start cruising to a1st,2n d and 4th victory in the first race\nand in the second IC pulled through again\nto win the 1st,3 rd and 5th giving a few\npenalties (Green's) on the way.\nFinal Result\nIC vs City\nIC-6: l/4 City14 IC\u201411 City14 IC vs Brunei\nIC\u201412% Brunei12 IC\u201412 Brunel-73\n/4\nYacht\n30 to 40 knots of wind and high seas on\nthe South coast the weekend of 24th and\n25th November, ideal conditions for the\nFirst Class Europe chartered by IC Yacht\nClub for the Hamble Winter Series.\nAfter a few rough weekends our boat,\nNot Us, was finally set to achieve good\nresults.\nFirst on the water (in our class, 8th out\nof 130 overall), taking the winner's gun,\nbut second on handicap p, surfing with\nspeeds up to 151/2 knots on a reach, this\n37-foot ultra fast displacement boat left\nmany one-to nner s looking very slow and\nthreatened the two-to nner s. Continued solid performance will give a good overall standing.\nCross Country\nPrimed and buoyed by some recent\nmurderous hill training, IC dealt a mortal\nblow to the hope's of London's less pithy\ncolleges with another admirable display\nof athletic endeavour on the desolate\nwastelands of Wimbledon Common. Indeed we witnessed an historic moment\nas Imperial runners claimed individual\nglory in both men's and women's races.As her long-time leader succumbed\nto the strenuous challenge of the final\nhills, Edwige Pitel ousted her competitor\nin the final stretch. She thus became the\nfirst woman from this college ever to win a league race: a truly awesome\nachievement. In the men's event, a frantic\nearly pace backfired on the leaders, and\nin third place with less than a mile left,\nPaul Northrop cut a sad and disconsolate\nfigure. Yet his re known ed warrior spirit\nresurfaced, and with a final gut-wrenching\neffort he caught his rivals on the line, to\nextend his winning streak on a photo-finish. After showing well early on Frank\nDudbridge let the better men go, content\nto equal his highest placing of fifth, while\nBill Skailes finally showed a modicum of\ncompetence to make 17th. With Carl\nEdwards 38th, there was a three-way\nbattle for the final first-team place. Jim\nWatson (52nd) got the better of Dave\nBudgett right at the end, with Dunx\nO 'Dell worse for wear after an altercation\nwith a tube ticket gate, improving to\n59th. We have finished the first half of\nthe season with a comfortable 100 point\nmargin over the nearest pretenders.\n\n"

    "content": "Chris Riley tells a Christmas tale of massacre and corruption...\nPining For The Fjords ENVIRO\nChristmas - catastrophe for Conifers?\nAre native woodlands being bulldozed to\nmake way for Christmas tree plantations\nor is it just another crop? Chris Riley\ninvestigates.\nWhat would Christmas be without that\nglowing, tinsel clad Norway Spruce or\nDouglas Pine slowly dying in the corner?\nMany now make a habit of buying trees\nwith roots intact, but even this doesn't guarantee the survival of the plant.\nSince the dinosaurs roamed the earth,\nconifer plants have carpeted hillsides, but\ntoday, vast tracts of coniferous woodland\nare being felled for timber, the\nconstruction industry and the paper\nindustry.\nThe amount of timber consumed world\nwide each year would fill the Atlantic\nOcean twice. Forestry is big business; the\naverage citizen of the northern\nhemisphere uses well over 150kg or over\ntwice their body weight of paper every\nyear. Britain alone gets through well over\n50 million tonnes of paper each year.\nThis is the equivalent of nearly seven\nyears of continuous photocopying! Over\nthree quarters of this comes from\nsoftwood trees like conifers. The third\nworld uses about one third of this, but is\non the increase.\nIn the past, felled trees were frequently\nreplaced by single species plantations.\nThey were often non-native and planted\nfor their economic potential rather than\nfor any ecological considerations. Today,\nthe forestry commission follows strict\nplanting regulations. A diversity of species\nare planted and the edge of the\nplantation is made to look as natural as\npossible by using species with different\ngrowth rates to produce trees of differing\nheights. Tree spacing is also increased\ntowards the outside of the plantation.\nOpponents of plantations still argue that\nwith this increase in quantity of trees\nplanted, the delicate balance of the\nforests is being upset. Ground is ploughed\nor ripped up and fertilizers are applied.\nThe drainage pattern and soil chemistry\nis altered, causing increases in sediment\nand nutrient loads on rivers, and harm to\nfreshwater fish.\nCurrently Britain only has around\n15,000 hectares of coniferous forest\n(about the size of the City of London).\nAlthough 25,000 hectares of new forest\nare planted each year we still have to\nspend \u00a37 billion a year importing 90% of\nour wood. Most of this comes from\nScandinavia and Russia where forestry\npractice is not as strict. Hundreds of\nforest species are disappearing and many\nwill be endangered in a few years.\nThe government tries to correct this\nshortage by offering tax incentives to\nlandowners who devote land use to\nplantations. Within Scotland, where there\nare already 1,000 hectares of forest,\npopular musicians such as Chaz and\nUp in lights: the Trafalgar\nSquare tree donated by\nNorway.\nDave, and Ian Anderson, of Jethro Tull\nfame, have taken up generous\nGovernment tax concessions to establish\nlarge plantations.\nDespite such planting programmes, the\nwood deficiency still exists. Many young\ntrees are fatally damaged by sheep, deer\nand the effect of acid rain. The latter has\nreceded from the public eye with the\nincreases in awareness of global warming and ozone depletion. Unlike deciduous\ntrees, conifers are particularly susceptible\nto acid rain. With their long lasting\nfoliage they are unable to shed toxins in\nthe autumn. Around64% of Britain's trees show the effect of acid rain.\nBut what of Christmas trees? It seems\nthat these little green clones are just\nanother crop, grown on open land that\nwould otherwise be used for arable land.\nNo forests are cut down to make way for\nChristmas trees. All trees sold are\nbetween four and ten years old. By\nharvesting at this age, farmers argue that\nthe crop is photosynthetic ally more\nactive, using more carbon dioxide and\nproducing more oxygen - good for\neveryone.\nHow 'Green' is that 'GreenCard'?\nTo cash in on the new environmentally\naware public, this Christmas the BCC card\ncentre have introduced their 'GreenCard'.\nPredictably, the card is decorated with a globe and is presumably green. It is\nbacked up by Visa and Master Card and\nis therefore accepted in 7 million outlets\nworld wide. BCC advertise that funds\ngenerated from the use of the card go\ntowards charities that help endangered\nspecies, pollution of seas and rivers or\ndestruction of the rainforests. Two pictures show the Christmas lights in\nOxford Street and a wildlife scene. The\ncaption beneath reads 'GreenCard'\nwelcomed here and here.\nThe prospective customer has a choice\nof interest rates. If they opt to pay an\nannual fee of \u00a3 6 then the rate is 1.9%.\nAlternatively if you are one of these\npeople who always pays their bills on\ntime, then you can waive the annual fee\nand opt for a higher interest rate of 2.1%.\nThe card reportedly donates money to\nover ten charities; not only world\nenvironmental organisations but also\norganisations like 'Care of Britain'.\nSo how much money actually goes to\nthese charities? It turns out that for every\n\u00a3 1 0 0 you spend using the card, BCC donate 30p to be shared out between the\nten organisations. That works out at the\ngenerous amount of 0.33%! However BCC do stress that if you introduce a friend to\nthe card, then they donate \u00a3 5 . So with\nsuch goodwill how do they still manage\nto make a profit? Like all other credit\ncards they rely on the bad financial\nmanagement of their customers,\nconsumer temptations and over spending.\n\n"

    "content": "Graeme Shan interviews..\nThe Shamen\nFor those of you who don't know of the\nShamen, they're shit hot. Simple as that.\nThere's much more than an element of\ntruth in the now widespread belief that\nthey, more than anyone else have their\nfinger on the biggest pulse of club music\ntoday.\nThere are only two human members of\nthe Shamen, Colin and Will, though the\ntechnology could be classed as a worthy\nthird party. Credited with being the first\nband to make the indie dance crossover\nback in 1988, their music is now almost\ntotally house, but with a melodic feel.\n'We came down to London in, what,\nMay 1988...We're from Aberdeen and had\nheard some tapes with the early house\nsounds from down here, the scene up\nthere is non-existent so we had to come\ndown.'\nIt was at this time that The Shamen\nproduced Transcendental, their first\nexperiment in acid house. An album\nfollowed (In Gorbachev We Trust), a mixture of rhythmic indie tracks and their\nnew acid influences. A remix of\nTranscendental with Chicago house king\nBam Bam received limited play in the\nclubs, but still their indie label lingered\nprejudicing club dj's. A further step was\nevident in the next aptly named LP Phoreward, featuring tracks remixed by hot dj Evil Eddy Richards (he played\nImperial College at New Year's Party).\nHowever, their journey was not complete\nuntil the release of the new album En-tact\nlast month. Acceptance finally came with\nit a whole host of addictive ly dancy\ntracks. 'With all respect, the reason we\nweren't accepted was that we weren't good enough!'\nThis could be true. En-tact is certainly\nthe most professional package to come\nfrom The Shamen. The production is\nsuperb. Presented as a2 x12\" to\nimprove quality and aid mixing between\nturntables, it's fully geared for clubs and\nhome dj's. Hyperreal will be the next single\nreleased from En-tact. 'Hyperreal is my favourite...because of the way it came\ntogether. Originally 1 had done the track\nas an instrumental and then two days\nbefore I was due to take it into the studio\nI got this demo tape of Plauka...I'd been\nwaiting for it for months...it was a bad\ndemo but there was obviously vocal\nquality there...I wrote her some vocal\nlines that night, recorded and sampled\nthem next day...'\nColin explained the One Little Indian\ndeal...'We wanted to continue doing the\nSynergy thing...financially it wasn't as\nsecure as the majors' offers but they (One\nLittle Indian) were more interested in\nwhat The Shamen are about long term.'\n'We want to get into the Top 40; to get\na US deal. They won't give you a deal\nunless you've been in the Top\n40...Obviously I'm more pleased that\nwe're highly regarded in the clubs, but\nwe do need to break into the US\nmarket...' After all, you have to feed\nyourself?'...\n'Well, we sell enough albums to do that\nbut, actually it's the first time I haven't lived in a squat in London. I have a flat\nnow!'\nIn wondered if Colin had any opinions\nabout the end of the house scene, the\nnext stage...\n'I think the basic acid beats are here to\nstay now, it's just what you lay over\nthem. Samplers and sequencers are the\ninstruments of the future...I can't understand the amount of techno-fear\nsome people have, especially\ndrummers...drum machines only make\ntheir job easier.'\nSo what is Synergy. Colin provides a definition...\n'It's a word meaning when you get\nmore energy out of the combination of\ntwo things...than (the sum of) the energies\nof the two things themselves. That could\nbe a combination of two drugs, or music\nand lights, or music and audience\nparticipation.'\nThis relates to what the Synergy club\nconcept is. The Shamen take a whole\nclub on tour\u2014dj's, mc's, lights, projectors\nplus numerous other acts to produce a physically astonishing night. They play a set themselves though the dancing doesn't stop and they're mixed in and out, on\nbeat, like any other tracks played.\nNothing stops until after 2am when all\nthe happy people either wind down or\ntramp off to some party somewhere.\nLast Saturday, The Shamen visited the\nLondon Rocket Club to convert a few\nmore Londoners to the joys of Synergy.\nCompetition for tickets was harsh\u2014they\noversold the venue by 400 (at the time I interviewed Colin, it was still not clear\nwhether the doors would be opened at\nall, for fear of licensing laws and fire\nrisk). People had come from every wh re, even as far afield as Scotland, and were\nnoticeably more like r avers than the\naudience at last year's Shamen gigs.\nThe extent to which Synergy attempts\nto create something new is shown by\nsuch things as 'The Mind Gym'. Some sort\nof electronic headgear/goggles is worn,\nand the eyes closed. Pulses of light and\nsound bombard the brain, separating and\nde phasing each side to make the wearer\nfeel like his body experiences some sort\nof meta morph os as is. I am told a15 minute session costs \u00a3 1 5 at 'The Brain'\nclinic, but here at Synergy it's free to\nanyone who queues up. One of the\npeople running the brain machine was a65 year-old woman, dressed in silver rave\nwear, totally off her head, grooving down to acid house\u2014brilliant.\nThe Shamen set was fantastic, the high-point being Make it Mine, during which\nthe the energy in the audience soared to\na peak. This is ironic since it is the only\ntrack with a guitar riff...\n'1 was messing one day on the guitar\nand came up with this riff. I thought it\nsounded just like those heavy rock riffs\nfrom the seventies...I wanted it to sound\nlike a sample from one of them.'\nColin has been known to attribute a lot\nof his music to the feelings he's had from\ndrug experiences...\n'Drugs have always been associated\nwith music...always...The Pogues is\nwhisky music. Our's isn't, that's all'.\nRe students:\nT did that once...most respectable way of being unemployed!'\nTechnical Bit\nShamen use a Steinberg Cubase and aC lab\nMidi Package both run on Atari ST.\n\n"

That's how\nlong it took St Georges to realise that the\nreferee was 'soft' and inexperienced and\nthat they could get away with murder. So\nthey spent the next 45 minutes kicking IC\nout of the game. They also tried in the\nlast half hour but largely failed as IC took\nthe 'footballing piss' as some semblance\nof calm had been restored by the\npresence of St John's Ambulance men on\nthe touch line. St George's cynically\nprofessional game gave them a lead by\nintimidation and IC a very injured\ngoalkeeper. Two excellent goals by MAb do were sadly not enough. IC will\neasily outclass them in the return but we\nneed a hard man to give the game a 'calming' influence to allow us to play on\nequal terms. All welcome!!\nUAU Hockey\nLSE-0 IC-1\nThe whole team knew the importance of\nthis match with regard to life in the U AU. A win was the only result that would\nallow IC to proceed to the next stage of\nthe competition. With this in mind, IC\nwent hard at LSE in the first few minutes,\nusing such score-tactics as undercutting\nthe ball at their opposite numbers. Some\ngood midfield play enabled IC to open up\nmany gaps, but a mixture of bad luck and\na worse pitch allowed LSE off the hook\nand at half time the score was 0-0.\nRealising that they were nevertheless the\nbetter team, Imperial continued where\nthey had left off, Lavercombe and\nGreenwood pretty much untroubled at\nthe back, allowing more and more\npenetration up front as IC piled on the\npressure. But then disaster struck and a, yet to be identified, person conceded a penalty strike. This proved to be keeper\nSteve Dodson's only test of the day, and\nfaced with his first strike of the season,\nhe managed to psych-out the taker,\nforcing him to push it wide. This sudden\nshock jolted Imperial into a higher gear,\nand almost immediately they gained a short corner. Portsmouth pushed out,\nGreenwood stopped and Landon struck\nhome after his first shot rebounded off\nthe keeper. 1-0 up, Imperial held on for\nthe last 15 minutes, with both Marshall\nand Wright going close. IC qualify for the\nplay-off stage.\nWater Polo\nOn Wednesday 28th November Imperial\nCollege played a very close and exciting\nfriendly against the more experienced\nCharing Cross squad. Despite losing 8-9\nour team played well, beginning to show\nthe fruits of the recent training\nprogramme.\nThe U AU qualifiers are on December 8\nand we should win through to the finals.\nWe have two more friendly games, on\nDecember 2 and 6 against Cambridge and\nthe University of London to prepare for\nthe Championships.\nFor those who are interested we swim\nfrom 6.30pm on Mondays and Fridays\nand more swimmers are always welcome.\nWe play water polo throughout the year\nin the Middlesex League.\nHockey\nLSE 2nds0 IC 2nds8 Wednesday 28th November saw the\nreturn to form of the IC 2nds as they\nshowed that they had perhaps the best\nchance in the U AU of any of the IC\nteams, with the annihilation of an LSE team, previously only beaten by a margin\nof just two goals by the other teams in\nthe group.\nWith just a few minutes gone, IC took\nthe lead with a well timed goal from Ian\nMcGovern. This led to a team spirit,\npreviously unseen this season, that piled\non the pressure against LSE who never\nlooked like scoring throughout the whole\ngame! Short corner after short corner\nwere awarded to IC by our umpire, but\nto no avail until Ian and John Blanshard\nrealised that a pass to the right was in\norder for Dave Millard to power in his\nsecond goal of the season. More pressure\nled to another short corner, actually\nstruck on target by John and getting a crafty deflection on the way to make it\n3-0 to IC going into half time.\nNot even the digging up of the pitch by\nthe LSE farmers could stop the onslaught\nfrom getting worse in the second half as\nDom Howe stepped up a gear to put\nanother goal in. Then came goals galore\n' as many a scramble in the LSE circle led\nto Ian and Dom getting their second and\nMa Nog Tseung scoring with a particularly bad square cut into their goal.\nJohn Church popped up (again) to get his\n8th of the season, and there wasn't time\nenough to make it more than 8-0.\nNow the seconds face a really long\nroad trip to Reading for the next round.\nULU League\nIC VI-6 KCH3-1\nIC 6th s faced the only other unbeaten\nside in their division on Saturday but\nwere nearly beaten by the journey before\neven reaching the ground. Two trains, a tube and a bus were needed as the\ncaptain did his best to get the whole\nteam lost.\nOn arriving at the ground they found a side of giants but undeterred Andy Briscoe and Dave Phillips soon got stuck\ninto some fierce tackles. IC played well in\nthe hard fought opening stages and the\ninevitable first goal came from Keith\nCordeiro bamboozling the opposition with\nhis lightening pace. Akio Iwase made it\n2-0 to IC while K CH, who battled well in\nmidfield, were allowed few chances by\nthe IC defence. Two superb goals by\nAndrew Stanniland (who surprised\nhimself, not to mention the rest of the\nteam) and another each from Keith and\nAkio left K CH dead and burried. A single\nconsolation goal was all they could\nmanage and so the 6th s go storming on\nwith a little help from special guest\nRakesh Muthoo.\nHockey\nIC 3rds2 IC 2nds \u20144\nLate on Saturday 24th November\nafternoon, the two most successful\nhockey teams at IC marched out for the\ngrudge match of the year, both teams\ncertain of victory.\nAbout 30 seconds from the start, Dom Howard of the 2nds found himself in\nspace, and put away the first goal of the\ngame. The 3rds immediately rallied and\nequalise d with a good goal form Nic\nParfitt. The ball then stayed near the\n2nds goal for the rest of the half, with\nSteve Hamilton taking the score to 2-1 to\nthe 3rds. A major blow to the 3rds was\nthe loss of Gary De Sonza after 20\nminutes with a fractured ankle.\nThe second half saw the 2nds taking\nfull advantage of the extra space, Ian\nMcGover n putting away a good goal,\nshortly after the re-start. Sadly, Justin\nHoldsworth collided with a raised stick\nand spent about 10 minutes having a cut\neye checked. Now two players down, the\n3rds were under pressure, and McGover n exploited the situation by sneaking one in\nfor the lead. The final blow was a superb\nMillard score during a temporary collapse\nof the 3rds excellent defence.\n\n"

    "content": "IPear Sir\nEagle\nDear Chris,\nIt is surprising asking around College\nhow few undergraduates at Imperial seem\nto have applied for any electricity shares.\nHere are three reasons I have heard from\nthree different people.\ni)I couldn't be bothered.\nii) I don't bele ive the Government should\nsell off the industry. Iam against the\nprinciple.\niii) I don't want to risk any of my savings.\nTo which I answered:\ni) You could be bothered to work 60 hour\nweeks during the summer cleaning toilets\nat \u00a32.92 an hour so why not fill in this\nform, attach a \u00a31,200 cheque and wait for\nan early xmas gift of at least \u00a3 1 5 0 and all\nfor 15 minutes work.\nii) Iam against the principle, however the\nsell-off will go ahead regardless, besides\nsurely a more important principle is that\nby applying for shares you will deny Mr Loadsamoney in Chelsea of shares.\niii) Any investment in shares involves\nrisk, however if you study the accounts of\nthe RECs (Regional Electricity Companies)\nand the multitude of circumstances\nbehind this floatation (City Institutions\nwith high liquidity 'problems' etc etc) you\nsoon begin to realise it is riskier leaving\nyour money in a building society. The\nonly way you will lose money is if World War Three breaks out one minute into\nofficial dealings in the shares (in which\ncase there would be no point having\nmoney anyway) or if you apply for too\nmany shares in each REC( in which case\nyou might lose more interest in your\nmoney than capital gains from the shares\nyou obtain because of anticipated heavy\n'scaling down').\nLet's be realistic by splitting \u00a31,200 into\n\u00a3100 applications in each REC it will be\nvirtually impossible to lose in the short\nterm even after dealing costs. Even\nstudents with no savings could have\nmade money by getting a student loan,\napplying for shares with the money,\nselling the shares straightaway and then\nrepaying the loan early. For a College\nwith such a right-wing reputation it is\nsurprising how how un enterprising many\nof its students seem to be.\nThis was a golden opportunity to make\nmoney, golden opportunities do not grow '\non trees.\nYours sincerely,\nMark Whiting, Physics 3.\nEagre\nDear Sir,\nAre there any pros to religion? I don't think so. Just an awful lot of cons.\nIt was sad to observe in last week's article on religion, the complete\nmisunderstanding about what true\nChristianity is all about. I have to say\n'true' Christianity has nothing to do with\nHinduism, Islam, or Buddhism. It also has\nnothing to do with Roman Catholicism or\nwhat the majority of the Church of\nEngland churches are telling us.\nSo, why is true Christianity any\ndifferent? Well, it is not religion.\nEveryone is telling us that we must try\nLETTERS\nour best to please God and then we will\nbe getting somewhere with him; check\nout all the religions on offer. Only true\nChristianity is saying something especially\ndifferent. In fact, it is saying that you\ncan't please God, it stands alone.\nReligion is summed up by the words:\nceremony, display and formalism. It\nchanges the outwards appearance,\nmaybe, but peoples' hearts are still the\nsame. Mankind is inherently bad, or\nsinful. You don't accept that? Wake up.\nTake a look around. Religions are trying\nto deal with this problem at the 'effect'\nend of things instead of at the 'cause'\nend. No wonder religion is hypocritical.\nTrue Christianity is not about rules and\nceremonies dealing with effects. It is\nabout supernatural power to deal with\nthe cause\u2014man's inherent sinfulness. It is\nabout what god thinks, written in the\nBible. It is about God, who is angry with\nsin because he is a God of justice. It's about the reality that everyone has\nbroken God's Law. Everyone has sinned.\nIt's about being regenerated\u2014or born\nagain\u2014by God and having God living in you. Many people in this College will\ntestify to this. It's their own experience.\nLives are transformed. You get right with\nGod not by things you do, but by what\nGod has done for you. This is where true\nChristianity stands alone. 'Doing good'\nhas to be pre cee ded by being 'born\nagain'. The cause must be dealt with\nbefore the effects.\nThis letter is one of information. Now that you have the information you can\ndecide on it. Choose to ignore it or\naccept it.\nTherefore, as God says, Choose Life.\nDavid R Kirk, Aero 4.\nSouthside Disco 8.30pm Southside Bar.\nICCAG Soup Run 9.15pm Meet Weeks Hall Basement to take food to\nLondon's homeless.\nFRIDAY\nHang Gliding 12.30pm Southside Upper Lounge.

    "content": "FELIX\nThe facts of life: how each week's baby is produced.\nBy Roland Flowerdew.\nFelix on Felix News in action; the stories unfold\nFelix, unlike certain other student\npublications, is not produced by three\nhacks and a photocopier, nor is it written\ninternally then given to a commercial\nnewspaper printer to publish. Felix is\nwritten, typeset, pasted-up, printed and\ncollated entirely in house. About the only\ntime when external printing is needed is\neither in an emergency (the press breaks\ndown) or when full colour is required.\nThree full-time staff are employed to\nproduce Felix, although this is not the\nonly thing they do: the print unit is used\nby other publications, generating revenue\nthat sub sid is es your issue. Two of the\nstaff are permanent (the typesetter and\nthe printer) while the third, the editor, is\nelected every year on the same basis as\nthe other sabbaticals. This year the\nsituation is slightly different because we\nhave a print unit manager, and a non-sabbatical editor.\nThe rest of the Felix staff are students\nfrom all over college, and we are always\nhungry for more. Why do these people\ndevote a lot of their time to doing work\nover and above their courses? The best\nway to find out is to come and see for\nyourself: if you have any interest in\nphotography, writing, seeing films or\ntheatre, reviewing records, interviewing\n'famous' people, digging up the latest\nscandals, drinking coffee, all absolutely\nfree, come to Felix. The only catch is you\nwill be expected to write something...\nThere are six stages that any article\nprinted in Felix goes through: planning,\nwriting and photographing, typesetting,\npasting-up, printing, and collating. Most of\nthese stages run concurrently: a common misconception is that something the size\nof Felix can be produced overnight on\none press. A twenty page issue consists of\nten sides of A3 paper. The front cover is\nin two colours, so needs to be fed\nthrough the press twice. Around4000 copies are printed, thus a total of 44,000\nsides of A3 must be printed.\nThe initial planning for an edition of\nFelix takes place several weeks in\nadvance. Various press officers are\ncontacted, and review tickets for theatre\nand cinema and review copies of books\nand records requested. (Note: reviewers\nare often allowed to keep what they\nreview.) Ideas for features are beginning\nto germinate, and press releases come\nrolling in. Pages are booked for\nadvertisements, providing more money\ntowards your issue.\nThe reviews team is a large and\ndedicated group of people (they could\nalways do with a few more), covering a wide range of interests. Although the\nreviews side of Felix is often criticised\nand accused of merely copying reviews\nfrom other magazines this is NOT TRU Eall film reviews are of the preview\nshowing specially for critics. This term,\nfor example, we have reviewed 62.5% of\nall UK film releases during the term.\nReviews split into two main sections,\nmusic (non-classical) and arts (ie\neverything that music does not cover).\nBoth sections are the responsibility of a sub-editor, who coordinates who goes to\nsee what, and is responsible for ensuring\nthat their pages are ready for printing\neach week.\nFeatures consists of two sections,\nscience and general. Unlike reviews,\nfeatures do not have a team of people to\nproduce them. The science features\ndepend on contributions, mainly from\nexternal sources. Especially welcome are\nfeatures on interesting research at\nImperial College. (For those of you\nengaged in research, Felix is the ideal\nplace to present accounts of your work in\nthe language of laymen.) General features\nare usually on matters relevant to\nstudents, but anything of general interest\nis acceptable. (Any budding feature\nwriters out there? It looks good on your\nCV.)\nSections that are primarily written by\nyou are the clubs and sports pages and,\nof course, the infamous letters pages, the\nbit most people read first.

    "content": "Terminal Cheesecake\nHit\nEtc,\nThere's a very strange story on the back\nof this LP concerning aMr Dan Gane.\nThis is his story. Mr Gane is an ordinary\nguy who goes through what may best be\ndescribed as a 'mid-life crisis' and comes\nout of it hearing voices telling him to kill\npeople. The story gets quite disturbing\nuntil you pay attention to the people he\nkills\u2014Mary Graphite (student), Fred Perry\n(old man) and Henri Tombstone (priest)\namongst others. The tale was written by\na certain Nat Jerkoif. Hmmm. So to the record. I 've got no option but\nto tell it like it is I'm afraid I lost patience\nwith Terminal Cheesecake. They attempt\nserious songs but throw in samples and\nstupid little nursery rhyme beginnings.\nThey provide light relief from tracks\nGlitterhouse\nHailing from some far corner of the USA, Glitterhouse's Monstermagnet release\ntheir first LP, cunningly titled\nMonstermagnet. This is a harsh guitar\nalbum of five songs which on first\nhearing is a dire, dirty animal wallowing\nin its own excrement, with a carnal\ndesire to be sick in your face. This is a most laudable attitude (one Phil Collins\ncould take note of) no doubt learned from\nliving in some David Lynch type town in\nnowhere s ville. There's a raw no-nonsense energy that\npervades the album, very reminiscent of\nDinosaur Jr, but lacking his effortless\nvocal style. Still peel back the surface\nlayers and you'll find some breakneck\ntunes running through the album (more\napparent on the quiet(er) Freak Shop\nUSA. As much feedback and grunge as\nThe Fall\nLou Reed once said of himself, 'I can't sing, I can only reach a few notes'. This\nis a noble confession, one we all know,\nbut nevertheless it takes a brave man to\nadmit it. The at on on al MarkE Smith\nknows he-can't sing. He delights in the\nfact. He also manages to write\nconsistently great songs with totally\ninnocuous titles ('British people in hot\nweather, pay your rates, big pizza).\nWithin these songs Smith vehemently\nspits out seemingly random words that\nmean nothing placed next to each other,\nbut when considered in the context of a song make a sort of jilted sense.\nEach song hangs on cleverly interjected\nphrases, repeated through his babble.\nJuxtapose this with an urgent guitar\nyou can take, with even the vocalist (dare\nI say singer) enthusiastic in this\nsound and the gospel according to Smith\nbecomes an essential, breathing sound.\nTranslated to a live format however\nand The Fall begin to fail. Brix's departure left a gaping hole in Smith's head, and the band's string section.\nNeither have completely recovered.\nSecondly. Smith has a xenophobic\nattitude towards his audience, frequently\nturning his back on them. Awry smile\npiercing his sour expression only once\nthis evening. For Christ's sake\u2014what's the\npoint of doing gigs if you're not going to\nenjoy them?\nSmith's nonsense-speak becomes a frustrating armour-plated screen. Nothing\ncan penetrate it. You can't fathom him\nout through the welter of sound. The Fall\nAngels in Pigtails LP\ncaked in grunge, but add nothing in\nthemselves. Oh, there's a Residents' cover\n(Hello Skinny) to let us know exactly\nwhere the band are coming from.\nIf 1 was feeling in a good mood I could\nglibly throw in a couple of pretentious\nreferences to Terminal Cheesecake\nplough the fields of Ciccone Youth's barren landscape. Sorry, couldn't resist.\nThey quite nicely use noise and silence\nby way of contrast, I suppose, and you\ncould blunt a knife on the vocals. My enthusiasm is almost carrying me away\nhere! This isn'ta good enough album to\nmake me turn up the volume to\nmaximum and stick my head in a speaker. So it's back to the drawing\nboard boys.\nJ DF. Monstermagnet LP\ndepartment too.\nIn fact, if he's not singing through what\nI presume is a megaphone, he's playing\nthe 'sing from the back of the recording\nstudio whilst the microphone's at the\nfront' game and I swear at one point the\nvocals are so far back in the track that\nhe's singing from outside, with the door\nclosed. Still, this purveys a sweet attitude\nto rock. Not to be called inconsistent, it's carried through to the back cover picture\nof one of those roll-your-own cigarettes.\nThis type of hardcore album isn't going to\nwin over any new fans, but it sounds like\nit was fun to make and an attitude rather\nthan ideas come across.\nThey definitely sound like an act to go\nand experience live, and on that basis I 'll\ngive them six out of ten on the monster\nscale.\nJ DF.

    "content": "John Finley's brief guide to how not to stay sober with style over\nChristmas for under six quid.\nDr Finley On The Case FELIX\nDr Finley's list of recommended wines\ncan be found opposite below.\n\u2014with apologies to Sir W.S. Gilbert, and\nalso to the vast majority of wine\nmerchants who mI have not consulted.\nMy not so little list is based entirely on Oddbins, with a few interlopers from\nSainsbury's, and very little recent\npractical research (alas). Many of the\nwines mentioned are to be found in other\nplaces. Chris asked me to do, in short\norder, a piece on wines for Christmas.\nThe result is entirely idiosyncratic, as I refuse to be held to a particular pattern,\nand you should be warned that I tend to\nvalue a definite taste above subtlety.\nThe list is arranged in categories and should be regarded as the vino us equivalent of a bibliography. There is\nmuch good drinking amongst them,\nthough some of the more powerful reds\nare perhaps 'more appropriate to the\nneeds of the advanced student'. I have,\nwith a few exceptions, kept to a price of\n\u00a35 or less, not unreasonable for a celebration, and, inevitably, have a fairly\nlavish Christmas Dinner in mind.\nEvery Christmas Dinner I have eaten\nhas arrived late, so we must have\nsomething to amuse the taste-buds to\nstart with. Manzanilla is the lightest of the\nsherries, but very dry\u2014safer, though,\nthan the usual Amontillados etc... Serve\ncool and finish within 10 days. Unless you\nare prepared to pay a lot more,\nSainsbury's is quite adequate. It will go\nwell with most 'cocktail snacks' of the\nsaltier kind. We are thinking of an\noccasion, though, and Bubbly restores the\nspirit. I have suggested three Aussies and\none Old World. 1 myself am not a passionate adherent of dry wines, and\nfind the slightly richer Angus more\nattractive than the Seaview. In particular,\nthe pink wine is terribly 'more ish '\u2014in my youth 1 would have thought it vulgar. The Blanquette is in many ways an old-fashioned wine with old-fashioned virtues\nand very much worth trying.\nWe then have to think of a first course\nwhich may not be there\u2014say smoked\nsalmon or fish in a fairly strong cream\nsauce. The Bubblies can carry on, or we can start on the White Burgundy\nsubstitutes. Nobody can afford the real\nthing. I have considered three types of\nwine. The classic grape is the\nChardonnay. The Australians make it\nheavy, and age it in oak (for however a short time). The result is, in general,\npretty robust. It will support a rich dish,\nand continue with a poultry roast. The Bulgarians produce a lighter wine which I find attractive, but possibly a contradiction of my predilection to a concentration of flavour. The Sauvignon\nwines are more acidic, with a definite\ngooseberry character. On the whole I think thema\u2014very pleasant\u2014let-out. They\nare very clean and would cover the\nrange from pre-Dinner to a turkey roast.\nThe Australian Rieslings are to me\ncuriosities\u2014they are not remotely like\ntheir German ancestors, which, in the\nreasonable price range, rely on lightness\nand scent, but are robust wines which,\nyet again, have been aged in oak. They\nwill provide a solid background to fish in\na sauce or the turkey main course and\nare slightly sweeter than the others.\nThe next major shift is to the red\nwines. I have again ruled out Burgundy,\non grounds of price, and the principal red\nBurgundy grape, the Pinot Noir, since it\ndoes not seem to prosper away from\nhome in the way that the Cabernet\nSauvignon does. My groupings here are\nthe Bordeaux-related grapes, Cabernet,\nCabernet-Franc and Merlot, the Rhone\nbased Syrah grape with some of its\nSouthern cousins, and a trio of 'others'.\nThe Cabernet tends to be tanni c, but in\nthe new World it is often a big fat wine\nin a way that the restricted climate of\nBordeaux does not allow (elegance be\nblowed). The Bulgarians have also\nproduced a range of wines, from the\nCabernet and its rival the Merlot, which it\nis very difficult to fault\u2014particularly at\nthe price. All these go well with turkey\nor with my preferred lamb, beef or game\nroasts. Of the individual wines I would\nsay little except that the Maitre\nd 'Estournel is a good classical Bordeaux,\nbut would appear thin by comparison\nwith the Aussies. Better for turkey or\nlamb than beef.\nMy own love here is the Syrah/Shiraz\ngrape\u2014definitely into lamb/beef/game\nterritory rather than poultry. The taste is\nnot so familiar in Britain, as commercial\npressures have tended to calm down the\ndefinite peppery quality of the taste in\ngeneric 'Cotes du Rhone' wines. It is\nsomething that the Australians seem to\nhave got instinctively and completely\nright, so much so that I welcome the\nutterly un classic Cabernet/Shiraz\nmixtures. These are wines for serious\nfood\u2014though I would be happy to have\nthe wine, even if not a perfect match,\nwith turkey (think of the burnt bacon and\nsausages which are usually there as\naccompaniments). Particularly interesting\nis Sainsbury's organic wine, which I have\nfound generally liked. The Guigal and the\nTaltarni are immense. Many of the others\nmay feel initially light on the tongue, but\nwill project all sorts of complicated tastes\ngiven a little time.\nAmongst the reds I finish with a small\nseductive group which I cannot claim to\nunderstand. I have listed two Portuguese\nwines by Joao Pires which do not fit into\nthe accepted patterns (try any of his\nothers). They seem to be light on the\ntongue but extremely flavourful\u2014but they\nare not light in alcohol. I find a family\nlikeness to port, without the weight.\nThere is also a lonely Italian of more\nobvious solid character with a spicy\nquality.\nThe only proper wine for Christmas\nPudding is sweet Champagne\u2014but this is\nnot only expensive, but very difficult to\nobtain since the decline of the Russian\nCourt. Asti Spumante will not do. My own feeling is that a sweet still wine of\nsufficient character works well with the\nrichness of the pudding, and that the\nclarity of the Chenin-based sweet wines of\nthe Loire have an advantage over the\nmore heavy bo try tis reliant wines of\nBordeaux. I have listed a very young\nwine from Sainsbury with the necessary\nweight, and a lighter, cheaper, wine from\nOddbins which might still prove\nrefreshing. These wines, even when old (I still hold the 59's and 64's), present a fresh original attack of a kind of which\nthe Bordeaux are incapable (though they\nmay seduce) and can lighten the heart at\nthe end of a lengthy meal. (If you see a Moulin de Touchais or a Clos St Catherine\nanywhere, buy!)\nWhen nuts, fruits and other\namusements follow there is no ordained\naccompaniment. Possibly Port\u2014but I do\nnot understand it. I would carry on with\nthe sweet wine, the bubbly, or if\n(unlikely) embarking on cheese, one of\nthe red wines. Here, however, enters the\nPalo Cortado sherry. These are\nfascinating heavy brown(?) wines with the\nweight of an Oloroso but none of the\nassociated sweetness. I feel that they\ncould be drunk with any course of the\nmeal above, except for the hypothetical\nfish course. Not, mind you, in quantity,\nbut in moderation and with pleasure\u2014and\nwith a supply of good water to hand.\nFor pure pleasure, and with or without\ninteraction with food, the best fruit juice I have encountered is the Tolley late-harvested Muscat\u2014try it.\nJohn Finley.\nCity and Guilds\nDINNER\nAND\nDANCE\nat the\nPark Lane Hotel\nDancing 'til two\nContact Guilds Office for tickets\n\n"

The first explosion\nseems to have incapacitated virtually all\nof the electrical system, including lights\nand the public address system. The radio\nroom was also destroyed after the first\nexplosion, so communications (including\nthose to and from Claymore and Tartan,\nwhich were routed through Piper) were\nlost almost immediately.\n\u2022 There was questionable safety\norganisation. Because diving operations\nwere in progress at the time of the initial\nevent on Piper, both of the independent\nfire pumps were switched from automatic\nto manual operation, to prevent damage\nto divers operating in the vicinity of the\nsub-sea pump inlets following accidental\nstarting of the pumps. Thus, when the\nworst happened, there was no fire water.\nremotely\u2014a sufficient part. Safety also\nrequires an appropriate management\nstructure. But management cannot be\nmerely prescriptive. Offshore safety in the\nUk has traditionally been governed by\nregulations, generally emanating from the\nDepartment of Energy. The regulations\nhave their uses: if the management of an\ninstallation fails to obey the regulations,\nthey can be required to do so or face\nshutdown. But a regulations-bound system\nfalls down because practices not covered\nby the regulations are simply not\naddressed. People become complacent\nwhen they are encouraged to think that\nsafety can be ensured by regulations\nenforced by inspectors. This is precisely\nthe reason why the Health & Safety at\nWork Act was introduced in 1974: to\nreplace a myriad of regulations with\nplacement of the primary responsibility\n\u2022 There was a questionable evacuation\nprocedure. The only person who could\norder abandon j ment of the platform was\nthe Offshore Installation Manager, whose\nposition was anal ago us to that of the\nCaptain of the ship. He appears never to\nhave ordered evacuation. Thus many of\nthose who died were mustered (correctly)\nin the main accommodation module\u2014and\nwaited there while conditions\ndeteriorated. Many who survived did so\nby ignoring the rules and taking their\nown chances.\nWhat are the lessons of Piper? What is\nthe way ahead? It is clear from the\nfailures just described that there were\nsome technical failures but more\nimportantly there were management\nfailures. The technically perfect system\ncan always be circumvented. Thus while\ntechnical measures are a necessary part\nof safety, they are in no sense\u2014not even\nfor safety with those who create the risks\nand those who work with them, in other\nwords with the platform management and\noperators in the present context.\nThus the real way ahead lies with\nchanging the hearts and minds of those\nwho work offshore and those who\nmanage them. A cultural change, where\nsafety is an explicit part of everyday\nworking life, is essential. The first and\nmost significant step in this direction is\nthe use of onshore methods offshore. The\nreplacement of the Department of Energy\nby the Health & Safety Executive as the\nregulatory body and the replacement of\nthe externally imposed regulations by\nself-regulation, as exemplified in formal\nsafety assessments, are some of the most\nimportant recommendations made by\nLord Cullen. We need to be sure that the\nindustry takes them up wholeheartedly.\nOtherwise, we are just waiting for the\nnext Piper.\nThree\nMile\nIsland\nOn Thursday 29th November Professor\nGraham Wallis from Dartmouth College,\nHanover USA, gave the annual Newitt\nlecture in the Chemical Engineering\ndepartment.\nThree Mile Island was the first major\naccident involving a commercial nuclear\nreactor. During the course of the incident,\nwhich lasted for over two hours, radiation\nwas released into the containment\nbuilding with very little being released\ninto the environment. It has been\nestimated that around thirty people have\ndied as a result of the accident, all\ncancers caused by the release of noble\ngases long after the initial incident.\nFollowing the accident the company\nresponsible for the building of the reactor\nwere sued for $4.5 billion, more than the\nthey were worth.\nThe press uri sed water reactor (PWR)\nused 100 tons of Uranium Oxide to\nproduce around 300 MW of heat. The fuel\nrods were made from pellets of the fuel\ncontained within metal tubes. Hundreds\nof these rods stacked together formed the\nreactor core which is then contained\nwithin a pressure vessel approximately\nfour by six metres with walls around\ntwenty centimeters thick. The vessel was\nable to withstand a pressure of up to 170\nbar.\nThe problems started when the main\nfeed water to the boilers was shut down due to problems with the supply. This\nwas were caused by ion-exchange resin,\nused to remove impurities in the water,\nbecoming entrained in the water and\nblocking valves and pipes.\nWithin five seconds the residual water\nin the boilers began falling. In less than\nfifty seconds the boilers were almost dry.\nThus the heat generated by the reactor\nwas not being dissipated. The reactor was\nthen shut down, control rods were\ninserted stop ing the chain reaction.\nAlthough this reduced the heat being\nproduced, fission products continued to\nproduce heat at a rate of 150 MW. This\nlevel fell during the course of the\naccident to around 30 MW within a few\nhours.\nTo absorb the heat generated auxiliary\ncooling water should have come on\nautomatically. Unfortunately the valves\nthat connected the pipes to the boilers\nhad been left shut during maintenance\nwork. Only after three and a half minutes\nwas this water available, and so the\nreactor began to gradually cool.\nDespite this, the water inside the\nreactor itself continued to heat up and\neventually began to boil. The steam\nproduced escaped through a safety value\nand began to flood the floor of the\ncontainment vessel. The level of water\n26\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nArmed with blue rinse and pension book, dare you enter.\nThe Bingo Zone Outside in the queue, the buzz of\nanticipation grew almost instantaneously\ninto a hum of excitement. Almost in\nreply, the all-glass doors swung open and\nthe jostling crowd lurched forward to the\nhallway's beckoning leer. Devoid of any\nof the etiquette and manners instilled\nwithin them by years of meticulous\npatience, the clamors and shoving\nescalated. This was going to be a battle\nof the fittest. Canes swiped at the air\nabove the clattering walking frames\nwhich skewered any offending feet, whilst\nthe wheelchairs simply crushed anything\nin their tracks in the frenzy to the seats.\nThe Top Rank bingo hall was now open.\nInside, the warm air calmed the\npacemakers, and the freshly drawn\npensions emerged, the wallets releasing\nthe stale odour of mothballs and decaying\npeople into the recently sterilised\nafternoon air. Having only just survived\nthe desperate rampage to enter, I stood\nwho stumbled in from the cold.\nBeing such a poor fool, and now feeling\nall the confidence that being an IC Stude\ncould instill, I confidently strolled up to\nthe desk to buy my game-cards. Fast\nFlyer? Lucky Numbers? American National or Regional Countdown?... ' Oh yes, I 'll buy them all.' And so I staggered\naway, clutching my tickets to fame\nfortune and other nice money things,\ndesperately hoping that I had brought a pen with me. As I glanced at the massive\npile of multi coloured card in my arms, I began to realise that this was not going\nto be quite as simple as nipping into a bingo booth for lOp at Hayling Island.\nSlightly more cautious now, I decided to\neye out the opposition and the tiers filled,\nfading the aurora from a gaudy orange of\nupholstery to a prevailing grey of ancient\nhair. All eyes glared at me, the imposter,\nwandering sheepishly to a spare seat.\nDown on the tables below, the real\nicy silence descended upon the Hall as\nthe first game was called.\nFumbling to the lemon card (or was I holding the yellow or beige one?), I realised that the monotone pierce had\nalready announced the first three calls. In\nblind panic I checked the domineering\nred screen which had suddenly become a blaze of lights. I was only just capable of\ntracing these missing digits as a shriek\ngargled from below. Frantic ushers leapt\nover the seats from all sides, apparently\nto aid the dying beast. Reaching for my Vodaphone, I had just dialed 999 to\nreport a major coronary in Sheffield\nBingo Hall as the jubilant winner's card\nnumber was announced and checked, and\nthe \u00a3 5 prize presented.\nThe next game was immediately started\non the pink page of the countdown card.\nA wicked stepmother directed me to the\npage and I vowed to prove my worth\nagainst these deranged souls and keep\nbitch, she always wins,' and the like were\nrife after each scream. At one point I was\nconvinced that the lady behind was going\nto throw herself bodily at the lady in\nfront in a rage of jealousy, with no heed\nfor my unwitting obstruction. The\nusherettes and caller only just managed\nto sedate her before she did me any\nserious injury.\nNow determined not to associate myself\nwith these maniacs, I began to ponder\nthe easy winnings. With what appeared to\nbe the entire elderly population of the\narea here, left a lot of unoccupied houses.\nOn realising that they spent all their\nmoney here and so would not have\nanything worth taking, I opted merely to\nawait them at the end of the roads to\nmug them on return. Even better would\nbe to spend the 50p entry and risk\nslaughter in the Hall to memo rise the\nfaces of the Big Winners and get'em on\nthe way out...\nback to allow the native savages to settle\nbefore confronting the great dilemma of\nwhich games to enter myself. The sensual\nslip of a forty-year-old at the desk had\ncharmed me into becoming a free life\nmember, and so I was to enjoy the\nprivilege of a First Free Visit.\nI had always assumed bingo to be an\nold ladies' excuse for an afternoon\nwaddle into town to do a spot of\nshopping and then meet her friends over\na relaxing chat, crossing off a few\nnumbers every minute or so to stop their\nbrains from switching off. I was beginning\nto realise that this was by no means the\ncase. These dear old ladies had hatred\nand greed scoured into their faces.\nDespite the very reasonable bar, only a few would dare part with their bingo\nmoney on such a frivolous manner. It\nwas only the foolish amateur middle-a gers who were only in it for a piss-up. The\njolly photos displayed outside of sweet\ndears enjoying their ice-creams hid a more sinister portent to any poor fool\nhardened pros were setting up. In silence,\nthey painstakingly arranged their books\ninto game order, pausing only to\nmemo rise the numbers and opposition.\nHere it must be explained that game\nbooks are sold in sets of at least four\ncards which means that any person in a game is playing a minimum of four cards\nat one time. I was to find this alone nigh\nimpossible, yet down on these tables sat\nmean and lean ladies who looked barely\ncapable of holding a pen, poised, like\npraying mantises, to strike off twenty\ncards or more at a time.. These are the\nones that live bingo. Their days are spent\non the phone arranging more visits or\ngloating over winnings, whilst their\nafternoons and evenings are spent in the\nHalls, winning enough to pay for the\nphone bill.\nTime was drawing on so I retired back\nto my seat only to discover the problem\nof keeping track of thirty-odd cards\nwithout spilling them over my neighbours. The adrenaline rose and an\ntrack of the numbers. In fact, it took all\nmy concentration to keep up with the\nrabid caller, let alone be able to\nconcentrate on what number I needed to\ncomplete one line, two lines or a full\nhouse as the game required. I cursed as\nagain and again the animals screeched\nthe instant a winning number was shown,\nbefore it had even been announced.\n'They must know the manager,' I concluded.\nTime and games progressed, and as I gained proficiency and broadened my concentrations beyond the tiny squares\nbefore me, I noticed some evil rivalry\nbetween these lovely old people.\nThestakes gradually rose to \u00a3 1 2 0 , \u00a3200,\n\u00a3500 and even \u00a3 6 7 3 . What these affluent\nmisers did not realise was that had MY number come up, or had they kept quiet\njust one more number, that I would be\nable to pay off my overdraft and buy that\nstereo I'd had my eye on. Unfortunately,\nmany of the other dears had similar\nschemes of their own. Murmurs of 'That\nI was wrenched from my scheming by\nanother gurgling cry. On glancing down, I realised that I too had won! The biddies\naround me commented dryly about first\ntime winners as I whooped, jumped and\nrejoiced over the \u00a3 1 0 1 was to share with\nthe rather frail gentleman in the third\nrow. Staring down at my newly won fiver, I entered the last games with\nrenewed gusto, hoping for more and\ndrooling at the slap-up meal 1 could now\nbuy at McBuggers after the gruelling\nthree-quarter hour session.\nThe players left as quickly as they had\narrived, probably all racing to the nearest\ntelephone to tell Maud about their latest\nwins. Behind them the trail of wreckage\nhad to be cleared by the next session.\nPlastic bags and dead cards interspersed\nbroken cut-throat glass.

The pages bearing the 'Jive\nBunny' song are apt to deposit more than\nthey remove. This book is only worth\nconsideration for students of\nbrainwashing; its attempt to convince\nthose too young to defend themselves\nthat 'Jive Bunny is the best music man in\ntown' is truly sickening.

    "content": "\\Veas $ir\nEarl Ear\nDear FELIX,\nWhy For Art Thou\nI would be grateful if you could pass\nmy comments on the above article\nappeased on the last FELIX, to Athena,\nthe author.\nThere was a surprising om mission of\nBuddhism in the article above which\ndiscusses the pros and cons of religion.\nProbably, the author may not be having\nsufficient knowledge of the philosophy of\nBuddhism. To be frank, I know only very\nlittle of Buddhist philosophy which takes\nseveral years of full time study for a layman to understand. But, I would be\nable to address some of the points\ndiscussed in the article from the Buddhist\npoint of view.\n1. As far as women's rights are\nconcerned, ordination of women was\naccepted in Buddhism around 600 BC by\nLord Buddha, the founder of Buddhism,\nhimself. Since then, ordination of women was part of the Buddhist society. The first\nwoman Prime Minister in the world is\nfrom Sri Lanka, a society dominated by\nthe Buddhist culture.\n2. On how liberal Buddhist philosophy\nis: I would like to quote directly his\nwords.\n'Do not accept anything by mere\ntradition.\nDo not accept anything because it\nappears in Scriptures.\nDo not accept anything because it is\ntaught by the respected.'\n'As the wise test gold by burning, cutting\nand rubbing it, so are you to accept my words after examining and not merely\nout of regard to me.'\n(Gautama the Buddha)\n3. Out right rejection of cast system:\n' A person becomes a Brahmin( higher\ncast) or a Havijam (low cast) not by his\norigin but by his deeds.'\n(The Gautama the Buddha)\n'He was from a higher cast family, in fact\na prince.'\n4. On compassion:\n'Go fourth for the good of the many\nFor the happiness of the many\nOut of compassion for the world.'\n'Hatred never ceases by hatred but by\nlove.'\n(Gautama the Buddha)\n5. On intolerance of violence:\nIn Buddhism, harming any living being\nfor any reason, is not tolerated unlike\nsome other religions where animals lives\nare sacrificed for God.\n6. Buddhists are supposed to believe in\nthemselves, not on an all powerful God.\nA person, himself is responsible for what\nhe/she does, but nobody else.\nHope these points would be useful to you\nin the future.\nWith kind regards,\nPriyantha.\nDear Chris,\nSubject: Rejoinder to 'Michael Newman\non the right to be blasphemous'\nWhat struck me about the article under\nreference is the admission of some\nassertions by individuals the author has\nevident regard for as incontrovertible\nevidence of truth. Unfortunately, the law\nof evidence is made of sterner stuff. Dr\nJacob Bronowski is free to hold personal\nopinions but his being a scientist and\nhumanist does not confer 'papal\ninfallibility' on his utterances not even the\ntitle of Dr or Prof can do that except if\nthe author will want the reading public to\naccept Dr Bronowski's utterance as a 'revelation'!\nTo further underscore the significance\nof this point. Think of it, how many self-respecting academics will today regard\nthemselves as Freudian Psychologists? But\nFreudian Psychology was once the thing.\nCan you i amg in e the damage done to\nsociety as a result of this naive attitude of\naccept ive and bandying about the\nutterances of individuals who prat\nthemselves about as scientists, as\nscientific truth? My advice for the author\nis to carry out a thorough study into the\ndifferences between value judgements \"\nand scientific facts on the one hand, and\nfacts and truth on the other.\nFinally, may he by these sayings be\nadmonished: Beyond reason there is\nintuition and beyond intuition there is\nFAITH. CM Harry, Management School.\nDear FELIX,\nI was stirred to reply to Michael\nNewman's 'Blasphemy' article of\nNovember 30. His initial thoughts on\nblasphemy were sensible but he seemed\nto go on to say all religion was inhuman,\ncruel and th oro ugly evil. I would like to\ncontest his argument, using the example\nof my own faith, Christianity, which is the\nonly one I am qualified to defend.\nTo start with Mr Newman omits all the\ntremendous things that Christianity has\ncontributed to the world. I won't bother\nto start to name them here.\nSecondly, he fails to make a distinction\nbetween what Christianity teaches and\nwhat people do in its name. One might\nconsider the violence of the French\nrevolution in the name of freedom and\nequal rights, the Nazi scientists\nexperimenting in the name of science. Do i we rid the world of freedom or science,\ntherefore.' I could point out the\nmonstrous evils of regimes having an\nLETTERS\nEarful\nDear Chris,\nAs the annual 'Christmas' sales drive\nbecomes more and more like a religious\nfestival, I'd like to offer the following\nprayer:\nLord,\nWe thank you for our free trade, and\nfor the prosperity and Christmas presents\nthis brings. At this time we pray for those\nless fortunate than ourselves\u2014those that\nsuffer in countries without financial\ntolerance.\nWe pray for those that work hard to\nprovide for their families, but still have\nmost of their earnings stolen by the\n'state'. We pray for those that have to\nsuffer the effects of poverty traps due to\nsocial security measures.\nAt this time we pray particularly for\nthose willing and able to earn money, but\nare prevented from working by the greed\nof those with jobs, by their artificially\nhigh wages due to collective bargaining\nand minimum wage laws.\nSo we ask, Lord, that you will free the\npaths to great prosperity, not just for\nthose with a comfortable if restricted\nquality of life, but particularly those in\nthe most need of the freedom to work to\nbetter their lives.\nIn the name of the Father, the Son and\nthe Spirit of Enterprise, A men. Thomas Wyatt.\nabsence of religion\u2014Stalin, Pol Pot, most\nEastern Bloc countries, China...should we\nrid the world of atheism?\nThirdly, Mr Newman describes religion\nas un empirical and unreasonable.\nChristianity can be corroborated by the\nwealth of evidence of the res sure c tion and by the tangible and physical acts of\nGod in the lives of those who love him.\nWhat else does he want?\nLastly, it appeared that a focus for\nMichael Newman's anti-religious ideas is\nthe heart felt grief of a man whose family\nwere murdered at Auchswitz. It seems to\nme that Auchswitz was the result of\nman's decision to drop the God of love\nand this teaching to love, and man's decision to do whatever he wants,\nwhenever he feels like it.\nI would be most interested to continue\nthis discussion with Michael Newman should he wish to do so.\nYours,\nJez Spearman, Civ Eng MSc.\n41\nEardrum\n\n"

    "content": "Career's Office Cuts\nThree Careers Advisors may be lost from\nthe Careers Office if College do not agree\nto pay an extra SI00k pa to the\nUniversity of London (UL). The three\nCareers Advisors (CA's), are employed by\nthe University of London Careers\nAdvisory Service (ULCAS) who have\nposted them at Imperial. This currently\ncosts Imperial S55k pa. Due to changes in\nUL funding, however, the College has\nbeen asked to pay SI05k this year and\nS148k in future years.\nThere were indications last August that\nCollege may decide to run the Careers\nService itself although there is no plan so\nfar. In an emergency meeting of the\nCareers Advisors Comittee last Monday,\nwhich included Union representatives but\nat which none of the CA's were present,\nit was noted that the proposal to pull out\nhas not yet been costed. Fears as to the\nfuture quality of service were also\nexpressed.\nOne major diss advantage of pulling out\nof UL CAS is that Imperial will not be able\nto take part in the UL milk round.\nImperial has it's own milk round,\nattracting 120 companies, but students\ncan meet a different and varied set of\ncompanies at the UL event, over 130 this\nyear. Brian Steptoe, the Director of\nUL CA AS, has told Angus Fraser,\nManaging Director, that if College does\nnot pay the \u00a3 1 0 5 k this year then UL CAS services will be withdrawn on 3rd Febuary, in the middle of the milk round.\nIt was for this reason that Benjamin\nTurner, Deputy President, said that is was\n'vital to negotiate quickly'\nBenjamin was also wo ried about the\nfuture impartiality of the Careers Service.\nAt the moment the service covers a wide\nrange of interests, but this might be cut\ndown to science based subjects if run by\nCollege. Benjamin commented that\n'impartiality is important'.\nThe change in the fee for UL CAS has\nbeen brought about because Imperial has\nbeen asked to pay its share of the\noverheads at Gordon Square (the\nheadquarters of ULCAS). In the past the\noverheads have been payed for by the\nUniversity of London, taking the money\nfrom the grant it recieve s from the\nUniversity Funding Council (UFC). UL would then split the remainder of the\ngrant between the colleges.\nFor over ten years, however, Imperial\nhas received its own grant directly from\nthe UFC, meaning that it did not pay any\nmoney towards the overheads, the cost\nbeing bo urn by the other London\ncolleges. Now, changes to the funding\nmechanism will mean that UL will split its\ngrant between the colleges before paying\nfor overheads. Each college will then be\nbilled seperate ly for overheads, thus\nincreasing the cost to Imperial by SlOOk.\nIronically, a study on central\nadministration requested by Lord Flowers\nthe fe as ability of federal funding around\nUL based upon the number of students\nsupported by a service was com misi one d by Lord Flowers, a previous Rector at\nImperial, and carried out by John Smith,\nthe College Secretary of Imperial at the\ntime. The position of College Secretary\ndoes not now exist, the job has been\nreplaced by Director of Imperial College,\nheld by Angus Fraser.\nCommunications between College and\nBrian Steptoe suggest a minor step down as Angus Fraser has said that there will\nbe further discussion on the matter. The\nprecipitous action originally considered\nhas been deferred while final figures are\nagreed.\nUnion Win Balls Ironised\nThe Union Speculation team have won the Finance, Business and Investment\n(FBI) Society's portfolio share competition.\nThe team, comprising of the Union\nPresident Paul Shanley, Deputy President\nBen 'Boesky' Turner, Union Finance\nofficer Reggie Blennerhasset and his\nassistant Louise van der Straeten, issued a collective statement - 'Ha! We beat the lot\nof you wan kers!' Gremlins hit the Felix office this week\nwhen everything, including the Print Unit\nManager, broke down. The printing of\nthis week's Felix was delayed due to a mechanical failure of the lithograph and\nthe typesetting machine. These were\ncompounded by intermittent faults with\nthe bromide developer and personal\ncomputer.\nThe breakage of the offset litho on\nThursday prevented any printing being\nperformed for two days. All other print\nwork had to be postponed, and the\nproduction of Felix was put back two\ndays. The fault was caused by the over-enthusiasm of Felix Business Manager\nwhilst attempting to remedy a minor\nhitch. The lever arm controlling the\npaper feed sheared and a replacement\nThe Mines ball has been sold out and the\nCity and Guilds ball have sold 120 of the\n200 tickets already. The Mines ball is this\nevening (Friday), and the C&G ball is\nnext term.\nHenry Langdon, president of the Mines\nUnion, and Kurt Budge have raised S105\nthrough having their heads partially\nshaved.\npart could not be delivered until the next\nday. Printing continued soon after, but\nthe free gift planned by Chris Stapleton,\nPrint Unit Production Manager, had to be\nscrapped.\nThe curse continued on Sunday when\nthe typesetter processor also failed. A switch burnt out preventing the unit from\nbeing turned off, resulting in overheating.\nNot to be deterred, Felix staff developed\na method of processing the typeset by\nhand, producing mixed results. The\nequipment was eventually repaired on\nWednesday, the intended day of\npublication.\nCommenting on the incidents, Chris\nStapleton said that 'its a pain in the butt...\nbut at least it gave us a news story in\ncase things run short!'\nThe inviolate mascot of the Royal College\nof Science Union, Jez the Fire engine, has\nbeen in a poor state of health since the\nsummer and is about to be repaired. A conspiracy of faulty gauges and a lack of\noil caused parts of the engine to fail. The\nradiator also needed rebuilding and this\nhas now been collected from Brighton. It\ncost S1200 and was paid for on a five\nyear plan which was approved last\nFebruary.\nShe is expected to be back on the\nstreets by the second week of next term.\nGremlins Aack!\n3\n\n"

The vocal sections\nrange from plain song-based passages to a more operatic style: a necessary variety\nin a piece of this length. Both the adult\nand children's choirs produced strong,\nclear singing, while the pure, assured\ntones of the Polish soprano, Malgorzata\nArma now ska floated clearly above the\naccompaniment.\nWalton described his oratorio,\nBelshazzar's Feast as 'a beastly noise' and\nthe setting of verses from the Old Testament concerning the downfall of\nBabylon is certainly not fainthearted. Nor\nwas this rendering, from the opening\nfanfare, through the full-blooded praise of\nthe pagan gods (whimsically coloured by\ndifferent instruments such as percussive\nwood) to the final joyful alleluias. Sadly,\nwhile Stephen Roberts sang the solos\naccurately, they lacked passion or\nexpression, robbing the piece of some of\nits drama, particularly in his\nannouncement of Belshazzar's death.

    "content": "Even for one term there is such a vast\ncollection of news that I had decided to\ncategorise all the stories. The numbers of\nstories in each category gives an\ninstructive overview of what has been\npreoccupying FELIX this autumn.\nLaw and Order16 Rag Affairs 9\nContinuing Stories 9\nGeneral Stupidity 8\nResignations etc. 6\nThe Union 6\nImportant Visitors 5\nInteresting Irrelevancies 3\nFire and Flood 3\nCollege Tyranny 2\nLaw and Order Even if you disagree with my categorisation there is no doubt that theft\nhas been the biggest problem in IC this\nterm. This leads me to believe that IC\nsecurity officers, Messrs Briley and\nReeves, are the only people in the\nCollege with a real job to do. Considering\nthe vast amount of information they have\ngiven to FELIX over the last few years I feel they should be awarded an honorary\nnews reporter ship. It is tragic that after the landlord and\nthe Government take their pound of flesh,\nthe thief deftly removes the rest. To date\nsince the beginning of term we have seen\nscores of bicycle thefts. We have had\nmore walk-in thieves reported than there\nare things for such a thief to steal. A cheque book and card were stolen from a locker in Mech Eng. Personal stereos,\nrecorder and a microwave, probably to\nsomeone living in the hall, which only\ngoes to show you that the non-student\nworld doesn't have a monopoly on such\nvermin. In comparison to people who removed 20 metres of copper piping from\nunder Sherfield which would have saved\npeoples' lives in case of a fire, the above\nvermin are positively benevolent. I agree\nwith the sentiment that IC would run just\nas well (and probably better) if Sherfield\nceased to be, but I don't think murdering\nthe occupants is really called for.\nI words of the news story 'the RCSU\nmascot ry team had been unavailable for\ncomment...'. The most useful phrase in\nthe reporter's thesaurus speaks volumes\nthrough insinuation. Last week there was\na case of indecent exposure in a departmental library. He was probably\ntrying to upstage the nude kamikaze\nparachute jump.\nSo what has been done to counter this\ncatalogue of petty and not so petty\ncrime? Two vermin (or bicycle thieves if\nyou prefer) were spotted and caught by a Rag Week: a poor turnout\n'Unsocial behaviour' on the part of\nsome people resulting in lavatory rooms\nin Mech Eng being given new textured\nwall decoration in glorious shit-brown. It\nis a personal theory that the culprits were\nfed up with magnolia. ICU people were\nsuspected of having vandalised the toilets\nClayponds: Imperial's newest residence\ncheque books and \u00a3220 were stolen from\nthe Union Gym. A number of cars have\nbeen broken into near the Old Chemistry\nBuilding and a football kit was stolen\nfrom Southside. Fisher Hall lost a video\nat St Mary's to the tune of \u00a3150\u2014in\nrevenge for a mascot ry affair. The plaque\nfrom the Management School was stolen,\nand after this had been reported in FELIX it suddenly reappeared. In the damning\ncertain Mr Pitrola. Identity checks were\nstarted in Southside Bar. 'There are a lot\nof people who should not be in the bar\nand we must comply with the licensing\nlaw' said Bar Manager, Roger Pownall.\nThis may have been the result of a serious fracas in Southside three weeks\nbefore which resulted in a man trying to\nescape from the police by running down the tube tunnel at South Kensington\nstation. Mr Pownall's considered and\nreasoned response can be compared to\nRob Northey's 'the next bastard who has\na punch-up at Southside I'm going to turn\nthe fire hose on'. The question remains\nwhether the identity checks will prevent\nsuch drunken fights or help induce them.\nThe security officers have been plugging\nbicycle D locks and their emergency\nnumber (3372) like mad. Mr Briley\nsummed up what us potential victims\ncould do by saying we could 'show a little\nresponsibility in shutting doors and using\nlocks'. The bicycle coding sessions proved\na great success with 130 people bringing\nitems to code.\nRag Affairs\nThis got a lot of coverage in the last few\nweeks. They have raised thousands of\npounds so far. Monopoly raised \u00a34,600,\nTiddlywinking down Oxford Street\n\u00a31,500. The Rag raid to Guildford raised\n\u00a3185, the Leukaemia Research pub crawl\nraised \u00a3430, the RCS Beer Festival raised\n\u00a34,700 (and I was moaning about\nimpoverished students!). The Hypnosis\nLecture proved a great success making\nover \u00a31,000 and the C&G Slave Auction\n\n"

    "content": "The Hot Spot\nA drifter arrives in a small town, so\nsmall infact, he's informed, there's only two things to do and just one\nif you don't have a TV...Left with only\nthis one thing to do, he gets involved\nwith two women and then his troubles\nreally begin.\nThe Hot Spot, directed by Dennis\nHopper, follows the unscrupulous trail of\nHarry Madox (Don Johnson) a charismatic\nkinda guy who, finding himself in the\nblistering, godforsaken Texas town,\nquickly gets a job as a car salesman. The two women he comes across, one good,\none bad, are both beautiful and complex.\nIn the good corner is Gloria Harper,\n(Jennifer Connelly), a naive, young\naccountant whose life is mysteriously\ncomplicated by blackmail. In the bad\ncorner is Dolly Harshaw (Virginia\nMadsen), his new boss's conniving,\nimpossibly alluring wife.\nThe film has blackmail, heat, arson,\nheat, passion, heat, murder and a great\nbluesy soundtrack. By the way, did I mention it's a tad on the warm side?)\nBased on Charles Williams' (Dead Calm)\nnovel, Hell Hath No Fury, it's a film in which all the characters find their own levels in the end.\nJohnson's cool, Madsen's hot, Connelly's cute and Hopper has a good eye, two in fact. Advertised as 'noir' for the 90s, they're not lying. The Hot Spot has a simple intensity that draws you in. If you liked Body Heat starring William Hurt\nand Kathleen Turner you'll enjoy The Hot\nSpot.\nRich.\n\u2014Concert\n\u2014Theatre\n\u2014Comic/Graphics\n\u2014Film\nCity of Birmingham\nSymphony Orchestra\nThis was a concert of contrasting\nhalves in more than one sense. The programme was divided between\ntwo late eighteenth century pieces before\nthe interval and an early twentieth\ncentury symphony afterwards. It also\ndivided equally between the excruciating\nand the exhilarating.\nThe orchestra began Haydn's Symphony no 70 in D with a rich warm sound and performed the first two\nmovements competently, but both their\ntone and composure deserted them in the\nthird movement and were only slightly\nregained by the end of the piece.\nImogen Cooper bravely executed\nMozart's Piano concerto no 22 in E flat,\nfaced as she was with support from an\norchestra and conductor rapidly losing\ncontrol. By the end of the first\nmovement, the lack of balance and some\nsloppy playing from the strings (especially\nin the opening twenty seconds) had\nAir America REVIEWS\nconvinced me that writing anything in E flat was a mistake. The final movement\nwas performed more creditably and the\nwoodwind were noticeable for not lapsing\ninto the general disintegration. Against\nthis Cooper managed sufficient sensitivity\nin the piece to make it merely\nunpleasant.\nAfter the interval, the orchestra swelled\nto full size and the change to the drama\nof Walton's Symphony no 1 in B flat\nminor altered the mood completely. The playing was crisp and full of gusto, doing\njustice to this magnificent score. Walton's work rivals anything being produced on the continent at the time and this half of\nthe programme more than compensated\nfor the disappointments of the first half.\nHaving been prepared to write off the\nCBSO at the interval, I must say that they\ncan play - but only if they choose their\nprogramme carefully.\nLiz W. Many Mel Gibson fans will find this\nfilm a severe disappointment. Not\nonce is his Gluteus Maximus\nexposed to the adoring masses, and he\nnever once fires a gun (despite a rather\nthreatening wave of an Uzi(9 mm?)). So\nwhat does he do in the film then? Well,\nfly quite a bit, crash occasionally and\ngenerally act slightly b army in a Buddhist\nsort of way. He is a pilot for the CIA's covert airline\nacting in Laos, next to Vietnam, during\nthe Vietnam war. Officially they are not\nthere, despite the fact they are flying out\nof an Airbase that is effectively the\nsecond largest city in the country. They\nfly aircraft illegal in the states, dropping\nanything from pigs to fire arms over local\nvillages. Unfortunately they are also\nhelping transport drugs for a local\nwarlord who is helping them sub sid is e this war. When a senator arrives on a fact finding tour it is obvious that a scapegoat is going to be needed to take\nthe heat off the real organisers of this\nillicit trade. Gene (Mel Gibson) and newly\narrived Billy (Robert Downey Jr.) seem\nthe obvious candidates.\nThis film is one of the very few that I have seen that manages to combine both\nentertainment and message. The film is\nfunny when it needs to be, serious when it needs to be and exciting when it needs\nto be. The antics of Mel and the rest of\nthe pilots, (the sort of people who justify\nthe clich e 'living on the edge'), encompass\nelements of both comedy and tragedy,\nwhile their superiors mix humor with\nthreat. All too often films which refuse to\npin their colour to any set genre end up\nmuddled and lost, but this has avoided\nthat trap.\nA Comedy/ Action/ Adventure that\ntaught me a lot about the hypocrisy of\nthe American Government, and loss of\nbelief, while entertaining me. This\ndeserves to be a blockbuster.\nPendragon.\n\n"
