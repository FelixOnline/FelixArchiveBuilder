    "content": "HUT ION ON FREEDOM OF CHOICE\nEMERGENCY MOTION.\nProposed by: C. Crownshaw.\nSeconded by: C.T. Williams.1. The Imperial College Union Constitution states that the Constituent College Unions are autonomous bodies, which can organise events\nindependently of the Imperial College Union.\n2. \u2022 In recent years much Union time which could be used to discuss important\nmatters relevant to improving the gu ali ty and scope of student life this college has been wasted by groups of extremists. These extremists are often politically motivated. Imperial College Union is a non party\npolitical body.\n3. The Constitution states that the aim of the Union is to promote social intercourse between students, and broaden the scope of their education\nat College. Social intercourse is promoted partially through the 5 . C.C. which includes political and pressure groups.\n4. I.C.U. U. G.M. December 4th1984. Rooms means facilities. ICU Believes:1. Any individual student is free to choose what he does within College, so\nlong as he does not break the law, and so long as his/ her actions do not\nimpose upon or harm fellow students.2. It is unethical for the group of people to be able to impose their way of\nlife, morals or beliefs upon another. One man's meat is another s poison. ICU Instructs: That it is the prerogative of the CCU's to hold whatever events they\nplease, according to the discretion of their Executive Committees, so\nlong as those Committees continue to receive support from their union\nmembers, and that CCU's may use IC Union rooms for any event.\nThat motions discussed at UGM's should have direct relevance to the Imperial\nCollege and Students Union.\nMOTION ON NICARAGUA.\nProposed by: Dave Hobbs\nSeconded by: C. Crownshaw.\nSince the Sandinist a overthrow of Samoza in1979 life in Nicaragua has improved\ngreatly. a) Illiteracy has been reduced from 50% to 12%.\nb) There has been 98% decline in new cases of Malaria. c) Infant mortality has been reduced from the highest in Latin America to an\nacceptable level. d) There will be a free election in1985 to form a new government.\ne) This motion will make absolutely no difference to American Foreign Policy and if this is the best progressive motion Martin At t well can come up with then he is in trouble. ICU Believes:1. The Sandinist a government has done more for the Nicaraguan people in four\nyears than the Somoza regime was ever likely to do.\n2. That the US government policies are considerably exacerbating the problems\nthroughout Central America.\nICU Instructs: The President of ICU to write to Ronald Reagan informing him of this motion and\nasking him to stop the US intimidation of Nicaragua. MOTION ON N.U.S. CONFERENCE.\nProposed by: Dave W. Parry (RCSU VP)\nSeconded by: Sean C. Davis (ICU Hon. Sec.) Eric Darbyshire (RCS Pre s).1. Union Council Committee (14th November 1983) decided to send three\nobservers to NUS Conference in Blackpool in December, at a cost of L2bb\nto \u00a3300.\n2. A Union Club came to UFC on Tuesday 10th November 1983 and asked for an\nextra \u00a3300 on their five year plan to buy extra, needed e gui p ment. After much discussion UFC decided that it could not afford to allocate this money at present due to the Equipment Fund being exhausted and the\nContingency Fund having very little reserve.3. Some of the money for NUS Conference ( if not all) will be spent from the\nContingency Fund.\n4. Colleges already within NUS have to elect their delegates to NUS Conference\non a College wide Ballot, so that all students can have an equal chance to go.\nICU Believes:5. That the general impression within IC is that ICU will not re affiliate to\nNUS in the near future. 'Union Officers in this College think it is more important to send observers\nto NU5 Conference than buy equipment needed by Union Clubs. If we do decide to send students to the NUS Conference, it should, like other Colleges, be decided on a College wide Ballot as all students at this College can have an equal chance of attend in q. We could find out as much information( if not more) of how NUS actually works by sending students to NU5 Headquarters in Holloway Road.\nThat this money is being spent very stupidly and could be put to better use.\nICU Instructs12! S Conference.\nUnion money should not be used to send observers\nThe whole process of sending people to, and spending money on conferences,\nshould be looked into by a committee composed of the following people,\nwhich shall report to Council next term: Publicity Officers from ICU, Rag,\nEnts, RCSU, RSMU, CAGU, Felix Business Officer( Chairman) and ICU AA0.\nProposed by: I. Bull. Seconded by: Everyone.\nICU Believes: That this years sabbaticals take everyone present at this UGM to the Queens\nand buys each person a drink. These are new motions to be voted upon for the\nfirst time today\nMotion to ICU on a motion to ULU -for\nLondon Union wide Human Rights U eek. s it y of Proposed by\nSeconded by\nO1 iver Smar t Francis Mi ers l: ICU Notes that1.1 Systematic human rights abuses are occur ing throughout the world by g over ment s of all political ideologies.1.2 In many countries, men, women and children who have neither used or ad voc a ted the use of violence are imprisoned, tortured and murdered, so1 ey for their political beliefs, religion, colour, language or ethnic origin.

    "content": "Letters. FELIX, Friday February 13th19872 Victims no\nmore\nDear Dave,\nI am sure that on reading the letter\n(FELIX 762) by the young woman\nwho had experienced an abortion,\nthat, many people will have been\nmoved by its expression of anger and\npersonal pain. The title \"Victims of\nAbortion,\" to which she referred, for\nthe talk by Olivia Gans, was chosen\nby Olivia herself and not PATA. She\nused this title because she had found\nthat most women, including herself,\nhad had little perception of many of\nthe personal consequences of having\nan abortion. For instance, she\nrevealed that recent research in the\nUS has produced strong evidence\nindicating that intense psychological\nsuffering and harm\u2014technically\ntermed Post Abortion Syndrome\u2014is\noften inflicted on women through\nabortion. The symptoms of PAS vary\nin degree from person to person but\nare often severe and frequently only\ncome to the surface with the onset of\nmenopause. The syndrome, she said,\nis aggravated by society's refusal to\nallow discussion of the experience of\nabortion; so that women cannot 'talk\nit through'. Olivia also paid tribute to\npost abortion counselling; this is\noffered only by the charity LIFE in\nthis country.\nPATA believes that if a woman is\ngiven the opportunity to receive non-directive counselling, sufficient\nmedical, financial, emotional and\nlegal help\u2014including advice on\nadoption\u2014then she will be able to\nchoose a positive alternative both for\nherself and her child. There should\nbe no need for a woman to throw\naway her life on a child, nor to kill\nthe child in order to avoid doing so.\nWe are promoting these positive\nalternatives because we perceive a real need for them to be made more\nwidely available.\nYours sincerely,\nPaul Rice, Secretary PATA.\nBuyers\nbeware\nDear Sir,\nI am writing to inform members of\nthe College of the action taken by the\nRembrandt Hotel against IC students\nat the end of last term. Garden Hall\nhad planned to hold its annual\nChristmas dinner at the Rembrandt\nCarvery, and had arranged the visit\nweeks in advance. The car very meal\nwhich the Rembrandt and other\nsimilar hotels offer, means that\ncustomers help themselves to a selection of food in the line of a traditional roast dinner. The standard'\ndeal means that patrons can eat as\nmuch as they want.\nIn previous years, parties from both\nWeekes and Garden Halls had found\nout well into the meal that seconds\nwere not to be made available to\nthem, and the staff and management\nof the Hotel openly shouted at the\ngroup when complaints were made.\nA couple of days before this year's meal, the Warden of Garden tried to\nobtain a written guarantee that these\nevents would not recur. At this point,\nthe management of the Rembrandt\nrefused, making the claim that all IC\ngroups had abused the car very in the\nlast year, adding that Imperial College\nstudents each too much! They said\nthat for this reason it had been decided\nthat parties from IC would not be\ngiven the standard car very deal, even\nthough they were paying full price.\nThe Warden was so astounded by the\nclaim that he made the staff member\nrepeat it several times. The hall dinner\nhad to be moved to the Regent Place\nHotel (Picadilly Circus) which was\nmore than satisfactory\u2014we know\nwhere to go next time!\nObviously IC groups are not\nwelcome at the Rembrandt, so parties\nwishing a full car very deal should\nlook elsewhere.\nYours,\nMark Salisbury.\nQuestion\ntime\nDear Dave,\nAfter reading Shaun Dunlop's letter\nin last week's FELIX I felt it was\nnecessary for me to reply as\nChairman of WellSoc.\nWellSoc has never been afraid of\nbeing controversial in choosing the\ntopics of the lectures it organises\nweekly. Indeed, we feel it is\nimportant at times to be so and our\nbest meetings this year have been the\nmost controversial. It is for people\nwho disagree with the topic to come\nto the meetings, to hear what the\nspeaker has to say and to question the\nspeaker at the end of the talk.\nUnfortunately, to the best of my\nknowledge, Mr Dunlop did not attend\nthe lecture given by Professor\nEysenck. Had he done so he would\nhave heard an extremely interesting\ntalk, totally lacking in the \"racial\nnonsense\" he wrote about in FELIX.\nAlthough WellSoc is apolitical, we\nobject strongly to the form of\nintellectual censorship which I believe\nMr Dunlop was attempting to\npractise. Members of the College\nhave every right to hear differing\npoints of view; if every speaker\ninvited by WellSoc was putting\nforward a view held by everybody\nthen WellSoc meetings would be\npointless.\nI totally support the decision of the\nExternal Secretary to invite Professor\nEysenck to lecture.\nLiz Tingley, Chem III.\nSpeaking of politics\nDear Editor,\nI would like to express my disgust\nat the political naivety which seems\nrife amongst students of all ages at\nImperial. The formulation of this\nview has nothing to do with the ICU\nExec or its clashes with College on\nimportant issues\u2014although I lose as\nmuch sleep as the next man over\nwhere my next burger is coming\nfrom. Instead, in my first few months\nat IC, I have come across many\nexamples of the complete failure of\nstudents to appreciate the big, wide\nworld of politics and its effect on all\nour future lives. For instance, there\nseems little or no awareness of the\nplight of UK manufacturing industry\namongst the 'rank and file' students\nof IC, most of whom will end up in\nindustry. Just at a time when many\nstudents (including myself) are\nforming a political identity there is\nlittle or no useful 'input data' with\nwhich to work. Since newspapers and\nTV are now awash with political\nmisinformation it would be helpful if\nCollege provided a balanced, well-informed environment in which\nstudents could discuss and decide for\nthemselves what politics were 'good\npolities'.\nFor this reason I would like to\ncondemn Leon Brittan's address to a Conservative Association meeting last\nweek. (Letter submitted last\nweek\u2014Ed). His speech rather cheaply\nsought to win a handful of first-time\nvoters and not only insulted the\nintelligence of the audience (was he\nreading a Sun editorial?) but also\nshowed a grave lack of\nresponsibility\u2014should a senior\npolitician (of whichever persuasion)\ntry to brain-wash or educate and\ninform a gathering of supposedly\nintelligent students? The gullibility of\nstudents to sit and swallow such\nelectioneering tripe without so much\nas a whimper and the Association's chairman to invite such a thoughtless\nspeaker is, in my view, not\nencouraging a mature attitude to\npolitics. I would not be surprised to\nfind the chairman of the Socialist\nSociety acting with a similarly\nblinkered view of what service he\nshould be providing. I suggest such\nbodies stop patting themselves on the\nback for getting 'big names' to\nCollege and start thinking about what\ntheir speakers talk about.\nYours sincerely,\nPaul Bullen, Elec Eng I In praise of Goosen\nDear Sir,\nI am writing with reference to Kemi\nAdenubi's letter (FELIX 762)\nconcerning the South African\nGovernment's incursions into\nneighbouring countries harbouring\nmembers of the terrorist wing.\nTerrorism identifies the perpetrators\nas legitimate targets and I whole\nhearted ly agree with Mr Goosen's view that they should be killed as\nefficiently as possible. Neighbouring\nstates must learn the price of\nsupporting terrorism and if this means\nviolating international law, then so be\nit.\nWe must be careful not to confuse\nthe morality of apartheid with the\nmorality of countering terrorism; a distinction which seemed to escape\nthe FELIX opinion article. As Mr\nGoosen pointed out, the ANC violence is largely directed at the\nblack populace, hence the security\nforces are not the only source of\nintimidation and oppression. The\nsituation has some parallels with\nsectarian violence in Northern\nIreland; if our forces withdrew this\nviolence would no doubt escalate.\nLikewise, if the South African\nGovernment collapsed the ANC\nmight choose to rule by force of the\ngun, with no real chance of reform\nthereafter, as probably would the IRA\nin Northern Ireland.\nFurthermore, Mr Adenubi's( Miss\u2014Ed) statement that \"suspected\nIRA terrorists must be extradited\"\nmight imply to him that South Africa\nis \"high handed\". In my opinion it\nmerely highlights the inadequacies in\nour own fight against terrorism. The\ntime has come for our Government to\ntake a stance comparable to that of\nSouth Africa and Israel, tracking these\nmurderers down and killing them\nwhether by trial and execution or in\nthe field. Currently we lack even the\ndeath penalty.\nI reserve my final comments for a number of the Anti-apartheid\ndemonstrators, specifically those who\nlabelled Mr Goosen and his\nsupporters racist. This was,\nundoubtedly, not because he was\nSouth African, but because he was\nwhite and South African. Had a member of the black South African\ncommunity been invited I'm sure\nthese same demonstrators would have\nbeen happy to listen. Consider then,\nwho are the racists?\nYours sincerely,\nMike Allen, Physics I. "

    "content": "EXEC NEWS President's Report1. Apologies For changing the date of this meeting. Due to several technical hitches the\npublicity wasn't out in time for last week and we felt it was better to postpone\nand let people know what was going on.\n2 . Junior Common Room Since the boycott, the Union's arguments appear to be taken seriously by\nCollege. There is now a new dimension in that College appear more willing\nto carry on with the original plan to swap the JCR and Main Dining Hall.\nAlso arising from the recent discussions comes a new long term plan\u2014to build\na NEW JCR in the same building as an indoor sports hall (which will have\nto be provided when the current volleyball court is demolished. I believe this\nis a good plan and attach a proposal to look into it further, which was accepted\nby the College Governor's Finance and Executive committees. If this long\nterm plan is accepted then our interim plans must be reviewed. (See paper\nappended).\nRecommendation: That this UGM supports the plan for a new JCR as\noutlined below and that this plan becomes long term Union Policy.\nIf this recommendation is passed, there are several interim options. Briefly,\nthese are:\n(i) to press for the original plan to go ahead ie have the JCR and Dining\nHall swapped.\n(ii) to go for complete control of QT and the JCR bar.\n(iii) to go for financial compensation for loss of conference related income,\neither as profit share or a linked sub vent ion increase.\n(iv) to go for control of the JCR bar plus financial compensation as above.\nOptions (i) and ii) are both fairly long term; the work to be done to swap\nthe rooms would not be complete for over a year; and the Union's management\nstructure would need improving before we could handle QT.\nI hope there will be much discussion of these options at the UGM however\nmy recommendation is as follows:\nRecommendation: That the Union presses for full control of the JCR bar\nand financial compensation for loss of conference related income until such\ntime as a new JCR, under Union control, becomes usable.\n3 . World University Service The motion on the Union's support of WUS is up for renewal at the UGM.\nI believe this is a very worthwhile charity and would like to propose that we\nextend our support beyond a simple annual collection. I would like to look\ninto setting up a campus scholarship to pay for a Third World student to study\nat IC.\n4 . Entertainments Committee Following many complaints about this year's Ents Committee I have looked\ninto their budget and discovered that Ents have not in fact lost any money\noverall this year. I have asked Dan Phillips to report on his activities to Council\non Monday 16th Feb.\n5 . Lesbian and Gay Welfare ICU Council voted to co-opi Robert Daniel to look into the problems facing\nlesbian and gay students and to provide information and advice. Council can\nco-opt people as necessary to look at any specific issue and report back. Robert\nnow has speaking rights at Council but not a vote as he was not elected.\n6 . Job Descriptions I now have a job description, of sorts, for all central Union posts including\nDep Reps. Anyone thinking of standing, see me and I 'll let you have a copy.\n7 . Welfare Questionnaire There have been several comments and complaints about the welfare\nquestionnaire. Whilst we accept that it isn't perfect, it still needs to be treated\nseriously. If the Union and College are to provide a realistic welfare service\nwe need this sort of information.\n8 . AIDS( i) Professor Anderson of the Biology department has asked to circulate\nanother more detailed survey to all students as part of his research into the\nspread of AIDS through the community. I would ask everybody to cooperate\nfully in this venture.\n(ii) It is widely felt that the government's campaign on AIDS is inadequate,\nrelying on doom laden imagery and short on facts. AIDS does affect everyone\nincluding us therefore it seems necessary to provide some factual advice about\nit.\nRecommendation: That the Union, in conjunction with Lesley Gillingham,\nprepare and distribute information and advice about AIDS.\n9 . Residences( i) Re-apps The decision to halve the number of re-applicant places in halls\nwas a desperate one, but unavoidable if rooms are to be found for all next\nyear's fresher s.( ii) New Places No news on the Evelyn Gardens houses yet. However, it\nappears that the College are finally setting up a mechanism for acquiring new\nproperty\u2014unfortunately the benefits won't be apparent until next year.\nDeputy President's Report Volleyball Court College Maintenance have finally got round to doing the 'urgent' repairs\nto the floor which have been needed since the start of last term. There seems\nto have been a general reluctance to spend money on this doomed area. As\nit will need to be used for probably the next five years I think this running\ndown period may have started just a mite too soon! As with the other Union\nroom or gym, if you notice any defect let me know.\nSelf defence Course A second course will start on March 2nd.I have sent letters to everyone\nstill on the Union office list with details. There will probably not be any spare\nplaces, but if any woman wished to add her name to the list, can she see Kath\nin the office.\nMoney We have just received two cheques: one from the bookshop, for \u00a37,500.\nThe three CCU's will each receive \u00a31,500, and ICU \u00a33,000.\nThe second was from the College's Conference Office for \u00a317,230.53, for\nJCR letting s, of which \u00a314,553.92 was for 1985/86.\nHon See's Report1. Vans Please can all drivers park the vans properly in the spaces provided just\ninside the barrier. Also please park them properly in their space. Do not park\nthem at funny angles, do not park them so they take up two spaces and if\nour spaces are full and you have to park elsewhere then park in the unnumbered\nbays.\nAll drivers must check oil and water levels before they drive the vans. If\nyou have to buy oil then buy some and take it off your overall bill. These\nvans are the Unions and when they don't run you complain often enough,\nso help make sure they stay on the road.\nSome vans have recently been for major repairs, and no doubt more will\nbe going in the future. With a little bit of care and decent driving these vans\ncould do a lot better than they are doing and we could save a bit of money\non unnecessary items such as dented tyres etc.\n2 . Outside Hire Vans Booking these is not very easy and un booking them is worse. If you wish\nto cancel then you do so before Wednesday of each week, or you get a late\ncancellation charge. Another thing is if you don't book before Wendesday\nthen if I have to book an outside hire van on Friday and I manage to (by some\nmiracle) then I'm thinking of not charging shared costing on a club that couldn't get its act together.\nAll clubs should confirm all bookings s>t least three/four days in advance\nto stop cock-ups, it's called being organised!\n\n"

Written, by\nRaymond Briggs, who wrote The\nSnowman, the film tells the story of\nJim and Hilda Bloggs, a supposedly\ntypical elderly couple who lived\nthrough the last world war and are\nnow faced with the prospect 6fa nuclear war.\nIt is an animated film and so some\nmight expect it to be less frightening\nthan say Threads or The Day After.\nWell this certainly isn't the case as the\nmany people who left the cinema in\ntears would testify. Indeed, Sir John\nMills and Dame Peggy Ashcroft, who\nare the voices of Jim and Hilda are\nsaid to have cried after watching it.\nThe film doesn't seek to put across\nany political views but in ste ud chooses to deal with real people (well,\nalmost real), and to show the utter\nhopelessness of the man in the street\nwhen faced with the ultimate terror\nof nuclear war.\nJim Bloggs, who is retired, is the\ndefinitive respectable citizen. He is\ncompletely un-question ning of the\ngovernment and so when an\n\"international crisis\" starts to get\nworse, Jim runs off to the public\nlibrary to get his copy of \"Protect and\nSurvive.\" Here, Briggs brings out the\nglaring inadequacies of this\npublication to great effect. You find\nyourself laughing loudly as Jim tries\nhopelessly to follow the instructions,\nbut then realise that it isn't funny.\nA beautiful example of this is when\nJim, much to the dismay of Hilda,\ntakes off all the doors to build the\n\"shelter\" and is then told a few pages\nlater to keep all the doors shut to\nminimise the effects of the blast!\nThe only criticism that could be\nlevelled at this moving film is that the\ntwo characters, Jim and Hilda, are\nslightly overdone, maybe just a little\ntoo naive, a bit too ignorant for belief.\nAre there really any people left who\nare oblivious of the horrors of nuclear\nwar and think that the next war will\nbe just like the last\u2014we'll be alright\nif we all pull together.\nJim and Hilda totally underestimate\nthe power and long-term effects of\n\"the bomb\" and are surprised when\nthe paper boy doesn't arrive the day\nafter telling them who won.\nI think that if the characters were\na little less ignorant and a little more\nbelievable then the film would be\nmore powerful (if that's possible).\nDespite this exaggerated ignorance,\nor maybe because of it, you can't help\ncaring about Jim and Hilda and you\nleave the cinema feeling that you\nreally know them and this makes what\nhappens to them all the more\nheart-rending.\nThe film has a chilling end that\nleaves the audience stunned into\nsilence. There's no stampede at the\nsight of the titles and it's an eerie\nsituation as everyone just sits in their\nseats staring blankly at the titles\nscrolling up with the hauntingly\nbrilliant song by Roger Waters, that\naccompanies them, blasting out. A very moving film\nAC Evans\nFILMS Boy Soldier\nMilwr Bychan (Boy Soldier) is a rare ty \u2014a film in which much of the\ndialogue is in the Welsh language\nwith English sub-titles.\nWil is a young soldier in Northern\nIreland who is charged with murder,\na 'crime' which he has been trained\nto commit. However, it soon becomes\nclear that Wil is being punished for\nfalling in love with a Catholic Irish\ngirl and because of his disillusionment\nwith the army\u2014his South Wales\nbackground is similar to the Irish and\nhe soon realises that he is fighting for\nthe wrong side.\nKarl Francis' film is low budget\nand unpolished which enhances the\ncutting edge to the brutal story of\nWil's treatment by the army.\nTo a non-Welsh speaker the film\nmay seem simply 'anti-army',\nhowever I felt that, through the\nuntranslated in u endo s of the Welsh\nlanguage, the story was an allegory\nof the English oppression of the\nWelsh. This point is arguable but the\nfact that Milwr Bychan sets out to\ndemonstrate the huge cultural divide\nbetween the English and Welsh is not.\nWil can put up barriers against his\nofficers by retreating into his native\ntongue, which is natural to him but\nincomprehensible to them.\nThe distribution of such a radical\nfilm would normally be considered\nbrave, the fact that it is in a language\nspoken by only a few thousand people\nmakes it unique.\nLiz Holford.\nFerris Bueller's Day Off\nA film about staying cool in Chicago\nwhilst constantly on the edge of big\ntrouble. Ferris Bueller's Day Off\nmerits more than a few hearty\nchuckles; its liveliness owes a lot to\nthe casting of Matthew Brokerick of\nWar Games fame as Ferris, who\ncoincident ly is a computer genius\namongst his other talents.\nBueller bunks off high school for\na day and get his girlfriend out to join\nhim by convincing the headmaster\nthat her grandmother has died. He\nthen persuades his best friend to take\nhis dad's prized old classic 250GT red\nFerrari out and there ensues a day of\nfast living freedom oiled by Bueller's ability for quick thinking and\nspending money to maximum\nenjoyment. The dismal attempts of his\nheadmaster to catch him are\nconstantly thwarted as he has as much\nbad luck as Ferris has good.\nDon't be put off by the names of\nFerris and his friends Sloane and\nCameron (!)\u2014it is too unpredictable\na film to be classed as run of the mill\nAmerican drivel. It can be seen to be\na film about life, liberty and the\npursuit of personal freedom and it is\ngood for a change to see someone\nwith money who really knows how to\nspend it. Viv Watson.\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion- FELIX, Friday February 13th198716 STATE OF THE Last week's FELIX carried an\nopinion article written by Dave\nClements on the subject of RCSU, the\nconstitution and me. This term has\nseen several letters and articles\ncommenting on my lack of respect for\nthe RCSU constitution but, hopefully,\nhaving first discussed some more\ngeneral issues, I can go on to set the\nrecord straight.\nIn his article Dave stated that\ncharges within RCSU should be\nachieved by \"a process of evolution\nrather than revolution,\" and in no\nway would I wish to disagree with\nhim. Back in the autumn I wrote a long rambling article for FELIX\nbased entirely on the premise that\nRCSU has dismally failed to evolve\nover the past ten years, and, as the\narticle suggested, failure to evolve\neventually leads to extinction. The\nsimple fact that somebody like\nmyself, who has had no previous\ninvolvement with RCSU, could be\nelected President in a college-wide\nballot emphasises just how\ndisillusioned students were with their\nUnion.\nIf we try to analyse what makes a Union successful then the single most\nimportant element is breadth of\nappeal. If Joe Student can look at the\ndozen or so officers of a Union and\nidentify with one or two of them then\nJoe is going to feel that his Union\ncaters for people like himself. If\nduring the year Joe's Union holds one\nor two events which really appeal to\nJoe then he will feel that his Union\npartly reflects his own likes and\nattitudes. In the past RCSU has been\nentirely run by a 'select' group of\nindividuals with similar attitudes and\nsimilar ideas on how to enjoy\nthemselves. This led to RSCU being\none of the strongest cliques in College\nwith a whole range of very subtle\ntechniques to prevent any form of\ndeviation from the single well-trodden\npath.\nI 've spent the first six-months of\nthis year trying my utmost to bring\nin as many new faces to the Union as\npossible and hopefully, at the same\ntime I 've attempted to change those\nrules which hinder or discourage\npeople from getting involved. In\ncertain circumstances 1 have indeed\n! been devious and forceful, simply in\nA very special link\n' . ji.'. The Old Centralians is the alumni association\nof City and Guilds College.

The\nmajority of RCS officers presently\ndisagree with many of my proposals\nand if I can get any ideas to succeed\nthen there must be an element of\nvalidity in my approach.\nAs I 've said, I'm only President for\na short period of time and if things\nare going to change then I can't afford\nto pussyfoot around. Dave implies\nthat I personally have got nothing to\nlose in my attempts, but that the\nUnion could suffer irreparably if my\narguments are foolish and naive.\nFirstly, I have got a great deal to lose,\nand if I were sensible I would just sit\nback for twelve months and enjoy the\ndinners, the social activities and the\nvarious perks but instead I'm having\na go at trying to do something positive\nand if I'm wrong I'm going to suffer\ngreatly. The students of the Union can\nget rid of me in an instant if they feel\nthat I'm being in com pet ant but I know\nthat when I was elected President that\nit was on a manifesto which promised\nradical changes. Secondly, to say that\nI could damage the Union irreparably\nis a statement demonstrating the\nparanoia of Mr Clements\u2014whatever\nwonder o us powers I possess CCU\ndemolition is not one of them.\nDave also suggests that RCSU is\nnot in the best of health\u2014but then\nagain I wouldn't expect it to be after\nten years of stagnation. The good\nnews is that this year every single\naspect of RSCU is stronger than it was\nlast year\u2014mainly due to an influx of\nFirst Years who have given a somewhat broader appeal to the\nUnion simply by being involved. Ents\ntrips out will have involved over 500\nstudents by the end of the year,\nBroadsheet is the best it's been for\nyears, and even activities such as Jez\nand mascot ry are enjoying an increase\nin support.\nNow, back to some particular\npoints in Dave's article\u2014 I'd like to\nstart by complimenting Dave on his\nlogical and objective criticism and I'd also like to thank him for putting his\nname to his opinion article\u2014a somewhat unfashionable thing to do\nthese days. Firstly, Dave's account of\nthe Broadsheet episode is totally\ninaccurate as the entire process of the\nelection was as constitutional as it\ncould possibly have been, and\nsecondly the lack of an end of term\nUGM was due to the illness of the\nRCSU Hon Sec and by the time I had\nfound out about the situation no\nsuitable rooms were available. To say\nthat I \"purposely denied members of\nRCS of their democratic rights\" does\nsomewhat over drama tis e the\nsituation.\nSo. there we have it, I'm trying to\nchange things, and I'm not going to\napologise for that, and if the Union\nis stronger, healthier and more open\nas a result then I can graduate a happy\nstudent.\nSimon Singh.\nP.S. To the best of my knowledge\nand having scanned through Dave's article I haven't actually broken the\nconstitution...Yet!\nHOG'S BREATH BEER FESTIVAL\nFrom 12 noon\non Saturday 21st February\nfor\nONE WEEK SOUTH SIDEBAR During the week there will be\nabout 50 different cask-conditioned ales on sale on a rotational basis for you to\nsample and enjoy\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion. FELIX, Friday February 13th1987 hy Europe? This is one of\nthe most important questions in the\nWest today. It puzzles many people\nthat the UK should belong to\nEuropean organisations such as the\nEEC when the sole benefits, as\ndepicted by the media, are apparently:\nbutter mountains, grain mountains\nand wine lakes; endless petty\nsquabbling over seemingly\nincomprehensible problems, and\npampered, over-privileged Eurocrats.\nIt is unfortunate that these\nshortcomings in the infant Europe's political system serve solely to mask\nthe Treaty of Rome's ultimate goal:\nthe political unification of Europe.\nThe political unification of Europe\nmust strike most people as being, at\nbest, highly improbable; at worst,\ncompletely impractical, but there is\nan important historical precedent for\nthis step forward.\nIn the 1830s, Germany did not\nexist. In her place there writhed a rabble of disorganised monarchies\nsuch as Saxony, Baden-Baden or\nThurn and Taxis, which were\ninsignificant on a global scale. Trade\nbetween these states was impeded by\neach having its own customs, which\nwould often levy a duty and require\ndocuments to be in order before\nallowing goods though. This was a large constraint as it was often\nnecessary, during export, for goods\nto pass through two or three states\nbefore arriving at their destination. It\nsoon became obvious that this state\nof affairs was retarding the economic\ndevelopment of the whole region, in\nthese, the early days of the Industrial\nrevolution. In response, the\nZollverein, a treaty abolishing import\nduties and protectionism, was signed\nby the states concerned, effectively\ncreating a free trade zone. It had two\nprofound effects. The first was the\nevolution of the states' separate\neconomies into one, linking them\ninextricably despite their political\nindependence. The second was that\nthis economic interdependence led, a mere thirty years later, to the political\nunification of Germany. By the end\nof the century, Germany's Gross\nDomestic Product had surpassed\nGreat Britain's and was second only\nto that of the United States. This result\nis staggering, and was certainly not\ngenerally for seen. There are many important parallels\nwith what happened to Germany in\nthe 19th century and with the\nevolution of Europe in the late 20th century. The countries of Europe are\nsimply too small to be important on\na global scale compared with the USA\nand the USSR. Yet were they to unite\npolitically, they would be potentially\nas important as any other country is\nnow. There are enormous economic\nbenefits to be had from belonging to\na free economy of more than 100\nmillion people. One major benefit is\nthat the capacity of the internal market\nis sufficiently large to support any\nindustry, eliminating dependence on\nexport. In the UK, this is not so.\nHeavy industries such as large 5cale car or steel manufacture must seek\nmarkets abroad, contrasting\nsignificantly with the USA and Japan,\nwhich have the two largest economies\nin the world. It should be noted that\nthe EEC is, at least in principle if not\ntotally in practice, a free trade zone.\nThe economies of its member states\nhave become, and are still becoming,\npro ges st ve iy more integrated. For\nexample, French agriculture has\nbecome geared to this fact by\nproducing more fruit, which its\nMediterranean climate encourages,\nwhile decreasing its production of\nlivestock, which has been taken over\nby countries such as the Netherlands.\nThroughout the agriculture of the\nEEC, one observes a drift towards\nspecial is ation, which is one of the\nWhy Europe? David Bottomley assesses the Possibility of a United Europe\naims of the Common Agricultural\nPolicy.\nThe great nations of the world\ntoday are undoubtedly the USA and\nthe USSR, as are arguably China and\nJapan. If any nations are likely to join\ntheir ranks in the near future, they are\nBrazil and India. Yet the countries of\nEurope seem to have the necessary\ncredentials: fairly prosperous\neconomies and educated work forces. But the one major credential all the\ncountries of Europe lack is sheer size,\nand without this their influence\nglobally will continue to demi nish. A united Europe (or a united EEC at\nleast, since countries such as Sweden,\nSwitzerland and the Eastern Block\nseem unlikely to participate in a united Europe) would have a population of about 250 million,\nactually slightly larger than that of the\nUnited States, and would thus have\na potentially huge global influence. It\nis not necessarily for the use of this\ninfluence that Europe would want to\nunite, but rather to escape the\ninfluences of the super-powers, in\nparticular the United States with\nwhose foreign policy Europe is\nincreasingly ill at ease.\nIt is clear then, that there are good\nreasons for the UK to participate in\nthe political unification of Europe.\nYet there will be those who will ask\nwhy such an apparently favourable\nevent should not already have taken\nplace. The cynics will remark that the\ncultural differences across Europe are\nso huge as to make a politically-unified Europe a mere academics'\nfantasy. While it is true that linguistic\nand cultural barriers have presented,\nand will continue to present, a large\nobstacle to a unified Europe, it is\ntotally fallacious to assume that the\nexistence of such barriers\nautomatically implies a unified\nEurppe cannot be made to work and\na national identity arise. This, surely,\nis one of the great lessons of the\nUnited States of America, which\ncomprises not only people with roots\nin countries of the EEC, but includes\npeople with ancestors from the\nEastern Block; people of Jewish,\nJapanese or Puerto Rican ancestry,\nand numerous others. Furthermore,\nthere already exists within Europe\nvery strong evidence in organisations\nsuch as ESA, JET and CERN that\nEuropeans can work as successfully\ntogether (arguably even more\nsuccessfully) than people of any other\ngrouping. We should not look upon\nthe chaos in Brussels as how a politically united Europe would work.\nThe choice facing the countries of\nthe EEC is stark. Either they can\nbecome increasingly less prominent\nin the world, losing economic\nsignificance and political prestige, not\nat any particularly dramatic pace, but\nslowly, quietly, like a tired old man\nin his sunset days s slipping into\nobscurity as he drifts towards life's horizon, passing slowly away. Or\nthey can unite in the hope of a new\nRenaissance of the West, which will\nbe to the benefit of all the citizens of\nEurope.\nDavid Bottomley.\n\n"

In this\narticle we outline what we see as the\nmain problems of pollution in the air,\nin water and on land. Pollution is\nthe presence of any damaging\nsubstance at greater than naturally\noccurring levels in any part of the\nenvironment. We argue that\ninstitutional complacency on the\ngrounds of cost and lack of\ninformation over environmental\nproblems is no easier than reactive\nmeasures; furthermore it gives a lot\nof opportunities for industry to\ndevelop new applications of\nChemistry, Engineering and other\nsciences. \"Proof is not a product of\nScience but evidence is, and there is\nnow sufficient evidence of, not only\nadverse ecological effects, but also of\nfinancial costs of various pollutants.\nPollution used to be an acceptable\nside-effect of the demand for\nmanufactured goods but now we have\nreached the point at which it is costing\nindustry. For example, much of the\nactivity on Acid Rain is based\nstrongly on the possible economic\ndamage which could occur in the\nScandinavian Forestry industry.\nAcid Rain is the major pollution\nissue in the news today. The skies\nover Europe are more polluted than\nanywhere else on earth. The\nemission, mainly from cars and\npower stations, produce a complex\nchemical cocktail containing NOx and\nSO2, which in moist air form acids.\nThese acids cause toxic metals to be\nwashed out of soils into water\nsystems; an increased incidence of\nearly dementia in adults, caused by\nhigh Aluminium intake, has been\nreported in areas of Norway with high\nacid rain input. The impact on forests\nhas been devastating: 87% of German\ntrees are now damaged.\nThe UK contributes to the cocktail,\nthe Selby Coalfield power stations\nnow producing more air pollution\nthan Norway, Portugal, Ireland and\nSwitzerland together. Abatement has\nbeen slow due to disagreement\nbetween EEC countries over\nimplementation of legislation and\nactual limits set. The CEGB is now\nfitting de sulphur is ation equipment to\njust 3 power stations whereas East\nGermany and Czechoslovakia have\nagreed to introduce anti-pollution\nequipment to 30 power stations.\nThere has been increasing concern\nrecently over observations of a significant decrease in the ozone\nlayer, particularly over the Antarctic\nwhere a \"hole\" has appeared and is\ngrowing larger. Chlorofluorocarbons,\nfound in aerosols, solvents and\nrefrigerants, are thought to have\ncaused this reduction, through\ninterference with free radical\nreactions in the upper atmosphere.\nThis layer protects us from potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation. A1% decrease in this layer is thought to\nresult in a6% increase in the\noccurrence of disfiguring skin cancer.\nIrreversible climatic changes may also\noccur.\nAs usual, the International\nCommunity is split on how to tackle\nthe problem. However, there was a gleam of hope on the holding of the\nVienna Convention on the Protection\nof the Ozone Layer in March 1985,\nit being the first of its kind on global\npollution. Hopefully, a precedent has\nbeen set for united action on other\nworldwide pollution problems.\nThe other major issue of this nature\nis the build up of CO2 in the\natmosphere. This is thought to be\ncausing increasingly unstable weather\nand it was suggested this was the\ncause of the recent cold spell over the\nNorthern Hemisphere. In addition\nthere is fear that it will result in a general global warming (the so-called\nGreenhouse Effect).\nCoastal pollution is a problem\nrarely highlighted by press coverage:\nonly the oil tanker disasters such as\nthe Torry Canyon and the Amoco\nCadiz make the headlines. Sewage is\npumped into the sea in many places\naround the coast, usually at a distance\ntoo close inshore so that the phrase\nbeing \"in the s xxx\" takes on a new\nmeaning: there is evidence to suggest\nthat swimming on such beaches\nincreases the risk of catching disease,\neg polio! 25 beaches in the West\nCountry failed to meet EEC standards. Again the benefits of\npollution control can be seen: Local\nAuthorities have been instructed to\nclean up our beaches at a cost of about\n\u00a3400 million. Better treatment of\nsewage although more costly at the\ntime of treatment would have been\nless costly in the long run.\nOf the pollutants pouring into\nBritain's waterways, the various\npesticides and fertilizers which are\nused in farming are causing most\nconcern. Nitrates have two worrying\neffects: they cause eu troph i cation in\nlakes, etc. enhancing growth of algae\nresulting in de oxygenation of the\nwater and subsequent loss of fish.\nMore worrying is the effect on human\nhealth: as with so many things there\nis thought to be a carcinogenic effect,\nbut it is also well known that high\nnitrate levels cause asphyxiation in\nyoung children, the so called Blue\nbaby syndrome. There is much\nevidence to suggest that nitrates have\nleached through to the ground water\nsupplies which provide water to many\nparts of southern and eastern Britain.\nAlmost a million consumers in the\nMidlands and East Anglia drink water\nwhich contains greater than 50mg of\nnitrate per litre, which is prescribed\nas safe by the EEC.\nRiver pollution was recently\n\n"

Friday February\n6th) is still at large. Last week an IC\nstudent was approached by the man\nwhilst walking between Queensgate\nand Gloucester Road. The student\nwas asked \u00bbfor \u00a31,100 and offer red two watches and a bracelet, which he\nwas told were made of gold, for\nsecurity. The man's story was that he\nhad all his money pinched in a casino\nand needed to get home; he speaks\nwith a French accent.\nThe man is described as being\naround forty years old, of dark\nbrownish complexion with a broad\nface. He was wearing a grey suit and\ndriving a white car, possibly an\nAustin-Rover, which he said was\nhired.\nAnyone who is approached by this\nman should contact College security\nchief Geoffrey Reeves immediately.\nUGC to dissolve\nKenneth Baker, Secretary of State for\nEducation has welcomed a report\ncalling for the dissolution of the\nUniversity Grants Committee. The\nreport of the Croham Committee,\npublished on Tuesday, recommends\nthat the UGC be replaced by a smaller\nCouncil.\nThe Croham Report also\nrecommends that Universities receive\nfunding on a three year basis, with no\ncuts during each period except in\ntimes of national emergency.\nAmongst the other key\nrecommendations of the report are a re-appraisal of negotiating\narrangements for academic salaries\nand a re-examination of the funding\nfor medical education.\nThe proposed University Grants\nCouncil would be chaired, suggests\nthe report, by 'an eminent figure from\noutside the academic world', assisted\nby a full time Director General, who\nwould act as Accounting Officer for\ngrants to universities, and a formal\ndocument detailing the relationship\nbetween the Government and the\nUGC would be drawn up.\nIt's the thought that counts\nThe National Union of Students has\nbeen protesting vigorously against the\nintroduction of student loans over the\nlast few weeks. The highlight of the\ncampaign was to have been to padlock\nexecutive members to a large pyramid\nstructure entitled 'Debt'.\nThe NUS President, Vicky Phillips,\nwas to have symbolically unlocked\nthem with a key labelled \"Living\nGrant', all of which was planned to\ntake place outside 10 Downing Street.\nUnfortunately the construction team\nbuilt 'Debt' out of papier-mac he and\nonly realised that it was too big to get\nout of the door on the morning of the\nevent. As an NUS spokesman put it\nlater, \"so great is the debt around\nstudents' necks they can't even get out\nof doors in the morning!\"\n'Secret Society' screened\nA reporter from FELIX was among\na large audience who saw a screening\nof the banned BBC film \"Secret\nSociety\" on Monday evening. The\nevent was organised by the Campaign\nfor Press and Broadcasting Freedom\nat Conway Hall, near Holborn. The\nmeeting was later addressed by a series of speakers including Mrs Ann\nClywd MP and Mr Tony Benn MP\nwho have both been involved in\nprotests over the Zircon censorship\nscandal.\nMr Duncan Campbell, the\njournalist who made the film, was\nunable to be present during the actual\nscreening due to an injunction. A fuller report of the program will\nappear in FELIX next week.\nPG Handbook\npublished\nThe Postgraduate Handbook for 1987\nwas published this week. The\nhandbook is aimed at final year\nstudents at IC who are thinking of\npostgraduate study here. It contains\ninformation on how to apply, funding\nand eligibility for grants and fees. It\nalso features a section written by\ncurrent postgraduates, both MSc's and PhD's, at the College, and is\nintended to give a student's idea of\nwhat it is like to be a Postgraduate at\nImperial. Special sections included\nthis year are chapters on Postgraduate\nlife as a woman, and as an overseas\nstudent.\nCopies are available free from the\nUnion office, and it is hoped that they\nalso can be distributed around the\nDepartments very shortly.\nULU March\nA march to the headquarters of the\nUGC will take place later this month.\nThe march, which is part of the\nUniversity of London Union's campaign against the proposed cut in central funding, will be addressed by\nNUS President Vicky Phillips, and\nwill leave the ULU building at about\nnoon on the 26th of February. ULU\nPresident Jane Cannon told FELIX\nthat the route, from Malet Street to\nPark Crescent, has been approved by\nthe police, and she urged students to\ngive their support to the campaign.\nStorm in a pot\nThe RCSU's \"three-handled pot\"\ndisappeared mysteriously last Friday\nduring the RCS Annual Dinner, held\nat the London International Hotel on\nCromwell Road. The pot was\ndiscrete ly returned, via Sherfield\nSecurity, on Saturday.\nCan't make\nwaves\nImperial College Radio's medium\nwave transmitter was shut down on\nWednesday night. The transmitter,\nwhich is housed in a service duct\nbelow Southside, was damaged by\nwater leaking from a pipe.\nTechnical Manager Dave Stanley\ntold FELIX that he expects to have\nthe transmitter repaired in time to go\nback on air this Saturday evening. IC\nRadio is continuing with its normal\nprogramming meanwhile, and can\nstill be heard over the network system\nin many parts of College.\nStrong social\nHabits\nThe Student Accommodation Office\nhas reported a very strong response\nto the Social Habits Survey. By\nWednesday morning the number of\nreplies received had already exceeded\npeak predictions. With some returns\nstill to filter through the internal mail\nnext week the organisers are facing\nthe problem that the original computer\nsystem selected for processing the\nstatistics may be unable to cope.\nReaction to the questionnaire appears\nto have been very positive with only\na few forms incomplete or spoiled.\nUnder starters\norders\nThe sabbatical election papers went\nup yesterday, and already several\ncandidates have put their names up.\nThe only post with more than one\ncandidate is that of FELIX editor,\nwith Chris Edwards (Chemistry) and\nJudith Hackney (Physics) standing.\nFor the other posts, the following\npeople have put their names up: Bill\nGoodwin (Mechanical Engineering)\nfor President, Alan Rose (Dept. of\nComputing) for Deputy President,\nand Chas Jackson (Chemical\nEngineering) for Honorary Secretary.\nUGM\npostponed\nTuesday's Union General Meeting\nwas postponed because of a lack of\npublicity. The ICU Executive decided\nto move the UGM to Tuesday of next\nweek (February 17th), at 1.00pm in\nthe Great Hall.\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews FELIX, Friday February 13th198713 The Fly THEATRE The A men Corner\nThe Fly (1958) was a film in which\na scientist, whilst experimenting with\na matter transmitter he had built,\naccidently gets mixed up with a fly.\nThe scientist acquires the head and\none foreleg of the fly, and the fly\nacquires his head and arm. The film\nwas remarkable not only for the\nunusually large amount of money\nspent on it but for the morbid\nattraction that its man-fly image\nholds. Nevertheless, the film had one\nbig logic problem. The fly's head the\nscientist acquires somehow still has\nhis brain, as he finally persuades his\nwife to kill him in a hydraulic press.\nHowever, the fly with the man's head\nalso seems to have his brain, as the\nfilm ends with it trapped in a spider's web shouting for help as an arachnid\nbears down on it. Matter transmission\nand a fly are all David Cronenberg's remake have in common with the\noriginal.\nSeth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is the\nscientist who discovers the secret of\nteleportation. His first experiments\nmisfire\u2014but he solves the problems,\nand finally tests the device out on\nhimself. Except that he shares the\nteleportation both with a fly. And\nwhen he re materialise s in the\nreceiving booth, he is\u2014alright. But\nthe fly has disappeared. And Seth\nslowly begins to change; his skin\nd is colours, he develops an animal-like\nstrength, his sex drive increases, At\nfirst it's something he jokes about.\nThen he thinks it's cancer. But finally,\ninter o gating the computer which\ncontrols the teleportation process, he\ndiscovers the truth.\nThe Fly is about the loss of external\nhumanity, and the effect this has on\nthe inner man. Jeff Goldblum gives\na superb performance, even when, in\nthe latter stages of the film, he is\nhidden behind layers of make-up. His\ndepiction of the bumbling scientist\nwho suddenly finds his body revolting\nagainst him is heart rending.\n(Goldblum is a strong candidate for\nan Academy nomination).\nAlso giving worthy performances\nare Geena Davis as a reporter who\nagrees to cover Brundle's discovery,\nand John Getz as Stathis Borans,\neditor of a physics magazine\n'Particle'. Both play a large part in\nthe film's highly suspenseful, exciting\nand ultimately emotional finale.\nDirector and co-writer David\nCronenberg has up-dated the story of\nthe 1958 film, and stays within the\nscientific boundaries which he defines\nfor himself. That is to say that\nalthough he uses such ideas as matter\ntransmission and 'chroma so mal fusion', he doesn't then go and spoil\nthe film by introducing some totally\nillogical phenomenon. He\nacknowledges that transmission of the\nactual atoms of an object is not\nThe Fringe Theatre may have some\ndisadvantages, but one great asset is\nits ability to provide you with\nsomething completely different. The\nAmen Corner at the Tricycle Theatre\nuntil February 28th, is exactly that\u2014\nand much more besides.\nAs a member of the white middle-class, James Baldwin's play took me\ninto a whole new world\u2014that of black\nHarlem in the 1950's. The storyline is a simple one: that\nof a woman seeking refuge in the\nchurch to escape a drunk husband and\nthe death of a baby; a woman who has\nburied herself so deeply in her beliefs,\nthat when the Husband returns and the\nson wishes to leave, she starts to\ncrack; a woman for whom reality\noccurs to others.\nWhat really makes this production\nso believable is the atmosphere\ncreated in the 'store front church'.\nCoupled with the intimacy of the\ntheatre, we become part of the\ncongregation during the church\nservices, but feel like eavesdroppers\nduring the more personal moments\nsuch as the touching reunion of Pastor\nMargaret (Carmen Munroe) and her\nestranged husband (Al Matthews): \"If\nonly we could start again.\"\nThe show, almost three hours long\nwith two intervals, goes exceptionally\nquickly\u2014almost too quickly as Pastor\nMargaret is forced, somewhat\nbrutally, to realise the limitations of\nher particular style of faith. Ms\nMunroe is excellent in this role, and\nis admirably backed up by a talented\ncast all of whom have managed to put\na real zeal into their performances.\nAlthough one or two scenes may\nappear a touch over-directed, it isn't hard for the audience to have fun and\nconcentrate when the actors on stage\nare obviously enjoying themselves so\nmuch with the rare humour and the\npossible. So in his version of The Fly\nthe object or person is reconstructed\nusing a 'plasma pool' as a source of\nraw matter. The result of the\nchroma so mal fusion is that Seth\nBrundle sL \"tam or p hoses into\nan organism that is a sort of half-way\npoint between a man and a fly. All\nthis may sound trivial, but more often\nthan not it's this sort of thing that\ntreated illogically, totally spoils an\notherwise good story.\nYou'll definitely need a strong\nstomach to see this film but\nunpleasantness aside it's a real tear-jerk er. As Brundle's physical\nhumanity is slowly disintegrated by\nthe literal 'fly in the ointment' his\nmake-up challenges us, the audience,\nto stick by him when no one else but\nhis new found reporter girlfriend will.\nBrundle finally faces what is\nhappening to him, and quotes Kafka;\n\"I am an insect who dreamed he was\na man and now the dream is over.\"\nCharles Robin\nirrepressible music. But as Luke says\nto his son, on the eve of his leaving\nhome, \"Music is just a moment, life\nis a long time.\" This production is\nwell worth such a momentary visit\u2014\nand much more besides.\nAidan Kershaw.\nThe Merry\nWives of\nWindsor\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company has\nrecently brought back its production\nof the Merry Wives of Windsor, now\nplaying at the Barbican, and how wise\nthey were. Merry Wives is arguably\nthe most comical of all the\nShakespeare comedies, and this\nproduction effortlessly plays on all the\nfarcical elements right to the hilt.\nTo claim that the cast were slick\nwould be a gross understatement, they\nwere completely a tune with both the\nlines and each other\u2014the effect was\nto produce a superb show. Set in the\n1950's, the designer William Dudley\n(who received the Laurence Olivier\nDesign Award for this show), takes\nus back to days of Morris Minors,\njive music, mods and rockers and the\nsexual oppression of women.\nIn fact the sexual politics of the play\nare all very much tongue-in-cheek,\npurely so that they may be knocker!\ndown later, when the women finally\n'discredit' Sir John Falstaff. Sir John,\nplayed by Peter Jeffrey, assumes that\nhe may seduce, through his natural\ncharms, two 'wives of Windsor'. All\ndoes not go to plan, and they lead him\na merry dance to prove his arrogance.\nThrow in the subplot of a mixed up\ncourtship (almost obligatory to\nShakespeare's comedies) and you\nhave the usual complex plot. But the\nbeauty of this pro uc tion is that within\nminutes, we forget that the language\nis over three hundred years old, and\nfind no problem following the story.\nThis of course is due to superb\nperformances from all the cast, but\nnotably Sheila Staefel in the role of\nMistress Quickly. Ms Staefel has\nmagnificent timing and can provoke\nlaughter from the most mundane of\nlines. Several rounds of applause\ncame her way for beautifully\ncontrolled comic moments during\nscene changes, although credit for\nthese must also go to Bill Alexander\n(Director, winner of Laurence Olivier\nDirector Award) whose direction was\nconsistently on the mark. The farcical\naspects were all wonderfully\nperformed, especially Mistresses\nFord's and Page's conversation under\nthe hair dryers, and for comedy this\nshow cannot be beaten\u2014who said\nShakespeare is dull?\nAidan Kershaw\n\n"

Boating from the\nCambridge boat house at Ely,\nSaturday's training was to involve two\n15 minute races along the Ouse.\nWith Cambridge in their famous\nlight blue colours and Imperial in a newly designed bright blue top, the\ntwo boats were ready. Using a running start, Cambridge were about\na man up when the race was started\n(by the Cambridge coach). Although\nCambridge went ahead early on, a spirited effort though out the race\nresulted in a verdict of only 5 lengths\nto Cambridge, who had expected an\neasy 10 length victory. The second\npiece was far tougher, and although\nCambridge again got a length ahead\nearly on, they were unable to break\nthe IC crew, who even came back at\nCambridge after about 9 minutes.\nWith both crews rowing flat out,\nrating about 34 for most of the race,\nthe race could have gone either way,\nbut, unable to push through the light\nblues, Imperial eventually lost by 1 Vi\nlengths\u2014a very commendable\nperformance against such a high\nranking crew.\nSunday's race was the most\nexciting. A single 5 minute sprint!\nWith a superb start, Imperial took a length off the light blues and held it\nfor 3 minutes, rating about 37 to their\n36. At this point Cambridge gave\neverything, and pushed through to\nsnatch their third victory, but only by\nVi a length. At the end, both crews,\nhardly surprisingly, collapsed!

IC\nnow had 10 players and 9 sticks. A timely cross from Sandra Rofe\nbrought Alison Seward her second\ngoal.

FELIX, Friday February 13th1987 The Odd\nCouple?\nDear Dave,\nI wonder if any of your readers\nnoticed the resemblance between\nPeter Goosen (IC Amnesty Chairman)\nand Simon Bosher (Third Secretary\nof the South African Embassy). I wonder if they are somehow related.\nYour ever faithful servant,\nEna B Maxwell.\nFoolish biker\nDear Dave,\nThe Irate Biker who complained\nabout having his lights taken for the\nnight and then returned is a fool who\ndeserves to have not only his lights\nbut his whole bike stolen and never\nreturned. Someone should point out\nto him that the \u00a31.80 he paid in bus\nfares is a lot less than the cost of\nbuying a new set of lights and\nbatteries, and if it teaches him never\nto leave his lights unattended again,\nhe should consider it money well\nspent.\nYours sincerely,\nSecurity-Conscious Student\nP.S. Buy my next week's shopping\nat Sainsbury's? Question of\nmorals\nDear Dave,\nOn behalf of the Christian Union\nI would like to draw to your attention\nhow the recent Welfare survey fails\nto provide a \"truly complete picture\nof the IC student population.\" We\nunderstand such a survey is necessary\nbut many of us have found it assuming\nin regards to the behaviour of students\nhere. This mostly concerns Q.21 which gives no option to state whether\none not is in a sexual relationship at\nthe moment, except by not answering\nthe question and so leaving room for\nspeculation.\nSome have also found the options\nfor answer in Q.17( that on the\nreasons why one doesn't drink)\nincomplete. It neglects that some\npeople find simply the taste of alcohol\ndispleasing or moral grounds rather\nthan religious ones (there is a distinction) can cause some not to\ndrink.\nThe question of morals must also\nbe raised with the issue of sex and\ndrugs. The opportunity to state one's morals to the question of drink is\ngiven but not for that of sex or drugs.\nAlthough Welfare may have good\nreasons to do this we are concerned\nthat drugs and especially sex are\npresented outside of any moral\ncontext.\nPlease understand that we know\nthat this survey was hurriedly\nproduced and went out before the\nExec could review it. I do hope\nthough that these feelings will be\nnoted and taken into account for\nfurther such surveys.\nYours sincerely,\nSteve Clark, ICCU.\nDisco\nFiasco\nDear Dave,\nHaving been to the Southside disco\nlast Friday, run, supposedly, by \"4th Day of the Week,\" we would like to\nhave said what are fe shing change it\nwas from the normal inane \"dance\naround a handbag\" drivel that we're\nusually confronted with.\nAnd so it was, until 9.45pm. At\nleast several of us thought it was.\nApparently several IC Radio hacks\ndid not. They took offence to the\nalternative type of music being played\n(which they obviously were not\nfamiliar with\u2014so how could it\npossibly be any good?) which was\napparently not inspiring enough\npeople to dance. Two of them\nproceeded to take over the disco,\nreturning to old relics such as Tainted\nLove. Blue Monday and various other\nblasts from the past.\nIsn't it about time our IC Radio\nfriends took off their blinkers and\nrealised there is life outside of a few\n\"played to death\" records from the\ntop 20. If IC Radio do cia im the\ndancing increased later on due to their\ndivine intervention I suggest they go\nto IC discos more often. The vast\nmajority of people end up dancing\nafter 10.30pm anyway.\nFar from turning the disco into\nsomething better. IC Radio have only\nrevealed their narrow-mindedness\nwhich caused several people to leave\nearly rather than stay.\nS Smith, Chem II,\nN Hardy, Computing II\nJones\nRant 1\nTo the Editor,\nComments on last week's FELIX.\n1) Why doesn't that prat 'Mark' the\ncartoonist fuck off.\n2) You demonstrate a complete pig\nignorance of the situation in South\nAfrica by the use of the term\n'coloured' in last week's editorial\nwhich I'm afraid is rather typical of\nmany people who are apparently so\nconcerned about the situation in that\ncountry. The term 'coloured' applies\nto people of mixed black-white\nparentage. The terms 'black' and\n'white' and 'Asian' are self\nexplanatory, Using the term\n'coloured' in the context it appears in\nthe editorial implies a certain lack of\nrespect for people who are not as\nwhite as yourself.\n3) Nosmo King's letter was by far\nthe best letter 1 have seen in FELIX\nthis or any year. It's a pity there aren't more like them (including this one).\nYours sincerely,\nMike Jones, Mining Geology PC\nRant 2\nDear Dave,\nA rewrite of my first letter to you\nwhich, having spoken to you, was\noverly critical and I apologise. Please\nfeel free to publish both (or neither\nas you see fit!)\nHaving spent ten months of the past\ntwo years of my life in South Africa\none of the things that incenses me\nduring discussion of the situation in\nthat country is the arb it ary use of such\nterms as 'black' and 'coloured'. I appreciate now that you used the term\n'coloured' in last week's editorial as\na result of a need for editorial brevity.\nIt did however create a rather naive\nand uncaring impression of your\nunderstanding of racial problems in\nSouth Africa and even this country.\nIn multiracial societies it is\nunfortunate that there is a problem of\ndescribing groups of people of\ndifferent skin colour. Non-white\n(another terrible term I'm afraid)\npeople I have worked with in South\nAfrica and the UK cannot abide being\nlumped together in one racial group\neven for the sake of brevity and they\nare extremely sensitive about it. In\nSouth Africa the racial situation is\nextremely complex and not just a simple 'black vs white' problem.\nThere are several other racial groups\nin South Africa who seem to get\noverlooked in the general hurry to get\non the \"solidarity with black South\nAfricans\" bandwagon and it is that\nsort of attitude of complete ignorance\nof the problems facing South Africa\nthat is annoying. I realise it was not\nyour intention to create the impression\nyou did. and I regret having thought\nit was. but I feel it illustrates how\ncareful one must be when\ncommenting on such sensitive issues.\nOn a lighter note, I still stand by\nmy remark concerning \"Mark\" the\ncartoonist who is extremely tedious\nand Nosmo King's letter which is still\nthe best letter I 've read in FELIX.\nYours,\nMike Jones\nMining Geology PG\nAbhorent\nDear Dave,\nI, John Noble, find the practice of\nwriting letters to FELIX just to get\none's name in print quite abhor ent. Yours,\nJohn Noble.\nLove is criminal This subject is perhaps a bit heavy\nfor the FELIX Valentine's Day\nissue\u2014but while everyone's thoughts\nturn to love (am I kidding? Does\nanyone think of anything else?) it\nseems relevant.\nIn 1985, 37 men were imprisoned\nfor an average of 22 months for\nhaving consensual sex. All the men\nwere over 21, and had had some kind\nof sexual involvement with men of an\nage between 16 and 21. Why?\nBecuase the age of consent for\nhomosexual men is 21.\nThis crime doesn't exist for\nheterosexuals or lesbians (a historical\naccident\u2014reputedly Queen Victoria\ndidn't believe there was such a thing\nas a lesbian. Incidentally this also\nshows how out-dated the law is).\nA recent court case heard that 2\npolicemen spent 3 hrs in the men's toilet of a gay club when they were\nin fact meant to be out on the beat.\nThe judge threw the case out. It's a shame the two policemen couldn't have been out on the beat trying to\nconvict muggers instead of ty ring to\nconvict innocent people.\nHave you ever wondered why you\nnever see gay men and women\nwalking hand-in-hand? Surely, it's the\nmost natural thing for lovers to do?\nThe reason is that this is also i lie gal under public decency laws.\nLast year when a man and women\nstripped in public and pro ceded to\nengage in intercourse local residents\ncalled the police and the couple were\n\"moved on\" and not charged\u2014and\nyet gay men are spied upon in private.\n(Incidently a locked hotel room is not\nconsidered \"private\" within the law).\nSo, when you are having fun this\nweekend spare a thought for\n\"harrassed-homos\" and give him a. kiss from me.\nLove Robert.\nSERVICING & REPAIRS\nat\nRICKY' S GARAGE( Personal service guaranteed)\n19 QUEENS GATE PLACE MEWS SOUTH KENSINGTON\nLONDON S.W.7 Tel: 01 589 1589\n\n"

    "content": "The Newspaper Of Imperial College Union Founded 1949\nGU C condemns occupation of Northern Ireland\nThe University of London's General Union Council (GUC)\npassed a motion condemning the British occupation of Northern\nIreland at their meeting on Tuesday. The council felt that the\npartition of Ireland into North and South went against the\nwishes of the Irish people, and that Britain should commit itself\nto un conditioned military withdrawal. Also criticised was the\nuse of plastic bullets, the 'Diplock' trials without jury, and the\nuse of strip searches.\nThe motion was passed in spite of\na passionate speech by IC Union Hon\nSec, Dave Coliey, denouncing the\natrocities committed by the INLA and\nthe IRA. A call by ICU External\nAffairs Officer Adrian Johnson for\nthe motion not to be voted upon was\ndefeated after a recount by 5 votes.\nFollowing the NUS condemnation\nof the level of grants, the GUC\ndecided to adopt a policy condemning\nstudent loans, the lack of grants for\nstudents in further e duct ion, and the\n'Fowler Review' which restricts the\naccess of students to benefits.\nA motion designed to protect the\nrights of AIDS sufferers to use\nUniversity and Union facilities\nwithout discrimination was also\npassed. The motion criticises the view\nthat AIDS is a 'gay disease' and can\nbe transmitted by social contact. It\nstates that gay people and drug users\nshould not be automatically debarred\nfrom giving blood, and calls for the\nGovernment to undertake a major\nAIDS research programme.\nThe charity 'Quest for a Test for\nCancer' was supported, and it was\ndecided to send two delegates to a tandem rally designed to raise funds\nfor the charity. The motion calls for\nthe adoption of a new cancer test\ndeveloped by Quest which could\nprevent thousands of deaths from\ncervical cancer. The charity is\ncurrently trying to raise money for\ntwenty regional centres.\nFinally a motion calling for the\nresignation of the Senator for law,\nresponsible for representing the views\nof the University of London Union\n(ULU) to the University's governing\nbody proved highly controversial.\nThe Senator was criticised for not\nsupporting the council's views on the\nULU cuts and marches, and for the\nnon-attendance of meetings. Under\nthe council's constitution the Senator\nis obliged to uphold the policies of the\nGUC, though the council has no\npower to sack Senators for not doing\nso. The Senator said that, in spite of\nthe request, he had no intention of\nresigning.\nTV star moves in next\ndoor to Rector\nThe cameras rolled on Queensgate\nthis Monday, as the actor Paul\nNicholas took part in Bust, a new six-part drama series for LWT which is\nto be shown in October.

A friend offers~him a flat in Radnor\nPlace on Queensgate, next to the\nRector's rooms at number 170.\nMr Nicholas commented that the\nfirst few episodes might show him\nlooking rather miserable, as they were\nfilmed in Lambeth last month when\nthe temperature was \u20147\u00b0C. \"It's almost impossible to smile\nwhen your face is frozen stiff,\" he\nexplained, grimacing for the benefit\nof our camera.\nWhen filming in Queensgate\nfinishes, the crew will be moving to\nGrosvenor Crescent.\nINSIDE\nThis week's edition of your\nfun-packed FELIX\nNigel Whitfield's Valentine's Day\nSmall Ads Special\nCentre pages\nEnvironmental\nWeek\nThe question of\nworld pollution .. pg 6\nOpinion\nCalls for a united\nEurope pg 9\nEllis into\nWonderland\nExpose on Lewis ,\nCarroll pg 1/\nPlus:\nSport, What's On,\nReviews and your\nfavourite gossip!\nFree Friday February 13th1987 No. 763\n\n"

FELIX, Friday February 13th198714 Sailing, Sunday 8th February, Queen Mary\nReservoir\nGreat combination\nLast Sunday the IC sailing team\nwound their way to Queen Mary\nreservoir, by Heathrow, for a match\nagainst The City University. Despite\nthe blustery conditions and unfamiliar\nboats, the IC team won in convincing\nstyle, putting up their best\nperformance of the season so far. In\na series of races that lasted all day,\nthe team won 8 races against City's2. The first race set the scene with\ngood work from helms Charles\nOxley, Apostolous Leonhidopolous,\nand Richard Brimelow creating an\nunbeatable 1, 2, 3 combination. With\naggressive starting tactics and\nsuperior boat speed the teams,\nencouraged by Captain Sam Page,\nimproved though out the day to win 5\nof the 10 races sailed, with a1,2,3 combination. (What is a1,2,3, combination ?)\nTeam: Sam Page (Capt),\nRichard Brimelow, Charles Oxley,\nRichard Jarman, Apostolous\nLeonhidopolous.\nBadminton \u2014\nHammersmith Leagues\nMixed luck in leagues\nfor IC teams\nMens\nAfter a very promising start to our\nfirst season in Hammersmith Division\n3 our luck has changed, since the 3\nmatches played so far this term have\nonly yielded one victory. They were\ncrucial matches as well, and it now\nlooks as though IC are out of the\nrunning for promotion.\nThe slide started against Acton,\nwhom we convincingly beat last term,\non their courts. It was a combination\nof not having a full team and lack of\n(practise from the team as a whole.\nHowever, despite our firsts having no\ntrouble winning all of their 3 rubbers\nActon still made short work of our\nremaining pairs to win 6-3.\nThe slide continued 2 days later\nwhen we were beaten 6-3 by\nSpartans\u2014surely the favourites for\npromotion. IC played better than they\nhad in the match before, but could\nonly manage victories against the\nvisitors' third pair.\nThe following day we hit back with\naven gence by thrashing Friday Night\n9:0. It was a different standard of\nbadminton\u2014much lower\u2014but a9:0 victory may be vitally important\nshould IC beat Spartans in return.\nMixed\nThe mixed is a bit of a foregone\nconclusion this year. Our team is too\nstrong for the division we have been\nput in and this is reflected in the\nresults. IC have won every match\nexcept one (the result of having 2\nmatches on the same night) and every\nvictory (7 in all) has been 9:0 (again,\nexcept one, which we won 5:4 having\nonly had 2 pairs!)\nThis term is no exception as our\nopponents have found\u2014Grange a..' Richmond both being thrashed by the\nabove margin.\nThe mixed team should not have\nmuch problem maintaining this form\nfor their last 2 matches.\nFootball\nIC 2nd XI 7, QMC II 7\npure poetry\nTension was high (Wos it\u2014Ed) in this\ncrunch game, as 4 points were up for\nthe taking. A2nd XI led by the\ncharismatic Captain Neil McDonald\nquickly took control. After some\nfluent play M Housby pounced on a through ball and slid the ball past the\nkeeper, to make the score 1-0.\nWith Paul Stott in powerful form\nin attack, IC swept forward and\nclaimed more goals. Stott's clever\ncross pinpointed to the head\n(Ouch!\u2014Ed) of a QMC defender who\nthundered the ball past his helpless\ngoalkeeper. (Phew! what a paragraph).\nAnother goal by Housby,\ncomplemented a fine low drive by\nScott Gordon and a20 yard cracker\nfrom Jez Holland. A dubious penalty\ndecision after D Demeria, who\ncontrolled the right flank, had\nallegedly pushed a QMC player,\nallowed QMC to pull a goal back.\nIC entered the second half with the\ncrowd firmly behind them. They\nFootball, Saturday\nFebruary 7th, Egham\nIC 3rds0, Goldsmiths\n2nds2 added to their tally after a glorious\nmove. P Stott, after a display of\nsilken, elegant skills chipped the ball\nto Scott Gordon in the box, who\nheaded the ball back for the Captain,\nNeil McDonald, to volley home\nemphatically. 6-1 to IC.\nQMC rallied and only excellent\nplay from S Dunthorne in defence and\nthe tenacious Dave Viles in midfield\nprevented QMC pulling a goal back.\nJ Wireford was called upon to make\nsome important saves to deny QMC.\nThe game was sealed by M Housby\ncompleting his hat rick after D Viles,\nD Semera, P Scott and Scott Gordon\nhad created numerous chances.\nSo IC march 'on' up the division\n'and' prepare 'for' the cup semi-final\non 'Saturday'. M Barrow is '73'.\nTeam: J Wreford, C Gordon, J Holland, S Dunthorne, Ken\nHolroyd, N McDonald (Capt), D Viles, Scott Gordon, D Semera, M Housby, Paul Scott.\nOn Saturday the 3rds travelled to New\nCollege in Egham for their Upper\nReserves Cup Semi-final. Their\nopponents, Goldsmiths 2nds, although a division higher, had not\nwon a league game all season; the\ngame was going to be close.\nIC 3rds quickly grabbed the\ninitiative with sweeping breaks down\nthe left, embarrassing our opponents'\nfull-back and whipping in some good\ncrosses. Goldsmiths were restricted\nto a few swift counter-attacks, dealt\nwith cool y by the 3rds defence.\nHaving forced a succession of comers\nKevin Graves went close, shooting\nwide with only the keeper to beat. The\nsame player had a second chance a moment later, but was unlucky to be\n'offside'. Wendel Charles and Martin\nDixon made intelligent running, ably\nsupported by the bustling Paul\nThompson and Mark Radley\nproviding width on the right.\nTremendous team football forced a goal, but it was disallowed for a rather\ndubious offside decision. Goldsmith's responded well with an opportunist\ngoal; a tow-poke shot past a deceived\nMike Kemp.\n1-0 down at half-time, the 3rds surged forward in the second half.\nKevin Graves turned and chipped\nsuperbly, only to be denied by a tremendous flying save. Two Paul\nThompson cross-shots were similarly\nthwarted. Kevin Graves and Russ\nDark headed over and Martin Lake\nshot just wide from the edge of the\nbox. Tempers flared mid-way through\nthe second half and Chris Gordon\nwon his own personal battle with his\nopponent. After a running-down-the-touch line boxing match, he seemed to\nblow a fuse and buckled his opponent\nfrom behind with a calculated blow\nto the shin. The absence of the ball\nseemed irrelevant. Justice was done,\nhowever, as Goldsmith scored\ndirectly from the resulting free-kick.\nWendel Charles was bundled down\nin the box but claims for a penalty\nwere ignored. Having virtually\ncamped in our opponent's half and\ncreating numerous chances more, it\nwas not to be our day; Goldsmith's goalkeeper made another fine save to\nsecure the match. A great team\nperformance partially covered our\ndisappointment, but everybody played\nabove themselves and thoroughly\nenjoyed a fast, competitive game of\nfootball. Thanks to Hideo Takans,\nwho came to support us despite his\nrecently acquired broken leg, for his\nvocal comments and also Chris\nRedgen, cruelly denied an appearance\nin the team due to injury, for his\nsupport also.\nA game to be remembered by all\non a day when lady luck wasn't there\nto help us get the win we deserved.\nTeam: Mike Kemp, Chris\nGordon, Martin Lake, Mark\nWoodgate (C), Russ Dark, Mike\nPlummer, Paul Thompson, Kevin\nGraves, Mark Radley, Wendel\nCharels, Martin Dixon.\nTension, charisma and\n\n"

    "content": "Feature FELIX, Friday February 13th198717E ll is in wonderland Chris Stapleton talk stoIC governor the work of Lewis Carroll Ellis Hillman about Ellis Hillman has been a Governor of\nImperial College since 1973, studied\nGeology and has a maths degree from\nChelsea College. Now he is the\nPrinciple Lecturer in Environmental\nStudies at NELP and is highly\ninterested in \"reverse imagery\nexponential functions\" and anti-matter. To some he will be known for\nhis book \"London Under London\"\n(1985) which describes the world\nbeneath our feet and under the streets,\nin the form of sewers, tunnels, and\ntube ways. The book won the National\nBook League Prize which, ironically,\nwas presented to him by Geoffrey\nArcher on the day after the GLC was\nabolished.\nHe combines these facets of his life\nto power an overwhelming\nenthusiasm for the life and works of\nLewis Carroll, which led to him\nfounding the Lewis Carroll Society in\nMay of 1969.\nLewis Carroll, alias Charles\nLutdwidge Dodgson, was born in\nDaresbury in 1832 and died in\nGuildford in 1898. During his lifetime\nhe succeeded in creating\n'wonderlands', 'dream worlds' and\n'worlds through the looking glass', all\nof which have fascinated children,\nadults mathematicians and logicians\nalike ever since.\nNever a day passes without\nsomeone prominent, or not so\nprominent, quoting from the\nimportant classics \"Alice in\nWonderland\" (1865) or \"Through\nthe Looking Glass and What Alice\nFound There\" (1872).\nNot only did he write though, he\nexplored, studied and commented\nupon many extraordinary changes that\nwere taking place in the real, as well\nas the conceptual world around him.\n\"Alice in Wonderland\" was\noriginally called \"Alice's Adventures\nUnderground\" but he changed this\nwhen he heard about the building of\nthe inner circle line, which was the\nfirst tube train in the world. No doubt\nhe did not want his imaginary world\nso recently created to be so easily\nfound in the real one, its delicate\nsimi lies could so easily have been\nsmothered by a touch of reality.\nHe was a math mat ici an, studying\nhis first year at Cambridge, a logician\nand a clergyman. He developed\ninterests in photography; in particular\nof children of which two original\nplates were found recently, in spirit\nphotography phenomena and\ntheological speculation.\nHis nonsense verses such as\n\"Jabberwocky\", and the longer\n\"Hunting of the Snark\" (1876) have\nnever been equalled. But perhaps not\nall his works were nonsense, the or is es Ellis Hillman. He considers the mad\nhatter to be Charles Babbage, a 'mad\nadder' of the time, who was then\nEcasion Professor at Cambridge. It is\nwritten in his un-published diaries that\nthey met and perhaps he saw his\nadding machine during this time.\nHumpty Dumpty could be George\nHudson, the first person to build a railway. The line 'Humpty Dumpty\nhad a great fall' referring to his\ncompany going bust.\nFinally he thinks that Tweedle Dum\nand Tweedlc r>* represent Prince\nJerome Napoleon a.. J his cousin, the\nmore famous. Napoleon III. The\nPrince often appeared in Queen\nVictoria's court, causing much\namusement as he looked rather\nsimilar.\nThe society, to which Ellis Hillman\nremains Honorary President, has\nsucceeded in esta bii shing a carroll ian presence in Oxford with the Oxford\nAlice Society, in Daresbury. and in\nthe USA with the Lewis Carroll\nSociety of North America. It produces\na number of publications which\ninclude: a quarterly 'Jabberwocky';\na newsletter 'The Bandersnatch':\n'Colson News : Two Way Numbers':\nand 'By The Totum Tree\".\nWith the current interest in Lewis\nCarroll, copies of the famous\nillustrations from the books, drawn by\nSir John Tenniel, sold at Christies for\n\u00a3187,000\u2014it's hardly surprising that\nhe is and will be forever remembered.\nMembership of the Society is open\nto all and inquiries are welcome\nthrough the Chairman and Secretary.\nCatherine and Mark Richards at Flat\n7, Avondale. 109 Truro Road. Wood\nGreen, London. Home number\n01-888-9939.\nbd Ck STROKE Musical purists have been\ncomplaining lately about the quality\nof certain compact discs from various\nsixties garage bands. The digital\nrecordings are considered to be far\ntoo good for the raw style of the\nperformances, which has has led to\nthe development of the new Scratch\nCreator. This device synthesizes and\ninserts random scratches and pressing\nfaults into CD recordings on playback\nto give that vinyl record sound. The\nmachine has three settings\n\"Normal\", \"Mauled\" and \"Record\nLibrary\".\nLanguage researchers over the past\nfew years have noticed how people on\nthe continent have learnt English from\nrecords that they have been listening\nto in the charts. This has caused the\ndevelopment of a brand new type of\nan gu age course\u2014the Linguarock\ncourse. Famous songs are re-record et. with lyrics in the language that the\nstudent wants to learn, to which they\nsit down and listen.\nHowever certain tracks have been\nbanned from the course due to the\ncontent of their lyrics including the\nbulk of Dead Kennedys songs,\nhowever Cliff Richard, Bucks Fizz\nand Engleburt Humperdink have been\npassed fit for consumption. The\ncreators of the system say that they\ndo not want to teach their students any\nbad language, and point out that they\nhave changed many of the existing\nyr ics as most songs say very little on\nsubjects like finding lost umbrellas\nand buying train tickets.\nSocio Holidays is a brand new\ncompany that has set itself up to offer\na whole range of different vacations.\nTo start off their project they have\ntaken over a redundant steelworks in\nCorby, and are offering working\nholidays there making steel tube at the\nprice of \u00a375 a week.\nAsked why they felt such holidays\nwere so in demand, Mike Sale, the\norganiser, replied: \"People have\nbecome very conscious of how they\nspend their leisure time, and that in\nthis computer-controlled age, should\nbe looking for activities that are more\nproductive. These holidays should be\npart icu a rly productive for\nSociologists and Environmental\nPlanners to find out about how they\nfeel they should be living.\"\nOne of those well-known facts about\nstudents is that they smoke marijuana\nwhenever they get the opportunity.\nHowever the truth is far more\nmundane than this; which is why an\nold incense manufacturing firm has\ncome up with the idea of grass\nflavoured joss-sticks. So now< students\ncan impress their friends with 'that\nsmell' without fear of being raided by\nthe boys in blue.\n\n"

Proposed by: John Sattaur\nSeconded by: Sarah Casson.\n1. ICU is affiliated to the World University Service.2. The WUS is an educational charity working for the economic and social justice.3. Over the two years 1979 - 1981, ICU collected over \u00a33,000 for WUS Third\nWorld Scholarship Fund.\n4. Scholarship Fund has provided sufficient funds to assist third world\nrefugees from over twenty different countries. ICU Believes:1. WU5 provides a necessary service in helping third world refugee students\nto gain an education in Britain.2. ICU has shown from past collections that it has the ability to raise funds\nwhich are of use to furthering the work of WUS.\nICU Instructs: That the collection at registration during Fresher s' Week be reinstated on a regular basis, and the money raised be donated to the central World\nUniversity Scholarship Fund.\nMOTION ON I.L.E.A. Proposed by: Peter Burt\nSeconded by: Simon Neil d. IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nProposal for extension of Sports Hall feasibility study\nto include new Junior Common Room\nRecent surveys have shown that many potential students reject offers from Imperial\nCollege because of the 'poor social atmosphere' and lack of good social events. Students\nat a college the size of Imperial can usually expect social activities of a scale which\nthe Students' Union is currently unable to provide. The Union is restricted as follows:\n1) The current Junior Common Room is the only room available to the Union for\nsocial events for more than 250 people. It is, however, not purpose-built and is considered by many organisers to be unsuitable in some respects. Furthermore the\nprofits from the JCR bar, which are essential to make such events financially viable, do not return to IC Union but go into the college refectory account.\n2) The Union Building is not suitable for such activities because the rooms are too\nsmall and complaints from local residents limit 'noisy' events to two or three\ntimes a year, at the most.\nWe believe that if IC Union is to provide entertainments and social activities up\nto the standard provided in comparable institutions, we need a room under Union control,\ncapable of holding over 400 students, on the College site where noise is not a problem.\nAny bar or catering outlets in this room should be controlled by the Union so that the\nprofits can be used to sub sid is e regular, affordable social events.\nIf the Union were to gain control of the bar in the Junior Common Room, the JCR\ncould serve this purpose a de gu at ely. However we feel that the proposals for a new indoor\nsports hall at the South Kensington site could ultimately offer the ideal solution for\nboth College and the Union. A Union-controlled Junior Common Room incorporated in the\nnew sports hall building would not only satisfy the Union's need for space but would\nrelease more areas in the Sherfield building for further refectory expansion, should\nthis prove necessary. Demands for space from all sectors of the college become ever\nmore critical bearing in mind the projected increase in student numbers and also the\nproposed merge with St. Mary's Hospital Medical School.\n1. Government proposals to cut the budget of the Inner London Education\nAuthority by \u00a3120min the coming year, and plans to remove the right of\nLonders to directly elect representatives to the Authority.2. The National Dey of Action on 24th January in support of the ILEA.\nICU Believes:1. Adequate state funding is essential if educational standards are to be\nmaintained and if there is to be open access to education.2. Cuts in the rate support grant and new \" rate capping\" proposals will lead to a serious under funding of LEA's which will in turn lead to a decreased\nquality of education.3. The higher costs and particular social conditions found in inner London\nmean that education here will be more e pensive than otherwise.4. Cuts in discretionary awards to ILEA students and under funding of the 36\nPolytechnics, Further Education and specialist Colleges assisted by the\nILEA would result from Government expenditure proposals. Higher education\nas a service to the whole of London will therefore be wrecked.\n5. The proposals outlined above would mean that it is Central Government\nthat decides upon the level of educational provision for in nner London.\nAbolition of the ILEA and its parent body, the GLC, is a flagrant erosion of local democracy in the face of all party opposition. ICU Condems:\n1. Direct political interference with education.2. Plans to reorganise the ILEA and abolish the GLC,\nThat the feasibility study be extended to take account of a further floor in the sports\nhall building to accomodate a Junior Common Room, as detailed above.\nICU Supports:\n1. The \"Save the ILEA\" campaign,\nICU Instructs:1. That the President writes to Mr. Patrick Jenkin, Secretary of State for the\nEnvironment, Sir Keith Joseph, Secretay of State for Education, Mr. Peter\nBrooke, Local MP, and the local press stressing full support for the ILEA.\n2. That the above motion be proposed on behalf of Imperial College Union at\nthe ULU General Union Council. CHRI5TINE TAIG\nPresident\nImperial College Union 5th February 1987 MOTION ON CRUISE MI5SILE5.\nProposed by: C.T. Williams. Seconded by: C. Crownshaw.\nCruise missiles are presently arriving in this country.\nICU Instructs:1. The President of ICU to write to the President of the USA requesting a cruise missile be named Imperial College Students Union.\n2. That the motion be taken to U.L. U. "

    "content": "Sabbaticals FELIX, Friday February 13th19878 or a Dep Rep\nWho wants to be Hon Sec?\nIn the second of our\nsabbatical profiles, Dave\nColley writes about being\nICU dogs body. I arrive at the office between 9.45 to\n10.00am; on arrival it is time to settle\ndown to write some minutes until the\nmail is delivered.\nThe mail that usually arrives for me\nis insurance details, bills for\ntransport, or any 'loon ie' mail that\nmight have been addressed to the\nUnion. Having filed this the first of\nthe enquiries about whether or not the\nUnion has any parking permits left,\nbecause some Porche driver finds\nthey have to walk to College from\nQueensgate, arrives. This spot on the\nMonday morning is usually taken up\nby people telling me how rough the\nvans are sounding or that the reason\nthe exhaust pipe fell of the van was\nnothing to do with them. Sometimes\nthere is that worrying phone call from\nYorkshire telling me that the van isn't starting and the A A are on their way.\nAfter sorting out the cash and\ncomplaints along with an heroic saint\ncalled Kathy, in walks the first of a new intake asking for a Union card\nalthough there are enough signs\nscattered around the Union Office\nsaying that the cards will be done only\non Tuesday between 2.00 and 4.00pm( it still a noyes me that some people\nwalk in with a registry slip from\nOctober 31st1986, why couldn't they\nget their cards at the allot ed time?)\nThen the time is upon me to sort\nout the outside hire vans for the\nweekend. This could be quite cut and\ndried, however, it is a pain the arse\nwhen someone comes in on Thursday\nafternoon and cancels them or wants\nto order a van. This is followed by\na call to Bristol to ask the motor\ninsurers to add the vans temporarily\nto our policy.\nI then settle down to a bit more\nminute taking and in walks the first\nperson of the day to ask for an\ninsurance form and aks what is\nneeded to speed forth their claim.\nThe \"rush hour\" between 12.30\nand 4.00pm is the next thing on the\nagenda and the office explodes with\npeople checking mail, making phone\ncalls, booking vans and rooms and\nasking questions or favours. During\nthese hours I try to take some of the\npressure off Kathy and help out all the\npeople I can.\nIn between this, the job that can be\ndone is the geste t ne ring. This ranges\nfrom geste t ne ring minutes to\ngeste t ne ring posters and fly leaflets and involves the operator being\ncovered in large globules of ink. (For\nthose of you who wonder at and take\nthe piss out of my dungarees, there\nis a sound reason for wearing them.)\nThe other part of my duplicating\nempire is the photocopier which has\nbeen serviced. But most of my\ndinner time question and answer\nsession is spent trying to piece back\ntogether a broken photocopier\nbecause people can't find the paper\ntray and dismantle the whole thing.\nAt about this time I see that we're\nrunning low on Xerox paper and\nNorman has requested bin bags and\naprons and Kevin wants a safety boot\ncatalogue or a diary. So I don my coat\nand hat and grab my all terrain, four\nwheeled transport vehicle and head\ndown to the stores to pick up the\nitems. Yet again they don't have a safety boot catalogue, so Kevin won't be pleased and the bin bags are on\norder so we will have to 'borrow'\nsome from somewhere.\nAt about 4 o 'clock at the beginning\nof both the Christmas and Easter\nterms I trek off to one of the\nAmerican Colleges that are affiliated\nto us to tell them what we have to\noffer them and take posters\nadvertising events, then it's back in\ntime for Council or some other\ncommittee and to take minutes.\nMinutes: This has a special\nparagraph all of its own as this is\npossibly the most boring thing that\nIs there anyone out there studying\nPhysics. Maths or Computing, who\nfancies a week in Sweden, May 9th? The Royal Institute of Technology\nin Stockholm is inviting students from\n30 universities around the world for\na \"friendly week of exchanging\nideas.\" From what I can gather the\nprogramme is about 50% industrial\nvisits and presentations and 50%\nanyone on a committee can make\nanybody else do. It's alright if you\nonly have to do it for one committee,\nbut for eight it's getting a bit steep.\nThe writing of minutes involves\nwriting a rough copy at the meeting\nthen writing it out neatly for Pat to\ntype, and then reading them again,\nthen producing enough copies for\nCouncil, for the next meeting of the\ncommittee, then I glue a copy in the\nminute book. All this is done so that\npeople in the future can read what\nwe've done and people of the present\ncan make paper darts to attack us\nwith.\nAfter everyone has gone home the\nHon Sec comes alive and up go\nelection papers and new notice board\nallocations and the printing of election\nrules can take place relatively\nundisturbed. Also at this moment a real attempt is made to s uss out the\njobs for tomorrow and then it's down\nto Norm's or the bar for some food\nand a swift pint and to listen to some\npiss head in the bar (probably me a few years back) saying \"bloody\ntypical, boozing again, you only took\non this job for a year off or \"don't you ever work.\"\nThe answer is yes, we do work hard\nand to any budding Hon Sec out there\nplease don't think this job is a year\noff, because it isn't, it's probably one\nof the hardest jobs to do because\nyou've got to deal with people over\npoints and views which a year ago\nyou agreed with, and because no-one\nunderstands a job until they do it,\nyou've got a different view now.\nDave Colley.\nhaving a good time in Stockholm (a brilliant city!)\u2014wild parties etc. etc.\nThe good bit is that the Swedes will\npay for board and lodging and\nentertainment\u2014looks like a pretty\ngood week to me (pity I can't spare\nthe time.)\nIf anyone's interested, come and\nsee me for details, before February\n24th. Christine\nNow is the time when people start to\nthink about becoming their\ndepartment's representative for the\nnext academic year. Being a \"Dep\nRep\" is a good way to get involved\nin student matters\u2014and to achieve\nresults that really benefit the people\nin your department. Before standing\nfor the post (election papers will be\ngoing up in all departments\u2014except\nManagement Science and Social and\nEconomic Studies\u2014within a couple of\nweeks) you should find out just what\nit involves. The best way is of course,\nto talk to your current Dep Rep, but\nhere's a brief guide.\nThe Dep Rep is elected by all the\nstudents in the department by secret\nballot, to look after their academic\nand social welfare and represent their\ninterests.\nDep Rep duties include: organising\nthe staff-student committee, providing\ngeneral communication between staff\nand students, and following up\nacademic complaints and problems;\norganising the department's social\nlite\u2014fresher s dinners, parties,\ncommon room facilities, etc; running\nelections for academic and social reps\nin each year\u2014and working with them;\nhelping to organise open days and\nadmissions days; writing about your\ndepartment for the alternative\nprospectus; representing the students\nin Union affairs and channelling\ninformation between the Unions (both\nCCU and ICU) and your department.\nAs well as the staff-student\ncommittee, the Dep Reps sit on the\nAcademic Affairs Committee of their\nCCU and IC Union; they take part in\nthe CCU General Committee and IC\nUnion Council. In some departments\nthey are also directly involved in the\ndepartmental society and safety\ncommittees.\nThis may sound like a lot of time\nin meetings but all are important.\nAcademic Affairs Committees give\nyou the opportunity to get help and\nadvice from other Dep Reps and to\nswap tactics and ideas. Your position\non the CCU General Committee and\nIC Union Council ensures that the\n\"ordinary students\" in your\ndepartment are represented on wider\nissues which directly affect them. In\norder to be able to tell their students\njust what is going on, Dep Reps\nshould also try to attend Union\nGeneral Meetings.\nAnyone standing for a Dep Rep\npost should realise that it doesn't just\nmean working on academic problems.\nA large time con irn it ment is necessary\nto do the job properly; you also need\nto be willing to take an active interest\nin what's going on around College\nand in your Unions and to spread the\nword around your department. The\njob probably isn't as daunting as it\nsounds\u2014and one success can make it\nall worthwhile.\nChristine Taig\nChristine was too busy to write enough copy to fill the space. "

    "content": "Feature FELIX, Friday February 13th19877 highlighted by the Swiss chemical\nfirm disaster, where 30 tonnes of\nherbicide escaped from the Sandoz\nfactory in to the Rhine. The death of\n500,000 fish is just one result of this\ncarelessness\u2014full recovery of the\nriver ecosystem will take at least 10\nyears. This incident is another\nexample of the economic damage\ncreated by pollution. The eel trade\nbased on the Rhine was almost\nobliterated, due to the deaths of the\nfish.\nOne of the arguments most\nfrequently used against the\nintroduction of pollution control\nmeasures is the cost of such\ntechnologies. Although this may well\nbe the case at present, there are three\ngeneral reasons to believe that this\nwill not always be true. Firstly, as the\nsupply of a good increases this\ngenerally induces the fall in prices;\nthe more research and development\nput in the more likely we are to find\ncheaper and cheaper ways to produce\ndevices to reduce emission of\npollutants. Secondly, we must weigh\nup long term costs against short term\ncosts; in Britain it is estimated that it\nwill cost \u00a3200 million to clean our\nwaterways of nitrogen pollutants-how much cheaper would it have been\nto prevent their initial leaking into our\nSome of these technologies are\nalready in action: the FGDs, which\nreduce emission of sulphur dioxide\nfrom coal-fired power stations have\nbeen fitted to many stations\nthroughout Europe. Lead has been\nremoved from petrol in Germany and\nHolland, while in the US the fitting\nof catalytic converters to exhaust\npipes on new cars has reduced\nemissions of CO2 and hydrocarbons\nby 90%, and of nitrogen oxides by\n75%, between 1970 and 1984.\nThe second stalling point of the\nestablishment is over the lack of proof\nof harmful effects of pollutants. For\nevery expert who will say\nradioactivity is harmful there is\nanother who will say there is no\nevidence of harm. It has taken a long\ntime for people to accept that Acid\nrain is causing damage to\nScandinavian and German fir trees.\nAs scientists we have a role to play\nin research on the effects of pollution\nbut more important is the activity of\ngenerating solutions to the problems\nof environmental contamination.\nIt is European Year of the\nEnvironment this year\u2014one of its\nstrongest messages should be to make\npollution control a series of\npreventative policies and not, as it has\nbeen, a case of shutting the stable\n\"Dead fish in the Rhine and radioactive sheep\"\nwaterways. Thirdly, social costs must\nbe taken into account; economic\ndevelopment is not an end in itself but\na means to achieve an improvement\nin the quality of life\u2014part of this\nquality is the quality of our\nenvironment. Furthermore these\ntechnologies could have a significant\neffect on reducing the social cost of\nunemployment: eg the fitting of Fluid\nGas Desulphurizers (FGDs) to power\nstations may generate up to 3000jobs each.\ndoor after the horse has bolted. It is\nimportant that the economic\nadvantages of pollution control should\nbe stressed.\nAs a contribution to the European\nYear of the Er ' -ment, Imperial\nCollege is staging an environmental\nWeek from March 2nd6 th; there will\nbe displays and talks by various\ngroups with interests in the\nenvironment, as well as films and\nstalls around the Collge.\nGUTTER PRESS It is now that time of year when\nprospective sabbatical candidates start\nto collar gossip column writers and\nbore them stupid about various\n\"em baras sing\" incidents they claim\nto have endured. These incidents are\ngenerally either anatomically\nimpossible, suicidal or just plain\ntedious. However they all have one\nthing in common, they are all totally\nfictitious.\nThis week we can guarantee that all\nthe stories concerning this rare breed\ndo not originate from any h were near\nthe respective horses' mouths. The\nfirst story concerns a certain Union\nPublicity Officer who was bemused\nat not receiving any money from the\ntax office recently. The main reason\nfor this common occur en ce was his\nstrange method of posting his forms.\nRather than put them in an envelope\nand into a post-box like any other sane\nhuman being, he goes for the\nalternative method of putting them\ninto Christine Taig's desk and\nforgetting about it. Now, had he put\na stamp on it...\nIt seems that Stephanie Snell is so\ngrateful for toy-boy Mark \"I only\nsleep on her floor\" Ball, that she\nproceeded to thank all the people that\nbrought her and Mark together\nthrough the channels of IC Radio.\nDave Tyler and Dave Williams got\nspecial name checks as the people who\nbrought romance into her life by\nconsistently winding them up about\ntheir supposed love-life.\nResident brick Man Tai Tseung\nseems never to get the hint. After\nbooking two parties in the JCR for\nthis term he happily went away for\nregular dinners with Anne Diamond.\nIn between these excursions he would\ngo up to the Union Office where there\nis a big sign explaining that there\ncannot be any parties in the JCR\nbecause of the re decoration work; and\nall around him people were talking\nabout the work while painting their\nboycott posters. But he cheerfully\nwent on arranging things and\ndreaming of Lobster Thermidor with\nAnne Diamond. Until the fateful day\nwhen he tried to get some posters\ndesigned for the events, and someone\nkindly reminded him about the\nbuilding work. Duly panicked he\nfinally went off and checked, to find\nout that he had to use the Main Dining\nHall instead\u2014a room known politely\nas \"the aircraft hangar.\" No doubt\nwhen the four-minute warning comes\nhe will be booking another dinner.\nSarah Kirk, excitable denizen of the\nBiochemistry department and general\nmenace to occupants of the Snack\nBar, has shown that she is to subtlety\nwhat Genghis Khan was to socialism.\nLate for morning lecture she dashed\ninto a lift in Sherfield to be faced with\nnone other than John Smith, College\nSecretary. Unable to cope with this\ndegree of authority she instantly leapt\nback out of the lift with a shriek.\nThinking that the lift had gone she\nturned to her friend and explained;\n\"Urgh, I'm not getting into a lift with\nJohn Smith.\" At this point she turned\naround again to find that the lift, and\nof course John Smith, were still there\nand listening to every word.\nOnce again it is that time to relay\nanother Joe 90 story. Our Joe is\ncurrently heading for mega-stardom\nwith stories stranger than those found\nin Dallas. No instant plastic surgery\nfor Joe, just a tale of alarm clocks.\nOne day, after another sojourn in\nthe Southside hostelry, Joe realised\nthat it was the day before the Guilds\ntrip to Brighton and that he must not\nmiss it on any account. So he decided\nthat the thing to do was to get an\nalarm clock. Simple enough really, it\nwas just that he wanted it at 12\nmidnight.\nThe first thing to do was to ask\nsome random passerby in the street\nwhether they had one. The poor\nunfortunate victim of this question\nwas an American woman who denied\nthat she carried alarm clocks around\nwith her quite vehemently.\nRemember that our Joe was more than\ntwo sheets to the wind at this point\nin the story.\nUnsuccessful with this ploy he\ndecided to go home on the tube back\nto Hammersmith. After asking\nseveral passengers he managed to\nalight at the correct station and made\nhis way back to his flat. However he\nstill did not have anything even\nresembling an alarm clock.\nUndaunted by this fact, and intellect\nun blunted by his alcohol-induced\ncondition he came to the conclusion\nthat the people in the flat downstairs\nmust have one. His solution was to\nknock on the door, go straight in and\ntake a random alarm clock while the\noccupants were still recoiling from the\nlight, with the immortal words:\n\"Seeing as I 've just woken you up,\nyou won't be getting up early\ntomorrow, will you?\"\n\n"
