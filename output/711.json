    "content": "4 *\ndl From DaWd J Green\nChairman, Industrial Society\nDear Sir,\nI read with interest and\ndisappointment your article\nand editorial concerning\nIndustrial Society in the last\nissue of FELIX (No 710). I. would like to clarify a number of points and\ncorrect a few inaccuracies.\n1. Indsoc does not hold two\nbank accounts in its\nname\u2014it has one external\naccount consisting of a current and a deposit\naccount.\n2. That account is used to\nmanage money generated\nby our annual Careers Fair.\nNo Union money has ever\nbeen paid into the account.\n3. Dave Parry's letter was\ndated 10th June 1985, and\nwas not received by myself\nuntil 12th June, 5 days\nbefore our summer tour. It\nwas the first formal\ncommunication made to\nmyself or any of my\npredecessors.\n4. The letter was, in fact,\ndiscussed at out committee\nmeeting of the year on\nFriday 14th June.\n5. On Sunday 16th June,\nmore than half the\n\u00a353\n\u2022 David J Green: 'Interest and\ndisappointment'\ncommittee were on Summer\nTour in Eire\u2014a fact which\nthe old exec knew.\n6. Contact was attempted\nwith Nigel Graham after\nreturning from Eire, but as\nhe was on holiday, no\ncontact could be arranged.\n7. Dave Parry was informed\nof the situation and we were\nassured that the new exec\nwould be told as well.\n8. Previously, during the\nsummer term, at least two\nother meetings were\narranged with Nigel Graham\nand/or the S CC Chairman,\nShamin Pirzada to begin\ndiscussing the problem. On\neach occasion, Indsoc was\nPG Tips\nIf the postgraduate group is\nto be functional and PGs\nare to be represented\nproperly on both IC Union\nand College Committees\nthen it is important that a new Postgraduate Academic\nAffairs Committee be\nelected before the start of\nthe next session. To this\nend there will be a General\nMeeting of the PG Group on\nthe 31st of July, at 6.00pm in the Holland Club, to elect\na new committee. The\nfollowing posts are up for\ngrabs, and here is a brief\nresume of their\nresponsibilities.\nPGAAO:-To co-ordinate\nthe running of the group. To\nsit on Graduate Studies and\nBoard of Studies, both\ncollege committees, and IC\nCouncil and Academic\nrepresented only to find that\nthose we were meant to be\n\u2022Editorial note:\nUnfortunately we have been\nforced to cut this epic due\nto lack of space. Part 2 will\nfollow in the next issue.\nAnyone desperate to read\nthe rest of this letter should\ndrop into the FELIX office\nand pick up a copy of the\nentire letter.\nit Edit ori a New Boat.\nImperial College has, at\npresent, a projected deficit\nnext year of four thousand\npounds. This means that,\nunless the Union managed\nto under spend last year,\nclubs will have to take\nfurther cuts. Ian Bull's decision to give boat club a new eight makes this more\nlikely. Carl Burgess has the\nopportunity still to reverse\nthe decision and that is\nwhat he must do. Boat Club\nis one of IC Union's most\nsuccessful and prestigious\nclubs. Year after year it has\nwon. However it is arguable\nwhether they need a new\neight to compete at this\nlevel. Many top rowers claim\nthat the boat club has\nsuccessfully conned UFC\nWith many other clubs\nfacing severe problems as\nthe result of the cuts they\nhave been forced to take, it\nis amazing that Boat Club\nare given such a luxury.\nThe decision itself was\nnot quite as bad, though, as\nthe way it was taken. UFC\nhad made it quite clear that\nthey regarded a new eight\nas a luxury. UFC is one of\nthe most representative\ncommittees of IC Union. It\nis made up of people with\nwide experience of College.\nThey decided that a new\neight was low priority and\nthere should have been no\nfurther discussion. Instead\nIan Bull, a former ACC chairman, was persuaded\ninto making an executive\ndecision. Others have\ndescribed it as lan's parting\ngift to ACC while I wouldn't be so cynical. It would seem\nthat Ian has a very bad\nmemory. That is the only\nway I can explain the way\nhe seems to have forgotten\nthe debate at UFC and\nforgotten to consult the\nmembers of UFC still at\ncollege.\nFortunately, Carl can, and\nmust, reverse the decision.\nThe problem of the boat\nclub should then be brought\nto the first UFC of term. A decision on how six\nthousand pounds should be\nspent cannot be left to\nsabbaticals alone.\nCarl In Linstead.\nDr. Richard Clarke is\ncriticised by many residents\nof Linstead for trying to turn\nthe Hall into a sort of public\nschool dormitory. He is\naccused of going on patrol\nat eleven o' clock at night to\nmake sure that there is\nabsolutely no noise. While\ndiscipline is essential in any\nhall, Halls should be lively\nAffairs Committee, which\nare student committees.\nTo give advice and help\non any problems that may\narise between students and\nsupervisors. To advise the\nother officers of the student\nunion on any matters\nrelating to PG's. Treasurer:-To handle the\nGroups funds.\nSecre.far y: To print tickets,\nposters etc. for social events\nand keep minutes of any\nmeetings held (not a very\ndifficult job this one!).\nUG Liason Officer:-A post\nfor a Third/Fourth year\nthinking of going onto\nPostgraduate Studies.\nTwo ordinary members:-To organise social events\nand do anything else that is\nneeded.\nIf anybody is interested in\nany of these and would like\nfurther information I can be\ncontacted via the IC Union .\nOffice.\nOne word of warning, if a committee is not elected by\nthe start of the new year\nthen the PG Group won't run and I shall have no\nhe s it atai on in handing back\nthe money allocated to us\nfor the next year so it can\nbe given to people who are\nactually interested enough\nto put it to good use.\nChris Hendy PG AAO 84/85\n\u2022Ian Bull: 'A very bad\nmemory'\nplaces where first year\nstudents are encouraged to\ntake part in the social life.\nDr Clarke's latest decision\nseems to be part of his\npolicy aimed at killing hall\nsocial life. Carl has\nun doubt ably left his room\non occasion in a revolting\nstate. However, he is IC\nUnion President. He was\nelected democratically. He\nrepresents IC students.\nLinstead benefits from\nhaving the President as a resident. Invariably the\nPresident does contribute to\nthe hall social life. Dr Clarke\nhimself has been quoted as\nsaying that one of the\nreasons that Linstead is the\nbest hall is that the\nPresident is in residence.\nCarl needs to be on\ncampus, so Dr Clarke\nshould back down.\nCredits:\nThis FELIX would have had\n'no chance' without Judith\nHackney, Nobber Burgess,\nOligo, Chris Hendy, Nigel\nAtkinson, Chris Martin,\nRosemary Ivor-Jones and\nTony Churchill.\nFelix is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College\nUnion Publications Board and is printed by the Union Print Unit,\nImperial College, Prince Consort Road, London SW7: Telephone 01-589\n5111 Ext 3515: Editor Hugh Southey: Business Manager: J Martin Taylor:\nCopyright FELIX 1985.

A State Of Affairs\nby Graham Swannell,\n\u00a7j at the Duchess Theatre.\nOh dear, bored again, I'm1 afraid. Its not that I couldn't understand Graham\nSwannell's new play, it's just\nthat it is aimed at all those\nyoung aspiring people who\n:. are married with kids and an\naffair to support. And quite\nfrankly, I'm not.\nApart from appealing to an\n::: elite audience, much of the\nplay's ambiguity lies in the\nfabric of the text. Black\nhumour is a delicate vehicle\nand unfortunately Swannell\nneatly separates drama from\nhumour in all the sketches,\nleaving the audience at best\nbemused, often bewildered.\nMoreover the plays are\nremarkably chau veni st. Women's views are lightly\ndefused behind stock clich es; here married man holds the\nreins and always comes out\non top. A bitter irony, with no\nsolutions attached, this 'stab\nat marriage' is far more a case\nof wife-battering.\nCassandra\nby Christa Wolf\nThis imaginative and tense\naccount of the fall of Troy,\nwritten by a woman described\nby the Guardian as 'an East\nGerman Virginia Woolf has\nmany disturbing and thought-provoking messages buried in\nthe narrative.\nThe story is told by the\nprophetess Cassandra,\ndaughter of King Priam, and\nas it unfolds the multiple\nabsurdities of the war strike\nus as they can only strike an\nonlooker in any conflict. The\npresence or absence of Helen\nmakes little difference to the\nwar. Although it is over her\nthat the war is purportedly\nstarted, it is continued of a mixture of folly, conceit,\nhabit, ambition and blood\nlust, until the unhappy\nconclusion when the\ninhabitants of Troy are\noverwhelmed and the Greeks\ntake a bloody revenge of\nmurder, rape, looting and\nkidnapping for their dead\nsoldiers buried by the City\nwalls.\nAnyone who imagines.the\nAncient Greeks to have been\na cultured, honourable people\nHas your computer just\nbeen sick all over your\nprintout?

In each issue over\nthe summer (sic), we'll be\npresenting various type of\nwriting for you to try your\nhand at. We start with\nprobably the simplest type,\nthe rhyming poems,\nexamples of which can be\nseen in most 'Greetings\nCards'. Although the subject\nmatter of the following\npoem is pretty serious\n(unrequited love), note the\nalmost 'happy' rhythm n. 'Shadows'\nShadows of the dark are\nrare,\nMore get get seen in\ndaylights glare,\nA gift I give, the whole day\nthrough,\nI give my Shadow to you...\nTo laugh, to cry,\nTo have, to share,\nMy Shadow will e 'er be\nthere,\nWith hurt and pain\nAnd joys to share,\nMy Shadow will still be\nthere,\nThrough laugh and sorrow,\nSecrets to know,\nMy Shadow will never go,\nI have one wish, a hope, a plea,\nWhen will you give your\nShadow to me?\nWhen you find a 'beat'\nyou're happy with, try to\nvary it, slightly at first. The\ninversion in the next poem\ndestroys the flow, but I think\nit emphasises its circular\nnature.\nThe towers-that we build so\nhigh,\nYou pushed me, falling,\nscreaming, Why?\nThrough short free-fall I didn't care\nfor life again, without you\nthere,\nWho picked me up I yet not\nknow.\nFriend or foe,\nKnow not yet\nJoke or bet.\nBut hand-in-hand we climb\nthat stair,\nEach step taken with greater\ncare.\nMaybe this time we'll find\nout why,\nThe towers that we build so\nhigh.\nNow it's your turn!

The\nsabbaticals reversed the\nUFC decision when it was\nrevealed that Athletics\nClubs Committee had\nunder spent by a significant amount.\nAt an emergency UFC, in\nearly June, boat club claimed\nthey needed a new eight every\ntwo years because eights lost\ntwo lengths every year. The\nmeeting decided, though, that\nas the estimates for equipment\nexpenditure were about six\nthousand pounds over budget\nthe plans to buy a new eight\nhad to be scrapped. It was\nalso revealed at the same\nmeeting that the estimates for\nrecurrent expenditure were\nabout four thousand pounds\nover budget. The sabbaticals\nargued that this might be\ncovered by the money\nallocated for this year that\nhadn't been spent. At the\nsame meeting STOIC'S application for a thousand\npounds for a new studio were\nturned down.\nThe executive are only\nempowered to make urgent\ndecisions and decisions on\nmatter of discipline. Several\nsenior Union Officers are said\nto be concerned that this\ndecision was not left until the\nfirst UFC of term. They claim\nthis would have given boat\nclub enough time to buy the\nnew eight and train for the\nmajor regattas in it. Other\nofficers say that the boat isn't needed at all. They quote\nOlympic standard rowers who\nsay that boats don't lose two\nlengths a year.\nUnion President, Carl\nBurgess said that the decision\nhad been made by the\noutgoing sabbaticals. He\nadded that he supported the\ndecision.\nPresident\nBanned\n\u2022Carl Burgess: 'Wrecking his room.'\nCarl Burgess, ICU\nPresident, has been\nbanned from living in\nRoom 434, Linstead Hall,\nthe room that is\ntraditionally occupied by\nIC Union Presidents. The\ndecision was taken after\nDr Richard Clarke,\nWarden of Linstead Hall,\nobjected to having Mr\nBurgess in his hall\nbecause of his reputation\nfor wrecking his room.\nAt a meeting of hall wardens\nto discuss where Union\nofficers would be housed, Dr\n'Clarke complained that the\nroom Mr Burgess had\noccupied in Southside this\nyear was in such a state that\nthe cleaners had refused to go\nin it. He went on to say that he\nwasn't prepared to have\nsomeone with that sort of\nrecord living in his hall.\nMr Burgess claims that he\nhas been picked upon. He\nsays that he has been unable\nto discuss the problem with Dr\nClarke because the complaint\nwas made while he was in the\nmiddle of his examinations. Mr\nBurgess claims that he is not\nbothered by the decision. He\nbelieves he will have more\nfreedom to criticise College\nresidence policy if he isn't resident in an IC hall.\nMr Burgess moved out of\nFalmouth-Keogh hall at\nEaster. When he left the\ncleaners insisted that they\nwere given full sets of\nprotective clothing including\nface masks. Mr Burgess claims\nthis was an over reaction. He\nsays that in his view the room\nwas in quite good condition\nconsidering the cleaners had\nrefused to touch it for six\nmonths.\nNormally sabbaticals have\ntheir hall bills payed by the\nUnion. In this case Mr Burgess\nis being payed the money\ndirectly. Mr Burgess is at\npresent living at home while\nhe looks for a flat.\nMary Attenborough, ICU\nPresident 1978/79, was the last\nPresident not to live in College\nhalls, or houses.\nHenley\nHi-Jinks\nThis week has been\nparticularly trying in the\nFELIX office. Not only was\nthe typesetter playing up but\nwe were be sei ged by hordes\nof students trying vainly to\nget into the Union Office.\nThe FELIX staff were forced\nto stop thier toil to patiently\nexplain that all the\nsabbaticals and Union Staff\nhad gone on a picnic.\nIt bodes well for next year\nthat the organisation of this\n'outing' has taken the office\nover two weeks. After\nseveral false starts, the final\ndate was set with a suggestion, believed to have\nbeen by Jen Hardy-Smith,\nthat everyone should go to\nthe races. After discovering\nthat the nearest races were\nin Folkestone, a relaxing day\nat Henley was decided\nupon. Union Receptionist\nKathy Tait was overheard in\nthe Union Bar, saying that\nshe'd been to purchase over\n\u00a350 of food for the junket on\nthe Union's behalf.\nFree!
