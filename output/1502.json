    "content": "Whilst trawling through the latest collection in\nTopshop one rarely stops to consider the environmental impact of the fashion industry, but with the\nincreasing trend of disposable fashion it\u2019s quickly\nbecoming more of an issue than ever. From the\npesticides used during the farming of cotton and\nthe large quantity of water needed in the dying process to the carbon footprint of the transportation,\nevery step of the product line causes harm to the\nenvironment. Landfill sites are also feeling the\nstrain as people throw away bags full of unwanted\npieces.\nOf course there has always been some degree\nof harm to the environment, but modern day practices are worsening the problem. Only a couple of\ndecades ago, the majority of clothes bought in England had actually been made in England from start\nto finish, but now we see even home favourites like\nMarks and Spencer outsourcing to less developed\ncountries. Whilst this obviously brings up the issue\nof sweatshops and poor working conditions, the increased amount of air transportation has also had\na significant impact on carbon pollution.\nThe introduction of shops like Primark and H&M\nhave exacerbated the problem with their constantly\nevolving collections and cheap prices. Where, in\npast years, a girl might buy one new dress a month,\nshe can now afford to buy five to keep\non top of all of the latest trends.\nRather than buying key investment\npieces that, whilst costing more,\nare a better quality and will be\nworn for years to come, people\nare opting for quantity. The fast\npaced nature of the fashion industry means that what\u2019s \u2018in\u2019 is\nalways changing, and shops like\nPrimark mean that everyone can\nkeep up.\nBut things need to change. Some shops have\nstarted to introduce eco-friendly designs, specifically made from raw organic materials, or sometimes even from recycling old clothes, but more can\nbe done to lessen the problem. With vintage designs becoming increasingly popular, it has never\nbeen more in vogue to recycle unwanted clothes,\nand through charity shops, vintage stores and auction sites like eBay, it has never been easier.\nAnother craze sweeping the nation is clothes\nswapping parties. This is where a large group of\n(normally) women get together, bringing any unwanted clothes with the intention to swap them for\nsomething someone else has brought. Not only\nare they great for the environment, they\u2019re really\nsociable events and are ideal for the current financial climate.\nFor Green Week (Monday 21 November \u2013 Friday\n25 November), Imperial\u2019s Women in SET are hosting a college wide clothes swap. So if you have\nany clothes you don\u2019t wear anymore, that don\u2019t\nfit, or that you\u2019re simply bored of, then this is the\nperfect opportunity to get rid of them and swap\nthem for new ones. Every day during the start of\nGreen Week you can drop your clothes off in the\nfoyer Sherfield for Tokens, and on Tuesday evening\nin FiveSixEight (one of the union bars). The swap\nwill happen on Wednesday (the 23rd) all day in the\nUnion Meeting Room 7, where you come along and\nexchange your tokens for clothes. This is for both\nboys and girls so everyone can get involved!\nLaura Johnston\nGREEN WEEK\nFELIX\n22 Friday 18 november 2011\nThe Environmental\nImpact of Fashion\nHey, remember that awful band 5ive? I\u2019ve got a\nfriend in Bristol who loves them. Anyway, they\nalso did that horrible song \u2018When the Lights Go\nOut\u2019, something I\u2019m glad I can\u2019t really recall. They\ndid however hit a good point \u2013 that turning off unnecessary lights is pretty ace. This is what Student\nSwitch Off is all about.\nI should stress that choosing that song was not\nmychoice,butenergysavingaspirationswillhope-fully redeem me. The Student Switch Off is a campaign in halls of residence to save energy (queue\npun about how you should \u2018get down\u2019with energy-savvy actions).\nHere\u2019s the deal, the hall that saves the most energy at the end of the year will get a massive party\nfunded by Imperial. Last year Eastside dominated\nthe energy saving boards, so\ncongrats to them.\nTo make things even more\nfun, there will be towers of\nprizes throughout the year for energy-saving ac-tions. Roughly every two weeks Ben & Jerry\u2019s\nice cream, club tickets, NUS extra cards and more\nthings than you can paint in a day. To hit it off,\nlike the Facebook page \u2018Imperial College Student\nSwitch Off\u2019 and while you\u2019re at it, slam yourself\nonto the mailing list so you know when you can\nwin prizes like mad.\nThe idea behind this is that lots of little actions\ncollectively make big differences. So you don\u2019t\nhave to stop using technology or revert to a cave\nman diet. Switching things off when not in use,\nusing a lid when cooking, filling the kettle to just\nthe amount you need and using clothing in place\nof heating is all we ask for. For\nadded fun, you can check out\nthe geeky videos on the website\nThese tiny actions, last year energy consumption\ninhallsreducedby3%comparedtopreviousyears.\nThis prevented 26 tonnes of CO2\nfrom entering the\natmosphere in just 4 months and is equivalent to\ntheenergyneededtoeitherpoweranenergysaving\nlight bulb for 373 years, make 1,500,000 cups of\ntea, or fly from London to Manchester 588 times!\nFor more information and to \u2018show you what\nit\u2019s all about\u2019 please visit the website www.stu-dentswitchoff.org.\nYou don\u2019t have to be a 90s pop enthusiast to\ntake part, but it would be great if you could turn\nthe lights off (and all the rest of it) when you\u2019re\ngoing out!\nStefan Piatek\nStudents turned on by switching off\nWhy the hell would someone want to become a\nvegetarian \u2013 this is probably the general consensus\nfor most of the UK population, am I right?You are\ndestined to a world of tasteless, soya-bean filled\nnon-existence, and you don\u2019t want to get grouped\nin with those dirty hippies.\nSo why do it?\nStepping away from vegan-freeganism ranting,\neven the odd carnivore is bound to be curious why\nvegetarianism has seen a rising trend in the last\ntwenty years. And I\u2019m not just talking about those\nbastard east-end hipsters being \u201ctrendy\u201d. I\u2019m going\nto be honest, I\u2019m a vegetarian \u2013 but don\u2019t get me\nwrong, meat is F**KING TASTY \u2013 I do not feel\nsick when someone eats a burger next to me, nor\ndo I ask them to move. So let\u2019s give a couple reasons why I gave up my Nando\u2019s and BBQ steak.\nHere there\u2019s going to be a lot of controversy, no\ndoubt. We\u2019ve heard about murdering defenseless\nducklings and the cruelty \u2013 I know what you\u2019re\nthinking \u2013 \u2018it\u2019s nature, suck it up\u2019. However, although I am inclined to agree with the circle of life,\npeople need to understand the consequences of\nwhat they are eating.\nIf it were a chicken and I stuck on a desert island\nI would take him out before he tried to become\nfriends with me, but we live in a society where the\nconsumption of meat has become unhealthy. Back\nin the day when it was us, a spear and the wild, we\nworked for our food in a fair fight and we ate as\nmuch as we could catch that would sustain us.\nWe now live in a society where most animals\nthat you buy on the high street are raised in an unnatural manner. Animals are often reared in poor\nconditions and treated totally inhumanly, despite\nthe efforts of organizations such as the RSPCA, to\nsatisfy our cravings. On average the British consume 1000 calories more than necessary \u2013 this and\ntoo much meat has been proven to cause long-term\nhealth problems. A lot of lives are going to waste\nover wanting to slap a chicken fillet on the grill\nwithout thinking about where it\u2019s sourced.\nYou may not think that all animals are sentient,\nbut if you have a pet who you know full well loves\nyou, animals with the same level of intelligence\nare getting battery farmed into packaged meat.\nYou want to be sure that they should have a good\nstandard of life.Anyone out there who claims they\nlove animals is ultimately hypocritical if they never\ntake into consideration where their food is sourced-you can\u2019t pick and choose which animals deserve\nwelfare.\nThis is where you find some of the most compelling arguments for vegetarianism, which are sadly\nnot that well publicized. Hippie or not, for a sustainable future vegetarianism is not just speculative\nmalarkey.The facts speak for themselves \u2013 the way\nwe consume meat is unsustainable.\nI am certainly not saying that vegetarianism is\nthe way forward for everyone \u2013 I will never be one\nof those people to call another person wrong in this\nrespect. However, the way in which we consume is\ninarguably flawed.\n18% of C02\nand 37% of methane emissions are\nattributable to livestock; that\u2019s more CO2\nthan all\ntransport put together. The resources pumped into\nlivestock rearing are unbelievable \u2013 70% of agricultural space is used up either in grazing animals\nor for growing food to raise them, so this crap\nabout vegetables taking up more space is bunt.\nOne of the biggest issues we face is water con-sumption. It\u2019s been argued that our crops take the\nmajority percentage of unsustainable global water\nuse \u2013 and to some extent this is true. However, so\nmuch of what we grow goes on to feed our livestock that things are put into perspective \u2013 one kilo\nof meat uses up 6x more water than a kilo of wheat.\nFinally, transport. There is the argument that\nwith globalization we are increasingly getting vegetables that have come from the other side of the\nworld. This is a dilemma \u2013 localized sourcing is always more sustainable, but cutting off trade means\nwe are neglecting to use it as a way to bring people\nout of poverty. However, because of the amount of\nresources necessary to rear the amount of livestock\nwe are consuming, it actually all the air miles from\nyour vegetables actually add up to a lower environmental impact than eating the same amount of\nmeat.\nSo you still don\u2019t want to be a vegetarian \u2013 what\ncan you do?\nFair do\u2019s \u2013 not everyone can give up meat. I\nknow how hard it is, I had to wean myself off meat,\nand fear meat relapses where I become an animal-istic murderer. But there is still so much that can\nbe done.\nYou can reduce our carbon footprint, become\nmore ethical and save money by just cutting down.\nIn the UK, meat makes up about 16% of the average diet \u2013 if everyone cut down to a quarter of\nthis we would have cut down enough to meet all\nfood based cuts to be reached by 2020. Also, stop\nwasting food at home \u2013 30% of food goes to waste,\nwhich equates to a huge amount of cumulative re-sources.\nStart off small \u2013 try cutting down a little bit at\na time. You don\u2019t have to eat as much meat at every meal, or every day. Quitting on meat a couple\ntimes a week is not going to break your soul and\nwillpower now \u2013 it\u2019s easy and you probably won\u2019t\nnotice that much of a different to your lifestyle.\nIf you want to cut down but aren\u2019t sure how,\nwow this sounds like an AA ad, you can always\ncheck out different meal plans with the Part-Time\nCarnivore Project. There are so many ways that\nyou can organize your diet so that it is sustainable\nand incorporates your favorite foods: http://www.\nparttimecarnivore.org/\nIf you want to get your geek on, you can double-check all the horrific facts and figures: http://pubs.\nacs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es702969f\nInterested in how food consumption effects the\nenvironment and check out what else you can\ndo: http://www.wwf.org.uk/what_we_do/cam-paigning/food_campaign/livewell_2020/\nVegetarianism: Only for Hippies?\nApril Williamson\nFUN FACTS!

    "content": "SCIENCE\nIn brief\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nW\ne can all name famous\npsychopaths, be they the\nfictional Hannibal Lecter\nor real life Jack the Ripper.\nThey can cause fear or uneasiness in even the most hardy of us. But what\nreally makes a serial killer? Why are psychopaths so different from \u2018us\u2019?\nThe Horizon episode, Are you Good or\nEvil, examined the search for a so-called\n\u2018moral gene\u2019. At a fundamental level, humans are animals, so how did we come to\npossess morals, something other than instinct\nor self-motivation to guide our actions?\nPaul Bloom and Karen Wynn designed an\nexperiment to see if children were naturally\nborn with a sense of morality or whether it\nwas something they learned growing up. The\nexperiment consisted of showing children a\nplay with one \u2018good\u2019 character and one \u2018bad\u2019\ncharacter. When asked to choose a character,\nalmost 70% picked the \u2018good\u2019 one, as most\npeople presumably would.\nBut what about the 30% that were drawn to\nthe bad character? Would they become bullies or \u2018troublemakers\u2019?\nAnother aspect of the show looked at military marines who were trained to fight, defend and, when necessary, kill. At a training\nbase in the USA, marines are trained to act on\ninstincts that have been drilled into them by\nyears of training. This is necessary because\nwhen under pressure, they cannot afford to\nwaste time reviewing actions; after years of\ndiscipline, the body reacts in the way it needs\nto, even if it means taking a life.\nBut one cannot ignore the idea of right and\nwrong. It is the reason why ex-soldiers returning from battle cannot readjust to society \u2013 they have lost their sense of morality\nand hold more than just the opposing army in\ncontempt; they struggle to have empathy for\nanyone. As Captain Jack Hoban, a US Marine Corp, says \u201cHumans are not natural born\nkillers.\u201d Psychologically, they cannot handle\nthe idea of killing with morality, so they lose\nthis sense all together.\nHowever, not all soldiers are psychopaths.\nThe Marines soon realised that instead of\nturning cadets into killers, they should turn\nthem into \u2018protectors\u2019. Protectors would only\nkill when absolutely necessary; rather then\nremove their moral compass, they would \u2018recalibrate\u2019 it.\nBoth neurobiologists and psychologists\nhave worked extensively into finding a chemical or gene that gives us our moral traits.\nBob Hare is a psychologist who has looked\nparticularly far into this field.\nOn the outside, serial killers look normal\nand just like everyone else; no sign of self-inflicted wounds or grotesque disfigure-ments. Psychologically however, they seem\nto have a profound lack of empathy and an\negocentric mind-set. They are not necessarily unemotional, but while emotions usually guide us to act, the psychopath feels no\ncompulsion; they could very easily slaughter\ninnocent victims, despite understanding the\nemotional impact.\nIn order to test this, Bob Hare brain scanned\nknown serial killers using MRI while words\nwere displayed on a screen. Monitoring the\nbrain\u2019s impulses, Hare noticed that emotional\nwords trigger certain synapses for most peo-ple. In the psychopaths\u2019 brains, there was indifference in responses to both emotional and\nregular words. Hare soon developed a \u2018psychopathic checklist\u2019 that tested things like\npersonality, how you would react to certain\nsituations and impulsivity.\nProfessor James Fallon, a psychologist\nworking in the field of disorders like depression and schizophrenia, was asked to analyse\na variety of PET scans to deduce the characteristics of the people to whom they per-tained. One common theme emerged: the activity of two areas of the brain seemed to split\nthe group, the orbital cortex and parts of the\ntemporal lobe that surrounds the amygdala.\nThese areas are known to control animal impulses and decision-making. All of the scans\nwith damage in these areas came from serial\nkillers. Was this the sole cause of psychopaths\u2019 behaviour?\nIn 1993, one family was tested used genetic analysis. All of the males in this family\nhad a background in violence and, interest-ingly, all of them had a mutation of the same\ngene sequence. The findings then showed\nthat a variant of the MAO-A gene promoter\n(or \u2018warrior gene\u2019 as it became known), could\nalso lead to psychopathic behaviour later in\nlife.\nOur brain chemistry and genetic mutations\ncan reveal the traits corroborating with psychopathic behaviour. But will everyone with\nNatural born killers?\nPavitar Devgon on what makes some people become psychopaths\nthe genetic mutation become serial killers?\nThe idea seems so wrong.\nWhile visiting his family, James Fallon\nwas asked by his mother to research his father\u2019s relatives. He discovered that there was\na lineage of violent killers in the family dating as far back as 1667. James decided to test\nhis immediate family using PET scans. Only\none brain showed classic psychopathic behaviour \u2013 his. Continuing further, he found\nthat he had also inherited the \u2018warrior gene\u2019.\nBoth characteristics were there and yet he\nwas not a psychopath. He did have certain\ntraits such as hot-headedness, lack of patience and at times, an uncaring attitude, all\ncommon amongst serial killers. This showed\nthat the mind-set was there, but not at an extreme level.\nInterestingly, the traits of psychopaths \u2013\nimpulsiveness, an uncaring demeanour and\nlack of pathos \u2013 can be found in professional\njobs, such as CEOs and leaders of big cor-porations. Many of these people would rank\nhighly on Hare\u2019s checklist. It\u2019s interesting\nhow someone with a similar mind to a killer\ncould work so well in business and society.\nNot that all bosses are psychopaths.\nFortunately, there emerged a third factor\nthat ultimately determines your \u2018destiny\u2019:\nyour childhood. If you have the genes and\nbrain patterns, a nurturing childhood environment can reduce and even remove the\nrisk of becoming a psychopath. Conversely,\na damaging, dysfunctional, abusive childhood could trigger the aggressive genes.\nYour genes may lay the foundations, but\nyour upbringing dominates who you will\nbecome.\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nHow quickly would you turn to killing your friends in order to live?\nFollow the latest science news\nfrom Imperial and more on our\nFacebook page:\nfacebook.com/FelixScience\nLike us on Facebook\nConfused by DOIs?\nDOI stands for digitial object identifier.

The fundamentalist\natheist finally sees that the existence\nof the ultimate voyeur (as Sartre\nwould put it\u2026) is still very much up\nfor debate.\u201d What has brought about\nthis paradigm shift?\nThe past couple of weeks have seen\na hurricane of religious and at some\npoints even rational debate. PhilSoc\u2019s\n\u201cIs there a rational proof for God\u201d\ndebate, a guest lecture from William\nLane Craig and a flurry of Felix articles on related topics have raised\nthe age old issue of God and religion\nagain.\nAt this stage I must confess. As a\nfundamentalist, I have not changed\nmy mind. My dogmatic faith in rea-son, evidence and rational thinking\nremain an obstacle. Brainwashed by\nBertrand Russell I cannot see the utility of adopting beliefs which are untrue or at best unlikely. Thus, just as\nI have faith in the non-existence of\nunicorns, fairies and girls studying\nCompSci, I also believe, yes believe,\nthat anything like the God of Abraham\nfalls into this category. I would like to\nremind the reader that it would be impolite to pooh-pooh at my faith at this\nstage, as that would be disrespectful\nand cause offence. As we all know it is\noutrageous to dispute someone\u2019s faith.\nKishan Manani\nI want an armistice\nFlogging a dead God\nI write this article in response to an\narticle written two weeks ago entitled\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably no Dawkins\u2026\u201d\nin which Joshua asks \u201cwhy does\nDawkins refuse to debate Craig?\u201d. It\nappears that Joshua\u2019s queries were\nanswered when Dawkins himself\nwrote an article (20th October) in The\nGuardian entitled \u201cWhy I refuse to\ndebate William Lane Craig.\u201d\u2026 The\nonly real question to ask is whether\nDawkins\u2019 reasons are legitimate. I\nshall not venture down such an alley\nand let the reader make up their own\nmind after reading Dawkins\u2019 article.\nI\u2019d rather get to the next point.\nThe closing remark of Joshua\u2019s article was of most interest. The article\nclaims that 4000 views of a YouTube\nvideo of Craig arguing for the existence of God indicates that this area\nis \u201cstill a hot topic\u2026\u201d and \u201cvery much\nopen for debate\u201d. Being a blind follower in the Cult of Dawkins I decided to examine the claims and use\nreason to come to a conclusion.\nFifty minutes of my life were\nthrown into the past as I watched the\nCraig lecture. Unsurprisingly, Craig\nwas flogging a dead God. All of his arguments are at least 500 years old and\nhave been thoroughly refuted (See\nRussell, Wikipedia, Kant, Google,\nHume). Craig\u2019s arguments included\ngreat classics such as: the ontological\nargument (where God is defined into\nexistence), the cosmological argument\n(causality implies the Universe has a\nfirst unphysical cause, let\u2019s label this\nL\nast week, we marked the\ndeath of millions of sol-diers. They had all died\nin action at some point\nin the last 93 years, since\nthe start of the First World War. The\neleventh day of the eleventh month\nhas been marked in this way for years.\nIn fact, only a handful of people currently alive today were also alive\nwhen it was not. You might think that\nas those who were there in WWI start\nto die, the seriousness would start to\nwane, that the idea would start to lose\nits punch. Even as children we were\nall acutely aware of the significance\nbut also the distance from us. But have\nyou noticed recently how the tone has\nchanged?\nWhen I first knew about it, it was an\nobviously reverential day called Remembrance Day that rarely fell on the\n11th November, as it was bunged over\nto the nearest Sunday. Some people\nwore a poppy for the week or so up\nto that weekend, and not afterwards.\nBy contrast, now, it seems to have regained its previous name, Armistice\nDay, and it really does happen on\nthe 11th November. Almost everyone\nwears a poppy, and many people wear\nblack arm bands or black ribbons as\nwell. There is also a certain uniformity\nto it, with pretty much everyone doing\nit in the same way; many of my French\ncolleagues also wore a poppy despite it\nbeing a symbol of a British charity. Inevitably some people managed to cock\nit up in a thoughtless and shy-making\nway. An American I know updated her\nFacebook status with \u201cHappy 11th November\u201d, proving that she has no idea\nwhat Armistice Day means. I tried to\npoint this out gently but it turned out\nthat all of her friends who bothered\nto comment thought the same as her,\nand as doctors, they do not even have\nthe defence of being stupid. And the\nnutters who choose to complain about\nwars fought half a millennium ago by\nburning large poppies are talked about\nat this sort of time, though their activities are fortunately no longer public.\nSo, we have a change of tone towards\nArmistice Day being taken much more\nseriously, at least in Europe. There\nis no upset about this; there is an inbuilt politeness to anyone in mourning\nthat deflects negative criticism. But\nat any rate, this change seems at odds\nwith the fact that WWI is a far distant\nmemory. The last WWI combat veteran died earlier this year. My grandparents\u2019 generation were amongst the\nyoungest to fight in WWII and they\nare dying out at alarming speed. So\nwhere does it come from, this change\nin tone? It is obviously not a political or governmental thing. Even if the\ncoalition did want to push national\nmourning, it would not work: people\ndo not grieve if they do not want to.\nGod and stop thinking), the teleological argument (the Universe appears to\nbe made for our existence just like the\npuddle on the road thinks the pothole\nwas made for its existence) and many,\nmany more.\nIn Felix\u2019s interview last month,\nCraig was asked whether his belief in\nGod would be diminished if he found\nrefutations (which he found convinc-ing) to the arguments he presented.\nHis response was \u201cI would still have\nmy belief, because my belief in God\nis not based on these arguments\u2026 I\nthink my faith in God is based on the\ninner witness of God\u2019s Spirit\u2026\u201d. The\narguments are not strong enough even\nto convince himself. This and comments in which he explicitly supports\nGod\u2019s instructions to commit a genocide are enough to bring into question\nthe intellectual integrity of any such\ndebater.\nAfter hundreds of years of argu-ment, there has been little progress\nconcerning God\u2019s existence. The debate is only \u201copen\u201d to the extent that\nwe keep reiterating the same arguments and refutations time and time\nagain. On all things concerning supernatural entities which transcend the\nunderstanding, we should take the advice of Ludwig Wittgenstein: \u201cWhat\nwe cannot [intelligibly] speak about\n(i.e. the ineffable) we must pass over\nin silence.\u201d\nThe answer is that they do want to, and\nthis is of course because of the wars in\nIraq and Afghanistan. We have a new\ngeneration of mourners. The tone has\nchanged because pretty much everybody knows someone, knows someone\nwho knows someone, or knows someone who went out with someone who\nknows someone, that was killed in the\nMiddle East. And that does include\n\u2018both sides\u2019 of the war.

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX 11\nFriday 18 NOVEMBER 2011\nFisher\u2019s principle is an evolutionary argument that explains why most sexual species tend to have a stable gender ratio that\napproximates 1:1. The principle is that,\nas one gender increases in abundance,\nthe marginal value of having offspring\nof the other gender increases. So any genetic predisposition to have more of one\ngender than the other gets balanced out.\nMost species exhibit this property, and\nhistorically the gender ratio of Humans at\nbirth has been ~105:100. Males having a\nslight historical surplus due to our greater\ntendency than females to get ourselves\nkilled; fighting wars, hunting bears, or\nsimilar. The stability innate in Fisher\u2019s\nprinciple is elegant, and easily under-stood, and this is why it is celebrated as\none of the greatest arguments in evolutionary theory.\nIn China today there are between 30 and\n50 million men who will die single for the\nsimple reason that they are surplus, there\nsimply aren\u2019t enough women in China for\nthem to marry. Historically the Chinese,\nas with most cultures, have favoured male\noffspring over females; however Fisher\u2019s\nprinciple has seen that the advantage of\nhaving female offspring has never been\nweakened.As people have promoted their\nsons, any resultant surplus has been met\nby greater breeding success for the pool\nof girls, maintaining the gender balance.\nThe one-child policy wreaked havoc with\nthis. Given the choice many more parents\npreferred sons to daughters. Orphanages\nbegan to fill with abandoned daughters,\nand by the early eighties the official sex\nratio at birth in China had risen to 108\nboys to 100 girls.\nIn one sense children are an investment\nfor parents, an investment which comes\nto fruition in old age, when the children\nbecome the providers and care-givers for\nthe elderly parents. In this context males\nare seen as preferable; historically they\nhave been much better equipped to earn\nthe money needed to support the parents.\nDaughters are somewhat of a dead-end,\ngenerally married away into a family\nwhich they would then support, replaced\nby wives married in to accompany sons.\nThis system only works when there is an\nadequate supply of women to be wives,\nand in China the relative birth rate of\nwomen was falling fast during the 80s\nand 90s, dangerously so.\nThe second blow to gender balance was\nthe advent of screening for gender using\nultrasound. Although sex-specific abortions are illegal in China that has done\nlittle to close the Pandora\u2019s box combination of the one-child policy, the possibility to effectively \u2018pick\u2019 your child\u2019s gen-der, and a social pressure to have sons. By\nthe turn of the millennium China\u2019s sex ratio at birth had hit 120 boys to 100 girls,\ninflating an already wide gender gap.\nThis situation has posed a series of\nproblems for both the government, and\nsociety. Within society there is now an\nextensive group of effectively unmar-riageable men. While marriage is not\nnecessarily the ultimate goal in life, it is\nsomething many people strive for. These\nmen are not evenly distributed across society either. In accordance with Fisher\u2019s\nprinciple, as women have become scarc-er, their marginal value has increased and\nsingle women have a leverage that is not\npresent in societies with healthy gender\nratios. In a curiously retrograde way, it\ncreates a twisted form of social mobil-ity, as women are able to marry upwards,\nshould they so chose.The losers in this are\nthe poor, the rural, the unskilled and the\nunfortunate. A surplus of males is never\ngood for a country, it can lead to unrest,\nand you might expect violence against\nwomen, abductions and forced marriages\nto become more common. There is also\nMarcus Shepheard\nChina is living proof of Fisher\u2019s principle\nQuantum information\nTwo developing technologies have\nbeen touted to mark the emergence of\nnew quantum systems. Published in the\njournal Science last month, the fields of\nplasmonics and nanophotonics promise\nto speed up the advent of quantum information systems, which are capable\nof achieving processing powers that are\norders of magnitude larger than classical computers.\nQuantum computers operate by manipulating photons to represent binary\ndigits, and can harness quantum mechanical effects to provide superior\nparallelism during processing. These\nsystems use Quantum Bits (or qubits)\nin order to represent a larger number of\nstates with fewer bits compared to classical machines.\nMetamaterials, artificial nanostruc-tured objects with exotic properties,\nwill be used in combination with optical\nemitters to improve transfer rates and\ndata processing. This hybrid technology\nwhich takes advantage of the emerging\nfields of plasmonics and nanophotonics\nwill allow \u2018quantum light\u2019 to be used in\nfuture machines.\nProfessor Vladimir Shalaev, scientific\ndirector of nanophotonics at Purdue\nUniversity\u2019s Birck Nanotechnology\nCenter, said that the technology, being\na \u201cseamless interface\u201d between the two\nfields, \u201ccould guarantee the use of light\nto overcome limitations in the operational speed of conventional integrated\ncircuits\u201d.\nResearchers propose the use of plas-mon-mediated interactions, which are\ndevices that can manipulate individual\nphotons and quasiparticles such as plas-mons, combining electrons and photons\ntogether, in order to increase circuit\nthroughput.\nThe individual photons and plasmons\ncan be coupled by way of a nanowire,\na technique pioneered at Harvard University allowing data to be encoded one\nphoton at a time, increasing transfer\nrates of meaningful output. The use of\nhyperbolic metamaterials is another approach which will allow recording and\nreading data with single photons. \u201cWe\nneed a very efficient source of single\nphotons\u201d, Shalaev said, \u201cthe challenge\nhere is to increase the efficiency of\ngeneration of single photons in a broad\nspectrum, and that is where plasmonics\nand metamaterials come in\u201d.\nOne obstacle quantum computers\nhope to overcome is the challenge of\npreserving entangled quantum information long enough to be read and record-ed. A possible solution involves the use\nof diamond with \u201cnitrogen vacancies\u201d.\nThese are natural defects which occur in\nthe crystal lattice of diamonds. \u201cThe nitrogen vacancy in diamond operates in\na very broad spectral range and at room\ntemperature, which is very important\u201d,\nShalaev commented.\nThe hybrid technologies will be put to\nuse along with work from the new research field of diamond photonics. Hyperbolic metamaterials integrated with\nnitrogen vacant diamonds are expected\nto work to produce single photons efficiently and hasten the onset of stable\nquantum information systems.\nAlexander Karapetian\nAn individual nitrogen vacancy centre in diamond can be used as a Qubit\nthe human cost, with many poor men who\nare unable to find a wife facing an old\nage without a companion, without children to bring them joy or care for them.\nFinally there is the issue of competition\nbetween males; older men who have had\nmore time to accumulate wealth have\nan advantage over younger males from\ncomparable backgrounds, and so there\nis a tendency for the age difference between male and female partners to grow,\nas older men outcompete younger, poorer\nmen for the few available girls. None of\nthese outcomes are positive, and yet there\nare no simple solutions to easily bring the\ngender gap down.\nDespite this there is evidence that Fisher\u2019s principle is in effect; the increased\nvalue of daughters in such an imbalanced\nsociety is starting to be noted, and in the\nlast few years the ratio at birth has been\nfalling. It is now down to around 118\nmales to 100 females, which while still\nseverely imbalanced, is an improvement.\nThere are few direct interventions any\ngovernment can impose to ameliorate this\nsort of situation. Rescinding the one-child\npolicy offers no guarantee that people\nwill not continue to pursue a \u2018sons first\u2019\npolicy, and keep abandoning or aborting\ndaughters. There is a possibility of offering direct incentives to people producing\ngirls, but this offers up the worrying concept of placing a value on a child\u2019s life,\nwhen that value should be innate. It also\ndoesn\u2019t consider the financial burden to\nthe country. Ultimately, the most powerful changes China could make would\nhave to be social. Empowering women as\nwage earners equal to men would weaken\nthe concept of men as providers. Offering better end-of-life care so that parents\nare not so dependent on children for support would have a similar range of social\nbenefits, albeit at a cost. Fundamentally\nthere needs to be a change to the historical\npatriarchal paradigm so that society sees\nwomen as equal in potential and value to\nmales, at every level of society, not just\nin the educated middle and upper classes.\nThese changes are not simple, and China\nis not the only country that will find itself needing to implement them. While\nChina\u2019s situation is more pronounced,\nIndia and Indonesia are examples of other\ncountries with a growing surplus of males\nthat will need to be balanced out in the\nfuture. It is too late for the millions of surplus men in these countries, but hopefully\nin time, things can return to a more balanced state, for the benefit of all people\nliving in the country.\nHow we can explain China\u2019s gender ratios from an evolutionary standpoint and\nwhat they mean to imbalances in the rest of the world\n\n"

After having the Rugby first XV\ncaptain last week, we turn to an equally\npopular (and equally gruelling) sport.\nLive from the Boathouse in Putney,\nRowing Club Captain Patrick Hudson\nanswers my questions.\nI have always been slightly in awe\nof rowers, with their steely, up-at-the-crack-of-dawn training ethos and their\nsheer drive for success. Somewhat in-evitably, the first question I ask Patrick\nrevolves around this: where does he\nfind the motiviation to get up at such\nscarily hours to train?\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where the motivation\ncomes from...Possibly the fact that I\nlive at the Boathouse and my crew will\nbang on my door to get up?\u201d Ah, it\u2019s all\nabout location then? Not quite, he says:\n\u201cSeriously though, it\u2019s a rewarding\nsport and we do everything we can to\nwin \u2013 anything less wouldn\u2019t be good\nenough.\u201d Impressive stuff.\nMy next question is about the Boat\nClub itself. Historically, it is one of Imperial\u2019s strongest sporting outfits, with\nthe Putney Boathouse a testament to\nthat fact. What is the level of the current senior squad? How has the club\nfared in recent years?\nPatrick proudly admits that \u201clast season saw our best performance in the\nlast few years\u201d:\n\u201cA 4th place out of 300 for the girls\nat Women\u2019s Eights Head of the River;\nwinners of the University Pennant and\nfour crews in the top 25 out of 400\nat the Men\u2019s Eights Head \u2013 no club\nmatched that achievement, student\nor otherwise. Those successes were\nfollowed by wins and strong performances at the Henley Regattas in the\nsummer. The current squad is in great\nshape and looks set to build on last\nyear\u2019s achievements.\u201d\nI ask him to elaborate further; what\nare the main objectives for this season?\n\u201cThe most prestigious events for us\nare the Eight\u2019s Head races in March,\nthen Henley Royal Regatta and Henley Women\u2019s Regatta in the summer.\nBuilding the fastest possible crews to\ncompete and win at these regattas is\nour focus.\u201d What about BUCS points?\n\u201cBUCS is good fun,\u201d he says, \u201cand\nwe\u2019ll put in a strong performance to\ndo our bit for the uni, but it\u2019s not our\nultimate goal.\u201d Sport Imperial do have\nsome lofty objectives for this season,\nbut I feel that Patrick and the boat club\nwill deliver \u2013 his hunger for winning is\nunmistakeable.\nMoving on to something slightly dif-ferent, I ask about an association that a\nlot of people make in their minds: the\none between rowing and the Olympics.\nIt\u2019s a very exciting time for any sports-man-or-woman to be in London; will\nany Imperial rowers be involved in the\nGames?\n\u201cMel Wilson from Imperial is in the\nWomen\u2019s Quadruple Sculls and Adam\nFreeman-Pask, an alumnus who still\nrows with us, is also in the frame for\na seat. Both Mel and Adam competed\nat the World Championships this year.\u201d\nAfter my noises of wonder and excitement subside, Patrick continues: \u201cA\nfew club members are volunteering at\nDorney Lake and for the rest of us, or\nthose lucky enough to get tickets, we\u2019ll\nbe cheering for GB from the bank.\u201d\nPersonally, I\u2019ll be cheering on any\nImperial athlete who makes it to the\ngames \u2013 in any sport.\nSpeaking of cheering, what of the social side of rowing? We don\u2019t often see\nthe oarpeople (not sure if that\u2019s PC or\nnot? \u2013 Ed.) around the union, as they\ntend to be down by the boathouse any-way. Does he have the time to take a\nbreather and enjoy a drink with your\nrowing mates, I ask \u2013 or is the training\nregime just too strict?\nAccording to Patrick, it\u2019s about getting the balance right: \u201cTraining is demanding but there\u2019s a big social side\nbuilt around the Boathouse and the\nfact that most of us live in Putney. We\nnormally save the mad-for-it nights out\nfor after races.\u201d He then lets me in on\na further piece of (confidential?) infor-mation: \u201cICSMBC were kind enough\nto expose the weaknesses in our drinking ability at our joint pub crawl recently . . . maybe we should work on\nthat, but we wouldn\u2019t want to steal\ntheir thunder.\u201d Wise words from the\ncaptain there.\nFinally, as is customary, I ask him a\nbit about himself. How did he get into\nrowing? \u201cI started rowing as a beginner in my first year at IC by default \u2013\nI was too fat at the time to make the\nsquash team. It\u2019s incredibly addictive\nand I like the potential for personal\nEssential info:\nPatrick Hudson, 22\n75 kg, 181.5 cm, arm span: 186 cm\n3 years\u2019 rowing experience\nInformation Systems MEng Undergrad\ndevelopment as well as teamwork.\u201d I\ncan\u2019t help but think that squash lost out\nsomewhere along the way.\nWhat have his personal achivements\nbeen so far, then? He is hesitant to\nmake much of this question \u2013 unsure\nwhether people are going to be interested or not. I tell him that most students are interested in seeing the people behind the clubs. \u201cWell, I won three\nBUCS gold medals last year, and came\n23rd at Men\u2019s Eights (also in 2011)\nwinning a pennant.\nOn the back of that, I think it\u2019s safe\nto say: bring on the races!

    "content": "BUSINESS\nFELIX Friday 18 november 2011 17\nIt was perhaps due to the imperfect\nknowledge or absolute ignorance humankind had back then that true polymaths could still exist; nowadays, in the\nage of specialization, it seems almost\nimpossible. But back in the old days,\nthe same person, if gifted and lucky\nenough, could undertake forefront research in the most diverse areas and\nmake enormous contributions, large\nenough for their names to be remem-bered. Thomas Young (1773-1890), a\nphysician by training, was such a poly-math.\nEngineers will always remember his\nname through Young\u2019s modulus. Physicists, because he established (or un-earthed) the wave theory of light. Physicians, because he explained colour\nperception and described astigmatism.\nMusicians, due to the Young tempera-ment. Egyptologists, for his partial (and\ntruly remarkable) decipherment of hi-eroglyphics. Capillarity, surface ten-sion, haemodynamics, comparative phi-lology, the double-slit experiment, the\nmeasurement of the speed of light, all\nof it was due to Thomas Young.\nHis interests being so wide, it comes\nalmost to no surprise that Young did not\nonly endeavour in all that, but became\na successful businessman as well. It all\nwas triggered by a huge economic cri-sis: the \u201cPanic of 1825\u201d.\nFollowing the Napoleonic invasion of\nthe Iberian peninsula, the Kingdom of\nSpain, formerly the biggest colonial\npower in Europe, lost its grip in South\nAmerica: one by one, all the countries\nfrom Mexico down to Chile and Argentina became independent, a process that\nfinished in 1821 in Peru. The Spanish\nEmpire had usually taken a protectionist stance and, even though a certain\namount of smuggling had existed, trade\nbetween their American colonies and\nEurope had been restricted to Spaniards\nalone.\nTherefore, when the independence\nprocess was complete, British financiers saw the newly former countries\nas a great chance of entering a hitherto\nforbidden market. They were the days\nfollowing Napoleons defeat, when Britain had established itself as the dominant power. Little regulation existed\non the banking sector, as little practice\non financial markets existed. Thus, the\ninitially alluring investments in Latin\nAmerica rapidly attracted too many in-vestors, and speculation followed.\nAt the height of this speculative pro-Thomas Young\u2019s\nEntrepreneurial\nEndeavours\ncess, fortunes could be made by investing in non-existent factories, by\ntrading incredible amounts of Latin\nAmerican public debt, or by buying\nand selling land titles in the middle of\nthe jungle, where colonies where allegedly going to be built out of nowhere.\nAdventurers also entered the game:\nsome Gregor MacGregor (1786-1845),\nwho had formerly fought in the South\nAmerican wars of independence, publicly proclaimed himself ruler of the\nfictitious Principality of Poyais, and\nsuccessfully drew City investors and\ncolonists into this fraudulent venture.\nColonists would land in Panama only to\ndiscover Poyais did not exist, and that\nMacGregor, safely living in Caracas,\nhad just taken the money and fled.\nThe madness of those days is hard to\nmatch, but not perhaps its sophistica-tion, as the recent and ongoing crisis\nhas shown. And, as it happened in 2007,\nthe bubble could only burst. By 1825,\nindustrial revolution in Europe had\nmade some other investments rather at-tractive, too: suddenly, railroads, heavy\nmachinery, coal mining, steelworks,\u2026\nbecame obvious and more trustworthy\ninvestments. However, most City banks\nhad their money placed on Latin American ventures; so, in order to finance the\nformer, they simply decided sell off\nthe latter. As it became obvious that no\none really wanted the Latin American\nassets, panic grew and, inevitably, the\nLondon Stock Exchange crashed.\nBanks, the main backers of the speculative investments, were the first and\nmajor victims of the crash. Sixty English banks, including six of the major ten, declared bankruptcy as panic\nspread; but the main survivor, and undoubtedly the biggest culprit, was the\nBank of England, which back then was,\nessentially, a chartered yet private business that, as such, had heavily fuelled\nthe bubble. Ironically, the British government had to allow the humiliating\nbail-out of the Bank of England by no\nother than the Banque de France, which\ninfused its colleague with enough gold\nreserves to prevent its collapse. The\ncrisis spread to the rest of Europe, and\nprompted a general default of Latin\nAmerican debt. Governments worldwide promptly learnt the lesson: banks,\nleft alone and unregulated, can cause\ngreat trouble. Thus, for the first time in\nhistory, banking policing and regulations were established.\nThe resulting business environment\nwas, as it is nowadays, one of uncertainty and distrust. The bubble had\nshown quite clearly the need of assessing risk and of prudent expansion. That\nwas how the Palladium Insurance Company, which had been founded amidst\nthe general excitement of this period,\nfelt in the aftermath. They saw the need\nof looking for ways of assessing the risk\nof the insurances they offered so that\nthey could be priced accordingly, and\nmoney made in a certain and prudent\nway, rather than through adventurous\ngames in the Stock Exchange.\nHowever, at that time risk assessment\nand pricing were in its teens, and knowing of Thomas Young\u2019s fame and exper-tise, they thought he could be the most\nsuitable person for a job consisting on,\nessentially, re-structuring the insurance\nbusiness on scientific grounds. They attracted him in the most generous way; a\nbig salary of \u00a3500 was offered to him,\nalong with a considerable number of\nstock shares. However, Young apparently thought the deal was too good for\nhim: he refused these liberal terms and,\nafter some negotiations, accepted the\njob for \u00a3400 per annum alone.\nYoung was of an inquisitive and rigorous mind. Sometime earlier in his life\nhe had proposed an empirical equation\nfor calculating the value of life and, after working on the issue, came up with\na formula calculating the joint value of\nany number of lives too. This method,\nalthough cold-hearted and rather im-perfect, outperformed any other current\npractice. His analysis, based on statistical data on the number of yearly deaths\nof people of different social positions\nin different locations, allowed him for\nthe first time to estimate individual life\nexpectancy and, thus, to price life insurances based on the probability someone\nhad to die in the near future. He kept\nadding factors into his formula, (diet,\nprofession, family antecedents,...), to\nthe point of making his method too\ncomplicated for anyone but himself.\nNevertheless, being more thorough and\nserious in his analyses than anyone else,\nYoung was quite successful and helped\nthe Palladium Company make a great\nprofit.\nWhile working on these issues for the\nPalladium Company, he realised that his\nscientific approach could be extended\nto some other areas of business. For in-stance, his centred his attention in the\nmarket of \u201cannuities\u201d. For the layman,\nan annuity is a contract, usually between\na pension fund holder and an insurance\ncompany, by virtue of which the pensioner hands over his pension fund \u2013 or,\nequivalently, a great deal of money \u2013 to\nthe insurance company under the agreement that the insurance company will\nthen pay the pensioner, for the remaining of his life, a certain income \u2013the an-nuity. Annuity titles could be purchased\nand sold in the market, and obviously\nthe risk was in the subject living too\nlong for making the business not profit-able. Young applied his methodology to\nthis market too, and he was able to calculate annuities on single or joint lives\nand minimise the losses of the insurer.\nBy the time of his death (1829), his\nscientific insight into the insurance\nbusiness had attracted enough attention\nto allow dubbing Young the father of\nmodern insurancing.\nBernhardt Kreuzweg-Burgheim\nThomas Young \u2013 the man, the myth, the polymath\n\n"

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX 15\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 18 november 2011\nPalestinian students visit Imperial\nExchange students reveal their thoughts on Palestine\u2019s struggle for recognition\nRajat Jain\nHaifa Ansari Zacharia Zanoon\nOn Tuesday, Imperial was visited by a\ngroup of six Palestinian university students spending eleven days in London\nas part of a cultural exchange. Felix\ntook the opportunity to speak to them.\nIn particular, I spoke to HaifaAnsari,\na final year law student and Zacharia\nZanoon, a second year dentistry stu-dent. Both are from fairly similar back-grounds, part of the growing young\nwell-educated Palestinian middle class\nand got on well with each other, seemingly holding a similar world view.\nCertainly, both have a sincere liking\nfor the British people, despite seeing\nBritish policy as being partly responsible for the conflict. This reflects my\nown experience of the urban parts of\nthe West Bank, where the locals were\nalways excited to meet tourists (even if\nthey had nothing to sell), and had a rather positive reaction to hearing we were\nBritish. It is also hard to find any Palestinians who would trust Israeli\u2019s from\nany faction to be true to their word. Israel has long resisted a Palestinian state\nout of legitimate concerns that the new\nstate will need to be guaranteed to not\nbe a threat to its national security. It is\ninteresting to see that most Palestinians\nfeel the same concern about Israel.\nHowever, scratch the surface, and\na clear line still emerges among the\nPalestinians. When asked about Israel, neither would recognise a \u2018right\u2019\nto exist, but while Haifa would accept\ntheir existence, Zacharia would not. He\nalso believed that force was absolutely\nnecessary and the main measure by\nwhich Palestinian \u2018freedom\u2019 would be\ngained. Haifa, however, believed that\ndiplomacy would be successful given\nenough time and peace was of the utmost importance. She also appeared\nto be rather more sceptical of governments (whether allies or enemies of Israel), and believed that pressure from\npeople around the world would have a\ngreater impact.\nAlthough they are hardly representative of the whole of Palestinian soci-ety, the contrasting views of these two\nstudents reflects some of the key problems that will still face the Palestinian\npeople, even if a more moderate Israeli\ngovernment comes into power. ICU President Scott Heath (third from left) and a few Imperial students posing with the students from Palestine\nZ: It was not a waste; at least we tried to improve the situation. We\nmust try every option available to us.\nH: No, I don\u2019t think it was. We were expecting the bid to fail. But it\nhas led to membership of UNESCO and greater knowledge of the\nplight of the Palestinian people.\nZ: Of course forceful action will be necessary. If Israel uses violence\nagainst me, I will respond in the same way. What else can we do?\nSome of them [Israelis] believe that if you kill an Arab child, you will\nenter paradise! We do not: we only use violence because it is used\nagainst us.\nH: No, not necessarily. The majority of Palestinians are still peaceful\nand want peace. The membership to UNESCO is still a small step in\nthe right direction. As long as there are small steps, Palestinians will\nremain hopeful.\nZ: Of course, any country who supports us is our ally and we shall\naccept their support.\nH: We will take support from any country that gives it to us. But this\ndoes not mean we support their own internal politics. The Palestinian\npeople will always gladly accept support from anyone who sincerely\noffers it. It is, however, people who can help us, not governments.\nZ: The British left the Jews here in 1948 and are responsible for the\nsituation we are in. But now, we have come here and got so much sup-port. The British are now our friends. They understand our problems\nand support us. There are so many organisations in Britain, such as\nthe one that brought us here, that are helping us.\nZ: Let me ask you: If someone comes and takes your land, everything you own, would you offer to share it with them? Israel does not\nhave any right to this land. All the land is Palestine. There may be no\npeaceful solution. Even when the Oslo agreement was being signed,\nthe Israeli prime minister was lying to us. The Zionists are liars- they\ncannot be trusted. The Jews here in London are peaceful. The Zionists are not. Let me tell you a story. A boy complains to his father that\nhis bedroom is too small. His father tells him to get a cow and put it\nin his room. The boy does so and now complains it is even small. His\nfather tells him to take two sheep and put them in. The boy does so\nand continues to complain. The father tells him to put five chickens\nin his room. The boy complains he can barely fit. The father says take\nthe cow out. The boy says it feels bigger. Now the father says take a\nsheep out. The boy says the room now feels very large. This is what\nthe Israelis are trying to convince us of!\nH: The British people have shown their support for us. We do not see\nthe government and the people as the same. There are a large number of organisations who you can visit to support us. I urge British people to come and visit Palestine and see the suffering of our people.\nH: I do not accept the right of Israel to exist as they have taken our\nland. But, I can see that they view it as their home. If it would bring\npeace, I would accept the two states though. But, this would have to\nbe a final peaceful state. I do not know if the Palestinians can trust\nIsrael to be peaceful.\nPalestine has taken the policy of turning to other countries for recognition of their state. Given their failure to gain UN membership,\nwas this policy a waste of time?\nCountries such as Iran and Syria claim to support the Palestinian\npeople but focus more on being anti-Israeli. Do you consider them to\nbe true allies? Does Palestine have any true allies?\nBritain has been a strong ally of Israel and does not recognise Palestine. What is your view of the British and has it changed since you\narrived? Is there anything British people who support the Palestinians can do?\nDo you accept Israel\u2019s right to exist? Do you support a two state\nsolution?\nGiven the failings of the diplomatic route, are the Palestinians likely\nto take more forceful action?\nWould you like to report on a political issue\nthat means something to you?\nEmail us at: politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nRajat Jain\nPolitics Editors: Joseph Letts\nRajat Jain\n\u201cScratch the surface,\nand a clear line still\nemerges among the\nPalestinians.\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "GREEN WEEK\n23\nFELIX Friday 18 november 2011\nWhen I was very young, I learnt to ride a\nbike at the same time as my big sister. We\nlived on the coast, and I still remember\nwhizzing along the wide promenade with\nthe grey channel on the left, the stabilisers\ndigging in alternately as I threaded a wild\nS along the Tarmac.As a teenager cycling\nbecame a method of liberation, of visiting\nfriends at the opposite end of town and in\nrural villages, without needing parents,\nwithout needing to drive, without the impossible cost of owning a car.\nOn coming to Imperial, my physical\nworld shrank as my many options ex-panded. I always meant to get cycling\nagain, but due to a combination of dis-organisation and a dark underlying fear\nof the congested roads I lived in London\nwithout a bike for many years. I understood the city as these spheres of existence\naround tube stations and bus terminals. Of\ncourse I had an A-Z, and I sometimes set\noff on long walks but soon found myself\ntramping through the enormous wastelands that separate civilisation. The cost of\ntravel limited how I spent my time, I lived\nwithin walking distance of college and deviating far from the corridor I trudged everyday cost money and time. I lived in the\nlargest city in Europe, but I may as well as\nlived in any large town, except for the lack\nof space and high rents.\nI finally came back to cycling when I\nstarted living with a friend who seemed to\nlive on his bike. Getting my own pair of\nwheels back was revolutionary. No more\nstifling tube in the winter, no more sitting\namongst the grey people peering through\nsteamed up bus windows at grey London\noutside. Instead of frittering away money\non public transport, I started spending on\nthings that I\u2019d own. My bike became an\nextension of myself, something to own\nand care about, the clicks and ticks and\nmechanical whirls as familiar as the throb\nof my heart.\nAll mechanical things break. And I\nhave been truly exasperated when wheels\nhave punctured and bearings seized at the\nworst possible time. But a bike is a simple\na wheeled vehicle as it is possible to imag-ine, and almost anything can be fixed with\na tiny set of tools and a bit of knowledge.\nI honestly think it\u2019s been more reliable\ncommuting on my bike than the tube or\nbus. Cyclists help each other, and working\non bikes is really quite fun, understanding\nand fixing them is a challenge but one that\nanyone is capable of.\nThe speed, to be honest, was a bit of a\nshock. I\u2019m no Lance Armstrong, and it\u2019s\nclear that even buses\ntravel faster than\nyou do on the\nopen straights.\nBut congestion is porous\nwhen you\u2019re\non such a narrow vehicle,\nand lots of back\nroads that are closed\noff or \u2018one wayed\u2019 to\nprevent abuse by cars are\nopen for cyclists. Some even\nhave Toucan crossings to whisk you\nacross the main traffic flows. Racing the\ntube on a long journey is more difficult,\nbut it is surprising how close cut it is.\nCycling around suddenly pooled all the\ndisparate scraps of bits of London I knew\ninto a rich tapestry. I slowly learned routes\nfrom place to place that encompassed\nthe whole of London, a spiders web that\nmeans that no matter where you end up,\npoint me in the direction of Centre Point\n& a few hundreds metres later I\u2019ll recognise where I am and thread my way home.\nWith no opportunity cost of stopping,\nand an infinite number of choices of\nroutes from place to place, discovering\nnew shops, bars and cafes became so\nmuch easier. I realised the wastelands that\nI\u2019d dreaded trudging through were just a\nfew short blocks long, a few minutes of\npeddling and then suddenly you were in\nanother, slightly different, vision of London.\nI used to stumble through the winter\nin a fog of drowsiness, getting chilled on\nthe walks, then roasted in my heavy coat\non public transport. Little light and everything felt submerged in sleep, concentrating in lectures made me feel like I was\ndeep sea diving, struggling against an un-dertow. Now the winter coat stays in the\ncupboard, your body\nputs out so much\nheat cycling that\nyou only need\na thin layer\nfor warmth\nand something\nw i n d p r o o f .\nThe cold air is\nterrifying early\non a winter morn-ing, you drink fire and\nice as you leave the house\nand spin up to speed. But it certainly wakes you up!\nI never meant to exercise. The\nthought of sweating in a gym that reeks\nof other\u2019s exertions fills me with horror.\nI just used my bike to go from place to\nplace. When I wanted to go faster (I was,\nand still am, eternally late for everything)\nor get warmer I would push on the pedals\nharder. But the more I rode, the faster I\u2019d\nhave to go before I got out of breath. I was\nmore hungry than usual, which makes\nfood taste nicer, yet my body just got\nleaner and more toned. Exercise regimes\nare hard to keep to. Commuting regimes\nmuch less so, even if you\u2019re blowing off\ncollege for the day, there\u2019s always places\nto go and people to see. Without ever really intending to, I was suddenly doing an\nhour of exercise a day, with the inevitable\nrepercussions. I first noticed that I\u2019d done\nsomething fairly radical when I was lying\nidle in bed, listening to my watch tick and\nmy heart beat. With some horror, I noticed\nthat the seconds were ticking by faster\nthan the blood was pumping.\nMy favourite cycle journey by far is the\nlate night return from a party. In the sum-mer, this is often in the first light of dawn,\nthe city abandoned by its asleep humans\nbut the buildings bathing the pink glow of\na new sun. The quiet & empty streets are\na joy to ride, a brief and transitory insight\ninto what our city would be like with fewer motor vehicles, the air fresh and soot\nfree before the lorries fire up their filthy\ndiesels. So much of our built environment\nis structured around these inhuman metal\nboxes living on borrowed time and energy\nfrom a prehistoric sun.\nSo please, don\u2019t waste your time like\nme. Get a bike. Ride it. Don\u2019t fear the traf-fic, you will soon gain the confidence to\ncycle amongst it. Do it to get fit, do it to\nreduce your impact on the environment,\nto help construct the city and community\nthat you want to live in, to enjoy the city,\nto be more happy, to meet other people,\nto whizz around a Velodrome, to cut wild\nswathes across the countryside at the\nweekend. It really doesn\u2019t matter. Just get\nsome wheels.\nFat wheels, thin wheels, single speeds,\nhub gears, drop handlebars, dutch bikes,\ncargo bikes, mountain bikes, steel frames\nto carbon fibre Monocoques. Bikes are\namazingly individual. Just find one that\nfits your body, budget and lifestyle and\nenjoy it.\nLove is for Bicycles...\nJarvist Frost\n\u2013 Always lock your bike frame with a decent (high quality D-lock)\nlock to an immoveable object, lock the wheels up with something less hardcore.\n\u2013 Sherfield security sell mega-D-locks for only \u00a328, less than\nhalf price!\n\u2013 Register for the swipe card access parking \u2013 either under the\nfaculty building or behind Huxley, just google \u201cImperial Bike\nParking\u201d.\n\u2013 Learn how to change a flat tyre, you can find this out anywhere\nand all bike shops should happily explain how you should do it.\n\u2013 http://union.ic.ac.uk/presidents/icbug/\nA CHECKLIST FOR BIKE USERS\nAbout 1 billion out of the world\u2019s 7 billion\ninhabitants do not have access to their basic nutritional needs. But what exactly is\nthe problem? Not enough food being pro-duced? Unfair distribution and waste?And\nwhat can we do about it?\nThis is what the teams in the\nThought For Food challenge\nwere keen to answer. After two\nmonths of late-night reading every team came up with a solution to\nbe put in practice at their local level.\nA team decided to run around their campus dressed in chicken costumes to\npromote Meatless Monday. We\nat Imperial, decided to build an\napp, currently being developed,\nthat will help reduce waste from left-overs. Best thing is, all the teams filmed the\nwhole process and presented their solution\nin a 5-minute video, which can be seen on\nThought For Food\u2019s YouTube channel.\nThe challenge will be running again\nthis year, and rumours say it will be going\nglobal. Maybe you want to participate with\nyour Thought For Food?\nFood for thought on Thought For Food\nRodrigo Pracana\nAttheendofthesummer,justas\nterm was about to start again,\nI thought it was about time to\nattempt a new challenge. A few\nyears ago I did the London Marathon for the first time; some\nyears later I did it again, and,\nwanting to raise more money, I\ndid it alongside the Paris Marathon which was two weeks be-fore. This time, wanting to carry\non exponentially up the \u2018slightly\nmental\u2019 ladder, the concept of\ndoing 5 marathons in 5 weeks\ncame and wouldn\u2019t go away.\nThe chance also came to raise\nmoney for The Outward Bound\nTrust, one of the best youth\ndevelopment charities in the\nUK, and I couldn\u2019t resist. They\ngot me the place in the London\nMarathon, and it wasn\u2019t hard\nto find 4 other marathons surrounding it to complete the set.\nIt was soon after embarking on training that I was approached about a totally new\nconcept in sponsorship, and,\nthough I also do need to raise\nmoney, I decided to accept the\nDo Nation challenge and get\npeople to sponsor me by cutting their carbon. There\u2019s no\ncost involved, merely a pledge\nto change something in your\nlife for a while and lessen your\naffect on the environment. The\nways to do this are surprisingly\nsimple \u2013 eat less meat, air dry\nyour clothes, cycle to work, and\nmany more \u2013 all things we hear\nabout all the time but sometimes are just too much effort\nto bother with. The beauty of\nthe Do Nation idea is that by\nsponsoring someone and saying you are going to do some-thing, you have a reason, something to work towards when you\nare trying to save carbon. After\nall, running several marathons\nhas got to be harder than air\ndrying your clothes, right?!\nOf course, I hope people will\nsponsor me not just in carbon\nbut in cash, but there\u2019s no\nreason not to do both. Even if\nyou don\u2019t know anyone who is\ntrying to get sponsorship it\u2019s\nworth searching the site and\nsponsoring someone you don\u2019t\nknow. And if you\u2019re already\npretty green and want to show\nit, why not show off! I\u2019m hopefully going to write something\nmore about this challenge later\nnext year when intense training\nhas begun, but for now please\ncheck out my sponsorship site\nat http://bit.ly/tFIybN and my\nDo Nation site at http://bit.ly/\nsjy2lR\nAlex Kendall\nMarathon Man\nAt least 50 million acres of rainforest are lost every year, totaling an area the size of England, Wales and Scotland combined \u2013 GREEN WEEK 2011\n\n"

Imperial has a long history of success in the\ncompetition, but the Imperial iGEM\nteam managed to break all records this\nyear.\nThe group of nine students took\nhome a series of major prizes from both\nthe European jamboree in Amsterdam,\nwhere they were declared regional\nwinner, and the world championship\nin Boston. Despite the strong competi-tion, Imperial was a proud finalist and\n1st runner up for the final grand prize,\nand won the iGEMers prize as well as\nnumerous other prizes.\nWith their project, the iGEM researchers have tackled the problem of\nworld-wide soil erosion and desertification of drylands. Lacking a stabi-lising and anchoring root system, the\nnutritious soil is highly vulnerable to\nerosive forces, such as rain and wind.\nArable land, on whose cultivation approximately two billion people de-pend, is being successively lost.

This announcement follows\nprevious research by the group, led by\nBen Feringa, into light-driven molecular motors, first reported in 1999.\nMolecular motors use light or other\nstimulation to rotate a hydrocarbon\ngroup around a double bond. After rotation to form an unstable isomer, an exothermic isomerisation process causes\nthe groups to rotate into a more stable\nposition (helix inversion), with the result of movement. This process can be\nrepeated to return to the original con-figuration.\nThis new research involves a molecule designed with four of these motors\nabout a central axis. Electrical pulses\nproduced by the STM excite the mo-tors, and cause it to move across a copper surface; the direction of the pulses\ncan be controlled by the operator of the\nSTM, and so precise control over the\nmovement is possible.\nThe group experienced difficulty in\nmaking all the motors work in tandem\n\u2013 they reported that perfectly straight\nmovement is not possible. However,\ntheir calculations predicted a maximum of 7nm of movement per 10 STM\npulses; with 6nm of movement being\nexperimentally observed, meaning that\nthe \u2018swerving\u2019 of the car is not as a significant problem as could have been.\nThe molecule requires a STM pulse of\n500 millivolts or greater, so imaging the\nmolecule is possible without movement\nby use of a lower voltage. In addition,\nnegative voltages caused no movement.\nThe direction of motion can be controlled by the configuration of the mol-ecule. Depending on the orientation\nof the groups on each side of the axis,\nthe correct isomer can both produce\nforwards movement and no move-ment, depending on the \u2018landing\u2019 of the\nmolecule \u2013 if the molecule is not correctly absorbed in the right orientation,\nmovement is prevented due to the front\n\u2018wheels\u2019 moving in the opposite direction to those at the back. In addition,\nisomers in an incorrect configuration\nproduce haptic movement, due to the\nonside and offside of the \u2018car\u2019 moving\nin alternative directions.\nConditions for the molecular \u2018car\u2019\nprohibit commercial use at present (vac-uum conditions and temperatures of 7K\nwas necessary), however, lead author\nTibor Kudernak told the BBC that this\nwas the next problem to resolve.\nDOI: 10.1038/nature10587\nPhilip Kent\nImperial iGEM success\nNanocars with four-wheel drive\nCyborg yeast is out to get you\nScientists have succeeded in creating\nan artificial feedback loop between\na computer and yeast.

This innovative technique could possibly be\nused in industry to control production\nof biofuel by microbes.\nThe beauty of this technique lies\nin its simplicity, in contrast to the\nincredibly complicated biochemical\npathways it could potentially control.\nPhytochrome, a molecule that detects light, has active and inactive\nforms in red and deep red light re-spectively. Upon becoming active, it\ncan set off gene expression cascades\nto produce a desired protein.\nThe level of gene expression can\nthen be measured through the amount\nof fluorescence a reporter molecule\nemits in the presence of the desired\nprotein\nThe computer, with its algorithmic\nwizardry, analyses the fluorescence.\nOnce a threshold level of protein expression has been reached, deep red\nlight is fired back to the yeast, the\nphytochromes are turned into their\nbiologically inactive forms and the\ncircuit is turned off.\nFeedback control allows for precise\nregulation of these artificial circuits;\nit is an important process already\nutilised by biochemical pathways in\ncells, famously in the krebs cycle and\nin engineering. However, in silico\nfeedback control is the first time science has managed to transcend the\ncommunication barrier between computer and cell.\nThe implications of synthetic circuitry are wide; in silico feedback\ncould be used to create biosensors to\nregulate the level of by-products generated from manipulated metabolic\npathways. It could be utilised within\nbiofuel and small molecule drug production to allow for tight control of\nyield production.\nWhilst it is an exciting step for-ward, it is just a small part of the\ntechnical breakthroughs that will be\nneeded to generate complex synthetic\nbiological circuits.\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.2018\nJula Humphries\nxxx\nThe nanocar in action on a surface of copper...

Unsurprisingly, the most recent\nclash was no different, yet the grit and\ndetermination shown by Imperial was\ntypical of the never say die attitude\nwhich this side has shown over the past\nfew years.\nImperial arrived well ahead of kick\noff and were able to enjoy a relaxed\nand lengthy warm up, despite their\nideal preparation, it was Chichester who\nstruck first. After Imperial put good\npressure on the Chichester scrum within\nthe Imperial 22 meter line, the ball was\nrecycled and Chichester\u2019s full back\ncut between George Lane and Michael\nFloyd in the centre to go through and\nscore, with the conversion added. Going behind so early did not spring Imperial to life but they good pressure deep\nwithin Chichester\u2019s half allowed fly half\nJames Cox to take a penalty opportunity\nand cut the deficit to four points. Although Chichester may not have had the\ntechnical acumen which Imperial pos-sessed, they were using their physical\ngame to good effect around the fringes\nof rucks. Their physical endeavour was\nrewarded with a second try which was\nagain converted. Imperial struggled to\nfind an opening and exasperated coach\nBrimah Kebbie implored them to use\nthe open side to greater effect. After\ngood pressure within the Chichester\nhalf, Imperial were able to use their\ndriven lineout, caught by Chris McGeough, to good effect and come away\nwith five points courtesy of Sean Baker.\nImperial lost full back James Hayward\nbefore halftime to a neck injury but\nwere able to hold out until the break\ntrailing by just six.\nAgain it was Chichester who had the\nupper hand at the outset of the second\nhalf; despite this good work by the front\nrow of James Scaife, Roby Kyle and Simon Fenton had the upper hand in the\nscrums whilst openside Jack Flanagan\nwas constantly committing multiple\ndefenders to bring him down. Imperial scored their second try of the match\nthrough replacement Josh Lowe but\nChichester were not deterred and a long\nrange effort in order to lead 21-13 going\ninto the last twenty minutes.

    "content": "FEATURE\nFeatures Editors: Katy Bettany\nStephen Smith\nfeatures.felix@gmail.com\nFELIX\n6 Friday 18 november 2011\nWhy aren\u2019t we protesting?\nMatthew Colvin reports on what prevents students from taking to the streets\nT\nhe past year has seen student activism reach previously unmatched levels.\nJust over a year since the\nfirst major protest against\nthe Coalition Government\u2019s policies\non higher education, the past week has\nseen another take place on the streets\nof London. Organiser for the National\nCampaign Against Fees and Cuts Michael Chessum has announced a further\nday of action next week on November\n23.\nThese protests have seen vocal support from other universities, yet one\nconstant remains \u2013 a perceived lack of\ninterest from Imperial students. Despite\nthe close proximity of Imperial to the\nheartland of the protests, there has been\nno recent concerted effort to gather students in an effort to join the protestors.\nFelix spoke to students this week\nin order to determine their opinions\ntowards student protests and unravel\nthe reasons behind what could be perceived as campus-wide apathy. What\nemerged from conversations were\nvarying claims covering a wide area of\nImperial life.\nOne of the most popular responses\nstudents gave for a lack of political activity was a large workload. A first year\nEEE student remarked that they had\n\u201ctoo much work to be bothered,\u201d with a\nsecond year biochemistry student referencing \u201cfour deadlines last week\u201d as an\nexample of such assignments.\nIt may have been one of the most\npopular responses from students Felix\nasked but could it really be the case\nthat a perceived higher workload is\nresponsible for a lack of political mo-tivation? Other individuals are keen to\nmake mention of Imperial\u2019s unique position as a science-based institution \u2013 a\nsecond year biochemistry student commented that, \u201cscience is in isolation; it\u2019s\nnot about dealing with relationships.\nPeople do not disagree that something\nis wrong but science is not directly\nabout what happens now.\u201d\nEqually, it is a possibility that political identity has something to do with\nthe decision of students not to protest.\nIt is, of course, wholly irresponsible to\nclass the majority of Imperial students\nunder one entire ideology, but does this\nuniversity lend itself to one particular\nviewpoint? In particular, a viewpoint\nthat encourages uncapped fees in order\nto benefit the university? Rory Fenton\u2019s article (right) attempts to dissect\nthe issue in greater detail.\nFelix contacted Imperial College\nConservative Society in order to gauge\nits opinion on the current political climate amongst students at Imperial,\nsomething the chair describes as \u201cvery\ndifferent from 10 years ago at Imperial, where nearly everyone I knew was\nout en force for the protest against the\ninvasion of Iraq.\u201d When asked as to\nthe reason behind Imperial\u2019s comparative political inactivity today, the chair\nnoted a number of potential reasons,\nincluding an \u201cintense\u201d workload, \u201capathy along the lines of \u2018I can\u2019t make\u2019 a\ndifference\u2019\u201d and Imperial\u2019s location in\nCentral London, claiming that \u201cImperial students would rather be doing\nsomething that is more exciting.\u201d\n\u201cThere are a whole host of reasons\nin my humble opinion, but I believe\nraising awareness is fundamental so at\nleast there is an informed choice to be\nactive or not.\u201d\nYet Imperial students have stood together en masse in protest for a joint\ncause \u2013 not in Central London, but at\nlast December\u2019s Life Science Protests.\nFollowing the announcement of staff\nredundancies and departmental restructure in the Department of Life Sciences late last year, over 1000 students\nsigned a petition against the proposed\nchanges. Alongside this, students took\nto protesting outside a Senate meeting.\nFelix spoke to one of the organisers\nbehind the protests, Dan Wan, then a\nthird year biologist, to determine what\nset this protest apart from others in\nterms of attracting support from Imperial.\n\u201cI think when something as emotional as this hits this close to home, people\nstart to take a stand. Personally, I just\nfelt that I owed to it to the lecturers who\nhad taught and were teaching me at the\ntime. These lecturers had invested so\nmuch time in teaching, coaching and interacting with students, bringing us up\nfrom freshers to graduates. We all got\nto know them not just as teachers, but\nas people. The manner in which these\npeople we respected and admired were\nbeing sacked was completely atrocious.\nI guess someone had to stand up and\nshow the College how badly they were\nhanding the entire situation.\u201d\nAsking whether Imperial would\nbenefit from a more politically active\nand aware student body, Wan believes\nthat, \u201cas a student body, Imperial likes\nto keep themselves to themselves. In\nsome ways, it can be healthy that Imperial students rather concentrate on the\nmatters that directly affect themselves,\nsuch as the Life Sciences Protests.\u201d\nWhen asked why it is that national\nevents do not command the same\namount of attention from Imperial\nstudents, Wan concedes that this \u201cis\nsomething I have always struggle to\nunderstand. I don\u2019t think it is a lack of\nopinion, you can see that through just\ntalking to people around campus. However, I don\u2019t think it is apathy either.\nThere is a lack of encouragement to do\nso, possibly.\n\u201cMaybe the political views are just\ntoo varied, and the Union can\u2019t easily\npinpoint some and support those. Maybe the Union and its involved students\nare too wrapped in internal politics to\nreally notice what\u2019s going on beyond\nBeit Quad to an extent where they\nwould join a protest en-masse. I\u2019m really not sure. I don\u2019t particularly think\nit is the Union\u2019s fault, either. I know\nthey have done plenty to support and\noppose national political proposals in\nthe past. Look at the Browne Report,\nthe President that year was actively\ninvolved in consultation with Lord\nBrowne himself.\u201d\nUnlike other student unions across\nthe country, Imperial College Union refuses to break ultra vires, or act outside\nof its constitution. Actively supporting\nthe protests, as sabbatical officers from\nother UK universities have done, would\nbe an example of this. Felix spoke to\nUnion President Scott Heath and Deputy President (Education) Jason Parmar\nto discuss their views on the situation.\nHeath \u2013 supporting the view that being\nat a science-focused university lends\nitself to students focusing on their degrees and future careers \u2013 is keen to\nstress that the sight of students from\nother universities protesting is not indicative of the feelings of Imperial\nstudents: \u201cWe may see counterparts at\nUCL and LSE leading their students\non protests but that doesn\u2019t mean their\nentire student body is more caring than\nours about political issues.\u201d\n\u201cInstead of fighting the College about\nits stance of the \u00a39k fee, the Union\nworked with it to ensure students are\nmore financially supported when coming to Imperial next year. Student will\nhave more support than they get under\nthe current \u00a33k fee system. Instead of\nspending hours promoting marches, we\nare championing the ideas we raised in\nthe NSS response that will directly affect our members and will reap greater\nbenefits for the students of tomorrow.\u201d\nParmar, conversely, supports the\nview that \u201cit is the political stance of\nthe students as a whole,\u201d alongside a\nhigher workload: \u201cThe majority (but of\ncourse not all) of our students tend to\nfocus on their degrees and involvement\nwith societies. Our students can often\nfeel like they\u2019re over-worked and don\u2019t\nfeel like they have time to campaign on\npolitical issues.\u201d\nIn terms of actual activism, it is clear\nthat this university is unique. Ultimately, the fact that this institution finds itself in such a science-focused position\nwill allow the debate surrounding student protests to continue for now \u2013 behind closed doors.\nTommy Allieri\nLast Wednesday\u2019s protests attracted thousands of students from across the country\nWhen you visit a pharmacist, a quarter of all purchases will have come from a tropical rainforest \u2013 GREEN WEEK 2011\n\n"

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editor: Eva Rosenthal\nWill Prince\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe lights dimmed, an enigmatic black cube\nbegan to descend from the ceiling, and a voice\nwhispered unsettlingly, \u201cYou know when\nyou\u2019re in that deep sleep\u2026\u201d At this point, the\nproduction Felix saw suddenly halted \u2013 a technical glitch we were told that would be swiftly\nresolved. Whilst the superstitious amongst us\nwould have us believe that something like this\nwas inevitable, given the name of the National\nTheatre\u2019s new play 13, once restarted the play\nrarely faltered, and proved hypnotising through-out. Playwright Mike Bartlett\u2019s newest endeavour is an ambitious one, at once attempting to\ninterweave social commentary with real human\ndrama, profound philosophising with blockbuster staging, whilst all the while trying to hold\nit together with a narrative that actually makes\nsense. And against all the odds, it largely suc-ceeds.\nIn a parallel but all too familiar London, people from all walks of life have been having the\nsame nightmare \u2013 one with monsters, chaos and\nexplosions. They can\u2019t sleep. In this atmosphere\nof unrest and disquiet director Thea Sharrock introduces us to a slew of characters that paint the\npicture of a deeply unhappy London. \u2018Britain\u2019s\nugly\u2019 quips an American child as she visits for\nthe first time, a sentiment echoed by its inhabitants throughout the play. But the discontent isn\u2019t\nlimited to our four shores \u2013 Iran\u2019s the same, and\nelements in Westminster and Washington quite\nfancy a war there- apparently afraid of the prospect of a nuclear armed Tehran. In the midst of\na public that is largely \u2018unemployed and pissed\noff,\u2019(not to mention \u2013 very sleep deprived) there\ncomes an unassuming people\u2019s prophet: \u2018John\nin the Park.\u2019 As the play progresses we watch\nto see whether this generation really can affect\na change, or whether they\u2019ll once again resign\nthemselves to the will of the controlling powers.\nThough occasionally teetering on juggling too\nmany character arcs, the play is by and large\nquite engaging \u2013 aided by seamless transitions,\nshort and snappy scenes, and a rather unique set.\nSaid \u2018set\u2019 is really just a massive black box that\nrotates according to the setting \u2013 bringing new\ncharacters on and off in a silent whirl, and giving a contextual but sparse backdrop to scenes\nthat demand it. It is never overbearing nor gim-micky, but serves to streamline what is actually\nquite a long play at two and a half hours. However the play only rarely drags with fast paced\nset pieces like the club-dance number, and the\nrather hilarious rendition of Rihanna\u2019s \u2018Only\nGirl in the World.\u2019 The acting too is universally\ngood, with perhaps one exception, that of Kirsty\nBushell\u2019s rather pre-emptive \u2018Rachel\u2019. Instead\nof acting well, she decided to spend her time\nonstage experimenting with \u2018inTEReSTIng\u2019\nintonation. The standout performer however\nwas Adam James; at once effortlessly convinc-ing, utterly compelling and genuinely moving \u2013\neven without a sympathetic role. This is an actor\nat the top of his game.\nThe play is not flawless though. Since it\nserves both as a character-based drama, and a\nphilosophically-minded social commentator, it\ncannot fulfil either role to its utmost. As well as\nthis there are characters who, whilst well acted\nand entertaining don\u2019t really add to the narrative in any meaningful way. But in a sense its\n\u2018weaknesses\u2019 are also its greatest strengths. The\nsurplus of characters ensure that the play never\nbecomes humourless, and with disarmingly\nfrank discussions on God and religion, it is inevitably far more thought provoking than the\naverage drama, whilst giving a human heart to\nwell reasoned discussions. The real danger lay\nin the possibility that it would become preachy\nand moralising, especially in the second half,\nwhich was largely a debate between two opposing ideologies. But the two viewpoints are\nso well represented that one can\u2019t really fault it,\nas well as helpfully delivered by characters that\nyou actually believe in.

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 18 november 2011 19\nWe\u2019re not going to patronise you by saying that the views expressed are\nthe opinions of the authors, not Felix. Oh, wait, we are. Ooops.\n\u201d\nT\nhe fact that I\u2019m still alive is\nsurprising to say the least.\nEvery day, my life is a\nconstant struggle against\nthe innumerable dangers\nthat surround me. Some are obvious;\ncycling to college focuses the sum hatred of all commuters on my little two\nwheels. My home is no safer; I actually\npay for deadly substances like electricity and gas to be pumped through into\nmy living space. At night, I sleep with\na blanket and pillows. How I haven\u2019t\nsmothered myself is a mystery.\nBut of all these dangers, there are two\nI am especially wary of. These nemeses\nare all the more dangerous because they\nare so often overlooked. They are commonly encountered by most people every day, in some shape or form. Most\ndon\u2019t pay them a second thought but\nI pay them third and fourth thoughts.\nEven fifth thoughts when I\u2019m feeling\nparticularly paranoid. Knowing of the\nthreat they pose is one way of protecting myself against them.\nI\u2019m talking about cats and babies.\nDon\u2019t laugh.\nIt is a criminal offence to carry a knife\nbut there is no such crime for carrying\na cat, despite having more than a dozen\ntimes the number of blades. I have personal evidence that a cat\u2019s claws can\npenetrate denim, corduroy, lead and\nhuman skin \u2013 in that order. Just as an\noffensive weapon cats are dangerous,\nbut it is coupled with a cold and most\nsupreme intelligence. The most benign\nexpression I have ever read in a cat is\nCharles Betts\nRhys Davies\nCalm down dear, it\u2019s only an opinion!\nCats and babies\none of weary tolerance. Cats are more\nthan capable of taking over the world.\nThe only reason that they don\u2019t is that\nthey would have to feed themselves\nafterwards, which would be the most\ntremendous bother. But conspiring to\nruin my life and/or corduroy trousers is\nchild\u2019s play for them.\nBabies are even worse because they\nare even more innocuous. They just lie\nthere all day, laughing and crying, eating and pooping. Not an obvious danger\nto anyone, providing they\u2019re wearing\nnose-clips at all times. They don\u2019t even\nseem to have the same otherworldly intelligence of cats \u2013 or do they? We talk\nnonsense to babies and suppose that\nthey have all the smarts of a steamed\npumpkin. I think these biases colour\nour views. Ask a baby about the missing\nworks of Shakespeare or the Riemann\nhypothesis or string theory and you may\nbe treated to some very sagely stares.\nBut sadly we don\u2019t \u2013 instead, we dangle\nour keys in front of them.\nThis constant underestimation combined with a child-like image of justice\ncan lead babies to be pretty vindictive.\nYou make choo-choo sounds with a\nspoonful of mushy peas; the only fair\nretaliation is to vomit over the back of\nyour fancy evening dress. If you happen\nto be wearing it at the time, that is just\nicing on the karmic cake.\nA house with both a cat and baby is\nwhere angels fear to tread. Cold intelligence and tempered, pure, diapered\nvengeance is a match made in the darkest bowels of hell. There is nothing a cat\nS\nilvio Berlusconi has proved\nhimself a great salesman\nand a poor statesman.\nSounds good, doesn\u2019t it?\nHas a certain panache. The\nonly thing is, I didn\u2019t come up with\nit. The succinct, elegant sentence was\nwritten by Beppe Severgnini, the reputable Italian political commentator,\nin a recent Financial Times column.\nMy opinions on Berlusconi\u2019s reign\nas Prime Minister of the eurozone\u2019s\nthird largest economy are limited to\nwhat I have read in national media; I\nhave never met an Italian politician, let\nalone voted in an Italian election. And\nherein lies the problem with student\nopinion pieces: they cannot be more\nthan a regurgitation of other, profes-sional, columnist\u2019s original thoughts.\nA newspaper\u2019s prime objective is\nto inform the reader. It is fair to ask\nhow this can achieved by voicing the\nopinions of students whose best source\nof information is Question Time and\nNewsnight. Arguably, the News section of Felix is the best place where\nthe reader can find unique, researched\njournalism in this publication. Unlike\nNick Robinson or Simon Jenkins, student columnists don\u2019t lunch with top\nbrass politicians, patiently digging for\nthe truth behind the headlines.\nYet, unlike national media, Felix\u2019s\nkey purpose is to act as a hub for students to express their creativity. At a\npredominately science-based univer-sity, Felix holds a unique role in providing a much needed artistic outlet\nand puts to bed the misconception that\nImperial students are all geeky, singularly focused boffins. The News section is there to inform the reader, both\nstudents and staff, of college events\nin a similar vein to local town news-papers. The Comment section of Felix\nis debatably a more selfish place where\nstudents get to indulge in forming, at\ntimes ill-constructed (much like this\npiece), rationalised opinions on, pri-marily, current affairs.\nThis paper has, over recent weeks,\npublished many articles on religion.\nIt\u2019s encouraging to see that students\ntake a keen interest in the issues, but\nif I want to form my own view on the\nsubject I will read Dawkins\u2019 infamous\nbook and speak to the College Chaplain personally. The same goes for the\nJeremy Kyle debate; if I want to make\na judgment, I\u2019ll watch the show for\nmyself. And, more recently, if I wish\nto form an opinion on the Occupy Lonand a baby cannot do and heaven help\nyou if you have crossed them. For this\nreason, not only do I lock my doors at\nnight \u2013 I also lock the cat-flap.\nWhat terrifies me most is not cats and\nbabies themselves \u2013 though awful in\ndon movement, I\u2019m better off going to\nSt Paul\u2019s than reading an atrociously\nformed argument in Felix. In short, I\u2019ll\nresort to more robust, better-informed\noutlets.\nAs a result, if I disagree with someone\u2019s opinion in this paper, I am likely\nto turn a blind eye and move on. Nobody likes to be demonised by their\npeers for something they have writ-ten, especially when one has often\nmeant the tone to be light hearted. Any\nsingle Comment piece in Felix merely\nreflects the thoughts of one student,\nsome you\u2019ll agree with and others you\nwon\u2019t; each has been written to enter-tain. Each has also been founded on\nincomplete subject knowledge, and as\nsuch should be taken, as per Mr Berlusconi\u2019s self-confessed sexual prowess,\nwith a pinch of salt.\nI have personal\nevidence that a cat\u2019s\nclaws can penetrate\ndenim, corduroy,\nlead and human\nskin \u2013 in that order.\n\u201c\nI have p\nI have\nevidenc\nevidenc\ntheir own right \u2013 but what they can be-come. Cats are only ten minutes down\nthe road genetically, or two missed\nmeals, away from the leopard, the most\ndeadly of predators. And babies?\nWe all know what they grow up into.\nThis is terrifying. Look at that yarn ball. Creepy\n\u201d\nFelix\u2019s key purpose\nis to act as a hub for\nstudents to express\ntheir creativity.\n\u201c\nFelix\u2019s k\nFelix\u2019s k\nis to ac\nis to ac\nFelix\u2019s Deputy Editor on the perils of the Comment section\nLizzy Griffiths\n\n"

Approximately 15\npeople in total attended. The purpose of\nthe training was to assist in the development of leadership skills amongst newly\nformed clinical management teams.\n\u201cImperial College Healthcare NHS\nTrust (ICHT) commissioned leadership\nand development services from Coalescence Consulting in line with normal\nprocesses prior to the appointment of\nMark Davies as interim Chief Executive\nin May.\n\u201cPrior to his arrival at ICHT, Mark\nDavies resigned as a director of the com-pany.

He\nspoke on Free software, and the rights\nof us all as users of software, and in the process\nhe brought something to my attention.\nA term is being increasingly used in the me-dia, one which is taken by most to have a positive connotation. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all heard it\nbefore \u2013 \u2018Open Source\u2019. Open Source means\nsimply that the code is available for anyone\nto view if they so wish, and then compile\nthemselves if they don\u2019t want to use the package normally provided to them. Whilst this is\nindeed a good thing, it is often taken by the\nmedia to mean much more than it actually is.\nWhat the media often imply it means is\n\u2018Free\u2019, used in a context more akin to \u2018freedom\u2019, a concept coined by Richard Stallman\nin the 80s. A commonly quoted description is\n\u201cFree as in speech, not free as in beer\u201d, and\nto this extent, it is sometimes instead called\n\u201cLibre\u201d (for example, the free office suite LibreOffice) to try and avoid the confusion. It is\non this that Stallman spoke.\nMaking the choice\nFree software has an altogether different\nmeaning, and is much more about morality\nthan open source is. There are four freedoms\nlisted by the Free Software Foundation as fundamental to free software.\nFree software often (nearly always) overlaps with Open Source but the two are not the\nsame thing, and this is something that, in my\nexperience, few people realise. In short, Free\nsoftware was created due to moral reason-ing, it\u2019s about people having power over their\nown computing and being able to decide how\nto use their own computers, whereas Open\nSource is the development technique that\ncame from this. Open Source software (like\nChromium, amongst others) is not necessarily\nfree software, as free software insists on the\nfour fundamental freedoms listed above and\nOpen Source proponents don\u2019t always agree\nwith these freedoms. However, all free software (such as the GIMP) is by definition also\nopen source, as this is necessary for freedom.\nWhy it matters\nSo why should you care about this? There\nare numerous reasons to avoid any non-free\n(proprietary) software (including backdoors\nallowing the writer to control your comput-er, large and unwieldy programs using more\nmemory, and of course, more bugs, to name\njust a few), but in practice completely avoiding proprietary software is impossible.\nThere are two main reasons that it\u2019s important for you to know the difference, and why\nit\u2019s important to care.\nFirstly, individuals should be aware not only\nof the dangers of trusting proprietary software,\nbut also of the fact that Open Source software\ndoes not always remove these dangers to the\nsame extent that Free software does.\nSecondly, there has been a thought process\nprevalent in software companies over the past\nfew years. \u201cIf it fails, open source it and claim\nthat you\u2019re giving back to the community\u201d,\ntrying to gain good rep by \u2018giving\u2019 their failed\nprojects to the community. Many people fall\nfor this, believing that Open Source is inherently a good thing, but this is simply not the\ncase. In actual fact, these programs are often\ngiven very restrictive licenses, and/or rely on\nthe community to clean it up so that it can become a useful program. Free software licences\nforce companies who donate software to the\ncommunity to actually give the software up\nwhen they donate it, thus allowing it to truly\nbecome community owned.\nSo, in short, Free software conforms to the\nfour fundamental freedoms, but Open Source\nsimply conforms to freedom 1. Free software\ngives you, the user, freedom, but Open Source\ndoes not.\nFree software everyday?\nHow much should this matter to you? Finding\ntruly Free software, for a variety of reasons,\nis a lot more difficult than you would hope,\nso it might not be wise to depend on it. Yet if\nyou get the chance, supporting and using Free\nsoftware is definitely the way to go.\nHuman-machine interfaces till now have largely\ndepended upon humans telling machines how to\nbehave, to help us achieve our goals. Now, work at\nthe Montpellier Laboratory of Informatics, Robotics and Microelectronics has shown that things\ncan work the other way around, with a robot controlling the movements of a human arm using\nelectrodes attached to the arm. Given the goal of\ndropping a ball into the net and a human carrying\na ball, the robot can apply electrical impulses to\nthe arm that swivel it to the required position. The\nrobot then generates a short pulse that releases\nthe muscles in the hand and causes the ball to\ndrop into the net. While it\u2019s not entirely clear what\nthe applications of this ability are, it\u2019s hoped that\nthe robot might assist in hospitals with patient\nrehabilitation. When used regularly by a person\nwith limited limb movements, the system should\nre-familiarise the body to regular motion.\nA long drawn out legislative battle is looming in\nAmerica, with media houses and Senators pushing\nforward a draconian new copyright law that redefines\nthe responsibilities of content providers and users\nin adhering to copyright law. In simpler English, this\nmeans that websites such as YouTube and Vimeo\nwould be reponsible for ensuring that copyrighted\ncontent wasn\u2019t stored on their servers.\nThe implications of this would be huge, as it would\nprobably mean the end of content-sharing as we now\nknow it. Given the volume of data uploaded to YouTube (35 hours/minute in late 2010), the cost of exhaustively monitoring uploaded content will probably\nprove prohibitive for most video hosting providers.\nThe law has naturally been met with vocal opposition from a coalition of leading technology firms: in\na rare show of unity, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Aol,\nEbay, LinkedIn and Yahoo have published a public\nletter to the Senate expressing concern about the\n\u2018serious risk\u2019 to innovation and job creation within\nthe industry. Another key provision of the bill would\nmake unauthorized streaming a felony.\nWhatever the final outcome of the American policy\ndebate, there\u2019s bound to be an impact on British\ncopyright law in the near future. Preserving our right\nto keep our data private and pushing for fairer copyright solutions is vital.\nSanchit Sharma on why \u2018Free\u2019 is more than you expect\nThe four freedoms of\nFree software\nFreedom 0:\nThe freedom to run the program, for\nany purpose\nFreedom 1:\nThe freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does\nyour computing as you wish.

But,\nand this is a pretty big \u2018but\u2019, if you stuck those\nfrankly awful lyrics that I just wrote together with\nA$AP\u2019s cheeky intonations and Clams Casino\u2019s\nbass-heavy, weed-ready production you might just\nfind yourself saying, \u201cThis shit is fucking real\u201d. (Ok,\nmaybe not quite, but you get my point).\nIgnore what he\u2019s saying and just hear how it\nsounds and you\u2019ll understand why some people\nare saying that A$AP Rocky is what hip-hop will\nsound like in 2012.\nIf you agree that my mini-rap was god-awful, tweet\nme @kadhimshubber and call me a \u201cfucking codpiece\u201d. If, on the other hand, you think it was pretty\ngood, tweet @_ASAProcky and tell him to check out\n\u201cthis sweet underground rapper from London\u201d.\nKadhim Shubber reports from KABLAAM\nReports from a sick night\nin Metric... no, seriously\nD\non\u2019t let anyone convince you to\nput on a music event. It\u2019ll stress\nyou out, distract you from your\ndegree, and worst of all, when\nit comes off, the feeling of satisfaction will make you forget all the shit and\nmake you think about doing it all again.\nLast Saturday was KABLAAM, the first Felix\nMusic Night of the year. The idea of bringing\nFelix, Jazz & Rock and Music Tech together\nto take advantage of Metric\u2019s uber-expensive\nsound system was concocted by Imperial graduate Greg Power, last year. When he left, he\nlooked in me in the eye and said, \u201cKadhim, you\nmust now carry the flame. Bring music to the\npeople.\u201d (Ok, he may not have used those exact words, but you get the jist). What he didn\u2019t\nsay, however, is, \u201cKadhim, you\u2019ll be so worried\nabout the night being a total flop that your balls\nare going to crawl back up inside you and start\npunching you in the gut\u201d.\nWhich brings us to around 7:30 on Saturday\nnight. lo. batt. / algo ritmico is still sound\nchecking even though SMB was meant to have\nstarted DJing 30 minutes ago (algo ritmico is\ndragging on so much I\u2019m beginning to suspect\nthat he\u2019s just playing his set. Oh god, he is\u2026)\nI\u2019m already three beers and one straight spiced\nrum down and only about 30 people have\nshown up; I\u2019m going to need another beer.\nI head to the door to check ticket sales: 35\npeople\u2026 I walk back into Metric. It\u2019s almost\n8pm and SMB has finally got started. He\u2019s\nplaying chilled out, groovy house music. He\u2019s\nobscenely good but people are avoiding the\ndance floor like Greeks avoid taxes. This is going to change: I drag a friend onto the dancefloor and start chatting to her, casually dancing.\nSet an example, I tell myself, everyone else\nwill follow\u2026 This isn\u2019t working, I walk back\nout of Metric, I\u2019m just walking around for the\nsake of it at this point; I\u2019m going to need another beer.\n8:20pm. lo. batt. / algo ritmico is back on\nstage for his set. There\u2019s a bit of a crowd now,\nok, cool. Is that his mum filming? \u2026 His music\nis dreamy and spaced out in a completely surreal way. Kind of like listening to alien beeps\ncoming from outer space. He\u2019s got a laptop, a\nguitar, a delay pedal and... an ironing board?\nI\u2019m going to need another beer.\nAbout half an hour later, Black Sands are on\nstage; we\u2019re back on schedule. I relax a little\nbit; well, either I\u2019m relaxing or I\u2019m too drunk\nto care any more. Oh shit, I have to go introduce them. I\u2019ve got no idea what to say and end\nup doing a boxing announcer-style, \u201cBLACK.\nSAAAAAAANDS!\u201d People cheer, ok that\ndidn\u2019t go too badly. There\u2019s a decent number\nof people dancing along to them. They play\npretty straightforward indie music but they do\nit bloody well.\nI ask the lovely chaps on the door what our\nticket sales are like. We\u2019re edging slowly towards 100. We\u2019re out of disaster territory but\nfor the whole of his 45 minute set, he\u2019s got the\ncrowd dancing and bouncing. I ask the chaps at\nthe door to count the takings and see how many\npeople have turned up; it\u2019s around 200.\nThe rest of the night was a bit of a blur.\nMonsk and Niceberg DJed out the night until\n1am, but I was a bit far gone and forgot to introduce them (sorry guys!) Looking back at the\nphotos, I realised that Mikill Pane had posed\nfor photos with a big crowd of people; respect\nfor that. As everyone filtered out at 1am, and\nwe sorted out the money and concluded that it\nhad been a success, lo. batt. /algo ritmico (a.k.a\n\u00cd\u00f1igo the Felix Music Editor) comes up to me\nand says, \u201cCool, shall we start organizing the\nnext one?\u201d\nI just want to say thanks to all the acts who performed and to Will, Chrissy, \u00cd\u00f1igo, Greg, Luke,\nand Deepka for their help organising the night.\nnot quite into success territory yet.\nOperation Midnight Climax up next. I clamber on stage again and, in addition to my boxing\nannouncer-style, \u201cOPERATION MIDNIGHT\nCLIMAAAAAAAX\u201d, I also crack a few jokes;\nI think I heard a bit of laughter, but it may just be\nthe beer. They turn up the rock a few notches and\nblow a few minds with their cover of t.A.T.u.\n\u2018All the Things She Said\u2019. It\u2019s getting towards\nten and the headliner Mikill Pane should be\narriving soon. Metric is rapidly filling up and\nthough the guys at the door have lost count, they\nreckon there are another 30/40 people now.\nWhen Mikill Pane arrives at the union I go\ninto full-blown happy butler mode. \u201cHi there,\nhow you doing? Yep come this way, certainly,\nok, cool. Yep a couple of drinks, ok, one second\n\u2026 *sprint to the bar *sprint back with drinks\n\u2026 here you go.\u201d He\u2019s at least 6ft 4 and towers\nover me, and he\u2019s got an entourage \u2013 I wish I\nhad an entourage \u2013 including a Pete Doherty\nlookalike with little brown hat with a huge\nwide brim.\nOperation Midnight Climax finish their set.\nThe equipment is cleared away and for about\n40 minutes the plug for the mixer screws with\nthe sound and I\u2019m running back and forth\napologizing for the delay; several more beers\nfollow.\nBut finally, I get on stage to announce Mikill\nPane. I can see people streaming through the\ndoor as I speak and Metric\u2019s looking pretty\npacked now. I retreat to the bar and when\nMikill Pane gets on the mic, everyone cheers\nand my balls finally stop punching me in the\ngut. His DJ is mashing together classic hiphop dancefloor tunes to get everyone warmed\nup; everyone\u2019s getting down so it seems to be\nworking. Mikill Pane knows how to work the\ncrowd. He\u2019s got everyone chanting \u201cFUCK!\u201d\nin time with the music every few rhymes and\nMusic Editors: \u00cd\u00f1igo Martinez de Rituerto\nStephen Smith\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nBe sure not to miss...\nNever has the analogue synthesizer produced such\nsoul-rippling and heart-wrenching sounds.

    "content": "so thrilled. I watched with glee as you developed\nmonsters, crafting, day and night cycles, so much\nmore!\nYou were quickly becoming what we all want-GAMES\nGames Editor: Laurence Pope\nGrow beard; Kill dragons\nDouglas Heaven on The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and incredible manliness\nS\nkyrim is a foreign country: they do\nthings differently there. I\u2019ve been trekking its sunny snow-packed hills and\nalpine meadows for seven days now,\nbut apart from an incredible beard I\u2019ve\nlittle to show for it. I know I ought to be more de-pendable; I know there\u2019s a lot at stake. I know that\ndragons have suddenly returned to the world, and\nI know that, as one of the Dragonborn, it\u2019ll probably turn out to be my problem. But with so many\nrabbits to chase, flowers to pick and butterflies to\neat I\u2019m finding it hard to concentrate on any of the\nmany tasks at hand.\nIt went wrong from the start. I emerged into the\nvast open world with a companion who bid me join\nhim in the next town \u2013 there was a main quest to\nbe played. But this is an Elder Scrolls game, and\nthere\u2019s side-quest gold to be found in them hills. I\nwaited until my companion turned a corner in the\nroad and then I ran in the opposite direction.\nI\u2019ve found adventure and moderate riches, but\nno glory \u2013 not yet anyway. I came upon an abandoned fort in the mountains and rid it of skeletons.\nBut its current owner turned out to be a vampire\nmaster who refused to fall over even after a dozen\nreloads \u2013 I ran away. I made friends with a were-wolf, delivered a love letter, stole vegetables from\nthe shelves of a shop and sold them back to the\nshopkeeper. I bought a fat horse who occasionally\ndisappears when I\u2019m riding it, killed twenty bandits and ran away from a bandit thug.\nI met a bard crossing a plain one night and paid\nhim twenty-five gold pieces to stand and sing for\nme; he was still singing when he went out of ear-shot. I walked alongside a mute giant for a mile\nor more, but I\u2019m not sure he knew I was there.\nI\u2019ve become pretty good at picking locks but not\nat sneaking, which has left me in several embarrassing situations in other people\u2019s houses late at\nnight. I\u2019ve seen mammoths, sabre-toothed tigers\nand bears and run away from all of them.\nI don\u2019t know what came over me when I finally\narrived at my original companion\u2019s village. I saw\na chicken scratching in the street in front of me,\ntook out my bow and shot it. As it flopped over\nsideways, a woman ran at me, shouting, \u201cThat\u2019s\na valuable animal!\u201d She was followed by the entire village, who came at me with axes and sticks.\nWhen I reloaded I gave that chicken a wide berth.\nAfter a while I acquired a servant of sorts \u2013 a\nhouse carl, though I\u2019m a long way from having a\nhouse \u2013 who diligently carries my heavier items\nand picks off mudcrabs I can\u2019t be bothered with.\nShe\u2019s obedient but violent: she\u2019ll pick up anything\nI tell her to and sit where I point, but when it comes\nto my horse the only thing she\u2019s willing to do is\nattack it.\nBut you probably want to know about the drag-ons. Bethesda\u2019s announcement a year ago that The\nElder Scrolls V: Skyrim would feature dragons\nset the tone for the marketing hype that followed.\nWe\u2019re not talking some dragons, either, but unlimited dragons, randomly encountered, flapping out\nof the sky with a scream and a shadow. However,\nother than during a couple of scripted introductory\nencounters, I\u2019ve so far seen only one. It was a long\nway off, minding its own business, majestically\ncircling a cold grey peak; I turned and ran back the\nway I\u2019d come.\nRunning is such a simple joy in this game. The\nworld in Oblivion, Skyrim\u2019s predecessor, was undoubtedly beautiful, but ultimately bland and soul-less. The astonishing detail is there again \u2013 maybe\nyou\u2019ll only notice that daytime shadows move with\nthe sun or that the stars edge across the night sky if\nyou put the controller aside and let the game idle for\na bit \u2013 but Skyrim feels more fully realised, more\nvaried \u2013 you get the impression that each vignette\nof water-splashed rocks or shade-dappled spinney\nhave been shaped by artists\u2019 hands and not procedural generation alone. And it\u2019s not just the land-scape: this time the people have more than three\nvoices to share between them and background conversations are less inane. Everyone\u2019s also a lot less\nugly \u2013 except for elves, who for some reason now\nall look like angry aliens.\nThere\u2019s also a lot more to your interactions with\nthe world: crafting now encompasses tanning,\nsmithing and cooking, as well as enchanting and\nalchemy. Fighting has been made more strategic\nwith the option to wield what you like in either\nhand, be it weapon, shield or spell. And you can\nshout at things. Shouts are learned from defeated\ndragons \u2013 I\u2019ve just learnt my first one and it seems\nmost effective at mildly stunning my horse. A piece\nof loading-screen lore, however, has informed me\nthat a king of Skyrim was once \u201cshouted to pieces\u201d.\nLevelling up appears to work in much the same\nway as it did in Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas, with each level giving you a point to spend\non perks. But it\u2019s easy to forget about the levelling \u2013 none of these Bethesda games are RPGs in\nthe traditional sense, like Baldur\u2019s Gate, say, or\neven Dragon Age. Let\u2019s instead call them action\nRPGs, or choose-your-own FPSs, or FPSs-withconversations.\nHappy birthday, Minecraft, my sweetling. You\u2019ve\nbeen like my own child all these years, but you\u2019re\nall grown-up now, your features well formed and\nbug-free; yet you\u2019re worth only a modest \u20ac20. It\nwasn\u2019t always this way, you know. Oh yes \u2013 I remember before you were born.\nSpring, 2009, what a fine season that was. I remember playing with Notch, your father, on the\ngame Infiniminer, with its 3D world made up of\ncubes, all of us playing together, mining and building blocks. Sound familiar? \u201cOh, it has Infiniminer\u2019s look,\u201d we cooed when you were born, and \u201cit\u2019s\nlike a 3D Dwarf Fortress!\u201d Back then you were a\nsimple, precious thing: your grass all one colour,\nalways sunny, so few block types.\nYou\u2019ve been told this time and time before, I bet,\nbut you really are quite like Lego. At least, back\nthen you were: you\u2019ve definitely matured since\nthen (and are doing so much better for it). When\nwe first heard about your \u2018survival\u2019 mode, we were\ned: creative, yet challenging; stimulating, satisfy-ing, and sometimes scary. When you grew infinite\nworlds, I saw that your father had something to be\ntruly proud of. That\u2019s when I handed over my mon-An ode to the beauty of Minecraft\nKeir Little ey, to make sure he\u2019d raise you well. Of course,\nyou were worth only \u20ac10 back then.\nYou grew so quickly over the next year, and I\nwas with you every step of the way. You flourished,\ntaunting me over exam time, rewarding me during\nboring summer days. You stretched my creativity,\nmy spirit for adventure, and together we explored\ndeep, dark caves for their treasures, and made\nbeautiful creations.\nI was so happy for you last year when you got to\nyour beta stage. You earned so many new friends\nthen! But you began to grow away from me. So\nmany new features, and it became hard to keep up:\nI felt like an old man bewildered by a computer\nwhen you showed me your redstone, yet your new\npals raced ahead with using it.\nI know I\u2019ve not had much time for you recently,\nMinecraft, and I\u2019ve not been staying up-to-date\nwith everything you wanted to show me, but you\u2019ll\nalways have a place in my heart. Happy birthday,\nMinecraft, and here\u2019s to many years of exploring\nall that you\u2019ve got to offer.\nNew research has shown that dragons make everything 110% more badass\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nRolling hills and sweeping valleys compose\nthe pristine landscape A time to forgive and forget\nFELIX\n38 Friday 18 november 2011\nEvery day 40,000 children die from preventable diseases \u2013 GREEN WEEK 2011\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 18 november 2011 37\nGAMES\n\u2018Cringe-inducing football\npun goes here\u2019\nSimon Carnochan kicks about some of his thoughts on Sports Interactive\u2019s latest\nproduct, Football Manager 2012\nF\nootball Manager, undeniably the best\nfootball management game on Earth,\nis back again. My addictive relationship with the game began at the tender\nage of seven and I\u2019ve been hooked ever\nsince, even turning up fifteen minutes late to my\nGCSE Religious Studies exam due to an FA Cup\nsemi-final with Hull running into extra-time. Anyone who claims to be a football fan but has never\nowned a copy of this game is clearly lying \u2013 the\ntwo are mutually exclusive. Rugby fans (wrong\nball), Americans (can\u2019t even name the sport right)\nand girls (computer game plus football equals unfortunate sausagefest) have never understood the\njoys of playing Football Manager, and although a\nfull tutorial for novices has been included in the\ngame for the first time, this article may have little\nrelevance to those who have never played the series before.\nTo those unfamiliar with Football Manager, the\nsimple premise is to give armchair fans a chance\nto become real-life managers in a way no normal\nfantasy football game can, with almost every possible aspect of running a team available for tinker-ing. The game is seriously addictive; wives and\ngirlfriends of those that play are commonly known\nas \u2018Football Manager Widows\u2019 for good reason.\nAfter only a week of playing the new release, I can\nconfirm that time flies just as quickly as in previous years, and hours spent fiddling with tactics\nand making moves in the transfer market pass by\nwithin the blink of an eye. In fact, every full stop\nin this article not only indicates the end of a sen-tence, but also the immediate minimizing of this\ndocument and another twenty minutes spent taking\nthe mighty Dagenham & Redbridge back into the\nPremier League. Whilst the continuity and quality\nof this article may suffer as a result of my poor attention span, with a Carling Cup tie againstArsenal\njust round the corner and my team sitting outside\nthe playoffs, this piece just has no real significance\nin comparison.\nEach annual release of FM is fundamentally\na slight variation on the previous, yet minor improvements in gameplay and an updated database\nforce thousands of fans to splash the cash on an annual basis. This year is no different, with numerous\nnew features tempting us addicts like a free beer\nfestival for alcoholics. Each new database over the\nyears has offered their own quirks and anomalies,\nincluding various overrated players, but the joy in\nfinding those hidden wonderkids in the depths of\nthe Slovakian lower leagues and fielding a team\nincluding the likes of Stefan Kuntz, Yo-Suk Bum,\nArgel Fucks and Wan King make up for Jermaine\nPennant bizarrely starting for England. Making\nmagical transfer moves (my personal favourite\nwas bringing Roberto Baggio to Watford in 2004)\nhas become that little bit easier, as you can now\noffer loyalty bonuses to players and are able to\n\u2018lock\u2019 certain areas of your contract negotiations,\nmeaning there are no more frustrating \u201cDavid\nN'Gog demands an increase of \u00a3300 to his contract\u201d moments. Another new feature perfect for\nthose hoping to replicate the wild career paths of\nRoy Hodgson and Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson is the ability to add additional foreign leagues to your save\ngame at any point. As soon as your season in the\nPremier League or La Liga gets a bit frustrating\nthen the opportunity to pack your bags and head to\nthe lowly Finnish Third Division has never been so\neasy, and the convenience of not having to choose\nwhich nations are playable at the start of your career means the game can process at a far quicker\nspeed (\u201cI know my game is loading slower than\nEmile Heskey, but one day I might want to manage\nin the Indonesian Premier Division!\u201d)\nUp until recently the idea of interacting with\nplayers scared many users (\u201ca distraction from\nproper football,\u201d they claimed), yet the feature is\nimproved upon yet again with the ability to take on\na persona during team talks, and a range of \u2018tones\u2019\nallows even more customization of your man-management style. Whether it be a bit of the ol\u2019\nFergie \u2018hairdryer\u2019 treatment or playing it cool like\nMourinho, the instant player feedback highlights\nthe impact of your words, giving a more conversational feel to the dressing room \u2013 although there\ndoesn\u2019t appear to be an \u2018offer your team shit advice in your poorly pronounced Italian-English\u2019\noption, \u00e0 la Fabio Capello. Be careful though \u2013\nwhen the mid-season rut of poor results dampen\nyour season\u2019s hopes, your players\u2019 moral takes on\neven more importance and the way in which you\nverbally rape your players after that 0-0 draw with\nSwansea can have devastating, and perhaps exag-gerated, effects.\nWhilst the new \u2018Intelligent Interface\u2019 may at first\nappear a bit crowded and overwhelming, once you\nhave grown used to the extra information crammed\ninto your screen you begin to wonder how you ever\nused to stay up till 3am playing without it. However, I have never liked the interactive media conferences and they remain as hopeless as ever with\nreactions from your players and the media either\nconfusing or overdramatic, and although the novelty of storming out of a press conference for no\napparent reason never ceases to amuse, this aspect\nof the game remains an unnecessary disruption between match days. Similarly, whilst the 3D graphics engine during matches has improved some\u201cWives and girlfriends of\nthose who play are known\nas \u2018Football Manager\nWidows\u2019 for good reason\u201d\nwhat, I\u2019ve never been convinced by it and couldn\u2019t\nreally care less if I can see Titus Bramble concede\nan own goal in improved animation. Call me old-fashioned, but I remember the days when I got by\nwith commentary text only and the (epileptic fit in-ducing) flashing text of \u201cGOAL FOR LAZIO!!!!!\u201d\nsent me into howls of excitement. Whist the 2D\nmatch engine was a revolutionary feature in FM05,\nthe 3D view stills has the quality of a crappy 90\u2019s\nPS1 game and needs a bit of attention.\nThere are those who simply skim through a season in a day, only ever distracted from match days\nwith the occasional headline transfer, yet this type\nof user does the game a disservice and fails to experience the microscopic depth of control available as the most acute details can make or break\na season. It is not until you fully immerse yourself\ninto the game and begin organising your team\u2019s\ntraining schedule, choreographing your team\u2019s set-pieces and start buying unknown Brazilian seventeen year olds, that you can truly experience FM at\nits best. Some say that this sort management sim\nis nothing more than dull spreadsheets and num-bers, but these morons have no imagination and\ncan fuck off back to playing Mario Kart. Where\nFootball Manager succeeds is that unlike almost\nevery other game there are an infinite amount of\ncareer paths and gameplay is not bound by specific\nmissions or tasks \u2013 in FM you are completely free\nto roam the football world as you please. Whether\nit be showing Mourinho how it is done at Real Madrid; overhauling the likes of Yeovil Town with a\nbunch of skinny Romanian under-21s, or emigrating to Jamaica and bringing the World Cup trophy\nto the Caribbean, life as a Football Manager addict\nlooks set to continue.\nI\u2019ll give myself until Christmas before I pack it\nin and retire from the world of management, as the\npotential impact on my education is so great even\nanother season of Champions League football with\nTottenham Hotspur wouldn\u2019t make for it.\nI was told this guy has something to do with\nfootball\n\n"

    "content": "John Park\nFILM\nFELIX Friday 18 NOVEMBER 2011 35\nTo believe or not to believe?\nWas Shakespeare a fraud? The generally accepted answer is \u201cno\u201d but the\ndebate will go on, new evidence will be\nfound, and the sceptics will always find\nholes in the already laid-out, widely\nknown historical events. It\u2019s an interesting notion though, something that\nshouldn\u2019t possibly be immediately\ndismissed. If there is compelling reason to actually doubt the authorship\nof William Shakespeare, the man who\nhas been the icon of English literature\nfor centuries, then bring it on, which\nis what the brave Emmerich sets out to\ndo.\nYes, the man who loves destroying our beloved planet (Independence\nDay, The Day After Tomorrow) is the\nman directing a thought-provoking,\n\u201cwhat-if\u201d period piece. A change in\ngenre for sure, but Emmerich\u2019s Anonymous is just as intense as when he\nspends millions of dollars sucking every last breath out of the human race.\nSet in Elizabethan England, London is\ntransformed into a grim, damp place of\ngreed, betrayal, jealousy, and a whole\nload of back-stabbing. This moral corruption extends to people of all social\nclasses, from the grey streets of the\nEnglish capital, to the colourful royal\ncourts where the ageing Elizabeth I\n(Vanessa Redgrave) rules her country\nwith her humongous dresses and frightening make-up.\nA firm prologue, delivered with conviction by Derek Jacobi, sets the tone \u2013\nthat William Shakespeare never wrote\na single word of \u201chis\u201d work. How is\nthis possible? First, there\u2019s Edward\nde Vere, Earl of Oxford (Rhys Ifans),\nwhose brilliance with his words and\nprose came to life even at a young\nage. Playing Puck from A Midsummer\nNight\u2019s Dream at the age of ten, he\neven enchanted the then-young Elizabeth I (Vanessa Redgrave\u2019s daughter\nJoely Richardson). But writing plays\nis no job for an Earl, especially when\nhis father-in-law, William Cecil (David\nThewlis), a close advisor to the Queen,\nvehemently protests anything involving art or theatre. He claims that theatre\nis the satanic product of worshipping\nfalse idols.\nOne day however, he stumbles on\nsomething extraordinary. A crowd of\ntwo thousand being moved and united\nthrough one play alone. With his own\nplays, he predicts that he could bring\nthe house down. He approaches Ben\nJonson (Sebastian Armesto), a virtually\nunknown playwright, to stage his plays\nfor him. For years, de Vere has spent\nhours putting ink to paper, producing\nworks such as Macbeth, Hamlet, and\nJulius Caesar. By complete accident\nhowever, the good-for-nothing drunk\nactor Will Shakespeare (Rafe Spall)\nends up taking the writer\u2019s credit. He\u2019s\nilliterate too, but the crowd doesn\u2019t\nknow that. They embrace him, and are\nmoved by his words.\nSuccess and money corrupt Shakespeare and his obnoxious behaviour\nstarts to get on Jonson\u2019s nerves. Spall\nis fantastic as the slimy yet hilariously\nstupid Shakespeare, a horrifying portrayal for anyone who respects the man,\nbut this unique depiction is a welcome\nchange, and Spall is an invaluable pres-ence. Our sympathy goes out to Jonson\nmore than to anyone else, and Armesto\nplays the frustrations of a wronged man\nwith enough intensity and anger.\nFlashbacks that are comprehensibly\nedited in reveal more than expected,\ndiving into the intimate sides of de\nVere and Elizabeth. Disturbing twists\nand turns are presented, with dirty secrets that have been buried for years\nstarting to surface. The subplots hardly\never have happy endings, and the brutal\nfight for power is a good fun romp, with\nnumerous seedy characters pitching in\nfor unpredictable developments. The\nharsh palace life with unstable dynamic\nis boosted by the dark scenery made\neven more sinister by plenty of shadows coming from hundreds of candles.\nIfans is effortlessly convincing in the\nrole of a literary genius, and no matter how hard it may be to believe that\nhe can whip out a stirring play in a\nmatter of days, the struggles of an oppressed genius, trapped in a society of\nstrict boundaries is shown well in his\ncharacter\u2019s genuine passion for the-atre. The mother-daughter casting for\nQueen Elizabeth works brilliantly here,\nas hints of Richardson in Elizabeth\u2019s\nyouth can be seen later in Redgrave,\nboth of whom are magnetic their pivotal roles; they hold so much power.\nThis makes her the perfect target for\nsnarky \u201cadvisors\u201d to poison with their\nvenomous lies, adding another layer of\ntreacherous palace drama to the already\npacked narrative.\nWhether you believe in this alternate theory is obviously up to you. But\nAnonymous is a confident spin on what\nwas thought to be a well-known tale.\nIt would serve well as a period thriller\neven for those who are fans of Shakespeare and his works. Emmerich shows\nplenty of promise in directing films\noutside his usual disaster-film genre,\nand he has managed to create one of\nthe most exciting guilty pleasures of\nthis year.\nTop 10 Box\nOffice films\nin the UK this\nweek\n1) Immortals - 15 - Henry\nCavill, Freida Pinto, Mickey Rourke, Luke Evans\n2) Arthur ChristmasU - James McAvoy, Jim\nBroadbent, Bill Nighy\n3) The Adventures of\nTintin: The Secret of the\nUnicorn - PG - Jamie Bell,\nAndy Serkis, Daniel Craig\n4) In Time - 12A - Justin\nTimberlake, Amanda Seyfried\n5) Tower Heist - 12A -Ben Stiller, Eddie Murphy,\nCasey Affleck\n6) The Rum Diary - 15\n- Johnny Depp, Giovanni\nRibisi, Aaron Eckhart\n7) Johnny English Reborn - PG - Rowan Atkinson, Dominic West, Gillian Anderson\n8) The Help - 12A - Viola\nDavis, Octavia Spencer,\nEmma Stone\n9) Paranormal Activity 3 - 15 - Chloe Csengery, Jessica Tyler Brown,\nChristopher Nicholas\nSmith\n10) The Ides of March\n- 15 - George Clooney,\nRyan Gosling, Marisa Tomei, Evan Rachel Wood\nDirector Roland Emmerich\nScreenwriters Jon Orloff\nCast Rhys Ifans, Vanessa Redgrave,\nJoely Richardson, Rafe Spall,\nSebastian Armesto\nAnonymous\nLet\u2019s talk about mummy\u2019s little monster\nmoment at which they clearly become\nresponsible for Kevin\u2019s evil. He appears\nto have made it his mission to destroy\nhis mother\u2019s life before he is even born\n\u2013 at least from her perspective. Their\nbehaviour towards one another is self-perpetuating and fascinating to watch.\nEva certainly considers it to be her\nfault, whilst being manipulated by her\nson into apathy as he mutilates his little\nsister.\nTilda Swinton\u2019s portrayal of Eva is\nmasterful. By the (chronologically)\nlater scenes her life has been destroyed\nso utterly that the viewer is left unable\nto empathise with the strange shell that\nhas been left. After losing her family\nand business (exactly how she loses\nher money is not really explained \u2013 one\nof the film\u2019s few narrative slips) and\ngaining the almost universal hatred of\nthe townspeople she is left completely\nalienated and alone. Kevin is all she\nEvery scene contains a strong undercurrent of violence, from Kevin\u2019s traumatic birth through to the mass-murder\nwhich is the culmination of his life.\nThere is extensive use of bright colour\n\u2013 most obviously red, which symbolises\nfirst the threat and later the paralysing\nguilt of Kevin\u2019s traumatised mother.\nThe camera focuses on awkward and\nanxious movements of hands, feet and\nmouths. A shot involving the consumption of a lychee is particularly vile.\nThe film opts out somewhat from the\ndiscussion of nature/nurture that was\nso prevalent in the book, exchanging\nrealist interactions with an oppressive\nand immediate sense of doom. In this\nit has much more in common with paranoid horror films like Rosemary\u2019s Baby\nthan the kitchen-sink mundane school\nof nastiness. While Kevin\u2019s mother\nEva and father Franklin are not the best\nparents, it is impossible to establish a\nI can\u2019t say that I walked into We Need\nto Talk About Kevin expecting a trippy,\nsynaesthetic nightmare. But that\u2019s what\nI got, and it was very good with it too.\nThe film is intensely visual \u2013 sparse on\ndialogue and filled with kaleidoscopic\nand non-chronological sequences, particularly in the first half. The linearity\nof the closing scenes is less impressive\nin many ways, in spite of Ezra Miller\u2019s\nhypnotically ugly and malevolent presence as the teenage Kevin.\nOh my god...you\u2019ve been tangoed!\nHenry Turner-Chambers\nDirector Lynne Ramsay\nScreenwriters Lynne Ramsay, Rory\nKinnear, Lionel Shriver (novel)\nCast Tilda Swinton, Ezra Miller, John\nC. Reilly\nWe Need to Talk About\nKevin\nWhere the hell\u2019s the tomato soup?!\nhas left. Since his infancy, each has\nbeen the only one to truly understand\nthe other. Their love, written in hatred\nas it is, is the only survivor of Kevin\u2019s\nmassacre. As individuals, neither made\nit out alive.\nIncidentally, who should sit next to\nme in the cinema but Simon Amstell! In\nretrospect I probably should have asked\nhim what he thought.\n\n"

    "content": "MUSIC\nNow, not then, JCQ\nYou can\u2019t go much further than Dunedin, New\nZealand, before you\u2019re on the way back again.\nNearly 20,000 kilometres away, give or take, it\u2019s\nprobably the remotest city in the world.\nWherever you go, though, it\u2019s usually only the\nlittle things that change. A good friend who moved\nto New Zealand was struck most by the habits of\nbarefoot supermarket shopping and thanking bus\ndrivers. But as you stand there reflecting on how\neverything\u2019s more or less the same on the other\nside of the world, you suddenly notice they have a\ndifferent sky.\nSo it is with the Dunedin band High Dependency\nUnit (HDU), whose claims to fame include touring with Shellac and exciting John Peel enough to\ncall them \u201cone of the 10 best bands in the world\nyou\u2019ve never heard of\u201d.\nStarting off on the Christchurch-based independent label Flying Nun Records with Abstinence: Acrimony (1995), HDU have released 6 or 7 records\n(depending how you count) and a bunch of EPs of\ndirty psychedelic punk. This isn\u2019t punk played with\npace: HDU take their time, the songs building up\nto what for most bands would be a starting point.\nThe vocals are the slow slur of a drunk proclaiming happily to a world hurrying by. Their sound has\nbecome even more drawn out, more ambient as\nthey\u2019ve aged.\nYou could argue that the ethereal soundscapes\nof their latest release, Metamathics (2008) \u2013\nwhich drummer Dino Karlis pointed out was \u201cthe\nfirst album where we\u2019ve used hand-claps, the first\nwhere we\u2019ve used saxophone and the first where\nwe\u2019ve used piano\u201d \u2013 aren\u2019t punk at all, but I\u2019m not\ngoing to. HDU just do things at a distance. Familiar\nenough to be uncanny; same bedrock, different\nsky.\nThe local New Zealand scene even has a name\n\u2013 the \u201cDunedin sound\u201d - which is helpfully characterised by one well-known Internet source as\n\u201cjingly jangly\u201d. Indeed, Flying Nun Records was\nalso a home to the Californian band Pavement\nwho made up for not being local by being the jingli-est jangliest band of the lot. If you wanted a more\nupbeat variety of Dunedin punk, check out the\nsimilarly psychedelic but far more bouncy Die Die\nDie! who share a split 7\u201d with HDU.\nAll of HDU\u2019s releases can be streamed by turning\non the tap at highdependencyunit.bandcamp.\ncom \u2013 but don\u2019t rush things. Let it drip drip drip. If\nyou need a chaser you can stream one song from\nDie Die Die!\u2019s latest We Built Our Own Oppressors\n(2010) at diediedie.bandcamp.com.\nT\nhis week I\u2019m going back straight\nback to the UK post-punk/hard-core scene by way of a review of\nthe debut full-length album of The\nJames Cleaver Quintet (JCQ),\nThat Was Then, This Is Now. Nearly two years\nago the JCQ released their first and only EP\nTen Stages of a Make Up to massive critical ac-claim. Fans have been eagerly awaiting another\nrelease and on Halloween this year, they were\ngiven what they wanted.\nIf you read my review of &U&I\u2019s album Light\nBearer two weeks ago then you will know that I\nlike my music one way and one way only: men-tal. That Was Then, This Is Now fits perfectly\ninto this category. The album opens with a track\ntitled \u2018Golfing Pros, Bitches and Hoes\u2019. This\ntrack starts off with an eerie tune, reminiscent of\nsomething you would hear at a fairground, but\nafter only 15 seconds, shit gets real.\nTheir sound is completely unique, if I could\ndescribe it in any way it would be a divine\ncombination of garage post-punk and hardcore.\nPunkcore? Garage post-hunk? No, that\u2019s too\nweird. Sounds like a lost member of the Village\nPeople. But listen to the album and you\u2019ll know\nwhat I mean.\nThe songs are fast-paced, with massive riffs\nand breakdowns. In terms of the singing in-volved, there is certainly an element of signature hardcore roaring but a lot of the vocals are\nmelodic and extremely catchy. Every song has\na chorus that I can guarantee will be stuck in\nyour head at some point, which is uncommon\nfor a post-punk/hardcore album and definitely\na breath of fresh air. Vocalist Jack Saunders has\nshow there is always some blood coming from\nsomewhere (usually the bassist\u2019s face). This\ndefinitely comes across on the album and from\nstart to finish you feel like you\u2019re in the presence of this amazing band.\nTen Stages of a Make-Up was an incredible\nEP and I wasn\u2019t sure if they would be able to top\nit but they have had a bloody good go. They currently have a free download (available on their\nFacebook page) of an awesome track from the\nalbum if you\u2019re interested. If you\u2019re reading this\nin a lecture then I have only one thing to say to\nyou: f**k lectures, go and listen to this album!\na distinctive style, with an almost pop-punk\nsound in the less wild sections of the songs.\nThe tracks themselves are diverse, some of\nthem being heavily post-punk without much of\na hardcore element, and some of them being\nutter skull-crushing noise (in a good way). A\ncouple of the tracks also have a definite blues\nfeel with one of them, titled \u2018The JCWho?\u2019\nbeing a full on jazz number until a hardcore\nbreakdown mid-song.\nIf you have been to one of their shows, you\nwill know of their unmistakably punk attitude,\nindicated by the fact that by the end of each\nFELIX Friday 18 november 2011 29\nPunk Planet by\nDouglas Heaven\nThis week: High Dependency Unit\nApocalypse at the Union\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Martinez de Rituerto prophesies the End Times with Music Tech\nGeorge Jeffery on golfing pros, bitches and hoes\nF\nollowing the interlude at the Felix Music Night last weekend, Music Tech\nSociety return to Metric next Saturday\n26 November with their first We Are Metric\nnight of the year.

This Channel 4 drama attempts\nto give an accurate portrayal of life on the East\nLondon estates. It touches on themes such as\nsingle parenthood, gangs, drugs and violence,\ntemptation and the desire to make something of\nespecially in desperate situations.

I\u2019ll let the activists\non page 22 do that\u2026 I\u2019m here to cover\nsomething far more straightforward and\nyet something that even the cleverest of\nyou lot seem incapable of understanding.\nIndividual change. Students (and staff) at\nImperial often stare at me blankly when\nI suggest making small changes to their\ndaily lives that are neither especially\ninconvenient nor expensive, generally\nstating (often vehemently) that \u2018it won\u2019t\nmake a difference\u2019. If you\u2019ll indulge me,\nI\u2019ll walk you through exactly what we\ncould do at Imperial, with minimal effort.\nAll my figures come from http://www.\ndothegreenthing.com/wiki. Feel free to\ncontact me for clarification.\nAn Imperial student wakes up in the\nmorning and takes a shower seven\nminutes shorter than her usual fifteen.\nBANG, she saved 0.63kg Equivalent\nCO2 (CO2e). She then gets dressed and\ngoes to the kitchen where she grabs the\njam and digs out the dregs stuck at the\nbottom of the jar before looking for a new\none. BANG, by not throwing away the\njar before it was really empty (and not\nthrowing away old vegetables whenever\nfresh ones arrive) she has saved an\naverage of 8.53kg CO2e per week. On\nher way to lectures she passes by the\nJCR and refills her water bottle. BANG,\n0.22kg CO2e by not buying a new water\nbottle. She then runs up to her lecture\nin Pippard LT saving 0.5KgCO2e each\nday by not taking the lift five floors. At\nlunch she picks the vegetarian option\nand saves 8.65kg CO2e. At home that\nevening she has her shopping delivered\n(1.64KgCO2e saved). Dinner is seasonal\nand organic (1.34 and 0.64KgCO2e\nsavings respectively). She then does her\nwashing and dries her clothes on a rack in\nher room. (1.90 kg CO2e saved per load).\nYou get the idea. Through ten simple and\neasy steps she has saved 5603Kg* CO2e\nin a year. If that were multiplied out by\n15000 (the population of Imperial \u2013 ish)\nit would save 84,000 tonnes of CO2e\nemissions. Imperial\u2019s calculated carbon\nfootprint for 2008/9 was 84,026 tCO2 \u2013\nfor all campuses. I\u2019m as surprised as you\nare. Small actions can make a difference.\nGo to http://thedonation.org.uk/doers/\nicugreenweek/green-week and pledge to\nSomething. Anything.

How do you accrue\nmore time? If you are one of throng of the pro-letariat, by working for it, if you happen to be\none of the rich, by doing evil capitalist stuff like\nexploiting the poor, owning banks etc. In this\ndystopian world you pay for everything with\ntime, from buying a coffee to paying for your\nbus fare. Poor people struggling to accrue time\nface increases in the cost of living which drains\ntheir clock and potentially brings about their\nearly death. To separate the haves and the have-nots, ghettos have sprung up. These are crime\nridden slums where people steal time from each\nother. In these districts people will \u201cmurder you\nfor a week .\u201d Contrasting this is New Greenwich, a bastion for the rich where people are\nrendered practically immortal by the thousands\nof years they possess.\nSo In Time is a not-so thinly veiled metaphor\nfor the inevitable inequality which arises as a\nresult of unrestrained capitalism. It is a prudent\nmetaphor then, at a time of economic stagnation and financial uncertainty. A time when, if\nthe Occupy Wall Street movement is anything\nto go by, America seems to be waking up to the\nIn brief\nThe new 007 is a go\nMGM\u2019s financial woes, be gone! After months of\nspeculation on whether England\u2019s iconic, bed-hopping, ass-kicking agent will return or not after\nits production company decided to declare bank-ruptcy, Daniel Craig\u2019s third outing as James Bond\nwas finally given the green-light last week, along\nwith its title, a couple of Bond girls for Craig to\nno doubt shag, and an official confirmation on the\nrest of its cast to put all sorts of internet rumours\nto rest.\nThe title \u2013 Skyfall: an improvement from its predecessor Quantum of Solace for sure, but perhaps\nnot quite as slick and stylish as Casino Royale.\nCraig wasn\u2019t allowed to expand too much on what\nthe title is referring to, but producer Barbara Broccoli briefly stated that it may have \u201csome emotional context which will be revealed in the film.\u201d Just\nwhat emotion the word Skyfall may be referring to\nis not clear at this point, but it appears we need to\nwait a whole another year to find out what is going\non, with the film\u2019s release date set for Friday 26\nOctober 2012 including a London premiere that\nwill no doubt take over the redecorated Leicester\nSquare.\nMore often than not, especially among certain\nindividuals down here in the Felix office, the casting of Bond girls generates more interest than anything else, and so the news of Naomie Harris and\nFrench actress B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Marlohe (pictured above)\nlanding the two crucial roles is a welcome one.\nThis will be Marlohe\u2019s Hollywood debut, in which\nshe will play a \u201cglamorous and enigmatic\u201d char-acter, whereas Harris, who was once rumoured\nto be playing Miss Moneypenny, landed the role\nof a \u201cfield agent.\u201d In addition, Judi Dench will be\nreprising her role as M for the seventh time in a\nrow, with Javier Bardem, who once ferociously portrayed an unforgettable villain in the Coen brothers\u2019 No Country for Old Men, will play the film\u2019s\nmain antagonist. Prominent Brit names are also\nappearing in yet-unspecified roles, with Ralph\nFiennes, Albert Finney, Helen McCrory and Ben\nWhishaw also on board.\nFilming has already begun, with the Academy\nAward winning Sam Mendes directing. The official\nJames Bond twitter reads \u201c8.45am, 07/11/11:\n\u2018Action!\u2019 was called for the first time on the 23rd\nJames Bond movie, Skyfall. We are officially go!\u201d It\nis certainly nice to have you back Bond.\nThe American producer/director Brett Ratner, known for such films as Rush Hour, Red\nDragon and newly-released Tower Heist, has\nstepped down from his prominent position as\nproducer of the 2012 Oscars.\nHis resignation follows a string of inappropriate comments in a number of recent media\nappearances, most notably for using an offensive term in an interview while promoting\nhis new film Tower Heist, and a very strange\ntelephone interview on Howard Stern\u2019s radio\nshow, during which he gave explicit details of\nhis sex life.\nIn a letter of resignation, 42-year-old Ratner\nsaid that he had \u201cgotten a well-deserved earful from many of the people I admire most\nin this industry expressing their outrage and\ndisappointment over the hurtful and stupid\nthings I said in a number of recent media ap-pearances. To them, and to everyone I\u2019ve hurt\nand offended, I\u2019d like to apologise publicly\nand unreservedly.\u201d\nRatner\u2019s first blunder was made during a\npromotional interview for his Tower Heist\ntwo weeks ago. A member of the studio audience asked whether he had found it hard handling rehearsals for a group of such actors as\nEddie Murphy, Ben Stiller, Casey Affleck and\nGabourey Sidibe, to which Ratner\u2019s response\nwas: \u201cRehearsal? What\u2019s that? Rehearsals for\nfags.\u201d This comment caused outrage, despite\nthe Academy of Motion Pictures, Arts and\nSciences (who run the Oscars) making an official apology condemning Ratner.\nThe filmmaker then made the decision to\ngive a telephone interview on the Stern radio\nshow, which was supposed to be to apologise\nfor previously implying a sexual relationship\nbetween himself and Iron Man 2 actress Olivia Munn. Instead of the expected apology,\nhowever, Ratner chose instead to regale the\nlisteners with tales of his past sexual con-quests, his oral sex skills, the size of his balls,\nhis masturbation techniques, his disdain for\ncondoms\u2026and much more. Needless to say,\nthis did not go down too well on national\nradio, despite the fact that Ratner was being\nencouraged to spill the beans by the show\u2019s\nhost.\nFollowing the resignation last week, the\npresident of the Academy, Tom Sherak, was\nquoted as saying that Ratner had \u201cdone the\nright thing for the Academy, and for himself.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cBrett is a good person, but his\ncomments were unacceptable.\u201d\nRatner has now been replaced by Brian\nGrazer, the Oscar-winning producer of A\nBeautiful Mind. \u201cBrian Grazer is a renowned\nfilmmaker who over the past 25 years has\nproduced a diverse and extraordinary body of\nwork,\u201d said Sherak. \u201cHe will certainly bring\nhis tremendous talent, creativity and relationships to the Oscars.\u201d\nIn light of Ratner\u2019s resignation, his friend\nEddie Murphy has also quit his role as the\npresenter of the 2012 Oscars show. The come-dian/actor was hired by Ratner to rejuvenate\nthe show after its lacklustre ceremony last\nyear; Murphy\u2019s appointment was an attempt\nto return to the programme\u2019s original winning\nformula of having a comedian presenting. After his resignation, Murphy said: \u201cI was truly\nlooking forward to being a part of the show\nthat our production team and writers were just\nstarting to develop, but I\u2019m sure that the new\nproduction team and host will do an equally\ngreat job.\u201d\nDespite an online campaign for the Muppets to take over from Murphy gaining popularity last week, the Academy has announced\nthat Billy Crystal will be filling the role. The\n63-year-old actor has previously hosted the\nOscars nine times, most recently in 2004.\n\u201cSome of the best moments of my career have\nhappened on the Oscar stage,\u201d he said.\nThe 84th Academy Awards ceremony is due\nto take place at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles on Sunday 26 February 2012.\nfact that the unfettered dominance of corporations in its society has a largely negative impact\non the majority its population, or at least if they\nwere already aware they are no longer willing\nto put up with it.\nThe messages that the film tries to get across\nare admirable, but where the film falls down is\nthat the cast come across largely as caricatures.\nThe rich spout ideas about social Darwinism\nand the necessity of a downtrodden underclass\nwhilst carelessly gambling away thousands of\nyears of life. The \u201ctimekeepers\u201d (In Time pun-speak for policemen) wax lyrical about the necessity of maintaining the status quo and how\ntoo much time in the hands of the poor would\n\u201ccrash the system.\u201d The film rams home the\npoints it makes with the subtlety of a sledgehammer and as a result, leaves the characters\nfeeling distinctly one dimensional. Add to that\nthe fact that the later scenes descend into a series of action movie clich\u00e9s and you are ultimately left with the feeling that a potentially\ndecent premise has been squandered. Justin\nTimberlake does an admirable job in the lead\nbut the the supporting cast are merely serviceable due mainly to the flat characters they are\nasked to portray.\nNiccol writes and directs a film very similar\nto his previous work Gattaca, but one which\ndoesn\u2019t reach the same heights due to a lack of\nwell rounded characters and clunking lack of\nsubtlety in deliverance of its core messages.\nTime is money in the new sci-fi In Time\nBrett Ratner resigns as Oscar Producer\nTim Davies\nDirector Andrew Niccol\nScreenwriter Andrew Niccol\nCast Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried\nIn Time\nLucy Wiles\nGimme Gimme Gimme some time (feat.

With a single\npiece of commodity hardware, it is\npossible to access realtime information from a huge array of local sensors\nsuch as GPS, a camera, microphone, ac-celerometer, compass and a barometer.\nCombine that with the ability for your\nsmartphone to provide context (through\nyour social networks and location) and\nthe ability to pull in data from millions\nof sources online, all you need to do is\nto combine data from those sources in a\nuseful way to solve a real problem and\nthe hardware and APIs do the rest. With\nthe ease of innovating on the smartphone platform, it\u2019s no wonder the pace\nof innovation has been so quick.\nImproving lives\nIn the UK, mobile applications have\nhelped us to communicate with our\npeers around the world, to live healthier\nlives, saved us time and saved us mon-ey. \u2018Google Translate\u2019 and \u2018Word Lens\u2019\nhave helped us to traverse language\nbarriers and to communicate with\npeople regardless of whether or not we\nshare a common language. \u2018Transport\nfor London\u2019 and \u2018Addison Lee\u2019 have\nhelped us to get home safely after a\nnight out. Various GPS navigation apps\nsave us time by routing us around traffic jams \u2013 traffic jams reported by other\nusers of the application. Applications\nsuch as \u2018ShopSavvy\u2019 compare prices\nagainst other high-street shops and online stores so we don\u2019t get ripped off.\nThe \u2018Asthmapolis\u2019 application helps\nasthma sufferers by tracking their\nsymptoms over time, looking for a deterioration in symptoms and analysing\nwhere those symptoms occur so public\nhealth officials can find the source of\nthe pollution. And there\u2019s Lewisham\nCouncil who keep their streets clean\nwith a mobile app for members of the\npublic to report graffiti, fly-tipping and\nother environmental crimes.\nLooking to the developing world, the\npromise for mobile technology to have\na positive social impact seems to be\neven greater. Many developing countries currently lack the efficient physical infrastructure we take for granted\n(the roads, phone lines, GP surgeries\nand banks). Mobile technology can be\ndeployed incredibly quickly in these\ncountries as one mast covers a huge\narea \u2013 instantly giving the population\naccess to services such as mobile bank-ing, healthcare and trade. Several short\nmobile phone calls will allow a farmer\nor a producer to determine the price he\ncan sell his goods at different markets\nand to negotiate the best price without\nspending days making successive trips\nto different markets.\nMobile banking companies such as\nM-Pesa allows people to invest money for their future and to pay suppliers without a long journey to the bank\nwhilst also eliminating the risks and\ncosts of transporting physical money.\nOther apps such as EpiSurveyor help\nwith disease monitoring: they allow\nphysicians to monitor the spread of\ndiseases in real-time without the delay\nintroduced by sending and collating\npaper forms.\nMobile innovation\nThe potential to change the world and\nto make money in the world of mobile\ntechnology is unparalleled. The mobile\napplication market is already worth\n$15bn annually and is only set to continue growing exponentially. Globally,\nthe number of people with a mobile\nphone is set to pass 4.5 billion by 2012.\nMany of the next one billion people to\nbe connected to a mobile network will\nreside in Asia, the Middle East or Africa\n\u2013 these are people who will be accessing the internet for the first time through\ntheir mobile phone.\nAs the UK struggles through our deepest recession to date, we should realise\nthat long term economic growth only\ncomes from making things that better\nother people\u2019s lives. If I can produce a\nproduct which is worth \u00a310 to you but\nonly costs me \u00a32 to produce, I could sell\nit for \u00a35 and it\u2019s a win-win situation. It\u2019s\nonly by creating real value that we can\nbuild a sustainable economy: speculating on the markets in an investment\nbank doesn\u2019t provide this long term\nvalue and isn\u2019t a sustainable model for\nthe UK economy. The mobile industry\nis one which has a huge positive social\nimpact as well as huge potential for new\nideas.\nWhether you\u2019re an engineer or a scientist at Imperial, I believe the mobile industry provides a unique opportunity for\nyou to develop the new products which\nbenefit society with almost no cost and\nno risk to you. Take a look at the Android Developer website for example:\nit\u2019s free to anyone interested and there\nare countless tutorials to get you started.\nWith no investment required apart from\nyour time, there\u2019s little to lose.\nKin-Hing Lo explores the revolutionary impact of mobile proliferation on our lives\nA\ns each second ticks away,\nthere\u2019s a quiet revolution\ngoing on in every town\nand every city across the\nglobe. Mobile technology disrupts the way we live our lives,\nthe way we communicate with others\nand the way we function as a society.\nIn the time it\u2019s taken you to read just\nthis sentence, over 3,000 mobile applications have been downloaded to handsets across the world. Many of these\napplications may just be pointless bird\nthrowing, rope cutting and fruit slicing\ngames but a growing number of innovative new applications are changing the\nway in which we communicate, shop\nand travel.\nFreeing innovation\nJust a couple of years ago, creating a\nnew and innovative product to solve a\nproblem would require you to design a\nbespoke piece of hardware, manufacture it, distribute it and retail it through\na high street store or a mail-order cata-logue. You\u2019d need to find a designer,\na manufacturer and suppliers for your\ncomponents. Then you\u2019ve got to find\na distributor to take your product, a retailer willing to dedicate the shelf space\nto it and a marketing firm to promote it.\nThe route from idea to marketplace was\nslow, expensive and risk-ridden: launching a new product to solve real world\nproblems was a process accessible only\nto those with the deepest pockets and\nMobile applications have intrinsically changed the way we process information and go about our daily lives\n\n"

    "content": "BUSINESS\nBusiness Editors: Be\u00f1at Gurrutxaga-Lerma\nNina Kearsey\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIf you have found time to follow the news in\nbetween episodes of Made in Chelsea and The\nX Factor, then you will be aware that Groupon,\nconsidered the fastest growing company ever,\nhas recently been valued at $12.7bn. The company\u2019s rapid global expansion and large valuation (the highest since Google was launched in\n2004) imply it is a hugely successful business.\nHowever, investors question whether the company\u2019s business model is sustainable, and suggest that internet giants Google and Facebook\ncould prevent Groupon from dominating the\nsocial buying industry. So can Groupon maintain the position it has propelled itself into, or\nare its days in the spotlight over?\nThe idea behind Groupon is simple: bulk\nbuying is cost effective. Groupon utilizes this\ntruth by offering vouchers for services and\nproducts at a fraction of the retail price, providing that enough people purchase the deal.\nThis is theoretically beneficial for all parties\nas the consumer saves money, the participating\nbusinesses gain new customers and Groupon\ngenerates profit by taking cuts of around 50%.\nIt sounds ideal, but does it work in reality?\nGroupon has 115 million subscribers (August\n2011) with 32.5 million vouchers purchased in\nthe last quarter; the site seems popular with the\npublic. But for small businesses, such as restaurants and beauty salons which Groupon depend\nheavily upon, the outcome is not always posi-tive. Many small businesses have been overwhelmed by the influx of customers, running\nout of stock or not fitting in everybody\u2019s appointments before the vouchers expired (tragic\nfor those who absolutely need their fake tan\nby Friday!) On top of this, participation is not\nalways lucrative for businesses as discounts\nare so large, many of them suffer loses while\nbargain hunters seek the next giveaway ahead\nof becoming loyal repeat customers. Groupon\nis expected to generate $1.7bn of revenue this\nyear which, whilst sounding impressive, in fact\nequates to little more than breaking even.\nThere is a major lack of organisation within\nthe company due to its rapid development in\nsuch a short space of time. Initially based in\nChicago, Groupon now operates in 175 North\nAmerican markets and has quickly spanned\nthe globe entering into 47 countries so far. The\nnumber of employees has soared from 39 to\nover 10,000. Although these figures sound im-pressive, they are accompanied with internal\nchaos. Communications within the company\nhave been criticised and employees have complained that people in managerial roles were\nfriends of the founder and are now not experienced enough for their current role. The lack\nof organisation is not restricted to employees;\nthere are numerous reports of vouchers being\nsold for a business which had since been closed\ndown and customers not receiving a promised\nrefund. Two Imperial students had first-hand\nexperience of Groupon\u2019s chaotic communications when they were offered internships in\nChina, signed a contract and were told a few\ndays before they were due to fly that the placement was no longer possible.\nThe most notorious of Groupon\u2019s mistakes\nwas simultaneously upsetting the Chinese and\nTibetan populations when they released an advertisement which made a plea for the people\nof Tibet \u2013 \u201cThe people of Tibet are in trouble\u201d\n\u2013 before jokingly adding \u201cbut they still whip\nup an amazing fish curry.\u201d Complaints came\nin thick and fast over Groupon light heartedly\nusing the suffering of Tibetans in order to promote their product.\nIn fact the story of Groupon\u2019s attempt to\nenter the Chinese market is adorned with set-backs. They stormed into a joint venture with\nGaopeng in February, establishing themselves\nwithin a couple of months. China is notoriously\nhostile to international companies and Groupon\nis no exception. Now most of the international\nmanagers, oblivious to the Chinese culture,\nhave since been removed and returned to their\nrespective home countries. Just last week Groupon hit the rocks again for accidently linking\nup with a company selling counterfeit luxury\nwatches. Many speculate that Groupon are\nheading downhill in the direction of other internet giants such as Yahoo and Google who failed\nto break into the harsh Chinese market.\nIn 2010 Groupon famously rejected\nGoogle\u2019s offer to buy the company for $6bn.\nFighting back from its rejection, Google has\nlaunched Google Offers \u2013 a site with a startling resemblance to Groupon. Competition is\nnothing new for Groupon (there are over 500\nsimilar sites in America alone) but few pose\nsuch a significant threat to the social buying giant. Facebook has created their version\nwhich when fully established and implemented across the globe could see the end of Groupon\u2019s time at the top. With such an extensive\nuser base Facebook has the potential to knock\nGroupon off of the playing field and dominate\nsocial buying. Google and Facebook also have\nthe advantage of not being the first to enter the\nmarket meaning they can steal the successful\nelements of Groupon whilst avoiding many of\nthe mistakes.\nIn order to survive Groupon must be inno-vative. Launching \u2018Groupon Now\u2019 may have\nbeen a step in the right direction. This service\nharnesses the smartphone craze and opens an\nentirely new revenue stream. The simple interface consists of the two buttons, \u201cI\u2019m hungry\u201d\nand \u201cI\u2019m bored\u201d which use GPS to provide the\nuser with deals for eateries and entertainment\nclose to their location. This differs from the\nclassic \u2018daily deals\u2019, which can be redeemed\nseveral months later, and provides an attractive option for businesses as they can increase\nsales during usually slow periods. Another\nnew product, \u2018Groupon Rewards,\u2019 implemented in September in an attempt to increase\n-customer loyalty. Customers who purchase\nmultiple vouchers from a business which regularly offers Groupon deals will \u2018unlock\u2019 rewards which entitle them to further discounts.\nThis will allow Groupon to accurately track\nhow many people are repeat customers, how\nmuch individuals spend on average and should\nincrease the number of purchases per user.\nGroupon, one of the hottest internet start-ups, has wowed the world with its unprecedented rate of growth. Whether it will win\nthe battle against Google and Facebook is yet\nto be determined. Only by addressing its fundamental errors, embracing new technologies\nand continuing down the innovative road they\nwill they stand a chance in defying the odds\nand emerging as the rightful ruler of the Social\nBuying Empire.\nwww.imperialentrepreneurs.com\nBy\nAnnabelle Mayers\nGroupon: Is the social\nbuying giant losing fuel?\nGroupon must take on Google and Facebook if it is to triumph\nIn the Guardian comment cartoon published this\nMonday, artist Martin Rowson depicts a repentant\n\u201cSt. Vince\u201d Cable as a monk, exiled to the desert\nwhere he is camped outside a tent marked OCCUPY. It comes in response to an interview conducted\nover the BBC\u2019s The Politics Show broadcast this\nSunday in which Cable admitted he shared \u201csympathy with the emotions behind [the movement]\u201d.\nThe interview marked a return to the spotlight\nfor the current Business Secretary, who has been\nnotably absent in the media (as from a previously\nheld role in media policy) since last December\nwhen he publicly declared war on the Murdoch empire following their BSkyB takeover bid. However it\nseems already that this most recent interview is\ncementing the image of Cable as somewhat of a\nPR liability. In voicing empathy for the occupiers,\nCable has simultaneously managed to go against\nDavid Cameron\u2019s public line of scepticism \u2013 \u201cprotesting is something you, on the whole, should do\non two feet, rather than lying down, in some cases\nin a fairly comatose state\u201d \u2013 and anger those supporters of the movement who view his attempts\nto reconnect with public spirit as little short of\nhypocrisy following the perceived sell-out to the\nConservatives over issues such as the austerity\nmeasures and raising of tuition fees.\nBut such political and judicial slip-ups shouldn\u2019t\nundermine the reputation of the Business Secretary as economist. Also present in Rowson\u2019s cartoon is the desert of the economic landscape: flat-lining growth figures of 0.7% for 2011 and 0.6%\nfor 2012, and, on the horizon, the tornado that is\nthe crisis in the eurozone. As the Politics Show\nhighlighted, Cable has a knack for predicting these\nkinds of economic \u2018weather systems\u2019. Before stepping into office he urged caution over the austerity measures, warning that to cut too far too fast\nwould impede growth. Now the man responsible\nfor the UK\u2019s growth strategy, Cable, will soon have\nthe chance to improve it.\nOn November 29 the Government will issue its\nAutumn Statement. Cable has already stated that\nit will not contain any large tax cuts or increases\nin public spending, but with Bloomberg reporting\npossible legislation to limit executive pay, inclus-ing options such as giving shareholders a binding\nvote on pay, and putting employees on company\nrenumeration committees, it looks as though he\nmay just have more to offer the protesters than a\nsympathetic ear.\n\u2013 The Business Editors\nLetter from the Editors\nWeatherforecasting during an\nEconomic Climate Change\nFELIX\n16 Only 1% of China\u2019s 560 million city residents breathe air that is considered safe by the European Union \u2013 GREEN WEEK 2011\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 18 NOVEMber 2011 21\nI\ndon\u2019t really know how to start this\narticle. That\u2019s quite embarrassing.\nThen again, I think that\u2019s a recurring theme in my life. I always find\na way to embarrass myself. In a\nway I\u2019m like Bob Dylan. Except it\u2019s embarrassment\u2019s door that I\u2019m knock knock\nknocking on. I then realise that I\u2019ve actually got the wrong door, just as it\u2019s too late\nand the person who lives there is opening\nit.\nI am a lightning rod for embarrassment.\nIf there is a name of a person I\u2019ve met too\nmany times to forget, I\u2019ll forget. If there\u2019s\na step to trip up on, I\u2019ll trip up on it. If\nthere\u2019s a song that I can mutter when I\u2019m\nwalking down the street, I\u2019ll mutter away.\nI\u2019ll then notice the odd looks and try to\ndecide if it\u2019s best to stop, or to just pretend I\u2019m on the phone with someone. If I\nget in a lift, I\u2019ll end up turning round and\nlooking at the mirror. Then someone gets\nin, sees me, and we have to have a silent\ntwo person lift ride. Of course, this is after\nI say \u2018which floor?\u2019; only to realise that\nthey had already pressed the button and\nmy voice had just broken up an octave as\nif I\u2019m 15.\nIf you ever see me walking into the library (that\u2019s just the kind of party animal\nlifestyle I lead) you will notice the doors\ndecide to open at the very last moment.\nOr sometimes, just not at all. This means\nI end up walking very close to the doors,\nawkwardly pausing when I lose my nerve\nand think it\u2019s not going to open, turning\nJakov Marelic\nTim Arbabzadah\nThe real benefit cheats\nThis title doesn\u2019t fit, that\u2019s quite emba...\nround, and then trying again. Throughout\nthis process, I try and fail to look non-chalant. I could give more examples, but\nthinking of them is making me cringe, so\nfor the rest of this I\u2019ll be a bit vague.\nOccasionally,whenI\u2019mtalkingtosomeone, I\u2019ll say something a bit weird. Then\nI have to try to laugh it off and stammer\nthrough the conversation. Unfortunately,\nthis is not in a charming Hugh Grant \u201cOh\nmy gosh I really am rather mortified, erm,\nblimey, erm, terribly sorry\u201d way, it\u2019s more\nof a \u201cNo, wait. I didn\u2019t mean\u2026 It was a\njoke\u2026 Stop walking away\u201d kind of way.\nWhenever I go out, especially if alcohol is involved, I\u2019ll inevitably wake up\nthe next morning (more accurately late\nafternoon \u2013 for anyone that knows me\nwell) feeling that familiar \u2018Oh shit, that\nactually happened didn\u2019t it, can I rewind\ntime?\u2019 sensation. Usually, followed by\na groan and that dreadful feeling that, at\nsome point soon, I\u2019m going to have to see\nthe people I was out with the night before.\nThis feeling is like Silvio Berlusconi to a\nwoman: it just refuses to leave me alone.\nFor the rest of the day I have to keep\nmy mind actively occupied with every\nthought except what happened last night.\nI like to think that I\u2019m not alone in this\npain. This torment. This mortally embarrassing coil. In fact, that\u2019s the point. You\nare not alone. Everyone feels this in some\nway; some are just better at hiding it than\nothers. Once you realise that everyone is\ntoo busy worrying about what embarrass-W\nelfare can be a\ncontroversial issue\nthese days, invoking heated debate.\nIt is often said\nthat the hard-working majority are\nforced to pay taxes for the idle few\nbenefit-scroungers who don\u2019t pull their\nweight. In these economic times, many\nhave wondered whether these payments should be cut.\nTrouble is: that\u2019s not the situation\nwe\u2019re actually in. Far from your taxes being spent mostly on the nation\u2019s\npoorest, more cash is actually handed\nout to the richest 1% through corporate\nwelfare and tax dodging.\nLast winter, the country was rocked\nby protests against tax avoidance. In\nparticular the UK Uncut group were\narguing against the alleged \u00a36 billion\nunpaid tax bill of Vodafone, in what\nthe investigative magazine Private Eye\ndescribed as \u201can unbelievable cave-in\u201d\nby Britain\u2019s top tax inspectors. To put\nthis figure into perspective, the total\ncost of Jobseekers Allowance in 2010-2011 was \u00a34.9 billion.\nAn excellent graphic representing\nthe total government expenditure for\n2010-2011 can be found on The Guardian newspaper\u2019s website. Using that,\nand other sources, we can look at the\nnumbers and decide whether it\u2019s right\nto blame the poor for runaway taxes\non the majority, or whether it\u2019s really\nsomeone else leeching off our nation\u2019s\ncollective wealth.\nApart from the already mentioned\nJobseekers Allowance (\u00a34.9 billion),\nother benefits perceived as unfair are\nincapacity benefit (\u00a37.7 billion) which\nhelps people too ill or disabled to work,\ncouncil tax benefit (\u00a34.9 billion), housing benefit (\u00a321.6 billion) and income\nsupport (\u00a37.8 billion). These figures are\nall benefit expenditure, honest or other-wise. Illegal benefit fraud accounts for\na mere \u00a31.1 billion.\nTax dodging comes in two flavours.\nIllegal tax evasion is where companies\nsimply hide their profits from the au-thorities. Legal tax avoidance is the art\nof finding loopholes, using tax havens,\nor otherwise \u201cgetting around\u201d obliga-tions. Like MPs cheating the expenses\nsystem, tax avoiders follow the letter\nbut not the spirit of the law. As the former Chancellor Denis Healey wrote:\n\u201cThe difference between tax avoidance\nand tax evasion is the thickness of a\nprison wall\u201d.\nOffshore tax havens are complicated\nand expensive to set up, often requiring entire teams of accountants, so\nthey are usually used only by multinational corporations and the extremely\nwealthy. A prominent example of this\nwas the retail giant Philip Green getting around his \u00a3285 million tax bill by\npaying all the profits to his wife who\nwas registered as living in the Monaco\ntax haven.\nHM Revenue & Customs own estimates say that \u00a360 billion is lost every\nyear through a combination of illegal\ntax evasion and legal tax avoidance.\nThe TaxJustice pressure group estimates \u00a3120 billion.\nThe new breed of too-rich-to-pay-tax freeloaders is hollowing out our\ning thing they did to care about what you\ndid, you are liberated. It\u2019s all really just\nin your head. The trick is just not letting\nit get to you. Unfortunately, that trick is\nlike doing a backflip: you may how to do\nit theoretically, but actually pulling it off\npractically is the hard part. That was a bit\nof a contrived simile. I feel quite emb\u2026\nahhh, damn it, see how hard it is?\nOkay, last night, after one too many,\nyou may have danced like a bit of an idiot.\nSure, at the time you felt like you were\nbeing a sleek suave Imperial version of\nJames Bond when you were trying to get\nwith that girl; but what\u2019s the worst that can\nreally happen? She, and everyone who\nnoticed, will tell people. With 6 degrees of\nseparation and all that everyone will know\nand sneer.Actually, that is pretty bad; I\u2019ve\nforgotten what my point was going to be\nas I\u2019m feeling your pain right now. Oh\nwait, it COULD have been worse. You\ncould have done an inebriated Tweet (@\ngirlthatsitsarowinfrontofme You\u2019re well\nfit, seriously, like, I definitely would #up-forit).

They take the benefits of a\nworking society, (police and fire pro-tection, national security, public roads,\nutilities, the internet, publicly funded\nresearch and development, educated\nworkers, etc.) but don\u2019t want to pay for\nthem. The burden thus falls ever harder\non the middle-class and the poor.\nIt should be pretty clear by now that\nthe money lost to corporate tax dodging by the rich is even greater than the\nmoney spent on the working and un-working poor.

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nO\nur streets are currently\nbeing occupied by\naggressive, murder-ous, polluting inhab-itants: cars. They are\neffectively environmental squatters.\nUnfortunately, whereas the crimi-nalisation of squatting, which was\nvoted through the Commons the\nother week, will throw thousands of\nthe most vulnerable in our society\nonto the street, it will do nothing to\nsolve the environmental and social\nills of cars. However, as it\u2019s Green\nWeek and all, I\u2019m taking this opportunity to explain why we don\u2019t need\nthem (which hopefully won\u2019t be too\ndifficult as west London is the most\ncongested area of London I cycle\nthrough).\nSimply put: our society is trapped\nin a dangerous car culture. As London students, it may not be an issue\nduring term time, but a large proportion of us probably drive when we\nget home in the holidays. A quarter\nof journeys though are less than 2\nmiles; which for the majority of us\ncan be easily substituted by walking,\nbiking and/or taking the bus. The\nlonger journeys can also regularly\nbe replaced by train and coach. It\u2019s\nan interesting point from research\nthat people tend to overestimate the\nlength of time to undertake a journey by public transport but underestimate that same journey by car. We\nhave actually warped the usefulness\nof cars in our minds, and the pseudo-freedom they promise us. Ask your-self: how free are you in traffic jams\nor stuck behind a tractor? This car\nobsession is damaging our planet, as\nnearly a fifth of our country\u2019s carbon\ndioxide emissions come out of their\nexhaust pipes.\nEnvironmentally, cars are not just\nresponsible for a large proportion of\nclimate change, but also, in cities,\npollute the air we breathe. A recent\nreport of 17 European cities by German environmental groups ranked\nLondon as one of the worst for air\npollution. This was attributed to the\nretraction of the congestion charge\nfrom West London, rises in public\ntransport costs and a lack of investment in clean buses.\nThere is also a social justice issue\nin this pollution. The statistical ge-ographer, Danny Dorling, found that\nthe places with the highest poverty\nrates were the areas of greatest pol-lution, but that also the inhabitants\nof these areas emitted the least. Essentially, due to our road distribu-tion, the most affluent \u2013 who are responsible for the majority of driving\nand polluting \u2013 are destroying the air\nquality where the poorest in our society live.\nOn top of the environmental fac-tors, cars are too often overlooked\nas the murderers they are. You may\nthink this is strong language, but\nwhen a terrorist attack, often provoked by imperialist wars, to everyone\u2019s regret kills 50 people we are\nup in arms. New laws are brought\nin, our civil liberties etched away\nand we go to war with two countries.\nHowever, this is minor compared to\nthe deaths at the hands of cars, which\nwe do nothing about as more people\ndie every year.\nDanny Dorling has done a lot of\nwork on the deaths caused by cars.\nHe showed that the ratio of men to\nwomen dying between the ages of 20\nand 30 has hit an historical high. It is\ngreater than the World Wars, and that\nthis is a consequence of car deaths.\nCar deaths are the single biggest killer of the under 35s, and for people\nof undergraduate age, cars account\nfor nearly half of the non-medical related deaths. These deaths are completely pointless and Danny Dorling\nrefers to cars as the open sewers of\nCar Sick: Why we need to\nreclaim our streets\nLuke Sheldon\nBob Marley caused a smog on the M25 last week\nThe news that the management training\ncompany Coalescence Consulting has\nreceived payments of \u00a339,570 this financial year may raise a few eyebrows. While\nMark Davies, Chief Executive of the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, has\nstated that, \u201cOn joining Imperial I rightly\ndeclared an interest in the company and\nresigned as a director of Coalescence to\navoid any issues of a conflict of interest.\nI have had nothing to do with the commissioning of any work historic or ongoing,\u201d\nhe remains a Senior Consultant and Executive Coach for the company, with his\nwife in the position of Managing Director.\nNot only is the issue of conflicts of interest at best not entirely clear, but in the\ncurrent economic climate and continuing financial instability, it is fair to ask\nwhether it is appropriate for a company to\ncontinue to pay out large sums of money\nfor what are described as \u201cinnovative,\nbespoke organisational development services for health and social care, to help\nyou, your team and your organisation succeed\u201d on the Coalescence website. The\nintrinsic value of such courses should be\nthoroughly determined and subsequently\nreviewed.\nThe Imperial College Healthcare NHS\nTrust is facing a budget deficit in excess\nof \u00a335m and there have been strong allegations that St Mary\u2019s may close as part\nof a cost saving exercise, despite protestation from senior figures.

    "content": "GAMES\nBrained by a purple dildo\nJonathan Wang talks about Volition Inc.\u2019s latest offering Saints Row: The Third\u2019s\nattempts to not just eclipse the GTA franchise, but to beat it into the dust. With a\ndildo bat\nGames Editor: Laurence Pope\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cFarts in a jar used as gas\ngrenades\u201d\nT\no someone who has never heard of\nSaints Row before, there's only one\ncomparison you can make, so I\u2019ll get\nit out of the way: it\u2019s like Grand Theft\nAuto. The behemoth that is Rockstar\nStudios\u2019 third-person, driving-shooting free-roam\nfranchise single-handedly created a new genre and\nalso influenced a whole slew of games over the last\ndecade. However, whilst rival studios were taking\nnote and adopting some of the successful elements\nof GTA, whether it\u2019s the driving or the shooting or\nthe open city, Volition was taking notes. Like scientists citing and Kanye sampling, Volition knew\nthat the better the original source, the more you\nshould put in.\nOf course, Volition didn\u2019t just copy the ingredients \u2013 they also improved the recipe. Saints Row:\nThe Third is like GTA IV. On acid. This genre requires two important things done right: combat and\nvehicles. Saints Row doesn\u2019t just do them right, it\ndoes them fun.\nTo start, you\u2019re given the standard controls: left\nand right shoulder buttons for punches, one button pulls out your gun menu, and an every button which ranges from grabbing people to use as\nhuman shields, to commandeering cars by diving\nthrough their windows.\nThere is already a lot of havoc that can be\nwrecked on foot. Running up to people and pressing punch pulls off a variety of wince-worthy vio-lence. The standard bare-fisted attack is a punch or\na kick to the groin. It gets worse (or should that be\nbetter?) from there. Giant fists that make punched\npeople explode into a fine red mist, farts in a jar\nused as gas grenades, and most infamously of all,\nthe Penetrator: a giant, purple, rubber phallus stuck\nover a baseball bat that swings about limply, are all\navailable to be picked up. Other ridiculous methods\nof bringing death to your enemies include calling\nin airstrikes and launching them from manapults.\nThere\u2019s even a rocket launcher that makes enemies\ndance like Michael Jackson before they spontaneously combust.\nNaturally, the designs are just as ludicrous when\nit comes to vehicles. Fighter jets with heat seeking\nmissiles are casually parked in allotments and, at\nsome point, you can drive a moon buggy through\nthe streets. However, my favourite has to be the\nSpecter: flashy, high-speed hover bikes with machine guns that can barrel roll, a Godsend in such\na large setting. The vehicles are also much sturdier\nthan their GTA counterparts, encouraging a more\naggressive driving style. Whilst there are occasional traction issues the overall handling is tight and\neasy to pick up.\nThe insane amount of character customisation is\nalso on show. Enter a plastic surgery parlour and\nits possible to change every part of your body and\nclothing, with the character models good enough to\nmake this exercise worthwhile. In addition, choosing to wear outlandish costumes can earn you Respect, the game\u2019s XP equivalent.\nAfter having fun, earning Respect and money is\nLooks like someone forgot the safeword\nthe next priority. The former can be spent on upgrading your skills, the latter on purchasing prop-erty, weapons and character modifiers. Both can be\nearned through completing various Activities and\nDiversions, which number one fewer than Heinz\nhas varieties, guaranteeing that the chances of getting bored is slim. Respect can also be earned by\ndoing what you like; yes, running down pedestrians on your hover bike is commended.\nThe setting this time is Steelport, a fictional city\nbased on Chicago and Detroit, where the Saints are\ntop of the food chain: they even having their own\nmascots and a line of energy drinks. This fame allows the player to get away with all sorts of hijinks.\nIn fact, this unconventional initial scenario is an\nexcuse for making a lot of items and, by implica-tion, fun, accessible before completing missions.\nWe also meet our primary antagonists, The Syndicate, a multinational conglomerate of gangs,\nwhen the Saints inadvertently raid a Syndicate\nbank in mission one. Cue the first insane set piece.\nYou're throw out of the back of the plane, and,\nwhilst falling, fighting off skydiving gangsters and\ndodging debris and the plane, you also rescue your\ngirlfriend. If that doesn't make you want to play the\ngame I don't know what will.\nThe GPS system, which directs you along the\nshortest route on your mini map, makes a successful return, as does the ability to restart failed\nmissions immediately after failing. The Notoriety\nsystem is also much more forgiving than GTA's\nWanted system, exchanging realism for the freedom to do what you want.\n\u201cSaints Row: The Third\nexchanges realism for the\nfreedom to do what you\nwant\u201d\nNevertheless, it\u2019s not all good news. There are\nsome minor criticisms of the game, one of which is\nthe dialogue. Voice acting can be occasionally flat\nand the humour can at times come across as immature or a little forced. The enemies are also not\nparticularly smart, forgoing cover and embracing\nrush tactics. These are the only foibles I've come\nacross in the short time I've been playing, but they\ndon\u2019t detract from my recommendation.\nMultiplayer modes from earlier games have also\nbeen dropped in favour of a more polished single\nplayer, but the co-op mode remains: a friend can\ndrop into any point in your story to help you out.\nI don't know many many times I've reiterated\nthis, but SR:TT is FUN. The sandbox setting\nmeans you choose how, where, and when you have\nfun, and who with. In a game world where even the\nskyline can be altered, the choices and possibilities\nseem endless.\nSaints Row: The Third sets itself apart by allowing you to offend your own sensibilities in\nevery way you can imagine. It\u2019s a game full of\nbright colours and Tarantino violence, a world of\nLuchadores gangs and dildo bats. It\u2019s immensely\nimmature, terribly unsubtle, and totally over the\ntop but, nonetheless, it\u2019s fun in its purest form.\nFELIX\n36 Friday 18 november 2011\nDid you know nuclear power produces no CO2\nand is half as expensive and 99% less polluting than coal-burning power? \u2013 GREEN WEEK 2011\n\n"

It doesn\u2019t have all the\nteams in it yet, as some of you haven\u2019t played yet...but will\nbe updated every week.\nThe Imperial Immortals American Football\nteam stormed through for another victory this\nSunday with a hard fought battle against the\nRoyal Holloway Bears. At their last meeting\nthe Bears had won by the closest of margins\n(scoring a field goal in 3rd overtime) so the\nImmortals stepped on the field with something\nto prove. With the momentum of last weeks\nwin behind them the Immortals finished the\ngame with their first shut-out of the season\nand a well earned 19 points.\nThe first half went very well for the Immortals, receiving the kickoff and driving the ball\nup the field repeatedly with power running by\nTino Millar; breaking a number of tackles and\ncarrying two of the Bears Linebackers into\nthe endzone to score the first touchdown of\nthe game. However, there were moments that\nthe Immortals struggled against some powerful players, needing to make long yards on\nthird down. With the weather perfect the team\ncould turn to its passing game; Michael Peacock making an important catch in the Bears\nred zone to ensure first down. The catch of the\nday however came just before the half, with\nthe Immortals Quarterback Bob Wolstenholme having plenty of time to throw a 40\nyard pass to rookie Wide Receiver Max Hollister who was free to run it to the endzone for\nthe last score of the half.\nThe Surrey offense struggled all game; having a number of players injured by the hard\nhitting Immortals defense. Not only were the\nBears unable to keep the Defense away from\ntheir quarterback, any completed pass or run\nwas shut down quickly by fast pursuit and\nquality tackling. To top off their awful half,\nthe Bears second choice Quarterback, under\npressure from rushing lineman Temi Ladega,\nthrew a lofted pass straight into the arms of\nwaiting linebacker Dexter Valencia who returned for the first defensive touchdown in\nImmortals history. With the Surrey offense\npushed back to their touchdown line after\nkick-off, Imperial hopes for a safety (sacking\nthe quarterback in their own endzone) were\ndashed when the half was called and a downcast Holloway team stumbled off the field\nwith the score at 19-0.\nHowever in the second half Royal Holloway\nstepped up their game. The Immortals clearly\nwere suffering from over-confidence as the\noffense seemed lackluster; failing to drive the\nball repeatedly and having to punt a number\nof times. Meanwhile the Holloway defense\nshowed aggression and fought incredibly hard\nfor every tackle, with a solid effort to try and\npull Holloway back into the game. Even with\nthis Imperial still came close to scoring again;\nuntil Bob Wolstenholme threw yet another ill-conceived pass straight into the arms of a Holloway Linebacker. Thankfully he was tackled\nto the ground immediately before any yards\ncould be made. The defense maintained their\ndominance throughout the second half, with\nHolloway losing their Centre due to injury it\nwas even easier for the Immortals to blow-up\nany potential running plays in the Holloway\nbackfield. In fact, this game had the highest\nnumber of interceptions and turnovers as the\nImmortals forced the Bears to keep making\nmistakes. Veteran Cornerback George Barnes\nmaking a fantastic interception but was unable\nto run it in to the Bears endzone due to age and\nlack of pace.\nIn the final quarter of the game Holloway\nrealized they had been thoroughly beaten and\ninstead turned to poor sportsmanship. Unfortunately resorting to poor play and questionable behavior in an attempt to force the Immortals to their level. Thankfully, the Imperial\nteam remained calm and played the football\nthey wanted to play; finishing the game with\na shut-out.\nThe game was incredibly hard fought but\nthe team look forward to their game next Sunday against the Reading Renegades.

    "content": "FOOD food.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFood Editors: Anastasia Eleftheriou\nMichael Krestas\nCampus Food Review\nThe fast food section of the JCR hasn\u2019t got much in the\nway of variety. Sandwiches run out really early (I can\u2019t find\nany good ones by 13:00) and the Sushi should have more\nchoices: they could introduce single options like wasabi.\nThe pasta section really should have better options and borrow some of Pret A Manger\u2019s ideas (such as bacon, cheese,\nham, tomato, and chocolate croissants). The \u2018Create-yourown\u2019 section needs improvement too, like having toasted\nsandwiches and more in the meat section (where is bacon\nand melted cheese?). The pancakes and panini section \u2013\nthe best in my opinion \u2013 has some good options, though the\nbiggest problem for me is the fact that the JCR closes way\ntoo early. Everybody knows when the time for a pancake is\n\u2013 just after finishing your lecture at 4! Overall, the JCR just\ncan\u2019t compete with a street shop in its category, due to the\nmedium quality, taste, and the lack of options. 4/10\nKyriakos Ioannou\nVariety is queen, and the Queens Tower Restaurant appears to be worthy of its royal name. At a\nuniversity as international as ours, a mixed plate\nis a necessity, and our restaurant seems to provide just that. The Chinese noodles, for instance,\nare a must-try for those who have not yet had the\nfortune of tasting culinary masterpieces from the\nEast. With curries served daily and Italian meals\nalso regularly in the mix, the restaurant has an\ninternational feel that makes it an indispensable\npart of every student\u2019s lunch time. To top it off, the\nclassic meal deal \u2013 a drink, main dish, and soup or\ndessert \u2013 makes it an affordable lunch.\n7/10\nDuring irregular hours, our pseudo around-the-clock Library Caf\u00e9 can be a life saver. Whether it\u2019s\nshortly before morning lectures and you just what\nto grab a quick coffee, or late in the evening after\nlong hours in labs, the caf\u00e9 gives you just what\nyou need: quick food. But beware: while service is\nswift during off-peak hours, the queues that form\nduring lunch time or exam season can be a frustrating experience. Thankfully the caf\u00e9 seems to\nhave acknowledged this and now has opened a\nnew third till.\n5/10\nFresh Deli. Fried chicken. Burgers. Pancakes. It\u2019s a\ncomplete assortment that you rarely see so close\ntogether anywhere in South Kensington. The Fast\nFoods Corner definitely doesn\u2019t offer the healthiest of choices, but it\u2019s undeniably tasty. The delicacies produced by our star chef at the fast foods\ncorner could easily rival those from Burger King or\nKFC. My favourite food in the JCR, however is the\nfreshly made sandwiches at the Deli Bar. Despite\nlong queues that form at the Deli Bar, when I\u2019m in\nno rush to get to a lecture, I try to drop by the bar\nto pick and choose the contents of my own custom sandwich. Subway lovers, this is just better.\n7/10\nMario Hayashi\nExpert\u2019s View\nJunior Common\nRoom\nThe quality of food in the JCR is high; I often have the Fish\nand Chips for lunch. However, I feel the variety can be improved on: more hot food, such as pasta, could be available.\n7/10\nYong Zi Tan\nOn the one hand, you can find a variety of different foods;\nfrom salads tofresh sandwiches, sushi to crepes. The members of staff are polite and they are very quick at the ca-shiers. It\u2019s also a cozy place with nice, comfortable couch-es. On the other hand, it gets very crowded and is therefore\nnoisy at around midday. I think this might happen because\nthere is not enough space to accommodate everyone. Prices are reasonable and overall I consider the JCR as a place\nto grab something that I can eat elsewhere, unless it is not\npeak time. 6/10\nIoannis Kourouklides\nFrankie says RELAX!\nI have had various meals in the JCR, including sandwiches\nfrom the Delhi bar and the other places. I have to say, I\u2019m\nrather impressed at the quality of the food as I expected it\nto be much worse! For about \u00a35 you have a wide choice of\nfull meal combinations at the cafeteria, much needed during\nthe course of the day, and the various sandwiches available\nare fresh and prove ideal if you don\u2019t have the time to sit\ndown and eat. The food should be able to satisfy most of\nthe students since it ranges from common foods to Italian\nand Chinese. 7.5/10\nMichalis Michaelides\nThe JCR is okay. I do really like the sandwiches, especially\nthe make-your-own counter \u2013 I always go with the freshly\nmade baguette with cheddar cheese, tomato and pesto. The\ncoffee is fine, the variety of drinks is very good and sofas are\nrelaxing! 7/10\nAnastasia Eleftheriou\nScouring South Kensington for the ultimate in College\ncuisine \u2013 who will triumph in this war of gastronomy?\nFELIX\n40 Friday 18 november 2011\nRainforests higher than 3,000ft above sea level are called cloud forests \u2013 GREEN WEEK 2011\n\n"

He ensnares her despite his inability to satisfy her physical needs and\nprovide her with children, all the while\nusing her own naivety to convince her\nshe is the source of her own problems,\neventually driving her to despair in her\nchildlessness and visit a crazy voodoo\nlady who lives under a tree in search of\na solution. Hmm. Actually, on reflec-tion, maybe not. But it\u2019s this transformation from darling bud to withered\nflower that forms the spine of Lorca\u2019s\ntragic play Yerma and whilst her character at the end may be pretty far from\nanyone you know, the character at the\nstart is very familiar.\nBrought this week to the Gate Theatre\nin conjunction with the Hull Truck, a\ncast of five present a new stripped down\nproduction of one of Lorca\u2019s most incendiary plays. Yerma tells of a doting\nyoung girl\u2019s desperate efforts to have\nchildren in the face of her uninterested\n(presumably arranged) husband Juan.\nMarried off young with little worldly\nwisdom and living in the barren Spanish outback, Yerma\u2019s life consists of\nlittle more than wifely duties and banal\nconversations with neighbour, Maria.\nEven these sour as Maria herself becomes a mother and the still childless\nYerma a bad omen according to local\nsuperstition. Torn between her irrepressible maternal desires and the need\nto socially conform, Yerma is finally\ndriven to clandestine means of impregnation and, when revelations surface\nregarding her husband and an amorous\nchildhood friendship, she driven to unspeakable acts.\nIt says a great deal of our modern\nsensibilities that the two main objections to Lorca\u2019s play on its publishing\nseventy years ago \u2013 namely its negative\nportrayal of Catholicism and discussion\nof homosexuality \u2013 would today cause\nhardly a murmur of discontent. All this\ncommends the efforts of the production to modernize the piece. In reducing the piece down, a stark intensity is\nbrought to the mundane conversation\nthat constitutes the most revealing parts\nof the play. Played with a gentle innocence by Ty Glaser, Yerma\u2019s tragedy is\nall the more painful and her unworldly\nnature emphasized opposite Alison\nO\u2019Donnell\u2019s earthy humour in the role\nNext time I\u2019ll Sing to You is currently being staged at the Orange Tree Theatre in\nRichmond until the 10 December. Written by James Saunders in 1962 it has\nrecently been revived by the theatre he\nhad such a close involvement during his\ncareer. It is remembered mostly today\nas the play which saw Michael Caine\u2019s\nWest End debut as Meff when it was first\nstaged at the Arts Theatre. As a story it, it\nis based around five characters planning\na play about the real life story of a hermit\nwho spent the last 36 years of his life in\nisolation before dying in 1942. As well\nas loosely telling the story of Alexander\nJames Mason, the Great Cranfield Hermit, it involves the 5 characters bouncing\naround various topics covering questions\nof death, identity and their own exis-tence; mostly with irony and humour. In\nparticular, whether, as the hermit had not\nbeen seen for such a long period of time,\nit can be said he really existed at all.\nIts plot is deeply absurdist, the flow of\nwhich is not the easiest to follow to begin\nwith, but it utilises the divergences from\nthe background storyline to articulate the\nmajor existentialist themes very well. Despite its age, the skilfully crafted dialogue\nand blend of surreal humour with philosophical crisis stands up well to time.\nOnly on occasions does it come across as\ndated, oddly in the parts where there is\nan obvious attempt to update the dialogue\nfor the modern audience, such as the reference to Strictly Come Dancing which\ndidn\u2019t really fit. The delivery of the play\nwas very good, with all the actors playing their parts impeccably resulting in a\nproduction that captivated the audience\nas it progressed. In particular, I liked the\nperformances Jamie Newall put in as the\nactor playing the Hermit and Holly Elmes as the ditzy Lizzie. As a venue, the\nOrange Tree Theatre is small and cosy\nwith the audience on all four sides of the\nstage, a set-up which works well and creates an absorbing experience.\nAll in all, it is in parts a challenging,\nweird play but one which is ultimately\ninvigorating, enjoyable and good fun.\nNext Time I\u2019ll Sing To You runs at the\nOrange Tree Theatre until December\n10\nof Maria.\nThe beauty of tragedy lies in the\ndescent \u2013 the slow and inavoidable\ndownfall of the tragic hero, whether\nit be Macbeth or Phaedra or Yerma.\nThis production crafted theirs well, the\ngradual turning of the screws layering\nthe plot with a polished finesse.

    "content": "SCIENCE\nIn brief\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nI\nt\u2019s officially official! The Earth is heating up. This is the conclusion of the most\nup-to-date and comprehensive study into\nrecent changes in Earth\u2019s land surface\ntemperatures. The Berkeley Earth Project (BEP), based at the University of California,\nwas developed by a group of climate scientists\nand statisticians in response to criticisms by climate sceptics of existing surface temperature\nrecords. The project combined over 1.6 billion\nmeasurements from the last two hundred years\nfrom over 39,000 weather stations globally, and\nutilised new statistical algorithms to integrate\nthe multiple fragmented data sets available from\nthe historical record. Their results reveal an 1\u00b0C\nincrease in average global temperature since the\n1950\u2019s, a conclusion that is supported by multiple existing temperature records produced by\nthe Met Office, NASA, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the\nClimate Research Unit (CRU) at the University\nof East Anglia.\nSo you may ask why is this news worthy,\nif the scientific community already knew the\nEarth was heating up? Well, unless you have\nhad your head stuck in a bucket over the last\nfew years, you will know that the climate science community has had a pretty rough time of\nit lately. Death threats, slander and the risk of a\nruined career are all possibilities climate scientists must face today. Despite an overwhelming\nconsensus held by the vast majority of climate\nscientists that the Earth is warming, there is still\na palpable disparity between this agreement and\nthe views held by a small but very vocal and\ninfluential group of climate change sceptics.\nNo one is resistant to their often overblown\ncriticism: the Nobel Prize winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which\nserves as a platform for climate scientists to\ncommunicate their findings in a format directly accessible to policy makers, politicians,\nbusiness leaders and the public, was heavily\ncriticised last year for accidentally including a\nsmall piece of literature in one of their reports\nthat had not been subjected to peer review. Another example of attack was the \u2018Climategate\u2019\n\u2018scandal\u2019 in 2009, when hackers released thousands of personal emails written by scientists\nbased at the CRU into the public domain. The\nemails were forensically analysed by climate\nsceptics for evidence of data manipulation and\nfalsification, causing a huge slew of global\ngovernmental inquires into climate science,\nand resulting in untold damage to the public\u2019s\nopinion of the field.\nSurface temperature records such as those\nproduced by the hacked CRU scientists have\nlong been an easy target for climate change\nsceptics \u2013 criticisms include data falsification,\nsample bias, large degrees of errors on temperature estimates, poor spatial coverage and increasing urban development. It is no small coincidence that some of the scientists involved\nin the BEP are considered as some of the most\nvocal climate change sceptics in the academic\nworld, with the project developed to address\nthese very concerns. The ultimate irony, there-fore, lies in the fact that despite the criticisms\nof existing records, the attempt to produce a\nmore \u2018robust\u2019temperature record has produced\nthe exact same results as the previous records.\nAnother possible issue is the BEP\u2019s decision\nto release their findings to the public before\nsubjecting them to peer review \u2013 they argue\nthat an open access wiki-style forum is better\nfor the scientific process than independent reviews by academic peers, an opinion that may\nbe more damaging to the robustness of their\nconclusions than they realise. Another less\npublicised concern, though bordering in the\nconspiracy realm, are questions being asked\nabout the motivations behind the funding\nGlobal warming is\nhappening, say sceptics\nCarys Cook on why the Berkley Earth Project is a step in the right direction\nsources of the BEP \u2013 in particular, the Novim\nGroup, a charitable NGO who funds the BEP\nand only one other research program investigating climate engineering in response to dramatic climate change.\nProfessor Sir Brian Hoskins, director of the\nGrantham Institute of Climate Change and a\nclimate change advisor to the government,\nagrees that the findings of the Berkeley Earth\nProject are not particularly groundbreaking:\n\u201cThe overall message \u2013 that by using a different technique the same answer is produced\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nI didn\u2019t commision this piece just so I could use a photo of baby polar bears. Honest\nFrog trade linked to killer fungus\nScientists have reason to believe that the global\ntrade in amphibians may have helped create and\nspread a deadly fungal disease. Dr Matthew Fisher,\nfrom the School of Public Health at Imperial College London, has led an international team of scientists in the inquiry of this issue. Their research\nhas shown that trade may have allowed non-lethal\nstrains of the chytrid fungus from different parts of\nthe world to come into contact with each other. This\ninteraction has lead to the formation of a new and\nlethal strain of chytrid fungus by a process called\nrecombination, and which may responsible for the\ndecline of the amphibian population.\nScientists are perplexed by the fact that some\namphibians are able to coexist alongside the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). In\nan attempt to trace the history of Bd, 20 samples\nof the skin-infecting fungus were isolated from 11\namphibian species worldwide and subsequently\nsequenced and compared. As the researchers had\nalready suspected, results yielded that there actually exists more than one type of strain of chytrid\nfungus. A total of three were found and the deadly,\nglobal panzootic lineage (GPL) was identified. Evidence of gene exchange was found in the hyperviru-lent BdGPL, which has made an appearance in at\nleast five continents so far. The fungus is responsible for the extinction of over 200 species of frogs,\ntoads, salamanders and newts and has caused\ninfections in North America, Central America, the\nCaribbean, Australia and Europe.\nExperts have been able to match the initial dip\nin the amphibian population around the 1970s\nwith the emergence of the amphibian trade. In one\nscenario, a captive breeding and reintroduction\nprogram attempting to boost numbers of an endangered Mallorcan midwife toad may have actually\nhelped spread Bd from captive African clawed frogs\nto toads. Despite widespread effort to understand\nthe emergence of chytrid fungus, many aspects of\nits existence still remain largely unknown. Dr Fisher\nstresses that to halt further spread of this lethal\ndisease there is urgent need to increase global bi-osecurity.

Without\ngetting into the philosophy behind the ensuring scientific rigour, there is no doubt that,\nby and large, independent review by peers is\nan excellent form of improving the quality of\nscientific publications. Professor Hoskins expressed some concern about the BEP\u2019s decision to hold back on subjecting their findings\nand methods to peer review before releasing\nthem into the public realm. \u201cAfter all of the\ncriticism of the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change, I am really surprised that\nthey have done this. I am sure that most academics feel that their papers are improved\nthrough the formal and informal peer review\nprocess and I do not think we should circumvent this.\u201d He agreed that whilst it is possible\nthat the closed-off nature of the peer review\nprocess can damage the public\u2019s perception of\nclimate change research, the reaction should\nnot be to get rid of it. \u201cIt is healthy for climate\nscience to be treated in a sceptical manner: like\nall science it should be continually probed and\ntested. Hopefully this work will help us move\non to discuss the really challenging science of\nclimate variability and change and the implications of it. However the basic notion that we are\nperforming a very dangerous experiment with\nour planet now seems very difficult to refute.\u201d\nWhilst it seems that sceptics can now finally\nagree with the scientific community that the\nEarth is indeed warming dangerously, they\nstill have many questions that they feel remain\nunanswered, such as whether rising greenhouse gas emissions are in fact causing climate change. Time is running out to convince\nthe world that this is the case, and despite its\nfoibles and motivations, programs like the\nBEP are certainly a step in the right direction.\n\u201c\nThe ba\nThe b\nwe are\nwe are\nThis isn\u2019t what we meant by Green Week...\nFELIX\n8 Friday 18 november 2011\nThe energy saved by recycling a single aluminum can is enough to run a TV for three hours \u2013 GREEN WEEK 2011\n\n"

The\nstudent cuts protests were genuinely intimidating so I haven\u2019t attended recently.\nWhy do you feel the need to protest?\nI feel it is another way to express your opinion in a democratic society, where other\nmechanisms of getting your voice heard,\nsuch as writing to your local MP, feel like\nthey are getting nowhere.\nDo you think the protests regarding the\nchanges to the current student finance\nsystem so far have achieved anything?\nI think they have allowed people to express\ntheir genuine outrage at an elitist system\nthat will harm the lower middle classes\nopportunities of higher education, which is\nimportant. But I also feel they have been\ncounterproductive in that they have been\ninfamous for violence and general idiotic\nbehaviour by the minority of people.\nDo I think the current government will\nchange their minds about the increasing fees over the protests? Not unless it\nproves to be economic for them.\nWhy do you think that Imperial is politically inactive compared to other universi-ties?\nI read recently that scientists, and male\nscientists in particular, are less likely to\ndisplay empathy than the general popula-tion. (From Matt Ridley\u2019s, Nature via nur-ture) A lack of empathy could lead to apathy\non issues that do not directly affect you,\nand so I think imperial students are often\nfrom privileged backgrounds where cuts on\neducation or rising food prices due to climate change won\u2019t affect them.\nI also think it has become unfashionable,\nother ways of expressing annoyance are pre-ferred. And of course everyone is very busy\nand stressed.\nDo you think that Imperial should in fact\nbe more active and whose responsibility is\nthat?\nI don\u2019t think people should be forced to pro-test, I think people should care about the\nissues at hand and so use their initiative to\ngo to protests, if they feel the issues would\nbenefit from that sort of complaint. Maybe\nits society\u2019s responsibility to shape future\ngenerations to be less indifferent? Although\nI\u2019m not trying to say that not protesting\nmakes you indifferent.\n\u201cThey have allowed people to express their genuine outrage at an elitist\nsystem that will harm\nthe lower middle classes\nopportunities of higher\neducation, which is important.\u201d\nThe week before I started my first year\nhere I went to the Fresher\u2019s Fair at Queen\u2019s\nUniversity Belfast, my local. Going to Imperial\u2019s the week after was a more or\nless similar affair \u2013 the same hobbies\nand sports, the same international societies and charities. But one thing stood\nout as missing \u2013 where was the political\nLeft? Unlike Queen\u2019s with its range of left\nwing groups all vying for attention, singing revolutionary songs and pronouncing\non student fees and corporate greed, this\nfledgling physicist saw just two people\nquietly manning a Socialist Workers stall,\nnestled uncomfortable between stalls\nfrom the various investment banks and oil\ncompanies we all know and love on cam-pus. The Left, it seemed, had left. The\nquestion is \u2013 has it ever been here? Is\nImperial naturally conservative?\n\u201cOne thing stood out as\nmissing \u2013 where was the\npolitical Left?\u201d\nWe certainly aren\u2019t socially conserva-tive. Imperial was ranked by LGBT rights\ngroup Stonewall as the most gay-friend-ly university in the UK and if anything is\nstopping students from availing of the\nfreely distributed condoms around campus it\u2019s the infamous \u201cratio\u201d, not old- fashioned morals.\nBut while we may be generally apathetic,\nwhen we do get political are we, as a student body, quite right-wing? This seemed\nto be the case last year when Imperial College Union spoke out on the Brown Review\nof tuition fees. This made them no different to any other students\u2019 union except\nfor one thing- they spoke out in favour of\nthe fees. So did Felix. Brown was in favour\nof uncapped fees, a move that even the\nConservative-led coalition government opposed and yet our union, a lone island in\na sea of student union outrage, backed\nthem.\nBut how representative of its students\nwas ICU\u2019s decision? From the Union\u2019s own\nsurvey at the time of the Brown Report,\nwhile some 90% of students (including\noverseas students) supported some kind\nof fees, just 13% agreed with a fully un-capped system, as supported by their\nUnion. So it seems that the full extent of\nthe Union\u2019s stance was unrepresentative\nof its students. But it remains the case\nthat 90% of students agree with paying\nsomething for our time here, putting them\nsignificantly at odds with the majority of\nstudents nationwide.\nOf course the elephant in the room for\nsuch an issue is class \u2013 some would argue\nthat Imperial students are simply posher\nthan most and naturally lean towards conservatism to protect their vested interests.\nIt is certainly true that Imperial students\nare more privileged than most \u2013 some\n37% came here from private schools and\njust 2.9% qualified for free school meals,\ncompared to 7% and 5% respectively in the\ncountry. But Oxford and Cambridge with\ntheir famously privileged intake still have\nsignificant left wing groups and student\nprotest movements. And while, yes, the current Conservative leader went to Oxford, so\ndid the Labour leader. We\u2019re still no further.\n\u201c90% of students agree\nwith paying something\nfor our time here, putting them significantly at\nodds with the majority of\nstudents nationwide.\u201d\nSo how does this perceived right-wards\nshift fit with the idea that Imperial students\nare apolitical? The chair of Imperial\u2019s Conservative Society points out that \u201cconservatism as a movement and being a member\nof the political party are two vastly different\nthings\u201d. Viewed in this way, things start to\nmake more sense. Conservatives at Imperial aren\u2019t so much dyed-in-the-wool Tories as libertarians, \u201cconservatives with a\nsmall \u2018c\u2019\u201d in the words of the Conservative\nSociety chair. More philosophical than\npartisan. In fact it may well be that the\nrelatively calm political atmosphere here\nenables people to have opinions that in\nanother university would leave them os-tracized.\n\u201cSome would argue that\nImperial students are\nsimply posher than most\nand naturally lean towards conservatism to\nprotect their vested interests.\u201d\nIt would seem that IC student opinion\ntends to be shifted to the right of most\nother universities but there may be many\nreasons behind this. It could just be that\nmore than anything else, the calmer,\nmore tolerant political atmosphere simply\nallows for a wider exploration of different\nideas. A strange irony for such an apolitical place.\n\n"
