One company\nalone - Roberts Construction a South African\nconstruction company, - will be holding over\n20 interviewing sessions at Universities and\ncolleges to recruit graduates to work in\n.South Africa, in February this year. ,\nIn their information sheet for potential\napplicants Roberts Construction say \"Be-cause of the nature and scope of its operation it (Roberts Construction) is a highly\nintensive and a large industrial employer of\nmanpower, with over 42,000 employees. This\ndemands a moral and social responsibility\ntowards the community. South Africa is a multi-racial society and Roberts Construction has an obligation to endeavour to fulfill the aspirations of each racial group.\"\nWorthy sentiments ; but what are the real\nfacts behind this verbiage in Roberts Construction's glossy handout ; what is it really like for Black South African workers and\nwhat role do recruited 'immigrants' play in\nsupporting the Apartheid system?\nSouth Africa' s black workers are denied\nfundamental political rights and are subject\nto the most vicious exploitation which the\napartheid policy seeks to preserve and if\npossible extend .The denial of human and\npolitical rights combine with low wages and\nrepression of trade union organisation into a system that attempts to make near slaves of\na gigantic workforce and at the same time\nmaximise profits .\nAfrican workers are:\n* Excluded from many jobs by law -they are\nexcluded from skilled and in many cases,\nparticularly in the construction industry,\neven semi-skilled jobs by legislation, agreements between employers and white trade\nunions, by apprenticeships and by racist\ncustom.\n* Forced to carry passes at all times. The\nsystem of pass laws controls and regulates\nthe movement of every African in the white\nareas of South Africa, ie.86.3% of the co un try. The pass laws have been described as the tightest permit control system in the\nworld - in 1975 alone 387 thousand people\nwere prosecuted under these laws.* Forced to work as migratory labourers in\nthe land of their birth -the implementation\nof apartheid entails the ruthless removal from\nthe cities and other parts of white South\nAfrica of all Africans superfluous to the needs of the white economy . Those remaining\nin the cities and white areas have ab sol ut ely no political rights and the enormity of\nthese removals is on a scale approaching\nthose perpetrated by Nazi Germany in Euro pe -in 1974 2.5 million Africans had been\nremoved to the homelands. Migratory labourers work in the white areas on a contract\nsystem, their fam i lies must remain in the\nhomelands for this period, whilst they live\nin single sex hostels and they are forced to\nreturn to the homelands for long periods. In\neffect the homelands act as reservoirs of\ncheap labour and the African people have no\nright to choose where they live or work.\n* Denied the right to organise themselves -strikes are effectively illegal. Workers who\nattempt to organise trade unions are black-listed, sacked, banned, imprisoned and in\nthe case of 3 leading trade unionists in the\nlast 2 years detained and tortured to death\nby the South African police .\n* Paid poverty wages -despite the claims of\ninternational and South African companies\nwhich claim to act as agents of change,\nthe majority of the African work force are\npaid poverty wages. In the construction\nindustry in 1976 the average annual wage\ntor a white was R7.036 and for an African\nR1.380. Unemployment is exceptionally high.\nDespite these facts Roberts Construction\nand, of course, the many other companies\nwhich recruit skilled personnel at British\nUniversities claim that they endeavour to\nfulfill the aspirations of each racial group.\nThe facts contradict these statements and\nin fact it has been shown over many years\nthat these companies are willing allies with\nthe regime in sustaining a system which guarantees the highest per capita profit ratio\nin the world.\nThroughout the years the opponents of the\nboycott policy -those apologists for apartheid - have argued that it is better to build\nbridges with South Africa in order to have\ninfluence over apartheid. Once again the\ntruth is far removed.\n\"If this policy is effective why is there\nno indication of change. In fact the areas\nwhere some cosmetic changes have taken\nplace are in the areas where boycott strategy has been effective, ie sport. In addition\nto which, far from moving towards change,\nif anything the system of apartheid has become more intensive and is applied with an\never increasing ruthlessness.,\n* External links are links which in a very\ndirect way support the apartheid system. The\nrecruitment of skilled personnel to work in\nSouth Africa means that in the first place\nthese people join the many others who migrate to South Africa and reinforce the white\npower structure. They take with them expertise in many fields including the skills wh i' ch even the South Africa regime itself admits\nare necessary for it to build an independence\nand self sufficiency in case of international\neconomic sanctions, such as the arms and\nnuclear industry. In addition to which these\n\" immigrants\" no matter how well intention-ed they may be are quickly absorbed into\nthe white power structure - it is of course\nonly \"pure whites\" who are allowed to go.\nBlacks or people of mixed race will not be\nallowed to go.\nHence the proviso on the Roberts Construction hand out: \"All appointments are\nsubject to the immigration requirements\nbeing complied with and the necessary pre-m its obtained.\nWhite immigrants become enmeshed in all the structures of racist rule and are even\nforced by law to serve in the South African\narmy to defend Apartheid.\nWhilst over 20% of the active black population is unemployed and thousands more\nare being made redundant every day-white\nworkers are being recruited at British Universities to work in South Africa and to\nwork in South Africa and to fill jobs which\nblack South Africans may not fill by law.\n* The South African people, the organisations fighting apartheid and the liberation\nmovement has called for an economic, cultural, academic and sports boycott. They\nstate that they are committed to any policy\nwhich though it may in the short term bring\nsome minor increased hardships, contribute\nto the weakening of the system and assist their struggle.\nThe system of racial exploitation in South\nAfrica, because in the final analysis it means\nthe good life for whites and big profits for\nbusiness, attracts immigrants to South Africa like flies to a dung hill!

I will agree\nwith him that, in places, the art-i cle was not strictly correct and,\nfor this, I apologise to John and\nhis staff for any distress caused.\nHowever, I do feel that the spirit\nof what was written was essentially valid.; Both John Allen and Paul Johnson (Chairman of STOIC) have put\ntheir point of view in replies to\nour article which were printed in last week's issue of FELIX. T here are just two points that I. would like to make in response to\nthese.\nFirst, neither I nor IC Liberal Club treat FORWARD! as ' a joke*.\nIf other members of ICU choose\nto do so, then that is their pre-rog at ive, but I attempt to ensure\nthat the articles are generally\nboth stimulating and pertinent to\nstudents at Imperial College. Second, no member of ICU can\nplace themselves above criticism,\nespecially when they are involved\nin a club or society using a considerable amount of Union money.\nThat goes for myself as well as\nfor John Allen and Paul Johnson. The important point is that the\nright to criticise these people, be\nit favourable or unfavourable crit-ic is m, is upheld at all costs. Yours sincerely, Paul Fair b aim( Editor FORWARD! Chairman IC Liberal Club)\nDear Sir, - I am writing; with re ference to the article which app eared in last week'sF EL DC on\nthe subject of \"Welfare Day &\nSex\". In this article we find\nlisted several ways of avoiding\npregnancy, one of which, implied\nto be \" extreme\", is that of a bst in ance. It seems a pity that this\nparticular method should be re le gated to this \" extreme\" position\nconsidering the following : -It is100% effective (100% in\npractice.)\nThere' is no danger of side ef-fec ts. No cost is involved,\nNo medical advice is required\nand lastly, Those who use this method will suffer no guilt.\nIt is hardly surprising that abstention is so successful considering that this is God's standard\noutside marriage. It is also to be\nexpected that when we deviate\nfrom God's standards we shall\nencounter many of the problems\noutlined in this article. Yours faithfully,\nChris Rider - Physics I Dear Sir, - \" A Blow For ICU: G rowing Up!\" As you might realise\nthis is a composite of two headings which appeared in FELIX No.506 in the Welfare Supplement.\nMay I just make a few comments\non these two?\nConcerning *A Blow For ICU', \u2022\nthe article advertising welfare\nday went on to say: \" This week\nImperial College Union will plumb\nthe depths in its striving for publicity as it brings you ... 'The\ngreat condom blowing competition'.\nThe prize for humiliating yourself\nin public is a bottle of Whisky.\" I must say that the ingenious\nword structure of this advertisement was very good however one\nor two things need to be mention-ed. The fact that ICU is plumbing\nthe depths in its striving for pub-li city is very true, however It h ink it has plummeted too far! Tell me honestly, how many people at\nI.C. want to get into the public\neye because of 'Condom Blowing Competitions?! How would you\nreader and Editor like to go for\nan interview and be recognised\nas a student from the college\nwhere they have such com petit on s for publicity stunts?\nThe continuation of the advertisement is also true, but it does\nnot only humiliate the winner but\naffects every person at I. C.How can the Union put on such an\nevent which is going to affect\nevery single person at college\nwithout asking the students if\nthey want it? If this is the best\nICU can do I think we should abandon the idea of letting ICU get\ninvolved in the first place . Tell me if I'm wrong but I thought we l fare was for the good of people,\nnot to their detriment.\n\u2022Concerning the other article\n'Growing Up*, I have not seen the\nfilm so cannot comment on that\nbut I have had nearly 22 years of\ngrowing up 'experience', maybe\nyou've had more, then you might\nbe wiser arid be able to correct\nme if I'm wrong. In those years I learnt that growing up is being\nable to cope with and control new\nsituations as we encounter them.\nHowever many people seem to\nthink that we should not be guided by our mind but by our body\nand its desires. ;\nAfter reading the article on Welfare and Sex, which could have\nbeen a bit more discreet, I must\nsay that I hope not many people\nwill have the need of making use\nof it. Is sex the be all and end\nall of a relationship? Girls, and\nmay be some boys, is it nice to\ngo out with someone because\nthey want your body? Isn't it much\nmore wonderful to be loved for\nwhat you are, or has the word\nlove become so tainted to be un able to be used?\nDoesn't sex lead to guilt and\nnot happiness? God instituted sex\nto be within marriage, why have\nwe made such a mess of it? The\nBible puts it like this: \" Since man did not think it worthwhile\nto retain the knowledge of God,\n'He gave them over to a depraved\nmind, to do what ought not to be \u2022\ndone.\" God is the only One who\ncan satisfy the need that is deep\nwithin us, now to my thinking\nthis is good news and should be\ntalked about on welfare day. Judge\nfor yourself\nYours sincerely,\nStephen R. Lane\nDear Sir, - I would like to explain\nbriefly my reasons for challenging\nthe chair at the end of the last U, G,M, as many of the people I have spoken to since were al it tle confused as to the purpose of\nthis. A procedural motion had\nbeen proposed that the meeting\nmove to,a vote and accepted by\nthe Chairman. Although this is occasionally used at aU.G. M. it\nis not in fact one of the allowed\nprocedural motions. It is usually taken as meaning that the meeting\nvotes directly on whether they\nwish to vote on the matter being\ndiscussed at that time, which on\nthis occasion was an amendment\nto the housing motion. As the time\nwas then 14.25 it was likely that\nthe few remaining people at the\nmeeting would be in favour of moving directly to a vote. I felt that\nthere had been insufficient time\nto discuss the amendment and\nchallenged the Chairman's ruling\non acceptance of the procedural\nmotion intending to propose in stead that the question be adjourned to the next meeting, so the\ndiscussion could be continued.\nThe motion on housing is probably the most important to be\nplaced before aU.G. M. this year\nas it could directly affect all students who do not live at home.\nI strongly urge that members of\nthe Union do not allow a handful\nof people at an in quo rate Union\nmeeting make a decision on it.\nPaul F lect c herE lec Eng2 Dear Sir, - Miss K ear sey' s letter\nin FELIX Dec .15th has prompted\nme to clarify bell ringing arrangements at IC.Hi e Queen's Tower belongs to the Crown and not I.C.

Eng. 2\nSir,- Is it too much to ask, that\nthe organisers of Dinners and extracurricular lectures at the co un try's foremost scientific College, should be capable of co-ordinating\nevents so that Clashes are minim-is ed? Clearly, this is not too much if\none of the events is of sufficient\nprestige - for example Prof. Bradl ey' s inaugural lecture or Guilds D&D. Why then should we have\nto choose between a lecture on\nEinstein( As soc. Studies) or Pro\u00a3\nJohn Taylor lecturing on his version of Physics( Mopsoc) ? Worse,\nthough, is yet to come - turning to\nthe 9th of February in my dia i y,I find myself having to choose\nbetween dinners organised by Dramsoc, FELIX, and a* gain, Mopsoc.\n:Where will it end? Is it too much\nto ask that the bookings office in Sherfield should as a matter of\ncourse inform a society booking a lecture theatre of other lectures\nor talks on the same day? Would\nit also be too difficult for all societies to inform a specific Union officer of dates planned for dinners - provisional or definite and\nfor him, in return to keep that society informed of possible clashes,\nas they are notified to him? Sucha\na procedure is not difficult and\nthe lack of it merely puts us on a par with provincial Universities such as MIT and Melbourne, so\nplease, somebody, do it.\nYours faithfully,\nK.J. Fenning\nDear Sir, - As a relatively new\nmember of staff of this College, who has just had my bicycle st olen while it was chained to the\nrailings outside Mech. Eng.,I would like to appeal to any other\nvictims of bicycle-theft at Imperi al College to join me in protesting against the appalling lack of\nsafe bicycle parking facilities in the College, and the nonchalant\nattitude of security staff to this\nproblem.\nImperial College is notorious\nwith the local police for being an\neasy target for bicycle theft. With the high cost of fares and worsening transport services in Lon don, the bike is a cheap, clean\nand healthy alternative way to\ntravel.\nI suggest that bicycle parking\nfacilities outside or inside the\nCollege, supervised by an at ten dant, be provided.\nHow many staff and students\nbring bikes to the College each\nday? This substantial number of\npeople have a right to a safe\nplace to leave their bicycles at\nthe College.

Union Office.)\nCadmium Findings in Shipham - imperial's Role\nFor the villagers of Shipham in Somerset\nthe presence of large amounts of cadmium in\ntheir soil suddenly became a major talking\npoint when the Department of the Environment announced two weeks ago that it was\ngoing to carry out thorough medical examinations and test the soil and house dust in\nthe village.\nBut for scientists in Imperial College's Geology Department the flurry of activity\nand media attention was just a temporary\ndiversion in a research programme which\nhas been going on for many years.\nThe scientists concerned belong to the\nApplied Geochemistry Research Groups, a multi-disciplinary group including geologists, geo chemists, soil scientists and\nanalytical chemists. Founded in 1954 by\nProfessor J.S. Webb its aim is to research\nmethods and techniques of using geochemistry for mineral exploration, agri cul true, pollution and other aspects affecting the\ncommunity . About50 people are involved\nincluding 20 postgraduates research stu dents .\nAn important part of the Group'swot k over the last ten years has been the production of the \" Wolf son Geochemical Atlas of England and Wales\", under the direction\nof Professor Webb and funded by the Wolfson\nFoundation . Published by the Clarendon\nSubsequent research funded by the Natural\nEnvironment Research Council focused\nattention on the Mendip Hills where some\nsites were found containing large amounts cf\ncadmium. This work was followed by a programme funded by Rio Tinto Zinc to look at\nthe detailed distribution and dispersion of\ncadmium in selected ares. Part of this work\nwas directed to Shipham.\nCadmium Sources\nThere are three sources of cadmium cont a mind ation in so i Is: natural geological\nsources, present day industrial activity and\npast mining and smelting. Cadmium is always\nfound in conjunction with zinc. In the Shi pham area zinc ore, mainly calamine (zinc\ncarbonate), had been mined from Roman times\nto the end of the last century, and the IC\nresearchers found that part of the village\nhad been built on reclaimed mine workings. Alan Marples, then a postgraduate stu dent with the Group, mapped out the extent\nof the cadmium distribution in Shipham and\nestablished that its source was the old zinc\nmines. The amount of cadmium in the soil varied from about 30 to several hundred parts\nper million, compared with a national average of about one part per million. So far\nShipham is the only area where such high\nlevels of cadmium have been found.\nThese findings caused concern because\nPress in September 1978 it comprises region- cadmium is a toxic metal capable of ca us al geo chemical maps showing the distribution of 21 metals over England and Wales.\nIt is the first publication of its kind. Work on the maps started in 1969 with the\ncollection of 50,000 stream sediment\nsamples at an average density of one per\nsquare mile. Subsequent research by the\nGroup has been concerned with the presentation of the maps and their interpretation\nfor a variety of applications. Among these\nare the study of trace elements for agri cul ture, and applications in water resources\nmanagement, pollution studies and public\nhealth. One of the metals mapped was cadmium.\ning disease and even death if ingested in\ns malI quantities. Cadmium contamination\ncaused an outbreak of a serious disease\nknown as itai-t tai in Japan between 1962\nand 1968. This condition is characterised\nby painful joints and brittleness of the bones\nIt can lead to the collapse of the skeleton\nand death.\nThe level of cadmium present in Shipham\nsoils is higher than that found in Japan but\nno cases of itai-itai are known to have occurred. There are several environmental differences between Japan and Shipham which\ncould account for this. In the case of Shi pham it is thought that little of the cadmium\nis taken up from the soil into grass and vegetables. The presence of zinc may hinder\nthe uptake of cadmium into plant roots. In\nJapan, on the other hand, cadmium was taken up by rice growing on the contaminated\nflood planes, which constituted one of the\nstaple items of the local diet.\nFurther Research\nThe Applied Geochemistry Research Group is continuing to work in Shipham. Hilary\nMatthews, a postgraduate, is carrying out an\nin-depth study of the forms of cadmium contamination, and a postdoctoral research assistant is working on the effects of cadmium\non nitrogen-fixing bacteria in agricultural\nsoils. It is expected that Imperial College\nwill also be involved in the survey of soil and house dust announced by the Department\nof the Environment.\nDr. Ian Thornton, Reader in Environmenta\nChemistry, is responsible for the Group's environmental programme and has borne the\nbrunt of the sudden public interest in the\nresearchers' findings. He has been on the\nreceiving end of a stream of 'phone calls from the media ever since the 1,200 Shi pham villagers were urged to stop eating vegetables grown in their gardens and give up\nheavy smoking. Smoking is considered dangerous as all smokers absorb a small amount\nof cadmium from tobacco anyway. Dr. Thorn ton emphasises that the high level of cadmium in the soil is a cause for concern but\nnot alarm. He considers that a thorough scientific study of the villagers' environment\nand health is needed.\nThe villagers themselves appear not to\nbe unduly alarmed. First indications are\nthat nobody has suffered from serious cadmium poisoning and villagers point out that\nmany of them have lived to a ripe old age.\nThey appear to be more concerned about the\neffect of the scare on property values and\nare rather annoyed at the way the affair has\nbeen publicised by the media.\nSonia Hochfeider\n\n"

However, it is rumour-ed that Ian Morton is currently\nengaged in negotiations with Buck\n-ingham Palace to book a starter'\nfor the final league race in 2!4\nweeks time,\ni David Rosen RUGBY\nI.C. Ist 3\nKings Ist 4\nFirst of all apologies for forgetting to write up this match in last week's FELIX. However it was a blessing in disguise because It gives me a match to report this\nweek! Due to the weather conditions each\nof our last three games has been cancelled,\nwith the next match also looking doubtful.\nAnyway we jumped in the coach for the\nabove match (a couple of weeks ago now)\nand duly arrived at Collier's Wood. To most\npeople's surprise the pitch was in relatively\ngood condition though there was a cold wind\nblowing (yes - even \" tough\" rugby players\ncringe at the thought of cold fingers etc.)\nWith the match underway Kings were on\nthe attack but failed to find their way to the\nLine due to some good covering play from\nI.C. Every ten minutes or so saw I.C. putting\ntogether a good three-quarter movement thus\nputting us back into their half. It was all to\nno avail though and Kings finally scored\nafter a mistake near our Line led to a scrum-mage five yards out.\nIn the second-half I.C. began to put things\ntogether but found, as Kings had earlier,\nthat actually scoring was not so easy.\nAnyway, to end a boring account-of an\nequally boring match we finally scored a penalty goal from Eddy Budgen. (The truth\nof It is that I can't remember much of what\nhappened!)\nTomorrow see sI.C. playing against Saracens in the morning then off to Twickenham\nin the afternoon for the International - so even if the match is called off again, I.C. rugby will be sending a team to an International -not bad eh!\nSponsored Wall-wash\nValentine's day is the day for I.C. R.F.C's sponsored 24-hour wall-wash in the Union\nBuilding and as a result 25 or so big fell as are wandering around looking for sponsors.\nIf they nab you please_( for your own safety)\nsponsor them.\nHalf the money raised will be going to\nRag and the other half to help pay for transport costs on our Easter Tour. (Southport by\nthe way -what do you mean where's that!)\nSidestep Townsend\n- even acer sportswriter than Llam Gartside!\nTEN TORS\nAs some of the more observant members\nof RCS will know, for the past three years\nthe RCSU has entered at least one team in\nthe annual ' Ten Tors' event.\n'Ten Tors' is essentially a matter of Pitting oneself against the clock,in an attempt\nto cover a specified course across the was*\nes of Dartmoor..\nThe name of the event, which is organised\nand marshalled by the Army, derives from the\nfact that all the participating teams must\nvisit ten checkpoints, situated upon Tors\n(rocky outcrops), regardless of which route\nis followed. These checkpoints are manned\nby the army, who keep a keen eye on the two\nthousand or so participating young men and\nwomen, using radio sets to pass on information to the team managers at HQ., and to\norder helicopters to recover the inevitable\noccasional casualty. This year R CSU has applied to enter 3\nteams: 2 men's teams, and 1 woman's. Only\nby virtue of our success in former years are\nwe able to enter the event at all, since competition for entry gets fiercer every year.\nThe two men's teams will by doing fifty\nfive mile routes, whilst the girls will do a thirty five mile route. Every team starts at\n7 D0 am on Saturday, and must have finished\nor stopped by about 5.00 pm on the Sunday.\nSaturday night is spent camping out on the\nmoor, so that it is vital for everyone to have\ntaken absolutely everything with them, that\nthey need for survival on the moor.\nNo one who has taken part in Ten Tors\nwould pretend that it was a holiday - it can\nbe incredibly tiring, especially for the soles\nof the feet. (It has even been known for certain persons to have been carried to the\nnearest bar at nights for days afterwards).\nHowever, for anyone who enjoys fell walk ing, camping, and the challenge of the moor,\nthis is an event not to be missed. There are no prizes, since there are no\nwinners, but the feeling of satisfaction\nafterwards makes it all worthwhile. Commemorative medals are awarded to all those\nwho complete the course, and should a complete team make it all the way round, they\nreceive a certificate.\nTodate, we have only managed to win one\nsuch certificate, thanks to last year's girls! So - if any of you budding RCS persons\nfancy the idea of taking part this year, there\nwill be a meeting on Monday 5th February\nabove Stan's bar, starting between 7.00 -7.30 pm. You may be interested to know that three\nof the last three RCS Presidents have reach\n\u2022ed that dizzy height via a place in a Ten\nTor team!\nGraham Bunn\nRCSU\nWater\nPolo\nOn Sunday 21st IC played their first match\nof the term against Walton Water Polo Club.\nThe team had not been able to practise -due to the pool not being heated and were\ntherefore rather unfit. After confusion with\ntransport we did arrive at the Walton Pool\nwith twelve willing players.\nIn the first quarter we showed our superior experience and with accurate passing were able to set up some good shots at goaL\nPaul Hindle scored our first and Dave Dun stone followed that up with a powerful shot\nafter swimming up the centre of the pool.\nThe score was put up to 4:0 with two goals\none from Steve Taylor and another from Da\\e. In the second quarter Paul got another goal\nwith a good shot from \" midfield\". Dave got\nanother two to make his total up to four.\nWalton tried very hard to push tip and score,\nbut due to tight marking they were unable to\nbreak free, and when they did Dave Roberts\nour goalie saved some good shots. In the\nthird quarter no goals were scored, in the\nfourth Tony Rockingham got our last goal\nto make the final score 8:0 to us. Tearrf :S. Tayler, F. Hindle, D. Dunstcne,\nC. Spooner, T. Rockingham P. Mills, N. Buck land, I. Spooner, D. Roberts, B.i Bradley D. Chadwick, M. Cherry.\nOn Tuesday 23r dI.C. first team played\nits first game in the U.L. U. League against\nMarys.\nWe didn't get off to a very good start.\nDuring our warm up before the game Brian Davies, our goalie, got his finger d is loc a ted by a shot at goal. He was therefore unable to play and we were left without a goalie.\nIn the first quarter,play went back and\nforward up the pool until Marys scored the\n!first goal. I.C. broke back and Dave Duns it one was awarded a penalty, which he got.\n! Marys came back and scored another before\nI the end of the quarter.\nIn the second quarter Dave Dunstone got\nhis second goal after a lucky pass. Marys\nscored again and in the third quarter they\nscored another. Tony Rockingham scored\n; our last goal after breaking from his man.\ni ln the final quarter Marys scored three,\neach getting past our substitute goalies\nwithout much difficulty! The final score was\n17:3 jo Marys. I Team: S. Tayler, D. Dunstone, P. Mills, T.I Rockingham, M. Casey,N. Buckland, B. Br-ad ley., iD. Papaconstantinou, (B. Davies).\n\n"

Cheers,\nstill vacant - papers remain up , Mike Elkin\nuntil somebody stands and for 3 E.C. Cushion ( A NAG) Mary's Mutterings\nAs Mike explained what the job of Honorary Secretary entails in\nlast week's issue, I thought j'd better not be outdone .Anybody, (who\ncan get a proposer and twenty second ers), can stand for President\nof Imperial College Union by putting their nomination on to the papers posted in the Union Lower Lounge from 19th February, (papers\nstay up for two weeks). You don't have to be what is generally rer\nfer red to as a \"Union hack\" in order to stand for ICU President,\nor indeed, to succeed.\nI myself had only ever once been on Union Council and then only\nin the often considered lowly position of Department Representative.\nNor do you necessarily have to be the person seen at the most social events during the year. I had only ever been to one ball before\ngetting elected, and am only now beginning to understand the whole\nsocial scene.\nSo what qualities do you need? If you want to get elected the\nmost important thing is to have some policies and to have some de termination. If you want to succeed and remain sane when you're\nelected to the job you mostly need a very thick skin.\nThe job is basically knowing everything that's going on in the\nUnion and trying to make sure that all policies of the Union are transmitted to the right body and that appropriate action is taken upon\nthem. Issues you might need to le am something about would of\ncourse include tuition fees, overseas students problems, refectories,\ngrants policy, accommodation, but of course you need to know generally how the structure of the Union works and how also the College structure works and how the two relate to each other. Above\nall, I suppose, you need to be flexible. The first job that ever hit\nme, for instance, was the problem of the Yacht Club, (something that\nbefore now I have always too depressed about to mention). Knowing\nnothing whatsoever about yachts (even pre vio sul y getting confused\nbetween dinghies and yachts), it had something of a novelty value.\nThe problem was that our Yacht Club was in possession of a yacht\nbought with some faults in the way that the engine had been fitted.\nWe were also unsure as to whether there might be other problems\nwith the yacht, and so right at the beginning of my year of office we\ndecided to have a survey of the yacht. Then came the problem of\ngetting the work done so that Yacht Club could start sailing. This\nmight seem easy enough but a whole number of problems came about\nsuch that in the end we were getting estimates of up to \u00a3800 for\nwhat should have been some minor work. This went on for seemingly\nmonths and thousands of meetings with different people about what\npossibly could be done with this yacht, but eventually the whole\nproblem was sorted out in December of last year when we got the\n'original sellers of the boat to agree to do the remedial repairs to the\nyacht.\nAiiuiner problem that just hit me out of the blue was right at the\nstart of this session when I discovered that there were a number of\npeople with a problem over grants (which I keep plugging in my ar-tic les). They were refused a grant because it was claimed they were\nnot \"ordinarily resident\" as described in the grant regulations. A happy ending of that problem has not as yet been achieved. After\nhours of letter writing to MP's and talking to the students about the\nproblem and talking to college authorities about their problems, we\nhave had a small success in that I am now told that College may be\nprepared to waive fees in certain instances for these students.\nAs well as needing to be able to react to new circumstances and\ntrying to work out what you can possibly do about them, you also\nneed as President to be able to initiate ideas and push people along\nwith ideas that they might have thought of but may be about to forget\nabout. An example is Welfare Day, when they needed a bit of extra\nencouragement to make sure that the date was even fixed although\nthe idea definitely came from Welfare Committee.\nAs well as thinking and pushing you have to go along and attend\nas many Union Committees as you possible can do in order to remain\nin touch with the Union. You are also on the College committees\nthat are seen as of vital importance to the Union, eg. Refectory,\nResidence committees.\nWell that's about it really. It's not exactly a fun job but it is qu ite absorbing. Anybody who wants to find out anymore about the job,\ndrop in and see me anytime.\nRefectory Boycott\nAs I hope you all know by now, the Refectory Boycott is next\nThursday, February 8th, and is of Southside Refectory only. There\n| is an article elsewhere in FELIX explaining the need for the Refectory Boycott so I won't say any more except to say \"Please do take\npart, and please also help by picketing if you've got any time at\nall,\" Mary A tt en borough\nICU President\n\n"

However, at that meeting it was noticeable that the atmosphere was\nmore relaxed due to the absence\nof some of our male friends who\ntend to dominate discussion.( I know I do too, but at least I'm aware of it!) The male stereotype\nis toward dominance, being in control (of oneself and of others) and\ntowards 'getting on' in a career.\nThe female stereotype is toward\ncaring for others (necessary in the\nrole of wife and mother), sub miss Jive ness and that the chief def in iI tion of success is through sexual\nattractiveness. (A 'career woman'\nis always rather pitied in her in ability to succeed as a woman\nthrough marriage.) Women therefore tend towards self approbation and a lack of aggression. It\nis difficult for women to overcome\nthis and enter into discussion( basically they tend to be shyer),\nwhereas a man may also be shy\nbut feels more of a need to overcome it in order to 'prove himself.\nNot only may it be difficult for\na man to understand such aspects\nof a woman's character but also he cannot appreciate the effect\nof continual reminders to women\nof the role they are supposed to\nplay. If Mr. Lu cock walks through\nthe streets at night he does not\nexpect to be harangued by people\nwho feel that the only reason he\ncan be there is due to his sexual\navailability, nor if he goes into a bar night can he expect references\nto him as merely a body to be\nleered or jeered at (as happens to\nwomen either as a sex, e.g.\" she stood on a bridge at midnight\",\nor as individuals, e.g. as in the\nlatest rather pleasant version of\n'Allouetta'). Some women do not\nobject to the fact that their role\nis seen as to be a sex object\n(though some like Anne Onimus\nof last week's issue feel that they\nshould be treated with a little mere\n'respect') but for women who are\ntrying to establish their right to\nbe an individual and not just an\nobject such events are both a denial of one's right to do so\nbut also an attack on women as\na sex.\nMale only events are very often\nsexist as they are aimed at re-emphasising a man's sex role\n(having a bit of fun with the lads)\nA women only meeting is merely\ntrying to give back some confidence to women and allow them to\ndiscuss freely in order to overcome the repressive pressures\nplaced by society which at present is largely in male control.\nIf Mr. Lu cock really does so\nwell understand female repression then he should also understand our need to get together\nin order to overcome our repress-ion. This does not mean that we\ndo not appreciate those male\nfriends prepared to help attack\nsexism and to most of our meetings we have welcomed their\nattendance.\nYours in sisterhood, '\nMary Attenborough\n\n"

Last Sun \u2022\nday, the Idols began as though they want ec1 to play to an empty room. The pub was fu.l at about 9, of people expecting to see Warren Harry.However it transpired that one of\nthe band had been unable to travel back from\nAustria for the gig, so The Idols had to take\nover, explaining the free entry. On hearing\nthis, a few left; on hearing the band's first\ncouple of numbers, even more left. To put\nit bluntly, they were disastrous.\n1 was just about to join those leaving,\nhaving just finished a pint, when the music\ndramatically improved. A fast version of\n\" That' s Alright Mama\" with a much tighter\nsound, was backed by an effective bass\nline and solid drumming.Having kept a few\nin the hall, mostly sheltering from the rain\nor getting pissed, The Idols produced their\nbest numbers (in my oh-so-humble opinion).\nA heavy metal reggae song \" King of the Dub*\ngot a few dancing at the front, then \" Spies in the Sky\" and \" Radar'' produced good\nkeyboard work, reminding me initially of Isotope and then of XTC' s crisp, economic\nstyle. The last few numbers of the set were\ntight, interesting but unmemorable ranging\nfrom punk to heavy metal. The only things\nworth noting were that the bar ran out of\ndraught beer, and some 21st birthday celebrations which turned into an entertaining\nfaked wrestling match.\nIf The Idols play near you, it's worth the\ntrouble to see them (besides it's a good ex cuse to go to a pub): - but they're still no where near as good as Warren Harry.\nA dedicated Warren Harry fan (if you hadn't, guessed).\nFILMS\nThe First Great Train Robbery (AA\nMichael Crichton)\nSean Connery, Donald Sutherland and Lesley Anne-Down conspire to divert a gold\nshipment their way in this lavish costume\ndrama set in 19th century London. As al ways Connery plays that suave (my God I wish I was him) character who is suited\nboth to the moments of suspense and the\nfrequent humour. The plot is typical and\ndrags in places, but the film is outstanding\ndue to the fine performances of its stars.\nNote; Ronald Biggs does not appear, although I'm sure he'll make money out of it\nsomehow.\nA Wedding ( A A. Robert Attman)\nDino and Muffin get married and return to\ntheir families' home for a lavish and well\nprepared reception. This mixture of families\nin conflict and wedding officials (notably\nsome hilarious security guards) is then exploited to produce a stylish, well acted com-ed y. Mia Farrow excels as the mentally\nretarded sister of the bride. Exactly who\nwas related to who and how I couldn't work\nout, but the film was so funny that it didn't matter. This is well worth a visit to the\ncinema.\nJaws 2 (A Zanuck, Brown)\nFollow ups are usually Foul ups and\nthis is so typical. If you've seen the original then the novelty is over and you will\nnot want to see a bunch of screaming teenagers be irv g eaten by a large great white once\nmore. The cast lacks any outstanding actors\nand the only real star is the excellent mechanical shark. I didn't like it but perhaps you\nwill. Don't say you weren't warned.\nCapricorn One (A, Peter Hyams)\nA highly original and moderately exciting\nadventure story, but not \" The greatest ad venture-on earth\" as billed. Astronauts who\nthink they are going to Mars are taken from\nthe capsule to a deserted military base corre\nTV studio. Here they stage a Fake landing\nbut soon things go wrong and they escape\ninto the desert. The following chase is the\nstrongest part of the film and brings it above\nthe norm. Although the dialogue leaves a lot\nto be desired and the story becomes thin in\nplaces, I would still recommend this as a very worthwhile night out.\nMark Smith\nMary O 'Malley's \"Once a Catholic\" Wynd\n-ham's Theatre, Charing Cross Road, WC2.\nWhen asked to review this play, I must admit that I didn't really know what to expect.\nThe title implies farce, and as a rule, I find\nlittle amusement in it. The play seeks to\nconduct a comic investigation into the dogmas of Irish Catholicism, and that in itself\nserves to give good indication of the style\nof humour adopted in the portrayal of the\nsubject. It is set in Harlesden in the late\nfifties, the principle conflicting powers\nbeing portrayed by the nuns running a convent school and the new (?) forming permissiveness of the fifties, personified by a\" ted\" Character by the name of Derek. In\nthe midst of the conflict are the schoolgirls\nin attendance at the convent, who (being at\n' O' level age) are seen as e qui voc at or s. As regards the performance of the play,\nthe main weaknesses were of a technical\nnature. The sets were unimaginative, and\nthe lighting was poor. If one ignores that,\nhowever, and turns one's attention to the\nstandard of acting, there was an exceptional\nstandard.\nJames (Z \u2014cars) Ellis' portrayal of the\nGuinness consuming, Irish Catholic priest\nwas convincing and numerous, and Angela\nVale's performance as the straight laced\nMother Peter succeeded in extracting more\nfrom the written part than one would have\nthought possible. The girls were superbly\nplayed, so well, in fact, that I was completely fooled until I saw the close-ups\noutside on the way out. Allan Corduner, play\n-ing the part of the immoral school boy, how-ever, was, in spite of being amusing, a poor\nchoice for the part. His acting was not so\nmuch at variance as his age, to the extent\nthat until I noticed the school blazer, I thought he was Mary Ballagher's father,\ninstead of her boyfriend.\nThere is no doubt in my mind that a catholic would find this play far more amusing\nthan I did. Much of the humour is based on\nreligion, and the intricacies of Catholicism.\nRegrettably, the rest of the humour was of\na somewhat baser nature. This of course\ntends to get more laughs, but in this case\nthe lag ghs were dearly purchased by stooping low into the oblivious depths of crudity.\nIt was mainly this which left me feeling that\na great deal of superb theatrical talent was\nbeing prostituted in a poor play, but I'm not\na Catholic!

However, early\narrival meant only having to wait in the cold and did not herald\nsuccess in the bowling.\nFive London University teams entered including three from IC and\nit seemed reasonable to expect some success. Halfway through Lon don 2 team were close to the lead, Danny Lau rolling a545 series,\nincluding a202 game, well supported by 504 from Edmond Ng of\nQE C. The bowling from the rest of the London teams was inconsistent and, on the whole, disappointing due to a mixture of unfamiliarity with the lanes at the Airport and bad bowling.\nThe second half continued in a similar fashion for London . Only Roland Hsie of UC and Fred Rad found any consistency, although\nneither could repeat their first series hi-games of 199 and 196 res-,\npec t iv ely.

The dense, snow-laden\nforest near Wendover was not to\nmost people's liking and several\nof IC's more illustrious runners\ndid not show the form that they\nhad been showing lately. The\nbest IC performance came from\nAndy Quickfall who finished third\non the B course, and claims to\nhave thoroughly enjoyed himself\nin the process, which left the\ntest of the club wondering what\nhe had been doing out in the\ndepths of darkest, snowy, Oxfordshire.\nCROSS\nCOUNTRY\nLast Saturday the Cross co un try club travelled up to the snowy\nwastes of Hampstead Ifeath for the\nannual UC5 race. A race to which\nmost of the southern Universities and colleges ate invited. Yet\nagain, Steve Kirk was the first\nI.C. runner to finish in 18th position (you're getting boring Steve)\nRich Green had a pleasing run to\nfinish in 30th, whilst Ian Morton,\na remnant from the D&D, eventually found his co-ordination half t fay around the course and bombed through the field to finish34 th.

The\nother I.C. runners were Gary Long\n- iur si(75), Rich Harrington (79),\nTim f fay waf d(121), and Francis Smith (126).\nThe IC team finished an ex-cell ent4 th, just missing out on\nthe.medals, but this was mainly\ndue to John Leonard of Golds mi ths who offered to run for us, and\nfinished an excellent 12th. This weekend London University are sending two teams up to\nStirling for the British Universi ties Championships. Not surprising\n4y Steve Kirk has been selected\nfor the 1st team, whilst the 2nd team is mainly the I.C.'A team\ncom p rising of Rich Green , Mick Kelly; Ian Morton, Bryan Acford,\nPaul Clarke, Dave Rosen and\nMaurice Wilson.

But Union Officer Sheyne\nLucock criticised its bias towards heterosexuality and several people said that the film's opening sequence tende'd to reinforce sex roles.\nAnother popular event was the\nhighly publicised condom blowing\ncompetition. Criticised by members of the Christian Union as\n\"a disgrace to the College\", it\nattracted eight teams of five pe o ple. The \" Bionic Blowers\", a team from Electrical Engineering\nand Mines, quickly emerged as\nthe winner and was awarded the\nprize of a bottle of whisky.

Is an affiliated society of the University of London Student Union.\nThis article is to tell you what it stands for and what it hopes to\nachieve.\nWe believe that society' s obligations towards its members should\nbegin when their lives begin, at conception. We believe that any\nattempt to establish some time after conception when society should\nsuddenly take up the responsibility for protecting life is both irrational and, in the long run, impossible. Irrational because there are\nno serious grounds for saying that life begins after conception, and\nimpossible because the problems which make the unborn unwanted\nare no less serious after birth and the arguments used to justify\nabortion must one day, in all conscience, be used to justify infanticide and compulsory euthanasia.\nWe believe that when pregnancies are unwanted our response\nshould be to remove the evils in society which make them unwanted,\nrather than to remove the unborn who are not responsible themselves\nfor anything that is evil. We intend to use all democratic means available to persuade society round to the6 e views. In particular we intend to campaign\nagainst the 1967 Abortion Act and the present Union policy of free\nabortion on demand. Our aim is to campaign for the provision of\npositive alternatives to abortion.\nThe Abortion Act specifies \" the risk of serious handicap at\nbirth\" as one of the circumstances in which abortion may be legal.\nRecently this clause has been more widely used with the gradual\ndevelopment of techniques for seeking out the blind or deaf or crippled before their birth in order that they may be killed. We propose that rather society change itself so that the handicapped are accepted as equal citizens with a contribution as val u able as anyone else' s, in some ways even more valuable. One particular part of society which needs changing in this way is the University of London. With all the sports, social and cultural fac ili ties offered to students here, how has it been that so-little is done\nto make the University truly accessible to handicapped students?\nWe intend to campaign that this should be amuch higher priority\nboth for University money and student's union activity.\nThe problems which face a single parent family are often used to\njustify abortion. We propose, rather, that abortion is one of the\nreasons why society so often evades its responsibilities to these\nfamilies, why, for example, the 40,000 students of London University have only a maximum of 143 nursery places available for the\nchildren they have or may want to have. The issues are inseparably\nlinked. Nurseries are expensive, abortions cheap, and a society\nwhich permits and encourages the destruction of its most awkward\nmembers before their birth will always have the perfect excuse for\ndisregarding them afterwards. P.A.T.A. has no such excuse. This is why we intend to take up and join in the campaigns for handicapped students and College Nurseries.\nP.A.T.A. has no party political or religious affiliations. Membership is open to all who would like to register their beliefs on this\nICCA G PG Tips\nWell It is Monday again (it is\nfor me) as I sit down at my type-writer, knowing that all you out\nthere are waiting impatiently for\nthis prosaic gem, and decide I 've\ngot better things to do then to\nkeep you amused during lectures,\nso hard luck.

    "content": "COUNCIL REPORT The Deputy President of Imperial College Union may become a sabbatical post next session (1978^9) despite the College's decision that no extra money will be available to the Union.\nA decision by IC Union Council on Monday to set up a fourth sabbatical post and find the means to pay for it from existing income\ncame after the Union Finance Committee had discussed several possible sources of finance.\nNo decision on how to raise the necessary money has been taken,\nbut four ideas are being investigated:\n- Income from room bookings\n- The setting up of a local discount scheme\n- Bookshop income.\n- Giving all sabbatical officers only three free terms in hall they\nwould have to pay for the fourth.\nThe existing sabbatical union posts are President, Honorary Secretary and FELIX Editor. The sabbatical Deputy President will take\non the work of the Honorary Junior Treasurer in addition to his\nexisting tasks. Departmental Representatives\nCouncil agreed a job de scrip tion for Departmental Representatives, drawn up by the Academic Affairs Committee. A Departmental Representative exists to represent the views of the student\nmembers of the department, ac cording to the job description, wh -ich goes on to list eleven ara as of concern to the Dep. Rep. involving his job within his department and his role in Imperial College Union and the Constituent\nmeeting of 15 per cent of the Un ion membership in a department\nshould be empowered to dismiss their Representative by a simple\nmajority vote. No dismissal procedure exists at present.\nFreshers' Reception\nThe nature of the fresher s' reception at the beginning of the\nautumn term was the subject of a motion to Council proposed by\nAcademic Affairs Officer Roger\nStotesbury. He was concerned that\nthe interruptions to speeches at\nthe reception and the \"excessive\nCollege Unions. An IC Union General Meeting is ly silly behaviour\" was harmful\nto be asked to approve a bye-law to the reputation of ICU and s ug change laying down the procedure geste d that interruptions to spee\nby which a Dep. Rep. may be disc he s should not be permitted,\nmissed. It is suggested that a Council disagreed with Roger\nStotesbury's firm line but passed\nan amended motion which said t hat \"the introduction of fresher s to IC Union should be as informal as possible,\" Many Council members felt, however, that the\ninformality should remain within\nreasonable limits and it was agreed that only Council members\nand mascot bearers should sit\non the platform at the reception.\nPots\nSeveral proposals from IC publications, clubs and societies and\nthe Union Welfare Officer for pots\nin the Union Bar led to Council deciding that the whole question\nof pots be discussed fully at the\nnext Council meeting. A problem\nhas arisen because there is a shortage of space behind the bar\nand Union Secretary Mike Elk in is to investigate the matter.\nCouncil agreed that the accusations about Deputy President\nMalcolm Brain made in FORWARD, the IC Liberal Club Newsletter,\nwere objectionable. FORWARD had claimed that Malcolm Brain had caused noise in the Bert Quad\nin the early hours of the morning\nand was \"one of the biggest p** artists at IC\" .\nA suggestion that Council shou\n\u2022Id resume an earlier practice of\nholding one meeting per session in Silwood was agreed in principle\nsubject to ratification. The date\nput forward for this trip was 14th May.\nNEWS IN BRIEF AROUND COLLEGE\ncon td. from front page\nMr. Dilipkumar, who is coloured,\ntol da FELT X reporter that he had\napplied for the job in order to\ntest whether the company lived\nup to its claim that it endeavours\n\"to fulfil the aspirations of each\nracial group\".\nHowever, because the company\nwas aware of the letter and, ac cording to Mr. Dilipkumar, had\nbeen told by Dr. Harris at the ou^ set that his job application was\nnot genuine, Mr. Dilipkumar was\nnot given a proper interview, he\ntold FELIX. Instead the interviewer attacked him over the con tents of the letter saying that the\nclaims made were untrue and that\nthe company would be recruiting\ncoloured people from Britain as\nwell as whites.\nAs a result Union President\nMary Attenbotrmgh decided to\nsend a letter of complaint to Dr. Harris objecting to .the treatment\nof Mr. Dilipkumar and the sending\nof a copy of the Union's letter\nto Roberts Construction.\nFollowing Roberts' visit a meeting of the College Careers Advisory Committee on Wednesday decided that the Careers Advisory Service would not in future cooperate with the Union in sending\ninterviewees a statement of the\nUnion's views on any company.\nThe implementation of Union\npolicy on recruitment for jobs in\nSouth Africa is likely to be discussed by the Union Academic\nAffairs Committee on February\n12th. Help for Iranian Students\nIranian students, who may be\nsuffering financial hardship due\ntor the current situation in Iran,\nhave been told that they can cl aim emergency payments for six weeks from local social security\noffices.\nStudents should go to the office of the Department of Health\nand Social Security nearest to\nwhere they are living. Local offices are listed in the telephone directory.\nThe Kensington and Chelsea offices, referred to in Mary Attenborough's letter to Iranian students last week, should only be\ncontacted by students living in\nthose areas. These are postal\nareas W6, W8 and W14 for Kensington and SW5, SW6, SW7 and\nSW10 for Chelsea. Tuition Fees\nIncreases in tuition fees of\nabout fO per cent are expected\nto be announced shortly. A joint\nmeeting of the External Affairs\nand Overseas Students Committees decided to campaign for Imp e rial College not to implement\nany fee increases and to charge\noverseas students at the home\nrate .\nPresent fee levels are \u00a3545\nfor home undergraduates and \u00a3705\nfor overseas undergraduates. The\npostgraduate fees are \u00a3805 and\n\u00a3925 respectively.\nThe External Affairs Officer\nhas estimated that it would cost\nthe College \u00a3432,173 to accept\nthe Union demand in full.\nThe Postgraduate Group Committee also agreed to support the\ncampaign.\nMountaineering Club Plague\nThe Union is to pay for a new\nplaque to replace the one removed\nfrom the wall outside the Union\nDining Hall. The plaque commemorates IC\nstudents who died in a mountaineering expedition in 1961.\nDepartmental Representative\nNo candidate has been nom in at\" ed for the post of Mineral Resources Engineering Departmental Representative. The position is va cant following the resignation of\nGary Warren. Papers will remain\nup until someone comes forward.\nLiberal Club\nIC Union Executive has stated\nthat the comments made by Liberal Club about the College media by no means reflect the views\nof the Union Executive. The Executive has called upon\nthe Liberal Club to apologise for\ntheir actions and expressed a hope\nthat \" no club will act in a similar\nirresponsible manner in the future\". The comments were made in an\narticle in the club's newsletter\nFORWARD! dubbed \" Sideways\" by the Executive, and caused a stir among members of STOIC and\nIC RADIO. Accidents\nBernard Smith, a student representative on four College safety\nCommittees is urging all students\nto report any accidents occurring\nin College.\nThe Technical and Advisory\nSafety Committee investigate\naccidents for the purpose of decreasing the College accident\nrate. It is therefore beneficial to\nall students that the c irc um stan ces of accidents should be known.\nGuilds UG MAt the last Guilds Union Meeting, held on Thursday 25 January,\nBob Hart began to speak on a motion discussing the recruitment of\ngraduates for South Africa by companies at IC. The Chairman ruled\nit out of order in view of the doubt expressed by a large number\nof Union members that perhaps\nGuilds should not be debating\nsuch a subject.\nIt was added that the feeling\nof most of the Guilds Exec was\nthat if any motion involves Guilds\nUnion Members, it should be d is cussed at a C&G Union meeting,\nhowever, a decision must be taken\nbefore a debate may begin.\nKeith Rogers was voted Guilds Publicity officer. His posters\nhave been praised by many stud-ents, including his rival in the\nelection.\nGuilds revealed a new initiation routine which involved Tomato Ketchup. Both Keith and Mark\nCorrigan had to guess who owned\nvarious pairs of knees, while blindfolded. If they guessed incorrectly they were liberally daubed\nwith Ketchup.\nFalmouth Theft\nLast Saturday, while watching\nthe 'Two Ronnie s', in Falmouth'sTV lounge, a resident heard what\nhe believed to be two gunshots.\nHe rushed out into the gallery\nand found that the Pool table had\nbeen rifled. Not only had \u00a360 in\nlOp pieces been stolen but also\nmost of the table mechanism and\nseveral balls. The main part of the ball distribution equipment was mysteriously found and returned. Play soon restarted although residents\nare still searching for the black\nball. "

    "content": "Page 8\nThe British Army & Ireland\n\u2014Join the Army; travel to exotic distant lands; meet exciting, unusual people and kill them.\nThe professional British Army of today can be traced back to the\n17th century during the period of the \" Glorious Revolution\". The\nreasons for the raising and up-keep of this'first regular force were\nthe suppression of the Irish people and the defence of the Protestant religion. After the pacification of Ireland, the last dissenters,\nthe Scottish Clans, were first defeated and then decimated by a period of bloody repression. Next came the time of unlimited colonial conquest, extending the boundaries of the Empire and leaving\nthe British Army par-excel lance a counter-insurgency force.\nEngland first invaded Ireland in 1169 and in 1171 King Henry n himself visited the country to try and assert feudal ties. The practical difficulties of medieval communications across a large expanse\nof sea made the Crown's task of supervision difficult but in 1541\nHenry\\v ni went to Dublin and proclaimed himself \" King of this\nland of Ireland as united, annexed and knit forever to the Imperial\ncrown of the Realm of England\". The policy of \" plantation\" was\nfoi u mula ted to stamp out the characteristics of the native Irish. Lands were confiscated and planted with settlers from England and\nScotland. When resistance was encountered the TUDORS dealt\nwith it with a ferocity which, in the words of the great historian\nLec ky\" has seldom been exceeded in the pages of history\". The\nmost successful of all\" plantations\" was completed in the reign of\nJames I principally in the six of the nine counties of Ulster (1609).\nSince the Reformation in England had made no impression on Catho li c Ireland, the Protestant plantation established a cleavage be tween the two sections of the Irish population and so now religion\ndetermined political thinking and set a pattern for the social and\npolitical development of Ireland right up to the present day. Hence\nthe so called\" Religious Divide\". In 1641 the Puritan Parliament of England decreed the absolute\nsuppression of the Catholic religion in Ireland and in this year a great rebellion broke out. The effect of the rebellion's final suppression by the Parliamentary forces under Cromwell in 1652 was\ndevastating ty clear. The terrible suffering which Cromwell inflicted\nin the name of God on all Catholic rebels in Ireland forged for them\nsomething like a single identity and strengthened still further the\ncleavage between them and the other (planted Protestant) part of\nIreland's population. During this war one third of the Catholic-Irish\n(over 600,000) died and 100,000 were sold as slaves to the West\nIndies and other colonies. The end result was that more than % of\nthe cult iv able land was to be found in the hands of a small minority\nof Protestants (descended from the English and Scottish plantation^\nAs a direct result of the potato famine (1845) the population of\nIreland decreased by one half in twenty years with VA million dead,\nyet from every part in Ireland cargoes of oats, barley, bacon, eggs,\nbutter and other foodstuffs continued to sail for England. As agitation for independence continued through armed struggle there was an\nimmediate outcry from the Protestant industrial North -East, who\ninitiated a series of pogroms against the Catholic workers.\nIn the General Election of 1918 it was obvious that the Majority\nof Irish people sought freedom and the British government, having\nsuccessfully used \" divide and rule\" for eight hundred years and,\nseeing that they would be unable to defeat the Irish forces, partitioned Ireland leaving six of the counties of Ulster s as Northern\nIreland and still part of Britain. The material basis for this\nartificial formation of the North Ireland state let, against the wishes\nof the majority, was the increased pace of capitalist development in\nthe North East. The policy of divide and rule was carried on by succ es sive Unionist governments in Northern Ireland and hence the\nanomalous situation of Unionist dominated trade-unions as allies of\nme bourgeoisie. The fundamental class conflict is exacerbated by\nthe pri vele ged access of Protestant workers to scarce jobs and so\nalthough both sections of the working class are exploited, one is\nslightly better off than the others, and so the Protestant worker offers allegiance to right-wing bigot ted politicans of the same government in power for ova fifty years so that he may continue to have\nthis slightly better situation. For over half a century Britain gave\nblanket approval to blatant disc rima tory practices and repression of\nCatholic/nationalist workers and middle class so that the Unionist government would get the support it needed. ;\nFifteen thousand troops continue to hold this artificially formed\ncountry for Britain but in the media they are just \" keeping the peace\nbetween the squabbling Irish\". British justice under the 1973 Emer*.\ngen cy Provisions Act( E.P \u00abA \u00ab) works like this. An 18 years old boy\nis arrested by the police in Belfast. He is now held for 72 hours\nwithout being charged (section 88 of Part 2 of E.P.A.). He is forc i bly finger printed and photographed (section II of E.P.A \u00ab)\u00bb He is\ndenied access to a solicitor and his parents are not told he is there\n(under E.P.A*)? He is beaten up and forced to sign a confession\n(not legal under E.P.A.,; but it happens - Amnesty International). He\nis charged with membership of Fianna NaH 'eireann (illegal under\nE J'.A.in N. Ireland but not Britain). He spends the next 2 years on\nremand before coming to trial (known as internment by remand). The\ncourt has no jury (but an amendment to the E.P.A.). He is assumed\nguilty until proven innocent (section 9 of Part 1 of E.P.A.). The\nevidence is slim, but he was found to be in possession of a document of Fianna NaH'E ireann. That is enough to convict him\n(section 21 of Part3,\" possession by a person of a document shall be evidence of that person belonging to the organisation at the time\nwhen he had the document in his possession\". Journalists watch\nout!) He is sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\nThe British Army is the main instrument that has been used by\nsuccessive governments to deny the right of self determination to\nALL the Irish people. Its role in Ireland is as in Aden, Kenya etc. not peace-keeping but counter-insurgency.\nNot long ago we ruled the world\nWith cane and bowler hat\nNow all we've left is Ulster\nAnd we've trouble holding that.\nThe public school taught us to rule \u2014\nWe'll keep those natives down\nSo don 't call US tyrannical \u2014\nWe're loyal to the Crown.\nCHORUS\nUpper class pu kka class officers' mess\nWe've walked on the Irish\nSince Good Queen Bess,\nA kick in the knacker s will make 'em confess,\nUpper class, pu kka class, born to oppress....\nThey say Strasbourg may condemn US \u2014\nHow dare THEY interfere?\nYou take Sir Edward Compton's word \u2014\n// never happened here.\nIt's all right to kick an Irishman,\nWe say it without shame.\nIt's just part of our tradition \u2014\nPlay the Man, and Play the Game.\nDEBSOC\nMINI - DEBATE\nMOTION:\nThis house does not believe\nin proportional representation\nTIME:\n1.15 pm\nDATE:\nThurs 8th Feb\nPLACE:\nMech Eng 340\nCOMING SOON\n\" This house defends the right of every student to remain aloof\nfrom the activities of his student union.\"\" This house believes scientists and technologists should be\nable to communicate more effectively\".\" This house does not believe in equal opportunity\".\nIf you wish to participate in any of the above debates, contact\nM.
