    "content": "18 January 1998 Sport & Diversions 23\nCRICKET: England2 nd best again Following a series win against South Africa last summer, and the prospect of not having to faces pinking Shane Warne, England supporters were filled\nwith hope and expectation that England\nwould actually give Australia a run for\ntheir money for the first time in 10 years.\nThe build up to the first test was not\nideal, with several players showing a lack\nof form in the warm-up matches and a worrying back problem for former captain Mike Atherton. The first test was played in Brisbane at the end of Novemeber, and the early going looked to be fairly even, with Australia reaching1064. But a number of missed chances followed which allowed Steve Waugh and Ian Healey (perennial thorns in England's side) to put on187 runs for the6 th wicket, and some extra runs from the tail\ntook the total to 485. Predictably England\ncould not manage to match this score,\nbut looked like the might get pretty close\nat 360-6 until the tail collapsed to 375 all\nout. A rapid-fire century from dashing opener Michael Slater set up a large target for England, who predictably wilted\nto the leg spin of Stuart McGill, and were saved defeat by a freak thunderstorm. Definitely a morale if not actual victory for\nHat-trick Victims: Ian Healy, Stuart McGill and Colin Miller fall to successive deliveries from Darren Gough, who became the first English bowler for 100 years to\ntake an Ashes hat trick against Australia\nAustralia. On to Perth, and a much faster\nwicket saw21 year old Earl's Court native\nAlex Tudor make his test match debut.\nUnfortunately the England batting (miss-ing best batsman Graham Thorpe, returned home with a serious back pro b lem) was woeful, making only 112 &\n191. Australia romped to a7 wicket victory inside 3 days, and the s cries was looking decidedly out of England's reach.\nThe only positive to come out of the\nmatch was the performance of Tudor,\nlooking decidedly relaxed and hostile,\nwhich made the decision to leave him out for the next test in Adelaide questionable to say the least. This was the\nground England won their only test\nmatch of the last tour, but it was not to\nbe this time. A big hundred from Justin\nLanger and a complete lack of application by Lngland's tail in c it her innings led\nto a205 run loss. England were down and looked on course for a40 defeat in\nthe five match s cries, so cue the usual\nresponse of the England cricket team in\nthese circumstances win a match. Decent batting from skipper Alec Stewart, relieved of the wicket-keeping duties,\ngave England a decent score. Darren\nGough then bowled some of the most\nhostile fast bowling I have seen by an\nEnglish bowler, and Australia's batting\nwas finally blown away for once, giving\nEngland a12 run victory, after the hosts\nwere seemingly cruising to the win. I his\nset up the possibility of England squaring\nthe series in Sydney. Although the\npitched turned square and Warne returned to play alongside the impressive\nMcGill, England did not play badly, but a poor decision by the IV replay umpire\ngiving Slater in when he was clearly out\neventually cost England the match.\nSo although Iam pleased my prediction\nfrom November(31 to Australia) came out right, it is disappointing to only see\nEngland playing well when they have\nalready conceded the series. On the\nbright sides England surely .start as one of the favourites for this summer's cricket\nWorld Cup, with conditions giving the\nhost side a distinct advantage.\nBound Editions\nThe following people ordered 1997-8 Bound Editions and have not yet collected them.

After playing a series of short tutorials which\nintroduce most of the basic moves\n(your bread and butter extortion\nrackets, and rather nasty Gang ster based mayhem), its time to\nget on with the job of controlling\nt's an offer I can't refuse, they first told the town proper.\n}\n\u2022 Buy to* $rm\ni/~\\ \u00bb r Henry's Dressmaking Habit was well known\nme last summer and they were right.\nThe people behind Gangsters rounded up several not that busy journalists, took them to Green ham Common the site of the abandoned US airbase, and let us go mad with automatic paint guns, grenades and smoke bombs. Oh and while we were there they let us play\nwith the game. First impressions were that the game was going to be another\nbig Eidos game. It looked pretty enough to play with and appeared to have the depth of gameplay that enables a game to be tasking without forcing a two week manual reading session. Winter drew on and finally the game was rounded off,\nthe same journalists received review As in the real world the idea is not\nto dirty your own hands but to force others to dirty theirs. This you do by organising your men into teams with weapons,\nvehicles and sufficient manpower. These\nteams are then given their orders for\nthe week with obvious risks for as sass i nations, bombings and setting fire to\nthe businesses who fail to buy into the\n'insurance market'? The 'valuable mutual\nbenefit market' to give it its full name. There is obviously less risk but also less\nprofit to be made by owning a few clean\nshops, but they can be used to mix good and bad money and provide a local safe\nhouse for the little dears who work for\nyou. The least risk of course goes with\nordering your team to pop down the\nshop to buy a copy of the local paper -well okI made the last task up but with\nother gangs coveting your little area and willing to put more lead into your diet,\nsomeone must pop down to the shops for the milk and coffee.\nAfter the orders stage it is time to hit\nthe streets and watch all your best laid\nplans suffer from those little irritants\nknown as the general public, the police\nand other gangsters. Luckily there are still\na few tricks up your sleeve, and while\nyour thugs are pretty brainless they can\ndeviate from the plans with a simple few clicks of the mouse. The action scenes\nare also the place to be to sec your little\nempire move onwards and upwards, very rewarding in a nasty pain\ninflicting way.\nAlthough there has not been a huge improvement in the graphics or the sound since the summer both are about average in a game like this. The town can be viewed either in simple top down plan\nmode which is easier to plan\nwith, or in a3D mode which is\nused for the action sequences. The victims, sorry citizens, of New Temperance can be heard and seen to interact with your employ-ees. The town does feel a little like a1930's City. The game actually feels good to play - despite the burning, blowing up\nand shooting that goes on, and the only\nsmall gripe tte is that it perhaps takes too long to get a proper empire flowing and so for some takes a little too long to get\ngoing. For those who love management games it is one to sit on the shelf and play into the long hours. For those with\nonly arcade games and fast flowing graphics on their minds it's not going to\nturn your head in the same way that\nC&C and Red Alert could. It's good, Lat\nTony, but not quite good enough to talk\nits way out of the concrete overcoat.\nGary S. Bloke behaving badly\nideas from Eidos - Apart from Lara IV what's in store !\nwar zone2100 Damn those satellite weapon platforms.\nWhen they're not being used to shoot at\nMulder and Scully by\nrogue Al's they go all\nwrong and trigger a global\nnuclear arme ged don. It's just not fair.\nThus the scene is se\nfor War zone2100. As one of the remaining million\npeople left on the s mo king ruins you have the task of rebuilding\nNorth America and to get some of those\nlost technologies working again (though\nif you ask me leaving it\nas a smoking ruin and moving to Europe might\nbe a more sound idea).\nIf you think this sounds rather Mad Max esque, you would not be too far from being wrong. Against you are various\nbands of scavengers along with the occasional remnant of civil iz arion. Yep you could well be thinking Mad Max. Despite having a story sounding like Mad Max it does appear to be half\ndecent (at this stage of development anyway). Placed very near the Battlez one2000 ideal of realtime playing combined with base strategy and defence it\ncould challenge Tiberian Sun, whenever that decides to poke its head above the\nground and parade itself for our delights.\nLet's hope the large number of options\ndoesn't make the game impossible to\nunderstand and play properly.\nNot the New Year News\nPentium III - Intel goes for speed\nIn a very low key way Intel Corp released details of the next generation of processors. Chosing the highly original name Pentium III, Intel intend to start shipping450 and 500 MHz versions immediately. Along with the raw clock speed increase, they\nhave also included some extra hardware to help speedup video, audio and sp ee ch\nrecognition tasks.\nIntel also intend to move to a new processing facility which should allow the speed to increase to600 MHz and above. Intel will also release a mobile version of the chip (in the new600 MHz flavour) for laptops but not until the second half of this year. Just in time for the Millenium bug if they're lucky.\nFree Lunch pays dough\nFreeserve (the Free internet service provider paid for by Dixons - your friendly, neigh-b our hood electrical retailer) has managed to entice over 900,000 people to use Internet Explorer 4 and sign their pledge to their internet connection. Officially the fastest\ngrowing ISP in the UK (900 000 customers in 5 months kicks AOL' s UK branch into\nthe dirt.)\nMark Danby, general manager of Freeserve said: \"It shows we have developed the right formula for our customers and that you don't have to pay for a first class\ninternet service.\" The big catch is that for those less technically adept users there is\nno free advice and help line.

    "content": "18 ^Jfc^* Film 18 January 1999\nReviews\nPsycho * *\nStarring : Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche, Julianne Moore, Viggo Mortensen, William H Macy\nDirector: Gus Van Sant\nPsycho 1999 vs Psycho 1960. Same shower. Same knife. New blood.\nT here's something very strange\nabout Gus Van Sant's remake of Psycho. It's not the fact that it's very, very, very similar to Hitchcock's original - I was expecting that when I walked into the cinema. The problem is\nthat, despite the fact that it's almost the same film, it's far, far worse. And I don't know why. It's not the cast - admittedly, Anne Heche( Six Days Seven Nights, Volcano)\nis hardly in the same league as middle-class fantasy girl Janet Leigh, but it's certainly not a bad rendition of Marion Crane. Moreover, whilst Vince Vaughn( Swingers, The Lost World) is the antithesis of Anthony Perkins in the crucial Norman Bates role, he comes away from the\nmovie with credit in tact thanks to a nice\nline in disconcerting laughter and nervous twitching.\nIt's definitely not the direction - Van Sant goes to great pains to re-create 9 9 %\nof the original (only adding in a couple of additional details which help to explain\nVaughn' s complex mentality). Every\nscene, every camera angle and every\nedit is the same even the opening titles\nare copied from Hitchcock. Besides, with\nthe likes of My Own Private Idaho, Drugstore Cowboy and last year's brilliant\nGood Will Hunting on his CV, Van Sant is\namongst Hollywood' s foremost dire c tors.\nAbove all, it certainly isn't the plot,\nwhich is 1 0 0 % the same as it was in\n1960. Heche steals $400 000 from her\nboss, flees town, hiding out in the lonely\nBates motel, run by Vaughn and his mysterious mother. The classic shower scene\nensues and her sister ( Moore) and boyfriend (Mortensen) set off on her trail, call in a Private Lye (the ever-reliable\nMacy) and try to find out what links her\ndisappearance and the motel.\nPerhaps it's simply the passage of time. The elements that produced a classic in the sixties simply don't stand up to\nnineties moviemaking. This Psycho is\n(dare I say it) boring. It treads water for\nan hour, only hot ting up when Moore finally enters the Bates' gothic home to\ndiscover the truth. That's not to say that\nthe original I's y cho isn't still a great\nmovie, it's just that any piece of art has\nto be judged at least in part - by the standards of the day. For example, if the forthcoming Star Wars Episode One\nretains exactly the same look and effects\nas A New Hope did in 1977, it won't deserve the same recognition because it\nwon't have the same ground-breaking\noriginality. Similarly, this doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with remaking old movies see Scarface, The Magnificent Seven, High Society, and the upcoming You've Got Mail for prime examples of good remakes - it simply\nmeans that there's no point in remaking\nsomething if you don't add something new. Van Sant has claimed that all he wanted to do was raise the profile of the\noriginal, and to those of you who haven't seen it, I suggest you take his advice -and rent the video D Dave\nThe Opposite of Sex * *\nStarring : Christina Ricci, Martin Donovan, Lisa Kudrow, Ivan Sergei\nDirector: Don Roos\nH ave you ever missed a fort-night's episodes of your favourite soap opera and completely lost track of what's going on? Whatever the reason for the lapse in\nyour devotion, there's usually someone on hand to bring you up to date with a swift summary of the recent developments in an oddly eventful Square,\nClose or Street in the land of TV. The opening5 minutes of Ihe Opposite of\nSex ate liable to remind you of such a briefing - though with a now obligatory\npost-modern slant it's the film's central\ncharacter, 16 year Dee dee played by\nThe Adams Family's Christina Ricci\n(more recently star of indie-hits The Ice\nStorm and The Last of the High Kings)whose voice-over provides the explanation of her own troubled circumstances.\nRicci's unenthusiastic mourning at\nher step-father's funeral suggests that\nshe's not so upset to see the back of him,\nbut bereavement has driven her mother to unbearably neurotic depths. Desperate to escape her Louisiana home, Ricci\nheads for Indiana and her long lost half-brother (Donovan), though her reasons\nfor doing so probably extend beyond the hope of renewing acquaintances.\nThanks to the legacy of his gay lover,\nDonovan is a wealthy man, and his easy\nEighteen certificate here we come.\ngoing nature provides a standing invitation for Ricci's precocious mercenary wiles. Donovan' s friend (and his dead lover's sister - keep up) Kudrow is convinced that Ricci is no good, and sure\nenough, she sets about the rather\nunlikely seduction of his new nice but\ndim boyfriend, Ivan Sergei. Very soon the resulting love triangle is further complicated by announcements of pre g nancy, charges of sexual harassment,\nand other storylines culled from the scripts of third rate Dallas spin offs.\nThere are one or two funny lines,\nand Kudrow has her fair share as the repressed Lucia. However, she seems unable to abandon the trademark kookiness of her role as Pheobe from Friends,\nand comes across as half s catty, half\nuptight. Even though she shares screen\ntime evenly with her co-stars, it's Ricci\nwho dominates the film. Unfortunately,\nher non-politically correct knowing commentary fails to illicit the belly laughs it\naims for, and succeeds in lending the proceedings an irritatingly self-satisfied\ntone.\nWhen a soap like Channel 5's plainly\nridiculous Sunset Beach does a better job\nof s at i rising attitudes to sex in the90 s, a film like this seems pretty pointless.

    "content": "18 January 1999\nBLACK STAR LINER\nBengali Bantam Youth Experience!\nFEAR OF POP\nBLACK STAR LINER *\nSearching the wonderful expanse known as the worldwide web I was struggling to find a picture\nfor the above space which I obviously\nnever found and had to settle for the album cover instead. During my wandering through cyberspace I came across many Black Star Liners, but not\nthe band. Apparently it was the name of Marcus Garvey's dream of a pan-African shipping line. Perhaps not very\ninteresting, but is this how Black Star\nLiner the band ended naming them selves? Something for you to think\nabout don't spend too long on it, it\ncould be a health risk.\nAnyway, on to the album proper. As\nyou can easily s uss out from the album's title. Black Star Liner are one of the multitude of bands in the scene labelled by\nsome as \"The Asian Underground\". I'm not sure if this term is used by music\nindustry bod s to group together bands\nwith an Asian sound to their style or if it\nmeans that a member is a person of\nAsian origin?\nWell, BSf fit into both categories\nwith an array of sitars, tabla s and more conventional samplers providing a more\nWestern dance beat. BSL are not new to\nthe so called \"Asian Underground\" and have built up a devoted fan base. The\nuse of synth violins is abundant and very\neffective, although it can get a little\nrepetitive at times. The album's opener Slta D sets the mood, dark and oppressive but always provides you with a hint\nof lightness to relieve the claustrophobia.\nSuperfly and Blndl has leanings towards\nthe majority of Massive Attack's Karmacoma. What I would like to know is\nwhether BSL listeners actually know what\na bindi is?! Chilled out is blatantly the\napproach here, so if you like your sounds\nmellow give this a try. H Jason\nVolume 1\nNormally, spoken word' concept' albums invoke images of crusty Beat poets smoking Gauloises in dingy fulham cafes - the preserve of musical psu edo intellect u als like Neil Hamm on. So a spoken word album from the lead singer of\nchirp y, Prozac-fuelled Ben folds Live\nsounds about as likely as Marilyn Manson covering B 'witched.\nHowever, a spoken word album is\nprecisely what Mr Fold has produced and it is nowhere near as honey-fie d as\nyou might think. Lor starters, the back-ground music displays instrumentation\nfar more varied and interesting than the poppy but ultimately bland Ben folds\nfive's efforts.\nMr Fold takes us back to Starsky and Hutch with his ' waka waka' song Kops,\nand over to Japan for the most bizarre\nsong. In Love - William Shatner talks\nabout his love for a girl, his acting capabilities used to the fullest. It's almost as\nmoving as when he says 'Fire!' in a Star\nTrek film. Ben folds five eventually show their face in Avery M. Powers Memorial\nBcltaway. There's no keyboard but the barbershop quartet are certainly there.\nIt'sac liche to cite Beck, but the\nexperimentation and diversity of the music, which in truth dominates the spoken word aspects, are at Beck-like stan-dards. Should you buy it? I'm not sure.\nIt's hard to say whether I like this album because it's good or because it's not as\nbad as it could have been. Try before you buy, I think. CI\nOliver H singles\nLlama Farmers - Big Wheels\nCraving controversy by putting a photograph of an eight-year-old girl smoking on their record sleeve, Llama\nFarmers would do better to let their music take the front\nseat. A constant fight between R.L. M. style semi-acoustics and the powerful clatter of drums and guitars,\nBig Wheels is a more than satisfying song to take us into\nthe new year. It is well deserving of its more than generous airplay.\nEve6 - Leech\nJust as we can not have the hedonism of New Year's Lve without the annoyance of Angus Deayton on our\nTV screens, so we can not have a thriving British indie\nscene without the occasional disturbance of a band that\nuses volume as a substitute for talent. Eve6 are such a band.\nUmajets - When I Wake Up\nIn one respect, Umajets are a lot like the Lighthouse\nFamily in that they both seem to release a lot of singles\nthat sound the same. However, Umajets provide us not\nwith cheesy MOR pop-soul, but a relaxed concoction of Beatlesy melodies and West Coast harmonies. Not\nthat bad, actually.\nMonster Magnet - Powertrlp\nThe title track from both Kerrang's and Metal Hammer's album of the year, Powertrip is also featured in Kurt Russell's new film, Soldiers. So, we kind of expect it to be\nquite good. Actually it's pants, a hilarious combination of he aw metal and lets-do-the-hand-Jive.\nLoop Da Loop - Hazel\nThe remix master Loop Da Loop( a.k.a. Nick Dresti) provides us here with the first of his own material. Released\nnext month. Hazel is a comic mixture of the Freestylers'\nstyle and Big Beat's, erm, big beats. LdJ\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Grand Drive - Wrong Notes\nThis one's definitely a bit of a grower. The vocals arc\nalmost identical to those of the dread-locked lead\nsinger of the long absent, grunge y and at the same time\nmellow, Soul Asylum. The song uses a hammond and pleasant acoustic guitars that lean towards Spanish\nstrumming to create a dreamy number.3 Colours Red - Beautiful Day\nThis is a far cry from the punk y freshness of previous\nsingles like Nuclear Holiday. Instead 3 Colours Red\nhave chosen a melancholic an the mic string laden ditty\nto possibly break into the mainstream? I'm afraid it's not\ngoing to happen this time lads.\nNT - Responsibilities\nA gravelly textured voice crying out soulfulness, accompanied by a looping bass riff is what you get from NT.\nThe voice is a little too similar to one of Gomez' s two singers, and the cynics amongst you may say that this\nis only getting released due to the inexplicable success\nof the Gomez boys.\nNaem - Parrot Fever\nI'm sorry, but this is just plain and simply boring. It is\nrepetitive and probably could have been made by any\namateur working away at home with their own eight\ntrack recording gizmo. Allegedly Skint records arc meant to be the cream of the crop when it comes to\n'Big Beat' releases. They'd better think again if they want\nto maintain this exalted position.\nThe Yo-yo s You Cot Me Out of My Mind\nVisions of Status Quo leap out of the recesses of my mind where they had been long buried since the violent torture endured at the time of Rocking All Over The\nWorld. This song scared the pants off me we don't want a Status Quo clone, please please please!\nAudioweb - Test The Theory\nI his is yet another single to get lifted from Fireworks City,\nand Audio web come at you head on with an energy\nfuelled track. It's not as stylish as Policeman Skank so I wouldn't recommend going out to buy this unless you want the two extra remixes, with one from the excellent I rees tyler s. Get the album instead if you like this\nand the other previous singles. EJ\nJason\n\n"

By\ncoincidence Mrs. Crow was the only\none from their group to know this\nand therefore she threatened to\nmake it public if my mother spilled\nthe beans about her. It's quite sad\nreally.\"\nBoth lay in silence for a while,\nbut Henry noted with satisfaction\nthat Stella was smiling slightly.\n\"It's totally true, you know,\" he\nsaid. \" Now I 'll tell you about Mrs. Chambers. You remember her, she's the one that told you all about her\nson. You will have found nothing unusual about that, in fact it's an\ninteresting and very touching story.\nBut had you had another conversation with her you' ll have found that\nshe would have said all the same\nthings, because her son is all she\ntalks about. She is infatuated with\nher son, her son's legacy is the reason for her life.\n\" Now you' ll think that even\nthough that might be slightly eccentric, you can't hold it against her, seeing what this son of hers did. Well,\nI'm telling you that everything that\nshe told you everything that she\ntells anyone in fact - is made up, a figment of her imagination.\"\nStella coughed. \"Henry, how can\nyou be so sure of this?\"\n\"I'm telling you, it's the truth\nand not even my mother knows about this. I heard from a very reliable source, but that's another story.\nAnyway, the only true fact in her\nstory is that her son was in the 24th bomber squadron from1941 onwards. After that the fiction\nbegins. He never saved two wounded comrades by single handedly flying\ntheir plane back with a bullet in his\nlung. Neither did he shoot down12 German fighters. And least of all, he\nwas never posthumously awarded\nthe DFC. He did die during the war,\nbut not by crashing his aircraft\nthrough an enemy bomber form a tion. He died whilst he was on leave,\nat home, with his mother, Mrs, Chambers.\"\n\" Oh my God, what happened?\" \"It's so awful. He was having a shower when he must have stepped\non a bar of soap, or something. He\nslipped over and cracked his head on\nthe hot water tap. One hour later his\nmother found water dripping onto\nthe kitchen table, because her son\nwas lying facedown in the plug hole. He had drowned and she had a nervous breakdown immediately after-wards. 1 don't think she ever quite\nrecovered completely.\" Henry paused, almost respectfully, before\ncarrying on. \"As far as 1 know, only\nthree people alive today know about\nthis incident.\"\nAgain they lay in silence for\nawhile, before Henry started up again.\n\" Now I 'll tell you about the last\nsecret, and this time nobody next\ndoor not even the person it concerns knows about it. It concerns\nMrs. Wilson, she's the one that you were talking to before you left. Now she is a particularly unpleasant character but, as fate will have it, is also\nfabulously wealthy. She owns a large\nhouse in Stissex which contains\nmany valuable items of furniture,\nespecially a very important collection\nof paintings. She has a son who is the\nsingle heir to this considerable estate\nand who also happens to be very\ngood friends with John from last\nweek, remember? That'show I know all this. Anyway, this son of hers is\nnot really into his antiques and just\nwants to sell the whole lot and make\na few profitable investments. Now our Mrs. Wilson was very ill at one\nstage and everyone - including her\nson - assumed that it was the end of\nthe milk run for her. He and his\nbrokers began to make elaborate\nplans for the money but were\nthwarted when she made a complete recovery. That was seven years\nago. He is, understandably 1 sup pose, quite bitter - and she knows it.\nOne year ago, purely out of spite she\ngave away an extremely precious\npainting from her collection to some\nobscure gallery. Her son found out\nand hit the roof but there was no th ing he could do about it of course.\nThen, however, he contrived a brilliant plan: he correctly assumed that\nhis mother would make similar gifts\nto various other causes so he commissioned an artist to make copies of\nall the valuable paintings in the col-lect ion, which was basically all of\nthem. Then he carried out several\nclandestine missions into his\nmothers house, at night of course,\nand replaced the original canvases\nwith the copies, whilst leaving the\nframes. His mother is, 1 believe, a little fuzzy in the optical de par nne nt so the whole thing worked liked a dream. I 've been informed that he'snow stripping the house of tapes n ies\nand ceramics.\"\nStella burst into her bright laughter and Henry too was infected. They\nkissed briefly and then for longer,\nand then for longer still. But Henry\nsuddenly started.\n\" What' s the matter?\"\n\"Stella, whilst we were in there\nyou had the baby-phone out.\" His\nvoice was entirely different now, deadpan and ominous,\" Where is it\nnow?\"\" Why, it's here in my pocket\".\nWhat followed was a brief rustle of\nbedclothes and garments and then a deep silence. Stella was the first to\nspeak.\n\"It must have fallen to the floor\"\nA slight tremor was unmistakably\npresent in her voice. Slowly she\nraised herself and peered over the\nedge of the bed.\nCaspar von fred eA story for Dan\n\n"

Unless, of course, you are one of the unfortunates who have exams to do as we speak, for\nwhich you have my sympathy. I hope that you all had a good Christmas, affording you the opportunity to recharge the batteries prior to getting annihilated on New Year's Eve. For my part, as is now tra-d it ional, I ventured to a little shindig at\nAlexandra Palace, bopp in' the night away\nwith all you youngsters (though I was surprised and disappointed to see virtually\nnobody else from IC there). Damn fine\nevening, and well worth the charge of interfering with the Royal Mail that was nearly brought against a good friend of mine, who became locked in a mail\nroom in pursuit of tickets for said event.\nIt's a long story, the details of which can be recounted if you cross my palm with\nbitter.\nSo far, as is to be expected, it's been a bit quiet at Imperial. It is reassuring to\nsee that Estates' passion for signs is not\ndiminished as we approach the millen-niu m. The big silver installation outside\nthe BMS is certainly a departure from the\nblue ones, both in colour and legibility;\nI was beginning to think that my eyes\nwere going, but since I only had them checked a fortnight ago, it must the grey\non grey colour combination. Still, we can't have the medics slumming it with\nthe blue efforts. Perhaps it will be easier\nto read when it has been gilded and encrusted with diamonds. The Union seems to have achieved a bit of a victory\nin its battle for a new licence, giving the\nbuilding a sensible fire limit. Hopefully\nthis will mean an end to the paranoid\nofficiousness displayed by some of the stewards, whose uncharacteristic behaviour was so over the top as to be laugh able. Congratulations to all concerned. Simon Baker\nWith that milestone out the way, you can\nnow focus your efforts on serving consistently good beer, a slightly bigger\nundertaking, I 'll wager.\nThe Euro, for the benefit of those living on Mars of late, has now arrived, with\nmore of a whimper than a bang. Despite\nthe ludicrous pronouncements by various European politicians, who proc l aimed it a success after two hours\ntrading, it is\nfar too early\nto tell if it will\nbe successful.\nOne early\nbenefit has\nbeen to clarify the future\ndirection of the EU. Anyo ne who claimed that\ntalk of federalism was mere anti-Europe prop ag and a should have\nbeen suitably\nhumbled by\nIran co Ger-man state-ment son the\nEuro being the first step\nto full in te gra tion. This, of course, was painfully obvious to many people, who were particularly troubled by the political\ndimension that the French were so keen\nto promote, with talk of creating a currency designed to insulate Europe from the menace of globalisation. It is almost\ntouching that grown-up people still hold\nsuch ridiculous views. The Germans have\nVoice of Reason\nalso made no secret of their desire to use\nthe single currency as a tool to achieve\ntax 'harmon is ation.' For the uninitiated,\nthis is an ingenious plan that enables\nGermany to sustain its crippling rates of corporate taxation by imposing an equally damaging regime on the rest of\nEurope. Many European nations have\nno problem with this, because they\nalready have an equally outmoded and unhelpful tax\nsystem, but\nBritain would pay an incred;ibly high price\ngrave s over mr ^tat t ke ign ty issues\n* y^I, use eh\\ sue h\\, \u00ab \u2022 \u2022 a nine I ho\nargument as\ni if^ j.t0 whether Britain should si;;r..:) to-;-o%^| Euro has\nmoved on. II\nis not so much an issue\nof success or\nfailure of the\ncurrency, but\nwhat would follow from membership, namely an inexorable drift toward federalism. In the words of the great philosopher, is that what you want, 'cos that's what'll ' a ppen. The shifting sands of sovereignty\n(first issue of the year, and he's started\nall iterating) will be an issue this year\nwithin the loose confederation of tribes\nthat is Imperial. Moves are again afoot to\ntinker with the CCUs, a topic which has\ngiven gainful employment to sabbaticals since the dawn of time. Whenever this issue comes up, it inevitably stirs\ngreat passions in all of about half a dozen people across the campus. Even\nby Imperial standards, the supreme indifference that greets any such efforts is\nincredible, and very telling. The recent\nhistory of the CCUs has not been a happy\none, dominated by cock ups and people\nelected on a democratic mandate of a couple of percent of College members, who are incapable of running a bath, let\nalone the RCSU, C& GU and so forth. The\nproblem stems from the fact that the\npeople running these august bodies seem to see their organisations as rivals\nto ICU. Consequently, they establish vast\nnumbers of posts for the most trivial\ntasks, with which they need not con cern themselves. CC Us seek to duplicate all aspects of the Union, so we have welfare officers, academic affairs\nofficers etc etc. Such over-represent a tion merely generates more paperwork\nand committee meetings with precious\nlittle tangible benefit for students. The\nclubs issue raised by the ICU President is\nless controversial, though on balance\nthey would lose none of their identity\nand it would purely make things simpler\nto administer. As it is, the only activities\nthat the CC Us need worry about arc\ncnt s, principally in Freshers' week, their\npublications, however execrable they\nmay be, and alumni relations. Leaner\norganisations, stripped of the legions of\nself opinionated bores so lacking in\norganisational skills that they couldn't even find gainful employ within ICU,\nwould over time become more popular\nand successful, rather than the pitiful\nshadows of their former selves that they\nare at the moment. Presidential Talk-Back\nSince the beginning of term, the Union has been inundated with complaints about the London Transport scheme( thank you Michelle for giving half of your\ntime to them.) Applications have been lost, rejected, stolen and as a result students are having to part with budgeted money. Having complained several times\nverbally, in letters and through the UL U chain to the company with no joy, I decided to try and track down the source\nof their problems. There are very few lines of com plaint for students; the telephone service\nis ineffective; you can find out whether or not your application has been processed or rejected, but complaints are never logged or recorded and the\nphrase 'brick wall' springs to mind. I spoke for quite a long time to one of the\noperators, making them explain the shambles and of course there were 'vary-ing reasons.' The most obvious one was that there\ncould be a dod gy postman taking all\nof the envelopes to\nmake a bit of cash\nbefore they reach\nLT. The solution to\nthis is to send your\napplications in a white envelope. I also found out that\nthey accept cheques, just make them out to London Transport. Lf\nalso blamed the mail house; the forms are processed at\nLT, checking whether they are valid or not\nand then the information is sent onto the\nmailing house who send out the cards.\nDavid Hellard, ICU President\nNext year there is\ndoubt as to whether\nthe same mailing house will be used;\nlet's just hope not.\nThis does still not\naccount for the time\nperiods from sen ding a letter off to the\nrejection letter or\nthe high number of' inadequate' app li cations.\nThere are still\nsome issues that\nneed to be settled\nwith London Transport, the most obvious being access to the scheme for all\nstudents (not just under25 s) and an increase in the period that the card is\nusable to all twelve months of the year,\nas PhD and clinical medicine students are\nstill studying. Hopefully these will be\nresolved by the end of the year within\nthe University of London Union. Until then if you have a complaint\nthe best thing to do is to write to Dennis Torycliff, Chief Executive, London Transport, 55 Broadway London SW1\nHOBD and copy the letter to Richard\nParry, Market Planning if you' re extra\nkeen. If you did not received a card within\nthe usual 28 days and have lost money because of this, or if you have bought\nweekly Travel cards instead of a monthly\none in the expectation that your card\nwould come within the next few weeks and have consequently lost money please email me with the amount and\nreasons at president@ic.ac.uk. If we receive enough letters I 've got a stunt up\nmy sleeve that might have some effect.\n\n"

    "content": "20 Games 18 January 1999\nBlizzard Compilation [Diablo, Starcraft and warcraft II] (PC)\nBlizzard\nYou can always tell when our beloved\nGames Editor is short of material - \"Here\nyou go\" he said \"Blizzard have just released\nthree games in a special pack. Pop off and\ndo me200 words on each.\" And he disappears off to the union bar. Typical.\nThe Human Is weak, ore will smash human\nIhe original Warcraft was released (if\nmemory serves me right) shortly before Command& Conquer, and suffered( somewhat unfairly) due to the blitz of hype surrounding Westwood' s undoubtedly excellent effort. It also lost out to\nC&C in that it didn't have a multiplayer\nmode almost a cardinal sin now, but not\nso uncommon a few years ago. Rather\nthan being set in the near future, Warcraft was set in a mythical land\nwhere tribes of men and ores\nfought it out, competing for gold,\nlumber and land. Warcraft II was released in 1996 and, as the name suggests, it is bigger and better. It\nalso includes that crucial multiplayer component( up to 8 players\ncan hookup together at a time).\nThe graphics are much improved on both the original and C&C, but\nnonetheless are starting to show their age. Still, if you like RPGs\nand C&C, this is well worth the price. This version includes an expansion pack (\"Beyond the Dark\nPortal\", since you asked).\nStarcraft has been one of my\nfavourite games for some time. It is\n(again) very similar to C&C, but is set in\nthe far ends of the galaxy (or somewhere like that).

The level design is\na series of quests, each of which tends to end with the destruction\n(hopefully) of a supra bad die.

I hc article on ecstasy\n[page 7] is, in my opinion, balanced and fair. One argument that has always irritated me in drugs debates is\nthe old 'if you enjoy taking drugs you can't be enjoying everyday life / must be depressed/ are probably mentally unsound' etc etc. Rhubarb and fiddle sticks, as my father would say. best as y is a great drug1 doubt whether any-one who has taken it in amicable sur-rounding s could claim otherwise. Its\nrecreational value is undeniable. I hc question is how high is the price for\nthat rushing euphoria? And the answer is that, with a drug only decades old, we have noway of yet\nknowing its true dangers, or benefits. Whatever your stance on the legal-is ation of cannabis as a recreational drug, I hope that most people applaud the trials shortly to be undertaken at\nPlymouth and Hammersmith hospitals[ page 31. I'm sure that MS sufferers all\nover Britain will, anyway. It's interest-ing to speculate how far the term' medicinal use' could stretch. Headaches? Probably. Mild de pre s sion? Possibly. How about writer's block on a Biology essay? Hopefully. After all, surely creative ills arc as\nimportant as physical ones... Anyway, this leads me nicely on to\nCreative Arts\nThere aren't enough arty people at IC.\nNo surprise there, I hear you say. We all have an artistic side, though, and most of us express it through one medium or another. Most of us probably also think we are' bad' at art\n( whatever that means). The story in\nthis week's issue [ page81 is a welcome( and very good) change from the nitty rationality of science. Imperial does actually have an arts magazine; Phoenix. It is always after\ncontributions, be they prose, poetry,\ndrawings or whatever. Phoenix is now an annual magazine, reduced from the popularity it enjoyed under its\nfounder, II G Wells, by the birth of Felix in 1949...\nFifty Years Ago\n...which means, of course, that Felix is\nhalf a century old this year. Fortuitously for me Felix's birthday is next\nAutumn, after my term of office has\nended, so I 'll avoid the dreaded 'col-lect all the editors from the last fifty\nyears and dump them in a bar' party.\nI was thinking, however, of printing bits and pieces from those early years\nas 1999 progresses. Which is where you come in. If anyone has been at IC\nfor, how shall I put it, a substantial\namount of time, or has relations who were here in the decade after the war,\nlet me know. I'm also missing some years of Felix from the sixties and seventies, if anyone has an attic full of back copies. Write Travel (with no links)\nThose lovely (?!) people who make the Rough Guide series of books have offered me a deal. I print regular blurb\nabout their books, and they'll give a Rough Guide to someone writing a travel feature for Felix. So if you know a bit about some far flung corner of this world, and fancy getting yourself a guidebook on it, let me know. Hopefully we'll be starting in a week or\ntwo. Perhaps a similar scheme involving free bitter would tempt some sports teams to write match reports\nnext week...?\n-Ed\nThe Week Ahead\nMonday Games Meeting 12.30pm For PC, PSX & N64 reviewers.\nFilm Meeting 1pm For all you cinema-going types.\nNews Meeting 1.30pm Tuesday News Meeting 12pm To review progress and discuss new news\nWednesday Late News Meeting 2pm Friday Arts Meeting 12pm For theatre and museum goers\nPhotography & News Meeting 1,20pm For Al I photographers and news writers\nMuslcMeetlng 1.30pm I or ALL single and album reviewers\n\n"

So at the beginning of December Iphone d them to ask what was happening with\nmy application. They told me they had not received it. That is quite hard to believe that this kind of envelope (I mean big, yellow and printed) can get lost...\nBut anyway I sent a second application form on the 3 rd of December with\nthe \u00a31 coin and all the other stuff.

While I agree entirely with\nMs Humphrey that positive disc rim in a tion/affirmative action (e.g. Insisting on admitting 5 0 % women) is a flawed philosophy likely to exacerbate the problems, Ido not share her pessimism pertaining to the wider scientific world.

Your state-ment s seem worded to avoid excessive\noffence, but nevertheless they are a crass\ngeneralisation. It is a question for the psy-cho logi sts, and frankly rather irrelevant in\nthis instance.

At no point should their gender\nhave been an issue.\nIt is easy to explain away the gender\ndisparity at IC with such arguments as\nyours, but these can often be a veil for\n\"the old sexism\", the kind which kept\neminently capable women out of many professions for centuries.

After making a few enquiries, I was told by several sources\nthat permission for such facilities had\nben granted by the relevant College authorities, and that the money to build\nthem had also been sanctioned in spirit.\nThere are many students at Clayp on ds who arrive knowing no-one else\nin England, let alone London, and given\nthe stressful nature of this city, it would be worth the \u00a315k or \u00a320k it would cost\nto build such a small facility, bringing\nClay ponds in line with every other Imperial College hall.\nI have spoken to many of my fellow\nresidents, and they all agree that a common room would improve their quality of\nlife tremendously.

Having persuaded the planning By David Roberts\nPhoto: Jonas The East Wing basement as It presently stands - not a pretty site.\ncommittee of the benefits (both social\nand financial) of the change in outlook,\ncommittee chair Professor Alan Swans on is then believed to have taken up the Union's cause at higher levels,\nresulting in this week's key decision. Ihe additional basement space means that the Union can now go ahead with a comprehensive redevelopment plan, aimed lo provide more adequate provision for club meetings and better student services. Consequently, the East Wing basement will\nbecome home to a new Union Job Shop, alongside the Advice Centre and College Chaplaincy, plus RAG and CA G offices. On the other side of the Quad, a new Media Centre will house Felix, IC\nRadio and STOIC (student TV), plus practice rooms for College bands, and the Science Fiction Society library. The final\nact of the renovation will see the present Beit Hall Bar converted into a ne\\\u00a5\nhome for the Islamic Prayer Room.

Perfect Power Plan Set in Motion\nFew people can have missed the bright\nred temporary boiler house in Dalby\nCourt, but why is it there? It is the intermediate stage in a project to modernise the college's energy supply, which took a significant step towards completion in\nthe week before term, when two new Combined Heating and Power( CHP)\nengines were installed below the Electrical Engineering building.\nFor the past thirty-seven years, the College has been heated by an oil-fired\nboiler plant, supplemented with hot\nwater from the Natural History Museum. The current boilers have reached the end of their working life and are now being replaced. The new system will\ngenerate 7.75MW of electricity, enough to meet most of the College's needs, as\nwell as providing enough steam to heat\nthe campus. Electricity from the National\nGrid will also be used for peak demand and overnight. The new gas fired\nengines are 2 0 m long and weigh forty\ntonnes each; they are expected to reduce the College'sC02 output by 7500\ntonnes per annum. Although the project\nBy Gareth Morgan\nwill cost around eight million pounds, it\nwill save over \u00a3800 000 a year. There is\nalso the promising p possibility of selling\nsurplus electricity to the Grid if this proves\nto be economic. The project is due to be completed over the summer, and will be handed over to College in November.

Since then\nUsher has\nreleased Nice & Slow and My Way, both of which were relatively low key and the man seemed to disappear.\nHave no fear, fans can look forward to a forthcoming single One Day You'll Be Mine as well as Usher's big\nbreak onscreen in that \"extended-Tommy-Hilfiger-com-mercia l\" feature The Faculty in 1999.\nSticking with the teens. Brandy & Monica had a surprising crossover hit with The Boy Is Mine. The song itself not only caught our attention but also provided\nvarious stories about the major rivalry between the two why did Brandy perform solo on The Tonight Show and\nwhat about the punch up at the MTV Video Awards?\nBrandy's second album Never Say Never hit stores in\nJune and Monica' s The Boy Is Mine followed shortly.\nBoth long players have gone on to achieve platinum\nsuccess, but the battle will goon and on. Meanwhile the other teenage sensation Aaliyah (yeah, she's still a teenager) provided us with one of the summer's anthems- a clever concoction of Timbaland beats Arc\nYou That Somebody\n1998 must be remembered as the year of The Fugees,\nall 3 members managed to hit the headlines over the\nyear. Wyclef began the year In the middle of the feud between LL and Canibus, he was dissed as a Bob Marley impostor by LL and as his comeback 'Clef recorded\nWhat's 'Clef Got To Do With It. Gone Till November kept\nus rockin' all through the early months of the year (R Kelly's vocals made the remix) and after a quiet su mmer he returned to end the year on a high note with\na remix of Queens Another One Bites the Dust. Pras\ntook the world by storm with the massive hit Ghetto\nSuperstar as well as giving the Grease theme tune\nsome edge in the form of the catchy Blue Angels, truly\ncementing his place in pop-hop circles. Lauryn penned the excellent A Rose Is Still A Rose for diva and idol\nAretha Franklin, has a baby son Zion and releases what\nwas truly one of the hip-hop albums of the year The\nMiseducation Of Lauryn Hill. No news of any Fugee project in the works but things ain't looking so bad on the\nsolo tip, huh?\nGirl Power may have suffered a setback this year with\nthe loss of Ginger Spice (like we really cared?) but\nthere was no shortage of female talent in the R&B world.\nDestiny's Child were undoubtedly THE girl group of the\nyear. I know y 'al l were gettin your groove on to No, No,\nNo and With Me. The girls had a little lull but returned\nat the end of the year with the amazing Timbaland prod u ced Get On The Bus, their latest release which is\ntaken from the Why Do Fools Fall In Love soundtrack.\nWe first heard her quite stunning vocals on Quincy Jones' album Q's Joo k Joint and this year, lamia did not\ndisappoint with her self-titled debut album. However,\ndue to the lack of promotion, neither sales nor general\nopinion will reflect the quality of this release which is\nso often the case with R&B. Other notable releases\ninclude that from Mya, Kelly Price's stunning Soul Of A Woman and the wicked but underrated Miss Jones\nalbum. On the single tip, who could forget Tatyana Ali's Daydreaming or for the real R'n' B connoisseur, that\nbang in' remix of Taral's How Can I Get Over You, it's times like this when you know LL's still got the skill z.1 he UK didn't fair badly either on the lady front with Beverly Knight and Kele Le Roc breaking through with\ntheir albums Prodigal Sista and Everybody's Somebody\nrespectively. Beverly hadn't dropped anything since\nFlavour ofF he Old Skool but she came back with one of the summer blockbusters Made It Back, Redman helped on rap and Beverly you definitely back. Hind a Hicks came from nowhere at the start of the year and\nimmediately started hitting us with tune after tune. How can you forget You Fhink You Own Me. With Shola Ama and these three young ladies as well as The Honeyz? It looks a bit good for the R&B scene Another Level are on another level,\nmuch props must go to the four\nboys, they produce tunes which\nreally are doing it, their vocals\nare as good as anybody else\nout there and the production\nfrom Blacksmith is top draw.\nTheir ability to crossover and bring a street edge to the charts\nis incredible, record bosses must\nbe kicking themselves for turning\nthese boys down, remember they had\nto go to the States to get a deal. Be Alone\nNo More started it all off, but for me Freak Me\nwas right on point and these boys just keep coming! Will Smith set the scene alight with his own brand of\npop hop and we thought long and hard about whether\nyou could really call Will Smith an MC? Well not really,\nbut with infectious hits like Men In Black, Gettin Jiggy\nWith It, Just Fhc 2 Of Us and Miami, how could you hate\nthis guy? You gotta check out his latest flick \"Enemy Of The State\", 1998 was his year, and he's storming into\n1999 too.\nRap went back to its roots this year. To the good ol' Boogie Down( aka. The Bronx) where it all started. The likes\nof Big Pun, Fat Joe, Lord Tariq & Peter Gun z hit us with\nfloor fillers such as Still Not A Player and Deja vu\n(Uptown Baby). Elsewhere, Cam' ron represented for\n110th Street and above (Harlem World, baby! Check out\nthe excellent remix of Horse & Carriage). 1M.O.R.E. blew\nup Ihe clubs with Superthug Queens style e and we even had upstate representation from DMX, two albums\nin a year, someone been busy. Brooklyn in tha house,\nwell sorta, A Tribe Called Quest decided to call it a day\nwith the release of their 5th and final album The Love\nMovement. Black Star continued to uphold the \"hip-hop-with-a brain\" tradition with their much anticipated debut\nset- No Alizc or Benjamins Here and LA based Black\nEyed Peas had us all shouting \"That's the joint, that's the jam!!\". A mention has to go to Jurassic Five and their\nalbum J5, these boys came along and have lit up hip-hop.\nMusic moguls/producers made releases but none really\nlived up to the hype, there was JD's Life in 1472 (hold\nup though, we did all dig Sweetheart, if only for the\nvideo) and Master P's MP Da Last Don. Incidentally, both\nproducers have decided not to release any further solo\nmaterial and will concentrate solely on their recording\nartists from now on thank God for that!! Missy\ntook us one step closer to that filth-pit known as pop-hop with a collaboration with Mel B aka. Scary Spice,\nyeah we all loved that song/ Want You Back not! Word\nhas it that the Spice Girls flew over to the US recently\nto talk to leddy Riley about plans for their next album, don't say I didn't warn ya!\nThere was no significant contribution from THAT man; Puffy, until the end of the year and boy, did he hit us\nhard - showcase at London' s newly opened Sound Republic (which he sunk some; money into), perform ance at the MOBO' s and3 new studio albums from\nfaith, lot a land112. Al last the wicked Love Like This\nwas given a release and laid down its claim as tune of\nthe year. Faith's album Keep The Faith was packed\nwith tunes and will certainly goon to classic status. Ihe total album was a seri-o us disappointment, but 112s Room 112 made up for it and\nmade me think twice about\nthe boys' ability.\nShe ec eeee sh, some people\ntake their time, don't they?\nIt's taken 3 years for R Kelly to\nwrite and release his new dou ble album R, but if you heard it\nyou know it's worth the wait. That,\nthough, still doesn't top the 8 years\n's taken Whitney Houston to release\nonly her 4th studio album, My Love Is Your Love.\nGuys, it's real nice to have you back and all but do you\nthink you could hurry the hell up next time?!\n1999! Watch out for new albums from the street soul\nmasters Blackstreet, the beautiful trio TLC, to xy Brown,\nQueen of R&B MaryJ, Men Of Vision and of course the\nmuch awaited second set from D'Ang clo. On a British\ntip I'm looking forward to hearing some new stuff\nfrom Nine Yards, Kleshay, Kele Le Roc and even the All\nSaints. Bring it on!1999 THA BOMB! Kidphobce & Milcn\n\n"

We cemented our position at the top of ULU Division 3 and are now in a great\nposition to reach the unparalleled heights of division 2. Of the8 league\ngames remaining, the fourth's should be aiming to win at least 5 or 6.\nThis game exploded into life in the\nfirst few minutes as IC raced into a two goal lead with goals by Aiden, following good work by Steve and Derek,\nand an embarrassed UCL defender. From then on the rest of the game was really a formality, the only question being how many could IC score. The answer: five, the extra goals coming from Adam, Nim a and a penalty from Gur m( who else could have finished so\nclinically form12 yards?). A mention to\nDave Wishart who was\" f** ing amazing\"( his words) but in mine\" f** ing shite\" as\nhe gave away a penalty which was crap pil y saved by Stu and UC scored\nwith the follow up.

    "content": "18 January 1999 Film\nReviews St Competition\n71 \u2022 * * \u2022\nStarring : Sean Gullette, Mark Margolis, Ben Shenkman, Pamela Hart\nDirector: Darren Aronofsky\nAs well as gaining world-wide critical praise, 7th as secured first-time director Darren Aronofsky\nthe Directing Award for Dramatic Composition at the Sundance Film\nFestival. With these accolades in mind I was expecting a visual feast when I entered the cinema. I was not di sap pointed. Aronofsky demonstrates his\namazing command of cinematography, showcasing non-linear editing( MTV\nstyle, epilepsy inducing, cutting) and some bizzar e camera set-ups (at times\nstrapping cameras to various actors\nbody parts). But apart from all these\ndoubtless fascinating and innovative\n'tricks' is there a film underneath the audio-visual bombardment? The answer is are sounding yes -with solid performances from the supporting cast ( who mainly consist of the director's friends and family), and Sean\nGullette's impressive display as a man spiralling into paranoia. The film demands self-mutilation and a series of painfully\nrealistic fits from Gullette, which he duly\ncompletes with a manic stare reminiscent\nof Nicholson's glory days in One Hew\nover the Cuckoos Nest..\n19\nIntroduction to mad scientists. No 1 - the slinky obsession\nWhile the plot sometimes does get\na little tenuous,( an overly aggressive\nWall Street firm and a Kabbalah sect try\nto unlock the secrets of their holy texts)\nthe extreme pace at which the film's storyline advances forces you to put such\ngripes aside and concentrate on what's going on on-screen. Considered as a thriller the film works well, keeping the\nviewer attempting to second guess the\ntrue motives of the people surrounding Gullette - whether they actually care for\nhim or are only aiding him to feed their\nown selfish needs. Whether the film is\nscience fiction is another matter entirely,\nso don't expect Mulder and Scully or any\nwarp drives to start appearing.\nIf you're allergic to strobes or value\nyour ears, don't see this film - everyone\nelse can sit back and fry their brains,\nhappy in the knowledge that they are\nwatching a great film.\n\u2022 Joel.\nWin cinema tickets with the\nKENSINGTON\nAs ever, those lovely people at the Odeon Kensington (no 9 or no10 bus,\nin case you're interested) give you and a friend the opportunity to see a film for\nfree. For a change, however, this week the film in question will come as a surprise (OK, so I don't know what the prize\nis yet, but rest assured that there will be one).\nAnyhow, to win a pair of tickets all\nyou have to do is answer the following( deceptively simple) question: Name all the actors who have\nplayed Anakln Skywalker (In any one\nof the four Star Wars Installments\ncurrently In existence).\nEmail your answer to film.felix@\nic.ac.uk before6 pm on Fu cs day19 th January to be in with a chance. Winners\nwill be drawn at random from the virtual\nhat.\nThe winners of issue 1131 's Meetjoe\nBlack competition were:\nSamaher Alahmed\nImogen Lucas\nRJchard Hopkins\nHelen Coates\nBen Crabshaw\nThey all correctly identified that Brad Pitt\nplayed a German mountaineer( with a very dod gy accent) in Seven Years in\nTibet\nA huge number of entries were received for the Psycho competition, all\ncorrectly identifying that Anthony Perkins\nplayed Norman Bates in Hitchcock's( far\nsuperior) 1960 original. The first five\nnames to be picked out by the random email selector were:\nYin Loong Chao\nKatie Hopkins\nLauren Robinson\nScott Edmunds\nBen Pickersglll\nCould all p rise winners please drop into\nthe Felix office (in the south-east corner\nof Beit Quad) sometime this week to collect their prizes.\nPDATE\nGood Will\nHunting\nAmongst all the Hollywood success stories of last year, Matt Damon and Ben\nAfleck strode to the front of the pack\nwith this brilliantly moving film.\nTwo years ago, so the story goes,\nthe pair were in their final year at Harvard and decided they wanted to be actors. Trouble was they didn't think\nthey were good enough to get cast in\nanyone else's film, so they wrote their\nown. That script turned into Good Will\nHunting, and two years later they're\nOscar winning millionaires, dating Gwyneth Paltrow and Winona Ryder and\namongst the biggest stars in Hollywood.\nLucky, lucky bastards.\nThe ice Storm\nDespite a desperately sad ending (make-sure you buy five boxes of Kleenex\nbefore watching the movie) and a deceptively simple premise, Ang Lee's film has been( justifiably) showered in\ncritical plaudits.\nWhilst a seventies-set drama sur-rounding a crisis-laden suburban family\nmight not sound like rivetting viewing,\nan eclectic array of Hollywood's finest\n(the likes of Kevin Kline, joan Allen, Elijah Wood and Sigourney Weaver) bring\nThe Ice Storm to life with a near perfect\ndisplay of ensemble acting. Add in brilliant direction, a soul destroying script\nand that ending, and you're left with\nwhat can only be described as a classic\npiece of film-making.\nAnastasia\nDisney may have come in for some flak\nrecently with their none too accurate re-tellings of Pocohontas and Mulan, but\nTwentieth Century fox' s Anastasia is on a completely different level. For starters,\nthis Anastasia isn'tex ecu te d instead\nshe's chased around Paris by the henchmen of the evil Rasputin. Hmmm. On the other hand, with Meg Ryan, John\nCusack, and Kelsey Grammer on voiceover duty, there's certainly no expense\nspared, and at times the end product is\nbeautifully drawn. I low ever, it still lacks\nthe charm and sense of fun that gives\nDisney classics a real crossover into the;\nadult market. D Dave\n\n"

    "content": "8 Fiction 18 January 1999\nStella did not want to be here, that\nwas all that she was thinking about.\nShe did not want to be here, sitting\non this lumpy sofa, drinking this\ntea, trying to make conversation with\nthese impossible people. She would have paid a lot of money to have\nbeen somewhere else, anywhere else.\nShe was at her mother-in-law's, who had issued the invitation almost\nfive months previously. Stella had\ntaken an instant dislike to the flat,\nand ten minutes later she was positively repulsed by it. However, what was worse were the people who were\nin it. They were a few selected friends\nof Henry'smother: seven ancient and shrivelled women, whose hus bands had without exception expired\nmany years previously. These women( Henry'smother had to be regrettably included) were so grossly conceited and contemptuous that it was\nverging on the comical.\nStella, however, was finding it\neverything else but comical at this\nmoment. She was sitting on the edge\nof the sofa and was struggling through the last ruins of a conversation with the person on her right.\nIt was clear that the dialogue had\ndied some time ago yet she was stubbornly trying to carry it on. Part of\nthe problem was the fact that her\nconversational partner looked and\nsmelt like she had been living in a bottle of gin for the past ten years.\nWith a sudden compulsion, Stella\nabruptly stopped the monologue and turned to her left to find the person sitting there staring at her.\nStella's left neighbour had a very\ninteresting mouth: it looked like it\nhad been yanked shut with a length\nof string, and twitched and protruded from the sunken face as if\nsomeone was still pulling the string.\nThe old woman's eyes were fixed\non Stella's and it actually looked like\nshe was going to say something. Fire\nthe cannons, thought Stella, one of\nthese crones is actually going to start\na conversation with me for once.\n\"Tell me,\" the woman wheezed,\n\"you were married in December, is\nthat correct?\"\nStella nodded hesitantly. \"Yes...\"\n\" And you have a child named Joys in, the Attic James?\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\" Mrs. May told me that he was\nborn in March.\" Stella was not so\nforthcoming with a response. She\nwas slightly uneasy as to where this\nwas leading.\n\"Yes...\" she said again. The old\nwoman paused, as if she was trying\nto achieve some effect.\n\" Don't you think June or thereafter would have been more appropriate?\" Stella had to think for a moment and then realised that the woman was referring to the fact that James\nhad been born less than nine months\nafter her wedding. For a moment anger threatened to crush her composure and she struggled to remain\ncivilised.\n\" We are all entitled to our op in ions,\" she said curtly.\n\" Where is the child now?\" the\nwoman croaked.\n\"He's asleep next door.\"\" Alone?\" \"Yes, alone.\" There was an uneasy\nsilence between them, which the old\nwoman seemed to regard as a kind\nof victory. Stella decided to continue.\n\"But I can hear if he so much as\nsqueaks, look.\" She briefly squirmed on the sofa and extracted a radio-like\nobject from her jeans pocket. There\nwas a soft but clearly audible rasping emanating from it, \"We call it the\nbaby phone. There's another like it by\nJames's bed. It transmits even the\nslightest sound to this one. Listen,\nyou can hear him snoring...\" Stella\nheld it out for the woman to exam ine. For one moment, it seemed there was a gleam of curiosity in the\nold lady's eyes and her withered hand was already hovering to reach\nfor it. Then she started and her hand\ndropped back into her lap like a dead fish. She gave a kind of snorting sound.\" How can you entrust the safety\nof your child to an electric box like\nthat?\" She grated.\nStella regarded her adversary\nwith a mixture of disbelief and almost pity. Then the sight of her\nhusband rising from his chair across\nthe room caught her eye. Henry met her gaze, winked, and slunk though\nthe door. \"Excuse me,\" Stella snapped\nand followed him with great relief.\nShe found him sprawled on the\ndouble bed in the adjacent room, beside the cot where James was still\nsnoring away through his tiny pink\nnose. With a resigned sigh she lay\nbeside him and rested her head on\nhis chest, which tremor ed with silent\nchuckles.\n\" Don't say what you' re about to\nsay,\" he whispered. \"You were about\nto say that you would rather have\nwashed a hundred dead camels than\ncoming here today, amI right?\"\n\" Near enough,\"\" OK, but would you have also\ngiven them mouth to mouth?\" \"Look, I'm sorry Henry, but I'm not in the mood for this.\"\n\"Alright, Alright,\" and they lay for\na while in silence.\nAfter a while Henry spoke again,\n\"I think it's time I let you into some\nsecrets,\" Stella stirred on his chest.\n\" Are you in the mood for some really\njuicy secrets?\"\n\" Go on then.\"\n\" Maybe1 should have told you before we came, it would have certainly cheered you up. Where shall\nwe start?...urn...OK, you remember that woman who you were sitting\nbeside last time, the one with the\nreally curly died hair, yes? Her name\nis Mrs. Crow and she has a rather\nunfortunate health problem. A problem which none of the others know\nabout, bar my mother that is. You\nsee, she has a quite large and very\npainful cyst on her...urn...well, to put\nit crudely, on her arse. And, er... to\nbe accurate, it's in her arse.\"\n\"Henry, why on earth would I want to know that?\"\n\"Listen, it gets a lot worse.\nBecause of this,..this...THING she\ncan't wipe herself like normal people\nafter having a... well, you know what.\nAnyway, so instead of wiping she\nwashes herself and at home she has\na bidet installed for this purpose.\nHowever, when she's at other places\nthere sometimes aren't bidets\naround, so....\"\n\"I really don't like the sound of\nthis.\"\n\"...So she has to use the sink.\"\nHenry paused and sav our ed the\nmoment. He knew very well that the flat in\nwhich they were in - his mother's flat - did not contain a bidet. He\nwaited for a comment from Stella\nbut as there was none he continued.\n\" One day Mrs. Crow went to the loo\nhere and forgot to lock the bath-room door. My mother entered the\nbathroom unawares and caught her\nin flagrant edel ic to, contorted over\nthe sink - you can imagine the scene.\n\n"

Sarah Rutt's personal perspective on the love drug\n...so here Iam, right at the front of the stage in\nthe centre of the dancefloor, right in the middle of this breakdown meltdown which is going on forever\nthis is never gonna end and the lights are in my eyes\nor perhaps my eyes are closed PUT YOUR HANDS IN\nTHb AIR and learn how to fly COM LON NOW GLI YOUR HANDS IN THb AIR we're almost there it's nearly time nearly time and wo ah there I just lost my head somewhere can't feel my feet but everybody' s shouting hey just look around and see FIVE the smiles tOUR the lights THREE the choon z TWO the crowd ONE here we go are you ready for this\nbecause it's NINETEEN NINETY NIIIIIIINE....\n...and then, somewhere in the midst of the hugs and the grins and the' happy new year's that break-down finally comes to an end, the beat kicks back\nin, and there'll be no sitting still for at least two hours.\nYou know the feeling: the music rips right through you, you're getting mile long tracers off your hands, and, apart from a spot of jaw ache thanks to that gum you can't stop chewing, you' ve never felt so fuckin' amazing mate in your life. You know damn well\nyou'll feel like shit tomorrow, but that doesn't matter right now, does it? After all, the comedown is a fair price for such a blinding night out, and that brain-cell meltdown will only last a day. Won't it?\nfet me tell you about Adam,a salesman. I met him in the street: he came rushing up to me one summer afternoon, big grin and wide eyes, and asked straight out if I knew where he could get Es,\ndope, even a wrap of speed. No,I said, I quit the stuff a while back. His face fell. Sort of. The grin\nwas still there, as If painted on, and his eyes were still wide, blank, staring. He started to talk triple\nspeed, in the way that pilled-up people do, and I just\nassumed he was off his face. More Es? He sounded to me like he' d taken a month's worth already.\nHe asked me my name, and told me his. Then whether I knew of any decent clubs locally: he was new to the area. Two minutes later he was asking my name again, and again in another twenty sec-on ds, and again a minute after that. \"I' mAdam, how're ya doin'?\" occurred at least five times in ten minutes. It turned out( several times) that he was-3,4 Methylene-dl oxy N methyl amp heta ml ne do you really want this swimming around Inside your body?\nn't even on anything right then, he just took a few pills most weekends, and had been doing so for the past year. Or three. He couldn't really remember. Two' I' mAdam's later I couldn't take anymore, and walked off. Had I seen him again a minute after-wards I doubt he would' vc remembered ever meet-already.\nOkay, so ecstasy is dangerous. But, on the other hand, I'm not suggesting that we can all live\nup to the government's ideal of supreme will power, and resist the stuff altogether. I'm not advocating the use of drugs here, but people w/7/ta kc them, and they have a right to know where they stand. Ih codd pill every few months probably( and note I say pro b ably) won't do you much harm provided you don't mix it with other drugs, especially alcohol, and watch\nyour water intake (a pint an hour is about right). But,\nif you're taking ecstasy most weekends, or if you feel\nthat you need a pill to enjoy yourself, then you' redoing yourself some serious damage. Get yourself\nsorted, mate, and get yourself off it. If you don't, the chances are that you'll become another Adam, another vegetable whose thoughts run in ever-decreasing circles. I don't want that. You don't want that. As the saying goes, choose life.\ning me. If that's not brain damage, I don't know what is.\nAnd if you want 'hard' evidence, you can have that,\ntoo; results of recent studies on ecstasy users strongly suggest that prolonged use can result in\nlong-term memory loss, depression, and paranoia. That's not just forgetful n css and mope y feelings on comedown day: brain damage is for life. Adam may think he' s enjoying himself, but I suspect that within another year or so, he'll be incapable of doing any-thing more complex than the washing up. The upside is that he'll wash all the plates at least twice,\nbecause he can't remember that he's done them If you would like advice, information or counselling to do with drugs, call the National Drugs\nHelpline on0800776600. The service is free, confidential, and Is operated 24 hours a day.\n\n"
