    "content": "JANE AND THE BELVEDERES\nIt must have been the shell-shock. Three\nhundred persons feeling the urge to twitch a big-toe after the initial impact of the colourful\nsupport band, The Opposition', opened on a lively number with lively lighting and lively\naction - no sleeping bags on this set. The\ntracks were not introduced by either band on \u2022\nthis occasion, so I can't really recount any,\nbut the band were professional, very\ncompetent and coupled with a smooth, easy\nchat here and there this calm, untroubled air\nflowed from stage to an almost spell-bound\naudience. Best described as new-wave/mild\nheavy metal, these successful four used,\nquiet, pensive themes to great effect in even\nvery loud tracks with a style not dissimilar to\ncertain Zeppelin numbers.\nCheers persisted through to the end and an\nencore was certainly demanded by a now\nactive and eager crowd. Encore.\nJane Aire at IC\nPhoto by Nigel Tooby\nNow potentially nasty, sarcastic reviewers\nlike me like nothing better than a few flaws in\na show to play on, without which the reviews\ntend to be boring. So now I 'll have to be just\nthat, because Jane Aire deserves to be raved\nabout. Never in my two years at IC have I seen\na crowd as crazy as this one, nor for ten years\nor more has such a good sound filled an IC\nconcert hall. Jane came on and took them by\nthe ecstasy chords and she and the band\nplayed them up, up and up, until people were\nmounting each other and bopping two high.\nThe tension escalated until near hysteria\nbroke out when the set ended, cheers for\nencore were deafening and Jane Aire rose to\nthe occasion with a magnificent finale to a truly excellent, musical original and above all\nemotional set.\nThis time her music was free - next time\nyou'll have to pay through the nose for it, if\ntheir performance here was anything to go by\nbecause this act are bound for stardom.\nNigel Tooby\nCHESS\nCLUB\nIC played their first game ofthe new season\nin the premier division of the Middlesex\nLeague against Wood Green 1 on Thursday,\n11th October. The start was at 7:00pm, but\ndue to a misunderstanding, the opposition\narrived fifteen minutes late, claiming the start\nwas at 7:15pm. It turned out that we were right\nand so they started the match with a time\ndisadvantage.\nThe match was over eight boards. On board\none, Philip Maguire had a bad opening and\nlost quickly to a very strong opponent\n(graded 225). On board two, Jon Freeman\nhad a quiet game and drew fairly easily. Due\nto the misunderstanding over the start Pete\nAnderson's opponent on board three, turned\nup over half an hour late and so Pete won by\ndefault. On board four, Tong had a reasonable game until both players reached\ntime trouble and Tong blundered and\neventually lost.\nOn board five, I had a good opening\nwinning a pawn and achieving what should\nhave been a won position. Unfortunately, two\nmoves later, I dropped a rook for a bishop and\nwas eventually ground down to a lost\nposition, which was adjourned, but has now\nbeen resigned. On board six, J. Bacon played\na passive game, obtaining no counter\nchances on the queen side and lost to a devastating king side attack, resigning on a checkmate in one. On board seven, S. Rouhani dropped a pawn early on in a complicated combination, eventually\nregaining it with good chances and then\nagreed a draw. On board eight, Chris Callow\nwent into a combination on move eight and\nrealized on move eleven that it dropped a piece for two pawns. He played on gallantly,\nadjourning in a double-edged position, but\nafter some home analysis decided it was lost\nand resigned, making the final score:\nIC1 2, Wood Green 1 6\nBob Coles\nNo, we doi rts tecL a b&k. on difficult\nequations carted 'Quadrapherwo '\nGO\nCLUB\nAt a general meeting of the Recreational\nClubs Committee on Thursday, 11th October, It was decided to declare the GO Club as dormant; hence the club's grant has\nbeen frozen and any financial transaction\nmade on the Club's behalf will not be\nrecognized by RCC.\nHowever, anyone who wishes this club to\ncontinue and Is prepared to take over Its\nrunning is requested to contact the RCC Exec\n(via letter rack In Vlnlon Office).\nIf no one Is prepared to take on\nresponsibility for this club, then a decision\nmay be made to close it down altogether at\none of the RCC meetings early next academic\nyear, but If someone Is prepared to take on\nthe responsibility then the club may be\ndeclared active and Its grant will be unfrozen.\nJOHN TIDY\nRCC Chairman\nORIENTEERING\nSeveral hundred oriente ers descended on\nthe unsuspecting inhabitants of Hampstead\nlast Sunday morning, for the GLC championships on Hampstead Heath. This\nprovoked considerable interest among those\nenjoying more leisurely and traditional\npastimes. One man who was out walking his\ndog, demanded, \"What are you people\ndoing? You're not even all running in the\nsame directions!\" A lady sunning herself on a park bench was heard to remark, \"I shall die\nof curiosity in a minute: why is everybody\nrunning about, holding those leaflets'?\"\nMembers of the IC Orienteering Club\nattempted courses of 5.0, 8.3 or 10.0km. The\ntough 10km course was made even more\ndifficult, because some base person, or\nmaybe somebody's dog, removed one of the\ncontrols. Despite being hindered by this, Ken\nWarren clocked a respectable 75mk i41 sec.\nThis was the IC's first outing on a Sunday this\nseason, and generally speaking our times\nreflected a lack of practice.

    "content": "Dear Colin,\nWe would just like to correct\nsome facts wrongly written in last\nweek's FELIX, under Malcolm\nBrain's article.\nSurely, the purpose of a duty\nofficer is to ensure that there is no\ntrouble in the bar and when there\nis (and not before!) correct the\nsituation. It is also the duty\nofficer's responsibility to assist\nthe head barman in any way\npossible.\nIt is not their duty to effect\ntrouble (perhaps by calling the\npolice) when no trouble has been\ncaused.\nWe would also like to point out\nthat the ex R SMU member quoted\nin the article did NOT make any\ncomment in verbal form to the\nduty officer that evening. Thus an\nordinary citizen of the street, as a guest of an IC student was thrown\nout of the bar for no reason at all.\nA duty officer must have the\ntolerance and integrity to handle a situation - let alone handle one's own emotions.\nThe question of abuse on that\nparticular evening is grossly\nexaggerated, in fact invented.\n' The final incorrect point comes\nin the first paragraph of this topic,\nwhereby, it states that the \"match\nhaving been arranged mainly by\nR SMU.\" Since no union money\nwas spent on the arrangements\nand that non students also\nassisted in these, we don't think it\nis right to quote R SMU as the\norganizers.\nYours sincerely,\nR SMU Exec Com m Dear Colin,\nYour letters page is probably not\nthe best place to air my views on\nthe Rag Mag, but I feel I must reply\nto last week's letter, which grossly\nmisrepresents the facts. Firstly, I protest strongly to the\nlabel \"blatantly sexist\" - I have\nstudied it thoroughly and can find\nnothing which discriminates against either sex - except\npossibly the cross-word, which I suppose could be described as\n'degrading' to men. (Indeed Justin\nNewland's incredible story last\nweek was a thousand times more\nsexist.)\nAs for it being racist, here are the\nfacts: it contains one 'Rastus' joke,\nmentions the word 'wo g' once,\nand has a series of lightheaded\njokes - eight Jewish (not including\nthe Volkswagen' joke, which I 'll\nmention later), nine Irish jokes\nand one Scots - not to mention\nseveral aimed at the English.\nPlease let me stress that these are\nJokes and I doubt if the Irish\namong us would label us\n\"bigoted\" for such fun-poking.\nThis is far less racist than the\naverage Rag Mag.\nHowever, on the sick jokes, I agree, they are depraved, very\nsick and I personally find them\ntotally unfunny (though many\ndisagree oh this). What's more\nseveral( the 'Volkswagen',\nMoorgate and Aberfan jokes in\nparticular) are offensive, and\nChris, Malcolm and I did all in our\npower to stop them being\nincluded.\nUnfortunately, we failed, which\nis why we dissociated ourselves -so that all complaints etc. should\ngo to the person responsible -Steve Marshall.\nI certainly have never made the\nexcuse \"....that by the time I realized what was happening it\nwas too late.\" - perhaps if the\nwriters of last week's letter had\ntried to find out the facts of the\ncase, they wouldn't have made\nsuch mistakes.\nA far greater error, however, is to\nstate that \"....such an obviously\ntalented person as Mr Marshall\nshould have produced a Rag Mag\nwithout foreseeing the obvious\nconsequences.\" I agree he has\ntalent - one only has to glance at\nthe layout of this Mag, or the RCS Handbook to see that, but he most\ncertainly did foresee, if not\nactually encourage the \"obvious\nconsequences\", as throughout\nproduction he took the attitude,\nfirstly, that he was the Editor and\nnot even ICU Exec had the right to\ncurtail hs editorial freedom and\nsecondly, that this Rag Mag should be as depraved and\nobscene as he could make it\nwithout it actually being prose cut able. Also, just for the record, I did\nconsider acting to stop it being\nprinted, but felt I hadn't the power\nto do so, without consulting at\nleast my committee, if not aUG M. Perhaps this is a fault of mine that\nI would try to represent the views\nof those who elected me, as\nopposed to those who simply use\ntheir posts to give power to their\nown personal opinions.... Rachel Snee (NOT Ms!)\nRag Chairman\nPS - As we have so far been\nconcerned with the bad points of\nthe Mag, may I also put forward\nthe good: it is superbly laid out,\nexcellently printed, contains many very funny jokes and some\nof the best cartoons I 've seen.\nMany consider it easily the best\nRag Mag they've ever read.\nDear Sir,\nI know that this is the permissive\nage, and I consider myself to be\nfairly broad minded, but there are\nlimits! I am of course referring to\nthe Rag Mag. Apart from the\ncrossword, which is blatantly\nobscene, there are some jokes\nwhich are somewhat offensive\nalso. One which particularly\ncomes to mind is the one referring\nto the number of Jews that can get\ninto a Volkswagen. Any, indeed\nevery Jew has the absolute right\nto be deeply offended by such a 'joke', and for that matter, so has\nthe Volkswagen car company.\nI realize that the staple diet of\nRag Mag humour is sex, and the\ntype of remarks that comment on\nthe intelligence of the Irish etc.,\nbut some level of decency must be\nmaintained. If not, then it\ndegenerates from being a humorous publication into one of\nunmitigated filth and as such\ndamage the reputation of the\nCollege.\nIn his editorial, Steve Marshall\nsays: \"I have attempted to\nproduce a Rag Mag that is actually\ndifferent to ALL others.\" In this\nrespect, he has most certainly\nsucceeded, as I am sure that there\nis not a great many Rag Mags that\nhave been refused by a publisher\non grounds of obscenity, and has\nbeen disowned by the President,\nDeputy President and Rag Chairperson of its own College\nUnion!\nI therefore thoroughly endorse\nthe views of Aftab Gujral et al\n(FELIX, 12 Oct).\nPhil Merryman\nDear Sir,\nI think it is time that several\nUnion officers spent more time\nworrying about matters of direct\nconcern to the majority of\nstudents ie, accommodation and\ncollege catering, rather than\nworrying themselves about foreign students' fees.\nI would like to draw your\nattention to some facts about\nforeign students fees, as\npublished in the 'Financial Times'\nof 10 Aug. The government\ncurrently spends \u00a3100million on\nsubsidies for foreign students. It\nmust be considered wrong that\n60% of the average unit cost of a foreigners further education is\nmet by the UK taxpayer. The increase of 77% for 1977/78\nand the proposed increase of 33%\nthis autumn still doesn't go far\nenough. In order for a foreign\nundergraduate to pay the full cost\nof his education a further 25%\nincrease is required to bring the\nfees up to the true cost of \u00a32,350.\nThis year government cuts\nrequire \u00a3200million to be trimmed\noff education expenditure. What\nbetter way of doing this than to\nreduce the current \u00a3100million subsidy.\nAbout 60% of foreign students\ncome from countries who could\neasily afford the large suggested\nincrease in fees. This increase\nneed not necessarily reduce the\nnumber of foreign students,\nwhich currently stands at 82,000.\nI do not wish to prevent students\nfrom poor countries from studying here, but I think that\ncountries such as the rich oil producing Arab countries, who don't know what to do with all\ntheir money, should pay a realistic\nprice rather than expect the\nBritish to subsidize them. I am\nproposing a 'means test' to be\napplied to their native country. Do\npeople not realize that the\n\u00a3100million government subsidy\ndoes not come out of a bottomless\npit, but out of everybody's pocket.\nYours sincerely,\nJC Pearson\nDear Sir,\nThough the recent U GM was my\nfirst, I feel it necessary to\ncomment on the way in which the\noccupation motion was passed.\nThe supporters of the motion,\nwere obviously expecting to take\npart in the occupation that\nafternoon, already prepared\nthemselves to miss all lectures\nuntil further notice. The opposers\nhowever, as the sit-in would not\ndirectly involve them, felt they\ncould not afford to miss their\nlectures. Thus as the actual vote\nwas taken after 2:30pm, the\nmajority of the people remaining\nin the hall were those supporting\nthe motion. Therefore the resulting vote cannot be said to be\na true representation of the\nfeelings of IC students\nI would also suggest that the\nunion exec were too concerned in\nbeing the first union to take any\nsort of positive action and let their\nimpatience take priority over a fair debate and vote.\nYours sincerely,\nJon Marsden/Jon Fewtrell\nME1\nDear Colin,\nWe feel that after this letter,\nJustin Newland will strike us as a very articulated young man.\nHowever, with reverence to his\narticle in FELIX 529, and indeed in\nthe words of Philip Bliss (1838-1876), viz., \"Hold the fort, for I am\ncoming,\" might one not waiver in\nthe juxtaposition of such relentless verbosity with a simplistic and linguistically un adventurous discourse on the\nantics and anim ad versions of\nthose catalytic young fresher s? Indeed, was Beaujolais some\npsychic predecessor of the\ncon cp is cent Anne? Is Justin\nNewland merely a gnome de\nplume for some semantically\nmercurial messenger with corn of\nplenty?\nYours,\nTwo Third-year Mathematicians\n(names'and addresses denied on\nrequest)\n\n"

    "content": "CANOE CLUB TAKES ON THE ALPS\nThis summer in mid-July, IC Canoe Club\nset off on its first ever trip to the French Alps.\nIt took the club two days to travel to the first\nriver to be paddled, the Isere. The club set up\ncamp next to the river at Bourg St Maurice,\nwhere a slalom course is always available on\nthe river. This course provided a great deal of\nexcitement during the stay there, particularly\nbecause of its closeness to the camp.\nThe club also paddled three down river\nstretches on the Isere below Bourg St\nMaurice. These sections were of\nconsiderably varying difficulty and thus there\nwas water suitable for everyone on the trip.\nThe first section from Bourg St Maurice down\nto Landry was of moderate difficulty and\nthoroughly enjoyed by most of the club\nmembers. The next section from Landry to\nBellentre was the easiest and was paddled by\nall canoeists on the trip. The last section\nbetween Bellentre and Aime was by far the\nmost difficult but was successfully completed\nby the more experienced paddlers. After five days in Bourg St Maurice, the\nclub moved South to the Durance. This river\nwas paddled in two stages. The first from St\nCrepin down to St Clement, was the easier of\nthe two. At St Clement, a change-over took\nplace and the second group carried on down\nto the famous rapid, the Rabioux, near\nChateauroux. The canoeists who had not\npaddled, then had their turn to follow the\nothers through the Rabioux. This rapid\nengrossed the club for some time, with some\nparticularly spectacular looping by some\npaddlers.\nThe next river attempted was by far the\nmost difficult encountered by the club. The\nUbaye was only attempted by the most\nexperienced paddlers, but even so, two\ncanoes were lost in a very short distance.\nTelevision Licences\nThe question as to whether or not you need\nto buy your own television licence if your\nparents have already got one seems to be\nshrouded in confusion. This confusion is\nentirely due to the totally incomprehensible\ngobbledegook printed on the application\nform.\nWhat the form is getting at is, that you DO\nneed a licence for all sets used other than in\nyour parents home except those which are\npowered by one or more batteries contained\nwithin the set. So unless your set is battery\npowered you need a licence.\nAfter this and other difficulties, the club was\nforced to abandon this river.\nThe club then crossed to the Massif\nCentral, where a day and a half Was spent\nrelaxing on the banks of the much quieter\nArdeche.\nThe club then travelled north to the Allier.\nThis river was paddled from Monistrol to\nLange ac. The river was rather a disappointment, as there was very little water\nflowing, but would have great potential as\nthere obviously had been earlier in the year.\nThis only left the two days travel back to\nLondon.\nFlat Agency Rip-Off\nIn the course of the mad scramble to find\nsomewhere to live, you may have paid money\nto flat agencies.\nIf they didn't find you anywhere to live, then\nyou should be entitled to your money back.\nUnder the Accommodation Agencies Act\n1953, a flat agency commits a criminal\noffence if it takes your money without giving\nyou somewhere to live in return. If you would like more information on this\n(or anything else for that matter), you can\nalways come up to the welfare centre, which\nis situated on the third floor of the Union\nBuilding and is open from 10:00am until\n5:30pm every weekday.\nCanoe club must give special thanks to Bill\nScurry, who did all the organizing for the trip.\nNow, looking towards the future, canoe\nclub is open to anyone in college with an\ninterest in canoeing, regardless of ability. The\nclub meets regularly at the swimming pool\nevery Tuesday evening (6:30-8:00) and in\nStan's Bar at 8:30. The trips for this term have\nbeen planned for the weekends of 10 and 11\nNovember to the River Wye and 24 and 25\nNovember to the River Usk. It is also hoped to\norganize a surfing trip to Bude near the end of\nterm.\nMET. ENV.\nSOC.\nthe not strictly\nrelevant, but usually\ntopical club\nNo subscriptions! Free admission to\nmeetings! Free coffee and biscuits at every\nmeeting! Non-technical talks about anything\nslightly relevant to environment and atmosphere - weather forecasters, experts on\nplanetary atmospheres, people to answer\nquestions on( government) energy policy....and many other topics! Cheese and\nwine parties!\nPeople from all departments are welcome\nto our first meeting, which is being held on\nMonday, 22nd October with probably ten to\nfifteen meetings this year. Come along to\nanything that interests you.\nMore information and applications for\nmembership cards are available from R Brugge (Atmos Phys PG) or R Graham\n(Phys UG) via letter racks.\nWELFARE\nMICHAEL ARTHUR\nWELFARE ADVISER\n12\n\n"

While, the 2nds played an aggressive\nmatch, where a player was taken to hospital\nwith two gashes in his head and a QM C player\ndislocated his knee. ,\nIC had two successful football matches,\nwhen the 4th s won 4-3 and the 2nds beat\nQMC 5-1. Sadly the 3rd lost to Royal\nHolloway 2nds after a disputed j penalty. The\n5th s and 6th s also lost in their matches wi Wi Charing Cross.\nBoth RSM rugby Ist and 2nd teams won their'\nmatches. The scores were 25-8 and 21-6\nrespectively.\nGutterage Cup\nWestfield College and the Royal Dental\nHospital were to have met on Wednesday to\ndecide a preliminary round in the Gutterage\nCup.

Bob Mills scored a fine goal from a perfectly weighted thirty yard\npass by Bob Dhillon, flicked on by Paul\nGalvin.\nPride of place must go to Andy Hartland\nwho score five times showing excellent\nfinishing abilities. The defence controlled\nLSE's attack well, with Neil Redmagre playing\nanother fine game at centre back. Steve Sims\nkept the midfield tidy, turning in his usual\nhighly reliable performance.

Copyright FELIX 1979\nCross Country Club\nAfter a promising intake of budding\nathletes at the fresher s' fair, the crosscountry club has made an excellent start, to\nwhat could be a very successful season.\nThe first race on our calender was the\nLondon University Trials, held at Parliament\nHill on Saturday, 7th October. Evan\nCameron, won the race easily, whilst Steve\nKirk showed good form in being fourth home\nfor UL, thus helping them to defeat a Blackheath Harriers team.\nThe following Saturday, we returned to\nParliament Hill for the University College\nRelay. Although the standard of the relay was\nlower than in previous years, several IC\nrunners put up good performances, and\nhelped the 'A' and 'B' teams to finish third and\nfifth respectively. The 'A' team, \"who were\nleading at the half-way stage, won medals for\ntheir position.\nICRFC 1ST XV 29\nD DIVISION 10\nThe rugby season started off for ICRFC 1st XV with an away fixture against D division,\nMetropolitan Police.\nThe weather was not conducive to fast,\nopen rugby, but IC eventually achieved a comfortable win. 'Edwina' Budgen scored a personal tally of 21 points and this included\ntwo tries and two drop goals. His first try\ncame from a clever piece of play between Raym\nParkinson and himself in the first half. He\nthen added to the score with a drop goal after\nRay (Old Man) Parkinson himself had scored.\nWith the score standing at 16-0 at half-time\nIC should have run out as easy winner, but\nthey allowed the police to come back into\nthey allowed the police to come back into the\ngame and they promptly scored two tries.\nHowever IC replied with two opportunist\ntries, with the second being a good individual\ntry from John Chandler. With the final score\nresting at 29-10, both sides were pleased to\nhear the final whistle and everybody\nadjourned to the bar.\nIt was pleasing to see the new players in the\nteam fitting in well and k the season promises\nto be a successful one for IC Rugby.\nICRFC 1ST XV 19\nHAYES 6\nThe weather again played a part in the\nmatch on Saturday, when ICRFC 1st XV\nentertained Hayes.\nThe newly purchased match ball was\nlikened to a 'lump of soap' and poor handling\nfrom both sides turned the game into a very\nscrappy affair.\nNevertheless the IC three-quarters looked\ndangerous when they received good ball.\nConsequently, in the first half both Ray\nParkinson and Pat Dunleavy scored well-worked tries.\nHalfway through the second half a forceful\nrun from Ray Parkinson led to a try from newcomer James Austin. Eddy Budgen then\nconverted it to a goal.\nHayes were allowed to score a breakaway\ntry and eventually full-time was blown. It was\ngenerally agreed that this match should be\nforgotten quickly.\nRobin Davies\nTABLE TENNIS The.match which everyone (?) had been\nwaiting for since the seconds were promoted\nto division four last season, took place last\nThursday evening - the 1st team vs the 2nds!( fanfare, exultant trumpeting amidst a cacophony of applause....fade to match\nreport).\nThe opening match, Pete (I'm a stoat!)\nRutherford against Farzin (Ayatollah)\nSobhanpanah, managed to warm up the ball,\nbut not the small off-putting group of IC\nplayers/spectators. Pete won.\nThere then followed a display of fine hitting\nand driving from Lakhani and Etheridge, the\nmatch being closer than the straight game\nresult suggested. Lakhani won for the firsts,\nmaking the match score 2-0.\nIn the third match, Kumar Singarajah (ex-ist team captain) and Andy Tye (present 2nd team captain) slotted neatly into their\nrespective roles as loo per and blocker, the\nformer winning by two sets to love. When not\naccusing the author of racist comments,\n'Stingy' produced occasional glimpses of his\ntrue genius (which was as much as he's ever\ndone).\nIn the fourth match, Rutherford, despite\ndisplaying a total lack of smashing ability,\nnevertheless produced play bordering on the\nuncanny, when hitting the edge of the table\nalmost at will, enabling himself to win in\nstraight games against Etheridge.\nThe fifth match, Kumar vs Farzin - one word\n- fast! Singalongarajah won in k three games.\nMatch six was Captain Lakhani vs Captain\nTye. Andy won making the score 5-1, and\nKartik didn't swear once - not even in Greek!\nKumar reacted much the same as Lakhani,\nin the previous match, to the fact that the\nfirsts had already won the tie, and lost easily\nto Ga\nPete then lost to Andy and it was 5-3, with\nthe 2nds playing for a point, but the final\nmatch saw Farzin against Kartik, who, at last\nshowing his form as IC's no. 1 player, proved\ntoo good on that day for our amiable Iranian\nTreasurer (hey, you're being complimented\nFarzin, perhaps your prospective girlfriend\nwill see this!) and the final result was a63 wm\nfor the first team.\nThe result was the second win for the first\nteam and the second defeat for the second\nteam (both teams played only two matches).\nOnly one other match last week as the 4th team's opponents failed to appear - at their\nown clubhouse!\nThe 3rds ate Sainsbury's3 for breakfast,\nthe 8-1 score line being a poor reflection on\nthe merits of their dominant defence and\nrampant attack....by Zeus, an end to this\"\ndrivel!\nHewkules\nWe are arranging friendly mixed matches\nagainst other colleges - we have some ladles\nwilling to play, but there is room for more. See\nus any Wednesday afternoon in the TT Room\nor most evenings. The first match is verses\nQM C details not available yet.\nThe Heap\n\n"

Now to what's going to happen.\nSaturday 20th, is the annual Silly Sports\noutside Harrods, where Guilds have a bit of\nfun collecting money for rag and indulging in\nsome light amusement, such as three or more\nlegged, wheelbarrow, piggy bank and camel\nraces and anything else Nab thinks of. Be at\nthe Guilds office at 9:30am to collect your bits\nand pieces and then off to wake Southside\nwith a boo malak a. Freshers' dinners; as you read this I will be\nrecovering from my own departments,\nhowever there is still CCD on 29th October\nand Mech Eng on 1st November, so hurry up\nand buy your tickets.\nHave fun!\nBryan\nGuilds' Publicity Officer\nROYAL\nSCHOOL\nOF MINES\nThe term drags on and so did last week's article, so this Is going to be a quickie.\nTwo fresher s' dinners have been and gone;\nthe Ladles' and Geology. All those who went\nto the Ladles' Dinner thoroughly enjoyed\nthemselves, but the Geology Dinner could\nhave been better supported. This leaves two\ndinners, which are:-FRI 19 OCT - MET & MAT SCI\nFRI 26 OCT - MIN RES ENG\nWe meet In the Union Bar before going up\nfor the actual dinner at 7:30pm. Afterwards,\nthere Is a yard-drinking contest and at closing\ntime, we all adjourn upstairs for a couple of\nbeers and unusual games. Please bring a change of clothing and stay for the after-dinner activities, if only to see your friends\nmake arse s of themselves.\nAt the election UGM yesterday, the\ncandidates for President, Vice President and\nHon Sec were unopposed and should have\nbeen ratified. The posts are filled by Bernie\nPryor, Simon Cocker and Trev Fletcher\nrespectively.\nDates for your diary, back of envelope or\nempty fag packet:-25 Oct - Commemoration Day\n31 Oct - Joint C CU Halloween Party In JCR\n4 Nov - the Nottingham 6s and 7s have been\npostponed.\n9 Nov - Aussie Bamight in Union Bar\n10 Nov - Lord Mayor's Procession (In which\nwe have a float)\n14 Dec - Mines Ball. Tickets will be on sale\nduring the coming week.\nFirstly, let me say that a great time was had\nby everyone who went to the Chemistry\nDinner. The quality of the after-dinner\nspeaking was quite magnificent, in fact,\nmaterial provided by one of the speakers may\nbe used at the Smoking Concert. So, if you\nmissed that one, you'd better buy a ticket for\none of the other three. Once again the dates\nare:\nMaths tonight\nPhysics on 26th October\nLife Sciences on 2nd November\nThe Rag Mag selling trips would have been\na rip-roaring success had Sussex University\nnot decided to ban the whole concept of Rag.\nEven so, we managed to sell about two\nhundred and fifty before the Sussex Union\nrounded us up. There will be no more trips\nuntil further notice due to minor technicalities preventing the sale of our\npublication.\nThe in aug ral meeting of the Rag Float\nBuilding Rabble was unable to start building\nthe Rag float due to an acute lack of building\nmaterials (i.e. cardboard). If you have any\nspare boxes lying around doing nothing in\nparticular, please bring them to the RCS Union Office as soon as possible. There will be a four-legged race down\nOxford Street tomorrow for Rag. Be in the\nR CSU at 9:30, if you want to make a fool of\nyourself for charity.\nYet another plea for help, in the way of\narticles, Gestetnering, or just coffee-making,\nfor this coming edition of that well-known\npublication 'Broadsheet', this Wednesday\nafternoon.\n\n"

    "content": "FILM REVIEW\n\"BREAKING AWAY\"\nReading through the production notes of\n\"Breaking Away\" before seeing the screening\nof this, 20th Century Fox's latest offering, I noted with interest the return of Peter Yates,\nwho after his smashing success with the film,\n\"The Deep\", ends up directing \"Breaking-Away\". Now you may think that \"The Deep\"\nwas not smashing, and who am I to argue?\nHowever, if 20th Century Fox think they are\non to a winner with this film, they are living in\na fantasy world.\nIt's another contemporary comedy about a set of four break-away students and their\ncapers during their first year outside high\nschool. For one reason or another they have\nnot taken the opportunity to go to Indiana\nUniversity, but instead are content to go\nswimming in a disused and flooded quarry,\nand generally drive round town in a careless\nfashion. The main star and subject of the plot\nis blond and innocent-looking Dave, played\nby Dennis Christopher. His ambition is to be\nan Italian bike racing champion and so he\nbuys an Italian phrase book and drives his\n'papa' and 'mama' up the wall. These antics\nare carried further, to climax in a very funny\nscene, as the father (quite a key figure in the\nplot) and well acted by Paul Doodey, finds\nDave shaving his legs in the bathroom!\nTrue story book fashion, he ends up\nchasing after the good-looking Katherine\n(played by Robyn Douglas) with a textbook\nshe has dropped off her scooter. He chats her\nup, not in the conventional Indiana student\ndrawl, but in a heavy Italian accent. She thinks he is Italian and in an ex cr uti a tingly funny scene of his later ser an a de to her\noutside the halls of residence convinces her\nhe must be a mad boy from 'Napoli'.\nGirls will be girls, and a jealous friend (with\nfriends like that who needs enemies?) rings\nup her steady boyfriend and he arrives in the\nMercedes to proceed to beat up Cyril, the\nguitar accompany ment. Revenge ensues in\nthe students union next day, as Cyril gets his\nfingers stuck in a bowling ball (where isn't there a student union without it's own bowling alley?) and strikes with good effect\nto skit tle out the opposition just before the\ncops arrive.\nThe result? A good all-American cycle race\nto show who is boss - our likeable tear a ways or the king pins from college. Drama builds,\nthe thousands of supporters cheer, and the\nfilm reviewer falls asleep, only to awaken to\nthe start of the 'Little 500' and the competing\nthirty-three teams attempts for glory. Of\ncourse Yates, famous for his direction of the\nexcellent car chase footage in Steve\nMcQueen's film \"Bullitt\" does a good job and\nsome of the incidents in the race are\nexcellently staged managed.\nI 'll leave you to see the film and thus the\nresult of the race. But like all bland American\n'A' certificate films, a moral must at least he\nattempted, and good old Dave starts college\nthe next session, and loses his Italian accent-well the bottom has dropped out of the ice\ncream business anyway - to chat up more\ncharming girls, this time in conventional\ntones.\n\"Breaking Away\" then is to'be released in\nlate November and is an amusing and likeable\nfilm to take granny to see on a wet\nWednesday afternoon, I'd count on the film to\nsink without trace, and if it doesn't then the\nBritish cinema goer loses all street credibility\nand 20th Century Fox slyly laugh all the way\nto the bank. Four out of ten to Peter Yates,\nand I'm off to see the \"Life of Brian\".\nHarvey Nadin\nALIEN THE\nBOOK\nWould you like to imagine at as c in a ting little alien delicately decapitating you? Far be\nit from me to encourage such dreams/nightmares/fantasies/fetishes, but\nhere is a review of 'Alien - the Book' anyway.\nThe 'novel iz ation' is by Alan Dean Foster\n(who?). Dan O 'Bannon wrote the screenplay;\nhe also wrote part of the screenplay for John Cap enter's hilarious' Dark Star'. The story? Oh yes - I won't recount it as\nyou've probably heard it at least once by now.\nIt gets off to a slow and pretentious start, but\nonce you have waded through a few chapters,\nthe pace warms up quite nicely. Various\ndisturbing events serve to keep your nerves\non edge as the alien gets into the spaceship\nand proceeds to make itself at home with\namazing efficiency.\nI was pleasantly surprised by the efficiency\nof the novel itself - one might expect that a horror thriller such as this would lose a lot of\nits effect without stunning visual impact, but\neven the words are quite effective.\nThe 'alternative reality' of the ship's interior\nis generally convincing, and the characters -even that of the alien - are realistic too. I resented the intrusion of the ship's cat - I had\nhorrible visions of the sentimental slush\nwhich dragged down 'Battlestar Galactica'but even the cat, has its role in the tale.\nUnfortunatley, the ending is a little c ii ched you get the feeling of 'Hell, how do you stop\nthis novel?' - but this doesn't detract unduly\nfrom a very good modern thriller, which I certainly recommend.\nOn the Picadilly line, 626 commuters can\nhear you scream....\nKen Strachan\n15\n\n"

    "content": "Dear Sir,\nThe presidents of the CC Us were\nquite correct in their assumption\nthat fresher s will have formed\ntheir own opinions of the CC Us,I am a fresher and I have.\nI sat through the absurdity of the\nR CSU meeting on Oct 1st, observing antics more often seen\nin second-rate comedy shows,\nculminating in a mock trial which\ntook place because the president\nwas not wearing the presidential\nunderwear! The occasion seemed\nnot to be democratic, but chaotic,\na platform from which any ham-actor can boost an elephantine\nego to Olympian heights. More\nseriously, we were asked to vote\nrepresentatives into union posts,\nwhich were ill-defined, without\nknowing anything about the\ncandidates, which is surely\nagainst the spirit of democracy.\nAnother point the presidents\nraised, was that all the first week's activities were well attended,\nwhich was true, since they were a new phenomena to many fresher s. Yet to me, there seemed\nto be a credibility gap between the\nincoherent inebriates I saw at the\nR CSU bar night and supposedly\nresponsible union officials. The\nentire evening was devoted to the\nbelief that to drink to excess and\nmouth obscenities is the pin a cle of joy, which the R CSU officials\nmust believe, since they arrange\neverything.\nThe many good points the.\npresidents did mention can easily\nbe tackled by a reformed body\nand so cannot be an argument in\ntheir defence.\nBut my most basic criticism is\nthat the system forms a self-perpetuating clique, while many\nof Britian' s quaint little anachronisms, glorious at a distance, but when viewed closely\nreveals its decadence and decay.\nIt is time this 'spoilt infant' was\nbrought kicking and screaming\ninto the economic and social\nrealities of 1979.\nYours sincerely,\nSD Goulder\nDear Sir,\nDuring Tuesday's UG M,I was\namazed to find that despite heated\ndiscussion on two controversial\nnotions, the only breach of the\npeace was committed by our\nPresident, Chris Fox. Mr Fox flew\ninto a tantrum at the sight of some\nunion members leaving before the\ndebate on occupation and let\nforth a tirade of incoherent abuse\nand foul language. His anger and\nfrustration were understandable,\nbut his behaviour was disgusting\nand reprehensible.\nYours sincerely,\nL. Hunt\nDear Editor,\nWandering down Queen's Gate\nTerrace (you know, the road\nbetween mathematics and the\nQueen's),I noticed a sign tied to a parking meter which said: \"People\ndumping rubbish here are liable to\npersecution.\" Is this a new word\nfor 'attention by the law'?\nLG Kirby\nSir,\nThe letters from Michael O 'Connor and Frank James got\nstuck on my shit filter as I read\nFELIX last week, so I felt I had to\nreply to them.\nMr O' Connor's \"intelligent,\nresponsible and socially aware\nbehaviour\" already occurs, or is\nsupposed to, within ICU. ICU\nUG Ms are also incredibly boring,\nbut fortunately, attendance is\noptional. You don't have to go to\nC CU UG Ms either.\nI would consider anybody to be\nlacking in \"social development\" if\nthey were unable to let their hair\ndown in some way. Guilds people\nhave plenty of work to do, and\nbetween lectures, tutorials, labs\nand so on,.many like to relax in\nan energetic fashion. Nobody has\nto go to a Guilds U GM, but people\ndo, throughout the year, and I for\none don't feel in the least\ndegraded. (I don't go to Morphy\nday.) You say that this kind of\nbehaviour must sour the public\nagainst students; surely it is better\nfor us to play in Mech Eng220 than at home or in the street,\nwhere the public can in fact SEE us?\nThe CC Us AREa \"centre for\norganizing action\", some of it on\nacademic affairs, fresher s' dinners, etc., but an awful lot on\nRag. If you have any doubts about\nthe beneficial effect on Rag of\ninternecine C CU rivalry, consider\ntwo matters:\n1. The amount of extra money\noften collected just to beat\nanother CC U's total.\n2. As a commercial parallel, the\nsteamroller success of General\nMotors' various competing divisions.\nAs for the strange game played\nwith coins: I thought it a bit odd\ntoo. But can you honestly carp\nabout the waste of time? Have you\nnever sat in front of a television\nwhen you didn't have to, or had\nfive minutes' extra morning\nsnooze for the hell of it?\nMr James: you strike me as a puritan, a bore or both. Did you\nreally think that your abolition\nwas suggested seriously? Your\ntotal lack of humour demonstrates how pathetic these ICU\npeople are....\nI think that you are doing more to\nenforce conformity than any\nnumber of beer-swilling latent\nhomosexuals (personally, I prefer\nScotch, beautiful cars and fast\nwomen). ACC U is an expression\nof individuality and enterprise\n(not to mention insanity) to which\nit's great to feel you belong (to\n'borrow' a slogan). Before coming\nup to IC, I experienced a broad\nrange of social situations, from\ndiscussions on nuclear energy at\n2am to learning to dance (while\ninebriated) at a rockabilly concert. When I came here, I chose Guilds as my social\nmedium - all by myself. It did\ninvolve thought; it did not involve\ncoercion.\nYou suggest that CC Us should\nexist solely for sports and\nacademic affairs. Surely this\nwould make them automatically\nsuperfluous, as sports have their\nown hierarchy, and academic\naffairs already have ICU committees. Megalomania is alive\nand well and living in South\nKensington!\nYour postscript seems to betray\na somewhat smug and childish\nattitude: somewhat anti intellectual, I would say. This has been rather a long letter,\nbut my blood boils no longer. You\nmay note that I can write words of\nmore than one syllable, and that I consider\" above average intelligence\" to be an insulting\nunderstatement for a number of\npeople at IC.\nYours faithfully,\nKenneth R Strachan\nDear Sir,\nLast term I voted for Chris Fox\nbecause he campaigned for a balanced Union. Yet in his\nsupport for the occupation he has\nshown a complete lack of balance.\nHe has failed to balance idealism\nand realism. He has failed to\nbalance ideals with what the\ncountry can afford. He has failed\nto balance aspirations with what\ncan be ache i ved. He has failed to\nbalance the authority of the\nNational Government elected by a huge majority with the close result\nof the last UGM and his lack of\noverwhelming support, (the first\ncount, on the 3rd amendment,\nbefore 2 . 3 0 pm., showed a difference of less than 15 with\nmore than 400 votes cast). He\nexpects the Government to\nreverse their policies when\nCabinet Ministers spent most of\nlast week saying that they would\nnever do such a thing.\nBy failing to balance the\ndisadvantages of an antagonistic\ndestructive approach with the\nadvantages of adopting a constructive attitude, and by\nputting his politics before the\ninterests of those who elected him\nhe has shown that he himself has\nfound it easy to do aU turn.\nIndeed, our President, has\nbecome totally unbalanced.\nYours sincerely,\nRichard Wormsley (Maths II)\nDEBATING\nSOCIETY\nThe Debating Society held its fresher s' debate on Thurday, 11th October, tt was\ndecided that it should take the form of a balloon debate. Each speaker was to speak\nfor three minutes on his chosen character,\nexplaining why he should not be ejected from\nthe imaginary sinking balloon.\nFirst was Nick Ajderian, who spoke as\nhimself, a tolerance engineer. Next Richard\nKicks spoke as Tony Benn, explaining that he\nbelieved in free speech, as long as you agreed\nwith him. Adrian Black also spoke as himself,\nexplaining that he was the lightest. Next was\nMark Jeffcock, who spoke as Eugene\nFerdinad, commander of Apollo 17, the last\nman on the moon. Then Jonathan Briggs,\ndoing an excellent 'kiss y kiss y' spoke as Miss\nPiggy. There followed John Murphy as a pregnant Elkie Brooks. Tom Owen spoke as\nMartin Luther King, claiming he should be\nsaved in order to be assassinated. Philip\nGreenstreet claimed to be that great Victorian\nsocial reformer, Jack the Ripper, Finally, Ken\nMann spoke as Doctor Cri pp in. Questions and comments then came from\nthe floor, such as the morbid observation that\na pre gn an at Elkie Brooks could not stay\naboard the balloon since, strictly speaking\nthe rules only allowed one person to remain.\nFinally a vote was taken, and Ken Mann was\nthe winner, thus becoming eligible to drink\nfrom the fresher s debating pot in the Union\nBar.\nIf anyone out there would like to attend\ndebates or help with the society generally,\nscour FELIX for our notices and look for our\nposters.\nCOMMUNITY\nACTION\nGROUP\nTASK FORCE\nThere are over 10,000 old people living\nalone in Kensington, many of whom never go\nout and have very few visitors. Some of them\ndo not claim (or even know about) the\nbenefits that they are entitled to, such as\n'meals on wheels' and home helps and others\nregard these as 'taking charity' and would\nrather starve to death. They may be\npersuaded to stay alive if their life was made\nworth living. Volunteers are needed to visit\nthem regularly, to talk to them, to take them\nfor walks {in a wheelchair if necessary), and\nto make sure that they are claiming enough to\nlive on.\nThere are some pensioners who are being\nturned into vegetables by the institutional\nattitudes and staff shortages in some old\npeople's homes. Some are literally dying of\nboredom and others are going senile. This\ncould be prevented by volunteers visiting\nthem, and keeping the old people alive\n(mentally at least). Those who have always\nled full and active lives can not stand the\nthought that they are now useless, and lose\nthe will to live when they start losing their\nfaculties.\nIf you would like to help these people,\nplease contact:\nJohn Whitehouse (ICU office or ICCAG\nroom),\nSurila Nimalasuriya (Maths 2)\nSimon Chandler (Red Cross Members'Group\nleader, Maths) or anyone wearing an ICCAG\nbadge.\nWe also do work with more active\npensioners such as taking dogs for walks,\ntaking people to the seaside (in the summer),\ndigging gardens for people who can manage\nall right otherwise, etc. ICCAG alos works\nwith young people, children, anyone else in\nneed - tell us if you know of anyone. Come to\nour room at the top of the Union Building any\nlunchtime and John Whitehouse will give you\na cup of coffee.\nSoup runs as usual - Tuesday and Friday at\n10:30pm. in Falmouth Hall kitchen\nFiona Sinclair (Maths 2)\n4\n\n"

It is URGENT that there is a large\nturnout. PLEASE ATTEND!\nOCCUPATION\nLast Tuesday's U GM decided, by the narrowest of majorities, to begin an occupation of the Senior Dining Room( on level 2 S her field Building). The occupation is in protest to the Government's policies\nand aims in Education, in particular their attitude towards overseas students and their avowed intention to charge the\n'full economic cost' ( probably about^2500) to such students.\nBecause the action is aimed at the Government and intended to elicit a response from the student movement and the media, the SDR was chosen, a site which does not disrupt college administration, which is basically sympathetic, or academic teaching. The occupation is planned to continue through the weekend and into next week. By Wednesday the Union had managed to organise an efficient shift system which left about50 students in occupation throughout the day and night.\nVarious recreational activities, including table tennis, bridge and listening to classical music, all help to occupy the time of the students in the SDR. The Guardian mentioned the occupation in its Wednesday Edition and there has been a lukewarm response from the\nBBC.( they briefly mentioned us on a radio news broadcast).\nA letter explaining ICU's position was delivered to 10\nDowning Street, on Thursday afternoon, by RogerS totes bury, and the chairman of the ACC, Suki Kali rai.

Letters\nare to be sent out to all current\nholders of union-allocated rooms,\nasking them to justify why their\nsuccessors should have a place in\nhall.

The book is based on the\nseries, which was first broadcast in March\n1978 and has since had two repeats. It covers\nthe first four episodes, but with minor\ndifferences throughout - the plot diverging\nsignificantly at the end.\nFor non-initiates into such mysteries as\nPan Galactic Gargle Blasters and the\nRavenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal, the story\nstarts at the West Country home of Arthur\nDent (a local radio employee), which is just\nabout to be demolished to make way for a by-pass. When the earth is subsequently\ndestroyed by the Vogons to make way for a new hyperspace by-pass Arthur and his\nfriend Ford Prefect, who turns out to be from\na small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse\nand not from Guildford after all. hitch a lift\nwith the Vogons' cooks. The book follows the\nhighly improbable events ofthe next few days\nin the course of which Arthus and Ford are\nrescued from certain death by an\nexperiment?! ship with the new Infinite\nImprobability Drive, crewed by Zaphod\nBeeblebrox - the three-armed, two-headed,\nrenegade Galactic President, Trilliam - a girl\nArthur once completely failed to get off with\nat a party in Islington, and the intensively\ndepressive and (depressing) robot Marvinnicknamed by the humans 'the Paranoid\nAndroid'. The next day they reach the\nlegendary Magrathea, home of luxury planet\nbuilders and, after escaping certain death,\nmeet Slartibartfast, who gives them some\nimportant information concerning earth\nhistory. The story continues and before long\nthey are facing certain death again. At this\npoint the book differs from the radio series\nand they are not blasted through time to the\nRestaurant at the End of the Universe. To find\nout what happens you will have to buy the\nbook\nThe book is highly enjoyable throughout,\nthis being in no small part due to the frequent\ninclusion of passages from the electronic\nbook, \"The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy'\nfor which Ford is a field researcher, and\nwhich, as he says, tells you everything you\nneed to know about everything from towel to\nGod to small furry creatures from Alpha\nCentauri. The book retains the ironical\nhumour of the series with equal success\nalthough, on the whole, I preferred it on the\nradio. Even so the book is definitely worth\ngoing*without two pints for tonight, so you\ncan afford it.\nTJ Tuggey\n14\n\n"

    "content": "U GM REPORT U GM16 TH OCTOBER One thing about Imperial College Union\nmeetings is that you can't accuse them of\nbeing to taU y predictable. The one on\nTuesday was managing quite nicely (at being\npredictable that is) until a rather interesting\nsting in the tail, but more on that later.\nAt the start of the meeting the crowd had\nmainly amassed to ensure that no undue\ncriticism of apartheid was made (after all it is\nmany miners bread and butter). But during\nthe debate on sporting links with South\nAfrica, the miners did make their true concern\nfelt for the oppression of blacks and\ncoloured s in S A by shouting \" Ah\" whenever it\nwas referred to. Despite this, the final result\nwas deleting all union policy on South Africa.\nThe policy now reads that South Africa is a place of equal merit to work or play rugby in\nas anywhere else (except perhaps it's sunnier!).\nThe next motion discussed, concerned the\n'sick and blatantly racist' Rag Mag. After\nrevealing that once stamped with the name of\nthe printers the mags were in fact legal, the\nmeeting decided that raising money for\ncharity was more important than either the\nimage of Imperial College or the risk of\noffending the disabled people that the cash is\nfor. So the Rag Mag will be sold!\nThe most humorous part of the discussion\noccurred after a heckler sited the Irish putting\nbombs under people's cars as justifying Irish\nracism. The speaker on the floor replied,\n\"Why then always make them out to be\nstupid? After all it's pretty clever to put bombs\nunder some people's cars!\"\nThe motion on education cuts and\noccupation having been moved forward on\nthe agenda, two amendments were debated.\nThe first suggested occupying the House of\nCommons in preference to the college. Sean\nO 'Boyle knocked that one on the head as he\nhighlighted how difficult it is to penetrate into\nthe House of Commons. He once had his rag\ncan taken off him as an illegal weapon when\nattempting to enter!\nThe Conservative Association received a rough ride from the crowd when they moved\nthe second amendment. However, Mark\nClegg, magnanimous as ever, admitted that\noverseas students make some contribution to\neducation in Britain. In the end a wonderful\nexample of leadership by the executive\nencouraged the remaining four hundred\npeople at just gone 2:30pm to vote in favour of\nthe motion, un amended. And off they rushed\nto occupy the staff dining room!\nWell at least it ensured that the only\ndisruption is to the cockroaches!\nCOMMEMORATION DAY\nThere will be a College half-holiday for\nstudents on the afternoon of Thursday, 25th October, so that they may take part in the\nCommemoration Day celebration.\nALL LECTURES WILL CEASE AT 12:30.\nSNOOKER CLUB\nThis year's fresher s' tournament was won\nby the number one seed, Chris Tripp (Maths\n1). He defeated the number two seed, Shaun\nArmstrong (Metallurgy 1) in the final. In fact,\nhe did not lose a single frame during the\nwhole tournament, and made several breaks\nover twenty. I would like to thank everybody\nwho took part, especially Dave Simmonds\nwho sat patiently for five hours to play his first\nframe, which was, unfortunately for him,\nagainst Tripp. I would also like to thank Steve\nJeans, Alan Leclezio and Tom McClelland for\nall their help.\nThe next competition is tomorrow. It is the\npot-luck doubles' tournament. In this\ncompetition, doubles pairs will be drawn at\nrandom, so if you do not have a partner, it\ndoes not matter. Anybody wishing to take\npart should be in the snooker lounge by\n10:30am. Entrance fee is 25p members, 50p non-members.\nI am contemplating a snooker club outing\nto Preston to see the UK professional\nchampionship. This would take place at the\nend of November, I would be grateful if any of\nyou who would like to go on this trip would let\nme know by Wednesday, 24th October. I am\nin the snooker lounge every lunchtime.\nFinally, a reminder that our first lessons will\nbe on Monday at 5:30.\nRastus Adolf Napoleon Odinga Odinga\n(Prez)\nBRIBES\nPROBE It has now been revealed that.earlier this\nweek, four members of IC's 'elite' 4th hockey\nsquad were accosted by a man acting on\nbehalf of a Surrey hockey club. This man,\nobviously an expert, spotted the talent latent\nIn these four players and immediately Invited\nthem to join the club. Among Inducements\nput forward were free beer, free transport and\nthe promise of plenty of girls. In addition, the\nagent attempted to buy the foursome a pint of\nREAL ale (I) and offered free transport to an\nevening of \"....free booze and women.\" No\nfees were discussed for the players, but they\nwere told that the agent would contact them\nand would (quote) \"....make It worth your (the\nplayers) while to play for this club.\"(Nudge,\nnudge, say no more.)\nOne disturbing aspect of the affair was that\nthe agent seemed to feel that IC hockey\nplayers were all 'beer-swilling louts' and so\ncould be bought for free beer and women\n(not necessarily in that order). However, it Is expected that the players will\nturn down the move, mainly on financial\ngrounds - it costs 80p return to Wimbledon\nstation, where the transport is laid on.\nCYCLISTS\nmake it safe to leave a bike at\nCollege. Come to a meeting at\n1:00pm, Tuesday 23rd October, in\nthe Senior Dining Room and let's CATCH THE THIEVES!\nINTERESTED IN GOING ON AN EXPEDITION?\nImagine the scene. It's late March, a party\nof geologists are walking and squelching\nthrough the mud-flats of the Wash in pouring\ndriving rain. Thoughts turn away from the\nbiomass of a mussel bank to dwell on the\nthoughts of warmth and comfort, to ideas of\ndoing something more exciting than\ncounting sea-shells.\n\"How about....going to Oman?\" Guy suddenly asked me. I stopped contemplating\nthe pint of bitter I was going to murder that\nevening and decided to humour him. Another\none of his weird and wonderful ideas, I thought. \"Where?\"\n\"Oman. It's in Arabia - there's mountains\nthere and I'm told there are granites with\nsome fossils in them.\"\nOh well, Ithought, it seems more likely than\nour previous idea of studying earthquakes in\nOuter Mongolia.\nFrom these improbable beginnings some\nsemblance of an expedition has emerged.\nThere are eight of us at the moment all\ndedicated to getting out to Oman in\nautumn of next year and, believe it or not, this\nis not a glorified geologists' holiday. With the\nassistance of a few eminent geologists we\nhave raised this project to the status of a serious scientific expedition.\nNow, we have a problem, it is our intention\nto take two long wheel base four wheel drive\nland rovers overland to Omen, drive them\naround the mountains there and baring them\nback again. An estimated 10,000 miles. For\nthis we need a mechanic.\nSo, if you (or anybody you know) are\ninterested in going on an expedition from\nNovember 1980 to January 1981 and you are\na good experienced mechanic capable of\nmaintaining these vehicles please contact\neither Gary Nichols (Geology 3, Beit 129) or\nLADIES HOCKEY\nLast Wednesday, IC Ladies' Hockey team\nhad their first outing of the season. Resting\non their laurels from the seven-a side\ntournament success, the ladies were eagerly\nlooking forward to their first full length match\nof the season.\nIt took a while for both teams to settle into\nthe game and after a lot of disorganized play,\nRoyal Holloway found the back of the net.\nAs the match settled down, IC began to use\nthe field more with some nice through balls\nfrom Julia Towns, playing well at centre-half.\nThe defence played we|| together and the\nhalves were able to feed the forwards plenty\nof goods. Unfortunately, the finishing power\nupfront left a lot to be desired.\nHowever, IC drew level just before half-time, when Shirley Course took the ball up\nthe left wing and Carol Thomas picked up her\ncross to score, despite the close marking of\nthe Holloway defence.\nDuring the second half, both teams had\nplenty of chances to score, but it was Royal\nHolloway that made them count, and the final\nscore was 2-1 to the home team.\nThe IC team was: Julia Towns( Capt), Carol\nThomas, Shirley Course, Fay Hood, Hilary\nCarter, Karen Jones, Dana Clark, Caroline\nBrown, Catherine Crossley, Alex Burnip,\nand Averl Horton. Alison Oversby was the\numpire.\nHay Food!\n3\n\n"

    "content": "Fourteen month old Jerome lay in the hospital\ncot, almost lifeless, dressed only in a napkin with the\nfan playing on his hot little body. He'd been like that\nfor a couple of days - would the drugs work? We sat\nanxiously watching him for any sign of real life.\nHe'd caught meningitis and we had rushed tii m the twenty miles to Truro Hospital. \"We'll have to\nmake some tests to see what is causing the pain - it\ncould be meningitis. If it is, we need to know the\nvirus,\" the house doctor informed us.\nTests confirmed meningitis, and the next day the\nvirus was known too. We were told that the\ntreatment may have some side effects but the\nalternative - alternative? - was likely to be death.\nGradually he showed signs of life, but what we\nremember most were his eyes; dull, lifeless and\nunseeing, so unlike the sparkling eyes of our baby,\nbut even they came back to life again and soon he\nwas home again - almost as good as new, except\nthat he was deaf!\nWe didn't learn that he was deaf though for a few\nmonths, as he didn't learn to talk or respond to a call.\nAt four and three-quarters he went to a partially\nhearing unit in a school at Honiton, twenty-five\nmiles from our new home on the edge of Dartmoor,\nunable to hear properly and unable to speak. The\ndevoted attention from the staff of the partially\nhearing unit together ei th the NHS hearing aids\nworked wonders. Soon he was talking so that at\nleast we could understand him, even if strangers\ncouldn't until they became 'tuned-in' to his strange\nintonation.\nJerome and most of his eleven friends atthe PHU,\nalthough with differing degrees of deafness, were\nblessed with the ability to learn. So with sheer hard\nwork from the staff, not to mention from mums and\ndads coping with homework most nights, they have\nmaintained a high academic standard at the primary\nlevel, and probably more important, they can mix\nwithout embarrassment with children their own age.\nBut the deaf world is very demanding and Jerome\nbegan to become conscious of his body-worn\nhearing aids. He would cover them over in public, so\nthey couldn't be seen - and so cut down their ability\nto pick up sounds, indeed they picked up the sound\nof coats and pullovers rubbing together. The danger\nsigns of withdrawal into the deaf world were\nshowing.\nIt was at this stage that the phonic ear made its\npresence felt in Devon. One little girl's life was\nJEROME'S LIFE WAS\nTRANSFORMED BY\nLAST YEARS\nRCSU RAG\ntransformed by her ability suddenly to hear with the\naid of a phonic ear. This piece of gadgetry is a radio\nreceiver/hearing aid worn by the child, tuned into a radio transmitter worn by a teacher or whoever.\nTeacher can be up to a hundred yards away, while\nthose who are talking face to face with the aid-wearer can still be heard with the hearing aid part.\nThe key to its success is that it amplifies\nmagnificently, but will not amplify beyond a certain\nlevel, those frequencies that could harm any\nresidual hearing that may be.\nThe phonic ear seemed to be an answer to the\nproblem of teaching beyond primary school age. A willing teacher wearing a microphone could talk\nwhilst writing on the board and still be heard by the\ndeaf child. But at \u00a3750plus each, Devon Education\nAuthority couldn't see their way to buying them.\nOver a period of a year Rotary Lions and other\ngroups of generous local people provided the\nyoungsters with a phonic ear each, for school use.\nTheir rate of learning increased appreciably. While\nstrain on the teachers decreased. Outings were no\nlonger a nightmare for the staff and more were\narranged, even to London.\nThere was one major drawback however, the\nbuilt-in rechargeable batteries would last during the\nschool day, so in the evenings and over the\nweekends it was back to the good, but inferior,\nordinary body-worn aids - and the growing\nembarrassment with them.\nOne or two youngsters were even provided with\ntheir personal Phonic Ear for home use, and it was at\nthis time, in March 1979, that RCS stepped in and\nheld-up' and bus ke d their way to the \u00a3750 for\nJerome's phonic ear.\nWhat a difference that has made! From the\nelementary language he has been using he now has\nstarted speaking 'colloquially' (as the euphemism\nhas it). Mum can call him from another room without\nhaving to rush around and find him, while a device\nenables him to listen to the television without the\nrest of us being deafened. But the greatest\nadvantage is that he is no longer embarrassed by the\nreceiver on his chest - on the contrary he is proud of\nit! So now we have a more confident, happy boy and\nthe withdrawal has been reversed.\nOh yes, he has a speaking part, albeit small, in the\nlocal amateur dramatic society production of the\n'Caucasion Chalk Circle'. \"Be quiet will you, I'm learning my lines.\"\nOur thanks to IC.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nIN OCCUPATION\nAGAINST\nEDUCATION CUTS AND\nINCREASES IN OVERSEAS\nSTUDENTS FEES\nPLEASE JOIN US!\nSENIOR COMMON ROOM,\nSHERFIELD BUILDING\n1ST FLOOR\nALL students, academic and other staffs\nwelcome to join.\nSuki Kalirai\nACC Chairman\nPete Bamford\nRSMU Academic\nAffairs Officer\nDave Lyons\nPermanent\nWorking Party\nMalcolm Brain\nDeputy President\nJon Firth\nPub Board Chairman\nLiz Lindsay\nRCSU Academic\nAffairs Officer\nTansy Hepton\nRoger Stotesbury\nHon.
