    "content": "music reviews\nMmmmmmmmusic. Great. It's been fun,\nbut after 29 issues, (well, 28 really, after\nlast week's4 page spectacular) it's time\nto relinquish my automatic right to pocket any CD that finds its way into the Felix\noffice. I'm off to take over as manager of\nour fantastic student radio station, to\nwhich I'm sure you are already a regular\nlistener, and to do some general writing\nand editing stuff for this wonderful pub-li cation. I'm pleased to announce that\nSajini Wijetilleka is brave/stupid enough\nto be taking over from me next year.\nWithout my talented, dedicated team\nof reviewers, there would, I think, be two\npossibilities: either I would spend my\nentire life in the West basement of Beit\nQuad, slowly forgetting what natural\nlight really looks like, or there would simply be no music pages. So, thanks to the\nfollowing people for all their hard work in\nwriting reviews:\nPatrick, Alex, Jess, Sajini, Derek,\nOscar, Chris, Ben, Toby G, Libby,\nRobert, Tom X, Jamie, Francois, Tank,\nWarul, Robin, Toby B, Kunal, Marcus,\nNick, Koram, Tommy Mack, Tom B, Russ, Alexis, Jon, Jeannette, Tom R, Rob, Vic, Komal, Leyla, Bharat, Jo,\nJohnny, Dominic, Linus, Ken, Daniel,\nElena and, last but by no means least,\nRaoul Duke and Dr Gonzo.\nDave\nDJ SHADOW COMPETITION\nThanks to everyone who entered our\nrecent DJ Shadow competition.\nCongratulations to the following\npeople, each of whom wins an exclusive DJ Shadow mix CD:\nChris Bates (Maths II)\nRobin Clark (Medicine IV)\nHannah Johnson (Bio. Sci. PG)\nChris Pollock (Physics I) Becky Wilson (Bio. Sci. PG)\nLayo & Bushwacka\nNight Works\nOut Monday 1 July on XL recordings\nThese two first began working together\nin the mid-nineties, when drum 'n' bass\nwas taking over the hardcore scene and\nthe new tech-house and breakbeat styles\nwere emerging from the clubs. Both from\nLondon, they began to play together\nmore often and released an album on\nEnd recordings called Low Life.\nSince then, they've got bigger and big-ger, mixing together techno, electro and,\nin their words, \"proper tunes\". They have\neven been known to turn down the\nopportunity to play at a club unless\noffered a full five-hour set to showcase\ntheir talents.\nOn their second album Night Works,\nLayo and Bushwacka broaden their horizons with more diverse tunes and sam-ple s. It begins with an intro called Vinyl\nand then bursts into Ladies And\nGentlemen, a tune in a similar style to the\nmusic of DJ Shadow.\nThe album drifts on brilliantly to We\nMet Last Night, a chilling yet brilliant\nelectro tune, using brilliant samples and\na good bass line to make you stand up\nand listen. Sleepy Language, as the title\nsuggests, lulls you into a relaxed state of\nconsciousness with its fading electronic\nnoises.\nEventually, we reach their anthem\nLove Story, previously known as For The\nFans, which was renamed by their fans in\nArgentina who sit down rather than\ndance through the track as a mark of\nrespect for its majesty.\nThought of by some as the most eagerly anticipated dance album of the year,\nNight Works is definitely a must for those\ninto dance. Have it!\nGary Numan\nExposure\nOut now on Universal records\nWhilst most music stars have a fall from\ngrace taking in drink, drugs, \"artistic differences\" and perhaps even an untimely\ndeath, Gary Numan uniquely made an\nappearance on it's A Celebrity Knockout\nas part of his downward trajectory.\nBut that was the lowest point in his\ncareer, and it really is cruel of me to mention it. However, the release of Armand\nvan Helden's Koochy, The Sugababes'\nFreak Like Me and the Basement Jaxx's Where's your Head At?, all of which sampled his work, have helped bring Gary\nNuman back into the public conscious-ness.\nIf, for any reason, you place Numan in\nthe \"eighties relic\" bracket, then now\nwould be a good time to reshape your\nopinions. It is no secret that he has influenced artists as diverse as Afrika\nBambaataa, Marilyn Manson and a whole shipload of DJs. He is a pioneer of\nelectronic music. Whilst Kraftwerk may\nhave given synthesised sounds a brain, it\nwas Numan who gave them spirit.\nListening to tracks such as Are\n'Friends' Electric?, Cars and M.E., it's easy to see that a million and one bands\nhave pilfered samples from Numan's work. Through the album, we get to hear\nhow the infective electro-pop sound of\nCars has developed into his dark, atmospheric and brooding recent work, such as\nMy Jesus.\nUltimately, with this album, you get to\nbe a sightseer visiting Gary Numan's work - you check out the salient tracks\nwithout having to bother with the sur-rounding s. For the uninitiated, this is an\nideal introduction to his music.\nID Toby B Patrick\n\n"

    "content": "college news\nAccommodation Sought\nCollege officials are currently\ninvolved in negotiations that\ncould see external student\naccommodation being leased\nto Imperial to ensure it maintains its guarantee of hall\naccommodation for all fresher s and first-year postgraduates\nwhile Southside undergoes its\nplanned refurbishment.\nThe properties - sited on\nCromwell Road and Queens\nGate Gardens - are are owned\nby a neighbouring academic\ninstitution that may not\nrequire their use for a period of\nthree or four years, potentially\nfreeing them up for use by\nImperial students. As reported earlier this term, the\nCollege faces a potential crisis\nover a lack of student bed-spaces due to its plans to sell\nClayponds village in Ealing\nand that Southside halls are\ndue to close for a two-year\nrefurbishment project in the\nautumn of 2003.\nFelix understands that the\nhousing offered in these properties would be based on\naccommodation licenses of 51-weeks' duration, and so would\nbe most suitable for postgraduates. The College would then\nbe able to use its own properties to offer undergraduates\naccommodation for shorter\nlicense periods.\nUnion President, Sen\nGanesh, told Felix that the\nnegotiations were still at a very early stage, but the\nCollege is working hard to\nensure that it offered sufficient\nlevels of hall accommodation.\nMr. Ganesh went on to say\nthat he had been assured that\nthe guarantee of accommodation for first year undergraduate and postgraduate students would be met.\nFrancis Warned\nDavid Francis, Deputy\nPresident for Education and Welfare, was given a formal\nwritten warning at this year's last meeting of Union\nCouncil.\nUnion President, Sen\nGanesh, was obliged to issue\nthe warning to Mr. Francis\ndue to the alleged libellous\ncontent of a report that he\nhad submitted to Council in March. This followed a complaint by Mustafa Arif, the\npresident of City and Guilds\nCollege Union, and relates to\ncomments made by Mr.\nFrancis regarding the issue of\nthe electronic LE Q system,\nwhich many people allege\nMr. Arif tampered with.\nAlthough most senior\nUnion figures believe that\nthese allegations are true, Mr.\nArif has not formally been\nbrought before a College disciplinary committee to\nanswer these charges, and as\nsuch they remain unsubstantiated. A senior Union source said\nthat they thought that the\nwarning had \"been a long\ntime coming,\" and that\n\"David Francis has been a law unto himself for the\nwhole year, which is symptomatic of Sen Ganesh failing to\nlead the Union or manage the\nwork of his deputies.\" It is\nnot known whether this view\nis indicative of the views of\nCouncil as a whole, as there\nare other senior Union members who believe the complaint to be a waste of\nCouncil time and more about\npersonalities than the issues\nat hand.\nAlex\nMeanwhile, in another\ndevelopment, the Rector has\napologised over the way in which the news that\nClayponds village is to be sold\nnext year was released. The\ndecision to approve the proposed sale was made before\nconsulting the student body,\nand met with an angry\nresponse at a meeting of the\nUnion's Executive Committee\nlast month.\nMr. Ganesh told Felix that in\norder to improve communication between the College, the\nUnion and its students regarding matters of ac com moda tion, a monthly meeting\nbetween him, the Rector,\nDeputy Rector and the\nDirector of Estates would now\ntake place \"to ensure that students are kept aware of developments.\" John S Issue 1240\n19 June 2002\nEditor: will Dugdale\nDeputy Editor: Ali Wren\nNews & Sport: Alex Coby\n& John Stratford\nMusic: Dave Edwards\nBooks: Jon Matthews\nArts: Jon Brenner\nFilm: Darius Nikbin\nCrossword: Dr. Hot Fudge\nWith Thanks To:\nAnyone and Everyone\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince\nConsort Road, London,\nSW7 2BB Tel: 020 7594 8072\nEmail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nFelix is a registered\nnewspaper: ISSN 1040 - 0711\nCopyright \u00a9 Felix 2002\nPrinted by M CP Litho\nNATIONAL ASTHMA CAMPAIGN\nconquering asthma\nKnowledge of Reference Manager?\nSpare time in the holidays?\nWant to do something worthwhile?\nThe Research Team at the\nNational Asthma Campaign needs\nyou.\nLooking for an enthusiastic volunteer to\nhelp disseminate the research we fund.\nGain experience of working in the\ncharity sector.\nINTERESTED?

The\noriginal contractors hit financial difficulties in June 2000\nand went bankrupt later that\nyear. This helped to increase\nthe cost of the project from\n\u00a312.5m to almost \u00a317m.

Estates\nwas split into three separate\ndepartments; Property,\nMaintennance and Projects.\nThe Director of Estates, Ian\nCaldwell, was unceremoniously removed from day-to-day\ncontrol of his department and\nput in charge of the College's long term property development strategy.\nThe Centre for Computing\nServices and parts of Estates\nwere merged into the new\ndepartment of Information and\nCommunication Technology.\nImperial's RAG Sports Day\ntook place on a sunny Friday\nafternoon and raised over\n\u00a31,800 for the homeless\ncharity Shelter. The Sports\nDay Ball followed later that\nevening, with donations\nadding to the \u00a3900 that RAG raised during Freshers Week\nevents.\nFelix reported that the number of available parking\nspaces on the South\nKensington campus was due\nto plummet from 330 to just\n150 for the next two years as\nthe Dalby Court car park disappeared under the new College HQ building.\nThis was later increased to\n220, as the move was deeply\nunpopular with College's staff\nmotorists, and would also\nmean that the College would\nlose out on the income it generates from leasing spaces to\npunters at the Royal Albert\nHall,\nThe number of fresher s intending to apply to the College for\nthe October 2002 intake was\nplaced under scrutiny after\nFelix reported that potential\nstudents were considering\ndelaying their application to\ntake advantage of the possible\nreintroduction of student\ngrants for students starting\nuniversity in October 2003.\nThe Union's Beit Basements\nwere reopened by the broadcaster and journalist Trevor\nPhilips - a former Union\nPresident - and the Bishop of\nLondon, the Rt.

Speaking to Felix,\nhe said that the Union had \"lit-tle experience with running\nprojects of this scale and com-plex it y, and consequently the\nlearning curve has been\nexceedingly steep.\"\nDespite the fact that the ICU\nMedia Group societies were\nalso still awaiting the arrival of\nsome of their brand-new\nequipment, the basements\nproject was generally\nacknowledged as a success.\nBasics Pizzeria below\nSouthside Hall was replaced\nby an enlarged Southside\nshop, with a new fast food\nserver y,a wider range of\nyummy foodstuffs and extended opening hours.\nCollege decided to close\nBasics mainly because of the\nlarge losses - sometimes in\nexcess of \u00a3100,000 - that the\noutlet had been producing in\nthe past couple of years. Takeaways were apparently more\npopular than restaurant meals.\nDown in leafy Kent, the Wye\nCollege Union Society (WCUS)\nannounced that it was considering plans to move to new\npremises to comply with the\nDisability Discrimination Act,\nwhich comes into effect in2004. The Olave building - its current site - would require large\nscale renovation to comply\nwith the legislation and ensure\nadequate provision for the dis-able d, and it was thought that\nrelocating to the nearby ADAS\nbuilding might prove a more\ncost-effective solution.\nA visit to the Rector's house at\n170 Queens Gate by the\nChinese Vice President, Hu Jintao, caused commotion on\nthe South Kensington campus.\nA group of protesters turned\nout to draw attention to the\ncause of those persecuted in China for membership of the\nspiritual and meditative Falun\nGong movement, branded by the Chinese authorities as an\n'evil cult'. Police officers kept\norder at the Falmouth Gate\nentrance to College, where a group of Chinese students\nstudying in London had also\nassembled to greet Mr Hu.\nNovember\nA charged session of Union\nCouncil revealed that Union\nPresident, Sen Ganesh, intended to call a referendum on affiliation to the NUS.\nLome McEwan, former\nPresident of the Medics' Union\n(ICSMU) suggested the radical\nproposal of creating four new\nsabbatical positions; one for\neach of the four College faculties due to come into existence\non 1 August 2002.\nTo meet the costs of the new\npositions, Mr. McEwan proposed the abolition of the\nDeputy Presidents for\nEducation and Welfare, Clubs\nand Societies and also the Felix\nEditor as sabbatical positions.\nSenior College officials told\nFelix that the on-off Southside\nrefurbishment would now definitely take place in late 2003.\nAfter five years of planning the\nCollege was forced to move\nthe project to the top of its priority list because of concerns\nthat heating, water and ventilation services might fail.\nThere was no word on how\nCollege planned to fund the\n\u00a320 million project, though\nFelix was happy to speculate.\nThe Royal School of Mines\nbuilding was evacuated after\nsmoke was discovered in the\nRS M goes up in smoke\nfirst floor toilets. The cause of\nthe incident was later discovered to be contractors refurbishing the basement.\nAn emergency meeting of\nUnion Council was called to\ndiscuss restructuring the\nUnion in light of the College's new faculty structure.

    "content": "reviews music\nCee-Lo\nCee-Lo Green...\nOut now on Arista records\n[Full title: Cee-Lo Green And His Perfect\nImperfections]\nIt just goes to show that you can never\njudge an album by its cover - Cee-Lo\nlooks nothing less than a five-star hiphop fool on the front of his debut album,\nwith his flowing locks and top hat.\nAnd you can never judge an artist by\nhis lyrics. A preliminary glance at the\ninlay yielded such gems as \"Let me be,\nset me free, free, super chicken\". Indeed,\nnor should you judge an artist by the first\ntune on his album - Bad Mutha sounds\ntotally silly, and about as \"bad\" as an\nepisode of Jackanory. Because, bizarrely,\nit does get better.\nCee-Lo was once a coveted rapper\nwith Outkast, but has since gone solo,\npeddling a much more chilled brand of\nhip-hop on this, his long-awaited debut.\nAbout halfway through the album,\nthings get really interesting, because the\nmelodies become enjoyable and the\nlyrics stop being so stupid. One For The\nRoad has a suitably funky trumpet line,\nand Spend The Night In Your Mind\nblends what is almost a choir of voices\ntogether very nicely.\nHis rapping and singing fit together\nwell, even if it all sounds a little more\ntame than the efforts of some of the best\nhip-hop lyricists out there at the moment.\nAlso featured are the now commonplace\nrandom interludes, which are strangely\nentertaining, where Cee-Lo talks with\nhis homeboys about how he's the true\nlyrical master, or whatever.\nSo, not one to bang your head or shake\nyour fist to, but maybe you could nod a little and hum along.\nGonzales\nPresidential Suite\nOut now on Kitty Yo records\nHmm... what an odd little album. Quite\npossibly the most inexplicable thing I 've\never heard, but I 'll give it a go anyway.\nPresidential Suite contains a mysterious selection of musical styles, together\nwith rather a lot of silliness, the closest\ncomparison, perhaps, being with the\nBeastie Boys.\nChilly Gonzo (I kid you not, that's really what he calls himself) raps over quirky\nsynth tunes. Musically, it's not particularly good, but they clearly aren't taking\nthemselves seriously anyway. The single\nTake Me To Broadway is a good example\n- if you appreciated that, then you wont\nbe going far wrong with the album.\nHowever, things get a whole lot sillier.\nAs if from nowhere, the album suddenly\ngoes into a slow serenade, with haunting\n(female) lyrics, silly keyboards, the odd\ncameo appearance from Chilly, and, best\nof all, synthesized drum sounds all\nround. An interlude of haunted house\nmusic, and then back to \"normal\" for a bit.\nNow, I never expected to own an rap\nalbum containing a slow waltz. Not\nmany people would. Chilly demonstrates\nthat he can impersonate Matt Munroe,\n(not that you asked, mind) and you can\nalmost see the mirror ball.\nAs the album draws to a close, the random silliness shows no sign of a baiting( wasn't that a hint of In The Hall Of The\nMountain King?).\nPresidential Suite will stretch most\npeople's taste for the bizarre to its limit.\nYou'll either think that it's great in its\nown unique way, as I do, or that it's just\ncrap.\nFC Kahuna\nMachine Says Yes\nOut now on City Rockers\nIt would be sloppy and, surely, facile to\nbegin a review of FC Kahuna by comparing them to the Chemical Brothers.\nHowever, by saying that they are very\nmuch like the Chemical Brothers does\nmake my job a whole lot easier.\nFC Kahuna's debut album exhibits the\npanache, the versatility and the flair that\nwe might associate with a Chemical\nBrothers album, whilst showcasing what\nis distinctively their own stylistic dire c tion. In many ways, FC Kahuna's brand\nof music is more intimate than that of\ntheir counterparts: where others choose\ngrand explosions of sound and soaring\nintensity, FC Kahuna favour subtle inflections, and, on the more dancefloor-friend-ly tracks, sheer rhythmic muscle.\nThis album is glorious, and this is due\nin part to the great guest vocalists that\nhave been enlisted. Gruff Rhys, for exam-ple, makes his contribution in the form of\nthe beautiful opening track Fear Of\nGuitars, and Hafdis Huld's vocals are\ndeftly twisted into the head-scrambling\ntitle track Machine Says Yes.\nNow, if you are still unconvinced that\nthis album is worth your attention, then\njust get a listen to Nothing Is Wrong and\nNorth Pole Transmission. Because\nbetween these extremes, all of the other\ntracks lie. My personal favourite Nothing\nIs Wrong captures the experience of a pill-fuelled night out, as frantic and compulsive partying descends into claustrophobic paranoia.\nHopefully, FC Kahuna will go on to\nhave the success and the international\nacclaim that the Chemical Brothers now\nenjoy. Undoubtedly, they deserve it.\nDerek Jamie ID Patrick\n\n"

    "content": "talk felix\nEntertaining Angels\nThe old wisdom says, 'Don't look a gift\nhorse in the mouth.' That is of course\nunless it is a completely free handful of\ndelicious high quality chocolate. Last\nweek we were giving away, yes giving\naway, chocolate, biscuits, coffee, tea bags\nand fruit juice. It was all part of a series of\nevents to raise awareness of Fairtrade\nproducts and why they are important in\nan effort to end global poverty and world\nhunger. If you are a regular reader of this\ncolumn you will have taken the Fairtrade\nmessage to heart by now, so no further\nsermon ising on that issue!\nInstead I want to think about the experience some of us had standing of the walkway trying to give away a free sample of\na tasty morsel all in aid of a genuinely\ngood cause.\nMany people stopped and chatted,\nmunched and slurped and read the\nleaflets. Some came back for more, and a few came back and back. That was great.\nIt was a moment of freely given gifts.\nBut those of us dispensing the chocolate\nhad a common experience: we felt the\ndeep suspicion of many people who hurried past. \"Free chocolate - where is the\ncatch?\" \"What are you selling?\" \"What\nwill this cost me in time and energy to\nstop, find out what it is about and taste\nthe chocolate?\" Several volunteers felt\nthey wanted to have T shirts that said, 'I am a decent, pleasant human being really and I genuinely want to give you this\ngift, for free and there are no hidden\ncatches. HONEST!'\nNow some of us are shy, some of us are in\na hurry, and a few of us may have good\nreason to be wary because of previous\nbad experiences... but that still fails to\nexplain the huge number of people who\nhurried by, finding it impossible to believe\nthat something could be offered as a free\ngift with no catch. We seem to live in a society that, by and large, sees it as normal and acceptable to not get involved.\nNow, there are some good reasons to be\nwary of strangers, but mistrust and cynicism on this scale surely points to something wrong.\nOur freebie chocolate experience concerns me because of what it says about\nthe way we are being conditioned not to\nbe surprised. We are encouraged by\nunnecessary anxiety of urban life not to\ntake even a very safe risk, the risk of a fleeting encounter with a stranger.\nIs this about a deep cynicism towards\nanything offered for free? An avoidance of\nany unplanned encounters, an isolation\nfrom any surprising contact with others?\nNot all strangers are dangers, and (reas-sur ingly) not all contacts are conducted\nlike this. In some places, rural villages for\nexample, people stop to pass the time of\nday, to chat or simply to make eye contact\nand smile.\nIn the Judao-Christian tradition there is a valued story about Abraham, the father of\nmany nations. It runs like this: one day,\nsitting at the door of his tent, Abraham\nwas confronted by three mysterious\nstrangers passing by. He took the risk of\nhospitality, openness and human engage-ment, and (so the phrase was coined)\n'entertained angels unawares.' From that\nencounter he became the father of many\nnations precisely because of his open-ness, his willingness to engage. He took\nthe risk of being open. Shouldn't we?\nRadio: Impossible\nIt's an impossible mission: to sell science\nto a few thousand undergraduates who,\nday in and day out, live and breathe sci-en ce, and who are quite possibly utterly\nbored with it. But impossible missions\nsuit some people just fine, and those are\nthe committed people studying science\ncommunication. Tune in to IC Radio\nbetween 6 and 7 on Thursday evenings,\nand you will be admitted into the world of\nMission Impossible.\nThe Mission Impossible show is to science what napalm is to a bail of hay -except that while napalm would destroy\nyour average haystack, Mission\nImpossible merely chooses to ignite science with a refreshing brand of humour\nand intrigue.\nWhat will you hear? Rest assured that\nImperial's science communication students are out searching for the best science news every week, ready and packaged for you in a five-minute burst of current affairs. And any topical science news\nduring the week will be digested and\ndebated during the show, with special\nguests from such places as the Science\nMuseum.\nMission Impossible also promises to\nbring you fiction and drama on the radio.\nThere's Imperial College's first ever radio\nsoap opera, 'Empirical College,' which\nthe production team would like to call a comedy series, if only the plot didn't involve quite so much infidelity. And the\nshow's special reporter Stian Reimers\nproduces a weekly update on the science\nwars - the eternally raging battle\nbetween those who believe science\nsearches for the 'truth', and those who\nargue that science just a piece of modern\nculture.\nOr, does anyone enjoy a quiz? There's a different science quiz on mission impossible every week, and most recently the\nproduction team came up with the first\n'Science Call My Bluff show. For example,\ndo you think 'bath y col pian' is a bout of\nunexpected depression, or a deep, fleshy\ncleft? And do you think the Mission\nImpossible show is unnecessarily vulgar?\nAnswers can be sent to our e mail\naddress: imperial radio@ hotmail.com.\nThere's also a weekly update on what's new, what's hot, and what positively\nstinks, in the world of technology and\ngadgets.\nIf you read this before 20 June, then be\nsure to check out Mission Impossible's end-of-term-special - a show purely\ndevoted to the study of where science is\ntoday. What does science mean to you?\nWhy do you study science, and why is\nscience important?\nMission Impossible will also be running\nover the summer, and as with all of the IC\nRadio shows, you can listen and download at www.ic radio. com. Remember, science isn't just about the cold and clinical\nsearch for the truth - it's about fun,\nintrigue, humour, and above all, the\nhuman beings who actually do it.\n\n"

It was a surprisingly pleasant afternoon,\nand I found myself looking out\nover some of the greener parts\nof London with one of IC's few\npredominantly female clubs,\nall of them brandishing whips\nand many clad in long, leather\nboots.\nThis was, in fact, the riding\nclub's inaugural annual show\njumping competition, held at\nthe London Equestrian Centre\nin Mill Hill last friday, the fourteenth of June.\nThe competition was spilt\ninto three categories - begin-ner, novice and open - and\nalthough there was a strong\nEquestrian Antics\nshowing in the latter classes\nonly one beginner turned up\non the day.

This class\nrather than being a sim-ple, timed, clear round\nwas split into two sec-t ions. Initially all the\ncompetitors did one\nround of the course,\nand those who comp let it successfully proceeded into the jump off.\nNicola and Rachel made it\nthrough to the jump off,\nafter Jess and Anna picked up a number of\nfaults and refusals in the\nfirst round, with Ruth C's horse unfortunately tripping and falling at the penultimate fence and unseating her.\nYou will be pleased to know,\nhowever, that the running of\nthe Union is not in jeopardy as\nshe escaped with nothing\nmore than a few bruises, and\nthe horse too received no serious injuries.\nThe jump off proceeded as\nplanned and after excellent\nrounds by both, Nicola was\ndeemed to have beaten Rachel\nby the narrowest of margins.\nThe afternoon was concluded with the beginners' class,\nwhich was won in some style\nby Karim, after a very convincing ride.\nMany thanks must go to\nGemma for such a well run\ncompetition, and let's hope\nthat there are many more to\ncome.\nThe Club rides every week,\nand if you want to join them\nthen e mail riding@ic.ac.uk.\nAlex\nTaking a year's Break?\nNeed a filler which involves good\noffice work experience?\nStudent Activities Assistant\nImperial College Union has a vacancy for a part-time\nadministrative assistant (24 or36 weeks term-time\nonly, 10:30am6:30p mM F) to provide support to the\nStudent Activities Co-or d in at or.

    "content": "medicine feature\nMedicine In The Digital Age\nLooking at the changes in the lifestyle of\nour parents' and grandparents' lives it is\nhard to disagree that life has improved\nsubstantially. Every decade has seen a technological revolution. If the '70s,'80 s, and '90s have seen semiconductors, PCs\nand the Internet respectively, in the 21st century 'pervasive computing' will be\npoised to transform our lives. This would\nmark a fundamental transition in medicine with an increasing adoption of pervasive computing and broadband networks in the provision of high quality\ncare. Today, the network and computer\nare as essential to providing medical care\nas the stethoscope and reflex hammer.\nThis new environment of bits and optical\npulses is transforming virtually every\naspect of medical care. This text addresses the opportunities central to our transition to a 'digital age' in medicine.\nSo, here's a sneak preview: I have been\nassimilated. I am hooked up to an electronic device 24 hours. And I love it! This\nis how many people might feel in the not-so-far future. If you are asking why?, then\nthink about this.\nThe Smart Medical Home (SMH) is a project at the Center for Future Health,\nUniversity of Rochester in collaboration\nwith MIT's Media Laboratory. According\nto Philippe Fauchet one of the co-founders, \"today we wait until you get\nsick, drag yourself to the doctor, and then\nwe throw this multi million dollar heroic\ntechnology at you. So we wondered if it\nwas possible to do early detection, even\nbefore you got sick, with technology that\nis very inexpensive, consumer friendly,\nand doesn't require a complex change in\nlifestyle.\"\nThe Smart Medical Home would include\na series of devices working in conjunction\nin the home to monitor a family's health.\nWith the present work on networking protocols like Bluetooth, etc, it is not far\nbefore we could realise such a smart\nhome.\nConsider placing an adhesive bandage\non a cut, and having the bandage tell you\nimmediately that dangerous bacteria\nhave got into the wound and you need to\nseek a doctor's help. Once you scan your\nbandage, the chip will connect to a home\nPC responsible for monitoring residents'\nhealth, reporting what kind of bacteria is\npresent. The house will check a medical\ndatabase via the web to determine what\nkind of treatment is necessary, confer\nwith other sensors that have been monitoring your gait for signs of stroke, your\nskin for signs of melanoma, and your medicine cabinet to make sure you haven't been taking anything that may conflict\nwith any new medication, and suggest to\nyou in spoken English (or for that matter\nA Smart Medical Home\nany language you prefer) what steps you\nneed to take to treat your infection.\nCripes, hypochondriac alert...\nThe California-based Stanford\nUniversity Medical Center and Providence\nEverett Medical Center in Seattle,\nWashington, became the first two medical\nfacilities in the United States to implant\nBiotronik's novel pacemaker, which features home monitoring technology. Home\nmonitoring is the first technology of its\nkind to be approved by the Food and Drug\nAdministration, and is anticipated to revolutionize the way physicians currently\nmonitor their pacemaker patients.\nThe home monitoring system implanted\nis one of the most exciting technologies\nthat have been developed in the field of\narrhythmia management. This technology\nwill serve as a platform to deliver true\n21st century patient care by allowing\nphysicians to provide more prompt\nresponse as well as more complete\npatient management to those with\narrhythmia problems.\nWith home monitoring, the pacemaker\ncan be customized to automatically transmit a detailed car dio report to the physician's office on a daily or weekly basis, or\nif the patient experiences a significant\nchange in their heart condition, allowing\nthe patient's clinician to be able to\nrespond more effectively to their patients'\nchanging cardiac status.\nThis remote wireless pacemaker could\nbecome a critical tele medicine app lica tion, where cardiologists could monitor\ntheir patients with car dio vascular conditions anywhere in the world. In the future,\nconsumers will use personal medical\ntechnology in the privacy of their homes\nto maintain health, detect the onset of\ndisease and to manage disease proactive-iy.\nAnother area of interest in the way\ntechnology is being used for medical\nmonitoring is 'Smart clothing,' that not\nonly has the capability to make you look\nsmart but would be able to think as well.\nVivoMetrics of Ventura, California, have\nbegun beta-testing its LifeShirt.

    "content": "clubbing reviews\nINTERVIEW with\nFC Kahuna\nBridge & Tunnel,\nOld Street\nFor years, FC Kahuna have stood in the\nwings and watched the rise and rise of\ncontemporaries such as The Chemical\nBrothers and Fatboy Slim. But with the\nrelease of their debut LP Machine Says\nYes, they are about to jump boldly into\nthe limelight.\nA couple of weeks ago, I met up with\nDan Kahuna...\nFELIX: So you guys have just finished\nthe debut album, but why did it take\nover two years to make?\nDAN: We knew it was going to have to\ntake a while, as we really didn't want to\ndo what everybody expected of us. That\nmeant that we had to find something a bit different, something unique, so we\njust had to spend a lot of time experimenting until we found it. We were\nalways trying out new ideas.\nThe album features some great colla bo rations, such as Gruff Rhys' vocal on\nFear Of Guitars. What was it like working with these people?\nEveryone seems to moan that it's difficult to get collaborations off the ground\nand that it's difficult to get people\ninvolved, but we didn't have anything\nlike that. We worked with people who\nwe'd already met - it wasn't like a big\ncorporate endeavour.\nAny particular memories?\nWorking with Gruff was brilliant. We had\nwanted to work with him for ages, and\nonce, when we were in the studio, we\nsaw him there. We were daring each\nother to go and ask him, and in the end,\nJon went over and Gruff was like \"Yeah,\n'course. Cool\". He later came into the\nstudio with us and started singing this\nsea shanty - it was mental - singing\nthings like: [imitates Gruff] \"I got fishy,\nfishy fingers pointing at me\" and \"bread\ncrumb hands are strangling me\". Jon\nand I sat there and got steadily more and\nmore stoned in the studio. We thought it\nwas hilarious and so we weren't being\nthat constructive as to whether he was\ngoing overboard or not. The next day,\nGruff rang us up and said: \"Hello, er, I think I may have gone a little bit over the\ntop\".\nWas your long-standing residency at\nHeadstart a testing ground for the\ntracks on the album?\nBefore Headstart, we had been running\nthe Big Kahuna Burger night in bars and\nbasements, with crap sound systems.\nWhen we went to Headstart, it was this\nbig warehouse y place with a half-decent\nsound system - a complete change.\nPlaying there really nurtured our appreciation of space.\nLastly, you and Jon have been working\ntogether for seven years. What has it\nbeen like?\nIt's been good. It's had its ups and\ndowns - it can get a bit annoying sitting\nin the same room, year after year, with\nthe same ugly blok e. No, he's not a bad\nblok e... Ultimately, we've done some\ngood things and we've enjoyed our-selves, and we've been to some great\nplaces. What more would you need?\nSituated within ten minutes' walk of Old\nStreet tube station, this new DJ bar is a good place to head to on a Monday night,\nshould you feel like continuing your\nweekend.\nUnfortunately, the opening night was\nfull of annoying media types, so it is difficult to say much about the people who\ngo there.\nRegardless of the clientele, the atmosphere of the place was impressive, created by great DJs playing the tunes they\nwant to play, and by the informal, meandering layout of the newly designed\nvenue.\nThe Bridge and Tunnel has two floors -the basement and ground level. The\nbasement has an old school-style sound\nsystem and a small dance floor, which\ngives the place a back-in-the-day feel.\nThe music in the basement depends on\nthe night you go; we were lucky enough\nto be treated to an excellent mixture of\nbreakbeat and deep house.\nThe ground floor is more like a normal\nbar, with nice lighting, a long bar and a great seating area - brilliant to just laze\naround and chat while listening to DJs\nmixing it up in the background. James\nLavelle and Ross Allen were present on\nthe opening night, but on an ordinary\nMonday the Bridge and Tunnel's residency is held by Ross Allen and Tony\nFarsides.\nThe one major drawback about this\nplace is its location - were it in South\nKen, it would be continuously packed\nwith Imperial students. But as the Bridge\nand Tunnel is situated in Old Street, the\nhandy tube is needed, which could be a bit too much hassle for a night out.\nDespite this, it is well worth a visit.\nPatrick TobyB\n\n"

College\nauthorities were notified and\nhe was escorted from his office\nby security officers.\nA man was arrested under\nsuspicion of theft in the vicinity of Beit Hall when he was\napprehended with several\nitems of stolen electronics in\nhis possession.\nThe man - who was on bail\nat the time of his arrest - was\nknown to both security and the\npolice, and had previously\nassaulted some of the\nCollege's security officers.\nFelix revealed that College\nauthorities had approved\nplans to sell Clayponds hall of\nresidence in the summer of\n2003 for an estimated \u00a38m, raising doubts about the\nCollege's ability to meet its\nguarantee of providing accommodation to all first-year\nundergraduates.\nThe sale of Clayponds - situated in Ealing and housing 332\nstudents, mostly first year\noverseas postgraduates\nwould coincide with planned\nrefurbishments to both\nSouthside and Bernard Sunley\nhalls, meaning that College\nwould have to find an extra\n330 bed spaces just to keep its\nguarantee to fresher s.An angry meeting of the\nUnion Executive Committee\nestablished that students had\nnot been consulted regarding\nthe proposed sell-off. Senior\nCollege officials tried to portray the decision as \"cock-up,\nnot conspiracy,\" and agreed\nthat the student body should\nhave been informed of the\nplans in advance.\nConcerns over student accommodation deepened when the\nsale of Clayponds was con-firmed. It was also revealed\nthat the College had insufficient cash to fund the planned\nrefurbishment of the Southside\nhalls, yet was still intent on\nbuilding a new \u00a312.7m headquarters building on the South\nKensington campus.\nAn interim balance sheet\napproved by College Council\nshowed that \u00a330m was\nexpected to be raised through\nthe sale of student residences,\nyet only \u00a38m was to be\nploughed into residences\nrefurbishment with the rest\nbeing diverted into the new\nHQ project and sports hall\nredevelopment. The possibility\nof privat ising Southside halls\nwas raised as a possible solution to the funding crisis.\nMeanwhile, proposals to\nallow students to stay in\nLinstead, Southside and\nWeeks halls over the Easter\nvacation were approved in\nresponse to complaints from\nstudents and their parents\ninconvenienced by having to\nmove out at the end of the\nspring term and then move\nback shortly before the onset\nof the summer exams.\nIn an interview with the\nFinancial Times, the Rector, Sir\nRichard Sykes, was alleged to\nhave called for the creation of a group of elite universities\nrivalling the American 'Ivy\nLeague' to place Britain at the\nforefront of science education.\nSir Richard - a member of the\nGovernment's Council for\nScience and Technology and\nthe new Science Policy\nStrategy Board of the\nDepartment of Trade and\nIndustry - called for the establishment of around twelve universities that would be able to\ncharge students tuition fees at\nmarket rates. These could\nexceed \u00a310,000 each year,\npotentially enabling scientific\ninstitutions to attract the best\nstudents and research staff by\noffering the \"best conditions in\nthe world.\"\nHis words were seen as a warning to Tony Blair, who\nrecently told the Royal Society\nthat he wanted to make the UK\n\"one of the best places in the\nworld to do science.\"\nSummer Ball revellers\nClayponds: going in 2003?\nJune\nFirefighters were called to the\nCharing Cross campus over\nthe Golden Jubilee Bank\nHoliday when an electrical\nfault caused a generator to\nspill diesel oil within the hos-pital.

If nothing is done, we could be faced\nwith a black out. There will be a controlled\nshutdown of sub-stations on a least priority basis which means Southside residences, then Sherfield, will be shed, followed by the academic departments.\nLast summer, even with an automatic\nload-shedding system that intermittently\nswitched off non-essential loads for short\ndurations, the South Kensington campus\nfrequently came within a few percent of\nits maximum available power limit of 11\nmegawatts. New refurbishment projects\nin many departments has added extra\nload to the supply, and it is forecast that\ndemand will exceed the limit this summer.\nSummer is the time when the problem\nbecomes apparent because of the extra\nelectricity required for cooling systems\nand air conditioning.\nStandby generators will be used this\nsummer in three main buildings and that\nwill help to reduce the excess demand.\nHowever, these measures alone will not\nbe enough to reduce the demand to 11\nmegawatts. The Estates Department has\nbeen taking precautions to prevent this\nhappening in future years; there are plans\nto increase the supply available by laying\na new cable through Hyde Park by 2003.\nThe only way to prevent a black-out this\nsummer is to reduce the electricity\ndemand, especially during the main periods 10.30 - 15.30 Monday to Friday, but of\ncourse we want to be saving electricity all\nof the time. So what can you do to avoid an\nelectrical shutdown in summer 2002?\nThere are some simple housekeeping\nhabits that could make a sufficient difference if everybody follows these guide-lines:\n\u2022Set air conditioning thermostat controls to a minimum of 22\u00b0C.A1 \u00b0C saving on room temperature saves 10% of\nthe heating/cooling energy.\n\u2022Switch off unnecessary main lights.\nMake best use of daylight and local task\nlighting. Every kW of lighting power\nused in every room has to be removed\nby 0.35 kW of cooling power, so equipment left on wastes power twice over.\n\u2022Ensure that blinds are kept down to\nprevent excessive solar gains, which\nwould have to be cooled. If blinds are\nleft up overnight, the sun will already\nbe cooking your room by 09.00 the next\nday when you arrive.\n\u2022Keep doors and windows closed in\ncooled rooms.\n\u2022 Fume cupboards waste fan power and\nremove all the expensively cooled air.\nHelp by not using fume cupboards as\nchemical stores and close off all nonessential systems\n\u2022If you have a choice, try to restrict use\nof high power consumption equipment\nsuch as lasers, glass washers, compressors, large pumps/motors and sterilis-ers during peak periods.\n\u2022Switch off unused PCs, which waste\npower and add to the cooling load. As a minimum, switch off the monitor when\nunattended, as this will reduce the\nwork station's power use by almost\n75%.\n\u2022Assist your department in identifying\nnon-essential equipment, which can be\nadded to the load shedding system.\nFor further information you can contact\nthe energy manager, Michael Parry on\nm.k. parry@ic.ac.uk.\n\n"

    "content": "books feature\nHay Book Festival\nIt seems that most of the nation have given themselves over to\nsome form of patriotic fer v our, either sporting or royalist, but\nhere in a small Welsh town just north of the Black mountains,\nanother form of passion is in the ascendant. In Hay-on-Wye the\ncrowds come to worship at literary shrines. The week-long Hay\nFestival programme includes an international list of writers,\nfrom star names to new voices promoting their first novels.\nHaving unpacked at a hotel in Bredwardine, a few miles from\nthe festival site and the final home of the famous diarist Kilvert,\nI make my way into Hay on Saturday evening for my first festival event. This is a poetry reading by Linton Kwesi Johnson, for\n30 years a champion of the Afro-Caribbean community, a second generation member of an immigrant family; the \"rebel gen-e ration,\" as he calls it. He is reading from a new volume of\nselected verse which spans the whole of his writing career, Me\nRevalueshannary Fren published by Penguin Modern Classics\n[paperback, \u00a36.99]. LK J comes from the oral tradition of\nJamaican poetry. The printed verse is written in phonetic\nEnglish. The voice and the rhythm rise clearly from the page,\nbut nothing equals the power of live delivery. LK J holds the\nbook before him, checks the opening line, but never looks down\nagain as he recites directly to the middle of the marquee. The\npoetry lives in the performance. \"No applause between poems\nplease. I'm as vain as the next man, but I 've got a lot I want to\nMichael Frayn\nread this evening\", and so we hear selections from his\nSeventies, Eighties and Nineties verse. Much of this poetry\nreflects the times in which it was written and LK J sets the context for each poem, although this isn't really necessary to\nappreciate the power and subtlety of the message. My main\nmisgivings are that the audience are 99% white, (100%\nGuardian readers I imagine) and there is a faint smell of cultural tourism here; from the nods and cheers you might have\nthought some members were tapping into a wealth of shared\nexperience in poverty, prejudice and oppression. LK J is in command though. He controls the show effortlessly and leaves the\ncrowd wanting more.\nMichael Frayn, former journalist, now playwright, novelist\nand translator, is another author who knows how to entertain a crowd. On Sunday, as the audience begins to wilt in the stifling\nheat of the 'Orange Word' marquee, Frayn gives an inspiring\ntalk on the nature of childhood memories; how the seemingly\nunrelated fragments that we tend to recollect without any\nsense of chronology in fact hold the key to much of our early\ndevelopment and our changing perceptions of the world. In his\nlatest novel Spies, [Faber, 2002, hardback \u00a314.99] Frayn uses\nmemories of his own childhood in the suburbs of south London\nduring the second world war, (which he recalls as a big ad ven ture, with no sense of the danger involved) as the starting point\nfor a story which demonstrates how children exercise their\nimaginations to try and make sense of the world, which during\nwartime seems even more skewed and perplexing than normal.\nThere are two mam characters in Spies, Stephen and Keith, both\neleven year old schoolboys. The narrative is from Stephen's point of view, the poorer of the two friends. He attends the state\nschool, has fewer toys and competes with his older brother for\nhis parents' attention, but he is clearly part of a loving family\nunit although he may feel envious of Keith; an only child destined for prep school, with a room full of pristine possessions.\nKeith's father however is a monster and his treatment of his\nfamily is horribly abusive. The main plot of the novel centres on\nKeith's wild assertion that his mother is really a German spy.\nThe boys begin to follow her about the neighbourhood, but their\nprying accidentally uncovers a real mystery, with calamitous\nconsequences. Frayn is wholly successful in seeing events\nthrough a child's eyes, maintaining the fine balance between\nthe comedy of their misinterpretation of the adult world, and\nthe tragedy that their games bring about. This achievement is\nrecognised at Hay with a Bollinger award; a case of vintage\nchampagne and a pig named in his honour, (it isn't made clear\nif the pig is to called 'Michael' or 'Spies').\nOn Monday the fine weather finally breaks, which seems\nappropriate as Joanne Harris is appearing to talk about the\nflood plagued island community in her new novel Coastliners\n[Doubleday, 2002, hardback \u00a312.991. The PA system is also playing up, but Harris politely declines when her interviewer suggests they share the microphone attached to her ample bosom.\nAt this point it looks as if the session might quickly degenerate\ninto farce, but order is restored and Harris talks on a wide variety of topics such as finding your true author i al voice, (she was\nwriting for more than a decade, experimenting with gothic\n\n"

The film option to\nCoastliners has already been sold and this time she is writing\nthe screenplay herself. The novel is her most ambitious work to\ndate, portraying two rival communities fighting to survive on\nan inhospitable island on the French Atlantic coast. The main\ncharacter in this drama is Mado, who has returned to the island\nafter ten years. When her parents separated, she lived with her\nmother in Paris, gradually building a reputation as a painter.\nFollowing her mother's death, she returns to the island to seek\na reconciliation with her father, a withdrawn, silent man, who\nwas once the island's main boat builder. The local population\nhas remained fairly static in the years since Mado left, but there\nis an important new arrival from Ireland, the enigmatic Flynn.\nEmploying a number of devices, Flynn manages to manipulate\nthe inhabitants, and by persuading them to construct sea\ndefences, brings prosperity to the poorer side of the island.\nMado is drawn into his scheming, but only gradually does she\nbecome aware of the true nature of his designs. There are many\ntwists towards the end of the book, but as Harris says, she is\nessentially an optimist, so you can be assured that something\npositive will be salvaged from what appear to be terrible odds.\nShe is certainly a prolific writer, with the first draft of her next\nnovel already completed. It is set in a seventeenth century\nFrench convent, where for political reasons an eleven year old\ngirl has been appointed head. Later on Monday the storms have\npassed and William Boyd takes the stage in the 'Orange Word'\nmarquee. Boyd is a different sort of celebrity; he seems to have\na rather breathless tribe of groupies in his wake. He's also saddled with John Walsh as interviewer, a man with a huge ego\nwho overplays his \"good mates with the author\" card. In earlier books Boyd has attempted fictional memoirs (The New\nConfessions) and a celebrated hoax biography {Nat Tate). His\nnew book Any Human Heart, [Hamish Hamilton, 2002, hardback\n\u00a317.99] is a similar conceit, being the intimate journals of another fictional character, Logan Mountstuart. He claims that the\ndiary form gives the novel an immediacy without the commentary of autobiography such as \"if I had only known then that\nIn fact what these faux diaries lack is the mass of un directed, inconsequential and mundane events of a real life. Each\nsection recorded here reaches a natural climax, like a well\nstructured novel and it is a much better book because the real\nauthor is unable to hide his craftsmanship.\nBoyd says that he promised himself never to revisit the territory of public school life, but if Mountstuart was to follow the\ntraditional path of the early twentieth century writer then this\nwas one of the obligatory rites of passage, together with a mediocre student career at Oxford and the early attempts to\nestablish himself as a writer in London. Mountstuart has two\ngreat friends from school, Leeping and Scabius, (Walsh can't help commenting on Boyd's choice of outlandish names) and he\nmaintains contact within them throughout his life and in many\nways uses them to gauge his success in the world, (Leeping\nruns art galleries in Paris and New York, Scabius becomes a popular writer). Boyd says that to make Mountstuart a be liev: Ian McEwan able minor figure in the footnotes of twentieth century literary\nhistory, he had to integrate his activities with real events and\nbring him into contact with significant writers of the period. So\nwe find Mountstuart eavesdropping on a Bloomsbury gathering\nat Garsington, encountering James Joyce in Paris and\nHemingway during the Spanish Civil War and extensive meetings with the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who appear as\nghastly characters involved in the cover up of a murder in the\nBahamas. Boyd stresses that this part of the novel is based on\nreal evidence. He also seems to be doing his best to tarnish the\nreputation of Virginia Woolf, who is portrayed here as vain,\nspiteful and snobbish. It seems odd that he is so anxious to\nknock the elitism of Bloomsbury when he takes such pleasure in\nrecounting the Nat Tate hoax, carried out with the help of\ncelebrity friends such as David Bowie. Could he possibly be trying to emulate Woolf's involvement in the Dreadnaught affair of\n1910? On Monday evening Pete McCarthy gives us a taste of his\nnew book The Road to McCarthy, which is published next\nmonth; more travellers tales, but this time not limited to the\npublic houses of Ireland. The closing event for my time at the\nfestival is a concert by Baaba Maal, the great Senegalese musician with his fantastic dancers. I spot Ian McEwan slipping\naway after half an hour of the performance, but perhaps he's had a long day as well. He's due to give a talk in the morning.\nAfter all, Hay is where writers have to sing for their supper.\nAdrian\n\n"

    "content": "LIVE: System Of A Down +\nThe Dillinger Escape Plan\n@ Brixton Academy\nThis is unquestionably the hottest rock ticket in town. Three\nshows at the 5,000-capacity Academy, all sold out about four\nmonths in advance, together with a host of other venues sold\nout across the nation, would suggest that anticipation is running a little high.\nThe Dillinger Escape Plan (pic above) are the only rock band\ncapable, and insane, enough to cover Aphex Twin and make it\nsound better than the original. On record, they are an utterly\nblistering fusion of extreme metal, free jazz and punk rock.\nUnbelievably, when they play live, they really pull it off, making\neverything faster, louder, p hatter and heavier.\nStage antics are at a maximum as they go apes hit, hurling\nthemselves off speaker stacks and ploughing into the crowd\nand each other. Unfortunately, they go down like a turd sandwich with much of the audience, although the ten-or-so one-man mosh pits( mine included) and healthy applause suggest\nthat several of the more enthusiastic onlookers certainly appreciate their efforts.\nWhere the Plan are a study in wild chaotic excess, System Of A Down are brutally regimented. Each riff is spat out, every\npolemic lyric barked, crooned, shrieked or gurgled. The opener\nis perhaps the model SOAD track Prison Song, with its chugging\nguitars, its sudden turn-on-the-spot switches from noise to\nsilence, and, most importantly, its massive catchy chorus that\ngets everyone jumping.\nSystem ensure that the kids go home tired but ecstatic. They\nare probably one of the oddest mainstream bands around today,\nas they fearlessly mix together modern metal and their\nArmenian folk roots with gleeful abandon. But the important\nthing is that it works, again and again and again, for each 180\nsecond salvo.\nmusic reviews\nLIVE: The Cooper Temple\nClause + Biffy Clyro +\nOceansize @ Astoria\nThe first band on were Oceansize. Based in Manchester,\nalthough apparently from all around the country, they blew\neveryone away. Completely.\nI'm used to walking into gigs slightly late and there being\nloads of room on the floor, with people sitting down and half-lis-ten ing to the support - but not today. The Astoria was already\ntotally packed out, with people peering over each other at the\nstage, listening in awe at the amazing prog-rock with devilish\nundertones - take Matt Bellamy's guitar playing and the drums\nfrom Tool, and you're not far off. Go see them! Now!\nThe Biffy Clyro set was disappointing. Although the boys\nthemselves were on good form and played right the way\nthrough 27, 37, 47 and 57, the sound was shocking. I wanted to\nhear beautiful rock music again, but the drums and bass were\nup too high and the vocals were completely screwy, with\nSimon's mic much louder than anyone else's. The band (pic above) made a valiant effort to keep it up, but I think we were all secretly glad when their set came to an end.\nLaunching straight into Did You Miss Me?, The Cooper Temple\nClause were itching to get on with it, but they were still coherent and composed, and they rocked the joint like they always\ndo. They played every single track from the album except 555-4823. Unfortunately, Murder Song was completely desecrated\nby feedback and interference. Sort it out!\nThey also previewed a new song, which may or may not have\nhad a name. Absent fans will be glad to know that it was in the\nsame vein as most of the songs on their album - The Coopers\nhave found a niche, and they're sticking to it.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Kunal Jess\n\n"

The\nAGM is your chance to hear what your\nUnion is doing for you, the students, by\nstudents.\nThis year, the Union underwent a huge\nconstitutional change to fall in line with\nthe College's new faculty structure. While\nthis took much time and work, we're confident that we are now better equipped to\nrepresent you to your departments, and\nensure you receive the education you\ndeserve. We also abolished the distinction\nbetween postgraduate and undergraduate students.\nThis year also saw a dramatic development in the services available to students.\nThe basements in Beit Quad were completely refurbished, and now provide a state of the art media centre, dark room\nand science-fiction library in the West\nWing. The East Wing houses the\nChaplaincy, Union Advice Centre, RAG office and MicroClub, providing urgently\nneeded student support services. The\nCharing Cross refurbishment was also\ncompleted, greatly improving the entertainment services at the campus. The\ngyms have also been refurbished at Wye,\nCharing Cross and Silwood.\nThe Union relies heavily on volunteers to\nhelp it run. This year, the Higher\nEducation Funding Council established\nthe Active Community Fund to encourage\nrecognition of volunteers. Even before this,\nthe Union was working to better support\nthe volunteers that form the backbone of\nits activities. A new student activities co-or d in at or, Nicholas Gore, has been\nappointed to help run the clubs and societies aspect of the Union. Training will\nnow be provided to club volunteers at the\nbeginning of next year, and the student\nactivities centre is now located in the East\nWing basement, closer to these support\nservices.\nThis year has seen some great events\norganised by students. Most recently, the\nSummer Ball was a huge success after the\nRector kindly donated \u00a320,000 towards the\nevent. Thanks go to all the Summer Ball\nteam. International Night dazzled a vast\naudience last term, and the RAG Sports\nDay filled the Queen's Lawn with bizarrely\ndressed athletes. This year, along with\nRAG, Imperial students have raised over\n\u00a3100,000 pounds for good causes.\nFinally, I'd like to thank all those people\nwho give their time to run and take part in\nthe Union. I look forward to welcoming\nmany back next year, and to those that are\nleaving, the best of luck.

Dance\nmusic was provided upstairs by, amongst\nothers, Mark Home, the Scratch Perverts\nand Timmi Magic.\nLess than a week after the Queen's Golden Jubilee celebrations had lit up the\nnight sky of central London, the residents\nof South Kensington were treated to\nanother impressive fireworks display,\nwhich was launched from the roof of the\nSherfield building at the stroke of mid-night, and considered to not have been far\nshort of the Buckingham Palace offering.\nThe feel-good nature of the event was\nmarred however by a group of students\nwho saw fit to steal confectionery, biscuits and other items from the Senior\nCommon Room, also unsuccessfully\nattempting to steal some of the alcohol on\noffer later in the evening. College Security\nhave made it known that they have clear,\ncolour CCTV footage of the men and\nwomen involved in these incidents, and\nstrongly advise them to make themselves\nknown to Security.

I have\nbeen looking back in the past,\nand there have generally been\nmany thanks bits and stuff\ndone by all the editors, and\nsome rambling, etc.\nI'm not going to do that.\nFirstly, I don't really believe in\nselecting people when I know\nI 'll forget others who have\nbeen more important; secondly because I have such a bad\nmemory for names that I can't remember most of them; third-ly, I'm much too lazy to have\nto think about it that hard,\nwhen all I really want to do is\ngo to bed, and fourthly I find it\nall rather maudlin, and I 've\nalways been rather bad at\ngoodbyes. Especially when it's my friends who are lea v ing, and not me.\nThis is the third year now when I 've had to say goodbye\nto friends I 've made at IC. I suppose it's my own fault for\nbeing here so long, and I suppose I enjoy it on some level,\nbut in the end it is always sad\nto have your friends moving\non around you, and for you to\nbe left alone like the nowhere\nman at the end of that song by\nthe Beatles in Yellow\nSubmarine. But I have met\nand made friends with many\npeople I have felt very strongly for, and it is sadly likely that\nI will never see many of them\nagain. So to you I would like to\nsay that while I may not be\nthe most honest person about\nfacts, I am honest about feel-in gs, and I can promise categorically that I have never lied\nto anyone about how I have\nfelt. If you leave this\nUniversity thinking I loved\nyou, then I most probably did.\nSorry about this rather\ndepressing turn, but up until\nnow I have been running\naround wildly trying to get\nthings done, and it was only\nonce I started writing this\nvery column that I realised\nthat this was, as they say, it.\nSo yes. I realise that this\nisn'ta very terminal Felix. No\nheartfelt goodbyes, and no\nlong winded rants about\nthings that have pissed me\noff. This is possibly because\nI'm not easily angered (at\nleast for long), and possibly\nbecause I'm too lazy to bother.\nAside from all this, I would\nlike to ask all of you who are\nmoving on whether you feel\nyou've made the most of your\ntime here (and this coming\nfrom someone who has possibly made too much of his time\nhere). I hope you all feel that\nstrange feeling that I do of joy\nand sadness combined when\nyou leave knowing (and I realise I sound trite, but I'm really not very poetic) that\nsomething wonderful has\nended, that will hopefully be\nreplaced with something even\nbetter.\nI said I wasn't going to say\nany thank-yous, but I'm having trouble reaching the end\nwithout mentioning some of\nthe people who have made\nthis year wonderful, so I will\ndo it with references.

    "content": "Teddington: likely to be sold during the summer vacation\ncontinued from page 15\nDecember\nThe first round of College-wide\nweb-based Lecturer\nEvaluation Questionnaires\nwent online. David Francis, the\nDeputy President for\nEducation and Welfare, promised in a Felix article that \"this\ntime it's as robust as a tank\nbuilt by the A Team.\"\nUnfortunately, the scheme\nfailed to run entirely to plan,\nwith security breaches and\nstudent apathy ruining the\norganisers' attempts to get a representative sample of student opinion.\nFelix reported that students\nfrom the Department of\nComputing had uncovered\nsecurity flaws that one \"could\ndrive Texas through,\" casting\nserious doubts on the validity\nof any survey carried out using\nthe system. Worse still, the\nengineers in charge of constructing the system had been\nadvised of these security problems a year ago.\nJanuary\nA confidential College document confirmed that the\nTeddington sports ground is\nlikely to be sold during the\n2002 summer vacation.\nUnsurprisingly, most medics\nare upset by the proposals.\nAside from the question of\n70 years of tradition, the major\nargument against the development of these grounds is the\nsuperior quality of the land;\nTeddington is regarded as one\nof the best sports pitches in\nthe South of England.\nWork began on the \u00a327m Tanaka project, which will see\nthe construction of a brand\nnew site for the College's Business School on its\nExhibition Road f agade. The\nproject was made possible by\na donation from IC alumnus Dr.\nGary Tanaka.\nThe second question and\nanswer session by the Rector\ntook place in the Great Hall,\nwhere Sir Richard outlined his\nplans to strengthen the\nImperial College brand.\nIt was revealed that the\nCollege had applied for its own\ndegree-awarding powers\nwhich, if granted, would see it\ngain independence from the\nUniversity of London by 2007.\nThe Rector also confirmed\nthat Garden Hall will be sold -apparently to provide funding\nfor the Southside refurbishment project.\nThe Union decided that it\ncouldn't afford to run a Summer Ball without significant financial support from the\nCollege. The College had\noffered to under-write the\nevent, but the Union insisted\nthat the College already owed\nthem the \u00a325,000 that was on\noffer. The dispute was later\nresolved by the Deputy Rector,\nProfessor Peter Bearman.\nThe Summer Ball was\nrevived a week later with a \u00a320,000 gift from the College to\nplug the projected financial\nshortfall. A desperate search\nwas undertaken by Union\nPresident, Sen Ganesh, to find\nstudents willing to take on the\ntask of planning the event.\nMany months of wrangling\nfinally came to a head with a five hour meeting of Union\nCouncil to ratify proposed\nchanges to the way that the\nUnion represents students to\nthe College. The required\nmajority was easily reached,\nwith David Francis (Deputy\nPresident for Education and\nWelfare) the only person who\nvoted against the new\nchanges being made.\nRumours of a new sabbatical\nposition were reported by\nFelix. The new position -Deputy President for External\nSites - would cover all Wye,\nSilwood and Medical campus-es. There were suggestions\nthat this might remove the\nneed for a sabbatical Medic\nPresident.\nyear review\nA company headed by the former Tory cabinet minister John\nSelwyn Gummer offered to\nupgrade the College's air conditioning system in an effort to\nhelp combat its chronic energy\nshortage problem.\nEarthcare Products was\nreported to have offered to provide an integrated cooling\nservice for \u00a3700,000 per year\nmore than the College currently pays.\nFebruary\nThe Higher Education Funding\nCouncil for England decided to\ncut next year's funding to the\nCollege despite the fact that\nthe results of this year's research assessment exercise -in which College achieved a score of 6.68 - were higher than\nlast year.\nThe cut was made because\nImperial improved less than\nother institutions nationally,\nand so was entitled to a smaller share of the same level of\navailable funds.\nThe Union was expected to\nfeel a knock-on effect, particularly as its finances were\nalready under pressure, while\nit was contractually obliged to\nincrease the salaries of the sabbatical officers by 8% as a result of an increase in the\nstandard PhD grant from the\nEngineering and Physical\nSciences Research Council.\nThe combined effect was\nexpected to result in cuts in\nfunding to clubs and societies,\nalthough the Union intended to\nmake up a large proportion of\nthe shortfall by improving the\nefficiency of its central admin-is t ration, including the scrapping of the Activities Card for\nsports clubs.\nA new writing challenge was\nlaunched by the College with\nthe aim of promoting good\nwriting by its students.\n'Writing the Future' was\ndesigned to enable undergraduates and postgraduates alike\n\n"

    "content": "news felix\nOverseas Student Applications Up\nThe number of undergraduate\napplications to British universities from Chinese students\nhas risen sharply in the last\nyear, according to official statistics released by the\nUniversities and Colleges\nAdmissions Service (UCAS).\nThe number of students\nfrom China wishing to study in\nthe UK has increased almost\nten-fold in the last three years,\nwith an increase in applications of 69% this year. These\nincreases may be connected\nwith the fact that students\nthat come to Britain to study\nfrom outside the European\nUnion pay much higher tuition\nfees than those from within it,\nand some believe that British\nuniversities may be intentionally attracting overseas students to help the funding crisis currently prevalent in the\ncountry's higher education\nsystem.\nWhile there have been widespread decreases in the number of students applying to\nBritish universities in the past\ncouple of years, mostly attributed to the abolition of grants\nand the introduction of tuition\nfees, applications have risen\nby 2% across the nation as a whole this year, with the\nbiggest increase occurring in\nScotland - at more than 5% -where fees have been abolished. In contrast, applications from under 21-year-olds\nin England rose by just 0.1%.\nA number of politicians have\nsuggested that this year's minute increases in application numbers has called into\nquestion the likelihood of the\ngovernment meeting its target\nof 50% of all those under 30\nexperiencing some form of\nhigher education by the year\n2010. Speaking to BBC News,\nThe Liberal Democrat's Education spokesman, Phil\nWillis, decried the target as\nnow \"little more than a pipe\ndream,\" but the Higher\nEducation Minister, Margaret\nHodge, defended the Blair\n'vision', citing that applications were now on the up after\nan initial downturn following\nthe introduction of fees in\n1998. She went on to say that\nwhile there had been only a0.1% increase in the number of\nunder 21-year-olds applying,\napplications by 18-30 year-olds had risen by 7.3%.\nMeanwhile, a report published by Universities UK\nreported that the basic infrastructure of the British Higher\nEducation system is in a state\nof disrepair. The report estimated that around \u00a310bn of\nfunding needs to be found to\nensure that the buildings\nowned by Higher Education\ninstitutions across the country\ncoming to the end of their\nintended lifespans remain safe\nand usable.\nThe following were awarded Colours this\nyear for service to the Union.\nHalf Colours\nMatthew J Smith\nPaul Wortley\nDan Lehmann\nRichard Roberts\nLouise Timms\nDavid Wembridge\nEllen Bazely-White\nDiana Anderson\nKevin Clemitshaw\nEleanor Haine\nJennifer Wood\nPriscilla Chow\nChris Liston\nJacki Wielkopolska\nDavid Tregidgo\nHelen Clubb\nRoy Gilbert\nPaul Hotton\nLia Davies\nChloe Bermudez\nAndrew Smith\nNnenna Onuba\nRavi Jain\nRupal Gala\nChris Powell\nIrfan Habib\nJohn Paul Clarke\nLorna Robinson\nMary Jane Poynor\nRosanna Jon\nAlexandra Archard\nAlisdair Wren\nNona Ahamat\nStuart Davis\nDemetrius Onoufriou\nFull Colours\nPatrick Hoar\nStuart McDermott\nEdward Brown\nAndrew Gallagher\nBurly Cumberland\nRonald Ng\nAnnalisa Massara\nAmy Elliott\nAlison Bostock\nChris Adams\nChirag Patel\nSamuel Sharpe\nJatil Damania\nBarry Edmonstone\nRobin Greenwood\nAndy Heeps\nMelody Williams\nPhilip Power\nMax Werner\nThomas Tibbits\nNikhil Joshi\nImran Sharaf\nAmardeep Chana\nChris Christofou\nAndrew Lawrie\nBenedict Gove\nAdam Hasen\nThofee Adamjee\nSteven Little\nNada Yousif\nAlex Liddle\nAmanda Saunders-Vest\nDaniel Rose\nEnrico Ferri\nOutstanding Service Awards\nHelen Arney\nOliver Pell\nRichard Tang\nShazia Munir\nGavin Daisley\nShovi Ghosh\nRuth Chappie\nTim Collins\nDan Thompson\nRamnath Ramanan\nJohn Donovan\nRuth Roberts\nUnion Fellowships\nAkira Kirton\nMustafa Arif\nUnion Distinguished Fellowships\nGus Paul\nDavid C.

    "content": "reviews film\nEditorial\n\"a film by Cedric Kahn\"\nQ. What happens when you cross a spider with a human?\nA. Don't be stupid! You can't cross with a scalar.\nSpider-man has broken virtually every box-office record. In the\nUS, it has had the biggest opening day ever, biggest single day\never, and biggest week ever. It has been the fastest film to $100\nmillion (in just three days) and it has been hugely successful\nsince. This should not however be your reason for seeing it. I like everybody else felt almost forced to see Titanic (1997) and\nthat turned out to be a three-hour long insult.\nSpider-man will overshadow everything else in the next couple of weeks but if you can, find Roberto Succo (pictured). Based\non the story of one of France's most notorious and vicious serial\nkillers, Succo stalked the south of France during the early eight-ies, randomly killing anybody that stood in his way. Cedric\nKahn's film is made in a documentary style that disturbs in its\nbrutal honesty. He presents the facts of the case without making any attempt to glamour is e the motives and actions of the\ncriminal in the same way other based-on-real-life movies like\nGoodfellas (1990) do. Succo is disturbing because he fits no\nstereotypes and, similar i ly, to Joe Pesci's Tommy DeVito is highly unpredictable and remorseless. The difference between\nTommy DeVito and Roberto Succo is that outside of being a psychopath Succo is one of us. To check where Roberto Succo or\nother films are being shown go to the website www.scoot.com.\nBack to Spider-man. You might have heard about all the continuity errors in the film. Despite all their efforts to digitally\nremove the twin towers from the skyline in the movie, there is\none instance in which they are visible. So Ron Fatkinson spot-ter's badge for anybody getting that. I shit you not.\nThis is the final Felix oi the year and I will no longer be editorial ising Film next year. In fact, I hope I won't be at Imperial\nnext year. So shout outs to the following: Cromwell firm, Physics\nfirm (they're 2rude2 B2ru), the r ml9 syndicate, the family, film\nreviewers, anybody who knows me. Special thanks to will who\ntook a gamble which I hope has paid off. So let's hear it for the\nmaster of ceremonies, MC Joka 2K2, because this is the end so\nI 'll finish like I started... Bam.\nDarius\nSpider-man\nin cinemas nationwide...now\nAt the screening I attended, the young boy sitting next to me\ncould hardly sit still as the opening credits rolled. And by the\nend of Sam Raimi's take on everyone's favourite human-ara ch nid, it was difficult to tell who had the biggest, stupidest grin\non his face, him or me.\nA stoic, chin-stroking seriousness is the normal demean our required of any self-respecting critic at these screenings, but\nfrom the moment a freshly bitten Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire)\nawakes to find himself the bemused owner of big biceps and\nrock-hard pecs, my Cheshire grin appeared. It barely faded for\nthe remainder of the film.\nI'm sure the story is familiar to you: boy gets bitten by genetically modified spider, boy finds himself in possession of fantastic superpowers, boy rids world of evil green bad die. But Raimi,\nalong with a fabulous leading cast, makes things far less black\nand white than that.\nA few people may have raised eyebrows at the choice of\nTobey Maguire, but his fraught, troubled take on Spidey fits so\nwell. From the amusing boyish delight Parker takes in his newfound abilities, to the final acceptance of his responsibilities,\nMaguire is spot on. So too is Willem Dafoe, as the truly unsettling bi-polar Norman Osborn, desperately clinging on to his\ncorporate empire, whilst battling to suppress his evil alter ego,\nthe Green Goblin.\nAfter initially being content to earn a few quid from backstreet wrestling he eventually becomes more responsible with\nhis powers, pulling babies from burning buildings etc.. But, at\nthe same time, he has to contend with a suspicious newspaper\nmagnate bad-mouthing his every move. And if that wasn't enough, he has his love, Mary Jane, stolen by his best friend.\nIn direct contrast to Episode 2, the story in Spider-man more\nthan holds up and provides an excellent setting for the lead\ncharacters to fight it out. It is this that sets the film apart from\nits contemporaries. The CGI-fuelled action sequences are exhilarating and there lots of laughs to be had, but the great characters and story make it all the more enjoyable.\nAdam Joyce\n\n"

    "content": "reviews music\nLIVE: DJ Shadow\n@ Astoria\nThere is no support band to precede one of the year's most\neagerly awaited performances by a DJ. There are only funky\ntunes to greet us before Shadow comes onstage with four\nturntables and various electronic boxes. Rarely seen live, he\nshows humbly his joy at being here, thanking his public for\nspending their time and money on him.\nBefore beginning his set, Shadow introduces a12 minute\nmovie directed by a friend, showing on a big screen in the middle of the stage. It shows the extraordinary meeting between\njazz drummers and hip-hop DJs from San Francisco, images\nwhich, at once, make us aware that rhythm is a major force\nbehind DJ Shadow's music.\nAlone, but surrounded by his array of machines, Shadow\ngives us an original show. It is aDJ set at face value, but the live\nversions of his tracks make it into a gig. Videos, shown behind\nhim, complement the music perfectly, from accelerated traffic on\nthe Golden Gate bridge to a visit to the record shop on the cover\nof his debut album Entroducing.\nBut by letting the camera do some of his work for him, DJ Shadow reveals that he is, to an extent, limited by the fact that\nhe plays alone. The excellent sound makes this barely notice-able, but I think that some more musicians would give him the\nchance to deliver a better performance. Confirmation of this\narrives when he plays one of his demos accompanied by a drummer. Here, we really begin to notice the abstract hip-hop\nthat is a real feature of his music.\nIn spite of the \"coldness\" that some of Shadow's detractors\naccuse his tracks of possessing, the man from UNKLE will\nalways be saved by his love of music - the jazz, the hip-hop -and his obsession with rhythm.\nAn almighty encore provides us with a glimpse inside the\nnew musical drawer in which DJ Shadow's future works are\nhidden: look out for some outstanding tracks with very very big\nbeats.\nDJ Shadow's new album The Private Press is out now on\nIsland I Mo Wax records.\nBBBB B Frangois\nOUT THIS WEEK\nALBUM THE D4 - 6Twenty LP SINGLES\nALPINE STARS - Carbon Kid\nATHLETE - You Got The Style\nAUBURN - Dreams\nBASEMENT J A XX Get Me Off\nCURVESIDE - Save Yourselves\nFANTASTIC SUPER FOOFS - Bilo Boss\nBEVERLEY KNIGHT - Gold\nMUSE - Dead Star / In Your World\nPARSLEY SOUND - Platonic Rate\nSingles\nRoundup\nALPINESTARS feat BRIAN MOLKO Carbon Kid I can't decide whether this record really needs Molko's voice,\nwhich I feel was purpose built for his own songs and absolutely nothing else. It matters little though, as the Alpinestars conjure up a pleasurable sounds cape in this brief big-beat number\nwhich bears more than a slight resemblance to early Chemical\nBrothers work.\nBBBB O Derek\nFROU FROU Breathe In\nThis is the new musical brainchild of Guy Sigsworth, who has\nworked with Madonna, Seal and even Bomb The Bass during\nhis (possibly) illustrious career. And this little ballad is actually\nsurprisingly easy to listen to, given the very soppy lyrics. Watch\nout for more from Frou Frou over the coming months, and if\nyou're feeling bored, check out their excellent website at\nwww.frou frou. net.\nBBBB O Derek\nOUT THIS SUMMER\nJust to whet your appetite, the following should appear in\nrecord shops over the next month or so. Current release dates\nare in brackets.\nALBUMS IDLEWILD - Remote Part (8 July)\nLAYO & BUSHWACKA - Night Works (1 July)\nMOR CHEE BA Charango (1 July)\nPAUL OAK ENFOLD Bunkka (24 June)\nOASIS - Heathen Chemistry (1 July)\nBETH ORTON - Daybreaker (15 July)\nTHE VINES - Highly Evolved (15 July)\nSINGLES\nDIRTY VEGAS Ghosts (22 July)\nTHE PRODIGY - Baby's Got A Temper (1 July)\n\n"

The sensors measure both vital signs and indicators of psychological state, such as sighs.\nThe data can be sent via the Internet to a doctor who can adjust medications\naccording to fluctuations.\nHowever, Nexan of Alpharetta, Georgia,\nhas invented smart monitoring without\nwiring clothes. Its sensors - which look\nlike an elaborately bent paper clip -adheres to a patient's chest and radios\ndata to a storage device up to fifteen\nmetres away. Electrodes in the sensor\nmeasure respiration and contraction of\nthe heart.\nThe interface between flesh and silicon\nis evolving quickly. I quote one of the\nvisionaries Mario Ferrari, who said, \"the\nchild is not born yet, but at least we have\nthe marriage.\"\nDavid Ross in the September 2001\nTechnology Review stated that every year\napproximately more than 50,000\nAmericans with diabetes must undergo\nfoot or leg amputations. In many of these\ncases, poor blood circulation is the villain.\nImagine, then, having socks with built-in\npressure sensors that would alert you to\nput your feet up for a while.\nSmart socks are just one example of the\ngrowing push to make high-tech home\nmedical devices a part of our everyday\nlives.\nWouldn't it be wonderful to have a personal futuristic jogging suit, like a second\nskin, with interfaces to the inside and the\noutside? From the outside your jogging\nsuit monitors the weather and terrain,\nwhile on the inside your bio-physiological\nstate is detected. The suit can analyze\nyour movement, and advise on the duration and intensity of the exercise, according to your personalized training pro-gram me, stored on a smart card. When\nyour suit 'notices' that you are getting\ntired, it can encourage you to go on, or it\ncan immediately adapt the training\nscheme for the next days, and if necessary make the 999 call to the doctor.\nMost of these first-generation gadgets\ngrab data on vital signs and then radio\nthe information back to a home health station or a receiver connected to the PC.\nNow physicians and engineers at a handful of universities and start-ups are pushing the technology even further. Their\ngoal is to harness new materials and\npowerful microelectronics to make\ndevices that are even more intelligent and\nself contained to make not only data\n11 IIH\nhi\u00abfM IS Mi*!!**\nMs#:ry si \u00bbiq f< ffc\n'LifeShirt'\nreporters but preventive aids that detect\ndangerous medical conditions.\nResearchers at Andersen Consulting's Centre for Strategic Technology Research\nare redefining the concept of 'personal'\ncomputing by bringing the Internet into\nthe bathroom with the Online Medicine\nCabinet (OMC).\nThe OM C is a computerized bathroom\ncabinet that greets you, checks your\nblood pressure, communicates with your\nhealth care provider and reminds you to\ntake your medicines on time. It combines\nspecial sensor technology, embedded\ncomputers and the Internet to create\nwhat Andersen calls a \"situated portal.\"\nThe OM C integrates technologies such as\nface recognition, voice synthesis, flat\npanel displays and smart labels. On\nentering the bathroom the computer in it i tt\nThe doctor can\npoke at the computer\nscreen with the\npointer and would feel in his finger that\nhe is actually touching it\nat esa dialogue by greeting the person\nthrough voice technology. Special sensors\ndetect when a medicine bottle is lifted out\nof the cabinet and when the supplies are\nrunning low. If a refill is required, the\nOM C generates an email request to the\npharmacy. And using smart labels, it\nwarns if you pick up the wrong medic a tion. Sounds too good to be true, but this\nkind of technology is available.\n2002 marks a decade of accomplishments in the field of interactive computer\nbased technology - virtual reality - for use\nin medicine.\nOne such example: nowadays when\ndoctors perform an abdominal examination on a patient, they have to rely on their\nhands to do much of the guesswork.\nTender livers, pea-sized tumors, and\nswollen spleens are often diagnosed this\nway, and followed up with high-resolution\nscans that take precise recordings of the\nsize and location of those bumps and\nlumps.\nA new virtual reality glove being developed by researchers at the State\nUniversity of New York at Buffalo promises to change that.\nThe information will be transmitted to\nthe second doctor through a haptic feedback device; a small, transportable robot\nthat fits on a user's hand like a thimble.\nThe robot allows a user to manipulate an\nimage on a computer screen and feel the\nphysical results of that virtual mani pula tion. The doctor can poke at the computer\nscreen with the pointer and would feel in\nhis finger that he is actually touching it.\nFuture health care delivery will rely on\nan aggressive, preventive model that is\nvastly different from the reactive, episodic\nmodel utilised today. Individuals will\nassume a more active role in their care.\nMedical systems, including home health\nsystems, will exhibit collective intelligence of individual devices.\nOne way or the other, our daily lives will\ndepend on computing at many levels.\nThis is just the beginning...\n\n"
