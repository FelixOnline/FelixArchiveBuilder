    "content": "- 2 \u2014 FELIX\nLord Mayors Show\nThe wet windy and cold November morning was not sufficient to deter about 50 Guildsmen (and women), from giving the President\na great send off in Bo from outside the Guilds\nEntrance. They then proceeded to Ludgate Hill\nonly to find waiting l for them a dozen or so\nof the toughest Blues in London. The Guildsmen were honoured by the reception comit-tee . . . the police were not amused.\nThe Blues' Inspector came and chatted to\nthe President and was heard to remark \"You\nplay ball w iv' me and I 'll play ball w iv' you.\"\nThe President explained that had the Guildsmen known beforehand of the City of London Police's interesting hobby they would\nhave brought along their ball of Putney fame.\nHe then added that if perhaps the Inspector\nhad any nuts he wanted tightened, the Guildsmen would be delightful to do the job for\nhim with the Spanner . . . The Inspector\nwas amused.\nWhilst waiting for the procession the\nGuildsmen entertained the crowd with a vast\nrepertoire of songs, every other being a Boomalaka, until the President was seen to wilt\nunder the strain, at which point the lads resorted to singing songs about Kings in the\nStrand . . . The crowd was amused . . . The\npolice were not amused . . .\nA quick whip-round the crowd produced\nenough to buy a few dozen poppies which\nwere diplomatically distributed among the\ncontributors; the few poppies left over were\nceremoniously presented to the Blues \u2022 . . The\nBlues were not amused . . .\nAmong their many \"appreciative\" comments on the parade, the Guildsmen sang\na complimentary song to an RAF officer on\none of floats about his being beautiful, to\nwhich he replied with a salute which started\nand ended at hip level . . The Guildsmen\nwere amused.\nSTUDENTS SURVEY A TI.C.A week ago last Monday every other malt\nand every female third year student in the\nCollege re ice veda copy of the qu asti on aire which the Students' Survey Unit is sending out\nas part of its Survey. The question aire is extremely comprehensive, inquiring into the stud-ent's background (e.g. parental income, parents'\nprofession, school attended, etc.), his religious\nand political outlook, the papers he reads\nand the type of job he intends to take.\nThe only other student surveys of this type\nhave been carried out at Oxford and Cambridge and it is hoped to obtain interesting\ncomparisons between London and Oxbridge\nstudents. The>>results of the survey will also\nbe submitted as a memorandum to the Robbin's Committee.\nThe survey* is organised by a group of\nstudents at L.S.E. and the results will be computed by Dr. Mark Abrams, a leading sociologist and managing director of Research\nServices.\nSECURITY OFFICER'S BULLETIN Jock Henry, the College Security Officer,\ninforms us that he has a considerable quantity of lost property in his office, including several College scarves, ladies' and gents' um-brel las, gloves, a cardigan and a cap. Jock is\nalways ready to help students who have lost\nanything and can save you considerable effort\nin your searching s. His office is just behind\nthe Messengers' Office in the Beit Building.\nFrom the last issue of King's News: \"The\nprocession was assisted on its way by some\nRugby players, including Kingismen, and these\nwere met with loud cheers on coming to the\nwaiting King's party . . . \"\nThere were no Kingsmen among the Rugby\nplayers (apparently it was too cold and wet\nfor them) and they were b oed heartily by the\nKing's spectators. So much for King's News.\nThe highlight of the procession for the\nGuildsmen was the Guilds rug ger team taking part in the float entitled \"Relaxation and\nRecreation\". Guilds was to have played against a Kings team, but apparently it was\ntoo wet and cold for Kings since they did\nnot turn up . . . the two Guildsmen playing\nstand-offs were disappointed . . . and having\nheard of Kings in the Strand, so were the\nBlues . . \u2022 The team scrum med down and the\ncombined Boomalaka which resounded was\nsufficient to completely drown the following\nband trying its best to dodge the shower of'\npennies lobbed at the euphonium. The Guildsmen lost the ball under the float, and the\npolice, quick to practise their hobby, soon\nretrieved it for them!\nAs the Lord Mayor's coach passed by, the\nSpanner was lifted aloft amidst cheers and\nsuch comments as \"And in this coach, Ladies\nand Gentlemen, we have the Lord Mayor . . .\"\nThe Lord Mayor laughed doffed his hat and\nwaved . . . Apparently the Lord Mayor was\namused.\nAfter the procession, Bo with the President\nand Spanner aboard, set off at walking pace (?)\nand was escorted by the Guildsmen as far as\nWestminster. The Spanner was shown to\nKings but throughout the morn j lng Reggie\nwas nowhere to be seen. The Guildsmen were\ndisappointed . . . the police were relieved.\nL. J.A.I. C. TAKEOVER PROPOSITION\nIN U.L. U. DEBATE Last Thursday, Nov. 16th, I.C. practically\ntook over the proposition in the University of\nLondon Union Debate, that in the opinion of\nthis house \"The message of Christianity is irrelevant to the XXth Century.\" Finlay McPherson was the opening guest speaker, Professor Emeritus Hyman Levy (who has been\nDean of R.C.S. and retired as head of the\nMaths. Dept. just over 3 years ago), was the\nprincipal speaker f of the ]mc*ion i. Donald\nPearson (who is also Chairman of the U.L. Humanist Society), Dick Lewis (President of\nthe I.C. Debating Society) and Mr. Siimwason all spoke from the floor. Brian Ford of\nthe I.C. Methodist Society was the only man\nfrom I.C. to oppose the motion, but though\nall I.C members waxed eloquent, the motion\nwas lost by almost 3:1.\nThe Debate was of a high standard and is\na good example of the activities at U.L. U. which are well worth attending.\nJOHN WHITE\nEXPEDITIONS1962 The Exploration Board will consider proposals for expeditions for the summer 1962 at\ntheir next meeting.

    "content": "FELIX\nAn IC Motor Club?\n6\nANIC WAR IAN LOOKS AT RUGBY Of all the esoteric pastimes, rugby (or\nperhaps one should give it its proper title of\nRugger), is the most unintelligible to the feminine mind. The mixture of schoolboy en-thus i as m, masochism and sheer brutality that\nconstitutes this purely male preserve, defies\ndescription, except possibly in purely Freudian terms. It would take the uninitiated a long\ntime to understand even the jar gt on, let alone\nthe philosophy of the game, that is, if there\nis any philosophy attached to it.\nThe first thing that strikes one is the complete disregard that the originators of the\ngame of the game had for the meaning of\nwords. In the game of rugby, there are two\ncentres, four three quarters, and the attack consists of the backs (who presumably fall upon\nthe opposition from behind), while the defence\nis made-up of forwards, who defend from an\nadvanced position, a philosophy of warfare\nthat would not, one thinks, have recommended itself to Napoleon. A centre, semantically speaking, should be in the middle, while\none would suppose three quarters to be three\nand not four in number, unless of course they\nshould be referred to as fs, which makes nonsense of halt backs, who are three quarters of\nthe way up the field for most of the game.\nOne, of course, refuses to accept the idea that\nthe half backs are not all there, or rather,\nonly half-there. In any. other case, this would\nbe taken for granted, but it seems necessary,\nto be very explicit when referring to rugby.\nAccording to the best authorities, a loose\nhead prop, is not a player with a dislocated\nvertebra, but the gentleman (!) who holds the\nhooker up, whilst he himself has his head\nfree. On the other hand, the head prop holds\ndown his position not, as one might think,\nbecause or his nightly communing s with the\ngod of wine, but because of his ability to\ntold up the hooker and, at the same time,\nto prevent his opponent in the opposite front\ntow <a loose head prop and not a tight\nhead prop, as one would, with justification,\ndeduce) from performing the same service for\nhis hooker. This leads, one must admit, to\nso in e confusion. One more ambiguity arises\nin the case of the lock forward, sometimes\nknown as the \"number eight\", although the\nnumber on his shirt is 14, but in South\nAfrica, apparently the lock forward plays in\nthe second row of the scrum. One can imagine some inexperienced lock forgetting that\nhe is, in fact, a number eight, and trying to\nplay in the back row, while his South Africar.\nteam-mate who plays lock when at home, is\ndesperately trying to find room for himself\nin the second row. That doesn't sound quite\nright, but any errors due to ignorance can\neasily be rectified by experience.\nNext, one must deal with the jargon, which\nis complex, confusing and, quite often, very\nsuggestive. Brutal is not nearly strong enough\nto describe the usual phrases which are uttered\nevery Saturady afternoon. Cries of \"Feet I Feet I Feet\\\" rend the air; \"Do that again\nand I 'll break your bloody neck.\" \"Stop biting my ear or I 'll fill you in\\\" and hundreds\nof other such terms which are in every true\nsportsman's vocabulary, are heard during all\nrugby matches and are quite audible on the\nhockey pitch next to the rugby f ii el d. But the most baffling bits of description usually go like this: \"We got the\nball against the head, and I broke on\nthe blind. 'Their wing forward was offside,\nfor a start, and then he attacked me after I'd passed to the fly half. What makes it worse,\nthe whistle had already gone, for foot-up, and'\nI was in touch anyway.\" What on earth does\nall that mean?\nAt present C.&G. has a Motor Club with\nthe very large membership of over 120, R.C.S. has a very small club of about 10 members,\nand R.S. M. at the time of writing has no\nMotor Club, but if certain plans are success-ful, it will have one within a fortnight.\nR.C.S. holds occasional meetings, but the\nresponse does not warrant further meetings\nonce i a fortnight. Some ot fi the activities of\nthese meetings are mentioned later.\nIf there were an I.C. Motor Club, the excellent facilities and organisation of Guilds'\nClub would be avil able to all the motor enthusiasts of I.C. The main objection to this is that some\npeople think that rivalry between the colleges\nover the upkeep of the motor mascots would\nbe lessened. Utter rubbish! Is the rivalry on\nMorphy Day between the College crews lessened because the! following week the I.C. crews will consist of members of all three col-leg es? Of course not! By all means have\nbranches of the i'I. C. Motor Club', existing\nin each College to maintain the College char-i ots. If anything, rivalry may be increased; it\ncertainly will not be lessened.\nWhat about it them, motor enthusiasts of\nI'.C. \u2014 the formation of an I.C. Motor Club?\nR.C.S. Motor Club.\nThe Club was formed in 1955, in order to\nkeep 'JEZ' in running order as a ceremonial\nchariot for the President of R.C.S. secondly\nto act as a Motor Club for enthusiasts.\n'JEZEBEL' (a1913 Dennis Fire Engine) was\npurchased in 1955 from J. Cornfields Ltd. of\nWarrington, the soap manufacturers. Perhaps\na load of free samples had been carried down\non her.\nThe Club is a member of the Historical\nCommercial Vehicles Club which holds rallies from time to time. At Basildon, in September 1960, 'JEZ' won a driving test trophy,\nthere being about 50 entrants in this class.\nEach year 'JEZ' goes to Beaulieu, although\nshe has not met with any success yet. She also\ngoes to Sjlverstone for the) veterans' racing\nI. \u20ac. Musical Society\nORCHESTRAL CONCERT\nMONDAY, NOVEMBER27 TH1961 at 6.00 p.m. in the PHYSICS COMMON ROOM\nPhysics Building to be followed by a BUN-FIGHT (musical evening)\nto which all musicians in the College\nare invited-Only two courses are open to the ICWArian. She can learn about the game, in which\ncase she'll probably find that men disgust her,\nor she can remain in blissful ignorance, and\nonly find out how horrible is the rugby-play-ing male, after she's married one. By that\ntime, it's too late anyhow. The best advice\non the subject is, probably, don't go out with\nrugby players. Stick to hockey players. Then,\nat least, you'll know what they're talking\nabout.\nP.H. rally and to Brighton, 'JEZ' is not eligible to\nenter for either of these, but goes along for\nthe fun of it.\nDuring term time, 'JEZ' has to be kept in\nrunning order, a few works visits are being\narranged, and a treasure hunt is also being\narranged for next term. Support in the form\nof mechanics, polishers (ladies of R.C.S., here is your chance to shine) and drivers (who\nmust be over 21) is urgently needed.\nC.&G. Motor Club.\nThis Club was formed essentially to cater\nfor everyone interested in motoring, whether\nhe be a novice or an enthusiast. It also maintains 'BOANERGES' in running order. The present 'BO' is a1902,2\\ litre James and Browne\nchariot; previously 'BO' was a1908 Rover,\nwhich, unfortunately, came to grief in 1928\nat the hands of some hooligans from Kings.\nThe Club holds meetings once a fortnight\non Fridays when, talks are given or films\nshown. The talks are often given by people\nof the motor industry, and by well-known personalities of the track. The Club is hoping to\nbe addressed by John Surtees and Eric Oliver\nthis year. One film which they are hoping to\nshow next term is the second part of 'The\nHeroic Days' and is entitled 'History of Rac\ning'. This is a new film and should prove fascinating to everyone who enjoys the thrills of\nthe race track. Visits to motor firms (Lotus.\nAston Martin) are made each year. Two rallies are organised each year, one of which\nwas held last Sunday and the other is due to\ntake place in the Spring term.\n'BO' enters that epic for veterans cars\nthe- London to Brighton Run and only\non two occasions since the war has she been\nunsuccessful!: once >he was not entered and\nthe other occasion was when he exceeded the\naverage speed limit of 20 m.p.h. The time taken this year was 4 hrs 40 mins.,\nthe only troubles being, slightly faulty navigation at one point, over-heating due to the\nnew plugs, and a tremble rc oil packing-up\ntemporarily so that she was running one cylinder only.\nm res entertainments production\nDEC ls lONE GUINEA\n\n"

We all believe that the Carnival should be directed\ntowards doing good to those most in need\nof it (and I wonder how many of those applauding so vigour ou sly twill actually take\nan active part?), and we also believe in the\nright of every man ta express his opinion at the\nUnion's expense. All we need now is for the\nUnion to join N.U.S.( that hardly annual in\nUnion politics) and thus save the students\nwho are going to save ten pounds on cheap\ntravel the expense of paying the fifteen shillings individual membership. Long live the\nCampaign for Celtic Freedom.\nThe CND debate left a number of impressions; the terrible weakness in organisation\nof CND's opponents, the scrupulous fairness\nand complete character less ness of Si Lyle's chairmanship, the quiet confidence, sureness\nand competence of Mr. Finch, the mob-ap-peal approach of Mr. Bond, and the impotent rage behind Mr. McPherson's neurotic\noutburst. On the whole a lively meeting,\nguaranteed to improve the ego of all those\npresent.\nLast year's secretary of the Union, Jim\nCarter, reports flying saucers, wit'i cups at-t ached, sailing past his window. Apparently\nNow Felix is crammed with news of de bagging sessions and Scrutiny is more than ever\na vehicle for propaganda, the first issue of\nPhoenix this term comes as a welcome breath\nof fresh air. Slimmer than usual, it is still\nwell worth buying. This issue is given a welcome degree of unity by John Munday's drawings which are used throughout, but the lay-out, also by John Munday is not quite so\ngood. The aim was obviously to make the\nlayout simple straight-forward and effective,\nbut the result tends to be pedestrian. However, it is satisfactory and devoid of useless\nfrills and gimmicks.\nRush's cartoons, of which there are four,\nare more mature both in subject and execution than most of his previous work, and help\ntowards the good balance of this issue.\nOne cannot compare the work of student\nwriters, especially students at an all-science\ncq lle ge, with the best professional writers,\nand naturally we do not except Phoenix to\ncome up to these standards, so your reviewer\nhopes that his remarks will be taken by the\nwriters as constructive rather than as a condemnation of them. The usual complaint\nmade about Phoenix is that while the writers\nare competent enough and produce occasional\nbrilliant patches, they cannot sustain them and\ntheir work seems uneven and unbalanced in\nquality. Tony Musgrave, whose \"Story\" stands\nabove the rest of this issue, is a good example\nof this. He is obviously an observant and a very sensitive writer, and his sensual, outwardly inconsequential tale invites comparison with\none of the c raz j residents of his establishment\n(no connection with any similarly named or-gan is ation) is suffering from Galloping Athlete Head. The usual sym p tons are a tendency to tie a cup and saucer on a long piece\nof string and then to race back and forth\nalong the highest flat roof you can find, dangling the i cup t anu-saucer assembly over the\nedge.\nThe sport machine in the Union gents\nhas proved an absolute boon to the scruffs\nof the Union. Subtle use of a bent sixpence\nhas led to the electric shaver's going full\nblast for the last few days, generously giving\nfree shaves to all and su dry. A complaint has been received from a hospital in West London about the men from\nI.C. who go to their nurses' hops. Apparently they are such callow youths that the nurses\ndon't know what to do with than and vice-versa, so could we please send some more\nmature men along. They omit to state whether\nthe desired maturity is to be physical or\nmental, so the beer-and-rug ger and the soc-i a list humanist fraternities had better send along a contingent each to ensure the nurses'\nsatisfaction.\nD.H. Lawrence's stories. But whereas Lawrence can sustain his vivid and daring phrasing and similes, Musgrave lapses occasionally\ninto ordinary and rather dull passages. Nevertheless, \"Story\" is an impressive, confident\nwork; the unconventional touches appear as\nan integral part of the texture and not merely\nas gimmicks, and the whole story has a promising sureness of touch about it.\nHoward Glover writes a more conventional short &\\a iy, \"Let's Forget If, with a rather\no on vet ional twist in the ending! The general\nimpression is one of comp een ce rather than\nbrilliance, for the story is well-balanced and\neffective and the atmosphere of the dirty cafe\nand the bored, frustrated youths in it is well\ncaptured, but one misses the virtuosity that\ndistinguishes \"Story\". John Graham is again\ncompetent, effective and brief and Emelyn\nJones writes an ingenious tale in a style that\nfalls between two stools; not deli brat ely and\nabsolutely pedestrian so as to turn the whole\nthing into a fable, and not quite colourful\nenough to keep up the interest all the time.\nMusgrave consolidates his position with\nsome mature and lively comments on the contemporary novel and its background and\nthere are also some poems which your reviewer is not competent to comment on, except to say that Alan Ablewhite's \"Priests\nin the Sun\" appears as the most successful.\nAn enjoyable issue, but could we have more\nof it next time?\n1\nt* DAVE WILBRAHAM\nDave first came to I.C. from Stockton-on Tees in 1957 to do Chemical Engineering. He\nrapidly got to grips with Union activities and\nbecame Hon. Jun. Treasurer of the the Film\nSociety. From this post he proceeded through\nthe ranks of Secretary and President of that\nsociety, being at the same time connected with\nthe Conservatives of the Union. Work-wise\nhe graduated after three years with a first\nand stayed on to do research on radiation heat transfer.\nIn the summer of 1960 Dave stood for\nChairman of the SGIC. but was defeated.\nThis turned out to be the luckiest event so\nfar in his college life since he then became\nconvenor of the proposed R.C. C.. Later he\nwas elected unopposed as the first Chairman\nof that Committee.\nHaving decided that research was, not the\neasy thing that he first thought it to be, he\ndecided that his Union (activities this year\nwould be severely curtailed, and with tv pica l efficiency he was elected on to Union Council as Guilds Rep. However the Wilbraham\npower complex came to bear once again and\nan hearing that the DeputifPresidency of\nU.L. U. was vacant he decided to stand. In\nspite of being the official underdog in the election he got in, \"probably,\" he &a\\d, \"be-cause I was less well-known and therefore\nless disliked.\"\nDave is a familiar half-a figure round the\nUnion and can frequently be seen in the bar.\nIt is rumoured that he only goes there because\nsomebody told him that beer was good for\nthe scalp. He appears to have his share of\nthe fair sex, but is never to be seen around\nI'.C. with a woman. This causes considerable\nspeculation: perhaps his girl-friends are all\nserve n foot monsters.\nDespite his official position in U.L. U. the\nmost important of all his activities is the captaincy of the B.2. rugby team. This is ex-Jim's or die I.C. Accidentals and includes four\nmembers of Council and last year's President\nand Secretary of the Union.\nI am sure that we all wish Dave success in\nhis job and hope that his supervisor continues\nunder the; delusion that he is having a big\nthink.\nFelix apologise s to Dave Wilbraham for its\nstatement that he was elected Vice-President\nof UL U. He is in fact Deputy President, *\nmuch more important position.\nPHCENIX\nBY OUR LITERARY CORRESPONDENT\n\n"

    "content": "- 4 FELIX\nh WtA to ih t[d j fb L Dear Sir,\nMr. Kubba's recent article in Scrutiny provided an interesting interpretation of \"moral-it y\" in the Arab-Israeli dispute. I shall be replying to this article in full in the next issue\nof Scrutiny; however, it is essential for the sake\nof honesty, that some of the more blatant factual inaccuracies be made known right now \u2014\nhence this letter to Felix.\n\u2022\nMr. Kubba said, \"since the war, as a result\nof American pressure, sympathy, etc.... all\nbarriers to immigration came down.\", and that\nthe maintain ance of these barriers \"is to the\ncredit of the British.\" The fact is that the\nBritish maintained these barriers right to the\nend of the mandate despite the cost, financial-ly, militarily, and to het reputation as a great\n\"liberal\" power. It is believed that ONE\nMILLION LIVES could have been saved had\nthere been no restrictions on Jewish immigration before, during and after the war.\nMr. Kubba states that \"Palestine was a land\nalready fully populated\" and that \"Arabs are\nthe rig h ful inhabitants of the country.\" The\nfacts are that in 1936 there were only about\n100,000 people in the whole of Palestine; today there are over 2\\ MILLION people, in Israel\nalone, which occupies a much smaller area.\nMoreover, nobody ever inhabited the swamps\nand deserts which now form over 90% of\nIsrael's land area. Most important of all, it\nshould be realised that Arabs are not the only\npeople in the Middle East, and that Jews,\nKurds, Vruze and others have as much right\nto independence as anyone else.\nMr. Kubba also spoke of a Jewish plan to\n\"eliminate\" the Arabs in Palestine and that\nthe Arabs did not wish to \"drive the Jews info the sea\". This is an outrageous lie. The facts\nshow that exactly the reverse was the case.\nBefore the Arab invasion every effort was\nmade by the Jewish leaders to live peacefully\nwith their neighbours (refer to any reliable\nsource of information). It was the Arabs who\nrejected the portion plan (which today the\\\nfind acceptable) and further more it was the\nArabs who favoured the Nazi-like process of\n\"elimination\"; to quote; This will be a war of\nextermination and a momentous massacre\nwhich will be spoken of like the Mongolian\nmassacres and the Crusades,\" said Azzam\nPasha, Secretary-General of the Arab League,\non the eve of the British departure.\nFinally, Mr. Kubba speaks of the misery of\nthe Arab refugees. This is a fact. The great\ntragedy and most contemptible aspect of Arab\n\"morality\" in the Middle East is that these\npoor unfortunate human beings are being deliberately kept in this state by their own\n\"brother\" as a weapon in the propaganda war\nagainst Israel. I have ample evidence to support this disgusting allegation.\nYours etc.,\nH. LEVITT\nFelix\nPub\nGuide\nby KEG\nNO. 3.\nTHE NAG'S HEAD\nThe Nag's Head in Kinnerton Street, off\nKnightsbridge, is one of the smallest pubs in.\nLondon. It retains it? old-world atmosphere\nwithout becoming artificial, unlike some other\npubs near I.C. The original bar has been extended by incorporating another room at the\nback, but it still retains its painted China\nbeer-pump handles. In the basement there is\nanother small bar with a squint into the upper bar. The main attraction of the lower bar\nis a large musical box, which plays a variety\nof Victorian pops, using large punched steel\ndiscs as records. Although the pub is a Benskin's( Ind Coope) hq use, it serves draught\nRed Barrel (Upper Bar) and Guiness (Lower\nBar). Kinnerton Street is the first turning on\nthe left down Wilton Place, which is off the\nsouth side of Knigjhtsbridge, 300 yards east\nof Sloane Street.\nDear Sir,\nI never realised when I came here that\nwould be such a large number of men and s uc a small number of women, and I would like\ntake this opportunity to give the fam a levi point on the seemingly interminable war o the sexes which may nod but never sleeps\nIn the first place, most men at I.C.d is pla a remarkable lack of common politeness w they come across an ICWArian. To open a door for a young lady is usual practice in\npolite society, but it doesn't happen here\nFrom this I can only infer that common po\nit e ness is unknown to the men here.\nSecondly, who on earth told these d run sots that they are the answer to the mai de prayer! They assume that an unshaven, lo\nmouthed, rugby player is the dream of eve\nICWArian. Their attitude can be summed u as follows; \"I play rugby. I drink beer. I a a good chap, so all my bar friends tell me.\nTherefore, any young ICWArian will be\nthrilled to 'death if I offer her one or two bee\nembraces. Let's go I\" Saturday evening is\nterrible night, for us anyhow.\nThird, and last, why do they always loo\nat us as though we had fu st crawled out r& the gutter. None of us I'm sure, think of ou\nselves as potential Helens, but are we that bI think not. It's very difficult for us at this\nCollege, and the attitude of the men here\ndoesn't make it any easier.

    "content": "FELIX NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION NO. 168 FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 24TH1961 PRICE 4D I.C.C. N.D. RETURNS TRIUMPHANT\nAt the first I.C. Union meeting this term on\nNov. 16th, a motion \"that I.C.C. N.D. be reinstated for with\" was passed by a very large\nmajority. This reverses Council's decision at\nthe end of last term to disband the College\nC. ND. Group.\nThe Concert Hall was packed by 1.15 and\nreplying on the equation capacity = quorum, the\nExecutive decided that the meeting was quo-rate. l.C. Secretary Martin Staccy read the\nminutes and they approved in the usual manlier (i.e., with the house shouting \"No\\\") and\nDr. Weale dealt thoroughly and briefly with\nthe accounts.\nThe first motion before the house was that\nthe proceeds of this year's Carnival be devoted\nto some local charity: the charity suggested\nwas a local boy's club. Mr. Madison, proposing the motion made a brief and convincing\nspeech and so did his second er, Jon Bareford\nwho is this year's Carnival Organiser, but\nneither was a match for Dan Elwyn Jones,\nwho leapt onto platform and made a passion-ate and very strong case for the Algerian refugees in particular and refugees and starving\ncommunities in general, proposing that the\nproceeds go to War on Want rather than the\nlocal charity. After a few more speeches from\nthe floor I.C. President Si Lyle rightly ignored\nstrict procedure (there were in fact two motions on the floor) and asked the house to decide between the local charity and War on\nWant. The result was overwhelmingly in favour of War on Want: we hope that the Union,\nhaving told the Carnival Committee which\ncharity to support, will give them every assist-ance in their difficult task.\nBv now it was two o 'clock and the eager lv awaited I.C.C. N.D. motion came on to the\nfloor. It was proposed b v Bob Finch in arch nothing short of brilliant and by far\nbest of the meeting. He managed to cover\nmost of the relevant points in a short time,\nto make an extremely strong ease for C. N.D., to deal wittily and effectively with heckling,\nand to create a good impression with his aud-ien ce. In the past Mr. Finch has had the reputation of making long, dry and humour-less speeches and this one was a considerable improvement. After this broadside\nBrian Bond, S. CC. Chairman, made a brief\nand effective speech, consolidating the proposition's case, which could be summarised as:\ni. The rule-breaking did not justify\nICCND's disband ment. ii. The Group as a body had not supported\nthe Committe of 100.\niii. They fulfilled the concept of an I.C. Society as much as any of the other polit-ical, ethical and religious societies .\nThis completely refuted Council's published case for disbanding CND and proved\nto be unanswerable.\nThe opposition was pit ful by comparison.\nOne gentleman spoke from the floor for what\nseemed to be a very long time to abs u let ely no effect and R. CS President Finlay McPherson made a speech that was a masterpiece of passionate rhetoric and little else. The\nonly point that he made, that ICCND was a Campaign and therefore not a proper society\nhad been dealt with by Bob Finch very effect-iv ely, and Finlay's demagogues quo style compared un fo uv or ably with Finch's cool reason,\ning. The vote was practically unanimously\nin favour of reinstating ICCND and the result\nwas received with acclamation. The newly-authorised Chairman of ICCND, Frank Fuchs,\nleft immediately, grinning all over his face\nto claim the ICCND notice-board heading\nfrom the Union Office where it had eben languishing during their suspension.\nThe only other business dealt with was the\nSwimming Grla at UL U which was an-noun ced, and the question of mascots-bearers\non this occasion. Nominations were put forward hastily as the quorum disappeared rapidly out the door.\nThe standard of speaking at this meeting\nwas unusually high and most speakers seemed\nto have grasped that time was at a premium\nand made their speeches short. The a bsc en ce of the usual bickering about procedure was\nalso appreciated and made the Chairman's job\na good deal easier. This was an unusually\npleasant and fruitful Union meeting, far better than the procedure-bound slang ing matches\nthat we sometimes have to endure.\nEXTENSIONS TO GARDEN HALL\nThe Rector has announced his plans for\nsome of the miscellaneous property around\nthe College. The most interesting;, from the\nstudents' point of view is that Garden Hall\nis to be extended into the 4th and possibly\nthe 3rd floors of nos. 10 to 11 Prince's1 Gardens. This should be accomplished by the next\nsession.\nOtherwise only minor allocation changes\nare envisaged for nos- 10 to 14 Prince's Gardens, and demolition work on nos. 1 to 7 to\nmake room for the Sports Centre will start\nnext January. Building work on the Sports\nCentre is planned to begin in May 1962.\nThe Lyon Playfair Library, at present over\nAyrton Hall, will move into no. 180 Queen's Gate in March and demolition of the Ayrton\nHall block will start at Easter. The Staff Refectories and Dept of History of Science and\nTechnology will also be moved into no. 180.\nThe most VITAL Politician\nvisiting I.C. this term\nLord ALEXANDER\nof HILLSBOROUGH\n(Leader of the Socialist Party in the Lords)\nHear him speak at\nGENERAL STUDIES\nnext Tuesday.

He is the Editor of \"Prism\" and the\nowner of \"Time and Tide\".\nHis speech was the culmination of yet another successful annual dinner at which were\npresent some 110 people, including students\nfrom Imperial College and the other colleges\nin West London area of the University of\nlondon Church Society. His anger, he ex-plaine d, was due to the inefficiency which he\nsaw in the Church today both in the util is ation of manpower and money, and he suggested reforms which he would like to see\nbrought about.\nThe Chairman of the I.C.

Cup was avenged at Harlington\non November 8th when we reversed last year's result with our usual 1-0 win It is remarkable\nthing, but out of our seven wins to date five\nhave been by the) only goal of the match,\nunfortunately the Cup Match was no credit\nto anyone, except in the very good spirit which\nprevailed throughout. Panesar scored our goal\nmidway through the first half after IC. had\nlooked like scoring on several occasions, and\nthen the game deteriorated into a dour struggle with the defences holding out admirably,\nbut with no constructive attacks from either\nside. In a friendly match the following week\nwe again beat King's by the only goal.\nIn the second round of the Cup we meet\nQ.M. C, and should we bo successful our opponents in the semi-final will be Battersea or\nL.S.E., perhaps the biggest danger in the com-t it ion. Our latest success has been a22 draw with\nStaines, who had previously beaten the University, and we felt the result was most satis-factory. The game was the most exciting\nand against the best opposition that we have\nencountered this season. I.C. were on top for\nthe first ten minutes and Panesar put us ahead with a fine opportunist's goal. However,\nStaines took control after that and scored twice\nbefore the interval. The second half was very\ntense, with good hockey coming from both\nsides, and towards the end I.C. had the edge\nand drew level ten minutes from the end\nwith fine goal from Panesar.\nThe first XI's record reads:\nP WDL FA9720165 TPBOXING CLUB\nThe Boxing Club nas resumed its training sessions for the season.

The speakers were:\nFor:\nMr. John Cox and Mr. Combes\nAgainst:\nMr. Assist Chandmal and Mr. George Turner.\nJohn Cox gave an outline of the Communist idea of Communism \u2014 a striving for a materialistic Utopia, and used this as a basis\nfor his contention that \"17 is better to be Red\nthen Dead\". He thought that the main argument against the motion would be that under\na Red regime one's personal 'freedom\" would\nbe curtailed. He attempted to refute this by\nquoting the Cuban situation; viz. that it would\neb better to be free to choose one's job and\nthus be able to obtain the necessities of life,\nthan to be free to say what one liked (and\nin all probability, starve). The pitfalls of this\nargue ment are obvious.\nThe opposition produced two themes against the motion. The first was concerned\nwith the impossibility of living in a society\nwhich various atrocities were committed (such\nas the purges in the 1930's \u00bb and the second\nwas on the question of \"freedom\". George\nTurner compared an advanced (Communist\nsociety with those in \"1984\" and \"Brave New\nWorld\" and stated ;\nn essence that he would\nrather be dead than a conditioned Red. Incidentally George Orwell's concept of Russian\nSociety had beet n refuted by Mr. Combes but\nwith little qualification.\nThere were again some m telling ent speeches\nfrom the floor and when the motion was put\nto vote it was carried by a majority of two.\nThe voting was as follows: 52 for, 50 against,\nand 16 abstentions.\nOn the whole it was a good debate, there\nbeing a good balance between the serious\nand the humourous.
