    "content": "Forgotten by society, ignored by politicians, threatened by greater violence, the prostitute is out in the cold. What are we doing to help? Matthew Johnson invest ig Can't buy me love\nProstitute, whore, harlot, hustler, hooker, mere trix, courtesan, woman of pleasure, fallen woman,\nworking girl, call girl; she may not have a prestigious\nprofession, but she definitely has the oldest. No\nmatter what century or. which country you look at,\nyou will find women selling sex. From Mary\nMagdelane to Cynthia Payne, history is full of\nexamples. In Victorian London, it is thought that there\nwas one prostitute for every three men, quite a contrast to the prevailing public morals! But just as\nthe question is universal, the diversity of our reactions\nis equally broad. In some countries prostitutes are free\nto carry on their trade in peace, in others they can pay\nwith their lives. We cannot look at this in isolation.\nSex, money and marriage; the issues lie just too close\nto home.\nWho are the victims of this trade? Is it the prostitute\nwho values her body at the level of a simple\ncommodity? Or possibly the client, who, so frustrated\nby a lack of sexual fulfilment, is forced to such\ndesperate measures? Maybe even the whole of\nsociety is degraded, its structure and morals\nthreatened?\nPolicing\nAlthough payment for sexual intercourse is not itself\nillegal, the whole range of legislation (see box l, makes\nit very difficult for a prostitute to stay on the right side\nof the law. This makes her much more vulnerable to\ncriminal exploitation, and generally renders her safety\nin doubt.\nThe effect of the Street Offences Act, 1959 is to\ngive the police draconian powers in their treatment\nof prostitutes. It is not necessary for a prostitute to\nactually tout for trade to be arrested. It is enough for\nher simply to be seen loitering in an area, where a constable suspects her to be for the purpose of\nprostitution. Any woman who becomes known to the\npolice can easily be victimised, for when such a case\ncomes to court, it will simply be her word against that\nof the police. It literally gives a mandate to the police\nto arrest her as often as they please.\nMore recently, with the introduction of the Sexual\nOffences Act, 1985, the emphasis has at least started\nto move in the opposite direction. The police have\nbeen tar getting the clients as well as the women. The\nbill now going through Parliament, is intended to\nfurther tighten this legislation.\nThe police, however, have already developed a fairly effective way of dealing with the clients. Rather\nthan push them through the legal system (which they\ndo on occasions), they use a joint method of formal\nwarning and the sending of letters to their homes.\nIt is accepted by the police though, that the long\nterm effects of such action is fairly minimal. When\nthere has been a blitz on one area, the result has been\nthat the trade has simply re-established itself in a neighbouring area. Overall the legislation has been\naimed at reducing the nuisance to the public, but\nwithout tackling the problem at source, these\nmeasures have only had minimal success.\nThe Government is supporting the new Sexual\nOffences Bill to s teng then the 1985 act on ker b crawling, and so it is likely to become law in the near\nfuture. Apart from this, there is no other action either\nplanned or discussed by the Government. Not only\nthat, none of the major political parties has a policy\neither. Prostitution is clearly a difficult issue for any\npolitician to enter into, (sexual matters normally end\nin resignations, not in increased popularity!) At the\nmoment the law forces prostitutes into a dangerous\nunderworld, and affords them little protection. As far\nas these women are concerned, nobody in power\nseems to care one iota.\nafforded few rights. However, the injustices do not\nfinish there. Once charged with the offence of\nsoliciting, a woman is attributed the legal title of\ncommon prostitute. This is a label that sticks for life,\nand can be brought up at any time, and for any charge.\nIf you have raped someone, committed gre vio us bodily harm, or even murdered, then your conviction\ncannot be mentioned for fear of prejudice. If you have\nfor the money. The financial climate is an integral part\nof the problem. When Mrs Thatcher came to power\nin 1979, she pledged to lower taxes in order to\nencourage enterprise. Moving into the twelfth year of\nher government, many people are starting to reexamine the basis of her approach. A low tax\neconomy may be effective in germinating new\nbusiness, but the stark reality is that less of the\nLife on the Game\nClearly the decision to enter into prostitution is not\nan easy one. So what is it that makes a woman decide\nto go on the game? The major incentive is of course\nmoney. Charging an average of \u00a3 1 0 to \u00a315 per client,\nit is possible to earn considerably more than a common nine-to-five job. Working hours are often\nmore flexible, and in general shorter. This can be of\na significant help to single mothers, who are more free\nto arrange their work around child-care arrangements.\nBut this is really where the advantages cease. Going\non the Game, is akin to becoming a second class\ncitizen. The powers afforded to the police almost give\nthem the right to arrest her on sight. She could be\ngoing to do her weekly shopping, and still be arrested\nfor soliciting. These cases can and do occur. The\nprostitute is thrust into a criminal underclass, and\nbeen convicted of soliciting then you are a common\nprostitute, and must prove your innocence.\nPerhaps even worse is the treatment prostitutes\nreceive from society in general. People often value\nthemselves by the work that they do. The prostitute\ndoes not have this luxury. If she is asked what she\ndoes in life, she must lie or risk immediate\ncondemnation. This secrecy becomes a common\nfeature of her life. What does she do when her\nboyfriend (or girlfriend) asks the same question? If she\nhas children, then she risks having them taken into\ncare, being marked as an 'unfit mother'. She does not\nlose basic needs, they just become harder to fulfil.\nPoverty\nProstitution, however, is not simply a social issue. As\nwe have seen this difficult life is often only taken up\ncountry's wealth is spent on public services: hospitals,\nschools, disabled people, single mothers. The gap\nbetween the rich and poor gets even larger, and more\nwomen are forced onto the game. Of course not all\nwomen choose this option, but for those close to the\npoverty line, the incentives can be great. It is no\ncoincidence that recent increases in prostitution have\ncoincided with declines in state benefits. With the\nfreezing of child benefits, the pressures on single\nmothers are particularly bad.\nIt is an amusing reflection that these women have\ntaken the name of 'Thatcher's Girls'. Perhaps the\ngreat lady should be proud of the initiative that these\nwomen have shown in exploiting such a strong and\nlucrative market.\nSex in Society\nAt first it might seem difficult to decide why our\ntreatment of prostitutes is so bad, but when viewed\nin the wider context of general perceptions, the\nproblem becomes a little clearer. Judeo-Christian\nsociety has always had a discrepancy between its\ntreatment of men and women. From the mention in\nthe old testament, of wife amongst oxen and sheep,\nto the glorification of the Virgin Mary, un sullied by\nsexual experience, justice for women has been hard\nto come by.\nBritain in particular is known in Europe for its puritan\nattitudes. Sexuality is never an easy topic, but the\nBritish seem to be more paranoid than most. Sex is\ndirty and sinful, and only to be sanctioned under the\nneed for procreation (and then only within the safe\nwalls of matrimony). Our language is still strewn with\nsuch references: dirty magazine, dirty joke, dirty old\nman (almost as if old men had less right to sexuality\nthan younger men). With the decline of Christianity,\nand the growth of secular society, these values are\non the wain, but it would be naive in the extreme to\nbelieve we have already outgrown them.\nHistorically, the onus for limiting sexual intercourse\nTHE LAW\nSexual Offences Act, 1956\n\u2022 Illegal to encourage someone to be a prostitute\n\u2022 Illegal for man or woman to control or\ndirect prostitution, or to gain financially\nfrom it.\n\u2022 Illegal for a man to persistently solicit\na prostitute in a public place.\n\u2022 Illegal for anybody to be involved in the\nrunning of a brothel, or for a tenant or\nlandlord, to allow their premises to be\nused as such.\nStreet Offences Act, 1959\n\u2022 Illegal for a prostitute to loiter or solicit\nin a public place for the purpose of\nprostitution.\nSexual Offences Act, 1985\n\u2022 Illegal for a man to persistently solicit\na woman for the purposes of prostitution,\nfrom a motor vehicle (ker b crawl).\nAt the moment there is a bill for amending\nthe Sexual Offices Act, 1985. It will make\nit an offence for a man to solicit from a motor vehicle on any occasion, and not\nonly when he had been doing so\npersistently.\nIt should be noted that there is no law\nagainst the payment for sexual\nintercourse.\n\n"

The increase represents\n\u00a33000 onto Network's current \u00a315,000 budget.\nMr Eric Stables, the editor of Network, said that\n4000 copies of the magazine were produced every\nmonth. Mr Stables told Felix that he did not know\nthe figure for last year's Network budget, but he said\nthat far less than \u00a315,000 was used. He said that there\nwere 'no plans to use that amount'. Mr Stables said\nthat there were plans to start advertising in Network\n'to stabilize the financial situation'.\nLast year, Felix was budgeted for \u00a312,167. The\nproposed increase is 12.9% to \u00a313,734 for next year.\nThe College's budget also proposes an increase of\n12.5% from \u00a332,000 to \u00a336,000 for the HUB office.\nLady Clare Ash, who co-ordinates HUB, said that\nshe 'didn't know what the figures are based on.' 'I think someone has made a mistake.. I would be much\namazed if we spent half of that,' she said 'Most of\nwhat we do pays for itself,' she added\nUniversity\nslammed\nA recent report in the 'Daily Telegraph' has claimed\nthat the University of London is on the verge of\ndisintegration. The report says that the more powerful\ncolleges in the University are being slowed down by\nthe cumbersome bureaucracy of the system and are\nmaking overtures to leave.\nIn the report Sir Eric Ash, Rector of Imperial\nCollege, made a statement condemning the centralised\nadministration of the University. He also said that the\nUniversity does not have the status its talent deserves.\nThe report concluded that the future for the\nfederation of London Colleges looks grim.\nDisrupting\nmeeting\nImperial College Manufacturing, Science and Finance\ntrade union (ICMSF) will discuss the possibility of\n'disruptive action,' at its branch meeting on the 23rd May. The talks are in response to a dispute with\nCollege authorities over redundancies.\nThree members of staff have been given severe n ce terms for compulsory redundancies from the recently\nbought company 'Imperial Biotechnology Ltd'.(See\nFelix 865, 21 March and Felix 858, 9 February).\nMs Susan Sharp, ICMSF Branch Secretary, claimed\nthat all other alternatives had been turned down by\nthe college, and that the MSF 'reject that it is\nunreasonable to accept alterations..none of which are\nof significant cost considering college resources.' She\nsaid that it 'was likely' that the members of the ICMSF\nwould agree to disruptive action starting from any time\nafter the meeting on the 23rd May. The action would\naffect examinations and conferences.\nPage 2\nUnion\nfunds cut\nImperial College Union will get \u00a310,000 less than it\nasked for from the college next year. Dave Williams,\nICU Deputy President, said he was unsure of the exact\nfigures but told Felix that ICU had asked for \u00a3452,026\nnext year, a9.5% increase on the \u00a3412,900 it was\ngiven last year.\nHe said that the college will probably grant a6.2% increase, or a shortfall of \u00a310,000. He said that this\nwas because the college thought the \u00a3100,000 surplus\nthat ICU had accumulated 'looks bad'. \"Through good\nhousekeeping we have accrued the reserve\u2014let's spend it on students,' he said, and added that the\nsurplus was to 'be spent on specific projects' like\nrefitting the Union Dining Hall. The money will also\ngo towards writing off half the snack bar debt.\nHe said 'they will force on us or make us accept\nthe position to reduce the surplus'. The shortfall will\neither be taken out of the surplus or from the union\nclubs.\nMalcolm Aldridge, IC Senior Assistant Finance\nOfficer, said the college was facing a very large deficit\nnext year and savings had to be made. He said that\nthe union's surplus was 'roughly 25 %' of their grant.\n'We have not \"instructed\" the union to withdraw its\nreserve.. I am extremely careful not to tell the union\nhow to run itself, he said, 'It's up to them if they\nrun down their reserves or find other ways of\neco nom ising.' He was asked why the college was\nunder such financial constraints. 'It boils down to\nGovernment's funding of higher education not keeping\nup to the pay demands of academic and other staff,\nhe said.\nHay fever\nstudy\nHay fever sufferers are in demand from the Centre\nof Environmental Technology.

IC Party\nsecond\nThe Imperial College Party (ICP) came second after\nthe Conservative Party in the Local Council Elections\nin the Knightsbridge ward of Westminster. Dr PJ Finley, warden of Beit Hall and ICP candidate attained\n420 votes, compared to 852 for the next highest,\nConservative, candidate. It is estimated that 60% of\nthe students in the ward took part in the election.\nIn the Courtfield Ward, the ICP came 7th after the\nConservative party which gained 2595 votes between\n3 candidates. Ken Young (ICP) got 279 votes and\nPaula Young got 254 votes. This means that probably\n280 students voted out of 520 in the ward.\nDr Finley told Felix: 'By god, we scared the pants\noff them'.

    "content": "fell on the woman. It has always been she who reaps\nthe penal i ties of unwanted pregnancy. Her lover can\neasily desert her, and has traditionally done just that.\nWith modern means of contraception, such dangers\nhave all but been eliminated. The more recent risks\nof sexual transmitted diseases (STDs), and particularly\nAIDS fall on both man and woman. The imprint of\nthose older influences, however, remains strong.\nConsider for example, the overwhelming positive\nimage of a male sexual conquistador, a Don Juan or\nRudolf Valentino. Contrast that with the\ncorresponding female image; a woman who goes to\nbed with many men. She is nothing but a slag and an\neasy lay. When young men were told to go and 'sow\ntheir wild oats', their female counterparts were told\nto save themselves for marriage.\nThese gender sex roles are clearly distorted and\nunjust, both to men and to women. But much as we\nwould like otherwise they still prevail. It is for men to\na very positive role in educating their clients to the\npossible dangers.\nHillary Kinnel (Central Birmingham Health\nAuthority), 'We have found that working and former\nprostitutes to be the most effective communicators.\nThe clients tell us that they learn about HIV from the\nprostitutes themselves. If Health Authorities can find\nways of making resources available, prostitute\nwomen should be enabled to educate and deliver\nservices themselves, and not only to their clients.\nThey have a great deal to teach us all about the true\nsexuality of the society we live in.'\nThe next consideration is, if prostitution were de-criminal is ed, would it be beneficial to enforce a registration scheme similar to that in place in\nGermany, making health checks compulsory on a regular basis? The question might well be decided on\npolitical expediency rather than practical issues. It\ncould be difficult to be seen relaxing laws on\nothers. This is a commendable cause, and should be\nencouraged. That young girls have been persistently\npropositioned, simply because they have been in an\narea frequented by prostitutes, is worrying indeed.\nThis among other problems must be tackled. However\nwe have to be clear of exactly what our aims are.\nAlthough Christianity is now a minority religion, its\ninfluence is still strong. Prostitution goes against such\nteaching, and some people would be pleased if it were\nbanned outright. Many more feel uneasy, and would\nfavour legislation to discourage it, but we must\nconsider such arguments carefully. We also have a large Moslem community who would discourage the\nconsumption of alcohol, does this mean that we\nshould consider banning that?\nWhere the actions of some citizens infringe upon\nthe freedoms of others, then we must act to protect\nthose affected, that is the purpose of the law, but\nwhen those actions take place in private, between\nlust, and women to choose. When a prostitute goes\non the street and offers herself for sex in return for\nmoney, all she is doing is exploiting this situation. It\nwould be pleasant if the sexual needs of all people\nwere catered for within respectful and loving\nrelationships. The realities are that this will never be\nthe case either for men or for women.\nSex Education\nSince the discovery of AIDS in the 1980s, we have\nbecome aware of a new danger in sexual relations.\nThis issue though, must be treated with care, as we\nhave already seen how it can be used as a stick to\nbeat an already oppressed minority. Despite much\nevidence to the contrary, AIDS has been labelled as\nthe gay plague, revenge from God on the unholy;\nregardless of the fact that in Africa the primary\ntransmission method has been heterosexual sex.\nThere has been no evidence to suggest that the\ndegree of HIV infection is any higher among\nprostitutes than among the general population. The\nstatistics supplied by the Department of Health, show\nthat the number of cases of HIV infection attributable\nto heterosexual transmission in Britain stood at 167\nin September 1989 (including partners of bisexual\nmen, and intravenous drug users). Clearly having more\nsexual partners increases the risk of catching the\nvirus, however wearing a condom during sex\nsubstantially reduces them. The material of which the\ncondom is made is imp re me able to the virus, and\nproviding that it stays in place during intercourse\nwithout breaking, then the chances of passing on the\nvirus are negligible. Many prostitutes use condoms,\nand, in addition, they are more than usually skilled in\ntheir use. In fact it has been observed that far from\nbeing a danger to public health, prostitutes can have\nPage 12\nprostitution, without applying some counteracting\nrestraints.\nIf we look at the practical criteria, the evidence\nweighs against it. Where drop-in clinics have been\nopened, such as the Praed Street Project connected\nto St Mary's Hospital, the response has been\nexcellent. Legislation is more likely to be effective in\ndissuading women from coming forward than\nencouraging it. Those not willing to be registered by\nthe State as prostitutes, would be even less likely to\ncome forward.\nDr Sophie Day (St Mary's Hospital), 'Licensing will\ncreate a two tier system.' This indeed has been found\nin places where licensing has been applied.\nWe should also consider for whose benefit such\nmeasures are taken. It has been shown that the\nchances of male to female transmission, are much\nhigher than female to male transmission. Thus not\nonly are the women much more at risk of the disease,\nthey also have a much lower chance of passing it on.\nThe medical evidence is clear, people don't die from\nAIDS by having sex or from injecting drugs. They die\nthrough ignorance of the dangers and ways to avoid\nthem. The advantages of de-criminal is ation would be\nthat, without the fears of prosecution and police\nharassment, more prostitutes would come forward for\nmedical help, and would receive necessary advice.\nThis is adequately summarised by a comment from\nDr Helen Ward (Royal Infirmary, Glasgow).\n'The definite advantages of de-criminal is ation far\noutweigh any possible disadvantages.'\nThoughts for the Future\nNobody pretends that it is possible to legislate\nprostitution out of existence. The stated aim of\nexisting laws has been to reduce the nuisance to\n***mm i mm \u00ab~.. '-' Mas\nconsenting adults, then they must be left in peace.\nAt the end of the twentieth century, we are well past\nthe time when the state s hold be meddling in the moral\nbehaviour of its citizens.\nThe legislation so far has been ineffective in two\nmajor regards. Firstly, it has largely failed to remove\nthe nuisance of prostitution from the streets,\nmanaging to keep it moving from area to area.\nSecondly, it has substantially degraded and\nendangered the life of the prostitute, forcing her into\nan already overburdened legal system. The obvious\nsolution would seem to be to repeal the section of the\nSexual Offences Act 1956, referring to the keeping\nof a brothel. The prostitutes would then be able to\ncarry on their trade in private. This would not only\nremove the need for women to walk the street, and\nso remove the nuisance of ker b crawling, but would\nallow these women to carry on their lives without\ncoming into continual conflict with the law.\nIt would be a courageous government indeed that\ndared to take this step. Puritanism retains a firm grip\non public morality, and the moral backlash might be\nsevere. However, there are some very compelling\nreasons why we should risk such a reaction. Firstly,\nit might eventually succeed in removing prostitution\nfrom the street, freeing both police and the courts to\nget on with something much more useful. Secondly,\nit would free an already oppressed minority. Finally\nand perhaps most importantly, it would promote\nbetter health practices amongst prostitutes, far\noutweighing the problem of any possible increase. So\nfar, large government health campaigns have only\nbeen marginally effective in increasing awareness.\nPerhaps prostitutes could succeed where the ad\nagencies have failed?\n\n"

    "content": "FeliX Prostitution\nI found myself surprised and disturbed by this week's feature on prostitution. On the surface, I was most\nshocked by the fact that a prostitute on the streets\nwill charge only \u00a3 10-15 for sex. I then felt disgusted\nwith myself. By thinking that \u00a310-15 was a low price,\nI had accepted that sex is a commodity with a price\nupon it. Can you place a price on somebody's pride\nand self-respect? Is prostitution something to be\nashamed of anyway? It is easy to take a moral attitude\non behalf of 'society' but it is not so easy to take one\non behalf of the prostitute. The sad fact is that the\nprostitute is the loser in an all too frequent story of\npoverty and social stereotypes.\nOver this week I have begun to feel torn over the\nissue of prostitution. I feel sickened by the way that\nprostitutes are driven underground and victimised\nwithin our society, and yet I still cannot bring myself\nto accept a valuing of sex in monetary terms. To agree\nwith prostitution you have to be able to divorce sex\nfrom love. Maybe it's an old-fashioned viewpoint, but\nI do not believe they should be separated. This may\nseem a very religious stance to take, but I do not see\nwhy the church should have a monopoly on this\nprecept. People will inevitably argue against\nprostitution on the basis of religion, but I still feel that\nif you search within yourself, you will find far stronger\nreasons for opposing it.\nIn an ideal world people would not have to enter\nprostitution. Sadly, an ideal world is just that; a world\nin our minds. The most that Britain's prostitutes can\nhope for is an improvement in the country's benefits\nsystem and the removal of the labelling of 'common\nprostitutes'; those people we still see as guilty until\nproven innocent.\nFELIX\nMy term of office is rapidly nearing its end, much to\nmy own relief, and that of others, no doubt. I find\nmyself more and more disillusioned with the college,\nthe students' union and this pur ile microcosm which\nI find myself trapped in. The only thing that I still see\nas worthwhile at times is the production of FELIX. I often wonder why we report on a large part of the\ngoings on around the college. So much of it seems\nso trivial, and yet so many people get so upset about\nit all. I am coming to the conclusion that FELIX should\npromote greater discussion of topics outside the\ncollege. Imperial seems to be the home of the navel\nconte mpl at or, maybe this week's issue will raise a few heads.\nStaff Photograph\nThis year's staff photograph will be taken at lunchtime\nnext Wednesday. Anybody who has worked on FELIX\nthis year is welcome to turn up. We will meet in the\nFELIX Office at 12.45pm. The whole process should\nonly take about half an hour away from your revision.\nCredits\nMany thanks to last week's colla tors from the Royal\nCollege of Science Union. Unfortunately I did not take\na list but I recognised Nick from Broadsheet and Sid.\nI 'll print a list next week, if somebody sends me the\nnames. Thanks this week to Matthew Johnson for the\nfeature on Prostitution. Matthew spent a lot of time\nfinding information on the subject and I believe his\nefforts have resulted in the best feature so far this\nyear.

    "content": "Rag's fate?\nDear Dave,\nAs the person ultimately responsible for Rag Fete\nI would like to throw some light onto the events\nsurrounding it. In January I wrote to the conference\noffice giving them the date for Rag Fete as they\nwanted to know so as not to book something that\nwould clash with it. I went to see Mr Northy's secretary about the details of Rag Fete at the end of\nMarch. Mr Northy's secretary (who was very helpful)\nchecked up in their diary and said that there was a function provisionally booked in the MDH and that I should come back a few days later. Unfortunately\nCollege shut down before she could find out definitely\nand I could get back in contact with her-so Rag knew\nabout the problem from then.\nRag Fete then ran into a second and far more serious\nproblem-nobody was willing to do bugger all for it,\naside from the CCUs and ICCAG (who represented the\nmajority of what went on at last year's Rag Fete). The\nonly part of the Union to respond to requests for help\nwith Rag Fete came from Wing Chung who said they\ncouldn't think of anything they could do at Rag Fete\nso they wold make a small donation towards it which\nwas heartfelt and I would like to thank Wing Chung\non behalf of Rag for their donation. Last year's Rag\nFete made just under \u00a3800 (excluding costs such as\nposters etc) and I seem to remember the weather as\nbeing quite nice. We really could not hope to raise\nmore than last year's fe te and so doing it again this\nyear would require a lot of work by a lot of people to\nraise the same amount of money that could be raised\nby ten good collectors in an afternoon. The Leukaemia\nflag day in London on May 12 gave us the opportunity\nto raise more money than Rag Fete would have for\nless work. So for these reasons Steve Farrant and\nmyself decided to cancel Rag Fete. Unfortunately only\ntwo people (mummy, the superstar she is, and myself)\nwere willing to spend a couple of hours or so to go\nout and raise money.\nWhen I asked at the last Rag meeting whether\nanybody would be willing to raise any money\ntomorrow, nobody was forthcoming and many came\nup with excuses like 'But it's the FA Cup final'-this\nwould not bode very well if we had tried to run Rag\nFete and money would be wasted if nobody turned up.\nThis is really the main problem with Rag-if no one\nis willing to put a bit of time in for Rag then no money\nwill be raised. Rag was very active last term-by the\nend of term we were running two Rag raids a week\nand we raised a lot of money but were relying on a very small group of people. Rag would raise a lot more\nmoney if a lot of people were willing to put a small\namount of time into Rag every now and then, if only\njust to show they care.\nI would like to remind Dave Williams he is an ex-officio officer of Rag and receives minutes so should\nknow what is going on. I would also like to\ncongratulate Joe Fernley and John St Hill for their\nelection as C&G and RCS Vice Presidents-they have\nalready put in as much work for Rag as the current\nVPs have done since October.\nFinally I would like to make a plea: if nobody gives\na shit about Rag no money is made for charity so if\nanyone has got any time to spare tomorrow and is\nwilling to help raise some money for Leukaemia\nresearch could they either turn up at the Rag meeting\ntoday in the Lounge or at 10.30am tomorrow in the\nSnack Bar.\nLove and course work hassle,\nHal Calamvokis, Rag Chairman.\nNone so\nblind\nDear Dave,\nWe are writing to you concerning the letter No\nBenefit Given as published in last week's FELIX. The\nwriter of the letter raised a number of valid points. It\nis very difficult to get reasonable accommodation and\nthe accommodation office is not much help. All this\nmeans that the writer of the letter will have to use\nhis or her initiative and go out into the private sector.\nUnfortunately we do not think that the writer of the\nletter has any initiative at all. It seems that (s) he was\nunaware that housing benefit was being scrapped for\nstudents. If (s) he had actually read FELIX this year\n(s) he would have found out all about the Student\nLoans issue.\nYour editorial in FELIX 845 said on the subject of\nstudent loans, 'This means that you, yes YOU, will\nsee your grant rapidly devaluing with an instant loss\nof Housing Benefit...'. You went on to encourage your\nreaders to do something about it, to turn up to the\nEGM on Loans, to write to their MPs and to generally\nget off their apathetic backsides.\nThroughout the first two terms almost every FELIX\ncontained something about loans. As editor you have\ndone your job well in informing us, along with Neil\nMcCluskey, who has done a great deal of work, with\nreports in FELIX and in UGMs if anyone bothered to\nturn up.\nThe writer of last week's letter has no right to\ncomplain that the Union officers were doing nothing.\nA number of them spent a great deal of time writing\nto every Tory MP personally. All the debates in the\nHouse of Commons and even the Standing Committee\nwere attended. If the writer hadn't been so lazy (s) he\nwould have know that his or her Union officers have\ngot views about it.\nPerhaps the author of the letter should have signed\nit: 'Brain withheld by request'!\nYours,\nNames not withheld,\nJoe Fernley, Chris Browne.\nThanks\nDear Sir,\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank\neverybody for support and en coura g ment throughout\nmy campaign for IC Deputy President. The list is\nendless, but there are a few people I think merit a special mention. In particular, I would like to thank the\nSt Mary's crew for introducing me to two of the curry\nhouses in the area, and the FELIX team for a very\nenlightening artwork session. And also, Julian Dyson\nfor representing me at the count, which I was\nunavailable to attend due to 10% of my degree (!)\nhaving to be typed up and handed in the next day.\nAs to the criticism I received from Benny 'Krueger'\nTitner (FELIX pas sim) regarding the possible nightmare\nhe predicted, he should remember that there's one\nthink that people hate more than a sore loser, and\nthat's a bad winner!\nIf we learnt one thing from the campaign, that is\nthat we can run an election in a week, so Union please\nremember for the future. Anyway, it was interesting\nto compete, losing is not all gloom and doom.\nKeep smiling,\nSpenser Lane.\nMore thanks\nDear Dave,\nAt the local elections last week we failed to elect\nany Councillors. However, up to 60% of the eligible\nstudents turned out and voted, and it scared the\nopposition badly. Our councillors in both wards are\nnow highly receptive to our needs as well as those\nof local residents, and we met them on amicable terms\nas competent human beings, so a lot of good was\ndone by the process.\nI hope that those who confused us with the\nArchitectural Monstrosity Party or the Utter Lunatic\nGroup have overcome these handicaps-I'm glad to\nsee there are so few students like you around.\nNow-the credits (sorry!): a very very big thank you\nto every single person who voted. It's done the\nCollege a lot of good, and I hope it wasn't too painful.\nThanks are due to many people, who dropped what\nthey were doing to help. These include, but are not\nlimited to, Ric Davis, Murray, Dougie, Ben Turner,\nJackie Scott, Liz Warren, Louise for dropping her\ndinner, Rose for typesetting the oddest things, Andy\nfor printing DayGlo, Jen, Michelle and Fi for\naddressing a lot of labels, Dave Smedley for arranging\nthe printing of everything with very little notice and\nvast grace and patience, Syd and Cosmic for all the\nwork, John and Chris and Ken and Paula for standing,\nand for all that that entailed, and above all, Neil for\ndoing absolutely everything well and smiling through\nit.\nThank you all very much indeed.\nLove,\nTom Yates, Space Physics PG.\nDisgrace!\nDear Mr Smedley,\nWe strongly believe that you, as FELIX Editor,\nshould have withheld certain aspects of the 'Delator\nColumn' of the last issue (no 867), produced under\nthe pseudonym of Carolyne Toynbee.\nThe subject material of the first paragraph was of\na highly personal nature, and we find it offensive that\npeoples' private lives can be exploited in a manner\nwhich so strongly resembles the gutter press. If you\nare going to stoop to publishing such material then you\nshould at least have the courage to admit the true\nidentity of the authors.\nThis column has come close to causing offence\nbefore, but we feel that the naming of the people\nconcerned, without obtaining the prior permission, is\ntotally inexcusable, particularly as the article would\nhave been far more effective had their names not been\nmentioned.\nYou have shown total disregard for the personal\nfeelings of the people concerned, and we believe that\nan apology is in order. We trust that you will never\nlower yourself to this level again.\nYours sincerely,\nJane Hillier (ME1), Neal Hewitt {MFD, Mark Bland\nIME1), Dan Homolka (M2), Phil Sharp (Ml), Richard\nJones (Phyiscs 2), Malcolm Myers (EE2), Martyn\nReynolds (Phyiscs 2), Gaurang Chadba (FED, Nina\nMukhojee (EE1), Tara Wright (ME 1), Alison Sampson\n(ME1), AledJenner (CE1), Alex McLintock (DoCV,\nEye Davison (EE1), Zayeed Alam (CE1).\nRumours of strawberry emotion lotion and\nhandcuffs have reached the FELIX Office.

    "content": "Neil McCluskey goes on about Local Elections, Loans, Athletics, Welfare, Nightline and yet more E The President rambles\nWelcome back to the summer term and the first in my\nseries of concluding reports. Good luck to everybody\nwho has got exams. For those of you that have\nalready finished, have a great time, relax, enjoy the\nsun but do have a little consideration for those\nstudents still doing exams.\nLocal Government Elections\nMost of you will have noticed that Imperial College\nhad candidates standing in the local council elections.\nJohn Finley and Chris Owen in the Knightsbridge Ward\nof Westminster and Ken and Paula Young in the\nCourtfield Ward of Kensington and Chelsea.\nAlthough we did not succeed in actually getting\ncouncillors elected we most certainly worried a number of parties and got ourselves recognised as a credible, well organised and extremely large group of\nresidents. Most prospective and elected councillors\nwere respectful of the fact that, of the residents\npresently living in halls of residence appearing on the\nelectoral roll, well over 65% turned out to vote for\ntheir own candidates.\nThis operation has certainly got you, the students,\nnoticed and will go a very long way to maintaining\ndiscussions on the matters that we would have\nwanted discussing if our own councillors had been\nelected. Those discussions will start very soon.\nThanks must go to a very large number of people.\nPrimarily you the students who went out to vote.\nSecondly to the candidates for standing. Thirdly to the\nhelpers both before-hand and on the day. In particular;\nTom Yates, Liz Warren, Doug King, Michael Paton,\nClaire Stewart, Jackie Scott, Sydney Harbour-Bridge\nand everybody else who ran round halls persuading\npeople to vote.\nSpecial thanks to David Smedley and the FELIX\ncrew for producing promptly, cheaply and efficiently\nmuch needed publicity.\nI feel that this is an exercise that should certainly\nbe repeated in future and from now on close relations\nshould be maintained with the councils concerned.\nLoans\nThe student top-up loans bill has passed through\nparliament and is now law.\nFrom reading a letter written to the FELIX Editor\n(4.5.901 it appears that at least one student is still\nunaware that along with the top-up loans scheme,\nstudents are to be removed from the state social\nsecurity system. This student also seems to be of the\nopinion that a student union can wave its magic wand\nand persuade the government to change its mind.\nSadly my magic wand is limp and lifeless from the\nvigorous activities of recent months, so a miracle I cannot thus perform. I wonder how many more\nstudents are deaf, dumb, blind and brainless enough\nnot to notice the situation they're going to be in come\nOctober 1990!!\nOn the subject of removal of benefits it is likely that\nthis amendment to the social security act will be\ndiscussed in Parliament some time in May or June.\nJudging from the replies we've had from MPs it seems\nunlikely that the government will change its mind. All\nwe can hope for is that discussions will go on for so\nlong as to delay the bill until the parliamentary recess.\nI have already requested at the College's Governing\nBody that College sets up a hardship fund, along\nsimilar lines to the housing benefit, into which it can\nput the government 'access' funds (funds put aside\nby government to replace the state benefits).\nStudents presently claim approximately \u00a3 6 9 million\nper annum and the access funds only total \u00a325 million\nper annum!\nAthletics & Sports\nHarlington-Contracts have now been signed to start\nwork on the astroturf. Work has already begun even\nthough we have not yet got local planning permission.\nSouthside Gym-There are plans in hand to convert\nSouthside Gym into a commer ical fitness club with\npreferential rates for students. This is likely to affect\na number of clubs but hopefully not too adversely.\nTalks will be held soon to discuss everybody's requirements. The fitness club could generate a large\namount of external income for disposal on student\nclubs/societies. If anybody has any ideas then please\ncome and talk to me soon.\nWelfare\nThere are no formal welfare campaigns this term but\nfrom a week's time onwards a house hunting\ninformation pack will be available from the Union\nWelfare Office. This contains essential information on\nthe do's and don'ts of entering into contracts with\nlandlords, etc. Yve Posner and I are also hoping to\nstage a 'roadshow' in Evelyn Gardens and Prince's Gardens to promote the pack to unsuspecting first\nyears who have probably never rented a place (other\nthan at College). Well, somebody's got to do what the\naccommodation office should be doing.\nNightline\nFurther discussion with College Welfare Committee,\nthe Nightline Steering Committee and the Rector have\nled almost nowhere. Anne Conlon, the Chairman of\nthe Nightline Steering Committee, has tried\nunsuccessfully to find alternative accommodation but\nthe Rector is still insisting that the notice to quit at\nthe end of June will be enforced. What does\nUGM/Council think of the idea of adopting Nightline\nas a Union society, picking up the administrative\nburden ourselves and possibly even having Nightline\nin the Union building? Incidentally, the last of these\nsuggestions I'm reluctant to implement since, if\nNightline is to remain on campus, it might as well stay\nwhere it is!\nElections\nCongratulations to Ben Turner on being elected\nDeputy President. His posters have caused a minor\nhassle but I fully support Fiona in her decision to allow\nthe posters to be used. I refuse to be drawn into\nfurther discussion on this matter as the event is not\nover and all posters should have been removed. Good\nluck to all the sabbatical-elects in their exams.\nNeil McCluskey, ICU President.\nASSISTANT\nSUBWARDEN\nSelkirk & Tizard Halls\nPositions available starting in September\nWe are looking for bright, enthusiastic,\nhardworking, organised people who are interested\nin students' welfare and who can solve students'\nproblems sympathetically and effectively.\nThese positions pay nothing, but do come with free College accommodation.\nApplication forms are available from the:\nStudent Accommodation Office, 15 Princes Gardens\nNOW\nCompleted forms should go to:\nThe Warden Selkirk & Tizard Halls, Prince's Gardens SW7 1LU Closing date: Friday May 18\n\n"

    "content": "Internal Affairs\nFilm Book\nWho watches the watchmen? A loose translation of\na rather well known latin phrase, it makes a point. In\nthe case of the Los Angeles County Police it's the\nInternal Affairs Division to which Raymond Avila\n(Andy Garcia) has just been promoted. Assigned a partner-Sergeant Amy Wallace-he starts work\ninvestigating a cop who is suspected of planting\nevidence, using excessive violence and taking drugs.\nSoon though, the investigations start to focus on\nDennis Peck (Richard Gere), a well respected,\nstreetwise cop who seems to be a little too well off.\nThe closer Avila gets the tougher things become, until\neventually his wife becomes involved.\nA cop thriller with a twist (cops hunting cops), the\nfilm is rather liberally sprinkled with stereotypes and\nclich es. The cop whose marriage is in difficulty\nbecause of the amount of time he spends working,\nthe butch lesbian ('tactfully' referred to as a 'dyke'),\netc...None of the roles are particularly involving, each\nperforming much as expected, and never giving any\nof the actors a real challenge. Thus, un surprisingly, acting is perfectly adequate throughout.\nThis should have been enough to kill the film stone\ndead. Somehow it wasn't. The plot, not so much a whodunnit as a 'how's he gonna get him' movie, has\nsufficient twists to keep one interested. The violence\nis sickening without being graphic, merely serving to\nhighlight the nauseating nature of Peck's actions. It\nis one of two devices used to relieve the incredible\ntension that is built up at certain times through the\nfilm, and by far the most common. The other is\nhumour, but good 'ole comic relief plays little part alas.\nIt is this tension that is critical to a film of thriller genre,\nand this film has it in abundance. So what we have\nis an above average film, which somehow contrives\nto be more than its component parts and which is well\nworth a look 'if you like that sort of thing'.\nAdam T. Reanimator II\nFilm\nThis film has everything: Necrophilia, a fruit bat, small\ncute furry (dead) animals, gratuitous amputations and\nbuckets-count them, buckets-of blood.\nReanimator 2 follows on in the same vein (sorry)\nas its predecessor with the continuing adventures of\nHerbert West (mad scientist) and Dan Cain (poor\nmisled soul). This time the boys aren't reanimating but\ncreating (so we're told) and naturally they decide on\na fine figure of a woman (in great horror tradition). To\nachieve this noble goal Herb takes to petty pilfering\nfrom the hospital morgue (a sequence of\nun impeach ably good taste) and takes them to the\nCELLAR. The CELLAR, as you might expect, is chock-full of much extrovert glass tubing and fluorescent\nliquid. We are then treated to some very bad scientific\nmethod and much hysterically unconvincing\nrational is ation( the amniotic fluid of a lizard\nreanimates, would you believe?). It is at this point that\nthe acting begins to come into its own; Jeffrey Combs\nas Our Man deadpans through the best lines in the\nmovie 'She is my creation! I will not be shackled by\nthe failures of your God!' and is nobly supported by\nBruce Abbot as the Faithful But Unfortunate Sidekick,\nDan Cain. Claude Earl Jones plays a cop who senses\nThere Is Something Wrong and flips his badge at\neveryone (and everything). Mel Stewart plays the\npathologist No-one Will Believe when he stumbles\nacross the secret of the Reanimation fluid and brings\nthe head of Dr Hill from the first film back to life.\nSpecial Effects are by Screaming Mad George, who\nnot only brings an eyeball and four fingers to life but\nalso a whole CELLAR-full of bizarre freaks. Things to\nlook out for: 1) the genuinely disturbing a syl y m sequence 2) The maiming of the dog 3) The heroine\nbacking away from something nasty into something\nnastier 4) the odd fleeting reference to HP Lovecraft\nto whom this whole story is apparently due, albeit\nwith severe editing 5) Various gratuitous spurts of\nblood 6) The line 'My God, they're using tools!'. One\nof the notable sequences is when the Bride finally gets\nup and running (well not quite) and goes through an\nelaborate Greek tragedy about the sadness of being\nunloved, half skinned and dead. This is made all the\nmore tragic by the fact that the cast are busy losing\ntheir lunches and/or gibbering and the audience,\nsimilarly.\nReanimator 2 (which features the appalling subtitle\nBride of Reanimator) is badly acted, badly scripted,\ndelightfully camp and absolutely brilliant. If you can't take the gore stay out of the CELLAR. Oh yes....there\nreally is a fruit bat. Watch out for it.\nThe Amazing Flying Gerbil Machine.\nWhy Men\nAre the\nWay They\nAre\nby Warren Farrell, PhD\nThe simple answer is that women make them that\nway. Every day women push men to conform to the\nmould, and the pressure is great, you either conform\nor are called a wimp or jerk.\nThe basic concept that is the hub of the book, is\nthe fact that men and women both have a primary\nfantasy, something that they want desperately to\ncome true. Man's is to have sex with beautiful\nwomen, preferably more than one, and for women it\nis to become secure, normally in financial terms.\nThis may seem sexist, misguided and in this modern\nsociety, old fashioned, man the provider of money in\nreturn for sex with a beautiful woman, but too much\nof what he says is true for it to be complete rubbish.\nTake the issue of women's magazines, in his words\n'female pornography'. How can women buy\nmagazines like 'House and Garden' which advocate\nmarriage and home life and yet ask why men expect\nthem to become housewives?-They want to\nthemselves! Even the supposed liberated new woman\nmagazines confirm that a woman's ideal man is one\nwith money that can provide her with security, giving\nher the option to work or not. This option is never\nconsidered by a man, you work or you starve, is this\nfair?\n'New Woman' is for liberated working women who\nwant to be treated equally with men. If this is true why\nis it that the majority of the advertising is for beauty\nand fashion products? Does wearing the latest French\nperfume make the office more productive? The male\nequivalent, in terms of business, something like\n'Business News' is full of adverts for office chairs,\ncomputers, all things that are slightly more useful and\nrelevant.\nWarren Farrell explains all this and more, including\na good chapter on the 'new sexism', the sexism\nagainst men that is not perceived as such by women.\nWhy is it fair to ridicule men about his intellect but\nto do the same to women is deemed sexist. I recommend all women to read at least this part and\nif they see no truth in it, there is no hope for equality.\nWomen may find what he says hurting and unfair,\nreacting against it by saying 'I'm not like that!', but\nthe truth hurts. Women have double standards-they\nwant men to be open with their feelings but if they\ngo too far they are called weak and feeble. They also\ncomplain that they have changed, so why can't men?\nThe answer is that men would be more than willing\nto change but what exactly do women want?\nReading the book as a man I have empathy with\nmuch of what he says, most of it is common sense\nif you are reasonable. Is it unfair to expect women to\npay their way, to share the financial burden as much\nas they want men to share the housework?\nI recommend this book not only to women but men\nas well, but don't take everything to heart or it could\ndamage your life in a way it was never intended to.\nIan Hodge.\n5\n\n"

    "content": "Downright s lagging s and bussed-in grannies. Local elections are even dirtier than IC Union's. Liz W gives an inside view of the IC Party campaign.\nKnockers and Tellers\nHistory was made last week when Imperial College\nput up candidates for the local council elections in the\ntwo wards where their halls of residence are\nconcentrated: Knightsbridge in Westminster and\nCourtfield in Kensington and Chelsea.\nAlthough we did not win, we certainly fulfilled one\nof our aims, which was to make our local councillors\nsit up and take notice of the students and their needs.\nOne of the victorious Conservatives candidates in\nKnightsbridge said on polling day, 'If I win I 'll certainly\nbe around to talk to you. You've shown us we can't ignore you.'\nThe elections also gave some of us a fascinating\ninsight into how elections are fought: a whole world\nthat is hidden from the ordinary voters who simply\nturn up at the polling station and cast their vote.\nHaving decided that my revision could look after itself\nfor a while, I promised to spend the whole of Thursday\nMay 3rd, polling day, working for the good of the IC\nParty. My obvious enthusiasm to turn up before 8 am,\nwhen polling started, also earned me the further\nprivilege of being asked to attend the count the\nfollowing morning as one of the IC Party's counting\nagents.\nArriving at quarter to eight, I headed for the nerve\ncentre of operations, the party 'committee room',\nwhich had been set up in the Union President's office.\nThere was a second committee room for the\nCourtfield ward in Evelyn Gardens. From here the\nactions of the various helpers were coordinated\nthroughout the day by the election agents, Union\nPresident Neil McCluskey and Union Council Chairman\nTom Yates.\nMy first task was being sent over to the polling\nstation to 'tell'. This involves collecting people's polling cards, polling number or name and address.\nThese are then ferried back to the committee room\nwhere they are checked off against the electoral roll.\nThey are also checked off against lists of known\nsupporters. Usually for a party this means the people\nwho have said they will vote for that party when\ncanvassed prior to the election. In our case we were\nchecking off the names of students in halls, since this\nwas where we thought our support was most likely\nto be.\nThis leads on to the other main process, 'knocking\nup'. Lists were made of all those students who had\nnot yet voted and we then visited their rooms\nreminding them that the election was happening and\nasking them to go and vote. This process began\naround lunchtime and continued throughout the day\nuntil polling closed.\n\u2022Oft,\nWBBBBBBM\nWBBBBEBBEMm\nI hadn't realised just how effective knocking up can\nbe until after I came back from covering my first hall.\nOnly about five people from the hall had already voted\nbefore knocking up began. A lot of people didn't seem\nto be in and I spoke to only a dozen or so: this was\na little dispiriting, as about seventy people lived there,\nbut at least most of them had said they intended to\nvote. A few minutes after I got back to the committee\nroom, some telling returns came in; about half the\nstudent votes were from people in the hall I had just\nbeen to. My doubts about slogging up and down stairs\nand talking to people I had never met before receded\nsomewhat.\nLater we left notes in the rooms of those people\nX HH REiS U LTS Votes Cast Knightsbridge Votes Cast Courtfield\nBailey Liberal 39 Conservatives 880; 855; 830\nCooze Labour 100 Liberal 627; 627; 519\nFinley ICP 420 Ken and\nMacKeith Liberal 37 Paula Young ICP 279; 254\nMichaels Conservative 852 Green 185\nMoreland Conservative 857 Labour 189; 182; 155\nOwen ICP 404 Residents Action\nSearle Labour 74 Party 55\nTotal Votes Cast 1419\nLinstead Hall 1143\nKinnerton Street 265\nPostal 11\nwho were out, telling them we had called and this also\nseemed effective in encouraging the students to vote.\nTowards the end of the day, knocking up becomes\never more vital and can dig out those people who\nmight otherwise not have bothered voting. It also\nbecame frantic as we had too few helpers to cover\nall the halls as often as we would have liked. One of\nthe helpers met two others on the sixth floor of\nLinstead. 'What are you doing here?' he asked. They\nreplied that they had just started knocking up the hall.\nHe told them that he had just finished it. It had taken\nhim an hour and a half, so long we had forgotten we\nhad sent him!\nI became very aware of why all these activities were\nso important since I had to explain to a large number\nof students during the day just why it was I wanted\ntheir polling cards or their name. This helped relieve\nthe tedium of sitting outside the polling station, as did\nhaving to constantly redirect people because the\nentrance to the polling station had been altered from\nprevious years.\nAnother aspect that enlivens telling is the chance\nto chat to the other tellers who are there. The Labour\nParty and the Liberal Democrats hadn't sent tellers\nsince they didn't expect to poll many votes and\nwouldn't want to knock up, but I had some very\ninteresting conversations with the Conservative tellers\nwho I found myself matched with. It was a pleasure\nto meet one resident who said she thought the\nstudents were very courteous 'since they always turn\ntheir music down around eleven o 'clock at night and\ndon't bother us at all' and who seemed more than\nhappy to share her local area with us.

Just now and again\nI feel I should react to one or two. Take rents: students\nare fully involved in giving advice on this issue; but\nthe decision has to be taken by the chap who carries\nthe ultimate financial responsibility. It has to be the\nRector-it always was. I can't tell you how much I would like to pin it onto someone else...\nYou say 'rents are rising'. If that statement is to be\nmeaningful it has to be set against changes in the rpi\n(roughly reflecting the costs incurred) and the level\nof student grants. The decision for 1990/91 is that\nthe average rent in College accommodation will rise\nby 2.8%; the maximum rise, in S Kensington, will be\n4.5%; the increase in student grants is 7.4%; the\nOctober to October increase in rpi will probably be\naround 9%. In essence, the real rent for next year has\nbeen reduced-in the face of a mounting deficit in the\nstudent residence account. That was not an easy\ndecision for me to take. I cannot assume that all\nmembers of the Governing Body will see it as\nresponsible. No doubt they will tell me.\nThe suggestion that services to students have been\ncut more, than the overall cut sustained by the College\nover the last few years, again does not bear\nexamination. However what worries me most is the\ngrating tone of voice-the waves of nihilism which\nseem to inform your comments. Your suggestion that\n'I do not believe this College has any further wish to\neducate undergraduates' is so very remote from the\ntruth, that it is a puzzle to know where to start. It's worth asking why any of us chose to work in a university in the first place. If one seeks a career as\na researcher, one can work in many different kinds\nof institutions which do not have any link to\neducation. The reason, for the vast majority of us, for\nDear Editor,\nLast week I submitted the article entitled\n'Homosexuality-is the stereotype true?'. Atlhough\nit was probably a little clumsy in its ideas it was meant\nto put forward the view that homosexuality, and gays\nin person, aren't as bad as they are often suggested\nto be. The reason for writing the article was primarily\nto put forward that view but I had also hoped to use\nit as a vehicle for 'coming out' myself. However at\nthe last moment bravery went out of the window and\nI asked for my name to be withheld. So what stopped\nme? Good old fashioned fear of course. Not just the\nfear that I could have the shit beaten out of me (that\nis possibly one painful outcome), but more importantly\nthe fear of being rejected by those around me, i.e. those on my course and in my hall. That fear is one\nprobably everybody can identify with and thus it is not\nsurprising I remained anonymous.\nseeking a university career is that we enjoy teaching,\nboth at undergraduate and at postgraduate levels.\nBefore I came here I did rather a lot of teaching\nmyself-first year students as well as MSc students.\nI worked with a group of PhD students. When I leave\nhere I hope to do a bit more of both. Most academic\nstaff see the opportunity to teach as a privilege and\nnot as a chore. It is true that the College has a greater\nstake in research than do most universities in the UK.\nThat is why we are Imperial College and not the\nUniversity of X. That commitment to research is not\ninstead of a commitment to teaching. The search for\nthe new is wholly supportive of the mission to portray\nwhat is known-to those for whom it is new.\nYour stance to 'The College' and its inmates is so\noften a caricature of reality that I do wonder whether\nyou ever talk to any of the people concerned-that\nafter all is what editors normally do. Let me put it\npersonally. I think we have only met once, and that\nbriefly, at the very beginning of the academic year.\nIt's easy to make an appointment with me-especially\nif you are prepared to get up early. I might, or might\nnot be able to persuade you of the commitment of my\ncolleagues, and myself, to all members of the College.\nAt least it would help you to get facts right (eg who\nsits on the Management Planning Group).\nIn a sense it is easier to build up a caricature in your\nmind, to feed it with guesses, then to see it in print,\nproviding further corroboration of those dark\nsuspicions. It is easier than exploring the truth. But\nDave, truth is, not infrequently, a good deal more\ninteresting than fiction.\nYours sincerely,\nEric Ash.\nSo who does sit on Management Planning Group?\nI am still certain that no Union representative\ndoes.\nBut why do I want to come out anyway? A number\nof reasons I suppose, but especially that it feels I am\ndenying part of myself and being made to feel dirty\nand ashamed when I do anything to justify those\nemotions. I haven't had any 'relationships' but even\nif I had, would that really make me worse than\neverybody else? However the main reason why I want\nto come out is that being gay very often means\nkeeping your feelings (anger, pain and joy) to yourself\nand very often struggling on alone. So I suppose like\nmany other people, gay or straight, I'm just looking\nfor a little extra emotional support and of course for\npeople to say it doesn't matter. Whether that will be\nthe case is another point entirely. If nothing else,\nperhaps I will learn a hard lesson in the benefits of\nkeeping my mouth shut!\nYours,\nJason Fisher.\nComing out\n\n"

    "content": "As you seat yourself in the reasonably comfortable\nBarbican theatre, the scene is already being set. On\na pristine black stage a group of actors in evening\ndress gyrate gracefully. They retire to the back of the\nstage as the doors close in their eerie fashion, and the\nplay commences. Thus unfolds a commonplace tale\nof wicked uncles and brothers, shepherds, fools, cross\ndressing and love. Rosalind lives at the court of her\nuncle, Duke Frederick who has usurped Rosalind's father. Rosalind is banished after she falls in love with\nOrlando, the youngest son of a friend of the usurped\nDuke. She then flees to the forest of Arden where her\nfather is hiding. Orlando also flees there because of\nhis maltreatment at the hands of his elder brother,\nOliver. When they meet Rosalind is disguised as a shepherd boy, and so Orlando doesn't recognise her...\nAs you might have guessed Shakespeare comedies\ncan have somewhat complicated plots. In this case\nmuch of the above is nigh on totally irrelevant to the\nmain thrust of the play, and is only used to set up the\nsituation that develops in the forest. Its certainly a much lighter play than Coriolanus, and one that leads\nPage 4\nCoriolanus\nRome. Long before the days of the Caesars it is little\nmore than a city-state at war with its neighbours, the\nVolscians. Famine has hit the city and the plebeians\nare up in arms against the ruling classes, the\npatricians. Most hated of all is Caius Martius. The\noutbreak of war halts the riots and in the siege of the\ntown of Corioli, Caius Martius earns himself the title\n'Coriolanus'. He soon finds out that the wartime hero\nhas less of a role in peacetime and before long he\nlooses all popularity with the people. His own\narrogance leads to his banishment from Rome and\nplans for revenge.\nCoriolanus is the last of Shakespeare's tragedies\nand quite probably the most political. It is a tale of the\npeople against the ruling classes and the destruction\nof a man who is an anachronism, the last remnant of\na dying system. The Tarquins have been driven from\nRome and the republican system is beginning to rise.\nCaius Martius Coriolanus is a man of great military\nprowess. An arrogant man but one who hates to hear\nhimself praised. One who sticks to his own principles,\nrefusing to bow to the people even when it will lead\nto his political destruction. A complicated and many\nfaceted character that could have easily degenerated\ninto a one dimensional stereotype in the hand of a less\ntalented actor than the one who turns in such a superb\nperformance here, Charles Dance. He even looks\nexactly right for the part, that 'lean and hungry look'\nthat was to worry Caesar many generations later, and\nmanages to dominate the stage at all the right\nmoments for example as he stand at the open gates\nof Corioli, drenched in blood.\nMore light is shed on this central character by the\nequally splendid Volumnia, played by Barbara Jeffard.\nShe comes across as a woman who is very different\nfrom the traditional female role (as personified by\nVirgilia, Coriolanus' wife) she actively drives her son\ninto battle so he can win the glory that she desperately\nwants. A strikingly forceful portrayal that is thrown\ninto sharp relief by the later scenes where she has to\nbeg for the safety of the city.\nThe rest of the patricians make little impact but they\ndo not play nearly as an important role as the\nplebeians, the mob, the common people. They are\nportrayed as people whose opinions are easily swayed\nby the orator, but who have great power when they\nto you leaving the theatre with a generally healthy and\noptimistic attitude to life in contrast to the very dark\nending of the Roman affair.\nAs the play progresses and more and more of the\ncentral characters end up in the forest, the segments\nof the black stage are lifted away revealing a grassy\nenvironment beneath. Eventually, at the beginning of\nthe second half, we have a pastoral scene complete\nwith anorexic tr if fids and some extremely na ff flying\nbutterflies.\nAgainst this changing background the characters\nthemselves change. Rosalind moves from the\nrestrained girl at court to the ebullient and perky\n'Ganymede', Celia from the formal girl at court to the\ncarefree shepherd girl and even Orlando from\nembittered younger brother to enamored lover. The\ncast manage all this without any problem especially\nSophie Thompson as Rosalind, who gives an\nenrapturing performance. Also of note is Mark\nWilliams as Touchstone, the fool, who transfers the\nhumour of Shakespeare's words into even funnier\ngestures.\nTheatre\nact together. Careful casting has allowed individual\n'characters' to emerge while still retaining a group\nidentity. They also carry spears when required with\ngreat finesse.\nTheir representatives, the Tribunes, are conniving,\ncowardly and often extremely funny. The RSC really\nare able to lift apparently bland lines to great comedic\neffect. There are times when one is able to forget that\none is listening to formalised language from three\ncenturies ago. Their clothes changing from plebeian\nblack to patrician white after they banish Coriolanus\nis also a nice touch.\nThe costumes throughout reflect the important\nclass divisions in the play. Apart from those\nmentioned above, the warlike Volscians are dressed\nin blood red, and the patrician women are dressed in\na white/black mix that possibly implies a slightly lower\nstation than their husbands. Interestingly the only time\nCoriolanus appears dressed mainly in black is when\nhe is fighting-the only time he has the approval of\nthe plebeians. The actual design of the costume\nreflects traditional Roman dress without slavishly\nfollowing it, giving us a slightly abstract period sense.\nThe intimidating scenery and climactic music all add\nto the sheer dramatic force of this production. Terry\nHands and John Barton have taken a difficult play and\nproduced a superb slice of theatre. This really is a must see. The RSC at their very best.\nAdam T. Theatre\nA fairly gentle, almost pastoral, romantic comedy,\nit has a wonderful sense of fun that seeps out into\nthe audience, infecting them. A glorious production\nwhose only faults are those inherent in the play, and\nthose butterflies, of course.\nAdam T. As You Like It\n\n"

    "content": "different from the normal way we encounter the\nlocals: complaining about the noise our parties make.\nTelling is basically a co-operative affair, since it is\nimpossible for each teller to get every number. We\nsoon worked out a fine system whereby we wrote\ndown the numbers and the Conservatives received the\ncards. Telling is also a chance to hear the comments\npeople make as they leave the polling station, which\ncan be very funny. I think the IC Party provided some\nparticular gems on this occasion. One voter, on being\ntold that every Conservative vote was crucial since\nthe students were turning out and voting for their own\ncandidates, was heard to exclaim, 'Do the students\nhave votes? How terrible! It shouldn't be allowed!'\nLater an old lady pushing another in a wheelchair, who\nhad been brought to the polling station by\nConservative helpers, was heard to say as they left,\n'There, that wasn't so painful, was it?' Another\nConservative voter was heard to say, 'I know\nstudents have to have the vote, but why do they have\nto have it here?'\nAnother area that produced a certain amount of\namusement was the name of the party. Actually\nstanding for 'Independent Counsellors', but\nabbreviated to ICP on the ballot papers to ensure the\nstudents knew who they were voting for, there were\nsome rather odd guesses from some of the other\nvoters as to what it might stand for. These ranged\nfrom 'Independent Candidates' (quite close) to\n'International Communists' (we're a bit worried that\nmight have created the wrong impression).\nDuring the day the two committee rooms kept in\ntouch with each other by telephone and exchanged\nhelpers as the number at each site fluctuated. In the\nearly evening, the Evelyn Gardens committee room\nwas to be augmented by two paid students. Tom,\ndirecting the Union Office committee room, phoned\nup Neil in Evelyn Gardens to ask if they had arrived\nand to request the return of some helpers he had sent\ndown there earlier. Suddenly Tom exploded into a fit\nof expletives and starting shouting 'They're not\nsupposed to do that, it's illegal. You'll get five years\nin prison. More to the point I 'll get five years in prison!'\nCalming down a little, he explained (to the\nenlightenment of both Neil and those of us sitting in\nthe committee room who were bemused by this\noutburst) that it is illegal to pay canvassers and that\nknocking up could be classed as canvassing. This was\napparently what the paid helpers were doing. Tom\nthen reverted back to demanding the students were\ntaken off knocking up. 'If the Conservatives find\nout....' Eventually Neil managed to get a word in\nedgeways and point out that the students had actually\nagreed to work for free and that the law wasn't being\nbroken at all. Tom flopped back into his chair in relief.\nDuring the day, the members of the local\nConservative party also provided us with a lot of\namusement. When I started telling at 8 am, I met the\nlocal branch chairman. He seemed a little surprised we\nhad sent tellers, but confined himself to remarking,\n'Oh, so you're the people who are giving us a run for\nour money, are you?' The second teller had a long\nargument with one of our other helpers, in which she\nappeared to believe both that students were very\nimportant (because they had votes), but that they\nwere really second class citizens (and shouldn't have\nvotes) because 'they're only here for three years,\nwhile we've lived here all our lives'. She completely\nmisunderstood that while individual students are only\naround for three or four years, and most only get the\nchance to live in hall for one year, the student body\nas a whole has been in the area since at least the\nfifties when many of the halls were built, probably\nlonger than most of the so- called 'long term'\nresidents.\nDuring the morning Tom and others had been\naddressing first year lectures, urging those in hall to\nvote. In at least one lecture theatre he received\nrapturous applause. Meanwhile ex-Union President\nPage 14\nSydney Harbour-Bridge attempted on at least two\noccasions to talk to students but on arriving the at the\ndesignated lecture theatre found that the lecture had\nmoved.\nBecause of these efforts, there was a rush of\nstudents voting as they returned to hall for lunch.\nSuddenly, between 12.30 and 1.30, we realised we\nhad nearly half the votes from the Linstead ballot box,\nmeaning we had about 40% overall. (There was\nanother, smaller ballot box in Kinnerton Street, on the\nother side of the ward.) The Conservatives, in their\ncommittee room, must also have realised it as well\nand began to panic. Although it is normal for them to\nbring in by car those voters who have difficulty\nwalking, and although this normally happens in mid-afternoon, some of our returning tellers remarked\nstand Vv\n~' - L Serpentine d have turned out and are voting for their candidates\nand, you know, we're in danger of losing this ward\nfor the first time ever, and that would be terrible'.\nThe amusing side for me was that, having been in\nthe committee room, I now knew which polling\nnumbers belonged to students. There were several\nyoung people who weren't students, but looked like\nit. Needless to say, she didn't ask them and so her\ntelling returns, on which she was marking definite\nConservative votes, looked far worse than I felt the\nreal situation was.\nFinally nine o 'clock and the end of polling crawled\non. We trudged back to the Union Office with the last\ntelling sheets and then headed to one of the\ncandidates' flats for a celebratory bottle of\nchampagne, some food and story swapping.\n0\nGallery\n^f \"\u2014 *#l4eT fiona l\" Coslbrookctale J_ XIi The count itself was held in Porchester Hall, north of\nHyde Park, and began at 9 am. We had been warned\nthat our ballot box was not likely to be opened until\nat least 10.15, but we decided to arrive early to work\nout what was going on. In the event, the\nKnightsbridge box was not opened until after eleven,\nso we had plenty of time to look at everything as well\nas get a cup of coffee.\nI arrived first and after wandering around to see if\nI could find the others (our two candidates, John\nFinley and Chris Owen, and Tom, the election agent),\nI watched what was happening. I had already talked\nto a friend who had given me a good idea of how the\ncount works, so I rapidly picked up what was going\non. They had just opened the first set of ballot boxes\nand the counters were straightening out the ballot\nsuccess of the IC Party.) Feeling a little smug with my\nsuperior, if recently gained, knowledge, I explained.\nEach teller is given a template. This is a strip of card\ndivided into blocks matching the size of the blocks\ncontaining the candidates names on the ballot paper.\nEach of the blocks on the template is coloured\naccording to the corresponding candidate's party: blue\nfor Conservative, red for Labour, green for Liberal\nDemocrats and white for all other parties. The\ncounters hold the papers against the strip, instantly\nbeing able to identify which candidates have been\nvoted for by colour and saving them the difficulty and\npossible error of reading the names. Each paper\ncontaining a 'ticket' vote, that is a vote for all the\ncandidates of one of the three parties mentioned\nabove party, goes into a box labelled with the\nha\nrather unkindly that 'it looked like they'd been digging\nthem out of the grave'. I am sure they would not have\ngot some of the older people out to vote if it had not\nbeen such a glorious day.\nAs evening drew on, we realised that our share of\nthe votes had fallen somewhat and we knew that we\nwere unlikely to win unless large numbers of the\nsurrounding residents had heeded our canvassing and\nhad deserted the Conservatives for us. This seemed\nunlikely. However the public face of the Conservatives\nwas still panicking. This was an old lady who was\nstopping obvious Conservative voters after they came\nout of the polling station and asking them which way\nthey had voted. (This is not illegal; asking them on the\nway in is, however.) When they replied that they had\nvoted Conservative, she would harangue them 'Oh,\ndo please tell all your friends to vote. The students\nThe Evelyn Gardens polling station appeared to have\nproduced as many amusing incidents as Linstead. A Liberal Democrat candidate, having realised that we\nwere knocking up in the halls of residence, tried to\ngain admittance to do some canvassing. In vain.\nStudents sitting at windows on the ground and first\nfloor completely ignored his impassioned pleas.\nKnocking on one door, it was opened by Ken Young,\nthe warden. With a sinking heart the Liberal Democrat\nrecognised him as one of the IC candidates. Bravely\nploughing on, he asked if he might come in to canvass.\nHe received a curt no and a slammed door in the face.\nLater he was evicted from one of the other halls when\nfound wandering about by the warden.\nWe retired to bed eventually. Westminster is\nsensible and holds its count the following morning\nrather than into the small hours after polling closes.\npapers, counting them into bundles of fifty and\nclipping them together with clothes pegs. This was to\nallow the total number of papers to be counted to\nensure that they matched the numbers of papers\nhanded out at the polling station. When it came to our\nbox, they initially miscounted and had to recount,\nfinding an extra five votes, which seemed to satisfy\nthem.\nAt this stage, Tom arrived and I explained what had\nhappened so far. Tom then surprised me by asking\nhow they actually counted the votes, since each paper\nhad two or three crosses on it. At this point he\nrevealed that he had never helped in elections before,\nbeyond doing a few hours telling and had no idea how\nthe count worked. (I would never have guessed. Tom\nran the committee room in an extremely professional\nmanner and deserves a great deal of the credit for the\nappropriate colour. All other votes (mixed parties,\nindependents or containing less than the maximum\nnumber of votes) go into the 'non-ticket' box. The\nticket votes are then counted into bundles of fifty and\nclipped with clothes pegs of the appropriate colour.\nAny 'doubtful' votes, where the voting intentions\nare not entirely clear, are adjudicated on by the\nreturning officer in the presence of the election\nagents. The non-ticket votes are then counted. This\nis done by giving each pair of counters a sheet with\nthe candidates' names and a grid of small boxes. One\ncounter reads off the names on the ballot papers and\nthe other marks ticks against that candidate's name.\nThese are then totalled and added to the ticket votes.\nIC caused some confusion because our votes were all\nnon-ticket. This meant that instead of having about\n200 non-ticket votes they had considerably more to\ndeal with and it took quite a lot longer than usual to\ncount. Our totals on the sheets looked particularly\nsatisfying. But of course we had no ticket votes to\nadd to them. After the votes are counted, and if the\nresult is close, the election agents are told the results\nand have the opportunity to ask for a recount. This\nhappened in Bayswater, one of the first wards to be\ncounted. Then the results are announced by the\nReturning Officer from a microphone in the middle of\nthe floor.\nThe counters sit facing outward at tables arranged\nin a large rectangle. While they are counting, the\nobservers stand on the other side of the table.\nObservers are not supposed to talk to the counters,\nexcept to point out any mistakes in allocating papers\nto the boxes. I seemed to be spending most of my\ntime rescuing votes for the Liberal Democrats from\nthe Conservative box.\nWhen the results are announced, the observers\nfrom a particular party usually cheer their candidates\nif they think they've won. The Labour cheers were\nexultant and joyful and they clapped and stamped\ntheir feet. The Conservative cheers were altogether\ndifferent and disturbing: they had an element of small\nschoolboy rivalry or football hooliganism about them.\nThe subtext implied 'We stuffed the opposition' and\nseemed very ugly in comparison. The whole election\ncount experience left me with the impression that\nConservatives en masse are some of the most horrible\npeople in the world.\nWe didn't think we'd win, and we didn't think we\ncould put up much of a cheer, as there were only four\nof us compared to more than a hundred Conservative\nsupporters. However we promised each other that we\nwould cheer if we got over four hundred votes,\nbelieving we'd got a little less than that. When John\nFinley's name was announced with 420 votes, we\nmanaged to raise a jubilant shout. I'm sure the rest\nof the nearly silent hall thought we were completely\nmad.\nThe two Conservatives were returned with around\n850 votes, while Chris Owen also got more than 400\nvotes. We were easily the second party, with the\nnearest candidate, from the Labour Party, receiving\n100 votes. We left soon after the Knightsbridge result\nwas announced. Lady Shirley Porter, Leader of the\nCouncil and the Conservatives, was flouncing around,\ntrailing crowds of pressmen behind her. The shot of\nher draped over the ballot boxes like a movie star,\nwhich appeared on the front cover of the Evening\nStandard, was typical of her behaviour throughout the\nmorning.\nThe news from the Kensington and Chelsea count\nwas less good. Ken and Paula Young had only\nmanaged seventh and eighth out of thirteen, behind\nboth the Conservative and the Liberal Democrat\ncandidates. Some of this could be blamed on the fact\nthat the Liberals were a much stronger second party\nand some on the fact that a smaller proportion of\nstudents were eligible to vote than in Knightsbridge.\nSo, what did we achieve? Well, we didn't get our\ncandidates elected, but we can still feel quite proud\nof ourselves. We got 60% of the students in Princes\nGardens to turn out and vote. Since the overall turnout\nwas 50%, this means we got more of 'our' electorate\nout than the Conservatives did of 'their' support. We\nalso proved it is possible to mobil is e the students on\nmajor issues and disproved the tag that we're all\napathetic. We got 30% of the votes cast and were\nclearly the second party. We scared the Conservatives\nout off their smug indifference and made them fight\nto keep a seat they seemed to think was theirs by\ndivine right.\nPerhaps they really will come and talk to us and find\nout what we want. Perhaps the next time we apply\nfor a bar licence or planning permission for a new hall\nof residence, our local councillors will provide us with\na voice on our local council. If we've achieved that,\nthen we really have achieved something.\nPage 15\n\n"

    "content": "SplotSoc splat the reds\nOn April 29 Splot Soc's postponed trip to Premier\nPaintball on the Kent coast took place. After exams,\nstorms and flood we were finally there, and with\nperfect weather. Well, almost perfect. John Preston\nwas forced to remove his c ammo jacket and play in\na rather conspicuous white t shirt. Splot Soc was split\ninto two teams, red and yellow, at eight and seven\nplayers.\nGame one saw both sides make an unsettled start.\nLuke Morales of the reds achieved the distinction of\nthe first player to be killed on the day. After some time\nthe reds made a breakthrough and Karl Gill returned\nthe flag. Game two, played on the same area, had the\nyellows make a hesitant attack which soon collapsed\nas Gavin Watson returned the flag for the reds.\nGame three was played in trenches, with a stream\nseparating the sides. A stalemate developed, but the\nlate capture of a bridge allowed Lester Lim to return\nthe flag for the reds. Game four, also in the trenches,\nlooked like becoming a certain win for the yellows.\nWarren Hurst captured the red flag, but was shot\nreturning it. Some lucky long range shots by the reds\nthen evened the sides and reduced the game to a race\nbetween Gavin Watson (R) and Pat Hall (Y), which\nwas won by a matter of seconds by the reds.\nGame five saw the reds defend a village, with the\nyellows making little progress in attacking it. Game\nsix had the yellows defending. Some clever individual\nplay by Steve Halkyard confused the reds for some\ntime though they eventually stormed the village and\nreturned the flag in the dying seconds.\nGame seven was the 'Top Gun' competition-every\nman for himself. Warren Hurst of the yellows won the\ntitle convincingly with six kills.\nThe final game was played over the whole site, with\nboth sides searching for a neutral flag, and then taking\nit to the enemy base. This also looked like being a certain victory for the yellows when Warren Hurst\nfound the flag straight away and a charge on the red\nbase began. Warren was then shot and the flag taken\nup by John Preston (Y). He was also shot and the flag\nfell briefly to Adam Wacey (R). He was shot by Craig\nBreed (Y), who then took the flag on a final run on\nthe red base. Before getting there he was shot by\nVince Ting (R), who then took the flag and ran the\nwhole length of the site to put the flag in the yellow\nbase.\nThis gave a final score of red 920, to yellow's150. A good day was had by all and further trips to this\nsuperb site are planned in the future.\nProLife\u2014embryo research\nDon't pass this article by. It is not a pointless\ndiscussion, it involves life and death, and you have\nthe chance to help save some lives.\nThe Human Embryo Experimentation bill, along with\nthe attached Abortion amendment clause which came\nbefore parliament a fortnight ago proved to be a disaster for all those who respect the life of the unborn\nchild. Once more; parliamentary procedure was the\nenemy of those seeking to improve the rights of the\nunborn. Confusion amongst Pro-Life MPs led many of\nthem to mistakenly vote in opposition to their true\nintentions. As few as 31 MPs were present during\nparts of the debate, although the bars were very busy,\nso many of the remainder relied on the less than\nobjective summing up statements to decide their\nvotes. Consequently, Britain now has the most liberal\nabortion laws in western Europe.\nAlthough the time limit for abortion was reduced to\n24 weeks, all restrictions on the abortion of potentially\nhandicapped foetuses were removed, allowing\nabortion up to birth in these cases. The horrific effect\nof this is that if, during a normal delivery, a baby is\nseen to be handicapped in any way, including\ntrivialities such as hare lip or club foot, it may be killed\neven then, for it is not until 'detachment from the\nmother' that it receives protection under the Infant\nLife Preservation act. Although most mothers come\nto love their handicapped child, it is recognised that\nthey often experience temporary feelings of shock and\nPage 18\nfear upon hearing that their child is handicapped, and\nit is whilst in this unbalanced state of mind that the\nmother will have to make the decision to allow\nabortion, a decision she may later regret. This\namendment was passed as a measure to 'de couple' the Abortion act from the Infant Life Preservation act.\nIt's terrible effects were not dwelt upon during the\nsumming up before the vote.\nExperimentation on Human Embryos up to 14 days\nfrom fertilisation will now be allowed. MPs were\nconvinced by a report on the potential for screening\nagainst genetic disorders offered by such\nexperiments, even though to date only the gender of\nthe embryo can be detected and simple statistics can\nshow that it would take hundreds, even thousands of\nyears of continuous screening to remove the simplest\ndisorders from our race, assuming detection will\nbecome possible at all. Another report, showing that\nthe study of human eggs rather than embryos has far\ngreater potential for the elimination of disorders, faced\ndelays in publication and was not released until a couple of days after the debate. Although it would\nseem to make the experimental use of embryos\nredundant, it was not considered by those who voted\non the matter.\nHowever, all is not lost. The select committee is due\nto report on May 22, and further amendments may\nbe tabled at this point. Pro-abortionists are proposing\nto allow just one doctor to give permission for an\nabortion up to 12 weeks pregnancy. This, along with\nthe RU486 'Abortion Pill' will allow abortion on\ndemand during these first 12 weeks, reducing the\nsignificance of an abortion to the level of a routine\nmethod of birth control, this must be opposed. Prolife members will be tabling amendments to limit the\neffects of the bill, by proposing to ban the use of\nembryos in drugs testing and raising pressure for a vote to include a time limit for abortions involving\nhandicap.\nIt is imperative that you write to your MP urging\nhim/her to support the pro-life amendments and\noppose the one doctor clause and to press for a vote\non time limits for abortions in exceptional\ncircumstances. No MP will want to admit to having\nmade a mistake when voting for this bill, so tell them\nthat they were misled by Kenneth Clarke about the\nbenefits of embryo experimentation and the motives\nbehind allowing abortion up to birth in some cases.\nA brief letter is all that is needed, I urge you to spare\na few minutes during the next week. Even those of\nyou who do not oppose abortion surely cannot agree\nwith the proposed degree of liberalisation. Please give\nus your support. The address for writing to all MPs\nis the House of Commons, London SW1. Don't waste\nthis chance to help save some lives.\nRob Crompton, Elec Eng 1, President IC Pro Life\nSociety.\n\n"

    "content": "University College Union loses\nroom space - one way or another\nUniversity College Union (UCU) is to lose a third\nof its building in a deal made by University College\nadministration. AU CU spokesperson said the union\nwill lose its gym, its theatre workshop and an area\ncalled 'the Garage' which is used for dances and other\nlarge scale events. U CU caters for 8000 to 8500\nstudents.\nAccording to the spokesperson, the College has not\ndecided to compensate the union and will make about\n\u00a34 million from the deal in a 'goodwill gesture' the\nbuying company will give for the use of college\nfacilities.\nThe spokesperson claimed that the loss will severely\naffect sports and theatre. 'Where are students going\nto learn to write and act? It will kill it,' they said.\nThe spokesperson added that the gym was used for\n70 hours a week , and the University of London Union\n(ULU) next door could offer only 16 hours a week\nat awkward times as a replacement. 'We will kick\nup a fuss if the Provost (Dr Derek Roberts) is\nunwilling to help.... Students are going to lose out\nand quite a few societies are going to die.' The\nspokesperson said that the Union was not opposed\nto the redevelopment but to the loss of Union facilities.\nMr Steven Montgomery, Director of External\nServices at UCL, denied that the company concerned,\nEisai, a Japanese pharmaceutical company, was going\nto affect the union building. He said that they would\nbe housed in two new buildings adjacent to the union.\nHe added that a redevelopment planned by the\nMedical Research Council (MRC) would involve\ndemolishing some of the Union building. He said that\nthese plans were only in formation, but part of the\nUnion building would have to be demolished anyway\nto make way for an Interdisciplinary Research Centre.\nMr Montgomery said that much of what U CU had\nsaid was 'patently untrue', but admitted that he\ncouldn't 'guarantee the space for their exclusive use\nwill be identical to now'. He added that there would\nonly be disruption during the building work and that\nit was 'absolutely vital' that the MRC was housed\nclose to the Biology, Pharmacology and Physiology\ndepartments of the college.\n9 B mm\n'VHrt\nDr Derek Roberts, provost of University College\nHe stressed that the MRC 'was not committed', but\nthat plans would be finalised before the end of the\nyear.\nIn response, the U CU spokesperson said 'I don't care what he says\u2014we understand it as the Provost\nexplained it to us basically nothing can go up\nwithout demolishing our facilities.'\nMr Fred Atkins, a consultant to Eisai, told Felix\nthat nothing had been agreed as yet and nothing had\nchanged hands, though the college would 'benefit\nIC Union goes\nshopping with Dai\nThe Union Office is considering the purchase of a new computer system.

He said that the system\nto be used had not yet been decided, and he estimated\nthat the old equipment would be sold off at \u00a3300 per\ncomputer.\nReggie Blennerhassett, Union Finance Officer, said\nthat he thought a \u00a310,000 system was more likely.\nThis would include two personal computers between\nthe two financial staff in the office linked to a personal\ncomputer in the Bookstore.

    "content": "beyond the bar was male only. It was quite\nextraordinary, having been brought up in a girl's school in central London, with peace and love. I didn't know very much about the college before I came. I came late. I hadn't applied to go to university that\nyear. I had decided to take a year off, and then I thought I might as well get on with it. I went through\non the clearing. I went in to meet one of the members\nof staff, who was great, he was a very eccentric\nIndian Professor, who made me a cup of tea. I felt very\nat home with him and he showed me a lot of the\nequipment, the electron microscope that I was very\ninterested in. So I decided to go, completely\nunprepared and knowing nothing about the culture of\nthe place. So it was a bit of a shock.\nI had some very good friends who were men there,\nall the men there weren't like that. In fact it was the\nmining students who were most like that. Material\nScience were a kind of civilised enclave in the RSM.\nM. Why go into Material Science?\nN. The kind of science I did at school was very\nmodern, it was Nuffield Science. In the physics course\nthey had a unit on materials. Even in those days it\nseemed sort of likely that silicon chips and materials\nwould be more important in the future than they were\nat that time. So I was quite interested in it. The\nscience I learnt at school was very investigative. The\nteaching methods at Imperial, in the lectures, were\njust sitting there writing down what the teachers said.\nFor me it was like going back to the stone age. I enjoyed the practical side of things at Imperial College.\nThe open ended projects.\nM. What did you intend to do?\nN.I was quite into science. I suppose I thought I might\nbe a material scientist. At the end of the day I was\nto fall into the opposite direction really. I was also very\ninterested in politics in those days.\nM. Did you get involved in student politics?\nN. No, not at all. I had lived in London so I was very\ninvolved in lots of politics outside the college, so I never really got involved in the student's union.\nM. Were you a Communist then?\nN. Yes\nM. Was that known, at the college?\nN. It became known quite quickly after I was there.\nPeople were quite shocked. I think they thought I was\nthe first one that had ever been to the Royal School\nof Mines. The political ignorance among some of my\nfellow students was quite shocking. It was quite a long time after the coup in Chile. A woman, who was\nquite intelligent, was saying to me 'Oh there is a Marxist government in Chile, isn't there', about five\nyears after the fascist coup! I suppose people just\nweren't interested in it, they were interested in their\nsubjects.\nAnd when, the first time, I told them I was a communist, quite soon after that I took a day off\ncollege, a bomb went off at Oxford Circus and they\nliterally thought it was me, in some way. They weren't sure it wasn't me anyway. They just weren't used to\nit. Once they got to know me later they respected me\nfor what I am.\nM. Was there a women's group or an active campaign\nto change the College?\nN. There was a women's group in the student's union,\nbut I never really got involved in the student's union.\nThey operated on an IC level. I just, sort of, survived\nwith a much more informal group of women friends\nwho just did things that we felt needed to be done.\nM. When I was at college I know that there were some\nyoung women who did leave because they felt that\nthe attitudes of the place, especially the ignorance in\nterms of politics and social issues were so strong, they\njust couldn't stand it.\nN. Yes I did think of leaving. But I suppose I am just\na very stubborn person. I don't like to see people drive\nme away from something I have chosen to do.\nM. How long were you there for?\nN. Three years\nM. Did you know Trevor Phillips? Was he there when\nyou were there?\nN. Yes, he was the President of the student's union\nwhen I was there. In fact it was my last year that he\nwas President.\nM. So it was quite political then, because it was in\nthe NUS?\nN. Yes, but the student's union did not involve the\nstudents very much, that was the problem. There was\na section that was political, the ICS (Imperial College\nSocialists) was always the more political sort of bit.\nCertainly the students from Mines were never\ninvolved in IC Union, they were involved in the Mines\nUnion. The main union never actually engaged a very\nlarge number of students.\nM. Do you think that what you found at the college\nwas a reflection of the nature of science and\ntechnology?\nN.I think it was probably an extreme reflection of\nscience. Well, I mean, I hope that the place has\nchanged quite a lot since then. I know that there isn'ta male only bar now, which is an improvement.\nM. They have the plaque up there. They proudly\nexhibit the plaque on the shelf at the back of the bar.\nThey still have men only drinking clubs. When I was\nthere they still had the 'Hon Pofnographer' and they\norganised 'Hon Porn Night'. One year they had a foreign students bar night on the theme of South\nAfrica, they were going to draw a line down the bar.\nSome were going to blacken themselves up and stand\none side, the others standing on the other. All the\nsocieties got together and protested, and involved the\npress. Reuters phoned up and the Rector Lord Flowers\nput pressure on the Union to stop it, though it was\nnot democratically stopped.\nM. What do you think of the involvement of the\ncollege with companies linked to South Africa?\nN.I thought it was dreadful. I was involved in an\noccupation of the South African Embassy when I was\nat the School of Mines. I got in because I said I was\na student there and I was interested in working in\nSouth Africa. So it was no problem at all, straight in!\nI pulled my banner out later on. It was an Antiapartheid demonstration.\nThey showed us some films sometimes about South\nAfrican gold mines, which were meant to impress us\nwith the technology and everything. It was dreadful,\nthe conditions that people were expected to work in,\nthe temperature and the humidity. They have to give\nthe black workers physical training to survive down\nthere. I think that most people would be horrified,\nincluding the non-political white students.\nM. Would you recommend any young woman to go\nto Imperial College?\nN.I think it would depend on what they wanted to\ndo really. I think in terms of becoming an engineer,\nyes. It is the best place to go in terms of the quality,\nespecially the equipment. I think the fact that the\ncollege is doing so much military research means it\nhas a lot of very high tech equipment that other\ncolleges don't necessarily have. I think they would\nhave to go with their eyes open about what it is like,\nand hopefully be a part of opening it up and changing\nit.\nM. When you were at the college did you realise the\nhistory of the place? HG Wells or TH Huxley?\nN. Something of it. Not a great deal. Like I said, the\nRSM basically saw itself as a very different entity. I didn't find out about IC as a whole, I was more kind\nof in the RSM!\nM. Do you ever relate what it was like, in terms of\npolitics and social, to what you do now?\nN. Yes. I think you are very much formed by your\nhistory, your experiences. Being at the college helped\nmake me into a feminist. I found other women gave\nme strength to have self-confidence to do things I would not have been prepared to do on my own. I also\nwent on industrial training with ICI, I did a summer\nworking with them, and a project with them in May\nlast year. I found that a valuable experience, in the\nsense that they gave us a lot of training about how\nICI was run, union, planning, the environment etc.\nThey also took me around a lot of the industry in the\nNorth West. I was based in Runcorn. That helped me\nget the feel about what industry is about, which if you\nare talking about politics is quite important.\nM. In the Communist Party itself are you, in terms of\nthe management structure, the person with the most\nexperience in terms of industry, science and\nengineering?\nN.I think I am the only person with a science degree,\nbut there are other people who have worked in\nindustry longer than me, as workers in industry.\nM. Are some people surprised when you tell them your\nbackground? Are your opponents outside the party\nsurprised about your background in material science?\nN.I think they find me a surprising person to be head\nof the Communist Party anyway. I don't know\nwhether it is just the fact that I have a science degree.\nI think it is more the fact that I am a youngish woman.\nThey don't expect me to be interested in doing this.\nMother of two...\nPage 8\n\n"

Over one hundred years\nago, in the wake of the creation of state education\nin 1870, students were busy debating at Imperial\nCollege the purpose of education and whether the\nCollege fulfilled it. One of the students, who helped\nto initiate the debate, was a poor trainee science\nteacher called HG Wells. The arguments were very\nrelevant to the students, as they were amongst the\nfirst trainee science teachers for the new system.\nSome, like Wells, had won scholarships that were\nmeant to encourage bright working class people to go\ninto teaching. Only several years before teachers were\n'trained' like apprentices, on the job as pupil-teachers.\nSomething Wells started off as.\nWhat also made the issue particularly exciting to the\nstudents was that their Dean was Professor TH Huxley, a genius of a scientist, writer and teacher who\nfought for free schools for all. He was a working class\nhero, promoting free libraries and museums as a part\nof the education system. He most importantly saw the\npurpose of education not to train but to liberate, to\nfree the mind through excited inquiry and questioning.\nHe consequently fought against the state support of\nreligious schools and against religious preaching in\nstate schools, these were an anathema to his concept\nof developing open minds. This, to him, was liberal\neducation. Wells was greatly inspired by Huxley's ideas and teachings.\nBecause it was during the throes of the beginning\nof state education there was a lot wrong with the\nmethods and philosophies used. Exam results were\nused to determine how much money the schools\nwould get. Cramming, rather than learning and\nunderstanding, was the predominant activity \"of\nstudents and pupils. Wells' bitter disappointment at\nthe lack of liberal education at Imperial College led him\nto write harsh criticisms of it in his autobiography. He\nalso describes its destruction in the first serial is ation of War of the Worlds and in the short story Argonauts\nof the Air.\nOn May 22 you can hear the arguments come back\nto life. Have things really changed over the last one\nhundred years? How relevant are Wells' criticisms\ntoday? Can we learn something about what is\nhappening in the changes in education now by looking\nat the past?\nOne of the speakers in the debate is Nina Temple,\nan ex-student of the Royal School of Mines. She is\nthe first woman to become Secretary of the British\nCommunist Party. As a student she was a communist.\nWhat was it like at Imperial College for her? Read her\ninterview. Come and hear her speak, alongside Trevor\nPhillips ex-ICU and NUS President and now Editor of\nLWT, proposing that the College should be 'razed to\nthe ground'. You might be surprised, you might find\nyourself agreeing with her, and HG Wells.\nWin free tickets to see the martian lasers 'destroy\nImperial College'\nBy picking up one of the leaflets advertising the debate\nyou could win tickets to see the fantasy laser show\nbased on Jeff Wayne's Musical Verson of War of the\nWorlds at the Laserium, or you could win the double\nalbum! See how the Martians might have destroyed\nyour college.\nM. When were you at Imperial College?\nN.I think I finished in 77.1 studied material science,\nin the Royal School of Mines.\nM.A very male dominated college?\nN. Yes, dreadful\nM. Was there a lot of sexism.?\nN. When I was there the fresher s' fair at the Royal\nSchool of Mines was a dreadful experience. In fact\nI nearly left after the first day because they had all\nthese very public school type, male, rugby, ritualistic\nintroductions to the college. And there was the Master\nof Pornography...\nM. He was there when I was there.\nN. The President of the Royal School of Mines had to\ndrink a piss pot full of beer in front of the students.\nI thought it was absolutely dreadful. There were other\nwomen on my course, we formed quite a tightly knit\ngroup that went around pulling down the pornography\nin our part of the college. It was a very common thing,\none of the tutors used to keep a lot of pornography\nin his draw in the lecture hall. So one day to embarrass\nhim we put all the pornography up behind the heavy\nelectronic backboard. When he came to push the\nbutton all his secrets were revealed. And there was\nthe male only bar, the Union bar. Part of it, a room\nPage 7\n\n"
