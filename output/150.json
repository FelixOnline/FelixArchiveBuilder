A large crowd of distinguished people gat\nhe red in the main Physios lecture the at re to hear Sir John, introduced by the\nViscount Falmouth, and the Rector, give\nthe opening address.

After the opening, the asse mb led company wandered around the block,\nexamining laboratories and apparatus.\nAll agreed that everything was well app\no in ted, and, so far, no major grumbles\nhave been heard.

Several users of the new Physic\nblock had noted in horror that a number\nof iron toadstools had been planted\njust outside the building, in Queen's Gate, but had been painted as mushrooms\nThey could only be toadstools, however,\nbeing obviously unfit for human con-sump tion. So it mas decided to restore\nthem to their proper species by painting a variety of colour ed spots all over them.\nThe atmosphere was tense in t ne briefing room as the recon na is ance patrol laid down their cups of coffee\nand set forth. While they were taking\nup their positions to guard against\nthe blue-uniformed enemy, a Fifth Colum, consisting of tw fc of the prettiest\ngirls available (both- alas- engaged),\nentered the building itself and engaged\nthe night watchman in charming con vers ation. Meanwhile, the Operation proper\ngot under way. Armed with brushes, pots\nand \"stencils\" (pieces of card-board\nwith round holes in them), a commando\ngroup gained access to the mushrooms\nby a secret route and completed the mu x ation into to-td stools at lightning\nspeed. Having retired, they de oi dec rw paint the'concrete pots as well, just\nto match. Withdrawal of all parties was\neo mp jaKe d without any casualties, except a few paint covered hands and clothes\nand in fact, without any slr n. fene ry activity.

At Orfprff\nand Cambridge, these two provincial\nuniversities, the Debating Society is the Union, whereas here the scientists\nrelegate it to the level of a society\nfor those who like talking.

    "content": "FELIX S. C.C. The first meeting of the SCO was held\non Oo to ber17th. and at this meeting Mr,\nBrian Ford was elected Hon.Sec.\nA report was given of the SCC Executive\noo am xt tee meeting which covered four main\npoints. First, it was noted that Council\nhad requested the student officers of the\nSCC to investigate the problems of ove\u00bbseas students. Second, the question of the\nobscuring of notice boards by the cloakroom doors was referred to the Bouse\nCommittee. Third,o lub s were asked to make\nmore intelligent use of the internal not\u2014\nice board. Lastly, it was agreed that orders\nfor engraving pots 'should go via the Chairman of the SCC to the trophy officer.\njar.KaoHierson.representing the Debating\nSociety,stated that Council had placed the\nsociety in the ECC. He thought that the\nmajor activities of the society were dis-cussing,arguing and debating of religious,\nphilosophical and political issues and\nthat,therefore,the Debating society was\nmore \u00abHn to the SCC clubs than the ECC\nclub3. lt was also more convenient if the\nEfcaaidentoof dBe bae es could attend the SCC\nmeetings In order to contact speakers for'\ndebates,The fact that if the Dab.Soo. were\nin the SCC it would be the only one awarding colours was dismissed as trivial. A request that the Chairman at. the SCC ask\nCouncil to reverse its previous deo is ion was carried,nei ruc on. The date of the next SCC meeting was\nfixed as Nov.21st, junior treasurers were,\nreminded to collect their account books\nfrom Dr.Owen,and volunteers were obtained\nto decorate the pavilion at Harlington\non Nov.5th. Clubs were reminded of the Onion rule\nagainst distributing literature in the\nref eo tories. CluBs-were -as ke4 not to arran mt meetings on Nov. 15 tli as there would os, a Union Meeting oh that day. Some d lsa at is \u00a3\nfaction waa expressed that this date had\nnot been announced earlier..\nA suggestion was made that o lub s be\nallowed the use of the oo lle ge internal\npostal system.\nOverseas Students.\nOn Thursday,Oct,20th, the SCC officers\nmet Mr.Taylor of the registry and the\nPresidents of the International Relations\nClub,the Indian,Pakistani and Arab societies to discuss the problems of overseas\nstudents. Mr. and Mrs. Cox and Mr.Ng Wing\nKong were also present in advisory capac-i ties. The discussion lasted several hours\nand the main points are summarised below.\n* 1) The Hector's Sunve-jia showed that a large proportion of overseas students felt that the Union was not diving enough for them.\n2) British students,though rarely p red judi oed against coloured students,are too\nreserved or ela e too patronising in their\nrelations with them,and overseas students\nwant,above all else,normal genuine friend-ship.\n3) Some overseas students are al30 at\nfault in that they are looking for colour\npre judi oe and ascribe too many- of\" the\nvicissitudes of everyday life to this\ncause and rebuff attempts at friendliness\non the part of British students.\nif) There is nothing the Union o an do\nto combat colour, prejudice outside college where the coloured student is most\nlikely to find it.5) Admitting all.e ole lB ws dt As fi ent a,% a: hostel or running a \u2022l& Ssri&)^'\\WXjt& am\ntheir behalf .although a WV mw j mw x Tae, presents great practical di\u00abTlaultiesi\n6) The organisation of\" fresne rs 'reo-ep t ions and dinners for overseas student r would accentuate their uneasiness rather\nthan relieve it.71 The President of the International\nVIEWPOINT\nDespite well-meant attempts to damp\ndown controversy,it appears that discussion of important Union matters has\ncontinued unabated. The Rover or ew have\nrecently voted 12-11 against wearing trousers \u00abt one of the most heated meetings\nyet helm a tI.C. Soon, the Socialist Society will be the government at an I.C, mock Parliament, and will be led as Prime\nMinister by the. only pro-Saitakellite in the society. The Debating Society,placed\nagainst its will in the Recreational Clubs\nCommittee,have received unexpected support\nfrom the Social Club-* Committee wh i oh. decided un anu aou sly to ask for the ret urs of the Debating Society to the S. C.C. The publication of the deliberations\nof Council in Felix was a welcome improve\ne ment on previous practice but may I go a step further by mentioning issues not yet\ndecided?Cbuncil have rightly'' left the\ndecision on.. \u2022 the destination, of this year*\ncarnival proceeds to the I.C. Executive Comi t tee. We certainly should try to avoid\nan annual controversy on this matter.\nMight X suggest,however,that any member\nof the Union with strong views on this\nsubject, see members of the Executive Xu\nadvance? This should ensure that the\ndecision this year is not completely at\nvariance with the wishes of Union me mb ers,even if unsatisfied customers still exist.\nAnotner issue to be decided soon,this\ntime by Counoil, is whether t tev^ \u00a3>nae aber s should have to pay for casual use of\nthe tennis courts. The present practice\nin all other sports la' that a membership\nTee Is charged by all o luD s and this fee entitles the member to the use of\nthe appr opiate facilities. The situate\nion is a little different for the tennis\ncourts(and squash presumably)where a very\nhigh proportion of the users of the courts\nmay only play one or two games per year.\nIt has been suggested that the tennis\ncourts should be considered as a recreational facility of the Union just like\nthe television room or the Union lounge\nand that no charge should be made for t ne hire of the courts. The regular users of\nthe courts would become members of the\ntennis club in the usual manner.\nThe contrary viewpoint,expressed in the preliminary discussion on Council,\nis that the tennis courts,like the boat-house etc.,may be useful sources of\nincome to the Union and should be ignored.\nThe point was also made that casual users\nof the osi uj ts might act.-, more responsibly\nif they had had to pay for the pri yi leg i and that., in a x r/ case She sum in question\n(tOs max.per annum)was not excessive by\nany standard. The issue is due to be decided at the next meeting of Council.\nSPEAK NOW OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE.\n.Relations Club said he did not think\nhis club had organised enough meetings\nfor overseas atu dents recently,and promised to rectify the situation.\n8) Formal club meetings However,did\nnot really meet the desire of overseas\nstudents for personal contact with British students, and the idea was cc no eiv ed of\nappointing sympathetic and enthusiastic\nUnionmembers to be \"contact era \"ie. to\narrange small informal gatherings of Bri tish and overseas students at intervals\nI throughout the year .This scheme' still requires more attention to detail but\nseems to present some chance of meeting\nI the current dissatisfaction of. overseas\nstudents.\nBob Finch.\nTHE* WORLD OF ART Practically everyone in the English\nbook reading society is awaiting with\nbaited breath the result of the Crown vs\nPenguin Books case. The most used word in the language at the moment appears to be\nunexpurgated. LADY CHATTEBLEY'S LOVER,\nalways a sensation,has now re ao he d overwhelming heights of notoriety. Lawrence\nwill soon be as famous as Shakespeare,ar<l yet we may never be able to read this\nfamous(infamous?) book.\nThere is a big weakness somewhere when\na legal system calls upon twelve ordinary\npeople with absolutely no literary qualifications whatsoever to judge whether or\nnot a book by a very able writer should,t or should not be placed on the book stalls for everyone to buy and read.\nSurely a much more realistic approach\nwould be to appoint a committee of, say,\nqualified writers, or it ios and readers to\njudge su oha work.\nLet us hope,anyway,that the case goes\nto Penguin Books giving us the opportunity\nto judge for ourselves.\nMuriel Sparke has just produced another\nbook called \"The Baohelors.\"(price 16/-)\nDissapointingly,it falls sadly short of\nher previous book,that very successful and\namusing novel,\"The Ballad of Peckham Eye.\"\nIn her latest attempt,she again chooses to\nhighlight a particular section of the Community; this time the bachelor society of\nKensington,Chelsea and Hampstead.\nShe never quite finds or keeps the\no sphere of these districts and this gives\nthe story rather a hollow ring, the personalities of a couple of the main characters have been built up quite satisfactorily, but the secondary characters are\nrather weak, due to only, one short description of each at the time of entry into the\naction.\nThe plot of the novel centres round a group of spiritualists and,particularly,\ntheir medium,who is on a charge of forgery\nand fraudulent conversion. Intrigue sprouts\neverywhere,even in t erupting the bachelors'\nsearch for free love and meals.\nThe story is sufficiently involved to\nhold the readers interest,but never quite\nreaches the point where the reader cannot\nput the book down. Miss Sparks lively s tyl relies mainly on dialogue,which is both\nwitty and amusing,and never boring.However,\nin this book she has not managed, to bring\nthe reader into the story and make him\nreally care what is going to hfl r pen. One\nmore or leas feels like a disinterested\noutsider being told about friends of\nfriends.\nOn the whole,a rather diss a pointing follower to her previous book,but one well\nworth reading,at least to the keen reader.\nTo finish,there are three interesting\nPenguins published this month that are\nworth buying.Two are by William Faulkner;\n\"INTEUDEE IN THE DUST.\"and \"LIGHT IN AUGUST\"\nThe first is about the colour problem\nin the southern states of America,and the\nstory is treated as a thriller with murder\nand a lynch mob included. Intelligent and\nexciting.\nThe second,a truly great novel,aaa is with the pride,lust,hatred and brutality of a Calvinist society.\nAs ao on tra st, \"FUETHEB FABLES FOR OUR\nTIME.\"by James Thurber,for Thurberites\nonly.\nU Gibi on.

Tarte.\nFree Speech We have recieved the following letter from George Bacynski,who left last year\nwith a degree in Chemical Engineering and\nis now doing a postgraduate course at Perdue University.\nDear Jim,\nSince I 've only been here about\nt br \u00abe weeks,I shouldn'tin all fairness,\ntry and draw any conclusion from what I 've\nexperienced of University life on this\nside of the Atlantic.\nWhat Is hall do first of all,then,is\nto describe Purdue University to you,and\nthen give you my first impressions of the\nplace.(I warn you,though,that I disclaim,\nany responsibility for any legal proceed*,\nin gs rising out of the contents, of these\nletters,and that in the event of ay being\nsubpoena l by the Senate Investigation SubCommittee,I expect Felix to pay for the\nbest lawyer Ioan get.)Well,here goes!\nPurdue University is located in the\ntownship of West Lafayette,across, the\nWabash river from the parent town of lef ayette,and about 120 miles south of Chicago. The University is situated ek cao cam j uiA^ approximately 360 acres in area,but\nthe 70 or so main (educational) buildings\nare concentrated in a strip lA mile wide\nand! mile long. The remaining 200 acres\nare devoted principally to halls of residence for students, and recreational.' fac-ili ties, Perdue is a large University by English\nstandards, although it is ranked only 15thin size in the States.It has about 20,000\nstudents of w hio h^ab but1/ j are post grad-u at es. The main fields of special is ation, roughly in order of importance,'are:-Science and Engineering, Agriculture,\nEducation and the Humanities,and Home Economics.\nNow that I 've set the so en e,I'd. better\ngive some idea of what it's like to be at\nPerdue. In the first place,I was struck by\nthe. size, London University is so spread\nout that it is very difficult to v sua lise it as a whole. Here everything is concentrated in a small area, and as you look \u2022\naround all you can see(or so its eet as j is row after row of very large four or five a j tory red-brick .buildings. Perdue bs s,o6. course,op e important advantage over London in that,being compact,there is no\nwasteful duplication of facilities, and one large building about the size of the\nHoderic Hill building,is usually sufficient\nto hold a complete department.\nThe second thing I noticed was the informality of the relationship between staff\nand students. For example,a few days ago\nthe staff of the Chemical Engineering department invited new graduate students to\na picnic( I should say, in passing,that pio-nio ing(?) is every popular weekend pastime\nin the 3tates, but it has been so oom me rota lia ed that it bears little resemblance to\npie nio l rig in England,apart fr Em the fact\nthat one eats out of doors.) After the\nmeal,the staff challenged the students to\na game of softball(a cross between base-ball and rounders.)That they got soundly\nfce a teh in the end was due mostly to the\nshortness of breath rather than as a ak to#3 skill band they were on level terms,\nfor most of the game thanks to some fine\npitching by the head of the department,\nwhose curving deliveries were very hard to\nhit. Io ou ld n't imagine this sort of thins,\nhappening'at Imperial College^or any other\nEnglish Bniversity and in many;ways I think it's a pity because everyone enjoyed\nthemselves,and it broke the ice in no uncertain manner.\nFinally I suppose I'd better say something about Perdue traditions. These are\nmany and varied,and are always-being thrust\ndown our throats(when I say \"ours\" I'm including myself among the Freshmen.). I had\nheard it said quite often that Americans\nwere o on cio u a of Itheir lack of traditions,\nbut it wasn't until I got here the tI realised fully what was meant. They have many\ntraditions over here,but,although everyone\ngoes through the motions,one gets the impression that their-traditions are slight-ly ridiculous,and that they are slightly\nashamed of themselves for going through\nthe motions but that they are taking courage in nu moers. Now I'm not a rabid nation-a list, and I'm willing to admit that many\nEnglish traditions are now slightly ridiculous. The big difference is that very few\nEnglish traditions started out by being\nridiculous from the very moment of their\ninception.\nWell,I 've opened my mouth,and I.'. ve put\nary foot in it up to the knee, so I think\nthis would be a good point to finish. All the best!\nGeorge Bacynski.\nDear Sir, May I, through the col u/ ms of your\npaper, enquire if any a ej j her s of I.C. would be interested in forming an Qrni>\ntho logi o al Society within the college.\nMany universities in the count rv have\nmade valuable contributions to the understanding of bird behaviour. I feel\nthat Imperial College oo ul d well provide sufficient people of energetic and\nscientific disposition to do the same.\nThe wt iv i ties of such a society\nwould involve lectures, films and demon\nst rations, with a considerable amount\nof outdoor field work. Such field work\ncould include surveys, trapping and rir g ing and the study of specialised top-ics. Such activities could even be arranged on an expedition scale.\nContact would be established with\nother societies in this oo un try and ab-road, and the publication of reports\njp hul d further- our interests, and one\nw^u ld hope, reputation.\nIf anyone is interested in such a. aoc ie ty would they contact me via the\nUnion Rack, in order to co-ordinate efforts and he no e resort to the usual off\nio i al channels.\nl ours faithfully, Roger G. Thompson.\nDear Sir, there must surely come a time\nwhen a man having passed his prime and the\ninevitable quiet shadows of the lull after\nthe storm appear,looks at the mirror and\nsays to himself \" I have had my say,done\nmy bit, let the young new members take\nover.\"This man would remember the pathetic\npio ture of an elder statesman jeeringly\nrejected by the youngsters who grew tired\nof that interference that so annoyed him\nearlier. Some suo h are amongst us,having\nserved u. political and sporting court\njesters \"for many years ana last year\" very\nably as chairmen of the various committees.\nOne o an only hope that the discrimination\nthat comes with the years will allay the\nlikelihood of an unnecessarily distaste-ful experience. Please Sirs,thank you\" we\nsay,but please put your pens in your poe-i ets and leave it to us.\nYours Faithfully, A.

Although\nwe have a membership,non-members are\nwarmly we loomed at any of our meetings.\nWe should be glad if you would be so\nkind as to publish this letter in order\nto correct any false impression that may\nhave been given.\nYours Faithfully,\nMartin Atkins\nPresident.I.C.C.

There is a first class\nrunning track with two 220 yd s. straights.\nThis is connected by a tunnel under the\nmain road to the locker house and an\nindoor 220 yd s. cinder track. Air-conditioned facilities exist for all field events.\nThere are also soccer,rugby, hockey crick-et(?)pitches,basketball courts and an ice rink.\n'The college has its w n golf o our so, where the cross-country races are also\nheld;the latter over three laps of a hilly one and a half miles,the record being 2}:17\nFree transport and medical facilities are\nalso provided.\"\nUnfortunately,as a post-doctoral stud-ent,Mike cannot represent his collage\nand make full use of all the facilities provided.\nYours Faithfully,\nJ.
