This\nevent is all about proving which\nhall really is the best at RAG.\nEach hall is sending a team of up\nto twelve people to somewhere in\nthe UK, to collect as much money\nas they can in twelve hours in the\nsilliest manner possible. A prize\nof a large barrel of beer is going\nto the hall team which that the\nmost do sh. There will also be a prize for the team that comes up\nwith the wackiest idea.\nAt the time of writing, Falmouth\nKeogh intend to go to Guilford,\nTizard to Brighton, Fisher to\nDover or Edinburgh^), Weeks to\nChessington or Alton Towers\ntheme parks, Garden to tour\naround London's police stations\ndressed as slaves, Southwell to\nmosey around London and Willis\nJackson to do a different party\ndance in each of twelve London\nstreets (Conga in Covent Garden,\nFootball Crazy\nWaltzin Whitehall etc). Linstead\nand Selkirk were still undecided\nand Bernard Sunley were trying\nfor a football match. If you want\nto get involved, come up with\nsome more silly ideas or if you\nwant some more up-to-date\nin for mai on on what's happening,\nlook out for the posters in halls,\nor contact your RAG Hall Rep.\nPlease note that all the above\nwere ideas of the Hall Reps and\nteams, and are subject to RAG\ngetting authorisation in the towns\nconcerned. By the time you read\nthis, all plans will have been\nconfirmed and you will be able to\nsign up with your Hall Rep.\nThere will be a renegade team of\nnon-residents somewhere about,\nwho will not be entitled to the\nbarrel of beer but who will still\nbe entered for the most original\nidea prize. See Tamsin Braisher\nif you are still interested.\nFootball, be it rugby or soccer,\nhas found it's way to the heart of\nthe RAG committee and, knowing\nhow hard up you students are,\nRAG has come up with more\nfreebies for sports fans and\ncollectors alike. Following our\nrecent collection at the QPR v Leeds match, we have more\nmatches lined up throughout the\nyear.We have free tickets to three\nfurther matches over the next few\nterms already and are pushing for\nmore. If you want a free ticket,\nthe rules are quite simple - turn\nup to a RAG meeting or come up\nto the RAG office and sign up.\nThe catch? Well, you will be\nexpected to collect for a charity\n(silly question really, after all this\nis RAG!). The collecting is quite\neasy because you have a captive\naudience and it gets even easier if\nthe home team wins!\nSo you want to know what the\nmatches are? Well, so far we have\na rugby league game on 22nd November with The London\nCrusaders, then we have an\nEngland Soccer International\nagainst Holland in February and a Chelsea match in May. Any\nothers we can arrange will be\npublicised in these pages and we\nwill also try to get collections at\nother sporting events. If tickets\nare limited, a first come first\nserved basis will be in operation,\nso get in quick. We have only 10\nplaces on the London Crusaders\nmatch and 45 tickets in high\ndemand for the England\nInternational. See you at the RAG\nmeeting on Friday at 1.10pm in\nthe Ents Lounge for more\ninformation.\nThe next big RAG event of term\nafter the Halls Dirty Dozen is\nonly two weeks away now and it's time you started getting your\nteams together. For any one who\nforgot to write it in their diary it's the Great Sightseeing Challenge\nand it's on 28th November. In a style similar to monopoly, you\nneed to get yourselves in teams of\nabout four to six, not forgetting\nfancy dress if you want to do even\nbetter. You will be set a course\naround some of London's most\nfamous sights and the aim is to\nget round the course as quickly as\npossible.\nHowever there is a catch. At\neach sight you will have to take a challenge before you are told the\nnext sight on your route. You get\nto choose between a quick\nquestion, a physical challenge, or\nan instant scavenge. These in the\npast have ranged from leapfrog\nClimb Winners\nacross tower bridge,finding the nearest pub and tap-dancing in\nparliament square to finding a pint of Thames water without a pint glass and being a town crier\nin the middle of Camden Lock!\nFailure to do the required\nchallenge results in penalties\nbeing incurred, however bonus\npoints are available for stylish\nattempts and, as is often the case,,\nthe Marshalls will be highly\ncorrupt able when offered certain\nliquid bribes.\nMore details about this wacky\nevent will be winging your way in\nfuture issues of Felix so\nremember to watch this space\nevery week. Turn up to RAG\nmeetings at 1.10pm on Friday in\nthe Ents Lounge if you want to\nknow more about this or any\nother RAG event or if you have\nany ideas.\nA massive round of applause to\nthe winners of last week's Pavement Climb prizes:\nCharles Twist turned up in the\nbest climbing gear, earning\nhimself a \"Raising money by\nraising hell' T shirt. Helen\nTeasdale and Bryan Crotaz not\nonly won duck T shirts for the\nbest fancy-dress but were also the\nonly team to bring their own\nclimbing rope! Top collectors\nwere Vikki Owen and Nick\nWheeler, who won tea and\npat is series for two at the Fleur de\nLys. Hopefully any injuries they\nmay have sustained during their\ncourageous ascent of Brompton\nRoad are not serious enough to\nstop them enjoying these\ndelicacies before they forget how\nthey won them!\nPage10 "

Birkbeck President in 'Vendetta' Drama\nby Declan Curry\nThe President of Birkbeck College\nStudents' Union has accused\nstudents of waging a 'personal\nvendetta' against her. Barbara\nBates, who faces a motion of no\nconfidence on 19th November, has\nalso denied threatening the editor of\nOwl, Birkbeck's Union magazine.\nThe motion of no confidence in\nthe President has been tabled by\nDavid Gascoigne, a crystallography\nPhD student and a member of\nBirkbeck's Union Council. Mr Gascoigne has accused the\nPresident of being dictatorial at\nCouncil meetings, and of\nunilaterally overturning Council\ndecisions. He has also accused her\nof not upholding the Union\nconstitution, of forcing the\nresignation of four Council\nmembers, of squandering Union\nmoney and of author ising payments\nfrom Union petty cash without\nreceipts. Mr Gascoigne says that the\nallegations 'are in no way\naccusations of dishonesty', and that\nany suggestion of dishonesty 'is\nmerely coincidental'.\nMs Bates, speaking to / CNN, said that she was ''very firm about\nwhat is right' in the running of the\nunion, and that 'people can say what\nthey like' on whether she is\ndictatorial. She also denied that she\nhad overturned Council decisions,\nand said Birkbeck's Union Council\nhad tried to stop her from\ncommunicating directly with the\nUnion's students. She added that\n'people accuse me of being\ndictatorial, but you can't be\nmanipulated'.\nThe dispute has arisen after a Union investigation into the\nfinancial organisation of Birkbeck's Union Bar. A financial report on the\nbar was drawn up over the summer\nby the University of London Union\nand a team of accountants. As a result of the accountants' report,\nfour formal complaints were made\nagainst the bar manager, who Ms\nBates says has been 'severely\ndisciplined'. Ms Bates said that 'a lot of money had gone missing'\nfrom the bar, and it has been alleged\nthat the missing sum is close to\n\u00a311,000.\nMs Bates has accused some of\nBirkbeck's bar staff of possible\nincome tax or national insurance\ncontribution evasion. She also said\nthat three members of Birkbeck\nUnion's Council, including Mr Gascoigne, were members of bar\nstaff, in supposed contravention of\nthe Union's statute. She claims that\nthe statute forbids members of\ncouncil from receiving money from\nthe Union. Birkbeck's Union Bar is\ncontrolled by the Union council,\nthough the bar manager is a College\nemployee.\nMs Bates has slated the proposer\nof the no confidence motion, and\nhas claimed that Mr Gascoigne is\na flat mate of the disciplined bar\nmanager. Mr Gascoigne has told\nt 'CNN that Ms Bates is attempting\nto force his resignation from\nCouncil. He claims that he is not\nbeing informed of future council\nmeetings, and that his position on\nCouncil was discussed in his\nabsence at a meeting held on the 4th August. Mr Gascoigne says that he\ndid not attend this meeting as his\nposition 'was not on the agenda',\nand that he had asked Ms Bates to\nmove the meeting to a more\nconvenient date. Ms Bates points\nout that the date of this meeting had\nbeen set at the previous Council\nmeeting, which she says Mr Gascoigne attended. She also says\nthat a discussion on the employment\nof Council members as bar staff was\nclearly flagged in advance. 'It was\ndecided at the July meeting that we\nwould vote at the next meeting on\nwhether union members should\nreceive funds', she says. 'It was in\nthe minutes of the July meeting'.\nMs Bates added that she was\nassuming Mr Gascoigne was no\nlonger on Council, as he had\nworked in the bar since the August\n4th vote. 'The Honourary Secretary\nhas asked him to inform us in\nwriting of his position,' she says.\n'You're pointing the finger at me.\nHe's treating the Union unfairly. He\nhas a personal vendetta against me'.\nMr Gascoigne says that he does\nnot think Ms Bates 'is deliberately\ndishonest', though he adds that he\n'doesn't think she serves the\ninterests of students'. He says that\n'the financial rules and regulations\nof the Union constitution have been\nignored', and repeated his claim\nthat the president had 'squandered\nthe Union's money on the painting\nof the Union'sTV room'. He says\nthat Ms Bates rejected a quote of\n\u00a3200 in favour of a quote of \u00a3700,\nsomething which Ms Bates does not\ndeny. She said that the \u00a3200 quote\nwas not in writing, and that she\n'didn't know what was on offer'.\nAfter taking advice from Birkbeck\nCollege, Ms Bates plumped for a \u00a3700 quote from what she described\nas 'a professional company that was\ninsured and guaranteed', though she\nadded that the final decision had\nbeen reached after taking opinions\n'by word of mouth'. She did not\nthink it irregular that the Union\nPresident should source and process\nquotes without any form of external\nor internal supervision. 'This is\nnormal practice', she said.\nEleanor Merton, Vice President\nof Communications and Welfare at\nthe University of London Union,\nhas described the feud as 'an\ninternal dispute between the\nPresident and Union staff, adding\nthat staff were outvoting student\nrepresentatives on Birkbeck's Union Council. Yesterday\nafternoon, Mr Gascoigne said that\nhe does not expect his no confidence\nmotion to be passed. T don't think\nit will be successful,' he said.\nPage 2\n\n"

On arrival at the Poppy\nShop, we were all kit ted out with\ncollecting cans and the latest in\nhi-tech well designed poppy trays\nthat cleverly emptied themselves\nas soon as you lean t forwards!\nBut such little problems were not\ngoing to dissuade us. With\ndetermination in our hearts and\npoppies firmly in our trays, we set\noff to ensure that everybody in\nMaidstone's town centre not only\nwore a poppy but wore it with\npride. Of course this was no easy\ntask, considering the request from\nthe charity that we neither shake\nour cans nor hassle people. (As if\nwe would!)\nCCU Competition\nBut seriously, the high profile of\nRemembrance Day made the\ncollecting both easy and\nenjoyable, and many people\nseemed happy to pay for another\npiece of red paper every time they\nlost one. All the RAG raiders\nreturned from Maidstone to the\ntunes of Miss American Pie and\nAbba, much repeated, content\nwith a job well done.\nThanks go to Marc Ellis and Josh\nBurrill for driving us, and to\nPizzaland in Maidstone for giving\nus a discount. More thanks and a huge pat on the back to everybody\nwho collected. The totals will be\npublished as soon as we receive\nthem from the Royal British\nLegion.\nWhile the Halls competition has\nbeen getting all the publicity, the\nCCU competition has been\nlargely ignored. No longer is this\nto be the case. Following the\ninter hall Dirty Dozen we have an\nInter-CCU Covent Garden\nchallenge. The idea of this is for\nthe three CCUs to take a Sunday\neach and collect as much as they\ncan at Covent Garden market.\nThe winning team will be\nshowered with amazing prizes\n(currently a year's supply of\ncondoms, flavoured, coloured etc,\nplus T Shirts and other goodies)\nand will have a chance to take the\nlead in the inter CCU ratings.\nThese so far stand as follows:\nRSM \u00a3140.47\nC&G \u00a33,884.78\nRCS \u00a36,285.05\nIt's not looking that close at the\nmoment but don't forget that the\nwinner at the end of the year will\nbe the CCU raising the most per\nmember. This means that Mines,\nwith their small numbers, still\nhave time to catch up but Guilds\nneed to get their act together if\nthey want to catch those science\ntypes. Further up dates will be\nproduced after the Covent Garden\nCollections.\nSPONSORED BUNGEE JUMPING\ncheques due in TODAY\n\u00a338.50, payable to UNICEF\nplease hand in at RAG meeting\n1.10pm Ents Lounge\nor at RAG Office\nFireworks\nOn Thursday 5th November a crack team of Guys and\nFawkesses hit the Battersea\nFireworks display with a resounding bang. Touch-papers\nblazing, they shook, rattled and\nfizzed their way round the\nbonfire, leaving more of an\nimpression than the rather brief\nfireworks display.\nThe evening was not one of\nNovember's most tropical and\nafter thawing out their frozen\nfingers with mulled wine and hot\nsausage rolls, the collectors\nsparkled their way home having\ncollected a stunning \u00a31400 for the\nRoyal Putney Hospital.\nCongratulations to Mark Bunyan,\nour RAG treasurer, who, on his\nfirst collection of the year, was\nthe top collector there. Thanks\nand well done to everybody else\nwho came along for yet another\nspectacular event.\nLion on the Loose\nLast week'a group- of Guildsmen,\nby superior skill, guile and\ncunning, managed to outwit\nKing's College security, bluffing\ntheir way into a high security area\nand capture Reggie. For anyone\nwho doesnt know Reggie is a big\nred lion and the Mascot of King's College, weighing 6001bs. To\nsecure the return of their mascot,\nKing's College are required to\nraise a certain amount of money\nfor RAG and C& GU have come\nup with a novel way for them to\nRachel's Rag Roundup\nSo the first five weeks of term\nhave been and gone. Where were\nyou, what did you do and was it\nas good as what we did? Rag\nstarted the year with a bang and\nthis seemed like a good place to\nstop for a breather and a little\nlook back.\nFive weeks, five weekends and\nmore RAG events than I can\ncount (and I'm the RAG chair!).\nOf course there was Tiddlywinks\nfollowed closely by the alcoholic\nhaze that was Drink a Pub Dry.\nMonopoly was next and by the\ntime we had got over that we had\nraised almost a fifth of our\n\u00a350,000 target. The third\nweekend was a triple event with a RAG Raid to Cambridge, a collection at a QPR match and a Unicef collection. Craziness\nstruck again on Hallowe'en when\nwe had a Pavement Climb and an\namazing Rocky Horror Disco and\nlast weekend saw a pub crawl and\na second RAG Raid, this one to\nMaidstone.\nWe have so far collected a grand\ntotal of almost \u00a315,000 for the\nfollowing charities: Action Aid,\nMENCAP, UNICEF, RADS,\nLEPRA, Leukaemia Research,\nRoyal British Legion and The\nRoyal Putney Hospital. This is all\nthanks to over 300 people who\nhave got involved.\nSo what did you get out of it?\nWell we have given away loads of\nsuper prizes, collectors have been\nregularly getting free or cheap\nfood, trips to faraway places and\nfree parties here and at King's( boo!), exclusive incentive mugs\nand T shirts and, last but\ndefinitely not least, loads a fun! If\nyou think that RAG must be out\nof ideas by now be assured that\nwe're not. We still have the rest\nof the term to go and of course\nRAG week in the fourth week of\nnext term will ensure that you are\nnever bored. Events are pouring\nout of our small office at such a rate that people coming up the\nstairs are likely to be bowled over\nby the flow. If you haven't got\ndo this. Fifty sperm donations\nhave been specified with the\npayment per donation going to\ncharity instead of to the donor.\nGuilds felt that this would suit\nKing's Students to a tee!\nRAG would like to congratulate\nGuilds on their success and\neagerly anticipate a cheque from\nKing's to pass on to our chosen\nCharities. We hope King's enjoy\nthemselves and will throw\nthemselves wholeheartedly into\ntheir task.\ninvolved yet it's never too late so\ncome and find us. We meet every\nFriday in the Ents Lounge at\n1.10pm and we can be found all\nother lunchtimes in the RAG\nOffice, 2nd floor, East staircase\nof the Union Building. We're a friendly bunch and always ready\nto hear new ideas.\nIf we continue as we started our\ntarget will be an easy one but it's down to you, we're game for\nanything. Turn up to an event or a meeting and get involved. You've\nseen some of the things we do\nand there's more. We're here all\nyear.\nBe Mad! Be Silly! Be Part of It!\nPage11 "

The band looked\ndead bored but don't be conned\ninto thinking they were in anyway\nboring. Good grungy type stuff to\nfeed the heads of todays youth.\nThey certainly managed to get a few people. I think they finally\nrealised that everyone was getting\ndown when they reached their\nlast song because they suddenly\nbecame a lot more animated.

Some of this\nconfusion stemmed from\ninformation in Felix being\nincorrect, with the remainder from\ninconsistent policy earlier in the\nterm and the general lack of\nawareness of the 150 plus posters\nthat had been up around college\nfor over week before the gig.\nHopefully the air can now be\ncleared with the aid of a long\nwinded explain ation. At the start of the year it was\nhoped that all Friday nights would\nhave a degree of entrance fee\nattached to them. The first\nAtmosphere of the term was very\nsuccessful with over 550 attending\nat \u00a31 on the door. On the first\nband night of term (The Bardots)\nentrance to the traditional bar was\nleft free, therefore enabling\nanyone wishing just to drink\nwithout seeing the bands or using\nthe disco, to do so.\nHowever, several people\nattempted to crash the gig at the\nmain entrance to the Union, which\nseems odd as all they wanted to do\nwas to drink in the ira d it ional bar\n(NOT). Because of the hassle that\nthese people caused and the\nphysical threat they posed to those\nworking on the door it was\ndecided to remove the use of the\ntraditional bar. Sorry, but blame\nthe sad, drunken, atypical IC\nmale. This shouldn't cause too\nmuch of a problem as there's plenty of them about.\nThe second Atmosphere, which\nshould have been \u00a31, but wasn't due to the lack of staff available\n(possibly due to the shit they had\nto put up with week before).

The\npredictably brilliant women's team\nmanaged to hold off West London\nInstitute and win, with 1st,3 rd and\n6th places by Edwige, Jennie and\nMaria. Oh... by the way... 12 fell as appeared on the scene (Simon was\nstill suffering post-Norwegian\nhal uci nations and immagine d he\nsaw the Chippendales amongst them\n- perish the thought!). Their\nperformance was a little inferior to\nlast time due to the presence of\nAliens from planet Essex to\ncompete in the Southern.\nUniversities Championships.\nHowever, 'Gold Star Simon'\nmanaged 10th, Dave Knight a creditable 29th and Bill (I 've got a car so there !) Skailles came 39th. The following Saturday, 7 of the\nmale amoebas returned to Guildford\nfor the Stag Hill Relays. Bill\ndefected to complete Brighton\nUniversity's team (ironically he ran\nour fastest lap!). The IC team came\n6th out of 9 teams - a good\nperformance when competing\nagainst mega-athletes from Bristol,\nBrighton and Southampton. After\nthe race, tea was served - apples,\nswiss rolls and an infinite number\nof cheese sandwiches (which posed\na bit of a philosophical problem) -just the right food for growing\namoebas !\nRugby-IC 2nd XV\nIC 2nds0 Charing X2 nds39 A diss a pointing game for IC\nseconds; the game started off badly\nwith a couple of fruitful drives from\nCharing X. IC battled back and\nfought well throughout the first half\ncreating a few chances but making\nnothing of them. Once again the\ngame was hard fought, but heads\ndropped in the second half as\nCharing X came at Imperial with\ntext book moves which we did not\nstop.

IC opened the scoring early\non when Stuart Paynter kicked a penalty, this was followed up by\nthree tries, in quick succession by\nCharing Cross. IC couldn't convert\nthe pressure they applied at the end\nof the first half into points, and so\nthe half closed 3-17 to Charing\nCross.\nThe second half opened with IC\nplaying into a stiff wind. An uplifting half time talk by captain\nRupert Carr, inspired IC to drive\ndown field, culminating in a pushover try, scored by Mark Ashford.\nFrom the ensuing kick off Imperial\ncharged back down the field, in a movement finished with an\nimpressive touchdown by Richard\nStubbs. With the score at 13-17\nCharing Cross replied with a try to\nseal the match. IC ran everything\nin the last 10 minutes, but couldn't breach the strong Charing Cross\ndefence, and had to settle for a hard\nfought defeat.\nInternational Dribs\nDRIBBLERS2 CAPITOL( CANADA) 3\nLast Wednesday saw the Dribblers\nplay their first International match\nagainst a very skillful and\nexperienced Canadian team.\nWe started off well, they had a near miss (Are you sure the ball\ndidn't go in Ref ?!) and then\nsuddenly Permi was running up the\ncentre with the skill any respectable\nex-captain should have, and we\nwere one-n ill up.

The score was one all.\nThe Dribblers were convinced they\ncould win - alas it wasn't to be.\nPermi scored another putting us in\nthe lead but it was soon followed by\ntwo well deserved goals from the\nopposition. They played brilliantly,\nand we played brilliantly, but we\ndidn't half hammer them in the boat\nrace. Well done to everyone who\nplayed, and you never know they\nmight ask for a rematch - on their\npitch of course!!\nand 2nd's teams, and get them in\neither the Wednesday night after the\ngame, or early the thursday\nmorning after.\nI would also like to add that the\nsports page is there to report on any\ntype of sport and not just rugby,\nhockey and football.

And if the LSD\narticle were advertising the\navailability of such substances\nthen anonymity would be\npointless as the person would not\nmake many sales.\nSo to my conclusion, if you have\nanything to say then put your\nname to it even if it is not the\nviews ofthe Union, Felix or those\nwho work in such places. Oh, and\nI would very much like to have a conversation with the person who\nfelt it necessary to withhold his\nname from the article on the\nRoyal Family in last week's Felix\nwho are you to comment anyhow?\nYours un anonymously. Sam.\nCat's Eyes\nI would like to apologise for two\nthings that occurred in last weeks\nCat's Eyes. Thefirstof these was\nthe hideous font that was chosen\n(NOT by me), to be used for the\nlogo. I absolutely detest this font\nand would like to assure you that\nit will never be used again. The\nsecond balls-up was the word-of-the week and the phrase-of-the-week. Again I had no part in\nthese and it was all down to the\neditor, who was showing off his\nskills in space filling. But the\nspace would not have had to be\nfilled if the editor had told me a better approximation of the\nnumber of words that I would\nhave to write. Again I assure you\nthat no such tacky space fillers\nwill be appearing ever again.\nLast Sunday was Remembrance\nSunday, the only day in the year\ndevoted to those who were\nsacrificed for our country. I'm not\ngoing to insult the idea or the\nparticipants of the Cenotaph\nservice that was broadcast on TV\nbut I will degrade David\nDimbleby to the jib bering tit he\nreally is. It's bad enough that the\nDimbleby dynasty has it's hooks\neverywhere in television without\nhaving one of it 'youngest'\nmembers giving one of the most\nuncomplimentary commentary'sI have ever heard. His dribble in\nthe background, only broken by 1)\nthe 2 minutes silence at 11 o 'clock\nand 2) the speech given by the\nbishop, ruined the atmosphere of\nthe service. His little snippets of\nfucking useless facts irritated me\ninstead of making me realise what\nour soldiers did for our country,\nas they should have done.\nEvidentially he didn't get let into\nTV because of his outstanding\ncommentary skills.\nThe Rector's appearance at\nMonday's council meeting was one\nthe few highlights that occurred.\nWhat he said was interesting but I couldn't here everything because of\nthe herd of wild elephants that were\npractising their step-aerobics in the\ngym above us.\nRick Bilby, Chris Davidson and\nSteve Farrant (El President'e, Deputy El Presidente and El\nChairman), sat at the front like\nBill+Ben and Weed.

I don't mean\nthat they can sing/dance/tell a decent joke but most make\ncomplete fools of themselves by\nsharking the women. Some\nwomen find it bloody hysterical\nwatching a would-be hopeful as\nhe tries to convey to his chosen\none that he has the worlds biggest\ncock in his trousers, when usually\nthis is the complete opposite to\nreal life. Maybe be the\nintroduction of a new ID card,\ndisplaying such 'vital' statistics as\nmaximum length, maximum\ncircumference and a snazzy figure\nknown as L.E.M.( Length of\nErection in Minutes), then\nsharking may become a thing of\nthe past, (although I doubt it).\nP.J.

The\nfilm is a late-thirties action\nadventure centering around an\nunusual rocket pack, which is\nbeing chased by the FBI and\nNazis alike.\nThe action starts in late 1938\nLos Angeles, when a rocket pack developed by Howard Hughes\n(Terry O 'Quinn) is stolen by\nNazis who are being chased by\nthe FBI. To avoid losing it, they\nstash it in the plane of\nunsuspecting a via ti or Cliff\nSecond (Bill Campbell). Second\nand his mentor Peerce (Alan\nArkin) from'Glengarry Glen Ross'\nand 'Edward Scissorhands' aim to\nshows as we have had directors\nand casts for.\nThere are jobs for everyone.\nFrom administrative and senior\ntechnical bod s to acting /\ndirecting / producing types\nthrough to people that just want\nto take advantage of the\nsub sidi sed accommodation for a few hours of (easy) work a day. There is the chance to become\ninvolved from day one. We need a group of people to be 'in charge'.\nWe also need prospective\ndirectors and producers to make\nuse the pack to make some much-needed money before they return\nit. The Nazis, however, are led by\nthe ruthless Neville Sinclair\n(Timothy Dalton, a rather good\nJames Bond), the third biggest\nbox office movie star in America\nand will stop at nothing,\nincluding using Second's damn\ngood looking girlfriend (Jennifer\nConnelly), in their plans for\nworld domination.\nWill truth, justice and the\nAmerican way prevail? Come and\nfind out in MechEng 220 on\nTuesday. Doors open at 6.45pm( for 7 o 'clock) and members pay\njust to get in. Membership costs just\n\u00a33 and the first film entry is\nincluded.\nthemselves known (NOW!).\nHowever, later in the year actors\nand technical crew will be\nrequired.\nWhatever your interest (however\nvague) please come to our\nmeeting on Sunday 15th November at 7.30pm in the\nUnion Dining Hall.\nDaniel Shields (EE3).\nPage12 "

The youngish,\ngloom less crowd were here to see\nDrop Nineteens... and why not?\nThe support which cared little\nabout them - due to their\nreticence- I still cant say which\nwas which. The first\n(Rollerskate?), fronted by a sulky,\nlong-haired art vamp were\nmelodic enough, \"Marijuana bard'\nsaid Rob. The second were loud,\nangry and sadly, \"Musically\nchallenged'.

Alas, she\ndonned her industrial earplugs and\nsmirked American as I grovelled\nat her feet.\nMeanwhile, suffusing sweet\nfemale vocals with spasmodic\nscreaming, the Drop Nineteens\ncharged the audience, some of\nwhom duly charged the stage.\nShoulder dropped American\nfootball style, a guitarist ploughed\nthem kicking back into the mob.\nBy the time they covered the\nBeastie Boys Tight for your right',\nthe crowd were manic and the\nstage front was falling apart.

But they were actually\nfucking brilliant- what a great\ncombination, Takamine acoustic\nand Firebird bass. At least there's someone who knows there's more\nto rhythm than just chugging\nchords. Essentially an acoustic\nband who apparently sound\nsomewhere between the Cure and\nNirvana -1 wasn't sure if this was\ngood or bad.\nWhen Nirvana first came out they\nwere a breath of fresh air, but\nsince pre and post-'Nirvana'\nbecame musical benchmarks, they\nbecame just another MTV band.\nSo much so, nowadays 'Smells\nlike teen spirit' should be more\nlike 'Smells like a stale fart' -someone please open that bloody\nwindow. The Cure however have\nalways been great (sic).\nAnyway getting back to the band\nin question, 'Shelter' and 'Love\nwill never go' (probably) are good\ntracks with the very bohemian\nlooking bass player (great glasses)\nhammering out traces of Dave\nGrohl. More Nirvana antics with\nsudden changes of mood and\nintensity (believe me this is a good\nthing). Definitive overtones of the\nCure's 'In between days' on one of\nthe songs accompanied by the\nsinger/guitarists excellent,\nconsistent voice,\nAppleberry Crescent, a trio of the\nmost unassuming individuals, at\none of the most unassuming\nvenues; definitive talent from\nKidderminster, the keyword being\npotential - surprising to hear\nthey're still unsigned.\nPeter Stewart appeared in funky\nretro outfit and before long was\ndoing serious Pete Townsend-type\nGBH to his guitar, such that bythe\nend of the first song three strings\nwere all that remained on his\nguitar. After a quick change, he\nwas back in business accompanied\nby a cool rasta on percussion, a zombie on drums and some dude\non bass.\nBasically acoustic pop but with\nattitude and a great sense\nof humour, he insisted every song\nwas about sexuality and somehow\nended up mumbling Charles\nMason after someone commented\non his funky trousers?!\nLively encore with lead guitarist\nlooking and sounding like Nils\nLofgren, funky chops and\nminimalist solos - shame about his\nhaircut.\nGood, in fact very good.\nLucas\nMega City Four - Inspiringly\nTitled The Live Album Like Melody Maker commented\nlast week, they want to be the\nBeatles, in fact they ARE the\nBeatles - rehashed (the pun was\nintended).

    "content": "opinion\n13 November 1992 Felix 948\nDram soc Rant\nDear Jonty,\nLast week myself (Dramatic\nSociety, or DramSoc, President)\nand Andrew Nu DramSoc Stage\nDirector) were rudely summoned\nto part of a particularly boring\nUnion meeting to explain\nDramSoc charges. If it were the.\none and only time that our limited\nfree time had been interrupted\nthen 'OK, it's one of those things'.\nHowever, repeatedly during my\ninvolvement with DramSoc this\nhas been raised and laid to rest.\nSo, for the benefit of anyone who\nuses Dramsoc/Union equipment\nas well as the minority of hacks\nwho continually question our\npolicy then this is it (and yes it is\nkosher).\n1. DramSoc controls a large\nquantity of sound light and stage\nequipment.\n2. Much of this requires\nexpensive regular maintenance\nwhich cannot be carried out by\nthe society.\n3. Dramsoc's annual budget is for\nputting on DramSoc events and\ncontributes to the maintenance\nrequired as a result of these.\nWhen societies (or individuals)\nuse the equipment they are\nexpected to pay a representative\ncharge to cover the maintenance\ndue to their use of it.\n5. When the equipment is\nborrowed by a group then if it\nrequires setting up and/or\noperating then DramSoc will\ncharge wages (a pre-arranged sum\nfor a number of hours work).\nThis may seem sane enough,\nthough we have regular\n'complaints'.\nMostfrequently,these are when\npeople damage (eg. spill beer\nover) equipment while they are\nusing it. DramSoc does not\nconsider that it should penal is e all societies because of such\n(preventable) accidents.\nHowever, it does cost to have a powered amplifier cleaned. Thus,\nin such cases, we expect the\nsociety concerned to pay the cost.\nSometimes people say the charges\nare too high. Invariably this is\nbecause they have asked for too\nmuch. It is much better to talk to\nour crew about the effect that you\nwish to create, rather than saying\nhere's, light that room - oh and\nwe want some sound too'.\nThe final class of complaint is\nwhen we refuse a job. Clearly\nsome of the equipment does not\nrequire skill to use, and as long as\nno one else is using it there is\nrarely a problem with any group\nborrowing it. However, all of our\nlighting and sound kit requires at\nleast knowledge of how to set it\nup correctly (the bill for repairs\ncould very easily run to hundreds\nof pounds).Thus, unless one of\nour crew is tree (generally\npossible unless another event is\nhappening at the same time) or\nsomeone in the group can\ndemonstrates sufficient\ncompetence with the equipment\nwe have to refuse the job.\nIn case anyone is still not\nsatisfied and thinks that our terms\nare unfair then please note that\n(1) DramSoc has no reserves of\nmoney (profit) and (2)DramSoc\ndoes not spend large sums on new\nequipment at the end of the\nfinancial year.\nRegards,\nDaniel Shields (EE3).\nOpen Speech Dear Editor type bod,\nThere is nothing to be said that\ncannot be said to someone's face\nand therefore there is no need to\nwrite anonymous articles to Felix,\nclaiming that it would damage\ntheir character/life if people knew\nwho it was. If it is that\ncontroversial and dangerous then\nperhaps it should not be said. I hardly feel that the police would\nbarge into the house of the person\nwho wrote the article about LSD\nand arrest him for possession,\ndealing or general ignorance\nwithout evidence and as he states\nthat he personally has never ever\ntaken the substance himself. I think that he is in no real danger.\nSo too to the person who wrote\nthe IRA Beit Back. Does he really\nfeel that th^y would now\ndeliberately plant abo nib in his\nneighbourhood just to blow him\nup during his next yoghurt\nrun...mind you, for those of us\nwho know who this person is it\nwouldn't be such a bad idea!\nAnonymity is only really needed\nrags\nHack Attack\nDear Jonty,\nWhen I first came to Imperial, I swore that I would participate\nfully in college life during my\ntime here, and I have, being\ninvolved in the Union, my\ndepartment, the CCLPs, hey, I even wrote something for Felix!\nCall me a hack but I still behold\none group of people in utter\namazement.\nIf I try and imagine explaining\ntheir activities to a stranger to the\nCollege it would go something\nlike this; this group of people sit\nin a large smelly room, all day\nand night for weeks on end\nperiodically churning out the\nbumper edition of the self\ngratifying 'student newspaper'\n(sic). It's called Felix.\nWhat is so distressing about this\nseemingly trivial activity is the\ncharacteristics it brings out in\nthose involved. The activities of\nthe Felix hack', said or otherwise,\ntake over the poor life of the\nindividual, and often their degree!\nShe or he cannot talk about\nanything else and if two of them\nmeet heaven help us.\nThe Felix hack will risk life and\nlimb to save his/her precious rag\nfrom harm and develops strange\nantagonisms to people or\norganisations he/she has never\nmet before. See the sinister side\nemerging - Rambo-esque attacks\nof journalistic brutality, self-righteous cutting editorials, the\nsame stuff EVERY year!\nHonestly, it is in the Editor's job\ndescription, he HAS to do it.\nEight or more obligatory attacks\non the Sabbs (or Sadds as he will\ncall them), the Bar (6p for a pint,\nFAACK! where do the profits\ngo?, the CCUs ('tin-pot\ndictatorships of banana republics'\n- like Felix? No, honest.), College\nmanagement (he might have a point here.), censorship and\nmascot ry. We've had the last one\nof the list, what's the next? 5-1 on \u2022\nthe CCUs, 3-1 on the s a bbs( Dom\n- watch your back!!).\nIt is not as if the College crawls\nwith these people but it is their\nviews you are reading in that 10\no 'clock lecture on Friday morning.\nTo coin a phrase, ' Never has so\nmuch been done by so few to so\nlittle effect.'\nBut what's the motivation?\nFucked if I know.\nAnd now, in true Felix-editor\nstyle, I declare this subject closed\nbefore it gets boring and no\nbecause I want the last word, you\nwouldn't do that would you,\nJonty?\nPurr on man, the cat cuts both\nways,\nAndy Wensley, (Sad hack\nextra ordinaire and all-round\n'good egg')\nDear Jonty\nIn your editorial about mascot ry in Felix 947 you refer to\nBroadsheet and Guildsheet\n'lovingly devoting pages to this\ninane sport'. This puzzled me a little. I cannot speak for\nGuildsheet, but on a quick look\nthrough last year's Broadsheets I could only find three and a half\nsides on the subject in twelve\nissues - and one and a half of\nthose were a reaction to the\nstealing of Theta by ex-students\n(surely that counts as\nnewsworthy). This year, with\nMax and I as editors, there has so\nfar been a total of one side of A4\nabout mascot ry( and that only\nbecause it wasnt mentioned in\nthe handbook) - funnily enough,\nexactly the same amount of space\nas Felix has used this year\nenabling individuals to promote\nthe use of illegal substances.\nLots of love,\nRachel Bassett, Joint Broadsheet\nEditor 1992-93.\nPS-I really like your music pages.\nPage4 "

The delay is caused by\nthe building contractors taking\nlonger than expected to dig the\nconcrete that surrounds the base of\nthe sports centre.\nThe centre is now planned to\nreopen in early February, a week\nafter the contractors finish work on\n24th January. The new\nrefurbishments include a Jacuzzi,\nnew weights room and changing\nrooms. Contractors working on the\nsite have a penalty clause, if the\nwork is not completed on time then\na penalty is charged.\nImperial College Students Union\ncontributed \u00a3650,000 as an interest\nfree loan to the price of the changes.\nThe money came from the\nHarlington Trust Fund, consisting\nof the profits raised from the gravel\nextraction at the Harlington Sports\nGround that belonged to the Union.\nThe Imperial College Sports\nCentre has been closed since mid\nAugust and was originally to open\non the 2nd January. The late\nopening has been rumoured for\nsome weeks and was finally\nannounced during this weeks ICU\nCouncil by Chris Davidson ICU\nPresident.\nLast week Felix reported huge\nproposed price rises to Sports\nCentre season tickets. The matter\nwas discussed at South Kensington\nFacilities User Group, this Tuesday\nwhich decided to pass the matter on\nto College Athletics Committee on\n26th November. Rick Bilby ICU\nDeputy President stated that he\nhoped a season ticket would be held\nat \u00a3 3 0 for students, with other\nusers, including staff, getting much\nlarger increases in their ticket\nprices.\nOpt Out Committee\nby the News Editor and Staff\nSir Eric Ash, Imperial's Rector, has\nannounced the membership of the\ncommittee charged with reviewing\nImperial's position within the\nUniversity of London. Including\none student representative and one\nlawyer, the full committee will\nconsist of Pro Rector Professor JS\nArcher, Dean of RCS Professor JT\nStuart, Chair of Enviromental Law\nProfessor RC Macrory, from St\nMarys Hospital Medical School\nProfessor PS Sever and members of\nthe Governing Body, The Baroness\nBrigstocke and Mr RD Buchan on Dunlop Speaking as an observer at this\nweek's Imperial College Union\nCouncil, Sir Eric said that there\nwere 'no formal plans to\nd is affiliate' from the University of\nLondon federation, and that the\ncommittee had been set up to\nexamine the 1927 charter, which\nestablishes Imperial College, and\nthe structure of Governing Body of\nImperial College.\nThe Rector spoke of the\npossibility of a 'different\nrelationship' with the University of\nLondon, with Imperial awarding its\nown degrees and honour ary degrees, as well as appointing its\nown senior academic staff. Sir Eric\nsaid that he believed the College\n'would be better off if it could\naward its own degrees'. Sir Eric\nalso anticipated a 'reduction in the\nlevel of College management' if\nImperial did not have to deal with\nSenate House.\nSir Eric set out a provisional\ntimetable for the committee's Fellows elected\nP MA\nmsg mmm111 On 2nd November, Professor John Archer, Imperial College Pro Rector,\nand Professor Tony Ridley were elected to the fellowship of the Royal\nAcademy of Engineering. The occasion of the election was the Academy's annual dinner, hosted by Merchant Taylors Hall. The dinner is held\nspecifically for the purposes of establishing new members, and was attended\nby seven Imperial College Professors. Transport was supplied in the shapes\nof the RSM's Clementine, and the C&G's Bo.\ndeliberations, saying options would\nthen be presented to the Governing\nBody 'not later than next summer',\nadding that 'Decisions will be taken\nin the period of the next Rector.'\nThe Rector added that it would take\ntwo years for Imperial to sec cede from the federation\nSir Eric also claimed that an\nindependence bid would not affect\nthe position of Imperial's students\nwithin the University of London\nUnion (ULU), or with respect to\nintercollegiate halls of residence.\n'We own one-eighth of the\nintercollegiate halls,' said Sir Eric,'\nSir Eric's claims have been\nstrongly contested by UL U sabbaticals. Eleanor Merton, Vice\nPresident for Communication and\nWelfare at UL U, said that the\nRector 'must be joking' in his\ncomments about UL U and the\nintercollegiate halls. 'He can make\nbald statements like that, but he\nhasn'ta leg to stand on,' she said,\nadding that Sir Eric 'hadn't been in\ndialogue with UL U'. Ms Merton\nstated that UL U may examine 'an\nNUS-type affiliation or some form\nof voluntary membership' for\nImperial College Union students\nshould Imperial opt out from the\nfederation, and stressed that\nImperial students would not be able\nto use UL U facilities without some\nform of UL U membership.

What\nthey go through there, and the\nsecret that Peter carries with him\nare meant to make us feel we\nhave shared the extra ordinariness of ordinary people.\nUnfortunately the humour is\nstale and wooden, the characters\npredictable and machine-tooled\n(i.e. they work only for the\npurposes of the 'plot' - not to\nconvince us of themselves) and\nthe result sadly is that we have to\nwatch extraordinary actor ish people being very ordinary.

    "content": "opinion\nFelix 948 13 November 1992\nEditorial Mascotry\nHaving failed to report the theft of\nReggie the Lion in Felix I have\ndecided that I was wrong. This\nmatter is a point of information that\nshould be public knowledge. After\nall, the more you know about\nMascotry the less there is to like.\nMascoteers please read the\nfollowing news story.\nFour City and Guilds students stole a mascot from\nKings College London on 29th October, a ransom,\npaid to RAG, for its return is expected.\nLet that be the end of the matter.\nWomen Priests\nMy congratulations must go out to\nBill Raines of West London\nChaplaincy who managed to get\nhimself on every single ITN news\nbulletin on Wednesday. Maybe\nCollege should employ him as a press officer, because he certainly\nattracted more attention to himself,\ncelebrating the ordination of women\npriests, than Sir Eric Ash's Commemoration day speech did.\nCouncil\nCouncil is the most in flue nci al group of people in Imperial College\nUnion. Our President describes it,\nwith his usual acumen, as a board\nof directors. It is surprising then\nthat it should become so petty and\ndrawn out, is there hope? I think so.\nAs many people as possible must\nsee what happens in side the closed\ndoors of the council meeting. Only\nthen, by sheer embarrassment will\nwe be forced to mend our ways.\nTypesetting experiences.\nDue to a serious technical problem,\nlarge sections of this Felix are not\nof the same high quality that you\nwould expect. Our typesetting\nmachine, which produces all the\ntext for Felix, had a seizure. If you\nare very bored, turn to page 1\n7 and\nplay spot the difference, one of the\nreviews has been typeset, the others\nlaser printed, but which one? A suitable prize will be awarded for\nthe correct answer.\nLuckily, the full might of the\nFelix team came together to\nproduce this issue. All those listed\nbelow have put in time and energy\nfar beyond the call of duty.They\ndeserve greater thanks than just\nseeing their names in print.\nCredits\nNews Declan, Dave, Tanya, Mi\nMi,\nFeatures: Beccy, Rachel, Tamsin\nReviews: Catherine, Mario, Sara,\nGareth, Poddy, Ian Hodge, Tina,\nReviewers who are all wonderful,\nplease share the London Film\nFestival Pass amoung st themselves\namicably\nWhat's On: James and Poddy\nSports: Jonathan, Salmad, Gavin\nPearson,\nSpecial Thanks: David Spooner,\nAndy, Rose, The Union office,\nSam, Ominic Wikinon, Rick,\nChris, Tim Cotton for common\nsense, Steve Newhouse, Sarah,\nPhil, Simon and James.\nBeit\nBack\nIam frequently accused of being\npedantic; my standard reply to this\nis 1 think you mean Specific'. My\nreason behind such a reply relates\nto my appreciation of language as\na very funny and fault-ridden\ninstrument for communication.\nLanguage has given us God,\nreligion and evil. Language has\nruined philosophy. Language is\nthe divine comedy.\nSo I think it cause for concern\nwhen a body of men appoints\nitself to the status of an\nintellectual elite and custodians of\nthis delicate little cameo; I can't help but consider the egos and the\nintellects capable of such arrant\nindulgence. I am given to\nunderstand they call themselves\nthe Queen's English Society, and\nhave acquired for themselves mass\nmedia publicity over the past few\nmonths. They have achieved this\nby tactical, if naive, statements\nlamenting the standard of\ngrammar in our Universities. The\nmore unscrupulous newspapers\nhave already made political capital\nout of this in the least surprising\nmove of the year, and in last year's summer edition of Felix', Doctor\nBernard Lamb wrote a lengthy\narticle on spelling mistakes. Of\nthe examples cited by Dr. Lamb,\n'Youthenasia' was mine. In the\ncase I used this, it was intentional\nand the piece merited the pun.\n'Youthoria' was another, as was\n'Euph', though these last two were\nmissed, and, if I may take this\nopportunity to hoist Dr. Lamb on\nhis own petard, I think the pun is\nlegitimate. 'Queen's English' refers\nto Received Pronunciation, which\ninvolves an understanding of\nphonetics, and not just Grammar.\nPlease credit me with this\nunderstanding, if not for a vaguely\nunfunny in-joke; I will not allow\nanyone to confer upon my actions\ntheir motives and their reasons for\npublic consumption, and I object\nto being used to illustrate an\nargument that I personally find\nnarrow-minded. Perhaps the\nQueen's English Society might\nlike to turn it's attention to John\nFowles, Emily Bronte, MR James, Christopher Marlowe and\nGeoffrey Chaucer, as all have\nutilised colloquial forms in their\nworks. Alice Walker too, whose\nPulitzer-prize winning novel The\nColor Purple' was written entirely\nin idiomatic language, could be\nconsidered a target example of the\ncorruption of language. Oh, but\nshe probably doesn't count, does\nshe? She's a black American.\nMy view of life and language is\nnot limited to a watery little\nEuropean province; I am me, a living, thinking thing before a human being, and a human being\nbefore an Englishman. I admire\nconviction, but I will not be\nimprisoned by the beliefs of\nothers. Moreover, I do not think\nlanguage subject to a standardized\nand rigorous formula. Language is\nanthropological, and its\nstandardizing akin tc t Mn king that\nthe invention of the stopwatch will\nenable one to control time. These\nindividuals may just as well write\nletters to the Times complaining\nabout the sun's obstinacy in always\nrising at sunrise. I imagine it will\nnot be long before we see them\nmanning guns from the Martello\nTowers on the South East coast,\nand ritually burning posters of the\nRosetta Stone. I would hope that,\nif they read this, they would\nperceive good English, written\nwith a little wit, confidence and\n. well-constructed arguments. Aside\nfrom this, I would also like to\nthank the Queen's English Society\nfor affording me the opportunity to\nrefer to them as 'A speech\nimpediment'.\nViews expressed in this article\nare not necessarily shared by\nFelix or IC Union staff.\nBankersTrust Company\nFor the complete picture... please turn over\nPage 3\n\n"

    "content": "'eat ure13 November 1992 Felix 948\nHave Degree, Will Work\nAfter all the blood, sweat and tears, what does graduating hold for\nyou ? The story of one poor unfortunate is below.\nI woke up, it was early. Despite\nhaving nothing to do, I had an\nidea that keeping regular hours\nmight keep me sane. Becoming\nnocturnal felt bad, felt like the\nwrong thing to do. I opened the\ncurtains above my head to let the\ncool breeze flow over my face. It\nwas a beautiful summer's day.\nMy morning anxiety returned.\nThat initial dread at the\nrecognition of nothing to do and\nnowhere to go. This was followed\nby emotional re-assurances: I will\ndo something, I am going\nsomeplace. The dread of\nbecoming a loser returned. The\nimpulse to do things was there;\ninside my head I was a winner,\nready to go out, ready to conquer\nthe world. But somehow as these\nthoughts reached my normal\nconsciousness, they vanished in\nthe lethargy filter, never seeing\nthe light of day, never seeing\naction.\nI got out of bed. Washing and\nshaving were becoming early\nmorning rituals against the\ndreaded decay. Diligently\nperformed each morning,\nconfirming the illusion of\nnormality. I was a graduate! I had\na degree for fuck's sake! Why was\nI wasting my life? The television\nstared at me, daring me to flick\nthe 'on' switch. I resisted. I felt\nstrong.\nI switched on the computer. The\nword processor's green filled my\nvision. Back to the applications:\nDear ... blah ... extremely ...\nefficient ... blah ... good\ncommunication skills The\nbullshit flowed thick and fast. Td\ndone this before, and before, and\nbefore. The more I thought about\nit, the more I realised I couldn't think of anyone I knew who had\ngot a job by applying for it. It was\nalways by accident, in the right\nplace at the right time. All this\napplication bollocks was just\nsomething to do while waiting.\nAll the jobs are little slots and the\nunemployed are just funny-shaped objects being thrown at\nthem. Some lucky ones are the\nright shape and hit the right spot. The rest of us just fall to the\nfloor.\nAnother letter dispatched,\nanother rejection boomeranging\nback. I decided to be positive. I was young, fit, had a place to\nlive. It was summer and the sun\nwas shining; a beautiful lazy day\nand I had to do nothing but lie\naround and daydream. Try to\nthink of it as a holiday, I told\nmyself. Thinking of everyone\nstifling in their office routines\nwhile I lazed amused me\nsomewhat. There was even a certain amount of pleasure gained\nwatching people come home from\nwork. At least I dont have to do\nthat. But there was always a tinge\nof regret.\nAnother day lost to oblivion,\nanother day of no progress. I tried\nto identify what it was in myself\nthat seemed very ambitious. I was\ngen u in ly concerned that I had lost\ntime to everyone else. All those\npeople coming home from work were yet another rung up the\nladder, here I was waiting to get\non. But I thought I had rejected\nthe rat race. Oh no, that stuff's not\nfor me. I wasn't interested in\narse licking to progress. I didn't care if I didnt make a good\nimpression. So why was I envious\nof my friends' work? I suppose it\nwas that it seemed to give them a life, one which I was lacking.\nReflections over, I looked\naround the room. The breakfast\ndishes were there, coats needed\nhanging, and I could tell the\nkitchen needed cleaning. This\ndepressed me even more.\nWashing and cleaning should be\nthings done in spare time, not\nmain time. To assign myself the\nwashing up as the main purpose\nof my day seemed a terrible thing\nto do. So I wouldn't do it, out of\nprinciple. There was no way I was about to become a house-husband.\nPage8 "
