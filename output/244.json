However, in the second quarter IC took the\nlead, when Price went up to centre forward. IC looked like keeping\nthis lead, but half way through the third quarter Collier was sent out,\nfor impeding a Kings player. With an extra man it was only a matter\nof time before Kings scored, but the manner in which they did so was\nopp n to some doubt. As a result of this there was some disagreement\nbetween the referee and Mills, in the College goal. This ended when\nMills was asked to leave the water, and with Collier returning, this\nstill left IC one man short. The prospect was rather black but Kings\nfailed to mak\u00ab use of their advantage, and the third quarter ended\nwith die scores level.\nWith the opposition in this mood IC were able to fight back, and\nwent into the lead through Mayock. The College were now hack at\nfull strength, but couldn't keep the lead In the last 30 seconds Kings\nwere awarded a penalty, albeit doubtful Mills had no chance, in goal,\nand the game ended a two all draw.\nAND THEN SWIMMING IC 37 pis R.M.A. SANDHURST 40 pts.\nWATER-POLO IC 7 pts RM.A. SANDHURST 1 pt.\nTHE COLLEGE were entertained to a very good swimming and water-polo match by the R.M.A. Sandhurst and were unlucky to lose a very\nclose swimming match, but won the water-polo easily.\nAfter the individual swimming events the points were quite close,\nIC taking first and second places in the Individual Medley, through\nHook and Maycock. Collier and Fairbum did likewise in the Butterfly,\nand the former pai i finished first and third in the Backstroke. However,\nSandhurst had taken maximum points in the Breaststroke and had won\nthe Freestvle. Thus the result depended on the relays, both of which\nwere won by the R.M.A., and di is gave them an overall victory. The\nMedley relay was only won by six inches, but the Freestyle was a much\neasier victory for Sandhurst.\nAlthough the swimming was lost, IC gained an easy win in the water-polo game, by 7 goals to 1. There never seemed to be any doubt who\nwere to be the victors. The scorers for IC were: Collier 5, Mills 1,\nHowarth 1.\nJ.R. Hook\n\n"

    "content": "2 FELIX\nThe return of MIKE\nAs reported in last FELIX (Late\nNews), MIKE was collected from\nU.C. Union Bar on Valentine's Day.\nThe misalignment then evident has\nnow been corrected and he will return to his plinth in the near future.\nWhen the five W.H.O. members\narrived at U.C. to find MIKE's frame practically encased in half-a ton of reinforced concrete they\nphoned back to IC for tools and re-in for cements. Phil Marshall was called out of a Guilds Committee Meeting and immediately set about\ngathering a team of men and equipment\u2014which included pickaxes and\nvast quantities of rope. Pook, in the\ninterim, asked us to donate a sum\nto charity for which we would get\nthe use of rollers, ropes, planks and\nthe lift which had previously been\nswitched off. This ignored, the reinforcements arrived around 9.00 p.m. and the pickaxes were wielded tor\nseveral minutes before a rather smart\nlooking U.C. gentleman\u2014D.J. and\nall\u2014appeared protesting about the\nmess in the bar and insisted that the\ncarpet was removed before anything\nfurther was done. The carpet was\nduly removed and premises were\nmade to clean up afterwards.\nMeanwhile, unknown to us, certain U.C. students had walked off\nwith MIKE's carrier and let down\nthe tyres of the van we were going\nto use to bring MIKE back. After\ntwenty minutes' further work with\nthe picks it was found that further\nwork might render permanent damage to the ceiling beneath the bar.\nIt was then decided1 that MIKE was\nready for removal.\nUnfortunately, the lift was not\nworking (the bar is two floors up)\nand so after threats to ruin the\nstairs by dragging MIKE down them\nthe lift was miraculously restored to\nworking order. As MIKE was being\ntaken through the front door fire\nhoses were turned on from upstairs\nwindows\u2014the latter action apparently seemed to interest the police a great deal.\nThe tyres on the van to be used\nwere then pumped up and MIKE\nbrought back to IC.\nNext day he was finally freed\nthanks to Higgs and Hill who cut it\nout with one of their pneumatic\ndrills. The misalignment which had\ngot worse during all this to its final\nstate of 3/16\" out over 8\", was corrected with a150 ton press in Mines\nand MIKE was then repainted in\nCiv. Eng.\nMIKE appeared at the last IC\nUnion Meeting and if all goes well\nwill soo be back on display again.\nF.J. M. Of pots, Poohs and Heffalumps\nThe SCC meeting on 15th February was dominated by two items of\nw url d shattering significance\u2014firstly Mr. Ducketfs request for a special\nUnkurd. suitably inscribed, for the chairman of the CND Croup i. e.h JJ???el t'Tl le second controversial talking-point was an application to\naffiliate a new club to SCC. Yes, you've guessed it\u2014the Pooh Club.\nMr Duckett's request for a \"pot\"\nwas the first item to be discussed.\nThe SCC Executive were clearly disinclined to let him have one\u2014\nostensibly because they thought the\nCND Group might disappear from\nCollege when Mr Duckett did, but\nprobably in fact because they hoped\nMr Duckett would disappear instantly if they closed their eyes. It was\npointed out that al thr>\"< rh Mr\nDuckett had applied for a pot before\nJanuary 1st( the latest date for ap-pli cations), SCC's Constitution stated\nthat \"SCC may award a pot...\"\n\"may\" being the operative word. The\nExecutive breathed again, thinking\n\"and may not\" But someone else, in\na flash of interpretative genius saved Duckett's day by reminding us\nthat the Committee had the option\u2014\nnot the Executive. A vote was taken,\nad in a spirit of apparently pel verse\ndelight, the members of SGC awarded Mr Duckett a pot.\nThere followed a light and pleasant in teil ude while something rather\nminor about \"Associate Membership\"\nwas discussed. Outsiders, not necessarily students, were to be allowed\nto join clubs, but not in such large\nnumbers that the College member\nship was swamped. Brendan Parker\nFORD\nMAKES THE MOST\nOF GRADUATES\nWe at Ford offer a wide variety of work that the arts, social science or engineering\ngraduate can feel is really worthwhile. It ranges from the development and planning\nof new products and their production and marketing, to the service functions of\nfinance, purchasing and industrial relations.\nAs you would expect, we use these aspects of management science in their most\nadvanced and sophisticated forms, but we know from experience that graduates,\ngiven the necessary training, can often make the best junior or middle managers in\nthese fields in a surprisingly short time. We value their enthusiasm for new ideas and\nmethods, while they value the variety of work and the intellectual and professional\nchallenge that we give.\nWe're flexible, too. Every encouragement is given to the graduate to broaden his\nexperience by changing his function: moves from labour relations to production\npurchasing, from financial analysis to market research or from product planning to\norganization planning are typical.\nFurther, we let the graduate choose his specialization after he's joined us, rather than\nforcing him to do so before.\nAbove all, we have found that we need graduates of every type as well as every\ndiscipline, and that they can all have successful careers with us.\nWe make the most of graduates; the variety of work and the salaries we pay reflect\nthis. As long as we remain Britain's leading exporter and a leader in the technological\nrevolution we cannot afford to do otherwise.\n19 6 1\nTH EQ\nUE EN'S AWARD TO INDUSTRY We shall be visiting your University on WEDNESDAY MARCH 8th Contact your Appointments Officer for further details or write direct to:\u2014\nWE JUT T RIDGE Graduate Recruitment Officer\nRoom 1/178\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY LTD\nWarley Brentwood Essex FORD OF BRITAIN said that he would rather not see,\nfor example, 50-50 affiliation with a club in RCA. Each applicant for\nmembership would have to he considered by SCC Executive as well\nac the chairman of the relevant\nclub, and economic subscriptions\nwould also have to be decided.\nThe Committee then got back to\nreal business. Mr Mackman and\n\"seventeen others\" had requested\nthat their Pooh Club be affiliated to\nSCC. They undertook to organise\nthe National Poohsticks Championship should this be necessary. Mr\nDuckett asked if this were a Red\nPlot, presumably because Mr\nAndrew Jordan was involved.\nN America Club\nIt was decided to give t ne Ponh\nClub application a second reading\nwhen a Constitution was forth com ing. Another application was then\nread, from the North America Club,\nwhich wished to affiliate to SCC.\nThe initial reaction was \"Is there\nany point in this?\" because, as Miss\nSelwyn asked, \"Is there any culture\nin North America?\" We were assured that there was. Mr Eseller\ncommented that .the-International\nRelations Club did a lot to acquaint\npeople with places like North America, and Mi Drclett said that he\nwould indeed like to find out m cie about America\u2014at the moment he\ndidn't understand it. He also asked\nif this were a CIA plot, which seemed rather funny at the time, but\ndoesn't now. The Committee decided to give the N.A.C.a second\nreading when they presented a con-st it uti on. Other points covered included a request for something to be done\nabout the difficulty of booking rooms\nfor meetings, in College Departments. It was suggested that a directory of rooms suitable for meetings of various sizes should be com-piled.\nN. Shindler\nC.E.M. favour\nfee increases\nThe College of Estate Management have recently come out against\nthe current wave of anti-Crosland\nmotions by defeating such a motion\n101-76 at their last Union meeting,\nreversing their decision of the previous meeting. The final defeat of\nthe motion deploring the rise in fees\nwas largely due to a few effectively\nemotional speeches against it, maintaining that all U.K. university places should be kept for the U.K., and\nit seems that the NUS representative\nfor the motion delivered a poor\nspeech. The C.E.M. Executive were\nalmost all in favour of the motion,\nand Mike Slade, C.E.M.' s president\ndissociates himself completely from\nthe result, expressing complete surprise and incredulity. The number of\noverseas students at C.E.M. is small\na little less than twenty.\nJ. Mullaly\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 11\nATHLETICS\nThe start of the Hyde Park Relay sees a hundred teams set off to run over\nthe eighteen mile course. When the inaugural race took place, in 1949,\nthere were only nine entries.\nHYDE PARK EDINBURGH AGAIN The Sir Roderic Hill Cup was\nagain won by Edinburgh University, who bettered their re-cord-breaking run last year by\n28 seconds, with an overall time\nof 85 min. 24 sees. They took\nthe lead on the fourth lap and\nnever looked back. Every member of the team, which, incident-ally, won the B.U.S. F. Cross\nCountry Chamionship on February 4th, returned lap times below 14 min. 25 sees., so that, at\nthe finish, they were \\ \\ minutes\nclear of the second team, Sheffield University; Loughborouh\nColleges took 3rd place. Eaiber\nin the race the pace had been\nset by St. Catherines College,\nOxford, whose two stars, John\nWaterhouse, and Fergus Murray\nled the field during the first and\nsecond laps.\nThe IC team were placed higher\nthan last year, but could only\nmanage 20th position in the highly\ncompetitive field of 88 teams from\nuniversities and colleges all over\nBritain, plus seven teams from\nGermany, France and Belgium. The\ncollege cross country club's top\nman Nick Barton, running the third\n3-mile lap, pulled them up from\n38th to 13th with a time of 13 min.\n54 sees., which was the fastest lap\nup to that stage. He handed over\nto Tony Mason who ran a very good\n15 min. 8 sec. lap and moved the\nIC team up to 11th place. The pace\nfrom this stage, however, became\ntoo hot, even for the gallant efforts\nof IC's two Godiva Harriers run-ner s. Howard Smith and Ian Jones.\nUniversity College, traditional\nrivals of the IC club, were the best\nplaced London college at 4th, with\nBorough Road College finishing hard\non their heels at 5th, to retain the\nImperial College Union Cup. This\nwas Borough's third consecutive success in the competition which is for\ncolleges with less than 500 male\nstudents.\nThe strong, cold wind was, no\ndoubt, one of the reasons why the\nindividual lap record of 13min35 sec, set up last ve arb v Mike\nTurner of Queen's, Cambridge, was\nnot broken. Mike Tagg of Reading\nUniversity, probably Britain's most\npromising young distance runner,\ncame closest with a time of 13 min.\n41 sec.\nThe innovation of a computer this\nyear, to check the results was not\nparticularly succesful, as might have\nbeen expected for the first attempt,\nand in fact it was 4 a.m. on Sunday\nbefore the -results were completed\nby hand. Nevertheless, the experience gained will be valuable and\nnext year should produce the full\nfruit of subsequent modifications to\nthe programme.\nLEAGUE W l But it wont easy in the\nAt the first full winter league\nmatch for some time, on Feb. 11th, IC proved to be the dominant col-leg e, winning all the jumps and\nmost of the track events.\nAs usual, Richard Beck asserted\nhis authority on the track commencing with a win in one of the 220yd. races, in a time of 23.1 sec.\u2014fractionally better than his previous best\nthis winter. Later he shattered the\nopposition\u2014including reigning U.L. Champion Chris Marchese\u2014when he\nstylishly speeded round the track to\nwin the 440 yd. in 50.7 sec.\nOur other outstanding competitor\nwas Paul Jones who showed now\nhe has benefited from consistent\ntraining by winning the triple jump,\nwith- a personal best of 43' 10\", in\nspite of taking off before the board.\nChris Power' was second with a best\njump nearly three inches less than\nPaul's. A dissatisfied Derek Wad\" again\nwon the long jump but was stil. unable to jump much more than 20'\u2014\nwell below his best Dave Downie\ndragged himself out of bed to reach\nMotspur in time to compete in the\npole vault, retiring, the victor, after\nclearing 10 ft.\u2014approaching his\npersonal best-, when still at school.\nHe later was second, with 5ft6, in\nthe high jump, won, as usual, by\nMike Evans who, because of a slight\ninjury, was unable to better 5ft9. Dave Dallman easily won the 880\nagainst minimal opposition, having\nmade the running virtually from the\nstart and had no need to push himself at all. Dave Everitt and Ian\nWinship also competed.\nIt was a successful morning for\nthe college though it must be remembered that the standard of the\nopposition at these meetings is not\ntrui y indicative of the highest available in the university, as many\nathletes do not appear until the\nsummer term\u2014so that our athletes\nwon't find it so easy to win in the\nUniversity Championships.\nAs the field thins out the Late Flash : Computer pro-lp n lines s increases, but for some duce d correct results two days\nthere is company. later.\nINDOORS As a result of their performances\nin the league match, a number of\nIC athletes represented the University in an indoor match at Cosford,\nagainst the R.A.F. and Loughborough Colleges, the following\nSaturday.\nHowever, they did not have a greatly successful time against these\nstronger teams, with the exception\nof Derek Wade who, in winning the\nlong jump, returned to his best form\nwith a leap of 22ft. Our representation did not disgrace itself at all\u2014\nMike Evans and Male Weaver\nclear ee6' and 5'11\" respectively in\nthe high jump, and Dave Downie\nmanaged 10ft6 in the pole vault.\nbe this summer\nRunning on boards for the first\ntime Richard Beck realised his\nignorance of this ast and was beaten\ninto second place in the 300yd s, more by tactical, than a th let y c, superiority.\nNevertheless, vital experience was\ngained and the competition was\nworthwhile for all concerned.\nI.R. Winship\nRECORDS HOT THE RIFLE CLUB are faced\nwith a full term, as far as fixtures\nare concerned. The intercollegiate\nmatches continue, and on top of\nthose there are the annual internal\ncompetitions. The College will be\nwell represented at the London\nSmall Bore Championships, and the\nU.L. Full Bore Trials, which are\nbeing held in March\nThe club is progressing well in\nthe shoulder to shoulder matches of\nthe Engineers' Cup. The first team\nhas been doing particularly well,\nand against U.C.( acknowledged as\nthe leading opposition) set up a new\nIC record of 576 points.

    "content": "FELIX 9\nCarnival so far\nThe '67 Carnival is now finalised, and a report on what has happened and on what is going to happen is called for. So far, great\nefforts by the constituent colleges have resulted in Guilds and RCS\ncollecting about \u00a3470 each, and Mines some \u00a3230. The football\npoa i has paid out over \u00a390 in prizes and the raffle tickets are selling\nvery well. So far everything has been very encouraging and everyone who has taken part has derived enjoyment and satisfaction from\nhelping the unfortunate victims of Muscular Dystrophy.\nWe have invested the money so\nfar collected at over 7% to bring in\na useful \u00a360 or so by May.\nThe football pool promoter is anxious that everyone who paid their\nfirst half share, sends in the other\nfive shillings to complete the season.\nSend the money to Frank Morris 122\nFalmouth. Year reps are asked\nagain to renew their efforts to sell\nmore raffle tickets. If we sell out we\nwill make \u00a33000 on this venture\nalone. The leaders in the individual\nbook selling competition are around\nthe 30 books mark in Mines, and\nabout 15 In Guilds and R.C.S. Even\nif you don't intend to sell any\nmore, hand counter foils to your\nrep. as soon as possible so that we\ncan invest the money.\nThe colleges are holding collecting times again to finish this term.\nLast term a fortnight's collecting\nrealised \u00a31500, so I call on everyone\nto go out once at least to collect a similar total. It is the public who\nhave got the money. If you can't go\nout collecting, sell raffle tickets in\nother colleges, halls, pubs\u2014anywhere\nwill do I Carnival week\nAnd so to next term. The rag mag\nwill be published, and on May 8 the\nCarnival week begins, with the International Evening in the Union.\nThis is an unusual but very enjoyable function and well worth the\nprice. Next day is the focus for the\nweek, the Folk Concert at the Albert\nHall. The Dubliners, the Watersons,\nthe Young Tradition, Bob Davenport,\nAnne Briggs and John Steel have\nbeen engaged. The prices will be\nmoderate and everyone in college is\nurged to go and sell tickets to\nhis/her friends. There are thousands\nof tickets to sell, and since it will\ncost over \u00a31000 to stage the con-cert, everyone's support will be need-ed. The tickets will be available\nfrom the Albert Hall and agencies\nfrom the end of March. Any enquiries about block-bookings etc.\nshould be made to Steve Grant,\nKeogh 268. The Wednesday will see\na Southside Stomp and a Midnight\nFilm Show in the Union. Thursday\nand Friday are set aside for the\nDramatic Society Revue' and so on\nto the final day. During the morning,\nit is planned to hold a series of\nmoney collecting stunts in Kensington High Street and along Knightsbridge.

    "content": "6 FELLX\nPROFILE OF A BIOCHEMIST\nMartin Wa'ker Interviews\nPROFESSOR E.B. CHAIN\nUnlike many of us Frof. Chain has had no doubts about the direction\nof his career. Stimulated from the age of four by an environment of\nchemical laboratories in his father's factory, his future lay naturally in\nthe world of retorts and chemical symbolism. It was, however, towards\na field that was to expand with exciting results that he turned\u2014the\nchemistry of living matter.\nThus, interested in natural products chemistry, he took a degree at\ni he age of twenty-four in Chemistry and Physiology from the Friedrich\nWilhelm University in Berlin and later in 1933 emigrated to England\nto begin the research at Oxford and Cambridge that was to lead him\nto sharing the 1945 Nobel prize in physiology and medicine. Prol.\nH. W.( now Lord) Florey and Prof. Chain had discovered the remarkable\nproperty of penicillin to destroy infection. Prof. Chain is the scientific\ndirector of the International Centre for Chemical Microbiology in Rome,\nand has been Professor of Biochemistry at Imperial College since the\nestablishment of the present research block in 1961.\nIt has been suggested that a scientist is most likely to make\na significant contribution while\nyoung, since beyond a certain\nage\u201430 has been mentioned\u2014\none ceases to question critically\none's previously held concepts.\nDo you think that there is any\ntruth in this?\nThis applies only to the theo-ret ici an. An experimental scientist\nis likely to improve with age since\nin experimental work, \"Experience\nis more important than concepts\"\nProfessor Chain for instance, regards\nProfessor Warburg, now over 80, as\nthe greatest living biochemist. An\nexperimenter relies not only on his\ningenuity in devising new techniques, but also on his cleverness in\navoiding pitfalls, and it is this critical attitude to one's work that grows\nwith age. However, he agrees that\n\"The biggest enemy of experimental\nor theoretical science is the acceptance of established schemes of whatever nature' It is unfortunate that\nstudents do not like the idea that\nconcepts they learn will often have\nto be revised maybe even before\nthey finish their studies, and lecturers who emphasise too much the\nephemeral nature of schemes presented as final solutions in their text-books, are not popular.\nWhat interests do you have outside biochemical research?\nProfessor Chain is an accomplished pianist; his special interest is\nchamber music. He also reads wi d ely, enjoy ig travel books and bio-graph ies. When I asked him if he read any\ntechnical literature outside his own\nfield, we got on to the topic of the\nenormous proliferation of published\nscientific papers. He estimated that\nbetween 20 and 30 thousand pages\na year at least were produced in\nbiochemistry alone. Thus, \"One can\nnever be competent in more than an\nsmall field. However, no man can\naccomplish more work than any one\nman is capable of carrying out, and\none should not be unduly frightened\nby the numbers of people working\nin one's own field\" He cited as an\nexample the four thousand people\nemployed in radio biological work at\nOak Ridge in the US... but, \"Pro-vi ded the facilities are equally good,\none has an equal chance. It is the\nindividual who counts.\"\nWhat is biochemistry? What are\nits general aims?\nBiochemistry is concerned with\nthe study of the mechanisms of the\nchemical reactions, functions and\nstructure of the components of living\nmatter, animals, plants and micro-organisms.\nThe practical aim of biochemist iy is to discover methods of treatment\nof disease, infectious and metabolic,\nby means of chemical substances.\nOne of the most important problems\nin the realm of metabolic diseases is\nthe study of regulatory mechanism.\nBiochemistry has also important applications in agriculture; the development of plant growth hormones,\nweed killers and pesticides are typical examples. Other examples are\nthe study of nitrogen fixation by soil\nbacteria, photosynthesis, interactions\nbetween plaints micro-organisms etc.\netc.\nDo you think that after the recent rapid advances in biochemistry and molecular biology,\nresearch will now slow down, or\ndo you envisage more rapid progress ?\nThe big spurt in molecular biology\u2014which at least in part is the\nmodern version of natural products\nchemistry\u2014is over, at least, as far\nas novel concepts are concerned.\nHowever, a vast amount of work on\nmacromolecules of all kinds remains\nto be done with the known techniques, and such studies will undoubtedly lead to interesting results.\nGreater knowledge for instance, of\namino acid sequence and spatial configuration of- proteins\u2014and there\nare thousands of these to be investigated\u2014will lead to a better understanding of their function, catalytic-al as well as structural components\nof the cell. The same applies of\ncourse, to nucleic acids; our knowledge of their structure is as yet\nvery incomplete, despite all the progress made. However, it should be\nremembered that there are many\nother aspects to biochemical re-search, apart from molecular biology.\nWe are bound to mal re imp n tint discoveries in the course of study of\nthe chemical functions of intact\norganisms\u2014this approach has been\nneglected to our great disadvantage\nin favour of the study of all free\nextracts of molecular fractions.\nMany non-biologists are very interested in the question as to\nwhether it will ever be possible\nto synthesize living organic matter from non-organic compounds.\nDo you, as a biochemist, consider this an important question?\nDo you think that such a synthesis would have serious\nreligious, moral or social con-sequences?\nProfessor Chain regarded this\nquestion as primarily one of semantics and definition :\u2014what is 'living\nmatter'? \"People have synthesized\nself-replicating viruses from, non-replicating parts. But this cannot\nreally be called an ex novo synthesis of life, because the nucleic\nacids of the inactive components contain already built in all the complex\nstructural features required for the\nreplication process occur ing once\nthey are joined together. In any\ncase, such syntheses are a very far\ncry from obtaining complex animated living matter, and still farther\nremote from the synthesis of a being\nwith a conscience, or endowed with\nthe sense for ethical or moral principles. The synthesis of anything that\ncomplex is so remote as not to\nbe worthy of serious consideration;\nconsequently speculation on the\nsignificance of such, hypothetical\n\"achievement\" is futile.\nSome people fear the misuse of\nour knowledge of the fundamental life processes. Do you think\nsuch fears are justified?\n\"Any invention in any field can\nbe misused. Of course you can misuse biological phenomena; see for\ninstance the misuse of drugs for\npoisoning people or as narcotics lor\ninducing stupor or other psycho-pathological conditions in young\npeople. If an invention can be mis-used, sooner or later someone will\nsurely misuse it, and this applies to\nall inventions, biological ones not\nexcluded. However, this is no reason\nfor stopping discoveries or invent-ions; in any case, this is impossible\nand if the times are mature for a particular discovery to be made,\nsomeone will make it somewhere.\nIs it the job of the scientist,\nmore than anyone else to govern the\nuse of an invention? A scientist has\nno more moral responsibility than\nany other citizen... and we have\nscience writting as a profession to\nmake people aware of the social implications of new discoveries. A scientist must have a conscience, but\nnot more of one than anyone else\"\nWhat is the significance, aside\nfrom the obvious medical applications, of biochemistry to man?\nThe significance of biochemical\nresearch can hardly be over es tim at ed. Some of these jargon s have become very irritating. It has led,\nthrough the use of weed killers and\nknowledge of soil microbiology, to\nvast crop improvements. It has helped solve fishery and veterinary pro-ble ms, and has lead to improvements\nin food technology. Food preservation alone is tremendously import-ant.\nWhat are the effects of pesticides on the balance of nature?\n\"This, he agreed, was a real\nbiochemical problem\" but \"much\nrubbish has been written about it\"\nThe real problems are of resistance\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n5\nUtUw to FELIX\nFees -two opposing views\nSir,\nMr. David Potter's emotional article condemning fee rises for foreign\nstudents dwelt mainly on the moral\nissues\u2014our duties to developing\nnations and our community awareness to all mankind. While he had\nevery right to express his emotion\no ii this issues, 1 fear that they\nwould not carry much weight in\nWhitehall. Surely, however, there\nis a far more specific ground for deploring the rises, this being the\nfuture welfare of British Universities.\nAbout half of IC students are\npostgraduates and a very aig b proportion of these are from abroad,\ncarrying out research in this country.\nThese students obtain University\nplaces by the same process of competition as do those from the United Kingdom, therefore attain the\nsame high standard in their studies\nand add considerably to scientific\nknowledge. Discouraging such students to study in this country may\nincrease the availability of university\nplaces, but as the demand for\nthese places drops, it might be inferred di at the cah hie of students\nwill fall.\nFurthermore, at all University\nlevels exchange of problems and\nideas among students from diff en ng backgrounds, be they from developing African nations, from the United\nStates or from Great Britain, can\nonly be conducive to progress.\nThe 5 million pounds spent on\nforeign students should be regarded\nas an investment bringing its due\nreturn anc not as a charity. It is\ninteresting to note that West German Universities, which, like those\nin Britain have a high proportion\nof foreign students, charge fees for\neveryone of the order of \u00a320 per\nannum, and of this half is medical\ninsurance!\nThe brain drain is already troubling Britain. With the new measures,\nsome of the potential flow will not\neven be caught in the run-off.\nHaving lived here all my lite, I feel I speak as an English student.\nDimitris Alatzas\nSir,\nin the past weeks the action taken\nto persuade the Government to\nabandon the proposed increases in\nfees for overseas students seems to\nhave reached the level of mass\nhysteria. The arguments for and\nagainst this rise seem to have been\nlost in the fury of the stampede\nagainst Mr Crosland that followed\nhis announcement of the increase.\nWhilst it is doubtless morally laudable that we should show complete\ndisregard for our English bre dieren and show concern only for those who\ninhabit other parts of the globe I doubt very much if your con try men think of others and not themselves.\nMr Crosland's duty is to represent\nthe people of this country who\nelected him.\nIn Britain \"there is a shortage of\nuniversity places available if the\nRobbins Report is to be believed.\nBritain is also in economic difficult-ies. Does die British taxpayer pay\nhis large taxes so that a foreigner\nwho pays practically nothing may attend a university which has no room\nfor his own sons? Charity is fine, but\nDue to the lack of space this\nweek, many letters have been with-held. It is hoped to publish them\nin the next issue.\ncharity begins at home. Whilst we\nhave ash or age of university places\nshould not those who pay for them\nhave die opportunity to use them?\nIt is, however, disagreeable to\ncharge the fees for those part-wav\nthrough a course of study. Once we\nhave quoted our price we should\nstick to it. However, it would seem\nreasonable to charge new students\nmore.\nI would further suggest that overseas students lobby their own gov-ere ment s to pay this reasonable increase (there is still a heavy sub-sid y.) For it is the duty of their\npeople not ours to educate them,\nafter all it is their government which\ncollects taxes from their parents.\nRob Collinge\nP.S. Perhaps a quorum of one at\nUnion meetings would enable motions supporting militancy in th si matter to be passed more easily.\nSafety\nSir,\nDuring November '66 FELIX\ncarried an article containing reports\nof interviews with the Chairman of\nthe College Safety Committee and\nmyself, as Secretary of the College\nBranch of the A. Sc.W Subsequent\nto this your article was reproduced\nand officially circulated to the members of the College Safety Committee. This was excellent, since it\nconveyed students' opinion dn ect to\nthe College Safety Committee.\nI believe it is timely to bring\nthe question of safety at Imperial\nCollege once again into your\ncolumns.\nIt is, for example, worth restating the fundamental principle that\nas safety matters direct iy concern\nstudents, they, as a well-defined\ngroup have a right to represent at ion. Indeed, a recent conference on\nsafety matters organised jointly by\nthe T.U.C. and the Confederation\nof British Industries, supported by\nthe Ministry of Labour, reaffirmed\nthe same principle. It appears that\nlegislation along these lines of\ndirect representation on industrial\nsafety committees was introduced\nin 1927, but later shelved,'and the\nConference thought that^ some ^Such\nlegislation should be 'brought in\nduring the 1960's. This has so stimulated the T.U.'s in the educational\nfield, that joint discussions are now\ntaking place.\nProbably the most important\nquestion in safety is what happens\nif, an Imperial College student lias\nsuch as e nous accident that his or\nher future life and/or career is\nshattered. We know that Imperial\nCollege is insured to some extent\nagainst accidents to College staff\nand students, but it has never been\nmade clear what would happen in\nsuch a serious accident. We would\nargue that Imperial College has the\nresponsibility to make the normal\nsubstantial cash payment if such a tragedy occured, so that the student concerned would not suffer subsequent economic hardship. Further,\nwe would like to see this situation\ncarefully clarified1 before there is any\ntest case.\nFinally, may I say that students\nshould be light-hearted and full of\n'joie de viv re' in many things, but\nin some things they have to be res-pons i ble, and safety is one of these.\nH.

    "content": "Plans for student houses\nThe Union sub-committee investigating student houses have found a way for the money to be raised entirely within the College. Welfare\nOfficer Pete Finch believes that\n\u00a3100,000 would pay for eighty places in houses and that this could be\npaid off over thirty years by increases in Hall fees of between 5/- and\n10/- per week. The committee recommends the forming of a Housing Association to which 100%\nmortgages should be readily available at 7% interest. Several other\nschemes for raising the required\ncapital are proposed including appeals to the Universities Grants\nCommittee, the Overseas Students\nWelfare Expansion Programme, and\nto industry. Before beginning such\nappeals, however, a feasibility study\nwould be conducted by a Publi,:\nelation s Organisation to determine\nthe likely yield.\nThe proposal to increase Hall fees\nis currently being discussed by the\nHalls residents who will determine\nwhether the suggestion should be\nput to the Halls of Residence Committee by Rex Lowin. A report by\nthe sub-committee notes that \"such\nan increase, while painful to the re-sident s, would not even make their\nrents comparable to those already\nbeing paid by students in similar\nlodgings\"\nThis report is a comprehensive\nsurvey of the student housing situation as it affects IC students.

The\ngiving of news to other colleges\nshould not detract from the val ne of FELIX since those pan ers which\nor in t it will not be read by members of IC.

Tel.: FUI\nAt ICWA's Annual Party Andy\nPowell, Vice-Captain of Rugby, was\nelected Mr ICWA 1967 despite\noverwhelming prior publicity by\u2014\nor for\u2014Mr Pete Franklin. The party\nwas attended by various members\nof the College of Estate Management as well as most of the Rugby\nClub and interlopers from the\n\"Valentine's Rave\"\nICU - the\nexperts on RSA?\nAs ever, the members of IC quickly and accurately learn of doings\noutside the College. In this instance\nI refer to the Radical Student Alliance (RSA). So full of knowledge\non this are the members of IC\u2014\nafter all there was a letter in FELIX\nlast issue about it\u2014that only five\npeople and myself attended a meeting\non RSA organized by the Liberal\nSociety on Thurs 16th. The five who were there all knew\na good deal about RSA and were in\nfact expecting to be able to answer\nthe questions of others on details,\nsome of them having been in contact\nvith people closely connected with\nRSA.\nHowever, they obviously need n't bother. IC students know all about\nRSA, anyway it doesn't concern us.\nRSA's main objective is to kick some\nmore life into NUS and get students\nen masse to take a more active part\nin student affairs. Not being a member of NUS this is obviously no concern of ours. We could never rejoin\nNUS. even if it were to become\ntotally acceptable to IC students. We\nmust certainly be nig-headed and\nignore the foolish efforts of students-of the other inferior universities in\nthe country to gain a voice in the\neducational policies of the nation.\nEqually, the action RSA has taken\non the question of fee increases for\noverseas students is no cause to learn\nabout the alliance, or is it?\nComments on RSA in the Press, a \"Red Smear\" campaign as I have\nheard it called, true or false, it is\nno concern of ours. Who cares if a bunch of Communists, under the\nthumb of Moscow or Pekin, gain\ncontrol of NUS. The rest of the\ncountry's students can hardly expect\nus, sitting right in the middle of\nLondon, to help them.\nDoesn't anyone care?\nK. Simpson\n\n"

IC Union looked like all those\nother -Unions we have hitherto looked down upon\u2014those Unions whose\nactivities are regularly reported in the national press, and which are\nvery largely responsible for the bad public image of the student.\nlC Union has tremendous power in this College compared with the\npowers of most Student Unions. This is the result of two major factors.\nFirstly, the Union has almost always been well run. Four people,\nMessrs. Duckett, Jordan, Boothman and Ebden have decided that all\nth:s shall end. Their attempt to destroy the excellent staff-student relations which have been built up over the years has almost succeeded.\nTheir aim of making IC Union and the students of IC appear to be\na mob of irresponsible and selfish hooligans has almost been achieved.\nOnke must take a large share of the blame for the chaos that reigned\nlast Tuesday. Not because he's a bad President, but because he is\na bad chairman. He has the unhappy knack of being domineering without dominating. The chairman of a Union meeting must have the ability to trample on the trouble-makers without annoying the remainder of\nthe meeting by the way the trampling is done. It is Duke's domineering\nmanner that makes the barrack-room lawyers of the Union so bitterly\nagainst him. Losing his temper and walking out in a huff didn't really\nhelp matters either. Let us hope that at the next meeting he can\nuse his authority a little more effectively.\nThe posters advertising that fateful Meeting illustrate the other cause\nof the Union's near-capitulation to the extremists. \"Your Union Needs\nYou\" But You weren't there. One must expect the Union to be represented as extremist if only extremists attend the meetings. A more\nrepresentative group of people would have prevented such a farce. Your\nUnion Needs You.\nI believe that our Union is important. We need it as much as it\nneeds us. I also have a certain degree of fath, naive though that may\nappear, in the people who run the Union and make it worthwhile by\ndint of sheer hard \\#or k. Like the Labour Government, they make\nmistakes, sometimes bad ones. The mistakes are nothing, though, compared with what they achieve on our behalf. I don't like to see all\ntheir work, and that of their predecessors, destroyed by some little upstart invoking the magic words, rights and democracy, when that same\nperson is not prepared to do anything more constructive than shout abuse.\nWhen is IC Union Executive going to stop making pious noises and\nactually do something ? Their showing at the Union meeting on Tuesday (the 21st) was beyond the bounds\nof credibility.\nBrendan Parker said that only two\npeople have come forward to explain cases of hardship. It is hardly\nsurprising that there are so few cases when one considers the fact that\nvirtually nc publicity has been given to what IC Union intends to do.\nBesides this, many foreign students\nare here on a one year post-graduate\ncourse and will not be hit by\nCrosland's measures. What really\nmatters is students who would have\nintended to come here at some\nfuture date.\nMr Parker then went on to say\nthat full publicity would be given to\nwhat IC intends to do to investigate\nthe effect of the new measures. Unfortunately this is going to be of\nuse only fit these measures are publicised in India, Pakistan, Iran and ail\nthe other countries with students\nhere. About this problem, the Executive had nothing at all to say.\nOn future action, the Executive,\nWhose job it should be to give the\nUnion a lead on such matters was\nequally blank. Bradford University\nare rumoured to be shouldering the\nextra costs themselves. Could not\nIC join them in this action, and\nthen go on to persuade all other\ncolleges, to do the same ? This now\nseems the only way out, since vf\nall colleges were to act united ly in\nthis manner, Crosland would be\nfaced with the choice of cutting\nback on teaching and research work,\nwhich he would be loathe to do. or\ngiving an extra grant to the colleges and universities which would\nbring us back to the position before\nDecember 21st last.\nIt is now up to Duke and the rest\nof the Executive to get down to\nsome hard work on these problems*\nIf they intend to do so, albeit belatedly, then it is to their credit and\nthat of IC. If not, let t ne in resign\nand be replaced by others who will\ntake the necessary action.\nDerek Boothman\nCEDITOR'Somme nt Tuesday 21st February surely mark a nadir in the responsibility of IC Union. We have the example of a horrifying ly farcical\nUnion meeting at which it was demonstrated that Duke has little or\nno regard for his position as President of the Union but only for\nhis personal feelings and that there is an active group within the\nUnion, whose sole function appears to be to reduce its working to\nanarchy. There followed an incident, I am informed, in the Union\noffice in which Duke would not approve a suggestion that the person\nwho had wrecked the Union bar lavatory the previous night, if he\nbe found, should be banned from the Union for the rest of this\nterm. It appears that he did not think the situation justified such\n\"severe\" action\nIt is not t air, however, to criticise the President of our Union\nalone. This year a considerable\namount of damage has been done to\nthe Union building and also to\nSouthside by drunken members of the\nUnion. The Executive's solution to\nthe brawls in Southside was to recommend that such affairs be confined to the Union bar. Is it more\nreasonable to inflict over \u00a3100 of\ndamage to the Union in two nights\nthan to do the same to Southside? It\nis costing the Union money to replace the glasses, fittings and furniture and it is costing more in its relationship with the College. Why\nshould the College give \u00a31000 to a Union which will spend a significant\nfraction of this on repairs caused by\na drunken minority?\nWho is this minority? It is easy\nto say the Rugby Club or the Stoats\nClub, but these are not accurate de-script ions. There are members of the\nUnion who drink with the sole intention of becoming drunk and who\nthen become vandals. Why does 1G have this problem, which is not\nshared by other colleges? I suggest\nit is because of example. What is\nthe image caught by a Fresher each\nyear?\u2014that every night there are\n\"men\" in the bar who drink ten\npints or more. These are the \"men\"\nand he, the Fresher, if he wants to\nbecome a \"man\" must emulate them.\nSome of these \"men\" can hold ten\npints\u2014an inexperienced drinker cannot\u2014hence some of the unpleasant\nsights one sees in the Union. But who\ncan stop this \"tradition\" of drunken-ness, who can command sufficient\nauthority to clamp down on vandals?\nThe executive. At the beginning of\nthe year Duke wrote in FELIX :\n\"At this time it is vital for us to\nINTERESTED IN:\nXIMENES\nYACHTING\nYOGA\nThen come to the\nHALDANE\nLIBRARY\n13 Princes Gardens\nfor a book about it.\nOpen Term:\nMon Fri (not Wed) 10.0-7.0\nWednesday 10.0-5.30\nVac: Mon-Fri 10.0-12.0\n1.0- 5.0\nmaintain the high standard in the\nlife of the College of which we are\nproud. We must show that we are\na strong and united Union by our\nsense of loyalty and responsibility.\"\nWhen has the Executive made any\nattempt to follow this line?\nIn the Executive we have one\nmember who is often drunk and\na gres sive when so, another who, according to his friends, drinks a lot,\nbut is not violent, a third who has\nbeen observed on one occasion this\nterm, throwing beer mugs the length\nof the Union lounge, two others who\nare sober types but rarely seen in\nthe Union after 6 p.m. and Dave\nMcBam, who is a social drinker, a powerful and efficient * duty officer\nand whose current absence correlates with the outbreak of vandalism\nin the Union. Does the Executive as\na body deserve respect from the\naverage Union member?\nThe time has come when the\nExecutive can no longer allow the\nUnion to run itself\u2014it is running itself into disgrace at the moment. I call on them to face the situation\u2014\nthe vandals need dealing with, the\nknockers need to be shown you are\nnot a weak as you appear.\nPresident Duke is reported to\nhave said after the Union meeting\nthat he had begun the year with a permissive attitude which he now\nrealised was wrong. If the Union\ndidn't like his new attitude he would\nresign. It would be a shame if he\ndid resign since his position should\nbe strong enough to be able to control reckless elements\u2014with the\nrespect of the Union and a sound set\nof arguments, it should be impossible to confuse him as was done\nrecently.\nLAMLEY'S technical & general\nbooks\nart materials\ndrawing\ninstruments\nstationery\npaperbacks\n1,3 & 5.

    "content": "4d WEDNESDAY, 1 MARCH 1967 No.,,224\nNEXT ISSUE:\nFELIX looks at the\nConstituent Colleges\nDUKE MEETING Irresponsibly attacked\nA heated attack from the floor at the Union meeting last Tuesday\naccusing the Executive of rudder less and indeterminate action over\nthe overseas students fees increase led to personal animosity and\nculminated in Union President Duke leaving the chair. A large\nlobby was pressing for a more concerted effort from the Executive in opposing the fees increase. It was felt that Duke was using\nth\u00ab chair to defend the action\u2014or lack of action\u2014of his Executive.\nThe lobby from the floor was lead by Messrs Duckett, Fuchs,\nBoothman and Mansfield. Duke defended himself by restating that\nthe College hoped to help individual cases of hardship arising from\nthe fees increase. A strike or rally would only an tag on is e the staff.\nFrank Fuchs attempted to propose\na formal motion for a rally only to\nhave it rejected out of hand from\nthe chair. This biased use of the\nchair by the Executive in defending\nitself, inflamed already raw tempers.\nLes Ebdon produced loud agreement\nfrom the floor when questioning\nDuke's right to answer criticism\nfrom the chair.\nThe temperature of the meeting\nwas lowered momentarily as Mike\nEdwards\u2014last year's chairman of\ndebates\u2014pointed out that all suggestions being proposed could only\nbe recommendations. A Union meeting had no power to decide to hold\na rally or to finance coaches. In any\nevent a decision was impossible as a quorum was not present.\nTony Duke returns to take chair at\nthe invitation of Mr Duckett.\nMalcolm Duckett sprang to his\nfeet, to propose a procedural motion\nto lower the quorum to two hundred\n(there being over two hundred pre-sent). Duke, by now visibly annoy-ed, rejected this bluntly, whereupon\nDuckett to the accompaniment of\ncheers, challenged the chair.\nExit Duke\nIn a fit of pique, Duke disrobed\nhimself of his presidential gown and\nvanished wordless ly from the plat-form.\nIn Duke's absence, Secretary\nParker took the chair. A question\nasking why only one member of the\nExecutive had attended the lobby of\nParliament a fortnight ago had been\nset down. Particularly, why was\nthere this lack of support after the\nExecutive had recommended support\nfor the lobby in the first place ? The\nreply was given : two were playing\nrugby; one was attending an important seminar; one was working and\ndie last was occupied in a manner\napparently so dubious that it could\nnot be divulged.\nWhen this reply was greeted with\nderision from the floor Oris Molam\n\u2014President of Mines\u2014retorted :\n\"Rugby is more important than\npolitics.\"\nAnswered shrewdly from the floor :\n\"This is not politics anyway.\"\nDuke later returned to the chair,\nhis humour partially replenished.\nHe was left, however, with no doubt\nthat there was a consensus of feeling at the meeting that the Executive's action on the fees increases was\nlethargic and impotent. But for the\nlack of a quorum at the meeting,\nthe Executive's hand might well\nhave been forced.\nPIGS smash Union\nproperty\nIn two nights last week, damage\nvalued at about \u00a3120 was caused\nto the Union. On Monday night the\nUnion bar lavatory was wrecked and\nmade quite unusable. Plumbing was\nripped from the wall and a porcelain cistern was smashed on the fl^er.\nOn Tuesday night revellers leaving\nthe Union after the closing of the\nbar threw two heavy wooden benches over the railings and down to the\nbasement of the Botany Department\n\u2014both were broken by the impact.\nOn both nights many glasses were\nsmashed and at midnight on Tuesday\nthe Union lounge was in a state of\nfilth and disorder rarely reached\neven in the bar. In Southside too a chair has been smashed and the\nnumber of glasses broken is increasing dangerously.\nDuty Officers\nThe damage on Monday night is\nalleged to have been caused by a party celebrating a twenty-first birth-day. The Duty Officer. Roger\nLethbridge, was in the building but\nsays that he was not aware of the\noccurrence until after it had happen-ed. One of the barmen sold \"It just\nhappened. Somebody jus' went in\nand did it.\" On Tuesday the Stoats\nClub returned to the Union at IGp.m. having completed their' \"Gloucester\nRun\" (which involved consuming at\nleast eight pints) and when the bar\nclosed some fifty alcohol soaked\nsportsmen were herder into the\nlounge.\nIt is the job of the Duty Officer to\nmaintain order in the Union-\u2014this\ncould be maintained if there were\na Duty Officer every night. Too often\nthe Duty Officer fails to turn up. or,\nhaving turn up, is not aware of his\nduties or even of the layout of the\nUnion building. Too often there are\nstill lie ht s on and outer doors oo en at midnight, though the building\nshould be closed by 11.15 o.m. Fines imposed?\nBv-law 24 in the Union bin e book\nreads \"The Council may call upon\nany member or members of the\nUnion to make good any wilful\ndamage to the Union's premises or\nappurtenances.\" It seems possible\nthat the member who smashed thr\nUnion lavatory and the members of\nStoats who threw down the benches\nmay find themselves suffering from\nthis by-law.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nill Dancing club's success\nThe unsuccessful\n\"Day of Protest\"\nIC's contribution\nMalcolm Duckett's telephone\n\"siege\" Of the Department of Education and Science appears to have\nbeen one of the few successful features of IC participation in the NUS\nsponsored national day of protest\nover overseas students fees last\nWednesday; it seems likely now that\nthe final decision will be left to individual colleges and universities.\nThe telephone siege was one of a number of suggestions offered to the\nprevious Tuesday's in quo rate Union\nmeeting. This particular proposal was\nthat as many students as possible\nshould telephone the Department on\nWednesday afternoon to offer ideas,\ntell of problems and register protests.\nTlie response on both sides to this\nscheme seems to have been worth-while. A number of IC students telephoned and all were given a fair\nhearing. It transpired that contact\nbetween Crosland and the Office of\nUniversities at the Department had\nbeen minimal, and that as far as the\nSecretary of the Office; Mrs Sanders,\ncoul ascertain, the final decision rested with individual colleges. Since\nthe principle of the London colleges is that all students should pav\nmore, this could mean that all\nLondon fees might go up, or it\ncould result in no rise at all taking\nplace. About Mr Crosland's suggested hardship fund to help overseas\nstudents in df fi cul ties, Mrs Sanders\nonly knew what she had gleaned from\nHansard; in general she had been\nkept remarkably ill-informed by Mr\nCrosland. Nevertheless it is likely\nthat news of the telephone siege,\nwill received as it was, will filter\nthrough to his august ears and have\nsome measure of effect.\nOther suggestions made at the\nUnion meeting were less successful. A proposed student strike and a rally\nin the Union *Quad failed to material-ize, mainly due to Executive disapproval, and the rally at UC was attended by only a handful of IC\nstudents. The basis of this rally was\na speech by a Labour Back-ben cher criticizing Crosland's policy. At the\nsame time and apparently without\nthe knowledge of IC Executive, a rally was held in Downing St. and\na petition delivered. Another lobby of\nParliament was held; no IC students\nwere present.\nChelsea meeting\nFinally at an IC supported rally\nat Chelsea two IC students were pre-sent, a speaker, who was Brendan\nParker, IC Honorary Secretary, and\na reporter. This poor attendance may\nhave been due to the fact that although IC Executive received notice of the rally six days before, news\nof it was only released on Tuesday\nto the Union. There were three\nspeeches, to an and ien ce of eighty;\nmost of the speeches being in favour\nof militancy over the problem and\nthe increase came under heavy fire as\na shortsighted piece of nationalism and 'a move to inequality'\nParker's speech was short and favoured consideration of the proposed\n'hardship fund' rather than attacking the main issue, the rise in fees.\nHe was against militancy and broadly speaking accepted the fees rise\nas an established fact. He added\nthat he did not represent the voice\nof IC Union.\nJ. Mullaly\nTizardians and\nthe Goldsmiths\nThe historic connections between\nCity and Guilds College and the\nWorshipful Company of Goldsmiths\nis being kept alive by the residents\nof Tizard Hall, who feel that their\nrelationship wi h the Goldsmiths is\nparticularly close since Sir Henry\nTizard, from whom the Hall takes\nits name, was at one time a Prime\nWarden of the Company.\nIn the past few years the mer fl rb ers of the Hall have been ths\nguests of the Company at receptions\nat Goldsmith's Hall where they have\nhad the opportunity of finding out\nmore about the work of the\nGoldsmiths and meeting some of\nthe members of the Company. The\nresidents of the Hall have reciprocated this generosity in their modest\nway by entertaining some of the\nmembers of the Livery at their an*\nnu al Mulled Wine Party held on\nSt. Nicholas's Day.\nThis relationship was strengthened recently when two members of\nthe Hall, A. J. Smith and D.C. Howell ,were invited to the Livery\nDinner at Goldsmith's Hall on\nFebruary 1st. The residents of\nTizard Hall felt themselves to have\nbeen honoured by this gesture, and\nthe two guests were greatly impressed by the lavishness of the\nhospitality accorded them.\nA. J. Smith\nA team of four couples from\nImperial College Dancing Club\ngained third place in the London\nInter-collegiate Ballroom Dancing\ncompetition held at Q.E. C. last\nweek.\nThis is a notable achievement\nsince this is the first time the club\nhas taken part in a competitive\nevent for many years.\nThe final positions of the teams\nwere as follows ;\nU.C.32 points 1st Q.M. C.12 points 3r dI.C.12 points 3rd Q.E. C.11 points 5th Kings 15 points 2nd Our best achievement was in the\nWaltz where our two couples were\nplaced 2nd and 3rd. As the results\nshow, the competition was closely\nfought apart from the convincing\nvictory by U.C. They, however,\nhave had considerable competition\nexperience.\nThe improvement in the I.C. team\nsince it was first conceived a few\nmonths ago has been remarkable\nand with this encouraging result\nthere are excellent prospects for the\nfuture. In particular this competition provided good experience for\nthe Intervarsity competition at\nLiverpool this week, in which the\nsame team will be competing.\nThe club congratulates the team\non their success and hopes that in\nthe future I.C. Dancing Club will\nbe able to play a greater part in\ninter-collegiate competitions, at ths\nsame time continuing to cater foi\neveryone interested in ballroom\ndancing, from the beginner upwards.\nLate News : IC were placed 8th out\nof the 15 universities competing at\nLiverpool.\nR EG.

''But the danger of\nchanging permanently the biological equilibrium in the kingdom of\nmicrobes is less acute : on a world\nscale you cannot affect microbes as\nyou can rabbits or flies because of\nthe rapidity with which microbes\nmultiply.\"\nYou mentioned in your inaugural address that a lack of collaboration between biologists and\nchemists has delayed important\nprogress. Has this situation im-proved? What do you think\nwould be the most effective way\nof overcoming this problem?\n\"You have to make people aware\nof the existence of other disciplines.\nOne should be able to snot problems outside one's own field and\nbe able to take them to someone\nwho can solve them. In biochemistry,\nwe have an interdisciplinary ap-p roach, and trying to integrate the\nsystem is a very important task. For\nexample, if a microbiologist finds an\ninteresting system, a chemist isolates it, an engineer produces it in\nlarge quantities and biochemists and\nbiophysicists then study its structure\nand function. Integration is the key\nword for success.\" But here again\nwe came up against the communication problem, and I asked about\njargon in technical literature. Professor Chain hold strong views on\nthis point. Some of these jargon s have become very irritating. People\ntalk of \"melting\" of nucleic acids,\nbut nucleic acids do not melt...\n'melting' is a well defined transition.\nWhat they call 'melting' is the dissociation of the two strands composing the nucleic acids.\" Another example : \"We use computers quite a lot and run up against the electronics\njargon... they talk of 'software' and\n'hardware' He made a gesture of\ndismay. \"International Commissions\nare set up to establish conventions\nfor notations. Mind you, von have to\nbe a specialist to understand chemical nomenclature!\"\nAs to overcoming the problem of\ncommunication : \"You must meet\nand talk to people. This is in man v ways more important than reading\nthe literature.\"\nDo you think that there exists\na serious gap between sociological and technological develop-ment?\n\"I don't know whether this gap\nis bigger now than it was in the\npast. Ever since the introduction of\nmachines there has been a gap of\nthis kind, and there must always be\none\". He suggested that restrictive\npractices were one result of this gap.\n\"We have to convince people that\nimproved technology gives more\njobs, not fewer. But this is not a new problem.\nProfessor Salam was upset that\npeople in positions of power in\nthe Western countries did not\nmake effective use of the technological means at their disposal\nto attack world problems. He\nsuggested that scientists should\ntry to do this. How do you feel\nabout this problem?\n\"Scientists are in no way better\nqualified to direct human affairs\nthan anyone else. In fact, many are\nmore prejudiced and more emotional\nthen their non-scientific colleagues.\nScientific thought does ot make one\nmore logical in matters outside\none's scientific subject, more balanced or a better human being. On the\nwhole, a scientist is often worse off\nthan a non-scientist since he does\nnot have to deal directly with\npeople. It is important, however,\nthat politicians should have scientific knowledge, just as it is important\nthat scientists should have non-scientific knowledge. But I don't be-li eve, for instance, that scientists\nalone arc in a position to relieve\nworld suffering. For example, starvation : this is not a scientific or\ntechnological problem. \"Professor\nChain does not believe in the special\nagencies of the United Nations...\n\"since they make people believe\nthat you can do things you can't. What is the use of international\norganisations if their proposals are\nrejected by the governments they are\ndesigned to help on social or\nreligious grounds ?\" He cited as an\nexample the refusal to use cow dung\nas fertilizer in India. \"This means\",\nhe said, \"that nitrogen from the\nsoil is not replaced. It is simply\nburnt.\" The problem of starvation\n\"is not a technological problem, it is\na political and religious one.\nPeople must realise this. Monkeys\nand cows in India consume vast\nquantities of food\". On the 'pop ul at ion explosion' \"Effective methods of\nbirth control wouldn't be used in\nmany countries...\" again on religious\nor social, not scientific grounds.\nDisease? \"There is no scientific\nreason for tuberculosis to exist. All\nyou need do to get rid of it is to\nabolish overcrowding and under-nourishment. But it is not up to the\nscientist to solve these problems.\n\"As for improving sanitation, this is\nuseless unless you also feed people.\nThe tact is tli at unless you teed\npeople as well, you merely disturb\na biological equilibrium... something\nyou must pay for later. To fight\npoverty, disease and starvation effectively you must attack simultaneously from all angles. We in the West\nare blamed, but we can't solve\npeople's problems for them. All our\nsuggestions are futile if religious or\nsocial taboos forbid their implement-ation. Moreover, one cannot a boli such taboos by decree... witness the\ncaste system in India.\"\nProfessor Chain was particularly\nconcerned with the myth of the omnipotence of science. \"Worship of\nscience as a pana cae a for all evils is\ngrossly exaggerated.\"\nIn your inaugural address, you\nmentioned that \"Imperial College would develop into the\nmost broadly conceived technological university in Europe.\"\nWould you expand on 'broadly\nconceived'?\n\"The College has suffered a terrific loss through the death of our\nformer Rector, Sir Patrick Linstead,\nand for me, this has been a severe\nand personal loss as well.\" Sir\nPatrick Linstead was strongly opposed to the 'two cultures' idea, and\nwanted to make Imperial College\ninto a broad College, in which the\nhumanities had its proper place.\"\nThis College has a marvellous\ngalaxy of sci eni sts, but we must\nsr eng then the humanistic approach...\nas has been done at MIT in Amciica. We must not allow ourselves\nto become mere technicians. Sir\nPatrick Linstead conceived that the\nexpansion programme of the College\nshould include the incorporation of\nthe Architectural Association; this\nwould lead through architecture to\nthe arts\u2014painting, sculpture and\nthe history of art. We already have\na department of management problems which provides contact with\npsychology and the study of hunan\nrelations.\" Professor Chain regarded\nthe introduction of some measure of\nhumanities into Imperial College as\nof great importance. \"We hope\nthat our next Rector will follow the\npath towards broader education,\ninitiated by the late Rector\" he con-clude d. encyclopaedic Marconi\nElectronic and mechanical engineers,\ndesigners, system planners and\nmanufacturers of telecommunications,\nbroadcasting, maritime and aviation\nradio equipment; radar, television,\nspecialized components, microelectronics,\ndata processing equipment and navigational\naids on land, at sea and in the air\nThe Marconi Company Limited\nMARCONI HOUSE, CHELMSFORD.
