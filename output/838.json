    "content": "Clubs\nATHLETICS\nUL Championships\nroundup The University of London Athletics\nChampionships were held at\nTooting Bee track on March 8 and\n11. This was earlier than usual, to\nease the selection of the UL BUSF\nteam. Our traditional venue,\nMotspur Park, would have been\nunsuitable for athletics in very wet\nconditions, so in the light of the\nunpredictable March weather, the\nsynthetic track at Tooting was\nchosen.\nImperial College has recently\ndone very well in these\nchampionships, winning in1986( Men and Combined) and 1987\n(Men), except for last year which:\nwas a bit of a write-off. However,\nundeterred by last year's debacle we\ndecided to try to recapture the title.\nDue to some unfortunate and persistent injuries, our middle\ndistance squad was weaker than\nnormal. The turn out overall was\nnot very good, especially as far as\nthe ladies were concerned, but those\nwho turned out really gave their\nbest.\nFish, our star high jumper, also\nproved to be an able 110m hurdler\n(6th), discus thrower (4th), shot\nputter (3rd) and hammer thrower\n(3rd) as well as comfortably winning\nthe high jump with a jump of 1.85m and with three very good tries on\n1.90m. Do we have a budding\ndecathlete here?\nAn athlete who has already\ndabbled with the decathlon is Andy Rogers, our team organiser. He proved to be an invaluable point\nscorer yet again. He came 4th in the\n100m,2 nd in the 200m,3r d in the\nPole Vault, 4th in the High Jump,\n4th in the Triple Jump, 1st in the\nHammer and 2nd in the Shot Put.\nHe also anchored both the 4x100m and the 4x400m relay teams.\nDan McQueen and John Rowland\nmade it to the finals of the 400m and\n800m respectively. Peter Smith tried\nan alternative to hurdling when he\ndecided to go under rather than\nover the last hurdle, however the\nofficials were not impressed and\nsubsequently disqualified him. Dave\nKnight (400m Hurdles) and Dil(l)(3000m) ran well, but the opposition\nwas to strong on the day. Stuart\nCameron gave his all in the 2000m walk, only to just miss out on the\npoints.\nJohn Rowland, who had run the\n800m heat in his trainers, was\nconsiderably more serious for the\nfinal as he had acquired a brand new\npair of spikes, and it really paid off.\nThe pace was fast, Justin Chaston of\nGoldsmiths' showing his class, but\nJohn gritted his teeth and hung on.\nThe 1500m final, a few hours later,\ngave Chaton his fourth gold medal,\nhaving also won the 3000m, as he\nromped home unchallenged. Alex\nGaskell made a break for the silver\nwith a lap to go, was unfortunately\ncaught but still finished a creditable\nfourth and Stefan Ledin captured\none point for his sixth place. The\nfight for team honours was still\nASIANSOC\nCulture\nWell, it's here at last! And, for those\nwho haven't heard about it yet, it's called Asian Soc\u2014a fresh Society\nwith fresh aspirations. Its aim, quite\nsimply, are to promote and encourage the culture of Asia and its\ninhabitants among an increasing\nmulti-cultural crowd of students at\nImperial.\nIt's a Society for everyone! For\nAsians \u2014 by endeavour ing to\nincrease the integration of all their\ndifferent cultures and faiths and\nattracting members from a diverse\nrange of backgrounds and communities. But also, for non Asians \u2014by providing them a new\nand exciting opportunity to learn\nand appreciate various aspects of\nthe Asian culture.\nIt aims to be different and to bring\nto you only events which have extra\nstyle and class! With sparkling\nideas, demanding challenges an a assurance of the 'top activities in town', it intends to positively\nchange the face of the College in a way never conceived or attempted\nbefore.\nSo, how can you get involved?\nBegin by getting your friends\ninterested\u2014tell them the wonderful\nnews. The Society is offering\nmembership at a mere fee of \u00a31.50,\ncovering not only this term but the\nrest of the next academic year. This\nguarantees no disappointments and\nentitles you to super deductions at\nall of the Society's events. What\nmore could you ask for?\nFor anyone out there with plenty\nof bright ideas and suggestions for\nforthcoming events\u2014why not come\nforward? If you have anything\nyou'd like to propose or wish to\nmake further enquiries about\nmembership, then contact the\nFounding President, Bhartendu\nVyas (Computing 1) as soon as\npossible and keep a close eye on the\nAsian Soc noticeboard along the\nwalkway near the bookshop.\nbetween UCL,a rapidly emerging\nteam, and your heroes, IC. It came\ndown to the final relays, the 4x100m and 4x400m. The 4x400m squad (P Smith, D McQueen, J Rowland, A Rogers) ran\na very de tre mined race and annihilated the other teams to win in an excellent time of 47.0s. IC was\nthen up against a formidable UCL team in the 4x400m relay but we\nonly needed to finish f out h or\nhigher to win the title. Again a very\ngutsy performance by our boys (D McQueen, J Rowland, A Gaskell, A Rogers) brought us home in third\nplace to clinch the title \u2014 UL Champions (Men) 1989\u2014by four\npoints. The will to win was nicely\ndisplayed by the fact that we were\nonly three points ahead on the first\nday but then managed not only to\nhold the distance but also extend\nour lead.\nWhat about the ladies then? There\nwere only two women from IC\ncompeting this year. Alison Turner\nput in some solid performances in\ncoming 4th in the 100m,5 th in the\n200m and 2nd in the 400m. Helen\nMacintosh, just back to running\nafter an ankle injury, fought well in\nthe 1500m and 3000m finals, but just\nmissed out on the points. The turn\nout from IC was hot very good but\nall athletes competing did well and\nfought hard. The team spirit was\nsomething else, people were\ncheered on by their team mates and\nsome good-natured piss-taking of\npoor Stuart, our hip-wriggling\nwalker, took place. I would like to\nexpress my gratitude to Andy for\ntaking the time to put the team\ntogether and also thank the athletes\nfor turning up.\nA few of the IC athletes were\nselected to represent London University at BUSF in Derby, on April 30 and May 1. Fish was sleeted\nfor the High Jump where he did\nreally well, finishing 5th, with a quantum leap of 1.95m. Fish also\ntried his luck with the shot but\nfound his fellow competitors too\nstrong. Alison Turner ran in the\n400m, where she was eliminated in\none of the high standard heats. She\nalso ran in the 4x100m team which\nfinished 5th. Alex Gaskell and\nStefan Ledin went to Derby as\nreserves, and both got to run. Alex\nran in a very hot 5000m heat and\nfought courageously. IC Captain\nStefan was left floundering in the\nwater jumpin the 3000m steeplechase. There must have been\nsomething wrong in the seeding\nprocedure, as the idea is to make\nsure that the strongest runners do\nnot burst themselves to get to the\nfinal. Why Stefan was drawn to run\nint he fastest heat is beyond\ncomprehension. Admittedly, however, the only way he could\nhave made the final this year was if\nthere had been only one runner in\nthe heat.\nIf there are any budding athletes\nout there, do not hesitate to join in\nthe fun. We are training down at\nBattersea Park on Wednesday (at\n14.00) and Sundays (at 11.00). You can also reach us through the\nAthletic Club pigeonholes. Training\nin Hyde Park takes place just about\nevery day at about 12.30, meet in the\nUnion gym or by the noticeboard\nnext to the main staircase in the\nSCAB Social Colours\nEXEC Mark Barnard\nHelen Roberts \u2022 Kim Green\nRoy Harrison\nFILMSOC Jon Wood\nMartin Gans\nEmma Lutman CHAMBER MUSIC\nRabindra Roy Robert Manasse\nDavid Semeira Penny Ouvry\nJon Wood\nJAZZ & ROCK\nJames Stewart CHOIR\nBarry Cott\nOPSOC Pam Ganju\nSue Foister\nSean Doran DRAM SOC John Franks Adrian Hicks\nMark Lucking Joseph Andrews\nTom Monk David Colling\nMatthew Soane Peter Fordham\nCatherina von Guilleaume Zoe Hellinger\nStephanie Kivi\nORCHESTRA Mylan Lester\nJames Howard Adrian Pagan\nLesley Batty Vijay Thakur\nPage 10 FELIX June 2 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Letters\nDisillusioned\nDear Editor,\n- After reading Dominic Strowbridge's article in\nEELEX (issue 836), I found that I absolutely agree\nwith him in the sense that the other side of the .\ncoin has to be shown. However, does his opinion ,\n'typify those of the majority in IC? How many.\nstudents can cope with the heavy workload.\ntogether with a vast number of activities, like Mr.\nStrowbridge? Well, these remain to be open\nquestions, but I can say that I am not one of those.\nI used to be incredibly enthusiastic and entirely\nabsorbed in studying and playing various sport-games; I attained four A's and a merit in ' A' levels and was in teams of various sports and a debating society. With lots of hopes and\nenthusiasm I came to Imperial. It didn't take me\nlong to realise that the tremendous workload and\nthe lecturing pace had to approach the speed of\nlight to cover the massive syllabus. Then I started\nlosing interest in the subject I am reading; this\nresulted in lacking reading and hence not\nknowing the subject, which in turn made me hate\nit more and more. This vicious cycle went on and\non and has not ceased yet. Now the examination\nis approaching and I just have no motivation to\neven read through my notes for the very first,\ntime. In fact, I feel totally indifferent towards the\nexamination and don't care if I fail them all.\nSo, is it that bad in IC? Well I don't know, for\na coin has both head and tails and time will tell\neverything.\nName withheld by request.\nA bins life\nDear Bill,\nFor some years I have provided Imperial\nCollege with an invaluable service, as a receptacle\nfor rubbish. And yet, what thanks do I get for\nmy hard work? Every Saturday night for the past\ntwenty years IC students have vomited on me,\nand even worse pissed on me.\nNeedlessfosay I am handing in my resignation\ntoday and reporting my mistreatment to the\nNational Union of Rubbish Receptacles and Bins.\nYowrs sincerely, j The Bin by Beit Quad.\nWobbly bits\nDear Bill,\nI am writing to complain in the strongest\npossible terms about the lack of wobbly bits in\nFELIX. It seems to me that FELIX is still living\nin the 15th century when it comes to wobbly\nthings but let's face it, the student readership,\nwhen it comes to the crunch, is interested in little\nelse. You need look no further than the circulation\nfigures of the Sun and Sunday Sport for proof.\nHave you forgotten that we are living in a College;\nthat has six times as many blok es as women?\nThere is an obvious demand.\nWobbly bits are the in thing. Stuff the letters\npage\u2014let's have a full page of bouncing thing ies,^ and let's not make it sexist\u2014dan gly bits.\nSurely we should not be ashamed of our\nd anglers and wobble rs in this enlightened day\nand age? I know that many of the people in\nSherfield have wobbly dan gly bits, but they waste\nthem by sitting on them all day. They would be\nmuch better off displaying their bits on the pages\nof FELIX\nYours,\nMary Whitehouse.\nLawnmower\nconspiracy\nDear Bill,\nI was absolutely astounded to find that the\nex i nations were canceled last week, and I am very\nsuspicious that the printing mistake was a small\npart of a larger conspiracy.\nI must ask why a Japanese lawn mower appeared in the examination paper, and whether\nthis could be linked to the Japanese lawn mower awareness program. This may explain, I think,\nthe number of Japanese students at Imperial, and\nmaybe their high marks.\nI must also point out that this is probably not\nthe first year such a mistake has happened but\nit has been occur ing over a period of several\nyears, undiscovered by most of the students, who\ndon't know anything about their exams anyway.\nI think the setting of such papers may have large\nlinks with student de motivation, and may affect\nin a great way the mentality of the students.\nSo as not to end on a pessimistic note, there\nis some good news. The present shortfall in\nstudent sponsorship could soon be met by a large\ninput of money from Japanese lawn mower companies, wanting specialist assembly staff.\nThis could at least solve the financial problems\nof some students.\nYours sincerely\nSydney Harbour-Bridge\nName printed extra large by re guest. Unjustified &\ninsulting\nDear Bill, or Nigel, or whoever runs FELIX this week,\nI wish to protest about Rupert Seldon's letter\nof last week; it contained no arguments against\nmy article, and was just a series of personal\ninsults. How can he tell me I need to learn about\nother people's feelings?\nIn reference to Martin Crater's letter of May 26,\nI would say I didn't start the mixing of religion\nand politics in College. My article is a reaction\nto the left wing bias of the Chaplaincy. The\nChaplaincy handed out anti-Tory literature at\nFreshers' Fair, and in its weekly magazine. There\nis even a 'Vote Green' poster on their\nnoticeboard.-It is both unjustified and insulting for Martin\n'to question the validity' of my faith.\nYours,\nDylan James, Maths 1. x Goldfish\nDear Sir,\nHaving read your last issue of FELIX, I feel that\nI have to complain about the amount of totally\nfabricated material which you choose to put in,\nit. I realise that you had a limited, if not zero,\namount of input from students not connected\nwith FELIX, but did you have to go out of your\nway to invent characters to fill your letters page\nand artificial small ads which have been\ndeliberately misleading. One unfortunate\nstudent, having read the small ad concerning hot\nbikes going cheap, rushed off to Mend-a Bike to\npurchase one, only to find that he had been\ndeliberately misled by the only publication which\na student should be able to believe. So, no more\nfabrication please!\nEric Rash.\nRemarkable\nDear Bill,\nI wonder if your readers have noticed the\nremarkable similarity between the lead story in\nlast week's FIDO 'Physics Finalists Bombout' and\nthat of FELIX issue 660 in 1983 entitled 'Bomb\nScare! Reeves Saves the Day'.\nDo you think they are related?\nYours sincerely,\nPallab Ghosh.\nDangerous\nDear Bill\nIt seemed appropriate to write in and warn\nyour readers of the dangers of playing with\nmatches. Although most students are well aware\nof the risks involved it is still perturbing to note\nthat many students regular y use matches to light\ncigarettes and gas cookers. This is a dangerous\npractice and one that must be stamped out before\nthere is a serious incident. Is'nt it about time\nlegislation was passed to make the striking of\nmatches illegal? I will be patrol ing Southside\npersonally during the next few days with a fire\nextinguisher to put out any lighted matches I find.\nAny students caught with matches will be\nimmediately expelled and have their degree\nwithheld.\nYours\nIan Gillet\nNo small ads!\nDear Bill,\nHow nice it is that FELIX is safe in your\ncompetent hands again.\nNigel's FELIX last week was a disgrace. There\nwas no Small Ads section, not surprising when\nyou consider the whole issue was only four\npages!\nThank God you're back!\nYours,\nDylan fame s, Maths 1.\nMay cow dung fall unto Nigel from now until\nthe end of time. Amen.\nPage 2 FELIX June 2 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Bohemia\nGuide to Bohemia\nNorth of Paddington, South of the\n\u2022wastes of Kilburn lies a magic land.\nWide tree lined avenues of 1930's mansion flats abound. Stretching\nfrom the opulence of St. John's Wood, across the waters and cafes\nof Little Venice, up to the fading\ngrandeur of Maida Vale, the area\nreeks of decadent wealth. This is\nLondon's Bohemia.\nThe place to begin the mystic\njourney is Maida Vale Underground\n(Bakerloo line). Note the in imi cable'30 sarchi tech ture a hint of things\nto come. Turning left down Randolph Avenue until we reach a large green roundabout. Opposite is\nthe Warrington Hotel (Free House)\n- our first stop.\nThe Warrington is a Grade 2 listed\nbuilding, a temple to Art Deco. The\nfresco above the lounge bar is an\nexample of the worst taste our\nancestors have ever created.\nCrowded at weekends, the pub\ntends to be lively most nights. An excellent pint of Fuller's ESB can be\nobtained, also served are Pride,\nAbbot, Brakspears Best and Ruddles\nCounty.\nWe continue South down Randolph Avenue, reaching Clifton\nRoad. Here we turn left and about\n100 yards on the right is the Robert\nBrowning (Samuel Smith's). Also\nlisted, this simple pub has\nfascinating stained glass in the main\nbar. Also worth a visit is the quiet\nQuiz\nBohemianism\nAre you a bohemian? Just answer\nthe questions in our simple quiz to\nfind out.\n1. If someone mentioned that they\nwere an existentialist would you\na) tell them it would get better soon\nb) ask them if this made eating in\nrestaurants difficult\nc) offer them your signed copy of\n'Huis Clos'?\n2. Is your preferred musical listening\na) Napalm Death\nb) Hungarian Folk Music\nc) The Earle Page Quartet?\n3. When eating out, would you go to\nra) Macdonald'sb) The Soho Brasserie\nc) The Jazz Cafe, Newington Green?\nlounge upstairs. The Museum of Ale\nis highly recommended. Tuesday is\nquiz night with a barrel of beer for\nthe winning team.\nWe turn right out of the Robert\nBrowning, continue to the end of\nthe road, then turn right into Maida\nVale. After 100 yards we turn left\ninto Aberdeen Place. Up the bank\nand on the left is Crocker's( Free\nHouse).\nCrocker's was built by aMr. Crocker who, anticipating the new\nLondon terminus of the Great\nWestern Railway, designed and\nbuilt a grandiose pub/music hall for\ntravellers; expecting a great profit.\nSadly, the GWR went to\nPaddington and 'Crocker's Folly'\nwas left stranded. Since then St.\nJohn's Wood has grown around the\nVictorian relic and the pub is fairly\nbusy.\nIt is a listed building and the\nceilings are astounding. The room \u2022\nto the left of the entrance is a working theatre with a free 'music\nhall' ca beret on Wednesday nights.\nBeers are an odd mix of small\nnorthern breweries and there is\nusually something worth sampling.\nWalking back to Maida Vale and\nstraight across we pass south of the\ncanal along Maida Avenue then\npass round the south of the Little\nVenice basin to the Bridge House on\nDelamere Terrace (Charringtons).\n4. For an evening out, would you\nwear\na) Your leather jacket with the\ntastefully tipp exe d artwork you did\nyourself\nb) The little number you bankrupted\nyourself for from that divine\nboutique down the King's Road\nc) Black with a hat?\n|5. What are your political views?\nia) British National Party\nb) Green\nc) Don't know, but willing to discuss\nit until three in the morning.\n6. What are your religious\nconvictions?\na) Hendrix is God b)C of E, but only if it's a nice\nchurch\nc) None (I'm an existentialist).\n7. What charities would you support?\na) Alcoholics Anonymous\nb) The Donkey Sanctuary\nc) Save the Rose Theatre\n8. What is your idea of a good\nevening's entertainment?\na) Headbanging at the Marquee\nb) Seeing Pinter at the National\nThis pub houses the Canal Cafe\nTheatre with fringe shows most\nnights and from Thursdays to\nSundays at 10pm 'Newsrevue' - a satirical revue show on current\naffairs. A pleasant pint of\nCharrinton's IPA goes down well.\nTo finish we stagger round the\nnorth of Little Venice, passing\nWarwick Avenue underground and\nto the right of a church (with a long\nthin spire). A little way up Castellain\nRoad on the right is the Prince\nAlfred (Free House). The bar is split\ninto several booths of two or three\nc) Drinking wine on a friend's houseboat in Little Venice.\n9. Is your general appearance\na) Scruffy, with a beer belly\nb) Carelessly chic\nc)I'm not sure, it's so long since I looked in a mirror\n10. What is your favourite drink\na) Tennants lager\nb) Pimms and lemonade\nc) Red wine.\n11. Where would you prefer to live?\na) Middlesborough\nb) Chelsea\nc) Maida Vale\n12. What would you read on the\nTube?\na) Kerrang, Viz or The Sunday Sport\nb) Marxism Today, Spare Rib or The\nSatanic Verses\nc) The back of the Tube ticket.\n13. What would you do if you won the pools?\na)Go to the bar\nb) Buy a house in Chelsea Harbour\nc) Discover the claim form three\nyears later under a pile of dirty\nwashing.\ntables by gothic-styled Victorian\nwooden panels. To pass from one\nbooth to another (or to the loos) the\nsimplest route tende s to involve\nleaving the pup, although it is\npossible to crouch through minute\ndoorways along the har. The\nbuilding is, of course, listed and\nserves a good range of real ales\nincluding Marsdon's Pedigree and\n, ' Old Hooky'.1 Those in the know can then crawl\nto my flat. Otherwise, Warwick\nAvenue underground should be\nclose enough.\n14. What is your greatest ambition?\na) To bite the head off a live bat\nb) To go to Kathmandu\nIc) to publish a slim volume of poetry\nland die at 25 of tuberculosis.\nIf you scored\nmostly a's: Oh dear. You really\nhaven't got a clue, have you? Try\nand read a book which has words\nof more than one syllable (some of\nthem even have some quite exciting\nrude bits). There is more to life than\ndrinking lager, for example try\ndrinking wine. Both of these may\nimprove your chances with the\nopposite sex.\nmostly b's: Frankly, darling, I don't think you've got what it takes. You take yourself too seriously. Other\npeople are there to be ignored not\nimpressed. Remember, it doesn't matter what other people think\nabout you, but what you think\nabout them which is important,\nmostly c's: Where have you been all\nmy life? More importantly, why on\nearth are you at IC? You are either\na true Bohemian or else you\n! cheated. Come to the FELIX Office\nwith your completed questionnaire\nand we'll run away to Bohemia\ntogether.\nJune 2 1989 FELIX Page 9\n\n"

Humour may be the cornerstone of\ncivilisation, it is certainly a great\ncharacteristic of the British people.\nMaleable enough to serve the cause\nof the bigot as well as that of the\nsaint, it finds its most noble\nexpression in the defiant resilience\nof human values in the face of a sober evil. Historically it fulfils this\npotential in the Blitz spirit of second\nworld war London, and in theatrical\nexpression it informs this revival of\na little known Noel Coward play\nwhich first opened in 1947.\nThe atmosphere that Coward\nfound in Paris at the end of the war,\nwhilst playing cabarets to the\ntroops, was a mixture of the shame\nof the defeated and the bitterness\nagainst the more ig no mio us. collaborators. This fuelled his\nspeculation as to the fate of the\nBritish spirit had the battle of Britain\nbeen lost, Operation Sealion\n(Hitler's invasion plan) succeeded\nand this country been annexed as\nthe emerald in the crown of the\nthousand year Reich.\nThe retrospective prognosis was\nof course good, and in order to\nprove it Coward assembled a cast of\ncharacters from cockneys to the\nupper crust to play out the drama\nof this daydream in the setting of a Knightsbridge pub.\nSuspending all thought of\nstereotypes as we enter the near\nThe Drowned\nand the\nSaved\nby Primo Levi\nThe S. S. concentration camp guards\nboasted that the enormity of their\ncrime would never be appreciated\nwhatever the outcome of the war.\nThey thought that they could\ndestroy the physical evidence and\nthat any survivors 'would not be\nbelieved'. The Nazis were wrong.\nOur problem has not been one of\ncredulity\u2014the appalling condition of\nthe survivors and the piles of\nunburied corpses speak for\nthemselves\u2014but of understanding\nthe nature of those who committed\nthe crimes. This book, just\npublished in paperback, is Levi's attempt to examine this problem,\nwhich he acknowledges can only be\npartially successful.\nPrimo Levi was an Italian Jew, a chemist by profession, without\nreligious beliefs, who was\ntransported to Auschwitz in 1944.\nHe escaped death in the gas\nchambers and on an almost equally\nfatal forced march to Germany by a series of almost impossible chances.\nHaving recounted the facts of his\nexperiences elsewhere, and after\nforty years of reflection, Levi at last\n.felt able to offer an analysis of what\nhe and many millions of others\nunderwent. With his intelligence\nand powers of observation,\nsharpened by his scientific training,\nremaining with him even in\nAuschwitz, Levi describes the\ndisintegration as human beings of\nthe guards, through their self-deception, and the stripping of the\nJews themselves down to a common\nhumanity.\nIt is part of Levi's purpose to\napportion blame, and although,\nunlike the Christian Dostoyevsky,\nhe is aware that small act of\ngoodness cannot outweigh gross\nevils, he is concerned to do so with\nhumility and understanding.\nAll Primo Levi's work is valuable,\nbut this book, at a time when we\nface the stirring of threats from other\nmurderous orthodoxies is perhaps\nthe most valuable of all.\nBA Costello.\nfeudal it y of forties Britain we are\nintroduced to such staunch-hearted\ntypes as the landlord and his good\nlady wife serving to a sprinkling of\ngenuine gentility and several salt of\nthe earth flat caps. Mr and Mrs\nGrainger (James George and Anne\nCourtney) supplying a particularly\nbrilliant duo whose sense of comic\ntiming brings out perfectly the\nirrepressible humour that\ncounterpoints the more menacing\ntone of the second act. But in amongst them are two whom patriotic prejudice pick out as most\ndefinitely not upper-fl as s types; a resident German; and that most un-English of beasts the arrogant\nintellectual. The parts that these two\nwill play as Chamberlain's dream\nfades to a bloody nightmare is a speculation polite enough not to\novertax one's brain.\nAnd so with a typically twee little\nditty, from a chorus of four, entitled\n'Don't lets be beastly to the\nGermans' we lurch ironically on into\nthe rather more serious business of\ndefeat and occupation. At first, as\none would expect, this trifling blip\nin the status quo is subsumed in a dignified way with a slight change\nin drinking habits (Gordon's gin\nbeing swapped for a rather rough\nrum) and a quip at the ready to spar\nwith the humour less Huns.\nIt is not long though before the\nawestruck captors tire of such\ngames. The spell is broken and reality forces itself upon them with\nruthless insistence. As half hinted\nrumour emerges as fact, and Nazi war crimes are witnessed in a tortured human form, it is clear that\na stiff upper lip is no substitute for\naction and resistance against the evil\nregime.\nThe thirty strong cast of this play\nkeep up a formidable pace and a gripping tension throughout both\nacts and the stage is never still nor\nover cluttered. In fact it is only as\nthey gather for a final sentimental\nsong about certain southerly cliffs\nthat the full size of the company\nbecomes apparent.\nWith its unashamed patriotism\nand its unerring faith in the British\ncharacter this play faces accusations\nof smugness self-indulgence and\noversimplification. These accusations are true. But, given the\ncircumstances of the war the view\nthat some 'British' traits may tend\ntowards virtue are emotionally hard\nto resist. God forbid that\ncommonsense should be out doctrine but God forbid also that our\nmorals be based on anything other\nthan a sense of common humanity.\nPM McNeillis (MAC).\nContinues until 18th June.

    "content": "Alternative\nJesus votes Monster\nRaving Loony!\nIn his article (FELIX 833) Dylan\nJames asserted that God was a Tory.\nLet me say here that he is one\nhundred and one percent correct:\nGod is indeed a member of the\nConservative Party and is, in fact,\nspecial honorary undersecretary to\nthe treasurer of Imperial's own ConSoc. I know this because I, Phenominus D. Turkey, ConSoc\nHon-Und-Tres-Sec, am God. Now, obviously, many people will\nfind this hard to accept. They will\nrefuse to believe that 'Phenny', the\npopular and cheerful member of the\nLiniment Hall house committee is,\nin reality, the omnipotent being who\ncontrols all our destinies. I, myself,\npersonally initially and before I came to college did not know that\nI was a deity.\nMy suspicions were first aroused\nwhen I started to realise that I was\nalways, without exception, right.\nFor example, I get every question of\nevery problem sheet I do absolutely\ncorrect, even the ones the lecturers\nand the rest of the class all get\nwrong.\nBut it is not just in the questions\nof Life, the Universe and Everything\nthat I am unfailingly correct. I am\nalso unerring in my politics. Since\nI was old enough to wave a Union\nJack, I have been a supporter of the\nConservative cause and I agree\nwholeheartedly with every single\nthing Mrs. Thatcher says and does.\nMargaret, as everyone knows, has\nnever made a mistake in her life.\nTherefore I must also be infallible\nand I present this as conclusive\nproof of my perfection.\nAh ha! I hear you cry, this does\nnot prove that I am God. I could be\nthe second coming of Jesus Christ.\nTrue, but was not Jesus the son of\nGod and did he not hear his father's voice telling him what to do. I have\nnever heard the voice of God. I may,\noccasionally, have spoken with my\ninvisible friend Herbert, but even he\nseems to have gone away since I started my medication. So if God does not speak to me despite my\nobvious perfection, therefore I must,\nmyself, be God and Dylan, my prophet, must be Jesus Christ\nreincarnated.\nBut if I am God then who is the\ndevil. I have thought long and hard\nabout this. The devil is obviously a socialist: such people are the spawn\nof Satan and I read in the Sun that\nthe Diabolical One personally told\none of their reporters that he voted\nLabour in the last election. I, God, am a great personal fan of this fine\nChristian Paper and I advise, nay\nbeseech, you to believe everything\nit says and I, you must not forget,\nam always right.\nSo which of the socialist scum\nwho inhabit the Earth is the Devil.\nI tell you, he is an evil and cunning\nman, a man in high office, a man\nwho will not admit his true identity\nand will do everything in his power\nto stop me broadcasting my message to the world. The Devil is\nJason 'Scott' Donovan from Neighbours: a man from a socialist\ncountry, the devil's land of\nAustralia. It is a plot: soap operas\nare a curse, the people are all under\nits spell. They worship the devil\ninstead of worshiping me.\nAt 5.35 each day, even my loyal\nfollowers desert me for the dark\none. They all turn to the television\nand ignore their Lord. Some even\nblaspheme: only yesterday, I was\ntold to 'stop standing in front of the\ntelly'. My time is soon, God must\nsave his children from this curse. I am ready.\nSo, Sons and Daughters (and\nNeighbours), be at peace. God has\nspoken. Now, as the cock crows five\ntimes at midnight and large pink\nrabbits gambol in Hyde Park, I say\nit is safe to come out and worship\nme!

This garden was\none of the many exhibits on show.\nWelfare survey shock; IC is very boring\nThe results of the Union's welfare\nsurvey were made public this week,\nand provided some interesting\nreading, particularly in the area of\nalcoholic habits and attitudes to\nsexuality.\nDespite the myths surrounding\nalcohol consumption at Imperial,\n44% of all those replying to the\nsurvey claimed that they drank soft\ndrinks more regularly than alcohol,\nwith postgraduates and overseas\nstudents stretching this value to\nalmost 6 0 % . This left\nundergraduates the highest overall\nconsumers of alcohol.\nThe majority of students claim\nthey drink approximately 16 units\nper week, and of those that refrain\nfrom drinking, 32% gave health,\n22% religion, and 47% 'don't like'\nas their reason.\nThe results suggest that the\ncollege bars are less popular than\npubs; 49% of respondents drink in\ntheir local bars and 33% in other\npubs and wine bars compared with\n43% who use Southside and 31%\nthe union Bar as their local.\nThe Survey showed a high\ntolerance towards homosexuality.\nEighteen per cent of responses\nfound male homosexuality\nacceptable, 2 1 % found female\nhomosexuality acceptable, with only\n10% and 7% respectively feeling that\nsuch sexuality should be\ndiscriminated against. Ninetyfive\npercent of the replies were from\nheterosexuals of which 60% of the\nmales and 42% of females claimed\nto have had' no sex'. Of the\nremainder 74% of the females and\n67% of the males claimed the AIDS crisis has not affected their sexual\nbehaviour but when questioned\nabout their attitudes to AIDS sufferers, 18% felt it was 'their own fault' and a further 5 1 % felt\nsympathetic but unwilling to help.\nQuestions on contraception\nrevealed that 8% of couples don't use any, and of the remainder, 60%\nuse condoms and 50% rely on the\npill.\nFifty three percent of the males\nand 74% of the females who are\nsexually active have only one\nregular partner. Eleven percent of\nmales claimed to have regular one-night stands compared with less\nthan 4%of females.\nThere were a strange variety of\nresponses to the 'drugs' section of\nthe questionnaire. 50% of students\nsmoke tobacco and 12.5% cocaine\non at least 'a fair number of\noccasions', with up to 4 % taking\nother drugs including speed,\ncocaine and LSD on the same basis.\nIn contrast, 29% claimed that they\nwere unable to obtain tobacco on a regular basis.\nThe general feeling appears to be\nanti-drugs judging by the 59% of\nrespondents who feel that it is\nnecessary to clamp down on all\nforms of drug abuse.\nFinancial questions revealed that\n30% of Home Students and 16% of\nOverseas Students finance\nthemselves with loans compared\nwith 33% of Home Students.\nUndergraduates, on the whole, '\u2022\nspend less than postgraduates and\noversea's students, whose extra\nexpenditure is mainly ii h the area of\nfood and travel. This group,\nhowever, spend less on alcohol,\nalthough post-graduates admit to\nspending twice as much on cigarettes as either undergraduates\nor overseas students. There is little\ndifferentiation with respect to year\nor nationality in expenditure on accommodation, entertainment or\nclothing.\nForty two percent of students live\neither in college halls and houses,\nor head tenancies and59% of\nstudents pay between \u00a331 and \u00a350\nper week for their accommodation,\n17% between \u00a351 and \u00a380 and less\nthan 4% exceed this.\nThe vast majority of students live\nwithin a10 mile radius of college,\nless than 5% live between 11 and 20\nmiles away, and under 3 % live\nfurther out.\nThe final section of the questionnaire revealed that 65% of\nstudents come from a state\neducation, 3 3 % from private\nschools, and a surprising number of\n'don't knows'.\nIn response to the introduction of\nstudent loans, 16% claimed to be\nagainst them, 16% in favour and\n28% impartial.\nNigel Baker was pleased with the\nsuccess of the survey. He found the\nsexuality replies surprising, in that\nthey ' showed IC to be less\nhomophobic' then he had expected.\nISSUE 838 2 JUNE 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Felix\nEditorial\nMoon ies Members of the Moonies religious cult are currently visiting the halls of\nresidence in Imperial College. They have been distributing a leaflet which\nadvertises an 'international essay competition' and an international student\nconference. Please do not be taken in by this leaflet; it is little more than\na glamorous recruitment drive for new cult members and I advise everyone\nwho receives such a leaflet to throw it straight into the waste paper bin.\nThe Moonies regularly canvas Imperial College at this time of year posing\nunder the pseudonym of CARP (the Collegiate Association for the Research\nof Principles). Their recruitment campaign this year is a little more subtle\nthan their previous attempts, but students should bear in mind that the\norganisation does indulge in brain washing techniques (sleep and food\ndeprivation followed by intensive guilt inducing programmes) and that\nmembers of the cult are in every sense of the word exploited by the cult's leaders who live in comparative luxury.\nAnyone approached by members of the cult should bear in mind that\nthey operate on a principal which they refer to as 'divine deception.' This\nmeans that they feel morally justified in lying about their organisation so\nthat they can attract new members. These people are bad news and\nanyone discovering Moonies on College premises should contact the\nnearest security desk as soon as possible.\nBound editions\nAnyone requiring a leather bound edition of this year's FELIX should call\ninto the office and leave their name and a \u00a3 1 0 deposit.

The\ncost of a bound edition has yet to be negotiated but will probably be around\nthe \u00a3 3 0 mark.\nSubscriptions\nIf you are leaving College and still wish to receive copies of FELIX next\nyear you can do so for only \u00a3 1 0 , which covers the postage and packing\nfor a whole year's supply of FELIX.\nThe last issue\nIt is my sad duty to announce that the last issue of FELIX under my\neditorship will be published on 21 st June. There will a staff meeting today\nat 12.30 to discuss the contents of the final issue and everyone who has\nworked on FELIX this year should attend. Advanced warning is also given\nof a party & buffet on the same day for everyone who has contributed\nto this years FELIX.

All MSC chairmen and Union Office sabbaticals are\nrequired to submit their reports to FELIX before 5pm today.\nPorky Pies.\nNigel Baker has been 'economical with the truth' in a few of the comments\nhe made about his week spent editing FELIX.

    "content": "Bill & Nigel's Job Swap Report\nBILL\n1 started off mv week as Union\nI 'resident with the premise that I would pro bab lv not be able to\nachieve very much within the space\nof only a few days. The job is\nnebulous and less deadline\ndependent than FELIX and it really\ncomes down to the President to\ndecide how he or she is going to\nspend the day.\nThe ultimate frustration of being\nUnion President is that major\nchanges in the running of the Union\ndo take a long time; they have to go\nthrough the committee machina ry before they can be implemented. In\nmany ways, even a whole year is\nnot sufficient. This is in sharp\ncontrast to the job of FELIX Editor\nin which the end goal of each week\nis to produce 4000 copies of a publication.\nAlthough I started my week\nwithout really knowing what to\nexpect, 1 managed to settle into the\njob reasonably quickly. A lot of the\nPresident's time is taken up with\ncommittees. During my week, I experienced the Wardens' Sub Committee and the Students'\nWelfare Committee, both of which\nto dk up large portions of the day,\nbut they were nevertheless quite\nenlightening and certainly not as\ntedious as I had been led to believe.\n1 was quite pleasantly surprised to\ndiscover that 1 had met many of the\nCommittee members already whilst\npursuing news stories for FELIX.\nI was disappointed by the Students'\nWelfare Sbcimittee (d. n^m Re!\nshe\nnior\nmot.\ncharged extra for paying their h w fees in instalments. The rationale'\nwas that interest from hall fees was\nnot put back into the residence\naccount and so payment in instalments di jd not represent a financial u \u00bb s to the account.\nI iu'.v ever the Finance Officer argued\nwas put back into the\n.\n1 that a fee of \u00a33 per\n.11 not unreasonable for\nI illustration required.\n\u2022Stations the rest of\n\u2022file d.

The proposals deserve an article,\nof their own but suffice to Say that,\nin conjunction with the external\naffairs officer, 1 wrote to the DES\nhighlighting the dangers of the\nproposals and making alternative\nrecommendations. The letter is\navailable in the Union Office for\nanyone interested.\nOne of the greatest differences\nbetween FELIX and the Union office\nis the strong organisational backup\nof permanent staff which the Union\nOffice possesses. The permanent\nstaff are undoubtedly worth their\nweight in gold. Having a receptionist, for instance, means\nthat the President does not have to\ndeal with everyone who walks into\nthe office and having a permanent\nmember of staff to type letters saves\na good deal of time. In the same\n-way, the Union Manager, the\nJFinance Officer and the Welfare\n^Adviser are on hand to provide\ntv vi de ranging support,\nt* Overall, It hou roughly enjoyed\nI my week as Union President but in\nthe space of a week it was not\npossible to gain more than a flavour\nof the job and I'm sure Nigel will\nhave found the same with FELIX;\nperforming the job on a week to\nweek basis is a very different matter.\nNIGEL\nWhen I took over the Editor's role\nof FELIX for the week my main aim\nwas to get a reasonable newspaper\nout by a realistic hour on the\nThursday. In order to do this I saw\nmyself acting more in a managerial,\nthan editorial role. This meant\nensuring the efficient production as\nopposed to supervising and editing\nevery word written. Having spoken\nto a number of the FELIX staff it was\nclear that the rewriting of their\nstories and articles has been a constant bone of contention and so\nI felt that, with my own limited\nexperience, I had to avoid this at all\ncosts.\nThe content of my FELIX, or H DO as I chose to call it, also represented\nquite a shift from what Bill has been\nproducing this year and also from\nwhat many past FELIX Editors have\nproduced. By the time the\npermanent staff salaries, the cost of\nthe sabbatical editor and the\nrunning costs and budget of paper\nare added together it can be seen\nthat the production of FELIX, the\nNewspaper of Imperial College\nfoi>\nof information\nstudents, for k| of this Union it)\nis happening in tH\npromoting the ser\nthe Union. I'm sure\nmy FIDO achieve^\nto whether the s tul of the Union's total]\nit is up to them. Itj\nand I believer\ncontent of yr fur FE\ndecided upon.\nOn tire, technical side,\nthe ny* tW*' r1h helped^(ra it| l2l w beginning W last year was a definite\nadvantage. However, the majority\nof the production is only common\nsense, apart from the use of some\nof the specialist pieces of technical\nequipment. It was in the use of the\ntypesetter and process camera that\nI was at the mercy of whoever\nth l qui?\nthe\nopera!\nexpert]\nit w orl sheets if question I really re<3\nproducing I completed 1\ncolla tors close to ex i was done at iI should be\n-as. i Ear tyr. as,\nafternoon.\nThe second, often neglected, side\nof the job is the running of the Print\nUnit. This responsibility was really\ntaken away from me by virtue of\nthere being no external print jobs\n(except Bill's personal production)\nand the Litho being broken on the\nMonday. What non-FELIX printing\nthat was done was for the Clubs and\nUnion with equal emphasis on both.\nI must thank Bill for the work he\ndid ensuring my week in the Print\nUnit was as painful as possible.\nThank-you for giving the Printer\nTuesday off (this was the reason\nFIDO was only 16 pages and not\n24!). Thanks are definitely in order\nfor letting the A4 CP N paper run\nis essential for the\nf pictures and various\n\" A or k and so you can\nguess* exactly- what I thought of this\nlittle ( IH HR rom Bill's ordering.\nmistake that \\vat\nas in the news story\nmo'.

    "content": "Doctor\nFaustus\nThe Lost Theatre, 450 Fulham Road\nThe flickering candles suggest a church. The points of light pick out\neerie objects in the heavy darkness.\nFaustus, the faded scholar,\nlanguishes in his study\ncontemplating a wisdom more\npowerful than his learned readings\nhave yielded: The Art of Magic. This\nproduction's darkly menacing set\nseems an ideal place in which to\nconjure up the devil.\nAs with church attendances,\nthough, demand for the devil seems\nto be falling off. When I saw this\nshow the cast was more numerous\nthan the audience. Perhaps with\nsomething as familiar as Marlowe's classic people fear finding a virtual\nrecital of the piece at a fringe venue.\nHappily this production cannot be\ndescribed as such.\nStephen Lee's flamboyant Faustus\ninhabits the landscape of devils and\nspirits with conviction. He therefore\nmanages to dispel the seeming\nabsurdity of such a world and draws\nus into his spiral towards\ndamnation. The strength of his\nperformance holds the play together\nlike the hub of a wheel. Around that\nhub the rest of the cast sustain a dizzying whirl while Stephen\nRequera's solemn Mephistopholes\nhaunts the wings of the stage, like\nthe Grim Reaper in holy orders.\nWith a bravely low-key pe form ance he captures the watchman look,\noverseeing the inevitable fall of\nFaustus to death and damnation.\nThe two lead roles dovetail well and\nmake for a strong combination.\nThe frequent clowning scenes are\nthought to be later additions and not\nwritten by Marlowe himself.\nHowever they now form part of the\ncurrently accepted version.\nAt times these provide a little light\nrelief but at others are a definite\ndistraction. The company get*\nthrough most of the gags okay if\nwithout any great invention.\nWhat sense one can make of the\nreligious ideas that make this almost\na medieval mystery play is difficult\nto know. After all, Faustus' crimes\nconsist of having a craving to learn\na little cosmology, a keen interest in\nPope. Hardly matters for which, in\nany sense, one would expect to be\ndamned. But the appeal of this play\nlies chiefly in its striking imagery.\nThe Faustus myth has inspired\nmany for hundreds of years and will\ncontinue to do so as long as strong\nproductions such as this get\nsupport. I strongly recommend that\nyou see it this evening or tomorrow\nnight which is the end of its very\nshort one week run.\nMAC.\n(381 6151 for booking.)\nThe Man\nwith the\nFlower in his\nMouth\nCafe Theatre Club\nT am the son of Chaos', wrote Luigi\nPirandello, and besides the pun on\nthe isle of his birth, Kaos, it is easy\nto see why. His Six Characters in\nSearch of an Author is the arche typical play of what has been called 'meta\ntheatre' which openly proclaims\nitself as illusion with the aim of\nexposing the daily illusion that we\nrefer to as life. As Shakespeare had\nit 'AH the world's a stage', and if so\nthen what better place than a small\nroom above a pub for a man to meet\nyou and tell you something of his\nlife.\nSo it may happen that whilst\nwaiting one lunchtime in the Bear\nand Staff with your drink you may\nchoose to take the part of a stranger\nwaiting for a train and listen to the\nstory of 'The Man with the Flower\nin His Mouth', a short Pirandello\npiece. For less than half an hour you\nwill be waylay ed by a man with a cynical slant on life who berates an\nempty chair about the sad fiasco of\ntheir lives. The man had reason\nenough to be bitter it seemed but I didn't like the chap. I left hoping\nthat I'd be waylay eda little more\noften on the streets, in pubs or bars,\nbut next time by someone with a better tale to tell.\nMAC.\nPhone for details of lunchtime\nprogramme on 240 0794.\nThe Creative\nMonochrome\nImage\nDavid Chamberlain\nThis is an extremely useful and\nreadable book based on Chamberlain's own experiences as\na photographer. It certainly is not\naimed at snap shooters and as its\ntitle implies it is solely concerned\nwith black and white photography\nand creating 'images'. Anyone who\nhas seen Chamberlain's work will\nunderstand what is meant by image.\nThere are no landscapes or portraits\nhere.\nThe first half of the book concerns\ntechniques and considers such\nsubjects as composition and lighting. The majority of this section\nis given over to darkroom technique\ngiving ideas on film developer\ncombinations and printing.\nThe second half of the book is a folio of Chamberlain's own work.\nThe subjects contained here are as\ndiverse as the resulting images. The\ngreatest boon of this section is the\ncopious amount of information\nattached to each picture. This\nincludes comments from! Chamberlain on how he originally\nj envisaged the picture and how he\nachieved the result. The technical\ninformation includes camera and\nfilm used, lighting techniques, and\nprinting and finishing.\nThis book will be very useful to\nanyone who is intending to\nspecialise in black and white\nphotography and is prepared to\nspend many hours achieving the\nresult. I would not recommend it to\nanyone who is only casually\ninterested in photography or is not\nprepared to do their own darkroom\nwork.\nJune 2 1989 FELIX Page 7\n\n"
