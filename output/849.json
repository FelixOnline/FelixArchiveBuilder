    "content": "Top Doc\nstrikes back\nDear Editor,\nI have apologised for the 'cock-up in\ncommunications' headlined in FELIX on Friday\nOctober 27. Nonetheless, I do think your picture\ncaption suggesting that the Health Centre is a 'house\nof horror' was excessively harsh on us. We work\nextremely hard to provide a top rate service to all our\npatients and it would be nice to see FELIX writing\nabout the positive aspects of what we offer.\nMay I once again, through your columns invite any\nmember of College, patient or potential patient of the\nHealth Centre, to contact me directly with any\nproblems concerning the Health Centre. May I also\ninvite anybody interested to come to the next meeting\nof the Health Centre Patients' Group, which will be\non tuesday November 14 at 4.45pm at the Health\nCentre in the Group Room. If you have any worries,\nmoans, ideas or constructive suggestions do come\nalong and let us hear them.\nDr R Gillon, Director, College Health Service.\nBlame the\nthe other Applied Biologists and final year UG's for\nwhom the AUT action caused major difficulties.\nHowever, I do feel that any malice, resentment or\nbitterness should be directed at the\nlecturers/organisers involved in allowing this, not the\nindividual concerned. After all, if we had been offered\nthe same opportunity for placement, and the same\nopportunity to take our exams later (or when suitable),\nwould we have turned it down? I doubt it.\nSteph Parkin, Applied Biology 4.\nTurkish\ndelight?\nAUT\nDear Dave,\nAs one of the final year Applied Biologists referred\nto in the 'Personal' article, issue 848, I have a reply\nfor 'name withheld':\nI would be the first to agree that treatment of the\nindividual referred to in the said article was unfair to\nDear FELIX,\nMost of the students who visit the STA office in\nthe walkway must have noticed that STA advertises\nholidays in northern Cyprus. As most people know,\nnorthen Cyprus was invaded by the Turkish army in\n1974 and it is still illegally occupied. In this College\nthere are students whose relatives were killed, injured\nor missing, and many were forced to leave their home\nbecause of that, probably in the same place that now\nis advertised as a holiday resort.\nBesides, all the countries of the United Nations\n(except, of course, Turkey) have refused to recognise\nthe so-called 'state' of northern Cyprus.\nIt is our belief that such trips must not be organised\nor advertised at all. The 'Student Travel Agency', we\nthink, should be an agency for students and not a company that only seeks to make profit by any\nmeans, especially when this supports the violation of\nhuman rights. With this letter we want to express our\ndeepest regret for this attitude.\nYours sincerely,\nThe Committee of the Hellenic Society of IC.\nYou're\nwrong, Jack\nDear Dave,\nMichelle Codill's letter about loans and the Union's actions is typical of the 'I'm alright Jack' attitude that\nseems to be prevalent at the moment.\nOver the last few years we've seen health cuts,\nClause 28, benefit cuts, the poll tax and now student\nloans. But if you're with BUPA, straight, middle class,\na homeowner and about to walk into your job with\nPrice Waterhouse then why care.\nThe silent majority allow poverty, homelessness,\noppression, racism, homophobia and more to continue\nthrough their lack of action. Pastor Niemoeller, a victim of the Nazis, wrote this on the matter:-Firstly they came for the Jews\nand I did not speak out-because I was not a Jew.\nThen they came for the communists\nand I did not speak out-because I was not a communist.\nThen they came for the trade unionists\nand I did not speak out-because I was not a trade unionist.\nThen they came for me-and there was no one left\nto speak out for me.\nMaybe we should put up with it being harder for us\nto get jobs (after banning Price Waterhouse) and\nspeak out a bit more often. One day they might just\ncome for Michell and co.\nYours sincerely,\nAlistair Goodall, DoC III.\nULU TRAVEL\n\u2022 Low cost worldwide flights * Special fares for students\n* Expert advice for independent travellers\n\u2022 Tours, short breaks & ski holidays \u2022 Group bookings* Over 70 offices worldwide THE STUD tN J TRA From\nULU Travel\nSherfield Building\nImperial College \u2014 _ _ _ \u201e \u2122\nLondon SW7 3Z E3\n01-581 1022 Interconfinental\n01-581 8233 European\nA I!TV79525 ULU TRAVEL\nTHE BP GROUP\nThe following recruiting areas will be holding individual\npresentations during the Autumn Term:\nBP INFORMATION SYSTEMS Monday 13th November \u2014 5.30 p.m. Ante-Room \u2014 Sherfield Building\nOf interest to: \u2022 STUDENTS OF ALL DISCIPLINES BP CHEMICALS \u2014\nResearch and Development Monday 27th November \u2014 5.30 p.m. Ante-Room \u2014 Sherfield Building\nOf interest to: \u2022 CHEMISTS \u2022 MATERIALS SCIENTISTS \u2022 PHYSICISTS \u2022 CHEMICAL ENGINEERS BP ENGINEERING Tuesday 5th December \u2014 5.30 p.m. Ante-Room \u2014 Sherfield Building\nOf interest to: \u2022 ALL ENGINEERS Each presentation will be followed by a buffet and\ninformal discussion\nBP is an equal opportunity employer\n\n"

    "content": "THE\nDELATOR\nCOLUMN\nI have been asked to clarify a statement made in last\nweek's column regarding the department of Electrical\nEngineering. The decision taken by some lecturers to\nleave was based solely on their dissatisfaction with\nan academic appointment. It was not intended to infer\nthat the exodus of staff was due to poor lecturing.\nHammersmith &\nFulham:\nFraudulent?\nHammersmith and Fulham council were bailed out\nby the high court last week over some very dubious\nbusiness practices. The decision to invalidate deals\nmade by council leaders in the period 1987-89 has\nleft five major banks in deficit to the tune of \u00a3500m. The activities, known as 'interest-rate swaps', are\nhighly speculative. What the leaders of Hammersmith\nand Fulham council did amounts to nothing more than\nglorified gambling. The leaders of the council (of both\npolitical parties) were playing kismet with rate-payers'\nmoney.\nIt seems fraudulent to enter into a deal and later to\ntry and renege on it because it had started to make\na loss. The amount to be covered by the banks is\ndirectly the fault of the council leaders. Furthermore,\nthe Labour-controlled authority has admitted in the\nhigh court that it undertook illegal transactions.\nBearing this in mind, it seems farcical that council\nleaders have got off scott free. There should be some\nprovision in law to account for what is tantamount\nto defrauding the banks of such a large sum of money.\nMaybe any civil action taken will remedy this.\nRottweilers risk\nto children\nYet another incident with rottweilers hit the papers\nthis week. A four year old child was attacked by a pack of three and needed 21 stitches. The dogs have\nnot been destroyed due to a loophole in the law.\nThe clauses laid down in the new Dangerous Dogs\nAct (1989) require owners to be accountable for large\ndogs-such as rottweilers or alsatian s. Failure to\ncomply can result in the animal being put down. This\ndoes not apply to the incident in question, since it\noccured before the passing of the bill.\nThis new act has been welcomed, particularly in the\nwake of recent attacks. However, I feel it does not\ngo far enough.\nAll breeds of dog that are considered a possible\ndanger to life, such as the r ottweiler, should be made\nillegal to possess in the home. These genetic\nmutations belong in zoos or in the wild. The risk to\nhuman life, especially children, is far too great to allow\nthese animals to exist in an artificial habitat.\nSmall Ads ADVERTISE IN THE FELIX SMALL ADS SECTION\nFREE IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF IMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE UNION\nANNOUNCMENTS\n\u2022 Ladies Only-Wednesday 15th November sees\nthe start of a ladies only Water Polo session to be\nheld at IC Sports Centre at 6.30pm.

    "content": "FeliX This week and this issue has been hectic. I wish to\nadvise any future editor reading this-never do a photo story. They take hours to produce. Enough of\nthis tosh!\nChristmas accommodation\nSenior Assistant Finance Officer, Malcolm Aldridge,\nhas only served to confirm my fears of his future\ndeceitfulness over rent in halls. Earlier this term I suggested that rents would be affected by the\nCollege's risky purchase of a new hall last year; Olave\nHouse. The College promised not to incorporate this\ninto the general rent system since such a move would\nvastly inflate rents in other halls. This they continue\nto promise. If this pledge is as good as the one made\nover Christmas rents by Student Residence\nCommittee (SRCI, however, it won't last.\nFELIX contacted the Rector to ask him who would\nbe Chairing SRC in the future, now that Brian Levitt\nhas vacated the position. The Rector said he did not\nknow; this is interesting since he appoints the\nsuccessor at present. My fear is that he will appoint\none of his lackeys to the post, making the body\npowerless. After all, if the body that advises the\nRector on residences is chaired by his beloved\nappointee, what will it say against his wishes?\nThanks to the perverse thinking of the twisted little\nmoney man in Sherfield who goes under the name of\n' Mr Aldridge, students will now be kicked out of hall\nto make way for the big spending Christmas\nconference guests. Why do Mr Aldridge and Loretto\nO 'Callaghan, the Accommodation Officer, not take\nany notice of decisions made by the Student\nResidences Committee unless it suits them? They\nliked the idea of students paying for a week at\nChristmas before; now they just don't like the\nstudents staying in their rooms.\nWhilst I am on the subject, how much of a guarantee is there that students' possessions, stored\nin their rooms, will not be moved out to make way\nfor conference guests, when the letting s inevitably\nscrew up? The whole issue stinks of money grabbing\nin a pathetic attempt to make up for past and future\nclangers in student residences.\nLife Sciences\nI hope that students in Biology II enjoyed their\nimpromptu timetable change when the department\npanic ed over their visit.\nAlphabet\nWe have now reached the letter 'E' in the competition.\nThank you to the donor for last week's'D'. Next\nweek's letter is 'F'. We have a few entries for this,\nbut I am sure everybody can try harder to get things\nin a more ordered fashion in future. To spice the whole\nthing up a bit more, I am also accepting entries for\nthe letter 'M' next week, with this letter also rotating\neach week. It still seems difficult to get away from\n'A' but that's life, I guess.\nMeetings\nStaff meetings are now on Tuesday lunchtimes at\n1pm. Please pop along if you fancy getting involved.\nToday there will be a special meeting for those\ninterested or involved in reviews. We can get you into\nfilms and plays for nothing, as well as obtaining free\nbooks for review.\nCredits\nThanks to everybody this week for working until\nridiculous hours. Chris Stapleton is a mega-hero for\nstaying 'til 5.30am on Wednesday to help me with\nthe photo story. Andy Bannister is a hero for writing,\npasting and seemingly everything this week.

ISSN 1040-0711\nCouncil\nBy Andy Bannister\nCouncil is a traditional forum for the emergence of\nnew sabbatical candidates, and this one marked the\nfirst really serious moves on the part of six people.\nFirst to make a move was Athos Ritzbiscuit, who\nannounced his intention of running for president by\ntaking off his sunglasses to gasps of awe. The ploy\nstarted strongly, but rather petered out.\nNext to go was next years Hon Sec Events, Murray\nWilliamson, who not only appeared without shades,\nbut put in a further bid in the form of an unus ably ambiguous motion about paying people we already\npay, to do jobs they already do, but doing it differently.\nI think that was what he said...\nFour further contenders for unannounced posts\ncontented themselves with wearing dark glasses and\nletting off indoor fireworks. Actually, this was a relatively sensible way of registering a protest at the\nrecent decision of the non-smokers on Council to spoil\neveryone else's fun by banning the evil weed from the\nmeeting the moment the gloves came off.\nAnd to the business: the Greeks and the Cypriots\nhave been writing rude letters to the STA about the\nTurkish Cypriots. It only took half an hour to decide\nthat McCluskey was to write a rude letter to both the\nGreeks and the Cypriots, being rude about the Turks.\nThe debate was polite and to the point. More so than\nthe debate about Union vans, which managed to work\nout that if we buy some more, we might have to pay\nfor them, so people ought to book vans six months\nSketch\nin advance. This was presented as a move to\nmaximise the efficiency of usage of the van stocks.\nLogical? You bet.\nAt least one logical motion was passed on behalf\nof Dave Williams, which ended up saying that the\nsnack bar has walls, and that the Union lives in a grade\n2 listed building, so nobody should stick any. posters\non it. It seemed to make sense at the time, but the\nmeeting failed to reach any conclusion about precisely\nwhere anyone with a poster could stick it. Answers\non a postcard please...\nThe meeting did manage to reach a conclusion on\nthe subject of minutes. It decided that reading through\nthe minutes of the major Subcommittees, or MSCs\nin Councilspeak, which Council is supposed to oversee\nwould take a very long time, and Council members,\nfinding themselves in danger of having to do some\nwork, voted that one down smartly. In fairness, one\ncould see their point; Council meetings are after all\nlong enough, and any possibility of their continuing\npast bar closing time should be firmly stamped on.\nThere being no more sabbatical candidates, the\nmeeting was closed before anyone else could put their\noar in, and the assembled masses picked up their bags\nand lit cigarettes with an audible sigh of relief, before\nheading off to the bar to sun themselves in the\nreflected glory of membership of the Union's highest\nbody.\nST MARY'S HOSPITAL\nAMATEUR OPERATIC SOCIETY\npresents\nLITTLE SHOP\nOF HORRORS\nMonday 4th to Wednesday 6th December\nTickets: \u00a33.00\nTickets can be bought through Nick Stafford via St\nMary's internal mail system or through TC Station\nLtd (ticket agency) on 323 5481, or by credit card\n(24 hr) on 284 1221 (subject to 2 1 % booking fee)\nDEVELOPMENT\nOFFICE\nHELP WANTED\n\u00a33.14 per hour\nEVENINGS & WEEKENDS\nThe Development Office needs\nassistance with computer-data entry,\nresearch and filing.

My comments were\nbased on what I had seen at Hamlet Gardens last year,\nin order to update my experiences of those flats I will\nbe having a look around some of the flats with\nMatthew this week.\nWith reference to Willis Jackson House and the\nstories about its warden then I have this to say: I am\ngrateful to FELIX for bringing my attention to the\nproblems with the amenities accounts but I do\nsym pathis e with Joe Cartwright, the warden, to a certain extent. I myself sent a letter of reprimand to\nJoe Cartwright, this he took very well and on speaking\nto him and other wardens it is apparent that wardens\nare quite often left in the dark as to what their\nresponsibilities and duties are. Joe was in this position\nand has now learnt. I hope that this year the wardens\ncan get together and tie down some of their\nresponsibilities and duties and put them onto paper\nfor future use. I have heard very little from people in\nhalls of residence so I presume everything is going\nfairly well, if this is the case; congratulations to the\nwardens, the sub-wardens and the re-apps.\nPS. I hope I never hear again somebody suggesting\nremoving fire appliances from halls or head tenancies!!\nConferences\nKings College European Society and London Young\nEuropeans will be hosting a conference at the New\nTheatre, Kings College, London, tomorrow between\n10am and 5pm entitled '1992: Your Career'.

Now, this man is supposed\nto deal with ICU Deputy President, Dave Williams,\nwhen problems occur with Union facilities. Then Mr\nHagen sends the boys round to do the business.\nUsually this is OK. But with the issue of replacing\nthe Union Gym floor, which is to be carried out over\nthe Christmas hol s, thus affecting very few people,\nMr Hagen has been a little over-zealous. He assumed,\nwithout consulting Dave, that because we want to\nreplace the Union Gym floor, students obviously aren't using it!\nOn this basis he ordered the wood for the floor,\nthinking it could be stored in the Gym. This rather\nstupid assumption, backed up by lack of\ncommunication (how much does an internal phone call\ncost your department, lb?) has resulted in severe\ninconvenience to all the clubs that use the Union Gym\nfor the period up till the Christmas break, as there is\nno other place to store the wood.\nSorry, everyone, but gross incompetence strikes\nagain. Remember, when you work hard to build things\nup from below, it requires only one lapse for you to\nbe sh*t on from above.\n15 Page\n\n"

    "content": "Wembley Arena\nAnderson, Bruford,\nWakeman, Howe\nAnother re vitali sed 'supergroup'? Well, we've seen\nthem before haven't we? Deep Purple, The Who, even\nthe three survivors of Led Zeppelin stunning us at Live\nAid. And now A.B. W.H. For all the various legal\ncomplications, already well documented elsewhere,\nthe tickets were billed as 'An evening of Yes music'\nand if you have never heard a Yes album in your life,\nyou have more than likely heard them described by\nvarious so-called 'music journalists' as a pompous and\nself-indulgent ensemble of ego maniac musicians. It\nmay well be for this very reason that the solo spots\n(to many people, myself included, an integral part of\nsuch an event) were consigned to the opening fifteen\nminutes of the concert.\nAlthough most of the audience were there to hear\nthe old Yes pieces again, the re vitali sed band knew\nthey had to sell the new songs from the recent\nA.B. W.H. album in order to survive and prosper. But\nrepresenting such an immense track repertoire within\na254 hour set, and paying heed to the future is no\neasy task, and consequently the 90125/Generation\nmaterial was ignored. Long Distance Runaround was\nplayed a little more slowly than usual, and the absence\nof Chris Squire and his distinct Rickenbacker bass\nsound detracted from the piece. However, all the\nevident new technology did not betray the 70s sound;\nthe ballad And You and I was extended brilliantly with\na full orchestral sound.\nIn all fairness, it could have been better. The poor\nArena acoustics, coupled to a 'flying' PA system paid\ntoken justice to the band's huge sound and many Yes\nveterans told me that the lighting wasn't like the old\ndays either. But it's very easy to be blas e about such\nan event as this. Suffice it to say that my friends were\nall very impressed and some said it was the best\nthey've ever seen. This proves a very basic but\noverlooked point: at the end of the day, a group will\nnot be remembered for its image, publicity stunts and\nrecord sales, but by its music.\nChris M All About Eve\nScarlet & Other Stories\nScarlet and Other Stories is the album from All About\nEve. It's the follow-up to the album of the same name\nas the group which brought us such gems as Martha's Harbour a track which will always be remembered for\nJullianne Regan's refusal to mime along to it on Top\nof the Pops.\nThis is a fine album. From the first play it was a hit,\nthe reason being two-fold: Jullianne Regan's voice and\nthe many guitar styles of Tim Bicheno. Ms Regan is\ntruly blessed with a stunning voice. Not only is it\nmelodic but it has depth and character. It sounds\nchildlike one moment and is charged with emotion and\nmaturity the next. Accoustic and electric guitar as well\nas banjo playing are very well thought out, forming\nthe most important aspect of the soundtrack.\nPowerful percussion and supporting bass complete\nthe sound.\nIf any criticism were to be placed it would be that\nthis album could get tedious with overplaying.\nInfluences are clearly a mixture of 70s and 80s rock\nsuch as Genesis, Led Zeppelin, Marillion, Mike\nOldfield, Iron Maiden and The Mission.\nThe track which has to stand out is Road to Your\nSoul which is beautiful and stunning. Credit has to go\nto Paul Samwell-Smith for excellent production.\nPage 6\nPowerhaus\nColourblind James Experience,\nThe Veldt, God's Little Monkeys\nCountry and Western: You might love it, you probably\nhate it, but you can't ignore it. Not tonight anyway.\nThe stuff is pumping out of the PA at no mean volume,\nhoary old classic after hoary old classic. Everyone\nknows the words-it's that sort of crowd.\nHalfway into REM's Rockville, York's finest God's Little Monkeys bound on stage with a new album,\nNew Maps of Hell. A European tour behind them, this\nlot are full of confidence and it shows. Despite a few\nproblems (a lost voice and lack of sleep thanks to a 'bloody awful' ferry crossing) they treat us to an\nelectrifying half hour of folk rock, then they're gone\nand the place fills with country fave s again.\nThe Veldt are from North Carolina. 'Hi', they tell us,\n'we're from North Carolina'. 'Ha!', we think, 'a country ish band, I 'll be bound'. The Veldt then tell us\nthey think country is crap and launch into some of the\nbest white indie noise I 've heard in ages. The trip\nstarts somewhere between Ar Kane and The\nTelescopes and pays service to just about every other\nbliss ed out feedback/noise band you'd care to\nmention on the way. With an album out in February\n[Cocteau Twins and Ar Kane connections,\napparently), the Veldt look set to steel the thunder of\nthe best in British indie. The next big thing?\nWhat exactly is the Colourblind James Experience!\nImagine an unlikely looking bunch of blok es churning\nout a warped, loony-toon country blues. Imagine a big\nfat acoustic bass, trombones, clarinets, xylophones.\nImagine Colourblind James himself, a latter-day\nBeefheart, tongue inserted firmly in cheek as he\nrelates quirky tales of America from a big black book.\nThis is the experience. It's infectious and the crowd\nget happy and love it. Considering a move to\nMemphis? You bet!\nGraham Lamlor.\nUnion Lounge\nBliss-FELIX interview\nBliss have been together for the past three years. Their\npresent live line-up is, to say the least, musically\ncomprehensive, comprising lead and backing vocals,\nguitarist, bassist, drummer, keyboards as well as\nviolins.\nCast in shades of blue and red Bliss played their\nhearts out. The urgency they put into their music was\nclear for everybody to see. Excellent vocals were\ncoupled with steady drumming and some quite\nwonderful hammond organ keyboard playing to\nprovide a sound which was never tiring to the ears.\nThe sound quality was good and credit should be\nplaced not only with the band, but also with the Ents\nteam for this.\nThe audience response was extremely well natured\nwith an air of enjoyment clearly present. The band\nreturned for encores, despite me nearly unplugging\none of the PA power lines in the FELIX Office to plug\nthe kettle in.\nAfter the concert I managed to grab a few words\nwith the very attractive figure of lead vocalist Rachel\nMorrison, despite their tiring performance and\nintensive schedule ahead.\nThe emphasis in the band on Rachel is very definite,\nwith her singing brimming over with expression and\nemotion. Exhaustion is a problem and she claimed that\nwith the intensive schedule ahead, she is going to\nhave to be careful.\nBliss are not well known in the UK but feel that with\nhard work and patience they will achieve success.\nThis is a contrast to Italy where they are quite popular,\nplaying large venues and cultivating their own fan\nfollowing. After this they have found it difficult playing\nin smaller British college venues where the audience\nis practically on top of the band. Rachel does not enjoy\nthis intimacy claiming: 'You have to concentrate much\nharder and at times can be put off by being able to\nhear comments the front row are making'. Despite\nthis, the very nature of these gigs makes them more\nrewarding if you captivate an audience.\nHaving covered venues in England, Wales and\nScotland, they have found southern England venues\nless responsive, whereas the far northern England\nvenues tend to be rowdy, with drunken ess and wolf\nwhistling being a common feature. This is ascribed to\nthe availability of cheap beer in student unions,\ntogether with the fact that they go on stage late in\nthe evening.\nTheir live work has greatly influenced their studio\nrecording technique. Rachel feels the urge to 'hold the\nmicrophone in the studio' and to use first time takes\non the LP rather than trying again or overdubbing.\nThe roots of their music is set in the soul, gospel\nstyle of the 60s, drawing inspiration from soul and\nblues artists like Van Morrison. There is an optimistic\nair about their future but little optimism for the music\nindustry as a whole. With their stage presence and\nvery competent musicianship Bliss have a bright\nfuture. They are at a very important stage in their\ncareers and they clearly are trying hard. It will be of\ngreat interest to see whether they succeed. It would\nbe a shame to waste such talent especially with\ntalent less Australian soap stars topping the charts-no names mentioned! Many thanks to Chris Stapleton\nfor some fine photographs.\nN.E.

    "content": "FELIX interviews rising ex-indie band The Wedding Present\nPast, present and future\nThe Wedding Present emerged from darkest Leeds\nsome five years ago. Their frenetic guitars and\nbittersweet songs proved immensely popular and the\ngroup rose steadily to become one of the biggest indie-bands in the country. After a succession of fine singles\nand an excellent debut album, George Best, they\ndropped their indie status by signing to RCA records\nand have just released a new album, Bizzarro. Richard\nCrouch, Susan Appleby and City of London Poly's Laurence Brewere spoke to David Gedge and Peter\nSalowka, of the band, at the Kilburn National\nBallroom.\nWedding Present are not your favourite group, and it's a bit outside your taste in music, I'm sure the two LPs\nare going to sound very similar. In the same way, to\nme I'm sure all eight Simple Minds LPs are going to\nsound similar. But for me Bizarro's completely\ndifferent.\nR.C: What number did Kennedy, the single from\nthe album, reach in the charts?\nD. G: It came in at 34 and zoomed up to 33. If it kept\non going at that rate, we'd have been Number One\nby March!\nR.C: What made you decide to sign with a major? R.C: Were you on Top of the Pops?\nD. G: Without trying to sound too pompous or\nbig headed about it, I think we were just getting too\nbig for an independent label. It was our own label,\nReception Records, which was distributed by the\nCartel, and we just found it was really difficult to get\nrecords to the people who wanted them, especially\nabroad. We wanted a more efficient service, really.\nR.C: Were there many majors after you?\n. D. G:I'd be hard pressed to name a major who we\nhaven't talked to, but we've been quite hard to get,\nI think. We saw different people and as soon as we\nfound out what kind of contract we wanted, most of\nthem said no.\nR.C: Why is Bizarro named after an old Superman\nvillain? Did you know about that?\nD. G: No, not really. It was pure coincidence. I was\nreading an old Superman comic the other day, and I noticed after the word Bizarro on the cover it had TM\nin a little circle, so I think we'll probably get sued for it!\nP.S: Is it spelt differently?\nD. G: No, it's the same.\nP.S: Shit, the end of a promising career, that!\nL.B: How do you think the new LP compares to\nGeorge Best?\nP.S: It's better, but then we're bound to say that! If\nwe've just spent weeks in the studio and we came\nout with something we didn't think was better than\nsomething we did three years ago, we wouldn't be\nhere now.\nD. G: You do feel a bit pretentious talking about it,\nbecause every group you ask what's the new LP like?\nthey're all going to say 'Oh yeah, it's really good, go\nout and buy it', but unfortunately we do believe it's a really good LP. And we didn't with George Best.\nR.C: How do you respond to the criticisms of lack\nof progression?\nP.S: Well, what do they want us to do ?\nD. G: For me they're unfounded. I think in many ways\nit depends on how closely you follow the group. If the\nD. G: In between Sabrina and the Pet Shop Boys, I believe. A snapshot of us! We had a sweepstake for\nwhat number the single would be; we got everyone\nto pay a quid, and my girlfriend won it. Did quite well,\nactually.\nmoney out of it, couldn't we?\nP.S:I was just thinking we might be looking back on\nthis when we're about 50, in a little beds it in Leeds...\nD. G:... thinking 'Why didn't we do it! Why didn't we\nsell out!'\nR.C: How do you think your music translates from\nthe small clubs you used to play to these\ncavernous venues like Kilburn?\nD. G: It doesn't really, I don't think. For me, probably\nthe most disappointing thing about being successful\nis that you've got to play these big venues where, as\nyou know, the atmosphere is pretty well non-existant.\nYou feel like a pop-star, which I don't really want to\nbe. Kilburn isn't too bad because it gives the\nimpression of being a bit smaller and more intimate,\nbut we've played some places on this tour where the\nstage is bigger than most of the venues we've played\nin the past. There's loads and loads of space and you\njust feel like Genesis, or something.\nL.B: Do the Kennedy lyrics represent a change in\napproach away from the usual love songs you\nwrite?\nD. G: Oh yeah, obviously. Well, I 've had a go at a few\ndiferent things before, but they've always been\nrubbish, to be honest. They've always been the fourth\ntrack on the 12\". I'm still not completely happy with\nKennedy's lyrics. There were reams and reams of\nwriting that got pared down to two verses, and Keith,\nthe bassist, thought it was really good, so I decided\nto stick with it. I think the song's good, but I'm happiest writing about things I know about, really. I don't know much about Kennedy or conspiracy\ntheories, it was just interesting to think about for a while.\nR.C: Is there some sort of agreement within the\nband that you handle all the songwriting?\nP.S: He's better at it than anybody else is!\nD. G: Not better, they're just lazy!\nL.B: You did an LP of Ukrainian music which is\ntotally different to the other two LPs.\nD. G: Oh yeah, that's Pete's fault, that.\nP.S: That doesn't really fall into the same category\nas the other two, though.\nD. G: It doesn't count!\nR.C: Were you surprised when it took off?\nD. G: To be honest, no I wasn't because it's something\nthat's got novelty appeal. A lot of people who\nwouldn't normally like the Wedding Present liked it.\nRCA loved it. They wanted us to release Those Were\nthe Days.\nP.S: They could have hyped it into the charts.\nD. G: Oh no! Can you imagine having a Number One\nrecord with it, y 'know, get Mary Hopkins for the video\nand all the rest of it. We could have made a lot of\nR.C: How is such an essentially British band\nreceived when you tour abroad?\nP.S:A lot of the people who come to see us tend to\nbe British people who are actually over there.\nD. G: Soldiers, isn't it? Especially in Germany.\nP.S: Yeah, or in Spain it's people who teach English\nas a foreign language. It's like a British evening out!\nD. G: The Dutch don't really see us because they're\nstoned out of their heads. They're there, but they're\nnot aware of anything going on. We're on stage\nplaying this really fast music, and they're just going,\nclap...clap...clap. It's weird!\nS. A: What are your immediate ambitions? What\ndirections will you be shooting off in?\nD. G: People tend to disbelieve me, but I 've really got\nno ambitions for the near future-my ambition was\nto make a better LP than George Best, and I think\nwe've done that. I'm thinking of writing new songs\nnow, but we haven't got any real plans apart from to\ndo this tour, then go to Europe, and then release an\nEP next year.\nR.C: Have you ever thought about when you want\nto end this, or do you want to carry on forever like\nthe Fall?\nD. G:I go through phases of it, but I genuinely can't imagine not being in a group anymore.There would\nbe...not so much sadness, more like nothing-it's irreplaceable. I love the position that I'm in, but there's times that I hate it as well, and I don't want to be\ndoing it when I'm40, like Mick Jagger. It's a real\nparadox, because part of me says 'you've got to set\na limit on it', and there's another part of me saying\n'but why? I'm enjoying it now more than ever!' It does\nget easier when you're bigger. It would be a shame\nto finish now after struggling for the first 2 or 3 years\nand at last being satisfied with it.\nPage 5\n\n"

    "content": "Thefirstinternational summer school on science and world affairs saw representatives from Moscow, Prince\nand Imperial College London. Vinita Khanna reports....\nExploding myths and\npenetrating warheads\nPeople in power prop their ideologies up with densely\nwoven myths. Scientists are trained to debunk: occassionally they penetrate deceit; even more\noccasionally they succeed in making changes. Today, changes in the Soviet Union are being driven by many forces. One of which appears to be the new class of\nscientifically literate and politically aware pragmatists\nsweeping to power as President Gorbachev sweeps out the old decaying ger on to c racy. Scientists at the Physico Technical Institute in\nMoscow recently hosted the First International\nSummer School on Science and World Affairs, as a step to consolidate the position of scientists in the political process. The school covered topics ranging from the Greenhouse Effect, Chernobyl, comprehensive test\nbans, the nuclear winter, and ballistic missile\nproliferation. Chinese and Soviet students had their\nfirst chance to hear Western lecturers (from Imperial\nCollege and Princeton), and meet with Western students. Westerners were, in turn, confronted with a reality hugely at variance with the myths which our\nmilitary-industrial leadership so carefully nurture.\nWM0{M$ if::: li|i^| il;\nAcademician Roald Sagdeev with other prominent Soviet, British and\nAmerican experts.\n*Myth: Scientists should be on tap, but not on top\nAcademic Roald Sag de ev, Gorbachev' s Science Advisor is an example who' son tap, and appears to be getting on top. Academic Andrei Koko shin is\nanother; he broke off a meeting with Boris Yeltsin\n( Gorbachev' s radical opponent) to teach on Reductions in Nuclear Arsenals. Many of the problems\nwe now face are merely the result of misplaced technical expertise, yet to solve them we need\npolitical will. Political will can be forced by technical\narguments. Today major changes in the world's political systems are shifting the balance of power. Our environment is creaking with ozone depletion,\npollution and acid rain. Temperatures are set to rise\nby amounts equal to the rises since the last ice age.\nWe face the fact that countries perpetually in the world's hot-spots are about to acquire nuclear\nweapons and advanced delivery systems. \u2022 Myth: Gorbachev is impregnable, popular and we\nin the West need do nothing: Our Soviet colleagues\nmade it clear that since the last party congress, and\nwith increasing nationalist unrest, Gorbachev' s popularity has plummet ted. It is said that Mrs Thatcher would probably beat him in a free election.\nThe forces of conservative and military reaction are\nstill in place and if they were to regain their old power then East West relations would soon be back in the\nIce Age. We ought to respond to the repeated\ninitiatives from the Eastern bloc or we cut away the\nground from the forces pushing change. If we do nothing, we risk the future. At the moment, the Soviet\nUnion is hardly capable of invading the West. Indeed,\nthe cuts in the oft-claimed Soviet superiority in conventional forces mean that a Soviet blitzkrieg\nWestwards would be impossible without several\nweeks of highly visible military buildup.\n9 Myth: Global warming is still unproven; action now\nwould be precipitous. Dr Jeremy Leggett covered the\nGreenhouse problem in detail. He demonstrated that\nPage 1 2\nthe correlation between atmospheric C02 and temperature is remarkable. Natural processes will only\nmake things worse. For example, it seems most bios ph eric Greenhouse gases are currently locked up\nin the permafrost. Once that starts to melt, the temperature runs away. If we wait for more facts, by the time we get round to making changes it'll be too\nlate. Recent UK expenditure on Greenhouse research\ncame to \u00a3 1 0 m, about one thousandth of that spent\non weapons programmes like Trident: systems that\ncan never be used, deter nothing and do not work. \u2022 Myth: Global warming means we need to expand\nthe use of ne clear energy. Another myth put together\nand supported by vested interests. Leggett claimed,\nwith the backing of senior Soviet experts, that since\ncoal burning accounts for only 1 0 % of Greenhouse gases, replacing it with nuclear energy not only does\nnot solve the problem but distracts us from real\nsolutions. For the developing world, it would mean building one Chernobyl-sized reactor every few days.\nLeggett paraphrased Woody Allen. Mankind faces a choice: there are two paths, and one path leads to misery, deprivation and abject horror, and the other\nleads to extinction. Most lecturers seemed optimistic\nthat we would choose the first.\n9Myth: Arms controllers hate nuclear weapons.\nWrong, they love them. They love talking mega tonnage, deep penetration aids, escalation\ndominance, use-it-or-lose-it, like any healthy young men. They know all about the jargon used to mystify,\nand the arcane physics around which the debate swirls. There seems to be a problem here, in that to get credibility and contacts in the world of arms control, you need to work with people and concepts from the days of the arms race.\n9Myth: A test ban is not verifiable. A lot of people\nin the West, particularly in the US and the UK, don't want a nuclear test ban. The un verifiability of a nuclear test ban hinges on the idea that a treaty has\nto be 1 0 0 % verifiable in all conditons to be useful. In\nreality, a Comprehensive Test Ban probably is verifiable, according to several Soviet and American experts at the School and verification technologies are\ncertainly good enough for the risk of being caught while cheating to be unacceptably high. So who is\nstopping the CT BT? Lookout for the debate intensifying over the next year, when countries like\nArgentina and Iran will be urging countries like the UK and the USA to be responsible with their nuclear\nweapons. \u2022 Myth: the problems cannot get worse. It was a characteristic of many of the lectures, from whatever side, that problems affecting just a handful of countries now could soon be causing problems for\nmany. Even environmental problems like CFC production (in that many developing countries import\nthese Greenhouse gases) are soluble if action is taken\nright away. Physicists shook their heads at this, and\nused phrases like 'multi particle dynamics' and looked\nworried.\n\n"

    "content": "Beer festival\ntrouble\nTrouble flared at the Beer Festival on Wednesday,\nafter an incident over the shortage of festival beer\nglasses. IC Rag Chairman, Hal Calamvokis, told\nFELIX that the beer and glasses ran out by 9.30pm this year.\nMr Calamvokis said that they had bought 1150 beer\nglasses this year\u2014a record number\u2014and had sold all\nof them , including those left over from last year. He\ncalculated that \u00a33000 had been raised from beer and\nglasses alone. On average, he added, each person\ndrank 4.7 pints. There were more people this year\nthan last, he said.\nTrouble started at 9:45 after more people turned\nup though all the glasses and beer had been sold. Two\nyoung men, described as 'about 5' 11' with short, dark\nhair' and 'with glasses and very blond hair' probably\nfrom Mechanical Engineering and 'third years or\npretending to be third years' tried various ruses to\nobtain glasses, for instance saying theirs had been\nstolen or broken.\nAfter this failed they resorted to stealing glasses\nfrom members of the RCS, and these members then\nturned them out. They tried twice to get back in.\nIn the morning it was discovered that many rag\nposters had been torn from walls. Hal Calamvokis\nclaimed that this amounted to a loss of about \u00a3100\nin publicity. Though he conceded that the wind may\nhave been responsible for some of this, he was sure\nthat the cleaners had not 'blitzed' the walls, and some\nof the blame lay with these troublemakers . During\nthe night the glass cabinet reserved for college welfare\nnotices at the Electrical Engineering end of the\nSherfield walkway was smashed. Mr Calamvokis\nthought these two may have been responsible for this\nas 'generally they were vandals'.\nFive tickets for rag week went missing , valued at\n\u00a316 each, though these were returned the next day.\nHe concluded by saying there had not been as much\nvomiting as usual and the mens conveniences had not\nbeen trashed as they usually were, probably becuase\nwhen the beer ran out the revellers went elsewhere\nto continue drinking. ' Next year we will hopefully\nhave 800 pints more and more glasses', he added.T was stone-cold sober.and I went home alone.'\nCommunity\nnews\nMr Peter Mee, College Registrar, is in the process\nof sending letters on Poll Tax registration to all full-time students at IC. The letter is to reassure them that\nhe will be giving only the minimum information to\nlocal authorities, following the statutory requirements\nfor the poll tax (or community charge).\nAccording to law, the college need only disclose\nstudents' names and term-time addresses, although,\nMr Mee said, certain authorities had asked for more\ninformation. He told FELIX 'We hold a lot of\ninformation\u2014previous schools etc. I am giving the\nabsolute minimum to them.'\nHe explained that he thought that Borough Councils\nmay take a census of their area and^may expect\nstudents to present themselves to the council offices\nwith the registrar's certificate as proof of where they\nare currently studying. He stressed that according to\nthe Department of the Environment practice notes,\nno student is required to part with the certificate at\nany time.\nPaper planes\nOn Tuesday 14th November, paper plane makers\nfrom all over college will have a chance to practice\ntheir art at the Annual Paper Aeroplane Competition.\nThe planes will be launched from the Union Building\nfrom 1.30pm. Entry is 50p with an additional lOp for each flight.\nAll the money will go to Great Ormond Street\nHospital. Prizes include 3 books from Dillons\nbookshop, jigsaws from the Science Museum, 3 free\nvideo hires from IC Bookstore, a free haircut, a parrot-on-a spring, dinosaur or zebra mug and animal\npuzzles from the Natural History Museum.\nAll the entries must be on paper of less than A3\nsize, and the winners will have the fruits of their\nlabours displayed in the bookshop in the Science\nMuseum.\nAnyone interested in entering should contact\nAndrew Chipling on extension 4748.\nPrizes!\nProspective honours graduates in Chemistry or\nChemical Engineering who are in their final year have\nbeen offered the chance to win \u00a3700.\nThe ten such prizes are being made by the 'Salters\nInstitute of Industrial Chemistry', and are given on\nthe basis of 'the candidates potential....to occupy a leading position in the UK chemical industry'.\nThe head of each related department can nominate\nonly one candidate.\nUFC visit\nStudent timetables were unexpectedly rearranged on\nThursday as Imperial received its five-yearly visit\nfrom the University Funding Council (UFC). Council\nrepresentatives visited the Civil Engineering and\nBiology departments.\nCollege had known that the visit was due for some\nwhile although no-one appeared to know of the\nCouncil's exact plans. This, explained Professor Roy\nAnderson, Head of the Department of Biology, was\nwhy changes were made to lectures and lab work at\nvery short notice; second year undergraduates from\nProfessor Anderson's department, who were\nexpecting a lecture on 'Comparison of Plant and\nAnimal Physiology', unexpectedly found themselves\ndoing practical work. The delegation had specifically\nasked to see a practical group at work.\nSPORTS RESULTS\nSaturday 2 8 th October\nFOOTBALL QM C0 IC- - 3\nQM C111 IC II--1\nIC III-O Charring X2 IC V2 IC IV-- 0\nPlease note: Correction from previous table:\nSt Thomas 11-0 IC VI--1\nHOCKEY\nMens\nIC-2 Righing's Park--2\nIC 11-2 Richings Park II--2\nIC III\nLadies\nIC-0 Goldsmiths--0\nWednesday 1st November\nFOOTBALL (U.

The report, from the Cabinet Office Science\nand Technology Unit, predicts that funding will drop\nfrom its 1987/88 level of \u00a34616m to \u00a34282m by\n1991 /92. Britain's Science spending, as a proportion\nof the country's wealth, is already lagging well behind\nits competitors and the predicted changes will knock\nthis back by another 30%.\nThe report also revealed that of the 11,835\nscientists who graduated in 1987, only a quarter took\nup jobs in research and half went into finance, law and\nadministration. Engineers were more loyal with over\n70% staying with their subject.\n\u2022 Health agencies in the USA and Europe are\nattempting to allay fears of a connection between\ngenetically engineered human insulin and the deaths\nof several insulin-dependant diabetics from\nhypo gly cae mia. Hypoglycaemia is a reaction to\nexcessively high levels of insulin and has many\nphysically uncomfortable recognisable symptoms.\nHowever there is anecdotal evidence that these\neffects are less severe and less likely to be noticed\nfor an human insulin surplus than for animal based\ninsulin.\nAs yet there is no scientifically established link\nbetween insulin type and symptoms and, although\nthere have been a number of surveys of diabetics,\nnone have produced conclusive results.\n\u2022 Indian meteorologists have developed a method\nfor accurately predicting the behaviour of the annual\nmonsoon so vital for the country. Their model is\nsimplistic and provides only qualitative results yet is\nsaid to be able to predict whether the monsoon will\nbe good or bad up to 2 months ahead.\n\u2022 The Japanese Government has agreed to a total\nban on all Ivory imports. Japan is the world's largest\nimporter of ivory and the decision has been\ncondemned by the 'legal' ivory trading countries such\nas South Africa. It may be entirely coincidental that\nJapan will be hosting the 1991 meeting of the\nConvention on International Trade in Endangered\nSpecies.\nEnvironmentalists will be less pleased to hear that\ndespite recent protests Japanese fishermen will\ncontinue to use drift nets.

    "content": "Opens 22nd December\nThe Return of Swamp Thing\nAdapted from the original DC comic story, this is a light-hearted good versus evil movie, though for a12 certificate, it has some scary moments.\nThe swamp thing, played by Dick Durock for the\nsecond time, used to be brilliant scientist Alec Holland\nuntil he was turned into a vegetable by the evil Dr\nArcane and his assistant Dr Zurrell (played by Louis\nJourdan and Sarah Douglas, famous as Ursa in\nSuperman). Swamp thing retained the intelligence and\nemotions of Alec but ashamed of his appearance he\nlives in solitude in the swamp until he meets Abigail.\nAbigail is Arcane's step-daughter played by Heather\nLocklear from Dynasty. In the film she investigates the\nmysterious death of her mother only to fall foul of\nArcane's mad experiments on an immortality serum\nfor which she has the correct rare blood type (as did\nher mother).\nSwamp thing comes to Abby's rescue more than\nonce and slowly she falls in love with the man behind\nthe gunk. Arcane, however, has other ideas, but\nalthough he destroys them both during the film, true\nlove pulls them through. As for Arcane, well that's for the inevitable sequel.\nSo if you're a fan of DC comics or if you just want\nsome light evening's entertainment, The Return of\nSwamp Thing is for you.\nToby.\nTwo Moon Junction\nHe knows she is engaged. He also knows that whilst\nthe fiance might make a superbly clean-cut and\nrespectable husband, loved by her wealthy daddy and\nhimself alike, her obvious sexual hypertension could\nonly really be satisfied by Him: the sweat-glistening\nrough guy, waving a sledgehammer at fairground tent\npegs to kill the time between brawls and bottles of\nBourbon.\nThe director of this film makes no bones about it\nbeing based on the same idea as 9'A Weeks. So you\ncan guess what will happen. She wants him, he\nknows it, and is prepared to let her beg. Unlike its\nsister movie, however, much of this is blazing ly unsubtle-the principal actors are both symbols of\nPage 4\nsexuality, the camera work is much more open than\nin 9% Weeks, lessening the sensation of erotic\nt it il ation for a far more earthy bum-and-tits production.\nIn between the s lagging and the shagging there is\na real story going on -probably to make up for the recasting of the kitchen fridge as a humble video\nrecorder and it cannot be denied that certain humanist\ntouches came across, not least the obvious angst to\ndo with her forthcoming marriage, although, on the\nwhole, this was purely an excuse to get your nerve\nendings tingling and to sit there wishing you dared\nbehave like that. And why not, indeed?\nPaul Darby.\nGreat Balls\nof fire\nThis film chronicles the rise of Jerry Lee Lewis (the\n'Killer'), from his early inspiration, listening to\nforbidden 'nigger music', to the point where he is a contender for the crown as 'King of Rock 'n' Roll'\nwhen Elvis is drafted. It also tells of his subsequent\nfall into obscurity when an English reporter-a superb\ncameo by Peter Cook-discovers that Lewis has\nbigamous ly married his thirteen year old second\ncousin, twice removed.\nThe film's major fault is that it never finds itself a style, careering between a love story, a Good/Evil\nparable and a musical, with some scenes jarring badly\nwith those that precede them. This is partially\ncompensated for by the sheer enthusiasm that runs\nthrough the whole film, mostly emanating from Denis\nQuaid who plays Lewis as a manic, posturing,\nimmature egotist whose only real redeeming features\nare his talent at the piano and his devotion to his child\nbride. The film implies that the only reason this\nrelationship survives is that each is as childish as the\nother-witness the bubblegum 'kissing' scene.\nThe acting, on the whole is good, although both\nsouthern and English accents are occasionally over\nplayed\u2014especially the 'cockney porter' in the tour of\nEngland sequence (notable for a short pan down\nPrince Consort Road).\nThe period detail is well maintained too, although\nin one or two of the shots of London you feel that you\nhave seen something that you weren't supposed to.\nThe songs, re-recorded for the film by Lewis\nhimself, keep your feet tapping throughout and even\nhelp sustain the rather limp ending-Lewis having not\ndone the producers a favour by dying early but instead\nliving to a rather obscure middle-age.\nThe film makes for a good evening's entertainment,\nbut if you want a more serious look at the life of Lewis\nread his wife's book.\nAdam Tinworth.\n\n"

    "content": "Students' rights to stay in Hall at Christmas? 'No\u2014they've got no rights\nanyway. '\u2014Senior Assistant Finance Officer, Malcolm Aldridge\nSouthside sold out\nStudents of Southside and Linstead halls\nhave no guarantee that they can live in hall\nover Christmas, according to Mr. Malcolm Aldridge of the Finance\nDepartment at IC.\n'No student is entitled to residence in\nhall', he stated, though he said there would\nbe no problem except in the above\nmentioned halls, where only half the\nrooms were available for students. Priority\nwould be given to overseas students who\nhad to stay he said. In the minutes to the\nstudents residence comit tee( SRC) of last\nNovember it states that 'all students would\ncontinue to pay one weekly rent for the\nChristmas break, which would entitle\nthem to leave their posses ions in the room\nand occupy it for seven days'.\n'A lot of water has gone under the\nbridge since then', said Mr Aldridge. He\nadmitted that they might break this rule students may have to remove their luggage\nto storerooms if rooms cannot be found\nfor the Christmas conferences. Last\nChristmas had no conferences so the\nproblem didn't arise. Mr Aldridge said\nthat if the halls became overcrowded they\nwould advertise in Felix for rooms in other\nhalls for the displaced students.\nHe added that 'we have a contractual\nobligation to the conferences which we\ncannot back down from; we have no\nobligation to the students\u2014they may be\nrequired to vacate a room' .On being\npressed if students had a right to stay in\ntheir rooms if they so wished he replied\n'No\u2014they've got no rights anyway.'\nAn additional rule this year is that\nstudents must pay rent at the normal rate\nfor all the Christmas holiday, and not just\nfor one week getting the rest of the holiday\nrent free, as with last year. Mr Aldridge\nconcluded ' I cannot give a cast iron\nguarantee to please everybody'\nMs Loretto O 'Callaghan, of the\nAccomodation Office, declined to\ncomment on most of the questions, but\nsaid that problems were unlikely to arise\nas not very many students usually stayed\nover Christmas, though she admitted that\nthere was the possibility of difficulties.\nDr John Hassard, warden of Tizard and\nSelkirk Halls also said that not that many\nstudents would want to stay, so no clash\nwould occur.\nProfessor New , warden of FalmouthKeogh hall said 'it's highly likely that it's all a storm in a tea cup.' He said that the\nnumber of rooms needed was 'not all that\ngreat.' 'It's not an ideal situation,' he said,\n'everybody realises it's a compromise'\nIC's Director of Undergraduate Studies becomes first local councilor to instigate\nClause 28 of Government bill\nGlad to be Levitt\nICs director of Undergraduate Studies, Dr\nBryan Levitt, is behind Kensington and\nChelsea Borough Councils plans to be the\nfirst London council to use the\ncontroversial 'Clause 28' against its\nhomosexual community. The clause, from\nthe recent Conservtive Local Government\nAct, explicitly forbids local councils from\nopenly 'promoting' homosexuality. It has\nbeen con demme d by civil liberties groups\nwho claim that it gives too much room for\nprejudice.\nThe council has decided to stop funding\nthe 'Notting Hill Lesbian and Gay Youth\nGroup' apparently without consulting any\nof its members or any outside specialists.\nDr Levitt believes that the group promotes\nhomosexuality at an age when people are\nstill unsure of their sexual preferences,\nadding that he 'wouldn't want to\nencourage sexual experience for anyone\nunder the age of 18'. Despite this, he\nclaimed to be aware of his own\nheterosexuality at the age of 16, but said\nthat was different.\nImperial College Welfare Officer,\nJackie Scott, told FELIX that at t it ute s towards homosexuals at IC had 'improved\ndramatically over the last few years' and\nsaid it was worrying that a key member\nof college could apparently hold such\n'narrow minded opinions'\n\n"

    "content": "\u2022 Myth: Soviets deny Arms Treaty Violations. Some\ndo: we asked our Soviet students if they thought the\nKrasnoyarsk phased-array radar violated the ABM\ntreaty. Some nervously said that they had never heard\nof it; most thought it was OK, including one who lived\nin its shadow in the Siberian Steppes. Then academic\nSagdeev stepped up and blew it for his junior\ncolleagues. Yes, of course it violated the ABM treaty,\ndamm it, and it was a stupid mistake which will cost\nover 1 bn roubles to put right. But why had the US\nwaited until Reagan's Star Wars speech to point it out,\nwhen they'd known about it for ages?\n\u2022 Myth: Military and political needs drive the arms\nrace. Wrong. Ted Taylor, from the US and an expert\nin weapon development, claimed that the weapon\ndevelopers in bath blocs make new gadgets first, then\ntake them to their political and military masters, like\na dog with a bone. 'Do you want it?' they ask, and\nthe answer is always 'Yes'. Take penetrating\nwarheads: An exciting technology which allows the\ntar getting of underground bunkers and command and\ncontrol cent es. Strategically, they are of dubious\nutility: in a nuclear exchange, probably the last thing\nyou want to do is kill the people who can stop the\nthing. But the technology is very exciting, and is\nattracting big funding.\n*Myth: Mankind learns from science. Maybe, but\nwith a delay of centuries. Academic Sergei Kapitza,\nhead of the Moscow Institute of Physical Problems,\nworries that too few politicians know any science.\nPolitics, he claims, has yet to reach the statistical\nphysics and thermodynamics of the 19th century, let\nalone the non-linear dynamics, turbulence and chaos\nof our century. It's firmly rooted in Newtonian action-reaction. The solution? Scientists must force\nthemselves, if not to leave their ivory towers, at least\nto start shouting from them.\n*Myth: cockroaches are different from people.\nUnfortunately, from a chemical toxicity point of view,\nit's all too easy to convert pesticide plants to chemical\nweapons plants, claimed a key Soviet ex-worker in\nthis field. The US decision to continue with binary\nweapons even if a treaty is in place was no surprise.\nBut don't despair: unlike cockroaches, people can\nlearn to cooperate, to inspect each other's plants. We\nmust, he concluded, or we bequeath our world to\nthem.\n*Myth: God has no place in Soviet Society. Wrong.\nWe saw many demonstrating Ukrainian Catholics\narousing much benign interest in Arbatskaya (a sort\nof Covent Garden Market). We visited Orthodox\nseminaries. Our translator dismissive ly claimed that\nthere were only 70 or 80 million practising Christians\nin the Soviet Union. One Soviet nuclear physicist\nclaimed that God had made the half-life of Tritium,\nneeded for H bombs, only 12 years so as to set the\npace of nuclear disarmament.\n*Myth: Soviet students don't know what the state\ndoesn't want them to know. They knew about\nChernobyl, and how to organise protests. They knew\nabout, and largely approved of, the Nationalist\nmovements in the Baltic, especially in so far as they\nare environmentalists. They knew about acid rain, and\nthe damage to their forests. They also knew about\nAcid House and Heavy Metal, though all seemed to\nprefer the Beatles. One even knew about credit cards\nand Euroyen forward exchange rates.\nAnd that's the way it's all going.\nVinita Khanna\nUK participation was funded by Imperial College and\nthe British Council. Views expressed here do not\nnecessarily reflect those of either organisation. The\nSecond International Summer School on Science and\nWorld Policy will be held in Washington DC next July.\nChanging over to nuclear fuels may not be an answer to the greenhouse\neffect. To use less energy may. be a better solution\nNuclear illusions in the\ngreenhouse windows\nEver since the 'green' conversion of the Government\nwe have been repeatedly told that the best way to\nreduce C02 emission is by a massive expansion of the\nnuclear power industry. It is undoubtedly true that\nproducing electricity with nuclear fuel does release\nless C02( and other greenhouse gases) into the\natmosphere, but by concentrating on this point alone\nwe are only looking at one part of a multi-faceted\nproblem and so could unwittingly increase the\ngreenhouse effect.\nThe main problem with the pro-nuclear solution is\nthat carbon dioxide from coal fired power stations only\nconstitutes 10% (approx) of the total produced on\nearth. So even if we converted completely to nuclear\npower the larger contributions from transport, oil and\ngas combustion (20% +) deforestation (approx 20%)\nand CFC's(14%) and, amusing as it may sound,\n'farting' animals, combined with rice paddies and pipe\nleakage, (18%), would remain unchanged.\nLooked at in this light the nuclear power debate\nseems an irrelevant one. Why should we spend billions\nin solving only one tenth of the problem? To replace\nall of the world's coal fired power stations by 2025,\nallowing for a2% increase in consumption per year\nwould mean a new nuclear plant being built every 1-2\ndays. This would increase the number of reactors from\n398 to 8,000 at a cost of around $2 billion each. Even\nif this kind of expansion could happen, no geologically\nsafe technology exists to dispose of the waste we\nhave now, let alone that from 8,000 reactors.\nUranium too would eventually become a problem, but\nfor the opposite reason: there wouldn't be enough of\nit-like oil and coal it's a finite resource. To use less\nenergy may be a better solution.\nThe Government's own a div is ers have indicated\nthat energy consumption in the UK could be reduced\nby 40% (per capita) by 2025. Examples of ways in\nwhich we could save energy would be using new\ntechnology which makes new buildings 75% more\nefficient than before, a better, sub sidi sed public\ntransport service, setting efficiency standards for new\nelectrical appliances, and using longer lasting\nfluorescent light bulbs instead of incandescent ones.\nSchemes such as using methane gas from rubbish tips\nand coal gas fires( ie turning coal into methane before\ncombustion) could also reduce the amount of non-renewables used. These schemes could be introduced\nin a few months, instead of the six years minimum\nfor a new nuclear plant to be built. We don't have six\nyears to waste.\nThe true madness of expanding nuclear power in\nan effort to combat the greenhouse effect is realised\nwhen we consider the Third World countries. All of\nthe underdeveloped nations want their chance to\nenjoy the prosperity that we have had this century-we have no right to stop them. However for them to\ncompete in a nuclear powered world they would have\nto spend around $64 billion per year on power. This\nfigure is laughable when you consider that the Third\nWorld nations owe over $1000 billion now and have\nto pay $50 billion just in interest every year. It really\nis up to the developed countries to research cheap,\neffective, energy saving technology, so that the\nunderdeveloped nations have an alternative to the\nslippery slope of atmosphere polluting industrialisation\nthat we have pursued.\nAccording to the USA institute, an energy saving\nstrategy can be up to seven times more cost effective\nin reducing C02 than a nuclear strategy. Why then\ndoes the Government persist with its expansion\nideas?...A vision of the miners' strike springs to\nmind-wouldn't life at no 10 be much easier without\na lot of bol shy miners? Also, if you're as keen on\nnuclear weapons as Mrs Thatcher is, then a guaranteed supply of plutonium is necessary.\nTherefore by promoting nuclear power at the\nexpense of energy efficiency schemes, we are in very\nserious danger of the greenhouse effect continuing to\naccelerate. This could lead to devastating floods, food\nshortages, loss of drinking water supplies and wars,\nto name but a few. There are also most sinister\novertones such as an increased arms race, terrorists\nutilising readily available plutonium and accidents.\nTo quote Greenpeace 'There is no room in the\ngreenhouse for nuclear illusions'.\nClare Davis, Geology 3.\nPage 13\n\n"

    "content": "Football | Rugby\nIC 1sts3 Goldsmiths-1\nIC extended their lead at the top of the ULU Premier\nDivision, crushing second-placed Goldsmiths with a display of clinical finishing. IC had developed an\nalarming habit of playing atrocious football until they\nconceded a goal. So it was again with Goldsmithsall over for the first 15 minutes so deservedly taking\nthe lead with a sweetly struck half volley. This\nstunned the IC boys into action and they immediately\nbegan imposing themselves on the match. Femi\nOmotoya levelled the scores with a delightful finish\nfrom Adam Thomas through-ball and Pip Peel\nthumped home a defender-assisted goal from outside\nthe box to give IC the half-time lead.\nIC started the second half sluggishly but still looked\nthe sharper in front of the goal. Toni de Lyon secured\nthe points midway through the half when his\nspectacular overhead kick found its way through a packed area into the net. High drama followed soon\nafter though when Felix Francis, already cautioned in\nthe first half, was dismissed for a cynical foul-running\na full 35 yards to viciously chop down his man!\nReduced to 10 men, IC were forced to defend but Stu\nMiller marshalled the back men superbly and\nGoldsmiths were held to shooting from outside the\nbox. IC still had the audacity to attack and Pat\nFancock cracked in a30 yard er, only for it to be ruled\noffside.\nSurrey-1 IC 1sts1 IC dropped their first point of the season in a game\nthey really should have won, totally outclassing Surrey\nUniversity in the second half.\nOn a difficult pitch IC struggled early on to move\nthe ball around and Surrey had much of the early\nrunning. IC, though, had the better chances, Pat\nFancock dipping a shot just over the bar. An\nuncharacteristic mistake led to Surrey's goal-George\nHabib and Felix Francis collided allowing the Surrey\nnumber 9 to nip around Si Holden and score. From\nthen on the IC pressure was relentless, but it took an\nown goal by the Surrey keeper punching an in swinging Pat Fancock corner into his own net, to bring the\nscores level midway through the second half. IC\npressed forward for the winner and several chances\nwent desperately close, the best being when Pip Peel\nhit the post but Adam Thomas could only fire the\nrebound at the keeper.\nIC 1st XV-14 Surrey 1st XV-7\nIC expected this match to be one of the hardest in the\nUAU round. This was true and the team found\nthemselves coming away with a narrow but well\nearned win.\nAll match the Surrey team unsettled the stronger\nIC team by infringing around the scrum and line out, generally being a bit of a nuisance all round and IC\nwere not helped in this respect by a poor standard of\nrefereeing. IC always had the upper hand in every\ndepartment but almost certain balls were lost by\nstupid knock on s, mistakes or Surrey intrusions.\nWithout doubt, IC missed scrum half Simon Bicknell,\nout due to an ankle injury. Without him, IC could not\nclick together as a team. Stand-in Matt Tilbury coped\nIC 2nd XV-7 Surrey 2nd XV-10\nIC 2nds did not fair well in their encounter, going down\nnarrowly by just three points.\nIC, leading at half time with a try by nifty stand-off\nAndy Felmming and a penalty by Tintin, were assured\nof a clear win. The Surrey pack, heavier and more\nadept, took the initiative and soon press uri sed the IC\nline. Whereas IC were unable to match their\nopponents up front, after a valient defence, Surrey\npierced through to tighten the score.\nadmirably, playing very well, considering his lack of\nexperience and situation of being thrown in at the\ndeep end.\nAt half time the score was 3-6 in IC's favour, thanks\nto a pushover scrum scored by Alex Prince and Mike\nAnderson converting it.\nThe second half was rather a stalemate situation-IC keeping play tight, always in control, relying on\nstand off Mike Anderson to keep pegging Surrey back\nwith superb line kicking. Eventually the forwards got\ntheir reward with two well worked tries from Pete\nDrew and Alex Prince. As the final whistle blew, relief\nwas evident. After a hard battle IC deserved to be the\nvictors, ensuring the beer flowed and hymns were\nsung well into the night.\nWith continuing pressure Surrey scored their second\nand conclusive score, after slip-shod tackling let them\nthrough to score an easy try.\nWith only minutes remaining IC made one last\nassault which was met directly with sub born resistance and never looked like creating an opening.\nThe final whistle blew and fifteen dejected IC players\ntrudged back to their gloomy changing room.\nAfter a hard and dogged battle, resulting in two\nplayers being taken to hospital, IC now know that\nthings do not always go your own way.\nHockey IC 111-11 Surrey 1\n1\n1\n\u2014\n0\nIC lis\u20142 Surrey lis\u20140\nAlthough the better team, IC 2nds didn't manage to\nconvert their chances again and could only gain a20 margin of victory over their Surrey opposition.\nIC started on the offensive but didn't manage to\nbreak through as the pitch resembled a sandy beach\nrather than a plush green grass surface. It was nearing\nhalf-time when Steve Burton managed to get into the\nSurrey 'D' and hit the ball into the net to make the\nscore 1-0 to IC. Then, straight after the restart, IC\nattacked and gained a well earned short corner.\nDespite the other ones being squandered, the 'short ie' Page 16\nteam of Bob Anderson hitting out, Dave Millard\nstopping and Colin Wright striking, get it right and\nColin struck the ball home to leave the goal keeping in no man's land. The half-time whistle went, to leave\nsurrey shocked by the sudden surge of goals going\ninto the interval.\nSurrey started the second half trying their best\nwhich wasn't good enough for IC's standard.\nHowever, the pti ch got in the way of some good\nhockey and only Steve Burton staying offside could\ndeny Colin Wright his second goal of the afternoon,\nleaving the final score at 2-0 to IC.\nAfter winning last year's UAU game 3-1, IC Ill's expected a low scoring and difficult match against\nSurrey Ill's, and tor at least two minutes it was just\nthat with the score remaining evenly balanced at 0-0.\nThen IC made a vital breakthrough from a nicely\nworked move down the left wing involving numerous\nplayers to take the lead. A further ten 'vital\nbreakthroughs' followed; which the reporter can\nremember very little about except that they were all\nsuperbly executed against the run of play. The scorers\nwere however recorded for posterity: Jon Briggs (3),\nIan McGovern (3), Dom Howard (21, Adam Pritchard\n(2), Kevin Hill (1).\n\n"

    "content": "Michelle Consoc Quorum\nma belle Fox hunt caller\nDear Michelle,\nIn reply to your letter (Issue 848), concerning the\ndecision to ban Price-Waterhouse from the Careers\nFair, I should like to say the following.\nLike so many other people you are keen to condemn\nwithout finding out the facts. You criticise decisions\nwhich you denied yourself the opportunity to be party\nto. Above all else you damn the decision without\nproposing any alternatives.\nYour letter had about as much thought and\npreparation put into it as the motion that was\nproposed at the Extraordinary General Meeting. The\ndifference between the motion and the letter is that\nI used the motion in a sensible manner to achieve\nreasonable objectives at no cost to any student. Your\nletter quite blatantly undermines all student unions in\nall their activities over one small matter about which\nyou apparently know none of the facts.\nYou suggest in your letter than there are 'both\nsensible and stupid ways to fight' the loans scheme.\nOf your sensible methods I presume you advocate\nwriting to your MP, have you done this? Have you\npersuaded anyone else to do this? Or even questioning\nyour MP personally, do you know how to lobby your\nMP? Or peaceful demonstrations, or petitions. Open\nup your eyes, clear your ears, have you not seen or\noverheard the thousands of students already doing\nthese things? All to no avail because this government\nis blind and deaf to the students' requests as you\nappear to be.\nOne of the remaining ways open to try and stop the\nloans scheme going ahead is to persuade the persons\nresponsible for implementing the scheme that it will\nnot work. If the motion had been a personal attack\non Price-Waterhouse then it would surely have\nadvocated removing all Price-Waterhouse literature\nfrom the Careers Office. Did it? No. Do you really think\nthat removing Price-Waterhouse from one Careers Fair\nwill affect students' job prospects? You certainly have\na lot to learn in your next two and a half years here:\nif you can afford to stay here that long, that is!!\nThe banning of Price-Waterhouse is presently being\nused to:\n1. Promote awareness of the effects of the student\ntop-up loans scheme.\n2. Gain access to the financial institutions who will\nbe running the scheme so that we can put across our\nargument in a professional and educated manner.\nIn the light of your concern I am sure I will see you\nat future Union General Meetings or at least in my\noffice asking for information and contributing to the\ndecision being made.\nYours sincerely,\nN.B. McCluskey, ICU President 89/90\nPS. Chopping off your legs to evade the Poll Tax\nis not too good an idea. Disabled access in this College\nis absolutely appalling. Monasteries do not pay Poll\nTax though?\nLetters should be addressed to the editor. The\nletters column is a forum for general debate, not\nas lagging match between individuals. I have not\naltered this letter. In the future, letters written in\nthis style will be heavily edited. Ed\nDear Dave,\nI read in last week's FELIX that Miss Nicky Fox felt\ncompelled to resign from her post of Chairman of the\nICU Conservative Society, as she was opposed to:\n1. Government policy on student loans.\n2. The Community Charge.\n3. The charisma-cult of Mrs Thatcher.\nNone of the above factors have altered significantly\nsince Miss Fox was elected earlier this year. This\nmakes me wonder why she actually stood for the\nposition.\nMiss Fox informs me, that although the above\nreasons are true, the more significant reason for her\nresigning is of a personal nature. If this is true I cannot\nsee why Miss Fox did not inform FELIX that she was\nresigning for personal reasons. As a result of her\nactions surrounding her resignation she has wounded\nthe Society even further.\nIt is vital that the Conservative Society now elects\na Chairman who actually believes in Government\nPolicy (however unpopular) and has the ability to start\nto repair the damage that the Society has sustained.\nYours sincerely,\nMark Page, Mech Eng 3, Former Vice-Chairman\nof External 1988-1989 ICU Conservative Society\nFizzical\nreply\nDave,\nAs the 'enterprising student' referred to, I would like\nto inform the anonymous writer of the very inaccurate\nletter in last week's FELIX, of the facts.\nFirstly, Applied Biologists were not forbidden to do\nplacements overseas. When my placement in the\nGambia was being arranged, the outcome of the AUT\naction was not yet decided. The exams might still\nhave been set before the end of the Easter term-or\nthey may not have been set at all.\nBy the time I left in April the situation was still\nuncertain. I had a20kg baggage allowance to last for\na6 month stay-so I wasn't able to take 10kg of\nbooks to revise from in case the exams were\nscheduled for the summer.\nI returned just before the start of the autumn term\nand started the exams in the second week. Since the\nonly gap in my timetable is Wednesday afternoon*,\nI had to take the exams one at a time, at weekly\nintervals.\nThe implication that I received preferential\ntreatment as a result of 'flattering male lecturers' is\npetty and absurd.\nFelicity Marsh, Applied Biology IV\n*l hope this won't herald another torrent of abuse\nfor the Life Sciences Department.\nDear Dave,\nAn ICU General Meeting took place at 1pm today\n(Thursday). For most students, this constitutes news.\nThere were, to the best of my knowledge no posters\nadvertising the meeting, and there had been but a one\nline casual mention of the fact in last week's FELIX.\nAs a result, only some thirty odd people, mostly Union\nhacks, present.\nI called 'quorum'. Why?\nThe main purpose of the meeting was to conduct\nelections for a number of Union posts. There averaged\nabout one candidate per post, mainly because few\nknew about the availability of the posts, or saw the\nc and it ate proposal papers on the noticeboard on the\nwalls of the Union Office staircase. As a result, a handful of hacks would have elected candidates in a form of 'one candidate elections' that have been\nrejected by most communist states. All this from a Union that wishes to conduct business in the name\nof all of its students.\nIC Students' Union is a union of all the students.\nIf ICU makes a stance against loans, for increased pay\nfor lecturers or whatever, it must do so because that\nis what the students, the Union members, wish. At\nthe moment, Union hacks pass the policy and the\nstudents watch: sometimes in anger, sometimes in\nsupport, but almost always lacking sufficient strength\nof feeling to walk all the way to the JCR, sit down,\nlisten, and raise their Union cards at the relevant\nmoment.\nWhat the ordinary students of Imperial believe in is\napathy, and the Union policy should reflect that. In\nother words the Union should NOT indulge in any form\nof political or social campaign.\nThis is a sorry state of affairs. I would much rather\nsee 300 students at each and every (or even most)\nmeetings, listening to debates and passing motions\non strongly felt issues. I would call upon all students\nto make an effort to attend such meetings and I urge\nthe Union Exec to publicise the existence of, and\neducate its members on the merits of attending Union\nGeneral Meetings.\nUntil that happens, it is unacceptable that the Union\nshould pass motions on anything, or elect candidates\nfor any posts, as the students that the Union\nrepresents obviously don't care for or believe in such\nthings.\nTHAT is why I called quorum.\nThomas Wyatt, Maths II.\nPLEASE NOTE\nA number of letters have been received on the\nsubject of last week's 'Personal' letter.\nUnfortunately it was not possible to print a large number of them, since they did not carry\na name. FELIX will withhold names by request,\nat the editor's discretion, but we have to have\nthe name of the author of each letter. It is not\nsufficient to place the words 'Name withheld\nby request,' at the end of a letter. We will\nendeavour to print every letter received, but\nreserve the right to edit. Deadline for letters\nis 12.30pm Tuesday.\n21 Page\n\n"

    "content": "M31\u2014A family romance\nStephen Wright pp214 \u00a33.99 available from the IC Union Bookstore\nTo those of you who do not know (probably the\nmajority) M31 is not a motorway or even a trouser\nsize but the Anchromeda galaxy. With that in mind\nyou may well expect a fantastic al account of\nintergalactic war, warp drives and all, but fortunately\nyou would be very wrong. (All you science fiction\ntypes with your Iron Maiden t shirts; most of us got\npast the 'beam me up Scotty' stage about ten years\nago.)\nThe cover of a mid-western church gives a better,\nif somewhat vague, insight into the book's contents.\nThe setting is earthbound if the story itself is a little\npie in the sky. Perhaps the best clue to the weird and\noften confusing story within is the large blue radar dish\nperched on top of the church.\nDash and Dot are two all too typical American\ncranks who believe passionately that they are\ndescended from aliens from the aforementioned\ngalaxy. They travel the country spreading their\nmessage on talk shows and radio phone-ins.\nThey say that 'The Occupants', the name they use\nfor the aliens, are everywhere constantly hovering\nabove us feeding on electricity which they say is a form of highly concentrated information. If you are\nwondering why we never see them they are in blue\nspace ships that blend into the sky; something to think\nabout.\nReturning from a week of shows with their daughter\nZoe (who they believe is being use by 'The Occupants'\nas a method of communication) to their home in the\nchurch to find they have gained two guests.\nGwen and Beale are both fanatical about UFO's and\nfollow Dash and Dot around the country. Beale carries\nwith him a rucksack full of newspaper cuttings\nconcerning UFOs saying that 'sometimes words are\nmore important than food'.\nThe family is a complex contortion of personalities\nthat are in almost constant conflict. Ranging from the\nvicious and brutal Dallas who spends most of his day\nwith a can of Budweiser in his hand to Maryse who\nis quiet and gentle with her baby.\nAs a piece of creative writing the book is very good,\nin places brilliant, but not too verbose allowing the\nstory to develop through the book and the characters\nto reveal their true nature. Not only is the narrative\nwell done but some of the character comments show\nreal brilliance. Dallas at one stage describes the sky\nat night as 'Gods dandruff and Dash uses the\nsarcastic comment 'why is it every time I leave the\nhouse all the alcohol evaporates?'.\nThings do get slightly cluttered as I feel the number\nof characters used was excessive and the author\ncould have done well to leave a couple out completely.\nIn addition to this the book has a major problem;\nalthough not as bad as some books the plot can get\nquite confusing particularly at the end. For this reason\nyou do need to concentrate on every page for\neverything to remain clear.\nOverall I feel I can recommend the book as being\ngood with some excellent descriptive passages\nthroughout.\nStephen Wright has also written Meditations in\nGreen which won the Maxwell Perkins prize for best\nfirst novel 1985.\nIan Hodge.\nMotor Mania 89-Earls Court\nThe 1989 Motor Fair, held at Earl's Court recently is\nbest described as nine days of macho posturing by\ncar producers.\nWell, to some extent that's what it's all about and\nlet's face it, if your stand is host to several gruesome\nlooking pieces of red metal (Ferrari, Lamboughini) it's quite difficult not to be accused of posing.\nThis year saw the trend towards a green lifestyle\nand the family car. Most manufacturers took the\nchance to proclaim their latest environmentally\nfriendly machines. Most of the cars present have been\nable to run on unleaded petrol and the three-way\ncatalytic converter (the 'Cat) is also becoming\nincreasingly common and often a standard item.\nFrom the end of 1992 all new cars from Robin\nReliants to Ferraris will, by law, have to have a catalytic converted fitted to comply with tough new\nEC legislation on exhaust emissions.\nAll of the major European and Far Eastern\ncompanies were present with several notable British,\nas well as world, debuts. Lotus were showing the\nsensational new Elan. This 2-seater, open top\nsportscar was designed in conjunction with the\nJapanese company Isuzu, and is built using some\ncomponents manufactured by Isuzu in the Far East.\nOther new, but less exciting, models included a sleek new Vauxhall Coupe, the Calibra; the re styled Ford Fiesta XR2i-same as its predecessor but with\na new letter for fuel injection. Peugeot Talbot, another\ncompany with a penchant for lots of letters were\nshowing the latest 405 in its various forms including\na four-wheel-drive version.\nSome notable vehicles included the brand new\nPorsche 911 Camera and the BMW Z1 which is\nprobably best known for its doors which are operated\nby an electro-hydraulic mechanism, the doors and\nwindows slide into the sill of the car to produce a truly\n'open' sports car. I shudder to think what happens if\nthe fancy electrics decide to give up the ghost.\nOne or two companies failed to draw attention in\nquite the way they intended. Forinstance Citreonshowing the new but rather ugly XM-got more\nattention for their stand which was a huge revolving\ncontraption with a large upside down pyramid in its\ncentre. Was this, perhaps, Citreon's contribution to\nthe bi cent eni al celebration of the French Revolution?\nDAN\nPage 3\n\n"
