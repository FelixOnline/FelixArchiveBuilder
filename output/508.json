Bona fide fiancee s are entitled to enter without going through\nlengthy clearance procedures.

    "content": "Page 2\nDear Sir. - The last two editions of\nFELIX have both contained\nreferences to the use of Abortion,\nand both have been equally\nextreme, but opposite, in their\nviews. Last week's FELIX( No.\n3071\ncontained a letter supporting\nthe \"'Positive Alternatives To Abortion\"' cult. It began by\nstating that life begins at\nconception, and that any attempt\nat discussing this point is both\nirrational and impossible. Furthermore, that \"there tire no\nserious grounds for saying that life\nbegins after conception.''\nSince the entire PATA philosophy rests on this point, it is\nworthy of considerable thought.\nThe pre-natal development\nof a child can be seen as a continuum of events, during\nwhich modifications are done on a molecular scale to ab sic unit. For\ninstance, matter is accumulated\nto form the egg. which is modified\non release, further modified at\nconception, and subsequently\nmodified a very large number of\ntimes before it's even ready to be\nborn. let alone afterwards.\nLooking at it in this \"discrete'\"\nway (I hope you will forgive my\nmodel shows that the PATA have chosen one such modification as their origin, and yet it is\nno more dramatic a modification\nthan any of the others.\nWhat about all the partially\ncompleted humans that are lost so\nregularly because we haven't allowed them to have just that\nmodification or any of the\nsubsequent ones? That is as much \"compulsory euthanasia'' as\nabortion is.\nSurely there are grounds for\nproposing that life begins after\nconception? In particular, perhaps the largest step in the\ndevelopment is when the child\nceases to be a subsidiary of its\nmother's circulatory system and\nbegins to function as a living\nhuman being by breathing.\nBefore this takes place the\nfoetus still has to be given a final modification before it\ncan become a living child.\nAfter this has occurred the child\nis no longer dependent on the\nmother who created it - her place\ncould be taken by anyone, be they\nnurse, father, etc ' but a different personality may. of\ncourse, result).\nI would agree that the use of\nabortion to reduce the number of\nhandicapped children is bad. the\nreason being that handicapped\npeople can enjoy life as much as\nothers (and no doubt they have a better appreciation of life than\nmost of us).\nHowever, it is surely not evil\nto use abortion for the\ntermination of unwanted pregnancies in circumstances\nwhere the child could not be\nsatisfactorily supported. For\ninstance, a child with one parent,\nwho spends his most forming\nyears in a university nursery, and\nnot with his mother, is not going\nto know his mot Iter anything like\nas much as a child developing at\nhome. If the parents have\nprepared themselves sufficiently it\nshould not be necessary for a mother to take a full-time job, and\npreferably not even a part-time\njob. while caring for her child.\nSurely if children are going to be\nbrought tip by a method of mass-production, nursery style, it is\nbetter to delay birth until such\ntime as parents can do their best\nat an exceedingly difficult job.\nI am not criticizing the\nperformance of individual nurseries. I am suggesting that the\nlarge-scale use of them falls far\nshort of proper motherly care and\nattention.\nOn the other hand, Michael Arthur's Universal First Aid Kit provided the week before ( FELIX Xo.506) is not very commend a ble, either. Apart from its lack of\ndiscretion, the ad vocation of\nabortion in terms so shallow\ndemonstrates a frightening level\nof insensitivity, particularly coming from a Welfare Officer.\n\"Don't worry, there's always\nabortion\" (not his words) is a despicable attitude to take\ntowards the realities of life.\nMichael provides an excellent\nservice for the students at IC, but I think he has slipped up here.\nThe two extreme attitudes to\nabortion in the last two editions\nmust surely have drastically oversimplified the situation. Abortion\ncan be used to prevent a childhood spent in misery and\nalienation. It should surely not be\nused as an easy solution to a problem which in so many cases\nwould never have occurred, had a little though been applied to the\nsituation.\nYours faithfully,\nAndrew White\nElec. Eng.\nDear Sir,\nI would like to congratulate\nthe organisers of Welfare Day on\ntheir 'obvious success' and I hope\nit becomes an annual event.\nHowever, it would seem my\nenthusiasm for such an event is\nnot shared by all, especially\nMr. Lane (Letters, FELIX No507;.I feel Mr. Lane has blown\ncertain aspects of the day out of all\nproportion. The Condom Inflating contest was probably\nnever meant to be anything other\nthan 'really silly', to quote Mary, and provided light relief on an\notherwise serious afternoon.\nPersonally, I do not feel\nhumiliated by my association\nwith a Union promoting such an\nevent, indeed I am proud to\nbelong to a Union with a balanced outlook on the problems\nof young people _\nSome of these problems are\nof prime importance here.\nDespite the fact that it appears to\ncontravene Mr. Lane's moral\ncode, sex is enjoyed by many\nstudents at College. It is therefore\nquite reasonable to provide\ninformation on contraception and\nan honest account in FELIX is an\nexcellent way of doing . this.\nDiscretion in an article such as\nthis would be misplaced, as few\npeople would want to unravel\ncryptic clues in order to avoid an\nunwanted pregnancy. I also feel it\nis useful to discuss these matters\nopenly on occasions such as\nWelfare Day rather than telling\npeople they should feel guilty\nabout the whole affair.\nMany people get a great deal\nol pleasure out of sex as an\nintegral part of a loving relationship (I do not consider\n'love' to be a tainted word). Manypeople also enjoy sex on a purely\nphysical basis, and can afford to if\nthey have the common sense to\nemploy our modern understanding of contraception. Why should people feel guilty about\nthe physical pleasure of sex when\nthey would not feel guilty about\nthe physical pleasure given by\neating food or drinking good\nbeer?\nI would never dispute\nanyone's right to religious views\nbut I would be grateful if such\nviews were kept to the individual\nand not used to judge others.\nYours, depraved, .\nNick Morton, Biochem. P.G. Sir, - A couple of points\nraised in last weeks FELIX cannot , surely, go unanswered.\nGodsquad ( ICC U, Chaplaincy,\nMethsoc, etc.) seem to have\nbecome too complacent of late so\nto kickoff, I for one disagree with\nthe statement made on the letters\npage last week that; \"Total\na bsl in ance is a100% effective method\nof contraception\" - surely Godsquad\nhave heard of Virgin birth - the\nBritish legal system certainly has,\nand recognised at least one case of\nit earlier this century. Perhaps gs do not believe in such religious\nnonsense?\nTo go on and suggest that\ntotal a bst in ance is anything other\nthan extreme is absurd. Tryl oo king up extreme in a dictionary. It could be argued\nthat castration is more extreme,\nbut surely that is merely a method\nemployed to attain a bst in ance, and cannot therefore be more\nextreme than the end which it\nattains. Further suggesting that\n\"there are no side effects\" is to talk on\nrather thin ice. Does the author of\nlast weeks letter have curly hair or\nwear glasses? Mr. Rider then\nproceeds to jump up and down on\nthe ice by implying that sex causes\nguilt. It remains true that many-people have lost a lot of sleep over\nsex (perhaps not at IC?) but I cannot help thinking that he has\nmissed the point. A strong sex-guilt association is possibly a minor psychiatric problem caused by prolonged a bst in ance, thus invalidating the \" no side\neffects\" claim. Further, I for one,\nwould feel guilty if indulging in\ntotal a bst in ance, at the thought of\nmany girls being deprived of 24-hour access to my body, which\nbrings me on to a number of\npoints raised by Mary( Attenborough)'s letter last week.\nMost people at IC realise\nthat they are wanted for their\nminds- by the academic staff if noone else, and occasionally, by-some sections of Life Sciences. To realise that they may also be\nwanted for their bodies is surely-reassuring if in moderation-which is not quite what Marysaid.\nIncidentally, if Mr. Lucock\nwere to hang around Bolton\nGardens late at night, he might\nwell find himself being treated\npurely as a sex object. Finally,\nwhilst on the subject of the\nLiberals, did Mary really mean\nwhat she said - and I quote (in\ncontext, too):' 'Male only\nevents....are aimed at re-emphasising a man's sex role (having a bit of fun with\nthe lads)\"? I thought that the\nYMCA catered for that sort of\nthing.\nYours sincerely,\nK.J. Fenning\nDear Sir, - I feel I must reply to\nMs. Attenborough's letter of\n2/2/79. I am, once again,\nappalled at the de tre ment she\ncauses to women fighting against\nsexism by the ill advised words she\nuses, .\nThe dictionary definition of\n\" SEXISM\" is\"any sort of\ndiscrimination on grounds of sex (orig.\nagainst women, now against women\nand men)\" - chamber's20 th century dictionary - and I wonder\nwhy she hasn't thought that\npositive discrimination might\ninclude encouraging men to\nbecome nurses and secretaries etc.\nI am constantly amazed by\nthe strain fellow women put on\ntheir husbands, brothers etc. by-expecting them to be a \"tower of\nstrength\" to turn to when the\ngoing gets tough and use their sex\nas an excuse for being weak and\nineffectual. I feel there is much to\nbe gained for both sexes by-removing sexism - women will lee l respected as being of some\nintellectual as well as physical\nworth and men will not feel it\nnecessary to act out a role of\naggression, unsuited to most men\nI know.\nFinally, I must comment on\nMs. Attenborough's apparent\ncondemnation of marriage. Does\nshe seriously believe that a woman is either a quiet,\nsubmissive and domesticated\ncontinued on Page 6\n\n"

With the help of\nexcellent slides, he described the intricate detective work to solve the\ndifficult question of what the past climate is like. He justified the use of\npollen as an indicator, since a particular type of plant only flourishes\nunder certain conditions. Hundreds of holes were drilled all over Britain,\nand the number of pollen s in the sample was literally counted under a microscope. After much work, a picture of past climate in Britain\nemerged. He stressed that there were still unsolved problems\nintroduced by human activites.\nThe lecture was well attended, a lively discussion carried on afterward\nover coffee and biscuits.\nThe next :ec ture is on 12th Feb, given by Professor W.T. Welford of\nPhysics Department on \"the Use of Space Age Optics to Capture Solar\nEnergy\" . It starts at 5.30 pm in Lecture theatre Room 719 In the New\nHuxley Building.\nA summary of this term's program is as follows:\n19th Feb.

Since this shareholding was\nbought with what is, effectively, your money, you (that is, every\nI.C. student) are entitled to know what is going on in the\nCompany.\nWell, lor a start there has been a new manager appointed recently.\nRoger Trask, will actually take up his post at the beginning of March, his predecessor, Mr. Thomas, continuing up till then. Mr. Thomas has\ndone a very good job as manager, setting the Company on its feet and\nmaking it run at a small profit. Unfortunately he felt he was operating\nin a bit of a vacuum since most of the student directors really did not\nhave either the time or the technical expertise to really help him run the\nCompany. To attempt to alleviate this problem the Company is setting\nup a Management Committee, Hopefully this will have someone with\nexperience of the Travel Industry, outside our Company sitting on it. If\nyou happen to know a Director of Thomas Cook's, or some other Travel\nfirm, whom you think may be interested in assisting us, by sitting on this\nCommittee, then please let me know.\nThe Company has three retail Manchester, Salford, Leicester,\noutlets, one at 117, Euston Road,\none at Coldsmith's College and\none here. Yes here at IC in the\nUnion Lower Lounge,somewhere between the pinball\nmachines and the pool-table to be\nprecise and it is open between\n11.00 a.m. and 2.00 p.m. on\nMondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays\nand Fridays.\nSo what is there for you? Well,\nif you live in Birmingham,\nLeeds, Sheffield, Nottingham or\nBradford I'm sure you will be\ninterested in the weekend return\ncoach trips for up to 4 pounds.\nThere are also free trips to the\nUSA with BUN AC, and cut-price\nair-flights to most popular holiday countries.

As a present to get our people involved with the toys of\nthis enemy, and to buy more of these toys because\nthere was nothing left of the content of their\nculture, which they had been made to forget. They\nhad been made frightened of it and the people who\ntried to get back the content to the container had\nbeen imprisoned (e. g.Dr. Shariaty).\nBut who cares? The young generation in\nEngland and America is too busy following the\npop-stars wherever they go. It is too busy helping\npeople with their problems through Scientology\nthan to help them to communicate better. Instead\nof using their ability for constructive purposes to\nsave a person's life, they prefer to use it for personal\nand selfish means.\nLet alone the more mature generation such as\nthe Owens who are \"honest1' men and who are just\ndoing their jobs to save the long sleeping young\ngeneration of England from a big crisis which\nwould endanger them with a shortage of oil or a reduction in the sales of do-it-yourself bits and\npieces.\nFortunately the CIA was asleep in that\nearly morning when our people woke up and lit\ntheir candles to search for the content of their\nreligion.

The consequences?.... martial law. Black Friday.\nBut we are not frightened of tanks and guns. We are lovers and love is something abstract and this\nlove give us enough willpower to carry on fighting,\nignoring the guns and tanks.

Because of the insults and rid i cle of\nyour fellow students at I.C. unable to come to\nterms with a part of themselves which they\nare afraid to admit exists.\nI have realised that being gay is often\nassociated with being promiscuous and that\nthis promiscuity is thought to be impersonal,\nselfish and unemotional. In my opinion and\nexperience this is a blatant fantasy spread\nabout to discredit gay relationships. Some\ngays, but by no means all, have more than\none emotional and sexual relationship, which I believe is good provided the people involved\ngrow from the relationships. Surely what we\nshould be fighting is not promiscuity or\nhomosexuality but LUST or equivalently\nS fiX IS Mi.e. treating people purely as sex\nobjects not human beings: such relationships\nare impersonal, selfish and unemotional and\ncan occur in monogamous and/ or heterosexual equally well as in promiscuous\nand/or homosexual relationships.\nI would be very happy to discuss with\nanyone or any group any relevant matters.\nFor the many gay students at IC reading this,\nplease seriously consider joining IC GAY SOC( contact me in room533, Huxley\nBuilding or phone int. tel. 4297) or\nalternatively come along to aU.L.

Election to the post is by a paper ballot\nMonday26 th Feb. in each department.\nRecently a job description was drawn up so to give each candidate an\nidea of what the post entails. This is printed in full below. In addition to\nreading this, it is an extremely good idea to speak to the present holder\nof the post. Following this, if you wish to have any more points answered\ne ome up to the Union Office any lunchtime and see me. Alter all, I have probably had more conversations with Dep reps this year than any\none else.\n1. A departmental representative primarily exists to represent the views\nof the student members of the department.\n2. To ensure democratic elections of Academic and Social Reps,\nfollowing AAC recommendation, for each year in the Department and\nto liaise .vith Postgraduate Affairs Officer over election of postgraduate\ndepartmental rep.\n3. To take an interest in all areas of concern to students in the\ndepartment, most particularly those concerning the academic, social\nand tutoring arrangements for that department and to co-ordinate the\nwriting; of the department's Alternative Prospectus entry.\n4. To co-ordinate the academic and social representatives holding\nregular open meetings, publicised whenever possible, with both groups\nin order to better understand the academic problems and social needs of\nthe department.\n5. To organise the student side of'the staff student committee. To ensure\nthat all problems relevant to that committee are discussed thereon. To\ntake matters not necessarily the concern of the staff student committee\nup directly with whatever other person or body may be concerned. To\nmake certain minutes are posted within the department and one SSC is\nheld a term.\n6. To attempt to ensure proper study facilities and social facilities in the\ndepartment.\n7. To attempt to stimulate interest in the department in all academic\nand social matters and questions of a wider educational matter.\n8. To sit on ICU Council, taking an interest in all areas of concern to the\nUnion and students at Imperial and may, as a Council member, sit on\nvarious committees to represent ICU.9. To communicate campaigns, policies and elections of ICU and the\nrespective C CU to departmental members.\n10. To sit on the Academic Affairs committees of ICU and their C CU. To sit on General committees of their respective C CU. To sit on Engineering Board if representing a Guilds department.\nShould attend Union General meetings.\n11. To take an active part in the introduction of students to I.C. and\ntheir department.\n12. To take an active part in the interviewing system of prospective\nstudents.\nThe job is very time consuming, particularly in the first term. It\nfurthermore needs a lot of dedication and personal effort. If you stand\nfor the job make sure you firstly know what the job entails, and secondly\nthat you have enough interest to carry it all out. It is an open-ended\ntask, a job of infinite scope, which brings little reward.\nFor the students within a department a bad departmental\nrepresentative leads to a demise of staff-student relations,\nrepresentation at a higher Union level, and participation in social\nevents.\nCarried out to the best of one's ability it does lead to a lot of personal\nsatisfaction. Sitting on all the committees also gives you a good insight\ninto the nature of the Union. So this is the job for any current first years\nwanting to actively participate in the running ol the Union.

Dear Sir,\nAfter having passively observed the exchange of\ncorrespondence about the latest\nedition of ' FORWARD', I wish,\nas a member of I.C. Liberal Club and an ex-of lice r ol I.C. Radio to\npoint out a few facts which I feel\nspeak for themselves.\n1) Last term I received\nfrequent circulars from I.C. Liberal Club committee\nmembers about numerous events\nand meetings throughout the\nterm.\n2) One of these events was an\neditorial meeting ol ' FORWARD' which 1 attended.\n3) As a result of that meeting.\nI wrote the front page article for\nthe edition of ' FORWARD' produced in the second half of last\nterm.\n4) I received no communication from Liberal Club that a further edition of ' FORWARD' was planned or to inform me of\nany meeting at which the\ncriticisms contained in it could\nhave been discussed.\n5) Unlike other editions, I have not vet received a copy of\n' FORWARD' through the\ninternal mail.\n6) I have not yet received any\ncommunication from I.C. Liberal\nClub this term.\nR. Bradley, CCD1.\nDear Sir,\nI am writing with reference\nto the article 'Jobs in South\nAfrica?' , which appeared in last\nweek' FT LIX. I would like to\ncorrect some of the statements\nmade in this article (with\nreference to the letter sent by the\nAcademic Affairs Committee):\n1) The chances of 'anyone\naccepting work in South Africa ...\nstrengthening the apartheid system' are\npretty remote, chiefly due to the\nfact that British citizens are not\ninitially entitled to vote until they\nchoose to become South African\ncitizens (obviously), so at this\nstage they would have absolutely\nno effect on the apartheid system.\nFurthermore, as apartheid is an\nAfrikaner-instigated system, the\npresence of English speaking\nwhites would lend to weaken\nrather than strengthen this\nsystem. (Afrikaners - descendants\nof the 1820 Dutch Settlers.)\n2) Only South African\ncitizens are legally hound in any\nway to serve in the army - I lived\nin South Africa for 11 years as a British subject and never got as far\nas touching an army uniform.\nIf the statement 'IC I'n ion policy calls for an immediate end to\nrecruiting in College for jobs in South\nAfrica' is followed through,\nemployment for graduates from\nthe Royal School of Mines will\nbe unnecessarily more difficult.\nAfter all, wc are all supposed\nto be intelligent university\nstudents, and thus should be able\nto decide lor ourselves where wc\nwould like to work. Of course, a bit of constructive criticism\nalways helps, but facts should\nnever be confused with media-generated opinions, as has\nhappened here.\nYours sincerely,\nStu Thomson, Pet. Eng.2 Dear Sir,\nI was disgusted with the\narticle on the British Army and\nIreland in F'ELIX last week. The\nmain aim of it seems to have been\nto propagate the blatant lie that\nNorthern Ireland is being forced\nto remain in the UK against the\nwill of its people. In fact, the\npeople of Northern Ireland have\nrepeatedly made it clear, in every\ngeneral election and referendum\nsince 1918, that the overwhelming majority wish to stay\nwithin the UK. The anonymous author (why\nanonymous?) says 'the British\nGovernment... partitioned Ireland' but conveniently (and\ndishonestly) ignores the fact that\nthe Bill as originally introduced\nintended to give independance to\nthe whole of Ireland. Separation\nfollowed only because of intense\npressure form the people of Ulster\nwho did not want to be part of an\nindependant Ireland. In spite of\nthis, the article claims 'fifteen\nthousand troops continue to hold\nthis artificially formed country for\nBritain' as if its people were\ndesperate to join the Republic.\nThe author then spends some\ntime criticising the emergency\npowers in use. Certainly, I don't think they are desirable, and I don't know of any MP that thinks\nthem desirable - it is the thugs of\nthe I.R.A. who have made them\nnecessary. Obviously the author\nhas not had his sister beaten up for\nchatting to a soldier, or his father\nmurdered for no greater crime\nthan being a Protestant. There\nhave been occasional abuses,\nagreed, but I challenge the author\nto name half-a dozen other\ncountries in the world where the\ngovernment and army have gone\nso far out of their way to be fair to\nterrorists.\nI would like to quote Adam Hall: 'the political terrorist is the\nperson who could create a new\nand better world, if he could\nexpress his dreams with intelligence, but having none, he\ncan only express his frustrations'.\nI rather think the same could\nbe said for our anonymous\nauthor.\nStephen Pole y.

FREE return flight, FREE board, pocket money, visa, and\ntwo weeks free time. We invite you to join us for a short film on\ncamp counselling in the USA and a talk from a camp director and\nCAMP AMERICA staff.\nTuesday, 20th February\n6.30 p.m. The Auditorium, Richmond College.( Kensington Campus)1 St Albans Grove, London W8( Gloucester Rd Underground) Write now or call for information to\nCAMP AMERICA, 37 Queens Gate, London SW7\nTelephone 01 - 589 3223\nTAT If\\ We li are Article Landlords and slot meters\nOne of the best known dodges used by landlords to part you from a higher proportion of your grant than they otherwise might do is to fiddle\nthe calibration on your electricity meter so you get less electricity than\nyou should for your money.\nFortunately there are provisions to counter this dastardly behaviour,\nalthough an attempt to use them to your advantage might conceivably\nprovoke a breakdown in your, hitherto, undoubtedly friendly relations\nwith your landlord!\nThe position would appear to be as follows: The most that a landlord\ncan charge you on resale of electricity is 3.2 pence per unit plus an\navailability charge (like a standing charge) of 3.3 pence per day which\ncan't be levied through the meter (unless you are given a periodic\nstatement capable of making any necessary adjustment).\nOne unit of electricity is equivalent to one Kilowatt hour so you can\nwork out whether your meter is registering the correct number of units\nfrom the ratings on any appliances that you use and then work out\nwhether you are being overcharged.\nIf your check shows that you are being overcharged, you should\napproach your landlord in the first instance. If he is not prepared to do\nanything about it, you can apply to the County Court under s29 of the\nElectricity Act 1957 for an order requiring your landlord to repay any\nexcess. It would probably be a good idea to get an electricians report on\nthe behaviour of your meter before going to court.\nSquatting\nDespite the fuss kicked up by the Campaign Against The Criminal\nTresspass Law, squatting is no less of a viable proposition than it was\nbefore the 1977 Criminal Law Act, although a degree more caution is\nrequired in certain respects than used to be the case.\nIf you are despairing of the possibility of ever being decently housed\nat a rent that you can afford, this is something that you might like to bear\nin mind as a realistic alternative to your present arrangements. It is not\nreally a question of usurping other peoples property rights, since there\nis nothing to stop them taking advantage of the appropriate legal\nmachinery if they feel so inclined. It is simply a means of using\nabandoned property which would otherwise remain empty and be of no\nuse to anyone.\nDuring Welfare Day, Piers Corbyn (ex - president of I.C.U., now\nworking with Squatters Union), started a list of people who would be\nElks Epistle (4)\nThere'll be no references to sex of any description or form in this\nweek's Epistle Honest.\nRight, now that's over onto the exciting stuff.\nDep Rep Elections\nWell the papers for these posts have been up since Monday and I'm just going to urge you to stand if you think you can and want to do the\njob. Remember it's a very important post. If you're in Management\nScience, particularly think about standing as there hasn't been one\nbefore and as most students are on a one year M. Sc. course, candidates\nmay be a bit thin on the ground.\nSabbatical papers go up on Monday 19th February\nSport Insurance\nNot many people seem to be aware that college has an insurance\npolicy that covers all students against personal injury if they are playing\nsport for a college team - i.e. medical expenses and compensation if you\nare deh abi lita ted except if your teeth are damaged. So if you break a leg, or similar, during a college sporting activity (this includes\nMountaineering, Karate and other 'dangerous' sports) you can claim\ncompensation.\nU GM Don't forget it on Tuesday 13th February at 1 pm in the Great\nHall .

Even if you became\ndeaf tomorrow, you would retain the whole\nknowledge, experience and vocabulary\nwhich are part of a personality built up by\nhearing. A deaf child starts with nothing but\nhis eyes, he has to learn that soundless\nshapes on faces have a meaning. He cannot\nask the questions that free his normally\ncurious mind. However most children are not\ntotally deaf and with understanding, hard\nwork and the latest technical aids, they can\nachieve oral is m and happily integrated with\nthe hearing world.\n11 year old Jerome Canvin is such a child.\nHe attends a normal primary school with a unit for children with defective hearing\nattached. Along with the other 12 children, at\nschool he can use a new piece of equipment\nknown as the 'Phonic Ear', which uses a radio-link, capable of communication with\nthe teacher for up to half a mile, and cutting\nout much of the background noise which\nmakes listening in a classroom very difficult\nwith normal aids. But as it costs 800 pounds\nonly four of them have this equipment at\nhome, so at 3 30 every day they must leave\ntheir 'bionic ears' (as they call them) behind\nand return to a silent world.\nRCS are to hold a special collection to buy\nJerome the aid, which \"would be an\nincredible advantage to him at a time when he\nreally needs one, and enable him to do a lot he\ncannot at the moment, including help him to\ntalk properly which is still a problem although\nhe is 11\" - in the words of his brother Mark, a student in Life Sciences. It will be done\nthrough the Devon branch of the National\nDeaf Children's Society, the Secretary of\nwhich said \"We would be delighted to accept\na cheque on Jerome's behalf ... it is a wonderful piece of equipment which is\nopening up a new world to the severely deaf.\"\nThe collection is to be held on Saturday17 th Feb and will be organised on a Year\nCollections' basis, as Jerome's parents have\ndonated a barrel (for the winning year) and\nprizes for the top three collectors, so do come\nout and support your year.

Many actually find work in\nthe West-End catering trade but the wages\nare so notoriously low that they have no\nchance of accumulating the deposit to enter\ninto the accommodation market. These\npeople therefore end up in hostels which are\nessentially nothing but beds for the night and\nin no way could be considered home, so\nduring the day they end up wandering the\nstreets. These are the people that New\nHorizon was established to help and the\nnumber of individuals that they saw last year\nexceeded 1000 with many making more than\none attendance.\nNew Horizon forms a kind of base for\nthese young people in that it offers a store for\ntheir few possessions or somewhere to get a shave and a wash. It also offers help in legal\nmatters, social security and many other\nthings including basic literacy.\nThe Centre maintains a workshop that they\nuse to give some very minimal training but as\na certain degree of literacy is required to gain\nadmittance to a government training scheme\nthis is what they concentrate on.\nOn Sundays they use two or three\nvolunteers, r mainly from other university\ncolleges who work with the visitors in an\ninformal way aiming to bring out their artistic\nand creative abilities using the many facilities\navailable.\nAnyway, if you are interested in the work of\nNew Horizon or any of the other similar\norganizations in London then please get in\ntouch.\nCheers, John Whitehouse\nChem PG.

This was IC first competitive game this season owing to\nthe combination of rain, snow, frost and Arthur which had so\nfar prevented play. Concern was expressed by some players\nabout their ability to survive the run out to the pitch and pre-match warm up without suffering from cramp, pulled\nmuscles, or other more serious ailments.\nIC were under pressure throughout most of the first half and failed\nto string more than one or two passes together. The college team were\nrelying on breakaway s to make use of the speed of Brindle, Rick ard and\nStephenson up front, and they were unlucky not to score when both\nRutty and Paver went close with headers. However, LSE' s pressure\neventually told and they scored after a quickly taken free-kick on the\nleft. In the second half, the iC team played with more authority\nalthough they still did not show the t brm of last term. After about\ntwenty minutes, IC equalise d through Brindle, who ran on to a Rickard\npass before easily beating the keeper. After this, IC could (should?) have\nscored three or four more goals but with a cold bottom four inches this\nproved beyond them, and the game finished a11 draw.\nTeam: Tsoukkas, Rutty, Reeve, Paver, Kendrick, Haralampous, Johnson,\nDavies, Rickard, Brindle, Stevenson.\n' Am mers miff 'Acker.\nIC 1st XI 3 VI R.F. H.3 FEB. This game saw IC gain\nanother two league points,\nthough like their last game against\nLSE the team again did not play\nwell.\nThe game was very scrappy\nthroughout, IC took the lead in the first half through Graham Rickard but failed to assert their\nauthority on the game. Regular\ngoalkeeper Tony Tso uk k as arrived late during the first-half\nhis place having already been ably\ntaken by Steve Veats. The real\nreason for Tsoukkas' interest in\nthe game was however discovered\nlater when he decided that in spite\nof his inactivity he still needed a shower and the chance to cavort\nwith centre-back Reeve. The\nsecond-half was much like the\nfirst and IC went 2-0 up when the\nball hit the end of Peter Rutty's boot before finding the back of the\nnet. RF H pulled a goal back but IC\nwent close with shots by Johnson\nand Nicholls before increasing\ntheir lead through Phil Brindle. So\na fairly comfortable 3-1 win, but\nthis poor performance will\nhopefully encourage more players to attend training on\nTuesdays and Thursdays.\nTeam: Veats, Rutty, Beer, Reeve,\nPrice, Nicholls, Johnson,\nHaralampous, Lenczner, Brindle,\nRickard. (Tsoukkas).\n'Ammersmiff 'Acker\nHALL FOOTBALL Last Sunday, Falmouth hall\nbeat Keogh by 8-2. The match,\nplayed at Harlington, was full of\nentertaining football. Harry Sing\nscored a sensational hat trick. He scored his last goal by picking the\nball up in defence and ran all the\nway down the wing, cut inside,\nswerved passed the Keo gh defence and after a quick one-two\nat the edge of the box slammed\nthe ball past the goalkeeper.\nThis result takes Falmouth\nhall to the top of the league with 4\npts from 4 games.\nHyde Park Relay\nI. C.C.C. are pleased to announce the\nrunning of the annual Hyde Park Relay on\nFebruary 24th at 3:00 pm.\nThis is the premier British College Relay\nRace, and to ensure its smooth running the\nC.C.C. would like to hear from any member\nof IC who would be willing to act as a course marker or help in any other way.\nHelpers should see any of the cross\ncountry club, or see myself,Keith Marshall,\nin the Union Office.\nSeconds beat LSE !\nL. S.E.2nd XI1I C2 nd XI2(3 rd instalment of IC 2nd's cup run)\nThis was the much awaited,\nweather delayed replay of the\nUL U reserves cup quarter final.\nAll IC players were safely tucked\nup in bed with cups of Horlicks by\n9.30pm the previous night on\nstrict instructions from Clive\nWhiteside. IC's hopes were\nbrightened by the prospect that\nI C1st XI were playing LSE1 st XI at the same time and so no new\n'stars' would spring up from\nnowhere.\nIC began the first half defending as usual and our\nattacks consisting of kicking the\nball into LSE' s half and hoping\nthis pressure would cause\nun forced errors. LSE opened the\nscore sheet, their player collecting\nthe ball near the halfway line and\nwith IC players trying their best\nto avoid him he proceeded to\npower the ball under a diving Al Betts. Despite this setback IC continued to fight on and Barnet,\nHatton and Price kept the LSE forwards under control with the\nusual 'pleasant' encouraging\nshouts from Chris Beer. However\nIC's attacking policies were not\nworking, which could be due to\nPhil Niccolls having argued with\nhis girlfriend, and LSE hung on to\ntheir lead up to half time.\nAfter the usual aggressive talk\n(pure aggression, no actual\nfootball tactics) at half time, IC started to play more constructively with Phil Niccolls chopping\ndown LSE' s centre-forward and\nNeil Price holding onto the little\nWelsh winger's shirt for a 'friendly' five seconds. IC's first\nproper attack of the game was\nstarted by Alistair Lencener\nshooting down the right wing and\nproducing a perfect cross for Dave\nHiggs to convert into a goal. This\ntriggered off IC's best play with\nsome good moves being developed by Adrian Clarke and\nPaul Barnet working together on\nthe right flank. 5 minutes later,\nJohn Demnitz decided to justify\nhis selection by collecting the ball\non the edge of the penalty area,\nbeating two defenders and the\ngoalkeeper to score what the\nreferee de sci bed as 'the best go af he'd seen for a long time (he\nobviously hadn't refereed for a long time).\nIC now had most of the play\nbut could create no more scoring\nchances and LSE were ruthlessly\nrobbed of the ball by the staunch\nback four and 'impossible' Phil\nNiccolls, whenever they ventured\nnear our penalty area.\nThe team were allowed a quick\ncelebratory orange slice before\nbeing taken home and tucked up\nin bed with more Horlicks by\nClive Whiteside in preparation\nfor Saturday, 10th February\nwhen they play QM C IPs in the\ncup semi-final match of the year.\n'Even more acer than ace\nsports writer Liam Gartside',\nPrince Le1 GLIDING CLUB\nANNUAL DINNER\nFriday 23rd February\nat 'The Telegraph',\nTelegraph Road,\nPutney Heath SW15.\nTickets from Susan Bush\n(Zoo II letter-rack) or Pete\nReading (Aero II letter-rack)\n\n"

    "content": "Issue No. 508 Friday, 9th February, 1979\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION FEES CAMPAIGN\nIC Union is to stage its biggest campaign for a considerable\nnumber of years in a bid to persuade the College not to impose\nany tuition fee increases next October and to bring overseas\nstudents' fees down to the home rate.\nTuition fees are expected to go up by about 10 per cent this\nyear following an announcement by Education Minister\nShirley Williams that fee-levels would keep pace with inflation.\nIt is estimated that the cost to the College of implementing the\nUnion demands would be in excess of \u00a3400,000.\nAt a meeting on Tuesday this week the Union External Affairs\nCommittee decided to direct the campaign at three main fronts: the\nmedia and public; the College and Governors; and the students\nthemselves.\nTo gain attention from the national media students are being asked\nto participate in a lobby of parliament involving a different MP each\nday for a month.\nStudents would first write to their MPs and arrange to see them at the\nHouse of Commons between 26th February and 23rd March. Dates\nwill be coordinated by the IC Union Office and students will only have\nto go to the office and inform the Union of their home address. The\nUnion would then prepare a letter to the student's MP, which the\nstudent would simply have to sign and post.\nbe a mass lobby of Governing\nAnother gimmick to attract\nmedia attention will be a \"speak-in\" at Speakers' Corner on\nSunday 25th February. As many\nstudents as possible will speak for\n5 to 10 minutes each including\noverseas students speaking in\ntheir own languages.\nStudents will also be\nencouraged to write letters and\narticles to the provincial press in\nfavour of overseas students being\nable to study in this country.\nIn addition the Union will\ncontact former overseas students\nnow working in their own\ncountries, and ask them to write\nto the Rector telling him how\nmuch they have benefitted from\nbeing educated at IC. Copies of\nthese letters will be sent to the\npress.\nGOVERNING BODY These tactics are aimed at\ngaining public sympathy for the\nUnion's demand. To convince the\nCollege and IC's Governing Body\nthe Union is to send a letter to all\nthe Governors outlining its case.\nThe Rector is to address the\nnext IC Union Council meeting\non 26th February at which the\nmain points of the campaign will\nbe put to him. Finally there will\nBody on 23rd March. To mount this campaign the\nUnion is asking for participation\nby as many students as p ossi be. The third line of attack is aimed at\nincreasing students' involvement\nand awareness of the problem.\nOPTIMISTIC External Affairs Officer Sheyne\nLucock told a FELIX reporter\nthat he was optimistic about the\nsuccess of the campaign but it will\nneed a lot of hard work. \"The more\npeople involved in the Lobbies of\nParliament and Governing Body the\ngreater the chances of success. If we fail it will be more due to student apathy\nthan the strength or otherwise of our\ncase.\" He was confident that a lot\nof people would want to work for\nthis campaign.\nThe Overseas Students' Committee will contribute by\nconducting a survey among IC's1000 overseas students in order to\nfind out what degree of financial\nhardship would result if fee\nincreases were to go ahead\nThe National Union of Students\nis not campaigning on this issue\nbut wishes IC Union the best of\nluck.\nNext Friday sees the 24 hr\npedal car race at Bristol. The race\nstarts at 3 pm on the 16th February. However the Guilds/IF Valentines party is to\nbe held in the J CR on the same\nnight and so Guilds have a smaller\nteam of supporters. This year,\nonly 30 are going down to Bristol.\nThe Mines Bottle match against\nWass, pedal car captains\nCambourne also clashes with the\nend of the pedal car race. The Guilds captain, Pete Wright, is\nconfident that Guilds will win and\nMines will come 2nd. There are\nover 40 teams in the race. The Mines women have always won\nthe ladies prize and are confident\nof another win this year.\nIC MOTION AT S RC Imperial College Union's third motion to the University of\nLondon Union this session was accepted without opposition\nlast week.\nThe motion, calling for the Senate House Library to be open\nto the public, was one of four motions to be passed at\nWednesday's meeting of the Students' Representative Council.\nThe S RC also agreed to hold a one day Alternative Prospectus\nconference under the auspices of UL U. This was proposed by the S RC Executive in accordance with a decision taken at its last meeting. The\nconference's aim would be to encourage colleges of the University to\nproduce their own Alternative Prospectuses which could be printed in\nSpring 1980 and be available for the prospective 1981 student entry.\nThe conference may also investigate a joint London University\nAlternative Prospectus.\nImperial is at present the only college in London University\nproducing an Alternative Prospectus. The S RC Executive is to liaise\nwith ICU in organising the conference.\nAnother motion passed at the S RC meeting called for London colleges not to timetable any courses on Wednesday; afternoons so that\nthis period could be set aside for sport.\nThe S RC also resolved to support East European dissidents and\nencourage college unions to do likewise.\ncontinued on back page\n\n"

OCTOPUS HL This week your roving reporter\ntravelled with the London University\nteam to Stirling for the British Students\nSports Federation Championships. Just\nfor a change, the first team at least,\nwere at full strength and expectations\nwere high.\nThe journey up on Friday was pretty\nuneventful apart from a few incidents at\nEdinburgh Station where Bryan had a 'push-pull' on the Glasgow line, and the whole team\nwas herded from platform to platform to find\na train which had not been cancelled.\nOn arrival at Stirling, the first team went\nlo their ace om mod ation in the Halls of\nResidence and enjoyed a dinner of steak and\nmineral vat ers. whilst the second team\nstayed in boarding houses and had fish and\nchips and at ew pints ol Heavy.\nSaturday morning was spent playing at '\ntourists around the castle and spent\nmourning over the tragic news that our guest\nrelay runner Sid was dead (innocent?).\nThe first race ol the afternoon was the\nladies. In this we had great hopes that Kath Binns of LSE would win. She due ly complied,\nleading almost all the way round the 2.5 mile\ncourse, to finish about 200 yards clear. She\nwas ably supported by Anne Baldock and\nDawn Williamson who finished 36th and\n37th. and thereby just won 3rd place team\nmedals.\nInspired by this tremendous start, the\nmen's second team, who ran next, put on a wonderful performance. At the end of the\nfirst lap. all six of our runners were well\nplaced. They maintained their effort\nthroughout the second lap to produce an\nexcel lant result. Ian Morton had a truly\nremarkable run. posing for the camera\nhalfway round he went on to finish 9th. One\nplace behind was Jim Medes of UC. Mike Kelly stayed calm as usual and finished about\n20th. Bryan Acford had an indescribable run\nto come about 30th. The two men who have\nrun more BS.SF- than the rest of the team\ntogether. Dave Rosen and Paul Clarke, were\nabout 40th and 50th. This magnificent team\nperformance earned them 3rd place, but\nunfortunate lv. due to politics, no prizes - we\nare not member- of U. A.U.. the second team\nrace organiser-.\nFinally came the first team race. A high\nclass field of near lv400. including several\ninternationals, thundered off at the start.\nThis would be the race which would\ndistinguish the men from the boys. At the end\nof the first lap three men had moved well\nclear ol the main body of runners. All the\nL'.L. team were well placed in the pack. This\npicture remained almost unchanged throughout the -er on d lap and so was set for\nan in trig in s final one.\nLappine several of the boys before the\nfinish. John Davies of W' LI HE. a silver\nmedalist in the Commonwealth Games\nsteeplechase. finished a clear winner,\ncompleting the 7.5 miles in under 35 minutes. .\nDave Clarke, also of W' LI HE. was second\nand Xi ck Brawn, of Oxford, thud\nFirst UL man home was Graham Jackson\n' RH Cj whose tremendous efl on. on the last\nlap in gaining a dozen places, placed him 7th. Captain Ian Duncan' LC, also improved the\nfur'her he went to finish 34th. ko b Kennan\nwas next in 62nd. and John Leonard\n( Goldsmith's) wasn't far behind in\n75th. Imperial's very own Steve Kirk had a good run to finish 78th, and Don de Savignev\nOcto who? Octopus h!A form of\nunderwater hockey played by teams of eight\nplayers using wooden pushers in an attempt\nto direct a lead disc (the \"squid\") into the\nopposing team's gull (goal). If that doesn't seem challenging enough, aqualung s are\nforbidden. All pushing of the squid (or other\nteam!) has to be done underwater whilst\nholding one's breath.\nI.C. Underwater Club fielded ('pooled') a successful team in 1971 which came third in\nthose National Championships. Then the\ngame became forgotten at I.C. Last May a new team was formed to compete in the\nNational Ladder (over 100 teams) and the\nLondon and Home Counties League. Only\nseven months later they had qualified for the\nQuarter Final of the National Octopush\nChampionships held at Southsea on 27th January.\nIt was a great moment when Nick Kyratos\nscored the first gull against Croydon, the\neventual winners. This injury to their pride\ncaused an explosive outburst from one of the\nCroydon players - who was answered\nvociferously by the spectators! Despite this\nincident, the I.C. team produced a very\ncreditable performance. This year we made\nthe quarter finals; next year???\nThe I.C. team was:-P. Fearnhead. P. Grimsey. N. Kyrtatos. C. Bommer, C. Leming, C. Skellett, I. Anderson,\nD. Lewis.\nIf you would like to join this growing sport,\ncome to the IC pool at 8.00pm any Thursday.\nTABLE TENNIS\nThere were only two matches a fortnight\nago, hence no report, but one almost\ndeserved an article itself - the first team\ndefeated the top team in their league -Gainsord III (away) by the margin 7-2. This\nwas, without doubt, their best performance\nthis season, and gave them an outside chance\nof promotion.\n(team: Lakhani, Kumar, Hong).\nLast week they played the second best\nteam in div 4.Barbican I unfortunately this\nwas an 8-1 defeat, but still did not completely\nruin their promotion hopes.\nThe 2nds also played a fortnight ago,\nbeating T.W.A. I.( Home) by 7-2 - this was\nWAT FR POLO On Wednesday 31st,I.C. Water\nPolo Club played a match in the London\nKnockout against the London club, 'The\nAmphibians'. The game started due to\nhandicapping with the score at 1 : 4,\nI.C. trailing.\nI.C. started the game in great form\npushing forward and completely dominating\nthe game. This enabled Mike McCartney\nto score three goals within as many minutes,\nand to make the score even. Pete\nMcCartney scored our fourth goal with a long and very hard shot. Mike scored his\nfourth and while attempting another was\nviciously fouled and we were awarded a penalty. Paul Hindle took it and got the ball\nin from the rebound. The score after the first\nquarter was 7 : 4. I.C. now slowed down\nand in the second quarter only one goal was\nscored by Cliff Spooner. The Amphibians\npushed forward and started to play with\nmore confidence. Steve Tayler, who was\nplaying in goal, was kept on his toes and\nmade some very good saves.\nIn the third quarter I.C. appeared to fall\napart and The Amphibians scored three\ngoals, while we only scored one, a shot in a man-up position from Andy Smith. In the\nfinal quarter the story was again the same\nwith The Amphibians scoring three and Pete\nscoring again to make the final score a10:10 draw. A very poor score to a game\nwhich I.C. should have won with ease.\nTeam: M McCartney, PMcCartney, (.'Spooner, P Hindle. A Smith, S Tayler, I) Dunstone, P Mills.\nanother good victory and they can still win\ntheir division.\nThe thirds had yet another disastrous\ndefeat by Sainsburys II (Away) where Reed\n(no excuses) and myself (20 pints worth of\nexcuses) won one game out of six (and it\nwasn't me), Jeff Stean scraped three wins and\nthe result was 4-5. Seven of the nine sets went\nto three games.\nThe fourths had a match last week against\nTrinity House Y. C., but yet again this team\nfailed to turn up for a match and we won by\ndefault.\nI think I 'll crash out now.\nSuper Drunk\ncompleted the scoring six in 95th position.\nJust for good measure, Colin Liziere (LSE)\nwas 101st. and Chris Swaine (Bart's)121st. In\nthe team race, which was won for the nth\ntime by Birmingham, UL did exceptionally\nwell to be 5th their best result for many\nyears. A further mention here for Dave Rosen\nwho after completing 2 laps in the previous\nrace, went for a 'training run' in this one and\nwas still about 220th. Messrs. Morton, Acford and Kelly proceeded to make an undignified entrance\nto the tearoom/presentation, through the\nwindow, at which point everyone else\ndisowned them. The video recording of the\nrace also proved to be amusing.\nAnd so to the evening's festivities. The\nentertainment provided for our benefit did\nnot have any drinks until 9 o 'clock. Therefore\nabout 100 students proceeded to mingle with\nthe local theatre connoisseurs in the Arts\nCentre. During the ensuing race across the\ncampus to the disco, Ian Morton fell for the\nfirst time, thus starting what was to become a regular habit later in the evening. As the\ndisco proved to be very similar to an IC one\n'very few females), someone suggested we try\nthe one down the road in the local pub.\nGaining free admission via our pass out s from\nthe first disco, we decided to show the natives\nwhat po going was all about. Unfortunately,\nthey did not seem to be too impressed. Our diplomatic aide, Paul Clarke, successfully\nagitated the situation, and, with the clans\ngathering against us, we decided it was time\nto make a technical advance- backwards.\nEater that night, Paul reappeared heavily\ndisguised for fear of reprisals. So we were\nforced to take the first disco by storm again.\nSteve 'Beverly' Kirk was nominated for the\nBS SF disco dance championship, arid we\neasily won the team award.\nAfter ransacking the first teams rooms, the\nseconds crawled the two miles back to the\nboarding house at 2.30. Before lights out, Ian\n'funny how you lose your sense of balance'\nMorton demonstrated how to fall out of bed\nwithout even being in it in the first place.\nAt 10.30 the following morning, hordes of\nvoiceless, bleary-eyed (athletic?) students\nwere seen to board a southbound train back\nto civilisation, taking the scenic route:\nEdinburgh-Carlisle-Newcastle-London!\nSo in one weekend we achieved two 3rd team places, one 5th, an individual winner,\nand helped to further Anglo-Scottish race\nhatred. Not bad. eh Jimmy? Team Mc Manager "

There were some teething troubles at first but it's working again now!\nMore FELICE S After numerous requests for more FELICE S to be left in\ndepartments I decided to increase the print run to 4000. This\nmeans that there will be about 50 to a hundred extra copies per\ndepartment, depending on its size. If all these are taken then the\nprint run will stay at 4000.\nMore Staff Since printing this extravaganza now takes about half an hour\nlonger per run than it did before, a lot of paste -ups have to be\nready by Wednesday. This means that more st afl are needed to\nhelp on Tuesday afternoons and evenings. Those of you lucky\nenough to volunteer will have the added delight of the Brovid\nMaker and Typesetter to play with, as if headlining wasn't enough fun.\nCollating, of course, takes longer now and starts around 7.00\npm on Thursdays in the FELIX Office. Phoenix The cultural magazine of IC now has an Editor, \" Eric\" Jarvis. Any stories, poems or photos of an \"artistic\" nature\nwould be most welcome. If you would like to contribute to\nPhoenix, then drop your copy into the envelope in the FELIX Office. Essays or features that are too long for FELIX(1000 words plus) will also be gratefully accepted.\nRCM Canteen Once in a while the number of IC students using the RCM Canteen grows to the point of overcrowding. At the moment we\nare still welcome but only after 1.30 p.m. Please try and stay out\nuntil then otherwise we will be banned altogether.\nU GM There is aUG M on Tuesday13 th at 1 pm in the Great Hall. Motions on the agenda include the Legalisation of\nCannabis and Housing. There is no motion on Iran so you've no\nexcuse for not turning up! Cheers\nJohn NOT JUST FOR KICKS\nIn College men outnumber women by about eight to one but the\nwomen 'a problems do not end there.\nOnly Beit, Falmouth and Selkirk have places for women in halls. The\nrest are a com mo dated in digs or flats out in the wilds of Hammersmith\nor Earls Court etc. and must frequently face a walk home alone from a tube station or bus stop after an evening at IC.\nI am reminded of Trevor Phillip's remark that all colleges should run a women's self defence class. It would, under the circumstances, seem no\nmore than normal prudence to do so.\nThis new venture organised by Merche Clark and Sue Owen deserves\nsupport for the women and encouragement from the men.\nThe Group has been meeting in the Union Building for a few weeks\nnow. They have not been able to secure a regular room but can usually\nbe found in the Gym. The instructor is qualified and requires \u00a310 per\nweek for her services.\nThis money has to be found from somewhere.\nInitial low attendance resulted in fees of \u00a31 so the group decided to\nappeal to ICWA for assistance. The Association was not convinced that the idea would be successful but granted 21 green ones to help reduce\nthe cost.\nLast Thursday the organisers held a Jumble Sale, raising 50 pounds\n(of which \u00a325 went to the Creche). I would like to see the Group thrive\nand ICWA invest more money to sub sid is e the cost.\nThe numbers have been, on the face of it, disappointing.\nI think many women believe the Group to be too reactionary - a get-together of political Amazons. Yet I know many girls are frightened of\nLondon, particularly after dark.\nAlthough those attending are taught how to punch, where to kick and\nother movements, a lot of emphasis is put on repelling fear. It seems\nplenty of background work has been done concerning attacks on\nwomen; to sort out why they happen and the best ways to prevent their\noccurrence.\nGirls that scare easily are more prone to attack and, believe it or not\nthe assaulter s are easily discouraged if stood up to.\nThe whole idea of the class is to give them this self-confidence.\nDon't worry fell as. They have promised not to declare martial law in\nthe archaic corridors of IC. and ladies : make an effort to attend. The\nnext meeting will be in the Gym at 7.30 pm on Monday.\nI can well imagine that it's fun and a great social occasion and I bet\nthat it breeds a number of stiff students for Tuesday mornings!\nI'm quite familiar with such events though, having had them at school\nThey are enjoyable if you take the trouble to get involved but students\ntend to feel tremendously overworked; too busy to bother, when such\npains as lab-reports, projects and problem sheets, only lead to the\ndistress of examinations. Any minor disturbance to the strict routine is\ndreaded like the plague.\nIt's a shame that so much organization achieves so little, gaining such\nlow levels of respect. I wonder if it's worthwhile.\nTake Care,\nJohn Shuttleworth\nTHIS HOUSE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY A DE BSC)C DEBATE IN ME CHENG542 ATl. OO P MONTH URS FEB151 H W f HE CHA \u00ae\nAnother Contact Week has been and gone. The only contact I had was\nthe supplement in FELIX. I'm not complaining but I am surprised.\nADMISSION FREE TO MEMBERS MEMBERSHIP 20p "
