    "content": "1. Much cf the organised entertainment is useful and should be kept.\nSub-sections of I.C. Ents could deal with formal balls, carnivals and\ninformal dances.\nRivalry does not have to be initiated by Constituent Colleges. Most Universities have groups which engage in friendly rivalry and if there were no Constituent Colleges rivalry would still be seen, probably\nthrough halls of residence and departments.\n2. The sporting clubs mostly exist only for the int<,r college trophies\nin each sport. The more important sports e.g. Rugby, have their own teams\nbut I see no reason why I.C. cannot arrange matches as for soccer.\nAcademic clubs are usually department ally based and there is no\nreason why they cannot carry on as they are.\n3. Academic Affairs at the moment are dealt with mostly by the constituent\ncolleges. There are staff-student committees in each department and each\nconstituent college has an academic officer( rep) who co-ordinates activities for the constituent colleges. As one who has been particularly involved\nin this aspect of union activity, I have thought hard about this subject.\nThe Joint Rector Governing Body and Student discussion body, JURGO, concerns\nitself to a considerable extent with academic affairs. Having worked in both\nR.C.S. and I.C., on academic affairs I feel that it is at an I.C., not\nconstituent college level that we need academic affairs expertise, the\nconstituent college intermediate level being merely an encumbrance.\nOne reason for the existance of constituent colleges is historical. I.C. and I.C.U. has always been sub sectioned in this way. But, in the last few years students have been much more involved in doo is i ori making than\npreviously and have, therefore, had to change their thinking accordingly. For example, Student Welfare and academic affairs have become very important\nand deserve? to have first class people running them.\nFor the important job of running I.C.U, we deserve much more coordinated action than the constituent colleges allow. I.C. must be sub-sectioned, but the sub-sections do not. have to be autonomous. Remember,\nwhen you vote that if you vote for constituent colleges you are voting\nfor 3 autonomous unions. I submit that tae se constituent colleges weaken\nImperial College Union.\nThe Case for the Existence of ICWA\nImperial College Women's Association, or ICWA as it is commonly called, fulfils several important functions. It is encouraging more women to come\nhere by arranging for girls to go back to their schools to talk about I.C. and by meeting female interviewees, so that they can ask questions about the\ncollege and so that we can attempt to encourage them to come here. ICWA\norganises fresher arrangements from the first week of term, which range from\nmeeting fresher s at the Royal Geographical Society, to entertaining them to\ncoffee throughout the week, if they want to come. Besides this, ICWA\norganises various social functions throughout the year, and acts as an\nofficial body through which contact can be made. It also ensures that the\nwomen have a voice on council, which they elect themselves and who they\nprobably all know.\nWhether you believe that ICWA should exist or not depends on whether\nyou think that its activities are desirable or not. One of them main\narguments against ICWA is its 'per capita* grant. This argument can also\nbe used against the Constituent College Unions and I.C.U. itself because\nalthough it is 'compulsory' to be a member, it is always voluntarily that\none takes part. At this time some women are beginning to make their own way in this college and I welcome this as it is a sign that ICWA is achieving its end\nfor ICWA is trying to increase its numbers sufficiently so that it does not\nneed to exist; until then I would urge you to support the existence of ICWA.\ncontinued\n\n"

THEV\nTELL\nME\nby Les Ebdon\nSo much has happened since this column was last written\nthat one is hesitant to write anything unless it is overtaken\nby events. The reverberations from LSE have caused changes\nin attitudes in IC not far short of revolutionary.\nThe first Union reaction, from Guilds, to the LSE dispute\nwas predictable, especially with memories of the distasteful\nevents at ULU still fresh. The press, clutching at straws to\nprove Ted Short's\" agitator theory \", reported the affair in\nlurid detail. Corr and Marshall must have come close to adding a TV appearance to their other glamour prizes. Within a week of this meeting RCSU and ICU passed radically\ndifferent motions. Why ?\nProbably the attempts to present the Guilds' decision\ntraditionally a\" sporty Union \", as a sign of support for the\nAdams-Short hard-line attitude brought some reaction. The\nidea that all the trouble at LSE is caused by thirteen\n\" academic thugs \" is a far from satisfactory answer to the\ncomplex student problems there. As rumours of the manner\nin which the Guilds' meeting was called spread, and details\nof its conduct discussed, further reaction was engendered.\nOne Guildsman told me : \" I only heard about the meeting\non the morning and I was told the motion affected student\ngrants, but our year rep did not know the wording.\" Opposition speeches were apparently drowned in jeers.\nFurther stimulation to the radical iz ation of IC students\nwas given by the vote of the LSE students, at Friends House\non 3rd of February. The by now famous \" no victimization,\nno gates, no police\" motion finally killed the \" agitator\ntheory \".\nIt was these events, plus a new spirit amongst first and\nsecond year undergraduates, and increased activity by overseas students, that provided the majorities for the more\nmilitantly worded motions of support for the LSE students\nat both the RCSU and ICU meetings.\nThere were some attempts by the old guard right-wing to\nquench this grass-roots fire. Chem. PG. rep., Rodney Hobbs,\nWeeks hall's stirring barman, brought a large contingent of\nChemistry P.G. s to RCSU, but the establishment relied on\nthe old curse of in quo racy to prevent ICU passing any pro-LSE motions. So great has the swing of opinion been that\neven old-guard left-wingers have been amazed and outpaced\nby popular opinion.\nIt now seems Certain that the ordinary member of ICU is\nreaching out for some kind of power\u2014let us hope we can all\nuse it responsibly.\nAfter the last issue of Felix I received an anonymous\nletter containing certain interesting \" information \" I do not\nuse anonymous letters but if \" IC theatre-lover \" would come\nforward perhaps I can use what he tells me.

    "content": "4\nThe Case against the Existence of i CW A In all recent discussion concerning ICWA, no-one appears to have\nexplained why it exists in the first place. As I understand it, ICWA\nexists to provide female representation in the Union and to protect the\nfirst year gir is from the leering males of this college. This may have\nb \u00ab_en necessary in the days when there were only a doj en or so Icwarians,\nbut today the situation is totally different, Excluding the ICWA President, there are three women en this year's Council, thus clear}y making the 'female representation' angle totally irrelevant. Isum pathi so with those girls wh> find it difficult to adjust\nto university life, and would like to see some form of social club to help\nthem. But I cannot see why this necessitates a grant of \u00a3350 a year from\nthe Union.\nWhat does ICWA do with this money? It is spent on ICWA sport, the\nICWA Formal and numerous sherry parties for ICWArians. In this way ICWA\nhas effectively set itself up as a fourth constituent college. Is this necessary? I should say no. ICWA sport could be handled quite adequately\nby ACC and a special, application for a grant could be cade for the ICWA\nFormal<,\n\u2022 It would be grossly unfair for ECU to merely disband ICWA. If the\nwomen of I.C. want their own .society then they should be allowed-to have\none, ' : v\\,I do not believe, however, that ICWA deserves its present status. The only direct action that ICU should take i.j to transfer ICWA to SCC,\nwhere it would receive a gr ;nt appropriate to its needs.\nIt is, perhaps, worth noting that only about kC F/i of Icwarians play\nany par-'; in ICWA. The need for reform is clearly. imminent though this must come from within ICWA.\nI would occlude by saying that in its present form ICWA is an\nexpensive an a chr cri Hra, it is time the system was changed.\nExecutive - For and Against\nThe duties of the Executive a:; laid dow*. in the Constitution, are\nto deal with matters of urgency and the day to day running of the Union,\nThe Executive consists of the President, Deputy President, Secretary\nand three Constituent College Presidents, and meets -ea week during\nterm time.\nThe day to day running of the Union e \u00bb g. furnishings and the booking\nof rooms can now be dealt with by the newly formed house corm it tee. In\npractise the Executive deal With urgent matters and anything concerning\nthe Constituent College Unions and usually has very little do do. Since\nCouncil is now meeting approximately once a fortnight, instead of twice\na term as previously, the number of urgent matters has dropped correspond-ingly. The argument against the existence of the Executive is that there\nnow exists very little for it to do. It is very difficult for such a group of people to meet regularly and do nothing and so the temptation\nwill always exist to bring up matters which should properly be dealt with\nby Council or a union meeting. Hatters concerning the Constituent Colleges\ncould easily be dealt with elsewhere.\nAgainst this, some other body would have to be called( rather than\nmeet regularly), to deal with any genuine matters of urgency. Whilst\nthis could be done fairly easily, it is certainly not as convenient as\nhaving regular meeting;.!.\nThe choice is between as light ii crease of in con veni en re, and a possible increase of more democratic decisions "

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX 20th February, 1969\n\"A sustained enquiry jn to the roots of our present possibilities and disc\nAmong several high sounding words and phrases\nwhich have come into use\nand misuse during the past\ndecade, the \"underground\"\nand the \"avant-garde\" seem\nto have come to stay. Most\npeople have some idea as to\nthe general concept of the\nunderground movement in\nthe arts, but to many the\navant garde is just a vague\nphrase connected with modern art.\nThe Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) describes\nthe avant-garde as a name\ngiven to artists working in\nand exploring the spaces\nbetween the general classifications of Art \u2014 Painting,\nSculpture, Music, etc., and\nthe gaps between artist and\naudience. The ICA is at the\ncentre of the avant-garde\nmovement in England, the\nlargest arts centre in London and one of the biggest\nin Britain.\nThe idea of such a centre\nwas first formed in 1936 at\nthe time of the first International Surrealist Exhibition, but progress was\ndelayed by the war and the\nICA was not founded officially untl 1947, in the basement of the Academy\ncinema in Oxford St. In the\nfollowing year it moved to\nmore permanent premises in\nDover St., off Piccadilly,\nwhere it remained until just\ntwo years ago. The founding\ngroup included Sir Herbert\nRead, who saw the ICA as\na group experimenting with\nand promoting education\nthrough art in Britain, and\nSir Roland Penrose, who saw\nit more as a link between\ncreative activity in Britain\nand on the Continent.\nBesides producing the\nfirst London exhibitions of\nwork by several leading\nforeign artists, including\nCartier-bres son and Dubuffet, the ICA was instrumental in laying the foundations\nof what is now known as\nPop Art.\nNow the ICA is the major\nmember of five separate\nsocieties occupying Nash\nHouse in the Mall and has\ncome under the directorship\nof Michael Kustow, formerly of the Royal Shakespeare\nCompany. Kustow believes\nthat the experimental art\nbeing produced today should\nnot all have its origins in\nthe underground; that mainstream institutions like the\nICA can also provide top-grade non-traditional work.\nHe sees the aim of the ICA\nto be to provide \" a free\nspace in which the deepest\nquestions of the age which\nconcern us as individuals\nand as a society can be explored in continuity, not just\nas a series of colour supplements or television discussions but as a sustained\nenquiry into the roots of our\npresent possibilities and dis-contents.\"\nThe new premises house\nfacilities for all the arts,\nincluding a modern cinema,\na theatre for 250 people, an\nart gallery, a restaurant and\na bar. The gallery provides\nan outlet for the works of\nvisual artists wishing to experiment outside the restricting influence of the commercial galleries, and a similar function is preformed\nby the ICA cinema.\nOutlet The theatre caters for\nplaywrights trying to break\naway from traditional theatrical form. The conditions\nof the commercial theatre\npreclude the permanent\ncompanies and long rehearsal periods the most committed actors and directors\nneed, and although the\nsub sidi sed theatres do not\nhave to be concerned with\n\" box-office\" to such an\nextent, they are still committed to public work which\nprevents their producing\nmuch experimental work.\nThe ICA provides a noncommercial outlet for directors and writers working in\nthis experimental branch of\nthe theatre.\nThe magazine Mix, which\nthe ICA produces, provides\nspace for writers trying new\nforms of expression, and\ntheir work can also be reviewed at readings and\nseminars held within the\nbuilding.\nPerhaps the most important area of the arts, how-ever, is that pertaining to\nmodern education, for there\nis a feeling that traditional\neducation is lacking in some\nessential moral and imaginative content which could\ngive it coherence, a role\nonce played by religion, but\nno longer so. The ICA is a centre where the work of\nthe professional artist and\neducation a list can be coordinated to fill this gap.\nIn brief, then, the Institute exists to break down\nthe barriers between artist\nand audience and replace\nthe few discerning patrons\nof the arts with a more or\nless mass public, and to provide the avant-garde with\nthe physical recognition and\nfacilities that the RSC\naffords the theatre and\nopera.\nTo use another word\nwhich has taken on a new\nmeaning in the past few\nyears, the ICA is the centre\nof a new scene, a counter-scene to the underground, a meeting place for the artist\nand audience which that\nloose nucleus of ideas and\nsystems cannot supply.\nLeft: Nash\nHouse, home\nof the ICA.\n\"A Bitter\nFinancial\nWinter . . .\nDespite a huge success in\nbuilding up its membership\nto 10,000 in nine months\n(this was originally the target for twelve months), the\nICA faces what Michael\nKustow describes as \" a bitter financial winter \". This\nposition has arisen because\nof the failure of the Arts\nCouncil to meet ICA's estimation of a reasonable\ngrant. When the ICA moved\nto Nash House, they presented a set of estimates to\nthe Arts Council for the cost\nof the new operation. This\nthey claimed would be\n\u00a375,000 per year, which they\nconsidered reasonable in\ncomparison with the \u00a390,000\nsubsidy received by the\nRoyal Court Theatre. The\nArts Council allowed them\nonly \u00a325,000. which merely\ncovered the rent and ser vi ces.\nThe ICA thus started a mass recruiting drive, which\nhas proved to be an outstanding success. Admissions\nand membership fees together brought in \u00a346,000,\nwhich still leaves a deficit of\n\u00a334,000. The cost of mount-ing, preparing and advertising their programme is cited\nby Kustow as the main reason for the large deficit, and\nthe lack of foresight in not\ncomparing these costs with\nthe expected income.\nThe first year was rather\nspecial, however, as costs for\nsuch expenditures as equip-ing the gallery, creating the\nmembership campaign, and\npaying for the introductory\npublicity will not have to be\nmet in the future. The ICA\nis still nevertheless left with\nthe job of repaying the def i cit, and to this end they\nhave brought a few economies into force, for example\nthe Magazine has been sus-pended.\nThey are also appealing\nfor help from their friends,\nboth industrial concerns and\nprivate individual, to help\nthem through their present\nfinancial difficulties.\nThe demand for a centre\nsuch as the ICA has been\nshown in the large membership they have built up over\na short period of just one\nyear. Everyone who has visited any of their functions\nwill realise that in the range\nand quality of its productions, the ICA is unique as\na non-Underground organisation catering for the tastes\nof the younger generation,\nand I for one would hate\nto see it dissolve because of\nthe financial problems it has\nmet in getting off the\nground.\n. . . in the\nHeart of\nTraditional\nLondon\"\n\n"

    "content": "20th February, 1969 FELIX Page 5\nSHOULD THE CONCORDE BE CANCELLED? Last week a full-page advertisement suggesting the cancellation of the Concorde appeared in the Guardian. It was\nsigned by some five hundred people from many walks of life,\nthough predominantly from the Arts and Science side, with\njust a few Engineers.\nThe advertisement raised the question of the validity of\ncontinuing the development of the Concorde assuming that\nsonic boom will prove unacceptable overland. It also questioned the amount of money spent on the project, when there\nare still many underdeveloped areas in the world which could\nmake better use of the finances.\nHere we have the case put both for and against the Project.\nAttacking the continuation of Concorde is Mr. D.C. Macdonald, lecturer in the Elec. Eng. Department, whose name\nappeared on the advertisement. In defence we have Mr. F.G. Irving, Senior Lecturer in the Aeronautics Department.\nThe case for cancellation by\nD.C. Macdonald\nThe Concorde will almost certainly be a financial failure\neven if it is a technical success. The Government will do all\nit can to minimise the loss and maximise the sales. Most\nflights across the Atlantic start on the Continent, and operators will certainly try to fly supersonic ally across Britain.\nAs yet there is no fixed policy, and one can see governments\nallowing overland flights in order to sell more aircraft and\nminimise the loss.\nTo permit supersonic flights over populated areas would\nbe a vicious invasion of every worthwhile human activity:\nin the concert hall, in the lecture room, in the lab, in the\npark, watching the box, holding up the bar, even lying in\nbed \u2014 BANG BANG \u2014 shattering, destructive of thought\nand mind, all pervading (except perhaps on the Picadilly\nLine). If you are a light sleeper it will wake you, if the baby\nis teething it will wake him, not just once every night, but\nsix, eight or ten times.\nThis misery may have to be borne just because a fraction\nof a per cent of the population want to get to New York\nCity Centre in five hours instead of seven; and because when\na technological challenge presents itself our modern society\nfeels bound to accept it.\n. . . and the case against by F.G. Irving\nThe whole raison d'e tre of air transport is speed. Let us\nnot argue whether it would be nice to return to more leisurely\nways of life: it is a fact that the travelling public wants speed.\nSo far, the introduction of newer, faster, aircraft has always\ngenerated more demand and, in real terms, has provided\ncheaper travel. We have now achieved a situation in which\nthe cheapest way of taking people (and some sorts of things)\nover appreciable distances is to put them in a Boeing 707\nor a VC-10, and any packaged holiday operator who can\nonly offer propeller-aeroplanes might as well invite the\nbailiffs in.\nThere are, of course, incidental advantages: jet travel is\nsmooth, comfortable and, unless one is totally bored with\nlife in general, immensely interesting.\nThere is no sign that any of these trends will be reversed\nby providing even more speed, except that it may be necessary to accept some increase in cost. Even this may be a transient effect, associated with first-generation supersonic\naircraft. To go faster with sufficient efficiency, we have to\ngo quite a lot faster. So, the first supersonic airliners are\ndesigned for a little over twice the speed of sound.\nLet us accept that cutting journey times by over 50 per\ncent is likely to be very popular with travellers, and let us not\nforget that potential objectors are also travellers on occasions.\nThe only possible objection to Concorde (or supersonic airliners in general) is the social one of noise. In all other re-There are tremendous opportunities in the modern world,\nand we must pursue the worthwhile projects with the utmost\nenthusiasm and vigour if we are to remain a wealthy and\nprogressive nation and make our proper contribution to the\nlife of mankind. We must learn to distinguish the progressive\ndevelopments from those which will make our existence less\nrewarding. The drug-industry has given us penicillin, and I for one might not be about now without the help of streptomycin, but the same industry produced thalidomide babies\nand may give us chemical warfare. Concorde may give rise\nto a waste of money on the scale of the now-proverbial\nground-nuts scheme, and a social disaster comparable with\nthe living conditions produced at the beginning of the industrial revolution.\nThe argument that Concorde is just a stepping-stone to\nquiet supersonic flight is false. There are several military\nsupersonic aircraft \u2014 why cannot they be used to develop\na whispering chariot for the modern plutocrat?\nEngineers often pride themselves on being men who give\nthe best for the least money, but they are often rightly regarded as people who do this with little regard for beauty\nor social amenity. It is those who are involved in a project\nwho have the primary responsibility for taking all factors\ninto account and facing up to the eventual outcome. We\nmust use our understanding of the physical world and our\nvision of the consequences to straggle the monster-projects\nspec ts, in addition to the traveller's viewpoint, it is likely\nto be highly advantageous. The potential orders for Concorde\nwill bring immense wealth to this country, providing a significant amount of work and keeping us firmly at the sharp end\nof technology.\nConsiderable research is in hand on reducing both engine\nnoise and sonic booms, but it is only fair to admit that the\nsituation is likely to get worse before it gets better. Most of\nthe anti-Concorde lobby argues that sonic booms will be\nintolerable, but this is by no means self-evident. In the middle\nof a large land-mass like the USA, they could become an\nunacceptable nuisance, but this is rather unlikely in the UK.\nFlight in and out of London would generally involve subsonic flight over land, and I suspect that the effects of over-flying (e.g. USA to Germany) would not be very great.\nWhilst admitting that Concorde brings its social problems,\nthese have to be weighed against the manifest desirability\nof the project from all other points of view, not the least\nof which is our long-term national prosperity. Objectors may\nfeel trapped by technology, but what is the alternative? To\nmy mind, sitting in our huts, of clay and wattle made, listening to the sonic booms generated by Boeings.\nIt would be the height of folly to opt out of Concorde at\nthis stage, and I hope it is only the beginning of a splendid\nfuture for British aviation.\nConcorde prototype 001 during the preliminary taxiing trials\nat Toulouse.

We would gain very little in terms of concessions (except\nsimplification) by joining and they are mostly abroad. The solid political issue is whether I.C. can gain from the wealth of experience the N.U.S. has\nin student affairs and the answer is of course, positive. It's well worth\nI.C. joining for a number of reasons.\nFor instance, the Joint Committee of the Union, the Governors and the\nRector (JURGO - look it up in the Calendar, P.33) has been discussing student discipline. The N.U.S. has been consulted by the Department of\nEducation and Science on this and has produced a well-thought out pamphlet\n(Code of Discipline) indicating guidelines for general procedures, one of\nwhich is no double punishment. The N.U.S, view here coincides with the I.C.U, view on disciplinary committees and double punishment.\nTed Short, Secretary of State for Education and Science has said that\n\"Students who had genuine grievances about . . . . . . universities..... would\nfind almost invariably today that they were negotiable and that they were\npushing at an open door\". The N.U.S, quite clearly can help us here.\nThe N.U.S. is the only national student union with mass membership\nand what it says is taken as being the student point of view. We must have\na share in shaping that point of view.\nThe cost of joining is5/ for students in an affiliated union, \u00a32\nfor individuals otherwise* The 5/- is paid by the Social Education\nAuthority with the fees etc. The N. Uc.Sc produces many useful publications on travel, grants, rents,\ninsurance, education, participation, vacation work, discounts advice and\ndisciplined N.U.S, is our national students union and while it leaves much to be\n-desired the N.U.S. is the student view. We must end our isolation and take\npart in the N.U.S. Against N.U.S. N.U.S. promised the following to students.\n1. To look after student welfare and to speak for students\nby building up a policy over the years.\n2. To provide c nea p travel3. To enable students to obtain certain price reductions\nand concessions.\nAs regards the first point of student welfare and representation,\nImperial College Union is large enough to put forward its own views to the Ministry of Education and U.G.C., and in fact has done so very\nef ect iv ely in the past. It is better for each Union to put forward its own needs, at her than have it done for them by such a large organisation as N.U.S, On the second point of cheap travel, most of us now know of many other\nother organisations such as G.S.T. S., I.S. T.S., Brian Hughes Ltd., which\nprovide travel at prices comparable with and, in many cases, better than\nthose of N,U.S. You have all heard of the glittering promises of concessions which\nN.U.S. has obtained and how hollow many of these promises are. N.U.S. claims to publish1500 concessions and I have found out that many of this number do not exist.

This is why we\nwant a plebiscite. Merits of Present system\nThe type or person who will be most suitable, as President or Secretary is better known by council who are better informed of the candidate's virtues than the general college. Council has to work in close liaison with both\nthe president and Secretary and it is thus better that they should choose\npeople with whore they can work in harmony. An intimate knowledge of the\nviews and ideas of the candidates can be built up during the intensive canvassing prior to the election. There is no possibility of rigging the\nelection. This system h.s& proved its effectiveness and should not be\nchanged for one that is, to say the least, unproved.\n7. Case for Departmental Reps on Council\nHaving Depcurtmental Reps on Council would produce several useful\nresults. Firstly, the Depto Rep. would provide (at last) the much needed link between I.C.U., the year reps, and the t tu dent floor. The concept of\nDepartmental Subcommittees (which especially in this kind of university Should provide the backbone of any flexible and efficient union administration) would achieve more prominence, and the clumsy and limited channels\nof communication via the constituent colleges wo^ld be bypassed.\nSecondly, while providing -\u2022. better contact between I.C.U. and\nits members, a departmental rep, is most likely to be an independent\nwhose aim is serving the student interest, and not that of perpetuating\nthe present petty political scene.\nThirdly, when the Architectural Association joins us, this system\nis the one which will most easily accommodate them.\nThe majority of students are apathetic as regards I.C.U. because\nthey feel they have little or no connection with it. The greater personal\ncontact between students, dept. reps and year reps.,( a much abused and\nneglected group of people doing very useful and important work) will make\nnot only for a much more effective union, but one which also serves its members in the way that they want it. Case Against Departmental \"u eps on Council\nAt present Council consists of 24 members of the Union and three old student reps and a Senior Treasurer. If departmental reps were on council\nit would become a very unwieldy body and Council is an organising body\nto deal with finance and discipline and is an easier body to manage if its members have specific jobs. Departmental reps would not. 3y having these\nreps on Council there would be a' centralisation of power' which is contrary\nto most peoples b lief s at present. Major policy decisions would be made\nby council because it would be felt that it was oi ore representative of the\nUnion members views, but this would take away the usefulness of the Union\nmeeting. In my opinion Council should be left at the size it is, enabling\nthe Union General meeting to make the major policy decisions,( and the\nvastly differing sizes of the departments could lead to over-representation in some cases,)\n\n"

Egoistic\nEbdon?\nDear Sir,\nI should like to say how\nimpressed I was by the very\ndefinite improvement in the\nlast issue of FELIX; not\nonly in printing and layout,\nbut also in content and the\nfactual style of reporting.\nOne thing, however, that\nrequires comment is that Mr.\nEbdon should use his opinion\ncolumn (I doubt if anyone\nwould agree with his statement that it is a\" news\ncolumn not an opinion\ncolumn\") to describe ideas\nthat he has put forward to\nthe constitutional reform\ncommittee as \" promising\nand vital.\" That appears to\nbe slightly egoistic a l.A further note. Speakers\nat our meeting may have\nbeen jeered but none were\n\" shouted down\" no matter\nwhat the national papers\nmay say. Isn't it ludicrous\nthat while one group who\nopposed the motion have\ndistributed sheets complaining about the press reporting\nof the event as \" misrepresenting, mis reporting, misleading \" you tell us to read\nthe nationals for an account\nof what actually happened.\nYours sincerely,\nDermott Corr\nLondon School of Hygiene\n& Tropical Medicine\nDear Sir,\nI was disgusted to read in\nthe National press the report\nof \" students of I.C.\" issuing\nhysterical statements about\nLSE. Fortunately I have\nsince learnt the true facts\u2014\nthat it was the opinions of a small minority of militant\nright-wingers\u2014and the press,\nnot unusually, had failed to\nmake this point clear. Despite\nthis it is still extremely disturbing to find out that these\nstudents had failed to use\ntheir intelligence sufficiently\nto study the situation before\nmaking such grossly inaccurate remarks. One wonders whether the taxpayer is\ngetting full value for his\nmoney\u2014scientists with un inquisitive minds ?\nNo Riots\nI took the trouble to\nattend the discussions at\nU.L. U.( which certainly became more dynamic and\nattractive during the occ up a tion) and to talk to L.S.E. students, including representatives of the \" moderate \"\nminority. At no time were\nthere \" riots\", academic\nthug ger y, intimidation etc.,\nwhich were all described so\nvividly in the press. The reports in the press indicated\nthat the press had been to\ncompletely different meetings\nto those I attended, though\nthey claimed them to be the\nsame. As some of your students know I am a little left\nof centre, but more conservative colleagues of mine will\nalso witness to the lies of the\npress.\nBad Reputation\nIt's about time the students of Imperial got off\ntheir fat arse s and started\nthinking of others, and not\njust themselves. No college in\nthe country has a worse\nreputation for its students'\nattitudes\u2014you'll find out\nwhen you leave. And if you\ncontinue to make statements\nas nonsensical as the ones\nmade about Tariq Ali the\nsituation can only worsen.\nYou are the students who\nare wasting the taxpayers\nmoney\u2014your prejudices, lack\nof thought and investigation\nand your conclusions founded\non no evidence are hardly\nindicative of good scientists.\nTf you look at those at I.C. who have had enough social\nconscience to concern themselves with moral and\npolitical problems you'll\nprobably find a rather high\nacademic standard also.\nThe Editor reserves the right to\nomit all or part of any letter\nsubmitted to Felix. Also, the\nopinions represented in these\nletters are not necessarily the\nopinions of Felix.\nBattery Bred\nImperial College will only\nachieve what it could do\nwhen it stops producing its\nbattery bred apathetic s and\nstarts giving the country\nsome free range products.\nFinally I'd like to remind\nI.C. of its past, I like to\nthink it's changed, a record\nof drunken violence against\nproperty and persons. One\nonly has to look through\nFELIX for the damage to\nproperty, and some of the\nattacks on persons (Morphy\nDay etc.). While I was at I.C. several people were beaten\nup by one well known personality on one night and no\naction was taken. I myself\nreceived a warning, addressed from certain rugby\nplayers, to watch out on a dark night, because I wished to make the Union\nmore democratic. Also an\nT.C. President, during his\nterm of office, threatened to\nsmash my head in for\nopposing him.\nBefore condemning L.S.E. for violence against steel\ngates placed there to pro-v oke, look at your own un-justified, meaningless vio-len ce. You really make me want\nto puke.\nYours very sincerely,\nMalcolm Duckett\nDear Sir,\nFreedom is not a luxury\nbut the recognition of necessity. But democracy in this\ncountry is based upon the\nidea that it is a concession\nallowed to us by the generous\nauthorities, and is built up\nin terms of a static morality\nbased on ideas of absolute\nright and wrong, which it is\nwrong to challenge. As\nMoses said, \" thou shalt\nnot kill\", \" thou shaft not\ncommit adultery \", and now\nfrom FELIX \" thou shalt\nnot stir up trouble where no\ntrouble exists \". But how can\nkilling be always wrong,\nadultery always wrong and\nmost confusing of all how\non earth can trouble be\nstirred up where, we are told\nno trouble exists.\nThe ' trouble ' is socialists.\nWe do exist and come to our\nconclusions and act upon\nthem in such a way as to\nachieve the most success,\nand publicise our point of\nview in the most effective\nway. Obedience is the same\nvirtue as mediocrity in a mediocre society. The contradiction of minority action\nnot being condemned by the\nmajority will always be with\nus. Democracy is for the\nprotection of minorities. If\ndemocracy means more than\nhot air it means freedom to\ndissent and take action inside the existing structures\n(which are ridiculous enough\nanyway).\nThe majority can dissociate themselves, as they have\ndone: (C&G Union made\nabsolute fools of themselves;\nR.C.S. Union were more\ncivilised). The minority who\nsent the letter have insulted\nSir,\nThe criticism from I.C. of\nthe L.S.E. students centres\naround the use of violence.\nBearing in mind the records\nof the groups concerned\n(need I say Morphy ?) and\nthe fact that the L.S.E. students only attacked selected\nobjects, not persons, and\nonly after much discussion,\nthis is hypocrisy bordering\non the illogical. One may\nconclude that they do not\ncondemn violence, but mass\npolitical action.\nMass action is something\nstrange to I.C.; it is not\nunderstood and is feared.\nPeople feel it might somehow lead to totalitarianism.\nTheir answer is to leave the\ncommand of information and\ndecision making to the controlling hierarchy, who reinforce their position by resisting change in most aspects of\ncollege life. Occasionally,\nhowever, even the do zi est student wants to change\nsomething. When such\nno-one, but have as yet not\neven received an acknowledgement which is less than\ncourteous of the Rector.\nNow what about the letter\nitself ? We asked the Rector\nto clarify his position on\ncertain fundamental principles of freedom in universities (implied by our ques-tion):\n(1) Freedom of movement\nand hence association.\n(2) Political freedom from\nPolice.\n(3) Academic freedom from\ncommercial and government interest.\n(4) No victim is ation for\nPolitical views.\nWe wonder if the National\nCommittee of Vice Chancellors and Principals (NCVCP)\nhas any coherent view of\nthese questions. We are sure\nthat even those who feel we\nare ' irresponsible' to ask\nthese questions would like\nto know the answers.\nIn the second part of the\nletter we ask Lord Penney\nto help solve the problem by\nusing his influences, which\nare considerable: N. C.V.C. P.; Sir Sidney Caine\n(ex L.S.E. Director) and Dr.\nWare (chairman of JURGO's recent subcommittee, who\nare both on the Governing\nBodies of I.C. and L.S.E.; Dr. Adams is alternatively\nchairman with Lord Penney\nof the joint I.C.L. S.E. committee on administration\ntechnology & economics;\nHouse of Lords; Industry.\nI.C. and L.S.E. are not as\nseparate as most people have\nbeen led to believe, neither\nare universities in general,\nindustry and the govern-ment, as was clearly demonstrated by Ted Short's bitter\nopinion clashes with the\npolicies of the admin is tra tion, we see the true power-structure.\nI.C. is very proud of its\nstaff-student relations, featuring countless committees\nwhere both sides get together\nand discuss matters REASONABLY. What if both\nsides reason differently ? The\nstudent-reps on J.U.R. G.O., for instance, may not be\nmandated on any line of\npolicy, and thus, as they\nmeet the Rector as isolated\nindividuals, personal pressure on them is inevitable.\nBut then, what if the Union\nwere to negotiate over something ? Negotiations only\nmean anything when the two\nparties command comparable\npower. The Rector is not\ngoing to grant anything\nagainst his own wishes and is\nusually only approached\nover changes that he would\nimplement anyway.\nCastrated politicos like\nPhilip Marshall recognise\nattack on student socialists.\nStudents stand or fall to-get her. Yours etc.,\nMatthew Duncan Jones\nChairman Soc.Soc.\nPiers Corbyn\nChairman I.C.P. A.G. this situation and its effect\non the awareness of most\nstudents, accept it as inevitable and contrive to make it\nall seem rather jolly.\nL.S.E. students, however,\nhave recently shown us the\nalternatives. They too,\neventually recognised the\nfutility of negotiations, but\ndid not just give up. They fell\nback upon their or dy strength : their numbers and\nthe level of their committee.\nWhether or not their demands are eventually satis-fie d, they have clearly\ndemonstrated the superiority\nof direct mass involvement\nover any other method of\npart ici pt ation, with regard to\nboth accurate representation\nand effectiveness.\nIt is clear then why mass\naction is so feared and\nslandered by those who control our environment and so\nmany of our attitudes. It is a direct challenge to their\npositions.\nD.E. Christopher (Maths 1)\nTraitor or Arbiter?\nSir,\nOriginally this letter was\nwritten two months ago, but\nwas never sent to Felix.\nIt was with a great deal of\ninterest and incredulity that\none read \" They tell me\n. . .\" by Les Ebdon, which\nappeared in Felix published\nthe 11th December.\nLet us agree that nobody\nshould be punished twice for\nthe same offence; this is a very old principle in English\nCommon Law. However,\nconsider a case of arson committed by a student within\nthe college. Local magistrates are very unpredictable.\nThe student may escape\nwith only a six months pro-bati on. What does the college do ? Should not it\nprotect the other students\nand administer a punish-ment. For example, restricting the student from handling\nexpensive equipment or anything hazardous to other\nstudents.\nAccording to I.C. Council,\nat that time, the College\nshould do nothing. The I.C. Council wish to put the\nprinciple of \"no double\npunishment\" into the I.C. code of discipline without\nany reservation. This is\nmuch too inflexible and may\nbe subject to abuse. Surely it\nwould be better to agree in\nprinciple to \"no double\npunishment\". but for the\nCollege to reserve the right,\nin certain cases, to safeguard the well-being of\nother students.\nAs an individual in a free\nsociety I demand the right to\nspeak freely. It is most unfortunate that Mr. Ebdon\nshould regard a free-speaking\nindividual as having \" sold-out\" to the I.C. Council\ndecision, particularly when\nthe individual concerned\nnever agreed with the original decision for the reasons\nstated.\nNow, two months later,\nthe I.C. Council has agreed\nto what a few have jokingly\ncalled \" The Hood Solution \". It is a great pity that\noriginally the voice of\nreason did not prevail and\nthat no-one showed any farsightedness into the matter.\nIt is also strange how one\nmay hold one view stead-fast ly, and be judged traitor\none day and arbiter the next\naccording to the whim of\npublic opinion.\nYours etc.,\nBarry Hood\n(Hon.

The\nmotion was amended to include a meeting to discuss\nthe subject before the referendum would be held.\nDermott Corr's basis for\nargument as oppose r of the\nmotion was that the working\nparty set up to discuss constitutional change had not\nyet progressed far enough to\nmake a referendum at the\npresent time anything more\nthan a waste of time, energy\nand money, and the second er of the motion said little\nexcept that the Union could\nbe no worse, so any change\nwould be for the better. John\nPerrins referred to the \"yes-no\" nature of the answers\nrequired by the referendum\nas being far too restricting for\nquestions which could result\nin fundamental changes to\nthe constitution; apart from\nthis he thought that the mass\nof IC students were too ill-informed for the results of\nthe referendum to be mean-ing ful. The President intervened to tell the meeting that\nthe arguments brought up\nby the proposer s of changes\nwould be printed in FELIX,\nwhich reached the majority\nof IC students. (In fact, a duplicated sheet should be\nfound inside.)\nThe motion was finally\ncarried by 181-144, and the\ndates of the discussion meeting and the referendum settled for Feb. 20th and 24th respectively. George Assimakis, Chris Parker, Chris\nKent, David Foster, and John\nPerrins were appointed as\nmembers of the working\nparty for the referendum.\nL.S.E. The second motion was\nproposed by Piers Corbyn,\nand was that ICU believes\nthat the problems of LSE\nshould be resolved by the\nstudents of LSE alone, and\nthat the school should only\nbe re-opened under the conditions decided upon at the\nlast meeting of 1500 stu-dents. Despite an unsuccessful attempt to move next\nbusiness by Mr. Olley and\nMr. Mackman, Mr. Corbyn\nmade an informative speech\nabout the school, putting the\nblame for its troubles on Dr.\nAdams and his action in putting up gates without any\nconsultation with staff or any\nwarning to students, also in\nhis supposed victim is ation of\nstaff sympathetic with stu-dents. He cited two examples\nof staff at LSE acting as informers to the police, and\naccused Dr. Adams of\nbelieving in double punish-ment.\nC.C. Parker began by\nspeaking against the motion\nbut later proposed an amendment to the motion, that the\nresolution to the problems of\nLSE should be based on\ntolerance. Tolerance did not\nmean apathy, he said, and\nspoke of \"agitating groups\"\nin LSE, reading some of their\nliterature to the meeting. Mr.\nCorbyn questioned the constitutional right of Mr.\nParker to attempt to change\nthe motion in such a drastic\nway in the middle of an\nopposition speech, but Rex\nLewin decided it was permissible, and called for a vote as\nto whether the amendment\ncould be accepted. After\nJeff Steer had caused utter\nconfusion by accidentally\nphrasing the motion in two\ncontradictory ways, and the\nresult of the vote misread, the\namendment was defeated.\nThe second er of the motion\npointed out that the students\nat LSE were back to the same\nposition as they were in the\ndays of Adelstein and Bloom,\nalthough he agreed that the\nstudents had taken direct\naction against the gates in\nthe wrong way. A move to a vote was carried, but 20\npeople present decided they\nwanted a ballot vote, which\nmet with disapproval from\nthe majority, but the standing orders upheld their right\nto do this. The problem was\nneatly sidestepped by suspending the standing orders\nwhilst a vote was held. The\nmotion was carried 190-159,\nand the orders reinstated.\nLes Ebdon making a point at the I.C.U. meeting.\nChallenge\nLes Ebdon stood to propose the motion that ICU\nrefuses to accept \"double\npunishment\" for students\nunder any circumstances, and\nmandates Council to open\nnegotiations with the Rector\nand bring the matter before\nthe Board of Governors\nbefore the end of term.\nBefore Ebdon could speak,\nthe traditional challenge to\nthe quorum was made\u2014the\ntime being 2.30 \u2014 but\nastoundingly the number of\npeople still present was 304.\nRob Collinge opposed the\nmotion on the practical\ngrounds that the Board of\nGovernors did not meet\nbefore the end of Term.\nBbdon then amended the\nmotion to overcome this\nobjection \u2014 for \"Term,\"\nread \" session \" \u2014 and after\nhis summing-up speech in\nwhich he disassociated himself from the militant opinions of his second er, the\nmotion was carried on a show of hands,\nmade over a wide range of\neducational and social expenditure it was not possible\nto justify the treatment of\nstudents as a special case.\n\"Despite this decision\nthere has been no falling off\nin the quest for university\nplaces. The student grant\nsystem in this country remains a generous one compared with the systems\nadopted in other countries\nand we believe it unlikely\nthat students will or have\nsuffered any serious hardship\nsolely as a consequence of\nthe decision.\"\nThe London Regional Organization of NUS are taking\naction on grants as well as\nIC, and the timing of the\npetition happily coincided\nwith the start of their grants\ncampaign.\nPhilip\nfor R.G. S. dinner\nThis year the Guest of\nHonour at the Annual Royal\nCollege of Science Dinner\nwill be H.R.H., the Duke of\nEdinburgh. The Dinner is to\nbe held in Southside on 14th May.\nA top-class Mooney is\nguaranteed and with the\nUnion subsidy the Dinner will\ncost 30/- per person. Out of\n300 places, 100 are allocated\nto guests and the reception\ncommittee and the remaining\n200 will be for sale. Tickets\nare by application form\nonly, either from the RCS\nBroadsheet or from forms\nto be distributed throughout\nthe Union. However it is\nrumoured that the Dinner is\nalready over subscribed and\npeople applying for tickets\nnow would be very lucky to\nget one.\nCulture at Guilds\nThe Guild's Union meeting on Tuesday 11th Feb.\nconcerned itself almost totally\nwith its Festival of Music\nand Culture. Chem. Eng.l won it with a skit containing\na budding young female im-person at or. In the aftermath of their\ncontroversial motion passed\na week or so before, Guilds\nseem the least concerned of\nall about it. No mention of\nit was made, except, perhaps,\nfor a few cries for P. Marshall himself to perform\nsomething. As he was one of\nthe judges of the Festival, his\nrefusal to do so can only be\ndeemed obvious.\n\n"

The Union is at present\non a very tight budget and has more important things to spend its money\non. In any case, what is the point of spending all this money when we\ncannot effectively get anything in return that we cannot get elsewhere?.\n5. The Case for a Sabbatical Year for the President of the Union\nWith academic work to do, it is highly impracticable for the\nPresident to be in touch with students. With no a cade s icc work, he would\nhave the time to go the rounds meeting his fellow students. Far from\nbeing a professional President, he could be in better contact with student\nopinion. Thus he would be far better able to act in the best interests of the majority. The President would have more time to devote to External Affairs, as well as Internal ones - External Affairs at this college tend to be\nrather neglected.\nAlso it is possible that with a sabbatical year we may get a third year or preP. G.( better) willing to take on the job. Of late the choice\nfor President has been limited, and there is not much point having a democratic election system if there is only one candidate.\nThe Case Against a Sabbatical Year for the President\nThe principle argue ment against a sabbatical year is that it is not\nat present necessary. This is true at I.C. and perhaps not so at other\ncolleges mainly because the Constituent College Presidents deal directly with the academic staff,a function which elsewhere might fall to the\nUnion President, in addition to his other duties. As a result of this, the job at present occupies about half of an average day.\nIf the President had a sabbatical year, then it weald be considerably\nmore difficult to appreciate some of the problems cf the average student,\nand so be a genuine representative. Also, one of the many functions of\nthe Union is to give students some experience of organisation. The\nmove to a sabbatical year could push almost all of this work onto one\nperson, whilst the present system allows the load to be spread over many\npeople and over a wider range of opinions. Finally, the establishment of a sabbatical year would be expensive\nto the Union, since the grant for the President's year of office would\nhave to come out of the Union income.\n6. Election of President and Secretary by a College ballot General The present system is that the president and secretary are\nelected by the joint incoming and outgoing members of council. The\ncandidates can be from the whole college. The proposal has been mooted\nthat the system be changed so that the election is by a ballot of the\nwhole college. This system is used at a number of colleges but little research has been done by I.C. to ascertain its effectiveness. It has\nalso been suggested that the President and Secretary should run for office in pairs of candidates.\nMerits of Proposed system The President and secretary represent the whole\ncollege and as such should have the full democratic backing of a majority\nof the college and not just council. Much of the apathy associated with\nisolated beau roc rac ies can be alleviated by the involvement of the whole\npeople in determining the future leaders.\ncontinued. .....\n\n"

    "content": "The Case for the Constituent College Unions\nConstituent College Unions have existed for approximately 70\nyears within the Imperial College Uniona Their original existance\nwas justified for the simple reason that the students wanted them to\nexist. There were far fewer students in Imperial College when it all started than there are now in either Guilds. R.C.S., or probably Minesbut for the sake of promoting inter college rivalry and developing\n' spirit' both sentiments heavily knocked by many these days - the\noriginal students wanted the constituent colleges to exist within I.C.U. As is obvious to all. the situation is very different now.\nWhether students as a whole still believe that, for the sake of rivalry and\nspirit alone, constituent colleges should exist, is now only a minor point. The most important consideration is the role the constituent colleges now\nhave to play within I.C.I. C.U. is now so large an institution that it is a major task to run\nit effectively and well - for the benefit of the students. In this context\nI believe the most important aspect of Unicn Administration to be the reallocation of the Union Grant in such a way as to enable as m ny individual students as possible to have a say in how their money is used. Constituent\nCollege Clubs, such as the Maths & Physics Soc., the Chem. Eng. Soc,. the\nMining and Metallurgical So c.,all have their respective grants controlled by the Constituent College Unions - relieving I.C.U. of the burden of this administration and enabling students in the relevant technological field.. to directly control the Society. There are many other societies and clubs in similar situations and\nto control them through Iv C., would necessitate the introduction of many\nmore committees or sub-committees, which would have to be chanelle d through\na central committee - probably Council. Tc me, this is to clutter up and\nconfuse the situation needlessly.. Within each Constituent College Union is an Academic Affairs Committee.\nThe benefit to the student of these committees has been proved ever since\ntheir introduction, net only by improved Staff/Student relationships, but\nalso, in many cases by improvements to particular courses as a result of\n_work done by the Committees. Trying to organise the same set up on an I.C. basis would, I believe, result in poorer communication between staff/students\nbecause the organisation would be too big and impersonal.\nConsidering the executive side of IX Administration, the present\nsystem not only works -- and despite what the knockers say, works well -but guarantees a permanent cross section of opinion on the Executive\nCommittee,\nOne final point about the Constituent Colleges - in addition to the\nfact that they have a great history they still add a tremendous amount\nof character to Imperial College - character which is the envy of most\nother London Colleges and frequently expressed as cynicism by them.\nThe Case against Constituent College Unions\nThe business the Constituent Colleges deal with can be divided into three main areas : -1. Entertainment i, organised ents,, balls, carnival smoking concerts etc. ii, carnival( rag) and other inter college rivalry( swimming gala).2. Clubs & Societies( sporting and academic)\n3. Academic Affairs continued.\n\n"

After their\ninitial teething troubles, and\nthe rumours that have been\ncirculating, it's time for\nsome facts to be provided.\nThe idea of buying up\nexisting houses to provide\naccommodation started some years ago, with the old\nSelkirk Hall which was at\n50, Holland Park. This was\nfollowed by the building of\nSouthside and Weeks, after\nwhich the old Selkirk Hall\nwas sold. However, as the\nmoney for providing accommodation in Halls of Residence dwindled, interest in\nhouses was re aroused. The\noriginal feasibility study was\ndone by Council and was\nbased on information gathered from Hull University,\nwhich has a system of Student Houses. Although the\ncapital outlay was higher in\nLondon than in Hull a significant saving was evident\nin respect to building Halls\nof Residence. The ideas\nwere put into practice in\n1967/68 and some houses\nwere acquired at Evelyn\nGardens, S.W.7. The finance\nfor conversion of the first\neight houses into two Student Houses was obtained,\nthe first being opened in\nOctober 1968 and the second\nin January 1969; by October 1969 it is hoped to have\na further three Houses, taking 360 students in all.\nIn contrast to the Halls of\nResidence, the Houses have\nto be self-supporting and\ncannot rely as heavily on\nCollege services, or the\nincome from Conferences to\nsub sid is e costs. However, by\nreducing the amount of\ncleaning provided it has\nbeen possible to keep rents\nlow in comparison with\nsimilar accommodation. Students are able to rent either\nsingle, double or treble\nrooms, the rents being \u00a33,\n\u00a32 10s., and \u00a32 and can\napply for the multiple rooms\nas a group. Each student is\nprovided with a chest .of\ndrawers, bureau, and shelves\nin a Ladderax unit, a coffee\ntable, a wardrobe, a bed, a working chair and an arm-chair. Residents are provided with linen and bedding\nwhich they have to launder\nthemselves. In each House\nthere are also communal\nkitchens with cookers and\nrefrigerators, a small lounge\nwith easy chairs and a tele-vision, and also a laundry\nwith an automatic washing\nmachine, drying and ironing\nfacilities.\nAlthough the Student\nHouses cannot provide all\nthe facilities which the Halls\nprovide, they are distinctly\ncheaper, better and nearer\nthan any other place in\nwhich students may live.\nMoreover besides their financial advantage, they have\nless obvious advantages such\nas no rents to pay over vacations or the soul destroying\nGRANTS PETITION\nThe grants petition which\nwas distributed to undergraduates by year reps last\nterm has finally been sent to\nthe Secretary of State for\nEducation and Science Mr.\nEdward Short.

Extraordinary Meeting last Tuesday lunch-time, held in the main Physics Lecture Theatre, was attended\nby over 200 students. The primary purpose of the meeting was\nto debate the motion that \"R.C.S. Union dissociates itself\nfrom the recent C and G motion (passed at the emergency\nmeeting of Friday, 31st January) and requests R.C.S. President\nto inform the press that C and G is not I.C.\" This motion was proposed by Martin Bland who went into\ndetails about iron gates and also about the misrepresentation\nof I.C. by the national newspapers. His oppose r, Pete Dolwin,\nhad not prepared a speech and didn't really say very much.\nThe second er for the opposition put the point a bit more\nclearly saying that if such a motion was carried, and the\nnational press heard about it, they would naturally assume\nthat R.C.S. was in support of the recent actions of L.S.E. At this point, Piers Corbyn decided to suggest an amendment to the motion; the amendment being that R.C.S. believes\nthat the solution to the problems of L.S.E. should be left in\nthe hands of the L.S.E. students' union. Various people voiced\ntheir opinion of the amendment (and of P. Corbyn as well),\nbut when it came to voting on whether or not the amendment\nshould be made, those in favour won by a large majority.\nThe first speaker for the amendment motion was an ex-L.S.E. student who claimed that L.S.E. students had been\nquite justified in their actions. The opposition maintained that\nwith the amendment the press would be even more likely to\nmisrepresent R.C.S.' s decisions if the motion was passed. Les\nEbdon attempted to speak about the \"militant apathy in C and G\" until it was discovered that he hadn't even been\npresent at the Guilds meeting in question and therefore didn't know what he was talking about. An R.C.S. student who had\nbeen at that meeting began to tell us the truth about the\nmeeting but in the face of repeated interruptions and the swift\npassage of time, he was unable to finish his speech.\nThe motion was then put to the vote and carried by 123\nvotes to 89 with 13 abstentions.\nThe second motion was to condemn the letter sent to Lord\nPenney a fortnight before. Jeff Warren, proposing the motion,\nclaimed that the letter was an insult to Lord Penney and that\nthe forty students concerned had had no right to make these\ndemands on behalf of the whole of the College. The only\nopposition came from Les Ebdon\u2014not surprisingly, as he\nhelped to write the letter.\nAs time rapidly ran out, his views including the one that\npeople should try and think about the real root of the pro b lem, the concept of a university, were disregarded and the\nmotion was carried on a show of hands.\nHard days for\nCarnival ahead\nTonight sees the first of\nImperial College's two concerts at the Albert Hall, when\nSpencer Davis tops the bill\nfor the Carnival Committee's hopeful big money-raise r. At\nthe time of writing, it seems\nthat tickets will still be available so, if you fancy a night-out, give carnival some much\nneeded support as well.\nMeanwhile, on the Ents front,\nthe continuing tale of their\nconcert goes on from strength\nto strength. The Crazy World\nof Arthur Brown are crying\nout of their commitments,\nincluding next Thursday's Ents concert. So who have\nEnts got instead\u2014none other\nthan one of their previous\nchoices: The Bonzo Dog\nBand. Since the tickets had\n'Bonzo Dog' printed on them\nbefore Ents got Arthur Brown\ninstead, the re-arrival of\nBonzo Dog is doubly fortuitous. On the financial side, Carnival is not doing too well at\nall. The last estimate for collections is \u00a31,365 and the\ncash from the Carnival Walk\nis being very slow in coming\nin. At the present rate of syphoning money from the\npublic, IC don't stand a chance of getting anything\nlike the \u00a312,000 that the\nNational Council for the Unmarried Mother and her\nChild need if they are to be\nsaved from financial collapse.\nWith exams coming up in the\nsummer term, the bulk of the\nmoney will have to be collected before Easter. Success\nmeans everybody pulling\ntheir fingers out in the remaining four weeks of term.\nPenney passes letter to Council\nCopy of the letter sent to\nRex Lowin, I.C. President, by\nthe Rector. This was sent to\nLowin on 3rd February.\nIt concerns, first, the\nmotion passed by Guild's Union on 31st January and,\nsecondly, the letter sent to\nLord Penney by P. Corbyn\non behalf of 40 I.C. students\non the 30th January, both as\nreported in the last issue of\nFelix.\nDear President,\nI enclose copies of two communications I received on\nFriday last. The first is a published statement of a series of\nresolutions passed by the City and Guilds Union. The second\nis a letter addressed to me and signed by Mr. Corbyn on\nbehalf of about 40 students.\nAs Rector, I am of course always available and very\npleased to discuss with a student any particular matter where\nhe or she is seeking my advice or help. The letter from Mr.\nCorbyn is a completely different kind of approach, where I am called on to give assurances on some hypothetical\nquestions and also to interfere in the affairs of another\nuniversity institution.\nI feel that to receive and answer group representations puts\nme in the position of acknowledging that the proper channels\nfor the communication and expression of student opinion\u2014\nnamely the Union can be by-passed.\nI should be grateful therefore if you and the Union Council\nwould consider Mr. Corbyn's letter and let me know if you\nwish on behalf of the Union to make any representations to\nme on the points he makes.\nYours sincerely,\nPenney.\nNews in brief\nIn an effort to play a part\nin improving staff - student\nrelations, Tizard Hall is \"at\nhome\" next Tuesday evening\nwhen residents are inviting\ntheir tutors and supervisors\nto a pun cli supper.

The three main\npoints are : double punish-ment, the powers of Wardens\nand bringing the name of the\nCollege into disrepute.\nIt was reported that\n\u00a3180,000 had been promised\nfor the College Appeal to\ndate, most from Banks, Insurance and the Stock Exchange.\nBarry Hood suggested that\n1C should have commercials\non TV.

Surman, a former RCM student, is the most gifted of\nthe group of young musicians from the West Country who,\nled by Mike Westbrook, have contributed enormously to the\nrobust artistic health of contemporary British jazz. He can\nbe heard playing many musical settings in London, his\nmusical personality remaining intact in the Humphrey\nLyttleton Band, the calypso-jazz group he leads with pianist\nRuss Hunderson, Mike Westbrook's concert band and sextet\nas well as the quartet which will be playing here.\nIn the quartet's co-leader, Mike Osborne, is to be found\nthe perfect complement to Surman's musical voice. Whereas\nSurman tends to play long, almost frenetic, solos, utilising\nhis incredible command of his instrument to play high above\nthe normal range of the baritone into that of the alto sax,\nbuilding to screaming climaxes but always remaining in full\ncontrol of the ebb and flow of tension, Osborne tends towards\nintroversion, producing almost bland alto lines in which\ntension is introduced by subtle shifting of accents. The\nDuring the last few months, several suggestions have been\nmade concerning the use of refectories by various sections of\nthe college community; academics, students, and other staff.\nCouncil has always been willing to open the present student\nrefectories to all other members of college, on the grounds\nthat we should do everything possible to help the mixing of\nstaff and students.\nHowever, at present the Senior Common Room does not\nappear to be so willing to open up some of its facilities. Perhaps the thought is that students, outnumbering staff by five\nto one, might overload these waitress service refectories. What\nno-one seems to have noticed is that if there really is such a large demand for this kind of meal then a refectory like this\nshould be opened for students too. In that case, there would\nappear to be no argument against de-segregating both\nrefectories . . . Q.E.D. Some people have expressed great surprise at the decision\nof council to ask for representation on the Development\nCommittee and so an explanation of the ideas involved may\nbe useful. In some high level committees, the membership\ninvolves reading several papers before the meeting and only\nbringing up at the meeting points you disagree with. These\ntend to be committees for approving new ideas, rather than\noriginating them. If you want to help set up new ideas, you\nhave to make your contribution at a lower level.\nThese lower levels often mean just informal contacts, but\nthey are usually more useful for advice, information and for\nworking your ideas into the system. At this college we have\nbuilt up a large informal structure, with the medical staff, refectory staff, registry, and so on. Sometimes student representation on full committees is desirable and sometimes it is\nunnecessary, creating nothing more than extra meetings to go\nto. In the case of the Development Committee, the feeling\nwas that co-operation was better than representation.\nR.J. Lowin\naddition of soprano sax to his armour y enabled Surman to\ncover the entire range of the four most common members of\nthe saxophone family with just two instruments and it is on\nthis instrument that his admiration for the work of the late\nJohn Coltrane is most apparent.\nThe quartet is completed by Harry Miller and Alan Jackson, a drummer who on tunes such as Surman's\" The\nTwist\" and \" Mrs. Brown \" does things with pop rhythms\nthat make Ginger Baker sound like Dave Clark.\nOn Wednesday, two blues groups provide the music for a party, again in the Upper re fec., with lots of jelly and trifle\nand lemonade\u2014or something. Clean up jazz's image and all\nthat crap.\nAnd so as the sun sets slowly in the west and RCS\nCarnival stops us using the Union on Friday, Jazz week\ncomes to an end on Thursday 27th with a film show including\nthe celebrated \" Jazz on a Summer's Day \"\u2014a film of the\n1956 Newport Jazz Festival featuring Duke Ellington,\nThelonious Monk, Chuck Berry, Mahalia Jackson and others\ntoo numerous to mention. Probably Tom and Jerry or Dudley\nMoore cartoons, too, we hope.\nSo there it is, five evenings of good clean fun with not a jelly-roll in sight. Come, for Christ's sake. Frenetic John Surman Courtesy Mallard Photographic\nAs a result of the recent bad weather, this week's sports coverage has been reduced.\nFirst XI smash Kings\nKings 0 I.C.4 Last Wednesday on a cold\nwet afternoon, I. C.1st XI visited Kings to play their\nfirst match for over a week.\nI.C. attacked fairly strongly\nin the opening minutes but\nKings seemed to gain control\nin midfield and with the college defence rather square at\ntimes it took two good saves\nfrom Davies in goal to prevent Kings scoring. In attack,\nhowever, I.C. were playing\nfluent football and opened\nthe scoring when a McCardle\nshot was deflected, rather\nluckily, into the net.\nIn the second half I.C. played a tight uncompromising game and gradually wore\ndown the home side's defensive formation. Following a cross from the left, Horlock\nwas able to score with a fine\nangled drive. After this the\nKings attacks were limited\nto breakaway s and it was\nonly a matter of time before\nI.C. scored again. The final\ntwo goals came from\nRichards, with a fine solo\neffort, and Conner who overlapped intelligently from his\nfull back position.\nThis is the first league\ngame of the season in which\nI.C. have not conceded a goal and as it is also the first\ntime in about four years that\nI.C. have defeated Kings in\nthe league it can be considered quite a good perform-ance. If the tight approach\nin defence had been found\nearlier I.C. would have had\na good chance of winning\nthe league.\nRunning out of steam\nA changeover scene in last Saturday's Hyde Park\nRelay in which race the I.C. team failed to start.\nThe winners were Borough Road college.\nMention was made in the\nlast issue of the forthcoming\nouting to Reading for the\nsenior half of the boat club\nand it is the turn in this\nissue of the novice section to\nreceive attention. These are\nthe oarsmen who began\nlearning to row from scratch\nat the beginning of the year\nand who will soon receive\ntheir initiation into regatta\ntype racing when crews from\nBedford come for a private\nfixture later this month. They\nhave progressed very well so\nfar and in the past few\nweeks have also begun to\nappreciate the subtleties of\ntraining on land as well as on\nthe water.\nOn Saturday 8th February\nthe 3rd crew raced in the\nColleges regatta organised\nby London Rowing Club in\nwhich crews from London,\nOxford and Cambridge colleges competed. There were\ntwo events, one for college\n1st VIIIs and the other for\njunior VIIIs, our crew being\nin the latter of these. This\nwas the first regatta experience for the 3rd crew as it\nnow stands and their race\nagainst the Middlesex and\nLondon Hospital crews was\nhard fought until the last\nminute, when they began to\n\" run out of steam \". London\nHospital won with Imperial\nCollege beating Middlesex\nby ^ length. The final of this\nevent was won by St.\nEdmund Hall, Oxford, who\nwere racing in an I.C. boat!\nG.W. Harrison\nPopularity of Squash\nThe popularity of Squash\nin the college has grown\nenormously since the opening of the squash courts and\nthis has led to the discovery\nof a number of useful\nplayers.\nThe first team achieved\nexcellent results in the first\ndivision of the University of\nLondon League by topping\nthe list with 42 points out of\na possible total of 54 at the\nend of last term. This was no\nmean achievement in the face\nof the high standard of competition in the field.\nThe second team have\nproduced very good results\nthis term. They narrowly\ndefeated the first team in\ntheir league match last week,\nthough admittedly the latter\nwere unable to field their\nstrongest side on that occ a sion. Nonetheless, credit must\nbe given to their fine performance and determination.\nThe highlight of the match\nwas the heroic stand of Chris\nSt. John (second team)\nagainst Stuart Cumming,\nwhich the former won after\na hard 5-game battle, playing\none of the finest and most\nconsistent games of his\ncareer.\nAt the present rate of\nprogress, the club can look\nforward to a very successful\nseason.\nM.
