    "content": "* FELIX\nTheatre A cyclic Irish history\nThe Non-Stop Connolly Cycle The Almost Free Theatre\nThe television pundits tell us that the\nmajority of people in this country are\nastonishingly politically ignorant -apparently only one person in five\ninterviewed on Brighton prom, last\nsummer could name the Foreign Secretary.\nThere is probably one thing above all others that Englishmen fail to understand\nand that is the Irish problem, something\nthat has been with us for over three\nhundred years.\nIt is in order to remedy this glaring\nfailure of education that Margaretta\nD 'Arcy and John Arden have written a series of fourteen plays, each one hour\nlong, entitled The Non-Stop Connolly\nCycle. The complete Cycle will be\nshown twice; the first began last Monday\nand the second starts on June 3rd, at\n1.15 at the almost Free Theatre in\nRupert Street, between Shaftesbury\nAvenue and Leicester Square. As is\nusual with Almost Free shows members\nof the audience pay as much as they feel\nthey can afford.\nThe Cycle tells the history of\nIreland from 1868 to 1916 through the\nlife story of one man, James Connolly, executed for his part in the Easter Rising of 1916. In the first part, which\nis the only one I have seen, Connolly\nreceives advice from his uncle, on the\nrun for his part in an abortive rebellion,\nand searches for work in a poverty-stricken Edinburgh, where no-one really\nwants to employ an Irish Catholic boy.\nAs a last resort he joins the Queen's army and, ironically, is sent to Ireland\nto put down disturbances caused by\npeasants being evicted by tyrant absentee\nlandlords, safe from any agitation in\ntheir Westminster strongholds. In Dublin\nhe meets a man promoting the works of\n'the two Germans' Marx and Engels, and\ndeserts to marry a young Protestant.\nFrom a study of the synopsis given I can tell you that the treatment of\nConnolly' s life is very detailed; so much\nso that a comprehensive understanding\nof the Irish Question can probably only\nbe gleaned by attendance at each of the\nfourteen plays. The political content of\nthe Cycle is undeniable; the synopsis of the final part states \" Connolly goes\ndown in history as the first working-class\nleader to enter the world struggle on a Socialist basis\". The plays contain both ballad songs\nand verse and are performed on four sides of the audience; the disembodied voices of the remote politicians in London coming\nfrom behind us. The performances lose\nnothing by being read and show a great\ndeal of commitment by the actors to\ntheir material. If you take a two-hour\nlunch break to see one of these plays you\nwill certainly not be wasting your time.\nI was sorry that I was not able to give\nmore space a fortnight ago to the Almost\nFree's previous production \u2014 Tom\nStoppard's two new plays, Dirty Linen\nand New-Found-Land. These are two\nplays in Stoppard's usual hilarious vein, with a first class cast. Because of their\nsuccess they have been transferred to\nthe Arts Theatre from June 16th. Performances will begin at 8.30pm, Mondays to\nThursdays, and at 7.00 to 9.00pm on\nFridays and Saturdays. Book your seats\nnow for a riotous evening.\nNext week I hope to be writing about\nthe Royal Shakespeare Company's production of Eugene O 'Neill's The\nIceman Cometh. Meanwhile news has\ncome from the Aldwych that until July 3rd the special student standby ticket\narrangement will operate from 10.00am. Turn up with your Union card and you can\nbuy any seat available for \u00a31 for that\nevening's performance, of either The\nZykovs or The Iceman Cometh.\nThomas Stevenson\nMusic It feels good and it is good\nGraver Washington JNR Feels So Good ( KUDU) YET ANOTHER jazz er moves into the\nrealms of cerebral funk and doing so with\ncharacteristic style. This is not a street band. It's a set of super-slick\nsession men who'd be as much at home\nplaying this infectious bump-hump\nstuff as avant garde improvisations,\nthough presumably a few more acker s can be found in supplying the punters\nwith product as palatable as this. Nota\nBene that \" Feels so Good\" reached\nwell into the American charts earlier this\nyear (wi d uh bull it!) The first point that breaches the\nsub con cio us is that Washington uses\nsome very ace drummers indeed, to wit\none Steve Gadd, he who hardly appears\nto connect with you hi-hat, thereby\ngiving the sound an especially crisp and urgent feel to it. This sharpness is\nhighlighted on \" The Sea Lion\", a substantial chunk of black power with\nplenty of that body-building fon keh st off, toned down by the relaxed free-flowing\nqualities of \"Moonstreams that follows.\nThis is achieved by Grover's gentle\nflute solo and the simple bass patterns\nof Louis Johnson (the great Alphonso\nperchance?).\nIt's around now that the effect of\nHerbie Hancock' s pioneering in the\njazz-funk field, from \" Headhunters\" days onwards, is being felt, with an\noutburst of accomplished jazz musicians\nreleasing albums like tins which are\norientated towards the younger disco audiences. \" Knucklehead\"( Track one,\nside Two, and no relation to the Bar-kays\nversion) is a good example of this,\nopening with a\" chameleon\" like\nbass/drums combination for the first\neight bars or so and gradually taking\nform with the addition of organ and\nWashington's sax runs. The rest of the\ntrack takes off from that foundation,\nsoaring guitar solos, the occasional orchestral intrusion et al, welded solid by the bass of Gary King. The standard\nof playing is as you'd expect from the\nlikes of Randy Brecker, providing his\nusual faultless trumpet and Flugelhorn\nblowing, and John James, subdued but\never-subtle on organ.\nThe title track provides another\nmammoth slab of rhythm-work, Washington\nmeandering and bellowing his way\nNow, this is a whole different bag\nof peanuts. This is a street band.\nPlaying various forms of what is no\ndoubt Southend type street music. What\nin all the heavens are a load of aviators\nfrom the p avil; on doing playing 'or rib le bluegrass, and country and western\nschmaltz. Things do start to liven up a bit towards the end of Side 1 though,\nwith the present single \" Cr u is in' for\nlove\" and \" Back to the book\"( mid-paced\nrockers?)\nWhereas Grover Washington and de\nboys try out the \" new\" sounds emanating\nfrom the black American music scene,\nthe kur saal s are very definitely a derivative band, sticking carefully to\nwhat's been done before, whether it\nbe the aforementioned Johnny Casherama\nor Harry Belafonte calypso-ing to the\nthrough the beat till Eric Gale's guitar\ntakes charge of matters and proceeds to\n\" do it's thing\" rather tastefully, all over\nthe little black plastic stuff. When\nall' s said and done, you get three\ntracks of brash, unashamedly high-concentration funk, one mid-tempo rou st by the name of \" Hydra\", and one\nmelodic, wispy, wallow, courtesy of\n\" Moon streams\", the whole effort mob ly compelled along by some superlative\ndrumming. This is not a street band. It\nis class. What do you mean you haven't bought\n\" The Last Record Album\" yet? Gor\nb lime y! strain of \" Palais de Danse\". They\nexude some slightly anaemic rockin' on\n\" Pain and Misery\", where Lead guitarist\nGraeme Douglas shows that he can whip\nit out now and again if his but ties depend on it, but Paul Shuttleworth's vocals don't amount to much, except on\nhis nifty version of \" yo' reggae pick-a dub rasta-Jah rass man\" on \" Hypochondriac\", the sole West Injun track\ndey do. Interesting lyrics to visa vis\" Elvis, com an' g it you been s, an' stop\nshoot in' op me calamine los hun n\". Ho-hum, back to a Babylon. This little ray of sunshine is followed,\nneedless to say, by more C and W drivel, by which time redemption has\nbeen lost anyway. Except for \" Hypochondriac\", a pretty ordinary LP really.\nHIC\nThe Kursaal Flyers - The Great Artiste (UK Records)\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nDEUS EX MACHINA??\nOr-Something nasty in the kitchen\nI PREFER NOT lo eat in Southside. In\nfact, whenever I have a choice I dine in\nthe Sherfield refectory or in the Union. But now that the Hot Pot has instigated\nsevere chip rationing (sliced carrots\nbeing a poor substitute) I frequently have\nto pay a visit to Southside to obtain my\nweek-end nourishment. But as Is aid,I would really prefer not to go there at all. You see, I like to eat with clean cutlery.\nI just don't want to have to eat dead\ncabbage, dried gravy, en cf us ted sheperd's pie/hamburger/mi need-beef-ro lI served with a splash of saliva au gratin.\nOr at very least I want the option of not\neating it. That's why I usually go to the\nUnion or Sherfield refectories - it's safer.\nNow this is no unfortunate slip-up. I 've\nbeen running regular risks of poisoning\nmyself over the last three years in\nSouthside. Many times have I brought this\npoor state of hygiene to the attention\nof the counter staff, but to no avail. That's fair enough - I expect that from\nSouthside. But what is more ominous is the\nresponse to my complaints \u2014 \"Sorry\nContinued from page 4\nthe life of the College, and long may it\ncontinue. It has given a welcome airing\nto neglected music \u2014 for example, the\ntwo Hoist suites played in recent concerts.\nOne hopes therefore that the members will foster the goodwill they undoubtedly have\nby closer attention to their performing\nstandards - they've done better before,\nand can do so again. It would be a sad\ncommentary on an original and entertaining experiment if it were to be thought\nof as no more than a poor joke.\nDavid Thomas\nluv, it's the Machine\",\" There' s nothing we can do - it's the Machine\",\" That' s how they come out of the\nMachine - but it does boil them\". What\nMachine? What is this Machine? Why\ncan't anything be done about the Machine?\nI protest that this is not good enough and\nam advised to fumble around in the\ncutlery until I find a recognisable knife.\nBut I don't want to do that either.\nCertainly I have no wish to consume\nthe decaying vegetation attached so\nfirmly to the knife, but neither do I want\nto eat other people's grime, grease,\nsweat and other unmentionable substances\nthat invariably find their way on to\nhuman hands. I just don't like eating\ndirt. Doesn't anybody realise this?\nNo, of course they don't, for they are\nall servants of the Machine. Mr Mooney is\na mere minion, a puppet refectory\nmanager firmly under the control of the\nMachine. The Southside staff have been\nreduced to minor automatons, the sole\npurpose of their miserable existance to\nprotect and defend the Machine at all costs. Even Pedro is worked by strings.\nThe Machine rules OK. There can be no doubt that the\nMachine is a threat to life as we know\nit. But what is its purpose? Why is it\nhere? Where did it come from? I believe\nthat even now it is directing an intensive\npropaganda campaign towards the similar,\nbut still docile, machines in the Union\nand Sherfield refectories. And if they\nsuccumb we are doomed - it is abundantly\nclear that the aim of the Machine is to\neradicate all human life at IC by slow, deliberate poisoning.\nAs if that's not bad enough, don't forget that the Machine is not a clever\nthing like a computer or a parking meter.\nI mean, it doesn't have anything remotely\nresembling a brain. No, for all its power\nthe Machine is a mere electromechanical\nmoron, doggedly following its mindless\ninstincts of destruction. We are up\nagainst the most powerful idiot the\nCollege has ever known. That is the\nfinal horror. You can't even outwit it,\nfor it has no wits.\nWhat are we to do? How long before\nthe last surviving IC student chokes on\na putrid pea and suffocates? How then\nwill the Machine satiate its thirst for\ndeath? Will it turn on Mooney? You bet.\nWhen he's finished his job he'll go the\nsame way as the rest of us. Probably\nstabbed in the throat with a septic\nfork.\nAnd then what? Have no illusions; having wiped out Imperial College it will turn to greater things. The day Mooney's giblets are bundled into the mince r will be Judgement Day for this planet. In\nkitchens all over the world, slumbering\ndish-washers will be awakening and\nrising to their ultimate task; their tinny\ncries of \" ulcerate!\" signalling the\neclipse of man and his world. There will be no escape. On that day, when the\nkitchen doors open, the world will see\nthe face of the Machine. But then it will be too late.\nWe must not panic. There is still time. The Machine has yet to entwine\nits tentacles around Sherfield and the\nUnion. Anna still gives you extra chips\nif you want them.

Kicking them while they're down\nABOUT THREE years ago a report in the\nGuardian revealed that British companies\nin South Africa were paying workers at\nrates below a poverty datum line. Some\noutcry followed, and one year later the\nGovernment responded by asking the\ncompanies involved to reform themselves\nor face legislation. Last week the\nSunday Times reported on what progress\nhad been made and concluded that 'Some\nBritish companies are still paying black\nworkers below subsistence levels. Most companies are paying below the\nminimum wage rate laid down by the\nBritish Government'. So what now? Will\nHMG legislate? I would be pleasantly\nsurprised if they did, but the omens are\nnot good. Less than two weeks ago in\nNairobi, the new Secretary of State for\nTrade, Edmund Dell, made a speech which\nwas less than propitious. It revealed\nthat in international economic policy\nBritain lies to the right of most of the\nEEC, and had even less to offer in\nthe way of new ideas than the USA. He was speaking at UNCTAD, the UN conference confronting basic problems of\nlarge-scale poverty in the Third World,\nincluding inter alia the role of multi- or\ntrans-national corporations. His emphasis\nwas on charity by the rich countries as\nthe key. Not justice, or even ordinary\ndecency in trade and investment matters\n(which is what the conference is about),\nbut the dropping of crumbs from tables\nmade replete in the first place by taking\nadvantage of the poverty and powerlessness such as that endured by black\npeople in South Africa. His words earned\nBritain a new nickname: \" The UNCTAD SNAIL OF Europe\". I am particularly incensed about such\nnews, partly because I was duped in\n1974 by the bland assurances of the\ncompanies I wrote to and the apparent\ndetermination of the Government, but also\nbecause I resent the hypocrisy of a Labour Government which would make\nthe poor carry the burdens of the rich. For even an unemployed person here is\nbetter off than some 800 million people\nin the worst of poverty abroad, and it is\ngravely misleading to try to tackle their\nproblems in isolation, or by aid programmes\nalone. It should not be forgotten that\nBritain depends on international trade\nfor half its food and three-quarters of its\nraw materials.\nSo what now? The power seems to lie\nwith the companies, but at least I can\ndecide to remember the worst of them and\navoid buying their goods or working for\nthem. When pushed on questions of\nmorality (a concept not found on balance\nsheets), they seem bedrock ed on the\nidea that if their shareholders make\nmoney then somehow the whole world is\nbetter off. Not me. My stomach can't take\nit any more. John Shade\nPlay it together, Don!\nVon Suppe: Light Cavalry overture;\nElgar: Pomp & Circumstance March No. 1;\nTchaikovsky: 1812 Overture.\nNo doubt as an attempt to end the\ndrought, the IC Wind Ensemble, whose\nactivities in the open air traditionally\nseem to attract rain, attempted to propitiate\nthe elements, but succeeded better in\nattracting the unwelcome attentions of\njet planes rather than those of Jupiter\nPl u vio us; the weather remained ob surat ely dry.\nHowever, in between successive passes by the agents of Pan Demon i um Airways, the Wind Band gave us its most\ntheatrical entertainment to date, not\nentirely to its own credit, commencing\nwith Von Suppe's Light Cavalry overture.\nThis piece, apparently written in memory\nof a third class trip on Austro-Hungarian\nRailways, has a lumpish nature calling for more bounce than the jog it got if it\nis to come off, so that its resemblance\nwas more to Milligan' s Underwater\nArtillery than to Light Cavalry. The\naudience, attracted by the wiles of\nadvance publicity, applauded politely\nand waited for the next number, the old\nwarhorse, Elgar' s Pomp & Circumstance\nMarch No. 1, so beloved of patriotic\nlisteners at Waterloo Station. After a flawed start when one of the participants\nkicked off before the whistle, it proceeded\nto a not much better middle and end, due\nmainly to ragged ensemble and lack of\nrehearsal, compounded by a lack of\naudience enthusiasm when they refused\nto sing the Land of Hope and Glory bit.\nPerhaps most of them didn't know the\nwords, or maybe it was a matter of\nprinciple.\nThese though were the B feature\nthat precedes the real thing, the moment\nwe've all been waiting for, which kept\nto the theme of militarism in the shape\nof Tchaikovsky' s1812 overture. For\nanyone who is unfamiliar with it (and\nthere must be a few), this is a rambling\nconcoction lacking in design which ropes\nin a diverse rag bag of material ranging\nfrom- Russian hymns and folk songs to\nla Marseillaise with almost Mahler-like\nabandon. The high spots of the performance\nlay in the special effects department \u2014\nexplosive in the case of Mr Shorter's mortars doubling for cannon-fire, electric ally detonated in dustbins half-way up\nthe Queen's Tower, giving the passing\naircraft something to think about. The\npolice were warned in advance. The\nUniversity of London Bellringers managed\nto extract some musical notes from the\nappalling peal, an achievement in marked\ncontrast to the customary leaden clank semen a ting from up there.The performance\nat ground level was something less of an\nachievement: missed notes are one thing,\nbut to be quite as far out of tune as\nsome of the conspirators were, and poor\nensemble, especially at the less-than-breakneck tempi adopted by Conductor\nMunro, are quite another. Most to blame\nwere the woodwinds, but the other\nblowers were not free of taint. The\nband seemed to rely on the spectacular\nto divert attention from the particular:\nfireworks off, though entertaining,\ndidn't make up for lack of attention to\ndetails. The Wind Ensemble's activities are\ninteresting and enjoyable contribution to\nContinued on page 5\n\n"

    "content": "FOUNDED IN 1949 NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nNo.420 Friday 2Tst May, 1976 FREE! Alternative Prospectus\nMatthews\nheads for\nBath\nPROFESSOR P.T. Matthews,\nthe physics HOD (Head of\nDepartment), is to become the\nnew Vice-Chancellor of Bath\nUniversity, it was announced\nlast week.\nProf Matthews came to IC\nin 1957, as a reader in the\nMathematics department, after\nspending some time in America\ndoing research. He followed\nthis with five years at\nBirmingham University as a lecturer.\nIn 1960 he moved to the\nBlackett Laboratory together\nwith Dr Salaam when it was\nfirst opened. He was made a professor in 1962.\nIt is almost certain that\nProf Bradley, FRS, will be\nappointed as Prof Matthews\nsuccessor when the Board of\nGovernors meet to choose the\nnew head. Prof Bradley is\nbeing recommended to the\nGovernors by the Rector after\nconsultation with the\nDepartment.\nCOPY DATE\n2pm Monday 24th in the balance\nTHE FUTURE of the Union's first alternative Prospectus\n(AP) hangs in the balance\nfollowing last Thursday's Admission Policy Committee\nmeeting: Members of the\nCommittee were angry that a final draft of the AP had\nnot been presented to them\nprior to being sent off for\nprinting'.\nThe Chairman of the\nCommittee, Prof Wood, did however receive a copy of\nA Pin its final form before\nprinting commenced. He returned the copy to the\nUnion with various comments.\nThe Union, after careful\nconsideration decided to allow printing to begin. Before the meeting, Rick Parker, ICU A AO, in charge\nof producing the AP, received\na communication informing\nhim that all\" responsibility, legal and otherwise\", for the\nProspectus was his. Rick Parker\nThe letter from Mr Go och, Senior Assistant Registrar,\nnoted that although the\ndocument as a whole was commendable, it was \"marred\nby the odd remark which is unfair, unnecessary, and may\nbe damaging to the College\". It was around this statement\nand one or two una c curacies contained in departmental\nsubmissions that the debates\ncentred.\nGlenda Jackson on STOIC\nMs GLENDA JACKSON, star\nof two Morecambe and Wise\nChristmas Shows, gave an\ninterview to Mark Caldwell, STOIC'S incumbent Chairman,'\nlast week. Ms Jackson, who\nhas received 40 film awards to\ndate, talked with Mark for\nal mort half an hour in front of\na small audience of STOIC and\nFELIX staff.\nThe interview was, Mark\nsaid to FELIX afterwards,\n\"One of the most rewarding I have ever done,\" and indeed,\nflowed smoothly throughout.\nExcept, that is, when a gel nearly fell of a spotlight.\nMs Jackson's humour was ever\npresent, and although it will not be shown on STOIC, she\nsaid that working with Eric and Ernie was, to her, \"a paid holiday,\" Just after\nreceiving her second Oscar, for her part in\" A Touch of\nClass\", amidst the many'\ntelegrams of congratulation\nshe turned up saying quite\nsimply \"Stick with us, we'll\nget you a third \u2014 En'c and\nErnie.\"\nThat showed class \u2014 more\nthan just a touch.\nAt the end of the debate,\nwhich lasted nearly 1% hours,\nthe Committee approved a draft document which has now\nbeen sent to the Rector. The document states the view that\nthere are unacceptable errors\nin the Prospectus which the\nCommittee might have asked the Union to change had this\nbeen possible. Some members of the\nCommittee expressed the view that the Alternative Prospectus should not be sent out with the\nCollege Prospectus. It was felt\nthat if funds and time were\navailable then corrections\nshould be made and the\nProspectus sent out separately.\nThe postage cost alone, in this case, would be well over\n\u00a360C.. The budget allowed for\nthe Prospectus is \u00a31100. This compares with over three times\nthis amount which Manchester\nUniversity spend on their AP. The Prospectus is at\npresent almost printed but has\nnot been bound. Printing has now been halted to await the\nRector's decision once he has\nconsidered the situation. He\nis expected to make his view known early next week.\n\"It is unfortunate that the\nsystem set up to oversee this\nproject did not function as\nefficiently as one would have\nliked. There are, inevitably,\nproblems with any new venture\nand one must be careful not to\noverreact\", Mr Parker said yesterday.\n\"If the yardstick applied\nto the APis applied to the\nCollege Prospectus, then it\ntoo can be found to contain\nitems which are either factually\nincorrect or misleading\", he\nadded.\n\n"

LETTERS\nIt's all at the bar\nSir, \u2014 a reply is needed to such\na well worded article as that\nby Stephen Humby entitled\n\" Smug, Uncritical IC\". The motivation for writing\nsuch a searing article about\nthe regimentation and mindless ness of the academic systems\nat IC lies deeper than is readily\napparent from a first reading.\nMr Humby's real discontent,\nI think, lies with the lack of\nany stimulating social life at\nIC. His article gives the\nimpression of someone who is\nnot satisfied with his work and\ndepressed at not making any\nprogress. A process which\nmakes one less willing to\nwork.\nThe impression is also given of one who has no\nsocial outlets from the boredom\nof the IC system. Something\nmost here have or perhaps are\nstill putting up with. There is one small way to\nget on top of your work (not\nsitting on it). That is to\nsuccessfully solve the problems\na little at a time. Success gives one confidence and incentive\nto get on with more work. So\ndo not tackle anything you\ncannot handle.\nAs for the social side; a great many people come to\nuniversity as a sort of \" Mecca\", believing in the myth of\n\" University life\". It does\nexist, but you have to go full\nout to get it. Do not hold\nback. Do not expect it to\nenvelop you in a mystical\nof Euphoria.\nA good way of meeting\npeople in IC is through the\nCC U's and ICU. The CC U's have, admittedly, an image of\nbeer swilling rowdies. Some of\nthe activities are moronic, but\nharmless and good fun. The\nCC U's do other more\nconstructive things directly\n(and indirectly) through their\n<7F Only:.\nReputation, what\nreputation?\nFOR SOME OBSCURE reason\nIF seems to have a reputation\nat IC, that is, among the elite\ncontingent who know what IF\nis. (Those who know where it\nis are even fewer and further\nbetween). They seem all to\nkeen to tell you that IF has a reputation, however, they never\nactually get round to telling\nyou what it is. Two weeks ago I was\nsitting on a stool in the middle\nof the Union Bar, drinking my\npint of lemonade and lime,\ninter lo cut ing with an individual\nwho shall here remain nameless, as they say (I was talking to\nhim too). When the conversation\ngot to a stagnant point, we\nturned to the can't think-of-anything-else-to-say question,\nwhich in the sixth form used\nto be \"What ' A' levels are you\ndoing?\" and has now upgraded\nto \" Well, what exactly do you\ndo at College?\" When I said\nthat I was at IF his face fell\nand there was an on imo us silence, or even an ominous\none. He looked me down and\nup, and down and up again,\nand said in a somewhat stunned\nvoice\" You' re at IF ... and\nyou're normal?\" Humph thought\nI. As far as I could remember\nno-one at IF has green saliva, or talons, or hairs on the palms\nof their hands (see \" All there\nis to know about Adolf\nEichmann\" by Leonard Cohen).\nPerhaps this kind gentleman\nmeant that I was normal as\nopposed to worse, and that\nmost people are worse as\nopposed to normal. I inquired\nfurther, agog to find out at last\nany details of our elusive reputation. But I was to be\ndisappointed once more.\nThere was as killed change of\nsubject which even I with my\ninfallible tongue/brain/tongue\ncould not combat. No doubt any\ncorrespondence solving the\nmatter will eventually find\nits way to the IF Union if sent\nto the FELIX Office.\nJane Turner\nTampax machines\nSir, - Is the IC Socialist Society so depraved of subjects\nfor mass debate that topics\nwith sexual connotations\nshould again be discussed? In a letter from Mr Teague\n(mandated by ICU council)\nthe Hall Committee was asked\nto discuss the potential\nprovision of Contraceptive\nand Tampax vending machines\nin the Hall. We wonder at the\nactivities( strenuous or\notherwise) of ICU Council if\nthey should consider a subject\nof such paramount impotence\nwith such gravity and at such\na length. During the period of\ndiscussions on this topic\ncertain points were hammered\nhome. For instance, people\npoked fun at the idea of these\nmachines being screwed on the\nwall, and where the things\nshould be put.\nWe also felt that the\npotential volume of trade in\nour Hall would not justify a Tampax machine (being an all male HalII.\nConcerning the other type\nof machine we feel it fitting\nthat all Union members should\nbe within easy reach of it.\nBut, if the Union would consider issuing such devices in\nsufficient quantity, size and at\ndeflated prices, then we\nwould be pleased to distribute\nthem. After all, in such hard\ntimes if s often difficult to\nmake ends meet.\nWe hope this letter will stimulate further res po^^e. Yours faithfully,\nSome Members of Garden Hall\nsocieties. There is more to\nsay about this but not here or\nnow.\nWhatever you do do not\nfester amongst useless work\nsheets. Go down to the bar at\nten o 'clock after working and\nrelax. You do not have to drink\na lot. There are a great deal of\npeople with amusing and\nintelligent conversation around.\nIf you live out, work in the\nlibraries, (you will probably\nget more work done), then go\ndown to the bar. On the whole,\nstay in College, as much\nas you can, there is more\nhappening than you can see\nfrom the outside. As they say\n\"How do you know you don't like it, if you haven't tried it.\"\nYours faithfully\nC.G. MILLER Physics I "

    "content": "8\nmix Refectory and Residence\ncharges up\nFOLLOWING A meeting on\nWednesday with the Chairmen\nof both the Refectory and\nStudent Residence Committees\nand the President of IC Union,\nthe Rector has decided to\nrecommend to the Finance and\nExecutive Committees of the\nGoverning Body that Hall and\nHouse Rents be increased by\n33% for the coming session\nand that Refectory Prices be\nincreased by 10%. The College\nhas an accumulated deficit on\nits Refectory and Residence\naccounts of about \u00a3200,000,\nand the Rector will ask the\nGovenors to write off, this\ndeficit.\nIt is however, not possible to write off deficits indefinitely\nand the Rector is concerned\nwith showing the Governors\nthat a concerted effort is being\nmade to make the accounts\nbalance in the coming year.\nThe increase of 33% on\npresent Hall and House rents\nwill, if approved . by the\nGovenors, be implemented at\nthe start of the coming session rather than on August 1st. This will allow those postgraduates\nremaining in Hall and House\nto occupy their rooms at the\npresent level of rents throughout the summer vacation. Recommended rents\nfor next session Southside, L instead, Weeks and\nNr ew Be it \u00a39.60 per week\nSingle rooms in Garden Hall, Student House and Old Be it \u00a38.30 per week.\nDouble rooms in Student Houses\nand Garden Hall \u00a36.70 per week\nTriple rooms in Student Houses\n\u00a36.15 per week.\nThe Rector is disappointed\nthat no concrete progress had\nbeen made to cut down the\nlevel of cleaning in the Halls. The Govenors had requested\nthat this problem be tackled\" urgently\" when they reviewed\nthe rents at Christmas. A cut\nin cleaning costs would be\ndirectly reflected in a smaller\nincrease in Student rents. However, the Cleaners' Union, N UP E, has rejected proposals\nto cut the number of cleaners\nor to reduce the hours of\nthe present cleaners.\nIt is hoped that the\nrelatively small increase in\nRefectory Prices will not\nresult in a reduction in customers in the coming year.\nThe Catering Manager will have\nthe ability to increase the\nprice of some items if their\ncost price increases exception-ally. Any alterations will have\nto be authorised by the\nDomestic Secretary and the\nChairman of the Refectory\nCommittee.\nAll the charges outlined\nabove will be for the first\nterm of next session the\nRector feels it in seri table with the present changing\nrate of inflation that they will have to be reviewed termly.\nApology\nFELIX would like to apologise\nfor the inconvenience caused\nto the Union Bookshop and its\nstaff as a result of the \"review\"\nof the book \"The Great\nLiterary Hoax\", published in\nlast week's issue of FELIX. This book does not in fact\nexist and we also apologise\nfor misleading readers into\nbelieving otherwise. The\narticle was purely fictitious\nand we would ask readers\nnot to pursue a fruitless\nsearch for this book.\nNew IC boat\nlaunched\nA boat designed by\nProfessor Cameron and\nmembers of the IC Aeronautics\nDepartment, the Monocoque\nsuper IV, was launched at\nPutney yesterday. Watched by\nPress and Television reporters\nthe boat was christened and\nlater taken out on the Thames. The revolutionary design is\nsaid to be worth five seconds\nover an Olympic course.

It\nis believed Johnfwho incident ly is only the fifth person to\nreceive the honour) was made\na life member for his outstanding contribution to the\nprosperity of the Penthouse\nClub.\nDuring the evening John,\ntogether with his escort for\nthe night, top model Felicity\nDerbyshire, ran up a bill\ntotalling \u00a3115 paid on this\noccasion, of course by the\nmanagement. When asked how\nhe could afford to frequent\nsuch an expensive club on\nmost nights of the week (a pint of lager costs 80p) while\nMving on a student grant,\nMcCloskey replied in no\nuncertain terms that we should\nmind our own business.\nHowever, it is believed\nJohn's interest in horse racing\naccounts for much of his\nfinances, together with a healthy chicken breeding\nbusiness at his home in\nKilburn.
