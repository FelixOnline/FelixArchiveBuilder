He knew that,\nshort of an enormous defeat\nagainst Reading, Imperial\nwere assured of their second\nleague win in as many years.\nHowever, with the Varsity\nmatch looming large on the\nhorizon, he also knew that\nany match practice was invaluable and so welcomed the\nopportunity of a final, albeit\nvirtually meaningless, BUSA\nmatch against Reading.\nImperial were buoyed by an\nexcellent and sociable coach\njourney on one of the premier members of the Golden\nTellings fleet. They also\nenjoyed an excellent warm-up in the idyllic surroundings of Reading\u2019s leafy and\nfemale-dominated campus.\nThe Reading players, looking resplendent in brand new\nkits, were hoping to claim\na hefty scalp and cement\ntheir team\u2019s position as the\nleague\u2019s second best team.\nThe game began and\nImperial were quick to rubber stamp their mark on the\nmatch,excitingthecrowdwith\nthe fast free-flowing rugby\nwhich they have come to be\nknow for. After an exchange\nof early penalties, Imperial\nsmoothly moved into a higher\ngear and following a period\nof pressure it was, inevitably,\nAchi who powered through a\nhapless defence to score the\nfirst try.\nThe gasoline was continually supplied to Imperial\u2019s revving engine, and the scoring\ndid not stop there. The versatile James Pedder sniped\naround the edge of ruck and\nrounded off another superb\nmulti-phase move with a fine\ntry.\nThe best try of all was\nscored by the enigmatic Jon\nSpencer. He, Alex O\u2019Rourke\nand Gabriel showed magnificent hands on a swashbuckling blind side move, with Jon\nscoring superbly past a bewildered and dizzied Reading\ndefence. The awe-struck\ncrowd, fully aware of the\nskill they had just witnessed,\napplauded loudly.\nThe second half was a somewhat messy affair, indeed in\npatches it was as scrappy as\nScooby Doo\u2019s minature side-kick. Reading were far more\nphysical in the last half and\ndid their utmost to make it\ndifficult for Imperial. Their\ndefence was breached, how-ever, as the impish Gabriel\n(only the second shortest\nman on the pitch) finished\nanother end-to-end move\nin the corner. The Imperial\ndefence held firm and the\nmatch ended four tries to nil\nto Imperial. The team was\njubilant to have secured the\nleague and enjoyed the opportunity to practise some new\nmoves, with varying success.\nNotable appearances were\nmade by captain Michael\nHicks and Gabriel, playing\nin his preferred position of\nfull-back. Other appearances\nwere made by old maestro\nRobinson, exciting young\nSerbian sensation Jovan,\nand by a young man whose\nImperial career is proving as\nbright as the Blackpool illuminations he loves so much\n\u2013 Steve.\nRUGBY\nRugby Firsts are league\nchampions again\nSponsored by\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 18\nUCL Men\u2019s 1st 5\nBy Michael Hicks\nAfter winning our league for\nthe second year running,\nthe Imperial College Union\nRugby Club First XV faced\nUCL in the Gutteridge Cup\nsemi-finals. Having won the\ntournament last year and\nbeing in good form, we set\noff confidently to our opposition\u2019s ground. On arrival,\nwe found ourselves facing a\ngale and some pretty heavy\nrain. This, along with kick-off\nbeing 20 minutes later than\nplanned, hampered our pre-match preparation.\nWhen we finally kicked off,\nwe came under some good\npressure from UCL and knew\nwe were in for a tough game.\nLuckily, we woke up fairly\nquickly and started playing\nsome good rugby. We got our\nfirst reward after ten minutes\nwhen good hands down the\nline found Al Newman on the\nwing. When he got wrapped\nup, a great supporting run\nfrom Steve McClellen allowed\nhim to take the ball on and\naround their arriving cover\nto score in the corner. Jon\nSpencer then converted to\nmake it 7-0 to Imperial.\nUnfortunately, UCL came\nback quickly and a simple\noverlap allowed them to score\nout wide. They missed the\nconversion into the wind and\nthe score was 7-5.\nWe then began to assert\nourselves and after some broken play close to the UCL\ntry line, Robinson drew the\ndefence, allowing Pedder to\ndart through and touch down.\n12-5.\nIn the second half there\nwere no more tries, but\ninstead plenty of penalties as\nUCL\n\u2019s discipline very noticeably started to slip. Man of the\nmatch Jon Spencer kicked\nsuperbly and added another\nsix points to our tally to make\nit 18-5 after 80 minutes.\nWe now face our toughest\ngames of the season with the\nannual varsity match against\nthe medics, a play-off for promotion and the Gutteridge\nCup final where, if we retain\nthe trophy, we will achieve the\nleague and cup double!\nRUGBY\nFirsts make\nCup final\nChampions: the Imperial Firsts rugby team in action\n\n"

It has connections with such pursuits as\nmagic, balloon modelling and\ngymnastics. Other connections may seem less obvious,\nand this brings me neatly\nonto the subject of today\u2019s\narticle: whip cracking.\nCome on, admit it. Who\nhasn\u2019t wanted to be (or be\nwith) Indiana Jones at some\npoint? Armed with a proper\nleather bullwhip, the skilled\nwhip-cracker can put out\ncandles without touching the\ncandle itself, split an A5 sheet\nof newspaper in half without\nthe person holding it feeling\nanything, and, of course, grab\nbeer bottles and pull them\nacross the room. Dodging\ngiant balls of stone and combating Nazi archaeologists\nare optional extras.\nThe first thing to do is\nchoose your whip carefully\n\u2013 a badly made whip will be\nboth hard to crack and more\nlikely to hurt you. A leather\nbullwhip about 10ft long is\nan ideal starting point. Run\nit along the ground behind\nyou in a straight line [see picture 1]. If it isn\u2019t straight, it\u2019s\ngoing to wrap around your leg\non the way past and possibly\neven perform an impromptu\ncastration.\nMake sure there are no poor\nsods within whipping dis-tance, and ideally nobody for\nquite some distance in front\nof you \u2013 the whip is capable\nof picking up small bits of grit\nand propelling them at Mach\n2 or above, which is cool in a\ngeeky kind of way, if a little\npainful for the recipient.\nSwing the whip forwards so\nthat it rotates up and finally\ndrops behind you [see picture\n2].\nOnce the whip is behind\nyou, bring your arm forward\nin a smooth motion to put a\nloop in the whip [see picture\n3]. This loop is the bit that\nactually gives you a big crack.\nIt accelerates down the whip,\nand once it passes through\nthe sound barrier a crack is\nheard. The important thing\nto note is that a big crack\ndoesn\u2019t take strength, it takes\ngood technique. Putting a\ngood loop in the whip is far\nmore important than flinging\nit around [see picture 4].\nOK, that\u2019s all there is to it.\nSince we are at a science and\ntechnology college though,\nhere\u2019s the science:\nWhat makes a whip crack\n\u2013 it\u2019s the tip creating a sonic\nboom, right? Not quite.\nProfessor Alain Goriely from\nthe University of Arizona\nperformed some theoretical modelling in 2002, which\nshowed that it isn\u2019t the tip\nbreaking the sound barrier\nthat causes the crack, rather\nit is the loop. Measurements\nhave put the accelerations at\nthe tip during a crack at well\nover 50,000G, which is why\nthe tip can do so much dam-age. Anyone who hits themselves during practice will be\nable to testify to this.\nWell, there you have it\n\u2013 another strange juggling-associated art demystified. As\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware by now,\nImperial\u2019s Juggling Society\nmeets on Tuesday evenings\nfrom 6pm. Email juggling@ic.\nac.uk for more details.\nJUGGLING CLUB\nTen things I can do that you can\u2019t\nEPISODE FOUR: The Whip\n1. Choose your whip carefully. Run it along the ground in a straight line. 2. Swing the whip forwards so that it rotates up\nand finally drops behind you. 3. Bring your arm forward smoothly to put a loop in the whip. 4.

Isn\u2019t\nthat a lovely tale to warm the\ncockles of your heart? No?\nYou\u2019re not alone.\nThe news was met, over-all, by indifference from most\nof the nation, although some\nof the newspapers went\na bit overboard. The Daily\nMail and The Daily Express\nwent all-out as if this were\na proper royal wedding (the\n\u201clove affair of the century\u201d?)\nand not a second-time-round\nevent for the couple who so\ncruelly cheated on Diana.\nIn fact, most commentators,\nleft and right wing, monarchist and republican, had an\nattitude of \u201cat bloody last\u201d. As\nThe Daily Telegraph put it: \u201cIt\nhas always seemed strange\nthat the country preferred a\nprince living in sin with his\nlover to a formal marriage...\nit was so furtive and teenage,\nit made him look adolescent.\u201d\nThe length of the relationship\n\u2013 the couple met at a polo\nmatch in the seventies, long\nbefore Charles met Diana \u2013\nwas frequently mentioned, as\nwas the \u2018Squidgygate\u2019 series\nof hideously embarrassing\nphone calls between the pair\nwhich were recorded in 1992.\nWilliam and Harry were\nsaid to be delighted, as was\nthe Queen. Lovely. So why\nthe dissent? Well, the monarchists are worried about\nwhether Camilla will become\nQueen or not. Call me stupid,\nbut I had always thought that\nhaving a monarchy meant\nthat you cannot choose who\nthey are. You put up with what\nyou are given. In any case, the\nchoice of title was a tricky one\nthat has ended with her being\nthe Duchess of Cornwall and\neventually the meaningless\nbut fancy \u2018Princess Consort\u2019.\nIn other words, she will be to\nCharles what Albert was to\nVictoria.\nSome of us were already\ngroaning at the thought of the\noverwhelming news coverage\nthat will lead up to the wed-ding. If you are too, I advise\nyou to read the republican\npress, namely The Guardian,\nwhich is hilarious: \u201cTripe,\ntosh and trivia will dominate\nthe press... there will be royal\nschmaltz by the bucketload.\nAnd there will be faux moral-ising of hideous proportions,\nthen there will be absurd\nconstitutional folderols about\nprotocol and religion. This will\nbe treated as if it were Henry\nVIII all over again \u2013 history\nrepeated as farce.\u201d\nI also advise a look at the\nmessage boards on the BBC\nwebsite, which are full of wonderfully furious messages\nfrom Americans, who seem to\nhave nominated themselves\nprotectors of Diana on Earth.\nTo everyone who actually\nenjoys these things, congrat-ulations, and please, please\nmake it a bank holiday.\nCharles and Camilla\nA romantic, heartwarming tale?\nBy Dave Edwards\nEditor\nOn Friday, members of the\n\u2018ImperialagainstImperialism\u2019\ngroup hung a huge anti-war\nbanner over the balcony of the\nelectrical engineering library,\noverlooking the main walkway of the South Kensington\ncampus.\nThe group took the action\nin protest against, in their\nwords, \u201cthe unjust and illegal invasion and occupation\nof Iraq\u201d. They left the balcony after 45 minutes and\nthen demonstrated around\nthe campus, where they were\njoined by other students.\nThe banner bore the slogan:\n\u201cNo more lies, no more war\u201d.\nAlso written on it were the\nwords: \u201cDemonstrate March\n19th, central London\u201d, a reference to the international\nanti-war demonstration taking place on that day.\nOne protester, Petros\nWallden, told Felix: \u201cI believe\nthat university is about educating people as citizens and\nnot only as scientists. Matters\nof foreign policy, such as the\noccupation, do concern the\nstudents, and as students\nthey want to protest.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWhen [College]\nSecurity got serious, we dismantled the banner and left\npeacefully.\u201d Members of \u2018Imperial Against Imperialism\u2019 make their feelings known to the rest of the College\nStudents protest against\nIraq occupation with\nmassive anti-war banner\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 17 February 2005 21\nTerminal illness movies always set\nout to be life-affirming, but few actually earn their uplifting conclusions\nas this Spanish biopic does.\nThe film is the fact-based story of\nRam\u00f3n Sampedro (Javier Bardem),\na virile seaman who was severely\ninjured in a diving accident in the\nlate sixties and bedridden thereaf-ter, unable to move from the neck\ndown. He has a poet\u2019s soul and is\ndeeply sensitive, yet he has allowed\nhimself to become bitter over his\nsituation. He is convinced that \u201ca\nlife in this condition has no dignity\u201d\nand battles the courts for the right to\nkill himself.\nSince the accident, he has lived in\nhis family\u2019s house, with his quietly\nbrooding father Joaquin, his grumpy\nolder brother Jos\u00e9, his anxious sis-ter-in-law Manuela, and their slightly dim-witted teenage son Javier.\nJos\u00e9 considers it his duty to provide for his incapacitated brother,\nand Manuela cares for him with a\ndevotion tinged by hints of romantic\naffection; Javier, meanwhile, looks\nupon his uncle as a second father.\nRam\u00f3n has no dignity in the current\narrangement, no zest for life. He\nwants to die.\nThrough the help of a group called\nDeath with Dignity, he secures the\nservices of Julia (Bel\u00e9n Rueda),\na lawyer herself suffering from a\ndegenerative disease, to prepare for\nhis court presentation. The notoriety\nthe case achieves attracts the notice\nof Rosa (Lola Duenas), a single\nmother who comes to visit him, and\na quadriplegic priest, who comes to\nthe house to dissuade Ramon from\nhis goal. This is given a humorous\ntouch by the presence of a couple\nof hapless seminarians, who must\ncarry their messages up and down\nthe stairs of the family house.\nUltimately, this isn\u2019t a film about\ndeath, but about life. Tortured\nby missing the freedom he once\nenjoyed, Ram\u00f3n is plagued by visions\nof his past. It\u2019s here that director\nAmen\u00e1bar excels. His direction is\ngraceful throughout, but never more\nso than in one beautiful scene where\nRam\u00f3n imagines swooping out of his\nbedroom window, soaring over the\nSpanish countryside and landing on\na beach where Julia is waiting to kiss\nhim, all accompanied by Puccini\u2019s\nNessun Dorma. The poignant story\nsubtly reminds us how fortunate we\nare to be able to choose life.\nThanks to sensitive writing by\nAmen\u00e1bar, a truly remarkable performance from Bardem and excellent support from the rest of the\ncast, the picture rises above its\ngeneric roots to emerge as a powerful human drama.\nIt\u2019s entirely credible that Ram\u00f3n\nshould be the focus of romantic\nattraction (and understated rivalry)\non the part of all three women in\nhis life, who, in the excellently varied performances of Rueda, Duenas\nand Rivera, effectively represent the\ndifferent possible reactions toward\nRam\u00f3n\u2019s desire to die. What makes\nThe Sea Inside such a riveting\ndrama is that none of these relationships is sufficient to make Ram\u00f3n\nwant to go on living. It is probably\nthe most uplifting, life-affirming film\nabout suicide ever made. He\u2019s such\na wonderful, honest man that you\nreally hope he dies at the end.\nThe Sea Inside takes on a topical\nissue, and gives no answers except\nthat which is entirely specific to\nRam\u00f3n:thismanhasclearlyweighed\nup life and death carefully and chosen the latter. Valid arguments are\npresented against his choice \u2013 his\nfamily, who adore him, don\u2019t want\nto lose him, and a priest notes that\n\u201clife isn\u2019t just moving your arms and\nrunning around.\u201d But Ram\u00f3n hasn\u2019t\ntaken this decision lightly. At night,\nhe weeps, asking himself: \u201cWhy do I\nwant to die?\u201d\nThis is one man\u2019s story, told with\ngreat empathy, and Amen\u00e1bar\ndeserves great credit for lifting the\nfilm above the tacky, clich\u00e9d soap\nopera sentimentality into which it\ncould have easily fallen. I took two\nextremely cynical friends to see it\nwith me and we all were incredibly\nmoved. Like Ram\u00f3n in his dreams,\nThe Sea Inside often soars.\nChoosing death\nHaj Alttahir sees a riveting, moving and sensitive drama about a paralysed man\u2019s\ndesire to end his life\nThe Sea Inside / Mar Adentro\nDirector: Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar\nStarring: Javier Bardem, Bel\u00e9n\nRueda, Lola Due\u00f1as, Mabel Rivera,\nCelso Bugallo\nLength: 126 minutes\nCertificate: PG\nHHHHI\nFilm film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nJavier Bardem (right) in an unusual and remarkable performance as Ram\u00f3n\nWho lives in a pineapple under the sea?\nAfter five years on Nickelodeon,\nSpongebob Squarepants makes his\nway from the bottom of the ocean\nto the big screen. So how exactly do\nyou keep the viewers entertained for\n90 minutes? The least you could do\nis give it an interesting plot!\nFor those who are unfamiliar with\nSpongebob, he is a yellow sponge\nwho wears square pants and\nlives in a community called Bikini\nBottom, in a pineapple under the\nsea. Spongebob and his best friend\nPatrick (a starfish) are completely\noptimistic, cheerful and light-heart-ed. This merriness is crushed when\nSpongebob doesn\u2019t get the managerial position at the new Krusty Krab\nhamburger restaurant because he\nis a \u2018kid\u2019, despite the fact that his\ndedication has won him hundreds\nof \u2018employee of the month\u2019 awards\nin the past.\nMeanwhile, in a place not too far\naway from the Krusty Krab restau-rant, lies the tiny evil genius that is\nPlankton. Plankton\u2019s intentions are\nto steal the secret formula of the\nKrab\u2019s hamburger and subsequently rule the world. Having tried all\nhis evil plans (stored in an evil plan\ndrawer) from A to Y, he loses hope\nof world domination. However, his\nspirits are raised when his (make-believe) computer wife reminds him\nthat there is an extra letter in the\nalphabet \u2013 Z! In fact, not only does\nPlankton find plan Z, but he also\nfinds it to be \u2018evil, diabolic and lemon\nscented\u2019.\nThe plan goes extremely well. Mr\nKrabs is framed for stealing King\nNeptune\u2019s crown (the main purpose of which is to cover the King\u2019s\nshiny bald head). Plankton steals\nthe secret formula to Krab\u2019s hamburger and offers a bucket helmet\nwith every purchase. Eventually\nSpongebob and Patrick go on a mission to retrieve the stolen crown in\norder to save Mr Krab\u2019s life, stop\nBikini Bottom from being taken over\nby Plankton and prove that they are\nmen, not kids. To do this, they have\nto go to Shell City, from where noone ever returns.\nThe movie, together with its obviously intelligent and complicated\nplot, also had lessons of self acceptance and self respect. This is where\nthe reader should toss their head\nbackwards and laugh. It was a painfully extended version of a 30 minute\ntelevision programme. It is cartoonish enough for students to tolerate,\nand it does have occasional funny\nmoments. However, if you do actually laugh, you should be ashamed\nof yourself.\nThe movie would probably be great\nfor major fans, especially kids, since\nit has the inspirational \u2018it\u2019s okay to\nbe a kid\u2019 message. But it won\u2019t win\nover many other people. As for the\nsongs, they weren\u2019t catchy or even\ntuneful. Horrible is all I can say.\nNothing is really witty, except perhaps the \u2018lemon scented\u2019 tag line.\nThe rest is just plain craziness.\nIf you\u2019re looking for humour along\nthe lines of Finding Nemo, this won\u2019t\nget you there at all. The movie is\ncompletely colourful with creatures\nof all sorts and has too many senseless messages.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 17 February 2005\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES felix@ic.ac.uk\n11\nBy Robert Felstead\nA musical... about chess? How\ndoes that work? The answer\nis: \u201cVery well!\u201d\nMusical theatre gets a hard\ntime of it. It\u2019s often seen as\ncheesy, corny and clich\u00e9d. A\nstreet full of people suddenly\nburst into song and start to\nwalk in time, singing loudly\nin harmony before swinging\nround lamp posts. Or tough\nstreet gangs in New York skip\nlightly into a ballet sequence\nas they fight each other. Plots\nare predictable as bad guy\nturns good, falls in love with\nthe unobtainable glamorous\ngirl, wins her heart, and they\nboth live happily ever after.\nBut it\u2019s not all like that.\nLast month, the BBC televised the recent West End\nsmash hit Jerry Springer\nThe Opera to much contro-versy. There was nothing\ncorny or clich\u00e9d about that.\nIt was inventive, exciting new\nmusic built around an origi-nal, humorous plot parodying some of the extremes of\ntoday\u2019s society.\nAlthough West End theatres are enjoying a revival\nand box offices are grossing\nmillions for classics like Les\nMiserables, The Phantom of\nthe Opera and Chitty Chitty\nBang Bang, people still don\u2019t\nsee musical theatre as a \u2018serious\u2019 art form.\nBut that needn\u2019t be the\ncase.\nMusical theatre very often\ntackles ideas and topics that\nother art forms wouldn\u2019t dare\nto touch. This is illustrated in\nthe current West End show\nThe Producers, where two\nproducers set out to try to\nmake a musical about Hitler,\nin the hope that it will fail.\nIn some cases, musical\ntheatre succeeds because\nof the very blatant suspension of reality that it provides.\nWhen you see a chorus of Ku\nKlux Klan members tap dancing (Jerry Springer), Nazis\nsoldiers singing and dancing\ngaily (The Producers), or a\nman-eating plant singing like\nthe king of soul (Little Shop\nof Horrors) this somehow\nmakes the unacceptable or\nunbelievable palatable.\nHowever, on a more serious\nlevel, the beauty of song and\ndance is that they can connect directly into the brains\nof the audience and communicate with them in a way that\nisn\u2019t possible within the constraints of language alone.\nMusical theatre can be like\nwatching opera, dance and\ndrama rolled into one. Often,\nwatching someone sing and\ndance a role can be far more\naffecting than just watching\nthem act it \u2013 provided that the\nmusic and choreography are\nboth strong.\nFor every corny, cheesy and\nclich\u00e9d musical out there,\nthere is another touching,\nbeautiful and poignant work\ntoo. So much musical theatre\nis never seen by the mass\naudience, because of the commercial nature of the art. The\nWest End is dominated by\nLloyd Webber and a handful\nof shows based on the back-catalogue of famous pop/rock\nbands.\nBut you don\u2019t have to go to\nthe West End.\nNext week, for one week\nonly, the Imperial College\nUnion Musical Theatre\nSociety will be producing\nChess. The musical was written by Benny Andersson,\nBjorn Ulvaeus and Tim Rice,\nrunning in the West End in\n1985 and on Broadway in\n1989.\nThe action takes place\nagainst the backdrop of the\nCold War in the early 1980s\nand follows the East versus\nWest story on a number of\ndifferent levels. On the sur-face, we see the World Chess\nChampionship taking place\nbetween the American and\nRussian Grandmasters\n(Freddie and Anatoly). Things\nbecome complicated, though,\nwhen a love story unfolds\nbetween Florence (American)\nand Anatoly (Russian).\nFurthermore, we learn about\ngoings-on in Florence\u2019s past\ninvolvingherfatherduringthe\nHungarian Uprising of 1956.\nAs part-Hungarian, Florence\nstill feels resentful towards\nRussia for its involvement\nin this episode. This leads to\nsome underhand diplomacy\nby American and Russian\nagents. The three stories are\nclosely interwoven, and the\nstory of chess becomes an\nallegory to link them all.\nChess is an emotional,\ndiplomatic and sporting bat-tle, which sees loyalties and\nfriendships stretched to the\nlimit. It is an incredible work\nof musical theatre: with a\nsolid, complex and twisting\nstoryline woven around very\ndeep and interesting charac-ters, it fuses together a wide\nvariety of musical styles from\norchestral to choral, rock to\npop.\nCheesy, corny and clich\u00e9d it\nis not. But if you want a night\nof real musical theatre, with\na fascinating plot, intriguing characters and beautiful\nmusic, come to see Chess.\n\u25cf MTSoc presents Chess\nfrom 22 to 26 February at\n7.30pm in the Union Concert\nHall (doors 7pm). Tickets,\npriced \u00a34.50 for students, are\navailable from ICU reception or on the door. For more\ninformation, visit www.union.\nic.ac.uk/mtsoc. Chess is part\nof ArtsFest05.\nMUSICAL THEATRE\nSOCIETY\nA musical about chess?\nLast year\u2019s MTSoc production, Little Shop Of Horrors\nBy Cristina Rodr\u00edguez\nTrobajo\nThink about all those wonderful things that only happen once a year. Christmas:\n25 December. Your birthday:\n(read as appropriate). End\nof the College year: 24 June.\nPicocon: 19 February.\nFor those of you puzzled\nby this last event, let me tell\nyou what I\u2019m talking about.\nPicocon is the one-day convention run by Imperial\nCollege Science Fiction,\nFantasy and Horror Society\n(ICSF for short) at the Union\nin Beit Quad. It is smaller\nthan most conventions (ours\nonly lasts 10 hours), but don\u2019t\nbe deceived by its size: a long-lasting tradition of success is\nbacking us up.\nPicocon is in its 22nd year,\nreaching the respectable age\nwhen the event is older than\nsome of the people organising it. If you are still unsure\nabout what Picocon is, you\nprobably ought to come find\nout for yourself. I can tell you\nit is a fun day, filled with dis-cussions, games, stalls and\nall sorts of randomness you\nwill appreciate.\nThis year, we will enjoy the\npresence of three greats of\nBritish science fiction and\nfantasy as our guests.\nGwyneth Jones is a writer\nand critic of science fiction\n(also known as Ann Halam,\nwriter of teenage horror fic-tion) and one of our returning\nauthors. She won the 2002\nArthur C Clarke award for\nher novel Bold As Love, and\nher novel Life has been nominated for the 2004 Philip K\nDick award.\nJon Courtenay Grimwood\nis well known in SF circles as the author of the\nArabesk trilogy (Pashazade,\nEffendi and Felaheen, which\nhave won several awards,\nincluding the Arthur C\nClarke for Pashazade).\nHis latest novel, Stamping\nButterflies, has been nominated for the 2004 British\nScience Fiction Association\nawards.\nBrian Stableford is the\nproof that we treat our\nguests very well, as this will\nbe his fourth Picocon. He\nhas been publishing books\nfor almost 40 years, writing\nover 50 novels and almost\n200 short stories, as well as\nmany non-fiction titles. Two\nof his collections of short sto-ries, Asgard\u2019s Secrets and\nSheena and Other Gothic\nTales, are about to go to\npress.\nPicocon 22 will open its\ndoors at 10am, with the\nabsence of a fish duel. At 11,\nthe events will begin in the\nUnion Dining Hall (UDH),\nwith a welcome speech from\nSimon, the ICSF ChairEntity,\nand a talk from Gwyneth\nJones on the topic of insan-ity.\nAfterwards, we will have\na lunch break of an hour\nand a half, during which\nthe Destruction of Dodgy\nMerchandise(DoDM)auction\nwill take place: those really\ntacky pieces of merchandise\ntagging along after every\nsingle film and TV series\nmade today will be up for\nsale, with all proceeds going\nto RAG. If you win the auc-tion, you can keep the piece,\nor, if you truly dislike it and\nwish to destroy it, we will have\nliquid nitrogen and heavy\nblunt instruments available\nfor your enjoyment.\nAt 1.30pm, Jon Courtenay\nGrimwood will hold a Q&A\nsession, followed at 2.30 by\na talk by Brian Stableford on\nthe myth of the Space Age.\nAt 3.30, all our guest speakers will take part in a panel\ndiscussion.\nAt 4.30 there will be an\nhour of silly games. You all\nknow them: Just a Minute,\nMornington Crescent... and,\nif you don\u2019t, you should come\nand learn!\nFinally, to round up the\nday, there\u2019s The Quiz at 6.00.\nPicocon will close its doors\nat 7pm, without a fish duel,\nof course.\nAs if this wasn\u2019t enough,\nduring the whole day there\nwill be wargames, LAN\ngaming, capture the hat,\na scavenger hunt, book\nstalls, lots of insanity and\ngood fun.\nYou don\u2019t need to be a member to come. You don\u2019t even\nneed to be into sci-fi. Come\nfor the talks, the games,\nthe Destruction of Dodgy\nMerchandise, the people, the\nheck of it, or the absence of a\nfish duel. But come.\nPicocon 22 will take place\non Saturday 19 February in\nthe Union Building, from\n10am to 7pm. Entrance fees\nare \u00a37 for normal entrance /\n\u00a35 concessions / \u00a33 for members of ICSF. See you there!\nPicocon 22\nSCIENCE FICTION,\nFANTASY AND HORROR\nSOCIETY\nThis is what a furby looks like when immersed in liquid\nnitrogen. Want to know what happens next?

    "content": "Fancy a spot of apr\u00e8s-ski?\nLast month, a team of Imperial College students visited Switzerland to take\nwith Jenny Austin,\nGavin Daisley, Alex Law,\nJames Reddick and\nAdit Singhal\nAh Switzerland, a fair swag\nof clich\u00e9s: irresistible choc-olates, yodelling Heidis,\nhumourless bankers, international bureaucracies and\nan orderly, anally retentive\nand rather bland national\npersona. But Harry Lime\nwas wrong on more than one\naccount when, in The Third\nMan, he said 500 years of\nSwiss democracy and peace\nhad produced nothing more\nthan the cuckoo clock. For a\nstart, the Germans invented\nthis monstrous timepiece.\nSecondly, the Swiss, who are\na brainy lot, have won more\nNobel Prizes and registered\nmore patents per capita than\nany other nation on earth.\nThirdly, as we were too find\nout, they\u2019re quite a sporty\nbunch too.\nSo the scene was set for\nthe fifth IDEA League sports\nevent. For the uninitiated\nof you, the IDEA League\nis a collaboration between\nImperial College, Delft, ETH\nZurich and Aachen universi-ties, and this collaboration is\nstrengthened each year by a\nsports tournament. This year,\nImperial took on the cream of\nEuropean universities at bad-minton, basketball and water\npolo, and no-one was in the\nleast bit intimidated for the\nsimple reason that we were\nall about to spend three days\nin the lofty splendour of the\nSwiss mountains in a small,\nexclusive ski resort called\nDavos.\nIndeed, despite ETH Zurich\nhaving a sports hall three\ntimes the size of London on\ntheir doorstep, they quite\nrightly felt that everyone\nwould prefer playing indoor\nsports at a height of 1560m,\nwith a view of the Alps out the\nwindow.\nAnd so, on day two, we\nfound ourselves trudging\nthrough three feet of the whitest snow at 7.45am towards\nthe swimming pool for the\nwater polo tournament. The\nstupid o\u2019clock start was necessary because at 12pm the\nwhole pool was being turned\ninto a conference centre for\nthe world economic forum.\nWhich was comforting, as it\nmeant that even world leaders subscribed to the fact that\nwork is best done when combined with the opportunity for\na spot of skiing!\nThe water polo was played\nin a round robin format. First\nup for Imperial were Aachen,\nwho were the eventual tournament winners, beating\neveryone. Imperial put out a\ndisciplined defensive strat-egy, but Aachen had some\nbig outside shooters and were\nable to find the back of the\nnet from distance, going 4-1 up at the end of the first\nperiod. Imperial managed to\npull the score back to 5-4 in\nthe second period, but in the\nend the strength and depth of\nAachen proved too much, and\nthe game ended 10-4 in their\nfavour. Tim Keating scored all\nImperial\u2019s goals.\nOur next game was against\nZurich, a weaker side than\nAachenbutwithtwoverygood\nplayers. One of these players\nwas very strong on 2m (cen-tre forward) and won many\nexclusion fouls and goals.\nRichard Thoburn found himself \u2018wrapped\u2019 (three strikes\nand you\u2019re out) early in the\nsecond period and Imperial\nlost an important defensive\nplayer. The game ended 11-8\nto Zurich. Tim Keating was\nonce again the top scorer with\nfive goals, Chris Iliadis scored\ntwo and Mary Kan scored the\nother.\nOur final game was against\nDelft, and it followed straight\nafter the Zurich game with\nlittle time for recovery. This\ngame would decide third\nplace, and it was very closely\ncontested with Imperial and\nDelft always within one or two\ngoals of each other. We played\nwith passion and every player,\nthough tired, gave 100%. Sadly\nwe were unlucky to draw 9-9,\ngiving up possession cheaply\nwith 20 seconds remaining.\nDelft scored with only eight\nseconds on the clock.\nAachen had a fearsome\ncheering squad and throughout the tournament they were\nwinning, with well-rehearsed\nchants of support. However,\nImperial also had a fantastic\nset of fans (especially given\nthat the matches started at\n8am!) It was great for the\nwater polo team to have so\nmuch support from the side-lines.\nImperial finished in last\nplace on goal difference, but\nit was a great learning expe-rience, cementing a great\nteam spirit. A special mention\nshould go to Soren, our IDEA\nbasketball player come water\npolo super-sub who agreed\nto play with us at the last\nminute. Tim Keating must\nsurely have been \u2018man of the\nmatches\u2019, scoring 90% of the\ngoals.\nNext up was the men\u2019s bas-ketball. Aachen\u2019s team consisted of footballers (appar-ently Aachen don\u2019t do bas-ketball, so their footballers\nand rowers battled it out to\nsee who would go), who were\nroyally trounced by Imperial.\nZurich\u2019s team had a combined height equivalent to\nthe matterhorn, which is due\nto the combination of alpine\nair and not much to do other\nthan grow, and so we were\nroyally trounced. Last up was\nthe cheeky team from Delft.\nIn a game that would decide\nwho would come second,\nImperial were in a commanding position, however, with\nfour minutes left Delft inched\ntwo points in front whereupon\nthey started a song and dance\nin double Dutch about technical fouls and the like until\nthe time ran out. Sadly we\nfinished third.\nIf you were to see Imperial\u2019s\nladies\u2019 team and guess the\nsport they play, you\u2019d be\nunlikely to say basketball.\nYou could say that Imperial\u2019s\nwomen\u2019s team is \u201cvertically\nchallenged\u201d. However, with\nthe kit finally arriving the day\nbefore we departed, our girls\nwere raring to go and ready\nto make the College proud.\nOn arrival in Switzerland\nwe discovered that our counterparts were not so vertically challenged and thought\n\u201coh dear\u201d (or something\nalong those lines!) Our first\nmatch was against the team\nfrom Aachen, who had no less\nthan three women over six\nfeet tall. But we were able to\nprove that skills can count\nfor more than height, when\nat half time we were in the\nlead. Unfortunately Aachen\u2019s\ncoach realised their advantage and in the second half\nput out their tallest team.\nOur girls put up their best\ndefence, but if your opponent\nis a foot taller than you, she\nis going to get the ball! So we\nnarrowly lost the match.\nWe suffered defeats in our\nother two matches, but did\nourselves proud and our spectators were impressed with\nthe talent on the team. Our\ntwo Spanish players, Beatriz\nAlcolea and Olalla Del Rio,\ndeserve a special mention\nfor their fearless determina-tion. Many of our points came\nthanks to their fast breaks.\nAnd then there was bad-minton. The actual time spent\nplaying badminton during the\nwhole tour was about two\nhours. Imperial came second\nout of the four universities in\nthe competition, beaten narrowly by Aachen. The format\nof the games was strange to\nsay the least. Normally, all\nmatches are the best of three\ngames to 15 points each, but\nthe rotund organiser decided\nto make the matches timed, ie\nwhoever has the most points\nafter 20 minutes of playing\nwins. Folly. This format didn\u2019t\nhelp the Swiss (though neither did their hangovers) due\nto the fact that the Aachen\nteam had one amazing pair\nwho destroyed all of our pairs\nin 20 minutes. Before the tour,\ntypically, Imperial had decided that if anyone lost a match,\nthey would have to drink as\nmany shots as points they\nlost by. This was quickly abandoned when Adit and Heather\nlost one of our matches 49-11.\nBut the matches were good,\nand after being content with\nour performance, we got\ndown to the serious work: the\ndrinking.\nAnd so with the bulk of tournament complete, all that\nremained were a few days\nof damned good skiing and a\nfinale event in a little thing\ncalled Hornschlitten Rennen.\nEntering what was casually described as a four\nman sledging competition,\nImperial\u2019s four volunteers,\nGavin Daisley, Soren Krause,\nDmitry Pestov and Angharad\nCare, had amiable thoughts\nof pleasant days spent in the\nprime of one\u2019s youth on the\nold rabbit hill with two inches of snow and a homemade\nsledge. Little did they know\nthat this \u2018casual sledging\nevent\u2019 was actually a 60kg 2m\nlong sledge (no tea trays for\nthem). One person sits at the\nfront with blades on to steer\nthe sledge, whilst the other\nthree sit behind, clinging on\ndesperately as brakes for this\nmonster by wedging their delicate feet into the snow.\nWith only one practice run,\nwhere they spent less time\non the course than a UCL\nstudent doing physics, it was\nfelt that Zurich had to be the\noverwhelming favourites due\nto the convenient fact that\nthey have a national coach.\nIn the semi-finals it was\nImperial versus Aachen. The\ntimes in the trials had been\nvery close, so this looked to\nbe an exciting race. Aachen\npulled away first and no-one\nthought we had a chance.\nHowever, with Gavin employing a new driving style,\nImperial kicked in and around\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 17 January 2005\n24\nRICHARD WALKER\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(CLUBS & SOCIETIES)\nSPORT felix@ic.ac.uk\nAn Imperial basketball player looks on as an opponent shoots\n\n"

    "content": "By Cassandra Aldrich\nand Gabriella Silvestri\nCareers Editors\nNISHANT DESHPANDE\ngraduated in 1997 with a\nBEng in Information Systems\nEngineering (ISE). He\u2019s had\nan interesting career path,\nlike many IC graduates.\nAfter Imperial, he joined\nGoldman Sachs in London\nfor three years, after which\nhe decided to do an MS in\nArtificial Intelligence at\nStanford. This was followed\nby a job at the Oracle headquarters in California, while\nat present he\u2019s working for a\nstartup company in the US.\nDid you always want to\ngo into IT?\nNo. I really didn\u2019t know\nmuch about computers at\nschool. I liked chemistry and\nalmost went to do Chemical\nEngineering at Nottingham\nUniversity. Then I decided to\ntake a year out between Alevels and university. During\npart of that year, I worked for\na software company, and from\nthen on, I was in IT.\nCan you tell us more\nabout what your present\nwork involves?\nFor the last five months, I\nhave been working at Efficient\nFrontier (www.efrontier.\ncom). We are a search marketing company that handles\nkeyword advertising for our\ncustomers. Therefore, when\nyou search for something on\nGoogle or Yahoo, you seethe\n\u2018true\u2019 search results and the\npaid ads on top and on the\nside. There is a live 24-hour\nauction going on amongst the\ncompeting ads to be shown,\nfor each search phrase.\nWe optimize this advertising channel by applying\nquantitative methods and a\nportfolio approach to handling all the keywords and\nads our customer has and\nenabling the customer to better achieve their advertising\ngoals.\nSince joining, I have been\nworking on exposing a lot of\nour functionality to customers via our website. The technology I am using is Java,\nLinux, Struts, and a lot of\ndatabase work.\nWhat did your work at\nGoldman Sachs involve?\nHow did you come to do\nyour MS in Artificial Intelligence at Stanford?\nEach business unit at\nGoldman Sachs had its own\nIT to develop and support\napplications for that busi-ness. I joined a new team for\nthe Equity Capital Markets\ngroup in London. We started\nwith three people, including\nmy boss. We learnt about the\nbusiness and then developed\napplications to make the business processes more efficient.\nI was there for three years,\nand I really enjoyed it.\nI had several motivations\nfor doing an MS. I was keen\nto explore and to get a much\ndeeper and broader set of\nskills and knowledge tech-nicall. Also, of course, there\nwas the lure of Silicon Valley\nand California at the height of\nthe dot com boom.\nSo, all of the above pointed\nto Stanford. As for Artificial\nIntelligence, I took an\n\u2018Introduction to AI\u2019 course\nin my first quarter, and got\ninterested in the subject, and\ncontinued to take AI courses\nuntil I had enough to specialize in AI (the degree is\nfrom the Computer Science\ndepartment).\nDo you think there are\nmore opportunities in\nthe States in your line of\nwork?\nDefinitely, simply because the\nUS market is so large, and\nthe Bay Area (no one calls it\n\u2018Silicon Valley\u2019 here) is unlike\nany other place for technol-ogy, not just compared to\nEurope but pretty much anywhere else in the US. It is just\nlike London is the centre for\nfinance and investment banking in Europe and New York\nthe centre in the US.\nHaving said that, I think\nLondon and Cambridge have\na lot of things going on in the\ntechnology sector, and there\nhave already been some success stories. I am sure there\nwill be more in the future.\nHow was your experience at Imperial?\nI was in the ISE batch, and\nwe renamed it \u2018Instant Sanity\nErosion\u2019. It was a small class\n\u2013 I think the BEng batch was\nprobably around 35 students\n\u2013 and most people were really hard working, so it was\nhard work just keeping up\nwith everyone. But, of course,\nI think for most people the\nundergraduate degree is the\nmost fun; it was for me.\nThe teaching and facilities\nwere very good. Looking back,\nI wish I had spent more time\nexploring the general area\nthat I was studying; we were\nat college when the internet\nwas taking off. But I\u2019ve never\nreally liked sitting in a basement in front of a computer\nscreen for more time than\nnecessary, especially when\nthe other options were sitting\nin the Queens Arms...\nDo you think being at\nImperial has equipped\nyou well for your future?\nI have worked with people\nfrom many different univer-sities, and I think you can\nalways count on a person\nfrom Imperial to know his or\nher stuff, and be really hardworking and tenacious in\nfinding solutions, much more\nthan most other universities.\nI don\u2019t know whether that is\nthe effect of a few years at\nImperial, or the type of person that comes to IC. Either\nway, if you can do fairly well at\nIC with the stiff competition\nthat exists, I think you can be\nconfident you can do well in\nthe future.\nDo you have any advice\nto students wanting\nto get into your line of\nwork or advice resulting\nfrom your experiences?\nWork as a software engineer\nfaces increasing competition from people in developing countries, like India\nand China. You have to have\nsomething extra to be of value\nin this field. This means having first a really solid understanding of the basics \u2013 the\nmore I have worked in this\nfield, the more times I have\nhad to look at the basics to get\nto a better solution.\nThe other great thing about\nthis field is that there is very\nlittle between theory and\npractice. If you know some-thing, you should be able to\nimplement it. Keep thinking\nlike that and trying to put it\nin practice, and your learning\nwill increase exponentially.\nJOHN STAVELEY graduated from Imperial in 1997\nwith an Honours and a\nMasters Degree in Chemical\nEngineering. He was treasurer of the Entertainments\nCommittee at IC and also\nwrote for various College\npublications. He then went\non to complete an MPhil in\ncomputational fluid dynamics\nand a Postgraduate Diploma\nof Management while at\nUMIST, where he also did\npart time tutoring and dem-onstrating. After finishing\nhis studies, he worked for\nEnviros Software Consulting\nTeam. His role as a software\nconsultant to the environmental sector involved working with clients such as BP\n,\nthe Department of Trade and\nIndustry, the Environment\nAgency, the MoD and\nKuwaiti Oil and Gas. After\nfouryears with Enviros, he\u2019s\nnow a software engineer for\nWalker Morris Online where\nhe is involved in designing\nand developing software\nproducts and also in the\nmarketing and sales of these\nproducts.\nDid you always want to\ngo into Software Engineering?\nNo, I was always interested\nin science. My MEng and\nMPhil were both in Chemical\nEngineering, though the\ncomputational element of my\nMPhil was very high. I had\nbeen programming since I\nwas 13 though, so computing\nalways made sense to me.\nWhat made you want to\ndo postgraduate study\nafter you finished at\nImperial?\nI didn\u2019t really feel Imperial\nstretched me. It taught me to\nlearn by rote and I wanted to\nbe more creative with what I\nhad learnt and apply it some-where. Research was very\ninteresting, but doing a EngD\ncourse relies a lot on having a\ngood supervisor, and mine left\nthree months after I joined. I\ngreatly enjoyed research, it\nwas a great personal challenge which I found fulfilling,\nbut I didn\u2019t like the world of\nacademia.\nHow did you come to do\na year of management\nstudies? Would you\nrecommend it to other\npostgraduate scientists\nwho perhaps wish to\nleave research for business or industry?\nThis is the taught part of an\nMBA and is part and parcel\nof the EngD course (four year\nPhD plus applied research\nand management). It\u2019s very\ndifficult to obtain MBA funding in the UK and this was a\ngood way in. I found it very\nuseful and I\u2019m sure it will pay\nme dividends for a good while\nto come.\nI found the transition\nfrom research to industry\nextremely easy \u2013 I\u2019m not\nsure how others would cope.\nI found the world of academia\nvery inward-looking and not\nalways interested in solving\nproblems that would be useful in the real world, whereas\nI always wanted to know how\nto apply research.\nHow was your experience at Imperial?\nI didn\u2019t much like the place.\nThere are better ways of\nspending four years. It\ndeserves as good a reputation\nas Oxford or Cambridge, if not\nbetter for some departments.\nI enjoyed being in London,\nthis has much to offer.\nDo you think being at\nImperial has equipped\nyou well for your future?\nIt gives you an intellectual\nrigour and ability to solve\nproblems. It definitely has a\ncertain style about it, it gives\nyou a work ethic like no other,\nand the name opens doors.\nThere is an oft-quoted statistic that Imperial graduates\nearn consistently more than\ngraduates of other universi-ties. This may be because\nthey choose to stay in London\nwhere salaries are higher...\nbut quality of life isn\u2019t, I\nhave to add. When choosing\nwhere to work, bear in mind\nthat \u00a328k buys very little in\nLondon, whereas in most\nother parts of the country it\nbuys a lot. I believe eventually\nLondon will suffer commercially because of this.\nDo you think that your\nextra-curricular activities during your studies were a big plus\nwhen looking for jobs?\nDid they develop your\nskills?\nI think I got a huge amount\nfrom these activities. They\nwere also fun and allowed\nme to meet some of the\nmore interesting people at\nImperial. They\u2019ve been occasionally mentioned in inter-views. Most people mention\nthe travelling I\u2019ve done since.\nEmployers are looking for\nan individual who can communicate and work as a team.\nThe jobs where this isn\u2019t a\nrequirement are very few\nand far between. I think that\nthis is somewhere Imperial\nlets you down \u2013 you spend\nso much time working that\nyou don\u2019t get much time to\nsocialise.\nDo you have any advice\nto students wanting\nto get into your line of\nwork or advice resulting\nfrom your experiences?\nThe first job is difficult, but\nonce on the ladder things\nare much easier. When you\ngo to interview, know something about their industry and\ncome across as enthusiastic.\nEmphasise your team working and communication skills.\nA key skill for computing is\nattention to detail.\nDon\u2019t walk into the first\njob you get. You don\u2019t need\na job, you need the job. If you\ncan afford to, hold back. The\nmarket is pretty good at the\nmoment, whereas two years\nago it was very difficult.\nBig companies are not\nalways better.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 17 February 2005\n6\nComment felix@ic.ac.uk\nThe Spanish archer (El Bow \u2013 dumped)\nSince we\u2019ve just had Valentine\u2019s Day\nand there\u2019s a lot of love in the air, I\nthought we could change the mood\nthis week by offering you all a few\ntips on how to dump someone without hurting them too much. We have\nall been there, got together with\nsomeone, and for the first few weeks\nit\u2019s great but then you notice a few\nbad habits creeping in... the next\nthing you know, you never want to be\nnear the person again!\nWe\u2019ve all had do it at some stage\nin our lives, or we have all been on\nthe end of a dumping. I was dumped\nonce after 45 minutes! Mind you, I\nwas only 12 at the time. I was also\nonce given the elbow while shopping\nin Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 that was extremely\npainful!\nIn all seriousness though, it\u2019s\nnot fun and it\u2019s always important\nto remember how your actions will\naffect the other person. I suppose\nthere is no easy way of doing something like this, though it is always\ngood to give the other person some\nrespect. The rest of the article will\nhopefully help you to consider your\nactions and make the process that\nlittle bit easier.\nNot all relationships are meant\nto be. And it\u2019s much better to admit\nthat it\u2019s run its course than try to\nsqueeze out every last drop. If you\u2019ve\ndecided to call it a day then play fair\nand let your partner down honestly\nbut gently. A definite goodbye will\nhurt, but it will be easier all round\nif you are clear that the relationship\nis over.\nGive some thought to how you are\ngoing to end the relationship. There\nare right ways and wrong ways and,\nalthough you may no longer care for\nthe other person, don\u2019t humiliate or\nembarrass them. You liked them\nonce and they deserve better. Think\nhow you would like to be treated if\nthe situation was reversed. You cannot be sure how they will react, and\nit may not be pretty, but knowing\nthat you dealt with it decently will\nmean you won\u2019t be dwelling on your\nbad behaviour later on.\nSome choose to end a relationship\nby text message or email. Before\ndoing this, imagine how you would\nfeel if somebody let you down in this\nway. It\u2019s difficult to break bad news\nbut there is less confusion and upset\nif you give the other person a chance\nto air their thoughts back to you\nrather than delivering a one-way\nmessage. You don\u2019t have to get into a\npost-relationship analysis, and don\u2019t\nlet them talk you round if you\u2019re sure\nfinishing is the best thing, but face-to-face or over the phone shows a\nlittle more guts and respect.\nIf you opt to end it to their face,\nthen do consider where you\u2019ll do it.\nA public place may not be the best\noption if you think the other person\nis going to start crying or creating\na scene; although if you are scared\nthat they will take it very badly then\nyou may feel safer with other people\naround.\nIt can be confusing if the person you thought you were seeing\nhas simply stopped contacting you.\nThe hardest thing about this kind\nof break-up is not knowing what\u2019s\ngoing on. If your partner has quietly skulked off then you may end up\nmaking excuses for them. Don\u2019t kid\nyourself that because you haven\u2019t\nverbally split up, your relationship\nmust still be OK. Be brave, pick up\nthe phone and find out what\u2019s going\non for sure. You don\u2019t deserve to be\nignored! If the news is bad, at least\nyou know where you stand and can\nmove on. Asking or not asking them\nis not going to change the way they\nfeel about you, while avoiding this\nconversation is only delaying any\nheartache.\nThe end of a relationship can leave\nyou feeling miserable, even if you\nwere the one doing the dumping.\nBeing dumped is never nice, and\nif you are the one on the end of a\ndumping it can often make you feel\nrejected and depressed.\nIf these feelings continue and start\nto affect your everyday life, especially in your studies or at work, it\nmay be a good idea to talk someone\nabout it. Here are some tips.\n\u25cf Plenty more fish in the sea \u2013\neven though you are upset now, it is\nimportant to remember that there\nare other men and women out there\nwho are just as nice as the person\nyou have just had a relationship\nwith.\n\u25cf Support network \u2013 if your partner\nwas your support in life then it\u2019s\nimportant to find alternative sup-port. Look to friends and family, or if\nthis isn\u2019t appropriate look for agencies that can help.\n\u25cf It\u2019s not your fault \u2013 relationships\nbreak down for all sorts of reasons.\nYou\u2019ll soon find someone who suits\nyour personality more.\n\u25cf Have a good time \u2013 see it as a\nliberating experience, get stuck into\nthe things you enjoy, meet up with\nfriends and start to do the things\nyou stopped doing when you were in\na relationship.\n\u25cf If it\u2019s over it\u2019s over \u2013 resist the\nurge to ring up and contact your ex.\nLet them do the chasing!\nIf you feel that you need further\nhelp, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact The Information and Advice\nCentre. If we can\u2019t help, we\u2019ll refer\nyou to someone who can. Make the\nInformation and Advice Centre your\none stop shop for all your welfare\nissues.

Of\ncourse it went through due process\nand there were plenty of very tedious naysayers who predicted that\nonline voting would result in lower\nturnouts, more irregularities and,\ngenerally, the end of the world as we\nknow it. This has not happened. In\nfact, far from it.\nSure, there were difficulties with\nour first electronic voting attempt\n(last year\u2019s sabbatical elections).\nDuring the Council elections earlier this year, things were still being\nironed out. There will always be\nproblems with the introduction of\nany new system. Many problems are\navoidable through testing (and we\ndid this) but some just won\u2019t appear\nuntil you actually test \u2018in the field\u2019.\nNow that we have a fair amount of\nexperience, as an organisation, of\nrunning electronic voting, we are\nmuch better at it and able to run it\nvery successfully.\nIt caused grief for lots of people\n(mainly me, as that\u2019s where anger\nwas directed) along the way, but ultimately it was an investment that has\npaid off. The motivation the whole\ntime was to improve the Union by\nmaking it more representative of\nthe student body through higher\nelection turnouts. And that has now\nbeen achieved.\nIn the Union\u2019s Strategic Review\nall-student survey last term, there\nwas an overwhelmingly positive\nresponse to the introduction of electronic voting. And now, we have seen\nthe largest democratic exercise ever\nheld at Imperial College. At the time\nof writing, over 2700 students have\nvoted in at least one of the sabbatical elections. This is unprecedented.\nThe previous best was when I was\nfirst elected with around 1400 vot-ers, in a paper ballot. Turnout is\nover 22%, the highest it\u2019s ever been.\nIt doesn\u2019t quite get up to the 27%\nrealised in the NUS Referendum\nin 2002, however we had far less\nstudents then. (One of the main\nchanges I made last year was to\nextend full Union membership to\npart time students, who have always\nbeen less involved, which has made\na big difference to our membership.\nMany PhD students, traditionally\nuninvolved, are also registered as\npart time students because they\nare paid by the College to do their\nresearch.)\nNo doubt some people will have\nlittle niggles on one or two things\nthat could have been done better.\nAnd yes, of course they could. There\nis always room for improvement.\nBut let\u2019s not take away from the\nfacts: many students who previously\nwould never have voted have done\nso, and the Union is now in a much\nstronger position to legitimately\nrepresent students than at any time\nin history.\nAnd please, can Union hacks stop\nthe debate about electronic voting?\nIt\u2019s definitely the right way to go.\nPaper ballots are history. It\u2019s time\nto move on.\nE-voting \u2013 end of story\nSTATE OF\nTHE UNION\nMUSTAFA ARIF\nUNION PRESIDENT\nMonday was Valentine\u2019s Day, that\nannual festival of relentless choco-lates, roses and nauseating greeting cards. Inevitably, the day has\nearned itself the reputation of being\nthe most romantic date in the cal-endar, and many couples take the\nopportunity to spend \u2018quality time\u2019\nwith each other. At this point, you\u2019re\nprobably wondering why I\u2019m writing\nthis drivel. There are a few rea-sons.\nFirstly, I\u2019ve wanted a good excuse\nto write a column entitled \u2018The Joy\nof Sex\u2019 ever since I conceived the\ntitle in October, and this seemed as\ngood a reason as any.\nSecondly, it\u2019s always worth re-iter-ating the message of safe sex. Nigel\nCooke, the Union\u2019s Student Adviser,\ndid a superb column on sexually\ntransmitted infections in Issue 1312\n(check the archives online). It\u2019s\nworth adding that you can get advice\non sexual health from the college\u2019s\nHealth Centre in Prince\u2019s Gardens,\nor pop down to the Information and\nAdvice Centre to pick up more infor-mation.\nThirdly, I hope all you couples\nout there had a lovely time on\nValentine\u2019s Day. I didn\u2019t. I was in the\noffice until 9pm, then went home\nsad and lonely. The sabbatical life-style, far from being glitzy and excit-ing, is now beginning to take its toll\non my personal life. Last year, the\nPresident (or someone acting on\nhis behalf) advertised for a first lady\nin this organ. I have yet to decide\nwhether I will have to resort to this.\nMore important, perhaps, than\nsex, is communication. In this season of elections, I have accompanied the vote-hunting candidates to\nplaces as far and wide as Silwood\nand Wye, and one thing that became\nclear from talking to students was\nthat good communication makes life\na lot easier.\nCommunication with the student body is something we pull the\nCollege up on, but we often fail in\nit ourselves. It came as no surprise\nthat this was one of the Executive\u2019s\nkey findings in the Strategic Review\ndocument that will be presented to\nCouncil, the Union\u2019s governing body,\ntonight.\nWhat are we doing to improve\nthe situation? For feedback on our\ncommercial services, the Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services),\nSameena Misbahuddin, has started\nthe \u2018Your Say\u2019 initiative (check out\nwww.union.ic.ac.uk/yoursay). For\nmy own part, I am trying to manage\nme emails better, and get on top of\nmy paperwork, partly with the help\nof an extra member of administrative staff.\nThe battle continues, and the situation is far from perfect; if I have let\nyou down by poor communication,\nI would like to apologise by buying\nyou a pint (or a coffee, if you prefer)\nand giving you some of my time. If\nyou have any suggestions of how we\ncan improve communication, please\nemail me on dpew@ic.ac.uk.\nUNCLE SAM\nSAM RORKE\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(EDUCATION & WELFARE)\nThe joy of... sex\n\n"

This year\nwe were pitched against\nReading, Surrey and the Vets.\nThe short story here is that\nwe won, outright. That\u2019s how\ngood we are, you see. Our\ndressage tests were all close\nto perfection and we all went\nclear in the jumping. So, the\nday ended with us driving off\ninto the sunset clutching our\nshiny red first place rosettes\nand beaming with pride. But\nthen I woke up\u2026 and it was\n6.30 in the morning, really\ncold and still dark.\nNot a great start to a day\nthat didn\u2019t get much better.\nThe train ride was verging on\nthe duller side of not interest-ing, and then we had to battle the streets of Reading to\nfind the damn stables, which\nwe managed to do with five\nminutes to spare. So maybe\nthings weren\u2019t going to be\nso bad.\nThe dressage came first,\nas it tends to do because\nthe rules say so. The horses\nseemed ok. There was nothing exciting or interesting, so\nwe picked who we wanted\nand off we went. Kat rode\nfirst on a skewbald cob that\nresembled a tank and did a\ngood job. Then it was Sarah\non a wiry and sort of balding chestnut called Newman.\nApparently her test went\nwell, according to El and Kat,\nbut the judge didn\u2019t agree and\nsuggested that she \u201ctry to\nride the horse\u201d. Good advice,\nI suppose.\nI was third and probably\ncouldn\u2019t have done worse if I\ntried. William (another wiry\nchestnut) didn\u2019t like me or\nthe arena so stepped out several times. The judge didn\u2019t\nlike this, or me for that mat-ter, and accused me of talking\nduring the test, crazy lady!\nLastly it was El\u2019s turn and\nshe did very well. Her horse\nwas small, cute and looked\nlazy but wasn\u2019t.\nThankful that the first part\nof afternoon was over, we\nsat down for lunch and then\nfound out that we were currently in fourth position. Not\nthat this was a surprise, but\nit definitely didn\u2019t improve\nthe day any. My amazing\nperformance meant that I\nonly did marginally better\nthan the girl who looked like\nshe didn\u2019t even know what a\nhorse was.\nThe end of the day was\njumping. William and\nNewman were back and\nwere joined by a fluffy pony\nand the biggest horse in the\nworld. El chose Newman, Kat\ntook William, Sarah chose\nthe pony, and being bravest (read: dumbest) I had\nPembridge the giant, who\nwas actually gorgeous and\neasy to ride. Kat almost went\nclear but knocked down the\nstyle which was quite hard to\nget a good line to.\nI redeemed myself by going\nclear on Pembridge, as did\nEl although she didn\u2019t have\nany redeeming to do. Sarah\nwas last and the little pony\nwas super-duper but halfway\nround she lost her stirrups so\ncircled away from the jump.\nThis, apparently, meant she\nwas eliminated which was\ntotally harsh and I think it\nwas the wrong decision, but\nwho are we to argue?\nAnd so the day came to an\nend. We pulled up in fourth\nposition with a shocking\nnumber of penalties which\nI won\u2019t divulge here. El got\nherself an individual seventh\nplace. Good for her! But we\nwere glad to get home.\nSomehow, the competition\nhad dragged on for six hours,\nthe scoring was messed up\nbut the highlights were definitely the cat who hung out\non my shoulder a lot, the fat\nugly dog, the blind girl and\nlunch. Oh, and the Union\nlater that evening. That was\nfun too. And just so you know,\nJohn Peers said that thing\nabout a cavalry.\nRIDING\n\u201cYou can\u2019t lead a cavalry\nif you think you look funny\nriding a horse\u201d\nRVC Women\u2019s 1st 12\nWye Women\u2019s 1st 22\nBy Lucy Le Cocq\nThere was only one thing\nbetween Wye and the cup\nfinal: the vets. And we had\na lot to prove. Having never\nput any points past them, we\nwere not prepared to let it\nhappen again. So, avoiding\nroad rage by leaving number\neight to find her own way to\nthe game, we were ready to\nshow the vets how we usually play. And we didn\u2019t hang\naround.\nAlthough everybody was\nfeeling the pressure, we managed to divert this into positive energy and had the first\nscore on the board within\nten minutes. Another one of\nEmily\u2019s elusive (sorry to use\nthis word again; other words\nin the thesaurus were unsuit-able) runs gave us the first\ntry which helped us to settle\nand enjoy the game a little\nmore.\nMassive bandaging was\nneeded for the backs, who all\nseem to have acquired shin\nsplints except Andrea, who\nstill managed to produce a\nbeautiful pink display of bandaging so that she didn\u2019t feel\nleft out. Massive force at the\nbeginning of the game in the\ntackling department from\neverybody appeared to surprise the vets as they had\nnot come up against such a\nforce at the beginning of the\nseason.\nGobby scored the second try\nand then converted it, stamping our authority on the game.\nWye were now free to play in\nour usual style. The backs\nenjoyed prolonged spells of\nrunning after this and made\nmuch ground. Although the\nforwards didn\u2019t exhibit the\nusual storming runs, they\nshowed great strength in\nthe scrum and even turned\nit over.\nSpaz\u2019s and Pike\u2019s breaking\nfrom the scrum produced\nsome great interceptions of\nthe ball and their players.\nOur full back remained calm\nthroughout, even when challenged with some difficult\nkicks and tackles which were\nsuccessfully accomplished.\nBy half time, we had scored\nfour tries and both teams\nwere much relieved to have\na break. We faced uphill into\nthe wind in the second half.\nThe difficult conditions\nallowed the RVC an opportunity to score from a penalty,\nwhich was swiftly taken. They\nmanaged to put another try\npast us later in the second\nhalf.\nThe game was well controlled by both sides, however\nWye came out on top. This\nwas a promising game and\nWye are looking forward to\nthe final, which we intend to\ncontest strongly.\nThe Wye rugby girls were\nthrilled to win and feel that\nthis shows great potential\nfor our cup final and for the\nsevens tournaments that we\nwill be playing in later in the\nseason.\nRUGBY\nWye find right formula\nfor Vets at last\nNext week in Sport:\nReports and reaction from all the\nVarsity matches\n\n"

    "content": "Lights, camera, history\nLaurence Fahrni calls the shots as he checks out the tale of the development of cinema\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 17 February 2005\n20\nBooks books.felix@ic.ac.uk\nGriffith, Keaton, Ozu, Riefenstahl,\nFord, Welles, Bergman, Ciss\u00e9\nChahine, Immamura, Scorsese and\nSokurov. These are just a few of the\ndirectors Mark Cousins considers to\nbe particularly prolific, and I would\nbe surprised if more than a handful\nof readers are familiar with more\nthan four of these names. Of course,\nthis should not discourage you from\nreading The Story of Film.\nCousins\u2019 book doesn\u2019t focus on\nthe mainstream, not because it is\nwritten in a pretentious way, but\nbecause, generally, more successful\nmovies draw from other trendset-ting movies and, thus, are not worth\nmentioning in a book that guides the\nreader through the history of film.\nThe Story of Film is a chronological exploration of the cutting-edge\ncinematic advancements that have\nshaped film over the years.\nThe book is divided into three\nepochs: silent, sound, and digital.\nOver these periods, film evolved\ndue to developments in technology and technique. But the most\nimportant advancements, according\nto Cousins, were the filmmaker\u2019s\nideas.\nNot only does Cousins describe the\nfilms, but he also explains the philosophy of art and its progression,\nsocial influences and even genetics (though briefly). It is impressive\nto see just how much intellectual\nmaterial he draws from, and it\u2019s\nalways refreshing for us Imperial\nCollege students to find artists who\ndon\u2019t have the usual fear of art\u2019s\nnerdier older brother: science.\nSeeing film as art is often less than\nnatural for most people, especially\nafter watching the likes of Faster\nand Even Furiouser. Cousins discusses Hollywood\u2019s reluctance to\nsee film as art, and the tendency\nof studios to follow the safe bet\nwith box office takings in mind. It is\ninteresting to read that American\nfilm was originally based on the\nEast Coast until a patents war drove\nmany companies west at a time\nwhen Los Angeles was just a sleepy\nSouthern California town. Cousins\ncites Germaine Dulac\u2019s 1920s avant-garde films, which were influenced\nby Monet and Charles Baudelaire,\nas an example of art\u2019s influence on\nfilm.\nThe first film was shot in England\nby a French man in 1888. Early\nfilm was mainly focused on \u201ctechnical thrills\u201d like the famous footage of a train pulling into a station\nthat is often associated with the\nbirth of cinema. Only after ten years\ndid films with more than one shot\nappear, making longer scenes and\nfull-length body shots possible.\nThebook\u2019schronologicalstructure\nallows you to appreciate the sequential introduction of the ideas we\nare so accustomed to now. During\ntelevision interviews today, the\ncamera cuts between views of the\nactors\u2019 faces and shoulders. When\nideas like this were conceived, it\nwas thought that sudden changes\nwould mentally jar the audience. A\nreverse example is seen in Laurel\nand Hardy films, which use a fairly\ncommon method of looking directly\ninto the camera. This can feel wrong\nto a viewer not accustomed to the\ntechnique and may have unsettled\nan early twentieth-century audi-ence.\nThe main theme of the book is one\nof schema and variation. Cousins\nhighlights techniques used by directors that are emulated by their\nfavoured predecessors. A typical\nexample (although not mentioned in\nmuch depth in this book) is Quentin\nTarantino\u2019s extensive use of the\nHong Kong film Hu Fen Yung\u2019s\n(City on Fire) plotline. Although\nTarantino borrowed heavily from\nthe storyline, the post-modern techniques such as non-linear progression (cutting back and forth in time)\nare what make the film unique. You\nmay expect that ideas for new filmmaking techniques are running thin,\nbut you will find revolutionary films\nare still being made today.\nFilm is an extraordinarily powerful medium with the ability to\nset social norms. The dominance of\nHollywood can be attributed to the\nwesternisation of eastern culture\nand the world-wide prevalence of\nthe English language. Therefore,\nCousins\u2019 detailed study of the history of film does a lot more than\ndiscuss the plots and techniques\nof various films, making the book a\nfascinating read.\nThe Story of Film\nby Mark Cousins\n(HarperCollins)\nHHHII\n\n"

    "content": "With the creator of Dolly the sheep being granted a licence to clone humans,\nKathryn Lougheed examines the ethical questions surrounding cloning\nscience.felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 17 February 2005 5\nA licence to extract stem cells\nfrom human embryos has\nbeen granted to the creator\nof Dolly the sheep, Professor\nIan Wilmut. The UK regulatory body, the Human\nFertilization and Embryology\nAuthority, has granted the\ntherapeutic cloning licence\nto Wilmut and Dr Paul de\nSouza of the Roslin Institute,\nEdinburgh, and Professor\nChristopher Shaw of King\u2019s\nCollege London. This licence,\nwhich is the second of its\nkind to be awarded in the UK,\nwill allow the team to clone\nhuman embryos for research\npurposes.\nTherapeutic cloning is different from human reproductive cloning, as the embryos\nare only grown up to 14 days\nbefore extracting the stem\ncells. Wilmut has stated that\ncloning a human is ethically\nwrong and following the public shock at Dolly\u2019s creation,\nhe assured the world that he\nwould never consider cloning\nhumans. However, the award\nof this licence has once again\nopened Pandora\u2019s box with\nrespect to the human cloning\nand stem cell debate.\nWilmut and his team want\nto use the stem cells to investigate motor neurone dis-ease, the name given to a\ndebilitating group of conditions that affect the motor\nneurones of the brain and spinal cord. Motor neurones are\nthe nerves which the brain\nuses to send instructions to\nthe muscles in the form of\nelectrical impulses. Wilmut\nwill use a method known as\nnuclear cell replacement,\nwhich involves replacing the\nnucleus of a human egg with\nthe nucleus of a cloned cell: in\nthis case a cell from a motor\nneurone disease sufferer. As\nthe cells divide, stem cells,\nwhich have the potential to\nbecome any cell in the body,\nare produced. The stem\ncells can be differentiated\ninto neuronal cells and compared to normal neurones in\nan effort to understand the\ndefects responsible for motor\nneurone disease.\nStemcelltechnologyhasthe\npotential to alleviate the suffering of thousands of people.\nIn addition to Wilmut\u2019s motor\nneurone research, the ability\nof stem cells to become any\ncell in the body may allow us\nto replace defective or missing cells in persons with dia-betes, Parkinson\u2019s and cystic\nfibrosis. In fact, Japanese\nresearchers recently claimed\nin the Journal of Clinical\nInvestigation to have successfully treated monkeys\nwith a condition similar to\nhuman Parkinson\u2019s through\nstem cell transplantation.\nTherapeutic cloning has the\npotential to not only provide\na steady supply of stem cells\nfor research, but also to eliminate the problem of tissue\nrejection during transplantation by allowing every patient\nto be treated with cells from\nhis or her own body.\nSo what is the problem with\nstem cell technology? The\nmain argument of Christian\nand pro-life groups against\nstem cell technology is based\non the belief that an embryo\nis a living person from the\nmoment of conception, and\nthat extracting stem cells\n\u2013 even from an early embryo\n\u2013 is tantamount to infanti-cide.\nMany see the creation\nof embryos for stem cell\nresearch as an even worse\ncrime than simply harvesting stem cells from existing\nembryos and believe that this\nwill allow scientists to effectively \u2018play God.\u2019 The debate\nover whether the early foetus\nconstitutes life, the potential\nfor life or simply cells in a\nPetri dish will no doubt rage\non.\nAt present, embryos left\nover from fertility treatments\nare the main source of stem\ncells. Aborted foetuses are\nanother source. Is diverting some of these unwanted embryos towards medical research, which has the\npotential to help many, right\nor wrong? Even if these cells\nare, in fact, a person, can we\nreally favour their survival\nover the survival of a living\nperson who could be helped\nby stem cell technology? If\nyou believe using embryonic\nstem cells is equivalent to\ninfanticide, it all comes down\nto whether it is acceptable\nto consider one life expendable for the greater good.\nThis is, after all, the belief\nthat led to some of the most\ndeplorable acts in our history,\nincluding US slavery and the\nHolocaust.\nPro-life groups have pointed out that although scores\nof people on death row in\nAmerica are \u2018destined\u2019 to die,\nwe would never consider harvesting their organs prior to\ntheir executions. According to\nsuch groups, using embryos\nfor their cells is a comparable\nact, and these \u2018cells in a dish\u2019\ndeserve the same respect as\nany living person. Is stem cell\ntechnology creating a biotech\nslave market where humans\nare becoming commodities to\nbe sold for profit?\nHuman reproductive cloning is a huge leap from the\ntherapeutic cloning presently being carried, and is\nconsidered by the vast majority of people to be ethically\nunacceptable. But there will\nalways be some individuals\nwho do not share this opin-ion. Recently we heard about\nLittle Nicky, the kitten cloned\nto replace a dead pet for the\nbargain price of $5000. Would\nthe grieving parents of a dead\nchild or an infertile couple\nconsider human cloning given\nthe choice?\nIs this scenario, similar\nto that portrayed by Aldous\nHuxley in Brave New World\nwhere humans are routinely\ncloned, still science fiction or\ndo we really have something\nto be worried about? Only a\nfew years ago it was thought\nthat the cloning of a human\nembryo might be impossible\nsince removing the nucleus\nwas thought to rob the cell of\nproteinsessentialforsurvival.\nHowever, this hypothesis was\nproved wrong in February\n2004 by a team from South\nKorea who succeeded in cloning human embryos with the\npotential to grow into a range\nof tissue types.\nA piece of research published in October 2004 suggested that the capability to\nclone a human is potentially\nnot that far away when a\nteam of scientists successfully cloned primate embryos\nand implanted them into a\nwomb. Although none of the\npregnancies lasted more than\na month, this is the closest\nanyone has come to cloning a\nprimate, and it brings us one\nstep closer to being able to\nclone a human.\nBut just because we can,\ndoes that mean we will?\n\u201cWilmut stated that\ncloning a human\nbeing is ethically\nwrong... and assured\nthe world that he\nwould never\nconsider this\u201d\nAttack of the cloner\nProf Wilmut and Dolly: last week Wilmut was\ncontroversially given a licence to clone human embryos\nScience science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nBy Kate Wighton\nScience Communication\nIvan Noble, the science and\ntechnology writer for the\nBBC News website, lost his\nbattle against a brain tumour\non 1 February and died at the\nage of 37, leaving a wife and\ntwo children.\nThe journalist had been\nregularly, and openly, writing\nabout his experiences in his\nTumour Diary column on the\nBBC website, which attracted\nthousands of followers.\nTributes have been paid on\nthe BBC site from colleagues\nand readers as well as in the\nHouse of Commons, where a\nmotion speaking of \u2018admiration for his courageous fight\u2019\nwas signed by nine Liberal\nDemocrat MPs.\nNoble, who initially worked\nfor the BBC as a translator before joining the news\nwebsite in 2001, was diagnosed with a tumour in\nAugust 2002. He began the\nTumour Diary in September\n2002 in order to demystify\ncancer and encourage open\ndiscussion about the disease.\nDuring the two years he\nwrote the column, Noble\nunderwent three brain oper-ations, radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy. On a happier\nnote, he also got married and\nhad a second child, born last\nJuly.\nAfter each of his 66 entries,\nmany readers\u2019 comments\nwere posted, a large number\nof them thanking him for\nhis openness and for helping them come to terms with\ntheir own cancer or that of\na relative. Medical students\nand nurses also posted messages stating that Noble enabled them to understand the\nexperiences of cancer suf-ferers, aiding their ability to\ntreat patients.\nTributes from friends\ndescribed Noble\u2019s refusal to\nsurrender to fear. In his last\nentry, posted on 30 January,\nhe said he wanted the diary to\nshow people that they didn\u2019t\nhave to be crushed by cancer.\nAlthough he knew the cancer\nwould kill him, his last entry\nbore the phrase \u201cI have not\nbeen defeated.\u201d\nHe also thanked all who had\nsupported him: his friends,\nfamily, the medical staff and\nMacmillan nurse who treated\nhim since his diagnosis.\nA collection of his diaries\nwill be published later this\nyear and proceeds will go to\ncharity.\nTribute to Ivan Noble, BBC tumour diarist\nPlant biotech goes\nopen-source\nA team of scientists has developed an \u2018open-source\u2019 alternative to one of the most effec-tive, but patent-protected,\nways of genetically modifying\nplants. Until now, scientists\nhad to pay for licences to use\nAgrobacterium, which was\nthought to be the only bacterium capable of transferring\nforeign genes into plants. New\nresearch published in Nature\nreveals that other bacteria\ncan carry out gene transfer,\na development which could\nallow scientists to avoid the\npatent licencing process that\nstifles innovation.\nCall for \u00a3100m UK\nstem cell fund\nLeading UK scientists and\nentrepreneurs are calling for\nthe creation of a charitable\nfoundation to promote and\nfund stem cell research in\nBritain. They believe this will\naccelerate work on developing\nnew therapies for treating spinal injuries and diseases such\nas diabetes and Parkinson\u2019s.\nThe group believes a fund of\n\u00a3100m would be necessary to\nanchor the UK\u2019s position as a\nleader in the field.\nGenetic barcodes\nfor world\u2019s species\nA team of scientists has\nlaunched an ambitious project\nto genetically identify and\nprovide a barcode for every\nplant and animal species on\nthe planet. By taking a snippet of DNA from all the known\nspecies on Earth and linking\nthem to photographs, descriptions and scientific informa-tion, the researchers plan to\nbuild the largest database of\nits kind. Less than one fifth\nof the Earth\u2019s estimated ten\nmillion species of plants and\nanimals have been named.\nMonkeys pay for\nmonkey porn\nScientists at Duke University\nMedical Centre have found\nthat male monkeys pay to\ncheck out the behinds of\nfemale monkeys on a com-puter. The scientists also\nfound out that the apes would\npay extra fruit juice rations\nto see the faces of monkey\n\u2018celebrities\u2019.

Pre-race entry\nnumbers from internal teams\nwere high, and you could\nsense the buzz around campus leading up to Saturday.\nThe question now was how\nto make this race one of the\nmost memorable ever for the\nnew competitors. We wanted\nit to be remembered by eve-ryone, both individually and\nas a team thing. The latter\nwas easy \u2013 the camaraderie\nthat is produced year in, year\nout by each team is unmistakably obvious and so we did not\nneed to concentrate on that\ntoo much. The former was\na bit more difficult. Meeting\nafter meeting was held until\nwe decided there was only\none way to make the race different for each runner \u2013 the\nweather!\nWhatever the competitors\nthought, it was careful planning that made the weather\nfor each leg\u2019s runner vary so\nmuch. Using the proven Sod\u2019s\nLaw Formula of pre-start glorious sunshine to post-start\nlight drizzle, with strong\nwinds, heavy rain, hail and\nall other weather conditions\nin between, the committee\nbelieved we truly made the\nrace unique. It was great to\nsee the competitors waiting\nfor their legs dashing backwards and forwards from the\nDell Caf\u00e9, trying to get some\nprotection from the weather.\nThen, to finally complete the\nSod\u2019s Law Formula, when the\nvery last runner crossed the\nfinish line we organised for\nthe sun to come out again.\nSome committees are just\nborn with these preparation\nskills!\nSaturday may have been\nthe day of the 57th Hyde\nPark Relays, but for the HPR\nCommittee it all began the\nWednesday before, when 50\ncrazy Polish students arrived\nand took over Southside Gym.\nThe foreign invasion continued throughout the days\nleading up to the event, with\nthe Dutch, Italian, German,\nFrench, Welsh and Irish\narriving and crashing all\nover the university. Various\nmembers of the committee\nhad the \u2018pleasure\u2019 of sleeping\nover with the teams \u2013 well,\n\u2018sleeping\u2019 is probably the\nwrong word to use, seeing as\na sleeping bag was the only\ncushion against the hard,\ncold wooden floor. However,\nthe card games, sleeping bag\nraces and, of course, ridiculous amount of drinking in\nSouthside Bar and the Union\ncontributed to the friendly\natmosphere (and headaches)\nof the competitors.\nWhen Saturday morning\ncame and the HPR committee was rudely awakened by\nthe sound of their alarms\n(some as early as six in the\nmorning), race day preparations began with setting up\nthe race course, the JCR and\nthe Union, picking up the food\nand drinking lots of strong\ncoffee.\nAt around 10.30am, the first\ncompetitors came to register,\nand at 2pm the men\u2019s/mixed\nrace began to a huge cheering crowd. Five minutes later\nthe women\u2019s race started.\nFrank Horwill, the University\nof London coach, kindly started both races to a rapturous\napplause. Meanwhile, behind\nthe scenes, the committee were cutting the bread,\nmaking the soup (not surprisingly very popular, especially amongst the marshals\nafter the race, who had been\nstanding in the same place\nfor around three hours) and\nsorting out the race t-shirts.\nAfter the race had finished\nand the course signs were collected in, competitors headed\nover to the JCR for some\nafter-race food and the pres-entation. The men\u2019s/mixed\nrace was won by \u2018Goldsmith\u2019s\nPast and Present\u2019, a guest\nHyde Park Relays: more\nHYDE PARK RELAYS\nTop row, left to right: hundreds of competitors register for the 2005 Hyde Park Relays in dBs on Saturday morning; the men\u2019s race gets underway; the women\u2019s race follows soon after;\nand the Beit Hall and EEE teams pose for the camera.

Indeed, even\nthe Swiss national coach shed\na tear of joy as he witnessed\nsuch exquisite style and\npoise.\nIn a head to head ImperialZurich final, all was at stake;\nZurich apparent masters\nof modern sport, with their\nalpine fitness, snow sport\nheritage and national coach\nagainst Imperial, by far the\nmost intelligent, but lacking\nthe athletic edge and still\ngetting used to the fact that\nmore snow had fallen here in\nthe last 24 hours than in 24\nyears back in England.\nOff they went and at the\ntop of the hill, incredibly,\nImperial were ahead. But\nsoon Zurich managed to pull\nacross in front of us, leaving\nno option but to ram them\noff the course. However, they\nturned the corner before we\nreached them, but what a bad\ncorner it was for them. They\nhit the inside post and, once\nagain, Imperial went around\nthe outside. We were about\none foot down side by side\nas we rammed them prop-erly. Soren wisely pulled\nback their sledge and they\ntried to push away from us.\nBy the final corner, Zurich\nwere clearly going to win,\nuntil Gavin dived on one of\ntheir players and pulled him\nand the sledge back. Imperial\nwent past them and onto the\nlog before Zurich started to\nattack our sledge. After a\ncouple of minutes of fight-ing, Zurich were in trouble,\ntheir sledge upturned, their\nlead girl on her back and the\nthree guys being pulled off\nour sledge. Imperial were just\nseconds from a glorious victory when the officials declared\nthe event a draw.\nTo be honest, though, it\nwas proud finish and lifted\nthe name of Imperial on high.\nDespite coming last overall in\nthe tournament, the Imperial\nteam did themselves justice.\nLiving in London means that\nwe never see snow and this\nyear has been tough on our\nsports facilities. The badminton team have to play in the\nGreat Hall, the basketball\nteam play in Brixton and the\nwaterpolo team only have a\n20m paddling pool at their\ndisposal. In these training\nconditions, the skill and courage that our teams displayed\nwas exemplary!\nIt was with this sense of\nachievement that we spent\nour remaining days enjoying some of the best snow in\nthe world this season, forging relationships not only\nwith the other universities,\nbut also amongst ourselves.\nSpecial thanks must go to\nETH Zurich for putting on\nsuch a great event and especially the snow sports day,\nwhere we partied to cheesy\nmusic and got to experience\nskiing, snowboarding, air\nboards, snow skates and snow\nbikes before being escorted\nby cable car to the mountaintop restaurant for fondue\nmadness and prizes.\nI\u2019d also like to thank Neil\nMosely and Grant Danskine of\nthe College Sport and Leisure\nDepartment for organising the Imperial teams and\nfunding the cost of getting\nthere. They were a pleasure\nto work with (and drink with!)\nalthough if I never have to\nhear Grant snore again I shall\ndie a happy man.\nI\u2019d like to congratulate the\noverall tournament winner\nJonas Emmanuel Trecenti\nGomes, 24, the goalkeeper in\nwaterpolo for ETH Zurich. As\na truly international student\nhe received the big cowbell\nfor the ETH team; he was\nborn in Brazil, did an internship at RWTH Aachen, and\nis now studying Mechanical\nEngineering at ETH. I hope\nthat some of our competitors take up the opportunity\nto continue studying at these\ninstitutions once they finish at\nImperial, although they had\nbetter not compete against us\nif they do.\nFinally I\u2019d like to thank\nour competitors, who proved\nthemselves to be true ambassadors of Imperial College.\nIf you would like to know\nmore about getting involved\nin sport at Imperial and possibly joining any of Imperial\nCollege Union\u2019s 60+ sports\nclubs, please get in touch\nwith Richard Walker, the\nDeputy President (Clubs and\nSocieties) at dpcs@ic.ac.uk.\nImperial waterpolo player Tim Keating with the ball\nThe victorious Imperial College sledging team\n\n"

Still, according to one person familiar\nwith the bank, Mr Varley has\nbroached the idea of buying\nUS consumer finance companies and, on the flip side, the\nbank is often mentioned as a\npossible target for a large US\nacquirer.\nMr Varley declined to comment on specific speculation,\nsaying: \u201cA takeover is really\nthe furthest thing from my\nmind.\u201d\nBarclays said net profit\nrose from \u00a32.77bn in 2003\nto \u00a33.31bn in 2004, and that\nits investment bank posted a\n25% increase in profit from\n2003.\nBarclays also got a big boost\nfrom a decrease in bad loan\nprovisions, which analysts do\nnot view as a sustainable way\nto increase profit. Barclays\nreported a 19% drop in 2004\nprovisions for bad debts to\n\u00a31.1bn from \u00a31.3bn in 2003.\nStill, those results mirrored\nthe actions taken by some US\nbanks in a sign of an improving economy.\nBarclays\u2019 shares slipped\n0.08% to 593.5 pence in London\ntrading on Thursday.\nBarclays\u2019 UK retail bank\noperations reported a\ndecrease of almost 1% in\nprofit from \u00a31.14bn to \u00a31.13bn.\nOne reason for this is the\nbank\u2019s increased spending\non employees\u2019 salaries after\ncomparatively underpaying them, according to ana-lysts, and an effort to renovate some branches. In 2004,\nBarclays said it added 1000\nemployees who deal directly\nwith customers.\nThe percentage rate at\nwhich the bank\u2019s costs rose\nalso surprised analysts.\nOperating expenses rose\n15% from \u00a37.25bn to \u00a38.35bn.\nMichael Lever, an analyst at\nCredit Suisse First Boston,\nsaid analysts and investors\nhad expected costs to rise\n13%.\nWhile Barclays Capital,\nthe investment banking unit,\nhelped increase profit, it also\nreported a 37% increase in\ncosts to \u00a32.2bn in 2004. The\nunit under CEO Bob Diamond\nhas been on an aggressive\npush that included the addition of 2000 employees last\nyear in an effort to improve\nits rankings in such areas as\nEuropean debt issuances.\nSeparately, Mr Diamond\nsaid, there remains the possibility that Barclays will settle\na court case with Germany\u2019s\nHSH Nordbank. HSH\nhas alleged that Barclays\ndeceived it in a derivatives\ntrade. A court hearing is\nscheduled for later this\nmonth.\nBarclays has declined to\ncomment on the allegation\nbeyond saying that the losses\nsuffered by HSH were the\nresult of a sizable downturn\nin the credit market.\nDeutsche Bank\nDeutsche Bank AG might be\nlooking to sell the UK division of its global funds management arm as part of the\nGerman bank\u2019s shake-up of\nits UK institutional business,\nfollowing big outflows last\nyear.\nThe company\u2019s official position is that it is considering all\noptions for the UK division of\nDeutsche Asset Management.\nHowever, Deutsche Bank\nChief Executive, Josef\nAckermann, said this month\nthat if the UK business can\u2019t\nbe fixed, Deutsche Bank may\nput it on the market.\nDeutsche Asset Management operates a number of\nvehicles in the UK, with a\ntotal of 78.5bn euros of assets\nunder management. Globally,\nit has a total of \u00a3400bn (580bn\neuros) under management,\nand real-estate makes up\n7.5% of these assets, according to real-estate advisory\nfirm Cushman & Wakefield,\nHealey & Baker.\nA sale on this scale would be\na big deal for the UK market,\nAndrew Thornton, joint managing director for European\nReal Estate at Invesco Real\nEstate in London, said.\n\u201cTypically you would expect\nthe usual suspects \u2013 the\nMorgan Stanleys and Merrill\nLynches of this world \u2013 to be\ninterested. Insurance companies are also diversifying\nmore into asset management,\nso the funds could also appeal\nto them.\u201d Mr Thornton said.\nDeutsche Asset Management has been hit by an outflow of funds, especially in\nthe 2004 fourth quarter, when\ninvestors withdrew 20bn\neuros, most of which came\nfrom the UK.\nDeutsche Asset Managementoutflowslastyeartotaled\n44bn euros world-wide. While\nthe company declined to provide figures on a country-by-country basis, a spokesperson said that the UK outflows\nwere \u201chigher than normal.\u201d\nShe declined to give further\ndetails.\nAs a result of the outflows,\nthe German bank is conducting a review of its institutional\nbusiness in the UK and plans\nto announce the outcome of\nthe review by the beginning of\nthe second quarter.\nKevin Parker, who became\nthe global head of asset management at Deutsche Asset\nManagement in December,\nsuggested the review of the\nUK business. Deutsche Asset\nManagement also has offices\nin 10 other European cities,\nincluding Frankfurt, Zurich\nand Paris; however, none of\nthese operations is under\nreview, a Deutsche Bank\nspokeswoman said.\nIf Deutsche Bank does\ndecide to sell its UK asset-management division, potential bidders might include\ninvestment banks such as\nMorgan Stanley and UK\nlife-insurance funds, Bryan\nLaxton, head of advisory services at Cushman & Wakefield,\nHealy & Baker in London,\nsaid.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think investors\nwould object to the individual\nvehicles being sold to another\nhigh-profile company as long\nas the team that managed\nthem,especiallythefundman-agers, were part of the deal. It\nwould make more sense to\nsell all the Deutsche Asset\nManagement vehicles as one\npackage, to take advantage of\nthe synergies, rather than to\nsell the vehicles on an individual basis,\u201d Mr Laxton said.\nHe noted that Deutsche\nBank might sell the funds\npiecemeal if investors show\ninterest in snapping up vehicles to complement their\nexisting funds.\nDeutsche Bank is embarking on a cost-cutting program\nto meet its goal of raising its\nreturn on equity to 25% by\nthe end of 2005, up from 17%\nin 2004. The bank said this\nmonth that it will cut 6,400\nfull-time jobs. However, 1,200\nof these will be transferred\nto lower-cost locations, resulting in a net reduction of 5,200\nstaff. The bank said expenses\nrelated to the job cuts and\nother efficiency measures are\nexpected to total about 1.3bn\neuros for 2005 and the fourth\nquarter of 2004.\nThe bank is also expected\nto sell more real-estate assets\nthis year, following its drive\nto dispose of these assets\nin the past few years. In\nDecember, it sold a portfolio\nof 109 buildings in Germany to\nEurocastle Investment Ltd.,\nan investment company managed by US investor Fortress\nInvestment Group LLC, for\nabout 300m euros. The bank,\nwhich occupies the majority of the properties, plans to\nlease back many of them.\nElsewhere in Europe, one\nof the biggest real-estate\nsales in German history is in\nthe final stages, according to\nthose who track the market.\nGerman utility E.On AG\u2019s\nsale of its real-estate unit\nViterra, which owns about\n150,000 apartments, is expected to be completed within\nweeks as part of E.On\u2019s drive\nto focus on its energy business and sell off non-core\nassets. Real-estate advisers\nestimate that E.On could\ngain about 6bn euros from\nthe Viterra sale. Investor\nFortress Investment Group\nLLC, which declined to com-ment, is believed to be the\nmain contender. Other likely\npotential buyers include USbased investors Blackstone\nGroup and Cerberus Partners\nand UK-based investor Terra\nFirma Capital Partners Ltd.\nUS investor Lone Star, who\ncouldn\u2019t be reached for com-ment, is not thought to have\na bid.\nBarclays Plc: doing extremely well and with strong prospects ahead\n\n"

There was\na large amount of random\nstrangeness and insanity\nfrom all those who took part,\nraising thousands of pounds\nfor Cancer Research UK and\nthe Mercury Phoenix AIDS\nTrust.\nMonday morning saw the\nRAG team surface bright and\nearly to collect at the gates\nduring the big rush to 9am\nlectures. At lunchtime, the\nPhysical Sciences Union sold\nKrispy Kreme doughnuts on\nthe walkway outside the JCR.\nDespite ample supplies, these\nall sold out, making a sizeable\ncontribution to RAG funds.\nBeside the doughnut stall\nwere Zaki Nuseibeh and John\nCollins playing an upright\npiano. RAG legend Atul Rana\nthen appeared with his guitar\nand a lively jamming session\nfollowed, including an inimitable version of the Louis\nArmstrong classic Wonderful\nWorld. Those who heard it\nwill surely never forget it, and\nneither will their therapists.\nThe icing on the doughnut,\nso to speak, was provided by\nan election campaigner handing out tins of beans, adding\nto the carnival atmosphere\nso rarely seen at Imperial\nCollege.\nTo celebrate Shrove\nTuesday, a pancake race was\nheld. This involved running\naround Beit Quad collecting\nthe ingredients for the batter\nin a skiff before limboing and\nslaloming, trying not to spill\nthe mix. The mess left in the\nQuad was unbelievable but\nwas eventually dealt with by a\nheavy rain shower. Needless\nto say, few of the pancakes\nwere considered edible,\nexcept for one near-perfect\noffering from the winner of\nthis slightly bizarre event,\nHamish Pearse-Danker.\nIn line with RAG tradition,\nthe raid on London took place\non the Wednesday. A slightly\ndisappointing turnout saw a\nhardcore elite of participants\nraise over \u00a31400 by running\naround London doing pretty\nmuch anything they could\nthink of, including swimming in Trafalgar Square and\nstealing policemen\u2019s helmets.\nI don\u2019t want to go into too\nmuch detail here, just in case\nthe Old Bill ever catch up\nwith me.\nOn Thursday, a City and\nGuilds bar night was combined with a slave auction to\nattract the punters. A wide\nrange of Union celebrities\nwere auctioned off, raising well over \u00a31000. Several\nunfortunate students left the\nauction considerably balder than before, as buyers\nbecame more interested in\nshaving people\u2019s heads for\ncharity than actually purchasing \u2018slaves\u2019.\nAt around 11.30pm, as the\nnight drew to a close, a joint\nbid of \u00a3280 resulted in City\nand Guilds President John\nCollins and Royal School\nof Mines President John\nSykes embarking on the traditional \u2018Harrods run\u2019.

Unlike\nsome other high profile jocks, he\nhasn\u2019t lost his edge or his skill.\nCheck out his recent mix, Fabric 20\n(see review in Felix 1312), and you\u2019ll\nsee what I mean.\nThe night and CD release were\nprobably timed to coincide, but this\nwas always going to be a big night\ndue to Digweed\u2019s status. Lucky, then,\nthat my group all avoided the scarily\nlarge queue and went straight in.\nEven luckier that we were allowed\ninto the VIP area (the balcony over\nroom one) and luckier still that one\nof my friends had decided to pay for\nus to have our own exclusive table in\nsaid VIP area. When Fabric gets this\nfull, there is often nowhere to chill,\nbut we had a nice area with a sofa,\nand the music still sounded great\nfrom there.\nPreceding Digweed was Pete\nMoss, whose Strive to Live is, inci-dentally, track one on Fabric 20.\nMoss set the scene perfectly for\nthe big man, with smooth yet driving tunes and the occasional bit\nof bouncy bass-led fun. When we\nfirst arrived the crowd was already\npumped, cheering and screaming to\nthe breakdowns, and the dancefloor\nin room one was pretty packed.\nAt 2am, the break in the music\nand the almost deafening roar of\nthe crowd signified Mr D\u2019s arrival\nin the booth. The atmosphere was\nelectric with anticipation; everyone\nhad been waiting for this, and we\nwere all ready.\nDigweed began his set with low-intensity, dreamy-sounding tracks,\nand the noise died down as everyone\ngot back to what they came here to\ndo: dance. We spent the night flitting\nbetween our table, the dancefloor\nand the stairs: the floor being very\ncrowded, the table being too far from\nthe action and the stairs, as ever,\nbeing a great place to sit amongst\nsome randoms, have a smoke and\nwatch endless streams of people\nwalk up and down past you.\nOne way or another, we were\nlocked into Digweed\u2019s sound all\nnight. When you go and hear a prog\nDJ, its very easy to get lost in the\nmusic and just be carried by it. This\nwas exactly what happened. The\nstyle of the music really precludes\ntune-spotting, but it was bloody\namazing all night.\nThe sounds this guy finds and the\nway he presents them results in\na beautiful layered progression of\nsounds, each one grabbing a different part of you. Delicious. To add\nto the fun, as everyone (including\nDigweed himself) says, the sound\nsystem in Fabric is divine and perfectly suited to this kind of music.\nBasslines are warm and envelop you\nwherever you are in the room, the\nmidrange is punchy and slaps you\nround the face, and the highs spin\naround the room above your head.\nFabric closes officially at 7am, but\nthey have a 24 hour licence (you can\nsee it when you queue for the cloak-room) and Digweed played on. God\nknows how long for; we were partied\nout and left shortly after.\nPlease, take my advice: there\u2019s\nno question of whether or not you\nshould see Digweed, the question\nis when.\nSimon Clark\nNightlife Editor\nDigweed delivers\nFabric has the size, the reputation, and pulls some of\nthe best DJs around. Tonight, it was John Digweed\nBryan Gee: Sub Red Headliner\nFabric\nFabric, Charterhouse Street\nHHHHH\nNightlife clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\nDigweed. \u2018Nuff said\nSub Red @ Imperial College Union\nPREVIEW\nICU\u2019s popular drum and bass night,\nSub Red, is back this Friday, 18\nFebrurary with guest DJ Bryan Gee\nand the Union\u2019s own MacPherson,\nas well as IC Radio\u2019s Spindle and\nChug.\nIt\u2019s halfway through term, so if\nyou\u2019re anything like me, the purse\nstrings will already be tightening.\nDon\u2019t despair though, since ICU is\nonce again bringing you another\ntop night of drum and bass DJs and\ncheap drinks.\nSub Red is one of the best nights\nheld at the Union, previously attracting such famous names as Nicky\nBlackmarket and Ray Keith. At the\ntop of the bill this time is Bryan\nGee, accompanied by MacPherson\n(the Union\u2019s Venue Manager, who\ncan also be seen playing at super-club Fabric). Spindle and Chug\nmade a name for themselves with\ntheir Basement Sessions show on\nIC Radio and are now taking dance-floors by storm.\nBryan Gee is a key figure in the\ndrum and bass scene. Through the\nlabel V Recordings, he and Jumpin\u2019\nJack Frost have been releasing\nmaterial by a whole string of big\nnames, including Roni Size, DJ Die,\nRay Keith and DJ Marky & XRS to\nname a few.\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough to whet\nyour appetite, there\u2019s also an offer\non drinks: vodka with mixer is only\n\u00a31. Once the dancefloor is full of\nweary students working off the\nweek\u2019s worries, the turbosound PA\nis pumping and the light show is in\nfull effect, dBs can easily rival any\nvenue of it\u2019s size.\nThe DJs, the sound and lights and\nthe (cheap) bar are all there. All\nthat\u2019s missing is the vibe, and that\u2019s\ndown to you. Come along, have some\nfun and make some noise!\nJust before you groan: \u201cUrgh,\nbut it\u2019s the Union,\u201d take a moment\nto reflect on what\u2019s on offer here:\nan impressive line-up of first class,\nprofessional DJs, cheap entry\n(try getting into any halfway\ndecent club in London on a Friday\nfor less than a tenner) and cheap\ndrinks, all in the comfort and familiar surroundings of your very own\nUnion.\nFelix will be down there to check\nout the action: look out for a review\nnext week. So get yourself down to\nthe Union this Friday, and you might\njust get yourself in the paper!\nSimon Clark\nSub Red\nICU\n\u00a33 (\u00a33.50 Guests/\u00a32.50 Ents Card)\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 17 February 2005 17\nAtomic Mass\nNo, not in a physics way. In a full-on-party-in-a-church way. Honest\nCLUB REVIEW\nThe venue of a club is one of the most\nimportant factors for me in choosing\na night out. Some are tiny, friendly,\nand intimate. Others are vast arenas\nwith towering speaker stacks and\nscreaming crowds of thousands that\nare easy to lose yourself in. Many\nare converted theatres with balconies providing amazing panoramas\nof the rave scene below.\nMass providesthemostinteresting\nvenue of all: it is situated in a church.\nNow, I\u2019ve seen the conversion of disused churches into venues to great\neffect (speakers hanging from stone\npillars, walls adorned with memorial\nplaques), but the difference here is\nthat the home of Mass, St Matthew\u2019s\nChurch in Brixton, is still in full and\nactive use.\nLet me explain a little more. St\nMatthews is really quite a huge, relatively modern building that is divided into many different regions and\nrooms, some of which are used for\nreligious worship, others for entertainment (the Bug Bar is also here,\nin the crypt). Lucky, really:meet-ing the congregation on the way\nhome from Saturday night\u2019s frolics\nwouldn\u2019t really be my perfect end to\na party.\nAtomic Energy is one of those\nnights that is held with vague regu-larity: there\u2019s about one every three\nmonths. It\u2019s the kind of party that\npeople make the effort to get to, and\ntonight was Atomic Energy\u2019s sixth\nbirthday. With three rooms, but only\ntwo DJ line ups, the flyer promised\n\u2018London\u2019s Finest Hardbeat Energy\nin Two Rooms\u2019 from the likes of\nCaptain Tinrib, Kevin Energy and\nGroup 185, as well as a third room\nof \u2018Psychadelic Energy\u2019. Energy all\nround, then.\nThe Mass has three rooms, two\nof which are on the same level and\nand the third is far below, down a\nlong spiral staircase. At the bottom\nand top of this staircase is where\nyou enter and where you\u2019ll find the\ncloakroom and toilets respectively.\nThe top two rooms were home to the\ncrisscrossed main line-up, whilst the\npsy was downstairs, which is also\nknown as \u20183rd Base\u2019.\nThe music tonight, as you might\nhave guessed, was fast, hard and\nbouncy. I\u2019m not sure who I saw and\nwhen, but it was all very, very good.\nThe place wasn\u2019t ram jammed, but\nit was pretty full in the upstairs\nrooms. The bigger of the two had a\nkind of upper section, with a lowered\ndancefloor in the middle in front of\nwhich was the stage. The sounds\nhere were twisted and fast, with a\nvery nice acidic edge. When I was\nhere there were some crazy dread-locked cybers on stage providing the\nsounds.\nIn the other upstairs room, I saw\nCaptain Tinrib, genius of the Tinrib\nlabel. Those with a penchant for\nhard house should know the name:\nit\u2019s synonymous with fast but fun\npumping music. You might think this\nsort of thing is all drum rolls and\nhoover noises, and whilst those are\nimportant elements, there\u2019s a lot\nmore in store for your ears if you\u2019re\nwilling to listen for a bit. Appearing\non stage with a live percussionist,\nthe Captain was awesome.\nDownstairs in the psy room, there\nweren\u2019t really many people at any\npoint. This was fine though, since\nit leaves lots of room for flailing\naround the floor. Maybe the music\nwasn\u2019t as intense and driving as I\nlike, but it was still, as the flyer had\nsuggested, full of energy.\nThis was really quite a good night\nout, aside from the 5000 flyers I was\nloaded up with on our way out.\nSimon Clark\nAtomic Energy\nMass, St Matthews Church, Brixton\nHHHII\nFile under:\nHard house, psy trance\nIf you like this, try:\nKnowwhere @ The Fridge\nFile under:\nProgressive house\nIf you like this, try:\nRenaissance @ The Cross\n\n"

Reading\nanything up on the walkway can\nbe a bit of a hit and miss affair,\nespecially when you\u2019re trying to get\nsomewhere, so let us fill in the gaps\nand tell you about this year\u2019s arts\nfestival.\nWe all know that we attend an art\nstudent-free college; we have a reputation for being nerds and science\ngeeks. Some of that reputation is\nprobably richly deserved and treasured by some parties, but we are\nnot lacking in creativity! The arts\nfestival exists to showcase the wide\nrange of artistic talent throughout\nthe college.\nCleverly branded \u2018Arts Fest 2005\u2019,\nthis year\u2019s arts festival kicks off on\nSunday 20 February and will end\nwith a grand finale on the following Friday. Over 15 societies are\ntaking part this year, ranging from\nLeosoc to Capoeira and everything\nin between. Events are taking place\nthroughout the week and most are\nfree.\nThe festival kicks off on Sunday\nwith the medics\u2019 fashion show at the\nrenowned Sketch on Conduit Street.\n(If you messed up Valentine\u2019s Day,\nthis could be a good chance to make\namends. The venue is regularly\nvoted one of the most romantic in\ntown.) The show starts at 6.30pm.\nThroughout the week, there\nwill be an exhibition in the Blyth\ngallery, on the fifth floor of the\nSherfield building, and performances of Chess by Musical Theatre\nSociety in the Union Concert Hall in\nBeit Quad.\nThe exhibition will officially open at\n6.30pm on Monday 21 February, with\na concert by the Chamber Music\nSociety in the Read lecture theatre,\nalso on the fifth floor of Sherfield.\nThe concert, like the exhibition,\nwhich will be showcasing work by\nLeosoc and the Photography and\nOrigami societies, is free.\nChess [see Clubs and Societies,\npage 11] is a ticketed event, \u00a34.50\nfor students. For those of you not\nfamiliar with the musical, its story is\nbased around a love triangle caught\nup in the world chess championships between Russia and the United\nStates. It premiered in May 1986,\nand is the work of lyricist Tim Rice\nwith music by Benny Andersson and\nBjorn Ulvaeus.\nOther events taking place during\nthe week include an origami session on Monday lunchtime in the\nJCR. The Urban Music society will\nbe hosting a Heavy Elements night\nthat will feature live DJs and MCs\nfrom 8pm Monday in dBs.\nIf none of this is to your taste,\nthere is still a lot on offer that will\nhopefully satisfy you. On Tuesday\nevening, dBs will be the venue for\na Jazz and Rock gig night, and on\nThursday it will welcome the ever-popular Big Band.\nWednesday will be a very busy day.\nThe Dance Extravaganza will come\nto the JCR from 2 until 5.30pm. Those\nkeen to take part will be glad to\nknow that the Dance Extravaganza\nwill be your chance to try out capoe-ira, breakdancing, hip hop, latin and\nmore dance styles for free. In the\nevening, there will be a short concert in the Great Hall given by the\nChoir, Symphony Orchestra and Big\nBand. The concert is free, but you\nwill be asked to make a donation to\nthe Tsunami Relief Fund.\nThe festival wraps up on Friday\nwith the Finale concert in the Great\nHall at 7.30pm, with an after party\nat the Union. Tickets, \u00a32.50 for stu-dents, will be available throughout\nthe week at the ticket desk on the\nwalkway level of Sherfield. The concert will be the final glittering showcase of the wide breadth of artistic\ntalent at the college. The after party\nis free for those with a concert ticket and will feature Fabriclive\u2019s Joe\nRansom and \u00a31 pints. You can suffer\nfor your art, but there\u2019s no need to\nbe thirsty!\nMore information on the events\ntaking place during Arts Fest 2005 is\navailable on the website www.union.\nic.ac.uk/artsfest.

Patrick Stewart, eternally\nassociated with Star Trek and his\nrole as Jean-Luc Picard, also held a\ndegree of pulling power. It looked as\nthough the theatre had picked a win-ner: something for every (wo)man.\nBut who even cares what the play\nis about?\nIn case some people are interested in what these famous faces are\nup to on stage each night, the play\nis, in brief, a study of theatre life,\ndepicted through Robert (Stewart)\nand John (Jackson), old and young\nactors working together in a middle-of-the-road theatre company.\nIt\u2019s obvious that neither is going\nto make it big, but while John is at\nthe beginning of his career, aspiring\nto greatness, Robert has spent his\nlife in the theatre. Despite his lack\nof success, Robert obviously feels\nhis life could not have been spent\nelsewhere, and as his career wanes\nstill further, he takes to dispensing advice to his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in\nthe hope of revealing the inherent\npitfalls and soul-destroying tasks of\nsuch a life.\nInitially, John is reverent in his\nattention to his superior\u2019s words,\nbut slowly he gains confidence and\nloses faith in Robert, grasping for\nthe upper hand and belittling the\nolder man as it becomes clear he\nis not the mover and the shaker he\npurports to be.\nAll this sounds a little dry and\nperhaps more suited for an audience of theatre professionals better\nequipped to \u2018get\u2019 the insider jokes\nand references. However, the playwright David Mamet, himself an\nactor in his youth, attempts to steer\nclear of falling into that niche and\npresents a play which is very accessible and often very funny.\nPatrick Stewart masterfully portrays Robert\u2019s construed self-impor-tance, and Joshua Jackson functions\nwell as a cushion off which Robert\u2019s\ninconsequential advice and rambled\nproclamations bounce and tumble.\nThe play consists of short scenes\nof the two actors performing together and then returning backstage to\ntheir tiny shared dressing room to\ndissect the state of affairs. The \u2018onstage\u2019 scenes are often very funny,\nwith neither \u2018actor\u2019 exhibiting much\nskill.\nAs the play progresses, Robert\nloses grip on himself, performing more comically and becoming\nwracked with an amusing self-doubt.\nJohn gains in confidence, though\nnot in skill, and revels in villifying\nthe older man.\nCouched in all this humour is a\ntouching tale of the shifting dynamics between these two men at different stages of their lives. One\nexits the theatre a little moved and\nperhaps more enlightened over the\nplight of the many men and women\nin theatres up and down the country\nand beyond.\nPatrick Stewart and Joshua\nJackson, the undisputable draws of\nthe play, do deliver. Both show themselves to be surprisingly competent\ncomic actors and do their best to\ngive some returns on the ticket\u2019s\nhefty price-tag.\nHowever, despite a running time\nof less than 90 minutes, this performance drags. While chuckles are\nfreely given and deserved, there is\nnot enough meat in the play to properly satisfy. While Mamet does avoid\ncreating a play with no relevance for\nthe general public, he does not succeed in creating a play that is fully\ngratifying for this public. By the end,\nthe jokes elicit, at best, a smirk. One\nbegins to lose compassion for the\nfumbling Robert, and even Joshua\nJackson in his underpants fails to\nretain one\u2019s attention.\nIn short, Patrick Stewart and\nJoshua Jackson are indeed the\ngreatest attractions of this produc-tion. It is just a shame that they\nwere not provided with better material with which to dazzle us once we\nhad bitten the bait.\n\u201cOver 15 societies\nhave taken part this\nyear, from Leosoc to\nCapoeira and everything in between\u201d\nA Life in the Theatre\nApollo Theatre,\nShaftesbury Avenue, WC2\nWritten by David Mamet\nDirected by Lindsay Posner\nTickets \u00a317.50 for under 26s\n(actual value \u00a340)\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 17 February 2005 19\n\u201cEven Joshua\nJackson in his\nunderpants fails to\nretain one\u2019s attention\u201d\nA life beyond television\nLynsey McInnes enjoys a good performance of mediocre material by Pacey and Jean-Luc\nOur protagonists contemplate the operation of the household\nappliance known as the \u2018telephone\u2019\n\n"

A good number of\n\u2018competitors\u2019 turned up, but\nthe wherabouts of many of\nthem remains unknown. One\nmade it Canterbury following\na very long walk.

For those of you\nstill unsure about whether to\ngo or not, let me enlighten\nyou.\nFirstly, it\u2019s a ball and tickets\nare only a tenner. Just \u00a310\nfor a whole ball! Because of\nvery generous support from\na number of companies, and\nthe hard work and determination of medics and engineers from Imperial College,\nevery penny of your \u00a310 ticket\nprice will go straight to the\nongoing redevelopment work\nin the areas worst affected by\nthe tsunami.\nThis ball would normally\ncost thousands, but it has\neffectively been put on for\nfree!

Many observers were\npleased to note the relative\nlack of election-related complaints compared with previous years.\nSeveral theories have\nbeen put forward as to why\nthe turnout is so high this\nyear. The race for President\nbeing closely fought by five\ncandidates may well be a\nfactor, as could the blanket\ncoverage afforded to the elections by the student media.\nStudents\u2019 dissatisfaction\nwith certain College and\nUnion policies may also have\nencouraged them to have\ntheir say.\nThe sabbaticals are the\nmost senior student officers\nwithin the Union, and the high\nturnout should result in them\nbeing taken more seriously by\nthe College. Mustafa Arif, the\ncurrent President, said: \u201cThe\nhigher the turnout in the elec-tions, the more the Union\u2019s\nvoice is respected.\u201d\nResults are due to be\nannounced tonight and will be\npublished at www.felixonline.\nco.uk.\nClockwise from top left: Zaki Nuseibeh plays some tunes for passers-by outside the JCR; Sanjeev Sarda is the victim of\na particularly severe attack from the City and Guilds Hit Squad; Duncan Richmond presents Union President Mustafa\nArif with flowers on Valentine\u2019s Day; and the Barbershop Quartet serenade a mystery student during a maths lecture.\nAll these events were part of Imperial College Union RAG Week 2005\n\n"

We were ready\nto play our local rivals, the\nupstart ULU team. However,\nfacing the brave Devils was a\nULU squad suspiciously bolstered by the presence of at\nleast six players from their Ateam, including their regular\nA-team goaltender.\nDue to the pleasing number\nof female players on their\nside (and the lack of on ours\n(cheap advert)), the game\nwas limited to no contact.\nThe match started off well\nfor the Devils, as we dominated them while constantly\nprobing into their zone and\nfiring shots at will on the ULU\ngoal.\nUnfortunately ULU struck\nfirst, with a goal completely\nagainst the run of play. The\nDevils had around 80% of\nthe possession during the\nfirst period (though this figure grows every time we talk\nabout it), but despite our best\nefforts ULU scored again.\nTowards the end of the first\nperiod, it emerged that our\nstar goaltender Ruth was\ninjured and had to be urgently\nreplaced. Our reserve \u2018keeper\nCarolyne, who had been happily spectating without a care\nin the world, now had to step\nup to the challenge of her\nfirst real game. ULU took\nadvantage of this and got an\nearly goal in before she was\nwarmed up.\nIn the second period, the\nDevils started strongly\n(again), and our perseverance\nand vehemence led to a devilishly good strike from Sho to\nreduce their lead. Three-one.\nDespite this, it seemed that\nlady luck had deserted us, as\nalthough we had most of the\npossession, every mistake we\nmade was punished by an Ateam-led counter-attack (and\na few more goals).\nThe goals on both sides\nkept flying in, with Tom A\nscoring from a few centimetres out, and David proving\nthat we could actually score\na proper goal with a nutmeg of the goaltender. This\nprompted ULU to put on five\nA players at the same time, to\nprevent them from conceding\nany more.\nNear the end of the match,\nULU showed their frustration by hitting David into the\nboards from behind, after\nwhich Yingke stepped in and\ngot himself two minutes in\nthe box.\nThe final score was an\nundeserved 6-3 to the ULU B\nteam. And just to prove they\nfielded more A team players\nthan allowed, here\u2019s a snippet\nof an email from their mailing list: \u201cNote, in the future\nonly two A team players will\nbe allowed to ice.\u201d I guess\nthey really didn\u2019t want to lose.\nWhine over.\nIf you are interested in joining the ice hockey team, or\njust want to come and support\nus (anyone is welcome) then\nemail us at ice-hockey@ic.\nac.uk. We need players! Don\u2019t\nbe intimidated by the game\n\u2013 it\u2019s basically hockey on ice\n(imaginatively named) without the rain.\nICE HOCKEY\nDevils robbed!\nDancing devils?

    "content": "8 www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 17 February 2005\nBy Andy Brown\nSilwood Park correspondent\nLast Tuesday saw the intense\nUnion sabbatical election campaign pay a visit\nto Silwood Park, the smallest outlying campus of the\nImperial world. Around 30\npeople, many of whom were\npotential student representa-tives, arrived to attend our\ntermly union meeting, contributing to a turnout not seen\nat Silwood in many years.\nThe meeting was well\nunderway when the two\nminibuses arrived and people\nstarted emerging and stretching off the miles. Having then\nnavigated their way through\nthe maze that is the new card\naccess system, they politely sat at the back, listening\nintently to the issues we have,\nbeing so detached from what\noften seems like the rest of\nthe world, let alone Imperial\nCollege.\nOnce there was a timely\npause, Sam Rorke apologised\nfor being late with stories of\nhow they got lost four times.\nThis was rather ironic as\nwe have been trying to tell\nCollege how remote we are\nand how this remoteness is\na contributing factor to many\nissues Silwood Park students\nhave with their lives while\nstudying here.\nIt was when the debates\nmoved towards the catering\non site and, more important-ly, residences that the candidates at the back found their\nvoices and used the presence\nof the current Union president\nMustafa Arif as an opportunity to put forward their way\nof thinking if they were to be\nvoted into office for the next\nyear. One candidate pointed\nout that campuses such as\nSilwood and Wye, although\nmuch smaller than South\nKensington, could potentially be very influential in the\nelections if a low turnout was\nexperienced elsewhere.\nMuch debate was had over\nrent increases (Silwood having seen a 21% increase over\nthe last two years), inclusion\nof the telephone and internet into accommodation bills\nwith no opt-out available,\nand notice to quit deadlines\nmeaning a student leaving\nmid-term could potentially be\nlanded with a bill for many\nthousands of pounds. I personally find it hard to see how\nthe last two issues are in the\nbest interest of the students.\nThey could easily be seen as\na way of guaranteeing a certain amount of income from\naccommodation.\nFollowing the closing of the\nmeeting, candidates were led\npast the Union notice boards\nwhere, sellotape and blu tack\nin hand, they were officially\nallowed to place their post-ers. Posters appeared in\nevery colour of the rainbow\n(and then some more), some\nwith pictures from bad hair\ndays, and some personalised\nfor Silwood (a nice touch).\nUnfortunately, rules had to\nbe bent at this point, as we\nwere told that each candidate\nhad to place their posters at\nleast 6m apart - an interesting dilemma when the total\nlength of the one Union noticeboard on site is 4.23m.\nWith the closing of the\nmeeting, the job of raising our\nissues well done, and election material duly placed, the\ngroup then retreated to the\nbar, the centre of Silwood life\nas those biology and engineering students due to come out\nhere in a few months will see.\nIt\u2019s a cosy abode for many,\nwith a wooden bar and newly\npolished tables.\nThe campaigning here\nstarted with the handing out\nof flyers, promises of how\nthings should and would be\nchanged, and personalised\ntins of beans. This was followed by discussion amongst\nthe residents, who pulled\nthemselves away from the\nChinese New Year and pancake celebrations, about how\nSilwoodians, and more generally postgraduates, could be\nbetter represented.\nSome good ideas were put\nforward. I was impressed by\nthose who made an effort to\nput up posters and come and\ntalk to me, but disappointed\nby the turning down of my\noffer to vote for anyone who\nbrought me a pint from everyone bar Sam Rorke, who\nisn\u2019t even running for any-thing. Many later redeemed\nthemselves by opting not\nto go home early and stay\nfor the second minibus at\n11. They drank with us and\nconversation stayed vaguely\nrelated to the Union but did\ndeviate more and more with\nincreased flow of beer.\nAll in all we had a good\nnight \u2013 it was nice to be recognised by the Union, and\nwe are always happy to have\nthem out here. Here\u2019s to the\nhope that Silwoodians and\npostgraduates can continue\nthe advances made over this\nlast year.\nElection campaigning at Silwood\nAround Campus felix@ic.ac.uk\nCandidates and Deputy Returning Officer Sam Rorke (centre, with pint glass) talk to Silwood Park students as \u2018election season\u2019 gets into full swing\n\n"

Fresher\nAndy, playing at full back,\nwas excellent in support play\nand was always keeping our\ndefence tight.\nThe Wye pack dominated\nthe first half with great forward play and tactical possession rugby. Art Tukker and\nMike \u2018Hunt\u2019 West were always\non hand for a crash ball, while\nflankers Freddie and Henry\nwere awesome in open play,\npicking up loose ball and annihilating the Reading fly half.\nFresher Sam, Angus Doe,\nLeo and Adam from Essex\nensured we won our line-out\nas Art found his new role as\npart-time thrower.\nThe deadlock was broken\ntowards the end of the first\nhalf, when yet more forward\ningenuity allowed Henry to\nslide over for the first try. The\nhalf time whistle blew with\nthe Wye Boys yearning for\nmore as Reading skulked off\nthe pitch to lick their wounds.\nThe second half was a different story. We turned on our\nphysicality as Wye\u2019s superior\nfitness, strength and ability shone through. Trehane\nran like an ostrich through\nthe Reading defence, scoring two tries. A lovely switch\nmove orchestrated by Ando\nat fly half saw Paul Lau score\nunder the posts. Manos and\nGeorge were too pacy for\ntheir opposite numbers, both\nscoring some well-deserved\ntries, including a cheeky chip\nand chase from George. The\nblood bath continued as Ando\nscored in the corner, before\nslotting over some great conversions and missing two\nshockers.\nOverall it was a brilliant\nperformance from Wye, which\nReadingweresimplyunableto\nanswer. Special mention must\ngo to Adam from Essex, who,\nhooking for the first time, had\nan absolute stormer and was\nan easy choice for the man\nof the match award. Another\nspecial mention should go to\nAdam from Watford, whose\nblistering pace, usually associated with pikeyball, was put\nto good use on the wing. The\npack, led by our very own\nFlying Dutchman, put in a\nTrojan performance, out-pushing, out-jumping and for\nonce out-thinking the opposi-tion. The call for bail came\na bit too late for Reading as\nthey missed their players who\nwere on lockdown.\nPerhaps a redeeming feature of these convicts was\nthat they managed to knock\ndown an entire wall in our\nUnion. Let\u2019s just say the Wye\nBoys are looking forward to\nbeing let loose in Reading\nfor some proper agricultural\ndemolition!\nRUGBY\nConvicts\u2019 XV trounced\nHead of the Nene\nBy Ben Anstiss\nThere are some who would\nquestion the academic benefits of rowing, but, as I proved\nat the Southside pub quiz a\nfew weeks ago, it is invaluable.\nThe answer to the question\n\u201cThrough which major city\ndoes the river Nene flow?\u201d is,\nin fact, \u201cPeterborough\u201d (but\nmy team still came third).\nAnd that\u2019s where Imperial\nCollege Boat Club headed on\nSaturday 5 February, to compete at the Head of the Nene.\nThe competition was split\ninto three divisions: pairs/\nsingles, fours and eights,\nraced at different times during the day. The first two\ndivisions raced over a 2.5km\ncourse, with the third division (eights) traversing 4km.\nThese divisions were split\ninto categories of novice, senior and elite. Novice rowers\nare those who haven\u2019t won\nany regattas yet. Each regatta win earns one point, with\nsenior classes being numbered from 4 to 1, reflecting\nthe number of points allowed\nin each crew (paradoxically,\nthese numbers run in reverse\n\u2013 for example, senior 4 means\na maximum of one point per\nrower, senior 3 two points\netc). Elite is for those amazing people who win lots of\nraces.\nThree rowers were entered\nin the single sculls category,\nwith Ollie Mahony finishing\nsecond in open novice and\n14th overall, Helen Ellison\nwinning in the women\u2019s senior 2, and Sanna Supponen\ncoming fourth in the same\nrace just 19 seconds behind\nher. This event was run with\nthe doubles and pairs cat-egory, a total of 116 competing crews. Imperial took the\ntop four places in the open\nelite coxless pairs competition (which were also the\ntop three times overall), with\nfurther 1st, 3rd, 4th and 6th\nplaces in the senior 2 coxless\npairs.\nThe second division was\nfours, both coxed and coxless.\nImperial raced two coxed and\ntwo coxless men\u2019s fours and\none women\u2019s senior 3 coxed\nfour. The coxless fours, racing in the elite category, came\nfirst and second both in their\ncategory and overall, with\nonly eight seconds separating\nthem. The senior 2 coxed four\nwon their competition eas-ily, coming sixth overall. The\nsenior 3 coxed four came sec-ond, losing out by just seven\nseconds to the eventual win-ners, despite overtaking four\ncrews during their race and\nplacing 13th overall. The real\nsuccess story was the women\u2019s four, who not only came\nfirst in their category (21st\noverall) but also beat every\nother women\u2019s four, both\ncoxed and coxless in every\nother competition! It was a\ngreat result all round.\nThe third and final division\nwas the eights, an opportunity\nfor the novices and the senior\nwomen\u2019s squad to flaunt their\nstuff. The women\u2019s squad narrowly lost out on first place to\nNottingham University Boat\nClub by just four seconds,\nbut the result shows great\npromise for the upcoming\nWomen\u2019s Head of the River\nat the start of March. The\nmen\u2019s novice crews really\nstepped up to the challenge,\nwith the \u2018A\u2019 crew winning the\nopen novices by 22 seconds,\nand the \u2018B\u2019 crew less than\ntwo minutes behind, cox-box\nfailure notwithstanding!\nAfter some frantic de-rig-ging and boat loading (mainly\ninordertogetthetrainbackin\ntime for the England v Wales\nrugby match - the unfortunate\nresult needs no discussion), it\nwas back to London for cel-ebrations. It was also Andy\nHorsfall\u2019s birthday, meaning\nthat the alcohol flowed thick\nand fast, mainly in his direc-tion. Kudos to the angry little\nginger man, who managed\nto turn up to training at 8am\non Sunday morning. There\nare a few more races coming\nup this month, followed by\nthe huge Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s\nHead of the River races on\nthe Thames in March.\nROWING\n\u201cWhere the hell is the River Nene?\u201d\nImperial students on the Nene\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 62\nHolloway Men\u2019s 1st 61\nBy Robert Boland\nYou may have noticed in\nthe Results section of last\nweek\u2019s Felix that the men\u2019s\nbasketball team lost to Royal\nHolloway in the ULU league.\nThis is where we claim it was\nall part of the masterplan.\nHaving lost to them in the\nleague, the determination to\nbeat Holloway in the cup was\nstronger then ever. Playing\nthem only three days after\nlosing may not have given us\nmuch preparation time, but if\nthere\u2019s one thing you can say\nabout Imperial students, it\u2019s\nthat they learn fast.\nKnowing how they play,\nwe knew who he had to look\nout for and how they were\ngoing to attack us. Despite\nthe intensity we came out\nwith, they began knowing\nthey could beat us. In much\nthe same way as the match\nthe previous Friday, Holloway\nattacked and pushed us back.\nA disappointing score of 13-22\nat the end of the first quarter\nmeant we had to grit our teeth\nand start pushing forward.\nA clever tactical change\nfrom our coach gave us the\npush we needed. By changing\nto an adapted 3-2 zone, we\nstopped their shooters and it\nwas now up to us to make the\nmost of it. Our chances came\nand we should have been up\nentering half time, if only we\ncould finish them off. The\nshots weren\u2019t dropping for us.\nDespite this, we refused to let\nHolloway score and ended up\nwinning the quarter 10-6. Half\ntime score 23-28.\nEncouraged by the change\nin fortunes, we started the\nthird quarter with all guns\nblazing. Half time shooting\npractice seemed to have\nworked as the shots started\nto drop. Our defence held\nstrong despite improved\nefforts on their part. As\nthe bench and the support\nroared their encouragement,\nwe pushed forward and the\nquarter was a magnificent\ncontest. Winning it 25-17, we\nentered the last quarter with\na 3 point lead. One quarter\nto go and we would be in the\nsemi-finals!\nThe final quarter was as\ntense as you would imagine.\nBoth teams knew how important it was and gave it everything they had. Fouls flew\nin and three players ended\nup being fouled out of the\ngame. The teams exchanged\nbaskets for the duration of the\nquarter until it came down to\nthe last ten seconds of the\nmatch.\nThese ten seconds seemed\nto last a lifetime. The ball\nin our possession, Royal\nHolloway did what they had\nto and fouled us until they had\na chance to take the ball back.\nTheir chance did eventually\ncome, but with the strength\nof our defence they were left\nwith only one second to take\ntheir shot. An off-balance\nfadeaway just wasn\u2019t good\nenough and the men\u2019s \u2018second\u2019 team took home victory.\nIt was an incredible win,\nleaving the second team in the\nsemi-finals and two matches\naway from the trophy.\nWatch this space.\nBASKETBALL\nRevenge is sweet\n\n"

Here is the\nlist, as given on the BBC website,\nrating the searches starting at the\nmost popular: Britney Spears, Paris\nHilton, Christina Aguilera, Pamela\nAnderson, Chat, Games, Carmen\nElectra, Orlando Bloom, Harry\nPotter, mp3.\nYou will note that the top seven\nare clearly guys looking for naughty\npictures of ladies, chat rooms to\ntalk naughtily to ladies or games to\nwaste time.\nOrlando Bloom is the only entry\nthat may be due to ladies searching.\nThe problem with this being that\nthis statistic is entirely due to me \u2013 I\nhave a bit of an elf thing.\nBut wait, I hear you cry, these are\nthe global results, surely us Brits\nare much better than this! Well,\nyes we are. In the UK top searches\nof 2004, there was one noticeable\ndifference: in at number two was\n\u2018income tax returns\u2019. This means\nthat we are the same as the rest of\nthe world who all want to see pleasures of the flesh, except we have a\nslight accounting fetish too.\nRather oddly, in the French ver-sion, the third most popular search\nwas \u2018France\u2019. Trying to find yourselves on the map, eh?\nThose nice Google types even split\nthe results up into many smaller\nlists covering many different areas,\nfor instance the \u2018popular tech stuff\u2019\nhas as its top searches: Wallpaper,\nKazaa, mp3, Spybot, Linux.\nSince when is home decoration\n\u2018tech stuff\u2019? There is a good connection here though \u2013 people get\nKazaa, many of them will download mp3s from it, they realise they\nhave gallons of spyware, try to get\nrid of it using Spybot, and then eventually get so annoyed they install\nLinux. I can\u2019t think of any immediately obvious way to get from\nBritney to mp3 in a similar fashion\nthough.\nAs for the top ten searches conducted at Imperial College, sadly\nI could not get my hands on this\nvaluable data, but I\u2019m willing to bet\nmoney that \u2018pi to 27 decimal places\u2019\nis the most searched-for thing.\nSo what can we learn from this?\nGirls: there are lots of pictures\nof pretty men on the internet (I\nrecommend searching for \u2018fellatio\nfajitas\u2019 in Google). Guys: there\u2019s\nmore on the internet than pretty\nladies (I recommend \u2018fellatio fajitas\u2019\nagain).\nIn conclusion, there is a lot of\nwasted web space out there.\nNone more wasted than www.\nwastedwebspace.co.uk.\nby FELLATIO FAJITAS\nSeeing as there is no point in advocating Mac OS X to a die hard\nWindows user, even if it is better,\nmore stable and prettier, I thought\nI\u2019d write the partisan\u2019s guide.\nMac OS X\nWell you see this is easy. Whilst the\ncost for Apple hardware may initially be higher (in some rare cases),\nMac OS X is the company\u2019s real\ncost-cutter. You see, the long term\ncost of a Mac is considerably lower\nthan that of a PC. Why, you ask?\nWell, a Mac doesn\u2019t crash. A Mac\ndoesn\u2019t have viruses (at present).\nA Mac doesn\u2019t have spy-ware. But,\nmore importantly, it looks prettier\nand works better. The assumption\nthat it is a \u2018my first OS\u2019 is rubbish too. If you want to tinker, it is\nfar more customisable and malleable than Windows, due to its UNIX\ncore.\nApplescripts allow you to automate virtually anything, and with\nsystem-wide services allowing programs to use anything from spell-checks to image import, you can\nmake things as easy or as tricky as\nyou want, all without breaking the\ndamn thing. Plus it doesn\u2019t have\nrandom interfaces \u2013 all programs\nare standardised.\nBut if you\u2019re looking for the real\nkiller, for every delay that Microsoft\nannounce for Longhorn (wasn\u2019t\nthat meant to arrive in 1983?),\nApple introduce another OS version that incorporates features\nfrom Longhorn 2. Plus Apple doesn\u2019t\nsuck as much as Microsoft. They\ndon\u2019t decide randomly to make their\nweb-browser non-standards com-pliant. And they don\u2019t smell. But\nfrankly the best thing about Apple is\nthat their CEO has a sense of style\nand is so amazing he\u2019s managed\nto beat cancer without taking off\nhis trademark turtleneck (suck that,\nGates).\nWindows\nWindows eh? That\u2019s the rubbish\ngarbage that comes with your PC\nright? The thing you have to continually re-install if you hope to get\nany sort of performance out of it?\nThat\u2019s the one.\nThe good thing is, though, that\nfor some reason this doesn\u2019t affect\ngaming. In fact, it seems to positively encourage it \u2013 why else would\nanyone buy a \u00a32000 PC with flashing\nlights and demon head monitor?\nWindows isn\u2019t for family newsletters (Charles Manson excepted) or\nfor light email browsing. It\u2019s mostly\nnot even for video editing or pro-use.\nThat\u2019s what Macs are for. Gaming is\nthe raison d\u2019etre for PCs nowadays.\nAnd Windows is the base system\nof choice. As far as I can work out,\nthat\u2019s because it\u2019s cheap. Possibly.\nMarket dominance might have\nsomething to do with it as well, but I\nreckon it\u2019s because most people are\nstupid and lazy.\nLinux\nI don\u2019t actually know much about\nlinux, except that it\u2019s free. And it\u2019s\nloved by server-type people. And\npeople who don\u2019t like sunlight.\nApparently stable, and getting some\nvery good apps (most of which run\non Mac via X11), maybe Linux is the\nway of the future for the completely\naddicted to tinkering. Or those who\nfeel niche computing is the way of\nthe future and dislike svelte well-designed systems. Or those who like\nflagellating themselves.\nBy the way, I use OS X, and it\u2019s\ngreat.\nThe partisan\u2019s guide to Operating Systems\nby TRISTAN LANE\nDear Fit Biology Guy,\nI am terribly sorry that the blandness you revealed after our outing\nto Starbucks has been relegated to\na tale to be told in the pub just the\nonce, and never again.\nStormy.\nI can\u2019t write that in an email. No\nway. It\u2019s so ungracious, especially\nsince he\u2019d asked to be mentioned in\nmy fantastic column and bought me\ncoffee to have his prowess written all\nover this page. Unfortunately, Miss\nWoods does not do shallow, unless\nit\u2019s a more luxurious kind of shallow,\nwhere a completely hideous chap\nwith a lovely personality and hotshot\njob buys me a Tiffany solitaire with\na box of Godiva chocolates before\ngetting down on one knee. My materialism is substantiated in a belief,\npropagated by countless aunties,\nthat \u2018when money gets tight, love\nflies out of the window\u2019.\nI digress. Biology guy talked about\nfair trade, domestic products and\nhis E-number intolerance during an\nhour of bravado and rhetorical egotistical pandering. Not once did I get\na word in about myself. Not once did\nhe ask about me! Hmph.\nAnyway, more fascinating things\nbeckon. Like the night of passion\nI enjoyed in the presence of not\none but two of the most physically\nperfect men I\u2019ve ever met in my\nlife! What made it sweeter was the\nfact that they chose the inimitable\nStormy over the group of girls I\ndespise the most \u2013 those blubbery,\nself-absorbed gothic types, who\nautomatically dislike any girl more\narticulate and accomplished than\nthem. Not all gothic females offend\nme \u2013 it\u2019s just the pretension and the\nbitchiness I can\u2019t tolerate, especially\nfrom the kind who feel that wearing\noutrageous synthetic hair is a good\nidea in their attempts to distract\nmale attention away from a visage\nthat a blind mother couldn\u2019t love and\nan inch of clown make-up couldn\u2019t\ndisguise!\nPost-Camberwell warehouse party\n(where fire was juggled by guy one\nand atmospheric breakbeat techno\nwas spun by guy two), I realised\nthat getting back to Hammersmith\nfrom this post-modern squat (remi-niscent of the one seen in South\nWest 9, complete with sculptures,\nresident spiritual healer and visiting\ndrug dealer) at 2am was going to\nbe a mission. So I invited the most\nfascinating, well-travelled chaps to\nwalk me to the bus stop.\nGuy number one, Travis Fimmel\nlookalike replete with the most stunning foam mohawk, asked me for my\nnumber so we could meet up again. I\ntold him I\u2019d only see him if I could see\nguy number two (an infinitely more\ninteresting, snowboarding, younger\nversion of Jonathan Davis before he\ngot fat) at the same time. He agreed,\non the condition I snogged him right\nthen and there. Never one to shirk\nan opportunity, I entered a steamy\nclinch, first with Mohawk, and then\nhis friend. Before we knew it, we\nwere back at mine, after wanting,\nwishing, waiting and thinking of getting down to business.\nTechnically speaking, first base\nwas good. Mohawk held my body\nfirmly and gave the finest firm body\nmassage I\u2019d ever had! His kisses\nwere strong, but not sloppy, and\nhis oral anatomy knowledge was\nsuperb. Excellent. Unlike his floppy-tongued puppy of a mate, he knew\nhow to have a good time, and it was\non the strength of this that I let him\ngo further. It was here that I learnt\nlesson number one, for the ten millionth time:\n\u2018Good looking guys do not have to\ntry to keep girls interested. Hence,\nthey\u2019ve not got the time to develop their personalities, or bedroom\ntechniques, because they\u2019ve rarely\ngot a break from girls.\u2019\nHis breast technique required further practise \u2013 a lesson with the lesbians was just what he needed. The\nkitten approach, mixed with kneading movements, does not serve to\nplease. Breasts are not like penises,\nboys \u2013 take good care not to tear\nthem off!\nGoing south of the waist wasn\u2019t\nworth trying in the fear of that experience being equally dismal, so,\nwithout further ado, I skipped over\nto his uglier mate in the hope that\nthe \u2018ugly men make better lovers\u2019\ntheory might have held true. I was\nwrong. Nine times out of ten, I have\nbetter sex on my own.\nWe had an interesting take on the\nRockbitch board game (based on\nthe Ann Summers one), before I\nended up winning the golden condom and getting him to do whatever\nI wanted! \u2018Whatever\u2019 ended up being\n\u2018anything\u2019, and \u2018anything\u2019 ended up\nbeing the most beautiful body massage a girl could dream of!\nMassage over and done with, we\nended up going through the trauma of Korn-man being unable to\nmake himself stand to attention.\nRepeatedly. It got boring after the\nfifth time, and my politesse could\nonly extend to a limited period of\ntime. In impatience, whilst knowing\nthis not to be a reflection on myself,\nI bid him and his friend goodbye,\nand went off, in true Imperial style,\nto make love with the only reliable,\ntrue and technically perfect person\nwho could deliver the goods every\nsingle time. Myself.\nThe girl about town\nby STORMY WOODS\nWomen not internet savvy\n\n"
