    "content": "Welcome\nWelcome to Imperial\nCollege. If you're a new\nstudent, you're probably\nfeeling a little\napprehensive. Don't worry.\nMany of the students that\nyou see today are in the\nsame position as you. As\nsoon as you get to know a few of them life will seem a lot better. Don't be afraid of\ntalking to somebody you\ndon't know. They will be\nlooking for new friends as\nwell. Go to the introductory\nevents of as many clubs as\nyou can. Even if you don't continue as an active\nmember when academic\nwork starts, you'll have\nmade friends by joining in.\nGo to all the parties. Don't worry about making a fool\nof yourself by joining in.\nNext week you will have to\nstart work. Don't be stupid\nand fail your exams by not\ndoing any work. Make sure,\nthough, that you don't get\nso wrapped up in work that\nyou find you haven't got a social life.\nI apologise for giving you\nall this advice that may\nsound very patronising. I know people have been\ntelling you the do's and\ndon'ts of University life for\nweeks. Enjoy Freshers'\nWeek and forget all your\nmother's instructions about\nphoning every day and\ngetting to bed before\neleven.\nWelcome back and have\na good year if you're not a new student.\nFELIX\nFELIX is the best student\nnewspaper in the country.\nIt is fortunate in being free\nof Union control. This\nmeans that it can and does\ncriticise IC Union as well as\nthe College. FELIX has\nsome of the best facilities\nin the country. However it\nneeds your help if these\nfacilities are to be fully\nutilised. So, come and work\non FELIX. It doesn't matter\nif you haven't any\nexperience. It's your\nenthusiasm that counts.\nIf you're a second or\nthird year, you may have\nnoticed that FELIX has\nchanged a little during the\nsummer. If you have any\nview on the changes write\nto me in the FELIX Office.\nThe copy deadline for\nletters, small ads and\nwhat's on is 1.00pm Monday.\nIC Union\nAs a student at Imperial\nCollege you are\nautomatically a member of\nIC Union. IC Union\nrepresents you and spends\n# [ di i of i a over \u00a3250,000 of your\nmoney. IC Union is\nimportant. If you read the\nletters column you'll find a letter complaining that the\nUnion is clique y and\nintimidating. It also\ncomplains of the childish\nbehaviour of Union officers.\nBoth of these criticism are\nfair. This criticisms though,\nis not because Union\nofficers are different! It is\nbecause few people\nattempt to take part in the\ngovernment of the Union.\nOn Thursday there is a Union General Meeting.\nThis is the one opportunity\nordinary students have to\nquestion their\nrepresentatives. If College\nare thinking about\nincreasing your rent they\ndon't talk to you, they ask\nthe Union what you think.\nThe only way the Union\ncan consult you is by\nholding General Meetings.\nIf you don't go, Union\npolicy will be formulated by\nthe same clique y group\nwho always formulate U GM policy. It is pathetic\ncomplaining about IC\nUnion if you don't make\nsome attempt to change it.\nby going to UGMs.\nRag Mag\nAt the U GM on Thursday\nyou will have the\nopportunity to decide\nwhether you want to be\nable to buy a Rag Mag that\nin places is very funny or\nwhether you want to\nimprove the reputation of\nImperial College. Other\ncolleges believe that IC is\nfull of racist, sexist piss-artists. This stops people\ncoming to Imperial. The\nRag Mag contains racist\njokes. If you want to\nimprove the image of\nImperial, support the\nExecutive. If you want to be\nknown as a racist, vote for\nthe ban to be lifted.\nCasual Labour\nCollege employs a large\nnumber of casual workers\nin the bars, Summer\nAccommodation Centre\netc. In the last few weeks\nthere have been several\ncomplaints that students\nhave been discouraged\nfrom taking these jobs.\nCollege has a duty to help\nstudents find jobs. Many\nstudents can only survive\nby finding casual jobs. If\nCollege doesn't give\nstudents preferential\ntreatment when taking on\nc casual workers it is failing\nin its duty to look after\nstudents.\nBar Prices\nCollege Bars are meant to\nprovide a service for\nstudents. They aren't meant\nto make the \u00a330,000 profit\nthey make each year. They\naren't meant to sub sid is e the refectories. Last week I went into the Union Bar\none lunchtime. Outside\nthere were fifteen or twenty\nstudents protesting. The\nbar was full of workmen,\nmany of whom weren't College employees. The\nonly students were those\nworking behind the bar. At\nthe next U GM get Carl\nBurgess to protest to\nCollege about the bar price\nrises and get him to\norganise a boycott if\nCollege don't do\nsomething.\nSabbaticals\nThe Executive have failed\nin their duties this summer.\nThey were right to ban the\nRag Mag but they should\nhave banned it before it\nwent to the printers. Their\njob description requires\nthem to check the artwork.\nThey didn't do this and the\nUnion has lost \u00a31500 as a result.\nRob Northey has\nintroduced plans that could\nwreck the bars. His staff\nwon't work for him if he\nasks them to give national\ninsurance numbers.\nStudents won't go in the\nbars because they know\nthat the price rises are over\nthe top. Instead of\ncampaigning against the\nchanges the Union\nsabbaticals agreed to the\nrises. The sabbaticals\nwasted an opportunity to\ndo something for students.\nAsk at the U GM what the\nUnion sabbaticals have\ndone this summer.\nCover\nThis week's FELIX cover\nhas been criticised. It is\nclaimed that it gives the\nwrong impression. While it\nis a little over the top, there\nare people who try and\nchat up any woman they\nsee. Don't let this put you\noff going to the Freshers'\nevents. You can always tell\nthem to get lost.\nICU Handbook\nIf you haven't got your\ncopy yet then go and get\none from IC Union office. It\nis excel lant. Nigel Atkinson\nhas done a thoroughly\nprofessional job. The\ncomplaints about the cover\nare crap. It was there to\ngive the Handbook impact.\nIt succeeded. Inside the\ncover Nigel explains that\nCarl Burgess was raising\nmoney for charity when he\ni ad his hair shaved.\n...but were afraid to\nask\nMake sure that you take a copy and keep it. This is an\nexcel lant guide to all those\nthings your mother forgot\nto tell you about. You may\nnever need to refer to it. It's better, though, to have it\nthere just in case.\nTickets\nFELIX has twenty free\ntickets for tomorrow's Hip\nParade at the Camden\nPalace. Two tickets will be\ngiven to the first ten people\nto come into the FELIX\nOffice and ask for them.\nAthletics\nMy apologies for not\nkeeping my promise to\nAthletics and Cross County\nClub by not putting their\nfull name on the Freshers'\nFair plan. If you are\ninterested in competing at\nathletics for Imperial, go\nand visit the Cross Country\nstall at Freshers' Fair.\nCredits\nThanks to Tony Churchill,\nRosemary Hosking, Chris\nEdwards, Nigel Atkinson, J Martin Taylor, Sarah Kirk,\nOligo, Judith Hackney, Carl\nBurgess, Dave Rowe, Dave\nJones, Pete Hobbis, Jon\nJones, Alan Rose, Simon\nBanton, Dave Parry, Lesley\nGillingham, John Ingham,\nand John Burgess.

A group of\nmechanical engineers are\nrunning a sweepstake on\nthe date ICU President,\nCarl Burgess, either resigns\nor is booted out of office.\nIn view of the yet-to-be-explained Rag Mag\nbanning, Below The Belt\nsuspects those who chose\ndates in the Autumn term\nhave the best chance of\nwinning the not\ninsubstantial prize.\nHowever, it remains to be\nseen if Dave 'Not So Rave'\nKingston is to pip Carl at\nthe post. Dithering Dave\nwas clear favourite to be\nthe first to go but Carl's sudden sprint before the\nstart of term means that the\nrace is wide open. Get\nthose bets on soon.\nRag Mag banning s are\nnow a traditional start to\nevery year but even the\nmost hardened ob servo rs have been surprised by\nCarl Burgess' sudden\nconcern for good taste and\nthe sanctity of IC Union's reputation. For the 1983\nRag Mag, editor C Burgess,\nwas widely criticised as\nbeing tasteless, sexist,\nracist etc. Angry ie tter s and\nunfavourable coverage in\nthe national press ensued\nsuccessful Rag Mag selling\ntrips. But for Carl it was not\ntasteless enough! The\nUnion Executive of the day\nwisely removed a number\nof the more extreme 'jokes'.\nHowever, Carl was so upset\nthat he had all the banned\njokes reprinted in a copy of\nFELIX with paragraphs of\nexplanation from him as to\ntheir merit.\nOne of Mr Burgess' more\nrecent ideas was to have a bonfire with the 2000\ncopies of the new Rag Mag\nwhich have been delivered.\nPerhaps any remaining\ncopies of his offering could\nalso join any raging\ninferno. It might help dilute\nthe smell of hypocrisy\ncurrently floating around.\nCarl's dislike for the\neditor of the offending Rag\nMag, Tony Spencer, knows\nno bounds. At a recent\nparty in Shepherds Bush\nattended by a mass of\nUnion notables, Carl found\nhimself needing to relieve\nhimself. As ever on such\noccasions, Carl found the\ntoilet engaged so adopted\nthe novel tactic of urinating\nover someone's jacket. In\nhis drunken stupor, Cari\nmust not have realised that\nthe jacket belonged to one\nTony Spencer. The\nresidents of the flat must\nhave taken a crumb of\ncomfort that he left the\ncarpet alone; the carpet in\nthe room in Southside\nwhich Carl occupied last\nyear has now been\nreplaced.\nAt the end of last term,\nthe announcement\nregarding the new Rector\nwas made at a meeting of\nthe Governing Body, which\nis followed by a lunch\nattended by assorted Union\nhacks and the College's Governors. While everyone\nwas happily diving into the\nsalmon and strawberries\nthe FELIX Editor\u2014elect was\nbusy hopping around 170\ntrying to arrange an\ninterview with Professor\nAsh. An early morning chat W/ gm\nwas promptly arranged for | H the next week.

    "content": "!G\\>l GCD' The Season, Hugh Southey looks at\nthree Great American Movies.\nCocoon is a science\nfiction-fantasy about some\nold age pensioners who\ndiscover the secret of\neternal youth. It is about a charter-board skipper who\nfalls in love with an\nextraterrestrial. It is about a friendly group of aliens.\nThe press release claims\nthat 'together they embark\non a wondrous adventure\nin which they all learn more\nabout love, life and\nfriendship than they ever\ndreamed possible' That is\nvery pre ten cio us and over\nthe top. Cocoon has no\ndeep messages about love,\nlife or anything else. It is\njust an entertaining piece\nof cinema. It makes you\nlaugh in some places and\nmoves you in other places.\nDon Ameche, Wilford\nBramley and Hume Cronyn\nare all excellent as the old\nage pensioners who are\nrejuvenated. This film is\nworth going to see (even if\nthe few scenes that use\nspecial effects are awful)\nwhich is more than can be\nsaid for Code Of Silence.\nCode Of Silence is about a Chicago policeman who\ndecides to take on\norganised crime single\nhanded. It has a few good\nstunts, but that is only\ngood thing that can be said\nabout it. If you can believe\nthat a policeman can take\non forty villains armed with\nmachine guns, then this is\nyour film. If you enjoy\nseeing loads killed then this\nis your film. If you like\nsomething that is a little\ndeeper then I advise you to\nsee something else.\nThe Holcroft Covenant is\nbased on an interesting\nRobert Ludlum story.\nUnfortunately the acting,\nscript and directing ruins\nthe film. Most of the acting\nis dire, and people were\nlaughing out loud during\nthe seduction scenes. This\nfilm is one of those big\nbudgeted flops that are\nreally worth avoiding.\nWhilst Code Of Silence is\naimed at people who enjoy\nviolent films, (and they will\nprobably think it was quite\ngood), I can't believe\nanyone will enjoy The\nHolcroft Covenant.\nMore tears for the Red Sea. 'Living in peace with one\nanother' is a subject\nperhaps best left alone\nwhen dealing with the\nLebanon. But Beyond The\nWalls, the latest foreign-film offering from Gate\nCinema, Notting Hill,\nthrows caution to the wind,\npropaganda to the people\nto show that\nPalestinian/Israeli unity can\nexist, if only on the\ncomfortably distanced\nsilver screen.\nBeyond The Walls uses the\ntensions of an Israeli prison\nin which to explore the\npossibilities of such unity.\nBoth Arabic and Jewish\nprisoners (many with\nconflicting criminal\ncharges) are forced to live\ntogether - a practice which\nrarely occurs on the West\nBank; here the prison\ngovernors stage drug\nracketeering and riots in\norder to fuel the racial\ntensions between the two\nraces. It is in this climate\nthat the two leaders, Uri\n(Arnon Zadok) and Issam\n(Muhamad Bakri), establish\nallegiance and strength to\nconfront their gaol ers in a hunger strike which\nremains unresolved.\nIt is tragic to contrive such\nfantasies in which to stage\nthis message of mutual\nunderstanding, and,\nhowever genuine the intent\nof its Israeli makers, the\nfilm is worthless in real\nterms. As moralistic\npropaganda, it is peculiarly\ndisturbing to see two sides,\nbitterly opposed beyond\nthe walls, seek redress\nagainst some other,\nelevated mutual oppressor,\nfor there is no common\nenemy in the Lebanon.\nWould that this were a British film, a French film\nor an American film to raise\nan independant voice\nagainst the hostilities.\nAdmittedly, the film has a host of European awards to\nacclaim, including the\nInternational Film Critic's Prize and a literal armful of\nOscars. But these do little\nto take away the film's futility after the solemn\nhead-nodding and\ncongr atul tio no are over.\n..books.\nIN WATERMELON SUGAR\nR. Brautigan\nYet another weirdo book\nfrom Brautigan. I think he\nmust be trying to compete\nwith Hemingway for\npeculiar prose style and\nstupid concepts. A very\nhirsute novel about 'gentle\npeople leading sleepy lives\nin watermelon sugar', that\nis, nothing at all. Worth a chortle, but only to be\nappreciated if you're on an\nacid trip. It was probably\nwritten during one.\n(Picador, \u00a31.95)\nNOVEL WITH COCAINE\nM. Ageyev\nThis rediscovered Russian\nnovel, by an anonymous\nauthor, was written near\nthe time of the 1917\nrevolution. It is based\naround an anti-hero, Valim,\na self-conscious and self-humiliated adolescent who\nbecomes a cocaine addict,\nand about his increasing\ndependance on the drug,\nso that faced with the death\nof his mother, his only\nreaction is to seek out\nmore of the narcotic. A disturbing and profound\nwork. (Picador, \u00a32.95)\nMcCARTHY S LIST\nMary Mackey\nA black comedy in which a woman condemned to be\nshot for the murder of an\nold lady whom she did not\nin fact kill, writes about her\nlife. It is difficult to tell\nwhether she is madder than\nthe world around her, and\nher paranoia is reminiscent\nof Kafka. Even the happy\n(?) ending leaves me\nwondering whether she is\nfree, or a ghost. This is a remarkable book, definitely\nworth missing lectures to\nfinish. (Picador \u00a31.95)\nTHE ART OF EATING\nM. F.K. Fisher\nA750 page tome which is a comprehensive array of\nfeeding. Some parts, such\nas the social status of the\nvegetable, may be over-elaborate and unnecessary,\nbut the chapters on 'How to\nboil water', 'How not to boil\nan egg' and 'How to cook\nlike a wolf are the types of\nbasic noshing we need.\nThe whole massive work is\nas dotted with anecdotes as\na rich pate is with truffle\nand makes light reading if\nnot light eating. An\nexcellent book. (Picador,\n\u00a34.95)\nSarah Kirk\n24 Monday 30 September FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "there is an enormously\nstrong case for having an\nincrease in the total\nresources going into the\napplied sciences whilst\npreserving and perhaps\nenhancing the rest as well.\nF: The green paper\ncriticised four year courses\nsaying that some of the\ntraining provided should\nreally come from the\nindustry. Have you any\nviews on four year\ncourses?\nA: I do have a view, but all I can offer you at present is\na parochial view. I can tell\nyou what we have recently\ndone in the Department of\nElectrical Engineering at\nUniversity College. We\nhave started a four year\ncourse where some\nstudents will obtain a BSc\nafter three years, and some\nwill go on for a fourth year.\nThe decision as to who\ndoes what will be taken at\nthe end of the second year,\nand will depend, first of all,\non student preferences,\nand secondly on academic\nattainment. The view that I hold is that there really is a very strong case for four\nyears of study for those\npeople who want to engage\nin it. I think that if we are\ngoing to try and claim that\nour university courses are\nequivalent to those that you\nfind on the continent,\nFrance and Germany in\nparticular, we do have to\nhave at least some people\ntaking four year courses. I do not take the view that\nwas advocated in the\nFinneston Report; that the\nbrig he st people should take\nfour year courses and the\nless able three year\ncourses. I believe (hat there\nwill be some exceedingly\nable students who will to\nleave after three years,\nperhaps to do research in a university, or to go straight\ninto industry. I think that\nthe people who want to do\nfour year courses will all be\nable.I don't see it as a simple separation of the\nsheep and the goats.\nF: What do you think about\nthe governments proposals\nfor two year degree\ncourses?\nA: I really h avn' t had a chance to look at that at\nall. My initial reaction is\npretty negative. There are\ntwo year degree courses\nthat I have seen in the\nUnited States, but they are\nreally intended to be a halfway house on the way\nto a proper degree. There\nis an intention to pack into\ntwo years what would\notherwise go into three.\nF: The green paper was very\ncritical of student unions. It\ncriticised them for ultra-vire s expenditure and\nfailing in their duty to\nensure freedom of s peach. What do you think is the\nrole of student unions?\nA: I didn't really participate\nin Union activities when I was a student, and Iha v n't really had much contact\nwith Union matters at\nUniversity College either,\nhave to confess that\nengineers on the whole\ntend to be apathetic, and\ndon't participate as much\nas I feel they should. My\ngeneral views on student\nunions is that they should\nflourish. When you talk\nabout the freedom of\nspeech, are you talking\nabout the issue that has\narisen at other universities\nof whether unions should\ngive speaking rights to\ncertain un favoured politicians?\nF: Yes.\nA: I think that's to be\ndeprecated. I feel that any\nuniversity society has a right to invite whoever they\nwant, and having invited\nthem they should be\nwelcome and listened to; if\nnot with respect, at least\nwith attention.\nF: Students at IC are very\nconcerned about the\nteaching standards in\ncertain departments. Will\nyou support the present\nRector's drive to improve\nteaching standards?\nA: Obviously I can't comment on teaching\nstandards at IC I can't even\ncomment on teaching\nstandards at University\nCollege, but I have a passionate interest in\nteaching standards in my\ndepartment. It is a fiendishly complex issue.\nPromotion in universities\nhas been traditionally been\nbased primarily on\nre a search and not on\nteaching. The arguments in\nfavour of continuing to do\nthis are really quite faulty.\nHowever there is one thing\nthat one has to admit and\nthat is that it is quite\npossibly to judge research\nperformance, whereas it is\nfiendishly difficult to judge\nteaching performance.\nNevertheless I think it\nshould be attempted. I 've\nhad one minor impact on\nthe promotion system at\nUniversity College during\nthe time that I was Dean,\nand that relates to the\ncriteria adopted when\npromoting to a senior\nlectureship. Very roughly\nthe criterion adopted is that\nfor promotion to\nreadership, two-thirds on\none's performance is\njudged on research and\none-third on teaching and\nother administrative duties.\nIn the case of promotion to\nSenior Lecturer the\nproportions are reversed. I have always emphasised\nthat, even for a Reader, you\nshould regard these\nasses ment s as\nmultiplicative. In other\nwords, if someone scores\nnought for teaching ability,\nthen it should not be\npossible to promote him or\nher to a Readership;\nhowever good they are as a researcher, and vice-versa.\nHowever good one is as a teacher, part of one's life at\nuniversity must involve\nresearch, and so some\nindication that these people\nhave contributed to\nresearch also seems\nessential. One of the\nproblems in asse sing teaching is that the people\nwho seem to know about it\ntend to be ther person's immediate colle gue s in his\nor her own department. I feel that one ought to seek\nmore references from\nsenior members of a department when\npromoting junior members\nof that department, in order\nto make a better attempt at\nassessing teaching\nteaching. This is ending up\nas a speech but I do feel\nvery strongly about this.\nThere is one more thing\nthat I 've tried in my own\nlectures at times and which\nis almost universal in some\nAmerican universities\nincluding Stanford, and\nthat is where the lecturer\nhands out at the end of the\ncourse, a question aire in\nwhich the students are\nasked to assess all aspects\naspects of that particular\ncourse; the subject matter,\nthe speed, the degree of\nstimulation or boredom and\nso on. I feel that it is a rather good discipline for\neveryone to subject\nthemselves to, although I would not be in favour of\nutilising this information or\nmaking it available to any\nthird parties. I feel that it's a very good feedback\nmechanism for the lecturer\nhimself.\nF: Many departments have\nalready adopted similar\nschemes.\nAnother problem that\nmany students find is that\nof finding accommodation.\nCollege is considering\nbuilding a new hall. It may\nuse the profits from the\nsale of the gravel at the\nHarlington sports ground to\npay for it. Do you see this\nas a solution? Do you see\naccommodation as one of\nyour main problems?\nA: Yes absolutely. We\nregard it as a very major\nissue at University College.\nIt must count as one of the\nkey issues for any\na cede mic institut uti on in\nLondon. Obviously I can't comment at this stage on\nthe disposition of available\nresources.\nF: The union are very\nworried about the College's attitude to overseas\nstudents. They believe that\nthe College present an\nunfair view of London when\nrecruiting these students.\nThey also believe that these\nstudents are sometimes\ntreated differently from\nhome students and as a result ghettos are created.\nWhat policy do you think\nthe college should adopt\ntowards overseas students?\nA: I think I would like to\nduck the details of that\nquestion because it is very\ndifficult to comment from\nthe outside. I think one of\nthe great things about the\nUniversity of London, since\nits inception, has been that\nthere has always been a high percentage of people\nfrom all parts of the world.\nI agree that with you that\nit is highly undesirable that\noverseas students feel that\nthey can only talk to each\nother, and do not spread\nthrough the community. To\ngive you one example, we\nhave five Chinese scholars\nstudying in the Electrical\nEngineering Department\nhere at University College. I have made it an absolute\nrule that they can never\nshare an office together, for\nthis reason.\nF: Another thing is that the\nUnion is worried about\naccess by the President of\nIC Union to the Rector. Do\nyou feel that the President\nis an important person.\nA: I do think that the\nPresident is important and I do not believe that access\nto me will be a problem,\nprovided that people are\nprepared to see me at what\nmight be called un social hours.\nF: IC almost regards itself\nas a university, and often\nignores the rest of the\nUniversity of London. Do\nyou see this changing?\nA: Again, I would prefer to\njudge that when I'm on the\nspot, but I suppose the fact\nthat Lord Flowers will now\nbe the Vice Chancellor of\nthe University might help to\nstrengthen links.\nF: Finally, have you got\nanything that you are very\nkeen to change at Imperial?\nA: I think that I'm going to\nduck that one too. I think\nhaving a new doctor come\nin and immediately start\nprescribing remedies would\nbe a big mistake.\nF: Thank you very much,\nProfessor Ash.\nA: Thank you.\n25*\nc3 FELIX Monday 30 September 9\n\n"

DEPUTY PRESIDENT'S REPORT TO UGM.\n1. Bars and Bulk Purchasing.\nLast year NUS decided to take over the various bulk purchasing consortia which had developed over the last ten years. These consortia successfully negotiated large scale discounts on bulk purchasing for students' unions\nthroughout the country. In July Quentin and I attended the Bars Working\nParty Conference. Despite opposition from us and some other London\ncolleges, the BWP decided to dissolve itself in favour of this NUS\ndominated National Student Services Organisation. In the meantime, as\nmandated by Council I have organised a couple of informal meetings with other London Unions, with a view to setting up a London consortium. No\ncommitment to do this, try to change NSSO from within or go it alone has\nbeen reached. Instead, a general feeling to wait for ULU to take a lead, was reached. Once ULU has decided upon its stance on this issue I will report back with definite proposals for our course of action.2. Union Snack Bar.\nLast year was the Snack Bar's first year of operation. A good profit was\nreturned. This year we would like to improve, so we need you to help in two ways. Firstly, eat there - it is the cheapest and best food outlet in College. Secondly, let either Norman (our brilliant Catering Manager) or me know of any improvements that you would like to see.\nFreshers' Fair. I hope it went well I will report verbally on this.4.

In addition the best type of anti theft device is a Citadel Lock.\nThese can be bought at cost price for tV5 from ths S her field Security Desk.\nFreshers' Week.\nI hope that you've enjoyed it so far and continue to do so.

The\narticle was by Chinyelu\nOnwurah, a second year\nundergraduate in Elecrical\nEngineering.\nMs Onwurah told FELIX\nthat she could not speak\nfor the black community at\nIC.

    "content": "Gareth Pulls It Off\nSwift action by Bar Committee Secretary, Gareth\nFish, last week brought to an end the selling of\nbeer at inflated prices in College bars. It was Mr\nFish's careful scrutiny of the new price list, drawn\nup by refectory manager Rob Northey, which\nbrought the errors to light.\nMr Northey presented the\nrevised prices when the Bar\nCommittee met on Monday\n16 September. The\nincreases, he said, were to\nmaintain beer prices at the\n40% gross profit margin in\nSouthside bar as agreed\nbetween Mr Northey's predecessor Victor\nMooney, and former ICU\nDeputy President Christine\nTeller. The new price list\nincluded some severe\nincreases in the cost of\ncertain beers, mixers, fruit\njuices and hot and cold bar\nfood. No major objections\nwere made during the\nmeeting, and the new\nprices were subsequently\nintroduced last Tuesday.\nThe alarm was raised by\nMr Fish after he had had\ntime to check the proposed\nprices. His own\ncalculations showed that\nalmost every brand of beer\nhad been priced above the\nagreed mark-up level.\nUnion president Carl\nBurgess and Deputy\nPresident Dave Kingston\nbrought the matter to Mr\nNorthey's attention last\nThursday. Mr Northey\nimmediately agreed to\nreduce the price of many of\nthe beers. He admitted that\nthe new prices had been\ncalculated on the basis of a40% profit margin at Union\nBar rates. Draft beer prices\nare traditionally 2p lower in\nthe Union Bar than those in\nSouthside, hence his\ncalculations were wrong.\nMr Fish maintains that\nmany prices are still too\nhigh. He claims that none\nof the benefits of the\nsubstantial discounts which\nthe bars receive from the\nbreweries are being passed\non to the customer.\nIn an interview with\nFELIX, Mr Northey said that\nsome of the apparent\nsurplus was offset by\nwastage and by free drinks\nprovided for bar staff. The\nprices of food in the bars,\nhe explained, had been reorganised to bring them\ninto line with the prices in\nthe refectories. Neither\nfood prices, nor those of\nmixers and fruit juices were\ncovered by the 40%\nagreement, which applied\nto beer only. Mr Northey\nstressed, however that he\nwas aiming to agree a pricing policy so that there\ncould be no further\ndisputes.\nThere was more\ndiscontent expressed about\nMr Northey's management\nlast week, when it was\ndiscovered that the bars\nwould no longer be paying\nregular student staff as\ncasual labour. Instead of\nbeing paid cash-in-hand,\nstudents will have to\ndeclare their earnings. Mr\nNorthey said that many\nstudents worked on a regular basis and to\nclassify this as casual\nlabour was illegal.\n'Genuine' students, he\ncontinued, could easily fill\nin the relevant tax\nexemption form and so\nshould not suffer as a result of the change. Mr\nNorthey also drew attention\nto the substantial pay rise,\nfrom \u00a31.65 to \u00a32.00 per\nhour, which had been\nintroduced for bar staff.\nMr Northey was criticised\nfor not telling the Bar\nCommittee of his decision.\nHe told FELIX that he had\nnot raised the matter at the\ncommittee as it was he who\nwas legally responsible for\nthe running of the system.\nMr Northey's comments\nwere greeted with severe\nscepticism by Union\nofficers and bar regulars.\nMr Burgess was concerned\nthat the new system of\npayment would dissuade\nmany postgraduates from\nworking behind the bars, as\nthey would not qualify for\ntax exemption.\nThere will be a motion\nconcerning bar prices and\npolicy at the Union General\nMeeting on Thursday. The\nmotion, proposed by RCS\nHon Sec and member of\nBar Committee, Tom\nMeliar-Smith, claims that\nthe student members of Bar\nCommittee 'grossly\nmisrepresented student\nviews', and calls for them to\nbe removed from the\ncommittee.\nA collection of notables protesting about\nthe increase in bar prices.\nTwo in a bed\nFrantic work was being\ndone on Willis Jackson\nHouse, Evelyn Gardens,\nlast Friday in an attempt to\ncomplete alterations before\nnew residents moved in at\nthe weekend. Though the\nrepairs have been in\nprogress throughout the\nsummer, it seemed unlikely\non Friday that the work\nwould be completed when\nnew students move in on\nSaturday. As a result, many\nfresher s may now be living\nin sub-standard\naccommodation. Subwarden Graham Oakes told\nFELIX that there was still a large amount of painting\nand carpet-fitting to be\nfinished, and that the house\nwas short of twenty-one\nbeds.\nStudent Services Officer,\nDon Ferguson, was still\nRag Drag\nThe fate of this year's Rag\nMag will be decided at\nThursday's Union General\nMeeting. Rag chairman\nJohn Ingham is intending\nto propose a motion which,\nif passed, will reverse the\nban on the Rag Mag which\nwas imposed by the ICU\nExec. The decision to ban\nthe magazine was taken\nonly after printing had been\ncompleted. Mr Ingham\nmaintains that his year's Rag Mag is no more\noffensive than the last\nissue, which was edited by\nICU president Carl\nBurgess.\nhopeful that all the\nnecessary work should be\ncompleted on time.\nWillis Jackson is not the\nonly residence where work\nis in progress. Last minute\nalterations on the top floor\nof Montpelier hall were still\nbeing completed at the\ntime of going to press. A small number of rooms in\nRayleigh and Willis\nJackson Houses are in\nneed of further attention\nowing to the recent\ndiscovery of dry rot. Mr\nFerguson said that he\nexpected this to be\ncompleted by Christmas.\nSouthside Halls are being\naltered to bring them into\nline with GLC fire\nregulations. Each landing is\nto be sealed off so as to\nprevent a fire spreading\nswiftly through a staircase.\nIn response to requests\nfrom students, some rooms\nare being converted to\nprovide kitchen facilities on\nthe staircases themselves.\nThis work is expected to go\non all year round, but will\ndiscontinue during the\nsummer term.\nAnyone who is still\nwithout a place to live\nshould call in at the\nStudent Services Office (15\nPrinces Gardens) on\nMonday afternoon. Some\nplaces in College\nresidences will become\navailable through non-arrival of some students. All\napplications for these\nplaces will be considered,\nbut prefer ene will be given\nto overseas students,\npostgraduates, women and\nfirst years.\nMonday 30 September FELIX\n\n"

Application forms are currently available from the Union Office in Be it Quad, the deadline for applications being 5.30pm Friday 4th October.\nThey are awarded on merit and only about one quarter of the usual number\nof applicants will be able to be satisfied. If you don't really need\none please please do not apply as it will just cause us more work. If\nyou are resident in the boroughs of Westminister or Kensington & Chelsea,\nfor instance if you are living in a College hall or house, you will be\neligible to apply for a residents permit. This of course doesn't mean\nthat you will get one.\nUnfortunately this year we have permanently lost one parking space due\nto an allocated space being over a fire hydrant which the fire brigade\nare causing hassle over.3. Transport.\nWe currently have four transit crew buses in reasonable condition including a new white 13 seater. It is imperative that these vans are\nkept in reasonable nick to reduce costs to users so it is vital that\nthey are treated kindly. After some consultations with people in the motor trade it appears\nthat our vans should be run on 4 star petrol not 2 star as has\npreviously been used. All users please take note.\n4. UGM and Council Policy Books.\nWithin reason I have managed to update these to contain all motions\nthat were submitted to UGM's and Council and subsequently passed, some\nin amended form, to date. They do not contain the various parts of\npolicy passed in reports and minutes. This took a considerable amount\nof time and was not helped by some of my predecessors losing minutes\netc., so that it was not possible to confirm which motions were passed.\nI am happy to report that my immediate predecessor Eric Darbyshire was\nalmost entirely blameless in this respect. Having said that Hon. See's are really great people.\n5 . Coffee Machine.\nI understand from Chris Clements that RSMU has obtained a new coffee\nmachine and that the old Maxpax one has been taken in part exchange.\nI would like to record my sorrow at the demise and departure of an\nold friend. R.I.P.********** RETURNING OFFICER'S REPORT.\n1. Ratification s. The following elections were held at the AGM last year and I ask the\nmeeting to ratify the results: a)2 Ordinary Members of Council: Tom Mel liar Smith Jane Ryder.\nb)4 Delegates to GUC:Jon Ingham\nAlan Rose\nTom Mel liar Smith.

The\nCarousel of parties, rag-stunts shopping, cooking and lectures\nnever seems to stop\u2014it just carries on spinning until its\noccupants fall off, tired, dizzy and usually just a little hung-over.\nFresher's Week is a traumatic experience for the newcomers, an\nego trip fo those who have seen it all, done it all and managed\nto pass their exams afterwards.\n6\nFRESHER S'V EEK IS THE ULTIMATE TEST OF INITIATIVE & STAMINA\nMonday begins with the Rector's Reception, an event to which\neveryone goes and then spends the remainder of their time at\nCollege wondering why they bothered. As practise for things to\ncome, queues form outside the Great Hall from 9.30pm. This\nyear provides the super-novelty of a new Rector and hence an\namended speech from the stalwart of the past ten receptions.\nThe Union sabbaticals always manage to say a few things\nwrong, usually to the embarrassment of audience and speaker\nalike.\nThe remainder of Monday morning is spent trying to register\nand obtain a Union card. Those in the know will have done it\nalready or will wait until Tuesday. Large queues from in the\nJCR, with the student television station STOIC providing\nirritating commercials; the incentive being that one can only\nobtain a grant after obtaining a union card or registration slip.\nAll this excitement is mixed with a visit to the department at\nsometime during the day. The odd face will be familiar from the\ninterview. After sampling a College lunch for the first and\nprobably last time, you are expected to divide along tribal lines\nand to go to your CCU's( Crackpots, C** ts and Unwashed)\nUGM. It is here that you will learn to worship lumps of metal,\nchant mindless drivel and, if you are really mentally deficient\nenjoy it.

Hopefully, we now know someone\nwell enough to troll along to the New Year's Party with them. If\nyou have't then get off your backside. It is usually fairly dark at\nENTS gigs, so you do not notice the lack of women as easily.\nTuesday morning comes about four hours too early but if you\nare lucky then you'll remember where you are; if you are\nexceptionally lucky it will be in someone else's room. The\nmorning is spent in a series of boring tours of departments\u2014all\ndesigned to get you into the true College routine. Livelier things\nawait in the afternoon at Fresher's Fair. All the Union Societies\ntry to impress you into joining but they cannot take any money\noff you on-the-spot, so just sign up for anything that takes your\nfancy-there is nothing to lose however your pigeonhole will\nup pretty quickly.\n\n"

If the U GM tells me\nto jump, I jump. It has the\npower to question my\nactions, tell me what to do\nand even has the power to\nsack me. As members of IC\nUnion you all have the right\nto vote, to put forward\npolicy and question\ndecisions made. If you do\nnot do so you will have to\nlive with the policies made\nby others on your behalf.\nEven if you disagree with\nthose policies they will be\nyour policies whether you\nlike it or not. I can only\nurge you to turn up and\nexercise your democratic\nright and not allow vocal\nminorities to dictate the\npolicies of the Union.\nOn a lighter note Nicola\nRossi, the President of\nUniversity of London\nUnion, will be explaining\nthe role of ULU and what it\ncan offer the IC student.

The Union Snack Bar\nHas now reopened (thank\ngoodness\u2014three months of\nUnion Bar food is\nHORRIBLE).

To get\nyours pop up to the Union\noffice and ask for one from\nKathy or me.\nSecurity\nIs a college of this size is\na major problem. Property\nleft unattended is easy pray\nfor walk in thieves. To stop\nthis don't leave valuables\n(especially, money\ncheques books, credit\ncards) lying around; make\nsure that the door to your\nroom is locked when you\nare not in; don't let any\nstrangers into your hall or\nhouse. The most common\ntargets for thieves however,\nare push bikes. Protect\nyours. College security\nhave organised two ways of\nhelping you.

    "content": "Over the last few years the\nImperial College Rag Mag\nhas been produced not to\nraise money for charity,\nwhich should be its aim,\nbut to compete with the\nSteve Marshall rag mag in\nthe bad taste and\noffensiveness stakes. The\nmoney raising aspect has\nbeen relegated to a byproduct of this individual\nrag mag. It is true that\nthere is no other rag mag\nin the country that can\ncompete with its technical\nexcellence but it is a fact\nthat no other college in the\ncountry (except for the odd\nMedical School) would\nwant to match us in the\nnasty, sexist, racist joke\ndepartment. Individuality is\nnot a bad thing but we\nhave allowed it to take over\nour good taste, and to\ncloud our judgement of\nwhat is offensive and what\nis not. We use fatuous\nargue ment s such as\n'everyone says them so\nwhy shouldn't we print\nthem' and bandy about\nphases such a 'Freedom of\nexpression' and 'free\nspeech' but with freedom\ncomes responsibility.\nFreedom needs a framework otherwise the\nexercise of freedom by\nsome will infringe on the\nfreedom of others. It is time\nthat we realised that there\nare more people living in\nthis world than the few\nthousand students at\nImperial College. Our rag\nmag is our public face. It is\nthe only medium through\nwhich many people come\ninto contact with Imperial.\nUnderstandably they\nformulate their views on us\nas a college by this rag\nmag. We are branded as\nsexist and racists but we\nclaim we are not as we do\nnot discriminate against\nany group, we go out of\nour way to offend every\ngroup. The jokes put in the\nrag mag are chosen by the\nEditor irrespective of race,\ncolour and sex, physical\ndisability, disaster (natural\nor otherwise), and people\nin the public eye (Dead or\nalmost).\nThe question each of you\nmust ask yourselves is, 'Do\nI want to be associated\nwith such a publication?'\nbecause each of you are by\nvirtue of attending this\nforemost college of science\nand technology. You can\nnot escape the fact that\nalthough you might not\nhave had anything to do\nwith its production or\ncontent, you are associated\nwith the Imperial College\nL rag mag. It is your rag mag\nwhether you like it or not.\nBurgess\nSlams\nRag Mag\nThe Imperial College Rag Mag has always been\ncontroversial. In the early sixties, David Irvine, the\nhistorian, was criticised for producing a racist\nRag Mag. More recently two Rag Mags, those\nedited by Steve Marshall and Patrick Coll, have\nbeen banned by UGMs. The Guardian used the\nRag Mag as an example of racism at British\nUniversities. This Thursday the UGM will have\nthe opportunity to challenge, ICU President, Carl\nBurgess's decision to ban the Rag Mag. In this\narticle, Mr Burgess, a former Rag Mag Editor,\nexplains why he thinks the UGM should support\nhis decision.\nThe reasons why this\nsorry state of affairs has\narisen is because at\nImperial there are far too\nfew people who are willing\nto do what needs to be\ndone, hence one person\nwill find him/herself doing\nseveral jobs. The rag mag\neditor, itself a highly\nunique post in the whole\nuniversity system who\nusually have an editorial\nboard, is left with the sole\nresponsibility of producing\na rag mag. For the\ninformation of those who\nhave never done anything\nof that sort this is an\nincredibly difficult job the\ncollecting of material,\nsoliciting of advertisements,\nthe production of\ncompleted artwork; which\ntakes several months. Due\nto the aforementioned\nSteve Marshall rag mag a set of guidelines were\nproposed by the UGM of\nthat year that the\nsabbaticals had to approve\nthe artwork copy before it\nwas sent to the printers and\nremove offending material.\nHowever the UGM, in its\ninfinite wisdom, failed to\ngive any guidelines as to\nwhat it considered\noffensive and decided to\nleave that up to the\nsabbaticals' own personal\ntastes. This is not an ideal\nsituation, in fact it is a pathetic situation. The\nUGM should have decided\nwhat it considered was\noffensive and not left the\ndecision to two or three\npeople whose views cannot\nbe representative of the\nmajority, I happen to be\nvery liberally minded and\ncan take things in the spirit\nthat they are meant and as\nsuch am not the ideal judge\nof what is offensive. Having\nbeen placed in the position\nof censor my judgement\nshould be criticised, and\nrightly so, since I have no\nguidelines as to what to\nexcise from the rag mag\nwhich are acceptable to the\nmajority of students at\nImperial College.\nI feel that if we are to\ncontinue to produce a rag\nmag we need:-1. UGM guidelines as to what\nshould not be allowed to be\nprinted.\n2. All completed artwork\ncopy must be submitted to\nthe sabbaticals for approval\nsubject to 1 before being\nsent to the printers.\n3. The printing of the\npublications must not be\nallowed to go ahead until the\nPresident has given his\nwritten agreement subject to\n2 that it should do so, and\nthis must be made known to\nthe printer on receipt of the\ncontract.\nA Rag mag can be\nindividual, a rag mag can\nbe funny but we have a duty to make it something\nwe can show to the people\nwho we are collecting for\nand not something the\ncharities will not put their\nnames to.\no:3 If you have strong views on any subject OPINION is\nyour chance to reach a College-wide audience.\nEach week FELIX will give a student the chance to\npublish their opinion on a subject of his/her own\nchoice. If you want to contribute then contact Hugh\nSouthey in the FELIX Office.\nFELIX Monday 30 September 19\n\n"

    "content": "Rector's Reception\nDear Sir\nI remember my first\nUnion General Meeting. I took my seat amongst the\nother thousand fresher s, eager to hear what Gaynor\nLewis, then ICU President,\nhad to say about life in\nImperial College as a student, how ICU was\ngoing to help me spend the\nnext three years, and make\nmy grant last for the\nduration.\nAfter the official greeting\nfrom the Rector, it was the\nUnion's turn. I was sadly\ndisappointed as we were\nsubjected to a few very\nclique y jokes which sent a few older Union hacks into\nbouts of laughter and left\nme and all of the other\nfresher s bored and\nmystified. This was\nfollowed by Mines\nattacking most people with\nflower, water and whatever\nelse came to hand.\nNeedless to say many,\nincluding myself, were put\nright off the Union in less\nthan an hour.\nNow having seen this\nyears I.C.U. Handbook we\nare confronted by a half\nnaked Carl Burgess with no\nhair, covered in shaving\nfoam. Inside the Handbook\nis very good but look at the\nfirst impression it gives to\nstudents before they get to\ncollege, and think what it\ndoes for their parents who\nprobably don't read inside.\nThis is not some sort of\nzoo, and I really think that\nthe union ought to get its\nact together with regards to\nits image. ICU has got\nsomething to offer to\nCollege life but whilst it\nmaintains an air of idiocy,\nintelligent students will not\nget involved. If it were to\nuse FELIX, probably the\nbest college newspaper in\nthe country, to improve this\nimage promoting some of\nthe best things in college -maybe the large S CC societies like Wellsoc and\nInd Soc - and then tidy up\non the quality of the\nUGM's. a bit, making them\nless outlandish, students\nmay even listen.\nYours faithfully\nPaul Basham\nPhysics 3\nSquatters\nDear Editor,\nI would like to draw your\nattention, and that of\nHamlet Gardens residents,\nto the situation in flat 140.\nDuring the summer, these\nflats are let to a members\nof the public by college\u2014in\nImperial\nCollege\nUnion\nHandbook\n1985\nThis is your President\n-What have you fet yourself in for?\nreality this means\nunemployed Irish-bast az ds youths who fancy an\nindefinite holiday in\nLondon.\nThree of these, a Declan\nSlevin, Robert Kane and\nPhilip Behan, who were\nliving in 140 instead of\nmoving out when they had\nbeen told, and agreed to do\nso in writing, and were\nlegally obliged to do so so\nunder Scheme 15 Part II\ncase 14 of the Rent Act\n1977, decided that it would\nbe really cool to change\nthe lock, board up the front\ndoor and call themselves\nsquatters.\nThanks to these 'free\nspirits' who are 'fighting\nback against the system'\n(we get a lot of these at\nSummer Lettings), six\ngenuinely needful students\nhave been deprived of a flat.\nSo why can't college\nmove them out? Well, they\ncan, but it takes 6 weeks to\ndo so. Any attempts to\nspeed this process by\nh arras s ment, violence or\nthreat, or kicking the door\nin, pinning everyone in\nsight to the ground and\nthrowing out all their\npossessions (not the telly,\nthat's ours) by persons\nacting on behalf of the\ncollege is an offense.\nHowever, ordinary students\nwho happen to be resident\nin Hamlet would not be\nacting on behalf of the\ncollege...\nI hope this letter will not\nbe misconstrued as an\nincitement to cause any\nkind of h arras ment, as I am\nmerely pointing out the\nfacts. I would also like to\npoint out that I am no\nlonger an employee at\nHamlet Gardens, and\ntherefore my interest in the\nmatter is purely as a student, in no connection\nwith college authority.\nYours Frustratedly,\nPaul Bloomfield\nEx-Assistant Manager\nHamlet Gardens.\nRag Mag\nDear Sir,\nSince ICU President Carl is\nallowed to make a whole\npage presentation of his\ncase, please let me put\nforward Rag's case in this\nhumble way.\nIn the Opinion column,\nCarl has stated that Rag\nMags do not produce\nmoney as a prime aim, and\nare aimed to outdo Steve\nMarshall's production.\nWhere previous Rag\nMags were banned by\nUGM's this decision has\nalways been overturned by\nlater UGM's, with the only\nloser being Rag ie loss of\nmoney donated to charities.\nThe adoption of clearer\nrules for all IC publications\nis a good idea, even though\nbrought about by the\nin competences of this\nyear's Exec.\nWith respect to the\nalternative view, I would\nlike to make a few points.\nFirstly, Freshers' will not\nhave seen the Rag Mag,\nand very few students have\nseen a copy of SM's(1980) since they have been so\nwell selling that none are\nleft.\nLast year, RCS started\nRag Tours around the\ncountry selling old rag\nmags. They were received\nwell, over 7,000 were sold\nand over \u00a32,000 profit\nmade, which went to Rag.\nPeople liked out different\nstyle.\nRag Committee decided\nthat a similar style ought to\nbe continued this year, and\nhave affirmed that it ought\nto be sold in its present\nform. Apart from the\nom mission of the printers\nname (his fault as it was\nremoved from the artwork\nsupplied), the ICU solicitor\nsays that we will have no\nproblems with the content.\nCarl Burgess was editor of\nour last Rag Mag, and even\nLondon Student (not\nknown for its pro IC\nstance) say that this years\nis almost ident i al \u2014except\nless racist\u2014than Carl's. The Exec had ample\nopportunity to censor (and\nthey did), but have\nchanged their minds after\nthe return of the Rag Mag\nfrom the printers. This may\nwell result in the waste of\n\u00a31500 of Union money.\nLastly, as Editor, I have\nmade a great effort to\nincrease profitability for the\nRag Mag, by including\nadvertising and finding a cheaper printer, so that the\ncost per copy is almost\nhalved (22p \u201413p).I have\nfound advertisers who will\nnot advertise next year if\nwe do not sell these Rag\nMag's. In addition, even\npotential purchasers will\nmiss out on the opportunity\nof a free half pint of Firkin\nbeer at any Bruce's Brewery pub.\nTo formulate your own\nideas, talk to Carl, to me (at\nRCSU) and read FELIX Nos\n709, 710, 712, and 713\n(freely available in FELIX\nOffice) and ask to read, a copy of this year's Rag Mag\nand Carl's Rag Mag in ICU\n(for information purposes)\nbefore Thursday'sU GM and make up you own\nmind.\nTony Spencer\nRag Mag Editor\nn FELIX Monday 30 September 3\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX: Could you start by\ntelling us something of\nyour background, family,\nhome and childhood?\nAsh: I was born in\nGermany. My family\nemigrated to this country in\n1938 when I was ten years\nold. I have one sister. My\nfather was a lawyer. I went\nto University College\nSchool and subsequently to\na place called Imperial\nCollege, City and Guilds.\nSince then I have acquired\none wife and five\ndaughters.\nF: When you were at\nImperial were you involved\nin the Union? What sort of\nsocial life did you have?\nA: I didn't have very much\nconnection with the Union.\nI participated in quite a lot\nof activities I used to go\nrowing every weekend.\nSince at that time I only\nweighed 91\n/2 stone, the only\nthing I could usefully do\nwas sculling, but I did that\nfairly religiously. There\nwasn't at that time an\norchestra at Imperial\nCollege so I played in the\norchestra at University\nCollege instead\nWhat else did I do those\ndays? Well, we had a fair\namount of social life. It\nseemed to involve the RCM quite a bit. I don't know\nwhether this still goes on or\nnot.\nF:A little.\nA: I think that is something\nto be encouraged.\nF: What musical instrument\ndo you actually play?\nA: I play the violin or the\nviola\u2014but I haven't played\nvery much for the last five\nyears so I am distinctly\nrusty.\nF: Your CV says that you\nleft IC in 1952 to go to\nStanford. From there you\nwent to QM C in 1954 and\nStandard\nTelecommunications in\n1955. Why did you move\nout of the university sector\nand why did you return to\nuniversity life in 1963?\nA: I moved out of the\nuniverity sector because I feel that industry is the\nnatural habitat for\nengineers, or at least it is\none that they ought to\nexperience. When I went\ninto industry, I had\nabsolutely no intention of\ncoming back to a university. Like everything\nelse in my life it seems to\nhave happened by\naccident.\nF: What is your research\nfield?\nA: My current field is\nprimarily developing new\nforms of imaging, in\nparticular ultra-sonic\nimaging using ac cou stic waves and thermal wave\nAsh Slams\nEducation Policy\nProfessor Eric Ash will become Rector of Imperial\nCollege tomorrow. In his first interview with FELIX\nhe discusses his background, further education\ntoday and his plans for the future.\nimaging, and also some\nnew ways of imaging with\nlight. In the past I have\nspent a lot of my time\nworking on micro-waves,\nmicro-wave tubes and solid\nstate devices in general.\nF: We noticed that you\nhave just received a major\naward from the UGC for\nyour research group. Are\nyou planning to bring your\ngroup over to Imperial?\nA: I have talked to my\ncolleagues here and my\nnew colleagues at Imperial\nabout this. I think there\nreally wouldn't be anything\nto be said in favour of\ndoing that. The group here\nis well enmeshed in the\ninfra-structure. I think if I were to take out any of my\nPhD students and ask them\nto move West, they would\nprobably lose something\nlike a year getting resettled,\nso instead I am simply\ngoing to spend a little bit of\ntime over here. However, in\nthe long run I would very\nmuch like to start some\nresearch at Imperial.\nF: Do you see yourself\nprimarily as an\nadministrator or as an\nacademic researcher?\nA: I don't think there is\nreally any choice about it. I think if one is going to play\nthe role of Rector of\nImperial College, you are\nprimarily an administrator.\nBut there isn't any reason\nwhy one needs to spend\none hundred percent of\none's time doing one thing,\nand so I very much hope\nthat I can continue to be a part-time academic.\nF: Why did you decide to\nmove out of academic\nresearch and into\nadministration?\nA: Getting a letter asking\nme whether I was prepared\nto be considered for the\nRectorship of Imperial\nCollege. Like everything\nelse in my life, it really\nwasn't planned. In fact I have turned down a number of previous\nopportunities for ViceChancellorships cheerfully\nand rapidly. To me Imperial\nCollege was different. First\nof all, I was there in my\nyouth and enjoyed it\nenormously. It is, I think,\nthe most challenging job in\nacademia - at least on the\nscience side.\nF: Would you agree with\nthe Chairman of the UGC\nSir Peter Swinnerton-Dyer's comment that it is the most\nimportant job in the\nUniversity sector?\nA: I think it would be very\nunwise of me to start\nquarrelling with Sir Peter\nSwinnerton-Dyer at this\nstage.\nF: There is a rumour going\nround College that you\nwere offered the position of\nHead of the Electrical\nEngineering Department. Is\nthere any truth in the\nrumour and, if so, why did\nyou turn it down?\nA: You mean recently?\nF: Yes.\nA: No, there's absolutely no\ntruth in this. Many years\nago there was some\ndiscussion of my moving\nfrom here to Imperial\nCollege to the Electrical\nEngineering Department,\nbut at that time I really felt\nI was so enmeshed in the\nresearch I was doing here\nthat it didn't seem sensible\nto move.\nF: Have you got any views\non the UGC report on\nImperial, in particular the\ncriticisms of teaching\nstandards?\nA: I have only seen an\nabstract of this report,\nmaybe in the Times Higher\nEducational Supplement.\nObviously I don't have\nviews on this. My\nknowledge of Imperial\nCollege dates back about\nthirty three years. Since\nthen I have only had\nintermittent contact with a few of my colleagues. I obviously don't have an\noverview at all.\nF: How do you think IC has\nchanged since you were an\nundergraduate here?\nA: I think that in a third of a century a place changes so\nmuch that it is hardly\nworthwhile trying to make\nthe comparison; of course,\nall the buildings are new\nand the place must have\ndoubled in size. I suspect\nthat what I remember from\nmy student days won't really help very much at\nthis stage. I know a bit\nabout it from current\ncontacts. At the moment,\nfor example, I am the\nexternal examiner for the\napplied optics course in the\nPhysics Department.\nF: What are your views on\nthe present government's policies on higher\neducation and on the\nrecent green paper in\nparticular?\nA: Well I have of course\nread the green paper, but\nnot with any great\nenthusiasm. I do have to\nsay that I believe we have\nno alternative but to\nredirect our resources\ntowards the applied\nsciences. To that extent, I would go along with one of\nthe themes in the green\npaper. What I find\nimmensely depressing is\nthe view that the resources\nthat we are devoting to\nhigher education at the\nmoment can, at best, be\nkept constant. In spite of\neverything this is an\naffluent society and\neducation has a value quite\napart from its ability to\nback up industry. I feel that\n8 Monday 30 September FELIX\n\n"
