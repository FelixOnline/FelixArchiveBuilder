Some scientists are pinning their\nhopes on using the building blocks of life to help solve the issue.\nSCIENCE\nVarshit Dusad\nScience Writer\nD\nata has been\nhailed as the\noil of this\ncentury. Just\nlike oil, entire industries\nrely on data analytics to\ndevelop consumer-centric\nproducts, which are nowadays in constant demand.\nGoogle Search, Facebook\nRecommendations, and\npretty much everything\nelse on the Internet has\nbecome part of new\n\u2018Data Economy\u2019. Every\nsingle day a large mass\nof data is created and\nstored: a joint research\nproject by Seagate, the\nworld\u2019s leading hard\ndrive manufacturer, and\nIDC analytics, predicts\nthat the total amount of\ndata worldwide will reach\n163 Zettabytes (ZB) by\nthe year 2025 \u2013 a tenfold\nincrease from the 16.1 ZB\ngenerated in 2016. To put\ninto perspective, one ZB\nis equal to a trillion GB.\nThis is an explosive rate\nof data generation! Much\nof this data is managed\nby few large tech giants\nlike Google, Facebook,\nAmazon, and Microsoft,\n\u201cEntire\nindustries\nrely on data\nanalytics\nto develop\nconsumer-centric\nproducts\u201d\n\u201cWhy is DNA\nstorage not\nmainstream?\nBecause both\nsynthesising\nand\nsequencing\nDNA are\nvery slow\nsequences\u201d\nmeasures. The solution?\nRecently there has been\nan interest in replacing\nmagnetic tapes and sil-icon-based hard drives\nwith DNA, which could\nbe the next generation of\nstorage.\nThough you may find\nit surprising, using DNA\nfor information storage is\nnot as strange as you may\nthink. Nature has always\nused DNAto encode all of\nlife\u2019s genetic information,\nand the latest research has\nused its innate properties\nto store digital informa-tion. In 2012, the Church\nlab at Harvard University\ndisplayed the potential of\nDNA as storage platform\nby encoding a 53,426\nword book, eleven JPG\nimages, and one Javascript\nprogram using next-gen-eration DNA synthesis\nand sequencing platforms.\nDigital information is\nstored as strings of binary\ndigits (bits) holding only\nthe values as zeroes\nand ones, while genetic\ninformation is stored\nin a sequence of four\nchemical bases \u2013Adenine,\nGuanine, Cytosine, and\nThymine. In both cases, it\nis the sequence and rules\nof interpretation which\nencode the information.\nBy mapping the bits to\nbase sequences, one can\ntransfer digital information to its chemical\nequivalent. To access the\ninformation, the DNA is\nsequenced, and sequences\nof eight bases used to\nretrieve the digital infor-mation.\nWhat advantages can\nthis bring? Well, one gram\nof DNA can store 215\npetabytes (PB). While\nconventional hard drives\nlast for an average of\n5fiveyears, DNA is far\nmore resilient \u2013 in fact, it\nis one of the most stable\nchemicals found on Earth,\nbeing found preserved\nin remains thousands of\nyears old, despite harsh\nconditions. Some have\neven called DNA apocalypse proof! If humanity\nsuffers a disaster, then\nfuture generations will\nbe able to access the information stored on DNA\nmemory sticks to recreate\nour civilization.\nSo,whyisDNAstorage\nnot yet mainstream?\nBecause both the steps of\nchemically synthesizing\nDNA and sequencing are\nslow processes \u2013 very\nslow compared to the\nlightning fast information\nstorage and retrieval we\nare used to. Furthermore,\nthe sequencing process is\nerror prone, with the error\nincreasing with increasing\nlengths of DNA. The other\nissue is that sequencing\nis a linear, end to end\nprocess and, without a\nrobust encoding scheme,\nit is very challenging\nto retrieve make data\nrandomly accessible. For\nexample, if you wanted\nto find a key passage on\na book written on DNA\nthen you will have to read\nThree cheers for DNA // Flickr\nConnect with Conservation \u2013 de-extinction\ndilemma\nSCIENCE\nSteve Allain\nScience Writer\nY\nou may be\naware that\nthere are\nc u r r e n t l y\ngrowing efforts to clone\nlong-extinct animals\nsuch as mammoths,\nwhich would be sure\nto put a smile on John\nHammond\u2019s face. There\nis a growing consensus\nin the scientific community that we should\nuse similar technology\nto resurrect recently\nextinct animals. There\nare a number of criteria\na species must fit into,\nin order to be selected\nas a potential candidate,\nincluding preservation\nof viable genetic material and the existence of\nsuitable habitat for rein-troduction. We are not\ntalking about a mosquito\nin amber here; instead,\nthe species for which\nsuch a project could be\nviable are those that have\nbecome extinct within\nthe past 100 years. There\nmay be potential along the\nway to learn more about\nAs an Amphibian Biologist, I could not help\nbut pick this first example\n\u2013 the gastric brooding\nfrog (Rheobatrachus\nspp.). There were two\nclosely related species\nthat were discovered in\nthe latter half of the 20th\ncentury, shortly before\nthey became extinct. They\nacquired their name from\nthe unusual behaviour\nexhibited by the females\nincubating their eggs:\nthey would swallow the\nfertilised eggs and convert\ntheir stomach into a frog\nnursery, before regurgitating fully-formed froglets\napproximately six weeks\nlater. During this time,\nthe mother shuts down all\nfunction of her stomach\nand does not eat until her\nbrood have developed. In\n2013, scientists in Australia successfully created\na living embryo from preserved genetic material,\nwith the next goal being\nthe production of an\nembryo that can survive\nto the tadpole stage.\nThe second species is\nthe Thylacine or Tasmanian tiger (Thylacinus cy-nocephalus), which was a\nmarsupial predator hunted\nto extinction by mankind.\nThey were already on the\nway out before a bounty\nwas put on their head, but\nit certainly did not help\nthings! The Australian\nMuseum in Sydney began\na cloning project in 1999\nwith efforts still ongoing,\nusing ethanol-fixed tissue\nfrom a handful of spec-imens. There are deep\nethical questions that\nneed to be addressed with\nsuch projects, but hopefully one day passenger\npigeons will fill the skies\nonce again, and species\nextinction will be a thing\nof the past. If we have\nthe means to restore a\nspecies, especially one\nthat disappeared due to\nour direct actions, surely\nwe have an obligation to\ndo so.\nOne of the last photos of a living Tasmanian tiger // Wikimedia\n\u201cCurrent\nefforts to clone\nlong-extinct\nanimals are\nsure to put a\nsmile on John\nHammond\u2019s\nface\u201d\ndevelopmental processes,\nwhich may help to inform\nfuture medicine.

Though they\ncan\u2019t be used for quick\nretrieval of information,\nthey can act as valuable\nback-up for archived data.\nIn July 2016, Microsoft,\nin collaboration with\nUniversity of Washington,\nstored 200 megabytes of\ndata in DNA, including\na music video. 200 MB\nmight appear much lower\nthan what is desired, but\nthe real limit is cost, and\nnot science.

To reduce cost,\nMicrosoft partnered\nwith Twist Bioscience, a\nsynthetic biology start-up.\nTwist Bioscience, using\ntheir proprietary synthesis\ntechnology, provides rapid\nand cost-effective DNA\non demand to Microsoft\nfor their data compression\nambition.\nThough Microsoft may\nbe the only tech giant\nringing DNA-based storage\u2019s praises, academics\nremain excited by the\npossibilities. Dr. Nick\nGoldman at European\nBioinformatics Institute is\ndriving research to make\nDNA data storage reliable\nand competent. In 2013, a\nyear after Church\u2019s proof\nof concept, he developed\nan improved strategy\nto encode digital data\ninto biological text.

The International\nJoint Research Unit will\nhave equal status with its\nFrench counterpart, meaning that the academics\nworking there will have\nthe same access to funding as their counterparts\nacross the Channel. It\u2019s\na little piece of stability,\namid the floating sea of\nawful uncertainty that is\nBrexit. Three cheers for\ncollaboration!\nElsewhere, however,\nthings aren\u2019t looking so\nbright. This March, it will\nhavebeenthreeyearssince\nthe \u2018misogyny at Varsity\u2019\nincident. For those of you\nwho weren\u2019t here when it\nhappened \u2013 or were, but\ndon\u2019t follow sports (don\u2019t\nblame you) \u2013 IC Women\u2019s\nRugby were scheduled to\nclose out the 2015 Varsity\nwith the headline match.\nIt was meant to be a\ntriumphant celebration of\nwomen in sport, shaking\nthings up, and making\nchange. Things didn\u2019t go\nto plan, however \u2013 the\ncoaches left early, the\nfood left out for the team\nwas cold and half-eaten,\nand Imperial staff were\noverheard making derogatory comments about the\nplayers. All in all a bit of a\nshitshow really.\nIn response, to this\nincident and others, the\nCollege commissioned an\ninvestigation to look into\nthe institutional culture of\nImperial. It concluded that\nthere were problems with\nharassment and bullying,\npeople didn\u2019t know where\nto go for help, and one\nparticipant spoke of a\nculture of misogyny that\nwas so deep as to be ingrained within Imperial\u2019s\nvery structures. It made\nfor depressing reading.\nOf course, the College\nsaid that lessons should\nand would be learned\nfrom the report. But that\nwas then, and this is now.\nHas anything changed\nin the three years since,\nreally? Since coming into\nthis role, I\u2019ve come into\ncontact with a vast array\nof people \u2013 way more\nthan I had previously in\nmy self-imposed exile to\nmedic-land \u2013 and the same\ntopics keep cropping up.\nI hear stories of\nstudents who have been\nmade to feel uncomfortable at constituent union\ndinners, after being forced\nto recount their sexual\nexperiences, eventually\njust leaving early; I\u2019ve\nspoken to people whose\nlecturers have told them\nthat women \u201cfind science\nharder\u201d, and crack jokes\nabout them being carried\nalong by the men in their\ngroup; and I speak to\nsports players who feel\nthat women\u2019s clubs don't\nget the attention they need\nto develop or blossom. It\nhappens too often for this\nto just be a few chance incidents \u2013 something needs\nto be done.\nOver the next few\nweeks, Felix will be\ncarrying out a project\nlooking at misogyny\nat Imperial.

But how do these episodes compare to\nseasons past? We take you through the highs, the lows, and the weird.\nTV\nAndrew Melville\nTV Editor\n\u201c\u2018Arkangel\u2019\nstands out as\none of only\ntwo episodes\nanywhere near\nthe quality\nof earlier\nseasons\u201d\nBlack Mirror\u2019s fourth\nseason kicks off with a\nturn away from the dark,\nnihilistic tones of earlier\nseasons, opting instead\nfor a campy parody of a\nsci-fi classic. Many critics\nhave hailed the opening\nepisode as the best of the\nseason and it\u2019s easy to see\nwhy: the story is cohesive,\nengaging, and well deliv-ered. In the context of any\nshow other than Black\nMirror, \u2018USS Callister\u2019\nwould comfortably pass\nby unnoticed.\nHowever, Black Mirror\nis not just any other show,\nand a passable episode that\nlacks the edge that fans\nhave come to expect from\ncreator Charlie Brooker\nshould not come anywhere\nnear the premiere to a new\nseason. Were \u2018USS Callister\u2019 in any of the show\u2019s\nprevious seasons, I would\nexpect to find it tucked\naway as fourth or fifth\nbilling, so as not to call\nattention to itself. Unfortunately, Season 4 already\nhas those positions of\nmediocrity filled by shy,\naverage episodes, so a\nsappy Star Trek parody\nis dropped into first place\n\u2013 and \u2018USS Callister\u2019definitely is more parody than\nhomage, complete with\nsnipes at its predecessor\u2019s\nindulgence of young male\nfantasies and simple set\ndesign. It does, however,\nuse this precis to make\nan interesting comparison\nbetween the \u2018nerdy virgin\u2019\nstereotype of the \u201880s and\n\u201890s, and the \u2018virgin neckbeard\u2019 of today, a link that\nis left largely unexplored.\nUnlike the majority\nof Black Mirror\u2019s many\nhorror stories, this\ncamp fireside tale has a\nhappy ending, with very\nlittle lost. For a show\nthat thrives on its dark\nwarnings against tech, this\nis an odd choice, and the\nthematic shift away from\nskepticism is mirrored in\nother episodes across this\nseason. This episode isn\u2019t\nthe first to end on a wholly\nhappy note, as \u2018San\nJunipero\u2019 from season 3\nends with a wholesome\nromance. However,\n\u2018USS Callister\u2019 does not\nshare the slow reveal of\ninformation leading to an\nengaging twist that gave\n\u2018San Junipero\u2019 its compelling narrative. AM\nThe disappointing\naftertaste of \u2018USS Callister\u2019 is immediately\nremedied with a return to\nwhat Brooker does best:\nintroducing a plausible\ntechnology and allowing\nthe characters\u2019 own decisions on how they use it to\nbe the force that drives the\nstory forward. Showing\nus how humans naturally\nabuse the abilities that\ntechnology facilitate\nmakes for a much scarier\nreality than the Tech ex\nMachina deployed in\nepisodes like \u2018Metalhead\u2019.\nHowever, some may\nsee the moral points raised\nin Jodie Foster\u2019s directing\ndebut as obvious, and\nless complex than similar\nepisodes from previous\nseasons. I find that this is\nan unfair analysis: what\nBlack Mirror excels at is\nbuckling us in, letting us\nknow where the episode\nis headed, and plowing on\ntowards our destination\nwith the viewer powerless\nto stop it. But \u2018Arkangel\u2019\nis unable to solely rely\non this tactic, as, for\nthis episode structure to\nhold up, the plot must\nnot depend on the erratic\nunreasonable reactions of\ncharacters.\nSome critics have\nsuggested that the episode\ndoes not venture far\nenough from the obvious\nmoral questions, noting\nthe missed opportunity for\nthe exploration of themes\nother than helicopter par-enting. While \u2018Arkangel\u2019\nis certainly a fantastic\npremise, backed by fantastic young acting talent,\nsome may also find the\nepisode does not venture\nfar enough from the most\nobvious ethical questions.\nDespite this, \u2018Arkangel\u2019\nstands out as one of only\ntwo episodes this season\nthat feel anywhere near\nto the Black Mirror of\nseasons 1 and 2, ending\nwith that warm, familiar\nsinking feeling that I\nwant from an hour of\nTV. \u2018Arkangel\u2019 is merely\na turn back to quality we\nsaw in season 3, and not\na step forward. For Black\nMirror to remain relevant\n(which it almost certainly\nhas ample opportunity to)\nit must not settle for the\nobvious questions and\nmore obvious answers.\nAM\nUnion Council looked pretty different this year // Wikimedia\nDirector: Jodie Foster.\nScript: Charlie Brooker.\nStarring: Rosemarie\nDeWitt, Brenna Harding,\nOwen Teague.\nARKANGEL\nDirector: John Hillcoat.\nScript: Charlie Brooker.\nStarring: Andrea\nRiseborough, Kiran Sonia\nSawar, Andrew Gower.\nCROCODILE\nDirector: Toby Haynes.\nScript: Charlie Brooker,\nWilliam Bridges.

It\u2019s a\ndifficult thing to get right,\nas evidenced by \u2018Crocodile\u2019, which is by far the\nworst episode of the new\nseries thanks to its refusal\nto represent anything\ncoming remotely close to\nactual human behaviour.\nThis time the technology is a device that reads\nyour memories, the setting\nis somewhere in Scandinavia where everyone\nhas massive houses, and\nthe human instinct is\u2026\na propensity to violently\nmurder people? Starring\nAngela Riseborough as an\narchitect whose boyfriend\nruns down a cyclist,\n\u2018Crocodile\u2019 explores the\nclassic idea that small\nlies lead to big lies, but\nprogresses at too fast a\npace to allow us to believe\nin its storyline. In a desperation to draw blood,\nBrooker\u2019s script has Riseborough\u2019s character going\ndown a road away from\nplausible humanity, and\nthe result is a schlocky,\ncampy episode. Even\nits payoff at the end is\nlaughable, like something\nout of The Scary Door.\nRiseborough is excellent,\nas are her co-stars Kiran\nSonia Sawar and Andrew\nGower, but they are\nworking with exceptionally poor material.

Unfortunately,\nthis is where the parallels\nbetween the two end,\nand \u2018Hang the DJ\u2019 falls\nshort of delivering the\nsame punch that made\n\u2018San Junipero\u2019 season 3\u2019s\nstandout episode.\nWhere \u2018San Junipero\u2019\nearned its merit was in the\nslow, methodical reveal of\ninformation that twisted\nthe viewers\u2019 perceptions\nof the reality presented\nuntil the episode finally\n\u2018clicks\u2019. In \u2018Hang the DJ\u2019\nwe are lead down no such\ntrack, with only scattered\ncomments by Frank on\nhis doubts about reality\nand the tenuous fact that\npebbles seem to always\nbounce four times to\nindicate that something is\namiss. This is less a hint\nand more of a reveal in\nitself, as from this point\nonwards the viewer is\njust left to wait until the\nepisode is ready to reveal\nthat Frank and Amy are\njust living in a simulation\n\u2013 realistically, there is no\nother possibility.\nWhere the episode\nreally falls short of the\nstandard expected is in\nits final minutes, where\nwe learn that 998 out of\nthe 1000 Frank and Amy\nsimulations realised that\nthe dating game was just\na test. Not only does this\nraise somewhat alarming\nquestions about what the\nepisode has to say about\nmodern dating (thatTinder\nand its ilk have gamified\nthe dating process?), but\nalso does not seem to\nprovide any solid reason\nfor claiming that the pair\nare a 99.8% match. Would\nthey have passed the test\nif they had decided to\nescape the simulation\nalone? Earlier seasons of\nBlack Mirror have not\nrelied on chance character\ndecisions, at least on this\nscale, and the dependence\non such this season shows\na decline in the quality to\nbe expected of the show\ngoing forward. AM\nDirector: David Slade.\nScript: Charlie Brooker.\nStarring: Maxine Peake,\nClint Dyer, Jake Davies.\nMETALHEAD\nDirector David Slade\nmight have put some\nviewers off with his\ndecision to shoot \u2018Metalhead\u2019 in black and white,\nbut the decision is bold,\nand pays off. Centring\naround a lone woman\n(Maxine Peake) escaping\nfrom a killer robot \u2013 resembling a dog, but with\nadded weaponry \u2013 \u2018Metalhead\u2019 is visually stunning,\nfrom start to finish.\nOverhead tracking shows\nemphasise the thrilling\ndesolation of the country-side, its dangerous beauty\noffset by the vicious\nrobotics on display. We\nfrequently cut from these\nwide open shots \u2013 highlighting the isolation of\nPeake\u2019s character \u2013 to\nclose-ups of her face,\ncreating a claustrophobic\natmosphere that contributes to the episode\u2019s sense\nof unease.\nIt is clear that Slade\u2019s\nintention with the episode\nis to create an unremitting\ntension within the viewer,\nand he does this well,\nputting us on the edge of\nour seats. As part of the\nBlack Mirror universe,\nhowever, something\nseems missing. It resembles a survival horror\n\u2013 albeit a very good one\n\u2013 which is a genre that\nhas been done to death\nacross TV, film, and video\ngames. And it lacks what\nsets such horrors apart \u2013 a\ngripping back story. We\u2019re\ndropped right into the\nmiddle of a post-apoca-lyptic world, with no sort\nof explanation of how\nthings got to be that way.\nThis is, obviously, a deliberate choice, but then the\nepisode ends with a reveal\nthat tries to impose some\nkind of narrative where\nthere wasn\u2019t one before\n\u2013 it leaves us wanting\nmore. There are enough\nindividual elements in\n\u2018Metalhead\u2019 to add up to\na stellar episode, but they\nnever quite come together\nto a satisfying whole. FF\nI saved the best until\nlast. I\u2019d heard from\nTwitter that this was one\nof the best episodes of the\nnew season \u2013 comparable\nto standouts from the\nprevious few \u2013 packed to\nthe brim with the juicy\ndarkness Black Mirror\nis known for. And while\n\u2018Black Museum\u2019 did\ndeliver some of the chills\nyou get when an episode\nis tapping into something\nreally deep, its structure\nmakes it difficult to appreciate as a cohesive whole.\nYes, this is one of\nthose tropes well-loved\nby writers, and usually\ndisparaged by viewers:\nthe compendium episode,\nwhere we have multiple\nindividual stories instead\nof a single one. In the\ncase of \u2018Black Museum\u2019,\nthe eponymous museum\nplays host to a number\nof gruesome artifacts and\nexhibitions, of which we\nare shows three, in short\ntwenty minute bursts. It\nbegins with its weakest\nsegment, in which a\nmedical device that allows\na doctor to feel what their\npatient feels goes badly\nwrong \u2013 not because of\nany instinct of human\nnature, but rather because\nit simply malfunctions.\nThis is then followed by\ntwo better parts, which \u2013\ndespite some flaws \u2013 lead\nup to a conclusion that is\ngenuinely surprising.\nBut no amount of shock\ncan disguise the fact that\nthis episode isn\u2019t an exceptional idea stretched\nto its logical conclusion,\nbut three reasonable ideas\ntacked together, none of\nwhich are explored fully.\nIt\u2019s not an awe-inspiring\nend to the season, but\nit certainly remains one\nof the highlights of the\nlackluster set of episodes\non offer.

This\nstem-cell derived retinal\nepithelium was observed\nto spontaneously form\nepithelial vesicles, the\nflexible distal portion of\nwhich folded inward to\nform a shape resonant\nwith the embryonic optic\ncup. It is an excellent\nexample of how organoid\ndevelopment often\nstrongly resembles natural\nembryonic development\nin vivo, giving researchers\nthe opportunity to study\ndevelopmental processes\nand organogenesis (the\ndevelopment of organs).\nSome methods for generating organoids from\nembryonic stem cells\ninvolve providing cells\nwith minimum differentiation information and\nenabling them to self-or-ganise. Other methods\nprovide stem cells with\nsignalling that is known\nto result in the differentiation into specific cells\ntypes. Regardless of the\nmethod employed, the\nresulting organoids can\nbe used to increase our\nunderstanding of human\nprocesses and develop-ment, including disease.\nOrganoids are especially\nuseful for the study of\ngenetic disorders that\nexert their malignancy\nin utero, and do not have\naccurate animal models.\nCerebral organoids were\nrecently used to model\naspects of lissencephaly,\na brain disorder in which\nthe brain itself does not\nexhibit the usual folds\nseen in the cerebral cortex.\nThis research identified\na mitotic defect in glia,\na cell type important in\nhuman cortical develop-ment.\nWhile being an\nincredibly useful tool,\norganoids are far from\nthe perfect models for\nstudy. A significant issue\nthat arises from the use\nof in vitro organoids is\nthe lack of a vasculature\nto sustain growth and\ndevelopment of organoids\npast foetal stages. It is not\nyet possible to introduce\nfunctional blood vessels\ninto petri dish organoids,\nand current research is\nonly able to link organoids\nto a circulatory system by\ntransplanting them into\nlive animals. Perhaps in\nthe future, more complex\nin vitro organoids will\narise, with researchers\neventually being able to\ngrow entire human organs.\nT\nhe applications of\nrobots span many\ndisciplines \u2013 far\nbeyond what\none might see on BBC\u2019s\nRobot Wars. Robots\nthemselves have long had\nseveral applications in the\nmedical field, but only\nrecently have researchers demonstrated the\neffectiveness of their use\nfor tissue regeneration.\nAt Boston\u2019s Children\u2019s\nHospital, researchers conducted a proof-of-concept\nstudy using a tissue-re-generating robot on the\noesophagi of five pigs.\nThe robot consists of two\nmotorised rings and an\nexternal control unit; as\nit is only attached to the\noesophagus, it does not\naffect other organs. The\nmotorised attachments, in\nthe form of rings sutured\nto both ends of the oesoph-agus, place traction forces\non the tube via a control\nunit external to the body.\nThe magnitude of traction\nforces can be adjusted\nusing this programmable\ncontrol unit, and the robot\npulls the oesophagus in\nboth directions either with\nmore or less force. A skin-like barrier surrounds the\ndevice to protect the motorised unit from various\nbodily fluids. It is widely\nknown that mechanical\nforces and mechanotrans-duction in cells play an\nimportant role in tissue\ngrowth, and this robot\nlooks to take advantage of\nthat knowledge.\nDuring this study,\nresearchers increased the\nring separation distance\nby 2.5mm each day, in all\nfive pigs for either eight or\nnine days. This separation\nstrained the oesophagus,\nand therefore induced mechanical forces. After the\n2.5mm separation each\nday, the mechanical forces\non the oesophagi were\nmeasured. Following ring\nseparation, these forces\nimmediately increased\nproportionally to the\nseparation distance, and\nexponentially decayed in\nthe day following sepa-ration, indicating tissue\nproliferation. The oe-sophagi lengthened with\nincreasing ring separation\ndistance, as the circumference and thickness of the\nmuscular layer surrounding the oesophagi were\nmaintained, showing that\nlengthening, as opposed\nto stretching, was indeed\noccurring. On average,\nthe pig oesophagi lengthened by 77%. This result\nis ground-breaking, as\nthe right amount of force\nneeded to be applied to\ntissue to promote growth\nis as of yet unknown.\nIn vivo tissue engineering is typically done using\ncell-seeded scaffolds,\nwhich induce cell prolif-eration, but may fail due\nto lag-time of vascularisa-tion or the hosts immune\nresponse. Robotic\nimplants for tissue regeneration mitigate these\nchallenges. Due to this\nnovel tissue-generating\nrobot, oesophageal atresia\nand short bowel syndrome\n\u2013 two conditions that\nare usually birth defects\nwhich cause years of\ndiscomfort \u2013 may have\nfound their cure. This\nnovel application is a\npotential replacement\nfor otherwise invasive,\nrisky surgeries with long\nrecovery periods. The\nteam plans to next test the\ndevice on large animal\nmodels before moving\non to clinical trials in the\nfuture.\n\u201cSiri, find me a picture of science\u201d // CC\nAn intestinal organoid, viewed under a microscope // Wikimedia\n\n"

Not\nhaving watched the interview from the beginning,\nI didn\u2019t know what the\nnovel was about, but I\nwas intrigued by their\ndiscussion of Arab culture\nand traditions. When I\nlearnt that the book follows a gay Arab man in an\nunnamed Arab country, I\nknew I had to read it.\nThe novel follows one\nday in the life of Rasa,\na twenty seven-year-old\ngay man, living with his\ngrandmother, who in the\nbook represents the voice\nof societal expectations.\nIt is set in an Arab city\nrocked by the events of\nthe Arab Spring. The day\nbegins with his grandmother finding him in bed\nwith Taymour, his lover\nof three years, whose\nwedding Rasa is to attend\nthat very evening.\nAs we follow Rasa\nthroughout this day we get\na clear, vivid insight into\nthe political uprisings, his\nupbringing, Arab culture\nand tradition, and the\nrespite that Guapa, a bar\nwith an underground gay\nclub, brings him.\nFrankly, I was quite\nsurprised by how well\nHaddad handled such\ndifficult themes with\nrelative ease. He was able\nto capture so well how\nstifling some cultural and\ntraditional expectations\ncan be \u2013 expectations that\nare based on a nonsensical\ninheritance of traditions\npassed religiously down\nevery generation. He\ndeftly showed how the\nconcept embodied by a\nsmall word like eib, or\nshame, can be used to\ndictate one\u2019s behaviour\nlest you draw too much\nattention to yourself. And,\nof course, let us not forget\nthe all too important\nquestion attached to every\naction one commits: What\nwould people say?\nBeing an Arab myself,\nI completely understand\nhow rigid society\u2019s definition of what is acceptable\ncan be, and how reluctant\npeople seem to be to do\nanything, no matter how\ninsignificant the action,\nfor fear of how others\nwould perceive it. Haddad\nwas able to depict these restrictions and their consequences so well in Mimi,\nRasa\u2019s old high school\nfriend. Seated beside Rasa\nduring the wedding, she\nkeeps leaning in, whispering to him her little\nsecrets \u2013 how overbearing\nher mother-in-law is, how\nshe regrets never doing\nwhat she wanted but what\nsociety demanded of her.\nWhile the novel is\neasy to read, the writing\ndid seem slightly stilted\nat times and one can tell\nthat this is indeed a debut\nnovel. But that does not\ndetract from the important themes it considers;\nHaddad has masterfully\nhandled many crucial\nand difficult topics.\nRasa\u2019s grandmother is the\nepitome of a domineering\nArab matriarch, so faithfully depicted, especially\nthrough her speeches,\nwhich made me laugh to\nthe point of tears at times.\nIn my opinion, it is high\ntime that we have an open,\ntransparent dialogue of\nhomosexuality in the Arab\nworld. We all know or\nhave heard of a gay Arab\nperson, but steadfastly\nrefuse to confront it and\nhave a serious conversation about it. Some are\nstrongly opposed to it, due\nto religious and cultural\nreasons, while others\ntolerate it as long as it is\nSaleem Haddad\u2019s first novel Guapa follows a day in the life of a gay man in an Arab city, questioning deep-set\nsocietal expectations\nSaleem Haddad, author of Guapa // Sami Haddad\n\u201cHe deftly\nshowed how\nthe concept\nembodied by a\nsmall word like\neib, or shame,\ncan be used to\ndictate one\u2019s\nbehaviour\u201d\nkept out of their sight.\nAlthough countries like\nBahrain and Jordan have\nnot criminalised homo-sexuality, LGBTQ individuals still face discrimination if they outwardly\ndisplay their sexuality.\nThe majority of the Gulf\nStates have prison terms\n\u201cHaddad has\nmasterfully\nhandled so\nmany crucial\nand difficult\nthemes\u201d\nfor male homosexuality,\nand it is punishable by\ndeath in Saudi Arabia and\nIraq. I believe these views\nare slowly, but surely,\nevolving.\nMy visit to Liverpool\nin summer coincided with\nPride. I was transfixed\nby the intense energy the\nparticipants brought to the\ncity, through the music of\nthe marching bands, the\nchoreographed dances,\nand the sheer number of\nparticipants. I saw people\nbearing flags from various\nMiddle Eastern countries\nincluding Iran, Kuwait,\nand Oman. There were\na few protestors voicing\ntheir discontent, but that\nhardly affected the festival\u2019s atmosphere.\nConsidering the more\nprogressive views of the\nyounger generations, a\ndiscussion on treatment\nof LGBTQ Arabs needs\nto be had; hopefully, this\nnovel will encourage it.\n\n"

As\nLiam tell me: \u201ceSports\nhave been growing in\npopularity for a number\nof years now, with people\nable to compete against\nfriends and develop themselves as professionals,\nwhich was previously not\npossible.\u201d\nnearly 4,000 tournaments,\nshelling out $111 million\nto top players.\nWriting for The Verge,\nBen Popper identifies\nthe release of Starcraft\nII in 2010 as a key\nturning point: the game,\na science-fiction real\ntime strategy game in\nwhich you play as one of\nthree main species, \u201cwas\nembraced by a global\ncommunity of rabid fans\nwho had been playing its\npredecessor for more than\na decade.\u201d\nBut while eSports\nremains largely centred\naround the Korean market,\nit is beginning to move to\nthe UK too \u2013 the British\neSports Association was\nestablished in 2016, while\nevents like Varsity highlight their prominence.\nSpeaking to Liam, he\ntells me: \u201cthe increasing\npopularity and profile of\nour Varsity reflects an\nincreasing desire to watch\ncompetitive eSports. The\nfact we\u2019re hosting an\nevent similar to traditional\nsporting events shows\nhow mainstream this is\nbecoming\u201d. Even the\nname was a deliberate\nchoice, as Roy Lee, ICU\neSports\u2019 chair tell me:\n\u201cinstead of calling this\nan eSports competition,\nwe\u2019ve chosen to call it an\neSports Varsity, to break\nthe negative perceptions\naround eSports, and show\nthe public the similarities\nbetween eSports and\ntraditional sports in universities\u201d.\nWill they ever be\nas popular as in Korea\nthough? While Liam\nadmits that \u201cthe culture\nis entirely different in\nSouth Korea\u2026 this is\nwhy they\u2019re miles better\nthan everyone else,\u201d Roy\nfeels that the next few\nyears will be vital for\neSports in the UK: \u201cWe\nare seeing strong and\naccelerated movements\nin the States due to heavy,\nfocused investments\ntowards students,\u201d he\ntells me, \u201cwhat we can\ndo as an eSports society\nin the coming years will\ndetermine whether university eSports in the UK\ncan keep up with these\ncountries in terms of its\nstandards and quality.\nCompetitions between\nuniversities shouldn\u2019t be\nlimited to within London,\nor even within the UK. We\nshould look to compete\nglobally.\u201d The society\nis currently working on\nplans to compete with\nAmerican universities in\nthe near future.\nThe debate about\nwhether eSports should\nbe counted as \u2018real\u2019\nsports is ongoing; those\nwho defend eSports\nwould point out the quick\nreaction times and agile\nminds needed by those\nwho ascend to the top of\nthe leagues, arguing that\nsuch skills are similar to\nthose required in a number\nof professional sports. But\nthe safest argument may\nbe in audience numbers:\nthe 2014 League of\nLegends championship,\nfor example, saw 40,000\nfans pack into the same\narena South Korea used\nfor the 2002 World Cup\nsemi final; in the States,\nthe first eSports arena has\nbeen launched in Santa\nAna, California, while\nlater this year the first\neSports Arena on the Las\nVegas strip is set to open\nits doors. Viewership of\nthe tournaments has also\nexploded, thanks to platforms like Twitch, which\nwas bought by Amazon\nin 2014 for $1 billion.\nIn 2013, the League of\nLegends world championship had 32 million\npeople across the globe\nwatching; last year\u2019s NBA\nfinals had an audience of\nonly 20 million.\nIt seems likely that,\nshould the growth currently enjoyed by the\neSports industry continue,\nit may leapfrog a number\nof other traditional sports.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that\neSports are achieving a\nnumber of participants\nand viewers it took traditional sports decades or\ncenturies to achieve,\u201d Roy\ntells me, \u201cI am certain\nthat eSports will be part\nof university culture very\nsoon.\u201d eSports are also\nchallenging traditional\nassumptions about what\ngaming and gamers look\nlike: \u201cgamers still find\nthemselves defending\ntheir passion for eSports,\u201d\nRoy tells me, \u201cthey are\nimmediately associated\nwith the stereotype of\nanti-social nerds in their\nparents\u2019 basement.\u201d\nThe atmosphere at the\ntournaments show that\nthis couldn\u2019t be further\nfrom the truth: thousands\nof people go along to\ncheer their favourite teams\nalong, coming together\nfor a brief moment in\ncelebration of teamwork\nand strategy. \u201ceSports\nbring people together,\u201d\nargues Liam, \u201cthey participate in something bigger,\nexperiencing it as a group,\nin much the same way\nother sports and hobbies\ndo. eSports give people\nan avenue to do what\nthey love whilst sharing\nthat with other people.\u201d\nLooking at videos of these\ntournaments, and you\u2019d be\nhard pressed to disagree:\nwhile the players are\nlocked in a battle of wills\nwith their screens, their\nfaces masks of steely de-termination, around them\nthere\u2019s a legion of fans,\nwho have come together,\nand are eagerly looking\non.\nImperial College\nUnion\u2019s eSports Society\nwill be hosting their\nVarsity against UCL on\nSaturday 27th\nJanuary,\nfrom 10am, in the Union\nConcert Hall.

While\na number of critics still\nquestion whether video\ngames are true works\nof art, their popularity\nis manifestly evident in\nthe economic figures:\nlast year, the video game\nindustry made $109\nbillion in revenue. To put\nthat number into context,\nthe global box office\nfor films last year was a\nmere $41.2 billion, while\nworldwide art sales came\nin at $45 billion\nAnd this is a market\nthat shows no sign of\nslowing down: last year\nthe industry grew 7.8%,\nand is expected to expand\nmassively on smartphone\nplatforms. eSports has\nthe potential to increase\nthis growth even further,\nas tournaments with\neye-wateringly high prize\npools proliferate.

Whilst mental\nhealth issues or light\nexposure from our phones\nmay impact how fast\nwe can fall asleep, one\ncommon cause of poor\nsleep is the worry posed\nby upcoming tasks in the\nfuture.\nThese unfinished tasks\nare shown to have a high\nlevel of cognitive activa-tion, such that thoughts\ncan pop up automatically\nat various times during the\nday.\nTo combat this phe-nomenon, it was shown\nthat bedtime writing may\nhelp you to fall asleep\nfaster. In cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for\ninsomnia, therapists will\noften ask patients to write\na \u2018worry list\u2019 to unburden\nanxieties. However, it\nwas unclear what exactly\nyou should write about in\norder to help you sleep.\nTo answer that\nquestion, scientists from\nBaylor University in\nTexas recruited 57 healthy\nvolunteers for a one-week\nsleep study. Half of the\ngroup were asked to write\ndown a list of tasks they\nhad completed in the past\nfew days, while the other\nhalf were asked to scribe\na to-do list for errands that\nthey have to run in the\nnext few days.\nBoth writing activities\nrequired five minutes\nbefore bed, and the time\nneeded to fall asleep was\nmeasured using overnight\npolysomnography \u2013 a\nmachine that measures\nbrain activity.\nSurprisingly, though\nmany would suspect\nwriting a to-do list prior\nto sleeping would cause\nmore worry, as you would\nbe reminded of all the\nthings you need to do\nin the coming week, the\nreverse is true! Participants who wrote down a\nto-do list fell asleep faster\n\u201cUnfinished\ntasks are\nshown to have\na high level\nof cognitive\nactivation,\nsuch that\nthoughts\npop up\nautomatically\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s time\nfor a big pull-quote. We love\nthese things,\nbut don\u2019t\nforget to make\nthem short!\u201d\nthan those who made a\n\u2018have-done\u2019 list.\nThe explanation behind\nthis effect is still debata-ble. The most compelling\nhypothesis suggests this\nactivity allows you to\noffload worries, therefore\nreducing the amount\nof time needed to fall\nasleep. Completed tasks\nin the past are not worri-some, hence do not need\n\u2018off-loading\u2019, so writing a\nlist has no impact.\nThe quantity of writing\nis also important, as volunteers who completed a\nlonger to-do list fell asleep\nfaster than those who had\na shorter to-do list. Contrarily, people who wrote\na detailed account of their\npast activities needed\nmore time to fall asleep.\nThis can be explained\nby various reasons.\nOne explanation is that\nbusier people may have\na longer completed-task\nlist, and may find it more\ndifficult to sleep as they\nhave higher stress level.\nA second explanation\nsuggests that thinking of\npast events can lead to the\nactivation of thought processes for future events.\nFor instance, if you think\nof the PowerPoint you\nmade yesterday, it may\nprompt you to think about\nthe presentation for next\nweek, therefore triggering\nmore worries.\nThough this potentially\nopens a new door to a free\nand easily administered\nsleep, larger studies\nare needed to conclude\nwhether this could help\npeople with insomnia\nor mental health issues.\nNevertheless, next time\nyou are unable to fall\nasleep, rather than writing\nyour diary, get a pen and\nstart writing a to-do list\ninstead!\nDOI: 10.1037/\nxge0000374\nNominate staff members in the following categories:\nBestTutoring\nBestTeaching for Undergraduates\nBest GraduateTeaching Assistant\nBest Feedback\nNominations close 11 February 2018.

    "content": "POLITICS\nFRIDAY, 19TH\nJANUARY, 2018 FELIX\n8\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nInnovation will save us from an economic\ndeath\nWe can return to long-term economic prosperity if we take a few lessons from the laws of\nthermodynamics.\nPOLITICS\nTom Hall\nPolitics Writer\nT\nhe global economy is stalling\nbecause of a lack\nof innovation.\nBeyond computers, there\nis no longer a revolutionary mentality towards\ntechnology. You can see\nit in our psychology: we\ncall ourselves the developed world, as if all great\nstrides have already been\nmade. Granted we depict\nour visions of the future\nin Hollywood movies, but\n\u2013 beyond improved CGI\n\u2013 these visions largely\nhaven\u2019t changed.\nIf you look beyond\nthe Internet and beyond\nsuperficial design, we\nhave done little more than\nincrementally improve\nin recent decades. Aeroplanes are still largely\nrecognisable from their\n1960s blueprints, and\nwhile energy has flirted\nwith both nuclear and\nrenewables it remains\ndominated by fossil fuels.\nThis is because well-es-tablished sectors are typically concentrated with a\nfew large companies.\nThese behemoths,\ndespite what their recruitment marketing may tell\nyou, prefer incremental\nimprovements rather than\nindustry-destabilising\ninnovations. These companies are risk-averse\n\u2013 they have shareholders\nto please and investing\nin innovation carries risk,\nparticularly in abstract\nand uncertain areas.\nEconomics borrows its\nmathematical foundations\nfrom thermodynamics and\nso a simple thermodynamic analogy should serve to\nillustrate how this lack of\ninnovation is leading to\nstaleness:\nwhereas cold companies\nare lagging. Heat transfer\noccurs as the colder\ncompany imitates away\nall the hotter company\u2019s\ntechnological breakthroughs until we reach\nequilibrium.\nThe end state in thermodynamics is called the\nheat death of the universe,\nwhen the whole universe\nis at the same temperature\nand there is no free energy\nto be exploited. Similarly,\nunder this analogy, an\neconomic heat death\nwould be a state of perfect\ncompetition, a market\nmade up of undifferentiated companies with\nundifferentiated products\ncompeting on price.\nProfits in a perfectly\ncompetitive market are\nminimal: airlines on\naverage made a profit\nof $0.37 per $178 ticket\nin 2012. With such low\nprofits, there is little\nmoney to reinvest into\nthe company. Funding\ngets cut for research and\ndevelopment projects,\nwhile improvements to\nservices and facilities\nstart getting cut too. To\nmake higher profits and\navoid economic sterility,\nyou must dominate an\nindustry.\nThere are two ways\nto dominate a market\nthrough innovation. The\nfirst is a Google: produce\na product magnitudes\nbetter than your rivals\nas Google did with their\nsearch engine. The second\nis an Amazon: create an\nentirely new market, as\nAmazon did with online\nretail. What both have in\ncommon is disruption;\nwhile not essential, it is\nperhaps a reason why\ninnovation has been\nlimited to internet-based\nstart-ups. Once on top\nthough and in a dominant\nposition, it becomes even\nmore important to keep\non innovating, otherwise\nall your advances will be\nimitated away.\nIndustries such as\nmanagement consulting\nand investment banking\noffer great value in well-oiled economies but they\nrely on technological\nbreakthroughs for their\nsurvival. In the absence\nof advances, they are\nmerely catalysts to this\nstate of equilibrium, this\neconomic heat death.\nConsultancies often work\nto restructure a company,\nstreamlining it to reduce\ncosts, make savings, and\nunlock profits. There is\nhowever a finite limit to\nthis process and gains\neconomic struggle to\nfocus on short-term\nlivelihoods by securing\npositions in these or other\nlong-established indus-tries, it does not guarantee\nlong-term prosperity. For\nthat we need innovators,\ncreators and entrepre-neurs, people with a revolutionary mentality, those\nthat see the future as being\ncreated, not imagined.\nThis is certainly a riskier\npathway as you must\nforge it on your own \u2013\nrecreating what someone\nelse has already done will\nearn you nothing. With\nrisk, however, comes\nreward and those that are\nsuccessful are often more\nhandsomely rewarded for\ntheir boldness.\nToday\u2019s face of innovation is arguably Elon\nMusk: his companies\ninclude Tesla, SpaceX,\nSolarCity, The Boring\nCompany, Neuralink,\nHyperloop, and more.\nThough his cult following may present him as\ndivinely blessed, the\nsuccess of these companies is instead enabled by\nthousands of innovators.\nIf there is something to be\nlearnt from Elon Musk, it\nis that his vast number of\nprojects are evidence that\nopportunities to innovate\nstill exist.\nIf we are to reinject\ndynamism into our\neconomy, then we need\nto be bold and start taking\nrisks in our career choices.\nAt Imperial we have great\nscientific foundations and\nexposure to cutting-edge\ntechnology, putting us in\nprime position to be the\ninnovators and the entrepreneurs of the future. So,\nlet\u2019s be bold and let\u2019s be\nambitious!\nThe economy needs to be driven by innovators // Creative Commons\n\u201cFor long-term\nprosperity\nwe need\ninnovators,\ncreators, and\nentrepeneurs\n\u2013 people with a\nrevolutionary\nmentality\u201d\nbecome increasingly\nmarginal without technological innovation.\nInvestment bankers\nmake money off bets, predicting when a company\nis under- or over-valued.\nIn this eventual state of\nperfect competition, all\ncompanies are undifferentiated and correctly\nvalued, meaning there\nis no more money to be\nmade. To start unlocking\nmoney again, there needs\nto be technological breakthroughs that destabilise\nan industry.\nThough it may be\ntempting in times of\n\u201cBeyond\ncomputers,\nthere is no\nlonger a\nrevolutionary\nmentality\ntowards\ntechnology\u201d\nIn thermodynamics,\nwhere you have temperature differences, heat\nwill flow from the hotter\nobject to the colder object\nuntil they reach equilib-rium. To apply this to\neconomics, we can simply\nrefer to technology differ-ences; hot companies are\ntechnologically-advanced\n\n"

Over the course of\ntwo previous features, and\nnumerous stage works,\nMcDonagh has set himself\napart as one of the most\nunique directors working\ntoday. Unfortunately,\nThree Billboards also\nhighlights his weaknesses,\ndisplaying an anathema\nfor well-rounded charac-terisation, an inability to\nachieve tonal balance, and\na complete avoidance of\nnuance.\nSet in the small town\nof Ebbing \u2013 a non-specific\nlocation that serves as a\nstand-in for any number\nof generic \u2018Midwestern\u2019\nlocales \u2013 Three Billboards\nis set seven months after\nthe vicious rape and\nmurder of teenagerAngela\nHayes. It is a crime that\nremains unsolved, leading\nAngela\u2019s mother, Mildred\n(Frances McDormand), to\npurchase three billboards\nalong the road where her\ndaughter was killed, reminding the townspeople\nthat justice has not been\nserved. \u201cIt seems like the\nlocal police department\nis too busy goin\u2019 round\ntorturing black folks to be\nbothered doing anything\nabout solving actual\ncrime\u201d, as Mildred put\nit, referring to the racial\ntensions that lie at the\nheart of the film.\nThis decision of McDonagh\u2019s \u2013 to wrap his\nsnappy language around\nthe incredibly emotive\nissue of police brutality\n\u2013 is the film\u2019s ultimate\ndownfall. He thrusts\nissues of race into the\nnarrative with a complete\nlack of nuance or tact,\nembodying them in the\ncharacter of Office Dixon\n(Sam Rockwell); while\nhe might not be the only\nracist member of Ebbing\u2019s\npolice department, he is\nthe most racist, bearing\nresponsibility for the\naforementioned torturing of people of color.\nThroughout the film he\ncontinually intimidates\nthe few minority characters present, and uses\ndisproportionate levels of\nforce without any serious\nrepercussions.\nHis \u2018lovable hick\u2019 character is, supposedly, countered by Bill Willoughby\n(Woody Harrelson), the\ntown\u2019s sheriff. Claiming\nto be committed to justice\nfor Angela in spirit, if not\nquite in practice, he still\ncontinues to happily have\nracist thugs in his team\nand needs to be spurred\ninto action by Mildred.\nMcDonagh counters the\nimplications of Willoughby\u2019s inactions by playing\na sympathy card that is\noffensively obvious to\nthe audience, and giving\nhim terminal cancer. If\nthis is supposed to remind\nus that morality is not a\nblack and white affair, as\nMcDonagh has exhorted\nin numerous interviews,\nit is done without nuance,\nand with a completely\nstraight face.\nWhile it may not\ndirectly mine a Trumpian\nseam of perceived injustice against the police,\nmake no mistake: Three\nBillboards is, at its heart,\na Blue Lives Matter film,\ntelling us we should\nforgive racist cops who\nfeel free to torture or kill\nblack folks, provided they\nneatly learn their lessons\nwithin a 115-minute\nruntime. Topics as urgent\nand emotionally-resonant\nas modern-day racism\nand sexual violence are\nhandled in a completely\ntone-deaf manner \u2013 all\nthe more inexcusable\nnow the cultural dialogue\nsurrounding them has\nbecome a roar.\nMcDonagh has made\na choice to set himself\nagainst a standard it is\ndifficult for any filmmaker to measure up to; but\nwhen he makes the choice\nto not include any black\ncharacters in the main\ncast, it implies McDonagh\nsees the political context\nas little more than fodder\nfor the film\u2019s necessary\nredemptive arc. The\nclosest we come to a ful-ly-realised black character\n\u2013 in a film where race is\na central focus \u2013 is one of\nAngela\u2019s coworkers, who\nis arrested for possession\nof weed. A crime for\nwhich African-Americans\nare arrested at four times\nthe rate as Caucasians, is a\nmere narrative device.\nThe other major failure\nis a confusion about\nwhat kind of film Three\nBillboards is supposed to\nbe, lurching from black\ncomedy to serious drama\nwithin the space of a\ncouple of lines. It\u2019s a juxtaposition that lessens the\nimpact of the truly great\nmoments within the piece\n\u2013 and make no mistake,\nthere are some really\nbrilliant scenes within\nthe film. By the credits\nroll, this ricocheting back\nand forth \u2013 with detours\ninto sickly sentimentality\nand teen angst \u2013 leaves\none feeling rather queasy,\nhaving seen two half-de-cent films rather than a\ncomplete work.\nThree Billboards is at\nits best when it serves as\na platform for McDormand\u2019s acting chops. Her\nMildred is by turns fierce\nand maternal, and McDormand manages to convey\na bitter world-weariness\nthat has imprinted itself\nupon Mildred\u2019s entire\nbeing. A current frontrunner to collect the Best\nActress Oscar in March, it\nwould be a well-deserved\nwin, since she carries\nmuch of the film. There\nare strong supporting\nturns from the rest of the\ncast, who \u2013 with a few\nexceptions \u2013 uniformly\ndeliver: Lucas Hedges\nis affecting as Mildred\u2019s\nson, who just wants to\nmove on without being\nconstantly reminded of\nhis sister\u2019s murder, and\nHarrelson is convincing,\neven if his lines are not.\nEven Peter Dinklage plays\nhis part well, although\nhis character\u2019s inclusion\nseems to just be an excuse\nfor McDonagh to use the\nword \u2018midget\u2019 throughout\nthe script.\nUltimately, despite the\nbest efforts of the cast,\nthe film\u2019s screenplay is\nwhat lets it down. While\nMcDonagh managed to do\nwell with In Bruges, his\nBelgian-set caper, Three\nBillboards has him biting\noff far more than he can\nchew. It\u2019s cinema where\nthe harrowing nature of\npolice brutality can be\nused as a mere backdrop;\nwhere emotional tone\nfluctuates so wildly as\nto leave you nauseated;\nwhere expletives serve as\na stand-in for well-written\nlines. It\u2019s not as clever as it\nthinks it is, and absolutely\nnowhere near as clever as\nit needs to be.\n\u201cFive months\u201d\u2026\u201dand still no SCR Breakfasts\u201d\u2026\u201dHow come, Imperial?\u201d // Fox Searchlight\nFILM\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nDir: Martin McDonagh.\nScript: Martin McDonagh.\nStarring: Frances\nMcDormand, Woody\nHarrelson, Sam Rockwell,\nJohn Hawkes, Peter\nDinklage. 115 minutes\nTHREE BILLBOARDS\nOUTSIDE EBBING,\nMISSOURI\nIs time up for Woody Allen?\nAt one point, it seemed that #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up would pass director Woody Allen by, but things are starting to\nchange, as more actors disavow their relationships with him.\nFILM\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nL\nittle over three\nmonths have\npassed since allegations of sexual\nmisconduct against movie\nindustry czar Harvey\nWeinstein emerged, and\nsince then the flood of reports of Hollywood abuse\nshows no sign of abating.\nNot only have more victims of Weinstein come\nout of the shadows \u2013 more\nthan 80 as things currently\nstand \u2013 but others have\nalso faced accusations of\nheinous misconduct, from\nKevin Spacey to Jeffrey\nTambor. Some, like Louis\nC.K., have confirmed the\naccusations, and offered\nto make amends; others\nstaunchly proclaim their\ninnocence. Barely a week\ngoes by without new\ncrimes coming to light\n\u2013 if your favourite actor\nis trending on Twitter,\nthere\u2019s a fair chance it\ncould be because allegations have emerged.\n\u201cOne figure\nwho had thus\nfar seemed\nimmune to\nthe #MeToo\nmovement was\nWoody Allen\u201d\n\u201cThe #MeToo\nmovement has\nnow drawn a\nclear line in\nthe sand for\nHollywood\u201d\n\u2018The Silence Breakers\u2019\nwere even chosen as TIME\nmagazine\u2019s \u2018Person of\nthe Year\u2019, in recognition\nof the profound cultural\nshift. One figure who has\nthus far seemed immune\nto the #MeToo movement,\nhowever, is director\nWoody Allen. This might\nbe about to change.\nAllen\u2019s career has long\nhad a sense of unease\nattached, dating back\n25 years, to 1992, when\nDylan Farrow \u2013 the\nadoptive daughter of\nhis then-partner Mia\nFarrow \u2013 accused him of\nsexually assaulting her.\nShe was seven at the time.\nFarrow\u2019s allegations were\ninvestigated by leading\ndoctors at the Yale-New\nHaven Hospital\u2019s Child\nSexual Abuse Clinic,\nwho concluded that they\nwere fabricated, but their\nreport has been criticised\nby some. While the state\nattorney said that there\nwas \u201cprobable cause\u201d\nto pursue Allen legally,\nthe case was eventually\ndropped. Since then,\nwhenever the topic of\nconversation turns to\nAllen, it isn\u2019t long before\nsomeone brings up the\ncase; \u201cand have you seen\nhis films?\u201d they\u2019ll say,\n\u201cit\u2019s no surprise\u201d.\nIt is true that Allen does\nhimself no favours with\nhis filmography. Even as\nsomeone who loves much\nof his work, it\u2019s easy to\nsee some of the problems\nin the films, which typically revolve around a\nwide age-gap between the\nmain romantic couples\nin his films. Throughout\nhis films, he continually\nreturns to the trope of a\nyoung ingenue, taken in\nby an older, more experienced man. The gap has\nbeen known to push close\nto 40 years in some films,\nand in Manhattan, his best\nwork, Allen\u2019s character is\nin a relationship with a\nhigh school student, 26\nyears younger than him.\nBut while all of it add\nup to a pretty grim picture,\nmany actors have been\nhappy to continue working\nwith Allen. At one point,\nit might have seemed that\nthe #MeToo revolution\nwas going to pass him\nby; indeed, in December\nDylan wrote an op-ed\nin the LA Times, asking\nwhy actors like Kate\nWinslet and Blake Lively\nwere quick to criticise\nWeinstein and speak out\nin favour of the change in\nmood, but also defended\ntheir work with Allen.\nWinslet, for example, said\n\u201cas the actor\u2026you just\nhave to step away and say,\nI don\u2019t know anything,\nreally\u2026Woody Allen is\nan incredible director.\u201d\nThings have since\nshifted. One by one,\nactors who had previously\nworked withAllen, or who\nhave projects with him,\nare stating their regret.\nEllen Page called working\nwith Allen \u201cthe biggest\nregret of my career\u201d,\nwhile Mira Sorvino, who\nwon an Academy Award\nfor her role in Allen\u2019s\nMighty Aphrodite, wrote\nan open letter apologising\nto Dylan for having her\nwatch \u201csomeone you\ncalled out as having hurt\nyou\u2026be lauded again and\nagain.\u201d\nGreta Gerwig, who\nworked with Allen in\nTo Rome With Love, has\nsaid \u201cif I had known\nthen what I know now, I\nwould not have acted in\nthe film.\u201d The director,\nactor, and screenwriter\nwent on to say that she\nwould never work with\nhim again. Rebecca Hall\nand Timothee Chalamet,\nmeanwhile, who both\nappear in Allen\u2019s latest\nwork A Rainy Day in New\nYork, are both donating\ntheir salaries to charities,\nincluding Time\u2019s Up, and\nHall has said she will not\nwork with him again.\nThis information\nabout Allen has been\ncommon knowledge for\nmany years, so what has\nchanged? As the talk\naround sexual misconduct\nin Hollywood has reached\na crescendo, it is harder\nand harder for actors to\nplead ignorance about\nwho they\u2019re working\nwith; this is especially\ntrue in a case like Allen\u2019s,\nwhere his alleged victims\nhave written, in painstaking detail, about the\nimpact his actions have\nhad on their lives. There is\nalso another sea change:\nmore and more people\nare waking up to the true\nnature of sexual miscon-duct, which is centred\naround power, and is just\none product of the culture\nin which we live. We can\u2019t\nblame the individual; we\nneed to look at how we all\ncontribute to the problem,\nand this extends to the\nactors.\nDoes this mark the end\nof Allen\u2019s career? It\u2019s difficult to say at this stage,\nbut it is certain that the\n#MeToo movement has\ndrawn a line in the sand\nfor many in Hollywood \u2013\nwhether or not he goes on\nmaking films, things will\nnever be the same.\nGreta Gerwig has said she will not work with Allen again, while Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is donating his salary // CC\nAmid this awful\ndeluge, however, something good has emerged:\nwomen, within both the\nfilm industry and society\nin general, are standing\nup, using hashtags like\n#MeToo or creating organisations like Time\u2019s Up.\n\n"

What better\nway of challenging one\u2019s\nown beliefs? Unfortunately, we got as far\nthe second paragraph\nbefore we began to find\nmisrepresentations of\nwell-known statistics\nalongside unsubstantiated\narguments and sweeping\ngeneralisations throughout the article.\nBecause the authors\nwill not hear from us\nwhat Zionism is, then\nlet\u2019s take a closer look\nat Theodor Herzl\u2019s\nproposals for a Jewish\nhomeland \u2013 the very same\nman that coined the idea\nof Zionism. Herzl himself\nstated that antisemitism\ncould not be defeated or\ncured, only avoided, and\nthat the only way to avoid\nit was the establishment\nof a Jewish state. These\nclaims were made by\nhim after witnessing the\nblatant anti-Semitism that\nwas present at the Dreyfus\ncase in Paris. Beginning\nin late 1895, Herzl wrote\nDer Judenstaat (The\nState of the Jews). The\nbook argued that the\nJewish people should\nleave Europe either for\nArgentina or, preferably,\nfor Palestine, their historic\nhomeland, if they wished\nto. Herzl then negotiated\nwith the British regarding the possibility of\nsettling the Jews on the\nisland of Cyprus, the El\nArish region in the Sinai\nPeninsula in Egypt, and\nUganda. So, quite clearly,\nthe establishment of a\nJewish homeland in Palestine specifically was not\nhis utmost priority, since,\nalthough he mentions\nArgentina or Palestine\nas choices, he generally\nrefers to the location of\nThe land of Palestine\nwas one of his choices\ndue to historic ties with\nthe Jewish religion; but\nthis is not something\nsurprising, since all three\nAbrahamic religions have\nhistoric ties with the land\nof Palestine \u2013 it\u2019s the place\nwhere Jesus Christ was\nborn, died, and buried,\nand where the Prophet\nMohammed is said to\nhave travelled to from\nMecca, and then ascended\nto heaven from the Al\nAqsa Mosque (located in\nJerusalem). Palestine and\nJerusalem are holy sites\nof the three Abrahamic\nreligions, hence none of\nthem should have a larger\nclaim over this land than\nthe other two. This is\nsomething acknowledged\nby Herzl himself, as well\nas Arthur Balfour when\nhe signed the declaration.\nSo we return back to the\nsame question posed in\nthe initial article: Why is\nit then, that Palestinians\nhave suffered ethnic\ncleansing, and exist as\nsecond class citizens in\nthe state in Israel?\nWhat the authors of\nthe response to our article\n(including those who\nare underage), torture\ntactics are being carried\nout during interrogations,\nthere\u2019s a ridiculously long\nlist of discriminatory laws\nexisting against Arab\ncitizens in Israel, the\nseparation wall is twice as\ntall and four times longer\nthan the former Berlin\nWall, and yes, ethnic\ncleansing did happen, it\u2019s\ncalled Al Nakba \u2013 in 1948\n750,000 Palestinians were\nforcibly displaced from\ntheir homes, with another\n300,000 refugees being\ndisplaced after 1967; as\nof 2015, for the UN Relief\nand Works Agenecy\nfor Palestine Refugees\n(UNRWA) mandate there\nare 5 million Palestinian\nrefugees.\nSo no, these are not\n\u201csweeping generalisations\u201d or \u201cbuzzwords\u201d\nthese are facts, that the\nwriters purposely chose\nto ignore because it suited\ntheir political agenda.\nEvery single listed violation of human rights\nabove has been well-doc-umented, so if you will\nnot take it from us, the\noppressed, maybe sources\nlike Humans Right\nWatch, UNRWA, Unicef,\nHaaretz, and Wikipedia\nwill be valid enough.\nAnd since the authors\ncited people that have\nexperienced the South\nAfrican Apartheid, maybe\nthey will find Nelson\nMandela\u2019s view on the\nconflict relevant: \u201cwe\nknow too well that our\nfreedom is incomplete\nwithout the freedom of the\nPalestinians.\u201d\nEd: An online version\nof the article, with links\nto references, is available\nfrom felixonline.co.uk\nJerusalem is the centre of a long-running political argument // Pixabay\n\u201cThere are\ncountless cases\nof random\nsearches and\ndetentions\nbeing carried\nout in the late\nhours of the\nnight\u201d\nhave answered is a pure\nblatant denial of these\nfacts, ignoring the stories\nof displaced families\nliving in refugee camps,\nor children in Gaza with\nno access to clean water\nor electricity because the\nsupply is being cut by\nIsrael when they please.\nThere are countless cases\nof young Palestinian boys\nand girls being attacked\nby illegal Israeli settlers,\ncheckpoints that only\nPalestinians have to go\nthrough in order to carry\nout daily activities such\nas going to work, and\nrandom searches and detentions carried out at late\nhours of the night.\nPalestinians are being\nheld in prison without\ntrials or accusations\n\u201cPalestine and\nJerusalem are\nholy sites of\nthree religions,\nhence none\nshould have\na larger claim\nover the\nothers\u201d\nthe state as \u201cover there\u201d in\nhis book, and considered\nfour other possible areas.\n\n"

Their famed avatars\n(2D, Murdoc, Russel,\nand Noodle) started\nappearing in the media,\nand updates on their lives\nwere slowly unveiled,\nbridging the gap between\nphase 3 and the incoming\nphase 4. Everyone was\ngetting ready for the big\ncomeback. However,\n2016 soon came to an\nend leaving the impatient\nfans with no new music\nfrom the world\u2019s favourite\nvirtual band. It was exactly\none year ago \u2013 January\n19th, the day before\nDonald Trump\u2019s inauguration - when we finally\nheard the first Gorillaz\nsong since 2012, \u2018Hallelujah Money\u2019, featuring\none of the most promising\nand original new artists\naround \u2013 Benjamin Clementine. Murdoc and his\ncrew started creeping into\nthe collective conscious-ness, using all possible\nplatforms of expression.\nFrom posts on social\nmedia, interviews, Spotify\nplaylists through videos\nand smartphone app to\nmurals, posters and secret\ngigs. They had everything\ncovered.\nAs always, the team\nbehind Gorillaz pushed\ntechnological limits to\nbring their ideas to life.\nThis time around, apart\nfrom cool animations and\neven a 360\u00b0 video, they\nalso created a portable,\neco-friendly recording\nstudio and produced\nan augmented reality\napp The Lenz which\nshowed Gorillaz-related\ncontent whenever you\npointed your smartphone\ncamera at something\nmagenta. What\u2019s more,\n2D and Murdoc even\ngave their first ever real\ntime animated interview,\nblurring the boundaries\nreality and fiction. In the\nworld where avatars are\ngiven so much importance\nand cartoon characters\nare not only present\nin the show business,\nbut become influential\n\u201cThey\u2019re a\nbrand, an\nindustry, a\none of a kind\npopcultural\nphenomenon.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve heard\nslogans\nabout coming\ntogether and\nsharing one\nlove a million\ntimes by now,\nbut when\nGorillaz say\nit, I actually\nbelieve them\u201d\npoliticians \u2013 Noodle, 2D,\nMurdoc and Russel seem\nmore real and relevant\nthan ever before.\nGorillaz have always\nbeen more than just\nmusic \u2013 they\u2019re a brand,\nan industry, a one of a\nkind popcultural phe-nomenon. But let\u2019s talk\nabout the album itself.\nOn the 28 April 2017, the\nwait was finally over and\nHUMANZ dropped. While\nsome fans immediately\nloved it, others were a bit\ndisappointed (see Felix\nissue 1678). I would not\ncall it a masterpiece; there\nwere a couple of songs\nthat didn\u2019t quite match\nthe standard of hits like\n\u2018Clint Eastwood\u2019or \u2018Dirty\nHarry\u2019.Nonetheless,\nthere were many great\ntracks (e.g. \u2018Strobelite\u2019 or\n\u2018Charger\u2019) and the album\noverall was received well.\nAccusations of having too\nmany guests on the record\nand not enough Damon\nmade by some fans are\nrather pointless. Gorillaz\nhas always been a collaborative effort and the musicians involved changed\nover the years. Collaboration lies at the heart of\nHUMANZ. The title says\nit all \u2013 HUMANZ is about\nthe humanity crisis we\u2019re\ngoing through. And it\u2019s\nnot just represented in the\nlyrics; the album carries\nthe message non-verbally.\nJuxtaposition of individual human voices and rich,\nwarm sounds of gospel\nchoirs, with machine generated music resulting in\na good quality, cohesive\nalbum is itself a metaphor\nof a human race that can\nfind its place in the artificial world and work as\none.\nDespite dealing with\ntough issues, HUMANZ\nends with a positive\nmessage.You may say that\nfinishing the record with\nwords \u201cWe got the power\nto be loving each other no\nmatter what happens\u201d is\nrather infantile. I agree.\nWe\u2019ve heard slogans\nabout coming together\nand sharing one love a\nmillion times by now.\nBut when Gorillaz say it,\nI actually believe them,\nbecause they support their\nstatements with action.\nIt is the most apparent in\ntheir live performances.\nSeeing this diverse group\nof people coming from\nvarious musical back-grounds, young and old,\nblack and white, famous\nand unknown, rappers\nand singers putting on a\nfantastic show at the O2\nArena on 5th December\n2017 was truly uplifting.\nThe gig was wonder-ful. The band, smiling\nat each other, dancing,\nspontaneously hugging\nand simply having lots of\nfun on stage, proved that\nthe coexistence is possible\nand even enjoyable! The\nlong setlist included old\nhits (\u2018Feel Good Inc.\u2019),\nnew bangers (\u2018Andromeda\u2019), great renditions of\nslightly forgotten tracks\n(\u2018Every planet we reach\nis dead\u2019) and homages to\niconic artists who are no\nlonger with us (\u2018Stylo\u2019).\nWith two drumkits, all\nsorts of electronics and a\nmultitude of other musicians on stage, the sounds\nwere extremely powerful\nand kept the crowd going\nfor over two hours.\nThe show culminated with the beautiful\n\u2018Demon Days\u2019 from their\n2007 classic, leaving\nthe audience with a big\nred sphere on the screen\nand the choir repeatedly\nchanting \u201cTo the Sun!\u201d.\nThe song is still relevant\nafter a decade. It gives\nhope and acknowledges\nthat to cope with hard\ntimes, it is important (but\ndifficult) to stay optimis-tic: \u201cIn these demon days\nit\u2019s so cold inside / So hard\nfor a good soul to survive/\n(\u2026) Pick yourself up\nit\u2019s a brand new day /\nso turn yourself round /\nDon\u2019t burn yourself, turn\nyourself / Turn yourself\naround into the Sun\u201d.\nWith that in mind we\ncan enter 2018 hoping\nfor some good changes in\nour lives and in the world\naround us. But above all\nwaiting for the rumoured\nnext Gorillaz album!\nIt\u2019s the moments we relive, it\u2019s the moments like this // Sabina Nowakowska\n\n"

Last\nyear saw a minibus-load\nmake the trek up North\nto Newcastle; this time it\nwas decided to head down\nSouth.\nThe destination was\nset for Dorchester, the\nhistoric county town of\nDorset and home to the\nclub\u2019s notorious secretary \u2013 writer of numerous\nFelix articles detailing the\nclub\u2019s exploits (including\nthis one).\nThe journey should\nhave been a breeze\nrelative to 2017\u2019s winter\ntrip to Tyneside, with\nan ETA of 21:00 after a\nrelaxed leaving time of\n18:00. However, nothing\nis ever that simple.\nWith the crew all\naboard one of the Union\u2019s\nrelatively new, majestic\nPeugeot Boxers, our\ndiligent drivers were completing their final safety\nchecks when they realised\nthat both brake lights were\nnot working, and we could\nnot get authorisation for\nanother bus as the relevant\nauthorities had gone home\nfor the weekend.\nThis set in motion a\nseries of (failed) attempts\nto remedy the problem\nbefore the drivers eventually resorted to calling the\nRAC (other breakdown\ncompanies are available),\nwho fixed the problem in\na matter of minutes after\na two-hour wait. All this\nmeant a departure time\nof 22:30 and the resulting\nclear roads meant the\nbrakes were hardly needed\nfor the two-hour journey\ndown to the South Coast.\nThe problematic start\nto the tour did not dampen\nspirits, however, and\nthe runners arose from\ntheir makeshift beds in\n\u2018the orangery\u2019 early on\nSaturday morning for\nthe short drive to the\n\u201cThe crowd\nwere\nimpressed by\nthe standard\nand number of\nred and navy\nvests\u201d\nnearby five km parkrun\nin the seaside resort of\nWeymouth (known to\nlocal alcohol-fuelled\nteenagers as Wey-biza).\nThe team posted a strong\nperformance and the usual\ncrowd were impressed by\nthe standard and number\nof red and navy vests\ntearing along the gravel,\nmud, and tarmacked\npaths.\nrather chilly (freezing)\nwaters for a \u201crefreshing\u201d\ndip.\nSensibly heading\nbriskly back to the\nwarmth of the minibus\nto avoid hypothermia,\nthe squad headed back\nto base and proceeded to\nhave a mighty brunch and\nyoga session (albeit not\nsimultaneously), before\nsettling down to watch\none of the club\u2019s stars race\non BBC One! Imperial\u2019s\nChris Olley managed to\nbattle home in 15th\nplace\nin the Senior Men\u2019s International Challenge XC\nin Edinburgh beating last\nyear\u2019s BUCS XC winner\non the line.\nFeeling newly inspired,\nthe runners donned their\nrunning shoes once more\n\u2013 this time for a spot of\n\u201cDorchesTourism\u201d or\nto \u201cExplorchester\u201d (you\ncan decide which Strava\ntitle is best). Some of the\nwondrous sights visited\non the gentle jog around\nthe town of 19,000\nincluded a number of\nRoman artefacts including\nan amphitheatre, an excavated town house, and a\ntrip down some famously\nstraight Roman roads. A\nHardy few then travelled\nFar from the Madding\nCrowd to see the house\nof 20th\ncentury author\nThomas Hardy (author of\nTess of the D\u2019Urbervilles\nand other works).\nThe team returned to\nthe house exhausted, but\nthere was little time for\nrest: some tasty fajitas\nwere rustled up for dinner,\nenergetic post-meal games\nwere played, and then it\nwas time to hit the town.\nDorchester \u2013 not known\nfor its nightlife \u2013 provided\nthe weary students with\nreasonably priced alcohol\nand much merriment, as\nwell as a DJ who seemed\nwilling to take literally\nany requests and play\nthem no questions asked.\nAll this, combined with\na dancefloor containing a\nwide range of odd locals,\nled to much amusement\nand fun was had by all.\nOn the way home, the\nteam stopped off at the\noverpriced, monopolistic\nkebab shop to refuel after a\nbusy day and settled down\nfor a short sleep before the\ntraditional Sunday long\nrun the following day.\nAfter the keenest\nathletes completed a quick\ncircumnavigation of the\ntown, they returned and\ncollected their slightly\nbetter-rested friends for\na run out and around\n\u201cBritain\u2019s finest Iron Age\nhill fort\u201d: Maiden Castle.\nTo the disappointment of\nalmost everyone, it soon\nbecame apparent that\nthere is no actual castle\nat Maiden Castle and it\nis in fact just a hill. This\ntook nothing away from\nthe blissful fresh air and\nstunning countryside\nviews on offer, however,\nand they completed many\nlaps around the summit\nbefore returning home to\nshower, eat, and pack.\nThe return journey to\nLondon was (fortunately)\nfar less eventful than the\noutward journey and the\nexhausted team cruised\nback to campus by 18:30\non Sunday evening.\nHopefully the runners\nwill be fully recovered in\ntime for team\u2019s next race\non Wednesday for the\nLUCA XC League at Ally\nPally \u2013 the hilliest (and\nmuddiest?) so far.

As the second quarter\nprogressed, Imperial\u2019s\nfears before the game\nwere becoming a reality\nwith UWE scoring several\ngoalswithoutanyresponse\nfrom Imperial. UWE\u2019s\ntactics were getting the\nbetter of Imperial, with\nchance after chance being\ncreated and being wasted\nwith bad shots and worse\ndecisions (editor\u2019s note:\nlike a night in Metric). By\nhalf time Imperial were\nlucky to only be losing 7-3\nafter some excellent saves\nby the stand-in goalkeeper\nDavid Moores.\nWith the third quarter\nbeginning, it was clear\nImperial were not willing\nto give up and would fight\ntogetthemselvesbackinto\nthe game. This was led by\ncaptain Sam Hanrahan\nand vice-captain Ramon\nFernandez-Mir scoring\nfour goals between them\nin quick succession. There\nwere some emotional\ncelebrations from Ramon,\nand he dedicated his goals\nto Christina Duckworth.\nAs the final quarter\nbegan the situation looked\nbleak for Imperial with\nthe score very much in\nUWE\u2019s favour and centre\nback Gian Ameri majored\nout, no longer being able\nto take part in the game.\nan Irish citizen only hours\nbefore the game, began\nthe comeback scoring\nand bringing Imperial\ncloser to UWE.

They\nlaunched the ball up to\ntheir centre forward and\nwith the rest of the team\nwatching on in despair,\nhe scored the winning\ngoal with just 5 seconds\nleft. What had looked to\nbe one of sport\u2019s greatest\never comebacks faltered,\nfailed, and UWE won.\nDespite the immediate\ndeflation of such a loss,\nthis was the best performance of the season for\nthe team and it is important\nthat the positives are taken\nfrom the game.

As\nyou may have guessed\nalready, you have higher\nchances to see them\nsomewhere up north,\nparticularly in Scotland.\nHowever, you\u2019ll be surprised to learn that Aurora\nBorealis has been noticed\nas south as Oxfordshire\nand Cornwall! But don\u2019t\nget too excited \u2013 this\nhappens rarely, and the\nchances of seeing them\nthere with the bare eye\nare definitely very low.\nIf conditions are almost\nperfect but you still can\u2019t\nsee anything, then try it\nwith your camera, since\nthe eye can\u2019t sense many\ncolours in low light while\na DSLR camera sensor\ncan. For a more detailed\nexplanation, ask your\nbiologist friends.\nWhat are they?\nThe northern lights are,\nin a few words, a \u201clight\nshow caused by collisions\nbetween electrically\ncharged particles released\nfrom the sun that enter the\nearth\u2019s atmosphere and\ncollide with gases such\nas oxygen and nitrogen\u201d,\nas explained by Aurora\nService Europe. Since\nthis is a phenomenon\nthat can be seen above\nboth magnetic poles of\nthe Earth (and usually\nhappens at the same\ntime), there are also\nsouthern lights, or Aurora\nAustralis. And, as the\nAurora Service mentions,\n\u201cnorthern and southern\nauroras are mirror-like\nimages that occur at the\nsame time, with similar\nshapes and colours\u201d.\nfordshire or Cornwall (if\nthey are strong enough).\nIn Northern Ireland, they\ncan be seen from Antrim\nor Rathlin Island. And if\nyou\u2019re in Wales, try the\nBrecon Beacons.\nFor more vibrant\ncolours, you may prefer\nto travel outside the UK.\nOther European destinations include Norway,\nSweden, Finland, and\nIceland. They are close\nto the UK, and you can\nfind many good deals\non flight tickets, so keep\nan eye out. In Norway,\npopular viewpoints gather\nclose to Troms\u00f8, Alta,\nand Kirkenes; in Sweden,\ncheck out Abisko, Jukkasj\u00e4rvi, and Lule\u00e5; in\nFinland, well-known\nAurora Borealis places\nare Muotka, Kilpisj\u00e4rvi,\nand Luosto; and last but\nnot least is Iceland, where\nyou can see the Northern\nLights from locations just\noutside of the capital Reykjavik or the South Shore.\nIf you have more time\nand money to spare, you\nmay want to reach further\nahead and travel up to\nGreenland or Canada.\nHow to get there?\nAnother important\nquestion is \u201cHow am I\ngoing to get there now?\u201d\nI\u2019m afraid to tell you that\nyour options are quite\nlimited. In order to have\nmore chances to see this\nmagical phenomenon,\nyou need to be away\nfrom large cities, which\nmeans limited or no\npublic transport! Even if\nthere\u2019s a bus or a train, it\nwill most probably not be\navailable at the time you\nwant it. So your options\ninclude finding a way to\nget to the nearest town\n(plane/train/bus) and\nthen paying someone to\ndrive you to your final\ndestination (which might\nbe expensive) or renting\na car yourself (either from\nLondon or the closest\nlarge city). Car rental\ncould be costly as well,\nunless you are already 25\nyears old because most\ncar hire companies have\nan extra fee for under 25\u2019s\n(that makes no sense to\nme because you may be\n26y/o but have got your\nlicense just two days\nbefore but that\u2019s another\ntopic to discuss).\nWell, what happens if\nyou don\u2019t have a driver\u2019s\nlicense (like me) and can\u2019t\nafford to pay for overnight\ntaxis? Simply find a friend\nwho has one and ask him/\nher to come with you. The\nmore, the merrier, and\nalso cheaper!\nLast tips\nMake sure you spend\nat least a couple of nights\nthere. It\u2019s not easy to\nplan such a trip ahead as\nweather conditions are\nunpredictable. Cloudy\nand foggy nights can spoil\nyour view. But there are\nsome online tools that\ncan help. For instance, the\naforementioned Aurora\nService Europe or Aurora\nWatch UK, which report\nthe latest information\nabout the northern lights\nin Europe and the UK, are\nworth checking out before\ntravelling. They even send\nout notifications and alerts\nupon subscription.\nEd: For more travel\nstories and tips, visit\nElina\u2019s blog at \t\t\nempnefsysandtravel.com\nTRAVEL\nSo magical and surreal, the Lights are worth sacrificing a weekend for // Pixabay\nWhat an Instagram-worthy view! #goals #like4like // Pixabay\nScandinavian countries are famous for offering the best views of northern lights, or Aurora Borealis, especially\nvisible above the North Magnetic Pole. However, getting up there may not be the best value for money. Luckily,\nthere are some UK locations, where you can enjoy the lights for a short study break.\n\u201cThe Aurora\nBorealis has\nbeen noticed\nas south as\nOxfordshire\nand Cornwall!\u201d\nWhere to see them?\nThere are many places\nin Scotland, some popular\nonesincludingtheScottish\nHighlands, Aberdeenshire, the Isle of Skye (on\nmy own bucket list), and\nthe Galloway Forest Park.\nIn England, you can try\nviewing them at the Lake\nDistrict and even Ox-\n"

It\nwas the year that he saw\nhis phenomenal eight-year Billboard Hot 100\nStreak finally come to\nan end - prior to August\n2017, Drake had had a\nsong in the charts every\nweek since May 2009 - .\nThe lukewarm reception\nto More Life suggests\nthat Drake\u2019s days of\ndominating the charts\nare behind him, and it is\nbecoming apparent that\nDrake is slowly passing\nhis peak. This could\nperhaps explain this\nperiod of unusual silence\nfrom him - since featuring\non Metro Boomin\u2019s \u2018No\nComplaints\u2019 in June,\nDrake has only appeared\non one song - . Drake\u2019s\nnext album is, therefore,\nall the more important;:\nwill he be able to drop\na classic to reclaim the\nthrone of hip-hop and cast\nhis legacy beyond doubt?\n9\nIsaiah Rashad\nTDE ran 2017 with\nboth the best hip-hop\nand R&B albums of the\nyear (Kendrick Lamar\u2019s\nDAMN. and SZA\u2019s CTRL,\nrespectively). Naturally,\nI\u2019m excited to see what all\nthe artists from the label\nhave in store for us in\n2018 but I\u2019m particularly\nexcited to hear from Isaiah\nRashad whose debut\nalbum, The Sun\u2019s Tirade,\nwas one of my favourite\nalbums from 2016.\n8\nJay Rock\nContinuing the TDE\ntrend, the label\u2019s stalwart\nartist, Jay Rock, has been\nrelatively quiet since his\nimpressive 2015 album,\n90059.Hehasbeenteasing\nthe follow up album and\nrecently dropped the\nKendrick Lamar and Future-assisted lead single,\n\u2018King\u2019s Dead\u2019. Jay Rock\n7\nTravis Scott\nAstroworld\nThrough his intense live\nshows - the night show\nis truly a one of a kind\nexperience -, Travis Scott\nhas garnered a crazed fan\nbase and, despite teasing\nthese fans for over a year,\nit appears that we are\nno closer to any official\nannouncements regarding\nthe release of his third\nalbum, Astroworld. In\nDecember, he surprised\nfans with his long-awaited\ncollaborative album with\nQuavo, Huncho Jack,\nJack Huncho. However\n,it was disappointing and\nsurprisingly lacked chem-istry. Travis is still one\nof the most creative and\ninfluential artists in the\nculture so I can\u2019t wait to\nhear what he does with his\nupcoming solo material.\n6\nA$AP Rocky\nAlthough he appeared\non multiple features in\n2017, including A$AP\nMob\u2019s collaboration Cozy\nTapes, Vol. 2: Too Cozy,\nthe lack of solo material\nfrom A$AP Rocky, the\nleader of the Mob, is bordering on the ridiculous\nnow. He has left fans\ncompletely in the dark,\nwith little more than the\npromise of \u2018experimental\nsounds\u2019 and a few Instagram snippets from the\nalbum to go by. For A$AP,\nmusic has seemingly taken\na backseat to his other\ninterests high-fashion and\nacting. It will be interesting to hear if he can reach\nthe heights of his stellar\nprevious albums.\n5\nPost Malone\nBeerbongs &\nBentleys\nPost Malone\u2019s debut\nalbum, Stoney, which\nwas released in December\n2016, unfortunately flew\nunder the radar. This was\nperhaps due to a lack of\npromotion or the fact\nthat it dropped on the\nsame day as J.Cole\u2019s 4\nYour Eyez Only. With\n\u2018rockstar\u2019, his 21 Savage\nassisted tune, dominating\nthe charts and breaking\nthe record for the longest\ntime spent at number one\non Spotify, Post has disproved all the haters that\nwere convinced he would\nbe a one-hit wonder after\nhis breakout single \u2018White\nIverson\u2019. His eclectic style\nis apparent throughout all\nhis projects; I\u2019m excited\nto hear how he crafts this\nupcoming release.\n4\nChance The\nRapper\nChance The Rapper\ndominated 2016 and has\nsince held the position of\nhip-hop\u2019s golden child.\nHe deservedly won\nthree awards at the 2017\nGrammys and he could\nseemingly do no wrong.\nHowever, the murmurs\nof discontent have been\nbubbling under the surface\nin the culture and Chance\nhas found himself having\nto deny rumours of being\nan \u2018industry plant\u2019 and\ndefend his claims of being\nindependent. Chance has\nthe potential to grab the\nhip-hop throne therefore\nit makes his follow up to\nColoring Book even more\ncrucial.\n3\nKanye West\nTurbo Grafx 16\nWe still haven\u2019t\nheard from Kanye West\nsince the cancellation\nof the remainder of his\nSaint Pablo tour and his\nwell-documented mental\nbreakdown, following\nhis wife, Kim Kardashian\u2019s, traumatic robbery\nMUSIC\nAndy Djaba\nMusic Editor\nWith TDE\u2019s bench ready to drop and a possible new Queen of rap, here\u2019s what we\u2019re looking forward to in 2018\n\u201cTDE ran 2017\nwith the hiphop and R&B\nalbums of the\nyear \u2013 Kendrick\nLamar\u2019s DAMN.\nand SZA\u2019s\nCTRL\u201d \u201cThe lack of\nsolo material\nfrom A$AP\nRocky, the\nleader of\nthe Mob, is\nbordering on\nridiculous\u201d\n\u201cChance has\nfound himself\nhaving to\ndeny rumours\nof being an\n\u2018industry plant\u2019\nand defend his\nclaims of being\nindependent\u201d\nWikimedia\nBleacher Report\n\u201cFans can at\nleast look\nforward to\nan explosive\nresponse\nto Jay Z,\nwith whom\nKanye has\nan ongoing\nfeud...\u201d\nPandering to the collective\n2\nNicki Minaj\nNicki Minaj is at a\npivotal point in her career.\nOutside of her core fans\n(or \u2018Barbz\u2019), the wider\nhip-hop community\nseems to have had enough\nof her dominance in rap.\nShe hasn\u2019t dropped an\nalbum since 2014\u2019s The\nPinkprint and Remy Ma\nsuccessfully won their\nbeef in February. Nicki\u2019s\nlacklustre response to\nRemy left her position as\nthe Queen of rap looking\nextremely fragile. Despite\nkilling several features\nthis year (\u2018MotorSport\u2019\nand \u2018Rake It Up\u2019 come to\nmind), Nicki\u2019s solo efforts\nhave completely missed\nthe mark. Fans are tired of\nhearing her repeat her favourite bar, \u201cthese bitches\nis my sons\u201d, and even\ndrawing for the Drake plus\nLil Wayne combo feature\n(or the Young Money care\npackage) couldn\u2019t stop her\nsingle, \u2018No Frauds\u2019, from\nflopping. The meteoric\nrise of Cardi B\u2019s rap\ncareer in the last year is\nfurther cause for Nicki\nto be concerned. In order\nfor her to cement her\nposition as the Queen of\nrap, it is imperative that\nNicki delivers with this\nupcoming album.\n1\nCardi B\nIn two years, Cardi\nB has transitioned from\nstripper to reality TV star\nto the first female rapper\nto claim the top spot on\nthe Hot 100 chart since\nLauryn Hill in 1998.\nCardi has taken the music\nindustry by storm and her\nhilarious social media\nantics have endeared\nher to fans across the\nworld. The success of her\nbreakout single, \u2018Bodak\nYellow\u2019, naturally led to\nthe inevitable question\nof whether she would be\nable to follow it up. She\nanswered this question by\nbecoming the first female\nrapper to simultaneously\nland her first three entries\nin the top ten of the Hot\n100 (\u2018Bodak Yellow\u2019,\n\u2018MotorSport\u2019 and \u2018No\nLimit\u2019). Cardi first announced that her debut\nalbum would be released\nlast October but, with\nher buzz still growing at\nfeverish pace, she took\nthe wise decision to delay\nits relase. 2018 is the\ntime for Cardi to drop her\nmajor label debut album.\nI\u2019m intrigued to hear what\na Cardi B album sounds\nlike and to see how she\nhandles the pressure and\nweight of expectation\non her shoulders. Due to\nthe unfortunate reality\nof misogyny in hip-hop,\nCardi B\u2019s music has\nbeen directly compared\nto Nicki Minaj\u2019s and the\nindustry has effectively\nmanufactured a feud\nbetween these women.\nAlthough this Cardi\nalbum will be a clear\nindication of whether she\ncan succeed Nicki as the\nresident Queen of hip-hop,\nit is important for hip-hop\nfans and general lovers of\nthe culture to remember\nthat these artists should\nbe celebrated in their own\nright. Despite the fact\nthat the supposed female\nrap beef is entertaining\nand adds drama to the\nsituation, pitting these\nartists against each other\nis something we should\ncondemn as society.\nP\nanda Bear, born\nNoah Lennox,\nhas become a\nprevalent figure\nwithin the indie music\ncommunity. A purveyor\nof genres, Lennox and his\nartistic counterpart Avey\nTare (Michael Portner)\nhave created some of the\nwildest and most original\ncompositions from the\nmysterious space they\nseem to occupy in the\nmusic world. Animal\nCollective\u2019s work,\nbefore and including\nMerriweather Post\nPavilion, have been heralded as masterful works\nof experimental pop and\nfolk music.\nBut somewhere\nsomehow, Lennox\u2019s\nsolo work started to\novershadow Animal Collective\u2019s output. Well, not\nsomehow. Person Pitch\nwas released in 2007. The\nsingle greatest Animal\nCollective record was a\nhazy, anti-social and weird\nPanda Bear solo LP. Like\nLoveless is to shoegaze,\nPerson Pitch, undeniably\nLennox\u2019s magnum opus,\nwould later become the\ndefining psych-pop record\nof the 21st Century thus\nfar.\nLennox continued by\nputting out two good,\nverging on great, albums.\nThen, out of absolutely\nnowhere, he dropped A\nDay with The Homies, a\n29-minute EP, just a week\nago today. With this, and\na sudden increase in social\nmedia activity, Lennox is\nessentially drafting up\nbuzz, for what might be\nhis 5th solo LP.\nWith that in mind,\nHomies could possibly be\na bunch of outtakes from\nthe forthcoming album, or\nperhaps not. Regardless,\nthe tracks hold up on their\nown. While generally\ndisconnected thematical-ly, sonically everything\nblends into one, as is\ntrademark of an Animal\nCollective member.\nEvery track sways back\nand forth, warped and\nwrapped by sounds from\nnature and bizarre sonic\ntextures. Lennox\u2019s best\nBrian Wilson impression\ncomes through again,\nlike ever, transforming\nthe obfuscated hazy production into something\nethereal. Choir boy vocals\nran through an SP-404\ndelay makes for a dreamy\nsoundscape in which you\ncan easily lose yourself.\nIn my personal copy\nof Person Pitch, the inner\nbooklet lists a bunch of\nartists who have directly\ninfluenced Lennox\u2019s\nwork. It is perhaps\nstrange that Lennox, who\ndabbles in all forms of\npsychedelic music, would\nbe so heavily inspired by\ntechno musicians such as\nWolfgang Voigt and Deep\nHouse architect Luomo\namongst many others.\nThen again perhaps it\nisn\u2019t. The majority of\nLennox\u2019s work has had a\nprevalent \u2018driving force\u2019\nbehind it, reminiscent\nof common techno beat\npatterns.\nHomies is however,\nvery upfront about this,\nwith a bouncy kick drum\nand a buzzy bass on\nopener \u2018Flight\u2019, continuing the \u2018Mr. Sonic Boom\u2019\nsounds off of Lennox\u2019s\nprevious solo effort\nPanda Bear Meets the\nGrim Reaper. Despite all\nthe highs of this album,\ndreamy soundscapes can\nonly do so much. Structurally it is inherently\ndeficient, in the sense that\nis only an EP. That said,\nAnimal collective have\nhad standout EP\u2019s such\nas Fall Be Kind. Though\nLennox\u2019s current shtick,\nthe \u2018busy for the sake\nof being busy\u2019 sound, is\noccasionally annoying\nhere; he still this manages\nto make it a more memorable experience than one\nof the last two Animal\nCollective albums.\nOn Homies, Lennox essentially gives us a taste of\nthe upcoming album. Yet,\nit stands rather well on its\nown. Whatever Noah has\nbeen brewing over the last\ncouple of years, I want it.\nToo small to read? Good job it\u2019s vinyl only // Domino\nHollywood Life\n\u201c The success\nof breakout\nsingle,\u2018Bodak\nYellow\u2019, led to\nthe inevitable\nquestion of\nwhether she\nwould be able\nto follow it up\u201d\nMUSIC\nSuraj G\nMusic Writer\nArtist: Panda Bear. Label:\nDomino. Top Tracks:\nFlight; Sunset. For Fans Of:\nAnimal Collective; Flaming\nLips; Deerhunter; 29 minutes\nA DAY WITH THE\nHOMIES\nis criminally underrated\nbut, after revealing in an\ninterview with REAL 92.3\nLA that the upcoming LP\nwill be released through\nboth TDE and Interscope,\nthe additional major label\nbacking may prove to\npropel this album and\ngive Jay Rock the respect\nhe deserves.\nat gunpoint in Paris.\nHowever, Kanye\u2019s legacy\naffords him the luxury of\nalways making the list of\nmost anticipated hip-hop\nalbums for any given year.\nKanye first announced\nTurbo Grafx 16 in one\nof his infamous Twitter\nrants, shortly after his last\nrelease, The Life of Pablo\nin February 2016. Almost\ntwo years later, and there\nhas still been no indication of what this album\nwill sound like or what we\nshould expect. Fans can at\nleast look forward to an\nexplosive response to Jay\nZ, with whom Kanye has\nan ongoing feud and who\nmentioned him on \u2018Kill\nJay Z\u2019, the intro track\nfrom 4:44.\n\n"

I\u2019ve\nheard ska-punk,\nworld, prog jazz, hardcore\nfolk, and a dozen other\ndescriptors chucked their\nway, none sticking in any\nsense of the word (best\nI\u2019ve seen is \u201cmariachi\nband from hell\u201d).\nBut if there\u2019s one word\ndescriptor agreeable to the\nrowdy-devoted-vibrant\ncommunity that\u2019s grown\naround this marvellous\nband, it\u2019s formative. I\ndivide my experience as\na music listener into two\nepocs: the pre-Streetlight\nand the post-Streetlight.\nFalling into the band is a\nlife-altering experience\nlike falling into a black\nhole might stretch you out\na bit. Lead singer Tomas\nKalnoky released covers\nof their songs as acoustic\nballads; I find them so\ndeeply moving that I\u2019ve\nplayed nylon-string\nacoustic guitar for the\nlast five years, trying my\ndamnedest to sound like\nhim - someday I\u2019ll be\ngood - . My first mosh pits\nwere at Streetlight shows\n- and nobody moshes\nbetter than those crazy\nmotherfuckers - . The fundamentals of my very taste\nin music were decided\none fateful day when a\nmuch younger I stumbled\nacross them by chance.\nDallas. Cleveland.\nBurlington. The three\nthousand in attendance\n(the show sold out) must\nhave, altogether, traveled\na hundred thousand miles\nto see this show. This\nisn\u2019t unusual. When I saw\nKalnoky solo in London,\na steady crowd of individuals bearing Streetlight\ntattoos regaled their\nstories of flying to the US\nto catch them on tour. Here\nin NYC, I heard stories of\nconcerts in Portland, LA,\nOrlando \u2014 all fantastic,\nall moving, all beautiful.\nIt\u2019s said that the Mountain\nGoats have a passionate\nfollowing; funny, then,\nthe crossover fanbase.\nAfter the house lights\nforty-piece orchestra was\nnot there for show; they\nwasted no time leaping\ninto audaciously-layered\nrhythms and exotical-ly-flavored harmony,\nwonderously syncopated\nand perfectly complementing the ska-punk\nnucleus performing at\nthe front of the stage. The\ncrowd was exuberant; they\nwasted precisely no time\nbefore expressing their\nloves with throaty shouts\nof adoration for the band.\nThe setlist meandered\nfrom folk ballads evoking\nrustic frustration at a government in its waning days\n(underscored by the anti-capitalism of the fanbase)\nto skanking bangers presented in orchestral glory\n(\u201cA Moment of Silence,\u201d\ndisintegrating into the\nflatout-punk \u201cA Moment\nof Violence\u201d). There\nwere quick and animated\nsongs with flourishing\nfanfares (see \u201cWe Will\nFall Together\u201d) and\nfleeting, tender slow bits\n(\u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d\nand slow by Streetlight\nstandards). The end of the\n(non-encore) setlist was\nan amalgamation of pure\nenergy: \u201cWhat a Wicked\nGang are We\u201d, \u201cIf and\nWhen We Rise Again\u201d,\nand the pathos-rich \u201cReceiving End of it All\u201d.\nTomas told us not to sit\ndown for the last one, but\nit\u2019s not like anyone was\nanyways at that point.\nA jaw-dropping\naddition to the band was a\npiano soloist, Guy Mintus\n- and now forever known\nin Streetlight mythos as\n\u201cMr Piano Guy,\u201d as per\nKalnoky\u2019s comment - .\nMintus, a virtuoso concert\npianist, would perform\nbrilliant reworkings of\neach song preceding the\norchestra, and dazzled\nall present with the his\nsheer musicianship\ninvolved. A few screams\npleaded with Streetlight\nto make Mr Piano Guy\nan ordinary member of\nthe band - and for the\nrecord, he\u2019d fit right in - .\nTime and time again,\nStreetlight Manifesto\nbrings unparalleled\nenergy to the stage, electrifying the audience and\ngalvanizing them to the\nband. There\u2019s a reason\nthey have such a loyal\nfollowing: to this day,\nStreetlight manages to\ndemonstrate that they are\nin a league of their own.\nOne last thing: rumor\non the street is that a\nUK tour is in the works.\nSee you there, chumps.\nMUSIC\nHenry Eshbaugh\nMusic Editor\nSupport Artist: None.\nVenue: Beacon Theatre,\nNYC.

With a new solo album out from each, Ziying Fang gives his verdict on who came out on top.\nMUSIC\nZiying Fang\nMusic Writer\nA\nh, the solo\nalbum. The\nbastard child\nof the ageing\nartist. The vanity project\nmarketed at the die-hard\nfans who couldn\u2019t deal\nwith the terrible truth that\ntheir favourite band broke\nup nearly a decade ago,\nnow reduced to eating\nthe crumbs that fell off\nthe table. \u201cCritics be\ndamned\u201d, they agonise,\n\u201cthis album showcases\ntheir raw, untainted,\ntalent and personality\u201d.\nDENIAL. Desperately,\nthey cling onto the notion\nthat had they had the courage to risk an affair with\nthe capricious mistress\nof Fame and Fortune, it\ncould\u2019ve been them. Alas.\nTheir only recourse now\nis to fork out \u00a310 a month\nto Spotify and Apple\nMusic to support the artist\nin their cocaine and caviar\nhabits. That or deal with\nthe crushing mediocrity\nthat is life itself.\nBut what do I know,\nmaybe I\u2019m just bitter that\neveryone else\u2019s favourite\nbands (Gorillaz, The\nKillers, The Strokes, U2)\nhad a new release last\nyear. Yet, the only thing\nArctic Monkeys fans got\nwas a disappointing meteorological event sharing\na name with the track\n\u2018Brianstorm\u2019.\nBut look at me dancing\naround the issue. Dancey,\ndancey, dancey, la di da.\nALRIGHT, LET\u2019S GET\nTO THE POINT. Are\nthe new albums by the\nGallagher brothers good?\nYES. MAYBE. Are they\nbetter than Oasis? NO.\nWhat you have to\nunderstand is that for any\nalbum to be comparable\nwith Oasis, it has to be inventive both lyrically and\nmelodically. Not enough\non the lyrical front, like\nNoel\u2019s Who Built the\nMoon, and you\u2019re left\nfeeling you\u2019ve wasted\ntime on the \u2018artsy fartsy\u2019,\nlike an evening out listen\u201cIt has all the\ncomforts of\na Bruce Willis\nmovie. You go\nto it when you\nneed to turn\nyour brain off.\u201d\ning to prog-rock backed\nPoetry Slam. Not enough\non the melodic front, like\nLiam\u2019s As You Were, and it\nfeels like you\u2019re being fed\na stream of half-cooked\nmetaphors-cum-advice\nuntil the point you\u2019d like\nto ram a sharp implement\nthrough your own head.\n(Do not try this at home).\nSongs like \u2018Wonderwall\u2019,\nfor the lack of a better\nphrase, do wonder simply\nbecause they so readily\nconvey the type of mid-dle-class comfort and\ninarticulacy that culminates in phrases like \u201c...all\nthe road we have to walk\nare winding\u201d. A banal\nplatitude, sure, but a banal\nplatitude that in the lens of\nOasis sounds like genuine\nlife advice.\nI am, of course, aware\nthat there may be Oasis\nfans reading this review\nright now. And to be completely honest, it\u2019s not all\nthat fair for me to tear apart\nany emotional attachment\nanyone has constructed\naround the phenomenon\nof Britpop. I should know\nbetter; I spent my formative years listening to\nNirvana and Janis Joplin\ntrying to dig my way out\nof the awkward years of\nschoolboy adolescence.\nMuch of music criticism\nIS subjective, and I would\nbe lying if I said that I\ndon\u2019t derive as much\njoy as I do from hating\nTaylor Swift if I weren\u2019t\nsatisfying myself on the\nfact that I am attacking\nthe people who didn\u2019t\nshare the same experience\ngrowing up as I did. (The\nbloody wankers never\nseem to have needed to\ndeal with puberty and\nthe immense self-doubt\nthat came with it.) The\ntruth is, Oasis wrote their\nown music, and that,\nby definition, puts them\nabove 70% of pop music\ntoday. Liam Gallagher\nmay have as much of way\nwith words as a grizzly\nbear on ice has a talent for\nballet, but I suppose that\u2019s\npart of his charm. The\nsame can be said of Noel,\nwhose \u2018Holy Mountain\u2019\nreminds me pleasantly of\nFranz Ferdinand and their\npsychedelic pussyfooting\nin asking a girl on a date.\nIs it a material for Nobel\nPrize for Literature?\nPerhaps not, but it has all\nthe comforts of a Bruce\nWillis movie. You go to\nit when you need to turn\nyour brain off.\nNonetheless, if you\u2019re\nnot a fan and belong the\ngroup of people who read\nreviews to see what\u2019s\nworth your time, I would\nsay go for Noel\u2019s album.\nIt\u2019s the lesser of two evils:\nLiam can come off as\nabrasive, and the stealing\nof canned phrases from\nthe Beatles does get on\nyour nerve when he does it\nthe Nth time. (It took me 4\nweeks to stopped cringing\nwhen he unthinkingly\nparodies Lennon\u2019s \u2018Happiness Is A Warm Gun\u2019).\nWhen you get used to it,\nand let the melody wash\nover the lyrics, it is pretty\npleasant. But before that,\nthe choice of \u2018Chinatown\u2019\nas a romantic setting just\nconjures images of damp\nstreets, massage parlours\nand pick-pockets in\nLeicester Square. You\u2019d\nthink the brothers would\nhave taken a song-writ-ing course with their all\nBritpop success by now.\nYeah man so I want it to look like it\u2019s made of paper, but without actually making it out of paper, that\u2019d be pretty fucking sick. // Warner Bros.,\nSour Mash\n\u201cLiam\nGallagher may\nhave as much\nof way with\nwords as a\ngrizzly bear on\nice has a talent\nfor ballet, but I\nsuppose that\u2019s\npart of his\ncharm.\u201d\n\u201cStreetlight\nManifesto - the\nmariachi band\nfrom hell\u201d\ndropped, the band commenced with an anthemic\nthrowback to the original\nBOTAR EP, which turns\n17 this year: \u201cThis is\na Call to Arms/Here\u2019s\nto Life\u201d a song with a\ncrowd-vocal intro leapt\ninto by the entire three-thousand-strong audience\nin a wonderous expression\nof the camaraderie felt by\nfollowers of the band.

The story follows\nElaine Renko (Agyness\nDeyn) and Charlie Hicks\n(Jim Sturgess), two\ndetectives who stumble\nupon a government leak\ndescribing \u2018Hard Sun\u2019 \u2013 a\ncatastrophic event that\nwill cause the end of the\nworld in 5 years\u2019 time. Set\nin an alternative present,\nthe six-part series weaves\na flush of expected\ncop-drama themes with a\nlooming doomsday plot.\nButwhileittriestoseem\ngritty and rough around\nthe edges, with a flavour-some array of colloquial\naccents and over-the-top\nviolence, it falls short in\nestablishing a realism in\nall the kerfuffle. The characters are drawn out in a\nrudimental and clumsy\nfashion, but Sturgess and\nDeyn have fun with the\nhammy affair, evident in\ntheir performances. We\njust go along with it. What\nyou get is an enjoyable\nyet clich\u00e9d detective-mel-odrama with a refreshing,\nalbeit side-lined, set-up.\nWhat ensues is a slick\ndrama that appreciates its\npremise but isn\u2019t in love\nwith it; there are many\ndifferent back alleys the\nplot could\u2019ve taken but\nit cops-out and strays\naway from the enormous\npotential in its premise.\nNeil Cross sticks to what\nhe knows, and this can be\nfrustrating.\nThe whole series has\na certain visual style as\nif it were adapted from\na graphic novel, but not\nenough substance to\njustify its aesthetic. Its\nambitions are clearly\nset high, as it tries to\ndelve into an intelligent\nexploration on morality,\nreligion, and justice, but\nthe frequent pantomime-y\ndialogue lets itself down.\nIf you expect anything\nmore than a standard\npolice drama, it is pedestrian and dissatisfactory.\nHard Sun is bonkers,\nstarting with the unconventional set-up, but a\npart of its indulgence is\nseeing how everything\nworks out in the end,\napocalypse and all. It is\na lot of fun for the most\npart: each episode follows\na loose formula presenting\na different murder case\nthat somehow, unconvinc-ingly, relates to the \u2018Hard\nSun\u2019 of the title. The\noverdramatic universe\nof Hard Sun is life as we\nknow it, but on Class A\nopioids\u2014 and that is its\npleasure. The six episodes\nrivet along sweetly at\na rewarding pace. Neil\nCross goes all out this pet\nproject, eager to please the\nfans, to flex his detective\ndrama muscles and Hard\nSun makes a cute addition\nto his expanding r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\nThe whole series was\nreleased on BBC iPlayer\nfrom 6th January, made\navailable for a month.\nWith the rise in popularity\nof on-demand TV and a\ngrowing culture of binge\nwatching, more and\nmore content seems to be\nmoving online with all\nepisodes released at the\nsame time.\nWhile it\u2019s unlikely that\nwe will see any further of\nHard Sun and its world in\nthe near future, I think it\nhas enough of a certain\ncharm about it to become\nan underappreciated gem\nfor fans of the current\nwave of contemporary\nBritish crime drama.\nHard Sun is available\non BBC iPlayer now.\nMmmmm, brooding // BBC\nAgyness Deyn and Jim Sturgess have enormous fun in Neil Cross\u2019 show, which is completely bonkers, but fails to\nmake the most of its interesting premise.\nTELEVISION\nSung Soo Moon\nTV Writer\nCreator: Neil Cross.\nStarring: Agyness Deyn,\nJim Sturgess, Nikki AmukaBird, Owain Arthur.\nHARD SUN\nFelix is Recruiting!\nWe\u2019re looking for new writers, editors, illustrators, photographers, grammar nerds, and\ncomputer whizzes to get involved with our great team.

On offer were\nfilms from the likes of\nMartin Scorsese and Elia\nKazan. It is fair to say\nthat since then Sundance\nhas been an integral\npart of the independent\nfilm revolution. If John\nCassavetes was the father\nthat conceived American\nindependent cinema,\nthen Robert Redford\u2019s\nSundance Institute was\nthe loving mother that\ntenderly nurtured it. A\ndecade later a 26 year old\nSteven Soderbergh took\nhis directorial debut to\nPark City, claiming the\nAudience Award at the\nfestival, and going on to\nwin the prestigious Palme\nd\u2019Or at the Cannes Film\nFestival, as well as earning an Academy Award\nnomination for Original\nScreenplay. Sex, Lies,\nand Videotape would go\non to be a huge financial\nsuccess, signalling the\nacceptance of young run-and-gun indie filmmakers\ninto both the hearts of the\nmainstream public and\nthe minds of the upper\nechelons of world cinema.\nIn the quarter of a century\nsince then the likes of\nPaul Thomas Anderson,\nQuentin Tarantino,\nDarren Aronofsky, Kelly\nReichardt, Wes Anderson,\nAva DuVernay, Damian\nChazelle and David\nO. Russell have all\ngotten their big break at\nSundance, either through\nthe Institute\u2019s many film\nprograms, workshops, and\nlabs, or through premiering their early projects at\nthe festival, underlining\nSundance\u2019s prominence\nin shaping the modern\ncinematic landscape.\nYet the last couple of\neditions of the Sundance\nFilm Festival have seen\na further evolution, with\nprestigious films premiering there in the hope\nof scoring major awards\nmore than a year later.\nCases in point include\n2014\u2019s Whiplash, which\nwent on to score five\nOscar nominations, and\n2016\u2019s Manchester by\nthe Sea, which went on to\nearn six. Last year\u2019s stellar\nline-up continued this\ntrend, with Get Out, The\nBig Sick, Mudbound, and,\nin particular, Call Me by\nYour Name all hoping for\nnods when the Academy\nAward nominations are\nannounced next week.\nThe festival has always\nserved as something of a\nshop window \u2013 for those\nwith films playing this is\nnot a traditionally enjoyable time, as their agents\nand producers desperately\nseek distribution deals.\n2017 saw an all-time high\nfor films being picked\nup, with the likes of A24,\nAmazon, and Netflix\nbeing serial offenders. As\never, the festival continued to put a diverse range\nof voices on display:\nLGBTQ+ films had a\nstrong showing with Call\nMe by Your Name, God\u2019s\nOwn Country, and Beach\nRats; Asian-American life\nwas given the spotlight\nin Columbus and Gook;\nand female directors\nEliza Hittman, Dee Rees,\nMaggie Betts, and Gillian\nRobespierre earned some\nof the best reviews of the\nfortnight.\nPerhaps most notable\nwere the astonishingly\nsmall-scale films that\nmeditatively dealt with\ncolossal themes of time\nand memory in A Ghost\nStory and Marjorie Prime.\nTwelve months ago we\nwere delivered one of\nthe finest Sundances in\nhistory, and a very good\nyear followed, with an\nextremely diverse Oscar\nrace still yet to play out.\nLet us now turn our attention to what the 2018\nfestival has in store.\nAs usual with\nSundance, a host of the\nfilms on show are debuts\nfrom new faces, and a\ngreat part of the fun is\ndiscovering budding\nAndersons, Tarantinos,\nSoderberghs, and Arodeliver awards friendly\ncrowd-pleasers such as\nGood Will Hunting and\nMilk, but far better known\nfor his quirky indies such\nas My Own Private Idaho\nand Drugstore Cowboy.\nAppreciated worldwide,\nas evidenced by his Palme\nd\u2019Or win for the haunting\nElephant, Van Sant has\nrecently been on a poor\nrun of form epitomised by\nthe much-maligned Sea of\nTrees. He enters Sundance\nwith Don\u2019t Worry, He\nWon\u2019t Get Far On Foot, a\ndark comedy biopic based\non controversial quadriplegic cartoonist John\nCallahan. The intriguing\nsubject of the film will\nbe portrayed by Joaquin\nPhoenix, reuniting with\nthe man who directed\nhim in his breakthrough\nperformance more than\ntwenty years ago in To\nDie For. Phoenix is joined\nby a strong cast including\nRooney Mara, Jonah Hill,\nand Jack Black, and the\nproject already has a May\nrelease date with Amazon\nStudios. Here\u2019s to hoping\nfor a return to form for\nVan Sant.\nCareful of your fingers Rob // COSMO\nLook at me, I am the captain now // Sundance\n\u201cSundance\nhas been\nan integral\npart of the\nindependent\nfilm\nrevolution\u201d\nnofskys at their earliest\nstages. It\u2019s difficult to say\nmuch about them, but we\ncan certainly speculate\non the biggest name at\nthis year\u2019s festival: Gus\nVan Sant. Van Sant is\na gifted auteur, able to\n\u201cGus Van Sant\nenters a dark\ncomedy biopic\nbased on\ncontroversial\nquadriplegic\ncartoonist\nJohn Callahan\u201d\nTwelve months ago Sundance kicked off a wonderful year for film \u2013 what will the 2018 edition bring?\nIt is increasingly\ncommon for actors, and\nthose in other fields, to\nmake their directorial\ndebut at Sundance. Last\nyear saw Taylor Sheridan\ncomplete the border\ntrilogy he wrote, following up Sicario and Hell or\nHigh Water by stepping\ninto the director\u2019s chair\nwith Wind River. This\nyear it is the turn of Paul\nDano (period drama\nWildlife), Rupert Everett\n(Oscar Wilde adaptation\nThe Happy Prince), Idris\nElba (crime film Yardie),\ncomedian Bo Burnham\n(comedy Eighth Grade)\nand rapper Boots Riley\n(comedic fantasy sci-fi\nSorry to Bother You).\nThough not making their\ndebuts, the relatively inexperienced Ethan Hawke\n(country music biopic\nBlaze) and cinematographer Reed Morano (sci-fi\nI Think We\u2019re Alone Now),\nfresh from dominating\nTV with The Handmaid\u2019s\nTale, are in the U.S.\nDramatic Competition.\nReturning to Park\nCity are festival veterans\nTamara Jenkins, the\nZellner brothers, Debra\nGranik, Brett Haley,\nand Desiree Akhavan. It\nhas been 11 years since\nJenkins premiered superb\ncomedy The Savages to\nhuge critical acclaim at\nSundance. Her latest, The\nPrivate Life, sounds in a\nsimilar vein, with Kathryn\nHahn as an author undergoing fertility treatment,\nplacing strain on her\nrelationship with her\nhusband, Paul Giamatti.\nThe Zellners impressed\nwith their last two films,\nKid-Thing and Kumiko,\nthe Treasure Hunter, at\nfourAcademyAwards and\ngave Jennifer Lawrence a\nbreakthrough role. Little\nis known about her new\nfeature, Leave No Trace,\nbut expect another gritty,\nhard-hitting drama. Haley\nis a Sundance regular, and\nis back again with Hearts\nBeat Louder, a piece about\nan unlikely father-daugh-ter song-writing duo,\nfeaturing Sasha Lane.\nLane, who broke out with\na starring role in Andrea\nArnold\u2019s 2016 Cannes\nprize-winning road film\nAmerican Honey, is also\nin Akhavan\u2019s follow-up to\nthe notable debut Appropriate Behaviour. Based\non the novel by Emily M.\nDanforth, The Miseducation of Cameron Post is a\ncoming-of-age tale about\na girl discovering her own\nsexuality.\nGary Oldman showing us how it\u2019s done-kirk\nD\narkest Hour\nbegins and ends\nwith a cacophony of yelling.\nAnd in the 120 minutes\nbetween these two shots,\nthere is plenty more shout-ing, although none do so\nlouder or more verbosely\nthan Gary Oldman, who\ntransforms himself into\nWinston Churchill for this\nfilm about the early days\nof his premiership.\nDirector Joe Wright\nchooses to narrow his\nfocus down to a period\nof a few weeks, from\nChurchill\u2019s assumption\nof the premiership against\nthe wishes of his own\nparty, to his famous \u201cWe\nshall fight on the beaches\u201d\nspeech, during which\ntime the evacuation of\nDunkirk was completed.\nWhile Wright expands his\nscope to include a number\nof peripheral charac-ters, including Winnie\nChurchill (Kristin Scott\nThomas) and secretary\nElizabeth Layton (Lily\nJames), it\u2019s clear that this\nis Oldman\u2019s film. It\u2019s the\nright decision, and allows\nthe film to rattle along at a\nrather lively place, whilst\nalso showing a point\nin Churchill\u2019s narrative\nwhen he wasn\u2019t a national\nhero. That being said,\nthe fact we know he will\neventually be absolved\nremoves some of the\nprecariousness from the\nstory.\nOldman manages to\nundergo, with help from\nheavy prosthetics, a startling transformation into\nthe Prime Minister \u2013 a feat\nmade more impressive\nwhen we consider how\nfixed Churchill\u2019s image is\nin our cultural conscious-ness. Oldman allows his\nChurchill to let his guard\ndown at a number of points\nin the film \u2013 particularly\nthe scenes with his wife,\nfor which Scott Thomas\ndoesn\u2019t get nearly enough\nscreen time. Rather than\ngoing down the traditional\nroute, well-trodden by\nthose who have played\nChurchill in the past, and\nportraying him as merely\nblustery and irritable,\nOldman pulls together a\nnumber of nuances and\naffectations to make his\nChurchill a more rounded\ncharacter. At key points\nin the drama, however,\nhe reverts to type, huffing\nand puffing through his\nlines.\nIt\u2019s lucky for Wright\nthat Oldman manages to\nrise to the challenge, since\nhe elevates what would\notherwise be a forgettable\nfilm. While Wright\u2019s cam-erawork is adept \u2013 despite\nan over-reliance on a\nnumber of formulaic shots\nand tracking decisions\n\u2013 this is a film where the\nactors have been glossed\nover, constrained within\na patina of overlighting,\nover-costuming, and\nover-scoring.\nIn other words, Darkest\nHour resembles any\nnumber of other big-budget historical dramas\n\u2013 The Imitation Game,\nSuffragette, The King\u2019s\nSpeech \u2013 which gives\nit a sense of datedness.\nWhile it\u2019s a style of film\nthat is, obviously, still\nbeing made, alongside its\nmore nimble compatriots\non the road to the Oscars\nit resembles a plodding\ndinosaur. An enjoyable\nwatch, but not a film that\ndoes much new, or stick in\nthe mind once the credits\nhave rolled.\nRon Swanson adds playing guitar to his list of favourite things // Sundance\nV for (Oscars) victory // Focus Features\nDir: Joe Wright.\nScript: Anthony McCarten.\nStarring: Gary Oldman,\nKristin Scott Thomas, Lily\nJames, Stephen Dillane. 125\nminutes\nFILM\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nDARKEST HOUR\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming\ncommon\nfor actors to\nmake their\ndirectorial\ndebuts at\nSundance\u201d\nSundance, and they return\nwith Damsel, a come-dy-Western sporting an\nimpressive cast including\nRobert Pattinson, Mia\nWasikowska, and Robert\nForster.

Yes, you heard right: Macedonia.\nDon\u2019t ask, just enjoy it.\nCOMMENT\nGrumpy Bastard\nComment Writer\nM\nacedonia as a\ncountry has\na very proud\nand ancient\nhistory. Originally the\nhome of the Mycenaean\nGreeks, after their demise,\nPhilip of Macedon arose\nto kick the shit out of\nAthens and Sparta and\nthen bequeathed his army\nto his son. Better known\nas Alexander the Great, he\nwas then able to beat the\nliving hell out of Darius\nof Persia. This was unfortunately over 2000 years\nago, and Macedonia has\nquietly sat on the sidelines\nof history ever since.\nNow, of course, the time\nfor Macedonia to make\nits triumphant return has\narrived!\nThe reason for this\nreturn to glory is simple.\nYes, Greece is now united\nand the sarissa is no\nlonger a revolutionary\ninvention capable of\nwinning battles against\nany equivalent power. It\nis no longer the time for\na group of noble companions to gallop across\nthe plains of the Middle\nEast and trample all in\ntheir path. For a country\nthat isn\u2019t allowed to use\nresidents of the former\nYugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia \u2013 have discovered a revolutionary new\nweapon and a new people\nto conquer. The weapon is\nof course fake news and\nthe victims are gullible\nmembers of democracy\u2019s\neverywhere.\nYes, the Macedonians\nare now the world famous\npurveyors of articles\ndesigned to fool readers\ninto believing a different\nreality that more closely\nconforms to their beliefs.\nForget Black Mirror\u2019s\ncrazy technology and\nKremlin stooges attempting to hack the American\nelection, in today\u2019s day\nand age it is important to\nremember where the true\npower in the world lies:\nwith Goran the fake news\neditor in the small city of\nVeles. Want someone to\nbelieve in a paedophile\nring centred around a\npizza restaurant? Goran\u2019s\nyour man! As long as\nyou\u2019re prepared to pay\ngood money, teenagers\nwith an internet connection will happily write a\nreality that more closely\nresembles your beliefs\nthat you can share with\nyour easily manipulated\nand gullible friends and\nfamily.\nIt really is remarkable\nthat a people trodden\ndown so far after generations of a communist dictator\u2019s rule have bounced\nback to truly understand\nwhat democracy is really\nall about: lying, but lying\nconvincingly.\nThe thing I am possibly\nmost impressed by is\nthe fact that they really\nget what people want to\nbelieve down to a tee. I\nmean there are some great\nsatirical news sites such as\nSouthend News Network\n(Milos Yiannopoulos\u2019\nfavourite) but I don\u2019t feel\nthey reach a wide enough\naudience to qualify as\nA true symbol of power in the modern world //wikimedia\ntruly influential.

The\nChristmas holidays\nare over, which\nmeans that winter has\nlost its magical charm and\nis now just cold and dark.\nBut fear not, for there is\na solution to your woes:\nchocolate.\nAs Imperial is heavy on\nthe science, I\u2019m sure many\nof us know that chocolate\nis a natural mood booster,\nthanks to chemicals such\nas phenylethylamine \u2013 the\n\u2018love drug\u2019 \u2013 and anadamide \u2013 which activates\ndopamine production.\nBut that\u2019s enough about\nthe chemical effects;\nchocolate still needs to\ntaste good for it to really\nlift those winter blues. So\nwhere better to start than\nthe hyped Dark Sugars.\nNaturally, as a highly\ntrendy chocolatier, Dark\nSugars is located in\nFirst impressions\nBefore even entering\nThe Cocoa House the\nluscious chocolate aroma\ntook over me, and I felt\nmyself entering a chocolate haze. The shop has a\nvery earthy vibe, with an\noverwhelming number of\nchocolates on display in\nwooden bowls in every\ncorner. The chocolates\nlooked irresistible, but I\nwas here for the famously\nhyped hot chocolate. So\nI pulled myself away\nfrom the gorgeous coffee\ntruffles I had spotted, and\nwent to the hot chocolate\nbar.\nThe hot chocolates\nThe board above the\ncounter listed a number\nof different flavours of hot\nchocolate such as ginger,\nnutmeg, salted caramel,\nand cardamom. I decided\nto go for something a\nbit different so I ordered\ncardamom. The drinks\nare made right in front of\nyou: firstly the spices are\nadded to the light milky\nhot chocolate and then\nthey cut up the huge slabs\nof chocolate (white, milk,\nor dark) on the counter\ninto thin shards to make\nthe decadent topping. My\ncup was quite literally\noverflowing with choco-Feeling those winter blues? Well then, some dopamine stimulating chocolate is in order!

The care that was put into making this chocolat-ier something special really shows, from the beautiful\nwooden d\u00e9cor to the amazing flavours of chocolates.\nThe hot chocolate really was incredible and although\nit is on the pricier side I still believe it is worth the\nhype.\nPrice\nHot chocolate: \u00a34.50\nBest part\nThe melting chocolate topping\nWorst part\nThe location (Brick lane is a little far for a daily\ntreat!)\n\u201cNow\nChristmas is\nover, winter\nhas lost its\ncharm, and is\nnow just cold\nand dark\u201d\nBrick lane. The founder,\nNyanga, opened the chocolate shop following three\nyears of researching cocoa\non her family\u2019s farm in\nGhana, a real commitment to understanding her\nproduct.

The new education secretary, Damian\nHinds, has committed to\nremove the 50% cap on\nthe number of students\nbelonging to a certain\nreligious denomination\nat a school. It is thought\nthat this would benefit\nprimarily Catholic\nschools, due to elements\nof Canon law that prevent\nCatholic schools from\nturning potential Catholic\nstudents away. Therefore,\nthere have been no\nfurther openings of any\nother Catholic schools\nin protest at this law. A\nDepartment of Education\nspokesman stated that the\nreason the cap should be\nscrapped is due to the fact\nthat Catholic and CofE\nschools consistently perform at a higher level than\nother schools. It is worth\npointing out that the same\ncannot be said for Muslim\nand some Jewish schools\nof which there have been\nnew openings since the\n50% cap was introduced\n10 years ago\u2026\nIn opposition to this\nproposal are the previous\neducation secretary and\nOfsted, who have stated\nthat by allowing schools\nto select 100% of their\nintake by faith it will not\nonly deny parents access\nto good local schools, but\nwill also lead to increasing\nsegregation that has been\nnicknamed \u201ceducation\napartheid.\u201d\nPersonally,asanatheist,\nI am totally opposed to\nfaith schools in general, as\nI do not believe that faith\nshould play any part in the\nrunning of a state. Faith,\nin my opinion, should be a\ndeeply personal thing that\nyou do not project onto\nothers and therefore is not\npresent in the running of\nschools or the selection\nof pupils for schools. That\ndoes not mean to say that\nI rule out encountering\nreligion in a school\nenvironment \u2013 in fact, I\npositively encourage it \u2013\nbut it should be taught in\nsuch a way as to be totally\nimpartial and discuss the\nsocial moral and ethical\nimplications of each\nreligion separately.\nIf I was being radical,\nthen a further proposition\nI would make would be\nto prevent children from\npracticing religion until\nthey are old enough to\nadequately understand\nit. I believe that certain\nvariants of faith foster an\nunhealthy and backward\nview of the world that is\nnot productive in today\u2019s\nsociety. If Theresa May\nis serious about ensuring\nthat British values are at\nthe core of the curriculum\nthen she will have to\naddress the fact that many\nvariants of faith today do\nnot embrace these values.\nTherefore it seems counterproductive on her\u2019s\nand the government\u2019s\npart to take this step,\nbut this probably stems\nfrom a lack of clear ideas\non exactly what British\nvalues are and what they\nstand for, due to the\ndivisive nature of the idea\nof British values.\nI imagine instead that\nthe main reasons for\nthe push towards faith\nschools is purely due to\nthe pushback on grammar\nschools. Theresa May\nwentintogovernmentwith\nthe grand plan to expand\ngrammar schools throughout the nation, because\nshe believes that they\nencourage social mobility\ndespite all evidence to the\ncontrary. However, the\nimplications of encouraging grammar schools\nhave solely resulted in a\nlarge scale failure to better\nprovide social mobility or\nhigher quality education\nfor people in the area,\noften resulting in extra\nprovision in areas that did\nnot require it, leaving the\nstate of chronic under-provision in other areas\nunresolved. It also did not\nhelp that there was significant stigma attached\nto grammar schools from\nwhen the decision was\nmade to abolish them,\nwhich made the proposal\nmore unpopular.\nI believe that the\nmotivation that Theresa\nagain May may not care\nabout social mobility, and\ninstead about catering for\nthe needs of Conservative\nvoters, who have pushed\nfor these selective schools\nthat are solely beneficial\nto them.\nIt may also be the case\nthat this is being carried\nout in order to appease\ncertain more conservative\nmembers of her party, such\nas Jacob Rees-Mogg, who\nhas spoken out against the\n50% limit. In light of the\ncurrent difficulties with\nBrexit, it may be seen as\na sop to those members of\nher party dissatisfied with\nthe current negotiations,\nappeasing them with more\nsafely right wing policies.\nThe idea of education\nas the battleground makes\nsense from an election\npoint of view, as it will\nstrengthen May\u2019s appeal\nto her Conservative base\nand those most affected\nby it will be least likely\nto vote. It also allows\nfor the creation of a qua-si-grammar school system\nwithout the massive\nopposition, as there is\nsignificantly less opposition to faith schools,\nwhich are accepted as a\nkey element in the British\nlandscape. The opposition\nis likely to come from less\npopular people such as in-tellectuals, humanists, and\natheists such as myself,\nand with everyone concentrating on Brexit and\nan ineffectual opposition\nit is likely that this policy\nwill go through relatively\nunchallenged.\nIt is only by resisting\npolicies such as this that\nsocial mobility can be\nachieved. Otherwise\nthis is the perfect crime\nagainst the children of the\nfuture.\nBooks are educational// Wikimedia\n\u201cThe push\ntowards faith\nschools is\ndue to the\npushback\nagainst\ngrammar\nschools\u201d\nMay has for pioneering\nfaith schools is under the\nmistaken belief that they\nwill benefit pupils by\nproviding a higher quality\nof education without\nacknowledging the role\na highly selective intake\nplays in ensuring how\ngood a school is, similar\nto the way a grammar\nschool works. When she\nmakes this assumption\nthat a better quality of\nschool would provide\na significant amount of\nsocial mobility fails to\nfactor in that the majority\nof Catholic parents are\nlikely to have significant\nsocial advantages and\nthereby the cause of\nsocial mobility would\nnot be advanced.
