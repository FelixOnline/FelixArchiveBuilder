However Indian papers on a recent Hockey tour reported his name\nas Quinee, so take your pick. He\u2019s a big\nlad, so if you have any beef with him,\nbest to take it up with the Editor-InChief, Dan Wan. He\u2019s a brittle chap. No\nidea exactly what he has in store for you\nas he is yet to burrow his way down to\nWest Wing basement, but it\u2019ll be good.\nHere\u2019s a fact about Quinee: around his\nneck he wares a dog tag. Not because\nhe\u2019s double hard, or because he used\nto be in the army. One side is inscribed\nwith the name of his girlfriend, and the\nother the date that they started going\nout. Thoughts to the usual address.\nRight, I believe he has lots of fun puzzles and games in store for you this\nyear, so keep your eyes peeled for new\ninventions to get those elusive ipods.\nipods?!? ipods you say? Well, yes fresh-ers, each year we host a FUCWIT (Fac-ulty/College/Union Wide Intelligence\nTable) league, offering points to the\nteam who manages to complete a puzzle and send it to coffee.felix@impe-rial.ac.uk. All puzzles and games are\neligible for points, and the team/person\n(there are two leagues) at the top of the\ntable come end of the year, are declared\nwinners. For all you freshers out there,\nif you use a college printer, you can scan\ndirectly to email and then forward the\nscanned file onto us.\nBasically you are going to do these\npuzzles bored in lectures, so send the\nanswer in and get ipods.

Professional sleek display panels set up as\na \u20183D walk-through\u2019 art installation\nlured visitors to examine it.\nOn closer inspection, the installation turned out to be as much about\nart as it was about science. The exhibition was part of the \u2018100 Women \u2013\n100 Visions\u2019 portrait series designed\nand commissioned by the student\nsociety Women in Science, Engineering and Technology (WSET) in order\nto raise awareness and attract young\nwomen towards a career in science.\nWSET was created in the summer\nof 2007 by several of Imperial\u2019s PhD\nstudents and began its activities in the\nacademic year of 2007/2008. The creation of the society was the culmination of a three-year project, funded by\nthe UK Resource Centre for Women\nin SET from 2004-2007, to encourage more female students to remain\nwithin SET industries after graduat-ing. \u201cThrough the events we organise\nwe aim to challenge the preconceptions students have about scientists\nand engineers, raise the profile of SET\ncareers for women, and provide budding women scientists with visible role\nmodels they can aspire to,\u201d says Eirini\nSpentza, one of the society\u2019s founders.\nTeamed with couple of science communication and computing students,\nWSET is now building a website where\nthe portrait series originally exhibited\nat the College\u2019s Main Entrance could\nbe viewed digitally by anyone with\naccess to internet. The website is under construction and will be available at www.imperialcollegeunion.\norg/100women100visions, with a special section designed for children.\n\u201cWe hope the website will give\nnew graduate students a sense of the\nbreadth of Imperial\u2019s great community\nof women scientists and engineers,\nand provide a starting point for making contacts and joining networks\naround College,\u201d says Ellin Saunders\nwho coordinated the portrait project.\nIf you have a passion for photogra-phy, the new photo competition which\nwill culminate in a mini exhibition at\nthe College might be the way to get involved with WSET.\n\u201cThis coming academic year we plan\nto host another photo project for stu-dents, where the students themselves\nwill go around campus and take pictures of the everyday life of women at\nImperial as well as capture their own\nexperiences at the College and share\nthese with others.\u201d says Ellin.\nOther planned activities include\na discussion panel for PhD students\nexploring different aspects of academic careers and the changing role\nand experiences of women in such\ncareers, and Robogals \u2013 a new project\nthat is currently recruiting volunteers.\nRobogals is run by student volunteers\nwho are trained in LEGO robotics and\nvisit schools to teach LEGO robotics\nto girls aged 11-14.\nBy engaging girls in robotics from\na young age in a fun and educational\nway, Robogals aims to increase the\ninterest and awareness of young girls\nin SET subjects and to enhance the\nnumber of girls undertaking these\ncourses at university.\nAnd if you have more ideas for\nWSET, the society\u2019s chair Aiman\nAlamNazki says \u201cwe are always looking for, and are open to, adding new\nprojects under our umbrella that will\nencourage and motivate the presence\nof women in SET fields.\u201d\n\u201cWe would love to hear from any\nnew students - male or female! We always welcome new perspectives and\nideas, and there is plenty of scope for\nanyone interested to expand the use of\nthe portrait exhibition or to contribute\nto the society\u2019s other activities\u201d says\nAiman, sending an open invitation to\nall new students out there.\nAiman and others at WSET are especially keen for students to get involved\nin their smaller photography project\nand Robogals project, both of which\ncan offer role models or icons that inspire the new generation to undertake\na degree in science and motivate them\nto perform important research.\n\u201cOur activities and projects offer\nstudents the benefit of knowing that\nthey are making a difference- not only\nto the female SET community but to\nthe entire SET community by breaking stereotypes, serving as role models\nfor girls and increasing the strength of\nwomen in SET.\u201d\nTo contact WSET, please email:\nwomen.set@imperial.ac.uk\nW\ne\u2019ll be totally honest\nand forthright. We have\nno solid news for you in\nthis here fresher\u2019s edition of Felix. Why? Because once upon\na time we were all freshers, and the last\nthing we were interested in was trying\nto broaden our minds with basic-level\nscience in a student newspaper. In\nfact, if you\u2019ve even turned to this page\nat all, then well done you! Is freshers\nweek really quite that bad this year or\nare you just one of the many thousand\npersonality-less reclusive drones here\nat Imperial who sit painfully in their\nrooms awaiting the release of that next\nproblem sheet? Well, don\u2019t do that (at\nleast yet. Soon enough everyone will\nrevert to type so no need to worry\nthere).\nHere we\u2019re going to explain a few\nhangover cures which may come in\nhandy over the start of your university\nlife. This is a time of your life to experi-ment, a time to not hold back and just\ngo for it \u2013 whatever \u2018it\u2019 may be. Crawl\nback into your shell too soon and you\u2019ll\nlook back when you\u2019re older and think\n\u2018why the bloody hell was I so reluctant\nto have a good time while I had the\nchance?\u2019\nOne thing which will undoubtedly\nhelp lubricate the wheels of social cohesion is alcohol. If you don\u2019t drink\n(whether it be out of choice for health,\nreligion etc \u2013 I couldn\u2019t care either\nway) then please ignore. If you do, then\ncontinue reading.\nIf you haven\u2019t yet learned/trialled/\nperfected the following techniques\nduring your early teenage years then\naside from asking you what the hell\nyou used to get up to on the weekend,\nwe will dictate some of the main contenders here.\nNathanLey Science Editor\nTogether now: ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall...\nOur top 10 hangover cures:\nPrevention, not cure:\n\u201cDon\u2019t drink in the first place!\u201d\nYeah, right.\nAdvil & Water:\nAdvil is an anti-inflammatory drug\nthat contains ibuprofen. Two or\nthree taken with a glass of water is\nsupposed to combat the two factors of dehydration and inflammation caused by a hangover. By taking this before bed you counter the\ninflammation before its really taken\nhold, as opposed to taking it in the\nmorning.\nWater/Lucozade/Gatorade:\nYou\u2019re hungover because you\u2019re\ndehydrated. Water combats dehy-dration. Capiche? But to optimise\nthe reversal of dehydration and the\nreplacement of the mineral rich\nbodily fluids that have been lost,\nyou may want to take some sort of\nIsotonic drink.\nSleep:\nSleep as much as possible. Your\nbody is working extra hard to try\nand rectify the mess you have made\nof your internal organs. This will\nmake you sluggish. If your banging\nheadache isn\u2019t keeping you awake\nthen try and go back to sleep, so\nyour poor neglected body doesn\u2019t\nhave as much work to do.\nFry-up:\nAfter a night\u2019s worth of boozing, the\ndigestive system gets put under a lot of\nstrain. Bacon, sausages and the works\nmay cause indigestion, but fat contains lots of calories so you will receive\na much-needed energy boost. Eggs\nand meat are rich in the amino acid\ncysteine, thought to be good at clearing out toxins.\nKeep drinking (hair of the dog):\nScientific evidence has proved that\nthis works, but only in the short term.\nWhile your body is busy dealing with\na new intake of booze, it suspends\nits torture until you\u2019re done drinking\nagain - and then it\u2019s back to hangover\nhell. So basically by doing this you\u2019re\njust avoiding the inevitable. If you\nwant a bit more science: when the liver\nbreaks down alcohol it deals with ethanol before methanol, of which methanol is the most toxic component, and\nby drinking more you delay the methanol metabolism.\nPainkillers:\nYou\u2019re better off avoiding painkillers\naltogether. If you desperately need\nsome, then take in moderation, but be\naware that aspirin and ibuprofen may\nirritate your stomach. Paracetamol\ngives the liver even more work to do.\nPopping pills shouldn\u2019t really be seen\nas the easy option.\nCold Shower:\nAside from the sweating, aching,\nand vomiting, one of the worst\nsymptoms of a hangover is that general feeling of dirtiness (often enhanced by actual dirtiness). Taking\na hot shower only worsens the situation as you\u2019ll sweat out what little\nwater remains and just add to the\nfeeling of queasiness. A cold show-er, however uncomfortable it may\nbe, shocks your system and gets\nyour blood flowing again, thereby\nhelping your body begin the hard\nwork of breaking down toxins. Just\na slight warning: Some say such\nshocks can actually be harmful,\nespecially if you\u2019re not as young as\nyou thought you were last night.\nExercise:\nResearch has suggested that the\nresults of going for that post-lash\njog may be worth the pain. By\npriming the pump of your booze-stalled circulatory system, aerobic\nexercise can help spur oxygen flow\nthroughout the body, which can in\nturn cause the faster breakdown of\ntoxins.\nA joint:\nApparently a few puffs can apparently do wonders for morning after\nnausea \u2013 but we obviously can\u2019t recommend it here.\n0/10\n9/10\n?/10\n7/10\n8/10\n2/10\n3/10\n5/10\n7/10\n9/10\n\n"

Despite the habitat that has colonised his upper lip, I\u2019m\nsure he has plenty of insights to share\nwith us over the coming year in his\ncombined roles of Deputy, News and\nMusic Editor.\nGilead has just stumbled straight off\nthe BBC set of University Challenge\nwhere he captained the Imperial College team. Whilst he may be receiving\ntongue-lashings from Jeremy Paxman,\nGilead has just as a sharp-witted mind,\nlongside a vocabulary so extensive it\nputs the Oxford English Dictionary to\nshame. Read his Comment piece this\nweek to see the substance behind the\nclaims.\nThe rest of the team consists of an\neclectic and entertaining mix of lads\nand lasses. Each of them contributes\nhowever much they can, entirely voluntarily every week. They balance\ntheir degree with working for felix, and\na lot of the time the two things become\nequal priority. However, as enthusiastic as people can get, I have always said\nthat your degree should always come\nfirst. Hence, I understand when people can\u2019t commit to any articles for the\nperiod of their exams or dissertations.\nIt is their entirely choice though, and\nI am always extremely grateful to see\ndifferent individuals walk through the\ndoor into the office. I\u2019m equally excited\nto see familiar faces enter as I am new\nones. If you find yourself thinking you\nwant to write for felix, I think I\u2019ve made\nit very clear you\u2019re welcome to see us in\nthe office for a chat and a pint. Alternatively, just email us your thoughts at\nthe moderately simple address felix@\nimperial.ac.uk.\nThe people involved in felix provide\nthe office with a unscientific, stimulating and playful atmosphere that is rare\nat Imperial. The differences in music\ntaste, opinion and perspective bring\nhealthy debate to the surface; especially on Wednesday evenings when\nthe print deadline is looming and the\noffice is packed with writers turning\nin their articles and pages. It is one of\nmany things about being involved with\nfelix that has been the saving grace of\nImperial College. I nearly quit Imperial\nin my first year, disillusioned with my\ncourse and what I was actually trying to\nachieve at this university. When I think\nback to the moment I had my phone in\nmy hand, and the number to Imperial\nCollege Registry dialled; then compare it to the moment I became felix\nEditor, I can only thank everyone who\npersuaded me to stay at Imperial to\nstick it out, and to get a grip on actually\nachieving something. And that is why\nfelix means so much to me, and why\nI am striving to make this year\u2019s felix\nthe best ever. I can only hope felix becomes something that means as much\nto you as it now means to me.\nIt\u2019s really your paper after all.\n\n"

I\u2019m sitting at his\ndesk as he paces up and down the tiny\nspace between his filing cabinet and\nthe desk of the lecturer he shares the\noffice with; thankfully he\u2019s out, I can\u2019t\nimagine that three people would fit in\nthe room.\nDavid\u2019s upset, he\u2019s gesturing wildly\nas he huffs and puffs, pausing only to\nblurt out expletives about this year\u2019s\ncrop of freshers, \u201cBastards!\u201d and \u201cTedious and bloody boring, all of them!\nGod!\u201d.\nHe finally sits down and I ask him\nwhy he believes that this year\u2019s freshers\nare substantially inferior to any previous years.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened, but\nthe difference is obvious, anyone who\u2019s\nbeen on Facebook all summer looking\nat the fresher\u2019s groups could tell you.\nThey\u2019re so bloody unfriendly, I mes-saged one girl asking her \u201cWhere she\ngot a body like that\u201d and she reported\nme to Facebook. Times have changed,\nthey\u2019re so damn uptight!\u201d\nHe gets a call and goes outside into\nthe corridor. While he\u2019s gone I sneak-a-peek on his facebook profile, he\u2019s\nlisted as attending the Mingle, I decide\nto press him on this when he returns. I\nlook at his inbox, there are several messages from freshers, some kind, some\nconfused, one telling him that she \u201cgot\na body like that from her mother who\u2019s\na judge, so back off\u201d.\nDavid returns to the room and I\nquickly jump back to my chair, he\nseems much happier now.\n\u201cGreat news!\u201d he beams, \u201cI just spoke\nto my friend, a sub-warden in Beit, and\nhe\u2019s got me a free ticket to the Mingle\u201d\nHe tells me that he\u2019s been every year\nsince he was a fresher, this year will\nbe the 6th time that he\u2019s been to the\nMingle. \u201cOh yeah, it\u2019s great, everyone\u2019s\nreally nervous and worried about making friends so it\u2019s really easy to be really\nconfident and talk to really hot girls\nbecause they\u2019re just glad to be talking\nto someone. It\u2019s like a funeral really\u201d\nIt\u2019s seems strange to me that he\u2019s\nso excited about going to the Mingle\nwhen he\u2019s quite harsh about the fresh-ers who are going to be there, I ask him\nabout this.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, you\u2019re right, but man\ncompared to the Mingle when I was a\nfresher, it\u2019s been shit every year. In my\nyear I got with like 6 girls but they\u2019ve\nbeen getting more and more uptight\never since, last year I only snogged\none girl and she\u2019d had about twelve\nsnakebites so it didn\u2019t really count\u201d\nbut don\u2019t worry he reassures me, \u201cThis\nPhD student hits out against people that he hasn\u2019t met yet\nyear I have a plan\u201d. His eyes gleam as he\nreaches into his desk drawer and pulls\nout a small bag of powder. He places it\nin front of me triumphantly, I look at\nhim aghast, \u201cIs that, is that a date-rape\ndrug?\u201d\n\u201cWhat! No man! It\u2019s fucking coke,\nI\u2019m going to score at the mingle with\nthis stuff man, seriously I\u2019m always so\ninteresting when I\u2019m coked up, I\u2019m the\nlife of the fucking party, these freshers\nmight be lame, but if they put out then\nmaybe I\u2019ll forgive them.\u201d\nDavid died later that same day in a\nmotorcycle accident... meh.\nHangman\u2019s\nGardening Tips\nW\nith all the hustle and\nbustle of moving in to\nyour newly acquired\naccommodation, you\nhave more than likely forgotten to\ntend to your allotment. Imperial College gives you a great space of land in\nthe centre of Knightsbridge to grow\nyour own vegetables and fruits and if\nyou neglect your personal garden it\nwill end up overgrown with weeds and\nsuch. For those of you who have not\nyet been given you allotment number\nseek advice from the Student Hub located on level 3 Sherfield building.\nThere they will give you your allotment\nnumber, directions and swipe cards to\naccess the private complex.\nComplete beginners need not worry\nabout what to do with their garden, as\nHangman is here to teach the ways of\nninja cultivation. The first thing you\nneed is an array of tools. When we\nsay tool we don\u2019t mean the Deputy\nEditor Kadhim Shubber, we mean fully\nfledged instruments of brutal execu-tion. That\u2019s right manly tools! Again\nnot an attribute of Deputy ESditor Kadhim Shubber. In fact we recommend\njust one tool, one manly blister forming tool. Your bear hands. Long fingernails are also a bonus.\nNow your all set to begin planting\nyour crops, so when the spring comes\nyou can harvest the sweet sweet bounty mother nature has provided you.\nHowever like many novice students\nout there you probably have no idea\nwhat to plant. Do you? DO YOU?! I\nthought not. Well Imperial College has\nthat covered too. If you go the level M\nof the Union building situated in Beit\nQuadrangle you\u2019ll meet a man call Ashley Brown. Now Ash, as we like to call\nhim, has organised for Imperial College Union to provide you with seeds\nto sow in you personal paradise. With a\nwide selection ranging from carrots to\nsalvia there is bound to be something\nyou want to plant. We heard from a not\nso reliable source that if you slip him\n\u00a35 under the counter he will provide\nseeds previously only available from\nthe black market.\nEverytime you\nget offended, a\nbaby dies\nEv\nge\nL\nisten, well read, but you\nknow what I mean.

You are\nprobably quite offended.\nBut let me tell you something. I hate\nbeing CCed into emails, if you got\nsomething to say, then say it directly to\nme, you got that?\nIf you send all your angrily worded\nemails directly to hangman.felix@impe-rial.ac.uk then everyone will be much\nhappier. Dan \u201cThe Cunt\u201d Wan, the\nEditor won\u2019t have to read your whiny\nemails and therefore won\u2019t know to\nwhat extent the bullocks that I write on\nthis page destroys his reputation and\nthe reputation of felix but more impor-tantly, I\u2019ll spot the subject heading \u201cI\nCAN\u2019T BELIEVE YOU SAID THAT\u201d\nin my mailbox and delete the message\nwithout reading it, so nobody will know\nhow much you hate me. I don\u2019t know if\nthis will make you happier but I somehow doubt it, also I don\u2019t care.\nNow, this is an anonymously edited page, so you\u2019ll probably think lots\nof crazy thoughts like, \u201cI bet the guys\nwho edit this page are lame and probably can\u2019t get laid\u201d\n.

(Your girlfriend hates\nyou, like everyone hates you - Ed)\nLet me finish by saying this, go to\nTiger Tiger and Onanon and Opal because I don\u2019t want to see ANY of you\nanywhere else in London. They invented shit clubs in Leicester Square so that\nmy friends and I could go out in London\nwithout having to endure the horror of\nyour presence, so please, give Rough\nHill my thanks.\n33%\nPercentage of people at\nImperial College not eligible\nfor a personal allotment.\n33%\nAnonymous Hangman Editor\nAnonymous Hangman Editor\nPercentage Imperial college\nstudent who have breasts and\na vagina.

You have made it into\none of the top universities in the world.\nYou are now part of a highly respected\nresearch institution filled with some\nof the brightest minds in their fields.\nMany new and exciting opportunities\nare spread before your feet and libraries of knowledge are welcoming you\nwith open arms.\nAnd it\u2019s a rainy Monday morning; you\nhave just set foot on campus and are\npreparing yourself for the mental torture of yet another lecture on complex\nalgebra or three hour stint in the lab.\nThe initial thrill of coming to university\ncan seem a long way from here, but\nthat needn\u2019t be the end of what was\nsuch a promising relationship in the\nfirst instance. There are plenty of plac\u2018I, science\u2019 magazine and you\nI, science is Imperial\u2019s termly popular\nscience magazine. It is written and\nproduced entirely by students, mostly\npostgraduates interested in communicating science. Since its successful start\nin 2004, I, science has been nominated\nfor the best student magazine of the\nyear at the prestigious Guardian Student Media Awards three times, winning second place twice.\nThere are only two other student\nscience magazine brands in the UK:\nCambridge\u2019s BlueSci magazine with\nit\u2019s offshoot at Edinburgh \u2013 EuSci (both\nare produced both by students and\nacademic staff, so they not strictly\nspeaking student magazines) and a\nI, science is Imperial\u2019s award-winning student magazine about\npopular science. Get involved now!\nMicoTatalovic Science Reporter\nAttention all writers!\nNathanLey Science Editor\nTraditionally journalism is seen as\nslightly elitist. Whilst this is undoubtedly true at the upper echelons of the\nprofession (check out the backgrounds\nof the commentators of any respectable broadsheet and it hardly appears\nas if there\u2019s some kind of community\noutreach programme going on) it need\nnot apply at student level.\nIn theory university ought to be a\nhotbed of idea generation and creative\nthought, what with with the sheer volume of bursting adolescents wanting\nto get their voice heard.\nSo how about some of you freshers\ntry your hand at a go? We are always\nlooking for contributors and writers to\nnewcomer to UK universities, the international franchise of the American\nTriple Helix magazine for undergradu-ates. So I, science is both a rare phenomenon and an independently produced magazine by Imperial\u2019s students\nfor Imperial\u2019s community. Articles\ninclude news, reviews, opinions, interviews and in-depth features about science at Imperial and beyond. Last year\nwe tackled issues ranging from futuristic vertical farms to the sketchy science\nof porn. Aiming to surprise the readers,\nwe often feature unexpected science-related cover art, for example issue\n11 was read in secrecy as it contained\nx-ray erotic art, while issue 12 saw students going around sniffing their copy\n\u2013 the covers were coated with scratch-and-sniff technology with butter pop-Become a Science Correspondent, Reporter\nor Columnist for felix. Get involved now!\nes, many of which are a mere stone\u2019s\nthrow from campus, where even the\nmost hopeless feeling can be banished\nand your love for your subject revived.\nFor some free, quick lunch-time in-spiration, The Science Museum and\nNatural History Museum are just south\nof Imperial on Exhibition Road. Aside\nfrom the usual array of displays many\nof you will have already encountered\non previous visits, both museums run\nfrequent additional temporary exhibi-tions, details of which may be found\nat http://www.naturalhistorymuseum.\norg.uk/ and http://www.sciencemu-seum.org.uk/.\nIf you\u2019re looking for something a little less ordinary and a little more in-volved, the Dana Centre on Queen\u2019s\nGate is definitely worth a look. With\na fresh, modern outlook on science,\ntheir varied programme of adults-only\ndebates and dialogues are sure to provide even the most disheartened student with a wealth of ideas to keep an\ninterest in the most topical subjects in\nscience.\nUnfortunately, they went on a break\nfrom their events programme over\nthe summer, but the website promises\nthe centre will running again by this\nautumn.\nIf previous events are anything to\ngo by, we can expect stand-up style\ndebunking of science myths and artists using bacteria to create art. In the\nmeantime, there are plenty of online\ndiscussions providing you with an opportunity to get on your soap-box. For\nfurther information visit http://www.\ndanacentre.org.uk/.\nAlternatively, if just the thought of\nventuring off campus is proving too\nmuch, a quick flick through the Imperial College website (www.imperial.\nac.uk) will give you information about\na variety of lectures being held within\nthe confines of college walls. Quite\noften these lectures are advertised\naround the college itself but many require booking in advance, keep your\neyes peeled.\nI,science\nYou can follow I,science on facebook and Twitter!\nKeep up-to-date with science at Imperial, from the students\u2019 point of view.\nFacebook: I, science (media group)\nTwitter: twitter.com/I_Science_mag\nhelp us put together scientific articles\nthat a student body will find generally\ninteresting along with a healthy dose of\nconjecture.\nSo whether you see yourself as the\nnext aspiring Dan Wan or just as a shy\nand retiring mouse in the corner with\nsomething to air, then please, get in\ncontact with us at science.felix@impe-rial.ac.uk.\ncorn aroma.\nIn 2008/2009 I, science got its own\nFacebook (I, science) and Twitter\ngroups (www.twitter.com/I_science_\nmag). The next step is to modernise its\nwebsite to embrace the web 2.0, so any\nstudents wishing to help us improve\nthe website so it can publish news,\nblogs, podcasts and film, let us know at\ni.science@imperial.ac.uk.\nThe website is the main way the\nmagazine adds to the College\u2019s outreach efforts by providing exciting and\naccurate information about science to\nanyone with access to the internet.\nWe are always looking for keen students to write, edit and design the\nmagazine. So if you want a first step\ninto science journalism, we\u2019re waiting\nfor you.\nBrigetteAtkins Science Editor\nFast relief for when you have those \u2018Why bother?\u2019 moments/days\nWhether it\u2019s refreshing your passion\nfor your subject or just some form of\nredemption after a few heavy nights\nout, these are only a few examples of\nwhat can be found out there to reignite\nthat initial spark between you and the\nscience which brought you here in the\nfirst place.\nNot your average AA meeting: the Dana Centre Cafe hosts many topical debates\n\n"

Good news though - as a gamer,\nyou\u2019ve got an instant method of es-cape. Here\u2019s your first seven days in\nLondon in gaming form, and they\u2019re\nall either free to try or completely\nbloody free, thus allowing you to begin your journey into studenthood\non the cheap. Get used to it.\nBy the time this week\u2019s over you\u2019ll\nbe settled in and kicking back as if\nyou\u2019ve been here for years. Until\nthen, assume the foetal position and\nread on.\nRemember to go out at some point\nthough, obviously.\nDON\u2019T PANIC. Sure, you\u2019re in the middle of nowhere, you don\u2019t know anyone, your dad dropped your PC\ncarrying it up the stairs and you can\u2019t remember how to cook toast. But you\u2019ll always have games.\nSaturday\nOH MY CHRIST YOU\u2019RE A UNIVERSITY STUDENT. Okay. Okay,\ndon\u2019t panic. Must calm down.\nMustn\u2019t overreact. How about a nice,\nrelaxing game of Bejewelled. Ahh.\nThat\u2019s what you want. Download the\nfree demo off of Steam, fire up the\n\u2018Endless\u2019 mode where you can\u2019t fail,\nand start matching gems. Swap adjacent gems on the grid to create lines\nof three, and they fizz and disappear,\nwhilst all the time playing a sooth-ing, new-age-y soundtrack. It\u2019s the\ngaming equivalent of a shiatsu mas-sage, except it\u2019s addictive as hell, so\nperhaps not wholly recommended\nfor the first day.\nSunday\nOH MY GOD YOU\u2019RE STILL\nHERE. Yes, it wasn\u2019t a dream. Your\nhalls will probably be trying to drag\nyou all over the city today, but you\u2019ll\neventually find some time to have a\nsit down, so why not celebrate exploring a new city by taking a look\nat the charming and humourous\nSpelunky. It\u2019s a tomb raiding game,\nwith randomly-generated levels and\na whole bunch of perfect Indiana\nJones bits like golden statues, boulder traps, whips and dames.\nSo, so much fun, so do persevere\npast your first few insta-deaths and\nyou\u2019ll find it a great distraction from\nany latent homesickness, as well as\nthe desire to dress up like Han Solo.\nMonday\nWelcome to the first proper week-day. This might be your day off, so\nyou\u2019ll want to get out a bit. Since\nwe\u2019re on the subject - the nearest\nGame store is on High Street Kensington (two stops along the Circle\nline from South Kensington Tube),\nand while you\u2019re out you can catch\nsome of the local scenery. If you find\nyourself with nothing to do though,\nwhy not sink your teeth into N. N is\na beautifully crisp platformer that\nmade it big on the XBox last year, but\nis available for free on the PC. You\nplay a gold-grabbing ninja across\nfive hundred extremely challenging\nlevels. It\u2019s polished, huge and very,\nvery playable for the first day.\nTuesday\nIt\u2019s Fresher\u2019s Fair! Other than signing\nup to Felix, on account of how inspiring and leaderly the Games editors\nare, you might also drop by the Computer Games Society. They organise\noccasional LAN parties and pretty\nregular gaming sessions where they\nhijack a lecture theatre and project\nGuitar Hero and Halo 3 onto big\nscreens. It\u2019s good times.\nYou\u2019ll be knackered by the time you\nget back, so just take a quick look at\nDroplitz.\nIt\u2019s a fast and simple platformer with\nsome sickeningly addictive game\nmodes that put you in a kind of eerie\nzen-like state. Bing! You\u2019re relaxed.\nJob done.\nWednesday\nFor most of you, lectures will be\nlooming. If you\u2019re still feeling a bit\ngroggy from months and months of\nsod all, check out Make It Good, an\nutterly brilliant text adventure that\u2019ll\nkickstart the brain cells. You play a\nclassic private detective, sent to investigate the murder of an account-ant. But the design of the adventure\nis such that you really do get to be\na detective - you can send evidence\nback for analysis, you can deceive\nwitnesses to get more information,\nand yet it never feels like you\u2019re\nplaying a basic puzzle game. It really\ndoes have that mystery book feel. If\nyou\u2019ve got an hour to spare, sink into\nthis.\nThursday\nCongratulations! If you\u2019ve started\nlectures today then you\u2019re officially a\nscientist. How does it feel? Sciencey?\nTo commemorate this, revisit the\nonline hit of 2009, Fantastic Contraption. It\u2019s a puzzle game with a\nnatty physics engine that asks you\nto construct elaborate inventions to\ntransport a pink dot to the goal.

    "content": "9\nfelix FRIDAY 02 OCTOBER 2009\nCLUBS &\nSOCIETIES\nClubs & Socs Editor Alice Rowlands\nclubs&socs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nx\nThis could be you climbing the peaks of Sweden. Or not. I prefer Finland.\nTo ram the point home\nI\nn case you haven\u2019t heard, we\nhave around 300 Clubs & Societies here at Imperial, and we\nare pretty proud of them. Freshers\u2019 Fair is a day dedicated to\nshowcasing all of them. Check out the\ncentrefold for a full run down of what\nwe have and where all the stalls will be\nlocated, and definitely turn up to it on\nTuesday 6th October. In the Freshers\u2019\nHandbook there is also the Clubs &\nSocieties A-Z with a blurb about each\nof them.\nJust because we\u2019re all here to do sci-ence, engineering or medicine doesn\u2019t\nmean we can\u2019t have fun on the side. If\nyour subject does happen to be your\nextracurricular passion however, you\nare automatically a member of your\ndepartmental society, so it\u2019s worth\nkeeping an eye out on what they have\non offer. Below is a whirlwind tour of\nlots of the things that you can indulge\nyourself in whilst at Imperial. But, if its\nnot just your own life you are looking\nto enrich, you should be sure to catch\nup with RAG (Raising and Giving) the\ncharity fundraising group, and CAG\n(Community Action Group) who do\ngreat things for other communities\nboth locally and further afield.\nSport. I know this one is a little con-troversial. Some of you will be die-hard\nsports men/women, some casual partakers and some of you may think you\nhave been well and truly put off sport\nfor life. One thing to know is that no\nmatter your feelings, we\u2019ve got sport\nin many different flavours, at any level.\nFor those of you in the first category,\nyou won\u2019t need much convincing. The\nonly thing I\u2019ll add is that its worth finding the Sport Imperial stall to find out\nabout our sport scholarships and sport\ndevelopment schemes if you are more\nthan a bit good. For those of you in the\nsecond and third category, I want to\ntake this opportunity to say welcome\nto University: where sport is more\nthan compulsory rugby, football, net-ball, hockey and athletics. For a start,\nthe College gym, Ethos, is free for all\nstudents for swimming and using the\ngym, and just requires a short orientation to get started. And if that\u2019s not\nyour style, then there are a plethora of\nclubs that involve being active in some\nway- many of whom operate at the\nweekend and outside of London. Find\nsomething to keep you active and out\nof the library because a healthy body\nmakes for a healthy mind. Again, people often categorise themselves as arty\nor not, but please don\u2019t. The great thing\nis that you can take as much as you\nwant, with something artistic going\non every day of the week around cam-pus. If it\u2019s playing music that you are\ninto, then there are a wealth of groups\nor practice rooms for individuals and\nsmall ensembles. If you are more into\nphotography or a budding Da Vinci,\nwe have something for you too. And\neven after all that, if you can still only\nsqueak or squeal on instruments and\nTracy Emin\u2019s \u2018My Bed\u2019 is about all you\ncould muster for art, you could always\ngo along to the concerts, exhibits and\nshows that the more artistically minded have put together. These are less\nexpensive than the West End, on your\nDeputy President (Clubs & Societies) Jenny Wilson welcomes\nyou to her wonderous extracurricular oasis of Clubs & Societies\ndoorstep and always a treat. For a full\nlisting of the artistic scene you should\ncheck out the Arts Imperial What\u2019s On\nleaflet. Another way to get your creative juices flowing is to join one of our\nstudent media groups, after all, the reporting is done for the students by the\nstudents.\nInternationally Imperial does very\nwell, welcoming everyone from any-where, of any faith. We have a cornucopia of international and faith societies representing many of those found\non campus, which regularly celebrate\nour diversity. But even if you are from\njust around the corner, its well worth\ngetting immersed in another culture as\nit never fails to be a fascinating experi-ence. If there is still nothing that you\ncan see which tickles your fancy, we\nhave a number of clubs that don\u2019t fit\ninto any of those areas, from knitting to\nvintage vehicles, juggling to chess and\nbackgammon and its well worth opening your mind to all that university can\noffer because then it will truly be one of\nthe best experiences of your life.\nComing up in the next edition:\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on...\u201d is the weekly calendar of upcoming Club & Societies events. This is the place to go to for all the weekly news on up and coming Clubs & Societies events - lots of\nthem will be free, most of them will be cheap and all of them will be fun!\nFor all of you people who run Clubs & Societies, this is a great way to publicise your main events in Felix. What\u2019s On will cover events running from the Monday-Sunday after the relevant edition of Felix. Its first\nappearance will be in the 9th October edition of Felix and will cover events from Monday 12th December - Sunday 18th December.\nTo feature, send the following details to whatson.felix@imperial.ac.uk:\nClub name, Event name, High res logo and photo, Date(s) & Time, Place, Price (if applicable), Short description of the event (max. 50 words)\nDeadline for submissions is midnight on the Wednesday before the edition is published, i.e. to feature in the first edition on Fri 9th December, the submission deadline is midnight on Wednesday 7th October.\nThere is limited space, so all entries are subject to editorial snipping and we cannot guarantee that everybody who sends an email will feature.\nWhat\u2019s on...\nClubs & Societies Calendar\nEd Brightman sings the praises of the\nA-Cappella scene at Imperial College\nNot just for choir girls\nS\ninging at Imperial isn\u2019t just\nabout the big choir anymore.\nNeither does it have to be the\nsame old classical repertoire.\nThere is an alternative, which\nis growing in popularity like Pokemon\ndid in the \u201800s. \u201cA Cappella\u201d singing,\nwhich started with barbershop groups\nand glee clubs in the US, is no longer\nall waistcoats, boaters and songs about\nyour daughter.\nIn recent decades groups have\nevolved into all-beat-boxing, vocal\nrock bands, singing original multi-part\nvocal arrangements of everything from\nthe Kinks to Kanye West. Meanwhile,\nover here in the UK, we\u2019ve had the\nKing\u2019s Singers, the jazzy Swingle Singers and, more recently, the Puppini Sisters. University a cappella groups are\ncropping up all over the country, and\nImperial now boasts a good few of its\nown.\nImperial\u2019s newest group, the Techtonics, just started singing last year\nand have been going from strength to\nstrength. There is something unique\nabout the sound of an all male-voice\ngroup, and the Techtonics bring a\nvibrant new sound to rock and pop\nfavourites like Feeder and tongue-in-cheek comedy like Flight of the Conchords. They are looking for new singers this term, so if you like the sound\nof this, get in touch to arrange an audition (don\u2019t worry it\u2019s pain-free) at tech-tonics@imperial.ac.uk.\nI can promise you the experience of\nsinging in a group like the Techtonics\nis awesome. Nowhere else can you get\nthe opportunity to travel the world,\nrecord an album, get into amazing parties for free, and sing like a rock legend,\nunless you happen to play in a band\nalready.\nAt the other end of the spectrum is\na mixed group of about 8-10 singers,\nsinging jazz and pop arrangements,\ncalled the Harmaphrodites, who have\nbeen performing under the direction\nof Jess Gillingwater for several years\nnow. They regularly sing at events in\ncollege and their refined sound is always a hit at concerts.\nOn a slightly larger scale, the Chamber Choir also perform a cappella arrangements of songs from the charts,\nas well as some more traditional choral\nworks, for those of you with an affinity\nfor the choir vibe.\nLook out for them at the Choir section of Freshers\u2019 Fair, or email jcg04@\nimperial.ac.uk.\nOf course, if you\u2019re not interested\nin singing (in which case, why are you\nstill reading this?!) then you should\ndefinitely come along and listen to the\nconcerts, it\u2019s a perfect way to spend an\nevening.\nIf you\u2019re still not convinced, there are\nsound clips on the Techtonics\u2019 website,\nwww.thetechtonics.co.uk, and you\u2019re\nlikely to see them busking somewhere\nin college this week.\nImperial\u2019s newest A Cappella group, The Techtonics, contemplating suicide.\n\n"

    "content": "6 felix FRIDAY 02 OCTOBER 2009\nA cookbook for one........\nOne thing that instils fear into the heart of students leaving home for the first time is the supposedly mammoth\ntask of keeping themselves fed and watered whilst staying on top of their workload and social life. The reality is,\noften students are too busy, too scared or just too cash-strapped to want to put a lot of effort into cooking.\nReady meals and pizzas tend up being costlier and pretty unhealthy due to their high salt and preservative\ncontent. After a few weeks however, you quickly learn to adapt and many students go on to really enjoy cooking.\nIn addition, as you make more friends there will be lots of opportunities for pairing up with other people to\nshare the workload. These \u2018recipes\u2019 are just ideas for grabbing a quick bite that won\u2019t break the bank, and will\nmean you\u2019re less tempted to grab a pricey snack or fatty chips when your stomach starts rumbling. They\u2019re not\nparticularly inspiring, but then again nobody should be scared by their complexity.\nThis isn\u2019t going to win in the gastronomic stakes, but it\u2019s cheap and ready in a flash. It\u2019s also a good\noption when your fridge is empty. The pasta in tinned minestrone soup turns mushy when you cook\nit, and this method makes a much heartier meal.\nTime: 15 minutes\nCost: 70p per portion\nIngredients: \u2022 1 can of your favourite soup (mushroom or tomato work well)\n\u2022 Handful of dried pasta such as farfalle or macaroni\nMethod: Heat the soup gently in a saucepan. When it is warmed through, add the pasta and\ncook for the amount of time stated on the packet. If there are any leftovers, store them in a mug in the fridge for no\nlonger than a day and heat up in a microwave or saucepan for a quick snack.\nAnother one that\u2019s not going to win any prizes, but it works in terms of getting you much-needed protein\nwhen you\u2019re in a hurry. If you stick some lettuce, tomato or cucumber in between slices you\u2019re getting\nsome of your five-a-day too.\nTime: 10 minutes\nCost: 50p per sandwich\nIngredients: \u2022 Frozen fish fingers\n\u2022 Bread\n\u2022 Ketchup or mayonnaise\n\u2022 Salad (optional!)\nMethod: Cook the fish fingers according to the instructions on the packet. Stick in between 2 slices of bread with a\ngood splodge of mayonnaise or ketchup and some salad if using.\nOK. Healthy and a substantial meal that keeps well in the fridge for a day or so in a Tupperware. It\u2019s also particularly handy for lunch the\nfollowing day to avoid splashing out on a pricier meal in college.\nTime: 15 minutes\nCost: \u00a31.50 (enough for 2 meals)\nIngredients: \u2022 2-3 handfuls of dried pasta (shell-shaped pasta works well)\n\u2022 Tin of tuna in water or oil\n\u2022 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise\n\u2022 Salt and pepper to taste\n\u2022 Squeeze of lemon juice (optional)\n\u2022 Half a small tin of sweetcorn (optional)\nMethod: Bring a large saucepan of water to boil (boiling it in a kettle is faster) and put in a\npinch of salt. Add the pasta and cook according to the time on the packet. In the meantime, mix\nthe tin of tuna with the mayonnaise, a small pinch of pepper and the lemon juice and sweetcorn if\nusing (diced fresh peppers also work well).\nSubstitute minestrone soup\nFish Finger Sandwich\nTuna Pasta Salad\n\n"

Finishg 3rd place in\nBUCS division 1A, finishing behind\nBrunel and Middlesex (two sports-intensive universities) is not bad an\nachievement. The highlight of the their\nyear was winning the BUCS Trophy in\nSheffield, beating York 9-7.\nWhereas the ICSM (Medicals) netball teams have been performing extremely well, the IC ladies have had,\nto put it simply, a diabolical season.\nTheir 1st team didn\u2019t win a match and\nas a club they came bottom of our very\nown table. So calling all college ladies,\nif you play netball, do not be put off,\nthe team can only improve. In fact it\nwill be more of an effort to do worse\nthan last year!\nFor the last two years the Imperial\nSquash Club have been performing to\na very high standard, with the men\u2019s 1st\nteam winning promotion for two years\non the trot. Do not be afraid of this,\nhowever, as the club is open to anyone\nan they cater to all levels of ability.\nAs you can see, there are a lot of\nsports on offer apart from the big\nthree; hockey, football and rugby. But\nhow did they all do last year? Looking\nat the league table, Imperial hockey\nMen\u2019s 1st team are the only ones that\nmade it into the top ten (just to let you\nknow, there are 60 teams in total that\nparticipate in the league). In stark con-trast, the bottom ten had five teams\nfrom the \u2018big three\u2019. It is safe to say\nthat the clubs are looking to improve\ntheir performance this season, and of\ncourse, they do cater for the experienced and novice players alike.\nOne other thing that you should\nprobably realise sooner rather than\nlater is that there is a fair bit of rivalry,\nmainly between the Medics and College teams. This rivalry culminates in\nthe annual Varsity sporting event in\nlate February with the spectacle being the rugby men\u2019s 1st teams battling\nit out at Richmond Athletics Club in\nfront of a crowd of roughly 1,500 students and staff.\nEach year the event gets bigger and\nbetter, and the afterparty is one of the\nhighlights of the year, so make sure\nyou keep 17th March 2010 free and\ncome along for some banter and a fun\nevening. There will even be the now\nannual \u2018The Rival\u2019 magazine published\nsoon after Varsity, giving you a comprehensive round up of all the results.\nOh and if there are any rowers out\nthere, I\u2019m not sure how to put this to\nyou, but we\u2019re good... Really good.\nWorld class in fact. But just like all the\nother sports, they cater for the novices,\nso if it tickles your fancy, give it a go.\nFinally, apart from remembering\nto bring your kit with you to the first\nweek, you must also remember to set\na side some money to actually join the\nclubs. Membership can be bought online at www.imperialcollegeunion.org/\nclubs-and-societies so make sure you\npay the membership now before you\nspend it all in the bar.\nWhatever club you join, you\u2019re\nbound to find a great bunch of people\nand your time will be better spent at\nImperial. So get stuck in and look out\nfor the ACC bar nights which are going\nto be entertaining.\nThese guys were amazing last year. Who knows, you can replicate such successes this year if you commit to Table Tennis.\nEarn whilst you play - Imperial\u2019s\nDeveloping Excellence Scheme\nAre you a full time student at Imperial\nCollege as well as a committed sport-sperson, a dedicated athlete, an elite\nathlete or part of a club that is performing to a high standard?

You\u2019ve\nmade it to Imperial, a\nplace where technology and life should be\nas one. I\u2019ll leave that up to you to de-cide, but here\u2019s a quick guide to tech at\ncollege and out and about in London\nto see you through your first couple of\nweeks.\nThere are plenty of computers scattered around Imperial. Armed with\nyour IC login, you have full unadulterated access to the internet. Be warned\nthat there is a usage policy and ICT is\nwatching, as those of us who have fallen foul in the past can attest.\nSo where can you get at a computer?\nWell the Library has quite a few, from\nthe ground floor Caf\u00e9 to the individual\ntopic floors with books (remember\nthem right?). There are also a few scattered outside the SCR and most departments around college have at least\none dedicated computer suite. Rumor\nhas it that some departments are better\nendowed than others (here\u2019s looking at\nyou Mech Eng), so if you find yourself\nshort in one department check out\nyour neighboring departments.\nOf course if you\u2019re the roll your own\ntype, brandishing your nice and shiny\npride and joy, Imperial has a campus\nwide wireless network. Imperial-WPA\nis the preferred connection and can\nbe logged onto with pretty much any\nmodern device, including iPhones/\nGphones, with your Imperial login\ndetails. Some halls are kitted out for\nWiFi, but many still rely on Ethernet\nconnection in rooms, which are also a\ngreat deal faster.\nWhilst using a non-college computer\nyou can still get access to your Home\nor H drive by using the Home directory finder (on the Imperial ICT web-site) and following the instructions.\nYour email account can also be accessed using Exchange, IMAP or POP\ndepending on what your needs are.\nSnow Leopard users will be pleased\nto hear that Imperial runs Exchange\n2007 meaning all your Mac apps work\nbrilliantly with your college account.\nWindows users will need Outlook for\nfull interoperability with calendar, contacts and email. If you\u2019re out and about,\nyour email can also be got at through\nthe Outlook Web Access (http://icex.\nimperial.ac.uk) in any browser, though\nto get the non \u2018light\u2019 version you\u2019ll need\nInternet Explorer *sigh*.\nThis week, Technology Editor Samuel Gibbs, brings you a quick\nand dirty rundown of the ins and outs of tech life at Imperial\nSpeaking of Halls, tech doesn\u2019t stop\nat the door. Many Halls are kitted out\nwith LCDs, games consoles, DVD/BluRay players and shared computers. If\nyou\u2019ve got your own TV with you (you\ncrazy kids) don\u2019t forget you\u2019ll \u2018need\u2019 a\nTV license, even for those with PC TV\nEveryone needs music at some point\nduring their studies, whether it\u2019s for\nworking or rocking a party. These days\nmusic is available everywhere, some\nof it legally, quite a lot of it not. So if\nyou\u2019re sick of your music collection or\nonly or you only brought a couple of\nCDs with you, why not check out Spotify for your free and legal music hit.\nIf you\u2019ve had been living under a\nrock for the last year and don\u2019t have\nthe foggiest what I\u2019m on about then\nhead on over to spotify.com and grab\nthe client. The service provides unlimited streaming of a large music library\nwith artists from EMI, Sony, Univeral,\nWarner and some other smaller la-bels. There\u2019s the odd advert between\nsongs here and there and there are ads\ndisplayed in the program itself but if\nyou\u2019re after music on the cheap you\ncan\u2019t get much better. Unfortunately\nSpotify has just gone invitation only\nfor the time being, it should go back to\ngeneral subscription in the future, but\nyou can stick your email in there for in-vites. Spotify also runs a subscription\nbased model at \u00a39.99 a month with a\n\u00a30.99 24-hour day pass for trial pur-poses, which is still open for sign-ups if\nyou\u2019re keen on the idea or want Spotify\non your iPhone or Android device.\nAnother decent free and legal music\nservice is the selective internet radio\nprovided by Last.fm. Listeners select a\ntrack or artist and start a \u2018radio station\u2019\nbased around the type of music the\ntrack or artist represents. If you just\nwant to listen to some music and not\nspecific tracks then Last.fm is great.\nThe service also uses a recommendation engine, which learns by \u2018Scrobbling\u2019 the music you listen to into a database of likes and dislikes, to predict\ntracks you\u2019d like and recommend new\nartists and concerts. A player can be\ndownloaded from Last.fm or streamed\nstraight off the website.\ntuner cards.\nImperial, especially South Ken, is a\npretty benign place overall but there\nare a few things to be aware of now\nthat you\u2019re here. A decent firewall and\nantivirus is a must if you\u2019re a PC user.\nIf you\u2019re connected to the college network literally thousands of people can,\nwith a bit of know-how, find and have a\ngo at your computer, so make sure you\nuse protection. After all, you wouldn\u2019t\nwant to go home to your Mum with a\nnasty infection now would you? Mac\nusers make sure you have your firewall\non, by default it\u2019s off, because people\ncan still steal your stuff. Backups, you\nprobably hear this a lot, are the savior\nof many a poor soul. From hardware\nfailures, accidents, thieves and mal-ware, there are lots of things that could\nhappen to your data. Irreplaceable\nphotos of your roommate slumped in\nthe corner with marker pen all over his\nface, as well as coursework, needn\u2019t be\nlost should you have a good backup.\nPhysical protection for your gear is\nalso important. It doesn\u2019t happen very\noften, but being a public place, nefarious types can get into Halls and raid\nrooms. It happened several times when\nI was a whippersnapper like yourselves\nand those who weren\u2019t insured paid\ndearly. Insurance for your possessions\nin halls can be difficult to find from\nnon-student insurers, but the likes\nof Endsleigh specialize in insurance\ngeared up for Halls and at reasonable\nrates too. You might also be able to get\ncover specified on your parents household insurance for a nominal fee, so get\nthem to check with their provider. Stolen gear doesn\u2019t always have to mean a\nwrecked week, if you\u2019re covered.\nOf course you\u2019re not just here in\nLondon to study, so your tech life\nshould follow you out and about in the\ncapital. Thankfully the networks have\ngotten off their backsides and provide\npretty good 3G signal across London\nfor those equipped with smartphones,\nmodems and portable hotspots. For\nthose seeking a bit of WiFi, London\njust so happens to be one of the most\nconnected cities on the planet with almost every coffee shop on every corner offering WiFi.\nQuite a few BT phone boxes and\neven some lampposts about the city\nare also hotspots so the likelihood is\nthat you\u2019ll be able to get your hit from\nalmost anywhere. Most hotspots are\nrun by BT, T-mobile, the Cloud and\nO2, but having an account with one\nof them normally means you can log\ninto others using a cross network login\nsystem.\nFrom experience I know this doesn\u2019t\nalways work, but when it does, it\u2019s\ngreat.\nYou can even get programs such as\nDeviceScape that deal with the hassle\nof logging in for you automatically.\nIn College\nIn Halls Music\nOut and About in London Where to buy Tech\nUseful Links\nwww.imperial.ac.uk/ict\nicex.imperial.ac.uk\nwww.endsleigh.co.uk\nwww.spotify.com\nwww.Last.fm\nwww.ebuyer.com\nwww.TFL.gov.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nIf you\u2019re feeling a bit short of gadgets then London also boasts quite a\nfew shops to cater for your inner tech.\nThe \u2018world famous\u2019 Tottenham Court\nRoad plays host to quite a few compu-ter, gadget and consumer electronics\nshops including Micro Anvika, Gultronics and Brains HiFi, which sells,\nyou guessed it, HiFi equipment. Tottenham Court Road has 3 tube stations\nalong it, Tottenham Court Road (Cen-tral line), Goodge Street (Northern\nline) and Warren Street (Northern and\nVictoria lines) so it\u2019s easy to get there\nand back with your goods. London also\nplays host to two Apple stores, Regent\nStreet and Westfield, should you be a\nMac-o-phile. There\u2019s even a PC World,\nif you absolutely must, located close to\ncollege on High Street Ken.\nOf course being tech savvy as you all\nof course are, online is probably your\nbest bet if you\u2019re prepared to wait.\nEbuyer.com is always a good bet, dabs.\ncom is also worth a check. If you\u2019re after\nsome more unusual portable tech then\nExpansys.com, which specialises in unlocked phones, imported gadgets and a\nvariety of accessories to kit you out.\nother interesting developments.\nThe now Apple-less MacWorld 2010\n(will Apple have their own event in Q4/\nQ1 2010?) takes place 3-13th February\nin San Francisco. If new accessories are\nyour thing then this year shouldn\u2019t dis-appoint. For the rest of us MacWorld\nminus Apple is a bit like a burger without the meat.\nCeBIT 2010 held between 2-6th\nMarch in Hanover, Germany, is a prime\nshowcase for a lot of portable comput-ing. Look out for new netbooks, PNDs,\ncomputer parts and accessories. Also\nkeep an eye out for a boat load of patent infringement arrests if this year\nwas anything to go by.\nApple holds it\u2019s own events throughout the year, because they\u2019re, you know,\n\u2018special\u2019. So expect some sort of new\nannouncements in Q2 around May/\nJune, with WWDC 2010 (World Wide\nDevelopers Conference). The recently\nheld annual Q3 music event, \u2018It\u2019s just\nRock and Roll\u2019, brought updates across\nthe iPod line including a camera wielding iPod nano. The iPod touch got very\nlittle love from Apple, rumours of camera module issues abound, so expect\nsome sort of iPod touch announcement in the near future.\nOf course if there\u2019s something specific you want covered, got a tip or\nsuggestion, or just want to complain,\nhit us up at: technology.felix@impe-rial.ac.uk or follow us at twitter.com/\nSamuelGibbs\nSoon we\u2019ll have\nembedded\nvideo, promise\n\n"

    "content": "5\nfelix FRIDAY 02 OCTOBER 2009\nCOMMENT\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nI\n\u2019m going to be honest and say\nthat I started off Freshers with a\nlot of apprehension. After shedding a few tears and seeing my\nbeloved family drive into the\ndistance, I dragged my way to the solid\nBeit hall feeling more than nervous. I\nthought that I wasn\u2019t clever enough to\nfit in with the stereotypical Imperial\nnerds. I\u2019d chosen to study Physics on a\nwhim and I hadn\u2019t even finished reading A Brief History of Time! But I was\ndefinitely no party animal either. I\u2019d\nnever been to a club, or had much experience of drinking (it suffices to say\nin the coming weeks I made up for lost\ntime, and then some).\nBut it turns out that my fears were\nunwarranted. I clearly wasn\u2019t the only\nfrightened person at the Mingle, with\nmany others looking awkward and\nasking the tedious questions, \u201cso what\nsubject are you studying? What A levels did you do?...\u201d\nAnd in my case, the Fresher\u2019s Week\nevents weren\u2019t the best way to meet\npeople anyway. I found the communal\nkitchen, with its unique - albeit slightly\nscientific - banter and daily soap operas a far better place for this. I will\nwarn you now that you should guard\nyour cutlery, pots, pans and food with\nyour life.\nI found people that I\ngot along with, and soon\nenough I was making the\nweekly right of passage\n(that is envied by no one\nwith a decent taste in\nmusic): Tiger Tiger on\nMonday, Sway on Tuesday, Cheapskates on\nWednesday, On Anon\n(and on, and on, and\non) on Thursday, garnished with many a\ndiabolical night at\nthe Union. I look\nback and marvel\nat how I was able\nto make it to 9am\nlectures at all, never mind hangover\nfree.\nWhich takes me\nto the academic\nside of things. I\ncame to Imperial\nwith the assumption\nthat a Physics degree\nwouldn\u2019t be too hard.\nAfter all, I\u2019d managed\nA levels OK, and I was\nmost definitely going to\nspend my time studying into the night,\nevery night, and achieve the zenith of\nacademic greatness. Somewhere not\ntoo far along the line, that plan failed.\nWhich isn\u2019t to say I regret it at all;\nFreshers shouldn\u2019t be about spending\nall your time in the library, and cramming still works for first year exams,\nsort of.\nYou\u2019ve probably heard it before, but\nbeing a Fresher is a once in a lifetime\nopportunity. By the time you make second year you\u2019ll be wishing you didn\u2019t\ntake it for granted. And so, my dewy,\nbright-eyed Freshers, enjoy it while\nyou can!\nMelissaLeverlosesherinnocenceatImperial\n\u201cI was making\nthe weekly right\nof passage that is\nenvied by no one\nwith a decent taste\nin music, garnished\nwith many a night\nat the Union\u201d\nI\nfeel like mourning fresherdom.\nLooking back on my Fresher\nyear, the somewhat recent\nmemory feels like looking back\non a lifetime of union events,\nembroiled with snake bites, hazey\nwalks back through Hyde Park and\nstruggling to decipher unfamiliar bus\nmaps. The initial Fresher experience at\nImperial is quite overwhelming. Firstly\nyou have to deal with the interestingly\ninternational and \u201cstudious\u201d complement of personalities in your halls,\nthen later go to some massive student\nclub, dressed in nothing but neon,\nand get hilariously plastered. This is\nall good fun for the first week, which\nluckily is just enough time before lectures start. That\u2019s when it starts to get\nreally tough. Get used to going to lectures at ridiculous o\u2019clock, aimlessly\nfinding your way through what will\nsoon be a noxiously familiar campus.\nThose first few weeks will be physically\nhard. So stock up on vitamins, red bull,\nsoap and tinned food; and with luck\nyou will survive.\nI remember turning up to Ministry\nof Sound and the DJ announcing that\nImperial had arrived, recognising the\nusual male mob of fearful, spectacle-bearing, fresh faces. Hence \u201cImperial\u201d can be used descriptively; if used\nagainst an unfortunate garment you\u2019re\nwearing, you might want to avoid\nwearing it outside the campus gates.\nI would heavily recommend joining\na society. I failed this year, purely due\nto my own preoccupancy with friends,\nliquid intoxicants and learning how to\nget by. There are so many societies at\nImperial, so maybe go in with some\nintent, discipline and an open mind.\nIt\u2019s a sure way to make friends outside\nof the compulsory halls/course circle.\nThe Union nights can be good, as long\nas you go with the right expectations.\nNo doubt you will be aware of the\nHUGELY disproportionate sex ratio,\nwhich does cause quite a lot of animosity between boys and girls. However resentment is the wrong way to\ngo. None of us wanted it is this way.\nIf you\u2019re searching for a girl, don\u2019t\nget disheartened if everything is a bit\ndry. There are many options like joining a society, meeting those on your\ncourse and halls, and perhaps consider\nbranching out of Imperial.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a boy, take your\npick. But don\u2019t forget the infamous Imperial motto: \u201cthe odds are good, but\nthe goods are odd\u201d. Personally I think\nthe odder the better, but this may be a\nmatter of opinion, so see above.\nAcademically you are likely to be\npushed, so prepare by having a LOT of\nfun being a Fresher, but eventually at\nsome far off point in the future you will\nhave to work hard.\nFinally, try to avoid being drawn into\nthe Imperial bubble, remember where\nyou are. Maybe make a mental list of\nthings you want to do, see and hear this\nyear. It\u2019s good to make the most of being in central London, a rare luxury for\na student and is one of Imperial\u2019s many\nperks.\nDespite some of my honest allusions,\nI am strangely jealous. Good luck!\nKatieTomlinsonismourningFresherdom\n\u201cTry to avoid being\ndrawn into the\nImperial bubble,\nremember where\nyou are; make the\nmost of being in\ncentral London. It is\na rare luxury.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s your Comment piece going to be about?\n\u201cGot something on your mind? Need to\ntake issue with with something? Disagree\nwith another Comment piece? Have a\nhilarious story you need to share with the\nrest of College? I bet you do, Freshers.\u201d\nAnyone and everyone can write a Comment piece. It can be\nabout anything and everything.

Needy\nMcNeedy has exactly three\nsolutions, just for you, xoxox\nDear Needy McNeedy,\nI broke up with my boyfriend before\nstarting uni, I didn\u2019t want to be tied\ndown with all this sausage around.\nUnfortunately I didn\u2019t get the blob\nthis month and it turns out that I\u2019m\npregnant, probably by him. Help!\nWhat do I do?\nFat Slag\nDear Fat Slag,\nUhhh contraception? With condoms,\nthe pill and all manner of baby-stop-ping devices available nowadays, you\nmust have about half a brain cell if you\ngot preggers. But now that you\u2019ve got\ninto this mess there are only three possible things that you can do.\nOnly three!\n1. Be a mature human being and tell\nhim immediately, he has a right to\nknow. You should make a decision together about what path you\u2019re going\nto take, whether to keep the baby. You\nshould get your parents involved also\nand remember, if you decide to keep the\nbaby, the uni has a great support structure so don\u2019t be afraid to get in contact\nthem.\n2.Don\u2019t be a mature human being, keep\nthe baby a secret, don\u2019t tell anyone!\nHide the bump by wearing baggy, oversized clothes and then when the baby is\nborn, throw it in a dumpster. That way\nno-one will ever, ever know...\n3.You might not like this one, walk up to\nthe top floor of your halls, stand at the\nedge of the staircase and then get a close\nfriend to push you. It\u2019s either that or a\ngag and a coathanger. It\u2019s 100% safe, I\npromise...\nLove,\nNeedy McNeedy. x\nDear Needy McNeedy,\nMoving to Imperial was a big step\nfor me, but I was always sure that I\nwould be o.k. if I had my pet Gerbil\nBilly with me. But my halls have a no\npets policy, I don\u2019t know if I can live\nwithout Billy, who will I turn to for\nemotional support? Is there anyway\nI can bring him to uni?\nConcerned Gerbil Owner\nDear Concerned Gerbil Owner,\nYou look to your pet gerbil for emotional support? And who the fuck owns a\ngerbil anyway, you\u2019re almost an adult,\ntry getting a girlfriend/boyfriend, or\nbetter yet, a friend full-stop. Or at the\nvery minimum and umaginary friend.\nI think there are bigger problems here\nbut if you must bring Billy, you do have\nsome options.\n1. Gerbils are pretty small, or at least\nthat\u2019s what I remember from when I\nwas 12 years old. It wouldn\u2019t be very\ndifficult to hide a gerbil in your room,\nwhenever the cleaner comes to your\nroom just put the cage under your bed.\nAs long as you make sure it doesn\u2019t escape and kill someone, there won\u2019t be\nany problems.\n2. Buy a pair of dark glasses, a walking\nstick and a leash for your gerbil. All you\nhave to do is pretend to be blind and\nclaim that you own a guide gerbil. If\nanyone calls you out, get really indignant and shout \u201cRACIST!\u201d\n3. Don\u2019t stand for this infringment on\nyour human right to be pathetic! If the\nwardens demand that you get rid of Billy, stab them in the face, there won\u2019t be\nany negative consequences, I promise...\nLove,\nNeedy McNeedy. x\nDear Needy McNeedy,\nI\u2019ve been making loads of friends\nsince I arrived at Imperial, I even\nmet some medics in Hackney at a\nwarehouse party. What a coincidence I thought! I later found out\nthat they\u2019re in the mafia and not at\nImperial at all, they\u2019ve been asking\nme to \u2018work\u2019 for them, I\u2019m pretty\nscared, what do I do?\nNaive and Scared\nDear Naive and Scared,\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever talked to\nanybody at this corporate shithole of a\nuniversity but for the future remember\nthis, nobody at Imperial goes to warehouse parties in Hackney, except maybe Alex Ashford, she just might be cool\nenough. Back to your problem, don\u2019t\nworry; there are three ways out.\n1. Cut off all contact with these people,\nchange your number if neccessary. If\nthey don\u2019t get the message and continue\nto harass you, call the police.\n2. You need to man the fuck up, this is\na golden opportunity to make some serious moulah. Meet up with them and\nrepeat these words, \u201cTell me what to do\nand I\u2019ll do it\u201d. Don\u2019t worry about going\nto hell, it doesn\u2019t exist.\n3. Let\u2019s face it, these people are gangsters and from my vast experience of\nthe criminal underworld, these guys are\nusually arseholes. They\u2019re not going to\nleave you alone, so we\u2019re going to have\nto do something drastic and by \u201cwe\u201d,\nI mean YOU and by \u201cdrastic\u201d I mean\nstab them repeatedly in the face. There\nwon\u2019t be any negative consequences, I\npromise...\nLove,\nNeedy McNeedy. x\n\n"

If you\u2019re\nreading this, you\u2019re\nprobably a Fresher,\nso have successfully\nmade it to Imperial\nCollege. You\u2019ll have overcome revision,\nexams, traffic congestion and parking\nwardens to have made it into halls,\nor braved public\ntransport to commute in. You should\nhave seen the Union\u2019s handbook by\nnow \u2013 if not, drop by reception on\nlevel 2M of the Union building in Beit\nand pick one up. I won\u2019t begin to cover\nthe same topics, as it would start to get\nrepetitive!\nIt\u2019s been good to talk to many of you\non Facebook, especially as one of\nthe conversations provided\ninspiration for\nthis column. I\nwas asked \u201cdo\nyou want to\ngo into politics?\u201d, which\ngot me thinking about\nthe different\nways people\nmight view a\nstudents\u2019 union. Is it a place where you\ngo to socialise? A place which organises recreational activities? Somewhere\nto go for help? A place where people\nstand around with placards shout-ing? Or a breeding ground for people\nto climb the greasy pole of politics?\nA students\u2019 union can be all of those\nthings, but Imperial College Union\ndoes some of those more than others.\nWe\u2019re sometimes seen as fairly odd\n(as a Union, not as people, although\nsome might say otherwise), because we\nspend lots of money on clubs and tend\nnot to go on massive rants about things\nwhich don\u2019t affect our students.\nThe Union is a great place to social-ise without breaking the bank\u2013 our\nbars are open throughout the week\nserving food and drink, and our aim\nis to give you a venue which provides\na good service and value for money.\nWe\u2019ll also be raising money during the\nyear to extensively refurbish our bars,\nand we\u2019ll want your input.\nWe don\u2019t tend to go around waving\nplacards and shouting through mega-phones, or pretending that we\u2019re the\nUnited Nations (we have societies that\ndo that, if you want to). Imperial is\nhome to such a diverse set of people,\nwith so many different opinions, that\nas a Union we try to stay apolitical, but\nhave clubs for different political and\nphilosophical viewpoints. We spend a\nlot of time and money on clubs, which\nprovide for a huge range of activities.\nMake use of the subsidy while you can!\nWe are certainly a place to come for\nhelp. We sit on lots of College committees to represent your views, but also\nhave extensive contacts throughout\nthe College and beyond with which to\ntry and solve any problems you might\nencounter. As a Fresher, these will\nprobably revolve around money, jobs\nand accommodation for a while, before moving on to exam stress and the\nlike. If we don\u2019t know how to help, we\u2019ll\nknow someone who can.\nAll of that was a long way of answering \u201cno, not really\u201d to the \u201cdo you want\nto go into politics?\u201d question. Politics\nfor the sake of politics isn\u2019t the focus\nof what we do. A lot of what we do is\npolitics, of course: negotiating with\nthe College when students want something changed, trying to find a compromise between opposing views etc\netc etc. But our focus is on students,\nso make sure you tell us what you want\nyour Union to do.\n(OK, I might have lied a bit and covered some of the same ground as the\nhandbook. In the first \u2018real\u2019 issue of felix I\u2019ll talk a bit about what we\u2019re planning to do in the coming year, which\ncertainly won\u2019t be like the handbook.\nProbably.)\nAshleyBrownwelcomesyoutotheUnion\n\u201cWe don\u2019t tend to\ngo around waving\nplacards and\nshouting through\nmegaphones or\npretending that\nwe\u2019re the United\nNations\u201d\nI\nf you\u2019re anything like me then\nyou\u2019re Jewish, 6 ft 2\u201d, in desperate need of a shave and are currently struggling to type a 700-word article on somebody else\u2019s\nMacBook. Chances are, of course, that\nyou\u2019re not like me - something which\nI\u2019m sure comes as quite a relief to both\nof us. One thing we do have in com-mon, however, is that we are now both\nstudents at the same university. And\nthat, like it or not, makes you twice as\nlikely to be male as female. This may\nbe something of a surprise to those of\nyou who have never previously had any\nreason to doubt your gender, but I\u2019m\nafraid there\u2019s no arguing with statis-tics. Only one out of every three students is going to be a woman, but seeing as I belong to the sex that grows to\n6 ft 2\u201d and ends up desperately needing\nshaves, the odds have evened themselves out pretty well for you.\nTo be fair, these numbers don\u2019t mean\nvery much. By far the more important\npiece of information is that one in every four of you will come from a land\nbeyond the confines of what we have\ncome to know and love as the European Union. In other words, you are\ncurrently sitting on a bed inside a hall\nof residence belonging to the second\nmost multicultural university in the\ncountry. Unless, of course, you happen to have broken with tradition and\ntaken this copy of felix out beyond the\nconfines of your room, in which case I\nsalute your intrepid spirit.\nThe tremendous variation in nationality - and slightly less tremendous\nvariation in gender - can make life at\nImperial a bit confusing. Which is a little like saying that fish and chips with\npeas can taste a bit like fish and chips.\nYour lives were like skeins of wool in\na lion enclosure long before you came\nto university, and I hope for your sake\nthey remain that way for many years\nafter. It\u2019s fairer to say that the time you\nspend at Imperial will be like a particularly intense game of Monopoly: it\nmay well take you a few years to finish,\nit will cost you a considerable amount\nof money, you will spend endless hours\ngoing over the same, familiar streets,\nand unless you\u2019re very careful you\ncould well end up in jail. More than\nthat, it will prove at one and the same\ntime exciting, excruciating, exhausting\nand exhilarating, and you can win if\nyou know the rules.\nThat has been the point of the threatening reams of paper that have been\nrammed into your mailbox, left in wait\non your bed in halls, and thrust into\nyour terrified hands since you first decided Imperial was a good place to go\nonce Oxbridge had turned you down.\nAnd yet, despite the noble causes that\nthose trees died to promote, may I congratulate you on turning to felix. Well\ndone, and thank you. Thank you, thank\nyou, thank you. For it is here, in this pa-per, that you learn the rules. The forms\nand inventories, insurance claims and\ntelephone bills, classwork and exercises currently covering your bed will\nusually do little more than turn you\ninto a panicking cat\u2019s cradle of nerves.\nNow is the perfect opportunity to take\na break and give yourself some time.\nIf the words \u2018Don\u2019t Panic\u2019 were good\nenough for the Megadodo publishing corporation in the constellation of\nUrsa Minor, and by extension for the\nEarth-author Douglas Adams, then\nthey are certainly good enough for us.\nAs a final note, somewhere in your\nroom you should find a small multi-coloured cardboard box meant to\nserve as a goody bag-cum-survival\nkit. Among other things, this box will\ncontain a single, flavoured, condom.\nRemember its flavour and treasure this\nnugget of information carefully. Like\na loveable medic friend of mine (who\nhas, fortunately, since found his true\ncalling) you can pin it to your wall as a\ndecoration, or you can use it as a topic\nof conversation when the names and\ncourse details of your interlocutors\nhave already been said and instantly\nforgotten. In my first week, the question \u2018what flavour was your condom?\u2019\nearned me as many welcome laughs as\nit did confused expressions. Of course,\nyou may in your youthful brilliance\ninvent yet another function for the offending object. You freshers will never\ncease to amaze me.\nGileadAmitsalutesyourintrepidspirit\n\u201cIt\u2019s fairer to say\nthat the time you\nspend at Imperial\nwill be like a\nparticularly intense\ngame of Monopoly:\nyou: you can win if\nyou know the rules\u201d\n\n"

Though you\u2019re more likely\nto be the latter, we\u2019re all about equal\nopportunities here at Felix, so a big\nshout-out to the tramps of London.\nNow back to the matter in hand.\nYou\u2019ve made it to university and if\nit\u2019s your first time, it is an unrivalled\nexperience. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard it\nall; it\u2019s a fresh start, the best years of\nyour life and so on. Well, I hate to say\nit, but they\u2019re all true.\nIf everything else isn\u2019t exciting\nenough, you\u2019ve also decided to try\nyour hand at one the world\u2019s best\nuniversities. You fool. If you\u2019re one\nto thrive on academia, then you\u2019re at\nthe right place. Every Fresher will have\na lot on their plate though, and it\u2019s just\na choice of what to eat and what to\nleave.\nFirstly, you\u2019re in London. All you can\ndo is explore the sprawling metropolis\nthat is this beautiful city. Visit the obvious sites: Trafalgar Square, Southbank,\nOxford Circus, Camden and whatnot,\nbut there is so much more to see and\ndo, as you might have guessed.\nYou will run into so many things during your years in London, and a lot of\nthem you will do so by accident. You\u2019ll\ndiscover all sorts of places, from cosy\npubs to hidden underground clubs,\nyour new favourite restaurant to your\nnew favourite cafe, and from small\nrecord stalls amongst a bustling street\nmarket to a hidden treasure of a garden\nwhere you\u2019ll waste away many a night.\nThough we\u2019ll have to drag you back\nto Imperial kicking and screaming,\nyou\u2019ll soon realise there\u2019s plenty going\non campus too. It\u2019ll be hard not to hear\nabout what is going on, but it will be\nhard deciding what to start doing first.\nThe Union will help you pack out\nyour events schedule for the first couple\nof weeks. Alongside their bars, shops\nand events, they also help organise\naround 300 clubs and societies that run\nthroughout the year.\nThis issue of Felix contains a plan for\nthis year\u2019s Freshers\u2019 Fair. Freshers\u2019 Fair\nis a chance for you to see and sign up\nto all the different clubs and societies\nthat Imperial has to offer. So make sure\nyou turn up, and head straight to the\nFelix stand. Here, you\u2019ll meet some of\nthe current Editors, and put your name\ndown to write for Felix if you fancy\nyourself as a budding journalist.\nExpect to see Felix littered across\nCollege throughout the week, and\nespecially on Fridays when each issue is released. We\u2019re the student\nnewspaper of Imperial, and that\nmeans we\u2019re entirely student run.\nThough the offices are always a\nplace of laughter and banter, we do\npride ourselves in being the best student newspaper in the country (ask\nthe Guardian Student Media Award\njudges, wahhheyyyyy....). We\u2019re not\nones to rest on past laurels however,\nand that\u2019s why we need you Freshers to make it that much better and...\nwell, fresh.\nWhat you\u2019re reading now is a special issue just for Freshers like you.\nSo feel special, have a read through\nthe paper, chuckle in the appropriate places, put the paper down, then\nstart the rest of your life here at Imperial College.\nFreshers\u2019 Fair 2009\nFreshers\u2019 Fair 2009\nFreshers\u2019 Fair 2009\n\n"

    "content": "Hopefully if you\u2019ve found this guide you are already\nintending to come to Freshers\u2019 Fair or are at least curious\nto know a bit more about it. In essence Freshers\u2019 Fair\nis the Student Union\u2019s biggest event to showcase all of\nthe Clubs & Societies here at Imperial, of which there\nare about 300. What this translates to on the day is a\nhectic, exciting, bustling bazaar of almost everything\nextracurricular that you hope to see at University.\nMy advice to anyone going to Freshers\u2019 Fair for the first\ntime is to keep an open mind. One of the best things\nabout coming to University is the doors that are opened\nto you, and one of them is certainly the variety of things\nthat are available to do and get involved in. For one thing,\nduring your time here you are likely to be able to try things\nout for the cheapest it will ever be until you qualify for\nyour pension. It\u2019s likely that there will be things that you\nare already interested in, and by all means if there is a\nclub for it, seek it out and join up. But its also worth taking\nthe time to wander around to see if there is anything else\nthat takes your fancy. Given the number and diversity of\nClubs & Societies, there is something for everyone going\non at any time of day or any day of the week so it\u2019s not\nuncommon to be a member of more than one club and\nstill leave time for your studies.\nEach location on this guide contains clubs that are\ngrouped broadly according to what it is they do so have\na look for what you are roughly looking for and its likely\nthat there might be other clubs close by that could also\ntempt you. Most clubs will be holding a taster session\nfor free or reduced price in the first couple of weeks of\nterm while your workload isn\u2019t too overwhelming so its\ngood to ask about these and sign up to any mailing lists\nto find out when and where it will all be happening as you\nare by no means signing away your soul by doing this.\nQuite often if you\u2019re finding it hard to decide which club\nto join from a couple its worth going along to a taster of\neach of them as the deciding factor can just be a case\nof where you find the most people you get along with.\nOnce you have decided, it\u2019s never to late to join and you\ncan become a member at any point in the year either by\ngetting in contact with the club or looking them up on\nimperialcollegeunion.org.\nThe last thing to mention is other things going on around\ncampus. Throughout the day there will be a stage on the\nQueens Lawn where many of the performing clubs will\nbe showing off the amazing things they do in addition to\nbeing a good excuse for a rest. Also don\u2019t forget to pop\nover to Beit Quad to check out the clubs located here, the\nUnion stall and INFO stand and Da Vinci\u2019s bar, which will\nbe selling food and drink throughout the day in case you\nget peckish. As if that wasn\u2019t enough we\u2019ll be finishing\noff the day with the Freshers\u2019 Fair Afterparty taking\nplace in Beit Quad which is a great chance to kick back\nand relax after a busy day and talk to many of the people\nalready involved in Clubs & Societies with a line up of live\nperformances from our dance, martial arts, musical and\ncultural Clubs & Societies all in the Union Marquee.\nJennyWilson\nDeputy President (Clubs & Societies)\nGreatHallGH\n4 5 6 8 9 10\n14 15\n19 20\n17 18\n22 23\n24 25\n29 30\n27 28\n32 33\n1\n2\n3\n11\n12\n13\n34 35 36 38 39 40\n7\n37\n16\n21\n26\n31\nJuniorCommonRoomJCR\n17 16 14 13\n4 5 7 8\n15\n18\n3\n12\n9\n11\n1\n6\n2\n10\nFreshers\u2019 Fair 2009\nFreshers\u2019 Fair 2009\nFreshers\u2019 Fair 2009\nT\nuesday 6 October, 11am - 4pm\n\n"

I\nsplit with my girl about a month after\nsummer term finished, I say I split, I\ndidn\u2019t do much of the splitting.

We eat, drink, sleep\nand occasionally buy some ridiculous\ngadget we won\u2019t ever need just so we\ncan say we did to our mates. We are\nnot clairvoyants. Never will be. If some\nshit is wrong, you\u2019re going use your\nmouth and bring it to our attention-or else we will be happy to assume all\nis lush. Maybe work it into a phone\nconversation, because you do love the\nphone. In fact, I\u2019d happily accept a note\nsuck to the fridge- anything really.\n2. We tend to do very little thinking,\nso when you demand of us \u2018what were\nyou thinking?\u2019, we don\u2019t know because\nwe don\u2019t think. We did it for one of two\nreasons: a) banter, b) I was drunk. Either way, we\u2019re sorry. Sit down, have a\ncup of tea, put on Barry Manilow\u2019s \u2018I\nCan\u2019t Smile Without You\u2019 and just chill\nthe fuck out. Then feel free to attack\nus with the rolling pin if you still feel\nit necessary.\n3. On the off chance that we do we\nenquire as to what is bothering you,\nwe do expect, but don\u2019t wish to have\nto recreate Moses\u2019 attempts of getting\nwater from a stone. Could you please\njust make it a lot easier and just, you\nknow... tell us? Then we might ask\nmore often and not just assume everything is dandy, as stipulated in point 1.\n4. Finally, and most importantly:\nif you\u2019ve had a crazy ex-boyfriend,\nplease, please don\u2019t take it out on us.\nWe\u2019ll try our best, but could you observe the above three points and make\na small attempt to follow them?\nNow, I don\u2019t claim to be some great\nadvice giver, well not yet anyway, but\nI can safely say that that is some of the\nmost useful stuff you will read this year.\nForget lectures- do you actually give a\nperfectly formed shit about the complex number j? Guessing not, if you\ndo, you\u2019re a right fucking nut job, go to\nthe Si-Fi library. Finally, just to piss all\nover your small fresher bonfires, there\nare actually no women at Imperial.

You drink 21, no more. Accept this.\nThere are many places to secure\na lager in London, but by far the\ncheapest is the Union- go there\n(we exclude The Goose on North\nEnd Road as you will probably be\ninvolved in a bar fight at closing).\nPersonally, I am attached to Tuborg\nat the moment, 10p more than Foster\u2019s, 0.1% more alcohol content, and\noh yeah, doesn\u2019t taste like a convict\u2019s\npiss. If your desire is to be smashed\noff your nut for the cheapest possible price- Blackthorn is what you\nwant. Now go fill your boots.\nThat\u2019s a beer being poured\nHarold Kushner: \u201cCaring about others, running the risk of feeling, and leaving an impact on people, brings happiness.\u201d\nGraphic music dingbats 1,438\nEach week your lovely crew here in\nfelix think up, and construct these\namazingly funny dingbats.

There\nwill be extra points on offer if you are\nable to offer a witty story linking all the\ntitles. If you feel that you can do bet-ter, pop down, we are always looking\nfor helpers, and to be honest my brain\nbreaks quite often leaving you with\nsome 60s throwback tunes to contend\nwith. All the other editors say my music is shit. I say that they are shit and\nshould go and get a STD from a German prostitute.\nQuote of the Week\nfelix classic caption competition\nAfter a spectacular flop last year, we\nare bringing back the caption competition to try and help us through\nthe long nights. We will decide which\nis the funniest, or which sound like\nthey were sent in by a hot chick and\naward points as we see fit. If you turn\nto the next page you\u2019ll find all there is\nto know about FUCWIT, points and\nmore importantly, those iPods you get\nfor winning. So start being funny and\namuse us.

I\nknow, right. Somehow I tore myself\naway in time to write this thing.\nI\u2019ve also become utterly mesmerised\nby Osmos. I missed it out of the Fresher\u2019s Week of Gaming feature on the opposite page, but do go and look it up on\nSteam if you get the chance, it\u2019s worth\nevery penny.\nRight, I think I\u2019ve gone on for long\nenough. Time to hand over to my partner in crime. Welcome to Imperial,\neveryone.\nMichaelCook Games Editorette\nIt\u2019s like the nineteen-eighties in future-o-vision. Only shit, obviously. Thank god you can switch back.\nDead Games Society\nA\ns you know, young people are stupid - if you\ndon\u2019t know, you\u2019re about\nto find out over the coming weeks. Young people don\u2019t plan ahead, aren\u2019t careful\nwith their money, and probably never\nplayed The Secret Of Monkey Island.\nWithout a large stick and electroshock\ntherapy, I can\u2019t solve the first two, but\nFelix Games is intent on fixing the lat-ter, so this year we\u2019re kicking off the\nDead Games Society, a fortnightly\ncelebration of great, world-changing\ngames that you may not have played\nthe first time around.\nEvery other week we\u2019ll announce\nthe next game we\u2019re looking at, let you\nknow a little about it and offer a copy\nor two as prizes so you can take part.\nThen the next week we\u2019ll spend playing\nthe game and collecting opinions from\nyou folk. The week after we\u2019ll discuss\nthe game, and announce the next one!\nIt\u2019s a flawless plan.\nAs we\u2019re feeling extra nice this week,\nwe\u2019re offering you Fresher types the\nchance to win one of three copies of\nour first game, the aforementioned\nSecret of Monkey Island. Secret is a\npoint-and-click adventure game by\nLucasArts, they of the Star Wars line-age, and it\u2019s an absolutely superb piece\nof gaming. Guybrush Threepwood has\narrived on Melee Island with the intention of becoming a pirate, but he\u2019s a little lacking on skills (other than being\nable to hold his breath for ten minutes).\nWhat follows is an adventure featuring zombie pirates, insult sword-fight-ing, and some of the most famous jokes\n(and therefore injokes) in gaming. It\u2019s a\nhugely, fantastically important game\nand thanks to a recent remake you\u2019ll be\nable to play it despite being the shallow graphics whore that I\u2019m assuming\nGoodgamesdon\u2019tdie,theyjustgetreplayed. A Geek introducesthe\nfirstentryofthisyear\u2019slist\nyou are.\nIt\u2019s our first pick because, for both\nMike and myself, Secret is one of the\nfirst games we have a good memory of,\nand it\u2019s one of the reasons why both of\nus have a special love of puzzle games.\nWe think you\u2019ll like it too, so we\u2019re offering two copies of the game on Steam\n(which you\u2019ll need a PC for) that you\ncan win by sending us an email! It\u2019s that\neasy. It\u2019s literally that easy. Easy.\nWhen you\u2019ve played it, let us know\nwhat you thought. If you\u2019ve played it\nbefore, how does it stand up years later?\nIs it as funny as you remember? Are the\ntwo of us nostalgic old bastards? Let\nus know in an email to games.felix@\nimperial.ac.uk before 27th September\nand we\u2019ll feature some thoughts in this\nsection - or you can tweet us a thought\nby using the hashtag fg0101. That\u2019s\nright. Welcome to Future Towne, population you.\nIntroducing...\nThe Other One\nH\nello, yes, I\u2019m Angry\nGeek and this is, you\nknow, the thing. I\u2019m\nnot really that into in-troductions, so let\u2019s fast\nforward the introductory nonsense in\ncase you\u2019re on the verge of brain death\nafter Mr. Welcome\u2019s smothering editorial over there. I\u2019m The Misanthropic\nOne, because apparently editorial\ndouble-teams have to have one by law.\nI\u2019ll be editing on the weeks when Mike\nisn\u2019t, and you\u2019ll probably like me more\non account of how I\u2019m so fantastically\ncharismatic and obviously right about\neverything.\nI\u2019m very interested in getting people\nplaying outside of their comfort zone. I\nwant to get the non-gamers of Imperial\n(all of whom have already turned the\npage, so we can insult them if you like)\nplaying games, but more importantly I\nwant to get you playing new things. Not\nweird shit, not single-level, three-but-ton \u2018masterpieces\u2019 by media design students from L.A., but just games that are\nimportant, games that are significant.\nI\u2019m one of those bastards that thinks\ngames are Important.\nAs such, I spent this week playing\nMonkey Island, which is a game that\u2019s\nfar too good a game for peons such as\nyou to have played, but fortunately I\u2019m\nall nice and stuff so we\u2019re giving you the\nchance to win a copy. I know, right? I\u2019m\nslightly more generous than God him-self, and he gave us the entirety of exist-ence. And yeah, sure, he gave us AIDS\nand Sonic games, but that only makes\nthe analogy more apt. Okay.\nI\u2019ve also been playing a whole holy\nhell lot of Champions Online. Good\nlord yes. Thankfully, I\u2019ve managed to\nstay far, far away from Mike\u2019s characters\nas they\u2019re all twee and lovey-dovey. One\nof them has a purple cape and fires bolts\nof healing at people. I shit you not.\nI\u2019m unsure of it as a game, to be hon-est. It has a lot to love in there, but it\u2019s\nmissing the sprawling beauty of a game\nlike EVE Online or World of Warcraft.\nI know these things grow over time,\nbut there\u2019s a tendency to knee-jerk at\nany MMO and think \u201cIt\u2019s not WoW, it\u2019s\nbound to fail.\u201d I don\u2019t want it to fail, I\njust am resigned to the fact that it probably will. Look, I did say I was a tit.\nBut it\u2019s got the hook, that\u2019s the key.\nConan was generic, Tabula Rasa was ge-neric, Champions Online is not, it nails\nits atmosphere and it knows what you\nwant to do with it. I\u2019ve got eight charac-ters, each one more ridiculous than the\nlast and they\u2019re all just as I want them.\nIt gives me flight after an hour of play, it\ngives me tiny little robots that kill stuff,\nthe citizens discuss how amazing my\npecs look - it\u2019s just everything it should\nbe, and more besides.\nPhew. I\u2019ve gone on for too long. It\u2019s\ngood though. I\u2019ll do console talk next\nweek, promise.\nThat\u2019s it, really. You\u2019d rather read\nabout games, right? Let\u2019s get on, then.\nAGeek Games Editor\nThat\u2019s the second best game I\u2019ve ever played!\nS\no, why Monkey Island for our\nfirst pick? It\u2019s not the best of\nLucasArts\u2019 adventures, and\nit doesn\u2019t even have all the\nin-jokes you\u2019re thinking of\nright now (a lot of them appeared in\nits sequel). Maybe you don\u2019t even know\nwhat this game is. Let\u2019s go back to the\nstart.\nMonkey Island was in the right place\nat the right time. The Hardware was\nstill a year or two off of truly lifting\noff, but it had reached a plateau where\nsome of the most beautiful two-dimen-sional worlds could be created. The\noriginal graphics - viewable in the new\nremake thanks to some canny design\nwork - don\u2019t hold up today at all, even\nif you have fond memories. But at the\ntime, they conveyed the world just as\nthey were aiming to.\nMonkey Island\u2019s setting of pirates,\nfilth and the occult was the best game\nthat LucasArts had produced in that\ngenre to date, not only hitting the right\nspot technologically, but also providing\na balance between puzzles and pace.\nYou can breeze through the game in a\nquarter of a day, but that\u2019s a good thing\n- think of all the later adventure games\nthat you\u2019ve started and never finished,\nbecause of a single obscure challenge.\nMonkey Island didn\u2019t want you to\nstop every ten minutes to scratch your\nhead, they wanted to lead you down a\npath that let you solve things first time.\nAnd that all ties in with the plot. When\nplaying older games, it\u2019s hard to see\nthrough the age and realise that some of\nthese games would be retail-worthy today\nif only for a visual update.\nMonkey\u2019splotisstillbetterthanmostof\nwhat gets churned out today, and I don\u2019t\nmean in a simply narrative sense. It spoke\nto the player, as many adventure games\nwere beginning to do in those days.\nPlus, it\u2019s funny. Not knob gags or\nknowing, smarmy meta-humour bollocks that we get nowadays, but actual\njokes, like what you get on the television sometimes.\nThe running jokes are such a key part\nof gaming culture now that to have not\nplayed this series of games is to deny\nyourself a whole chunk of modern\ngaming\u2019s thinking today. You see that\nsubhead above? You see that lame attempt at a joke? You don\u2019t even know\nwhy it\u2019s lame, do you! Well frigging get\nthe game and play it!\nFor a lot of you, Monkey Island is the\nvery first adventure game you remem-ber. And if it\u2019s not, make it the very\nlatest.\n\n"

I had no idea what\nthe actual ride would be like so from\nday one climbing through the Edinburgh hills to Berwick was an eye-opening experience as to what was\nin store for the next 5 days. The first\nfew days were very hilly [sic] as well as\nlong, making it really tough. On top\nof that we had some cross winds and a\nlittle bit of rain just to remind us that\nwe were up North! The days were very\nlong, setting off before 9am and arriving after 7pm most nights, just in time\nfor some food and a hot shower.\nFor me the hardest day was cycling\nfrom Newcastle to Leeds; we eventually arrived at 9pm having cycled 110\nmiles and conquered some big hills in\nthe process. There was just enough\ntime to eat and shower before resting\nup for the following day which was another gruelling 105 miles.\nAll in all it was an unforgettable\nchallenge, both physically and mentally and I will cherish the experience for the rest of my life. The camaraderie that came with such a trip\nwas awesome. Each and every one of\nus experienced highs and lows and\nhelped one another throughout the\nweek. Being a part of the sea of yellow shirts that cycled down the mall\nat Buckingham Palace was fantastic\nand brought to life the reality of what\nwe achieved and the reason we had\nraised so much money for Right to\nPlay.\nfelixSport\nSend in your sport reports: sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk High resolution photos only\nACC... not all\nabout the bar\nnights.

Round up! 2008/2009 season a success\nacross the board for Imperial\u2019s sports teams\nSo you\u2019re new to Imperial and want\nto try out a sport during your time\nhere. You read the Freshers\u2019 Handbook\nwhich has all the sports clubs on offer\nbut you still can\u2019t decide which to join\n(if haven\u2019t read it then why not? In case\nyou\u2019re wondering, the Handbook is the\nbooklet with a red front cover. So now\nyou know what it is, go and read it!).\nWell do not fear, felixSport is here to\ngive you a breakdown of some of the\nsports clubs, as well as letting you\nknow how they have performed in the\npast.\nFirst thing\u2019s first, most of the trials will occur on the first Wednesday\nof term (7th October), so be sure to\nhave all your kit ready when you ar-rive; the remaining trials will occur at\nthe weekend(10th-11th October). If in\ndoubt, just ask the members at their\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nMustapher Botchway\nSports\nEditors\nstalls at Freshers\u2019 Fair which is held on\nthe first Tuesday of term. Following the\ntrials on the Wednesday, all the sports\nteams converge onto the Union for\nthe first Sports Night of the year (they\ndon\u2019t actually call it a Sports Night, but\nit pretty much is) so be sure to keep the\nnight free as it is the perfect chance\nfor all of you to meet your fellow club\nmembers and potential friendly rivals.\nBut before you can do any of that, you\nstill need to choose which sport is the\nright one for you. A lot of people decide they want a change when they\ncome to university; this maybe because their school didn\u2019t offer much\nelse apart from rugby for the boys and\nnetball for the girls and cross country\nfor both. At university, however, the\nworld is your oyster and Imperial has a\nwide range of sports. So if you weren\u2019t\nvery good at sport at school but had\nno choice, now you do. Similarly, if\nyou were good at a particular sport,\nthen rest assured our top flight teams\nwill be the right ones for you. All the\nclubs offer the full range of participa-tion, from beginners to national level,\neveryone is welcome and everyone\nsocialises after the games which are\nplayed on Wednesdays and Saturdays.\nSo let\u2019s start from the top of last year\u2019s\nfelixSports League (Page 27).\nIC (College) Tennis Men\u2019s 1sts were\nthe clear winners last year with a perfect 5.0 score to be crowned as the\nchampions.\nThe gentlemen who aspire to be the\nbottle job phenomenon that is Andy\nMurray have certainly proven their\nworth as team of 2008/2009 and can\nonly be described as unbeatable. Blowing away their counterparts in BUCS\nleague 2A, they both scored more\npoints and conceded less than anyone\nin the league. In the BUCS Knockout\nChampionships they emerged victorious as they won all of their rounds.\nWinning over four-fifths of their 31\ngames, the fencers have produced remarkable results. The women stayed\nahead of long-time rivals Oxford over\nthe course of the season to lift the\nBUCS Premiership Trophy. The men\u2019s\n1sts will be in the Premiership next\nyear after going unbeaten in 1A and\neventually destroying Bath 135-37\nin the Premiership Playoff Final. The\n2nds, in a league mainly composed of\n1st teams, finished a respectable 2nd\nContinued on page 27\n\u201cMost of the trials\nwill occur on the\nfirst Wednesday\nof term, so be sure\nto have all your kit\nready\u201d\n\n"

A ride of pure joy.\nAt your beck and call\nHello and welcome to Imperial and fe-lix. This is where I pull together some\nadvice to let you know what I wish I\nknew at the start of my time at Imperial. The most important thing is to get\nthe balance right between studying and\nhaving a good time. Obviously everyone has different targets and levels of\ndrive, but you still must remember that\neither extremes of studying or partying\nare bad for you.\nIf you\u2019re having personal problems\nor are struggling with your workload\nthere\u2019s a number of people you can\nturn to.\nLet someone know you\u2019re struggling,\nbe it friends. This can be your personal\ntutor, one of the wardens in your halls\nor myself in the Union. Imperial College Union is a separate organisation\nfrom Imperial College, so if you have\na problem and feel you can\u2019t talk to\nsomeone in College about it, free confidential and independent advice can\nbe given by the us.\nWe also have a dedicated Student\nAdviser, Nigel Cooke, who works in\nthe Advice Centre on level 2 mezza-nine. You can come and see him about\nany issue, including Academic Advice,\nAccommodation, Complaints, Consumer Rights, Diversity and Equality, Employment Rights, Exam Stress,\nHealth and Wellbeing, International\nStudent Issues, Money Advice and Personal Safety.\nNigel also has links with all the College welfare services and also legal advice centres in the local community,\nso if he can\u2019t help we can find someone who will be able to locally. We are\nalso full members of Advice UK which\nis an agency which encourages good\npractice in advice centres around the\ncountry. The Advice Centre acts as an\nadvocate for students; to College and\nalso to outside organisations when we\nfeel a student needs extra help to solve\nan issue, acting on your behalf with\nyour permission.\nBoth Nigel and myself are in close\ncontact with the College welfare serv-ices, including the Health Centre,\nStudent Counselling Service, Careers\nAdvisory Service and Disability Officer. For more details check out the\nInformation and Advice pages on our\nwebsite. The Chaplaincy is also available to talk about any issues you may\nwant to talk about.\nPersonal safety is paramount and\nwhen planning a night on the tiles it\u2019s\nimportant not only to decide on the\nmultitude of seedy venues that make\na good night out, but also to sort out\nyour route home. The route planner\non the Transport for London website is\namazing and it\u2019s always worth memo-rising the route of the number 14 bus.\nIt goes pretty close to the favourite\nstudent hot spots in the West End and\nruns all round the clock. Also remember that the number for Cabwise is also\ngiven on every bus stop. It\u2019s run by TFL\nYou probably know by now, but Deputy President (Welfare)\nJohn James reiterates: we are here to guide, help and advise\nand if you text 60835, they send you the\nnumbers of one taxi firm and two licensed minicab operators near to your\ncurrent location. It costs the standard\nnetwork rate +35p, but it\u2019s a small price\nto pay for a safe journey home.\nBoth of us will be at Freshers\u2019 Fair\nhanding out condoms and other goodies (personal attack alarms, night bus\nmaps, cycle routes etc), so if you have\nany questions or want to say hello, pop\nover and see us, especially if you want\nto lend a hand running some of the\nWelfare Campaigns we have planned\nthis year. Remember that the next few\nweeks of settling in are going to be a bit\nof a rollercoaster, but that the friends\nyou make in the next year will probably\nbe the ones that you keep for the rest of\nyour life. With that in mind I can only\nencourage you to get out and meet\nas many people as possible, be nice\nto them, avoid eating fat, read a good\nbook every now and then, get some\nwalking in and try and live together in\npeace and harmony with people of all\ncreeds and nations. Here\u2019s the theme\nmusic.\nAdvising you\nwell......\nH\ni, my name is Nigel Cooke.\nI am the Student Adviser\nhere at Imperial College\nUnion and I work in The\nAdvice Centre.\nI am here to help you with any Welfare issues you may have during your\ntime studying here these include:\n\u2022 Academic appeals and\ncomplaints\n\u2022 Debt Advice\n\u2022 Housing Rights\n\u2022 Employment Rights\n\u2022 Consumer Rights\n\u2022 Personal Safety\n\u2022 International Students Issues\nI also can help with issues such as\ndrugs, alcohol and sexual health. You\nmay never need our service but now\nyou are here, being a student it is not as\neasy as people think and you may face\nstruggles or issues that you feel you cannot handle yourself.\nThe Advice Centre is your free service for confidential, impartial and independent advice. At the union we pride\nourselves on being independent so you\ncan be sure that if you approach us with\nan issue, we will give you our honest\nopinion on the issue and help to empower you to solve it.\nThe Advice Centre also has links with\nall college welfare agencies and legal\nadvice centres in the local community.\nSo if we can\u2019t help, we can find someone\nwho will be able to locally. We are also\nfull members of Advice UK, an agency\nwhich encourages good practice in advice centres.\nThe Advice Centre advocates for\nstudents both to the college and also\nto outside organisations. When we\nfeel you, the student, needs extra help\nwe can act on your behalf with your\npermission.\nWe also consider ourselves to be an\ninformation giving service, so if you just\nneed some information on the college\nor the local area we are the best people\nto contact for this. We will be able to\npoint you in the right direction.\nSo whether you just want some information on where the best local place\nis to get a burger or if you have a more\npressing issue, make The Advice Centre\nyour one stop shop for all your welfare\nissues and needs.\nThe Advice Centre will have a stall\nat Fresher\u2019s Fair, so if you fancy getting\na freebie and having a chat feel free to\ncome over for a natter!\nThe Advice Centre is situated in the\nmezzanine level of the Union building\nin the Beit Quad.\nNigelCooke Student Adviser\nMake sure that you\u2019re vaccinated against infections!\nFortunately, mumps and meningitis\nare rare illnesses. However, they do\noccur, and when they do they tend to\nbe in the student age group. There are\nseveral reasons for this, but the first\nweek of term is not the time (and Felix\nis not the place) for an epidemiology\nlecture in infectious disease and herd\nimmunity. Suffice to say that a large\ngroup of partially vaccinated adults\nfrom different parts of the world, living and working in close proximity and\noften in close contact with each other,\nprovides an ideal opportunity for these\nrare infections to occur. And they do.\nUnfortunately, when they do occur they can be serious. Meningococcal disease (meningitis) can kill, and\nmumps can lead to reduced fertility.\nFor this reason in the UK there is a free\nvaccination programme for those up to\nand including 24 years of age i.e. those\nmost at risk. The vaccinations dramatically reduce an individual\u2019s chances of\ndeveloping these illnesses, but they are\nnot perfect: there is still a small chance\nof infection.\nUnder the current NHS vaccination\ncriteria, people aged 25 and above are\nnot eligible for free vaccinations as\nthey are at much reduced risk.\nRegardless of our vaccination status,\nage, or any other factor, all of us need\nto be aware of the early signs of these\ninfections. For more information see\nthe leaflets in your Health Centre Welcome Pack or visit our website www.\nimperialcollegehealthcentre.co.uk.\nYou need to make sure that you are\ncovered. Have you had:\n\u2022 Two mumps vaccinations\n\u2022 One meningitis C vaccination\nIf you are under 25 years old you need\nto be absolutely sure you have had\nthe appropriate vaccinations against\nmumps and meningitis C.\nThe best way to find out whether\nyou have had these vaccinations is to\nask your parents. Your GP may have\na record of your childhood vaccinations but may not know if you have had\nMenC (the meningitis C vaccination).\nEven if you are eligible to register with\nus, Imperial College Health Centre will\nnot receive your NHS notes for several\nmonths, by which time it is too late.\nIf you are at all unsure about having\nhad these vaccinations please contact\nthe Health Centre as soon as possible.\nThis is urgent as the vaccinations take\nseveral weeks to work, during which\ntime you may be at increased risk of\nthese illnesses. We are running special vaccination clinics during the\nfirst week of term to try and minimise\nthe risk to students so visit www.im-perialcollegehealthcentre.co.uk/\nvaccinations.\nHaving too many vaccinations is\nnot a problem, so where there is any\ndoubt we usually give the vaccination\nrather than put you at increased risk of\ninfection.\nBefore I go, there\u2019s time to tell you\nmore about the Health Centre. Your\nhealth is likely the last thing your mind\nis on at the start of term. However it\nis strongly recommended that you are\nregistered with a GP local to where\nyou live in term time. Most students\nare eligible to register with us. Do this\nquickly, before you become ill! We offer a host of services so please visit\nwww.imperialcollegehealthcentre.\nco.uk for more information.\nHave you had the following?:\n\u2022 Two mumps vaccinations\n\u2022 One meningitis C vaccination\nYES NO\nI DON\u2019T\nKNOW!\nGreat! Nothing to\nworry about then.\nRegister with the Health\nCentre and book yourself\nin for a vaccination.\nAsk your parents. If\nthey don\u2019t know, get\nvaccinated anyway.\nDr.DavidHayton ICHealthcareCentre GP\nImperial College Health Centre\nImperial College Health Centre is\nlocated underneath Southside Halls\nin Princes Gardens, off Exhibition\nRoad.\nTo contact them:\nTelephone: 020 7584 6301\nImperial Ext: 49375/6\nFax: 020 7594 9390\nEmail: healthcentre@imperial.ac.uk\nFor more information on their\nrange of services, visit:\nwww.imperialcollegehealthcentre.co.uk\nThe Advice Centre is above the\nbarsm on the Mezzanine level (2M)\nof the Union Building in the Beit\nQuad.\nTel: 020 7594 8067\nImperial Ext: 48067\nE-mail: advice@Imperial.ac.uk\nWebsite:\nwww.imperialcollegeunion.org.uk/advice\n\n"

So it seemed only\nfitting to ask him what he sees the Bar\nNights as and what his plans are with\nthem this year.\n\u201cI see the Bar Nights as a great place\nto meet up with like minded sports-people, have a few, or ten, beers and\nthen dance the night away to Geri\nHalliwell\u2019s It\u2019s Raining Men\u201d Chaz informed me before breaking into a familiar giggle.\nContinuing, \u201cNo seriously, it\u2019s not all\nabout the beer. It\u2019s just a good, cheap,\nfun-filled night. It worked so well last\nyear that we\u2019re just going to keep it the\nway it is.\u201d\nLet us not beat around the bush here,\nthe ACC Bar Nights have a huge reputation and is guaranteed to fill out the\nUnion, with many clubs using it as an\nopportunity to dress up. The best bit\nabout this is that it only costs you \u00a35\nand there are unlimited beers.\n\u201cNot strictly true\u201d said Chaz. \u201cWe\nget about 23 kegs (80+ pints per keg)\nfor these events, but they seem to go\nthrough them quite quickly.\u201d\nTurning to more serious issues, I\nasked Chaz what his thoughts were on\nthe \u2018scandal\u2019 last year, where last year\u2019s\nACC Chair and Treasurer gave their\nown clubs more money than in previous years.\n\u201cI think Sam [ACC Chair 2008-2009] was guilty of nothing more than\na greater awareness of his own clubs\nproblems than those of other clubs.\u201d\nIt was a political answer, one that he\nthought about a fair bit, and when\nprobed further, he said that \u201cI\u2019ll take\nextra precautions when it comes to the\nbudgeting of hockey, American Football and riding & polo [the clubs of the\nACC exec members] next year, probably getting Danny Hill [Deputy President (Finance & Services)] to have a\nlook at them.\u201d\nRealising that we could probably talk\nabout this topic for several hours over\nseveral beers, I thought I\u2019d change the\ntone to a more light-hearted one and\nsimply asked him if he could down\na pint. His response was to down his\nTuborg, although it did take him a\ngood 11 seconds. However, the competitive nature of Chaz has him to this\nday, disputing this (sluggish) time.\n\u201cOh, and the boat races are definitely\ngoing to continue next year, since it\u2019s\nalways fun to see the rugby and football clubs lose to the hockey club!\u201d\nChaz conjured, through half a burp as\nhe finished his beer. Of course I [and\nme - Ed] somewhat doubt the accuracy\nof his statement.\nAfter refilling the pints, we carried\non with the interview and turned our\nattentions to what he actually plans to\ndo this year, specifically with the freshers\u2019 at the start of the year.\n\u201cFor the first Wednesday of term (7th\nOctober), after the Freshers\u2019 Trials, the\nACC clubs have the sole use of the Union for about an hour-and-a-half to introduce the freshers into sporting life,\nthe Union bars and Wednesday night\nbanter, without the worries of them\nbeing bullied by some\nof the older memWe\u2019re not just about the Bar Nights...\nACC Chair interview\nJovan Nedi\u0107 Assistant Editor\n\u201cI see the barnights\nas a place to have\na few, or ten beers\nand then dance\nthe night away to\nGeri Halliwell\u2019s It\u2019s\nRaining Men\u201d\nber of their clubs.\u201d This great event\nwill cost the freshers only \u00a35, which is\na bargain considering that entry into\nthe Union that night will cost you \u00a36.\nHe also informed me that the tickets\nfor this event will be sold through the\nsports teams on the Wednesday, so be\nsure to bring enough money with you.\nLooking forward to the rest of the\nyear, I was curious to see what Chaz\u2019s\nfeelings were on the age old argument\nof performance over participation.\n\u201cNo, no, no. It\u2019s going to be participation over perfection for me,\u201d interrupted Chaz as I was asking the ques-tion. He was obviously keen to get this\nmessage across.\n\u201cI\u2019d be much happier if students were\nable to join the clubs and societies,\nhave a great time and actually enjoy\nwhat they do. With increased partici-pation, the perfection will come and\nthe clubs will naturally perform at a\nhigher standard, as we can see with\nhockey, rugby and fencing.\u201d\nTo round up, we looked toward the\nannual Varsity in which the majority\nof College and Medicals teams play\nagainst each other.\nThe event is huge and is fuelled with\nrivalry that no one is entirely sure its\norigin. During the day, hockey, foot-ball, rugby, lacrosse battle it out at Harlington Sports ground, whilst at Ethos,\nnetball, squash, waterpolo, badminton\nand basketball fight out their matches\nbfeore everyone converges upon Richmond Athletic Ground to watch the\nrugby Men\u2019s 1st battle for the JPR Williams Cup. Imperial have always won\nthe day but never the cup, Chaz\u2019s prediction for this year?... Medics.\n\n"

It\u2019s also one of those few\nmeals that\u2019s easier to cook for one. It can be eaten plain but it\u2019s often what you put in it that makes\nit. Serve with salad to again get your fruit and veg total topped-up.\nTime: Less than 10 minutes\nCost: 60p- \u00a31 depending on topping\nIngredients: \u2022 2-3 eggs, depending on how hungry you are\n\u2022 Small knob of butter\n\u2022 Salt and pepper\nMethod: Break the eggs into a bowl and add salt and pepper. Break up with a fork but do not whisk or beat\nthem. Place a frying pan on the highest heat and melt the butter, tipping the pan to cover the surface. When the butter is frothing, tip in the eggs and\nleave for 10 seconds. Tilt the pan, pushing one side of the omelette up so that the runny egg fills the gap, and repeat on the other side. When the egg\nis mostly solid, fold it in half and cook for another 10 seconds. When most of the liquid egg has gone, tip onto a plate, folding it in half again and serve\nimmediately. You can add grated cheese, herbs, cooked bacon or cooked vegetables to the mixture before cooking to add flavour.\nOmelette\nOften overlooked by students because of the time it takes to cook them, jacket potatoes are great for\ncolder nights when you\u2019re too tired or busy to fuss around in the kitchen. As long as you put the potato\nin the oven before you\u2019re hungry, you can get on with some study or watching TV while it\u2019s cooking.\nTime: 1 hour\nCost: 60p-\u00a31.50 depending on topping\nIngredients: \u2022 1 jacket potato\n\u2022 Salt\nMethod: Heat the oven to 180\u00b0C. Wash the jacket potato and pierce with a fork a few times so\nit doesn\u2019t explode. Rub with some salt and place it in the oven. Medium sized-potatoes will take about\nan hour, but to check it\u2019s ready pierce with a knife and it should be soft all the way through. Serve\nwith melted butter and cheese or beans (or both) or a tuna mix.\nJacket Potato\nHaving a poorly-stocked cupboard is one of the key reasons students over-spend on last-minute purchases. One of the best ways to keep costs\ndown and reduce stress is to plan a bit in advance so you always have something on hand to whip up last minute. Avoid wandering around the\nsupermarket aimlessly- lists a are frugal cook\u2019s best friend. The following is by no means a comprehensive list, but it\u2019s a start. It means you\u2019ll be\nable to make a lot of the meals mentioned above with the purchase of one or two fresh items in some instances. Your freezer should become\nyour best friend- take advantage of the larger space by freezing larger meals in portion sizes (they\u2019re impossible to split when frozen!). This is\nparticularly useful for sauces such as tomato sauce and mince.\nTINS:\n\u2022 Tinned tomatoes\n\u2022 Tinned tuna (in water or oil is fine)\n\u2022 Baked Beans\nFROZEN FOOD:\n\u2022 Sliced bread (for toast)\n\u2022 Frozen peas\n\u2022 Frozen sweetcorn\n\u2022 Fish fingers or fish cakes for\nemergencies\nSAUCES/ CONDIMENTS/ OILS:\n\u2022 Mayonnaise\n\u2022 Ketchup\n\u2022 Mustard\n\u2022 Soy sauce\n\u2022 White wine vinegar\n\u2022 Olive oil\n\u2022 Vegetable oil\n\u2022 Jar of pesto\n\u2022 Tomato puree\nSPICES:\n\u2022 Salt (sea salt is good)\n\u2022 Pepper (in a mill is better)\n\u2022 Cinnamon\n\u2022 Dried flaked chillis or chilli powder\n\u2022 Oregano\nDRIED FOOD:\n\u2022 Sugar\n\u2022 Flour\n\u2022 Rice\n\u2022 Pasta (spaghetti and shapes)\nby Hannah Theodorou\nStore cupboard essentials\n\n"
