Anyway these\nare the latest batch ol new and\nused singles that IC Radio has\nbeen sent: First oil\" is Gerry\nRafTerty's new single which I am\nreliably informed is getting quite\na lot of airplay (Tris has heard it\nanyway). Poor Gerry started of l with such an enormous hit that all\n-his other singles since have been\ncompared to it. un favourably more often than not (you do\nremember ' Baker Street' don't you?) This nasty tactic is used by\nrecord reviewers to avoid talking\nabout the record in its own right,\nfor example I could say about this\none; 'Nice try by the Baker Street\nman, but unfortunately not up to\nthe same standard. Lacks the\nsaxophone and the incisive guitar\nplaying, cannot achieve the same\nsuccess\", but I won't. Kirsty Mac Coll; 'They don't know' (Stiff) I hadn't heard of this\nwoman before but seeing as the\nrecord is on the Stiff label, I thought I would check it out (also\nbecause her picture on the sleeve\nis quite appealing). Her voice\nsounds uncannily like Poly\nStyrene's would if she could sing\nmelodically.\nNice voice, shame about the\ntune., ft could be that Ms Mac Coll has no intention ol\nsinging anything of great ei consequence than this limp ditty,\nbut if she does I 'll sit up and listen.\nThe Regulars; 'Fool's Game'.\nTipped to be very big, the\nRegulars are part of the\nspearhead that Reggae is shoving\nfirmly into the charts. While this\nsong compromises slightly in the\ndirection of MOR, it has a pleasant effect on the eardrums\nBob Marle y has proved that\nreggae can make hit records\nwithout making concessions for\nmass acceptance, but then there is\nonly one Bob Marley. Anyone, by\nthe way, that says Bob Marley\nisn't real reggae can drop dead.\nJean Jacques Burnel; Freddie\nLaker (Concorde and Eurobus)..\nThis gave me a bit of a shock to be\nhonest. It starts off, as you would\nexpect, with a bit of Bass guitar ing( almost like 'Peaches'), then it\nblisters along at a great pace until\nthe vocals start, if you can call\nthem vocals. Someone has had a cement mixer surgically implanted on their vocal track\nfrom the bottom of the Atlantic,\nand these are the good points!\nToo wie rd for me. Wayne County\nand the Electric Chairs: 'Berlin' I have to confess that despite the\nfuss being made over her, t have\nnot heard any of her songs before,\nso I can only say what sort of\nimpression this song made on me.\nThe ambivalent gender of the\nvoice is distracting, I am not sure\nwhich M County is at the\nmoment, but either way he/she/it\nhas a distinctive style which is not\nunpleasant, but does not seem to\nfit in with the darkly sinister\nbacking track. I am told that the\nsingle with the rude title...you\nknow the one; 'If you don't want\nto F. ck me, F. ck of l!( modesty and\nthe Law prevent me from printing\nit in full)... was much more\nbouncy and sing along, even if the\nchorus is decide ly not the sort of\nthing to sing in the bath while\nyour Mum is in the house.\nLast one but one then, the end\nis nigh. Tim Hart with 'Overseas'.\nThe name of this blok e rings a bell, and from the sound of the\nsong he could have been in some\ngroup like F 'airport before any of\nus were born. The title lends itself\nvery nicely to nasty rock-reviewer\ntype comments like 'Overseas is\nwhere Tim Hart and all his\nrecords should be, the nearer to\nSiberia the better', but sadly for\nme it does merit further\ncomment, so I have to think of\nsomething original and witty to\nsay about it. It has a pleasant\nRECORDS enough tune, makes no demands\non your brain, and il it is sunny in\nthe next two months will\nprobably be a hit.\nF'inally I will ask Tris to give\nyou a review of the last record\nwhich is from Dr Feelgood, and\n'As long as the price is right' is the\nname of it (as JP says). Well\nTris?...Perhaps!!!...I say perhaps,\nBecause , not having heard\nthe record, I don't consider myself\nparticularly well qualified to\njudge it. Ah!... Leigh's just about\nto play if for me. An ga bart! having now heard\nit) Perhaps!!!Thank you Tris\nfor that scathing attack and\nvicious criticism, I'd better tell\nyou it's pretty standard Feelgood's fare, not as good as\n' Milk and Alcohol', but just about\nthe best of this bunch, in fact\nsingle of t. he week, in fact single of\nthe decade, nobody cares what I think anyway, you all sit out there\nreading this and it makes no\nimpression on you, well I say this\nrecord is the Greatest single of all\ntime. Phew! sorry... I get carried\naway sometimes. It is exam time\nafter all. Before closing this weeks\nepistle I must thank the person in\nFELIX who has to wade through\nthis to type it up, also IC Radio for\nletting me use their studios, and of\ncourse my Mum and Dad without\nwhom I would not have been\npossible. See you next Year!\n: ROWING\nBoat Club\nDouble Victory British University Champions\nAt the recent British University Sports Federation Rowing\nChampionships, two IC crews representing The University of\nLondon, triumphed against strong opposition to become BUS F Champions. The cox ed four beat Newcastle and Nottingham\nin the final, while Chris Howell stretched his unbeaten run to\nseven wins in taking the single sculls. The cox less four\nnarrowly lost to a heavier Durham crew by 3 feet.\nThese events were held in Nottingham on the 2000m course, on the\nsame weekend as Nottingham City regatta. The Boat Club also\ncompeted in this on Sunday. The successes were the cox ed l ours who\nwon the senior A event and the Women who walked away w ith Ladies\nNovice fours.\nThe cox ed four, beaten on Saturday in the Senior Al in al by\nWallingford School, walked away with the same event on the Sunday.\nThe Ladies four started like a rocket and were always in the lead in their\nevent, winning by over 30 sees in only a four minute race.\nThe first eight had its first race with a new crew order on the Sunday\nand after a promising start, never really put it together and finished a disappointing fourth, with some work to do before the next regatta.\nBack in London on the same weekend, another Crew of ladies were\nbeaten by Reading University at Putney Town Regatta while the Mens\nSenior C four reached the final at Thames Ditton Regatta only to\nsuccumb to a crew from Barts.\nAll in all a successful and enjoyable weekend.\nBoat Club Overruns Cambridge\nThe Boat Club Team sent to Cambridge Regatta went with\nhigh expectations and lived up to them with IC being the most\nsuccesful club at the regatta, winning three events and a total\nof nine races.\nIn Elite VIIIs a small but high quality entry saw IC racing Jesus\ncollege in the final. A close race was expected, but the winners of the\nhead of the Cam just three weeks ago could not hold the IC boat who\npowered away to win by over l our lengths.\nThe Senior A IV had to race events similarly proved to be\nmore often for their prizes with\nopposition in the first two races\ncoming from Star Club and\nBedford RC. Both races were won\nin a comfortable manner the crew\npaddling over to win with barely\na hair out of place. The final was\nexpected to be a different story,\nthe opposition from Marlow RC were known to be a fast\ncombination, and the IC four\nknew they had to snap out of their\nleisurely ways. The Big Race\nTemperament was found and\nMarlow were left wondering\nwhich way IC went.\nThe Senior C event saw yet\nanother final lor this persistent,\nbut as yet unsuccessful, crew.\nAfter winning by good margins in\ntheir first two rounds it looked\ngood, but in the final Berkhamslead School proved just\ntoo strong for IC. The Novice\noutside our grasp with both men\nand women losing first round.\nThe most notable achievement\nof the day must be the Womens\nSenior B crew. Having only won\ntheir novices the week before,\nthey found themselves drawn\nagainst a strong crew from\nLondon University. The race\nwent to plan, however, and after\nconceding a little at the start our\ngirls rowed through to win by 1\n1/2 lengths. The next race was\nduly won and in the final the\nopposition was Girton Collegethe fastest womens' crew in\nCambridge with all of its\nmembers coming from the\nUniversity Boats. Not intimidated by this our crew were never\nheaded and won by an easy\nverdict. Things look very promising for Womens'Rowing at\nIC.\n\n"

    "content": "Page 2\nSir , - You will probably say I'm being pedantic, but with things\nlike Union policy you have to be.\nThe policy we passed at the last\nU GM does not mean what it\nappears to mean at first glance.\nThere are several cases.\n' ICU.. instructs... that we\nsupport AL RA'. We? Who is ICU instructing to support AL RA? The proposer s ol the motion?\n'We support AL RA.' What is\nAL RA? Architects and Land Researchers Association? They\ncan't mean Abortion Law Reform Association, because\naccording to notes 2 this AL RA does not support abortion after 28\nweeks, but the abortion law\nreform association supports it\nbetween 28 weeks and birth for\nconditions more liberal than the\npresent Abortion Act. (See their\nnewsletter 'Breaking Chains'\nMay77).' ICU instructs delete all\nprevious policy on abortion.' This\nis meaningless. Besides which we\nhad no policy on abortion. If the v mean my last motion, that was on\nthe NAC( an organisation), not\nabortion.\nWorst of all, because my\namendment was partially accepted we have' ICU believes.. abortion should be\navailable free on demand...' and\n'instruct the NHS to...always act\nwith the intention of saving both\nthe mother and child.' (Child is a legally acceptable term for a foetus). If these can be reconciled\nat all it can only mean we support\nAbortion on demand (removing\nthe child from the womb) only if it\nis done in such a way as to avoid\nkilling it (almost impossible).\nOh dear. It appears we\nfilli buster ed it. And quite unintentionally.\nBarry Austin\nP.S. What's the use of increasing\nday care facilities if the NHS is not\nallowed to use them?\nDear Sir, - In last week's FELIX, there was a small ad for the sale of\ntins of ex-boycott baked beans - to\nquote - ' Only90 p for a51b tin'.\nThere was also a reference to the\nsale of these tins in News in Brief\nheaded 'Cheap Beans'. I fail to see\nthat unless these beans are\nindividually wrapped or of\nextraordinary quality or size they\ncan be termed cheap. In Waitrose\na20 oz tin is 18p this means only\n72p for 51bs of baked beans. (I have checked this carefully -being a mathematician). I was not\naware that generally large\nquantities bought from a discount\nwarehouse worked out more\nexpensive than small tins purchased in a shop.\nRuth Langford\nMaths1 P. S.Even extortionate ly expensive Heinz Baked Beans\nwould only cost 88p for 51bs. Dear Sir, -1 would like to make it\nknown that the events of Saturday\nnight (shortly alter the EnglandScotland match) disgusted and\nappalled me. That alcohol should\nbe consumed in such quantity for\nsuch unconstructive and heathen\npurposes is barbarous, and the\nsight of drunken Northerners\nlying on the floor came as a revelation.\nAs a result I do not intend to\ntouch alcohol until at least the\nnext bank holiday, and would\nurge all like minded students in\njoining me in abstaining from the\npractice of imbibing that infernal\nliquid, alcohol.\nYours displeased,\nK.J. Fenning,\nPhysics\nDear Sir, - I would like to make a few points as regards Mr Bambridge's letter last week. The\nInsurance policy covering the\npossessions of those living in\ncollege run residence was\nchanged at the beginning of last\nAugust for several reasons - the\nnew policy covered goods lost all\nover the college campus, whereas\nthe old one only covered each\nperson's particular hall/house/\nflat, and the other main reason\nwas that the cover was increased\nto \u00a3750, whereas the old policy\nwas only \u00a3500; which I'm sure\nmost people would agree is\ninadequate - a lot of students have\nstereo systems worth more than\n\u00a3300 never mind anything else.\nThe \u00a375 limit on records and\ncassettes is unfortunate, and is\nmostly due to the incompetence of\nEndsleigh. The original letter I had from them about the new\npolicy went over the changes but\nfailed to mention this - and I was\nlater verbally told that this 10%\nlimit for records, cartridges and\ncassettes was the same for the old\npolicy and being unfamiliar with\nthe old one I took this to be true,\nand it was only much later on that\nI found out it was different.\nAlso with the old policy if you\nhad goods worth, say, \u00a31000 and\n\u00a3300 worth was pinched you\nwould only get \u00a3150, as the total\nvalue of the goods owned was\ntwice the limit-this is not the case\nwith the new policy.\nOne thing Mr Bambridge has\nneglected also is that the old\npolicy, as in common with most\nhousehold policies, insured not\nthe replacement value but the\npresent value, taking into account\ndeterioration so the claim for 45\ncassettes would be considerably\nless than \u00a3230.\nAs regards the policy itself and\nthe changeover, this year's experience will be taken into\naccount when considering the\nrenewal of the policy, and\nMichael Arthur and I will\ndefinately look for and consider\nany alternatives very carefully.\nI did inform people of the\nchangeover in FELIX at the start\nof the year several times through\nmy articles and also by a small\nadvert; I would have informed the\nWardens of the halls/houses\nexcept I thought Residence Office\nwould do that. I could not take\nthe change of policy to aUG M as\na decision was necessary during\nthe summer vacation.\nAnd now for something completely different. Mr Ronan in his letter of last week is\nincorrect when he says a new-society can overlap with an\nalready existing society. In\ncouncil minutes it is stated that if\nthe overlap is too great then the\nnew society will not be\nrecognised.\nCheers,\nMike Elk in Dear Editor, - Each week FELIX is put on my desk (such a nice\nyoung man brings it round) and\nwhen I stop for my hot and\nsteaming life saver, I pick it up to\nread. However, I do have one\ngripe about your estimable paper\n(the covers are such pretty\ncolours) why so many abbreviations?\nPresumably those in the\nsocieties involved know what they\nmean but those of us to whom IC\n(translation given on request) is a living and not a social event, very\noften do not have a clue. On the\nletters page alone, I picked up the\nfollowing: AG M,UG A,RCS, ICU,S CC,I CW A,N AC,B PAS, PATA. I am sure the remaining\n14 pages would have yielded a wealth of others.\nMany times have f labour ed far\ninto the night, coffee and\ncigarettes at my elbow, poring\nover FELIX with pencil and\npaper, dictionary and IC (see\nabove) Handbook trying to make\nhead or tail of it. Perhaps the\naverage student at IC (think\nabout it) has more up top than I have - or maybe it really is a secret\nformula for turning lead into\ngold!\nFor those of us who are not 'in\nthe know' please translate some of\nthese symbols to make FELIX intelligible to the uninitiated.\nMrs Lynn Fanning\n(A member of the underpaid,\nunder-rated\nand generally ignored Administration staff)\nDear John, - I would like to thank\nyou for your prompt coverage of\nRCS events but 1 feel I must\ncorrect the errors in the article\nentitled Stripper Out, based on a motion, passed at R CSU General\nCommittee, which I proposed.\nFirstly, the motion made no\nmention of the stripper and so it is\nnot union policy to remove it.\nThis may well occur as a consequence but will have to be\ndecided at a later date by the ents\ncommittee.\nSecondly, the reference to\nundemocratic minorities was not\naimed at the women at IC but\nthose people who go to the\nSmoking Concert to disrupt and\ndrink the free beer.\nFinally, I would like the chance\nto publicly explain why the name\nwill be changed to the Head lights\nRevue. Everyone at General\nCommittee, and I think generally\nthroughout College, agrees that\nthe 'Smoking Concert' has reach\ned the lowest possible depths and\nthe very fact that the 'Smoking\nConcert' is a tradition means the\nonly possible way to achieve a worthwile night's entertainment\nis to change the name and thus\nbury the memories of the farces of\nthe past.\nAny budding theatrical person\nwho thinks they would enjoy\nproducing a class revue and\nanyone who could contribute\nwith a sketch which will be well\nrehearsed and entertaining, no\nmatter how depraved, can see me\nanytime.\nMany thanks for letting me\nexplain the change,\nRich Archer R CSU Entertainments Chairman elect.\nFELIX CORK\nCOLLECTING\nCOMPETITION\nPRIZE OF 1 BOTTLE\nOF LIEBFRAUMILCH\nfor the person submitting the\ngreatest number of used wine\ncorks to the FELIX Office by\n5:30pm next Wednesday\n\n"

As3 players then made\ntheir way by public transport, his next mistake was to ignore\nadvice and miss the correct bus stop.\nOn eventual arrival Furnish elected to bat, having won the toss, as it\nappeared that the weather may allow one innings only. As always, later\nresults showed this to be an inspired decision despite the immediate\nopinions of the rest of the team.\nThe IC batting began badly, though opener Davis, who scored more\nin one shot than Pitts has made in 3 innings, made a brisk 30, but it was\na5 th wicket stand of vigorous mis hits from Toplis and Ellacott that\neventually saw IC through to a respectable 111.\nAt tea the captaincy was passed Toplis and the ageing Ellacott,\nto stand-in wicket keeper and 5th XI captain Pitts to give him the\nchance to do something properly.\nToplis and Ellacott removed\nthe first 5 wickets for 11 with slow-leg breaks, but the Kingston\nvictims were unable to help their\nteam mates by telling them\nanything about the bowling, as\nthey had failed to see it. This\nparticularly applies to the 5th wicket who was caught at first slip\nby the agile Furnish, the ball\nhaving passed Pitts without\nthe 'keeper noticing.\nThe advent of Chad band into\nthe attack saw Pitts stand up to\nthe stumps, but realising that his\nnose was close to the batsman's who was now suffering with his\narthritic hip, lack of sawdust, and\na double groin strain which\noccured immediately after the\npassage across the field at the lady\nin black boots, were brought back\nto mop up the rabbits with the last\n14 overs. This they narrowly\nfailed to achieve, Kingston\nfinishing with 57 for 9.\nToplis returned the creditable\nfigures of 5 for 14, but failed to\nbuy a jug, and Ellacott may take\ncomfort in the thought that\nalthough injuries may force him to retire from cricket next week,\nhe could still make a comeback in\nabout 25 years for South\nStanmore.\nfeet he retired again.\nTeam: Pills, Furnish, Toplis, Ellacott, Davis, Maguire, Clothier, Chadband.\nTennis On Wednesday we played our\nfirst mixed doubles match,\nagainst Gardens LTC. This was\ndue to be played at Harlington,\nbut the courts were unfit for play,\nso we all jumped into Tony's car\nand trundled off in the general\ndirection of Wimbledon. However,\nwhile we were touring round the\nsuburban back streets (Barry was\nmap reading), two weary tennis\nplayers were sitting in a traffic jam\nsomewhere in the vicinity of the\nairport. Consequently, on arriving\nat Gardens LT C we were\nconfronted with vast opposition of\ntwo, their first couple.\nBravely, Sara and Tony took to\nthe tennis court, and with hard\nhitting and some good shots,\nwhich surprised everyone (both of\nus), beat them convincingly 6-1,\n6-1. The second couple had not\nturned up, so Barry and Julia went\nto play the first couple, they\nzoomed to a31 lead and then\npro ceded to lose 3-6, 1-6.\nMeanwhile, the second couple\narrived, and played Tony and Sara. Having been sitting around\nfor a while we had become bored\nof tennis, so we had a little\ncompetition instead. We decided\nto see which of us could hit the\nball furthest away from the tennis\ncourt. I can't say who won because it was pretty close, but\nwe lost the ten nis 5-7,2-6. We then\nretired to the bar, somewhat\nannoyed, while Barry and Julia\ntook on the second pair. They\nthen started their tennis match.\nThey lost the first set 1-6, and did\nnot finish the second, as we had\nlost overall.\nBarry and Julia joined us in the\nbar, where, not content with\nlosing a tennis match. Tony fed as\nmuch money as he could to the\nfruit machine. Barry suggested\nthat we should play a friendly\nmatch against them sometime,\nalthough I thought we'd been\nquite nice this time.\nThe Team: Barry Witts and Julia\nTowns, and Tony Tsoukkas and\nSara McGuinness\nGROSS COUNTRY All Stars Make Final Appearence\nOn Wednesday 23rd May the Cross Country Club's stalwarts grouped\ntogether for their final race for the college. They were joined on this\nauspicious occasion by some 'past' members of the Club.\nThe venue for the race was the National Westminster Bank Sports\nGround at Norbury. The race, the National Westminster Bank Relays - a much smaller version of our own world-famous Hyde Park Road Relay.\nThe College team suffered slightly form lack of speed due to a clash\nwith the UL games - that annual sporting d is organisation perpetrated at\nMostpur Park. However, Mark 'long distance' Pickard got his priorities\nright and after competing in the walk at the games travelled to Norbury\nfor the main event of the day.\nThe race was won by a team\nfrom GEC, with the organisers Nat\nWest second. Third were Barclays\nand we crept in 4th. Individually the performances\nwent something like this. The first\nteam was led off at a blistering\npace by Stu Littlewood who returned in third place. BRyan\nAcford took over and was soon\novercome by the occasion and\npeople zipped past him. Mark'\nPickard slowed the rot and\nreturned at the end of the third leg\nin 7th. Steve Webb on the final\nfourth leg pulled the team into\nfourth place, but saw nothing of\nthe first three runners who had\nfinished some minutes before.\nSo much for the first team. The\nsecond team comprised a mixture\nof past and present and the third\nteam allowed the more fit their\nsecond run of the evening. The second team of ;lan Isherwood,\nMicky Fuller, Stu 'The Ox' Graham\nand Maurice Wilson, finished in\n8th place. On their way to this\nposition they showed remarkable\nconsistency and even gave the\nfirst team a nasty moment when at\nthe end of the third leg they had\nedged ahead of them. This only\nlasted for 440 yards (400m for\nthose who have gone metric).\nThe third team saw the return to\njogging of Ian Alvey and Mark\nSykes. Mark Pickard and Stu\nLittlewood finished the team off\nwith their second laps of the\nevening.\nWell that's all folks, same place\nnext year!\nIan Alvey\nSara McGuinness\n64th London University\nAthletic Championships\nLast Wednesday eight magnificent specimens of IC manhood\n(Joined later by one Gary Longhurst and a certain Chris Ridermore of whom later) rattled along to Motspur Park in a bid to\nemulate the win by IC last year in the UL Athletic\nChampionships.\nOn arrival, Pete Barry began to allocate half-a dozen or so\nextra events to each athlete to ensure that we gave the\nimpression of having a full team (and to alleviate boredom).\nThis was achieved mostly on the toss of a coin! Then the team\nbegan their el labor ate psyching out routine, consisting of\nactually warming up before the events, and occasionally\nrunning, jumping and throwing large metal objects.\nEventually, after the mandatory hour's delay, the games\nbegan with IC immediately making their mark due to 2nd places\nfrom Ian Morton (2km steeple chase) and Longhurst (800m). But this was only the first course, as Mike Weiner demolished\nthe rest of the hammer field with a40m throw, 17m further than\nIan Roberts (also IC) who was 2nd. With Barry, Dave Rosen and Dave Jones giving everything\n(with little reward) in numerous events, but still accumulating\nvaluable points, IC were not disgraced on the track, but it was in\nthe field events where the p pints were really mounting up. Chris\nRider won a fine discus competition, with A Kruszewski 3rd, Roberts was runner-up in the pole vault and 3rd in the javelin,\nand Hewkin was 3rd in the shot putt; this gave IC a good lead in\nthe men's competition.\nThe championship was put beyond doubt when Longhurst\nwon a marvellous 400m hurdles and Morton came second in the\n1500m, and IC duly pro ceded to the officials enclosure only to\nbe told that there was no cup.\n- It had disappeared some years earlier! Oh, well you win\nsome\nSigned,\nThe Shot Putter\n\n"

She still found movement difficult and painful: the sores left by the stic he s in her stomach would take another four or five weeks to heal properly. At any rate,\nthe physical pain was a welcome distraction from the spiritual void which had lately engulfed her soul. Even now, she stubbornly refused to be seduced by the insouciant atmosphere which pervaded the A egan Isle. She repulsed too the soothing embrace of the Greek sunshine, which gave her the vapour s. She lit another cigarette, then immediately stubbed it out. God! How she\nabhorred Greek tobacco! She was alone. Peter had gone swimming with some Monsieur s et\nMe dames he had met in their hotel. She preferred her solitude to their loathe some company. Indeed, the very sight of people, especially children, galled her. For the brutal repercussion of her operation was a poignant reminder, like a never present shadow, of her two beloved, absent daughters Jade and Augustine. At times, she felt as if she was peering over the edge of some yawning abyss. Then a voice inside her would whisper beseeching ly... 'Look away, lest you fall.' And she would\nglance away, only lo behold an eternity of desert, arid and desolate.\nAt thirty-live, her gaunt features already betrayed the anxieties and dissipation s of\nher immoderate v out h. How could she have been so irresponsible! Her children\nneeded her. their mother. In whose arms were they now? Some Circe with whom her\nex-husband had become momentarily en fatu a ted? What demon had possessed her to\nconcede sole custody to him? Her mind recoiled from the Rhadamantine reasoning of\nher conscience. No longer could her amour-passion for Peter viel the mortification she\nnow felt at deserting her children, her destiny.\nHow far back these rabid thoughts had led her by the hand. All the while she had\nlain motionless ly in bed, nervously fingering a string of worry-beads. Following some\ncaprice, she dressed hurriedly. Within a minute, the door slammed noisily behind her.\nTo avoid the milling crowds, she left the hotel by the back entrance. Then, with\ndowncast eyes, she made her way towards a quaint tavern a she knew on the outskirts of\nthe village. In her self-preoccupation, she barely noticed a near-fatal collision between\na pedestrian and a car which had occurred almost right before her eyes.\nJust then, she stopped. A child, a small\nGreek girl, with dishevelled auburn hair,\nplaintive eyes, and a grubby, bronzed face,\nbarred her way. The child communicated\nher needs by a series of gestures - Sue thought\nperhaps that she was dumb. She rubbed her\nstomach, pointed to her open mouth, then\nearnestly stretched forth her hand. As Sue\ndelved into her bag, the girl repeated the\nseries of gestures again and again. Unfortunately, Sue had left her room in such\nhaste that she had forgotten to pick up her\npurse. She felt chagrined : she dearly wanted\nto give the child something, especially as she\nresembled her own Augustine. In the midst ol\nher quandary, Sue espied a gorgeous red\nflower blooming miraculously amidst the\nrefuse in the gutter. Arousing the keen\ncuriosity of her friendly assailant, she stooped\nawkwardly to pluck it.\nAs she presented the child with the flower,\nac com pain i ed by a broad, almost pitiful\nsmile, the girl's cherub in e features become\nflushed with anger.\nSnapping the stork ofthe flower in two, the\nungrateful girl threw it away in disgust, then\nran off to join her friends who had watched\nthe incident from near-by.\nThis trivial encounter touched the gentle\nlady's heart to the quick. As tears of wot:\nburnt her cheeks, she sat down by the curb-side, with the childrens' mocking laughter\nringing in her ears. For an hour or more she\nremained there, with her head slumped\nwearily between her knees, staring fixedly\ndown into that precipice oi doom.\nSpontaneously, a series of images welled up\nbefore her...she saw herself standing with her\nchildren on the edge of the chasm.\nThen she knelt down, made the sign of the\ncross, and turning to Augustine with a twisted half-smile, violently pushed her into\nthe gorge. As she heard the sound of her\ndaughter's hideous scream die down in her\nears, someone tapped her lightly on the\nshoulder...\n'Leave me alone,' she moaned, still swooning\nIrom the vividness of her macabre vision.\n'Mummy, mummy, why are you kneeling?' asked\na familiar voice.\n'Oh! Jade, my darling!' Sue cried ecstatically. 'And Augustine, you're alive!'\nHugging her daughters to her heaving breast,\nshe smothered the rn in kisses ol rapturous joy.\n'.Susan, are you all right?' inquired a deep,\nsonorous voice Irom the past. In vain, Susan\ntried to regain her equanimity. She just\nmanaged to return her ex-husband's greeting\nwith a thin smile.\nAghast at the connivance s of late, they\ngazed silently at each other.\n'It's uncanny,' Peter exclaimed. 'Andyou've\nasked him lo come here! To our hotel room. What\naudacity! Susan, haven't you come down from the\nmorphine injections they gave you in the hospital? I have no wish to see Virgil...1 refuse outright!' Peter\nthundered, bringing his fist down on the table\nto emphasise the vehemence of his taunting\nwords. 'And I forbid vo u lo see him either!' he\nadded, his eyes ablaze with jealousy-Sue, for once unperturbed by her\nhusband's sarcastic remonstrances, announced with that calm deliberation ol\nwhich only women are capable.\nTf> are all to be re-united.' The young man\nbroke into a scornful laugh.\n'Just what makes you think..'\n'He's bringing the children,' Sue interrupted.\n'I'm sorry., but I'm still bewildered .in God's name, it hat difference does that make? A re they some\nkind of talisman, do they magically transform mens\nlives by their mere presence? Tell me...I'm waiting.'\nPeter jeered, folding his arms in a gesture of\nimpatience.\n' You know you are endeared to them Peter.\nWhy do you act out this pantomime of indifference?\nDon't you remember how we three began?'\n'Yes I do. You and Virgil corrupted an innocent,\nguileless specimen of nineteen.'\n'Corrupted indeed, Sue rejoinder ed in a teasing tone. 'Peter, none of us were exactly angels\nof virtue.'\n'.Xo well. I should never have accepted such a portentous invitation', Peter remarked, recalling\nthe events of some six years ago.\n'Virgil and I didn't know what would become of\nit. Troilism is not a common practice... in one sense,\nwe were as naive as you.. .perhaps more so. For il was\nour joint decision to form a menage al ro is... it was\nlike administering hemlock to the lips of our\nmarra ige,' Sue added as an after-thought.\n'An enchanting simile...but you're right.\nTroilism transgresses the very ethnic al fabric of\nsociety : hence its fascination,' Peter continued\nphilosophically. 'Hut wait. What have Augustine\nand Jade lo do with all this? by the way, how are\nthey?'\n'Peter. Sit down,' Sue ordered tersely.\n'What.'\n'Sit down, please. Here, next to me,' Peter\nobeyed his wile's edict, sensing the ominous\nchange in her tone of voice. After ab riel silence, Sue proclaimed, 'Peter, you are a father.'\n'Yes I know', he answered, his voice tinged\nwith an admixture of pride and disappointment.\nWo I don't mean by thai whore woman Lucy.'\n'...then with..what..whom?..how?' Peter was\nas confused as he sounded.\n'You are the father of my youngest daughter\nAugustine.' Susan looked her husband straight\nin the eye.\n'Is it possible? How - wail - are you sure?' Peter\nransacked the recesses of his memory lor\nevidence to confirm this astounding\nrevelation.\n'Without doubt,' Sue assured him. Speechless with emotion, Peter embraced his\nwile...the only woman he had ever known\nwhom he had wanted to bear his child.\n'Oh! Mind my stomach...it's still extremely\nlender'. Sue exclaimed.\nAt that moment, there was a knock at the\ndoor\nBy - Justin Newland\nWritten and conceived May'79 "

However, because Worcestershire\nneeded not only to win but to improve their\noverall wicket rate, Brian Rose's action\neffectively guaranteed Somerset' s qualification into a profitable quarter-final\nstage.\nHis ungentlemanly tactics effectively\nhampered Glamorgan who just failed to\nqualify. Mr Rose exploited a loophole that\nnowhere in the rules is the condition stating\nthat both sides should do their best to win the\ngame. The very essence of cricket is that a rule such as that should never have to be\nwritten down.\nLay by Day\nJournalists writing forthe Royal College of\nScience magazine, Broadsheet, began a rival\nreview of the week's news at Imperial College.\nThis follows the enlargement of Peterborough's 'London Day by Day' column\nin The Daily Telegraph.\nThe President of the 'Ban out of date news\ncampaign', Mr J Allenbury, was interviewed\nduring a Radio London publicity campaign.\n(206 metres MW. 1458 KHZ,94.9 VHF. free Stickers available from IC Radio).

Each insect delivered alive\nfor research will earn a5p donation for\ncharities supporting the International Year of\nthe Child.\nThe suggested \"hunting\" technique is to\nmake traps from jam jars wrapped in brown\npaper, rough side out, to enable cockroaches\nto climb the sides.

However, a romping, dancing, tartan, skinhead intruder\nwho spent three minutes eluding the clutches\nof five panting policemen, not to mention a finger-wagging, Portuguese referee wearing\na shocking pink uniform, did the Wembley\nInternational no favours at all. In the time\nadded on for the intruder's presence, Peter\nBarnes, with a slow, wriggling shot, put\nEngland back in the game.\nEngland took control of the second half\nwith goals from Coppell and Keegan.\nSunday 27th Fish market moves down river\nFor more than 1,000 years Billingsgate has\nbeen the home of London's fish trade.

    "content": "Issue No. 520 Friday, 1st June, 1979\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nSabbaticals\nto Pay Tax?\nStudent Unions will have to pay the Government at least \u00a3700 for each\nof their sabbatical officers following a ruling by the Department of\nHealth and Social Security in April.\nWith four sabbaticals IC Union will have to find another \u00a33000 per\nyear at a time when the College has already forced the Union to cut its\nbudget next year.\nThe money will go to cover national insurance contributions and\nincome tax, both of which have up to now been ignored by Student\nUnions.\nThe DHS S have ruled that sabbaticals are employees of the Union\nand therefore national insurance at the rates of 6.5 per cent employee's contribution and 13.5 per cent employer's contribution has to be paid.\nThe order is effective from 6th April 1979.\nThe snag is that to pay the from him. This could amount to\nnational insurance Unions must\ninform the Tax Inspector and will\ntherefore no longer be able to get\naway without paying income tax.\nAlthough a few Unions have\npaid income tax, including the\nNational Union of Students, most\nhave never done so and the Inland\nRevenue have not until now been\naware of the anomalous status of\nstudent sabbaticals.\nSo that an IC Union sabbatical\ncan continue to receive a net\nsalary of \u00a31,990 (1978-79 rate), the\nUnion will have to pay a gross\nsalary of \u00a32,390 of which the\nadditional \u00a3400 covers national\ninsurance at 6.5 per cent and\nincome tax over the two tax years\nwhich the sabbatical term of office\nspans. Added to this is the\nemployer's contribution of \u00a3323\ngiving over \u00a3700 at 1978-79 rates.\nThe sum is likely to go up as\nsabbatical salaries increase.\nThe sabbatical officer himself\ncould however gain, provided he\ndoes not get a job as soon as he\nleaves office. For as long as he\nremains a student or unemployed\nhe can claim back any tax paid by\nthe Union on his behalf in the\ncurrent tax year, and there is no\nway the Union can get this money\n\u00a3110 tax paid in the last 3 months\nof his office.\nBut if he enters immediate\nemployment he may be worse off\nthan an 'ordinary' student as he\nwill have'used up'some of his tax-free allowance.\nThe new situation will also\naffect the position of any overseas\nstudent who gets elected to a sabbatical post. To take up office\nsuch students will now need work\npermits. The NUS have in the past\nhad an agreement with the Home\nOffice allowing overseas students\nto be sabbatical officers and they\nhave promised to approach the\nHome Office again if any problems arise.\nBecause IC Union is outside\nNUS the Union have not received\nfull details ofthe DHS S ruling and\nhave not yet been able to consider\nwhere this extra cash is to come\nfrom. In the new circumstances\nperhaps College will be able to\nincrease the Union's grant to\ncover this unexpected additional\nexpenditure. After all College will\nhardly wish to force the Union or\nits student employees to do\nanything illegal like evading tax\nand national insurance payments.\nAbove: Lord b loiters and Mr Freddie Webber\nBelow: Colonel Mae on the Thames\nNEW BOAT CLUB FOUR S Imperial College Boat Club proudly launched their new pair\nof fours on Wednesday. The Rector, Lord Flowers, poured\nChampagne over the cox less four named Freddie Webber.\nLady Flowers christened the cox ed four Colonel Mac. Mr Webber and Lt ColM cLe ll an were present to watch the ceremony. Freddie was Captain of boats a year before Lord Flowers was born. The Rector commented that it was a bit different today compared with what Freddie was used to in those days, Both fours have already been rowed in competitions. The cox ed four, Colonel Mac, has won eight\nout of its last ten races. The official launching was postponed until the summer and they were rewarded with a line afternoon. The Imperial College coat of arms attached to the side of the boat by a transfer process, has caused a small problem for the club because the li rst set of\ntransfers came off.

This event, organised by the army and\nentered by about two and a half thousand walkers, is not a race\nbut a test of physical endurance and the ability to map read\nround a basically featureless moor.\nTeams walk as sixes and must be correctly equipped before being\nallowed to start, all part of the rigorous schedule that has to be\ncompleted on the Friday night. Should walkers be lost through injury,\nexposure or exhaustion the team may only continue if four or more\nmembers still remain, if not they must join up with another party on\ntheir route. This is all part ofthe safety precautions necessary to survive\nthe potential hazards of the moor. The courses are 35, 45 and 55 miles\nlong.\nIn the past RCS had only\nlimited success - the l st year\n(1976). the ladies only reached the\nthird Tor. and the men, slowed by\n2 injuries, were crashed out at the\npenultimate Tor. In 1977 a single\nmens' team completed the '55'\nwith the loss of two. Last year the\nladies, however, excelled and\ncompleted the '35'.\nThis year was unbelievable in\nits outcome. The weather was\nbeautiful all the way, which made\nfor dry throats, boiling feet and\nwet backs. Apart from that we\ncould not have asked lor more!\nThe Ladies team, led by Helen\nmade a cracking repetition of\ntheir last year's success.\nTheir performance was outstanding on their 35 mile\nroute. Despite very difficult\nconditions they reached and\ncamped at their 8th Tor by the\nend of the first day. They\ncontinued their course the next\nday in as good form, arriving\ntriumphantly back in Oke hampton at 12.40 as a complete\nteam. This was more than 4 hours\nbefore the allocated time, and as\nsuch they deserve every recognition and commendations.\nThe team was: Helen Grogan,\nJulia Towns, Liz Kay, Hilary\nCarter, Averil Horton, Sunila\nNimalasuriya.\nThe Men's team was really up\nagainst it. Our route involved a lot of tricky map reading around\nrestricted areas, the penalty for\nstraying into these being disqualification. Although the'\nroute was 55 miles as the crow\nflies, the distance walked was\nupwards of 70 miles. Things went.\nfine for the first half hour, we\nreached the first Tor and set off\npretty fast for the second. The\nteam was not yet established and\neveryone was having his little say\nas to where to go and what to do.\nThe result was that a democratically formed decision\ntook us both ways through\nGidleigh Common, the most\nnotorious bog on the moor,\nBy Saturday night, 6.30, we\nhad reached the fifth Tor and\nhad to camp by the sixth to have\nany hope of finishing. Things had\ngot pretty tough for everyone by\nthat stage and the prospect of a further 3.25 hrs march was not\nunanimously looked forward to,\nhowever we set off and even Neil didn't like it! By 9.30 the sun had\nset and the cold began to get\nthrough. We had got to the slag\nheap, which, fortunately, was on\nthe same bearing as the Tor but\nnot actually what we thought it\nwas! Afte: some fifteen minutes\ndiscussion as to where we were\nand where the Tor was with a couple of equally bewildered\nRAF teams we set off again. After\nhalf a mile we were pretty well\nfinished, the Tor was a good mile\naway and we were within a few\nhundred yards of not walking any\nfurther. We reached a river,\ndropped everything & that was it\nfor Saturday. About 40 miles\nbehind us and 30 to go, but with\nNeil's stew, five cups of tea and a blissfully warm sleeping bag in\nbetween.\nFox started up a relentless hail\nof abuse at 4.15 which continued\nuntil 4.40, no one was allowed\nbreakfast until his tent was down,\nboots on and all but teeth cleaned,\nbut it worked and we were ol f again at 5.10am. The next two\nstretches we belted, doing the 12\nmiles in 2 hours 25 mins. This put\nus in a good position to tackle the\nremaining 3 tors. It did not,\nhowever, alter the impending\nproblems of performing said\nmarch. It is not really within my\nability to describe the last\neighteen to twenty miles without\nsounding melodramatic and\npossibly ridiculous. It was the\nmost punishing experience I have\never had and one I don't think I would wish to repeat. It was\nthrough Chris's leadership and\nMichael's example, that we made\nit, but everyone played a part,\nDave for his fine front walking\nand map reading. Mo for making\nme feel that if he could suffer his\nfeet then so could I, and Neil lor\nhis excellent performance as\nmother and his fine example of\nwhat 24 hour cycling marathons\ncan do for you on Ten Tors.\nWe made it in by 3.45, the\nfourth complete team ofthe 20 on\nour route and in the middle of the\nRAF teams. What made this\npossible, because it was really\nquite ridiculous that we should\nhave done it at all, was the fact\nthat the team was one.\nRSM\nFor the unfortunates who are\nnot members of Mines Union and\nfor those who are but couldn't/ didn't go to the last two Union\nMeetings, the following people\nare next session's Union Officers.\nPresident Chris Sleap (GIT)\nVice Pres Trev Fletcher\nHon Sec Bernie Pryor\nEnts Officer Stu Vine\nHJT Annabel Thorn\nA AO Pete Bamford\nSports Officer . . . .

Profits estimates\nare put at between \u00a35,000 and \u00a38,000.\nThe authorised capital of the Company is \u00a324,000 (are you getting\nbored?) of which \u00a310,000 is issued, \u00a35,000 being held by Exchange\nTravel and \u00a31,000 by Imperial College Union.\nEconomics is a closed book to many, especially when they think in\nterms of the \u00a340 a week that comes from their grant cheque. \u00a3560,000 (it\nis slightly more comprehensible to me than \u00a30.56m) is one heck of a lot\nof money, until you start looking at, say BP'S profits (\u00a3444.4m) or\nUnilever's first quarter sales (\u00a32,585m). One week's reading the\nFinancial Times is enough to make anybody wonder where all the\nmoney gets to. The problem is that money keeps going round and round\nin circles and turnover figures signpost part of the direction in which it\nwas travelling.\nHaving said that, profits are the part of the turnover which, at any\nparticular time, belongs to the company which is creating that turnover.\nThough I do not wish to indulge in a full-blooded capitalist apologia I will point out that profits rarely 'belong' for long but get passed on to\nshareholders (who spend it) or spent by the company in order that it will make a profit the next year. (Note, if you want to speed the revolution the\nbest way is to do the supremely capitalist thing, ie light your cigarettes,\ngas rings or other fires with \u00a320 notes!)\nTo make profits it is required to employ capital. It is very unusual for a company to be required to pay cash for any goods or services it requires\nbut it will not get those things unless the supplier thinks it will get paid.\nThe supplier must see that Capital exists to pay the bill sometime or it\nwill not supply. However, the rate of return on capital is important, it is\nundesirable for this return to be low.\nWhich brings me to another boring figure, Return on Capital\nEmployed, 50-80%. This is a truly amazing figure and can only be\nachieved because the Company is small. However as with ail young\ncompanies L ST is under-capitalized.\nOf the \u00a314,000 of unused capital Exchange Travel has first option on\n\u00a37,000. This is a travel company owned by a highly respected but mildly\neccentric travel salesman called George McNally who, on one occasion,\nmarched up and down on the British side of the bridge connecting\nGibraltor and Spain carrying a Union Flag in a rather unsubtle attempt\nto get the Spanish authorities to allow travel across it.\nIn a singularly uncharacteristic action, for which we are eternally\ngrateful, he agreed to match, pound for pound, any capital put up by\nstudent Unions for L ST up to a total of \u00a324,000 (ie he would commit\n\u00a312,000). Let there be no doubt about it, this is a good thing, it makes\nany capital that we contribute much more effective. However L ST needs\nmore.\nThe capital is used to provide bonds, that is sums of money made over\nto our suppliers as a guarantee that we will pay them for any services\nthey supply us. (I have started identifying with L ST so us, our and we\nmeans the Company in various senses, however, to confuse you, it\nmight mean ICU occasionally). The Company deals in selling journey\ntickets for air, rail and ferry trips, both to students in London and to\nother Student Travel Bureaux, as well as some inclusive or package\nholidays. It has considerable scope for expansion in every field in which\nit operates, a fact which is recognised by other companies who have\napproached L ST with an aim to providing capital. These have been\nturned down.\nOf course, most shareholders look for a return or dividend on their\ninvestment. Again, I do not wish to indulge in a diatribe on the subject of\nthe value of our shareholding in a Company which provides a service to\nour (ICU's) members which they like to have, which is reliable and\nwhich may be more convenient supplied in that way. It is a charge that is\nlevelled against L ST quite often that their products are not particularly\ncheap. We (LST) attempt to sell products (air flights, holidays) that give\nvalue-for-money, where, barring air-traffic controllers'strikes, if a ticket\nis bought a seat will be reserved and the flight will occur. L ST is not a bucket shop. Cheaper products might be possible if turnover increases\nand profits rise. Anyway, L ST has no intention at the moment to declare\na dividend.\nThe return on \u00a310,000 invested in a Building Society would be about\n\u00a3800 (in BP it would be about \u00a3350). Therefore it is possible to argue that\nsince this is between about 16% and 10% of estimated profits it is not\nexcessive. It means our dividend cover would be between 6 and 10\n(Total profits/Total dividends) which is highly respectable (as indeed is\na yield of 8%). However the capital needs of our company is such that\nour profits may well be much better employed as retained earnings.\nThere is an argument that some kind of definite return will encourage\nmany of the student unions who have not invested in L ST to do so. But\nstudent unions care little about good investment strategies as shown\nby, (a) the fact that shares in L ST are being offered on a ridiculously low\nP/E( Price of share / Earnings per share - between 2 and 1.25) (b) Student Unions, as charities, invest in Building Societies anyway.\nA rapid scan through the Financial Times will show there are few\ncompanies whose shares can be obtained on such a low P/E and as\ncharities student unions can get gross returns on their investments\nwhile Building Society interest is paid net.\nAn alternative to giving a dividend is to give a scrip issue. At say, 1 for\n10 this would mean that ICU had \u00a31100 invested in LST, (instead of\n\u00a31000) an apparent return of 10%, while the actual money is retained as\nCapital by the Company. However, this would increase Exchange\nTravel's, holding by \u00a3500 without them actually putting up any cash so it\nwould deprive L ST of \u00a3500 of their money, perhaps an agreement\ncould be reached to modify this unsatisfactory effect.\nIn the meantime, contribute to LST's profitability by booking your\nholiday through the Campus Office.\nChristopher D Hunt\nGAYSOC\nPeople who are leaving college at the end of this term, and anyone who is nervous about involving themselves in the college GAY SO C,an dI know the feeling from personal experience, may find the following organisations helpful: Gay Switchboard: 0 1 - 8 3 7 7 3 2 4 .
