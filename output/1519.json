The findings also appear to suggest that sexual selection can still be at work in a society where the\nmarriage system is strictly monogamous.\nThis is in stark contrast to the traditional\nview, held by many evolutionary psychologists\nand social scientists, that selective pressures\nin human evolution have been significantly\nweakened \u2013 if not put on hold entirely \u2013 by the\nflexibility our species gained through social\nand cultural adaptations.\nThe researchers also found that evolutionary rates varied between men and women.\nThough individuals in the population were\nassumed to maintain monogamous relation-ships, men were more likely to remarry after the death of a spouse, exposing them to\nHumans are still evolving\nFELIX\nFriday 25 may 2012\n10\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nSCIENCE\nIn brief\nResearchers at Disney and Carnegie Mellon University have published new research which could\nmake everyday objects and even the human body\ninto a touchscreen.\nThis could mean traditional interfaces would\nno longer be needed, as smartphones could be\nsilenced by holding a finger to the lips, and the\nvolume on mp3 players could be controlled with\na tap of the hand.\nThe technology, known as Touch\u00e9, uses Swept\nFrequency Capacitive Sensing, which is similar\nto the technology used in smartphone screens.\nSmartphones only detect electrical signals on\none frequency, allowing them to know when they\nare being touched. Touch\u00e9 takes this one step\nfurther by using a range of frequencies, so objects not only detect touch, but \u2018sense\u2019 how they\nare being touched.\nEveryday objects can be equipped with the new\ntechnology by attaching only one electrode. \u201cIt\ncould immediately be used to create new and exciting ways for people to interact with objects and\nthe world at large,\u201d says Ivan Poupyrev, senior\nresearch scientist at Disney Research.\nThe researchers envision a Touch\u00e9-equipped\nhome where the television is turned on when the\nuser sits down on the sofa. The lights automatically dim when the user leans back to enjoy the\nshow, and if they fall asleep, the room darkens\nand the television is turned off.\nThe research, presented at the Conference on\nHuman Factors in Computing Systems in Texas,\ninvestigated how this could be used in existing\ntablet computers. Depending on which fingers\nwere used to touch the screen, and whether a\n\u2018pinch\u2019 or \u2018grasp\u2019 motion was used, the computer\ncould perform different functions, such as zooming in or right-clicking. Touch\u00e9 technology can\nalso be applied to liquids, detecting whether one\nfinger or a whole hand is submerged in a container of water.\nBy wearing electrode on the wrists in a similar\nway to watches, smartphones, mp3 players and\ncomputers could all become gesture-controlled.\n\u201cThis might enable us to one day do away with\nkeyboards, mice and perhaps even conventional\ntouchscreens for many applications,\u201d says Munehiko Sato, a PhD student involved in the work.\nDisney is also conducting research into how\nliving plants can be made into surround sound\nsystems for use in their theme parks.\nSiobhan Chan\nDisney want to make all the world\na touchscreen\nslightly greater sexual competition on average over their lifetimes.\nHowever, selection seems to have been indifferent to social status. \u201cSurprisingly,\u201d says\nLummaa, \u201cselection affected wealthy and poor\npeople in the society to the same extent.\u201d Yet\nanother thing that money can\u2019t buy?\nDOI: 10.1073/pnas.1118174109\nDouglas Heaven\nA new study has identified three key proteins\nin plants that may help the development of\nimproved crops yielding higher qualities and\nquantities of oils. The scientists, of the Salk\nInstitute for Biological Studies and Iowa\nState University, say that such plants could\nhelp to reduce the growing global demand for\nfood and fuels, and negate the detrimental effect such demand may have on our environment and ecosystems.\nThe research, headed by lead authors Joseph Noel and Eve Syrkin Wurtele, analysed genomic plant data and pinpointed the\nproteins responsible for regulating the metabolism of fatty acids in thale cress plants.\nThese three proteins, dubbed FAP1, FAP2\nand FAP3, control the molecular pathways\nresponsible for plant oil production and bind\nfatty acids such as omega-3.\n\u201cThis work has major implications for\nmodulating the fatty acid profiles of plants,\u201d\nsays lead author Joseph Noel. The researchers found that altering the expression of these\nproteins changed the amount and quality of\nplant oil produced via these pathways.\nPlant oils are triglycerides and are stored\nin seeds. They consist of three linked fatty\nacids, which are very high-energy molecules\nformed in a plant using solar energy. Utilising these acids could therefore provide a very\nefficient method for producing biorenewable\nchemicals and fuels. This would help to alleviate fears over petroleum security and\nglobal climate change, as well as aiding international industry, nutrition and transport.\nFAP1, 2 and 3 are linked ancestrally to\nTrio of proteins to ease food demand\nenzymes that control flavonoid production,\ncompounds that play many roles within a\nplant and have great nutritional and health\nbenefits in human diets. Further study of\nplant proteins may result in a greater understanding of how proteins evolve into en-zymes, a mechanism that has huge industrial\npromise.\nDOI:10.1038/nature11009\nNicola Guttridge\nTree or surround sound system?\nThe internet is potentially making huge strides in changing the way we think\nPart of the ribbon diagram for an X-ray crystal structure\nNature\n\n"

He started\nout as free jazz drummer\nin his native country before moving to guitar,\nwhich he plays experimentally and unconven-tionally, producing sounds alien to traditional\nmusic.\nHis music is of a consistently high quality\nand he puts out an amazing amount of collabo-rations, with people as respected as Sunn 0))).\nHe has a simply huge discography, with more\nthan 3 releases this year so far and an album\nwith Sunn 0)))\u2019s Steven O\u2019Malley and Keiji\nHaino in production. While I admit his regular\noutput is often a challenge to keep up with, he\nrarely lets the quality slip and has an outstanding range.\nThe logical starting point is the only solo\nwork released this year, Audience Of One.\nWhat surprised me about it was the prevalence\nof vocals on the first track. I have to admit that\nthat from the opening of \u2018Salt\u2019 I was puzzled,\neven disappointed. On further listens, how-ever, I realised that it was both relaxing and\nresonant, if a little lacking in experimentation.\nThe same could be said for the last two tracks,\nwhich are interlinked and contain some conventional use of acoustic guitar over ambient\nsoundscapes. If all this sounds like a quaint\nambient album, it\u2019s because I haven\u2019t mentioned the second track. As nice as the pieces are, the main event is the 33 minute cen-trepiece \u2018Knots\u2019, which is a noise rock/drone/\nfree jazz/hard to define piece, and one which\ndoesn\u2019t disappoint. It\u2019s very hard to describe\nbecause it is a persistently evolving musical journey, starting ambient, with a beat that\nslowly speeds up, building in intensity, until it\ndrops out, leaving a more empty soundscape\nled by metallic sounds.\nThe second album is a collaboration with\nSwedish free jazz band Fire! entitled In The\nMouth a Hand. Fire! are a super group of sorts,\nas all of the trio have made their names in\nother projects. They are signed to the Norwegian Rune Grammofon label, and are masters\nof creating hypnotic platforms for the buildup of intensity, at once ominous and reflec-tive. It must be said that the album is closer\nto Fire!\u2019s natural style than Ambarchi\u2019s and in\nfact, on the first listen I struggled to work out\nwhat exactly Ambarchi did on the album. He\nis credited as playing guitar, but as touched on\nabove, he makes sounds that little resemble the\ntraditional guitar. On further listens it became\nclear what his role was. The album is one of\nthose brilliantly layered albums where the\nlistener notices new elements on every listen\nand this subtlety is due to Ambarchi, with a\nwide array of effected tones and various ambient sounds. This is unlike a lot of free jazz\nin that is doesn\u2019t stop and restart threateningly\nloud. Fire!\u2019s rhythm section maintain hypnotic\nrhythms giving these songs the impression of\nslow burners, which gradually rise and fall\nwith their own momentum. It is not bereft of\nintense moments though, as Fire!\u2019s trumpetist\nand Ambarchi\u2019s noises often combine to great\neffect to provide claustrophobia, even within\nsuch an expansive sound.\nLive collaboration with Keiji Haino and\nJim O\u2019Rourke, Imikuzushi, completes the\nset with the most extreme of the offerings.\nThe first track is a statement of intent, from\n0.01 going straight for the jugular with some\nballs-to-the-wall, blistering noise rock, which\neventually settles down to a steady rhythm\nwith recognisable instruments but still noisy\nguitar. Oren Ambarchi returns to his original\ninstrument, the drums, and links up well with\nO\u2019Rourke, who plays bass on this album. Later tracks settle down to a more conventional\nstyle, still intense and building, and this album\nis definitely a notable departure from their\nearlier works, where the music could often be\nan interminable mass. This sounds more like\nBoris on an acid trip gone bad. A further departure is that this really sounds like a Haino\nproject as he plays the guitar and does vocals.\nA highlight for me is the third track, which\nstarts of muted and ambient, a soundscape imbued with haunted beauty until after 8 minutes\nis drops into a normal beat, which I can\u2019t help\nbut interpret as a nod to Krautrock. Album of\nthe year so far.\nWhile the order I\u2019ve reviewed them in seems\nto suggest ascending quality (and does to me),\nI hasten to add that it\u2019s almost not applicable,\nbecause each album has a different scope of\nmoods, and caters to a different musical whim:\nO. Ambarchi: an introduction\nRiazAgahigoesdeep on threeof this year\u2019s offerings\nAlthough they have often used larger set ups, Hella, at its barebones, is guitarist Spencer Seim and\ndrummer extraordinaire Zach Hill, who have played\ntogether since high school. They released their first\nEP\n, Leather Diamond, in 2001. Even in that early\nrelease, the Sacramento, California band have a\ndistinctive tone, consisting of technical, breakneck\nriffs and outstanding drum performances from Hill.\nZach Hill\u2019s drumming talents are utilised on\na plethora of other projects, such as work with\nOrthrelm\u2019s Mick Barr, or trending experimental hiphop group Death Grips. Seim also has a solo project and Nintendo cover band The Advantage.\nHella have been branded noise rock, but I disagree with this label. While their music can have\na chaotic air to it, Seim\u2019s guitar often flirts with\nmelody. Slow it down and make it 4/4 and it could\nbe the makings of some standard indie. The importance of polyrhythyms sets Hella apart as math\nrock, or a noise rock/math rock crossover. Experimental rock is perhaps another tag that may be\napplicable because Hella have never shied away\nfrom experimenting.\nIndeed, primarily an instrumental group, they\nincluded vocals from friend Dan Elkan on certain\ntracks in early EPs, and from Aaron Ross on 2006\u2019s\nThere\u2019s No 666 In Outer Space. Use of vocals does\nlittle to mellow their music or blunt the band\u2019s\nsense of experimentalism as while this album\ndoes contain some of their most accessible songs,\nit also has some of their most experimental work,\nwhere vocals merely add to the psychedelic blur of\nthe instruments. Their music has also been known\nto include elements of other genres such as 8-bit\nand dance, shown by working with synths and a\nsplit with Four Tet. The culmination of their experiments was the 2005 double album Church Gone\nWild/Chirpin Hard, two independently recorded solo\nalbums from Hill and Seim respectively, Hill making\na noise rock release and Seim going in a 8-bit/\npunk/math rock fusion direction.\nHella continue to produce quality music, releasing their latest album, Tripper, last year, once again\nas a duo. As in the past, they created yet another\nphysically exhausting album, at once aggressive\nand catchy, with a groove running through the majority of the songs, resembling a less noisy Lightning Bolt. In contrast to the above albums, Tripper\ntakes a restrained approach, with a sound that is\nmore traditionally Hella, which no doubt pleased\nmany, but still breaking new ground.\nIn many ways, despite spending most of their\ntime as a duo, Hella are the perfect culmination\nof the rock band; never afraid to try new sounds,\nbut with a propensity for catchy hooks and a pop-like sensibility that makes them manageable at all\ntimes.\nRiaz Agahi\nPt. IV - Hella\nBig O. doing what he does best\nAudience of One is a catharsis sandwich with\nambient relaxation instead of bread; In The\nMouth A Hand is a set of fierce but hypnotic\nsoundscapes, only added to the organic sound\nof Fire!\u2019s jazz instruments; and Imikuzushi is\nan exploration of some darker elements, often intense but just as often slow ominous and\nbuilding.\nIt is a common belief that prolific musicians\nare often inconsistent and that when you release that much output, some is bound to fall\nflat. While I have far from listened to Ambarchi\u2019s entire discography to truly confirm or\ndeny this, it is worth pointing out that every\none of these albums is well worth listening to.\nPerhaps it\u2019s the amount of collaborations that\nlead to this, but every album seems to be endowed with a little bit of genius, impressive on\nthe first listen but imbued with more and more\ndepth, subtler and subtler elements with each\nsubsequent listen.\nPlastic People\nSaturday 26 May\nBe sure not to miss...\nFloating Points\nFloating Points, as well as being everyone\u2019s favourite programming term,\nis also a London based PhD student\nand purveyor of excellent, jazz-in-fused electronic music.\nThe last Saturday in the month sees\nhim at Plastic People, a tiny club\noff Old Street with the most insane\nsound system.

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX Friday 25 may 2012 11\nThe decline of British bee power\nP\nesticides may be the bees\nknees when it comes to protecting crops, but researchers from the UK and France\nhave shown that exposure\nto one common pesticide leads to a dramatic loss to the number of queen bees,\nand another pesticide affects foragers\u2019\nability to find their way back to the\nhive. The new findings might go some\nway to explaining recent decline in bee\nnumbers.\nScientists at the University of Stirling and the Lancaster Environment\nCentre, both in the UK, exposed colonies of bumble bees to realistic levels\nof imidacloprid, a pesticide chemically related to nicotine, in the lab. They\nthen placed the colonies into the field\nto forage on gardens, wildflowers and\na variety of crops, and watched as the\ncolonies that had been exposed to the\npesticide suffered an 85% reduction in\nthe number of new queens compared\nto colonies that were not exposed. The\nexposed bees also gathered less food\nand produced less workers, but it was\nthe drop in queens that was most dra-matic. The findings were published in\nthe journal Science.\nA meta-analysis published last year\nshowed that imidacloprid was not lethal\nto bees, but since then there has been\ngrowing evidence from laboratory trials\nthat the pesticide does harm memory and\nnavigation. This new research is the first\ntime such an effect has been found in realistic conditions.\nA separate team of scientists from\nFrance found that bees exposed to low\ndoses of a different pesticide, called thi-amethoxam and belonging to the same\nfamily as imidacloprid, had trouble\nfinding their way home. The team glued\ntiny radio-frequency tags to the backs\nof 653 honey bees. Up to 43.2% of the\nbees given the pesticide did not return\nto their hive, depending on how far\naway from the hive they were released,\ncompared with 16.9% of the untreated\nbees. The researchers say that this level\nof homing failure could put a colony at\nrisk of collapse.\nThe news comes five years after bee\ncolonies in the US were devastated when\nthey were hit by a strange condition\ncalled colony collapse disorder. Millions\nof bees vanished from their hives, leaving young bees to fend for themselves.\nThe latest US Department of Agriculture data, released in 2011, suggests that\ncolony collapse disorder is still alive and\nwell \u2013 unlike the bees affected by it.\nBees, along with other insects, pollinate around one third of the crops we\neat. But in the past 25 years honey bee\nnumbers in the US and UK have suffered\na drop of around 50%. The reason for the\ndecline has been unclear, but pesticides,\nparasites and the destruction of flower-rich habitats are thought to be the key\nreasons.\nSeveral European countries have\nstopped using certain pesticides for fear\nof falling bee populations, but the UK is\nnot among them. A spokesperson from\nthe Department of Environment, Food\nand Rural Affairs told the Guardian that\nthe new research did not change the gov-Science and the law have clashed\nagain this week, and it seems that the\nUS is adamant in attempting to inhibit scientific advances yet again in\nthe name of public safety. This time,\nit is the geneticists that are under\npressure, as Californian senators are\nattempting to pass a bill that could\nhinder on-going research into genetic\ndiseases.\nThe bill, known as The Genetic\nInformation Privacy Act, aims to introduce consent forms covering the\nexplicit intended use of the genetic\nsample, which the person who is donating the material must then agree\nwith. The bill also states that such\ngenetic material must be destroyed\nafter, and cannot be stored to be accessed at a later date. Supporters for\nthe bill are keen to point out that it\ndoesn\u2019t stop research, just adds a new\nbureaucratic component to protect\npersonal information.\nWith the National Human Genome\nResearch Institute predicting that the\ncost of sequencing a genome is dropping at a greater than exponential\nrate, it is only a matter of time before anyone can get their own DNA\nsequenced at a reasonable cost. It is\nwith this increase in ease of access\nthat concern arose into how such\nsensitive and personal information\nshould be treated, triggering the new\nlaw.\nHowever, the proposed paperwork\nwill cost researchers around half a\nmillion dollars annually, according\nto the University of California, not\nto mention the time delay it will undoubtedly add to any sort of investigation in the future. This will especially hinder key research into the\ngenetic causes of diseases as they require thousands of genomic samples\nat a time.\nThis echoes the reasoning behind\nthe significant delay seen earlier this\nmonth of the publication of a key virology article detailing the artificial\ncreation of an influenza strain. In that\ncase, paper publication went ahead in\nNature without consequence. Should\nthis new bill be passed and then ig-nored, penalties will range from\n$1,000 to $10,000 depending on the\ncircumstances.\nWith many other states already\nputting into motion their own interpretation of bills concerning genetic\nresearch, it seems that this new expenditure is going to be an unavoidable reality very soon. This highlights\nagain the definitive need for some\nother mandate to form a bridge between public safety and scientific ad-vances, so both can be satisfied without any detrimental effects to the two.\nGenetic\nprivacy\nPhilippa Skett\nWildflower meadows are a bee\u2019s favourite stomping ground, but 97% of them have been lost over the past 60 years, adding to the decline of bees\nMuhammad Mahdi Karim\nernments position, but they would not\nhesitate to act if presented with any new\nevidence.\nCampaigns to encourage the growth of\nwildflower meadows \u2013 a bee\u2019s favourite\nhabitat \u2013 will go some way to encouraging numbers to rise. But these stud-ies, and others, show that it is unlikely\nto be that simple. Identifying the cause\nof colony collapse is essential to protect\nfood security, as well as the wild flowers\nthat bees pollinate and the animals that\ndepend on them.\nDOI: 10.1126/science.1215039\nDOI: 10.1126/science.1215025\nKelly Oakes reports on a possible cause of falling bee numbers\nBee decline: in numbers\n50%\nthe drop in honey bee numbers over the last 25 years\n2006\ncollony collapse disorder first\nreported in the US\n\u00a31.8 billion\nthe amount it would cost per\nyear to hand pollinate UK\ncrops without bees\nAttaching an RFID tag to a bee\n\n"

There\u2019s also that sense of accomplishment that you\u2019ve \u2018beaten\u2019 the\nsupermarket by not paying full price,\neven though you\u2019re probably playing\nstraight into their hands.\nAs you turn around to move on to the\nnext isle with your booty in tow, you\nbump into someone you know, whose\nbeady eyes were probably eyeing up\nthat cheesecake you just took. Ignoring them is out of the question now:\nyou\u2019ve made eye contact within talking distance and both of you are sta-tionary. Plan B: you exchange pleas-antries, talk about the weather, ask\nredundant questions like \u201cdoing a bit\nof shopping, eh?\u201d and generally lubricate the conversation until you part,\nbefore it grinds to an awkward halt.\nThe problem is that supermarkets\nare designed specifically so that you\ntraverse its isles in a scarily predictable manner: fresh produce, then meat,\ndairy, the frozen section, and finally all\nthe sweet, carbohydrate-laden goodies\nat the end. So you\u2019re browsing the milk\nsection calculating how much you\u2019d\nsave by buying four pints instead of\ntwo and weighing that up against the\nodds of you finishing it before it goes\nThe tale of why I hate food shopping\nsour, all the time looking like an idiot\nbecause the saving you make is something like five pence.

Stephen Smith\u2019s \u201cSexism at Imperial College\u201d has been viewed over\n7,500 times on the Felix website. Sexism is clearly an issue that concerns the Imperial\ncommunity and 631 of you gave us your opinion by filling in the survey. Thank you.\nWomen have always been students at Imperial College, even though it has always\nbeen a strongly male dominated environment. A lot has changed over the past few de-cades: Helen Kemp Porter became the first woman lecturer at Imperial in 1959, women\nwere first allowed into the union bar in 1972 and the ratio is slowly improving, currently\nat 63.7:36.3. Imperial is actually doing better than the national average for female undergraduates in SET, which was 33.2% in 2007-2008 compared to 35.29% at Imperial.\nCredits: Marie-Laure Hicks, Silvia Araguas, Philip Kent, Matt Colvin and Jonathan Kim\nIs Imperial sexist?\nCollege life\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pervasive atmosphere of thinking misogynistic comments are acceptable and that women should accept \u2018banter\u2019.\u201d\nEver wondered which departments are considered by the respondents to house\nthe most sexist students and lecturers?\nAero comes out as a clear winner. More than one in four students answered\nthat their fellow students are sexist. Aero was also amongst the departments\nwith the highest proportion of students claiming their lecturers are sexist, only\n6.67% though. Another department with seemingly sexist lecturers is Chemistry, with 65.85% of respondents stating that lecturers are sometimes sexist.\nStudents in Mech Eng, Medicine and Civ Eng are also more likely to be sexist\naccording to their fellow classmates, 62.5 to 72.73% of them saying they are\nsometimes sexist.\nThe award for least sexist department goes jointly to Bioeng and the Business\nSchool. Materials was a close runner up, 42.86% and 82.14% of respondents\nsaying that fellow students and lecturers, respectively, weren\u2019t sexist. No-one in\nMaths, Chemistry, Civ Eng, Earth Sciences, EEE or Humanities claimed that their\nlecturers are sexist.\nSo what can be done?\nDoes sexism have a negative impact on your Imperial life?\n6.67% women and 4.44% men said yes\nIn the recent Times Higher Education Student Experience Survey, Imperial dropped\nnine places. We wondered whether sexism might be a factor affecting the lives\nof people here, especially as Imperial\u2019s low scores were in the \u2018good social life\u2019,\n\u2018good community atmosphere\u2019 and \u2018good personal relationships with teaching\nstaff\u2019. A small percentage of students expressed that sexism had negatively impacted their experience at this university, however almost 40% of female respondents felt that it occasionally tainted their student experience.\nWhat is sexist at Imperial?\nJokes and\ncomments\nHangman and Felix\nPositive discrimination: women\u2019s only careers events and the belief that women are\nmore likely to be offered a place at Imperial\nbecause of their gender\nMen feeling that women are inferior and less capable in SET\nSample validity\nA grand total of 631 students filled in the sexism survey, or 4.30% of the entire student body (3.62% of male students and 5.07% of female students). Out of this number,\n338 respondents or 53.57% of the sample were men, 270 or 42.79% were women and 23 people or 3.65% of the sample preferred not to say.\nThere was a slight gender bias, as 6.49% more of our respondents were women in comparison to the gender ratio at Imperial.\nEvery department was represented in the sample, though some, as ever, found more representation than others. The most under-represented departments were Humanities, Medicine and the Business School. Aeronautics, Chemistry, Civil Engineering and EEE were also under-represented, but to a lesser extent. Life Sciences, Physics, Computing and Materials were overrepresented, with up to double their proportion of students filling in the survey. Overall, the Faculty of Engineering had the best representation.\nRegarding ethnicity, there was a large bias for white students, with 27.65% more respondents filling in the survey than the comparative ratio studying at Imperial. Asians\nwere underrepresented by 6.53%. Students of Black, Hispanic or mixed ethnicity were strongly underrepresented.\nAnother noticeable and very strong bias was the representation of undergraduates, as 85.42% of the respondents were aged between 17 and 22, with a relatively even\nspread across different years.\nNonetheless, the sample was not biased enough overall to not report on the findings, on account of the substantial sample size.\nWe would like to thank everyone who participated in the survey and contributed towards its creation and analysis.\nSexist events: some examples include groping, calling\nwomen \u2018babe\u2019, sexual harassment and lab demonstrators giving the \u2018easier\u2019 task to female students because\nthey are \u2018less capable\u2019\nTutors, lab demonstrators\nand lecturers\nImperial Memes\nMetric Moments The Hunnies and Bunnies night at the\nReynolds, described as being full of \u201cdrunk\nslutty bitches\u201d\nHere are the examples you gave us of what you find sexist at Imperial:\nWSET\u2019s \u2018Girls Girls Girls\u2019 event\nVoting for women in ICU\nelections based on attractiveness\nThe \u2018Imperial attractiveness\nrating scale\u2019\nThe male orientated choice of\nfilms shown by ICU Cinema\nThe drinking clubs: The Links, the Chaps and the \u201922 Club. These\nall-male clubs founded in the 1920s were criticised for being\nanachronistic, having a selective admissions policy and being far\nfrom the \u201crespectable\u201d societies they used to be. These clubs\nhowever are completely independent from the Union.\nSport societies: they were heavily criticised for\ntheir behaviour and comments, especially during sports\u2019 night and ACC, and making it unnecessarily difficult for women to participate. The\nrugby club and medics men\u2019s hockey club, in\nparticular, were also mentioned regarding their\nmailing list. When asked about the emails, a\nrugby player joked: \u201cwho wants another boring\nemail? At least if it\u2019s demeaning to women\u2026\u201d.\nOther respondents referred to inappropriate\nand sexist comments made to the cheerleading\nsquad and general objectification of women or,\nas some sports players would say, \u201cbirds\u201d.\nDo you think that there is a gender advantage at Imperial?\nAre men advantaged? 14.81% of women said yes\nAre women advantaged? 24.85% of men said yes\nRepresentation in Imperial College Union\n54.81% of women said that they were not appropriately represented\n52.07% of men said that they were appropriately represented\nCampaigns and Talks to Raise Awareness on\nSexism, Feminism and Gender Equality\nImprove the \u2018ratio\u2019\nLook to start a Gender Equality/Feminism Society\nImperial College could be more proactive in understanding why there are less women in SET and\nencourage them to study at Imperial\nA zero tolerance policy against\nsexism \u2013 this is already in place at\nImperial\nRe-establish the Equal Opportunities\nOfficer (both this role and Gender\nEquality Officer already exist.

It\u2019s society who has fostered\nthis \u201clads\u201d mentality. Let\u2019s blame British society. Bloody Tories.\u201d\n\u201cWomen at IC are given so many extra opportunities for careers\nevents, WSET and are generally treated with more respect than\nmen. \u201d\n\u201cThere have been times I felt hugely\nannoyed at being a female at Imperial\nhowever I think this was combined with\nbeing from a lower class/income household than many of my fellow peers, this\nis something I felt more angered with\nthan any sexism issue. But how do you\nstop the attitudes of petty little rich kids\nwho know no better? They are a minority\nanyway.\n99% of the people I met at Imperial\nare what they should be; intelligent and\nrespectful young people open to new\nopinions and most importantly open to\nchanging their opinions all mixed in with\na dry sense of humour. Have we confused this with sexism at Imperial? In my\nopinion, at time yes but I\u2019m fairly sure\nthe many \u2018lads\u2019 who attend Uni\u2019s such as\nLeeds/Manchester did so with the hope\nof many sleepless nights with various\nnorthern beauties. At least we know the\nguys at Imperial didn\u2019t apply here with\nthe mindset of f*****g everything with a\npulse; they don\u2019t have the chance!\u201d\nSadly, there\u2019s just a hell of a lot of sexist \u2018banter\u2019 from some\nblokes. For example, dismissing a female lecturer\u2019s opinions on\nthe basis of being unnattractive or \u2018menstrual\u2019.\nSexism at other universities\nUniversities continue to make the headlines under accusations of sexist behavior. One needs only look to this week\u2019s news and\nsee the University of Cambridge\u2019s online site The Tab come under fire for its \u2018Rear of the Year\u2019 competition. In March, a rugby team\nat the University of East Anglia was the subject of complaints over its behaviour, which culminated in its disbanding after exhibiting\nracist and sexist behaviour at a party. However, it is not always the student population who are featured in the column inches. In\n2009 a university vice-chancellor at Buckingham University was criticized after claiming that female students were a \u2018perk\u2019 to be\nenjoyed by male lecturers.\nWe asked what can be done to combat sexism at\nImperial, here are some responses: Since February a lot has happened on the\nGender Equality front. We\u2019ve had a Gender Equality Forum, kindly sponsored by\nthe Equality and Diversity Unit, attended\nby over 50 undergrads and postgrads,\nwhich generated several discrete areas\nof focus taking us forward into the new\nyear. Two of the most important ones\nhave already been put into action \u2013 the\nGender Equality Officer role has been re-defined, and senior members of College\nhave agreed with the principle of having\na women\u2019s tutor in every department.\nThese should provide ample opportunities for students and staff to address or\nseek help with non-gender-equal behav-iour. We also discussed a Gender Equality/Feminism society in some depth and\nit looks as though this could well be up\nand running by next year. Want to get\ninvolved?

If\nthe accompanying photograph doesn\u2019t appeal to\nyou then hopefully the remainder of this article\nwill inspire you to take a trip.\nThe destination in question is Alleppey, in the\nheart of \u201cGod\u2019s own country\u201d, Kerala. I know\nwhat you\u2019re thinking: isn\u2019t India usually affiliated with dusty temples, sprawling metropoleis\nand aggressive tuk-tuk drivers? Usually, and\nthat\u2019s why I\u2019d urge you to take a train (or plane,\nif you\u2019re feeling fly) to the more serene south\ncoast.\nKerala boasts the highest literacy rate in India, and the government places huge emphasis\non education and clean streets, which probably\ncontributes to its popularity as a global holiday\ndestination. While I\u2019ve covered some of the other attractions on offer, by far the greatest reason\nto take a trip to Kerala is to take a ride on a rice\nboat through its famed backwaters.\nThe best place to see the backwaters is by\nheading out from Alleppey, where there are\nprobably more boat operators around than there\nare kilometres of canals (more than 900, or so\nI\u2019m told). Inevitably, many of these operators\nwill provide you with sub-par bang-for-your-rupee, which is why Felix Travel has already\ntested the waters to find a more reputable ket-tuvallam provider.\nGambit Cruises (GambitCruises.com) offer\na variety of packages on their humble kettuval-lams that can be tailored by time and destination\naccording to your needs. Your houseboat package includes a captain, chef and handy-man, and\ncan sleep up to four should you stay overnight.\nFELIX\nFriday 25 MAY 2012\n28\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTravel Editors: Chris Richardson\nDushi Arumuganesan\nTRAVEL\nWishing you were here\nGet there: Northern Line\nSee: The lock, the markets\nEat: BYOB Brazilian at Guanabara\nCost: \u00a310 for a tasty burger\nSome say it\u2019s had its day, but Camden still has\nsome little gems on offer.

What\u2019s cool about\ncertain parts of the backwaters is the thousands\nof fireflies they house, which, if you\u2019re lucky,\nwill come out and greet you for some evening\nentertainment before you retire to your cabin.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that this ranked in my recent\nIndia top five: when you\u2019re kicking back with a\ncoconut on your kettuvallam, there\u2019s really very\nlittle to complain about. Whether you\u2019re interested in unrivalled scenery or just want to live\nout I\u2019m on a Boat, be sure to make a backwater\ncruise your top priority when visiting Kerala.\nChris Richardson The company has a flawless safety record, and\nall boats come equipped with more accessories\nthan Xzibit would ever consider including if the\nboats were to appear on Pimp My Ride.\nWhile you could catch a glimpse of the backwaters in the course of an afternoon, most people I know who opted to do so left dissatisfied\nand hungry for more, which is why I opted for a\none-night stay. It takes a few hours to get away\nfrom those trying to cram in a trip in a single af-ternoon, and by lunchtime you get to experience\nthe true serenity of the canals.

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX Friday 25 may 2012 5\nScientists protest to protect research\nOn Tuesday 15 May, around 80 physicists\nand chemists from around the UK held\nan unusual protest against their research\nfunder by parading a coffin and a horse-drawn hearse down London\u2019s Whitehall\nto Downing Street.\nThe protest marked the start of the Science for the Future campaign which is\nfighting for the reform of the Engineering\nand Physical Sciences Research Council\n(EPSRC). The protesting scientists argue\nthat a number of policies introduced by\nthe council place British research in mortal danger.\nThe unpopular policies include a decision to stop funding PhD studentships on\nresearch grants, limiting fellowships to\nspecific subjects and a ban on the resub-mission of most rejected grant proposals.\nA new funding scheme also means that\nmore money is being allocated by EPSRC\nstaff rather than through a peer-review\nprocess. The council\u2019s \u201cNational importance\u201d criterion, for which scientists must\nexplain how their research might meet\n\u201cnational strategic needs\u201d over 10-50\nyears, has also drawn much criticism.\nProfessor Tony Barrett, a synthetic-organic chemist at Imperial, is the chief\norganiser of the campaign, and has called\nfor the chief executive of the EPSRC, David Delpy, to take action or step down. He\ndescribed the moves by the council as a\n\u201cStalinist collectivization of science.\u201d\nProf. Barrett said, \u201cI don\u2019t want more\nmoney for science. I just don\u2019t want tax-Sophia David\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNews Editors: Sophia David\nAlex Nowbar\nPlans to record lectures are set to finally come to fruition next academic\nyear. College is set to work with video\ncapture platform Panopto in order to\nensure that lectures are made more accessible to students.\nThe collaboration will result in live\nlecture streaming, the opportunity to\nview previous recordings at any time,\nthe ability to view lectures on mobile\nphones and tablets, and follows suggestions by students listed in Imperial\nCollege Union\u2019s response to the 2011\nNational Student Survey Report.\nPanopto was founded in 2007, and\nwas built with technology developed\nat Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s\nSchool of Computer Science. The\nplatform now serves several markets\nand institutions with video capture\ntechnology.\nThis academic year the system was\npiloted in every faculty with over\n1,000 successful recordings made by\nstaff.\nJason Parmar, Deputy President\n(Education) who also sits on the e-Learning Strategy Committee involved with the plans said \u201cit has been\nfantastic to work with the committee\nand see resources be dedicated to this\ninnovation in teaching. It will improve\neducational access to students and improve the student experience here at\nImperial so I hope as many lecturers\nLecture podcasting to become\nreality after test successes\nMatthew Colvin\nPanopto provides services for Fortune 500 companies\nImperial professor Tony Barrett is the chief organiser of the campaign\npayers\u2019 money to be spent on a top-down\ndiktat programme emblematic of what\nwent on in East Germany.\u201d\nThe turnout of the protest was low with\nonly 80 out of 8000 researchers funded by\nthe EPSRC attending.\nProf. Barrett commented that, \u201cA number of my colleagues were afraid to be\nhere. They are concerned that their future\ngrant proposals will be in danger.\u201d\nThe protest has drawn criticism from\nsome commentators including Professor\nAthene Donald of the University of Cambridge who argued, \u201cThey are not representing all of us and many of us do not\nagree with their stunt.\u201d\nThe council also argued that the protesters were a small and unrepresentative minority of the scientific community.\nThey said, \u201cIf we are to continue to\nexcel in areas of strength, we must take\na strategic approach in how we invest \u2013\nso we have the right balance of funding\nbetween different research areas, making\nsure the UK has the right national capability in core disciplines and is addressing\nmajor societal and economic challenges.\u201d\nFollowing the success of previous edi-tions, this year welcomes LUSO 2012,\nthe Sixth Meeting of Portuguese Researchers and Students in the United\nKingdom.\nLUSO 2012 will take place on the\n16th of June at the Senate House in\nLondon. Its main theme is \u201cPoweringUp Portugal\u201d, aimed at encouraging\ndisclosure, communication and interaction in the fields of science, tech-nology, entrepreneurship, and arts,\namong others. LUSO 2012 will host\na diverse panel of prominent guest\nspeakers from the academic, entrepre-neurial, and political fields.\nSome of the confirmed speakers include Nuno Crato (Portuguese\nMinister for Education and Science),\nMiguel Seabra (President, Portuguese\nFoundation for Science and Technology), and Sir Tim Hunt (Nobel Prize\nLaureate in Physiology/Medicine\n2001).\nNotwithstanding being the annual\nmeeting of Portuguese Researchers\nand Students in the United Kingdom,\nLUSO 2012 welcomes participants\nacross all areas of study/work, ages\nand nationalities. Registration for\nLUSO 2012 will be open until 9 June.\nMore information can be found\non LUSO 2012 website http://\nwww.2012.luso.org.uk.\nImperial students organise\nmajor conference about\nPortugal in London\nJoana Moscoso\nThe LUSO 2012 organising committee\nas possible will take advantage of it.\u201d\nThe beginning of Autumn Term\n2012 will see an anticipated gradual\nintroduction of the scheme, though\nimplementing the video capture is entirely at the discretion of lecturers.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 25 MAY 2012\n12\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPolitics Editors: Joseph Letts\nRajat Jain\nPOLITICS\nStudent Debt Fears?\npolitics.felix@ic.ac.uk\nGot something to say? Send your articles to:\nNormally running is a cheap affair; running for the\nbus only costs several seconds of embarrassment\nand the occasional penalty of abject failure when\nthe driver leaves you behind in the cold. The cost\nof running for a sabbatical role in the IC Union?\nFor most merely the embarrassment of selling your\ndignity to secure a victory, begging for scraps of\nvotes from people you have suddenly decided to\npay attention to after blanking them on campus\nfor the last few years. Of course there is always a\nsmall amount of spending on advertising but you\nare restrained from breaking the bank, well as long\nas you can spell your name correctly.\nHowever, compare all of this to running for an important political office, say for instance President\nof the United States. Now that is what those in the\nindustry call \u201ccrazy money\u201d. Well, comparatively.\nIt\u2019s true that when campaigning for votes for a national election to become the holder of the highest\noffice in the land one must spend a certain amount\nof money spreading awareness of your quest and\npublicising your political views, otherwise people\nwouldn\u2019t know who to vote for and you would be the\nlast choice of everybody in the playground.\nOne key part of electioneering involves airing\na large number of negative campaign advertisements on local television networks, something\nthe pro-Romney Political Action Committee (PAC)\n\u201cRestore Our Future\u201d can certainly attest to, having spent $35 million on attacking fellow Republicans Gingrich and Santorum. However, campaign\nfinances aren\u2019t always the easiest things to man-age. It seems some presidential candidates make\nmore promises than they can fulfil, especially Newt\nGingrich.\nWhen Gingrich pulled out of the presidential\nrace on May 2, he did so having incurred a debt\nof $1.3m in the month of April alone. Although\nsome of this was paid back his total debt currently\nstands at $4.7m, including a bill of $12,000 owed\nto Twitter and $16,000 to a political company run\nby former presidential rival Herman Cain.\nHowever bad Gingrich might seem it could be\nworse.

    "content": "F\nrom the title, one will probably\nthink that this article is about uninteresting food habits or a nutritionist\u2019s advice and stuff that the majority of people don\u2019t care about.\nTo be honest that could have been my editor\u2019s\npicture of what I should write but indeed, the\ntheory of relativity suggests that everything is\nrelative, and because we are scientists it\u2019s good\nto apply it sometimes. Therefore, I am relating\neating habits and food preferences with actual\nhuman behavior and diversity of characters,\nwith a more specific zoom in on our life here\nat Imperial. In this college, there are several\nkinds of people, from different nationalities,\nstudying different courses having different\ninterests and hobbies. All of these factors affect the way we are fed and therefore one can\ndefine the kind of one\u2019s personality by using\nthis information. In the following article, I will\nanalyse some of the most distinctive kinds of\npeople here at Imperial, extrapolating from\ntheir eating habits.\nLet\u2019s begin with the \u2018\u2019money spoiler clich\u00e9\u2019\u2019.\nThis kind of individual spends more money\non food than on accommodation for a flat in\nCentral London, and I do not mean a lot of\nmoney on food because of quantity. You might\nbe wondering, how is that possible? Well, it is\nquite obvious that choosing to eat at expen-sive, highly valued restaurants for lunch and\nfor dinner on a daily basis, you would probably enjoy delicious meals but this also induces\nother conclusions. I would personally describe\nthis kind of individual as shallow and a snob.\nWhy is that? The fact that these people do not\naccept anything that might be cheaper, spend\ntheir parents\u2019 money extensively and judge others on the strict rules of savoir vivre says a lot.\nOn the other hand, a very attractive type\nis the \u201cintellectual\u201d. Students that belong to\nthis category are those who enjoy cooking\ntheir own food, sometimes using sophisticated recipes, and also throw on some music\nwhile they cook. If you are an intellectual\nyou will probably feel proud of belonging in\nthis category. Intellectuals are considered to\nbe very interesting people. There is no doubt\nthat if you enjoy cooking, you are passionate\nnot only about cooking but probably about\nother things as well. This kind of person sees\nfood as a source of inspiration and not just\na physical need for nutrition. Therefore, intellectuals can be very approachable and at\nthe same time mature. Maturity comes from\nthe fact that they have taken food seriously\nand converted its preparation from something that might seem a time wasting need,\nto an attempt for a perfect creation.

Oil a 9-inch pie plate.\nCrash the biscuits and add the sugar and melted\nmargarine and milk. Press the biscuit mixture in a\n9-inch pie plate and bake for 8 minutes. Let it cool\nand remove it from the pie plate. Make the cake layer\nby mixing together the milk and the vinegar. After 2\nminutes add the oil, vanilla extract and sugar. In a\nseparate bowl mix all the dry ingredients. Then, add\nthe liquid mixture in the bowl with the dry ingredients.\nMix until just combined. Do not overmix. Place the\nbatter in a 9-inch pie plate and bake for about 12 min-utes. Let it cool. To make the cream filling combine\nthe tofu, salt, vanilla extract in a blender. In a small\nsaucepan combine 1/2 of the milk and the agar pow-der, cook for 5 minutes stirring occasionally. Add the\nsugar, soy milk and cornstarch in a cup and whisk.\nAdd this to the simmering soy milk mixture and stir\nfor about 5 minutes. Add the cooked cream in the\nblender with the tofu and the other ingredients and\nblend until very smooth. Pour it immediately into the\nbaked pie shell. When the cream filling cools place\nthe cake layer on top of it. Finally, make the ganache\nby melting the chocolate, margarine and adding the\nmilk. Use a spatula to spread the ganache on top of\nthe cake. Refrigerate for at least three hours.\n\u201cYou are what you eat\u201d: A charac\nby Yiango Mavroconstanti\nthat intellectuals \u201ctreat\u201d their food is similar\nto the way they experience life in general.\nNext eating type: Asian! I personally love\ndelicacies such as sweet and sour or noodles,\nbut from personal experience, I had no idea\nwhat my kitchen-mate used to be cooking!\nWere those gigantic 30cm shrimps or huge\ninsects from the Jurassic age? Were they\nalive? Each nation has its own food traditions but I can say that Asians have been the\nmost brave in my eyes, including ingredients\nin their nutrition that I wouldn\u2019t even think\nof as edible. Many kinds of insects are included on their menu, but I have to acknowledge that they have high nutrition value.\nWhat\u2019s next? The \u201cCholesterolian\u2019\u2019. The\ndescription of this eating type is quite obvi-ous. Cholesterolians simply eat pizza, burg-ers, fried chicken and all kinds of fast food\nonly, at a regular day to day basis. One thing\nto note is that a Cholesterolian\u2019s excuse for\nthis is the fact that there is no time to cook.\nWHAT? SERIOUSLY? My dear Cholesterolians, feeding yourself is not something that\njust appears on your schedule to waste your\ntime, it\u2019s something you do for your own good!\nWe are now moving to a very common eating type at Imperial. This paragraph describes\nthe \u201cSandwich Nerd\u2019\u2019. In my mind\u2019s diction-ary, the Sandwich Nerd only eats sandwiches\nfrom the Central Library or JCR day and night\nas he or she literally studies all the time. Why\nall the time?

These\nlatest results however caused considerably more controversy than previous league\ntable announcements.\nThe Guardian\u2019s use of a \u2018Value Added\u2019\ncategory, and Imperial\u2019s low placing, compared to its traditional contemporaries in\nleague tables, has ignited the opinions\nof many across the Imperial community.\nThe category is scored after comparison\nbetween a university\u2019s entry requirements\nand the final degree result received upon\ngraduation.\nThe Union\u2019s Deputy President (Educa-tion) Jason Parmar has openly criticised\nthe methods used by not only the Guardian, but by league tables published by other league table-featuring publications. Certainly, it is mystifying that the value of an\nImperial degree is deemed, by the Guardian, to be significantly less than many of\nus would prefer to believe, especially with\nImperial\u2019s top ranking for career prospects\ncompared with other universities. However, the aim of the \u2018value-added\u2019 score \u2013 to\nassess the effectiveness of teaching at a\nuniversity \u2013 opens a whole new avenue of\nquestions.\nIs the result representative of the teaching at Imperial, or rather the comparative\nrarity of first class, and indeed 2:1 grade\ndegrees, delivered to students in comparison with other UK universities? Doubtless\nthere are those who would argue on both\naccounts.\nIt is not hard to understand why this latest news has been met with such a negative reception. Prospective students invariably make use of such tables and with a\nlarge number of students having to pay in\nthe region of \u00a330,000 (if not supported by\nfinancial aid) towards their degrees from\nnext year, making the right choice of university is critically important. The lesser\n\u2018value\u2019 that the league table assigns to\nan Imperial degree has been an affront to\nsome who applied here on the basis of a\nworld class education.\nGaining a first from Imperial is no easy\nfeat, but the difficulty of attaining a high\ngrade appears to have brought with it the\nrisk of plain and simple statistics painting\nImperial in a less than favorable light.\nThis whole situation simply goes to show\nthat there is a long way for league tables\nto come before full weight is placed behind\nthem. The reasoning behind the \u2018Value Added\u2019 score may have raised many tensions,\nand it does deserve to be questioned.\nLeague table responses\nexpected\nThe question of whether or not Congress should dictate morality is key\nAs always in\npolitics, a variety\nof airbrushed\nhalf-truths\nare being\nperpetrated\nto market this\nproposal.\n\u201c\nAs alw\nAs alw\npolitics\npolitics\n\u201d\nthis\nhis\nO\nn the U.S. political\nscene, a Republican\nsponsored bill is causing\nquite a stir. The \u201cWomen\u2019s Right to Know Act\u201d\nrequires females seeking to have an\nabortion to first undergo an invasive\ntransvaginal ultrasound. This is a procedure that involves what is known as\na \u201c10-inch plastic wand\u201d to be inserted\ninto the vagina. The purpose is to dissuade women from having an abortion\nby forcing them to acknowledge the\nfetus that they intend to abort. In some\nstates, congressional members have\nsuggested that women should also be\nmade to listen to the heartbeat of the fetus before they are able to proceed with\nan abortion.\nThis medieval type prescription is the\nlatest tactic being invoked in order to\nmoralize the country. It is a demented\nway around Row v. Wade (an important Supreme Court case in the USA\nregarding abortion), and is meant as a\nfirm punishment for women irresponsible enough to have gotten themselves\nknocked up or raped. (Generously, Republicans in some states have amended\nthe bill, making the procedure optional\nfor rape victims.)\n\u201cWomen\u2019s Right to Know\u201d rests on\ntwo baseless presumptions. First, that\nthe right wing has the one and only\nmoral code. Abortion is one of the most\npolarizing issues being bandied about in\nphilosophy or politics. It\u2019s a moral grey\nzone for which there is no consensus.\nFor a faction to claim they have the answer displays an especially base type of\narrogance. Second, Republicans seem\nto believe that women are blas\u00e9 about\nhaving abortions. Devoutly religious or\nincorrigibly hedonistic, it is unlikely\nanyone is having a red-letter day when\nan abortion clinic is involved.\nAlthough innocuous sounding,\n\u201cWomen\u2019s Right to Know\u201d is a flagrant\nassault on those views that contravene\nright wing religious doctrine. And far\ntoo many Republicans find women\njustifiable fodder for achieving their\nquestionable objectives. What is being\ncalled the \u201cwar on women\u201d is the result of the increasing encroachment of\nreligion into politics and the arrogant\ntendency of the right wing to forcefully\nprescribe their values onto the secular\nsavages who are deprived of virtue.\nThere is a saying in catholic education (of which I am a product) that \u201creligion does not impose, it proposes.\u201d\nExcept with regard to women, into\nwhich religion transvaginally imposes\na 10-inch plastic wand. You don\u2019t need\nto recite the annals of moral philosophy\nto know this bill is wrong. It is a cruel\nattempt to torture women who are already going through a challenging time\nin their lives. It\u2019s misogynistic and it\u2019s\nspiteful.\nAs always in politics, a variety of airbrushed half-truths are being perpetrated to market this proposal. Virginia\u2019s\nGovernor, Bob McDonnell, massages\nthe truth by stating: \u201ca woman should\nhave all of the information possible\nbefore she makes a decision about terminating a pregnancy.\u201d Kristi Hamrick,\nan alleged spokeswoman for American\nvalues, eloquently asserted that \u201cit is vital to protect women\u2019s health and ultrasounds are absolutely vital to women\u2019s\nhealth.\u201d This is of course two-faced ba-loney. It is devious word play meant to\nlegitimize malicious intentions.\nSenator Lin Coleman is right to refer\nto \u201cWomen\u2019s Right To Know\u201d as state\nsanctioned rape. Although its supporters disguise it as governmental over-sight, this proposal is nothing other\nthan an attempt to punish women for\nmaking \u201cbad\u201d moral decisions. It is\nrape by proxy. Plain and simple.\nAt best the republicans think of this\nbill as tough love, wherein the ends justify the means. More likely, however,\nthis state-sanctioned rape bill is an instrument intended to punish the dissolute for their transgressions.\nSome might argue that decisions regarding moral grey zones, like abor-tion, should be left to the individual or\nto the family, and that the state\u2019s purview ought to be limited by consensus\ndriven issues. But why shouldn\u2019t it fall\non Congress to dictate morality? Surely\ntheir 12% approval rating is a strong\nmandate to supply moral direction and\nshepherd our personal decision-mak-ing. Surely representatives in the state\nlegislatures in question, 83% of whom\nare males, know what is best for American women.\nThis medieval\ntype prescription\nis the latest\ntactic being\ninvoked in order\nto moralize the\ncountry.\n\u201c\nThis m\nThis m\ntype p\ntype p\nthe\nthe\n\n"

And then they came out\nof the water, waving at their names and\nlaughing with relief, with the best feeling of all: the feeling of achievement.\nThey did it; they showed that despite\nthe lack of training opportunities, despite having only five girls competing,\ndespite having two girls who only started synchro six months before, they can\nstill swim, and compete a nice routine.\nIt might not be as good as a routine with\nten girls; it might not be as technically\ndifficult as a routine from girls who did\nten years of synchro and practice every day; but here it is, pretty, clear, and\nworth a medal. After all these emotions\nthey were thanked by the organizing\ncommittee with a special scarf for coming all the way from England, and got\ntheir medal.

    "content": "I\nf you like your Felix lighthearted, you may\nwant to turn the page, because this article is\nanything but. The seeds of my piece were\nplanted when I heard that one of my friends\nwas planning to attend CodeF, a Google\nnetworking event \u2018exclusively for female computer scientists\u2019 attending top universities here in\nthe UK. These kind of events are commonplace at\nImperial, women-only events meant to encourage\nfemale scientists and engineers to apply to the top\njobs in the country, jobs that are skewed heavily\ntowards men. Unfortunately, these firms are fighting a battle that is very near lost in a fashion that\nplaces gestures over results. The losers are not the\nwomen already at Imperial, but the many women\nwho will be turned away before they even get the\nchance to wine and dine with Britain\u2019s best.\nAn opportunity lost\nThe information revolution is the first major \u2018revolution\u2019 to have occurred after women\u2019s rights\nrose to prominence. It was as such an excellent\nopportunity to start off with an attempt at gender\nequality. Looking at where we are now, however,\nit is obvious that this mission (if it ever existed)\nhas failed. Imperial is split 65%-35% between men\nand women, while the ratio in Computing is almost certainly worse.\nTop City and tech firms vie to attract the handful of female computing graduates that do make it\nin, but an undercurrent of mild sexism in industry\nhas also been well documented. In a now infamous\npresentation at a Ruby conference in 2009, a presenter used soft-porn images to illustrate how your\nservers could \u2018perform like a pr0n star\u2019, while an\nexcellent article in Mother Jones magazine titled\n\u2018\u201cGangbang Interviews\u201d and \u201cBikini Shots\u201d: Silicon Valley\u2019s Brogrammer Problem\u2019, documents\ncountless examples of women in the industry being not just discriminated against but (perhaps\nmore insultingly) being completely ignored.\nIt is a depressing fact that this battle that could\nhave easily been won many years ago has now\nbeen almost completely lost. This is leaving us\nwith yet another highly paid, booming industry\nwhere men vastly outnumber women. Firms that\nscrabble around for female computing graduates\nare not making things worse, but are not really\nmaking things better: the ratio of women to men\nentering the tech industry is still at best 65% to\n35%.\nIt\u2019s because of this that it\u2019s hard to believe that\nToo few women and no change in sight\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTechnology Editors: Chris Bowers\nFeroz Salam\nthe fight for equality has to be won in the work-place, or even at university. Most of the women\nI have worked with and taught in my four years\nof Computing at Imperial have been highly ambitious and passionate about the subject. They will\nprobably go on to great things at workplaces that\nwill bend to their terms rather than vice versa, as is\noften the case with graduates from Imperial.\nThe mission to motivate them into graduate\ntechnology is arguably not as vital, as they are\nobviously already motivated enough. Hiring the\n35% already in the doors is easy, but fixing the\nreasons why there are only 35% is where the real\nproblem lies.\nForcing an attitude change\nThe first port of call needs to look at our children,\nand the influences they receive. Toys and games\nplay a huge role here. The blogger Kate Bachus (at\nwww.katebachus.com) takes the brilliant example\nof Lego sets. Those targeted at boys are a magnitude more complex than those targeted at girls of\nthe same age. Skills you learn on Lego sets are\npretty much the exact same ones you apply when\nproblem-solving in programming, and it\u2019s hard to\nimagine girls having an interest in the latter when\nthey are never challenged by the former.\nSetting toys aside, games are another area\nwhere women are almost unconsciously sidelined:\ngames targeted at girls tend to be of the \u2018Good\nHousekeeping\u2019 variety (simplistic family and food\nmanagement routines), while their male-oriented\ncounterparts involve journeying across nations/\nplanets/fantastical lands to slay terrorists/aliens/\ndragons, often at a budget that would be enough\nfor twenty versions of Cake Mania (I\u2019ve played\nthree versions, so I would know). Given that so\nmany people I know first discovered programming\nwhen they were young \u2018to make a game\u2019, I suspect\nthat a fair chunk of the 65/35 gap lies there.\nNow that we have girls interested in program-ming, how do we get them to put that down on\ntheir UCAS forms? This problem is more com-plex, but I suspect a lot of it boils down to representations of programmers in the media. I can\nFeroz Salam on how equality is a long way away in the world of \u2018brogrammers\u2019\nThe girl takes care of the sparkly two-bit house in nauseatingly named \u2018Heartlake City\u2019 while the man holds down a real job. Both sets are aimed for the same ages\nTECHNOLOGY\nFELIX Friday 25 may 2012 13\nthink of only two major productions where the\ntechie is a woman: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and the American drama Criminal Minds. The\nmajority (CSI, The Social Network, Swordfish, or\nvirtually any major production with the need for an\nIT professional) all portray the person behind the\ncomputer as an awkward male with a one-dimen-sional personality.\nEven before you begin to delve into the expectations placed on women, you have to ask, who\nwants to be that man? I certainly don\u2019t. That we\nhave any women applying to work behind a moitor\nshould amaze us.\nClawing back some equality\nThe truth is, a brilliant opportunity to turn the\ntables on ingrained sexism at our universities and\nworkplaces was lost some time ago, probably before our generation was born. Instead, we start\noff with the same representation of gender as we\nhave in the other, older fields of engineering (Mec-cano for boys, Barbies for girls, anyone?), and the\nsmelly, antisocial male programmer as our pro-tagonist. Is the fact that we end up with abysmal\nnumbers of women in the field any surprise?\nMy advice for the bevy of tech firms lining up\nwith their women-oriented programs would be\nthis: fight the fight where it will make a difference\nin the future. Campaign for girls to be treated as\nthey are: fully intelligent and creative members\nof society, with the potential to be excellent en-gineers. School outreach programs help, but even\nmore necessary is the promotion of media and toys\nthat focus on girls working with computers too.\nDestigmatise the notion of working as a program-mer, by showcasing the best men and women in\nyour company doing things that make a tangible\ndifference.\nFinally, there must be a campaign to root out the\nsexist culture in technology that is so brilliantly\n(albeit unintentionally) encapsulated by the movie\nSwordfish: a woman on her knees giving a blowjob while a man does the real work.

The band\u2019s\nrecent singles are highly reminiscent of the\nstadium bothering doom-pop of White Lies\nand the lead singer\u2019s powerful vocals remind\nme very much of Chris Martin in his prime,\n( I am not entirely sure when that is but I can\ndefinitely say it is not now). Therefore it was\nquite a surreal night when I went to their debut\nalbum\u2019s launch party show at a small venue in\nNorth London. It was an odd sight looking at\na crowd of East London hipsters, industry lig-gers and fashionistas stroking their moustaches and sipping their Red Stripe whilst the band\nbash out some massive choruses smothered in\nswooning guitars, clearly with much bigger\nvenues in mind.\nZulu Winter have been widely tipped by\nBBC 6 Music, NME and Zane Lowe and so\nthey came accompanied with lots of buzz to\nLondon to play their first major headline show\nin the capital. They started the show looking\nvery confident and assured, and it was clear\nfrom the first song that the band were primarily concerned with sounding huge. The song\nthat most people knew, \u2018We Should Be Swimming\u2019, was carted out as their second song and\nthis can be attributed to one of two reasons;\neither the band were extremely confident of\ntheir remaining songs or they understood that\nthe crowd was so full of muted industry types\nthat an energetic and enthusiastic response\nwas never going to be forthcoming so what did\nthey have to lose by using the big guns first?\nI still remain undecided as to what was the\nreal reason. Other stand out songs were \u2018Silver Tongue\u2019 and \u2018Let\u2019s Move Back To Front\u2019\nwhich proved a real hit with the crowd; it was\nimpossible not to get caught up with the soaring choruses and sweeping guitar parts. From\nthe majority of the set it was very clear to see\nwhy, even before the release of their debut,\nZulu Winter are tipped to break into the main-stream.\nThe issue which I would raise to all those\njumping on the bandwagon is that there is\nnothing revolutionary or especially different\nabout Zulu Winter. Everything they produce\nhas been done ad-infinitum before and probably done better. Many words used to describe\nthe band go along the lines of massive, epic\nand ambitious but one description sticks better\nthan most: Coldplay-esque. The comparison\nwith Chris Martin and co. is not hugely wide\nof the mark with their album aimed towards\nstratospheric hugeness, aided by swooping\nmelodies and 80s styling. In the end I would\ndefinitely recommend checking Zulu Winter\nout. Be aware they are in no way groundbreaking but they do prove to be a very satisfying listen.\nFor someone who\u2019s as big a fan of Stones Throw\nRecords as I, it\u2019s a wonder I didn\u2019t get on this album earlier. In all honesty, it\u2019s probably due to it\nstill not being available on Spotify (Grooveshark\nto the eventual rescue). Anyway...\nQuakers is a 35 strong hip hop collective, massive even by hip hop\u2019s standards. At the core\nof the group are three producers, one of which\nbeing Portishead\u2019s Geoff Barrow, and they also\nhave their very own brass ensemble. Rappers\ninclude Stones Throw stars Guilty Simpson and\nMED, but the majority were recruited from the\nvast wilderness of MySpace (back before it lost\nall relevance).\nThe beats are as good as you\u2019re likely to hear\nand the variation in rappers keeps the flows\nfresh. The reason I haven\u2019t given this five stars\nis that it\u2019s perhaps not the most original production you\u2019ll hear on a hip hop album this year, but\nif you like hip hop, you love this.\nSimon Hunter\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nQuakers\nQuakers\n2012\nInspiration Information is the third album from\nR&B legend, Shuggie Otis. It marked a divergence\nfrom his first two efforts in that this album was\nself-produced. This and his use of early analogue\ndrum machines helped him create a slightly different sound from his earlier, more traditional rhythm\nand blues.\nThe appeal in this album has been lasting; many\nproducers still cite it as being hugely influential to\nthem and songs have been sampled by the likes\nof J Dilla and Madonna. Hell, \u2018Aht Uh Mi Head\u2019\nbecame hugely popular one summer after it was\nused in the soundtrack to TV show Skins.\nThe best part? Summer seems to have hit us\nand there isn\u2019t a better tracklist to an evening barbeque than this album.\nSimon Hunter\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nShuggie Otis\nInspiration Information\n1974\nMore hairstyles than you can shake a hipster at\nThe Hundred\nin the Hands\nChris Richardson\nFollowing what appeared to be an indefinite\nhiatus after the release of their eponymous\ndebut in 2010, The Hundred in the Hands\nare back on the scene. And while that said\ndebut managed to rapidly rack up favourable\nreviews from the likes of Pitchfork and Metacritic, it looks as though we can expect much\nmore from their forthcoming second album\nRed Night, which gets released next month.\nAs with all great electropop duos, Eleanore\nEverdell (vocals) and Jason Friedman (beats)\nhave a brilliant synergy that they manage to\nmaintain throughout their tracks. As far as\nproduction is concerned, think of those beloved twinkles that made Jamie xx a buzzz-word, but with a side order of amphetamines\nfed to the BPM that invokes constant foot-tapping. While sceptics were initially dubious about Everdell\u2019s vocal abilities, any such\nreservations will probably subside once they\nhear the new material: she manages to brilliantly capture the elegance of Lykke Li, but\nalso kick things up to Karen O when the crescendo calls for it. Combined, the duo have\nmanaged to create some brilliant tracks, the\nlyrics of which carry their appeal even fur-ther.\nWhile THITH have managed to maintain\na place in the hearts and iTunes libraries of\nthose who stumbled across their debut, I have\na hunch that their new material is going to be\nbig on the blogosphere and beyond. At a time\nwhen people are becoming increasingly disgruntled with electronic music that is so fixated on a \u2018drop\u2019 (at that beloved 55 second\nmark, no doubt), people are all ears for the\nmore ambient artists that offer you a massage,\nnot a massacre. If The xx, Grimes or Purity\nRing are your sort of thing, THITH are certainly one to add to your repertoire.\nWant to see The Hundred in the Hands\nlive? Catch them at White Heat, Madame\nJoJo\u2019s, on Tuesday 29 May, with support\nfrom Young Man. Tickets are \u00a37 from\nwhiteheatmayfair.com.\nGot an album you want\nto shout about?\nSend us a short review with a\nrating and we\u2019ll be your soapbox\nA band to look out for\n\n"

    "content": "I was in two minds on how to write this. On\nthe one hand as a stalwart Imperialist (person\nof Imperial College) with a thorough grounding in scientific lore, the word ether when referring to waves conjures up memories of an\nas-of-1887 defunct theory of a medium said to\ntransmit light through space. On the other, after having spent Easter in a less than scientific\nfamily in a less than scientific country, something inside me says possibly the importance\nof something doesn\u2019t always lie in whether it\nis true or not. It is this that leads to my somewhat Jekyll and Hyde opinion of the Ethometric Museum.\nThe Ethometric Museum itself is an installation in a room full of whirring, buzzing, beep-ing, flashing, soft siren-screeching machines.\nIt sounds part Willy Wonka and the Chocolate\nFactory and part primitive view of a brave new\nworld of robotics. But of course the sounds\nare a mere by-product of the ethometric waves\nfilling you with good will and positive energy.\nThat is the whole point. These archaic looking machines were \u2018rescued from a fire\u2019 and\ncarefully tuned to produce these never-before-heard-of-to-science waves: ethometric waves.\nThis is not a night out using Hangman\u2019s rec-ommendations. These were guaranteed to induce happiness by the time we left.\nIn a darkened room, about twenty duped individuals milled around looking at machines\nwith names like the Sonaesthetic Ethometer\nand Ether Flux Magnifier while things flashed,\nmachines beeped and a middle aged man in\na tweed suit with white gloves altered dials,\ngenerally looking serious and occasionally\nmaking magnets move metal objects. Enough\nto make anyone smile right? Well isn\u2019t that\njust it? This man lectures in contemporary\narts and music at Oxford Brookes University. I find it hard to believe anybody in the\nmodern age could fall for this sort of rubbish\nso instead I plug for the option that it\u2019s some\nsort of elaborate piece of art where the exhibit\nis more the acting, the people viewing it and\ntheir feelings. A happening perhaps, I\u2019m not\nsure, I\u2019m not au fait with this lingo. This view\ncould explain why it was shown at Battersea\nArts Centre and not Imperial College London.\nSo that\u2019s my take. Of the show itself, highlights included a blonde assistant, the fact that\nshe was eastern-European and her acting abil-ity. I was particularly impressed by how she\ndidn\u2019t laugh when she told some of her stories;\na favourite of mine was how Einstein calculated the age of the universe after an ethometric\nsesh.

These\nare the guys who compete against some other\n2500 shows for an audience at the Fringe every year and still manage to pack the house for\nevery performance.\nAt first glance, it\u2019s not easy to see why: the\nthreesome don\u2019t have the media fame of other\nFringe rivals such as Jimmy Carr, Eddie Izzard\nor Shappy Khorsandi; nor are they born out\nof a traditional representation like the Oxford\nRevue or the Footlights. It seems improbable\nthat the set, whose existence alone arose after\na rejection to perform in the Durham Revue,\ncould succeed in not only winning over but\nalso multiplying their audience every year for\nthe last five years.\nBut succeed they have. Their sketches are\nbrilliant, original and unforgettable: there may\nnot be anything particularly witty about them\nbut the boyish charm, charisma and excitement\nthat WitTank bring to the stage draws you in\nimmediately. See what you like at the Fringe,\nbut I can guarantee you that these are the guys\nWitTank spoons out\nhilarity at King\u2019s Place\nWin Nova Festival tickets!\nThe Arts Pages this week bring you a new competition \u2013 and this one is even bigger and better than\nthe last. The Nova Festival \u2013 music, art, theatre &\ncomedy all taking place in one big field in Sussex\n\u2013 is offering us a pair of tickets, valued at \u00a3100\neach, for the winners of our competition below.\nFor all you festival fanatics out there, this is the\nperfect chance to spend four drunken days swimming in love, happiness and just a little mud. Even\nif festivals aren\u2019t exactly your thing, it will give you\nsomething to do in the long, hot summer (5 \u2013 8 of\nJuly to be precise) if you were planning to spend it\ndoing not much of anything...\nSend us your best festival story \u2013 in 20 words\nmax. \u2013 to be in with a chance of winning one of\nour two tickets!\nThe two winners will be selected on Wednesday 6\nJune and will be revealed in Felix on Friday 8 June.\nBy that long scan of waves, myself call\u2019d back,\nresumed upon myself,\nIn every crest some undulating light or shade--some retrospect,\nJoys, travels, studies, silent panoramas--scenes\nephemeral,\nThe long past war, the battles, hospital sights, the\nwounded and the dead,\nMyself through every by-gone phase--my idle\nyouth--old age at hand,\nMy three-score years of life summ\u2019d up, and more,\nand past,\nBy any grand ideal tried, intentionless, the whole\na nothing,\nAnd haply yet some drop within God\u2019s scheme\u2019s\nensemble--some\nwave, or part of wave,\nLike one of yours, ye multitudinous ocean.\nOur Felix poets are on holiday this week (or possibly on exam time) so instead we bring you a bit\nof the sea from the great Walt Whitman. With this\nweather, who doesn\u2019t dream of the sea?\nBy That Long Scan of Waves\nby Walt Whitman\nyou will be quoting and imitating months after.\nWith this in mind, I was over the moon when\nI learnt that I would be reviewing one of their\nrare shows out of the Fringe milieu. Even in\nthe sleepy King\u2019s Place venue every seat was\ntaken, word-of-mouth being crucial to WitTank\u2019s fame. As the lights fade and the three\ntake to the stage their appearance electrifies the\nviewer as they seem to bounce off each other\nand the audience.\nMy only disappointment was that to a dedicated Edinburgh fan like myself, the material\npresented at this London viewing was largely\nrecycled from their previous shows. Even so,\nI was still able to thoroughly enjoy the perfor-mance. It hardly mattered that I wasn\u2019t hearing\nthese jokes for the first time, I was laughing\nmyself into a stitch anyway. If there\u2019s one thing\nthese guys are good at, it\u2019s timing\u2014something\nthe other shows of the night (The Three Englishmen and Nish Kumar) fell short on.\nGoing to the Fringe this year? Make sure you\ncheck these guys out. I know I\u2019ll be in the audience again.\nWitTank returns to the Edinburgh Fringe\nFestival this summer.

Scoring 84% under the category,\nthis placed the institution above the\nLondon School of Economics\u2019 relative\nscore of 82% at the top of the leader-board for this category.\nImperial is placed third amongst\nthe London-based universities, with\nthe London School of Economics being placed in 3rd position overall, and\nUniversity College London placed at\n6th position.\nDeputy President (Education) Jason\nParmar was particularly outspoken on\nImperial\u2019s position in the rankings, and\nleague tables in general:\n\u201cI believe that prioritising the student experience as a criteria for UK\nleague tables is commendable of the\nGuardian, The Sunday Times and\nothers. However, it is fair to say that\nthe methodology of these tables have\nmeant that they can be seen as doing a\ncomplete disservice to the prospective\nstudents who use them\u201d\n\u201cWe should be asking ourselves the\nquestion: should career prospects and\nresearch have greater weighting in\nmodern league tables if we are to provide future students with a good ser-vice? In the current financial climate\ncareer prospects are crucial to a student\u2019s choice of university, now more\nso than ever. The fact that the Guardian league table doesn\u2019t even consider\nresearch worries me.\n\u201cIn addition, their analysis and\nmeasure of the student experience,\nwhich contributes so heavily in the\ntable, is unreliable as it is based solely\non the National Student Survey. We\neven saw in Felix that the NSS could\nLeague table results questioned\nbe hacked by students with very little\neffort. In addition to this the three\nstudent experience areas taken from\nthe NSS are \u2018Overall Satisfaction\u2019,\n\u2018Feedback\u2019 and \u2018Teaching\u2019. But this\ndoesn\u2019t cover, for example, \u2018Learning\nResources\u2019, which is a very important\npart of the student experience.\u201d\nParmar was particularly vocal regarding the \u2018Value Added\u2019 category:\n\u201cAlthough in principal the \u2018Value\nAdded\u2019 category aims to \u201cshow how\neffective teaching is\u201d, it could easily\ndo the exact opposite. To top the table\nin this criteria, which is worth 15%\nof the overall score, a university can\nsimply increase the amount of firsts\nand upper seconds it awards, lower its\nentry requirements, and have terrible\nteaching effectiveness. This is counter\nproductive as it lessens the academic integrity of graduates, and hence the\ntable can easily misguide prospective\nstudents.\u201d\nDeputy President (Education) criticises choice of league table categories\neas of food security, which will be a\npressing issue with the growing global population\u201d.\nOther staff who are leaving include\nDr Tilly Collins, Senior Teaching Fellow in the Department of Life Sciences, which will have a further impact\non undergraduate Biology degrees\nsince Dr Leather also undertook a significant amount of teaching for them.\nDeputy President (Education) Jason\nParmar told Felix that \u201cthe reasons for\nthe staff leaving are their own which\nwe are unaware of, but it may be fair\nto assume that the low demand may\nhave played a significant role in their\ndecision.\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he continued, \u201cdue\nto the courses\u2019 reliance on the two\nstaff members they have had to be\npostponed.

After stopping at\na huge Tesco, dodging a cat in the road\nand listening to classical music being\ninterrupted by a whale repeatedly falling into a huge swimming pool, we arrived at the hut in Drws-y-Coed around\n1.30am and went straight to bed.\nWaking bright and early on Saturday\nwe had our first luxury meal \u2013 bagels\nwith smoked salmon and cream cheese.\nWe then set off on the minibus toArenig\nFawr. We were lucky that it didn\u2019t rain\nall weekend, but on Saturday there was\na thick fog that unfortunately made it\npretty hard to see any of the views from\nup high. After the ascent, we stopped\nat the top (854m) for our luxury lunch,\nhuddled in the shade of a memorial.\nOnce stuffed with posh bread, cheese,\nsalami, wild boar, other assorted meats\nand organic chutneys, we began the descent via Moel Llyfnant (751m). Soon\nenough, it was time for some Darjeeling tea (courtesy of Harrods) alongside\nscones topped with Duchy raspberry\nand strawberry jam (best food on the\ntrip) and clotted cream. We then headed\noff for the last stretch down from Moel\ny Slates (557m) towards the minibus\nthrough what is probably the longest\nstretch of bog that any of us have ever\nwalked through, and got thoroughly\nsoggy \u2013 with Rob\u2019s jump/skid/fall definitely being the most amusing.\nUpon returning to the hut, the wonderful cooks attempted to make a barbeque for our luxury dinner, but in the\nend had to resort to the oven. In the\nmean time, our soggy clothes, shoes\nand feet were dried by the fire. Our\nluxury dinner consisted of (many) burg-ers, chicken, sausages, salads, summer\ntrifles, wine, port, champagne and el-derflower cordial. Once suitably stuffed\nfull of luxury, some went to bed whist\nothers enjoyed polishing off the wine\nand after dinner mints.\nWe woke a little later on Sunday to\na beautiful morning and had our luxury\nbreakfast (croissants with more amazing jam and butter) on the scenic minibus ride whilst listening to classical\nmusic. Several people were feeling a\nlittle worse for wear after the previous\nday\u2019s walk, and so they went off to enjoy a ride on a steam train and walk in\nthe \u2018Welsh rainforest\u2019 in a nearby town.\nThe rest of us headed up towards Moelwyn Mawr (770m). The sun was peaking through the clouds and there was a\nslight breeze, making it perfect walking\nweather. The hike up was tiring but we\nwere rewarded with wonderful views\nall around, including being able to see\nout to sea. Our luxury lunch on top of\nthe trig point consisted of more posh\nbread, cheese, assorted meats and salad.\nAfter lunch we happily clambered\nalong a rocky ridge before dipping\ndown and then ascending back up again\nto Moelwyn Bach (710m). On the descent we stopped for some tasty homemade luxury Welsh cakes, courtesy of\nJim. Soon after, we hit some bog, but\nthankfully it was tiny compared to what\nwe walked through on Saturday. We\ngot back to the minibus around 4pm,\nmet up with the rest of the group, put\nsome lovely dry clothes on, and headed\nhome. After stopping at The Harvester\nfor a tasty dinner, texting in to an agony\naunt on the Radio 1 \u2018Sunday Surgery\u2019\nand singing along to Maroon 5, we\nmade it back to London for 11pm, in\ntime for everyone to catch last tubes\nhome and have a much needed luxury\nshower and sleep.\nSnowdonia in style\nAll you need is food... Sejal Mahida reports on the latest Fellwanderers trip\nI used to loathe dancing. I was one of\nthose people who stands in the corner\nlooking awkward, refusing to join the\ndance floor. However, in a moment of\ndaring, I tried Latin American Dancing\nand not that long after I found myself\ntravelling one Sunday morning to the\nsouth coast for my first competition.\nThe day got off to a bad start. I arrived at the Hove Dance Centre with\nrelative ease, rather smug at having\nsuccessfully negotiated National Rail\u2019s\nreplacement bus service. But as soon as\nI arrived I started to notice that something was not quite right. The building\nwas very small, its door was locked,\nthe lights were off, and the only sound\nI could hear was that of seagulls \u2013 there\nwas evidently no dance competition\nhere. After a few frantic phone calls I\nascertained that yes, I had got the right\ndate, but no I wasn\u2019t at the right place;\nI was meant to be at the town hall over\n2 miles away. When I finally arrived, I\nknew I\u2019d made it. Women in blindingly\nbright sequined dresses and thick layers\nof makeup were rehearsing their moves\nin the lobby. I panicked. Not only did\nthey look terrifyingly good at dancing,\nbut I also realised that I was both under and over dressed for the occasion;\nunderdressed because I hadn\u2019t stuck\nsequined jewellery on my forehead or\ngreased back my hair, and overdressed\nloved this type of dancing. Samba is a\n\u201cprogressive\u201d dance, which means that\nyou describe a circular shape around the\nroom as you dance. Rather inevitably\nas we (my teacher and I) \u201cprogressed\u201d\nin front one of the adjudicators, my\nroutine \u201cprogressed\u201d out of my brain\ncausing me to come to a rather embarrassing halt. Needless to say I did not\nget through to the next round. However,\nspirits remained high since the \u201cpairs\u201d\nevent was yet to take place. I had been\npaired at the last minute with a charming Parisian whom I was to Cha-cha-cha\nwith. Seeing that the individual events\nwere taking some time, I took the opportunity to take a stroll along the seaside\nand get something to eat. Hove looked\nbeautiful, bathed in the first sunshine of\nthe summer. Too beautiful perhaps, as\non my return it emerged that I had embarrassingly missed the pair event, my\nfinal chance to dance! I set off for home,\ndejected but convinced I should redeem\nmyself at another competition.\nWas the whole day worth it just for\ntwo minutes of dancing? Definitely. It\nwas great to see so many dancers of so\nmany ages enjoying themselves (there\nwas a whole section for 50 plus age\ngroup), and I picked up some tips about\nhow I should dress (!). I also saw dancing of the highest standard which was\ntruly incredible. I certainly no longer\nhave any inhibitions on the dance floor.\nThat is, when I make it there on time.\nStephanie Walton\nStrictly hate dancing?

I believe this fact can describe the\nLucky One as a slightly immature person or not yet an adult to be fair. On the\nother hand the positive thing about the\nLucky One is that is a very approachable\nperson. A Lucky One has many friends,\nor at least he or she has some very good\nfriends. Why? Who is cooking for the\nLucky One? FRIENDS! Now if I try\nto do some chemistry here, adding the\napproachability with the immaturity,\nwe have a person who is very sensitive!\nGot tired reading this? WAIT! We\u2019re\nnot there just yet! I can\u2019t say I saved\nthe best for the end but \u201cthe Mummy\u2019s\nKid\u2019\u2019 is an eating type that deserves to\nbe mentioned. \u201cThe Mummy\u2019s Kid\u2019\u2019\nis of course the student that when returning from vacation, fills the freezer\nwith tons of homemade food, cooked\nwith extensive care by his or her loving mom. The supplies include all the\nkinds of food that the Mummy\u2019s Kid\nwouldn\u2019t dare to cook and taste deliciously great. If Mummy\u2019s Kids leave\nin hall they probably occupy the whole\nfreezer themselves (yep, a lot of stuff!).\nI remember a floor mate asking me\nlast year while I was unpacking the\n\u201cgoods\u2019\u2019 (yes I\u2019m one of those): \u201cRenos!\nMother Karamanis must have spent\ndays of cooking!\u2019\u2019 Well she did, she\nstill does, but let\u2019s move on to discover\nsome of the characteristics of these eating type. Furthermore, the fact that\nMummy\u2019s Kids store food that can last\nfor a long time, means that they think\nabout the future, hence a Mummy\u2019s Kid\nThe \u201cSandwich Nerd\u201d: boring, dull, and a genius; we all need one of those!\nmight be always prepared on anything,\nthinking two steps forward each time\n(that\u2019s all hypothetical). It would be\nundeniable to also claim that Mummy\u2019s\nKids are most of times guys that have\nthe greatest love for their moms. This\ngreat love, combined with the fact that\nthey sometimes share their food supplies with others, suggests people who\nare approachable and sociable, which\nearns them lots of friends. The obvious thing to notice though, that always\nhappens, is that \u201cMummy\u2019s Kids\u2019\u2019 convert to any other eating type mentioned\nbefore, as soon as the supplies run out.\nSummarizing, we have gone through\nseven eating types in enough detail for\nyou to start spotting yourself into one\nof those. What eating type are you? You\ncan\u2019t find yourself into one of those?\nYou may be a combination of eating\ntypes. The complexity of everyday life\nhere at Imperial makes us synoptic,\nwhich may be described as a new eating\ntype. Is what you eat a character criterion though? Or is it just philosophical\nbullshit? It depends on how someone\nunderstands the article. You can reach\nto your own conclusion depending on\nthe way you think. For me, the eating\ntype is a character criterion. I wouldn\u2019t\nwrite the article if did not believe\nso. For others it could be just bullshit\nsomeone had the idea and pleasure to\nwrite about in Felix. My tip is that if\nyou have reached this paragraph reading the whole article, you clearly believe\nit is an actual character criterion. If you\nstill read the whole article but still believe it\u2019s bullshit, then there is clear\nevidence that you prefer wasting your\ntime reading bullshit in newspapers.\nThe \u201cMummy\u2019s Kid\u201d: Marry him, you marry his mother too!\nThe \u201cLucky Ones\u201d: Lazy and bored or just the smartest people at IC?\nlive in the Central Library (but they\nstill pay rent for a flat!). It\u2019s a pity,\nisn\u2019t it? Sandwich Nerds may like and\nactually be good at other things like\nmusic, sports or dancing and be talented but put them aside as \u201cthere is\nno time for those\u2019\u2019. Therefore, they are\nmost of times unhappy and complain\nabout Imperial life. I would describe\nthis attitude as ironic. Why complain\nabout Imperial life while it is your own\nresponsibility to find the correct balance of curricular and extracurricular\nactivities that makes you happy? After all, getting a 2:1 will definitely not\nruin your future career. What\u2019s more\ntragic, is the fact that Sandwich Nerds\nhave no idea that they are drowning in\nthe sea of pointless academic success.\nContrary to the last two eating types,\nthe next eating type appears to be the\none I would like to be. I call this type\nthe \u201cLucky One\u2019\u2019. Being a Lucky One\nimplies that you have your friends\ncooking for you all the time! How great\nis that? It is like an Imperial \u201cmum version\u2019\u2019, with the friends being your flat\nmates, friends that live in your hall, a\nboyfriend, a girlfriend or just a friend\nwith benefits. The Lucky One most\nprobably has no idea of cooking, which\nis a reasonable conclusion as he or she\nnever cooks. There is one major advantage and one major drawback about the\nLucky One. The negative side is that if a\nperson doesn\u2019t know how to cook, then\nthat person can\u2019t survive alone (unless\neating ready meals from supermar-trations by Ioanna Kalogeraki\n\u201cGetting a 2:1 will\ndefinitely not ruin\nyour future career\u201d\n\u201cThe Lucky One\nmost probably has\nno idea of cooking\u201d\n\u201cWhat eating\ntype are you?\u201d\n\n"
