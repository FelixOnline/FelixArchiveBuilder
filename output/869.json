    "content": "Edna Welthorpe checks out this\nweek's sexy stunner Union\nTransport Officer, Mylan Lester...\nItalian fashion\nfrom Milan\nFashion\nEdna returns, darlings, with the very hottest news\nfrom the fashion scene. This week we profile Mylan\nLester, Union mogul, who has narrowly escaped arrest\nby the style police on several occasions. I understand\nthat since Mylan bought his new summer wardrobe,\nthe boys in aquamarine have instigated a shoot-to-kill\npolicy.\nA hardened entrepreneur, Mylan needs a veritable\nmultitude of pockets in which to store all those useful\nappliances you need to carry out lucrative business\ndeals in and around College. Rohan bags are the ideal\ntrousers for this of course, especially when you're\nclimbing up and down the Union Building. What he\ncan't fit into his pockets Mylan crams into his tool box,\nworking on the principle that the bigger your tool-box\nthe bigger your tool.\nWhat I usually like to do in my column, darlings, is\nto list my model's clothes and where to snap them\nup next time you go down the high street, but this\nweek please remember that only someone with the\nsheer charisma of Mylan should attempt to wear his\ndaring summer collection. After all, when did you last\nsee Steve Davis wearing reflecting rainbow\nsunglasses, a khaki pseudo safari jacket, grey rohan\nbags rounded off with purple snake skin boots for\nthose happening nights in the Union Bar?\nBut, luv vies, please, do not-l repeat do not try to\nwear any of these dangerous avant-garde garments\nat home! They may cause serious injury to your street\ncredibility.\nAnother interesting object around Mylan's person\nis a large jangling bunch of keys. Now don't be misled\ndarlings into thinking that the more keys Mylan has\nthe more doors he can open for you. No! In ah\nexclusive study we can reveal that the key ring holds\none key to his toolbox, 20 identical copies of the\nDramsoc Storeroom key, and one for his emergency\nsupply of Jacob's Cream Crackers. Fortunately\ndarlings we didn't find the key to his chastity belt\nwhich we are pleased to inform you has been\nimpounded by the RSPCA.\nAnd finally the black growth above his mouth is not,\nin fact, an extension of his nostril hair as popularly\nrumoured. Nor even small scale horticulture of organic\ncress-no darlings it's an exquisitely manicured\nmoustache specially done by Uncle Alfi's Barbers, just\nopposite Milwall football ground. Salvador Dali eat\nyour heart out!\nWMKmm\nPage 10\n\u2022 A four hundred metre long plant has been\ndiscovered on the slopes of the Cleveland Hills, near\nOsmotherley, North Yorkshire. Using pioneering\ngenetic cooling techniques researchers from\nManchester University have untangled Britain's longest plant-a growth of bracken. The spread of\nbracken is now being taken seriously since it covers\nan area the size of Devon and is expanding at three\nper cent a year. With two thirds of the plant\nunderground it is difficult to control. Cutting the\nsurface growth has no effect, the roots of this\npoisonous plant just put up new shoots.\nThe research, led by Dr Elizabeth Sheffield, have\ntravelled all over Britain taking genetic fingerprints to\ntrace the bracken's family history.\n\u2022 Watch out for pecked milk bottle tops.\nEnvironmental Health Officers have identified cream\nloving jackdaws as the cause of over 58 cases of\ndiarrhoea in three months in one housing development\nin Gateshead. The bacteria Campylobacter Jejuni\nwhich lives on the beaks of the wild birds is believed\nto be responsible for the outbreak.\n\u2022 Separate science GCSEs could be abolished\nand replaced by a 'balanced science' award. The\ninfluential Association for Science Education which\nrepresents Britain's science institutions and major\ncompanies, has given its backing to the idea which\nwill almost certainly get government approval. Dick\nMorris, Associate President of the School Examination\nand Assessment Council, fears that Britain could be\nleft behind if more pupils do not take science. These\nnew proposals could double the number and has been\nfound to be particularly attractive to girls. The\nexaminations council has advised that the double\nscience GCSE should become part of the national\ncurriculum. Only state schools will be obliged to teach\nbalance science and pupils from the independent\nsector may have an advantage in university\napplications if they have studied the separate\nsubjects.\n\u2022 Have a nose job for \u00a3 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 - the government\nis. The University of Warwick have been given a grant\nto develop sensors capable of 'smelling' the aroma of\nbeer. Also researching in this field are University of\nManchester Institute of Science and Technology, who\nwill be unveiling their nose in the next week.\nUMIST's effort out sniffed a trained dog in finding\nburied truffles in French truffle fields. It uses organic\nsemiconductors which react to smells in seconds and\nis said to be excellent at identifying wines, but the\nWarwick group, sponsored by Bass, has the edge with\nbeers.\n\u2022 The cost of stopping global warming, could cost\nsome three trillion dollars a year, more than the US\ngross national product. This is the reason that the US\nhas given for being the only country out of 34 not to\nsign an agreement on aid to developing countries. At\nthe conference in Norway delegates from America\nsaid that it was the only nation which realised what\nthe real cost would be. British environment minister,\nDavid Trippier, fears that this action could jeo pardi se next month's conference in London on CFCs. The bill\nfor cutting CFCs could be over two hund ren million\ndollars. Of this the US seems likely to pay twenty per\ncent.\n\n"

It's true Linstead is very\naccessible from Exhibition Road, and the geographical\ncentre of the ward, but the demographic al centre is\nfurther east.\nThat aside, the ICP did very well, but we knew by\nhalf nine that Conservatives had won: our guess was\nCon: 800, ICP: 500, based on rather pessimistic\ntelling returns. I wasn't at the count the following day,\nbut I'm sure Ms Warren's description of 'schoolboy\nrivalry or football hooliganism' is unfair. The\nConservatives held a council there had been a good\nchance of losing, and the relief and jubilation was -understandably - enormous.\nI still think ICP do not appreciate the concerns of\nKnightsbridge residents who don't want more halls of\nresidence, because of the effect they would have on\nproperty values. You may think this is a rather selfish\nview, nevertheless it is a prevalent one. Many votes\ncast late in the day were anti-ICP rather than pro-Tory.\nWe increased our majority on the council to thirty.\nThe Labour leader and his two deputies lost their\nseats. Nationwide the results were dreadful, but in\nWestminster we did stuff the opposition.\nYours sincerely,\nUltan McCarthy, Treasurer, ICU ConSoc.\nA biologist's viewpoint\nDear Dave,\nThis is in reply to Rob Crompton's Prolife article last\nweek. We are two second year Biologists and we are\ncertainly not experts but we hope to put across a more\nbalanced discussion of the issues involved.\nWe understand that embryo research and abortion\nare very emotional issues but it is also important to\nlook at them rationally.\nWe agree with Rob that reducing permission, for\nabortion up to 12 weeks, to one doctor and allowing\nabortion on demand using the RU486 'Abortion Pill'\nis not acceptable as it could well lead to the use of\nthese options as late forms of birth control.\nHowever abortion is very much a mother's choice,\nif her husband respects her wishes he will agree to\nwhatever the choice. Doctors are there to provide a rational view on the situation helping parents by\ncounselling, but then leaving the parents, and the\nparents alone, to make the decision.\nThe parents may want to consider abortion in cases\nwhere the health of the mother and/or baby is at risk,\nrape, and in cases of severe abnormality.\nIt is a very extreme and misleading view, to think\na mother would abort a baby with a harelip or club\nfoot or any trivial deformity upon a normal delivery,\nand quite frankly ridiculous.\nExperimentation is performed on both fertilised and\nunfertilised eggs but there are enormous differences\nin the two and it is sometimes necessary to use the\nformer. It is important to note only a small number of\nthe cells in the embryo up to 14 days from the adult\nin later life, most of the cells go to form the placenta\nand ch orion system, which are later discarded, single\ncells can be extracted from this group without\naffecting the embryo proper.\nWith all due respect to Rob and Prolife as we are\nwell informed and rational we do not agree with the\nextreme views he expressed. The aim of this science\nis to care for unborn babies, as prospective parents\nof course we care too.\nNo one in today's society has the right to impress\nupon peoples' minds what they should think. Abortion\nand embryo research remain personal subjects which\nbreed fierce passions in many of us.\nScientists today are offering choices to parents not\nultimatums.\nYours,\nIan Jones and Amy Sumner, Biology 2.\nSmall Ads ADVERTISE IN THE FELIX SMALL ADS SECTION\nFREE IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF IMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE UNION\nANNOUNCMENTS\n\u2022 Where will the animal dump?

    "content": "Insanity\nI am starting to doubt my own sanity. I cannot\nunderstand why I continue to produce FELIX when I receive crack-pot letters from 'wim min' like\nSamanatha Free and Kay Leedham-Green (see Letters\n'IC's female eunuchs.' From an issue which covered\nprostitution and politics, they managed to take\noffence to a book review. I have a strong suspicion\nthat the authors spent their knitting break in an intense\ndebate on the review and the questions of sexual\nstereotyping it raised (man).\nThe letter reminded me of the NALGO (National\nAssociation of Local Government Officers) reaction\nto Ben Turner's 'Great Tits' posters. The NALGO\n'Chair' (apparently there is still gainful employment\navailable to items of furniture) complained about the\nsexist nature of this and other student union material.\nI hear that she is the kind of perkin who objects to\nthe word 'manhole' on the basis that it implies a male\ndomination of our society. Sadly Ms Footstool used\nthe word 'manage,' during her missive, which should\nhave read 'perkin age'.( Person is sexist since it implies\na male kin.) The sort of extremism which this kind of\nperkin generates is truly crackpot. All I can add is,\nhuge bottoms and boobs to you too, Ms Footstool!\nSt Mary's On a more serious note, I should like to congratulate\nSimon Smith for winning his election for President of\nSt Mary's Student Union. This year's President,\nRhydian Hapgood, has done an excellent job,\nsmoothing the rough waters stirred up last year by\nNigel Baker and his 'diplomacy.'\nLast night I went 'across the park' to chat to a few\npeople from Mary's. It was interesting to see how\nstudents at Mary's view IC. One of the largest\nobstacles to any interaction between the South\nKensington and Paddington sites seems to be a general distrust. I can understand the fears of students\nat Mary's. Many of them believe that IC Union wants\nto swallow up their clubs and their finances. St Mary's has a strong community where everybody knows one\nanother and everybody is involved in some sort of\nextra-curricula activity. If IC Union were to incorporate\nthe clubs at Mary's into its own, a great deal of this\nspirit would be lost. Having seen the 60% + turnout\nfor their elections, compared to the pathetic 15-20%\nIC usually manages, I can see why they are so\nconcerned. Do students at St Mary's really want that\nsort of apathy to spread across the park? St Mary's student union needs financial independence.\nWhatever arrangement emerges from talks next year,\nthis will have to be a key point. Once this issue is\nsettled, I believe the resulting trust between the two\ncommunities will lead to better connections.\nCompetition\nI have decided to award a prize of \u00a35 to the first\nperson who can produce a photograph of that nice\nman from estates, lb Hagan.. when he is smiling.

Teenage Dream\ndoes however have a Gedge-live melancholia, possibly\narising from their tour with the Weddoes last year.\nLive, Thrilled Skinny are one of the most fiery acts\naround; they recreate the dynamism once forged by'\nSwell Maps, Wire and The Fall. Sadly, this is isn't fully\ncaptured on Teenage Dream, but does come pretty\nclose.\nCyril.\niJ The Keatons\nResidivistish 7\"\nThe Keatons, mutant descendents of Beefheart, Wire\nand the creators of Losf in Space, spawn their first\nenergetic piece of plastic; an ug lar guitars criss-cross\na psychotic flange d bass and grind until, somehow,\na pop masterpiece emerges: d is chord, mumbling, a catchy chorus-Residivistish has it all.

    "content": "Pretty Woman\nRichard Gere is back. After a significant period of\nabsence, forsaking the silver screen for higher things\nlike Buddhism and the Tibetan independence\nmovement, he returns in double helpings with Internal\nAffairs and now Pretty Woman. He's rather like the\nNo. 14 bus-you wait for years and then two or three\ncome shooting round the corner at once.\nIn his first major comedy role, Gere plays Edward\nLewis an ethic less corporate raider who, lost on\nHollywood Boulevard, inadvertently picks up Vivian\n(Julia Roberts) while asking directions to his deluxe\nBeverley Hills hotel. They then discover they have\nsomething in common-they both screw people for\nmoney. Edward decides to take Vivian on for a week\nfor the princely sum of $3000, primarily as a companion which isn't quite what Vivian's used to.\nEven so, they still end up in bed together on the first\nnight.\nThe story progresses as they both push thoughts\nof things financial into the back seat and they fall in\nlove, bringing the positive things out in each other in\nthe process. If you're thinking that this story has\novertones of Pygmallion/My Fair Lady or even\nCinderella then you wouldn't be the first, but despite\nthe twee storyline there's a lot to appreciate in this\nfilm, and not just Richard Gere...\nFor a start the tale has enough variations to set it\napart from its predecessors and enough humour to\nhave one grinning constantly over large chunks of it.\nOne particularly amusing episode happens when\nVivian, equipped with Edward's credit card but still\nin her 'street' clothes. At first she is shunned by\nhaughty shop-girls who turn their noses up at her and\nturn her out of their bourgeois boutiques. But when\nEdward returns with her to another shop, he informs\nthe manager that he has an obscene amount of money\nand that some major sucking up is required:\n'Exactly how obscene an amount of money were\nyou thinking of spending', asks the manager, 'profane\nor really offensive?'\n'Really offensive' says Edward.\n'I like him so much' retorts the manager.\nThe script also makes the point that prostitutes are\nvery much treated as second class citizens (see last\nweeks FELIX!) and on the whole deals with the subject\nvery maturely, avoiding trivia lising. Richard Gere carries off his first comic role nicely\nstill retaining the charisma and that oh-so-slow blink\nhe showed in earlier films while the leggy Julia Roberts\n[Mystic Pizza and Steel Magnolias) is a pleasure to\nwatch. It was a shame though that we didn't see more\nof Laura San Giacomo (Steamy Sexual Dreamboat in\nSex, Lies and Videotape), playing Vivian's Work/Flatmate who 'shares her life, but can't quite share her\ndreams'. So, Pretty Woman-Pretty Funny-Pretty\nMan-Pretty Engaging-Quite Good.\nAdrian Pagan.\nBreaking Bmk\nLeviathan\nthe Shackles\nFilm\nEd by Michael Newman\nAh, Imperial. Great institution! H.G. Wells came here\nyou know. Well, that much is true. The thing people\ndon't tell you is that Mr.Wells didn't like it very much\nhere. This book uses this information as a starting\npoint for a discussion on the present education system\nand liberal education principles.\nThe gist of the argument can be roughly\nsummarised thus. Education can come at you in two\nways. You can have the information packed into your\nbrain to be regurgitated all over the examination sheet,\nor it can be taught in a way that will develop a genuine\ninterest in the subject, and develop the repercussions\nof what is learned in the subject into the sphere of\neveryday life.\nH.G. Wells found examples of both at the then\nNormal School Of Science. The liberal education came\nfrom Prof. Huxley, whose teaching Wells found\nfascinating. Then he moved on to a Physics course\nwhich killed his interest stone dead. Little has changed\ntoday.\nUsing excerpts from Wells' memoirs and writings,\nother documents from IC archives and the editor's recollections of his own time at college, including\nsome very interesting tales about the RSM's Hon Porn\nOfficer, and the Porn Night (That's been abolished\nnow-they print it in Pit instead) the arguments are\ngiven. It makes for fascinating and thought provoking\nreading, so rush to the Union bookstore immediately\nand purchase your copy, they're just under two quid.\nAdam T. The press release for this film gives the Chambers'\ndictionary definition of the word 'Leviathan': a water\nanimal, apparently a crocodile (Bible); a huge sea\nmonster, anything of a huge size, especially a ship or\na man; Satan...and tries to keep its options open by\ncovering all of them.\nApparently filmed in left-over sets from The Abyss\nPeter 'Twenty Seconds to Comply' Weller and his all-star (nearly) trusty crew (including Richard Crenna,\nAmanda 'Max Headroom' Pays and Ernie Hudson (the\nfourth Ghostbuster no-one remembers) come into\nconflict with what we are told is 'an awesome secret'\nand find themselves in a 'desperate struggle for\nsurvival' with a 'deadly and malevolent lifeform'.\nThat's as much of the plot as you need to know.\nSuffice it to say that the story is ripped wholesale from\nthe godly Alien and stuck underwater.\nSomehow the entire plot comes across as not\ncomposed of clich es but a huge lumbering has-been\nwith only Ernie Hudson emerging radiant from the\nwreckage with his brilliant one line reply to Meg\nFoster's 'You must have been through hell'\u2014'Bitch\nwe're still here!'. He does, of course get killed at the\nend, leaving Beck (Weller) and Willie (Pays) to live\nhappily ever after.\nOn the plus-side the set is brilliant and the effects\nare quite adequate, coming from what appears to be\nan entirely Oscar lauded team, responsible for Alien(s), Terminator and varius part os the Star Wars trilogy.\nThe acting is as good as could be expected (all the\nactors are at least competent) but let down by the\nscript, which is disappointing given the writers'\ncredentials [Blade Runner and Die Hard).\nNice guest appearance by the Pathetic Sharks (or\nsome of their relatives) at the end; they pop in for a quick, utterly unnecessary and one hundred per cent\nun thrilling moment at the end.\nIf you can get in cheap this film is well worth seeing\nfor the chance to relive your favourite ten action films\n(pick any ten, any ten at all).\nThe Amazing Flying Gerbil Machine.\n5 Page\n\n"

As it now seems to be common\nknowledge amongst my colle ages in the first year, I am now more relaxed and able to show my true self\nto all.\nThe only slight intolerance I have come across is due\nto the classic misconception that gay men are after\nevery man they see. On a recent field trip to the Isle\nof Arran in Scotland, everyone seemed reluctant to\nshare a twin hotel room with me. As it turned out the\nparty was an odd number and I ended up with a room\n(and bathroom) all to myself for ten days!\nI can safely say, hand on heart, that I am glad to\nbe out to all my friends, and so far has made little or\nno difference in their attitudes towards me as a person\nand a fellow geologist. Imperial College is not as\nintolerant as we are all led to believe. Perhaps more\nwill come to realise this fact and come out to their\nfriends. It is in this way alone that we can prove the\nstereotypes of gay men to be the lies that they are.\nThe final hurdle to total peace of mind awaits: how\ndo I tell my parents?\nYours,\nStuart Joscelyne, Geology 1.\nTHE GREAT IC DEBATE WILL YOU\nBLOW-UP\nYOUR\nCOLLEGE?\nSpeakers include: Trevor Phillips,\neditor of Ixindon Weekend Television\nand Nina Temple, first woman\nsecretary of the British Communist\nParty\nIl:. \u00ablp mI| Tuesday 22nd May I Read Lecture Theatre, Sherficld Building\nBring a leaflet along & you could win a trip to the Laserium, a Martiiin, or Jeff Wayne's Double Album 'War of the Worlds'.\nDear Editor,\nIan Hodge's review of Warren Farrell (PhD)'s book\nWhy Men Are The Way They Are was so enjoyable\nwe literally dined out on it.\nThe topic was serious (the iniquities of sexual\nstereotyping), the arguments were however hilarious\nand the conclusions outrageous (that women want to\nbe sexual stereotypes but men don't). Though we\nhaven't read the book, if the article is anything to go\nby, it is a classic.\nFarrell's basic premise, as related by Ian Hodge,\nappears to be the same old story: women are to blame\nfor the way men are, thus absolving men from taking\nany action to change their behaviour or their view of\nthe world. When women first demanded the right to\nwork outside the home, they were accused of\nemasculating the head of the household (the male).\nNow women are supposed to subconsciously desire\nto be 'kept women', forcing the man to work or\nstarve. No wonder Ian is confused.\nFarrell's evidence about the behaviour of women\nseems to be based on reading 'women's' magazines\n(but no mention of Spare Rib or Everywoman), If he\nwants real evidence about how women behave why\ndoesn't he study the real live variety rather than the\nfantasy of the owners, publishers and advertisers.\nHodge's evidence that Farrell is right is only 'too\nmuch of what he says is true for it to be complete\nrubbish'...ho hum! In fact, the classic nuclear family\nGay support\nDear Sir,\nI was interested to read recently in FELIX the article,\nand subsequent letter, by Jason Fisher about his\nexperiences of being more open about his\nhomosexuality. I feel I must commend him for his\ncourage in writing about this personal subject with\nsuch honesty.\nThe problems associated with 'coming-out' can\nappear almost insurmountable to young lesbians and\ngay men. Not only must we learn to value our\nhomosexuality as something positive and enriching,\nwhich it certainly is, but we must also,\nsimultaneously, try to combat the prejudices and\nmisconceptions which, even in this moderately liberal\nera, still prevail to a limited extent in the minds of\nsome people.\nThe ULU Lesbian and Gay Society is a social group\nwhich is run by, and for, students in London, and\nDear Dave,\nI would like to reply to Rob Crompton's article in\nlast week's FELIX on the Human Embryo\nExperimentation Bill. To suggest that any member of\nthe medical profession would kill a foetus, let alone\na child in the process of being born for 'trivialities such\nas hare lip of club foot' is outrageous and I am sure\nhis comments would offend many doctors and\nmidwives. As I am sure Mr Crompton knows only too\nwell, the 24 week abortion time limit is intended to\nbe relaxed should the foetus concerned be grossly\nhandicapped and under very special circumstances\nonly.\nMr Crompton also appears to believe that if only one\ndoctor were able to give permission for an abortion\nup to 12 weeks pregnancy, instead of the two needed\nat present, this would reduce the 'significance of an\nis an absolute minority in Britain today (less than 10%\nof households). In most households the women have\nto work to keep the family, as a sole income is\ninsufficient, but they still continue to do virtually all\nthe housework [That's Women's Work: London\nResearch Centre, April 1989). The household\nstructure which is increasing most rapidly is the single\nparent family, the overwhelming majority being\nheaded by a woman. Within two years of divorce the\nvast majority of fathers have lost touch with their\nchildren, which includes, in most cases, the cessation\nof maintenance. Where is the shared financial burden\nthere?\nHowever we have to agree that male stereotyping\nis a terrible thing, and that it is arguably now more\nsevere than the female version, but why is the blame\nlaid solely at the female door? We bet that if Ian turned\nup to College wearing a skirt, he would soon find out\nexactly who ridiculed him the most.\nMost women have changed. They are wealthier and\nmany can provide for their own security. You don't have to be macho, rich or of low intellect to appeal\nto that type of person. Please do your bit for mankind\n(in the smallest/narrowest sense of the word) if you\nreally are 'more than willing to change'. We promise\nwe won't laugh. Go on... burn your briefcase!\nYours hopefully,\nSamantha Free, PG Elec Eng,\nKay Leedham-Green, PG Physics.\nthrough which we can give each other support and\nadvice about coming out. In an article in FELIX several\nweeks ago, Peter Brent did an admirable job in\noutlining the range of our social activities. The group\nis very informal and friendly, and of course we always\nwelcome new members.\nI hope that, as a result of the p rome nance given to\ngay issues in FELIX this term, perhaps a few more\nlesbians and gay men at Imperial, who have until now\nbeen procrastinating, will finally decide to take the\nfirst step towards coming to terms with their\nsexuality.\nThe next meeting of the ULU group is on\nWednesday evening at 7.30 in Room 2D, University\nof London Union, Malet Street, London WC1.\nYours faithfully,\nMichael Phillips,\nTreasurer ULU Lesbian & Gay Society.\nabortion to the level of a routine method of birth\ncontrol'. This is utter rubbish. It is frankly insulting to\nsuggest that a woman would go through an\nexperience as traumatic as an abortion more readily\nthan use contraceptives, how ever 'simple' it may be\nto gain permission to obtain one.\nParliament has given enough time to debating the\npros and cons of abortion. The Bill last April was\nde sig end to settle the d is put for some time to come,\nbut it appears that Mr Crompton wishes to continue\nto use emotional blackmail and arguments riddled with\ninaccuracies to put his point of view. If he must ram\nhis views down our throats at least he could try and\nuse sensible and un distorted arguments to do so. But\nof course this must be difficult for a viewpoint based\non emotional intuition rather than rational thought.\nRebecca Hardy.\nA woman's viewpoint\n\n"

The number of applicants to the\nRSM has dropped by half this year in comparison to\nlast year.\nThe money will come from privately raised funds,\naccording to the Royal School of Mines. The RSM\nhas calculated that the minimum cost of living in the\ncity is \u00a33,500 a year in comparison to the average\n\u00a3300 annual grant that IC students receive.

    "content": "The Gods Must\nBe Crazy II\nFilm\nTheatre\ni Do you remember the film about a Coke Bottle falling\nout of the sky? It caused cultural mayhem amongst\nthe bushmen of the Kalahari. In this sequel, we return\nto the same setting, with some of the same themes\n(the intrusion of western culture on the' bushmen's lives, the futility of the bush wars being fought in\nSouthern Africa) but a greater emphasis on others\n(ivory poaching).\nXixo, played by Nxau (the star of the previous film)\ngoes in search of his children Xisa and Xiri, who have\nbeen carried off on the back of an ivory poacher's truck. On the way he meets Dr Ann Taylor (Lena\nFarugia), a New York lawyer in Africa for a conference, who has crash landed in the bush whilst\non a joyride with Game Ranger Dr Stephen Marshall\n(Hans Strydom).\nAlso involved are two warring mercenaries who are\nplaying a bizarre game of hostages with each other\nand at times with Dr Taylor. Meanwhile the ivory\npoachers squabble and lose their way in the desert,\nunaware of their stowaways.\nTheir paths cross repeatedly during the film, with\nthe inevitable possibility for farce and\nmisunderstandings. All is resolved happily in the end,\nbut only after Xixo's knowledge of the bush saves\nthem from a roasting.\nThis new film, like most sequels, is much more\ncontrived than the original, but is still worth going to\nsee. The insights into life in the bush compensate for\nthe tenuous plot while there are several good comic\nsequences (watch out for the ostrich) and some well-paced tense moments. Also the photography,\nespecially of the animals, is superb.\nThis is a gently undemanding film: there's no heavy\nhanded moralizing or excessive violence. It will make\na nice evening out at the cinema.\nToby Jones and Liz\nPVT Wars\nThe agony of post-Vietnam trauma has been much\nexamined on celluloid recently, now it comes to the\nstage. Gately, Silvio and Natwick are three inmates\nof a US Army Veterans Hospital, in the 70's. Gately\nis childlike and slow without being actually stupid. He\nspends most of his time trying to rebuild a radio. Silvio\nis psychotic and spends much of his time flashing at\nnurses and discussing male underwear. Natwick is an\nuptight and spoilt rich boy, who is totally out of place\nin the army.\nOver the course of several days they start to come\nto terms with their injuries and get to know each other\nand themselves. Sounds very heavy doesn't it? Well\nactually its a dark comedy very much in the M*A*S*H vein. Thankfully though the injuries and disabilities\nthemselves of the characters are never the subject of\nthe humour, that arises from the characters'\npersonalities and misapprehensions. Targets for the\nramblings of these inmates range from Catholics\n(What's the best chat up line for a Catholic girl? Hello,\nI'm a priest.) to Scottish Perverts and Kilts through\nto sperm/salmon comparisons.\nThe play is in one act, but divided into short scenes\nlinked by audio extracts from the characters' off-stage\nlives, often humorous, often revelatory. The acting is\ngood, perhaps aided by the slight caricaturing of the\ncharacters. Initially the American accents are\noverplayed, but as the actors get into their stride\nthings settle down to become much more convincing,\nthe accents even allowing us to determine where in\nAmerica the characters come from.\nMoving, funny and tragic, this is a pretty good bit\nof theatre from The Design Art Co., and well worth\na visit.\nPVT Wars is playing in the Finbourgh Theatre,\nFinbourgh Arms Road, SW10. Nearest tube is Earls\nCourt. Turn left as you leave the station and its about\nfive minutes walk. Concessionary tickets cost \u00a33.50\n(Take student ID) and the Box Office is on 071 373\n3842.\nAdam T, Theatre\nSunday in the Park with George\nSteven Sondheim is not renowned for conventional\nmusicals. A musical about point a list painter George\nSeurat derived mainly from his painting Un Dimanche\nd'e te de la Grande Jatte is definitely not conventional.\nLittle is actually known about Seurat, and so the\nmusical is given plenty of room to mano eu ver. The\ncharacters in the first half are all drawn from the\npainting. We are given brief sketches of their\ncharacters and their reactions to being painted by\nGeorge. Principal among these is Dot, George's mistress who finds it difficult to cope with his\nobsession with the painting.\nThe first half deals with the creation of this painting,\nthe second with its recreation as a form of modern\nvisual art by the great-grandson of George, also called\nGeorge. He too has to fight the art-world\nestablishment, but the battlegrounds are now very\ndifferent.\nThe first half is bizarre-almost surrealistic. Much\nof the time we are seeing the world through George's eyes, elements of the painting dropping in and out of\nthe set as George develops the picture. Indeed, initially\nthe stage is viewed through a frame. The set becomes\n4 Page\nmore conventional as we move into the second half\nand the modern world. These at least grab you. The\nsongs don't. They are reasonably pleasant and are\ncleverly devised to fit in with what is going on stage.\nThis is the musical as it should be, the music, spoken\nword and action all complementing each other to build\nup a theme, not 'the songs are all' attitude of Mr\nLloyd-Webber and his ilk.\nWhat we have is a celebration of creation and the\ncreator. At times it tends to over glorify the suffering\nan artist endures for his art, It then begins to lose\ncredence and rather comedic and melodramatic\nstereotypes spring to one's mind. Imbued with enough\nhumour to keep it pleasantly lightweight, it is never\nboring but is rarely enrapturing either.\nThis is a pleasant and diverting piece of musical\ntheatre, and one could do worse than spend an\nevening in the National with George.\nSunday In The Park With George is showing in the\nNational Theatre's Lyttelton Theatre. Student\nStandbys cost \u00a38.\nAdam T. "

    "content": "IC takes more trash\nThe college is to have a new department\ncalled 'The Centre for Toxic Waste\nManagement'. It will be housed in the\nexisting waste laboratory in the Civil\nEngineering department.\nProfessor Roger Perry, who is leading\nthe project and is head of the the Public\nHealth group in Civil Engineering, told\nFelix that the waste used would be on a laboratory scale and no worse than can\nalready be found in laboratories on\ncampus. He said that most of the\nunpleasant work would be done in\nindustry.\nMr S Pollard, who is a postgraduate in\nthe new centre, explained that there would\nbe analysis of small quantities of chemicals\nsuch as heavy metal hydroxides. He said\nthere would be no nuclear waste involved.\nAs yet, there are no plans to include\nundergraduates, though it is possible that\nthird year projects might be based there.\nThe Rector, Sir Eric Ash said there was\na possibility that ' URO P' or the\n'Undergraduate Research Opportunities\nProgramme' may be involved in the\ncentre.\nDuring the launch of the centre, Sir\nHugh Rossi, who chaired the House of\nCommons Environmental Select\nCommittee, said that the opening signified\nan important 'milestone' in the treatment\nof industrial waste. He said that Professor\nPerry was acting as 'an entrepreneur' in\nfilling a gap in the market.\nThe centre is being sponsored by\n'Cleanaway' Ltd, the Wolfson\nFoundation, the Department of the\nEnvironment and the Science and\nEngineering Research Council amongst\nothers. 'Cleanaway' chairman Mr Peter\nHeath said that his company was\nsupporting the centre as it 'will help\nour own business.'\nUnion out on a limb\nThere have been no conciliatory moves by\nUniversity College London (UCL)\nadministration in their selling off land on\nwhich UCL Union have facilities. A spokesperson from UCL U told Felix that\nthe present facilities can hold 450 people\n- catering for about 8000 students. If the\nextra outhouses go, this will reduce the\nunion's capacity considerably.\nUCL U added that one of the condemned\nbuildings called 'The Garage' had just\nbeen refurbished and that another, the\nGym, was in constant use as an\nexamination hall, especially this time of\nthe year. They said that all their rooms\nwere stretched to full use, and the loss of\nspace would be fatal to a number of\nUCL U clubs.\nThe land is destined to be used by the\nMedical Research Council (MRC) and a pharmaceutical company, 'Eisai'. Mr Fred\nAtkins, a consultant to Eisai told Felix that\nthe affair was 'between the Provost and\nthe students.' He added that 'if any\ncompany becomes involved with a university we don't want students\nexcluded' and that Eisai had already got\na facility in Harvard University in the\nUSA.\nMr Cox from the MRC said that 'it's a domestic affair' and that although\nnothing was definite the redevelopment\nwas 'likely to happen'.\nNeil McCluskey of IC union\ncommented that 'it's rather worrying that\na college sells off bits of land belonging\nto a student union.' Mr Angus Fraser, IC\nManaging Director, said that it was 'not\na current plan' to move or reduce IC\nUnion facilities.\nMedical winners\nSimon Smith will be next year's President\nof St Mary's Hospital Medical School\nStudent Union after beating Roger Walsh\nwith 240 votes against 119. The election\nsaw 65% of the students voting for some\nstrongly contested posts.\nPeter Dzendrowskyj won the contest for\nVice President (Internal and Secretary)\nwith 192 votes to Dermot McGovern's172. Lisa Pitkin sailed through the election\nfor treasurer, after a year as Mary's Rag\ntreasurer, with 209 votes to Richard\nEdwards' 69 and Andrew Hodgeson's64 votes.\nThe Editor of the Newspaper for the\nNational Association of Medical Students\n(NAMS News), Nick Stafford, won the\nelection for BM A representative with 306\nvotes against Marcus Harbord's61.

    "content": "All's Well That Ends Well\nThe Barbican Stage is an open stage. This means that\nthere is no curtain. This, in turn, means that the\ndirector often decides to have some action on stage\nbefore the lights dim. Two children playing with toy\nsoldiers on a table top, on a stage that has echoes of\na playroom (the giant rocking horse sort of gives it\naway). The lights finally dim, the kids scar per, the\ndoors swing shut and the play begins.\nHelena is the ward of the Countess Rossilon, whose\nson, Bertram, is leaving for the French court, there to\nreplace his late father. Helena is in love with Bertram,\nbut feels herself immeasurably below him in status.\nThus she also sets off for the court, planning to use\none of her father's old remedies to cure the ailing king.\nThis she does and as a reward he allows her to pick\nfreely of the young male nobility for a husband.\nObviously she picks Bertram, who is not well pleased.\nRefusing to consummate the marriage, he leaves for\nthe Italian Wars, vowing never to accept Helena as\nhis wife until she has his ancestral ring and a child\nconceived of him...\nAdmittedly, the first half of this play made it\nabundantly clear that this was the weak link in the\npresent Barbican chain. The principle fault was with\nthe text of the play itself, not one of Shakespeare's best and more than a little turgid. Unfortunately, the\ncompany go all out to make it more interesting with\nsoldiers sliding down 'death slides' and highly\npretentious and arty use of mirrors and childhood\nfairytale allusions. One is left positively looking\nforward to the interval.\nThe second half is almost a different play. The\nstandard leaps back up to that of As You Like It, as\nthe cast work wonders with some very funny lines.\nThe plot is resolved nicely and movingly, if a trifle\nunconvincingly and the whole play is brought to a satisfying conclusion. Perhaps it can truly said that\nAll's Well That Ends Well.\nAdam T. The\nKill-Off\nTheatre\nA Little Night Magic\nThe evening at the Drill Hall Arts centre (near Goodge\nSt. Tube) starts with Fay Presto, com per e and\nmagic i enne, performing impromptu card tricks and\n'vanishing 10p piece' tricks to small groups in the bar\nand then in the theatre just as the audience are taking\ntheir seats. But with an inanimate puppet of Paul\nDaniels irreverently strung up from the ceiling we pick\nup that this is not an evening of the conventional TV\nmagic that I'm sure bores most students silly.\nAlong with Fay we have the rest of the Presto Pack.\nRichard McDougall, a magician/mime artist who,\ndespite a dubious sense of humour, is in general\namusing and fairly professional. And then there's 'Fluke' an impressive acrobat/contortionist who puts\non a spectacular visual display combining magic,\nmusic and movement verging on the psychedelic.\nThere's also a pianist who provides entertaining\nmusical accompaniment giving the whole show a quasi-cabaret feel.\nBut Fay is undoubtedly the star of the show. The\nrecent rather unfair and out of touch decision by the\nall-male Magic Circle to expel her for being female is\nno reflection on her skill as an illusionist. Although she\nuses somewhat traditional props (like a saw-in-half\nbox for example), most of her tricks are both good and\noriginal, enhanced by her ever present comic touch.\nOne minute you're spellbound by her tricks and the\nnext you're cracking up at some throwaway remark.\nA light evening of magical cabaret therefore, which\nincidentally is in one of the friendliest venues I 've\nvisited in a long time.\nA Little Night Magic on until 28th May with tickets\nat \u00a34.00 (concession). The Drill Hall Arts Centre box\noffice is on 071- 637-8270.\nAdrian Pagan.\nby Jim Thompson\nCrime novels have never appealed to me, people only\nseem able to write Sam Spade or Poirot copies\ncomplete with the stereotypical butler, rich landowner\nand assorted incidental characters. Jim Thompson is\nsupposed to be different and his style certainly is.\nEach chapter is written through the eyes of a different character, each telling the same facts as they\neffected them. This creates an unusual feel to the\nbook that makes it interesting, if a little difficult to\nread. The difficulty arises when you are halfway\nthrough a chapter and you forget who it is about, is\nit the lawyer, the local drunk or perhaps the victim to\nbe?\nMentioning the victim, there's another oddity about\nthis book. In most crime novels, at least those that\ncontain a murder, the event takes place within ten\npages, if not in the second line. Call me old-fashioned\nif you like but leaving the actual death until over three\nquarters of the way through is cutting things a bit fine.\nAdd to this the fact that the police, the doctor and\nthe deceased's lawyer all initially think that it was an\naccident the last forty pages make for a very week\nending to what was otherwise a very good book.\nThere are a nice assortment of characters that all\nseem to have a chip on their shoulder, interacting to\ngive a balanced impression of life in a small American\ntown with all the seedy happenings that are always\njust below the surface. There is the local gossip that\nspreads nasty rumours via the telephone, the\nillegitimate son who is a bad egg, spending most of\nhis spare time drunk and the out of town lawyer that\nthe local attorney is scared stiff of.\nWithout the week ending this book would have\nbeen quite good, although not as brilliant as the\nreviews would have you believe. The style is unusual\nand perhaps this is the best reason to read it.\nIan Hodge.\n\n"

    "content": "Imperial College\nObviously, it is of interest to the Imperial College\ncommunity whether the implementation of such a scheme is feasible at IC. After all, the financial\nsituation of most London Universities is worsening:\nGovernment funding is down (although some\nUniversities benefit from research awards and other\nspecial grants) and deficits are up. For the students,\nthe picture is not any brighter: rents are up, the Poll\nTax will have to be paid at some stage, and next year\nhousing benefit will be gone and student loans will\nmake their introduction.\nHowever, IC does not even have a hardship fund\nyet. Whilst next year, the Government will replace\nstudent benefits by the access fund, which is to be\nsplit up amongst university institutions across the\ncountry, Imperial College has not yet made any claims,\nor provided a framework for the allocation of the\nmonies to students.\nThe IC Scholarship Office is a one man organisation.\nIt supports and coordinates the applications of\npostgraduates for further studies and research money.\nYet even though the office has never been set up to\ncater for undergraduates - who are expected to find\noutside sponsorship by themselves - it could develop\nits role and expand, to handle all these monies which\nHM Government does not want to look after anymore.\nIt does not also require a lot of imagination to see that,\nnot too far in the future, even British students will\nhave to rely on scholarships and loans alone.\nIncreasing fees\nWhatever policy IC adopts, however, the financial\nsituation of IC and the LSE can not be simply\ncompared. IC cannot merely copy the remedies the\nLSE has found to its problems. IC receives a lot of\nmoney for research and from awards. Much use is\nmade of expensive capital equipment and the tuition\nfees for overseas students are already high (\u00a35,800)\nin relation to other institutions. The academics at the\nLSE study and teach mostly social sciences and rely\non their brain power.\nAt IC, top slicing the fee paid by the overseas\nstudent would be an alternative. Imperial College\ncould start by putting 2 or 3% of the overseas\nstudents tuition fees aside to create a scholarship\nfund. It could expand its Scholarship Office. It could\nattract more monies from industry for scholarships.\nAnd it should begin by creating a hardship fund. Yet\nwhatever initiative is taken, it must come from the\nadministration. Proposals from the side of the\nStudents Union would simply be brushed away if the\norganisation of these changes proved too complex\nand expensive. They would also come too late. At this\nstage, bickering between the Students Union and the\nCollege administration must be avoided. That is why\naction must be taken now.\nFinally, some communication between the\ncounterparts in the two institutions' administrations\ncould provide some food for thought for the scientists\nand technocrats in South Kensington; after all, they\nare both part of the London University. Maybe this\ndoes require immediate attention, because IC students\nwill soon face financial hardship. In this context, the\nwords of the director of a leading French university\nare quite appropriate. On the subject of Universities,\nhe said, 'Une institution qui ne respect e pas ses\net udi ants, ne respect e pas le s a voir.', for which no\nequivalent translation in English exists.\n\n"

    "content": "Overseas Students Committee Chairman, Wouter van Hulten, investigates fees and hardship fun\nLondon School of Economics. What are the implications for IC, he asks...\nOverseas fees at IC\nCosts are on the increase and they do not show any\nsign of slowing down in the near future. Everyone is\naffected by this trend in the economy, students and\nUniversities alike.\nWhile other Universities are simply increasing their\ntuition fees to keep up with inflation, the London\nSchool of Economics has come up with a more\ningenious plan. Over the next three years, the LSE will\nbe increasing its overseas students fees by more than\ninflation. The plan has arisen from discussions of the\nWorking Party on Overseas' Students Tuition Feesmade up of Academic and Administrative Members\nof the School and student representatives of the\nStudents Union. Whether such a plan is viable for\nimplementation at Imperial College is questionable,\nsince the tuition fees at IC are already far above those\nof the LSE. Yet they may suggest a direction for IC\nto follow.\nThe strategy developed, and recently adopted, has\nthree aims: first of all, to cover inflation; secondly, to\ncover the funding 'gap' between fees charged to\noverseas students and the cost of their education and\nthirdly, to create a fund for scholarships acc es i ble to\nall students. The latter point is in addition to the\nhardship funds which the LSE has already created, in\nview of the disappearing student benefits in 1990/91.\nHardship, Scholarship and Access Funds\nCurrently, the 4500 students attending the London\nSchool of Economics can apply for aid from a hardship\nfund, bursa ries and scholarships. The hardship fund\nand additional scholarships were created by the\nSchool in 1981 in response to the introduction of the\nOverseas Students Fees by the Government. The\nSchool makes an annual contribution of \u00a3200,000 to\nthe fund, appropriately named the '1980's Fund'. LSE\nstudents make their application for financial aid\nthrough the LSE Scholarship Office.\nFrom next year, the School will also be making\nclaims from the access funds which the Government\nis providing. These new funds have been set up\nbecause of the removal of all student benefits, which,\namongst others, include the housing benefit. The\naccess funds amount to \u00a325m, which is to be\ndistributed nationally; last year, the benefits claimed\nby students totalled \u00a369m. Again, students will be able to apply for help\nthrough the Scholarship Office. Because of its\nexpanded role, the Office will attract one more\nmember of staff this year, thus increasing its number\nof staff to four.\nHow will it work?\nFor the 1989/90 academic year, overseas students\nat the LSE pay an average of \u00a34,874. Next year, this\nfigure will be increased by 13% (6% above expected\ninflation) of which 4.5% will go to the scholarship\nfund. In the following years, the overall increase will\nslowly be reduced. In three years time, fees will\naverage \u00a36,847, and the scholarship fund will have\nbeen endowed around \u00a31m. Further details are shown\nin the table below.\nm Year Tuition fee for Scholarship\nOverseas Students Fund\n(\u00a3) (\u00a3)\n1989 4,874 70,000\n1990 5,508 321,200\n1991 6,169 668,680\n1992 6,847 1,033,680\n(The tuition fee is the average of the fee charged for\none-year and longer courses.)\nWhy increase fees?\nThe reasoning behind the increases is to safeguard the\nSchool's financial position. At this moment, the\noverseas student pays less than the income the\nSchool receives for the European Community (home)\nstudents. This 'gap' will be closed. The 'gap' is the\ndifference between the fees charged to overseas\nstudents and the cost of their education, the latter\nbeing defined as,\nUFC funded numbers of home/EC students\nIUFC: Universities Funding Council)\nThe LSE working party also noticed that the general\nlevel of fees charged by UK universities is around\n\u00a3 6 0 0 0 , which is found supportable by most\napplicants. The School is mainly an institution for the\nsocial sciences, and its fees are substantially lower\nthan the national average. Thus, the LSE does not\nexpect a reduction in the number of overseas students\nas a result of its fees increase.\nThe scholarship fund is intended to be need-based,\nand students will be awarded financial aid before\narriving at the School. As a by-product of the\nincreased attractiveness of the School to potential\nstudents, this will also entail an increase in academic\nquality.\n7 Page\n\n"
