The rec-tor, Sir Roy Anderson, said in an email\nearlier this week to all members of staff\nthat \u201cWhilst Imperial College\u2019s immediate outlook for this year and the next\nis one of good health, it is incumbent\non us to adopt a responsible and precautionary approach\u201d.\nAs an initial step, all faculties, de-partments, divisions and nonacademic\nfunctions have been told to assume\na 5% decrease in next years budget\ncompared to this year. As a more immediate effect, the College has decided\nto stop hiring external nonacademic\nstaff, however, the rector did say that\nthe College will continue to \u201csupport\nacademic recruitment where opportunities arise for us to bring outstanding\nindividuals to the College and to sustain our excellence\u201d.\nThe overall aim of the cuts are to\ncreate a surplus in the budget so that\nthe College could handle the expected\n\u201csqueeze in UK public funding\u201d. In the\nemail, the rector went on to say that\nthis will hopefully \u201cstrengthen the College so we can take advantage of the\neconomic recovery when it comes\u201d.\nAs a closing statement, Sir Roy Anderson stated that \u201cImperial College\nis certainly in a position to help the\nUK economy - we translate research\ndiscoveries into innovations and form\nspin out companies; we contribute to\nsolving global problems, and we continue to attract to the UK the highest\nquality students from wherever they\nmay be found in the world.\u201d\nHe went on to say \u201cOur mission\nand objectives remain the same and I\nhope all will understand that by taking\nthese prudent measures at this time we\nare collectively helping to protect the\nCollege from further, and potentially\ngreater, perturbations.\u201d\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nImperial College Union [ICU] Clubs\n& Societies and Imperial College Careers Advisory Service have come to a\ndisagreement over room bookings and\nexternal companies.\nAccording to their web site, the\nImperial Careers Advisory Service\n\u2018provides a varied and comprehensive careers guidance, information\nand vacancy service for all students\nand alumni of Imperial College, from\nfirst to final year undergraduates and\npostgraduates.\u2019 One of the methods by\nwhich they accomplish this is by organising career talks by a wide range of\ncompanies.\nIn a similar fashion, several of the\nICU Clubs & Societies offer the opportunity for students to interact with\nlike minded people, as well as potential\nemployers. These societies, such as the\nFinance Society and the Consultancy\nSociety who have both been described\nas \u201cCareer Clubs\u201d, have the luxury of\nfree room booking around the College\nwhich they use to organise events with\nvarious firms. In contrast, the Careers\nAdvisory Service would charge the\nvarious companies for room bookings.\nThe fact that Clubs & Societies were\nbooking rooms for talks by external\ncompanies only became apparent after\nthe Finance Society told the company\nto organise catering themselves, after\nwhich they called the Conference department at Imperial who informed the\nCareers Advisory Service. As a result,\nthe booking of College space for talks\nby graduate recruiters is now under\nreview, with Deputy President (Clubs\n& Societies) Lily Topham planning to\nattend a meeting with the relevant College departments next week. A possible outcome of the meeting could be a\nbanning of graduate recruitment talks.\nThe outcome of that meeting could\nhave severe implications to the funding\nprovided to many Clubs and Societies\nat Imperial. Although societies such\nas Finance and Consultancy use the\nmoney given by the various companies\nto solely arrange \u2018career\u2019 events, others\nrely on the money for the day to day\nrunning of the club. This is particularly\nevident in the clubs that are part of the\nAthletic Clubs Committee [ACC] who\nneed the money to simply function.\nEvery club or society at Imperial is\nentitled to funding from the Union, to\ncover the expenses, however for many\nof these clubs or societies, the funding\nprovided is not enough and as such\nlook for funding from external sources.\nFrom the graduate recruiters point of\nview, being able to target students on\nmany small scales seems advantageous\nas they can target specific groups, as\nwell as saving money on hiring costs.\nFrom the individual club or societies\npoint of view, they receive sponsorship\nwhich they can then use to stay afloat.\nThe implications of banning the\ntalks could prove costly to many clubs\nand societies who desperately rely\non the money provided by graduate\nrecruiters.\nImperial to set up overseas\ncampus in near future\nKadhim Shubber\nDeputy Editor\nIn an interview with the Financial\nTimes, Rector Sir Roy Anderson gave\nthe strongest signal yet that Imperial is planning to set up an overseas\ncampus.\nSites being considered for a possible\noverseas campus include China, India,\nSingapore or an Arab Emirate, specifically Qatar or Abu Dhabi.\nSir Roy told the Financial Times\n\u201cThe question in mind is whether we\nshould have a formal campus overseas\u201d\nand that such a move would \u201cnot [be]\nworth doing unless we do it in hundreds [of students].\u201d\nHe rejected concerns that an overseas endeavour might reduce the quality of its flagship South Kensington\ncampus, saying that Imperial would\nnot be considering an expansion if\nsuch a risk existed. Sir Roy said that he\nwas confident the high-quality of Imperial\u2019s applicants would prevent this\nfrom happening.\nFinancial concerns have also motivated the plans for a new overseas\ncampus; it is hoped that a surplus\nwould me made from such a campus\nthat could be re-invested in Imperial\u2019s\nLondon base.\nSir Roy also indicated that Imperial\nmay increase the proportion of fee-paying non-EU students to increase\nrevenue if government funding was\nreduced due to the recession.\nThe Rector had previously alluded\nto plans for an overseas campus in his\nspeech at Commemoration Day last\nOctober.\nHe was much more cautious in his\nspeech than in his FT interview, speaking of \u201cthe possibility of establishing\nImperial \u2018footprints\u2019 overseas.\u201d\nHe left the door open for smaller\noverseas ventures such as \u201ccollaborative research facilities or Faculties\nfor undergraduate and postgraduate training in partnership with local\nUnion \u2018security\u2019 has taken hits from\nall flanks this last fortnight. Last week\nsaw the Union Server\u2019s database security infiltrated, but now it is the actual\nphysical presence of Beit Quad\u2019s security that is in question.\nComputers in the Union Office have\nbeen stolen during the afternoon of\nSunday the 1st of February. At 5pm the\nUnion Office, based on the 1st floor\nof the Union Building, were found to\nbe subject to forced entry. It is unconfirmed if the main entrance was left\nunlocked or forced open at this stage.\nDeputy President (Clubs & Societies) Lily Topham was said to have left\nat 2.55pm, and was confident that she\nhad locked up both her internal office door and the main entrance door.\nUpon returning at around 5pm, both\nher own and Deputy General Manager,\nRobin Pitt\u2019s internal office doors were\nfound to have been forcibly opened,\nand an iMac from each office taken.\nComputers stolen\nfrom Union offices\nThe internal doors to Union President and Deputy President (Finances\n& Services) offices show evidence of\nattempted forced entry, but after in-spection, the main entrance doors\nshowed no signs of damage. This leaves\nthe issue of whether the door was left\nunlocked within the time period Ms.\nTopham was absent. An unnamed\nUnion Entertainment staff member\nwas said to have opened up the offices\nwithin this time period.\nThe two iMacs taken contained little\nvaluable data themselves, as all important documentation is stored on the\nUnion Servers, rather than directly on\nthe iMac hard drives. Though CCTV\nfootage is still to be studied, the thieves\nare reckoned to have escaped via the\nback entrance of the Union onto Kensington Gore.\nImperial College Union President\nJenny Morgan stated that the Union\nwas now under \u201can immediate security\nreview\u201d and that Office members were\n\u201cdisappointed, but feel lucky it was not\na bigger loss.\u201d\nLast weeks front page image seems so fitting don\u2019t you think\n15a Harrington Road\nSouth Kensington\nLondon SW7 3ES\n(1 Minute walk from\nSouth Kensington Tube)\nCASH ONLY\n\u2018Still the best student\noffer in South\nKensington!\u2019\nONLY BY EXPERIENCED STYLISTS\n\u00a326* .....

RAG is one\nweek of the year where anything goes\nfrom throwing pies at the rector and\nbuilding human pyramids in Trafalgar\nSquare to making the Union President\naudition for X-Factor in spandex.\nThis year, RAG week is raising money for Banardos, Shelter and the Rainbow Trust (see next week\u2019s felix for information on the charities).\nImperial College Unions\u2019s RAG has a\ndepressing history of being overshadowed by the medic\u2019s RAG. Determined\nto prove that the rest of Imperial are\njust as charitable the medical school,\nUnion President, Jenny Morgan and\nthe rest of Imperial College Union have\npledged to support this years RAG,\neven bringing in a laser quest to the\nUnion Quad on the Wednesday night!\nHaving already raised almost \u00a32500\nRAG, over 100 people signed up for\nRAG week at freshers fair (though it\u2019s\npossible this was just on the promise\nof a free t-shirt), if each of you who\nsigned up raised \u00a310 that would be another \u00a31000! Better still, (according to\nJov) 8000 of you are reading this paper\n(well not THIS paper, but a copy of this\npaper), if each of you gave up an hour\nor two of your lives to shake a tin at a\ntube station, do silly challenges during\nRAG RAID or just have a few goes on\nthe laser quest and raise \u00a310 each, that\nwould be \u00a380,000! Ok, so perhaps I\u2019m\ngetting ahead of myself...\nBesides being fun, taking part in\nevents during RAG week takes the guilt\nout of avoiding the gaze of a homeless\nperson or of leaving half a plate of nice\nfood with your mothers voice saying\n\u2018there are children starving in the third\nworld you know!\u2019 ringing in your ear.\nThere is something for everyone to\ntake part in, including challenges to\ncomplete around London in the RAG\nRAID, a pub crawl with the IC Rugby\nClub to collect in pubs around South\nKen. Or you could buy yourself a slave\nin the CGCU slave auction, attend the\nRCSU club night in the award winning\nMaya in Soho, or simply take a lunchtime tour of the Queens Tower.\nAlice Rowlands\nNews Correspondent\nStudents at one of the career fairs\nSir Roy Anderson outlining the financial plan\n\n"

David\nWallis, our resident Gastronaught,\nknows how to do just that \u2013 his lentil\ndish is bound to warm you right to the\ncockles... whatever that means. Our Viking cousins also know how to do cold\nweather food, as I discovered when I\nvisited Masden, our new local Scandinavian restaurant. It turns out that\nit isn\u2019t all meatballs and reindeer and\nbanana curry (long story). Incidentally,\nthe Scandinavians also know how to\ndo student discounts, so please take\nadvantage of the offer in February. Just\ncut out the voucher below and have a\ngood old Viking time! Meanwhile, enjoy the snow and good luck with trying out that old \u201cmy problem sheet is\nsnowed in\u201d excuse.\nJust going out for a Danish\nin ten minutes or it\u2019s free\u201d tag line. For\nthis you get two reduced sized Sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d and a drink which isn\u2019t at all bad\nfor South Kensington.\nOf course, Masden isn\u2019t just a cool\ncaf\u00e9. When the sun sets and the candles\narelitonthesustainablysourcedwood-en tables, the room is transformed into\na romantic, yet welcoming restaurant,\nserving hearty Scandinavian meals\nat great value for money. It was this\nwarm atmosphere that drew Hungry\nAccomplice and I through Masden\u2019s\ndoors, like moths to the flame. The\nsimple wooden Scandinavian d\u00e9cor of\nthe dining room works very well with\nthe flickering tea lights and reflects the\ncompletely unpretentious nature of the\nrestaurant and the cuisine it serves. All\nin all, the ambience in the restaurant is\nrelaxed and natural \u2013 the perfect antidote to a stressful working day.\nHungry and I chose from the evening\na la carte menu which is a mix of traditional Scandinavian and just wholesome dishes of meat, veg and potatoes.\nNow, I always judge a restaurant by its\nbread. After ordering, a plate of warm\nbread arrived at our table. This scored\ntop marks as it reminds me of eating\nhomemade bread straight out of the\noven with salty butter. Soon after, our\nfishy starters arrived. Hungry Accomplice has only just become a fish convert but he tucked into his soft cheese\nfilled salmon with relish. The salmon\nwas thick, generous and extremely\nfresh \u2013 just close your eyes and think\nof Sweden! My herring was sweet and\ndelicious and I enjoyed the rye bread\ncroutons that accompanied it. Not only\nwere our starters delicious but both\nplates were very pleasing on the eye,\nwhich is half the fun of eating out, I\nthink. It\u2019s just not the same eating your\nown creations which look like they\u2019ve\nbeen presented by a three year-old!\nNow, whenever someone mentions \u2018Wednesday\u2019 we automatically\nthink Orange. At Masden, it is Danish Wednesdays when the daily special\ncomes from Denmark, while SwedMadsen HHHHH\n20 Old Brompton Road, SW7\n3DL\n020 7225 2772\nwww.masdenrestaurant.com\nBest: The Danish Beefburger\nWorst: Being unable to finish the\nepic dessert!\nPrice: \u00a325 per head\nish Tuesdays follow the same pattern.\nHungry went for the Danish Wednesdays\u2019 dish as soon as our waitress said\nthe words \u201cthick bacon\u201d. For a big rugby\nplayer like Hungry, nothing could make\nhim happier than a plate full of inch-thick bacon, a huge bowl of potatoes\nand a jug of parsley sauce. However all\nHungry could say on the subject of his\nmain course was \u201cMwohwhmmh\u201d. My\nreaction was similar (albeit more lady-like) when my Hakkeb\u00f8f med bl\u00f8de l\u00f8g\narrived. The menu\u2019s translation of this\ndish as a \u201cbeefburger with gravy\u201d gave\nthis traditional dish no credit \u2013 it was\npossibly the best meat dish I have ever\neaten. The \u201cburger\u201d was juicy, mouthwatering and accompanied with a\nperfect balance of onion and delicious\ngravy. I enjoyed the accompaniment\nof beetroot and plentiful potatoes especially as it made the meal extremely\ngood value for money.\nWhen you think of Scandinavia, you\ntend to think of endless forests, saunas,\nlakes and meatballs. Puddings do not\ntend to come to mind. The people at\nMasden clearly wish to dispense with\nthis stereotype and serve epic Scandinavian desserts. Perhaps we have just\nbecome used to weedy puddings at\nrestaurants but I was surprised when\na pile of caramel parfait and yoghurt\narrived at my plate. No complaints\nabout the dessert itself \u2013 the yoghurt\nwas marshmallow-fluffy and the par-fait, addictive \u2013 but there was just too\nmuch of it! Even Hungry struggled\nwith the traditional \u00c6blekage, a simple\npot of stewed apples and cream.\nBut if the only complaint I can make\nis one of too much dessert, then I can\u2019t\nsee any problem in giving Masden\nfive full felix stars. Charlotte, the restaurant\u2019s founder, is a charming and\nknowledgable host and was happy to\ntell us about the cuisine of Scandinavia and about her restaurant. I will\ndefinitely be going again to Masden,\nand if it was up to me it would be Danish Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays,\nThursdays\u2026 You get the idea.\nL\nads, we\u2019re going out for a\nDanish\u201d are not words we\noften hear in this country.\nDespite being just a short\ndistance across a cold pond\nto the shores of Scandinavia, we would\nmore often choose to eat food from\n3000 miles away in the Far East rather\nthan from our neighbours. However,\nthis is the joy of living in London \u2013 you\ncan experience a thousand cultures in\njust one neighbourhood.\nJust opposite the Lamborghini ga-rage, Masden is the new kid on the\nblock in the heart of multicultural\nSouth Kensington, and I can describe\nit in no more than a word \u2013 cool. By\nday, Masden is a chic caf\u00e9 serving hefty\nportions of Danish lunchtime Sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d to famished workers and stu-dents. Sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d means \u201cbread and\nbutter\u201d but the vast quantity of sandwich in Masden\u2019s Sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d makes\nthis translation from the Danish rather\nmeasly! As expected with the clean and\ncrisp characteristics of Scandinavian\nfood, fresh rye or sourdough bread is\ntopped with a healthy pile of toppings\n\u2013 herring, roast beef, salmon, egg\u2026 It\nmakes me especially happy that this\nfresh, more-ish lunch, is available for\nthe same price as the equivalent at Pret\na Rubbish over the road.\nLunch at Masden is not just about\nopen sandwiches, however. Hot lunches are also available to suppress those\nrumbling lunchtime tummies. If you\u2019re\nin a hurry, Masden offer a quick lunch\nfor a tenner with the obligatory \u201cserved\nThis lentil stew works really well on its own with a hunk of bread or\nwith some grilled meat.

Add the vegetables and herbs (don\u2019t add the mushrooms just yet). Cook for 5 or so minutes, stirring occasionally until\nsoftened but not coloured. Now add the mushrooms and cook for\nanother 2-3 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt and a few turns of\nthe pepper mill. Add the wine. Simmer for 5 minutes to allow some\nof the wine to cook off. Meanwhile, check to see if the lentils are\ncooked (taste a couple \u2013 they should be quite soft but still retain a bit\nof bite) and, if so, remove from the heat and drain. If the lentils need\nfurther cooking, return to the heat and turn down the pan containing\nyour other ingredients. Remove the bay leaves, rosemary and thyme\nstalks where possible.

    "content": "Clubs & Societies Is your club cooler than the cat that\ngot the cream? Write to us.\nclubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nClubs & Socs Editor - Alice Rowlands\nAll in a weekend for fellwanderers\nHeather Jones reports on the Fellwanderers\u2019 weekend trip to the Yorkshire Dales\nI\nt was not an auspicious start.\nMaybe the seven fellwanderers\nwho dropped out before we departed on Friday night had some\ninkling of what was in store for\nthose who braved the Yorkshire Dales\nat the end of November, hoping for\ncrisp blue skies and beautiful views.\nThe exodus from London was\nstraightforward and both minibuses\nmade good time to Warwick where we\nstopped to visit a fish-and-chip shop\nfor dinner. The first error of the trip\nwas made after Warwick; the fish and\nchips clearly having addled Nathaniel\u2019s\nbrain causing the second minibus to\nmiss the junction for the M6 and take\na 10-mile detour via Burton-on-Trent\nbefore rejoining the motorway.\nContinuing north it was the turn of\nthe other bus to take the scenic route\nand after persevering down some very\nicy and steep single-track roads both\nbuses arrived in Garsdale together. Although the gap through the hall\u2019s gate\nposts was perilously close to the width\nof a Union minibus both drivers managed to safely negotiate the minibuses\ninto the parking field, where it soon\nbecame apparent that they weren\u2019t\ngoing to escape so easily. So, after a\ngood measure of pushing and spinning\nwheels, we retired for the night hoping\nfor the ground to freeze enough to get\nthe buses out in the morning...\nUpon entering the hall it didn\u2019t take\nlong for suspicions about the water\nsupply to be aroused. The bathrooms\nsmelt unpleasantly of sulphur, in fact,\nall running water at Garsdale\u2019s village\nhall smelt the same and occasionally\nhad peculiar black flecks in it for added\ninterest. I persevered and brushed my\nteeth with it (trying hard not to notice\nthe black bits). Others, wisely, were\nnot so brave and used the little water\nwe had brought from London. So, with\nthe grim sceptre of contaminated water and the possibility of no transport\nthe next morning, we went to sleep,\nat least those with good sleeping bags\ndid\u2026 the heaters in the hall weren\u2019t\nproducing quite as much heat as some\nof us would have liked\u2026\nThe next morning we boiled the\nwater and hoped that despite the lingering smell we would have killed anything dangerous. With water supply\nissues \u201csolved\u201d, attention turned to the\nbuses. Luckily the ground had frozen\novernight and while one bus escaped\nrelatively easily the other required a\nlittle more coaxing. Eventually it was\njacked up, and a road was built beneath\nits back wheels allowing us all to drive\nto the start of our walk, Kilnsey\u2026\nOr maybe not. The first bus, driven\nby Nathaniel and Rachel, thought we\nwere all going to Kilnsey. We were.\nHowever, bus two driven by Rafal and\nChris took an alternative route and\nwhen the first bus saw it turning off the\nroad they were confused into thinking it was heading to not-so nearby\nMalham and went there instead. Forty\nminutes and a number of confused\ncalls and texts later, it was discovered\nthat bus one was in Malham and bus\ntwo was in Kilnsey. Happily, this gave\nthe Kilnsey bus time to visit nearby\nGrassington to buy essentials such\nas chocolate and drinking water, plus\nsqueeze in a pre-walk hot chocolate at\nthe pub, conveniently making us pub\npatrons so we could leave the buses in\ntheir car park.\nEventually we were reunited and\nbegan walking. Due to cold, clear and\nmercifully dry weather, the views were\nbeautiful although the dying rabbit\nlying in the middle of the path dampened the mood a little. We stopped for\nlunch at Malham Tarn, and admired\nthe thin layer of ice over the lake as we\nate. Most people had decided against\ndrinking any more of the water from\nthe hall by this point. However, this\nprecautionary measure came too late\nfor Jim. Shortly after lunch he felt so ill\nit was decided that he and some others\nwould return to the bus directly instead\nof completing the walk. Those continuing decided to take the path rated as\n\u201cdifficult\u201d down to Malham pub from\nwhich a couple of people could be dispatched to walk back collect and the\nother minibus.\nThe \u201cdifficult\u201d path kept giving\nwarnings of how challenging the descent was going to be and as we got\ncloser and closer to an impressively\nsteep-looking gorge we realised that\nwe needed to get to the bottom. As the\nsun got lower and lower in the sky, it\nbecame apparent that the warnings of\ndifficulty perhaps should have been\nheeded as we effectively climbed down\na waterfall clinging onto freezing, wet\nrocks. It took the intrepid scramblers\nthe best part of an hour to go less than\n100m down the waterfall but having\nsafely made it at dusk the fellwander-ers were split into three groups; Jim\u2019s\ngroup, the group on the way to the\npub and the group going back across\nthe moors for the other minibus. After some amusing walking across the\nmoors in winter, at night with no light,\nwe were all reunited at the pub and set\noff back to Garsdale for dinner.\nThe drive back to the hall was interesting to say the least. The roads were\nextremely icy and steep, with what I\nconsider inadequate protection from\ndrops on either side. At one point we\nstopped on the way up a hill, put the\nbrakes and found we were still moving\u2026 back down the hill. However\nthanks to some very skilled, although\nat times alarming, driving we all made\nit back to the hall ready for dinner.\nWe decided to get cleaner water to\ncook dinner with and it was at this\npoint that we realised how peculiarly\nempty Garsdale was. Sure there were\nhouses, but there was no evidence that\nany of them actually had residents.\nUpon knocking on the door of one\nhouse we were met by a lone man in a\nhalf-renovated house with what looked\nsuspiciously like a sniper rifle sitting in\none corner. After revealing he hadn\u2019t\nspoken to anyone all day he proceeded\nto make us feel comfortable in Garsdale\nby telling stories of the babies\u2019 bones\nthat had been found at the abortionist\u2019s\nhouse in the village and the supposedly\nhaunted village hall\u2026\nThe excitement for the evening was\nnot yet over though. After dinner,\nwhilst the playing the traditional werewolf game, an ex-Imperial student who\nhappened to be passing by and noticed\nthe minibuses came in to let us know\nwhere the best places to walk were.\nHe seemed to assume (correctly) that\nwalking unannounced into a village\nhall in the middle of nowhere at midnight wouldn\u2019t be a problem for any-one. However, his advice on the best\nwalks to do in the area was gratefully\nreceived and Sunday\u2019s walk was more\nchallenging, but also more spectacular,\nthan Saturday\u2019s.\nOn Sunday we gained enough height\nto have a clear view of the Lake District, Howgill Fells, the Pennines and\nthe Dales and were treated to snow at\nthe top for our banner photo. Everyone\nwas happy that the stunning weather\ncontinued although high morale on\nSunday may also have had something\nto do with squeezing in a second breakfast at a caf\u00e9 before the walk. At this\ncaf\u00e9 the reason for our hall\u2019s dodgy water supply became apparent. The caf\u00e9\nowners told us that Garsdale didn\u2019t\nhave mains water and all the water they\nused came off the mountains and was\nfiltered to become drinkable. Interestingly, being from Imperial, we took a\nwater sample and upon analysis found\nthat it did actually meet the minimum\nstandards for drinking water.\nHappy fellwanderers got back into\nthe buses on Sunday afternoon having had a lovely walk and were eagerly\nlooking forward to a well-deserved pub\ndinner. Sadly this was not to be. Whilst\ndriving along a single track bridge on\nthe way to the M6 the car in front of\none of the minibuses stopped suddenly.\nThe brakes were slammed on and we\nstopped in time but couldn\u2019t pass it and\nwere shocked when an angry man got\nout and started running at the bus waving his fist! In a moment of panic the\ndriver reversed to try and get away and\nunfortunately bumped the car behind\nhim. The crazy man in front saw this,\nlaughed and drove away before anyone\ncould do anything. The car behind was\nalmost undamaged but unfortunately\nthe minibus had a significant dent in\nit\u2026 As time passed sorting things out,\nthe chances of a well deserved-pub\nmeal were diminishing but we needn\u2019t\nhave worried. All hopes of a pub meal\nwere dashed as we entered truly horrific traffic. Due to an accident on the\nM6 a whole junction was closed and\nthe motorway was backed up, practically stationary, for miles. We managed to crawl just three miles in three\nhours, in the cripplingly cold (at the\nback of the buses at least) and mind-numbingly boring traffic jam with the\nonly points of interest being the many\ncars overheating on the hard shoulder\noccasionally sending clouds of smoke\nover the buses.\nBy the time we escaped the M6 it\nwas around the time we had expected\nto be home and we were only as far as\nManchester. Stopping at a petrol station with an attached Chinese to regroup seemed to be the best plan, even\nthough their toilet facilities had clearly\nbeen used by everyone else who had\nescaped the M6 that night too\u2026 It was\n2am by the time we got back to London\nandtheminibusdriversnoblydrovethe\nmajority of the fellwanderers home to\nbed. The whole trip had lasted an impressive 56 hours and most of us would\nagree that whilst it was a significantly\nmore eventful fellwanderers excursion\nthan the average perhaps not all of the\nexcitement ought to be repeated!\nIf you would like to join the adventure\nor find out more we meet for lunch\non Tuesday\u2019s in dB\u2019s from 12:30.

There\nare a lot of things you can do to reduce\nyour chances of being a victim of crime,\nboth on and off campus. These include\nprotecting your property against theft,\nstaying safe when drinking and staying\nsafe on the streets. The following advice\nhas been taken from governmental\nwebsites- for more details please visit\nwww.crimereduction.homeoffice.gov.uk\nImmobilise- protecting your\nproperty\nImmobilise is the UK National Property\nRegister, and should be a first stop\nfor all students. The idea is that you\nregister your property such as laptops,\nphones and MP3 players using their\nserial number on your personal portfolio\nwhich is completely free. If it is then\nlost or stolen, you use Immobilise to tell\nlaw enforcement, your insurer, and the\nsecond-hand trade to assist in recovering\nyour property and catch the thief.\nImmobilise is the world\u2019s largest FREE\nregister of possession ownership details\nand with its sister site CheckMEND\n(www.checkmend.com ) the largest\ndatabase of stolen property and blocked\nmobile phones. This online checking\nservice is used by all the UK Police\nforces to trace owners of lost and\nstolen property. In addition Immobilise\nis checked daily by a huge range of\nrecovery agencies and lost property\noffices including the Transport For\nLondon Lost Property Office.\nAs a direct result of Immobilise there are\nover 250 cases a week where property\nis returned or information collected that\nassists the Police in investigating criminal\nactivity involving stolen goods.\nVisit www.immobilise.com for details.\nBike theft\nWith an the ever-increasing popularity\nof cycling, the South Kensington\ncampus has seen a weekly increase\nin the number of bikes parked on site.\nUnfortunately we still see a number\nof thefts from the campus. The bikes\nthat have been stolen are often those\nthat haven\u2019t been locked up, ones with\ninsufficient bike locks and those parked\nin insecure areas.\nWhen you purchase your bike:\n\u2022 Take out insurance, either by extending\nyour home contents insurance or\nthrough a separate policy. Cycling\norganisations and bike shops may offer\nspecialist cover.\n\u2022Register your bicycle model, make and\nframe number. This assists the police\nin returning recovered bikes to their\nrightful owners.\n\u2022 Take a clear, colour photograph of\nyour bike and make a written record\nof its description, including any unique\nfeatures, so that you can report it\naccurately if stolen.\n\u2022 Security mark the bicycle.\nWhen locking up your bike, try to take\nthe following into account:\n\u2022 Always lock your bicycle, even if you\nare just leaving it for a couple of minutes.\n\u2022 Lock your bike to an immovable object.\nUse a proper bike rack/ground anchor.\nRemember that thieves can remove\ndrainpipes and lift bikes off signposts.\n\u2022 Lock your bike through the frame.\n\u2022 Secure removable parts. Lock both\nwheels and the frame together. Take\nwith you smaller parts and accessories\nthat can be removed without tools, for\nexample lights, pumps, computers,\npanniers and quick-release saddles, or\nfit security fasteners on items such as\nwheels, headsets and seat posts.\n\u2022 Make the lock (and chain, if used) and\nbike hard to manoeuvre when parked\n\u2013 to stop thieves smashing the lock\nopen.\nCabwise\n\u2022 Always use a licensed minicab, taxi,\nnightbus or the Tube to get home-never get into a minicab on the street\nthat you haven\u2019t booked.\n\u2022 Text HOME to 60835 to get the\nnumber of one taxi and two licensed\nminicab firms, in the area you are\ntexting from, sent directly to your\nphone. Texts are charged at 35p per\nmessage plus your standard message\nrate.\n\u2022 Never leave the lock lying on\nthe pavement \u2013 a lock can be\nsledgehammered easily when it\u2019s\nresting on the ground.\n\u2022 Locks can also be picked, so face\nthe lock towards the ground (but not\nresting on it) so it can\u2019t easily be turned\nupwards for picking.\nThere are many different locks on the\nmarket and price is not necessarily a\nreliable indicator of quality. The most\nimportant factor is how long the product\ncan resist attack.\n\u2022 You should look for products that have\nbeen tested against attack. Check out\nwww.soldsecure.com for certified\nlocks, or ask your local bike shop for a\nrecommendation.\n\u2022 Invest in a quality lock. Hardened steel\nD-shaped locks are recommended\nas the minimum standard. It is worth\nspending proportionately more on a\nlock for a more expensive bike.\nDrink spiking\nDrink spiking is when mind-altering\nsubstances, such as drugs or alcohol\nhave been added to your drink without\nyou knowing. Sadly, this is increasingly\ncommon in the UK, with the most\ncommon motive being the intention to\ncarry out sexual assault, rape or theft.\n11% of drink spiking victims are male.\nThe most common drugs used are GHB,\nrohypnol and ketamine. These drugs\nact as an anaesthetic when mixed with\nalcohol, reducing a person\u2019s ability to\nresist sexual assault or robbery. They are\nusually tasteless, odourless, and have\nno colour. Therefore, it is hard to tell if\nyour drink has been spiked by tasting,\nsmelling, or looking at it.\nIf your drink has been spiked with\nGHB, rohypnol, or ketamine, symptoms\nnormally come on within 5 to 20\nminutes, and can last as long as 12\nhours. However, your symptoms can\nvary depending on what drug has been\nused. Common symptoms include:\n\u2022 dizziness and difficulty with walking,\n\u2022 confusion or feeling of disorientation,\nespecially the next day,\n\u2022 nausea or vomiting,\n\u2022 hallucinations,\n\u2022 tiredness and fatigue,\n\u2022 difficulty speaking, or slurred speech,\n\u2022 visual problems, blurred vision,\n\u2022 paranoia\n\u2022 memory loss\nIf you begin to feel really drunk after a\nsmall amount of alcohol, or you think\nthat your drink has been spiked with\ndrugs, get help from a friend, relative,\nor a senior member of management in\nthe club or pub you are in. Tell someone\nyou trust immediately. Get to a place of\nsafety as soon as possible, and only go\nhome with someone who you totally\ntrust. If you are with people you do not\nknow, contact a trusted friend or relative\nand ask them to pick you up and look\nafter you.\nIf you are experiencing symptoms such\nas drowsiness, vomiting or hallucinations,\ngo to an Accident and Emergency (A&E)\ndepartment immediately. Tell the medical\nstaff there that you believe your drink\nwas spiked, and they will contact the\npolice for you as drink spiking is illegal.\nThe police may ask to take a blood or\nurine sample from you so that it can be\ntested for any unusual substances.\nMost drugs leave your body within 12-72\nhours, so it is important you are tested\nas soon as possible if you think your\ndrink has been spiked.\nIf your drink has been spiked, it is\nunlikely you will be able to see, taste or\nsmell any difference, so it is important\nthat you try to prevent it from happening.\nFollow these guidelines to lower the risk\nof your drink being spiked:\n\u2022 keep your drink in your hand, and hold\nyour thumb over the opening if you are\ndrinking from a bottle,\n\u2022 keep an eye on your friends\u2019 drinks,\n\u2022 do not leave your drink unattended at\nany time, even while in the toilet,\n\u2022 never accept a drink from anyone you\ndo not know or trust,\n\u2022 if you go on a date with someone you\ndo not know, tell a friend or relative\nwhere you will be and what time you\nwill be back, and\n\u2022 try to drink from a bottle rather than\na glass when possible, as it is more\ndifficult to spike a drink in a bottle.\nPersonal Safety\nSelf-defence and safety awareness\nclasses may help you feel more secure.\nThere are some student societies that\noffer this such as the Filipino Martial\nArts Society and other organisation.

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCaz Knight\nArts Editor\nM\nonday the second of\nFebruary dawned,\nyielding snow, fewer\ncars and eerily lacking ubiquitous red\ndouble-deckers which left the city with\na somewhat post-apocalyptic feel \u2013 albeit a calm, peaceful, pretty one.\nIt was the same morning on which\nthe press view for the Tate Britain\u2019s\nTriennial exhibition, Altermodern, was\nheld \u2013 the white, blank canvas of London symbolising perfectly the opportunity for a new wave of contemporary\nart which the exhibition is celebrating\nand exploring.\nThe curator, Nicolas Bourriaud, has\nspent the last two years painstakingly\ninterviewing artists and visiting their\nstudios in search of this new breed of\nart which is springing up as post-mod-ernism recedes. Rosie Milton will review the Tate Triennial exhibition here\nnext week.\nTrajectories, as opposed to destina-tions, are a unifying theme in the exhibition and one which is beginning\nto spring up in other exhibitions, too.\nIndian Highway at the Serpentine Gallery explores this theme of travel and\ndisplacement in India.\nAlthough only dealt with in terms\nof India, the ideas put across sum up\nthe globalisation occurring throughout the world and all the travelling that\ntakes place as a result of this. Theme\naside, this exhibition is a must-see on\naccount of the sheer beauty and originality of the works contained in such a\nsmall space. Highly recommended for\nanyone seeking an exotic and exciting\nalternative to concrete and rain. The\nSerpentine is five minutes from Imperial, in Kensington Gardens, and is free\nto boot.\nBut for this week, Arts has some\nreviews that will banish the winter\nblues for when the snow disappears.\nWe have a distinctly vernal theme this\nweek with a book review set in a hot\nsummer in Brooklyn and a theatre review by Emilie Beauchamp of one of\nShakespeare\u2019s best loved comedies, A\nMidsummer Night\u2019s Dream.\nIn addition to this we have a preview\nof the Sadler\u2019s Wells production, Eonnagata, where we sent Jessica Bland to\nreport back and enlighten us on contemporary dance in London \u2013 watch\nout for next week\u2019s review of Canadian\ndance troupe\u2019s show, Traces, too.\nThank you once more for the huge\namount of enthusiasm we have received to cover all manner of shows and\nexhibitions. Keep it coming: culture (in\nmoderation if exams are looming) is a\nbrilliant alternative to studying.\nEmail us at arts.felix@imperial.\nac.uk for requests and to send us your\nreviews.\nA white blank\npage\nLove, fun and frolics in the Forest\nEmilie Beauchamp resists winter\u2019s chill with a succesful modern adaption of Shakespeare\u2019s MSND\nF\nor the past three years, the\nNovello Theatre has hosted\nthe Royal Shakespeare Company for its winter program,\nrevisiting the classics of this\nproclaimed playwright. As the first\nplay (to be followed shortly by The\nTaming of the Shrew), the RSC presents\nA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream in all its\nflamboyant comedy and ridiculous-ness, marvellously played by the whole\ncast.\nWhilst Shakespeare\u2019s plays have\nproven over and over again to be time-less, almost eternal, it is always a relief\nto see such a play enshrined in a contemporary setting without the loss of\nthe traditional touches of Shakespeare\u2019s\ntime, language included. In fact, many\nhave tried to reinvent and reintegrate\nShakespeare into the modern world because of the everlasting topics his plays\naddress but few have really succeeded\nin creating effectively something with\nthe proper effect. On most accounts,\nGregory Doran\u2019s A Midsummer Night\u2019s\nDream can be counted within these\nfew. Accents suitable to Shakespeare\u2019s\ntime are used and all verses are kept\nin, matched with good intonation and\npronunciation for those unused to\nthe old style of English. The magic of\nthe woods at the border of a modern\nAthens is perfectly presented in a setting of light bulb-lit nocturnal skies\nand elevating moon crescents, with a\nlarge mirror at the back reflecting all\nthe actors and spectators creating the\nillusion the entire forest is alive but\nalso working as a witness to the play\u2019s\nmoral and emotional symmetry. The\ncostumes are just as well-designed,\nthe Athenians dressed in smart business suits and cocktail dresses whilst\nthe fairies parade a mix of punky-trash\nensembles, along with voodoo-esque\npuppet-mimics of themselves. All of\nthis confers true personalities to each\nof the characters as soon as they step\non the scene and astonishingly everything is very well performed throughout the long tirades of the play and\neven includes some accompanying\nsongs and dances.\nThis can easily be explained by the\nall-star cast performing; from Peter de\nJersey\u2019s powerful and God-like Oberon\nto Andrea Harris\u2019 passionate Titania,\nwithout forgetting Shakespeare-learnt\nEdward Bennett playing a sincere\nDemetrius, it was set to be a stellar\nevening.\nWith a range of discussion including Indian babies, love, friendship,\ndrama, treachery and a crew of at\nleast 20 actors, A Midsummer Night\u2019s\nDream could sound like a confusing\nBollywood love story, but after the\nfirst scenes direction is established and\nmaintained until the last minute of the\nshow... three hours later! If the play\nis a delight and enchantment for the\nfirst two hours, one wonders why risk\nto overstretch its success by enduring\neven more languishing Hermia or ridiculous Bottom who makes us laugh\nso much. The last scene is still very\namusing, but one notices more easily\nthe continuous physical representation of all the wordy imageries of the\ntext; the \u201cmoon\u201d is accompanied by all\nstaring at the sky, reference to \u201clove\u201d is\nnever pronounced without all six lovers looking automatically lost in each\nother\u2019s eyes... Great acting or overem-phasised emotional depth? In the end,\none could have skimmed off these extra theatrical moments, though none\nof them really affect the overall result\nof the play.\nRevisiting such a classic is definitely\nwarming up the ghastly winter and one\nwould wish the fairies\u2019 touch to linger\nin your mind for a little longer. If it\ncan be afforded, A Midsummer Night\u2019s\nDream is definitely one of London\u2019s\nmust-sees of this year so far.\nOn at the Novello Theatre until\n7th February Andrea Harris (Titania) and Peter de Jersey (Oberon)\nHe loves me, he loves\nme not. He loves me!\nW\nriter. Mother. Musician. Lover. Fighter. Thinker. Poet.\nGemma Weekes\nappears as all this\nand more after reading her first novel,\nLove Me, published this month. Do not\nlet the fact that a bright, young, female\nmusician/poet \u2018transitioning\u2019 into\nwriting prose (especially that concerning love and romance) fool you into\nthinking this will be anything short of\nbeautiful; anything other than potent,\nfor this is anything but chick lit.\nChick lit, the romance novel, trash\n(call it what you will) has received a bad\nname and for good reason, too. Bridget\nJones\u2019 Diary spurred on a generation\nof literary works continually rehashing the same old theme of disappointing men, remorse at overindulgence\nand the woes of one\u2019s dreary career. It\nwould be a pity if Love Me were to be\nassociated with this brand of fiction.\nThe subject of love is indeed where\nthe roots of this story lie but is also\nthe fuel which sets ablaze a gripping\nstory that pulls you into the grey drab\nof London then flings you into a sticky,\nhot summer in Brooklyn whilst occasionally shuttling you to-and-from St\nLucia, as you live through protagonist\nEden\u2019s obsessions, pains and catharsis as she battles an ongoing infatuation with first love, Zed, and comes to\nterms with horrors from that first summer with Zed.\nWeekes magics up every sight, sound,\nsmell, touch and even taste in her own\nunique way \u2013 descriptions which consist of only a few words yet manage to\necho much louder.\nShe has the true nature of a poet and\nbreaks apart conventional ways of using words: sounds waft, light is loud,\nhumid nights overflow. Love is like a\ndrug, with Eden being drawn in \u201clike\na crack dealer attracts stinking, wild\neyed cats.\u201d The author\u2019s refusal to \u2018sugar-coat\u2019 love and put romance in comfortable terms, for example her disregard of the expected similes, puts this\nGemma Weekes harkens back to first loves in her first novel,\nLove Me, reviewed here by Caz Knight\nbook in its own category of novel.\nBlown apart are black stereotypes\nwith characters such as the tee-total,\nbrooding, guitar-thrashing Spanish\nwho abstains from herb yet takes magic mushrooms to break apart the walls\nof reality. Then there is Eden herself,\nlocked into adulthood yet harbouring\nall the hallmarks of teenage awkward-ness. Through her narrative Weekes\noffers insights into the constraints\nimposed on black musicians being expected to conform to a narrow range\nof music and also alludes to love\u2019s dark,\nmacabre side.\nThe novel is pure sensory escapism\nand a sure fire way to ban these winter\nblues with much to please both sexes.\nYou make me feel like dancing...\nJessica Bland gives us a beginner\u2019s introduction to contemporary dance: a fresher, funkier and distinctly\ncheaper alternative to your average play or exhibition.\n\u201cR\night foot. Left foot.\nWiggle a bit. Right\nfoot... Wobble.\nWhoops. Step behind \u2013 style it out.\nAnd left foot. Just keep nodding. It\u2019s\nOK if you just keep nodding, that way\nyou\u2019re still dancing, still on the beat,\nstill in the groove.\u201d\nExcept that you\u2019re not really dancing.\nYou\u2019re lolling round a dark room on a\nFriday night, limbs slightly less under\nyour control than normal. And whatever it might be that led you to be there\n(booze, lust, caffeine pills...), it\u2019s making you perform the kind of body jolts\nthat stretch the definition of \u201cdance\u201d\nabout as far as it will go.\nBut it\u2019s this form of dancing that many\nof us participate in most regularly.\nWhether on the dancefloor of one of\nLondon\u2019s array of night-time establish-ments, or at home on a computer game\ndancemat, the bopping-head-whilst-shuffling-from-one-foot-to-the-other\nis the most complex dance move we do\nor see. So perhaps this kind of movement isn\u2019t stretching the definition of\n\u201cdance\u201d at all \u2013 maybe it\u2019s exactly what\nwe mean by dancing?\nI hope not. Dance is a lot more besides;\nit\u2019s traditional, social dances like ballroom or flamenco. It\u2019s a storytelling\nartform like ballet or kathak. Each of\nthese genres has its own technique,\ncommunity and often also a wider cultural familiarity. However, there is one\nkind of dance amongst these that is\nequally well-defined and equally well-supported, but when asked to define it\nmost people draw a blank; this is contemporary dance.\nContemporary dance is not the same\nas modern dance. Modern (and certain types of jazz) dance are what you\nmight expect to see on-stage in musical theatre. Nor is it the same as hip\nhop, breaking or ballet. Contemporary\ndance traces its roots back to the US\nin the early Twentieth Century, when\nchoreographers started to move away\nfrom the constraints of traditional\nballet.\nAt about the same time, movements\nsuch as expressionism and cubism\ntook art further away from its classical routes. Indeed, the development\nof modern art is a pretty good parallel\nfor the way that contemporary dance\nevolved. In much the same way as artists tried to break free from technical\nand conceptual constraints and ended\nup developing their own techniques\nand conceptual frameworks, contemporary dance\u2019s struggle has resulted in\nseveral techniques and philosophies of\nits own.\nThese techniques form the backbone\nof what is now a burgeoning international scene. In London we have The\nPlace (home to London Contemporary Dance School) which was established in the 1960s and has been a\nbeacon of contemporary dance in Europe ever since. Even the Royal Opera\nHouse stages occasional contemporary\nperformance.\nThis then begs the question: why have\nmost of us never heard of contemporary dance? And to this there is no\nclear answer. You could argue that the\nscene built around it is inward looking and doesn\u2019t make enough effort to\nreach beyond its current participants:\nbeyond trained dancers and loyal au-diences. You could also argue that\ncontemporary dance is akin not to\nmodern art in general but only to its\nvery abstract parts, and so we should\nnot expect it to be any more widely\nknown about than the runners-up in\nthe Turner Prize.\nBut, whatever the answer, there are\nseveral good reasons to get to know a\nbit more about it right now.\nThe first is that there are several shows\nSome impressive feats from French-Canadian dance troupe the 7 Fingers. Their sell-out production Traces is reviewed here next week\non at the moment that manage to combine the artier end on dance with things\nlike circus, breaking, and thumping\nsound systems: making going to see\nthem less like two hours of Rothko and\nmore like an episode of Skins.\nThe second is that dance performances\nare generally cheaper (and often short-er) than mainstream theatre. Whereas\nthe average theatre ticket in London is\nnow \u00a330 or more, you can often find\ndance tickets for \u00a310 or even \u00a35.\nSo what, you might say, it\u2019s still not\nFabric on a Friday night.\nWell, you\u2019d be wrong. One dance work\nis to become part of exactly that Friday night experience. A multimedia\ndance installation that contorts the\nmovements of passerbys will be set up\noutside Fabric on selected nights over\nthe coming months. City of Abstracts\nis much like a high-tech fairground\nhouse of mirrors: creating movement\non a screen by distorting the movements of anyone standing in front of it\n\u2013 much more fun than the warm can of\nbeer that Fabric queuers normally have\nas their amusement.\nThis installation is part of a new season\nof offsite dance events commissioned\nby Sadler\u2019s Wells Theatre. Another\nhighlight of which is Hofesh Shecter\u2019s\ngig at The Roundhouse. Award-winning choreographer Hofesh produces\npolitical and gritty works that are always accompanied by very cool music,\nmost of which he writes himself. On the\n27th and 28th February, he is putting\nthis music in the limelight when he\nputs on the first ever contemporary\ndance gigs. 20 musicians and 17 dancers will take over the main space at The\nRoundhouse to present a reworking of\ntwo of his current works.\nAway from their new, slightly left-field,\noffsite programme, the Sadler\u2019s Wells\nretains its reputation for accessible\ndance, making it a good place to start\nif you are thinking about dipping your\ntoe into the dance world. They often\nhave cheap ticket offers and also host\nevents like the annual hip-hop dance\nfestival Breakin\u2019 Convention. And their\nWest End venue, The Peacock Theatre,\nis currently showing the hugely successful Traces, which combines acro-batics, film and music to create a whole\nnew brand of circus.\nThey are also host to one of the most\nwidely awaited premieres this season.\nOpening on the 26th February, Eonnogatta is a new collaboration between\nSylvie Guillem, Russell Maliphant and\nRobert Lepage. Created and performed\nby all three, this piece draws on the\nJapanese art of Kabuki to tell the story\nof the 18th Century French spy Charles\nde Beaumont. What makes it so special is that each artist involved is at the\ntop of their game: Sylvie as a dancer;\nRussell as a choreographer; Lepage as\na director. It\u2019s a bit like \u2018fantasy league\ntheatre company\u2019 has come to life. And\nwhen you add costumes by Alexander\nMcQueen to the team, I can\u2019t help but\nget a bit over-excited.\nDance, whether it\u2019s straight-up con-temporary, an installation piece or fla-menco, is not just bopping your head\nwhilst shuffling from one foot to the\nother \u2013 we all know that. It can also be\na cheaper, edgier and more entertaining alternative to theatre or art. So if\nyou are looking for a credit-crunch\nsized, skinny-jeans friendly arts fix,\nthen I can\u2019t think of anything better to\nrecommend.\nFurther information:\nwww.sadlerswells.com (video\npreviews as well as show\nbookings)\nwww.theplace.org (for performances and great adult dance\nclasses)\nwww.danceumbrellla.co.uk (an-nual autumn dance festival)\nAction from Sadler\u2019s Wells: Award-winning choreographer Jasmin Vardimon\u2019s Yesterday\n\n"

This\nversion of events was published it in\nScience back in 1998 by Paul Hoffman from Harvard University and\nAlan Kaufman from the University of\nMaryland in College Park, who. This\nevent that lasted over 10,000 years\nwould have resulted in extinction of\nmany living organisms, most of which\nwere microbes in those days. Hoffman\nand Kaufman suggested the planet defrosted thanks to the volcanic activity,\nwhich returned much of the carbon\nIs global cooling causing another Ice Age?\nThe Snowball Earth hypothesis\ndioxide back to the atmosphere allowing for global warming.\nA more recent paper suggests a\ndifferent scenario. A huge release of\nmethane, a potent greenhouse gas,\nmay have triggered quick melting of\nthe last snowball Earth, a study published in Nature in May 2008 suggest.\nAccording to the lead author Martin\nKennedy, a geologist at the University of California, Riverside, a similar\nabrupt temperature spike could occur\ntoday if abundant methane deposits in\nthe Arctic permafrost and the continental margins of the oceans are suddenly released.\n\u201cI would suggest that this particular\ntype of feedback is one scenario that\nwe could be looking at in the future.\u201d\nKennedy told National Geographic\nNews.\nSnowball Earth hypothesis is still\nsomewhat controversial with scientists coming up with evidence both for\nand against it. So for example,\nYonggang Liu and John Crowley,\nfrom Harvard, University co-authored\nthe paper, published in Nature in 2000\nthat, for the first time, demonstrated\nthat while huge deep glaciations did\nexist, a large amount of water near the\nequator was left unfrozen.\nAt the time, adherents to the \u201csnowball Earth\u201d theory coined the term\n\u201cslushball Earth\u201d to describe Peltier\u2019s\nfindings.\nAlso, in 2002 BBC said that \u201cSnowball Earth theory melted\u201d reporting\nabout a paper published in journal\n\u201cGlobal warming? Looks more like\nglobal cooling to me...\u201d Now how\nmany times have you heard this one\nbefore? I certainly heard it a few times\nthis winter, especilly while I was in\nCanada for winter vacations.\nIn fact, back in 1974, Time magazine\npublished an article \u201cAnother ice-age?\u201d\nin which it raised concerns about the\nglobal cooling trend observed in temperatures and the negative effects it\nwould have on people and our civili-zation. It said \u201cWhatever the cause of\nthe cooling trend, its effects could be\nextremely serious, if not catastrophic.\nScientists figure that only a 1% decrease in the amount of sunlight hitting the earth\u2019s surface could tip the\nclimatic balance, and cool the planet\nenough to send it sliding down the\nGeology that found some evidence inconsistent with the theory.\nBut just this January another study\nin Science found one of the predictions of the Snowball Earth confirmed.\nroad to another ice age within only a\nfew hundred years.\u201d And it did mention some causes of the global cooling as well, one of them being human\nactivity: \u201cMan, too, may be somewhat\nresponsible for the cooling trend.\nThe University of Wisconsin\u2019s Reid\nA. Bryson and other climatologists\nsuggest that dust and other particles\nreleased into the atmosphere as a result of farming and fuel burning may\nbe blocking more and more sunlight\nfrom reaching and heating the surface\nof the earth.\u201d\nIn 1975, NewsWeek magazine published a controversial article about\nhow we\u2019re headed towards another ice\nag, with global cooling taking place.\nIn 2006 Newsweek published another\narticle, a web exclusive (something that\ndidn\u2019t exist back in 1975) remembering\nits original global cooling feature, this\ntime saying \u201cThe point to remember...\nis that predictions of global cooling\nnever approached the kind of widespread scientific consensus that supports the greenhouse effect today.\u201d and\nending jokingly \u201cAl in all, it\u2019s probably\njust as well that society elected not to\nfollow one of the possible solutions\nmentioned in the NEWSWEEK article:\nto pour soot over the Arctic ice cap, to\nhelp it melt.\u201d [!!]\nIt is quite ironic then that now we are\ntrying to escape the global warming,\nthis time definitely taking place and\ndefinitely caused by us.\nAnd global cooling isn\u2019t something\nto worry about anymore, it\u2019s in fact\na \u2018catch-all\u2019 phrase for various ways\nwe could intervene further with the\nclimate to try and reverse the global\nwarming.\nWired magazine reported just last\nweek that \u201cMany global cooling approaches have been floated. The broad\nrange of the proposals \u2014 from injecting the upper atmosphere with sun-blocking particles to creating plankton\nblooms by feeding them extra iron to\nburying carbon-filled \u201cbiochar\u201d in soil\n\u2014 has made comparing them very difficult.\u201d and that a new study published\nin the journal Atmospheric Chemistry\nand Physics by earth scientists Tim\nLenton and Naomi Vaughan of East\nAnglia University in England found\n\u201cBy 2050, only stratospheric aerosol\ninjections or sunshades in space have\nthe potential to cool the climate back\ntoward its pre-industrial state.\u201d\nSo perhaps we should just enjoy this\nlocalcoolingandallthesnowitbrought\nto us this week and keep in mind that\nglobal warming is the real bad guy to\npursue these days.\nMico Tatalovic\nScience Editor\nMico Tatalovic\nWas Earth once entirely under snow and ice?\nLarge parts of Europe and North America were covered by ice\nduring the last ice age, some 12,000 years ago.\nIf Snowball Earth ever existed, we certainly got the feel of what it might have\nbeen like earlier this week.\nPerhaps a good way of comparing\nto what Snowball Earth looked like\nwould be looking at Saturn\u2019s frozen\nmoon Enceladus. It is an inner most\nSaturn\u2019s moon with atmosphere, frozen ocean and average temperature of\n-200 degree Celsius.\n1975 NewsWeek article about global cooling.\nEight inches of snow caused London\nto come grinding to a halt on Monday.\nPens and keyboards were discarded as\npeople picked up snowballs for an epic\nbattle on Queen\u2019s lawn. Mayor Boris\nJohnson quipped \u201cWell, it was the\nright kind of snow... in the wrong kind\nof quantities\u201d.\nSo why did we have the worst snow\nfor 18 years? There are several effects\nwhich contributed.\nFirstly the jet stream was further\nSouth than usual, because of a large\narea of high pressure over Northern\nEurope (see pressure map). This same\nhigh pressure system allowed cold\nwind from the east to blow across the\nUK, as winds like to follow lines of\nconstant pressure. These cold dense\nwinds from northern Europe met the\nair warmed by the Atlantic, cooling it\nand as the air cooled water vapor condensed and fell as snow.\nPredicting the movements of these\nareas of high pressure is notoriously\ndifficult. Sometimes they can be\nstationary for weeks and are termed\n\u2018blocking highs\u2019.\nSimilar conditions normally cause\nsnow to falls on Scotland, as the jet\nstream is usually further north. The\nsame high pressure system over northern Europe would then cause chilly,\nbut dry conditions.\n\u201cThe year it reminds me of most at\npresent was 1962/1963. There we had\nthe same pattern of a lot of the winter\nwith the wind coming off the conti-nent, instead of off the Atlantic and so\nit was colder. But in 1962/1963 it was\na lot colder than this year so perhaps\nthat is telling us something.\u201d Brian\nHoskins, Director of the Grantham\nInstitute for Climate Change.\nThe movements of the jet stream\nare often to blame for unusual weath-er. The flooding last summer can be\nlinked to the jet stream moving south.\n\u201cOn longer timescales there is some\nevidence that climate change is tending to force the average latitude of\nthe jet stream, and thus the Atlantic\nstorm tracks, slightly further north resulting in warmer and wetter winters\nin N. Europe and drier conditions in\nsouthern Europe. The current situa-tion, however, just shows how hugely\nvariable the climate is!\u201d says Jo Haigh,\nProfessor of Atmospheric Physics\u201d\nThe jet stream flows about 10km\nabove the earth, between the troposphere and stratosphere. It forms at\nthe boundary between the cold polar\nair to the north and the warm subtropical air to the south. In the scarce\nOn Monday why did we have the worst (best!)\nsnow for 18 years?\nChimpanzee (and media) politics\nTwo new studies published this week\nclaimed to shed light on our understanding of chimpanzee social lives.\nThe first, a 10 year study (published in\nthe American Journal of Primatology)\nat Gombe National Park, Tanzania,\nfound that smaller male chimps rely on\nbuilding coalitions to rise to the top of\nhierarchies. The researchers, from the\nJane Goodall Institute at the University\nof Minnesota, followed three different\nalpha males from 1992 to 2001 and recorded the amount of social behaviour\nshown by each.\nFrodo, the largest male at 51kg, relied almost entirely on physical aggression and rarely returned grooming favours; Wilkie, a relative weed\nat just 37kg, had to work on gaining\nbroad support by obsessively grooming everyone, male and female; and\nFreud (44kg) used a combination of\nthe two strategies.\nWhile chimps have been known to\nbe political animals for a long time\n(Frans de Waal\u2019s 1982 book \u2018Chimpanzee Politics\u2019 catalogued the power\nstruggles, scheming and backstabbing\nin a group of zoo chimps) this is one\nof the first wild studies to find such a\nclear link between body size and social behaviour. While it is tempting\nto draw parallels between their behaviour and our own \u2013 talk of Machiavellian apes and dumb brutes and\ncomparisons to various world leaders\nbeing all too common in the popular\npress \u2013 the authors caution against\nsuch lazy generalisations. Indeed,\none of the prime difficulties with wild\nape studies is their woeful replication\ncount (can you really take anything\nwith confidence from a sample size of\nthree?).\nThe second chimp story of the week\nwas right up the Daily Mail\u2019s street. A\nUniversity of Portsmouth psycholo-gist, Prof Kim Bard, worked with 46\norphaned or neglected chimp infants\nat the Yerkes National Primate Research Centre in Atlanta. Her findings\nare interesting on two counts. First,\nyoung chimps are better adjusted\nwhen raised with \u2018responsive care\u2019,\npsychobabble for a mother\u2019s touch.\nIn Prof Bard\u2019s words, they were \u201cless\neasily stressed, less often attached to\n\u2018comfort blankets\u2019, had healthier relationships with their caregivers and\nwere less likely to develop stereotypic\nrocking.\u201d\nCue much talk of the importance of\nfamily, broken Britain, etc. in the tab-loids. Second, her results appeared to\nshow that young chimps outperform\nhuman babies in cognitive tests up to\naround 9 months. We will no doubt\nsee headlines bemoaning the current\nstate of schooling in our broken soci-ety, and how young babies are allowed\naccess to knives and drugs at far too\nearly an age.\nThe fact of the matter is, neither of\nthese studies is particularly ground-breaking. Desmond Morris was talking about human \u201cgrooming talking\n\u2013 the meaningless, polite chatter of\nsocial occasions\u201d back in the 1960s,\nand it has been known for some time\nthat young chimps, as well as gorillas and orang-utans, are better at\nproblem-solving than young humans.\nThis is simply an evolutionary result\nof their (relatively) harsh environment\nof upbringing.\nWhat is most dismaying is the predictable reaction of the media, to latch\nFelix Whitton\nDaniel Burrows\natmosphere at that height, there is\nnot much to slow the winds, and they\nhave been measured at speeds of up to\n400mph.\nPlanes therefore obviously would\nlike to use the streams, to save both\ntime and fuel. However the edges\nof the streams are often very turbulent and can cause difficult to predict\n\u2018Clear Air Turbulence\u2019 (CAT). CAT\nis to blame for at least two airplane\nincidents. United Airlines Flight 826\ndropped 100 feet suddenly, but luckily\nmanaged to make an emergency landing with only one fatality.\nFood for thought, but on a happier note Carol Vorderman, the ex-Countdown maths supremo, claimed\nenough snow fell in Britain yesterday\nfor everyone in the country to make a\nquarter of a million snowballs each.\nMeteorology of this week\u2019s snow storm.\nNot chimpanzees at all, but clearly smart.

As the saying goes, a good team wins when they\nplay badly. This has certainly been true\nover the last few weeks but the ability\nof the team to put games to bed has\nbeen invaluable.\nLast week, the grudge match between IC and IC Medicals was timed\nperfectly before the big varsity day on\nFebruary 25th. A strong start by Imperial saw many goal chances pass by. A\nsuper run by BJ on his debut for the\n1st XI made a mockery of the medical\ndefences and a superb finish saw the\ncrowd go wild.IC \u2018Allez Voued\u2019 after\nthe Frenchman\u2019s goal, which was added to by a rebounded short corner by\nthe German, Koch. The medicals put\na brave fight and scored a wonderfully\nworked move in addition to a decent\nshort corner routine.\nThe Englishmen decided that we\ncould not depend on these foreigners\nanymore and Diana took advantage of\na penalty flick decision with Yogi Bear\nproviding the killer 4th goal blow. Final\nJack Cornish\nHockey\nrampage\nHockey men\u2019s 1sts continue their\ndominance in ULU and BUCS\nscore 4-2.\nAt the weekend the winning momentum continued on a cold and\nrather bleak day. Against a team who\nhave only won a couple of matches all\nseason, the game was over before it\nbegan.\nA couple of goals in quick succession\nconfirmed this! Although a couple of\ngoals were conceded during the blizzard that covered the pitch in a light\nlayer of snow, the game finished on a\nhigh with short corner routines and\nset pieces flowing well. Strong performances in the midfield by Krusty,\nDiana and Dennis proved invaluable\nduring the match with a the defence\nand attack dealing with their jobs well\nconsidering the conditions.

The\ngame started at 11 vs 10 and RSM\nwere quick to take control, with good\nruns from Christian and Danny the\ntwo wingers. It didn\u2019t take long for\nthe possession to take an effect when\ncaptain, Steve Meunier won a free\nkick out on the right hand side which\nwas delivered with deadly accuracy by\nMatt W for Steve to glance into the far\npost with only 5 minutes gone. It was\nat one nil that Imperials illusive 11th\nplayer turned up but he showed little\nurgency to get onto the pitch, spending\nanother 10 minutes on the sideline getting changed. This proved to be very\ncostly as the over confident IC continued to play with three at the back\nand they were punished again on the\ncounter attack when a great run from\nJohnny ended with a selfless lay off to\nMatt who calmly slotted home to make\nthe score 2.0. IC were now up to 11\nplayers, and they tried to break down\na solid defence with most of the possession coming down the left flank but\nusually ending with a dominant Ez at\nright back cleaning up constantly.\nOwen and Alex judged the wind perfectly and controlled any balls over the\ntop and RSM faithful Andy was solid\nas ever at the left back position. Hard\nas they tried IC could not get into the\nbox and had few shots of any kind, with\nkeeper Rowan having little to do but\nclear up over hit long balls. Half time\ncame with RSM deservedly 2:0 up.\nHalf time saw the replacement of an\ninjured Johnny with Jon and IC started\nin a fashion that summed up their per-formance, in kicking the ball into touch\nalmost straight from kick off. It was IC\nhowever who had a share of the possession and were able to claw one back\nwhen a player who appeared not to be\nfrom the 7\u2019s, but from a higher ranked\nteam, found himself unmarked from a\ncorner to nod home.\nWhere RSM teams of old may have\nfolded under the growing pressure,\ntoday it seemed to wake them up once\nagain and the reaction was almost instant with Jon firing into the side netting and then 5 minutes later, finding\nthe post. RSM had found another gear\nand with the exception of a couple of\ncorners, IC were unable to cause any\nmore problems. Subs Fabrizio and\nJames worked well down the right and\nMatt and Stu were controlling the middle of the park.\nThe game was put beyond doubt\nwhen Jon, who had come so close earlier on, chipped and rounded his man\nand then lobbed the advancing keeper\nwith 8 minutes to go. The game was\nseen out by a dominant RSM team who\ndeserved the three points and move up\na place as a result.\nThis was the perfect response to earlier criticism and also a great start to\nthe run into the bottle match, which\ntakes place at the end of February.\nFootball\nRSM Men\u2019s 1st XI 3\nImperial College 7th XI 2\n\n"

So much\nso that one of my friends went as far as\nto eat a piece of her most recent article\nin protest (it was her face).\nWhat is it about her that angers so\nmany of the men and women around\nme? Delving into her most recent article \u201cImperial Girl pays to look at-tractive, so dinner\u2019s on you\u201d, IG tries\nto justify her opinion that men should\npay for the first date because making\nyourself pretty is expensive. IG then\ngoes on to suggest that, for a woman to\npay for dinner is perhaps a little taboo.\nSeriously? The only part of that article\nthat I agreed with was her comment on\nbeing spoilt. Now at this point I think\nit is important to clarify that I am not\nobjecting outright to the idea the guy\nshould pick up the bill. That is between\nthe two of you and what the both of\nyou think. However the very idea that\nit is justified by the sheer cost of having to make yourself look pretty is\nquite frankly; childish. I am aware that\nwomen like to smear expensive beauty\nproducts onto their bodies in the hope\nit will make them feel prettier.\nIt is fair to say this is something that\nwill probably escape us man-animals\nfor a long time to come. But what little I have gathered from this ritual is\nthat it is not done for the benefit of the\nbill payer, it is for you \u2013 the woman.\nTo make you feel more secure, content in the idea that your \u2018worst bits\u2019\nare safely tucked away under layers of\npaint. Once more I feel the need to\npoint out this is also not an attack on\nwomen, as men have their own special\nblend of emotional crippling and social\nconditioning.\nIn fact many of the men I know do\nnot like their women caked in make\nup. We like the idea that when we wake\nup next to them the morning after they\nwill be as good as they were when we\ndecided to go to bed with them (beer\ngoggles not withstanding). This is not\nto say I like a woman poorly presented\nbut being clean, smelling clean, shaving and combing your hair cost very\nlittle. IG also doesn\u2019t seem to realise\nthat I do not wake up every day clean\nfaced. I too have to shave and while my\nhair style could politely be referred to\nas \u2018elegantly dishevelled\u2019 many men do\nspend a lot of time and money on their\nappearance. Not that I am claiming it\nis as much work for a bloke to fall into\nthat socially decided norm of what is\nacceptable. But that comes down to\ntime more then money and barring\nvarious analogies, they are generally\nnot the same (or over that long summer break we would all be very rich).\nUltimately all this comes down to appearances and preconceptions, a topic\nalready raised by IG and much more\nsuccessfully then any of her more recent articles.\nIG then goes on to suggest her favourite methods of running away when\nIndeh_fish\u2019s friend ate Imperial Girl\u2019s face. It was papery\nLetters\nI\ntake great issue with Jovan\nNedi\u0107\u2019s article \u2018What is the\npoint of the letter C?\u2019. Consider\nthe changes recommended.\nPresence will become presents\ngiving presents a third meaning (this\nwould alsohave to be split phonetically\ninto two words, one meaning the act\nof presenting and the other a synonym\nfor a gift).\nWith regards to the low literacy\nrates in the UK , the UN Developmental Programme estimates that the UK\nhas the same literacy rate as Ireland,\nSweden, Switzerland, France and Germany. On elaborate words, indeed\nthey can be abused but they have a\ndefinitive meaning. They are created\nto more precisely describe something.\nIndeed without \u2018elaborate\u2019 words, surely we will end up with Newspeak. As\nOrwell wrote in 1946, \u2018[language] becomes ugly and inaccurate because our\nthoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for\nus to have foolish thoughts.\u2019\nFor those who have learned English\nas a foreign language, the difficulties\nin its initial learning are not with spelling but instead with words, such as set\nand get, which have many meanings.\nPhonemics gets about 80% of spellings\nright so spelling is not really a great issue except with more elaborate words.\nEnglish is difficult to master but is\nthis a bad thing? One of the great facets of reading is that either we learn\nnew words and phrases or the writer\nexpresses a common feeling in a far\nmore appropriate way than we would\nbe able. Words such as get (which has\neighty entries under it in the Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary) have many meanings which a non native speaker must\nbecome accustomed. The fact that\nthen the meaning of a clause (such as\n\u2018get up\u2019) is also ambiguous (awake or\narise) adds more confusion.\nOn phoneticising itself, there are in\nthe English language (according to the\nOED) 27 consonant sounds, 24 vowel\nand diphthong sounds and about 25\nmore adopted from foreign languages.\nTo suggest phoneticising suggests a\nway to write at least 50 distinct letters.\nLet us assume that we do phoneticise\nthe language. By which convention?\nSuppose we adhere to Received Pronunciation. The Americans, Australians, South Africans, New Zealanders,\netc. might adopt their own spellings\n(the language is after all now phonet-ic). Many, especially the British, would\nargue that RP should be the standard\nphonetic spelling but the fact is that\nthere are now more English speakers\nin the US, India and Nigeria than the\nUK. Indeed we also encounter problems of dialect. If we just tell people\nto spell phonetically, Cheryl Cole will\nhave a completely different way of\nspelling almost every word from most\npeople. Indeed, spelling and grammar\nbecame fixed with the introduction of\nprinting because it became ridiculous\nto keep three or four spellings of each\nword. Now with not only dialects within countries but international varieties\nof English this problem will be exponentially greater. What would be worse\nis if we phoneticise and the rest of the\nworld does not. The English will write\ngibberish while the rest of the world\nwrites in English. When we read in our\nhead, we read in our own voices. Thus\nattempting to emulate the accent of the\nwriter or of the intended character to\nread a book would be a very difficult\ntask. Indeed, anyone who has tried\nreading Trainspotting can attest this.\nWithin language, lies the history of\nthose who speak and spake it. English\nis composed of 28% words of French\norigin, 25% Norse/Dutch origin and\n28% Latin origin. The rest includes\nwords of Greek origin, words without any particular etymology, proper\nname derivatives and others. Not only\nthis, but someone who speaks another\nlanguage can thus pick up parts of the\nEnglish language very quickly. This\nadvantage usually comes from reading\nthe language changing the spelling of\nwords will hide their etymology thus\nremoving this possible advantage.\nThe causes associated with the Serbian\nphoneticisation of Cyrillic do not apply\nhere ; there is no widespread illiteracy\nand there is already a standard convention for writing particular words. Fixing\nan unbroken problem is unnecessary\nand in this case probably quite foolish.\nViren Jeram\nthe bill comes. Is she five? This is what\nI really believe to be the problem, Imperial Girl is just that \u2013 a girl. While all\nthe women around me desperately try\nto distance themselves from the very\nbody IG claims to represent. IG continues to be childish, running around\nin her \u2018fuck-me pumps\u2019 and complaining men won\u2019t sleep with her. Combining this childish attitude with her idea\nthat being female and paying for dinner is taboo tends to generate certain\npreconceptions as to her standing in\nsociety, with many of those around me\ncoming to some conclusion that featured the word \u2018sloanie\u2019. So at the risk\nof looking like an idiot (a risk I often\ntake) I am going to say that being rich,\nor at least spoilt, has not done IG any\nfavours.\nSo if you\u2019re reading this, IG, and you\nplan to retort, then I welcome what\nyou have to say. But please remember\nI have no issues with women, make\nup, paying the bill or the rich. My only\ngripe is the increasingly childish way in\nwhich you present yourself; I actually\nfound your first article quite insight-ful. Also, if your retort constitutes an\narticle whereby you declare me an idiot\nbecause you say so and announce you\nwin.\nThen let me save you the time by\nsaying you win, if only to prevent you\nthe embarrassment of another A. Geek\nstyled incident.\n\u201cIG then goes on\nto suggest her\nfavourite methods\nof running away\nwhen the bill\ncomes. Is she five?\u201d\nYou\u2019ll find\nthere\u2019s more\nto LIFE\nat KPMG.\nQuite simply, things are bigger here. There\u2019s more of everything;\nmore development, more ambition, more international opportunities\nand a lot more work/life balance too.\nSo, whatever you want from LIFE, visit www.kpmg.co.uk/careers\nand find out when we\u2019re visiting your campus.\n\n"

Passionate Mexican emotion\nat it\u2019s best.\nThe Return (2003) \u2013 Breathtaking\nscenery. Probe the levels to uncover\na pure Russian psyche driving this fa-ther-son drama. Authentic.\nFour Shades of Brown (2004) \u2013 This\nepic saga depicts some of Sweden\u2019s\nquirkier individuals, wracks you from\nhilarity to speechlessness in seconds.\nWatch in two halves if you have to, but\na must-see.\nSo please stop printing crap. If I want\nsomeone to piss in my eyes, I\u2019ll hide in\nJabba the Hutt\u2019s toilet.\u201d Bad Taste\nI had two reasons to print the com-ment. Firstly, I liked the movies which\nBad Taste recommends and wanted\nto share that recommendation with\nour readers. Secondly, I really liked\nBad Taste\u2019s style of writing; he uses a\nplethora of adjectives (let\u2019s just hope\nhe knows the nice ones too), attempts\nto be funny and is absolutely clueless\nabout the hypocrisy that oozes out of\nhis piece. So now I\u2019m appealing publicly to Bad Taste \u2013 send a review in, write\nsomething that you believe is worth\nreading and (here comes the corny bit)\nbe the change that you want to see. The\nfact that you\u2019re a prick doesn\u2019t mean I\nwill not print your reviews.\nOn an end note, I have to laugh at\nhow educating it is to be on the receiving end of a scathing comment. I just\nmight give some slack to crappy film\ndirectors and producers from now on.\nConstructive\ncriticism?\nThe Shining\nSnowedinatahauntedhotelinwhich\nthe ghosts have made house-sitter Jack\nNicholson insane. You better grab an\naxe before he does and get chopping,\nor you will end up in the spooky photo\nof the dead that concludes this freaky\nchiller.\nSnowy moments include running\nthrough a huge hedge maze in the\nfreezing cold, trekking across hills to\nsave the family and someone being frozen to death. Any film that can make\nsnow seem ominous is guaranteed to\nmake you scared.\nSnowy Day rating: 5/5\nCool Runnings\nWill four Olympic athletic failures\nbe able to overcome adversity and triumph as the first-ever Jamaican bobsled team? I think most of us know the\nanswer to that question, but this film is\nstill worth a watch because it is a heartwarming classic.\nSnowy moments include sitting in an\nice-cream van to prepare for the cold,\nfinally arriving in Canada and feeling\nthe cold and the unavoidable fact that\nthis is about the winter Olympics.\nSnowy Day rating: 3/5\nEternal Sunshine Of The Spotless\nMind\nA couple break up but instead of\nmoving on, they both have their memories erased. This amazing romance/\ndrama makes the most of both Jim\nCarey and Kate Winslet and by the\nend if you aren\u2019t sobbing into your pil-low, then you have a heart made of ice.\nThis is a great film to watch, even if\nyou don\u2019t like chick flicks, as it is very\nunconventional.\nSnowy Moments include the main\ncharacters falling in love on a frozen lake and having a snow fight on a\nbeach.\nSnowy Day rating: 2/5\n30 Days Of Night\nJust as a small Alaskan town is preparing for a month without sunlight,\na pack of murderous vampires set up\ncamp and feast on everyone living\nthere. Only a small band of survivors\ncan try to fend off the vampires \u2013 but\nwill they survive the 30 days of night?\nA film for horror fans and those of you\nwho prefer dark (both literally and\nfiguratively) plots, this film delivers in\nboth shocks and suspense.\nSnowy Moments include people being slaughtered on the snow, blood\nsplattering the snow, a snowmobile\nchurning vampires onto the snow\u2026\nyou get the drift\u2026\nSnowy Day rating: 4/5\nGroundhog Day\nWhen weatherman Phil (Bill Murray)\ngets stuck in the same day, unable to escape the small town of Punxsutawney\nbecause of a blizzard that he predicted\nwouldn\u2019t be there, hilarity, as well as a\nfew life lessons, ensue. February 2nd\nwas Groundhog Day; so if you weren\u2019t\nsad enough like me to actually remember and watch it on the day, then make\nsure you see this as soon as you can,\nbecause it is an excellent film.\nSnowy moments include Phil stuck\nin a snowy traffic jam on a motor-way, having plenty of snowball fights,\nice-sculpting, and of course the beautiful snow-angel sculpture of Andie\nMacDowell.\nSnowy Day rating: 5/5\nDie Hard 2\nCan John McClane (Bruce Willis)\nbattle insane terrorists once again, this\ntime at an airport covered in snow,\nwho wish to crash aeroplanes filled\nwith innocent people unless their demands are met? Although this is not\nthe best Die Hard, it is still very good\nand includes lots of action scenes and\nwitty remarks from our hero. SPOILER\nWARNING: Do not watch this film if\nyou have a fear of aeroplane crashes! I\nhate to say it but us English don\u2019t make\nit (why couldn\u2019t they kill Americans \u2013\nwhy us??). Snowy Moments include\nJohn running across a snow-filled\nrunway, murdering someone with an\nincredibly large and sharp icicle, and\nnumerous snowstorms.\nSnowy Day rating: 4/5\nIron Will\nI had to have a Disney movie some-where, didn\u2019t I? But this feel-good tale\nabout overcoming the odds contains\nlots of snow, as it is about a young\nteenager who heroically joins a dogsled race to win money for his family.\nBased on a true story, those of you who\nlove feel-good films will enjoy this,\nespecially because it is hard to know\nif he will win the race or not. Kevin\nSpacey also makes an appearance as\na scene- stealing, morally-challenged\njournalist.\nSnowy Moments include\u2026 well, this\nis a film about a sled race in Canada.\nSnowy Day rating: 4/5\nSelected James Bond Films\nJames Bond is well known for his\nescapades around the globe and sometimes he comes across a rather perilous snowy situation that he has to ski\nout of. On Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service\nis probably the wintriest Bond film, as\nit is mostly set in a ski resort, but The\nWorld Is Not Enough, Die Another Day,\nA View To A Kill, For Your Eyes Only\nand The Spy Who Loved Me all have\nsnow-bound action scenes. I am sure\nothers do, but these films also happen\nto be great Bond films anyway.\nSnowy moments include: Bond skiing down a bobsleigh track, Bond being chased across a glacier by a beam of\nsunlight (yes, you read that correctly),\nBond being chased whilst skiing (this\nhappens a lot, and I mean a lot), and a\nsexy scene in an Arctic submarine.\nSnowy Day rating: 3/5\nKate Winslet as the \u2018Cookie Monster\u2019 enjoying subzero temperatures.\nMackenzie Astin races through\nCanada to save his family... sob...\nAnybody?

Unlike the\npredatory males who populated the two main dance floors, this\none just wanted to share my place in\nfront of the air conditioning. He put\nhis hands up to the cold air and sighed,\n\u201cAh, oh dear, the poor rotten Egg.\u201d Really? I thought, I can\u2019t smell anything.\nThen the penny dropped: \u201cWhat,\nso you don\u2019t think much of this place\nthen?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cits falling apart, and\nthe crowd are just not cool.\u201d\nLooking around at the slightly droopy\ntent-style ceiling and the sad looking dj\nplaying to the twelve people sitting on\ndirty white leather stools, and thinking\nback to the testosterone fuelled dance\nfloor, he definitely has a point.\nClubbing is much more fun when\nthere are nice toilets and clean floorss\nand when I can dance by myself and\nnot be bothered by anyone around\nme. But, unlike my new friend, I care\nmore about the music than the people\nand that night the music can only be\ndescribed as bangin\u2019.\nMuak did a great thing in getting\nNew York house legend Osunlade to\nplay in London. This man knows how\nto get people really dancing: no drops,\nno jump up beats, just damn good\nmusic.\nBy keeping the funk in house music,\nwhilst avoiding the dismal genre of\nfunky house, Osunlade is unlike any\nEuropean Dj I can think of.\nI\nt was another murky January afternoon; my coffee was\nwarm and my attention span\nshort. I took to the internet.\nLeft brain/right brain function-ing, transcendental meditation, bohemian counterculture - my absent mind\nwas dragged along through a chain of\nvaguely related themes as I clicked on-wards. Eventually I arrived at http://\nwww.one-tribe.info/, a multicoloured\npastiche of swirling colours, hippie\nideals and amusing animated butter-flies. On inspection it turned out that\nthe site was a hub for a multitude of\nLondon based parties and gatherings,\nwhere like-minded people could share\nfriendship and a collective concern\nfor the \u2018delicate planet and everything\nwithin it\u2019. This all appeared sincere and\nwell-intentioned, so with a spirit of inquisitiveness and mild adventure I decided to go to the next party.\nIt was 11pm on Saturday night and\nMUAK (People Together) HHH\n31st January\nEgg\nPrice: \u00a315 on door, \u00a312 conc\nCatherine Jones\nNightlife Editor\nSnow Bar!\nI\nguess I should start with some\nbad innuendo about white pow-der, as this is the nightlife sec-tion. Hahaha. Oh yes, of course\nI am talking in a sarcastic manner about snow blizzards, not cocaine.\nHahaha. We\u2019re not all rampant drug\ntakers here at the felix offices (I myself\nhave checked into rehab). I love snow,\nbut it certainly is not conjunctive with\nhaving an awesome night on the town.\nWhen the temperature drops below\nzero and the transport infrastructure is\ndown, clubbing is off the menu.\nAs ever, you should make the most of\nthe situation, Imperial students! Why\nnot drink cocktails in the snow?! If you\ncan\u2019t physically make it to a bar, make\nyour own bar? It is the credit crunch\nafter all...\nSo why not build your bar from\nscratch, placing blocks of snowman on\ntop of each other like lego bricks. You\ncould get carried away and create an\nigloo drinking lodge!\nOr, more realistically, you could simply find a preprepared, snow-covered\nwall to perch against. And this has it\u2019s\nbenefits. It\u2019s a safe and easy place to\nput your drink. Plus, you might require\nsomething sturdy to hold onto later.\nI find the ice underfoot strangely becomes a bit slippier than expected after\na few drinks.\nFinally, don\u2019t forget the fabulous\nsnow-themed drinks! I garnished my\nmohito with a sprinkling of snow. I call\nthis new cocktail a sno-hito! Wow! And\ndon\u2019t forget; that snow drift is nothing\nmore than nature\u2019s beer cooler!\nOkay I\u2019m just messing here. Drinking\nout in the cold is not big or clever, or\nat all classy. It\u2019s one step above drinking cider on a park bench. Be careful\nwith alcohol and snow.

Just email the answer\nto this question to;\nnightlife.felix@ic.ac.uk\nI was stood alone inside Tufnell park\ntube station, just north of Camden.\nThe rain was heavy and unrelenting. I\npaused briefly weighing up my doubts,\nbefore running out headlong into the\nweather. As I carried along the road,\npounding trance beats gradually started to dominate the urban soundscape\nand I felt a warm rush of excitement.\nThen I was inside, walking along\nthe hallway and waving goodbye to\n\u00a310, but as I entered the main room\nmy heart sank. The place was practically empty and wandering around I\nbecame increasingly self-conscious of\nmy solo status. Defaulting to the bar, I\ngrabbed a very reasonably priced pint\nof lager and found a discrete wooden\npost to lean against and take stock.\nThere were two rooms of medium to\nlarge size, both like dishevelled school\nassembly halls. Thankfully the d\u00e9cor,\nwhich consisted mainly of luminously\ncoloured fabric triangles, served well to\ncheer the place up. However, the lighting rigs and sound systems were fairly\nunspectacular, paling in comparison to\nthose of more commercial venues. The\nDJs were playing psy-trance, progressively merged with flavours of house,\nbreaks and other strains of electronica.\nThe music was constantly evolving in\nterms of its rhythmic/harmonic structure and so succeeded in holding my\nattention.\nAs my first pint shallowed, the place\nwas beginning to fill up and there was\na lively vibe developing. Walking outside into the covered smoking area,\nI was soon at ease, sensing that the\ncrowd were generally part of an eclectic community of intelligent, interesting and mostly warm-hearted people.\nThe average age was probably in the\nlate twenties and I soon found that\ndreadlocks, face-paint and flowery\nskirts were all common adornments.\nThe first person I talked to turned to\nbe one of the DJs (Pieman) and before\nI knew it, I was being invited to bring\nmy saxophone along and play at the\nnext event!\nThen I took to the dancefloor. The\nsmooth flowing bass-lines and hypnotically iterative melodies seemed to\nweave connectively through each oth-er. Squelchy saw-waves and ethereal\ntwinkles created a rich texture, expansive and unmistakeable. Dance styles\nconsisted of flowing circular movements and allowed for much interaction between individuals. There was a\nshared space and a shared purpose. I\nno longer felt alone.\nThe night was high-spirited and\ncelebratory in nature. My sense of\ntime began to break down as I gradually became absorbed into the environ-ment. Several hours passed. Periods\nburning energy were punctuated by\nbreaks outside where people shared\nfreely their stories, thoughts and opin-ions. As conversations began to follow\ncertain themes; trips to Goa, the history of trance, communal living and\nmodern revolution, I began to realise\nthat I\u2019d tapped into the vein of a whole\nsubculture.\nThen the trance was broken. The\nmusic stopped and the lights came on.\nThe night was over and the artifice of\npurpose gradually dissolved. I left the\nclub exhausted and refreshed as the\ndaylight revealed pale faces and tired\neyes. In the relative silence people\nslowly dissipated, heading their own\nseparate ways. As I stood on the pave-ment, alone again, I recalled the name\nof the web site that had brought me\nthere, \u2018One Tribe\u2019. For a short time I\nhad been a part of it and maybe I would\nbe again.\nOne Tribe returns on Saturday\n14th February for The 7th Heaven\nValentine\u2019s Special. www.one-tribe.info\nOne Tribe unite on the dancefloor\nAbsolut(ely) Chilled\nIce Ice Baby!

Even without his\npartnerfromDeepHouseSoldiers(Joel\nJackson), his mixing skills kept my attention long enough that I didn\u2019t even\nthink about getting a drink until I had\nbeen in the club two hours already.\nThe only thing that was upsetting\nwas that they were on in the smaller\nBasement rather than the Terrace\nroom. So most people didn\u2019t even realise they were playing. Indeed, this was\nwhat baffled me most about the night\n\u2013 the difference between the music and\nthe crowd. The crowd were unreactive\n(except in their leering) and the music\nsoulful and imaginative, which all in all\nmade for a bit of a bizarre evening.\nThe rotten egg man summed it up\nfor me when he asked, \u201cso who is playing tonight anyway?\u201d\n\u201cThis guy who is kind of a big deal in\nNY. Why are you here then if you don\u2019t\nlike the place and don\u2019t know who is\nplaying?\u201d\n\u201cWell The End is shut now, as is Bar\nRhumba et al and I am not 18 or for\ninto minimalist, so I won\u2019t go to Fabric and I am not yet 30, so I won\u2019t go\nto Koko\u2019s. But I couldn\u2019t sleep; so I\nthought a bit of rotten Egg was better\nthan drinking by myself.\u201d\nO\nn one of the coldest days\nof the year, there is only\none place to go. Absolut\nIce Bar; the coolest bar,\nin temperature at least,\nin the whole of London town.\nAbsolut Ice Bar is a stylish, minimalist paradise. Everything is made of pure\ntransparant ice, from the ice sculptures\nto ice cube glass containing my Absolut vodka cocktail. The beautiful crystal clear ice is sourced from the pure\nsprings of the Torne River in Lapland.\nUpon arrival, a doorman draped us\nin fabulous cloaks to keep us warm.\nThese shiny blue ponchos with a furry\nhood had a \u201cseventies disco elf\u201d vibe\ngoing on, and certainly added fun to\nproceedings.\nTo keep the ice in tip-top condition,\nthe bar is kept at a chilly minus five\ndegrees celsius. \u201cIs this eco-friendly?\u201d\nmy companion asked. I don\u2019t know, but\nthere is certainly no other bar like it.\nOur Absolut vodka cocktail in hand,\nwe sat back in the fur lined ice seats,\nenjoying the futuristic blue lighting\nand smooth ice sculptures. My personal favourite was the ice cube chair,\na \u201860s sci-fi \u201cegg\u201d chair. The combination of intriguing ice sculptures and\nsleek industrial silver floor made my\nslightly drunk companion chuckle,\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t it remind you a bit of the\nCrystal Maze?\u201d. \u201cNo, it\u2019s like a perfume\nad in my opinion\u201d.\nAfter 40 minutes chilling out, it was\nour time to leave. We swept through\nthe fur drapes out into the reality of\nthe cold London streets. \u201cIt\u2019s like leaving Narnia\u201d my accomplice said, and he\nwas quite right. It was a captivating ice\nworld, something out of the ordinary.\nOverall, it was an enjoyable experi-ence, something to save for a special\noccasion. I think Absolut Ice Bar would\nbe ideal for a quick pre-theatre drink,\nas the small icy capacity means time is\nlimited to a disappointing 40 minutes\nper group.\nI am excited to note Absolut Ice Bar\nwill undergo an interior ice redesign\nin April; \u201cAcclaimed jewellers David\n& Martin, former designers for Karl\nLagerfeld, will be transforming the\nABSOLUT ICEBAR into a glittering\ntreasure trove of gemstones\u201d.\nInside the Absolut Ice Bar. Warm clothing are a must\n\u201cThis man knows\nhow to get people\nreally dancing: no\ndrops, no jump up\nbeats, just damn\ngood music.\u201d\nThe smooth bass-lines weaved connectively through each other\n\n"

How can somebody\npull the tablecloth from a\nfully laid table, without breaking any\nof the plates or glasses? Do not scoff, I\nunderstand that you think the answer\u2019s\neasy but for 12-year olds and Business\nschool students it poses something of\na headache.\nThank goodness for the Science Museum therefore, last Saturday they had\nan actor dressed as the esteemed Sir\nIsaac Newton explaining to a group of\n12-year olds (I don\u2019t know if any Business school students were there but I\ndidn\u2019t see any Blackberrys) explaining\nNewton\u2019s laws of motion and, along the\nway, the tablecloth trick.\nThe first law of motion didn\u2019t pose\nvery much trouble. An object moving\nwith constant velocity or at rest, will\ncontinue to move with a constant velocity or remain at rest until a net force\nis applied. This is pretty easy to dumb\ndown for a gaggle of innocent kids\nand offered me the rare opportunity\nto sound knowledgable about Physics;\ndamn you genius 2nd year Physicists.\nTo demonstrate, he dropped an ap-ple, initially at rest, to the floor. What\nmakes the apple fall to the Earth? he\nasked. \u201cGravity\u201d I proudly declared before my 12-year old opponents. What\nis gravity? he continued. \u201cA force\u201d I\nresponded to the annoyance of many a\nparent and their increasingly dejected\nchildren.\nSatisfied that the group had under-stood, but bemused by the presence of\na 6ft 3 sleep-deprived student, Fake Sir\nIsaac Newton continued to the 2nd law\nof motion which he unconvincingly\ndescribed as \u2018his\u2019. The force applied\nto an object is linked to its mass and\nacceleration by the formula. I decided\nnot to risk \u201cdeath by angry parent\u201d and\nremained silent as Fake Sir Issac Newton did his very best to make a group\nof twelve year old boys interested in an\nequation. Noticing his lack of success\nhe swiftly moved on.\nThe final of Newton\u2019s laws and the\nperfect excuse for a grown man in a\nwig to stand on a skateboard. Every action creates an equal and opposite re-action. He stood on the skateboard and\ndemonstrated that when he pushed\nthe ground with his foot, the ground\npushed himself and the skateboard in\nthe opposite direction. Hurrah! The\nbeauty of Physics shown with a simplicity that a 12 year old could connect\nwith.\nNext demonstration, he jumped\non the spot. What provided the force\nthat pushed him into the air? he questioned the audience. A flurry of tiny\nhands rose which consecutively provided the same, wrong answer \u201cYour\nlegs\u201d. A rather larger hand, mine, rose\nand correctly responded with as much\nsuperiority as one can obtain from\nbeing smarter than a twelve year old,\n\u201cthe ground beneath you\u201d. Another\nsuccess for Imperial College London,\nI thought.\nNext, a rocket (or rather a balloon).\nThe air coming out of the balloon\npushes on the air in the room, which\npushed back on the balloon causing it\nto fly crazily around the Science Museum, the actor explained. Even I felt\nlike I was learning something\u2026 Well\nmaybe that\u2019s a bit of an exaggeration I\nthink (or at least I hope) but still, I felt\nlike a new generation of Physicists was\nbeing nurtured around me.\nIf only Fake Sir Isaac Newton had\nstopped there, I might have come away\nwith a positive view of the dumbing\ndown of science for children. But alas\nhe did not. To finish, he addressed the\nconundrum of the tablecloth trick,\nalbeit less dramatically with an apple.\nWhy did the apple remain stationary on the table when not interefered\nwith? \u2018Newton\u2019s 1st law\u2019 a blond-haired\nboy piped up. Ah they were learning!\nBut then why didn\u2019t the apple move\nwhen Fake Sir Isaac Newton suddenly\nsnatchedtheclothfrombeneaththeap-ple? Mmm, this was more complicated.\nWouldn\u2019t the removal of the cloth generate a force which would create an acceleration which would cause the apple\nto move? the actor taunted us. I sensed\nthat if an answer wasn\u2019t forthcoming\nthe children\u2019s brains would overheat\nand shut down. I was ready to exclaim\n\u201cINERTIA!\u201d when crisis was averted\nand Fake Sir Isaac Newton obliged us.\n\u201cThe bumps on the apple, interact\nwith the bumps on the cloth. When\nthe cloth is removed, the interactions\nbetween the bumps cause the apple to\nrise so that the cloth can slip out from\nunder it. Then the apple falls back to\nthe table.\u201d\nLevitation? Instead of explaining\ninertia, this man decided that levitation was a more appropriate tool for\nteaching children the basics of classical\nphysics. This wasn\u2019t simplification or\ndumbing down but simply a lie. Without sounding too indignant, if even the\nScience Museum can\u2019t keep children\ninterested enough in science without\nusing Harry Potteresque explana-tions, then what hope is there for overworked teachers and science-illeterate\nparents?\nBefore you know it, the Science\nMuseum will tell us that electricity is\ncaused by gnomes, hundreds of tiny\ngnomes \u2018high-fiving\u2019 each other and\nrunning around swapping messages.\nFrankly, Ladies and Gentlemen, we\nare doomed\u2026\nKadhim Shubber has lost faith in museums\nT\nhere is something wretched about this city\u2019s soul\nand it spreads its woe with\nall the vigour of a pesti-lence. Everywhere I feel\nthe lash of clockwork\u2019s tyranny upon\nmy back. My senses grow numb from\nthe inhaled vapours of nihilistic odours\nthat throttle me like chlorine. London\ndepletes my spirit, gnaws upon my\nvirtues. London whispers of the death\nof dreams, makes exhibits of medioc-rity. London makes machines of men,\nbuilds hearts from cogs and gears. It is\nthe graveyard of poets.\nAll too frequently in this winter season I am woken at a time before the\nsun has seen fit to rise. With a shrill\nscreech my clock commands me to rise\nand I am pitifully obedient to its order.\nThe timing is remarkably accurate, the\nresonance of quartz crystals allowing\nsuch small error bars when it comes to\ntime keeping.\nIf one divides the majesty of the cosmos into cycles of twenty four units, I\ncan honestly say in submitting my will\nto the chronometer I am able to wake\nat almost exactly the same point in that\ncycle after each period of rest. My flesh\nbegs me to ignore the call, to return to\ndreams, but I am a soldier in the army\nViscount Kensington\u2019s tale of urban pain\nof time and I am well disciplined. Humanity must be ignored, the machine\nknows best.\nI walk through grey streets under\na grey sky to board a train crowded\nwith grey people in grey moods. The\nuniversal detestation of the hour is\npalpable. Ambition long ago became a\nrotting carcass; the hope that one-day\nthe alarm might not go off is the last\nfragment of a testament to its mere\nexistence. But this communal outlook\ndoes not bring those that co-habit this\ntrain closer together. No, each one despises the other. When tightly packed,\nas if in worship of efficiency of space,\nevery annoyance is amplified, every\nindividual reduced to a mere obstacle\nand nuisance. There is no curiosity\nabout others or interest in what wonderful things they could have filled the\nyears of their life with. There is only\nthe firm belief that your world would\nbe so much the better if they were not\nthere, forcing you against a wall. And\nso a crowd is made alone. Company is\nwarped into solitude.\nEmerging from the dark of the tun-nels, I find myself once again amongst\nmaddening crowds, amongst infuriating racket, amongst bleak concrete.\nI go to my prison, where a myriad of\npunishments await me. Sometimes I\nam to sit in a dark room where I record\nin my lab book dark notes about the\ndarkness. Many times I am sent to sit\namong the crowds as an academic,\nwho I know not, instructs me on how a\nuniverse I have never met ought to be-have. Once such things stirred my pas-sion, when the numbers were the tools\nof my trade and I was an apprentice\nto a master. Now I am a number. Now\nthere is the taint of industry about\nit. Knowledge is mass-produced, we\nmerely the faceless, interchangeable\nproducts churned out in a great line.\nAt the end of the process our quality\nwill be assessed and those not up to\nstandard will be discarded.\nMy incarceration comes to a close\nlong after the day has done the same.\nHaving never seen the light of the sun,\nI sometimes look up for the light of\nthe stars. But the stars dare not shine.\nThe light of night is obedient to the\ncity\u2019s will and the city\u2019s timetables. It\nis precisely measured so it might be\nprecisely charged for. Synthetic yellow\nhue conceals the blazing glory of primordial cosmic furnaces. Magnificent,\nbut crushing: if they cannot triumph,\nthere is no hope for me. One wonders\nif the city could not obscure heaven or\nand the city bids a productive morning\nto its recalibrated automata.\n\u201cHe who makes a beast of himself\ngets rid of the pain of being a man,\u201d\nsaid the lexicographer Samuel Johnson. He also said, \u201cA man who can\nchange a prince\u2019s mind is like a dog\nwho speaks Norwegian: even rarer!,\u201d\nbut that is rather irrelevant for the\npurposes of this commentary. London\nhas taken the first statement to heart\nand brought it into the modern age.\nThe city knows that the despotism of\nroutine, the clockwork destiny, can\nbestow us with a hollow purpose and\nmeaningless directive. As a beast we\nabandon thought.\nAs a machine we focus it into a\nmonolith, entirely devoted to the task\nof the hour. We are capable of doing both; we probably should do both\nfrom time to time. Yet I do not think\nwe were meant to do one or the other\nall of the time. But who am I to question the city, to dream of fighting it\u2019s\ntwisted influence? In this place where\naltars most assuredly are nothing but\nmere tables draped in tablecloth, there\nis no salvation.\nWell, until the weekend. Then I get\nto turn that bloody clock off. I really\nwant to go to bed.\n\u201cEverywhere\nI feel the lash\nof clockwork\u2019s\ntyranny upon my\nback.\u201d\n\u201cSoon electricity\nwill be explained\nby hundreds of\ntiny gnomes \u2018highfiving\u2019 each other\u201d\nGilead Amit goes outside. He may be some time\nW\nhat say we go over\nto Primrose Hill\nthis afternoon?\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said,\n\u201cbut I still want to\nwalk through Hyde Park.\u201d\n\u201cLook, your department is not going to be open,\u201d my girlfriend insisted.\n\u201cNobody will be able to get in - all of\nLondon is on pause.\u201d\n\u201cBe that as it may. I am now in London, and in London it is snowing. Hyde\nPark is right around the corner and if\nit\u2019s the last thing I do I am going for a\nwalk through a snowbound Hyde Park.\u201d\nBy this stage I was getting petulant.\n\u201cPrimrose Hill is just as close,\u201d my\nflatmate lied, \u201cand the walk through\nRegent\u2019s Park will be just as nice as a\nwalk through Hyde Park.\u201d\n\u201cNicer,\u201d my girlfriend chimed in.\n\u201cDefinitely\u201d my flatmate repeated\nemphatically, \u201cnicer\u201d. They both gave\nme the same Look one gives a small\nchild who has just kicked his football\nthrough the neighbour\u2019s plate-glass\nwindow \u2013 shattering a small porcelain figure of an elephant and killing\na canary \u2013 and who is well aware that\nthis time he is not going to get the ball\nback.\n\u201cOh, all right.\u201d I grumbled as I skipped\nout of the room.\n\u201cWhy Primrose Hill?\u201d my girlfriend\nasked.\n\u201cI just got a phone call from my sister,\u201d he explained, \u201cand apparently people are sliding down the hill on plastic\nrubbish bags.\u201d\n\u201cCool!\u201d I said, sticking my head\naround the door. I disappeared mo-mentarily. \u201cDo we have any rubbish\nbags?\u201d\n\u201cOf course!\u201d exploded my flatmate;\non which note he marched into the\nkitchen, opened a drawer with great\nconviction, closed it with even greater\nconvictionandlookedaroundinconfu-sion for an instant before triumphantly\npulling open a door and brandishing a\nroll of white bin liners.\nMexican accent.\u201d\n\u201cD\u2019you talking to me?\u201d\n\u201cAch, leave it.\u201d Pause.\n\u201cDoo talking to me?\u201d\nHaving trudged up the slope, we\nfound ourselves in one of the most\nunusual cross-sections of London life\nI can remember being in. Some 300\npeople with an average age of 23 stood\nstamping on the snow, bedecked in a\ndazzling array of colours. A large hat\nattached to a small orange coat that\nturned out to be my flatmate\u2019s sister\nhanded us a large cardboard sheet\nand pointed us in the direction of the\nslope.\nWelookedaroundus.Thewatchword\nof the day, I feel, was improvisatiion.\nImprovised clothing in in unexpected\nweather, improvised transportation in\na paralyzed city and improvised sledding equipment once the three sledges\navailable from Argos had sold out.\n\u201cIf only Woolworths were still alive!\u201d\nwas the almost audible cry of pain.\nWith no official equipment to help\nthem out, the youths around us had\ncobbled together a range of methods\nof descent which were a true testament\nto British ingenuity.\nTo our left, three construction workers in fluorescent yellow lifevests were\ntaking turns on a 3m by 20cm plank\nof wood, whose aerodynamism was\nreceiving envious looks from the couple struggling to make progress on the\nironing board.\nThe four teenagers on the air mattress were too delirious to race it down\nthe hill, and just lay there sleeping on\nthe summit. Next to them, in the centre\nof the throng, an athletic young man in\na camouflage-grey jacket was body-popping relentlessly to the sound of\nan aged boom-box resting on the snow\nbeside him. People were giving him a\nwide berth, but his obliviousness to it\nall was exceeded only by the fervour of\nhis knee-twists.\nOf particular interest to us were the\ntwo youngsters on stolen road signs.\nA tall, greasy-haired object was having great succession with a Deviations\nAhead sign, while his more rotund accomplice kept veering hopelessly off\ncourse on his Men At Work placard.\nWe applauded their initiative, if not\ntheir flagrant disregard for civic regulations and at least two distinct subsections of the highway code.\nAfter half an hour\u2019s preparation on a\nslope of our own construction on the\nside, we felt we were up to the challenge and sidestepped our friend with\nthe boombox to the main slope. Having found a second piece of cardboard\nand wrapped it appropriately, we took\nturns racing down the hill at respectable velocities.\n\u201cLook over there,\u201d said my girlfriend\nsuddenly, pointing at an iced-over\nconcrete path leading down the slope.\n\u201cThat looks like fun!\u201d As a grown-up\nwho gets queasy on the Little Alpine\nTrain at EuroDisney, it looked anything but fun.\nAs she raced off down the path, my\nflatmate and I edged warily over to the\ntop of the slope.\n\u201cNo way am I going down that,\u201d I\ndeclared, digging an enormous Caterpillar Boot into the snow to serve as a\ncrampon.\n\u201cWell, see you back up here then\u201d\nsaid my flatmate as he readied himself\nfor descent.\nI turned away haughtily, forgetting\nabout the hold I had achieved with my\nfoot. I spun inelegantly in the air for a\nmoment before landing heavily on a\nconvenient bin liner by my flatmate\u2019s\nside. With a dignfied inevitability, friction started to abandon me.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d said my flatmate, holding\nout his hand.\n\u201cCome on!\u201d I echoed, grabbing his\noutstretched hand in a distinctly non-homo-erotic manner but rather with\nthe very manly determination one finds\namong parachutists and bungee jump-ers. And marines. Mainly marines.\nShooting down the slope we found\nourselves engaging in the most amazing acrobatic feats in an attempt to\nsend as few toddlers to the casualty\nwards of London as possible. After\ngrabbing the ice with my hands to pull\nus round a couple of young girls going\ndown head-first on a teatray, and letting go of my flatmate so that we could\npass on either side of a man on a snow-board, I found myself looking straight\ninto the eyes of a young woman who\nwas descending with her back to the\nslope. The choice had clearly not been\nhers.\nAs she started braking I was just able\nto roll to my side and pass her, but\ncould hear the yell of panic she emitted\nas my flatmate proved unable to avoid\nthe collision.\nThere was a dull crash, followed by a\njoint scream from the two interlocked\nbodies skidding down beside me. With\nhis right foot trapped between her legs\nand her neck inextricably stuck under\nhis left knee, my flatmate and his victim gathered momentum and quickly\novertook me.\n\u201cLovely day,\u201d I could hear him say.\nSilence. Indefatigably optimistic in\nhis conversational approach, he tried\nagain.\n\u201cCome here often?\u201d\nHaving finally though gawkily arrived\nat the bottom, I staggered to my feet\nand waved the carboard in victory.\n\u201cBehold the sleigh that has conquered the icy slopes of Primrose Hill!\u201d\nI would have cried, if the emotion had\nnot been too much for me.\n\u201cExcuse me \u2013\u201d said a young mother\nnext to me \u201c\u2013 do you mind if Michael\nuses your sled?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d I replied gallantly,\nsmiling at the young boy who took the\nopportunity to throw a snowball in my\nface.\nI handed them the piece of cardboard\nas I stepped over a small child careening maniacally down the hill in a baking tray. The press gang had been right.\nThis was better than Hyde Park.\n\u201cAha!\u201d He cried as he ripped one\nopen and jumped inside. \u201cSee?\u201d\nI saw. So, too, after a moment, did he.\nThe mouth of the bin liner flapped pathetically around his calves.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sliding down a hill on that,\u201d\nsaid a feminine voice from behind me.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go out and get some more,\u201d I\nsaid, retreating into my room to get\ndressed. Some time later, puffed up\nlike a tanned Michelin Man in a vest, a\nturtleneck top, a sweater, a cardigan, a\n7-foot Imperial scarf and a long brown\ntrenchcoat, I opened the door to the\nflat and stood in the doorway.\n\u201cI am just going outside;\u201d I said, fal-teringly. \u201cI may be some time.\u201d The\ndoor crashed in my face.\n...\n\u201cIs that Primrose Hill?\u201d\n\u201cYup. From the top of there you\nget the best view of the city. 70% of\nall films shot in London have a scene\nfrom up there. Three Weddings and a\nFuneral...\u201d\n\u201cAnd its more famous sequel,\u201d I whispered under my breath,\n\u201c... Doctor Who, Notting Hill - the\nlist is endless.\u201d\n\u201cSo the one day we\u2019re going up there\nis the one day we don\u2019t get to see the\nview?\u201d I shook my head in disgust.\n\u201cTypical.\u201d\nI looked ahead at the mound which\nwas beginning to take shape through\nthe falling snow. On top of all that\nwhite I could see a giant black huddle \u2013\nhundreds of small outlines fighting for\nspace and crowding for warmth.\n\u201cAre you sure we haven\u2019t gone too\nfar North?\u201d I asked: \u201cWe seem to be\ninterfering with the Emperor penguin\nmigration.\u201d\n\u201cVery funny,\u201d they lied again, as we\nslowly made our way to the top.\n\u201cYou talking to me?\u201d I asked my flat-mate in what I thought was my best\nHappy Feet manner.\n\u201cNo no - \u2018Jew talkin\u2019 to me?!\u2019 - get it\nright! Robin Williams was putting on a\nblind the eyes of God. Perhaps all sins\ngo unseen here.\nAnd what of the night? The morning\u2019s journey is repeated, with faces\nweary from the deeds of today and\nwith the thought of tomorrow. Brothels light their windows and their less\nexplicit cousins, the clubs, open their\ndoors. Clubs, where people go to be\namongst maddening crowds, infuriating racket and bleak concrete: the difference between a place of leisure and\npublic transport lies in the alcohol. In\nthat poison we find our joy, as every\ngeneration before us has done. We\ndull our minds for when thought is less\nrobust it is less piercing. We stifle our\nsensations so our torture might be felt\nall the less acutely. We find the peace\nof intoxication as the toxin kills our\nreason.\nAnd if, perchance, we should catch\na passing glance of some Aphrodite or\nHercules, then let instinct have its lib-erty. We free ourselves from the shackles of mechanical logic and for a night\nwe are not machines. We are beasts.\nWe pass between the extremes, never\nstopping at humanity. With the caged\nemotion having been permitted to\nstretch its wings, we wake up the next\nday to the shrill screech of the clock\n\u201c\u2018I am in London.\nIt is snowing. I\nam going to walk\nthrough Hyde\nPark.\u2019 I was getting\npetulant.\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n24 felix Friday 6 February 2009\nMusic\nMusic Editors \u2013 Peter Sinclair James Houghton & Alex Ashford\nPeter Sinclair\nMusic Editor\nThe new creative\ngeneration\nT\nhe 1960s saw a renaissance\nof cultural creativity in almost every media, from\nmusic to art to philoso-phy. Rock bands put down\nthe surf-boards and stopped grooming\ntheir side-partings in favour of adopting a more progressive attitude to what\ntheir music could be about, and what\nit could mean to the people listening.\nThe entire creative output of a generation united around the idea that society didn\u2019t actually have to be a slippery\nslope of individualism and social isolation \u2013 it could never be perfect, but it\ndidn\u2019t have to be so shit.\nThe philosophical nature of pop-cul-ture development died on its ass shortly after the hippies all got jobs but their\ngeneration had been defined by its ide-alism. Future generations wouldn\u2019t be\nso lucky. Recessions in the 1970s ravaged the country and the children of\nthis time became the punks, partly as\na reaction to the dire greyness of that\nera. Cue the \u201880s when the rigorous social mechanisation of Thatcherism was\nmirrored by the disjointed, inorganic\nsounds of its pop musicians, much beloved by the nouveau-cool of today.\nThis is where most accounts end. The\n1990s are notable only in their lack of\nany one defining musical movement.\nSelf-conscious, flavour-of-the-month\nmini-revolutions took place in the\nform of grunge, rave, rap-metal \u2013 they\nproduced good music at times, but\nlacked any real mental longevity. And\nhere we are today, children of the MTV\ngeneration, lacking a common musical\npurpose, a rallying point, a \u2018We Were\nThere\u2019 moment.\nHowever human creativity is a tough\none to stifle and, if you can entertain\nthe thought, I would argue that we\n(that is, people of our generation with\nspecial emphasis on the people of Imperial College London) are at the cusp,\nor even in the throws of a musical revolution unlike any which has come be-fore. A revolution not based on shared\nsocial values as in the \u201860s, or a shared\nsense of despair as in the \u201870s, but\nbased rather on the technology which\nis now available to us. Music-making\ntechnology has come a long way since\nthe hyper-awareness of the synthesiser\nmovement of the \u201880s, when people\nwere actually trying to make music\nwhich sounded like it was made by a\nrobot. Now, making music with the aid\nof a computer has become the norm in\nmost genres of pop and on the creative\nedge of this transition, people are using\nit to free the mind from any of the imposed constraints of instrumentation\nor practicalities of arrangement.\nWhen writing music for two guitars,\nbass and drums, an infinity of musical\navenues are instantly blocked. When\nmaking music on a computer, people\nhave virtually instant access to every\nfrequency, every texture, and even the\nmost abstract samples of sci-fi cartoons\nfrom their childhood. As human-com-puter interfacing becomes a hot area of\ndevelopment, the mind becomes free\nto accurately express its variety and\nbreadth. Watching someone playing\naround on Q-Bass who really knows\ntheir way around it is mind-blowing.\nThe new musical paradigm shift will\nnot be started by poncy art-school\nknow-it-alls, but by scientists, engi-neers, technologists, people who learn\ncomputer languages in their spare\ntime, people who own calculators that\ncan do graphs. Embrace the knowl-edge, Imperial College. You\u2019ve got to\nstay in school to keep it cool.\nPavement remastered\nWhat\u2019s on: IC Radio this week\nPavement\nBrighten The Corners: Nicene\nCreedence Edition\nDomino\nHHHHH\nJames Houghton\nIn their native America, Pavement release all of their music under the name \u2018Sidewalk\u2019\nForget Nelson Mandela\u2019s release from\njail and Leslie Nielsen\u2019s birthday, February the 11th is only important for one\nthing; next Wednesday is the twelfth\nanniversaryofthereleaseofPavement\u2019s\nBrighten the Corners. Every two years,\nsince the band\u2019s demise eight years\nago, Domino have been pumping out\ndeluxe reissues of Pavement\u2019s albums\nin chronological order and December\nsaw the release of the latest: Brighten\nthe Corners: Nicene Creedence Edition.\nThe 2-CD, forty-four track long monster contains a remastered version of\nthe original album along with every\nB-side / compilation track / previously\nunheard live and studio track from the\nperiod of the original release.\nThe original album takes its place as\nthe first 12 songs on the box set and really needs no introduction. Whilst arguably their most accessible and consistent album, it still has the trademark\n\u201cForget Nelson\nMandela\u2019s\nrelease from\njail and Leslie\nNielsen\u2019s\nbirthday\u201d\nPavement feel: slightly shambolic, light\nand excited but totally perfect in its\nmess and never unplanned. Album\nopener \u2018Stereo\u2019 starts with Steve Malkmus telling us that \u201cPigs, they tend to\nwiggle when they walk\u201d in an almost\nchild-like manner, setting the lighthearted tone that prevails through the\nmajority of the songs, maintaining an\nincredibly fun and catchy feel without becoming corny or clich\u00e9d. This\nis a great starting place for those yet\nto be enlightened, although die-hard\nfans won\u2019t be overly impressed by the\nremastering which has had minimal\neffect upon the overall sound of the\nalbum \u2013 it is slightly louder than the\noriginal perhaps, but it\u2019s barely noticeable and not enough to cause any substantial clipping or distortion.\nThe inclusion of a huge amount of\nadditional B-sides and rare songs will\nget Pavement fan-boys hot under the\ncollar. Eighteen of the extra thirty-two\nsongs are all previously unreleased and\nthe CDs come with a 62-page book\n(which was missing from my promo\ncopy unfortunately, so I can only guess\nwhat\u2019sinit).Thereissueisworthbuying\nexclusively for the Spit On A Stranger\nB-side \u2018Harness Your Hopes\u2019 which\nis as good, if not better, than most of\nthe original album tracks. It\u2019s hard to\nunderstand why they would leave such\nan excellent song off the album, but\nthen Pavement were never predictable.\nAs Steve Malkmus sings \u201cShow me /\nA word that rhymes with pavement\n/ And I won\u2019t kill your parents / And\nroast them on a spit\u201d, it\u2019s hard to stop\nthat smile spreading across your face\nand his lyrical and rhyming style make\nsure that it stays there throughout the\nwhole album.

For the 24 hours I was\nwithout a phone, I was completely cut\noff from the outside world. I couldn\u2019t\nspeak to my friends, colleges, contrac-tors... anyone! The silence was not wel-come, especially since this has been a\npretty busy week. Being busy means\nlots of phone calls, e-mails and texts.\nSomething quite important. That was a\nRavi Pall\nCoffee Break Editor\ndark time people. All my iPhone would\nsay is \u201cNo Service\u201d. I\u2019m like \u201cwhat the\nfuck do you mean no service?\u201d Thankfully I was saved by the apple man.\nMore specifically, the man at the apple\nstore who kindly changed my iPhone\nover for free. Awesomez!!! Admittedly I\nexpected it to be swapped for free, but\nonly after a struggle with upper man-agement. However this was a pain free\nand easy process. Would you know it,\nmy phone is all fine again, and I can finally call Kadhim Shubber after about\neight weeks of avoiding contact. Well\nmaybe I\u2019ll give it a week, but I can finally go out with the piece of mind that\nI have my phone if I need it. You know,\nto call the police, or a hitman.\nI can haz\niPhone?\nTop Trumps\nCut them out!\nHighest score\nwins\nCollect them all!\nWatch this\nspace for\nadditional cards\nWell, that snow was certainly very ex-citing, but something that is equally if\nnot more exciting is the Annual RCC\nNighthike; one crazy night of clue find-ing, adventurous walking and hopefully a bit of map reading- but if you\ncan\u2019t don\u2019t let that put you off.

First things first. What\nis your status on your year so far?\nYeah it hasn\u2019t gone too badly. We lost\na couple of key players last year, but we\nhave overcome that and everyone that\nhas come in has played really well.\nSo far in our BUCS league, we are\nthird. We should be third but we lost to\nEssex due to what I would like to a call\na \u2018Maradona (Hand of God) Moment\u2019\nwhere one of the opposing players lifted up off their body and into the goal,\nwhich was unfortunate. We should be\nhigher but so far so good. We are doing well.\nAs you said, you have lost some\nkey players last year. What is the\nhistory of the 1st XI? How have\nthey fared over the past few\nyears? Would you call this a good\nor challenging year in general?\nI think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent\nbecause obviously being medics we\nhave got the six years. And we have a\nlot of fourth and fifth years, so we play\ntogether for a long time.\nSo I think we have been consistent,\nbut consistently developing because\nplaying hockey, or any sport at that\nmatter, the longer you play together as\na team the better it gets. Which translates to our team as we have got better\nand better.\nHow have you progressed in your\nfour years to 1st XI captain?\nI was always in the first team. I think\nI have developed in confidence pre-dominantly. It\u2019s part of growing up re-ally, now being over the half way mark\nat med school; you kind of have to be a\nbit more old.\nWhat challenges do you and the\nclub face on a sporting level?\nThe challenge for the first team is\ngaining promotion in BUCS that we\nshould have done years ago. We basically lost out because a team gave\nanother team a walkover, a game they\nwould have won so we didn\u2019t go up.\nThat has kept our level of hockey the\nsame.\nAdditionally, especially in BUCS host\nsuch a small amount of matches, if you\nmess one or two matches up that could\nbe the end of it. Also for us fourth year\nexams are now so a few people can\u2019t\nplay which exacerbates the problem.\nWhat challenges do you face\npersonally? This incorporates my\nfollowing question of what are\nthe best and worst things of being the 1st team captain?\nThe best thing is being able to have a\nsay and to have the respect of the team\nin which you have been voted in and\nthat they listen to what you say.\nWe\u2019re lucky in that our first team\nare really close; we are all a bunch of\nfriends. The hardest part of the job is\nbeing so close to the people that I am\ntrying to tell what to do. Sometimes\npeople can get offended but I try and\nbe and fair and polite as possible when\ndealing with such situations.\nWhat has the standard been like\nthis year? What is the new intake\nof freshers like?\nWe have one really good fresher in\nthe first team who actually took the\nplace of someone we lost year, playing\nat right back, which is fortunate. She\nfits into the team perfectly; she is a really nice girl and is loads of fun.\nWhat about historically? Do you\nalways get a good bunch of fresh-ers in?\nIt varies from year to year. In my first\nyear there were originally six freshers\nwho made the 1st team whereas the\nnext year we didn\u2019t have any and in the\nyear after that one so it depends.\nI am suspicious because since the\nBMAT was introduced to Imperial\nthere have been less and less freshers\nwho make the first team. I don\u2019t know\nwhether people are getting cleverer at\nthe expense of sporting ability?\nWhat is your priority: BUCS, ULU\nor UH?\nWe play UH but that is more of a\nfun thing. UH is just one tournament\nfor us. We normally come second by\ndrunkenly giving our medals away to\nthe winners (GKT).\nOur main target is always BUCS because I believe we can go up and we\nmiss out every year, which is frustrat-ing. I\u2019m hoping at one point during\nmy med school careers we would gain\npromotion.\nI have set targets for the team this\nyear. Everyone has two or three things\nthat they aim to improve on in their\ngame so at least if we don\u2019t do it this\nyear we will get promoted next year.\nWe really deserve it as a team because\nwe work really hard.\nSounds like you have a plan that\nI hope you succeed in. Moving on\nto discuss about how outside influences affect the club, how have\nthe union and/or Sport Imperial\nhelped particularly the first XI in\ntheir sporting endeavours?\nI think Sport Imperial (SI) is bril-liant. They obviously provide us with\nkit and as much as they can, provide us\nwith a pitch for training. Obviously IC\ncome first and they have training on a\nMonday and play on Wednesdays both\nat Harlington but SI fund us to play at\nOsterley on a Wednesday.\nAlissa (Ayling) is amazing. She is\nalways there to answer any questions\nand is at the end of her computer at all\ntimes.\n* Ed - At this point, Lauren still\nhad not receive confirmation that\nher game was cancelled and had\nreceived a number of phonecalls\nfrom her eager team-mates who\ndesperately wanted to know if\ntheir wishes of it being cancelled\nhad been verified *\nApart from your plaudits of SI, do\nyou think there is anything they\ncould improve on? Even if you are\nnitpicking!\nThey could put another astro on at\nHarlington! I read in felix recently that\nthey might be buying land in Ealing\n(Norwood Green). Having two astros\nis important because we have so many\nteams, as medics we have three wom-Lauren Chalmers, the ladies Medicals 1st XI captain braved\nthe Wednesday morning snow to meet Mustapher Botchway.\nen\u2019s teams and two men\u2019s team, then\nyou have to factor in the IC teams as\nwell.\nAt the end of they, if we are renting\nsomeone else\u2019s pitch then SI pay for it\nanyway, so they might as well build two\nnice pitches of the standard of the one\nin Harlington.\nDo you find not playing in a\ncentral location with the other\nmedics, namely Teddington, a\nchallenge, in terms of centralised\ntravel arrangements?\nWell what is difficult for us is that we\ntrain and play in different locations.\nWe train on a Thursday, which at the\nmoment is an issue as we are hungover\nand tired and hungover from Wednesdays so training isn\u2019t as productive as it\nshould be. That is probably one of the\nchallenges as a club where we are trying to change training to a Monday.\nAdditionally we have a Saturday side\nthat IC doesn\u2019t. We play in a ladies\nleague.\nSo, we play our Saturday league\nhome matches at Harlington and our\nWednesday BUCS matches at Osterley\nand the pitches are completely differ-ent. The pitch at Osterly is sand based\nand quite slow whereas in Harlington\nit is rubber crumb based and bouncy.\nThat makes a difference because if\nyou train on a different pitch, you get\nused to a different stick hold and pitch\npositioning.\nDo you err more on to the side of\nparticipation than excellence?\nParticipation, definitely. I don\u2019t think\nanyone is at Imperial to be the best at\nsport, if so they would go to the likes\nof Loughborough or Bath. People are\nhere to work, Imperial is a good university and people are here to study so\nsport shouldn\u2019t be something where\nyou have to work as hard as you study\nas you do on your sport. Sport should\nbe a kind of break from studying. Not\nthat I study that hard!\nOn to the big day. How do you\nthink you will do at Varsity and\nwhat is the history between the\ntwo sides?\nOur history isn\u2019t too favourable for\nus. In my first year we lost by quite a\nlot. However in my second year we had\na brilliant match, I think we lost 6-7\nwhere we conceded in the last minute.\nThe crowds were amazing.\nThe next year we lost again, by more\ngoals than we should have done.\nThis year I think will be an exciting\none. I think we could win this one.\nWe played IC a couple of weeks ago\nand it was an interesting match. The\nscore was 1-1 but we were down to ten\nplayers as one the IC players accidentally broke one of my teammates\u2019 foot.\nWe were also carrying numerous injuries within the team so we were an\nunder strength 10-woman team and\nwe still drew the match in normal time,\nonly to lose 3-1 after extra time.\nI think it\u2019s especially exciting round\nbecause some of us play indoor hockey\nand I think the relationship between IC\nand ICSM is nicer this year.\nI think competitiveness for Varsity is\nkey, nothing is going to change that at\nthe end of the day we are medics and\nAsk the captain -Lauren Chalmers\nthey are IC and that\u2019s what makes the\nevent so exciting.\nI think at least this year though it is\ngoing to be less bitchy because when\nthis happens, you get injuries and it\ngets really stupid. Hopefully there will\nbe none of that; it will be a nice competitive affair.\nHow do the two teams differ from\neach other?\nI think they\u2019ve got quite a fresh team\nwhereas we have a more established\nand experience team I think.\nHow can you describe the atmosphere of the rugby match? And\nA proud hockey geek fathered by Mick Hucknell.\nJudith the \u201cginger winger\u201d is never one to shy away\nfrom a tackle even if it involves salmon diving into the\nground. She always plays with heart and manages\nto spread the hockey love far and wide even to the\ndance floor, where she has taken moshing to a new\nlevel with the aid of JD and coke. Another role she\nhas successfully fulfilled is that of a parasite, a skill\none might say she has perfected. She will commonly\nbe found being fed by her team-mates, however when\nunder duress she manages to produce quite a culinary\ndelight. What\u2019s left to say she\u2019s a rocket fuelled ginger\nnut who will stop at nothing to lead ICSM to victory.\nFACT FILE\nName: Lauren \u2018Judith\u2019\nChalmers\nTeam: ICSM Ladies\nHockey 1st XI\nPosition: Centre Midfield\nDate of Birth: 31/12/1986\nHometown: Maunden\nCourse: 4th Year Medicine\nHeight: 5\u201d4\nWeight: 40kg\nhow do you think it has changed\nover the years?\nI think everyone has different opinions on the match. Some people are\nmore anti-IC than others and vice\nversa whereas some people have better\nrelationships with one another.\nI think it\u2019s a mixture of intensity, cordiality and competitiveness, but it all\nends in a drunken mess where people\nare shouting and screaming!\nThe atmosphere has stayed pretty\nconstant over the years. Last year it\nwas really exciting as the match was\nmore exciting as we let it slip a little\nthat rallied the IC troops together.\n\n"

The Sri Lankan army has encircled the Tigers, but aid agencies\nsay 250,000 people are stuck in Tiger-held areas. Many have sought safety in\na government-declared no-fire zone or hospitals, but even those have been\nhit by artillery attacks and cluster munitions.\nThe International Red Cross and the United Nations have long been active\nin delivering aid throughout this conflict, but both have been careful not to\naccuse either side of being responsible.\nSri Lanka\nThe Japanese electronics giant Panasonic has announced it will make redundant 15,000 people from its 300,000 global work force as it attempts\nto cut costs.\nDue to plummeting demand for its plasma TVs which is part of a wider global trend of lower consumer spending on luxury goods, Panasonic made its\nfirst annual loss in six years. Half of the redundancies will be made in Japan,\nwhile the other half in overseas\nmanufacturing factories.\nJapan is the world\u2019s second\nlargest economy and it depends heavily on exports, consumer electronics being a large\nchunk of this. Panasonic\u2019s announcement has come on top\nof similarly massive job cuts by\nJapanese firms NEC, Sony and\nHitachi.\nJapan\nLibya\nThe African Union\u2019s (AU) newly elected chairman, Colonel Muammar\nGaddafi, has criticised democracy in Africa while speaking at this week\u2019s\nAU summit in Ethiopia.\nLibya\u2019s leader, who seized power in a military coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in 1969, said that\nAfrica\u2019s tribal political parties, which reflect the social structure of many\nparts of the continent, have only led to bloodshed. Instead African countries\nshould model themselves on his own country\u2019s system, where no opposition\nparties are allowed.\nThe AU\u2019s decision to select Colonel Gaddafi as its head for the coming\nyear is a controversial one. Despite his recent openness, he has a history of\nconfrontation with the west, and a poor human rights record. However his\nplan to drive forwards African unity through the \u2018United States of Africa\u2019\nmodelled on the EU may offer new-found hope for many struggling nations.\nArtsFest is coming\u2026 and\nthis time it\u2019s bigger\nT\nhis year\u2019s committee have\ncooked up a feast of creative little treats for you to\nget your teeth stuck into,\nliberally sprinkled over\nthe week of the 16th to the 20th February. Whether you\u2019re a secret Spielberg,\nbudding ballerina or veritable virtuoso,\nget your cha-cha-cha out of the closet\nand get on down to one of the plethora\nof events that will be happening across\ncampus. It\u2019s all in aid of Hospices of\nHope, which helps terminal children\nin Romania and the surrounding\ncountries.\nIf the whole Strictly Come Dancing\nthing managed to pass you by, aside\nfrom being an obvious sign of spending far too much time in the lab, ArtsFest offers another chance to see what\nall the fuss is about. Dance, one of\nImperial\u2019s most popular clubs, will be\nholding the final round of their version\nof the competition as part of Friday\u2019s\nfinale concert, seeing your favourite\nlecturers (and DPCS Lily Topham)\npairing up with (arguably the most pa-tient) members of the club to rumba,\nwaltz and tango their way to victory.\nIf you\u2019re uneasy in the ballroom, you\u2019ll\nalso find performances around campus\nfrom ghetto-fabulous Funkology and\nthe boys\u2019-favourite-on-a-Wednesdaynight-in-Sherfield, Dance Company.\nAnd of course there are the wonderful musical offerings from Imperial\u2019s String Ensemble, Wind Band,\nChoir and highly acclaimed Symphuni\n2008-winning ICSO, not to mention a\nspecial performance from the grownup accomplished professionals that\nmake up Onyx Brass, held every lunchtime in the College\u2019s Main Entrance. By\nfinding these mellifluous gems snuggled between the Tanaka and Mech\nEng buildings on your way back from\nthat cheeky Subway visit (because the\nJCR just isn\u2019t the same\u2026), hopefully a\nrare and tiny smile will be brought to\nthose geeky and neglected sandwich-encrusted lips. If you can\u2019t tell Stravinsky from Strauss, Monday\u2019s Music\nTech and Tuesday\u2019s Jazz & Rock nights\nin dB\u2019s cannot fail to excite even the\nmost modish of auditory nerves, whilst\nWednesday\u2019s Barnce (barn + dance\n= see what we did there?) is hillbilly\nenough to leave all red in the neck.\nIf you\u2019re really after something differ-ent, look out for Parkour, Wushu, Capoeira and Filipino Martial Arts, who\nwill be tumbling and fighting their way\nthrough College solely for your pleas-ure. And you don\u2019t have to be well-rehearsed or fully-versed to take part;\none can tread the boards at DramSoc\u2019s\nworkshop, or engender some potentially Turner-worthy doodles on the Blank\nCanvas in Sherfield. If all this sounds\nlike you\u2019ll be enervated by mid-week,\nwhy not put your feet up on Thursday\nat FilmSoc\u2019s movie screening, or take a\nwander to LeoSoc and PhotoSoc\u2019s exhibition in the Blyth Gallery?\nAnd if all this still fails to tickle\nyour fancy, ArtsFest 2009 still has\nsomething up its little purple sleeve.\nWednesday sees the Village Fete Until\nLate; with cakes, a tombola, balloons\nand bunting just like the good ol\u2019 days\nwhen we were all so tiny and innocent,\nexcept with added booze from Real Ale\nand Fine Wine societies, inflatable sex\nsheep, and a Kissing Booth, where for\na nominal fee you can be graced simultaneously by the lips of two attractive\ngirls both named Lauren.

Bus services were stopped\naltogether for the majority of the\nday and even South Kensington\nunderground station had to be shut\ndown.\nWith little if any warning, departments decided to cancel all teaching activities on the Monday citing\nsafety concerns and the inability of\nstaff to arrive promptly. This information was not relayed to the\nstudents in a promptly fashion, and\ndespite the immensity of the snow\nand failure of public transportation,\ndroves of dedicated students still\nfound their way to lecture theatres\nand labs early in the morning. Upon ar-rival, these students found themselves\nalmost alone and understandably upset after the tardiness of departments\nin sending out emails informing of the\nday\u2019s plans.\nWhile the weather conditions eased\nsignificantly on Tuesday and with public transportation almost back to nor-mal, most engineering departments\nand the humanities department still\nfelt it necessary to cancel lectures for\nanother day.\nAround South Kensington, filled\nwith a sense of euphoria, students\nfilled their time with typical snow day\nactivities. A giant snowball fight broke\nout in front of the Royal Albert Hall\nand saw hundreds of Beit and Southside Hall residents engaging in some\nlight-hearted inter-hall rivalry. Police\ncars were reported on the scene. A Beit\nHall senior mentioned that despite the\nfriendly nature of the fight, authorities\n\u201cfeared a riot\u201d. Hyde Park also played\nhost to a myriad of Imperial students\u2019\nantics and proved to be the perfect\nplace to engage in fort-building and\ncanoeing down slopes.\nDespite melting snowmen around\ncampus, departments and College\nservices and facilities are now fully\noperational.\nAfonso Campos\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n5\nFriday 6 February 2009 felix\nNews\nWhile casually flicking through the BBC news website, I came across a story about\na radiographer who spent over 8 hours, including 18 miles walking, a train journey\nand hitch-hiking in order to get to work at Guys Hospital in London. What is exceptional is that his bosses weren\u2019t even particularly surprised at the level of commitment he had shown to getting into work, but please he had managed to make it in.\nThis tale of commitment to a job was thrown into stark contrast against the \u2018snowdays\u2019 taken by the people elected to run Imperial College Union. President, Jenny\nMorgan, is reported to have told her fellow Sabbs not to bother coming in on Monday or Tuesday as the snow was causing transport difficulties and there probably\nwouldn\u2019t be anyone in the Union. What felix cannot understand is why the Union\ngo to so much trouble to get places in halls for Sabbs, when college struggled to find\nplaces for all of the freshers this year. Surely the idea of having Sabbs within walking\ndistance of campus is that they can make it into college come rain, shine, or mass-breakdown of the transport system?\nWhile the felix editor braved the \u2018snow\u2019 on Tuesday to make it into work, having\nspent Monday \u2018researching\u2019 how the snow was affecting students, the DPEW and\nDPCS were nowhere to be seen on either days, despite living minutes from campus.\nSurely if there was one day of the year where decisions on the education and welfare\nof students were being taken in fast and pressurised situations in every department,\nit was this Monday? And while services all over campus were struggling to cope\nor decide whether to close altogether, the Sabb in charge was presumably making\nsnowmen in Princes Gardens, or tucked up in cosy student halls. Other sabbaticals\nhave elected not to stay in halls and so could be forgiven for being thwarted by the\ncrippled public transport system, along with the rest of us mere-mortals.\nStudents who trecked for up to an hour through the snow, with no busses in sight,\nmight be slightly hacked off to learn that the people elected to work for and represent them, thought a five-minute walk was too much to ask.\nAlice Rowlands\nSabbs take Snow Day\nphotos by ravi pall and richard lai\nIsrael\nWith national elections coming up this week, Israeli voters are transfixed in an election campaign dominated by\nthe recent war in Gaza and\nissues of national security.\nIsrael has a proportional representation system, meaning the number of seats a party wins is directly proportional to the number of votes received. Thus a single party is unlikely to\ngain a majority in the Knesset (parliament), meaning coalition governments\nhave to be formed which has caused instability in the past.\nThe three major parties, Likud, Kadima and Labor are the major players\nbut each are not expecting more than 30% each. About 40 other parties with\nhugely varying interests and objectives are also competing.

Iraqis\nexercising their right to vote were visible once again on Saturday 31st January 2009 when they went to the polls\nin local government elections. They\nbrandished their purple-stained fingers\nto the cameras as they left the polling\ncentres having cast their vote for one of\n14,000 candidates, 4,000 of whom are\nfemale, who were competing for only\n440 seats in local provincial councils.\nFor the last few weeks, Iraq\u2019s streets\nhave been awash with campaign posters from over 400 political parties advertising their candidates. It is a far cry\nfrom the last election in 2005 where\nmost candidates were too scared to\nput their faces on campaign posters,\nfor fear of terrorists knowing who they\nwere, instead campaigning under their\nparty list. Now TV stations have been\nfilled with politicians debating in per-son, vying for the votes of viewers. It\nis an even further cry from the show\nelections of 1995 and 2002, when then-President Saddam Hussein was reelected with 99.96% of the vote.\nLast week\u2019s elections were an important test for the country\u2019s young\ndemocratic political system which\nwas established after the US invasion\nin 2003. The period of campaigning\nwas relatively violence-free with only\nfive candidates killed and election\nday itself took place without any major bloodshed. UN observers said that\nprocedures were good, and the average turnout was 51%, lower than the\n76% seen in 2005. Of course there have\nbeen claims of violent intimidation\nand cash handouts for bribes in some\nareas, and despite the plethora of can-didates, the five major political parties\nwith the most funding dominated at-tention. But by adopting democracy,\nIraq has adopted its virtues as well as\nits vices.\nThese provincial elections have also\nbeen seen as a precursor to national\nelections to be held at the end of 2009,\nwhich will mark the completion of a\nfull four year term of Prime Minister\nNouri al-Maliki\u2019s government which\nwas formed after the last national election in December 2005. Good results\nfor political parties now will foretell\ngood results in the coming national\nelections too. Many never thought\nMaliki\u2019s government would last its\nfull term, predicting its collapse in the\nface of numerous crises during the last\nthree years.\nThere are those within Iraq and outside it, who have criticised Maliki and\nhis government, calling them \u2018puppets\nof the Americans\u2019. The USA invaded\nIraq in 2003 and installed a regime that\nwas friendlier to its oil-related interests in the region they argue. Let\u2019s look\nat what Maliki had to say about the\nrecent conflict in Gaza: \u201cAll Arab and\nMuslim countries should cancel their\ndiplomatic relations and stop all contacts \u2013 public and private \u2013 with this\n[Israel\u2019s] murderous regime.\u201d Earlier\nin 2007 Senator Hillary Clinton (now\nUS Secretary of State) called for Maliki\nto be removed from office, to which\nMaliki hit back by saying Democratic\nsenators were acting as if Iraq was\n\u201ctheir property\u201d and that they should\n\u201ccome to their senses\u201d and \u201crespect\ndemocracy\u201d.\nConversely Nouri al-Maliki has\nalso been criticised for acting like an\nautocrat by establishing himself as a\nstrongman, leading to comparisons\nbeing drawn between his government,\nand the previous one of Saddam Hussein. For Maliki it seems like a case of\n\u201cyou\u2019re damned if you do and you\u2019re\ndamned if you don\u2019t.\u201d If he is receiving\ncriticism from both sides, he must be\ndoing something right.\nDemocracy in Iraq is still developing of course; its 25 million inhabitants\nhad never experienced such a system\nof governance before 2003. Living\nmemory consisted of 35 years of dictatorship by Saddam Hussein and his\nBa\u2019ath party. Iraqis got used to fearing\nthe police and other security forces,\njournalists were not accustomed to\nthe concept of criticising the government and civil servants were used to\ngiving and receiving favours and other\ncorrupt practices. In short the whole\npolitical culture in Iraq was turned on\nits head after 2003 and the democratic\nsystem cannot be expected to function\nperfectly straightaway.\nThat said a remarkable amount of\nprogress has been made in the almost\nsix years since the fall of Saddam. For\nexample30%ofMembersofParliament\nare women, as required by the minimum quota of 25% stipulated by the\nconstitution \u2013 that\u2019s a higher percentage than in the US Congress and UK\nHouse of Commons. In neighbouring\nKuwait women only received the right\nto vote and stand for election in 2005,\nand even then not a single woman won\na seat in their last elections; other Arab\ncountries average 10%.\nThe fact is that Iraq is only the second democratic Arab state, the first\nbeing Lebanon. Men like Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, King Abdullah of Jordan or the Sheikhs of the various Gulf\nStates don\u2019t have to worry about winning elections. Other Arab states have\nsecretly delighted in seeing Iraq mired\nin daily suicide and car bombs which\npeaked in 2007. It reassured them that\na Shia-dominated government in the\nregion will be short-lived and served\nsome of their anti-American agendas\nas they could point to Iraq and say to\ntheir people \u2013 \u201cthis is what democracy\nand freedom brings, you don\u2019t want\nthat here.\u201d But with the reduction in\nviolence since early 2008, this is no\nlonger the case. The so-called purple\nrevolution, a reference to the ink-stains\nmarking the index fingers of Iraqi vot-ers, in this election and past elections\nafter 2003, is making the autocrats and\ndictators of the Arab world shaky and\nincreasing the calls for change from\ntheir people.\nOutside of politics, improvements\nare visible in many areas of Iraqi so-ciety. Now instead of contracts being\ngiven to foreign companies to build\npresidential palaces and supply military equipment, there are contracts\nfor infrastructure like roads and power\nstations. In December 2008 the Ministry of Electricity placed an order to\nSiemens for 16 gas turbines for new\npower stations. During the period of\nviolence, the only businesses that were\nflourishing were coffin-makers and\nconcrete manufacturers (to make blast\nwalls). Now that a degree of security\nhas returned to the streets, small businesses and shops are starting to pick\nup where they left off, boosting the\nlocal economy. Regular international\nflights have recently begun operating\nfrom Baghdad Airport again, Kurdish\ncities like Erbil are implementing massive reconstruction projects and overall a degree of normality has returned\nto many areas.\nAdmittedly Iraq still faces dozens of\nproblems. There are still car bombs\nand the security situation is still measured by the number of civilians killed\nper month. Public services, especially\nin health, education and sanitation,\nstill suffer from years of neglect. There\nis also the danger of the US military not\nkeeping to its promises in the Withdrawal/Status of Forces agreement.\nDespite these challenges, the progress\nof the past few years \u2013 as symbolised by\nlast week\u2019s elections \u2013 is a strong sign\nof a bright future for ordinary Iraqis.\nAmerican soldier passes a wall covered in posters in Baghdad\u2019s hotel district, promoting the recent elections\nFew thought that Nouri al-Maliki\u2019s government would last their four year-term in the face of criticism\nPeer attacks our freedom of speech\nParliament as an entity and political\ninstitution which has developed over\nhundreds of years and out of time has\ngrown into two houses; the House of\nLords and the House of Commons.\nThe history of the House of Lords dates\nback to the late 12th century when the\nkings of old required some advice on\nwhat to do with England. As a result\ncouncils were held with the barons and\narchbishops and it is the latter, which\nin this context, is important. Today in\n2009, Lord Ahmed, the only Muslim\npeer in the House of Lords, has managed to threaten his fellow house into\nsubmission over matters spiritual. Not\neven when England withdrew from\nthe then-mighty Catholic Church in\n1534, through the Acts of Supremacy,\ndid Parliament falter \u2013 whose liberties have been forged through centuries of religious intolerance. Yet when\none intolerant Muslim peer decides to\nadmonish the entire corps of Lords,\nthey succumb... In the words of King\nGeorge III \u201cWhat? \u2013 What?\u201d\nA member of the House of Lords enjoys the same freedoms which are bestowed upon a member of the General\nPublic, those of freedom of expression,\nfreedom of association and other more\nspecific parliamentary privileges in\nplace to protect their function in the\nlegislature. It must have come as quite\na surprise to one of the Lords when she\nfound out that Lord Ahmed threatened\nto take her to court because of one of\nher devious deeds. The Lord in question had invited a fellow parliamentarian from the Netherlands to a private\nviewing of his \u2018documentary\u2019 with her\ncolleagues followed by discussion and\ndebate.\nThe Dutch MP in question was\nGeert Wilders, writer of the controversial \u2018documentary\u2019 Fitna \u2013 a \u2018documentary\u2019 of 17 minutes in length which\nfeatures a selection of Suras from the\nQur\u2019an, interspersed with media clips\nand newspaper clippings showing and\ndescribing acts of violence or hatred\nby Muslims in reference to the Suras.\nThe intent of the feature was to demonstrate that the Qur\u2019an and Islamic\nculture in general incites violence.\nThe sheer bigotry and extreme bias of\nMr. Wilders aside; the \u2018documentary\u2019 is\nnot in question here but the actions of\na member of Parliament. Lord Ahmed\nraised nothing short of hell, for reasons\nyet to be disclosed, when he discovered\nthat the Lord in question was going to\nprivately screen Fitna in the House of\nLords with her colleagues \u2013 possibly\nhe was not invited and wanted to make\nhis feelings known. Nonetheless Lord\nAhmed is reported to have \u201cthreatened\nto mobilise 10,000 Muslims to prevent\nMr. Wilders from entering the House\nand threatened to take the colleague\nwho was organising the event to court.\u201d\nAside from this statement transmitting\ndisturbing waves of Stalinism, Lord\nAhmed appears to have forgotten that\nhis own government passed the, albeit draconian and arbitrary, Serious\nOrganised Crime and Police Act 2005\n(sections 132 to 138) which banned all\nunlicensed protests outside of Westminster. Thus even if Lord Ahmed\nmanaged to assemble \u201810,000 Muslims\u2019\nto prevent Mr. Wilders from entering\nWestminster, it is questionable if he\nwould get a license to prevent a democratically elected MP of the Netherlands, entering the governing house of\nGreat Britain as a guest of a baroness,\none wonders what he would put on the\napplication form. Possibly it is implied\nbut for the sake of distinctness, the\nscreening has been cancelled.\nLord Ahmed is manifesting a notion of Divine Right. His execution of\nthe Labour peerage is laudable; he is\none of the founding members of The\nWorld Forum whose aim is \u201cto become\na global platform for World Peace,\nwhere discussions are held with a view\nto promote a \u201cDialogue among civilizations\u201d and with the hope of building bridges of understanding among\npeople, cultures, religions, and civilizations based on principles of mutual\nrespect, tolerance and human values,\nand justice.\u201d Why this does not apply\nto the British Parliament remains an\nenigma. On the contrary, Lord Ahmed\nis not concerned to protect freedom of\nexpression or freedom of speech but\nto stifle debate and ensure that Parliament only engages exclusively in dou-ble-speak. Alas the last line of defence\nfor the baroness remained the Lords\nSpiritual. It was hoped that they might\nenter the melee, it was hoped that they\nmight defend the rights of the House\nto extend an invitation to anyone\nwhom they so wish, even a democratically elected foreign MP. Their silence\nis deafening. They no longer believe\nanything strongly for fear of causing\noffence and to the eyes of men it was\nthus unveiled who the true cowards\nwere and are forevermore to be.\nSo, finally when Parliament could\nnot be shamed further, the noble Lord\nAhmed went to the Pakistani press to\nboast about his achievement; he had\nsuccessfully curtailed the two corner\nstones of a liberal democracy; freedom\nof speech and freedom of association,\nand this he calls \u201ca victory for the Muslim community.\u201d\nNeil Dhir\nThe Houses of Parliament in Westminster have been under much scrutiny by the public and the media recently especially within the House of Lords.\nAn insight by our Politics correspondent into the controversial inner-workings of the House of Lords\n\n"

According to a\nnew study by the Centre for Studies and\nResearch in Cognitive Neuroscience at\nthe University of Bologna, confabula-tions can be reduced by distracting attention away from a memory task\nUnlike people with some types of\nmemory loss, confabulators are not intentionally creating memories to cover\nup the embarrassment of memory\nloss. Instead, they are not aware that\nthey have created false memories; this\nmakes sufferers vulnerable as they cannot distinguish between real memories\nand their confabulations. The condition can be caused by brain damage\nto the prefrontal cortex. Dementia, a\ntype of memory loss often associated\nwith Alzheimer\u2019s disease, can result in\nconfabulation. Another cause can be\nthe severe malnourishment that results from repeated continued alcohol\ndependence. It is specifically vitamin\nB1 (thiamine) deficiency which also\ncan lead to this confabulatory memory\ndisturbance.\nDr Elisa Ciaramelli and her research\nteam carried out a study involving\npatients with lesions in the prefron-Scientists have developed a mathematical model to explain why dating\ncan be a drawn out process, claiming\nthat dating statistically gives females a\nbetter chance of successfully evaluating males as suitable sexual partners.\nThe researchers used game theory\nto construct a dating game, allowing\nthem to investigate the strategies men\nand women employ during the dating\nprocess. The game only ends when the\nfemale agrees to mate or when one of\nthe parties gives up.\nProfessor Robert Seymour, University College London, one of the authors\nof the study suggests that the findings\n\u201cmay help explain the commonly held\nbelief that a woman us best advised\nnot so sleep with a man on the first\ndate.\u201d\nThe model classifies men as either\n\u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d, where bad males are\nthose who are less likely to care for\nchildren after mating. Good males are\nprepared to court the female for longer than their bad counterparts. Men\nscore points if they mate with any\nfemale, whereas women only score if\nthey mate with one of the good males.\nThe results suggest that women benefit from a longer courtship process,\nnot only because they have more time\nto assess the man but also because bad\nmating partners are more likely to give\nup earlier.\nThe co-author of the study Dr Peter\nSozou, London School of Economics,\nexplains: \u201cThe strategic problem the\nfemale faces is how to screen out bad\nmales, and this is where long courtship\ncomes into play. A male is assumed to\nThink less, remember\nbetter?\nNew research published this week\nin the journal Neuron suggests that\nnewborn brain cells \u2018time-stamp\u2019 our\nmemories providing them with a time-code unique to all memories formed\naround the same time.\nUntil now, scientists struggled to\nexplain why we tend to remember\nthings that happened at the same time\nmore easily than events that occurred\nat different times. For example, when\nyou think about a movie that you saw\na few weeks ago, you are also likely\nto remember the cafe you went to\nafterwards.\nBrad Aimone, a neuroscientist from\nthe University of California, San Diego, and his colleagues set out to explain why a certain part of the brain,\nthe dentate gyrus, continuously produces new cells.\n\u201cAt least one percent of all cells in\nthe dentate gyrus are immature at any\ngiven time\u201d says Aimone. \u201cIntuitively\nwe feel that those new brain cells have\nto be good for something, but nobody\nreally knows what it is.\u201d\nThey plugged all the existing biological data about these cells into a computer programme designed to simulate the neural circuits in the dentate\ngyrus. The results showed that these\nyoung cells were easily excited by all\nthe incoming information that they\nwere forming into new memories at\nthe time; however, as they matured\nthey assumed their fixed place in the\nmemory circuitry and did not respond\nto new information.\nThis means that independent events\nthat have nothing else in common but\nthe fact that they take place around\nthe same time become linked because\nthey all stimulate the same young\nbrain cells that are storing memories\nof those events.\nThe team concludes that \u201cBy labeling contemporary events as similar,\nnew neurons allow us to recall events\nfrom a certain period.\u201d\ntal lobe, including patients with and\nwithout confabulation, and healthy\nindividuals.

So by paying less attention during memory processing, the\nmemories are less likely to \u2018go wrong\u2019.\nThe findings that were published\nin February edition of the journal\nCortex could pave the way forward\nfor new cognitive treatments to train\nconfabulating.\nPaving memory\nlane\nalways want to mate with a female, but\na good male is more willing to pay the\ncost of a long courtship in order to\n\u201cA good male is more willing to pay the cost of long courtship in order\nto claim the prize of mating\u201d\nResearchers have captured images of\nbleeding inside the human heart after\na heart attack the first time.\nThe research shows that the extent\nof bleeding after a heart attack can indicate how damaged a person\u2019s heart\nhas become. The researchers, from\nthe Clinical Sciences Centre at Imperial College London, hope that this\nkind of imaging will be used with existing tests to assess a patient\u2019s chances of recovery. Dr Declan O\u2019Regan\nfrom the Clinical Sciences Centre\nsaid: \u201cWe hope that this will help us\nto identify which patients are at most\nrisk of complications following their\nheart attack.\u201d\nThe researchers captured images\nof bleeding inside the heart of 15 patients who had recently suffered a\nheart attack, using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The MRI scanner could detect the bleeding because\nof the magnetic effects of iron which is\npresent in blood. Analysis of the scans\nrevealed that the amount of bleeding\ncorrelated with how much damage\nthe heart muscle had sustained. Those\npatients who develop bleeding inside\ntheir damaged muscle have a poorer\nchance of recovery.\nThe small study, published in the\njournal Radiology on 19 January, offers new insights into the damage that\nheart attacks can cause. But it is not\nyet known how significant the bleeding is. Dr Stuart Cook, the study\u2019s senior author said: \u201cWe still have a lot of\nunanswered questions about whether\nthe bleeding itself may cause further\ndamage to the heart muscle and this is\nan area that needs further research.\u201d\nThe research was funded by the\nMedical Research Council, the British Heart Foundation and the Department of Health, UK.\nBleeding hearts revealed by\nscan\nUmia Kukathasan\nMico Tatalovic\nScience Editor\nLouisa Garnier\nBell Seth\nScientists to explain the\nbenefits of dating\nLess concentration=better memory?\nThe colored area on this MRI scan shows a cross-section of the heart\nmuscle, with the area of bleeding shown in red.
