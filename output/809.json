The department believe that\nthe number of staff student contact\nhours is excessive and all lecture\ncourses will be cut to accommodate\nthe changes. Independent Mapping\nprojects over the Summer holidays\nwill continue during the second\nyear.\n'In the past we have tended to\nover lecture which is bad for staff\nand students,' explained Dr Richard\nSelley, Head of Department.\nThe move is part of a general\nrestructuring within the department\nwhich, amongst other changes led\nto the introduction of a group\ntutorial system at the start of the\nyear. The department are also\nconsidering the introduction of atf ii rd year option in Management\nScience.\nNew\noffices\nA new office block for companies\nliaising with Imperial College is\ndue to be constructed in the space\nbetween the Civil and Electrical\nEngineering Departments. The\nOffice Block, containing twelve\noffice suites is due for completion\nby September 1989. The suites\nwill be let out on short term leases\nto companies who are making use\nof Imperial College's research\nfacilities. The cost of the building\nis estimated at a quarter of a million pounds.\nStudent\nvouchers\nThe Government is considering\nintroducing student vouchers as a means of funding universities,\naccording to a report in the\nGuardian. Under the proposal\nUniversities would not be funded\ndirectly, but students would be\ngiven a voucher to be spent on a University of their choice. The\nscheme is reported to be receiving;\ngrowing support from academics\nand Vice Chancellors.\nDeath on\nthe\nThames\nThe recent ULU Sri Lanka Society\nDinner and Dance was ruined\naccording to FELIX eye in the sky\nreporter, Charles Brereton, when\nthe boat crashed into a bridge.\nThe starboard side of the craft was\n'completely wrecked' and two\npeople were injured as the skipper\ncorrected too late to avoid a collision.\nPanes of glass were ejected and\nICU Deputy President Charles\nBrereton told FELIX that 'if it hadn't been safety glass it could have been\nbloody carnage'.\nHe went on to say 'it ruined our\nevening. It could have been death\non the Thames'.\nFisher\ngets new\nlocks\nFollowing two break-ins earlier this\nmonth, the College plans to install\na new lock system in Fisher Hall in\nEvelyn Gardens. The existing ten\nfront door entrances will be reduced\nto three. A 'Corley' magnetically\ncoded key system, similar to that\ninstalled in Montpelier Hall aye at ago, will also be fitted to the front\ndoors.\nThe current Union and Yale\nsystem will be replaced by an\n' EWA' master key system at a total\ncost of around \u00a36000 from the\nCollege residence account.\nManaging Surveyor of Residences, Peter Hallworth, told FELIX\nthat the external door locks will be\ninstalled by the beginning of ne xl term although the internal locks will\nnot be replaced until Christmas due\nto problems with delivery.\nFinance\ngo-ahead\nEstimates from clubs and societies,\napproved by Union Finance\nCommittee for next year will be\nfulfilled despite a cut of \u00a34000 by the\nCollege.

At the\nsuggestion of Dartmouth College,\nNew Hampshire he repeated the\ncourse at the College and updated\nversions, given alternatively in the\nUK and USA bacame a regular and\nprominent event in the engineering\nworld. Neil's qualities as a communicator were soon revealed\nand after won for him many awards\nin both countries for the excellence\nof his lectures and papers; he was\nsubsequently greatly in demand as\na lecturer and industrial consultant\nin the UK, continental Europe, the\nUSA and Asia.\nDespite the time and effort\nrequired by these activities Neil was\na fully committed member of his\ndepartment at Imperial College\nwhere he willingly continued to\nshoulder heavy teaching and\nadministrative duties.\nNeil's zest for work, his straight forwardness, his readiness to help\nothers and his complete absence of\negotism were qualities which made\nhim a colleague who will greatly be\nmissed.

It was\npossible to sit in your tent on the\ncampsite and catch every note.\n.^Saturday dawned clear and bright\n/ but by lunchtime, and the start of\nthe entertainment, rain was\nthreatening.

    "content": "Opinion\npassages from Isaiah. This all\nreaches a climax with the\nappearance of Jesus Christ in\nAmerica after his Resurrection\nappearances in Jerusalem.\nApparently then, Christ chose to\nrecant His words in John 16.10:\n'...because I go to the Father and\nyou will see me no more...,' and to\ndisprove Mark's words in MK 16.19;\n'...the Lord Jesus after He had\nspoken to them, was taken up into\nheaven, and sat down at the right\nhand of God.' Rather, He went to\nAmerica and preached over there.\nThe more improbable the history,\nthe more attractive it seems to be.\nFor example, the Jews were\napparently transported to the\nAmericas in pre-Christian, dish-shaped submarines, which had the\nfacility of plugged air holes, to be\nunstopped upon surfacing, and\nwhich were lit inside by magically\nglowing stones. Miraculously the\nvessels reached the other side of the\nAtlantic all together and intact, with\nthe task of establishing a community\nthen being taken in hand. One\nproblem with the history, although\ncarefully mapped out to avoid\ninconsistencies, is the glaring\npresence of anachronisms, such as\nthe 'compass' (not invented until\nthe twelfth century AD) and the\nrather too familiar references to the\n'horse' (which was not introduced\nto America until the Europeans\narrived).\nActually the history is the least\nsignificant pointer to the Book's validity, for the prophesies and\ndoctrinal assertions are far more\niU um in a ting in this respect. Without\nbeing too detailed, it is worthy to\nnotice that the Book's prophesies\nregarding Jesus Christ far outstrip\nthe accuracy of the Old Testament;\nand despite the Mormons' holding\nthem to be evidence of the Book's divine origin, it is easier to see this\nrather as prophesy in retrospect. For\nexample, Jesus' mother has her\nname prophesied, 'Mary' and her\nconnubial state 'Virgin'. Neither is\nprophesied in the Old Testament,\nfor although Isaiah 7.14 does for see The most offensive\nfact about\nMormonism is its\ntotal into le rence for\nanyone else\nChrist's birth hundreds of years\nbefore the event, the Hebrew may\nperhaps better be translated a 'young woman'. ('Behold, a 'young\nwoman' shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name\nImmanual (God is with us).) That\nmost Christians believe in Mary's virginity before Christ's birth is not\nthe issue, since what is being shown\nas over-accurate prophesy and a distinct obsession with making\ncertain doctrinal points too\n-bund ant ly clear\u2014which leads to\nthe next consideration.\nIn light of Smith's disgust at the\nChurch for its wars over doctrinal\nissues, would it not seem only took\nlikely that 'he' should pack the Book\nof Mormon with clear\ncommandments which once and for\nall settle all the arguments? Indeed\nwe find just this. When viewed in\nthis manner, the whole book\nbecomes transparent in a flash, for\nit is certain that whole chapters have\nbeen constructed for the sole\npurpose of making one or two\nassertions, embellished heavily of\ncourse with quasi-historical\npadding. Examples include the\narguments over the existence of hell\nand the state of the soul at death,\nand whereas the Adventist's were\narguing that Scripture may be\ninterpreted as disclosing the fact of\n'soul-extinction' at death and\n'annihilation' of the wicked as\nopposed to everlasting torment, the\nBook of Mormon improves on\nGod's Biblical revelation by bluntly\naffirming eternal torment and the\ntransitional life of the soul between\ndeath and resurrection. I am not\nThe doctrines run\ninto clear heresies\nendeavour ing to favour either view\nhere, but simply illustrating my\npoint. Another important one (yet\nironical in view of later teaching by\nSmith) is Christ's deity. It is\nsignificant to understand that\nalthough His deity is clearly taught\nin the Bible, it is never stated bluntly\nin a way completely immune to\nmisinterpretation. But again the\nissue is not here, but the fact of\nSmith's 'clarifications'. Christ is\nfrequently and directly called God,\nin a way that permits of no personal\ndiscovery, and which rather\nobscures the beauty of the Trinity.\nAnd now their weakest area\u2014\nJospeh Smith himself. Regarding\nthe above, 'Smith's' divinely\ninfallible translation of the Book of\nMormon clearly affirms the doctrine\nof the Trinity (again far more\nclinically than the Bible), and yet\nSmith is documented as having\npreached on the 'plurality of gods',\nin utter contradiction to the\nTrinitarian position, and today you\nwill find that the Trinity is not\nfashionable for the contemporary\nMormon, for he has been informed\nby Smith since the translation of the\ninfallible Book, that he, and every\nother faithful Mormon, shall reach\nThe Mormons\nclearly state that all\nother Christians are\nof the Devil\nequality with God the Father at\nsome future date, and then proceed\nto govern his own universe in much\nthe same way as our God (once\nhuman like us) governs the present\none. This sort of contradiction is far\nfrom unique, and I feel it casts\nfurther doubt on Smith's authorship\nof the Book, which is the subject of\nthe final paragraph. Also Smith's character is somewhat in doubt.\nApparently, he at one point eloped\nwith a young lady since her father\nwould not countenance their\nmarriage, for the reason that he\nknew Smith to have spent much\ntime engaged in searching for\nhidden treasure with the aid of\nmagic 'peep stones'. Although the\nobservation will seem immaterial to\nthe 'materialists', it is worth noting\nthat the practice of divination is\nexpressly forbidden in the Bible, and\nthat this occupation hardly lends\nweight to the Mormon's evaluation\nof Smith as a seeker after Truth. As\nis the case with the Jehova's Witnesses with regard to the\ndoubtful character of their founder\nCharles Taze Russell (prosecuted for\nselling 'miracle wheat' at exorbitant\nprices, amongst other things), the\nMormon's are not keen on\ndiscussion of Smith's character, and\nseem to know little about him. Any\naccusation against him is, of course,\nimmediately assumed to have been\nfabricated and to be Satanically\ninspired\u2014which brings me to their\nview of the Church.\nPerhaps the most offensive fact\nabout Mormonism, is its total\nintolerance for anyone else at all. So\nmuch for Christ's prayer for the\nunity of His Church in John 17\u2014the\nMormons clearly state that all other\nChristians are of the Devil. Again\nthis is fundamentally an assertion,\nfor looking at the general doctrinal\nteaching of the Book of Mormon\n(supposedly the basis of belief).\nThere seems to be little difference\nbetween them and evangelists. So\nwhat is the problem? It is the pure\nassertion that the Mormon Church\nis, without good reason, the Only\nChurch and so has unique authority\nto disciple Christians. Then of\ncourse with the extra teaching, the\ndoctrines run into clear heresies and\none is left with non-Christian\nOrganisations with great power\nover its members, built on the\nfoundation of a manifestly spurious\nBook, which seems Christian. The\nMormon danger is in shifting\nSalvation through Christ onto the\nOrganisation. (From a Christian\nperspective, it might well be\ninjudicious to suppose that all\nMormons are necessarily not\nChristian, for it is surely conceivable,\nthat some of them do know Christ,\ndespite the clear fact that\nmembership of the Organisation is\nnot conducive to encouraging this\nrelationship.)\nAnd finally, Smith did not write\nthe Book. The Mormons claim that\nhe translated it in a few days, and\nthat this time constraint and his\nsemi-illiterate state verify the\nmiraculous nature of the events.\nAgain this is odd logic. As you will\nremember, Smith had four years of\nrelative inactivity in which to write\nit (or copy it) in his own handwriting\n(had that been necessary), and\nalthough theories suggesting Smith\nto have possessed a dual personality\n(one side dull\u2014the other containing\nhidden brilliance) have been\nforthcoming, surely the obvious\nsolution points to his having either\nThe Jews were\napparently\ntransported to the\nAmericas in pre-Christian dish\nshaped submarines\npersuaded someone to write the\nbook for him, or to his having been\nused by someone else as an unlikely\nprophet to astound the credulous.\nWhatever, as mentioned previously,\nSmith's subsequent teachings are by-no means always consistent with\nthe very carefully defined doctrinal\nassertions of the Book, and so his\nauthorship is probably out of the\nquestion. And these later teachings,\nit must be recalled are in no way less\nauthoritative than the Book, even\nthough they conflict heavily at\ntimes, making the whole\ni Organisation a house built on sand.\nAugust 26 1988 FELIX Page 5\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion\nGod Chose America\nJulian Butcher casts a critical eye over the\nfaith and beliefs of the Mormon church.\nI think we are all aware of the presence of the Mormon Church with its\nimpressive gold steeple immediately opposite the Mechanical Engineering\nbuilding, but it is surely less certain in most people's minds as to who\nthey are or what they believe. Often they are regarded with some caution,\nbeing seen as not quite on a par with evangelical Christians, indeed rather\nmore readily being equated with the Jehova's Witnesses due to their\nmutual door-knocking activities. For many they seem to be just another\ndenomination, after all their name seems quite inoffensive\u2014'The Church\nof Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints', and of course, the Mormon choirs\nare reasonably famous and respected throughout the western world.\nPerhaps the only well-known peculiarity about them is their history of\npolygamy, which found its way into the faith under Brigham Young, but\nwhich is no longer encouraged. My intention is to show that Mormonism\nis full of peculiarities, that it is not Christian and that its foundation is\none of blind faith.\nA short history runs something\nlike this: In the early part of the last\ncentury a young American lad, who\nwas a 'keen seeker after Truth',\nfound himself totally exasperated by\nthe disunity in the Church. He was\nparticularly averse to the doctrinal\nnit-picking and apparent impotence\nof the Church with regard to\nspiritual gifts from God\u2014(eg\nprophesy, healing, etc). The lad's name was Joseph Smith, and\ndespite his having received a poor\neducation, he was chosen and\nenabled by God to perform a great\ntask. This task was declared to him\nby an angel, who appeared to Smith,\nwhilst in prayer, and who informed!\nSmith was\nmiraculously able to\ntranslate 'Reformed\nEgyptian' into\nEnglish\ni him of an ancient set of gold and\nbrass plates, which contained many\n'precious' things that had been\nomitted from the Bible, and which\nhe was then required to translate\ninto English. For four years, on the\nsame date each year, the angel took\nhim to the hill in which the plates\nwere buried, but not until the fourth\nyear was Smith allowed to view the\nwriting. Eventually however, the\nbox was opened (with the use of a lever) and the plates revealed,\ntogether with a pair of divine\nspectacles the Urim and Thummim)\nwith which Smith was miraculously\nable to translate the 'Reformed:\nEgyptian' spontaneously into\nEnglish. This he claimed to have\ndone, and the \"Three Witnesses',\nDavid Whitmer, Martin Harris and\n...Mormonism is full\nof peculiarities...\nOliver Cowdry testify to this.\n(Martin Harris was the financier for\nthe first publication). (Interestingly,\nthe Mormons claimed to have\nconsulted a respected authority on\nhieroglyphics with regard to the\n'Reformed Egyptian', who is said to\nhave recognised the characters and\npraised the text for its unique\nquality. In a later letter however, he\ndenies this vehemently.)\nThe result of all this was the Book\nof Mormon\u2014Another Testimony of\nJesus Christ, which was claimed by\nSmith to have equal (if not superior)\nauthority with the Bible. After all,\nif God had miraculously generated\nperfect translation through the Urim\nand Thummim, the Book of\nMormom must be devoid of all\nerrors and other translation\nproblems, (such as idiomatic\nvariations and chr.n ged emphases\netc). Indeed he accepted the Bible's authority only insofar 'as it was\ntranslated correctly', which\n(although seemingly innocuous)\nactually exposes the Bible Scripture\nto be subject to any and every whim\nof Joseph Smith. Granted it is no\nlonger generally used, but Joseph\nSmith's version of the Bible includes\nextra passages 'clarifying' certain\ndoctrinal position, which have no\nbasis in early manuscripts\nwhatsoever. The Book of Genesis\nfor example includes completely\nThe Mormon Church in Exhibition Road\nnew passages concerning the\nrebellion of Satan, which Smith has\ninserted with impunity; since the\nBook of Mormon explicitly states\nthat the Mormon Church leadership\nenjoys the privilege of direct\nrevelation from God, the authority\nof which is comparable to that of\nScripture, if not superior to it.\n(Hence polygamy under Brigham\nYoung, when both the Bible and the\nBook of Mormon blatantly condemn\nthe practice). This fact of 'divinely'\ninspired leadership (with apparently\nlittle constraint) is clearly the most\ndisturbing aspect of Mormonism, its\nfoundation is shaky and open to\nabuse; especially in light of the fact\nthat for the Mormon, God can be\nseen flatly to contradict Himself in\nScripture and revelation.\nThe Book of Mormon claims to be\na set of historical writings, handed\ndown from generations of Jews who\nhad travelled from the Middle East\nto settle in America around 600BC. Most of the pages are preoccupied\n'\u2022ith boring pseudo-histories of\nwars, factions and prophesies (and\nof course genealogies).

Work has already begun\non the refit, which, the Union\nhopes, will encourage more\nstudents to use the Union facilities.\nThe new Snack Bar will contain\nseating for one hundred people and\nwill feature a lowered ceiling and an\nimproved lighting system. The new\nserving area has been designed to\nreduce queueing time and will run\non a self service basis with an extra\ntill at peak times. The Uni6*n are\nbuying new cookers, a food mixer, a dishwasher and new cutlery and\ncrockery for the Snack Bar. The new\nSnack Bar will feature fabric\nwallpaper and will be decorated in\nwhat has been described as a subtle\nred, white and blue style. In\naddition, vending machines offering\nconfectionery, sandwiches, rolls and\nhot and cold drinks will be installed\nin the dining area.\nA catering consultant has been\ncommissioned by the Union to\nimprove the range of food on offer.\nUnion Manager, David Peacock told\nFELIX that new Snack Bar will be\ngeared towards healthy eating with\nvegetarian, low sugar and low fat\nfoods. One or two meat dishes each\nday are also planned. 'We are trying\nto help people get into a good eating\nkick,' he said.\nThe seating currently in the Snack\nBar will be moved into the\nEntertainments Lounge. A new\nstage is to be constructed in the\nLounge along with a new lighting\ntower, paid for by the College, and\na storage area for Entertainments\nCommittee. The Dramatic Society\nwill be installing new disco lights for\nthe Union, and the Lounge will be\nrepainted. The room will be\ncarpeted and a Dance Floor\ninstalled. Plans are also being\nconsidered for a second food outlet\nor a bar behind the serving hatch in\nthe lounge.\nIn the Union Bar, woodwork will\nbe sanded and stained and new\nbrass lighting is to be fitted. The\nwooden panels at the bar entrance\nare to be replaced with glass panels\nin an attempt to make the bar more\nwelcoming and the stonework will\nbe cleaned.\nSpeaking on the modifications,\nDeputy President Chas Brereton\nsaid 'we have to compete with\nCollege and offer a good service to\nstudents. If we don't get them in the\nfirst week we lose them forever.'\nA raised dias originally planned\nfor installation in the Snack Bar over\nthe Summer has been delayed until\nthe Christmas vacation following a disagreement within the Union\nOffice over the choice of contractors.\nUnion Deputy president, Chas\nBrereton told FELIX that former\nUnion President, Sydney Harbour\nBridge had asked a second firm to\nproduce a quotation for the dias\nwhen the original contractors,\nFrancis Bell and Austin were felt to\nbe too costly. When the new\ncontractors were found to be even\nmore expensive it was too late for\nthe original contractors to install the\ndias in time.\nIn addition to the work being\nfunded by the Union, the College is\nproviding \u00a320,000 to refurbish the\nUnion Central Staircase and the\nmain toilets. The toilets, currently a gents, will be converted into toilets\nfor male and female students.\nUnion President Nigel Baker said\nthat he was relieved that work had\nstarted and added 'the Snack Bar\nwill be a hell of a lot less like a refectory'.\nStudent\nUnions\nsurveyed\nStudent Unions are alarmed by a nationwide survey launched by the\nDepartment of Education and\nScience (DES). The survey asks for\ndetailed breakdowns of union\nfinances, and voting procedures. It\nalso contains an extensive section\nasking unions to evaluate the\nservices they receive from the\nNational Union of Students (NUS).\nA twenty-one page questionnaire\nhas been circulated to the ViceChancellors, Directors and\nPrincipals in seventy universities,\npolytechnics and colleges of further\neducation. Brunei, Heriot-Watt,\nBristol, Loughborough and\nNewcastle Universities are amongst\nthose on the list.

Mr Baker said the\nGovernment recognised that 'many\nindividual students do not wish to\nbe represented by \u00b0the National\nUnion of Students.' He went on to\nsay that taxpayers' money should be\nused to provide services for students\nand not for political campaigning.\nThe survey shows a number of\nsimilarities to an Early Day Motion\non the 'National Union of Students\nclosed shop' put forward by\n. continued on back page.\nISSUE 809 26 AUG 1\n9\n\n"

I would like\nto point out that the article does\nnot necessarily reflect the views\nof FELIX or of the Editor. I have\nto say that I visited the Mormon\nChurch on Exhibition Road earlier\nthis week and that the people\nthere were very friendly and very\nsincere about their faith. I would\nhope that Members of the\nMormon Church would take the\nopportunity to put forward their\nside of the story.\nOpinion articles will be a regular feature in FELIX this year.\nThey represent your opportunity\nto put forward your views.\nArticles on any subject will be\naccepted provided they are not\noffensive or anonymous,\nalthough, with good reason,\nnames may be withheld from\npublication at the editor's discretion.\nThe Union Refit. The refurbishment of the Union Refectory\nand the Union Lounge is not\nbefore time. Over the years the\nUnion Building has been allowed\nto degenerate to its current\nshabby state. It is not surprising\nthat students have shown little\ninterest in the Union and its\nfacilities. The -refit is the most\nsignificant thing the Union have\ncarried out in a long time.\nThis issue would have been\nmuch worse if it were not for the\nvaliant efforts of the staff. Thanks\nto Dave Smedley for looking after\nthe news, Doug King for taking\nthe photographs, writing about\nCropredy and dashing across half\nof London for a picture of\nKenneth Baker, Steve Meyfroidt\nfor his wacky paste ups, Dave\nClements and Nigel Baker for the\nPG page, and Julian Butcher for\nhis opinion article.\nXT ISSUE...NEXT ISSUE...NEXT ISSU\nThe next issue of\nFELIX will be on\nSeptember 8th Letters and\ncontributions\nwelcome\nISSUE...NEXT ISSUE...NEXT ISSUE...NE\nCalling all Postgraduates\nPostgraduate articles in FELIX are\nusually very few and far between,\nbut that is now all going to change,\nI hope. We have a PG reporter for\nFELIX, we have three summer PG\nFELIXES promised (this being\nnumber two), and we have a new\nand enthusiastic PGA O( Postgraduate Affairs Officer,\nnamely myself, Dave Clements)\nwho is going to write some of these\narticles. All in all the aim is to let you\nall realise that there is a complete\ncollege outside the lab with activities\nto offer you and help to give you if\nyou are having problems, and that\nthere are plenty of people involved\nin running the place who are trying\nto make Imperial a better place to do\nPhDs and MScs.\nThe first question you may well\nask, is what have we done up to\nnow? Aside from the social aspects\nof the PG Group at IC (yes there is\none), which provides money for\ndepartmental PG events, and\narranges some events centrally,\nsuch as the PG Squash Tournament\nyou will have read about in the last\nissue, we have been making it easier\nfor you to get help in departments\nwhen things are going wrong. Up\nuntil last year many departments\ndid not have a Postgraduate Tutor,\nsince such a post was not required\nby College. I have certainly found\nthe PG Tutor in Physics, who have\nhad one for many years, to be very\nhelpful in offering impartial advice\non various aspects of my research.\nThe good news is that now the\nCollege have seen that such posts\nare a good idea and have asked\nevery department to assign a member of staff to the position of\nPostgraduate Tutor. You'll find a list\nof these below. You can now go and\nsee these people if you have any\nproblems you need impartial advice\non, or to discuss matters you do not\nfeel you are able to discuss with\nyour supervisors.\nHowever, we are not going to\nstop there. While the PG Tutors will\nbe able to help with individual\nproblems, more general difficulties\nand comments, about lecture\ncourses for example, or PG common\nrooms, are not so easily handled by\nthis route. Traditionally\nrepresentations to departments on\nsuch matters has been the job of the\nDepartment Representatives (Dep\nReps) who are almost always\nundergraduates. They do not feel\nthey can adequately represent PGs\nand in many cases neither the PGs\nor Dep Reps know that this is part\nof their job. We are therefore\nproposing a system of Postgraduate\nDep Reps. Once chosen/elected,\nthey will be responsible for PG\naffairs within their department.\nThese will be mainly social and\nacademic matters. They will also sit\non the PG Affairs Committee with\nthe Union President and the PGAO.\nTo raise issues within their own\ndepartments, they will be\nencouraged to set up their own\ndepartmental PG committees, with\nhelp from the PGAO and Union\nPresident, with representatives from\neach research group or section. An\nMSc representative should also sit\non the committee from each major\nMSc course in the department. This\nwill result in a formal structure\nthrough which PGs will be a bie to\norganise events and discuss\nproblems with their departments\nand the Union. This is shown\nbelow.\nIt is understood that some\ndepartments already have\ncommittees similar to these, and so\nless work setting up the system will\nneed to be done in those areas.\nOnce these committees are set up\nand running, it will then be possible\nto ask College for a Senior PG Tutor\nwho would be responsible for all PG\nacademic matters. David\nGoodgame, who will take over as\nSenior College Tutor in October, is\nin favour of this idea and so there\nshould be no real problems in\ngetting someone appointed to this\npost. The Senior PG Tutor will come\nfrom a different department from\nthe College Senior Tutor so that\nstudents have the option of talking\nto someone outside their\ndepartments if they so wish.\nAt present undergraduate\nstudents fill in lecturer evaluation\nsheets at the end of the year so that\nthe performance of individual\nlecturers can be assessed. It is hoped\nthat this will be extended to lectured\nPG courses and PhD supervisors in\nthe near future, and it is proposed\nthat this will be done through the\nPG committees.\nThere are some fairly radical ideas\nin the scheme outlined above, with\nthe first major obstacle being the\ntraditional Postgraduate apathy\nDave Clements (PGAO)\nabout anything not directly related\nto their field of study. However, we\nj feel that this is very important, both\n'for helping individual PG students\nthrough the problems that some\ninevitably face^ and so as to improve\nthe overall level of supervision and\nPG course at the College. This\nshould eventually lead to better\nthese submission rates and a generally higher standard in IC\npostgraduates.\nWhat we need from the\npostgraduates in the College now is\nsome feedback on the ideas we have\npresented above and we'd also like\nto hear form anyone interested in\nbecoming a PG Dep Rep. We will be\nholding an open meeting in the\nUnion Dining Hall (that's on the\nfirst floor of the Union Building) at\n12.30pm on Thursday 1 September.\nAnyone with comments on these\nproposals will be most welcome, as\nwould anybody who is interested in\njoining in with the social activities\nof the PG Group, which will be\nexpanded next year.\nWe can, of course, discuss any\nspecific gripes or problems you have\nthere or after the meeting.\nHope to see you all at the PG\nmeeting on 1 September.\nDave Clements PGAO\n(Astrophysics)\nNigel D Baker, Union President.\nPG Affairs Committee (Chaired by PGAO)\nAero Biochem\nRep Rep\nMRE Physics\nRep Rep\nir~ r~i \u2014 i Aerodynamics Aeronautical Structures\nI11111 Individual Students\nAugust 26 1988 FELIX IV- 3\n\n"

More recently, Mr\nJanman proposed an amendment to\nthe Government Education Reform\nBill. The amendment has been\ndescribed by the NUS as an attempt\nto outlaw union affiliation with\norganisations which do not provide\ngoods or services.\nMaeve Sherlock, NUS President\ntold FELIX that the amendment\ncould have affected union affiliation\nwith sports leagues as well as with\nthe NUS.\nSports\ncup win\nImperial College has won the\nUniversities Athletic Union HG Messer trophy for the most\nimproved College in this year's mens' sports championships. The\nmens' team came 12th out of 41\nColleges, an improv ment of 22\nplaces.\nT Knew we'd done well by getting\na few teams in the top 16 but I didn't think we'd done so well overall' said\nAthletics Clubs' Committee Vice\nChairman, Mark Harris.\nImperial managed to achieve\nplaces in the top sixteen in many of\nthe sports. The overall winners of\nthe Championship were\nLoughborough University, with\nBirmingham University in second\nplace. Imperial College has been a member of the Universities Athletic\nUnion since 1983.\nFurther computer\nthefts throughout\ncollege\nSince FELIX reported on computer\nthefts two weeks ago a further\n\u00a314,000 worth of equipment has\nbeen stolen.\nThieves operating between\nWednesday and Friday last week\nhave stolen two printers, one a laser\nprinter from Electical Engineering,\nand a complete system valued at\nover \u00a3 1 0 , 0 0 0 from Mechanical\nEngineering.\nOn two occasions keys were used\nto gain access to the equipment,\nleading College Security to believe\nthat current or ex-members of\nImperial College may be involved.\nSecurity Officer Terry Briley\ncommented 'Imperial College is\nhere to produce research and we are\nlosing our product as a result of\nthese thefts'. He added that Security\nwere doing their best to control the\nthefts but urged College members\nto be more aware of security and to\nlock doors and challenge strangers\nat night.\nLocal crime prevention officers\nwill be co-operating with security to\nadvise fresher s on crime prevention\nnext term.\nPaper recycling\nProject launched\nThe Ideal Paper Recycling Company depot receives another scrap paper delivery.\nImperial College Union has\nlaunched an eight week project to\ninvestigate paper recycling on\ncampus. The project aims to set up\na pilot recycling scheme at IC and\nto produce a report for distribution\nto other Universities, on the\nscheme's feasibility.\nThe project is being funded by\nFriends of the Earth and the\nUndergraduate Research\nOpportunities Programme (UROP)\nto the tune of \u00a31000.\nRichard Heap, the student\nselected to conduct the study told\nFELIX that white printed paper,\nphotocopier paper and\ncomputer paper where potential\nsources of income. He said that\nthree recycling schemes were under\nconsideration m clu ding a prop so sal by Westminster City Council which\nwould involve free refuse collection\nin return for waste paper.\nTrewin Restdrick told FELIX that\nFriends of the Earth have received\na number of enquiries on paper\nrecycling in universities. He went on\nto say that the project, if successful,\ncould be reciprocated in other\nuniversities.\nNews\nEvelyn\nhouses\nmerge\nMining House and Southwell\nHouse, in Evelyn Gardens, are to be\njoined to form a hall for 160 or so\nstudents by the beginning of next\nterm. Ken Young, the present\nWarden for Southwell House, will\nbe Warden for the new hall.\nThe decision to merger the houses\nwas taken when Catherine Brown,\nWarden of Mining House, resigned\nto complete her PhD and Mr Young\nwas appointed as Warden of\nSouthwell House. The move is in\nline with the present Student\nResidence Committee (SRC) policy\nto move towards larger halls and\nshould lead to an overall increase in\nthe number of student rooms in the\nhall.\nThe SRC are also to consider the\nmerger of Willis Jackson House and\nHolbein House next year. SRC\nChairman, Brian Levitt told FELIX\nthat the present all male Holbein\nHouse and the mixed Willis Jackson\nHouse may be interchanged in time\nfor next year.\nThe cost of converting the two\nhouses into one, by knocking walls\nthrough and converting triple rooms\ninto doubles and singles will be met\nby funds left to the Coliege by Mr\nPR Monk, an ex-lecturer at\nImperial. The legacy of around\n\u00a380,000 was left by Mr Monk to\nprovide accommodation for\nmembers of staff. The new hall will\nhouse Mr Young and his wife in a larger Warden flat than is presently\navailable and will provide further\nstudent rooms from the second\nredundant Warden flat. The naming\nof the new hall is currently under\ndebate although 'Southwell Hall'\nand 'Monk Hall' have been\nmentioned as possibilities. Imperial\nCollege President, Nigel Baker, told\nFELIX that he and Mr Young\npreferred 'Monk Hall' as a possible\nname since they felt that renaming\nit 'Southwell Hall' could lead to ill-feeling from Mining House drinking\nclub, \"The Diggers'.\nNew!\nProfessor G.

It is possible to see the\nhumour in lines such as; \"You\nwanna pack suicide in if it's just\ngonna depress you\" when Decker\nis contemplating throwing himself\noff the top of the hospital building.\nThe idea of going out with a 'bang' occurs to the two men when\nDecker mentions a whorehouse on\nfive floors \"Like a parking garage\"\nin Amsterdam, and they finally\nagree that stealing an ambulance is\nactually the most appropriate and\npractical way of fulfilling their final\nambition. Although very eager to\nget to the attractions of 'Sin City',\nthey think that their luck is in when\nthey see two girls next to a broken\ndown 2CV and decide to stop to\nlend a hand believing that the two\nfemales must be French. They are\nnot French, and on closer inspection\nit is doubtful whether one of them\nis actually a woman or a giraffe.\nTimothy Dalton and Janet McTeer\nas the pregnant Hazel, fill the screen\nwith an almost slap-stick comedy to\nmake even the most depressed\nperson feel happy. Go and see this\nfilm and come out of the cinema\nwith a smile on your face and\npossible a tear in your eye (quite a combination, eh?).\nRose Atkins.\nDREAM\nDEMON\nDream Demon is a British-made\nhaunted house thriller in the old\nHammer tradition. Diana (Jemma\nRedgrave) is to marry Falklands\nhero Oliver (Mark Greenstreet).\nUnfortunately, her subconscious\ncan't quite come to terms with the\nidea and it's easy to see why.\nDiana's dreams are full of images of\na married life in which one partner\nsomehow always seems to be\ndecapitated. Bound to end in tears,\nreally.\nThe dreams become worse after\nthe arrival of the punk-rocking\nJenny (Kathleen Wilhoite) from Los\nAngeles (where else?). Adopted as\na child and whisked away to\nAmerica, Jenny is trying to trace her\nnatural parents, whose last known\naddress is Diana's marital home.\nShe rescues Diana from the clutches\nof the local gutter press (Jimmy Nail\nand Tim Spall) who are after\nOliver's 'length', as it were. From\nthere, it all goes horribly wrong.\nJenny and Diana have the power to\ntrap people in their dreams and turn\nthem into hideous parodies of what\nlooked uncannily like Roy\nHattersley. The dreams become\n| more and more horrific until the\nI truth of Jenny's past is revealed.\nDream Demon is certainly a very\nfrightening film, not least because\nit marks the screen debut of yet\nanother Bloody Redgrave. The\ndisturbing special effects were\nproduced by Animated Extras of\nAliens and Company of Wolves fame\nand the atmosphere is heightened\nby some well-freaky music from Bill\nNelson.\nIf Fatal Attraction made the men\nwho saw it think twice about having\naffairs, Dream Demon should be the\nfilm to make women think twice\nabout getting married in the first\nplace.\nRob Causey.\nSHAG\nApparently, Americans have\nabsolutely no idea that the word\n'Shag' has anything to do with sex,\nin fact, I often wonder if Americans\nhave any idea about sex at all and\nthis film in places, would certainly\nserve to confirm my thoughts.\n'Shag', according to this film, is\na dance, well a kind of foot shuffle\nreally, specially designed for the\nyoung middle-class white kids (not\na black face in sight apart from the\nthe big fat mama cleaner who comes\nout with things like; T ain't seen\nsuch hawn y white f ow ks bef aw'). Oh well, this dross must appeal to\nsome people.\nRose Atkins.\nAugust 26 1988 FELIX Page 7\n\n"
