He spoke\nabout the significance of Chanukah and mentioned\nan ancient Talmudic debate regarding the use of one\nof the Menorah\u2019s candles to light another.\nThe lighting had been organised by Chabad on\nCampus in South Kensington\u2019s director Rabbi Mendy\nLoewenthal. The Chabad had also organised a Menorah lighting outside the Gloucester Road underground station, which saw crowds of over 50 people\nattend its Sunday lighting, and a Menorah in the\ntunnel of the South Kensington underground station\nwhich was featured last year in the Imperial College\nstaff newspaper \u201cReporter\u201d.\n\u201cThis is positive event\u201d said Rabbi Mendy Loewenthal, director of Chabad of South Kensington \u201cpeople\nare happy to support the Menorah\u2019s message of freedom for all people and we like to promote it\u201d.\nFor more information on Chabad on Campus in\nSouth Kensington please visit www.SKchabad.com.\nWomen in\nSurgery\nF\nemale surgeons: a rare breed, and\nthe thought of whom still earns a\ncurl of the upper lip from the (all\ntoo prevalent) misogynistic male medical students. Though medical school entrants comprise 55% female students,\nto this day only 8% of consultant surgeons are female. The Women in Surgery event, held by the ICSM Surgical\nSociety on Tuesday evening sought to\ndispel some of the worries that plague\nfemale surgical students.\nMiss Alexandra Cope, General Surgeon in the Oxford deanery described\nher career from student to registrar\nsurgeon and remembered her purchase\nof a BMW Z3 as a real turning point in\nher surgical training career \u2013 \u201csuddenly\nall the blokes viewed me differently, bizarrely it made me one of them.\u201d\nThe key speaker of the evening was\nEmeritus Professor Averil Mansfield\nCBE, the UK\u2019s first female professor of\nsurgery. Described by the Guardian as\n\u201cthe first lady of the theatre\u201d, Professor\nMansfield held the position of Vice President of the Royal College of Surgeons\nfrom 1998-2000, was last year\u2019s President of the BMA and was the founder of\nWIST (Women In Surgical Training).\nShe regards the discrepancy of female\nsurgeons as a \u201cblip in history\u201d \u2013 with a\nhuge interest in the history of medicine,\nshe described the historical depictions\nof women performing surgery from Ancient Greece and Mesopotamia to the\nMiddle Ages; the first main objection\nand challenge that women faced in surgery was Henry VIII\u2019s flat refusal to allow\nwomen to be surgeons, \u201cno carpenter,\nsmith, weaver or woman shall ever practice surgery.\u201d From this point onwards,\nwomen battled to be allowed to perform\nsurgery. Only in 1910 did the Royal College of Surgeons change their entrance\ncriteria, finally allowing women to take\nthe MRCS exams; in 1911 the first woman was admitted \u2013 the centenary of this\nevent is to be celebrated next year.\nBoth Miss Cope and Prof Mansfield\nagreed that work ought to be fulfilling,\nproviding either men or women with\nsomething that they enjoy. Surgery is not\nsimply a career choice, but something\nthat both find a hugely important part of\ntheir lives. Miss Cope urged female medical students not to apologise for enjoying work \u2013 truly enjoying your career only\nenhances the experience of life.\nSaskia Verhagen\nExplosion risk rumoured to be cause\nof spray-fabric lab closure\nNeed a job?\nIn March 2011, the Office of National Statistics will\nbe carrying out a national census of the population\nliving in England and Wales. As a result they are targeting students for an estimated 35,000 jobs across\nEngland and Wales. This includes 9,000 jobs in the\nEast and South East of England as well as an additional 6,000 jobs in London. The census, which currently occurs every ten years, will create a range of\ntemporary jobs including census coordinators, census collectors and special enumerators. Hourly wages range from \u00a37.41 to \u00a310.42 for census collector\nfor example. Only UK Nationals, Commonwealth citi-zens, Nationals of the European Economic Area and\nSwiss or Turkish nationals are eligible. Go to census-jobs.co.uk for more information.\nAn explosion risk is rumoured to be the cause\nof Prof Paul Luckham\u2019s Chemical Engineering laboratory closure in October. The laboratory was being used to test an innovative\n\u201cspray-on-clothing\u201d developed in conjunction\nwith Dr Manel Torres. Scientists think the fab-ric, created through careful use of an aerosol,\ncould have explosive applications not only in\nhigh fashion but in medicine and industry. The\nspray contains short fibres that are mixed with\npolymers and into a solvent, allowing it to be\nsprayed from a can. The texture of the fabric\ncan be varied by using wool, linen or acrylic\nfibres. The fabric, which dries when it meets\nthe skin, is very cold when it is sprayed on, a\nlimitation that may frustrate hopes for spray-on\nunderpants.\nA spokesperson for Imperial stated at the\ntime that \u201cOn Monday 11 October 2010, the\nCollege\u2019s Safety Director carried out a routine inspection of lab 433 in the Department of\nChemical Engineering and Chemical Technology. During the inspection, the Safety Director\nfound that a fume cupboard in the lab needed\ncleaning, and that the regulator on a gas cylinder needed replacing. As part of the College\u2019s\nhealth and safety protocol, the laboratory was\nclosed to enable staff to carry out repairs.\u201d\nHowever, an anonymous source has informed Felix that the spray contains a highly\nflammable substance called dimethylether. It\nis rumoured that the faulty fume cupboards\nresulted in a build-up of highly flammable va-pours in the laboratory, resulting in a significant explosion risk.\nFelix obtained a test can of the spray used for\nthe \u201cScience in Style Fashion Show\u201d that took\nplace in the Business School earlier in September. The can is labelled as \u201cSpray for Testing\nCharles Betts\n1st Edition\u201d. A warning on the can states that\nthe contents are \u201cextremely flammable\u201d and \u201ca\nsource of ignition\u201d. When questioned on the\nmatter, Prof Luckham declined to comment\nand advised Felix to contact the Imperial Press\nOffice. The Press Office stated that their original statement remains unchanged, and would\nneither confirm nor deny whether there was an\nexplosion risk in the laboratory.\nIs it just me, or does the mottled paint thing look absolutely terrible?\nCaroline Prew/Imperial College London\nLord Winston lighting the Menorah with Chabad\nSouth Ken director, Rabbi Mendy Loewenthal\n\n"

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX\n20\nPolitics Editors: Hassan Joudi, Rory Fenton\nJames Lees, Rajat Jain\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nEdited by Kenneth Lee\nHaiti\nPalestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas says that the\nMiddle East peace talks are in crisis following Israel\u2019s refusal to stop building settlements on occupied land. President Abbas\u2019 comments come hours\nafter the United States formally suspended its demand for a settlement freeze in the occupied West\nBank, admitting that its efforts have come to nothing.\nA settlement ban was one of the conditions set by\nthe Palestinians for direct talks and Mr Abbas has\nsuspended direct talks in September following the\nexpiry of a settlement ban. Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are now due in Washington for direct talks\nbut it is not clear whether the Palestinians will attend.\nPalestine\nProtests erupted around the Haitian capital Tuesday night after an election council announced a\nrunoff between a Ms Aligat, the former first lady,\nand Mr Celestin who is allied with Haiti\u2019s increasingly unpopular Government. Protesters around\nPort au Prince have threatened to set Haiti on fire\nand called President\nPreval a thief, after\npop star Mr Martelly\nnarrowly failed to garner enough votes to\nenter the presidential run-off. The UN\nhas described the\nvoting irregularities as more serious than previously\nthought and the opposition has demanded that the\nresults be annulled and a new vote be held. Haiti is\ncurrently in the midst of a cholera epidemic and is\nstruggling to recover from the disastrous earthquake\nin January last year.\nIvory Coast\nIvory Coast has been suspended from the Economic Community of West Africa, as African states join\nthe UN and Western states to call on President\nGbagbo to cede power, after Ivory Coast\u2019s disputed\nPresidential election. Opposition leader Ouattara\nhas been declared the winner of the presidential\nelection by the Election Commission but was overruled by the Constitutional Court, which annulled\nhalf a million votes in Mr Ouattara\u2019s stronghold in\nthe north. The political impasse has heightened\nfears that Ivory Coast could descend into unrest and\nbloodshed, and comes after the Liberian President\nwarned its former rebel fighters not to get involved in\nIvory Coast\u2019s internal conflict. Ivory Coast supplies a\nmajor portion of the world\u2019s cocoa and is still recovering from a civil war which ended in 2002.\nFriday 10 december 2010\nThis year will be the toughest year for the eurozone ever. Since the financial crisis in 2008,\nthe US and Europe have suffered from a serious recession. In fact, the PIIGS (Portugal,\nIreland, Italy, Greece and Spain), especially\nGreece and Ireland, are now at the fiscal brink,\nand they have called for a bailout from the EU\nand the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nNow we, the Europeans, should consider\nwhy they face debt woes and what the best solution to this problem is. Essentially, the European debt problem lies in the fatal defect of\nthe eurozone, that is, only the European Central bank(ECB) can issue euros in that region.\nIn other words, each country which joined the\neurozone cannot print banknotes. Therefore, if\na nation in that area accumulates large governmental debt by issuing governmental bonds,\nthe country cannnot discharge it by printing\nmoney. Such a separation of fiscal policy with\nfinancial policy is the fundamental problem\nwhich overshadows the eurozone.\nUnlike the eurozone, the UK can print money and pay the debt whenever it wants to do.\nGeorge Irvin, a columnist of Guardian.co.uk,\nsays \u201cEvery schoolboy knows (or should\nknow) that government cannot \u201cgo broke\u201d like\na private business. As long as Britain has its\nown currency, it has the power to print money.\u201d\nThen some readers may worry about inflation\nafter quantitative easing, but basically inflation\nmeans not only expansion of monetary base\nbut also an increase in income level, that, is a\nrecovery from recession.\nThe other major problem regarding the present euro system is that some countries in the\neurozone cannot have the benefit of devalua-Printing to pay debt\nTomokazu Miyamoto\nThis Tuesday, Imperial\u2019s Political Philosophy\nSociety (PPS) hosted an event about the future\nof Iraq, with a special focus on what might happen after the planned U.S. troop withdrawal by\nthe end of next year. Special guest speaker was\nProfessor Charles Tripp, Professor of Politics\nat the School of Oriental and African Studies\n(SOAS), bestselling author and one of the leading Iraq-experts in the UK.\nAccording to Professor Tripp, although next\nyear might be marked by a military withdrawal of the U.S. from Iraq, the U.S. would very\nlikely still continue to remain highly involved\nin Iraq\u2019s various other sectors. He spent time\ndealing with matters relating to each of the\nthree respective population groups in Iraq \u2013 the\nShiites, Sunnis and Kurds.\nAttention was paid also to the main troubled\nareas within the country, including Mosul and\nKirkuk in the north, and Najaf in the middle\npart of Iraq. Professor Tripp referred to the\nforeign influence amongst others. He emphasized that Iran is the only country which has\nbenefited from the situation in neighbouring\nIraq \u2013 with its former arch-enemy Saddam\nHussain removed from power and a Shiite-led\ncoalition now installed in the country\u2019s gov-ernment.\nInterestingly, or even rather worryingly,\ntroubled oil-rich city of Kirkuk as \u2018Iraq\u2019s Jerusalem\u2019. The majority of the city is comprised\nof Kurds. The Kurds indeed regard it to be\ndemographically, geographically and historically part of Kurdistan.\nProfessor Tripp discussed various decisive\nfactors shaping up the future of the trouble-stricken nation, which includes oil, Kurdish\nfederalism or even independence and Iranian\nThe US likely to remain in Iraq\nRaz Jabary\ntion. In general, a country increases its supply\nof money by printing banknotes, the value of\nthem decreases, compared with that of other\ncountries. Such a devaluation makes the country competitive in terms of export, but unfortunately the eurosystem doesn\u2019t permit this.\nIn the 1990\u2019s, Ireland\u2019s current account balance was in surplus, but since the country\nlaunched the euro currency in 1999, it has\nbeen in deficit. In particular, during the year of\nthe US financial crisis, the figure worsened to\n-5.5% of GDP. The country lost the advantage\nof exchange rate in terms of export because it\njoined the euro zone.\nThe same holds true for other eurozone na-tions. Prof. Paul Krugman, the Nobel economics prize winner in 2008, says \u201cIf Spain still had\nits old currency, the peseta, it could remedy that\nproblem quickly through devaluation \u2014 by,\nsay, reducing the value of a peseta by 20 percent\nagainst other European currencies.\u201d If Spain re-adopted the peseta, it could expand its monetary\nbase to the extent that it wants to, which would\nlead to a recovery of export. Iceland, whose\nbanks went bankrupt in 2008, has a little better\neconomic situation than Ireland does.\nEven though the change of GDP in Iceland\nis slightly worse than that of Ireland, the employment of the former is better. Unlike Ireland, Iceland decided to let foreign lenders to\nits runaway banks pay bad private debts, rather\nthan putting its own taxpayers on the line to\nguarantee the debts.\nAs the IMF notes approvingly, \u201cprivate sector bankruptcies have led to a marked decline\nin external debt.\u201d In addition, Iceland has also\nbenefited from the fact that it still has its own\ncurrency; devaluation of Iceland krona, which\nhas made the nation\u2019s exports more competi-tive, has been an important factor in limiting\nthe depth of Iceland\u2019s slump.\nEven though George Osborne, the chancellor\nof the exchequer, claims that Britain is close\nto bankruptcy, UK\u2019s debt problem is different\nfrom that of PIIGS, and UK citizens need not\nworry about the nation\u2019s deficit.\n\u201cIran is the only country\nwhich has benefitted\u201d\nProfessor Tripp phrased the term \u2018civil war\u2019\nwhen referring to the time of intense fighting\nbetween Iraq\u2019s Sunni and Shiite populations a\nfew years ago.\nFinally, on top of the academic views with\nwhich he reflected upon the main aspects of\nIraq\u2019s probabilistic future, Professor Tripp\nbriefly reflected back upon his meeting with\nformer Prime Minister Tony Blair in November 2002, a few months before the start of the\nIraq war.\nDuring that meeting, Professor Tripp had emphasized to the Prime Minister a possibly un-welcoming outcome on the ground in Iraq. \u2018But\nhe seemed to take no notice of what I or my colleagues had to say\u2019, Professor Tripp remarked.\nDuring the Q&A session following the lec-ture, Professor Tripp interestingly remarked\nabout the Chilcot inquiry, in which the former\nBritish Prime Minister once cancelled a book\nsigning in London because he had been \u2018too\nafraid to get arrested by civilian law enforcement\u2019.\nSome borrowers can print their own money to pay their debts\n\n"

After weeks\nof seemingly endless student protests,\nvicious exchanges across the House of\nCommons and many uneasy grumbles\nfrom within the Liberal Democrats, the\nGovernment\u2019s proposal to raise the tuition fee cap passed through the House\nof Commons late Thursday afternoon,\nwith 323 votes for versus 302 against\nUnder the terms of the proposal, the\ncap on tuition fees for home and EU\nstudents (currently standing at \u00a33,290)\nwill be almost trebled, to \u00a39,000. This\nincrease is, the Government claims, necessary in order to balance university finances and develop a \u201cfairer\u201d system of\nfunding. Numerous critics have hit back,\nhowever, arguing that the increase will\nonly be used to offset the cuts in public\nhigher education funding \u2013 a massive\n80% in some subjects.\nMuch of the anger has been directed\ntowards the Liberal Democrats, who,\nprior to the election (in a move that\nhas come back time and again to haunt\nthem) pledged to abolish university fees\nentirely. Now enjoying the dubious pleasures of coalition rule, the party finds itself in support of a proposal that both its\nMPs and its supporters (many of them\nstudents) find fundamentally repellent.\nBeing the junior partner in the Coalition, the Lib Dems have already had to\nmake many concessions \u2013 fiscal auster-ity, defence spending and immigration\npolicy are but a few. All these \u2013 though\nmarginally watered down from the Tory\nhard-line \u2013 nevertheless ran contrary to\nthe Liberal Democrats\u2019 values. But for\nmost of the party\u2019s MPs it was a price\nworth paying for their first position of\npower in living memory. However, rolling back on their promise to abolish fees\nseemed like a step too far. Thousands of\nstudents who supported the party in the\nlast election took to the streets, expressing an indignant sense of betrayal. In the\nface of this, Nick Clegg stood resolutely\n(though not altogether cheerfully) by the\nCoalition\u2019s plans. But many in his party\nwere not convinced. A number of back-bench MPs said that they would abstain\nfrom the vote; a few rebels even threatened to vote against, contravening the\nrules of the Coalition Agreement.\nIn the end, for better or for worse, the\nrebels were capitulated. The Coalition\u2019s\nsubstantial majority in the House of\nCommons meant that those abstaining\nor opposing were not significant enough\nto overcome the collective will. The motion passed with a majority of twenty-one; perhaps a narrower margin of victory then the Government expected, but\na victory all the same.\nAmongst the protestors marching\non Whitehall for a fourth consecutive\nweek, the sentiment was less amicable.\nAlthough the result came as no surprise,\nit is bound to stoke further anger. It remains to be seen whether the relentless\nwave of student protests, that has of late\nengulfed that nation like wildfire, will\nburn on or fizz out.\nNavid Nabijou\nJan Piotrowski\n\n"

By Chris Richardson\nChristmas holiday in the sun\nY\nou may recall from is-sues-past a tale of spiked\ndrinks that occurred on\nKoh Phi Phi in Thailand,\nbut last time I didn\u2019t really dwell on it as a place. It\u2019s a truly\nunmissable spot that offers beautiful\nsands and world class diving as well as\na whole heap of other activities. Up until the devastating tsunami of 2004 Phi\nPhi was a haven, for backpackers and\ntourists alike, as the perfect Christmas\nresting spot, and thankfully people are\nstarting to revisit the area over the holiday season. While the natural disaster\nobliterated the landscape and cost the\nlives of many, it allowed for a tasteful\nfresh start for an island that was well on\nthe way of being permanently tarnished\nby reckless tourism.\nWhilst certainly a clich\u00e9 (I\u2019m sure\nthings are a clich\u00e9 for a good reason,\nmind) Alex Garland\u2019s The Beach is truly\na masterpiece appreciated by travellers\nthe world over. While the mythical island\nis located on Thailand\u2019s Eastern Gulf,\nthe glossy Hollywood screen adaptation\nwas in fact filmed on Phi Phi over on the\nWest coast. One frankly fantastic company (Spider Monkey Travel \u2013 look them\nup if you go) currently offer a camping\ntrip to Phi Phi Leh, the smaller undeveloped Phi Phi island, where The Beach\nwas filmed. I stumbled upon this while\nasking some backpackers for recommen-dations: it shot its way into my top three\nexperiences in Southeast Asia and I\u2019ve\nbeen recommending it ever since.\nThe camping trip kicked off with an\noptional thrill-seeking afternoon, starting with cliff jumping. The islands are\ncomposed of gargantuan limestone\ncliffs, there for your climbing pleasure.\nFollowing some probably-dangerous\nclimbing you can then plunge into the\nturquoise ocean below, to be nibbled by\nfish and stung by the jellyfish waiting to\ngreet you. The adrenaline from throwing yourself from over twenty metres\nis quite something (though the painful\nbum left me suffering for some time af-terwards).\nNext came the shark snorkelling,\nwhich is a lot less daunting than it\nsounds: the area is home to some harmless reef sharks as well as a plethora of\ncorals and species of fish that\u2019ll keep\nyou well entertained for days. Following a light lunch we were all exhausted\nbut so excited to stand in awe at one of\nthe most beautiful spots in the world,\nMaya Bay.\nAfter a short swim to the island that\ninvolved huge waves slamming us into\nrocks and people losing shoes, we clambered our way through the jungle in\nhaste. As my girlfriend had come out\nto join me I was set on this being a relaxed part of my trip, a break from the\nsweating and trekking, and we couldn\u2019t\nhave picked a better place. Perfect white\nsand, turquoise waters and sunny blue\nskies: paradise.\nI\u2019d strongly advise against visiting\nduring the day, as to do so would do\nthe place no justice whatsoever. As we\nshowed up later in the afternoon, hundreds of tourists were being booted off\n\u2013 and I mean hundreds. Thankfully strict\npolicies mean that said tourists didn\u2019t\nleave any litter behind, and we had a\nflawless island for just a handful of us\nfor an entire evening. It\u2019d be upsetting\nto have to share it with the speedos and\nsexpats instead of just a few soon-to-be\nclose friends.\nI think a lot of the time, the travelling\nexperiences you recall with the greatest\nsomeone from a familiar remote village\nback home. As always the circumstances lead to fast-paced friendship forming\nwhich made the evening so much more\nfun.\nWe had a barbecue, sat and drank beers\nand talked, before the evening picked up\nand turned into more of a party with fire\ntricks and great music on the agenda.\nA definite highlight was the obligatory\nskinny dip in the phosphorescent water:\nhardly as magical as DiCaprio\u2019s mo-ment, what with the Scotsmen belting\n\u201cthis is Sparta!\u201d at the top of their lungs.\nAnyway, the partying was great fun, and\nthe lack of a resident law enforcement\nwas certainly taken advantage of.\nSometimes you need activities to\nkeep you entertained, but the atmosphere of this place spoke for itself, and\nwe didn\u2019t really need anything but good\ncompany (if that). I really envy the Thai\nguys there, who definitely have one of\nthe greatest jobs ever. I\u2019d quite happily\nbe paid to improve my fire stick skills,\nplay some acoustic guitar and get drunk\nwith travellers in such an awesome spot:\nremind me why I\u2019m doing a degree?\nThe good times continued well into the\nnight before we retired on bamboo mats\non the beach after tiring ourselves out\nfrom karaoke and catching crabs. Waking up in such an environment was quite\nsomething. As the tourists arrived we\npacked up camp and headed back to Phi\nPhi Don.\nFor some reason we decided that\none night we\u2019d abandon our perfectly\nadequate room for a bamboo shack on\nthe other (party) side of the island, not\nthen equating the excessive noise and\nthin walls to the lack of sleep that obviously followed. Several times I almost\ndozed off, only to be rudely kept awake\nby the likes of the Black Eyed Peas. I\nwalked right past a shoe shop, smiling\nat the shoemaker on my merry way, only\nto find that the pharmacy was empty.\nSeconds later the shoe man popped up\nbehind the counter as he buttoned up\nhis slick lab coat. The Thais truly are a\nmultitalented people: perhaps we could\nlearn a thing or two. Taking full advantage of Thailand\u2019s liberal over-the-counter policy I invested in some 10p\ndiazepam pills, popped a few, and within\nthirty minutes was out like a light without any problems.\nBefore getting my drink spiked (see\nfelixonline.co.uk) the days that preceded\nwith newly found friends were great fun.\nThe island has the usual funky markets\nwith all sorts of cool crafts, great quality\nstreet food at low prices, and the sights\natop the viewpoint are incredible and\nwell worth the climb. The island also has\na fruit shake vendor (who I now have on\nFacebook \u2013 praise be Zuckerberg) that\nI\u2019d rate over any other on the continent.\nHilarity can be found every evening at\nthe Reggae Bar, where anybody inebriated enough can enter the ring and give\nMuay Thai a go: I decided that I\u2019d give\nit a miss since I\u2019m more of a lover (read:\npussy).\nI don\u2019t really get all of the hype surrounding white Christmases: for those\nwho stick around in England it\u2019s just\nguaranteed disappointment, and unless\nyou\u2019re going to ski abroad what\u2019s the\npoint in being confined to the dim-lit\ncoldness? I for one would much rather\nbe in a place like Phi Phi, enjoying the\nglistening heat with a frosty beer and\nbook in hand and not a care in the world.\nfondness are heavily dependent on the\ncompany kept. Hannah and I met some\nreally great people that night, including\n\u201cIt shot its way into\nmy top three experiences in Southeast\nAsia and I\u2019ve been\nrecommending it ever\nsince\u201d\nJust another island, but at least it\u2019s not London\nThis exact photo with varying ugly faces gets taken every day \u2013 get some fucking originality\nSex on the beach: without the cocktail, with your mum\n\n"

Two sections are being deleted,\nleading to 14 (15%) of the academic staff\nbeing made redundant, plus a few more\nearly retirements. This will lead to a 25%\nloss in teaching time across Biology and\nBiochemistry Degrees as well as Masters\nCourses.

Do you even HAVE any friends?\nIf you answered YES to these questions then\nREAD ON.\nWith the Christmas season approaching, it\u2019s\ntime to start looking for presents, and why\nwaste time wrapping boxes when you could\nuse Steam to deliver your expensive (or possibly not so expensive) gifts to your friends?\nFor the unenlightened, Steam, created by\nValve Corporation (makers of Half Life, Team\nFortress 2, Left 4 Dead and Portal), is a digital\ndistribution software platform allowing electronic distribution of games and media. Currently there are over 1,200 games available on\nSteam from small titles by small independent\ndevelopers to mainstream titles by the video\ngaming giants such as Bethesda and Activision.\nAlso offered is a social networking service,\nmultiple language support, automatic game\nupdates, anti-cheat systems, and... well look\nfolks, it\u2019s just a beast, take it from me. If you\ngame on the PC and haven\u2019t downloaded it, do\nit now. I\u2019ll wait for you, I promise.\nSteam also offers a gifting service. When you\ngo to make a purchase, it offers you the chance\nto gift the game to a friend instead (who has to\nbe registered on Steam in order to receive the\ngame). Once the purchase is made your friend\ncan log on and download the game immediate-ly, and they don\u2019t have to waste time throwing\naway gift-wrap. And don\u2019t worry, your friend\nis told who gifted them the game, and can read\nany kind, funny or hideously obnoxious message you attached with it.\nIf Steam isn\u2019t quite your style, why not try\nGOG.com? Good Old Games is another online\ngame service much like Steam which focuses\nit\u2019s attention instead on the golden oldies. With\nover 240 titles under its belt it may be worth\nlooking into if you prefer the older class of PC\ngames. GOG is DRM-free and also offers a\ngifting service, much like Steam, where you are\ngiven an option to gift instead of buy a game\nfor yourself. Your friend receives an email containing a virtual gift certificate and by going to\nthe site they can \u2018open\u2019their present \u2013 provided\nthey have an account,of course, but setting one\nup is quick and easy and is something most Imperial students are likely capable of.

It\u2019s over-the-top crazy\nzombie slaying, and it\u2019s fun as hell.\nThere\u2019s a completely ridiculous plot tied to\nthe game, but considering everything else\nthat occurs in the DR2 universe it doesn\u2019t\nfeel out of place. With multiple weapons\nand decisions to make and take, Dead Rising 2 offers a heck of a lot of replayability.\nThere have been some pretty fine games\nthat I\u2019ve played this year (mostly when I\nought to have been revising), but I think the\ntitle of top game must go to Dead Rising\n2. Why? Because it doesn\u2019t take itself se-riously, that\u2019s why. It\u2019s off the wall. And in\na world where video games try so hard to\ntake themselves seriously, Dead Rising 2 is\nlike a breath of crisp mountain air.\nIt lets you create a whole host of crazy\nweapons, and lets you utilize just about any-Laurence Pope picks Dead Rising 2\nnew types of online games also bring an\ninteresting twist to the online games; the\nGun Game consists of advancing weapons\nachieving a kill with each, starting with a pistol and ending with a ballistic knife. These\nnew types of game means the game no longer just consists of running around shooting\nand stabbing at the first thing you see, but\nactually require you to think and take your\ntime. And if I must mention single player \u2013\nwell at least it has an interesting story.\nWell, it had to be didn\u2019t it? It\u2019s true that\nthere is not much new or original material\nbrought to this game but it\u2019s always the\nmultiplayer that brings this series home. It\nis easy to spend vast amounts of time playing Black Ops, or indeed any of the more recent CoDs, as long as you can play online.\nThe variety in weapons, perks, and kill-streaks allow you to create any style of soldier you want \u2013 and also leads to a huge\namount of challenges to be completed. The\nSean Harbison picks Call Of Duty: Black Ops\nsults were never the same. After a while\nit became almost obscene how well we\nknew the levels and how strategic our play\nbecame. So refined was our knowledge of\nEmerald Hill Zone that all other flatmates\nwere effectively disqualified from ever even\ntrying; for them it became just a spectator\nsport of Sonic, speed, swearing and more\nlast minute changes of fate than ebay.\nSome games don\u2019t age. Sonic 2 is one\nof them.\nMy choice is not because of some trendy\nretro elitism, but one of necessity. I don\u2019t\nhave a modern console. I don\u2019t play COD. I\ndon\u2019t play FIFA. I don\u2019t care.\nBecause Sonic 2 has proved more than\nable to satisfy our flat\u2019s multiplayer fix. Every day for months, my flatmate and I sat\ndown to play Sonic 2. He was always Tails.\nI was always Sonic. He always used the official controller, whilst I used The Other One.\nAside from those fundamentals, the re-Omar Hafeez-Bore picks...

There\u2019s more to do, more to look\nat and more to solve.

Although some puzzles can be solved by pot\nluck, most require genuine thought. There\nare some real stumpers and a few I\u2019m still\nyet to solve.

Go to the Puzzles section >>\nH\naving read the Formula\n1 review in Issue 1474,\nI found several points\nI completely disagree\nwith.\nFirstly, team orders. I believe that\nFerrari were completely correct to ask\nMassa to move over and allow Alonso\nthrough. At that point in the season, both\ndrivers were a long way behind the Red\nBulls and the McLarens, so focussing\non the Alonso, the higher scoring and\ngenerally faster driver was the only sensible option. Although team orders are\nofficially banned, this was a pointless\nknee\u2013jerk reaction to Ferrari abusing\nthem in Austria in 2002, where Michael\nSchumacher was miles ahead of anyone\nand there was no need to swap positions\nto gain him an extra 4 points for victory.\nSince the ban, there have been several\ntimes when team orders have been used\nand no one has battered an eyelid. For\nexample, at the Chinese Grand Prix in\n2008, Kimi Raikkonen allowed Felipe\nMassa pass him. No one made a fuss\nabout this because it was the end of the\nseason and the team were giving their\nlead driver the best possible chance of\nwinning. No different to Germany this\nyear then, except it occurred earlier in\nthe season.\nTeam orders have always been a part\nof the sport. In fact, in 1956, Ferrari\ndriver stopped to let his team mate Juan\nManuel Fangio take over his car in order to win the championship despite the\nfact that Moss also had a chance to win.\nTo put that in perspective, it would be\nlike Sebastian Vettel letting Mark Webber take over his car in Abu Dhabi, had\nAlonso got himself into a championship\nwinning position. From the examples I\nhave given, you might think that team\norders are unfair as only Ferrari use\nthem. Not true. For example, in 1998,\nDavid Coulthard was ordered to move\nover to allow Mika Hakkinen to win\nthe Australian Grand Prix. Furthermore,\nin last week\u2019s Abu Dhabi Grand Prix,\nMark Webber found it awfully easy to\novertake fellow Red Bull family driver\nJaime Alguersuari considering that\nMassa spent the entire rest of the race\nstuck behind him. So, to conclude, team\norders have their place in Formula 1,\ncan you confirm you understood that\nmessage?\nMoving on, the new teams. Far from\nbeing \u2018unpleasant boils\u2019, I think they\nhave done an excellent job this season\nand proved how tough Formula 1 is.\nFirst of all, Lotus: They were only\ngiven the go ahead to enter in late September 2009, meaning that their car had\na gestation period of less than 6 months.\nWith that in mind, being as close to the\npace and as reliable as they were in the\nearly part of the season was a remarkable achievement. OK, they didn\u2019t gain\nany ground on the other teams after the\nseason start, but given the development\nrate in Formula 1 and the fact that Lotus\ndecided half way through the season to\nconcentrate on next year\u2019s car, this is not\nunexpected. I\u2019m not going to get into the\nname argument here as it\u2019s the longest,\ndullest and most confusing conflict you\nwill ever read about, but given how the\nteam has performed this year and how\nthey have the blessing of Colin Chapman\u2019s son Clive, who heads Classic\nTeam Lotus, I think they are fully deserving of the name.\nVirgin Racing, a combination of successful sportscar designer Wirth Research and multiple Formula 3 championship winners Manor Motorsport also\nmanaged a solid effort. Yes, the fuel\ntank mistake was embarrassing, but it\nwas the result of an inexperienced team\npushing the limits of then unconfirmed\nregulations and was quickly sorted once\ndiscovered. The team experienced reliability problems in the early part of the\nseason, but nothing worse than Sauber,\nwhose car was designed with the benefits of significant funding from BMW.\nHRT: ok, I\u2019ll give you that, they were\npretty rubbish, but considering their\nbudget for the entire year was around\n38 pence, the fact that they started every\nrace is pretty commendable. HRT were\nusing chassis designed by Dallara, who\nare the dominant constructor in several\nsub-F1 race series, again proving that\neven for the best, Formula 1 is difficult\nto succeed in.\nStill, could be worse: USF1, the fourth\naccepted entry managed no more than\nseveral million press releases, resulting\nin a surprisingly accurate parody, which\nrevolved around the idea that the team\nspent all of their time building toasters\ninstead of cars.\nSo, to summarise the new teams, I believe they have all done a very good job\nthis year, considering their comparatively low budgets, inexperience at the top\nlevel and the short period between the\nacceptance of their entries and the first\nrace, in which they had to design and\nbuild their cars from scratch.\n1 2 3 4 4 5 6 7 8\n9 10\n11 9\n12 13\n11 12 14 13\n15 17\n15 16 17\n18 18\n19 20 19\n21 22\n22 23 23\n24 25\n24\n26 27\nAcross\n1.

I\nwas a BioChem undergraduate at Imperial and let me say this, Dr Jane Saffell\nand Prof. Yuri Ushkaryov\u2019s final year\nmodules are irreplaceable. Their teaching was fantastic and I bet Jane knows\nthe name of every student in her classes.\nWhat stage of your PhD are you at?\nI technically started in September in the\ndivision of Cell and Molecular Biology\nbut actually I started in January at the\nformer Institute of Biomedical Engineering (IBE) which shut down over the\nsummer. My supervisor there went to\nNewcastle but I couldn\u2019t follow him so\ntherefore I changed supervisor to Prof.\nYuri Ushkaryov.\nSo you will have to change supervisor\nfor a 2nd time less than a year into\nyour PhD?\nYes. When I started with Yuri I was\naware of the restructuring but I was\nconstantly re-assured that my research\nwould fit into the new department and\nthat my supervisor also fits but strangely\nnow it seems that\u2019s not the case.\nWhat are your options?\nWell officially, there\u2019s nothing happening until January and then I\u2019ll have\nuntil July to do, whatever, who knows.\nThere\u2019s no-one else in the U.K. who has\nthe necessary expertise to supervise my\nPhD effectively. I have to find a supervisor who is willing to experiment. Yuri\nwas the only person after the move from\nthe IBE who was willing to help me to\ndo the research that I want to do. I\u2019m\npaying money for this, I don\u2019t want to\ndo a different area of research. I want\nto do the research that I\u2019m interested\nin. If Yuri finds a position elsewhere I\nwould go with him. Not only because of\nthe expertise but also because I am getting tired of the way Imperial College is\ntreating its staff and students.\nHow do you feel about the process?\nI just got an email saying that some\npeople had been affected.

However students have queried whether this teaching can be delivered at the same high\nquality. Many of the lecturers made\nredundant actually developed and convened a course that specifically matches their field of expertise. Of course,\nothers can teach the course but will this\nachieve the \u201cmore research-active approach to teaching\u201d that the department\nclaims to be striving for, if they are not\nactive researchers on the material that\nthey are teaching?\nAdditionally, the loss of academics\nwho have each dedicated huge amounts\nof time to teaching has sent the wrong\nsignals about the value of, say, Emeritus\nProfessor John Mansfield and Dr Pietro\nSpanu.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 10 december 2010 33\nARTS\nChristina Flanagan\nProbably muscled out by many of the 355 clubs\nand societies available to you at Imperial, Musical Theatre Society wasn\u2019t one that was at the\nforefront of my consciousness. Not doubt as\nyou will see, they were busy observing Freshers\u2019 Fayre than partaking in it. Consequently,\nin my ignorance, when the assignment crashed\ninto my inbox, I was left more bemused at the\ntask than excited. Music? Theatre? Imperial?\nSurely a lethal mix?\nBut a brave few have dared to experiment,\nand a little to my surprise and much to my\ngladness, their results are astounding. Imperial Collage is this term\u2019s offering from MTSoc, a musical revue made up of one part\ndistilled essence of Imperial, one part ingenious lyrics and one part catchy show tunes.\nThe brainchild of Gilead Amit, someone who\nhimself embodies a little bit of what it is to\nbe Imperial, it is \u201clargely based on all the\nanecdotes I\u2019ve picked up over my three years\nhere.\u201d Well, clearly Mr. Amit is a very busy\nman, either that or highly efficient; the quan-tity, density and detail of references to Imperial\u2019s eccentricities and idiosyncrasies are the\nkind of thing Herodotus would have dreamt\nof. Touching on the plight of Nobel-prize assisting research assistants in search of recognition and professorial caffeine-addiction, the\nrevue really does cover all bases of Imperial,\ninto several dimensions, even capped off with\na cameo from Robert Winston.\nThe plot is set loosely around the unraveling\nof a Freshers\u2019 Fayre, where things escalate after the Light Arm\u2019s Society misplaces a weapon \u2013 imagine that to music. Along the way we\nmeet the entire ensemble cast of IC, carried\nall the while with cleverly re-written songs,\nthe tunes of which anyone will recognize. The\ncontinuing feud between news website Live\nand newspaper Felix (we thank you again for\nyour readership), the maniacal rector and his\nfiling cabinet driving range, the stresses of being Union President and the strains of doing a\nPhD. in Aeronautics are all recounted in songs,\nthe breadth of which is astounding. Highlights include great adaptations from Westside\nStory and Avenue Q, along with the Pirates of\nPenzance and Les Mis, giving us a glimpse of\nour own Tonies, Marias, Fantines and even\nMajor Generals at Imperial.\nThe whole production is done without a\nsingle iota of pretension, MTSoc does everything with gusto and a sense of humour.\nAnd in Imperial Collage, they have a revue\nthat is deep, polished and, strangely at times,\nvery perspicacious. Many a true word is said\nin jest, and there\u2019s certainly a few sung to a\ntune in Collage \u2013 those wanting a little insight\ninto the university\u2019s workings would do well\nto give this a watch. And for us on the inside,\nthrough a combination of delicately layered\nand emotionally engaging plot, unceasingly\nwell-pitched humour and acute observation,\nit\u2019s sure to tap into an Imperial part of all of\nus.\nWill Prince\nImperial Collage\nThe Dark Side\nEnd of term theatrics at the Union\nTwo plays before Monday, but what sort of AmDram are you letting yourself in for?\nI guarantee you\u2019ve never seen a play like The\nDark Side before. Knitting, murder, star-crossed lovers... this show has it all. The actors of Imperial\u2019s Dramsoc are on their usual\noutstanding form, and as always I absolutely\nloved watching them, but that\u2019s only the Light\nSide of the play. This play is really all about\nDramsoc\u2019s Dark Side (ie. the techies: sets,\nlighting, sound and so much more) and as such\nallows them free reign to play with loads of\ncool stuff and make some terrifyingly loud\nbangs.\nWhat I enjoyed most about the play is how\nit explores the illusions of the theatre \u2013 how\ngood acting and some fantastic effects can get\ninside our heads and make us believe things\nthat are beyond all reason or logic. Co-director and author Shamini Bundell\u2019s intention is\nto break the so called fourth wall separating\nher audience from the play and to really make\nus think about how the theatre actually works.\nTo this end the actors talk directly to us, serenade us and even partly dismantle their own\nstage at one point, pulling us right inside their\nworld.\nThe plot, centred on Imperial\u2019s own KnitSock, is a little tenuous at times and certain\nmoments are bordering on silly, but if you accept that this is a comedy and approach it in a\nlight-hearted spirit there are plenty of laughs.\nSome of the theatrical and sci-fi references\nmight have made more sense to the cast than\nto me but I thought Mike Lewis\u2019s socially\ninept romantic lead Josh was very funny and\nsurprisingly winning and I especially loved the\nFacebook gags. Shamini\u2019s little adaptations of\nShakespeare throughout are really witty! Although, inevitably, some Imperial stereotypes\nare drawn on it definitely stays the amusing\nside of cringy, and I would like to voice a special appreciation of the Union Bar set which\nshould leave you gagging for a drink in the\ninterval!\nHelen Poulson is in her first year with\nDramsoc and I thought she was brilliantly cast\nas Anna, a bemused and frustrated outsider to\nthis bizarre theatrical world. Her acting is very\nexpressive and she totally and completely got\nme on side. The play cleverly highlights her\nlack of identity as the \u201cnormal\u201d one trapped in\na very abnormal situation where nobody else\nseems to care about the odd mysterious death\nor two.\nIt could take a little while to relax into the\nmelodrama but the actors do some great dying and I love the idea of a play within a play\nwithin a play. Thankfully, The Dark Side stays\nthe clever side of confusing. I have no idea\nhow Shamini\u2019s imagination produced this crazy mix but it somehow works and is perfectly\nexecuted.\nI had the privilege of seeing this play at a\npoint where the real Dark Side were still perfecting their role and they thoroughly deserve\nthis tribute to their tremendously hard behind-the-scenes work.\nFriday/Saturday Sunday/Monday\nDramsoc\u2019s The Dark Side in rehearsal, they\u2019d been putting the set together with strong glue\n\n"

A small proportion of\nits profits are invested back into research, enabling\nproductive projects to fund themselves. It also helps\nto form and incubate spin off companies that stem\nfrom Imperial College research and developments.\nNeedless to say, research at Imperial is highly use-ful. Within the past year there have been 344 new\ninventions and 48 patents filed through Innovations,\nsome of which have been greatly profitable for the\nuniversity. The molecular drug, Respivert Limited,\nmanaged to raise \u00a39.5 million in profit through sales\nlast year. As a total, \u00a3211 million has been raised\nby developments since 2006, \u00a349.7 million of which\nhas been reinvested by Innovations.\nAlthough Innovations specializes in business and\ninvestment, raising \u00a3140 million in 2 years is no\neasy task. The company intends to raise it through\nthe sale of several million new shares to current investors in rights and warrant issues. Initial sales in\nare predicted to raise \u00a355 million in January 2011\nand a further \u00a374 million by January 2013. Further\ncontributions will be made from the sale of other\nshares to new investors. The company has had a\ngood track record so far, raising \u00a314 million for Imperial last year and over \u00a320 million in previous years\nwithout having to undergo rights issues since 2005.\nAlthough Innovations declare the main aim of the\nfunds to be to increase the size of investments in\nspin off companies, only 40% will go towards this.\nThe remaining 60% will fund collaborations between\nInnovations and other technological development\ncompanies and spin offs. \u201cThe funds will also enable us to make investments in companies founded\nby or based on technologies from the universities of\nOxford and Cambridge and University College.\u201d Martin Knight, chairman of Imperial Innovations, stated.\nAlthough collaboration may reduce the influence that\nImperial has over Innovations, the rector, Sir Keith O\nNions, welcomes the association with other universi-ties, believing that it may lead to more joint research\nprojects in the near future.\nUnfortunately, the \u00a356 million intended for Imperial is only for Imperial\u2019s associated spin off companies and areas of research already in the Innovations\npipeline, so isn\u2019t accessible to other academic re-searchers.\nZainab Ali\nW\nhen will Imperial march?\u2019\nwas the question Felix\nasked last week. Government cuts to higher education and tuition fees of\nup to \u00a39,000 had failed to bring out the inner\nrevolutionary in the average Imperial student.\nWhat then would it take to inflame passions on\ncampus? The answer arrived with a flurry of\nleaves on Wednesday, as hundreds of students\ntook the Life Sciences department to account\nover what they see as the unjustified and unjustifiable cuts being made to what is, as the\ndepartment itself admits, \u2018one of the largest life\nscience groups in Europe\u2019.\nThe first signs of trouble came on Imperial\nCollege Union\u2019s Facebook page where the ominous status \u201cearly indications of the outcome\nof the Life Sciences restructure show that Plant\nSciences is no more\u201d was posted on Friday 2\nDecember. Details of the cuts quickly spread\non Facebook (Julian Assange would be proud)\nand a chain reaction of outrage spread through\nstatuses across the Imperial network. A campaign quickly followed as the Union organised a public meeting to discuss the cuts that\nthe Head of the Life Sciences Department Ian\nOwens and Head of Faculty Maggie Dallman\nbravely agreed to attend. In a textbook example\nof crowd-sourcing, a protest was suggested.\nDefiant students would take the Plant Sciences\nCuts straight to the College by dumping toma-toes, trees, leaves, twigs and all things \u2018plant\u2019\noutside the Blue Cube. The activism doesn\u2019t\nend there however, with an online petition also\nbeing organized, making claims of \u2018faulty data\nanalysis and lack of evidence\u2019. Over 1100 signatures had been collected by the time of print-ing. Additionally so many people had planned\nto attend the public meeting (nearly 500) that\nan extra lecture theatre in the Sir Alexander\nFleming building was booked to handle the\noverflow. With Facebook overrun by the red\nmonkey of revolution (Viva La Evolucion!),\nthere was a sense, on the eve of the showdown\nwith the department, that something big was\nhappening.\nBoth lecture theatres were packed. Students\nand staff crowded the aisles and sat on the floor,\neager to hear what was to be said and to have\ntheir grievances aired and addressed. Taking\nthe floor were Head of Department Ian Owens\nand Maggie Dallman, Principal of the Faculty\nof Natural Sciences. Professor Owens began\nproceedings by seeking to clarify the issue, ostensibly through the use of Powerpoint, though\nthe slides were occasionally at the mercy of a\nfervent potted plant near the projector. Stressing that the \u201crestructure is still an ongoing process\u201d, Owens outlined two keys aims that he\nImperial finally awake\nhoped would be achieved through the process,\nthat of improving the department\u2019s competitiveness both nationally and internationally and\nto reduce the department\u2019s \u00a31.5 million deficit.\nStating the reasoning behind the cuts, he declared that, \u201ca couple of the groups are unlikely\nto improve to the level we required until we\ntook drastic action\u201d. Students grew more and\nmore restless as the hour drew on, with discontented chatting and a bored malaise blanketing the room. Professor Maggie Dallman was\nsure to move quickly through her speech as she\nsought to make the audience aware that the cuts\nwere felt at every level, stating that she is \u201cnot\nsome faceless administrator\u201d. She emphasised\nmentioned the \u201cuncertainty\u201d of the situation\nand the challenge that they have faced in making the decisions.\nQuestions were then invited from an eager\naudience. Hands shot up as PhD students demanded assurances about funding and recent\ngraduates expressed their disgust at the loss of\nsome of their best-loved lecturers. Ian Owens\nwas sympathetic to the students, agreeing that\nthe staff lost were great teachers but taking\npains to emphasise that the decision was motivated by financial troubles. He tried to reassure\nthe students that the department would come\nout of the restructure stronger, and continue to\nprovide excellent teaching even though he admitted that \u201closing good teachers is difficult to\ncope with\u201d.\nBut at other points he was clearly on shakier\nterritory. One student attacked Owens in response to his assurances that the department\ncould survive. Said student provided the ri-poste, \u201cI pay for an excellent degree, not to\n\u2018survive\u2019.\u201d Passions grew as students refused\nto accept answers that they saw as slippery,\ncalling out to Owens when they felt he had\navoided a question. Repetitive answers began\nto anger the audience, with Owens frequently\nbringing up the \u201cuncertainty\u201d of the whole situation and repeating that he would not be able\nto comment on the cases of individual staff\nuntil January. The disgruntled audience were\nloath to wait and pressed him but he refused to\ncomment further on specific courses, insisting\nthat he had said all that he could.\nGreat cheers and rounds of whooping spread\nthrough the room as some questioners took the\nopportunity to skewer the Head of Department;\nNormally silent\nstudents find\ntheir voice. By\nMatthew Colvin\n\u201cBoth lecture theatres\nwere packed. Students\nand staff crowded the\naisles and sat on the\nfloor, eager to air their\ngrievances\u201d\nA 3rd year biochemist holds up a poster showing the symbol of the protests, the \u201cViva La Evoluc\nAfonso Campos\n\n"

Unless otherwise specified,\nyou\u2019re going to need the Adobe Flash Player plug-in\nwhich can be installed from http://get.adobe.com/\nflashplayer/.\nCat Astro Phi\nphotonstorm.com/games/cat-astro-phi\nIt has a cute kitty. It has spaceships. Is there really\nany more you need to know? This top-down shooting game, played in a Gameboy window that should\nsend waves of nostalgia over anyone born in the 80s,\nfeatures a tiny space man out to save his cat and\nescape the hostile planets on which he inevitably\ncrash lands.\nAsteroid-infested space flights sandwhich each level\nand provide a fun distraction that inevitably sees your\nship crash. You must navigate the helmeted spaceman around the robot-infested planets, upgrading\nyour guns, shooting baddies and collecting keycards\nand cells to power your ship. The robots actually provide some challenge and their speedy moves will frequently get the better of you.\n42\nA\nfter having your mind completely blown by Assassin\u2019s\nCreed II\u2019s preposterous ending,\nBrotherhood returns to connect\nthe dots in the bizarre tale and\nexplain what exactly is going on. But in doing\nso, does it bring any new and redeeming features to expand the series and is it worth it as a\ngame in its own right?\nAt the core of the game remain the missions.\nThese usually relate to tailing a target, scaling\nmonstrous buildings to find an item, or \u2013 of\ncourse \u2013 assassinations. Unfortunately, as is\nalmost expected, the missions really haven\u2019t\nchanged. It\u2019s easy to see how the game is almost exactly the same as Assassin\u2019s Creed II,\nmerely with different scenery. Understandably\nit is difficult to design new features into such\na winning formula, however, as with the previous games it\u2019s easy to get bored by the re-petitiveness of such quests. On the other hand,\na good new feature is the \u2018100% Synchronisation\u2019 goal. This gives you a challenge to complete within the quest \u2013 for example you may\nhave to kill only your target or finish the mission in a certain amount of time. This makes\nthe missions a lot more interesting, but it can be\na bit disappointing to know you\u2019ve completed\nthe mission and not achieved the challenge,\nand thus have only achieved \u201850% synchronisation\u2019.\nThe game takes place in Rome, which is now\nunder the rule of the Borgia family, who are associated with the Templars and at war with the\nAssassins. They have a vendetta against Ezio\n(the main character) who must work his way\nup, gaining a team in order to take down this\nfamily and their tyrannous rule of the city. The\ncity is split up into twelve sections, each overlooked by a so-called \u2018Borgia tower\u2019. In order\nto restore Rome to its previous glory, Ezio must\nenter these towers, assassinate the captains and\nthen burn down the towers. This allows you to\nthen purchase the shops nearby and also open\nsecret tunnels \u2013 a new quicker way of moving around the city. By doing this you access\nnew equipment to unlock and also increase the\nincome of money, much like improving Monteriggioni did in the previous game. The towers\ndo not have to be destroyed but it makes doing\nmissions in that area a lot easier \u2013 and it\u2019s also\na lot of fun.\nDestroying the towers also makes way for a\nnew concept; buying assassins guilds. These\nnew guilds allow you to train assassins that join\nyour team. This is certainly a very cool feature\nand is very entertaining, but it really detracts\nfrom the difficulty of the game. All you have to\ndo is press a button and a team of six assassins\njump in and kill all the guards near you, meaning you have to do nothing at all. This really\nis a bit of a double-edged blade in all honesty\nfor, as amusing as it is watching your assassins\nfly in from nowhere and destroy your enemies,\nout them noticing you gain a lot more points\nthan just running after them and alerting everyone to your presence. Wanted and Advanced\nWanted are free-for-alls with there being a few\ntweaks in the rules for Advanced Wanted. For\nexample, the tracking device is far less accurate\nmaking you have to look out for tell tale signs\nbefore deciding whom to assassinate in order\nnot to accidentally kill a civilian. Manhunt consists of two teams of four assassins where one\nteam hides whilst the other hunts. Teams gain\nmore points for working together, as a team\nthat is hiding close together will gain far more\npoints than a team spread out across the map.\nFinally, Alliance pits four teams of two assassins against one another which again relies\nheavily on the team working together to track\ndown their targets and again rewards those who\nwork together.\nIn conclusion I would say that Assassin\u2019s\nCreed: Brotherhood really is not that big a step\nup from the previous game. The gameplay is\nmuch the same, and if you\u2019ve played the previous games it really doesn\u2019t make much of a\nnew impression. For newcomers to the series,\nthis is a great start with both beautiful looks\nand missions that for the first few tries remain\nentertaining. The multiplayer is a great addition\nto the series and brings a much needed rejuve-nation.\nHowever, it alone does not prevent the sad\nfact that this game isn\u2019t quite as revolutionary\nas it\u2019s predecessors. If I were to be honest, I\nwould tell you to wait until this game comes\ndown in price and start on the multiplayer, as\nthis is easily the greatest part of the game, but\nalone it\u2019s not worth paying full price for.\nAssassin\u2019s Creed: Brotherhood is available now for Xbox 360 and PS3, and will\nbe available on PC in early 2011.\nWorld Conquest\nfacebook.com/worldconquest\nIt\u2019s RISK, but on Facebook! The classic world domination strategy game is recreated in pixel-perfect detail\nfor you to play with your friends and/or strangers. Set\nup a private game and invite your friends for some\nclassic turn-based action \u2013 just remember, take Asia!\nit really is like an infinite get-out-of-jail-free\ncard. This is especially true when you consider\nthat combat has never been difficult in this se-ries.\nCombat is once again dominated by long\ntimes of waiting for opponent attacks to simply\npress one button and counter and kill them im-mediately, with a few exceptions (including the\nnew Borgia captains). This quickly becomes\nrepetitive and really offers no challenge, with\nthe only redeeming feature being the new combo animations \u2013 why just stab someone when\nyou can also shoot them? It\u2019s impossible not to\nenjoy the amusing scenes that show off your\nentire armoury.\nSean Harbison builds his Assassin\u2019s Creed: Brotherhood\n\u201cAs amusing as it is\nwatching assassins fly in\nfrom nowhere, it really is\nan infinite get-out-of-jail-free card.\u201d\nThe newest and perhaps greatest feature by\nfar of this game, is the multiplayer. There are\nfour modes of play for multiplayer; Wanted,\nAdvanced Wanted, Manhunt and Alliance.\nThese are all variations on the central idea\nof hunting down a target whilst avoiding being hunted down, the trick being that there\nare many \u2018civilian\u2019 NPCs who look identical\nto your target. Killing these people will not\nget you points and will lose you your target.\nThere is also a points system for the style of\nkill which really benefits true assassins, as by\nremaining stealthy and killing your target with-\n"

    "content": "A\nll too often I am\nconfronted by pretentious atheists\nwho are equally as\nintolerable as their\nreligious fundamentalist counter-parts: with The God Delusion as\ntheir Bible in hand these obnoxious babbling idiots often think\nthey\u2019re superior and fail to acknowledge their own hypocrisy.\nSaid types of people are usually the first to complain at any other socalled festive holiday as a marketing scam employed by those evil corporations to force you into consumption of cards and other tacky crap, but\nmake an exception for December 25th. Sure, the unity of the family and\nexchange of gifts is all fine and dandy, but the same crude Valentine\u2019s\nDay logic can also apply here \u2013 shouldn\u2019t such acts be spontaneous and\nnot confined to a single day on the calendar? Or are you otherwise too\nunimaginative to conjure up something for yourself?\nYes, oh-so enlightened atheists, we\u2019re aware that December 25th is\na date heinously stolen by those vandals to eliminate traces of a Roman solar holiday. While the date may be of pagan origin and thus not\nChristian, I\u2019d like to remind you that you\u2019re in fact not a pagan either: by\nparticipating in this date hijacking you\u2019re simply stooping to the level of\nthe thieves. Simply having an awareness of the pagan roots isn\u2019t a reason\nto celebrate, unless of course you have a soft spot for Roman sun gods.\nGood old Dicky Dawkins, naturally, has a lot to say on the subject,\nincessantly rambling that Atheism simply takes it \u201cone god further\u201d, and\nthat in a way all Christians are atheists because they reject notions of\nZeus, Thor and so on.\nEqually we have to ask why atheists select only Christian holidays for\ntheir repertoire: are festivities from other religions not also worthy periods of sharing the love within your family? Or perhaps it\u2019s because of\nour \u2018culture\u2019, whatever that means. It\u2019s thanks to dim-witted disposable\nanswers like \u2018culture\u2019 that things ranging from the abuse of children to\nevidence-based drugs policies get too easily overlooked.\nTied in neatly with \u2018culture\u2019 is this idea of tradition: we should celebrate Christmas because that is how it\u2019s always been in this glorious\ncountry. I don\u2019t think that I really have to point out (or perhaps I do) that\nthis is in direct violation of the free-thinking fundamentals of secular-ism. If we stuck with this attitude of conservatism in other walks of life\nwe\u2019d be in an incredibly dreary society: such old traditions ought to be\ntossed away if we\u2019re really concerned about a forward-moving zeitgeist.\nGo ahead and abandon it, stop giving them further reason to incorrectly\nbrand us a Christian nation.\n26 felix\nFRIDAY 10 December 2010\nCOMMENT\nC omment Editor: Anna Perman\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nC\nhristmas is traditionally a time of celebration but it has recently\nbecome quite a controversial holiday. I\noften hear people complaining about\nus losing touch with its traditional\nvalues and extolling us to \u201ckeep\nChrist in Christmas\u201d.\nI don\u2019t see much sense in this at-titude. While this is a Christian holiday there is no reason why atheists or people from other religions can\u2019t\nget something out of it too. While it almost certainly has greater significance and meaning for believers I don\u2019t particularly think that you need\nreligion to take away this holiday\u2019s message of joy and goodwill. This is\nespecially evident in how good Christmas is at bringing people together.\nGathering all your relatives around a single table can improve family\ncohesion, whether you believe in the story of Jesus\u2019 birth or not.\nIt seems strange that so many Christians object to others celebrating\nthis holiday when it is widely suspected that Christmas itself borrowed\nmuch from ancient pagan celebrations. Early Christians managed to take\ntraditions that originated with beliefs that were completely alien to theirs\nand still turn them into something meaningful. Non-Christians can do\nthe same today.\nI always get very annoyed when people complain about things like\nputting up decorations too early, and the commercialisation of Christmas. I might not agree with these things but, since they don\u2019t interfere\nin the way I chose to celebrate I don\u2019t see why I should make a fuss.\nI think that the most important principle of our society is that people\nshould be free to do whatever they want as long as they don\u2019t hurt\nothers.\nThose who do speak out are also very often hypocritical. I doubt that\nall those who are so vocal about the importance of religion in Christmas\nspend the whole of the 25th December in prayer and contemplation instead of partying with friends. They\u2019ve accepted some secular aspects of\nthe holiday so I find it strange that they should dislike those who accept\na few more.\nSuch attitudes are doing far more harm than good. A few dissenters\nwon\u2019t stop others celebrating this holiday as they best see fit. Instead,\nthese irrational arguments add unnecessary tension to this festive period\nand take away from its peaceful message.\nThis was taken to extremes last year when a number of shops in Leeds\nwere threatened and vandalised after they started selling Christmas cards\nin August.\nEverybody would be happier if we just let each other be.\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t\nkind acts be\nspontaneous and\nnot confined to a\nsingle day?\u201d\nChris Richardson\n\u201cA few dissenters\nwon\u2019t stop others\ncelebrating this\nholiday as they\nsee fit\u201d\nIf tube lines had a\nChristmas party...\nMaciej Matuszewski\nYou know that friend of yours who\u2019s always\nbusy on weekends when you ask her to\ncome out? She recently left a relationship\nthat was just going round and round. Welcome to the Circle Line.\nIt takes this guy ages to get anywhere,\nsometimes going nowhere at all and just\nstanding idly at the queue in the Post Office while everyone behind him just gets an-noyed. To be honest he just wants to die\nwith dignity but his fucking doctors won\u2019t\ngive up on him. It\u2019s not your time just yet,\nDistrict Line.\nBut this guy\u2019s the real alpha male: fast and\nstrong, and women literally throw themselves at him. Those who do get to bed\nthis stud will be disappointed, though: he\u2019s\nalways coming in a couple of minutes. It\u2019s\nnot all sunshine and roses for the Piccadilly Line. The Central Line and the previous\ncustomer are always trying to one-up each\nother, which sometimes results in a bit of a\nstare-off when they cross paths at Holborn.\nThis all leaves the Hammersmith and City\nline rather disgruntled. How would you feel\nif you were rendered obsolete by a cripple\nand a geriatric?\nNonetheless, whizzing past one another and\nspending all night at the depots together\nthey are all pretty close, and they often arrange get-togethers, often BYOB (Bring Your\nOwn Brakes) parties. This time they chose\nto chill at Hammersmith where they all meet,\napart from the Central Line that is. He never\ncould make Fridays anyway, on account of\nwork the following day. So, many laughs\nwere had as the WD-40 flowed and sparks\nflew, but something wasn\u2019t right. District\nwas feeling unusually down today and left\nearly, soon after P Dilly who couldn\u2019t stay up\nall night like the others, leaving the girls by\nthemselves. That was soon interrupted by a\nknock on the door: the boyfriend. H&C, who\nlives with Circle, knew where this was heading and promptly told him to get derailed but\nCircle told her to shut up and invited him in.\nH&C was having none of it and disappeared\ninto her room to drown her sorrows and the\nsound of make-up sex.\nThe following morning...\n\u201cThere are severe delays on the Piccadilly\nLine due to the District Line falling under a\ntrain earlier and minor delays to the Hammersmith and City Line owing to about\nthree bottles of tequila the night before.\nThe District Line has finally been put out of\nits misery and been replaced by a series of\nrail replacement buses. There is no Central\nLine service today due to excessive gloat-ing. There is a good service running on all\nother London Underground lines.\u201d\nVeli Akiner\nChristmas is nearly upon us, and\nAtheists and Christians alike can\u2019t wait to\ncelebrate.The question is...\nIS CHRISTMAS JUST FOR\nCHRISTIANS?\n\n"

This is\npartly because of the limited scope of\nproducts in which the banks can be in-volved. Instruments like Collateralised\nDebt Obligations (CDOs), which suffered abysmally during the crisis, were\nmostly absent from the balance sheets of\ninstitutions abiding to Islamic financial\nprinciples.\nWhile they did not underperform as\nseverely, it must be noted that in economic booms, there is also less scope\nto take advantage of this trend. The response to economic stimulus is notably\nmore tempered and tepid. The International Monetary Fund does suggest that\nthis view is somewhat simplistic and\nthat it does not reflect the fact that Islamic Finance institutions do not have\na great ability to share risk given their\ninability to engage in products that may\nhelp spread it around more easily.\nWhat does the future hold for Islamic\nFinance?\nWhile only 1% of the world\u2019s financial\ntransactions are guided by Islamic prin-ciples, this is growing fast at a rate of\n15-20% a year. Interestingly, not only\nMuslims are taking interest in this form\nof finance. Many non-Muslims, especially in Malaysia, are finding that this\nway of doing business fits in nicely with\ntheir morals and ethics.As a result, many\nglobal banks such as HSBC and Citi are\noffering Sharia-compliant accounts for\nanyone interested. It would not be surprising to see this growth rate increase\nsignificantly in the coming years as Islamic Finance finds ways to mimic more\nof the conventional offerings of banks.\nT\nhe only function of economic forecasting is to\nmake astrology look respectable\u201d said Ezra Solomon. For more funny\nlines from ivory tower economists, the\nfantastic \u2018Freakonomics\u2019 and \u2018Superfreakonomics\u2019 books by Steven Levitt\nand Stephen Dubner (both \u00a35.30 from\nAmazon, \u00a37,99 for kindle) show the\npower of economics in real world situ-ations. With chapter titles such as \u201cWhy\nare Street Prostitutes like Department\nStore Santas,\u201d you can be sure it\u2019s very\nirreverent in tone. They\u2019re written for a\ngeneral, wide audience and are delightful introduction books to the field of\neconomics in general.\nAnother brilliant book for beginners is \u2018The Ascent of Money\u2019 by Niall\nFerguson (\u00a35.69) that came out to accompany an equally brilliant television\nseries of the same name. Ferguson is a\nprofessor of history at Harvard, and his\nbook describes the history of money\nfrom the ancient Middle East, through\nto gold rushes, to the new world in the\nlate medieval ages, the mighty renaissance power houses of Italy, and right\nup to the fascinating story of Long\nTerm Capital Management and then the\nbig bad Credit Crunch. Furthermore it\nalso offers beginners-guide level explanations to bonds, shares and monetary\ntheory, and does so well enough to be\nuseful as a reference (I always forget\nwhat bond yields are) The TV series is\neasy to find online for either streaming\nor downloading, and makes for brilliant\nviewing.\n\u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 (\u00a38.49, \u00a39.99 on\nIslamic Banking institutions are becoming ever more prominent in the\nWest, serving the needs of Muslims and non-Muslims alike\n\u201cIt is forbidden to\nspeculate wildly in\nthe financial markets\nwith overly leveraged\ninstruments\u201d\nK i n -dle) is a\nbook of\nWar and\nPeace prop o r t i o n s ,\nin fact if\nyou own a\nKindle, this is\nprobably the\ntime to use it.\nCharting the e n t i r e\nCredit Crunch beginning with the aftermath of the fire sale of Bear Stearns, it\ntells the entire saga of Lehman Brothers\u2019 ungainly toppling over, Merrill\nLynch\u2019s sale to Bank of America, the\nnear explosion of AIG and the international response from governments\nand regulators, focusing mainly on the\nNew York Fed and the Treasury. Written by the New York Times financial\ncolumnist Andrew Ross Sorkin, the\nforeword claims to have been written\noff the back of over 500 hours of interviews with over 200 people close to\nthe events, and it certainly feels like it.\nPaced like any good thriller, this expansive novel of an historic account\nreally keeps you turning the pages,\nalthough frequently back to the\nfront of the book where there is an 8\npage list of characters. Personalities really shine through this story, although\nas it\u2019s about investment bankers who\nmanaged to drive huge companies into\nthe ground, the personalities are usually those of total dickheads. The biggest\ndick of all, Dick Fuld Jr, the CEO of\nLehman at the time of the bankruptcy\nis especially good to laugh at as it all\ncomes crashing down. There is clearly\nsome artistic license used in\nthis book, especially in the\nsetting of the scene, but the\ncomprehensive lists of notes\nand sources makes sure that it\ndoesn\u2019t get too into the flight of\nfiction. If that doesn\u2019t convince\nyou, it even has some pictures,\nincluding a photocopy of the absolutely ridiculous cheque for $9\nbillion written by Mitsubishi UFJ\nto Morgan Stanley. If they ever\nmake Credit Crunch: The Movie,\nthis book would be a good place to\nstart for the script.\nRecently re-issued in light of the\nCredit Crunch and following age of\nausterity \u2018When Money Dies\u2019 (\u00a36.88)\nby Adam Fergusson originally published in 1975, is an historic account\nof the hyperinflation experienced in\nWeimar Germany. If you\u2019ve been reading this article thinking for Christmas\npresent ideas, don\u2019t be put off by the\ngrim subject, this book has a totally\nsweet cover that makes it a cool present\nanyway. Fergusson strikes the tone just\nright in describing the sheer destruction wrought on the population without\nover doing it and becoming hysterical,\nas well as providing criticisms of the\npoliticians in charge at the time without\nbeing too ideological. In a time when\nwe once again find countries with colossal sovereign debts and widespread\nangst and anger at government cuts,\nthis book serves as an excellent reminder why we have to turn the printing presses off.\n\n"

Presenting\nthe most spectacular locations for New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations\nAn explosive end to 2010\nHamburg, Germany\nThe alcoholic younger sister of the Scandinavian nations, there\u2019s no\nescape from entering the New Year without at least a mild attempt\nat intoxication. For the connoisseurs Copenhagen\u2019s latest status as\none of world\u2019s most renowned destination of Michelin-starred dining will no doubt lure in the hungry pack. For the more animalis-tic party-goers I recommend the Cirkusbygningen, the old circus\nbuilding set to host the largest single party in town. The best fireworks will hover over the beautiful Tivoli Gardens for five nights in\na row prior to New Year\u2019s Eve.\nThe gorgeous Belgian city is by no means medieval when it comes\ndown to New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations. Against the archaically-architectural backdrop, some of the coolest rave fests in Belgium\ntake place in Antwerp; for the little-more civilised bunch the sheer\nthought of Belgian beer should entice you to visit a few pubs and\nkeep your pint-count high. Come minutes before midnight and follow the trail of celebrants down to the quays of the river Scheldt \u2013\nbe in awe of the explosions of fireworks. Polish it off with your first\nbeer/champagne in 2011.\nThe marvellous, yet seemingly-reserved city reveals its true, fun-seeking\nnature on New Year\u2019s Eve. Whilst Altona accommodates for the older\naudience that seek a quieter and more mature celebration, energy and\nvigour is what keep other districts\u2019 flow running \u2013 areas around Reeperbahn and Schanzenviertel bring out the party spirit and celebratory\nbooze-age. The fireworks at the Elbe is a spectacle, though it\u2019s the streets\nwhere the displays are at \u2013 fireworks are available for purchase in super-markets. Load your trolleys with gunpowder and ignite some rockets in\nyour neighbourhood.\nPrague, Czech Republic\nCopenhagen, Denmark\nEdinburgh\u2019s Hogmanay \u2013 is there a better way to spend New Year\u2019s\nEve than this? One of the UK\u2019s best festivals takes place in the heart\nof Edinburgh. Opening this year\u2019s event is the torchlight proces-sion, before the celebrants toss away their candles and burst into\nparty mode in the City Centre at the official Street Party. Elsewhere,\nWest Princes Street Gardens play host to concerts featuring some\nof the hippest artists on the UK music scene. All to be wrapped up\nby breathtaking fireworks, holding hands with your beloved and\n\u2018Auld Lang Syne\u2019.\nEdinburgh, Scotland\nAntwerp, Belgium\nThe Czechs have an extra reason to celebrate 1 January than you\nthink: the Czech Republic was established on this day in 1993 following the breakup of Czechoslovakia. Not one but several public\nfirework displays erupt at midnight. The popular methods of celebration include a bar crawl and fine dining at all-inclusive restaurants offering food, drinks and dancing. And then there\u2019s the Party\nBoat, which cruises along the river Vltava \u2013 sightseeing aside, the\nitinerary is timed with precision to allow patrons the opportunity to\ncatch the fireworks at a prime location.\nYou may strip away the Icelanders\u2019 finance but you still won\u2019t dampen\ntheir party spirits \u2013 and it shines through during those long dark nights of\ntheirs. Their New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations seem to occur in reverse: the\nevening itself is revered in solemnity before the fireworks, best viewed\nfrom the highest spot of the city, Hallgrimskirkja, announce the commencing of New Year festivity. Parties unveil on every street and live\nmusic emanates from every bar until as late as 5am. And there\u2019s no stopping you from prolonging the famed party spirit well into the first day\nof 2011.\nReykjavik, Iceland\n\n"

Imperial students, you\u2019re now in the nexus\nof the UK\u2019s cocktail scene, just down\nthe road from the Savoy hotel where\n\u2018The Savoy Cocktail Book\u2019 was first\ncompiled in 1930. If you\u2019re sitting on a\ntrust fund from Daddy that could have\nbailed out Iceland, then this is the place\nto be. However if like us your recession-frayed purse strings are tightening slowly around your neck, read on to enjoy\ncocktails on the cheap.\nThe cocktail is reputed to have been\ninvented in New Orleans in 1794 by Antoine Peychaud, a pharmacist by trade,\nas a tonic for his customers. The word is\nderived from \u201ccoquetier\u201d, the French for\negg cup, which is the means still used\nto measure cocktail ingredients. History\nshows us mixology has its roots in science and should therefore come naturally to us Imperial students (with the obvious exception of geologists who can\u2019t\neven mix a snakebite). The temperature\nof your spirit is key to the quintessential\ncocktail. Gin, vodka and rum is served\nice cold as the chill reduces tongue sensitivity to sweet and sourness and enhances dryness, whereas good whisky\nmust be served at room temperature to\nallow the complex aromatics to evaporate and diffuse through the palate.\nSo now we have whetted your appe-tite, where are you going to go? Luckily we\u2019ve done all the hard work for you\nand have paid the price in cirrhosis and\nhangovers. The Loft in Clapham, an exclusive upstairs urban retreat sells drib-blingly good cocktails and has regular\ntwo for one nights with fantastic views\nof the kebab shop across the road, which\nwill deep fry anything if you ask nicely.\nIf you\u2019re in the mood for Fulham, try\nChateau 6 for a classier/sloanier kind of\nnight. Just lay back on the faux-leather\nChesterfields while being regaled with\nstories of Mr Abercrombie\u2019s gap yah.\nOur personal favourite, Anam Bar in\nAngel, is a little bit further afield but\nwell worth the extra time. Tucked away\ndown Chapel market, this chilled out unpretentious venue does the tastiest cocktails we\u2019ve tried so far. We highly recommend the outrageously quaffable \u2018Dr\nStrangelove\u2019 a smooth mix of Buffalo\nTrace Bourbon with Port, Sak\u00e9 and Tuaca, tickled with caramel. Also topping\nour list is the Chilli \u2018n\u2019 Chocolate, red\nchilli muddled and shaken with Tequila,\ncoffee and butterscotch liqueurs and cocoa powder. Head down on a Thursday\nand get any cocktail for four pounds.\nAs the Imperial bible New Scientist\nrightly said \u201cHumankind has gone to\nalmost absurd lengths to make ethanol\npalatable\u201d but we\u2019ve gone one step further and made them cheap as well. In the\n1790s happy hour began at 3pm so let\u2019s\nraise our glasses to Peychaud and have\na little pick-me-up before final lectures.\nShakin\u2019 your cocktail feather\nLetting your hair down, sippin\u2019 on cocktails by Peter Quicke and Jamie Rickman\nThe Manhattan\nReputed to have been invented\nby Winston Churchill\u2019s mother:\n2 oz rye whiskey\n1/2 oz sweet vermouth\n2-3 dashes Angostura bitters\n1 maraschino cherry to garnish\n\u2022 Pour the ingredients into a\nmixing glass with ice cubes.\n\u2022 Stir well.\n\u2022 Strain into a cocktail glass.\nCocktails etc.\nIn addition to Peter and Jamie\u2019s recommendations, here\nare my alternative locations\nfor awesome cocktails and the\nrecipe for a good night.\nBar Kick\n127 Shoreditch High St,\nLondon E1 6JE\nHappened to come across\nthis place on a Friday night;\nyou can expect Mojitos stinking of rum, challenges to table\nfootball (which, when you lose,\nmeans that both your money\nand reputation is down the\ndrain). Prices are comparable\nto the West End, but the East\nEnd is really where it\u2019s at.\nThe Book Club\n100 Leonard Street EC2A 4RH\nAnother one of the East End\nplaces-to-be, reviewed count-lessly in Felix. Good gigs, ping\npong and good alcohol, need I\nsay more?\nGraphic Bar\n4 Golden Square,\nLondon W1F 9HT\nServing cocktails in paint\npots, there\u2019s no need for the\npretentious little finger in the\nair and grubby fingerprints over\nthe glass. Served according to\nthe colour of gin, share paint\nbuckets for four, but at \u00a325 a\npop.\nNO MISSILES AT ASSA\nAn all authentic Korean food experience.\nBy Chinhua Yap\nA\nssa is a humble little establishment in the Little\nKorea of Soho, a short\nstretch of shops with a\nconspicuously significant numbers of Korean eateries. The\nbest sign of culinary authenticity is the\npresence of actual Koreans in a Korean\nrestaurant and on this front Assa did\namazingly well. The place was bustling\nwith Koreans and it was reassuring to\nsee them tucking into bubbling pots of\nkimchi stews and hearing the sounds of\nthe dolsot bibimbap sizzling away. Seriously though, do you see the Japanese in\nYo-Sushi, or Italians in Pizza Hut?\nThe concept is easy, get to Assa, pray\nthat it is not packed to the doors and\nhopefully, grab a table. Sit down and\nhave your legs awkwardly positioned \u2014\ntouching the legs of your dining mates.\nThe things we go through for food...\nAssa offers great lunch deals. For\nabout \u00a36, you get a main dish and two\nsaucers of banchan (side dishes) with a\nrice tea to wash everything down with.\nI was immediately drawn to the dol-sot bibimbap upon scanning the menu\nthough; the theatrics of a heated stone\npot was good enough impetus. Unglamorously translated into \u201crice with various saut\u00e9ed or raw vegetables topped\nwith an egg (raw, or fried) seasoned\nwith Korean fermented red pepper paste\nserved in a stone pot\u201d. Quite a mouth-ful. Squirt in appropriate amounts of\nslightly spicy pepper paste, burst the\nbeautiful egg yolk and stir it all up. Attempt to coat every grain of rice and every bit of vegetables with the yolk and\nthe pepper paste and enjoy the delightful contrast in flavours and textures. The\ncrunchy vegetable strands and the fluffy\ngrains of white rice all brought together\nby the more-ish and umami-rich ember\nred pepper paste. Those with a slightly\nheartier appetite should consider various\nstir-fried beef or chicken entr\u00e9es served\non top of a generous portion of rice \u2014\nless ostentatious but still delicious.\nWhat stole the show was the Haemul\nPajeon (Korean style seafood pancake).\nAn omelette packed with prawns and\nsquids. The batter was pan-fried to a\ngolden glorious crisp and the soy and\nrice vinegar dipping sauce served as a\nnice little embellishment. Don\u2019t wait,\nthough, devour the pancake asap as the\ncrisp doesn\u2019t last long.\nAssa was equal parts sound, sight and\ntaste. The crackle of the stone pot, the\nsimmering of the fiercely red stews and\nthe genuine tastes left us with a terrific\nexperience. Travel around the world, my\nfriends, with a culinary exploration.\nAssa 53 St Giles High St, Charing\nCross, London WC2H 8LH 020 7240\n8256.\n@Ignissa/flickr\n\n"

Ask for a\nstudent discount and bring your\nImperial ID.\nCash only.\nThe impact on modules and courses\nxplains the reasons for the departmental cuts\nadmitted that some of the staff lost were \u201cfantastic\u201d but said that the changes were driven\nby a need to address the Department\u2019s long\nrunning deficit. In the 2006/07 session, the department was running at a \u00a312 million deficit\nbefore being cut down to \u00a31.1 million last year.\nThe fact that the deficit for the 2010/11 session\nraised for the first time in several years was admitted to have been a major factor behind the\ncurrent decisions.\nIn separate news, the College announced a\n\u201c\u00a3140 million innovation investment boost\u201d\ncaused through floating Imperial Innovation\nGroup plc shares on the stock exchange. Additionally the College ran a \u00a314.5 million surplus in 2009, up from \u00a37.1million in 2008; the\nsurplus is believed to have risen significantly in\n2010. Maggie Dallman rejected the suggestion\nthat the College didn\u2019t spend enough money\non teaching saying \u201cWe have invested more\nmoney in teaching and we don\u2019t just sit on this\nsurplus and do nothing with it\u201d. She pointed to\nthe quality of accommodation and the gym as\nproof and added \u201cyou [students] would complain about poor accommodation\u201d if we diverted that money to teaching.\nPlant Sciences \u2018obliterated\u2019\nThe cuts have been slammed as the end of Plant\nSciences at Imperial, a claim that the department has strenuously denied. 9 out of 20 academics from the former Plant and Microbial\nSciences (PMS) section have been lost while\nthe impact on the now dissolved Cell Biology\nand Functional Genomics (CBFG) section has\nbeen more dramatic; only 4 out of 9 academics\nremain.\nThe method by which the department targeted the sections has come under sustained\nattack. Both the Union and academics in the affected sections have criticized the department\u2019s\nuse of \u201cspectacularly flawed\u201d statistics to prove\nthat the research output of PMS and CBFG is\nlower than other sections. The Union have\nposted data on their website which they claim\nshows that \u201cthere is no difference between research output and that there is a significant difference in teaching hours\u201d. Further criticisms\nwere made in relation to the relocation from\nthe Wye Campus which began in 2004 and\nonly ended this year. In his letter to Ian Owens,\nProfessor John Mansfield said: \u201cThe impact of\nrelocation has not been given adequate weight-ing. [...] To hold the view [that] there was no\nsubstantial disruption is simply an insult. [...]\nThere has simply not been enough time since\nthe relocation to allow the section to develop.\u201d\nIan Owens addressed both the above issues\nwhen he spoke to Felix in October, commenting that he had not seen signs that the section\nwas returning to its previous 5-star research\nrating. In reference to claims of data misuse,\nProfessor Owens declared: \u201cI would not be presenting the data if I did not believe that it was\nstatistically significant.\u201d\nWhile the Department of Life Sciences maintain that their courses\nwill retain the current \u201cdepth and\nbreadth\u201d despite the proposed\nchanges, information has surfaced\nwhich claims that the number of\nstaff involved in teaching is to be\nseverely reduced, including those\nconvening certain courses.\nThe full scale of the impact that\nthe plans will have on teaching in\nBiochemistry have been revealed\nto Felix, with one member of affected staff warning that at least 25%\nof teaching for the entire degree\nprogramme being removed by the\nnext academic year. The majority\nof courses across all three years of\nthe Biochemistry and Biotechnology\nBSc are in line for staff losses.\nOver the first year, all four core\ncourses will suffer significant loss-es. Staff losses stand at 30% for\nMolecular Cell Biology 1, 35% for Biological Chemistry, 40% for Proteins\nand Enzymes and 50% for Molecular\nBiology. The conveners for Biological\nChemistry and Molecular Biology 1\nare also amongst those members of\nstaff affected by the cuts.\nSecond year courses are comparatively less affected, with staff losses\nof 30% for Molecular Biology 2 and\n50% for Molecular Cell Biology 2.\nIMPERIAL AWAKENS: Union leads\nresurgence of student activism PAGE 6\nThe third year of the course is by\nfar the most affected. While staff\nlosses for Mechanisms of Gene Expression and the Biochemistry Final\nYear Project stand at 20%, the figure substantially increases for the\nremaining courses. Biotechnology\nand Business suffers 30% losses.\nThere are losses totaling 80% for\nthe courses Biochemical Pharmacology and Drug Action, Cellular Neuroscience and Molecular Neurobiology, advancing to 85% for Molecular\nBasis of Development and finally\n90% for Advanced Topics in Plant\nMolecular Biology. The conveners of\nthese listed third year courses have\nall been affected by the cuts, apart\nfrom those in Mechanisms of Gene\nExpression and the Biochemistry FInal Year Project.\nThe Department of Life Sciences\ndefended these losses to staff and\nstudents on Wednesday, making\na concerted effort to assure those\nconcerned that the losses are not\nfocused on adversely affecting\nundergraduate teaching, but are\ninstead \u201cexclusively research orientated\u201d. Head of Department Ian\nOwens acknowledged to those in attendance at the group meeting that\n\u201cteaching is incredibly important\u201d.\nIn reference to the effect that\nthe staff losses would have on undergraduate teaching across the\ndepartment in general, Owens explained that, \u201c[Life Sciences] hopes\nto have very few changes this year to\nteaching\u2026 essentially, there will be\nno changes\u201d\nWhen asked by a member of the\naudience whether the staff losses\nmeant that the number of options\navailable to students would be\nhalved, Owens claimed that \u201cthat\u2019s\nnot the case,\u201d instead suggesting\nthat following the changes, the result would be a \u201cmore stimulating,\nmore relevant and better course.\u201d\nMatthew Colvin\nHead of Department Ian Owens\nsays that the cuts to staff will not\naffect teaching, a claim fiercely\ndisputed by students and staff in\nhis department\nStaff Affected\nDr Simon Archer\nDr Gerard Bishop\nDr Robert Coutts\nDr Mahendra\nDeonarain\nDr Bart Feys\nDr Alex Grabov\nDr David Hartley\nDr Richard Murphy\nDr Kevin O\u2019Hare\nDr Glen Powell\nDr Jane Saffell\nDr John Tippins\nDr Yuri Ushkaryov\nDr Rudiger\nWoscholski\nThe Human Cost: Page 8\nEditorial: Page 24\nLetters: Page 27\n\n"

Einstein\u2019s dislike of his\nteachers\u2019 penchant for rote learning was a reflection\nof his love of individual and intellectual freedom,\nchampioning the beliefs the author revisits as he\nrelates his subject\u2019s life and work in the context of\nworld and political events, shaped by WWI and WWII\nand their aftermath through the Cold War. Isaacson\npresents Einstein\u2019s research\u2014his efforts to understand space and time, resulting in four extraordinary\npapers in 1905 that introduced the world to special\nrelativity, and his later work on unified field theory\n\u2014 without equations and for the general reader.\nIsaacson focuses more on Einstein the man: charismatic and passionate, often careless about personal affairs; outspoken and unapologetic about his\nbelief that no one should have to give up personal\nfreedoms to support a state. Essentially, Isaacson\nreminds us why Einstein (1879\u20131955) remains one\nof the most celebrated figures of the 20th century.\nRojin Kiadeh\nFestive science facts\nOne of the better aspects of Christmas is the\nfood. A juicy roast is a must, and the process of\nroasting sets off many chemical reactions that\nfew other methods can match.\nWhatever meat you choose, it is the muscle\ntissue that you will be dying to tuck into. Muscle tissue normally consists of around 75% wa-ter, 20% protein, and 5% fat and carbohydrates.\nIn raw meat, the proteins are coiled and relatively strongly bonded together. The oven acts\nas a thermodynamic reactor and once up to the\nnecessary temperature, specific to the proteins\nin the meat, the bonds break and the proteins\nunravel and denature. This process makes the\nChristmas roast nice and tender.\nBut why does roasted meat taste so good?\nThe answer is in one of the chemical reactions\nthat takes place: the Maillard reaction. Discovered in 1912 by French chemist Louis Camille\nMaillard, this reaction takes place when car-bohydrates, specifically sugar molecules, are\nheated, at roasting temperatures, with amino\nacids.\nMany different compounds are formed as\nthe carbonyl group of the sugar reacts with\nthe amino group of the amino acid to form Nglycosylamine. These undergo Amadori rear-rangement, an important organic isomerisation\nreaction that creates compounds with the same\nmolecular formula but different structures,\nproducing ketosamines. It is this group of molecules that not only produces the rich and delicious flavours we associate with roasted meat,\nbut also the melanoidins which give the roast\nthat golden brown colouring.\nROASTS:\nThe overindulgence at Christmas may damage\nyour health in a rather surprising way. Your\ngenes may be adversely affected by some of\nthe foods traditionally eaten during the festive\nseason.\nDr David Topping of CSIRO, Australia\u2019s\nnational science agency, warns that over consumption of certain nutrients can affect your\nDNA. \u201cThere is a school of thought which says\nthat over nutrition leads to the production of\nmolecular oxygen species that can lead to damage of the DNA,\u201d he says.\nNot only are there general dangers with any\nover consumption, but the traditional bird\nof choice, the turkey, seems to make matters\nworse. This inconspicuous meat is high in dietary protein. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that increasing the\namount of protein will increase genetic damage to cells that line the large bowel,\u201d explains\nTopping.\nHowever, those of us who only like Christmas for the opportunity to gorge ourselves\nwill be glad to hear that you can avoid this\nform of DNA damage by eating a specific dietary polysaccharide: the humble potato. Dr\nTopping says that starch that is not digested\nThe most important thing about Christmas is\nthe brilliant excuse to drink excessively. Sherry\nand mulled wine are the standard beverages but\nany alcoholic drink can lead to unwelcome side\neffects.\nThe hangover, technically known as veisal-gia from the Hungarian word for \u201cafter night of\ntoo much fun you do not want to, and will not\nbe able to remember\u201d (kveis) and the Greek for\n\u201cpain\u201d (algia), is caused by the alcohol in the\nblood blocking the secretion of the hormone\nvasopressin from the pituitary gland.\nWhen the hormone concentration in the\nblood drops, the kidneys send water directly\nto the bladder, acting as a diuretic and preventing the absorption of water. This diuretic effect\nleads to dehydration, which causes problems\nfor the brain.\nAs blood flows through the brain, due to the\nlow concentration of water in the blood, water is drawn out of the brain cells and shrinks\nthe brain, causing it to pull away from the skull\nwhich ultimately causes the headache.\nRoger Highfield, author of Can Reindeer Fly?,\nsuggests that, in order for Santa to deliver the\nhuge number of gifts in time, across the globe,\nhe would have to achieve such high speeds that\nthe forces on his body would be 17,500 times\ngreater than gravity on the surface of the Earth\nand would crush him into a singularity.\nHowever, Roger rightly points out that: \u201cSanta is not dead. He delivers presents every year,\nas reliably as Rudolf\u2019s nose is red.\u201d\nBut why is Rudolf\u2019s nose red? Despite being able to withstand crushing forces, Santa has\nbeen unable to cure the common cold.\nReindeer noses contain elaborate and highly\nconcentrated folded membranes which act as\nheat exchangers. Cold air, when inhaled, is\nrapidly warmed by the blood in the membranes\nas it enters the body. The exhaled, warm air\nis cooled before leaving by the same process.\nThis helps reindeers retain heat and minimise\nmoisture loss.\nHowever, this moist respiratory system\nmakes a wonderful home for parasites and bac-teria, including 20 known so far that are unique\nto reindeer. Odd Halversen of the University of\nOslo has suggested in the journal Parasitology\nToday that the \u201ccelebrated discolouration\u201d of\nRudolph\u2019s nose is probably due to a parasitic\nor bacterial infection of his respiratory system.\nEFFECTS ON GENES:\nin the small intestine can produce protective\ncompounds in the gut that prevent the dam-age.\nHANGOVERS:\nThe traditional real pine tree is slowly being\nreplaced in homes up and down the country by\nfake, plastic Christmas trees. However, there is\none good reason to appreciate the real thing.\nResearchers have isolated a group of anti-inflammatory compounds in the bark of the\nScotch pine, widely used as Christmas trees.\nThe scientists say that these compounds could\nbe developed into drugs to treat pain and ar-thritis.\nThe leader of the research group, chemistry\nprofessor Kalevi Pihlaja from the University of\nTurku in Finland, explains: \u201cThe preliminary\nstudy showed that highly purified preparations\nCHRISTMAS TREES:\nof pine bark extract have potent anti-inflamma-tory effects. In the future, this may mean that\npeople with arthritis may ease their pain by\neating food supplements made from Christmas\ntrees.\nThe researchers found that the compound\nextracted from the pines inhibits nitric oxide\nproduction, an excess of which has been linked\nto arthritis and circulatory problems, and also\ninhibits prostaglandin production, linked to arthritis and pain.\nIf you are suffering from pain or arthritis, it\nis probably still not a good idea to chomp your\nway through your tree.\nREINDEERS AND\nSANTA CLAUS:\nBiology is useful for those \u201cMerry Christmas, you\u2019re adopted!\u201d moments...\nFriday 10 december 2010\n\n"

Most dads would\nprobably be equally happy with either of\nthe pairs below \u2013 both chic, either will definitely do the job of outdoing your sibling\u2019s\nattempt at yet another comedy gift.\nSkinted: Green Tartan Gloves (left) \u2013 \u00a318\nat topman.com \u2013 definitely one for the city\ndad who thinks he\u2019s a country bumpkin,\nthis great pair of gloves with a touch of designer flair.\nMinted: Classic Silk-Lined Gloves \u2013 \u00a365\nat aspinaloflondon.com \u2013 handmade with\nbutter-soft leather, this pair (in tan, brown\nor black) would go down a treat with anyone\u2019s dad.\nPerfume\nOld faithful, but with a little extra thought\nput in. You\u2019ve bought her the same old perfume that you\u2019ve seen on her dressing table year after year \u2013 it\u2019s time for a change.\nDon\u2019t do the standard swap and go for a\nbubble bath or an aromatherapy candle instead (ugh!). Actually go out and sniff out a\nperfume that you think she\u2019d like, and steer\nclear of anything too heavy, and definitely\nstay well away from anything with a celebrity branding\u2026 Eau de Coleen Rooney or\nJennifer Aniston may just give off the wrong\nimpression!\nSkinted: White Musk by The Body Shop\u00a312 at thebodyshop.co.uk \u2013 though incredibly cheap, this is a really lovely, light fra-grance. The only downside is that it doesn\u2019t\nlast as long as a proper perfume.\nMinted: Philosykos by Diptyque (left) \u2013 \u00a345\nat spacenk.co.uk \u2013 a personal favourite,\nthis scent is actually unisex; I just can\u2019t resist its fresh, blossoming scent with touches of fig and green leaves.\nCardigan\nThe single most stylish addition to a man\u2019s\nwardrobe, it is the ultimate combination of\nform and function. Adding a touch of sartorial flair to both a formal and an informal\noutfit, it can be layered under a smart\njacket, proving not only warm but incredibly chic, or over a t-shirt with jeans. The\nbest colours to look for are navy blue, forest green, maroon or grey marl - whatever\ncomplements his existing wardrobe. Make\nsure you buy a skinny-fit cardi \u2013 it makes\nthe most of the male figure, accentuating\nthe waist.\nSkinted: Salt and Pepper Cardigan (left) \u2013\n\u00a324 from topman.com \u2013 a great grey marl\nwool number, this one also comes in navy\nand is incredibly easy to wear \u2013 perfect with\njeans or over a shirt.\nMinted: Broadwindsor Cardigan \u2013 \u00a389\nfrom aubinandwills.com \u2013 definitely one to\nshare, this cardigan from Jack Will\u2019s older\nand rather more chic brother will definitely\nfind its way into your winter wardrobe.\n\n"

Wtf is this wikileaks\nstuff all about?\nPlants? They\u2019re a fairytale!\nI\nn a radical step, Imperial College\nhas broken away from the scientific community to declare that\nplants are actually a figment of\nthe imagination. When questioned\nabout the fact that there were quite obviously a lot of green things about the\nplace, a spokesperson for the college said\nthat they were mainly \u201cEmpty cans of\nbeer, rotten food and Waitrose shopping\nbags\u201d.\nImperial went on to say that since plants\ndon\u2019t exist it would be silly to retain any\nof its plant sciences staff and have sent\nthem a text message telling them to have\ntheir desks cleared out by the end of the\nacademic year. \u201cWe would have spoken\nto them personally but didn\u2019t want to\ncatch their plant believing madness\u201d said\nCollege; it went on to say that \u201caffected\nPhD students would receive a \u00a35 book\ntoken and be sent on their way unless an\nexorcism could be performed to relieve\nthem of their planty-osity\u201d.\nWhen it was pointed out that this move\nwould leave a rather large gap in the\nteaching timetable, College replied that it\nwould \u201cGive students time to learn about\ngreen things that were real like frogs and\nglobal warming. And besides, this isn\u2019t\nprimary school - you\u2019re supposed to be\nteaching yourselves by now \u2013 what do\nyou think Wikipedia is for?\u201d. College\nhad no comment when asked how they\nexpected remaining staff to maintain\ntheir high standards of teaching once\ntheir workload had doubled other than to\nsuggest that maybe students could mark\neach other\u2019s exam scripts.\nAt a staff student meeting one student\nasked \u201cIf plants don\u2019t exist then why does\ncollege pay thousands of pounds a year\nto replace the grass on the Queen\u2019s Lawn\nbefore killing it again by putting a marquee over it?\u201d The reply was \u201cDon\u2019t be\ndaft, of course grass exists \u2013 it\u2019s a symbiosis between a fungus and a photosynthetic bacterium.

This is exactly why\nwe\u2019re not going to bother teaching you\nlot anymore.\u201d Felix found this student in\nthe Union later rocking backwards and\nforwards muttering the word \u201clichens\u201d\nover and over.\nIn an effort to prove to College that\nplants do in fact exist, students have been\nplacing shrubs, flowers and the occasional root vegetable outside the faculty\nbuilding.

Dinner does not promise the same\nspectacular feasts that were featured on Heston\u2019s\nshows, rather, simple contemporary dishes that\ntake their influence from gastronomic recipes dating from the 16th century such as Scallops with Cucumber Ketchup and Peas. With a little work on the\nfood editor front, a possible complementary meal\nreview will appear in January. With 4000 advance\nreservations made on the first morning phone lines\nwere open (1st December) though, the chance of it\nbecoming reality are next to nothing.\nT\nhis week, Felix returns to Fulham\nto review Brasa, the restaurant\nattached to the recently opened\nBroadway Bar & Grill which we\nwrote about a few weeks ago.\nSince our last visit, Brasa has acquired its own\nsign above the door, sending out the \u201cHello\nwe exist!\u201d message to passers-by, although the\nword probably hasn\u2019t spread much yet: it was\nrather quiet on a Friday night when we visited.\nBrasa promises a Mediterranean-style sharing experience centered around quality meat\n(sourced from the UK) which is cooked on an\nAsador grill imported from the Basque country.\nIf steaks are too boring for your palate, there are\nspecialties such as partridge, pheasant, venison\nor halibut. Brasa sounds like the perfect place\nfor successful and beautiful young people (like\nyourself) to catch up on protein and chat with\nequally successful and beautiful friends. You\nwill be served by friendly and beautiful staff, of\ncourse.\nSkipping starters, we went straight to the\npoint: meat. My friend Bea ordered a veal\nchop, and as all the meats at Brasa come pre-cut for sharing, I helped myself to a nice juicy\npiece. My only criticism about the veal was that\nit probably came a bit too cooked, considering\nthat my friend asked for it to be rare-ish. My\nown Galloway fillet was a quality piece of rare-ish fresh meat, but when it\u2019s good meat like\nthis, you can\u2019t go wrong with that. But, excuse\nmy stickler tendencies, I did have beef with it.\nFirstly, it came with a bone. I was puzzled. Is\nthis new? I don\u2019t know about you, but in my little head, fillet stands for boneless. I even called\non the dictionary, just so I wouldn\u2019t make a\nfool of myself, and, indeed, it confirms that fillet stands for \u201ca boneless cut or slice of meat or\nfish\u201d. Secondly, there just wasn\u2019t enough of that\ncow on my plate to justify the price tag. This\nis, after all, Fulham, not Knightsbridge. With\nthese sort of GPS coordinates, one would think\nthat \u00a328 for the meat alone (not including sides)\nwould warrant a Nice Big Piece of Cow. Or\nmaybe it was just too good and I wanted more!\nOur meats both came with a dollop of butter on the side, which is not what you usually\nsee with your steak, but I\u2019m with Julie Powell\non this one: \u201cIs there anything better than but-ter? The day there is a meteorite rushing toward\nEarth and we have thirty days to live, I am going to spend it eating butter.\u201d (In case you for-got, she\u2019s that woman who blogged about her\nyear-long cooking from the Julia Child cook-book; her blog turned into a book, which turned\ninto a movie and now she\u2019s famous and rich.\nWhereas I\u2019ll just eat butter, write for Felix and\ndie fat, but hey, that\u2019s life.) To balance out the\nbutter-beef cardio combo, we did nominally\norder salad: grilled fennel \u2013 delicious \u2013 and\nBrasa was rather quiet on the Friday night when we visited, but we\u2019re here to spread the word!\nLucie Jichova reviews Broadway Bar and Grill\u2019s lil bro\ntossed green vegetables: green beans, snow\npeas and brocolli. It was, err ... very green?\nFor afters, we picked a dessert with possibly\nthe longest name ever: \u201cCardamom Poached\nPumpkin with Smoked Chestnuts, Chocolate\nIce Cream and Candid Clementines\u201d. Food\nwriters who get paid by the word will love this\none. It worked for me, as I\u2019m a big fan of spices\nin desserts. The pumpkin was thinly sliced and\narranged into a rose, while the rest of the dessert was scattered around on a black board in\nthat modern obssession-with-presentatation\nstyle. And just because we\u2019re greedy, we also\nindulged on the Baked Chocolate Tart with\nBlackberry Sorbet, which was sweet, warm,\nmelting, flowing, head-spinning ... excuse me, I\nforgot I was writing about food. Also, I was on\nmy second glass of Pinot Grigio by then.\nSome of the other dessert choices on the\nmenu are odd; I know this is London and\npeople have weird tastes, but who orders rice\npudding after a steak? More interesting is the\nGrilled Banana Split with Hackney Honey.\nHackney isn\u2019t known for bees peacefully flying over meadows, but among all that council-estate deprivation, there is a teenager called\nPhilip Schilds who keeps bees on his rooftop\nand sells his honey at markets.

They are also joined by armed guards\nwhich show that this fenced-off terrain is not to\nbe taken at all lightly.\nFor most modern horror films, many of the\nplot-points are so absurd that only the most\nsenseless characters who go off in the dark on\ntheir own to \u201ccheck things out\u201d are ever used.\nClassic Cinema\nA Muppet\u2019s Christmas Carol\nWhilst the \u2018classic\u2019 status of this film may be debatable for some, it is most certainly a Christmas classic\nin my home and I suspect in many others. Knowing\nthe lyrics to all the songs and personal bias aside,\nit is an incredibly funny and light-hearted film that is\nan excellent take on the fable, successfully integrating soppy sentiment and singing vegetables into the\nclassic Dickens tale.\nMichael Caine stars as the miserable Mr Scrooge,\nwho is introduced through the medium of song in\nthe first scene, sweeping around the corner as darkness descends. Caine is commendable as the infamous miser and plays a convincing, almost entirely\nstraight, part next to lots of brightly coloured singing\npuppets and even indulges in a bit of singing himself.\nAs the original story goes, Scrooge is visited by three\nspirits, each opening his eyes to his cruel doings and\neventually making him realise the errors of his ways.\nIn the Muppets\u2019 version, a reformed Scrooge subsequently dances through the streets of London sing-ing, followed by a very small rabbit carrying a very\nlarge turkey.\nThe film also features all of the Muppet stalwarts\nin the novel\u2019s traditional roles (and some not quite so\ntraditional; Dickens may not have included an annual\npenguin\u2019s skating party, lobsters or a Swedish chef).\nKermit plays Bob Cratchit and his wife, Emily Cratchit,\nis played, of course, by Miss Piggy. The Great Gonzo\nstars as the narrator \u2013 a blue furry Charles Dickens\nwho hangs out with a rat. This rat being Rizzo the\nRat, starring as himself. Needless to say, behind all\nthese Muppet actors are the puppeteers: Frank Oz,\nDave Goelz, Steve Whitmore and Jerry Nelson among\nthem, orchestrating the cast and supplying the dizzying array of voices.\nA Muppets Christmas Carol is a heartening, incredibly funny film, which maintains all the moral and suspense of the original but with added humour, puppets\nand singing.\nCecily Goodwin\nThe most widely accepted form of interspecies love\nFilm Editors: Jade Hoffman\nMatt Allinson\nEd Knock\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA film titled Monsters carries with it a certain\nlevel of expectation to show something \u2013 well\n\u2013 monstrous. Considering this, the common\ncriticism that this micro-budget indie film lacks\nexactly that is fully understandable. Make no\nmistake, only $200,000 was spent on the production which is nowhere near close to most\nCGI-loaded films, and this is not your regular\n\u201cmutant monsters are taking over the planet\nand killing our protagonists one by one\u201d kind\nof film. Instead \u2013 and this is what has been often\noverlooked \u2013 Monsters relies on the consistent,\nunderlying tone of fear.\nThere are no jump-scares, as monsters are\nmostly heard and not seen, and are never hurled\nin front of the camera. So much can be unsettling\nabout odd noises, that no forced or unnecessary\ngore is needed to have that profound chilling\neffect. This is something that has perhaps been\nforgotten by the Hollywood thriller genre. The\nRing, to take a popular example, was generally\nwell received \u2013 but its predecessor, the Japanese\noriginal, Ringu, is widely considered the better\nfilm, partly for not showing the face of its chilling ghoul. For those ready to explore a different\nside of the sci-fi/horror/thriller genre, you will\nbe pleasantly surprised at this slightly odd but\nengaging film mixes several different themes\nand still makes it work.\nMonsters starts off with how the aliens managed to land on Earth. Six years ago there was\nevidence of extraterrestrial life on Jupiter and\nthe nosy humans had to send a spaceship to\nexplore it. When it returns, it crash-lands in\nMexico and brings with it some scary-looking\n\u2018creatures\u2019. Are they dangerous? Doesn\u2019t mat-ter. When they look like a cross between a spi-der, an octopus and a jellyfish, the United States\ngovernment doesn\u2019t think twice. They immediately seal off the area and start attacking. Gasmasks are essential and the area of infection\nstretches all the way across the US-Mexico bor-der. The Americans have also built \u201cThe Wall,\u201d\na gigantic concrete barrier designed to keep foreign agents out.\nAs a photojournalist, Andrew (Scoot McNairy) is working in Mexico hoping to snap up\nsome pictures of these allegedly dangerous and\ntoxic creatures. One day he is given an inconvenient order that he cannot refuse: his boss\u2019\ndaughter Sam (Whitney Able) is stuck in Mexico and he is asked to escort her safely back to\nthe States. He reluctantly agrees, and the two set\noff on an uncomfortable journey back to their\nhomeland. But complications arise as passports are lost, trains are stopped, and ships are\nmissed. Time is running out and the only way\nback is through the forbidden hostile infectious\nBut not with Monsters, in which everything\nwas shot on location and, aside from the two\nrelatively unknown actors, most supporting\nroles are played by local extras who happened\nto be there. The film benefits from having this\nauthentic atmosphere and therefore there is\nno need for any pointless horror clich\u00e9s that\nwaste time. This is a deeply engaging emotional drama focusing on how romance takes\nplace in the unlikeliest circumstance. Focusing\non the steadily creepy ambiance by showing\nthe many scenes of devastation, the couple\u2019s\nApocalypse Now style boat-ride, in which we\nsee cars in branches, destroyed aircrafts and\nmore evidence of horror, is a true testament to\nThis is a true testament\nto the very un-Hollywood\nidea that money can\u2019t\nbuy horror\n\u201c\ntheir own to check\neir own to chec\nwas\nand\nto\no\nin\nin\nng\ning\nat-at-pi-i-This is a tru\nThis is a tr\nto the very\nto the very\n\u201d\nhi h hi\nhi h hi\ny\ny\ncan\u2019t\ncan\u2019t\niCU Cinema - Winter All-Nighter\n6 films, 6pm-6am, Union Concert Hall\n\u00a310 for all six films, or \u00a33 for each film.\nTickets available online at union.ic.ac.uk\nEVENTS\nDirector Gareth Edwards\nScreenwriter Gareth Edwards\nCast Scott McNairy, Whitney Able\nMonsters\nJohn Park\nFriday 10 december 2010\nthe very un-Hollywood idea that money cannot\nbuy horror.\nThis is more than a mindless horror movie.\nThe film moves gently, at a controlled pace,\ngiving us the chance to reflect at the subtle\npolitical themes it evokes. Even when there is\nhardly anything happening on screen, so many\nideas have been hinted that director Gareth\nEdwards knows how to casually hold our attention without using his film to load us with\na heavy-handed political message. Immigration, war on terror and social intolerance are\namong the explored subjects that further enrich\nthe film\u2019s running time. McNairy and Able are\nconvincing together and a lot of the improvised\ndialogue helps their relationship come off as\nunforced and compelling.\nWhen the monsters do make their appearance in the film\u2019s final moments, the result is\nbeautiful and moving. Edwards not only acted\nas director, writer, producer, but also as the visual effects supervisor and he creates something\ncompletely original with the tiny budget. Are\nthese monsters really a threat? Although many\ndead bodies are seen, there is a possibility that\nthey could have been the result of the toxic\nweapons that the U.S. troops used to tackle the\nalien population. It is also suggested that the\naliens are usually docile unless provoked, most\nlikely by endless missile strikes. Who are the\nreal \u201cmonsters\u201d here? What starts off with such\na simple, over-used idea spirals out into a web\nof so many potential debates making Monsters\none of this year\u2019s most pleasant surprises.\nTaking precautions against the \u201cwhoever smelt it, dealt it\u201d policy.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nArts Editor: Rox Middleton\nMarks and Stencils\nGraffiti? Graphics? Fine Art? It\u2019s even got its own gallery\nIn the tired and increasingly tedious debate surrounding the merits and worthiness of contemporary art nothing gives rise to quiet so much\nrabid argument as the work of the \u2018street artist\u2019,\na sub-group of the common vandal. I am very\nnervous about wading into the debate, but a recent visit to an exhibition entitled \u2018Marks and\nStencils\u2019 has inevitably set me thinking. I am\nnormally of the opinion that if it looks like art,\nsmells like art and most importantly costs as\nmuch as art... then it is probably art. This philosophy should place the work of people like\nthe infamous Banksy, featured at the gallery,\nfirmly in the established artist\u2019s category. Yet I\nremain a little uncomfortable with the unques-tioning, reverence surrounding the genre.\nPictures on Walls (POW), hosted the exhi-bition. The group is essentially a marketing\ncompany which displays and sells works and\nprints by many notable street artists including\nBanksy. Their latest exhibition displayed in a\nshop in Soho contains work from dozens of\nartist. However, most of the focus is directed\ntowards their \u201ccover star\u201d Dran. This French\nartist has a distinctive whimsical wit yet his\nsubject matter remains darkly satirical. In one\nseries of works he takes cardboard boxes, subverting the text on the side with beautiful illus-trations. Below \u201cMade in Brazil\u201d sits a starving\nstreet child and below \u201cfrais de livraison gratuits\u201d a truck full of militia. Dran also invents the\ncharacter of a homeless orphan obsessed with\ngraffiti. He reproduced the image of this child\ndrawing on a wall a hundred times, filling in a\ndifferent graffiti each time. Visitors are invited\nto do the same on postcard sized reproduc-tions. A rather quaint idea, although I am not\nsure what the point is, apart from to produce a\nlot of sellable art very quickly. I was generally\nimpressed by the humour and intelligence of\nhis work which is matched by an accomplished\ndrawing style.\nThe other unavoidable artist supplied the\nmost controversial exhibit, which has been\ngiven pride of place in the window. The striking image entitled Prime by Mark Sinckler\nshows the London bus destroyed on the day of\nthe 7/7 bombings. The victims of the bombing\nare painted in the style of renaissance angels\nascending to heaven. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do is\nto make anyone that has a faith, a belief, or an\nidea they hold close to their heart to think about\nthe impact of these ideas when they leave their\nheads,\u201d Sinckler has said. I genuinely think the\npiece provokes that response. Despite the inevitable negative press attracted by the piece I\nfound it rather compelling and beautiful. Dran\nand Sinckler\u2019s work actually feels out of pace\nwith the rest of the show which consisted mostly of variably witty, often obscene cartoons or\ngraffiti.\nI left the gallery both amused and filled with\nanti-establishment fury as the artists intended.\nSo am I so unwilling to praise them? Firstly, an\nobservation; for a group who used to relish anonymity and who previously refused to engage\nwith the art community Banky and co. seem to\nbe making rather a lot of money by flogging\nstencils of rats to London yuppies. But then that\nis exactly the smug self-referential contradiction he takes pleasure in creating. In fact much\nof the work in the gallery is a direct insult to\nthe viewer for taking it seriously or the artist for\nselling out. For example the slogan \u201cStreet art,\nnow in a gallery near you\u201d is daubed on one of\nthe walls. Another sculpture consists of a broken plaster cast of Myron\u2019s \u201cDiscus Thrower\u201d\ncovered in random doodling. Yes it is funny,\nbut it is also a very cheap form of humour,\nequivalent to breaking the fourth wall in film.\nIt puts me in mind of a form of Pop art , but out\nof context and sixty years too late. You cannot\nexpect your Anti-war/capitalist/fascist agenda\nto be taken seriously while undermining your\nvery mode of communication.\nSecondly, it comes down to this, there is a\nname for someone who creates images simply\nto entertain and sell an idea. It is not artist. It\nis graphics designer, someone in advertising.\nArt in general should elicit a more fundamental\nand visceral response form the viewer than a\nsimple chuckle and a vague desire to have the\nprint hanging over your sofa back at the flat.\nSo, go see the exhibition, it\u2019s good fun. Just do\nnot expect an epiphany.\n\u201cThe thing I hate the most about advertising\nis that it attracts all the bright, creative and ambitious young people, leaving us mainly with\nthe slow and self-obsessed to become our art-ists.. Modern art is a disaster area. Never in the\nfield of human history has so much been used\nby so many to say so little.\u201d \u2013 Banksy\nMeredith Thomas\nWaugh: What is it good for?\nIt\u2019s in theatres like the Old Red Lion, that remind me why I review plays instead of just going to the see them. They want me to like them,\nand they have a bar \u2013 did I mention it was a\npub-theatre? It\u2019s a simple, yet highly effective\nequation. Regrettably though, it seems ORL\nhad banked on the bar doing the talking and\nhad overlooked a key point, viz. the play itself.\nSylvester McCoy, one time Dr. Who star\nand generally cuddly old man, leads the way\nin this production of Decline and Fall. It tells\nof the\u2026 err\u2026 decline and fall of Paul Pennyfeather, from his expulsion from Oxford, onto\nhis cuckolded marriage to the wealthy Margot\nBeste-Chetwynde and then to all that befell\nhim thereafter. The cast is, without exception,\npretty well suited to each of their respective\nroles, McCoy hams it up no end, whilst Mike\nLindall is beaten from pillar to post so much\nthat it seems it comes to him naturally. Emily\nMurphy in her multiple roles during the play is\nalso worth a mention, especially as she intimidates the audience into filling up the few seats\nof the intimate venue.\nFor those fans of Waugh out there, I warn\nyou may be disappointed. Soon you begin to\nrealize why he wrote books rather than plays,\nand you often get a sense that this book wasn\u2019t\nmeant to be a play. The number of scene changes alone makes you wish you were at home\nwith book. Whilst the intricacies of the satire\nare lost, nevertheless, certain elements are still\npreserved and the play still keeps the humour\nhigh throughout.\nORL is a brilliant theatre, beyond just the\nbeer taps, but even Sylvester McCoy couldn\u2019t\nturn around Decline & Fall. Whilst it enter-tains, it leaves little the audience feeling a little\nempty-handed, not with the acerbic pang one\nexpects from Waugh.\nI think most people have done things they regret, of\none sort or another, during their lives. Taking the\nwrong job, choosing the wrong degree even. But\nmine, well mine was more of the regret of a mistake\nthan anything. I once bought a couple of tickets to\ntouring Glyndebourne. In case you\u2019ve not heard of\nit, this is the travelling arm of a well-regarded Opera\ncompany. However, I didn\u2019t see it, so don\u2019t worry,\nthis isn\u2019t about Opera.\nI had originally bought said tickets because I\nwanted to go and see this Opera, and even had a\nguest in mind as well. She had expressed a passing interest in it, but her presence soon evaporated\nand I can\u2019t so much as recall her name now, so that\npart of it mattered little enough even to reach the\nvorspiel.\nTrouble is, I had two tickets for Glyndebourne and\nonly one bum to put on those two seats. They were\nmy favourite seats, too -- at the front of the balcony;\nideal for the view and for the purse.\nSo, I had two good tickets and no one to go with.\nAha, hang on, it was my friend Sophie\u2019s birthday.\nWe\u2019d been at school together and although she was\nradiant and the sort of woman whom one thinks to\nbe ideal as a girlfriend in every particular, there was\nnever a spark between us. Also it was her birthday\nand so would be some sort of present. The fateful\nday came but despite -- or perhaps because of this\n-- it all went rather wrong for me.\nThe curse of Don Giovanni is a peculiar one. In\nthe Opera there is no curse at all really, I use that\nterm merely to name my bollocksing it up as I did.\nThe character Don Giovanni is an inveterate wom-aniser who at one point in the story is reading out\na list of all his conquests -- the number of Spanish women, of Italian women, and so on. Shortly\nafter this sexual bean-counting, he tries to pull his\nmanservant\u2019s fianc\u00e9, the evening before her wed-ding. This gets spotted by a statue and either out\nof limestone-based jealousy or a masonaryic moral\nerectitude, he gives Don Giovanni the option to re-pent. He doesn\u2019t, and so gets thrown into the fires\nof Hell. It\u2019s known as the Terror scene because it is\nthe first depiction in Opera of pure terror.\nNot really what you would choose for a first date\nyou might say. Alright, I\u2019ll give you that. But, I was\ngoing with Sophie rather than anyone I was keen to\nimpress romantically so that was alright. Trouble\nwas, I was slightly late leaving my flat that after-noon. And as this was before the time in which\nRailway companies told you where the two halves\nof a train were, and so perhaps predictably, I got\non the wrong half. Ooops. My friend came down\nfrom Leicester, to Oxford, but of course I didn\u2019t get\nthere. Double oops. And it was her birthday. Triple\noops. And we didn\u2019t get to see the Opera. Quadruple oops. I haven\u2019t been to the Opera since.\nWell, not quite. As an end-of-PhD present, my parents have offered to fly me to Prague to see this\ncurs\u00e8d Opera to the very Opera house where this\nopera was first pr\u00e8miered in 1787, but it is the last\nOpera house still standing that Mozart conducted\nin. No pressure then. One last post script -- I was\ninvited to Sophie\u2019s wedding earlier this year, so she\ndoesn\u2019t hold it against me, even if I do.\nA whimsical cultural\nanecdote for the last\nissue of the term\nSam Furse tried to go the opera,\ndid he make it though?\nARTS\nFree at 1 Berwick St, Soho, until 22 December.

    "content": "24\nCOM M ENT\nfelix\nFRIDAY 10 decEMBER 2010\nT\nhe Biology and Biochemistry Departments are currently undergoing a Restructure and in the next\nfew months a \u2018Departmental Teaching Review\u2019 will follow.\nThis Restructure involves the removal\nof the \u2018Plants and Microbial Science\u2019\nand \u2018Cell Biology and Genomics\u2019 sec-tions. These areas were chosen for restructure due to their \u2018under-performing\u2019\nin research and the fact that they are \u2018not\nfitting in the new department structure\u2019.\nReplacing these two sections will be\none \u2018Integrative Systems Biology\u2019 sec-tion. Teaching has not been taken into\naccount, purely the involvement in re-search! 17 members of staff across the\nDepartments will be made redundant.\nThey include the Heads of each Department alongside Senior Academic Tutors and Admissions Tutors. With these\nsignificant members of staff leaving the\nDepartment, there will surely be a great\nloss to the quality of teaching available.\nOn meeting with Professor Ian Owens\non Monday, he continually reassured\nus that these changes will not affect the\ncourses available for final year students\nbut we failed to see how they would\ncompensate for the loss of such good\nlecturers and course convenors. When\nasked how it will affect PhD students,\nthey said only 10% of 200 students\nwould be affected and thus reallocated\nto a new supervisor. Overall, there will\nbe a huge disruption placed on the Department. Not only will Imperial\u2019s reputation be lowered but also student satisfaction in these Departments will take\nan even bigger hit.\nOf course there is always room for improvement in any Department but what\njustification is there for getting rid of\nthe best lecturers the Department has to\noffer?\nTheir reasoning for this Restructure is\nsaid to be; firstly, to resolve the financial\nproblem that Biology and Biochemistry\nhave been experiencing; and secondly,\nto modernise the degrees by implementing more research-based teaching. They\nhope the restructure will bring improvements such as more course choices;\nsmaller group teaching sessions; more\nsessions in real research labs; integrated\nquantitative teaching; and modernising\nof the material.\nWith 15% of the teaching staff made\nredundant, how can the Departments\npossibly achieve these improvements\nand maintain teaching excellence?\nMany of those being made redundant\nare the best lecturers, who are passionate about teaching and genuinely care\nfor students. At such a prestigious uni-versity, teaching should be placed first\nand not second to research. Research is\nvery important at this establishment but\nnot at the cost of quality teaching.\nIf financial stability were such an is-sue, would it not be more feasible to keep\nthe members of staff and open up new\nMasters courses? Currently, the Masters courses in Biochemistry are very\nlimited. For example, a Masters in Biotechnology, a branch of Biochemistry,\nPruning science\nis not offered and many students would\ntake up a place if offered. Increasing the\nrange of Masters courses will bring in\na lot of money, but instead the Review\nPanel feel the only solution is to make\nsignificant lecturers redundant.\nIt is very clear that there will be merging between Biochemistry and Biology\ncourses to compensate for the loss of\ncourse convenors. Currently, the con-venors run courses according to the research they produce, research that the\nReview Panel deemed \u2018unfit\u2019. Under the\nRestructure, newly appointed convenors\nwill be tailored according to the course\nrequirements. The experts in the areas\nhave been asked to leave and those with\nlesser expertise will take over.\nIncreased tuition fees and lowered\nteaching quality- is thiswhat Imperial\nstudents should now look forward to and\ncome to accept?\nCutting teaching staff in Life Sciences is completely\nincompatible with aims to improve teaching standards\nThere are so many things that are objectionable about the redundancies in the Life\nSciences department that one hardly knows\nwhere to begin. The staff being made redundant have had their teaching achievements\nignored and their research talked down. Undergraduates have been repeatedly assured\nthat their courses will not be impacted despite the overwhelming evidence that the\nquality of teaching will decrease and the\ncourses that they want to do will no longer\nbe available. Masters students have paid\nfor a service that they will not receive to\nthe standard that they expected when they\nforked over their cash and finally PhD students have been thrown into chaos with little\nor no information given to them. Even the\nacademics who have survived feel insecure;\nif this is how the department treats the\naforementioned groups, why should any of\nthe survivors be treated differently in future?\nThis aggressive focus on the Plant and Microbial Science (PMS) unit can be called unfair for any of a number of reasons. Most\nprominent among these would have to be\nthe highly disruptive move from the Wye\ncampus which has taken place over the\npast six years. But include an opaque use\nof statistics and a questionable vision of the\nfuture relevance of research areas and suddenly dissolving the PMS and Cell Biology\nand Functional Genomics units becomes\nindefensible.\nBut rather than attempting to inadequately\nsummarise the debate in this column, we\nwould like to recognise something intensely\npositive blooming in this deeply saddening\ntime. It is often supposed that there is some\nsort of barrier between the students and the\nstaff, and that neither is appreciated by the\nother. But this week, the divide has been\ncrossed. Students new and old have come\nout to express their appreciation for those\nmembers of staff who dedicated their time\nto ensuring that they got a top-quality educa-tion, and whose careers are now at risk.\nMaggie Dallman, the Head of the Faculty\nof Natural Sciences, unwittingly gave us\nan insight into the crux of the matter during the public meeting held this week. She\nsuggested that if Imperial took money away\nfrom accommodation and gym funding to invest in teaching, then students would again\ncomplain. But this is not the case. There is a\nnear pathological inability to recognise that\nstudents do care about their teaching and\nsome staff do care about their students \u2013 although perversely, these are the first to go.\nFELIX\nMevani Jagodage\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nBoth students and staff\ndeserve better than this\nChe was not amused by cuts to plant sciences.

After all, if it\u2019s\nbeen a very long time\nsince anything last\nhappened...\u201d\nSCIENCE\nFELIX\nFriday 10 december 2010\n14\nScience Editors: James Goldsack\nKatya-yani Vyas\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIt is commonly believed that our scaly predeces-sors, the dinosaurs, were wiped out by an asteroid\nstorm. Well forget that, because recent analysis of\nasteroids has thrown up some results which could\nactually give tabloids a legitimate reason to think\nwe\u2019re all going to die.\nYou may be thinking that death by asteroid is just\na bit ridiculous, but the threat is serious enough that\nlast year the US air force, for the first time, brought\ntogether scientists, military officers and emergen-cy-response officials to analyse its ability to cope,\nshould this scenario take place. There are already\nplans in place by governments all over the world to\ndeal with different emergency situations, but being\nhit by an asteroid is not one of them. On top of this\nour warning systems are almost useless. In 2008\nwhen a car sized asteroid exploded above Sudan,\nastronomers received only 20 hours notice.\nFortunately, the prediction that the 20-million\ntonne asteroid Apophis will possibly impact earth in\n2029 has now been ruled out. That\u2019s good news if\nyou\u2019re already in your 80s or so, however for those\nof us still alive in April 2036, there is a 1 in 45,000\nchance of Apophis colliding with Earth. Now, being\nthe person who never paid any attention in statis-tics, I wouldn\u2019t know if that\u2019s a particularly high\nchance or not, but either way I\u2019d rather not die by\nasteroid.\nAnyone directly exposed to an asteroid collision\nwould be burned and pulverised by a supersonic\nshock wave, while the rest of the world would only\nhave to deal with tsunamis, global firestorms, ozone\nholes and some seriously nasty acid rain, as well as\nthe possibility of living without electricity.\nOur best option? Deflect it, but this would have\nto be done years, not 20 hours, in advance. Then\nagain, we could try to nuke it, but that would only\nbreak it into pieces, some of which would still be\nlarge enough to create disasters, others destroying\nour satellites.\nI hate to admit to it, but maybe just this once we\nshould follow in the footsteps of America and start\nconsidering our options seriously. After all, leaving\nour survival in the hands of the USA is never a good\noption, even at the best of times. Alice Yang\nMercury \u2018turns\u2019 some wetland birds homosexual. Scientists in Florida and Sri Lanka studied the effect of\nmercury in the birds\u2019 diet to find out why the chemical\nreduces breeding. It was previously known that mercury contamination can affect animal development\nbut the researchers were surprised by their \u201cstrange\u201d\nresults. The higher the dose of mercury given to the\nbirds, the more likely a male bird was to pair with\nanother male. \u201cWe knew mercury could depress their\ntestosterone levels,\u201d explained Dr Peter Frederick,\nleader of the study. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t expect this.\u201d\nYou won\u2019t believe it...\nIn Brief\nWe could be next... Supervolcanoes\nIf, like me, your entire scientific knowledge of this subject extends to the silly\nBBC drama about supervolcanoes called\nSupervolcano, you should be terrified at\nthe long overdue volcanic eruptions to\nend all eruptions. A great deal was made\nthat Yellowstone\u2019s last three eruptions\nhave taken place 2.1, 1.3 and 0.64 million years ago \u2013 we\u2019re all living on borrowed time.\nThe problem is, volcanic eruptions are\nhard to predict at the best of times. Just\nbecause a particular volcano has erupted\nafter two \u2018regular\u2019 intervals it doesn\u2019t\nmean much statistically because there\nare an awful lot of eruptions that don\u2019t\nshow any pattern at all and two intervals is little evidence to go on. Or if we\ndo believe them to be accurate, there is\nstill a margin of error of 140,000 years.\nThat\u2019s longer than the entirety of human\nhistory. In the last 60,000 years we\u2019ve\nhad ice ages, mass extinctions and, yes,\nsupervolcanoes.\nThis is a long time for a margin of er-ror. Yellowstone is only one volcano, but\nthe \u2018average\u2019 interval between eruptions\nAre we distracted by spectacular hypothetical disasters\nwhilst ignoring the mundane ones occuring right now?\nis 800,000 years (so we\u2019re under-due).\nOf course, that figure is equally mean-ingless, and it\u2019s quite possible that an\neruption will take place next year, or in\nthe next decade. The point is it\u2019s hard to\nworry about something you can\u2019t predict\nyears in advance and is very unlikely.\nOf course eventually a supervolcano\nwill erupt and those living then will have\na miserable time but there are many\nthings that can happen in that time, and\nsome of them (climate change, food cri-sis, pandemic) are a lot more likely and\npotentially a lot more dangerous than a\nvolcano.\nOne thing such scientific documentaries as \u201cThe Core\u201d and \u201cMegafault\u201d\nmissed is there is very little that we can\ndo to prevent a volcanic eruption, even\nif you know what\u2019s coming. I\u2019m certain\nthat careful, co-ordinated preparation\nwould go a long way in reducing the\ndevastating impacts, but until it comes to\npass maybe recycling more, doing some\nlight exercise, not taking antibiotics\nwhen you have a cold and not drinking\ntoo much are much better at lengthening\nyour chances of survival. And even if it\ndoesn\u2019t improve your quality of life, it\ncertainly won\u2019t make that eruption come\nany quicker.\nFocusing on something that may harm\nyou in thousands of years, though seri-ous, is less important than many other\nthings that are much more dangerous.\nYou might want to think, for example, if\nyou really need to cross so many roads\non your way into college. After all, if it\u2019s\nbeen a very long time since anything last\nhappened...\nMatthew Parker\nYellowstone National Park: It is believed that a supervolcano could erupt from beneath the U.S. national park and basically wreck\neverything.

It is\nmy burning ambition to write a novel that will have\nthe same effect on my hypothetical readers, that\nOn The Road had on me.\nI first read it in the summer of 2009. It electrified\nme. It blew my mind. It literally caused a change in\nthe way that I think, the way that I behave and in\nmy attitude to life in general. It wasn\u2019t only the content of the story, to which I will return, it is the style\nof writing that affected me so intensely. Jack Kerouac writes with a fluidity and energy that quickly\nreduces you to a trance-like state of frenzied read-ing; each sentence is consumed with great haste\nand growing hunger. That mastery of the \u2018stream\nof consciousness\u2019 style, of which Truman Capote\nshort-sightedly dismissed as typing, not writing, is\nwhat begins to slowly re-wire your brain. The great\nspeed by which Kerouac moves from thought to\nthought, observation to observation, had a lasting\nimpact on me. Fickleness is one word for the result\nbut I prefer, as inevitably my ego would force me\nto, carefree enthusiasm.\nAnd that is before we have even mentioned the\nstory! The crux is that the narrator Sal Paradise\nchases his beautiful band of Beat mystics across\nthe United States time and again, in search of jazz,\nwomen, whiskey and \u201cit\u201d. The elusive \u201cit\u201d which\nembodies those fleeting moments of joy and im-mortality. They drive for hours and days across the\ngreat American plains, picking up hitchhikers to\npay for the gas, always searching for something\nnew to light up their eyes and raise up their souls.\nAh see, now I\u2019ve got completely over-excited\nabout the whole thing (well it is my favourite, after\nall). Let me put the book in its proper context. Jack\nKerouac was a published author, but hardly \u2018huge\u2019,\nliving in New York in the 50s. He, and his friends\nwho included Neal Cassady, Allen Ginsberg and\nWilliam S. Burroughs, were the original \u2018Beats\u2019.\nWhile he certainly had been thinking about the\nstory, much of it autobiographical, and preparing\nit for a number of years, he eventually typed the\nentire thing in only three weeks, working almost\nnon-stop with a continuous 120-foot roll of paper;\nhe believed that having to change the paper on\nhis typewriter would interrupt his natural flow of\nthought.\nThe result of that arduous effort is quite simply,\na classic. It has its detractors, I find that women\nare less enthusiastic about it than men, but in the\nwords of Bob Dylan: \u201c[On the Road] changed my\nlife like it changed everyone else\u2019s\u201d. Amen.\nby\nJack Kerouac\nOn The Road\nBallet\nI\nwas fifteen when I first went to the\nballet. It was Onegin at the Royal\nOpera House, a birthday present\nfrom my mum to me and my brother.\nI didn\u2019t know what to expect when\nI went, nor what the ballet\nwas actually about.\nFor me, the experience was\nquite alien to anything I\nhad encountered before.\nI had already gone to see\na few plays in the West\nEnd and a musical, but the\nballet seemed to be neither and\nsomehow both, at the same time. For\nthose who have never seen a ballet be-fore, the dancers \u2018act\u2019 through the cho-reography, which in turn is set to music.\nI left the opera house not knowing really\nwhat had happened and unable to appreciate it to any significant level.\nSo when a friend of mine recently brought up the topic\nof going to the ballet I\nwas a little appre-hensive.\nSix years after first entering the Royal\nOpera House, I\nwas back again to\nsee Sylvia. In between t h o s e\nyears I\u2019d like to think that I\u2019ve become a little\nmore educated in the arts. Having played in a\npit orchestra myself since then, I went to the\nballet at least expecting to be able to enjoy the\nmusic, if nothing else. I wasn\u2019t disappointed.\nThe score, composed by L\u00e9o Delibes is absolutely fantastic. Unlike many other scores for\nother ballets (including Onegin) this one really does come to fore. It sets the action for the\nballet and absolutely not the other way round.\nIt is so good that even Tchaikovsky remarked\n\u201c...the first ballet, where the music constitutes\nnot only the main, but the only interest. What\ncharm, what elegance, what richness of mel-ody, rhythm, harmony.\u201d Delibes interestingly\nuses the alto saxophone in this ballet, an instrument that (at the time more so) was never really picked up by composers for big orchestral\npieces \u2013 it\u2019s a striking tone \u2013 and anyone who\nknows it will be delighted to hear it around the\nthird act.\nThe ballet itself is not based on a\nparticularly gripping storyline. A\nshepherd is in love with the main\ncharacter, Sylvia, who is captured\nby an evil man. Fortunately a god, Eros, saves\nSylvia and returns her to the shepherd. The\nthing that makes the ballet, as mentioned earlier by Tchaikovsky, is the choreography and\nheart-rending score. First choreographed\nby Louis M\u00e9rante in 1876, it was considered ahead of its time for its use of ballerinas as masculine huntresses, but as a whole\nit is still in the style of late Romantic-era bal-let. The choreography was redone by Frederick\nAshton in 1952 for the Royal Ballet and is far\nmore modern and also incorporates mime. He\nalso styled the new ballet on the leading ballerina of the time, Margot Fonteyn, and Sylvia herself is considered an especially difficult\npart to dance. On the whole, the choreography\nand orchestration combine to make this a supremely special ballet and I felt privileged to\nbe able to see it. It is well worth looking out\nfor in the future.\nFor the moment, the Royal Opera House\nis offering its traditional Christmas season.\nBreaking with their programme for many\nyears, they are performing Cinderella instead\nof the Nutcracker. Both are equally enjoyable\nto newcomers and seasoned veterans alike. The\nNutcracker, like Sylvia, is well known for its\nscore by Tchaikovsky, while Cinderella delivers the familiar story with great choreography\n(again by Ashton) and an unbeatable score by\nProkofiev.\nThe Royal Opera House itself is a magnificent building, worth visiting just for the beautiful interior. It certainly provides a most magical setting for any ballets or operas throughout\nthe year, but nothing quite compares to Christmas time.\nIf you are ever going to see a ballet,\nthis is the time to see it and\nwith the ROH offering student\ndiscounts, this is definitely the\nplace. Tickets from under \u00a310.\nJordi Brown\nSylvia is a magical introduction to the best ticket in\nLondon this Christmas, a night at the Royal Opera House\n\u201cGreat choreography\nand an unbeatable\norchestration combine to\nmake this a supremely\nspecial ballet\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX\n4\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 10 december 2010\n16 academics have been made redundant in a\ncontroversial restructure of the Life Sciences\ndepartment. The academics, who were informed\nof the decision via email, have until the 7th of\nJanuary to decide whether to take a voluntary\nredundancy payoff or appeal and face forced\nredundancy with no significant payoff. Students\nand staff have reacted angrily to the cuts with\none unaffected member of staff privately telling\nFelix that academics are \u201clivid\u201d and Emeritus\nProfessor John Mansfield describing the whole\nprocess as \u201cunfair, misguided and probably\ndamaging\u201d.\nThe redundancies come at the end of a 5\nmonth consultation process which began in\nJuly and was forced by a cut of \u00a3635,000 in\nthe funding that the department receives from\ncentral College. The department, which has\nrun a \u00a31.5 million deficit this year, decided to\ndissolve two sections of research in order to\nmaximize research revenue. Plant and Microbial Sciences and Cell Biology and Functional\nGenomics are to be replaced by an encompassing division of Integrative Cell Biology. The\ndepartment defended its actions saying that\nthey were forced to address the long-running\nLife Sciences deficit which they could no longer ignore.\nA major campaign against the cuts has been\nled by Union President Alex Kendall in the\nstrongest show of student activism at Imperial in\nyears. Over 1,100 students and staff have signed\na petition condemning the cuts. Over 400 students and members of staff turned up to a public\nmeeting with the Head of the Life Sciences Department Ian Owens and the Head of the Natural\nSciences Maggie Dallman to show their anger\nat the cuts.\nSacked by email\nThe method by which staff were informed of\ntheir redundancy has also been widely criti-cized. Letters were sent to those who \u201c[the de-partment] didn\u2019t think was a fit\u201d while emails\nwere sent to all members of staff in order to\nconvey the information to staff at the same\ntime. One member of staff, who is being made\nredundant, called the manner in which the staff\nwere informed \u201cabsolutely shocking\u201d and added\n\u201cpeople have been here for a long time and there\nhas been no acknowledgment of their service.\nWe are extremely let down\u201d. Professor Owens\ndefended the chosen method of communication,\n\u201cThe advantage of email is that everyone gets\nthe news simultaneously, but obviously, receiving the news in such a way is gruesome.\u201d Some\nof the affected staff have worked at Imperial\nCollege for over 30 years.\nFears for teaching\nThe Union, students and members of staff from\nthe department have raised major concerns, particularly about the impact the cuts will have on\nundergraduate and PhD-level teaching. Two Directors of Undergraduate Studies, two senior tutors and two admissions tutors have been made\nredundant. Alex Kendall said the changes put\n\u201cthe very running of the Undergraduate Biology and Biochemistry degrees\u201d at risk. Students have also expressed their anger over the\nloss of arguably the most popular lecturers on\nthe Biology and Biochemistry courses. Sheena\nBungsraz, a third year biochemist, said, \u201cthe\nonly word to describe how I feel (and I am sure\nothers as well) is disgust. As an international\nstudent, I pay \u00a320,000 to Imperial and expect to\nget a world-class education. We cannot and will\nnot let this happen. Some of the lecturers being\n\u201cmade redundant\u201d are the best ones I have had\nso far.\u201d Biology and biochemistry freshers in the\npublic meeting went further and said that if they\nhad known about the changes when applying,\nthey \u201cwould have never come to Imperial in the\nfirst place\u201d.\nThe department has reaffirmed its commitment to high-quality research-led teaching and\nhas assured students that the breadth and depth\nof the courses would be unaffected. Dr Pietro\nSpanu, a reader in Molecular Plant Pathology\nwho hasn\u2019t been made redundant, said that he\ncould not see how this could be the case. He said\nthat the changes were \u201ccompletely unsettling\nfor all staff\u201d and that it sent the message that a\n\u201cheavy involvement in teaching will not be taken into account when the chips are down\u201d. The\nsentiment was shared by Emeritus Professor\nJohn Mansfield in a letter to the Head of Department Ian Owens: \u201cSadly, the present exercise\nsends out the clear signal that research income is\nthe only parameter that really matters within IC.\nAnyone who takes on important roles in admin\nor teaching is making a big mistake in terms of\njob security.\u201d\nThere is significant uncertainty regarding undergraduate courses this year. Ian Owens told\nstudents that the remaining academics would be\nable to ensure that there was no change in the\nquality of teaching but Dr Spanu said that there\nwas a \u201cfinite amount of capacity and goodwill\u201d\nto shoulder the extra work.\nThose students on the MRes in Molecular Plant Biology and Biotechnology course\nare particularly affected. The staff have been\ntold that they must leave by July 2011 but the\n12-month course, which costs \u00a319,800 for international students, does not end until October.\nIan Owens tried to reassure students by guaranteeing that supervision would be provided on\nall masters courses. Additionally he hinted that\nthere may be cases where staff are allowed to\nstay on past July 2011 to complete teaching du-ties. However it remains to be seen whether this\nwill be the case. Course Representative Tejal\nRaval said that choosing do a masters at Imperial is \u201cproving to be one of the worst decisions\nwe could have made.\u201d He said that there was anger at the lack of information given to students:\n\u201cEverything we know is through word of mouth.\nThe university has forgotten us \u2013 its masters students!!\u201d He added that the College \u201cshould be\nembarrassed by [its] actions\u201d.\nIn addition, PhD students have been left in\nlimbo regarding the status of their doctorates.\nIt is unknown whether they will be able to continue their research. Silvia Colucci, a 2nd year\nPhD student in the hard hit Cell Biology and\nFunctional Genomics section, said that she felt\nmisled about the restructure: \u201cI was told not to\nworry about it but now my supervisor is being made redundant and I don\u2019t know if there\nis anybody else at Imperial who will be able to\nsupervise me.\u201d Ian Owens agreed that the uncertainty was regrettable, but said that it was\nunavoidable until 7th January, by which point\nall of the affected staff will have decided the\ndate at which they are leaving. However Silvia\nexpressed her anger at the \u201cconstant delaying\nof information. They are always telling us to\nwait and wait.\u201d\nAdditionally at the general public meeting,\nIan Owens was asked by a postgraduate whether the department would provide all necessary\nfunding and resources to students whose funding was tied to their research and researcher at\nImperial. Asked for a categorical answer, Owens simply said \u201cYes.\u201d\nDepartment promises no reduction in\nbreadth or depth of degrees\nThe redundancies will have far-reaching consequences for a number of courses on the Biology\nand Biochemistry degree programmes. There\nare a significant number of modules and courses\nwhich are run by affected staff, in particular the\nmodule for Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions, 4 out of 5 of the staff currently teaching\nit are being made redundant. The department\nhas made a firm commitment that the \u201cbreadth\nand depth\u201d of the degree will not be affected.\nIan Owens admitted that \u201closing good teachers\nwill improve teaching, but the teaching review\nthat we\u2019re starting in January\u201d, with student in-put, would. However, Dr. Spanu rejected his assurances saying that \u201cthe cuts are having such a\ndeep impact, that inevitably courses will disappear\u201d.\nProfessor Owens admitted that running the\nteaching review after the restructure was not\nideal, saying that \u201cif it weren\u2019t for the cut [from\nCollege] in funding then we would have carried out a teaching review in the summer\u201d. He\nStaff and students rail\nagainst job cuts\nCritics say teaching will be hit hardest as Life\nSciences promise teaching review in January\n\u201cHigh-pressure environments\nmay exacerbate a problem that\nalready exists\u201d\nPacked: Skeptical students look on in G16, SAF as the Head of the Life Sciences, Ian Owens, ex\nJan Piotrowski\nKadhim Shubber\n\n"

One moment in the set sees a\nband member amplifying film being wrenched\noff a reel to add to the epic din.\nIt could, and perhaps should, all fall to piec-es; splinter off in all directions and break down\ninto a formless mess. However, it is the presence of the powerful bass and drums of Matt\nMcQuaid and Matt Schulz that holds the music\ntogether, providing the perfect foil for the two\nnoisemakers that make up the rest of the band.\nEvery wayward sound is anchored by their\nlocked-in grooves, and the results are thrilling\nto witness.\nTraditionally an improvisational group, Holy\nFuck have taken a turn towards more conventional songwriting on their new album, Latin,\nwhich places a greater emphasis on the development of melodies throughout the tracks than\nthe group\u2019s more pummelling earlier albums.\nInterestingly, it is the new tracks that suffer the\nmost in a live context \u2013 the final synth wash\nthat plays out the last third of Latin America\ngets almost entirely lost in the mix, and a shortened P.I.G.S. loses some of its slow-burning\npower. Looser numbers, such as The Pulse, allow the band to let rip and show what made\nHoly Fuck such an exciting live prospect in\nthe first place. These earlier songs, lacking the\nconstraints of song structure, allow the chaos\ninherent in the band\u2019s set-up to become the\nband\u2019s strength, as they let the rhythm dictate\nthe song\u2019s form while noises, melodies and everything in between are piled on in relentless\nabundance.\nThe Drums took to the stage in a euphoric\ndaze to the sound of electronic ambience that\nechoed the electro-pop roots of founder members Jonathan Pierce (vocals) and Jacob Graham (guitar). The four\u2013piece were complete\nwith Tom Haslow on guitar and Connor Hanwick providing the drums.\nFirst up was Best Friend which in this writer\u2019s\nopinion is the band\u2019s second best song. It has a\ncatchy tune to which you could imagine dancing along at a wedding or some other family\nfunction involving the older generations, without the risk of offending Granny or Grandpa.\nPierce put in a strong performance through-out, not just vocally but also with his animated\ndance moves. His energy filled the room and\nseemed to infect its inhabitants, with everyone\nswaying on cue.\nSet highlight Let\u2019s Go Surfing prompted the\ninfamous \u201crock on\u201d gesture from one member\nof the audience (who would probably like to\nremain anonymous). The simple and yet effective riffs were a real crowd-pleaser.\nYou may have noticed, however, that I\u2019ve\nonly named two of the songs performed. That\nmay be because they were the only songs I\nknew going into the gig or, more likely, because all their songs sound the same. For all\nThe Drums effort and enthusiasm in their live\nperformances, there isn\u2019t a lot to their music.\nThe Drums\nThe Forum\n24th November 2010\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nDaniel Beatrup\nHere are The Drums, conveniently pictured from left to right: Snare, Tom-Tom, FloorTom and Bongo... Bongo feels a little left out as he\u2019s not a standard part of the kit...\nHe\u2019ll get over it\nLacking depth and any real substance, their\nsongs consist of straightforward motifs with a\nbig dollop of teenage angst, possibly accounting for their limited and somewhat juvenile de-mographics.\nChaos and noise, as Holy Fuck dominate the Electric\nBallroom. What? That\u2019s their name!\niamamiwhoami\n\u2018BOUNTY\u2019 & \u2018In\nConcert\u201d\n\n"

The Dressage phase gave club\nChair,Andre Wilmes, a chance to show his ability to ride even the most stubborn of horses, by\nscoring a personal best while others could hardly make it move. However, we won\u2019t mention\nhis difficulty in remembering where he\u2019s supposed to go\u2026Next up, team captain and committed show jumper Mikaela Bryant\u2013Meisner\nhad the misfortune of riding against Oxford\u2019s\nleading rider. However, true to form, she pulled\noff a very creditable round, only a few points\nbehind Oxford girl. Ilse Daly\u2019s round went to\nplan with only a minor hiccup, to give the other\nteams plenty of penalty points. Newcomer Rachel was the last Imperial rider to go and did a\nsuperb job, especially considering the massive\nsize of her horse.\nAfter the Dressage rounds, Imperial trailed\nOxford by only 2 points, and competitive spirit\nwas running high. Taking Imperial into the\nShowjumping phase, Mikaela was now in her\nelement, performing a foot\u2013perfect round on\na difficult horse. Andre also rode a commendable clear round despite, or perhaps because of,\nhaving a bit of a crash in the warm\u2013up, completely demolishing the jump. Dressage rider\nIlse\u2019s least favourite round was not helped by\nher slightly hyperactive horse, who seemed\nto get more excited with every jump, but still\nmanaged to go clear. Rachel\u2019s horse had to be\none of the laziest of all time. Last to go and\nwith everything still to ride for, she rode a very\nrespectable clear round in a record amount of\ntime.\nFeeling optimistic, but by no means certain,\nthe Imperial team waited for the results with\nbaited breath. However, they had nothing to\nworry about, beating Oxford with a 4 point\nmargin, followed by Brunel and then LSE. The\nindividual placings saw Andre come in 1st, Ilse\n4th, Mikaela 6ths, with Rachel unfortunately\njust out of the placings.\nHopes are high for the next competition, to\nbe held in February and will be hosted by Imperial.\nEquestrian team\ngallop to victory\nDodgeball and Medsin\nteam up for World Aids\nOn Thursday 2nd December, Medsin Imperial\nand IC Dodgeball Club collaborated to organise the biggest charity Dodgeball tournament\nImperial has ever seen with prizes including a\n\u00a350 bar tab at B@1 for the winning team. Over\n\u00a3200 was raised and donated to World Aids\nDay to combat HIV/Aids.\nThe teams were split into four groups and\nwith each group playing a round robin to determine the top two teams, who would then go\nthrough to the Quarter Finals. Each match consisted of three games, where each game lasted\ntwo minutes.\nGroup A saw Team Asian Domination truly\nlive up to their name and come through first\nin their group, followed by Small Men in Big\nBlack Ties. Group B was overrun by teams\nfrom student halls with The Wilsonites and\nWeeks & Garden coming out on top. Group C\nwas nicknamed the Group of Death, containing\nRoyal Hollowballs (Royal Holloway University Dodgeball Team) and IC Handball Club\u2019s\nteam, La Grand Mouton. The handballers\nwere quick to point out that, in their opinion,\nDodgeball was merely Handball for \u201cdisabled\u201d\npeople. So much for political correctness! Both\nthese teams comfortably qualified along with\ngroup D\u2019s Beach Wolverines and The Sabb\nReapers, a team primarily made up of the\nUnion Sabbaticals and including Union President, Alex Kendall.\nThe Quarter Finals were a tense affair with\nsome brilliant Dodgeball on display. Weeks &\nGarden comfortably dispatched Asian Domination. They were efficiently organised and\nrun by their team captain, Tom Peake, who\nimplemented many advanced Dodgeball tactics he\u2019d picked up playing for IC Dodgeball\u2019s\nfirst team only last week. The Sabb Reapers\nwere knocked out by Royal Hollowballs in a\nthoroughly one-sided affair but not without its\nsurprises with both Heather Jones and Naida\nDzigal making kills to ensure they weren\u2019t\nwhitewashed. The Wilsonites saw off Small\nMen in Big Black Ties by three games to nil.\nThe Beach Wolverines ended Le Grand Mouton\u2019s run with a three nil win but not without\nplenty of bruises and one set of sore genitalia as\nthe Handballers put their blistering ball throwing abilities to good use. They could not, how-ever, come out on top against the Wolverines\u2019\norganisation and experience.\nIn the Semi Finals, we enjoyed a thriller between Wilsonites and Weeks & Garden. Wilsonites, captained by Scott Esnouf, matched\nW&G\u2019s tactical awareness but went ahead\ndue to some huge throwing and great counterattacking play. W&G gave themselves hope by\nwinning Game 2 and drawing Game 3 when the\nWilsonites started to employ some very negative tactics; they threw only one of the two balls\nthey had possession of for most of the game.\nBut they went on to lose the next two games\nAlan Soltani\nand go out, albeit with their dignity still very\nmuch intact. In the other semi, the Beach Wolverines came up against Royal Hollowballs.\nCheered on by the Imperial crowd and captained by Benjamin Bell, the Wolverines put to\nuse their good balance of consistent throwers\nand skilful catchers. The Hollowballs could\nnot keep possession of any balls and were being picked off in the first two games. They then\nfought back and managed a draw and a win\nin the next two. Wolverines finished them off\nhowever, ending up with a 3-1 win. The Hollowballs went on to win to third place playoff\ncomfortably over W&G.\nThe best\u2013of\u2013seven final was an exhilarating\nmatch to watch. The Wilsonites took the first\ngame against a tiring and lacklustre Wolverines.\nThis was perhaps partly due to Alan Soltani\u2019s\nidea to complete his costume by changing from\nhis trainers into flip-flops, which happened to\nbe somewhat impractical. Wolverines then regained their form and took the next 3 games albeit not without a fight. Wilsonites brought one\nback but the Wolverines went on to see them\noff 4-2 and win the tournament.\nWe\u2019d like to thank everyone who helped\norganise the tournament and all those who en-tered. We believe it was a thorough success\nand both Medsin Imperial and the IC Dodgeball Club gained a great deal of exposure. We\nhope the money raised can make a difference\nsomewhere.\nLook out for another potential tournament\nnext term in collaboration with RAG!\n90 keen dodgeballers, 15 teams, three balls, one winner\n\u201d\n\u201c\nRemember the five\nrules of dodgeball:\ndodge, duck, dive, dip\nand dodge\n\n"

Fela\nRansome Kuti, the Father of Afrobeat,\nwas something of a phenomenon. His\ninfectious and politically charged music\nwas quick to sweep the African continent and then the world throughout the\n70s and beyond. He created a wild and\nfree counter-culture against what was\na tyrannically controlled, neo-colonial\nNigeria. And he had an absolute blast\nwhile he did it.\nIt is no longer 2010 and we are no longer on London\u2019s Southbank. The auditorium of the Olivier Theatre has been\ntransformed by colourful, crazy art-work, slogans of protest, a live band and\ndraped with the flags of the fifty countries of Africa. We are now at the Shrine\n\u2013 Fela\u2019s infamous Lagos club \u2013 and it is\n1978. Nigeria is still in disarray from an\noil crisis and a military coup three years\nbefore: British colonialists swapped for\nmilitary ones.We watch the man himself sing, dance, entertain and involve\nthe crowd with the help of scantily clad\ndancers and a roaring live band, hisAfri-ca 70. Watching the dazzling cast is like\ncrashing a party that was going on any-way; there\u2019s such apparent spontaneity\nthat it\u2019s hard not to smile and feel frustrated at being confined to one\u2019s seat.\nThe show is close to three hours of\nwhirlwind colour, drumming and booty\nshaking \u2013 pure energy. It is dazzling, a\nriotous rollercoaster ride. The Nigerian\nzeal and lust for life is there and palpable both on stage and among the audi-ence. But its tempo and variety is such\nthat it does not become overbearing.\nThe frenetic dance and music scenes are\nbroken down with anecdotes about past\nrun-ins with the police told while Fela\npuffs on a fat one \u2013 Igbo \u2013 and some\naudience participation (be ready to get\noff your ass and gyrate that pelvis). Sahr\nNgaujah is flawless and gives a seamless performance with unending vigour\nas the man himself. Praise is needed for\nA mind-blowing Stroboscopic Light Pod\nJames Turrell\u2019s Bindu Shards was what\nI can only describe as an \u2018experience\u2019. I\nmanaged to obtain an elusive time slot\nfor the exhibit which I have read elsewhere as \u2018mind orgasmic\u2019. I approached\nwith some trepidation and the usual stiff,\nwhite cube-ness of the Gagosian space on\nBritannia Street did not help to quell my\nnerves. I hurried through the white halls\nto the large room in the corner in which\nsat a spherical pod \u2013 something borrowed\nfrom a dated science-fiction movie.\nI approached the pod and was greeted\nby two assistants wearing white coats (of\ncourse). I signed a waiver (a little more\ndisconcerting) and listened to the description of the two programmes for my expe-rience: hard and soft. The assistant who\nwas elaborating on these came across as\na new-wave-trip kind of girl, her voice\nlilting in her postulations on the kaleidoscopic strobes of the hard programme\nas opposed to the soft, with its bloated\nRosie Milton shapes and melting colours. Of course I\nwent for the hard version \u2013 I wanted to\nexperience a heightening of senses.\nSo I was laid down flat on a trolley bed\nand propelled into the dome. I had headphones on and all around me was flat\ncolour. What started was a kind of white\nnoise \u2013 a droning pitch that screamed\nsteadily up into the high octaves \u2013 highly\ndisorientating me as the colour in front of\nmy eyes started to pulsate. I immediately\nput my hand up into the air to \u2018ground\u2019\nmyself. Then the strobes began. Flashes\nof colour mesmerising in their rhythm,\nI experienced a strange sensation (with\nnothing to focus on), my eyes half-closed\nand the colour moved as if into my mind.\nYes, it sounds a little psychedelic but\nthere\u2019s really no other way to describe it.\nMy mind was tricked \u2013 my eyes felt as\nif they were closed in sleep \u2013 I did not\nblink for most of the duration. I had not\nknown what to expect at the beginning \u2013\nperhaps a video montage similar to the\nscene in the 1975 film Willy Wonka &\nThe Chocolate Factory when they\u2019re in\nthe tunnel on the chocolate river. A terrifying melee of imagery \u2013 spiders and\nscreaming mouths, colour and foam.\nBut instead it was just stroboscopic\nlight, and I began to see galaxies and\norbiting planets in my eyes. It was\ntruly fantastic! I emerged feeling as\nif my brain had been minced and now\nscrubbed raw. I was grateful for the grey\nlight of the dim chamber outside the\npod. I was then ushered into a side-room\nwith a squat white staircase, at the top\nof which sat a brilliant square of colour.\nAs I approached I realised that this was\na doorway to another capsule \u2013 a room\nflooded with colour! I was transported\nback to the Millenium Dome, when I\nvisited in 2000 with my school and we\nall \u2018regenerated\u2019 in the \u2018Chill-Out Zone\u2019\n\u2013 a facility I have now learnt was designed by Turrell himself. Back in the\nGagosian I hovered for a long while, lost\nin the slowly-changing palette of light,\nwhich soothed my mind and eyes. Turrell is a genius of light \u2013 he understands\n\u201cI began to see\ngalaxies and orbiting\nplanets in my eyes\u201d\nM\nany people have\nmarveled at the incredible life of one\nof the most extraordinary men that has\never lived. Many biographers have\ntried to capture his essence in words\nbut it is inevitably a rather impossible task. This play is based upon the\nbook \u201cNemesis\u201d by Peter Evans which\nfocuses on the complex relationships between Onassis, Jackie\nKennedy and the eternal mistress\n\u2013 Maria Callas.\nThe plot reveals a great deal about\nOnassis\u2019 attempts to win over the\ngreatest prize of all \u2013 Jackie Kennedy, while cleverly setting the political\nsituation after the death of President\nKennedy. At the same time, the turbulent relationship between Maria Callas\nand Onassis is unraveled, although I\nfelt that it could be further developed\nand clarified on stage. The play is unavoidably driven by the emotions of\nthe characters and builds up to the\ngreat guilt that would follow Onassis\nto his deathbed.\nRobert Lindsey\u2019s performance was\naccomplished during most of the dramatic parts of the play; however it\nvaguely resembled his performance in\n\u201cMy Family\u201d at the comic parts. On\nthe contrary, Sue Kelvin had me missing my grandmother a great deal with\nher overwhelming talent and Anna\nFrancolini\u2019s Callas was simply mag-nificent.\nBeing Greek by ethnicity, I walked\ninto the theatre with high expectations\nabout a story so closely linked to my\nculture. I was pleasantly surprised with\nthe appropriateness of the Greek music\nthat was used in the play but I could not\nhelp but cringe at the accents.\nAll-in-all though, the performance\nleft a smile on my face and an unexplained nostalgia for an era that I never\ngot to experience. I would definitely\nrecommend it to anyone who likes a really cynical fairytale.\nGREEK\nTREATS IN\nONASSIS\nKathy Christofidou\ne\nh\nh\nits power to magically alter your frame\nof mind through the eyes, from electrified to supple and dreamlike.

    "content": "FELIX 13\nSCIENCE\nWe are 7 billion\nBut how many could we be? You know, if we\nreally \u2018went\u2019 for it...\nOur population has tripled within less\nthan one generation. The major reasons\nare the crash in death rates as a consequence of controlling infectious dis-ease, higher life-expectancy and better\nquality of life. We are projected to add\nanother 3 billion by 2050; that is more\nthan Europe, Africa, and both Americas\ncombined. It is not about people having\nhuge families, it is about one billion\nteenagers reaching reproductive age.\nIf we keep this growth trend, human\ninequality and suffering will only in-crease, without mentioning the impact\non the environment. We are the most\nintelligent species on the planet and we\nhave a moral obligation to care for it.\nApproximately 2 people are born every second, 200,000 every day, and 80\nmillion every year. All need access to\nlimited resources such as food, shelter,\nenergy and water. Our history has been\nto overcome such limitations which, in\nother species, naturally balance out their\nrelative abundance.\nPopulation growth is often an ignored\nissue because it infringes on one of our\nmost personal choices. This neglect puts\nour species at peril. The Earth has supported us so far; as we grew, we exploited its resources more effectively. Today,\nwe are reaching its limits. Indeed, human density is a factor in any environmental issue. 1.3 billion people already\nlack access to clean drinking water, we\nhave to double food production by the\nend of the century, and oil demand is\npredicted to rise by 40% within the next\ntwo decades.\nRwanda\u2019s population is growing at a\nhuge speed; it is predicted to double in\n26 years. As 80% subsist on what they\ncan grow, experts believe the genocide\nwas strongly related to a too dense\npopulation and competition for scarce\nresources. Are we reaching our carrying\ncapacity? William Rees has applied this\necological concept to man. He stresses\nthat it totally depends on lifestyle. He\nhas worked out the \u201cproductive bio-capacity\u201d of the earth, measured as \u201cglobal\nhectares (gh)\u201d. If we were to share this\nproductivity evenly, there would be\ncirca 2 gh per capita per year. But the\nreality is very different: Africa uses just\nabove half of that share, the average Indian uses less than half, but Europe uses\n4.55 gh with the UK on top averaging\n5.33! The US use over 4 times their fair\nshare.\nSo, if all humans lived like the average Indian, the Earth could support 15\nbillion people, and up to 18 billion if we\nconsumed like the average Rwandan,\nbut only 2.5 billion with the UK living\nstandard and 1.5 billion with the American standards! Yet the picture may be\neven darker, since these calculations assume the availability of resource levels\nthat are thought not to be sustainable for\nthe near future.\nWe currently consume 1.5 \u2018Earths\u2019 in\nterms of sustainable capacity. Even in\nterms of waste degradation, the Earth\ncannot keep up! A good example is Poland\u2019s landfill mountains. People in developed countries need to give up a great\ndeal of their consumption to give the\necological space for the needed growth\nin the Third World.\nFor example, it takes as much as 8,000\nlitres of water to produce a hamburger\nand 3,000 litres to produce a shirt \u2013 we\ncan choose a path with a smaller foot-print. Evidently, we must also switch to\nefficient and renewable technologies.\nBut how to legally restrict the number\nof children a couple is allowed to have?\nChina introduced its successful One\nChild policy in 1979, following decades of famine. In 1977\u2019s India how-ever, Indira Gandhi introduced a \u201ccrisis program\u201d: the penalisation for any\ncrime was sterilisation. That year only,\n8 million people were sterilised. Strong\nrevolts brought the government down.\nThis shows how easily perverted legal\nrestrictions may be.\nBut there are other ways: educated\nwomen often choose to have fewer kids\nas they marry later. In Kerala, India, 1.5\nchildren per household is standard. Unsurprisingly, the region has India\u2019s highest literacy rates, and the average marriage age is 28 in contrast with 18 across\nthe rest of India. On top of enhanced\neducation, contraception can perhaps\nalso be used as a powerful technology to\nsolve the population problem.\nVictoria Bignet\nBarley disease\nsequenced\nResearch suggests genome\nparasites help adaption\nJames Goldsack\nResearchers from the beleaguered Department of Life Sciences at Imperial\nCollege have sequenced the genome\nof a major fungal disease that affects\ncereal crops including barley. This\nbreakthrough could advance our understanding of the evolution of plant\ndiseases. The research suggests that\nparasites within the fungal genome help\nthe disease adapt and evade the plant\u2019s\ndefences.\nThe findings could help develop new\nagricultural techniques for protecting\ncereal crops. Barley is central to the\nbrewing industry as well as being the\nbasis of many staple foods, so ensuring\nthe plants are disease-free is increasingly important.\nThis research, let by Dr Pietro Spanu, decoded the genome of Blumeria,\nwhich causes powdery mildew. This affects many vegetables and cereal crops\nin northern Europe. Farmers use fungi-cides, genetically resistant varieties and\ncrop rotation to prevent mildew epidem-ics, but the fungi often evolve too rapidly for these to be effective. This can\noccur because multiple parasites within\nthe genome, known as \u2018transposons\u2019,\nhelp it to disguise itself and go unrecognised by the plant\u2019s defences. The\ntransposons confuse the host plant by\nchanging the target molecules that the\nplant uses to detect the onset of disease.\nThe team discovered that Blumeria\nhas an unusually large number of trans-posons. \u201cIt was a big surprise,\u201d said Dr\nSpanu, \u201cas a genome normally tries to\nkeep its transposons under control. But\nin these genomes, one of the controls\nhas been lifted. We think it might be\nan adaptive advantage for them to have\nthese genomic parasites, as it allows the\npathogens to respond more rapidly to the\nplant\u2019s evolution and defeat the immune\nsystem.\u201d\n\u201cWith this knowledge of the genome\nwe can now rapidly identify which\ngenes have mutated, and then can select\nplant varieties that are more resistant,\u201d\nsaid Dr Spanu. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to develop\nmore efficient ways to monitor and understand the emergence of resistance,\nand ultimately to design more effective\nand durable control measures.\u201d\nMildew pathogens are \u2018obligate\u2019 para-sites, completely dependent on their\nplant hosts for survival. This dependence is why the pathogens have had to\ndevise a way to disguise themselves.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve now found this happening in\nlots of fungi and fungal-like organisms\nthat are obligate pathogens,\u201d said Dr\nSpanu, adding that the costly genome\ninflation could therefore be a trade-off\nthat makes these pathogens successful.\n\u201cNon-obligate pathogens are not so dependent on their hosts, as they can live\nelsewhere,\u201d said Dr Spanu, \u201cso they are\nless dependent on rapid evolution.\u201d\nDid you know that Wally went on to help Osama Bin Laden escape capture in Afghanistan? I guess people change\nBarley leads to beer. Beer leads to all that is good. I love you barley\nFriday 10 december 2010\n\n"

    "content": "Theresa May has so far stood by the immigration cap\nSpeaking to the House of Commons on\n23rd of November, the Home Secretary\nTheresa May announced plans to cut\nthe number of non-EU immigrants by\na fifth from next year. Student visas are\namongst one the proposed targets for the\ncut. In light of the impending visa restric-tions, the future of international students\nin UK seems increasingly uncertain.\nIt is easy to see how international students are by far the easiest target. Given\nthe high unemployment rate, the government promised to reduce the net inflow of\nmigrants to \u201ctens of thousands\u201d by year\n2015 to protect British jobs. This means\nthat the current immigration figure has to\nbe halved in the span of less than 5 years.\nSince the government cannot control the\nmovements of EU citizens or British\nexpatriates, the cut will mainly involve\nnarrowing the channel for immigrants\nfrom outside the EU. Most of such immigrants belong to three major categories:\nhighly skilled labour, students and family seeking to join their relatives in the\nUK. Tough measures preventing family\nreunions may attract the ire of settled\nimmigrants and are against the Human\nRights Act. Highly skilled workers provide valuable expertise to businesses,\nwhose powerful lobby groups ensure\nthat \u201cintra-company transfers\u201d are not\nPOLITICS\nFELIX 21\nImmigration cap\nwill hit international\nstudents the hardest\nFriday 10 december 2010\neconomy.\nIf the prospects of finding suitable\njobs are poor, earning an UK degree\nmay become a lot less attractive for the\nprospective students. Overseas students\nare shrewd consumers who vote both\nwith their cash and feet. As the demand\nfor higher education ballooned due to\nrising household income in emerging\neconomies, education has evolved into\na fiercely competitive global industry. In\ncountries like Australia, higher education spending by international students\ncontributes to a significant proportion of\ntheir GDP.\nWhile the UK attracts the second largest number of overseas students now, it\nmay soon lose its position if visa permits are drastically reduced. The globe-trotting youngsters are spoilt for choice\nwhen it comes to choosing an overseas\neducation. If they feel unwelcome in\nBritain, they may simply move off to a\nmore student-friendly place like Canada\nor Australia.\nThe political motivations for the immigration cap can hardly justify the\nlong term ramifications of restricting\nthe inflow of students. While the coalition government tries its best to shore up\nits promise to the electorate, it might be\nwell worthwhile to remember that these\nstudents will be harder to coax back\nonce their sights are set elsewhere.\nrestricted. This leaves only the students,\nto whom more that 50,000 entry permits\nwere issued in the first quarter of 2010,\nopen to drastic cuts.\nInternational students have little political voice to speak of. Overseas students have virtually no influence in a\ncountry where public policies are influenced heavily by poll results and opinions of British public. While the recent\nproposed tuition fees hike sparked street\nprotests, international students have quietly resigned themselves to paying fees\nmore than double of that amount. When\nthe immigration cap on students comes\ninto force, these students are unlikely to\nbe found waving placards angrily at politicians either. This makes cutting student visas a tempting option for a government hard pressed to show the public\nthat it is in control of immigration.\nAt a time when government funding\nfor higher education institutions is being\nsqueezed, universities across the board\nmay increasingly look to international\nstudents for a steady income stream.\nFurthermore, the majority of postgraduate students in fields such as computer\nscience and biotechnology consists\nof international students. As students\nprovide an important talent pool for\nresearch and innovation, diminishing\ntheir numbers will affect the long term\ncompetitiveness of the UK\u2019s knowledge\nBritain\u2019s political leaders are having\na rough December. As three wise men\nsteadily travel from the East to a barn\nin Bethlehem with gifts of gold, myrrh,\nand frankincense, it seems that we at\nhome have been left to cope with three\nvain stooges that can only offer broken\npledges, little international presence,\nand noticeable inexperience.\nFirst, there\u2019s David Cameron. He\ncomes across as the sort of snotty fun-killing school prefect that commands\nhis peers to stop setting fire to some first\nyear\u2019s testicles in the spirit of hearty\nEtonian initiation ceremonies, only to\nsee the gang turn on him. And it seems\nBarack Obama agrees. Last week, leaked\ndocuments disclosed that the US President declared \u201cWhat a lightweight!\u201d following his first meeting with the PM and\npaign, don\u2019t forget that Nick Clegg described the bid as \u201cunbeatable\u201d back in\nAugust. A prediction that proved dangerously premature. He also pledged to not\nraise tuition fees before the election and\nhas conceded that he had \u201cnot been able\nto deliver the policy that we held in opposition.\u201d To be fair, at least he has managed to achieve something that Labour\nrule failed to do over a decade; politicise\nthe youth. Even if it is to aim fire extinguishers at him from Millbank Tower.\nYet his inexperience is shining through.\nThere is a reason big business doesn\u2019t\nback the Lib Dems. Remember when everyone \u201cagreed with Nick\u201d? Nowadays,\nit is Nick that agrees with David.\nBut let us not forget Ed Miliband.\nWhen Gordon Brown left the political\nscene in May, having been a lame duck\nfor three years, Labour had the chance to\nre-kindle the spirit of the early Blair era.\nwas distinctly unimpressed. Cameron\u2019s\ntransparent attempts at brown-nosing\nwere also frowned upon by Obama.\nCameron\u2019s international status was\nfurther undermined when England\nfailed to secure the FIFA 2018 World\nCup. Was the PM out of his depth when\ndealing with the crooked, two-timing\nshifty executives of football\u2019s governing\nbody? Three of FIFA\u2019s executives are\nsuspected of taking bribes in an alleged\nscandal involving around $100m of secret payments. A fourth is said to be involved in the corrupt sale of World Cup\ntickets. Did Cameron not understand\nthat either you stay away from these unpleasant warts, and don\u2019t go on a Sepp\nBlatter schmoozing trip to Switzerland,\nor you play by their rules? He was ama-teurish; his faux charisma no match for\nMachiavelli\u2019s star pupil Blatter.\nRegarding the FIFA World Cup cam-Weakness plagues British politics, but not Top Gear\nCharles Betts\nLingxi Huang\nThe leadership contest was largely between two brothers: David and Ed.

    "content": "BUSINESS\nFELIX\nFriday 10 DEcember 2010\n18\nBusiness Editors: Sina Atherian\nAfonso Campos\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSo, what is Islamic Finance, really?\nGive me the basics.\nTo put it relatively simply, Islamic Finance is an alternative way of going\nabout financial dealings; these are conducted in such a way that they comply\nfully with the religious requirements of\nIslam. It is generally fully governed by\nand compliant with Sharia Law, the Islamic Law derived from the Holy Koran as well as the Sunnah, the habits\nand sayings of the Prophet Muhammed.\nThe overarching statements and rules\nare implicit in these texts, but the intricacies of how they apply to real world\nsituations tend to be decided based on\ninterpretation by panels of senior financial professionals and learned scholars\nof Islam.\nWhat is the main difference from conventional finance?\nIt is a wildly different model that stems\nmostly from a fundamental and theological difference in the view of eco-nomics. In Islamic Finance, given its\nreligious groundings, the dominant idea\nis that God as a creator is responsible\nfor all happenings, including economic\nsituations. This view is not subscribed\nto by conventional banking and finance.\nFrom this stems the chief idea that in Islam, money is not viewed as a tangible\nasset, but simply as a measure and store\nof value, and as such, should not itself\nexclusively generate more money. This\nrestricts ways in which business can be\ndone.\nThe most prominent difference is that\ninterest, known as \u201criba\u201d, is not allowed.\nThis means that banks cannot charge\nborrowers for interest on their loans and\ncustomers cannot receive interest on\ntheir deposits.\nWhat else separates the two?\nIslam does not allow an excess of uncertainty and hence, does not allow gambling either. As a result, it is forbidden\nto speculate wildly in the financial markets with overly leveraged instruments\nand complex derivatives. Big bets on\nvolatile products are therefore not desir-able. An ethical investment policy also\napplies. Islamic financial institutions\nmay not invest in or have dealings with\nany business that violates the basic rules\nof the religion or could be construed as\nimmoral. It is absolutely out of question to invest in companies related to,\nor directly involved in: pork products,\nalcohol, pornography, arms and defense,\namongst others.\nHow then, are banks able to provide\nservices to customers?\nIn order to fund their operations as a\nbusiness, instead of charging interest,\nbanks accrue a fee that takes into account\nall of its running costs. This includes\ncost of human capital, technology and\ninfrastructure; the cost is then shared by\nthe banks\u2019 customers in the form of said\nfee. This means that an increase of the\ncustomer base is usually translated into\na reduction of fees charged. Of note is\nthat the opposite, is clearly also true.\nIn order to reward customers for their\ndeposits, instead of offering interest-bearing accounts, the bank engages in\ninvestments and will share any profit (or\nloss) with the customers. This sharing\nagreement is absolutely crucial in Islam\nand contrasts vigorously with the way\nconventional banks tend to work, where\nself-interest is often evident.\nCan companies raise bonds, or customers borrow money then?\nFirms, sovereigns and governments can\nraise a different kind of finance. This is\ndone in the form of Sukuks. These are\nakin to bonds, except they do not formally guarantee a return, even though\nthey are often backed by governments.\nIn a way they resemble the ownership\naspect of equities, except that they follow a bond-like structured payout.\nIf a customer wanted to borrow money for a car, a new TV or even a house,\nthey would engage in a form of credit\nsimilar to leasing called \u201cMurabaha\u201d.\nA focus on: Basics\nof Islamic Finance\nAfonso Campos interviews himself to provide you with\nan introduction to the world of Sharia-compliant finance\nRead this article\nonline at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nSnippets\nHouse prices down... again\nA study by Halifax, the lender, has clearly shown that\nthe average house price has seen a 0.1% decline in\nNovember. This adds to the overall trend in which\nthe housing market finds itself. The Land Registry\nfigures confirm this downward trend.\nExperts believe that the continued decline arises\nfrom a lack of available mortages and banks\u2019 reluctance in handing them out to first-time buyers or\nthose with a lower initial deposit.\nBush era tax cuts extended\nOn Monday, the United States Congress and President Obama have reached an agreement that extends lower taxes for all earners, including the rich,\nfor an additional two years. These lower taxes are a\nproduct of ex-President Bush\u2019s administration.\nAn aide to Mr Obama has said that the president\nwas forced to do this in order to cut a deal with Republicans to extend unemployment pay, a source\nof much contention between the two parties. David\nAxelrod said that the Democrats are \u201cnot going to\nplay Russian roulette with the lives of the American\npeople, with all the millions of people that are going\nto lose their unemployment insurance right now without this bill going forward\u201d. That said, Mr Obama is\ncurrently having to lobby members of his own party.\nNew Financial Worlds Conference\nThe Imperial College FInance Society will be playing host to its first finance conference, which is not\nunlike ones previously organised by students at the\nLondon School of Economics or University College\nLondon.\nThe Imperial conference has a focus on investment\nbanking activities, rather than private equity firms or\nhedge funds, separating it nicely from the LSE one.\nThe Finance Society has taken the view that in real-ity, buy-side firms do not recruit as many graduates.\nAs such, it says the conference is \u201cgeared towards\neducating students and providing them with a great\nplatform to get a graduate job\u201d.\nConference organisers have been able to secure\nsome outstanding speakers, including Michael Brennan of Morgan Stanley, Global Head of Crude Oil,\nFuel Oil and Shipping Trading; David Long, Global\nHead of Equities at J.P\n. Morgan, David Simmonds,\nthe Global Head of Research and Strategy at RBS.\nWorthy of note is that no other conference has garnered the support of so many investment banking\ninstitutions.\nThe event, to be held at the exquisite Bloomberg\nHeadquarters in February and is priced at a very reasonable \u00a324.

As Bernice was celebrating her 21st birthday, the team\nknew that the option of losing and ruining her big\nday was not an option.\nThe match continued with IC playing a fantastic game throughout, reminding GKT of the rules\nwhen perhaps they had forgotten them. Hard, accurate passes meant that we maintained possession\nleading to our eventual win.\nDuring the match there were a few disagreements\nbetween GKT and one of our umpires, so our opposition decided to play dirty. The IC girls were able\nto step up to this challenge with fantastic interceptions as always from WDs Rachel Zaborski and\nSorcha Cotter aiding our winning campaign.\nAs the final ball was thrown to the GKT semicircle our GD, Bernice, and their GA went for the\nball...Well, Bernice went for the ball; the GA decided that the aim of netball is to take out the op-position.\nWith a crunch of an ankle and a bang of a hip,\nBernice went down furiously uttering the words \u201cif\nthis means I can\u2019t wear heels on Friday!\u201d (for you\nthat don\u2019t know that is when the Netball Christmas\nDinner is!) Nice to know that even with an icepack\nexpertly strapped to her pink socks with selotape,\nwhich had been carefully applied by Sorcha Cotter,\nBernice knows her priorities!\nWith the match over and the umpires paid, Bernice hobbled off to spend the rest of her 21st Birthday in style at Chelsea and West A & E.\nRugby 2s\nback on track\nDavid Wilson\nRugby Union\nImperial 2s 27 - 17 LSE 1st\nImperial 2s got their season back on track with a\nmoral boosting victory over LSE 1st team. The 2nd\nXV had been without a win in the league this season but earned the result this week after tiring out\nthe LSE forwards and scoring their tries by cutting\nthrough he opposition\u2019s back line with lethal preci-sion.\nThe match was played in perfect conditions at\nHarlington, but Imperial went a penalty behind\nbefore they found their rhythm going into half\ntime sitting comfortably. The team knew that they\nneeded to build on their promising first half performance and put a respectable score on LSE, a team\nwho offered a lot of bulk up front but little attacking threat.\nLSE started the second half better and caught\nImperial on the break, who still appeared to have\ntheir minds on their half time break.Good work\nby the front row put pressure on the LSE scrum\nwhich was consistently disrupted.Imperial secured\na much needed victory which the team aim to build\non in the new year.\nAnother Equestrian win\nPage 54\n\n"

    "content": "The National originate from Ohio.\nThey are made up of vocalist Matt Berninger who fronts two pairs of brothers:\nAaron (guitar, bass, piano) and Bryce\nDessner (guitar); and Scott (bass, guitar)\nand Bryan Devendorf (drums). Collectively they continue to create the most\nenigmatic, hermetic and beautifully absorbing music. In my opinion they are\ncurrently the most exceptional band in\nthe world and this evening I am privileged to witness their completing a trio\nof sold out nights at Brixton Academy.\nSuch fanatical sentiment in regard to\nThe National is not new. Indeed, while\nmany were already professed devotees,\nthis band first sucked me in 2009 during the post-Boxer era. This alluring LP\nhad already propelled The National into\nthe lime light, with the Democrats campaign adopting the record\u2019s signature\ntrack \u2018Fake Empire\u2019 as they headed for\nthe White House.\nSoon after my first looped listens of\nBoxer I would discover that The National\u2019s own rise did not quite match\nthe majestic nature of Mr Obama\u2019s\n2009 ascent. The early stages of their\njourney included gigs supporting high\nschool bands and numerous occasions\nwhere the towel was nearly thrown in.\nThankfully, they persevered, spurred\non by a dogged belief that their way is\nthe best way, seamlessly alternating between low-fi garage rock and orchestral\narrangements with sublime brass and\nstrings. Their obsessive and perfectionist tendencies in recording has ensured\neach of their 5 records has evolved\nfrom its predecessor, permitting them to\nslowly build a cult following, much in\nthe mould of an early R.E.M.\nThe 5,000 in attendance this evening\nardently welcome the five-piece. In the\nnervous excitement emanating from\nboth the band and the crowd it takes\nabout 3 songs for things to settle and\nthe band to find their groove. Beringer\nprowls around the band, slapping his\nthighs in a trance-like state in between\ncompelling the crowd with one of the\ngreat modern day baritones. The Dessners\u2019 and Devendorfs\u2019 hit sweet spots\nin their rhythms and guitar licks, all\nbacked up with melodic keys and elegant brass. This evening the National\nare poetic and heartfelt but never pretentious or self-indulgent. Their banter\nis humble and humorous; the music ornate and sublime.\nIconic front men channel the genius and spirit of seminal bands, Thom\nYorke, Michael Stipe, Robert Smith et\nal. all uniquely embody the essence of\nthe music they front. Similarly, Beringer\nis the perfect outlet for The National\u2019s\ndistinct and textured take on alternative\nrock music. It is difficult to take my eyes\nof Beringer; his frenetic movements and\ncalm swigs of lager keep you on edge,\nbut it is the articulate and oblique lyrics,\nmade increasing poignant by his deep\nregister, that keep you hooked. In the\nband\u2019s beginning, Beringer was often\ninappropriately labelled as a one-trick\nThe National do it their way\nThe National preach to the converted as they captivate the Brixton Academy\nbar stool poet; a decade later he is now\ncelebrated as perhaps one of the finest\nwordsmiths of this generation. Ironically, some of his best narratives come in\nthe songs most explicitly about drinking\nsuch as fan favourites Slow Show and All\nThe Wine, both warmly received by the\ncrowd this evening.\nThe National perform a Jekyll and\nHyde setlist this evening. The explosive and aggressive Abel is impressively\ndelivered with Beringer ferociously\nscreaming My Mind\u2019s Not Right. This\ncontrasts to the delicate finger picking\nof the Green Gloves which follows,\nwith Beringer serenely lamenting, \u201cfalling out of touch with all my friends are\nsomewhere getting wasted, hope they\u2019re\nstaying glued together, I have arms for\nthem\u201d. Squalor Victoria and Sorrow ex-The National\nBrixton Academy\n24th November 2010\nTytus Murphy\npose their dark and pensive side, whereas the infectious and melodic Lemonworld has a dream-like element.\nUpon returning from their \u2018theatrical\ntea break\u2019 as Beringer wryly puts it, The\nNational deliver a memorable encore.\nThe anthemic Mr November and Terrible Love are played in a whirlwind\nand epic manner respectively, but is the\ncloser Vanderlye Crybaby Geeks which\nmakes the evening special. They perform the song Unplugged, encouraging\nall to join in the cry of \u2018all the very best\nof us, string ourselves up for love\u2019, it is\nan immensely uplifting ending.\nJust as Arcade Fire have recently\nmanage to sell out big arenas whilst\nmaintaining their artistic integrity, The\nNational are reaching a wider audience\nbut doing it all on their own terms.\nThis dynamic duo, formally known as\nCherry, fired up at Heaven.Aset mainly\ncompromised of tracks from Ratatat\u2019s\nnewest album LP4, was complemented\nby trippy video projections spanning the\nrear of the stage, creating a pleasantly\nmulti-sensorial experience. Jungle beats\nwere harmonised with warped collages\nof sorts, featuring everything from animal portraits to volcanic eruptions.\nThe two New York based musicians\ntook the stage to the obvious delight of\na crowd made up of an array of young\nmusic junkies. One particularly enthusiastic fan caught himself shouting\n\u201cI AM MUSIC!\u201d in anticipation. The\noddly indistinguishable, long haired and\nskinny jean clad duo delivered an energetic performance, alternating between\nelectric guitars, a pair of drums and a\nsynthesiser. The result was a unique\nsound ranging from hip hop in its purest form to indie electronic breaching\nthe boundaries. Each track is a creative\nexperiment, all of them as catchy as\nthey are ambitious. Vocals are nearly\nabsent from their songs, while down\nbeat rhythms and organic textures are\nmeshed to create a plethora of original\nmaterial. Strong melodies and beautiful\ndrops made it easy to fall into somewhat\nof a trance, fed by an impressive light\nshow and a sweet sound system.\nRatatat flourished as a main act,\nhaving only indulged in their music in\na more mellow light in the past, I was\ncurious to experience the genius, instrumental sound live. Finding it impossible to keep still one\u2019s body seemed to\nhave a mind of its own; in sync with the\nrhythms streaming from the stage the\ncrowd swayed to the beat. Arriving at\nthe show with considerable hopes I left\non a euphonic high.\nRatatat duo flourish under the arches\nRatatat\nHeaven\n07th December 2010\nKatherine Portilla\nPrior to Buckingham Palace being built in 1702, it was the site of an\ninfamous brothel... coincidence I THINK NOT! Yeah, you think about that\nUnfortunately the handy bag and bicycle pictured are not official members of The National... They are in my line-up.\nMUSIC\nFELIX\n36\nMusic Editors: Greg Power\nLuke Turner\nChristopher Walmsley\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nFRIDAY 10 decEMBER 2010\nOne fan shouted \u201cI\nAM MUSIC!\u201d\n\n"

As\nhe rhetorically states: \u201chow can you know your place\nin the world if you haven\u2019t seen it?\u201d\nWhy: Guided by his training in marketing and man-agement, little wonder that Amar created his site\nfrom scratch and transformed it into one of the most\nwell-respected travel blogs within the community. An\nexperienced traveller, having recently returned from\nhis round-the-world travel, his site offers sound advice that I can only deem invaluable.

Have hilarious travel tales to tell? Send us a\ntweet with the hashtag #FelixTravel\nN\nestled on the stool, the silhouette was none other than what\nobstructed me as I wrestled,\npints in both grasps, my way\nto the booth where my friends\nwere seated. I bellowed a \u2019scuse-me \u2013 my voice\ndrowned out amid patrons of the busy Queenstown bar \u2013 and attracted his attention. Hysteria, on both our parts, ensued and overwhelmed\nthe venue.\nI had run into none other than Luke Turner,\nFelix\u2019s very own music editor, in the middle of\nNew Zealand.\nJust as the exhilaration settled and dampened,\nit was then the mysterious fabrication of fate\nthat struck us hard. Sure enough, it was no ser-endipitous, random encounter that dumbfounded us both \u2013 the friend I had come visit was\nundertaking a ski instructor course, and one of\nher fellow attendees happened to be a friend of\nLuke\u2019s.\nThus be the phrase \u2018sheer coincidence\u2019 condemned to becoming an eternal understatement.\nEver since bitten by the travel bug such \u2018coincidences\u2019 have tiptoed into my rucksack,\nsprouted exponentially and now parasitically\nattach itself to my traveller\u2019s lifestyle \u2013 no more\nevident than the sighting of uncanny, seeming-ly-unconnected Facebook mutual friends.\nQuoting Facebook may sound like a crude\nanalogy, though exclaiming upon realising your childhood friend is in a relationship\nwith a travel companion you\u2019ve met in Fiji, or\nstumbling into someone at a bar in Prague who\nknows members of your extended family, is no\nsocial-media trickery.\nAs travelling becomes increasingly accessible \u2013 with more people exploiting such accessibility \u2013 is the world becoming smaller?\nTravelling \u2013 combined, arguably, with social\nmedia \u2013 exposes the traveller to innumerable\nsocial opportunities the older generations could\nnever have bargained for. Especially when\nmodern technology, the said social media, allows us to maintain acquaintances we\u2019ve made\non the road.\nBut is getting acquainted with heaps of individuals overwhelmingly a good thing?\nNot when emotions spiral out of control. In\nparticular for the long-term, perpetual traveller,\nwhose lifestyle and philosophy stand antagonistically against the concept of \u2018remaining stationary\u2019, any desire to cement a friendship is\nwhat the determined traveller must suppress.\n\u201cTravel can subtract distances as easily as it can\nlengthen them, plus a\ncouple of complimentary\nbarriers and brick walls\u201d\nTravellers have a higher chance of getting laid, but more\noften rendered heartbroken \u2013 discuss. By Dylan Lowe\nThey only come free with purchase of a travel package \u2013 real-time travel, not on WoW\nLikewise, when travellers are embroiled in\nintimacy and mutual affection, travel can tear\nlovers apart in the cruellest of fashions.\nRather tragic, this irony is: that travel can\nsubtract distances as easily as it can lengthen\nthem, plus a couple of complimentary barriers\nand brick walls.\nThough, is saving yourself from heartbreak\nor two justification enough for you to shun and\nelude from travel? Hardly.\nThe fact is that travelling is, inevitably, interwoven with our lives whether we like it or\nnot. Remove the glamour and principle of exploration \u2013 what becomes clear is how travel\nis fundamentally a lifestyle we are all obliged\nto obey.\nFrom the laborious extraction of oneself from\nbed to lecture hall, from the Odyssey-style\nvoyage that has you traversing countries and\ncontinents to visit family and friends, the sort\nof travel I\u2019m urging you to consider is that of\nnecessity.\nNot to mention other travellers headed in your\ndirection. Unless one is so blinded by reckless fondness, like yours truly, one wouldn\u2019t\nproceed to committing to a relationship with,\nsay, an Australian girl who, to her dismay, was\nhomebound mere weeks after the spark ignited.\nYet, what is there to despair and regret?\nWhen life is fleeting and encounters briefer\nstill, shouldn\u2019t we treasure the moments have-been rather than fret about their non-existence?\nTravel may strip you bare, it is still your fa-cilitator of miraculous occurrences. Grievous\npartings may be, avoiding them by leading a\nmundane subsistence is, in my humble opinion,\nno more bearable.\nBesides, what negative emotions travel inflicts upon you, it compensates and remedies\nwith new amities, with your appetite for thrill\nand unpredictability quenched. We are \u2013 if I\nmay speak on behalf of you all \u2013 addicts of surprises after all.\nSo in the words of Homer Simpson, albeit\nwith a significant alteration, I would like to\npropose a toast: to travel, the problem of \u2013 and\nsolution to \u2013 all of life\u2019s problems.\nMarriage, kids, mortgage, confinement, care home, death \u2013 better carpe diem bitches\n\n"

What goes on\ninside the circuitry of your computer as\npackets of information are sent through\nit? Enter TRON. It is the sci-fi geek\u2019s\nultimate fantasy \u2013 a whole world lying\nout there, inside those clusters of computer networks. The entry? Just beam\nyourself in with a prototype particle\ndistruptor/reconsitutor, picked from that\nexperimental physics lab.\nThe original TRON (1982) follows the\nadventure of genius programmer Kevin\nFlynn on the day he gets beamed into the\nGrid, the cyber world of TRON. Inside\nit, he teams with anthropomorphic programs TRON and RAM in their quest\nto defeat the tyrannical Master Control\nProgram and liberate the Grid. TRON\n\u2013 though not a major box office success\n\u2013 was visionary. The idea that computer\nprograms have personalities and emo-tions, that they live in a society with its\nown culture, was absolutely enticing to\nmy inner geek. TRON was a pioneer for\nadopting the then-limited CGI technology into its conceptual design. Even the\ndigital world itself, the Grid, resembles\na half-finished render.\nDecades later, with CGI now able\nto create fluid life-like characters, it\nspawns the remake. Here, Sam Flynn\nreceives a mysterious message from his\nfather, Kevin Flynn, who disappeared\n20 years ago. As he traces the message,\nhe tumbles down the rabbit hole into\nTRON world and thus begins his adventure to search for his dad.\nTRON: Legacy is an ambitious movie.\nIt was shot using the most advanced\n3D cameras at the time \u2013 cameras one\ngeneration above those used in Avatar,\ncreated by James Cameron\u2019s team especially for TRON: Legacy. It combines\nCameron\u2019s engineering with Robert\nZemekis\u2019 digital motion-capture technology used in The Polar Express and\nBeowulf to bring realism to a whole new\nlevel. TRON: Legacy attempted something not done in movies before \u2013 to\nhave an actor play both protagonist and\nantagonist, digitally rejuvenating one of\nthem. If this sounds suspect to you, trust\nDirector Joseph Kosinski\nScreenwriter Edward Kitsis, Adam\nHorowitz\nCast Jeff Bridges, Garrett\nHedlund, Olivia Wilde, Michael\nSheen\nTRON: Legacy\nGuo Heng Chin\nThe terrifying offspring of EEE and Mech Eng. Gentlemen of Imperial, please stop jizzing yourselves.\nThe line-up for the\niCU Cinema AllNighter is announced\nJade Hoffman\nThe Imperial film event of the year has\nofficially returned, announcing its lineup for the winter All-Nighter this year.\nAs has become iCU Cinema tradition,\nthe end of terms see a six-film all-night-er with the best films of that year being\nscreened in one night to test the film\nfan\u2019s endurance.\nRecently, the line-up has been an-nounced, with the critically acclaimed\nDavid Fincher film, The Social Network,\nbased on Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s rise to riches, shining as the\nbest of the bunch.\nThe rest of the films scheduled to play\nthat night, however, follow the typical\neclectic mix of the best and most enjoyable films from this year \u2013 one of the\nthings that makes the iCU Cinema AllNighter once again the bizarre pic-n-mix\nbonanza of recent cinema. Where else\nwould you start off watching Dreamworks\u2019 family-friendly, How to Train\nYour Dragon, once again showcasing\nthe studio\u2019s ability to create a pan-gen-erational animation, and finish with the\nall-star beat-em-up, The Expendables?\nThis is one of the great charms of the\niCU Cinema, which frequently puts together the most unexpected mismatch\nof films to inexplicable success - see\nthe earlier double-bill of Toy Story 3 vs.\nInception which once again saw a spectacular turnout.\nOnce again, with Tuesday 14th December\u2019s six-film line up that pits family film vs. controversial comedy vs.\nballsy action flick, the iCU Cinema provides something for everyone. Perhaps\nthe most obscure thing to turn up in this\nseries is the first of Stieg Larsson\u2019s Millenium Trilogy, the Swedish original,\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, which\nplays at 2.45am for those hard enough to\nstill be awake. Considering the fact that\nthe Union Bar will be open throughout\nthe night, serving drinks in the intervals\nbetween films, it may be a bit much to\nassume many will be lucid enough to\ntruly take in this film, but the All-Nighter provides a wonderfully heterogenous\nassorment of 2010\u2019s cinema. Or, if nothing else, it just gives you a nice night in\ntowards the cold end of Christmas term.\nThe full line-up is as follows:\n6pm: How to Train Your Dragon\n8pm: The Social Network\n10.30pm: Four Lions\n12.30am: Salt\n2.45am: The Girl with the Dragon\nTattoo\n5.30am: The Expendables\nTickets are available online priced at\n\u00a310 for all six films, or \u00a33 each on\nthe door. The All-Nighter will happen\nTuesday 14th December in the Union\nConcert Hall.\nTRON: Legacy has\nsome of the most\nawe-striking action\nsequences I\u2019ve seen\n\u201d\nction\nction\nseen\nseen\nme, the results are so stunningly real you\nsoon have to remind yourself they are\nactually the same person. Another classy\ntouch to this film is how 3D is only used\nin the TRON world, rather than throughout the movie, which is certainly to the\ncredit of the producers and director for\nnot falling prey to \u20183D exploitation\u2019.\nJeff Bridges reprises his role as Kevin\nFlynn. His older, grizzlier look conveniently fits the Flynn of twenty years later.\nHe also plays the bad guy, CLU 2 (origi-nal CLU was a friendly hacking program\nFlynn created in TRON). CLU 2 is the\nface of a digitally younger (and better\nlooking) version of Jeff Bridges, courtesy of the guys who \u2018de-aged\u2019Brad Pitt in\nBenjamin Button. Being one of the more\nphilosophical of the Disney movies,\nTRON: Legacy is a biblical tale of a God\nwho lost control of his creation and is in\nan epic struggle against his most powerful creation, his once right-hand man.\nTRON: Legacy is probably the most\nviolent Disney production to date. In the\nGrid, programs are pitted against each\nother in a brutal gladiator-style games\narena that consists of disc combats and\nlight cycle battles. The permission for\nviolence is integral to what would probably be one of the outstanding legacies\nof the film: its ultra-stylishness. TRON:\nLegacy contains some of the most original and awe-striking action sequences\nI\u2019ve seen in cinema in years and would\nprobably set the modern paradigm for\ncool, in the way The Matrix did a decade ago.\nTRON fans will be thrilled to see the\nevolution of classic elements like the\ndisc wars, light cycles and the clothing\nespecially, which now evolved beyond\nleotards with duct tape into an incarnation of a kinky fetishwear-inspired synthetic body-suit with glowing stripes.\nYes, TRON: Legacy also breaks the barrier with the strongest sexual undertones\na Disney production has ever had.\nAs if this weren\u2019t enough, Daft Punk\u2019s\nscore is an exemplary piece of modern\ncinema music. A magnetic fusion of\nelectronic and orchestral pieces, the\nscore trembles with style and mesmeris-es with evocative adagios and nocturnes.\nVerdict: if there\u2019s one movie you have\nto choose for Christmas, make it TRON:\nLegacy rather than the fairy-tale with the\nanthropomorphic lion or Daniel Radcliffe\nplaying with his magic stick once again.\nEnd of line.\nJust imagine the immense mindfuck a mash-up of these would be\n\n"

Finally, though, the club opened to a\ntriumphant first night where gratuitous\namounts of non-consensual dry-hump-ing occured.\nThe Term in Brief\nBeen following Felix news this term? No? Where\nhave you been all this time? Labs? Ah ok Not to\nworry, we\u2019ve summarised all the major goings-on\nto bring you up to speed. By Navid Nabijou\n1. Death Sciences\n(Ed \u2013 worst pun ever...)\nAt the end of term, we seem to be back\nto where we started; the Life Sciences\nrestructure. There\u2019s no need for a summary here, see Pages 4 \u2013 9.\n2. The Explosion that\nNever Was\nA spray-on-fabric lab in Chemical Engineering was closed temporarily on\nhealth and safety grounds. Rumours are\nnow circulating that the closure is due to\nthe spray containing dangerous materi-als, see Page 10.\n3: Fair Effort, Could Do\nBetter\nImperial students slammed the university\u2019s assessment standards in the National Student Survey. The Rector, Keith\nO\u2019Nions, made the issue a top priority.\nA two-week deadline for marking and\nreturning work was introduced, and,\nperhaps surprisingly, mostly adhered to.\n4. Water, Water\nEverywhere\nA PhD student ballsed-up, causing a\nmassive flood in one of the Aero labs.\nTurns out sellotape and laser cooling\nsupplies don\u2019t mix well.\n5. Dossers of the\nWorld, Unite!\nLord Browne published his review\ninto university funding, recommending a complete removal of the cap on\nundergraduate fees for home students,\nas well as a restructure of the student\nloans system. Much heckling ensued.\nA few weeks later the Government began to reveal its response to the review.\nFurther heckling ensued. Whilst broadly\nsupporting the recommendations of the\nBrowne review, the Government rejected the notion of unlimited fees, proposing instead to treble the cap to \u00a39,000.\nIn its spending review, the Government\nunveiled swinging cuts to higher education funding (though science spending\nwas relatively spared). Angry students\ntook to the streets and smashed up windows (resulting in some great photos\nfor Felix). See picture (bottom left).\nProtests and sit-ins materialised up and\ndown the country. On Thursday, the\nCommons voted on raising the fee cap,\nsee Page 11.\n6. Technology isn\u2019t Stealing Our Souls!\nProfessor Richard Thomas, of the Department of Mathematics, made innovative use of smart phones to keep his\nstudents awake in lectures.\n7. Blurred Judgement\nOliver Frantzen\u2019s glasses got pinched. A\nmad chase through Hyde Park followed.\nMuch hilarity ensued. The spectacle-bereft Imperial student will certainly\ngo to extraordinary lengths to fit in. See\npicture (bottom right).\n8. Shutting the Door in\ntheir Face and Shooting\nThemselves in the Foot\nThough science was spared the worst\nof the cuts, the Government\u2019s separate\nplans to curb immigration could have\ndire consequences for research groups.\nDepartments at Imperial could be facing\nthe very real prospect of having to turn\naway exceptional candidates, simply\nbecause they cannot obtain a visa. More\nrecently, the Government has suggested\nit may relax the restrictions somewhat,\nthough how much help this will be remains unclear.\n9. More Dangerous than\nCycling in London?\nBoris Korzh, Philip Lead- beater, Kunal Masania, Andrew McLellan and\nJonathan Phillips embarked on an epic\nvoyage to the Himalayas, scaling previously unconquered peaks. They were\nannoyingly nonchalant about the whole\nadventure. See picture (top).\n10. Too Much Willy?\nImperial definitely has a disproportionate amount of schlong: Imran Khan,\nCampaign for Science and Engineering\ndirector and Imperial alumnus, proclaimed science\u2019s dire need for diver-sity. He pointed to the small number\nof women in engineering and that less\nthan one in ten black African applicants\nto Imperial were successful and warned\nthat the marketisation of higher education would exacerbate these problems.\n11. Justice for some\nIsraeli newspaper The Jerusalem Post\nattacked Imperial Islamic Society over\nthe organisation of its \u201cJustice Week\u201d,\nin particular criticising the choice of\nsome controversial speakers. Concerns\nwere raised over the event\u2019s rather nar-row, Islam-centred conception of \u201cjustice\u201d but the Islamic Society hit back,\nstating \u201cJustice Week was inclusive and\nbalanced\u201d. Much animosity ensued for a\nvery short period of time.\n12. Slow and Steady\nWins the Race\nThese guys are pretty epic... or stupid. Mmm stupid makes me feel better about being a wimp... Yeah what idiots!\nDoes \u201cI wish I was your boyfriend\u201d work as a slogan? An artist\u2019s impression of what a dude James Fletcher is\n\n"

    "content": "27\nfelix FRIDAY 10 decemBER 2010\nCOMMENT\nThe opinions expressed on the Comment pages represent the views of the author only.\nW\nhat\u2019s the point in\nChristmas?\nBefore you start, I\nshould make it clear\nI don\u2019t have a personal grudge \u2013 or Grinch \u2013 against the\nfestive season. Far from it \u2013 this whole\nmonth fills me with a child-like joy that\neagerly effervesces with each opened\nadvent calendar door. It would take\nstrong persuasion to convince me not to\nlive off mince pies and mulled wine for\nthe rest of my life.\nBut, much as I love Christmas, I can\u2019t\nsee a purpose for it. Oh, of course, the\nChristians (of which I am one) have\ntheir reasons, and the pagans before\nthem. But in this secular age, why do we\ncelebrate Christmas?\nGiven the amount of time, effort and\nmoney most people put into this season,\nit is strange that the whole thing should\nfeel so...empty. After an overenthusiastic haircut for King Charles I, Oliver\nRhys Davies\nCromwell sought to ban Christmas. He\nwanted religion without the party. These\ndays, people seem to want the party\nwithout religion. I\u2019m not saying that to\nhave a meaningful Christmas, you have\nto trudge to church for hours, I just find\nit hard to understand why people want to\ncelebrate...nothing.\nHowever, even if Christmas in this\nmodern age is pointless, we should still\nstrive to preserve it and make it special.\nIn a perfect universe, everything would\nhave its place and nothing would exist\nwithout reason. But this is not our reality \u2013 we still have Piers Morgan, after\nall. I prefer it when things have a reason,\nbut if they don\u2019t, that doesn\u2019t mean they\ncan\u2019t be good.\nPeople often talk about the \u201cChristmas\nspirit,\u201d some kind of benevolent magic\nin the air which facilitates serendipity\nat a far higher frequency than normal.\nI guess it\u2019s inevitable; with so much\nthought about other people\u2019s presents,\nparties, and placemats, some of that focus is bound to spill over into considering their wellbeing as well.\nPeople seem to be more generous at\nthis time of the year and whatever the\nreason, this is something that should be\ncelebrated.\nHowever, I do have one issue with\nthis. People say they enjoy Christmas\nbecause it allows them to spend time\nwith their families (Likewise, they also\nhate it for the same reason). What\u2019s stopping them the rest of the year? If it only\ntakes bright lights and tinsel to engender\na sense of magnanimity in us, why don\u2019t\nwe celebrate Christmas the whole year\nround?\nIt would give me the excuse I need to\ndrink mulled wine in March.\nMerry Christmas to all of you...or winter Solstice, or whatever name you\u2019re\ngiving to your celebrations. Regardless,\nhave a most festive season and a happy\nnew year!\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we\ncelebrate Christmas\nthe whole year?\u201d\nMinced pies in June? If only!\nWe, the students of Imperial College\nLondon, are alarmed and strongly\nagainst the Life Science Restructure.\nWe feel that the planned restructure\nwill cause significant disruption to\nstudent life within Life Sciences. If\nit goes ahead, Imperial will damage\nits reputation for excellence in teaching and research. This move, and the\nmanner in which it has been handled\nare not in the students\u2019 best interest.\nAs students, we feel we have the\nright to define our university. The top-down approach of the restructure has\nignored the will of the student body.\nThe restructure limits Imperial\u2019s capacity to produce world-class scientists in a number of key disciplines\nincluding Plant Science and Applied\nCell Biology. It suggests that students\ndo not value these disciplines, when in\nfact they consistently attract students\nat undergraduate and postgraduate\nlevels. Globally, scientists who are\ntrained in subjects like Food Security and Biofuels are highly valued.\nResearch in these areas has been severely affected, causing us to question\nwhether Imperial can provide students with diverse training.\nWith the loss of 17 significant lec-turers, the important question is\nwhether the current plans can provide\nhigh quality teaching and practical\nexperience given the loss of expertise.\nWill the teaching excellence provided\nby these lecturers be compensated\nfor? The department will undergo a\nTeaching Review shortly but clearly,\nteaching was not taken into consideration when this restructure was put in\nplace.Ameeting earlier on in the week\nwith Professor Ian Owens, confirmed\nthat the basis for the restructure was\nto relieve Biology and Biochemistry\nof the current financial situation and\nto modernise the degrees by making\nthem more research-based.\nMoreover, we fear that the restructure will affect postgraduates and\nundergraduates alike with severe\ndisruption to modules and research\nsupervision. The current responses to\nthe issue are inadequate and we request a meeting with you, the Rector,\nto discuss the following: the disruption to undergraduate modules and\nto pastoral support; the disruption to\nstudents with regards to supervision,\nmarking and technical advice; the disruption to PhD students including but\nnot limited to the removal of supervi-sors, co-supervisors and advisors; and\nto immediately address the issue of\nfunding for affected students.\nIf these matters cannot be resolved,\nthen the student body should make\nits displeasure known to the public\nthrough the National Student Survey\nand other bodies.\nThis letter has 376 signatures at the\ntime of writing.\nLife Sciences cuts: Letters\nDear Rector, Protect tutors\nDear Sirs,\nI have been shocked and upset at the\ndetails that have emerged this week of\nthe Life Sciences \u2018restructuring\u2019. Particularly, the loss of Senior tutors, which\nwill greatly affect the pastoral support\navailable for students.\nUnfortunately, during my time as an\nundergraduate at Imperial I did not find\nlife easy. Several close members of my\nfamily passed away, including my par-ents. I lacked that familial support and\ngrounding which can be all-important\nfor a young person. For a long time, I\ngave up all hope of getting a degree and\neven considering working in Science.\nHowever, this year I have graduated\nwith Ecology and Environmental Science BSc, I am currently doing MRes\nEntomology at the Silwood Park campus and am looking ahead to a career in\nresearch.\nI can honestly say that without the\nLife Sciences department - their patience and encouragement, particularly\nfrom Dr Simon Archer - I would not be\nwhere I am now.\nI know of many other present students and Life Sciences graduates who\nhave also benefitted from support in the\ndepartment.\nFrancisca Sconce, MRes student, Silwood Park campus\nProtect teaching\nDear Sirs,\nI came to university to get an edu-cation, not fund research! Yet Imperial\nthinks it acceptable to callously dismiss\nsome of the best teaching staff in the\ndepartment. I think the fact that among\nothers, the admissions tutor is going,\ntells you all you need to know about Imperial\u2019s attitude towards undergraduate\nstudies.\nThese cuts will massively impact on\nour learning in biochemistry: many of\nthose let go were course convenors for\nfinal year modules which will now be\ncut from the course, and all of the names\non the list were among the best lecturers\nin the first year.\nImperial is really shooting itself in the\nfoot by doing this for two main reasons:\nthose of us (biochemistry undergradu-ates) who were thinking of a career in\nresearch will surely think twice having seen how an allegedly world class\ninstitution treats its employees. Also,\nmany PhD and MSc students say they\nwouldn\u2019t have been inspired to do research if it hadn\u2019t been for the stellar\nteaching of these members of staff.\nImperial is making a grave error in\nsacking many of the staff in biochemistry who give a damn about teaching.\nGuy Needham (2nd year biochemistry\nstudent)\nDear Sirs,\nI must address some of the\npoints raised by Mr Davies\n[in last week\u2019s article entitled\n\u201cFlee! Flee the St John Ambulance Service!\u201d] I stress that\nthese are my personal views.\nMr Davies\u2019 implicit suggestion that [St John Ambulance\u2019s\nvolunteers] are eager to defibril-late someone at the first opportunity to \u201ctry [the equipment]\nout\u201d is tantamount to comparing the organisation\u2019s members\nto mad scientists wanting to\ntest equipment on wounded\nguinea pigs- a suggestion that\nleaves a very bitter taste in the\nmouth and is needless to say\nuntrue.\nMoreover, the suggestion that\navoiding St John Ambulance\navoids \u201cthe grim spectre of\ndeath\u201d could well be interpreted\nas libellous. If Mr Davies has\nany actual examples of clinical\nmalpractice I suggest he refers\nthem through the appropriate\nchannels rather than making\nunsubstantiated claims in the\npress. His assertion that St\nJohn Ambulance\u2019s presence is\na deterrent to injury on the basis of incompetence is entirely\nrefutable and indeed offensive.\nSt John Ambulance is not,\nand never has been, a substitute for a local GP\n, A+E, nor\nthe London Ambulance Service\n\u2013 they exist as an emergency\nfirst aid service to save lives\nand reduce injury, something\nit is extremely effective at do-ing. I would perhaps direct Mr\nDavies to look at some recent\nstudies outlining the benefit of\nimmediate first aid treatment\nin a scenario such as Cardiac\nArrest, the definitive medical\nemergency, and perhaps he\nwould see that people do come\nout of the Ambulances (at the\nhospital, for his reference) and\nsubsequently from the hospi-tal; a life saved that would otherwise have been lost.\nI could go on with much more\nof the work SJA does in the\ncommunity and beyond, but\nfor fear of barracking the point\nI will not print them here. I do\nhave to thank Mr Davies for getting the syntax of the organisation\u2019s name correct, which is\na common fault in the press \u2013\nperhaps if he had put as much\nresearch into the work of St\nJohn Ambulance as he has on\nthe correct spelling of the name\nthen his comment piece would\nhave been much less painful to\nread.\nFaithfully yours,\nJaimie Henry\nChair, Imperial LINKS\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX\n8\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 10 december 2010\nThe human cost of the restructure\nThe 14 academics lost to the Life Sciences department represent the most\nincredible array of talent, expertise and\nexperience. The staff caught up in the\nrestructuring, deemed unsuitable for the\nnew department, have nevertheless contributed enormously to university life,\nbeing involved in teaching, career services and student welfare to name only\na few areas. Felix considers what these\nindividuals have brought to the university over many years and what will be\nmissed.\nSome of the lecturers were at Imperial before today\u2019s undergraduates were\neven born. A service of over 30 years\nto Imperial could save neither Dr John\nTippins who joined in 1977, nor Dr Simon Archer who joined in 1978. These\ngrim cuts serve as a reminder that Imperial is not immune to the economic\nproblems felt at other universities and\nindeed around the country. John Tippins and Simon Archer are also the\nDirectors of Undergraduate Studies\n(DUGS) of Biochemistry and Biology\nrespectively. Both Senior Tutors are\ngoing, Dave Hartley (Biochemistry)\nbeing made redundant and John Rossiter (Biology) taking early retirement,\nas well as both Admissions Tutors, Mahendra Deonarain (Biochemistry) and\nBart Feys (Biology). Such roles require\nyears of experience and accumulation\nof expertise, yet it seems when it came\nto the cuts, their wealth of experience\nwasn\u2019t of sufficient value to the Department. Alex Kendall, President of Imperial College Union (ICU), insists these\nparticular redundancies put \u201cthe very\nrunning of the Undergraduate Biology and Biochemistry degrees at risk\u201d.\nHowever, the review panel maintains\nthat these individuals can be replaced\nwith existing staff. However Dr Pietro\nSpanu who has \u2018survived\u2019 the restructure questioned whether the remaining\nstaff had the goodwill or capacity to fill\nthe gaps left by outgoing staff.\nThe review so far has failed to consider teaching within the department\nof Life Sciences (the teaching review\ncomes next term), but nevertheless the\nexcluded lecturers include those considered by students to be \u201cthe very best\u201d.\nThey are supposedly considered very\nhighly by the university too, for example\nthe long-standing John Tippins received\nthe 2008 College Teaching Award, but\nagain such excellence provided no safe-guard.\nIn fact, across the board the teaching records of the affected lecturers are\noutstanding. To give another example\nfrom a possible many, Professor Jane\nSaffell, Senior Lecturer in Biochemistry since 2002, has received the Rector\u2019s Award for Excellence in Teaching\nas well as some of the highest SOLE\nscores in Biochemistry. She also designed and convenes a very popular final year course, Cellular Neuroscience,\nwhich was nominated for a national\nteaching award. Despite being the most\nover-subscribed Biochemistry course\nthis year, there is the risk that Cellular\nNeuroscience will be removed from the\noptions next year due to the loss of Professor Saffell.\nIt seems clear that having excellent research provided no guarantee of surviving the restructuring process either. The\nresearch must also have been deemed\nsuitable for the new department, Integrative Cell Biology, a requirement\ncriticised by lecturers as being \u201cshortsighted\u201d. The department however insists that Integrative Cell Biology is a\nmajor area of research for the future but\nthis too is disputed.\nHowever there is no doubt that the\nneurobiology research undertaken by\nJane Saffell is exceptional. Funded by\nThe Wellcome Trust, Alzheimer\u2019s Research Trust and the Biotechnology and\nBiological Sciences Research Council\n(BBSRC) to name a few, it has resulted\nin regular publications as well as two\npatents protecting therapeutics for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and nerve regenera-tion.\nAnother example is Dr Mahendra\nDeonarain, a Reader in Antibody Technology (promoted this summer) who\nalso co-founded an Imperial College\nspin-out Biotechnology company called\nPhotoBiotics in 2001. This develops and\ncommercialises novel photodynamic\ntherapy drugs and many inventions have\nbeen patented. Surely Imperial should\nbe promoting business and entrepre-neurship, yet the departure of Dr Deonarain marks the loss of an inspirational\nfigure. There are serious doubts that the\nfinal year Biochemistry course, Biotechnology and Business, he designed will\nnot continue after this year. Ian Owens\nhas said that all courses will be under review when the Teaching Review begins\nin January.\nThe treatment of the staff has created a\nlot of resentment. One staff member told\nFelix: \u201cyou can imagine how betrayed\nand angry staff feel about this, not only\nthe ones who are directly affected.\u201d Another commented that they felt \u201cchewed\nup and spat out by [the] Life Sciences\n[Department]\u201d. A member of the Biology department said the atmosphere in\nthe SAF building was \u201csimply horrendous\u201d.\nThe informing of staff of their situation by email has certainly contributed\nto these feelings. Ian Owens explained\nthat staff were informed both by post\nand email, the latter to ensure all were\ninformed simultaneously.\nAlex Kendall has also highlighted the\n\u201clack of real choice\u201d the academics now\nface. They can either take a significant\nvoluntary redundancy package, or ap-peal. If their appeal is unsuccessful they\nwill only be given a small statutory re-dundancy.\nSo how will the Life Sciences department deal with losing so many highly-skilled teaching staff? Ian Owens commented that \u201closing good teachers is\nalways difficult to cope with\u201d, but \u201cthe\ndepartment will survive as it has done\nbefore\u201d, referring to the cuts made in\n2004. He even hopes to improve teaching and provide \u201cmore stimulating, more\nrelevant and better courses\u201d.\n\u201cThe department\nrisks deterring\nstudents from\napplying to Imperial\u201d\nSophia David\nA student looks on at the plant protest outside the Faculty Building last Wednesday\nKadhim Shubber\n\n"

    "content": "25\nfelix FRIDAY 10 decemBER 2010\nCOMMENT\nA\nfter a month at imperial,\nmy friends had found out\nthat I hadn\u2019t ever touched\nsnow. Naturally I was\nmildly teased as they\ntook amusement from my winter noob-ness. As soon as the prospect of snow\narrived in the form of a little icon on\nthe BBC online weather forecast, I was\nover the moon. Of course, I was expecting to wake up to a snow day the next\nday so when I went to lectures that day\nI was rather excited. As soon as people\nsaid \u201cit won\u2019t settle\u201d, I just nodded and\ntoned down the outward enthusiasm.\nOne Google search later I realised that\nmeant it\u2019ll be in the sky but not on the\nground. Sad face.\nSkip to next Tuesday at 7:30AM I\nreceive a text saying, \u201cSNOW!\u201d My\nobvious response to this is to immediately rip my covers off and, in one swift\nmovement, tear open the curtains while\nlaunching myself toward the window\nwith enough force to have my face collide with the glass. Potential facial bruises aside, seeing the little white things\nfalling from the sky was astonishing.\nI do not remember how long I stood\nAngry Geek\nthere but once I removed myself from\nthe fairytale, I frantically sent out a text\nalong the lines of \u201cas soon as you are\nawake enough to play in the snow with\nme, text me!!!!\u201d after that I leaped over\nto my wardrobe to get changed. I soon\nrealised I wasn\u2019t sure what to wear, but\nthen a flash memory of my mother\u2019s\nemail reminding me to layer up prompted me to wear all of my uni qlo gear at\nthe same time, and then some. It took\nme about 20 minutes to put on 5 layers made up of 21 items of clothing. I\nthen stuffed my pockets with any money\nI could find, just in case being in the\nsnow brings on sudden expenses. Not\na minute later, I received a reply from\na friend from my old school (also very\nobviously a snow virgin) informing me\nthat he and our other friend from before\nwere in Princes Gardens freaking their\nshit over the snow. Eager to join them,\nI hurled myself down the stairs with\nenough force to stop a bus, and quickly\nexited Beit.\nBeing outside in the snow was utterly\nmagical. In my head there are two kinds\nof snow: snow from romantic comedies\nand snow from action movies. I was officially in a rom-com. After the initial\nshock of having cold small things touch\nmy cheeks, I was on my very merry way\nto Prince\u2019s Gardens. While walking I\nwasn\u2019t aware that I had an unnaturally\nlarge smile attached to my face until\npeople started staring. Even after I realised I looked like I had just snorted some\nnew class A drug, I was too giddy to care\nand so carried on scaring the south ken\nresidents in a joker like fashion.\nAfter meeting my friends, we just\nstood in the snow; open mouthed trying to catch it on our tongues. After that\nfailed, we settled for copious amounts of\nprancing, leaping and other forms general joyousness. This is when I realised\ncrunchy snow is like crunchy leaves on\nsteroids, and this is coming from someone who will go WELL out of her way\nto step on a crunchy leaf. Naturally, this\nmade me unbelievably happy as every\nstep in the patch of snow gave a very\nsatisfying crunch. Although the snow\nthat day was minor, it was more than\ngood enough for me and I proceeded\nwith abnormally high spirits, a spring\nin my step and the same freakish smile\nplastered across my face.\nT\nhe praise for Julian Assange certainly is interesting to me. Not that I don\u2019t\nadmire the man; it\u2019s very\nimpressive what he\u2019s done,\nand many of the papers released are genuinely hilarious to read. Mainly because\nthey paint a picture that confirms the\nbest and most accurate conspiracy of all\n- that the world is not run by malicious\nplotters or fascists or corporations, but\nthat it is run by people. Stupid, fallible,\nnormal people who just happen to be in\na seat of power rather than the front of\na taxi.\nThe leak was admirable because it\nreminded me that, yes, the world is actually normal. People think the Royal\nFamily are crazy. China secretly slaps its\nknees and laughs whenever Kim Jong Il\nmakes a weird speech to the world.\nI guess I find the praise strange because Julian Assange isn\u2019t really a freedom fighter this time around. He\u2019s just a\npetty and bitter man.\nThe war leaks seemed justified - I\nwatched the gunship footage with hor-ror, and it felt good to know that this sort\nof thing was able to be made public. But\nreleasing a memo that suggests the US\nthought Brown was a bit ugly? It\u2019s hardly breaking news. It doesn\u2019t help anyone\neither. What Wikileaks has done is tanta-Lisa Ashari\nmount to reading STD test results out at\na brothel. The same people in the world\nare getting fucked, you\u2019re just making\neveryone feel slightly more uncomfortable about it.\nAnd of course, this pettiness and dedication to the word \u201csecret\u201d has drawn\nout every government conspiracy maniac this side of the JFK assassination.\nThere are people out there, people\nwho were created through roughly the\nsame biological process as you, me and\nGilead Amit, who believe that America\nstaged Pearl Harbour so they would\nhave a reason to invade Asia. These people look at leaked documents about the\nsize of Ronald Reagan\u2019s left testicle, and\nthey say \u201cIf they were hiding that, who\nknows what else they could be hiding.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Assange looks like\nthe offspring of Doc Brown from Back\nto the Future and John Inman from Are\nYou Being Served. He gives off an image of craziness, a slight zany fire in his\neyes that might make him appear to be\nleaderly and messianic, but also gives\nyou that strange feeling that, at any sec-ond, he might start trying to sell you organic coffee.\nBacked up with real, factual, existing\ndocuments, it\u2019s a shitstorm for every\nflavour of crazy out there. I can\u2019t help\nby admire him despite all this, though,\nbecause what he\u2019s done I didn\u2019t think\nwas possible in the world today. Angry\npeople who hate \u201cThe West\u201d like to\nthink that the secret service can simply\ndisappear people, erase companies and\nhouseholds off the map, make it look\nlike an accident. But a man who looks\nlike he\u2019d surrender to a car backfiring,\nwith all the special ops training of a European computer nerd, has manager to\nevade capture by just about everyone.\nSo here\u2019s the value of what Assange\ndid; not the memos, which are tedious and predictable; not the diplomatic\ntizzy everyone got into; simply, that he\nshowed just how incompetent the world\nreally is.\nNo-one is out to get you. No-one is\nout to control you. They\u2019d all like to,\nbut they\u2019re just too thick. So sit back\nand have a relaxing Christmas, knowing\nfull well that Big Brother is every bit as\nchildish and silly as the name implies.\nMerry Christmas. Here\u2019s to the Brave\nNew World.\nHave you got any secret government\ndocuments to reveal to the world?\nSend them to anangrygeek@\ngmail.com so I can achieve worldwide fame... and then get arrested\non sex charges.\nOur leaders are idiots... no shit\n\u201cChina secretly slaps\nit\u2019s knees whenever\nKim Jong Il makes a\nweird speech\u201d\n\u201cBeing outside in\nthe snow was utterly\nmagical. I was\nofficially in a Rom\u2013\nCom\u201d\nThe nativity: from a\nlady\u2019s point of view\nNo business like snow business\nMale chauvinists have assured\nme that it is my job to care\nabout domestics. But to show\nthat I am not merely using this\nas an excuse to slack off work\nand am taking my responsibilities as a female seriously, I\nwant to tell you about my role\nmodel, Baboushka (aka Babs\nin my book). One could think\nof her as a Russian version of\nSt Nicholas. For those to whom\nSt Nicholas is a vague figure of\nfestive season relevance with a\nday in his name, I ought to add\nsome explanations; it would\nmake a useful piece of trivia\nwouldn\u2019t it? However I want to\nget off the beaten Christmas\ntrack and not bother looking it\nup for your benefit.\nA long long time ago in a\ngalaxy far far away (picture\nScotland), there lived a woman named Babs (okay so picture boobs). The three kings\nstopped by her place on their\nvoyage to find the little babs,\nJesus (maybe don\u2019t picture\nboobs this time).\nThey asked her to accompany\nthem on their quest following\na star, a request comparable\nto an offer to be in the studio\naudience for the X-Factor final,\nor some such joyous occasion.\nAnd here\u2019s where it gets\ngood; dear old Babs was too\nbusy with the household chores\n(she just so happened to be\ncleaning the floor as the kings\narrived). She knows her place\nas a woman, no? That\u2019s when\nthings took a nasty turn though.\nShe later set out to follow the\nthree kings with some gifts, regretting not joining them earlier.\nShe asked around but could\nnot find them, nor the Baby\nJesus. Legend has it that she\nis still looking and hence goes\nabout leaving trinkets for good\nchildren, hoping they will help\nher search. Good luck with that.\nTruth is there are variations on\nthe theme of old Baboushka, although \u201cvariation\u201d seems a bit\nof an understatement! In one\nversion, for example, Baboushka does join the three kings\nand gives her gifts to the Baby\nJesus. Pretty contradictory.\nThere is clearly no moral here.\nMy original version seems to\nsuggest that ardently doing the\nhousework does not pay which\nwe all know is not true; it is the\nprice of one husband.\nAlexandra Nowbar\nThe opinions expressed on the Comment pages represent the views of the author only.\n\n"
