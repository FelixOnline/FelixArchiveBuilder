But Alas, not so.\nOn the day before the tour began Roman was struck\ndown with 'flu and so it was a somewhat weakened\nteam of i the I.C. fencing club that set off at 6.30 on\nFriday morning to tour Paris. Unaccustomed to being\nawake at this early hour, the driver and navigator,\nwho shall remain nameless (thanks for the hush\nmoney, Kay), promptly fell asleep and we got lost\nin South Kensington. Otherwise the journey to Ramsgate was made unbearable by Steve (I'm not a sheep)\nThompson spotting buses, counting the legs of pubs\nand deciphering school names.\nARRIVAL\nAn uneventful hover ride later we were driving\nat a leisurely pace through the sun-drenched French\ncountryside, regretting not having to attend lectures\nlike all you other lucky students. Our first encounter\nwith the French was an attempt to acquire a cork-screw. Despite the efforts of our linguist, we never\ndid. However, wine was procured and from, there on\nthe journey definitely livened up. Paris was eventually\nreached, by superb timing, at rush hour. Thanks to\nthe combined skill of Julian and eleven backseat dr i vers, we survived a hair-raising journey across the\nwhole of Paris. It was only when we had arrived at\nthe luxurious Hotel Star in the tres chic Avenue\nErnile Zola, that the locals managed to score a hit,\nwhich was only a slight glance anyway.\nWORLD CHAMPION\nA quick unpack and we were off again \u2014 to the\nexclusive Racing Club of France. After we had finished drooling over the superb fencing equipment\nwe settled down to some practice matches with the\nresident fencers, who included some international\nsabre urs and woman's foi lists, not to mention the\nodd American. Some of our more talented fencers\nwere honoured with the presence of no less a maestro of the pointed steel stick than Christian Noel, the\ncurrent world champion foil is t.(I was unlucky to\nlose \u2014 Wine taster). The fencing instructor took a fancy to our three ladies and abducted them to the\nnearest cafe. Being a gentleman as well as a Frenchman, he paid for the rest of the team's wine as well.\nWe finally rescued a by now rather inebriated Jo\nfrom his clutches and retired to another local cafe\nfor some steak and chips (and wine).\nBreakfast revealed our inadequate mastery of\nFrench. Thanks to Mike's efforts we sat for twenty\nminutes with no bread on which to spread our\nrhubarb jam. (Steve and Gordon's absence was noted\n\u2014perhaps they're sharing a room?)\nSaturday morning saw ten frantic fencers sightseeing Paris. One of the sights was Mike and Chris\nimitating gargoyles on the rood of the Notre Dame\nCathedral. Fortified by some V IN superior, the team\nset off to find the mini bus, which was eventually\nlocated hiding behind a forty franc parking ticket.\nDespite the efforts of our many French scholars, the\nexact nature of our crime was never ascertained.\n1st WIN\nJulian had by now become thoroughly French in\nhis approach to driving and a few U turns, red lights\nand anguished cries of \"Oh les Anglais\" later, we\narrived at the Cerde D 'Escrime De Vincennes. ( A fencing club located in the cellars of a school on the\noutskirts of Paris). Despite a nasty brush with French\nplumbing facilities, we started our tour in grand\nstyle and proceeded to tear our opponents to pieces.\nThe mens foil, consisting of Lawrence, Julian and\nRichard won 7-2, with Lawrence in superb form.\nThe free alcohol was then brought out (unfair that),\nwhich resulted in Lawrence losing his first e pee bout,\nbefore recovering to win the last two and so help\nAndrew and Julian score a54 victory. The sabre\nteam of Steve, Julian and Mike won 6-3 as did the\nwoman's foil of Kay, Julia and Jo, against much\nmore experienced opposition.\nLOSS\nHaving thus demolished our opponents 24-12, we\nproceeded to take advantage of their tremendous\nhospitality (expressed in terms of lavish quantities of\nfree al cho hol). Eventually we had to leave, as we\nwere already supposed to be fencing another match.\nA hasty trip through Paris (which included walking\nup the Rue de Martyrs in full fending gear \u2014\nAndrew had to be rescued from some rather funny\nlooking Frenchmen) brought us to the Club de la\nTour D 'Auvergne, a famous club with a history\ngoing back to the French revolution. Unfortunately\nthe wine was beginning to tell, especially on the\nwomen's foil team, whose opponents included identical twins, both of whom had considerable experience,( fencing, that is). Julia didn't even realise that\nthey looked alike \u2014 she was also very prone to fits\nof giggles and saying strange things. Despite this she\nactually won a bout. The men's foil team also lost,\nbut the e pee and sabre teams both fought well and\nboth won 6-3. Julian was thriving on the wine and\nout fenced his opponents in all three weapons. In fact\nhis fencing was almost as good as his driving. The\noverall result of the match was a narrow defeat for\nus, but the excellent meal that was brought for us\nby Maitre Lebland more than made up for this.\nThe ride home, which began by us reversing into\nthe car behind, included a superb rendering of the\nengineer's song, interrupted only by a near broadside\nhit from a rather large tourist bus. Steve announced\nhis changing from bus spotting to' bust spotting as\nwe flashed past the Follies Pigalle. Other places we\navoided were Maxims and Dirty Dick's. Steve had to\nbe restrained from spitting into the Seine and admitted that his great ambition was to spit into the Grand\nCanyon. The evening was rounded off by waking\nup a rather irate manager to gain access to the hotel.\nCHAMPIONSHIPS\nOn Sunday, the more able fencers rose at 7.30 to\ntake part in various competitions. The Ladies foil\ncontest was a final preliminary competition for the\nworld championships and Kay Nicholson did very\nwell, only missing the 4th round by one hit. Joe\nGrut and Julia Harris also took part. Meanwhile,\nat the opposite end of Paris, a Sabre contest was\nbeing held. The 120 entrants included the entire\nFrench international squad as well as Dutch and\nAmerican teams. Mike Burke reached the second\nround, whilst Julian Tyson and Steve Thompson\nboth reached the quarter finals, which gives them the\ndistinction of being unofficially ranked within the\ntop 24 French sabre urs. The rest of the group, ably led by Lawrence (Cul-ture Vulture) Boyd put in a spot of advanced tourism\nand visited both the Louvre and the Impressionist\nmuseum. This proved more than adequate to quench\nthe aesthetic thirst of IC students, and so some wine\n(and a very costly and inedible mis-translation of\nthe menu by Richard) later, we headed for the flesh-pots of Montmartre. Apart from the odd fire brea-ther, Richard attempting to borrow 60^ francs (she\nwasn't bad), Lawrence disappearing for an inordinate length of time (listening to a service at Sacre\nCoeur was his excuse) Gordon inspecting all p is so irs and Chris hunting frantically for \"Dirty Dick's\", it\nwas just like any normal Sunday afternoon.\nSTREAK\nThat evening some aimless street wandering was\nfollowed by an exuberant Metro ride to the Eiffel\ntower, which was judged to stand on a base precisely\none -hockey pitch and a fencing p iste long by an\nexpert in these (and other) matters. A streak down\nthe Champs de Mars was ruled out by an unpleasantly cold wind and we had to be content with funny\njokes about Richard and a certain young French\nlady.\nMonday morning saw us studying the rather interesting positions Rodins figures managed to pose in,\nwhilst Richard lay ill in bed, with some ailment that\napparently afflicted him from the waist down.\nVisit to France\nApril '74\nPARIS UNIV\nIn the afternoon Steve, Gordon and Chris were\nleft to \"do\" Paris whilst the rest headed to Versailles,\nintrigued by Jo's account of what the cherubs in the\npaintings really do. A picnic lunch on the steps of\nVersailles (which included the dreaded Goats Milk\ncheese) was,followed by endless halls of mirrors and\nstate rooms, all with paintings of cherubs, which\nwere examined for interesting behaviour. Lawrence\nfought hard with his Scottish nature before PAYING to use a toilet and we then headed back to the\nAvenue Bmile Zola to pick up the rest of the team\nfor the match with Paris University. Here, in an\nexcellently equipped Sports complex, with an entire\ngym for fencing and judo, our e pee team continued\ntheir unbeaten run, massacring their opponents\n13-2. The men's foil, weakened by Richard still being\nill and thus not able to fight lost their match, despite\nSteve's use of the foil as a sabre. The sabre team\ncame up against some very tough competition, the\nopposition having had one semi-finalist and one\nquarter-finalist in the previous day's contest, and\nwithout Roman, we never really had a chance and\nwent down 6-3. The ladies foil were also up against\na very god team, including one member of the French\nteam at the World student games, and were beaten.\nThe second foil team did well, fencing the same\nteam as the first foil and losing by the same margin\n(though winning 2-1 on broken blades).\nOnce again .we were superbly entertained, in a basement restaurant in the Latin Quarter. The meal,\nwhich included a genuine I.C. sugar cube fight, and\nSteve stripping down to his new purple vest, finally\nfinished at one in the morning, with Miss Harris\nrefusing to apologise for her terrible gluttony in consuming two steaks. We then indulged in a final ride\nround the flesh pots of Montmartre before returning\nto wake up the manager of the hotel again.\nRETURN The homeward journey was marked only by our\nbeing thoroughly questioned, one at a time, by the\nBritish Customs officials. It was only after the sixth\nperson confessed to having bought a fencing blade in\nFrance, that we were dismissed as misguided but\nharmless eccentrics.\nLondon was finally reached and a pint of British\nale had by each member of the team at 7 p.m. that\nevening \u2014 marking the end of a very enjoyable and\nsuccessful , tour. Outstanding performances were\nJulian's fencing over 50 bouts, and winning more than\nhalf of them, and Andrew Barbut (our junior British Pentathlete) only losing two of his bouts. Our\noverall score, in the three team events, was 62 for,\n59 against, a very pleasing result.\nBack Row: Mike Burke, Julian Tyson, Lawrence\nBoyd, Julia Harris, Steve Thompson (Captain),\nRichard Annett.\nMiddle: Kay Nicholson, Jo Grut, Gordon MacKay.\nFront: Chris Murray, Andrew Barbut.\nPhotographer: Roy Rosser\n\n"

Tang\nSir, \u2014 We have been\naccorded much attention\nfrom the establishments in\nthe society, and in the\nCollege there are a great\nvariety of lectures, discussion meetings, etc.,\n1. by eminent people, on\npopular topics of current\ninterest\n2. by \"professional\"\nspeakers, on controversial\nissues.\nSeldom, if ever, do we\nstudents invite ordinary\nmembers of other social\ngroups such as farm lab-our ers, miners, nurses,\nsmall-shop owners, and\nfarmers. I think it must be\nbecause they will not be\neloquent and sophisticated\nenough to be worthy of\nlistening to or talking to,\nor is it that we are not interested in their problems,\nvalues and views, for they\nare not people that matter\n(to us).\nT.B. TANG Metallurgy.\nTHOUGHTS\nfrom A.N. Other\nSir, \u2014: Recent articles in\nyour paper provoked me\nto thought, albeit most\ncertainly not original\nthoughts, herein given expression far more poor\nthan that they received\nwhen their authors first\nset them forth having been\nrefined with much more\nlabour of their mind before their p resentment to\nthe world. I acknowledge\nbefore you my debt towards them, and all men,\nwho live, and have ever\nlived and towards our\nchildren, and their children as yet unborn but\nwhose future is of the\ngreatest concern to every\nman who is born into this\nworld.\nWhat accident of birth\nwas it by which that I should be born with certain mechanisms of my\nmind developed that after\ntwenty years I should be\nfound among the elite, socalled by those who belong\nto it, enjoying all the privileges that such a position\naffords, with as yet unexplored privilege, beyond\nthe gates of this distinguished college, springing\nfrom the ben if i cent doctrine of the same, in which\n1 am educated?\nTo me this is a wonderful ponder able, yet I am\nsure to confess for I must,\nI am unable to answer it:\napply it to yourself, dear\nreader, and to any other\nperson, whose welfare is\ncomprehended within yours. 1 could not have\nbeen born elsewhere or at\nany other time, he would\nnot have been I, nor I he.\nWe are products distinctively of this generation,\nour nature is derived from\nthe whole family of the\nearth, so for this we owe\nevery man our allegiance,\nin particular I, my parents,\nto whom I cannot say \"I don't need my foot\" or\n\"because I am a brain I don't need a foot\" (is this\nnot the sense of the\nother?!). Would that the\nfool could understand, that\nfeet he so despises is himself as much as that brain!\nIn the same way he says\n\"Begone!\" to his parents\ndenies himself, for who is\nit that bore him or delivered his seed to her?\nAgain, she who bore me\nhas cared for me, a task\nimpossible but for the cooperation and of every\nmember of the state (and\nhence the world).\nIn some sense then I owe my existence today to\nevery other person in the\nworld (consider that this\ncountry depends to a great\nextent on trade), that\nmeans Nixon and Kosygin,\nas well as Marx and\nCaesar, who though dead\nhave influenced my life. I cannot measure the value\nof their contributions, who\nknows what they may be?\nNor can I condemn them\nout of hand. I may say\nthey do wrong, but am I any less or more of a man\nthan they? Do you not see\nI am as much, is it any\nless of a wrong that I speak not to N.E. Boddie\nin the lab?\nHaving seen my dependence on the state, what\ndo I do? Bow down and\nworship it? surely no! Destroy it? Never, for that\nwould be to destroy my-self. I was born in covenant with the state (cov-en ant for I had no part in\nthe making of the 'agree-ment\") and live under the\nsame. The covenant is with\nyou dear reader and every\nother man, who is born into this world. The hierarchy we see is an evidence\nof this; it serves us, not we\nit, and we serve each o th er. Can you understand?\nSurely then we must seek\nto improve the society the\nstate (and I mean too my-self; how can this multitudinous state be better if\nI am not changed?) and in\nimproving it we show our\nlove for those who follow\nafter us, our children and\ntheir children as yet un-born.\nIn this let us not forget that it will not occur\nin a day, consider that the\nflower that grows in the\nnight will perish in a day\nunder the heat of the sun\nor Juaan s gourd which\nshrivelled as quickly as it\ngrew, but the seed sown in\nspring dies, and in autumn\nis harvested providing for\nmany, with abundant\nsupply.\nA.N.OTHER, Physics 2\n(full name and\naddress supplied)\nFISH\n&\nCHIP\nSHOPS\nii CHIPPIES\nArising from the U GM held recently, the following letter was sent to M r.H. Wilson.\nDear Mr. Wilson,\nWe have been asked to\nwrite to you regarding the\ndisturbing reports about\nthe state of the fish and\nchip industry.\nAt a meeting of the Imperial College Union held\nrecently, the following\nmotion was passed without any opposition:\nImperial College Union\nnotes that c hippies( fish\nand chip shops) are\nclosing at the rate of\n700 per year.\nImperial College Union\nnotes the disturbing\nsituation regarding chip-pies, i.e. that there are\nnone in the South Kensington area.\nImperial College Union\nmandates s the Executive\nto write to the Prime\nMinister, Minister of\nAgriculture & Fisheries,\nand to anybody else\nthey can think of, protesting against this outrage and calling for\nGovernment support to\nthe fish and chip indus-try.\nThe fish and chip shops\nhave been part of the\ngreat British tradition and\nto lose part of this tradition would be very damaging to the tourist industry.\nGreat numbers of the\npopulation, particularly\nthose from the lower paid\nsector, depend on these\nc hippies for large parts of\ntheir diet and to supplement their low income. i We hope that you will\nreply, giving us your\nthoughts on this problem.\nYours sincerely,\nN. Sayles\nPresident,\nImperial College Union,\nP.A. Wadsworth,\nImperial College Union.\nWe have recently received the following reply.\n10 Downing Street,\nWhitehall.\n28 May, 1974.\nDear Mr. Sayles,\nThe Prime Minister has\nasked me to thank you for\nyour recent letter containing a motion passed by the\nImperial College Union.\nYours sincerely,\nS.F. Wright.\nPRATT COMMITTEE\nAs you may know the\n\"Pratt Committee\", under\nthe chairmanship of Prof.\nPratt, has been set up to\nlook into the use of college facilities by outside\nbodies.\nEvidence and comments\nhave been invited from all\nsources and below is a copy of the comments sent\non behalf of I.C. Union.\n\"The Students' Union has\nalways taken the view that\nit is essential to the academic work of the College\nthat there should be adequate provision of non-academic facilities for all\nmembers of the College\nthroughout the calendar\nyear, and that, in part icu lar, these facilities include\nsatisfactory catering and\naccommodation.\nWe recognise, however,\nthat for any organisation\nas large as the College, to\nclose down for part of the\nyear would be une cono mi cal. There will always be a case for use of college\nfacilities by \"outside bod-ies\" during the vacations.\nThis constitutes an invaluable source of income for\nthe College, which, if used\nto sub sid is e catering and\nresidence, directly benefits\nstudents.\nUnfortunately, experience has shown that there\nis a conflict between the\nnecessary provision of facilities for the academic\ncommunity and the need\nto supplement income in\nthis fashion. This conflict\nis particularly acute in the\nareas of accommodation,\ncatering, and general\nmaintenance of College\nproperty. Many students\nhave complained of inconvenience suffered as a direct result of this. We\nfeel that outside bookings\nshould not be\" allowed to\nreduce the standards of\nfacilities offered to members of College at any\ntime.\nDuring vacations, and\nconferences, the number\nof people using the refectories and bars increases\ngreatly. This leads to unusually long queues. Not\nonly is this inconvenient,\nbut it may interfere with\nstudents' academic work.\nClearly, the staff of refectories and bars are occasionally unable to cope\nwith all the custom, and\nstudents may be the losers\nhere.\nThe demand by students\nfor accommodation, during the summer vacations\nespecially, is largely unsatisfied due to the need to\nprovide accommodation\nfor conferences and block\nbookings. Students who\nreside in Hall during the\nterm, particularly post-graduates, are extremely\nperturbed at having to\nmove out of their rooms\nduring the vacations.\nThe use of the Junior\nCommon Room for exhibitions is significant only\nin that the routine of some\nstudents who use it daily\nis disturbed. However,\nsince common areas in\nsome departments, for\nexample Mechanical Engineering, are thorough-fares, there tends to be\neven more people wandering through these areas\nthan is normal.\nIt has been observed\nthat conditions during the\nsummer tend to exacerbate\nthe effects of chronic un-der staffing throughout the\nCollege. This is evident in\nrefectories and in standards of maintenance. The\nStudent Houses, where\nmany students stay over\nthe vacation, suffer badly\nfrom a lack of timely repair work.\nThe Union would like to\nsee the Union building\nused more during vaca-t ions, though it is not presently clear as to how this\ncan be achieved.\n. The fundamental cause\nof any shortfall in the provision of facilities is, beyond doubt, the inadequate financial support for\nnon-academic facilities in\nthe higher education sec-tor. Given this, any recommendations that we\nmake can only be short-term solutions.\nCONCLUSIONS\n1. There appears to be\nno comprehensive picture\nof the use of the College\nat any time. It is not\nknown whether some areas\nare under-used, or could\npotentially be used for\nanother purpose. We\nwould recommend a detailed survey of all College/Departmental / Union\nrooms and areas, ascertaining their use throughout the year.\n2. The Union feels that\npostgraduates who already\nreside on campus should\nhave the right to keep\ntheir rooms during vaca-t ions, irrespective of outside bookings.\n3. Wherever possible\nplaces should be available\nfor those postgraduates\nwho wish to reside on\ncampus during vacations.\n4. It may be necessary,\nin future, to provide exclusive catering facilities\nfor the members of College during Conferences. It\nmay be possible to use the\nUnion for this purpose.\"\nCONGRATS.\nCongratulations to Mr.\nAlan Larsen, well known\nCollege Block barman,\nand Miss Valerie Scrivens,\non their marriage at St.\nMarys, Hayes (near Ascot) on Saturday.\nUNIVERSITY\nCHALLENGE\nImperial College have been invited to sub-mita team for the series to be recorded next\nsession.\nLook out for information on team selection to be printed in Felix next term. \u00a9 IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION,\nLONDON, 1974\nFelix, Newspaper of Imperial\nCollege Union\nIssue No. 359\nTuesday, 4th June, 1974\nEditor: Paul Wadsworth\nContributions and assistance by:\nB.

    "content": "Page 12 FELIX June 4th,1974 TABLE TENNIS Yes, there really is aT T club at IC. Indeed, over\n70% of players representing London Universities\nteams are from this col-leg e, which probably explains the apparent lack of\nactivity here.\nAbout half - a dozen\nfriendly matches were\nplayed and IC, frequently\nputting out weak teams to\ngive the opposition a chance, managed to lose\nmost of them. However,\nour superiority remains\nundisputed.\nInside IC the club championships reached a climax\n(?) last Tuesday when the\nfinals were played. Three\nof the four seeds reached\nthe final \u2014 the other\nthrough a severe attack of\napathy failed to play any\nof his matches.\nAndy Beal unfortunately failed to play up to\nexpectations and lost both\nmatches two \u2014 straight,\nthough he should continue\nto improve as he gains\nmore match experience.\nThis left Graham King\nand Gerwyn Edwards\n(both of whom collected\ntheir purples the day be-fore) to play the deciding\nmatch. Both players\nshowed the inevitable\nsigns of match practice,\nand in a fairly scrappy\nmatch King ran out winner 21-10, 21-15.\nIt is hoped that the handicap KO competition can\nbe finished before the end\nof term. It is (at last)\nthrough to the semi-final\nstage with O. Ogundipe\n(+10) to play H. Kumar\n( + 8) for a place in the\nfinal against King (\u20148) or\nBeal (+1).\nGOLFING COMMENT Warm congratulations to John Mendonca for gaining\nhis first full international cap. In his debut appearance\nfor Portugal he defeated the current French National\nChampion 2 and 1. A remarkable feat to crown an\nexcellent season with both IC and London University.\nAlso to be congratulated is Bill Calderwood for gaining a full 'purple' for his performances in numerous\nLondon University matches.\nTENNIS v QE C The men's1st VI tennis\nteam began the season\nwith a convincing 8-1 victory against QE C at Harlington last Saturday.\nAlthough the turnout for\nthe trials of Wednesday\nwas rather disappointing\n(finals taking its heavy\ntoll) the general standard\nof play was quite good and\ncertainly matched that of\nlast year.\nThe team was represented by J. Price (capt.), D. Tunner, M. White, S. McKechme, R. MansonKing, B. Finney.\nNext Saturday in the\nfirst round of the UL U cup\nthe team face Guy's Hospital which should be a very tough match.\nIf the weather holds this\nterm, there promises to be\na wealth of fixtures\nplayed.

The flight to\nNew York could not have been more comfortable. We\narrived at Kennedy Airport around 5.30 p.m. and were\nmet by an airport official carrying a card \"Imperial\nCollege Crew\" blazoned across it. After a long delay\nawaiting our baggage, the airport official escorted us to\na coach that took us on a3 J hour journey to Amherst\nwhere our hosts, the University of Massachusetts, are\nsituated. Here at midnight we were met by Mike\nVespoli, the U. Mass. crew coach, who very quickly\nand efficiently had us bedded down for the night in our\nquarters.\nAwakening the next day to a very rainy morning, it\nwas decided to settle in after the long journey, and leave\nour rowing until Wednesday. This gave us the opportunity to look at the University Campus, which extends\nover a couple of square miles and has at the moment\n22,000 students.\nMike Vespoli, the perfect host, acquired us a very big\ncar for our transport to and from their boat house, which lay on the Connecticut River, six miles away.\nThe crew settled in the boat after a few adjustments\nand were given a set of Aylings oars which we used the\nentire time.\nMassachusetts\nOn Wednesday evening, University of Massachusetts\ngave a welcoming party for us which was attended by\nthe Heads of Departments and other celebrities. A huge\ncake was made for us\u2014of around 4 sq. ft. iced in blue\nand white with \" WELCOME IMPERIAL COLLEGE\" on it, with tea made in our honour and of course a special \"Punch\" was also available. The President of\ntheir boat club made a speech of welcome to us and\nextended their best wishes for a pleasant time during\nour visit\u2014and hopes for further trips between the two\nboat clubs. I was able to reply before the punch took\nhold and to thank everyone concerned for what they\nhad already done to make our stay very enjoyable and\npresent them with the I.C. Crest, suitably inscribed, as a mark of our appreciation.\nAfter two outings on Wednesday and two on Thursday, Friday had to be given up for the boat to be transported to Boston, approximately 100 miles away. On\nSaturday the crew left Amherst at 6.30 a.m. for their\nrace against M.I.T.( Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and U. Mass. The travelling proved too much\nfor us, plus the fact of the little time we had been\ntogether as a crew. Hence the result was U. Mass. 6\nmin. 23 sec, M.I.T.6.30 and I.C.6.45. In the afternoon\nthe lads looked over Boston and although disappointed\nat the race results were not dismayed.\nI.C. Ex-President\nOn our arrival back from Boston a pleasant surprise\nwas waiting for us. John Levy had been able to contact\nDr. A. Kitchener, President of the I.C. Union '53, who\nwas living in New York. He arrived at the Campus\nwhere a number of the crew and John, Professor Steiri\nand his wife, Sally and myself, enjoyed a meal. After\ndinner, drinks were then served. After the main party\nleft, Kitch, John and I went to Amherst and settled in\nthe bar of the Lord Jeffery Inn and past feats and\nmemories were discussed and a lovely round- off to a pleasant day was had. Kitch, wearing the blazer of the\nStaten Island Cricket Club is Vice-President of the\nNew York Cricket Association and organises Rugby\nFootball referees in and around New York. He had\nbeen refereeing a rug ger match at Providence that after-noon. What an ambassador from I.C! Kent and Ice\nOn Monday, we rigged the boat, had two outings and\ngreatly improved. On Tuesday with the temperature\nbelow zero and everything co.ve red with ice, we decided\non one long outing and then called it a day. On Wednesday morning we left by car with our oars on top at\n9 a.m. for Kent School approximately 150 miles away.\nFor this trip Hayden Thomas borrowed a car from aU. Mass. friend which allowed us to take everyone,\nconsidering Hayden had only just passed his driving\ntest, great credit must be given to him as the roads were\nstill pretty icy. We arrived at Kent around 1 p.m. and\nwere given a boat that only needed a few adjustments.\nThe crew really went well and at 3 p.m. we accom?panied Kent School first boat and rowed six times for\nIj minutes. Each time Kent would start well up, and\nmade sure we did not catch them until the fourth row.\nOn the fifth, we made sure we were level and were able\nVISIT TO USA\nAPRIL 1974\nto hold them and the last row of all saw us really beat\nthem. This was indeed their best row yet. So much so as\nto make Kent fight shy of any further racing; the crew\ncan be proud of this performance. Our hosts, Hart\nPerry, the Dean of Students, and his coach, Stuart\nMcDonald, then took us to the dining hall and entertained us to dinner. Afterwards, some of us were shown\naround the school and its new sports centre. Others had\na look at Kent itself, a quaint little place. We then all\nmet in a School House Lounge for a chat and refresh-ment s. The beer was very good.\nOn Thursday morning breakfast was at 8 a.m. and\nHart Perry presented us all with a glass tankard with\nthe School Crest and the 50 years of Kent School Book\nautographed by the Headmaster and Hart Perry. Our\nstay with Kent was really something to be remembered.\nYale and Sun\nWe left Kent at 11 a.m. Thursday and arrived at\nYale, 80 miles further south at 1 p.m. We were met by\nJerry Romano, the Yale rig ger and given a boat to try\nand after a couple of quick try-outs we basked in the\nsunshine, with the temperature around 70 degrees. We\nawaited the arrival of the Yale first boat and their\nheavyweight freshmen, most of whom had rowed at\nschool with their Coach, Tony Johnson. We boated\nwith these two crews for a series of starts and rows of\nvarious lengths, finishing with a three minute row.\nWhilst holding the heavyweights most of the time, the\nYale first boat was decidedly stronger and had the\nbetter of us in the long pieces of rowing. But considering the change of boats, plus the travelling, the crew\ndid very well. After the boating we then motored a few\nmiles to Yale University for dinner and after an hour's look around, we left at 8.45 p.m. for Amherst, arriving\nback around midnight.\nThe Big One\nOn Friday we had a couple of outings to get ready\nfor the big race on Easter Saturday against U. Mass.\nand La Salle University. The crew settled back into their\nU. Mass boat very quickly and were improving every\nminute. On Saturday the weather man gave us his third\nchange and let the rain down quite heavily. The three\ncrews lined up with U. Mass. and us both leaving La Salle rapidly. But U. Mass. clashed with La Salle\u2014so\nthe race was stopped and re-started. This time U. Mass.\nhad the better start and went ahead after a minute. I.C. again drawing away from La Salle. At half-way U. Mass. were r three quarters of a length up on I.C. with La Salle about the same down on us\u2014and from there to\nthe finish U. Mass. drew away from I.C. with I.C. drawing away from La Salle. The finish being U. Mass.\n6.26\u2014I.C.6.40 \u2014La Salle 6.55\u2014a very good row indeed\nfor I.C. Technique\nThe main comment from the American coaches about\nthe I.C. crew was that their technique was better than\nthe Americans', but strength through the water needed\nimprovement. This I thoroughly agree with. I do thank\nour two very Senior men, Chris George, and Neil James\nfor accompanying us and really boosting our crew and\nfor our 2nd VIII lightweights who made up the crew\nwith only four 1st VIII. I think the trip was a tremendous success and I pay tribute to all the lads for\ntheir conduct on and off the water. It was in keeping\nwith I.C.'s reputation of good sportsmanship. I should\nalso like to thank everyone who made this trip possible\nfor us. and to our American hosts wherever we went.\nI can only say \"thank you\" and \"please invite us again\".\nI must make special mention to one Steve Wise. On\nthe eve of the trip I needed one man to keep the party\nnumber up, so John Levy, who we have lent to Thames\nRowing Club to be their captain, gave permission for\nme to ask one of his boys\u2014and Steve at very short\nnotice came with us. His ability as an oarsman and his\ncompanionship throughout the trip was true Boat Club\nspirit. We do thank him very much and hope he enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed his being with us.\nFinally I must say a special thanks to John Levy for\nbeing the instigator of this trip and for all his help and\nsupport at home and with us in America. With John,\nwas Professor Otto Stein, his friend, and now the friend\nof I.C. Boat Club and Mike Vespoli, the U. Mass.\nCoach, who made it his prime object to make our stay\nas pleasant and enjoyable as one could hope it could\nbe. There was nothing that was too much trouble for\nMike to immediately attend to; he arranged all the\nraces and trips to Boston, Kent and Yale; he was just\nthe perfect host. I only hope I personally can return-his\nhospitality in the future, as I know the Boat Club as a whole would wish to do.\n\n"

Mr. Colin Beardon, president-elect, said\nthat the association had\ntried to claim expenses\nfor the visit of Mr. John\nBiggs-Davison,' M.P., but\nthey had not adopted the\nproper procedure and the\nstudents' union had not\napproved of the meeting.\nThe Conservative Association then said that they\nwould withdraw their\nfunds in any event and\nthe union decided to\nfreeze their funds for this\n, year as a penalty. A member of the association said last week that\nif the money was not returned they would take\nlegal action.\nIC and\nOIL\nThe University Grants\nCommittee has recommended that Heriot-Watt\nUniversity in Edinburgh\nand Imperial College,\nLondon, should become\ncentres for education in\npetroleum engineering.\nThis follows the proposals of an inter-depart-mental working party in\neducation and training for\noffshore developments,\nwhich suggested that two\nsuch centres should be\nestablished in Britain.\nPlans are now in hand\nto final is e the details of\nImperial's course.\nRCA Annually, the Royal\nCollege of Art (at the rear\nof the Union) holds an\nexhibition of the work\ndone by its students during the year.\nContrary to popular\nopinion, RCA students do\nnot spend all their time\npainting nudes. Their\nrange of work is quite\namazing. Silverware and\njewellery, textiles, cera-mic s, still and movie\nphotography, architectural designs, modern s culp ture, painting, furniture,\ngraphics . . . the list is\nendless. Numerous students also work on industrial design. In recent\nyears they have covered\npower drills, hi-fi speak-ers, cabins for boats, cash\ntills, invalid carriages.\nThis year's exhibition is\nfrom 13th to 18th June,\nopen from 10.00 - 20.00,\nadmission free. Most exhibits are in the main\nR.C.A. building, with\nlarge sculpture in their\nQueen Gate building and\npainting in Exhibition\nRoad (back of Huxley\nVuilding).\nIt is certainly an exhibition not to be missed.\nA BROAD\nLEFT\nVIEW ON\nEDITORIAL So at last we reach the\nend of another Felix era.\nAs from next issue (when-ever that may be) Felix\nwill be printed on offset\nlitho. This, however, is not\nnew as it was printed on\nlitho for a number of\nyears at the turn of the\nsixties.\nThe main difference\nthis time is, of course, that\nthe printing will be done\non the premises with our\nown machines. The advantages are obvious. Not\nonly will it be much\ncheaper but also we will\nhave complete control\nover every stage of the\nproduction (which will\nhelp avoid the poor paper\nquality and atrocious folding of the last issue) eventually leading to a better\nquality issue altogether.\nMy thanks to Scaramanga (page 3) for his\ncomments about Felix,\n(no comment on the\nother section). I feel, how-ever, that it is not fully\njustified. All I have ever\ntried to do with Felix is\nto print the articles that\npeople wanted to read.\nThis means quite a lot of\nbum-kicking (that is ak and not an 1) to encourage\nthe strongest supporters of\npeople to write their articles on time, and on the\nwhole this has been successful. The life-blood of\nFelix is its articles. Before\nI took over it had reached\nthe situation where noone would write articles\nbecause no-one would\never read Felix. All I have done is to change\nthat situation.\nI hope that next year's editor will use some of the\nideas that I have tried,\nalong with others that I haven't had time to try.\nThe societies' page was\nan immense success, normally being subscribed for\ntwo issues hence. I would\nencourage even more societies to take the opportunity of advertising themselves to the freshmen\nduring the first term.\nSport is always a favourite and here I must give\nmy deepest thanks to Bob\nBarley for the extra bum-kicking that he has given\nthe sports clubs to ensure\nthat they write their\narticles, and for the many\nhours that he must have\nspent counting words so\nthat I didn't have the\nchore. But of course my\nmain thanks must go to\nall those that have written\narticles for submission, be\nthey humorous, factual,\nboring (sorry Trev) or\neven ones that I disagreed\nwith.\nKeep them coming during the next year and\nFelix will be even better\nthan it has been this year.\nNEXT ISSUE,\nIt is not known yet\nwhether this will be the\nlast issue to be printed\nthis term. I hope to produce an off-set litho\nprinted edition in the last\nweek of term. This will be\nmainly for annual re-ports, colours lists and\nthe like though I am quite\nwilling to print any short\narticles that you may\nhave, I say short, though,\nbecause I will probably\nhave to type out all the\narticles and typing is not\nmy strong point. It will be\npossible to do photographs (I hope). If you\nhave any short articles\nthat you would like printing could you please let\nme have them by Friday,\n14th June.\nCHILE Those of you in the\nknow may remember, that\nI am not exactly one of\nthe Chile campaigns,\nmainly due to disinterest.\nDespite that, I would encourage you to read the\narticle on the centre\nspread. It is an eye Witness report, made recently\nby a delegation to the\ncountry that included an\nNUS representative. I think that you will find\nit to be quite an eye-opener.\nANNUAL GENERAL MEETING The most light-hearted\nof the Union meetings\nwill be held on Thursday\nJune 13th in the Great\nHall, College Block at\n1.00. This is usually a very lively affair, with the\nadded interest this year of\nthe rag charities for the\nnext session. The Union\nGeneral Awards and ICU\nSocial Colours are also\npresented at this meeting.\nThe final item is, as usual\nthe official hand-over,\nrather strange as myself,\nNorm and all the others\ndo not relinquish our\nposts till July 31 st. Anyway, it makes a change\nfrom the usual boring\nmeetings and is definitely\nnot to be missed. Fancy\ndress is quite welcome.\nABORTION\nThe Society for the\nProtection of the Unborn\nChild, a powerful lobby\nfor the repeal of the\nAbortion Law, held its\nannual rally on Sunday,\nApril 28th in London. It\nclaimed an attendance of\n80,000 \u2014 in reality a figure of between 40-50,000, but despite the\nover estimations of the\norganisers, the truth is\nthat SPUC is growing in\nsize in all areas, and increasing its influence\namongst working class.\nOn Sunday as people\nassembled to the faded\ntunes of organ music\nreminiscent of \"Stars on\nSunday\" they were greeted by an anti-demon stra tion organised by the\nWomen's Liberation Movement, the N.U.S. and Left groups. The\nanti-demo was small in\ncomparison to SPUC's2,000. The real importance of\nthe Left of organisations\nsuch as SPUC is twofold.\nFirstly, the demand for\nwomen to control their\nown biology and sexuality\nis integral to the Left, as\nit challenges the patriarchal basis of our society\nand the role of the nuclear family in class\nsociety. Thus it is a principle which the whole of\nthe Left must actively\nsupport. Secondly, given\nthe allegations that the\nstewards at the SPUC\nevents are close associates\nof the National Front, we\nmust be aware that the\npotential force for mobil is ation over an emotive\nissue such as abortion\nneed not necessarily stop\nthere \u2014 once mobilised\nand organised this becomes a platform for further reaction. The National Front are not interested in protecting life\u2014\nthey are interested in the\nmaintenance of a particular form of capitalism\nwithin which the psychology of patriarchy plays\nan integral part. They do\nnot support SPUC because they believe in the\nsanctity of human life\u2014\ncertain associates of\ntheirs have throughout\nhistory played such\nhideous parts in destroying it.\nThe Left must recognise its responsibility to\ncounter the false ideas\nperpetuated through organisations like SPUC because they highlight all\nthe connections between\nsexism, racism and the\nbasis of capitalism. We\nmust do this by countering the organisations\nthemselves at the same\ntime as we actively adopt\nthe demands of the\nWomen's Movement and\nfight for them.\nSPUC maintains that\nabortion is murder and\nthat it kills \u2014 we say that\nback street abortion kills\nwomen; SPUC maintains\nthat \" all\" have a right to\nlive \u2014 we say . that all\nchildren should be wanted\nchildren and that only\nwomen have the right to\ndecide whether or not\nthey want a child. We\ndo not believe that 'if you\nplay with fire you should\nbe prepared to be burnt\"\n\u2014 we believe that sexuality is an integral part of\nevery person and not\nsimply a factor for reproduction. We also believe\nthat children born unwanted or into the misery\nof poverty suffer. We demand contraception\nwhich is safe and free and\nwhen it fails the right for\nevery woman to receive\nan abortion on the National Health if she does\nnot want a child.\nPURPLE PATCH\nHere we are at the end of yet another year. (Remarkable, isn't it \u2014 this\nis almost identical to the way in which\nI began the first article in Felix this\nyear!!!), and let's face it, what difference can you see in the Union to\nwhat you could see at the beginning\nof the year. NOTHING. In many ways\nyou are correct, in that not very much\nhas changed during our year as far as\nthe majority of students are concerned,\nalthough this does not it ne an that nothing has been happening. Many projects have got off the ground, and it\nwill not be until next year that you\nbegin to see the benefits of these, such\nas the proposed alterations to the\nUnion Building, and also the new\nprinting unit which we are getting. New\naccommodation has been found which\nwill help students next year \u2014 in fact\nwe will be able to accommodate around\n70 more students in houses around college and also there is a possibility of\nour getting more accommodation which\nwe will let to married post-graduates,\nbut this is still in the pipeline. You may\nvery well see or rather hear a Campus\nRadio station in action next year,\nwhich should help you to find out more\nof what your Union is trying to do\nfor you.\nI could go on for a long time on\nall the items which we have done for\nyou, and also about all those items\nwhich you have been doing for your-selves, but I am sure that you would\nonly get bored and begin to say: \"Well,\nthat is what we elected them to do\nanyhow, so why are they blowing their\nown trumpets?\", and I would say that\nthis would be a very justified com-ment.\nComing up to the present, most of\nyou (Undergraduates especially) will be\nin the throes of examinations at pre-sent. I am very lucky this year in not\nhaving any, but you have my fullest\nsympathy, and I hope that you all at\nleast manage to scrape through them\nand on to yet another fruitful year at\ncollege.\nOne comment which I feel I must\nmake at this point is dealing with that\ncontroversial topic of negotiation. I have been told many times that we\nshould not become too involved in the\nmechanics of college block or we will\nmerely become a sub-section of their\nadministration. Up to a point I would\nagree with this philosophy but I, and\nI think the rest of this year's executive,\nwould agree that the only way in which\nto expect co-operation from the college is to co-operate from this side,\nand not merely expect everything to\nbe handed to us on a plate. This has\nalways been the way in this college,\nand is the reason for the good relations which we have with the college\nat present, and I for one would be very\nunhappy to see this situation deter i or at ing.\nThis year we have achieved a very\ngood working relationship and I believe that this is one which we should\nnurture and foster in the future.\nComing back on to student matters.\nSick as it may seem to say this, we\nhave had very little trouble from the\nstudents in the college this year. By\nthis 1 mean groups causing trouble\nof one sort or another, especially on\nthe Political front. This has made my\njob a lot easier, and left me to be able\nto deal with some of the more important difficulties of certain students\nwhich have normally proved to be far\nmore interesting to handle, and also far\nmore rewarding to see the solution of.\nAll in all 1 have had a great year\nand although I don't think that I would\never repeat it, I would not have missed\nit for the world. I would like to take\nthis opportunity of saying thank you\nto all those people who throughout the\nyear have helped to make the job seem\nless like Hell, and have at many times\nreally put themselves out to help organising and also sorting out various\nitems, without you it would have been\nimpossible to have- done those things\nwhich I wanted to do. Thanks a million.\nIt looks as though my summer could\nprove to be a very interesting one,\nand I hope that you all get to have at\nleast some time to yourselves away\nfrom college, and have a whale of a lime.\nThanks once again for giving me a great year, I hope that I have been\nable to make a good attempt at the\njob which last year you elected me to\ndo.\nYours in the Union,\nNorm.\n\n"

I was in Chile from 23 to 29 April\nvisiting Santiago and Valparaiso.\nI saw there the most blatant forms of suppression\nand terrorism, and although I have been involved\nwith solidarity movements since September, I was\nshocked by the callousness and cold-bloodedness of\nthe junta's tactics.\nThis is a brief summary of information the delegation received about major areas of investigation.\nChris Proctor\nNUS Executive.\nThe delegation was sent by the IUS to Chile in\norder to study the general situation as well as the\nsituation in the university and cultural spheres, and\ninstructed to report its findings to the IUS Congress.\nThe delegation consisted of Miguel Lombardi (FUA),\nKonrad Tiburzy (VDS), and Christopher Proctor\n(NUSUK).\nThe delegation stayed in Santiago (making one\nvisit to Valparaiso) for seven days, from 23 to 29\nApril, and spoke with representatives of the forces\nof resistance, with students, teachers and non-academic personnel, including persons who had been\nexpelled and those still teaching in the universities.\nThe delegation spoke with refugees in embassies,\nwith the families of some of the 67 officers and\nsoldiers of the FA CH air force of Chile now being\ntried by court martial, with lawyers and with other\nsectors of the population.\nECONOMICS The economic situation is characterised by enormous inflation, with price increases since the putsch\nof about 1500 per cent in the basic living items: at\nthe same time, the minimum wage is 16,000 escudo s per month (740 escudo s= one dollar). This represents a rise of less than 80 per cent over the Unidad\nPopular minimum wage of 9,000 escudo s. The price\nindex is no longer available for public reference, but\na few samples are helpful. A normal meal in a restaurant costs 3,500, a pair of shoes cost 20,000\nescudo s, and a chicken 1,000 escudo s. Bus fares have\nrisen by between 900 per cent and 1900 per cent.\nMany of the approximately 180,000 enterprises\nexisting in Chile under the UP government have\n'been forced to close down because the people can\nno longer afford to purchase anything. Even the\nbourgeoisie are enraged by the situation. Only short-term loans are available, which offer no solution.\nThe \"Club of Paris\" made a small loan recently,\nbut has made any further loans conditional on\npolitical reforms as well as economic factors. Even\nthe monopolies are unwilling to invest in the face\nof the economic chaos created by the junta and the\nreactionary bourgeoisie.\nThe great burden of economic and social hardship has of course been placed on the backs of the\nworking and peasant classes and the progressive\nforces in general. They have been persecuted and\ndriven from their work and studies into prisons, concentration camps and exile.\nMEDIA The fascists have a monopoly of the mass media\nand, in league with the ruling-class Edwards family,\ncontrol all the newspapers and periodicals produced\nin Chile. The news is completely distorted, books\nare confiscated and burned Nazi-style, television is\nexclusively in pro junta hands and radio stations\nare brutally repressed for the slightest deviation\nfrom the official line. For example, radio Balmaceda\nwas closed for six days for a mild comment that\noffended the junta.\nTORTURE All the weapons of the junta are those of fascism\nand its major weapons in terrorism. General Leagh\nsaid two weeks ago that he did not know of one\nperson who had been tortured in Chilean concentration camps, which he called prisons. The delegation can, without fear of contradiction call this\nman a liar as well as a murderer. The delegation\nmet one young girl still unable to walk after being\nreleased from the National Stadium last December.\nShe had been subjected to electric shocks on all\nparts of her body, forced to undergo a mock exec u tion, been paraded naked in front of her male\ncomrades, been forced to watch her male comrades\nbeing tortured by being given electric shocks, been\nin solitary confinement in a dark rat-infested cellar\nfor 36 hours with no food. She had been blindfolded\nfor days on end thrown out of moving vehicles\nbound and gagged. She had been raped and forced\nto watch her comrades being raped, had been threatened with violence to her family and been beaten\naround the kidneys to such an extent that she was,\nAn Eye Witness View\nand still is, seriously ill. It is very significant, too,\nthat one of her torturers was a Brazilian, and that,\none of the comrades imprisoned on the prison ship\n\"Lebu\" was a witness to the presence of two US\nsoldiers on the ship.\nThe blatant terrorism has not stopped. Four weeks\nago in the La Victoria district of San Miguel, Santiago, a working-class area, soldiers broke into homes\nand took away about 1,000 people. By April 28 only\n200 had returned. The delegation does not know\nwhat horrific methods the military used, but those\ntwo hund ed could not remember where they had been\nor what had happened to them.\nThere are concentration camps the Red Cross is\nsame terrorist tactics. They employ forced confessions, biased judges, nonsensical accusations and\nillegal charges. The defendants know that so far as a result of torture, two of their comrades have died\nand one gone insane. The charges include \"failing\nto obey the commanding officer\" when the order was\nto attack the democratically elected government, and\n\"giving information to the enemy\" i.e. the democratically elected government.\nThere was one terrorist act witnessed by the delegation which, although disgusting, must be examined\nin this report. On Saturday 27 April in the afternoon,\nthe delegation had arranged to meet in a cafe in\nAhumada near the Plaza de Armas in the centre of\nSantiago. The streets were full of people. It could\nhave been a city anywhere\u2014until 1.15 p.m. Then a police car stopped at 285 Ahumada and a carabiner o with a gun got out of the back and shot a girl\nthrough the head in cold blood. It was an act of\nblatant terrorism, intended to frighten the people\ninto submission. The blood soon dried on the pave-ment, but rest assured, General Pinochet, the memory will live on. The people will have their revenge.\nSTUDENTS Today in Chile, between 25 and 30 per cent of\nthe students have been expelled and the figure for\nteachers is somewhere between 35 and 50 per cent.\nnot allowed to visit, ones they did not know about,\nand ones they can enter but can only see limited\nparts of. Entire communities have been moved to\nother areas. Trials in Chile are a shameless farce,\nespecially the courts martial going on at the moment with charges that are obviously false and a War\nCouncil of three sitting as judges, one of whom stole\nweapons from a military camp to use against the\nUnidad Popular.\nThe junta's further blatant acts of repression and\nterror have included forced labour in the arid districts of northern Chile. We know that around 14,000\npeople convicted by the fascists of political crimes\nare now being brutalized in the north.\nMEETINGS Not all the junta's tactics are so obviously blatant,\nalthough people still have a nightly reminder of\nrepression with the strictly enforced curfew. Secret\npolice, for example wait at tables in the University\nof Chile, where students are not allowed to sit more\nthan four at a table, and students are followed to\nthe toilets to make sure that no discussions are\nheld and no political slogans appear. They cannot\nstay in the classrooms when lectures are over. It is\na malicious campaign, meant to sow insecurity and\n- doubt among the people of Chile.\nThe junta also see to it that people who oppose\nthem or are suspected of having opposed them do\nnot receive their official papers, without which they\ncannot work, study or claim the small unemployment\nbenefit. The atmosphere of uncertainty, insecurity\nand fear is strengthened by the lack of information\nabout where friends who have been arrested are,\nwhat has happened to them, whether they are dead\nor alive. They are afraid because the junta acts\nquickly and ruthlessly when a person is denounced\nas a supporter of the UP. COURTS The courts martial are being conducted with the\nThe military rectors have absolute control over every\naspect of university life. There are no statutes to\nlimit their power. Participation consists of the rector\nchoosing any student willing to fall in with the\nstandards of fascism to represent the student body\nin the newly-crea aed\" centro s\" of each faculty in\nplace of the democratically elected representatives\nfrom the Unidad Popular era. In fact the military\nrector has the right to impose his will on the universities in all respects. The universities are now institutions whose aim is to produce bureaucrats, bolster\nup the position of the ruling class, and destroy what\nused to be an important centre of Chilean culture.\nAcademic freedom has become a cruel joke. Maximo\nPacheco, an eminent dean at the University of Chile\nin Santiago, was sacked in March 1974 for trying to\nrun his Faculty of Law on the basis of academic\nability alone.\nThe junta must make the attempt to destroy the\nuniversities, as they have a long history of philo-soph ical, cultural and educational excellence, and\nduring the Allende era they belonged to all the\npeople of Chile. The junta cannot afford to tolerate\nfree thought. Any hint of Marxism must be eradicated because it is the most dangerous weapon of\nthe working class. The junta knows that it will not\nhave control until the last progressive is dead, the\nlast academic imprisoned. It it is pursuing this aim\ntoday, with so many academics and progressives\nbeing tortured in the prisons and concentration\ncamps.\nIDEAS\nOne goal of the junta is to prevent the spread of\nideas. Any ideas, inside or outside the universities,\nare dangerous to them. In the universities, soldiers\nwith machine guns are to be seen everywhere. Suddenly, in a fourth-year class in the medical faculty,\nnew students appear who, strangely enough, seem\nto lack basic information in their subject. More\nopenly, soldiers and other agents of the fascists suddenly appear in classrooms to tell the students of\nthe wickedness of the UP and the left and of\nMarxism as a theory. In one university the military\nrector informed the academic staff that Marxism\ncould be taught but it could not be propagated.\nFaculties of social sciences, political economy,\neducation, journalism, architecture and medicine\nhave been closed down either permanently or temporarily because no teachers are available with the\n\"right pol ti ical outlook\". Any mildly progressive\ncourse has been cancelled or at least reviewed. A REPORT BY CHRIS\nPROCTOR ON THE\nIUS/NUS\nDELEGATION\nVISITING CHILE\nnumber has been permanently stopped, and more\nhave reappeared in an un recognisable form. Sociology has been completely eliminated, except at the\nCatholic Unuiversity of Santiago. In education\ncourses only the basic techniques of how to perform\nin a classroom are taught. Because suitable replacements cannot be found for denounced academics,\nprimary school teachers, social workers and assistant\nteachers are brought in to replace university teachers.\nThe delegation brought back from Chile a sad list\nof courses not being renewed in the faculty of\neconomic sciences and administration at the Norte\nbranch of the University of Chile, which clearly\nshows the extent of the attack on education. This list\nand brutality towards the Liberals, the .Christian\nDemocrats, and the apolitical they have added a whole new group to the vast forces opposing the\njunta. More and more Christian Democrat students\nand teachers are joining the anti-fascist front.\nThe delegation believes that the progressive forces\n\u2014the resistance forces\u2014are continually gaining more\nsupport for their aims and objectives and that a junta with no popular support cannot continue to\ncontrol a mass movement by force of arms. Every\naction that they take assures them of fresh enemies\nand makes new revolutionaries. For three years\nChile was on the road to socialism, and this provided a lesson that will not be forgotten despite the\nforces of fascism.\nThe junta has only disposed of the top leadership\nof a mass movement, and its methods have ensured\nthat many more will now join that movement. The resistance forces are active, although underground, and\nwhen they are able to organise these potential new\nrecruits a new Chile will emerge.\nIt became apparent to the delegation that the\nsolidarity of other nations is not a gesture to political\nideology. It is a concrete help to those people in\nChile struggling for a free and just society. Our\nsolidarity is not only wanted by the Chilean people,\nit is a necessity and an important tool in the fight\nto liberate the Chilean people. I believe that every\nUnion in this country must express its solidarity with\nwas compiled by the junta and is no piece of propaganda issued by the resistance forces. In the newspaper \" El Mercurio\" one of the official organs of\nthe junta, lists of the same vacant positions have\nappeared day after day and week after week.\nDuring the Unidad Popular era, courses were\nmade available to working-class children. This practice has ceased. The junta cannot a ff: ord to educate\nthe working class. The entrance fee of 3000 escudo s makes it difficult for working-class students to register at a university, tuition fees and living expenses\nmake it impossible for them to stay there. In Chile,\nall members of working-class families who can work\nmust do so seven days a week so that the family can\nlive. All attempts at the construction of a system\nof continuing education, adult education, further\neducation and cultural activities for all the people\nof Chile, which the Allende government was aiming\nat, have been dismissed out of hand by the fascist\njunta.\nA \"prosecutor's Council\" has been introduced\ninto each university. This is a tribunal presided over\nby a designate of the junta whose function is to\ndecide on the fate of all students, teachers and administrative staff accused of subversion. Lists appeared with vague meaningless charges against individuals and they were told that their defence would\nhave to take the form of obtaining character references from other members of the university. In fact\nthis was a lie. The only means of defence was the\nsupport of a soldier. Without this, the accused were\nexpelled. They now have no job, no pay, no security,\nno future. Expelled teachers are stripped of their\nqualifications so that they can no longer work either\nin Chile or abroad and While this is not important\nfor well-known academics, it can mean total disaster for young lecturers. Some teachers have been\narrested, tortured and then approached at a later\ndate and asked if they wish to resume their employ-ment. This is a low form of terrorism, using the innocent as an example to the apolitical.\nThe junta failed to realise that by their persecution\nChile in as many concrete forms as possible. The\nrest is up to you.\nAppendix\nText of a telegram sent by the XI Congress of the\nInternational Union of Students to Harold Wilson.\nWE, THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE XI CONGRESS OF THE INTERNATIONAL UNION OF STUDENTS STRONGLY URGE THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO PREVENT THE SALE OF ALL ARMS TO THE CHILEAN MILITARY JUNTA AND ESPECIALLY THE TWO WARSHIPS AT PRESENT NEARLY COMPLETED STOP.\nWE MAKE THIS CALL FOLLOWING THE DEBATE ON CHILE AND AFTER HEARING THE REPORT OF THE IUS DELEGATION TO CHILE STOP.\nWE FEEL THAT THESE WARSHIPS WOULD BE USED BY THE JUNTA AGAINST THE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS OF THE CHILEAN PEOPLE STOP.\n\n"

The two\nexceptions are Edinburgh and Herriot\nWatt Universities, the two Universities in\nEdinburgh, of which Mr. Mowatt says:\n\"Herriot Watt University . . . has departmental variation between 75p in the\nPharmacy Department, the lowest hourly\nrate stated in the UK, and \u00a31.75. in the\nDepartment of Computer Science (one\nof the highest). Across 'the street at the\nUniversity of Edinburgh demonstrating\nrates vary between \u00a31 and \u00a31.60. However, the rate for tutoring is subject to\neven greater variation. The Department\nof Nursing Studies, paying Op per hour\nis, platitudinous ly. the lowest in the\nacademic community, whereas at \u00a34 per\nhour, the Social Studies Department\nmust be regarded as one of the most\nmunificent of academic employers.\"\nReplies from 55 institutions are summarised in the survey. Some of these institutions pay a flat annual rate for postgraduate work, and it is not possible to\ncompute the rate per hour for these in-st it ut ions. Among those which pay by\nthe hour, 9 institutions pay less than \u00a31;\n12 pay between \u00a31 and \u00a31.09; 8 pay between \u00a31.10 and \u00a31.19; 6 pay between\n\u00a31.20 and \u00a31.29; 2 pay between \u00a31.30\nand \u00a31.39; one pays between \u00a31.40 and\"\n\u00a31.49; 7 pay between \u00a31.50 and \u00a31.59.\nSix institutions pay more than \u00a31.60, and\nfour of these pay more than \u00a32.50.\nPerhaps surprisingly, all four institutions paying more than \u00a32.50 are Polytechnics. The lowest-paying institutions\nwere all Universities, and the highest-paying institutions were all non-universities. NUS Deputy President Alastair Stewart commented: \"This valuable survey\nhas confirmed three crucial points.\nFirstly, postgraduates are being shamelessly exploited and used as cheap\nlabour. Their institutions are using the\nnow level of postgraduate grants to get\nthem to work for well below the rate for\nthe job. This is bad for everyone: bad\nfor postgraduates, and bad for the University teachers whose jobs and salaries\nare made vulnerable by this practise.\"\n\"Secondly, it shows the need for\nnationally agreed rates for postgraduate\nteaching and demonstrating work. I can\npromise post graduate students that the\nNUS will make it a priority over the\ncoming year to achieve this\".\n. \"Thirdly, the survey shows the urgency\nfor postgraduates to receive a living\ngrant, so that they are not forced to take\nwork at exploit ive rates. I hope that the\nliving grant which NUS has demanded\nfor postgraduates\u2014\u00a31025 a year\u2014will be\nagreed by the Government after the review of postgraduate grants in which it\nis now engaged.\"\nUnion General Awards\nand social colours\nNominations are invited for both of the\nabove.\nUnion General Awards\nare the top honour that\nthe Union can award and\nthere are rarely more\nthan six awarded in any\none year. The decision\non these nominations lies\nwith the President, Norm\nSayles. If you think you\nknow of someone who\ndeserves one of these\nawards then write, detailing the person's contribution to the Union,\nto the President, care of\nthe Union Office. Please\nmark your envelope with\nU.G.A. in the top lefthand corner. Remember,\nto have a hope of winning one of these the\nperson nominated must\nhave done, to put it\nmildly, \"ah\"*l of a lot\nof work.\"\nUnion Social Colours\nare a lower level award\nfor those who have spent\nan exceptional amount\nof time and effort working for the Union. These\nare awarded by the Colours Committee. Nomin\nation for social colours\narising out of work for\nan RCC, SCC or ACC\nclub, and various other\nUnion bodies come direct from those bodies\nand nominations should\nin the first case, be addressed to these. There\nare, however, people\nwho just do general\nwork and need separate\nnominations. If you wish\nto nominate members\nfor Social Colours write\nto Paul Wadsworth, c/o The Union Office, and\nmark your envelope\n\"Social Colours.\" Nominations closing date has\nbeen extended till this\nThursday.\nDRAMA FESTIVAL The NUS will take part in the Sunday\nTimes drama festival in April, 1975, but\nonly on condition that it is represented\non adjudication and selection panels, a one-day conference of NUS drama society delegates decided.\nThere were about 25 present at the\nconference, and they recommended that\nthere should be an advisory panel of\nstudents to represent student interest in\nthe organisation of the festival. Fourteen\ndelegates and one member of the NUS\nExecutive were elected on to the panel.\nThe matter of the drama festival\narose at the NUS Easter conference,\nwhen the executive's decision to boycott\nthe festival was referred back. The\nexecutive decision was taken in April\n1973 and was the culmination of growing\ndissent between the NUS and the Sunday\nTimes over the way the festival was run.\nThe trouble started when the Sunday\nTimes took over complete organisation\nof the festival in 1968.\nNUS set up a working party in 1970\nto examine the role and form of the\nfestival. Students felt the newspaper dominated the festival and that not enough\nexperimental and workshop drama was\nshown. They also objected to the competitive aspect of the festival.\nOther recommendations were that an\nanalysis of all the entries should be\nmade at the end of the festival. All areas\nof d rar rta should be represented, including workshop, and a wide range of colleges should he represented with a weighting in favour of smaller colleges.\nThe NUS should advise on publicity\nfor the festival (the conference felt the\nNUS would be more likely to know than,\nthe Sunday Times what means would be\nsuccessful), and in any publicity the\nname of NUS should appear as a joint\nco-sponsor with the Sunday Times.\nThe recommendations have been\nbroadly accepted by the NUS executive.\nIf the interests of the NUS are not sufficiently met by the newspaper, it will\nwithdraw as co-sponsors.\nSCAB Elections\nAt the last SCAB meeting it was decided to elect\na Secretary and Assistant Secretary in order to aid\nthe functioning of SCAB, and take some of the work\nload off the Chairman.\nThe Chairman, Secretary, Assistant Secretary and'\nSenior Treasurer will form the Executive of SCAB,\nas is the case with the other major sub-committees.\nThe job of secretary will involve the usual things,\nhelping the Chairman, doing the paperwork, keeping\nthe minutes, producing bump f etc. The Assistant Secretary will help out, keep the diary of events, send out\nnotices to members, produce bump f etc. In fact anything that needs doing for SCAB that the Chairman\ncan con them into doing.\nSo what are the qualifications and qualities for\nthese posts. Few, in fact. Any member of Imperial\nCollege Union can stand, all they need is a proposer,\ntwo second ers and a desire to do the job. The election\nwill take place at the AGM of SCAB, to take place\nat 6.00 p.m. on Friday the 7th June in Room at the\nTop. Persons able to vote at this event are the outgoing\nand incoming members of the SCAB committee, although all Union members are able to attend as\nobservers.\nThose wishing to join in the running of SCAB, and\nbecoming either Secretary, Assistant Secretary, should\ncomplete the nomination forms in the Lower Union\nLounge. Nominations will close on Friday, 7th June\nat 5.00 p.m. For additional details see Phil Starkey, Weeks 63, or\nDave Rumsey, Weeks 38 or try the Union office.\nCro<y v teC Low* Jt rt ciK ft ft if rw l \u00a3 Aft\ncollege\nCreate\nPARKING During the vacation a large proportion of those people with official permits leave\nthe college (either for the vacations or for good). This means that there are often\nlarge numbers of spare parking places available.\nTHOSE WITH PERMITS STILL CONTINUE TO HAVE FIRST PRIORITY\nFOR PLACES. However, during the long vacation any student may park in the students areas.\nThis applies to the student areas only. The remainder of the places are distributed\namongst the staff and college officials and must not be used by students.

As the crates were loaded into Ithe coach rt\nwas remarked that these three gave very good\nFrench lessons and hopes were running high.\nWo finally Clinked and rattled down the road and\nhad an uneventful journey to Dover supplemented\nby cans of lager and one or two Newky's. The crossing to Boulogne was calm enough and we drove\ned at this time for the hostel, about half an hour on\nthe metro, had a meat and generally relaxed in what\nseemed like acres of padded black leather, a luxury\nafter ten hours in a coach seat.\nOnce more, our energy replenished slightly, we\nreturned to the school and found the 'Bar' in full\nswing, our crates of Newky being rapidly consumed\ntogether with equal quantities of Cognac and Pernod. We were willingly taught to 'rock and roll'\nsand-pits and some caught the opportunity for a rugby practice, being not quite totally exhausted\nby this time.\nUpon arriving late at the Champagne Chateau we\nwere not in a very receptive mood, and when told\nthere were 18 miles of tunnels beneath the grounds\nholding 40 million bottles of champagne, certain\nmembers of the parity were heard to ask with glazed\nexpressions if Ithey 'had finally passed out and was\nPARIS TRIP overnight to an obscure French village 60 km from\nParis where it was thought we might get some\nsleep. However this was proved wrong. By now\npreviously unknowns had become acquaintances\nand acquaintances had become firm friends, various\nrelationships being born overnight. So we drove on\nto Paris, the Back Third Rabble making various contacts with women drivers and beer lorries in the\nmorning rush hour traffic. We met our counterparts\nand went finally to the school of Chemistry where\nwe were Whisked round the department at a high\nrate of knots\u2014spurred on only by the thought of\nthe buffet lunch to come. By now tiredness had been\novercome once more and as one lab. blended with\nanother the only sounds heard were 1es stomach es re comb lant. Metro tickets materialise d from nowhere and we made our way across Paris to the\nplush reception with large plates of meat and pate\nsalad and delicious gate aux \u2014as much as we could\neat to replenish our dying energies. And so the main\npurpose of the weekend\u2014the wine. Which flowed\nlike Tartan in the Union Bar, enough for everyone\nand more. Some were seen to be clutching two full\nglasses, others just the bottle, and chicken legs flew\never/where.\nSpeeches were made by those capable (even\nNorm) in French and English, fluency mainly due to\nover-lubrication, and everyone thanked everyone\nelse for the truly great time we were having. By now\nwe were feeling much better for the sustenance.\nThen back to the school Where three lectures, in\nEnglish, were heard by those still capable and it was\ngood to see Newky being downed during these by\nthe French Profs. M. Fayard, M. Cadiot and M. Strauss. M. Strauss, his now well known sense of\neven though \"Je t 'aime\" would normally be thought\ntoo slow for this in England.\nBy now the relationships were floundering on\nsome fronts and being re-established on new ones\nwith confusing regularity. Surplus English males,\ncould be observed practising their French in dan\u00a5\ncorners only to be turned down upon asking \"Voulez\nvous danse rave e moi?\". It must have been the\naccents which were wrong. The early departure of\nthe last metro to the hostel threw in a small amount\noff confusion, especially When Dave Turner, mentioning no names, returned declaring that he\ncouldn't even find one station let alone the right\none.\nSleep came easily in the early hours and an early\nrise afforded a seat on the coach for a three hour\ntrip round Paris. However this was not attended by\neveryone, some inadvertently remaining asleep until a later hour.\nThe afternoon and evening were free to see the\nsights and integrate with the Parisians. Most man-'\naged to see the main things of interest and to sit in\nthe famous street cafes 'drinking very expensive\nrefreshment, wat dh ing the world go by. Those of us\n'in student flats were able to stay out until the early\nmorning as Paris life seemed to continue all night,\nthe weather was fine, and interest was provided\nby van-loads of Gendarmes patrolling, probably due\nto Ithe elections. Other interest was provided by\nthe many shapely forms of Parisienne females, the\nnumber and quality of which need to be seen to be\nbelieved!\nNorm, it is sad to say, was not seen very frequently during the weekend, though several sightings were reported as he dashed from one \"toilette\"\nthis really the Heaven they had come to seek. Aif\nattempts to get tost in the tunnels remained unsuccessful and the inevitable refreshment was provided\nWhich only served to tant a lise the appetite for more\nalcohol.\nAt last farewells had to be made, some tearful\nand very touching and promises of future trips and\n'meetings made, with many addresses changing\nhands. We all hope these Will materialise and be\nsuccessful.\nAnd so to the coast again, perceptibly faster than\nbefore as the boat was certainly waiting for us in\nCalais. Maintaining the tradition, vast quantities of\nwine were consumed on the return journey, partially\ndue to the half bottle each provided by our Leader.\nThe bra on the aerial and pants on the back window\nof the coach served as an indication of the mood of\nthe occupants.\nWe missed the boat at Calais, although every\neffort was made to arrive on time.\nAs the second one was being repaired for the\nfirst time in memory a five hour stop in Calais was\nunavoidable, and sleepy figures could be seen\nwandering (staggering?) around in the dead of\nnight. DT earned the title prize PA both on the\ncoach and in Calais. Congratulations from all those\nconcerned.\nCustoms provided the normal hold-up but we finally crossed the Channel as dawn arose and Dover\nloomed in the morning mist. The driver remembered\n(to drive on the left and we arrived at the Union in\ntime for first lectures on Monday morning, but most\nof us slept all day.\nI'm sure those on the trip would like especially to\nthank Norm for the work he put into making the trip\nMAY '74 EXCHANGE WITH ENSCP\nhumour once more proved to us his great wit and\nmastery of English.\nA serious fall in alcohol level was detected and\nwe could now look forward to the 'Bar' or party to\nbe held later that day. The new relationships were\nflourishing and those established on the first trip of\nthe French to IC were resumed by those concerned.\nSeveral of us were to share student flats whilst\nthe others stayed in a student hostel. We all depart-to the next.\nSunday arrived very quickly and after minimal\nsleep breakfast was taken in street cafes with a \"what the hell\" attitude about the prices to which\nwe had now become accustomed. The coach left\nfor Epernay, E of Paris by some 100 km. The French\nstudents, by now our firm friends, departed with us\n\u2014some in the coach, others in cars. The three hour\ndrive was broken by a pleasant picnic amongst some\npossible, and Paul Gee for his fluent French without\nWhich we would probably still be on the Continent.\nShucks. Also, of course, the French students for\nbeing hospitable and John Who got us there and\nback.\niP.S. \u2014They say the Chariton Festival was good\ntoo.\nJ.

The\ndetails are given below.\nAt a time of severe economic difficulties we, as\nUniversity students can think ourselves very lucky to\nhave won a25% increase. However, we ought to\nremember that not all students are single males,\nattending University, and with either drastically poor\nor fabulously rich parents.\nIf you are a married female your grant has increased but not to the full level; but at the same time\ndeductions will be made according to the level of\nher husband's income.\nIf you are not at University you are still at the\nmercy of your local education authority as to whether\nyou get \u00a310, \u00a3100 or \u00a3500.\nIf you have parents earning more i than \u00a31700 you\nwill still be means tested and have your grant cut.\nI know from bitter experience just what this can\nmean.\nAt the last Union meeting a motion was passed\npointing out the inadequacies of the new award and\ncalling on the NUS to continue the campaign with\nan emphasis on these great anomalies.\nWhen the DES were contacted on Friday regarding\nP.G. grants they informed us that an announcement\nwas not expected till the first week in July at the\nearliest.\nAs yet there has been no announcement regarding\npost-graduate grants.\n(2) Main rates of grant\nLondon University and other establishments of higher and further education in\nthe London area\n\u2022Elsewhere\nAt home\nMarried woman living in the husband's home\nCollege of education students (England\nand Wales) in residence\nMaintenance for study abroad\nAdditional allowance for study abroad in\nhigh cost countries\n\"in cu ding students at the Universities at\nOxford and Cambridge.\n(3) Supplementary Grants\n(i) Dependants' Allowances\nWife or other adult dependant\n(a first dependent child if no adult\ndependant)\n1st dependent child\n2nd dependent child\nEach subsequent dependent child\n(ii) Mature Student's Grant\nNew rate, 1974-75 (current rate in brack-ets): \u00a344 (\u00a329) at age 26; rising to ia\nmaximum of \u00a3220 (\u00a3145), by an additional\n\u00a344 for each further year by which the\nstudent has exceeded the age of 25 at\nthe start of course.\nCurrent\nRate\n1973/74\n\u00a3\n520\n485\n390\n295\n220\n520\nNew\nRate\n1974/75\n\u00a3\n665\n605\n475\n475\n260\n665\n\u2014 100\nCurrent\nRate\n1973/74\n\u00a3\n250\n105\n60\n55\nNew\nRate\n1974/75\n\u00a3\n315\n135\n90\n85\n(iii) Two Homes Grant\n(iv) Special Equipment Grant\n(For students attending a course in medi-cine; veterinary science or medicine;\narchitecture, ophthalmic optics and,\nfrom September 1974, landscape arch it ec ture, town and country planning, art and\ndesign, physical education and domestic\nscience).\n(v) Grant for Residential ' Study away\nfrom the Establishment in term-time.\nCurrent\nRate\n1973/74\n\u00a3\n90\nmax.\n20 for\nwhole\ncourse\nNew\nRate\n1974/75\n\u00a3\n120\nmax.\n25 for\nwhole\ncourse\n(vi) Discretionary\nAllowance\nVacation Hardship\n(vii) Additional Grant for Extra Attendance/Vacation Study\nLondon\nElsewhere\nAt Home\n(Students attending courses for 45 weeks\nor more a year will be paid the new\nrates during the whole of the vacation\nperiod from 1 September 1974.)\nmax.\n1.30\nper day\nmax.\n6.55\nper\nweek\nWeekly\n9.80\n8.40\n4.90\nmax.\n1.90\nper day\nmax.\n8.25\nper\nweek\nWeekly\n13.30\n11.20\n7.00\nNo. 359\nI.C.U.

Further details will be issued as\nsoon as possible.\n(6) Changes in Disregards\nof Income\nStudent's Income.\u2014In calculating the student's income\nfor the purpose of assessing\nhis grant the amount which\nmay be disregarded will be\nincreased from \u00a3100 to \u00a3130.\n(7) Improvements in the\nposition of widowed, divorced or separated women\nstudents with dependants\nUnder certain circumstances widowed, divorced or\nseparated women students\nwith dependants may at present have their grant increased by \u00a3100.

Phillips, Esq. The Felix editor is Mike Williams,\nEsq. Here the two can be seen working in harmony to attack a statue of Queen\nVictoria situated within the Queen's Tower (surprise, surprise).\nIt is unknown whether Mike's index finger in her ear is indicative of how much\nnotice he will take next year. The positions of the other hands on a certain area\nof her anatomy is open to speculation.\n\n"

Phillips\nand Kourouniotis plus any two other\ninterested people.\nPresidents Report\nMr. Sayles reported that there were\nstill a few places left on the French\ntrip. It was agreed that \u00a350 should be\ndonated towards the expenses of the\ntrip.\nThere was discussion on the possibility of moving the Union Offices into\nthe union building. (This was mentioned in the presidents report in last Felix.)\nMr. Sayles was given permission to\nproceed with the required negotiations.\nMr. Sayles circulated copies of a petition calling upon the Government\nto take an urgent look at nurses pay\nand conditions. These copies were to be\ncirculated throughout the college.\nHon. Sees. Report\nMr. Wadsworth reported that arrangements had been made to receive\nnominations for Social Colours and Union\nGeneral Awards.\nCouncil agreed to\nextend reciprocal\nagreements to the\nLondon College of\nDance and Drama,\nand to Aberdeen University.\n: Mr. Wadsworth reported that the\nselection of the Rag Charities for the\nnext session would take place at the\nAnnual General Meeting of ICU. Council agreed to his request that\nthe Entertainments Committee be allowed to continue their legal case\nagainst Fudge Enterprises over the \u00a3700\nowed to them. NUS would cover 75\nper cent of the costs from their legal\naid fund.\nMr. Wadsworth brought up the question of the Pratt Committee and there\nwas a lengthy discussion on what\nshould be submitted from Imperial\nCollege Union to the Committee. It was\nagreed that an open meeting should be\nheld to final is e the details to be sub-mitte d. It was agreed that the following\nitems should be discussed at the meeting\n1) Maintenance\u2014troubles that arise\ndue to the lack of skilled college\nlabour.\n2) Facilities for students\u2014the lack\nof accommodation for students\nduring the vacations and the\novercrowding of the refectories. It\nwas agreed though that we recognised that the extra income helped\nkeep the costs down during the\nterm.\nMr. Phillips summed up the problems as arising from a lack of finance\nin the universities sector. Mr. Starkey\nsuggested that greater use could be\nmade of departmental facilities.\nThe general consensus was that the\npossibility of streamlining the administration of College in such a fashion\nthat facilities could be allocated more\nfavourably should be examined.\nCOUNCIL REPORT Dep. President's Report\nCouncil agreed that the existing newspaper distribution should continue.\nThere was a brief discussion concerning the clashing of dates of various\ncommittee meetings. Mr. Jackson\nhoped that it might be possible to incorporate this in the Union diary so\nthat meetings could be agreed and published in advance.\nFinance\nIt was agreed that \u00a340 should be\ndonated towards the cost of the NUS Emergency conference to be held on\nJune 15.\nConcern was expressed about the fact\nthat there seemed to be no reports\nfrom the editor of Phoenix. It was\nagreed that no further payment should\nbe made until a report was forth com ing.\nMr. Sayles reported that the financing\nof the Nightline sabbatical was being\nlooked into by the Rector, and the other\nRectors concerned in the USK area.\nThere was considerable discussion on the\nUnion's investments,\nmainly due to our\nholding in Distillers\nCompany Ltd. shares.\nAfter a series of votes\nit was decided to continue with our holding in Distillers shares.\nExploratory Committee\nMr. Smith reported that the committee had met again and altered its\ndecisions on various items (see last\nFelix).\nICWA Constitution\nCouncil approved\nI CW A constitution.\nchanges to the\nSCAB Report\nMr. Starkey presented his report.as\nacting SCAB Chairman. It was agreed\nthat there would be no further Council\nrestrictions on Ents concerts. AS CAB executive was agreed to, consisting of\nthe SCAB Chairman, Secretary, Assistant Secretary and Hon. Senior Treasurer. In future the title \"Social Secretary\" will be removed from any references which allude to the SCAB Chairman. Finally, it was agreed that SCAB would pay \u00a310 each time there was a concert in the Great Hall (with Mr.\nWadsworth giving a humorous example\nof what was or wasn'ta concert).\nDiscussion on Council\nMr. Phillips presented a discussion\npaper on the limits of Council's author-it y. Various members stated that it\nwould need an expert to rewrite the\nUnion constitution and that one should\nbe called in. It was generally agreed\nthat some sort of document laying down\nwhat powers Council, UG Ms and various committees had would be very\nuseful.\nThe meeting closed\ngenerated into uproar.\nas it had de-VACATION\nJOBS\nAt about this time of\nyear, I'm sure many of\nyou must be searching for\nmeans to supplement your\nincome during the summer vacation.\nAlso at this time of\nyear there is a continuous\nflow of jobs, offered for\nthe vacation, coming into\nthe Union office.\nThey are all displayed\non the Union notice board\nin the Union entrance.\nSeveral of them are offering fairly decent salar-ies, so, if you are short\n\u00a9fa job, just cast a glance\nat the board and contact\nthe people concerned.\nNUS\nEXEC\n\"What is NUS Executive doing?\" On Tuesday,\n28th May, they had book-ed, and paid for, a room\nin the Union for an Exec\nmeeting.\nThe following note was\nfound pinned to the office door:\nDear * ! @ XN US Exec,\nHave been here since\n6.30 p.m. We resolved not\nto die of thirst. Having\nnoted your absence, we\nadjourned to the Bar at\n7.25 p.m. John Carr\n( UL U president-elect)\nNiel Robertson\nDoug Ellis\n(Westminster Tech President).\nI repeat \"What is NUS Executive doing?\"\nJEZ\nREALLY\nWORKS\nFeatured here is an old\n(1964, May) photograph\nof the RCSU mascot, Jez,\ntravelling back from\nBrighton.\nThings are looking up,\nhowever. After her recent\nrenovation, crash and re-renovation, Jez has been\ncalled back into service.\nApparently, to the amazement of passers-by, her\nfire extinguisher was used\nto put out a burning\nmoped last month. Shame\nshe doesn't have a pump\nto do the job in style.\ncAA AN A First, some nostalgia. Dark intrigue, malevolent suspicion and\nlemon-flavoured peanuts were the ingredients of the silly little outcry\nwhich was heard after the publication of the first Scaramanga articles\nin which I collated the grass-roots opinion of the time, with regard\nto the state of R CSU, into a tangible criticism which immediately\nimpinged itself on the faint hearts of the R CSU clique-soe of the\ntime. Since then the clique has degenerated from being the epi to my of all that is secretive, juvenile and weak, to being a total shambles:\nnon-entities trammeled up in their grandiose delusions, who couldn't even organise the annual R CSU dinner and the Silwood Ball properly.\nBut enough of Ron Kill and such trivia, on to the present.\nSpeculation is intense concerning how well each member of next\nyear's ICU Exec will cope with the other two members as millstones\naround his/her neck. Co-operation and keeping personalities out of\ndecision-making never have been RCSU's strong characteristics. Guessing to which C CU next year's ICU Exec belong doesn't quite warrant\naku pie doll. Failure to make the correct guess, however, wins you\na snot-lump in the eye.\nNow for a quick collation of views which try to assess this year's exec: Norm Sayles appears to have started out hesitantly and perhaps\na bit naively at the beginning of the session but eventually got to\ngrips with the task in hand. The most significant view has been that\nhe has steadfastly refrained from becoming isolated and aloof. 'Nuff\nsaid.\nDave Sinclair has taken a lot of stick during his time as DP. His\ncock-up over Mike, the IC mascot perpetuated the myth of his in competency syndrome. Whatever his shortcomings as a Union building\nmanager it remains that he has worked hard at what must be the\ncrummiest job in the Union.\nInevitably, we coast along to our esteemed Hon Sec, P.A. Wadsworth, BSc, ARCS, who has been unofficially dubbed \"the biggest\negotist in ICU\". The basis for such criticism appears to stem solely\nfrom personality clashes. The overriding fact is that he has succeeded\nin dragging Felix from its hitherto un plumb able depths and making\nit into something worth reading.\nIn conclusion, comrades, it is with misted eyes that I wind up the\nfinal Scaramanga column. A question which has been raised many\ntimes is \"Why does Scaramanga do it?\". Allegations of bitterness,\nfrustration and just-doing-it-out-of-boredom have no basis. The major\nmotivation has been my concern for the state of the Union and its\nvulnerability to mismanagement. All too often, union officers (of all\nthe Unions) tend to assume that they are God's gift to the Union,\nthough there are notable exceptions. I felt then that such a silly\nstate of affairs ought to be put into a clearer perspective for all to\nsee. In short: Gory toads have been excavated, warts and all; glossy\ntoads have shone brightly, with fixed stupid grins; but clearly\nthere's nothing happier than a dead toad, believe you me.\nEcce, soda litas ostr ea mea erat!\nScaramanga\nThe Union meeting on Thursday, 23\nMay, succeeded in passing two motions\nto be submitted to the Extraordinary\nconference and also managed to close\nwithout the quorum being challenged\n(though it was not quite quo rate). Free Speech\nMr. Lynch proposed a motion call-nig for a removal of the famous amendment 4 and condemning the\nNUS's actions. Mr. Phillips\nproposed a lengthy amendment (to be submitted to the\nconference). This advised colleges not to help racist organisations and to make their\nown decisions on whether to\nallow such speakers to use\nUnion facilities. It also condemned those that disrupt\nmeetings by physical means.\nThere were speeches for and against\nand, on a vote, the amendment was\nadded to the original motion whilst\nleaving the main points of the original\nintact.\nAnother amendment, proposed by\nMs. Attenborough, was defeated.\nThere were several lively speeches on\nthe motion with Ms. Glaser, Overseas\nStudents Committee Chairman getting\nthe best reception when she spoke for\nthe motion.\nThe motion was carried with very\nfew votes against.\nGrants\nArising out of the new grants award,\nMr. Watkins proposed a motion to be\nu GM submitted to the conference.\nIt called for a continuation of the\ncampaign for higher grants but with\nemphasis now being placed on discretionary awards, means testing and\ndiscrimination against women and\noverseas students. It also called for\nadequate nursery education.\nNo-one spoke against the motion\nand so it became Union policy.\nThe passing of these two\nmotions means that for the\nfirst time in a long time the\ndelegation for NUS conference have specific mandates\nfor the items under discussion.\nElections\nThere were six candidates\nfor five delegate places and\nan observer's place for Extraordinary conference.\nSubject to official approval by a Union meeting, Mrs. Gerrard, Messrs.\nKill, East, Phillips and Watkins were\nelected as delegates and Mr. Lane as\nobserver.\nChip Shops\nThe final item referred to the decline\nin the number of fish and chip shop?\n(c hippies), and the lack of c hippie? in the local album.\nIt instructed the Exec, to write to\nthe Prime Minister, and the Minister\nof Agriculture and Fisheries complaining about the situation and asking the\nGovernment to support the fish and\nchip industry.\n\n"

Also, LEAs\nhave powers to give \"discretionary vacation hard-ship\" grants to their award holders in the vacation;\nthe current maximum is \u00a36.55 per week. LEAs have\ntheir own various and stringent rules about these\nand rarely give them\u2014but some local Social Security offices tell students to apply first to their LEA\nfor vacation support before they will award supplementary benefit so you might be saving yourself\ntime and trouble by getting your LEA's refusal in\ngood time.\nHOW TO GET IT\nWhen you have finished your term and are no\nlonger required to attend University, you are free\nto go to the nearest Local Office of the Department\nof Employment and sign on there as available for\nwork. You can state a preferred type of work and\nif it is available, it will be offered to you. If that sort\nof job is not available you will have to consider any\njob which is not clearly, in the judgment of the\nEmployment Officer, unsuitable for you by virtue of\nyour physical weakness, handicap, or some other\nreason of that kind. You can insist on a specific\ntype of job. If there is no work on offer then you\u00ab\nare entitled to supplementary benefit for any period\nof unemployment\u2014this also covers any reasonable\nperiod when you are genuinely pursuing jobs but\nturning them down for some valid reason.\nYou should ask for Form B1 applying for supplementary benefit, and fill it in, indicating if your\nneed is urgent. The Department of Employment\nLocal Office may send it on for you, or you can\ntake it yourself direct to the Department of Health\nand Social Security local office, particularly if your\nneed is urgent. You may have to make an appointment for your interview with the DHSS and you\nshould check on this with the Department of Employment local office.\nAt the interview with the DHSS local office to\nassess your supplementary benefit, you will probably need to be able to produce documentary evi-den ce, such as your rent book, proof of the dates\nof your vacation and terms, details of any income\nsuch as wage slips, receipts for fuel bills, your\nbank statements\u2014for instance you may be asked\nto prove that you have spent your grant. Always\ngive accurate information and do not withhold any\ndetails they need to have. You may find that they\nvisit you\u2014usually within a week\u2014to make their\nown assessment of the situation.\nA few days later you should receive a statement\nof the amount of supplementary benefit awarded;\nat the same time the DHSS office will explain the\nmethod\u2014-usually a Giro Cheque cash able at a specified post office by which it will be paid; and\nyou will also be told the day and time each week\nwhen you are required to sign on at the Department\nof Employment.\nHOW MUCH MIGHT IT BE?\nThe maximum supplementary benefit you can\nreceive in the vacations depend on a number of\nthings\u2014your age, where and how you are living,\nyour savings, various commitments, and so on, the\nfollowing is a general rough guide:\n(a) If you live at home with your parents in the\nvacation you are regarded as a \"non-householder\";\nyour maximum personal allowance is \u00a35.70 a week\nif you are 18 or more. An additional sum of 80p per week is also payable to you instead of rent, as\na contribution to your parents rent, etc.\n(b) If you live in a beds it, flat, etc. in the vaca-tion, where you are responsible for the rent and\nhousehold necessities, you are regarded as a \"single-householder\"; your maximum personal\nallowance is \u00a37.15 a week (\u00a311.65 for a married\ncouple). An additional sum is payable for the rent.\nAs a rule you can only claim rent for a flat if you\nare actually living there over the vacation period.\nAPPEALS\nIf you wish to appeal against the assessment\nmade by the DHSS, you can do so by writing to\nthem stating your wish to appeal; you must do this\nwithin 21 days of their decision. At the appeal\ntribunal you may call any witness you wish, and\nmay be represented by anyone whom you consider\nqualified to do so. Students are advised to apply\nin good time to the NUS Legal Aid fund, where\nfinancial help is needed. Examples of points on\nwhich appeals have been made are: the Social\nSecurity office will assume that you have received\nthe parental contribution due from your parents\neven though you have perhaps never had anything\nfrom them; they will assume that you have actually\nhad the maximum element of \u00a32.09 a week already\nin your grant; you may have an exceptional needs\nproblem and so on.\nThe above, which was extracted from \"Claim\nyour vacation Benefit\", an NUS pamphlet, gives a brief outline of the procedures and problems you\nwill face. Whatever happens remember that supplementary Benefit is something to which you are\nentitled, it's not a fiddle.\n\n"

Perhaps\nthe 'freaks' who organize entertainment\nin the college could cater for the taste\nof the majority of students for a change\n(we're not all into Man and Uriah\nBeep) and try and book the James Last\nOrchestra (and Singers) for the Freshers Concert in October \u2014 a definite\nsell out, I'm sure.\nAll the tracks (27 in all) on this selection are even now being accepted as\nthe standards of the seventies. These\ninclude the two fabulous Slade tracks\u2014\n'S'k we eze Me, Pleeze Me', and 'My\nFriend Stan,' and for all you glitter fans\nT'm the Leader of the Gang', lis also\nincluded. I'm certain Mick Jagger and\nKeith Richard really intended 'Angie'\nto be orchestrated in this way.\nThis must be the record to have at all\nyour parties this summer, even if you\ndo have volumes one to fifteen already.\nHowever, for people just starting a James Last collection, I have a slight\npreference for 'Non Stop Dancing Volume Ten', which includes 'Na Na Hey\nHey Kiss Him Goodbye,' and that other\nsuper 'rave from the grave' \u2014 'Geh\nAite, Schau, Mi Net So Teppert An'.\nK.J. G. C14 A OLA Ak|. WHITNEY\nStreetwalkers\nRoger Chapman and Charlie Whitney were vocalist and guitarist respectively with the now defunct Family and\niit was almost inevitable that their first\nalbum as Chapman : Whitney would\nbe almost like a Family remake.\nThis is not quite so. \"Streetwalkers\",\nthe album in question, does, to a certain extent, have a \"Family\" feel about\nit, but not so much as to make you\nthink that it is just them.\nOn looking through the lyric sheet\nyou find that most of them refer to\nwhat could be regarded as streetwalkers\n\u2014 prostitutes, dirty old man, former\nbeauty queen\u2014whether they are intended to be a reflection on today's society\nI don't know. None of them could be\nregarded as happy songs.\nRoger sounds as though he has been\ntaking an extended mouthwash. A lot\nof the harshness he had with Family\nseems to have disappeared leaving a very clear, distinct voice which gives\ngreat feeling to the lyrics.\nCharlie's guitar work is steady\nenough. Not flashy, not too outstanding but technically perfect, and quite\ncapable of coming into its own when\nnecessary.\nIt is Roger's vocals, however, that\nare the highlight of this really excellent\nalbum. It is really a shame that so few\nalbums of this quality are produced.\nTHREE\nMAN ARMY\nThree Man\nArmy Two\nContaining former members of Gun.\nParrish & Gurvitz and the Jeff Beck\nGroup one would obviously expect\nThree Man Army's new album \"Three\nMan Army Two\" to contain really\nheavy rock and this is exactly what you\nget.\nOutstanding on this album is the\nguitar work of Adrian Curtis, playing\nlead and slide. Track two. \"Today\",\nwritten by himself is a prime example.\nIt is laid back just to the right amount\nso that it doesn't overpower the remainder of i he band, and this is so throughout the album. Curtis has also managed\nto write some really excellent music\nlike \"Space in the Place\". Full backing\ntreatment is given to this with strings\nand piano, producing a sound very\nsimilar to the Electric Light Orchestra.\nThere are several mood changes on\nthis album, the first two tracks on side\n2 showing this to the full. The first is\nvery hard driving, extremely fast in s tru mental, showing Curtis' guitar work and\nTony Newman's drumming. Track two\nis much more flowing, easy going.\nString and horn backings again, with\nvocal support from Doris Troy and\nMadelin Bell, leading to a \"switch-off\"\nfade-out and straight into another dr iv ing, attacking number in which Paul\nGurvitz's bass work is allowed more\nprominence.\nThe production work, by the band\nand Cyrano, is also very good. Throughout the album no one instrument is\nallowed to completely drown out any of\nthe backing. Very well mixed and a pleasure to listen to.\nA really good album and they should\ndo well for themselves. They certainly\ndeserve to with this album.\nBUCKLEY\nTon to Well, well, and people wonder why\nirn re is a vinyl and cardboard shortage.\nThe reason is because it is wasted on\nalbums like this one. \"Set'roni a\" by\nTim Buckley.\nCrooning, as if trying to do very bad\nimitations of Tom Jones and Frank\nIfield at the same time, he has managed to produce 37 minutes and 55 seconds (as supplied by the record cover)\nof quite un forget able music. Unforgetable due to its atrocity.\nPortsmouth Sinfonia, famous for\nthrowing out musicians when they can\nplay their instruments, ought to take\nhim on as a permanent member, though\nhe'd probably put the rest out of work.\nFinal comment: avoid it like the plague and the clap combined.\nTHEATRE\nSHAW\nKing; What must be the most unusual rendering of the Arthurian legends is presently showing alt the Shaw Theatre,\nEuston Road. It is in the form of a light-hearted musical (?!) comedy cal-led, simply, \"The King,\" (by David\nCregan), and revolves mainly around\nthe sex-life (or lack of it from Arthur)\nof the knights in the legends.\nGeoffrey Hutchings. as Arthur gives\nan excellent rendering and is ably supported by the other leading players (Jon\nParker as Merlin, Neil McCaul as\nLauncelot, Alison Steadiman as Guinevere). The remaining 16 supporting\nplayers are not at all outstanding excepting the archbishop, played by\nCharles McKeown, who could easily\ndouble for Marty Feldman.\nThe play tries to show that the troubles experienced in Arthur's time stemmed from the fact that he was sexually\nincapable. This leads to Launcelot being\nportrayed not just as Guinevere's lover\nbut as a compulsive nec no philia c, and\nArthur being unsuccessfully seduced by\nMorgan le Fay (Elizabeth Ward) portrayed as an under sexed redheaded sex\nbomb.\nWhat made the play were the sets,\ndesigned by Tim Goodehild. A basically bare, sloped stage with simple\nprops (throne, round table, bed) being\nmoved on and off behind fairy-tale\ncanvasses lowered onto the stage. These\nwere excellent and it was unfortunate\nthat the play was not up to the sets.\nThey have inserted a crowd puller in\nthe form of a full frontal nudity scene\nbetween Launcelot and a female,\nElaine (Joanna Tope) after having had\nan unsuccessful bed session. Well, I suppose there had to be some point of\ninterest in the play.\nA light-hearted play, good for a laugh or two, but not exactly the most\nenthralling piece on the London stage\nNote: Due to bad reviews from the\ncritics, Shaw theatre have now made\nentrance free for this play.\nBOOKS ANTHONY\nARBLASTER\n. came mic Freedom\nThis book, written on request from\nthe Council for Academic Freedom, is\nessentially an attack on the present\nhier arch al structure of tertiary educational institutions, with emphasis on the\nuniversity sector. The author correlates the authoritarian trends in society with the repressive measures which\nappear to be becoming more frequently taken against both dissenting staff\nand students. We all support academic\nfreedom, says Arblaster, but freedom\nfor whom?\n\"Some have been quick to cry out\nin defence of academic freedom when\nprofessors, or MPs, have been shouted\ndown, or even simply heckled, by student audiences, but they have remained\nsilent when radical or dissident staff\nhave been victimised or have lost their\njobs\u2014a much more serious penalty.\"\nBy the use of many case histories this\nbook shows that, or attempts to show,\nthat academic freedom is being strangled by, or abused by, the senior academics and administrators by their\nrefusal to listen to suggestions or demands from radical staff or students.\nHe maintains that the arrogance of\nthese men leaves little room for debate\nabout the proper methods of learning.\nHe gives Sir Michael Swann, the former\nVice-Chancellor of Edinburgh, as an\nexample of one of these men, and one\ncan only bring to mind the lack of\nrespect for him of his students.\nThis book pays little attention to the\nstudent who wants to be educated to\na particular profession such as engineering. The author recognises none of\nthe benefits which may be derived from\na connection with industry, for example,\nand only stresses the dangers of such\narrangements. He decries absolutely the\nacceptance of Ministry of Defence\ngrants (Heriot-Watt receives very little\nfrom the M.o.D.e. g. \u00a310,000 under the\ndirection of Mr. A.N. Dickson, Dept.\nof Mech. Eng.).\nDespite, or because of this, depending on your point of view, the left wing\nbias of this book it is an excellent\ndocumentation of academic suppression\nin the last few years and provides a penetrating analysis of many of the\nproblems in the universities and colleges\ntoday.
