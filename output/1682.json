The logic\nbehind the lifestyle choice\nEver wondered why your friends are opting out of the midnight chicken nugget run? Wonder no longer - a Felix\nEditor has irritatingly questioned her friends about their eating habits so that you don\u2019t have to...\nFOOD\nAlice Davage\nFood Editor\nA\ns a very keen\nmeat-eater, I\nhave always\nfound it hard\nto relate to vegetarians.\nI grew up as part of a\nhousehold who rarely\nate a vegetarian meal.\nWhile eating out, I once\nwitnessed my sister requesting her steak as rare\nas the chef can legally\ncook it. The smell of burgers at the campus Farmers\u2019\nMarket almost makes\nme drool, causing me to\nresent my pre-prepared\nsalad. Simply put, I don\u2019t\nplan on giving up eating\nmeat anytime soon. The\nthought is scary; I would\ncrave the taste too much.\nI am therefore forever\nimpressed by the people\nwho manage to make\nsuch a dramatic lifestyle\nchange and endeavour to\ndiscover why they chose\nto. Over time, through\ndiscussions with friends,\nI have learned that there\nare many diverse reasons\npeople are/become a vegetarian and am constantly\nsurprised when I uncover\na new one. So, I sent out\na bunch of surveys to\nvegetarian friends to quiz\nthem about their reasoning and ask about any\nhurdles they faced (or are\nperhaps still facing) along\nthe way. This article is a\nsummary of the feedback\nI received and focuses\non people who chose to\ngive up eating meat, as\nopposed to having been\nvegetarians since birth\n(usually for religious or\ncultural reasons). To the\npeople I pestered to fill\nthese out: thanks for being\nsuch good sports \u2013 you\u2019re\ngreat.\nEnvironment\nThe most consistent\nreason people became\nvegetarian, everyone I\nquizzedmentionedit,isthe\nenvironment. Considering\nthat the vast majority are\nImperial students and thus\nlikely to be more aware of\nenvironmental issues than\nthe average person, this\nis not entirely surprising\nand probably not representative of humanity as\na whole. A wish to reduce\ntheir carbon-footprint\nby removing animals,\nparticularly red meat\nsuch as beef, from their\ndiets, is a major driver.\nAnimal husbandry uses\nfar more resources than\n\u201cReducing\ntheir carbon-footprint by\nremoving\nanimals from\ntheir diets is a\nmajor driver\u201d\ncrop farming, including\nenergy, land, and water.\nIn the long term, plant-based diets are therefore\nfar more sustainable and\nwill help reduce the rate\nat which the planet is\nspiralling into climatic\ndisaster. Vast energy\nusage is unfortunately\na by-product of modern\nlife, and is in many ways\nlogistically difficult to cut\ndown on. However, we do\nnot need to be wasting so\nmuch energy on food pro-duction, because animal\nhusbandry is entirely\navoidable. After all, some\ncultures and religions\nhave been doing it for\nmillennia.\nHealth\nOthers chose to change\ntheir diets due to health\nbenefits. One person\nmentioned that eating\nmeat simply doesn\u2019t\n\u201cagree\u201d with their body\nand switching to a plant-based diet has helped\nalleviate their problems.\nThe omission of meat and\nfish from their diets has\nforced others to be more\ncreative and re-structure\ntheir meals around this.\nAs a result of shaking up\nhabits, people think about\nwhat they are eating more\nand make a conscious\neffort to ensure that the\nfood they are preparing\nis nutritionally balanced,\npossibly more so than\nbefore they became vege-tarian. In answer to those\nof you who frequently ask\n(I have been told) \u201cbut\nwhat about protein?\u201d, it\u2019s\nactually easier to eat the\nrecommended amount\nthan you might think: a\nserving of chickpeas for\nexample, contains almost\nhalf of the protein an\naverage adult requires\nper day. And of course, to\nfill themselves up people\noften end up munching on\nmore vegetables, which is\nrarely a bad thing health\nwise (cheap too)!\nAnimal Welfare\nSome people simply\ndon\u2019t like killing animals.\nThe food industry has\ntried to increase the\nquality of life of livestock\nthrough initiatives such\nas \u201cFree Range\u201d, but this\nonly works to an extent;\nthey are still being raised\nto ultimately satisfy our\ndesire to eat meat, which\nmany consider unethical.\nThere is an argument that\nanimals eat animals (ex-cluding herbivores), and\nso humans are \u201cnatural\u201d\nin this regard. However,\nwe consider ourselves\n\u201csuperior\u201d to other organisms due to our capacity\nto think critically and\nhave feelings such as\ncompassion driving our\nactions. If this is the case,\nthen we should be able\nto reason with ourselves\nand overcome the instinct\nto eat meat that many\nanimals possess, leading\nthem to hunt and kill other\nanimals.\nFinal Thoughts\nInitially, the plan for\nthis article was to explore\nsome of the reasons why\npeople choose to be vegetarian using information\nand opinions from the\nsurveys I sent out; I am\nsure that this topic could\nbe taken into further\ndepth and I have merely\nskimmed the tip of an\niceberg here. This was\nnever meant to be a piece\nof propaganda designed to\nconvert meat-eaters into\nvegetarians, which is an\nulterior motive that I fear\npeople may accuse a vegetarian writer of having.\nHowever, I have found\nsome of these arguments\nrather compelling and on\nreflection I might try and\ncut down on my own meat\nconsumption. I certainly\ndon\u2019t plan to go cold\nturkey (excuse the pun) or\never completely become\nvegetarian for that matter.\nBut I have been informed\nthat practising vegetar-ianism, at least in the\nUK, is fairly easy, mainly\ndue to good substitutes\nsuch as Quorn and Linda\nMcCartney products (that\napparently some people\nprefer), and because lots\nof restaurants have a\nfew vegetarian options\non the menu nowadays.\nPersonally, I am a fan of\nthe cheap and easy supermarket frozen veggie\nburgers, for example\nIndian-spiced spinach\nand lentil. If eating these\ninstead of \u201creal\u201d burgers\nmore often can help slow\ndown climate change\nwhile simultaneously sustaining my bank balance,\nthen hey, why not?\nDon\u2019t these fruit and veg baskets look yummy... Nah? I\u2019d rather have a burger too // Flickr/just1snap\n\n"

Ruins is a breakup\nalbum so pure and candid\nit\u2019ll have you crying into\nyour ice cream about\nheartache that hasn\u2019t even\nhappened yet. The work\nis anything but stripped\nback \u2013 as with any of\nFirst Aid Kit\u2019s albums the\nproduced, polished vocals\nare the star of the show.\nJohanna and Klara\nS\u00f6derberg use their\nwell-loved accessories\nof camp-fire guitar and\nsynth, but add a twist\nof more keyboard and\nbass, setting tracks in\nthis album apart from\nany other. Written while\nvocalist/guitarist Klara\nwas mourning the end of\na relationship, Ruins is\nbeautifully bitter, a reflection on, what hindsight\nshows was, an inevitable\nending.\nThe album opens with\nthe tinny keyboard riff\nof \u2018Rebel Heart\u2019, quickly\nproviding a sinister\nbacking for the frustrated\nvocals. \u201cWhy do I keep\ndreaming of you? / Is it\nall because of my rebel\nheart?\u201d. The repetitive\nrhythm feels reluctant\nand pained. This senti-ment, that Klara should\nknow better and be able\nto control her emotions,\npermeates the whole\nalbum. On Fleetwood\nMac-meets-ABBA \u2018It\u2019s\na Shame\u2019, she confesses\nalong on a lamenting 50s\nwaltz with 80s guitar and\nkeyboards. \u201cWhy do I do\nthis to myself every time?\nI know the way it ends.\u201d\nThe self-berating\ncontinues on \u2018Postcard\u2019\n\u201cI went and broke my\nown goddamned heart\u201d.\nThe jaunty percussion\nmirrors more constructive\nreflection. It is difficult to\nlet go, and some connection is yearned for, albeit\nsnarkily. \u201cSend me a line\nto everything you\u2019ve left\nbehind\u201d. The album was\nrecorded in Portland and\nthe American influence\nis clear, especially on the\nplucked strings of \u2018To\nLive a Life\u2019; even the\naccents become more\nAmerican, and Klara is\n\u201con the interstate drinking\ncheap wine\u201d with gloomy\nsynth. The band\u2019s Swedish\nfolk-pop roots are back\non the bouncy \u2018Wild\nSweet Love\u2019 and warbling\n\u2018Distant Star\u2019. Title track\n\u2018Ruins\u2019 is perhaps the\nsingle closest to previous\nalbum Stay Gold, but with\na tone too defeated. \u2018Hem\nof Her Dress\u2019 starts to\nbring resolution, with a\nfolky almost-acapella la-la\nsingalong and applause\nto finish. Finally, the\nexhausted \u2018Nothing Has\nto Be True\u2019 delivers final\nmourns: \u201cOh, I thought\nyou were home\u201d and\nbrings closure in the form\nof a percussion crescendo,\nbringing a cathartic end to\na well contained body of\nwork.\nToday\u2019s Empires, Tomorrow\u2019s Ashes is still relevant\nM\na r g a r e t\nT h a t c h e r\nf a m o u s l y\nr e f e r r e d\nto herself as practicing\n\u201cconviction politics\u201d in\nthe months before her\n1979 rise to the office of\nPrime Minister. She holds\nno candle to Winnipegbased thrash-punk band\nPropagandhi, an all-vegan\nband so dedicated to\nenvironmentalism that\nthey organize tours to\nminimize their carbon\nfootprint. But it\u2019s not all\nkale and tofu; the group\nis staunchly committed\nto hands-on activism for\na number of anarchist and\nradical-Left causes, donating songwriting prizes\nto humanitarian projects\nand filling their lyrics with\nanticapitalist, anti-impe-rialist sentiments. Eat it,\nMaggie.\nThe band released its\nseminal work, Today\u2019s\nEmpires, Tomorrow\u2019s\nAshes, on February 6,\n2001 \u2013 17 years old in the\nnext two weeks. Thematically, the album centers\naround American cultural\nhegemony in the wake of\nthe Cold War, taking the\nposition that cracks in\nthe foundation of power\nimply an inevitability\nto the crumbling of the\nempire. This is prescient:\nundoubtedly the image\nof American society has\ndeclined in recent years\n(with the presidencies of\nBush and Trump being\nno help for the country\u2019s\nreputation and consequent\ninfluence in the world\nat large, especially with\nrespect to social values\nand political mores).\nWith domestic issues\nfrom the opioid epidemic\nto stagnant wages, and\nAgent Orange being the\nface of American diplo-macy, the US finds itself\ntaking more and more of\na backseat role in world\naffairs, a far fall from the\ninfluence once wielded.\nToday\u2019s Empires,\nTomorrow\u2019s Ashes point\nfingers at the dark underside of US power. FBI\nprograms to suppress\ndissident groups (\u2018Who\nthe Fuck Needs COINTELPRO?\u2019), women\u2019s\nrights (\u2018Ladies Night\nin Loserville\u2019, where a\nfemale narrator taunts\nmisogynists with the\nsexually-liberated refrain\n\u201cI fuck to cum / Don\u2019t\nlay your repressed shit on\nme\u201d), and immigration\n(\u2018Fuck the Border\u2019) are\nall on the chopping block.\nThe subjects are still\ntopical: perhaps it is a\nsad commentary that the\nsame radical statements\nmade near two decades\nago are still radical today.\nWhatever the political\nreading, the lyrics are in\nlucid prose, and are worth\na read.\nMusically, the album\nthrashes. Propagandhi is\npossibly the most technical punk band in the\nbusiness, and this album\nfeatures musicianship in\nspades. The grooves on\nthisalbumare,throughand\nthrough, mad; drummer\nJord Samolesky deserves\na special shout-out for his\nvibrant toms work. The\nguitar lines are intricate\nworks of blow-the-roof-of\npunk rock art, glimmering\nfor mere seconds before\ndisintegrating into more\npower-chord thrash.\nTo conclude, Today\u2019s\nEmpires, Tomorrow\u2019s\nAshes is a powerful\nstatement by a passionate\nband about issues that are\nstill very much primary\nin the public conscious-ness, brimming with\nthrash-punk goodness\nreinforcing the album\u2019s\ncore thesis: here today,\ngone tomorrow. Ashes is a\nclassic album that isn\u2019t to\nbe missed.\nMUSIC\nHenry Eshbaugh\nMusic Editor\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with my hands.\u201d // Columbia\nMUSIC\nSimran Kukran\nMusic Writer\nArtist: First Aid Kit.

He is an artist who\nsince the mid-noughties,\nalongside his esteemed\nrecord label Erased Tapes,\nhas brought forth sounds\nseemingly from other\nworlds. All Melody, his\nmost recent album, is a\ncontinuation of his eclectic and nuanced music\nhistory, and stands up as\nan innovative and stylised\nalbum of its own.\nAll Melody starts extremely well. \u2018The Whole\nUniverse Wants To Be\nTouched\u2019, a beautiful first\ntrack, uses a sumptuous\narrangement of choral\nvocals to immediately\nlull the listener into\na calm sway, before\nsmoothly progressing\ninto calm electronic\nchords reminiscent\nof his previous\nalbum, Spaces.\nIt merges sweetly\ninto the more upbeat\nsecond track, \u2018Sunson\u2019\nto create a lovely 15\nminute opening.\nWhat is most\ncompelling\nabout this\nbeginning\nis its satisfaction of one of Frahm\u2019s\nkey talents: his ability to\nblend classical themes\nand arrangements into an\navant-garde expression,\nonly to then lift it seam-lessly into a more acces-sible, galvanised form. He\nmerges the initial vocals\ninto a thematic warp, that\nthen gives way to a rich,\nbouncy, electronic sound.\nAn understated\nambience is then established and perpetuated\nin the follow up track\n\u2018A Place\u2019, before Frahm\nshifts to familiar territory\non \u2018My Friend the Forest\u2019.\nHere, Frahm seems to\nrevisit his work on one\nof his subtler albums,\nScrews, and pours out\na tentative and melodic\nelectronic piano piece.\nAmongst this composition lies the familiar\nclicks and clacks of his\npiano, recorded as such to\npreserve the mechanical\nfeeling of the instrument.\nThe lamenting notes that\ndance out of his fingers\nare heartrending and de-lightful.\nBy the album\u2019s\nmidpoint, Frahm has\nvery much created a\nsense of journey or want\nthereof, a feeling perhaps\nbest termed in his native\ntongue as\nwander\u201cTurning\nthe erratic\nnature of\nexperimental\nambient music\ninto more\nlayered and\nformulaic\ntracks that\nedge towards\nbeautiful\ncrescendos\u201d\nlust. Tracks like \u2018Human\nRange\u2019 and \u2018Forever\nChangeless\u2019 tinkle by and\ndraw the listener deeper\ninto the music, before\nreaching towards a rather\nepic middle portion of the\nmusic. I found myself\nmourning the transition of\ncertain musical sections\ninto others, desperate to\nhold onto a known and\nrewarding sound. But,\ndespite this, the exchange\nof a beautiful moment for\nthe pursuit of a new one\ndrives the piece into a fulfilling complexity. Frahm\nseems to be fully aware of\nthis, building his songs to\na climax before changing\ndirection, offering reflective mid points to the\nlistener and novel musical\npathways for explore.\nDespite this heaped\npraise, the album is not\nperfect. There are times\nwhen tracks feel drawn\nout, and sometimes\nthe ambient sounds\ncreated seem to merely\nact as filler between\ncompositions. The final\ntrack, \u2018Harm Hymn\u2019 is\nperhaps the worst. The\nalbum is screaming for\na more powerful ending,\nanother blissful moment\nor delicate piano tug at\nthe heart, yet instead it\nstalls with a rather boring\ncollection of warps. It\nbegs for a bang or even a\nfade, but instead plateaus.\nTracks like \u2018Fundamental\nValues\u2019 and \u2018Momentum\u2019\nalso seem rather plain\nwhen compared to earlier\nmoments. It is at these\nlatter points when the\nalbum is dullest, melodically at its weakest,\nand most contextually\ndirectionless compared\nto its vivid and exciting\nbeginning.\nAll Melody has a lucid\ntexture and a beautifully\nunique feel. It combines\nmany of the skills\ndemonstrated on previous\nalbums like Spaces or\nScrews to create something genuinely moving,\nproviding a beautiful\nambience in which to soak\nup transcendent vibra-tions. Frahm excels at\nturning the erratic nature\nof experimental ambient\nmusic into more layered\nand formulaic tracks that\nedge towards beautiful\ncrescendos, and offers\nan intersection between\nclassical and modern\napproaches to create\nsomething accessible yet\nartistically challenging.\nAll Melody is a brilliant\nculmination of his excellent repertoire as a\npianist and an electronic\nproducer and provides a\nstimulating, immersive\nlisten. However, it loses\nsome of its grace towards\nthe end, causing holistic\ndamage to an otherwise\nflawless album.\nAll Melody is out today // Erased Tapes\nMUSIC\nJack O\u2019Brien\nMusic Writer\nArtist: Nils Frahm.

The progression of these tracks is fantastically immersive, but\nwhat is most incredible is\nFrahm\u2019s tendency to build\na track up with increasing\nferocity, blessing us with\na few ecstatic moments,\nbefore shifting musical\nfocus in the pursuit of\nnew sonic variation.\nHe creates moments of\necstasy and leaves them\nbehind in pursuit of a\nnew sound, mid track.\nThe feeling created is one\nsynonymous with that\nexperienced when\nlistening to\nclassical\n\n"

First and\nforemost, we\u2019ve set up\na dartboard in the office,\nmeaning my day is now\nregularly punctuated by\nthe steady \u2018thwack\u2019 of\ndarts hitting board (or,\nmore likely, the wall).\nIt remains to be seen\nwhether the Felix Office\nbecomes more popular\nthan the Union Bar. If it\ndoes, we'll start charging.\nBut what has been\ntaking up much of our\ntime over the past couple\nof weeks has been our\nanalysis of the endowment\nfund \u2013 the pot of money\nImperial have set aside for\nnon-academic activities,\nwhich they invest in order\nto generate more funding.\nFollowing a series of\nFreedom of Information\nrequests, we were able to\ngather together data on the\nlast few years of the fund\u2019s\ninvestments, and set about\nanalysing it hurriedly.\nWe quickly encountered a problem, however:\nwhile some companies\nwere easily identifiable,\nother investments were\nplaced in obscure funds,\nwhich often had hundreds\nof smaller investments\nwithin other companies.\nWith a bundle of enthusiasm and a misplaced trust\nin the workings of Excel,\nwe duly set to work,\nlooking through thousands of pages of financial\ndocumentation to work\nout exactly where Imperial\u2019s money is going.\nThe results made for\nsurprising reading. While\nImperial makes sure it\nhas no direct investments\nin tobacco, through their\nfunds they have over \u00a33.5\nmillion invested in various\ntobacco companies. Their\nexcuse is twofold \u2013 that\nthey can\u2019t know what is\nin these funds, and that\ntheir make ups change so\nquickly they can\u2019t keep\ntrack. With all due respect\nto the College, these are\npoor excuses. Our team\nmanaged to find out\nexactly what these funds\ncontained, down to the\ndollars and cents, over\nthe space of a couple of\nweeks. We also found that\nsome of these funds have\ncontained tobacco since at\nleast 2011, if not before.\nThe endowment fund is\nan issue that comes up\nagain and again, so there\u2019s\nabsolutely no excuse for\nthe College not knowing\nwhere their money is.\nWhy care about the\nfund? You might not\ngive much thought to the\ninvestments; you might\nbe too busy being buried\nunder coursework. You\nmight even think that investments in the fossil fuel\nindustry is a good thing,\nsince a small amount of\nthe money will be going\ntowards renewable energy\n\u2013 the College certainly\nseems to believe this. I\ndisagree, but no matter.\nThis story is important\nbecause information is\nimportant. Knowledge,\nas we are so often told,\nis power, and so knowing\nwhere the money is going\nis the first step to even\nbeginning to try and\nchange things. And it\u2019s\nyour money as well. You\nare all part of Imperial,\npart of one larger commu-nity, and so decisions that\nthe College are making\nare being made in your\nname. I, personally, like a\nnumber of other students\nI spoke to, do not want\ninvestments to be made in\nthe fossil fuel, tobacco, or\nweapons industry in my\nname. Where these investments are being made,\nthey should at least be\ndone transparently. They\nare not. And this is where\nwe come in. So please,\ngive the story a read, and\nif it upsets you, let College\nknow what you think \u2013 the\nchange starts with us.\nFred Fyles \u2013 Felix Editor\n2\nFelix is recruiting!\nWewantyou\u2013yes,you!We\u2019relookingforwriters,photographers,editors,illustrators,reporters,\ncomputer experts and grammar nerds to join our team.

The spring\nterm had just started, and\non Friday of week one, we\nhopped on an Uber to go\nto the airport as quickly\nas possible. I finished my\nlast lecture of the day at\n6pm, and the flight was to\ndepart at 8.45pm. I had to\nhurry back to my room,\nget my stuff, and leave.\nThis was the beginning of\na weekend in Denmark.\nWe were delighted to find\nout that it was snowing\nthere!\nDay One\nAs we had limited time\nin the city and wanted\nto see as much of it as\nwe could, we decided to\ngo on a walking tour. It\nwas a free walking tour\nin English that departed\nfrom the City Hall and\nlasted about 2.5 hours. It\nwas freezing and snowing\noutside (-2o\nC) but we had\na 30-minute break in a\nwarm caf\u00e9 near Nyhavn,\nthe famous harbour in Copenhagen. We ate quickly\nand then headed out to the\nsnow for more photos.\nThe highlight of the tour\nwas the Little Mermaid,\na small bronze sculpture\ninspired by a fairy-tale by\nH. C. Andersen. We also\npassed Amalienborg, the\nresidence of the Danish\nroyal family, where we\nlearned the reasons the\nDanes are considered the\nhappiest citizens, despite\nnot seeing much sun and\npaying huge taxes. (Hint:\nit\u2019s because they receive\nmany services for free.\nFor example, medical\ntreatment).\nYou can find these\nkind of tours in different\nEuropean cities (we took\none in Krak\u00f3w as well),\nand they are really good\nif you want something\ncheap. Although they are\nnamed \u201cfree\u201d, you are\nexpected to give a tip at\nthe end, based on how\nmuch you liked it. But\nagain, it will cost less than\ngoing on a proper walking/\nsightseeing tour. Another\nadvantage of such tours\nis that the guide wants to\nmake a good impression\nto get more tips, so you\ncan assume that he/she\nwill be friendly, funny,\netc. My advice on tipping\nis to give half the amount\nyou would give on a paid\ntour per person.\nIn the afternoon, we\nvisited the Guinness\nWorld Records Museum,\nan interesting small\nmuseum featuring information about worldwide\nrecords. After that, we\nwalked around the city\ncentre and then returned\nto the hotel, as it was as\ncold as -6o\nC at night, the\nlowest temperature I had\never experienced.\nDay Two\nOn our second and last\nday, we decided to visit\nthe Tower of Christiansborg Palace for the views\nacross Copenhagen. The\nweather was nice: it was\nsunny and everything was\ncovered in snow, and we\ncould enjoy some great\nviews. The entrance to the\ntower was also free.\nOur next stop was\nChristiania, in the area\nof Christianshavn. The\ndistrict has its own interesting story with hippies\nand conflicts between the\nlocals and the government\nthat is worth keeping\nin mind before visiting.\nAfter that, we collected\nour luggage from the hotel\nand headed to the airport.\nThe quickest and cheapest\nway was by train.\nIn general, Copenhagen\nis an expensive city, but\nwith a bit of planning and\na few free attractions in\nmind, you can see a lot for\nless. Of course, there are\nmany more things to do:\nthere are many interesting\nmuseums and palaces to\nexplore, and don\u2019t forget\nthe Tivoli Park, Copenhagen\u2019s most known amusement park. Unfortunately,\neven though our hotel was\nfive minutes away from\nthe park, it was closed for\nwinter.\nMany European countries pride themselves on their (culturally) rich and famous capital cities. After spending a\nweekend in Copenhagen, Elina Michaelidou shares some tips and tricks to make the most of this beautiful city\nin a short time.\n\u201cThe Danes\nare considered\nthe happiest\ncitizens,\ndespite not\nseeing much\nsun and paying\nhuge taxes\u201d\nFun Fact\nThere are more bikes\nin Copenhagen than\npeople! Copenhagen\nis a bike-friendly city\nand renting a bike is the\ncheapest way to move\naround.\nEd: For more travel\nstories and tips, visit\nElina\u2019s blog at \t\t\nempnefsysandtravel.com\n\n"

The album title\nsays enough.\nBeautiful Thugger\nGirls\nYoung Thug\nYoung Thug\u2019s cadence\nhas always been one of his\nmain selling points. On\nBeautiful Thugger Girls,\nhis vocals really shine.\nThe instrumental and\nthat he does so well\n(\u2018Family Don\u2019t Matter\u2019,\n\u2018Tomorrow Til Infinity\u2019,\n\u2018Do U Love Me\u2019, \u2018You\nSaid\u2019, \u2018Oh Yeah\u2019, \u2018Take\nCare\u2019) often builds in a\nway that is sensual and\nexhilarating. Even on the\nmore downbeat and sober\nsounding tracks (\u2018Daddy\u2019s\nBirthday\u2019, \u2018Feel It\u2019, \u2018Me or\nUs\u2019) Young Thug creates a\nsimultaneously accessible\nand intimate atmosphere\nfor the listener where\ntrap can often be neither.\nThis project demonstrated\nexactly why Young Thug\nis a pioneer of the melodic\ntrap sound as he continues\nto push its boundary,\nsomething that an album\nlike HNDRXX will only\ngo so far in attempting.\nPlayboi Carti\nPlayboi Carti\nThis, Playboi Carti\u2019s\ndebut mixtape, exemplifies how simplicity,\nrepetitiveness, and\nambience can make cloud\ntrap immediately hypnotic\nand addictive. Everything\nis minimalistic, including\nCarti\u2019s vocals. He fills\npockets in the spacey\nproduction with adlibs or\na line repeated five or six\ntimes. The stand out tracks\non this project, \u2018Magnolia\u2019\nand \u2018dothatshit!\u2019, both\nperfectly encapsulate the\n\u201cCarti sound\u201d that this\nproject owes its success\nto. Carti\u2019s rhymes float\neffortlessly inside, rather\nthan on top of, fluid beats\nthat were designed to be\nindescribably incomplete\nwithout his presence.\nThis results in a blissful\ndaydream aesthetic,\npainting the backdrop to\nthe ultimate trap utopia\nof sex, money and drugs\nwith no accountability to\nruin it, only charisma and\nentitlement.\nDroptopwop\nGucci Mane\nAs the undisputed\ngodfather of trap, with\nupwards of 70 projects\nsince 2005, one wouldn\u2019t\nblame Gucci Mane if he\nwere all but out of new\nideas. However, as proven\nby Droptopwop, this is\nnot the case. There isn\u2019t\na moment on this project\nwhere Metro Boomin\ndoesn\u2019t lay down a\nflawlessly cold and often\nsinister sounding pro-duction. On each track,\nGucci Mane rises to the\noccasion with his bars,\nsounding confident and\ncalculated. His flow consistently occupies a lot of\nspace, somehow sounding\nslow and kind of graceful\neven when fast paced and\naggressive. When rapping\nabout the gang lifestyle\nhe knows so well, Gucci\nshows us that lyrical\ncontent in trap can be\ninsightful and mature. He\ntakes this a step further on\ntracks such as \u2018Helpless\u2019,\n\u2018Finesse The Plug Interlude\u2019and \u2018Dance With The\nDevil\u2019, sharing the darkest\ncorners of his insecurities\nand perversion, laying\nhimself bare in a way that\nmakes the listener almost\nuncomfortable considering his butch image.\nThis project is the sign\nof a huge second-wind in\nGucci\u2019s career.\nWithout Warning\n21 Savage, Offset,\nMetro Boomin\nWithout Warning is\nprobably, technically\nspeaking, the best trap\nproject of 2017, brilliant\nfor many of the same\nreasons as Droptopwop.\nOne of these reasons\nis Metro Boomin, the\nessential powerhouse\nof almost all top quality\nmodern trap albums. With\nthis project, he comes\nthrough with similarly\nchilling and gruesome\nproduction, making 21\nSavage feel right at home\nas he delivers mercilessly\nmenacing and murderous\nbars. That is not to say that\nthis project is so fierce that\nit is off-putting, indeed the\ncut-throat sound is sufficiently off-set by Offset,\nwho brings a more upbeat\nenergy and flair to the\ntable. Still, there is surprising cohesion between\nall three forces. The\nrigorous craftsmanship in\nthe production is obvious\nall through the project\nbut particularly shines\non the ominous sounding\n\u2018Nightmare\u2019, complete\nwith what sounds like\na xylophone melody\nfrom a child\u2019s haunted\ntoy box. 21 Savage and\nOffset are both similarly\nuncompromising in each\nof their verses, making\nfor a project teeming with\nbangers.\nLuv Is Rage 2\nLil Uzi Vert\nSimply put, this is the\nmost futuristic sounding\ntrap project to have been\nmade in recent years,\npacked full of ideas that\nexemplify the infinite\npotential for trap to bring\na unique sound to the\nhip-hop landscape. On\nLuv Is Rage 2, Lil Uzi\ncreates a universe, of\nwhich he is the super-hero. With unforgivably\ntheatrical production that\nchallenges the listener and\nan inimitable vocal style\nthat rides it in the most\nunconventional and beautifully carefree manner,\nLil Uzi takes us soaring\nabove the homogeneous\ntrap sound played to\ndeath in clubs and on the\nradio. The first high point\nof this album comes in\nthe form of \u2018Feelings\nMutual\u2019; a show stopping\nproduction builds to a\nmagnificent apogee of\norchestral synths, cutting\nand dropping to perfectly\nmatch Lil Uzi\u2019s impassioned cries that mourn the\nunspeakable pain of a lost\nlove. \u2018XO TOUR Llif3\u2019\nis similar but this time\nthe track serves as a more\nunhinged and reckless\nsounding ballad. The\nlyrics are heavy, focusing\non love, life and death,\nimmediately cathartic to\nscream out the way Uzi\ndoes, his vocals bouncing\noff the beat. Simply put,\nthis project is experimen-tal, tragic and triumphant\nbut passionate all over. In\nplaces, sounds and lyrics\nbecome imaginative to the\npoint of obnoxious (\u2018Early\n20 Rager\u2019) but that can be\nforgiven in a heartbeat\nwhen the genius of the\nalbum\u2019s best moments is\nconsidered.\noften country-influenced\ntrap beats are very sweet\nand intoxicating and these\nvocals perfectly complement them. The range\nin pitch and the often\nbeautiful melodies he\nbrings to songs, whether\nin his singing or rapping\nor the thing in between\n(Clockwise from top left) Beautiful Thugger Girls; Playboi Carti; Without Warning;\nLuv Is Rage 2; Droptopwop // Atlantic;\nAWGE; Sony; Atlantic; Atlantic\nfucking list for you. Fucking sue us.\n(Clockwise from top right) Huncho Jack,\nJack Huncho; PrettyGirls Like Trap Music;\nCulture; The Booty Tape; HNDRXX // Capitol;\nUniversal; Quality Control; Asylum; A1\nTen projects from the past year that prove we still\nThat\u2019s right, we\u2019ve got another\nMUSIC\nAsad Raja\nMusic Writer\nT\noday\u2019s release of\nMigos\u2019 Culture\nII marks the start\nof, what will\nhopefully be, another\nyear of refreshing and\ninventive mainstream\ntrap projects. Last year\nwas very content heavy\nfor the genre, yielding\nmore than a few projects\nthat provided optimism in\nthe sound\u2019s longevity and\ncontinued progression.\nHNDRXX\nFuture\nFrom his last few\nprojects since DS2, it\nwas clear that Future\u2019s\nextreme comfort in\nmainstream hip-hop were\nbringing a complacency\nand repetitiveness to\nhis sound. HNDRXX\nhowever, was Future\u2019s\nattempt at changing up\nhis chart-topping formula\nwhilst achieving the same\nresults by focusing more\non singing and melody.\nAnd, for the most part,\nthe project delivered.\nThe production is often\nsweet-sounding or playful\nwith Future slowing\nhis flow appropriately,\ncoming off more introspective and humble (\u2018My\nCollection\u2019, \u2018Coming Out\nStrong\u2019, \u2018Neva Missa\nLost\u2019, \u2018Sorry\u2019) or happy-go-lucky (\u2018Incredible\u2019,\n\u2018Testify\u2019, \u2018Fresh Air\u2019). Of\ncourse, this wouldn\u2019t be\na Future project without\na handful of forgettable\nfiller-tracks and, in places,\nit is very evident that\nthe singing thing isn\u2019t\nexactly his fort\u00e9 (it gets\nparticularly bad on \u2018Use\nMe\u2019). However, at its best,\nHNDRXX raises hopes for\nmelodic trap.\nHuncho Jack, Jack\nHuncho\nTravis Scott and Quavo\nThis collaborative\neffort between trap\u2019s\nheavy weight champ and\nits current poster child\nwas highly anticipated.\nThe project as a whole\nis solid, held back by a\nfew moments where the\npair lack chemistry or an\nidea sounds unfinished.\nHowever, at their best,\nTravis and Quavo each\nride the beat seamlessly\nand complement each\nother nicely with ad-libs\nand vocal layering. The\nstand out feature of this\nproject is its production.\nMike Dean comes through\nwith some of the most\neffective trap beats of the\nyear(\u2018HunchoJack\u2019,\u2018Go\u2019,\n\u2018Saint Laurent Mask\u2019,\n\u2018Moon Rock\u2019, \u2018Where\nU From\u2019). \u2018How U Feel\u2019\nsamples \u2018The World II\u2019\nby Shigeo Sekito, recognisable immediately from\nits use in Mac Demarco\u2019s\n\u2018Chamber of Reflection\u2019.\nThis is a particular standout moment and accurately demonstrates how the\nsound of modern day trap\ncan truly transcend its ste-reotypes. Quavo\u2019s triplet\nflow really shouldn\u2019t work\nover this sample\u2026but it\njust does. It really does.\nThe Booty Tape\nUgly God\nIt would seem that\nmemes and hip hop are\nbecoming increasingly\nsymbiotic. Ugly God\nstands as testament to that.\nThis, his debut project, is\npacked full of hilarious\npunchlines and ridiculous\nmusings. Something\nabout the project makes\neach song sound like\nthe intro track of a debut\nUgly God album that this\nis not. That is not even\nmeant in a bad way, and\nit is clear that Ugly God\nmeant for this, ensuring\nthat the project does not\noverstay its welcome at\na brisk 23 minutes. The\ndream trap production\nand purposefully stupid\nsubject matter make this a\nvery entertaining project,\nperfect for winding down\nto. It has been evident for\na while now that there is\nroom in trap for music\nthat is not at all challenging to listen to, with lyrics\nthat flow past listeners,\nleaving no lasting impres-sion. Take this scenario\nand make the artist self-aware to the point that\nthey feel comfortable\nsharing their weirdest and\nmost immature thoughts\n(without going full Lil\nDicky) whilst making\nbeats similarly loose and\nnonchalant, and you might\njust have something.\nBetter to rap about stupid\nshit than to rap about shit\nstupidly.\nPretty Girls Like Trap\nMusic\n2 Chainz\nIf Views was a trap\nalbum, this would be it.\nPretty Girls Like Trap\nMusic was one of the most\naccessible and coherent\nsounding hip hop albums\nof 2017 and serves as\na testament to what a\nno-brainer the mellow trap\nsound is today. Indeed, it\nfeels as though, despite\nthe production being\ndecidedly trap influenced\non most of these songs, it\nwas very necessary for 2\nChainz to remind us in the\ntitle that this is indeed a\ntrap album. The big-ticket\nfeatures on this thing all\ndeliver very agreeable\nverses or hooks, giving\nthe mainstream hip-hop\nlistener exactly what they\nwould expect and prefer\nfrom each guest \u2013 Quavo,\nTravis and Swae Lee\neach come through with a\ncatchy hook as opposed to\nfire bars; Nicki and Drake\neach confidently deliver a\nrelaxed yet boastful verse;\non \u2018Bailan\u2019, Pharrell\nproduction does many\nfavours for this album,\ncreating a coherent, cool\nmood with switch-ups\nand intricacies that keep\nthe listener on their toes.\nThe album is a perfect\nexample of what a high\nquality pop-trap album\nshould sound like.\nCulture\nMigos\nCulture serves as a masterclass on how to make\ntrap bangers. Song after\nsong on this album, Migos\nuse their triplet flow,\nperfectly timed ad-libs\nand watertight back and\nforth to create memorable\nhooks and catchy verses.\nTheir versatility is also\nproven on this album;\nthe three-headed beast\nthat is Migos can go from\naggressive and bragga-docios (\u2018T-Shirt\u2019, \u2018Bad\nand Boujee\u2019, \u2018Slippery\u2019,\n\u2018Deadz\u2019) to more reflective and subdued when\nthe beat guides them\nthat way (\u2018Big On Big\u2019,\n\u2018Brown Paper Bag\u2019).\nThis album sounds like\na glory lap from Migos,\nand a well-earned one too.\nSince they achieved major\ncommercial breakthrough\nwith the release of \u2018Bad\ndoes his \u2018Happy\u2019 thing\nas opposed to his left\nfield N.E.R.D. thing. This\nreally pays off for the\nmost part with the album\nstaying consistently lis-tenable, but never boring\n(with the exception of \u2018It\u2019s\nA Vibe\u2019, which sounds\nlike one long hook).

Let\u2019s take a look at\nthe shocks and snubs in\nthe major categories; and\nwhere the Oscar races\nstand ahead of the handing\nout of golden statuettes on\nMarch 4th\n.\nBest Picture Heading\nTo Fox Searchlight\nFox Searchlight is\nhavingayeartoremember,\nwith two of their pictures,\nThe Shape of Water and\nThree Billboards Outside\nEbbing, Missouri going\nhead-to-head for a number\nof the biggest awards, including the most coveted\nprize of all: Best Picture.\nThe Shape of Water has\nlead for nominations at\nmost of the major awards\nceremonies this season,\nand continued this trend\nby raking in a whopping\n13 nods, a total bettered\nonly by All About Eve,\nTitanic and last year\u2019s La\nLa Land in Oscar history.\nIt won the Producers\nGuild of America and\nCritics\u2019 Choice Moive\nAward for Best Picture,\nputting it in good stead\nto go all the way with\nthe Academy. Three\nBillboards will have a say\non that though; having\nwon the notoriously Oscar-predictive Audience\nAward at the Toronto International Film Festival\nand picked up the Golden\nGlobe earlier this month,.\nMartin McDonagh will\nbe pleased with his film\u2019s\nhaul of seven nomina-tions, if a bit miffed that\nhe was snubbed for Best\nDirector.\nThe rest of the\nnominees were largely as\nexpected, with Call Me\nby Your Name, Lady Bird,\nGet Out, Dunkirk, and\nreviews of the year only to\nbe ignored by all the major\nguilds. Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s romantic period\npiece is peaking at just the\nright time for voters, and\nFocus\u2019 release strategy\nmuch be commended.\nMudbound, The Big Sick,\nThe Florida Project,\nWonder Woman, and I,\nTonya were all locked out.\nActing Awards: A\nForegone Conclusion\nThe Screen Actors\nGuild Awards are the\nstrongest predictors for\nAcademy success, and\nwith those being handed\nout a couple of days before\nthe Oscar nominations are\nannounced, we are robbed\nof a little excitement as\nwe already know who will\nwin.\nBest Actor nominees\n- Daniel Day-Lewis\n(Phantom Thread),\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet (Call\nMe by Your Name), Daniel\nKaluuya (Get Out) and\nGary Oldman (Darkest\nHour) - were already\nlocks, with Oldman the\nheavy favourite to win for\nhis portrayal of the early\npart of Winston Churchill\u2019s premiership. The fifth\nslot was between Golden\nGlobe winner James\nFranco (The Disaster\nArtist) and screen legends\nTom Hanks (The Post)\nand Denzel Washington\n(Roman J. Israel, Esq.).\nFranco was the front\nrunner for that last slot\nbut sexual misconduct\nallegations appear to have\nderailed his campaign,\nwith Washington stepping\nin as the Academy\u2019s\nsnubbing of former\ndarling Hanks continues.\nFrances McDormand\n(Three Billboards Outside\nEbbing, Missouri) is a sure\nthing to pick up her second\nBest Actress win, while\nSaoirse Ronan (Lady\nBird), Margot Robbie (I,\nTonya) and Sally Hawkins\n(The Shape of Water) were\nalways guarantees for ac-knowledgement. Annette\nBening (Film Stars Don\u2019t\nDie in Liverpool) was\nonce again given the cold\nshoulder to allow the\nAcademy to give Meryl\nStreep (The Post) her\ncustomary nomination.\nInitialSupportingActor\nfavourite Willem Dafoe\n(The Florida Project) was\nexpectedly nominated,\nwhile new front runner\nSam Rockwell (Three\nBillboards Outside\nEbbing, Missouri), who\nis sweeping all the awards\ngoing, was nominated\nalongside cast-mate\nWoody Harrelson, the\nfirst dual nominees in this\ncategory since Harvey\nKeitel and Ben Kingsley\nfor Bugsy in 1991. At the\nage of 88, Christopher\nPlummer (All the Money\nin the World) became the\noldest ever actor nominated for an Academy\nAward, a remarkable job\nconsidering he stepped in\nto reshoot the disgraced\nKevin Spacey\u2019s scenes in\nthe just over a week, with\na day\u2019s notice. Rounding\nout the Supporting Actor\nnominees were Richard\nJenkins (The Shape of\nWater), ending Armie\nHammer and Michael\nStuhlbarg\u2019s hopes of\nscoring for Call Me by\nFilm Editor Ashley Luckyram reacts to landmark nominations for first-timers Greta Gerwig and Jordan Peel, as\nPhantom Thread and Paul Thomas Anderson ghost into the reckoning.\nLoveless, Phantom Thread, and The Shape of Water could all be taking home awards come March // Altitude; Universal; Fox Searchlight\nYour Name.\nTV stalwarts Allison\nJanney (I, Tonya) and\nLaurie Metcalfe (Lady\nBird) will do battle for\nthe Supporting Actress\naward, with Janney widely\nanticipated to come out\nvictorious. Mary J. Blige\n(Mudbound) and Octavia\nSpencer (The Shape of\nWater) had been fairly\ngood shouts for nods and\nduly delivered. While\nHong Chau (Downsizing),\nHolly Hunter (The Big\nSick) and Kristin Scott\nThomas (Darkest Hour)\nhad hoped to be in with a\nchance, Lesley Manville\n(Phantom Thread) has\ncome storming through\nlate on for an icy and\npowerful turn that goes\ntoe-to-toe with the great\nDaniel Day-Lewis, so\nmuch so that she may\neven be a surprise winner.\nBest Director Proves\nSurprisingly Unpredictable\nWell, well, well.\nHeading into Tuesday,\nwe knew who three\nof the Best Director\nnominees would be:\nGuillermo Del Toro (The\nShape of Water), Martin\nMcDonagh (Three Billboards Outside Ebbing,\nMissouri) and Christopher\nNolan (Dunkirk). Turns\nout we didn\u2019t know shit.\nGolden Globe winner Del\nToro and fellow Directors\nGuild ofAmerica nominee\nNolan booked their seats\nat the Dolby Theatre with\nlittle fuss. After the clam-ouring of numerous men\nand women in the film\nindustry and the general\npublic, riding the wave\nof momentum provided\nby the #MeToo and\nTime\u2019s Up movements,\nGreta Gerwig (Lady Bird)\nfollowed up her National\nBoard of Review win\nand Directors Guild nod\nto become only the fifth\nfemale nominee for Best\nDirector in history, and\nfirst in almost a decade.\nSimilarly, Jordan Peele\n(Get Out), another first\ntime director, became\nonly the fifth black\ndirector in history to\nearn an Academy Award\nnomination. Regardless\nof whether you think\nGerwig or Peele deserved\ntheir spots ahead of\nBAFTA nominees Denis\nVilleneuve (Blade\nRunner 2049) and Luca\nGuadagnino (Call Me by\nYour Name) or Golden\nGlobe nominees Steven\nSpielberg (The Post)\nor Ridley Scott (All the\nMoney in the World),\nthey did earn the highly\npredictive Directors Guild\nnominations; so their nods\nweren\u2019t entirely unex-pected, especially given\nthe pressure to reward\nmore female and ethnic\nminority filmmakers, and\nthe growing diversity in\nthe Academy voting pool.\nSo then the five Directors\nthat they would plum for\nAnderson, a man who\nis to many of them their\ngeneration\u2019s Kubrick.\nOriginal Screenplay\nFar More Competitive\nThan Adapted\nOscar stalwart James\nIvory\u2019s script for Call\nMe by Your Name will\nwin come March \u2013 there\nisn\u2019t any competition. In\nthe end solid efforts from\nMudbound, The Disaster\nArtist, Molly\u2019s Game and\nLogan made up the rest\nof the nominees, but it\nalmost feels as though one\ncould have desperately\nscribbled down the ingredients from the back of\na bottle of Heinz tomato\nketchup on a napkin five\nminutes before the nominations went out and still\nbeen in with a chance of\nan Adapted Screenplay\nnod. In stark contrast\nthe Original Screenplay\ncategory is hotly contest-ed. Greta Gerwig (Lady\nBird), Jordan Peele (Get\nOut), Martin McDonagh\n(Three Billboards Outside\nEbbing, Missouri) and\nGuillermo del Toro &\nVanessaTaylor(TheShape\nof Water) collected their\nprojected nominations,\nwhile Emily V. Gordon\n& Kumail Nanjiani\u2019s\nThe Big Sick managed\nto gazump Paul Thomas\nAnderson\u2019s National\nBoard of Review-winning\nPhantom Thread, even\namidst the latter\u2019s startling\nsuccess. Other hopefuls\nfrom The Post, Dunkirk\nand I, Tonya were rightly\nleft out, though would\nsurely have been amongst\nthe nominees were they\ncompeting in the adapted\ncategory.\nBest Foreign Language Film Wide\nOpen\nThis is always a tough\ncategory to predict. The\nAcademy has a very\nbizarre and convoluted\nway of voting, involving\nbands of films that are\nthen drawn into a shortlist\npartly by popular vote and\npartly by the decree of\nan executive committee,\nfrom which five nominees\nare then chosen (see\nwhat I mean when I said\n\u2018convoluted\u2019). Loveless,\nA Fantastic Woman and\nPalme d\u2019Or winner The\nSquare all picked up their\nexpected and deserved\nForeign Language Film\nnominations. Golden\nglobe winner In the Fade\nand Angelina Jolie\u2019s First\nThey Killed My Father\nwere both shut out. One\nwould have expected\nsuperb Israeli entry\nFoxtrot to jump in. Yet\ninstead, the also well-re-ceived On Body and Soul,\nand the little-seen The\nInsult made the cut. It\u2019s a\nfive-horse race from here\non out.\nAuteur-Driven Blockbusters Dominant\nTechnical Categories\nBig budget fayre often\nsees its best chances of\nOscar success in the technical categories, where\nthey can be rewarding for\ntheir astonishing visual\neffects and sound mixing.\nThis year saw a number of\ndirectors, many of whom\nhave proven themselves\non the indie circuit, take\ntheir meticulous visions\nto the tentpoles. Denis\nVilleneuve (Blade Runner\n2049), Rian Johnson (Star\nWars Episode VIII: The\nLast Jedi), Edgar Wright\n(Baby Driver) and Matt\nReeves (War for the\nPlanet of the Apes) will\nbe pleased to see their\nfilms pick up five, four,\nthree, and one nomination\nrespectively. Another\nbig budget scorer in the\ntechnical categories was\nChristopher Nolan\u2019s\nDunkirk, also breaking\ninto the higher end of the\nawards with Best Picture\nand Best Director nomi-nations.\nThe Best Cinematography nominations matched\nup to the American\nSociety of Cinematographers nominations,\nmeaning Rachel Morrison\n(Mudbound) at long last\nbecame the first woman to\nbe acknowledged in that\ncategory. That was part of\nwider success for Netflix,\nwith the streaming\nnetwork finally cracking\nthe Academy on its way\nto four nominations (the\nAcademy in general has\nbeen more accepting in\nrecent years, and superhero flick Logan also got\na major category nomination for Adapted Screenplay, only the second of its\nkind after Heath Ledger\u2019s\nSupporting Actor win\nfor The Dark Knight 9\nyears ago). Unfortunately\nfor Morrison, she will\nhave to wait for a win,\nas it is surely now Roger\nDeakins\u2019 time. Forget the\nlikes of DiCaprio, Pacino,\nScorsese, and Bridges\nhaving well overdue wins;\nthis is Deakins\u2019 14 nomi-nation, and his stunning\nwork on Blade Runner\n2049 is heavily favoured\nto see him break his duck.\nAfter landmark work\nin his past collaborations\nwith Paul Thomas,\nAnderson in There Will\nBe Blood, The Master\nand Inherent Vice, Jonny\nGreenwood (Phantom\nThread) finally earns a\nlong outstanding nomination for Original Score.\nThe Radiohead guitarist\nis up against veterans\nHans Zimmer (Dunkirk),\nJohn Williams (Star Wars\nEpisode VIII: The Last\nJedi) and Cater Burwell,\nwhile Alexandre Desplat\n(The Shape of Water) is\nthe narrow favourite.\n\u201cThe Shape\nof Water has\ncome into\nthe race\nstrong, with\na record 13\nnominations\u201d\nThe Post all there. Focus\nFeatures will almost have\nas big a grin on their faces\nas Fox Searchlight, with\nDarkest Hour building on\nstrong BAFTArepresentation to score well here,\nas well as a pleasantly\nsurprisingly nomination\nfor the much-deserving\nPhantom Thread, which\nreceived some of the best\n\u201cGreta\nGerwig\u2019s\nnomination\nreflects the\ncurrent climate\nof Hollywood\u201d\nGuild nominees, Del Toro,\nNolan, Gerwig, Peele and\nMcDonagh, were the\nfive Oscar nominees, and\neveryone lived happily\never after. BUT WAIT!\nSurefire choice Martin\nMcDonagh was left out.\nNot for another guild\nnominee, not for another\nBAFTA nominee, and\nnot for another Golden\nGlobe nominee. No, in\nhis stead is Paul Thomas\nAnderson for Phantom\nThread, a completely out-of-left-field but justified\ndecision. The last couple\nof years have shown a\nshift in previous voting\ntrends, with old steadfast\npredictors being thrown\nout the window by the\nyounger and more diverse\nAcademy voting pool.\nWhile they have been\nattributed for earning\nGerwig and Peele selection amongst the elite, no\none seemed to anticipate\nLady Bird has garnered five nominations // A24\n\n"

Who among\nus has not balked at the\nhappiness and success\nof someone we consider\nto be objectively odious,\nabsolutely awful? In the\nlate Peter Shaffer\u2019s classic\n1979 play, the virtuoso\ncomposer Mozart\u2019s very\nname \u2013 \u2018Amadeus\u2019,\n\u201cbeloved by God\u201d \u2013 is\nan affront to the Viennese\ncourt composer Antonio\nSalieri. Whilst Salieri\nis assiduously virtuous,\nhaving bargained with\nGod to be so in exchange\nfor musical fame, Mozart\nis his opposite: selfish,\ninfantile, and rude. Yet it\nis Mozart who is able to\ncompose with seemingly\ndivine inspiration, setting\ndown fully formed masterpieces on paper with\neffortless ease even as\nhe cheats and curses and\nmakes a general nuisance\nof himself. In contrast,\nSalieri\u2019s compositions,\nthough celebrated at\nCourt, are pedestrian. He,\nby his own admission is\ncursed only to be \u201ca pair\nof ears\u201d \u2013 alone able to\nrecognise true greatness\nin Mozart but never able\nmatch it. This he considers\na personal betrayal by the\nDivine Creator, and thus\npits himself against his\nGod, vowing to silence\nMozart as vengeance.\nThe play begins as,\ncrippled with guilt in\nhis dying hours, Salieri\nconjuresuptheaudienceas\nthe \u201cghosts of the future\u201d,\nand confesses his sins,\ndemanding absolution for\nhis plots against Mozart.\nThe years roll back as\nLucian Msamati\u2019s Salieri\nrises slowly from his\nwheelchair and guides us\nthrough the backstabbing\npolitics of 18th\ncentury\nVienna. Msamati gives an\narresting performance \u2013 at\ntimes he addresses the\naudience directly, elsewhere offering commentary of his inner thoughts\nas his castmates stand in\ntableau around him or the\norchestra, replete with 20\nmembers of the Southbank\nSinfonia, strike up. He is\na commanding presence\non stage, his voice thundering in rebuke to God,\nable to make the audience\nhang on the edge of their\nseats with a sharp remark.\nHis Salieri cuts a tragic\nfigure, a dignified man\nbrought low \u2013 though not\nin material success \u2013 by\ncaustic jealousy. Adam\nGillen\u2019s Mozart offers\na stark counterpoint:\ncrass and insufferable,\nin the first act the young\nWolfgang is irritatingly\npuerile, and Salieri\u2019s simmering resentment seems\nentirely logical. Yet as the\nplay progresses, Gillen is\nable to suffuse his char-acterisation with pathos;\nhis Mozart matures and is\ntempered by the misfortunes that come his way.\nIt is not always a nuanced\nperformance \u2013 far from\nit \u2013 but is an ultimately\naffectionate portrayal of\na not altogether likeable\ncharacter.\nAdelle Leonce, as\nMozart\u2019s wife, Constanze\nWeber, is at once defiant\nand vulnerable, whilst\nMatthew Spencer brings\nplenty of comic relief\nto his role as Joseph II,\nthe Hapsburg Emperor.\nAlexandra Mathie, Hugh\nSachs, and Christopher\nGodwin all give fantastic\nperformances as two\nimperious barons of the\nCourt, and the Director of\nthe Opera respectively.\nIn a production that\nhardly ever puts a foot\nwrong, one of the undeniable stars is Matthew\nLonghurst\u2019s direction.\nShaffer\u2019s script demands\na theatrical spectacle,\nand Longhurst delivers.\nRemarkably, Longhurst\nopts to make the orchestra\nan integral part of the\non-stage performance; it\nis a bold choice but one\nthat feels necessary. After\nall, this is a play to which\nmusic is inextricably\nlinked. The violinists,\nflautists and bassoonists\nof the Sinfonia, together\nwith six singers, are not\nresigned to the orchestra\npit, but move around\nthe stage, reacting to the\nactors around them. When\nSalieri describes his\nchildhood deal with God,\nthe orchestra raise their\nhands in silent prayer,\nbut they are not simply\na reflection of Salieri\u2019s\nthoughts \u2013 when he asks\nthem to play an excerpt\nfrom his sub-par opera\nThe Stolen Bucket the\norchestra decline, to great\ncomedic effect.\nThe inclusion of the orchestra in this startlingly\ninventive manner, paired\nwith the brilliant lighting,\ndesigned by Jon Clark,\ncreates a sumptuously\ncinematic experience. In\none tremendous scene\ntowards the end of the first\nact we watch as Salieri,\nupon opening a folio of\nMozart\u2019s finest composi-tions, is overcome. Slight\nmodulations of lighting\npitch us from reality to the\ndepths of Salieri\u2019s tortured\nmind. At first there is a\nslow, urgent thrum of the\nbassoons and trumpet, and\nthe vestiges of the composer\u2019s comfortable front\nroom are dragged off into\nthe wings, Salieri is alone\non an empty stage with\nnothing but the music, as\nthe assembled orchestra,\nstanding on a an elevated\nstage, play Mass in C\nMinor. Then slowly the\nclarinet and violins join\nin on the higher notes, and\nas the majesty of music\ndawns on Salieri, an\nimagined Mozart joins the\norchestra to conduct them\nin a frenzy of movement,\nand Fleur de Bray\u2019s\ncrystal clear soprano rises\nabove the instruments in a\nhaunting Kyrie. Little by\nlittle, the stage on which\nthe music is being played\nadvances towards Salieri,\nand great beams of light,\ngrowing ever brighter,\nshine out towards the\naudience, casting the\norchestra in silhouette.\nEventually, with a great\ncrash of percussion,\nSalieri, in both awe and\ndespair, sinks to his knees.\nWe in the audience cannot\nhelp but be moved.\nThis revival is nothing\nshort of an epic undertak-ing. It may be the story\nof the self-proclaimed\npatron saint of mediocrity\nbut Shaffer\u2019s brilliance\nis plain to see. Shaffer is\nconsidered one of the best\nBritish playwrights of the\n20th\ncentury. There is no\nstronger evidence for this\nthan Amadeus.\nLucian Msamati gives a powerful performance in a fantastic revival of Peter Shaffer\u2019s classic play about envy.\nSalieri was not a big fan of Wolfgang // Marc Brenner\nARTS\nIndira Mallik\nArts Editor\nWhere? National Theatre\nWhen? Until 24th\nApril\nHow Much? From \u00a315\nAMADEUS\nRita, Sue and Bob Too \u2013 an exploration of power, class,\nand women\u2019s voices\nAndrea Dunbar\u2019s masterpiece has come to the Royal Court at the right time. Despite being written in the 1980s, it\nhas a worrying number of echoes in the #MeToo era.\nI\nt was the play that\nnearly didn\u2019t happen.\nAfter the Royal\nCourt\u2019s founder\nMax Stafford-Clark\nwas accused of sexual\nmisconduct, a decision\nwas made to cancel the\nupcoming production of\nAndrea Dunbar\u2019s 1982\nplay Rita, Sue and Bob\nToo, which centres around\nthe relationship between\na married man and two\n15-year olds in Bradford.\nThe theatre said that putting on the play would be\n\u201chighly conflictual\u201d given\nthe current climate, which\nis revealing the grubby\nundercarriage lurking\nbeneath the shiny facade\nof the arts industry. After\nintense pressure, however,\nthey reversed the decision.\nIt was the right move.\nDunbar was a singular\nvoice in the world of\nBritish theatre before her\nuntimely death at 29, and\nRita, Sue and Bob Too\nreminds us of this \u2013 the\nactors all seem to relish\nher verbatim-esque\ndialogue, which manages\nto be humorous and\nheart-breaking in equal\n\u201cThe actors\nall seem to\nrelish Dunbar\u2019s\ndialogue,\nhumorous and\nheart-breaking\nin equal parts\u201d\ncaught up in the plot \u2013\nthey perfectly embody\nthe cruelty that such an\nage group can engender,\nas well as the gaping insecurities that are the root\ncause. Dobson\u2019s Sue possesses a disarming sense\nof confidence, but has to\nface an abusive father at\nhome, while Atwal\u2019s Rita\nis the more conflicted of\nthe two regarding their\nsituation. Atwal manages\nto brilliantly convey the\nyearning for belonging\nso common at that age \u2013\nsending out vague smoke\nsignals of her underlying\nemotions as a means of\ntesting the water, lest she\nfind herself exposed.\nBetween them there\u2019s\nBob, played by James\nAtherton: a young man\ntrapped within a marriage\nhe dislikes, he knows how\nmuch (or little) attention\nhe needs to pay to Rita and\nSue to get them involved.\nWithin the cramped car in\nwhich his character has\nsex with Sue and Rita,\nAtherton is able to bring a\nsense of physical comedy\nto the role, providing the\naudience with plenty of\nconflicting emotions as\nwe begin to sympathise\nwith him.\nBefore the house lights\nwent down, the woman\nbehind me mentioned the\nfilm version of Rita, Sue\nand Bob Too. Directed\nby Alan Clarke in 1987,\nthe film was described\nby my neighbour as \u201ca\nbit of a light romp\u201d.\nThe version we watch is\nanything but. Director\nKate Wasserberg is well\naware of the conflicts\nand tension at the heart\nof Dunbar\u2019s text. This\nbecomes most apparent\nnear the beginning of the\nplay: as Bob takes Rita\nand Sue back home, he\nbegins to ask increasingly\ninappropriate questions,\nbefore eventually having\nsex with each of them in\nturn. Atherton, Dobson,\nand Atwal all make use of\nthe four small chairs that\nserve as the set, contorting\nthemselves against each\nother as Bob\u2019s buttocks\njerk up and down. It\u2019s a\nfunny scene, in the way\nwe instinctively laugh at\nwibbling bottoms. But\nthen the house light slowly\ncome up, and the scene\ndrags on for an uncomfortably long length of\ntime. Go on, Wasserberg\nseems to be saying, look,\nand laugh if you can.\nWhat seems shocking\nand daring about\nDunbar\u2019s play is not so\nmuch the sexual aspect\n\u2013 indeed, it was based\npartly off her own expe-riences, and the current\nwave of accusations of\nmisconduct show us that\nmen taking advantage of\nwomen in lesser positions\nof power has never gone\naway \u2013 but rather the way\nshe centres the working\nclass voice, specifically\nthose of women. Besides\nSue and Rita we\u2019ve got\nBob\u2019s long-suffering\nwife Michelle (Samantha\nRobinson), and Sue\u2019s\nmother (Sally Bankes),\nas well as Rita\u2019s single\nmother \u2013 mentioned but\nnever glimpsed. Through\nthis cast of characters,\nDunbar is able to portray\nthe chilling nature of a\nlife of gradually receding\nopportunities: for Rita\nand Sue, the most important thing is to not get\npregnant. As Sue\u2019s mother\nhauntingly \u201cI was 23\nyears old when I had my\nfirst. I felt trapped. When\nyou\u2019ve had a baby it\u2019s not\na thing you can put to one\nside and say \u2018I\u2019m going\nto the pub tonight\u2019.

    "content": "COMMENT\nFRIDAY, 26TH\nJANUARY, 2018 FELIX\n10\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe endowment fund: to divest or not to\ndivest\nAs Imperial publishes the results of its endowment fund, Shaul Rosten argues that Divest has\na long way to go and needs a new way to do it.\nCOMMENT\nShaul Rosten\nComment Writer\nD\nivest Imperial\nis a movement\nurging the\nUniversity to\ndivest its endowment\ninvestments in fossil\nfuel-related companies,\nan approach similar to\nthat taken by many large\npension funds in recent\nyears. This week the Felix\nteam has procured data\nfrom Imperial, giving a\nrough breakdown of the\ninvestment areas of the\nendowment funds, which\ntotalled over \u00a3266m in\n2017.\nAlthough direct\nfossil fuel investments\ncomprised only 1.7%\nof the total portfolio,\nsupporters of the Divest\nImperial movement\nwill be disheartened\nby the fact that this\nfigure remains almost\nsteady from 2016, being\nreduced by a mere\n\u00a3400,593; this feels\nmore like a tailwind of\nsome poor investments,\nrather than an active\ndivestment strategy. In\naddition, the University\nonly explicitly stated\ntheir direct holdings in\nvarious sectors, with\nover 50% of the fund\nincluded in various\ninvestment portfolios.\nUpon closer examination\nof the precise contents\nof the various funds by\nthe Felix team, it was\ndetermined that, through\nthese investment funds,\nan equivalent of \u00a33.5m\nwas invested in tobacco\ncompanies, and an additional \u00a32.8m in fossil\nfuel companies, on top\nof the direct fossil fuel\nholdings the University\nexplicitly stated.\nTheir reasonable\ndemands for transparency aside, however,\nthe Divest Imperial\nmovement seems, to my\nmind, a slightly flawed\napproach to ensuring that\nthe University upholds\nits moral standards in a\nworld of serious climate\nconcerns. For the first\npart, is divestment of\nfossil fuel holdings \u2013\nwhich, at \u00a38.8m (includ-ing oilfield services), are\nhardly noteworthy from\nthe corporation\u2019s point\nof view \u2013 actually going\nto have the slightest\nhas at its disposal. As a\nshareholder (dependent\non the class of shares\nit owns), Imperial has a\nseat at the table, and this\nhas been increasingly\nused by investment\nvehicles to demand\ngreater Environmental,\nSocial and Governance\n(ESG) awareness and\nperformance from their\nportfolio companies.\nImperial could leverage\nthis exposure to the\nindustry, and partner\nwith similar minded\nshareholders, to demand\nfrom its portfolio companies greater R&D\ninto renewables, and\na weaning off of environmentally damaging\nfossil fuel projects. This\nwould actually engage\nthe companies that are\ndoing the damage, and\nproactively champion\nthe causes of conservation and environmental\nprotection, rather than\nsimply walking out of\nthe room whilst they do\nit.\nThis jumps straight\nonto the second issue\nthat Divest Imperial have\nnot addressed: that some\nof the major fossil fuel\ncorporations are some\nof the biggest investors\ninto renewable technologies in the world, and\nthe capital Imperial have\nplaced into them allows\nthe University to put\ntheir money where their\nmouth is, betting on\ncompanies such as Royal\nDutch Shell, who have\nplans to increase their\nannual renewables R&D\nspending to $1Bn+,\nand who have made\nbold pledges to tackle\nglobal carbon pollution.\nWhilst the data provided\nby Imperial in no way\nmakes it clear that this is\ntheir approach to fossil\nfuel investment, Divest\nImperial must consider\nthese possibilities before\ndemanding a blanket\ndivestment, which may\nachieve little toward\nin the pockets of those\nto whom climate issues\nare not a great concern.\nOverall, I think that\nDivest Imperial make\nan important point: that,\nas a public body that\nshould be an example\nto wider society, it is\nimportant that Imperial\n\u2013 and other Universities\nwith large investment\ntrusts \u2013 embrace an\nattitude of ownership\nand transparency, setting\nout clearly and regularly their investment\nphilosophies, holdings,\nand impacts. However,\nthe simple cry for di-vestment is perhaps not\nthe most constructive\nway forward. Divest\nImperial, although\nsound in principle, must\nconsider the nuances of\nthe argument, to forge\na constructive plan to\nenable Imperial to use\nits financial position to\nbest tackle global chal-lenges, in a maximally\neffective way.\nImperial\u2019s wet dream // Flickr\n\u201cReasonable\ndemands for\ntransparency\naside,\ndivestment\nseems to\nbe a flawed\napproach\u201d\ntheir overall moral aims.\nThere is a third and\nfinal point also yet to\nbe considered by Divest\nImperial. Yes, the fossil\nfuel industry is a generally damaging one for\nthe environment, but,\nas pointed out above,\nImperial\u2019s divestment\nfrom that industry will\nnot deter them from\ncontinuing their nefarious practices. However,\nwhat it might do is\nhamper the returns of\nthe Imperial portfolio,\nas academic studies\nhave previously posited.\nIf Imperial holds these\ninvestments, however,\nand sees the financial\nbenefit of doing so, it\ncan use this capital to\ninvest in the various\ncutting edge renewable\ntechnologies that flow\nfreely from the academic\nwork it undertakes. That\nway, at least some of the\nprofits from fossil fuels\nwill be being put to good\nuse, instead of ending up\nimpact? There are plenty\nof wealthy climate\nchange sceptics, and\nsceptical organisations,\nwho would happily\npurchase these shares\nand buoy the industry,\nwith or without Imperial\u2019s help. That is not to\nsay that because some\npeople are willing to do\nbad things, so should\nwe; rather, I would hope\nthat instead it makes\nthe Divest Imperial\nmovement think more\ncarefully about the most\neffective way of deploying the capital Imperial\n\n"

Yes. Grumpy\nBastard\u2019s reaction to the whole thing.\nCOMMENT\nGrumpy Bastard\nComment Writer\nI\nwatched the fourth\nseries of Black Mirror\nvery recently. For our\nAmerican and mentally impaired readers,\nnote the use of the word\nseries and not season,\nas I am referring to a\ntelevision programme and\nnot a time of year, or an\nattempt to make food taste\nedible. Americanisms are\na very frustrating part of\nlife, but with government\nshutdowns galore there is\nan ever increasing chance\nof a civil war, so hopefully we can take back the\ncolonies and kick some\nsense into them.\nI did not enjoy the latest\nseries of Black Mirror.\nI had high hopes for this\nviewing experience as\nthe previous episodes\nwere very strong and also\ninvolved some prophetic\nelements. For those of\nyou unaware please see\nDavid Cameron fucks a\npig and angry gummy\nbear is a little less controversial than Trump.\nHaving watched it, and\nread the mediocre reviews\nin this excuse of a paper\nI decided to do my own.\nIn the comment section.\nBecause fuck you.\nThe first episode was\nevery neckbeard\u2019s wet\ndream, trapping those that\nbully you in the outside\nworld into some kind of\nhellish nightmare and\ntormenting them in per-petuity. The main reason\nI hated this episode was\nthat it ended in a morally\nsatisfying way, when\nin reality, that creepy\nengineer bloke would be\ncommitting every sex\nrelated crime that he could\nthink of. By setting the\nwhole thing as a \u201ctasteful\u201d\nuniverse, the writers\ndeftly avoided the ethical\nissues surrounding nudity\nin VR and the terrifying\nposition of possessing 3D\nnudes of someone from a\nDNA swab.\na device that allows an\ninsurance saleswoman to\nview people\u2019s memories\nto settle claims. That and\na murderous psycopath\nthat decides that killing\neveryone is the best way\nto minimise the disruption\nto her life as a successful\narchitect. Quite frankly\nI see no problem with\nmurdering people that\nwork in insurance as it\u2019s\nalmost a mercy killing,\nbut in the end, the killer is\nfound out by an inconveniently placed hamster. The\nproblem is that hamsters\nhave terrible eyesight\nand are mostly driven\nby a need to shag and/or\nmurder any sexual competition before dying of a\nheart attack due to over-excitement or a surfeit of\nSouth Americans.\nThe fourth episode was\nHang the DJ. Like the first\nepisode, it was based in a\nweird virtual reality run\nfrom your phone to try and\nfind the perfect mate. The\nthing was that they were\nin the same bar to start\nwith. I pity anyone using\nthis program in Metric.\nThe fifth episode was\ncalled Metalhead, for\nsome reason. I\u2019m fairly\ncertain that the dog robots\nwere based off the Boston\nDynamics creation that\nlooks similar, but is\nmostly abused by humans\nas opposed to hunting\nthem down and shanking\nthem. I feel that the\nconcept of dangerous AI\nhas been hugely overex-plored in many different\ngenres. Black Mirror\nwould probably be doing\nitself a favour if it looked\nreal life semi-autonomous\nweapons in the face and\nshat itself. I also failed\nto understand why it was\nshot in black and white.\nMany critics called this\n\u201cbold,\u201d but I\u2019m afraid that\ncolour TV was invented\nfor a reason: because it\u2019s\nbetter.\nThe sixth episode is the\nworst of the batch. Black\nMuseum is a pathetic\nattempt to canonise the\nwhole of Black Mirror\nand place it all within one\nuniverse. I don\u2019t think\nI\u2019m alone when I say this\nis a terrible idea. Black\nMirror all taking place in\nthe same universe only\nserves to place limits on\nwhat it can explore next.\nThere are some truly\ngroundbreaking technologies that will change the\nway society works, and\nif this programme does\nnot do them justice then\nanother media form will\nhave to. It\u2019ll probably be\na book, which means no\none\u2019ll ever read about it\nand we\u2019ll stumble blindly\ninto a dark future dominated by Jeff Bezos, Mark\nZuckerberg and Elon\nMusk, all fighting to see\nwho can control the most\nsouls to power their life\nsupport machines.\nWarning: Spoilers\nbehind.\nBecause also fuck you.\nWE NEED TO TALK ABOUT...\nWHO IS TO BLAME FOR THE\nLACK OF PEACE BETWEEN\nISRAEL AND PALESTINE?\nOUR NEW DEBATE SHOW WILL BE BROADCAST\nLIVE ON THE FELIX FACEBOOK PAGE\n4PM, 31ST\nJANUARY\n\u201cMurdering\npeople that\nwork in\ninsurance is\nessentially\nmercy killing\u201d\nThe second episode\nwas a little better. The\nconcept of using a far\nfetched technology to be\na far more controlling\nparent was interesting, but\nclearly the writers had\nnever heard of the Turpin\nfamily. Who needs a high\ntech brain implant when\nyou can just chain all your\nkids in a basement. So\nmuch cheaper.\nThe third episode was\nquite frankly ridiculous.\nEssentially it is driven by\nFelix presents\u2026\nThe rise of an unlikely figure in the defence\nof free speech\nAs Jordan Peterson arrives to the UK to promote his new book, Alan Perfect offers his take on\nwhat this pop-star intellectual has to offer.\nCOMMENT\nAlan Perfect\nComment Editor\nT\nhere is absolutely\nno doubt that free\nspeech at universities in the UK\nand the US has hit a low\npoint. There is an obsession with keeping students\nin their safe spaces in\norder to be protected from\nany kind of ideas which\nthey might find offensive.\nThis strategy makes sense.\nIt is, after all, the easy\npath to take. UC Berkeley\ntook the hard path and had\nto spend about 600,000$\non security for an event\nin which conservative\nspeaker Ben Shapiro was\nto speak. A similar free\nspeech problem is found\nhere in the UK, which\nis probably why (now\nex-minister) Jo Johnson\nhad called out universities and threatened them\nwith fines over their so\ncalled \u201cnon-platforming\npolicies\u201d.\nStudents are being protected from ideas that are\nnot their own, and this is\ncreating a culture akin to\nthe protective parent who\ndoesn\u2019t let his children\nplay outside for fear of\ngetting sick. They don\u2019t\ndevelop a response mechanism to deal with outside\nthreats, and this isolation\nhas greatly contributed\nto the rise of Trump and\nBrexit. The left was so\nisolated from the rest of\nthe world that real discussion with the other side\nhappened less, not more.\nAfter years of this kind\nof isolation, any kind of\nconcern about immigration was not discussed,\nbut dismissed as racism;\nthe concerns of white\nworking-class men were\nlargely ignored while their\nincomes stagnated, their\nemployability decreased\nand their life expectancy\ndeclined. It makes perfect\nsense that right-wing populists would fill that gap\nof concern that the left\nwas never ready to even\nbegin to address.\nIn light of this crisis\nof dialogue an unlikely\n\u201chero\u201d of the defence of\nfree speech has arrived:\nUniversity of Toronto\u2019s\nin-house public intellectual Jordan Peterson. A\nclinical psychologist by\ntraining, this professor\ngained notoriety after a\nviral video in which he\nwas seen arguing with\ntrans activists over the\nuse of their pronouns. He\nblatantly opposed laws\nin Canada promoting\ncompulsory use of trans\npronouns and became\npopular after that by\nattending talk shows in\ndefence of free speech.\nWith over 600K followers\non YouTube, where he has\nuploaded a large amount\nof lectures, he has become\nan internet personality.\nIn order to understand\nhis approach to the\ndefence of free speech, I\nrecommend watching his\nrecent heated interview\nwith Channel 4\u2019s Cathy\nNewman, which he did\nin his visit to the UK to\npromote his new book.\nThe key moment came\nwhen asked why his right\nto free speech should\ntrump a trans persons\nright not to be offended.\nHe replied: \u201cIn order to be\nable to think, you have to\nrisk being offensive. Look\nat the conversation we\u2019re\nhaving. You\u2019re willing\nto risk offending me in\nthe pursuit of truth. Why\nshould you be able to\ndo that? It\u2019s making me\npretty uncomfortable.\u201d\nThis response pretty much\nsums up what he thinks\nabout the issue.\nThis follows on,\nhowever, on from his\ncritique on the culture of\nvictimisation that stems\nout from identity politics.\nIt\u2019s interesting how he\ntakes on questions on\nsupposed \u201coppression by\nthe existing social structure of the western patriarchy\u201d. He argues that\ndominance hierarchies are\nnot social constructs, but\nbiological realities that\nevolution hardwired into\nour minds, as lobsters,\nwhich separated our\nevolution trajectory about\n350million years ago, also\nhave these structures.\nWhile his popularity\nrose,alotofhisworkcame\nto light, revealing a much\ndeeper (and potentially\nless controversial) part of\nhis thinking. You discover\ngood practical advice from\na psychologist combined\nwith theoretical, pseu-do-intellectual grandiose\nideas which could potentially pass as philosophy.\nI loved how he explained\nthe origins of the concept\nof sacrifice: you\u2019d think\nprimitive cultures are\ndoing something that\u2019s a\nbit odd by burning their\nfood or their possessions\n(maybe even some\npeople). His insight is the\nidea that these cultures\nwere experiencing a revolutionary realisation: you\ncan forestall gratification\nnow, in the present, and\nget a payoff in the future.\nThe discovery of sacrifice\nwas mankind\u2019s discovery\nof the future.\nHe loves explaining\nreligious concepts using\nJungian archetypes, is\nobsessed with the Soviet\nUnion \u2014you could play\na drinking game with\nthe amount of times he\nmentions Solzhenitsyn\u2019s\nNo, it is not his set of\nideas that\u2019s interesting,\nbut his approach to motivating people to pick\nthemselves up and live\na meaningful life. The\nadvice tends to go along\nthese lines: stop saying\nthings that you know to\nbe untrue, have an aim in\nlife, and organise your life\naround that aim starting\nfrom simple accomplish-ments. Cleaning up your\nroom is the most basic\none (he insists so much on\nthis that it has become a\nmeme) because your room\nis a part of the cosmos you\ncan control even if you\u2019re\na complete mess of a\nhuman being.\nThere is a danger,\nhowever, to all his popularity as a pseudo-intellec-tual YouTube superstar.\nHis hard stance on identity\npolitics and certain ideas\nof the left has gained\nhim some support from\nfactions of the alt-right.\nIt probably makes no\nsense to try to categorize\nhim into some part of\nthe political spectrum. If\nI had, I\u2019d probably call\nhim a classical liberalist.\nBut his notoriety has led\nto red-pillers, 4chan shit-posters and alt-righters to\nbecome a slight part of\nhis following, creating a\nsort of cult-like following\nthat can make the average\nlistener a bit uneasy.\nAnd the temptation to\npander to these groups\nwill always be there,\nconsidering he gets about\n$30,000 a month on\nPatreon donations. Let\u2019s\njust hope he doesn\u2019t fall,\nand keeps focusing on\ngetting people to attempt\nto live meaningful lives in\nthe ocean of chaos that is\nthe world we live in.\n\u201cHis approach\nto motivating\npeople to\nlive full and\nmeaningful\nlives is what\u2019s\ninteresting\u201d\nGulag Archipelago in his\nlectures\u2014 and passionately fights the waves of\nmeaninglessness that arise\nfrom the ashes of this\npostmodern world.\nWhat I find compelling\nabout him, though, is not\nreally his rich underlying\nset of ideas. They are\ninteresting in their own\nway, but have the potential to be fully dismissed\nas pseudo-intellectual\ncharlatanism. I haven\u2019t\ndecided if this is true yet,\nbut the first interview he\nhad with Sam Harris on\nthe Waking Up Podcast\nended up being a two-hour\ndiscussion on the nature\nof truth which, a priori,\nseemed to expose him as\nan intellectual fraud.\nPeterson on his controversial interview in Channel 4// YouTube\n\n"

Starring:\nBarack Obama; John Kerry;\nSamantha Power; Ben\nRhodes. 89 minutes\nTHE FINAL YEAR\nT\nhere are many\nterrible things\nabout Trump\u2019s\nascension to the\npresidency, which \u2013 despite the cries of those\nwho say it was an \u2018inevitable\u2019 side effect of the rise\nin identity politics \u2013 still\ncomes as a shock, a full\nyear on from his inaugura-tion. But one aspect of his\nrise to power which, while\nnowhere near as tragic as\nhis decision to withdraw\nfrom the Paris Agreement\nor his attempts to gut\nhealth insurance cover-age, will go on to have an\nimpact in the future is the\neffect it has on the legacy\nof Barack Obama.\nwarfare and a war on\nwhistleblowers, the arrival\nof Trump \u2013 crashing down\nlike a bequiffed, lumi-nously-orange meteor of\ntrash \u2013 has smoothed out\nthe potential for criticism.\nWe now view Obama\u2019s\npresidency as the halcyon\ndays, when there was a\npresident who was calm,\neloquent, well, and cool.\nAs a result, our view of\nhis two terms as president\ndoes not allow room for\nnuance, a trap into which\nGreg Barker\u2019s documentary The Final Year falls.\nFilmed over the\nlast twelve months of\nObama\u2019s presidency, the\nfilm focuses on a few\nloyal staff members who\nformed the core of his\nforeign policy unit: US\nAmbassador to the UN,Samantha Power; Secretary of State John Kerry;\nWhite House staffer Ben\nRhodes, who advised on\nthe Iran Nuclear Deal;\nand \u2013 for brief periods \u2013\nSusan Rice, the National\nSecurity Advisor. All are\nunited in their wide-eyed\nbelief that the Obama\nDoctrine on foreign policy\nhas, or had, the potential\nto dispel the strong-man\nimage of America on the\nworld stage in favour of\na kinder, gentler form of\npolitics.\nAnd thus we follow the\nteam around the globe:\nKerry attempting to heal\nthe US\u2019s relationship with\nVietnam, drawing to a\nclose a career that has seen\nhim move from war hero\nto anti-war demonstrator\nto political giant; Power\nlistening to Nigerian\nmothers whose daughters\nhave been kidnapped by\nBoko Haram; Rhodes\nreflecting on the momentousness of the Iran Deal.\nWe even have an interview with the president\nhimself, although nothing\ntruly valuable is revealed.\nThis is the main\nissue with the film: any\nproblems that might have\nexisted during Obama\u2019s\npresidency, or any\ninternal tensions between\nmembers of the team are\nmerely hinted at, is never\nrevealed.\nThe last 20 minutes of\nthe film are the most illu-minating, as Trump moves\nfrom joke politician to\nlegitimate candidate to\npresident-elect \u2013 Powers\nwatches the election night\nwith other female UN\nambassadors in one of the\nmost affecting scenes in\nthe film \u2013 but doesn\u2019t tell\nus much more than the\nreaction these seasoned,\nintelligent professionals\nhave to the thought of\nTrump in the White\nHouse: horror at the potential he has to undo their\nwork.\nUltimately, The Final\nYear tells us very little\nabout the Obama pres-idency, or the legacy it\nwill leave. We are given\na surface-level look at\n\u201cThe arrival\nof Trump\n\u2013 crashing\ndown like a\nbequiffed\norange meteor\n\u2013has smoothed\nout potential\nfor criticism of\nObama\u201d\nWhile the Obama years\nwere marked by an increasing reliance on drone\n\u201cWhile we\nhave an\ninterview with\nthe former\nPresident,\nnothing truly\nvaluable is\nrevealed\nthrough it\u201d\nthe lives of his staff, with\nreal exploration eschewed\nin favour of a film that,\nat times, reads like a\n\u2018greatest hits\u2019 montage of\na dying age of normality.\nAll too often, Barker\nsands down the edges of\nwhat could have been a\nfascinating film, veering\ninstead into mere hagiog-raphy.\n\n"

Its results\nhave also been proven to\nreflect racial and gender\nbias.\u201d\nThis is the second year\nin a row that OSU have\nboycotted the NSS over\na continuing row about\nthe TEF. Under original\nplans, NSS scores would\nconstitute one of three\nmetrics used to rate universities as gold, silver,\nor bronze institutions.\nAlthough prime minister\nTheresa May announced\nin October that tuition fees\nwould be frozen for the\nupcoming academic year,\nthere is no indication that\nthis freeze will continue\nafter 2018/19. This would\nallow universities to raise\ntheir tuition fees in line\nwith inflation (or up to\n50% of the inflation rate\nin the case of bronze-rated\nuniversities).\nIn response, the National Union of Students\n(NUS) led a boycott of the\nNSS last year, in which\n25 individual student\nunions participated. ICU\nrejected a motion to join\nthe boycott on the grounds\nthat the motion had been\nsubmitted too late.

Oxford was\nthe second most unequal\nuniversity, while Cambridge was the eighth.\nAlthough both are in the\ntop ten for socioeconomic\ninequality, Oxford and\nCambridge have narrowed\nthe gap in their entrance\nrates.

A number of universities also recruit a third\nfewer students since 2010.\n\u201cIf we want to get to a\npoint where things are far\nmore equitable in terms\nof participation in higher\neducation,\u201d said Fleet,\n\u201cthe way to do it is to\nencourage more people to\napply rather than changing\noffer-making practices.\u201d\nIn response to the data,\na College spokeperson\ntold Felix: \u201cWe firmly\nbelieve that an Imperial\neducation should be open\nto the best and brightest\nstudents, whatever their\nbackground.\u201d\n\u201cWe have a broad portfolio of activities, including working with schools,\ncolleges and community\norganisations to inspire,\nraise aspirations, stimulate\ninterest in STEM subjects\nand support attainment\nfrom primary school\nthrough to A-Levels. We\nalso offer the most generous bursary scheme of its\nkind of any UK university,\nas well as a wide range of\nscholarships. However we\nknow that there is more\nwe can do.\u201d\n\u201cWe are working to\nreview our outreach strategy to understand how we\ncan improve.\u201d\nThe gap in admittance\nrates between socioeconomic groups was\nhighlighted in Union\nCouncil this week, where\na paper for the creation\nof a Working Class and\nSocial Mobility Liberation Officer role was de-feated. The paper, which\nwas proposed by former\nCouncil member Lloyd\nJames and seconded by\na number of Council\nmembers, argued that \u201c\nissues faced by students\nfrom economically disadvantaged backgrounds\nare sufficiently unique to\nmerit dedicated individual\nrepresentation.\u201d\nFintan O\u2019Connor,\nDeputy President\n(Welfare), spoke against\nthe paper. He told Felix:\n\u201cWhile we all share the\nmotivation behind the\npaper, the proposal could\nbe improved to tackle this\nimpression from the opposition was that it would\nbe difficult to combat the\nproblems underprivileged\nstudents face, so we\nshouldn\u2019t bother to try.\nThere was a clear 50/50\nsplit between those who\nvoted for/against the\npaper \u2013 the DPW must\ninvestigate further into\nthe student opinion of this\nrole,\u201d he said.\nJames, who proposed\nthe paper, on the admissions gap data revealed\ntoday: \u201cThese data show\nthat Imperial remains\na bastion of economic\nprivilege. Perhaps it is no\nwonder that Council shot\ndown a motion to create\nan officer responsible for\nrepresentation of working\nclass students. We will\ncontinue to campaign for\ngreater representation for\nthese students.\u201d\nAriana Sadr-Hashemi,\nMental Health Officer,\nhighlighted the need to\n\u201cremain aware of our\nbiases regarding admission\u201d in response to the\nUCAS data. \u201cClearly we\nare not doing enough to\nensure that we attract\nand admit all students,\nrather than just those from\nprivate schools,\u201d she told\nFelix.\nShe said arguments that\nthe role would be \u201cset up\nto fail\u201d and the officer\n\u201cwouldn\u2019t be able to do\nanything\u201d, \u201cdemonstrate\nan animosity towards not\njust a Social Mobility\nOfficer by the work of\nLiberation Officers as a\nwhole.\u201d She added: \u201cMy\ncolleagues have done\nabsolutely fantastic work\nthis year, and to hear their\nwork dismissed during\nthis meeting was incredibly insulting not just to\nthem, but to all of us who\nwork to make the campus\nmore inclusive.\u201d\nThe Liberation Review,\nwhich is being carried\nout this academic year, is\nlooking at the structure\nof the liberation aspect of\nImperial College Union.\nO\u2019Connor told Felix: \u201cThe\nproposed extension to our\nliberation & community\nofficers should be based\non a partnership with the\nstudents it would repre-sent, to do justice to our\nstrategic values: democra-cy, inclusivity, leadership\nand partnership.\u201d\nThe percentage of Oxbridge entrants from state schools has gradually increased // Wikipedia\nJoanna Wormald\nDeputy Editor\n\"The NSS\nhas been\ndiscredited\nas a measure\nof assessing\nteaching\nquality\"\n\"I want\nstudents to\nhave a voice\nand be heard\nin the corridors\nof power\"\n\"Funding will\nunlock the\ninnovations\nthat will help\npeople live\nbetter, longer\nlives\" \u201cImperial's\nentry rate\nfor students\nwas eleven\ntimes higher\nfor those\nfrom well-off\nbackgrounds\u201d\nData from university\nadmissions body UCAS\nreveals, that for 70 out of\n132 institutions analysed,\npeople from well-off\nbackgrounds are twice as\nlikely to attend university\nthan those from disadvantaged neighbourhoods.\nTen universities had a\nratio of more than 9:1.\nImperial\u2019s entry rate for\nstudents from advantaged\nareas was eleven times\nhigher than for disadvantaged students.\nThis is the first time\nneither Oxford nor\n\u201cThe paper,\nwhich\nproposed a\nWorking Class\nLiberation\nOfficer, was\nvoted down\u201d\nimportant objective more\neffectively.\u201d O\u2019Connor\ncited debates at other\nstudent unions, which\nsuggested \u201cthe role would\nbe tokenistic at best, and\nwould function more to\nsingle out than to represent\u201d.\nShervin Sabeghi, the\nRoyal College of Science\nUnion (RCSU) Welfare\nOfficer, was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d by the Council\nresponse to the paper.\n\u201cThe general\ndialogue, not a mono-logue, so I\u2019m looking\nforward to discussing\ntuition fees, safe spaces,\naccess to higher educa-tion, and our potential\npost-Brexit, in a robust\nand honest fashion.\u201d\nIt is not known whether\nGyimah spoke with any\nstudents during his visit to\nImperial.\n\n"

Films that eschew\npolitical commentary\n\u2013 such as The Shape of\nWater, whose prominent\nposition in Oscar nominations led Peter Bradshaw\nto describe the list as\n\u2018cautious, comfort food\u2019\n\u2013 are accused of ignoring\nthe realities outside for\nsomething indulgent;\nthose that hit us over the\nhead with dark messages\nabout the Trump presiden-cy, meanwhile, such as\nThe Final Year, are seen\nas simplistic.\nAnd then there is The\nPost: Steven Spielberg\u2019s\nprestige drama about\nthe unveiling of the\nPentagon Papers by The\nWashington Post has been\nacclaimed by many Goldilocks-like film critics as\n\u2018just right\u2019 for the level\nof scorn it directs at the\nTrumpian White House.\nNumerous commentators\nhave seen links between\nthe political landscape\ndepicted on screen \u2013 the\nhostile, paranoid 1970s,\nduring which Nixon was\nitching to prevent state\nsecrets about the futility\nof the Vietnam War from\ngetting out \u2013 and today\u2019s\natmosphere \u2013 equally\nhostile, equally paranoid,\nand with a penchant for\njust ignoring the news\nrather than suppressing\nit. Despite taking place\nnearly 50 years ago, many\nhave said that it might as\nwell have taken place in\n2017.\nExcept\u2026 it really\ncouldn\u2019t. The Post is a\nfilm completely in thrall\nto the 1970s, and \u2013 in\nparticular \u2013 to the newspaper industry as it was\nthen, a world of clacking\ntypewriters and hot metal\ntypesetting. It\u2019s in this\nmilieu that Spielberg\nfocuses on his two central\ncharacters: Katharine\nGraham (Meryl Streep),\nthe publisher of The\nWashington Post, who\ntook on the role following\nher husband\u2019s suicide;\nand Ben Bradlee (Tom\nHanks) the paper\u2019s editor\nwho is keen to make it\nmore than just a small-time outlet. Luckily, that\nopportunity lands right on\nhis desk, when a copy of\na secret government study\ninto the history of the\nVietnam Conflict \u2013 called\nthe \u2018Pentagon Papers\u2019 \u2013 is\ngiven to his news team.\nThe papers, which showed\nthat the government knew\nthat the war was unwinna-ble, had been published in\nThe New York Times until\nthey were prevented from\ndoing so by the govern-ment. And so Graham and\nBradlee are faced with a\nsingle immense decision:\nto publish or perish.\nSpielberg surrounds\nthis with a whole retinue\nof creative packaging,\nadding in subplots about\nGraham\u2019s relationship\nwith the American estab-lishment, and The Washington Post\u2019s imminent\npublic offering. Spielberg\ndecides, however, to keep\nmost of the focus on the\ncentral pairing, and it\u2019s a\nwise choice, since it can\nbe difficult to care about\nthe surrounding baggage.\nStreep and Hanks are similarly supported by one\nof the most star-studded\ncasts I have ever seen in\na film \u2013 particularly good\nturns come from Carrie\nCoon, Sarah Paulson, and\nAlison Brie, who draw\nattention in a way that is\nimpossible not to notice.\nWith The Post we have\na director at the top of his\ngame, working with two\nof the most well-respect-ed actors; all three are\nindustry veterans, and as a\nresult The Post never feels\nanything short of profes-sional. From the three act\nstructure to the moving\nspeeches, it hits all the\nnotes you would expect\nit to along its two-hour\nruntime.The main issue is,\nhowever, that the subject\nmatter is simply not as\nexciting as we might hope\nit to be. Unlike Spotlight,\nanother drama centred\naround contentious stories\n\u2013 in this case the sexual\nabuse scandal that rocked\nthe Catholic church in\nBoston \u2013 The Post is\nfocussed on the process\nof publication, and not\non the inner workings\nof journalism. The team\nat The Washington Post\ngo to no great pains to\nuncover the papers \u2013 they\nare simply dropped in the\noffice one day \u2013 meaning\nthat the main decision\nis simply whether or\nnot they\u2019re going to risk\nlitigation and publish.\nAnd they do \u2013 a fact that\nI believe the vast majority\nof the viewers will enter\nthe cinema knowing. As\nsuch, The Post is starved\nof the oxygen of frisson\nand intrigue that made\nSpotlight so successful.\nLong scenes are taken up\nwith Graham agonising\nabout what the right thing\nto do would be, meaning\nthat once the papers have\nbeen published we\u2019re\ntreated to a whistle-stop\ntour of the ensuing legal\nbattle \u2013 while skipping\nover the fact that Daniel\nEllsberg, the official who\nleaked the papers, was\nsentenced to 115 years in\nprison.\nWhile The Post is certainly a well-made film\n\u2013 well-acted, well-shot,\nwell-scored \u2013 it fails to\nreach the levels many had\nhoped it would. Spielberg\nhas attempted to wrap a\ntraditional investigative\njournalism film around a\nstructure that is actually\nabout publishing. One of\nthe main risks is that the\ninvestors will pull out and\nGraham will have to sell\nthe company; one of the\nmain goals is to elevate\nThe Washington Post\u2019s\nstanding to more than a\nlocal paper. The result is\nan enjoyable watch that\nleaves little trace in the\nimagination.\nSteven Spielberg\u2019s prestige drama is nothing short of professional, but lacks frisson and excitement.\nDid you know that Meryl Streep invented journalism? // Universal\nFILM\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nDir: Steven Spielberg.\nScript: Liz Hannah; Josh\nSinger.

But it is important\nto remember Pizza\u2019s glorious roots \u2013 Italy.\nFor a long time it was\ntrue that no-one could\nmake a pizza quite like\nthe Italians; however, it\nseems that a number of\nambitious young chefs\nwere aware of this fact and\nactually travelled to Italy\nto learn from the great\nmasters. As a result the\npizza market has changed\ndramatically in the past\nfew years, with the likes\nof Pizza Pilgrims and\nFranco Manca serving up\nNeapolitan-style pizzas in\nmultiple locations around\nLondon. The success\nof such establishments\nshows that we will always\nhunger for pizza, but the\nreal question is how they\ncompare to a true Italian\npizzeria. Fortunately\nthat is where L\u2019Antica\nPizzeria da Michele steps\nin. A direct import from\nNaples \u2013 the birthplace of\nPizza \u2013 l\u2019Antica promises\nto bring the best pizza\nlocation has been a local\nfavourite since opening\nin 1870 (!) and recently\namassed a major following due to its cameo in the\n2010 Julia Roberts film\nEat, Pray, Love. With this\nnatural publicity, l\u2019Antica\nmerely had to find a new\nlocation and wait for the\npizza/film lovers to arrive.\nAnd that is precisely what\nhappened \u2013 but is it really\nworth the hype?\nFirst Impressions\nAfter trekking all the\nway to Stoke Newington\nwe arrived at a very unassuming looking restau-rant, quietly announcing\nits presence with a small\nlight blue sign. The inside\nwas also very understated,\nwith a cafeteria-style\ndecor rather than a proper\ndinner restaurant. The\nwalls were rather bare and\nwhite, painted with quotes\nfrom Eat, Pray, Love and\nItalian sayings. At the\nback a large stone pizza\noven was visible, with\nchefs bustling around\nit, speedily making the\npizzas. A waiter approached us and we were\ntold that we would have\nto wait 15 minutes for a\ntable. Bearing in mind that\nit was rather early (around\nfive pm) I was quite surprised that it was already\nso busy, but I managed to\ncontain my hunger and\nwait patiently until we\nwere shown to our table.\nWe were brought upstairs\nto a small room with a\nsimilar vibe to the down-stairs, although it was less\nbuzzy.\nThe Food\nThe menus stuck to\ntwo classics, Marinara or\nMargherita, demonstrating l\u2019Antica\u2019s attention\nto creating something\nperfect. I decided to go for\na Margherita. The pizzas\narrived relatively quickly\nand were piping hot\nwith a rich bready smell.\nThey had a classic Italian\nNeapolitan look: slightly\ncharred basil on top of\na bright red sauce and a\ngolden crust with flecked\ndark spots. I could hardly\nhold myself back so I\npulled out a slice and took\na bite. The tart tomato\nsauce was the first flavour\nthat burst into my mouth.\nI could really taste the\nfresh sweet tomatoes, and\nalmost felt transported to\na summer\u2019s day in Italy.\nThe mozzarella was soft\nand rich balancing the\nsoft, warm crust. Overall\nit was a real Italian experience and certainly filled\nmy pizza craving.\nFood writer Bl\u00e1ith\u00edn Dockery looks for the best pizza in the world\u2026 could it possibly be in Stoke Newington?\nThese pictures are making me pretty hungry // L\u2019Antica Pizzeria da Michele\nWorth the hype?\nSadly no. Although l\u2019Antica Pizzeria da Michele\nserves up gorgeous authentic Italian pizzas the hype\nsurrounding the restaurant was rather exaggerated.\nDespite the number of years l\u2019Antica has spent\nperfecting their recipes and sourcing the finest\ningredients, the competition for Neapolitian Pizza\nis really heating up, so it may be more difficult to\njustify travelling to Stoke Newington when there\u2019s\na Franco Manca round the corner!\nPrice\n\u00a37.90 for a Pizza Margherita\nBest part\nThat perfect tangy tomato sauce\nWorst part\nLocation\n\u201cA direct\nimport from\nNaples, l\u2019Antica\npromises to\nbring the\nbest pizza\nfrom Italy to\nthe rather\nmodest Stoke\nNewington\u201d\nfrom Italy to the rather\nmodest Stoke Newington. L\u2019Antica\u2019s original\nExams have finished: here comes the emperor!\nexams, we\u2019ve got you\ncovered!\nFelix knows that going\nout is the best kind of\ncelebration, but here are\nsome (not-so-easy, but\nDELICIOUS) recipes\nyou can enjoy on a lazy\nSunday. If you don\u2019t trust\nMarillenkn\u00f6del\nYou will need...\n\u2022 300 g low fat quark\n\u2022 200 g flour\n\u2022 ~60 g butter (room temperature)\n\u2022 Vanilla sugar\n\u2022 1 egg\n\u2022 Pinch of salt\n\u2022 10 small apricots\n\u2022 10 sugar cubes (if you want\nthem extra-sweet)\n\u2022 Breadcrumbs\n\u2022 Butter\n\u2022 Cinnamon powder\n\u2022 Icing sugar\n1. Mix the room temperature butter with the vanilla sugar and a pinch\nof salt until it gets creamy.\n2. Stir in the egg, the quark, and the flour until you get a malleable\ndough. I know I say it all the time, but you might need to adjust the\nquantities a little bit so your dough is not too sticky or too hard.\n3. Wrap the dough in film and let it rest for 30 minutes at least \u2013 time\nto play some games, isn\u2019t it? No!\n4. While the dough sits, you should take the stones out of the apricots\nand replace them with the sugar cubes \u2013 just imagining all the sugar\nmelting when you start cooking them makes me drool a little bit.\n5. On a floured surface, shape the dough into cylinders with a diameter of ~5cm and then cut it into slices. Flatten the slices in your hand,\nthen place the apricot into the dough, press it around and seal well\n\u2013 and you will use your first attempt to see exactly how big the next\nslices should be. In the end, they should look like dumplings.\n6. In a saucepan, bring some water to boil. Place the dumpling in\nwater and allow to simmer for 10-15 minutes \u2013 stir from time to time,\nso they don\u2019t stick to one another.\n7. In a separate pan, melt the butter. Add the breadcrumbs and cinna-mon, and fry until golden. Add sugar and stir gently. Turn off the heat\nand add the dumpling into the prepared mixture. Roll it around so the\nbreadcrumb mixturesticks to the dumpling.\n8. Finally, dust with icing sugar!\n9. P.S. It\u2019s ok if for your first try the dumpling fall apart, but they\nshouldn\u2019t. this will happen if the dough was not prepared perfectly!\nFOOD\nAndrada Balmez\nFood Editor\nKaiserschmarrn\nYou will need...\n\u2022 6 eggs\n\u2022 380 mL milk\n\u2022 200 g flour\n\u2022 3 tbsp granulated sugar\n\u2022 Raisins\n\u2022 Vanilla sugar\n\u2022 Rum\n\u2022 Lemon rind\n\u2022 Pinch of salt\n\u2022 50 g butter\n\u2022 Icing sugar\n\u2022 Cinnamon\n1. Separate the eggs and start mixing the yolks. Add the milk, some\nvanilla sugar, rum (a bit!) and grated lemon rind \u2013 the more, the\nbetter, in my opinion. Mix some more. Once you got a homogenous\ncomposition, add the flour and mix until you get a smooth dough.\n2. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites with the granulated sugar\nand a pinch of salt until it starts forming firm peaks \u2013 this is way\neasier with a hand mixer; if you don\u2019t have one, you can try doing\nit just with some well-placed manpower, but I cannot imagine you\nsucceeding. Fold the beaten egg whites into the dough mix \u2013 use a\nspatula and be patient; if you hurry too much, you will end up ruining\nyour work.\n3. In a pan, let the butter melt and when it starts bubbling, pour\nin the dough and after couple minutes, add the raisins over the top.\nEven through they are in the original recipe, they are, in my opinion,\noptional \u2013 but that\u2019s just because I really don\u2019t like them.\n4. Cook until the underside is light brown and then turn over with a\nspatula and keep cooking until golden brown.\n5. Now, time for the really fun part! It\u2019s time to tear it into small\npieces (use your imagination for this, but remember that it\u2019s hot and\nyou probably still want to use your hands afterwards). When you are\nproud with your result, add some granulated sugar on top and cara-melise under the grill at a high heat.\n6. When served, dust with icing sugar and cinnamon. You can eat it\nwith marmalade, honey, or my favourite, maple syrup with ice-cream\n(I know somewhere out there an Austrian has died of shock because\nit is normally served with baked plums or fruit compote, but\u2026).\nI\nf you feel like you\nneed to celebrate\nbecause you\u2019ve just\nfinished your January\nme, one of them was the\nfavourite of Franz Joseph\n\u2013 so take his word for it,\nnot mine.\n\n"

TV writers and anime enthusiasts Mingrou Xie and Pavan\nInguva take you through their top picks for all tastes.\nTV\nMingrou Xie\nPavan Inguva\nTV Writers\n\u201cThe Gundam\nfranchise\nspans a few\ndecades and\nstill produces\nexcellent\nshows\u201d\nJ\napanese manga\nand anime has\nsomething for every-one: enchanting\nsoundtracks, remarkable\naesthetics and animation,\nnuanced and thought-pro-voking storylines, and\nmore. As a media form,\nit has always been bold\nand refreshing, pushing\nthe boundary on plots,\ncharacter development,\nand artistic styles to great\neffect. The industry\u2019s\nability to be dynamic and\nvibrant is evident in the\nsheer variety and quality\nof series ranging from\nthe highly popular and\nlengthy trinity: Naruto,\nBleach, and One Piece,\nto the more warm-hearted\nand cutesy short series\nabouthighschoolromance\nTsurezure Children. The\nfollowing anime series are\na sample of what we feel\noffer insightful perspectives to life and society\n\u2013 enthralling works that\nare worth a watch.\nviolence. Considering the\npossibility of bringing\nviolence into space at a\nstage where mankind is\nbeginning to explore the\ncosmos, Celestial Being,\na non-state actor with\nfour disproportionately\npowerful gundams, seek\nto stop all wars. As is with\nall gundam shows, if you\ncan find a HD version of\nthis, you are in for a visual\ntreat, with outstanding animation and high-voltage\nbattles involving interstellar fleets and overpowered\nmechas.\nThe show remarkably\nweaves together threads\nfrom a multitude of\ndimensions: pernicious\neffects of war, human\nevolution, contact with\nextra-terrestrials, energy\npolitics, the rule of law,\nand the abuse of power.\nThe way characters\n(conventional militaries,\nCelestial Being, and\nother non-state actors and\ncivilians) are developed in\nterms of their backstories\nand how they progress\nduring the series serve to\npoint out the different motivations for engaging in\nvarious courses of actions\nduring conflict. The sheer\ndiversity of people who\nhave experienced different\naspects of conflict serve\nto make the complex affair\nof conflict more relatable.\nTake Setsuna, the main\ngundam pilot, who was a\nchild solider brainwashed\ninto killing his parents or\nAndrei Smirnov, a soldier\nwho resents his father for\nhaving killed his mother\ndue to a tactical decision\n(both his parents were in\nthe military). On a larger\nscale, I enjoyed how the\nshow discusses big ideas,\nsuch as the appropriate\noutlook humanity needs\nto grow as a species or\nhow power is used/abused\nby different people and\nhow can we address it.\nWith such smooth storytelling across the scales, it\nmakes for a profound and\nenjoyable show to watch.\nPI\nMy Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU has a deft way with character development // Ai\nYoshimura\nDirector: Kei Oikawa. 13\nepisodes\nMY TEEN ROMANTIC\nCOMEDY SNAFU\nI started this anime\nseries half expecting a\ntypical sappy high school\nrom-com (which I enjoy\nas a guilty pleasure). But\ninstead it was a witty and\nincisive social commentary analysing the nature\nof human relationships\nand conceptions of the\nself. This is one of the\nfew shows where I would\nhave to take a break in\nthe middle of an episode\nbecause the dialogue\nwould get too real.\nWe are greeted by the\nmain character Hachiman\nHikigaya, a curmudgeon\nloner with a \u2018twisted\u2019\nworld view, who immediately sees the worst in\npeople and any situation\nhe is placed in. To help\nrehabilitate him, his\nteacher forces him to join\nthe school\u2019s volunteering\nclub whose sole member\nprior to this was Yukino\nYukinoshita, an attractive\nand multitalented loner\nwho alienated herself after\nseeing people\u2019s jealousy\nof her beauty and talents.\nThis club is a bit unique in\nthat it gets requests from\nthe other students, and the\nclub helps the requester\nto reach their goals.\nExamples of such requests\ninclude guidance on\nbaking, organising events,\nand even asking a girl out.\nEach episode showcases\nthe club\u2019s activities and\nthe interaction between\nour two loners and a host\nof other characters, each\nwith different attributes,\nsuch as Hikigaya\u2019s sister\nor Yui Yuigahama, who\nafter being the first character to request the club\u2019s\nservice decides to join as\na member.\nThe character evolution is well done, and\nit is quite endearing to\nsee both Hikigaya and\nYukino develop a sense\nof humanity. Hikigaya\u2019s\ninitial methodology for\nhelping\u2013whilstseemingly\nexpedient \u2013 usually incurs\na high personal cost which\nhe is willing to bear and/\nor often involves working\nwith darker aspects\nof people\u2019s psyche.\nHowever, he gradually\nsees that it doesn\u2019t work\nout or that he unknowingly hurts his friends\nby his self-immolation,\ncausing him to change\nEven ancillary characters\nhave deeper sides shown\nthroughout the show,\ncollectively helping the\nviewer become emotionally invested in the show.\nPI\nDirector: Seiji Mizushima.\n50 episodes\nMOBILE SUIT\nGUNDAM 00\nThe Gundam franchise\nspans a few decades and\nstill produces excellent\nshows. Gundam 00 is the\n11th series, and ran from\n2007-2009, with a total\nof 50 episodes spread\nover two seasons. Set in\na post-fossil fuel world,\nthree power blocs form,\neach with a space elevator\nequipped to harness solar\npower in space. Countries\npreviously dependent\non fossil fuels see their\nfortunes change, further\ndestabilising a world rife\nwith sectarian or drug\nDirector: Hiroshi\nNagahama. 46 episodes\nMUSHI-SHI\nMushi-Shi is one of the\nbest examples of storytelling through an anime\nor cartoon series. The\nstoryline, artwork, choice\nof music, and the character development are well\ndone, and work together\nharmoniously to delight\nthe viewer. The series\nconsists of 46 episodes\nspread over two seasons\n\u2013 season one released in\n2005 and season two in\n2014.\nMushi are a kind of primordial and ethereal life\nform. They interact with\nthe world as much as any\nanimal or plant would.\nHowever, the show\ntakes on a supernatural\nand surreal angle as the\nMushi are only visible to\na handful of people, many\nof whom are not even\nfamiliar with them, or\n\u2013 an anime for all seasons\n\u201cMushi-Shi\noften brings in\nheavy ideas,\ngiving the\nviewer food\nfor thought on\nmany issues\u201d\ntheir interaction with the\nnormal world is unusual\nand mythical. There\nare a group of people\ncalled Mushi-Shis who\nare trained in the ways\nof the Mushi and how\nto counteract the effect\nof potentially harmful\nMushis. The show follows\nMushi-Shi Ginko, who\nis unable to remember\nanything before the age\nof ten and tends to attract\nMushi to his location. As\nsuch, he is a wanderer, and\nmost of the time he serves\nto drive the plot forward\nas the show focuses on the\ninteraction of people with\nthe Mushi.\nEach episode is\nself-contained and typically starts with someone\nor a group of people\ninteracting with the Mushi\nin an unideal manner,\noften to their detriment.\nGinko then comes along\nand helps the people work\nthrough the seemingly\nmysterious ways of the\nMushi and generally helps\nto establish a suitable\nequilibrium. I quite enjoy\nhow the show does not\nshy away from tragic\nendings where appropriate\nand it makes the overall\nsituation a tad more re-alistic, as neither joy nor\ntragedy are forced. In the\nabstraction of the surreal,\nMushi-Shi often brings in\nheavy ideas, giving the\nof us. MX anime keeps your imagination active thinking\nabout what the protagonist\n(or maybe you, yourself?)\ncould have done to better\ncolour his campus life.\nFellow students, grab\nthe opportunity dangling\nin front of your eyes.\nThis anime will definitely\nbrighten up your monochromatic campus life!\nP.S. If you can\u2019t get\nenough of the animation,\nwatch Yoru ha Mijikashi\nArukeyo Otome. It is\nhelmed by the same staff\nthat did Tatami Galaxy,\nand features several well-placed references to the\nanime. MX\nof tea, this is the anime for\nyou. In a country where\nthe principle of Equivalent Exchange underlies\nalchemy, two brothers\u2019\njourney to find a solution\nto regain their body and\nlimbs lost to human trans-mutation, a forbidden\nalchemy. Along their ad-ventures, they uncover the\nsecrets behind the country\nand reach a horrific conclusion about the alchemy\nthey have been taking for\ngranted.\npresent themselves. That\nis just one of the messages\nconveyed through a\nblend of well thought out\ncharacters and intricate\nstorylines.\nOther highlights of the\nanime include an amazing\nsoundtrack (openings\nand endings especially),\nand that it stays true to\nthe original manga\u2019s art\nstyle and storyline. For\nthose who like the typical\nshounen style of action\nand friendship, FMA has\nplenty of it, yet manages\nto maintain a good balance\nbetween action sequences\nand thought-provoking\nmoments.\nAlthough the anime\ntells instead of shows at\nseveral points, and has\none too many flashbacks\nfor my liking (probably\nbecause it is a long series),\nit is otherwise a very good\nanime. Definitely give it a\nwatch!\n(If you prefer to skip\nthe flashbacks, you can\ntry the manga instead,\nwhich is more succinct.\nThe mangaka, Hiromu\nArakawa, also has two\nother good series under\nher belt: Silver Spoon and\nThe Heroic Legend of\nArslan.) MX\nTatami Galaxy makes use of bright visuals throughout // Masaaki Yuasa\nviewer food for thought\non issues such as the\nnature of the choices we\nmake or how we interact\nwith that which is outside\nDirector: Masaaki Yuasa. 11\nepisodes\nTATAMI GALAXY\nEver dreamt of a\nrose-coloured campus life\n- exciting club activities, a\nlovely girl/boyfriend, and\nmore? Ever wanted to redo\nyour university choices,\nerase those regrettable\nFacebook pictures, and\nstart everything all over\nagain?\nWell, Tatami Galaxy\n(Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei)\nis almost like a satirical\ncommentary of that dream\nof yours. It\u2019s about a bitter\nuniversity student (his\nname remains unknown\nthroughout) who is continually thrown back in\ntime to repeat his campus\nlife, as each time he\nregrets how he has lived\nit. A set of over-the-top\nand extremely lovable\ncharacters surround him\nin his \u2018quest\u2019, including\nhis devilish and only\nfriend Ozu who seems to\nthwart his every effort,\nand eighth year student\nHiguchi with his mysterious acts.\nThe anime is immensely quirky, bearing unique\ncolour schemes reminiscent of textile prints, and\nhumorous dialogue - more\noften than not a blunt\nand matter-of-fact monologue by the protagonist.\nFrequent anime watchers\nwill find it a breath of\nfresh air, whereas newcomers get to enjoy the\nmore artsy side of anime.\nThe opening song is also\nabsolutely adorable in my\nopinion.\nThere is one downside,\nin that some viewers\nmight consider the\nconstant repetition of the\nsame scenario boring,\nbut I personally felt that\neach story was unique and\nenthralling. All in all, the\nDirector: Naoyoshi\nShiotani; Katsuyuki\nMotohiro. 33 episodes\nPSYCHO PASS\nWith screenplay by the\nfamous Gen Urobuchi\n(screenwriter of Puella\nMagi Madoka Magica)\nand character designs by\nAkira Amano (mangaka\nof Katekyo Hitman\nReborn!), Psycho Pass is\na thought-provoking psychological thriller through\nand through.\nSet in the near dystopian future, everyone is\nassigned jobs and statuses\nbased on their Crime Coefficient, or tendency to\ncommit a crime. The start\nof the story sees a new\nofficer, Akane Tsunemori,\njoining the Public Safety\nBureau, which oversees\n\u2018neutralisation\u2019 of people\nwith high Crime Coefficients. Slowly, through\ndifferent encounters and\nseveral freaky incidents,\nshe discovers the darker\nside of what she once\nthought was a perfect\nsocietal infrastructure.\nPerhaps some of you\nmight be reminded of the\ndrama series Person of\nInterest. Psycho Pass is\nthat and more\u2014it raises\nquestions about morality,\nsociety, and humanity. If\nyour Crime Coefficient\nremains low, does it mean\nwhat you\u2019re doing is\nnot wrong? Should you\nalways protect the law? Is\nit right to judge a human\u2019s\nworth by their tendency to\ncommit crime? Should relationships be influenced\nby Crime Coefficients?\nUnfortunately, Psycho\nPass drags out the storyline in some places,\nand the illustration can\nbe shaky towards the end.\nHowever, the storyline\nis gripping, and will take\nyou on a whirlwind ride\nthrough what it means\nto be human and to be\n\u2018right\u2019. MX\nDirector: Yasuhiro Irie. 64\nepisodes\nFULLMETAL\nALCHEMIST\nBROTHERHOOD\nAn eight year old\nclassic, FMA still deserves\na shout out. If alchemy,\nconspiracy, and camaraderie sound like your cup\n\u201cAn eight year\nold classic,\nFullmetal\nAlchemist still\ndeserves a\nshout out\u201d\nI found the anime\ntruly riveting. One of the\nquestions the anime raises\n- what of equal value to\nyour desired result would\nyou sacrifice? - is perti-nently raised in different\ncharacters\u2019 goals in the\nstory, and you can see how\ntheir behaviours change\nas different scenarios\n\n"

The\nDepartment for Cancer\nand Surgery, part of\nImperial\u2019s Faculty of\nMedicine, states \u201cone of\nour major objectives is\nto enhance cancer prevention\u201d. The department\ncurrently has 29 research\ngroups working on cancer\nprevention, detection, and\ntreatment.\nIn a statement, ICSM\nHeart \u2013 an Imperial\nCollege Union society for\nthose interested in cardiology or cardiothoracic\nsurgery \u2013 told Felix: \"It\nhas been well-established\nthat both first- and sec-ond-hand smoking are\ndamaging to one\u2019s general\nhealth, and in particular\nto your cardiovascular\nsystem. There is no level\nat which smoking is safe\nand it kills a great number\nof people worldwide\nevery year. In our view,\nan institution committed\nto fighting diseases should\ndo so on all possible fronts\nand should consider its\ncorporate social respon-sibility. There are plenty\nproblems. One of the\nauthors of the paper,\nwhich was published in\nCardiology, said: \u201cThe\ntobacco industry\u2019s efforts\nat manipulating scientific\nliterature as a way to\nserve their economic and\npolitical needs continues\nto this day.\u201d\nACollegespokesperson\ntold Felix it was \u201cCollege\npolicy not to undertake\nresearch to develop or\npromote tobacco products\nor to directly invest in\ntobacco companies\u201d.\nWhile fund managers are\n\u201cinstructed not to directly\ninvest in tobacco compa-nies, some investments\nare in managed funds. The\nCollege and its external\nfund managers have no\ncontrol over the composition of those funds, which\nchange on a continual\nbasis.\u201d\nHowever, further\ninvestigation by Felix\nshowed a number of these\nfunds have consistently\nincluded tobacco in their\nportfolio. Fundsmith\nEquity Fund, for example,\ninto which Imperial has\ninvested since at least\n2013, has had significant\nholdings in tobacco since\nits establishment in 2010.\nImperial currently has\nover \u00a311 million invested\nin the fund, more than\ndouble what it had invested four years ago.\nFossil Fuels\nImperial was also found\nto have nearly \u00a39 million\ninvested in the fossil fuel\nindustry. \u00a36 million of this\nwas directly invested in\ncompanies supporting and\nundertaking coal, oil, and\ngas extraction; \u00a33 million\nwas through investment\nfunds.\nCurrently, the College\nhas over \u00a31.5 million\ndirectly invested in Royal\nDutch Shell, the 7th\nlargest producer of oil and\ngas worldwide. Shell has\npreviously been accused\nof collaborating with the\nNigerian government in\nthe torture and execution\nof activists, and crimes\nagainst humanity. A report\nby Amnesty International,\npublished last year, concluded Shell\u2019s conduct in\nNigeria \u201camounts to en-couraging, and, at times,\nfacilitating the horrific\ncrimes and abuses committed by the Nigerian\nsecurity forces\u201d.\nThe College also has\n\u00a3470,000 in Exxon Mobil,\nthe 4th largest oil and gas\nproducer. The company\nwas previously headed by\nRex Tillerson, who is now\nDonald Trump\u2019s secretary\nof state. As with Shell,\nExxon has been accused\nof facilitating human\nrights abuses across the\nworld. The oil company\nwas sued by eleven Indonesian villagers in 2001,\nwho claimed the company\nhired security forces to\nprotect their pipelines.\nOne complainant said the\nforces had \u201ctortured him\nfor several hours\u201d, during\nwhich time they \u201cbroke\nhis kneecap, smashed his\nskull, and burned him\nwith cigarettes.\u201d\nImperial has a further\n\u00a3280,000 in BP, \u00a3221,000\nin Phillips 66, and\n\u00a3100,000 in Cairn, as\nwell as \u00a33 million in other\nfossil fuel companies\nthrough investment funds.\nThese findings come a\nfew months after Imperial\ndramatically dropped in\ntheir ethical record. This\nyear Imperial slipped to\n141st\nout of 154 univer-sities, making it bottom\nof the Russell Group.\nImperial received a score\nof zero for ethical invest-ment, and People and\nPlanet reported Imperial\nhad accepted nearly \u00a324\nmillion in donations from\nthe fossil fuel industry\nbetween 2009-2014.\nWhile the overall\namount of direct funding\ninto fossil fuels has\ndropped by nearly\n\u00a3400,000 since last year,\nthe amount Imperial has\nin investment portfolios\nhas increased by over\n\u00a315 million. A significant\nnumber of these funds\ninclude fossil fuel companies within their port-folios, meaning indirect\ninvestments are likely to\nhave risen over the past\ntwelve months.\nThe issue of investments within the fossil\nfuel industry has come\nunder increasing scrutiny\nrecently, as more universities divest from fossil\nfuels. Divest Imperial,\nwhich recently presented\na petition to College\nsigned by 1,700 individuals calling on Imperial to\ndivest, said: \u201cIt's a scandal\nthat Imperial puts so much\nmoney into the pockets of\nthe planet's biggest carbon\nemitters. We will not stop\npressuring college until it\ncleans up its act, divests\nfrom fossil fuels, and\ninvests in the zero-carbon\nfuture we all want to see\u201d\nImperial also has a\nnumber of departments\ndedicated to sustainability and climate change,\nincluding the Centre for\nEnvironmental Policy and\nthe Grantham Institute for\nClimate Change. On its\nwebsite, College claims\nit \u201crecognises the effect\nthat (our) opportunities\nand activities have on\nthe environment\u201d, and\n\u201cseeks to establish an\nethos at all levels and in\nall departments towards\n\u201cImperial has\n\u00a31.5 million\ninvested in\nShell, who\nhave been\naccused of\ncrimes against\nhumanity\u201d\nthe People and Planet\nUniversity League Tables,\nwhich rank higher education institutions based on\nprotecting and improving\nthe environment.\u201d\nOne academic told\nFelix: \u201cIt is no secret\nthat Imperial has many\nfinancial connections with\nthe fossil fuel industry,\nsome of which support\nvaluable teaching and\nresearch necessary for\na low carbon transition.\nHowever, the College\nshould place stronger\nemphasis on research and\nteaching orientated on\nmitigating and adapting to\nenvironmental challenges\nlike climate change, air\nand water pollution, and\nrising sea levels rather\nthan prolonging the use\nof damaging fossil fuels.\nThe world looks to us to\nset the agenda of research;\nhow can we lead from the\nfront when our eyes are\nstill squarely focused on\nthe past and its former\ncash cows \u2013 fossil fuels.\u201d\nLike the tobacco\nindustry, a number of\nfossil fuel companies\nhave been accused of\npropagating misleading\nscience and data to install\n\u201cuncertainty\u201d in public\ndebate on climate change.\nExxon in particular knew\nabout the contribution of\ncarbon dioxide to global\nwarming since the 1970s,\nand instead \u201cworked at\nthe forefront of climate\ndenial\u201d.\nA College spokesperson told Felix: \u201cWe share\nthe concern that climate\nchange is one of society\u2019s\nmost important global\nchallenges. That\u2019s why\nwe are urgently working\nto find ways to mitigate\nthe impact of fossil fuels\nwhile seeking viable alternative sources of energy.\nWe believe that we can\nhave the greatest effect by\ncarefully optimising our\nendowment to invest in\nground-breaking research\nand education.\u201d\nWeapons\nThe analysis also\nrevealed the College is\ncurrently investing over\n\u00a33 million in arms compa-nies, the majority through\ndirect investments.\nImperial has invested\n\u00a32.2 million in Lockheed\nMartin, which is the\nlargest arms company\nin the world, with over\n$35 billion in sales. The\nmoney Imperial has been\ninvesting in Lockheed\nMartin has dramatically\nincreased since 2016,\nand now stands at nearly\ndouble what it was a year\nago.\nLockheed Martin developed the missiles used\nin the Trident nuclear\ndeterrent system, whose\nlifetime replacement costs\nhave been estimated to be\nas high as \u00a3205 billion.\nLockheed Martin is also\nresponsible for production\nof the Javelin and Hellfire\nmissiles, both of which\nwere heavily used during\nthe 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nThe university has a\nfurther \u00a3500,000 invested\ncompanies, including\nsome of the largest in\nthe world. \u00a39 million is\ndirect investments, while\n\u00a37.3 million is invested\nthrough investment port-folios.\nThe amount of direct\ninvestment has nearly\ndoubled since 2013,\nand includes \u00a32 million\nin Novartis, which last\nyear made $6.6 billion in\nprofits. Imperial also has\n\u00a31.25 million invested\ndirectly in Pfizer, and\nnearly one million pounds\ninvested in GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). In 2012,\nGSK was made to pay\n$3 billion in charges after\nthey were found guilty\nof failing to report safety\ndata and promoting drugs\nfor unapproved uses.\nWhile these pharmaceutical companies are\nresponsible for the development of new drugs,\nthere is concern about the\nrole public funding plays\nin funding drug creation\nthat disproportionately\nbenefits companies\u2019\nprofits.\nA 2017 report by\nSTOP AIDS and Global\nJustice Now found the\nUK government was the\nsecond largest funder\ncountry, after the USA,\nfor research and development into diseases\npredominantly affecting\npoor countries. However,\nthey pointed out \u201cthere is\nno guarantee that patients\nin the UK and beyond\nwill be able to access the\nmedicines at an affordable\nprice,\u201d and argued that\n\u201cin many cases the UK\ntaxpayer pays twice for\nmedicines: first through\ninvesting in R&D, and\nthen by paying high prices\nfor the resulting medicine\nonce ownership has been\ntransferred to a private\ncompany\u201d. In 2016/17,\nImperial received \u00a3143\nmillion in public funding\ngrants.\nFelix spoke to Universities Allied for Essential\nMedicines (UAEM), a\nstudent-led organisation\nthat lobbies to improve\naccess to medicines glob-ally: \u201cIf public institutions\nare to make investments\nin the stock market, it is\nobvious that this should\nbe done transparently, and\nwith robust safeguards\nagainst these financial\ninterests influencing what\nresearch is done, how\nresearch is done, and what\nis done with the research.\u201d\n\u201cThe research agenda\n\u2013 decisions on where\nresearch funding and\nefforts should be focussed\n\u2013 should be guided by\nthe public interest and a\nspirit of scientific inquiry.\nImperial has \u00a33 million in arms companies // Felix\n\u201cThe amount\ninvested in\nLockheed\nMartin has\ndoubled since\nlast year\u201d\nin Mitsubishi Heavy\nIndustries, which is the\nlargest arms company\nin Japan, responsible for\nover $3 billion worth of\narms sales.\nThe university also\nhas around \u00a3500,000\nin indirect investments,\nincluding funding to BAE\nSystems and Rolls Royce,\ntwo of the UK\u2019s largest\narms companies.\nPharmaceuticals\nFinally, the analysis revealed Imperial currently\nhas over \u00a316 million invested in pharmaceutical\n\u201cSome\nstudents were\nconcerned\nabout public\nfunding being\nused for\nbig pharma\nresearch\u201d\nStudents, scientists, and\nthe public should be wary\nof profit motives guiding\nresearch decisions.\u201d\nAs direct investments in Fossil Fuels have decreased,\nindirect investments in the industry have risen\nEndowment fund investments by industry (\u00a3m)\nSource: FOI\n2013\n2014\n2016\n2017\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\nDefence\nOilfield Services\nPharmaceuticals\nFossil Fuels\nOther\nInvestment Fund\nDirect investments in Fossil Fuels\nhave decreased from\n\u00a36.2m in 2013 to \u00a34.5m\n...but the total in Investment Funds\nhas risen to \u00a3131m, much of which is\ninvested in Fossil Fuels\n\u201cFurther\ninvestigation\nshowed\nsome of the\ninvestment\nfunds had\nincluded\ntobacco since\n2013\u201d\nof other ways to invest\nmoney sensibly.\u201d\nTobacco companies\nhave also been indicted\nin manipulating scientific\nresearch. A 2007 study\nfound tobacco companies\nfunded and used scientific\nstudies to undermine the\nlink between secondhand smoke and health\n\u201cIt is difficult to see\nhow conflict of interest\ncan be avoided by Imperial if it invests in the\nsame pharmaceutical\ncompanies that contribute\nto Imperial\u2019s research\nfunding, and companies\nthat may make profitable\nproducts out of Imperial\u2019s\ndiscoveries.\u201d\n\u201cLastly, Imperial lacks\na strong, public policy\nthat would ensure that\nany medicines developed\nusing the College\u2019s discoveries must be made\naccessible and affordable.\u201d\nWhen asked about the\nmakeup of the endowment fund, a College\nrepresentative told Felix:\n\u201c\u201cAs an organisation\nwith charitable status,\nwe have a responsibility\nto carefully manage our\nassets to maximise their\nlong term contribution\nto our academic mission.\nThis includes optimising\ninvestment return to\nsupport the College\u2019s\nresearch and teaching\nactivities.\u201d\n// Cale Tilford/@caletilford\nCont. from front\n\n"

Harry Brady\ndidn\u2019t take long to injure\nan opposition player, and\ndue to their lack of subs\nthey were down to 14\nmen. Poor discipline was\npreventing us from taking\nhold of the match. A neat\nbacks move opened up a\nhole for Jack Fraser, who\nran over in the corner for\nthe first try of the match.\n5-0toImperial.Aftersome\nnice offloads between the\ngiven ten minutes on the\nsidelines to reflect on his\nactions. Half-time came\nand went, and soon Elliot\nwas allowed back onto the\npitch. We knew we could\nbe playing better. A dangerous scrum, five metres\nfrom the opposition try\nline, gave the forwards\nan opportunity to show\neveryone how big they\nwere. The RUMS pack\nwas driven back over their\ntry line and Elliot touched\ndown on the ball for an\neasy try. 17-0. A scrum on\nthe halfway line allowed\nthe backs to show what\nthey could do. A perfectly\nexecuted \u2018whitey\u2019 ended\nup with the ball out wide.\nHugo Koide decided that\nthe 3v1 was too risky,\nso he took the ball into\ncontact and got tackled.\nLuckily, Sam Ha was\nthere in support for the\noffload and some quick\nhands put Sorrell over in\nthe corner. A conversion\nfrom Dan Kirrane made\nthe score 24-0.\nComplacency at having\nsecured a bonus point\nfor scoring four tries got\nthe better of some of us.\nRUMS were able to run\nagain by breaking tackles\nand pulling off some\nincredible offloads. Particular mention has to be\ngiven to Tom Johnston,\nwho managed to draw in\ntheir outside centre and\nwinger, one of which he\nwas pretty much giving\na piggyback to, and then\npass it out the back to\nHugo \u2013 without looking.\nEven their players were\nin disbelief. Hugo took\nthe ball into contact, again\ndeeming an overlap too\nrisky. Powerful running\nfrom our forwards\nallowed us to get close to\ntheir try line, and sneaky\nElliot dived through the\nmiddle of a ruck to score\nhis second try. Dan added\nthe extras to make it 31-7.\nA now-tired RUMS team\nkicked off again to us, and\nsome more good hands\ndown the wing quickly\nallowed Sorrell to score\nhis second try, making\nhim the second team\nmember eager to avoid\nscoring a hat-trick. Final\nscore 36-7 to Imperial.\nSylvia is back.\nICU 3rd\nXV achieve distinction\nW\nithnoleague\nfixture, the\nICU 3rd\nXV made\ntheir way down to the\nLondon Irish for a merit\ntournament. Winning\ntwo of their three games,\nthey earned just that.\nThe University of Arts\nbroke the trend as always,\narriving fashionably late\nand five players short. The\nopportunity was realised\nto volunteer Louis Benson\nto play for UAL \u2013 Si-Woo\nKim kept him company.\nA 12-aside game ensued,\nwith space to run on both\nsides. UAL made the first\nmark, but within a minute\nICU\u2019s debutant Sam\nMuirhead had got one\nback, breaking through\nthe UALline from his own\nhalf to score. Within three\nphases of the restart, ICU\nhad lost possession and\nSi-Woo Kim was breaking\nICU ankles, wherever he\npleased. Luckily, he of-floaded the ball to Benson,\nfrom whom possession\nwas quickly turned over.\nIn the broken play that\nfollowed, the ball ended\nup in Joao Pereira\u2019s hands\non the other side of the\npitch to score the try. Now\nUAL legs were tiring,\nand turnovers became\na regular occurrence.\nAlthough their fullback\nwas still running hard and\nfast, he could do nothing\nstop Hicks and Rudman\nboth running in to score to\nfinish them off. The final\nscore was 24-10.\nIn the second game of\nthe tournament ICU put up\na strong showing against a\nUniversity of Chichester\nside four leagues above\nthem. Despite ICU\u2019s\nefforts, they let in two tries\nand UCRFC won 10-0. In\nthe third and final game\nof the day, ICU faced the\nUniversity of Portsmouth.\nThis was a breeze, relative\nto the games beforehand.\nFrom kick-off, ICU\nwalked it up the pitch. The\nfirst successful chip and\nchase of the day, forced\nthe Portsmouth fullback to\ncarry the ball into touch.\nThe resulting line out,\nsaw Connor Crook carry\nthe ball over the line.\nPortsmouth were already\ntiring. Within two phases\nof kick-off, Morgan Ball\nhad broken through in the\nICU half and offloaded\nto flanker-turned-flyhalf\nJespersen to do the\nleg-work and score the\ntry. Somewhere along the\nline Rudman managed\nto get on the score sheet\nagain, in a rare manoeuvre\nto avoid hat-trick avoid-ance.

While\nher statement is highly\ndebatable, it is certain that\nfashion consciousness is\non the rise, leading to the\ngrowth of the hair dyeing\nindustry. However, except\nfor the chemists amongst\nus, people rarely put much\nthought into hair dyes.\nWhy should we?\nFirstly, there is much\nmore science involved\nin this industry than\nyou might imagine!\nPermanent dyes work\nby coupling precursors\nwith various molecules,\nso the resultant coloured\ncompounds are trapped in\nthe hair and are resistant\nto shampoo removal. On\nthe other hand, temporary\ndyes simply bond to the\nsurface of hair fibres, so\nthey are easily removed\nby shampoos.\nWhilst I appreciate not\nall readers are science\nenthusiasts, the newly\ngenerated Hair Dye Substance Database (HDSD)\nis equally fascinating to\nall \u2013 it has opened the\ndoor to designing greener\nand safer hair colourings.\nAlthough hair dyes\nare relatively safe, this\nmulti-billion-pound\nindustry constantly tries to\nimprove their products by\nscreening for chemicals\nthat may cause allergies.\nSome chemicals in hair\ndyes have also been\nlinked to water pollution,\nso sustainable and safer\ncompounds are always\nneeded. However, the\nresearch and development\nprocess can be lengthy\nand expensive, and this\nis where the database\ndeveloped by the North\nCarolina State University\ncan help.\nThe HDSD is a publicly\naccessible database that\nallows scientists to harvest\nthe power of computers to\nminimise the experimental\nwork required to develop\ncolour industry. Hence,\nthe research group in\nNorth Carolina creating\nthe HDSD via the compilation of 313 hair dye\nsubstances. The past\nand current commercial\nformulations of these\ncompounds were curated\nand classified according to\ntheir structural and physi-ochemical characteristics.\nBy employing an appropriate structural-property\nmodel, the HDSD could\nhelp scientists predict\ntoxicity, or skin sensitivity\nof different compounds.\nIn short, by manipulating\nand analysing the large\ndatabase of information,\nscientists can filter out the\nirrelevant molecules early\non, and focus resources\non the more promising\ntargets. Thereby, the\ndevelopment of new hair\ncolouring products can be\nfaster, cheaper, and more\nreproducible.\nNevertheless, there\nare limits to this technol-ogy. The computational\nmodels may not be able to\ndiscriminate strong/weak\nsensitizers, and the solvent\ninteraction cannot yet be\nfully simulated, thus the\naccuracy of the prediction\nis not completely perfect.\nYet, this study showed\ncheminformatics analyses\nare a promising way for a\nnew dye design. Furthermore, scientists can start\nto modify structures in the\ndye precursors to generate\nnovel hair colourings\nwith desirable qualities.\nIf proven successful, a\nsimilar methodology\ncould be used in designing\nother types of dyes too.\nSCIENCE\nSarah Wong\nScience writer\nHow does climate change\nimpact our mental health?\nThe Hidden Danger of\nSneezing!\nSCIENCE\nJuan Ignacio\nRubio Gorrochategui\nScience writer\nSCIENCE\nCaroline Wolfe\nScience writer\nI\nn a world where\nenormous amounts\nof information are\nprovided nonstop via\n24-hour television channels and digital media, it\nshould not be surprising\nto find that news have a\nprofound effect on mental\nwellbeing. Accounts of\nwar and extreme poverty\nare already concerning for\na significant part of the\ngeneral public; however,\nall these problems pale\nin comparison to climate\nchange.\nMany people cannot\navoid feeling some kind\nof existential angst when\nthey are confronted with\nimages of starving polar\nbears, melting glaciers,\nand tiny tropical atolls\nbeing devoured by increasing sea levels. Now,\nnew research addresses in\ndetail the different ways\npeople react to global\nwarming, exploring the\nimplications this phenomenon has for public policy\nin the fight against this\nchallenge.\nThe study was carried\nout by researchers at the\nUniversity of Arizona\nusing a sample size of\n342 individuals. They\nclassify the environmen-tally-concerned segment\nof the population, as\nthose who are \u201caware of\nenvironmental problems\nand support efforts to\nsolve them and/or indicate\na willingness to contribute\npersonally to the solution\u201d\nin three categories:\negoistic, social-altruistic,\nand biospheric. Egoistic\nindividuals focus on the\neffects climate change will\nhave on their own lives;\nsocial-altruistic people\nare more concerned\nabout the impact on the\ngeneral society, while\nthe biospheric segment is\nmore concerned about the\ncolossal loss of wildlife\nand habitat degradation\nthat is entailed in a pessimistic climate scenario.\nEach of the groups both\nshow different levels of\nstress and anxiety, and\nexpress it in different\nways. Therefore, their\npsychological coping\nstrategies and \u2018Pro-Environmental Behaviour\u2019\n(PEB) show significant\ndifferences.\nThe group whose\nmental health was taking\nthe biggest toll due to\nclimate change was the\nbiospheric portion. They\nwere more likely to show\nsymptoms of depression\nand stress, and they had\nthe strongest tendency for\nPEB. They were also the\nmostpronetousingcoping\nmechanisms in order to\nreduce their anxiety, e.g.\nwishful thinking about the\nrelative unimportance of\nthe whole phenomenon.\nThe social-altruistic\ngroup, while less psychologically affected\nby climate change, still\nshowed some degree of\necological coping and\nPEB. The section of the\npopulation which had\nclearly experienced the\nlowest levels of anxiety\nwere the one formed by\negotistic individuals.\nThe study stressed that\necological anxiety was not\nthe only variable behind\nPEB, and that positive\necological coping strategies (e.g. becoming more\naware of one\u2019s role in\nstopping climate change\nand changing one\u2019s\nlifestyle on this premise)\nwere much more impor-tant. Thus, the article\nrecommends addressing\nthe egotistic segment of\nthe population in future\nmessaging campaigns\nagainst climate change,\nas \u201capproaches that focus\non concern for all life on\nthe planet increase the risk\nassociated with delaying\nclimate change adapta-tion, exacerbating the\npotential for large-scale\nnegative mental health\neffects in our society\u201d.\nE\nveryone has\nsomeone in\ntheir life with\nan obnoxiously\nloud sneeze that he or she\nwishes they would at least\ntry to stifle. As it turns out,\nstifling sneezes by pinching the nose shut with the\nmouth closed can actually\nbe dangerous.\nDoctors at the Department of Head and Neck\nSurgery at the University\nHospitals of Leicester\nreported a case of a stifled\nsneeze so violent that it\ncaused spontaneous perforation of the pharynx \u2013 an\narea of the back of throat\n\u2013 leaving its victim barely\nable to speak or swallow.\nThis type of injury is most\noften caused by trauma\nto the back of the throat,\nwhich indicates that the\nforces produced during a\n\u2018held-in\u2019 sneeze can rival\nthose felt in a blunt trauma\nto the neck. The man\nsuffered from a perfora-crackling sounds were\nheard in the man\u2019s neck\nall the way down to his\nribcage. A CT scan further\nverified the existence of\nair bubbles that had penetrated the muscles of the\nchest, otherwise known\nas cervical subcutaneous\nemphysema. Due to risk\nof infection, the man was\nadmitted to the hospital\nwhere he was tube-fed\ndue to the pain associated\nwith swallowing and\nadministered preventative\nantibiotics.\nOther than a blunt\ntrauma to the neck,\nspontaneous perforation\nof the pharynx is thought\nto occur due to a sudden\nincrease in intraluminal\npressure in the oesophagus\nor pharynx. Infrequently\nit occurs due to forceful\ncoughing or retching\nand is rarely caused by\nholding in a sneeze.\nIncreased intraluminal\npressure due to pinching\nthe nose shut and closing\nthe mouth during sneezing\ncan also cause rupture of\nthe eardrum \u2013 and rupture\nof cerebral aneurysms in\nthe worst cases! Doctors\nwarn that sneezing in this\nfashion is dangerous and\nshould not be done. So,\nthink twice before stifling\nthat fifth-in-a-row sneeze\nor scolding your friend for\na loud sneeze as you just\nmay find one of you two\nin the emergency room.\n\u201cHe described\na popping\nsensation\nin his throat\nfollowed by\nneck swelling\nso severe\nhe could\nbarely talk or\nswallow\u201d\ntion of his pharynx, more\nspecifically his pyriform\nsinus, which is at a higher\nrisk of rupture due to\nthe lack of a secondary\nsupportive muscular\nlayer.

Individuals of\nalmost every species compete for resources such as\nmating sites, partners, and\nfood. The competition is\nfierce \u2013 often involving\nphysical conflict with\ncostly outcomes. Due to its\ncosts, individuals assess\nthemselves and their\nopponent\u2019s \u2018Resource\nHolding Potential\u2019 (RHP)\nto minimise damage and/\nor the need for conflicts.\nMantis shrimps are\nknown to compete for\nburrow sites used for\nfeeding, mating, breeding\nand refuge from preda-tion. Conflict occurs in\nboth sexes, using striking\nsecond maxilliped appendages \u2013 regions of the\nmouthparts \u2013 to deliver\nhigh power strikes, and\nstabbing to puncture the\nopponents. Furthermore,\nTelson sparring \u2013 where\nindividuals strike each\nother on their heavily\narmoured tail plates \u2013 also\noccurs.\nA recent study examining conflicts in mantis\nshrimps (Neogonodacty-lus bredini) tried to determine what assessment\nmodels they use when\ndetermining RHP to\nchoose whether to engage\nin a contest for resources.\nThree models exist: pure\nself-assessment, cumulative assessment and\nmutual assessment. Pure\nself-assessment involves\nan individual assessing\ntheir personal RHP, with\nthe loser stopping the fight\nonce self-inflicted costs\nreach a critical threshold.\nCumulative assessment\ninvolves an individual\nassessing themselves\nand their competitor\u2019s\nRHP, with the loser\nforfeiting once self and\nopponent-inflicted costs\n(physical injury) reach a\ncritical threshold. Finally,\nin mutual assessment\nan individual assesses\nboth their own and their\nopponent\u2019s RHP, with the\nloser bowing out when\nthey realise they are of a\nlower competitive ability\nthan their opponent.\nThe study involved\nplacing two individuals,\nresident and intruder,\nwhich were matched by\nbody length and mass,\nin an arena containing a\nburrow.\nwas defined as the individual that obtained the\nburrow after the contest.\nContests between\nN. bredini occurs in\nescalating stages includ-ing: eye tracking and\napproaching; visual or\nchemosensory behaviour;\nTelson sparring; and\ncontest resolution. The researchers discovered that\nburrow residency status\n\u2013 i.e. resident vs intruder\n\u2013 was as important in\nthe contest outcome. In\nrandom contests, resident\nindividuals had a 49.6%\nRHP advantage compared\nto others, while in body-type matched contests\nresidents had only a\n9.7% RHP advantage.\nSimilarly, body mass was\nan important determinant\nof contest outcome, with\nlarger individuals able to\nproduce stronger strikes.\nTelson sparring was\nused by individuals for\nassessment and contest\nsettling without death or\ninjury by comparing body\nmass and RHP. Based on\nthese results and through\ntheir analytical methods,\nresearchers were able\nto conclude that mantis\nshrimps use the mutual\nassessment model, ruling\nout the pure self and\ncumulative assessment\nmodels.\nThis study resolves\ncontroversy around the\ntype of experimental\ntechnique to employ when\nresearching contests: a\ncombination of corre-lational and sequential\nanalysis is recommended\n,ensuring strong empirical\ntesting that may be used\nin future contest studies.\nSCIENCE\nIgnatius-Roy\nHillcoat-Nalletamby\nScience writer\nConnect with conservation \u2013 successes in 2017\nSCIENCE\nSteve Allain\nScience Writer\n2\n017 was a peculiar year for us\nall, with world\npolitics turned\non its head, as well as\nthe United States of\nAmerica pulling out\nof the Paris Climate\nAgreement. None of\nthis seemed to phase the\npassionate and dedicated\nconservationists working around the clock to\nensure that their species\nof choice would be here\nfor future generations\nto enjoy. To fill you all\nwith optimism moving\ninto 2018, here are a few\nstories from the past year\nwhich highlight the fact\nthat we are indeed on the\nright track.\nOne of the most\nshocking announce-ments, which took me\nby surprise, was China\u2019s\ndecision to shut down\nthe ivory trade within the\ncountry. China put a huge\namount of pressure on\nelephants for their ivory\nfor both medicinal and\ndecorative purposes. This\nban does not necessarily\nmay just have a chance to\nbounce back!\nA recent survey of the\nlittle-known Indus River\ndolphin from Pakistan\nturned up some very\npositive results. Scientists\nsurveyed the dolphins\nover a month-long period,\nand now estimate that\nthere are 1,816 individual\ndolphins remaining in\nPakistan. These numbers\nare anything but com-pelling, but it is great\nnews considering that\nwhen the first census\nwas completed in 2001,\nthere were estimated to\nbe only 1,200 dolphins\nremaining. This is a 50%\nincrease in numbers!\nDespite this, the dolphins\nare still listed as endangered on the International\nUnion for Conservation\nof Nature Red List due\nto the growing threats of\nhabitat loss, pollution, and\ndrowning in nets. There\nis clearly still a lot to be\ndone, but conservation\nefforts are moving in the\nright direction.\nA study published in\nSeptember analysed the\npopulation trends of the\nworld\u2019s seven sea turtle\nspecies and showed something truly amazing. The\nnumbers of sea turtles as a\nwhole are growing, which\nhas further been helped\nby years of conservation\nefforts that have played a\nkey role in the recovery\nof their population. Sea\nturtles have historically\nsuffered population\ndeclines due to hunting,\naccidental capture,\ndrowning in fishing nets\nand the illegal harvesting\nof eggs. Again, this is very\nencouraging news, but we\ncannot grow complacent.\nConservation depends on\nthe ongoing commitment\nand collaboration of\nmultiple parties to ensure\ntheir hard work is not\nundone. You do not have\nto be a conservation\nbiologist to make a\ndifference: being active\nin your local community\nwith conservation work\ncan contribute to larger\ngoals. Maybe in 2019,\nwhen we are looking\nback at 2018, a project\nyou were involved in\nwill be highlighted.\nThe elephants could make a comeback after China banned the ivory trade // CC\n\u201cIf the Chinese\nauthorities are\ncommitted to\nenforcing their\nban on ivory,\nelephants\nmight bounce\nback!\u201d\nhalt the trade of ivory due\nto lucrative black markets,\nbut if the Chinese authorities are committed to\nenforcing the new laws,\nthen perhaps elephants\n\u201cContests\nbetween\nthe mantis\nshrimp occur\nin a series of\nescalating\nstages\u201d\nContests were analysed\nusing correlational and sequential analysis methods\nto determine which of the\nthree models were used by\nthe shrimps.
