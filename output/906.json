Even if you find a place, it is\nnot always very welcoming. Consequently,\none of our aims as Chaplains is to\nencourage community. We run several\nstudent houses where students don't just\nhave four walls to go home to, but a community to live in. This is forged by a weekly meeting to discuss relationships and\nany day to day matters, like shopping and\nrent payment. Houses agree to eat their\nmain evening meal together each day (more\nor less). Each house goes away on a weekend early in the new term to forge\nbetter relationships.\nThere are two ways in which this might\ninterest you. Firstly, we have one or two\nplaces left, and you may wish to apply.\nSecondly, you may already be in a flat with\nfriends and want to explore the idea of\ncommunity for yourselves, but want advice.\nEither way, we hope that your student days\nwill be enhanced.

In the\nlong term I suspect that this will have a broader impact on college life as a whole\nthan any other of the proposals.\nThis seems a very peculiar approach to\ntake when so many staff at the college do\ntheir utmost to try and integrate the\ncommunity, from the tutorial group at an\nacademic level, through to HUB and\nUnion activities at a social level. This,\ntoo, at the very time in life that it is\nbeneficial for students to broaden their\nexperience and contact with a wide\nvariety of people, so fitting them better\nfor employment.

    "content": "Access Bill\nImperial College in common with other\ninstitutions is awaiting government\nconfirmation of next year's Access Fund\ngrant. The finance department at UCL has\nalready made some approximate\ncalculations based on information within\nthe parliamentary publication , Hansard.\nMr Phibb's, in charge of UCL access fund\npredicts a0.05% reduction from 324,800\nto approximately 307,800. The reduction\nin funds awarded to institutes of further\neducation reflects the governmental\ndecision to award money to places of\nhigher education with no overall increase\nin funds.\nThe projected decrease in funds has\nfurther inflamed the controversy about\ntheir distribution to students.Lead by the\nvice-provost UCL has decided to set aside\nSI00,000 purely for post graduates.\nAccording to Anna Laslett of Pi magazine\n, UCL's student newspaper, the decision\nwas motivated by fears that research\nplaces would not be taken up and thus\nfurther funds from the University Funding\nCouncil (UFC) would be lost. The financial\nburden of research students is shared by\nthe research councils (SEC and NARC)\nwho pay the students themselves and by\nthe UFC that pay for teachers and\nfacilities. Broadly if research places are\nnot filled individual departments lose UFC\nfunds.\nTony Cullen, in charge of the IC access\nfund, confirmed that Imperial is\nconsidering earmarking some funds for\nstudents new to Imperial; both\nundergraduate and postgraduate.\nAlthough the scheme would be seen as a sort of bursar y they would not be\nawarded on academic merit but on\nfinancial need. Mr Cullen said he wanted\nto 'keep academic record out of it.' Mr\nCullen felt that although Imperial did not\nhave a problem 'attracting students'\nprospective students with financial\nworries would find additional financial\nassistance attractive.\nFinancial assistance on top of the\nstandard grant is not a new phenomenon.\nIndustrial sponsorship for mechanical\nengineers is of course common place. A newer development is Geology's undertaking to award 30 bursa ries of\nS600 each to next year's undergraduate\nintake. Professor Richard Selley, head of\nthe Geology department, said that the\nbursa ries are being funded by oil\ncompanies and privately by members of\nstaff. Although applications were up on\nlast year take up of places was down.\nThis pattern has also been seen in other\ndepartments and its cause is as yet\nunclear. There is some suggestion that\ninterviewing coincided with the IRA\nbombing campaign in London at the\nbeginning of the year and this combined\nwith the college's proximity to the Iraqi\nembassy contributed to prospective\nstudents fears about living in London.\nMary's on the Block\nClaims by the health service watchdog\ngroup 'London Health Emergency' that St\nMary's hospital will shed up to 400 jobs in\nthe next five years have been\nvehemently denied by the hospital\nauthorities. St Mary's is considering\nbecoming a self-governing trust under the\nrecently introduced opting out policy.\nSeparate to these deliberations the\nhospital is undergoing a restructuring\nprocess. Phase 2 of the restructuring\ninvolves the amalgamation of St Mary's with two other London hospitals; the\nSamaritan and Western Ophthalmic\nHospitals. According to a hospital\nspokeswoman the much talked of 10%\nreduction in staff involves St Mary's staff\nonly. Spokesman for the action group, Mr\nJeff Martin, described by St Mary's as\n'..quasi political', said that in the original\ndiscussion document the 10% applied to\nall three hospitals. The hospital claim that\nthe figure applied to only St Mary's was,\nhe said, '... incorrect and misleading.'\nIf staffing levels at St Mary's are\nsignificantly reduced patient care and\ntraining will be put in jeopardy, claims Mr\nMartin. It is the government's intention ,\nsays Mr Martin '...to close one London\nteaching hospital'. He expects the\nteaching hospitals to '... slog it to death in\nthe commercial market place.' Mr Martin\nalso predicted that reductions in staffing\nlevels of the type forecast at St mary's would result in not just reduced patient\ncare in the short-term but would have a it\nknock-on effect on training. Hospitals\nsuch as St Mary's would not have the\nresources to train the medical staff of the\nfuture.\nAttempts to contact the Department of\nHealth to answer these serious\naccusations were thwarted yesterday; noone was answering the phone.\n2\n\n"

This competition is open\nto all universities, but only Oxford were\nbrave enough to challenge us. As it\nturned out, they wasted their time again.\nJames Hurr started well with a storming\n42/50 at 100 yards and achieved a total\nscore of 105/150, equalling the college\nrecord. Simon Taylor and Tony Menzies\nshot on the following day and were\nhampered by strong winds and low\ncloud.So their scores of 92/150 and\n73/150 respectively, were very good\nconsidering the bull at 300 yards is only\n12\" in diameter.\nCloud cover became progressively thicker\non Oxford's side of the firing line. This\ncould be the reason for their captain\nbeing unable to find the firing point\nwithin the allotted time.\nThe gravitational attraction of their coach\nis also believed to have adversely\naffected the trajectories of their bullets,\nalthough this would still fail to explain\nthe random placing of their shots.\nIn fairness to Oxford, IC does have the\nadvantage of a better firing range and\nworking facilities for pre-match\npreparation. Unfortunately, the future of\nthe facilities of the club are under serious\nthreat of closure from the 'powers that\nbe' in Sherfield. For future details contact\nJames Hurr, Mech Eng III.\nNBWe would like to point out that the\narticle in 'City Limit' entitled 'Women\nWith Guns' was largely factually incorrect\non several of the major points and\ndeliberately misleading.\nBCCF\nThis year the British Students Federation\nheld the Orienteering UAU finals at\nSheffield. The particularly hilly region\nsurrounding Sheffield, together with the\nseas ional Easter weather (driving rain)\nmade the event even more arousing than\nlast years, held in the New Forest with its\nflat open countryside and warm tropical\nweather.However this did not hold ICOC\nback, as both old (some quite old indeed)\nand new members got some very good\ntimes and positions.\nOur best position was second in the Men'sC course, achieved by Shaun Dore from a field of 17, with a very good time of\n54.44 minutes thus ending an excellent\nfirst season with the club. We were most\nconsistent in the Men'sB, with 6th,10 th and 13th positions for Andy Fazakerly,\nIan Richardson and Jeremy Tongue out of\na total of 57 runners. Tone Nystrom, in\nthe Woman's A did remarkably well\ngetting a time of 86 minutes giving her\n33rd position from a field of 56.And\nfinally Rob Haddock came 46th out of\n110 in the Men's A race.\nEveryone who went had a wonderful\ntime, even better when they had more\nbeer. With the tour to Switzerland in 6\nweeks, a few first places have to be\npossible, if only in the string course !!!\nScience\nFiction\nThe Science Fiction Club Chairman,\nSteven Newhouse, would like to tell all\nthe member of the club, that 'All the\nlibrary books are NOW overdue. They\nshould be returned to the library any\nlunchtime between 12.30-1.30pm before\nthe 3rd June, 1991.

The point of these films tends\nto be 'grab the audience by the balls and\ndon't let go'. Jonathan Demme's film\ngrabs your balls.\nStarring the excellent Jodie Foster as\nClarice Starling, the 'bird' trying to escape\nthe clutches of Hannibal Lecter, an ice-cool role played superbly by Anthony\nThe Wind Willows\n1\"At infant school there were them\nand us. They read Winnie the Pooh;\nwe read The Wind in the Willows.\nWe won,\" says Brian Redhead (whoever\nhe is). We can only grant you that he's telling the truth. The National Theatre is\nstaging Alan Bennett's adaption of that'\nold childhood classic The Wind in the\nWillows, and for all Toad and Moley-fans\nout there: This the chance to relive\nchildhood, to go back to that wonderful\nHopkins. 'Hannibal the Cannibal' (so\nnamed because he ate all his victims) is\nserving a life sentence in a modern-day\n'dungeon' where his intellect is subjected\n(among other things) to the torture of\nlistening to evangelists on TV. Hannibal\nhappens to hold the key to the\nwhereabouts of a killer roaming the\nstreets whose hallmark is to skin his\nvictims (nicknamed Buffalo Bill because\nin the\natmosphere of sun sets.plat and ice-cream\n(and for all you Winnie the Pooh-fans;\nthis goes for you too! Don't let defeat get\nyou down-you can always buy your\nWinnie postcards in the interval...(?))\nThey're all there, David Bamber as\nMole, Michael Bryant as Badger, Richard\nBriers as Ratty and Griff Rhys Jones as\nToad, each giving the performance of his\nlife.\nExaggerated? Well, perhaps, but really,\nthis was fun! Forgetting the world behind\nthe Big Woods (\" we avoid talking about\nit ...), the world of exams and other\nworries, the audience was captured by\nthe magic (no kidding!) of the lighting,\nthe costumes, the sounds, and last but not\nleast: the scenery, every change of which\nbrought on a round of spontaneous\napplause. Special credit to jane Gibson for\ndirecting Movements - the animal\ncharacters are worked out brilliantly, and\nyou are entertained just by the way they\nmove around the stage.\nHow can we describe it?

Bring your gran - and\ndon't forget the ice-cream interval!\nRumpelsgilze and Siao\nhe 'likes to skin his humps'!!). Detective\nStarling is sent to probe the mind of Dr\nHannibal Lecter, in order to track down\nhis ex-patient, Buffalo Bill.\nIn the film Jonathan Demme very\ncleverly plays on our fears of (and\nvoyeuristic urges for) mutilated bodies\n(which usually remain off-screen), insects,\nnasty looking psychos, etc. One of the\nmost effective aspects of the film is the\nstrong presence of the character Hannibal\nLecter in all his scenes. Despite being\nbehind bars, the viewer never doubts the\npower he commands, the danger he\nposes to Starling. And this I think is the\ndriving force behind the film; Demme is\nable to create great tension with the help\nof Anthony Hopkins' performance, but\nnever quite satisfies, leaving the audience\nsalivating for the climax.\nHowever, the film does fail when it\nstarts to wander into the realm of\npsychobabble, trying to come to terms\nwith Hannibal's psyche. The filmmakers\nseem to have some pretensions to this\neffect, but produce nothing coherent.\nIf you do go to see this film, however,\nthere won't be many others in town\noffering as many thrills per second.\nI.H. In Bed With\nMadonna\nI Madonna has FUCK ME written all\nover her forehead. She is witty,\ncrude, sexual and a bitch.\nFilmed during her 'Blonde Ambition'\ntour of 1990, the documentry tries to\nshow Madonna as you have never seen\nher before; human.\nThe filming is excellent, the stage\nscenes shot in glorious technicolor, back\nstage taken in 16mm black and white. It\nshows everything that goes on back stage\non a world tour without making it look\nlike an extended pop video. As a good\ndocumentry always should, it leaves you\nwondering whether or not it was all one\nbig set up.\nThe hype regarding how sexual she\nwas all the way through the film was\nsomewhat exaggerated, after all she only\ntouched her crotch a few time on stage-most of the time her dancers did it for\nher.\nHer parents thought a few acts were a little over the top and so would yours.\nNot the kind of film you'd take your\nmother to see but all in all good fun.\nSam\n5\n\n"

I'd have to say that\nany such comparisons aren't really fair\nbecause the two films are very different;\nMisery is a psychological thriller and\nGraveyard Shift is more of a straight\ncreature feature.\nThis film is basically about a Gaussian\nprobability distribution. What it goes like\nis this : There's a mill (cutely named the\nBachman Mill, for those of you up on\nyour King) which uses good ol' bone-crushing nineteenth century machinery to\nspin yarn. Said mill has a bit of a rat\ninfestation problem. Which is where the\nbell curve comes in. See, there's a few\nsmall rats, down at the low probability\nend (rats aren't so generous to the\nsmaller members of their population);\nthere's a LOT of mid dl ish kind of rats at\nthe bit where the curve swells upwards,\nthen the curve tails off again, where the\nreally big rats are ..\nThe owner of the mill is an unpleasant\ngentleman with a kind of twisted Elmer\nFudd accent who gets his employees\nworking from eleven p.m. through to the\nmorning (the 'graveyard shift' of the title).\nUnfortunately, one by one, they start to\ndisappear which necessitates a bit of\nhasty cover-up, but not to worry, a taciturn stranger who's a mean shot with\na cat a paul t has just arrived.\nYou can pretty much guess the rest,\nfrom the secretary who Finds Out Too\nMuch to the part the mill machinery\nplays in the film's climax. The script (a first-time effort that doesn't say a great\ndeal for the writer's future) is derived\nMisery\nMisery is a fairly faithful adaptation\nof Stephen King's book of the same\nname. The story is pretty simple; an\nauthor, Paul Sheldon (James Caan), is\nrescued from his crashed car by his\n'number one fan', Annie Wilkes (Kathy\nBates, who won the 'Best Actress' Oscar\nfor this performance). She traps him in\nher remote house and tends him halfway\nback to health, at which point she takes a high dive off a low plank and introduces\nhim to her pet pig.\nThings only get worse for Paul after\nthis point, but to say too much would be\nto spoil the film.

    "content": "\\\nRent a A scenic view of Southside and Linstead Halls\nthrough a large bunch of daffodils\nDissatisfaction over the levels of next\nyear's rent levels for the college halls of\nresidence has reached unprecedented\nlevels. The sabbaticals of Imperial college\nUnion, Paul Shanley, Ben Turner and\nMurray Williamson have arranged a number of meetings to discuss the\nsituation.\nSo far meetings have been held in\nLinstead, Beit, Southwell, Willis Jackson,\nHolbein House and Bernard Sunley\nHouse. They were all reported to have\nbeen well attended and residents were\nurged to contact their academic or\npersonal tutors, or the Rector Sir Eric\nAsh, in order to register their\nunhappiness about rent levels next year.\nIn Linstead the meeting dwelled on the\nincrease in the number of weeks for\nwhich rent must be paid. Next year\nresidents must pay 34 weeks rent\nregardless of how long they actually\nintend to stay, in comparison with the\npresent 31 weeks. It is also compulsory to\npurchase a minimum of three evening\nmeals a week in Linstead, so next year's rent would approximately be \u00a360 for the\nmajority of residents.\nIn Holbein House and Southwell Hall\nsome residents complained about the\nquality of accommodation for which they\nhad to pay \u00a340 per week. During the\nmeetings the possibility of a rent strike\nwas mentioned. IC Union President Paul\nShanley was reported as saying that he\nwould no longer wish to be a first year at\nthis college and that you could 'stuff the\nacademic reputation'.\nMembers of the academic staff are\nbelieved to be anxious about the current\naccommodation problems, and they may\ntake the unprecedented step of raising\nthe issue at the Academic Heads of\nDepartment meeting next week. Union\nofficers will visit the other halls of\nresidence - Southside halls, Garden,\nWeeks and Fisher halls over the coming\nweek.\nThe Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths\nhas donated \u00a3250,000 to Imperial College\nin order to provide new accommodation\nfor up to eight students. The house will\nbe within 'reasonable travelling distance\nOf South Kensington' and will contain\neight single study bedrooms.\nThe students selected to live in this\nhouse will receive a Goldsmiths'\nscholarship to lower their rent level. They\nwill be considered to be amongst the\ncollege's 'more outstanding students'. The\nawards will be given mainly to second\nand third year undergraduates and\npossibly a postgraduate on the basis of\nacademic merit.\nIt is unlikely that the awards will be for\nany one particular subject, and the\nselection of the recipient students has not\nyet been made. Dr Jill Pellew, IC's director of development, told Felix that\nthe Goldsmiths will 'substantially help\ntowards the cost of rent for the\naccommodation' according, though the\nprecise value of the scholarships have not\nyet been finalised.\nFurther attempts at alleviating the ever\ngrowing ac como dati on problem are being\nmade by the college finance office. One\noption under consideration is for the\ncollege to establish a company under the\nBusiness Expansion Scheme (BES). The\nBES is a government initiated scheme\nwhereby private investors are encouraged\nto invest up to \u00a340,000 with a five year\ntax-free period on the investment.\nThe money raised by the new company\ncould be used to buy ac como dati on from\nthe college, or to buy new ac como dati on for students. The company dividend\nwould be derived from rent paid by\nstudents. Investors in the company are\nexpected to be staff and friends of IC, not\nprofessional businessmen.\nThe scheme has been adopted by\nCambridge University under the aegis of\nthe Cambridge Colleges Fund raising\n\u00a360,000,000 to date. Although the scheme\nat Imperial is only in the consultative\nstages it is seen by many as an ideal way\nof securing ac como dati on for students in\nthe coming years.\nExample rents for single rooms for\nthe next academic year with the\nobligatory number of weeks:\nBeit, Old Hostel \u00a340 51\nBeit, New Hostel \u00a343 51\nSouthside PG \u00a352 51\nSouthside UG \u00a352 34/38\nGarden \u00a341 51\nLinstead \u00a352 34\nWeeks \u00a352 34\nBernard Sunley \u00a340 38\nRobert Pryor \u00a343 38\nHolbein \u00a340 34\nFisher \u00a352 51\nSouthwell \u00a340 34\nWillis Jackson \u00a340 34\nOlave \u00a352 38/51\nClayponds \u00a348 38/51\n3\n\n"

    "content": "Fatima\nMansions\n-ULU 16.5.91\nHands up, all those familiar, who thought\nCathal Coughlan was a maniac. Really?\nThat many? Oh well, I suppose there was\nenough evidence; He swings and struts in\nchurches, shrieks commands of 'Get these\ndead bodies off my racetrack', and spews\nforth other examples of downright\nobscure fruitcake ry in the lyrics\ndepartment. Yup. Mad as a bean pole. So, after a charming but nevertheless\nbland set by The Popinjays, it's a small\nsurprise to find a true devil of rock 'n' roll inhabiting the stage, Elvis, Iggy,\nLucifer and Jesus: they're all there,\nembodied within the, ahem, 'demonic'\npersona of Cathal Coughlan. 'Valley of\nthe dead cars', 'only losers take the bus'\net al, bitch and steam like the driving\npop tunes they are; Big Madness sees him\nanguished and forlorn, a disappointed\nGod saddened by the behaviour of the\nlittle monkey creatures (no solution?) and,\nlike a good showman, saves all his best\n'as s kicks' for last. So snarls 'Viva dead\nponies'.\nIt's hard to see them existing within the\ndemocracy of 'the band' ethos, really. A water-tight, excellent medium though\nthey are, they are never anything more\nthan that. Now that's fine if they're\ncontent to be simply Cathal Coughlan's band, but it gives me sod all to say about\nthem. So, no complaints for this mere\nmention in passing, eh!\nHmmm. Cathal. What does he do for an\nencore? Well, children, the new single\nYou're a Rose is given an airing, and\nfinally, the 'never-to-be-left-out-of-the-set'\nBlues for Ceausescu. This is rock at its\nfinest, rock to make even Iggy call it a day. The Fatima Mansions, coming soon\nto a church near you. And remember,\nchildren, keep music evil. Please.\nSonic Euph.\nEskimos & Eygpt\n-G' n'R That's What U Want? 12\"\nNice try here lads. Using the guitar loop\nfrom Sweet Child of Mine the Eskimos\nspokesman raps, sounding like the guy\nfrom Jesus Jones, about homophobia,\nsexism etc to a well-worn beat and it\nends up sounding like bad Pop Will Eat\nItself and is actually a total waste of my\ntime, your time and their time. Nice idea,\nafter all G'n' R's social politics leave a lot\nto be desired, but stick to the day jobs for\nthe time being. Sounds nothing like the\nMC5.\nDominic.\n8\nBeat Happening\n-Dreaming LP\nAn amateur looking and sounding\nthreesome using the same, moderately\nsuccessful format throughout; jan gly tuneful guitar and nice thumping drums\nare a backdrop for pleasingly atonal\nvocals which trundle endlessly about sex\nand possibly other unrelated subjects.\nThe male voice has a wonderful (out of\ntune) booming bass growl. This record\nhas very little production and if you play\nit loud enough through big speakers its\nattitude alone will put you in a stoopid\nmood.\nSeb\nThe Rockingbirds Rolling Revue\n-Borderline 21.5.91\nHowdy brothers and sisters and today I just gotta tell you that the country rock\nrevival has already started and you've all\nmissed the wagon. However you need\nnot worry, as pretty soon it'll be coming\nto you and it's achoo gl in' that way BIG\nTIME. This is only the second time I 've\nseen them but I can tell you, hey! pay\nattention, that they are the sure finest,\nsmoulder in' band treading the boards at\nthis moment. Their music, whilst paying\nhomage\u2014as we all do\u2014to Gram Parsons,\nthe Burritos, Johnathan Richman and the\nMC5 has instilled in it the true spirit of\nfreedom, the soaring heights of a buzzard\nfloating on the thermals high above the\ndesert, the heights we only ever achieve\non a few special times in our life. These\nare the heights this band, and tonight\ntheir guest singers but more of that later,\nachieve so calmly, so casually. When\nsong after song, hell I don't know the\nsong names and frankly I don't care\nwhen a band is this good words are\nuseless anyway, sends a shiver down our\nspine you don't care for names.\nCountry rock is both at once so\ncontemporary and so retro that though\nthese boys may get blasted for being\nretro, whoever does the blasting is\nmissing the whole point. They're keeping\nthe spirit alive and with this kind of\nmusic it is the spirit it is played in that is\nall important. Now don't get me wrong,\nthese boys are not rednecks or the like,\nin fact three of them come from Norwich\nand both the bassist and the Charlie\nWatts lookalike drummer used to be in\nThe Weather Prophets, but somehow the\ntrue essence that is Nashville-meets-the\nByrds-meets-Emmy Lou Harris-meets, oh!\nwhat the heck I'm missing the point now\nbut let it suffice to say the spirit is willing\nand the spirit is living and it's in these\nboys. They play 'Johnathan' and it's even\nbetter then when they supported the man\nhimself a few weeks back 'Hanging out\nwith Gram' they sing. It's just a shame\nJojo himself isn't here to witness it. The\nyee-hah s after every song are testament\nto the band's devoted following and\nthw ne one of their guests, who was\nwearing a blue shirt with white speckles\nall over and looked like a cross between\nDavid Sylvian and Tim Burgess, comes on\nand they cover the velvets' I'm Set Free,\nwell at first I faint and wake up in\nNirvana. It's s ooo ooo ooo good. The best\ncover of a Ve've f Undergound song ever.\nIt's just like the velvets gone country with\nJohn Cale on fiddle and not viola. Later I discover that the singer is Joss Cope,\nJulian's brother. Cooooolness in ext rem is. They have lots of foxy babes who come\non and sing all sorts of e lol que nt interpretations of old standards whose\nnames I either never knew or I 've\nforgotten. The knee length boots, the\nlong locks, the span gly waistcoats and the\nubiquitous bottle of beer in hand are not\nde rig eur but they make everything flow\njust that little bit more. Another guest of\ntheirs looking like a cross between Dr\nScrote and Jools Holland is so far gone\nhe can't even remember the 'la-la-la-la-la-la's' when they do Norwegina Wood. The\nspirit of the open plains, the hard tales\nwhich lead men to the bottle and the\nforlorn love songs which melt your heart\nupon first hearing rolls on and there's no\nstop pin' 'em yet. Andy the guitarist still\nlooks like he's either my mate Paddy or\nhe's in Free circa (don't you just love that\nword circa?? Goddamn it it's so middle-aged.) 1973 with his blond locks all kinda\ncurled 'n' crimped. This is why there is\nstill hope for music yet. This is why you\ncan take all y or u Chapterhouses and\nSlowdives and all those others and shove\nem right up your narrow-minded self-centred oppressive ass. You can burn all\nmy records, tear out all my hair and\nthrow darts at my eyes, but this band are\nthe business. This band have reformed\nnot only my love of music, but also the\njoy of living, the joy of breathing, the joy\nof having a good time which has been so\nlacking in all those dour, introspective,\nlet's stare-at-our-feet school of music\nbands. Well you'd all better watch out,\n'cos The Rockinbirds are comin' for your\ndaughters. After the show the tambourine\nplayer tells me they've just signed a deal\nwith Heavenly. Everything fits,\neverything is perfect, I am alive, so is the\nworld, so just keep on achoo gl in'. Dominic\n\n"
