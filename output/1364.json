    "content": "Lara Croft, Countess of Abingdon,\nis a bit of a grey area when it comes\nto character branding. Now Mario,\nMario is one of those universal\ncharacters. Everyone loves Mario,\nlike that bumbling uncle or strange\nlecturer that, whilst you don\u2019t always understand them, are never\nanything less than adorable.\nThe problem with Lara is that\nshe\u2019s changed so much over the\nlast decade that, at some point\nin the past, the chances are you\ncouldn\u2019t stand her. But, by the same\ntoken, there\u2019s something in the\nTomb Raider franchise that keeps\nLara floating at the top of the Pop\nCulture sea, and has done since her\ninception way back in 1996.\nAnd yes, okay, it\u2019s the titties.\nTen years, two movies, and seven\ngames, though, is no mean feat for\na woman that, despite not existing (sorry, chaps), has had quite a\nfraught history.\nLara - or Laura, until marketing informed them that Americans\nYou\u2019ve come a long, long way, darling\nMovies, manors, and mammaries - Tony Plana looks back on ten years of Lara\nTalking \u2018bout my (next) generation...\nWhere do consoles go to die? James Willock grieves for the casualties of war\nOut now\n\u201cMorning, Mr. Freeman. Looks like you\u2019re running late?\u201d\non; to the point of firing the fourth\nmodel to play Lara after she posed\nnude in a Playboy shoot, as well as\nshutting down the notorious NudeRaider.com website; her original\ncreator, Toby Gard, left Core Design shortly after the release of the\nfirst game, unhappy with the way\nLara was being portrayed.\n\u201cShe confounds all the sexist clich\u00e9s\u201d he told The Face shortly after\nthe games release, but admitted\nthat marketing realised the most\nobvious way to promote the game.\nAfter reaching a high point with\nThe Last Revelation, the series\nwent into a decline, and even an\nattempt to rejuvenate the game\non the Playstation 2 fell somewhat\nshort. The latest release however -Tomb Raider: Legend - sees the return of Toby Gard to the franchise,\neven if only in an advisory role.\nAnd the critical response did im-prove. Mario, Sonic, Crash Bandicoot - they have a particular image,\npartly helped by being open to children - that can\u2019t be shattered by the\nquality of the games they feature in.\nBut the challenge of keeping a more\nadult brand alive is that adults are\ngenerally much more easily turned\noff.\nLara\u2019s tenth birthday is a remarkable milestone for a woman who\nsimultaneously represents gaming\u2019s most mature and immature\nmoments from the last few generations of console. Whether she outlasts a feisty plumber with a pipe\nfetish remains to be seen. Happy\nbirthday, mi\u2019lady.\nwould mispronounce it - fell into a\ngaming industry populated with\nDuke Nukem, the Quake marine\nand butch Raccoon City cops. The\nguns were still there, and so were\nthe goons. But the player was suddenly in less familiar territory. For\none thing, they had really tight\nshorts on.\nWas it pandering to the lady-de-prived gamer stereotype? Lara\u2019s\nsexuality has gone through various stages of exploitation over the\nyears. Although Eidos frequently\nfought to keep Lara\u2019s clothes firmly\nPixellated to picture-perfect - Lara Croft\u2019s change from Tomb Raider on the Playstation through to the present-day Legend on next-gen\nDoes a games console ever really \u201cdie\u201d? Traditionally speaking,\nprevious generation consoles have\na remarkably positive history for\nstaying alive when succeeded by\ntheir newer brothers and sisters.\nIndeed, one can walk into most\nhigh-street video game outlets and\nstill purchase original Playstation\ntitles and consoles - the pre-owned\nmarket allows extended life to the\nobsolete hardware in some senses,\nbut when does a console fade into\nhistory and become a relic? When\nthe manufacturer stops producing\nunits? When the developers stop\nmaking games?\nThe consumer and producer\u2019s\nview of when a console is dead differ vastly. To Sony, for example, it\nseems clear cut. When they stop\nreceiving license fees from game\npublishers and their big Playstation\nfactories cease emitting smoke,\nthat console is gone. To some con-sumers, it\u2019s only just begun. Late\nadopters can pick up pre-owned\nor discontinued stock for pocket\nchange, and start out on the adventures many took up years ago, at a\nfraction of the cost. This is, how-ever, a repeat process. Eventually\nthese people will be in possession\nof even newer consoles, which play\nthe older games, and then - surely\n- those older consoles must be ob-solete, useless? Perhaps not in the\ncase of the Microsoft Xbox. The\nXbox\u2019s genius is in its simplicity:\nit\u2019s a PC. In a box. As such, very\nclever EULA-breaking people have\nfigured out ways to make it do other\nthings beside play games. At home,\nI can stream media over my network directly onto the Xbox and\nthen onto my very cheap telly. My\nfriend can access his over the Internet at work. Some people even use\nthem as web servers. Why not?\nThe same cannot be said for the\nPlaystation 2, which is - at best - a\nvery expensive DVD player. When\nthe world\u2019s richest buy their new\nSony toy on launch day, they\u2019re not\ngoing to keep their number twos\non standby - not when the newer\nconsoles are backwards-compat-ible. The same is not true for the\nXbox - when, or if, I buy one of Microsoft\u2019s newer consoles, the Xbox\nwon\u2019t end up in the attic or on eBay.\nIt\u2019ll be hooked up to an older TV in\nanother room in the house. As far\nas I\u2019m concerned, it fills the roll of\na piece of hardware several times\nits cost. It won\u2019t die until it does\nliterally. And then I\u2019ll probably buy\nanother, at a fraction of a fraction of\nthe original cost.\nIncreasingly, we\u2019re seeing the\nrecycling of older hardware for\nnewer purposes. Old PCs in the\nboots of cars hooked up to tiny TFT\nscreens. Hand-held consoles being\nused as controllers and peripherals for their bigger brothers (a la\nGamecube & Gameboy Advance).\nConsoles reaching outside their\nremit of playing video games will\nbe an important factor in future endeavours in the market.\nIndeed, a sizeable slice of the\nXbox pie is made up of people who\nwish to do more advanced operations - why buy a consoles and a\nmedia centre?\nWith the increased interest in\nmultiple-use machines, in order to\nretain customers and effectively\nfight Microsoft\u2019s offering, Sony and\nto some extent, Nintendo, must up\ntheir games - and do more than just\nput faster graphics processors in\nbigger, blacker consoles.\nKilling is one of those things that\nnever gets old, and this week there\nare a few new methods of killing\nthat are worth looking into. The\nfirst - Gears Of War - is a co-op-erative killing spree dressed up in\nthe shiny Unreal 3 engine. The AI\nis an improvement on the last gen-eration, but you\u2019ll find the entire\nexperience a lot more fun if you\u2019ve\ngot some humans playing with you -either through the LIVE online sys-tem, or within punching distance in\nthe room.\nBut guns are boring unless you\u2019re\nwearing a cape, so Final Fantasy\nfans will be pleased (unless you\u2019re a\npurist) to know that Vincent Valentine is returning this week in Dirge\nOf Cerberus; an enjoyable - if confusing - romp exploring Vince\u2019s past\nas a moody bastard with problematic social skills.\nIf you want something more\nhands-on, then IL-2 Sturmovik,\nthe World War 2 flight simulator,\nfinally makes a return to the PC.\nReality whores will be pleased to\nknow that the aircraft repertoire\nhas expanded even further since\nlast time, and the rest of you will be\npleased to know that, yes, there are\nmore things to blow up this time.\nSkateboarding, whilst not having the universal appeal of killing\nthings, still seems to be keeping\npopular. Tony Hawk\u2019s Downhill\nJam last week is followed up by the\nrelease of Project 8 on the other\nconsoles - a return to more traditional roots for the series, with\nsome improved physics that unfortunately do little more than help\nyou wince more when you bail (and\nyou will, frequently). If you loved\nTony Hawk\u2019s in the past, though,\nand were turned off by American\nWasteland or Underground, then\nit might be time to return to the\nseries.\nAnd finally, if you\u2019re feeling bored\nwith Neverwinter Nights 2 already\nand want a decent single-player\nromp, Dungeon Siege 2 is now in\nbudget, and can be snapped up for\njust \u00a317.99. Alternatively, pick up\nevery Baldur\u2019s Gate game ever\nreleased on the PC, as well as the\noriginal Neverwinter Nights col-lection, in a new compilation pack,\nfor just \u00a324.99.\nGears of War: Killin\u2019 stuff proper\nTH - Project 8: Illin\u2019 stuff proper\n\u2013 Barney, Half-Life\n23\nfelix\nFriday 17 November 2006\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWith little possibility for modding, and the Wii (above) replacing the\nneed for a console to play old games, is the Gamecube doomed to fail\n\n"

    "content": "B\nrowsing the website of the Imperial\nIslamic Society the\notherday,Ihappened\nupon an article entitled \u201cThe Light of\nIslam in Constantinople\u201d. Penned by Ibn Munir, the\narticle starts out by telling us that\n\u201cthe city of Constantinople (com-monly known today as Istanbul)\nwas enlightened and blessed with\nIslam on 855 Hijri (1453 AD)\u201d. The\ndesire on the part of the Ottoman\nTurks to conquer what had been\nChristendom\u2019s leading city for over\na thousand years was, we are told,\nfounded on a saying of Muhammad,\nin which he proclaimed that \u201cConstantinople will be conquered at the\nhands of a man, so blessed be the\nleader of that conquest and blessed\nbe that army!\u201d\nAccording to Mr Munir, Muhammad decided that Constantinople, a\ncity nearly 1,500 miles from Mecca,\nwas to be conquered by Muslim\nforce of arms. Despite the passage\nof over 800 years, the force of this\nexhortation inspired the Ottoman\nTurks, a people originally from\nTurkestan in Central Asia whose\nancestors were themselves conquered by the Arabs, to bring the\n\u201clight of Islam\u201d to Constantinople.\nThis was a great \u201cblessing\u201d for the\ncity, we are told. What, one wonders,\ndid this \u201cblessing\u201d consist of?\nMr Munir\u2019s article is rather\nsketchy on the details, so we must\nlook elsewhere for them. Steven\nRunciman, in his book The Fall of\nConstantinople, describes how,\non breaching the walls, Muslim\nsoldiers \u201cslew everyone that they\nmet in the streets, men, women,\nand children without discrimina-tion. The blood ran in rivers down\nthe steep streets from the heights\nof Petra toward the Golden Horn.\nBut soon the lust for slaughter\nwas assuaged. The soldiers realized that captives [i.e., slaves] and\nprecious objects would bring them\ngreater profit.\u201d For those unfamiliar with the history, this was but the\nclimactic battle after centuries of\nsuch warfare against the Byzantine\nEmpire.\nIt is not my intention here to\nclaim that the Turkish conquest of\nConstantinople was any more brutal than similar horrors carried out\nby other medieval armies, includ-ing, of course, European armies.\nBut it is essential to point out, however obvious it may seem, that all\nthis medieval brutality was indeed\nmedieval in nature, and it is for precisely this reason that decent people in the 21st century are shocked\nand disgusted by the violence perpetrated by their ancestors.\nNo Englishman today celebrates\nthe horrendous violence inflicted\non the Scottish, Irish or Welsh populations of the British Isles, and no\nsane American looks back on the\n1864 Sand Creek Massacre with a\nsense of fond nostalgia. In contrast,\nthe Islamic Society is happy to post\narticles which celebrate the unprovoked Muslim conquests of non-Muslims, conquests which were\ninspired by the founder of their\nreligion, and which were accompanied by the slaughter, rape, pillage\nand enslavement of the defeated\npeoples.\nAs the debates about Islam\u2019s role\nin world conflict continue to rage\naround us, we have been assured\nrepeatedly that Osama bin Laden\nand his ilk constitute nothing more\nthan Islam\u2019s lunatic fringe. In this\ninterpretation, far from being the\npsychotic death-cult that it impersonates so well, Islam is in fact a\nreligion of peace and tolerance. Yet\nthe Islamic Society openly gloats\nover the brutality of its coreligion-ists, brutality many orders of magnitude greater than that of the 9/11\nattacks, and, just as importantly,\nbrutality which has no conceivable\njustification in terms of self-de-fence, American forces stationed\nin Saudi Arabia, unusual celestial\nactivity, or anything else.\nLet us conduct a brief thought ex-periment, in which a group of Imperial students establishes a British\nEmpire Society. On its Union-provided website, it puts up an article\ncelebrating the way in which the\nBritish Empire offered millions of\nAfricans, at no charge, the opportunity to start a new life in the Americas, working on a tobacco or sugar\nplantation. This and other endeavours on the part of said empire, the\narticle claims, are what brought\nthe light of civilization to Africans.\nSuch a development would clearly\nbe inconceivable, and utterly farcical were it in fact to occur. Yet the\nIslamic equivalent sits happily on\nthe website of the Islamic Society, whose members presumably\nconsider it to be objective history\nrather than the deluded and self-congratulatory propaganda it so\nmanifestly is.\nThe lazy imprecision of the distinction so regularly drawn between\n\u2018moderate\u2019 and \u2018extremist\u2019 Muslims\nhas always bothered me, but, given\nhow widespread it has become, let\nus adopt it here. I assume that the\nmembers of the Islamic Society will\nnot self-identify as extremists. If,\nhowever, they consider themselves\n\u2018moderates\u2019, is it unreasonable\nto ask what the material on their\nwebsite tells us about \u2018moderate\u2019\nIslam? I admit that it is unsettling\nto ask these questions. But it is suicidal not to ask them.\nSamuel Lynas asks some unsettling questions about the articles on Imperial Islamic Society\u2019s website\nIslam, violence, and the empires\n\u201cThe Islamic\nSociety is happy\nto post articles\nwhich celebrate\nthe unprovoked\nMuslim\nconquests of\nnon-Muslims\u2026\ninspired by the\nfounder of their\nreligion and\u2026\naccompanied by\nthe slaughter,\nrape, pillage,\nand enslavement\nof the defeated\npeoples\u201d\nThe fresco The Siege of Constantinople in the church of the Annunciation at Moldovita depicts Christians routing the infidel with arrows and cannons and miraculous icons\n10 felix Friday 17 November 2006\nomment&\nOpinion\nC\n\n"

Felix\nwas also named \u2018Student Newspaper of the Year\u2019.\nThe paper argued that the decision taken not to award life membership last year had been \u201cpetty,\nvindictive, and reflected poorly on\nICU Council,\u201d and that \u201cthis decision sets an alarming precedent\nas it compromises Felix\u2019s editorial\nindependence if awards are seen\nto be linked to how \u2018nice\u2019 you are to\nThe much-maligned ex-Felix Editor, Rupert Neate, has been granted life membership of\nthe Union after winning Journalist of the Year at the Guardian Student Media Awards\nMr. Arif, when contacted by Live!,\nsaid that he did no such thing, and\nthat Mr. Matthews\u2019 interpretation is\n\u201cvery creative\u201d.\nThe precedent that Mr. Matthews\nis referring to is likely to be the impounding of Felix during the sabb\nelections three years ago. In that\ncase, one candidate had placed an\nadvert in the paper, and the other\ncandidates complained. The sabbs\nthen impounded the paper, going as\nfar as to tear it from people\u2019s hands.\nAfter a confrontation with a rather\nangry Alex Coby, Felix Editor at\nthe time, who declared the action\n\u201cabsolutely outrageous, completely\nout of order and quite possibly illegal,\u201d the newspaper was swiftly\nre-released. When questioned by\nthis reporter, Mr. Matthews stated\nthat he was well aware of this prec-edent, but that this was an entirely\nseparate situation.\nHe confirmed that he had been\napproached by the \u2018Yes\u2019 campaign\nwith concerns over conspiracy in\nthe ranks of the \u2018No\u2019 campaign;\nGuildsheet is the CGCU newspaper,\nand the leader of the \u2018No\u2019 campaign\nis the CGCU President, James Fok.\nAdditionally, the publication shares\nan office with Mr. Fok. Mr. Matthews\nalso commented on the fact that\nGuildsheet had no set publication\ndate, and that he\u2019d heard the paper\nwas \u201crushed to completion\u201d.\nAshley Brown, editor of Live!,\nrefuted these accusations: \u201cGuildsheet comes out monthly, and has\ndone for years. The papers were\nsupposed to be delivered on Saturday [a month since the last issue],\nbut a technical failure at the printers meant they were delivered on\nTuesday.\u201d He also stated that there\nis very little contact between Mr.\nFok and the editor of Guildsheet,\nas \u201call of the editing on Guildsheet\nis done within the editor\u2019s Beit Hall\nroom,\u201d and that he rarely if ever enters the CGCU office.\nMr. Matthews has said that\nGuildsheet will be released on Friday, once the referendum result\nis announced. Whether that will\nbe enough to save this somewhat\nfarcical referendum remains to be\nseen.\nNUS farce\ncontinues\nUnion officers.\u201d\nAs could be expected with any\nCouncil debate involving Mr. Neate,\nthe debate became rather furious.\nMany present had been treated\nbadly by Mr. Neate or Felix at some\npoint, and were loathe to let this paper pass.\nVarious amendments to the paper were proposed, mainly striking\nthe sections that criticised Council. John Collins, Union President,\nsaid: \u201cWe have to think carefully\nbefore making this Union policy if\nit contains this kind of criticism.\u201d\nHe proposed striking all the points\nthat criticised Council, as \u201cthe end\nresult would be the same anyway.\u201d\nMr. Brown put up a passionate fight\nto try to save the measures, but\nCouncil voted to strike them.\nIn the end, after almost half an\nhour of debate, Council finally\nmoved to a vote and passed the paper with a sizeable majority, to the\nobvious disdain of some of those\npresent.

I\u2019m\nsick of yellow shirts, I\u2019m sick of the external\ncampaigners and their enforced cheerfulness,\nand I\u2019m sick of crusading No campaigners. In\nshort, fuck the referendum. Before I shut up\nabout it forever, there\u2019s something I want to\nget off my chest about it.\nUnsurprisingly for an IC democratic event,\nthe whole thing has descended into near farce, if not\nforty-clowns-in-car farce. The ridiculous recall of Guildsheet is merely the final straw in a referendum that\u2019s\nbeen characterised by name-calling, petty complaints,\naccusations of bias and downright lying. Somewhere in\nbetween we forgot we were supposed to be having a referendum to decide the future affiliations of this Union,\nand that maybe, just maybe, we should think carefully\nabout the issues involved, as well as presenting these\nissues in an unobsfucated and honest way. The little\nspat over the NUS affiliation fee cost (which may or\nmay not have reached the student body), and the subsequent carefulness of the President involving the subject,\nwas appalling to see. In no way has the President been\ndishonest, but it is one thing to be honest and entirely\nanother to represent the facts accurately and clearly. I\ndon\u2019t even want to touch the Yes campaign\u2019s \u201cAnti-NUS\nmyths\u201d flyers, as they discuss things like beer prices, Kit\nKats and other silly fallacies that the No campaign know\nwill not be an issue.\nThe above does in no way align me with the No cam-paign, for they have are equally to blame for the farce\nthat the referendum became. They have banged on\nendlessly about the affiliation fee, and the possibility of\nmoney being drawn away from clubs to pay for it, despite\n(reasonably trustworthy) assurances from Beit Towers\nthat this will not be the case.\nThere were a few valid points raised in this farcical\ndisaster. The Yes campaign\u2019s argument that we need a\nvoice is valid and relevant. The NUS wields huge power,\neven though it may be a somewhat damaged organisa-tion. The No campaign are right to focus on the joke\nthat is the National Conference, and the sometimes irrelevant nature of the NUS\u2019s campaigns. These points\nwere lost under a shitstorm of pointless point-scoring\nand needless personal attacks.\nI\u2019m so very disappointed in the whole process. As I\u2019d\nnever had any involvement with the whole Union process\nbefore becoming editor, I\u2019d always assumed that things\nweren\u2019t as bad as the general student population makes\nout. It turns out that, for the most part, they were right\nall along. By now, of course, the referendum is over, and\nwe\u2019re stuck with whatever choice was made for a year. I\nhope you at least thought before you voted, rather than\nletting someone else do the thinking for you.\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB.

According to the Metropolitan Police, however, the burning of\neffigies is an incitement to violence and\nunacceptable in their eyes, even in the\nabstract form of a flag.\nBut to what extent does the catholic\ncommunity suffer reprisals from mobs\nhungry for blood after being stirred into\na rage after the family-friendly ceremony depicting the violent and spontaneous destruction of the nation\u2019s heads of\nstate and government, symbolised by\na few brightly-coloured fireworks and\nThe history of bonfire night\nHugh Mansfield\nthe less obliquely symbolic burning of\nan enemy combatant on pyres across\nthe country? And, come to that, why\nis it that this is still considered acceptable four centuries after the attempted\nact was aborted? It be seen as terribly\nblood-thirsty that we indoctrinate our\nchildren into such behaviour.\nThere is a school of thought which\nclaims that this is not, in itself, an anti-catholic celebration (or, if you prefer,\ncommemoration) and that Fawkes\u2019s cabal of plotters should not be taken to be\nrepresentativeofCatholicism.However,\ngiven that their actions were inspired\nby a bias against their religion by the\nstate which can be seen in retrospect\nto be considerably more perceived than\nreal, they cannot help but be seen as\nambassadors for Catholicism, despite\nsuch extremists being a minority. Consequently, their actions stirred up anti-Catholic sentiment which had, mostly,\nbeen dormant up until that point.\nSo, given that it can be argued that\nburning an effigy of a catholic terrorist\nis not an incitement to violence against\nCatholics, would it be as acceptable to\nburn effigies of perpetrators of more\nrecent atrocities committed due to perceived religious slights? Certainly, the\nMetropolitan Police wouldn\u2019t think so,\nalthoughtheircurrentstanceonFawkes\nis not a matter of public record.\nBut since the stated aim of celebrating the failure of the gunpowder plot is\nto keep it in the public\u2019s eye as an example to all who would do likewise, surely\nother such examples would be worth-while? Though perhaps the fact that\nthere would be a need for such further\nexamples shows that the inherent message has lost some of its potency somewhere in the past four hundred years.\nShould it then, be replaced?\nCertainly, there is nothing comparable in the case of the attacks of the\n11th of September \u2013 a memorial service at ground zero is considerably less\nof an undertaking than bonfire night\nacross even so small a country as our\nown. Much of the memorial comes in\nthe form of glib soundbites, such as\nthe constant use of the term \u201c9/11\u201d to\nrefer to the events \u2013 even \u201cthe gunpowder plot\u201d is a less lazy shorthand than\ntrivialising the date to such an extreme.\nEven when referred to by date, it is in\nthe full form of \u201cthe fifth of November\u201d\nor even in a rhyming mnemonic, rather\nthan \u201c5/11\u201d or somesuch. Apparently\nthe similarity between \u201c9/11\u201d and the\ntelephone number 911 makes this especially catchy, which makes it little better than a pun, which is no way to treat\nsuch a monumental tragedy.\nThe risk of offending religious minorities seems to be holding western\nnations back from properly remembering such atrocities, though it appears\nto come more from fear of retribution\nthan from any moral standpoint.\nDear Andy,\nI\u2019m writing regarding the front page\narticle accusing the ex-President of\ndisregarding the constitution. I was\ndisappointed to see this issue being\nblown out of proportion, especially as\nthe incident happened over 6 months\nago.\nWe all know that sometimes timings\nfor decisions have to be tight because\nof other restrictions (elections timings\nin this case), and as for Sameena saying that she\u2019d make decisions herself\nwithout consulting the committee\n- well its clear that this was just an\nangry outburst once she\u2019d realised that\nthe trust of the committee had been\nbroken, and nothing more \u201cscandalous\u201d than that. As Simon Matthews\n(last year\u2019s DPCS) said, it was all\n\u201cwell-intentioned\u201d.\nI worked with the Sabb team last\nyear when I ran the Hockey Club and\nso I know the hard work Sameena and\nher team of Sabbs, Simon, Tim, etc. put\nin last year for the good of the Union.\nRich Bacon\nDear Andy,\nI sat on executive last year and just\nwanted to present my view of what\nhappened when, as it has been suggested Sameena \u201cdisregarded the\nconsitution\u201d.\nI\u2019m unwilling to go into specifics of\nwhat happened, it was after all closed\nsession, however my view is that it was\nsomething of a last minute problem.\nWith last minute problems like these\nthere is no easy solution. It is never\neasy to convine an emergency exec\nwith little notice, especially since\nat least one member was a medical\nstudent, who (I believe) was not then\nbased in south kensington.\nMy view is that the correct, indeed\nonly posible, action was taken.\nSome time later I was approached\nby a close associate of the current\npresident and asked something along\nthe lines of \u201cwhat\u2019s this I hear about\nthe DPGS elections?\u201d. (S)he was not\na member of the executive. Since this\nwas a closed session meeting I refused\nto comment, and took my concerns to\nSameena.\nA senior and long serving union manager then mentioned, in an attempt to\noffer their advice, that the leaking of\nclosed session items has previously\nhad some very serious concequences\nto the union. I belive this.\nAs a concequence Sameena told exec\nthat she would not be bringing futher\nsimilar closed session items to exec.\nThis is not to say that she would have\nacted upon them on her own. The one\nthing about Sameena was that she was\nvery good at seeking advice and turning to others when problems were oc-curing, or if she didn\u2019t believe that she\nhad the ability to complete something.\nIf you don\u2019t believe this then I suggest you examine who were the returning officers in last years (post council)\nelections.\nOne of the questions I feel obliged\nto ask is why this is coming out now,\nsome six months after the event, with\nthe DPGS settled into position. It is fair\nto say that exec was somewhat divided\nlast year, with two senior members not\nseeing eye to eye.\nFinally I would ask that no body\nshould overlook the high level work\nwhich Sameena did for the union over\nat least two years.\nRegards,\nMark Flower\n11\nfelix\nFriday 17 November 2006\nCOMMENT & OPINION comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDear Felix,\nJust wanted to say well done for winning best paper.

This\nwas in\nmy\nopinion\nthe most\nimpressive piece of the\nexhibition.\nAnother lovely\npiece is that of\nthe \u2018Krishna dancing on Kaliya,\u2019 this playful piece\ndepicts a triumphant Krishna who\nhas tamed the demon Kaliya. This\nstrange creature has a long serpent\ntail but from the waist up resembles a child, Krishna holds the tail\nup proudly and the subdued demon\nsmiles placidly from underneath\nKrishna\u2019s feet. This piece was my\nfavourite representation of Vishnu.\nPart of sacred worship of all\ndeities is acknowledgement and\nappreciation of the highly sexual image of The Divine. The\nChola images rejoice in the\nphysical beauty of the body\nand of nature, and embrace\nsexuality. \u2018Uma as Durga\u2019\nis a highly sensual piece\nwhere the Goddess stands\nproudly half-naked displaying her full voluptuous\nfigure.\nLike other Chola pieces\nthe inspiration came from\nthe raw power and beauty\nof nature.

Indeed\nmultiplicity is very important in the\nHindu religion and deities depicted\nby the Chola bronzes fulfil a multitude of roles from demon slaying\nto child-rearing. In fact their characteristic multiple arms represent\ntheir ability to carry out many different tasks.\nShiva is the key deity to Chola\nChola: Sacred Bronzes of\nSouthern India\nRoyal Academy of Arts\nUntil 25 February 2007\nShiva as Nataraja\nThis comedy can only be described\nas a virtuoso performance by the\ntwo actors Hugh Lee and Simon\nDelaney. They start by playing the\nmain characters, local Irish lads\nJake Quinn and Charlie Conlon and\ngo on to play thirteen other charac-ters, revolving throughout the play.\nThe plot: a major Hollywood studio descends on rural Co. Kerry,\nIreland to make a film. The locals\nare employed as extras get paid a\ngood \u00a340 for a day\u2019s filming.\nThrough the presence of the film\ncompany filming in the village, we\nsee Jake and Charlie\u2019s desires,\nhopes and fears unroll. The tragic\ndeath of one of Jake\u2019s family members Sean, gives the play its name.\nThroughout the play, Charlie has\na dream to write and produce a\nscript, and despite his recent failures eventually transcribes a story\nabout him and Jake, two extras in a\nfilm trying to make it big.\nThe transition from one character\nto the next is seamless: body pos-ture, facial expressions and voice\nare all timed to perfection. Lee and\nDelaney are hilarious as they hold\nthe stage for nearly two hours.\nEspecially funny and well acted is\nthe assistant director Ashley, who\ncan only be described as juvenile,\nextremely pushy and pouting. The\nenergy of the two actors never fal-ters, the greatest moment being\nwhen they perform an Irish dance.\nThe play is somewhat confusing\nat the start, but once you get your\nhead around the character chang-es, it is highly entertaining.

It is not quite what you\u2019d expect\nI\u2019m not an ABBA fan. I\u2019m also not,\nin general, a fan of musicals, except those from before about 1940,\nand even then I don\u2019t like many. So\nit was with some foreboding that I\nagreed to review Mamma Mia! the\n1990s musical constructed around\nthe ABBA back catalogue.\nIfyouloveABBA,youcan\u2019tgowrong\nwith this show. It includes practically every hit (except Fernando,\naccording to a disgruntled woman\nin the rowbehind me), plus some of\ntheir more exciting costumes, and\npiles of their cheesiness.\nWritten by Benny Andersson and\nBj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus (the brains behind\nABBA), the musical follows the story of a Sophie, daughter of Greek\ntaverna owner and ex-club singer\nDonna, as she is about to be mar-ried. Sophie doesn\u2019t know who her\nfather is, and Donna won\u2019t tell her,\nso Sophie steals her diaries and using some basic maths narrows the\nfield down to three.\nWithout telling her mother, Sophie invites the three men to her\nwedding, assuming she will be able\nto recognise her father.\nWe warn patrons of a nervous disposition that platform boots and white lycra feature in this production\nUnfortunately for Sophie, this\ndoesn\u2019t happen, and when all three\nguess what has happened and\nagree to walk her down the aisle,\nSophie is forced to tell her mother\nwhat she did.\nPretty unadventurous stuff, and\nthis production could easily have\nleant on the fact that it sings ABBA\nin order to sell tickets, but it doesn\u2019t.\nDespite the young leads (Sophie\nand her fianc\u00e9 Sky) being practically completely one-dimensional, the\nshow entertains throughout thanks\nto the older cast of Donna\u2019s friends\nand exes.\nParticularly noteworthy were\nTanya (played by the understudy)\nthe gold-digging divorc\u00e9e, and Bill\n(also the understudy), the eccentric\njungle explorer.\nComic highlights came when Bill\nwas serenaded by Rosie (Joanna\nMonro) with Take a Chance on Me,\nand the high-kicks of Sky\u2019s friends\nwhilst wearing flippers. I also enjoyed the production\u2019s penchant for\neye-catching codpieces.\nDespite some very tenuous links\ninto songs and an annoyingly soppy\nending, I really did enjoy this pro-duction. It doesn\u2019t make the mistake of taking itself seriously, and I\nlaughed all the way through.\n\u00a9\nCLEVELAND\nMUSEUM\nOF\nART\nRidiculously stereotypical gay pick-up activity #27: Singing ABBA songs whilst splaying your legs\n\n"

    "content": "The world\u2019s largest drugs scandal\nRadha Gadhok asks is it acceptable that health companies are driven to make a profit from peoples\u2019 sickness?\nCorporate scandal is not hard to\ncome by in the media and the pharmaceutical industry certainly takes\nits fair share of the limelight. In a\nclimate where private corporations need to be seen fulfilling their\nsocial responsibilities and becoming conscientious enterprises the\npharmaceutical industry has made\nmany moves to improve its public\nimage. Yet it is questionable how\nmuch drug companies will actually change as long as they remain\ndriven by profit. How ethical is it for\ncompanies at the very core of public\nhealth to be driven by their share-holders, profiting from sickness?\nFor many years there has been\nmuch talk around the so-called 90-10 gap, by which only ten percent of\nthe global health research budget\nof $50 \u2013 60 billion is spent on the diseases that affect 90 percent of the\nworld\u2019s population. Forty-six times\nmore money is reportedly spent on\ndevelopment of Viagra than on new\ntuberculosis drugs. The Pharmaceutical industry however argues\nthe problem of treating disease\nin the developing world lies in the\nhands of improved drug distribution and health infrastructure and\nseemingly believes that their role\nmay be fulfilled by drug donation.\nYet there is only so much that limited handouts of a small number of\ndrugs can do. What might seriously\nhelp developing countries to overcome disease is access to cheaper\ngeneric versions of patented medi-cines, something that the World\nHealth Organisation\u2019s rules on Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)\nshould support but which is being\nfought heavily by pharmaceutical\ncompanies.\nIn India Novartis continue to seek\nto prevent the sale of generic versions of cancer drug Gilvec, carrying out its threats to withdraw\npreviously offered free treatment\nto patients if the market remained\nopen. Meanwhile Pfizer are suing\nthe Philippine government over the\nimport of drug Norvasc (a treatment for high blood pressure) from\nsurrounding countries including\nThailand and Indonesia where the\ndrug is considerably more afford-able. Pfizer insists that neither will\nit reduce the cost of the drug of the\nPhilippines, nor allow the testing of\ncheaper imports now nor the purchase of imports when the patent\non Norvasc expires.\nThe WHO estimate that 74% of\nAIDS medicines are still under\nmonopoly with forces such as the\nUnited States putting further pressure on the developing world to\nseek stricter intellectual property\nrights.\nClearly despite the buzzwords,\nthe \u201cpublic-private partnerships\u201d\nand \u201ccorporate citizenship\u201d, drug\nmonopolies and thus a monopoly\non health still remain.\nThe notion of profits before health\nis not restricted to the developing\nworld. In 2002 GlaxoSmithKline\nwere at the heart of much debate\nas their widely used antidepressant drug Seroxat (paroxetine)\nwas allegedly misrepresented in\nstudies, disguising its reduced effectiveness and higher suicide risk\nin adolescent patients. It might be\nfair to argue that since drug trial-ling in children is impossible it is inevitable that these scenarios might\noccur. However in the court cases\nthat followed GSK refused to discuss it\u2019s out of court settlements. It\nis easy to understand that no company would willingly give up such\na profitable drug to bad publicity;\nhowever such moves will hardly go\nfar in satisfying the transparency\nand accountability being demanded\nby consumer groups.\nWhen in September 2004 Merck\n& Co withdrew Rofecoxib, an anti-inflammatory drug used in osteoarthritis and pain control due to\nits significant side effects it was\nthe most widely prescribed drug to\never be withdrawn. Discussion and\ndebate continues to surround this\ndrug. These are merely examples\nthat might lead us to question how\nmuch trust healthcare professionals can place in the pharmaceutical\nindustry. One might further question trust in clinical practice. Consumers International claims that\nsome sixty billion dollars are spent\nannually by the pharmaceutical industry on drug promotion, the details of which are rarely made pub-lic. Much of this presumably goes\non the gifts and \u201cperks\u201d bestowed\nupon doctors by drug companies in\nthe promotion of new (often more\ncostly) drug- clearly a questionable practice. A more far reaching\ninfluence could come in the form of\n\u201cDrug-to-Consumer\u201d advertising\npermitted in the US but not currently in the EU. whilst Pharma\ncontinues to push for relaxation of\nthese restrictions in the EU Health\nAction International (a non-profit\norganisation representing consumer interests) continues to state that\nthe pharmaceutical industry is not\nnearly as unbiased, reliable and as\ncomparative as it needs to be.\nOne consumer\u2019s group reports\nthat between 2002 and 2005 there\nwere 972 breaches of the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industry ethical drug practice\nguidelines.35% of these were on\nthe grounds of misleading drug\ninformation.\nThe discussion is clearly complicated and made of many parts.\nIt is not simply a question of \u201ccorporation bashing\u201d. There are real\nand difficult problems with having\na profit driven Pharmaceutical Industry. This article is merely a brief\nintroduction; however on Tuesday\n21st November six experts in this\nfield including Dr Michael Borowitz\nof the UK Department for International Development and Professor\nTrevor Jones CBE, Former Director-General of the Association of\nBritish Pharmaceutical Industry\nwill be debating such issues. It\nshould be fantastic debate and all\nare welcome.\nFor further details please see\nwww.union.ic.ac.uk/medic/medsin\nAre international pharmaceutical companies so high on their desires for profit that the world is suffering as a consequence?\n9\nfelix\nFriday 17 November 2006\nGLOBALLY SPEAKING environment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Recently, however,\nthe cost of discovering and developing a new drug has increased dra-matically. The simple drugs have\nalready been discovered, and finding new ones is taking ever longer.\nIt now costs an average of around\n$800 million to get a new drug onto\nthe shelves, and this figure runs\ninto billions if you consider the cost\nof all the failed attempts. Professor\nBains\u2019 latest business, Delta G, is\ncurrently leading a quiet revolution\nin the drugs discovery industry.\nDelta G is based on research into\nmitochondrial bioenergetics. Using\nan understanding of how mitochondria fail as we age, they are working\nto develop novel pharmaceuticals to\ntreat a variety of cancers. Already\nseveral patents have been filed, and\nthey hope to be able to license their\ntechnology to larger pharmaceutical companies who will help deliver\nthe drug to the marketplace.\nOn Wednesday 21 November, Professor Bains is coming to Imperial\nwhere he will be talking not only\nabout his new business, but also\nabout entrepreneurship in general.\nHe will be offering his accumulated\ninsight and wisdom on how best\nto launch your own start-up.

    "content": "20 felix Friday 17 November 2006\nFEATURE felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArtists\nYours truly with that hideously pretentious pose\nas well as the production manager,\nMary, and her assistant, Jacqueline. Everyone was friendly and it\nbecame apparent to me that they\nwere extremely focused on the task\nat hand; a personal trait that I would\nreally become aware of once the fif-teen-hour day had finished. Arriving\nat the men\u2019s club, everything was in\nplace: the catering van, Winnebago,\nand make-up lorry. I was drawn towards a small argument that was\nwithin the main marquee. A wavy-haired Irish man was disputing\nsomething with a security guard. I\nintroduced myself and questioned:\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d, rather feebly\nthinking I could help. \u201cAre you \u2018locations\u2019?\u201d asked Paul, the Irish \u20181st\nAD\u2019 or \u2018First Assistant Director\u2019.\nAt this point, I was stumped by industry buzzwords. Prior to working\non I Am Bob, I\u2019d never worked on a\nshort film and my other experiences were at a television production\ncompany and a film distributor. Although these taught me a lot about\nthe media industry, I was in a whole\nnew world.\nMy initial impression of Paul\nwasn\u2019t entirely positive; he felt\nneedlessly aggressive to me, but\nultimately it stemmed from his focused attitude. As the \u20181st AD\u2019, or\neffectively the director\u2019s right hand\nman, he needed to whip people into\nshape, for example, by getting actors on set pronto or shots filmed as\nquickly and efficiently as possible.\nHe was certainly capable of doing\nthis and I respected him for it.\nJean arrived late but leisurely. My\nrole as location runner would begin\nin earnest. Jean was \u2018unit manager\u2019, and it was our duty to ensure\nthat everything ran smoothly; by\nmaintaining safety such as making\nsure wires are gaffer taped down,\nkeeping the nearby residents, as\nwell as club members and owners,\nhappy, and also keeping working\nconditions pleasant. Although I\nwas assigned to be Jean\u2019s gimp, I\ntried to chip in wherever help was\nrequired.\nBy 8am, the location was buzzing.\nThere was a hive of activity as people rushed around preparing for the\nday\u2019s filming to begin. I met Patrick,\nwho was essentially the chief run-ner. Having worked with Paul many\ntimes before, he was an old hand.\nPatrick spoke in a hushed voice, giving little indication of his vast running experience. He seemed very\ntimid to me initially and as time progressed his manner didn\u2019t change.\nHowever, this just endeared him to\nme since he was clearly without a\nswollen ego. One extra I spoke to\nclaimed fame by reminding us he\nwas one of the soldiers in the Gladiator battle scenes. In some senses\nhe was wrong though; he was probably thousands of people in Gladiator, replicated over and over via\nthe wonders of CGI! If Patrick was\nthe Alfred Hitchcock of the running\nworld, then I\u2019m Eli Roth, bursting\nonto the scene.\nGradually the other runners\nturnedup.Whilstmyexperiencewas\nminuscule compared to Patrick\u2019s, I\nmet Will who was a painter living in\nNotting Hill. The boot was on the\nother foot since he\u2019d never worked\nin film or television before. Whilst\ncompetition in the film industry is\ninfamously fierce, team spirit on\nset was always high; nowhere more\nso than between the runners. Runners don\u2019t have careers and egos to\nflaunt, so conversation was light-heartedandjovial.Similarlytothose\ntrepidatious first days at university\ndiscussing your A-Levels with fellow freshers, inevitable discussion\nconcerning previous industry experience abounds. This is not a problem until you begin probing more\nexperienced crew members about\ntheir past work. Naturally, you want\nto make a good impression with the\nprospect of opening doors in the in-dustry. But, whilst I talked to Jean\nfor instance, a slightly slimy \u2018sucking-up\u2019 sensation would creep over\nme. Tact is the order of the day in\nthis industry.\nThe set was dressed and filming\nwould be taking place shortly. Walking through the dancehall, carefully\nhopping over the endless camera\nand lighting cables, it began to\ndawn on me that this was something special I had managed to\nbecome involved with. Attention to\ndetail on set was astounding, right\ndown to notice boards with fake taxi\ncompanies and sleazy fliers demonstrating multi talented young ladies\u2019 services. The art department\nwas very talented, whilst consisting\nof merely three members.\nSir Bob Geldof, or \u2018Bob\u2019 as I may of\ncourse refer to him, arrived. Heads\nturned, fingers pointed and jaws\ntemporarily stopped chatting. Then\nit was back to all hands on deck.\nAfter relaxing briefly in the hired\nWinnebago, make-up and wardrobe\nhad their way with him and he was\nescorted straight to set.\nT\nhe time had come to begin filming. The script\nhad been nurtured and\nthe pregnancy was over.\nFour days of labour were\nabout to be braved. The short film\nwas born in front of my eyes \u2013 it was\nexciting and inspiring viewing. The\nfinest attention to detail is observed\nat all times. Lighting, sound, art,\nacting, and direction are combined\nto produce something entertaining\nand, in this case, extremely funny.\nAs the hard work comes to fruition,\nsatisfaction cascades, building with\neach successful camera set up. I\nbelieve it\u2019s for this reason that people genuinely love working in the\nindustry. Aside from the potential\nof a luxurious lifestyle, endeavour-ing to produce something that will\nimpress and entertain people is incredibly rewarding. There are few\nmedia better for doing this than in\ncinema.\nThe realisation that I Am Bob was\na rather large \u2018short feature\u2019 began\nto set in once I witnessed the scale\nof professionalism. Patrick had\nnever worked on anything of this\nscale and Jean reminded me that\nplenty of shorts are filmed in a bedroom with perhaps a cameraman,\ndirector and an actor. I felt very\nfortunate.\nFilming continued throughout\nthe day. Extra after extra appeared\nfrom the wardrobe department\u2019s\nmagic lorry, dressed with varying\ndegrees of spoof-dom . Personal\nfavourites included Mother Theresa played by a frail and stubborn\neighty-something, Sir Elton John\nimitated by a London cabbie driver\nand Audrey Hepburn who looked\nsimply gorgeous. Less convincing,\nbut equally hilarious was an overweight Superman, a hulking Conan\nthe Barbarian and none other than\nAmerica\u2019s most wanted: Osama\nBin Laden and Saddam Hussein.\nHowever David Bamber stole the\nshow for me: imitating none other\nMaxine Peake as Marilyn Monroe\nThe entrants and hosts of the 14th annual Long Marston look-alike contest\nSir Bob Geldof\nSir Bob Geldof\nDavid Bamber\nCompere\nBrian Conley\nMarilyn Monroe\nMaxine Peake\nSir Elton John\nRay Johnson\nGhandi\nCalvin Cowen\nMother Theresa\nHannah Dea Warner\nElvis Presley\nPaul Richie\nVictoria Beckham\nGill Penny\nDavid Beckham\nKarolie Morris\nSuperman\nRobert Dearle\nSaddam Hussein\nNayaf\nOsama Bin Laden\nKrishnan Tateri\nYasser Arafat\nJohn Townsend\nMikhail Gorbachev\nGraham Strugnell\nSir Winston Churchill\nIan Beyts\nConan the Barbarian\nSteve Bick\nMargaret Thatcher\nCaroline Bernstein\nMichael Jackson\nRonnie Behari\nMick Jagger\nSteve Elson\nPope John Paul II\nTrevor Cooper\nMr Spock\nScott Campell\nGeorge Michael\nBen Skevy\nSherlock Holmes\nHumphrey Ker\nTina Turner\nAlicia Alaine\nPamela Anderson\nJoanne Reading\nScary Spice\nAlicia Banton\nGinger Spice\nOxana Anikana\nMadonna\nMelita Morgan\nThe Queen\nNinette Finch\nAudrey Hepburn\nSabrina Barlow\nDrunk\nGareth Cork\n\n"

    "content": "Britain loses students to US\nLast week, Princeton University\nreported a 65 per cent rise in applications over the past year from\nBritish students. Janet Rapelye,\nthe Dean of admissions, said numbers were expected to grow further\nas Britain\u2019s top-up fees meant that\nstudents could obtain better financial support from a US university\nthan from one in the UK.\nThisannouncementhasprompted\nfears that young people are becoming increasingly disenchanted with\nBritish universities after the introduction of top up fees. Ivy League\ninstitutions are increasingly targeting British schools as they look\nto boost their international intake.\nAround 8,400 British students are\nstudying at US universities, two-thirds as undergraduates.\nJanet Rapelye told a conference\nat the \u00a324,000-a-year Wellington\nCollege in Berkshire, that 100 British youngsters applied to Princeton\nthis year, compared to 61 last year.\nMs Rapelye said the benefits of US\nuniversities were \u201coverwhelming\u201d\nwith better teaching, facilities, accommodation and extra-curricular\nactivities. In addition, she stated\nthat the financial support available\nfrom the top US institutions such as\nPrinceton, Yale and Harvard were\nsecond to none. Anthony Seldon,\nmaster of Wellington, who organized the conference on UK students\nstudying at US universities, said:\n\u201cBritish schools are beginning to\nlose faith in UK universities. Unfamiliarity is no excuse for dismissing\nthe option of a US university educa-tion. I encourage all my pupils to\nconsider US universities alongside\nUK ones. It does take determination\nand courage to break away from\nthe crowd but British students are\nas able as those from any other nation.\u201d This represents a dangerous\ntrend for academic life in the UK\nand is eroding the idea of the UK\nbeing a haven for the world\u2019s stu-dents. With the introduction of top-up fees, average student debt has\nreached \u00a313,000 a year. However,\nmost students are actually leaving\nuniversity with debt of over \u00a322,000.\nComparing the costs of studying\nat Princeton relative to the UK, an\nundergraduate in the US would be\nbilled \u00a324 000.. A vast array of extra\ncurricular activities are available\nin the US from interstate baseball\ncompetitions, football and even\ncheerleading tournaments. Princeton also offers childcare facilities\nand disability services, has one of\nthe best campus universities in the\nworld and collections include more\nthan 6.2 million books, and holdings\nof rare books, prints and archives.\nA UK education will cost \u00a31500 a\nyear in tuition fees. Added to this\nis the cost of accommodation, living materials and (perhaps) the\nodd night on the town This can take\nthe costs of studying anything up\nto \u00a38000 a year, resulting in total\ndebts after graduation being between \u00a320,000 to \u00a330,000. The NUS\nhas been campaigning for the abolishment of tuition fees due to their\neffects at deterring students from\nhigher education. At their recent\ndemonstration on the 29th October\nNUS president Gemma Tumelty\nsaid: \u201cWe really believe that debt\nwill be a huge deterrent on students\nentering education. This year there\nwere 15,000 fewer students - that\u2019s\na huge concern to us, particularly\nwhen government is trying to widen participation.\u201d\nWith increasing demand to increase resources available for\nstudents in higher education institutions it appears unlikely that\ntensions will resolve in the near\nfuture.\nICU President John Collins debating education fees Last Thursday in a NUS Hustings debate\nOmar Hashmi\nPolitics Editor\nA warm welcome back to you\nall from a resurrected Felix\nPolitics! Yes, you thought that\nwe all died and were to spend an\neternity banished from the Felix\nunderworld office, but we\u2019re\nback! And before you know it,\nwe have a new mystery writer.\nOld man Warsaw will be keeping\nyou up to date with his (slightly\nwarped) view of the world. However, I don\u2019t think that anyone\nwill have too many objections to\nthis week\u2019s view - no one really\nlikes Saddam, no one really likes\nthe Republicans!\nWhat will be interesting to\nnote is the link that a change in\nstrategy in US Foreign Policy\nwill make to the so called \u201cglobal\nwar against terror.\u201d Will this give\nhope to those who have seen the\ncurrent foreign policy fail miser-ably, or will it feed into the \u201cideological war.?\u201d What even is this\nwar? And how are we going to\nreact when searching for terror\nsuspects with such a high level\nof paranoia? Thankfully, Imperial\nhas a habit of being cool-headed.\nStudent fees are an everlasting problem. Its not surprising\npeople will use their money elsewhere when they find a better\ndeal. But, I don\u2019t care how we do\nit, students need to have better resources. If we are to face\nhigher fees or to look at other\nfactors, then we have to make\nthe hard decisions. Education is\nmore than just a monetary asset,\nbut idealic priciples calling for\nno fees at all, devoid of all reality,\nsimply cannot work in today\u2019s\nclimate.\nWelcome\nWarsaw\u2019s week\nJustice. Go on; say it again, in front\nof the mirror, whilst you\u2019re shav-ing. It\u2019s a lovely word isn\u2019t it? We\nall love it when justice gets done;\njust the last week the politicians of\nCapitol Hill celebrated when they\npassed sentence (and by \u2018they\u2019 I\nobviously mean Iraqi judges, no\nambiguity intended, oh no) on\nSaddam Hussein, putting this evil\nscum-bag to death and ending the\nera of lawlessness in Iraq. I think.\nAnyway, justice leaves you warm\nand fuzzy inside, doesn\u2019t it? (Well,\nnot for Saddam, he\u2019ll be dead. But\nthat\u2019s by the bye.)\nAt least there was one genuine\ncase of justice being done last week\nin the US mid-term elections. No,\ndon\u2019t turn over; I know I read the\nGuardian and hence I\u2019m incredibly\nbitter about the whole world, but\nthat doesn\u2019t mean that this column\nwill descend into another \u201cGeorge\nBush is an eejid\u201d piece. Anyway a\nbit of politics on Friday will make\nyou sleep better. And not because\nit\u2019s boring.\nLast week the Democrats won a\nlandslide vote which helped them\nwin a majority in the US Senate.\nThe seat which tipped the balance\nhere was Virginia, previously held\nby Republican George Allen, with a\nstrong majority.\nSo what went wrong? Whilst on\nthe campaign trail, George Allen turned to a man videoing his\nspeech and suddenly referenced\nhim: \u201cThis feller over here in the\nyellow shirt, Macaca or whatever his name is\u2026\u201d and asked the\ncrowd to give a \u201cWarm welcome to\nMacaca here\u201d.\nAfter the initial confusion and\nspeculation over whether he was\nhitting the crack-pipe at all, it was\nthen pointed out that the person he\nwas referring to, Mr. S.R. Sidarth,\nwas of Indian descent, and Macaca\nis an obscure racial slur, as it\nequates people to monkeys of the\nMacaca genus. Oops.\nMr. Allen tried to apologise af-terwards, but matters were not\nhelped when it came out that he\nhas a history of showing off the\nConfederate flag; by wearing it as\na pin badge and putting it up in his\nliving room, and when recounting\nthe Civil War he did not mention\n(never mind denounce) slavery at\nall. Double Oops.\nThis incident caused Mr. Allen\nto lose his majority on the area,\nand he lost his seat (and thus the\nRepublican hold on the Senate) by\n7,000 votes. Not only that but with\nthis incident marring his political\ncareer there\u2019s little chance of him\nsuccessfully standing as the Republican presidential candidate for\nthe 2008 election. Big oops.\nSouthern-fried justice; tasty. Better still, history has shown us that\nthere\u2019s no chance that a politician\nwith a history of racial insensitivity forming his own splinter party\nto gain power, is there, Robert Kilroy-Silk? My oops.\nWarsaw\nMI5 intelligence discussion\nLast week the Director General of\nthe MI5, Dame Eliza ManninghamBuller, gave a speech at Queen\nMary College, London in which she\nwarned of the continuing threat of\nterrorism to Great Britain and described how the Security Service\nagencies were combating it.\nPointing out that the current\nthreat began well before 9/11,\nDame Eliza cited a range of factors\nthat were motivating acts of terror-ism, such as perceived injustices\nagainst Muslims around the world,\nextreme interpretations of Islam\nand aspects of UK foreign policy.\nDame Eliza noted that the threat\nhas increased steadily since 9/11\nand currently the Security Service\nand police were aware of dozens of\nplots to kill people and damage the\nBritish economy, with 200 networks\nand over 1,600 individuals currently\nunder investigation.\nShe was addressing an invited audience of academics, students and\njournalists as a guest of Professor\nPeter Hennessy. The Group is an\narm of the Mile End Institute for\nthe Study of British Government,\nIntelligence and Society.\nThe Security Service is currently\nexpanding to meet the threat, but\nDame Eliza warned that even when\nit reaches its projected target of\n3,500 staff by 2008, it would not be\nable to prevent every terror attack.\nDuring her speech, Dame Eliza\nelaborated on classical objections\nto such reports that simply \u201cstir up\nfear\u201d. Although other threats such\nas climate change and road accidents may appear to be more harmful to the country at present, she\nput forward the view that another\nterrorist attack would be disastrous\nfor the global, economy.\nThis news couples along with other reports that Islamic extremists\nhave infiltrated at least four British universities in order to radical-ise Muslim students. According to\nSheikh Musa Admani, Brunel University in west London, Bedfordshire University, Luton, Sheffield\nHallam University and Manchester\nMetropolitan University have all\nbeen infiltrated by radical elements\nthat host events and lectures with\nexternal speakers which allegedly\nbring other Muslims towards more\nextreme outlooks.\nYahya Khan\nDame evaluates Islam and the role of the security services\nHowever, a study for the Joseph\nRowntree Reform Trust said ministers must stop using \u201cmisleading\nand disproportionate\u201d language on\nterrorism, which \u201callows terrorists\nto assume the dignity of being soldiers or combatants instead of the\ncriminals that they are\u201d.\nIt says the only way of successfully tackling terrorism is to win the\ntrust and cooperation of Muslim\ncommunities in the UK, in particular those young people who provide\nthe tacit support that allows terrorism to survive.\nThere has been much speculation\nabout what motivates young men\nand women to carry out acts of terrorism in the UK. Muslim groups,\nsuch as the Muslim Council of Britain, have previously voiced their\nconcern that the Government has\nnot recognised the link between\nforeign policy in the Muslim world\ncausing widespread and deep frustration in Muslims in Britain.\nA press release on the 18th August 2006 stated that \u201cit cannot be\nsaid enough that there can never\nbe any justification for the deliberate killing of civilians. However, the\nGovernment needs to acknowledge\nthat extremist groups have taken\nadvantage of Britain\u2019s role in the\nwars against Afghanistan and Iraq\nand Washington\u2019s longstanding\nblind support for Israel as an opportunity to recruit more Muslims\u201d.\nUniversities have\nbeen infiltrated\nby radical\nelements that\nhost events\n5\nfelix\nFriday 17 November 2006\nPOLITICS politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Love it or loath it most people will have heard of, or been too\n(especially if you were schooled at a\nfee paying institution) a lovely part\nof the world called Henley-uponThames. This is the highlight of the\nrowing calendar, and a win there in\nthe summer makes all the ridiculous training worth it.\nIn July, Henley is the finishing\nline at the end of a gruelling obstacle course of competitive rowing\nraces. No obstacle course is easy,\nbut in order to reach the finish you\nhave to complete all the challenges\nalong the way.\nThis time of year involves the long\nslog \u2018head\u2019 races, including the four\nan a quarter mile Head of the River\nRace, and also more welcome trips\nto Amsterdam for the Heineken\nCup. Last weekend however saw\nthe completion of BUSA small\nboats head, the boggy marsh on\nthe assault course. It was an unrequited necessity in search of BUSA\npoints to secure further funding for\nImperial rowing and sport in gen-eral. This event is notoriously badly\nrun, with that \u2018no one really knows\u2019\nkind of work ethic to the marshals\nrunning it.\nBut luckily through a combination of talent and the silly train-ing, Imperial rowers tend to be the\ncommanders on the assault course.\nOut of the 12 small boat categories,\nfor both men and women, Imperial\ntook 9 golds and 2 silvers, medalling\nin every category they entered and\ntaking home three times as many\nBUSA points as any other University. This is an even more impressive\nachievement due to the high standard of the top end entries. Congrats\nto the men\u2019s team of Will Laughton,\nAdam Freeman-Pask, Olly Moore,\nBen Smith and Ole Tiertz, and\nthe ladies team of Mathilda Pauls,\nCynthia Mynhardt, Helen Ellison,\noutgoing women\u2019s captain Rachael \u2018chewy\u2019 Davies, Kay Jacks and\nClarice Chung. This result firmly\nplaces IC at the pinicle of student\nrowing in the country.\nInterested in coxing for the IC rowing team? No previous experience\nrequired. Contact simon.hislop@\nimperial.ac.uk for information\nOne Wednesday in November, 12\nwarriors travelled from South Ken\nto the depths of North West London\nanticipating one of the fiercest battles ever.\nFrom the tip off Imperial were\nin control, looking like champions,\nbut in skin tight kit. Every offence\nwas sexy and Westminster couldn\u2019t\ncope. We were playing perfect bas-ketball, setting screens, rolling, cut-ting, working hard on defence, maxing and relaxing.\nBy the end of the first quarter\nImperial were dominating 28-6, the\nonly criticism being that they were\nallowed to score 6.\nWords of encouragement issued\ngoing into the second quarter\nwere \u201cthese guys are big, but very\nstupid\u201d. Imperial restarted impressively with Rob scoring from\noutside and Naaman working the\ninside well.\nMidway through the second quarter with Imperial running the show,\nWestminster began to press, forcing turnovers and fouls. Imperial\nstruggled to pass out of the press,\nturning over the ball and dropping\nbaskets.\nToday was an important day for the\n1st team in terms of position in the\nleague, by winning we would secure\nthe top spot in the league, and our\nopponents today were a team that\nhad not won a game so far.\nPreparation for the game went\nsmoothly, although with 45 minutes\n\u2018till kick off, there was neither an\nopposition nor a referee. Both eventually did arrive and the game got\nunderway. IC started the first half\nwith all guns blazing, and even the\nforwards had something to shout\nabout as they won a lineout and\ndrove it over the line, to give Alex\nBaines-Buffery his first try this\nseason. The second try for IC game\nfairly quickly after that, with James\nFletcher intercepting a pass from\ntheir fly-half but the conversion was\nmissed.\nThings were going well with\nmovement general yet again working perfectly, but then 20 minutes\nin, the game turned with the referee awarding a controversial penalty try to South Bank, even though\nthey\u2019d already passed the try line.\nTheir second try was yet another\npenalty try as Rob Phillipps held\nback the runner on his way to the\ntry line, and IC could have conceded a third as Baines-Buffery tackled\na guy 5 meters from our line, without the guy actually having the ball.\nHalf time score was 14-12 to South\nBank.\nThings had to change in the sec-Basketball\nImperial 1sts 85\nWestminster 1sts 74\n1sts extra time win\nScandal at Harlington as some Rugby players were left able to stand following post match celebrations\nMens Rugby\nICURFC 1st XV 26\nSouth Bank University 26\nond half, and they did with several\nsubstitutions. First was Jov, who\nstill hasn\u2019t managed to finish a full\ngame, with a suspected broken\nthumb; then eventually Jo Brown\nwho just woke up of the pitch, not\ntoo sure how he got there. But\non the pitch, things weren\u2019t going well; with South Bank getting\na further two tries through some\nquick hands in the backs. IC were\nnot having the best of days, with\nballs being dropped at crucial moments and the forwards being a bit\nhesitant in the rucks, meant that\nnone of our opportunities were\never finished. But after South Bank\nscored their two tries, things fell\ninto place with a try from Flannan\n(finally) in the corner, where Fletch\nmanaged to drop kick the conversion and then some good phases\nfrom the forwards to allow Hixxy\nover the line under the posts, which\nFletch converted easily.\nThe game finished after that final conversion, but with neither\nside sure of who\u2019d won. No one was\nsure whether it was 28-26 to South\nBank or 26-24 to IC since everyone\nseemed to have lost track of the\nconversions. In the end, the referee\ndecided it was a draw at 26 all, to\nwhich both teams were surprised\nyet no complaints were made. Special mentions go to Luke Taylor\na.k.a. ACC Chair, a.k.a.

You can boil, fry, poach or\nbake them or whip up a meal in the\nform of an omelette.\nBoiled eggs\nOne of the most basic ways to serve\nup an egg, but also often messed\nup. Soft boil them and serve with\nbuttered soldiers, or boil them a\nlittle longer for a hard yolk and use\nin salads and other dishes. There\nare a few rules to follow if you want\nyour egg perfectly boiled. Very cold\neggs are likely to crack if you put\nthem in boiling water, so try not to\ntake them straight from the fridge.\nA small egg in a large pan is likely to bump around and result in a\ncracked egg too. An accurate timer\nis also essential; guessing timings\nis the perfect way to ruin a boiled\negg.\nFor an infallible method do as\nfollows:\nPlace your eggs in a small pan\nand cover with cold water so that it\nis at least 1cm above the top of the\negg. Bring the water up to the boil\nand then reduce the heat so the water is simmering and use the following timings:\n3 minutes if you want your yolk\nvery runny and a wobbly white.\n4 minutes if you want a yolk that is\ncreamy and a white that is set.\n5 minutes for a yolk that is set\nChelsea\u2019s little Italy is reasonable and rustic\nThis summer, a rather funny thing\nhappened; we woke up with splitting headaches after an exceptionally heavy night at Boujis and decided we wanted some food. Free\nfood to be precise, and so decided\nhenceforth that though our current\npositions as Felix nightlife reviewers provided us with free alcohol,\nman cannot live on champagne and\nthe occasional canap\u00e9 alone, and\nthe time had come to masquerade\nas food critics.\nYes, I hear most of you cry, we\nmight not know a couchant du mere\nif it fell into our bowl of tautet sur\nvin, but we thought we could learn\nthis as we went along. On that particular morning, we both had a penchant for pizza, so we set off through\nthe streets of Chelsea in search of\na suitable establishment. The Hut\nwas too common, Express told us\nto \u2018piss off\u2019 and as for Organic - let\u2019s\nnot go there. After an exhaustive\nsearch, we chanced upon a cosy\nItalian restaurant on the Fulham\nRoad, located conveniently around\nthe corner from Evelyn Gardens\ncalled Riccardo\u2019s\nUpon entering, we instantly felt at\nhome with the rustic Italian d\u00e9cor\nand promptly took a seat in the conservatory area that projected onto\nthe street; proving an ideal vantage point for viewing the hoards of\nshoppers, sloaney ponies and ano-rexic, chiwawa-sporting yummy-mummies bustling past.\nAfter a brief chat with the cheerful (and genuinely Italian) staff, we\nwere introduced to the eponymous\nowner Senor Riccardo Marriti, a\ncharming middle aged Florentine\nwith a faint hint of Rupert Everett about him. After quizzing him\nin our pidgin Italian, we found out\nhe spoke flawless English and he\nproceeded to tell us of his desire to\nintroduce traditional family Florentine recipes to a wider audience.\nTo start, we sampled a large tomato and mozzarella salad, liberally drenched in olive oil. Simple\nbut delicious. An established food\ncritic, a silver tongued courtesan of\nthe courses, might have highlighted that the avocado accentuated\nthe textual variation of the dish,\nwhilst wonderfully complementing\nthe beefy tomatoes and the firm,\nmature mozzarella \u2013 very much\nreminiscent of our early childhood\nin the hills of Tuscany\u2026 However\nwe prefer to honour it with the epithet of: \u2018\u2018f**king tasty\u2019.\nThe main course proved another\ncarnival of delights. One of us sampled a Margherita Pizza (nice and\nsimple- strong hint of oregano), the\nother a special pasta compiled by\nthe chef (a unique and novel com-bination). The home-made Italian\ndairy ice-cream, served with excellent coffee, proved a wonderful\nend to a fabulous meal, and the accompanying house-white was crisp,\ndry and complemented the courses\nperfectly. The restaurant has a busy\natmosphere, with everyone chatting to everyone else, whilst Riccardo flits between tables. One of us\nhappened to mention knife-throw-ing in the conversation and, before\nwe could stop him, Riccardo had\ndrawn one of his wooden shutters,\nand was brandishing a steak-knife.\nIn conclusion, Riccardo\u2019s is a\nfabulously social slice of Italy in the\nchic surroundings of Chelsea, and\nthe surprisingly cheap prices led to\nit being ideal date material\u2026 Bon\nappetito!\nConor Mosli Lynch\n& Michael Lowley\nRiccardo\u2019s: provides an ideal vantage point for viewing the hoards of shoppers, sloaney ponies and\nanorexic-chiwawa-sporting-yummy-mummies bustling down the Fulham Road\nRiccardo\u2019s\n126 Fulham Road\n0207 370 6656\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nFancy some food\nfor free?

Already into the chorus of Somewhere\nOnly We Know, the eight-thousand\nstrong crowd, bristling with energy,\nresponded, screaming out into the\nnight. We provided the backing vocals for Keane as the brilliant vocals\nof Tom, the symphonic genius of pianist Tim Rice-Oxley and the eclectic drumming of Richard Hughes\ngave London what it came to hear:\nsheer musical magnificence.\nThe opening act, Captain, provided the crowd with a bizarre but\nmesmerizing sound-scape whose\nguitar and synthesising performance kept the audience\u2019s atten-tion, but they were soon eclipsed\nby the main act. Keane blew us all\naway right from the start with the\nopening instrumental Iron Sea, and\ncheers exploded towards the stage\nas each of the trio individually made\ntheir journey onto the stage at the\nglorious Alexandra Palace.\nDuring each and every song,\nthe audience participation was as-tounding. Everyone knew every\nword and it pleased Keane no doubt\nthat they were standing above us\nall watching us in unison sing along\nto the likes of Leaving So Soon, Try\nAgain and Everybody\u2019s Changing.\nThe latter of which caused hands to\nsimultaneously reach towards the\nceiling in such an amazing display\nit can only be described as epic.\nThe stage itself was incredible;\nthe lightning effects were, honestly,\nsecond-to-none, and the plasma\nscreens provided images relevant\nto each song. A Bad Dream, a very\natmospheric song about war was\naccompanied by images of people\ntrying to evade the bombings and\nfrantically put on their gas masks,\nand it helped provide a sense of\nawe I haven\u2019t experienced since the\nlikes of Radiohead.\nOf course, Keane are a piano-led\nthree-piece, but that didn\u2019t stop\nTom bringing out an acoustic guitar\nfor a very rare acoustic version of\nYour Eyes Open, much to everyone\u2019s delight. He claimed not to be\nable to play it very well but it was\npretty hard to tell as it could barely\nbe heard over the audience\u2019s roaring collective voice.\nOne of the many highlights of\nthe gig was Hamburg Song, essentially their version of Coldplay\u2019s\nThe Scientist, (apologies for the\nobvious comparison), which filled\nthe venue with heartfelt emotion\nand it seemed to really touch the\naudience. Written by the primary\ncomposer of Keane, Tim, it was, in\nTom\u2019s own words, \u201cA request for me\nto become the person I was instead\nof the person I became\u201d.\nTom\u2019s banter with the crowd was\nthe best I have heard. Poking fun at\nhimself about his recent rehabilita-tion, referring to the audience as\ntheir \u2018choir\u2019 and \u2018the most beautiful people of London\u2019 and playfully\nreferring to the venue as Ally Pally.\nIt reached a brilliant and sudden\nlive reviews\nKeane\nAlexandra Palace\nclimax when he jumped into the\ncrowd, singing to specific people\nand causing thousands to swarm\naround him.\nThe encore was suitably atmos-pheric, with Atlantic producing a\nvery dark, brooding mood which\nwas suddenly shattered as Crystal\nBall\u2019s upbeat lyrics reigned down\nupon the thousands of fans. Bedshaped was, as usual, chosen as the\nclosing song, and proved to be the\nbest conclusion to a gig in recent\nmemory. As the thousands sang\nalong, Tom clearly showed some\nsigns of faltering as the true emotion of the gig overwhelmed him,\nand the beauty of the song itself\nwas clear to see and to hear.\nFrom the thunderous pseudo-guitar track Is It Any Wonder to\nthe calming, saddening We Might\nAs Well Be Strangers, Keane showcased their entire second album\nand the best of their first with undeniable skill.\nThe audience participation, the\nmusical quality, and overall the al-most-tangible bond Keane seemed\nto have with the crowd was inde-scribable, but I\u2019ve given it my best\nshot, and I\u2019m afraid that will have to\nsuffice. To truly appreciate Keane,\nas you would any band, you have to\ngo see them for yourselves. I could\nhardly recommend this band anymore than this.\nOne thousand lucky members of\nthe audience received copies of this\ngig recorded to CD, and if you listen carefully you can hear someone\nshout out \u201cImperial\u201d during one of\nthe quieter moments. In comparison to Keane\u2019s contribution to the\nlives of thousands of music fans, my\nattempted advertisement of this\nfine institution seems pretty mea-gre. Nevertheless, it does prove\nthat I was there, and that is what\ntruly matters to me and many oth-ers; we were there to experience\nsomething incredibly difficult to put\ndown in words.\nRobin Andrews\nLes Incompetents\n100 Club\nLes Incompetents, like The Surfaris and Dire Straits, had me\nintrigued on the basis of a catchy\nname. Me? Easy to please? Yes,\nyes I am thank you, thank you very\nmuch.\nI was pre-warned that they were\nalso pretty big news in London and\narriving at the 100 Club into a hot,\nsweaty basement crammed like a\npack of sardines \u2013 that is, sardines\nwearing trilbies and cravats \u2013 I realised how right that was. I sigh as\nI make my way through the crowds,\nand reluctantly hand over \u00a31.30 for\nhalf a can of diet coke. The music\nbetter be good.\nLes Incompetents start setting up\non-stage,andunfortunately,withme\nbeing a meagre 5\u20193\u201d, my view is not\nspectacular. I see glimpses of suits,\nwaistcoats and silver sequined\nhead bands. The singer looks like a\nmutant hybrid of Rivers Cuomo and\nJarvis Cocker, assembled in the underground sewers of London per-haps. His girlfriend Peaches walks\npast me, and I live up to my reputation of being a little slow when I\nrealise the old guy behind her is her\ndad. What\u2019s his name? Bob Geldof!\nThe bewilderment is then replaced\nby a great huge stabbing pain when\nhe steps on my foot.\nSounds starts to fill the air; loud\nbursts of energetic sound that hit\nyour face with a whack. They are\nreally pulling out all the stops to-night. I hear jangly melodies around\nska-beats and tweaky guitars. The\nwords Babyshambles, The Libertines and a smidgen of Reel Big\nFish come to mind, but there\u2019s also\na form of innocence and fun that\nmakes Les Incompetents stand\nout. They play a full back catalogue\nof songs including crowd-pleasers\nHow It Went Wrong, the clappy guitar explosion Reunion, that is sung\nso close to being out of tune it works,\nand Much Too Much. They look a\nwreck on-stage and the dry asides\nare plentiful and sarcastic, but the\nsound is tight, passionate and if you\nlisten carefully, you can hear technical brilliance. The crowd is gratuitously loyal, shouting out requests,\nsinging to their heart\u2019s content and\nstarting what looks like a monster\nmash-up in front. Dancing becomes\ninfectious with symptoms ranging\nfrom the head-bob, to a fever of jazz\nhands and then the acute flinging of\none\u2019s legs.\nIronically, a new song is played,\nwhich is almost too much of a cock-tease for the crowd. The audience\nlap up a pretty shoddy cover of\nthe White Stripes, but at this point\nthey\u2019d jump for glee if the band\nthrew human faeces, or even marbles at them. Which they did. The\nmarbles I mean.\nThe hour long set goes by quick-ly, mainly due to restarting Much\nToo Much five times as a dig to the\nredundant previous bassist Ollie\nRose (a quick check on Wikipedia\nquotes that he was forced to leave\nthe band when his guitar was \u2018stolen by a gypsy\u2019). Although I do like\nthe sound of Billy\u2019s voice (a twang\nof drunken slurring and that clich\u00e9\nLondon accent; better than your\nIrish/South African/Klingon one\nLuke of The Kooks) his interludes\nof random heckling and antics did\ngrow a bit tiresome.\nThe music stops and I come up\nfor air and a quick run to the tube\nstation. I\u2019m sat waiting for Cockfosters (the tube) and it hits me that\nthe beautiful mess of sound I\u2019ve just\nheard won\u2019t ever be performed onstage again. Why the band are splitting up I\u2019m not sure; irreconcilable\ndifferences, new projects or maybe\nthey really are just incompetent.\nBut at least Geldof stood on my\nfoot.\nLia Han\nLes Incompetents extremely competent last gig\nLes Incompetents...proof that opening umbrellas indoors isn\u2019t unlucky if you want to put on a good show\nUp close and far too personal with the boyish Tom, fresh and rosy-cheeked from hockey practice\nROBIN ANDREWS\n15\nfelix\nFriday 17 November 2006\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Companies are always looking for\nways to improve profitability and\nmake more money. To do this, a\ncompany may try merging with another or buying and acquiring another company. This can improve\nthe business\u2019s economies of scale,\nimprove synergy and can increase\nmarket share. It is this last point\nwhich regulators are interested in.\nIn the UK, a merger cannot go\nahead if it will \u201cresult in a substantial lessening of competition in a UK\nmarket\u201d according to the Office of\nFair Trading (OFT) under the Enterprise Act 2002. The OFT will refer any merger that will result in a\nturnover above a certain threshold,\nor will result in the company having\nover 25% of a market to the Competition Commission (CC), which is an\nindependent body, for investigation.\nThe OFT wants to encourage a fair\nmarket where there is not a monopoly and normal market forces\napply to protect the consumer. If\nthese rules were not employed, monopolies would be formed with supply being manipulated and prices\nincreasing dramatically.\nIn the year 2000, Time Warner\nand AOL planned to merge in what\nwould create a company worth $245\nbillion. With both being huge multinational companies, the takeover would be heavily scrutinised\nto make sure there was not a decrease in competition and that a\nmonopoly was not formed. Of particular concern was the links between Time Warner with EMI and\nBertelsmann. It was worried that\nAOL would be able to use EMI and\nBertelsmann to dominate the then\nmerging online music industry. To\navoid a monopoly in this area, it was\nagreed that Time Warner would not\nmerge with EMI as had been earlier\nplanned, and that all ties with Bertelsmann would be severed. With\nthese promises, the EU gave the\ngo ahead for the merger, and with\nsome negotiations in America with\nUS regulators, AOL Time Warner\nwas formed.\nMerger control regimes are there\nto help protect the consumer by\nmaking sure competition in a market continues. Companies have to\nabide by their rulings but can often\nbe proactive in making sure that\nthey are not substantially affecting\ncompetition. Companies can agree\nto sell off parts of their business to\nmake sure that they do not get an\nunfair advantage from a subsidiary\nor do not have a monopoly in a geographical area. With these rules fol-lowed, normal market forces will allow businesses to run healthily and\nconsumers experience competitive\nprices.\nWhat can you do with a paper clip?\nThese are the words that sparked\noff the creative energy of those\npresent at the first team building event on Tuesday evening of\nSparkACompany, an interuniversi-ty business competition run by Imperial Entrepreneurs and LSE Entrepreneurs which intends to help\naccelerate 6 student start ups by\nMarch 2007. The night played host\nto some of the top entrepreneurs in\nthe country as both societies aimed\nto ignite the entrepreneurial scene\nat Imperial by getting students to\nactively start building companies.\nThe first in a series of events saw\nthe members primed for entrepreneurial and creative thought by actively engaging with the impressive\nguest list of entrepreneurs present,\nincluding a famous alumnus of\nImperial, Paul Birch who founded\nbebo.com and Birthday Alarm. Also\npresent on the night were James\nMurray Wells, UK Entrepreneur of\nthe year 2005 and founder of glass-esdirect.co.uk, Walid Al Saqqaf and\nSokratis Papafloratos, founders of\ntrustedplaces.com and recent Imperial Graduate Sachin Duggal, a\nmillionaire at the age of 18.\nThe evening kicked off with a\nlittle bit of light networking over\nsome drinks and pizza, and an introduction by Imperial Entrepreneurs President Sumon Sadhu.\n\u201cThere are many students at Imperial who have amazing business\nideas, but are afraid to go out and\njust do it because of a lack of sup-port, SparkACompany provides just\nthat, we\u2019ve secured the business\nservices of companies like Ernst &\nYoung (accounting), Olswang (law)\n\u201cGo straight to jail, do not pass go,\ndo not collect \u00a3200\u201d, a particularly\nharsh punishment for someone attempting to create a monopoly of all\nthe hotels in London. Whilst just a\nboard game, it does reflect parts of\nthe business world.\nA monopoly occurs when there is\njust one company providing a good\nto the market. This total dominance\nmeans that the monopoly is in total\ncontrol of supply and can therefore\ncontrol prices.\nMonopolies can happen when a\ngovernment creates or gives the\nrights for one to be created usually\nwith regards to a public service. It\nalso occurs more naturally, when a\ncompany takes control of the market through economies of scale or\nhaving the sole rights to a resource\nor idea.\nFor years, the Royal Mail has\nbeen a government owned mo-nopoly. If you had wanted to send a\nletter, you had to do it via the Royal\nMail. However, it is carefully regulated by Postcomm. This regulation\nensures that Royal Mail provides a\ngood service at a reasonable price\nfor the customers, so its monopoly\nwas not taken advantage of. Although still dominant, the market\nhas been opened up to competition\nwith other carriers being allowed to\ndeliver post. This should help keep\nprices and services competitive.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Windows runs on\n90% of all desktop computers. They\nachieved this through the peoples\nwant for Windows as an operating system, particularly in the corporate market, along with a lot of\nhard work. However many people\nbelieve that Microsoft intimidates\nother companies either intention-Jayraj Choksi\nBusiness Correspondent\nand WPP (marketing) to get all our\nyoung start ups off the ground\u201d,\nsaid SparkACompany head Jayraj\nChokshi. Sumon Sadhu, a serial\nentrepreneur at the age of 23, said\n\u201cLondon is probably the best place\nin Europe to start a company and\nImperial offers the largest concentration of technically minded\nstudents to create billion dollar\ncompanies like Google, EBay and\nAmazon\u201d.\nMuch of the rest of the evening\nfeatured brainstorming and the\nattendees on the night spent the\nlength of the event bouncing ideas\n4 felix Friday 17 November 2006\nBUSINESS business.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nally by trying to squeeze them out\nof the market with their own products or unintentionally by scaring\nthem from rivalling such a large\ncompany. The EU agrees with this\nand has demanded that Microsoft\nopens up codes to rivals to allow\nthem to develop compatible pro-grammes, with Microsoft facing\nfines of $2 million a day.\nSometimes monopolies are sen-sible, in particular when dealing\nwith a public service, such as water\nor electricity, where it would be far\ntoo expensive for every company to\nhave their own pipes or wires going\nin to your house. In such instances,\nit is important that such monopolies are carefully regulated to protect the consumer. However, other\ntimes monopolies occur through\nother means. Because this is not\nillegal it is important to make sure\nthat monopolies do not abuse their\npowers with regulators protecting\nconsumers, or consumers protecting themselves by taking their money elsewhere.\noff each other. Walid and Socratis,\nprovided the most engaging question of the night when they asked\nthe audience \u201cWhat can you do with\na paperclip?\u201d and started off a wave\nof crazy, imaginative and some\ndown right off the wall ideas!\nIt seemed to have worked though,\nsome genuinely intriguing and\nwacky ideas were brought up, including the suggestion of curing\nAIDS with a paperclip! By painting\nit red and giving it to U2\u2019s frontman\nBono to launch a new charitable\neffort, \u201cRed clips for AIDS campaign!\u201d. There was also an airline\nidea where passengers are carried\nin sleeping capsules (which apparently can be ejected and parachuted to safety in the event of a crash!)\nand a more down to earth proposal\nwhich focused around low-fare London travel on buses with no seats.\nThe evening closed off with a\nDragon\u2019s Den style public pitching of ideas. All the entrepreneurs\npresent on the night were called up\nto the front with each of the teams\npitching their idea to them. The idea\nwas then developed further by everyone brainstorming it up to a more\nmarketable proposition, which\ngave a unique insight into how real\nentrepreneurs turn a crazy concept\ninto scaleable reality.\nThe competition now moves into\nits next phase on 22 November at\nthe LSE where the actual team\nbuilding process will gather pace\nand new companies will be formed.\nMore mergers and markets Monopoly power\nPaul Estruch\nBusiness Correspondent\nImperial and LSE entrepreneurs hosted an event where audience members were asked what they could\ndo using a paper clip.

The Yes campaign\ndid not. Mr Sherliker duly charged\nthe campaign for the advert, and\npublished it in the issue he distributed around campus on Tuesday\nevening.\nThe Yes campaign, on seeing\nthe newspaper, submitted a com-plaint, the gist of which was that\nMr Sherliker hadn\u2019t approached\nthem to place an advert, knowing\nthat the No campaign already had\nan advert. Mr Matthews response\nwas to tour the campus with Felix\u2019s\ndistribution trolley and seize all the\navailable copies of Guildsheet, stopping short of taking it from people\u2019s\nhands.\nMr Sherliker responded to the\ncomplaint by pointing out that one\nof the prominent members of the\nYes campaign, John Collins (who is\nalso Union President, though acting in a personal capacity for this\nreferendum), was a previous Guildsheet editor, and therefore should\nhave known that advertising in the\nnewspaper was possible.\nMr Collins responded in kind by\nsaying that if he was Guildsheet\neditor, he\u2019d have approached the\nYes campaign in the hope of making\nmore money from their advert.\nThe move to impound Guildsheet\nmet with widespread criticism from\nthe No campaign, and guarded\nskepticism from the Yes camp.\nStephen Brown, a well-known figurehead for the No camp, said:\n\u201cThe rules say that both sides of\nthe argument must have equal ac-The student newspaper\nof Imperial College\nNo. 1,364 \u2022 Friday \u2022\n17 November 2006 \u2022\nfelixonline.co.uk\nfelix\nfelix\npage\npage\nAndy Sykes\nEditor-in-chief\ncess to media, whether or not they\nchoose to take advantage of it is\nentirely up to them.

I made a\ncomplaint because I felt we hadn\u2019t\nbeen offered fair access to student\nmedia.\u201d Mr Guite does have a good\nrecord on freedom of the press; as\nPhysical Science Union President,\nhe was the first to make Broadsheet, the PSU newspaper, edito-rally independent and increased its\nbudget, and he stood by Matthew\nHartfield, its editor last year, when\nattempts were made to reverse\nthese changes.\nMr Matthews spoke to Felix about\nthe impounding, saying: \u201cThis was\nan unfortunate event, but I took\nthe steps necessary to protect the\nreferendum.\u201d He also raised the\nalarming possibility of votes cast\nduring the period that Guildsheet\nwas available being discounted if\nanalysis of voting times showed that\nthese votes changed the outcome of\nthe referendum. This was met with\noutrage by Stephen Brown, a well-known No campaigner, who pointed\nout that during the evening Guildsheet was available, the size of the\n\u201cNo NUS\u201d group on Facebook more\nthan tripled, and that some of these\npeople may have voted during that\nevening, completely unrelated to\nGuildsheet advert, and that these\nvoters would be disenfranchised.\nMr Matthews referred to precedent when defending his decision;\napparently, ex-President Mustafa\nArif had interpreted an election\nregulation concerning student\nmedia interviewing candidates or\npublishing debates requiring three\ndays notice to all candidates as applying to advertising as well.\nThe NUS referendum descends into farce, with Guildsheet impounded and talk of conspiracy on campus\nContinued on page 2\nAbove: Returning Officer for the referendum, Jon Matthews, collecting copies of Guildsheet from around\ncampus, using the Felix trolley.

We were also without a goalie until RSM kindly lent us\nSammy at the last minute. Thankfully, not only did we have a goalkeeper but also 3 substitutes, somewhat unheard of for ladies hockey.\nIC got off to a great start with\nAmanda scoring within the first\ncouple of minutes, closely followed\nby her lovely little sister, Melissa,\nadding another- all within the first\nfive minutes!\nEncouragement from the sidelines spurred us on and the opposition were beginning to tire visibly.\nThere were fantastic runs up the\nwings from Jenny on the right and\nTrish and Laura on the left.The ball\nrarely left the St Barts half, leaving\nSammy a little bored in goal. IC\u2019s\n8th goal went in and luckily, for St\nBarts, the half time whistle followed\nand oranges were consumed.\nAt this point Fi introduced another incentive (as if winning was not\nenough). If 17 or more goals were\nscored, beating last seasons record\n(a 16-0 win by the mens 4s), she\nwould buy an a round for the entire\nteam. Knowing certain alcoholics\namongst them, it would include the\nmost expensive drinks available,\nleaving our poor captain penniless\nfor the rest of term. With the stakes\nraised IC went out with even more\nvigour than usual and started the\npressure again. Mala was fantastic\nas centre half and Shirley, on the\nleft wing, created even more chances for goal scoring opportunities.\nThe defence were working just\nas hard pushing up and intercepting any stray balls. They were on\ngood form with Izzy, Bella and Han\ngetting stuck in. Sheena and her\nhousemate, Alice (two Alices, both\nginger; very confusing) worked well\nas a doulble act!\nThe quality of the hockey degraded slightly as Barts continued\nto give away short corners, the last\nplay of the match was another IC\ngoal from a short corner.\nThe final goal count was as fol-lows; Amanda 5 (more than she\nscored all of last season), Mala 3\n(not bad for her first match for IC),\nMelissa 2 (obviously learning from\nher big sis) Jenny 1 (another fantastic IC debut) Shirley 1 (hopefully\nthe first of many) and Fi 1 (undoubt-edly the only one of the season!).\nTo top of a great match, teas were\nprovided and Laura stepped up as\na very strict fines master; Alice was\nworking too hard, before heading\nback for the usual shenanigans at\nthe union!\nOnly a couple of weeks after crushing the 3rd team the IC ladies were\nonce again optimistic about their\nchances against St Barts 2nds.\nDespite the wintry weather, we\nburst onto the pitch full of energy\nand eager to get ourselves some\ngoal pie! It was clear from the start\nthat making an appearance at training does help, as we saw a dramatic\nimprovement in our ball control\nand hockey skills.\nThis meant that IC dominated the\ngame from the early stages, playing\na very solid, attacking game with\ngreat support from Izzy, Shirley\nand Bella pushing up from defence\nall the time.\nMarla, taking the critical central\nrole provided an awesome link between defence and the forwards\nthe ball almost always reached the\nstick of a striker. Dasha, Melissa\nand Amanda worked hard upfront,\nespecially in the \u2018D\u2019, shooting at\nevery opportunity.\nShort corners were hardly scarce\nand yet IC found themselves in a\ngoal-less situation. As half time ap-proached, frustration set in and it\nwas time for another inspiring team\ntalk from Fi.\nThe second half started much in\nthe same way as it did in the first,\nwith St Barts surviving on their\nLadies Hockey\nSt Barts & RL 3rds 0\nIC 2nds 12\nIC 2nds 2\nSt Barts & RL 2nds 0\nscrappy but effective defence.\nHowever, IC persevered and were\nawarded another short corner.\nAmanda received the ball and sent\na high speed cross to Marla, by the\ngoal post, amidst the mess of defenders she was able to get a stick\nto it and deliver it across the goal\nline.\nThe second goal followed shortly,\nthis time originating from a long\ncorner. Bella planted a strong final\ntouch to give IC a healthy lead.\nThe result barely reflected the\ndominance of IC\u2019s game, but a third\nwin in a row was, without doubt,\ncause for celebration! Let\u2019s hope\nthere will be many more to come!\nThese young ladies are definitely hockey players. I\u2019m sure this time; the sticks are a dead giveaway.

    "content": "We\u2019re live and in your face\nFour live reviews for your ocular consumption should make you all happy bunnies\nLove and Squalor was a cracking\ndebut album. We Are Scientists\nmanaged to balance catchy songs\nand high production value with wit\nand charm. As with most American bands in the same vein there\nalways appears to be an underlying driving force coming from the\nlabel, polishing their sound into a\nvery Radio 1 friendly hook. This\nwas very noticeable at their gig at\nBrixton Academy, the first in a two\nnight mini-residency.\nCrikey, the gig had so many good\naspects, so lets start with the best.\nThe lighting; yep that was pretty\ngood. They had this nice ambient\nsodium yellow lighting coming in at\nwaist level in between songs which\nbasked them in a vintage aura.\nThen they had these nets of LEDs\nwhich acted a bit like screens. By\nthe sides of those they had these\ntowers of lights, akin to something\nMassive Attack play in front of. Allin-all it was clear there had been a\nlot of money spent on making each\nsong have it\u2019s own little lighting dis-play, something to identify it by, like\na generic pop song.\nWhat else was there? Oh yes, the\nwitty jokes between songs, they\nwere great! About as funny as my\nleft big toe, well it is between that\nand a hot meal \u2013 these guys were\nreally on fire. Oh, and how could I\nforget, the bassist was also mous-tachioed. Apparently now popular,\nit obviously gets the kids to buy\nthe records! So what do we have\nthen? Great lights, check! Jokes\nbetween songs, with a huge dollop of arrogance? Definitely there!\nFashion trend regalia, including a\n\u2018retro\u2019 moustache? Oh yes, I double\nchecked that one!\nBut hold on one cotton picking\nmoment, this is starting to sound\nvery much like a big pop act, not\nsome guitar wielding music kids\nwho had a startlingly good debut\nalbum! So what was the performance like? Well it was like a big pop\nact, dry, lifeless, tired, dull. The\nonly thing which was electric was\nmost certainly their guitars. I was\nso utterly disappointed \u2013 if it wasn\u2019t\nfor the really rather good lighting\nI would have gone home early and\nthat wasn't to beat the queues for a\nT-shirt.\nAdmittedly the band did warm up\nGet intimate with a band of villains\nThis is my first gig review for Felix, an exciting prospect I believe,\nparticularly as I was going to review The Automatic at the fabulous\nAstoria. But, a last minute change\nmeant I was now going to the curry\nhouse known as Brick Lane to go\nsee Vincent Vincent and the Villains\nat the venue called 93 Feet East. After being told these details, I was\nthen informed that Vincent Vincent\nis possibly the next big thing and\nthat the Venue is really great \u2013 nice\nand small.\nSo off I head to Whitechapel. After\nmany different contradicting directions from a whole gaggle of people\nI finally found my way to Truman\u2019s\nBrewery, which unfortunately is a\nwhole lot bigger than just one build-ing. So I spent 15 minutes walking\naround the vast lots until finally being directed to where I wanted to\ngo.\nI walk in and my first thought is:\ninteresting. There's a BBQ out back\nand a lounge bar with a picnic table courtyard. I was a bit confused\nso I asked some other bystanders\nwho just so happened to be reporters from the University of Suffolk\u2019s\npaper, who were 3 hours late for an\ninterview with the band.\nIt was then time for the gig to\nstart and a friendly bouncer told us\nwe were on the wrong side of the\nbuilding after waiting 30 minutes\nin the courtyard. Inside, the venue\nis very intimate, with a capacity of\nonly between one and two hundred\nwith couches lining the sides and\nno barriers to the stage.\nThe first performance was a very\nlovely girl called Hafdis Huld with\nsweet, simple melodic beats \u2013 perfect for playing while attempting\nto court your date \u2013 touring for her\nMatty Hoban\nMusic Editor\nB\nuenos dias my homeboys and home-girls to\nanother music column.\nSo, music, well, erm,\nyeah I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m\nsure some of it is good and some\nof it is rubbish.\nApologies for a few errors in\nFemm last week, I hope you were\nclever enough to realise the little\nhiccups. Thanks for everyone\u2019s\npositive words about Femm. I am\nresponsible for it so if there is a\nproblem with it then Andy Sykes\ncan just pass the buck to me. So if\nyou have complaints then e-mail\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk and\nI\u2019ll take your abuse like some sort\nof masochistic dart-board.\nOne thing that I have been\nasking various people lately and\nhave been interested in is the effect that downloading music has\non the aesthetic of music. By this\nI mean the sleeve artwork and\nmusic being a cohesive vision\nas a product. This has led to an\nincrease in people purchasing\nvinyl. Music has become slightly\nmore disposable because it has\nbecome more readily available.\nSo more people seem to be reacting to that and buying into an\naesthetic.\nI do love the joy of getting a new\nalbum and popping the CD in the\nplayer and flicking through the\nalbum liner. It makes everything\nfeel like a genuine artistic product\nand not something for consump-tion. Vinyl does just look nice and\nI agree that it sounds better providing you have a good amp.\nHowever, music is not all about\nthe medium and the \u2018product\u2019, it\nis also partly about being able to\n\u2018sell\u2019 yourself through your per-formance. On the stage is where\na band tightens up the screws by\nhammering away at the same\nsongs every night. A record can\nlast for life but a gig is a one-off.\nAn album works outside of time,\nwhereas a show is about the mo-ment. This is why live performances will always be important;\nbands are exposed for what they\nare, they become the human form\nof all those well-produced pits on\nyour CD.\nSo here we have two pages of\nlive reviews for delectation. Go\nout, and love live music. There\nis a Jazz and Rock night tonight\n(Friday 17th) where you can do\nthis. It is free to get in before\n9pm, \u00a33 after. Why don\u2019t you go\nand support live music at your\nuni for free!\nlive reviews\nWe Are Scientists\nBrixton Academy\nby the end of the set, finishing on\ntheir hit, The Great Escape, it was\na bit rousing, but then they did have\nsome guy from the Editors do a\nguest appearance and play the guitar \u2013 the only man on the stage who\ncould that night. The highlight of\nthe evening was them opening with\nsome Celine Dion song, very eight-ies, but sadly the rest just wasn\u2019t\nthat much cop.\nNick Simpson\nWe Are Scientists: The man, the moustache and a lot of pink\nVincent Vincent and the Villains\n93 Feet East\nnew album, Dirty Paper Cups. After interviewing her I still believed\nshe had the most talent out of the\nthree performances that night and\nI discovered she was the Icelandic\nformer Gus Gus singer and has\nalso toured with FC Kahuna.\nThe second set was a four-piece\ncalled The Metros. Who, though\nlacking in talent greatly made up\nfor it with their confidence. They\nwere basically four Londoner kids\ngetting kicks from drinking beer\nand attacking their screaming\ninstruments.\nThe headling act were then on\nand, though, not to my particular\nliking, what with them going with\nthe new fad of keeping there indistinguishable accents and strumming the guitar high up on their\nchests not unlike the Kooks, were\nnever the less quite catchy. The\ndrummer deserves all dues, with\nhim having a hernia operation the\nnext day and still ripping up the\nskins. The act carried on and the\nriffs got louder. After multiple spontaneous on-stage dancing bouts\nby the audience and an exciting\nencore, the show was over and the\ncrowd quickly dispersed.\nOverall I believe that with a band\nthat you like, playing at 93 Feet\nEast; it could be one of the best performances you've ever seen.\nThomas Post\nVincent Vincent and the Villians looking, erm, villainous\nROBIN ANDREWS\n13 Friday 17 November 2006\neviews\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfelix\nR\n\n"

Much in the way the vest\nbecame the vest top; perhaps in the\nfuture, people will walk around in\njust bras. Although probably only\nwomen, not men walking around in\nbras. Though the morbidly obese\nwould be a special case. There\u2019s\nnothing worse than droopy man\nboobs.\nThe modern T-shirt was developed by Jockey International as\ninexpensive athletic wear for the\nUniversity of Southern California\nfootball team. T-shirts have gone\nthe same way as trainers, from\nathletic wear to being worn mainly\nas leisure wear. When the university started stencilling \u201cProperty Of\nUSC\u201d to stop other students stealing the football team\u2019s T-shirts,\nthey ironically became even more\npopular.\nThe T-shirt was also popularised\nby the media coverage of WWII,\nshowing soldiers in their standard\nissue T-shirts. The iconic image of\nJames Dean in a white T-shirt in\nRebel Without a Cause, spawned\na wave of teenagers trying to emulate his style.\nFrom the controversial, T-shirts\nare now accepted as mundane.\nThere are thousands of T-shirt\nbrands, and every big label has a Tshirt with it's logo plastered across\nthe front. It's the ultimate high-margin good for labels. Cheap to\nmake, and a price easily marked up\nto absurd levels just for printing a\nbrand across the front.\nAlthough, there is something\nquite democratic about T-shirts.\nThey can be bought from anywhere\nby everyone, and can easily be\nprinted with anything. Some use Tshirts to express their personality,\nor to substitute for. Or to show support for political beliefs. Who hasn't\nowned a Che T-shirt at some point\nin their life? T-shirts can say a lot\nabout people's beliefs or self image.\nI'm not saying you can judge people by what their T-shirt.

The Clash? Who are they?\nOh wait, I think they were mentioned in Bring It On.\nThe D&G Branded Tee\nThinks wearing D&G across his\nchest is some sort of sartorially\nsuave statement. Also thinks expensive trainers are the epitome\nof style. Wears too much gel in his\nhair. Thinks Chinawhites is a good\nnight out. Will die alone.\nThe Nerdy Internet Purchased Tee\nQuite funny in a sarcastic way.\nSelf-involved and slightly neurotic.\nOwns too many DVDs.

Probably owns a guitar that\nhe doesn\u2019t know how to play.\nThe Vintage Tee\nThinks he is above such things as\nfashion. Aiming for understated\ncool. Ironically, hunting through a\nvintage store for a T-shirt that isn\u2019t\nsweat-stained or reek of sweat is almost the direct opposite of this.\n\n"

Every few years\nit\u2019s the same old story\n- promises that can\u2019t be\nkept, bizarre marketing cam-paigns, and just when you\u2019re\nsure that everything will go\nwrong, it gets released and the\nsame number of people buy it\nagain. Yes, it\u2019s that time in the\nproduct cycle - a new console is\nupon us.\nAnd though it might be a few\nmonths away for us backward\nfools in Europe, America and\nJapan are now receiving their\n(albeit reduced) shipments of\nPlaystation 3s already, and are\nplaying the next stage of Sony\u2019s\ndream. It\u2019s been a long year, but\nfinally the Xbox 360 has a next-gen competitor - the next few\nweeks will be crucial in seeing\nhow the balance shifts, not forgetting the imminent release\nof Nintendo\u2019s most anticipated\nconsole in almost two decades.\nSometimes I wonder who\nactually worries about this\nthough, since the average\ngamer is likely to save up and\npurchase any console he likes\nthe look of (Gender-restricted\ngamer stereotype? Oh no he\ndidn\u2019t!)\nThe Wii looks fantastic, and I\nwant one; the Playstation 3 has\nsecured a good deal of important franchises; and the Xbox\n360 is a curvaceous beauty with\nHalo 3. Who wouldn\u2019t want to\nget a hold of and play all three\nof them? And no, we can\u2019t afford all three of them. And no,\nnor can most. But I wouldn\u2019t\nsay any of us were biting our\nnails at the prospect of there\nonly being two consoles in the\nnext-next-generation race.\nThe fact that a lot of the in-dustry, the media, and half of\nthe blogosphere seem to miss,\nis that gaming is not something\nthat can actually be torn apart\nby something as petty as market forces. If Sony finally pay\nfor taking one risk too many,\nthen SquareEnix and Konami\nwill just move on to other plat-forms. If Bungie suddenly go\nunder, the first-person shooter\ngenre will soldier on without\nthem. Take a glance online and\nyou\u2019ll see the comics, the ma-chinima, and the bedroom coding scene still bubbling over,\nstill continuing to work and develop regardless.\nStill, it\u2019s fun to watch companies throw thousands of pounds\naway on post-modern marketing schemes, before deciding\nto just paint the thing pink and\nre-release it, right?\nMichael Cook\nGames Editor\nThe third time\u2019s the charm\nFelix Games asks if it\u2019s three-in-a-row for Sony, or strike one for the Industry giant\nI remember the Playstation. I\nremember saving up a considerable sum of money and buying one,\naround the time that Final Fantasy\nVII made its debut \u2013 though at the\ntime, the only games I were interested in involved pretty simple plat-forming. The Playstation had been\nout for some time, but the feel of\ngetting a new console is the same\neach and every time. It feels like\nthe future.\nWell, the Playstation 3 has one\nthing in common with that: it is\nthe future for you reading this now.\nSurprisingly for Sony, who were the\nearliest entrant into the last generation (excluding the Dreamcast\nwhich, let\u2019s face it, failed), Europe\nwon\u2019t see the new console until\nMarch 2007. In fact, at the time of\ngoing to press Phil Harrison, Sony\u2019s\ndevelopment chief in Europe, refused to promise even March as a\nconfirmed release date.\nWhatever the fate of Sony\u2019s console in Europe, however, it has hit\nmore distant shores \u2013 and all eyes\nare on the battle between Microsoft\nand the newcomer to see the future\nof console gaming. Why not Wii? Put\nIt runs Blu-Ray. It runs Linux. It runs the internet, wirelessly.

The Wii \u2013 which launches in just\na few weeks time, worldwide \u2013 is a\ncompletely different kind of competitor in the next-gen. For Sony\nand Microsoft, however, the town\nmay finally not be big enough for\nthe two of them. Has the third \u2018Station got what it takes?\n22 felix Friday 17 November 2006\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMichael Cook\nOn the paper In the box\nIt just wouldn\u2019t be a Sony console\nlaunch without very shiny cars, or\nthat girl in lycra.\nThis time, it\u2019s fair to say that\nRidge Racer 7 goes beyond merely\n\u2018shiny\u2019 - the game runs at a solid 60\nframe per second in full high-defini-tion quality. Forget the claim about\n200,000 ways of customising the\ncars, forget the 14-player online option - this game is unbelievable to\nwatch in action. Namco\u2019s reputation for slick, fluid racing remains.\n20 tracks, all playable in reverse\ntoo, and the ability to slash loading\ntimes by installing a chunk of the\ngame onto the PS3\u2019s hard drive.\n\u201cI want to make something where\nyou feel as though you\u2019re in a space\nwhere you\u2019re always connected\nto other players without an online connection,\u201d Hideo Teramoto\ntold Famitsu, the Japanese maga-zine, \u201cIt has a refreshing sense of\nspeed.\u201d\nRefreshing is the word. Ridge\nRacer 7, by the time it hits the UK,\nwill be one of the PS3\u2019s most prominent online racers.\nNext-generation means you need to\nbe seen to do something differently.\nFor the Playstation 3, this means a\nfew things, and most of them could\nbe described as \u2018experimental\u2019.\nDVDs are out. Blu-Ray and HDDVDs are the two competitors for\nthe future of data storage. Microsoft put their money one way, and\nSony went the other. The Blu-Ray\ndisc currently holds 50Gb of data,\nmore than the 15Gb capacity of\nan HD-DVD, but the technology is\nmarkedly more expensive - reportedly costing Sony in the region of\n$100 for each console using one of\nthe drives.\nThe Cell architecture is also\nsomething that Sony pushed when\nselling their console to the media.\nThe technology, which came at a\nhuge price to develop, outstrips\nthe theoretical performance of the\nXbox 360 by double - but the memory differences between the two\nhave led most development companies to declare the consoles more\nor less equal.\nBut what of the third contender -The Wii? Playstation 3 and Xbox 360\nwill compete on raw power alone\nfor the foreseeable future, and it\nlooks like another even battle. But\nthat\u2019s also a huge problem for them\nboth. The controller, the console,\nand even the games released this\nweek all hark back to five years ago.\nThe one thing both consoles seem\nto have forgotten is the one thing\nthe Wii has in droves - change. And\nfunny urine jokes.\nProcessor - 3.2 GHz Cell microproc-essor. The Cell technology was developed with IBM and Toshiba in a\nproject costing around $400million.\nGraphics - NVIDIA G70 256Mb\nGPU.\nInputs - Flash, USB 2.0, Bluetooth\n2.0, GigaBit Ethernet.\nOutputs - HDTV compatible. 7.1\ndigital audio support.\nThings turn nasty at the WalMart PlayStation 3 launch night\nRidge Racer 7\nIn your hand\nThe Sixaxis controller is a wireless\nadaptation of the classic Playstation controller. Its battery life is approximately 40 hours, and though\nsome internet websites claim to\nhave replaced the batteries inside\nthemselves, Sony have promised to\nreplace expired wireless batteries\nfree of charge.\nIn the news\nThe Playstation 3 launch has been\na trial for Sony. Blu-Ray technology\n(see left) was the cause of multiple\ndelays, there was a furore once the\nshelf life of the Sixaxis controller\nwas announced, and the media giant recently came under fire for a\nlegal battle against import website\nLik Sang, which soon forced the site\nto cease trading.\nDespite that, the forecast is for\nPlaystation 3 to bring Sony\u2019s market share to 53% by 2010 - and economists always beat PR execs.\nResistance: The Fall of Man\nGuns and zombies. It\u2019s always\nguns and zombies. And we like guns\nand zombies. Guns, zombies, and\nalternate histories where World\nWar 2 never happened. It\u2019s like the\nplot to every great B-Movie ever,\nrolled into one.\nR:TFoM is a first-person shooter from the creators of the surreal platformer Ratcher & Clank.\nIt\u2019s sci-fi colliding with the creative minds behind one of the most\ntongue-in-cheek adventure games\non the Playstation 2, and it shows.\nThe game is definitely intense, ac-tion-wise, but it also displays a satisfying playability. The weapons,\nwhether they fire bullets that burrow through walls or dual-wielded\npistols that - for the first time - can\nactually be dual-wielded, are incredibly weighty and feel good to\nuse. Not surprising, from the developers that brought us the Suck\nCannon and the Sheep Ray.\nXbox 360 is still waiting for its killer app, asserts IGN, but \u201cPlayStation 3 users get theirs on day one.\u201d\nGenji - DOB\nOr Days Of The Blade, as the\nsubtitle reads. GDOB is a sequel to\nGenji: Dawn of the Samurai, and it\nonce again loosely based on an epic\ntale from Japanese history.\nLoosely being the key word, of\ncourse, since the game quickly became famous for featuring \u201cGiant\nEnemy Crab\u201d as one of its challenging bosses.\nThe camera work might be a bit\noff, and yes, it\u2019s true to question the\nhistorical accuracy of Giant Enemy\nCrab and his weak spot which was\nreputedly able to be \u2018attacked for\nmassive damage!\u2019. But Days of the\nBlade is a healthy replacement for\nthe absent Onimusha, and offers\nsome visually impressive hacking\nand slashing.\nAs with Ridge Racer 7, the game\ncan be partially installed to reduce\nloading times. But even with a large\nhard drive, it\u2019s not clear whether\nmost gamers will want to sacrifice\nup to a quarter of it just to wait a\nlittle less for a level to load.\nGenji won\u2019t break any records, but\nit\u2019s a simple and fun launch title.\n\n"

They\u2019re here for\nthe short haul, probably until the\nnext filming location is discovered.\nI manage to identify the most recently dumped bags easily enough.\nOpening the sacks is less straight-forward. There isn\u2019t time to faff\nabout though; people are likely on\nthe end of a verbal battering from\nthe fiery Irish assistant director.\nProbably runners. Stupidly I don\u2019t\nhave any gloves. Ripping the sacks\nopen appeals to the destructive nature in me, but the satisfaction is\nsoon washed away by the stagnant\ncoffee and fag ash confetti caking\nmy hands.\nCracked polystyrene cups tumble\nacross the car park whilst used serviettes flutter in the air like bacteria\nridden pollen. The contents of three\nor four sacks lay strewn in front of\nthe trailers. Several more will need\nre-bagging. Standing with grimy\narms at my side, moist fingers outstretched and separated, there is no\nsign of the tissue cocoon. A delivery\nman strides past curling his nose\nup. Following him from round the\ncorner, Patrick appears. He quickens towards me, glancing over the\nmess: \u201cOh mate, the teeth were in\nthe bin on stage all along.\u201d\nI\nt was the last day of August\nwhen I got the call. I was lying\nin bed back at home in sleepy\nSuffolk, stroking my beautiful\nwhite cat Pauline and watching Extras, funnily enough, when\nmy mum pushed the door open and\nthrust the telephone in front of my\nface with a puzzled look on her face.\n\u201cHello?\u201d I curiously inquired. \u201cHi\nTom, this is\u2026\u201d I\u2019m terrible for remembering people\u2019s names when\nthey introduce themselves over the\nphone. \u201cI\u2019m location manager for\nClockwork Pictures.

My\nstomach was doing my brain\u2019s work\nfor it \u2013 digesting all the information,\nwhilst trying to figure out who\u2019d actually given me this invitation to the\ncinematic kitchen. Brain engaged, I\nwillingly accepted. \u201cOK, John I\u2019ll\nsee you on Monday\u201d. The voice on\nthe end of the phone corrected me:\n\u201cIt\u2019s Jean, like the French for John\n\u2013 J. E. A. N.\u201d\nI actually started on Saturday,\ntwo days after the phone conversa-tion. Now residing in Earl\u2019s Court,\nJean asked if I could help out setting up before the main shoot began on Monday. I made my way\nto Hammersmith Working Men\u2019s\nClub. Jean met me outside the entrance to the car park of the club.\nDressed in surfer branded casual\ngear, with shades and a half base-ball-half army officer flat cap, we\nshook hands and he walked me to\nlocation. His wispy blonde beard\nand tall beanpole stature led me to\nbelieve he was a pirate.\nThe location was dilapidated to\nsay the least. The car park\u2019s black\ngate was rusted, dried paint shards\nflaking from jutting spears with no\npossibility of swinging shut ever\nagain. Faint parking bay lines boxed\nin rust bucket Fiestas and plumbers\u2019 small car derived vans. Weeds\nstruggled through tarmac cracks\nand the red brickwork crumbled\neasily. A large marquee was being\nconstructed as a base behind the\nscenes alongside an area for make-up, wardrobe, and catering lorries.\nJean led me to the main dancehall\nof the club. Having read the script a\nfew nights beforehand, I could immediately feel the short film being\nplayed out. Bob Geldof becomes\nstranded at a small motel without a\npenny or mobile phone. He sets out\nto find some way of getting to Glasgow where he\u2019s required for a Make\nPoverty History gig.\nInside the hall was a huge empty\nfaux-wooden floor, surrounded by\nsmall seating bays lay in front of\na big stage. The stage instantly\nbrought to mind The Full Monty\ncomplete with a tacky shimmering\nbackdrop of long gold, silver, and\nmagenta ribbons. Each bay housed\na sturdy oak table, a dusty burgundy patterned seating row and blue\nwaiting room chairs; the latter of\nwhich were clearly a new addition\nin such a nostalgic dancehall. There\nwas even a solitary disco ball in the\ncentre of the ceiling, completely\ndwarfed by the scale of everything\nelse. Immediate thoughts conjured\nup images of senior ballroom classes or Punch & Judy shows on stage,\nplaying to children in the audience\nwhilst parents breast fed their toddlers in the bays, twittering about\nhow Big Steve will be released from\nprison in six months.\nI woke up at 6am on Monday and\nmade my way to the location.

    "content": "New clubs wait two months to form\nDelays in organising a new clubs committee has prevented the formation of any new clubs and societies\nRichard Villabos\nA number of prospective clubs are\nbecoming increasingly frustrated\nby the inability of the sabbs to organise a new clubs committee. The\napproval of this committee is required before clubs can start taking\nmembershipmoneyandplanevents\nor trips. There are currently more\nthan 20 club applications awaiting\napproval, some of which have been\nwaiting for almost two months.\nJames Millen, SCC Chair, approached Felix with concerns. Mr\nMillen has been in constant contact\nwith the prospective clubs and their\npossible members, providing them\nwith advice while they await approval from the as yet unformed NCC.\nHaving clubs approved by the NCC\nwas a new measure introduced last\nyear, over concerns that the previous method was unsuitable. Prior\nto the NCC, clubs would go to the\nappropriate CSC chair (ACC, RCC,\nor SCC) and ask to form. The club\ncommittee would meet and vote\non whether to accept the club \u2013 often the SCC would accept the club,\nas no-one wanted to be the one to\ndeny them, whereas the ACC\u2019s often money-hungry clubs would vote\nto reject the club to prevent money\nbeing spread across more clubs.\nThe NCC was supposed to alleviate\nthis partisan nature, and is chaired\nby the Deputy President (Finance\n& Services).\nMr Millen told Felix that the new\nclubs were becoming irritated with\nthe lack of action on the matter, and\nthat he was \u201cfed up with waiting,\u201d\nadding that he was not the only\nCSC who felt this way. Last year,\nthe NCC had no problem meeting,\nand the clubs would be dealt with in\ngroups of 4-6 committee members.\nKirsty Patterson, who is proposing\nthe formation of a Fair Trade Society, told Felix that she was \u201cgetting\nrather angry\u201d at the lack of action,\nand commented that Mr Matthews,\nwho as DPFS will be chairing the\ncommittee, had told her that the\nNCC would meet two weeks ago.\nShe also made the point that her\napplication has been waiting for\nalmost two months, having being\nsubmitted at the start of this term.\nThe matter was raised at Council\nby Mr Millen and others, who questioned the motives behind the delay\nof forming the NCC. It is known that\nneither John Collins (Union President) or Jon Matthews are particularly fond of the NCC, and some at\nCouncil suggested that the delay\nwas an attempt to make the NCC\nlook \u2018faulty\u2019, allowing the two sabbs\nto push approval of clubs back to\nthe CSC chairs, who are opposed to\nsuch a change for the partisanship\nit would bring.\nMr Matthews defended these\naccusations, arguing that referendum business had prevented him\nfrom forming the committee. He\npromised those present that the\ncommittee would meet as soon as\npossible after the announcement of\nthe referendum result. Mr Millen,\nhowever, did not seem convinced.\n\u201c\u2018There\u2019s been no time\u2019 is just an\nexcuse, possibly a valid excuse, but\nnot a reason or a fault in the proc-ess. The new method works.\u201d\nThe RCC Chair, Mark Flower,\nagreed with Mr Millen that the NCC\nworks well, and was again skeptical\nof the reason given for not forming\na new NCC: \u201cI honestly don\u2019t understand why we haven\u2019t been able to\nmeet yet.\u201d He also raised concerns\nover the role of a Deputy President in the chair of the NCC, say-ing: \u201cWhy can\u2019t we meet with a CSC\nchair or FU president in the chair,\ngiven that the Deputy Presidents\ndon\u2019t seem able to provide us with\ntheir time?\u201d\nCommenting over the effect of the\nlong delay on the new clubs them-selves, Mr Flower said: \u201cI don\u2019t rate\ntheir chances at doing well this\nyear. No one is going to be interested in joining new clubs so late in\nthe year.\nWe should have met before term\nstarted.\u201d\nLeft: Jon Matthews, DPFS. Right: the backgammon society is one of the clubs waiting to form\nUK universities invest \u00a315.5m in arms firms\nUK universities hold more than\n\u00a315.5m in shares of arms compa-nies, and University of London colleges significantly contributing to\nthis figure, according to a report released this week by the Campaign\nAgainst Arms Trade (CAAT).\nCAAT asked UK institutions to\ndisclose any holdings they had in\nfirms that produce weapons, and\nspecifically those that have supplied\nweapons to regimes they classify as\noppressive. 45 universities replied\nsaying they held shares in companies such as BAe Systems, Rolls\nRoyce, and Cobham. 33 universities\nrefused to reply, meaning the true\nfigure of arms holdings by UK universities could be even higher.\nThe university that has the largest holdings in arms companies, of\nthose that replied, is University College London, with \u00a31.5m invested in\nthe firms listed by CAAT. Other institutions listed in the top ten were\nKing\u2019s College, with almost \u00a31m\ninvested, and a number of Oxford\nand Cambridge colleges. The University of Manchester, which has\nrecently seen the students\u2019 union\nrefuse to speak to the Vice Chancellor over allegations concerning\narms dealing, invests \u00a3500,000 in\narms companies.\nAlthough Imperial College does\nnot feature in the top ten, requests\nanswered under the Freedom of\nInformation Act (FoI) show that\nthe College has more than \u00a3350,000\ninvested in arms firms, including\nthose on CAAT\u2019s list. These shares\nare not direct holdings of the College, put part of a \u2018pooled fund\u2019\nmanaged by external financial com-panies. The majority of the money\nis invested into the Rolls Royce\nGroup, which has been implicated\nin the selling of arms to countries\nwhere human rights abuses are\ntaking place.\nThe FoI response also shows a\nsmall investment in Halliburton\nof \u00a3250, the company who won a\ncontract to provide rebuilding security in Iraq, and of which Dick\nCheney, Vice President of the USA,\nwas once a director. Halliburton\nhas been heavily criticised by the\nAndy Sykes world press for possible misuse of\nrebuilding money, and nepotism in\nobtaining the contract. FoI requests\nhave also shown that Imperial has\nreceived research grants totalling\nmore than \u00a38.5m from arms manufacturing companies.\nKing\u2019s College, which ranks as the\nsecond biggest investor in London,\nhas faced flack from their student\nbody over the College\u2019s shares.\nLast year, when it was revealed by\nCAAT that the College held a large\nnumber of BAe Systems shares,\nKing\u2019s College London Students\u2019\nUnion (KCLSU) actively lobbied\nthe College to adopt an ethical investment policy. The College subsequently sold its shares, but took\npains to point out that this was a\npurely commercial decision, and\nthat they have no policy against\nholding shares in \u2018defence companies\u2019. The College has also come\nunder fire for holding shares in\nGKN and the Smiths Group, who\nhave sold arms to Libya and noted\nhuman rights abuser Saudi Arabia.\nLSE has drawn ire from its student body for refusing to reveal its\ninvestments, saying that these are\nmanaged in an external \u2018pooled\nfund\u2019 and therefore cannot be ob-tained; however, this has failed to\nwash with LSE Students\u2019 Union,\nas many other universities, including Imperial, invest using the same\nkind of fund, and have been able to\nreveal their investments. The union\nrecently adopted an ethical investment policy, and has resolved to\nlobby the School to do the same.\nLSESU Environment & Ethics Officer, Aled Fisher, speaking to London Student, commented: \u201cTo receive money from companies that\nare responsible for killing innocent\ncivilians and prolonging conflict\nacross the world is unacceptable\nfor a university that prides itself\nas a pioneer of research into social\njustice, human rights and the development of peaceful international\nrelations.\u201d\nThis opposition to London universities holding shares in arms\ncompanies was not confined to\nKing\u2019s College; SOAS, the School\nfor African and Oriental Studies,\nsold its shares after CAAT\u2019s report\nof 2005 mobilised student opinion\nagainst the practice. Goldsmith\u2019s\nCollege has moved away from its\nfund manager, CCLA, which held\narms shares, in order to move to an\nethical investment policy.

    "content": "October brings the beginning of\na new academic year, but more\nimportantly the annual IC Wakeboarding beach party. This year\n53 IC students, with varying board\nriding experience, braved daunting\nweather conditions for a taste of\nthe fastest growing extreme sport\non the planet. For the uninitiated,\nwakeboarding is to water skiing\nwhat snowboarding is to skiing.\nSnowboard regulars will notice the\nsimilarities whilst recognising the\nvery distinct differences.\nThis year\u2019s beach party started in\nvery auspicious style in Beit Quad.\nThunder could be heard whilst rain\nhammered down. Should conditions have stayed as such the entire\nafternoon\u2019s riding would have had\nto be cancelled. Despite the appalling conditions, which were not conducive to wakeboarding, the coach\nwas full to bursting with people eager to get on the water.\nThe coach was bound for JBwaterski, adjacent to Thorpe Park,\nwhere the club rides every Wednesday afternoon. At JB\u2019s the newbies\nwere introduced to the concept of\ncable riding. Cable riding is a new\nconcept in wakeboarding where, instead of being pulled along by a boat,\na cable is suspended in a rectangle\nabove a lake and used to pull riders\nalong the water. To many people\nthis may suggest that is not possible\nto get any \u201cair\u201d as there is no wake\nto launch from; however cable riding has developed into a completely\nnew form of wakeboarding.\nThe first hurdle for our would-be\nwakeboarders was to master the\nart of kneeboarding. Kneeboarding\nis a simple skill, where a person is\nknelt down on a board made of foam\nwhich is then towed behind the ca-ble. Kneeboarding is an essential\nstep in understanding how the cable\nworks and mastering those tricky\ncorners. When a corner is reached\nthe rider must aim to be wide outside the corner to avoid the rope going slack, resulting in a short swim.\nDespite a few early hiccups at both\nthe dock and first corner most IC\nriders completed several circuits\non kneeboards and were ready to\ntry to wakeboard itself.\nStanding up on a wakeboard for\nthe first time can be very challeng-ing, and it normally takes a few\nfaceplants before new riders workout how. The clubs more experienced riders were on hand to offer\ninstruction and handy hints while\nthe new riders waited for their\nWake me up before you go boarding\nYes, maybe they stick together, maybe they sit together in the MDH and\nmaybe the stereotype of Marlboros\nand nice fashionable clothes are not\ncompletely unfair, but I will give the\nGreeks this much: they sure know\nhow to have a hell of a time.\nI showed up at the \u201cAnnual Greek\nparty\u201d on Saturday night in the\nMDH. It took me a lot of effort to get\nthere. OK, so I live in Beit, which is\npractically across the road, so distance was not exactly the limiting\nfactor. Courage though, definitely\nwas. For some reason, I have always\nhad a minor Greekophobia and although I am Greek, born and raised\nin Athens, I only know a handful of\nGreeks at Imperial. It took a bit of\npep-talk to get me to walk out my\nfront door and when I showed up\nhalf an hour late and there were\nonly twenty people there it took\neven more effort to not turn around\nand go home.\nThe night started off with a lovely\nglass of wine and a nice souvlaki.\nSincebothGreeksIknewwereplanning to make a Greek entrance, aka\nmajorly fashionably late, just like\neveryone else planning to attend, I\nstarted talking to a random second\nyear. Maybe not the best start to the\nnight and it got worse when we ran\nout of topics and ended up talking\nabout World War II. Yeah, I know,\nboredom central. At that point I\nwas absolutely ready to leave. But\nthen part two followed.\nThis made the previous suffering\nworth it. It was all about the mu-sic, the dancing and having a great\ntime. The music ranged from Sean\nPaul to all-time Greek favorites.\nBeing half-Greek and having been\nto an international high school I\nsometimes feel I cannot quite relate to people from home. However,\nwhen the music started playing\nthat completely changed. Everyone\nwas so friendly and approachable\nthat I put my old phobias behind\nme and decided to give everyone\na second chance. It was definitely\nworth it. I was impressed by the\nmusic, the dancing, the sense of\nrhythm and also the culture. For\nthose that think Greek partying is\nabout smashing plates, they should\nattend some future events to clear\nup that misconception.\nThe crowd was multi-cultural\nTimidly venturing out with her fellow Greeks\nSamuel Murphy\nNewbies and experienced riders get the chance to board together at IC Wakeboarding\u2019s beach party\nturn. There were many false starts\nas riders failed to get up and away;\nhowever, loud cheers went up whenever a new rider managed to stand\nup and stay up. The atmosphere at\nthe dock was amazing as more people managed to find their way up.\nOnce up, many people failed to negotiate the first corner. Despite this\ntheir first experience of riding had\nthem hooked and they couldn\u2019t wait\nto try again. By the end of the day\nmost new riders had managed to\nstand up and many had progressed\nenough to manage a complete cir-cuit, which is impressive for a first\nday. Whilst waiting their turn the\nnewbies were treated to an awesome display of riding by a number\nof local pros who laid down some\nhuge inverted tricks, predominantly from flat water. Huge \u201cair\u201d can be\nachieved from a technique known\nas \u201cloading the line\u201d. This works as\nthe cable is suspended high above\nthe water; by going onto a hard heel\nedge the rider can build tension in\nthe line which when released pulls\nthe rider into the air.\nAs the days riding drew to a close\nthe smell of barbequed food drifted\ntowards the dock, which tempted\nmany tired riders to call it a day.\nThere was a small number of hardcore riders who simply refused to\nstop riding and managed to miss\nall the food.

    "content": "I\nmperial College played\nhost to Lord Robert Winston in a lecture organized by the chaplaincy. The\nlecture, entitled \u2018Playing\nGod,\u2019 explored the relationship between science\nand religion from Lord Winston\u2019s\nperspective. Its aim was to stimulate further reflection on the matter\nand encourage further discourse.\nLord Winston\u2019s talk took us on\na fascinating historical journey,\nbeginning with Pieter Brueghel\u2019s\n1563 painting The Tower of Babel.\nDepicting the construction of the\ntower, the painting is believed to be\na comment on mankind\u2019s failed attempt to be like God. Winston used\nthis painting as the starting point\nfor his first question of the evening,\n\u201cDo we have so much information\nthat we do not need God?\u201d\nWinston argued that, whether\nwe are spiritual or not, history has\nshown a strong desire for spiritu-alism. He presented photographs\nof stenciled hand outlines in the\nPyrenean Grotte de Gaga. These\ndark, damp, inhabitable caves are\nsaid to be mankind\u2019s first cathe-drals. Around 250 hands are painted there, many of them with missing fingers. These missing fingers\nwere initially believed to be caused\nby mutilation, either due to ritual\nor the cold of the Ice Age. However, skeletons found nearby the\ncaves and in the surrounding area\nshow no evidence of digits miss-ing. Therefore, it is believed that\nthe hands were stenciled with the\nfingers deliberately curled, similar\nto hunting signals, in an attempt to\nreach the transcendental through\nthe walls of the caves. In a similar\nvein, Winston considered Stonehenge: the passion, dedication and\nsacrifice required in moving those\nmonumental stones. Drawing also\non Christianity (the thousands of\npeople, some of them non-spir-itual, who turned up to see Pope\nJohn Paul II last Easter) and Islam (the painstakingly exquisite\ndesigns of their temples), Winston\nconcluded that mankind has made\nnumerous attempts to reach the\ntranscendental.\nNext, Winston explored the sci-entific, asking whether there is a\ngenetic tendency towards spiritu-ality. Much experimental work has\nbeen carried out on human spiritu-ality, given that all cultures display\nit in one form or another. Dr Dean\nHamer, a geneticist and author\nof the book The God Gene: How\nFaith Is Hardwired into Our Genes\nfound that there are particular\nconfigurations of a dopamine-like\nneuro-transmitter in spiritual peo-ple. Tom Bouchard, a psychologist,\ntraced twins who had been separated at birth and compared monozygotic and dizygotic twins. He found\nthat, irrespective of environment,\nmonozygotic twins showed similar\nattitudes in intrinsic religiousity.\nBoth studies seem to indicate that\nin many cases there is a genetic\npredisposition to spirituality and we\nare hard-wired to search for something deeper and transcendental.\nThere is also evidence that spirituality may have helped humanity.\nFor example, in general, the people\nwho survived Auschwitz were those\nwho displayed some form of spiritu-ality. Winston did not provide much\nevidence for this, but used the story\nof Auschwitz-survivor Viktor Frankl\nto help illustrate his point. Frankl\nfound spirituality to be a comfort\nto him throughout his troubles,\nand experienced three modes of\nthought during his ordeal. The first\nwas sheer terror and disbelief, the\nsecond was a survival-of-the-fittest\ntype mentality, and the third was a\nbelief that there was someone (be it\na deity or a deceased family mem-ber) looking down on them; a belief\nthat they shouldn\u2019t lose hope.\nA\nfter an exhilarat-ing, occasionally disjointed\njourney, Winston\nmoved onto the\ncore of his talk;\nthenotionof\u2018playing God\u2019. He asked whether one can\nview the human embryo as a human\nbeing and discussed Nicholas Hartsoeker, who examined seminal fluid\nunder a microscope and believed\nhe could see a tiny man within each\nsperm. This discovery led Rabbi\nPinhar Elijah bon Meir to state that\nwasted sperm is like murder. Winston points out that, whilst the ethics behind this are sound, they are\nwrong as we now know that there is\nno person inside sperm. This shows\nthat our ethics can only be as good\nas our knowledge (in this case sci-entific). The two go hand-in-hand,\nso it is impossible to ignore the\nscience. For this reason, Winston\ndisagrees with the Catholic view\nthat life begins at conception. For a\nbiologist, there is no conception \u2013 it\nis a continuation. Take for example\nthe mouse that was pathogenically\ninduced in Japan. In that particular\ncase, conception never took place,\nyet life was produced.\nFor the final part of his talk, Winston addressed the use of gene modification to eradicate diseases. Winston discussed his own work, which\ninvolves inserting gene constructs\ninto the testes of a baby mouse, and\nasked why we shouldn\u2019t use methods such as this in humans to enhance their quality of life. Consider\nthe plight of Sardinia where every\nsixth inhabitant carries the beta-thalassemia gene. Surely we should\ndo all we can to eradicate this gene\nfrom future generations. But this is\nplaying God \u2013 and is it right?\nWinston himself believes that\nthere is nothing wrong with playing God. In fact, it is \u201cdesirable\u201d as\nwe use what we\u2019ve been given to\npromote life. However, the problem\narises when we try to supplant God.\nAdditionally, the consequences of\nenhancing humans are not certain\n\u2013 we do not understand the full ef-fects. In Winston\u2019s view, \u201cMan may\nbe unique, but he is insignificant.\u201d\nLike it or not, there are things that\ncannot be explained, for example,\nthe Boxing Day tsunami, and it\nbothers Winston when scientists\nthink they have all the answers.\nCertainly, we cannot prove the\nexistence of God \u2013 but nor can we\nprove the non-existence of God. In\nWinston\u2019s view, phrases such as\n\u201cGod delusion\u201d are dangerous and\ndo not promote social cohesion,\nwhereas religion itself has been\nshown to be a cohesive force in so-ciety. Throughout the talk, Winston\ndisapproved of Richard Dawkins\u2019\nfundamentalist denigration of people having religious beliefs, which\nhe believes to be an attitude unhealthy for society.\nLord Winston\u2019s final point was\nthat science and religion are both\nabout uncertainty \u2013 both are at\ntheir most dangerous when they\nbecome certain.\nOne disappointment for me in\nRobert Winston and playing God\nImperial\u2019s most famous \u2018celebrity scientist\u2019 speaks about the age-old conflict between science and religion\nparticular was that the talk didn\u2019t\nreally explore the ways in which a\nscientist can incorporate their faith\ninto their work or indeed whether\nWinston thought this was possible.\nWhile it is known that Lord Winston\nhas a deep, long-held interest in\nJudaism, he, perhaps wisely, chose\nto keep the details of his religious\nstance private, insisting that it is\npersonal (much to the chagrin of\nthe gentleman seated behind me).\nAdditionally, the talk merely highlighted the uncertainty of science\nand religion (and the need for mutual respect between the two), and,\nin contrast to my prior expectations,\ndid not bring anything particularly\nprovocative to the table.\nHowever, it was made clear at\nthe beginning that this was not\nthe aim of the talk. The aim was\nto simulate further discourse and,\njudging by the questions at the\nend, this was achieved. Overall,\nI found Lord Winston\u2019s talk to be\nenjoyable and thought-provoking.\nHe drew on interesting historical\naspects to illustrate his points and\nthe overall result was a measured\nand thoughtful take on the science-religion relationship.\nNaomi Antony\nWhile most of Robert Winston\u2019s speech was a thoughtful overview of the science/religion conflict, he still had time for a little disco dancing\n7\nfelix\nFriday 17 November 2006\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nEMERSON\nVIGOUREUX\n\n"
