    "content": "Recreational\nClubs The past year has gone surprisingly well for RCC\nwith most clubs running smoothly and efficiently.\nThe start of the year saw an excellent Freshers' Fair\nwith large numbers of clubs substantially increasing\ntheir membership figures. In particular Wine\nTasting and Real Ale Societies have done very well\nin keeping their clubs active and thriving after\nhaving their grants drastically chopped by last years\nUFC. Competition-wise two clubs have been\noutstanding. Wine Tasting for winning the InterUniversity Wine Tasting Competition for the third\nyear running and Dance Club who seem to have\nhad a top three placing in almost every competition\nthey have entered. The Union outdoor clubs have\nalso maintained their popularity and excellence. The\ncommitment given to these clubs by members is\nenormous, culminating in three expeditions this\nsummer, the Underwater Club to Egypt and the\nMountaineers and S&G are both off to the\nKarakoram mountain range in Pakistan.\nUFC this year has run extremely well due to a good degree of cooperation between its members\nand Jackie Peirce. and possibly a large carry over\nfrom last year.\nDave Grimshaw\nSCAB Once again the past year has seen significant growth\nin the Board's activities, achieved by both the\nefforts of existing constituent clubs and the starting\nup of a previously inactive club. It has, however,\nalso seen its share of problems.\nThe Chamber Music Society has risen to its\nhighest level of activity yet, providing opportunities\nfor musicians within College to play in small\ngroups. Some participated in the two concerts held\nlast term, both of which were successful. The\nsociety provides a valuable addition to musical\nactivity within IC.\nThe Choir has maintained its activity over the\nprevious year with the performances of popular\nworks at Christmas and Easter being well-attended.\nUse was also made of the organ in the Great Hall,\nwhich adds to the range of perform able works.\nThe Debating Society has broadened its activities,\nmaintaining a higher profile than previously.\nDebates within College involving joint events with\nother societies have led to improved audiences, and\ndebates outside College have also been attended\nwith a succesful end to the year being provided by\nwinning the 150th Anniversary of London\nUniversity Competition.\nThe Dramatic Society have had another successful\nyear, with not only the two major productions, but\nalso a lunchtime production in the spring term,\ngoing well. Participation in the London Student\nDrama Festival was a major success, as was the\n1986 Edinburgh tour. Both the theatre venue\n(Theatre West End) and the performing side (Beit\nTheatre) were extremely professionally organised\nand run, with there again being few problems.\nThe Jazz and Rock Club has continued to grow\ndespite early problems with the reliability of\nequipment. Many bands have been formed which\nrehearse and perform at parties and concerts both\nwithin College and around London.\nThe Operatic Society has maintained the level of\nprevious years activities with a successful and well-attended February show; as well as small\nproductions taking place at other times of the year.\nHaving had little contact with the organisers of last\nyears self-financing summer tour I can only assume\nthere were no problems and it was as successful\nas in the past.\nThe Orchestra has had another successful year,\nperforming difficult works as well in both their\nChristmas and Easter concerts.\nAs well as the above activities all the SCAB\nsocieties took part in SCAB NITE which was the\nmost successful of recent years, and raised over\n\u00a3200 for Rag. This event must not be regarded by\nSCAB societies solely as a fund-raising event: it\nprovides an ideal opportunity for clubs to increase\nthe level of awareness of their activities within\nCollege. This year, the fact that other events\ndirectly clashed with SCAB Nite was extremely\nannoying to both organisers and performers alike.\nThe most significant thing to happen this year\nhas been the re-emergence of the Film Society.\nShowing a film every week the Society has\nflourished this year, and promises to provide a significant addition to the variety of entertainments\noffered to students at IC. Congratulations to those\ninvolved.\nWith the theft of a mixer for the SCAB projectors\nlast summer, the new SCAB PA has been heavily\nused both with and without projectors. The\ninterdependence of the two systems has sometimes\ncaused problems, which will (hopefully) be rectified\nnext year. With FilmSoc re-assuming control of the\nprojectors, the amount of time spent administering\nthese facilities will be reduced to a reasonable level.\nThe problems with the SCAB finances\nexperienced over recent years have unfortunately\ncontinued. At the beginning of the year, a discrepancy between the Union grant allocated and\nthat expected was eventually attributed to an\nunexplained change made by last year's Deputy\nPresident. The mistakes made in the auditing of the\nSCAB books for 1983/84 again caused errors to\nbe made in the calculation of the end-of-year\nreturnable balance for last year. This is the third\nyear this has happened and causes much\nunnecessary work on behalf of both SCAB and the\nCollege internal auditor. My thanks to Charlie\nEagle for his considerable help in sorting out this\nyear's problems. It should not be necessary for\nstudents to have to check the work of College's finance section, but as has been illustrated over the\npast few years, this is not the case. The problems\nwhich emerged last year concerning the distribution\nof College funds to Choir and Orchestra appear to\nhave been resolved satisfactorily at the end of last\nyear, and have not recurred this year.\nIC Music Committee has continued to devote\ntime to the special problems faced by the musical\nsocieties within College; with discussions ranging\nfrom immediate problems (eg the shortage of\npractice pianos within College) to anticipated future\nones (eg the expected loss of facilities in 53 Princes\nGate). The work of the committee has been to the\nbenefit of all musicians in College, and has been\npleasingly more coherent than I was led to expect.\nFinally, my thanks to all the members of the\nBoard who have made this year such a success: to\nDr Don Monro for agreeing to continue as\nOrchestra Staff Treasurer; to Dr Alan Sherlton; and\nthe SCAB Executive. Also especially to the Board's Senior Treasurer, Professor Bill Wakeham whose\nsignature, after years of practice is slowly becoming\nmore legible, though a few more years are still\nrequired for perfection! Also to Louise, and anyone\nelse who has had to put up with me in my less\ndynamic moments...thanks.\nAcademic Affairs Officer\nTo avoid tedium and verbosity I shall simply make\na few points about this year's innovations on the\nacademic front and some feelings and advice that\nI have. Those I can remember are as follows:-1. Dep Reps\nThe idea of trying to keep some check on Dep\nRep performance was squashed at Council on\n16.2.87. However the AAC meeting on 2.3.87 felt\nthat the idea was a good one and would be worth\nfollowing up in future years if it could be done\naccurately and from the beginning of the year.\n2. Admissions Issue\nThe Student Recruitment Advisory Panel was set\nup by the Rector to generate policy and advise on\nrecruitment issues. Its discussions are more\nphilosophical, rather less statistical, than admissions\npolicy, or such is one's initial impression. It would\nappear to be a useful 'think tank'.\nThe new scholarship scheme is to be operated\nagain this year. It seemed to have been a success\ninitially despite the adverse conditions.\n3. Feelings/Advice\nIt saddened me that Board of Studies can\nwholeheartedly approve a document with statements\nsuch as \"has gone to considerable lengths...to\nexpose the proposals to outside scrutiny\" when all\nstudent criticism was ignored, largely because the\ndocument was already approved. I would like to\nthink, after a year of involvement with course\nrevisions, that in future anyone who is concerned\nenough to formulate thoughts on their course should\nbring these forward to someone as high as possible\nin the Union structure as soon as possible.\nExperience shows that if a well thought out case,\nwhich can be shown to have student support, is put\nto 'College', then 'College' often will listen. This\nis what future Union officers must realise. However\nthey must also realise that an individual can easily\nbe shot to pieces, especially academically by a hawkish Department.\nDave Lowrie\nInternal\nServices\nOfficer\nQT\nIt was a pity that such a popular and useful service\nproved to be so controversial. It was however\npleasing to note that the popular success of last\nterm's boycott showed once more that the student\npopulation is not prepared to allow College to ride\nroughshod over their long term interests. I can only\nhope that the more positive attitude to the whole\nJCR issue which appears to have resulted will\neventually lead to a more generally acceptable\nsolution.\nAnnual Reports 10\n\n"

    "content": "Letters. FELIX, Friday May 15th1987 Imperial Gay\nnot OK\nDear Dave,\nFELIX has been a forum for much\ndiscussion on the subject of\nhomosexuality recently. With the\nexception of a rather coy and\ndefensive letter written from a Christian standpoint, no objections\nhave been publicly raised to the\ncommitment of Union resources to\nlesbian and 'gay' welfare. Yet such\nobjections can be presumed to exist\nwithin Imperial; why else the long\ndelay in instituting measures that have\nbeen commonplace in other colleges\nfor years? A section of one of your\nrecent editorials, subtitled \"Gay\nNews Blues\", finally prompted me to\ncontribute my own thoughts on the\nsubject.\nSociety in the 1980's is\ntechnologically and economically the\nmost sophisticated that the world has\never know, but it still has a surprising\namount in common with earlier\ncivilisations. Historically, all\ncommunities have developed and\ngrown through the tutelage of their\nyoung in the ways of society. Thus\nthey, and their subsequent progeny,\ncan build on the current\nachievements. This education is\nimplemented partly through the\nformal education system, but most\nfundamentally through the parent-child relationship. In this way, the\nexternal aspects of an economy can\ndevelop and grow enormously, while\nthe basic aspects of people's lives\nremain very similar. The family unit\nas a social building block is not\ncultural propaganda circulated by the\npresent government (or indeed Queen\nVictoria), but empirical fact, in all the\ngreat societies the world has known,\nlike it or not, these are cultural norms\nwe live by.\nIn the light of this discussion, the\nnature of sexual relationships in\nsociety can be seen to be of great\nimportance to its development. That\na stable enough relationship between\nand man and a woman can be built\nup to allow the intellectual, emotional\nand social development of their\nchildren is a real need societies have.\nIt follows that, within such a society,\ncertain types of behaviour are\naberrant; amongst these are rape,\nindiscriminate sexual intercourse, and\nhomosexuality. All three examples\nhave been present in our society, to\na greater or lesser degree, since its\ninception. In the past, they have been\nregarded as outside normal or\napproved behaviour. It now appears\nthat certain segments of society wish\nto establish at least the latter two\npractices as acceptable.\nWhy might this be? A logical\nexplanation defeats me. Not only is\nhomosexuality a socially useless, even\ndestructive, activity; it is also most\nunappealing aesthetically. Its\nprincipal act of consummation is a scatological parody of sexual\nintercourse, rejecting all aspects of a sexual relationship except the purely\ntactile. The feeling of revulsion this\nengenders, when coupled with sexual\nimmaturity and a profound lack of\nintelligence, results in the activity of\n'queer bashing', which seems to rise\nin proportion to the social acceptance\nof homosexuality in other quarters.\nPerhaps those who have not yet\nresolved their adolescent\ndisagreements with their parents see\nthis as a symptom of social\noppression; the reality is simply a lack\nof social acceptance, for some people,\nthe mere scent of an an oppressed\nminority in need is enough to bring\nout the banners and petitions.\nThese are the reasons why I reject\nthe arguments you propose in your\neditorials in favour of 'gay' rights.\nWhen you state that human sexual\nfeelings are more complicated than a desire to penetrate other peoples'\nbodies, you are correct. The\ncomplexity is added by the desire to\nextend an emotional relationship\nphysically, the desire to demonstrate\nthe depth of your affection, the desire\nto create new life. A desire to be\npenetrated yourself adds no\ncomplexity, merely some variety to\npointless hedonism. If we are to be\nidealists, as all good students should,\nwe should strive for a society in which\nhomosexuals could be shown\ncompassion, be allowed to get on with\ntheir lives, and be protected from\nmindless violence. A society where\nhomosexuality is institutional is ed is\nnot ideal. It is a contradiction, and one\nI want no part of. We still have the\nopportunity to prevent this happening\nat IC Union. I have neither the time\nnor the energy to organise any\nconcerted effort to achieve this. Any\nstudent who feels empathy with this\naim can show it by writing to FELIX,\nand by making sure it is an important\nissue for the presidential elections.\nAndrew Thomis, Elec Eng IV\nConfusion and\ncorruption\nDear Dave,\nFollowing the recent requests in\nFELIX for correspondence on the\n'gay rights' issue I wonder if I can\nmake some comments.\nI think it is fair to say that in any\nargument over 'right and wrong' most\nprotagonists are accepting some form\nof objective morality; that there are\nright or best attitudes to the way we\nshould live and that confusion and\ncorruption have entered into some\npeoples lives who have got it wrong.\nIt is no doubt true, I think we can say,\nthat our world does harbour much\ncorruption. However convinced,\nthen, a particular person is that he is\nin the right I think it would take a rather naive or arrogant person to\nclaim that, in all areas of their life,\nthey are completely unaffected by\nsuch confusion, especially with regard\nto 'gut' reactions.\nDiscussions over right uses of\nhuman sexuality do most often, I think, strongly acknowledge that it is\na valuable thing, and not least those\nin FELDC. We hear of the hurt caused\nto homosexuals by them sometimes\nbeing automatically regarded as\npromiscuous, of Robert Daniel's sadness caused by seeing\nheterosexuality being reduced to just\n'sleeping with a member of the\nopposite sex\" (March 6th) and of\nAndrew Bannister's encouragement\nto people holding some views on the\nuse of sex to undergo deep\n'questioning (of) their attitudes\"\n(May 8th). People on both sides, then, of the\n'gay rights' debate can definitely start\nfrom common ground; that there are\nrights and wrongs on this issue. Some\npeople have got it wrong. Confusion\nand corruption have indeed entered\ninto this area also (and caused much\nconflict). Let us clearly acknowledge\nthey have and that means especially\nwith regard to people's gut reactions,\neven, and yes especially, with regard\nto sexual desires (as per the quoted\npoints above). It would seem to me,\nthen, to not be helpful for the idea\n(even if it be a fact) that a significant\nproportion of adolescent males\nexperience sexual feelings towards\nother men to be treated as a significant\nreason for supporting\n\"progress...made on the gay rights\nfront\" (Editorial May 1st) without\nexplaining why such feelings must be\nregarded as being in line with right,\nuncorrupted attitudes to life.\nI for one would prefer to hear less\nof claims about subjective feelings (or\nindeed of the cries of \"homophobia\")\nand for the discussion to turn more\nonto tackling the question: What is the\nright relationship between sex and\nlove?\nYours sincerely,\nHugh MacKenzie, Civ Eng RA.\nInsensitive and\ncynical\nDear Dave,\nI was quite looking forward to the\ngossip column about Silwood, which\nwas bound to be written.\nWhen it finally appeared, I was\nfurious to find that the very serious\nand beautiful intention of Steph and\nMark to get married was more or less\nlaughed at.\nCould you please name the idiot\nwho said that the odds against the\nmarriage were 5:1 so I can skin\nhim/her alive! Of all the insensitive,\ncynical and destructive things to say,\nthis has to be one of the nastiest feats\nof backbiting possible.\nSteph and Mark were s lagged off\neven before they started going out\nwith each other, so I suggest you guys\nstart leaving them alone.\nAnyway, I'd like to congratulate\nthem both again and wish them all the\nhappiness in the world. Don't let\nthings get you down, Steph!\nLove, Ina El-Kadhi\nObjective\nmorality\nDear Dave,\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but I was\nunder the impression that FELIX was\na student newspaper. If this is indeed\nso, could you please enlighten me as\nto why such articles as \"Censored\"\nwhich appeared in last week's FELIX\nare given space in which to slag off\nmembers of the College. I refer, of\ncourse, to the part about Mark and\nmyself and our engagement.\nTo my way of thinking an\nannouncement of this kind should be\na happy occasion not only for the two\npeople involved, but for the people\nthat know them, and can share in their\nhappiness and good fortune. Why\ndoes it have to be different for us?\nTrue, we have not been together for\nvery long but if we feel its the right\ndecision, what right have people who\nhardly know us to slag us off for it.\nI know that I would not take such a large step unless I was sure and I'm sure Mark will agree with me.\nWhen we decided to get engaged it\nwas a a prelude to marriage (which\nis incident ly, the definition of\nengagement). It doesn't matter\nwhether the decision comes after 4\nyears or 4 months of a relationship;\nit is still the most important and\nserious step anyone can take in their\nlives. We certainly didn't take the\ndecision li ghd y by any means, so who\nthe hell does the writer think he/she\nis by saying \"undisclosed sources\nwould lay 5:1 against a marriage ever\ntaking place\".\nWhen Kathy Tait and John Ingham\ngot engaged, everyone was full of\ncongratulations for them (including\nFELIX). I can't see any difference,\nso why can anyone else.\nI'm sure, Dave, that if you and\nJudith were in the same position, you\nwould be angered and upset about\nsuch comments and would not dream\nof allowing such crap to be printed.\nWe both feel that we have been\nvictimised and I don't see why we\nshould have to suffer it. I hope that\nwhen the person who wrote the article\nfinds out how upset we are he/she will\nreveal him/herself and apologise\npublicly.\nYours sincerely,\nStephanie Snell, Physics I "

    "content": "e. MSCs\nMSCs are well run and well orchestrated by their\nrespective execs. I unfortunately, haven't been to\nall of these but those I have attended, have gone\nthrough quickly and without a hitch. This I feel is\ntheir main problem, nobody questioned the\noutgoing of money in supplement aries. Whether\nthis is because of a fear of tit for tat reprisal against\ntheir club's chairman or not, I don't know, but I feel this is the only useful purpose the sabbaticals\nmake on MSCs beside making sure nothing illegal\nis perpetrated.\n5 College Committees\na Refectory Users and Catering and Conference\nIn Refectory Users Committee we have discussed\nthe renovation of Southside Refectory, and I bring\nup any suggestions and complaints, which unless\nthey are signed and dated are ignored, and even\nif they are, seem to be ignored too.\nThe QT/JCR argument was brought up here too\nbut no agreement could be reached, as everyone\nwas too deeply entrenched on their respective sides,\nso this committee can make decisions only if\neverybody is on the same side, but isn't too good\notherwise.\nb. Safety Council\nSafety Council is made up of Union subcommittees that keep an eye on all aspects of\nCollege safety eg radiation, HSE, biological\nhazards, chemical hazards etc. Over the next 2\nyears each of these committees will be scrutinised\nin detail by Safety Council and suggestions for\nimprovements made.\nOn the bad side due to lack of money or other\nreasons, safety matters only seem to be acted upon\nwhen inspectors say it is dangerous eg at Silwood\na fire escape was said to be against fire regulations\nand it was likely the next fire inspection would\ndemand an alteration. As the problem had already\nbeen identified, why couldn't we act now instead\nof waiting? I just hope there isn'ta fire between\nnow and the next inspection, for the sake of those\nworking or living in that area, and for those who\nwent against my suggestion.\nc. Parking and Traffic\nThis committee is to control all roads and parking\nspaces on College property. The Linstead\nmotorbike park is now reopened and the parking\nspaces outside the barriers on the opposite side of\nthe road from the Post Office are as inaccessible\nas ever but Mr Reeves still gives them to the Union.\nThe two barrier guards and the Southside warden\nare beginning to bite and have cleared up some\ncongestion and illegal parking, and for this I thank\nthem and back them up fully.\nd.F and E/ Governing Body\nA lot of the committee decisions are passed\nthrough here, unless one of the small minority of\nnon-academic voices objects to any issue. The real\nfault with this committee however is there is not\ncomplete representation on it, so the views of\nacademics and admin are more than adequately\nheard, but not those of other workers in the College\nwithout whom we would die. We sabbaticals do\nbring up points eg paper on the sports hall, the jobs\nreduction, increased overseas intake, FELIX's Civil\nEngineering letter, AIDS and other issues that\notherwise wouldn't be known, but I feel really free\ndiscussion is hampered by a tendency to stick to\nthe rigid finishing time of 1.00pm so dinner doesn't get cold.\n6 Other Jobs\na. Parking Permits\nThese were given out by a committee to nearly\nall who applied and appealed, and more were\nreturned to be re-distributed. This subject still\nappears to cause more anguish and consternation\nto people who really shouldn't even be applying,\nso my advice to Chas is to ignore these people.\nb. QT Boycott\nThere were two points to this boycott that\ncontinued to concern me:\n(i) The decision to boycott came from the floor\nof the largest UGM I 've seen after a discussion with\nthe Rector and J Smith by a very considerable\nmajority vote, and still people believe that the\ndecision was undemocratic. As a point of\ninformation the last government was elected on a minority vote but we all have to obey that decision,\nso the ranting s of some people confused me.\n(ii) The inability of people to walk 2 minutes in\nanother direction to get alternative food and assist\ntheir Union to make a democratic point (and I fear\nif alternative food had not been available more\nwould have crossed the picket). Even the most\ncommon excuse: \"I didn't know about the boycott\"\nrankled after 2 days of boycott with the same people\ncrossing. My only conclusion to this is students are\neither severely overworked or really bloody idle,\nlazy buggers, who don't give as... about anything\nbut themselves.\nc. Elections\nThese have run reasonably smoothly except for\nthe presidential election and the 'abstain' campaign.\nWhile this did raise some important points I feel\nthat they were mis-timed in making law and the\ncampaign was instigated on the grounds of personal\nfeelings, rather than on principal ie they didn't like\nthe idea of one or more of the candidates being\nelected because of personal dislike, and were in a position to do something about it.\nIt is the duty of elections committee to act on the\nconclusions of an election and its running after the\nelection (unless a rule is breached) and not change\nthe terms of running half way through.\nConclusions\nI have enjoyed the year as Hon Sec and extended\nlife as a student, and I hope I haven't put my foot\nin it too much. I don't think I have made great\nadvances in the Union, but I hope I have made a small advance in some of the fields I'm involved\nin and I feel my work could save the Union money\nin the long run. I hope that what I 've said hasn't all been dismissed in committees, and after the\nlaughter dies down a point will have been made\nbecause I 've not said anything I didn't believe to\nbe true or right or useful in directing actions, and\nhave tried to implement some of my views myself.\nThank you and goodbye.\nCredits\nThis year would have driven me mad and all my\nhair would have gone had it not been for some\nunbelievable work by Jen, Pat and Kathy all of\nwhom have helped and kept me going when\nsometimes all I wanted to say was 'f... it' and lock\nmy door.\nMy last thanks must go to Christine and Jackie.\nWhen we started people said we wouldn't get on\nand nothing would get done, especially me and\nChristine. Nothing however could be further from\nthe truth and although we have disagreed on some\npoints, all three of us have got on well and I hope\nended as friends. I wish them and the office\npermanent staff the best of everything for the future.\nDave Colley\nAthletics Clubs\nChairman Since affiliating to the Universities Athletic Union\n(UAU) in 1984, the overall competitive level of\nsport at IC has improved markedly. This year, there\nhave (so far) been four outstanding successes in the\nUAU competitions.\nThe men's volleyball squad reached the final\ntournament at Essex, eventually coming sixth. Five\nof the team represented the University of London\n(UL) side at the British Universities Sports\nFederation (BUSF) championships.\nFor the third year in a row the men's water polo team (coached by Cliff Spooner, the Sports Centre\nManager) reached the finals and came fourth in a very close, hard fought tournament.\nOnce more the ladies' badminton VI reached the\nfinal of the competition, only to be beaten by\nSheffield. Further, the first pair won the individual\nladies' doubles title and represented English\nuniversities at the BUSF tournament.\nThe Boat Club became the first university side\nto win three events in the UAU championships, with\nthe men's first, second and novice VIIIs winning\ntrophies on the same day. Ninth position (out of\nover 400 starters) in the Head of the River Race\n(HORR) meant that they were the third fastest\nBritish Club crew. One of the Club won the HORR\nsingle sculls event beating several international\noarsmen in the process.\nOff the field, too, there have been some\nsignificant developments over the past year. The\n'divisional reorganisation' of the UAU has been\napproved and will be implemented from next\nOctober. This means that there will be six teams\nin our group, resulting in one extra game for each\nteam. Also, the UAU General Committee voted to\npay for winners' plaques and medals centrally,\nallowing them to be presented after the final\nmatches.\nWithin College there has been much debate over\nthe standard of indoor sports facilities on campus.\nThis matter was brought to the attention of the\ngovernors who appointed a sports hall working\nparty. This group (of which the ACC Chairman and\nICU President are members) was instructed to carry\nout a feasibility study on the building of an\nOlympic-size sports hall on campus. Much progress\nhas already been made in this direction, but some\nhard work still lies ahead.\nAnother long term project that is being actively\npursued is the laying of an astroturf hockey pitch\nat Harlington. The gravel extraction is expected to\ntake five years under a 'rolling-plan', which gives\nus the timescale of this project. It has been\nsuggested that an astroturf pitch would not only\nprovide the perfect surface for hockey, but also\nproduce a large income from external bookings.\nThis money could then be used to finance student\nsport throughout College.\nThis year has seen the birth of Fives at College,\nwith a new Rugby Fives section of Squash Club.\nTwo of the old courts by the Linstead tennis courts\nhave been revamped and several fixtures have been\nplayed.\nFinally, I would like to thank this year's Exec\nfor all their hard work, and remind club captains\nto encourage people to stand in the coming\nelections. It is in your own interest!\nRob Kelly\nAnnual Reports 8\n\n"

    "content": "Finance\nThe Union Finance Committee is the committee\nI have found most difficult to organise this year.\nThe large number of claims dealt with, some\nsubmitted very late, plus the need to have, but\ndifficulty in obtaining, up-to-date information on\nour financial position, has led to a lot of time being\nwasted during meetings handing out and reading\npapers. Apologies for the many times that has been\nmy fault. I'm very pleased to say that most members\nof UFC have nevertheless managed to take a very\npositive part in its running.\nA number of problems have arisen during the\nyear. The Union accounts were not finalised and\nreturned from the College finance section until\nJanuary of this year, which left us for some months\nwith no clear picture of our financial position. The\nmain cause can probably be tracked down to a lack\nof continuity in the College staff preparing the\naccounts over the years. Hopefully this should be\nsorted out by the imminent appointment of a Union\nbook keeper. At the time of writing the final details\nof this new post have not been decided, but it is\ninevitable that they will have to be responsible for\nthe presentation of a coherent set of all the Union's books (ie the Union, MSC and CCU accounts will\nhave to be rational is ed into the same format and\nat least partially prepared by the book keeper).\nAnother major problem was Dave Kingston's apparent lack of ability to understand what was\ngoing on, particularly over the grant to Nightline\nand the prospects for a College loan to buy a glider.\nThe part of the Union that has caused me the\ngreatest number of headaches is Boat Club. Whilst\nwishing to detract nothing from their considerable\nsuccesses, their representatives consistently do\nbelieve that the Union has limitless amounts of\nmoney to spend on them, and that an altogether\nseparate mechanism for applying for such funds\nshould exist to facilitate this process.\nOur sub vent ion for the coming year has not\nreceived final approval yet, but I do not believe\nthere will be any cause for further cuts within the\nbudget as it now stands. The submission of our\nclaim was conducted in a slightly different manner\nthis year, particularly in the extent to which claims\nwere cut before initial submission to College. This\nhad not been my initial intention, but when I received estimates from the various parts of the\nUnion it was evident that certain groups were\nbehaving less responsibly than they ought. I believe\nthat, for the most part, the claims now submitted\nto the College contain far fewer anomalies and are\nfairer than would have been achieved by any other\nlikely method.\nIn the long term the Union's financial situation\nis likely to remain tight, with little room for\nexpansion except through external revenue sources.\nI do not believe however, that the Union is likely\nto face any major cutbacks, unless the College's position becomes very much worse than can\npresently be envisaged. Given that so much of the\nUnion's resources are channelled straight into\nstudent activities, such as sports and recreation, any\ndrastic cut here whilst producing only marginal\nbenefits to the College financially, would devastate\nits already thin appeal to students.\nThanks to Ken Weale for taking on an eleventh\nthree-year term as Union Treasurer, and to all the\nother Treasurers who keep the system running. Also\nto Charles Eagle for the many(!) hours put in as\nAuditor to the Union's accounts.\nTrading Services\nThe Bookshop continues to perform well, limited\nonly by lack of space and cut-backs in University\nand therefore library spending. The Sportshop made\na profit for the first time last year. Both continue\nto be run with great professionalism by Ray Hicks.\nI will admit to paying very little attention to the\nBookshop this year, but this is entirely Ray's fault\nas he runs it all too smoothly.\nThe catering outlet is also doing well. Norman\ngoes relentlessly from strength to strength with\nadded attractions of opening during week-day\nevenings, and also catering for private dinners in\nthe UDH. Sadly the problem of recruiting and\nkeeping catering staff has again risen its head this\nyear, and once again the saving grace has been ex-or dormant students. The provision, or not, of\nHalaal meals has been, and remains, a strongly\ndebated issue.\nMeanwhile back at the bar not all in the garden\nhave been roses, but things have settled down quite\nquickly. At the start of the year the bar manager\nMoore Lyttle resigned, and Kevin Buckley was\nappointed, first temporarily, then permanently once\nthe post had been unsuccessfully advertised\nexternally. Sean Davis and Dominic Darbyshire\nwere appointed as barmen. At the start of the\nautumn term the Lounge Bar began opening on a regular basis, and whilst it is not always packed,\nit does do well particularly when the Snack Bar is\nopen.\nKevin has proved to be especially good at dealing\nwith brewery reps and has to date arranged for two\nitems of bar improvements to be paid for by\ndifferent breweries. Full marks for enthusiasm,\nKev.\nOne issue I have received particular criticism\nover has been the allocation of late licenses. The\nDeputy President is responsible for recommending\nto both the Union and College licence es, which\nstudent events should be allowed to apply for late\nlicences. The criteria that I have used to decide this\nare whether the late bar would be catering to a special occasion (rather than effectively being the\nspecial occasion), how many, and how widely\nbased, were the people attending, and whether other\nevents, particularly of a similar nature, were likely\nto be taking place around the same time. I will admit\nto having made some mistakes over the allocation\nof late licences. I believe I was right not to apply\nfor a licence, where somebody has said \"the event\nfailed because there was no extension\", only where\n\"it detracted from the success\".\nOn the question of trading ventures as revenue\nsources: the Bookshop appears to have reached a stage where, barring periods of major\nrefurbishment, the main Union and CCUs can\nexpect to receive a small but regular income as at\npresent. The Snack Bar will almost certainly never\ncontribute to the Union's income, and nor should\nit. It is at present returning sufficient profit to cover\nfuture refurbishment, whilst providing a good and\ncheap service to students. The bar is making a good\nprofit, whilst still providing cheap (but not\nirresponsibly so) drinks to students. It should be\ncapable of becoming a source of revenue in a few\nyears, but not just yet.\nUnion Council\nOccasionally a little fraught, but usually useful\nand informative. A lot of criticism has revolved\naround late distribution, or lack of papers. In\nanswer to those whilst it is obviously preferable to\nhave papers a long time in advance, that has not\nproved practical for much of this year when\nmeetings to be discussed (particularly mine) have\noften taken place just the week before. My reports\nhave tended to be a little thin. Apologies to those\nwho like reading reports but, rightly or wrongly\n(probably wrongly), report writing has invariably\ntaken a back seat to doing things.\nThankfully throughout the year most members\nhave attempted to make the best of a bad job, a much more constructive attitude than some of the\nhistrionics displayed.\nI'd just like to add that I believe we've had an\nexcellent Council chairperson this year, very\nprofessional and fair, and such lovely legs!\nUGMs\nNot many people turn up to these. Have you\nnoticed? No, of course not, 'cos you don't go either,\ndo you? I offer no theories as to why no one goes.\nThere have, yet again, been the quorum callers\nintent on stopping policy they disagree with, but\nmercifully they have been more restrained and\nresponsible than in previous years, and we've had\nsome good debate and even a few new policies. The\n\"tie-club motion\" was as to rmer and ought to\nbecome a regular event. As for those who reckon\nstudent politics do no good, witness how quickly\nBarclay's withdrew from South Africa when we\nonly talked about boycotting them.\nMajor Sub-Committees\nI have tried to attend as many MSC meetings as\npossible this year. I am confident that all the MSC\nchairpersons run very tight ships and should all be\ncongratulated. One particular meeting I would not\nmiss for the world is Publications Board. A truly\ndelightful bun-fight. Long may it run.\nGoverning Body, etc\nThe Governor's committees (Governing Body,\nFinance and Exec and House committees) have been\nquite fun this year. I 've heard some truly\noutstanding rubbish from some, sheer pearls of\nwisdom from others and been gripped with fear\neverytime Dave Colley says anything, in case its\nanother story from \" My Dad's Garage\" (he's actually been very well behaved and made more\npertinent points than I have).\nI always get the impression that decisions have\nalready been taken by the time they get here and\nmost of the business is just rubber-stamping. House\ncommittee is something of an exception and so is\nmuch more interesting. The rest are mainly good\nsources of information.\nIt has struck me that every time a financial crisis\nis mentioned, the solution always arrived upon is\nto recruit more overseas students. No one seems\ntoo concerned that maybe they don't want to come\nhere.\nCatering and Conference Services etc\nThis is a wonderful opportunity to watch the\ninternal politics of Imperial College played out, with\nthe main protagonists (including ourselves) within\neasy spitting distance of each other! And yet\nsurprisingly they actually got things decided here.\nThe main battle for the JCR took place here (the\nvitriol flowed thick and fast), Southside refectory\nwas done up, money exchanges hands, great stuff.\nIts subsidiary committees, on the other hand,\nhave been something of a damp s qui b by\ncomparison. Both of the ones I attend, Refectory\nusers and College Bar committees, have been newly\nset up with the deliberate intention of being toothless\ntalking shops, OK for passing on suggestions and\ncomplaints but, if anything major happens, the\nworld falls apart.\nBar committee has been by far the worst which,\nconsidering that I'm chairperson for it, is probably\na shocking indictment of myself. I have in fact\ncalled only one meeting of it this year which was\nsuch a farce I haven't bothered since. I expect we\nshall have one more meeting to discuss bar prices\nfor the coming year, which will probably be the\nonly positive thing that could emerge from such a set up.\nFreshers' Week\nA truly horrible experience! Not eased any by\nthe antics of several burk s, part icu a rly the ones who\ndecided to \"flan\" the people on stage at the\nRector's reception.\nThe weeks' Ent's event were very well attended\nand well received, but an incredible amount of work\nfor the three office sabbaticals. On both the Monday\nand Friday we were all working non-stop until\nseveral hours after the events finished. The jobs\ninvolved were everything from checking Union\ncards, to pacifying the police, to chasing people\nAnnual Reports 5\n\n"

    "content": "from some officers, but meetings have generally\nrun smoothly give or take a few petty bickering s.3. Union Finance Committee\nThis seems to have been immensely sensible in\nits outlook. All credit to Jackie for hours of\ngroundwork before meetings (even if paperwork\nwas haphazard). There will always be divisions at\nUFC between CCUs and clubs committees but final\ndecisions this year have been amazingly reasonable\nand even-handed.\n4. Major Sub-Committees\nThe MSCs, too, have been remarkable for their\nsmooth and sensible running for which all credit\ngoes to their respective chairs and commit tess. Points of particular note:\nIt is good to see the formation of a thriving (and\nbadly-needed) film society, also good to see the\nconsiderable successes of many sports and\nrecreational teams. Thanks are due to Frank Potter,\nretiring after many years' service as RCC senior\ntreasurer.\nThe Overseas Student Committee held an\nimmensely successful and enjoyable 'International\nNite' at the start of the year. They have also\nmourned the tragic death of long-standing junior\ntreasurer, Jose Molina\u2014a lovely and much missed\nperson.\nPublications Board's interminable meetings have\ngiven rise to some highly useful developments\u2014\nnotably those for alleviating FELIX equipment\nreplacement costs.\n5. Internal Services\nBar, Catering, Bookshop and Sportshop have all\nflourished this year. Day-to-day running has been\nhandled efficiently by managers Kev Buckley,\nNorman Jardine and Ray Hicks respectively, whilst\nthe respective Union committees have monitored\nperformance and handled policy questions.\nThe Internal Services Committee, whilst tending\nto repeat events of its sub-committees, has also\nproduced the skeleton of an integrated services\npublicity scheme and healthy long-term plans for\neach of the services.\n6. House Commitee\nAlthough it has often tended to concentrate on\ndetails the House Committee has eventually come\nup with some major ideas for Union Building\nrefurbishment\u2014some of which should be carried\nout before next session, notably refurbishment of\nthe Union gym and Dining Hall. It is amazing how\nlittle interest there is in this committee, in the Union\nas a whole\u2014it controls a very substantial budget\nand has the potential for initiating large projects.\n7. ENTS\nThere has been a great deal of criticism of ENTS\nthis year for failing to be financially accountable,\nfailure to provide good events, and as always, for\nbeing a 'clique'. Some of this criticism is deserved\nalthough most people who bothered to attend the\nfirst term's ENTS events might have found them\nenjoyable. I have also been criticised for my defence\nof Dan Phillips and ENTS but I still feel there is\nsome case for my stance. A lot of hard work was\ndone and the ENTS budget was not overspent.\nENTS at Imperial is also a frustrating exercise due\nto the lack of space and resources compared to\nmany other colleges. However there is no excuse\nfor failure to be accountable and it is not surprising\nthat this led to claims of embezzlement!\nENTS next year is to receive a considerable\ninjection both of resources and of morale; I am\nconfident that this year's problems will not occur\nagain.\n8. Executive Committee and CCUs\nGuilds and Mines appear to have had a very good\nyear; RCS has had internal squabbling s which I have attempted to keep well away from. One thing\nis certain though; that is that Duncan, Rob and\nSimon have succeeded in maintaining a good\nbalance between CCU interests and their position\nas vice-presidents of Imperial College Union. Exec\nmeetings have ranged from totally zombie-like to\nslightly hysterical, but have reached sensible\ndecisions whenever the need arose. Big thanks to\nDuncan, Rob and Simon for all their work.\n9. Academic Affairs\nAcademic Affairs meetings have attempted to\nshare experiences, tactics and ideas between\ndepartments. This is a good idea but is open to\nmono poli sing by the more voluble Dep-Reps. My\nfeeling is that they should rely as little as possible\non bureaucracy and trivia and aim more for broad\ndiscussion.\nAs usual the contact between Dep Reps and IC\nUnion has varied enormously; I have tried to\nimprove this by informal meetings but it seems that\nmany Dep Reps are surprised by the amount of\ndepartmental work they've taken on and are\nunwilling to take on more.\nThe ability of a sabbatical to apply pressure on\nacademic matters without fears of academic\n'reprisal' should not be underestimated. This has\nbeen proved repeatedly this year with several\nsuccessful cases from full scale academic appeals\nto minor departmental disputes.\n10. Rag\nDespite the lack of a Rag Mag (due, it seems,\nto fear of censorship) and various internal problems\nin the Rag Committee there have been a number\nof highly successful Rag events this year. There\nhave also been a few flops; some in spite of\nexcellent prior organisation and publicity. It seems\nto be essential to reconsider the nature of these\nevents in the future. Meanwhile, many people have\nworked extremely hard on Rag this year; and the\ncommittee has come up with some excellent new\nideas for next year (including a 'clean' Rag Mag!)\n//. Welfare\nThe Union Welfare Committee suffered from\nlack of a welfare officer for much of the year but\nstill managed to hold a couple of successful\ncampaigns\u2014on security and the welfare\nquestionnaire. I have attempted to keep welfare\nmatters going with the AIDS campaign. I hope that\nnext year's welfare committee will get off the\nground more successfully and attempt to work with\nthe new College Welfare Advisor in building a realistic and worthwhile service.\n12. External Affairs\nThe Union has seen two External Affairs Officers\nand substantial periods without. My own\ninvolvement in external affairs has been\nrestricted\u2014much to my annoyance\u2014by time\nproblems. As a result the External Affairs\nCommittee has been largely inactive. See section\nD for more on external affairs.\n13. Transport\nAs a non-driver my involvement in transport\nbusiness has been minimal. However I have taken\npart in transport committees, which must be the\nmost tedious meetings ever. A move away from\nminute detail towards broad transport policy and\nappeals from van users would be a good thing. The\ntransport system as a whole however, is flourishing.\n14. Postgraduate Group\nThere has been very little sign of life this year\n(although Gareth Fish will probably disagree with\nme). I hope this is due to the failure of news to reach\nthe Union Office rather than due to total inactivity.\nThe involvement of postgraduate students in main\nUnion affairs is still very small although plenty of\nPGs are involved in clubs and societies.\n15. FELIX\nI have left FELIX to last as it really needs a section of its own.\nThe relationship between ICU 'central' and\nFELIX has been excellent this year for which I am\nextremely grateful\u2014as I am for being allowed a free\nhand with my weekly column! There have been\nmany criticisms of FELIX this year (as, I am sure,\nthere always will be). I am not in a position to\ncomment on its content, however to have got the\npaper out every week\u2014albeit with some close\nshaves\u2014is a feat it itself, considering all the teething\nproblems associated with a complete change of\npremises, equipment and staff. It has amazed me\nto see how much time is spent on producing,\ncollating and distributing the paper; and how\ndedicated FELIX 'regulars' are. I no longer think\n(as I did for 3 years) that FELIX appears from\nnowhere every Friday. For all this, Dave Jones,\nthe FELIX staff and volunteers deserve a medal,\nlet alone my thanks.\nExternal & Miscellaneous\nUniversity of London Union\nULU was threatened with closure at the start of\nthe year with the prospects of a50% cut in funding\nfrom the University Grants Committee to the\nCentral University of London. However the\nsituation now appears to be safe for the next few\nyears with ULU in fact receiving a small increase\nin funds. Much of ULU's activity this year has been\ncampaigning against the possibility of the cuts.\nImperial has supported the action with petitions,\npostcard signing, demonstrations\u2014most of the\nExternal Affairs Committee's limited activity has\nbeen on this issue.\nGeneral Union Council (the ' U GM' of ULU!)\nmeetings have been of limited value and involved\na lot of time-wasting. As usual (I'm told) IC was\none of the most consistent Colleges, managing to\nturn out all 9 delegates for most meetings. GUC\nis hampered by individuals' speeches in response\nto the simplest of questions when the point could\nbe made in five words.\nI believe ICU's relationship with ULU has, this\nyear, been excellent; our delegates' contributions\nto GUC debate has surprised many who still\nconsidered Imperial to be a bunch of right-wing\npsychopaths.\nOther London Colleges\nThe value of contact with other colleges of the\nUniversity cannot be underestimated. Although\nattempts to improve social contact with the Royal\nColleges of Art and Music proved to be abortive,\nrelationships with other students' Unions have been\nvery helpful. For instance, many unions gave advice\non our plans for office reorganisation; University\nCollege Union gave a lot of advice on the St Mary's merger stemming from their similar experiences;\nand Kings College Union have been very helpful\nin sorting out the aftermath of the 'raid' on the ICU\noffice by some Kings Rag representatives.\nAs ICU is outside the NUS it is sometimes\ndifficult\u2014but all the more crucial\u2014to build up close\nrelationships with other unions to the point where\nthey are happy to pass on information and advice.\nULU training school and GUC meetings were\ninvaluable for forming the initial contacts.\nNUS\nAlthough Imperial is reputed to be next on the\nlist of potential affiliations, there has been\nsurprisingly little approach from the National Union\nof Students this year. At the start of the year, whilst\nmaking is plain that opinion at Imperial is fairly\nhostile to the idea of re-affiliation, I offered NUS\nrepresentatives the chance to put their case here;\nthat offer was not taken up. This is hardly surprising\nAnnual Reports 3\n\n"

    "content": "Trading Services\nAnother good year generally for Union outlets,\nthe most impressive successes being achieved by\nthe Sports Shop and Norman's. Norman's The extension of the service into the area of\nevening meals has grown in popularity thro gh out the year and the Easter Vacation try out period\nalong with catering for formal dinners in the UDH\nboth show great promise for the future. The\nreputation of London's favorite student eatery even\nstretched as far as the city wide student rag 'London\nStudent'. Earlier in the year they dispatched one\nof their crack investigative reporters to look into\nreports that herbal tea can increase one's sexual\nprowess. The Sunday Sport has not yet called.\nWe are hoping to be able to sell condoms in this\noutlet in the near future.\nSports Shop\nThe pulling power of ICU fatty Dave Colley in\nan IC jogging/romper suit proved to be a valuable\nasset. Takings have soared to new highs and a record profit is anticipated. It is also hoped that the\nshop will get a new front similar to the one which\nSTA had installed last year.\nBook Shop\nReduced spending by College libraries has served\nto reduce the overall level of takings although\ncounter sales have increased. Having computer e is ed the shop's accounts this year, the next 12 months\nshould see the introduction of an automated stock\ncontrol system. We are also hopeful that the shop\nwill be able to find a way to increase its space.\nUnion Bar\nQuite a lot of money has been spent on new\nequipment this year, primarily on replacing worn\nout ref ridge ration equipment and providing a music\nsystem. The response to the many evening events\norganised by the Bar Manager Kev Buckley has\nbeen rather erratic to say the least. This is not at\nall in proportion to the amount of graft which he\nhas put into this area over the year and I hope that\nnext year will be better. In response to many\ncomplaints about the smell of the Gent's toilets, we\nintroduced automatic air freshen er systems which\nhave, in my opinion served to alleviate the problem\nalthough a long term solution to the Union\nBuilding's lavatory problem is still required.\nEtc etc\nThis report is only a summary of the main issues\nconsidered by the ISC. The Committee considers\na whole range of service-related issues and I believe\nthat it provides an invaluable discussion forum for\nthe development of Union services. Now that next\nyear's ISO elect is unable to do the job I hope that\nthere will be somebody willing to take his place,\nany interested parties can contact me through the\nUnion Office.\nAlan Rose\nPostgraduate\nA AO The year has been more of a behind the scenes\naction rather than front page news. Due to work\nand injury I have not been as active as I might have\nbeen. In December I missed my first ICUGM for\n5 years due to being away at a conference. In\nJanuary I wrecked my right ankle and it caused me\nto miss both Council and Board of Studies, and I was out of action for about 6 weeks. Despite this\nI still managed to make the most of the meetings\nthat I was supposed to go to.\nUGM'sI 've missed 2, the first since 1981\u2014I 've\ncontributed speaking at most and I wish Alastair\nSeymour good luck in his chairing of UGM's next\nsession. This session we've not seen much of the\nright versus left battles but have achieved some\nuseful things, despite the presence of a few\npl on kers. UGM's should be more fun but there is\nno way that we can motivate ordinary students to\ncome to UGM's under the current climate.\nCouncil\nI 've been to most Council meetings except the\n8/12/86 meeting because I had to go to another\nimportant meeting in the City and the one at the\nend of January because I could not get across to\nthe Union safely on crutches. I felt that most of the\ndiscussion has been worthwhile but there has been\na lot of petty squabbling which has tended to cause\nmeetings to drag on for too long.\nBoard of Studies\nUnfortunately I 've been unable to go to most of\nthe meetings of the BOS. I am still very disturbed\nabout the College plan to sack 100 members of staff\nand recruit 500 new overseas PG's at \u00a35,000 each,\nat the expense of HGC students. Soon College will\nfind it impossible to recruit outside home students\nfrom universities outside London and as a result\nacademic standards in research will collapse.\nGraduate Studies Committee\nThis only meets once a term. I 've been to both\nmeetings so far and I must say I 've enjoyed them.\nWe've got quite a few important course changes\nand general course regulations. The new PG\nHandbook was circulated to the members, who\nwere all quite impressed with it. It's a pity though\nthat College have cut tea and biscuits from the\nCommittee\nUndergraduate Studies Committee\nI represented Christine for 1 meeting discussing\nthe Chemistry UG course. A healthy discussion\nfollowed but I was still left with the impression I had when I was an undergraduate in Chemistry in\nthat the whole purpose of the Chemistry Department\nis to generate new graduates to do research in\nChemistry, and that undergraduate teaching is a poor relation to research requirements.\nPG Group\nThis has held one successful party in conjunction\nwith Silwood. We've been fairly quiet on the mass\nsocial front but the vast majority of departments\nhave enjoyed parties and other social events\npartially funded by the Group. We have held quite\na few discussions on PG matters.\nThanks to Chris Martin we have a new PG\nHandbook. I 've also spent considerable time\nhelping a couple of unfortunate students with their\nproblems. I also went to an managerial meeting of\nthe UL PG Group which appears to have\nsubsequently died. The AGM will be held towards\nthe end of this term. I also represented PG's and\nthe Union at the opening of the new Holland Club.\nDES\nI'm glad that the DES has finally admitted that\nthe student grant is not enough to live on but I don't think that they will do anything about it during my\nfinal year as an impoverished student. It has also\nbeen noted that for London, area weightings have\nfallen massively for students and that the London\nAllowance should have increased by more than\n10% last year but only went up to cover the rise\nin inflation.\nTo summarise, the year has been a quiet one for\nthe Central PG Group but busy departmental-wise,\nI 've not done as much work as I could have but\nI think that the year has been a successful one. I 've\nenjoyed my second year as PGAAO and I 've also\nmanaged to combine Cricket Club and RCS Motor\nClub as well. I 've worked hard and hopefully I will\nget my PhD. I 've also worked on the bar and I'm glad it's a success despite the vast majority of\nstudents going down to Southside. Finally, I 'll wish\nyou a successful year next year and I hope the\npresidential farce is soon sorted out. I think that\nI will be glad to get out of IC after 6 years but I must say I 've enjoyed myself.\nGareth Fish\nRag Chairman I am glad to say that the general gist of this year's report is a very good one. The strength of Rag has\ncontinued to grow both amongst College and with\nthe students throughout the year. Previous\nweaknesses last year were identified and made\npriority issues to get right this year. The problem\nof publicity was identified very early on, and to\nthis end a publicity team headed by Michael Condon\nwas set up within the first few weeks of the Autumn\nTerm. Recognising that the major market for\npotential rag participants lay with the fresher s, the\nteam saturated all the halls of Southside, Linstead\nand Weeks with publicity, with some other people\ncovering the student houses in Evelyn Gardens.\nConsequently, fresher s were made aware of Rag's activities and aims this year from the very\nbeginning, and rag took off to an excellent start.\nThe traditional tid d ley winks down Oxford Street\nthis year broke the \u00a33000 pound barrier, which\neluded last year's effort, by \u00a3400. Similarly.\nHuman Monopoly in the first term proved to be\nthe best ever by raising over \u00a32.400, which is over\n\u00a3 1,500 more than last year. Almost every event this\nyear has surpassed last years' totals for that event,\nincluding the hypnosis lecture, beer festival and the\nRag and Drag disco in Rag Week\u2014results very\ndeserved for the hard work and effort members of\nthe Rag committee put in.\nNew stunts this year included our first attempt\nto have joint rag events between different\nuniversities such as Nottingham.

The usual Rag mix of\nentertainment and silliness was the\norder of the day and anyone who\nfinished mud-free or dry was\ndefinitely in the minority. The fe te was also an opportunity for the more\nserious side of Rag, that of raising\nmoney for charity, to be seen. Two\ncheques for \u00a31517 were presented and\nalso on display, although missed by\nmost, was the new Variety Club\nSunshine coach for the Rectory\nPaddock Mentally Handicapped\nfrom those who ran stalls to those who\ndidn't disappear when it came to the\ndrudgery of clearing up. A few people\ndeserve special mentions; Emma for\ntaking the party off my hands, Rachel\nfor helping count the money and\nChristine, Abi and Rufus for not\nbugger ing off ten minutes before the\nend of the party.\nI'm sure that most of you will have\nseen the new 'Lemmings Fate '88' Tshirts and will want one, well they can\nnow be bought from Kathy in the\nUnion Office for the paltry sum of\n\u00a33.50.

All this adds\nup to rather jolly good value for\nmoney if you ask me (not that you\nwould).\nSecondly the election papers went\nup on Tuesday so put your name\ndown if you're interested. The papers\ncome down on Tuesday the 26th when\nthere will be a meeting (or rather\nelection) in the Lounge at 1.00pm. All\ncandidates should be there and anyone\ncan vote.

To make up for\nthis, we want to produce an edition\nfor the start of next year\u2014and we\nneed your contributions. Why not, in\nthose dull times between mugging up\nfor exams, put pen to paper to\nproduce short stories, poems,\nsketches, cartoons or short non-fiction\narticles\u2014on any topic that catches\nyour fancy.

    "content": "Union FELIX, Friday May 15th19876 Christine writes\nIC\nGay\nOkay\nI'm glad to say that things are\nbeginning to move at last. Firstly, at\nICU Council on Monday I was co-opted\nas Lesbian and Gay Welfare Officer\nafter a fire y speech by Hurricane\nChristine, who deserves all the credit.\nBetter than that, though, is that as\na result of recent publicity people have\nstarted getting in touch with me. and\nthe members of our Wednesday\nmeetings are gradually increasing. I can only say again that if you do want\nto come along please do, and if you\nwant to chat with me first I can be\nreached via the Union Office, or via\nGeology pigeonholes.\nI don't seriously expect any Gay\nmovement at IC really to get off the\nground until next term\u2014the summer\nterm is not the campaign season, after\nall. However, if we manage to get next\nterm off to a good start, hopefully with\na stall at Freshers' Fair, then we should\ndo pretty well. It is important that we\nkeep ticking over until then, so that\nanyone who does want to come and\nsee us can, and so that we have a nucleus with which to get going next\nyear.\nThanks to the people who turned up\non Wednesday\u2014I'm very sorry I didn't.I hope you managed to have\na meeting anyway. See you next\nweek. 12.30 in the Green Committee\nRoom in the Union Building.\nBye for now,\nAndrew Bannister\nResidences\nAt the next Student Residence\nCommittee on Wednesday 27th May\nthere will be a long and tortuous\ndiscussion about rent increases for\nnext session. Throughout the\nnegotiations about buying the new\nEvelyn Gardens houses I have\nrepeatedly said that College must go\nahead with the purchase. It is my view\nthat accommodation near College is\ngoing to become more and more\ndifficult to find and that given the gap\nbetween rents in private\naccommodation in this area and those\nin student residences. 1 feel that we\nshould be prepared to accept a rent\nincrease in order to pay for the new\nhouses.\nNobody wants this to happen, and\nmany people have said 'let College\nfind the money from elsewhere'.\nGiven the severe restrictions placed on\nthe College by the UGC over the\nspending of public funds\u2014and given\nthe College's own \u00a33M deficit\u2014this is\nrather optimistic to say the least.\nResidences have, by law, to be self-financing or paid for by the College's private income. One of the few ways\nof financing the loan to buy new\nhouses would be to use the income\nfrom the sale of Harlington Gravel; this\nwould reduce the necessary rent\nincrease from around \u00a37.50pw over\nseveral years to about \u00a35pw over the\nsame time. On the other hand it would\nend plans for a new indoor sports hall\nto be paid for by the gravel money.\nOne argument frequently used in\nthis context is the fact that, since\nstudents cannot claim housing benefit\nwhen living in hall, they would\nactually be better off living in private\nsector accommodation if hall rents go\nup by so much. The other side of this\nargument is the fact that the\nConservatives are committed to taking\nstudents out of the benefits system\naltogether and if they return to power\non June 11th( as seems likely) then\nstudents will quite probably no longer\nbe able to claim benefit wherever they\nlive. This makes the need to provide\ncheaper accommodation for as many\nstudents as possible an even greater\npriority of the College.\n1 am firmly convinced that the\npurchase of this hall is essential and\nthat, since it is a once-in-a lifetime\nopportunity, and is not purely a prestige, conference type facility we\nshould be prepared to accept rent\nincreases to pay for it. I have therefore\nencouraged the College to go ahead\nwith the deal. If the student body is\nunwilling to accept the necessary\nincreases after the purchase, and if the\nmoney cannot be found elsewhere,\nthen the building will have to be sold\nand the 200 extra residence places will\nbe lost.\nPLEASE come to the AGM next\nTuesday if you have a view on this\nmatter\u2014hopefully we can come to\nsome sort of consensus on the issue.\nLesbian and Gay Welfare\nLast Monday, Council decided to make\nthe post of the Lesbian and Gay\nWelfare Officer a permanent one. The\npost will be a non-voting one on\nCouncil, currently held by a co-opted\nvolunteer but in future by a nominee\nof the Lesbian and Gay Society\u2014when\none officially comes into existence.\nIt is true that any Union member\ncan attend Council and ask for\nspeaking rights. However this is a positive commitment by Council to\nridding Imperial College once and for\nall of its ridiculously homophobic\nattitudes and atmosphere. I have been\nwaiting for four years to see some\nprogress in this direction and I'm proud that it has happened during my\nterm of office.\nAndy Bannister of Geology I has\nbeen co-opted by Council to carry out\nthis role for the remainder of the year,\nsince Robert Daniel has left College.\nRag\nLast Saturday's Rag Fete was a great\nsuccess\u2014helped by perfect weather\nand a lot of hard work by the people\nconcerned.

As usual\nthe trouble-makers were not the ones\nto clear up the mess, and surveying\nthe damage at 2.30amI really\nwondered why people carry on\nputting on events like this to be met\nby plenty of hassle and few thanks.\nNone the less they do\u2014I for one am\nmost grateful (\n1 even enjoyed most of\nthe party immensely!) and would like\nto extend thanks to Nigel, Rachel, Man\nTai and all the others who worked so\nhard on Saturday.\nFinally\nDon't forget the Union's Annual\nGeneral Meeting next Tuesday, 1pm in Mech Eng 220.

    "content": "Honorary\nSecretary\nIntroduction\nAt last year's AGM two of the sabbatical reports\nwere referred back to the writer because they\nexpressed the author's opinions of the situation, the\nargument being that the sabbaticals should not say\nwho in their opinion had not been pulling their\nweight or express opinions on situations or actions\nof people. My article will be representative of my\nviews of any situation, as I can't view a situation\nfrom any other angle, and my advice to anybody\nwho wishes to chuck it out on those grounds is:\nIf you don't want opinions, next year elect a computer, because I'm not going to write falsities\njust to get my report passed.\n1. Transport\na. Administration\nThe transport system has on the whole worked\nvery well this year with very few complaints and\nno enforced cancellations by me. I tried this year\nto continue along the same route Quentin began last\nyear as this seemed to work very well for him. The\nonly real problem to arise from this was in the\nprocess of shared costing. To put the shared costing\nprocedure into action for any given weekend, it is\nnecessary to have all the transport slips back and\nin my possession. The lateness of some clubs with\nthis procedure meant that the billing for some\nweekends has been put back by up to a term and\na bit. This has led to a transport committee decision\nthat the booking form be changed, and I shall be\nrecommending a new format to Chas. For this year\nit has been possible to override the shared costing\nprocedure by giving a club an inside hire and an\noutside hire van, this multiplies the shared effect.\nThere was some suggestion that the Transport\nCommittee is superfluous to the transport system,\nexcept for large decisions, and to some extent I would go along with that. The main argument for\nthis decision is that any decisions in transport need\nusually to be taken quickly, so calling a meeting\nis out. If the committee can't be called then it can't operate so why have it? The main argument for the\ncommittee is it makes the Transport Officer and\nthe Hon Sec immediately accountable (and we do\nhave a large turnover to look after). On the whole\nthough it might be a good idea to get rid of the\nTransport Committee and call meetings when\nproblems arise.\nb. The Union Minibuses\nThese vans have held up remarkably well under\nstudent use and we have had remarkably few\nproblems with them. This year has seen the buying\nof a new minibus (BLR) and the paying for of\nanother (WLE). HLO has been sold for a not\nunreasonable sum and the fleet seems to be ticking\nover nicely. The major problems have been an\nelectrical problem with KLO, braking problems\nwith AHU and some starter problems on the same\nvan. I decided to stick with Quentin's decision,\ntaken last year, to maintain the van fleet at 5, and\nhave found that this was a very necessary decision\nto take and maybe the number will have to be\nincreased again. At the end of the year a new 17\nseater will be bought to replace KLO, so I 've begun\nmy task of searching out a bargain price for one.\nThe other major point to have come out of the IC\ntransport system this year is the role of the\nTransport Officer. This post is very ill-defined and\nwith the annual comings and goings in each post,\nthere are areas where effort can be overlapped or\nleft out depending upon the whims and fancies of\nboth officers. It is my aim to invent a job description\nalong with my successor and the Transport Officer\nand his successor before my year has run.\nc. Outside Hire Buses\nThis year I have used only Translocation as my\nsupplier of outside hire vehicles, but this doesn't mean that I have not looked about for a cheaper,\nand better, source of vehicles. On the whole this\nyear people have given me reasonable notice of\ncancellations so everything is OK there, but they\ntend not to tell me about any accidents they have\nuntil I'm confronted by the company involved.\nd. Accidents\nAll the accidents with other motor vehicles this\nyear have resulted with no damage at all to our\nvans, but seemingly being able to inflict severe\ndamage to the other party. The only plea here is,\nplease report your accidents.\n2 Insurance\na. Club Insurance\nThere have been two claims made on this\ninsurance policy this year and as usual the insurance\ncompanies are taking their time over settling them\nwith us. The premium remained the same as last\nyear but the excess rose from \u00a310 to \u00a3100 and with\nthe claim being minimal this year it appears that\na concession from the insurance company should\nbe forthcoming. At the beginning of my term in\noffice all clubs were asked to provide the Union\nwith an inventory. One year has passed so I'm left\nto assume that 60% of the Union hasn't bought\nanything over the year. (If you are reading this\nplease get me an inventory soon).\nb. Hall of Residence Insurance\nThe full running of this insurance was handed\nover to the Union at the beginning of my term of\noffice, the idea being that direct student to student\ncontact on a temperamental issue such as this would\nbe worthwhile. The whole procedure was made\nrather ineffective by the failure of the College group\nhandling the swap to inform both myself and\nsecurity of the full demands of the insurance\ncompany and a three to four month delay was the\nleast claimants could expect to wait for settlement\nfrom this.\nIt was only due to some sterling assistance from\nTerry Bixley in security that the whole process got\nmoving again so quickly and now the settlement\npayments are beginning to filter in.\nLast term Students Services expressed an interest\nin the running of the insurance process, as it is\nindeed a Student Residence Service, so\nconsequently arrangements will be made for next\nyear to transfer the running of this policy to Students\nServices in Princes Gardens, unless any second\nthoughts prevent this.\n3 Duplicating Service\nThis is where some major advances are taking\nplace this year in the area of cost cutting while\nproviding a reasonably efficient and high quality\nservice. The Union will now be buying its paper,\nrecycled, from a company called Paperback. This\nwas a response to Environmental Week and a UGM\nproposal and will probably save the Union up to\n50pa ream and \u00a3450 pa. Other savings to the Union\nhave come in the cheap buying of a stencil cutter\nand the a quis it ion of a Roneo duplicator. Special\nthanks must be made at this point to Mr Oakley\n(Chem Eng) for giving us miscellaneous office\nequipment (ranging from duplicating equipment to\naddressing equipment). A supply of stencils for the\nstencil cutter has been secured, so any club need\nonly type up minutes on paper instead of those old\nawful stencils. This year I have started helping\nanybody out with any duplicating work eg Chiswick\nAnti-Apartheid, and as long as the work is not\nrequired to be of really high quality, the new\nequipment will ensure that a reasonable standard\nof reproduction can be obtained at reasonable rates.\nThe two photocopiers continue to give good copies\nto users and both have been serviced, and will be\nserviced again just before I leave, so Chas can start\nnice and clear.\n4 Union Committees\nExcept the MSC and Academic Affairs meetings\nI take the minutes on all the other committees. This\nmakes meetings a real chore and also harder to\nmake any worthwhile contribution to, as you have\nto write as well as talk. The planning groups set\nup this year have agreed that each committee should\nelect its own secretary to take minutes, so the\nsabbatical can be released for more useful jobs. The\ncommittees have ranged far and wide in frequency\nand usefulness with undoubtedly the Internal\nServices Committee leading the list on both these\npoints. The Internal Services Committee along with\nHouse Committee have caused some useful\nadditions to the bar and the Union Building as a whole, and have greater plans to do more. The other\ncommittees have been ineffectual or not really\nneeded (eg Transport), with maybe a slight\nexception in Exec, which is useful to stay in touch\nwith the CCUs.\nb. Council\nThis year I feel there was a very obvious lean\ntowards trying to get things done and not bickering\nover the petty things in Union life. The\nconsequences of this were that all councils were\nquo rate and the introduction of previously\ncontroversial issues (eg gay and lesbian, JCR and\nQT). The only problem with both Council and the\nUGM is the production of papers for the meeting,\npeople don't hand motions or reports to me until\nthe day of the meeting or the day of issue and\nconsequently their papers aren't out in advance. If\nI asked anybody to produce a document in five\nminutes, they would quite rightly say no, so give\nus a break and hand stuff in a week in advance.\nc. UGMs\nThese in contrast to 4b. have been on the whole\nin-quo rate( except for the EGM in QT which was\na record breaker), but this hasn't prevented some\nuseful business from being achieved eg AIDS, the\nJCR w rt QT, Tie Clubs and Recycled Paper. These\nhave on the other hand been stifling free of opinion\nand discussion of some of the more contentious\nissues, this has been due to the calling of 'quorum',\nbut more directly, the apathy of IC students about\ninternal and external affairs. Many times over the\nyears various sabbaticals have slated the apathy of\nstudents at Imperial College, but it seems that these\nrants fall on deaf ears and things haven't changed.\nFrom this it seems that perhaps the only way to\nmake any policy or decision will be to use only\nCouncil and scrap UGMs. As any student can attend\ncouncil only those interested will do so, leaving the\nrest to stew in apathy, and perhaps more policies\nand discussion can go through on the words of\nCouncil reps that are elected by the student body\nanyway.\nd. GUC\nThis in my opinion could have been a useful\nforum if only the same loudmouths let others from\nother colleges have a word in edgewise. The only\nthing that GUC seemed to be held for was so that\na small number of people could hear their own voice\nand have the added bonus of making us hear them.\nHowever some of the motions passed eg Quest\nfor a test for Cancer have been worthwhile and\nunopposed, but some of the other motions have in\nmy opinion at least, been un for see able by ULU or\nany student group\nAnnual Reports 7\n\n"

    "content": "News, FELIX, Friday May 15th198712 Watergate, Irangate,\nHowgate!\nIan Howgate (Geology III) has been\nelected as IC Union President for next\nyear. The election was re-held after*\nthe previous election was declared\ninvalid at the end of last term. Despite\nonly two candidates standing\nor ign in ally, the re-run produced a field of five candidates.\nIn a poll of 869 votes, Mr Howgate\npassed quota of 436 votes after three\nreallocations under the STV (Single\nTransferrable Vote) system used in\nICU sabbatical elections. He reached\na total of 442 votes, enough to reach\na clear majority of the votes cast.\nThe re-run election was\nconsiderably less acc rim i nous than the\nfirst. It was run in a blaze of apathy,\nwith no candidate producing any\npublicity until the Thursday before\npolling, a full week after papers were\ntaken down. The length of the 'phony\nwar' meant that candidates did not\nconduct campaigns as extensive as in\nrecent years.\nWhen questioned by a FELIX\nreporter, Mr Howgate gave some idea\nof his intentions and priorities for next\nyear. He was glad about the large\nfield of candidates and thought that\nthe turnout was quite high considering\nthe distraction of exams for most\nstudents. He said that one of his first\ntasks would be to learn more about\nexternal affairs, particularly ULU,\nabout which he confessed to having\nlittle knowledge. Also he wished to\nfind out about the extraction of gravel\nfrom the sports fields at Harlington,\na source of much confusion and\nmisinformed comment. He also wants\nto increase awareness of the Silwood\nPark field station, about which he felt\nthat IC students had little knowledge\napart from the RCS Silwood Ball in\nthe summer term. Perhaps one\nsolution would be to arrange some\nsort of visit early in the autumn term.\nMr Howgate said that he thought that\nsome sort of factual comparison for\nanswers to questions at the Hustings\nUGM would be useful, as most\nstudents would not be aware of the\ncorrect answers to more detailed\nquestions.\nSurprisingly, the election campaign\nseemed to be little affected by the\nknowledge that the other two\nsabbatical officers were already\nelected; Alan Rose as Deputy\nPresident and Chas Jackson as\nHonorary Secretary.\nA breakdown of the total voting\nfigures is given below showing the\nSTV system in operation, with\nallocation of preferences until one\ncandidate reaches or passes the\nrequired quota.\nTypesetting\nMarathon\nFELIX would like to say thankyou to\ntypesetter operator Rose Atkins, who\ntyped the whole of FELIX, including\nthe annual reports, in just over three\ndays. Rose said yesterday that she was\nlooking forward to thinner issues as\nthe term progressed. FELIX will be\nadopting a new policy of only\naccepting club articles if the club\nre ffe red to send along people to\ncollate. In addition, Dave Colley will\nhave to type all his articles. Any\nUnion Officer who is reading this\nafter submitting a report but not\nturning up to collate may consider\nthemselves humbled.\nEngineering\naward\nJames Sturgeon, a final year student\nin the Civ Eng Dept has won a prestigious prize at the Institute of\nCivil Engineers. This prize for the\nInstitution Medal and Premium\n(Universities) Competition was for a paper entitled; \"Being constructive\nwith people: man-management and\nthe role of the site engineer\". This\nwas the first national competition for\nthis prize for which entrants were\nrequired to write a4000 word essay.\nFive entrants were selected to make\na presentation and undergo a discussion about their papers.\nIC elections\nThere will be elections at the IC\nUnion Annual General Meeting\n(AGM) next Tuesday, in Mech. Eng.\n220 at 1.00pm. When papers came\ndown yesterday, the following posts\nwere contested: for five delegates to\nthe University of London Union\nGeneral Union Council (GUC), th,^\nwere six candidates; Chris Martin\n(DoC), Simon Bosher (Physics), D Clements (Physics), S Kilmurray\n(Physics), Dave Jones (Physics) and\nBill Goodwin (Mech. Eng.).\nAlso contested were the two\nordinary members of Union Finance\nCommittee (UFC); standing were\nSteve Kilmurray (Physics), Neil\nMotteram (DoC), A Pugh (Physics)\nand David Jones (Physics).\nAmongst the posts that were\nuncontested, Charles Brereton\n(Biochem) stood for Academic\nAffairs Officer, Alastair Seymour\n(Elec. Eng.) and Sunny Bains\n(Physics) stood for the two Ordinary\nMembers of Council, Kamala Sen\n(Geology) was unopposed for\nHaldane Book Buyer, and Chris\nMartin (DoC) was the only candidate\nfor FELIX Business Manager.\nThe papers for Haldane Library\nRecord Buyer are to stay up for a further period of time while the post\nis publicised more widely, and there\nwere no nominations for the positions\nof Publicity Officer and the three\nOrdinary Members of House\nCommittee.\nGay support\nICU Union Council has passed a motion in support of a non-voting\nCouncil post to represent gay and\nlesbian students at College. The\nmotion, prepared by Union President\nChristine Taig and seconded by\nDeputy President Jackie Peirce, called\nfor Council's backing for gay and\nlesbian welfare officer. This is\ncurrently a co-opted post, but it is\nhoped that a Gay Society will shortly\nbe in existence, and that this society\nwill be able to nominate its own\nrepresentative.\nElec Eng Dep Rep Alistair\nSeymour questioned whether creating\na post to represent the Gay Society\nmight \"open the floodgates for all\nCollege clubs and societies to demand\ntheir own representative\". Academic\nAffairs Officer Dave Lowrie\ncommented that all societies already\nhad representation through the major\nsub-committee chairman.\nMs Taig and several other speakers\nthought that it was a very positive\nmove to create a specific non-voting\npost for gay and lesbian students.\nWhen taken to a vote the motion was\npassed unanimously.\n\n"

    "content": "the only provision for indoor ball games will go too.\nThe Governing Body of IC has accepted that the\nprovision of indoor sports facilities at South\nKensington is a priority. Research is under way into\nthe feasibility of building a new sports hall on site,\nprobably financed by the income from the gravel\nbeing dug out of the sports ground at Harlington\n(this money being specifically reserved for student\nfacilities at South Kensington).\n8. Welfare Senice Developments\nThe Welfare Advice Service has been in limbo\nfor most of this year, after the disbanding of the\nStudent Services Office. The sen ice now appears\nto be taking shape, based on the first floor of 15\nPrince's Gardens: the Accommodation Office at the\nfront. Welfare Centre in the middle, and Student\nCouncellor at the back forming a comprehensive\nadvice service on a range of topics. I have been\ninvolved in discussions at all stages in the reorganisation and in selecting the new Welfare\nAdvisor: and I am confident that the re-vamped\nservice will be a successful and useful one\n9. Overseas Students Welcome Day\nThis year for the first time ICU. with Lesley\nGillingham. organised a 'welcome day' for new\noverseas students the day before Autumn term\nstarted. This was based in the Union Building and\ninvolved introductions to welfare staff, free lunch\nand a guided tour. Although reminiscent of (only\nslightly) organised chaos, it seemed successful and\nenjoyable. So much so that the College have\nabandoned their usual reception for overseas\nstudents, and are instead prepared to collaborate\non, and underwrite costs of, this event every year.\nI felt it was a major success and hope it will continue\nto be so.\n10. Lesbian and Gay Welfare\nThe issue of prejudice against lesbians and gay\nmen at IC has always concerned me and I was\npleased to bring it out into the open. Although it\nhas led to much abuse both of me and others who\nhave supported the rights of gay people to be open\nabout their sexuality, it seems to have been a positive move. Robert Daniel was co-opted to\nCouncil and publicised issues and events\neffectively. There is now the backbone of an active\nGay Society which should continue its work next\nyear. Fear and prejudice at Imperial College seem\nto be on the decrease\u2014perhaps we're moving out\nof the dark ages at last.\nThanks to Robert and to Andy Bannister for all\nyour work on this issue\u2014and no thanks at all to\nall those who spread childish rumours when it was\nreally nothing to do with you!!\n11. AIDS Campaign\nWith the backing of a UGM I managed to get\nmany people around College involved in a major\nAIDS information campaign which is currently\nunder way. I have also secured College's financial\nbacking for the project. Unfortunately this\ncampaign will need to be carried on as the AIDS\nproblem won't go away, but at least I feel we've\nmade a start. I have also received a firm assurance\nfrom the Rector that there will be no discrimination\nagainst any student or staff member who contracts\nthe AIDS virus.\n12. Developments at Silwood Park\nMajor problems and grievances at Silwood Park\nhave been brought to light in the course of events\nthere. The development of the new Technology\nTransfer Centre or 'Science Park' on site there has\nhighlighted the shaky hold students have on their\nfacilities; and the selling of Sandyride\u2014residence\nfor several overseas families\u2014has brought attention\nto the accommodation problem there.\nThe small number of students based at Silwood\nmay have beautiful surroundings and a close-knit\ncommunity, but they lack the accommodation and\nwelfare resources and many of the facilities that\nwe at South Kensington take for granted.\nOne of my regrets about this year is the failure\nof plans to form closer social links with Silwood.\nHowever we have tried to put forward the views\nof Silwood students on the issues of facilities and\naccommodation at the highest levels in College:\nwith some success.\nCollege Committees\n1. Introduction\nFor brevity's sake I shall not go into detail on\nall those I have attended. I shall list them, with brief\nnotes where appropriate.\nThe major issues of the year have been, without\ndoubt, the St Mary's merger, the student\naccommodation problem and refectory\nrefurbishment'JCR problem. These have cropped\nup again and again on administrative, academic and\nwelfare committees. The inefficiency of the\ncommittee sy tem is demonstrated only too well as\nthe same arguments are regurgitated yet again in\ndifferent settings\u2014of course this is one of the perils\nof sitting on such a wide range of committees!\nCertainly my view that committee meetings contain\n1 hour of waffle for 10 minutes of useful business\nhas proved correct.\nOne the whole the Union representatives on\nCollege committees have used their positions well;\nthe student viewpoint has been put forcibly and.\ngenerally, effectively.\n2. Governing Body and Finance and Executive\nCommittees\nThe main decision makers of the College; Union\nrepresentatives are technically only observers but\nhave spoken out whenever appropriate. Although\nthese bodies have representatives from many\next enal organisations there is no real representation\nof non-academic staff which leads to unbalanced\nviews of, for instance, job cuts proposals.\n3. House Committee and its Sub-Groups\n(i) House: reports to the Governors on\nspace/building/maintenance aspects of College and\nco-ordinates and approves work of the following.\n(ii) Catering and Conference Services Management:\nhas been obsessed with refectory\nrefurbishment/JCR. Otherwise is often hampered\nby clashes between refectories and conference\noffice.\nRefectory Users: similarly obsessed, a frequent\nand often trivial committee.\n(iii) Student Residence: has yet to discuss next\nyear's rents; has been most concerned with need\nfor new places and refurbishment of existing stock.\nWardens sub-committee: deals with finer details\nof residences; often tends towards pettiness and\ntrivial bickering.\nSecurity Working Groups: has achieved some\nreal results with Southside and Linstead\u2014and\nhopefully soon with Beit Hall.\n4. Academic Committees\n(i) Board of Studies: a huge gathering of all\nprofessors and other academics to discuss all\nacademic and related matters and to co-ordinate and\napprove work of following:\n(ii) Graduate Studies: deals with all aspects of\npost-graduate teaching and supervision. Spends\nmuch time reviewing courses in detail\u2014a very\nuseful input into new and evolving course\nstructures.\n(iii) Undergraduate Studies: without doubt one\nof the best and most effective College Committees.\nThis tackles the problems of teaching, student\nworkload and course design on all undergraduate\ncourses. I believe this group will bring about major\nchanges for the better although they will be slow.\nAs well as those below, major areas of work have\nbeen: staff training for teaching, teaching of study\nskills, assessment and control of student workloads.\n(iv) Teaching Evaluations Working Group: has\ndeveloped a College-wide student questionnaire\nconcentrating on teaching rather than course\ncontent\u2014this is currently on a trial run. Other\nassessment methods are to be introduced, aiming\nfor a College-wide evaluation/credit scheme for\ngood teaching.\n(v) Course Review Working Group: has\ndeveloped a system for assessing new and existing\ncourses including scrutiny of workload/assessment/\nteaching methods as well as academic content.\n(vi) Engineering Course Units Working Group:\nCourse Units have been suggested as a means of\nreducing the engineering department's high failure\nrates. It seems unlikely that any progress towards\ncourse units will be achieved due to intransigent\nattitude of many engineering academics. Other\nbenefits of CUs could be broadening of courses and\nscope for study options in other colleges of the\nuniversity.\n5. Athletics Committees\n(i) Athletics and Athletics Grounds: have been\ngreatly concerned with Harlington gravel extraction\nand the spending of the resulting money on a sports\nhall. I have regularly expressed concern that the\nUnion should be able to keep track of the income,\nwhich goes into trust to be spent on student facilities\nwith Governors' approval. This will need to be\nclosely watched next year. Also discussed was the\npossibility of an 'Astroturf pitch at Harlington\u2014a very useful and potentially lucrative idea well-received by College but still in its infancy.\n(ii) Sports Hall Working Group: to be of useful\ncompetition size the Hall must be huge and hence\nboth costly and difficult to site. However this group\nappears to have made real progress and a feasibility\nstudy is now being undertaken on a Prince's Gardens site.\n6. Welfare and Related Committees\n(i) Student Welfare: meets infrequently\u2014rather\na 'talking-shop' as welfare issues are generally dealt\nwith directly. Main concern has, again, been\nstudent ac com md ation needs.\n(ii) Overseas Students: this also meets\ninfrequently and covers two areas: both recruitment\nand welfare of overseas students; un surprisingly accommodation has again featured highly as an\nissue for concern. Whilst College is so desperate\nto gain extra fee income recruitment is bound to\nbe of highest priority; although it is recognised that\nlack of welfare back-up will be detrimental to\nrecruitment in the long run, it is often up to the\nUnion representatives on this committee to ensure\nthat welfare issues are thoroughly considered.\nThe Union and its\nCommittees\n1. UGMs\nThese have, as ever, been badly attended. I take\npartial responsibility for this, for failing to ensure\na well-coordinated publicity campaign in advance\nof each one. Two UGMs\u2014the 'Tie Club Motion'\nin November and the emergency meeting in the JCR\nshowed that it is possible to have serious,\nconstructive debate at quo rate general meetings.\nUnfortunately the 'Big Issues' aren't always there\nfor discussion and the Exec can't invent them all\nthe time. However, good advance publicity is\npossible, time-consuming as it is; this is an area\nwhere we have failed on several occasions, largely\ndue toi unfortunate circumstances and overwork of\nthe people concerned.\n2. Council\nThese meetings have generally been short and\nfruitful. I have been worried sometimes by the lack\nof debate on serious issues and the lack of reports\nAnnual Reports 2\n\n"

    "content": "Editorial FELIX, Friday May 15th19874 In with the new\nDespite Ian Howgate's ability to irritate\na lot of people, he was in many respects\nthe most suitable candidate in the\npresidential election. His experience and\nknowledge of Union affairs were at least\nas good as any of his rivals, and he was\nwithout doubt the most conscientious\nand dedicated. Nevertheless the news of\nhis election was not considered good\ncause for cracking open another case of\nsherry in the Union Office on\nWednesday night. Too many Union\nofficers have, rightly or wrongly, treated\nhim with extreme cynicism this year. It\nis easy to agree with them after sitting\nthrough an average session of ICU\nCouncil, during which his opinion is\nheard on every subject, whether or not\nhe has any opinion to express, or even\nany knowledge of the issues.\nIan has done some useful work for the\nUnion, particularly on Residences,\nduring his time at College. His\nweaknesses are his tendency to overreact\nto many situations, and, frankly, his\nknack for rubbing people up the wrong\nway. This not all bad news; his pushy\nattitude will prevent there being another\n'silent president' on College committees\nand. if his enthusiasm lasts, he should\nnot tire of the more testing aspects of\nthe job. He has the ability, but not the\ntemperament.\nNow that we know who all the\nsabbaticals and Executive officers for\n1986/87 it is hard to be hopeful for next\nyear. If Ian is irritating, Alan Rose is\nthe most caustic Union officer we have\nhad for years. He has experience of the\nUnion, but I can think of little to\nrecommend him. Alan likes nothing\nbetter than to sit in the Union Bar all\nnight, trading cynical quips with anyone\nelse who find themselves propped up\nagainst the counter. His decision to\npropose one of the candidates in the\npresidential election was both\nirresponsible, and a measure of his\ninflated ego. While Ian rushes round\nmaking everybody's life difficult, Alan\nwill be downing another pint, sitting\nback, taking life easily and telling\nhimself how well he is doing.\nChas Jackson is a much more amiable\ncharacter than either of his colleagues\nand will no doubt do well in his job as\nHon Sec. Unfortunately I do not think\nhe will be interested in exerting much\nof an influence on the Executive as a whole.\nMore on Gay News\nAt last we appear to have stimulated\nsome thoughtful discussion of the\ngay/lesbian issue; there are two letters\nprinted on page 2, which are at least,\ninteresting reading. I shall be happy to\nprint further correspondence on the\nsubject.\nAn Apology\nincluded or not, then they must be\nreferred to me directly. What gets\nprinted in FELIX is ultimately my\nresponsibility and I will not have\nmembers of the student staff questioned\nupon the origin of any material.

    "content": "Annual Reports\nPresident\nIntroduction\nIt is impossible to cover everything that has\nhappened this year\u2014unexpected and routine\u2014\nwithout writing a telephone directory! In this report\nI shall attempt to cover the outstanding issues along\nwith the main routine business which has occupied\nmy time.\nThe year has in many ways been extremely\nsuccessful; but the Union has had its shortcomings.\nA criticism which has been levelled yet again is that\nthe Union is too introverted and that its officers have\nnot spent enough time amongst the students finding\nout what they want, or, on the other hand,\npublic ising national student issues to its members.\nThis is not how I would have wished things to be,\nbut unfortunately the Union has, in recent years,\ngrown in its activities so that the current\nstaff/sabbatical structure is no longer able to cope\nwith all the administration plus all the outgoing,\nforward-thinking things sabbaticals are supposed\nto do. Inevitably the latter functions suffer;\nhopefully the imminent reorganisation will reduce\nthis problem and will give the sabbaticals much\nmore time to develop a higher social/public profile.\nThis year has seen further attacks on the funding\nof the universities system: students have become\neven worse off with the reduction in state benefits\navailable to them; and universities across the\ncountry have suffered drastic cuts in income from\nthe University Grants Committee. In spite of\nImperial's continued high academic ratings the\nCollege has lost its privileged highly funded\nposition and now faces a \u00a33m deficit. This fact has\nhung over all talks of merging, increasing student\nmembers, increasing research commitments and\ncutting 100 jobs in College. Given this bleak\ncontext\u2014in which improvements to student welfare\nwould seem unlikely\u2014there have been a surprising\nnumber of positive steps forward this year; although\nthe future continues to look fairly grim\u2014much\ndepends on the result of the forthcoming general\nelection and it is not difficult to see which way that\nis likely to lead.\nMy summary of this year, then: the beginning\nof an essential period of change of organisation and\noutlook both for the students' Union and for the\nCollege as a whole. I wish all concerned the best\nof luck for carrying on with these changes over the\ncoming years.\nMajor Issues and\nDevelopments\n/. St Mary's Merger\nOne of the most radical proposals to hit IC in many\nyears was that of merging with St Mary's Hospital\nMedical School. It now looks likely that the merge\nwill go ahead despite vociferous opposition from\nthe more conservative academics who feel that it\nwill ir redeem ably alter the nature of Imperial\nCollege\u2014personally I would see this as a change\nfor the better. Much research has been done by the\nCollege into the financial effects of the merge and\ngiven that these are likely to be advantageous the\nwhole idea appears to be a good one, both\nacademically (especially in the long term) and\nsocially. St Mary's would be taken in as a fourth\nconstituent college; its effects would probably not\nbe felt by most students at IC, or indeed at\nPaddington, except in so far as new, broader\ncourses with medical content\u2014and more medical-based research\u2014are developed.\nJackie and I have been involved in many talks\nregarding Student Unions and facilities after amer pe. Any conclusions we have reached this year\nare recommendations only, and it will be up to next\nyear's Exec to sort out the nitty-gritty. There will\nbe problems, mainly those of financing a previously\nautonomous Union through an established central\nsy tem and of achieving effective integration of the\nsecond site into Union affairs\u2014but it is felt that,\nin the event of the merge, these will be\nsurmountable and possibly outweighed by the\nbenefits of increased facilities and social mixing.\nThe St Mary's Union reps have been extremely\npositive and helpful even though faced by the\ndaunting proposition of being 'swallowed' by the\nmuch larger Imperial College.\n2. The Junior Common Room\nThis has been the major bone of contention this year\nas College backed out on their original plan to swap\nround the dining room and JCR in Sherfield\u2014\nleaving us with a College-run burger bar in the\ncorner of 'our' room. After the highly successful\nweek-long boycott of 'QT' the Union's points about\ncontrol of Union space and conference income were\ntaken seriously, and there now ? . -ars to be a solution in sight. The College has agreed to give\nus money to compensate for loss of income from\nconferences\u2014apart from any other increase to the\nsub vent ion \u2014and is committed to finding a new\nspace where the Union can have complete control\nof management and bar/catering facilities, suitable\nfor large functions. This commitment is\nincorporated in the reviewed College plan and\nseems a good idea as the current JCR is obviously\ndestined to become purely refectory space in the\nlong term.\n3. Office Reorganisation\nThe Union has been struggling this year under\nthe huge workload caused by catering and bar\nfinances\u2014on top of all the other functions which\nour staff were originally employed to carry out.\nThis problem will be alleviated with the\nappointment of a finance officer\u2014approved by the\nCollege on top of our normal expenditure. At the\nsame time the Union Office will probably need to\nexpand into the Upper Lounge. (See section 5).\nThe Union Office computers are now running\nwith Pat being trained in word-processing. An\naccounts system and data-handling packages will\nbe developed over the summer in conjunction with\nthe new officer and current staff.\nMy thanks to the planning sub-group on Union\norganisation, led by Hugh Southey. for the\nrecommendations on reorganisation; and to Chris\nMartin for sorting out the mess of computer bits\nwhich I inherited when 1 took office.\n4. Bar and Catering\nAt the start of the year a lot of work had to be\ndone on getting the Union Bar and 'Norman's' into\nshape. The Bar now has its own licence, held by\nJen Hardy-Smith and Bob Schroter on our behalf.\n'Norman's' was completely refurbished on a very\nlimited budget; and Kevin Buckley was appointed\nbar manager, assisted by Sean Davis. For the first\ntime the Lounge Bar was opened regularly and\nmeals were served in the evenings from the\nSnackbar, which was also open over Easter.\nAlthough both bar and Snackbar have had their\nquiet periods, on average they have traded very well\nand provided a good, cheap service. Thanks are\ndue to all the staff and Bob Schroter (Bar senior\ntreasurer) for am king our expanded services a success.\n5. Union Building\nThe Union Building is in quite a mess, a fact\nwhich is widely recognised. By the end of this year\na comprehensive plan for refurbishment will have\nbeen agreed with the College; Mr Smith has agreed\nto increase the Union's budget by a specified\namount for refurbishment and maintenance. This\nwould include such work as altering the office and\nupgrading/redecorating and finishing rooms and\nstairways. A substantial expenditure is necessary\nto stop the building deteriorating further and this\nwill probably be ma tie available; it will be up to\nfuture sabbaticals to ensure that it is wisely spent.\nMy thanks to Pete Higgs and his working group\nfor their ideas on the Union Building refurbishment.\n6. Residence Developments\nOver the year many new hall and house wardens,\nsub wardens and managers have been appointed. I have been involved in all the interviews for these\nposts and on the whole the choices seemed to be\nwise ones.\nThe projected increase in student numbers has\nplaced a huge strain on residence places resulting\nin the unfortunate cut in places for re-applicants.\nNegotiations for 200 new places in Evelyn Gardens\nhave given new hope; if acquired these may have\nto be financed partially through across-the-board\nrent increase. This is an unfortunate but necessary\nmeasure if the money cannot be found elsewhere,\nas a chance to acquire such good accommodation\nmay never happen again.\nFinances for student accommodation will always\nbe a problem as long as the UGC regulations\u2014\npreventing the College spending public funds on\naccommodation\u2014apply. It is one area where I do\nfeel every effort is being made by the College as\nthe accommodation problem (and its effect on\nrecruitment) is widely appreciated. Several new\nschemes such as self-funding acquisition of houses\nfurther away from College have been suggested and\nthe long-term objective (as stated in the reviewed\nCollege plan) is to increase the residence places by\n1000. Planning application has been made for a new\nhall of residence to be built over the Sports Centre\nin Prince's Gardens but it is very difficult to see\nwhere the money could be found.\n7.

    "content": "as NUS have had their hands full this year\ncampaigning against the further barbaric cuts to the\neducation system and to student support.\nFurthermore, it seems from the dissatisfaction\nwithin affiliated colleges that this has been a poor\nyear for the NUS in terms of its own administration\nand personalities.\nI believe that an affiliation campaign this year\nwould have failed. However 1 for one end the year\nas I began\u2014committed to the principle of a National\nUnion of Students and aw are of the fact that ICU\nmisses a lot by not being affiliated, and above all\naware that we will never change the NUS from the\noutside.\nCampus Trade Unions\n1 have tried to build up a good relationship this\nv ear with the IC trades unions (the main ones being\nASTMS. ALT. NALGO and NUPE) and have\nattended the Joint Trades Unions Committee\nmeetings. This relationship is a valuable one as our\ninterests generally coincide and mutual support can\nbe extreme h useful\u2014for instance this year on the\n\"QT\" boycotts and the AIDS campaign. I hope that\nnext year's sabbaticals will strive to keep up this\ngood relationship.\nWorld University Service\nThis is a charity in which ICU is affiliated, it aims\nto sponsor students from disadvantaged parts of the\nworld through degree courses. Backed by a UGM\ndecision I am investigating the different types of\nscholarship schemes operated and hope to set one\nin motion before I leave. The Rector has agreed\nin principle to waiving fees for a student, whose\nmaintenance costs would be paid for by staff/student\nfundraising. If fundraising starts next year the first\nsuch student could come to IC in October 1988.\nIraqi Students\nI have become involved this year in the struggle\nby Iraqi students at IC\u2014and throughout Britain\u2014\nfor their right to study peacefully without\nintervention from their government. I have been\namazed by the pressures put upon these students\nb\\ their embassy, other Iraqis and other\norganisations\u2014aimed at monitoring their behaviour\nhere and eventually at forcing them back to Iraq\nto join the Iraq/Iran war. Iranian students are\nsubjected to very similar pressures.\nThis issue has received considerable media\nattention this year; I hope this will continue and\nthat ICU will carry on supporting its Iraqi and\nIranian students in any way possible.\nConclusion\nThis has been an enjoyable, rewarding but also\nfrustrating year. In many senses the Union has been\na success\u2014its activities and services have\nprospered, it has moved forward in attitude and\npolicy and it has improved its standing with the\nstudents and staff of IC as well as with other\nstudents' unions. I feel I have achieved several\nobjectives although by no means as many as I had\nhoped for!\nIt has been marvellous to know that when\nsomething needed doing, there was a small reliable\ngroup of people always ready to help out. To those\npeople, and to all those students and staff who have\nco-operated, got involved and generally been\nhelpful, many thanks.\nVery Special Thanks\nTo Jen. Pat and Kathy. who have worked\nunbelievably hard and have been wonderful to share\nan office with. It's impossible to thank them enough\nfor guiding their wayward sabbaticals through the\npitfalls of the year.\nAnd to Jackie and Dave, who started the year\nas virtual strangers to me and ended up as great\nfriends. I think they've done brilliant jobs and as\na team we've really got on.\nAll in all, this year has sometimes been\nfrustrating\u2014but wherever I work in the future, I can't imagine ever getting as much fun out of a job\nas I have from this one. I wish Alan, Chas and my\nmysterious successor the best of luck and hope that\nthey will be able to say the same in a year's time.\nChristine Taig\nDeputy\nPresident\nThank you for at least reading the introduction to\nmy report. I'm sorry it's so long but it's too late\nfor me to cut it now. If nothing else, read the\nsections that interest you, but I would advise you\nto try and read it all as I'm probably rude to you\nat least once.\nUnion Premises\nOne of the most depressing aspects of this job,\nhas been to come into work in the Union Building\nknowing that, 10 months after starting work, it is,\napart from a few bright spots, in the same awful\nstate as when I started. This stems partly from a lack of time to commit to the task in hand, but\nmostly it seems caused by a hardened intent, by\na large number of students, to turn it into a pig sty.\nA heartfelt thanks to all those who've vomited on\nthe stairs, nicked all the chairs, carved in the tables,\nwritten on the walls and splashed Guinness on the\nceiling!\nSome of the things that, rightly or wrongly, been\nachieved are the refurbishment of the snack bar and\nthe moving of FELIX and Ents offices. We also\nput de odo risers in the gents toilets, and had some\nof the lighting rewired. College maintenance\nsection, has, for the most part, been very helpful,\nalthough occasionally painfully slow. The majority\nof defects reported have been broken windows or\nfaulty plumbing. The latter is likely to become more\nand more of a problem given the age of most of it.\nThe cleaners have, as always, shown tremendous\nresilience and patience. Responsibility for them,\ntogether with financial remuneration, was devolved\nto the departments, including the Union, last\nAugust. The arrangement has worked well so far,\nalthough it is an extra responsibility that I felt I could have managed without.\nElsewhere around the College there have been\na few problems with the gyms. At the start of the\nyear the volleyball court, very old and definitely\nnot purpose built, was so run down that its use was\nbecoming dangerous. Eventually leaking roofs, pot-holed floors and broken lights were patched up, but\nfrom this point of view alone, promises of a new\nsports hall came not a moment too soon. And in\nSouthside the mews residents complained that\nKarate Club was shouting too loudly.\nBright spots on the horizon are the re-equip ing of the Union Dining Hall kitchen, and the almost\ncomplete refurbishment of the Union gym. Also,\nsubject to agreement with the College Secretary,\nthe Union should be getting its own budget for re-decoration of the building, rather than relying on\nthe whim of College maintenance section.\nRoom Bookings\nThe bane of my life. The problem of noise from\nthe Union Building aggravating neighbours has\nbeen particularly bad this year, especially as, now\nwe have taken on the bar licence, the police have\nbeen paying us quite close attention. Following the\nthreat of a noise abatement injunction from the\nEnvironmental Health Inspector, we (or I), clamped\ndown on loud late events and after-hours drinking.\nSome people, however, remain convinced that I'm only doing this to spite them and be a party pooper\n(my dear friends, the male only tie clubs, have\nrefined this to an art).\nRevenue from external bookings has increased\nthis >ear, by the use of rooms by local American\nColleges during week-day mornings and\nafternoons.\nAnnual Reports 4\n\n"

    "content": "Overseas Students\nThe term of office of the 1986/87 OSC executive\nstarted clumsily due to the inability of my\npredecessors to hand over office smoothly, in good\ntime and in good faith.\nIt was observed that there was no documentation,\nespecially as regards the offices of Chairman and\nSecretary. This has been corrected this session and\nall principal officers of the Committee do own files\nfor documentation purposes.\nReception of 1986/87 Freshers\nThe reception was a huge success. The reception\ndesk at Sheffield building, manned from the first\nweek of the session to the end of the second week\nof the session by the Committee, did a lot to help\nthe new students find their way within the College\nand some parts of London easily. The reception\n'party' organised jointly by the Students' Union and\nthe Welfare Centre was fantastic as it helped create\na welcome atmosphere to the Freshers in the\nCollege. May I use this avenue to thank those who\nhelped out especially at the reception desk.\nThis session, two major lines of policy were\npursued.\n1. Greater and wider social interac-tion/integration between the International groups.\n2. Increased presence of the International\nCommunity in the College\nThe first line of policy was pursued in two major\nways:\na) Encouragement of joint ventures between the\nNational Societies.\nb) Introduction of competitions between the\nNational Societies (Annual football competition).\nThe second line of policy was particularly\nfocussed on symposia which unfortunately featured\nduring the International week.\nInternational Week\nThe activities spread over a full week were held\nas against the usual one day event\u2014International\nEvening.\nThe week featured lectures, symposia, football\ncompetition and finally the International Nite.\nThe week started off very clumsily and rose to\npeak during the International Nite. Approximately,\n1500 people attended the Nite.\nThe International Cup donated by the College\nCommittee on Overseas Students was won by the\nCyprus Society. It is hoped that other societies will\nfight for and retain the cup in subsequent years.\nJose Molina\nOne of the saddest and most depressing moments\nof the committee was the tragic death of our\nTreasurer, Mr Jose Molina on March 9, 1987. Jose\nwas cremated on 16th March 1987 and on 18th March 1987 a memorial service was held at the\nHoly Trinity Church, Prince Consort Road, London\nin his honour. May his soul rest in peace. Jose had\nbeen the Treasurer of this committee for three years\n(sessions) at length. In recognition of his\ncontributions to the committee the International Cup\nwas renamed Jose Molina (International) Cup.\nMagazine Stall in Haldane Library\nThe acquisition of International magazines and\njournals from the different countries comprising the\nOSC had been initiated. The Indian High\nCommission had donated some books on Indian\nculture and art to start off the stall.\nThe acquisition project was handled by the late\nTreasurer and it is a bit difficult to sort out things\nnow. However, the budget for next session contains\na fixed amount for magazines. This implies that the\nwhole community will have magazines from\ndifferent parts of the world at their disposal for first\nhand information and news.\nFormation of New Societies\nThere had been moves to form two new societies:\nEgyptian and Iraqi Societies. I have since not heard\nanything from the proposer of the Iraqi Society.\nThe constitution of the Egyptian Society is\nawaiting ratification from the Council.\nFury of Overseas Students\nRecently, a group of students from the civil\nengineering department expressed their disgust and\nfrustration at the College through the pages of\nFELIX. With this kind of protest, it is very difficult\nto make any form of representations. I hope in\nfuture one will be able to channel grievances\nthrough the office of the chairman in strictest\nconfidence as this might yield very quick results.\nConclusion\nExcept for the sad incident, the session was good,\nsuccessful and full of new achievements.\nIni Urua\nPublications\nBoard\nIt has been a time for change in the Publications\nduring the year; involvement and commitment are\nstill very high and IC has a range and quality of\nPublications that few colleges can equal.\nFELIX have moved their office, changed both\npermanent staff and replaced both major pieces of\nequipment. Obviously this has caused problems\nwhile things settle down, but the hard work of the\neditor, Dave Jones, and many capable staff has\nmeant that we have continued to have a newspaper\nof which we can be proud, even if it did mean\nstaying up all night to produce it.\nThe other innovation for FELIX is the\narrangement where any profit that FELIX or the\nPrint Unit is able to make above their grant can\nbe put away for replacement of major equipment,\nthus relieving at least in part the strain on the Union\nequipment fund.\nIC Radio have continued to broadcast throughout\nthe year, with a new mixing desk and committee\nstructure. They still seem to have had some\nproblems in providing a daily news service,\nalthough this may change next year, and they are\nstill chasing the spectre of Community Radio which\nwould allow them to reach all the students at IC.\nSTOIC, the student TV service, have had a very\ndifficult year after being forced out of the College\nTV Studio before their Union studio was completed.\nThe Union has invested a large amount of money\nin STOIC and should start to see the return once\ntheir studio is completed for next year.\nThe Phoenix had its centenary this year, with\ncelebrations organised with many thanks to Dave\nRowe and Chris Edwards,. A very good Phoenix\nwas produced, but it Was felt that an Annual\nPublication was not the best way for it to serve its\npurpose. Next year it will be produced as a number\nof smaller regular editions, to be printed in-house\nand distributed with FELIX.\nTHE UG Handbook was produced and universally\nacclaimed, and next year I'm sure it will continue\nits success. Many thanks to the editor, Judith\nHackney.\nThe Alternative Prospectus for the first time was\nproduced on a bi-annual basis, to save money. This\nwas no thanks to a few narrow minded people who\nfelt that we should save even more by not producing\none at all, but wiser heads prevailed. This AP will\nserve for those entering in 88/89 and 89/90, and\nalthough there were strong reservations about the\nquality of the outside printing, it was produced\nunder budget by a sizeable amount. It would seem\nlike a good idea to put some of this money aside\nto produce an AP 'supplement' printed in-house\nnext year, especially with the Mary's Merger\nlooming. All thanks must go to the editor, Sunny\nBains.\nThe PG Handbook came out (eventually) and\nseemed well received by those it was aimed at\u2014\nfinal year undergraduates thinking about postgraduate courses here.\nIn general there have been a lot of changes, but\nmorale remains high and I have every confidence\nin the next year's editors' and committees' ability\nto expand and uphold the Publications here at IC.\nFinally, a few words of thanks are due, to Steve\nCook, the outgoing Senior Treasurer for all his hard\nwork, to Simon Langan for taking over so\nsmoothly, to Judith Hackney, James Southward,\nRichard Fincher and Nigel Whitfield in helping to\nrun the Board, and to the Union staff and\nsabbaticals; Jen, Kathy, Pat, Christine, Jackie and\nDave\u2014it's been a pleasure to work with you, and\nto anyone who has read, listened, helped and\nsupported the Publications throughout the year.\nThanks.\nChris Martin\nAnnual Reports 9\n\n"

    "content": "throwing things off the top of the building, to\ncleaning the floor afterwards. That is probably what\nwe should expect to do. What we shouldn't expect\nis students deliberately trying to undermine us, and\nbeing complete pains in the proverbial s! Freshers' Fair was another wacky occasion. I'm tempted to suggest that in future no planning goes\ninto it, as half the people set up stalls when and\nwhere they want anyway, and those that don't complain that they are being victimised by being\nput somewhere they don't want to be. I hope you\nall enjoyed it 'cos I didn't. Ents in General\nAccording to the DP's job description I'm responsible for overseeing the activities of the Ents\ncommittee. I gave up this responsibility after being\ninformed it was not my place to question what was\nin the contracts I was expected to counter-sign.\nChristine has been watching them ever since (she's better at it than I am anyway). Dan and I have often\nnot seen eye to eye.\nThe Saint Mary's HMS Merger\nThis seems now to be extremely likely to happen,\nthe mechanism appears to be proceeding with great\nhaste, and the dissenting voices seem too few and\ntoo late in the day.\nI was a member, along with Christine, of the\nworking party looking into student affairs\nconcerned with the merger. The opinion I reached\nwas that the merger would have some slight\npotential benefits for the Union and, provided that\nwhen the time comes we are particularly loud in\nsorting out our case, there should be no major\ndisadvantages. There is little point to my going into\ndetail on the possible future arrangements as 1) they\nare presented very well in the report of the working\nparty and 2) the eventual arrangements will all need\nto be accepted by a UGM later in the day anyway.\nI would briefly like to answer criticisms that\nChristine and I have kept the workings of this group\nsecret. Christine especially has gone to great length\nto publicise the form the discussions were taking\nand, anyway, the brief of the working party was\nto identify potential problems and indicate possible\navenues for solutions. With so woolly an agenda\nthe prospect of taking every single discussion point\nto an UGM was patently ridiculous.\nJunior Common Room\nThe battle for the JCR has been a long and bloody\ncampaign (ie I'm bloody fed up with it!). It was\nnotable for one thing: it caused an alarming\noutbreak of selective deafness: the 'College' didn't listen to the 'Union', half the students mis heard that\nit was a campaign against beefburger s, the 'Staff\ndidn't listen to anything until half way through the\nyear, and then were so busy listening to each other\nthat everyone else got fed up of waiting and carried\non without them, the 'Union' tried to listen to the\nstudent's answers but the questions kept changing,\nand 'refectories' didn't bother listening at all but\njust counted 'bums on seats'. And so at the end of\nthe day what has been achieved? A possible new\nJunior Common Room somewhere else, which may\nor may not be any good, but we'll have our own\nbar; a burger bar in slightly too big an aircraft\nhangar; a handsome-ish pay off for lost conference\nbookings. Is it a good solution? No idea. And we\nprobably won't know for a year either way.\nTelephones\nOn several occasions this year I have griped about\nabuse of Union phones, in particular the one in the\nGuilds office. At present we do not pay the bills\nfor our phones. Every other department of College\nis being told to cut its bills. If we are not seen to\nbe attempting the same then either we'll lose the\nautomatic external lines, or be forced to take on\nthe bills. Nobody expects that absolutely no private\ncalls will be made but there are limits to people's credulity.\nCamborne\nAnother thing I 've beefed a lot about this year\nis the bien nu al visitation of those delightful people\nfrom Camborne. I should like to go on record, once\nagain, that I believe that this event and similar ones,\nsuch as Cardiff Minex, should not be allowed to\ncarry on as present. I was disgusted not only by\ntheir behaviour, but by Council's pussyfooting\nresponse to it. As Deputy President, and main duty\nofficer, they have decided that I should expect to\nput up with verbal and physical abuse, stand by and\nwatch them vandalise the building, then calmly have\nit all put right afterwards. They also deemed that\nif College security failed to turn the Sherfield\nBuilding into a fortress then it was their own fault\nif Camborne get in and wreck some of the toilets.\nI felt this was Council at its most irresponsible.\nThankfully a UGM straw poll backed me up. I shall\ntry to avoid the temptation of coming back next year\nwhen Cardiff are here, and saying I told you so.\nULU\nI have not attended every General Union Council\nof ULU. At those I have, I have witnessed a great\ndeal of political posturing, but also a more positive,\neven aggressive, attitude towards issues dismissed\nby our UGMs as too political, which was at the\nvery least refreshing.\nI hope ULU does continue to be a focal point for\nthe University's Unions, and to provide the facilities\nwhich are so important for the smaller institutions.\nIt is a great shame the majority of our own students\nare too narrow-minded to consider that the 3R's campaign had any relevance to them.\nNational Student Services\nOrganisation\nThis is the relatively new body which has been\nestablished to take on the job of being the national\nstudents' union purchasing consortium. A year ago\nI attended its first AGM. I have not bothered to\ngo this year. For us to join would be extremely\nexpensive as we are not in NUS, but we have not\nsuffered yet from not being members. Nor do I expect that, in the for see able future, we shall be.\nSelf Defence\nThis year I have managed to arrange for two self-defence courses, provided free of charge by the\nSpecial Police Force, to be run for women students\nat IC. The difficulty in arranging these courses has\nbeen the high demand for them from companies.\nThe instructors are now booked up to 10 months\nin advance. Pippa Salmon, next year's Welfare\nAdvisor, has already had to contact them for a course next October (she will not be helped in this\nby the particularly poor record of attendance from\nIC students).\nHaving attended a course I can vouch that they\nare extremely useful and useable. However if we\nwish to continue this scheme it will need to be more\nregular and better attended. Otherwise we would\ndo better to use a commercial course.\nThis year the Union has distributed a rou d350 rape alarms to women students. I would hope that\nthe commitment to provide these free, to any\nwoman student wanting one, is maintained.\nAt the start of the year an attempt was made to\nprovide free lifts home, for women students in\nparticular, after late night events. It was used by\ntwo people only, then faded into oblivion. I find\nit difficult to believe that there are not women\nstudents who have problems getting home late at\nnight. It would probably be worth trying this at least\na few more times.\nBack to the subject of rape alarms, hopefully in\nthe next few months a fixed rape alarm will be fitted\nin the women's changing room in the Union gym.\nThe Year\nThis year has been quite a depressing one for me\ndiscovering that despite hard work I have achieved\nlittle of any importance or consequence. How the\npermanent staff cope with more than one year here\nis beyond me.\nThe reorganisation of the way the Union Office\nruns has been long overdue. Jen in particular has\nbecome so bogged down in finance work that she\nhas no time for any other admin. Hopefully the\nadvent of more staff will alleviate both some of her\nwork, and the DP's and Hon See's. Maybe we shall\nend up with sabbaticals taking decisions rather than\nattempting to cope with the day to day running of\nthe office.\nWe have, from time to time, been s lagged off\nfor not being sociable, not going to Rag events etc.\nI, for one, have almost entirely exhausted my\nsupply of enthusiasm for doing anything with\nstudents. I think it is probably a sound policy if I just turn up to deal with trouble or hassle someone\nto clear up the debris. If you consider this is not\nenough, then tough, because I'm only human.\nThe Thank You Bit\nJen, Pat and Kathy are very nearly due for\ncanonisation, or at the very least big sloppy kisses.\nThere are loads of College staff who have made\nthis year more productive or less arduous. I hope\nyou know who you are because this report is already\ntoo long to name you. Thank you anyway.\nChristine and Gutman have been excellent\ncolleagues this year. Christin has done a superb job\nof re sure c ting a credible face for the Union and\ngained us the respect of the College, Trade Unions\nand other SUs. Gutman has quite simply been\nGutman, which is more than enough for on\nsabbatical post.\nThat's it! nearly finished. Big raspberries to all\nthe real pains! and goodbye.\nJackie Peirce\nAnnual Reports 6\n\n"

    "content": "Sport FELIX, Friday May 15th19878 Boat Club Ghent Trip\nMaking waves\nAt the 9th International Belgian\nRowing Championships held in Ghent\nlast weekend, IC won one gold, two\nsilvers and a bronze medal against\nsome very tough international\ncompetition including national teams\nfrom Belgium, West Germany, Cuba,\nFrance, Portugal, Holland and\nMexico as well as many top crews\nfrom the UK.\nFollowing a short and\nuncomfortable nights sleep on Friday\nin a Belgian Army Barracks, IC\nmanaged to shrug off some of the\ntiredness and qualified for two of the\nafternoons finals. In the lightweight\ndouble skulls, the IC crew did not\nperform as well as they had hoped in\nthe final, losing the bronze medal to\nthe Belgians by some six feet. The\nopen cox less four did however\nperform better going a well deserved\nbronze medal in a high class field just\nbehind the German and French\nnational squad crews.\nOn Sunday, all the crews were\ndetermined to do even better and this\nwas proven right from the start when\nin the heats of the under 23 sculls,\nVince BA Roper came through in the\nlast 500 meters to get a place in the\nfinal. The lightweight double again\ndispelled any rumours that their\nnickname 'splash the crab' was true\nwhen they won their heat\ncomfortably. In the cox less fours, IC\nraced in both the open and under 23\nevents. Both crews made the finals,\nbeating off a lot of stiff competition\nfrom both the UK and abroad. As\nluck would have it, all four finals fell\nin the space of 45 minutes which\nmeant that our coach Bill 'super\ncyclist' Mason managed to cover\nsome 16km watching and\nencouraging each crew in the finals.\nIn the first of the IC finals, Vince\nRoper sculling in his boat 'Black\nAdder I' had a hard fought race from\nthe start and was lying 5th until half\nway before moving through in the last\n1000m with an 'Adder Burn' to take\na well deserved silver medal. In the\ndouble sculls, the IC crew although\nlying 4th with only 750m to go\nmanaged a sustained push to go\nthrough and win a silver behind the\nwinning Dutch crew. In the open\ncox less fours, IC were really up\nagainst it but they fought hard all the\nway finishing a very close 4th, under\none second off a medal winning time.\nThe Under 23 cox less four who are\nlooking for GB selection for the\nWorld Student Games led from start\nto finish in their race leaving both\nFrench and German Squad crews\ntrailing behind.\nThis gold medal rounded off a very\nsuccessful weekend for the Boat Club\nand gives good hope for all the crews\nwho raced all of whom are now\nlooking for international selection.\nOther good performances came\nfrom the dynamic single scull ers of\nK Steinlechner and JVB Towndrow.\nThe crews were:\nOpen (Sat) Under 23 (Sun)\n4\u2014J Walker, J Waller, G. Pooley and C Behrens\nOpen 4\u2014N Reynolds, H Michels, A McChesney and K Steinlechner.\nLightweight 2x \u2014S Pearson,\nR Gee\nWaterski Club\nMaking a splash\nAt last! After two terms disappointment, in which everything that\ncould possibly have gone wrong with\nthe boat did go wrong, we, the\nWaterski Club, are definitely back in\nfull operation. The boat's engine was\noverhauled before the beginning of\nterm, and last Wednesday 6 members\n(including a complete beginner) had\nthe lake to themselves and were able\nto ski all afternoon until dusk. We ski\nat Burghfield Aqua Sports Club (50\nminutes' drive from College), where\nwe have free use of changing rooms,\nshowers, clubhouse, slalom course\nand jump ramp. We have a Delta\nSport boat powered by a Ford 3-litre\nV6 inboard engine supplying 140 hp,\nand we organise trips every Tuesday,\nWednesday or any day of the week\nwhen there is enough interest. The\nClub possesses all the necessary\nequipment (skis, flotation jackets,\nwetsuits etc) and also provides some\nof the cheapest water skiing in Britain,\nso if you're at all interested, come\nalong to any of our meetings which\nare held every Monday at 12.30pm above Southside Bar. Alternatively,\ndrop me a line through the Elec Eng\npigeonholes.\nAlastair J Seymour\nSecretary, ICWSC\nHarrowing Day\nMaking fools of themselves\nOr \"How not to write a sports report\"\nOn Saturday May 9th, young\nmembers from the Institutions of\nCivil, Electrical and Mechanical\nEngineers competed at the Harrow\nSports Stadium for the prestigious\nYoung Trophy.\nThe most impressive team\nperformance came from the\nMechanical Engineering swimmers,\nmade up exclusively by Imperial\nCollege students. Team captain\n'Hector' Sullivan and newcomer\nAndy Law were unfortunate to lose\ntheir 100m freestyle races to Civil\nEngineers, though Hector recorded a new Institution best of 1 minute 9\nseconds. Fellow members 'Gismo'\nGoodsell and 'Pope' JP Hansen\u2014on\nloan from Vatican City\u2014won their\nraces convincingly, a particularly\ncreditable result for Gismo\nconsidering the strong opposition.\nThe consistent skill of these young\nswimmers was best seen in the relay,\nwhere they totally devastated their\nalready de moral is ed opponents, to\nwin by over two lengths. The event\nwould not have been complete\nwithout the traditional inspection of\nthe pool bottom by referee Fraggle\n'steady as a rock' Strawbridge.\nThe Mechanicals scored another\nnotable victory in the table tennis,\nthough the cricket, 5-a side,\nbadminton and squash events were\nwon by teams from the less well\nrespected branches of Engineering.\nOne of the most remarkable\nindividual performances of the day\ncame from another Imperial\nStudent\u2014Mechanical Engineer Basil\nHeaney\u2014in the squash event. Taking\ninto account the rigorous training that\nhe had undertaken in the Union\nLounge the night before, he lost his\nfirst match with a commendable 9-0,\n9-0, 9-0, and went on to score 9-2,\n9-2, 9-0 in his second.\nBy the end of the day, the\nMechanicals emerged as worthy,\noverall winners\u2014the third year in a row that they have done so. When\nasked to comment on their memorable\nvictory, 'Pope' JP said \"I wish there\nhad been a roller skating event,\nHarry\".\nSo what a day it's been for the\nYoung Mechanical Engineers,\nwinning the swimming, the table\ntennis, the Young Trophy and missing\nthe Rag Fete. And now over to Ron\nPickering in the swimming pool...\nBCSD\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion- FELIX, Friday May 15th1987 Apathy? Who cares':\nAn opinion article by Chris Martin? We've heard it all before\u2014candidate\nX promises to get more students\ninvolved in the Union, candidate Y, slightly less naive perhaps, promises\nto try and do something about it, but\nwarns that it will not change\novernight.\nThe symptoms are clear enough;\nonly 100-200 people attend a UGM,\nonly about 20% of the students bother\nto vote in sabbatical elections, which\nare frequently uncontested, and so on.\nAre Imperial students different from\nthose elsewhere? No! The only College\nin the University of London which has\nhave consistently large turnouts at\nUGMs is LSE (and we know what they\nare like!). It is not only a problem here.\nYet there are some conflicting signs.\nWhen the Union organises action (a boycott of the bar, or of QT) it gets\nalmost total support. University\nCollege sit in their Union Building; the\nSchool of Pharmacy get over aqua ter of their students out on a ULU \"50%\ncuts\" march. The message is clear:\nStudents are willing to back their\nunions on specific issues. The problem\ncomes when translating this into\ngeneral involvement.\nWe must face facts: the majority of\nstudents (or for that matter, members\nof any democratic organisation) are\nquite willing to let their union (or\nwhatever) to get on with representing\nthem. This may mean a lot of work\nfor those that do get involved, but they\ndon't care. The vast 'uninvolved' don't consider themselves badly off, they\nare doing very nicely thank you.\nThere are no 'burning issues' that\naffect them, they go through their life\nwith little hassle. They don't think they\nneed a union to defend their interests,\nor at least they don't think it will\ndisappear without them, so why\nshould they become involved? The\nirony is that the union is a victim of\nits own success, the better off the\nstudents think they are, the less they\nwill perceive the need for a union.\nThey are quite happy to continue the\n'status quo', why should they need a union to change it?\nThey are taking the attitude that the\nunion is doing little that interferes with\nthem, so why get involved? This is\neffectively a mandate for those\nrunning a union to do whatever they\nlike: if the majority really do object\nthey have the opportunity to attend\nUGMs, or whatever. This opportunity\nis what is important, and the UGMs\nmust continue.\nOf course these are vital issues that\nunions should campaign on; gay and\nlesbian rights, disabled rights, and the\nother liberation campaigns; grants,\nstudent loans and many others, but\nthey should not be surprised if the\ninvolvement from the masses is small.\nThe majority might not feel strongly\nenough to take part, but they don't object either; give those that are\ninterest the opportunity they need.\nOf course there are dangers, not\nleast that the general student\npopulation must know what the Union\nis doing on its behalf. That is one\nreason why an independent student\nmedia is so important. Meetings must\nbe open, accessible and as\nun intimidating as possible. Some kind\nof written guide to what may happen\n(like the NUS guide to their\nconference) available at every\nmeeting would be a good start.\nMeetings must be publicised properly,\nbut I'm certain that having only one\nUnion Publicity Officer (a job almost\nunique in it's lack of perks!), even with\nth'e best will in the world, cannot be\na good place to start.\nWe must accept that the majority of\nstudents are not interested in\nattending Union meetings for their\nown sake. Experience has shown that\nthey will turn up if an issue affects\nthem. We should stop wasting our\ntime worrying about UGM attendance\nand start worrying, for example, how\nwe keep our 'apolitical' status while\ncamp aig ing against a government\nintent on butchering Higher\nEducation.\nCOLLEGEBM T The printers9 tale\nI 've got a good job when I think about\nit. Like, I'm as good as self-employed. Printing's an odd trade you\nknow. Like you've got to have\nfriends, and if you haven't got the\nfriends you don't have the contacts\nand you'll never get anywhere. It's a shady world, dod gy deals with\ndod gy lads who know the trade like\nthe back of their hand. Caxton would\nhave been well out of his depth. Like\npamphleteers have given way to\nsharks who'd rip you off sooner than\nlook at you. So I do printing, I can\nhandle it. I do a few business cards,\nthe odd bit of publicity, nothing\nheavy, like I'm not even into colour\nin a big way.\nI get my regular fix each week on\nFelix, the bread and butter printing\nwhich pays the bills and not much\nmore. Like, it's hardly challenging.\nYou know the highlight of my week\nis getting my hands on some art\npaper, a new colour ink maybe, or\nperhaps getting my hands on the latest\nAustralian travel brochure.\nIt's travel I'm into at the moment,\nwith summer on the way, a chance to\nget away from it all, like. I 've seen\na little bit of the world already.\nAbsorbed the atmosphere in Europe\nyou know. It's all part of life's rich\npageant. Seeing things, getting to\nknow people, a really relaxed way to\nlive. It stands you in good stead for\nlater life. The days when I 'll be\nentirely my own boss, work for\nmyself, create what I want to create,\nmaybe write. I can picture myself on\nBondi Beach, book in hand, offset\nlitho slaving away beside me.\nFor the moment I sit in the print\nroom, my friendly machines working\naway, while I ponder the latest\npaperback. It's work I can tolerate,\nit doesn't intrude on my time a great\ndeal, and I'm free to be my own\nperson. The others don't see too much\nof me. I wander through in between\nmaking plates and occassionally I get\nvisits from the staff. We don't really\nhave a lot in common like. Like, I don't follow the student politics, and\ncan't see what all the fuss is about\nmost of the time, but they're nice\nenough people.\nWhat does get on my nerves is\nhaving to hang around until two\no 'clock in the morning waiting to\nprint the front page, and they're still\nin the office deciding what the lead\nstory's going to be. Like, if it gets that\nbad I bugger off and leave them to it.\nLike, its beyond the call of duty you\nknow.\nAnyway, like, I 'll be doing the job\nfor a while longer, until I save enough\nto set up on my own. Like, in the\nmeantime, if there's anyone wants\nsome business cards doing, like, I can\ngive you a good deal. After all, like,\nif you don't have the contacts you'll\nnever get anywhere.\n\n"
