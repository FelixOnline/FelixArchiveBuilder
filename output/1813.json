    "content": "Never has so much, by so many, been\nowed to so few. Churchill\u2019s words take\non a sinister new tone in light of the news\nabout Jeremy Hunt\u2019s financial statement\non Thursday. Independent observers\nhave declared that the UK is already in a\nrecession and things are going to get a lot\nworse before they get better. Journalist\nkeyboards around the country are\nwearing out from the number\nof times they are called upon\nto type \u201ca perfect storm\u201d or\n\u201cthe black hole of the nation\u2019s\nfinances\u201d.\nYet many are asking\nthemselves how we have\ngot here? How are we\nonce again the sick man\nof Europe, despite our\nyears of austerity, belt tightening\nand modest living? When will we\nget to enjoy the fat years?\nThe answer is never thanks to a unique\nBritish quirk. The oft quoted aphorism\nthat Britain want the public services of\nEurope and the taxes of the US gets us\nsome of the way to the explanation.\nHowever, we as a nation have become\nused to turning to the government to fix\nany inconvenience while also robbing the\ngovernment of the ability to affect change.\nWhen the pandemic locked us in our\nhomes, we expected to be able to return\nto our old jobs when the tide of infections\nreceded. The government provided money\ntobusinesses,nationalising,atastronomic\ncost,theeconomy.Whenworkfromhome\nended,manyofusreturnedtoouroldjobs.\nThisis,givenamoment\u2019sthoughtabizarre\nfact. Throughout history, there have only\nbeen two types of events that drive social\nmobility; war and disease. In each case,\nthe major upset has produced an attitude\namong peoples that the old world is gone\nand a new one must be created.\nCovid achieved nothing of the sort.\nInstead, we have returned to our pre-pandemiclives,muchpoorerasanation.A\nsimilarcallhasgoneoutthisyearasenergy\nprices have spiked for the government\nto protect people from the effects of the\nworld. To insulate the nation from any\ndisruption or disturbance. Some may\nclaim that this is the role of government,\nbut I could not disagree more.\nTo embrace this attitude is to fail, as a\nnation, the marshmallow test that asks\ntoddlers whether they would prefer a\nsingle marshmallow now or two in several\nminutes time. Designed to test the ability\nto delay gratification, it has, with caveats,\nbeen correlated to life success and future\nearning levels.\nTo ask for the government to fix all\nof our problems is to be permanently\ndisappointed as we ask the impossible\nand express outrage when it fails to\nmaterialise. Our leaders would become\nmanagers, making decisions about which\nservices to cut as the state\ncoffers slowly empty.\nIn 2010 then deputy\nPM Nick Clegg told\nreporters that he was\nagainst building more\nnuclear powerplants in\nthe UK because \u201cthey are\nexpensive\u201d and will only\ncome online \u201cin 2022\u201d.\nHow short sighted this view\nnow appears. However, there\nhas not been any culture change since\nthen. We should assume therefore that\nsimilar decisions about investment are\nbeing made now in Whitehall. In fact, we\ncan even see examples of it. Ex-minister\nEsther McVey has announced that she will\nonly support the raising of taxes if HS2 is\nscrapped.\nCrucially, I am neither claiming that\nwe should not borrow money, nor that\nwe should not try to live within our\nmeans. What I am instead calling for\nis a more energetic and independent\nminded spirit. We are all independent\nagents, capable of making decisions and\nsuffering misfortune. Our attitude to the\ngovernment should be as a recourse of last\nresortthatsitsinthebackgroundproviding\nservices such as education, healthcare\nand law. We as free citizens should be the\nchange that we wish to see in the world.\nOneofthemajorunreportedfactorsinthe\ndiscussion around government spending\nis the offloading of services that used\nto be provided by civil society onto the\ngovernment. Where civic organisations\nused to provide philanthropic services,\nsociety and provide meaning to much\nof life, lots of modern British civic life\nresembles a barren desert as people\nabandon collective organisation. I call\non you, any reader of this article, go out\nand look for an organisation to join. This\ncould be a campaign, association, church\nor even a book group. Maybe even a\nstudent society committee. However, the\nimpact you cause will be paid back with\ndividends by the people who benefit from\nyour labour.

In February 2021, the\nPnaC and local district government\nlaunched AI-powered surveillance to\ndetect problems and potential hazards\nat Shanghai\u2019s Nanjing Building. For\nexample, a visitor opening a window to\ntake a picture may be flagged, due to the\nrisk of the phone falling out the window.\nInJune2021,theChinesegovernment\npassed a policy to create a \u201cModern\nSocialism Pilot Zone\u201d within Pudong\nwith its own legislative powers, with the\nstated aim of making the region a high-tech hub, with a focus on AI.\nChinese state surveillance has\nattracted international backlash due to\nits suspected use in persecution of the\nUyghur Muslim minority in Xinjiang\nprovince. More recently, internal unrest\nhas resulted from China\u2019s far-reaching\nZero Covid policy, which enforces\nstrict lockdowns over vast swathes of\nthe Chinese population in response to\nsuspected and detected Covid cases.\nTo travel between cities, citizens\nmust have a \u201cgreen\u201d health code, which\nindicates that they are up to date on\nvaccinations, have had negative PCR\ntest results, and have not been in\ncontact with infectious patients.\nManual checking of these codes\nhasledtoseveredelays.Electronic\nchecking by machines has been\ndeveloped and implemented in\nsome public areas.

However, thousands of customers\nfrom rural areas found they were unable\nto withdraw cash from, or use, their\naccounts. Groups of angry customers\nattempted to travel to protest at the\ncentral bank headquarters in the Henan\nprovince, but some found that their\nhealth codes turned red as they arrived,\nor while they were at a protest. Up to\n200 depositors reported this issue while\nthey made plans to attend the protest.\nSome depositors said they were able to\ntravel to Zhengzhou, Henan, by public\ntransport, but their codes turned red at\nthe city gates. These circumstances have\nled citizens to claim that dissent is being\nsilenced through the use of electronic\nsentries and health codes.\nAn Imperial College London\nspokesperson said: \u201cAll partnerships\nand collaborations at Imperial undergo\nthorough scrutiny and are regularly\nreviewed, working closely and regularly\nwith the appropriate Government\ndepartments.\u201d\nFelix contacted Corerain to ask\nwhy all mention of their cofounder was removed from\nthe website, but has not yet\nreceived a reply.\nis participating in national striking on\n24th, 25th and 30th November.\nAdditionally, Imperial UCU\nmembers are going to be taking Action\nShort of a Strike (ASOS) from 23rd\nNovember until 20th April, when their\nmandate is due to end.\nASOS involves:\n- working to contract,\n- not covering for absent colleagues,\n- removing uploaded materials related\nto, and/or sharing materials related to,\nlectures or classes that will be or have\nbeencancelledasaresultofstrikeaction,\n- not rescheduling lectures or classes\ncancelled due to strike action,\n- not undertaking any voluntary\nactivities\nIn their guidance for students, the\nCollege seeks to reassure students on\nassessments, stating \u201cYou will not be\nexamined on any content which you\nhave not been taught as a result of strike\naction. If necessary, assessments will be\nadjusted to take into account the impact\nof the strike on teaching.\u201d\nThe Union Council was not voting on\ntheir stance on Imperial UCU\u2019s ASOS\nplans between this November and April.\nThe Union President called an\nEmergency Union Council meeting for\nthe 22nd of November, 6-7pm, with a\nsinglepaperontheagenda,titled:Union\nStance on UCU Industrial Action.\nThis paper authored by the Union\nPresident and Deputy President of\nEducation proposed voting on three\nresolutions:\n1.

Just a\nquick listen to their most popular track on Spotify,\n\u2018Hopp\u00edpolla\u2019, gives you a pretty good idea; it might\njust be one of the most delightful and happy tracks\nyou can find on the platform. I find it a wonderful\nbreak from some of\nthe more bleak music I like to listen to\non a daily basis, but\neven I will concede\nthat it\u2019s not something a lot of people\nI know would shell\nout \u00a350 to witness\nlive.\nNevertheless, on\na chilly evening in\nBrixton I shuffled\ninto an Apollo filled\nto the brim with\nmiddle-aged J\u00f3nsi\n(the impressive vocalist and lead guitarist) enjoyers,\nalongside young professionals in suits (there after\nwork) and mums and dads looking for something\ndifferent to Coldplay. It was a pretty stark contrast\nto the Godspeed You! Black Emperor concert in\nBerlin that I experienced just over a month earlier,\ndespite both bands technically falling under the same\numbrella of post-rock. I almost felt out of place in my\nshirt from that concert \u2014 the front of which is simply\na picture of 3 canisters of tear gas with the caption \u201cA\nState\u2019s Embrace\u201d. Suffice to say that whilst I was happy\nexperiencing the music in my own way: moving,\ndancing,evenheadbangingtosomeofthesignificantly\nhardersongs,theagefifty-somethinggentlemanonmy\nleft didn\u2019t make any movements beyond a polite clap\nat the end of each song.\nWhere some bands will make a point of playing a\nconsiderablymorevariedselectionoftheirdiscography,\nas well as teasing material from upcoming albums,\nSigur R\u00f3s played the hits.

A couple of rows ahead of me, when the drums\nof \u2018N\u00fd batter\u00ed\u2019 kicked in, a guy started jumping and fist-pumping in excitement. More so than anything else,\nthough, the band played tracks from () [Pronounced\n\u2018Untitled\u2019, I\u2019ve been told] which they recently released\na 20th anniversary edition of. Alhough I do wish they\u2019d\ngiven Kveikur a bit more love (they only played the\ntitle track) there was plenty to enjoy in the little-over\ntwo hours they were on stage that evening.\nI did have a good time \u2014 but I can\u2019t help feeling\nthat what my flatmate and fellow post-rock aficionado\nAriel prophsied came true. Whilst the music was great,\nthere isn\u2019t enough in the\nband\u2019s catalogue to make\na show of it. A solid\n80% of the time, I stood\npretty stationary, looking\nforward with my arms\nfolded. It was almost\nthe same experience as\nlistening to Sigur R\u00f3s\nat home, except loud\nand live. Yes, you could\nsee J\u00f3nsi with his cello\nbow playing the guitar,\nwatch him sing with that\nincrediblefalsetto,before\nrunning around the stage,\nyelling, and even more vigorously attacking his guitar\nwith the cello bow .

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n6\nThe Tate Modern EY Exhibition on Paul Cezanne\u2019s\nlife explores the evolution of his painting style\nthroughout the decades. He was one of the foremost\npainters of the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist\nmovements. The exhibition, organised by Tate Modern\nand the Art Institute of Chicago, meanders from his\nmore rustic beginnings to him finding his footing as a\nParisian artist in times of political upheaval and artistic\nrevolution. A veritable feast for the eyes, and bringing\nin works never-before-seen in the UK, the exhibition\nattempts to recontextualize Cezanne\u2019s work around\nkeyaspectsofhislife\u2013bethathispoliticalopinions,his\nrelationship with his family, and his friendships with\nother important figures of late 19th century France,\nsuch as the fellow Impressionist painter Camille Pissarro, and the novelist \u00c9mile Zola.\nThe exhibition makes for an interesting and\nwell-structured tour through Cezanne\u2019s work. Starting\nby investigating the influence that his relationships and\nthe times he lived in had over his oeuvre, it then transitions to an exploration of various themes that crop\nup throughout his paintings \u2013 namely still lifes, land-scapes, and the bathers. It sets out not just to understand the art, but also the artist: the gallery opens with\na self-portrait, accqompanied by one of his emblematic\nstill lifes \u2013 a representation of his legacy in art history.\nA clear timeline of his work emerges, with his early\npaintings appearing darker and centring more violent\nand daring motifs, and his main body of work being\nlighterandbrighterinbothpaletteandsubjectsdepict-ed. All the while, his later work returns to the darker\nand more vivid shades that characterized the beginning of his career, while retaining the themes that had\nemerged in the years following that \u2013 marking him as a\nfully established artist.\nFor my part, I found this exhibition to be a lovingly crafted homage to Cezanne. Likewise, his love for\nhis family and for his native Aix-en-Provence shines\nfrom his work, making it all the more wonderful to\nbehold when knowing the context behind it. Exhibits include portraits of his partner and life-long model\nMarie-Hortense Fiquet, and of their son Paul, whose\nchildhooddrawingsfeaturealongsidehisfather\u2019sinthe\nlatter\u2019s sketchbook, in what constitutes a most endearing display that helps humanize the artist. Meanwhile,\nhis landscapes of his holiday destination of l\u2019Estaque,\nor of the Mont Sainte-Victoire, a limestone mountain\nand landmark of Aix-en-Provence, exude a certain nos-talgia. Their parallel brushstrokes (characteristic of\nCezanne) and the contrast between the more vibrant\ngreen and blue pigments and the paler shades of earthy\ntones used, as well as the occasional white space visible amid the brushstrokes, give these paintings a flat,\nchalky quality that sets them apart from most other\nImpressionist paintings: where the latter sought to play\nwith light and atmosphere, thus depicting ephemeral\nmoments, Cezanne renders his landscapes timeless.\nThe one drawback the EY exhibition does have is its\npersistence in trying to elucidate some political meaning from Cezanne\u2019s work; while some subtle symbolism may be gleaned from works such as The Eternal\nFeminineandScipio,alotoftheinterpretationappears\nto hinge on speculation; it is quite clear that, whatever his political opinions may have been (and it is not\nunreasonable to assume that his friendships with Zola\nand Pissarro had some influence over that), he likely\ndid not want us to know them \u2013 and they may remain\nobscured by the aesthetics of his work.\nIt is also worth noting that this exhibition is supported by the Huo family foundation. Its founder, Yan\nHuo,isaco-founderandchiefinvestmentofficerofthe\nBritish hedge fund Capula Investment Management,\nand has donated \u00a3200 000 to the Conservative Party during the 2019 general election, according to the\nElectoral Commission; however, the foundation has\nalso donated \u00a31 million to Imperial College\u2019s REACT\nprogramme during the Covid-19 pandemic. Personally, I find it difficult to draw any specific conclusion\nfrom this, and I am not presenting this information in\nan attempt to moralize an art exhibition, but rather be-causeIconsidereditimportanttoincludeit.Imaintain\nthat the exhibition is worth seeing for its artistic value,\nand do not believe that it has been used to make any\nkind of statement on contemporary politics.\nOne of the more overlooked artists of his time, when\ncompared to giants like Monet or van Gogh, Cezanne\nis nonetheless an emblematic figure of French Impressionism, and the EY exhibition manages to not only\ndelve into his work, but also to somewhat decipher the\nman behind the painting, in a carefully curated and\nwonderfully educational tour-de-force. Alternating\npaintings with personal letters, sketchbooks, and reviews of his work written by fellow artists, be they his\ncontemporaries or ours, the exhibit left me with a sense\nof having learned much about him, yet with some lingering curiosity still.\nCezanne \u2013 the Portrait of a Quiet Man\nReviewed by Alexandra Cazacu Arts Writer\nPaul Cezanne\nWhere?

The\nreason I bring this up, is not to\ntrauma-dump, but because without that breakdown, I wouldn\u2019t\nhave read To The Lighthouse by\nVirginia Woolf, a book that deals\nexclusively with grief, love, and \u2013\nin its own way \u2013 healing, through\nthe lens of male mental health.\nLoosely autobiographical, the\nbook has been described by Woolf as an elegy to her\nparents: Woolf\u2019s mother died when she was age 13,\nsomething which her father never recovered from.\nOther similar family tragedies continued to plague\nher life \u2013 half-sister Stella Duckworth died of\nillness in 1897, followed shortly by her father\nin 1904. This tragedy contributed to Woolf\u2019s\nmental illness, and the death of her mother\nwould haunt Woolf throughout her life - and\nindeed this book - as Mrs. Ramsay\u2019s death\nplays a key role in the development of plotlines and characters.\nFrom a technical standpoint, the novel\nis dizzyingly beauti- ful.\nWoolf uses her signature stream-of-consciousness style to perfectly mim-icthejollityandhustleandbustleoftheRamsayfamily\nand their colourful guests, throwing the reader perfectly into the midst of the novel, albeit taking me several\nrereads of the opening passages to fully acquaint myself with the large cast of characters. Once you settle\nin however, you begin to\nappreciate the novel for\nwhat it is in its purest form:\na labour of love. Through\nthe stream-of-conscious-ness writing style and the\nomission of speech marks,\none can fully appreciate\nthe characters because their\nintentions, thoughts, and\nspeech become one. By getting a much greater insight\ninto the characters, the reader is able to get a better\nsense of their humanity - they feel like real tangible\npeople who you genuinely care for.\nThe prose is poetic, and as witty and perceptive as Woolf herself usually is. The second part in particular is especially so, as\nWoolf merges the slow degradation of the\nRamsay\u2019s now abandoned holiday home\nwith the disintegration of the family as\ntime rages on. Then the third\npart shows the descent of\nMr. Ramsay into the Woolfian motif of a tyrannical,\noverbearing male, but it\nis evident that this tyranny that the Ramsay children endure post-Mrs.\nRamsay\u2019s death is a way\nof exploring expressions of grief. Mr. Ramsay falls into that particularly\nmale trap of repressing grief and masking it with an-ger, harming his children in the process. He desperately\ncraves sympathy, without leaving space to allow himself\nto be vulnerable.\nAs someone who has been in Mr. Ramsay\u2019s position,\nit was uncomfortably insightful to see myself how others might have seen me at my worst. It\u2019s a testament to\nWoolf\u2019s genius and writing ability that she can penetrate the mind of a (typical) man and characterise him\nin such a nuanced way. This mastery is finally exhibited\nin the transformative effect that occurs whereby confronting the past, and the memories that lead to his\ntrauma, rather than boxing it away deep within the\nconfines of his mind, Mr. Ramsay isn\u2019t redeemed per\nse, but absolved of his past \u2013 he once again becomes a\nfigureforhischildrentoadmire.Withoutproselytising\ntoo much, it\u2019s a pertinent parable for today.\nAnd what I\u2019ve portrayed here is only a fragment of\nthe brilliance of To The Lighthouse; it\u2019s more than just a\nparticular story of male mental health \u2013 this is only one\naspect of the depth and richness of Woolf\u2019s novel. And\nthat is why it\u2019s my favourite novel of all time.\nEdited by: Zanna Buckland\nBooks\nBooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk 15\nTo The Lighthouse: My Favourite Novel\nof all Time\nBook Review\nMohammad Majlisi Books Writer\nFRIDAY 24TH NOVEMBER 2022\n\u201c\nFROM A TECHNICAL\nSTANDPOINT, THE\nNOVEL IS DIZZYINGLY\nBEAUTIFUL\nAbove: Virginia Wolff, author of To the Lighthouse.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\n14\nMUSIC\nMusic.felix@imperial. ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nMan-Made Sunshine Release Self-Titled Debut EP\nWritten by Amy Smith Music Writer\nThere are many kinds of music out there: songs\nthat make you want to dance the night away\nunder flashing lights, your guilty pleasures and your\nchildhood throwbacks and then there are the melodic\nexplorations that feel so honest that they leave a permanent mark. Man-Made Sunshine\u2019s debut EP falls\ninto that last group.\nThe pandemic with its lockdowns and quarantines\nleft many of us with the time to realise and reflect on\nour lives. In an Instagram post about his new solo pro-ject, Man-Made Sunshine aka Conor Mason, the lead\nsinger of the popular indie-rock band Nothing But\nThieves, describes this EP as a fruit of his own time\nreflection. Twirling in the realms of alt-indie, psych-pop and electronica, Man-Made Sunshine discusses\nand processes his \u201ctrapped emotions and unprocessed\nmemories\u201d through five songs. Though this EP stems\nfrom a heavy time in Mason\u2019s life, the EP doesn\u2019t feel\nweighed down. Instead, Man-Made Sunshine deals\nwith healing, survival and, ultimately, strength and\nleaves the listener feeling lifted.\nThe EP\u2019s lead single, \u2018Big\u2019, has a pop-sounding exterior yet an incredibly dark subject matter, allowing for\na beautiful parallel between the two that Mason has\nbalanced perfectly. On a first listen, this juxtaposition\nbetween the light and airy melodies and lyrics describing an incredibly tough time in the artist\u2019s life may be\nmissed. The next track, \u2018Little Bird\u2019, feels like an ode\nto his inner child. Conor leaves a piece of himself in\nevery line, melody, and element of this track. Building\nfrom a quiet conversation that eventually crescendos\ninto a release that feels freeing and cathartic and, with\nMason\u2019s magical yet raw vocals layered perfectly above\nan almost ethereal instrumental, the chorus\u2019 emotive\npower will give you goosebumps; \u2018Little Bird\u2019 has got\nto be one of his best vocal performances to date.\n\u2018Life\u2019s Gonna Kill\nYou (If You Let It)\u2019\naddresses friendship\nand learning self-love\nin a way that feels\nbeautifully fragile\nwith an intimate\navant-garde sound.\nDelicate piano builds\nthroughout the song\nas Mason\u2019s soul-infused falsetto layers gently over the\ntop, much like the kind voice of a friend. The track\nsomehow feels familiar yet unlike anything done be-fore. Uncovering themes of personal struggle and the\nstrength to overcome them, Mason evokes a strong\nsense of solidarity and unity in his lyrics through the\nhonesty he projects, creating a song that leans on a\nkind of hopeless feeling that, though dark, somehow\nas an aura of levity and balance.\nThe final track, \u2018Rosebud\u2019, acts as a sublime conclusion to the work. Sonically, Mason has created\na sound entirely apart from the mighty rock style\nfeatured on endless Nothing But Thieves belters.\nAlthough the track begins largely with mellow and\nmelodic piano, Mason utilises electronic manipulation of his vocals to build to a more intricate sound,\nmerging indie and electronica effortlessly.\nAll in all, this is a great opening to Mason\u2019s solo\ncareer. He has created a singular EP showcasing his\nindividuality and vast musical diversity. Whoever\nyou are, whatever you are dealing with, at least one of\nthese songs will resonate with you.\nMan-Made Sunshine: The Brilliant Solo Project from Nothing But Thieves Frontman Conor Mason\nTune in to IC Radio!\nWritten by IC Radio\nAlbum Reviews\nFelix Recommends\nTune into IC Radio anywhere anytime on\nicradio.com and check out the whole range of\nshows available.

The winners will be announced on 2nd December this year, in\nBoston.\nA team of researchers led by Imperial College London and the Institute\nof Cancer Research, London, have discovered variable voltages in the\nmembranes of breast cancer cells. It is known that when cells become\ncancerous, they undergo a series of bioelectric changes. For example,\nthe cell membrane becomes more positively charged than healthy cell\nmembranes. The researchers have discovered that in addition to this,\nmembrane voltage fluctuates over time. They think this could indicate an\nelectrical communications network between cells. \u201c\u201cWe don't yet know\nwhy the voltage of membranes fluctuates in cancer cells but our discovery\nand technology, enabled by the exciting collaboration of engineers\nand biologists, opens doors to further work that could help us better\nunderstand cancer signalling networks and growth\u201d said co-lead author,\nDr Amanda Foust, from Imperial\u2019s Department of Bioengineering.\nThe fossils of two new Ordovician specimens have been unearthed in a\nsheepfieldnearLlandrindodWells,Wales.Initiallydiscoveredbyapairof\nindependent researchers, the finding attracted the attention of scientists\nfrom Cambridge and Harvard, who joined the pair in studying the new\nfossils. Although their exact place in evolutionary history has not yet\nbeen found, the research team know the specimens to be ancestors of the\narthropods\u2014a phylum which includes modern-day insects, arachnids,\nand crustaceans.

The team found that the structures of neutron stars were what\nProf. Rezzola described as \u201ca bit like chocolate pralines\u201d: light neutron\nstars have a soft mantle and stiff core (like soft chocolate with a hazelnut\ninside), and heavy neutron stars have a stiff mantle and soft core (like\nhard chocolate surrounding a filling).\nPhysicists uncover sweet secrets behind neutron star\nstructures\nMoonbound: Artemis\nmoon rocket finally\nlaunches\nTaylor Pomfret Science Editor\nMission Facts\nLaunch date: Nov. 16, 2022\nMission duration: 25 days, 11 hours, 36 minutes\nTotal distance travelled: 1.3 miIlion miles\nRe-entry speed: 24,500 mph (Mach 32)\nSplashdown: Dec. 11, 2022\nNASA has launched its most powerful rocket to date at 01:47 local\ntime (06:47 GMT) on Wednesday 16 th\nNovember from Kennedy Space Centre,\nheaded for the Moon.\nThe mission marks nearly 50 years\nsince humans last visited the moon. In\nDecember 1972, American astronaut\nEugene Cernan left the last set of footprints on the Moon. This was ultimately\nthe last manned mission to the Moon\u2014\nApollo 17\u2014and broke many records:\nthe longest crewed lunar landing mission (12 days), greatest distance from a\nspacecraft during an extravehicular activity of any type (7.6 km or 4.7 miles)\nand largest lunar samples brought back\nto Earth (approximately 115kg).\nLooking to continue Apollo\u2019s lega-cy, the launch of the Orion spacecraft\nmarks the first mission of the Artemis\nprogramme, fittingly named after Apollo\u2019s twin sister in Greek mythology.\nThe spacecraft is uncrewed for this\nflight, with robots and mannequins\nonboard testing for future crewed mis-sions. Artemis I is scheduled to be 26\ndays, spending at least 6 of those days\nin a distant retrograde orbit around the\nmoon. Following trans-lunar injection,\nthe mission plans to deploy 10 \u201cCubeSat\u201d satellites: small, miniaturised low-cost satellites designed to use smaller,\ncheaper, and lower-power components\nthan traditional space missions.\nOrion will return and re-enter the\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere at a speed of 24,500\nmph and splashdown in the Pacific\nOcean on December 11, marking the\nend of the Artemis I mission. According\nto plan, the next Artemis mission will\nbe the crewed Artemis 2 launch taking\nplacein2024,withthecrewedArtemis3\nlunar landing and Artemis 4\u2019s docking of\nthe lunar gateway (a mini space station\nin orbit around the Moon) scheduled to\nlaunch in 2025 and 2027 respectively.\nThe build of the Lunar Gateway will include crucial contributions by staff from\nthe Department of Physics at Imperial\nCollege London. Researchers from the\nspace and atmospheric physics research\ngroup are building the magnetometer\nsensor that will monitor cosmic and solar rays as part of ESA\u2019s European radiation sensors array that will assist experiments on-board the Gateway to assess\nhow deep space conditions could affect\nastronauts and equipment.\nArtemis has also promised that women and people of colour will feature\nat the forefront of the programme\u2019s\nendeavours, with NASA promising\nto land the first woman and first person of colour on the Moon. Charlie\nBlackwell-Thompson, the agency\u2019s first\nfemale launch director, said in a speech\nto staff at NASA, following the launch:\n\u201cYou are part of a first\u2014it doesn\u2019t\ncome along very often!\u201d\n\u201cWe are all part of something incredibly special: the first launch of Artemis.\nThe first step in returning our country\nto the Moon and on to Mars.

    "content": "The horror genre has been very controversial in the\nlast couple of years. With time people got used\nto most of the twists and techniques. There are a lot of\ncringe, laughable and senseless\nreleases nowadays. A good horror anthology is even rarer. The classics like The Twilight Zone set the bar high. However, Guillermo\ndel Toro\u2019s Cabinet of Curiosities is not falling short.\nUsing his platform and resources he brought together\na variety of talented directors working in the genre,\ncurating them and giving them creative freedom on\neach episode of the show.\nIn total Cabinet of Curiosities sums up to about\n8 hours of watch time. As is the difference between\ndirectors, every episode is unique with its own story\nand style. Specifically, two of them: \u201cLot 36\u201d and \u201cThe\nMurmuring\u201d were co-written by del Toro himself.\nOtherepisodesarebasedonstoriesbymultipleauthors,\nincluding H.P. Lovecraft. Each of these tales opens\nwith Guillermo del Toro coming out of the shadows\nand introducing us to the next self-contained story\nwith the relevant item and miniature of the director\nretrieved from the Cabinet of Curiosities.\nLet\u2019s dive in and have a look at each of\nthem separately.\nFirst on the list, \u201cLot 36\u201d, is a story\nabout a veteran chased by collectors.\nHe\u2019sdesperatelytryingtomakemoney\nby reselling valuables from purchased\nabandoned storage units. Nick, our\nxenophobic, right-wing protagonist,\nmanages to get a unit of a mysterious\ndeceased old man. What is it that\nhe will find in the unit and where\nit will lead him? Corpses,\ntentacles and monsters, if\nthat\u2019s what you\u2019re into,\nthis episode is for you.\nWethenmovetothestoryofMasson,agraverobber.\nSame money issues, a slightly different approach.\nBuried corpses and their valuables are what attracts his\nattention. As the title of this episode, \u201cGraveyard Rats\u201d,\nsuggests, it is about rats and Mason resembles one of\nthem. A claustrophobic rivalry between him and rats\nfor human remains is what this episode is all about.\nThe third and top-rated episode \u201cThe Autopsy\u201d\npresents us the story of Dr Carl Winters, who\u2019s been\nasked to perform autopsies on several dead miners.\nAll of the bodies are mysteriously drained of blood.\nSomething extraterrestrial is involved in their death, so\nwhat will his search reveal? This episode is the nastiest\nand contains a lot of gore scenes, exactly what this\nseries needs.\nFollowing the post-mortem comes a tale\nabout Stacey and her insecurities. She doesn\u2019t\nmeet the beauty standards, is somewhat\nawkward and quirky, doesn\u2019t fit in. After\na Christmas party Stacey discovers\nan expensive lotion Alo Glo that all\nthe \u201cbeautiful\u201d women at her\nworkplace use. Though this\nlotion is not just a beauty\nproduct, it\u2019s supposed to\nc h a n g e \u201cThe Outside\u201d.\nEverything comes with a price,\nand this is no exception.\n\u201d P i c k m a n\u2019 s Model\u201d is\nnext on the list and is based\non the short story by H . P .\nLovecraft. Art\u2019s central\nfeature is to arouse emotions.\nThis tale brings it to extremes;\nhorrificworksofartdepictingdemons,\nwitches and a variety of gruesome scenes\nmake people go insane. Is it real\nor just in their head?\nOn the topic of witches, \u201cDreams\nin the Witch House\u201d is the least\nloved among the audience.\nTwins separated in childhood\nby death try to get back\ntogether. Walter Gilman spends\nhis life trying to find a way to find\nthe dimension his sister Epperley\nwas dragged into. The sassy witch, the\nhuman-faced rat we meet later\nand weak acting is what repels\nthe viewer from this story.\nAs was mentioned\nsomeoftheepisodesarenotfor e ver yone.\nThe next one, \u201cThe Viewing\u201d, is exactly\none of them. This episode doesn\u2019t try\nto go into action straight away, instead ,\nwe get a long and mysterious d i a l o g u e\nbetween even more mysterious characters.\nThe visuals are what brings this episode\nto another level and makes it stand out.\nThe last episode in the series\nis a beautiful\nending to this 8\nhour roller-coaster. \u201cThe\nMurmuring\u201d is a gore and\nshock-free tale about a married\ncouple of ornithologists who recently lost their\ndaughter Ava. To get away from grief and complete\ntheir research they go to a remote location with an\nold house. That\u2019s where Nancy, the wife, begins to see\nghosts. Is it just grief or something that the house is\ntrying to hide? This episode is driven by emotions and\nhas the strongest leads\u2019 performances in the series.\nThere might be episodes that you\u2019ll find boring or\nweak, but that cabinet has in store something for any\naudience.Mypersonalfavouritesandrecommendations\nwould be \u201cThe Autopsy\u201d, \u201cThe Outside\u201d and \u201cThe\nMurmuring\u201d. Guillermo del Toro\u2019s Cabinet of Curiosities\nis a must-watch if you still didn\u2019t find time for it.\nCabinet of Curiosities\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEdited by: Jonah Hewett\nMike Buzadji\nFilm\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\n10\nFilm Review\nReview of Guillermo del Toro\u2019s latest anthology series release on Netflix\nMike Buzadji Film Writer\nOctober 2022\nDirector:\nStarring:\nGuillermo del Toro\nUnited States, Mexico\nLize Johnston, Kevin Keppy, etc.\nCountry:\nRelease:\nFELIX WANTS\nYOU\nFor more details contact: film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n4\nCancer metastasis activation\nworsens during sleep\nWang Guo Staff Writer\nCancer is one of the deadliest diseases\nin the world, killing a total of 10 million\npeople in 2020 alone. The main cause\nof cancer is the accumulation of genetic\nmutations over time, which leads to\nuncontrolled cell division. However,\nthis is only the starting point as other\nfactors, including circadian rhythms,\nare essential for the further expansion of\ncancer. Circadian rhythms are periodic\nchanges in the body's physiology over\ntime. The best-known example of a\ncircadian rhythm is the sleep-wake cycle,\nwhich has recently been found to play\na fundamental role in the successful\nspread of cancer cells throughout the\nbody, also known as metastasis.\nMetastasis is responsible for 90% of\ncancer deaths, so if we could find a way\nto stop cancer cells metastasising, we\nwould greatly reduce cancer mortality.\nIn metastasis, cancer cells are separated\nfrom the tumour of origin and end up\nin the blood. Cancer cells found in the\nblood are called circulating tumour\ncells (CTCs). CTCs travel through the\nblood vessels and form new tumours in\nother parts of the body. It is unclear how\nCTCs are generated from the tumour\nof origin. Traditionally, the assumption\nwas that mechanical stimuli cause CTC\nformation. However, research published\nin Nature earlier this June has suggested\nthat CTCs are mainly produced during\ndeep sleep. To prove that, scientists took\nblood samples from 30 women with\nbreast cancer at 10 am and 4 am on the\nsame day. Analytics revealed that 78.3%\nof the total CTCs detected came from\nthe blood samples taken at 4 am when\nthe patients were sleeping.\nTo further support the findings, the\nresearchers injected breast cancer cells\ninto established mouse models and\nallowed the tumours to grow inside\nthe mice. Being nocturnal animals,\nmice have inverted circadian rhythms\ncompared to humans. It turned out\nthat CTCs were also detected in blood\nwhen the mice slept during the day. This\nproves that the activation of metastasis\nis not time-based but circadian rhythm-based.\nCircadian rhythms are heavily\ninfluenced by the punctual production\nand secretion of endocrine hormones\nsuch as melatonin (the hormone of\nsleep). Therefore, scientists decided\nto alter the melatonin levels of mouse\nmodels to observe how this influenced\nthe concentration of CTCs. Levels of\nmelatonin secretion are greatly affected\nby light, so scientists disturbed mouse\nmodels\u2019 circadian rhythms by reversing\ntheir light exposure, removing light\nduring waking periods and supplying\nlight during sleeping periods. Overall,\nscientists found a 30- to 290-fold\ndecrease in the concentrations of CTCs\nin the sleep-disturbed mice compared\nto the control mice, indicating slowed-down metastasis. However, if the\nmice were treated with melatonin\nbefore perturbing their sleep cycle, the\nconcentration of CTCs increased. All\nthese findings suggest that melatonin\nplays a key role in the generation of\nCTCs that leads to metastasis and\nultimately death.\nThis is a recent study, so further\nresearch still needs to be done before\ntranslating this finding into therapeutic\ntreatments. However, there are two\nthings we can do right now based on\nthe research. Firstly, more studies on\nthe impact of circadian rhythms on\ncancer progression should be carried\nout as most current investigations\nrevolve around genetic mutations.\nSecondly, it is essential to continuously\nmonitor CTC levels in cancer patients,\nespecially during sleep, as this can help\nto better understand patients\u2019 cancer\nprogression and prepare health staff\nfor potential future aggravations of the\ndisease. There are already electronic\ndevices that can monitor the levels of\nCTCs in real time and report the data\non the mobile phone. However, they\nare not commercially available yet as the\ntechnology is still undergoing further\ntesting and enhancement.\nCancer is deadly due to metastasis, so\ntackling metastasis could be considered\nalmost like curing cancer. If we could\nmanipulate the circadian rhythms\nof patients without causing sleep\ndeprivation, many lives would be saved.\nCredit: Envato Elements\nEdited by: Jamie John\nAngie Lo\nTaylor Pomfret\nScience\nResearch suggests melatonin plays a key role in increasing CTC production during sleep\nMORE STUDIES\nON THE IMPACT\nOF CIRCADIAN\nRHYTHMS\nON CANCER\nPROGRESSION\nSHOULD BE\nCARRIED OUT\n\u201c\n\n"

    "content": "FTX, which allowed customers to trade\ncryptocurrencies for assets such as\nother tokens or conventional money, was previously\nconsidered a core pillar of the industry, and its CEO Mr\nBankman-Fried the \u2018King of Crypto\u2019 for both his huge\ninfluence and investment in the sector. The company\u2019s\nfall from grace was rapid: in January it raised $400m\nfrom investors including Softbank at a valuation of\n$32bn, now customers are wondering if they will ever\nretrieve the money they held with the platform.\nThe exchange\u2019s collapse started with a leaked balance\nsheet reported by crypto news website CoinDesk\nthat reportedly showed another of Bankman-Fried\u2019s\ncompanies, a crypto trading firm named Alameda\nResearch, was using FTX\u2019s own token as collateral. Just\na few days later further accusations were made by the\nWall Street Journal that FTX was lending customers\u2019\ndeposits to Alameda Research to fund \u2018risky bets\u2019 on\nthe stock market. Following these rumours, Binance\n\u2013 the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange and FTX\u2019s main\ncompetitor \u2013 decided to publicly sell their entire\nstock of FTX-related tokens. The resulting run on\nthe platform revealed a severe lack of liquid assets to\ncover customers\u2019 withdrawals, as it came to light that\nAlameda did indeed owe FTX as much as $10bn but\nwas unable to pay up. For comparison, the Financial\nTimes reported that FTX needed approximately $8bn\nto cover the liabilities.\nBriefly, it appeared that FTX might be saved by its\nmost fierce competitor, as Binance tentatively agreed\na non-binding deal last Wednesday to acquire the\nstruggling company. Just two days later they walked\naway, however, sighting legal issues and \u201cmishandled\ncustomer funds\u201d.\nFTX is yet another high-profile name to capitulate\nin the latest bite of the crypto winter. Bankman-Fried\u2019s\nother nickname, the \u2018White Knight of Crypto\u2019, came as\nhe bailed out and bought two cryptocurrency lenders in\nJuly earlier this year. Last week, it was his turn to search\nfor salvation. Firms such as crypto hedge fund Three\nArrows Capital and lender Celsius Network have also\nbeen high profile failures in 2022.\nSo, what does this really mean for the industry? First\nand foremost, it\u2019s yet another blow to confidence in\nthe concept of cryptocurrency. Considering that such\ncurrencies rely entirely on the consumer\u2019s belief that\nthey are worth something due to no intrinsic value,\nthis confidence is precious and paramount to their\nsuccess. Bitcoin prices ticked down in response to the\nnews, trading around $17,000 from $63,800 a year\nago. Solana, a blockchain technology heavily publicly\nsupported by Bankman-Fried, has now seen a reduction\nin Total Value Locked (TVL, which can be thought of\nas value of all currencies \u2018held\u2019 on the blockchain) of\n$700msincetheoriginalNov.2ndreportbyCoinDesk.\nCompared to its $1bn TVL before the announcement,\nthe drop far outweighs the negative performance of the\ndigital currency market over the same period (-21.7%).\nOther major exchanges are scrambling to assure\ncustomers that they will not be the next FTX, with\nBinance, Deribit, OKX, and crypto.com promising\nproof that their reserves are sufficient to match\ncustomer liabilities. Tether, a stablecoin pegged to the\nUS dollar, has recently faced over $3bn in customer\nconversions as traders pulled out of the digital currency\nmarketenmasse.Inpolicymaking,Americanpoliticians\npreviously considering pushing laws encouraging\ndecentralised finance will be revaluating their options\nas lobbying associated with FTX inevitably dies down\nand the industry takes yet another big hit.\nAmongst the chaotic events of the past week, perhaps\nless extensively covered is another of crypto\u2019s current\nshortcomings: on Friday evening, after the bankruptcy\nannouncement, FTX was also hacked, the culprits\ngetting away with assets valued at around $500m.\nThis is the latest in a myriad of cybercrime incidents\nthat are plaguing the industry. Last month a Binanceaffliated blockchain bridge (which allows users to move\ncurrencies between different types of chain, e.g. Ether\nto Bitcoin) was hacked for $570m worth of assets.\nAlthough the exchange managed to calm investors by\nfreezing most of these, the hackers still managed to\nwithdraw $100m from the system, and the suspension\nraised another question: if a select group of people can\nfreeze parts of the blockchain to stop withdrawals, is\ncrypto actually so decentralised after all?\nBinance announced on Tuesday that it would start\nan industry recovery fund to help companies struggling\nwith liquidity issues in the wake of FTX, but it stands\nto be seen just how far-reaching the implications of such\na dramatic capitulation will be. For Bankman-Fried and\nhis companies, it will stand to be seen if further action\nis taken with several potential legal cases on the cards.\nIt is not clear whether all the failures in the crypto\nspace have been idiosyncratic as FTX\u2019s largely was,\nor if they are indeed following a downward trend of\nconfidence in the system. In either case, the entire space\nhas been shaken up and its future is being questioned.\nMy advice: tread carefully.\nOn Friday 11th November, it was announced that\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried would resign\nfrom CEO of the world\u2019s 3rd largest cryptocurrency\nexchange as it filed for bankruptcy.\nAlexander Themistocleous\nInvestment Society Writer\nFTX\u2019s Collapse Heaps More Challenges on Crypto\nInvestment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Harry Schlote\nInvestment\nic.investmentsociety ic.investmentsociety\nic\u2013investment\nADD OUR SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES FOR THE LATEST EVENTS, NEW & OPPORTUNITIES\nSam Bankman-Fried.

Do you guys think live\nmusic brings the streams, or is it the opposite way?\nW: I think we play the most in those places, right?\nK: Also, people who like our genre of music live the\nmost in those cities. But it would be cool if Brazil was\non top. Maybe you can help us, I would love to see S\u00e3o\nPaulo up there, I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re from. (For\nreference, I, the interviewer, am Brazilian.)\nF: That would be crazy. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think\npost-punk is big there,\nbut it would be crazy\nif it became. I feel like\nBrazil has so much to\noffer, but we\u2019re so isolated\nand all trends get there\nlate. I mean, this sound\nis becoming a big thing\nright now because of\nthe Windmill, with the\nexplosion of black midi,\nBlack Country, New\nRoad, Squid\u2026 they are all\nfrom \u201chere\u201d.\nW: I think it\u2019s similar in\nthe Netherlands, most\npeople who like music we like have heard of this place.\nK: I put it in my Instagram story that tonight we\u2019re\nplaying in The Windmill, and it got a lot of likes from\nour friends\u2026 But do you think it\u2019s coming to Brazil?\nBecause you always see \u201cCome to Brazil\u201d and a huge\ngroup comes. If you go there as a band, do you think\nthere will be a crowd?\nF: Oh, if you say, \u201ca Dutch band is coming\u201d, people are\ngoing to go, because it\u2019s ~~so~~ eccentric for us; it\u2019s so\nnew and rare.\nK: Well, if we go, we are not taking the boat. We\u2019ll\ndefinitely take the train.\nF: Let\u2019s go back to the energy subject we talked\nabout! I have friends that have been to the same\ngigs I have seen you at; I saw you with Pom Poko at\nthe Village Underground, and I also saw you at The\nShacklewell Arms. My friends loved it because of the\nenergy you guys emanate, but when they listened to\nthe recorded material, they said it wasn\u2019t as energetic\nas before. Do you think it\u2019s a struggle to translate the\nenergy live to the recorded material?\nW: It\u2019s something I talk about with Casper van der\nLans. I record all stuff with him and we mix it together.\nWe talk about that quite a lot. We like building\nproductions from small things and stack stuff on top of\neach other, because we like records that sound like that.\nI also like records that sound really loud, but for the\nrecord we recorded, I was quite happy with the result.\nIt wasn\u2019t the band playing live, but maybe in the future\nit will be.\nF: I\u2019ve listened to the singles; I haven\u2019t listened to the\nnew album quite yet because it didn\u2019t get sent to me\n(I looked at their manager, sitting next to us). But I\nlistened to all the singles, and I compared them to\nGazebo, your last EP, which I\u2019ve listened to multiple\ntimes, and wow, I feel like you guys are finally starting\nto hit the nail on the head with the new production\nstyle. It\u2019s way more encapsulating, I feel like I\u2019m more\nin the mosh than before.\nW: That\u2019s awesome! Thanks!\nK: Last week Willem and Casper actually recorded a\nlot of stuff for album number 2.\nF: Already?\nK: You\u2019ll maybe like it; I was also very impressed by the\nstep-up in production. It sounds really cool.\nF: It\u2019s my favourite part of the band. The positivity\nand the strong energy.\nAbout the new\nalbum, is it going to\nbe similar to Gazebo,\nwhich has a lot of\nday-to-day, down-to-earth metaphors that\naddress both personal\nand political issues?\nIs Big Love Blanket,\ncarrying on the torch\nor is it a different vibe?\nW: The words are\nmostly taking the piss,\nand we\u2019ll carry on\ndoing that for now. I\nwant to change things up because I\u2019m quite tired of the\neasy referencing of pop culture. It will probably change\nin the future, but I liked it for a while!\nK: Me and Willem had a lot of conversations about\nthis because it took me a long time to figure out that it\u2019s\nsort of possible to take the piss in lyrics and not take it\ntoo seriously, that things can mean anything. It\u2019s finally\nclicked with me, but it took a long time. Especially if\nyou think about music, listen to music, or if you read\nbooks or watch films, you always want to know the\nmeaning or what it\u2019s about, and the way Willem is like\nis, \u201csometimes I know what I want to say, but it\u2019s up\nin the air, or I think it sounds cool\u201d. And I think it\u2019s\ncool that he still makes music that feels relatable but\nwithout the intention of it being relatable to a certain\nthing.\nF: It\u2019s already hard to find your lyrics online! So it\u2019s\nhard to analyse what Willem is talking about.\nK: I would love an elaborate Genius page on Personal\nTrainer, with all the lyrics and references. I used it for\nthe new BC,NR album.\nW: I quite like Genius, it\u2019s cool. You have a lot of fun\nwith things people think stuff is about and I get very\nemotional over it because I say, \u201cthat\u2019s not what it\u2019s\nabout!\u201d. It\u2019s cool though, I like it.\nK: Do we have a song on Genius?\nF: I don\u2019t think so. I was looking today, but there are\ntwo Personal Trainers on there.\nW: There\u2019s actually three in total! There is a band with\n3 girls in it and they play garage rock music, and there\u2019s\nalso this pop star called Personal Trainer, very eccentric\nwith cool clothes. I was actually in contact with them\nand I suggested that we should do a show with the three\nof us once we go to the States.\nK: Were they down with it?\nW: They were probably like \u201cHaha sure\u201d\u2026\nF: Talking about Genius, if you could choose one\nsong to perform in Genius Verified, what would you\nchoose?\nW: Maybe it\u2019s nice to tell people about the Vaalserberg,\nmaybe people should know about the mountain.\nF: Which song?\nW: It\u2019s called \u2018Vaalserberg Hero\u2019, it\u2019s on the record that\nis out tonight. It\u2019s not really about the mountain.\nVaalserberg is the highest one in the Netherlands.\nK: 323 metres high.\nW: It\u2019s not very high. It would be nice for people to get\nthat.\nK: And there\u2019s kind of a metaphor in there.\nW: I guess, yeah. Definitely.\nF: How do you feel about finally playing at The\nWindmill now?\nW: It\u2019s cool, they have a Jack Medley wall, which is\ncool. I once stayed at this guy\u2019s place in Brighton. It\u2019s\nreally nice to have him here. He passed away a year and\na half ago.\nK: Playing here also feels a bit silly, people might think\nwe might be cosplaying BC,NR because we have this\none song with trumpets\u2026 Don\u2019t get me wrong, we love\nBC,NR, we played \u2018The Place Where He Inserted the\nBlade\u2019 today in the car and we all sang along.\nW: Except for Leon.\nK: He\u2019ll get there. He\u2019s new.\nF: He\u2019s new?\nBoth, in unison: Our new guitar player.\nF: Final words! Why should people listen to Big\nLove Blanket?\nK: I think it suits well to a lot of occasions.\nW: It\u2019s good for studying.\nK: It gives you much-needed energy. It\u2019s way better\nthan drinking coffee at 10pm because you have an\nexam tomorrow. If you drink a coffee, you can\u2019t\nsleep and you get tired. It\u2019s nice to play a show\nwithout sleep as Willem said, but doing an exam\nwithout sleep is terrible! If it\u2019s 10pm and you still need\nto study\u2026 (What do you study?)\n(F: I study materials\u2026 science\u2026)\nK: \u2026 if you still need to study your materials science,\nit\u2019s great to put on 40 minutes of energetic but also\nsoothing indie rock music!\nPersonal Trainer went to put on an amazing\nperformance later that night, supported by the local\nband Home Counties, and by their compatriots from\nPipBlom.MakesuretogivealistentoBigLoveBlanket,\nPersonal Trainer (photo: Giovanni Fran\u00e7a)\nPersonal Trainer (photo: Giovanni Fran\u00e7a)\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\n12\nMUSIC\nMusic.felix@imperial. ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nPersonal Trainer!\nWritten by Giovanni Fran\u00e7a Music Writer\nLast Thursday, Amsterdam-based indie collective\nPersonal Trainer played at The Windmill, in Brixton,\nto celebrate the release of their new album, *Big Love\nBlanket*. Willem Smit, vocalist and mastermind\nbehind the project, and Kilian Kayser, percussionist,\nsat down to have a chat with the Felix before the start\nof the gig.\nThe band\u2019s recent UK tours have been\nflanked by a string of bad luck. Last year,\nthey were stranded in the UK after they all\ncaught Covid whilst on tour over here. On\nthewayoverthistime,thedooroftheirvan\nfell off in Calais. There followed a chaotic\nattempt to get hold of a mechanic whilst\nstranded in-between countries, which they\ncan only describe as similar to the Tom\nHanks film The Terminal. By the time the\nvan was fixed, they had missed two boats.\nFollowing a further boat cancelation,\nanother delay, and a lengthy spell at sea\ndue to stormy weather (punctuated by My\nHeart Will Go On and then two hours of\nMorrisey solo songs playing out through\nthe ferry), the band arrived in the UK.\nDespite their hellish travel experiences,\nPersonal Trainer frequent the UK often.\nI ask them what they think draws British\npeople to their live shows again and again. Kilian cites\na gig-going culture that exists around the UK\u2019s main\ncities: \u201cThe UK is quite big, and thickly populated, so\nyou can easily do a two-week tour and go to different\ncities, and in every city, there will be like, 50 people,\nyoung people mixed with old dads, that love going\nto gigs,\u201d he tells us, \u201cand that\u2019s not the vibe in the\nNetherlands, because it\u2019s too small. That\u2019s what\u2019s nice\nabout the UK, everywhere you go you will find a nice\ngroup of people that will go to every gig there is.\u201d\nHe also admits \u2018we do come here because we want to\nsee the UK\u2019. However, he\u2019s not too quick to praise the\ncountry, following up with \u201cit\u2019s also fun for us to make\nthem come back by giving them a nice show. \u201cMaybe\nnext time I\u2019ll plan to go to this gig, instead of it being\na regular Tuesday night of drinking and talking about\nfootball in a pub.\u201d\u201d\nHowever, it\u2019s not only for their live performances\nthat the band have received success in the UK: on\nSpotify, the cities that listen to Public Transport the\nmost are Amsterdam, Rotterdam and London. Willem\nbelieves that there is a symbiotic relationship between\nbuilding up a listener base and a live fanbase within\na city. Kilian attributes this to the cryptic statement\n\u201cpeople who like our genre of music live the most in\nthose cities.\u201d\nTonight, Public Transport are playing at The\nWindmill Brixton: a venue well-known for\nchampioning new music. The venue is not only a\nmilestone for the band, but also resonates with Wilem\npersonally. There is a wall in tribute of local legend\nJack Medley, who passed away in 2019, and who once\nhosted Wilem in Brighton. The venue\u2019s tribute seems\nto make Wilem only relish the opportunity to play\nthere even more, and he tells us \u201cIt\u2019s\nreally nice to have him here.\u201d\nMy favourite part of the band\u2019s music\nis the positivity it emanates. Even on\nlittle sleep, they are able to muster the\nstrength to put on an a high-energy\nperformance, with Wilem claiming\n\u201cI always like being very tired because\nyou have to push it all out. There is no\nclutter.\u201d Tonight is no different, and\nthey deliver a blazing set, supported by\nlocal band Home Counties, as well as\nby their compatriots Pip Blom.\nHowever, this energy is not always\ntranslated through the studio-recorded\ntracks. Willem recognises this too, and\nensurting that the band\u2019s enrapturing\nlive energy is captured in their studio\ntracks has been a big focus for their upcoming album:\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I talk about with Casper van der Lans,\u201d\nhe agrees, \u201cI record all stuff with him and we mix it\ntogether. We like building productions from small\nthings and stacking stuff on top of each other, because\nwe like records that sound like that. I also like records\nthat sound really loud, but for the record we recorded,\nI was quite happy with the result. It wasn\u2019t\nthe band playing live, but maybe in the\nfuture it will be.\u201d\nHavinglistenedtotheirnewsingles,and\ncompared them to their last EP, Gazebo, I\nbelieve that the ir production efforts have\npaid off. The new style hits the nail on\nthe head when it comes to rectifying the\nfeeling I get when I\u2019m in the mosh, and\nthe tracks are now far more encapsulating.\nKilian agrees: \u201cI was also very impressed\nby the step-up in production. It sounds\nreally cool!\u201d\nAnticipating the new album, I ask if\nit will feature the same large quantity\nof down-to-earth metaphors addressing\nboth personal and political issues which\nGazebo did. It\u2019s a subject for discussion\nbetween Willem and Kilian. Whilst they\nconfirm that this is the case, they hint at\nnew directions in the imminent future, Willem telling\nme \u201cI want to change things up because I\u2019m quite tired\nof the easy referencing of pop culture. It will probably\nchange in the future, but I liked it for a while!\u201d\nFelix works out with Amsterdam band Personal Trainer to talk new album and touring in the UK.\nWillem (left) and Killian (right) (photo: Giovanni Fran\u00e7a)\nPersonal Trainer (photo: Giovanni Fran\u00e7a)\nFelix Interviews...\n\n"
