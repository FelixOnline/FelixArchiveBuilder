    "content": "Clubs & Societies Felix 918 2\n2 November1991 The Sailing Jet Sea Cup\nOne of the most prestigious French\nuniversities, Sup de Co-Rouen, had\na brilliant idea of filling Easter\nvacations with an international\nregatta in the Caribbean seas: the\nJet Sea Cup. The first regatta (13th to 20th April'91) was a race\nbetween Point a Pitre and Antigua.\nThis years regatta (28th March to\n5th April'92) will run around the\nisland of Dominica.\nDominica is the largest of the\nLesser Antilles Islands and lies\nbetween the two French islands of\nMartinique and Guadalupe. Ruggedly beautiful and volcanic in\norigin, Dominica offers an\nincomparable opportunity to\nexperience one of the last spots on\nEarth, where nature's unchanged\nand unspoiled, both on land and in\nthe sea.\nSailing teams, made up of seven\n'entrepreneurial' persons (students,\ncompany representatives or both),\ncommand the same type of boat:\nCenturions 47. This makes the\n'playing field' level and gives\ngreater competitiveness to the\nracing. Day and night events\ncomprise in a series of off-shore\nraces and Olympic triangles lasting\nseven days, during which team\nspirit, enthusiasm, quick decision\nmaking and technical skills will\nselect a winning team.\nThe aim of this event is to enable\nstudents from European institutions\nto promote their Universities and\ntheir sponsors. It's also a chance to\nmeet executives from international\ncompanies and discuss the\nopportunities of summer internships\nand possible future careers.\nThe Jet Sea Cup is widely\ncovered by the media: a group of\njournalists will follow the race day\nby day on a Centurion 59. Media represented so far include ' Le Figaro',' VS D','FR3',' Les Echos', 'Cosmopolitan', 'France\nAntilles',' Yacht Club International' and ' Neptune Yachting'. It's therefore a great\nopportunity for companies seeking\ninternational recognition and\nwishing to promote themselves to\ntheir potential employees, clients\nand investors. Moet et Chandon\npublic relations attac he used to say\non International Student Regattas:\n\" These are the future directors of\ncompanies. These are the people\nwho will buy our champagne.\"\nIC Yacht Club( ICY C) is\nplanning to send at least one boat\nRobin Hood\nMen's Basketball team winning 68-27 against Kingston II.\nDribblers Win Again\nThe Dribblers, already headed for\nthe double in the League and Cup, made a storming start in the U AU last Saturday with an excellent 9-3\nvictory over Brunei. Brunei, with\na very strong side, just didn't know\nwhat hit them (although IC did and\nit was generally boots in the shins,\nelbows in the face, digs in the ribs,\nkicks to the ankles etc etc).\nAlthough the game was closely\nfought from start to finish it was IC\nwho had the finishing power. Jo,\nwho has been in stunning form all\nseason, scored a great goal in the\nfirst half, with the remaining goals\ncoming from Permi (7) and Lisa,\nwho got her much deserved first\ngoal for the team.\nThis was the best overall performance by the Dribblers to\ndate and arguably the toughest game\nthey have played in all season.\nHowever, true to form, the\nDribblers didn't let the game\ninterfere with the main contest of\nthe day, the customary boat race,\nwhich the Dribblers won in style.\n(But it could all have been so\ndifferent had Ethel not been too\ntired to take part in the race...)\nEight hundred years ago, in a particularly dark forest in deepest\nmedieval England, there lived a super hero, a man so remarkable\nthat his name and his story became\nthe stuff of legend for centuries to\ncome. His name was Robin of\nLocksley and his story went on to\nbe retold in numerous motion\npictures. The latest, Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, will be shown by\nFilmS oc this coming Thursday.\nThe film is a' loose' interpretation of the outlaw legend,\nwith a star studded cast led by\nKevin Costnor. Robin returns from\nthe crusades to find the evil Sheriff\nof Nottingham ruling all that he\nonce owned. Not to be outdone he\nflees to the forest to gather a band\nof rogues to steal from the rich and\ngive to the poor and generally upset\nthe Sheriff. So good at his job is our\nRobin, that the Sheriff kidnaps his\nonly true love, Maid Marian, and\nwhisks her away to his castle. All is the set for the ultimate\nconfrontation between good and\nevil.\nThe film has done so well in\nBritain that it has managed to gross\nmore than \u00a317 million, surpassing\nTerminator 2: Judgement Day at the\nbox office. It looks set to continue\nwell into the Christmas season with\nit still being shown across the West\nEnd. The film will be shown in Me chEng220 on Thursday the 28th of\nNovember at 7.30pm. Admission\nwill be 80p for members and \u00a31.80\nfor non-members. Membership is\n\u00a36 which includes the chance to see\none film free.\nto the West Indies in '92. ICY C syndicate wants to represent\nImperial College and promote it as\na top European Institution of\nScience, Engineering and Business\nto potential future students. The' inter nationality' of this syndicate\n(three French, two Britons, one\nAustralian and one Italian) perfectly\nmatches with this purpose.\nIn addition to its traditional\nsponsors ICY C is seeking others to\n'enlarge' its present budget. So if\nthere is any company seeking\ngreater international exposure and\nare interested in the Jet Sea Cup, please contact Evelyn Joslyn (Tel\n071-589-5111 ext 4689) for more\ninformation on this event.\nAndrea Micheletti.\nMalaysia Soc\nOn Saturday, 9 Nov1991, the\nMalaysia Soc did IC proud by\nbeating Loughborough University\nMalaysia Soc 3-2 in a friendly of\nvarious sporting activities. The\nevent took place at the\nLoughborough University campus\nand the games contested were\nvolleyball, badminton, squash, table\ntennis and football.\nThe reception at Loughborough \u2014hey, what reception?\nWell, anyway, to kick off the day,\nvolleyball was first on the agenda.\nA highly terse d and exciting game\nsaw the IC team coming back after\nlosing the first to win 2-1. Our celebration was short lived as\nLoughborough played well in\nBadminton to level the score.\nMidday, prayers for Muslim members were followed by lunch.\nLunch was typical Malaysian cuisine of rice and curry. Pleasant\nconversation and serious chatting-up followed. Meanwhile those not\nplaying games explored Loughborough town at their leisure.\nAt about 3pm, squash and table\ntennis were played simultaneously.\nThe IC team secured both events,\nwinning narrowly in squash and\ntrouncing Loughborough 6-0 in\ntable tennis. The last event of the\nday was football where Loughborough managed to run\ncircles around the IC team. An exciting match that ended with a42 score in favour of Loughborough.\nAfter exchanging souvenirs and\nfarewells, we settled down for the\nlong journey home. A memorable\nevent with a touch of sweet victory.\nSang Ratnam, Ci vEng1. "

It will\nbe some time before the final figure\nraised during the week is calculated,\nbut Mr Ellis estimates that it will be\nfrom \u00a35,000 to \u00a310,000.\nIn Tuesday's Slave Auction City\nand Guilds President Tim Proctor\nauctioned, amongst many others,\nthe Union Receptionists Michelle\nand Cathy, who were dressed as\nTweedles Dum and Dee.\nThe RCS Beer Festival on Wednesday attracted an estimated\n1200 people, said its organiser,\nFrank Evers. He added that it raised\n\u00a33,000 over costs, selling 5,500\npints of55 different beers from 6\ndifferent suppliers. He said that\nbitter ran out at about 9.45pm, though at its conclusion at 11.00pm some cider was still left. There was\nvirtually no mess and little trouble,\nexcept for an altercation between\nthe FOPP ESo c( Fuck Off Poofy\nPlant Eaters Society) and some\nstudents from The Royal School of\nMines over a four foot vibrator,\nwhich resulted in the destruction of\na reinforced glass door panel.\nTonight, the Smoking Concert\nCabaret will take place in the Union\nBuilding at 8.00pm. Tickets will\ncost \u00a33.00 on the door.\nDrugs\nA member of staff from Bernard\nSunley House faces disciplinary\naction after being suspected of\ndrugs peddling. Two students who\nwere also involved have been\nsuspended from the hall pending the\nresults of their tribunal.\nLinda Donegan, Warden of the\nHouse, made the following statement. ' Two undergraduates\nhave been suspended from Bernard\nSunley House pending the outcome\nof both the residence and college\ndisciplinary tribunals, following an\nincident involving drugs. The janitor at Evelyn Gardens has also\nbeen suspended and the normal\ncollege procedures are taking\nplace.'\nShe added that as a warden it was\nher duty 'to safeguard the welfare\nof the students in my trust and also\nthe reputation of the college.' She\nsaid that drugs of any nature can be\nextremely dangerous - particular y when taken with alcohol, and that\nit was very fortunate that someone\nwas on hand to control the situation\nbefore it went any further.\n'I don't think most students are\naware of the seriousness of taking\nor selling drugs of any kind. Is it\nreally worth sacrificing your University career or possibly even\nyour life for?' added Ms Donegan.\n' We do not condone the use of\nany drugs', said ICU President, Zoe\nHellinger.\nRector Questioned\nContinued from front page\nSign Smashed\nOne of the new direction signs in\nthe Union building was smashed\nduring the Mines Dirty Disco last\nMonday.

Sarah Payne, Secretary\nof St. Mary's Students Union, said\nthat 'they are trying to find the\npeople who did it' and added 'they\nwould try and deal with the matter\ninternally.'\nZoe' Hellinger, ICU President,\ntold Felix that she had the names of\ntwo of the St. Mary's students\ninvolved in the attempted theft. She\nexplained that the students\nconcerned had two options; either\nto pay for the damage incurred or\nto face a Union disciplinary\ncommittee. This committee has the\npower to ban students from union\npremises. If the latter fails then they\nmay face a College disciplinary\ncommittee, which could result in\nthe students being banned from\nstudying at Imperial.\ncollege, Professor Bruce Sayers,\nhas sent a letter to Mr Angus\nFraser, Managing Director of IC, on the matter. This letter was\ngenerally leaked and has been\nposted all around college. The letter\ncomplains of' brutality' and 'impertinence' in the way changes\nwere being handled. Professor\nSayers also warned of 'career\nexecutives' who had 'neither\noutstanding competence or dedication to Imperial College'.\nUnfortunately Professor Sayers was\nunavailable for further comment as\nhe was attending a World Health\nOrganisation conference at the time\nof going to press. No personnel\nfrom College administration were\nprepared to comment on the\nabrasive criticisms contained in the\nletter, except the Rector, Sir Eric Ash, who said 'I do not agree with\nthe comments' during the Rector's question time last Thursday. He added that the letter contained\n'intemperate language.' The letter\ngained a positive response from the\nunions.\nSeventy-five per cent of MSF members voted in the ballot. Sue\nSharpe, MSF Secretary, said the\nlow numbers were due to absences\nand people attending courses, not\nlack of interest. In the vote, 63 per\ncent voted for strike action while 89\nper cent voted for 'action short of\nstrike action'. Each ballot paper\ncarried a warning saying that people\ntaking industrial action may be in\nbreach of contract and that they\ncould therefore be sacked for taking\npart in a strike.\nA meeting takes place today\nbetween management and unions.\nGordon Marshall, Director of Estates, said the management\nposition has not altered and that the\nchanges were part of the College's 'restructuring and change policy'.\nHe added that he was just following\norders.\nMr Steve Newbold, the\nmanagement negotiator, said they\nwere still looking for a 'mutually\nacceptable solution'. He commented that it was 'generally\nagreed' the security structure\nneeded improving to reduce cost\nand bring it in line with the needs\nof Imperial College. He stated that\nManagement had put forward a proposal and any suggestions by\nUnions to improve the security\nsystem would be ' seriously considered'.\nEdgy Insure\nGerard Hastings will be holding an\nexhibition entitled ' On The Edge'\nin the Consort Gallery, the\nS her field Building from25 November until 19 December.\nEndsleigh Insurance are offering\ndiscounts on motor insurance to\nstudents.

Theta bearer,\nsaid that two ex R CSU students,\nDave Burns and Paul Wilmot\nattempted to remove Theta from the\nbar but were confronted by a group\nof students. When it looked as\nthough it was going to turn into a brawl, Mr. Davidson decided that\nit was probably best to let the ex-students take Theta until they could\nsit down and discuss the current\nsituation.\nOne ex-student commented 'Theta means so much to so many\npeople.. .Theta is very valuable and\nvery delicate. Playing with the new\nrules would mean that Theta would\nnot be handled with care and it may\nget broken. We don't want to see\nthat happen.'\nSimon Banton, the representative\nof the RCS Association on the\nUnion Council, said 'in my opinion\nmascot ry should have been banned\nthere and then when the guy got\nhurt (see Felix 914)... all that will\nhappen is that it will escalate again,\ncars will be re-introduced, and\nsomeone else will get hurt or\nkilled.'\nFollowing this incident six life\nmembers of the Union i are due to\nhave their memberships rescinded,\nand at the moment a temporary\nTheta is being used.\nFelix is produced for and on behalf of the Imperial College Union Publications Board and is printed by the Imperial College Union Print Unit.

The challenge\nwas played over 16 boards with the\nfollowing results obtained by Dr Mestel (playing white):\nWon12, Drawn3, Lost 1; hence\nscoring 13 and a half points out of\na possible 16.\nThe notable win was achieved by\na guest player - the secretary of the\nMiddlesex League, Bruce Birchall.\nHe had appeared to have lost his\nqueen, but soon displayed that it\nwas a cunning plan to force the\nwhite king to the centre of the board\nto be mated.\nBen Turner, the former VP of\nICU, played with remarkable flair\nand was two pawns up in the\nendgame with wonderful winning\nchances. But the 2520 ELO rated grandmaster delved into the depth\nof his experience to salvage a draw.\nAnother possible winner was\nTony Lee( Physics III), a Chess\nClub veteran. He had 2 pieces\nagainst the rook in the endgame.\nHowever he elected for the\ndignified draw after witnessing the\ndemolition and carnage around him.\nFinally a notable draw was\nachieved by Dr Karoll Seikiw of\nChemical Engineering.

Descend into the depths on\nthe largest escalators I 've ever seen\n(when they work) and you feel you\nare not going with the flow either\nof people (going in the other\ndirection) or of the foul smelling\nhurricane blowing in your face as\nthe train you've just missed pulls\nout of the station.\nThe real fun starts in the rush\nhour when half of London is going\nin the other direction and the other\nhalf wants to get onto the same train\nthat you do (which already contains\nthe population of several major\nEuropean cities). If it's breathing\nroom only standing on the platform\nthere are several methods that may\nbe adopted to get onto the train.\ndrawbacks; firstly, if someone uses\nthe same method to get off the train,\nthings get interesting, and secondly,\nyou have the cross to bear that\neveryone around thinks you have an\nIQ of around room temperature.\nThe most popular method is to\nwait in the shuffling queue until you\nget to the doors of the train and then\nshove and force your way in.\nThe sights that can be seen from\na tube carriage are varied and\ninteresting (as long as you don't look out of the windows). You can\nsee adverts for beer, newspapers,\ncharities, adult education courses,\nas well as poems and other people's necks, armpits, left eyeballs...Let's face it, I lied about the interesting\nThe first is to wait until the doors bit. And you haven't got any choice\nDoing the Tube\nhave opened, everyone who wishes\nto has disembarked and all those in\nfront of you have entered the train.\nThen politely ask if they might\nmake room for you. This is very\npolite and gives a good impression\nto any foreign tourists that may be\naround, but if you actually want to\nget from A to B you are better off\non a uni-cycle.\nThe second is to force your way\nto near the front of the crowd on the\nplatform before the train arrives and\nthen heave your way on almost\nbefore the doors have opened.\nAnyone who has ever seen a rug ger forward in the Union Bar may\nrecognise this method. It works\nsome of the time but has two\nbecause you have to coordinate\nyour breathing with those around\nyou and so moving is totally out of\nthe question.\nFinally, I would like to pose a question. Most stations are in\nobvious places; Oxford Street,\nPiccadilly Circus, Leicester Square;\nplaces that people want to go to.\nWhy is there a station at Hyde Park\nCorner? Do people want to go and\nsit in the middle of a large\nroundabout? And what about Royal\nOak\u2014the middle of a large railway\nand canal bridge. Yes, I can see\nhow that would appeal. And why is\nthere one at South Kensington?\nPaul Davison.\nPaul Davison's opinion on the\nUnderground\nDISORDER. YOU WILL BE IMMEDIATELY ATTACKED AND KILLED! Somehow they maintained a conversation while scrambling and\nrunning through the darkness.\nThe Inner System\nThe London Underground is an\nextremely convenient way to get\nfrom A to B in London, but to the\nunwary it is a minefield of hazards\nto be negotiated with skill and\ndiligence.\nOne of the first problems often\nencountered on a typical tube\njourney is find the station. Sounds\nobvious? When I first came to\nLondon it took me several attempts\nto find the actual station at Leicester\nSquare. There are about fifty-nine\nentrances (and they are always on\nthe other side of the road) with those\nwelcoming blue signs over them.\nWhen entered, however, they lead\ninto a bewildering array of tunnels.\nPeople have been known never to\nemerge...\nBuying a ticket can provide hours\nof entertainment. I always seem to\nfind myself with more 50p coins\nthan the Bank of England and no\nother change. So I join the queue\nstretching into the distance towards\nthe ticket office. If I do have the\n'exact money only' you may\nguarantee that the person in front of\nme in the queue is illiterate and will\nspend twenty minutes trying to get\na Zone 6 return, probably without\nputting any money in. And I never\ntrust those machines with my \u00a35\nnotes.\nHaving purchased a ticket it is\nthen necessary to run the gauntlet\nof the rottweilers\u2014the things with\nthe flags that chew your ticket up\nwithout letting you through. It's so\nembarrassing getting halfway\nthrough and then getting stuck.\nNow which platform do you\nStress struggled in the arms of his\ncaptor shouting incoherently.\n'Get away! Get away from it!'\n' Away from what?'\n' Away from the robot!'\n'What robot?'\nStress stopped fighting, partly\nbecause he realised that there was\nno sounds coming from the corridor\nlike rapping or gunfire and partly\nbecause he realised his captor\nholding him tightly was female. As he calmed down she let go of him\nand he crawled over in the darkness\nto the door. There was no sound\nfrom outside. Through a crack\nbelow the gaping hole he could see\nthat the corridor was empty.\n'Where did it go?'\n'Where did what go? All I heard\nwas a crash and then I saw you\ndiving into the room.' Stress crawled back from the\nshattered door to where her dim\nshape sat near a small door. He was\ncoming down from his military\nmetabolic muscle manager and\ncould only take orders.\n'What do we do now?'\nThis seemed to spark something\noff in her.\n' Follow me and you can join in\nthe plan!'\nShe motioned him to follow her\nthrough the door. They ran hunched\nin near blackness down the tunnel\nbefore it opened out in some sort of\nair lock. In the dim red light she\nopened the thick door on the far side\nof the room and walked through.\nBefore Stress entered, he tried to\nread the large notice by the door but\ngave up and carried on, unnerved\nby his pale skin and flour e scent striped aluminium jumpsuit glowing\nstrangely in the light. He was\nswallowed up in the darkness of the\ntunnel. Behind him the notice\ncontinued reading.\nYOU ARE NOW ENTERING A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT. WARNING! DO NOT ENTER IF YOU ARE PALE SKINNED, WEARING UNFASHIONABLE CLOTHES OR HAVE ANY PHYSICAL' You' re from outside the system,\naren't you?'\n' Yes, yes Iam.'' You' re a godsend! You can help\nus in our struggle against those that\ncontrol us. If you can help us\noverthrow the monsters that blight\nour lives we'd be so grateful.'\nEven in pitch darkness he\ncouldn't take his eyes off her.\n'I 'll do whatever I can.' The tunnel sloped up and she\nmotioned him to slow down. They\ncrawled to the end where two small\nwindows floated in the darkness.\nShe looked through one window\nand he looked through the other.\n'It's the newsroom.' She\nwhispered.\n6.

    "content": "2\n2 November1991 Felix 918 Opinion\nIt has been a long haul from the\nbeginning of life on Earth to the\npresent\u2014some three billion years.\nHuman history represents merely\nthe last 10,000 years at most, and\nhuman existence perhaps 2 or 3\nmillion, and mammals about 175\nmillion. The dinosaurs lasted about\n200 million years ending about 70\nmillion years ago; therefore they\nhad a reign which lasted about 100\ntimes the reign of man as top\nspecies.\nThe conceits of mankind, the\nmost outrageous of which describes\nus as made in the image of the\ncreator of the whole universe, are\na kind of working model designed\nto justify our behaviour. Our leaders have described the world as\ncreated for us alone; other species\nare to be treated as so inferior that\nwe do not have to consider their\nfeelings, which are said to bear no\ncomparison with ours which are\ninfinitely more delicate for, only we\nhave souls (whatever that may\nmean!).\nSince the industrial revolution\nand our discoveries of physics and\nchemistry, our mathematical techniques that give accurate\ndescriptions of the mechanics of\nmatter and our more recent\npenetration into the structure of life\nwhich places all biological forms\nunder one common ancestry, those\nearlier models of the universal\nheir arch y look absurd, and in many\nrespects disgraceful and certainly\nunworthy of our intellect. Many pure concepts such as truth have\nbecome comparative and idealism s such as faith have become things\nfrom which we want freedom.\nWe have discovered that\nevolution has been marvellously\ncreative: we, and all life, have been\nbeautifully integrated into what the\ndiscards the less fit varieties and\nthey become extinct. Today there\nare many estimates of the number\nof species that have become extinct\nas a result of our activities. And if\nthey do not become extinct there\nwill be no room for further\nevolution of those which survive.\nWhat we have to answer for is the\nruthlessness of the destruction we\nhave unnecessarily caused, and we\nneed to examine the methods we\nLegacy of Evolution\nVictorians called the Balance of\nNature. But an evolved system is\nstill evolving. Evolution depends on\nthe environment and its present\noccupants, and is continuing as\nrapidly as ever. But it was never\nplanned: the best we can say is that\nit happened and has arrived where\nit is now.\nHowever it has never really\narrived, but continues to travel. It\nhas no objective, but without\ncontinual changes going on in the\nenvironment and all the other\nspecies trying out their various\nmutations each species is forced to\nselect the fittest from all its current\nvarieties. This brings us to the first\ndreadful feature of its behaviour\u2014it\nOverseas Societies\nWeek Mon25th to Fri29th Nov J CR During the opening hours of the\nJCR the following Overseas\nStudents Societies will be\npresenting food stalls and video\nshows to entertain you...\nMonday Turkish, Lebanese\nTuesday Sri-Lankan, Pakistani\nScandinavian\nWednesday Malasia, Singapore, Thai,\nChinese\nThursday , Friends of Palestine,\nLatin American, Italian,\nJapan\nFriday Iranian, Indian\nhave been employing to ensure the\nsurvival of the less fit members of\nour own species.\nWe continue to employ methods\nwhich do not look at the more\ndistant consequences beyond tomorrow, beyond the next\nelection, to the lifetime of our\nchildren, our grandchildren, and\ntheir grandchildren, in fact of all or\nany of posterity. Evolution itself\ncertainly takes no thought for the\nmorrow, in spite of its creative\nsuccess up until the present. Why is this?\nIt is because we are the first\nspecies to attempt to occupy the\nwhole world at the same time. We are grabbing the whole habitat for\nourselves. That is why we destroy\nspecies, whereas true evolution\nwould only carry the competition\nwithin very limited habitats. Instead\nof allowing extravagantly evolved\nspecies to live on in remote places,\nwe have declared nowhere to be\nremote, and no other species'\nhabitat is out of bounds to us, and\nwe can eat any of the occupants we\nchoose.\nClearly this could be developed\ninto a really damning indictment of\nIndustrial Revolution Man. Shall\nwe have to prepare a defence, an\napology, or a promise of better\nbehaviour, or shall we excuse\nourselves on the grounds that we are\nmerely carrying out the techniques\nwhich creative evolution has taught\nus, and if we are a bit too efficient\nthat is evolution's fault and we have\nbeen unexpectedly good students.\nIt's a thought!\nProfessor R.S. Scorer's world\nview of the\nevolving\nbio system. "

There are 5 universities in\nthe occupied territories, all of them\nbuilt and maintained with foreign\nmoney from Arab countries. We visited the university of Bir Zeit,\nnear Ramallah, built in 1981 and\nclosed in 1988 after the Intifda. The\nstudents now study in overcrowded\nconditions in some of the old\nuniversity buildings. Before the\nIntifada the students numbered\nabout 3,500, but then many were\narrested, deported to Jordan, or\neven killed, while others dropped\nout. Now there are less than 1,500.\nSolidarity and resistance groups\nin Israel\nWe spent two days in Haifa, in\nIsrael, a city which used to be\ntotally Arabic and is still largely\npopulated by Arabs. Probably\nbecause of the presence of both\nArabs and Israelis, the pacifist\nmovement there seems politically\nmore advanced, the analysis of the\nsituation is more political and less\nhumanitarian. Here for instance the\n' Women in Black', a group of\nIsraeli women who, since the start\nof the Intifada, demonstrate against\nthe occupation with weekly vigils,\ndressed in black as a sign of\nmourning, are more politic is ed than\nin other places.\nThe Women in Black regularly\n(every Friday) picket the streets of\n18 Israeli towns, with their black\nbanners calling for a withdrawal of\nthe Israeli army from the occupied\nterritories, in the name of pacification, asking for a stop to the\nkilling on either side. We talked to\nthese women one evening, trying to\nunderstand the reasons for their\nstand and the reactions of their\nfamilies and friends. That was when\nI first realised how difficult it is to\naccept different points of view. It\nwas fine when an Israeli woman\nsaid that next year her son will\nreach the age for compulsory\nmilitary service and when he was\nPower Computing\nat Student Prices\nNow you\ncan afford\nthe choice\n20Mhz386 SX,40 MB Disk, Super\nVGA Card (1024X768),0.28 pitch\nColour Monitor, 1.2MB and\n1.4MB Floppy drives, Mini-Tower\nCase, 12 Month Warranty\nIncludes DR-DOS 6 (endorsed by IBM and Novell)\nwith disk compression that doubles drive capacity to\n80MB, built in task switcher (up to 20 tasks), the\nfastest available read-write disk cache (Super PC\nKwik), advanced memory management (up to 627K free), disk optimizer, unbreakable security system,\nOn-line manual, and postscript printer support.\n\u00a3799\nFull range of software and hardware available.

It was more\ndifficult, though, to understand an\nAmerican woman who moved to\nIsrael only 2-3 years ago, who said\nthat as an American Jew she has to\nrespond to two states: the US and\nIsrael, that's why she is in Israel,\nsupporting the Palestinian cause.\nOne Israeli woman tried to explain\nto us how difficult it must be for a17 year-old boy to choose between\n3 years in the army and 5 years in\njail for conscientious objection. But\nthen a Palestinian woman from a refugee camp in the West Bank\nanswered that often the option of a17 year-old Palestinian boy is to be\nkilled or to be tortured by the Israeli\narmy. It is not an easy dialogue, but\nit is important that it exists, and it\nis not by chance that the dialogue\nis promoted mainly by women.\nBoth Israeli and Palestinian women\nhave a common ground for their\nstruggle; violence in the family.\nWith different motivations( fru tst ration for the Palestinians,\nviolence in the army of the Jewish\nsoldiers), both worlds express their\nanger and violence against their\nWomen's organisations\nThe aims of the Women's Committees (there are 4 groups\nwhich belong to the PLO) are\nmanifold: social work consists in\ncontacting ordinary women for\nthem to rediscover their traditions;\nthey gather together, often with the\nwives of political prisoners (who\nare in need of moral, as well as\neconomic support), to do\nembroidery, sew, weave carpets,\netc., often organised in\ncooperatives, so that they also get\nsome economic help; they also run\nkindergartens and nurseries. Politically they are very active\nalong with the men, in campaigning\nfor political prisoners, for more\nrights, etc. Culturally, activities\n(such as documentation centres for\nwomen) help the creation of a new,\nemancipated, political woman, an\nacademic, intellectual leader.\nSomething that seems to be a common characteristic (we noticed\nit talking to women in Jerusalem,\nBeit Sahur, Nablus, Hebron, etc) is\nthe awareness of the mistakes made\nby other Arab anti colonialist movements (the Algerian, above\nall), where women's issues were\nignored during the national struggle\nand their lives were left unaltered\nafter independence. The Palestinian\nwomen are aware of these errors\nand don't want to repeat them:\nwhereas the ordinary women might\nhave gone back home, this hardcore group of Arab feminists have\nalready left too strong a mark to be\nsimply wiped away.\nLEBANON\nMediterranean\nSea\nDamascus\nSYRIA\nGolan\nHeights\nTel Aviv\nrI..

    "content": "2\n2 November1991 Felix 918 Letters\nThe Other Side of the Gulf\nDear Editor,\nAs chair of the meeting organised\nby the Anti-War in the Gulf Society\non the 7th November, I feel I should\nrespond to the letter from Gaby Pell\nin last week's Felix(15 th November), and defend the rights\nof any society within the Union to\ninvite whomever they wish in order\nto create debate within this\nUniversity. Gaby is correct in\nstating that ICU is apolitical,\nhowever, apolitical does not mean\nnon-political, it merely means that\nthe Union does not take any\nparticular stance on political issues.\nThis stance should not be used to\ndiscourage debate within the Union on important current issues, no\nmatter how controversial. In all\nfairness to the Union, I know of no\ncases where it has banned speakers\nin recent years, a policy I hope it\ncontinues to enact (as long as the\nUnion is not committing a criminal\noffence).\nIn the case of the above meeting\nICA WIGS decided to hold a debate\non Palestine. We took the decision\nto invite a member of the deputy\ndirector of the London office of the\nPLO, Bassem Al Jamal, for two\nreasons. Firstly, the PLO had not\nbeen given a direct voice at the\nMadrid conference, but most\nimportantly they are the\norganisation with the support of the\noverwhelming majority of the\nPalestinian people. We also invited\nJohn Gee from the Palestinian\nSolidarity Group. Nobody felt\nthreat he ned in any way. Bassem\nspoke optimistically about the future\nfor Palestine and peace in the\nregion. I heard no mention of\nde troy ing the Jewish state and\nkilling all Jews. In fact he spoke of\nhis friendship with Jewish Palestinians and the need for all\npeoples to live peacefully in the\nregion. The only angry exchanges\noccurred between myself and a member of the floor who refused to\nallow John Gee to speak without\ninterruptions after turning up three\nquarters of the way through the\nmeeting.\nI know some people regard the\nPLO as a terrorist organisation, in\nthe same way that some (including\nour Government) used to think of\nthe ANC as terrorists. Progress\ntowards peace can only be achieved\nwhen opposing sides are allowed to\ntalk without preconditions. This has\nclearly been shown in South Africa.\nAlso why should the fact that\nsomeone has spent time in a foreign\nprison mean that the person be\nbanned from ICU? Would Gaby\nwant Nelson Mandela or Andre\nSakharov banned too? Bassem's imprisonment in Israel was not an\nissue at this talk, indeed it only\ncame up during Bassem's answer to\na question from the floor. The\nreasons were not given, and it is\nwrong of Gaby to speculate.\nI'm sorry if Gaby felt threatened\nby our peaceful meeting. I'm not\nsure if anybody else did, as nobody\ncontacted us before the meeting to\nlet us know. In fact nobody made\nany objection to the meeting at all\nTen Hour Day\nDear Adam,\nAfter reading Paul Davison's letter in Felix 916 (8th Nov) about\nthe proposed lengthening of the\nCollege day, it was very clear that\nhe had totally misunderstood the\nconcept behind it.\nI agree with the first part of his\nletter, in that it does seem as if\ncertain members of the college\nadministration, and in particular Sir\nEric Ash, are blatantly ignoring the\nviews of the students in continuing\nwith the proposals.\nBut when Mr Davison sat down\nto work out that, under the proposed\nsystem, we would be working a50 hour week for a 'pay' of \u00a33,000, I fear that over-sensationalism (or\nfaulty calculator) got the better of\nhim.\nFirstly, I would be very interested\nin seeing his timetable for this\nyear\u2014ten hours a day? Ok \u2014 so that\nwas allowing for two hours for\nstudy, but I find it hard to believe\nthat he wouldn't have at least three\nor four of those remaining eight\nhours free. The whole point being\nthat the actual number of hours that\nstudents would be timetabled for\nwould be unchanged. By my\nreckoning\u2014unless Mr Davison is\nunique amongst the second year\nphysicists\u2014he does, and still would\nhave, about 18 hours timetabled per\nweek; a far cry from the figures that\nhe had suggested.\nAnd as far as doing 'a job that\npays \u00a33,000 a year', does he forget\nand we were hardly secretive about\nit, with posters and leaflets put up\nall around the main areas of the\ncollege for seven days in advance.\nI also do not feel that we\ncompromised the apolitical nature\nof the Union since the Jewish\nSociety also held a meeting on the\npeace conference the next week,\nputting forward their point of view.\nMembers of our society attended\nthis meeting and we would like to\nthank J Soc for holding the meeting\nin English rather than Hebrew so\nwe could understand and take part.\nIt is the exchange of views from\nboth sides at both the highest and\nlowest level that prop o gates peace.\nReal progress is not achieved by\ncensorship. I hope Gaby can realise\nthis and I would invite anybody to\nair any grievances they may have\nabout our society by coming along\nto our meetings held on Mondays\nat 12.45pm in the green committee\nroom.\nMany thanks,\nLee Matthews,\nTreasurer ICAWIGS.\nI like to think I'm representing the I essential quintessence of delicate |\nfemininity, its sensitivity, its beauty I and its quiet mystery; an evocation of |\nunderstated eroticism.\nYou don't think that you are merely\nprostituting your natural assets for\nthe cheap t it il ation of men over-endowed with libido?\nWell, I don't see black stockings and\nlace undergarments as prostitution as\nsuch\nSo, for you, there is no conflict\nbetween following a career in\nAstrophysics and tar ting on screen?\nn deed No. There is a great\nconfluence of themes between the\ntwo.

If he\ncame to IC for a nice job with a \u00a33,000 salary, then I'm afraid that\nhe had missed the entire point of\nfurther education, too!\nFor the record I am not in favour\nof the proposed changes, but I do\nnot find the excessive drama tis ation of the effect that they would have\nupon the number of hours worked\nhelpful to anyone, except those\nsupporting the changes who are\nlooking for evidence of a total\nmisunderstanding among the\nstudent body so they can 'justifiably' ignore our opinions.\nColin McCready, Maths 2.\nLast week a letter entitled\nTuppence Ha'penny was included,\nsigned by M Schaeffer of Maths\n2. Mr Schaeffer has contacted\nFelix disowning this letter.\nWhoever the coward was who\nhanded in the letter has sunk to an\nappalling depth. I rely on trust to\na great extent when accepting\nletters.

Out of these three\npeople, an eternal triangle is\nformed.\nCelia loves Martin, almost to the\npoint of worship, staying with him despite his callous treatment of her.\nMartin needs Andy, as the only\nperson he trusts, trusting him absolutely. Andy lusts after and\nfalls in love with Celia.\nAdded to this complexity is\nMartin's fanatical devotion to the\ntruth; nobody must lie to him about\nwhat they see, as they are his eyes.\nHis world falls apart when Celia\nblackmails Andy into lying to\nMartin, and the triangle breaks.\nCinematographically, the film\ncould be far better. Proof is visibly\nlow budget, with bland, uninteresting camera work. Acting\nis reasonable, with adequate\nperformances from all but\nGenevieve Pico t who was\noutstanding. Her ability and the\nexcellent writing and direction of\nJocelyn Moorhouse makes the film\nworthwhile. Her insight into human\nnature is wonderful and the\ncharacters are given true depth. She\nhas also managed to fill the film\nwith blind humour - jokes against\nthe sighted - and beautiful insights\ninto the life of the blind.\nThis film has inspired me to the\nextent that I went blind for 24 hours\nduring Rag Week. If you think that\nI was being a little extreme, then tell\nme so, but see Proof first. Proof\nwill be on limited release from the\n29th November.\nStef. Martin (Hugo Weaving) was born\nwith a chip on his shoulder. When his mother used to describe a scene\nto him, he would challenge her,\ntelling her that she was lying. When\nshe questioned him as to why she\nwould lie, the angry response would\nbe 'Because you can'.\nThe truth was that she could have\nlied to him. Martin could never\nverify what his mother told him about the things she saw, for one\nsimple reason. He was blind.\nMartin started carrying a camera\naround with him, so that he could\nphotograph the things that he heard\nand smelt, as ' proof to those who\ncould see.\nInterwoven with this insecure and\nangry character are two other\npeople. Celia (Genevieve Picot) and\nAndy( Russell Crowe). Celia is\nK2\n' K2' is the film based on the Tony award-winning stage play of the\nsame name by Patrick Meyers. It\nhas all the essential conflicts to\nmake up an enthralling adventure\nepic, man vs. man, man vs nature,\nman vs himself. Somehow,in the\ntransformation from stage to screen\nit lost some of the spark.\nIt centres on two men who are\nclimbing what is possibly the Most\nDangerous Mountains in the World,\nthe Karakoram Mountain Range,\nK2 for short. They face all the life-threatening dangers of the\nmountains, and find out much about\nthemselves along the way. Michael\nBiehn plays obnoxious Attorney\nTaylor Brooks who lives for risks,\nin the courtroom, in bed, and most\nespecially on the mountains. He says at the very beginning of the\nplay that' Ya gotta keep taking risks\nin this life. You stop taking risks,\nyou're dead.' His friend Harold\nJaimeson, played by Matt Craven,\nis at the other end of the spectrum.\nHe is a physicist who takes both his\nwork and his family very seriously.\nHe is however just as addicted to\nclimbing mountains as Taylor is,\nbut for completely different\nreasons. He is the epitome of the\nperson who scales a mountain to be\n'closer to god'. As he asserts there\nis that split moment right when you\nget to the top of the mountain in\nwhich all the answers become clear,\nand just as soon afterwards the\nworldly concerns come crashing\ndown and its time to climb back\ndown into it. However this split\nsecond is extremely addictive, and\nhe keeps climbing. The addiction is\nabout the only thing that these two\nmen have in common. Given the\nopportunity to climb this mountain\nis something each of them had\ndreamed of, but never expected to\nhappen. When it does, they jump at\nthe chance.\nThe joys of the film are the\nclimbing sequences with spectacular\ncinematography, and nail-biting\nscenes of literally cliff-hanging\ndanger. However, it may rely too\nmuch on this part and neglect that\nthe film is supposed to be\n'character-driven' and an analysis\nof the relationships involved. The acting is mediocre, which can't happen with a script as stilted as this\none without a loss of sympathy on\nthe part of the audience for the\ncharacters. However, there is one\nactress that is absolutely magnificent in her splendour, that\nis the mountain. And if you want\nyour breath taken away by the cruel\nbeauty of nature then definitely see\nit in the theatre, otherwise, wait\nuntil it's out on video.\nThe Token American Editorial\nHi Reader peoples!

    "content": "Letters Felix 918 22 November1991 State Terror Won't Let Go\nDear Adam,\nReferring to last week's letter by\nGaby Pell protesting against the\nparticipation of a member of the\nPLO in a meeting of the AntiWar in the Gulf Society, we would like\nto raise the following points.\nFirst, a reminder that the PLO represents at least 7 0 % of the\nPalestinians in a recent survey and\nas such they cannot be denied their\nrightful place in any such meetings.\nSo long as the Palestinians have no\nrights to vote for the people they\nwant in the occupied territories, the\nPLO has to be taken as their\nrepresentative.\nSecondly, any terrorist act is\ndeplorable and should be\ncondemned. However, the present\nviolence is being committed by both\nsides. There have been more\nPalestinians killed over the past\nthree years than Israelis killed. If\nanything, it is the state of Israel\nwhich should renounce violence and\nstate terror against unarmed Palestinian civilians. The restoration of a Palestinian state is\nonly right, considering the horrendous injustices of the past ten\nyears.\nThirdly, in any useful discussion\nthere must be voices from all\nopinions. Trying to exclude a member of the PLO from the\nmeeting would make complete\nnonsense of the very claim that\nImperial College is 'apolitical'. We suspect that Gaby Pell's definition\nof being 'apolitical' is plucked right\nout of Israeli government policy,\nwhich is to ignore and exclude the\nPLO from any peace process/\ndiscussion.\nFinally, Imperial College must\ncontinue to let all shades of political\nopinions flourish.\nYours sincerely,\nHo Yin Wong, Physics PG,\nTobias Schrag, Physics PG.\nDouble\nDutch\nDross\nDear Editor,\nI find the theoretical Physics\ncourses rather like learning Portuguese from an instructor who\nspeaks only Portuguese. By the time\nyou have picked up enough of the\nlanguage to understand him at all,\nyou realise he is so far ahead of you\nthat you will never catch up.\nYou can't even ask him questions, such as the meaning of a simple word. He will describe it\nin terms of more difficult words and\nphrases, that you can't learned until\nyou have learnt the simple ones.\nPerhaps, in view of the symbols\nused, I should have said not\nPortuguese but Greek!\nYours sincerely,\nPeter Taylor.\nDear Adam,\nThe mascot ry rules were changed\nrecently to make this tradition raise\nmore money for Rag and involve\nmore people. A group of ex R CSU students objected to this change as\nthe new rules meant that the mascot,\npreviously un violated for seventeen\nyears would almost certainly be\nstolen during Rag Week.\nThey are no longer involved in the running of R CSU and certainly\ndon't give a toss about current\nstudents, so they resorted to\nbullying tactics to get their own\nway. No wonder the R CSU has\nsuch a crap image with people like\nthat hanging around.\nDear Editor,\nSex is legal at twelve. Drinking\nis legal at sixteen. Alcohol is sold\nat all hours. Cannabis is legal.\nDutch law, whether right or wrong,\nsounds brilliant.\nAll the things that would make\nmany Imperial College students\nsmile. The difference is that in\nEngland:' Class B drugs eg. amphetamines, barbiturates and\ncannabis, depending on whether it's possession or supply and production, can give you anything\nfrom a three month prison sentence\nand/or a \u00a3500 fine to five years\nand/or an unlimited fine'.

We're ty ring our best but\nbelieve it or not we're also trying\nto get good degrees as well, so we\nsimply don't have time to put it all\nright straight away.

Also in\nattendance were Angus Fraser,\nCollege Managing Director, Gordon Marshall, Director of\nEstates, John Archer, College ProRector and Steven Newbold, Director of Marketing.\nQuestioning started on the\nfinancial stability of the College.\nThis was described as 'stable' by\nthe Rector, but he added that the\nreserves were' zilch'. The replacement of present Security\nstaff with outside contractors was\ndescribed as part of the continuing\neffort to run College in a more cost\neffective manner.\nThe Rector believed that the\nnumber of university students\nnationwide needed to be increased,\nbut that this could not happen with\n'the generous UK maintenance\nterms'. He felt that a 'better way\nwas a graduate tax', but he\ndisapproved of any system that led\nto students being forced to live at\nhome. He said that 'within some\nlimits a certain amount of working\nthrough College is acceptable',\nciting the USA as an example. He described students' summer benefits\nas 'diabolical.'\nThe Rector was asked why the\nCollege ignored student's views on\nthe extension of the College Day.\nHe responded T don't think it did' and criticised last year's referendum\nas a 'would-you-like-to-get-up-earlier' question. He claimed that\nthe longer day would use resources\nmore efficiently and although all\nUniversity of London colleges\nwould soon start at 9.00am, he' could foresee '8.00am lectures by\nthe year 2000.'\nHe said that there would be more\nacademic staff on outside contracts\nin College, but he refused to be\ndrawn on the matter of security\nstaff. He would not pass the\nquestion on to the members of the\nmanagement staff who were\npresent, saying that this session was\nthe Rector's Question time.\nThe question-time ended with the\nICU President, Zoe Hellinger,\nfl anning the Rector for Rag.

This would involve a college-wide referendum.\nUnions Move\nStaff members of the\nManufacturing Science and Finance\nTrade Union ( MSF) at Imperial\nCollege will be taking industrial\naction on Wednesday 4 December,\nin protest at the recent decision to\ncontract out the work of the\nmessengers and security guards to\na private company.\nThe decision to strike was taken\nby an MSF meeting yesterday after\na strike ballot which gave 63 per\ncent support for industrial action.\nOther unions have also reacted to\nthe move by high level College\npersonnel. N UP E( the National\nUnion for Public Employees) released a provisional result of 80\nper cent support for strike action,\nfrom a poll of their members earlier\nthis week. In a newsletter produced\nthis week, the AUT( Association of\nUniversity Teachers) has instructed\nmembers not to cross picket lines\nor to do work meant for other staff.\nDr. Taylor Russell of the AUT expressed 'horror and incredulity'\nat the management action. The AUT action was described as\n'extraordinary' by Derek Dollard,\nPresident of MSF, at a meeting of his union yesterday. Mr Dollard\nsaid that the AUT had never\nsupported a strike in College\nbefore.\nThe MSF strike will take place on\nthe same day as a meeting of the\nGoverning Body of Imperial College, in order to lobby opinion\nin the meeting against the cuts.

Mat and Nick had been\nin various groups in Winchester,\nbut felt they were going nowhere.\nIt was decided that a move to\nLondon was called for. Once there\na demo tape was sent to a friend of Hamish's, Hamish liked it, they met\nup and Revolver were born.\nCrimson is only their second\nsingle release and continues the\ndevelopment of the 45 ep. But why\nHut records?\n'There was a guy at one of our\ngigs with a stupid smile on his face',\nreplied Hamish, the quiet one of the\npair. He was really getting into the\nmusic, and kept smiling at Hamish\nas he played the bass. They had no\nidea he was from a record company, and in fact were intending\nto sign to another label at the time.\nAfter the gig he approached them\nand spouted out how great it had\nbeen, what a fantastic group they\nwere and, who were they going to\nsign to? T didn't want to say\nanything, in case he was from a record company', continued Mat. One thing lead to another and they\nsigned to Hut.\nThey both said how great it was\nto be looked after by somebody that\nliked everything they did, not\nautomatically but because they\nactually liked it. The one time it was\nthought that a track needed remixing so did the band. T still think\nthe drums should be louder' added\nMat.\nAsked what they thought about\nthe current music scene they\nresponded with two points.\nFirstly, the way people are so\nprotective about the whole 'indie'\nthing, the way people say you can't have creative freedom inside a major label. It's like when people\ncomplained when Carter moved to\nChrysalis from Bad Cat people said\nthey'd sold out. No band has moved\nto a major label and suddenly turn\ncrap, changed their clothes. The whole music scene is becoming too\ncompartment ali sed, people feel like\nthey have to be protective about\ntheir music.\nSecondly, the way that 'indie'\nwomen dress. 'They always wear\nc lumpy boots', I offered. ' Yes, and\nflowery dresses'. Not the most\nattractive people in the world it\nmust be said.\nAnd then I died up, floundering\nlike a whale on the beach I resorted\nto something I had promised my self\nI wouldn't,' The Scene'. Sorry.\n'We don't talk about it apart from\nin interviews'. Let's get one thing\nstraight, they don't sound anything\nlike Moose, their label-mates,\nChapterhouse don't sound like\nMoose or Revolver, they're all\ndifferent. When out and about it\nwould be stupid of them to ignore\na friend now that they are in a group\nthemselves, wouldn't it? \u2022\n'The guitar styles are completely\ndifferent'. This is obvious to even\nthe most casual listener to Crimson\nor the 45 ep. The four tracks that\nmake up the ep are varied in style,\nyet they still remain neatly bounded\ninto a complete whole. Its a great\nrecord, almost a mini album.\nI asked them if they had changed\nduring their short life together?\n'Every time we play we try and\nmake things a little different', they\nanswered. Sometimes they even\nchange the words. Does anybody\nnotice I wondered, or only the\nmembers of the group. For the rest\nof the song Mat is half singing, half\nlaughing the lyrics.\n'With the first ep we had four\ntracks and know exactly what we\nwanted to do with them', Mat continued, 'but with this one we\nonly had one and a half. The other\ntwo were made up in the studio and\nare perhaps the best tracks on the\nrecord.\n' You' ve got this reputation for\nbeing arrogant, do you think you\ndeserve it?'\nTheir response was to ask why,\nwho had told me? I couldn't really\nanswer, it was more a feeling, a general vibe, nothing specific. They\nare young and enthusiastic, its very\neasy to mistake that for arrogance,\nespecially if you want to. Take the\nManic Street Preacher (please) now\nthey are arrogant for no reason at\nall. Revolver don't say they've\nproduced the best records ever, or\neven of this year, but see them as\na start, a beginning to start from.\nIt may be a long road but when they\nreach the end the results will be\nmore than worth it.\nCompletely running out of questions I asked them 'have you anything else to say?'\n'Both of us have blue eyes'\nPebbles chats\nabout music,\nwomen and\ncolors\nRevolver Interview\n\n"

    "content": "Feature Felix 918 2\n2 November1991 Introduction\nI participated in a two-week tour of\nthe occupied territories and Israel\norganised by an Italian pacifist\norganisation. I was one of seventeen\nwomen. The aim of the tour was to\nvisit these 'difficult' places, and\nworked by an Israeli, they have no\ninsurance, no health assistance, no\npension and if they injure\nthemselves in the working place\nthey even risk losing their jobs. A Palestinian female worker has one\nmonth maternity leave, while an\nPalestine Journey\nAnna Gigli\nvisited Israel\nlast August and\nnow reports on\nthe state of\nwomen and\nstudents in the\ncountry. Edited\nby Natalia\nKarapanagioti.\nmeet the people, especially women,\nwho are fighting against the Israeli\noppression both in the occupied\nterritories and Israel.\nThere are approximately two\nmillion Palestinians living in the\noccupied territories of West Bank\nand Gaza strip, almost half of them\nare refugees from 1948 registered\nwith the U NRW A( United Nations\nRelief and Works Agency).\nWorkers\nBesides some small Palestinian\nfirms and cooperatives of women\n(producing things like biscuits,\nyogurt, carpets, embroidery) the\nmajority of Palestinians either work\nin agriculture, are unemployed or\nwork in Israel. Up to 1990 most of\nthe Palestinian workers were\nallowed to travel to Israel, although\nthey were not officially permitted\nto stay there overnight. Some of\nthem used to be locked up at night\nby their employers, instead of daily\ncommuting from the West Bank,\nwhilst only a minority were given\na green card that forbade them to\nenter Israel.\nThe Palestinians from the\noccupied territories who work in\nIsrael do not have the same rights\nas their Israeli fellows: even though\nthey pay the same taxes, and work\n46 hours against the 40 hours\nIsraeli female worker gets three\nmonths.\nMeanwhile, the bureaucracy\nmakes *it very difficult to obtain\npermission to open a firm in the\noccupied territories, and it is not\npossible for a Palestinian, not even\nfor farmers, to trade directly with\nother states (for instance Arab states\nor Europe) without passing through\nIsrael. They cannot even sell their\ngoods to Israel, unless they are\nofficially required by Israel itself,\nand in that case it is Israel that fixes\nthe price. The farmers have not\nmuch choice: either the poor\ninternal market or Israel.\nLand confiscation\nAnother problem that the\nPalestinian farmers face is the land\nconfiscation, in order to make room\nfor new settlements. This happens\nboth in the occupied territories and\nin Israel.\nWe learned that there are 122\nillegal Arab villages in Israel, a total\nof 75,000 people who live in places\nthat are not recognised by the state.\nThere is no one Arab village where\nthere has not been land expropriation.\nSchools and universities\nEducation is another sector where\nPalestinians have experienced\nstrong repression from the Israeli\nstate. Schools in the occupied\nterritories are divided into three\ntypes: U NRW A, private and\ngovernment schools.\nU NRW A schools are specifically\nfor the refugee camps. They provide primary education for\neverybody, although it is very\ndifficult for a student from a refugee\ncamp to continue into secondary\nschool.\nPrivate schools are run by\nreligious organisations (Muslim or\nChristian) or by other organisations\n(for example Women's Committees\nrun most of the nursery schools).\nSome of the private schools are run\nby the PLO, under the cover of\nreligious schools (the PLO is\nbanned and belonging to or coming\nin contact with the organisation\nmeans six months to 15 years in\njail). They get the money to run\ntheir schools from Jordan. After the\n1967 occupation Israel wanted to\nenforce an Israeli syllabus, but\nteachers refused. Up to now they\nteach a Jordain syllabus in the West\nBank and an Egyptian syllabus in\nthe Gaza strip. One role of the\nGeneral Union of Palestinian\nTeachers ( G UP T), among others, is\nto train teachers to defy censorship.\nIn fact, in the occupied territories\n2,200 books are banned (from\nShakespeare's Hamlet, to those of\nthe Brazilian Jorge Amado and all\nPalestinian writers and poets),\nalthough these same books are sold\nin Israel. Possession of illegal\nliterature means up to six months in\njail, 'but the biggest loss', said one\nteacher, a leader of the G UP T in\nJerusalem, 'are the books they took\naway from us'.\nGovernment schools make up\nmore than 7 0 % of the schools on\nthe West Bank. The biggest\nproblem is caused by the current\nclosure of schools (last year they\ntaught from between 40 to 110\ndays, out of the ordinary 240 days),\nand the imprisonment or dismissal\nof teachers. The government tend\nto employ temporary teachers, who\nare more vulnerable and more\neasily controlled. Although Palestinian education standards\nhave always been considered higher\nthan any other Arab state\n(Palestinians have the highest of\ngraduate students among all the\nArab countries), several factors are\ncontributing to the lowering of those\nstandards: at the beginning of the\nIntifada all schools were closed for\n18 months, and after the first 3\nmonths of underground teaching a new law made even this illegal and\nteachers risked between 6 months\nto 10 years of prison; teachers in\ngovernment schools are not allowed\nto belong to the Union or attend\nvarious events, like training courses\n\u2014 8 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "2\n2 November1991 Felix 918 Feature\nThe word' calligraphy', in whatever language, generally refers\nto a group of characters which\nexpresses the human thoughts, but\nnever has it received the status of\nbeing an art as in China.\nIt is generally thought that the\nhistory of Chinese calligraphy is as\nold as the history of China itself.\nAlthough westerners know a lot\nabout Chinese painting and other\nfine arts, they have a very vague\nidea about the nature of Chinese\ncalligraphy. In addition, not only is\nChinese calligraphy the essential\nform of all Chinese art, it is the\nmost basic element from which\nChinese art originates. Unfortunately, however, unless one is\nbrought up in the tradition and\ninfluence of Chinese art, it is almost\nimpossible to learn and master\nChinese calligraphy. In order to\nunderstand Chinese calligraphy,\none has to learn the history of the\nformation of some characters, as\nwell as acquiring the ability to write\nthem. This is because the ways the\ncharacters are written not only\ncommunicate and exchange ideas\nwith the calligrapher (and indeed\neveryone), but also convey an\naesthetic element, usually abstract,\nthrough visual perception.\nThe relationship between Chinese\ncalligraphy and the daily lives of the\nChinese people is inseparable.\nWalking in the streets in this\ncountry, one notices that most of the\ncalligraphy on the signboards of\nadvertisements seems to be similar\nin style: they are neat, regular and\nbalanced, but also, however, lacking in dynamism. By contrast,\nin areas where there is an\naccumulation of Chinese shops,\ncalligraphy can be seen displayed\neverywhere. Apart from the\nsignboards, one finds that the\ninterior of almost every restaurant,\nbusiness centre and shop is adorned\nwith examples of calligraphy work.\nThese characters have three main\nvalues: their decorative quality,\nadvertising capabilities and most\nimportantly, their attractiveness to\nthe appreciative audience.\nA passion and love for the written\nword has long been Cultivated in the\nsoul of every Chinese youngster.\nThe education that they received\nteaches them not to tear up any\nwritten work and not to use\nimproper writing-paper, not even a piece of waste paper. In fact, in\nevery region of China, even the\npoorest village, towers and pagodas\nare built specially for burning\nwritten examples of calligraphy in\na respectful manner. The Westerners find this hard to\ncomprehend. The tradition shows\nclearly the degree of respect in\nwhich the Chinese hold the written\nword.\nAs most businessmen will tell\nyou, a well written signboard can\nbring luck and fortune.\nConsequently, they are very willing\nto pay a large sum of money in\nexchange for a fine piece of work.\nOnce the name of the shop has\nfinished being written, a grand\nceremony will be held before the\nshop sign is put in the final position.\nThe Chinese believe that\npersonality, disposition, tempera-ment, hobbies and even the degree\nof success of a person can be told\nfrom their calligraphy. For example\none can imply from the works of\nEmperor Hui Zon g of the Sung\nDynasty (AD960-1297) that he was\nhandsome, tall and slim in\nappearance, but also irresolute.\nDuring the long years between\nthe Tang and Qing Dynasty( AD618-1919), Imperial examinations (usually set on the Confucian\ndoctrines) was the only way by\nwhich one can embark on an official\ncareer. From this point of view,\ncalligraphy is not only the most\nbasic but also the most important\nrequirement. No scholar would\nhave been awarded a job, not even\nthe most magnificent essay writer,\nhad calligraphy been 'not good\nenough'. Even nowadays, the\nability to write aesthetically pleasing\ncalligraphy plays an important role\nin one's social life. Equally remarkable to the Westerner may be\nthe fact that a lot of the friendship\nis built simply on the basis of\ndistinguished handwriting reflecting the degree of admiration\none shows to people who are\ntalented in calligraphy! If a Chinaman cannot write his\ncharacters well, no doubt he will\nfind it very difficult to find a job,\neven in the era of the invention of\nChinese computer.\nIn China, calligraphy is the most\ncommon of art forms. It is a nationwide hobby, a kind of\n'natural appreciation of beauty',\nwhich is cultivated in every child in\nthe ' Land of Gods'. At certain\nstages in China's history, many\nscholars have become 'fanatic'\nabout Chinese calligraphy, much\nmore so than about drawing, for\nexample, Scholars expert ed in the\ndisciplines of art, song, poetry were\nnot commonly found throughout\nChina's history, whereas elegant\nand brilliant calligraphers could be\nfound everywhere and at any time\nin the history of China. Most literature and art, however, they\nfind a sense of satisfaction when\nthey look at a fine example of the\nart of calligraphy.\nIf this is the case with you, why\ndon't you have a go yourself?\nA live demonstration of Chinese\ncalligraphy will be presented at\n'Malaysian Variety Show', 22nd February1992. Everyone is\nwelcome.\nChinese Calligraphy\nFreedom and Democracy\nExtracts from\n'Chinese\nCalligraphy' by\nChiang Yee,\ntranslated by\nHan Mien Kho.\n\u2014 i \u2014\n\n"
