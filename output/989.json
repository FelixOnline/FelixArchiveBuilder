    "content": "Opinion 23\n\u00abl3 Pi4 2 .\nMaking enemies of Buju Banton and Shabba\nmust be a legitimate reason for even he t ero men\nto start shaving their legs and squeezing into\nlittle Chanel cocktail dresses. These fascist\nmatriarchs whose trade mark decadence and\nobject if i cation of women could popular is e them\nto demi-god status with any Neo-Nazi activist\ngroup or IC drinking club, save for their little\noversight of not being quite Caucasian enough.\nMy own sexuality having been called into\nquestion by four separate people in recent times\nleaves one with the temptation to simply say:\n\"Yes, I am.\" I doubt myself often enough,\nparticularly with the allure of gay culture as\nstrong as it is. The best clubs are gay. Not\nsimply because of their frenzied freedom and the\nuninhibited 'freak-out' manner in which they are\napproached, but the happy nature, the lack of\npissed bastards out to badger women into bed\nand, of course, the kitschy music make it an\nintimidation-free night out. Gay pubs, immersed\nwith good humour (Kings and Queens on the lav\ndoors. Take your pick!) and cheap ale, are again\neasy places to go simply to watch people. But\nwhat do you see? Gay men on the pull are very\neasy to spot: they approach their quarry (often as\nobviously receptive as they themselves are\ninquisitive) exchange a few words and a new\nfriend is made. None of the fear and 'my friend\nfancies your friend' shenanigans of the breeding\npopulation, or none from my limited view of\ntheir world at least.\nThis is essentially what inspires my envy of\nhomosexuals. Having thrown caution to the\nwind and announced to the world, their friends\nand family that their likelihood of marriage is\nrather slimmer than they may have hoped, they\ngo out and enjoy themselves. It is as if they want\nto make up for the time they have lost in the\nhe t ero master-race.\nI wish I could be as confident, uninhibited\nand free as the gay men I have met and chatted\nto; but I cannot. I am a cog in the he t ero breeding wheel and there is nothing I can do\nabout it. Keanu Reeves does nothing for me and\nunfortunately not a single tear could I muster at\nthe sad demise of River. I am trapped in the cold\nsweats produced by the feminine touch and\naddled by idiotic games that are required of me\nfor a regular dosage. But on Wednesday nights I can be found in the Powder Room at Heaven in\nCharing Cross, watching the TVs bitch each\nothers eyeliner and trying to make some sort of\nsense of the whole spectacle.\nIf that is the sort of sentiment that inspires\nyou to violence, then examine the reason why. Is\nit the perceived submissive ness of gays that\ngives you the confidence you require to take one\non? Or the basic fear of being gay yourself and\nthe social ostracism that would follow it? Why is\nit that weakness is always dubbed being queer?\nIs it a re-enforcement of your own masculinity,\nor reassurance to your confused mind? I can't decide for you, but remember how much guts it\nwould take you to bring this hatred down upon\nyourself. Far more, I think, than clubbing\nsomeone to death with baseball bats because\nthey chose to be different to you.\nSo girlfriend...YOU BETTA WORK!\nGlyph\nThe Concreteers Of Your Dreams\nDear Felix,\nWhen I came to Imperial I was prepared for\nthe fact that the phrase \"Hello, I'm studying\nMechanical Engineering\" wasn't going to be the\nbest chat-up line in the world. I wasn't however,\nprepared for the vehemence of contempt people\nhold towards engineers, not just outside, but also\nwithin, this College. I feel compelled to ask why\nthis is the case.\nThe first problem is that engineering is\nessentially politically incorrect. Engineers build\nmotorways and power stations. They pollute and\ndestroy. Engineering only reaches the news\nwhen people campaign against it, when\n'environmentalists' protest at the unnecessary\ndestruction of our landscape. (Unnecessary, even\nthough these same protesters undoubtedly drive\nto the protest site and probably brew cups of tea\nduring advert breaks thus necessitating extra\npower stations.)\nYes, engineering work has polluted, has\nkilled, has maimed - but these are mistakes to be\nlearned from, mistakes which can be rectified by\nthe engineers to build a better world.\nThe other problem is that engineering,\napparently, is boring. OK, it frequently is, but it\nneed not be. Look, for instance, at Calatrava's bridges; compare the French and British channel\ntunnel terminals. Why is the European terminal\nso beautiful and the British so mundane? In this\ncase it is the politics which are to blame. The\nGovernment is not prepared to pay for great,\nbeautiful structures and we are left with\nfunctional objects instead of glorious temples to\ntechnology. (Recently, for instance, a memorable Calatrava design for the new East\nLondon river crossing was rejected in favour of\na cheaper, but worthless, design.)\nIronically, the only area in which nationally\nfunded engineering is supported properly is the\nMilitary - where many of the most exciting new\ndevelopments are being made. The Government\nis prepared to kill people in the most advanced\nand inspirational manner possible, but will not\nfund machines which enhance life, rather than\ndeath.\nTo add insult to irony, one might notice that\nthose environmentalists who are so vocal about\nthe extinction of some pretty butterfly by a motorway fly-over are strangely silent about the\nGovernment's love of aesthetic death machines.\nCould it be that their love life is restricted to\nthemselves and their country, whereas the wilful\nkilling of foreigners is laudable?\nSurely we have reached a stage in the\ndevelopment of the world when such\nnationalism is a dangerous absurdity and the\nonly sensible way forward is internationalism.\nSurely it is time that we stopped glorifying\nourselves at the expense of others and worked\nfor a better world?\nAnd, once the political bickering has ceased,\nwho better to attempt to achieve this\nmonumental task than those maligned\nconcrete ers of dreams, the Engineers.\nYours, somewhat rambling ly, Marcus Alexander,\nMech Eng 2.\nApplications for re-applicant places in IC\nresidences for the 1994-5 session are now invited.\nPlease note that these places are for people who will help run the social programme for fresher s at\nthe start of next session. You are unlikely to be selected unless you played a prominent part in the\nsocial life of your hall. Application forms can be obtained from the wardens.\nThe deadline is Friday 25th February.\nArticles Deadline: Friday, 6pm Letters Deadline: Monday, 6pm "

Yet last\nSaturday's glorious sunshine provided a sense of\nspring like optimism before the league match\nagainst Royal Free Hospital (RFH). However, it\ntakes only one second to score a goal, and after\njust two minutes, RF H had scored two, in the\nstyle of Bryan Robson in 1982 and San Marino\nsomewhat more recently.\nWith cool heads and brave hearts, IC 2nds started to spin a cobweb of passing around the\nhapless medics. They were soon rewarded with a goal by a orderly header by Dennis Nadarajah\noff a precisely delivered corner kick by the still\nunshaven Abs Said. A few minutes later Billal\nAl-Quitab, playing with a six million dollar\nknee, equalise d for Imperial in a carbon copy\nmove of the preceding goal, opening the\nfloodgates of memory to Brazil's first two in the\n1958 World Cup final.\nIt was a tough afternoon at Harlington. Rob\nFranolic, imported from Wimbledon, battled\nhard in defence; East End hard-man Nadarajah\njumped into all potentially volatile confrontations with the opposition, in the fashion of\nthe excitable Stelike who played for Real\nMadrid and West Germany; and Matteo Farina\ntried his best to be sent off, in an attempt to\nemulate his childhood hero, the notorious\nClaudio Gentile of Italy. Disgusted at the\nreferee's lack of attention, Farina eventually\nwalked off the pitch voluntarily.\nDespite their continued efforts, IC were\nunable to score and frustration, tired limbs, and\nfading concentration soon merged to form a disastrous cocktail of vulnerability. RF H scored\nfour more goals. However, as Socrates explained\nto his colleagues after he missed a vital penalty\nagainst France in 1986; life is like an April day,\na little sun, a little rain, and the night steals\nacross the plain.\nWe want YOU to stand for the prestigious post\nof Rag Mag Editor 1994.

    "content": "News\nPresident's Underdevelopment Burglary\nmm\nThe Sherfield Walkway: before and after.\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nThe promised development of retail\npremises on the Sherfield walkway\n(Felix 979) has been delayed.\nThe plans to improve services on\nthe walkway were approved by the\nManagement Planning Committee\n(the top advisory body at Imperial\nCollege) last term. Union President,\nAndrew Wensley, speaking to\nFelix, had estimated that the plans\nwould be ready after Christmas. He\nhas now said that the plans will be\nfinished by the end of March.\nAccording to Mr Wensley, the\ndelay is due to \"clarification on\nissues such as fire regulations\". He\nsaid that the development is now\nbeing handled between the Union\nand the College Estates division.\nInvestigations are also being\nmade into the disappearance of\nposters from the walkway.\nSeveral groups, including the\nCity and Guilds College Union\n(C& GCU), complained at the last\nUnion Executive meeting that\nposters they had placed on the\nnoticeboards along the walkway\nhad been removed.\nIt was suggested that the posters\nPhoto: Ivan Chan\nhad been deliberately removed, but\nit is possible that they had merely\nbeen blown down by the wind and\ncleared up. Charles Leary, Deputy\nPresident (Clubs and Societies)\ncommented: \" ICU is aware that\ncertain posters have been taken\ndown and we will be investigating.\"\nThe Union would like to point\nout that the chocolate machine in\nthe foyer of the Union Building\nnow charges 25p for each bar of\nchocolate. The refilling of the\nmachine has been taken over by the\nUnion, so it will also be restocked\nmore frequently.\nColleges To Enter Stock Market\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nThe Committee of Vice Chancellors\nand Principals (CVCP) has revealed\nplans for universities to enter the\nstock market in order to raise extra\nincome. A group of approximately\nten universities is heading the\nscheme which would involve\nsetting up a financial consortium to\ndeal with investments. Institutions\nwould guarantee these investments\nwith their property (including\ncampuses).\nA financial adviser has been\nappointed to produce the detailed\nplans for the scheme, which has\nbeen approved by both the\nDepartment for Education and the\nHigher Education Funding Council.\nA spokesman for the CVC P commented: \"The new company\nwill employ people who know what\nthey are doing, rather than dabbling\nin an amateurish way. Universities\nwould have to put up money to\nbecome shareholders. It is a form of\nprivatisation.\n\"The function [of the company]\nwould be to enable universities and\nother higher education institutions\nto raise funds from the capital\nmarkets.\n\"The blueprint may well give\nrise to a need to re-examine the\nTreasury's restrictions on universities' powers to borrow against\ntheir assets.\"\nUniversities have set up an\nadvisory group to take care of the\nscheme, chaired by Sir William\nFraser, the principal of Glasgow\nUniversity. The group also includes\nrepresentatives from the Department of Education.\nImperial College is, as yet, not\ndirectly involved in the scheme.\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nThe College Conference Office in\nSouthside suffered a burglary over\nthe weekend.\nThe break-in, discovered on\nMonday morning, involved the\ntheft of equipment worth over\n\u00a33,500, including fax machines and\na laser printer. The office appears\nto have been entered by the\nremoval of a small panel of glass in\nthe door (allowing access to the\nlock). The burglars left no sign of\nentry on the outside of the building.\nCollege Security are requesting\nanyone who has seen anything\nsuspicious in the Southside area to\ncontact them. They can be found in\nthe entrances of most departments.\nAlong with other incidents, the\nburglary has prompted a fresh\ncampaign to cut down on easy\ntargets for theft. From now on,\nSecurity will regularly be checking\nfor unlocked and unattended\nrooms; those found will be logged.\nA reminder to lock the room will\nalso be left.\nThe thefts have also raised the\npossibility of College making it\ncompulsory to wear swipe cards in\nthe College grounds. Security are\nrecommending that people wear\ntheir cards around College to help\ncombat petty crime.\nOutlook\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nEmployment prospects are on the\nup for this years graduates, according to a report by Incomes Data\nServices (IDS). The document,\nprinted this week, estimated that\nemployers will increase their\nrecruitment of graduates by 16\npercent this year.\nThe IDS also claim that salaries\nfor recently recruited graduates are\nincreasing by more than ten per\ncent, compared with rises of the\nrest of the workforce of about two\nper cent.\nThe reasons given by employers\nfor the upturn forecast in the\ndemand for graduates is an\nincreased economic confidence and\na belief that the worst of the job-cutting exercises are over.\nHowever, the report cautions\nagainst \"over-optimism\", arguing\nthat most employers are simply\nreturning to 1992 levels of\nrecruitment.\nDeadline for Access Fund applications is 25th February\n\n"

    "content": "Union 21\nNominations, Campaigns, Elections . . .\nMonday 14th February. Valentine's Day and the\nstart of the '94 Imperial College Union\nSabbatical Elections. The posts on offer are:\nPresident, Deputy President (Finance &\nServices), Deputy President (Clubs & Societies)\nand Felix Editor & Print Unit Manager.\nSo how do you go about being elected?\nThe first thing to do is to get nominated. You\nneed someone to propose you for the post. This\nmeans that they think you are the right person\nfor the job and you have the right personal and\nprofessional qualities. Twenty people have to\nsecond you to show that other people support\nyou and the views of your proposer.\nThe nomination is recorded on the election\npapers which are displayed opposite the Union\nOffice, 1st floor, Union Building, Beit Quad.\nYou have from when the papers go up, 9am, Monday 14th February to when they come\ndown, 6pm, Friday 25th February to get both\nyour proposer and twenty second ers to sign the\npapers. Remember no 'Mickey Mouse' or ' B. Clinton'; your proposer s and second er have to\nbe fully registered students of Imperial College.\nAfter the papers come down, all proposed\nand fully seconded candidates start their\ncampaigns using posters, flyers, manifestoes,\nspeeches...the candidates must convince you that\nthey are worthy of your vote.\nIn the second week of the campaign, there are\nthe hustings. The hustings are where you get to\nhear the candidates and their proposer s speak\nand, more importantly, where you get to\nquestion them on any issue to do with the\ncampaign. The dates, locations and times are\nadvertised well in advance.\nOn the following Monday and Tuesday, 14th and 15th March, voting takes place across\nCollege, St Mary's and Silwood Park. Voting\nstations record your secret voting slip in ballot\nboxes. Voting closes on the evening of the 15th. All the votes are then counted. Later that night\nthe winners are announced.\nFor anyone thinking of standing, make sure\nyou talk to the current holder of the post to get\nan idea of what the job entails and the responsibilities that go with it. You need also to talk to\nAndy Wensley (President) as he is the returning\nofficer for the elections. He will talk you\nthrough the rules and procedures that control our\nelections. You need to know these as you may\nbe disqualified if you break these rules.\nRemember the dates and get ready to vote.\nHull, Hell and Hall\nIf you are a first year undergraduate, chances are\nyou'll be one of the quarter of all IC students\nliving in a hall of residence. In my opinion the\n'hall experience' is one you grow to love or\nloath, depending to some extent on whether you\nand your hall are compatible.\nI remember, prior to arriving here from the\nprimitive northern reaches of Hull two years\nago, reading in the College accommodation\nliterature that I would be 'guaranteed a top of\nthe range, single room with at least some mod\ncons (bed, door, windows etc.) for about \u00a350 a week.' Allowing for inflation, it makes IC\naccommodation some of the most expensive in\nthe country and indeed in London.\nNow, as the ICU Accommodation Officer, I am concerned with trying to get value for money\nfor the residents. The quality of facilities varies\ntremendously from one hall to another and\nencompasses a great many factors; from the\nstructural health of the building to the number of\nstudents per cooker hob.\nA lot of concerns can't be addressed\novernight. However discussing them now, might\nmean in a couple of years time, (everything\ncosts money!) something can be done. The\naccommodation committee establishes a network of hall contacts, so ICU can keep more\ninformed and liaise more effectively with\nCollege staff.\nEach hall 'elects' a housing representative,\nwho attends accommodation meetings. This\ngives them the opportunity to sort out routine\nhall problems by discussing them with residence\nstaff and gives the chance for two-way\ncommunication. The residence staff encourage\nthe opportunity for our (constructive) comments.\nFor instance as a result: some halls now have\nmore microwaves and Southside laundry is open\nlonger. We can also discover what 'invisible'\naction is been taken on our behalf and some of\nthe logistics behind particular decisions.\nThe committee also provides a source of\nstudent opinion and debate on various issues;\nsuch as the huge notice boards which have so far\nbeen put into 'study bedrooms' in Southside,\nWeeks and Garden. The decision to fit the\nboards was made last year, in an attempt to\nprotect the walls from students in general and\nblu-tac stains in particular. Next year the notice\nboards will be the only space where posters will\nbe permitted. This was debated at length by the\nhall reps, and unearthed a lot of student disquiet.\nEvery Easter, hall residents panic over\nwhether storage space will be available, this is\nlargely because no-one is quite sure of the\nprocedure for finding out. I have been promised\nthat space will be available, providing residents\ngo and see their housekeeper and add their\nnames to the list now. Southside and Linstead\nwill be used for external conference letting, over\nthe vacation but Evelyn Gardens won't. So if\nyou need to stay in London over Easter and only\nhave a34 week let, go to the Accommodation\nOffice, 15 Princes Gardens, again now, and they\nwill try to accommodate you.\nI sit on various College committees discussing future strategies (as yet confidential) for the\nrunning of student residences. Some issues that\nhave recently been resurrected are common\nrooms and the Accommodation Booklet which is\ngiven to all first years. The booklet is currently\nunder review by the College and will hopefully\nincorporate some descriptions of halls by the\nHall Representatives.\nPotential common rooms (in both Clayponds\nand Willis-Jackson/Holbein) have been given a good airing and we are currently awaiting\ndecisions from the College.\nFinally, if you don't know who your Hall\nRep is, find out from a Subwarden or me, and\nthen make sure you go and harass them with\nyour comments and complaints.\nAlternatively, do not hesitate to contact me if\nyou want to make your opinion known about\nany accommodation matters, either through my\npigeonhole in the Union Office, Dave Goddard\nin the Union Office (ext 03502) or in FalmouthKeogh hall in the evening (ext 94 722).\nStudents and\nBenefits\nOverseas students with a restriction on 'recourse\nto public finds' cannot claim the following\nbenefits: Income Support, Family Credit,\nHousing (Rent) Benefit, Homelessness\nAccommodation. If any of the above are\nclaimed by a student, the right to stay in Britain\nwill be jeo pardi sed. Any benefit not included in the above 'public\nfunds' list can be claimed without affecting the\nright to stay. This includes Child Benefit, One\nParent Benefit, Council Tax Benefit,\nUnemployment Benefit, Sickness Benefit,\nDisability Living Allowance. Students can claim\nif eligible, eg. child benefit if they have a child.\nStudents cannot normally claim Council Tax\nBenefit, but currently a non-student partner can\nclaim as it is not a 'public fund'. From 1st April\n1994, Council Tax Benefit will become a 'public fund'. This means partners of students\nwith a restriction on public funds cannot claim\nCouncil Tax Benefit from 1st April 1994 as it\nwill affect the right to remain in Britain.\nStudents may be able to claim urgent case\npayment if funds from abroad are temporarily\ndisrupted. Obtain advice before making a claim.\nDifferent rules apply to home students, EEC\nstudents, refugees and if the partner is settled in\nBritain. If in doubt, advice should be sought.\nFurther advice from the Union Adviser,\nMinever Kavlak, or Citizens Advice Bureau.\nDo You Need Financial Help?\n'Access funds are available for home students.\nApplication forms from the College Fees\nOffice, room 334, Sherfield Building. Forms\nmust be returned by 25th February.\nPeople who do not qualify for access funds\n(eg. overseas students) can apply for a hardship fund. Deadline is 14th February. See\ntutor because you must be nominated for it.\nFurther details can be obtained from Tony\nCullen, room 335, Sherfield Building.\nThe Union Adviser can be phoned on ext 3507\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs and Societies 11\nMathSoc\nOn 22nd November 1993, a new departmental\nsociety sprang into life. The Mathematics\nSociety (Maths Soc) was born, heir to the late\nMOPSoc and promising to promote Maths and\nits applications to the best of its abilities.\nNow, a quarter of a year on, we welcome the\nHead of Department, Prof Adrian Smith, in a pseudo-maths talk entitled 'Statistics, Money\nand Sex - How to make decisions about the\nreally important things in life.' As with all\nMaths Soc lectures, anyone is welcome and the\ntalk, on Thursday 17th February in Huxley room\n340, starts at 1pm. Make sure you don't miss\nthis rare opportunity to see the mystical master\nof Mathematics at work!\nPrevious lectures have included the as-seen-m Felix 'Afterglow of Creation' by Marcus\nChown, 'Colouring Maps' featuring the Four\nColour Map Problem, 'Connections (?) between\nMaths and Chess' and a tutorial on Euclid's Algorithm. More talks are planned featuring\nboth guest 'outside' lecturers and departmental\nstaff displaying their unique talents. All these\nlectures are open to anyone in College and we\nare taking suggestions for speakers.\nBut that's not all. We're also involved in\nactivities ranging from chess to football to darts\nto a quiz and even a newsletter, Epsilon.\nUnfortunately these events are open to just\nMaths Soc members but we're willing to take on\nany teams in College! If you're interested in\nmore details, contact Sai Hong Lee, Maths 3.\nRemember, 'Statistics, Money and Sex',\nThursday 17th February, Huxley room 340,\nl pm. Identity Crisis\nor Personality\nClash?\nIs that Prince Charles, Peter Beardsley or Dame\nEdna? No, hang on it's, now don't tell me, it's Jo Brand, no, Trevor Brooking or is it Simon\nBates. Surely you couldn't get Ronald Reagan\nand Julian Clary in the same room. Well,\nperhaps not in real life but Alistair McGowan\nwill do his best to bring them all together.\nAlistair is one of a new breed of\nimpressionists. He provides many of the voices\nfor Spitting Image, the football fanzine\nprogramme Standing Room Only and the list of\nradio appearances is truly impressive, trust me, I couldn't fit it on this page. Not only can he mix\nit with the best of the impressionists but he is\nalso a very funny stand- up comedian as well.\nHe should be really; since 1989 he has\nworked extensively at all the major London\ncomedy venues including the Comedy Store,\nRed Rose Club and the Chuckle Club. Building\non this success he had two successful shows at\nthe Edinburgh Fringe Festival, firstly with 'Two\nGirls Wot Sing', then with Harry Hill in 'When\nHarry Met Ally' which later became a four part\nseries on Radio 4. Alistair can be caught once a week on the Diana Luke show on GL R previewing the week's comedy in the capital,\nnot a bad idea if you're in the game yourself!\nHe's popping into Da Vinci's Bar at Imperial\nCollege Union along with his voicebox full of\nAlistair McGowan - the man of a million voices\nfriends ready to entertain you. Just think about\nsome of the personalities in his repertoire, there\nis the potential for the intellectual might of The\nWord's Terry Christian pitting wits against\nNewsnight's Jeremy Paxman or Henry Kelly\ncoming face to face with Chris Eubank (now\nthere's a prospect). So, come along, watch and\nlisten; this blok e is going to be big, huge even,\nand this is possibly your last chance to see him\nbefore you won't see any change out of \u00a310 at\nsome teeny London venue with 400,000 other\npeople.\nSilent Bladerunning\nNext Monday's ICSF video projected double bill\nconsists of the New Zealandish The Quiet Earth\n(6pm) and the environmentally sound Silent\nRunning (8pm). Both films are being shown in\nChem Eng LT1 and are free to members of\nICSF, Third World First, EATS and EnviroSoc\n(who will be giving a brief talk before the film\nand giving you the chance to join their societies)\nSilent Running is 'effects man' Douglas\nTrumbull's first attempt at direction. The story\nconcerns three star arks containing the last plant\nlife from the now ravaged Earth. When the crew\nare ordered to jettison the geodesic domes\nholding their previous cargo and return to Earth,\none of them rebels, kills the others and sets off\ninto space with only three robot drones for\ncompany. The film is very moving and Freedom\nLowell is one of the most complex SF cinema\ncharacters yet.\nMore strong character is ation features in The\nQuiet Earth, the story of how a man tries to cope\nwhen he attempts suicide then wakes to find\nhimself alone on an Earth seemingly devoid of\nall other life. The study of this relationship first\nwith his own self and later with two other\nsurvivors of 'the effect' is sharp and often\nuncomfortable. Entry to both films is free to\nICSF members. Membership costs just \u00a33 and\ngets you in free to our full programme of video\ndouble bills, gives the chance to borrow over\n3,000 books, videos and graphic novels from our\nlibrary in the corner of Beit Quad and offers\nreduced entry to our 35mm presentations,\nincluding your first film free.\nOn Tuesday at 7pm in the Concert Hall we're\njust thrilled to present Bladerunner: The\nDirector's Cut in glorious pana vision. Far\nsuperior to the original cinematic release, this\nversion features a darker ending and is more\natmospheric without the embarrassingly Mickey\nSpillane-style voiceover s. The powerful story\nconcerns a special unit police officer, a Bladerunner, called in to hunt down real humans.\nAs the plot unfolds, the Bladerunner begins to\nquestions his own humanity as he tracks the\nsteadily more human replicants until a kind of\nparity is achieved between himself and the\nreplica nt leader after a nail biting cat and mouse\nchase through a wrecked tenement. Brilliant\nperformances, an intense script and Ridley\nScott's stunning visual hand combine to make\nthis a true SF classic.\nEntry is \u00a31.50 to ICSF members (member-ship \u00a33, details above) and \u00a32 to non-members.\nNew Music\nFor Haldane\nAs some of you may have noticed, the shelves\nin the Jazz, Folk and Pop music recordings\nsection of the Haldane Library are looking quite\nbare. Despite the efforts of last year's record\nbuyer, Dave Goddard, who boosted the size of\nthe collection by 70 odd (and not so odd) titles,\nthese are on loan virtually all the time. Acting as\nthis year's buyer I shall expand the collection,\nbuying new titles with the \u00a31,000 Union budget.\nI envisage a large portion of the titles to be\nnew releases from the nine months since the last\nbout of buying in July. In addition, since the\nHaldane sold off its vinyl collection at the end\nof last year, I will attempt to replace some of the\n'classic' titles with CDs. Cassettes will still be\nbought, but only in the ratio of one cassette for\nevery four CDs.\nSuggestions are welcomed - the library is\nrepresentative of the tastes of the entire College.\nSimply fill in a form at the Central Libraries\nIssue Desk and watch out for lists of latest\npurchases to be posted regularly in Felix or on\nthe library notice board.\nSagar Das, Chem Eng 3\nSee Alistair McGowan next Friday evening in Da Vinci's "

    "content": "18 Reviews\nTori Amos\nUnder The Pink\nThis is the story of a little girl who got lost in the\nsky. She liked to sit and watch the stars, in all\ntheir perpetual, frozen grandeur. One night she\nforgot to look away; forgot the teeming,\noverripe, gloriously human world around her\nand was borne up by the music of the spheres to\nbecame a star. And of course, stars take no\nnotice of those who stare up in rapt wonder...\nThe first thing you notice is the sense of\ndistance; Tori no longer needs an audience,\nshe'd carry on making celestial music whether\nwe listened or not. Epics like 'Yes, Anastasia'\ntake your breath away, but give nothing back.\nWe miss the playfulness which rescued 'Little\nEarthquakes' from mordant angst. For all their\nbeauty these songs seem unfinished, an empty\nroom housing a collection of aborted ideas.\nAnd yet...I listened again, in the lees of the\nnight; tasted the melancholy strings of 'Pretty\nGood Year', became enveloped by the numbed\nheartache of 'Past the Mission', the clattering\nmenace of 'Waitress'. For a moment I danced\namongst the stars and understood; then back to\nearth, with a bump. There were too many stars,\nand not enough sky. (7)\nJoe\nPI\nPI u suu u Mark Lanegan\nWhiskeyfor the Holy Ghost\nMark Lanegan is the singer with the Screaming\nTrees, one of the longest lived and most\nunderrated bands on the Seattle label, Sub Pop.\nTheir trademark is a much imitated wall of\nguitar, probably best illustrated on their last\nalbum, 'Sweet Oblivion'. But their secret was\nMark's nicotine stained voice. Telling tales of\nloves lost and sorrow drowned. Alcohol,\ncigarettes and other drugs have played a large\npart in his life, alternately threatening his career\nand inspiring it.\nHis first solo album, 'The Winding Sheet',\ntook the press by surprise. The sparseness of the\nmusic allowed his vocals to lead rather than\ncompete with the guitars. 'Whiskey' continues\nin this vein while being more instrumental.\nThere is an impressive list of of guests\nplaying in the background. Kurt Cobain\nstrummed on the first album. This time\ndrumming duties are shared by Tad's Tad\nDoyle, Mudhoney's Dan Peters and Dinosaur\nJr'sJ Mascis.\nThe style of the songs veers from Nick Cave\nto Neil Young and back again. The standout\ntrack is 'Carnival', where Mark ponders the\nsimilarity between his life on the road and the\nfreak shows that used to visit his childhood town.\nAs for the rest, the song titles say it all -'Kingdom of Rain', 'Dead on You', 'Beggars\nBlues' and so on - all tales of ghosts from the\npast, regret and guilt. Like Nick Cave, he can\nmake it seem so rivetting and you find yourself\nabsorbed in his tales of woe. If you can stomach\nit then this is the record for you. (9)\nRidley Dash\nMagnapop\nHot Boxing\nThe blurb that came with this album calls it\n'truly fire some', which isn't altogether true. It\nstarts off with a song called 'Slowly, Slowly',\nalso their current single. The title describes it\nrather well which doesn't bode well for the rest\nof the album. However, once you get to the third\ntrack, 'Lay It Down', the producer Bob Mould\ncomes into effect (although it sounds more like\nthe Breeders than Hiisker Dii).\nThings start to liven up and this continues for\nmost of the album, with 'Piece Of Cake', 'Free\nMud' and 'Idiot Song' being the best.\nThere are exceptions, though, one of the\nmost obvious being the seventh track, 'Leo',\nwhich starts off with the producer playing with\nthe level and speed of the recording. It's pretentious, stupid and the worst on the album.\nAll in all, if you can cope with the songs\nsounding pretty similar, it is a fairly good first\nalbum. If you can't, wait for 'Lay It Down' on\nsingle, 'cos it's smart! (5)\nTimsi\nThere's a fallow ness in the air, even the 12\"s come packaged in clinical white sleeves, as if\nthey are afraid to own themselves. I'm still\nrecovering from a night ful of Madder Rose, a band who have touched me like a rainy dusk at\nthe edge of the world. And yet still I have to lay\nbefore you all the fruits from the loins of what is\nsometimes laughingly referred to as 'the Biz'.\nI 've always hated 'Take the Weather With\nYou' but there again I'm not reviewing\nCrowded House's new single, 'Locked Out',\nthat pleasure goes to Vik. \"These Antipodeans\nspecialise in well-crafted, honest pop songs.\n'Locked Out' is another lively example, but\nthrows in some '80s indie guitar to create an\nunorthodox Smiths-meets-Squeeze sound.\"\nSleeper, on the other hand, are one of the\ndubious recipients of the New Wave of the New\nWave millstone. A grinning Mr Happy takes to\nthe stage and in his best voice projects on their\n'Swallow' EP...\"Despite the fact that the Pixies\nare sadly missed, there is no need for such a blatant rip-off. I even had to check the sleeve to\nmake sure I hadn't put 'Doolittle' on.\"\nAnd above, we see Sleeper, fresh faced,\npouting and incarcerated in leather. The future's so bright...\nIf only the packaging on Rose Chronicle's amazonian ly named 'Dead And Gone To\nHeaven (awaiting eternity)' were a portent of\nwhat lay inside. Swiftly did Owain grasp the\nlovely object that arrived one day. Now he can\nonly scrawl: \"Can you chart the course of the\nsoul with the voice of the beautiful but earthy\nAll about Eve? Only the last track, nine minutes\nof thunderstorms, speeding cars and aboriginal\npipes, lends grav it as to the question. Still,\npromising.\"\nCamille is a knocking on my door, ready to\nrattle off a hit or two, well, maybe. With a skip\nand a hop enter the Loop Gurus clutching a copy of 'Sus-san-tics'. \"They cherish dreams of\na musical Utopia. Revolving around the antics of\navant-garde singer Sussan Derhim, they bring\ntogether sounds from all over the globe.\"\nHo hum m.I depart leaving the last two lines\nfor that most warm hearted bird, Mr Penguin on\na certain Joe Roberts: \"Promising in its\nsoulfulness but ends up a bit weak. Look out for\nthe next one.\" I can only bow gently, navel\nglaze and remain, happy to be, Tintin.\n...you best pray that I bleed real soon, how's that one for you...\n\n"

Eleven years old\nand horrified. The idea of one of those skinny\ncreatures thinking of me whilst listening to\nTainted Love, tongue to the envelope, licking\nit...I destroyed the card in a wave of disgust. My\nsiblings pieced back together the goo ble de gook.( \"Shmugbug please be my be drug.\") They were\nlooking for something more psychotic - my\nbrother had been sent Cindy doll parts all week;\nhis name scored into the plastic with a Stanley\nknife. So the sib s, unimpressed, sauntered back\ninside to watch Taxi Driver, Me, I forgot about it\nuntil I reached fourteen and suddenly wanted to\nknow which of those pouting sexpots had lusted\nfor me. Unfortunately, they were now too busy\nbeing driven around in Ford Capris by their\nsixth form boyfriends. I cursed my late\ndevelopment and my early good taste.\nHonestly, males should be held back from\nschool for five years. When the female of the\nspecies is holding slumber parties, playing\nTwister and wondering just why she likes the\nshower so much, the male is in the toilets\nchallenging his mighty mates to 'hit the ceiling'.\nEvery year I'd fall for someone, end up thinking\nthe excellent pre-printed rhyme quite sufficient\nand sign it 'from Owain'. Why did I never learn?\nAs regularly, the girls would point, not giggling\nlike in a movie but smirking. \"HimT, they'd say, with a quizzical mix of shock, dismissal and\nrepugnance. After several years of these annual\npublic humiliations I finally\ncaught on. Women don't write\ncards for men, they write them\nfor each other.\nThink about it! It's one of\nthose bonding things. Going\ndown to Athena together,\npicking your cards, writing your\ncr ingy lines together and then\nlaughing at the recipient\ntogether. And the codes! Show\nme a man who understands\n'SWLAK', ' GY KO Q Y M CH' or\nTW AN2 FUKU' and I'll show\nyou a cross-dresser.\nI 've just been informed by a passing hackett e that I'm bitter, twisted and that the acronym is\n'SWALK'. Oh, and Valentine's Day is all about\nlove - yeah, like Silence of the Lambs is all\nabout cooking. \"Go out and ask people then.\"\nHold still, trembling heart! There hasn't been\nsuch a forgone conclusion since General\n'Geographically Challenged' Custer said to\nlieutenant; \"Indians? Indians? Pull yourself\ntogether man, this is California not Calcutta.\"\nI set out in search of Cupid's February Fools.\nI 'll ask them about the hearts and roses stuff; if\nany of them come over all dreamy Diana will\nsnap them for posterity...and prosperity too, in\nthe subsequent blackmail for the negatives.\nFirst up, a strapping young man is sunning\nhimself in the JCR. I rush over and mumble\nsomething about Valentines and the trooper\nunderstands me. \"Nah, it's all too commercial\nnow,\" Matt says, although I wonder if he's biased when I discover he works in the\nbookshop. He's undecided about whether he'll\ndo anything with his girlfriend on Valentine's Day, but I wouldn't hold your breath; he was\n\"exhausted after being with her\nlast night.\" My kind of man.\nScore one to my side.\nOur next victim is sitting\nnervously beside a pillar. He\nlooks as scared as I am. Why?\nIt's the prospect of going up to\nan Imperial Man and potential\nrugby player and asking him\nsweetly if he still believes in\nlove and romance. (\"Yeah, kiss\nthis!\" Cue flying fist and\nspiralling reporter. I make a mental note not to talk to anyone\nin a stripe y shirt and shorts.) I ask Mr Nervous about the day. He looks about\nand as he reads his paper says conspirator ly: \"Yeah, it means something. It's a chance to tell\nsomeone how you feel about them.\" Worse, he\ncalls it \"an excuse\", implying that we'd send\neach other pink paper with 's nook ie bear'\nwritten on it every day if only we could\novercome our existential solitude.\nHe admits that he has a girlfriend and will be\ntaking her out on the fourteenth. The man is too\nsoppy for words, I have to\nphotograph this. \"No!\" says Mr\nNervous, holding up his hands.\n\"No photo, no names.\" He then\nquestions who to ask about\nputting mascot ry articles in\nFELiX. That's the reason for his\nreticence, he says. As quickly as\nyou can say \"fasten your seat\nbelt please Mr Rushdie, we shall\nshortly be landing in Iran,\" he's gone. All I can say is if you think\nhe's your man,\nyour best bet is\nto carry an eight\nfoot by three foot Valentine's card with you to lectures.\nNext up is Miss X, a physics\nstudent. \"Valentine's Day is cute\nif you're in love. But if you're\nnot, it really means nothing\". I ask her if it could actually be\ndangerous - ostr aci sing the\nlonesome and single population,\nleaving them with nothing to do\nbut eat chocolate and watch\nBaywatch, nothing to listen to\nbut The Red House Painters, no hope of a hand\nto clutch in the godless February evenings, when\nthe neon burns so bright and warm and you're so\nalone, unwanted, walking the streets and\nanyway, she says \"no\" though judging from the\nlook of her she's ne'er worn down the leather\nKevin, The Sexual Chemist\nAnna sells tea and hearts\ntreading Kings Road at 2am. So it's not\ndangerous? \"Only if you're very insecure.\" Me?\nHer friend Bill tips the balance towards the\nlove camp when he claims Valentine's cards are\na good idea and that he once worked out who\nsent him a card by the handwriting. Hmmm...try\nusing a typewriter next time Bill.\nAndy, from Mech Eng, tells\nme that he will be sending a card. He was pressured into it by\nhis flat mates( her mates).\nThere's \"no romance involved at\nall\" although he hurriedly adds\nthat his romance \"lies\nelsewhere\". Nice recovery.\nAm I the only decent cynic\nhere? No way says Sally, who\nstudies Biology. \"I don't think\npeople believe in it. I know I 'll\nget one but I 've already told him\nI won't be sending him one.\" Eat\nyour cake and get someone to bake you another.\nMomentum is def in at ly swinging my way. I notice a sturdy gent with a worldly wise glint in\nhis eye. He proves a noisy one.\n\"Valentine's Day? It's a chance for desperate\nmen to find desperate women - with the\npossibility of a shag at the end of it!\" he rattles\nout. Ouch. He carries on \"I mean it's a joke! For\none day in the year a man will get romantic -what about the other 364?\"\nCome on Kevin, haven't you ever wined and\ndined, sent flowers? \"Flowers! That's it! It's all\npart of the world wide Interflora conspiracy!\"\nHis friend shakes her head. \"Yeah, lets get\n'the woman's perspective' now,\" says Kevin,\ncottoning on to the corny language.

    "content": "20 Feature\nA Terrible Beauty is Born\nThe world is full of\nbeautiful things and\nriddled with terrible\nthings and the Phoenix\nis a thing of terrible\nbeauty. Once a year our\nown Phoenix rises from\nthe white hot flames of\ntest tubes, superstring s and the intertwined\nstrands of deoxyribonucleic acid which\nmake up our Imperial\nliving. Together we can\nfly, laugh, love, dance\nand live again...\n...I refer to the annual art magazine of Imperial\nCollege of Science, Technology and Medicine.\nWith CP. Snow's ghost still weeping quietly\ninto his ale, the time has come for scientists,\nengineers and doctors to stand up tall and think\nbig. For Phoenix is an opportunity for us all to\nadvance over the divide of Science and Art.\nSo to business. We've got work to do. This\nyear's Phoenix will be organised under five\nchapter headings which will ostensibly follow\nthe life of a Phoenix. Starting with birth and\ngrowth, then maturity, onto the decline of years\nand pen ultimately to death. Yet the pedigree of\nthe Phoenix is that it is reborn from the flames of\nits death to new life. And so we finish with the\nlast chapter heading, rebirth. The idea is that\ncontributors can work around this skeleton plan\nand together we can build a perfect, well\nrounded beast that will be the envy of the world.\nIn previous years the predominance of work\nhas been poetry and short pieces of prose but the\nstage is open for your choice. Photographs,\ndrawings, graphics, play scripts, whatever, will\nbe welcome. We especially need artists to design\nfrontispieces, covers and chapter headings. We\ndon't really want long stories, though, but come\nand talk to us if you are feeling Tolstoic.\nThe twin-headed editorship this year consists\nof Owain Bennallack and Jon Jordan. Please\ncome over to the Felix Office and rattle our\ncages, discuss schemes and plan marvellous\nma a zines. We are usually resident during\nlunchtimes, so don't delay. There is also a pigeonhole in Felix for you to drop things into\nand Owain can be reached on email:\noj b@ ic.doc.uk. The deadline for work will be\nthe end of this term and the proposed publication date will be early in the summer.\nWe shall see you soon.\nValentines Cards from ICU Bookstore are...\nli y PYI II arty cards ALL lWr WT available too.\nDon't forget our extensive range of\ncute soft toys! i CV IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nBOOKSTORE\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews 15\nAccustomed to\nHer Face\nHilarious, raucous, crude and highly enjoyable.\nThe play is set in Scotland and centres around\nthe visit of an American student, Erin, to the\nhouse of two down-and-out Scottish lasses,\nBasher and Maxy. Welcome, she is not. As she\ntries to fit in, you don't know who to feel sorry\nfor but end up laughing at all of them.\nIt soon transpires that Erin is a lesbian and\nthe rest of the play concerns her seduction of\nthe, hereto, very straight, Basher and Maxy's feelings of loss of her best friend.\nThe romance that follows is sweet and funny,\nuntil Erin's holiday ends. Heart breaking and\ncruel, this play, with all its humour, has such a sad ending. A play that proves that all a woman\nreally needs is a good shag to sort her out. We\nhighly recommend it.\nRach and Jane\nDrill Hall, 16 Chenies St, WC1. 071 637 8270.\nTube: Goodge St. Until 19th February.\nli fi I111S1\nSoft Vengeance\nGraeae (Grey-Eye), Britain's most distinguished\ntheatre company of disabled people, sets their\nlatest play in Maputo, Mozambique. On 7th April 1988, Albie Sachs, exiled South African\nCivil Rights lawyer and prominent member of\nthe African National Congress (ANC) opened\nhis car door to begin a trip to the beach for a leisurely jog. A massive explosion destroyed\nSachs's right arm, embedding shrapnel in his\nbody and causing him to lose the sight in one\neye. That's how his new battle starts, a fight to\noverhaul his body and mind.\nAs Sachs heals physically, he struggles\nmentally to adjust to his injuries and disabilities\nand renews his political battle. His altered ego\nquestions his beliefs and ideas, making his fight\neven more difficult. Necessity to learn to do\nthings from scratch makes him rephrase\nDescartes' famous statement to 'Joke, therefore\nI am', or even 'Shit, therefore I am'. At the end\nit was declaration of faith in the power of the\nspirit that won and which made him, seven\nmonths after the bomb went off, reach the beach\nand continues his interrupted jog.\nGraeae brings special intelligence, authenticity and power to the story and makes Soft\nVengeance an unusual play worth seeing.\nElena\nBattersea Arts Centre, 176 Lavender Hill,\nSW11. 071 223 2223. Train: Clapham junction\nBR. Cones \u00a35. Until 13th February.\nGormenghast\nImagine a castle vast as mountains, its ancient\ntowers reaching high above the clouds, its\ncancerous roots buried deep in the wounds of the\nworld. Within, a tangled knot of rough-hewn\ncorridors carry the kingdom's blood to every\npart of the ruined castle, from the Earl of\nGroan's library to Swelter's hellish kitchen. The\nblood of the kingdom is bittersweet and steeped\nin webs of ritual. It is a world to itself and the\nstench of decay hangs heavy in the air.\nGormenghast.\nThe world of Gormenghast is the creation of\nMervyn Peake, whose classic trilogy of novels\ntells the story of Titus, the 77th Earl of Groan\nand reluctant Master of Gormenghast (although\nhe isn't actually born until the end of the first\nbook). In bringing Peake's sprawling fantasy to\nthe stage director David Glass and writer John\nConstable have taken on a mammoth task - and\nsucceeded brilliantly.\nThis acclaimed adaptation takes the first two\nparts of the trilogy and distills the essence of\nPeake's rich and evocative style into two hours\nof enthralling physical theatre. Every moment\nprovides a new delight for the audience:\nchallenging and inventive stage effects,\nimpressive performances from a strong cast and\nstunning music which fits the action perfectly.\nGlass makes intelligent use of simple props\nand creative stage design to transport us into a strange and fascinating world, where madness\nand death lurk in the shadows. The cast is more\nthan equal to his vision, combining physical\nvirtuosity with a sure grasp of character. Ewen\nBremner takes over the role of Titus, doing a solid job of prot raying the reluctant heir.\nIn short: Fiery Fast and Dynamic. New York's pace and aggression is captured using loud\nmusic, frequent set changes and scenes acted in\ntandem. I found this confusing at the start but\nsoon got caught up in the excitement.\nKushner's play is about Mormons, Ray Cohn\nand AIDS. Cohn is the ruthless right wing\nextremist who worked for the McCarthy witch\nhunt to root out communism in America. For\nCohn to be successful in his 'work' it is\nimperative that he hides his homosexuality.\nBitter yet ruthless his character is to be pitied.\n(In fact, his sexual orientation prevented him\nrunning for the Senate.)\nAIDS touches almost all the characters. One\nexception is Harper, a junky housewife who\nBarquentine, Master of Ritual and undisputed\nGurning Champion of Gormenghast\nThe Lyric is perhaps not the best venue for a play of this type, since the theatre gives an\nimpression of distance between the stage and the\naudience. Otherwise, Gormenghast is an\nimmensely enjoyable play - even if you haven't read the books. Go see it!\nJoe\nLyric Hammersmith, King Street W6. 081 741\n2311. Tube: Hammersmith.

Certain scenes, really bring home\nthe reality of this disease, the difficulties facing\nhomosexuals, their families and their relation-ships. The frailty of human relationships and the\npain involved when we fail those we love are\nwell illustrated.\nAll this is heavy stuff, packed with punches\nbut the play's wit and humour makes it easy to\ntake it all on board. The end is dramatic.\nI was fascinated and look forward to seeing\nthe second part of this epic, Perestroika.\nAilish\nCottesloe Theatre of the Royal National Theatre,\nSouthbank, SE1. 071 633 0880.

    "content": "14 Reviews\nLush Tunes, Bland Interiors\nAfter the exposed nipples of the Barbican's Bill\nBrandt/Alphonse Mucha exhibition posters, it\nmust have come as something of a surprise to\nthe ENO marketing department to learn that\ntheir Rosenkavalier poster had fallen victim to\nLondon Transport's blue pencil. No doubt the\nlatest London Underground Charter pledges to\nprotect its passengers - or rather, customers -from the sleaze and depravity of the un-basic\nstreet-level world. To see the original, be nipple d version of the poster, you'll have to go to the\nColiseum in St Martin's Lane.\nHowever, after careful scrutiny of Jonathan\nMiller's actual production, your critic is able to\nreport that this is one ENO staging to which\neven the most prudish of London Transport\nofficials could safely take his granny. Act I can\nbe summed up in one word: bland. (Not an\nadjective often applied to the products of this\nhouse.) The set is straight from the National\nTrust School of Interior Design, the decor\ndominated by what looks like the hybrid\noffspring of a Doric column and a dustbin. Act\nII, with its elegant, windowed corridor, looked\nmuch better. But after Act III, in which the plot\nallows the designer's imagination freer reign,\none was left wondering what Stefanos Lazaridis\nmight have done, had he not been lured away to\ndesign Duran Duran's current tour.\nWhat really matter of course are Strauss's wonderfully lush and tuneful music and the\ncharacters of Hofmannsthal's giddy plot, and\nhere too there are pros and cons. John\nTomlinson relishes the part of the oleaginous\nOchs, the bawdy Baron who must be thwarted\nbefore his intended bride, the young heiress\nSophie, can find true love with the eponymous\nCount Octavian. Tomlinson's voice is stretched\nby the lowest notes of the Baron's music and he\nsometimes adopts a par lando style, delivery in\nrapid passages, but the lyrical music is\ngracefully delivered. And from Act II onwards,\nhis portrayal is genuinely funny: a bandy-legged,\namiable (but thick) Don Giovanni. The silvery-voiced Rosemary Joshua is very attractive as\nSophie, particularly in the opening love-duet of\nAct II - surely one of the most ravishing pieces\nof music ever written. Elsewhere she tends to\nbecome submerged and indeed muddled and\nindistinct ensemble singing was a problem\nthroughout the evening. Minor roles too were on\nthe whole under projected. It certainly wasn't all the fault of the\norchestra under Yakov Kreizberg. It's no bad\nthing, in this sometimes overpowering ly rich\nmusic, to opt for a lean sound and the consistently beautiful, flowing phrases were a highlight of the performance. And there was\nThe oleaginous Baron Ochs (John Tomlinson)\nand Annina (Claire Powell).\nmuch character ful wind-playing, such as the\nvulgar squawks that accompanied the entrance\nof Octavian disguised as e eg orb lime y servant-girl Mariandel.\nPatrick Wood\nIn rep at the Coliseum, St Martin's Lane WC2N.\n(071) 836 3161.

    "content": "Reviews 17\nThe Three\nMusketeers\nStarring: Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland\nDirector: Stephen Herek\nNice concept - shame about the movie! That\nreally sums up the latest would-be blockbuster\nfrom the Walt Disney stable - a fairly straight\nadaptation of the classic novel by Alexandre\nDumas. With such a basis you'd think it is\ndifficult to go far wrong, but director Stephen\nHerek handles the film with a sloppy touch. Not\ntoo surprising considering his other films\ninclude Critters and ...Mom, the Babysitter's Dead.\nIf there is a major fault, it is that the film\nreally tries too hard to be another Robin Hood:\nPrince of Thieves. It gets blas e to the extent that\npurely profit expectant sequels do. In fact you\ncan almost imagine producer Joe Roth saying to\nhis team: \"Well it's bound to be great anyway,\nso we'll take it easy on the filming, OK.\"\nThe main actors aren't as strong as you'd hope, with Kiefer Sutherland's Athos being too\nmoody and Charlie Sheen's Aramus not heroic\nenough. The young hero, D 'Artagnan played by\nChris (Scent of a Woman) O 'Donnell is weak\nand hardly worth a mention.\nIf anyone stands out at all it's Oliver Piatt as\nthe fat Porthos, who's been in the background of\nloads of good films for far too long and is now\ncoming to the fore. He gets all the good one-liners and classic scenes. Ironically, though, his\ncharacter comes across closer to that of the\nbook's suave Aramus than the lumbering\nPorthos, which does beg the question, if the\nstory and character is at ions are as good as they\nIn The Name Of The Father\nStarring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Emma Thompson\nDirector: Jim Sheriden\nAs the lights went down, I relished the panning I was going to give In The Name Of The Father.\nDaniel Day-Lewis, public school educated, RSC\ntrained and under the sad delusion that he's Irish, couldn't possibly do justice to the\nGuildford Four story. Particularly when his\npartner in pretension was Emma Thompson, the\nmost detested luv vie of her generation. An ultra-pretentious score by pop poseur Bono seemed to\nconfirm my worst fears. But such is the power of\nthe story and the supporting acting that The\nName Of The Father overcomes these terrible\nobstacles and succeeds as a genuinely moving\nfilm.\nIn 1974, the Guildford Four were beaten into\nconfessing to the horrific pub bombings in\nwhich five people died and 75 were seriously\ninjured. Under pressure to find the bombers, the\npolice arrest a young immigrant from Belfast,\nGerry Conlon, and his friends Paul Hill, Paddy\nArmstrong and Carol Richardson. They also\narrest the whole of Conlon's family in England,\nthe McGuires, on conspiracy to murder charges,\nas well as Gerry's father Guiseppe. They are all\nconvicted, despite the tenuous evidence, and\nsentenced to life. The rest of the film focuses on\nGerry and his father's struggles in prison. At\nfirst they face hostility from the other prisoners,\nbut through constantly proclaiming their\ninnocence they gain their fellow inmates'\nrespect. Meanwhile, a young lawyer called\nGareth Peirce (Thompson) starts to expose the\ninconsistencies in the prosecutor's case.\nIn The Name Of The Father succeeds both as\na critique of mob justice and a touching portrait\nof a sometimes difficult father-son relationship.\nIt avoids the sloppiness and over-simplification\none expects in a movie so obviously pitched at\nan American market. Day-Lewis and Thompson\nmanage to control their innate s mar mines s, but\nthe film belongs to Pete Postlethwaite, whose\nquiet, understated portrayal of Guiseppe Conlon\nblows the posturing 'method' of the stars out of\nthe water. Special mention also for Britta Smith\nas Annie Macguire, whose quiet dignity in the\nface of such odds is one of the film's most\nmoving aspects.\nAlthough a 'feel-good' movie at heart, there\nare enough hard lessons and even harder\ndisappointments to make even the most cynical\nthink twice before condemning anyone without\nlooking at the evidence. For this alone In The\nName Of The Father deserves to be seen.\nTony\nOn general release today\nare in the original novel, why change them?\nJoe Roth said: \"We struggled to finally do it\nright on screen\" and I couldn't agree with him\nmore, though I don't think he meant it quite the\nway I took it. There really isn't enough humour\nand not enough suspense to make up for it. The\naction scenes are mild at best and yes, you've\nguessed it, the funniest bits are all in the trailer.\nCome back Dogtanian, all is forgiven.\nBonnie (& Clyde)\nOn general release today\nWin The Prize\nof Your\nDreams!\n...provided your nights are filled with a haunting desire to own the soundtrack for\nThe Three Musketeers, that is. The good\npeople at A&M records have given us a copy of this small but perfectly formed\nmusical extravaganza, and it is our duty -nay, our pleasure - to run a competition so\nyou can win it. The soundtrack features the\nrecent 'hit single' by those purveyors of\nfine musical taste, Messrs Sting, Bryan\nAdams, and Rod Stewart (but don't let that\nput you off).\nIn order to win this highly desirable\nCD, simply cast your eyes up the page to\nthe Three Musketeers review and ponder\nthe photo contained therein. The lack of\ncaption is not a sad reflection of the\ndeclining standards of the Felix Cinema Ed,\nbut instead provides you with the chance to\nflex your creative muscle, and win the\nsoundtrack. Scribble down a caption for\nthe photo (no more than fifteen words,\nplease) along with your name and dept and\nget it to the Felix Office by next Friday.\nThe most original and witty caption wins,\nthe final decision being left in the\neminently capable hands of the Editor. No\nFelix-type people need apply (so there!).\nNext Week: Reviews of Schindler's List and A Bronx Tale\n\n"

    "content": "Feature 19\nOff the Blocks for Tanzania\nWhen David Knight sets out amongst the hardy runners in this year's Londo\nMarathon he'll be thinking of more than his own health and a cold bath.\nI was born in Nsam nearby a missionary hospital\nin Kampala, the capital of Uganda. When I tell\npeople this, it is often met with some interest\nbecause many people who are born overseas\nhave had interesting childhoods. However, my\nfather's work caused us to leave\nUganda in 1969 when I was just three\nmonths old, so these names don't mean\nmuch to me. My parents met and\nmarried while they were both working\nthere so our house is full of images and\ncarvings from East Africa and these jt Bk have always reminded me that I have <$8lS9 some latent desire to return to that part\nof the world. 1 cannot justify saying\nthat I am returning to my roots, but tii is phrase does partially explain why !\nneed to go back.\nI have never liked the idea ol\ntravelling as a tourist on safari and so\nover the years I have been on the\nlookout for a more solid reason to go '\nto East Africa. While I was studying :\nfor my MSc at Imperial College I found one, hidden in a crack in the\npaving-stone jigsaw of\nadvertisements in the Careers I Guardian. One phone call, and\nselection weekend later, 1 found myself\ndue to leave for Tanzania in May 1994, L to work for the charity Health Projects\nAbroad (HPA).\nThe United Republic of Tanzania W was formed a few years after independence was\ngained in 1961, before which time it was a British protectorate. The ever-popular president\nwas Dr Julius Nyerera, who held power until his\nretirement in 1985. Previously he had studied at\nEdinburgh and was in fact Tanzania's first\nuniversity graduate. He led a programme of\nstate-sponsored socialism, which had the support\nof many western academics, and produced great\nimprovements in the health and education\nsystems in the poorer parts of his country.\nDespite the artificial borders created by\nEuropeans in the 19th century (just look at all\nthose straight lines on the map), he managed to\nengender a cohesive national identity. This\nsubdued the inter-tribal rivalry which has\ndestroyed many other African countries and is a remarkable achievement. Debt crises and the\nremedial IMF Structural Adjustment\nProgrammes (SAPs) have caused much\neconomic turmoil in the last decade, and the\nhealth system has certainly suffered. Many\npeople view these SAPs as a form of\nreconciliation. By our standards health care is\npoorly funded. A general practice of\n12,000 people has, in this country, a budget of \u00a32million. This is same budget\nthat the whole of the Tabora region of\ncentral Tanzania has with a population of\n2 million.\nThe charity HPA works closely with\nrural communities to provide facilities for\nprimary health case. Rather than being\ndirected from outside, the projects are\ninitiated by the local people and HPA then provides the resources to realise their\nplans. I will be working with about\ntwenty other volunteers in the Tabora\nregion of central Tanzania, helping to\nbuild various projects. The work will be\nsupervised by engineers from Britain and\nTanzania and also the local craftsmen.\nOne reason for us travelling out is to\nprovide labour because the local people\ncannot work full time on the projects.\nAnother is that it is a gesture of goodwill\nto the community. The work will also\nprovide a unique opportunity to learn\nabout African life at grass roots level.\nEach volunteer has to contribute \u00a32,450\nto the project costs and to help me reach\nmy target I have organised a competition\nbased on the London Marathon, which I will run\nin April. I would also be very grateful for any\nstraight donations.\nOne returned volunteer explained to me that\nwhile he was there he learnt to walk slowly. I hope that I will know what he meant when I return.\nTick-a Place' Marathon Competition\nWin \u00a3100 worth of vouchers with a clean conscience...\nIn cooperation with Health Projects Abroad, David Knight is giving you the opportunity to win a whole handful\nof vouchers for various goodies! The task? As mentioned above he will be running in this years London Marathon.\nThe competition is to guess his finishing position! Easy? Well there could be up to 30,000 runners so there is plenty of choice. The nearest guess\nwill receive \u00a3100 worth of vouchers for various high street shops. To enter each guess must be accompanied by a \u00a31 donation which will go to the\ncharity Health Projects Abroad. So you can't lose!!! (Of course larger donations will be gratefully received).\np Your Name\nYour Address\nHand your completed form into the Union Office together with a minimum of \u00a31\ndonation or send the form and a cheque (made payable to Health Projects Abroad)\nto the address given on the right.\nAll entries must be received by April 11th. The winner will be contacted on April 21st. In the event of a tie, a draw will determine the winner.\nDavid Knight\nc/o Health Projects Abroad\nHMS President (1918)\nVictoria Embankment\nLondon EC4Y 0HJ iJ "

A man was later\narrested in Hackney in connection\nwith the theft. Two weeks later a hi-fi unit was stolen from the room\nof another student.\nCollege Security believe that the\nthieves gained access to the Hall by\nfollowing students as they entered\nthe building using their magnetic\nkeys.\nFollowing these incidents,\nSouthwell Hall's Warden, Ken Young, has called for students to be\nmore vigilant in checking the\ncredentials of visitors.\nIn another incident, a female\nstudent was woken up at night by\nthe sound of someone trying her\ndoor. When she investigated, she\nfound a man outside who claimed to\nbe looking for a friend who lived\nthere. He left the building shortly\nafterwards.\nThough thieves have only struck\ntwice, it is thought that they are\nchoosing halls of residence because\nthey regard them as an easy target.\nTerm Time Jobs Affect Courses\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nTaking on part-time work could\nseriously affect your degree,\naccording to officials. Vice Chancellors are launching a nationwide\nsurvey to uncover the extent of\nstudent poverty and the numbers\nworking part-time during term.\nWith the basic student grant\ncurrently remaining frozen at the\n1990 levels students are being\nforced to take on Saturday and\nevening jobs to pay rent and living\nexpenses.\nTed Neild, spokesman for the\nCommittee of Vice Chancellors and\nPrincipals commented: \"It cannot\nbe beneficial for students to work\npart-time when they should be\nstudying. They should not have to\ndo that.\"\nA number of Oxbridge colleges\nhave already recognised the problem as serious and banned students\nfrom taking on part-time work\nduring term-time. Some are even\nsending out letters to parents\nrequesting that students do not\nundertake employment during the\nChristmas and Easter vacations.\nA speech made by Liberal\nDemocrat peer Conrad Russell in\nthe House of Lords last week\nhighlighted students' plight. Lord\nRussell, Professor of History at\nKing's College, London, said that\nthe inadequacy of Government\nsupport for students meant there\nhad been a rush into paid employ-ment. He also commented that it\nwas doing \"a great deal of harm\" to\nthe quality of higher education.\n\u2022 FRESH HAIR SALON* the best student offer in london!

This team is\nbeing set up to take part in the first ever\nULU/Oxbridge Challenge at Datchett.\nThe next trip for the club will be a week long\ntrip to Penzance over the Easter holidays, from\n30th March to 6th April.\nSoon after returning from that trip, we will\nbe going to Clacton to take part in the second\nStudent National Windsurfing Championships\nfrom 29th April to 2nd May, the Bank Holiday\nweekend. This event is again being sponsored\nby Bic Sport UK, who are providing a selection\nof their new kit to try out.\nIf you would like any information about\nthese trips, or any details about the club, please\ncome along to our next meeting on Tuesday at\n1.00pm in Southside Upper Lounge and we will\nbe happy to help you out.\nBruno Interviewed on STOIC\nFrank Bruno was interviewed last weekend by\nthe Student Television of Imperial College at his\ntraining camp in Leicester. Frank gives his\nviews on every thing from pantomime to sex.\nThis will be the first programme in a series\ncalled \"Simon Says\" based around the workings\nof a television studio with a guest star in each\nprogramme. A parallel series of interviews is\nalso being run on a more serious note by Carlo\nMassarella. The first in the series was filmed last\nweek with \"Blockbusters\" star, Bob Holness. A season of films is also about to start on STOIC.\nThis is a collection of films made by London\nstudents with a wide variety of themes including\ngangster and horror.\nSTOIC is about to go back on air to the\ncollege halls of residence after rebuilding the\nstudio. If you cannot wait then just watch in Da\nVinci's bar during the day or evening. If there is\na particular programme you want to watch then\nplease ring on (0)3518 or visit the studio on the\ntop floor of the Union Building.\nOn Their Way To Motspur?!\nIC l sts4 Goldsmiths 0\nHaving already beaten two of the top three\nteams in the last couple of weeks, IC were full\nof confidence as they faced the remaining top\nteam, Goldsmiths. They then proceeded to\nexpose Goldies inadequacy and give them a lesson in football unseen since Tottenham 1981.\nThe defence was a picture of stability and keeper\nMark Nally's most difficult moment was dealing\nwith a dangerous Rob Williams back pass.\nWithin minutes, good work down the right\nled to the ball ending up at the feet of American\nIan Palmer. The debut-boy walloped it past the\nGoldsmiths' goalkeeper. Soon after kickoff, IC\nwere awarded a free kick, which Richie Dixon\ntook. He scuffed his shot and the ball ballooned\nonto the head of the left back/centre forward\nBen Willis making the score 2-0. Ian Palmer\nscored a scrappy goal, but it was not until the\nsecond half, that IC scored what has to be\nconsidered the goal of the season. The ball was\nswept around the defence, until Dixon played a peach of a ball to Tellis Botzios, who flicked it\ninto the path of the Owambala, who headed into\nthe top corner with great aplomb.\nAlex de Stefano, in his winger-role, took the\npiss out of several defenders, then went back\nand did it again and again. The final whistle\nsaved Goldsmiths' agony and IC were honourable in victory. A spokesman for the team said:\n\"It was a game of two halves, both dominated by\nIC and we're over the moon, John.\"\nIC next face Kings in the semi-final of the\ncup and having annihilated them once in the\nleague are confident of reaching the finals.

    "content": "Feature 1\nValentine Cards: Principles and Practice\nMichael Ingram, the noted naturalist, talks about the birds and the bees.\nPreface\nFate is taking the piss; it is its nature to do so.\nI had thought that I'd write a nice\nintroduction about who the real Saint Valentine\nactually was. Maybe even get something funny\nout of it. So off I went to the library to hit the\nhistory books. Unfortunately, the history books I found seemed to have been written by David\nLynch. Basically, what they said was this:\nThere were in fact two St. Valentines. No one\nreally knows who either of them were. Neither\ndoes anyone know why they were made saints,\nor why they were immortalised as a date in our\ncalendar. The duo were so mysterious that they\nprobably didn't tell anyone their names when\nthey were alive, so people would have had to\ncall them 'blok e' or 'hey you'. Perhaps\ntypically, the ancient Romans decided to solve\nthe problem once and for all and martyred them\nboth.\nOn top of that, I doubt that anyone except\nZen masters will see any connection between the\nsaints and sexual potency.\nSo, I thought. That's my original idea down\nthe toilet.\nReceiving\nMany people maintain that giving is always\nbetter than receiving. In the case of Valentine\ncards, however, this is definitely not true (so if\nanyone tells you it is, stand on their toes). The\nreason is obvious: being on the business end of a serious card greatly increases one's chance of a shag.\nHowever, in order to transform probability\ninto reality, you first need to identify your\nadmirer. This can be extremely difficult, but\nthere are a number of useful clues to look out\nfor:\n1. If it is signed, then read the signature. This\nwill give you the name of whoever wrote the\ncard. Well, it will give you a name.\nmessages to their secretaries. Thus you should\nbe on the look out for any shorthand in the card\n(eg. 'Iw ntt gt bd wt u'). It may be that your\nadmirer is something in the city (like a road).\n3. If the card contains extensive usage of the\nword 'mother' (or its derivatives), then, unless\nyou have children, it is almost certainly from\nIce-T( or his derivatives).\nGiving\nAt this time of year, those with a yearning for\ntheir beloved may become bitter, twisted and\nmalodorous if they find they can't express their\nfeelings. Thankfully, many conventions have\nbeen established which enable even the most\nclueless amour ant to produce a card so\nblistering ly erotic that the reader won't know\nwhat's hit them.\nPhysical gestures have a special notation - a cross means kiss and a circle means hug. Thus\n'xx o' means 'two kisses and a hug', and 'oxo'\nmeans 'hug, kiss, hug' (or 'stock cube'). If you\nfind yourself facing a complete game of noughts\nand crosses, I suggest you consult the Karma\nSutra.\nVerse conventions such as 'Roses are red,\nviolets are blue' are very common. This is a good thing, as it ensures the prospective mate is\ntotally clear about flower colours. It can also be\nused to impress them with the depth of your\nknowledge.\nHere are some rhymes that will be useful if\nyou are writing an innuendo-strewn masterpiece:\nred, the Grateful Dead\nblue, ague, shoe, achoo\nyellow, bordello\nhips, apocalypse\nstallion, Pygmalion\nfailure, genitalia\ndomination, irrigation\ntoast rack, Bennallack\nlibido, aikido\n2. Busy executives will often dictate Valentine Okay Lurve Cadets, let's go to work!\nWorked Examples\nIf you still find yourself stumped, despite\nthe symphony of advice I have granted, here\nare some examples to use:\nRoses are red\nAnd violets are blue\nI know you like solvents\nSo I 've sent you some glue\nYou've the loveliest eyes\nThat I 've ever seen\nBut my parts have been caught\nIn a threshing machine\nRoses are red\nAnd violets are blue\nAnd Brezhnev is dead\nSo you '11just have to do\nYour eyes are like diamonds\nThat shine in your mirth\nBut your razor tipped thumbs\nAre like nothing on earth\nRoses are red\nYeltsin is red\nYeltsin! Yeltsin! Yeltsin!\nRoses are red\nAnd violets are blue\nWhen the pentangle 's ready\nWe '11 sacrifice you\nViolets are blue\nAnd roses are red\nWhen you're plucking a chicken\nMust you bite off its head?\n\"Roses are blue\nAnd Violets are red\nOh I do like these Poppies\"\nThe Mad Hatter said\nKino es?, yoH' U.. fV MUt y \u00abOM\u00ab#V**.H TJ THAT "
