    "content": "music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n18 felix Friday 13 March 2009\nMusic\nMusic Editors \u2013 Peter Sinclair, Alex Ashford & James Houghton\nI have, up until recently, been a follower of dance music and rave culture,\npreferring to have wild-eyed fun amid\nfrantic light shows as psytrance, hard-house or drum\u2018n\u2019bass ensue. Although\nI have, since childhood, enjoyed and\nloved dearly bands in which real instruments are played and words sung (Led\nZeppelin, Pink Floyd and the Stones to\nname a few of the more obvious ones),\nI had never really experienced \u2018rock\u2019\nmusic in a live context. Now, this seems\nboth surprising and a shame, given just\nhow many groups and artists there are\nout there showcasing their, often ex-ceptional, talent only a tube ride away\nand on most nights a week.\nIt is amazing how much beautiful\nmusic falls on \u2018deaf\u2019 ears if chart sales\nare to go by: with so much talent it is\namazing so little of it makes it into the\nhit parade. The three acts I saw last\nWednesday at the ICA would fall into\nthis category.\nMumford & Sons\nand Alessi\u2019s Ark\nCaroline Knight\nCaz Knight reviews the folky bluegrass delights of Mumford\n& Sons playing brand new material, with support from Alessi\u2019s\nArk and Sons of Noel and Adrien at the ICA last wednesday.\nMumford and Sons have been one\nof my most listened-to bands since my\nboyfriend flicked on their Myspace last\nOctober (his friend, Winnie, plays ban-jo). It seems as if St Paul\u2019s School has\nbeen a nucleation centre for a number\nof bands emerging as part of the London folk scene, producing the likes of\nNoah and the Whale and the lesser\nknown Cherbourg.\nThe raw, rasping and sexy-voiced\nsinger Marcus also used to drum for\nsinger Laura Marling (who made an\nappearance on the night, albeit as a\nspectator) but now leads the Sons with\nan incredible energy. An energy that\nis sustained throughout every amazing song, each one possessing a certain magic; be it in melody, lyrics or\nthe good old fashioned thrashing of\nthe banjo with a fitting hoedown to go\nwith \u2013 truly stompable stuff. As well as\nold favourites such as \u2018Little Lion Man\u2019,\n\u2018Feel the Tide\u2019 and \u2018White Blank Page\u2019,\nwe were treated to new tunes such as\nthe opening \u2018Sigh No More\u2019 and \u2018The\nCave\u2019, their performance doing nothing\nshort of making me fall deeper in love\nwith them!\nAlessi\u2019s Ark and Sons of Noel and\nAdrian were the glorious supporting\nacts which matched the Sons for talent and were wholly unique. Alessi\nwas probably the youngest person\nat the ICA that night (being only 18)\nand charmed us with her quiet manner and her confusion between Heston\nBlumenthal and emmental cheese. Not\nonly did her songs send shivers down\nthe spine (with lines like: \u201cI want to\nwalk around in your beautiful head/\nAnd hang photographs from your\nwicker bed\u201d) but her voice set her apart\nfrom any other female soloist around\nat the moment (think Bjork crossed\nwith Dolores O\u2019Riordan of the Cranberries). Alessi\u2019s Ark is back in London\nat the end of the month after a stint in\nCalifornia.\nThe other Sons of the night (those\nof Noel and Adrian) stood ten strong\nwith an assortment of instruments\n(flute, horn, double bass, violin, cello\nto name a few, as well as some syn-chronised whistling to go with) which\nreminded me of a sort of hillbilly-von-Trapp-family band, in the best possible\nway. As far as I am aware, the band\nmembers are not related. Special mention must go to the violin player, the\nmajority of whose violin\u2019s strings were\nfreed from their bow on account of his\nenergetic playing!\nCertainly, Sons of Noel and Adrian\nare loved by the headlining Sons and\nfor good reason too.\nThis is music at its most heartfelt,\nmodest and organic, but gives you\nsomething which can\u2019t be recreated\nwith synths and basslines through\nspeakers. Give me folk over rave any\nday.\nIC RADIO\nMonday\n12:00 \u2013 14:00 IKOBETRADIO\n17:00 \u2013 18:00 Capital Cuts\n18:30 \u2013 20:00 Pick \u2018n\u2019 Mix\n20:00 \u2013 21:30 Peer Pressure\n21:30 \u2013 23:30 The Students \t\t\n\t\t Want Techno\nTuesday\n12:00 \u2013 12:45 Capital Science\n13:00 \u2013 14:00 Science at One\n14:00 \u2013 15:30 Beyond the Hype\n17:00 \u2013 18:00 Maggie\u2019s Thatch\n18:00 \u2013 19:00 It\u2019s All About the \t\t\n\t\t Music\n19:00 \u2013 20:00 Believe the Hype\n20:00 \u2013 21:00 White Noise\nWednesday\n13:00 \u2013 14:00 Eye on Science\n14:00 \u2013 15:00 The Indie Show\n16:00 \u2013 18:00 The Flagship \t\t\n\t\t Show\n18:00 \u2013 19:00 1 for the Heads\n19:00 \u2013 20:00 Off Beat\n20:00 \u2013 21:00 DJ Chainz Ice \t\t\n\t\t Cream Hour\n21:00 \u2013 23:00 Pirate IC Radio\nThursday\n12:00 \u2013 13:00 Belated Hype\n13:00 \u2013 14:00 Dead Air Space\n16:00 \u2013 17:00 Papercuts\n18:00 \u2013 19:00 Nath and Yuvi\u2019s \t\t\n\t\t Happy Hour\n19:00 \u2013 21:00 Instrumental\n21:00 \u2013 23:00 The Spectre \t\t\n\t\t Show\nFriday\n13:00 \u2013 14:00 Friday Lunchtime \t\t\n\t\t Fantastic\n14:00 \u2013 15:00 Free Music\n16:00 \u2013 17:00 Science Jam\n17:00 \u2013 18:00 Peter & James\n18:00 \u2013 19:00 SoundBeam\n19:00 \u2013 20:00 The DC Sessions\n20:00 \u2013 00:00 Music Tech \t\t\t\n\t\t Sessions\nSaturday\n11:00 \u2013 13:00 VPT\n15:00 \u2013 17:00 Yes We Can\n17:00 \u2013 18:00 \t\t\t\t\nHypercommunication\nSunday\n16:00 \u2013 17:00 The Pop Show\n17:00 \u2013 19:00 The G and T \t\t\n\t\t Show\n19:00 \u2013 21:00 The Roushan \t\t\n\t\t Alam Show\n21:00 \u2013 23:00 The Crack Den\nAlex Ashford\nMusic Editor\nMore Badly\nDrawn Albums\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n2\nI haven\u2019t written anything this week and Jov says I\u2019m not allowed to do a\nspider diagram because that\u2019s a bit shit.

Alongside the University of\nLeeds and University College London,\nthe UK Transport Research Centre\n(UKTR) will utilise the College\u2019s Centre of Transport Studies; a section of\nthe Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.\nThe \u00a37.75 million research project\nwas unveiled as Lord Andrew Adonis,\nMinister of State for Transport, visited\nImperial for a seminar on biofuel technology by Imperial\u2019s Energy Futures\nLab and Porter Institute.\n\u201cWe are committed to delivering a\nfirst class sustainable transport system\nin this country \u2013 but to do this we need\na first class evidence base. The research\ncoming out of this Centre will be instrumental in ensuring Britain is at the\nforefront of new sustainable transport\ndevelopments,\u201d he stated.\nDirector of the CTS, Professor John\nPolak stressed the importance of nationwide collaboration to push forward\nthe UK\u2019s transport systems.\n\u201cThe UKTRC will formalise the already strong relationship we have with\nour colleagues at Leeds and UCL, and\nmore widely throughout the transport research community. It will also\nprovide new funds, an administrative\ninfrastructure, and an academic focal point for transport research in this\ncountry. Imperial is set to benefit by\nbeing at the very hub of all this activity,\u201d he said.\nIt is not just the three aforementioned university research centres that\nare involved, however. One of the first\nprojects to get underway involves Imperial\u2019s CTS team working with the\nLondon School of Economics. They\nare to start studying projected consequences for London\u2019s major transport\nprojects, including the 2017 Essex to\nMaidenhead Crossrail plans.\nThe UKTR will be funded by a combination of the Department for Transport,theEconomicandSocialResearch\nCouncil (ESRC) and the Scottish Government. What this means for Imperial\nis that new employment opportunities\nare soon to arrive specialising transport\nstudies. The creation of a new administrative workforce is to be installed, as\nwell academic positions PhD and post\ndoctorate to be available.\nSir Roy Anderson, Rector at Imperial, was naturally keen to have Imperial contributing to national research\non such a large scale.\n\u201cIt was a pleasure to welcome Lord\nAdonis to Imperial for a visit which\nunderlines the importance of science\nand technology in research intensive\nuniversities to maintaining the UK\u2019s\ncompetitive edge.\u201d\nDina Ismail\nNews Correspondent\nImperial College is facing substantial\ncuts this year after losing out in the\nallocation of \u00a31.6bn of state research\nfunding in favour of lower ranking uni-versities. It is one of many members of\nthe Russell Group of leading universities to be allocated below-inflation increases in the coming year\u2019s grant for\nresearch and teaching.\nThe financial allocations reflect in\npart the results of the 2008 Research\nAssessment Exercise (RAE), which\nmeasured the quality of academic research at all universities. These quality\nprofiles were used by the Higher Education Funding Council for England\n(HEFCE) to allocate its \u00a38bn budget\nfor 2009-10. Although the budget has\ngone up by 4% since last year Imperial will not be seeing the benefits of\nthis increase as more money has been\nredirected to former polytechnics and\nsmaller universities that have shown\nstrong performance in research fields.\nA winner in this grant redistribution is Wolverhampton University,\nwhere research funding will rise from\n\u00a3138,000 a year to \u00a32.4m. Among its\nworld-leading research identified by\nthe RAE were linguistics and library\nmanagement.\nImperial has not been the worst affected by the cuts as the proportion of\nresearch funding protected for science\nstands at just under \u00a31bn. Nevertheless it will still be hard hit, as potentially losing out on \u00a315m of funding\nmay have knock on effects on current\nresearch being carried out and may\ntranslate into job cuts in certain de-partments. Imperial\u2019s Rector Sir Roy\nAnderson said: \u201cAt a time when the\nUK is looking to its science, technology and medicine powerhouses for\nideas and innovations to help lead the\neconomic recovery, it can\u2019t have been\nintended that we could be reducing the\nshare of research funds to institutions\nwhich have demonstrated sustained\nexcellence across successive research\nassessments.\u201d\n\u201cIt is surprising that Imperial College\nLondon, ranked top of all UK institutions for its proportion of research,\njudged world-leading or internationally excellent, should suffer a real decline\nin its allocation of research funding.\u201d\nCritics have warned that this year\u2019s\narrangement will spread cash too thinly and starve the best universities of resources needed to remain internationally competitive and attract pioneers in\ntheir field. The think tank Policy Exchange has criticised how funds have\nbeen allocated calling it a \u201csqueamishness about supporting an academic\nelite.\u201d Further criticism has been voiced\nas in addition to the significant funding increases, a further \u00a3400m will be\nspent on former polytechnics to help\nrecruit and retain students from disadvantaged backgrounds. This is despite a report last month, which said\nthe number of deprived teenagers going to university has hardly increased\nbetween 2001 and 2007 despite \u00a3400m\nalready having been spent. The cash\nfor such a scheme has been allocated at\na time when the country\u2019s best universities are contending with financial setbacks to their research departments.\nConservative Shadow Secretary\nDavid Willetts attacked the government\u2019s funding strategy saying, \u201cThe\ncut in funding for some of our leading institutions is a mess of ministers\u2019\nown making\u2026it is a great pity that our\nworld-class institutions like Imperial\nand the LSE have lost out, especially\nwhen we need them so badly at tough\ntimes like this.\u201d\nThe disagreement over slashing of\ngovernment funding for elite institutions and its redistribution to the less\nhighly regarded former polytechnics\nunderlines the \u2018class war\u2019 between uni-versities. Supporters say the academic\ncaliber of former polytechnics has long\nbeen underrated and reform of an elitist system is long overdue. The effect,\nif any, of spreading funding to more\nuniversities, rather than backing the\nbest institutions will no doubt become\nquickly apparent.\nBloody violence at student\nfavourite House of Coffees\nPopular Imperial College student\nhaunt, House of Coffees (also known\nas Caffe Forum), on Gloucester Road\nwas the scene of a bloody altercation\non Tuesday night which resulted in\nthe arrests of two men and left another\nman requiring medical attention for a\nhead injury.\nAt approximately 6:20pm, an argument erupted in the street between\ntwo men, thought to be of Eastern European descent, and a Lebanese man\nwho was with a Pakistani friend.\nThe argument moved indoors when\nthe Lebanese man was followed into\nthe coffee house and challenged by one\nof the Eastern European men.\nThe exchange became more and\nmore heated, with spitting and swear-ing, despite the efforts of staff to calm\nthe situation. The Eastern European\nmen continued acting aggressively and\nthe Asian men both picked up chairs in\na bid to defend themselves, according\nto witnesses.\nThe severity of the fracas escalated\nviolently when the Lebanese man hit\none of the Europeans over the head\nwith a chair. One young customer on\nthe periphery of the incident suffered\na minor injury to her head when the\nraised chair smashed into an overhanging chandelier causing shards of\nglass to rain down.\nDespite a prolonged period immobile on the floor and a very bloody\nwound to his forehead, the injured\nman refused to wait for the ambulance\nto arrive.\nBoth European men soon left the\ncaf\u00e9 only to be caught by the emergency services less than 30 minutes\nlater. One of the pair was arrested in\nthe street, whilst the injured man was\nstopped near Tesco before being taken\nto hospital.\nMeanwhile, both Asian men remained at the scene. Shortly after the\npolice arrived the Lebanese man responsible for causing the injury was\narrested on grounds of assault. Police\ncordoned off the coffee house before\ntaking statements from witnesses.\nThe cause of the quarrel was unclear,\nalthough it\u2019s thought that the two European men were both drunk, walking along Gloucester Road when they\nencountered the Asian men outside of\nthe caf\u00e9, before following them inside.\nHouse of Coffees is a favourite local caf\u00e9 amongst Imperial College\nstudents, renowned for its student-friendly prices and late opening times.\nThe fight flared up, out of the blue and\ncame as a shock to everyone in the\ncaf\u00e9, especially having happened so\nearly during the evening.\nCurrently it\u2019s unknown whether either of the men arrested have been\ncharged, or how serious the Eastern\nEuropean man\u2019s head injury turned out\nto be. For the owners of House of Coffee, however, hopefully this was a freak\noccurrence and it\u2019s business as usual\nfrom now on.\nTom Roberts\n& Kadhim Shubber\nFrom left: Staff at House of Coffee mopping up blood on the floor, the Pakistani man (left) and the Lebanese\nman speaking to police after the incident and the scene outside the cafe after police cordoned it off\nImperial minds the gap with\nTransport Research Centre\nDan Wan\nNews Editor\n\u00a315m\n\u2022 in lost\nfunding\n\u00a32m\n\u2022 gain for\nWolverhampton Shadow Secretary David Willetts has called the cut \u201ca mess\u201d\nRector seeks to increase\nhome student\u2019s fees\nKirsty Patterson\n& Kadhim Shubber\nIn a Question and Answer Session with\nImperial\u2019s Rector Sir Roy Anderson,\nstaff were told to expect to see an increase in tuition fees to double or even\ntriple the current rate. In answer to a\nquestion from the floor the Rector described future tuition fees as being in\nthe region of \u00a36,000-\u00a39,000 with Universities taking advantage of the true\nmarket, charging different amounts for\ndifferent courses. He said home and\nEU students were a financial burden\non universities, pointing out that \u201cwe\nlose money on these [home and EU\nstudents] and the comparison between\nthe overseas fee and the home fee is far\ntoo wide\u201d. Overseas students currently\npay \u00a315,500 whilst home students pay\n\u00a33,225.\nTheRectordefendedtheincreasesaying that they would have to be accompanied by an increase in the number\nof scholarships given to \u201cstudents who\ncome from less wealthy backgrounds\u201d.\nHe said that Imperial would have to\n\u201cfind ways of supporting\u201d less well-off\nstudents by generating a \u201csignificant\nbody of fellowships and scholarships\u201d\nlike American universities.\nThe Rector had previously told felix\nthat he expected Tuition Fees to rise\nbut did not want to see them in excess\nof \u00a310,000. Today\u2019s announcement\nremains in line with these figues but\ncould see them at the top end of the\n\u00a310,000 mark.\nA University College Union (UCU)\npoll in 2008 showed that 55% of British adults wanted a university system\nthat was completely free but the Rector\u2019s comments come at a time of financial uncertainty for Imperial as it\nhas just lost out on \u00a315m of state research funding as reported on the opposite page.\nImperial\u2019s previous Rector, who\nwas one of the biggest advocates of\n\u00a315,000 tuition fees at their concep-tion, backed down on the issue in 2006\ntelling students attending a Question\nand Answer Session in the Union Dining Hall in Beit Quad that he would\nnot want to see tuition fees in excess\nof \u00a35,000.\nThe Question and Answer session\nwith Sir Roy took place in the Great\nHall with overflow space in the Pippard Lecture Theatre. The event\nwas streamed live online by College\nComunications with a Podcast available sometime tomorrow morning.\nImperial student news website Live!\nhas been assured that the questions\nand answers won\u2019t be edited from the\nPodcast.

Based on a hugely successful comic book series by Alan\nMoore and Dave Gibbons, Watchmen\nas a movie has been in development\nsince the early \u201890s. Many people have\nclaimed it was unfilmable because of\nits sweeping narrative and spectacular\nand iconic imagery, and many fans are\nstill unconvinced that director Synder\nwill be able to do the graphic novel any\njustice.\nThe plot? Well it is hard to explain\nbut it starts with an assassination that\nmakes three former superheroes come\nout of hiding to investigate what is going on. That is the basic plot, and by\nsaying the rest I think it would spoil\nit. It is mainly a complex political web\nwhich draws the lives of the characters\nin and out of one another, with the saving of the world aspect a subplot that\ncomes closer to the forefront as the\nstory progresses. I know this is vague,\nbut I think that not knowing the storyline makes the film much more interesting and watchable (take my word\nfor it!).\nAs you can tell from the stars above, I\nliked it. I liked it a lot. But I hadn\u2019t read\nthe comic before I had seen the film,\nso to make sure I wrote as objective review as possible, I went to the cinema\nwith two friends of mine who had both\npreviously read the original source\nmaterial, so that they could tell me\ntheir views on the film. One of them\nloved it and the other hated it. I think\nWatchmen is a Marmite-type of film\n\u2013 you either get it or you don\u2019t. And I\npersonally don\u2019t think many people in\nthe general public will. It is the kind of\nfilm that the critics love because it has\n\u2018deep\u2019 political meanings and is well di-rected, so I was careful not to jump on\ntheir bandwagon. As a superhero film,\nI\u2019m not sure it works, but as a political\naction/drama centred around a gang of\nformer superheroes, it is great.\nFor starters, three things about this\nfilm bugged me. The soundtrack made\nme wince (especially during the sex\nscene \u2013 why was \u2018Hallelujah\u2019 playing\nin the background?), the plot was at\nBardem lives every man\u2019s dream with two lovely ladies at his side.\nWatchmen finally arrives at the cinemas and comic book lovers are clearly split into \u2018love it\u2019, \u2018hate it\u2019 camps.\nWhy do people never call back after\na date that you thought went so well?\nWhy does the person you are obviously\nflirting with barely look at you and act\nlike you aren\u2019t even there? Why is it so\nhard just to get someone to notice you,\neven when you try your hardest to look\nattractive? The answer for everyone\nout there who has ever experienced\nthis: they just aren\u2019t that into you.\nBased on a self-help book of the same\nname, He\u2019s Just Not That Into You, takes\nthe idea of why people don\u2019t return\ncalls and never speak to you again and\nplaces it into the lives of an all-star cast\nwho re-enact our deepest fears about\ndating and relationships.\nFor example, take Gigi (Ginnifer\nGoodwin), an attractive twenty-some-thing woman who finds that every man\nshe goes on a date with never calls her\nback, even when she thought they had\nclicked. Why does no one want to go\nout with her? Is there something wrong\nwith her? Or is there a problem with all\nthe men that she is attracted to?\nThe film lays it out straight down the\nline from the very beginning by telling\nwomen that if a man wants to be with\nyou, he will be with you. Men don\u2019t\nplay mind games \u2013 if they aren\u2019t into\nyou, they just won\u2019t see you again. So\ndon\u2019t tell yourself that they went on a\nbusiness trip or have a meeting or are\non holiday \u2013 they just don\u2019t want to go\nout with you. These messages are told\ncomically throughout the film, revealing secrets of both the male and female\npsyche as the different character\u2019s lives\nweave in and out of one another as the\nplots progress. One couple decide that\nif they can\u2019t get married, they should\nbreak up. Another happily married\ncouple discover that maybe they don\u2019t\nknow each other as well as they might\nthink. A beautiful, young woman realises that when you are really attracted\nto someone, it doesn\u2019t matter if they\nhave a wife: you should just go for it.\nThe trailer promises a fiery affair, a\nlove triangle, loads of Catalan sun and\nLatino meat (Javier Bardem, Penelope\nCruz). Unfortunately the trailer also\noveremphasises the tragic slant of the\nmovie which, in actuality, is not as\nmelodramatic and soap-opera-like as\nyou\u2019d be forgiven to conclude from the\nteasers.\nThe story is deceptively simple \u2013\ntwo young, American women (Hall as\nVicky and Johansson as Cristina) arrive\nin Barcelona to spend the summer with\na well-off relative of Vicki. At a routine\ndinner in an ordinary restaurant late\nat night, their holiday suddenly gets a\ntwist when they are approached by Juan\nAntontio Gonzalo, a bohemian, fully\nSpanish-blooded painter (Bardem)\nwho offers them exactly what Cristina\nis looking for \u2013 a passionate adventure.\nNaturally things get a bit more complicated as Vicky, who doesn\u2019t trust Juan\nAntonio and is not stirred by his open\n\u2018womanising\u2019 and mix of macho looks\nwith an artistic soul, falls in love with\nthe exciting stranger. But nothing can\nSeriously, he\u2019s not into you!\nThe acting is very good, with eye\ncandy for both men and women in\nthe form of Scarlett Johansson, Justin\nLong and many others. Jennifer Aniston shines in a likeable role not too\ndissimilar from her Friends counter-part, and Jennifer Connelly proves her\nacting merits by tackling the emotional\nscenes. Bradley Cooper is also good as\na badly-behaved husband, and Drew\nBarrymore makes the most of her\ncameo. Although the script is sometimes obvious and the plot is fairly pre-dictable, it is hard not to like the film.\nIt provides some genuinely funny moments that are juxtaposed with some\ntouching scenes. For those of you who\nget really engrossed in these types of\nfilms, there is a nail-biting moment\nin one of the plots when you consider\nthat the couple may not get together,\nas it could go either way. The ending is\ngood as there are a few happy moments\nalong with sad ones, and the unhappy\nbits are realistic, therefore making the\nfilm as a whole stronger (because I like\na bit of harsh reality). Let\u2019s just say that\nit is good to see women who don\u2019t sell\nthemselves short by settling for less!\nIt is a fairly forgettable, run-of-the\nmill chick-flick that people will en-Woody Allen takes a new look at love\nVicky, Cristina, Barcelona\nHHHHK\nDirector: Woody Allen\nWriter: Woody Allen\nCast: Javier Bardem\nScarlett Johansson\nRebecca Hall\npoints incomprehensible (and this is\nwhy reading the book before seeing it\nis a good idea) and the character of Dr.\nManhattan (played by Billy Crudup)\nwas dry. But these critiques aside, everything else was brilliant. The direction was great: the film looked dazzling \u2013 drawing you in from the very\nbeginning until the end. The images\nwere very iconic and memorable, doing the comic books justice as well as\ngiving the film depth and style. The\nacting was also very good; Jackie Earle\nHaley as Rorschach and Jeffery Dean\nMorgan as The Comedian stole the\nshow with two dominating perform-ances. Patrick Wilson who played the\nNightowl was also very good and although Malin Akerman as the second\nSilk Spectre wasn\u2019t as convincing as the\nrest, she looked the part and held her\nown. Saying that, both Billy Crudup\n(Dr. Manhattan) and Matthew Goode\n(Ozymandias) were not very good in\ntheir roles but mainly because their\ncharacters were bland and forgettable,\nalthough crucial to the plot.\nThe special effects are amazing: Rorschach\u2019s changing ink-blotted face is a\nmarvel and the fight scenes look very\nslick and cool. And that is something\nelse I must come on to \u2013 the action\nscenes. After seeing 300, I had high\nhopes for the director, and he did not\nlet me down. The action sequences\nwere by far the best parts of the film,\nand although the Matrix-style slow\nmotion shots were overused and un-original, the beat-\u2019um-up gory action\nwas very exciting. The best part of the\nfilm was when a few of the characters\nbreak into a prison to help one of their\nfriends, only to be encountered by\nsome very angry and very aggressive\ninmates.\nThe gore is not for the faint of heart:\nyou will see some very grisly bits that\nmake you grit your teeth in disgust.\nOne of these moments includes a bone\nbeing snapped out of an arm, and another features a meat cleaver and a\nbald head. Oh dear. After all, this is an\n18-rated film; but judging by how some\nthe audience reacted to the naked Dr.\nManhattan, whose neon blue penis is\non show throughout the entire film,\nyou wouldn\u2019t have guessed it.\nThe overall tone of the film is very\ndark and unknowingly uncertain, as it\ntakes quite a long time before the final\nunveiling of why everything has happened is revealed. This helps add an\nunpredictable quality to the film, but\nonly if you have not read the book.\nAlthough the story is pretty flat and\ndrags on for longer than it should,\nWatchmen is a spectacle to behold, as\nit pleases the eye as well as the brain,\nsince it gets you thinking about political issues you might not otherwise\nponder. It isn\u2019t the revelation that people are saying it is, but it does have a\nvery uncharacteristically, different feel,\nwith a strongly anti-Hollywood end-ing. It is refreshing to see such a different movie, something that isn\u2019t your\nusual Hollywood hogwash.\nSo if you like regular superhero\nfilms, like Spiderman, you might not\nlike Watchmen because it is a lot more\nedgy, and is definitely not a happy clap-py piece of cinema. Watchmen is the\nkind of film that everyone will have an\nopinion about, from the doting fans to\nthe unaware masses. So go and watch\nit, and the only thing I can guarantee\nyou is this: you will either love it, or\nyou will hate it.\njoy when they watch it, but probably\nwouldn\u2019t be too bothered about seeing again. Even men who are dragged\ninto the cinema by a woman can find\nsomething to like about it, even if it is\nScarlett Johansson\u2019s cracking body. It is\ngood that someone has finally decided\nto tell women the truth about how\nmen think, but I doubt many women\nwill listen to it (just keep telling yourselves that because he winked at you, it\nmeans you will get married!).\nSo for everyone out there in need of\nrelationship advice, take heed: if they\naren\u2019t trying to get you, then they just\naren\u2019t that into you.\nJonathan Dakin\nFilm Editor\nZuzanna Blaszczak\nFilm Editor\nhappen as Cristina also has the hots for\nthe artist and Vicky is in fact engaged.\nThat\u2019s all very tragic and really not that\ninteresting but throw in Juan\u2019s slightly\npsychopathic ex-wife (Marie Elena),\nwith Penelope Cruz in an Oscar winning performance and the film becomes an explosion of pure, eccentric\nand slightly crazy energy as the story\nbegins swerving surprisingly from side\nto side.\nIn all fairness, it\u2019s not just Penelope\nCruz that makes the movie; the assembled cast works perfectly together and makes a stretched story very\nbelievable.\nIt\u2019s enough to look at Johansson to\nknow Cristina is forever fruitlessly\nlooking for something she wants but\nnever knows what it is, while Hall effortlessly plays the down-to-earth\nfriend taken aback by the sudden realisation that when God wants to punish\nyou, he answers your prayers. And of\ncourse Bardem is fantastic as the embodiment of the lustful, yet tender and\nsensitive, lover.\nEven with a talented and well -tuned\ncast, the film would probably be a rather significant failure if it weren\u2019t directed by someone like Woody Allen.\nThis legendary director, who suffered\nthrough a period of ample number\nof misses recently, is one of the few\npeople who could pull this project\noff. Allen plays with narrative styles,\nthemes, ideas, shots and emotions in\na virtuoso offering in step with the\namazing soundtrack of Spanish guitar.\nThe movie becomes great fun because\nthe director is having fun, constantly\nwinking at us and making sure we don\u2019t\nstart taking things too seriously (in\ntypical Allen fashion). Beware though\nas the humour is rather sophisticated\nand finding pure laugh-out-loud moments can be tricky. But if you enjoy\nlaughing at bizarrely quirky events that\nseem unreal yet so commonplace at\nthe same time, you\u2019ll find a truck load\nin Vicky, Cristina, Barcelona.\nThe true genius of the movie is that\ncoming out of the cinema you realise\nthat somewhere between the comedy\nand the tragedy, you\u2019ve been told a\ntale well worth thinking over as it just\nmight change some of your set views\nabout love.\nIf superheroes were to have a convention, this is what it would look like.\nA bit of eye candy for the men, enjoying a pedicure\n\n"

Despite this, the medic crowd were out\nin force supporting the Medicals to the\nvery end, much to our appreciation.\nThe Medicals were out for revenge,\nwith one of the more unfortunate play-ers, Sabrina Black, standing on crutches on the sideline as a result of Emma\nBerisford\u2019s abuse from the last match.\nThe match began with a strong\nMedical start, however they couldn\u2019t\nfinish off the well worked play, especially since the Imperial pace started\nreally slowly as they expected to win.\nThe quick tempo from the Medicals\ncould be due to the fact that this game\nwas also to keep them from being rel-egated.

For\nsome their first competition lay ahead,\nand for others, the experienced, their\nsecond. In the heat of a match none of\nthis matters.\nNo nerves, no fear. The mind focuses\nnot on the dripping sweat and aching\nmuscles, nor the weary eyes, but on the\nflood of memories from past training\nsessions, evaluating the next move, the\npre-emptive strike. What followed by\nthe teams, Imperial Tequila and Mojito, was a display of pure determination and skill.\nBoth teams eased to early victories in\nthe often tricky opening match, defeating both UCL second and third teams,\nwith impressive scores of 45-27 (Tequi-la) and 45-32 (Mojito). Imperial Mojito\ncontinued to put in a strong performance against UCL first, but eventually\nsuccumbed to pressure against a very\nstrong UCL team.\nImperial Tequila\u2019s second match\nversus Kings was not so clear cut. An\nevenly matched and intensely fought\nstruggle led to a 44-44 deadlock. All\neyes watched on intently as the competitors took their positions. In a display of their skill and confidence, Imperial Tequila took victory. Cheering\nensued.\nGiving firm opposition, both teams\nlost their third matches against the two\nstrongest sides in the competition, with\nTequila losing to UCL1 and Mojito losing to ULU a close 45-37. Mojito put up\na strong performance against the Kings\nteam which gave Tequila such trouble,\nwinning 45-38, an excellent result.\nThe competition closed with what\nsome claim to be the only match of the\ncompetition, the Imperial Tequila-Mojito showdown. The outcome of this\nmatch was all important for the final\nstandings of the contest, with a medal\nposition at stake.\nA closely battled, and needless to say\nheated match once again came down to\none point. The weight of team pride on\ntheir already weary shoulders tortured\nthe mind. Imperial Mojito overcame\nthe pressure to win a well deserved final point.\nWith their victory Mojito took an\noverall third place in the competition,\nawarded bronze medal for a fantastic\nperformance on the day. All involved\ngave impressive displays, a sign of a\nstrong future for IC Fencing club.\nCelebrations were short lived how-ever, with post competition drinks\nJason Lloyd\nat the union.

You\u2019re\neither studying something you\u2019re\ncompletely passionate about, something you did very well at high school\n(before the novelty died) and you have\nno idea why you\u2019re here but the folks\nback home have great expectations,\nor you\u2019re somewhere in between\n\u2013 check.\nHowever far along in your studies\nyou are, albeit Bachelors, Masters or\nPhD, the big questions always looms:\nwhat am I going to do with my life\nnext?\n\u2013 Post-graduate studies/ post-doc-torate studies/ post-post studies... All\nfairly self-explanatory. All getting you\ncloser to a life of research, allowing\nyou to research something at the apex\nof your field; potentially world-chang-ing in itself, the holy grail of which is\nto be awarded a Nobel Prize, sometime down the line.\n\u2013 Finish up whatever study you\u2019re\ndoing and go into industry. Bad times\nnow, so only the best and brightest\nwill get the coveted ball-breaking finance jobs.\nThe rest will have to look within\ntheir respective degree-related industries to find a job that inspires, or go\ninto teaching (a steady job educating\nthe young minds of the future \u2013 very\nrespectable).\n\u2013 Start up your own company, be\nyour own boss, someone not working\nunder anyone else\u2019s orders \u2013 just you\nClimbing the ladder by saving the world?\nand the endless stretch of horizon that\nscreams POTENTIAL. Apply the best\nof everything that you\u2019ve ever known\nabout yourself and create something\nin its reflection.\nStarting your own company might\nsound scary to you but the short of it\nis, there\u2019s never a better time to startup than now and that\u2019s especially true\nwhilst you\u2019re at university. Why?\n1. Competitions \u2013 you can earn\nmoney just by having an idea. Imperial Entrepreneurs has just launched\nIdeas Empowered, a business idea\ncompetition.\nThe competition has two rounds,\nwith a 1500-word executive summary\nsubmission on 30th of March; the top\nteams go to the finals on the 1st of\nMay and pitch their ideas to panel of\njudges/investors. Winners will receive\na \u00a33000 cash-prize as well as in-kind\nservices and benefits such as 6 months\nof mentoring by Connect London,\nprofiles/ads on Cmypitch.com and introductions to investors.\nTeams also get the chance to be\nmentored by professional entrepreneurs throughout the competition\nand learn essential business skills at\nour workshops.\n2. A haven of co-founders. Look\naround you. You go to uni with some\nof the brightest, technical minds in the\ncountry. Somewhere you\u2019ll find someone who\u2019s into creating stuff, up for a\nchallenge, or willing to give it all a go.\n3. The UK has some of the most startup friendly places on Earth. London is\none in particular \u2013 if not the financial\ncapital of the world, the Government\nis very supportive of small enterprises\nwhether logistically or by means of tax\ndeductions. The tech scene is booming also despite the recession.\n4. Access to tools and facilities. The\nlibrary, research databases, computer\nlabs, university lecturers and Imperial\nInnovations are all resources on campus that can add value to your entrepreneurial endeavours.\n5. Few major obligations. No mortgage to pay and no family to feed. Most\nof us are living off student-loans and\npart-time jobs. This gives you time to\ngrow your venture in between classes\nand friends.\n6. An unbelievable learning experi-ence. Entrepreneurs average 3.8 failures before final success. Even though\nyou may not succeed the first time, as\nlong as you give it your all and do your\nbest, you\u2019ll learn a hell of a lot out of\nthe experience.\n7. There\u2019s still time. If you start up\nnow and you fail, there\u2019s still time for\nyou to go into post-grad studies, into\nindustry, or give it another round\u2026\nIf these reasons convince you that\nstarting up a sci-tech company might\nbe a good thing for you, maybe check\nout Imperial Innovations or join Imperial Entrepreneurs to learn more.\nOur next event on 16th March at\n6:20pm, in Blackett LecT1, Prince\nConsort Road will detail everything\nyou need to know about the upcoming\ncompetition and other opportunities\nto discover how you can make your\nwild ideas about how to improve our\nMarita Cheng &\nNiccolo Corsini\nBig Bang Fair: Inspiring future scientists\nThe biggest ever UK celebration of\nyoung people\u2019s achievement in science\nand engineering ended with prizes being awarded to students aged 11-19 at\nthe QEII Centre, London, last week.\n\u2018The Big Bang\u2019, the first UK Young\nScientists and Engineers Fair, was the\nvenue for the biggest-ever finals of\ncompetitions in science, technology,\nengineering and mathematics to inspire even greater numbers of young\npeople to study related subjects.\nAmong the many projects that competed for several valuable prizes, were\nthe following:\n\u2013 Exams Stink: a scented wrist band\nworn when studying and then in an\nexam to aid recall of information; it resulted in a 10% improvement in exam\nperformance.\n\u2013 A martial arts dummy especially\ndesigned to suit many different martial\nart styles.\n\u2013 A computer screen for people who\nsuffer from colour-blindness.\n\u2013 A low-cost, solar-powered water\nheating system for households in the\ndeveloping world.\nAll the students I spoke to were enthusiastic about their projects and\nwould love to see their projects commercially available to other people as\nMico Tatalovic\nScience Editor\nA\ns the lights dim, I stretch\nout my legs onto the\nempty chair in front of\nme and start to relax.\nIt\u2019s been a long couple\nof days ferrying children round \u2018The\nYoung Scientists and Engineers Fair\u2019,\nand the lecture sessions provide welcome relief.\nBut my half-sleep is soon interrupted when the teacher three rows in\nfront hisses at a pupil, telling them to\nget their feet off the chair. That tone of\nvoice still scares me. So much so that\nmy legs also move back to the floor and\nI try to pay attention.\nThe lecture is about the Bloodhound super Sonic Car. It is packed\nwith breathtaking facts about the\npower of the vehicle they are building\nand even more breathtaking footage\nof the Thrust cars that have kept the\nlandspeed record in Britain.\nRichard Noble, who headed Thrust\nand now heads Bloodhound, enthusiastically takes the audience of a hundred teenagers through the history\nof landspeed record attempts and the\nhopes they have for this one.\nAlong with the school parties, I am\nenthralled by Noble. The teenager in\nme is wowed by talk of 100,000 horsepower from the combination of a twin\njet engine and a rocket mounted on\nthe rear of the car.\nBloodhound will travel at over 1,000\nmiles per hour \u2013 1.4 times the speed of\nsound. And all the engineering, and all\nBloodhound landspeed record project\nthe engineers, are British.\nThe project aims at inspiring a new\ngeneration of engineers in this country.\nPrevious generations had Concorde,\nthe Vulcan and the Lightning but current engineering successes are mainly\nkept private. The list of defence technologies produced by the MOD are,\nunderstandably, secret. Even Formula\nOne teams are cagey about going public with their developments \u2013 it makes\nit easier for their competitors to copy.\nThe landspeed record is different.\nPromoting the technology it uses does\nnot affect national security, nor does it\naffect competition like in motorsport.\nSo the government have created an\neducation programme around the car.\nSchools can visit the build site. Teachers are offered curriculum materials\ndeveloped around the Bloodhound\nprogramme and the website enables\nJessica Bland reports from the first \u2018Big Bang Fair\u2019 asking if the Bloodhound Project is enough to make you\nwish you were an engineer?\npupils to keep up-to-date with its\nprogress. There are also numerous\nevents and activities like this lecture.\nBloodhound had the attention of\neveryone in the room, but is this\nenough to inspire a new generation of\nengineers?\nUndoubtedly the career choices of\nsome scientists and engineers are influenced by this kind of iconic project.\nIndeed Paul Drayson, the Minister of\nState for Science and Innovation, says\nhis own son, inspired by the Thrust\nprogramme, changed from a media to\nan engineering degree.\nBut this kind of inspiration is not\nenough by itself. Other things need\nto change. For example, the wages of\na graduate engineer or scientist are\nnot comparable to those of finance\ngraduates.\nThe prestige is not comparable to\nart, journalism or even the Civil Service. Unfortunately, at the moment, engineering and science cannot promise\nin pay and status what other careers\ncan.\nA new initiative backed by the\nPrince of Wales hopes to help rectify this: offering PhDs \u00a320,000 a year.\nAnd the increasing interest in climate\nscience and particle colliders means\nthat science is slowly shedding some\nof its dull reputation. These changes,\nthough, are incremental.\nBloodhound is an inspiring project\n\u2013 it even inspired me after too many\nhours in the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in Westminster where\nthe fair took place last week. But it\ndidn\u2019t make me want to become a\nengineer.\nI am still glad I left experimental\nsciences after my undergraduate de-gree. No matter how exciting it can\nbe, it takes a stronger person than me\nto work in a lab all day for less money\nand sometimes less respect than your\npeers.\nBloodhound is to break the current land speed limit and reach speed of up to 1,000 mph. Will this be\nenough to encourage and inspire a new generation of scientists and engineers?\nCan science help you make you first million? Could new start-ups\ndesign commercially available solar-powered cars, for example?\nAlongside the Bloodhound, Virgin Galactic was another big hit with the school kids at the first annual \u2018Big\nBang Fair\u2019 last week.\nwell. When asked if they thought they\nwould win any awards, students were\nmostly shy but hopeful.\nScience and Innovation Minister,\nLord Drayson said: \u201cThis competition\nhas highlighted the reality of science\ntoday, it\u2019s exciting, fascinating and\nshapes all our lives. Young scientists\ntoday will shape our future tomorrow\n\u2013 which is why competitions like this\nare so important to celebrate young\nBritish talent.\u201d\nSir Anthony Cleaver, Chairman of\nthe Engineering and Technology Board\n(ETB) and Co-patron of \u2018The Big Bang\u2019,\nsaid: \u201cThe UK economy needs a strong\nscience and engineering sector if it is\nto break through the current economic\ndifficulties and provide a strong basis for growth. Seeing 200 incredible\nprojects from across science and engineering gave all who attended \u2018The Big\nBang\u2019 great heart that we witnessed a\ndefining moment, igniting interest in\nscience and engineering for students\nand starting something that will continue to grow \u2013 which is why we named\nit \u2018The Big Bang\u2019. \u201d\nAs well as exhibiting their projects,\nstudents also had the opportunity to\nwatch interactive exhibits and talk to\npeople from various companies and\nscientific institutions.\nPlans are already underway for next\nyear\u2019s competition in Manchester.\nEcoBuild: Future of sustainable development\nOlivia Sharp\nScience Reporter\nLast week, ecogirl packed her lunch\nand went off to Ecobuild at Earl\u2019s\nCourt, the world\u2019s biggest event dedicated to sustainable building. After\nchecking out the zero-carbon house\nand watching three very important\npolitical types discuss the politics of\nsustainability, I threw some questions\nat Kevin McCloud, that posh guy off\nGrand Designs.\nZEDfactory are another company pioneering sustainable housing design. We might all be living in these\nhobbit-esque RuralZED houses in the future.\nThe zero carbon\nhouse\nMeeting Kevin\nMcCloud\nThe Politics of\nClimate Change\nEcobuild wasn\u2019t short on spectacle \u2013\none of the main attractions was a full\nsize, zero-emission house, inside the\nexhibition centre. The cannily named\nECO2\nH2\nOUSE invited people to go and\nhave a nose around and check out its\nmany emission reducing features.\nThe house retains heat far more efficiently than the average house, using\ninnovative technology instead of traditional insulation.\nThe walls contain \u2018phase change material\u2019, much like the gel inside winter\nhand warmers. This can store large\namounts of energy when it melts and\nsolidifies, which means excess energy\nfrom the house\u2019s rooftop solar panels\nand wind turbine can be collected for\ninsulation or heating water.\nLighting is provided by LED spot and\nstrip lights, which use a minute 15% of\nthe energy of incandescent bulbs, and\n50% of that used by fluorescent tube\nlights.\nECO2\nH2\nOUSE\u2019s designers at ECO2H2\nO (pronounced eco) want to \u201ccut out\nthe greenwash, and make real progress\nin moving sustainability forward\u201d. The\ncompany are growing in success and\nhave high hopes for ECO2\nH2\nOUSE.\nCelebrity architect Kevin McCloud led\na discussion at Ecobuild on the future\nof sustainable development. Lucky for\nme, I stole a few words with the God of\nGrand Designs by stalking him around\nEarl\u2019s Court until he got scared and\nbegged me to leave him alone.\nSo Kevin, what has been the best\nthing you\u2019ve taken away from this\nyear\u2019s Ecobuild?\nI\u2019ve got a lot of great new contacts.\nThe rainwater products here are really interesting and there\u2019s definitely a\nfuture for those. Things are really happening in the business side [of sustainable development], that\u2019s really why\nI\u2019m here.\nWhat is the future for sustainable\ndevelopment?\nWell, government targets seem to be\nas far into the future as 2050. We need\nto be getting into action now, be well\non our way by 2020, and have achieved\nthem by 2030. Sustainability and climate change should be the main priority for our government.\nThe arena hosted talks from various\nimportant people involved in sustainability and the environment. \u2018The Politics of Climate Change\u2019 was an assuring\ndiscussion between three political fig-ures: Michael Heseltine, former Deputy PM; Tim Yeo, MP and former Minister for the Environment; and Michael\nMeacher, MP and former Minister of\nState for the Environment.\nAll three men stressed the importance of the economics for tackling climate change, but were optimistic that\ntargets could be achieved.\nHeseltine struck a cautionary tone\nat the start: in our current economic\nsituation, climate change has moved\ndown the list of priorities: \u2018Anything\nthat puts up prices is politically difficult \u2013 increasing taxes on petrol would\nbe very effective in cutting emissions,\nbut a very unpopular decision by any\ngovernment.\u2019\nTim Yeo stressed that the environment will become top priority again,\nas the business community continues\nto see the opportunities and threats\nof climate change. \u2018Politicians were\nin denial about global warming until\n2006, but business was miles ahead,\nassessing the economic benefits of going green.\u2019 He also noted that the UK\nis behind Europe in terms of building\nstandards, so in the next few years will\ngo to efforts to improve.\nThe role of developing countries in\nglobal warming was discussed, with\nagreement that countries such as India and China are helping more than\nappreciated. Meacher believes these\ncountries are \u2018victims of the eco-crisis\u2019, and cannot be expected to follow\nEurope unless we are willing to lead.\nMichael Yeo noted that China has\ntighter vehicle emissions than the US.\nOverall, there was agreement that\nnot enough is being done to meet government targets regarding emissions\nreductions. They all agreed that political parties should worry less about\npopularity and more about taking action on cutting emissions.\nBest freebies from Ecobuild\nconference: an ash sapling and\na 2GB USB stick made from\nrecycled plastic.\nlives into reality.\nPresent will be Sachin Duggal\n(Nivio) and Oliver Woolley (BBAA,\nEnvestors), both Imperial alumni who\nonce took the leap from Science to\nBusiness and are now very successful\nentrepreneurs. The talk is followed by\ndrinks /networking and it\u2019s all free!!\nFor more information see www.\nimperialentrepreneurs.com\n\n"

    "content": "Meat eaters! Kawai Wong is with you\nB\nam. Cow farts. Bam. Global\nwarming. Bam. Acid Rain.\nBam bam bam bam. \u201cYou\nmeat eaters\u201d, a few feeble\nsentences attempted to\npunch us out in last week\u2019s felix. The\narguments played like a skipped record,\n\u201cMeat eaters destroy planet earth.\u201d\nFresh from Tesco: Avocado from Israel. Baby corn from India. String beans\nfrom Kenya. Honeydew from Brazil.\nGalia from Houndras. Kiwi fruit from\nItaly. They all have aeroplane labels on\ntheir packaging. For those who are sensitive enough to smell cow farts: do you\nhave eyes? Can you see the labels?\nIf food miles were taken into con-sideration, the eco warriors would be\ngorging on a lot of British winter veg.\nCarrots, potatoes, mushrooms and on-ions. If a person could fart like a cow,\nglobal warming would no longer be an\nissue with this diet. One could show up\nat British Gas and offer their gas as a\ngreen alternative.\nSome fruit and veg are available\non the supermarkets shelves all year\nround. These pears, apples and grapes\nhave been stored in refrigerated vaults\nfor years since the day they got picked\nin a distant farmland. What is a fridge\nplugged into? The mains. What coolants do fridges use? Ammonia and\npropane. Where do you think the offseason tomatoes and cucumbers come\nfrom? Air conditioned and carbonated\ngreen houses.\nUnless one is a vegan and a nun,\nthere will be chocolates, cheese, milk,\nwine, spirits and ice cream on the\nmenu. Cheese is one of the most energy inefficient foods due to the energy\nthat go into processing and refrigerating it. A bar of Cadbury chocolate has\none and a half glass of milk in it. I believe the milk comes from cows, a type\nof animal that farts.\nDropping facts and guilt bombs is\neasy. A recent study revealed that a\n330ml can of coke embodies 39g less\ncarbon dioxide than a 250ml innocent\nsmoothie, which has a carbon footprint\nof 209g. How ironic that the innocent\nsmoothie has always been perceived as\nthe green drink?\nFlushing your toilet uses an equivalent of 1200 bottled water per month.\nAnd don\u2019t forget that one sixth of the\nworld\u2019s population do not have access\nto clean water. Your Ipod uses bromi-nated glass amongst many other toxic\nchemicals. Upon disposal, the Ipod will\ncertainly mark a skull on the ground.\nIs it likely that you will stop drinking coke? Is it likely that you will stop\nflushing the toilet? Is it likely that you\nwill never, ever buy an Ipod or a com-puter? How much freedom are you\nwilling to sacrifice for the numerous\ngreen agendas out there? The truth\nis that the green arguments are often\nso grey that you can\u2019t distinguish the\nblack and the white. And there often\ntwo sides to it. If you fact and number\ncrunch all the lifestyle guidelines they\nthrow at you, you may as well go back\nto live in the 1800s. It is therefore important to weigh up what you hear\nwith common sense.\nSo is the 200g of meat I am not eating tonight going to save enough water\nand preserve enough land to make the\nworld a better place straight away? But\nif everybody in the UK stopped eating meat for three months, this would\nsurely sabotage the livelihoods of the\nmeat farmers and their families. And\nthis will happen almost right away. Furthermore, how many cows do I have to\nstop eating before the environmental\nchanges take effect? 5? 10? 1000?\nConsidering the ostensible carbon\nfootprint of foodstuff is an elementary\nentry to eco-issues. Nutritional value\nper carbon footprint is the measure\nforward . For the same weight of beef\nbeing carried the same distance as\nbaby corns, the beef cargo contains\nsignificantly higher calorific value and\nmore essential nutrients. This implies\nthat for the same amount of carbon\nfootprint, the meat can satisfy more\nhungry stomachs. Yes, rearing animals\nuses more land. But remember your\nGCSE geography lessons about crop\nrotation? Different crops that have dissimilar nutrient demands are planted\nin sequential seasons for improvement\nof soil structure and fertility. Letting\nthe animals roam around pooping can\nrejuvenate the fertility of the field too.\nIt is undoubtedly shallow to restrict\nour vision to global warming and global warming only. It is of critical importance to realise the many problems\nthat food raise and cure. Yes, the string\nbeans have travelled 4000 miles from\nKenya. But these are grown by farmers whose families\u2019 livelihoods are dependent upon. If consumers were encouraged to look at carbon footprints\nonly, these beans would have no buyer\nwhatsoever.\nNo job for the farmer means no food.\nNot, no plasma TV or no summer holiday in Spain. Their children will end\nup on the front cover of National Geographic so that us kids in the rich world\ncan lament the plight of these poor African children in pure hypocrisy.\nAs a fully conscientious eater, many\notherattributesofafoodproductshould\ngo into consideration. Helping of the\npoor farmers, careful farming methods\nthat nurture the soil, welfare of the ani-mals, ethics of the company are all but\nto name a few. Innocent, for example,\ndonates 10% of profits to charity.\nThe first and foremost decision\nwhen it comes to following a green\nagenda is - how is this lifestyle change\ngoing to affect the living conditions\nof the others? This is a bit controversial - but I believe that any agenda\nthat compromises human rights is a\nrubbish agenda wrapped in glossy pa-per. Some people wish that artificial\nfertilisers never existed because they\nlead to algae boom. Quite easy for an\nall-things-organic mum who drives a\nBMW 5 series to say. It also goes back\nto the careful farming method I mentioned before.\nWhile the future of the environment\nis in our hands now, we should not be\nflooded with guilt every time we enjoy\nthe fruits of the technological advancement that our ancestor toiled to bring\nforward. Stinking your toilet out because there are people who do not have\naccess to clean water is a ridiculous. Directly investing in scientific research is\nthe efficient way to eradicate our global\nwarming problem. In-in-in-in-indirectly curbing your steak cravings is not.\nProtein will always be stocked in my\nfridge. No amount of cow farts, sheep\npoos or bull diarrhoea will be able to\ngreen wash me away from living in\nmoderation.\nA\ns ever, my daily packet of\nenergy gained from my\ndaily Library Caf\u00e9 baked\npotato was in danger of\nrunning out this one Friday afternoon. This packet of energy,\nnot entirely supported by a mediocre\nfour hours of sleep the night before,\nwould hopefully be enough to sustain the thankfully repetitive forward\nmovements of my legs back home. It\nhad been one of those weeks where\nmy time was divided between labs, lab\nreports, dissertations, and extremely\nslight slivers of sleep.\nNot in the mood for niceties or any\nsort of visual emotion, I was nothing\nmore than skin sack full of lazily-func-tioning organs as I walked through the\nmasses of white-collared workers.\nThen, amongst the suits, a homeless man stopped me in my tracks\nand asked those ever-awkward words:\n\u201cBig Issue, mate?\u201d I was thrust into a\nsplit-second moral dilemma; I should\nactually buy it to help the guy out that\nDan Wan gets held up by a convincing tramp\n\u201cThis man could\nhave convinced\nDarwin to set fire\nto the Origin of\nSpecies and eat the\ncharred remains\nfor dinner.\u201d\ntiny bit. However, you naturally question what\u2019s actually beyond the front\ncover adorning Katy Perry. Is it going\nto be of any interest to you, or are you\njust wasting money you, quite frankly,\nneed. But is it actually wasting money\nif it\u2019s contributing to a good deed?\nMental panic ensues, and you hesitate\nslightly as more of these questions soar\nthrough your mind. Normally this hesitation just makes the entire situation\neven more awkward when you finally\nsummon the words \u201cno thanks\u201d from\nyour porridge of a brain.\nThe Big Issue seller pounced on my\nhesitation instead and went onto question why I wasn\u2019t willing to buy The Big\nIssue. He worked the sympathy vote\nwith his personal sob story, and he did\nwell to pull on the strings of my heart\nthat was otherwise barely beating itself\nat this stage of my tiresome day.\nWith instant unconsciousness seeming ever-appealing I was still not entirely comfortable with this unusual and\nabrasive method of selling me a copy\nof the Big Issue. However, there was\nsomething that compelled me about\nthis man worryingly dressed in a coat\nand hat not too dissimilar to mine. He\nseemed incredibly intelligent, and had\nthe ability to reply to my tired slurring\ninstantly and even convincingly.\nThis man could have convinced Darwin\nthatevolutionwaswrong.Imean,hecould\nhave probably gone onto to convince Darwin to set alight to the Origin of Species\nand eat the charred remains for dinner.\nSo, there I stood, in the middle of Fulham Broadway, talking to this tramp.\nAlthough, it was more so him talking\nto me. As his sharp voice continued\nto precisely pierce every passing ear\nwithin a two metre radius, he began to\ntalk about his life at university. \u201cI went\nto Imperial College, just up the road.\nUsed to live in South Kensington I did,\u201d\nhe mentioned proudly, \u201cbut now I lived\nhere in Fulham ever since.\u201d I perked\nup. This oddly echoed the last year and\na half of my own life.\nThis man had a degree from Imperial. Though an obvious but naively\nconclusive question, it would be foolish to reason how he could have possibly ended up living on the streets of\nFulham when he had a degree from a\n\u2018world-class institution\u2019.\nThe more he spoke of Imperial, the\nmore I gauged of his experience. It became more and more of hindsight to\nmy own experiences here at Imperial.\nHe said this place gave him some of\nthe most \u201dfocused\u201d years of his life. He\ndedicated his time to his degree, and\nnothing much else. Through this, Imperial set him up for a life of comfort\nand relative wealth. After he graduated\nwith 2nd class honours, he had a job\nin the City, and looked to have the rest\nof his career on track. However, the recession in 1980 hit him hard. He was\nsubject to the ruthless \u201cfirst in, first\nout\u201d policy at the company he worked\nfor.\nAs much as a degree can do for\nyou, and especially one from a university such as Imperial College, this\nman showed me there is definitely a\nlot more to life. No matter how many\ncushions we have to sit on, there is always the uncomfortable stark surface\nwe are using the cushions to avoid. He\nonly had one cushion, his degree.\nIt is unlikely anyone has the sole focus as their degree in their life. It made\nme realise that when I made the excuse\n\u201cI\u2019m too busy with coursework to talk\u201d, I\nprobably wasn\u2019t. This week, my priorities shifted. My degree is still number\none, but it is parallel with everything\nelse. Your mother and every \u2018career\nadvisor\u2019 you\u2019ve ever spoken to has\nprobably told you to find that healthy\nbalance between work and play, but\nat such a work-intensive university, it\nis so easy to lose it. Most of the time\nthough, the balance comes naturally.\nThe times when it doesn\u2019t are the times\nI\u2019ll think back to The Big Issue seller\u2019s\nstory and reassess.\nAll work and no play makes Dan an\nincredibly tired, and apparently tramp-harassed, boy\u2026..and repeat.\n\u201cIt is of critical\nimportance to\nrealise the many\nproblems that food\nraise and cure\u201d\nAmin Elmubarak examines women\u2019s rights\nT\nhe passion and crafty innovation brought on by\nthe new wave of elections\nat Imperial have flung my\nmind to other important\npolitical issues of the past: apartheid,\ngay rights, and women\u2019s rights. It\u2019s\nthis last issue that I have found myself\ndwelling over for a rather long time as\nI am wondering if women\u2019s rights have\nprogressed in very much since the\nsuffragettes and the mid-nineteenth\ncentury.\nFor many years the ability to vote was\nrestricted to wealthy property owners\nwithin Britain, therefore specifically\nexcluding women, as property law and\nmarriage law gave males ownership\nrights at marriage or inheritance until\nthe 19th century. As difficult as it may\nbe for some to believe, by the 7th century reforms under Islam gave women\nrights in inheritance, marriage and divorce \u2013 the likes of which are yet to be\nseen in some cultures and were yet to\nbe seen in the civilized west for many\ncenturies.\nNow, the laws and legislations of the\nwest seem to have overtaken the early\nattempts of Islamic reform. Though\nthere are many laws and bills that \u201cinsure\u201d equality in terms of employment,\npay and treatment in the work force;\nwomen are still paid, on average, less\nthan men and there are fewer women\nthan men who hold the top jobs in any\nsector.\nSO?\nWhy could this still be an issue after all of these campaigns and laws? It\ncould be that by the time women get\nthe point where a \u201ctop-level\u201d job is\nwithin their grasp, they decide to have\nchildren or the new job could mean\nless time spent with the children that\nthey already managed to have.\nBut the real question is why do we\nalways end up coming back to jobs,\nflexible hours and childcare every time\nwe talk about women\u2019s rights; when\noriginally the issue was equal rights\nof voting and weight within the law ie.\nGiving evidence.\nThese days it seems that there is a\nnew wave of women who opt to settle down, have children and take care\nof them in a manner that is closer to\nwhat their predecessors worked so\nhard in order for them not to. And\nthis wave is seen by the more career-minded as sell-outs or backward, akin\nto how \u201cGangstas\u201d see those of colour\nwho chose to wear chinos and a shirt\nas sell-outs.\nIn my opinion those persecutors have\nbecome what they have been trying so\nhard to fight. The point of all human\nrights movements was not to carve a\nway out for \u201ctheir people to live\u201d but\nto provide an alternative option; to\ngive them the right to chose how they\nwish to live their life \u2013 be it a careers\nclimbing the corporate ladder, flying\nthrough chambers or looking after 3\nlittle children and an even more difficult to please adult one too.\nThe second point and somewhat\nmore pertinent is the idea of value.\nThe value something is given depends\nvery heavily on the criteria you chose\nto value it by; a diamond would fail in\nits evaluation if you used the criteria\nfor grading football striker to grade it.\nLikewise, the problem we have is that\nwe use money as our national and international grading system. To chose\nwhat job we take, what thing to buy (it\nfits in those examples!) but also who to\nvalue? Who brings more to a relation-ship? Who to marry?\nFor men and women to have equal\nrights and equal value, the DO NOT\nneed to be able to do the same jobs or\nwear the same clothes or even \u2013 dare I\nsay- get paid the same!\nLet us start by not calling a girl who\nmight have slept with a few guys on\nfresher\u2019s week a slag or a slut and then\nin the same breath call a guy who did\nthe same a stud!\nLet us start by valuing a woman for\nthe content of her character and her\nviews on issues as oppose to how short\nshe can wear a skirt.\nLet us start by allowing our women\nto have the freedom to choose leaving\nher job to look after her children and\nreturn when she\u2019s ready without being\njudged.\nMan and woman\u2019s existence depends\non one another. Their value is not in\ntheir ability to do the same thing but in\ntheir ability to do for one what the other cannot do for them. When I hammer a nail on to a wall, my left hand\nholds the nail in place whilst my right\nhammers it into place.\nThey may both do different jobs but\nthe are equally as important in carrying out the task.\n\u201cThere are still\nfewer women than\nmen who hold the\ntop jobs in many\nsectors\u201d\nA\nclose friend of mine is\nafflicted with a disease;\nhe caught it in SouthEast Asia. It\u2019s not life-threatening but I\u2019m quite\nconcerned that it might destroy his\nbank account. It\u2019s an affliction shared\nby Travel Editor Dylan Lowe and no\ndoubt a great deal of students at Imperial. It is in fact fairly common: this\ndisease is the need to throw oneself out\nof the aeroplane of comfortable living\nand out into the great blue unknown of\nthe world (usually landing safely with\nthe help of a parental parachute).\nI confess that I too suffer from this\ndisease (thankfully I didn\u2019t need to piss\ninto a cup at the Union to find out)\nbut it isn\u2019t the thrill of experiencing a\nnew food or seeing a new sunset that\ndraws me. Glaciers are less impressive\nthan the gems that humanity tosses up\nand temples and shrines offer less spiritual comfort than the joy of instantly\nconnecting with a person that has no\nknowledge of what you did in the last\nhour \u2013 never mind the 19 years of social baggage that burdens you.\nSo I travel to meet people. I imagine\nthat I would still meet new people at\nhomeifinsteadofpioneeringflight(and\nby a tenuous link sparking a debate in\nthe felix Comment section about Ryanair) the Wright Brothers had decided\nto direct their efforts towards the electric toothbrush but there\u2019s a distinct\nand important difference.\nThere\u2019s an understanding between\ntwo people who meet while travelling\nthat their time together will be brief.\nIt\u2019s not a horror that is considered\ndirectly and explicitly addressed but\nsubconsciously because each passing\nmoment ticks down the clock, each\nmoment also becomes precious. You\nmentally rush towards each other; exposing your secrets in a completely unreasonable spring clean of your emo-tions, learning more about each other\nthan you even knew about yourself and\nno matter how exciting or exhilarating\nthe activities on offer, you know guiltily\nthat you\u2019d be just as satisfied to see no\nmore than the four walls of the inside\nof a bar with your new friend.\nInevitably the dreaded day of departure arrives and the question hangs\nover the platitudes of the goodbyes:\nWill we really make an effort to stay in\ntouch? Our everyday lives can easily\nhijack any idealistic efforts to maintain\nthat special intense holiday bond when\nit loses its intensity (not to mention its\n\u2018holidayness\u2019) and becomes no more\nspecial than a few sentences typed\nmindlessly into facebook. Indeed, is\nthe short lifespan of the friendship\nwhat makes it so sweet?\nIn an attempt to deny the previous\naccusation I have tried to maintain a\nmeaningful contact with a Texas girl\nthat I met during my trip to Washington for Obama\u2019s Inauguration. I have\ntaken inspiration from the Amish and\nrejected modern instant communica-tion. Why give any thought to a facebook message or email when you can\ncorrect, delete and review and if necessary send more messages instantly at\nno cost? The words and sentences are\ncheapened by their ease.\nSo I have shunned the instant gravitation of facebook and instead opted\nfor the slow, thoughtful restraint of the\nletter; leave the alcopops at the door,\nI\u2019ll wait for the mulled wine to finish\nsimmering because, the handwritten\nletter I declare will preserve short-lived\nflash in the pan friendships. That you\nknow nothing of your letter\u2019s progress\nand less so of the letter winging its way\nto you increases the anticipation and\nthe importance of the correspondence,\nwhile on holiday the shortness of time\nadded value, now the slow passing of\ndays without mail gives the connection\nimportance. If nothing else, the great\nlength of time that it takes to receive\nand write a letter, will give me longer\nbefore I run out of things to say.\nTurns out that there\u2019s a reason why\npeople don\u2019t write letters anymore. My\nidealistic epistolary crusade has ended\nin heartbreak. At first, all seemed well.\nI didn\u2019t use your average everyday lined\npaper, I sought out some special letter\nwriting paper. I positively skipped to\nthe post office at Gloucester Road and\nwith a beaming smile I carefully placed\nit into the red box. And I waited... and\nI waited\u2026 for four weeks\u2026 And then\nhurrah! There in the mail to my apartment building, a hand-written letter\nfrom San Antonio, Texas. A victory\nover facebook, email and the best efforts of modern technology to keep\nus instantly connected. And with the\nglory of my success behind me, I wrote\na reply (I even used an ink pen, no, no a\nbiro would not do!).\nIt\u2019s true that pride comes before a\nfall \u2013 I have not yet received a reply.\nEach morning I dare a glance at the\nmailbox but each morning I am sorely\ndisappointed. I\u2019ve considered throwing my hands up and surrending with\na grovelling instant message inquiring\n\u201cdid you get my letter?\u201d but I still convince myself that if I wait one more day,\nI\u2019ll find some literary gold lying on my\ndoorstep.\nI don\u2019t like to say it, but it might be\nmore likely that only one of us was\nkeen to keep in touch. Perhaps memory is enough for my fellow traveller and\njust perhaps some people have better\nthings to do than write to randomers\nfrom London.\nAll I want to know is, is it too desperate to send another letter?\nKadhim Shubber desperately needs a reply. Now!\n\u201cTurns out that\nthere\u2019s a reason\nwhy people don\u2019t\nwrite letters.

    "content": "22 felix Friday 13 March 2009\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTechnology\nTechnology Editor \u2013 Richard Lai\nRichard Lai\nTechnology Editor\nA\nfew weeks ago I promised to try out Windows\n7 on a netbook (Acer Aspire One), but sadly this\nnever happened. In fact,\nbefore I started writing this column I\nwas at the Post Office to return the said\nnetbook back to its eBay seller.\nAll this fuss started back in early February when I won an eBay auction for\nthe faulty netbook: all the seller said\nwas that the screen didn\u2019t turn on, so\nI assumed it would be an easy fix by\nupgrading the BIOS (as suggested by\nmy good friend, Google). What actually let me down was that the seller\ntook pretty much forever to send the\nitem to me, coming up with all sorts\nof excuses: heavy snow for the first\nweek (fair enough), then in the second\nweek he needed to get the shop to extract personal data from the hard disk\n(should have done that before the auction ended!). In fact it was the fourth\nweek when the seller finally shipped\nthe netbook, but my joy was short-lived: upon booting I discovered that\nthe screen was cracked.\nNaturally, I had some suspicion that\nmaybe this was a dark fact that the seller covered up in the auction listing but\non the other hand it could have been\nRoyal Mail\u2019s fault. Anyhow, I contacted\nthe seller to see if I could get some sort\nof refund: \u00a370, which is the standard\nrate for a new screen on eBay, or a full\nrefund if I return the netbook. At this\npoint I must point out that the refund\nrequest is reasonable: I\u2019d be happy to\nclaim the compensation from Royal\nMail myself, but the problem is that\nthe applicant must be the holder of the\nproof of delivery \u2013 that was the seller\nin this case.\nThe seller\u2019s initial responses were\ndisappointing: he claimed that he had\ncontacted Royal Mail but was told that\nthey were \u201cnot too sure what they could\ndo\u201d. Not good enough. In fact, the seller\u2019s claim sounds more like a steaming pile of something that he collected\nfrom the park, and by ignoring my emails since then made it obvious that\nhe wasn\u2019t willing to do anything about\nthis, so I filed a dispute with PayPal.\nThe process goes like this: you file a\ndispute in order to get eBay\u2019s attention,\nwho will assist you to deal with your\ncounterpart if requested; you escalate\nthe dispute to a claim in order to get\nPayPal\u2019s attention, who will actively\ncontact your counterpart to get an an-swer. In my case, I heard nothing from\nthe seller a week after the dispute was\nfiled, so I escalated it to a claim.\nAs the title suggests, PayPal managed to get the seller to speak to them,\nand eventually decided that I was eligible for a full refund (including postage)\nupon returning the item via tracked\ndelivery. They won\u2019t be whipping the\nseller for me, but at least I get all my\nmoney back. Isn\u2019t that great?\nBe warned though: had the seller\nnot sent the item to me via tracked de-livery, PayPal would not have given a\nshit about this, so always double-check\nwhen buying from or selling on eBay.\nFinally, don\u2019t forget to pick up the\nnew issue of Another Castle!\nPayPal FTW!\nCreate your style\nSpecial Introductory Offer\n\u00a323 only\nfor medium devices\n\u00a345 only\nfor large devices\nHow to qualify:\nChoose a design from\n1. www.myDIGISKINdesign.com or use\nyour own high resolution picture\nSend your order (inc. device type) to\n2. sales.uk@mydigiskin.\ncom for an invoice (pay by debit card, credit card or PayPal)\nOnce payment is received, pop down to the\n3.

It\u2019ll most likely be a house\nas there are five of us living under one\nroof. Now unless we wanted to share\nrooms in a confined space such as the\nimmigrants that share small sheds in\nthe back gardens of Slough, a house is a\ngood option. Only problem is, we need\nto find a 5 bedroom house now. Anywho, point is we got off our arses and\nhad a house meeting. It was a nervous\naffair, as we have never had a house\nmeeting before, and as this was our\nfirst one, we had no clue about what\nwe wanted.\nLet me deviate here and tell you a\nfew things. That comment about the\npeople of Slough is true. Trust me, I\nwas brought up there. Also let me tell\nyou now, my house next year with the\npeople I will live with (and I love these\nguys) will be the most dysfunctional\nhouse ever. Everyone in it is a complete\nwaster.\nWell after much discussion and long\ndeliberation, we came out with a few\ngood conclusions, important when\ndeciding things for your new house/\nRavi Pall\nCoffee Break Editor\nflat. The most important one in my\nbook was the fact we are going to get\na dog! For real, loads of people say they\nare going to get a pet of some kind. We\nhave agreed and in fact planned out the\nway to ascertain our dog.\nWhat may be important to others\ninclude; the price your willing to pay,\nlocation, local amenities and comforts\nfor the house hold. In our case I think\nwe want a house somewhere in Fulham,\nnear Fulham Broadway, at aproximately \u00a3170 a week per person including expenses such a phone, gas and electric-ity. And of course SKY+!!! You can get\na pretty decent all in one package from\nthem which includes SKY, Broadband\nand phone.

Oy!\u201d\nO\nne of the unparalleled\npleasures of adulthood,\nwhich almost makes the\nwhole tiresome business\nof growing up worth-while, is the conquering of language.\nFor those of you reading this, adults and\nprecocious toddlers alike, my words\ncannot withhold their secrets. Your\nsteely eyes can force even the most\nlabyrinthine of my sentences to give up\ntheir hidden treasures, in the same way\nas marauding Vikings were wont to do\nto Anglo-Saxon monasteries.\nIf there is something we want to say, we\nhave all 26 letters and 15 formal punctuation marks of the common QWERTY\nkeyboardwithwhichtosayit.Wecanuse\nthe full panoply of verb tenses, cases of\nthe infinitive, subjective and conjunctivi-tis, use the full palette of iambs, trochees,\nterabrachs and anapaests, all the while\nindulging in as many variations of rhyme\npatterns as our hearts desire.\nWe can all communicate whenever\nand wherever we want to, at whichever\nlevel we choose. The horrific image of\nlosing the ability to interact with the\noutside world is now for the most part\nrelegated to the world of nightmares,\nalong with neverending staircases,\ndeformed arachnids and, in my case,\nlarge bears replacing the regular buses\ndriving down Baker Street.\nThis is, of course, true for those of us\nwho are fluent in a particular language.\nWhile my English may well be good\nenough for me to occasionally understand the things I write myself, the\nweaknesses of my other tongues are\na source of constant frustration. My\ngrandparents and older sisters have\nlong grown accustomed to my peculiar\nfondness for the wrong adjectival endings and complete ignorance of grade\nschool conjugation. My nieces, how-ever, in the golden-hearted innocence\nof childhood, are less tolerant. My eldest niece has just turned 12 and so has\nbeen able to speak more coherently\nthan I for most of the past decade.\nTo give her credit, when she realized my imperfections she recovered\nfrom the blow fairly well. Though her\nmother has doubtless taken her aside\nand gently explained why Uncle Gilead\ntalks like he was dropped on his head\nas a baby, my niece\u2019s disbelief still occasionally bubbles to the surface. Forming sentences that contain the requisite\nsubject:object ratio is difficult enough\nwithout watching a 12-year old roll her\neyes as she attempts to hide the smile\non her face. Nor is the sidelong pitying\nglance much of a morale-booster. My\none consolation with this branch of the\nfamily is that I completely crushed her\n3-year old brother at a game of Scrabble the last time we played.\nIt is this sort of inferiority that always\nstrikes me whenever I am confronted\nwith a musical instrument or a sheet of\npaper with staves on. It is irritating and\nhumiliating for an adult to find himself\nunable to communicate in one medium\nwith the fluency he is accustomed to in\nanother. This, by the way, serves as the\nlead-in for those of you who had better\nthings to do last week than pick up a\ncopy of felix and give my 923 words the\nonce-over. It would have killed you to\nat least skim it? Oy!\nWhen faced with the shining ivories\nof a keyboard, for instance, I can come\nclose to understanding the rapine\nthoughts of those Vikings of paragraph\n1. \u2018Olaf see something beautiful. Olaf\nnot able to have it. Only way for Olaf\nto truly own is to destroy.\u2019 Hence why\nevery short-lived keyboard session of\nmine has always ended with violent\nten-fingered thundering \u2013 the last attempt of a desperate man to produce\nsomething beautiful from an object he\nis too uncivilized to truly possess.\nBy far the most beautiful and inaccessible instrument for me, however,\nhas always been the violin. I don\u2019t\nknow whether it is my Jewish cultural\nheritage or an unusual (perhaps even\na usual?) preference, but the sounds\nof the violin resonate more powerfully within me than those of any other\ninstrument. If I hear the sound of a\nfiddle, whether it be of a young child\npracticing at home as I walk down the\nstreet or a busker at my local tube stop,\nI will automatically stop to listen.\nThis is why, gentle readers, to cut\nthrough this most turgid of suspenses\nand let the strangled cat out of the bag, I\nhave decided to take up the violin. It may\nbe foolhardy to announce this in public,\nas my stamina could give up soon and\nleave me with slowly cooking egg on my\nsizzling red face, but I believe I can do it.\nI\u2019m glad that I at least have this modicum of self-confidence or I would never even have had the courage to rent an\ninstrument or contact a teacher. Even\nnow, walking around college with the\ndistinctively-shaped blue case I feel like\nI am somehow cheating. As though I\ndon\u2019t belong in the world of music and\nshould stop faking my membership. If\na real musician were to come over to\nme and shake his head in disappoint-ment, I would not think twice before\nhanding over my violin and running\nbehind the building to cry.\nMy short journeys from the locker\nwhere I store my instrument to the\ncrowded music rooms are made by\npassing through as many shadows as\npossible and by employing the most\ndeserted routes I know.\nIf you should knock on the door\nof one of the aforementioned music\nrooms and hear the yelp of a dying\nanimal, the odds are 50-50 that it will\nbe me, and not my violin. And if you\nshould walk in, you will find me cowering behind the chair in the hope you\nwon\u2019t register a complaint about how\nsomeone like me got inside.\nS\no Sir Roy Anderson says that\nhe wants UK students to pay\ntwo or three times the current rate for their education.\nPersonally, I don\u2019t see the\nproblem with that as there are now\nthousands of students leaving universities with degrees that aren\u2019t worth the\npaper they\u2019re written on and are struggling to find jobs. Many of them simply took the university route because\nit meant not working for another three\nto four years and now that decision has\ncome back to bite them. Maybe the\nincrease in tuition fees will make only\nthose who are serious about their degree do them in the first place.\nIn my time, I have already seen an\nincrease in tuition fees and have seen\npeople argue the points for and against\nhaving them increased in the first\nplace. I must admit though, that it was\nMustapher Botchway, the sports editor,\nwho pointed this out to me, but with\nthe increase in tuition fees there has\nalso been a shift in social behaviour.\nLet\u2019s face it, compared to the other\nuniversities in London, we are the ones\nwho are seen as the geeks.\nWhen he told me of his little hypoth-esis, I had a good look back at my four\nand a bit years here at Imperial and to\nmy surprise, he was right. In our first\nyear we were always busy doing some-thing, either going out to clubs or just\ndown to the pub for a few quiet drinks,\nwe were always doing something. One\nnight that was a compulsory one for\nus, was a Wednesday night in the Union with the rest of the sports teams.\nBack then, if you didn\u2019t come out on a\nWednesday, it was frowned upon and\nas a result Wednesday nights were always busy, even dB\u2019s, at 7pm. Since\nthen, there has been a steady decline in\nthe number of people attending, now\nwhereas some might blame the quality\nof the nights put on, Mustapher blames\nthe rise in tuition fees.\nThe logic behind it is a simple one;\nbecause students now have to pay up\nto \u00a312,000 for a degree compared to\n\u00a34,000 when I started, they constantly\nfeel that they need to get their money\u2019s\nworth and not waste it away in the\nbars and clubs of London. Students are\nfeeling that if they are going to spend\n\u00a312,000 on an education, they can\u2019t\nafford to waste their time and end up\nwith a 2:2 that won\u2019t really get them\npast the online application stage. I have\nseen this mentality first hand, as living\nin halls has exposed the mentality of\nour first year students, and the conclusion is a simple one; they are scared of\ngetting a bad grade and as a result, they\nconstantly seem to be working and as a\nresult, they are less tempted to venture\ninto the great nightlife that London has\nto offer. Relax everyone, it\u2019s your first\nyear, this is meant to be the one that\nyou enjoy and have a good time!!\nWith our already appalling reputation for social life at Imperial, my question is will an increase in tuition fees\nsee the social life at Imperial die out?\nL\nast week there was an opinion expressed by Abdul\nHanan expressed that the\ngovernment was employing\n\u201ctyrannical tactics\u201d \u201caimed\nat blurring and eventually wiping out\nIslamic identity, values and thought.\u201d\nAnd it sounded awful that our evil oppressive society was pushing a minority\naround. But after doing some research\nit\u2019s obvious that there are some pretty\nbig points that need looking at.\nEssentially what\u2019s happened is that\nsome people in Whitehall have put together a draft proposal to ban certain\nbehaviour being promoted in government funded Muslim institutions, so if\nyour Mosque takes government funds\nyou\u2019re not allowed to do certain things.\nAnd from the backlash on the internet\nit seems that there are four big \u201cMuslim\u201d opinions that the state has \u201cno\nright\u201d to ask for changes in. And as\nusual both sides are being absurd.\nThe first Big Thing is that the government finds it wrong for Muslims\nto call for a Caliphate (a big worldwide state where everyone is Muslim\nand governed by Shariah law) and\nthe idea is that if Muslims don\u2019t want\na Caliphate then they won\u2019t turn to\narmed struggle. This is patently gib-berish. Muslims should have the same\nfreedom to express a utopian view as\neveryone else \u2013 so long as they respect\neveryone else\u2019s right to do so. Muslims\nshould have as much right to call for a\nCaliphate as I have to call for a world\nin which Islam is no longer practiced;\neveryone is a humanist and the writings of religion sit on par with fairy\ntales. Free speech flows both ways, if\nindividuals accept that, then there is\nno reason they should not be allowed\nto say what they want.\nThe belief in jihad, or armed resist-ance, is also an issue and the government paper points out that government funded institutions shouldn\u2019t\ncall for the armed destruction of its\npolitical allies. Of course the government has taken this too far and said\nthat calling for armed resistance by\nPalestinians against the Israeli military\nis unacceptable behaviour from a government funded body. This is insane.\nMuslims in Palestine have just as much\nright to armed defence as the Jews\nacross the border do. If someone fires\nrockets at Israel then Israel has every\nright to fight back. If Israel randomly\nattacks Palestine, then the Palestinians\nhave every right to fight back. Everyone who has ever grown up in a playground understands this.\nThe third big issue is the call from\nsome Muslims for Shariah law. And\nhere the government is right. There is\nno reason that belief in a certain religion should grant you different legal\nrights. There is absolutely no case for\nhaving two parallel legal systems within an equal society. We are all equal\nindividuals of the same nation and we\nshould all be governed by the same set\nof laws, and if we want to change those\nlaws, our democratic system provides\nus with a means to do so. Having two\nlegal systems only accomplishes the\ncreation of second class citizens.\nFinally the government proposal\nwould mean that state funded Muslim\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nWill the social\nlife at Imperial\ndie out?\nI\nmperial College is notorious for\nbeing full of grumpy, depressed\nand downright fucked off students - so much so that they ban\ngoing up Queen\u2019s Tower (except\nin RAG week) so you don\u2019t throw yourself off! Our student satisfaction rating\nin The Times Good University Guide1\n2009 is 38th out of 113, even though\nwe\u2019re 3rd best overall. According to\nUnistats2 2008, the Aero department\nrank themselves a self -deprecating\n22nd out of 26. (Possibly understandable if you associate with Chris O!).\nSo why the long face? It might be just\n\u2018grass is greener\u2019 syndrome, but is\nthere more a deep rooted hatred that is\nspawned by being a cog in the Imperial\nmachine?\nLet\u2019s have a look at the Times League\nTables first. Oddly, Imperial spending 11% more on us than the next best\nUniversity doesn\u2019t mean a jot. Maybe\nif more was spent on departmental\nfunding and less on ludicrously slow\nrevolving doors, oversized pictures of\nthe Rector\u2019s brain and blue tiled buildings maybe we wouldn\u2019t be a big bunch\nof whingers, probably not though.\nWe award a relatively low amount of\n\u2018good\u2019 honours (26/113), although we\ndo have the best graduate prospects.\nThis should fill us with a wondrous\nfeeling of self satisfaction that after\nall the pain comes a pot of gold. But\nthen again, who likes the Sergeant Major who makes you run harder, faster,\nfor longer than anyone is the whole\nbloody army only at the very end to say,\nno, you\u2019re still a mangy maggot who is\nworthless.\nDefinitely some things to think about\nthere but let\u2019s see another company\u2019s\nstatistics, Push.co.uk3 give some of\nThe debate on\ndrugs continues\ninstitutions could no longer declare\nhomosexuality to be a sin and call for\nit to be banned. And while it feels very\ndraconian, it\u2019s the right thing to do. In\nexactly the same way that believing in\nGod from a certain perspective doesn\u2019t\nsuddenly give you different legal rights,\nbeing religious doesn\u2019t magically give\nyou the privilege of robbing other\npeople of their civil rights. If religious\n(the paper would have to apply to all\nreligions) groups want to call for the\nbanning of homosexuality while being\npublically funded then I should be allowed to get public funding to aid me\nin calling for the banning of religion.\nThat\u2019s fair. Until I can get my fund-ing, other people shouldn\u2019t get theirs.\nThere is nothing wrong with being gay.\nHomosexuality occurs widely in na-ture. Homosexuals and heterosexuals\nshould have equal same rights in our\nsociety. And if you don\u2019t like the idea\nof equal rights, then I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re a\nmember of the wrong society.\nAnd before I duck away from the inevitable tide of angry that\u2019s coming my\nway, I just want to say: growing up I (a\nSikh) had to sing Christian hymns at\nschool. It did me, nor my religion any\nharm.\nAnd if kids really don\u2019t want to sing,\nthey can just keep their mouths closed.\nSinging Christian hymns makes a person no more a Christian than eating\nhalal food makes someone Muslim.\nShahadah (love of Allah), Prayer, Zakat\n(charity), Sawm (fasting) and the Hajj\n(pilgrimage) make someone a follower\nof the Prophet, not refusal to accept\nothers way of life.\nLuke Dhanoa: In defense of\n\u201cliberal western values\u201d\nT\nwo weeks ago Edward\nTownes made a very resonant point; that the state\nshould not be allowed to\ninterfere with the free will\nof an individual, particularly if their\ninterference is the criminalisation of a\nvictimless \u2018crime\u2019. This is, essentially, a\ndefinition of freedom.\nHowever, one has to consider exactly what one\u2019s free will is, particularly while suffering from a drug de-pendency. Obviously, it is usually very\nmuch one\u2019s own desire whether or not\nto smoke cannabis and as such the laws\n(and more importantly the enforce-ment) concerning this drug are reasonably light. My opinion would see\nthis, or even full legalisation, extended\nto drugs that can be broadly characterised by very low heavy dependency\nrates, even if they are Class A (take\necstasy as an example). Legalisation\ncampaigners often invoke the figure of\n1.5mil US drugs arrest per year \u2013 DoJ\nfigures show that this re-classification\nwould reduce that by at least 900 000.\nAnd notably these are the drugs (with\nthe exception of cocaine) that are\nusually associated with \u2018inert\u2019 users\n\u2013 those who would not otherwise be\ncriminalised.\nI do find it a lot harder to argue that\nsomeone with a methamphetamine,\ncocaine or heroin dependency is truly\nmaking a voluntary decision every time\nthey take the drug. If they were then\nwhy is it infamously hard to quit?\nOf course the same argument could\nbe applied to alcoholism, however this\nfails to account for the comparatively\nmassive exposure to alcohol that it\ntakes to become addicted, or appreciate the nihilist fallacy of the argument\nthat our society has tolerated one ill for\nso long, we may as well legalise anything similar.\nMy cousin (who attended a prominent public school) ODed on heroin.\nHe was found lying unconscious on\nhis side, in a pool of his own vomit and\nwith the needle still in his arm, by his\nmother. Once taken to hospital, his\nparents were told that he was expected\nto die.\nHe is now out of his coma, but 12\nmonths later he still cannot come\nto terms with what he has done and\nconvinces himself that he was in a car\ncrash. At 28 he is now entirely dependent on his parents and his doctors expect this to be the case for the \u2018next\ncouple of years\u2019. Fortunately his parents\nare in a position to support him both\nfinancially and emotionally, however I\nam sure that there are many with similar stories, but without this luxury.\nFollowing Edward\u2019s argument I do\nnot see how his ideas would have prevented this. Apparently my cousin\ndidn\u2019t take bad stuff, he just took too\nmuch \u2013 a problem that will recur whatever instructions come on the label and\nunless you intend to oversee the taking\nof all drugs legally sold. This is not particularly feasible with drugs like meth\nor coke, or with the atmosphere under\nwhich most people use them. So oversight not only threatens the \u2018freedom\u2019\nargument, but it will again generate a\nblack market; one which licensed companies are going to be under immense\npressure not to supply (wittingly or\notherwise), thus bypassing the regulation of quality.\nSo not only is it almost certain that\npushers and their supply networks\nwill remain in this country (albeit on\na reduced scale), but I doubt that the\ncartels and many parties interested in\nthe global supply of narcotics will give\nup because some of the rich world le-galises. Ironically, the more successful\nlegalisation is in the West, the less of\nan interest to western governments the\nglobal narcotics networks will be, in\nshort cutting support from the greatest suppliers of funding, equipment\nand training to combat narcotics.\nIn search of new revenue sources the\ncartels would undoubtedly focus on\nsales in poorer states, those less well\nequipped to combat either the power\nof the cartels (as Edward points out,\nboth political and paramilitary) but\nalso the social and rehabilitation costs\nof a growing drugs market. While\nmany poor nations already have severe\nproblems of this kind, I maintain that\nthe cartels will increase their focus on\nthese and other nations \u2013 ultimately\nwherever they think they will be most\nsuccessful.\nThe reply to this is that the west\nshould maintain funding levels and increase co-operation with these states\nas the problem spreads \u2013 but aside\nfrom the truly unmanageable logistics\nand diplomacy of any such operation,\nit seems that it would violate one of\nthe key motivators for legalisation, in\nthat any effective policy would at some\npoint violate sovereignty of some if not\nmany of the states at which aid was\ntargeted.\nThe \u2018war on drugs\u2019 is bloody, but it is\na war. The Economist this week quotes\nthe blood-spill this year in Mexico as\na reason to legalise, but a matter of\nmonths ago the same magazine was\nexplaining that President Caulderon\nis engaging in a \u2018push\u2019 to finally cripple\nthe more social based statistics for\nuniversities.\nMaybe the impetuousness of our\nyouthful college (in terms of mature\nstudents we are 137/138) striving to\nchange the world for the better combined with the sudden knock-back\nof hard work destroys our hopes and\ndreams. This is encapsulated by the institution that dashed the boats that are\nour minds which believed that I, Imperial student would excel and become\nthe next De La Beche/Brunel/Darwin\nor Pasteur (delete where applicable)\nagainst the rocks of the reality that\n8000 people cannot all be great.\nI\u2019m sure the extreme right wing society would argue that it\u2019s the 39% of\ninternational students stealing our\nsatisfaction with their Queensgate\nresidences and they being used to the\nhumidity level in the library leading to\nWhere do we draw the line?\nTim Harford-Cross can solve Imperial\u2019s poor student satisfaction rating\nthe Mexican cartels. It would be naive\nto think that this would not be bloody,\nor that there would be risk to the state\nitself as reflected in the opinions of\nmany think tanks. However, western legalisation or not, the destruction of the cartels will still have to be\nundertaken.\nIn short, while I recognise that there\nare serious arguments for the legalisa-tion of narcotics, the nature of the sup-plynetworkwouldrequireanyactionto\nbe global in scale and this itself brings\nabout a maze of enforcement issues.\nFull legalisation would perhaps have\nbeen an argument before the problem\nbecame so global (\u2018opium wars\u2019 bring\nperspective as to how far back we\nwould have to look), but it does little to\naddress a paramilitary supply network\nalready in place.\nThe sad truth is that while I do not\nsee many of the evils associated with\nit successfully being combated in the\nnext couple of decades, at the moment\nmuch of the sales market is focussed\nin the countries who seem most able\nto deal with such an international and\nresource draining crime.\nthem always doing better in exams is\nthe root of the dissatisfaction.\nAnd with even less doubt I think that\nthe extreme left wing society would\ncounter by saying it is the unnaturally\nlow level of state school students (6th\nlowest) and treatment of the ethnic\nsocieties(cue the Islamic society being\nexiled to Queen\u2019s Lawn) strikes a feeling of an elitist police state, driven by\nthe capitalised institutions who break\nour morale and force the good hard\nworking people of this college into a\nuniform number-crunching efficient\nmachine, that live in a pseudo-free so-ciety, where life is not chosen but directed by an authoritarian leader who\u2019s\nwhims and personal preferences are\nlaw only superseded by decisions that\nlead to greater profit, defeat the natural sense of satisfaction one gets from\nachievement.\nBut if we remove the extremists, the\npessimists, the optimists, the young,\nthe old, the capitalists, the socialists\nand all heirs to the throne, we should\nend up with a beautifully average person who is happily content yet for some\nreason their immensely pissed off. Can\nwe blame college though? I think not;\nwe chose to come here. We knew that\nRoehampton(24:76) had a male: female\nratio destroying our pitiful 64:36 and\nLeeds Met average rent was less than\nhalf ours (\u00a352 rather than \u00a3111).\nSo if we fancy improving our satisfaction maybe we should get off our\narses and enjoy the surfeit of theatres,\ncinemas, bars, restaurants and celebrities that only Central London has to\noffer and our political, international,\nsports, social and departmental clubs\nthat have some of the best facilities in\nthe land.\n\u201cIf we fancy\nimproving our\nsatisfaction maybe\nwe should get off\nour arses\u201d\nThe author is anonymous due to\nsensitive content in the article\n\n"

This show\nhas transformed the\nmuseum\u2019s fashion and\ntextile collection into what we know\nit as today. Thanks to the curator for\nthis fashion show, Sir Cecil Beaton \u2013 a\nphotographer for Vanity Fair and the\ncostume designer for the musical My\nFair Lady \u2013 he encouraged the V&A\nto document a full history of fashion.\nV&A\u2019s fashion collection now boasts\nover 28,000 pieces ranging from the\nwedding suit of James II of England up\nto the modern day masterpieces from\ndesigners such as Vivienne Westwood\nand Christian Lacroix.\nV&A compares the legendary 1971\nshow to its current hat exhibition:\nHats - An Anthology by Stephen Jones.\nLikening the implications underlying Cecil and Stephen\u2019s exhibitions\nfor V&A is only one aspect of the designers\u2019 seemingly parallel universe.\nSteven Jones rescued some of Cecil\nBeaton\u2019s work for My Fair Lady which\nwere originally bagged up and ready to\nbe shipped off to a landfill site. After a\ntip-off from stylist L\u2019Wren Scott, Jones\nproceeded to acquire the hats from a\nWarner Brother\u2019s archive in LA.

The exhibition is divided into 4\nsections - the stages of hat making: the\ninspiration, the creation, the salon and\nthe client. The creation section features an installation of a milliner\u2019s at-elier. The workroom is filled with hats\nthat are in different stages of produc-tion. Also on show in the atelier are the\ngenuine \u201chead conformations\u201d of Princess Diana and Jackie Onassis.\nSteven Jones travelled around the\nworld for two years in search of the\n100 hats to add to the exhibition. The\nremainder 200 hats come from within\nthe museum and private collectors.\nThe exhibition draws on pieces from\nthe Egyptian from 600 BC all the way\nup to the two kaleidoscopes like pompom head dresses Bjork wore on stage\n24 felix Friday 13 March 2009\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFashion\nFashion Editor \u2013 Dan Wan\nKawai Wong: What are the inspirations behind these flat pack hats?\nZara: I worked in a commercial environment before I came to study at\nthe RCA. I am aware that large hats are\nnot the easiest objects to be packaged\nand transported. So I was inspired by\nthe notion of a collapsible hat. I was\ninspired to create elaborate hats that\ncan be folded up and don\u2019t take up extra space.\nK: How did you pursue the idea?\nZ: I looked at various patents for\nconstructions that have been created\nin the past. Also how things can be\ncut out. Then I started to look at techniques such as laser cutting etc.\nK: Is this a completely new design?\nZ: This has certainly opened up new\nworld of millinery for me. I am interested in things that are not necessarily\nconstructed from traditional blocks. I\nhave placed a patent in the technical\narea. So I\u2019d like to hope that this is a\ncompletely new area of hat design.\nK: What is your ethos in terms of designing hats?\nZ:Ilikethingsthatlooksimpleandelegant but also based on functionality.\nK: Where are you going from here?\nZ: I am open to all sorts of things at\nthe moment. There are many departments at the RCA and there are always\ntechniques that I can try and trial -vacuum forming, clay modelling and\nlaser cutting. I\u2019ll also experiment with\ndifferent fabrics as well which aren\u2019t\nnecessarily used in traditional milli-nery. And of course I will still develop\nmy flat pack hats.\nK: Are you looking forward to starting your own design label?\nZ: I am actually quite looking forward to working with other designers.\nGraduating from RCA doesn\u2019t mean\nthe end of a learning process. People\ncan evolve and get good aspirations\nby collaborating with other people.\nStephen Jones works with an amazing\narray of fashion designers.\nGoing forward my ambition will be\nto work for another milliner or possibly a couture house rather than on my\nown.\nClockwise from top: Hat 1, Hat\n2, Hat 3. Elegant, simple and\ncollaspesable!\nZara Gorman, from the RCA, has created flatpack hats. Kawai\nWong enquires\n\n"

Imperial College Handball Club\nhad to settle for fifth place in the University Handball Championships, despite impressive performances in the\ngroup stages and words of praise from\nthe British Handball Association.\nOn the dawn of Saturday the 28th of\nFebruary, 9 brave warriors made their\nway to Nottingham in order to attempt\nwhat is believed to be impossible. Disrupt the well established Handball hierarchy in the UK. The 5am wakeup call\nand the training session from the night\nbefore still in our bones, we all man-aged, to get on the train in time. Arriving slightly ahead of schedule, gave\nsome of us the opportunity to discover\nthe limited wonders of Nottingham and\nlocate the nearest pub.\nWestartedoffagainstcombinedGlasgow/Strathclyde, who won the Scottish\nleague title in December and have a\ngood reputation. Our aggressive but\ntiring five-one defence gave Alex Hyun\nopportunities to frequently steal the\nball and interrupt the opponents built-up. In addition to that, some clinical\nfinishing by Arthur Gauriot and Adam\nZwierzinsky helped us claim our first\never victory in a major competition.\nAfter a short break, it was our turn to\nplay title favourites Oxford. We managed to claim the first goal in very tense\nopening moments and shortly after,\nRuben Freytag scored what has to be\nthe goal of the tournament. However,\nOxford got back in the game quickly\nand outran us on the counter attacks to\nclaim a convincing victory.\nWarwick University was up next, despite participating in Division 2, they\nwere unable to win a game so far. We\nwere eager to win and quickly raced to a\n5:0 lead after only a few minutes thanks\nto solid performances from Manuel\nCastro, Ignacio Vazquez and Stefan\nBauer in goal, who saved all 4 penalty\nthrows awarded to Warwick in that\ngame. Warwick however, fought back\nto an 8:8 with only a few seconds to go,\nso that only a fine throw from the wing\nin the last seconds secured us 2 vital\npoints.\nIn the meantime, Oxford surprisingly\ndropped points against Glasgow and\nhas been held to a draw by Nottingham,\nwhich meant that we could go top of\nour group if we beat the host team. Under such pressure, we showed our quality and laboured us to a 6:3 lead with\nThibault Faninger scoring some fine\ngoals. Nottingham, with a lot of routine\nand a bit of luck towards the end of the\ngame, held us to a draw in the closing\nseconds and denied us a place in the\nsemi-finals.\nWe were scheduled to face the third\nplace of the group B, which despite\nhaving defending champions Manchester University in it, turned out to be a\nlot weaker on average. So it was not a\nsurprise that Imperial College Handball\nClub claimed a convincing victory over\nLincoln despite losing one of our central players Tobias Gierk to an injury\nfrom the previous day.\nImperial Handball Club\nmissed semi-finals \u201cby a\nwhisker\u201d!\nStefan Bauer\nIC Hockey unbeaten against\nthe Medicals\nContinued from back page\nImperial Sarah Clayton chasing down the Medicals player\nImperial on the attack at the University Handball Championships\nViking-B\u00f8\u00e5t wins\nn\u00f8vice penn\u00e5nt \u00e5t the\nH\u00e5mmersmith He\u00e5d\nImperial College Boat Club were victorious at Hammersmith Head last\nweekend winning the Novice Pennant by 0.7 seconds ahead of Emanuel\nSchool BC.

The crew\nranked an impressive 40th overall out\nof 90 entrants with Elite 8+ Henley RC\nA taking the overall Head win: only 67\nseconds ahead of the Nordic Novices.\nIC 1 (Sean Delaney, John Beaty,\nRory Fallon, Thomas Walshe, Benjamin Fahs, Patrick Hudson, Andreas\nPr\u00f8sch, Alistair Larsson) were coxed\nby Deepika Reddy in an epic battle of\nthe elements as the clouds opened and\nrain battered down on the crew after\nan initially sunny morning. Weeks of\ngrueling feet-out square-blades training under the command of coach Nick\nAblitt had the crew well conditioned\nfor drenched rowing. The crew fought\nthrough hurricane force winds and\npowered along overtaking four boats:\nExeter University RC (Novice), Kingston/Quintin/TSS (Vet F), Quintin BC\n(Vet E), London RC (Vet F).\nByBarnesBridgeoverheadlightening\nreached unreasonable levels and it was\nlooking likely that the race would have\nto be abandoned. Delayed results later\nfed to the rumours that there would be\nno winners due to the conditions. But\nnot even sleet could deter the IC crew\nand they valiantly powered on. Boat\nPeter Reilly for once held up through\nthe swell with no technical difficulties\nreported and the 8+ cruised home to\nvictory.\nIC B (Sam Reimer, Angelo Tardugno, Chris Kroon, John Nichols, Doru\nProcopiu, James Falkingham, Valerio\nChang, Morris Jones) were coxed by\nKate Wylie and finished in 13:03.87,\n23rd in the novice category (83rd over-Christina Duffy all). After a shaky start the crew settled into a good rate and was pleased\nto make it back to Putney after spending two hours in the elements.

A ball\nwent straight up to Udi Reddy in the D\nwho tipped the ball past the goalkeeper\nleaving the scoreline at 2-1 to Imperial\nat halftime.\nThe Imperial captain, Sarah Clayton,\nset all the Imperial players straight with\nan abusive team talk at half time which\nfrankly scared some of the players. Play\nbegan again and almost immediately\nthe Medicals had a short corner. After\na beautifully worked tick-tock move \u2013\na one-two on the top of the D, the ball\nwas strongly pushed inside the post by\ntheir beloved final year, Jessie Payne, to\nbring the score to 2-2.\nHowever ten minutes of hard work\nfrom both sides resulted in Imperial\u2019s\nVicky scoring another goal, and within\na few minutes she managed to score\nanother to settle the game and giving\nVicky her second hattrick of the sea-son. The Medicals battled to the very\nend but the final whistle ended to give\na 4-2 score line to Imperial.\nThe match was sadly tainted by\nsome contentious umpiring decisions\nthroughout which over-shadowed\ngood play on both sides and made the\nmatch a far less enjoyable occasion\nthan it should have been.\nThe match finished with a proud\nMedics captain due to brilliant play by\neveryone on the team, and an incredibly enjoyable night to look forward to\ndespite the loss.\nCongratulations should go to their\nmost valuable player of the match,\nFiona Laird for some great play in mid-field, both defensively and in attack.\nFrom the Imperial point of, special\nmention goes to Vicky for her sterling\nperformance and hatrick which earned\nher the Man of the Match award.\n\n"

In\nreturn the US would help upgrade Poland and the Czech Republic\u2019s armed\nforces.\nThe proposed system had received support from NATO, which Poland is\na member of, and Poland sees the system as extremely important for its se-curity. But other ex-Soviet states are not so supportive of the idea and there\nare fears the plan has already stoked up an arms race and contributed to a\nnew cold war.\nPoland\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued an arrest warrant for\nSudanese President Omar al-Bashir.\nIt has accused the leader of committing crimes against humanity and war\ncrimes in war-torn Darfur, where more than 300,000 people have lost their\nlives over the past 6 years. The arrest warrant follows on from the indictment \u2013 a formal accusation of committing a crime \u2013 of Bashir in July 2008\nwhich caused a stir as it was the first time a sitting heading of state had been\nindicted.\nIn its arrest warrant the ICC refrained from pressing charges of genocide\ndue to insufficient evidence, but said that it would not hesitate to do so should\nmore evidence emerge. All 108 governments who have ratified the ICC statutes are now obliged to try\nand bring the defiant Mr\nBashir to justice.\nWhether this arrest warrant is a triumph for justice or will bring further\nviolence to Sudan remains\nuncertain. Earlier this\nweek however, UN peacekeepers in Darfur were\nambushed, and four were\nseriously injured by local\nmilitia.\nSudan\nChinese authorities tightened security and restricted\nall tourism in Tibet, as the\nDalai Lama lashed out at his\noppressors, ahead of the 50th\nanniversary of the Chinese\ncrackdown on Tibet.\nThis time of the year always\nhas the police in eastern city of\nLhasa feeling edgy, but this year is particularly important. It is 50 years since\nthe Chinese crushed the Tibetan rebellion, forcing the Dalai Lama into exile;\n20 years since protests which led to the imposition of martial law; and one\nyear since the deadly protests which brought about a backlash by security\nforces in the run up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\nFor all the talk on the Tibetan side, and all the threats from Beijing, the\n10th of March, the day of the 50th anniversary, went by without much inci-dent. But supporters of the Tibetan cause are getting increasingly frustrated\nat the lack of concessions from China, and the so far ineffective tactics of the\nDalai Lama.\nChina\nEngineering libraries to be\nshut down by August\nThe four remaining Engineering Departmental Libraries are to be closed\nfrom the 1st of August this year in\nplans to concentrate services in the\nCentral Library.\nIn an email to the Union, Deborah\nShorley (Director of Library Services)\nsaid that \u201cThe role of Engineering Departments Libraries has diminished\nand they are no longer well used\u201d due\nto the increasing use of electronic resources and the \u201cimproved facilities for\nstudents in the Central Library\u201d.\nThe closures come at a time of increasing budget cuts around campus\nincluding a 5% reduction in the Union\u2019s annual subvention (the money\ngiven to Imperial College Union by the\nCollege). In this environment, \u201cmaintaining a [library] service in each of\nthem [Engineering Departments] does\nnot represent a good use of College\nresources\u201d.\nJob losses as a result of these changes\nare being minimised with efforts being made to redeploy library staff elsewhere in the College. However the only\njobs being guaranteed are Engineering\nLiaison Librarians who will see no\nchange to their responsibilities.\nCity and Guilds College Union\n(CGCU) President Mark MearingSmith was confident that the changes\nwouldn\u2019t impact students negatively\nsaying \u201cThis is a change that could be\ndone smoothly and efficiently with a\nbenefit to students and my successor\nwill be working over the summer to ensure that this is the case\u201d. Deputy President Education and Welfare (DPEW)\nHannah Theodorou was similarly calm\nabout the closures saying \u201cWhile it is\na disappointment to see the libraries\nclose, I can understand the reasons\nbehind the decision and I believe that\nthe library will work closely with the\nFaculty to ensure the Departments affected are able to continue providing\nthe all the required resources through\nthe College\u2019s central library\u201d\nConcerns were raised by both relating to the continued use of the libraries as useful study spaces. In addition\nthe CGCU President was keen to stress\nthat the collections and books in the\nDepartmental Libraries must remain\naccessible saying \u201cWe need to make\nsure that the books and collections\nhoused in the Departmental Libraries\naren\u2019t moved into storage and continue\nto be available to students in the Central Library\u201d\nHowever the College has made no\nguarantee that all the books and collections will be moved to the Central Library saying only that \u201cDecisions about\nwhat should happen to Department\nLibrary collections will be made jointly\nby the Library and the Department,\ntaking into account the security of the\ncollections and long term access\u201d.\nThere is opposition to the planned\nclosures. A petition has been started by\nSenior Lecturer Dr J R Standing from\nthe Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. In an email to the\nCivil Engineering (CivEng) Department\nhe says \u201cMany of us are really enraged\nby the idea - especially as it seems there\nwas no consultation about it\u201d.\nThe petition has already been signed\nby the Head of CivEng Department\nand will be available to sign in the CivEng library until 2pm this afternoon.\nKadhim Shubber\nDeputy Editor\nAnother day, another accolade for Imperial\nCollege\nImperial College has officially become\nthe first Academic Health Science\nCentre (AHSC) in the UK this week.\nAn AHSC is a formally recognized\npartnership between a university and\nhealthcare provider.\nThis acknowledgement comes only\n18 months after Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust and St. Mary\u2019s NHS\nTrust merged under the Imperial College name in October 2007.\nAfter six months of close scrutiny by\nthe Department of Health, Imperial\nCollege London Faculty of Medicine\nand Imperial College Healthcare NHS\nTrust are awarded the first British\nAHSC designation.\nProfessor Stephen Smith is both\nChief Executive of Imperial College\nHealthcare NHS Trust and Principal\nof the Faculty of Medicine at Imperial College London. He feels the joint\ngovernance over Faculty of Medicine\nand the Healthcare NHS Trust has\nhad immediate impact on now \u201cworld\nclass\u201d biomedical research, education\nand patient care.\n\u201cWe have passionately believed in\nthis approach for a long time and today\u2019s announcement confirms our vision for the AHSC which is already\nbringing great benefit to patients.\n\u201cDuring our first 18 months as an\nAHSC, we have achieved the lowest\nstandardised mortality rates in the\ncountry of any multispecialty NHS\nTrust, developed and introduced a new\ntest that can diagnose TB more accurately than ever before and pioneered\nthe use of robotic technology to treat\ncomplex aneurysms, previously considered too high risk to operate on.\nThe benefits for patients could not be\nclearer.\u201d\nWe are delighted to be recognised as\nan AHSC. This approach is recognised\ninternationally as delivering better\nhealthcare outcomes and it is excellent\nnews for local people and the UK as a\nwhole that it has been adopted here.\u201d\nLord Tugendhat, Chairman of ImpeDan Wan\nNews Editor\nrial College Healthcare NHS Trust said\nof the newly formed AHSC. Similar\nAHSC models bringing education and\nhealthcare provision under one source\nof control have proven to be highly effective in countries including the USA,\nCanada and Singapore.\nSir Roy Anderson summed up the\nAHSC as a great step for Imperial\nCollege\u2019s ever-developing academic\nreputation and medical provision: \u201cI\u2019m\ndelighted that our AHSC partnership\nhas been formally recognised by our\ninternational peers for the world-class\nquality of its research, education and\npatient care. Winning formal AHSC\nstatus is testament to the leadership\nand vision of our principal and chief\nexecutive, Professor Stephen Smith,\nand the determination and passion\nof so many people across the AHSC\nwho have worked hard to turn this vision into a reality. We can be proud of\nour successes achieved in the first 18\nmonths, and look forward to making\nmany more advances in healthcare that\nwill directly benefit our patients.\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "Architecture and the art behind it\nEmily Wilson sees the great architect, artist and designer Le Corbusier at the Barbican centre\nT\nhe exhibition space in the\nBarbican centre is a little\nunusual \u2013 it\u2019s big and open\nand spread out across two\nlevels. Architecturally elegant itself, this is the perfect venue to\nhouse the Le Corbusier retrospective.\nIts quirky design complements the\ncontents beautifully, though doesn\u2019t\nlend itself to a sequential walk round.\nIt takes me a while to find the beginning of the exhibition, which no signs\nbother to tell me is upstairs.\nI know absolutely nothing about Le\nCorbusier (1887 \u2013 1965) when I arrive.\nFor example, I don\u2019t realise that \u2018Le\nCorbusier\u2019 is a moniker for CharlesEdouard Jeanneret. Whatever his\nname was, he started out as a watchmaker who developed an interest in art\nand design. Early on, he followed the\nideas of the Arts and Crafts Movement\n(I know a lot about this \u2013 I did my history A-level coursework on it). Think\ntwee William Morris flowery designs\non old ladies\u2019 shopping bags, but don\u2019t\nforget the rebellion against the Industrial Revolution and undercurrents of\nrampant Communism. But then Le\nCorbusier moved to Paris and got all\ntrendy, hanging out with famous artists like Leger, Picasso, Braque, Picabia\nand Duchamp. He started his own arty\nmagazine called \u2018L\u2019Esprit Nouveau\u2019\n(\u2018New Spirit\u2019, to us Englishfolk). Picasso\nsent in a few token doodles, and these\nare on display. Le Corbusier is already\ngetting interested in architecture, with\nplans for utopias and scrawls of how he\nwanted to solve congestion in Paris by\nredesigning the whole city.\nThis second room is a mix of draw-ings, design, architecture and film, and\nit\u2019s a little confusing. The biography\nand some of the contextual themes are\nlost in the chopping and changing between media. It\u2019s not very clear how Le\nCorbusier went from training locally\nas a watchmaker to designing whole\nbuildings, for example. The narrative\nis very grand and conceptualised. Another addition to the confusion is that\nSee, this Le Corbusier chap wasn\u2019t just an architect - he also did\nstrange paintings. Is that a boob I see before me?\nwork by other artists who influenced\nLe Corbusier is inter-mingled with Le\nCorbusier\u2019s own work, with little disct-inction. These criticisms are true of\nmost of the exhibition. But I\u2019m getting\ninto the nitty gritty here \u2013 the general\nSTUFF is all lovely. This is one of my\nfavourite periods in art and design; the\ntransition from the traditional of the\nnineteenth century to the explosion of\nmodernism in the twentieth. The sleek,\ncrisp modern style pokes through early\non amongst the conventional, making for design that\u2019s eye-catching and\nexciting.\nThere\u2019s a little Mondrian on loan\nfrom the Tate which I recognise. You\ndon\u2019t expect there to be so many parallels between these different artists and\nstyles, but it makes perfect sense next\nto the crisp white models of Le Corbusier\u2019s architecture. The Cubist influences shine through as flat top roof\nterraces, square form and simple lines.\nI absolutely love these houses \u2013 I want\nto live in one very badly.\nSuddenly we swing from architecture and interiors to paintings. His\npaintings are extremely similar to\nLeger\u2019s. But Le Corbusier is a jack-of-all-trades kind of guy, and his paintings\naren\u2019t as mind-blowingly excellent as\nsome of his painter chums. I think his\ndesign and architecture is much bet-ter. He was certainly a visionary, with\ngrand schemes for world domination.\nHe wanted to redesign the cities of the\nworld, restructuring urban areas and\nfilling them with his crisp, tidy build-ings, solving all the world\u2019s problems.\nHe was ambitious, and he does come\nacross as a little smug.\nDownstairs, a highlight is a big tapes-try/fabric piece on the back wall called\n\u201cPresence II or Guard Your Wing in my\nHand\u201d (1949). It\u2019s a bit random. Like his\npaintings only bigger and more vivid,\nand involving a bunch of wild animals.\nThere\u2019s what looks like a rhino, a yak or\nbison, a lion and a few gazelle. But in\nthe centre there\u2019s a big punching hand\nin a modern graffiti-like style, and a big\npair of boobs.\nI say there\u2019s a lot of arty paintings and\nso forth, but the exhibition has plenty\nfor architecture buffs. There are some\npieces focusing on different commissions he received from across the\nworld, including locations like Chandigarh in India. There\u2019s a lot of material\non the Saint-Pierre Church in Firminy.\nThis was designed by him but not built\nin his lifetime. Construction started in\n1970, stopped in 1978 and then some\nnice people got around to finishing it\noff in 2003-6. It\u2019s impressive how well\nthe design has endured. The model of it\nnearly fills a room \u2013 it\u2019s incredibly tall,\nwith steep sides like a mountain. There\nare plans of it, but nobody thought to\nput up a photo of what it looks like\nnow. In fact, there are few such photos\nin the exhibition. I think I\u2019d like to see\nthe buildings for myself to really make\na judgment.\nThe exhibition wraps up with a\nwhole kitchen. Le Corbusier was keen\non designing houses for the masses in\nthe post-war period, in the great tradition of garden cities and new towns.\nThis is another era of design I get excited about \u2013 I love how these famous\nand visionary architects came up with\nplans for what is now a load of bleak\ncouncil flats.\nI\u2019m very impressed by the Barbican\nexhibition space and the way the curators have used it. For example, they\ntake advantage of the split level by\nhanging images at different heights\nso they are best viewed from upstairs.\nLe Corbusier is an interesting subject\nand the contents are varied and quirky.\nYou don\u2019t need a background knowledge of him or the period to appreciate\nthis show. This is a fun one to wander\nround with friends and hang about in,\nrather than taking it too seriously. And\nat \u00a36 for a concession ticket you get a\nlot for your money.\nLe Corbusier: The Art of\nArchitecture\nBarbican\nUntil 24th May 2009\nHere is Le Corbusier, in all his bespectacled glory, poking a naked man\nFor some reason, the arts editor seems to have a foot fetish\nnot as intense or magnified as I would\nimagine being stranded behind enemy\nterritory without supplies would be,\nbut it felt as good as reality had ever\nbeen.\nHowever, literature or cinema as a\ncomplement in this context is usually\nonly applicable when one plans one's\ndestination with some serious intent.\nStumbling upon a destination and using the arts to feed one\u2019s imagination\nis a different matter Reading about\nMayan civilisation after you unwittingly discovered there was more to\nYucatan than Spring Break and Coors\nLite is a perfectly common experience,\nI am sure. For me, as with many oth-ers, I am certain, family trips are prime\ntime for unsuspectingly stumbling on\nan interesting destination.\nI had read about Oregon in National\nGeographic before and watched Rob\nReiner's Stand By Me, but neither of\nthese were sufficient preparation for\nthe sheer beauty of North America's\nPacific Northwest. Jacob Aaron Estes\noft-overlooked Mean Creek (featuring\na pre-Wackness Josh Peck) probably\ndoes the best job of encapsulating the\nsmall-town naivety amidst a summer\nbackdrop of eye-wateringly lush for-ests, sunlicked creeks and breathtaking Cascade volcanoes watching the\nseason pass.\nSo sometimes the anticipation of an\nadventure is the most enticing escape\nof them all, and books, images, pho-tography, music - whatever you wish\nto incorporate into your definition of\n\u201cart\u201d - can make the experience all the\nsweeter. Sometimes it\u2019s sweeter when\nyou stumble upon it, and art can feed\nthose memories until one returns there\nagain. Expectation has the potential to\nresult in epic anticlimax. And for some\nthe escape of travelling through the\narts is enough, and for those without\nthe resources or the constitution to\nmake trips, modest or epic, this is the\nsweetest escape of them all.\nbeen sold out. There was no way that\nGalileo\u2019s findings would go unnoticed\nor unexamined by the Church.\nIn 1616, a panel of the Holy Office\nof the Inquisition pronounced the idea\nof an immobile Sun as \u2018foolish and absurd\u2019 and that the official position on\nCopernican astronomy was \u2018false and\ncontrary to Holy Scripture\u2019. This was\ndelivered to Galileo by the pre-emi-nent Jesuit Cardinal Bellarmin \u2013 the\n\u2018hammer of the heretics\u2019 \u2013 who had in\n1600 prosecuted the priest Giordano\nBruno for heresy and burnt him at the\nstake. Galileo was told that as long as\nhe stuck to a purely hypothetical view\nof the Copernican system and did not\ntry to tell anyone how to interpret the\nBible, he would be safe.\nEight years later, encouraged by the\nelection of Cardinal Barberini, a scientist and friend, as Pope Urban VIII,\nGalileo wrote his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems comparing the Ptolemaic and Copernican\nsystems. This proved one step too far.\nAlthough presented as an intellectual\nargument between imaginary charac-ters, Galileo\u2019s opinions could be easily\ninferred and the name he had given\nto the character putting forward the\nPtolemaic view was the not altogether\nflattering one of \u2018Simplicio\u2019. Urban VIII\nreacted with a fury and a vindictiveness which he was to take to his grave.\nSummoned to Rome, before the Office of the Inquisition and \u2018vehemently\nsuspected of heresy\u2019, Galileo renounced\nhis teachings and vowed never to uphold them again. The Dialogue was\nplaced on the Index of Prohibited\nBooks in 1664 where it would remain\nfor nearly two hundred years.\nGalileo remained under house arrest until his death in 1642. During this\ntime he completed his greatest work\nTwo New Sciences Pertaining To Mechanics and Local Motion which was\nsmuggled out of Italy, printed in 1638\nin Holland, and established some of\nthe fundamentals of physics. By the\ntime of its completion, Galileo had\nlost his sight and was never able to see\nthe printed version. Fully aware of the\nirony, he said to a friend in 1638: \u2018This\nuniverse which I\u2026.enlarged a hundred,\nGalileo\u2019s\nTimeline\nLily Topham engages in a discussion of the issues behind Bertolt Brecht\u2019s The\nLife of Galileo, in anticipation of DramSoc\u2019s production of the play next week.\nBertolt Brecht and Galileo Galilei\nT\nhis year is the four hundredth anniversary of the\ntelescope, the international year of astronomy,\nthe two hundredth anniversary of Darwin, the one hundred\nand fiftieth anniversary of the publication of The Origin Of Species, and also\nhappens to be the year that DramSoc\nwill be performing Bertolt Brecht\u2019s\nThe Life Of Galileo. Including that final point may look a little incongruous\nin terms of the epic sweep of history,\nbut it is not a bad time to put on a play\nabout a long-dead man whose controversial theories about the world are\nnow common-knowledge.\nBrecht and Galileo were both giants\nin their respective fields, engendered\npassionate loathing and admiration,\nand became legends within their own\nlifetimes.\nIt is hard now, in an age of Star Wars,\nwhere every child in primary school is\ntold the names of the planets, where we\nall know that we are on a small planet\norbiting an insignificant star in the spiral arm o one galaxy among millions\nin an infinite universe, to understand\nhow people believed that the Earth was\nthe centre of the cosmos. However, as\nfar as people of Galileo\u2019s time were\nconcerned, the sun and the stars all\nformed part of the heavenly spheres,\nset in perfect circles, revolving around\na stationary Earth. This worldview\nput forward by Aristotle and Ptolemy\n(who, ironically, were \u2018heathens\u2019) was\nan integral part of the doctrine of the\nCatholic Church.\nIn order to see the impact of Galileo\u2019s teachings, we have to understand\nthe fundamental effects which Galileo\u2019s findings had on the way in which\npeople saw themselves and the world.\nIt was not simply a case of what happened in the heavens above people\u2019s\nheads, but how it affected the very\npurpose and position of people in society and the emergence of the role of\nexperimental proof in science which\ncould be applied to all walks of life.\nGalileo did not pluck his ideas out\nof nowhere. By the early sixteenth\ncentury, Nicolaus Copernicus had developed a theory which removed the\nearth from the centre of the universe.\nIn his work On The Revolution of the\nCelestial Spheres published in 1543 the\nEarth became simply another planet.\nConsidering the potential import of\nthis work, it did not cause nearly as\nmuch of a fuss as might be expected.\nCertainly, it was hardly a bestseller \u2013\nthe first print ran 400 copies, which\nfailed to sell out. In it, Copernicus was\nmerely postulating a theoretical view;\nincluding nothing to prove his theo-ries. In the sixteenth and seventeenth\ncenturies the Catholic Church was developing an early form of fundamentalism \u2013 strengthening their theological\nstandpoints and placing a greater emphasis on adherence to the established\nteachings of the Church.\nBorn in Pisa, Italy in 1564, Galileo\nwas a respected and well-established\nlecturer and researcher at the University of Padua. Characterised by a fierce\nenergy and an energetic belief in the\npower of experimentation, during the\nearly 1600s, Galileo wanted to end the\nignorance of Nature\u2019s laws of motion.\nHe was distracted by news of a recent Dutch invention, the \u2018eyeglass\u2019,\nwhich he proceeded to refine and presented to the entire Venetian senate to\nthe great astonishment of all. Even the\noldest senators clambered up the highest towers of the city to look through\nGalileo\u2019s remarkable telescope and see\nships on the horizon a good two or\nthree hours before the youngest, keen-est, unaided eyes. However, it was Galileo\u2019s further refinements of this instrument which made it so substantially\ndifferent from the little curiosity pieces\nthey had previously been. By 1609, he\ncould magnify objects by a factor of\ntwenty; and when he turned his gaze\non the moon and the stars it would irrevocably change the way society dealt\nwith science. Galileo saw sights which\nno-one had seen before; the mountains\non the surface of the moon, the Milky\nWay and the four moons of Jupiter\nwhich he dedicated to Florence in his\nwork: The Starry Messenger.\nGalileo\u2019s discoveries were greeted\nwith huge attention and acclaim \u2013\nwithin a week of publication, all of the\ncopies of The Starry Messenger had\nnay, a thousandfold\u2026.is now for me so\ndiminished and reduced, it has shrunk\nto the meagre confines of my body.\u2019\nBrecht\u2019s The Life Of Galileo is by no\nmeans a factual account of Galileo\u2019s\nlife. It focuses on the latter part of his\nlife and plays fast and loose with dates\nand facts. This is hardly surprising as\nBrecht did not aim to write costume\ndramas; the epic theatre movement\nwhich he championed aimed to ensure\nthat the audience was always aware it\nwas watching a play and be provoked\ninto rational self-reflection in order\nto use theatre as a political and social\nmedium. However, in this play and its\ndifferent manifestations and revisions\nover the years, there is more than a\npurely didactic message; there are real\ncharacters, with very human flaws and\nquestions that are raised which are relevant today and will continue to be.\nThe story of the creation of The Life\nof Galileo as a play spans nearly twenty\nyears. Initially written in German in\n1938 whilst in exile in Denmark, Brecht seriously revised the play when\nCharles Laughton approached him in\nLos Angeles in 1944. During this period the play itself became much shorter\nand eventually, after years of rewriting and multiple changes in directors,\nopened at the Coronet Theatre in Los\nAngeles with Laughton in the title role\nto a mixed reception. Indeed, it was\nsaid that Laughton was so nervous and\nfidgety that the costume designer was\nordered to sew up his trouser pockets\nto stop him playing with himself in the\nopening scene.\nBrecht continued to revisit and revise\nthe play up till his death in 1956, and\nsince then, translators from Howard\nBrenton to David Hare have adapted\nthe play further. Throughout Brecht\u2019s\nre-writes of his play, his aim was to\nshow the impact of self-realisation\nupon a man who meets a test and fails.\nThis play removes the romanticised\nimage of Galileo declaiming against his\ncritics in the Office of the Holy Inquisition, and repositions him as a simple\nman, susceptible to normal human\npettiness, greed, love of food and com-fort, fear of pain and capable of great\nmoral and intellectual failure.\nBrecht shows the audience a startling image of men and women alone\nin the universe. The play asks how we\nas humans are equipped to cope with\nthe moral decisions which we have to\nmake, what an individual and science\u2019s\nresponsibility for knowledge and our\nactions are and puts forward the passionate argument that one individual\ncan make a difference.\nTowards the end of the play, Galileo\nsays: \u2018I take it the intent of science is\nto ease human existence\u2019. In this age of\ngreat twechnological advances, great\nwealth and yet great poverty and suf-fering, the questions and ideas that this\nplay raises are as relevant today as they\nwere four hundred years ago.\nThe Life of Galileo by Bertolt\nBrecht, translated by Charles\nLaughton is being performed by\nDramsoc from Wed 18th March \u2013\nSat 21st March, 7:30pm.\nAll performances are in the Union\nConcert Hall, Beit, SW7 2BB.\nTickets are available on the door\nor in advance:\nwww.dramsoc.org/tickets.\n\u00a35 Students/\u00a37 Non-Students\n4th C BC\nAristotle writes On\nthe Heavens, his chief\ncosmological treatise.\n1543\nNicolaus Copernicus\npublishes On the\nRevolutions of the\nHeavenly Spheres\n1564\nGalileo Galilei born in\nPisa on February 15th\nto Vincenzo Galilei and\nwife Giulia.\n1589\nGalileo appointed\nas Professor of\nMathematics at the\nUniversity of Pisa.\n1592\nGalileo starts teaching\ngeometry and astronomy\nat the University of\nPadua.\n1600\nGiordano Bruno burns\nat the stake in Rome\nfor advocating the\nheliocentric worldview.\n1609\nGalileo designs his first\ntelescope, which he will\nlater use to discover the\nfour moons of Jupiter.\n1632\nGalileo\u2019s book Dialogue\nConcering the Two\nChief World Systems is\npublished.\n1633\nGalileo is found guilty of\nheresy by the Holy Office\nof the Inquisition.

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nFriday 13 March 2009 felix\nThe sweetest escape of them all\nAlex Marsden considers escape of travel through art - is the endeavour of travel sweeter through the\nmedium of art or through personal experience? And can one complement the other?\nS\no here we are, another week,\nanother editorial. Time to\nwitter on about me and my\ndaily life and trick you into\nthinking it\u2019s relevant to culture and the arts.\nThis week I went to the Barbican\ncentre which, it turns out, is some kind\nof glorious Mecca for the arts all under one central London roof. I\u2019d only\never been once before, at night, for a\ngig (of sorts \u2013 long story) so did not\nget to fully appreciate its sheer bril-liance. It has art in the conventional\npainting sense, theatre, dance, music\nand cinema all housed under some top\nnotch architecture. They have lots of\nfree events too; when I was there it was\n\u201cDo Something Different\u201d weekend,\nand there were kidlets as far as the eye\ncould see, doing crafts and dressing up\nin wigs. I think, on the whole, I quite\nlike to move in and take up permanent\nresidence. They have big blocks of flats\nall around so this would be a feasible\ngoal, were it not for the price of living\nin a trendy location of central London,\ncoupled with my career prospects or\nlack thereof. Damn.\nSomething I\u2019ve been thinking about\nthis week is how we define ourselves\nhere in the \u201cCulture and The Arts\u201d\nsection. To my knowledge there have\nbeen no debates/disagreements/all-out\nbrawls over whether an article or topic\nshould be covered in the arts section\nor elsewhere in felix (let\u2019s disregard the\nEmily Wilson\nArts Editor\nfact that probably nobody would care).\nI can think of many scenarios where an\narticle could legitimately be claimed by\neither us or film, nightlife, clubs/socie-ties, music\u2026 For example, if I go to an\nevening event at the V&A and I write\nabout it, is that arts or is that nightlife?\nIf I see an orchestra perform, is that\narts or music? If I see an exhibition\nat the Science Museum, is that arts or\nscience? Suggestions for something\nthe arts and sports sections could fight\nover on a postcard please.\nThe trigger that got my mind whirring on this little debate was American Psycho. I read the book and the\nother night I watched the film. For the\nrecord, the book was incredibly brilliant and disgustingly violent, while\nthe film was moderately good, surprisingly unviolent, but not a bad representation of the book (resisting urge to\nramble on\u2026). Hypothetically speaking,\nif I were to write an article comparing\nand contrasting the book and the film\n(which I could do, quite easily, but it\nwould descend into rant and gorily\ngraphic descriptions), where in Felix\nshould it be printed? And who should\ndecide?\nAnyhoo. I hope you enjoy this week\u2019s\narts section. I had fun writing for it. If\nyou want to have fun writing for it, why\ndon\u2019t you email us? arts.felix@imperial.\nac.uk is where to find us. Bonus points\nto anybody who initiates a fistfight in\nfelix.\nFistfights in the\nfelix office?\nT\nravel literature and writing can be a tricky topic.\nMore broadly, anything\npertaining to \"travel\" is\nregarded by most as a predominantly positive endeavour. I have\nlost count of the number of friends and\nacquaintances who harbour clandestine desires to embark on alternate or\ndream careers as presenters of travel\nprogrammes, and I have allowed myself\nto wallow in the thought of being paid\nto embark on the kinds of indulgences\nmost of us save and plan and look forward to for a paltry three weeks of the\nyear\nPaul Theroux was famously scathing of the genre of travel writing when\nhe branded it self-indulgent, predictable and dull. Though apparently true\nwhen one dedicates oneself to a world\ncapable of producing the same circumstances each and every time regardless\nof location, this will be of little consequence for the majority of us for whom\nthe opportunity to see the world is a\nrare and precious one to be seized.\nWriting exclusively on the process\nand experience of travel is one way to\napproach the topic, but equally enticing are the authors allow us to travel\nthrough their characters' situations\nand settings.\nThis is more than reading the interesting sections of Lonely Planet - Tibet\nwhilst licking one's lips at the idea of\ndiscovering a hidden Shangri-La hidden deep within the Himalayas. By\ntrusting the writers' experience and\nknowledge, we can walk the same\nstreets as their characters and meet the\nsame people and live the same lives.\nI have enjoyed reading about a Dublin\npast through Joyce, immersed myself\nin the Istanbul of Orhan Pamuk's stories and found new appreciation for the\ncrackpots in our very own city thanks\nto Zadie Smith. Watching anything by\nWoody Allen or Edward Burns makes\nme want to spend more time on the\nsidewalks of the Five Boroughs.\nBut does this actually work? Literature and art as an enhancer or complement to the experience of travel?\nI have read books before and during\ntrips, but mostly before. The anticipa\u201cThe anticipation\nof adventure can\nbe most enticing\u201d\ntion is one of the best parts of the experience of this curiosity we know as\n\"travel\" but when on the road, so to\nspeak, one is usually too busy social-ising, sleeping, living and experiencing to bother with Hajime's extended\nconsideration of how his parents met\nor the extended meditation of existence with regard to the protagonist's\nhometown.\nSo taking in such art during travel\nis a bad time. After travel can be nonexistent - one's expectations are either\nusually fulfilled, leaving no desire to\nindulge in further fantasies, or are too\nsteeped in disappointment to the point\nthat it is too painful or frustrating to\nread about something you felt didn't\nexist or you missed out on.\nI read Wei Hui's epic statement of one\nwoman's emancipation in Shanghai\nBaby as a precursor to a much-antic-ipated stay in Shanghai. Though admi-rable, her descriptions of the city were\noverwhelmed by the sheer amount of\nto-ing and fro-ing and romantic plots\nand subplots. Nothing she wrote could\npossibly have done justice to the sheer,\nhead-spinning vibrancy and vitality of\na city destined for greatness, both simultaneously delirious and apoplectic\nat its newfound level of decadence and\ncharisma. This is what you get for judging and paying for a book by its cover.\nSimilarly, anyone who watched anything by Wong Kar-Wai prior to a trip\nto Singapore or Hong Kong was bound\nto be disappointed that the streets\nwere not littered with Maggie Cheungs\nor Tony Leungs, and that every single\nmoment failed to resemble a breathtakingly stylised paean to whimsy and\nheartbreak. Hoping for a retrofantasti-cal place as such was asking to be let\ndown, and similarly expecting Machu\nPicchu, Angkor or anywhere with similarly epic promises to live up to them\ncan be like knocking on the door of\ndisappointment. Reading Lost Horizon and making the trip to Shangri-La\n(it exists, but as an artificial cash cow\nfor tourism) are two wholly different\nthings and hoping for the reality to resemble the fantasy is like pretending\nSanta Claus exists.\nFor a trip through Mongolia, I revisited a memorable segment of Murakami's The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle\ntelling the account of a failed reconais-sance mission by some Japanese troops\nstranded in Mongolia during the Second World War. The novel left an impression of a vastness, desolation and\ndesperate harshness coupled to desperate and horrific circumstances that left\nme equal parts repelled and gravititat-ing towards the region. The reality was\ndifferent, but no less epic. Waking up\nin a landscape only describable as utterly alien and racing towards the horizon in a train seemingly suspended on\na flat ocean of land, the earth flat in all\ndirections to the horizon, left me suitable awestruck. The experience was\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n12 felix Friday 13 March 2009\nPolitics\nPolitics Editors \u2013 James Goldsack & Katya-yani Vyas\nS\no, elections are once again\nupon us. Poster bearing candidates stalking the walkway,\nflyer wielding camapaign-ers ambushing you during\nluchtime in the JCR. lollipops and flying saucers offered up as payment for\nour votes. Like such bribery would\nwork! Ok, fine, sometimes it does,\npeople seem to be particularly fond of\nlollipops...\nUnion politics is a difficult subject\nto understand, luckily for you there is\na 12 page special in this issue to explain the inner workings of the Union.\nMarvellous!\nRight, so that is that. I will go no\nfurther than to wish all the candidates\ngood luck and to discourage any slanderous or inapropriate comments.\nI suppose it is very easy at a time like\nthis to get so caught up in our University bubble that we forget about the\nouitside world. With this in mind, I\nasked some fellow students for some\nquotations and compiled them here.\nThe question I asked was; \u201cWhat is\nan important political issue at the moment\u201d Here are a selection;\n\u201cThe most important issue in politics\ntoday is whether or not the US will remain the worlds only superpower.\u201d\n\u201cThe protests against British troops\nare absolutely disgusting, it is not the\nfault of the troops but the government\u201d\n\u201cI dont know much about politics\nbut I think that...\u201d It took ages to get\neven that out of one student.\n\u201cAre we really going to come out of\nOn Tuesday 24th February, a speech\ngiven by prominent Kurdish politician\nAhmet Turk was abruptly censored on\nTurkish state television when Mr. Turk\nstarted speaking in Kurdish.\nIn Turkey, with a substantial ethnic\nKurdish population, it has long been\nforbidden to speak Kurdish in public.\nMr. Ahmet Turk might face prosecution for disobeying the law for it is illegal for Kurdish to be spoken in the\nTurkish Parliament building.\n\u201cWe have no objection to Turkish being the official language, yet we want\nour demands for the lifting of the ban\non the Kurdish language to be understood as a humanitarian demand,\u201d\nAhmet Turk said. Mr. Turk replied to\ncriticism for his Kurdish talk by pointing out that Turkish PM Recep Teyyip\nErdogan had spoken a few Kurdish\nwords on the newly launched Kurdish television channel TRT-6, which is\nrestricted to only broadcasting issues\nrelated to culture, music and other\nnon-political matters. \u201cIf the PM can\ndo it, then why can\u2019t I?\u201d, Ahmet asked\nrhetorically.\nIn Turkey the use of the Kurdish language is still a very sensitive matter.\nUntil as recent as 1991 the fifteen to\ntwenty million Kurds in Turkey were\nnot recognized as a distinct ethnic\ngroup from the Turks, but were rather\nreferred to as \u2018mountain Turks\u2019 for they\nusually live on higher plateaus in parts\nof Turkey. In that year, when a Kurdish\npolitical party entered the Turkish Parliament for the first time in history, an\nupheaval broke out around the Kurdish\nspeech given by female politician Leyla\nZana, who was later imprisoned for it.\nZana went on to be nominated for the\nNobel Peace Prize. Even now, Kurdish\nis illegal to be spoken in many public\nspaces (amongst which the Turkish\nParliament) and is not allowed to be\ntaught to primary school children in\nKurdistan.\nCNN spoke of \u2018irony\u2019 on the incident,\nwriting on their website that \u2018it is in\ncontradiction with the recent launch of\nthe Kurdish TV-channel\u2019. The incident\nhas therefore sparked mistrust among\nmany Kurds who see TRT-6 as a pure\ntactic of propaganda from the ruling\nAKP party, trying to win over Kurdish voters for the upcoming provincial\nelections in March.\nMr. Ahmet Turk is a prominent political member of the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP), which\nwas elected to Parliament by the mini-mum-required 20 seats in the national\nelections of July 2007. By standing as\nindividual candidates, the DTP-members were able to join forces afterwards\nand thus avoid the obstruction posed\nby the 10% Turkish threshold required\nfor a party to gain seats in Parliament,\nwhich is the highest in Europe.\nWith thirty-five to forty millions\nsouls, the Kurds are the largest ethnic\ngroup in the world without their own\nstate. In the four countries in which\nthe Kurds live \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Syria and\nTurkey \u2013 it is in the latter two that they\nhave not only long been under oppression from the ruling forces in those\ncountries, but furthermore have also\nspecifically endured the subjugation\nof their cultural norms and linguistic\npractises.\nIn today\u2019s Iraq, Kurdistan is an official semi-independent federal region,\noften referred to as the Kurdistan Region, with its own government, consti-tution, security forces and presidency.\nKurdish being closely related to Persian, the Kurds enjoy formal recognition by the Iranian government, with\na province in the country officially\nnamed \u2018Kurdistan\u2019, literally meaning\n\u2018the land of the Kurds\u2019 and formally\ndefinable as the geographic, ethnic\nand historic land inhabited mostly by\nthe Kurds. Recently, the Iranian foreign minister Mr. Mottaki furthermore\nopened a consulate in Arbil, the capital\ncity of the Kurdistan Region, with the\nhope of leading to the strengthening\nof ties between the two. His German\ncounterpart Mr. Steinmeier only recently followed in his footsteps.\nDuring a traditional World Economic\nForum session in Davos, Switzerland,\non 29th January 2009, the Turkish PM\nheavily criticised the former Israeli\npresident Peres for the recent offensive\nin Gaza, saying to him amongst others\n\u2018you know how to kill very well\u2019 and\n\u2018you kill children on the beaches\u2019. In re-sponse, Israeli Maj. Gen. Avi Mizrahi\npointed out that \u2018Erdogan should look\nin the mirror first of all\u2019, referring to the\noppression of the Kurds in Kurdistan\nand the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus.\nEarly last year, Erdogan made a similar ironic statement on a visit to Germany, home to a substantial Turkish\nimmigration population. Speaking to\na Turkish crowd in Ludwigshafen, he\nurged the German Turks not to assimilate into the society in which they live,\nbut rather to maintain their own habits and cultures, a fact which has been\ntrue in the opposite for most Kurds in\nTurkey. Unlike this latter group, Turkish populations in Western countries\nAhmet Turk was censored for speaking Kurdish on Turkish television\nKatya-yani Vyas\nPolitics Editor\nIt\u2019s all so\nconfusing...\nNo Kurdish allowed\nare free to set up lobbying movements,\nfree to establish parties promoting\ntheir heritage, culture and language\nwithout the fear of it being forcefully\nshut down or even face political persecution as a result of the countries\u2019 legislative authorities.\nOne of the main issues on the negotiating table between the EU and\nTurkey for the latter to gain membership of the organisation has been the\nKurdish issue. The remnants of Kemalism \u2013 the nationalist ideology imposed\nby the first president of modern Turkey, Kemal Mustafa Ataturk \u2013 are still\never present in Turkish society. The\nultra-nationalist MHP-party continues\nto advocate the creation of a united\n\u2018Turan\u2019, based on the unity of all Turkic\npeoples. One of the most significant\nremnants of Kemalism can be found in\nthe Turkish constitution, which writes\nthat it is considered a violation of rights\nif somebody would offend the Turkish\nnation state or its creator.\nAs a result, censorship in Turkey has\nbeen placed repeatedly on globally accessible websites like Youtube, where\nusers are able to exert this criticism\nwithout fearing prosecution under the\nTurkish law.\nAlthough nationalistic Turkish public opinion would fiercely resent any\nconcessions to the Kurds in the time of\nand on behalf of the Erdogan adminis-tration, leading political experts claim\nthat the current Prime Minister should\npublicly recognize the political, economic and cultural suffering that the\nKurdish people in Turkey were made\nto go through in past government eras\nas a gesture of reconciliation.\nRaz Jabary\nJames Goldsack\nPolitics Editor\nBring on the\norgies\nV\noting is open to one hell\nof a lot of abuse. Some\nexperts even believe that\nthe democratic method\nwe use is in fact seriously\nout-of-date and flawed, largely leading\nto not what is intended; the favourite,\neven least-disliked candidate being\nfound the victor. Instead, the result can\nonly be described as a shambles.\nRealistically, people vote for many\ndistinct reasons. Some vote for selfish\nand individualistic reasons, others for\nnoble reasons like for the greater good.\nWhile we believe that it actually works,\nanother factor is heavily involved.\nNot in the act of voting but before.\nFor a long time dubious tactics not\nonly have been used to get people to\nremember political candidates, also\nfrequently to subliminaly make voters\neventually decide to vote for them.\nLately, this technique has been used\nin the US elections. Made famous by\nX-rated frames added into film reels,\neveryone should know how this was\ndone from \u201cFight Club\u201d. Watch it.\nIndeed, subliminal messaging was\ntypically made illegal some years ago\nor at least it should have been.\nReports have been made of findings\ninto how much these subliminal messages really affect people\u2019s perception\nand actions. It has been shown to work\nwonders and it is a very dangerous, or\nbrilliant, use of technology.\nMaybe some of this years Union candidates should use it.\nMany people do not know anything\nabout the workings of the Union so\nhow can we be expected to make an\ninformed decision? How are we supposed to know what an honourary\ntreasury secretary ACTUALLY does?\nThis is one final problem with public\nvoting.\nPerhaps we should go back to Plato\u2019s\nidea of a benevolent ruling elite to run\neverything for us, a group of people\nwho actually KNOW what to do.\nGo Plato.\nOh and don\u2019t forget the orgies.\nthe recession by 2010?\u201d\n\u201cReduction of emissions is very\nimportant\u201d\nAll are interesting issues, even the\nthird which highlights a general lack of\ninterest for politics amongst students.\nI am going to focus on the recent\nprotest in Luton against British troops\nreturning from Iraq. Protesters were\nheard to shout at the marching soldiers\n\u201cTerrorists\u201d and \u201cAnglian Soldiers Go\nto Hell\u201d. In addition, some were holding up placards with the words \u201cButchers of Basra\u201d written in distinct red\nletters.\nTo say that this is distasteful would\nbe a woeful understatement. The army\nis there to obey the commands of the\ngovernment wthout question. For a\ngroup of anti-war protesters to behave\nin such a disrespectful manner towards\npeople who have devoted their lives to\ntheir country is absolutely awful.\nIronically, the protesters then had to\nbe protected by another division of the\ncivil service, the police, as supporters\nof the soldiers turned on them, shout-ing, \u201cscum\u201d and \u201cNo surrender to the\nTaleban\u201d.\nGordon Brown expressed his disappointment saying \u201cThe whole country\nis proud of our brave servicemen and\nwomen\u201d and that it was \u201cdisappointing\nthat a tiny minority tried, but ultimately failed, to disrupt the event.\u201d\nI am retreating to the haven of union politics for the evening, the outside\nworld is beyond my understanding\nsometimes.\n\n"
