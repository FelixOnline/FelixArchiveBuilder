    "content": "Review5 March 1993 Felix 960\nNew Restaurant Special\nGood morning, crap lecture, ain't it? If you missed breakfast this\nmorning then don't read on because\nthis is Felix's answer to the Beebs\nGood Food Guide....it's the Good\nFood Column. Every week, we -Vic & Nainish - will be reviewing\nrestaurants at which you can enjoy\nyourselves and have a good meal.\nThe examination will be from a student point of view, with the\nconclusive, all important 10 scale.\nSo, to start it all off, we have the\nlocal Luigi Malone's, and the rather\ncentrally located Chicago Rib Shack\nII.\nLuigi Malone' s Next to Europa on Old Brompton\nis \"Luigi Malone's\". To get to the\nseating area, you have to pass\nthrough the bar, and it is at this\npoint you realise that this place is\nsmall. Don't let this scare you away\nthough, the atmosphere is superb -'friendly and cosy'.\nOnto the meal though. The menu\nis wide-ranging, as is common these\ndays, with a choice to placate any\npalate. You don't need a starter, but\nif you insist on one the garlic bread\n(\u00a31.50) is the cheapest, and the brie\nwith wild cherries (\u00a32.95) is\nimaginative.\nThe main meal is HUGE. A pizza\n(\u00a34.65 - \u00a35.95) is enough for two,\nand very few people ever get round\nto finishing the whole course. There\nare various types of burgers (\u00a34.95\n- \u00a35.25), but be warned they come\nrare, tell them if you want it\ndifferent. There are salads of all\nkinds. There are the mandatory\npasta dishes. Club sandwiches for\nthe aspiring yuppies and of course\nsteaks - even a16 oz one for those\nwith a humongous appetite! They\nhave not forgotten about\nvegetarians, here again the variety\nof choices is good.\nIf there is still some space left in\nyour tummy, the deserts follow the\ntrend set from before. They are\nlarge and good. Vic could have\nswum in his Hot Fudge Sundae\n(\u00a32.45), and Nainish's Tiramisu\n(\u00a32.45) was gorgeous.\nThe waiters will bring cocktails\n(\u00a32.95) - in Happy Hour (\u00a32.25)to your table, and these are rather\nlarge too. All the other soft drinks\nare available, but the cocktails are\nmixed well, even if there is not such\na large choice.\nThe major drawback though was\nthat Luigi Malone's was way too\ncramped for our liking. Vic found\na severe lack of elbow room, and\nthere is no where to stretch your\nlegs. It was quite dimly lit, giving\na romantic feel to the place, but the\natmosphere smacked of anything\nbut.\nLuigi Malone's has specials at\nlunch with every main course\nserved with a free drink (of any\nkind), so pricing it just above the\nMain Dining Hall, but with more\nvariety.\nAll-in-all Luigi Malone's proves\nthat size is not everything - it might\nbe small but you get big portions.\nOn the 10 scale Vic gives it a7, and\nNainish says 7.\n\u2022 73 Old Brompton Rd.\nChicago Rib Shack II\nThe 'Chicago Rib Shack II' is set\non two levels, with the bar on the\nground floor, and the food in the\nbasement. The bar is one of the best\nwe have come across, with the\ncocktails large and very well mixed.\nThere is a menu of 16 titles, but ask\nfor your fave, they'll know it. Try\nto go during Happy Hour (5-11pm), when cocktails are half price\n(\u00a32.45).\nThe Meal. Not a vegetarians\ndelight, but Ribs are their speciality.\nThe Ribs form the main choice\nfrom the menu, but there is also\nchili, grilled steak, and Fajita's. We\nrecommend the combination meal\n(\u00a39.95), giving you choice and a full stomach. There is a wide range\nof side dishes, the onion loaf\n(\u00a32.95) is truly huge and the corn-on-the-cob (\u00a31.95) is the best we've\ntasted.\nDesserts are great (\u00a32.25 - \u00a33.75),\nyou'll not believe the banana split,\nand Vic doesn't believe even\ncho ca holi cs will be able to finish off\nthe mud pie.\nDecorations are a good talking\npoint during the meal, with large\nFlintstone characters staring at you\nfrom all around, but unfortunately\nthe music is rather plain. The\nservice is good, with the waiters\neven offering to put your bib on for\nyou. Service is quick with our meal\narriving in 15 minutes during a busy\nspell.\nWe say a place to visit if you're\nin Leicester Square and have \u00a315\ndoing nothing. On the scale Nainish\nawards 6, and Vic 6.\n\u2022 3-17 Bear Street Off Leicester\nSquare\nPage 22\nADVERTISEMENT\nVote Ian 'Poddy' Davies for Felix Editor, Print Unit Manager, in all departments 8,9 March.\nSound bites.\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nIran\nOften closed off to the Western visitor, Iran's secrets are revealed to Impe\nCollege in the pages of Felix\nIran covers 636,300 square miles\n(1,648,000 square kilo mete is) in\nsouthwestern Asia. It is bounded on\nthe north by the republics of\nArmenia, Azerbaijan,\nTurkmenistan, and the Caspian Sea,\non the south by the Persian Gulf and\nthe Gulf of Oman, on the east by\nPakistan and Afghanistan, and on\nthe west by Turkey and Iraq. Iran\nalso controls about a dozen islands\nin the Persian Gulf. More than 30%\nof its 4,770 mile boundary is\nseacoast. The capital is Tehran. The\ncurrency is Rial. Among Middle\nEastern countries, Iran is unique in\nmany ways. Its official language,\nFarsi (Persian), is Indo-European.\nWhile Iran adopted a modified\nversion of the Arabic alphabet, it\ndid not lose its separate identity\nafter the establishment of the Arab\nEmpire in the 7th century.\nIran is the only country in the\nMiddle East that uses the Islamic\nsolar calendar, which originated\nbefore the beginning of the Persian\nEmpire (550 BC). The Arabic lunar\ncalendar is used for religious\nobservances. After the conversion\nof the vast majority of Iranians to\nIslam, the ancient Iranian calendar\nwas adjusted to begin with the year\nof the Prophet Mohammad's immigration to Medina (the hijrah),\nequivalent to AD622. The Iranian\nyear begins on 21 March (beginning\nof spring) and all the twelve months\ncoincide exactly with the zodiac\nmonths.\nIran's complex climate ranges\nfrom subtropical to subpolar.\nAltitude, latitude, maritime\ninfluences, seasonal winds, and\nproximity to mountain ranges or\ndeserts play a significant role in the\nfluctuation of temperature, which\nvaries from a high of 55 \u00b0C in\nKhuzestan Province at the head of\nthe Persian Gulf to a low of -35 \u00b0C in Azarbaijan Province in the\nnorthwest. Rain fall also varies\nwidely, from less than two inches\nin the southeast to about 78 inches\nin the Caspian region.\nIran is a multilingual and diverse\ncultural society. Nearly half of the\npeople speak Farsi, and the other\nhalf speak various Indo-European\nlanguages or dialects. Other\nlanguages spoken in Iran include\nKurdish, Luri, Baluchi, a variety of\nTurkic languages, Armenian, and\nArabic. Persian literature and\nespecially the poetry have\ninfluenced a lot of poets, writers\nand philosophers in the rest of the\nworld. Among the great names in\nPersian literature are those of\nFirdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Sa'adi,\nHafiz, and Mowlana.\nThe vast majority of Iranians are\nMuslims, mostly of the Shi'ite\nbranch, which is the official state\nreligion. Kurds and Turkmen are\nSunnite Muslims, and among Iran's Arabs the Sunnites and other sects\nare represented. Major religious\nminorities are Christians, Jews, and\nZoroastrians. -Christians comprise\nthe largest minority group, of whom\nOrthodox Armenians constitute the\nbulk. The Zoroastrains are largely\nconcentrated in Yazd in central\nIran, Kerman to the southeast, and\nTehran.\nTraditions have remained strong\nin Iran throughout its long history.\nDespite war, strife, floods and\nearthquakes, the character of these\ntraditions has persisted, surviving\noften in a hidden form only to be\nre-discovered and explored by later\ngenerations. There are several\nfestive occasions that Iranians\ncelebrate. Some of these festivals\nstem from the ancient times and the\nothers have religious origins. The\nmost important of the ancient\ncelebrations is Noruz, the Persian\nNew Year, which begins on the last\nWednesday of the old year with a festival of lights and fire\n(Charshanbeh Soori), followed by\na week-long holiday, and continues\nuntil the 13th day of the new year,\nwhich is a day for picnicking in the\ncountryside (Sizdahbedar). Other\nimportant ancient celebrations\ninclude the festival of harvest\n(Mehrgan) at the beginning of\nautumn and the longest night of the\nyear, 21 December (Yalda).\nAmongst the religious festivals the\nbirthdays of the Prophet\nMohammad and the Twelfth Imam\nof the Shi'ites, Mahdi are two of the\nmost prominent ones. On the\nTwelfth Imam's birthday, cities\nthroughout Iran sparkle with lights,\nand the bazaars are decorated and\nteam with shoppers. Other religious\nfestivals of great importance are the\nday of the Prophet Mohammad's appointment as the last prophet of\nGod (Mabaath), the first day after\nthe holy month of Ramadan (Eid-e Fitr), and the day of celebrating\nthe completion of the annual\nMuslims' pilgrimage to Mecca\n(Eid-e Ghorban).\nIran's most important natural\nresources are oil and natural gas.\nProduction and exploration are\nconcentrated in the southwest of the\ncountry, but oil has also been\ndiscovered in north-central region,\nas well as under the offshore waters\nof the Persian Gulf. Apart from oil,\ncarpet weaving, a traditional Iranian\nindustry, remains important and the\nPersian carpet is one of Iran's most\nsignificant exports. Carpet looms\nare seen in most rural areas of the\ncountry. Each locality prides itself\non a special design and quality of\ncarpet that bears its name, such as\nEsfahan, Kashan, Kerman, Shiraz,\nTabriz, Nain and Qum. Other\nimportant exports of Iran known\nworldwide are Iranian caviar,\npistachio nuts, saffron and\nPage 10\nADVERTISEMENT\nVote Ian 'Poddy* Davies for Felix Editor, Print Unit Manager, in all departments 8,9 March.\nPull the other one...\n\n"

Dr Simon\nWalker, warden of Weeks and\nGarden Hall, was unavailable for\ncomment, but Dr Ian Metcalfe, sub-warden of Garden Hall, said that\nthese rumours had been circulating\nfor some time. Dr Metcalfe stated\nthat it had been suggested that the\nhall might be closing this year. He\nwent on to say that, if the hall was\nto close it would so that work could\nbe done to bring the hall into line\nwith fire regulations. He also said\nthat he is 'more optimistic than ever\nbefore that the hall will be improved\nand that if it is I don't think it will\nhave to close.'\nHowever, doubts were expressed\nat recent Advisory Group\nResidents' Meetings as to the\navailability of Garden Hall next\nyear as a student residence. The\nAdvisory Group is body made up\nof Student representatives, Hall\nWardens and College Management,\nwhich advises the Rector on\naccommodation policy. Questions\nraised are believed to centre around\nthe capacity of Garden Hall to pass\na Health and Safety inspection in its\ncurrent state of repair.\nAs yet no re-applicants or ReApps, students who spend an extra\nyear in a hall, have been allocated.\nThis delay in allocation, when all\nother Imperial College Halls are\ngoing through the process of giving\nout Re-App places, has fuelled the\nspeculation about Garden's future.\nThe Advisory Group on\nResidences was consulted as to the\ncost of the refurbishment; said to be\nvery high, and this is believed to be\nthe reason why a decision has not\nyet been made over the hall's immediate future.\nIC Student for ULU\nBen Mancock, an Imperial College\nstudent is standing for the post of\nVice President (Finance and\nSocieties) in the University of\nLondon Union.\nHe will be the first Imperial\nStudent to have stood for aUL U post for some considerable time,\nand has been proposed by Chris\nDavidson, ICU President, and Jonty\nBeavan, Felix Editor.\nIf successful in his bid, Mr\nMancock will represent the entirety\nof the students of the University of\nLondon that includes Imperial. The\nelection will take place at a special\nGeneral Union Council in which\nelected delegates from each of the\nColleges of the University of\nLondon vote for each of the posts.\nSadly, Barry died suddenly, on\nTuesday 2nd March, following a heart attack. He will be\nremembered by many students as\nthe Senior Tutor in Mechanical\nEngineering from 1987 to 1992.\nBarry joined the staff in 1962 and\nspent a spell as Assistant Director\nbefore becoming Senior Tutor. He\ntook early retirement last September\nto follow his many and varied\ninterests in the arts and,travel. All\nhis friends in Mech Eng and\nthroughout the College will miss\nhim, as Barry still continued to\nshow an interest in everyone and\noften visited to see friends.

After one song I was\narguing as to whether they had said\n'Hi, we are' or ' Hi we are not'\nCome. They were a big\ndisappointment. Their recently\nreleased album was described by\ncritics as a 'striking painful debut'\nand given full complements of stars\nand marks out of ten, so I had\nexpected something special.\nThousand Yard Stare\nCamden Palace We had never been to 'Feet First'\nbefore due to two things. 1) Mixed\nReports; everyone that liked it was\nsad (although we hadn't quite\nrealised it at the time.) Everyone\nthat hated it had been to Equinox\nand didn't see the funny side. 2) We\nwould have had to have paid to get\nin. (BE A FELIX HACK KIDS ED.)\nSo we get our little stickers from\nthe bouncer and head onwards and\nupwards into 'Poddy Heaven' with\npens and pretensions sharply\npoised. It's nearly ten o 'clock.\nCamden Palace is a converted\ntheatre from the Victorian era,\ncomplete with balustrades, tasteless\nsculpted integuments and dress\ncircle. (No longer enforced.)\nAlthough there is a strict dress code\nhere - Long s leaved band placard,\nhalf hearted long hair and Doctor\nMarten's finest. God I felt old. The\nkids, not a one without the teen\nsuffix, are all team players. There\nis the Poppies crowd, the Neds\ncrowd, the Stuffies crowd (God\nhelp us) and of course the ever so\nsensitive Suede posse, all of whom\nrun on and off the dance floor to fly\ntheir respective colours and throw\n50p coins at the Ian Wrights of the\nopposition.\nOne can only assume that pop is\ndead when, having impressed the\nHacks by knowing all the lyrics to\nthe RATM single ('Fuck you I won't do what you tell me') -The lyrics were completely\nunintelligible, the singer managing\na kind of croaking shout and each\nsong packed three rhythm guitars\nand little else. Very occasionally\nthey offered a glimpse of what I'd hoped for, a more thoughtful,\ndepressive, anguished sound but it\nwas quickly taken over by the\nrel end ess sameness of the music.\nIt's possible that the album and the\nband do not transfer well to the live\narena, it's certain that this\nperformance wouldn't be anything\nspecial on my hi-fi at home. On this\nshowing they get a haddock on the\nfish scale.\nFor a couple of songs it was the\nsame story with Dinosaur Jr. I knew\nit was them as soon as I saw J Mascis doing his Captain Caveman\nimpression, a mass of hair eating a microphone, but somehow I hoped\nit wasn't. After a while they\nswitched guitars and albums, the\n'Where are you?' material being the\nmore successful. Mascis' famous\nsolos were acceptable and supported\nwell by the thundering chord riffs\nand we could even hear the words.\nThey're so lazy though, standing\naround and obstinately ignoring the\naudience, it's impossible to imagine\ngroups like this ever holding really\nlarge concerts, though in many\nways that's a good thing.\nI must admit that our awful location\nabove the crowd probably didn't help their cause, everyone around\nus lounging about sleepily when no\ndoubt the throng below were\nfeverishly hurling themselves\nagainst the music to order. From\nabove it was more like watching the\ncommercials before a feature film.\nI was genuinely shocked when I heard hundreds of voices rise up to\nus, singing 'Freak Scene', the final\nsong played. That, and a cover of\nThe Cure's 'Just like Heaven' apart,\neverything was a little anti-climactic. I never thought I'd believe a grunge power trio could\nmiss its studio production but I did,\nthat and a smaller audience.

At all times of the day and\nnight, people indulge their passion\nfor steaming bowls of noodle-laden\nsoup, sp icily sauced crab, delicately\nbraised chicken, flavoured satay\nand spicy curry.\nWhen the air is redolent with the\nmouth-watering aromas of garlic,\nchilli and ginger, a walk around the\nLawker centre is like taking a cook's tour through the pages of an\nAsian cookbook.\nSingapore has a lot more ot offer.\nA city of many colours and\ncontrasts, cultures and cuisines, you\ncan be sure of finding something to\ndelight you. Festival market Telok Ayer\nIndiahhh\nIndia like a jewel among pebbles, like a sapphire among jewels, like the\njasmine among blossoms, the musk among perfumes, the peacock among\nbirds, the zodiac among the stars is a nation among nations\nBharat or India as it is known in the\nwestern world, the seat of an\nancient civilisation (Mohenjo-dar),\nthe creation of two world religions\n(Hinduism and Budhism), has her\nroots deep in the past. Geography\nand history have combined to\nproduce the human diversity which\nstrikes every visitor to India. This\ndiversity has been the result of\nIndian genius to be able to\nassimilate cultures of various races\nwhich came to India as conquer ers. First came the Persians, the Greeks,\nthe Huns, the Turks, the Afghans,\nthe Mughols and finally the British.\nAll these races of people were\nabsorbed in the ocean of Indian life\nthus generating a kaleidoscope of\ncultures, but always remaining\ntransparent to the underlying and\nancient Vedic culture. India's genius of assimilation can be\ndescribed as adding fresh gems to\nthe jewel in the lotus to make an\never more dazzling display.\nIndia like a jewel among pebbles,\nlike a sapphire among jewels, like\nthe jasmine among blossoms, the\nmusk among perfumes, the peacock\namong birds, the zodiac among the\nstars is a nation among nations. It\nis a priceless treasure-house of art,\nculture and tradition, the beauty and\ndiversity of which is evident from\nthe Vedic temples in South India\nand monuments like the Taj Mahal\nwhose beauty is known all over the\nworld in North India from the times\nof the Mughols. Thousand year old\nsculptures and carvings, which\nrepresented at the time, the faith and\nfeeling of those who executed them\nand which still retain their original\nimpression to this day.\nBeauty of India is not only in its\ndiversity of culture and humans but\nalso it geography. It is contained by\nthe Himalayas that guard it in the\nnorth east and Hindu Khush on the\nnorth west. From the Pamir Knot\nand beautiful snow covered ranges\ndominated by the Karakoram, the\nHimilayas curve eastwards like a gigantic curtain to the junction of\nChina and Burma.\nImperial College Indian Society\nwas set up for the purpose of\nbringing the Indians closer to their\nroots and exposing the non-Indians\nto beauty of the diverse Indian\nnation. This is ex acd y what the\ncommittee of this year has been\ntrying to do through organisation of\ncultural events. Our major event\nwas in December 1992 on the\noccasion of 'Divali' the Indian\nfestival of lights. Our other efforts\nhave been trips to the\nCommonwealth Institute, the Indian\nexhibition at the Victoria and Albert\nMuseum and a colourful exhibition\nof Indian art, food and clothes\nduring the OSC's International\nWeek. We also exploit the excellent\nopportunity during the OSC's International Night to expose a much wider and varied audience to\nIndia through our cultural\nperformance.\nADVERTISEMENT\nVote Ian 'Poddy' Davies for Felix Editor, Print Unit Manager, in all departments 8,9 March.\nThe indisputable top cat.

    "content": "R ag\n5 March 1993 Felix 960\nInvasion of the Comic Tomatoes\nAre you looking for a good excuse\nto wash your hair with baked beans?\nEver wanted to raise money by\ndoing your party trick of cleaning\nyour teeth with the toothbrush held\nbetween your toes? If you have any\nsilly ambitions or ideas that could\npossibly (let's face it, what can't?) be used to raise money for a good\ncause, then now is the time. March\n12th heralds the seventh year of\nComic Relief, and this year has\nbeen named the Invasion of the\nComic Tomatoes - this would\nexplain why the red noses now on\nsale from various places round\ncollege have strange little green bits\non the front! You have probably\nseen the lit-up splat on the front of\nthe Natural History Museum, but\nhave you noticed tomato bike\nreflectors? Totally Red packets of\nM& Ms? Red Nose Sleepwalker\ncomputer game? Even Global\nHypercolor tomato t shirts,\navailable from C&A! These are just\nDoing\nThe\nDirty\nYet again, teams of twelve vicious\nr aggies will be hitting various\nlocations and raising hell whilst\nraising money. There is little to\nreport since last week, but for your\ninformation here is a quick resume e of who is going where: Falmouth\nKeogh are heading off to Guildford\nto collect for the Leonard Cheshire\nFoundation; Bernard Sunley are\nheading for the QPR v Norwich\nmatch, collecting for WWF N; Willis Jackson are going to Reading\nin aid of WWF N, and Garden,\nWeeks, Tizard and Southwell are\nall staying in London.\nUnfortunately, Linstead and Selkirk\ndo not seem to be able to muster\ntwelve people for a team. Shame on\nyou! However, any of you lot from\nthe decent halls can run along to\nyour hall reps and beg to be\nincluded in a team. Good luck! and\nmay the best dozen win.\na few of the ways that cash is being\nraised for Comic Relief this year.\nCue the serious bit - Comic Relief\nis not just about doing silly things\nand having fun. The money raised\ngoes towards a huge variety of\nprojects both abroad and at home.\nJust to give you some idea: in the\npast, grants in Arica have helped to\nprovide emergency food, medicines\nand shelter as well as long term\nprojects such as developing better\ncrop strains, controlling soil erosion\nand translating health manuals into\nlocal languages; in the UK, on the\nother hand, Comic Relief grants\nhave paid for work with young\npeople who are homeless, or who\nhave problems with drugs and\nalcohol, plus sheltered housing for\npensioners.\nSo, grab a nose, think of\nsomething silly and come along to\nthis week's Rag meeting to find out\nmore. Failing all these, if you are\na resident of Falmouth Keogh you\ncan still have fun and support\nSplatic Relief by joining the hall\nparty on Friday 12th, all proceeds\nto Comic Relief. There will be\ncocktails and casino, and entry is\nfree. What more could you desire?!\nFrom\n7 0 pA \u2022\nthe\nUnion Office\nHave you been stung?\nFREE concert\ntickets\nstill\navailable\ncontact LORNA\nin Rag Office (8214)\nor come to Rag\nmeeting Friday\n1.00pm Union\nLounge\nRaid\nNow available from the RAG Office! Entrance to the Royal\nAlbert Hall to watch Sting concerts\non Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,\nFriday and Saturday the week\nbeginning 7th March. There are\nplaces for ten collectors each night,\nalthough we can't actually\nguarantee that everybody will get in\nto see the concert. Anyone that has\never collected at the Proms will\nknow how easy it is, though -just smile at the Stewards and you\ncan probably nab yourself a seat in\na doorway! All those eager people\nwho signed up at last week's meeting will be given priority; can\nthese and anybody else wanting a place please come along to the RAG\nmeeting this lunchtime at 1.10pm, Union lounge.\nHeave Ho\nDo you want to break records AND\nbe on TV? Do you want to pull\nthree planes? Join the Greater\nLondon Fund for the Blind in\npulling a jet, Concorde and a Jumbo\njet at three different airports on the\nsame day. All you need to do is\nraise \u00a3250 sponsorship (or \u00a3500 if\nyou are a team of three) and collect\na form from the RAG office.\nNext Saturday, the 13th of March,\nsees yet another Rag Raid. This\ntime we will be joining Rags from\nExeter and Bristol universities in a brave attempt to win a barrel of\nbeer.\nThe collection will be in aid of the\nWorld Wildlife Fund for Nature\n(W.W.F.), and will happen in\nBristol. The collection will take\nplace in - yes, you guessed it -Bristol, and the barrel of beer will\nbe awarded to the Rag raising over\n\u00a31000. Food will almost certainly\nbe provided and the transport will\nbe free, so there are no excuses for\nnot going! Anybody interested in\ngetting away from the Big Smoke\nfor a day and winning a part-share\nin a barrel of beer should either sign\nup during the Rag meeting at\n1:00pm today (Friday) or in the Rag\noffice at any time.\nPage 6\nADVERTISEMENT\nVote Ian 'Poddy' Davies for Felix Editor, Print Unit Manager, in all departments 8,9 March.\nWouldn't be seen dead in yellow.\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs & Societies\nFelix 960 5 March 1993\nNeo-Tokyo Explodes\nICSC, in association with the Japan\nSociety, is pleased to present its\ncyberpunk film evening on Monday\nnight. The evening starts at 6pm with a special widescreen (and\nsubtitled) showing of the first full-length animated Manga feature to\nreach these shores, Akira. In\nAD2019 Neo-Tokyo, Japan, a young boy called Tetsuo naturally\ndevelops unusual telekinetic\npowers, through which he gets\ninvolved in a secret military\noperation. Thirty years earlier,\nevents surrounding a similarly\ngifted boy by the name of Akira led\nto an explosion of nuclear\nproportions. As Tetsuo's powers\ndevelop, so does his psychosis as he\ngoes out of control, leading to a final confrontation between Tetsuo\nand Akira who has been kept in\nstasis away from the outside world.\nMeanwhile, the military bosses\ntrying to contain Tetsuo's rage have\nto contend with a traitor in their\nmidst, trying to ignite a revolution.\nThe animation in the film is\nextraordinary and unlike that seen\nanywhere else, while the\noutstanding script also bears little\nresemblance to any of the standard\nexamples of cyberpunk that western\nscience fiction has produced.\nThe other film of the evening,\nwhich starts at 8.20pm, is\nHardware. The film is British, was\ninspired by a story in '2000AD' magazine, is very low budget (don't worry, though, this doesn't show)\nand is occasionally reminiscent of\n\"The Terminator', in that the action\nrevolves around a robot\nprogrammed to kill. There,\nhowever, the similarities end, as the\nHAIRDRESSERS\n15A HARRINGTON ROAD,\nSOUTH KENSINGTON0718238968 We have a fantastic offer for all you\nstudents, a cut wash and blow dry by our top stylist\n(which normally costs around \u00a321)\nFor only \u00a311 Men \u00a312 Women\nCheck us out !\n'Mark 13' robot in Hardware is\nactually a population control device,\nintended to kill virtually anyone it\ncomes into contact with.\nMysteriously discovered in the\ndesert, parts of the robot are given\nby a trader dying from nuclear\ncontamination to his gM friend.. The\nrobot starts to repair itself and sets\nout on a murderous rampage to\nfulfil its mission. The movie has\nbeautiful photography, much in the\ntradition of Bladerunner, as turin ing soundtrack of British rock and a fleeting cameo by Iggy Pop.\nEntry to both films is FREE to all\nmembers of both the Japan Society\nand ICSF, and there is also an\nopportunity to join either (or both)\nof the clubs, ICSF membership is\njust \u00a33 and the show starts at 6pm in Chem Eng LT1 on Monday the\n8th. Proud to be a part of Mines\nin my capacity as the RSMU Sports\nOfficer I would like to say a few\nwords about this weekend. First of\nall, for any of you who dont know,\nwe lost; Squash 0-5, Ladies Hockey\n0-1, Men's Hockey 0-3, Football\n1-3, and the Bottle Match 3-7. To\nanyone who didn't see any of the\nmatches, this may sound pretty\nhorrendous, but anyone who was at\nHarlington on Saturday, and many\nthanks to those who were, will\nappreciate that nothing was given\naway by any of the RS M teams.\nThere has been the usual complaints\nabout the lack of sports facilities,\nthe use of ringers, dod gy decisions\netc, but it doesn't do any good or\nchange the results. All that can be\nsaid is that, despite the tremendous\nefforts of all the squads (note squad,\nnot team), we were unlucky and\nCamborne had the better teams on\nthe day. On top of that, the matches\nwere played in good spirit and we'\nwere admirable in defeat, resulting\nin very little trouble at the dinner\nor int he bar. On this basis, I can\nsay that after this weekend I am\nproud to wear an RSM Hockey shirt\nand am proud to be part of the\nRoyal School of Mines.\nFinally, there are a few people I would like to thank. Paul Holmes,\nGina Mortley, Rick Bilby and all\nthe squad captains for their help and\nsupport. Greg Rule (for picking me\nfor the hockey team), Prof Shaw\n(Dean of RSM) for his timely\nintervention, Felix printing unit,\nand Tiggy, for putting up with me!\nPS congratulations to Boris\nPlukowski (Man of the Bottle\nMatch)!\nADVERTISEMENT\nVote Ian 'Poddy' Davies for Felix Editor, Print Unit Manager, in all departments 8,9 March.\nClose friends get to call him TC.

    "content": "opinion\nFelix 960 5 March 1993\nWest Fights Back Euroshopping\nDear Jonty,\nMr Abdullah in the last issue of\nFelix offered us some criticisms of\nWestern Civilisation. Although his\nreligious fer v our was impressive,\nhis attempt to enlighten us as to how\nIslam is superior to the Western\n(Christian) Civilisations is not such\na 'not-so-long established tree' as\nMr Abdullah might think. The tree\nhas its roots in Ancient Greece and\nRome and has been growing for at\nleast 25 centuries, bearing copious\nfruit, beginning with philosophy of\nPlato and Aristotle, through St\nThomas Aquinas' thought,\nmediaeval Gothic architecture,\nShakespeare's poetry in\nRenaissance, all the way to the\ntwentieth century with phenomena\nsuch as Picasso's art or Gershwin's music.\nSecondly, I think that Mr Abdullah should understand, that\none shouldn't criticise a culture by\nconfusing it with the government.\nLast week we were given some\nhorrible statistics concerning British\nsociety (high crime rate, poverty,\netc) and the blame was put on the\nWestern culture (incidentally, I would be interested to see the\nsources of those statistics).\nIn the same way, one could offer\nsome drastic examples taken from\nthe world of Islam. Saudi Arabia\nInternational\nNight\nDear Jonty,\nI write in today looking back at\nlast year's International Nite. A tremendous effort and a marvellous\nperformance, but sadly the purpose\nof spreading the cultures of the\nworld was not fully achieved. I say\nthis with regard to the small number\nof home students present at last\nyear's event.\nOne glance at the crowd present\nwould tell you that it was almost\nentirely a 'foreign affair'. That was\nnot the intention at all. We did not\ncome from all corners of the world\njust to see what we already know,\nwe came to learn and also to share.\nIn just one night we hope to share\na lot with you, please don't waste\nthis effort.\nAround the world people long for\ncultural diversity, longing to know\nand to learn of the world around\nthem and here at IC with over\ntwenty overseas societies I find it\nstrange that these are people who\nformally abolished slavery only in\nthe 1960s, and reports of the\npractice still occur in some nomadic\nArab tribes, where boys are said to\nsell for $240, girls for $160. One\ncould argue here, that it is the\nWestern ideas of equality that\ncontributed to the abolition of\nslavery in many parts of the world.\nThe Koran stipulates that 'men\nhave authority over women because\nAllah has made the one superior to\nthe other'. The renowned Islamic\nscholar Ibn Taymiyya advises,\n'When a husband beats his wife for\nmisbehaviour, he should not exceed\nten lashes.'Many of non-Western\ncultures have deeply ingrained ideas\nof male superiority, and phenomena\nlike emancipation of women are\nsimply not in dig i nous to non-Western cultures.\nThe above examples were not\nmeant to offend the Muslim\ncommunity, but to point out to the\nauthor of the letter 'How to save\nyour soul', Mr Abdullah, that\nattacks on the Western heritage are\nnot the best idea, if one wishes to\nmake Islam more attractive to the\nWesterners. Understanding, rather\nthan confrontation should be the\ngoal.\nSincerely,\nLM Urban, Biochemistry.\ndon't know how lucky they are.\nI wrote in after last year's International Night and have\nprobably repeated myself here but\nI guess I was a little too late then.\nWith a food fair and cultural show\nfollowed by a disco and live band\nyou have everything to gain. Don't give this year's show a miss, please.\nSang Ratnam, Civ Eng 2.\nDear Jonty,\nI read with interest the article in\nFelix 958 on 'Europshopping', and\nas a seasoned day trip per would\noffer the following tips in addition\nto the article.\nTo save money on the crossing,\nwithout having to buy crap\nnewspapers, join the 'Ferry Travel\nClub'. This is operated by The\nTravel Market Ltd., Channel View\nRoad, Dover, Kent CT16 1XJ( Tel\n(0304) 213533). It costs \u00a35 per year\nmembership, and you can travel on\ntheir special offers as many times\nas you like. The current offer (until\nApril 2nd) allows foot passengers\nto travel for \u00a31. A car with up to\n5 people costs just \u00a325 (with a supplement of \u00a315 if you go on a Saturday). They also offer discounts\non standard ferry rates for holidays,\nand several short breaks.\nContinental breakdown insurance\nand medical cover is available for\n\u00a36.\nTake the car, bring back loads of\nbooze, and avoid the back strain.\nYou can also drive to Bologne and\nshop at the 'Auchan' hypermarket\nwhich is bigger (but busier) that\nthose in Calais. Bologne is also a nicer town that Calais.\nIf you (and the car!) can stand\nDear Jonty,\nWe would like to clear up some\nof the rumours that have been\ncirculating about Linstead Hall Bar\nlast week. As you may be aware,\nthe Bar was closed on Monday night\nafter the powers that be at Sherfield\nsaid there was an error in our\naccounting procedure. This was\nimmediately found to be a gross\nexaggeration and one that we see as\nyet another attempt by catering\nmanagement and in particular\nSimon Westerman, to disrupt the\nrunning of Linstead Hall Bar.\nSimon Westerman has stated that\nhe wishes to see the closure of our\nBar. Could these recent events have\nbeen a thinly veiled attempt by\ncatering to start the shutdown of,\nnot only our Bar, but also those of\nWeeks and Beit Halls and, in fact,\nany service which does not fall\nunder their monopoly? What do\nthey hope to gain by the closure of\na Bar which is the heart and soul of\nLinstead Hall? Apart from the\ndisastrous effect that this would\nhave on a very social Hall, can\nSimon Westerman really be so\nnaive as to think that a turnover of\njust \u00a320,000 pa (of which only a small amount is profit) could in any\ndriving about laden, then stock up\nas soon as you get there and avoid\nthe afternoon scramble. The car\nalso allows you to get off the beaten\ntrack into a village for lunch\u2014you\ncan try your fractured French here\nas they won't speak English.\nDon't overload the car, as the\nKent Police are very keen on\nweighing cars as well as coaches,\nand it would be a shame to have to\ngive you booze to them.\nRemember that you are only\npermitted to bring back sealed meat\nand dairy products, so don't get\ncarried away at the Deli counters.\nPay for the booze etc by credit\ncard\u2014the rates are usually better\nthan cash exchange. Club together\nwith friends when changing money\nand avoid excessive commission\ncharges.\nDon't be tempted by mains\noperated electrical goods, as these\nare designed mainly for 220V, and\nmay not be guaranteed safe at\n240V. You may also have difficult\nif the thing goes wrong.\nI hope these will be of some use.\nGive it a try\u2014it can be great fun and\na very cheap way to get tanked up.\nYours faithfully,\nJason Brameld, ex Physics.\nway alleviate catering services'\npresent difficulties?\nThe events of the last few days\nhave, for the moment, been\namicably resolved. However, you\ncan surely appreciate our anxiety\nthat there may be a recurrence of\nthis situation.

    "content": "'eat ure5 March 1993 Felix 960\nGreece\nThere's more to Greece than Shirley Valentine and Stavros, examine the\nreal history of Greece below.\nGreece is a country of the North\nEastern Mediterranean with 10\nmillion inhabitants for an area of\n51,000 sq miles. It has 3,100\nislands, which extend throughout\nthe Aegean Sea, to the East and\nSouth of the mainland, and part of\nthe Ionian Sea, which separates\nGreece from Italy to the West.\nAthens is the capital city, as it\nused effectively to be during the\ngolden era of the Classical Greek\nperiod (7th4 th century BC). At that\ntime it shared supremacy with\nSparta in the Peloponese, less\nfamous for its cultural heritage than\nfor its Constitution, the nearest\napproach to Plato's political ideal,\nand, above all, the courage and\nsacrifice of its soldiers (Leonidas\nand the battle he delivered with his\nthree hundred men against tens of\nthousands of Persians at\nThermopylae gave Greece a defeat\nso glorious it is still remembered\nafter 2,500 years). Today, Salonica,\nthe capital city of the region of\nMacedonia, which spans most of\nnorthern Greece, is the second most\nimportant city.\nEvery country has at least one\nperiod of its history which it is\nparticularly proud of; Greece has at\nleast two.\nThe first starts with the Minoan\nCivilisation (Crete from 3,000 BC)\nand Mycenae (Peleponese 1,600\nBC). A time so remote and so grand\nthat Homer's descriptions were\nthought to be an elaborate legend,\nuntil excavations at the end of the\n19th century revealed that Troy had\nreally existed and had been captured\nby a supreme civilisation. The\npalace of Minos in Crete was also\nuncovered.\nThis age ended some 3,000 years\nlater, after having given birth to the\nmathematicians Euclid and Thales,\nthe scientists Archimedes and\nAristarchus, the philosophers\nSocrates, Plato and Aristotle, the\nplaywrights Aeschylus and\nSophocles, the historians Plutarch\nand Herodotus, the statesmen Solon\nand Pericles, and countless others.\nAlthough Greece had known\nabsolute military, economic and\npolitical supremacy, at a time when\nSouthern Italy and Asia Minor (now\nTurkey) and, under Alexander the\nGreat (4th century BC), Persia,\nEgypt, India and what is now\nAfghanistan were co'on is ed, this is\nnot its main legacy. What was left\nbehind were ideas, words, a powerful language and an ideal of\nbeauty and reason.\nEven though sciences like\nchemistry and medicine, and arts\nsuch as painting and music had\nexisted from the dawn of mankind,\nthe Greeks endowed them with the\ntheoretical structures necessary for\ntheir progress. Their way of\nthinking in Mathematics is the only\none which is of any use in modern\ntimes (Euclidean Geometry,\ntrigonometry); Hippocrates was the\nfirst physician to attempt an\nexplanation of the workings of the\nbody and to establish a code of\nmedical ethics, still largely followed\nin our day.\nSculpture reached unsurpassed\nnaturalistic expression of the human\nbody, imitated again in Europe\nduring the Renaissance, whilst\narchitectural forms of the time are\nstill today's paradigms.\nAlthough the oldest littera ry text\nwas probably Assyrian, Homer,\nPindar and their many successors\ndefined by their works the epic, the\node, the elegy, the comedy, the\ntragedy, i.e. the fundamental poetic\nand theatrical genres.\nAristotle is today considered not\nonly an early physicist but also the\nforefather of classical biology, and\nDemocritus the founder of the\natomic theory.\nThe importance of this age cannot\nbe overstated: Greeks themselves\nare often surprised at the amount of\nGreek mythology and philosophy\ninterspersed in the books and works\nof art of all later times, or to see,\nwhen walking in London some\nchurch built like an ancient Greek\ntemple.\nThis era ended with Roman\ninvasion in 145BC but, two hundred\nyears later, the Christian Era started\nunder wonderful auspices. Saint\nPaul taught the Macedonians, the\nAthenians and the Corinthians, and\nall the New Testament except St\nMatthew's Gospel was originally\nwritten in Greek. Constantinople\n(Byzantium) was founded in the\nyear 330 AD, in aug rua ting a new\nperiod of might for the Greeks,\nsince Constantine's Eastern Roman\nEmpire was, by the year 480,\ncompletely hellen is ed. The latin\nWestern Roman Empire soon\ncrumbled under the barbarian\ntribes' invasions, but the Eastern\n(Byzantine) Empire lasted for\nanother thousand years, until\nConstantinople fell to the Turks in\n1453.\nThough it was a mediaeval\nChristian empire (of Orthodox\ncreed, like today's Greece) the auto-da-fes of Catholic France and Italy\nand, later, Spain, England and the\nProtestant Switzerland, were never\nto be found there. Theological\narguments were concluded in\nrhetorical jousts and many western\ntravellers were surprised to see the\npreponderant place of women in\nthat society.\nUntil the crusades of the 13th century, no western kingdom was\ncomparable in power and wealth to\nthe Byzantine Empire.\nAfter a very long period of\nTurkish occupation, from 1453\nuntil the Greek Revolution of 1821,\nwhich led to the proclamation of the\nmodern Hellenic state, Greece\nPage 12\nADVERTISEMENT\nVote Ian 'Poddy' Davies for Felix Editor, Print Unit Manager, i My pussy purrs when he's around.\nall departments 8,9 March.\n\n"

She\nREALLY can act, along with Peter\nand the rest of the cast. The only\nimperfection that let the side down\nwas with the voice of Nigel\nDavenport, who sounded like a northerner with a throat infection,\ndoing a bad ' Milky Milky' impression.\nAnna Karenina If you ever managed to read the\nbook, then go to this performance\nand indulge. If you haven't read it,\nthen see the play instead - and\nindulge as well. This theatre\nadaptation of Anna Karenina is very\nspecial and in many ways more\ncomprehensive than the usual,\nconcentrating on the inner life and\ndevelopment -rather than just an\no udine of the plot- not only of Anna\nherself but also Lewin who is\ncommonly ignored in other\nadaptations. Although Anna and\nLewin only meet once, quite to the\nend, they communicate with each\nother through the whole play telling\neach other what they experience.\nThe whole production succeeds\nwith only a few props and a very\nsimple scenery. The acting has a strong expression ali stic influence,\nThe story was nothing short of\nfantastically amazing, although I did\nguess whodunnit about half an hour\nfrom the end. But as usual, Aggie\nmakes you change your mind about\nwhodunnit every time the scene\nchanges, and the sets for each scene\nare amazingly fantastic.\nMore atmospheric than the film\n(so I'm told) and with an edge of\nseat finale, this has to be a must for\nlovers of murder/mysteries.\nHarry\n\u2022 Duke of York, St.Martin's Lane WC2, Leicester Sq.

Kitty\nand especially Seriozha (both\nJessica Lloyd) were expressed with\nthe help of mime. Anna (Teresa\nBanham), Lewin (Richard Hope),\nand Karenin (David Fielder) all\nperformed extremely well.\nHowever, also the rest of the cast\nacts not badly but for the widow of\nthe railway man who was too\nhistrionic. The Shared Experience\nTheatre Company presented a exceedingly well set up\nperformance which is very much\nworth seeing.\nEnitsirk\n\u2022 Tricycle Theatre, 269 Kilburn\nHigh Road, NW6, Kilburn tube.\nBox Office 074-328 1000.

Opera\nTurandot Set in ancient China Princess\nTorandot is a bitter passionless\nwoman since an ancestor was\nravished and killed by an invader,\nand has sworn that no man shall\npossess her. Unfortunately the\nemperor is just about to snuff it and\nwants her to rule with a husband.\nDespite this she has many suitors,\nwhose only chance is to answer\ncorre cd y three riddles but if they get\none wrong they get their heads\nchopped off.\nThe exiled Prince Calaf turns up\nand guess what? He falls madly in\nlove with her. Everyone including\nhis Dad's slave girl (who is secretly\nin love with Calaf, herself) tries to\ndissuade him but in the end he\ncorrectly answers the riddles but\nbeing a gambling addict gives her\nanother chance to chop his head off.\nIf she can find out his name by\ndawn he's lost. Being a bloodthirsty\nold cow she won't let anyone sleep\nuntil she discovers it (Nessun\nDorma). She even tries torturing\nhim but she tops herself rather than\ntell (but...young love). Then Calaf\ngives Turandot a good s nog and\nwhispers his name to her. After all\nthis (and reading her Cosmo) her\nheart melts and at dawn she tells\neveryone his name is love.\nIf you can afford it see it for if\nnothing else the sets, costumes and\nChinese dancing.

For while Singaporeans\nhave an innate sense of national\npride, they also have cultural roots\nwhich stretch beyond the island\nrepublic's borders to India,\nMalaysia, China, even Portugal.\nThe traditions brought to\nSingapore by its adventurous early\nsettlers did not wilt in foreign soil.\nInstead, they flourished in a supportive climate, with the result\nthat the fabric of Singapore's society is woven from many multicultural threads.\nSingapore is renowned for its\nyear-round calendar of festivals\nwhich bring additional colour and\nlife to this already bustling tropical\nisland. Just to mention a few, the\nfollowing are celebrated by the\nvarious races, cultures and\nreligions.\nThe Dragon Boat Festival is\ntraditionally celebrated on the fifth\nday of the fifth lunar month. In\nSingapore, it has become an\ninternational event with teams from\nall over the world converging to\ncontest the world Invitational\nDragon Boat Race.\nDragon boat crews vie with one\nanother for line honours and\nvaluable prizes, in the colourful, and\nnoisy, spectacle that is enormously\npopular with both spectators and\ncompetitors alike.\nOn the water, the pounding of\ndrums and the chanting of crews fill\nthe air, while on land, the tempting\nsmells of steaming-hot rice\ndump jing s and other traditional\nseasonal delicacies distract\nrace-watchers.\nThe festival honours Qu Yuan, an\nancient Chinest poet who was a loyal minister of state and became\nmost disturbed by the corruption\nassociated with court intrigues.\nDeciding death was preferable to\ndishonour, he clasped a large stone\nto himself and jumped into the\nriver. Tradition has it that fishermen\ndesperately tried to save him,\nthrashing the water with their oars\nto drive off the fish and sea dragons\nbut their efforts were in vain.\nOn the anniversaries of his death,\nrice was scattered into the water by\nthe townsfolk to feed Qu Yuan's Haw Par Villa, a Chinese mythological theme park\nSingapore's history is one of riches\nand romance, spice trading and\npiracy, colonialism and growth. In\nthe 7th century, she was Temasek,\nthe trading centre of Sumatra's ancient Srivijaya empire.\nBy the 13th century, she had a new name, Singapura, meaning\n'Lion City'. The name came from\nSang Nila Utama, Prince of\nPalembang, who reported seeing an\nanimal 'very swift and beautiful, its\nbody bright red, its head jet black.'\nClearly, the Prince was no\nzoologist, for the beast was\nprobably a tiger. But he obviously\nhad a way with words, and the 13th century name remains today.\nA century later, Singapura\nbecame the centre of a fierce\nstruggle between Java, Siam and the\nChinese led by Admiral Cheng Ho.\nAs is often the case in war, no clear\nvictor emerged and Singapore was\nthe main victim. Abandoned by the\nfighting factions, its buildings were\nreclaimed by the jungle, to stay\nhidden until the 1800s. Singapore was resettled in 1811\nby 100 Malays, led by their local\nchief, the Temmenggong. Eight\nyears later, Sir Stamford Raffles\nstepped ashore on the banks of\nSingapore River and decided that,\nlocal pirates notwithstanding,\nSingapore would be the ideal site\nfor the British trading base.\nFor 110 years Singapore boomed\nwith Raffles' vision of a free port\nbecoming reality and the island\nbecoming an Asian promised land\nto many immigrants whose hard\nwork ensured their personal dreams\nwould come true.\nIn 1965, Singapore became an\nindependent republic. Over 28\nyears Singapore has relentlessly\npursued the goal of becoming\nAsia's pre-emin ant centre for\ntourism, trade and finance, by\ndeveloping education and technical\ntraining programmes, investment\nstrategies, aviation and\nenvironmental policies.\nNow the small island republic of\nonly 633 square kilometres, boasts\none of the world's busiest ports and\nan airport served by over 50 of the\nworld's major airlines, serving\nmore than 11 million airline\npassengers a year,\nspirit. This has developed into the\nrice dumpling which is an integral\npart of the festival.\nHaria Raya Puasa is the major\nMuslim festival celebrated in\nSingapore. It marks the end of the\nfasting month of Ramadan, a time\nof strict observances by Muslim\nfamilies.\nRamadan ends with special\nprayers and the gathering of\nfamilies all over Singapore.\nDressed in new clothing, Muslims\neverywhere celebrate with feasting\nand visiting friends and relatives.\nA celebration of good over evil,\nDeepavali, or the Festival of Lights,\nis especially significant to\nSingapore's Indian community.\nThe triumph of light over dark is\nreflected in the lighting of oil lamps\nand coloured lights at homes.\nVisitors to an Indian family will find\nPage 14\nADVERTISEMENT\nVote Ian 'Poddy' Davies for Felix Editor, Print Unit Manager, in all departments 8,9 March.\nA character with interesting Features.\n\n"

For the\npurposes of Imperial College\nUnion, these events are staged at\nlocations within St Mary's in\nPaddington, and Imperial College\nin South Kensington. The St Mary's hustings, coinciding with St Mary's Union Rag Week activities, took\nplace on Tuesday evening at Wilson\nHouse in Paddington.\nAfter what initially appeared to\nbe high spirits on the part of the St\nMary's crowd, proceedings\ncontinued with heckling the\ncandidates. The first of whom was\nPresidential nominee Rachel\nMountford. Her proposer, Nicky\nFox, had been taken ill, so Miss\nMountford asked Mr Steven\nNewhouse to stand in and introduce\nher. This he did and was summarily\nflan ned, as was Miss Mountford\nherself.\nMuch political capital is made of\nSt Mary's legendary 'block vote',\nwith the more charismatic candidate\nat the hustings generally being the\nrecipient of this en masse support.\nRecent candidates to benefit from\nthis include Paul Shanley (President\n1990-91) and the current President,\nMr Chris Davidson. However,\nMiss Mountford, when addressing\nthis issue early on, was greeted with\njeers and shouts of 'What block\nvote?'. Her opponent, Mr Andrew\nWensley, appeared well adapted to\nthe prevailing atmosphere.\nHugh Eland, standing for Deputy\nPresident, suffered from a distinct\namount of spoiling from the\naudience. David Goddard, also\nstanding for Deputy President,\nfared little better against the crowd,\nwith his proposer, Sarah McCarthy\nreceiving verbal sexual abuse from\nsome Mary's students present. The\nonly candidate for the position of\nHonorary Secretary (Events),\nMaxim Jalil, appearing to all but\nlose his temper as he struggled\nagainst the audience. By\ncomparison, the Felix Editor\ncandidates Ian Davies and Rebecca\nLand were treated lightly.\nThe only person involved to\nescape any bar racking was Marc\nSwan, St Mary's President. When\ninterviewed by i CNN afterwards,\nChairman of the hustings, Dominic\nWilkinson, said that it was a 'Farce,\nfiasco, pointless, completely\ncontradictory to the point of a hustings', adding that he intends to\nwrite to the Dean of St Mary's, Professor Peter Richards,\nexplaining what had occurred and\nrecommending that St Mary's are\nnever allowed to host a hustings\nagain.\nBy contrast, the Imperial College\ncampus hustings held in the Union\nBuilding's Entertainments Lounge\nyesterday evening were a largely\nsober affair, with all candidates\nbeing given every opportunity to\nspeak. One candidate even\nproposed a minute's silence for\nBobby Moore. The highlights of\nthis event were the easy ride given\nto Presidential candidates, and\nconversely, the difficult time given\nto Maxim Jalil, Ian Davies and\nRebecca Land by the questioners.\nDominic Wilkinson said later it was\n'How a hustings should be run'.\nNTER NATION A LN\nI GH TS\nPE CIA "

Read how the modern Japan\nlives, below\nUntil 1854, Japan had enjoyed a wonderful time in isolation from the\nrest of the world. It was a very\ntraditional country, with a strong\nfear of foreigners. Based on the\nfeudal system of ancient Japan, the\nJapanese were brought up to respect\nand have the sense of loyalty to their\n'Lord'. At the same time it was\nnecessary to have honour among\ntheir peers.\nThe colourful part of Japan has\ngiven rise to unique art forms\nranging from the famous tea\nceremony to exquisite flower\narranging. This was separated by\nsome bloody civil wars which have\nled to the highly disciplined and\nextremely sophisticated martial arts.\nEach of these form are very\ncomplex, requiring spiritual\n'karma', meditation and many\nhighly ritual is ed techniques. The\nJapanese have a number of\nun transl a table words which\ndescribe their concept of beauty.\nOne example is the word 's abi' which literally means loneliness,\nand conveys a pleasurable sense of\nthe old, the faded, and the slightly\nmelancholy.\nShinto, Japan's ancient\nindigenous religion, is a form of\nnature worship. It was at first\nnameless but came to be called\n'Shinto' to distinguish it from\nBuddhism. The name is of Chinese\norigin, and means the 'Way of the\nGods'. Shinto has many deities\nknown as kami. According to\nShinto belief, the emperor is divine.\nThe gods are rarely represented in\nhuman form. They are symbolised\nin the shrines by objects such as\nmirrors or swords. Shinto offers no\nphilosophical system or moral code,\nbut places great emphasis on\nfertility and ritual purity.\nBuddhism was introduced to\nJapan from China in 552 A.D. By\nthe seventh century several sects\nwere established; and by the ninth,\nBuddhism had greatly influenced\nJapanese culture. It adopted many\nnative gods and beliefs from Shinto.\nThe two which are strongest today,\nJodo (Pure Land) and Shinshi (True\nSect) were founded in the twelfth\ncentury. Zen Buddhism, also from\nthe twelfth century, took root\namong the 'samurai'. It emphasises\nself discipline. Zen means\n'meditation' but Zen philosophy is\nnot opposed to action. Typical Zen\nart forms are the raked garden of\n, carefully chosen rocks in a sea of\nraked white sand, and the\nimpressionistic landscape painting\nperfected by the fifteenth century\nartist, Sesshu.\nThe Japanese on the whole have\nbeen aggressive towards foreigners.\nThis can be seen through early\nmodern history and its remnants can\nstill be seen today. This was\nbrought about by the fear of foreign\ninterference. The realisation that\nJapan was an insignificant player in\nthe world caused huge social and\nindustrial changes. Japan has been\neager to adopt new ideas and\nreluctant to do away with traditional\nvalues. This can be seen by the\ninitial Japanese military expansion\nand after the defeat in the second\nworld war, a huge increase in\neconomic activity.\nThe modern Japanese have a similar attitude to that of traditional\nJapan but modified for the new era.\nThe 'Lord' has been replaced by the\n'Company'. Like before, self\nesteem didn't matter on what your\njob was but who you worked for.\nAlthough Japan has very few\nnatural resources, it has flourished\nindustrially by concentrating on\nimproving on previous industrial\nand technological advances. Her\nproducts range from the modern\nmicro stereo system to super\ntankers.\nThe Japanese have a very strong\nfamily bond. They have a fairly\nextended family where the elders\nare respected and looked after by\nthe younger members. Individual\nprivacy is not highly valued and\nchildren are brought up in an\natmosphere of intimacy. This is\nenhanced by the fact that many live\nin very small flats, which in a ADVERTISEMENT\nVote Ian 'Poddy' Dayies for Felix Editor, Print Unit Manager, in all departments 8,9 March.\nIrritation not imitation.\n\n"

Because Cyrpus\ninspires the love of all who visit.\nCyprus is the third largest island\nin the the Mediterranean. It has a mediterranean climate and the\natmosphere and architecture of its\ntowns and villages is decidedly\nGreek, but with a strong hint of the\nEast. Virtually all the ancient\ncivilisations met at this crossroads\nof Europe, Asia, Africa and Asia\nMinor and its rich cultural heritage\nis loaded with myth and legend and\na supreme legacy of archeological\nsites.\nCyprus history can be traced back\nto the time of Neolothic man in\n7,000 BC. The island's name in\nGreek is 'Kypros'. The island's goddess Afrodite was known as\n'ki pris' in Greek. The island gave\nalso its name to 'k up rum' the latin\nword for copper after the vital\ndiscovery of significant copper\ndeposits in Cyprus. News of this\ngreat fortune brought visitors in\ndroves, some to trace and some to\nstart a new life. It was during this\nperiod that main la in d Greeks settled\nin Cyprus and hellen is ed the island.\nFrom those ancient times the\ncountry has retained its Greek\nheritage, its language, traditions and\nway of life.\nThe island's position was such\nthat for the next 27 centuries it was\ninvaded and ruled by more than a dozen different masters. After\nseveral years of struggle for\nindependence, Cyprus was\ndeclared, through the Zurich\nagreement, an Independent\nRepublic in 1960. In July 1974 a coup was staged in Cyprus by the\nMilitary Junta (then in power in\nAthens) and this was followed by\na Turkish invasion (20th July 1974).\nSince then 37% of the island has\nbeen under Turkish military\noccupation and 200,000 Greek\nCypriots (40% of the total Greek\nCypriot population) have become\nrefugees.\nWith such a historic and\nlegendary background it is hardly\nsurprising that Cyprus has\ndeveloped a character which is quite\nunique. It is blessed with beauty-natural beauty that ranges from\ngolden beaches and rugged\ncoastlines to rolling hills and forest\nclad mountains, dotted with\npicturesque villages.\nThe climate of Cyprus never fails\nto delight her visitors, and every\nseason has a charm and beauty of\nits own.\nNicosia or 'Leftkosia' (in Greek)\nis the capital of Cyprus, a status it\nhas enjoyed for 1000 years since the\n10thc entry. Limassoki is the south\ncoast town which is the island's largest seaside resort. Larnaca and\nPaphos are two other seaside resorts\nof Cyprus each having an\nInternational airport.\nThe towns of Cyprus present a modern cosmopolitan at mos here blended with historic buildings and\nancient monuments. Imposing\ncolonial and classic style buildings,\nrub shoulders with well designed\ncontemporary hotels, apartment\nblocks and attractive shopping\nstreets, some narrow and quaint,\nothers thoroughly modern.\nBy contrast, life in villages\nfollows a slower pace, reflecting the\nimportance of agriculture, cottage\nindustry and family ties. Traditional\nflat-roofed village houses made of\nmud brick are a common sight,\nwhite stone-built dwellings with\ntiled roofs can be seen in the\nmountains.\nThe people of Cyprus are\ntraditionally warm and welcoming,\nand consider a visit to their island\nas a compliment\u2014one that's repaid\nwith genuine hospitality, summed\nup in the Greek word Philokenia;\nFriendship towards the guest. Their\nnative tongue is Greek.\nThe pace is leisurely, the people\nkind and helpful, always ready with\na smile.\nThe gastronomic pleasures of\nCyprus includes the famous\n'meze'\u2014meaning mixture. As\nmany as thirty dishes may form the\nmeze\u2014starting with dips, salads,\nand vegetables advancing to hot\ndishes\u2014including such favorites as\nMoussaka and kebabs as well as\ntasty local casseroles, fresh fish and\nchicken\u2014and finishing with sweets\nlike Baklava and lou cou made s. Cyrpus wines, inexpensive and\nplentiful, make a good\naccompaniment to this exotic and\nlingering experience.\nReligion and celebration are\ndeeply entwined and the most\nimportant event in the church\ncalendar is the occasion of Easter.\nAnother popular religious festival\nand one which is unique to Cyprus\nis 'Kataklysmos' meaning the\n'Flood' which coo in cide s with\nPentecost, and is celebrated at\nseaside towns.\nBut festive excuses are not hard\nto find, every village has its\n'pana gyr i' or fair, usually at harvest\ntime. The carnival, chiefly in\nLimassol is cel b rated with parades,\nparties and masked balls, and there\nare cultural festivals in summer\nincluding the ancient Greek Drama\nfestival.\nYet, despite this wealth of\ntreasures and pleasures, the most\nmemorable thing about Cyprus is\nthe warmth of its people\u2014as warm\nas the climate and as delightful as\nits many resorts. But isn't that all\nyou'd expect of an island which has\ngiven centuries to leisure and\npleasure.\nPage 18\nADVERTISEMENT\nVote Ian 'Poddy' Davies for Felix Editor, Print Unit Manager, in all departments 8,9 March.\nNo limits.\n\n"

Mike\nChamberlain\nCat's Eyes\nHon Sec After being Broadsheet editor for a year, Max feels that he is qualified\nto move to the lofty heights of Hon\nSec. With a bland and insipid\nadvertising campaign involving well\nknown works of art, joints,\nfluorescent paper and bolder than\nbold fonts, he hopes to out wit (or\nblind) the competition, of which\nthere is none. Why did you pull out\nCharles? Fear, maybe. Did Max\nand his bunch of heavies in the RCS\noffice put pressure on to lobo to mise you for real if you went ahead an\nstood for Hon Sec?\nAssuming (God forbid) that New\nElection loses in the battle for Hon\nSec, what is the likelihood that Max\nwill get Rachel fred Basset to do\nmost of the job that he was elected\nto do, as he has done with being\nB/s ht editor this year?\nPresident\nWith the qualifications of working\nbehind the bar and being a Maths\nDep Rep (major responsibility -NOT), Andy feels that he can\ncompetently handle the position of\nIC President. Unlike Rachel, who\nwants to adopt ideas that are more\ncollege wide, Andy wants to make\nthe Union building a very nice place\nto work and play in by pouring cash\ninto the toilets and keeping the bar\nprices down; this will ensure the\nvote from the Rugby team (it\nworked for the current President).\nHe and Rachel are very friendly and\neasy to talk to, I 'll give them that.\nBut does Andy know what to do?\nDeputy President\nOtherwise infamous for his soft-focus, baby-cuddling poster\ncampaign, (he denies the allegation\nof having the collagen implants in\nhis lips), David went for the\nalternative type of manifesto. He\nclaims to have sat on a number,\nplanned a career and worked as a Union steward. Which one do you\nthink he is telling the truth about?\nFrom the posters, it is apparent\nthat David has soft skin...it is not,\nhowever, thick. This man is very\ntouchy. For example, when we first\nprinted his proposer's name, and\ngot it ever so sli ghd y wrong, he left\nan attention grabbing message for\nJonty, reminding him of who the\nreal proposer was. He also resented\nquite strongly, the implication that\nhe wanted to spend another year\ndrinking with his RCS buddies. Is\nit true then?\nAny way, I digress. The point is,\nalthough I haven't really spoken to\nHugh that much, I can only judge\nhim on the manifesto; OK, except\nfor the bush-baby description\n(Hugh\u2014shoot your proposer for\nsaying that); and his posters, which\ncertainly are the most original and\ncertainly grabbed my attention more\nthan David's Blatant Engineering\nPloy.\nFelix Editor\nOK. No holds barred. Despite the\nfact that I will have to work with\npossibly one of these two next year,\nI will say what I think.\nFirstly, Poddy. Hmmmmm. He's secretive for one thing. On several\noccasions he has refused to tell me\nwhat his tiny messages mean and\nwhy he calls himself Poddy. He is\nalso extremely argumentative when\nhis journalistic work is criticised.\nFor example, a lovely dispute\nbetween him and Beccy broke out\nlast week, over the fact the she\nclaimed that there were not enough\nmainstream artists on the music\npages and he began to draw up a list\nof what records that were reviewed,\ngot into the charts. This led to a row\nover what is mainstream, at which\npoint I attempted to add fuel to the\nfire in but was prevented by\nPoddy's refusal to accept my\ndefinition of mainstream. A closed\nmind. That's another characteristic\nof Poddy.\nNow Eccy. She has the editorial\nexperience that Poddy lacks\n(HandBook, AP) but she has the\ndisadvantage of knowing Steve\nNewhouse intimately. Poddy, from\nwhat I can conclude from office\ngossip, goes through women like\nmost people go through tissues. I digress again. Leccy offers a more\nlogical layout of Felix while Poddy\noffers one where anything legal\n(bugger morality), gets printed. I would like to see a combination of\nwhat both candidates are offering.\nNew election, possibly?\nBut wait! There is an option!\nWhiskas The Mouse! Definitely\nthe animal for the job.

There is much\nargument as to what may have\ndisappeared or been inserted, like\nfor any other Holy Book.\nApparently some verses 'inspired\nby Satan' were removed after\nGabriel 'himself denied having\nrevealed them, (see 22.51 for\nexperts) and some found missing\nwhen Uthman compiled the Koran\n(the Verse of Stoning\u2014or how to\npunish adultery).\nAnyway, this doesn't tell us if the\nprophet smoked grass or tripped out\non long fasts, as was common in his\nsurroundings and maybe he just 'hit\nlucky' like Moon or Ron Hubbard\ntoday.\nWhat is certain is that many\naspects of his teachings smell like\nrip-offs from the Jewish and\nChristian worlds, with which he\nwas very familiar and in close\ncontact. Have a look at the food\nlaws and Sura 17:23\u201440\n(remember some\nCommandments?).\nBefore I'm tempted to drift all\nover the place, let me say the\nproblem of hallucinating\nprophets/messiahs, lucky dogma\nand incomplete Books of Truth is\ntypical for any religion whose great\nheroes are dead, so no personal\ngrudges are held.\nThis was just to show Islam is not\nterribly rational either compared to\nother monotheistic 'revealed'\nreligions, and that if there is some\nCreator, hell knows what book or\npeople or country he's chosen, or\nwho he wants killed in His name!\nJust to end, here are some\nextracts of the Koran for ignorant\nWesterners like myself:\n'Fight those who do not believe\nin Allah (...) and do not forbid what\nGod and his apostle have forbidden'\n(Sura 9:29).\n'Men have authority over women\nbecause God has made the one\nsuperior to the other (...)' (Sura\n4:31, and see 2:228).\n'Slay the polytheists wherever\nyou find them' (Sura 9:5).\nThanks for the Hindus, Women,\nHumanists and Rushdies of this\nworld. Best wishes for Peace and\nLove.\nViews expressed in this article\nare not necessarily shared by\nFelix or ICU staff.\nADVERTISEMENT\nVote Ian 'Poddy' Davies for Felix Editor, Print Unit Manager, in all departments 8,9 March.\nFloat like a butterfly, sting like a bee.

IC Football\nOur taxi-driven start to the mongrel\ndog of a patched pitch led to the\nlemming of mediocrity playing\nhavoc with our honey-roasted\npeanut of creativity. We didn't play\nwell either cow. The antelopes\nroamed freely in the wide expanses\nof our midfield until the lone wolf\nof opposition huffed and puffed and\nblew our goal down: Our pigs of\ndefence hadn't drunk themselves\nout of the trough of oblivion. Halftime camel 0-1.\nThe aardvark of promise poked\nabout in the ant-hill which was the\nsecond half. The pira h nic jaws of\nour attack then stripped raw the\ndiplodocus of their defence and\nswiftly took the lead. The yellow\nduck of inevitability landed us in the\npool of sorrow as they equalise d. So\nthe ox of unity ploughed our field\nof dreams (final platypus: 2-2).\nB 'ball ly as, this time really)\nOn Wednesday (24th Feb), the IC\nwomen's basketball team played\ntheir first game after returning from\nMoscow (see Felix 959). The match\nwas an away match against the\nLondon School of Economics which\nis top of the league.\nThe IC team was playing with\nonly eight players (the other two,\nincluding the captain Pia Aanstad,\nwere ill) and two of the eight\nplayers had knee and back injuries\nrespectively. Despite all of the\nproblems, IC played an excellent\ngame keeping up with the\nchampions until the last three\nminutes of the game with one point\ndifference. LSE took advantage of\nour fatigued and injure rd players to\nwin with a ten point difference.\nNellie Zeniou (also the coach) and\nIldiko Cservenyak were the top\nscorers whereas Anette Fidrich did\na great job on defence.\nThe rematch will be next week in\nthe volleyball court (behind\nChemistry).\nThe quarter-final stages of the\nindoor soccer tournament took\nplace this week. The eight teams\nthat qualified for the quarter finals\nwere: Pakistan Soc, Lebanese Soc,\nSikh Soc, Anti-Apartheid Soc,\nIranian Soc, Cypriot Soc, Latin\nAmerican Soc and the Chinese Soc.\nHaving played some difficult first\nround games the teams were now\nfaced with the knock-out stage in\nwhich there was no room for\nmistakes. All the games proved to\nbe fast and thrilling, with the\nscore lines not truly reflecting the\ncloseness of the matches.\nThe Pakistan Soc team yet again\nwon! Their all round performance,\napplication and ability was to be\nadmired. The Cypriot Soc also won\ntheir quarter final match with their\ndirect and tough approach to\nfootball. The Sikh Soc qualified for\nthe semi-finals on Wednesday\nevening with a solid performance\nDribblers\nFollowing last week's humiliating\ndefeat (Dribs lost 14-0 to Kings),\nthe Dribblers were back on fine\nform this week against Royal\nHdlloway at Harlington. With\nleading goal-scorer Eleanor away\nand a team of only ten, things could\nhave been very difficult but an\nexcellent goal from Jo from the\nedge of the area early on in the\nsecond half put us 1-0 ahead and\ncaused their goalie to walk off in\ndisgust. Man of the match has to be\nthe Royal Holloway supporter who\nfound herself in goal for the rest of\nthe match. The Dribblers dominated\nthe remainder of the match, but\ndespite some fine chances created\nby Paula and Juliette we were\nunable to score again. Everybody\nplayed well, especially Caroline and\nChristine who managed to remain\nupright throughout the whole match\nfor the first time this season.\nSTUDENT ACCOMMODATION OFFICE\nWe have the following vacancies in\nHalls of Residence:\nHall Room Student\nType Required\nSouthwell Share Female UG\nOlave House Share Male PG\nFisher Share Female UG\nMontpelier Double Married couple (no\nMontpelier\nchildren)\nPrince's Gdns 2 bed flat Married couple\nBernard Sunley Share Male UG\nFor further details, please call into the\nAccommodation Office at 15 Prince's Gardens\nFINAL GROUP TABLES GROUP 3\nagainst the Chinese Soc.

One a snowy, wintry\nmorning IC's spirits were, to say\nthe least, low, due to toe and ankle\ninjuries both T Botzios and A Fenton respectively and with A Galloway not having had a minutes\nsleep the previous night due to a horrible toothache, and without R Dixon who had preferred to go\ntraining in the snow with his UL U mates.\nOn arrival at Keele for\nregistration we looked completely\nout of place compared to the other\nteams with their ten man squads.\nWith no substitutes and no training\nball we looked like we were\ndestined to go out in the first round.\nBut in our first game against Bath\nwe were to prove everyone wrong\nas we obtained a11 draw after\nhaving missed numerous chances\nincluding a penalty by B Willis. The\nnext game against UC NW was a crucial one that had to be won to get\nthrough to the second round, and\nwe easily surpassed the Welsh\nobstacle with a convincing 3-1 win.\nTwo goals coming from Tellis and\none from Annan who was also\nseverely cautioned by the referee\nfor his 'Vinny Jones' style play.\nThe 2nd round brought us up\nagainst tournament favourites\nLiverpool who had two U AU nationals in their side. An early goal\nfrom free kick specialist T Botzios\ngave us the lead which, to\neveryone's surprise, we held on to\ntill the end with some great\ndefending from BT Willis and some\nincredible saves from keeper M Atherton, which brought shouts of\namazement from the crowd.\nFor the first time ever an IC side\nhad proceeded to the quarter-finals\nof this particular tournament where\nwe were to play Southampton who\nhad lost to Liverpool in the 1st round. Again we took the lead from\na great curling shot from the\nhar l way line from A Fenton but did\nnot manage to retain the lead and\nthe game ended 1-1. Southampton\nbrought on their two substitutes in\nextra time and their fitness was the\ncrucial factor. Both sides had\nchances to score but Southampton\nclinched the winner two mint u es from time but we had no energy left\nto equalise and the game was lost\n2-1.\nMany thanks must go to our\nmascot, Bernard the Bear, whose\nphysical presence on the sidelines\ninspired us to our great\nperformances.\nRESULTS RUGBY\nIC RFU 1st \u201421\nWest London Institute\u20141J IC RFU 2nd10 Goldsmiths-9\nmmm mum m \u2022 '^kJ F Felix is produced for and on behalf of the Imperial College Union Publications Board and is printed by the Imperial College\nMm mm I/j Union Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB( Tel: 071-225 8672).

Eager to have a high turnout this year (let's see if with can\nall go wild and top the heady\nheights of 20%) the charismatic\nDougie L 'Amour leads all you\nvirgin voters (and indeed those not\nso virgin voters who could do with\na reminder - please, no names, no\npack drill: We 're not here to score\npoints, just votes) through the\npotentially intellectual minefield\nthat is the Single Transferable Vote\n(STV) System.\nSTV, as the more enlightened\nwill know, has nothing to do with\nproblematic fungi and painful trips\nto the toilet, but is in fact the voting\nsystem that John Cleese (and the\nother Liberal Democrat) would\nstick fly paper to their genitals for,\nYOU, dear voter, don't have to.\nbecause we've go it right here at\nImperial College (STV that is and\nnot the fly paper).\nTo be a winner under STV a can didi ate needs more that 50% of\nthe vote. If no lucky candidate\nreaches the finishing line on the first\nrun out then the least popular\ncandidate (that's the one with the\nfewest votes) is eliminated and their\nvotes are distributed amongst the\nother candidates according to the\nsecond preferences expressed on\nthose papers. So if 8 out of 10\nvoters (who expressed a preference)\nwent for candidate A instead of\ncandidate B then candidate A would\nget 8 more votes and candidate B the other 2. The sharing out of votes\ncarries on like this until one tired\nand emotional candidate crosses the\nmagical 50% line and is declared\nthe winner.\nJust to spice up the race there is\nalso included that unknown\nquantity, NEW ELECTION. If this\nmystery person wins the election\nthen a whole new election is called\n(no surprises there).\nGetting the most out of your vote\nis as easy as 1,2,3 (or 1,2,3,4,5,6\nif 6 candidates are standing).Even\nif your favourite candidate doesn't reach 50% then by putting 2 next\nto your next favourite etc you can\nhelp elect another candidate. But\nremember, by putting 1 next to your\nchoice and 2 next to somebody else\nyou are not affecting the chances of\nyour favourite winning.\nREMEMBER,S TV USES\nNUMBERS NOT TICKS AND CROSSES. If you mark a paper\nwith a tick or cross (or do zy fat\nto s ser etc) then it becomes invalid.\nYour vote will have been a waste\nof time and you won't have helped\nyour candidate. Start with a1( for\nyour favourite) and work your way\ndown, using only each number\nonce.\nIf your still confused about STV\nthen here is an example election to\nhelp\nYou are given a ballot paper for\nPresident. Tweedle Dum, Tweedle\nDee, Lemming and New Election\nare standing. You decide to vote as\nfollows\nTweedle Dum 4\nTweedle Dee 3\nLemming 1\nNew Election 2\nWhen all the votes are counted up\n(on the first preferences) they\npoll\nTweedle Dum\nTweedle Dee\nLemming\nNew Election\n230\n270\n410\n290\n1200\nBut lu m my! No one has reached the\n50% quota figure of 601,so silly old\nTweedle Dum is eliminated and\nhis/her second preferences are\nshared out. Of Tweedle's230 votes\n175 are given to Lemming, 25 to\nNew Election, 15 to Tweedle Dee\nwith 15 having no second\npreference. So the candidates\nremaining now have the following\nvotes\nTweedle Dee\nLemming\nNew Election\nNon Transferable\n285\n585\n315\n15\n1200\nCan we guess what happens now?\nYes, that's right, unlucky Tweedle\nDee is shown the door by the voters\nand told to get a job (or indeed bathe\nin the shallow waters of more\nHigher Education). So the quota\nnow becomes 593 due to non\ntransferable votes (half of 1185 plus\n1). Tweedle Dee's are again shared\nout according to the next preference\n(those with 1st preference for\nTweedle Dee are shared out to\nhis/her second preferences, voters\nwho gave Tweedle Dee a number\ntwo (no sniggering) are shared out\nto the third preferences. If any of\nthese preferences are Tweedle\nDum, then they are shared out to\ntheir next preference. So of\nTweedle Dee's285 votes 200 go to\nLemming, 35 to New Election and\n50 are non transferable (because\nthey had no further preferences).\nAfter a quick add up the votes\nallocated are now\nLemming\nNew Election\nNon Transferable\n785\n350\n65\n1200\nHoorah, hoorah, we have a winner.\nLemming pops in the winner, in the\n88th minute (must be a Gunner),\nover the line by a short head, it was\nin ref honest.\nI guess there's a fair chance that\nmost of you gave up on trying to get\nyour head round STV (please no\ntitters) as it is quite a complex\nsystem. But it is, as you now\nunderstand^), ridiculously fair and\ndemocratic, which is probably why\nthe Lib Dems like it so much (where\nare they now?). If you do though\nwish to know more (not likely) then\ngo see I>> mini c Wilkinson the Hon.\nSec., who has the super job of being\nthe Returning Officer (the posh\nname for the sad individual who\ncounts the votes).

One of the highlights\nof the series is the chance to hear\nRostropovich as the soloist in the\ndarkly magnificent Cello\nSymphony, which Britten dedicated\nto him, but he is appearing mainly\nas a conductor, and it was in this\nrole that he began the Festival with\na programme, which once one had\naccepted the fact that it didn't contain any original Britten, was\nboth logical and daring.\nColin Matthews was musical\nassistant to Britten during the\nlatter's final years, and the\ngamelan-like writing for gongs and\nbells in his new piece Memorial is\na reminder that Balinese music also\ninspired Britten, although the work\nis not a conscious tribute.

A setting for\nsoprano, brass, strings and\npercussion of poems by various\nauthors, the unifying theme of the\ntexts is death, and the tone is\npredominantly one of tragedy and\ndespair. Rostropovich drew playing\nof passionate corr rmit ment from the\nLSO strings, making the most of the\nmusic's emotional extremes, such\nas the numb, keening violin line of\nthe first Lorca setting, and the\ngrotesque gypsy fiddling of the\nsecond. Soprano Elena Prokina\ncaptures the radian ace at the end of\n'Loreley', the regret and bitterness\nof 'The Suicide', and the anguish\nof 'On the Alert'. The powerful\ndark-voiced bass Mikhail Krutikov\nwas equally penetrating; even in\n'Delvig', the work's one glimmer\nof hope, any sense of comfort\nseemed coloured by the\nremembrance of previous suffering.\nThere is no consolation at the end\nof this symphony, nor was there any\nin the original Japanese Noh play\non which Britten based his church\n\u2022\nMarriage of Figaro.\nopera Curlew River, the story of\na woman, mad with grief, searching\nfor her abducted son. The opera's final scene, added by librettist\nWilliam Plomer, in which the boy's spirit appears in order to reassure\nhis mother, formed a truly moving\nclimax to the superbly played and\nsung production given by the\nGuildhall School of Music and\nDrama. Outstanding were Gwyn\nHughes Jones as the Ferryman,\nMark Milhofer as the Madwoman,\nand the horn playing of Nicholas\nKorth.\nShostakovich featured again on\nSunday afternoon, when the\nBorodin String Quartet played\nsome of his earlier works along with\nBritten's first two quartets. The\nhighlight of the programme was the\nmature Second String Quartet, and\nin particular a memorable account\nof the eerie scherzo.\nThat evening, the first all-Britten\nprogramme of the Festival found\nthe LSO and Rostropovich at the\npeak of their form. Well-pointed\nrhythms and dynamic contrast\ncharacterised the Simple\nSymphony, and if in the Piano\nConcerto Barry Douglas had to\nstruggle to give cohesion to a piano\npart which veers from Prokofiev to\nRachmaninov via Falla's Gardens\nof Spain, the orchestra relished\nBritten's eclectic writing, with\nbeautiful clarinet playing in the\nMahlerian 'Waltz' and rich lower\nstrings in the big-tune 'Impromptu'.\nAfter a glorious account of Les\nIlluminations from soprano Lynda\nRussell, the slightly ponder us start\nof the 'Lachrymosa' threatened to\nmake an anticlimax of the Sinfonia\nda Requiem, but doubts were\ndispelled by the snarling, mocking\nbrass of the 'Dies i rae' and the\nradiance of the final 'Requiem\naeternam'.\nAs an encore, the orchestra tore\ninto the 'Storm' interlude from\nPeter Grimes, the opera which\ncatapulted Britten to international\nfame in 1945.

Money from RAG Week, merchandise and events such\nas The Rocky Horror Disco will be\nsplit up between the following\ncharities:\nTurning Point, Shelter, FAR A, Action Research for Multiple\nSclerosis and local charities.\nTurning Point is the largest\nnational charity helping people with\ndrink, drug and mental health\nproblems. Founded in 1964 and\noperating over 40 projects\nthroughout the country, Turning\nPoint provides residential\nrehabilitation, day care and street-level advice and support. In the last\nyear alone it has helped over 12,000\npeople, two-thirds of whom were\ncontacting the charity for the first\ntime.\nShelter has, for over 20 years,\nbeen waging a war against bad\nhousing and homelessness. Last\nyear Shelter helped over 30,000\npeople, supporting many projects\naimed at mutual support and better\nhousing. Close to home a west\nLondon scheme offers practical\nsupport to homeless people in the\ncapital's overcrowded B&B hotels.\nFAR A( Faure-Alderson\nRomanian Appeal) was established\nonly in December 1990, and has\ntaken responsibility for two\ninstitutions in NE Romania, an\norphanage and an asylum. Work at\nthe orphanage is to encourage the\nchildren and develop their self\nconfidence. Food, clothes,\nmedicine, vitamins and educational\nequipment has been provided. The\nasylum houses 250 adults classed as\nmentally ill but in fact most have\nphysical not mental disabilities.\nFAR A has provided running water\nat the home, doctors, clothes,\nmattresses and blankets etc. A number of students from IC and\nMarys have helped FARA, and\nsome have actually been to the\norphanage to give the children a happy Christmas.\nARMS works in a battle against\nMultiple Sclerosis, a degenerative\ndisease of the central nervous\nsystem. It leads to both physical and\nemotional problems. ARMS helps\nresearch but emphasises its work on\ntreating the disease to provide the\nbest possible quality of life.\nLocal charities are also\nsupported, improving our link with\nthe community.
