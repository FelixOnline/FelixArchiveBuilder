In other\nnews, research suggests\nthat narcissists are more\nlikely to be successful\nthan people with healthy\nattitudes to self.\nKanye West\u2019s latest\nrelease JESUS IS KING\nfollows his 2017 pattern\nof releasing trimmed\ndown records, with a\nrun time short of half an\nhour with every track\nunder 4 minutes. The\nmost obvious thing that\ndistinguishes it from Ye is\nits attitude to life, while Ye\nexplores the jagged edges\nof West\u2019s bipolar disorder,\nas well as West\u2019s complex\nrelationship with women,\nJESUS IS KING finds\nKanye returning to the\nreligious roots that shone\nthrough on gems like\n\u201cJesus Walks\u201d more than\n10 years ago.\nJESUS IS KING\u2019s\ngospel influences are\napparent in the album\u2019s\npalette. The opening\ntrack is amongst many\nothers to revolve around\nlayered, soulful vocals,\nalthough autotune and\na touch of compression\ngive them a distinctively\nmodern sound, reminiscent of Bon Iver\u2019s recent\noutings, or perhaps more\nobviously any number\nof modern-day croon\nrappers. Numerous gospel\nsamples (including a\nreuse of father stretch my\nhands) provide the basis\nfor tracks. None of these\nhowever, are innovative\nor interesting.\nOn JESUS IS KING\u2019s\nstrongest tracks we find\nKanye\u2019s following of\nKids See Ghosts and the\nLife of Pablo, packing\nthick sub-bass and explosive percussion into the\nclimax of \u201cSelah\u201d. The\nLP brims with eclectic\ninstrumental choices,\nfrom the aforementioned\ngospel vocals, which find\ndifferent contexts on each\ntrack; from Psychedelic\non \u201cWater\u201d, to epic on\n\u201cSelah\u201d, and of course\npassionate and soulful on\n\u201cEver Hour\u201d and \u201cGod\nis\u201d; moody classical\nguitar on \u201cClosed on\nSunday\u201d; and glossy,\nbubble-gum synths on\nPi\u2019erre Bourne-produced\n\u201cOn God\u201d.\nFeatures from Clipse\n(Pusha T and his brother)\nstand out for their blunt,\nwell-crafted rhymes,\nKenny G\u2019s appearance on\nthe same track fits surprisingly well. Unfortunately,\nWest\u2019s songwriting kills\nthe listenability of tracks;\nit is evident the Keeping\nup with the Kardashians\nstar has little to say, his\nreligious message incoherent and inconsistent,\nand his verses filled with\ninane bars on not \u201cletting\nhis family starve\u201d and\npeople judging him, which\ncome across as blander\nand more unrelatable than\never. Upon further rumi-nation, not a word or tune\nfrom Kanye\u2019s mouth adds\nvalue to the record.\nWest also treats listeners to his un-autotuned\nvoice, an abhorrent timbre\nthat manages to be thin\nand painful on the ear at\nthe same time. The grating\nof West\u2019s vocal chords is\nworsened when they carry\nthe weak melodic lines\nof tracks like \u201cClosed on\nSunday\u201d and \u201cOn God\u201d;\nplease don\u2019t subject\nyourself to them.\nUltimately, while\nJESUS IS KING brings\na few interesting tracks\nto the table, most don\u2019t\nwarrant a second thought.\nA first listen is generous,\nand no listening is best.\n\u201cThe whole\nthing just\nslaps. Trust\nme\u201d- Kanye\nWest\n\u201cUltimately,\nnot a word\nor tune from\nKanye\u2019s mouth\nadds value to\nthe record\u201d\nEven the cover is uninspired // Pitchfork\nMUSIC\nMiles Gulliford\nMusic Editor\nArtist: Kanye West.

Brexit has been\nthe key political issue\nof the last three years, a\nproblem that successive\ngovernments have been\nunable to satisfactorily\nresolve.\nThe calling of this\nelection is directly linked\nto the Brexit process and\nwill have a significant\nimpact on the outcome.\nBoris Johnson\u2019s government was formed as\na result of the leadership\nelection following the\nresignation of Theresa\nMay. Theresa May\u2019s government was only possible\nas a result of a confidence\nand supply deal (a promise\nto vote with the Tories)\nwith the Democratic\nUnionist Party, a unionist\nparty of Northern Ireland,\nproviding only a very slim\nmajority in Parliament.\nFollowing Boris Johnson\u2019s controversial stance\nthat a No-Deal Brexit must\nbe an option for the UKEU negotiations, Johnson\nattempted to trigger an\nearly election twice but\nfailed to win the vote both\ntimes. In the past, a British\nPrime Minister was able\nto dissolve Parliament at\nwill, effectively calling\na General Election.\nHowever, the Fixed Term\nParliament Act of 2010\nchanged this. Negotiated\nas a condition of the 2010\nTory-Liberal Democrat\ncoalition, this act was\nintended to prevent\neither side from being\nable to bring down the\ngovernment by imposing\na requirement for a two-thirds vote in the House of\nCommons in order to call\na General Election.\nDespite this, in the\nongoing negotiations with\nthe EU Johnson continued\nto press for the No-Deal\noption but was defeated\nin a series of key votes,\npreventing the No-Deal\nscenario. These votes\nwere partially lost as a\nresult of 21 Conservative\nMPs rebelling against\nJohnson\u2019s government\nand subsequently being\nkicked out of the party.\nSome of those MPs have\nnow been readmitted.\nA Brexit deal between\nthe EU and the UK has\nnow been agreed, which\nallays the concerns of\nmany with regards to a\nNo-Deal Brexit. That\nthreat having subsided,\nthe parties that were\npreviously opposed to\nthe prospect of a new\nelection have approved a\nUK general election for\nthe 12th of December.\nHowever, the approved\n\u2018deal\u2019 is only a political\ndeclaration of what a\nfuture trading relationship\nwould look like, rather\nthan an actual binding\ncontract which will take\nmany more months to\nhash out.\nEach of the political\nparties, Conservatives,\nLabour, Liberal Democrats, Greens, Brexit Party\nand others are lining up\nfor an election that will\ndetermine who will lead\nthe country over the next\nfive years and impose new\nfiscal and social policies\non the UK. Furthermore,\nBrexit will remain a key\nissue with the potential for\nrenegotiation, or a second\nreferendum dependending\non the outcome of the\nelection.\nThe result of this\nupcoming election will,\nA general election has been called for December 12th, eligible voters should ensure they are registed to vote\nThe Conservatives\nare hoping for a strong\nelection victory that\nremoves their dependence\non the DUP and provides\nthem with a sufficient\nmajority to enact their\neconomically liberal\nfiscal policies as well as\nachieving their hard-line\nstance on the EU-UK\ndeal. Reduced regulation\nand taxes, as well as\npotentially reopening\nthe negotiations with\nthe EU with the strong\npossibility of a No Deal.\nThis election may also be\ncrucial for the direction of\nthe Conservative party as\na whole, with a significant\nvictory moving it to the\nright, while a loss could\nlead to a revolt by the\nmore moderate MPs.\nConservative Labour\nLabour are also aiming\nfor a strong election\nvictory, that would allow\nthem to enact their socialist fiscal policies. After\nnine years in opposition\nand a leadership change,\nthe Labour party is almost\nunrecognisable from the\nlast time it was in power.\nThey will renationalise\nsignificant parts of the\nUK economy as well as\nincreasing taxes for some\nsections of society, Labour\nare also aiming to allow\na second referendum on\nBrexit. The Labour party\nis also vulnerable to a\nchange in direction, with\na loss possibly resulting in\nthe removal of the divisive\nfigure of Jeremy Corbyn.\nThe Liberal Democrats are hoping to win\n\u201cHundreds of seats,\u201d by\ndecisively capturing the\nremain vote. This remains\na key element of their\npolicy, with the goal of\ncancelling Brexit entirely\nthrough a second referen-dum.\nLiberal Democrats\nGreen\nThe Greens are aiming\nto capitalise on the Green\nWave sweeping the world.\nIncreased awareness\nof the environmental\nmovement may help the\nGreens to gain a couple\nmore votes and enact\ntheir programme of environmentally and socially\nconscious reforms.\nBrexit\nThe Brexit party are\naiming for exactly that-Brexit at all costs. They\ncould be said to match or\nexceed the Conservative\nparty\u2019s aims when it\ncomes to socially and economically conservative\nreforms.\nSNP\nThe SNP are aiming\nfor a strong election result\nNorth of the border in\norder to provide impetus\nfor a second Independence\nReferendum. This is likely\nto hinge on the likelihood\nof a No-Deal Brexit and\nthe probability of an\nunpopular Conservative\ngovernment in London.\nOther smaller parties\nwill of course also be\nfighting for seats across\nthe country.

There's nothing not\nto love about it.\nSee, it feels very different from other holidays.\nYes, it suffers from the\nsame gradual suffusion of\ncorporate nonsense - yes,\nHalloween decorations\ngo up earlier every single\nyear in a morally bankrupt\nattempt to capitalise on\nhappiness and excitement.\nGod Bless Neoliberalism.\nHowever, it doesn't\nquite suffer the same\ncheesiness as other hol-idays. Or rather, plenty\nof cheese abounds, but it\nhasn't quite seeped into the\npublic perception of the\nholiday yet. I still associate Halloween with some\nof its traditional values,\nwith a time for ghosts\nand ghouls, rather than\nthe ruin that is my cynical\nadult view of holidays\nlike Christmas - which are\nonly good because I get a\nday off and can drink with\nmy lovely family at 9am\nwithout feeling quite as\nguilty.\nHalloween still feels\nspooky, the way it's meant\nto be. They haven't robbed\nus of that yet, no matter\nhow much of a superficial\nveneer of marketing goodness they smear over the\ntop. I still look over my\nshoulder on Halloween,\nlate at night on the streets\nwith my breath puffing\ninto mist before me. I still\nsleep a little bit less easy\nthat night - and I relish it.\nWeirdly, I developed\nthis love without ever\ntrick-or-treating much as\na kid. I dressed up sometimes - my mum is just the\nmost fantastic face-paint-er, although unfortunately\nI inherited little of her artistic talent. But only once\nor twice did I partake in\nthe tradition that for many\npeople defines the identity\nof Halloween from their\nchildhood. The one time\nI tried in the small village\nI grew up in, I ended up\nknocking at the door of a\nman who had had recently\nhad a stroke - who came,\nand answered kindly in a\nrusty voice that he'd had\na stroke and didn't have\nanything for me. I didn't\nunderstand at the time,\nbut my mum's reaction\nand apology made it\nclear - I felt chagrined to\nhave bothered someone\ngoing through a hard\ntime. Maybe that spoiled\nit a bit for me - my first\nexperience being the\nknowledge that whenever\nyou have fun, someone\nelse is suffering horribly\nsomewhere.\nNo, Halloween became\nspecial to me after I\nmoved to Edinburgh. My\nexperiences in Scotland\nare a topic for another\nEditorial, but this one I'm\ncracking out now - The\nSamhain Festival.\nMy family took me\none year - I must have\nbeen only around 12.\nWe walked up the hill\nto the Royal Mile, the\ncobbled ancient street\ndescending down from\nthe castle to Holyrood.\nIt's full of old Victorian\ntenements, cathedrals, the\nancient stone of the castle\nitself. It positively reeks\nof history, of Burke and\nHare, of the grisly plagues\nand dirty streets of times\npast - especially late at\nnight. Edinburgh's ghost\ntours almost always start\nfrom the Royal Mile, and\nMary King's Close - the\nfamous twisting alley\nwhere plague victims\nwere blocked off to die -lies just off to the side.\nOutside of St. Giles'\nCathedral, there's a square\n(on which, for reference,\nlies the Heart of Midlothian - a spot for public\nexecution in years past.)\nThere, people gathered.\nBack then, it was many,\nbut still a small boy like\nme could see. We waited,\nchatting in the cold, and\nthrough the fog they came.\nAutomations, almost - but\nno, they were stilt walkers,\nwearing costumes such as\nI had never seen - ones\nthat genuinely seemed\ncreepy, unnerving, rather\nthan the plastic I wore\nstrapped to my face. I was\nmesmerised. There was\nfire, there was everything.\nHonestly, I don't recall\nmuch detail - it was an\nexperience, and one that\nmade me realise the affinity for the appalling I\nfeel I sometimes have. I'm\ndrawn to the creepiness.\nMaybe that's why I was\nsuch an emo teenager.\nI left feeling very different about the night - no\nlonger caring for the idea\nof trick-or-treating, but\nrather determined to come\nback to that festival every\nyear. It held something\npure, something crystal-line, something dark and\nmorbid and attractive\nin that. It felt as ancient\nas those cobbled stones,\nalong which those stilt\nwalkers moved with such\ngrace. It imprinted a love\nin me that will last for the\nrest of my life.\nNow I live in London,\nand I haven't checked\nto see about equivalent\nevents here. I wasted my\nHalloweens in my degree\nyears getting drunk at\nmediocre parties. In my\nfirst year, I escorted an\nunknown IC student\nfrom Fabric to Waterloo\nbecause he was too drunk\nto stand, after having been\npickpocketed, and then\nhad to walk home to South\nKensington - having only\nbeen in London a month.\nAdmittedly, that was a bit\nof a treat, though perhaps\na little too real for comfort.\nThis year, I'm working on\nHalloween - indeed, I'm\nwriting this Editorial on\nthe night itself, letting that\nsensation steal over me\nand looking forward to\nthe deliciously unnerving\ntrain ride home. But also,\nthere's something just\nspecial about Edinburgh,\nabout Samhain. I don't\nwant to shatter that crystalline impression I have,\nthat defined my favourite\nholiday forevermore.\nFront Cover, Centrefold // Taja\nStrle\nI\n\n"

    "content": "The Loyle Carner Starter Pack: A \u201cHow To\u201d Guide\nA fan of Loyle Carner and his music? Ever wanted to be the man yourself? Then follow this easy six-step formula.\nMUSIC\nGuthrie Ruby\nMusic Editor\nI\nshould start by saying\nthat I do enjoy Loyle\nCarner\u2019s music. It\u2019s\njust that since the\nrelease of Not Waving,\nBut Drowning his musical formula has become\nannoyingly apparent. The\nguy has talent and lots\nof people get something\nfrom his music, but he\nain\u2019t immune to criticism.\nNow that I\u2019ve completely\nconvinced you I\u2019m not\na prick for writing this,\nlet me take you through\nthe six steps you need to\nbecome your own mini\nCarner.\nBefore step one you\u2019re\ngoing to need a stage\nname. Loyle Carner\u2019s real\nname is Ben Coyle-Larner. See what he did there?\nSo, my stage name would\nbe Ruthrie Guby. Alright\nnow let\u2019s hit the studio.\n1\n- Every rap song\nneeds a beat, so\nthat\u2019s where we\u2019ll\nstart. Carner\u2019s beats\nreflect his \u201cdown to earth\u201d\nstyle/brand by using\nacoustic instruments and\nsamples. A nice crisp\ndrum kit with a good high-hat and rim click sound is\nguaranteed to match more\nthan half of Carner\u2019s dis-cography. Maybe throw in\nan open high-hat or variation on the kick drum,\nbut don\u2019t make yourself\nwork too hard. On top\nof your drums you\u2019ll\nneed a catchy melody\n\u201c... all we have\nto do is garner\na following of\nmillions and\nproduce a\ncollection of\nsongs...\u201d\n\u201cMaybe throw\nin an open\nhigh-hat or\nvariation on\nthe kick drum,\nbut you don\u2019t\nwant to make\nyourself work\ntoo hard.\u201d\nthat can loop and not get\nannoying. If you\u2019re stuck\non which instrument to\nchoose then just pick the\nfirst piano you see. If you\ncan\u2019t play an instrument\ndon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re going\nto need a friend like Tom\nMisch eventually and I\u2019m\nsure they\u2019ll be able to riff\nsomething better than you\ncan.\n2\n- Now that you\u2019ve\ngot something to\nrap over it\u2019s time\nfor you to show off\nyour vocals. The contents\nof Carner\u2019s verses are\ndiverse enough to make\nthem difficult to group\ninto one category, but his\nchoruses are a different\nstory. Write something\neither two or four lines\nlong, the simpler the\nbetter. The most important\npart of this step is that you\nmust repeat what you\nwrote twice. It\u2019s important that people are able\nto sing along after just one\nlisten. Even if you have a\ntalented songwriter (e.g.\nJorja Smith) featuring on\nyour track you still need\nto wedge in there with\na doubled-up simplistic\nchorus.\n3\n- You\u2019ve got the\ncatchiest parts of\nthe song sorted,\nnow you need\nsome substance for the\nverses. Carner doesn\u2019t\nget worked up over a lot,\nso your approach should\nbe as thoughtful and\nconsidered as possible.\nPresent your chosen topic\nin words that seem like\nthey\u2019ve been inspired\nby a conversation with a\ntherapist \u2013 a healthy way\nof looking at it. The key\npart of matching Carner\u2019s\nstyle is recreating his\ntimbre. The best way I can\ndescribe it is \u201cbreakfast tea\nrap\u201d. Like a sleepier Rejjie\nSnow or Mick Jenkins but\nwithout talking about ass.\nReasonable tempo, no\nsign of aggression/anger,\nand low energy.\ngot a guardian we love and\ncherish, but you\u2019ll need to\nturn that love up to eleven.\nCarner loves his mum\nlike Kanye loves Kanye.\nJean (his mum) even has\nher own track on Not\nWaving, But Drowning; a\ntouching letter to her son.\nPlease don\u2019t think I have\na problem with this step,\nit\u2019s actually my favourite\npiece of his repetitive\nnature. His love for Jean\nis not a bad thing, it just\nis a thing.\n5\n- Human connection is at the heart\nof Carner\u2019s albums,\nand nothing\nscreams human connection more than a collection\nof secretly recorded voice\nmemos. In Not Waving,\nBut Drowning Carner had\nrecordings of chilling in\nthe studio, the World Cup,\ntalking to a cab driver,\netc. Once you\u2019ve got your\nmemos, pick four or five\nand wedge them in there\nat seemingly random\nmoments.\n6\n- Lastly, you\u2019ve got\nto get the \u201cuh\u201ds.\nThe \u201cuh\u201d is a staple\nof the Carner style.\nGot a moment in a track\nthat feels like it\u2019s missing\nsomething? Just exhale\nshortly and make a vague\nnoise. For some reason\nthis is the one that bugs\nme the most, probably\nthe reason I decided to\nwrite this. I\u2019ve combed\nthe lyrics, crunched the\nnumbers, and mathematically proven that from\ndebut to second album\nCarner has become more\nrepetitive. There was an\noverall increase in \u201cuhs\u201d\nof 134% from album 1 to\nalbum 2, with a track by\ntrack increase of 155%.\nIn album 2 there was an\naverage of one \u201cuh\u201d every\n26 seconds. I could pull\nup my working or make a\nchart, but you likely started reading this to escape\nusing your brain.\nPhew it\u2019s all done, and\nlook at us, just a couple\nof Carners. That was the\nhard part. With our toolkit\nformula perfected we\u2019ll\nsoon be topping Carner\nhimself. Now, all we have\nto do is garner a following\nof millions and produce a\ncollection of songs with\nmillions of streams.\nThe meme format inspiration // Amanda Hertzberg\nMUSIC\nFRIDAY, 1st\nNOVEMBER, 2019 FELIX\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMe listening through the album for a second time // Phil Sharp\n4\n- Hey presto!\nYou\u2019ve made a\nsong, but you\naren\u2019t fully living\nthe Carner lifestyle.

It is,\nas often has been, David\nversus Goliath.\nThe year was 1965,\nthe United Kingdom was\nabout to relinquish its\nsovereignty over Mauritius, an insular state in the\nIndian Ocean located not\ntoo far from Madagascar.\nProper independence for\nMauritians would follow\nthree years later, but in\nthat fatidic year Harold\nWilson\u2019s governments\nimplemented the separation between the island\nof Mauritius itself and\nan archipelago located\nhalfway between the\nmain island and India, the\nChagos Islands. France\nhad administered the\ndependency of the archipelago to Mauritius in the\nmid 18th Century when\nthey claimed the territory,\nand they have belonged to\ndocument from 1966 by\nForeign Office\u2019s senior\nadvisor Denis Greenhill\nrefers to the islanders as\n\u201csome few Tarzans and\nMen Fridays\u201d in a sad\nreference to Edgar Rice\nBurrough\u2019s and Daniel\nDefoe\u2019s masterpieces\nrespectively.\nAfter being constrained\nto leave their homes, the\nChagossians were at least\ngranted in 2002 the right\nto British Citizenship,\nallowing many of them\nand their descendants to\nmove to Britain, founding\na conspicuous community\nin Crawley, West Sussex.\nThere, some have recently\ndenounced the existence\nof a hostile environment\nin a period in which the\nWindrush scandal is still\nfirm in the memory of\nmost.\nIn 2017, the International Court of Justice was\ncalled to evaluate whether\nsplitting the archipelago\nfrom Mauritius was\nlawful and what the legal\nconsequences and obligations are that the United\nKingdom has to undertake\ndue to its continuous\ncontrol of the islands.\n\u201cThe sun\nwas finally\nsetting on the\nBritish Empire,\nalthough\npreserving as\nmuch influence\nas possible\nwas certainly\nin its interest\u201d\nAmerican aircrafts in Diego Garcia base (Chagos Islands) // Wikimedia\n\u201cThe Chagos\nArchipelago,\nscarecely\npopulated and\nlocated in a\nkey strategical\nposition,\nwould\ncertainly fit\nthis purpose\u201d\n\u201cThe American\nbase plays a\nsignificant role\nin the fight for\nsupremacy in\nAsia between\nthe US and\nChina\u201d\nthe same colonial entity\never since. During the\nNapoleonic Wats, the UK\ncaptured Mauritius from\nFrance, thus also gaining\nsovereignty over the ar-chipelago. But the winds\nhad begun to change for\nthe UK after the Second\nWorld War and the sun\nwas finally setting on the\nBritish Empire, although\npreserving as much\ninfluence as possible was\ncertainly in its interest.\nThe Chagos Archipelago,\nscarcely populated and\nlocated in a key strategical position, would\ncertainly fit this purpose.\nThus, in 1968 the British\nGovernment began to\nforcibly relocate the two\nthousand inhabitants to\nMauritius, to create space\nfor the establishment of an\nAmerican military base on\nthe newly created British\nIndian Ocean Territory. A\nAsmallarchipelagointheIndianOcean,theatreofdecadeslonginjustice,couldprovefundamentalforthepower\nbalance in the region\nTo that matter, the Court\nanswered in February that\nthe UK is under obligation\nto end its administration\nof the islands as soon\nas possible, deeming it\nunlawful. In an ensuing\nvote at the UN General\nAssembly about the\nissue, the UK and the US\nexperienced a crushing\ndefeat 116-6, with many\ntraditional allies either\nabstaining or voting in\nfavour of the complete\ndecolonisation of the area.\nEven Pope Francis asked\nfor its return to Mauritius,\nwhose Prime Minister,\nPravind Jugnauth, defined\nthe Chagossians\u2019 removal\nas \u201cakin to a crime against\nhumanity\u201d. Meanwhile, in\nSeptember, it was revealed\nthat a secretive visit had\ntaken place to the islands,\nthe first formal one by\nMPs, two Conservatives\nand one Labour member.\nThis was regarded by\nsome as an expression\nof Britain\u2019s intention to\nin Asia between the US\nand China. One possible\nscenario if Britain hands\nback the islands to Mauritius, is that they could be\nleased by Mauritian au-thorithiestoChinainstead,\ninverting the power\nbalance in the Indian\nOcean. The bitter irony\nwould be that by repairing\na damage to the principles\nof self-determination\nand basic civil rights,\nthese western powers\ncould actually be doing a\nfavour to a country which\nsystematically disrespects\nthem on much larger\nscale. Therefore, whilst\nthe confrontation in the\nOrient grows in intensity,\nso does the grief of those\ndeprived of their ancestral\nsoil, and this is why it is\nnot the last we will hear of\nthe name Chagos.\nreassert its claim over the\nterritory.\nThe UK will certainly\nnot surrender the Chagos\nIslands because of a\nmere non-binding UN\nresolution, bringing to\nmind an issue other than\npost-colonialism that\nshould be considered: the\nIslands\u2019 strategical impor-tance. The American base\ncurrently, and possibly\neven more so in the future,\nplays a significant role in\nthe fight for supremacy\nISSUE 1732\nFELIX\n\n"

Located in the\nlate John Soane\u2019s house,\nthe museum is a rabbit\nwarren of impressively\ndecorated rooms and\nsecret cupboards; mirrors,\nartwork and sculpture line\nevery wall and surface.\nLook out for the compass\ndirections on the walls,\nthey might help you find\nyour way out again! I\nwould recommend visiting just to see the house,\nbut that\u2019s not why I was\nthere. The museum has\ntemporarily expanded\nits already significant\nWilliam Hogarth collection with pieces on loan\nfrom the National Gallery\nand private collections to\ncreate a complete collection of Hogarth\u2019s series.\nFor those not familiar\nwith Hogarth\u2019s work, he\nis said to be the father of\ncomics. A strongly busi-ness-minded man, he used\nthe power of the printing\npress (and the introduction of copyright laws\non images) to sell a vast\nnumber of images from\nhis \u2018series\u2019. These were\npaintings (usually two or\nmore and reproduced as\netching prints) that follow\nthe downward spiral of a\ncharacter\u2019s life typically\nending in syphilis or\ndeath. Intrigued by the\nimmorality of humans,\nHogarth\u2019s works, whilst\nimpressive and fascinat-ing, are rarely cheery. His\none major attempt at a\npositive series \u2018A happy\nmarriage\u2019 lies unfinished,\npossibly out of boredom.\nVisiting the works\nas part of the Soane\u2019s\nmuseums late\u2019s is a vastly\ndifferent experience to exploring them on your own\non a Saturday afternoon.\nThe tour begins with the\nsophistication of a gin\nand tonic accompanied by\na short introductory talk\nfrom our passionate and\nclearly knowledgeable\nguide. A prior knowledge\nof the artist is not required\nas she lead us through\nthe stories of Hogarth as\na man and the inspiration\nbehind the creation of his\nseries; by the time I left\nthe room to start viewing\nthe artworks, I felt I might\nbe as much in love with\nHogarth as she is.\nGuiding you through\nthe house, the tour stops\nat each of the series on\ndisplay with the guide\nexplaining the story and\npointing out interesting,\nand frequently humorous\naspects of the paintings\nand prints I wouldn\u2019t have\nspotted otherwise. For\nexample Hogarth\u2019s obsession with immorality\nand chaos is ever present\nin each work in the\nbackdrop, such as in the\ndestruction of buildings\nor furniture, or even just\nthe presence of something\nupturned.\nThe culture in which\nthe series were painted is\nintegral to their message,\nso I was grateful to\nreceive contextual\ncommentary from our\nguide and not be solely\ndependent on reading the\nplacards. I particularly\nenjoyed learning that he\nfelt \u2018The Four stages of\ncruelty\u2019 was so important\nhe needed to make it more\naccessible by producing a\ncheaper wooden print to\nsell to medical students.\nHis relation with his\naudience seemed sincere\nand involved, \u2018Marriage\na-la-mode\u2019was a response\nto criticism that his paintwork observations spared\nthe rich.\nUnfortunately, the flow\nof the tour was impeded by\nthe logistical errors on the\nmuseum\u2019s part. Moving\naround the house in a\ngroup of 15-20 it was impossible for us all to look\nat one artwork at the same\ntime so often you couldn\u2019t\nsee what the guide was so\nwonderfully explaining.\nIn addition, we were endlessly rushed from each\nroom to make way for the\nfollowing group meaning\nwe often didn\u2019t have time\nto properly appreciate the\nworks. But despite all this\nHogarth won out and I\nknow I\u2019ll be going back to\nappreciate his creativity at\nmy own leisure.\nHogarth: Place and\nProgress exhibition runs\ntill 05th Jan 2020 with\nfree entry but pre-booking\nrequired.

Harris explores the\npressures and tribulations\nof grief through the characters of Robyn (Marianne\nOldham) and Helen\n(Jessica Hardwick) who\nwash up on an unknown\nshore following a violent\nboating accident. In only\nan hour of performance,\nwe share in the shock,\nfear and love of these two\nwomen. However, the\nperformance definitely\nplays out in a crescendo,\nbuilding not only in\ndrama, but also quality.\nI found that the first\nportion of the script-particularly in the case\nof Robyn- was clutching\nat profoundness. This\ndialogue appeared forced\nand out of place. It is clear\nto Orpheus and Eurydice\nbecomes clear.\nRealising the true\nextent of their misfortune,\nRobyn and Helen turn on\neach other. The confrontation is driven by a fear\nof death, projected anger\nand lost time. Oldham\nand Hardwick deliver a\nconvincing and emotive\nperformance; the sheer\nfury of the women horri-fies. During the exchange,\nall ambient noise has\nceased, only adding to\nthe intensity of the scene.\nThankfully, the well-placed organic humour\nremains throughout, and\nthis is a true testament to\nthe bond between the two\nlovers.\nRobyn and Helen are\ntypical, mundane and\nwonderful characters; the\nactresses themselves are\ntruly stunning in their\nroles. Helen is excitable,\ninsatiable and full of life.\nHardwick endears her to\nus as an audience with her\npositivity and pure talent.\nRobyn is far more serious\nand anxious, the sensible\none of the pair but Oldham\nconveys her adoration of\nHelen so sincerely.\nThe jewel of the play\ncomes when Robyn asks\nfor too much, losing\nher soulmate as a result.\nOldham expresses her\nsorrow and agony with\na haunting display of\nemotion. She is nothing\nshort of exceptional and\nmany in the audience-including myself- were\nmoved almost to tears.\nFollowing Robyn\u2019s break-down, Helen returns to her\nfor a final few moments\ntogether. The soft flame\nshe brings between them\nprovides contrast to the\nstress just before. The\ncouple are calm and ac-cepting, content together.\nThis touching ending\nleaves the audience with\na real appreciation of life\nand love.\nMeet Me At Dawn is\na testament to human\nemotion and a showcase\nof raw talent.

You\ncould pick up lunch in\nQueenies, a College res-taurant, for 1/3 pennies,\nwhich equates to 11p in\ntoday\u2019s money.\nOn graduating, after\na year in Hertfordshire\nwith English Electric, my\nfriend Dave went off - as\ndid most of my contemporaries - to California,\nwhere he eventually\nfounded Altos Computers\nand at one time employed\n1600 people in a factory\nthat seemed me, when I\nvisited him, to be more\nakin to a five-star hotel.\nI instead stayed in East\nLondon and took over the\nfamily mechanical engineering firm on the death\nof my father in December\n1959, at the age of 21. We\nwere both lucky to have\nbeen presented with a\ngreat opportunity at a time\nwhen we were both able to\nmake the best of it: Dave\nmade on-board computers\nfor the American navy\nand I made coin-slide\nmechanisms when the UK\ndecimalised its currency.\nIn 2004 I met by chance\nLynda White who was the\nsenior mathematics tutor\nat the College. She mentioned that she wanted a\nfew prizes to be sponsored\nto encourage the students\nand I was very pleased to\nbe in a position to help.\nThey\u2019re called the Allen\nprizes and are still offered\nnow.\nBut these prizes would\nhave been called the\nAllen-Jackson prizes. My\nfriend Dave was sadly\nkilled in a mountain\ncycling accident in 2001.\nThe group of his close\nstudent friends sent him\noff with a poem: \u201cA\nYorkshire Lad\u201d, which\nI\u2019m sharing with students\ntoday.\nKen, Dave, and their friends from their many years in the Imperial community // Ken Allen\nISSUE 1732\nFELIX\nTHROWBACK books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n23\nA Yorkshire Lad\nHe came down from Yorkshire\nWhen our lives were young,\nHe rang the bells and drank the beer\nAnd kissed some fresh and eager lips\nHe came down from Yorkshire\nWhen that old Queen\u2019s world endured\nTo rush through dark, dank musty halls\nAnd there to eat and talk for one and three.\nHe came down from Yorkshire\nTo hear the blessed wisdom of the West,\nAnd sat enthralled and sometimes slept,\nTo comprehend some more the measured beauty of the world.\nHe came down from Yorkshire\nTo the sun-drenched land of promise\nHe built the boards and sold the dream,\nAnd freed himself to live again\nHe went back to Yorkshire\nTo breathe once more that childhood air\nHe sailed beneath the black star sky\nAnd knitted up the frayed ends of his life.\n\n"

Our reps are\none of the most important\nstudents are heard. You\nhopefully already know\nwho your reps are, but if\nyou don\u2019t, next week will\nbe your chance to meet\nthem!\nTalking to your reps\nthroughout the year is\nimportant and giving\nthem feedback doesn\u2019t\nhave to be limited to\nsurveys. A brief chat to\nyour rep about what you\nthink could be improved\ncan go a long way. Based\non student comments,\nstudent reps can ask lecturers to adapt their lecturing style (is the writing on\nthe board too small? Does\nthe lecturer use too many\nPowerPoints? Is the pace\ntoo fast? Tell your rep!) or\nlobby the department to\nmake significant changes\nto labs, lecture courses,\nor the way tutorials are\nrun.

This concept of\nphysical spaces is dying\nout quite quickly.\nAnd furthermore, I can\nsee it damaging the\npersonal networks of\nsupport students build\nup in departments with\npersonal tutors and so on,\nif there\u2019s another \u2018onestop shop\u2019 that\u2019s a bit\nmore faceless and general\nin its presentation.\nTalking of the multi-cam-pus approach \u2013 as DPW,\nhow do you think that\nmight affect students and\nthe Imperial community\nin years to come?\nI think that the communities that provide people\nthe greatest sense of belonging tend to be smaller\nlocal communities. So\nmy initial thought is that\nit potentially has benefits\n\u2013 you\u2019re one student in\n1000, rather than 10000.\nIt could help with that\nisolation and loneliness\nthat a lot of students at\nImperial feel. By far the\ncommunities that students\ntell me they feel most\nconnected to are their\nyears, and also their clubs\nand societies.\nThat\u2019s where they may\nbe some issue \u2013 societies\neither stay centralised\nat South Kensington\nand some students are\ndistanced from that, or\nthey fracture into cam-pus-based ones and we\nlose that collective. And,\nas another issue, things\nlike the Union building\nare currently firmly set in\nSouth Kensington \u2013 that\u2019s\nnot going anywhere.\nPerhaps another Union\nhub could be built at\nanother campus, but right\nnow it\u2019s so hypothetical\nand long-term that it\u2019s\nhard to pin down; I just\ndon\u2019t think it\u2019ll necessarily be better or worse, just\ndifferent, and the most\nimportant thing is that\nstudents have a place to\nfeel they belong.\nFelix: Speaking of\nmajor projects \u2013 let\u2019s\nget back on track.\nYou\u2019ve been working on rep training\nrecently?\nYes \u2013 especially over\nthe last couple of weeks.\nWe\u2019ve just had our first\n\u2018Rep Academy\u2019, which\ndiffers from how training\nin previous years was\ndone. We\u2019ve set aside\na day for it, with group\nsessions and then splitting different sessions\nfor different groups of\nreps depending on what\nthey need to know \u2013 e.g.\nseparate sessions for\nwellbeing and academic\nreps \u2013 and then everyone\ncoming back together\nfor a skills workshop. In\nprevious years, training\nwas done over several\nevenings over the three\nweeks post-elections.\nThis way, reps get a lot\nmore of a social aspect\nto it, and everyone is in\nthe same room together\nsharing ideas and contri-butions. We put a lot of\neffort into training reps,\nand it\u2019s very time-inten-sive, but we do it because\nof this \u2013 because their\ninsights are so valuable.\nIt\u2019s pointless to elect reps\nif we don\u2019t equip them to\ndo the roles.\nThere does need to\nbe work done to keep\nimproving and understanding what reps need\nfrom us, so we\u2019ll be using\nfeedback. We also want to\nbe a lot more timely next\nyear \u2013 faculty and dep\nreps are elected in March,\nso waiting until October\nto do training isn\u2019t ideal.\nAnd CU President training\nneeds to be looked at \u2013 we\ndon\u2019t think including them\nin two random days of\nOT training is useful, but\nwaiting until October just\ndoesn\u2019t work for them, as\nthey especially are really\nin the thick of it from\nAugust onwards. There\u2019s\na really strong attitude\nfrom this year\u2019s OTs that\nthe Union is only as strong\nas its volunteers \u2013 we\u2019re\nreally trying to bring them\ninto decisions more and to\nensure they\u2019re equipped to\ndo what they need to do.\nFelix: And you\u2019re also\nlooking at reforming\nsome of those roles \u2013\nspecifically the Liberation Officers?\nCurrently, the Liberation\nOfficers are very senior\nroles in the Union \u2013 on par\nwith faculty reps and management chairs \u2013 but they\ndon\u2019t fall into any other\nstructures. If anything\nunder their remit needs\nto get done, it\u2019s just on\nthem to do it. That means\nboth that if they can\u2019t do\nit alone, it doesn\u2019t get\ndone, and that they aren\u2019t\nreceiving support or inter-linkage with others who\nmight want to help. That\u2019s\njust not good enough,\neither for the rep or for the\nstudents relying on their\nLiberation Officers to be\nable to do things.\nIn 2016-17, an external\ncompany was brought in\nto review liberation in the\nUnion, and they had some\ngreat suggestions \u2013 many\nof which haven\u2019t yet been\nimplemented. I want to\nlook at it in a more holistic\nway \u2013 what does it need to\nsucceed if we really want\nto represent, campaign\nfor, build communities in\nthese groups. The kind of\nincremental changes done\nby my predecessors won\u2019t\naddress this problem.\nThis is one area where\nbenchmarking against\nother universities is really\nhelpful, so I\u2019ve been\ndoing that, and it gave\nme some ideas of where\nwe can go and how to\nrestructure. The desire for\nchange was really clear at\nthe first Community and\nWelfare Board meeting\na couple of weeks ago,\nand we gathered good\nfeedback. We\u2019ll also look\nto liaise with other groups\nwho may have a stake,\nsuch as iQ or ACS.\nI\u2019m aiming for January as\na very ambitious deadline,\nso that if there need to be\nchanges to the description\nof the Liberation Officer\nroles they\u2019re ready for the\nelections in Spring.\nFelix: You also mentioned the Athena\nSwan and Race\nEquality Charter?\nBoth of these, the former\nold and the latter rather\nnew, are essentially\n\u2018awards\u2019 given to higher\neducation institutions for\nboth their future plans\nand their implementation\nof past plans toward\nmaking positive changes\nfor female and for BAME\nstudents and academics.\nIt\u2019s very much not just\nabout hitting some quota\nof students, but rather\nwhat the College is doing\nto genuinely improve the\noverall experience \u2013 every\nsingle aspect.\nI\u2019ve been helping with\nthe applications \u2013 this\nyear, Imperial is seeking\nto maintain its Silver\nstandard for the Athena\nSwan, and to be accepted\nfor the Racial Equality\nCharter as this is its first\nyear.\nFelix: Why is the College not aiming for\nGold?\nIn short, to be realistic.\nVery very few institutions\nhave the Gold award, and\nthough there were discussions about it, it was\ndecided that we aren\u2019t at\nthat point yet.\nThe Chemistry depart-ment, however, is one of\nonly a few holders of a\ndepartmental Gold Aware\nin the country! It\u2019s very\nvery prestigious.\nFelix: What is your\ninvolvement with the\napplications?\nI\u2019m involved both in\nworking groups investigating specific things for\nthe sake of the applica-tions, as well as being part\nof \u2018self-assessment teams\u2019\nalong with other Union\nmembers like the Gender\nEquality or BAME\nOfficers. We\u2019ve been\nrunning focus groups, but\nthe attendance has been\nvery poor \u2013 and we need\nto dig into the reasons\nbehind that, because\nmaybe that\u2019s emblematic\nof a problem faced by\nsome students. Perhaps\nmany students aren\u2019t\ncomfortable talking about\nthese things. For now,\nwe need to rethink how\nstudents will be involved,\nbecause we can\u2019t pull\nuseful information out of\npoorly-attended sessions.\nFelix is recruiting!\n\n"

As crimes\ncommitted by foreign\nnationals are not punishable under Hong Kong\nlaw, there arose a need\nto amend this loophole.\nHowever, Carrie Lam\n(current HK Chief Executive) tried to ram the bill\nthrough, which worsened\npublic sentiment and\nreinforced beliefs of the\nerosion of Hong Kong\u2019s\nautonomy. This sparked\nthe protests, as public\nopinion was once again\nmanipulated. The origin\nof the bill however, was\nnot unreasonable.\nFurthermore, the Hong\nKong police have been\nmarkedly restrained in the\nface of blatant violence\nby the protestors. In any\nother country, incidents\nsuch as violence targeting policemen and\npolicewomen would have\nresulted in martial law,\nas the case was in Baltimore! In Hong Kong,\nprotestors have caused\ngrievous injuries such as\nslashing police officers,\nmaking bombs, doxxing\npolice officers (who are\nHong Kong citizens as\nwell) and sending death\nthreats to their families.\nProtestors/rioters have\nalso tried to steal the\nguns of the officers they\nattacked! At this point\nany country would have\ndeclared martial law.\nHowever, Hong Kong\u2019s\nadministration is para-lyzed. Under the central\ngovernment\u2019s directive, it\ncannot do anything, while\ninternational media sensa-tionalizes and demonizes\nit. There has been surprisingly continuous media\ncoverage of the protests\nin Hong Kong while the\nopposite has happened for\nthe yellow shirt protests\nin Paris, where similar\nviolence erupted with 11\nfatalities. The restraint\nand conduct shown by\nHong Kong\u2019s police is\nadmirable despite the\ninsidious tactics used by\nthe protestors.\nI believe that the\nlonger the riots/protests\ngo on, the bleaker Hong\nKong\u2019s future becomes.\nThe reason China has\nnot intervened yet was\nbecause they know this.\nAs violence grips the city,\nbusinesses and funds have\nbeen considering leaving\nthe city. Retail sales have\nbeen down 23% year-on-year, tourism has been\ndown. Goldman Sachs\nestimates that since the\nprotests broke out in June\nabout $3 billion to $4\nbillion has left the city\nfor Singapore. If this con-tinues, within 10 years,\nHong Kong will have no\nsignificance left. China\ndoes not really need Hong\nKong as badly as 30 years\nago. The Shanghai stock\nexchange market has now\naccelerate this process.\nForeign interference in\nthe issues of Hong Kong\nis also clear, as evidenced\nby the photographs of\nprotest leaders with\nleading Western officials\nand diplomats and NED\n(National Endowment\nfor Democracy) funding\nof Hong Kong\u2019s National\nDemocratic Institute. This\nwill only further incite\nthe wrath of the mainland\ncitizenry and government.\nAs an ethnic Chinese\nliving overseas (I am not\nborn in China, but I do\nidentify as Chinese), I\ncould have sympathized\nwith the protestors had\nthey not shown such\ndisrespect towards their\ncountry: stamping,\nburning the Chinese flag,\nwaving flags of the US\n\u201cIn the end,\nHong Kong is\nChina.The very\nfirst Article of\nthe Basic Law\nstates so...\u201d\novertaken it, while the\nShenzhen one is catching\nup fast at #8.

These\ntraits are what I took away\nafter 22 months.\nXerxes Chong Xian\n(On his experience of\nBasic Military Training)\nA typical day starts as\nearly as 5 in the morning,\nwhen across the bunks\na flurry of activity is set\noff as recruits scramble\nto wash up and assemble.\nCommanders do not take\nlateness lightly, with\npunctuality measured\ndown to the second.\nPush-ups, pull-ups,\nsit-ups, and timed runs\nare the bread and butter\nof any day\u2019s activities.\nI recall fondly my company\u2019s pre-meal routine,\nwhere each recruit had\nto complete a minimum\nnumber of pull-ups before\nthe platoon could proceed\nfor meals.\nWith Singapore\u2019s strict\ngun laws, most Singaporeans have never seen a\ngun in person \u2013 let alone\nhandled one \u2013 making the\n\u2018Weapon Presentation\u2019 a\nmomentous occasion for\neach recruit.\nPerformed under the\ncover of darkness, symbolically representing the\nneed to shield an army\u2019s\nassets from the prying\neyes of the enemy, each\nrecruit is presented with\nthe iconic SAR-21 assault\nrifle. Affectionately\nreferred to as our \u201cwives\u201d,\na soldier is rarely seen\nwithout it by his side.\nThe dreaded field camp\nrepresents the climax of\nBasic Military Training.\nRecruits will head into\nthe jungle to hone their\nindividual fieldcraft,\nwhere they would be at\nthe mercy of the elements.\nTorrential downpours,\nblistering tropical sun,\ndense undergrowth, and\nhumidity so palpable it\nfeels like your thickest\nwinter coat is strangling\nyou. Digging of \u2018shell\nscrapes\u2019 (shallow trenches\nwhich also doubled as\nour beds), combat movements as a section, and\nsituational tests result in a\nbone-tired, mud-encrust-ed soldier at the end of\neach day. Encounters with\nsnakes, scorpions and\nthe occasional wild boar\nadd to the flavour of the\nexperience.\nMy nights were spent\ncomfortably nestled in my\nfar from civilisation, a\ntilt of the head leaves one\nenthralled by the millions\nof bright stars dotting the\nnight sky. This coupled\nwith the tranquility of the\nrainforest and the lull of\nits nocturnal inhabitants\noffered a brief respite\nfrom the most arduous\nportion of basic training.\nSean Chai (OCS)\nMany recruits would\nprobably describe the\n\u2018tough times\u2019, so here\u2019s\nmy take on the funnier\nside of the experience.\nHere are the top 2 \u2018LOL\u2019\nmoments in my NS life.\nAmbushing the enemy\nwith his pants down (lit-erally): sometimes the call\nof nature is just too strong\nand when you\u2019re out in\nthe wild, the jungle is your\ntoilet. Trying to conceal\nour movement, we slowly\nleopard-crawled towards\nthe enemy position \u2013\ntaking care not to alert\nthem to our presence.\nOnce we were within\nfiring distance, we readied\nour rifles and tried to\nspot the enemy through\nour scopes. Expecting\na highly camouflaged\nand entrenched enemy\nposition, little did we\nexpect 2 bare bottoms\nfacing us. Needless to\nsay, we caught them off\nguard and completed the\nmission successfully.\nThen there was the\n\u2018jungle chef\u2019 incident:\nsometimes the lack of\nfood messed with our\nminds. Infantry officer\ncadets go through a three-day survival training\ncourse where they learn to\nlive off the land and build\nshelters from available\nmaterials. During this\ntime they are required to\ndemonstrate certain skills\nthey have been taught, including the identification\nand preparation of plant\nfood \u2013 in this case the\nSimpoh Ayer leaf. Typically, the leaf is prepared\nfor consumption by\nboiling. The lack of food\nmust have gotten to one\nparticular cadet because\nhe decided to roast the\nleaf, placing it directly\nabove the fire, almost\nsetting fire to it and the\nsurrounding structures he\nbuilt.\nDespite national\nservice being a compulsory two-year thing, on\nthe brighter side it has\nleft us with these fond\nmemories. Also, they give\nyou free food, clothes,\nand housing, plus the\noccasional allowance.\nWhat\u2019s not to like?\n\u201cMy nights\nwere spent\nnestled in my\nshell scrape,\nclutching\nmy rifle and\ncontemplating\nmy very moist\nexistence\u201d\nT\nhe UK stopped\nNational Service\n(NS) in 1963.\nBefore that,\nfrom the ages of 18-21,\nall males were required\nto serve in the Armed\nServices for 18 months.\nIn some countries,\nhowever, service is still\nrequired.

This is not only the\ntruth in George Orwell\u2019s\n1984 but also in The\nCapture, where as a\nsuspect your every move\nis being watched, your\nphone calls listened to,\nyour locations tracked.\nOne key conflict centers\naround the fact that sur-veilled content is considered inadmissible in court,\nwhich is used to justify\nthe approach of \u201ccorrection,\u201d where footages are\nfalsely altered to convict\nsuspects. It is truly ironic\nthat The Capture begins\nwith the discharge of a\ncriminal (whom we later\nfound out did commit the\ncrime) and ends with an\ninnocent man taken into\ncustody, both on the basis\nof faulty video evidence.\nConsider this: CCTV\nevidence is often perceived as one of the most\ntrusted, objective source.\nWith the introduction of\n\u201cdeepfakes,\u201d where one\u2019s\nimage is superimposed\nonto a source material\nwith machine learning,\nhas video evidence lost its\nobjectivity it once had?\nDoes the end ever\njustify the means?\nWidely explored in\nmedia, famously in 12\nAngry Men, the presumption of innocence\nserves as the basis of our\nsystem of justice and is a\nlegal right of the accused\nin a trial. This is another\ntheme echoing throughout\nthe story and serves as\nthe primary motivator\nfor Roberts, plotting to\nexpose the practice of correction in the intelligence\nworld. In The Capture,\nRoberts, a human rights\nlawyer, seeks to defend\nher Islamist client Faisal\nDahmani who was taken\ninto custody based on\naltered footage proving\nDahmani a terrorist.\nThe intelligence service\nthinks otherwise based on\nwiretaps and intercepts\nthat are inadmissible\nin court and falsifies\nCCTV footage to convict\nDahmani. Here we are\nforced to ask, do the\nends justify the means?\nThe service claims to\nsave thousands of lives\nremoving terrorist threats\nas such. Does prioritising\nthe so-called safety justify\nthe violation of privacy?\nDoes it justify falsifying\nevidence? Does it justify\none\u2019s life, one\u2019s integrity,\none\u2019s innocence?

Although I have\na preference for the\ntypical happily-ever-after\nendings or at least one\nwhere justice is served,\nI have to admit Ben\nChanan\u2019s conclusion\nto the multi-layered\nconspiracy wraps up the\nseries well, leaving room\nfor the audience to decide\nfor themselves between\nthe dichotomy of human\nrights or lives, rather than\nforcefully imposing an\nopinion or the other.\nFinal thoughts\nAllinall,Iwouldwholeheartedly recommend\nthis conspiracy thriller\nto anyone, especially to\nthriller enthusiasts like\nmyself. It\u2019s a quest after\ntruth and fairness; it sheds\nlight on numerous controversial topics yet covers\neach with such depth and\nthoughtfulness.

Since then we\u2019ve\nbeen waiting eagerly for\nhis third album.\nTwo years in the spotlight appears to have left\nRex a little shell shocked.\nMuch of the focus of Pony\nis his struggle in new\nenvironments and being\nseparated from those he\nloves. While this shift has\ncertainly left him with\nsome good material to\nwrite about, it seems as\nthough it\u2019s also caused a\nrift in his style. The \u201chazy\nSunday morning\u201d charm\nof his older material has\nbeen entirely abandoned.\nI hesitate to say this is\nintentional as particular\ntracks on Pony are clearly\ntrying to capture the\ncushy/youthful energy of\nbedroom pop \u2013 \u201c10/10\u201d,\n\u201cNever Had The Balls\u201d\nand \u201cFace To Face\u201d. All\nthose songs fuckin\u2019 slap\nthere\u2019s no denying, but\nthey\u2019re missing a soul.\nPossibly the style didn\u2019t\nhold its colours through\nthe wash of label and\nexecutive influence.\nEven worse, songs like\n\u201cAlways\u201d and \u201cStressed\nOut\u201d are void of originality and drone on in places.\nWhile the bedroom\npop themes suffer,\nRex\u2019s larger sounding\norchestral-infused tracks\nare doing him wonders.\nThe power supplied by\nRCA records has granted\nhim access to expand\nthe amount he uses large\nnumbers of instruments.\nThe utilisation of weightier instrumentation appears\nacross the album and is\nmore prominent in tracks\nlike \u201cPluto Projector\u201d\nand \u201cLaser Lights\u201d. Rex\nhits his stride with these\ngrandiose compositions\nin \u201cIt Gets Better\u201d, where\nthe indie and operatic\npop genre influences of\nthe album come together\nbeautifully. There is certainly a comparison to be\ndrawn to operatic/baroque\npop artist Rufus Wainwright, with Rex being\nthe modern-day version.\nRex\u2019s strong storytelling is his main play here,\nbut it leaves a desire for\nmore creative wordplay.\nThere are a few great\ntongue-in-cheek lines\nthat catch you off guard \u2013\n\u201cSometimes you gotta cut\na bitch out\u201d. Also a few\nget you in the feels \u2013 \u201cI\nopen up when shit gets\nbuilt up this high/ She\nmakes it easy to cry\u201d.\nThe album displays\nmany of Rex\u2019s strongest\ntraits, unfortunately just\nnot the best instances.\nTrack-by-track the album\nlacks consistency as it\nfails to walk the tightrope\nof jolly and depressed.\nHopefully Rex\u2019s next\nproject can be pointed in\na clearer direction.\nW\nith their\ns e c o n d\na l b u m ,\nCigarettes\nAfter Sex are back with\nmore noir dream-pop,\nechoey guitars, and\namazing vocals. Greg\nGonzalez sounds deep in\nlove, as he whispers the\nlyrics, slow-as-molasses,\nin songs like \u201cPure\u201d &\n\u201cTouch\u201d. His penchant for\nlovely, lilting melodies,\nand the sound, with the\nloud bass and interlocking\nguitar lines, give a rich\ntexture to the nine tracks,\nwhich progressively cascade into different stages\nof a relationship, similar\nto mini-narratives, about\nrandom sexual encounters\nand misadventures.\nSongs like the dusky\n\u201cHeavenly\u201d or the elegant\n\u201cFalling in Love\u201d are\nhypnotic, but the hooks\nare splendid examples of\nsongwriting. The former\nopens with a sound that\ncarries a slight amount of\nurgencyinit,accompanied\nby the bass and the vocals\nthat work off of each\nother gorgeously before\nwaves of guitar punctuate\nthe softness of the chorus\n(\u201cBecause this is where\nI want to be/Where it\u2019s\nso sweet and heavenly\u201d).\nAlthough the humour that\nwas present in the earlier\nalbum has been replaced\nby a deeper sincerity,\neven the song, \u201cHentai\u201d,\nthe Japanese anime form\nof pornography, feels like\na contemplation on love,\nwith Gonzalez crooning\nthe words \u201cBeautiful\nhearts are in your eyes\u201d,\nand makes you wonder if\nit\u2019s meant for someone or\nsomething.\nSonically, the new\nalbum sounds like an\nimpressive collection. It\u2019s\nquite easy to write a bunch\nof slow songs with similar\nchords, but the band is\nimmensely talented and\ntheir work has a certain\ntruth and sadness that\nhelps them create a record\nthat feels as smooth as silk\nand moves in a way that is\nsimilar to a well-directed\nmovie, and even though\nsome critics say that every\nsong sounds the same,\nit\u2019s their similarities that\nbecome their strengths,\ngradually setting a hazy,\nunshakable mood. \u201cAll\nthe blatantly audible\ninfluences become irrel-evant, leaving Cigarettes\nAfter Sex with a sound\nof its own, created with\nscant tools and seemingly\nminimal effort. Like the\nbest sleight of hand magi-cians, the trick\u2019s conjured\nbefore you, then gone.\u201d,\none of the critics claimed.\nWhere most indie and\npop bands often overshadow their lead vocalist in\necho, reducing them to just\nanother component within\nthe wistful drift of sound,\nGonzalez is the centre of\nattention here. Cigarettes\nAfter Sex\u2019s sound is the\ntrademark loud bass and\ninterlocking guitar lines,\nwhich are very clearly\ndefined \u2013 but there\u2019s no\ndoubt that the focus is\nGonzalez and the lyrics.\nThe album washes you\nover with a drowsy haze,\nthe kind of feeling you\nget when you stay up all\nnight, talking to someone,\nand the words fill your\nheart with a certain\nlonging, and through\nwallowing in its own mire\nand coming out the other\nside, Cry becomes one of\nthose restrained albums\nwhere tempo, repetition,\nand muted composition\nconstruct an entire story\nwithin the pauses between\nthe notes and the ideas\nbetween the lines.\nISSUE 1732\nFELIX\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n19\nMUSIC\nGuthrie Ruby\nMusic Editor\nArtist: Rex Orange County.\nLabel: RCA Records.\nTop Tracks: 10/10; Pluto\nProjector; It Gets Better.\nFor Fans Of: Benny Sings;\nCuco; Rufus Wainwright. 34\nminutes.\nPony\nCigarettesAfter Sex - Cry:Acollection of ruminations\non love\nMUSIC\nAmbika Bharadwaj\nMusic Writer\nArtist: Cigarettes After Sex.\nLabel: Partisan Records.\nTop Tracks: Pure; Touch.\nFor Fans Of: Alvvays;\nJapanese Breakfast; Yellow\nDays. 40 minutes\nCry\nThis is what your lungs look like after cigarettes after\nsex // Pitchfork\n\u201cThe\u2018hazy\nSunday\nmorning\u2019\ncharm of\nhis older\nmaterial has\nbeen entirely\nabandoned.\u201d\nThinking about the good ol\u2019days // Pitchfork\n\n"

Same-sex\nmarriage was legalised in\nEngland & Wales in 2013\nand 2014 in Scotland.\nUnfortunately, neither of\nthese rights fully extend\nto Northern Ireland.\nIn July, the UK government introduced the\nNorthern Ireland Executive Formation Bill in\nthe UK Parliament. This\nwas a largely technical\nand politically neutral\nlegal instrument required\ndue to the ongoing suspension of the Northern\nIrish Assembly as the\nNationalists and the Unionists could not agree\non a power sharing\ndeal in 2017. For over\n1000 days, Northern\nIreland has been running\nwithout a government\nand no legislation could\nhave been passed in the\nNI Assembly.\nTwo Labour MPs submitted two amendments\nto the Bill, forcing the\nlaws legalising abortion\nand same-sex marriage\nto be extended to\nNorthern Ireland unless\nthe NI Assembly can\nresume sitting before\n21st October with a\ngovernment formed.\nNo power-sharing deal\nwas agreed and no\ngovernment could be\nformed. Now the UK\ngovernment will have\nto elevate abortion right\nand marriage equality\nin Northern Ireland to\nthe same standard as the\nrest of the UK by April\n2020.\nThe island of Ireland\nhas been notorious for\nits ultra-conservative\nstance on social libera-tion, with the Republic\nbeing generally worse\noff than the North.\nDivorce was, bizarre-ly, not allowed in the\nRepublic until in 1995,\nwhen the Irish people\nvoted in favour of\ndivorce rights by 50.3%\nto 49.7%. In both the\nNorth and the Republic,\ncarrying out abortion\nwas punishable by life\nimprisonment unless the\nlife of the mother was\nthreatened. So says the\nlaw, however in 2012,\na Galway resident was\nrefused abortion despite\nher deteriorating health.\nShe died of sepsis 5 days\nlater.\nThe table has turned\nin recent years, with\nthe Republic legalising\nsame-sex marriage\nin 2015 and allowed\nabortion on-demand in\n2018. These archaic laws\nremained in Northern\nIreland. It should be\nnoted, however, that\nsame-sex couples in\nNorthern Ireland were\nable to obtain civil\npartnership status since\n2004. Starting from June\n2017, NHS England also\nprovides free abortion\nservice to Northern Irish\nresidents with travel\ncosts reimbursed. This\narrangement is certainly\nwelcomed, but it came\nfar too late and can\nhardly be considered\naccessible, especially\nfor women in vulnerable\ngroups.\nIn 1967, legislations\nfrom Westminster generally applied to the whole\nof the United Kingdom.\nNorthern Ireland was\nexplicitly excluded from\nthe Act decriminalising\nabortion. Since the\nlate 1990s, devolved\nlegislatures were set up\nin Wales, Scotland and\nNorthern Ireland with\nWestminster devolving\nnumerous powers to\nthese regional assem-blies. Abortion and\nmarriage are among\nthese devolved matters\n(except for Wales).\nSame-sex marriage was\nmade legal in England\nand Wales in 2013, with\nthe Scottish parliament\npromptly following\nsuit in early 2014.\nThe Northern Irish\nassembly voted 4 times\nto legalise same-sex\nmarriage since 2012,\nwith all being defeated\nby a narrow margin.\nIn 2015, legalisation\nof same-sex marriage\nfinally received majority\nsupport in Stormont,\nhowever this vote was\nnullified through an\nabuse of petition of\nconcern.\nIronically, the biggest\ndevil in the play is the\nDemocratic Unionist\nParty. As the name\nsuggests, the DUP\nsupports Northern\nIreland remaining in the\nUnited Kingdom with\nstrengthening ties with\nGreat Britain. With what\nI regard as one of the\nmost egregious political\nhypocrisy currently in\nexistence, the DUP stood\nconsistently opposed\nto abortion rights, a\npolicy adapted, accepted\nand taken as norm by\nmillions of Britons for\nmore than half a century,\nand arguably, one that\ndistinguishes whether a\ncountry is living in the\npresent or past . The\nDUP has also consistently opposed same-sex\nmarriage, a policy that\nonce again, is widely\nsupported across the\nUK.\nThe Nationalist camp\nis mostly supportive of\nsocial liberation, despite\nhaving a strong tie with\nCatholicism through its\npro-Irish Reunification\nvoter base. Sinn F\u00e9in,\nthe largest nationalist\nparty, had a reserved\nstance on abortion\nrights until ultimately in\n2018, adopted a stance\nto allow abortion on\ndemand. Sinn F\u00e9in has\nalso supported same-sex\nmarriage, while refusing\nto form a government\nwith the DUP unless they\nagree to work towards\nmarriage equality. SDLP\nlabelled themselves\na motion \u201cThat this\nAssembly agrees that\nthe legislative position\non abortion in Northern\nIreland will most appropriately be determined\nby the Northern Ireland\nAssembly\u201d. Or, in other\nwords, \u201cwe\u2019ll abuse\nthe procedure to block\nit even if decriminali-sation of abortion gets\nmajority support in the\nAssembly, just like what\nwe did with same-sex\nmarriage.\u201d\nIndeed there are few\nmajor parties in Western\nEurope with such a hardline regressive ideology,\nand even fewer parties\nthat openly take pride\nin such fundamentalism.\nThe DUP\u2019s stance is not\nthe path history takes,\nand they will promptly\nbe remembered as the\nantagonist in the struggle\nfor social liberation.\nas \u201cpro-life\u201d although\ngave MLAs free vote\non the matter. SDLP has\nalso voted in favour of\nmarriage equality in all\nthe 5 votes tabled to the\nAssembly between 2012\nand 2015.\nPut it this way: you\nknow you are probably\nin the wrong when\nCatholic sympathisers\nare more socially liberal\nthan you. The DUP\nunfortunately doesn\u2019t\nget it, and continued\nits attempt to sabotage\nsocial progression even\nafter the UK Parliament\nhas affirmed its stance.\nThe DUP requested\nthe NI Assembly to\nbe summoned on 21st\nOctober, on the deadline\nset out by the NI Executive Formation Act.\nThis was of course\nfutile as a government\ncouldn\u2019t possibly have\nbeen formed on the day.\nThe DUP has also tabled\nAn Abortion Protest // Flickr: Studio Incendo\nFELIX ISSUE 1732\n\n"

There was a clear\nregional divide in election\nresults, with a complete\nloss of Liberal (Trudeau\u2019s\nparty) seats in the Western\nprovinces of Alberta and\nSaskatchewan (dubbed\n\u2018wexit\u2019) and a surge in\nBloc Quebecois (a Quebec\nindependence party)\nsupport, with the party\nattaining 30 seats from 10\nin 2015 and supplanting\nthe NDP as the secondary\nopposition in parliament.\nAs the second largest\ncountry in the World,\nCanada naturally has\na diverse and fairly\ndisparate electorate. For\nexample, the Greater\nToronto area (GTA),\nwhere 18.81% of the\npopulation of Canada live\nhas 43 ridings (the equivalent of constituencies)\nwhereas the 2.1 million\nsq km Arctic territory of\nNunavut only has one.\nThis naturally means that\nmetropolitan areas have\nthe largest amount of clout\nin the federal elections\ndue to increased population density. Trudeau\u2019s\nliberal party gained all\nbut three ridings in the\nGTA - whilst historically a\nlocal majority of this scale\nwould have gained him a\nfederal win, the gains of\nBloc Quebecois and the\nConservatives prevented\na majority.\nThe needs of the\nCanadian electorate as\na whole are incredibly\ndiverse, a product of\na multitude of factors\nincluding geography,\nindustry and the history\nof the province and its\npeople. Those in Nunavut\nare at the forefront of the\neffects of climate change,\nand have an extortionately\nhigh cost of living. Blue\ncollar workers in the\nwestern provinces where\nTrudeau performed so\npoorly view environmental policy as squandering\nthe plentiful oil sands and\nresources of the country,\nat the expense of their\njobs (this animosity links\nback to Trudeau\u2019s father,\nwho in 1973 asked provinces to freeze oil prices,\nmaking them unable\nto sell higher prices).\nFirst Nations Canadians\n(indigenous Canadians)\ncontend with a lack of\naction following the\ninvestigation into missing\nand murdered indigenous\nwomen that resulted in the\ninvestigating commission\ncalling the increased rate\nof homicide of indigenous women tantamount\nto genocide. Trudeau\nmandated the missing and\nmurdered women inquiry,\nbut has done little to act\nwider World. The production of the pipeline also\nplaces Trudeau in further\ncontempt with the First\nNations community, who\nwould be posed to lose\nout significantly in terms\nof land and disruption in\nits construction, a further\nblow to Trudeau\u2019s credentials and promises to\nSo what of the Bloc\nQuebecois surge? Quebec\nis a province that is\ntraditionally subject to a\nlarge amount of swing,\nhowever the extent of the\nBloc victory was amongst\nthe biggest surprises of\nthe election. The province\nhas a degree of diplomatic\nrepresentation, with\noffices in various countries and separate representation in Canadian\ndelegations. In 1995 a\nreferendum on Quebec\nhaving a sovereignty\nagreement (a step below\noutright independence)\nwas narrowly defeated,\nthe culmination of years\nof constitutional conflict.\nWhether the bloc surge\nindicates increased public\ndesire for independence is\nunclear - the main cities of\nQuebec City and Montreal\nremained Conservative\nand Liberal respectively,\nand given that many seats\nwere gained from the\nNDP, whose stake in the\nprovince has been dwindling for the past 3 federal\nelections, the gains may be\nmore complicated. Recent\npolls suggest that 82% of\nquebecers believe that the\nprovince should remain\nin Canada, and the Bloc\ncampaigned primarily on\nenvironmental and other\nissues unrelated to sepa-ratism. So all indicators\nsuggest there won\u2019t be a\nsecession anytime soon.\nThis election is also\nthe first since a landmark\nsupreme court ruling\nearlier this year that\nallows all Canadian\ncitizens abroad who were\n\u201cThere is\na complex\nbalance to\nbe made in a\ncountry that is\nsimultaneously rich in fossil\nfuels and\nmelting polar\nice caps\u201c\npreviously resident in the\ncountry to vote in their old\nriding, no matter how long\nthey have lived away from\nCanada. Given that there\nare ~3 million Canadian\ncitizens abroad, this could\npotentially represent a\nlarge minority of the\nelectorate. However the\nimpact of this ruling is not\nyet and not set to be clear,\nas expats are not grouped\nas a voting bloc, and the\nCanadian government has\nnot published any data\nIrish Border Road Closure Warning // Geograph.ie\nThoughts and analysis on Trudeau\u2019s minority government loss from an Authentic Canadian\non the number of expat\nvoters.\nIn short, no Canadian\nPrime Minister can win\nover everyone - there is\na complex balance to be\nmade in a country that\nis simultaneously rich in\nfossil fuels and melting\npolar ice caps, and is\nmarred by the legacy and\nartefacts of colonialism,\nfrom the state mandated\ncultural genocide of native\npeoples to the continuing\nbattle for Quebec inde-pendence. Trudeau has\nthus far been lacklustre\nin majority government,\nand his reelection has\nproduced a country politically divided. Let\u2019s see\nwhat he can do in the next\nterm.\n\u201cIf not built, Alberta is forecast\nto go into a recession...\nhowever building a transnational pipeline is counter to\nthe environmentalist image\nTrudeau wishes to portray\non the 231 \u2018imperative\nchanges\u2019 it concluded\nwith. The use of the term\ngenocide has also proved\ncontentious for Trudeau,\nwho declined to endorse\nthat aspect of the report,\nyet used the term in a\nspeech to describe the\nissue.\nThe production of\nthe TMX oil pipeline is\ndemonstrative of many\nof the geographical and\ncultural conflicts in\nCanadian politics.

(Yes, I lied,\nI still had one more in\nme.) They aren\u2019t stingy\nwith their toppings. The\nherbs on the pizzas we\ngot were front and centre\nwhen it came to flavour.\nThe peppers and onions\nwere sweet and juicy.\nEverything on our plates\nlooked and (most impor-tantly) tasted fresh. If you\nwant, you can watch the\nwhole thing be made from\nscratch in front of you in\ntheir massive stone oven.\nThey rather impressively manage to incorporate the huge device into\ntheir aesthetic for their\nrestaurants. It works as a\nspectacle but doesn\u2019t stick\nout like a sore thumb.\nSpeaking of their aesthet-ic, they do seem to love\ntheir pink.

Rather, it is an\nuncovering of the Haitian\nhistory behind the term\n\u2018Zombi\u2019. The story follows Haitian earthquake\nsurvivor Melissa as she\nbecomes acquainted\nwith the love-struck\nFanny at the elite Maison\nd\u2019\u00e9ducation de la L\u00e9gion\nd\u2019honneur. Alongside\nthe schoolgirls story we\nare taken back to Haiti\nin 1962 where Clairvius\nMackenson Biju is cursed,\nkilled and, with this being\na zombie film, I think you\ncan guess what happens\nnext...\nIt is rare in modern\ncinema to find a picture\nfilmed in Haiti; the\nstunning tranquillity and\nvibrant passion of the\nisland mean that director\nBertrand Bonello\u2019s efforts\npay off gorgeously on-screen. Bonello\u2019s aim\nwas to portray the voodoo\nHaitian zombie origin, as\nevidenced by his comment\nat his Zombi Child Q&Aat\nthe London Film Festival.\nFeeling, however, that it\nwas not within his cultural\njurisdiction to portray it\ndirectly, he invented the\nFrench storyline to tie it\nall together.

The decision\nto straddle the two storylines finally bears fruit\nin the final act where\nconnections between\nClarvius and the girls\nbegin to emerge. Some of\nthe film\u2019s sense of respect\nfor Haiti seems to dissolve\ntowards the end when\nclich\u00e9d Voodoo conventions are used, against\nwhich I had assumed the\nmovie was trying to fight.\nDespite being a docu-drama, Bonello leaves a\nlot to unpack thematically.\nMelissa is classified as\none of the few people\nof colour in her school,\nthanks to Bonello\u2019s\nceaseless panning across\nclassrooms, corridors and\ncanteens to portray the\noverwhelming white homogeneity of the all-girls\nboarding school. When\nMelissa then reveals her\naunt is a Mambo (Voodoo\npriestess), there is a lot\nless tolerance from the\nother girls when she subsequently starts to behave\nstrangely, failing to notice\nthe changes in Fanny.With\na Mambo as an aunty and\nhaving lived through the\n2010 Haitian earthquakes,\nit seems Melissa is made\nto be an abstract symbol\nof 1st and 2nd generation\nHattians living in France.\nBonello is sure to show\nthat Melissa is able to\nconnect well with her\npeers through their music\nand pop culture, while\nalso being reminded by\nfamily not to forget her\norigins.\nUsing Bonello\u2019s words\n\u2018A zombie is someone\nwho keeps their head\ndown\u2019,weseethedifferent\ntypes of \u2018zombie\u2019 we may\nencounter in day-to-day\nlife.

The\nbiggest fire is the Kincade\nFire in the North of\nCalifornia. As of now, the\nfire is only 15% contained\nand has burned at least 74\n000 acres, leaving more\nthan a million citizens\nwithout electricity or\nservice.\nNearly 200 000 people\nhave been ordered to\nleave their homes, while\nan astonishing 4000 firefighters are battling the\nflames. Fire department\nrepresentative Jonathan\nCox says it could take\n\u201cweeks, if not months\u201d to\nextinguish the fires fully.\nIt is becoming more\nand more evident that the\nfrequency and intensity\nof these fires are highly\nlinked to climate change,\nmore specifically they are\nlinked to wind and soil\nconditions.\nIndeed, climate change\nhas led to an average\nincrease of 3 degrees\nFahrenheit for this time\nof year in California.\nThis signifies hotter\nwinds during wildfire\nseason and drier soils.\nThe combination proves\nto have immeasurable\nimpacts on the number,\nsize and power of the\nfires; 15 of the 20 largest\nfires in California history\nhave happened since 2000\nand the area burned has\nincreased by 500%.\nThe current climate\ntrends could signify a\nlonger wildfire season.\nHowever, generally, it is\nuncertain what climate\nchange will mean for the\nfuture. The fires may be\nless frequent, according to\na study by Guzman-Morales and Gershunov from\nJanuary 2019.\nWith powerful natural\ndisasters increasing not\nonly in rate but also in\nproximity to large cities,\nwill the US rethink its\ncurrent Climate plan?\nThe country\u2019s President seems set to leave\nthe Paris agreement as\nsoon as possible; his\nadministration is said to\nbe beginning the official\nwithdrawal from the Paris\naccords on November\nthe 4th.

Food taken into\nspace must fit multiple\ncriteria: be compact, have\na light mass and of course\na high nutritional benefit,\nall while being preserva-ble for a long time period\nand consumable in a\nweightless environment.\nFreeze-drying, or lyoph-ilisation, solves most\nof these problems, and\neven causes less damage\nthan other dehydration\nmethods that use higher\ntemperatures. The product\nmay be pre-treated by\nrevising the formula or\nconcentrating the product\ninpreparationforfreezing.\nNext comes the freezing\nstage, during which the\nmaterial is cooled below\nits triple point (the lowest\npoint at which the solid,\nliquid, and gas phases can\ncoexist) in a rapid manner\nto avoid the formation of\nlarge ice crystals, which\ncan result in poor texture\nand loss of nutritional\nvalue. Finally, drying\noccurs in 2 phases: the\nprimary phase, which\ninvolves lowering the\npressure to a few millibars\nusing a partial vacuum\nand supplying heat to\ncause sublimation of the\nice, and the secondary\nphase, which aims to\nremove unfrozen water\nmolecules by using higher\ntemperatures than the\nprevious step. This results\nin a light, crumbly food\nthat can easily be restored\nby rehydration with water,\n\u201cThe material\nis cooled below\nits triple point\n(...) to avoid the\nformation of\nlarge ice crystals\u201d\n\u201c(...) fruit juices or\nherbal infusions,\nare mixed with\na stabilising\nsurfactant such\nas lecithin or\nmonoglycerides\u201d\nfilling the microscopic\npores caused by the pro-cedure.\nNitrogen ice cream\nNot only used for\nmaking ice cream,\nbut certainly the most\ndelicious way to enjoy\nnitrogen (welcome to\n2019, where we apparently enjoy consuming the\nelements of Group 15), so\nwhat\u2019s the secret? Simple:\na standard ice cream mix\nis made, and then liquid\nN2 is poured in. The temperature of liquid nitrogen\nis -196 degrees Celsius, so\nthe ice cream is frozen extremely rapidly and no ice\ncrystals are formed - resulting in a highly creamy\ntexture (and definitely a\nmuch cooler ice cream\nto brag about). However,\nif not fully evaporated,\nliquid nitrogen can create\nsolid, brittle, glass-like\nshards, so be wary of any\nsketchy-looking offers for\nthis treat.\nPopping boba\nFinally, something\nyou\u2019re likely to have tried\nin your lifetime. No idea\nwhat I\u2019m talking about?\nTwo words: bubble tea\n(although popping boba\nhave also been used as\nfrozen yoghurt or ice\ncream toppings, so hey,\nboba lovers rejoice). If\nyou\u2019ve ever ventured\nbeyond the classic milk\nbubble tea with tapioca\npearls, you might have\neven had bubble tea with\npopping boba. Flavoured,\nusually fruit juice-resem-bling liquids are thoroughly mixed with powdered\nsodium alginate, and then,\ndrop by drop, dripped into\na bowl filled with cold\ncalcium chloride, creating\nsmall spheres which\nwe know as boba. The\nmagic lies in the calcium\nsolution which forms the\nthin, flexible skin of the\nboba, and results in that\ndelightful juicy POP.\nEdible foam\nWe\u2019ve gone through the\nnot relatable, uncommon\nand basic, so now it\u2019s\ntime for a little more class\nwith this Michelin-level\nmolecular gastronomy. To\nunderstand the creation of\nculinary foam, let\u2019s take\na look at its composition:\n2 phases (aqueous and\ngaseous), with a thin film\nat their interface in which\nlarge amounts of gas\nbubbles are essentially\ntrapped - in this way\nsimilar to an emulsion of\nfat and liquid. To generate\nthis, natural flavours,\nsuch as fruit juices, stock,\nor herbal infusions, are\nmixed with a stabilising\nsurfactant, such as lecithin\nor monoglycerides, in\norder to reduce the inter-facial tension between\nthe aqueous and gaseous\nphases of the components\nand facilitate molecule\nadherence. Without this,\nthe forces of liquid and air\nwithin the bubbles would\ncounteract, rupturing the\nbubbles and causing the\nfoam to disintegrate. A\nmechanical force, usually\nwhipping, is then applied\nin order to introduce\nair into the mixture and\ncreate the aforementioned\nbubbles. A network of\ninterconnected films\nbetween bubbles, known\nas lamellae (no, not lamel-lipods biologists\u2026 but\nclose enough I guess?), is\nwhat gives culinary foam\nits relative stability.\nCandyfloss\nIf you\u2019ve never had\ncandyfloss/cotton candy/\nbarbe \u00e0 papa/fairy floss/\ninsert term for that fluffy\npink sugary goodness\nhere, have you even had\na childhood? Anyway\u2026\nlet\u2019s keep this one short\nand sweet. First, specially\nflavoured solid sugar\nis placed into a small\nbowl, melted using a\nheating element, and then\nsqueezed out through tiny\nholes into a larger vessel\nby centrifugal force (yes,\ncentrifuges are not only\nfor RNA extraction). The\nminiscule holes result in\nextremely thin threads of\nsugar, while the instantaneous increase in surface\narea and exposure to\ncooler air means that when\nthey emerge on the other\nside, they are already so-lidified. All that\u2019s left now\nis for the machine operator\nto gather the sugary\nstrands into portions,\nand your horribly-sticky\n-yet-delightful-sugar-co-ma-childhood-memo-ry-concoction is ready to\nconsume.\nIf anyone ever told you\nthat science isn\u2019t cool, let\nthem live without.

An\naverage of $5.1 trillion\nis traded every day, compared to $84 billion traded\ndaily in equities\u2019 markets.\nDollar, Euro, Sterling and all their friends:\nmarkets. The first is to\nbenefit from yields of\ndifferent currencies. The\ncentral bank of each\ncurrency will usually set\na base interest rate, which\nstrongly determines\nthe interest generated\nby saving in a money\naccount of that currency.\nFor instance, if the UK\nwere to raise interest\nrates tomorrow from the\ncurrent 1.75% to 2.25%,\nthen this would make\nsaving in a UK-based\nmoney account far\nmore attractive, and so\ninvestors would rush to\nbuy sterling and take\nadvantage of this, which\nwould increase the\nstrength of the sterling..\nThis opportunity is the\nreal money maker of\nthe currency exchange\nmarkets \u2013 it allows speculators to move money\nto a currency which they\nexpect to pay a higher rate\nof interest. Additionally,\ncurrencies are bought\nand sold for so-called\n\u2018carry trades\u2019 \u2013 hoping to\nprofit off an increase in\nthe value of a particular\ncurrency.\nTo determine whether a\ncurrency is overvalued\ncheaper labour costs in\npoorer countries.\nThe other reason that\ntrading the currency\nmarkets is so profitable\nis that a high level of\nleverage is available, up\nto a magnitude of about\n100:1. For instance, if\nyou had \u00a3100 to invest in\nJapanese Yen, you could\nborrow up to \u00a39990,\nand then invest \u00a310,000\nin Yen. This hugely\namplifies the profits\nand losses which can\nbe made through Forex\ntrading; huge returns\ncan be achieved from a\nsmall amount of starting\ncapital. Moreover, the\ninterest rates charged on\nsuch instruments from\nmultinational companies.\nA peculiarity of the\nforeign exchange market\nis that it is very lightly\nregulated, with none of\nthe clearing houses or\nregulatory institutions\ncharacterising other\nmarkets. Instead, trades\ntake place off the back\nof credit agreements,\nessentially metaphorical\nhandshakes. There is\nno such thing as insider\ntrading in foreign\nexchange markets, it\u2019s\nlegitimate to trade off any\ninformation you happen\nto hold about countries\nand governments.\nRole of world politics\nThe foreign exchange\nmarket is also interesting\nbecause of how strongly\nit is affected by a range\nof macro-economic\nfactors. For instance,\nthe trade war between\nChina and the US led to\nthe dollar strengthening\nagainst the yuan. This\nis because of the two\ncountries, America is a\nnet importer of Chinese\ngoods. The tariffs on\nthese goods mean that\nless will be bought, and\nso the demand for the\nyuan is decreased. Thus,\nor undervalued, forex\ntraders will sometimes\nuse the notion of purchasing power parity.\nThis expresses a measure\nof what the exchange\nrate \u2018should\u2019 be based on\nthe ratio of the cost of a\nbasket of goods in two\ndifferent countries. In\nthe long run, exchange\nrates are expected to\nmove towards rates\nwhich equalise the price\nof a basket of identical\ngoods and services in any\ncountry. An entertaining\nsimplification of this\nmodel is the Big Mac\nindex, which compares\nthe cost of a Big Mac in\nhundreds of countries,\nadjusted for GDP to\naccount for the effect of\nThe Renminbi (RMB) is sometimes known as the Yuan, which is actually a unit of the currency// Neerav Bhatt, Flickr\n\u201cAn average of\n$5.1 trillion is\ntraded every\nday, compared\nto $84 billion\ntraded daily\nin the equities\nmarkets...\u201d\nLike how you might trade\nin sterling for euros before\na trip abroad, large banks\nthe yuan depreciates\nin value against the\ndollar (it can also be\ninterpreted as the dollar\nstrengthening against\nthe yuan). It is worth\nnoting that the effect of\nthe base interest rate on\nthe value of a currency\nis not so straightforward.\nA low interest rate spurs\nconsumer confidence and\nand corporations trade\ncurrencies. They do this\nboth to hedge against\ninternational currency\nand interest rate risks, as\nwell as to speculate on\ngeopolitical events and\ndiversify portfolios. The\nmost common currency\npairs traded on the FX\nmarkets are Dollar-Euro,\nDollar-Yen, and DollarSterling. Additionally,\npopular currencies are\nthe Swiss Franc, the\nAustralian Dollar and the\nNew Zealand Dollar. Note\nthat only floating currencies are traded, not fixed\ncurrencies.\nThere are two main ways\nto make money from\nthe foreign exchange\n\u201cFor instance,\nif you had\n\u00a3100 to invest\nin Japanese\nYen, you could\nborrow up to\n\u00a39990, and\nthen invest\n\u00a310,000 in\nYen\u201d\nforeign exchange transactions for large banks\nand institutions are negli-gible, due to the size and\nliquidity of the market.\nAside from the straightforward spot price on\nforeign exchange rates,\nan eclectic zoo of FX derivatives exists to hedge\nagainst, and speculate\noff, currency risk.\nThe regulators\nUntil 1976, foreign\nexchange rates had\nbeen governed by the\n1944 Bretton Woods\nAgreement between the\nU.S., Canada, Western\nEuropean countries,\nAustralia and Japan.\nThis bound each country\nto keep its country\u2019s\nexchange rate to within\n1% by tying its value\nto the value of gold and\nusing the IMF to settle\ntemporary imbalance of\npayments. The Jamaica\nAgreement tore down the\nBretton Woods Agreement, increasing the\ninstability of the financial\nmarkets for investors, and\nnecessitatingtheadoption\nof financial derivatives\nto hedge against this\nnew risk. Moreover, the\nadvent of globalisation\nincreased the demand for\n\u201c... how\nstrongly it\nis affected\nby a range\nof macroeconomic\nfactors\u201d\nThe Foreign Exchange Market\ngrowth, which is generally positive for the value\nof the currency. However,\nthis is balanced by higher\ninterest rates generating\nforeign investment in\na country, increasing\ndemand for the currency\nand thus it\u2019s strength.\n\n"

A name\nwhich, until re-cently, brought\njoy to many\npeople\u2019s ears. On the 14th\nNovember 2018, this all\nchanged; the release of\nFallout 76 was the beginning of a year of seemingly\nendless controversy. Why\nare we bringing this up\nagain you ask? Well,\nafter all the issues which\nhave cropped up over the\nlast year (which will be\ncovered later) Bethesda\nstill haven\u2019t seemed\nto have learned their\nlesson. Fallout 1st, a new\nsubscription service for\nFallout 76 is coming\nfor the price of \u00a311.99 a\nmonth! Wait\u2026.what?!\nNo \u2013 I am not joking.\nTo fully understand the\nabsolute absurdity of this\nwe must first understand\nwhat went wrong with\nFallout 76. Although, a\nbetter question is probably\nwhat didn\u2019t go wrong!\nFor starters, the premise\nof the game already had\nmany early sceptics when\nannounced during E3\n2018. It is an always-on-line Fallout game with\nno NPC\u2019s and reliance on\nplayer interaction. I think\nmost know all too well the\nissue with always-online\ngames \u2013 trolls \u2013 so many\ntrolls. To make this even\nworse there is a mechanic\nin the game which allows\nfor the production of a\nnuke. These nukes can\nbe fired on the map and\ndestroy someone\u2019s base\nthey have spent HOURS\non.\nThe in-game controversy was not even the worst\npart. A special edition of\nthe game was available\nfor pre-order called the\n\u2018Power Armour Edition\u2019.\nThis edition was sold at\na steep $200, advertising\na canvas duffle bag as\none of its selling points.\nThe issue was that it did\nnot come with a canvas\nbag and instead was a\ncheap tacky nylon bag.\nThis instigated a barrage\nof complaints from the\nfanbase. At first, the\nBethesda support team\nignored the complaints\nuntil they faltered and\nsaid, \u201cWe aren\u2019t planning\non doing anything about\nit.\u201d Clearly, this is not\nhow to handle accusations\nof this nature, so eventually Bethesda relented;\nhowever, the fanbase was\nfar from pleased. Players\n\u201cA new\nsubscription\nservice for\nFallout 76 is\ncoming for the\nprice of \u00a311.99\na month\u201d\n\u201cBoth the\nFallout and\nFallout 76 subReddit\u2019s are\nriddled with\nESSAYS on\nwhy Bethesda\nneeds to take a\nstep back\u201d\nupset about the swapped\nbags were entitled to 500\natoms compensation. To\nput this into perspective,\n500 atoms is worth around\n\u00a35. That\u2019s right!\nIt took until June the\nfollowing year (2019) for\nBethesda to start rolling\nout the promised mer-chandise, 7 months after\ninitially intended\u2026 poor\nform Bethesda. But oh\nboy does it get worse. In\nDecember 2018 Bethesda\ndecided to ban 3 players\nfor supposedly cheating.\nThe players argued that\nthey were using mods but\nnot using them to cheat,\nand as such, it became a\ncase of the player against\nthe developer with no\nconcrete evidence either\nway. To put this to rest,\nBethesda told the players\nthey would be unbanned\nif they each wrote an\nessay on why cheating\nis detrimental to online\ngames. This once beloved\ncompanies\u2019 solution to\npotential cheaters was\nto treat them like school\nchildren; I honestly could\nnot make this up if I tried.\nYou would think after\nthat that they would learn,\nbut no! In April 2019\nBethesda started selling\nRepair Kits in the Atom\nShop. A shop that uses\natoms as currency, which\nas mentioned earlier is\npurchased using real\nmoney. Repair kits measurably affect the game\nand thus it took Bethesda\nless than 6 months to\nbreak their promise of\nonly cosmetic items being\navailable from the Atom\nShop.\nNow this brings us\nto this week, and oh\nboy what a week it has\nbeen for Bethesda. They\nannounced the release of\nFallout 1st, a subscription service to Fallout\n76 which costs \u00a311.99 a\nfast travel point; these\nfeatures arguably should\nhave been in the game\nfrom the get-go. With\nFallout 1st the player also\ngains 1,650 atoms per\nmonth and access to the\nRanger Armour Outfit.\nThis goes to show how\nbadly Bethesda knows\nits audience. The Ranger\nArmour Outfit is from\nFallout: New Vegas, many\nfans favourite game in the\nfranchise, (hilariously\nnot even developed by\nBethesda but instead\nthe original creators of\nFallout, Obsidian). Why\nwould they hide a fan\nfavourite item behind an\nobscene paywall? The\nonly answer to all of this\nis that Bethesda is getting\ngreedy and somehow has\ngotten away with it until\nnow.\nLuckily, players have\nstarted to push back. One\nman, David Chapman\nfrom Indiana, purchased\nthe Fallout 1st domain\nbefore Bethesda could\nand riddled it with satirical explanations of\nwhat is on offer, such as\n\u201cThis sh***y community\nhas been begging for\nthe ability to play alone\nin private worlds since\nbefore the launch of\nFallout 76 (like what a\nFallout game should be),\nand we begrudgingly\nannounce that they are\ncoming to the game with\nFallout F**K YOU 1st.\u201d\nFurther push back\ncan be seen with players\nin-game putting up\nsigns saying \u201cBoycott\nBethesda\u201d. Not only this\nbut both the Fallout and\nFallout 76 sub-Reddit\u2019s\nare riddled with ESSAYS\non why Bethesda needs\nto take a step back and\nre-evaluate themselves.\nIn an industry increasingly surrounded by\nbad business practices\n(looking at you EA,\nUbisoft, Blizzard) you\ncannot help but worry\nwhat the future holds\nwhen even once loved\nBethesda has joined the\nranks of trashy compa-nies. Hopefully, all of\nthe backlash will send a\nmessage, but one can only\nhope.\nOh pip boy, what have they done to you! // Bethesda\nISSUE 1732\nFELIX\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n29\nmonth.

It\nwas fantastic.\nIn his journey Pip,\nplayed by Joseph Payne,\nmeets a colourful assortment of Dickensian characters that each member of\nthe cast captures perfectly.\nJamie Foulkes is the simpering Mr Pumblechook,\nAlice Franziska is the\ncold and cruel Estella and\nGuy Clark presents what\nI can only describe as the\nmost lawyerly lawyer I\nhave ever seen on stage or\nscreen. The cast portrayed\neach caricature perfectly\nintrueDickensianfashion.\nEach member of the cast\nworked to capture the\nexcitement and mystery\nof the plot capturing the\naudience in the world of\nVictorian London, now\nthe sinister dark marshes,\nnow Miss Havisham\u2019s\ndecrepit abode.\nThe set was very\nminimal, the staging\nunusual. The stage was\nin a narrow, long corridor\nbetween two stands.\nThe proximity of the\naudience to the action\ngave the production an\nintimate air which helped\nwith imagining the space\nas it transformed from\nstreet to graveyard. Miss\nHavisham was granted an\nelaborate wheelchair in\nwhich Ibirogba-Olulode\nslumped imperiously. The\ncast, when Pip was lost in\nreverie, whispered from\nthe darkness of the end\nas an atmospheric chorus,\nperfectly rehearsed and\nI\nhad always assumed\nthat \u2018gaslighting\u2019, a\nform of psychological\nmanipulation which\nsystematically breaks\ndown another person\u2019s\ngrip on reality, was a very\nmodern phenomenon.\nImagine my surprise\nwhen I found out that its\netymology derives from\na play first written in\n1938. Gaslight tells the\nstory of a woman, Bella,\nwho is being persuaded\nshe is quite mad by her\nhusband, Jack. He hides\nher possessions, plays\nsadistic tricks on her and\ncontinually threatens her\nwith violence or the mad-house. Mysteriously, she\nalso hears footsteps on the\nforbidden top floor of the\nhouse through the ceiling.\nwill be consist of Bella\nbeing slowly driven out\nof her mind. I\u2019m all for\ndeeply moving theatre,\nbut two hours of this sad\nfate does not sound like\nan appealing prospect,\nespecially as I\u2019ve brought\nmy companion here for\nher birthday. It brings to\nmind that one time when\nI watched 12 Years A\nSlave for my friend\u2019s 15th\nbirthday, which was just\nas uplifting and joyful as\nyou could imagine.\nFortunately, and almost\nentirely out of the blue, a\ndashing police detective,\nplayed by the excellent\nJoe McArdle, shows up\nto save Bella from her\nterrible spouse. It turns out\nthat Jack is an infamous\nmurderer that has shown\nup back at the scene of the\ncrime to recover valuable\ngems he never found in\nthe initial slash and grab.\nThe eponymous gas lights\nfade whenever he ascends\nto the top floor to search.\nHorror ensues! Mostly at\nthe faintly ridiculous, but\nas I will begrudgingly\nadmit, rather clever plot.\nThis particular production of Gaslight laboured\nsomewhat. In the words\nof my companion, \u2018I was\nbored until the detective\nshowed up\u2019. The dialogue\nwas sometimes slow and\nmeandering. Jordan Wallace\u2019s characterisation of\nJack could do with a little\nmore sinister intent and\nJemima Murphy, as Bella,\ncould use a smidgeon\nmore confused lovesick-ness. Nonetheless, the\nplay really got going once\nthe detective appeared on\nthe scene. Striding around\non stage, eliciting laughs\nfrom the crowd, McArdle\nproved to be a wonderfully energetic addition to\nthe production.\nOne factor that they\noveremphasised was\nits inclusion.\nOverall, the play was\na good watch. The clever\nuse of lighting for the\nflickering gas lamps, the\nthrill of the hunt for the\ntreasure and of course, the\ntriumph over the wicked\nhusband by the noble\nforce of the law made for\na pleasant conclusion. Unfortunately, real cases of\ngaslighting do not follow\nsuch a course.

This\nweek I have\nbeen doing\nsomething a bit\ndifferent: I have been religiously playing a mobile\ngame! Now before you\npull out the torches and\npitch-forks, hear me out!\nCytus 2, released January\n2018, is a rhythm game\ndeveloped by Rayark Inc.\nThis game did not seem\nlike much to me at first\nbut once I started playing\nI was instantly hooked.\nIt is relatively simple but\nquickly ramps up in difficulty until you are playing\nat speeds you didn\u2019t even\nthink were possible. The\ngameplay involves a line\nwhich rises and falls on\nthe screen in time with the\nmusic. When the line goes\nover a circle, you press the\ncircle. There are notes that\nyou hold, notes you drag\nand on the hardest difficulty some notes that you\nswipe (surprisingly hard\nat a fast pace). The feeling\nis extremely fluid, once\nyou get into the rhythm\nit becomes second nature\nand is so satisfying. It\ncan be frustrating playing\nvery high difficulty songs\nbut with the difficulty\nranging from 1 to 15,\nthere is a lot of option to\nchoose exactly what pace\nis good for you. I am now\nup to the stage of playing\nlevel 14 songs and I still\nhave not got bored.\nThe game is packed\nfull of original music,\nwith each playable character having a distinct\nstyle, from Dubstep to\nHeavy Metal to Jazz.\nYou start the game with\n5 characters and must pay\n\u00a310 to unlock each new\ncharacter. This seems a bit\nobscene but I have nearly\n100 hours in the game and\nhave not spent a single\npenny yet. That\u2019s right,\nthe game is free!\nCytus 2 shines in its\ngameplay, but the story\nand art style compliments\nit so well that it must be\nmentioned too. The story\nis told through a fictional\nsocial media where\npeople not only message\nand post different stories\nbut also perform virtual\nreality concerts. It starts\nharmless enough but\nquickly devolves into a\nvery dark and twisted\nfuturistic psychological\nmystery. The character\ndesigns are also top-notch\nwith the beautiful pastel\nshades complimenting\nplay by not being too\nhard on the eyes. Anyone\nthat likes rhythm games\nsuch as Osu or TapTap\nRevenge should check\nthis out. Enjoy your week\nand I will see you all next\nFriday!\nPOV: The Ingenuity of the Emulation Community\nT\nhis POV is\ndedicated to the\nbreathtaking (cue\nKeanu Reeves)\ncommunity of coders that\nmake emulation possible.\nFor those unfamiliar with\nthe term, video game\nemulation is the practice\nof running or simulating\ngames on machines that\nthey\u2019re not meant to be\nrunning on \u2013 for example\nrunning Nintendo Game\nBoy Advance Games on\nan iPhone or PS1 games\non a Nintendo Switch. In\nother words, emulation is\nthe mighty techno-sledge-hammer that knocks\ndown the barriers between gaming platforms,\nproviding jailbroken consoles \u2013 consoles that have\nhad their base code edited\n\u2013 with the ability to play\nany type of game. I\u2019ve\nbeen giving it a go with\na PS Vita that has been\ncompletely kitted out with\nan emulator system called\nRetroarch, allowing me\nto play a digital version\nof every single Gameboy\nAdvance game I own.\nThe zanier end of\nthe hobby is putting\nemulators on not only\ndifferent consoles, but\nalso household appliances \u2013 oh yeah, I\u2019m talking\nabout the running \u201ccan\nit run DOOM\u201d joke. The\niconic shooter has become\na benchmark for how far\ngamers will go to ensure\nthe continuation and preservation of their dearest\nmemes. As a result, I\u2019d\ndare to say that with every\npiece of new technology\ncomes greater potential\nfor DOOM memery! If\nthere\u2019s a digital interface,\nit can run DOOM. It\u2019s\nbeen emulated on ATMs,\nThe Touch Bar of a\nMacbook Pro, and even\ncalculators. Just like the\ngame\u2019s protagonist, this\njoke is too angry and\npersistent to die.\nHowever, for all the\npleasantries that I associate with emulation\nthere can also be some\nshady stuff \u2013 in particular,\nviruses. So, so many\nviruses. This especially\napplies when downloading ROMs, which are\nthe files that contain the\ninformation needed to run\nthe game. There are also\nconcerns with piracy, as\none can download ROMs\nfor games they don\u2019t own,\nand the risk of bricking\nyour console while jail-breaking.\nIn short, video game\nemulation is a blessing.\nHowever, it is strongly\nadvised that you research\nit thoroughly before\ngetting started! For those\ninterested in kitting out\nconsoles or even your\ncomputer with the ability\nto emulate old classics,\nthere are a plethora of\nguides online.\nGAMES\nFreddie Ugo\nGames Editor\nGAMES\nConnor Winzar\nGames Editor\nWith great aesthetic and music, there\u2019s little to fault with // Rayark Inc.\nWhen money isn\u2019t enough, withdraw Doom // Youtuber Aussie50\n\n"

Felix breaks\ndown the data with the\nhelp of the Union Elections Team, and spoke to\nthem about what made\nturnout so excellent this\nyear.\nTo break down the data:\nthe total turnout emerged\nat 34.31%, corresponding\nto over 7000 voters for the\nfirst time ever \u2013 a large\nimprovement in a short\ntime, given that last year\nwas the first time 6000\nvoters had been reached.\nThe record was set for\nboth undergraduate and\npostgraduate involvement\n\u2013 especially undergrad-uate, with a 5% increase\nover last year \u2013 and sits\nsignificantly above the\naverage turnout for UK\nuniversities.\nThere\u2019s a sense of\ncompetition at Imperial,\nbetween faculties and\ndepartments \u2013 so let\u2019s take\na look at the best of each\nfor turning out.\nThe Faculty of Engineering blew the competition away with a whopping 40.0% turnout, with\nthe Faculty of Natural\nSciences falling behind\nat only 36.6%. Both,\nhowever, are carrying\ncasting their vote for\nundergraduate representative \u2013 closely followed by\nEngineering again. The\nlowest turnout was 9.04%\nfor postgraduate Medicine\nrep!\nThe position with\nthe highest turnout was,\ncontrary to the norm, a\npostgraduate rep \u2013 spe-cifically, for the Electrical\nand Electronic Engineering: MSc Control Systems\nacademic representative.\n24 out of 27 voters for the\nrole turned out, leaving a\ntruly impressive 88.89%\nturnout. There were five\nmore rep positions with\na turnout above 80%,\nand another eight above\n70% - all of whom more\nthan double the overall\naverage!\nDepartmentally, there\nwere six that broke Engineering\u2019s record, passing\n40% overall turnout.\nThe highest were Earth\nScience and Engineering,\nwith 45.11% turnout,\nfollowed very closely by\nBioengineering at 45.01%\n- with amounts to just a\ncouple of students extra!\nAs a fun fact: the most\nhotly contested role was\nfor International Officer,\nwhich had almost 30\ncandidates and went\nover 20 rounds using the\nSingle Transferrable Vote\nsystem!\nFelix spoke to Keriann\nLee, Head of Student\nVoice and Communications, about who works\non elections and how they\ngenerated more engagement than ever before.\nElections are run by the\nElections Working Group,\nwhich is led by Keriann\nand features a cross-sec-tion of staff from various\nteams. This includes\nrepresentatives from\nthe Systems team, who\nmanage the custom voting\nsystem and built the new\ncomplaints solution;\nfrom Representation and\nActivities, who ensure all\nrelevant positions are in-cluded; and the Marketing\nteam, who raise awareness\nacross the College. There\nare then two DROs, who\ninterpret the rules during\nthe election cycle. It is\nimportant to note that no\nelected positions (such as\nthe Union President and\nDeputy Presidents) are\nallowed to participate, to\navoid risks of conflict of\ninterest, though students\nare consulted via the Governance Committee \u2013 who\noversee timelines and\nhave general oversight \u2013\nand the Union Council,\nwho determine the by-laws.\nThe collection of this\ngroup of interdisciplinary\npeople requires a tight-ly-managed effort to pull\ntogether \u2013 and this year,\nthey made several changes\nto increase participation.\nAs Keriann said:\n\u201cThere have been a\nnumber of improvements\nto our elections over\nthe past year and a half.\nWe have tighter project\nmanagement with dates\nfor each poll set well in\nadvance and laser-like\nfocus of the project team\nseveral weeks ahead\nof the event; we have\nstreamlined our complaints procedure to make\nit both easier to use from\na student standpoint, but\nalso easier to manage in-ternally, with non-student\nfacing managers serving\nas DROs and a separate\nstaff member handling\nqueries specifically.\u201d\nWith regards to turnout,\nthere have also been more\ndirect changes. \u201cWe now\nspend more time during\nthe nominations process\nensuring that students\nunderstand the roles, why\nthey are important, and\nwhat the commitment is.\nThis, coupled with greater\nmulti-campus promotion,\ntends to lead to a stronger\nfield of candidates and a\ngreater appreciation for\nthe role of Reps to the\noverall student experience\nat Imperial. The result is\ngreater investment in the\nelection outcomes, stronger student campaigns, and\nultimately higher turnout.\nBetter segmenting of our\ncommunications is also\nkey.\u201d\nRecord Turnout at Autumn Elections\nThe elections this year topped the charts in terms of turnout for Autumn, cresting 34% - Felix breaks down the\nstats and speaks to the Elections team\n\u201cThe Faculty\nof Engineering\nblew the\ncompetition\naway with a\nwhopping\n40.0%\nturnout\u201d\ntheir counterparts with\nresults above the overall\naverage of 34.31% \u2013 with\nthe lowest faculty being\nthe \u201cIC\u201d faculty representing students outside\nof the four that encompass\nmost courses, reaching\nonly 19.6%.\nScience, however, took\nrevenge and won out with\nregards to Council Rep\nturnouts, with 24.54%\n\u201cCoupled\nwith greater\nmulti-campus\npromotion,\nw got a\nstronger field\nof candidates\nand a greater\nappreciation\nof Reps'\ncontribution\"\nFelix is recruiting!\n\n"

Traditionally,\nthe supply currency can\nbe controlled by a central\nbank or the government,\nhowever this is not the\ncase with cryptocurren-cies. Within this system,\nWhat are cryptocurrencies and what is happening in\nidentity of its users.\nThis results in dif\ufb01culty tracking transactions\ncompared to traditional\nbanks where transactions\ncan easily be tracked.\nWith Blockchain, transactions can be performed\nwith minimal fees using\nprivate and public keys\nas opposed to steeper fees\noften charged by traditional \ufb01nancial institutions.\nIn addition, Blockchain\nmakes cryptocurrencies\nvirtually impossible to\nmanipulate as transactional data would require\naltering the data of the\nprevious block, requiring\nthe support of multiple\nusers.\nTherefore, cryptocur-rencies are considered to\nbe decentralised, meaning\nthere is no central bank,\nauthority or institution\ntasked with regulating the\ncurrency and verifying\nthe transactions. The\ndif\ufb01culty in tracking\ntransactions with crypto-currencies have resulted\nin it being widely used in\nonline black markets or\nother nefarious activities,\nmost notably through\nSilk Road which was an\nonline market used for\nadopt blockchain-based\ncryptocurrencies and\nplans to develop its own\ndigital renminbi (RMB).\nThis comes as no\nsurprise since mobile\npayments are widely used\nand accepted in China\nwhere both Alipay and\nTencent are widely used.\nThis system makes use\nof a unique QR code to\ncarry out transactions.\nHowever, in many\nWestern countries, the use\nof physical money is still\nthe standard. In China,\nthere is an estimated 45%\nof the population using\nmobile payments however\nin the UK, France and\nGermany this is only\n16.9% , 13.7% and 11%\nrespectively. It is clear that\nother countries are at different stages of accepting\nthe use of technology as a\nsafe and viable platform\nto make purchases, let\nalone adopting decentral-ised cryptocurrencies. In\nrecent years, a US-based\nstart-up called Flexa\ncreated a payment app\nwhich made it easier for\nconsumers and sellers\nto trade using crypto-currencies including\nBitcoin, Ethereum and\nthe Gemini dollar. This\nwas expected to serve up\nto 30,000 stores including\nretailers apprehensive to\nmake a move to crypto-currencies.\nIn the news\nOn the 18th of June\n2019, Facebook publicly\nannounced that they\nare working on Libra, a\ncryptocurrency, with 28\npartnering companies.\nFacebook launched this\nproject to produce a global\ncryptocurrency payment\nsystem which was safe,\nreliable and easy to use.\nBut growing concerns\nregarding Facebook\u2019s\nrecent scandals regarding\nselling drugs. Global governments have responded\ndifferently to cryptocur-rencies; for example in\nthe West, many leaders\nin governments and the\n\ufb01nance sector have criticized its use. This includes\nJohn Bogle, founder of\nasset-management \ufb01rm\nVanguard Group, who\nwarned investors to \u201cavoid\nBitcoin like the plaque\u2019\u2019.\nFamed investor Warren\nBuffet has described\nBitcoin as \u201cprobably\nrat poison squared\u201d and\na \u201cdelusion\u201d.

These people use\nCambridge Analytica and\nthe way in which they\nhandle users\u2019 data has led\nto extreme push back by\nregulators and authority\n\ufb01gures. Amid ongoing\nscrutiny, a quarter of partnering companies have\nwalked out on the project.\nNotably, PayPal left the\npartnership on the 4th of\nOctober and this triggered\nseveral companies to\nleave the partnership the\nfollowing week. This begs\nthe question; will we now\never accept cryptocurren-cies?\ntheir computers to help\nverify and timestamp\ntransactions hence adding\nthem to a record in accordance with a particular\ntimestamping scheme. In\nexchange, these miners\nearn fees in a form of\ncryptocurrencies and at\nthe same time they bear\nthe costs of the machines,\ncooling systems and\nelectricity.\nConsequently, this\nforms a blockchain, which\nis a continuously growing\nlist of records called\n\u201cblocks\u201d that are linked\nand secured using cryp-tography. For example,\nBitcoin uses SHA-256\nto link its blocks, a cryptographic hash function\nfor their proof-of-work\nscheme.Namecoinutilises\na domain name system,\nwhile Litecoin was the\n\ufb01rst to use a script as its\nhash function which acts\nas a password-based key\nderivation function. Each\nblock usually has a hash\npointer which connects to\nthe previous block which\nalso has a timestamp and\ntransaction data. Therefore, these peer-to-peer\nnetwork transactions are\nrecorded permanently\nand do not disclose the\nStarbucks, Whole Foods\nand Nordstrom.

The\nreform, although a step\nin the right direction for\nmany, lacked the impact\nthat many Chileans were\nhoping for and economic\ninequality has been a\npersistent problem.

But while\nthe difficult path that\nHector was on may well\nhave led him to the same\nkind of sorry existence\nthat his on-screen counterpart lived through, it\nwas thanks to Denis Sulta\nthat Hector saw the light.\nHailing from an artistic\ncocoon, Hector first\nwanted to become a freestyle skier. It was through\ndropping out of university\nand getting a job at a\nGlaswegian record store\nthat he fell in love with\ndisco.

A flip of the switch.\nThe young Barbour had\nbeen struggling with\ntrying to establish himself\nin the music business and\nfelt a void around him\nfollowing his departure\nfrom university.

When, eventually, he\ngot better, he decided to\nturn it all around quite literally \u2013 and from his then\ncreative moniker Atlus,\nSulta was born.\nThe rambunctious\nblondie vibing with every\nsingle stomp, jump, and\nfist-pump in the audience\nin front of him can be a\nlesson to us all. After all,\nit was a friend\u2019s simple\nact of kindness which was\nthe catalyst for Denis\u2019\nturnaround. It unlocked\nnot only a creative force\nwhich is carrying the Scot\nto the top of modern house\nmusic, but also added a\npositive entry to the list\nof musical alter egos exploring the manifestation\nof the self as a projection\nfor the audience.

It was an\nintimate session. We sat,\nuncomfortable, still, and\ncompletely silent until the\nmusic had been played.\nGhosteen appears\njust four years after the\ntragic death of Nick\nCave\u2019s son Arthur and\nthree years since the\nrelease of Skeleton Tree,\nan album written primarily before but delivered\nafter his death. Where\nSkeleton Tree was a bleak,\ndark, immediate reaction\nto a life-shaking tragedy,\nGhosteen is a frank exploration of a grief that\nebbs and flows, revealing\nmoments of comfort, and\nit is riddled with fantasy\nand wonder. Nick Cave\u2019s\nuncharacteristic falsetto\nrings hauntingly out,\ntrembling but strong, over\nthe analogue synthesizers.\nThe album is not so much a\ndemonstration of his own\nemotions, but an attempt\nto share them.

This\nconnection is a feat he has\nbeen attempting over the\npast year in his frank and\nopen Red Hand Files.\nIn one answer, he\ndescribed finding his\nwonder and natural curiosity again following\nhis son\u2019s death, and this\ncomes across clearly in\nGhosteen.

    "content": "Translations \u2013 Mythical Ireland speaks the Common\nTongue\nNothing is lost, but is easy to lose yourself, in this fierce production of a play that looks at the value of a language.\nD\nirector Ian\nRickson\u2019s new\nproduction of\nBrian Fiel\u2019s\nplay Translations is\nstaging at The National\nTheatre. Set in an 1833\nhedge school in Baile\nBeag (English: Ballybeg),\nan Irish speaking community in County Donegal,\nthe play explores the\nlingual boundaries that\ndivide us and define us.\nThe smoky, comforting\nsmell of burning wood\ngreets us \u2013 a sign of what\nis to come. A muddy,\nearthen ground sprawls\nacross a misty stage, at\nand Neil Austin to create\na convincing atmosphere.\nA girl (Liad\u00e1n Dunlea) is\ntrying to speak the simple\nIrish sentence: \u201cMy\nname is Sarah\u201d. This is\na phrase that we all take\nfor granted, but for Sarah\nthis sentence holds the\nkey to unlocking one of\nthe most valuable things\nin life: a connection to her\nkin. According to one of\nthe hedge schoolteacher\u2019s\nsons Manus (Seamus\nO\u2019Hara) - it holds the key\nto sharing all the secrets\nthat have thus far been\ninaccessible in the lonely\nworld that is her own\nmind.\nTranslations revolves\naround the story of\nthe Ordnance Survey\nmapping out Ireland in\n1824. Lieutenant George\nYolland (Jack Bardoe) is\nan orthographer on the\nmission who has fallen\nin love with Ireland. The\nSurvey documents place\nnames with Owen (Fra\nFee), a native, helping\nGeorge \u2013 an English\noutsider who is keen to\nlearn the language. The\ntwo consider the sound,\netymology, and of course\nhistory behind a name.\nFiel\u2019s play makes it\napparent that in Anglicising the place names\nthe essence of the places\nis lost in translation. The\nhistory of the people is\nembodied in the language\nthat they speak and the\nnames that they have\nchosen. Language forms a\nchannel to the past in the\nsame way that it forms a\nbarrier between cultures\nin the present. The mountains and sea that separate\nEngland and Ireland are\nmirrored in the differences\nin language: the \u2018contours\u2019\nof the cultural map.\nCiar\u00e1n Hinds gives a\nvery compelling perfor\u201cTranslations\nrevolves\naround the\nstory of the\nOrdnance\nSurvey\nmapping out\nIreland in\n1824\u201d\nmance as the passionate,\nyet often red-faced,\nschoolmaster Hugh who\nfeeds his flock a diet of\nLatin, Greek and Arithmetic, but notably no\nEnglish. In his view, it is\na \u201cplebeian\u201d language and\npoets like Wordsworth\nwho choose such a\nbase tongue to express\nthemselves are simply\nnobodies. On this point,\none of the few things\nthat could be criticised is\nthe littering of Latin and\nancient Greek throughout\nthe script, that could be\nconfusing for some due\nto the pace. However, the\nnudge-nudge wink-wink\nlusting after the fiery-eyed\ngoddess Athene described\nin the verses of Jimmy\nJack Cassie (Dermot\nCrowley) was hilarious.\nFra Fee as Owen gives\nan outstanding portrayal\nof a young man with good\nintentions who comes to\nterms with the true nature\nof his work translating\nIrish place names into\nEnglish. In particular, the\nscenes with his brother\nManus have tense,\npalpable undercurrents.\nHis loyalty gradually\ngrows and his discomfort\nwith the task he is performing comes to a head\nas he passionately narrates\nthe story behind a place\nwhose name is simply a\nbutchered Irish version of\n\u2018Crossroads\u2019, but whose\nhistory involves a strange\nstory about a man with\nwarts and a well - something untranslatable.\nThere is also a darker\nand more cynical side to\nthe play. When Captain\nLancey (Rufus Wright),\nan unforgiving English\nredcoat, forces the community to use the Anglicised place names, the\ncast effectively portray\nthe image of a broken\npeople. Notably, Sarah,\nwho regresses back into\nher repressed, silent state.\nDunlea\u2019s portrayal of\nthe almost mute girl is a\nstellar demonstration of a\nperformance that touches\nus simply through body\nlanguage and expression.\nLanguage can inspire\nus to be who we are, but\nas the play and the wonderful cast and team so\naptly portray, it can also be\nused as a tool to oppress\nothers and take away their\nidentity. Indeed, director\nRickson realises this is\nnot just a historical issue,\nand makes it known in\nstark fashion that history\nmay be repeating itself\nin a dramatic and novel\nclimax that leaves us\nthinking about oppression\nin modern society. All in\nall, a worthy play to see if\nyou wish to see a quality\ncast and team put on an\nemotional production that\nwill leave you thinking\nmuch more deeply about\nthe role of language in\nshaping the past and the\npresent.\nA family united: Seamus O\u2019Hara, Ciar\u00e1n Hinds and Fra Free.

However, these\ncompanies are heavily\nfocused on pushing\nresearch that make these\nsystems more capable for\nhuman interaction.\nComing to home auto-mation, virtual assistants\nare integrated into smart-home speakers that act\nas central hubs for other\ninternet-connected, smart-home devices such as\nlightbulbs, power sockets,\nthermostats, security\ncameras, or door locks.\nThese devices are aimed\nat easing the \u2018pressure\u2019\non managing our daily\nlifestyle; in other words,\nthey automate tasks and\nmake living convenient.\nBasically, all devices connected to a central hub can\nbe either controlled with\nyour voice or through a\nconnected smartphone.\nMost smart-speakers,\nexcept Apple\u2019s HomePod\nand the Sonos One, focus\nless on audio quality.\nRather, their main\npurpose is to serve as a\n\u2018voice box\u2019 of sorts for\nthe virtual assistants they\nhouse.

Shortcuts are\ndrag-and-drop scripts that\nhave a logical flow similar\nto that of a flowchart and\nalmost act as a programming language with the\ncapability to manipulate\ndata from different apps\nto automate tasks.

You\nwant some fun. You round\nup your friends and dance\nthe stress away while\nscreaming Beyonc\u00e9 lyrics\nat the top of your lungs,\nhaving the time of your\nlife as a student in one\nof the best cities in the\nworld. That lasts like 10\nminutes. Then someone\ngets kicked out, someone\nelse disappears and ends\nup in the other side of\nLondon all while you are\nmaking bad decision on\nthe dance floor with your\nex. Only one thing can fix\na night like this. Food.\nMcDonalds is the place\nof choice for students\nwhen it comes to that.\nYou know what you are\nin for and they have many\nlocations that are open\nlate at night. Then there\nare the kebab and chicken\nshops conveniently placed\nclose to the club with reasonable yet slightly higher\nprices than they should\nbe. They haven\u2019t done\nus wrong yet. And yet, I\nstill I think we deserve\nmore. We deserve space\nand comfort while we eat\nas much food as we can\nget our hands on. That\u2019s\nwhere VQ comes in. They\nare a chain of 24 hours\nrestaurants (with a few\npesky outliers) that are\nwilling to accommodate\nthe tired and tipsy that\nstumble in through the\nnight with never ending\nbreakfast. We gave them\na visit sober to see if they\ndeserve to see us at our\nworst.\nTo start, we had their\nchicken and waffles.\nAn American southern\nclassic with enough\ngrease and sugar to lull\nany drunk to serenity. It\ncame as 3 boneless fried\nchicken pieces on top of 1\nwaffle which was a weird\nratio. The chickens could\nbarely fit and it would\nhave plated much better\nto have a second waffle.\nNevertheless, the taste did\nnot disappoint. I found\nthat the breading was\nwell seasoned and paired\nperfectly with the intense\nsweetness of the waffle.\nHaving the fillets dipped\nin their maple syrup was\na religious experience.\nIt\u2019s a shame that that this\nisn\u2019t part of their breakfast\nmenu because this would\ndefinitely get me going in\nthe morning.\nWe still needed to try\n\u201cHaving the\nfillets dipped\nin their maple\nsyrup was\na religious\nexperience\u201d\nout another comfort food\nfor eating the humiliation\nof the night away, so we\ngot the apple crumble.\nThis was another sugary\ntreat and with some\ncustard in a bowl to the\nside. The custard was\nwithout a doubt the\nhighlight of the dish with\nthe smooth, golden liquid\nwarmed us up from the\ninside out. The size of\nthe bowls made it hard\nto incorporate the two\ntreats with each other \u2013 a\nproblem that only be\nheightened in a drunken\nstate \u2013 but that\u2019s what you\nhave the sober friend for.\nOutside of their comfort\nfood we needed to also\ntrial the establishment as\nan actual restaurant. Their\nsmoked salmon tagliatelle looked and smelled\namazing, with enough\nsalmon to ease the wound\nto our bank accounts, but\nthere just wasn\u2019t enough\ncream sauce. Due to this,\nthe whole thing just ended\nup being dry even though\nthe taste did, otherwise,\ndeliver.\nNow I\u2019m not going to\nlie to you. Some of the\nprices had our student\nwallets shaking in their\noverdrafts. But that\u2019s why\nthis place is different. It\u2019s\nnot for when you bought\none too many rounds at\nthe bar and are worried\nabout how you are going\nto afford the uber home let\nalone your post-club meal.\nIt\u2019s for when you need to\nbad decisions, you can\nfeel above it too.\nFrom Aldgate to\nBloomsbury to Clapham,\nthey have restaurant all\nover London, so you are\nbound to pass one on your\nway back home. There\nis even one in Fulham\n(where they started out)\nthat is open 24 hours and\nhas a 24-hour alcohol\nlicence if you want to\nkeep the party going for\nsome inane reason. Their\nbreakfast menu is always\navailable so you can have\nyour full English at 4 am\nwhile wondering how you\nended up in this situation\nwith some semblance of a\nfunctionality surrounding\nyou.\nVQ\u2019s apple crumble, with a golden custard as the highlight of the dish // Zahra Abiola\n\u201cVQ is not\nfor when you\nbought one\ntoo many\nrounds - it\u2019s to\nbe waited on\nafter running\nafter your\nfriends all\nnight\u201d\u201d\nbe waited on after having\nto run after your crazy\nfriends all night. Like they\nsay, you are what you eat.\nSo maybe \u2013 just maybe\n\u2013 if you eat above your\nactual mood of regret and\nEnough salmon to sate the appetite, but lacking in the crucial sauce! // Zahra Abiola\n\n"

Writing\nin the dark of night while\nsomeone left the Felix\ncloset unlocked, this\nLondon-dwelling resident\ncan finally reveal it to you.\nHave you been salivating\nover your next piece of\nchocolate, only to be\ndeterred by high prices\nand substandard chocolate\ncoins? Look no further,\nfor I have the secret to\nyour salvation.\nFor the next two\nweekends, the influx of\nthe nasty mini handout\nbars will abate, and prices\nof normal bars will come\ndown. NOW is the time\nto buy. Halloween is over;\nthere are no frantic parents\nlooking for their child\u2019s\nnext sugar high. The\nhorrific price gauging we\nhave been experiencing\nfor the last month is going\nto see a \u201cthrowback\u201d, if\nyou will, to summertime\nprices for a limited time\n\u2013 just until about mid\nNovember. Why, you\nask? Well, I have 5 years\nof experience shopping\nthrough Asda, Lidl and\nTesco shelves as a teen\nlooking for their next\n\u201cThe\nsupermarket\npowers come\ntogether for 3\nmonths to gain\nas much profit\nas possible\u201d\nsugar hit. That means I can\ntell you mid-November is\nwhen the money-grab-bing, holiday-profiteering\nsupermarkets start advertising Advent calendars\n(just more overpriced\nchocolate that has\nprobably melted twice\nbefore reaching shelves).\nAfter the Advent calendars come the price hikes\nin fancy chocolate. Now,\nas people visit family over\nthe years\u2019 end, they tend\nto be forced into buying\nholiday packs, specially\ndesigned to hold as little\nchocolate as possible\nwhile still advertising\nthe holiday. It appears\nextracting money for\noverpriced chocolate is\nnot exactly profitable (I\u2019m\nnot buying 273 grams of\nchocolate for \u00a37!), so supermarkets then take the\ninitiative to hike up prices\nfor ordinary, normal\nchocolate during this\nseason. These hiked up\nprices remain throughout\nthe Christmas month and\nthrough to January for the\noffice New Year Parties.\nThere is no drop in prices\ndespite the general resolutions of \u201cgetting healthy\u201d\nand \u201cnot eat as much\nchocolate\u201d, because we\nall know that Valentines\u2019\nDay is just \u2018round the\ncorner.

    "content": "ISSUE 1732\nNEWS\nFELIX\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n3\nNEWS\nHenry Alman\nEditor-in-Chief\nT\nhe strikes, organised by the\nUnited Voices\nof the World\n(UVW) trade union,\ntook place on Monday\n28th, Tuesday 29th, and\nThursday 31st October,\nwith an estimated 200\nstaff joining at some\npoint over the three\ndays. There are plans\nfor further strike action\nover the coming weeks,\nfor a total of fifteen days\nthroughout November\nand December \u2013 critical\nperiods for the hospital\u2019s operation.\nThe actions were\ncoordinated with strikes\nfrom workers at other\nLondon institutions, such\nas the Ministry of Justice,\nLondon\u2019s Royal Parks,\nthe headquarters of ITV\nand Channel 4, and the\nUniversities of Greenwich and East London as\nwell as St. George\u2019s University. This culminated\non Thursday with a joint\nmarch between each loca-tion, ending at St. Mary\u2019s.\nImperial students have\nbeen seen attending and\nsupporting the strikes\nduring the week, in a sign\nof solidarity.\nIn 2017, UVW-organised action saw LSE\nrescind its former contract\nwith Noonan, another outsourcing firm, and bring\ntheir outsourced cleaners\nin-house. This kickstart-ed a miniature wave of\nsimilar commitments\nfrom other universities,\nparticularly in London \u2013\nbut it doesn\u2019t compare to\nthe overwhelming general\ntrend towards outsourc-ing, with an almost 70%\nrise in university spending\non outsourced workers\nbetween 2010 and 2017.\nImperial College itself\nis still contracted with\nNoonan, though a College\nspokesperson stated that\nthey are paid a living\nwage. This is in direct\ncontrast with the workers\nat St. Mary\u2019s under the\nImperial College NHS\nTrust, which is a separate\nentity to the College but\nhas close links via academic research \u2013 and via\nprovision of both teaching\nand clinical experience\nfor medics.\nThe complaints levied\nat the Trust by the striking\nworkers are multiple, but a\nkey one is pay. Currently,\nmany are paid minimum\nwage by Sodexo \u2013 just\n\u00a38.21 an hour \u2013 which is\nsignificantly lower than\nthey would be paid if they\nwere in-house with the\nNHS in the same roles.\nIndeed, the lowest point\non the NHS pay scale is\n\u00a39.03 an hour. UVW says\nthat this creates a \u201ctwo-tier\nsystem\u201d between in-house\nand outsourced workers.\nPractical considerations\nof surviving in London on\nlow wages aside, several\nsaid that they felt disrespected and undervalued:\n\u201cit just feels like we\u2019re\nconsidered \u2018below\u2019 the\npay scale \u2013 we aren\u2019t\neven worth being paid the\nminimum they would pay\nanyone.\u201d\nThere are further\nissues with sick pay. The\nSodexo-employed staff\nare only given Statutory\nsick pay \u2013 in other words,\nonly after being absent\nfor three unpaid days, and\nthen only up to \u00a394.25\nper week. Combined\nwith the low wage, this\nhas forced workers to\ncontinue despite illness\n\u2013 and despite the fact\nthat they\u2019re working in a\nhospital, in which many\npatients are susceptible to\ninfection.\nAdditionally, many\nworkers claim they have\nnot been properly vaccinated \u2013 which is one\nof their key demands.\nSpeaking to those at the\nstrike, this latter point\nwas raised often \u2013 there\nfor factors like wages and\nsick pay based on how\nmany employees were\nneeded and the value of\nthe contract. He further\nsaid that the Trust likely\ndecided to hire outsourced\n(and mostly migrant)\nworkers instead of bringing them in-house as a\nmoney-saving bid.\nThis is despite the fact\nthat a report produced by\nSt. George\u2019s University in\nNovember 2016, after a\nprevious UVW in-housing\nbid, showed that outsourcing does not actually save\nmoney total in the end. In\nfact, bringing \u2018soft facilities management\u2019 workers\nin-house at St. George\u2019s\nwould have saved up to\n\u00a3200,000 a year. Despite\nthis, they still outsource\n\u2013 and have staff who\nparticipated in the strikes\nthis week.\nThe St. Mary\u2019s strikes\nare scheduled to continue\non the 11th to 13th and\n25th to 28th of November,\nfollowed by the 9th to\n13th of December.\nThe strikers banding together outside St. Mary's // UVW\nImprial College NHS Trust Staff Strike\nwas a genuine feeling of\ndedication to their work,\nand chagrin at the idea\nof having to endanger the\npatients they work for in\norder to survive them-selves.\nOne striking cleaner\nsaid, \u201cI work 55 hours\na week just to cover my\nrent. St. Mary\u2019s is my\nhome, I spend more time\nhere than in my house. Yet\nI am treated like a dog and\nmade to feel like dirt.\u201d\nThere is a fundamental\nproblem with morale.\nWorking in a hospital is\nalways a tough job, especially in oft-overlooked\nroles such as cleaning\nor catering. A sense of\ninternal community is\nimportant for surviving\nthe trials and tribulations.\nHowever, the outsourced\nstaff are not included in\nthat \u2013 they are isolated and\nalienated from in-house\nworkers, both in terms of\npay, but also in other more\ndirect ways.\nThey are, for example,\nbarred from using the\nsame canteens and\nstaffrooms. They also\nclaim that they are only\nprovided a mixed-gender,\nmice-infested changing\nroom in the basement,\nand are often only given\none or two uniforms by\nSodexo \u2013 meaning they\nare forced to come to work\nin unwashed clothes.\nSodexo, the firm to\nwhich the Trust has outsourced these positions,\nis a multinational corporation with a billion-euro\nprofit each year; the lack\nof provisions is not due to\ninability. It often amounts\nto little more than mistreatment of migrant\nworkers \u2013 two staff who\nspoke to Felix claim they\nwere told to \u201cgo home\u201d, as\nin to their own countries,\nwhen bringing concerns\nto Sodexo.\nThe minutes of the\nTrust\u2019s latest Trust Board\nmeeting on the 25th of\nSeptember \u2013 which was\nafter the strike was announced \u2013 do not mention\nthe action being taken, or\nSodexo staff in a related\ncontext, implying it was\nnot discussed. In a press\nrelease after the strike had\nbegun, they revealed that\nthey have firmly committed to ensuring their staff\nreceive the London Living\nWage, and will be renegotiating a new outsourcing\ncontract to begin in April\nnext year.\nAdditionally, the Trust\nitself also published a\nletter addressed to the\nCEO of Sodexo on Thursday 31st, which sought to\nensure issues would be\nresolved, and stated:\n\u201cAll of the staff who\nwork in our hospitals,\nincluding all Sodexo\nemployees, are part of\none team and should be\ntreated as such, but you\nhave the primary responsibility as their employer\nto ensure their welfare\nand to respond to their\nconcerns.\u201d\nPetros, one of the\nkey organisers of the St.\nMary\u2019s strike, takes a different stance, and said that\nthe Trust needs to accept\nresponsibility along with\nSodexo. The outsourcing\ncontract signed between\nthe two would, he claims,\nhave specified parameters\n\n"

    "content": "Binge of the Week: Barry (Seasons 1 and 2)\nBloody BLOODY brilliant\nD\nespite taking\nthe States by\nstorm, Barry\nhas been a\npretty low-key show on\nthis side of the pond.\nWith 30 Emmy nomi-nations, the HBO show\ntells the story of Barry\n(Bill Hader), a hitman\nwho follows his target\nto an acting class in Los\nAngeles, and, by some\nmiracle of fate, decides to\npursue acting.\nAn experience\nBarry intertwines two\ncompletely different\nworlds beautifully, with\nboth developing so\nsmoothly and intricately.\nThe influence of each one\non the other is clear. They\ncomplicate each other;\nthey complement each\nother. These two worlds,\none of a brutal war-veter-an-turned-hitman, Barry\nBerkman, and one of the\nstruggling actor, Barry\nBlock, really sound like\ntwo different shows at\nface value, but the show\nuses this to its advantage,\nconstantly comparing\nand contrasting the two\nworlds, letting them\ncollide, and most impor-tantly, letting Barry make\nmistakes that cause his\npast to constantly catch up\nwith him, no matter how\nhard he tries to run away.\nIt\u2019s very out there, but\nthis approach allows it to\ncover a lot of ground.\nThe show is hilarious\nat times, but it would be\na disservice to call it a\ncomedy per se. It is the\njourney of a man struggling to make himself get\nbetter against all odds.\nDespite the absurdity,\nthe progression of events\nis natural. Although\nshocking at times, the\nshow makes sure that no\nplot point is simply there\nto act as a twist and throw\nthe audience off, even\nthough they do just that\nmore than occasionally.\nThe show takes you from\nlaughing out loud to\ngasping for air within the\nnext scene.\nThe acting\nThe acting and charac-terisations are very strong\nacross the board, although\nthere\u2019s a few people who\ngo above and beyond.\n\u201cHenryWinkler\nplays the\nrole of failed-actor-turned-acting-coach,\nproviding a lot\nof comic relief\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to\nput Barry into\na box\u201d\nHenry Winkler plays the\nrole of the failed-actor-turned-acting-coach, providing a lot of comic relief.\nA lot of what he says, and\nperhaps more importantly,\nthe way he says them are\nso exceptionally funny,\nyet I have no doubts that\nsuch people really do exist\nin Hollywood. However,\nwhere Winkler deserves\nthe most credit is in the\nscenes where his character shows emotions. This\nis rare, but beautiful as\nmany rare things are.\nAnthony Carrigan\nembodies the upbeat\nChechen gangster NoHo\nHank so perfectly that\nthe audience can\u2019t help\nbut sympathise with\nhim. Sarah Goldberg\npulls off Sally, the girl-next-door who Barry is\ndeeply infatuated with\nexceptionally well. Sally\nis so grossly unlikeable,\nwhich is exactly what\nthe show needs her to be\nto work. Goldberg has a\nstrong monologue late\ninto season 2 that not only\nsums her character up\nperfectly but also really\nshows off her acting\nchops.\nHowever, the real MVP\nof the show is none other\nthan Bill Hader, who\u2019s\nco-created, executive\nproduced, starred in,\nco-directed and co-writ-ten the show. Hader has a\nway of pulling Barry off,\ndisplaying the character\u2019s\ninternal turmoil with\nevery inch of his being. It\nis a strong performance,\nyet it is his wonderful attention to detail, subtlety\nand precision as a writer\nand a director that makes\nthe show.\nSeason 1 vs Season 2\nThe show is gripping\nfrom the get-go.\nHowever, I think it would\nbe accurate to say that\nthe majority of the first\nseason is spent setting\nup the show. It is wildly\nentertaining, but it is only\na hint of what\u2019s to come in\nseason 2. Both seasons are\nshort, so I promise you\u2019ll\nget to season 2 in no time\nanyway. So, sit tight and\nenjoy season 1.\nOverall, the second\nseason superior by far, as\nless energy is spent into\nestablishing things and\nmore on building things\nup. We find out more\nabout what makes Barry\nhimself, with flashbacks\nto his military past. We\nget to see what makes\nhim snap, what makes\nhim kill, and what makes\nhim want to stop killing.\nIt is all quite beautifully\nprofound, really.\nThere is a few episodes\nthat rise above the rest\nin season two. ronny/\nlily plays out a lot like a\none-take sequence and is\nso bonkers that I had to\ndo a double-take to make\nsure it wasn\u2019t a dream\nsequence. I\u2019m still not\nquite sure, but maybe\nthat\u2019s the beauty of it.\nThe penultimate episode\nof the second season,\nThe Audition, is, in broad\nterms, everything that\nmakes the show great. The\nseason finale, berkman >\nblock s so incredibly bleak\nand honest and real that it\nwas refreshing. The acting\nin this episode alone by\nHader and Winkler is so\nextraordinary and special.\nOverall, the second season\nfinale is probably one of\nmy favourite TV episodes\nof the year.\nShould you watch it?\nA big yes. It\u2019s difficult\nto put Barry into a box,\nbut that only means that\nregardless of what genre\ntends to rock your boat,\nthere is surely something\nin Barry that would tickle\nyour fancy. Overall, Barry\nis brutal, it\u2019s grimy, it\u2019s\nsmart, and it\u2019s provoca-tive. It\u2019s honestly great.\nThe show has been\nrenewed for season 3,\nwhich is expected to air\nstarting March 2020.\nBarry , Season 1// Amazon\nISSUE 1732\nFELIX\nTELEVISION tv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n27\nTELEVISION\nOzbil Ege Dumenci\nTelevision Editor\nCreator: Alec Berg, Bill\nHader Starring: Bill Hader,\nHenry Winkler, Anthony\nCarrigan, Sarah Goldberg\nSEASON 1\nSEASON 2\n\n"

It\u2019s been waves\nof different things. Over\nsummer, at the begin-ning, there was a lot of\nsettling in, and then there\nwas a wave of college\nmeetings, now it\u2019s a wave\nof dealing with volunteers\n\u2013 elections, training, and\nso on. It\u2019s been nice in\nmy role to get to see a\nbig cross-section of the\nCollege \u2013 it clues you\nin to services you didn\u2019t\neven know existed, and\nlearn a lot more about\nhow everything works.\nFelix: You\u2019re someone who was quite\ninvolved with the\nUnion as a rep and\nin the RCSU before\nentering this role\n\u2013 but were still una-ware. Do you think\nthere needs to be\nmore communication\nabout how things\nwork behind the\nscenes?\nIt\u2019s not necessarily crucial\nfor students to know the\nbehind the scenes stuff\n\u2013 it\u2019s like the \u2018swan on\nwater\u2019 analogy. Students\nshould see the majestic\nswan gliding by, while\nbeneath the surface\nthere\u2019s a lot of thrashing\nto keep it all working! I\u2019d\nlike to think that students\nwho need certain services do find out about\nthem \u2013 for example, I\nnever needed the Centre\nfor Academic English so\ndidn\u2019t know about it for\na long time, but I\u2019d hope\na student who did would\nfind it.\nCollege has been doing\nstuff in this direction \u2013\nthey just launched the\nnew student support zone\non the website, which\nrestructures how information about services is presented to students. Instead\nof being a list of services,\nit focuses on what areas\na student might struggle\nin, and then directs them\nto the right information.\nThe goal is for students to\nfeel like there is an \u2018air\u2019\nor atmosphere of support,\nwhich is what I think is\noften lacking.\nFelix: One thing I\nhear a lot of is a new\nfocus on\u201cstudent\nexperience\u201dand\n\u201cholistic wellbeing\u201d\nand such \u2013 including\nthe idea of a\u2018wellbeing hub\u2019being built.\nThe student support\nzone seems to be in\nthat trend of central-ising issues students\nmight have so they\ncan more easily find\ninformation. What\nare your thoughts?\nIt\u2019s potentially beneficial.\nI can definitely see the\nvalue of knowing for\ncertain that a space for\nyour wellbeing exists,\nand it might help add to\nthat air of support. If it\nwas ever going to happen\nit would be a very long-term, high-level, strategic\nproject!\nI don\u2019t know if this is\nthe best way to use that\namount of resources,\nthough \u2013 particularly\nspace-wise given how\ncramped things are at the\nSouth Ken campus \u2013 and\nI worry about College\ncommitting to such a big\nproject and maybe then\nputting off doing other important things. One thing\nto remember is that over\nthe next couple of decades\nit seems the College will\nbe moving to a multi-cam-pus style. Even now only\na half to a third of students\nare regularly on the South\nKensington campus, and\nmany more are only part-time for example \u2013 so such\nShervin Sabeghi, the Deputy President (Welfare) // ICU\n\n"

This culture\nis still held amongst many\nof the Chinese, mainland\nor overseas. Therefore\nthe chaos in Hong Kong\ngarners no significant\nChinese sympathy.\nAdditionally, I do\nacknowledge that Hong\nKong\u2019s citizens are extremely dissatisfied with\nthe local government.\nHowever, it has more to\ndo with its economy and\nrising property prices/\nliving costs which has\nturned much of the youth\ndesperate and angry for\nchange. However, this\nanger is misdirected. The\ntycoons, who jettisoned\nHK\u2019s former Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa\u2019s\nplan to build 85,000\naffordable homes a year.\nbelieving that this scheme\nwould send property\nprices plummeting, public\nopinion turned against him\nand forced him to abandon\nhis plan. Thus, the marked\nincrease in property\nprices, which have risen\n300% since 2003. Hong\nKong\u2019s citizens should\nturn their wrath towards\nthe city\u2019s elite, instead of\nthe government.\nAdditionally, Chinese\nhistory also shapes our\nworldview. A hundred\nyears of humiliation and\ndecades of bullying by\nthe west (the bombing\nof the Chinese embassy\nin Belgrade, the full\nembargo led by America\nand constant demonisa-tion of the Chinese gov-ernment, despite it lifting\n700 million people out of\npoverty within a century)\nhave led to a very patriotic\npopulation that thinks\nitself unfairly targeted\nby the same West who\nprofited as much from\ncheap prices as China\nfrom technology gains.\nIn the end, Hong Kong\nis China. The very first\nArticle of the Basic Law\nstates so. Anyone who is\nfamiliar with the Basic\nLaw and its complexities\ncan see that Hong Kong\nis an indivisible part\nof China. Hong Kong\ncitizens, in my opinion,\nshould be proud of their\nheritage, not try to identify themselves as distinct\nfrom Chinese people.\nThat is how the world\nviews us. To preserve\nHong Kong\u2019s autonomy,\nthe best thing to do would\nbe to prove that the \u20181\nCountry, 2 Systems\u2019 principle is essential for the\ncity\u2019s prosperity, instead\nof being a recipe for\ndisaster. The smart thing\nwould be to convince the\nChinese government that\nHong Kong should be\nkept as a world-class tax\nhaven (with little political\ncost). Showing that the\nextradition bill would adversely affect this would\nallow for the Basic Law to\nbe extended beyond 2047.\nThat would be a victory\nfor most Hong Kong\ncitizens.\nSources provided by\nthe writer for this article\nare available upon\nrequest.\nFelix welcomes all\nstudent opinions on\nthis or any other issue.\nIf you want your voice\nheard, whether to agree\nor disagree, contact\nthe Comment editors at\ncomment.felix@imperial.\nac.uk\nThe Hong Kong Protests // Flickr: Studio Incendo\nFELIX ISSUE 1732\nFelix is recruiting!\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you!We\u2019re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, reporters, computer experts\nand grammar nerds to join our team.
