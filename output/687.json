The Imperial College\nPassing Wind Club is what I am talking about\n\u2014 my first flight in the club's hot air balloon.\nAnyway after having dragged ourselves away\nfrom beds, parties etc at 3am we discover\nthat conditions in Nottinghamshire are not\nsuitable for flying so we'll leave later in the\nmorning. Back to our beds etc.\nWe assemble once again at 8.30am and set off for Blyth in Notts. After a long\nuncomfortable journey in the back of a union\nminibus, shared with a hot-air balloon, we\narrive and pile into comfy padded seats in our\nHQ for the weekend, ie a pub. The local brew\ngoes down well and soon di solves the\nnumbness from our buttocks.\nWhat about the ballooning? The wind is\nstill too strong and we sit and watch the trees\nthrash about outside. There is apos sibi l ty the wind will die down for Sunday so we\nremain hopeful. Not all of Saturday\nafternoon is spent in the pub, an expedition is\nmade to a local forest to look for (tasty)\nedible fungi. It is really amazing the number\nof different species/type of fungi i one can\nfind, as one staggers about, in just a small\npatch of woodland. Some specimens are\nfried up and prove to be quite tasty.\nHaving survived the mushrooms/\ntoadstools(?) back to the ballooning. The\nwhole idea of zooming up to Blyth is to join in\nwith a Pennine Region balloon meet (a balloon meet is where lots of balloons meet).\nAt the AGM and supper we are told\nprospects look good for flying on Sunday.\nThis means waking at 6am on Sunday!\n7am Sunday and suddenly I find myself at\nthe morning briefing. The weather is good so\nwe set off for the launch site. The balloon is\nsoon unpacked, inflated and ready for take-off. Only two new members are present so\nwe are given priority and prepare for our first\nflight (really my third because I am an ex Bath\nUniversity Balloon Club member).\nUp, up and away. We soon reach 2000\nfeet. The view is breathtaking. Apart from\nthe occasional roar of the burner there is a deafening silence. We spend one and half\nhours drifting across the Notts countryside\nover villages, power stations, farms etc.\nEverything looks different in plan view. 'No\nsign of the retrieve van'. Our pilot decides to\ntag along with another balloon for the last\npart of our journey. After a while we find\nourselves directly above the other balloon \u2014\nout comes the camera \u2014 we spiral around\neach other for several miles. Finally the pilot\ndecides it's time we landed and a field is\nchosen. A ditch runs directly across our\npath. The pilot and other passengers use me\na a cushion on landing (landings are not the\nmost comfortable part of ballooning) and the\nground gives us a warm welcome. Now we\nwait for the retrieval van. Another pub lunch.\nThe wind stays around 10 knots for the\nafternoon and we are able to fly again. Off\nthey go, ' OK who's got the van keys?'... 'I dunno'. You've guessed, the keys have flown\naway with one of our club members who shall\nremain nameless (he is our club chairman).\nHow was the balloon retrieved? That is\nanother story.\nJAZZ\nJamming\nsessions\nThe Jazz Club will be holding further\njamming sessions for members every\nMonday from November 19 onwards. The\nfirst session will be for those interested in\nplaying jazz or jazz funk, the following one\nfor rock or blues, and from then on it will\nalternate each week between the two.\nMembers and non-members alike are\nwelcome to come along, bringing their\ninstruments if possible. The evening will start\nat 7.00pm and membership is \u00a31.00.\nPHOTO\nNo colour\nprinting\nIt is with great sadness that the committee\nhave to report the death of the Durst M700\nColour Enlarger which passed away\npeacefully in its sleep sometime last week.\nAlthough its demise was not unexpected (it\nhas had one foot in the grave for the last five\nyears at least) it will come as a shock to those\nmembers who will want to do some colour\nprinting between now and mid-December,\nwhich is the earliest possible time at which it\ncan be replaced. If and when we do get a new\ncolour enlarger members will need to be\nespecially careful with it, 'cos we won't be\nable to get another for at least ten years.\nOn Sunaday (18 Nov) there will be a photos oc trip to the London Butterfly House\nat Syon Park. Anyone who wants to go\nshould turn up at Beit Arch at 10am,( the\ncommittee will be going even if no-one else\nis). Macro equipment is not necessary, but\nyou should bring flashguns, tripods and fast\nfilm, as the light may not be too good. It costs\n\u00a31.50 to get in, (although if ten or more\npeople turn up it's only \u00a31.30) and the bus\nfare is probably about a quid each way. I hope we get more people this time than the\nnumber who signed up for the Bradford trip\n(an integer between zero and two).\nFinally, a message for our Darkroom\nOfficer come to the committee meeting\ntoday or you'll get the sack!\n10 Friday 16 November 1984 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "ELETTERS\nThink again\nMr Snivel\nDear Sir,\nThe lightening wit and devastating\ncynicism of our friend Everard has again\nbeen seen in these columns. It does seem that\nhe is more interested in creating a response to\nfill the letters page than in saying anything\nspecific. Not wishing his efforts last week to\nbe in vain, I would like to take up one point\nwith him.\nIt is all well and good sinking to the depths\n(excuse the pun) of criticising a certain\nrecreational club or any other group in\ncollege that needs exposing. It is another\nthing to slander the name of someone who\ntakes a prominent role in the lives of many in\nCollege calling themselves Christians,\nmeaning one who identifies and lives by the\nteaching of Jesus and even more, proclaims\nhim as did the early disciples as Lord and\nGod.\nIn view of this it came as a surprise to me to\nsee this man who taught and showed the way\nto God, who healed the sick, who condemned\nreligious hypo c racy and was finally prepared\nto face death for that which he believed,\nreferred to as a 'confidence trickster,\nfreeloading food, transport and women'!\nReally, Mr Snivel, please think again.\nYours faithfully\nRoger Preece\nBrown bore\nwrites\nDear Sir,\nI was interested to hear other students\ncomments on my proposals concerning\nstudent loans. For Messrs Hooper and\nWinterton it is easy to pontificate about the\nmerits of grants, cushioned as they are by\nindustrial sponsorships. For many students\nthe financial dependance upon parents is\nboth intolerable and unjustifiable. For their\ninformation, Con Soc is affiliated to the\nFederation of Conservative Students, which\nrepresents some 12,000 students in over 100\neducational esta blis ment s, and it is this body\nwhich is proposing loans as a replacement to\ngrants to the Government.\nPerhaps Mr Atkins has failed to realise that\nhis democratic right to criticise would not\nexist, given that Britain abandoned its\ndefences as he suggest, and under a totalitarian state he would most certainly be a corpse by now.\nI would say however, that the caption to\nhis letter needs some explanation, as its\nrelevance is beyond me. Peter Brooke MP has\nstated that higher education and grants are a pri vele ge and not a right, as Mr Atkins\nsuggest. Implicit therefore, is the need for it\nto be cost-effective.\nI firmly believe that the best system of\nGovernment is no government \u2014\nbure ac racy, inefficiency and socialism are\ngreat evils and must be fought in all their\nguises. I still remain in favour of loans, but\nwelcome all comments.\nGraham Brown\nCon Soc Chairman\nBoolery Woolery\nwrong again\nDear Sir\nIn last week's Boolery Woolery column\nyou criticized ICC ND for trying to make\npolitical capital from Remembrance Day.\nPerhaps you should have been admiring them\nfor taking a leaf out of our glorious leader's book, who last year tried to make political\ncapital by attempting to prevent Dr Owen\nand Mr Steel appearing at one Remembrance\nCeremony at the Cenotaph.\nYours faithfully\nJulian Shulman\nPhysics 3\nDear Sir\nI found some of last week's comments on\nthe selling of white poppies in remembrance\nof war victims confusing.\nI strongly disagree with the banded\nphrases, 'those who gave..' or'who sacrificed\ntheir lives to ensure that future generations..'.\nSurely this is a euphemism for 'those who\nlost..' or 'were sacrificed..'. Speaking as a person who is terrified of the thought of\n'serving one's country' in time of war, I do\nnot comprehend that anyone willingly steps\nin front of a bullet. That bravery, although\nlaudable, is mainly the result of situational\ncircumstances ie irrational action through\nhigh levels of a dre nel in. I prefer hiding\nbehind the skirt of a nuclear deter ent. The fascination many middle-aged persons\nhave with the second world war is abhor ent. It is fuelled either by the mind protecting\nitself by remembering only the good things in\nwar time eg comradeship, or more\ndangerously by the generation, who were\nchildren during the war, feeling they have\nmissed some valuable experience through not\nbeing older. Hence the assured success of\nmost war films.\nWhether one buys a white or red poppy\nseems less relevant than symbolising personal\nremembrance of the futility of previous wars\nand the waste of resources, human and\nphysical.\nYours faithfully\nG Purdom\nChem Eng II\nFELIX Later this month College and Union officials\nwill interview for the post of Union Welfare\nAdvisor.\nWhen this post was created the Advisor\nwas paid by the Union and gave impartial\nadvice on welfare matters such as rent\nrebates, rights as tenants, supplementary\nbenefit, consumer rights, and so on.\nAfter a subsequent rational is ation, the\nCollege began to pay the Advisor who was\nbased in Student Services in Princes Gardens.\nThe Advisor then spent much time\nassisting Student Services in the\nadministration of the Halls of Residence.\nThis is not to detract from the excellent\nwelfare work done by the last Advisor, but\nmerely to point out the dangers of too close as\nlink between Welfare and Student Services,\nwhich is, after all, a part of the College\nadministration.\nThe College and Union should think long\nand hard about the responsibilities of the\nWelfare Advisor. Above all, the person\nappointed must not be seen to be just another\narm of the College administration.\nLetters received suggest that some of you\nthink that the Editor writes and agrees with\neverything in FELIX. I can tell you that if I only published what I believed myself, FELIX would be very\ndifferent; but it would be the newspaper of\nme, not Imperial College Union.\nI shall continue to publish controversial\nmaterial, in the belief that it is only by\ndiscussion that sound ideas will prevail and\nerroneous views will be exposed for what they\nare.\nTo do otherwise would be to be guilty of\nintolerance and tyranny.\nAcknowledgements: Many thanks to Nigel,\nPeter, Ajay, Hugh, Martin, Luke, Rich,\nGrenville, Dave, Jon, Nick, Richard, Patrick,\nRosemary, Tony and all the colla tors.

Despite operating in the face of\na vigorously international market which is\nbeset by problems of over-capacity and over-production, BSC increased its energy\nefficiently by 10% last year, reduced man-hours per tonne of steel by 23% and cut\nlosses dramatically from \u00a3869 million to \u00a3256\nmillion.\nHow was this achieved?

If you found anybody,\nwell done, 'cos they weren't there!\nHowever, all is not lost because several\nkeen brewers in the first year have got\ntogether and have re-formed Brewsoc. They\nare now looking for new members.\nIf you have read this far, then you might be\nconsidering joining, and therefore be\nwondering just what we do. Brewsoc is for\nanyone who is interested in Very Cheap\nBeer, or Very Cheap Wine, or anything else\nthat we can brew,(not distill). Just as an\nexample, you can make beer as cheaply as\n6pa pint.

When\neveryone else is fighting\nover the TV, eating, drinking and having family\ntiffs, you could be making a name for yourself. It is\nquite easy \u2014 all you need\nto do is write a short story,\nar it cle or poem, or dash out\nand take some photos or\ndo some drawings \u2014\nperhaps even a cartoon\nstrip. Then just send it to\nthe Phoenix Editor, c/o the\nFELIX Office.\nWhat is the Phoenix?\nThe Phoenix is the\nliterary and artistic magazine of Imperial\nCollege. It was founded by\nHG Wells and is now\nproduced annually. The\n99th issue will be produced\nin the spring term. Last\nyear, a prize of \u00a330 was\ngiven to the best entry. This\nyear there may also be a prize for the best pictorial\nentry.\nThis year's theme\nThe Phoenix is often\nseen as an escape from\nCollege life by its contributors and readers.\nAs a result, science seems\nto be a taboo. This is not\nonly a waste of subject\nmatter, but it is also very\nsad.\nScience is an inescapable part of human effort \u2014\nas much as farming, manufacturing, painting or\nanything else that people\ndo. In the public eye,\nscientists are seen as a breed apart, not quite\nhuman. But we are all\nscientists here, and we\nknow that is not true. If we\ncannot rejoice in our work,\nthen something is indeed\namiss.\nThe theme for this year's Phoenix, then is science\nand technology \u2014 science\nand morality, science and\nmankind, the heroic failures of science, the lost\nsecrets of ancient science,\nconjectures about the\nfuture, and of course\neverything that comes\nunder the heading of\nscience fiction.\nMost important of all is to\ndemonstrate the unity of\nhumanity and scientific\nthought \u2014 one should not\nbe without the other.\nSo much for the theme \u2014\nI would especially like to\narrange all the articles\nchronologically \u2014 past,\npresent future. But don't feel forced to stick to my\nguidelines \u2014 if there is\nanything you feel strongly\nabout, do that.\nFinally, if you would like\na copy of last year's Phoenix, there are still a few left in the Bookshop\nand the FELIX Office, price\n30p. \u2022 The Phoenix Editor,\nDiane Love (Physics PG)\nmay be contacted via\nFELIX.\nTHE\nPHOENIX FELIX Friday 16 November 1984 15\n\n"

    "content": "ZREVIEWS!\nBOOKS\nSINGLES\nRay Parker Jnr: I still Can 't Get Over Loving You.\nThis is a re-release from last\nyear, and is meant to\ncapitalize on the top-ten\nsuccess of Ghostbusters. This\nhas a classic ballad style,\nhowever, and so will have a completely different audience. This is good though.\nHe's got an incredibly sexy\nvoice. I wish I could sing like\nthat.\nNick Heyward: Warning Sign\nAnyone who got as sick as I did with Blue Hat For A Blue\nDay is sure to be pleased with\nthis change of direction for\nthe ex-Haircut sex-symbol.\nHis rap technique leaves a lot\nto be desired, but the music is\ngreat. Lots of synth drums,\nlots of guitar \u2014 top 20 at least.\nMurray Head: One Night In\nBangkok\nFrom the new musical by\nTim Rice, and the male half of\nAbba, this is the first single.\nAfter a very disjointed eastern\nstart, Murray breaks into a funky chat rap, with a stunningly catchy chorus If\nyou've made it this far, the rest\nof the single is great. God know how they'll incorporate\nit into a musical though.\nHuey Lewis And The News If\nThis Is It\nWho likes old-fashioned\nbands like this anymore? But\nhang on a minute, is this really\nHuey Lewis I'm hearing on the\nturntable? But this is a good\nsong, with up to date\nproduction, and great lyrics.\nReally, is this Huey Lewis?\nMaybe I should rethink my\nmusical biases.\nPointer Sisters: I'm so Excited\nSo, the music sticks in your\nbrain and you think you've\nheard a good single, but isn't it\nabout time someone realised\nwhat American crap like this is\ndoing to the British music\nmarkets. Banal production,\nwith a naive lyric and three bar\ntune \u2014 talk about Automatic\npop. The I CCC computer\ncould write more meaningful\nmusic than this!\nCINEMA\nRefusal\nThere is a Film Society isn't there? Well someone's been\nputting them to shame recently with a brilliant\nrepertoire of films. Only 50pa time, every Thursday; some\njumble of letters\u2014 ICC ND? Last Thursday was no\nexception with the black and\nwhite film Refusal. It is a moving story of an Austrian's refusal to fight for Nazi\nGermany, sticking to his\nCatholic beliefs. The film\nfollowed his lonely struggle to\ndie an insignificant death as\nthough he had never existed.\n'Die like a peasant, like the\nnothing he is.' He is achieving\nnothing by his death. He is not\nremembered.\nThe film has no music, and\nproduces a strongly progressive documentary effect\nby breaking up scenes with\npresent day interviews with\nthe man's close friends and\nother peasants from his\nvillage. It ends with the words\nfrom one man, aside his\ntractor,\n'What can you say?' There\nwill always be war, I am no\nidealist, the film is worth\nseeing. I didn't realise they\nmade them so good in those\ndays.\nWe left the theatre in\nsilence, leaving the projectionist alone. Just like the\nman in the film, as insignificant as each one of us.\nTime Out loathe him, Litererary Review love him,\nThe Sunday Telegraph have\nnot a clue but they want to kiss\nhis ass anyway. The man is\nMartin Amis and he can\nWRITE. Dead Babies was reissued by Penguin this year.\nThe novel appears, at first\nsight to be a black comedy\nand little else. Amis has\ncreated a group of awful\npeople, put them together in a country house for the weekend, and made odd\nthings happen to them. The\nbook is set (and was written)\nin the mid seventies, and the\ncharacters are, on the whole,\nbored swingers who spend\ntheir time trying to do\nsomething outrageous which\nthey haven't tried already. The\noptions a je few, but they do\ntry.\nThe important theme is that\nof control. The characters try\nto control each other, but\nAmis keeps writing little notes\nto the reader to the effect that\nHE is the boss, and he can\nmake these suckers do\nwhatever he damn well likes.\nThe third set of controls are\napplied by the precision\nviolence of 'The Conceptualists' \u2014 requirements for\nmembership: a humanities\ndegree and a suit. These\nshady people are never\nencountered, but the threat of\ntheir presence underscores\nthe last parts of the book.\nAmis has superb technique,\nand style by the magnum. This\nis a rare sort of book \u2014 a readable masterpiece.\nM PER IAU COLLEGE RADIO\nIC Radio provides a tailor made\nmedium wave service on 999 kHz\nfor most of the halls of residence.\nFor requests ring IC Radio on\ninter enal3440.

    "content": "OPINION^\nTake your\npartners\nIC Dance Club is one of the very few clubs in\nCollege which can boast an almost 50-50\nmale female ratio, mainly because it attracts\nmany students from other colleges.\nIf you have ever fancied yourself quick-stepping around a dance floor, but on\naccount of your three left feet, haven't yet\nplucked up the courage to come along, don't worry. Our professional teachers can cope\nwith anybody. From those who have 'got de\nbeet', to those who wouldn't know rhythm if\nit jumped up and bit them!\nIf you are a complete beginner then the\nclasses for you currently run on a Tuesday\nand Wednesday at 8.00pm. These classes\nare taught by two charming young ladies\ncalled Christine and Kim, who aim to teach\nthe basic steps and turns of the waltz,\nquickstep, cha-cha, foxtrot and jive. Later\nsome rhum ba and samba is included.\nTo begin with everyone is tripping over\neveryone else, dancing into other couples,\nand generally chaos rules supreme! Soon\neverything calms down and you manage to\ncontrol both feet at the same time. These two\nclasses are usually a lot of fun as everyone is\nout to have a good time, and most succeed.\nThe classes normally start with a couple of\nsimple progressive barn dances, so everyone\ncan get to know each other, and partners are\nconstantly changed around during dancing.\nNext term there will be a new beginners\nclass starting, so if you are interested keep a look-out for the posters.\nThose of you who have danced before, but\nnot become particularly advanced, or have\nhad a break since dancing, may find the\nintermediate class on Tuesdays at 7.00pm the one for you. Here you will learn more\nadvanced steps to build on your basics, so\nyou will really be able to impress your friends.\nThe third latin/ballroom class is held on a Monday at 7.30pm, and is for more advanced\ndancers who have gone through the\nbeginners and intermediate stages in\nCollege, or who have danced for 6-9 months\noutside. The class is taken by a gorgeous\nyoung man know as 'Peach', who also\ndances professionally in shows and\ncompetitions.\nThe fourth class run by I CDC is intended\nfor those of you who really fancy yourselves\nin the discos, and want to 'Strut your funky\nstuff all over South Ken.lt is the jazz-funk-disco class which 'happens' on a Monday at\n6.30pm. As well as learning to dance you get\nto keep very fit and listen to some good\nmusic.\nAll the classes last for an hour, and\nmembership of I CDC is open to anybody, a snip at \u00a32 for the year. Each class costs\nbetween 50 and 75p pence, so it works out a very cheap way of having a lot of fun. If you\nare interested and want to know any more,\ncome along on a Monday, Tuesday or\nWednesday to the J CR in the Sherfield\nBuilding and have a word with any of the\ncommittee.\nAlthough our primary aim is to teach people\nto dance socially, some of our members want\nsomething more. Thus, we have two teams\nwhich compete at'University level; our first\nteam, consisting of the more experienced\ndancers, who enter both the Southern and\nInter-Varisty competitions, and our second\nteam who enter only the Southern.\nEach team consists of up to four couples,\neach dancing one of the four dances waltz,\nquickstep, cha-cha-cha and jive. In addition,\nthere are 'open' competitions for which we\ncan enter three or four couples over and\nabove team members. There is also an\n'offbeat' section, where each Dance Club\ngets the chance to present something\ndifferent, on the general theme of dancing.\nExamples include the origins of some dances\neg Pass the Duvet (Paso Doble), Dance of\nthe tea ladies (cha(r) cha-cha) and take-offs\nof adverts eg Heineken. This year we hope to\ninvolve those people who attend our jazz\nfunk classes, by choosing a subject and\nchoreographing an appropriate jazz routine.\nAny suggestions for a humourous subject to\nNeil McCluskey Chem Eng 1.\nindeed a colourful sight.\nCome the big day, the team and its\nsupporters board the coach bound for one of\nthe other Univeristies which hosts the\ncompetitions. On arrival, the team go to\nchange, the others to forage food. Dancing\nusually begins at 5.00pm, and the main\ncompetitions are interspersed with general\ndancing. There is always a professional\ndemonstration, to show us how it should be\ndone and by 1.00am everybody is ready to\nleave, clutching any trophies they may have\nwon (or mascots they may have stolen!).\nOur track, or should I say floor, record has\nimproved dramatically over the past few\nyears. Last year was our best year to date,\ncoming fourth overall in both the Southern\nand Inter-varsity competitions, and winning\nthe cha-cha-cha at the Inter-varsity.\nThis year, we have two full teams who are\nalready practising hard for their first\ncompetition, which takes place here at\nImperial. The dates for your diary are:\nNovember 17: London Ball, 6.30pm \u2014 12.00pm, J CR November 26: London v Cambridge,\nGuildhall, Cambridge.\nDecember 7: Annual Dinner and Dance,\n7.30pm1.00 am, J CR February 22: Southern Ball, Oxford\nMarch 9: Inter-varsity Ball, Cambridge\nTeam members take lessons with top\nLondon teachers in their spare time, as well\nas practising their routines during club\nnights. We try to encourage team spirit, and\nthere's nothing better after an evening's work than to relax with other club members\nin Southside and recall past successes (or\nfailures!).\nThe club provides the outfits for the\nteams, which cost hundreds of pounds, but\ndancers must provide their own footwear.\nFor waltz and quickstep, the girls wear the\ntraditional sequin ned dresses, incorporating\nyards of nit (very dangerous!) whilst, the men\ndon tail suits, dress shirts and bow ties. For\ncha-cha-cha and jive, the girls wear what can\nbest be described as not a lot, and the men\nwear cat suits and coloured shirts. When the\nImperial College team goes on parade, it is\nAnyone who wants to come and support\nus is most welcome, we take a50 seater\ncoach, so there's plenty of room! So, if there\nare any more budding world champions out\nthere, contact Annabel Mak now, either at\nour classes or via the Chem Eng Letter\nracks.\nFinally, it only remains for me to thank our\nteachers Peter Townsend, Geoffrey\nClapham (latin), Eric Donaldson (ballroom)\nChristine Norman, Kim Graves (general\ninstructors) for all the hard work they have\nput in, and to wish this years' teams all the\nbest.\nThis years committee: A Mak(Chairman),\nC Yates (Junior Treasurer), F Kondowe\n(Secretary), I Maxted (Publicity Officer), N McCluskey (Jazz Team Captain) D Caballero (Team Captain).\nFELIX Friday 16 November 1984 5\n\n"

    "content": "ESPORTZ_Z\nHOCKEY\nVictory at\nlast\nOn Wednesday IC recorded\ntheir first win of the season in fine\nstyle against the London School\nfo - Economics. All the players\ncontributed to an imp re sive all\nround team performance with,\ntight marking at the back,\ndomination of the middle (with\nexcellent Hockey from Morris)\nHedges and Ian Parker and the\noppositions half, this was\nespecially evident during the first\nhalf when both goals were scored\nby Geoff Ares, the first coming\nfrom a brilliant individual effort,\ntaking the ball into the D beating\nthe goal keeper and scoring with\na reverse stick flick the second\ncoming from a penalty flick.\nIn the second half IC\nconsolidated their position with\nsolid defending, they were\nperhaps a little unlucky not to\nscore again with several\nopportunites being foiled by the\nopposition.\nThanks go to Alan from RSM\nwho switched teams at short\nnotice to make an invaluable\ncontribution.\nTeam: A Stewart, I Parker, M Hedges, J Baxter, P Oliver, P Smith, J West, G Ayres, P Lufkin, Alan, KM Cormick and\nP Dubenski.\nIC 3rd XI\u20145 vs Harlow\u20141\nThe match started with a very\npromising performance from the\nwhole team. After conceding an\nearly goal against the run of play,\nImperial received the necessary\nmotivation to take Harlow by\nstorm. A goal by Per Dullforce in\nthe first half enabled IC to arrive\nat half time on level terms.\nThe second half then proved\nto be an exhibition, or the IC\nplayers dominated the\nopposition. Excellent defending\nby Mark, Craig and Chris with\ngood keeping by novice goalie\nAlan Howard enabled IC to keep\na clean sheet in the 2nd half. At\nthe other end good interplay by\nall the forwards allowed John\nSturgers to score four excellent\ngoals, bringing the final score line to 5\u20141.\nTeam: A Howard, M Cubitt, C Honey, I Mace, J Spencer, P Dullforce, SBrooker,JSturgess,\nC Harrison.\nBritish Airways\u20142 IC 1st XI\u20143\nA match which was expected to\nbe one of the hardest of the\nseason provided IC with their\nfirst win in the Middlesex\nLeague. Undoubtedly the most\nspirited performance so far, and\nthis led to some good hockey\nbeing played.\nThe forwards passed amongst\neach other well, creating many\nopenings. J Baxter played well at\ncentre forward, acting as a target\nman he slowed up the attack\nuntil he had support. Also the\nscorer of the third goal which\ncome after a sustained period of\nattack from BA. The half-backs worked hard\nand had the better of the\nopposition. Centre Half, POliver\nscored the first goal a sole effort,\nusing close control to weave\nthrough a maze of players and\neventually slip past the keeper.\nThe full-backs, although under\nen our mou s pressure during the\nsecond half, coped manfully and\nwithstood the onslaught. T West\nsaved the ' match on several\noccasions, notably in the dying\nminutes from a well struck short\ncorner.\nP Dubenski was the other\nscorer, a good firm shot from the\nedge of the D. SNOOKER\nSweet\nvictory\nIC\u20148 Tate & Lyle\u20144\n'We woz robbed' \u2014 that phrase\nneatly sums up the feeling in the\nIC camp after producing what\nwas probably the best\nperformance of the season so far\nto trounce a very com pet ant Tate and Lyle side only to finish\nwith an ag great e50 point deficit.\nThis apparent anomaly arising\nfrom the fact that some kindly\nsoul had blessed the visitors with\na very generous handicap.\nAdrian Feasby, Ian Grindall,\nand John West each won both of\ntheir frames with Javed Qureshi\nand captain, Mike Powell picking\nup one each.\nUnfortunately this being in the\nhandicap tournament the only\nscore of any importance is the\noverall points difference. This\nmatch leaves Imperial with a points score of plus one in the\ntournament so far and it seems\nunfair that such a good win\nshould have produced such an\nindifferent result.\nHOCKEY\nMixed\nHockey\nSuperior tactics took the whole\nteam past four ticket collectors\nin a mad dash to catch the train\nat Waterloo, after starting from\nCharing Cross! The late arrival\nof St George's, the opposition,\ndid not deter the team, and after\na friendly match of variable play\n(rugby, football, bits of hockey),\nthe game ended with a4 \u20140\nvictory for IC. Sergeant Pepper\n(John Spencer) and Sandra Rofe\neach scored a goal, Ian Howgate\nscoring two.\nTeam: Philip Chaudhury, Alice\nBanks, Ian Mace, Liz Clark, Ian\nHowgate, Louise Wakeling,\nAdam Hayell, Sergeant Pepper\n(John Spencer), Sandra Rofe,\nAngela Rowe, Duncan Wigney.\nFOOTBALL\nFELIX\u2014\nfast and\nopen game\nLinstead Hall - Felix 2\nFelix scored two excellent goals\nlast Sunday, in a fast and open\ngame against Linstead Hall.\nLinstead, who had the wind in\ntheir favour in the first half, tired\nthemselves quickly, while the\nFelix pack saved their energies\nfor the second half.\nHero of the day was Rob Shiels\nwho hammered both the Felix\ngoals into the Linstead net from\n40 yards.\nThe only casualty of the day\nwas Rowe, who retired clean for\nan early mud-bath.\nROYAL SCHOOL OF MINES\nASSOCIATION Friday 23 November\nwith Royal Marine Dance Band\n\u2014Centenary Dinner\u2014 Tickets: Room 303, Sherfield\nPRESCHOOL PLAY GROUPS ASSOCIATION Greater London Region\nAUCTION of\nBooks, Ceramics, Clocks, Glass, Plated and Metal ware,\nPictures, Collector's Items, Toys etc,\nin THE BOTANY COMMON ROOM, IMPERIAL COLLEGE, BEIT HALL,\nPRINCE CONSORT ROAD, S.W.7.( Behind the Royal Albert Hall and almost opposite\nthe Royal College of Music)\nat 2p.m. on\nSATURDAY, 1 7 th NOVEMBER, 1 9 8 U.

    "content": "ELETTERS;\ncontinued from page 2\nMiners\nDear Sir\nWith regards to the letter about Socialist\nSociety's mining dispute meeting.\nFirstly, the society completely refutes the\nclaim that there was a mob, of any kind,\npresent at the meeting. This claim is not, and\ncannot be, substantiated with fact and the\nsociety expect the claim to be withdrawn.\nSecondly, a collection was not made at the\nend of the meeting. No tin was passed round\nand shaken under people's noses. People were\nfree to make donations as they thought fit.\nThe fact that the author of the letter wishes\nto remain anonymous reflects either\nunprecedented levels of paranoia, or more\nrealistically that the author simply wants\ntotal freedom, without re cause, to smear\nSocialist Society, the striking miners, and\nothers at the meeting.\nWe are disappointed that you, as Felix\neditor, freely published such a far-fetched\nletter and more importantly withheld the\nauthor's name without good reason.\nYours\nRobert Turner\nPaul Simpson\nRight to speak\nDear Sir,\nI refer to the anonymous letter in last\nweeks FELIX concerning the SOC-SOC\nmeeting held on November 1 to which\nspeakers from the NUM were invited.\nIt is amazing how one's perception of the\nsame events can be so different. I wonder how\nmany people present agree with my\nsummary?\nThe miner, a face worker from\nBetteshanger in Kent began by describing\nhow his family first moved to his village after\nthe 1926 General Strike and how he had\nlearnt at an early age that his job was loaned\nto him for his working life to be passed on to\nthe next generation in the mining\ncommunity. He then gave a picture of the\npresent situation in the Kent minefields and*\nfinally the problems with the Police that\nbegan with the arrival of people connected\nwith the National Association for Freedom, a far right group who appear to be closely\ninvolved with the Working Miners\nmovement.\nThe Chairman thanked the speaker and\ncalled for questions \u2014 a young lady in the\naudience got up and attacked the speaker for\nnot recognising young ladies were present\nwhen he gave his address. He apologised\nimmediately by indicating that where he\nworked, at the 'face', there were not many\nladies present and that he was not used to\nspeaking to students. Not content with this\nthe young lady in question continued to make\nfurther statements and ask further questions\n\u2014 the speaker attempted to reply, each time\nthe young lady intervened. After about ten\nminutes of this I asked the Chairman, with\nhis permission in the traditional manner \u2014 ie\nI indicated with my hand I wished to speak \u2014\nwhether other people would be able to ask\nquestions as well.\nIt was clear that the young lady did net\nagree with the Chairman's decision and\nprom ply got up and left.\nWhether you agree with the striking miners\nor not, surely they like other speakers invited\nto Imperial College have a right to put their\nview. I am not sure whether it is normal\npractice at 'students meetings' to harangue\nthe speaker, I have always thought it is\ncommon courtesy to allow a right of reply.\nOne wonders then, which 'mob' the\nanonymous writer is referring to!\nYours sincerely\nJohn Fecamp\nfor the millions\nDear Sir,\nI write in reply to last week's letter 'Coal or\nFood'? The 'Lady' who 'stood up' against the\nNUM was given the chance to ask questions\nand make accusations (including some quite\nsharp insults) repeatedly, and not content\nwith this she persistently interrupted the\nspeaker who answered her questions\npleasantly and completely. Having received\nan intellectual thrashing she walked out, of\nher own accord.\nWhy should the author of the letter be so\n'astounded' by the support shown for the\nminers? We recognize that in the long run the\nminers' fight is everyone's fight: as the\nspeaker said, until we 'make our first million'\nwe should have no illusions about being\nanything but working class. What is\nincredible is that so many students, like the\npoor confused woman in question, should\ndecide to line up with their own enemy\nagainst their own class (unless, of course, her\ndaddy is managing director of some multinational company?).\nAs'for the money: yes, people did donate\nappreciable sums and over \u00a3130 was\ncollected. What right does anyone have to\nassume that those who have contributed to\nthe miners have not also contributed to the\nEthiopian fund? And if you really are so\nconcerned for the Ethiopian people why\ndon't you organize a meeting and raise some\nmoney, if you have not already done so? And\nwhilst you rally round your government\nagainst the miners, remember that for a long\ntime they deliberately wit held aid from\nEthiopia hoping that a famine disaster would\nbring down the Marxist government. And\njust as they were prepared to use the\nEthiopians suffering to their own political\nends, they now try to starve the miners into\nsubmission.\nIt would make a great deal more sense for\nyou to leave behind your misconceptions and\nconfusion and line up with those who are\nfighting for a society run for the millions\ninstead of for the millionaires.\nYours\nJulian Bammer\nCivil Eng 3\nFool\nDear Sir,\nWe were at the Miner's Support Group\nmeeting referred to by 'Name withheld by\nRequest' last week. The lady who 'stood up\nagainst them' (the two Kent miners speaking\nat the meeting) was not at all courageous. She\nwas self-righteous, pompous and insisted on\nmonopolizing the discussion, continually\nbutting in on other people's contributions to\npreach about violence on the picket lines. The\nstudent who was acting as Chairman\nadmittedly didn't help matters by saying so\nbrusquely 'I think we've had enough of this\ntopic'. After about ten minutes, but the lady\nconcerned only made a fool of herself by\nmarching out of the meeting. If she had\nstayed she would have head some interesting\n' contributions (not all supporting the miners)\nabout the real issue of the strike, which is not\nviolence or the picket-lines (whether from the\npolice or miners), but the right or otherwise\nof Government to inflict untold violence on\nthousand of British people by closing pits,\ndestroying livelihoods and whole\ncommunities in the process.\nIf only the lady could have taken off her\nblinkers and imagined herself in the miners'\npostion for once. The miners are scared,\nscared of losing their jobs their friends, their\nwhole way of life. When people are boxed\ninto an intolerable situation they fight back.\nThis Government, with its 'elective\ndictatorship' and 'government by standing\novation', seems to regard the miner's stride as\na Holy War akin to the Falklands War. But\nyou can't run a country by destroying the\nlives of its citizens \u2014 that's what we call 'mob\nrule'. The Government is there to serve all of\nthe country's people, not to create alienation,\nanger and despair through the tyranny of its\nideology.\nWe contributed several pounds to the\nminers fund (and several pounds towards\nEthiopian famine relief, as advised by your\ncorrespond ant last week). We are proud to\nhave done so. The government has finally\nwoken up to the crisis in Ethiopia after years\nof claiming the famine was being overstated\nby the regime there which 'just happens' to be\nMarxist. When will they wake up to the crisis\nin our own country? What levels of\nunemployment and poverty do they need in\nBritain before they decide we're 'taken our\nmedicine'?\nYours angrily\nAR Atkins EE III\nNMArran EE III\nFriday 16 November 1984 FELIX\n\n"

The minimum grant, will be abolished from next\nyear. And for the first time, tuition fees will be charged to a large number of parents. There will also be a tougher means\ntest for parental contributions.\nThe \u00a3205 minimum grant for\nliving expenses, currently\nawarded to all degree students\nregardless of parental income,\nwill be scrapped. In addition half\nthe parents with children in\nhigher education will have to pay\na proportion of their yearly\ntuition fees up to \u00a3520. This will\nbe the first time since the advent\nof the modern University system\nthat parents have been charged\ntuition fees. The parental\ncontribution to main ten ece grants will also increase\nsubstantially with increases\nranging from \u00a357 for a family\nincome of \u00a313,200 to \u00a3725 for an\nincome of \u00a322,000. For parents\nof a student living away from\nhome and studying in London\nthis will mean finding \u00a32,625 a year.\nThe changes do mean\nhowever, that 10,000 low income\nfamilies will not pay anything to\nsend their children into higher\neducation.\nSir Keith Joseph, the\nEducation Secretary, who\nannounced the details of the cuts,\nsaid that savings would amount\nto \u00a339 million.

    "content": "CFEATURE\nRIFLE AND\nPISTOL\nCLUB\n-a club of calibre-The College Rifle Range is open for business again after a lot of work by\nthe Holland Club and IC Rifle and Pistol Clubs. Here the new facilities are\ndescribed to whet the appetite of all budding marksmen\nSorry for the delay but will be pleased to hear\nthat this was due to the range being\nreconstructed to allow full bore pistols to be\nused in it. This means that we can now\nprovide facilities for shooting anything from a popgun to a0.44 magnum. Over half a ton of\narmour plating was carried into the range by\nmembers of the Holland Club and ICRPC\ncommittee to construct the new butts. The\nrange was completed and certified last\nTuesday by the Military. In case any of you\npotential new members out there have lost\nthe information sheet given out at Freshers'\nFair the range is in the College sports centre\nin Prince's Gardens, not more than five\nminutes walk from any lecture theatre. It is\nopen every lunch-time throughout the week\nand all afternoon on Wednesday. Joining the\nclub is only a matter of coming along one\nlunchtime and paying the yearly membership\nfee of \u00a32.50 to one of the range officers.\nThe shooting week is broken up into rifle\non Mondays and Fridays, pistol on Tuesdays\nand Thursdays and both disciplines on\nWednesday. Naturally, since most new\nmembers will have had little or no shooting\nexperience, coaching ses s s ions will be held\neach day for the first two weeks and will be\navailable at any time during the year to\nanyone interested. We also hope to be able\nto arrange for a professional coach to\nprovide training from time to time.\nThe club can cater for a wide variety of\ndisciplines for both the rifle and pistol\nshooters. The main rifle discipline is the\nprone position (that's lying down) but for the\nmore dedicated, and masochistic, there are\nthe kneeling and standing positions. We have\na large selection of match quality Anschutz\nand BSA0.22 rifles for general club use.\nThe pistols disciplines this year will include\nstandard pistol, that is two strings of five\nshots, each in ten seconds, two strings of five\nshots, each in twenty seconds and ten\nrounds precision. We also hope to construct\nsome turning targets to practice duelling in\nwhich the target is only exposed to the\nshooters for three seconds in every ten,\nduring which the shooters must raise their\npistol and fire one round before lowering it\nagain. We can provide a fair selection of 0.22\npistols and will have access to full bore pistols\nsuch as 9mm Brownings and a Colt 357\nmagnum many of which are of match quality.\nAs well as the regular full-bore pistol\nsessions the club will be organising a number\nof full-bore rifle trips to Bisley Camp. There\nwill be a Freshers' trip either near the end of\nthis term or the begining of next term,\nfollowed by two trips in March during which\nthe inter-CCU competitions will be held.\nPast experience has shown these trips to\nbe extremely popular despite the fact that\nBisley has a weather system unique in the\ncountry; one of torrential rain and gale force\nwinds most of the year round. Having said\nthat, the rare exceptions like during last\nyears inter C CU competition show that\nBisley can provide glorious sunshine.\nThe rifles, while tacky and rented, are in\n7.62mm calibre and have displayed\nsurprising accuracy out to and beyond 600\nyards. At times these rifles have shown a mysterious, metaphysical self-aiming ability.\nOne rifle in the hands of an RCS team\nmember struggled valiantly, against all the\nodds, to provide 9 consecutive bulls, but was\nunable to hold out against said team\nmember's subsequent nervous breakdown,\nfinally yielding a score of 49/50.\n(It has been noted that the various Bisley\nbars do quite good business on these\noccassions).\nOn a more serious note, during the\nsummer session the University of London\nhas regular competitions at Bisley and\nImperial College usually contributes a number of shooters to the team.\n(NB all the above mentioned Bisley trips\nare heavily subsidized).\nHowever, enough of full-bore. The\nmajority of the club's activities centre around\nthe small-bore rifle disciplines. In the past\nyears the club has entered several leagues,\nwith both A and B teams, but due to the delay\nin starting our shooting season we have only\nmanaged to arrange one regular league this\nyear, the league of London Colleges.\nTo compensate for this lack of\ncompetition we will be arranging a number of\nhead-to-head matches, entering a number of\nnational competitions and running a club\nladder. The competitive instinct is usually\nbrought to the fore during the inter C CU small bore competitions in March.\nAgain, for the more ambitious (and\ncapable) shooters the University of London\nruns two teams, and this is the only known\nroute to aUL shooting Purple.\nIn the past the pistol shooters in the club\nwere labelled as cowboys or latent Clint\nEastwoods, but although that part of our\nnature occasionally rears its head, we\nbecome much more success s ful last year.\nThe pin a cle of our success came with the\ninclusion of three of our members in the\nUniversity of London Pistol Squad, which\nwon the nationwide inter university Pistol\nCompetition last year, even though the UL Pistol Club was not officially recognised as a club, and hence received no grant. Hopefully\nthat position has now been rectified and we\nhope to continue our representation in this\nsuccessful squad.\nOn the Social side we hope to organise\nseveral events during the year including one\nor two club dinners held at rest au rents or\nhotel in the South Kensington area. The club\ndinners last year at The Rembrandt Carvery\nand Chompers, were great successes.\nAs a final inducement, over the past two\nyears we have developed strong links with\nthe French rifle club, ATC La Rochelle. Two\nyears ago an Imperial College team spent a week of very enjoyable competition in\nFrance, and last year a team from the French\nClub competed with us here in London. Not\nsurprisingly the French won on their home\nterritory and we won on ours. We have been\ninvited back to France this year, (hopefully in\nlate June early July) and with a change in\nstrategy, and a collection of suitably cunning\ntricks we hope to thrash them this time.\nAny potential members who are good\nenough shots and speak Freanch would be\ngratefully added to our team, since none of\nthe French speak any English, and non of us\nspeak French.\nSo whether you speak French or not, or\nhave never even seen a gun before in your\nlife, come down to the range and give it a go.\nChristmas Dinner\n\u2014as advertised last week closing date for\nbookings is\n1.00pm Friday 30 November\nUNION BAR\nPROMOTION\nMonday 19 November\nCourage Best Bitter\nOnly 45p per pint\nFriday 16 November 1984 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURED\nSCAB WIGHT A Cocktail of Entertainment\nWhile most people are aware of what Guild's Carnival involves, and the beer festival has\nno difficulty in informing its potential\ncustomers of what is on offer, the same\ncannot be-said for SCAB night. SCAB stands\nfor Social, Cultural and Amusements Board,\nwhich is merely a committee which overseas\nthe running of the performing societies\nwithin IC Union: Chamber Music, Choir,\nDebating, Dramatic, Jazz, Film, Operatic\nand The Orchestra. All of these societies,\nwith the sole exception of The Choir, are\njoining together to produce a night of\nentertainment as a part of Rag Week. Each\nsociety provides a light hearted contribution\nto make up one of the most varied evening's entertainment of the year.\nThe evening commences with the\nOperatic Society's performance of 'The Zoo'\nby Sullivan and Rowe. Set, not surprisingly,\nin London Zoo the Chorus arrives to\ndiscover a love-sick youth, Carbody, trying\nto hang himself because he believes his love,\nLaetitia, to be dead. Unlucky in death as he\nseems to be in love, he fails to kill himself at\nwhich point the Chorus - representing the\ngreat British public - walk off in disgust. With\nthe traditional storyline established, its\ncomplications are introduced through a medley of clever verses, with quick-fire\naction involving the hopeful lovers and their\nother, potential suitors. Despite yet more\nattempts at suicide, Carboy survives and -surprisingly enough \u2014 manages to marry\nLaetitia and all ends happily. The amusing\ndialogue, rapid action provides SCAB night\nwith a promising, and cultivated, start to the\nevening. This show was a storming success\non Tour this Summer and a polished\nperformance is assured.\nWhile The Orchestra are simply too large\nto fit upon the Concert Hall stage, they have\nproduced a trio, playing wind instruments,\nwho will be performing'Teddy Bear's Picnic'.\nThis is followed by the Debating Society's Balloon Debate in this type of debate, there\nare three characters who, it is imagined, are\nall in a balloon which is sinking and in danger\nof crashing. To reduce the weight and hence\nprevent the death of these occupants, two of\nthe three must be thrown out of the balloon.\nEach of the three characters make a short\nwitty and humourous, too,it is hoped -speech to justify to the audience why they\nSaxophone and silk shirts from\nKool Skool\nalone should survive. The audience are then\nable to ask questions and finally to vote. This\nyear there is an appearance by author,\nhomosexual is t and chat show favourite\nQuentin Crisp and Michael Newman will\nmake his now regular performance as Jesus\nChrist; modesty, as ever, prevails!\nAfter the interval, the Dramatic Society\nare performing 'Play It Again, Sam'. Woody\nAllen, that six foot two inches blonde\nbombshell has produced another rip-off of\nother peoples scripts, with this particular one\ntaking characters from 'Casablanca', 'Play It\nAgain Sam' concerns a young journalist\nwhose wife has deserted him so now he is\nlooking with a little help from Humphrey\nBogart, for. a nymphomaniac, a swinger, or\neven a salesgirl from Woolworths. In fact he's after anyone, as long as they are bright, witty\nand perceptive and have a bottom into which\nhe can sink his teeth. Woody Allen's script\nprovides never fails to deliver the laughs.\nThe Chamber Music Society concerns\nitself with a diverse range of music and for\nSCAB night is providing a Barber's Shop\nQuartet.\nThe music continues, in a different vain,\nwith Jazz-Funk from Jazz Club's 'Kool\nSchool' The group have been playing at a variety of venues in London over the past\ntwo years. They have developed their range\nand will be playing an energetic or exciting\njazz fusion of numbers, complemented with\nloud and tasteless stage costumes. Kool\nSkool outclass mediocre jazz-rock outfits\nsuch as Weather Report with powerful\nrenditions of such classic tracks as\n'Streetlife' and 'Rio Funk'.\nFilm Society, such that it is, providing the\nfinal part of the evenings entertainment with\nRichard Pryor - Live in Concert. Richard\nPryor is an American comedian, who has\nalso acted in a number of films, who tells rude\njokes very well, in the style of the more\nrecently famous Eddie Murphey.\nThroughout the evening, until 11.00pm, there will be a bar at the entrance to the\nConcert Hall serving beer and spirits.\nHamburgers will also be on sale.\nSCAB night is a most varied cocktail of\nentertainment, provided by societies who\nare very well experienced and able in\nperforming. The event begins at 7.30pm in\nthe Union Concert Hall (Beit Building, off\nPrince Consort Road). Entrance for the\nwhole event is \u00a31.50 and \u00a31.00 for late\narrivals who merely wish to watch the film.\nAll profit goes to IC Rag Charities.\nSCAB NIGHT\nTimetable\n7.40 The Zoo\n8.30 Teddy Bear's Picnic\n8.40 Balloon Debate\n9.05 Interval\n9.25 Play it again Sam\n10.40 Barber's Shop Quartet\n11.00 Kool Skool\n12.00 Richard Pryor Live\nFELIX Friday 16 November 1984\n\n"
