    "content": "M10 INTERVIEW 3 March 1998\nThe Many Faces of\nRobson Green Clare Ashwin tracks down the I Soldier Soldier hearth rob for an\nStrange events were taking place around\nHammersmith. Innocent medical students\non their way to a lecture were overwhelmed by the presence of a film crew outside\nthe Reynolds building and even more amazed to\nspot Robson Green, star of TV's Soldier, Soilder\nand one half of the successful singing duo Robson &. Gerome, calmly eating a sandwich!\nWell Iam never one to pass up an opportunity,\nand the lovely blok e agreed to be harassed by\nme, all in the name of journalism. So, after 15\nhours of filming (thats him not me), I asked\nhim...\nCLARE: So what were you filming for today,\nRobson?\nROBSON: It is for the second series of a TV\ndrama called Touching Evil which is about the\nmotives and psychology behind serial killers. I am a detective in the serial crime unit, it's not\nabout what they do but why.\nC: similar to Cracker then?\nR: Yes, very similar, it is written by Paul Abbott\nwho wrote many of the Cracker episodes. He is\na very talented guy who writes very truthfully, he\nis very good at adapting life's experiences and\nrelating them to his work.\nC: Wasn't he involved with Reckless too?\n(Shown on television last month, Robson starred\nalongside Francesca Annis as an english surgeon\nwho falls for his boss' wife.)\nR: Yes, it has also been nominated for an RTS\n?r half of Robson & Gerome and\nlu sive interview...\ndrama award. Paul saw me in The Gambling\nMan and liked my work so asked if 1 would be\ninterested in doing Reckless so we got together\nfor that and now we are working on a second\nseries of Touching Evil. The first episodes should\nbe shown about April.\nC: So what about the music career then?\nR:( laughs) Music career? Well.. 1 was actually a professional singer for four years before I became an actor. The singles recorded with\nGerome took off really quickly, it was weird. We sang the first single Unchained Melody in the\nseries and were approached by record companies wanting to release it, suddenly millions of\npeople were buying our records! It was fun but 1\nam glad 1 got out when 1 did. C: No plans for another single then?\nR:No! There is something rather corrupt about\nthe music industry, very fickle and competitive,\nthere is no sense of community... And you can\nquote me on that. (1 have!)\nC: What did you think of the Brit Awards and the\nwater-throwing episode?\nR:1 thought they were self-obsessed and self-conceited arse holes! It was a pointless act\nwhich effectively insulted the people that are\npaying thier wages. 1 wouldn't have done it, the\nwhole awards business is just for the music\nindustry.\nC: You met a lot of medical students today,\ndoes it worry you that the future of the Health\nService is in our hands?\nR:( laughs) No.1 have no worries about those\nthat have been through all their training. Iam not concerned about the standards but 1 do worry about those that are running the health\nservice from their offices, behind the scenes.\nThe doctors and nurses are overworked and\nunderpaid.\nC:M mm... might meet you at the other end of\nmy scalpel one day! What is it like being a celebrity then?\nR:( Groans) I don't feel like a celebrity and I hope 1 don't come across like one! I don't like\nplaying the celebrity, I don't do PR ev nts and\nhate doing live TV interviews. I will only do events to promote the project that Iam working\non. 1 think the musical part took off at the same\ntime as my acting career and I was worried that\nthe music may detract from the serious work\nbut luckily it has become more settled now so\nthe celebrity issue is not so important. Some\npeople live off their status but I don't want to be\nfamous for the sake of it.\nC:I was asked to find out which football team\nyou support.\nR:( grins) Which one do you think?\nC:Um... Newcastle?\nR: Yes! (Silly question really!)\nC:( Desperately trying to think of a new, interesting and original question to ask) So how do\nYOU eat your creme eggs then? (Oh my god. I can't believe I just did that.)\nR:( looks sup rise d then laughs) I don't eat them,\neggs are bad for you! C: Did you know that according to a survey by a leading women's magazine, you have been\nrated sixth in the \"Optrex Dew Drops Valentines\nEyes Survey\", beaten by Brad Pitt Iam afraid!\nR: The what?? I have no idea what that is all\nabout but Iam very flattered anyway! It is a compliment to my mum who has beautiful eyes\nand my brother too. He has great eyes. Its definitely genetic! Now blue eyes is dominant isn't it?\nC:( thinks: Brother? Hmmm. Blue eyes? Hmmm) I haven't really been to enough genetics lec-ture s, sorry!\nR:Ah! C: Well thats about it. unless you wish to add\nany s can de lou s details to give me a nice head-line...\nTHE VERDICT: Down to earth and very friendly\n(and the eyes are nice!) If you missed the last\nseries of Touching Evil then look out for the new\none in April. If you are a medic then look out for\nthe Charing Cross scenes in episode three.\nCheers Robson!\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS 13 March 1998\nFootball Club Fracas\n(Take Four)\nDAVID ROBERTS\nThe ICU Football team has landed\nitself in controversy once again.\nThe latest incident took place at\nthe Kensington Park Hotel during\nthe team's Annual Dinner, only two\ndays after a Union disciplinary\nfound the fourth team guilty of\nbringing the Union into disrepute,\nafter a match at Bath resulted in a string of complaints from Bath's Student Union.\nHaving booked the Hotel with\n\u00a3 5 0 0 cash - and thus without the\nprior consent of the Union - the\nteam then proceeded to enjoy\nthemselves in their usual fashion.\nConsequently, the Union found\nthemselves faced with a bill for\ndamages totalling \u00a3 1 0 3 4 on\nMonday morning. The bill includes\n\"an entire silver cutlery set and a painting, which had been torn\ndown and urinated over\". Faced\nwith the bill Andy He eps, ICU\nPresident, has declared that he will\nforce the football club to foot the\nbill or face disbanding.\nHowever, a football spokesman\nsuggested that the damage caused\nby the party should not be over-stated; \" A few expensive items\nwere borrowed from the hotel.\nThey will be returned... Otherwise\nit was no different from any other\nICU sports bash\". He went on to\nadd \"Kids ex. beer - they just don't mix\".\nComing on top of other ICU\nfootball related incidents this year,\nincluding the incident at Bath and\nthe destruction caused by the\nHammersmith pub crawl last\nNovember, which led to all IC students being barred from several\npubs, this is being seen as the last\nstraw by senior Union figures.\nSevere disciplinary action is\nanticipated.\nPlease Note There will be NO Felix next\nFriday (20 March). Watch out\nfor a special bumper Easter edition on Wednesday 25 March.\nNews in Brief.\nTHIEVES WASTE\nCOMPUTER\nA computing student and two intruders were involved in a fist-fight in the Huxley building last\nweek as the men attempted to\nsteal a laptop computer. Although nobody was hurt, the\ncomputer was broken in the scuffle and the thieves escaped from\nthe building unhindered. Ken\nWeir, Chief Security Officer,\nstressed that on no account\nshould any students put them selves at risk in this way, but\nshould call security, on 4 4 4 4 for\nimmediate action on any emergency or security alert.\n5th 'SABBATICAL\nA new sabbatical position will be\ncreated for 1CU in 1999 - 2 0 0 0 , if\na motion passed at last week's Union Council is approved by col-leg e. The position, to be contested in the elections next February\nwill add a Deputy President\n(Students Affairs) to the current\nteam. They will be responsible for\nthe welfare and academic affairs\nof students, currently undertaken\nby the President.\nThe same motion also recommended that the president of IC\nSchool of Medicine Students'\nUnion has sabbatical status for\ntwo further years before falling in\nline with the other CC Us. STUFF PINCHED\nResidents from Brabazon House,\none of Charing Cross' halls,\nreturned home last Friday after-noon to find the new video\nrecorder and Nintendo 64 games\nsystem absent. After a few hours\nof general enquiries it was concluded that they had been stolen.\nPreliminary investigations failed to\nreveal their whereabouts and the\npolice were called in.\nThe scene of the crime was\nsealed off while police investigations were carried out. There was\nno sign of a forced entry to the\nbuilding.\nMines Rock Teaching Awards\nThe proud teaching staff of Mines. Photo: Mark Smith\nTONY OFORI\nThe departments of Materials, Earth Resources Engineering and\nthe Centre for Composite Materials scored full marks in a joint Teaching Quality Assessment\ncarried out at the beginning of this\nmonth.\nThe assessment was conducted by the Higher Education Funding Council for England and is\npart of a national investigation into\nthe quality of university education.\nDuring the week long assessment a team of inspectors rigorously\nanalysed various aspects of the\ndepartments, classified as materials technology, ranging from curriculum design to student support.\nMore importantly the standard of\nteaching, learning and self-assess-ment was explored in detail to discover exactly how good the educational package is. It is important to\nnote that the primary objective of\nthe assessment was to ascertain\nwhe the t departments are meeting\ntheir attainment targets. However,\nthis is not to say that those which\naim low get good scores as the\nmark also reflects how the high targets are.\nThe Dean of the RS M, Professor Rees Rawlings, revealed\nin a meeting with students that\nthey had scored 24 points out of a possible 24. The assessors highlighted the excellent links with\nindustry, the high standard of the\ngraduates, unparalleled library\nfacilities and good staff-student\nrelations. No other institution has\nachieved full marks in this subject\nwith Oxford and Cambridge managing only 23 and old rivals\nCamborne School of Mines scraping 21. Other departments in IC\nwere also assessed, including\nChemical Engineering and\nAeronautics, but failed to score full\nmarks. Prof McLean, head of the\nMaterials department hoped that\nthis mark would go a long way to\ngiving the department \"recognition\nfor its high standards\".\nIn the meeting where the te sul t was announced, Professor\nTerezopoulos from ERE reminded\nthe gathering that \" Nobody is per-fec t\", to which the Dean replied, \"I think we're approaching it.\"\n\n"

    "content": "22\nSHATTER ME, BATTER ME, BREAK MY ANATOMY\nARTS 13 March 1998\nSALAD DAYS\nUnion Concert Hall\nO kay, so it's the morning\nafter, and I'm sitting here\ndesperately trying to write\nup my CV, when suddenly...\"We're\nlooking, we're looking, we're look-look look look looking....\" Oh, where was I? Oh, yes, I'm attempting to sum up the achievements of my illustrious career in a couple of pages of absolutely truthful and in no way exaggerated\nprose, when I'm distracted\nby \"We're looking for a PlANO!\" If by now you're wondering\nwhat the hell I'm talking about, I'm being plagued by the infectious\nmelodies and sparkly silliness of\n\"Salad Days,\" the show which has\njust finished a five night run aided\nby the silver tongues and twinkle\ntoes of Imperial College Operatic\nSociety.\nThe plot, as vaguely intimated\nin our preview two weeks ago,\nconcerns in some way that most\ninnocent of musical instruments, a piano. In fact, not just any old\npiano - but \"the one that maks you\ndance!\" The plot itself is, of\ncourse, highly spurious, being a chain of events of quite unrivalled\nimplausibility, strung shamelessly\ntogether and connected by links\nlacking in even the faintest trace of\ncredibility. This was, even more\nobviously, the intention of the\nauthors; the plot is simply a vehicle\nfor the songs, and an excuse for\nsome silly dancing - and let's face\nit, who needs an excuse for that?\nDuring the course of the show we\nencounter a magical piano called\nMinnie, who is in the competent\nhands of our heroes Timothy and\n|ane, a deliciously tacky nightclub,\nand the obligatory flying saucer\ncomplete with attendant aliens.\nThe whole show is peppered\nwith humour, ranging form the\nsurreal to the downright ludicrous,\nwith a few horrendous puns along\nthe way. The cast really use this to\nfull effect, and we are treated to\nsome truly priceless moments. One such occurs during an almost\nserious dialogue, when a nun roller-skates serenely across the stage,\nMartini-girl style, balancing a gin\nbottle above her head. Toward the\nend of the show, the magical\nMinnie is lost, and everyone and\neverything is thrown into chaos.\nThe entire population of London\nappears to be out in force searching for her, and this is where the\nimmortal\" look look look look looking\" occurs. Just when despair\nis nigh, darkness falls over the\nworld, and we witness the landing\nof the mandatory UFO, which looks\nsuspiciously like a Tardis. Here\ncomes what is possibly my\nfavourite moment in the whole thing; Troppo, one of the\nguardians of the piano, a wonderfully cute and timid character who communicates only through mime,\nis so terrified that he unfolds from\nhis pocket a brown paper bag, and\nplaces it over his head, this removing the cause of his fear. Now we\nmeet the occupants of the flying\nsaucer, a crew of lycra-clad aliens\nwith big hair and even bigger feet,\nwho danced in a most alluring\nmanner, their lycra tastefully cut to\nreveal one nipple. Of course, for\nthe spacecraft our heroes are able\nto spot Minnie, and return to earth\nto rescue her, saving the day. After\nthat, naturally, everyone gets\nmarried, and they all live happily\never after.\nNow we come to the bit you've\nall been waiting for - my verdict.\nFirstly, I was impressed by the\nchorus line, with excellent singing\nand diction, and some very stylish\ndancing - especially on the part of\nthe stripping nuns. There was also\nvery good singing from all the principals, some of whose songs\nweren't the easiest in the world to\nsing. There was a large amount of\nshameless hamming,( but what\nelse can you do with a script like\nthat?) although there was some\nvery nice acting, particularly as the\nsober Minister for Pleasure and\nPastimes, and the fragile camp tailor, who I only later discovered\nwere played by the same person.\nThe universal set was simple and\nfitted each scene well, and the\ncostumes were absolutely stun-ning, especially those wonderful\naliens. I left the hall in the mood to sing and dance, and had to\nconsciously stop myself from\ntapping my feet. I could add a couple more criticisms, but 1 don't think 1 will, because all in all I enjoyed the show so much! Abi Kirk\nCOSI FAN TUTTE\nShaftesbury Theatre\nW ith its improbable disguises and farcical\ndeceptions, Cosi fan\ntutte has often been visualise d as a frivolous entertainment, with a plot\nthat scarcely deserves the accomplished genius of his score.\" -Jonathan Miller, Director\nThis is a shame, because the\nfrivolity of the opera's plot highlights the theatrical conventions of\nthe time. Four lovers deceive themselves and each other by a mixture\nof disguises and good luck. In the\nsame way that Lois Lane can't recognise Clark Kent as Superman\nwhen he's wearing glasses, the two\nsisters cannot recognise their\nlovers when they're disguised as\nAlbanians. It sounds silly, and to a certain extent it is very silly, but the\nopera shouldn't be dismissed as\ntrivial. The \"artificial comedy\" demonstrates reality, without\nblindly representing it. It's the\nsymmetry of the plot, the four\ndeceitful/self-deceiving lovers, and\nthe two guardians of moral author-it y, Reason and Instinct, that\nmakes the opera so completely of\nits time. The librettist, da Plante,\nworked very closely with Mozart on\nthe opera, to produce a beautiful\npiece of theatre.\nI know that many people feel\nthat opera is irrelevant to their\nlives, they don't like it, they can't understand it, it's in a foreign\nlanguage, but don't dismiss it.\nOpera is universal, it isn't only put\non for the benefit of rich people\nand companies. It's a tragedy that\nmany people don't enjoy classical\nmusic; it's not boring or pretentious, and I'm not wie rd for being a fan. Of course you have musical\nsnobs, who elegantly sneer at you\nwhen you prefer Puccini to some\nobscure Yugoslavian composer with an unpronounceable name\nand impossible to listen to music.\nBut then there are indie snobs who prefer some unknown band to\nanything popular, despite the\ndifference in quality. In my ideal\nworld, this sort of musical snobbery\nwouldn't exist, and opera would be\nas popular R'n' B and indie.\nIam leaving the main point of\nthis article far behind, however. Do\ngo and see the production, it's bound to be amazing. The director\nis wonderful, and the opera won much praise from critics who know\nabout opera the first time around.\nIt'll be worth it. Really.\nJulia H More information on diary pages\nBOOKS\nCOMPETITION\nRESULT\nThe answer to the Waterstone's book of the month for March competition was:\nPurple America by Rick Moody\nThe lucky winner of a \u00a3 1 0\nvoucher is Ms( or is it Mr)\nBardanis.

Since then the entries\nhave been flooding in, resulting in\nthe destruction of acres of tropical\nrainforest, and the deaths of thousands of small fluffy animals. However, the effort has been worth\nit, as now IC Radio has a logo it can\nbe proud of.\nWe have had loads of entries\nwhich is wicked. Its a big fuck off to\nthose who accuse us IC students of\nbeing apathetic, although the fact\nthat the prize was \u00a3 5 0 of music\nmight have something to do with it.\nEntries from Imperial pissed over\nentries from other colleges in the\narea, who's contribution totalled a pathetic zero. Nice one kids.\nWith the quality of entries being\nso high, it was extremely hard to\npick a winner. We eventually narrowed it down to a short list, with\nexceptional entries by Richard\nDempers and Alastair Warman.\nHowever, the winner was announced live on air on Thurday\nduring John C's lunchtime show to\nbe Tony Broomfield.\nTony received his award at a secret venue somewhere in\nAmerica, and mysteriously in 1994.\nIn an emotional acceptance s peach he said \"I just like to thank everyone for voting for me.

Blueplanet\nrecords coming out of Germany\nhave gathered together a comprehensive collection of works, covering all styles of electronic music\n(hip-hop, downbeat, funky dub,\nup-tempo cyber-funk, techno and\ndrum 'n' bass). This all adds up to a highly original, deep and extremely\nfunky album.\nCD. 1 Digital Truth, get the journey underway with smooth strings,\na sample from what sounds like\nWar of the Worlds, down tempo\nbeats and some ruff scratching.\nThese CDs aren't mixed but you\nhat d ly notice as they are so well\narranged, real cohesion between\ntracks they just roll into one a no th er. Paradox-Daylight Robbery is a track that I instantly fell in love\nwith, a vocal sample most should\nrecognise, that works so so well\nwith the rugged 'n' raw beats.\nBlackbean sauce-Sfrefc/? is an\nout ' n' out rap hip-hop as is The\nNext Wavelength but in a totally\ndifferent style. It is amazing the\namount of styles featured here,\nshowing the true strength in depth\nthis music has.\nAlso out standing tracks by\nMung La Cream da la Cream\nsuperb bend y bass tone and the\nway the track builds is pure genius.\nMarc Williams-T/ ie Return of the\nProdigal Son raises the tempo with\na intelligent, funky rolling drum ' n' bass track, wicked horns, cool film\nsample and hard ' n' fast chopping\nbeats. The final three tracks keep\nwith the drum 'n' bass licks.\nThe second is more deep techno orientated often with a down\ntempo pace, with tracks by artists\nsuch as Air Liquid, Jammin' Unit,\nDr. Walker, and Atomic Dog.\nThis is music for the mind,\nmusic for the thinking man/woman.\nWhere every track has been made\nfor the love of the music, not commercial gain. Where every single\nbreak ' n' beat is there for a reason,\nmeticulous attention to detail. And I positive many many hours were\nspent programming these essential\npieces of listen to perfection. With\ntracks covering every sub-genre of\nelectronic music I can think of and\nthen some.\nA treat for the musical connoisseur and the open minded.\nNow to win your very own\ncopy of not only vol.2, but vol.1\nas well is tell me what country\nBluePIanet records are coming\nout of: A. Finland\nB. Wales\nC. Germany.\nEntry as normal, E mail\nt.j. morgan, ic.ac.uk. JP\nJOHN B VISIONS (New Direction) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe Man Behind The Music\nT his debut album from John B is again in that jazz D& J5\nfusion style which is coming on strong recently. You get two CDs (Organic cover the jazz experience and Synthetic which covers\nmore normal D&B) or a very nice\nvinyl box set for your money.\nCD1. Organic is a full on jazz\nD& \u00a3 affair that I have to say is con-CLUBSCENE - ALBUMS\nstruct ed superbly, with John classical training shining through the\nproductions, which ate full of funk.\nThe jazz influences are very\nprominent, but not so much as to\nput off an open minded drum &.\nbass fan. Some of the inspired\npieces of work are jazz Sessions 2.\nI 've never heard a trumpet sound\nso good, and it sound as if it could\nbe recreated using live just instruments ? but still tet a in s a very funky\njacking drum bass track. Slam\nFunk (moog mix) and Jazz Sessions\n1, a awesome college of beats and\nlive instruments and when it drops\nin you know all about it. Future funk\nin full effect.\nCD2. Synthetic is described as\na harder analogue tip which is just\nstandard drum &. bass to you and\nme. By that I do not mean to imply\nunoriginal ot not cutting edge\nmaterial, but unlike the first CD it\ndoesn't exploring just one style to\nthe max.\nThis CD is mixed to perfection\ncombining ten tracks all created by\nthe one man. Starburst sets off\nwith an intro that could be from\nChariots of Fire then it pans out to\nbe a top notice roller. This is one of\nthe things I love about D8J5 is that\ntheir are no rules, you can use any\nsound or sample you like as long as\nit works.\nThis is so impressive, it could\nbe a standard set you' d hear in a club or mixed CD you would never\nguess that all this is one mans work\nas each track is so different and so\nstrong, there's no real running\ntheme. When you think about it\nmost other D8J3 albums being\nreleased to date are ether a compilation of various artists, or feature a lot of remixed old material as well\nas new. Very few single artist\nalbums have featured 21 tracks\nwith the majority being totally new\nmaterial. The man is a genius.\nSo many styles are covered\nhere. The jazz element being\nexplored to the outer limits, dark\nmenacing numbers, futuristic step-per s, intelligent crazy kut t up break\nbeats. So by the looks of it this is\none of those must have pieces of\nwork, that'll be talked about and\nplayed for years to come. JP\nGARAGE DRUM 'IM' RASS\nH Life Feat. Da Scat Cat.\nLifeguard\n(Suth Based Prod.) Mid March.\nIt's been awhile since the last\nrelease from the fairly new Hi-Life,\nand this latest offering could well\nput them centre stage, with the\nrecent trend towards \"The Smooth Groove\". With the it trademark\nsoulful licks, sub-bass tones, clever\nkeys and those powerful vocals\nfrom Da Scat Cat it's sure to be big\nin the clubs. With mixes to suit dub\nmonsters and classic vocal styles.\nRBM. Strong Loving EP.\n(Ripe n' Ready) Out Now.\nQuality vocal and dub/speed\ngarage mixes on this one. The\nbeats ' n' bass roll along behind\nprominent keys and a fine female\nvocal on the more vocal mixes. The\none I 've been playing is the\ndub by/ speed mix, where the rolls\nare reversed, strong solid beats,\nstabs of keys and a cut ' n' looped\nvocal with a sub-bass that is worth\nthe wait. Guaranteed to keep the\nfloor moving, but the vocal can be\na bit repetitive and annoying on\nheavy listening.\nPrimary Motive. Venom /S( Creative Source) Mid march\nSmooth chopped up beats roll and\nbuild over what sounds like underwater atmospheric als and whale\ncalls 'n' sonar sounds, then in\ndrops the deep bass tones, completing the seascape in your mind.\nThe imaginatively titled S has very\ncleverly arranged beats, difficult to\nexplain with dreamy keys and\nat mos. and s ut tle touches of sax\nand ahh ahh female vocal blend\ninto the beats. Another first class\noffering from this label that never\nceases to impress me.\nChemical Pilot. (Eruption)\nAstral Dominoes (mixes) March.\nYou get remixes by Decoder, Matt\nSchwarz and Profound Noize, all\nto a very different end results.\nDecoders mix give it a Krust sort of\nfull length roll out, nice use of\nmorse code sounds, tough beats\nwith an un-intrusive dark wah wah\nbassline. Matt mix is much more in\nya face, fast hectic beats, time-stretches. Profound Noize funk up\nthe beats, strong bassline. If you\nlike a touch of darkness now 'n' then, and something a little different it's well worth hunting down.\n\n"

    "content": "13 March 1998 COLUMNS\ne) QUO3 LTD ROASTING - Part 1\nTo continue the oven theme I thought I'd do a little resume of roasting techniques. Roasting\nis one of my favourite methods of cooking and\nhas loads of advantages e.g. the food tastes\ngreat, you don't use much fat, it's ridiculously\neasy and it keeps the place warm. A few general points to start with. Roasting\nimplies using a quick, fierce heat. For meat this\nmeans you need a good quality piece of around\nfour pounds so get some friends around. The\noven needs to be very hot when the food is put\nin, generally 220\u00b0C, gas mark 8.\nRight, first off, Beef. Suitable cuts include\nsirloin (expensive), silver side and chuck. Have a chat with your local family butcher and decide.\nWhilst your oven is warming up, wipe the joint\nwith a damp cloth, season it with salt and pepper and place it in a roasting tin with some fat.\nThe best fat is of course beef dripping but butter will doI suppose. You'll need about 1 oz per\npound of beef. Put the roast into the very hot\noven and leave for 10-15 minutes to sear the\nmeat and then reduce to 180\u00b0C, gas mark 5.\nYou'll need to baste the joint every 30 minutes\nto keep it nice and moist (this involves removing the joint from the oven with an appropriate\ninsulating thing, pouring the fat in the tin over\nthe meat using an large spoon and putting it\nback in the oven).\nTotal cooking time = 20 minutes per lb +\n10 min for joints without a bone, or 15 minutes\nper lb + 15 min for joints with a bone.\nLamb. The only piece of lamb I reckon is\nreally worth roasting is the leg. All the other bits\nare best grilled. A really tasty way of seasoning\nthis is to insert slivers of garlic into the leg by\ncutting deep holes into it using a long thin knife\nand pushing slices of garlic right down the cut.\nThen rub with olive oil, salt and rosemary. Place\nRoast Duck (not featured on this page)\nin the hot oven for 10 minutes and then reduce\nthe heat to 180\u00b0C, gas mark 5 for the remaining\ntime. No basting involved.\nTotal cooking time = 25 minutes per lb +\n25 min for medium cooked, 30 minutes per lb\n+ 30 min for well done.\nPork. I recommend( but again, your local\nbutcher is the expert) that you use leg, loin or\nshoulder for roasting, with or without a bone. If\nyou like crackling, buy a joint with its skin still on\n(this also removes the need to baste the joint.\nBonus). Either way, score the top side of the\njoint with a sharp knife down to the flesh, rub\nwith oil and seasonings. You can use practically\nany herb, spice or combination on pork. I'm particularly partial to a mixture of salt, pepper, cin-nam on, mustard (powder) and sugar but garlic,\ncloves, bay, laurel etc ad nausea m are all excel-lent. Once flavoured, put the joint in a tin and\ninto the oven at the usual 220\u00b0C, gas mark 8.\nAfter 10 minutes reduce to 180\u00b0C, gas mark 5\nfor the rest of the cooking time. If the joint does\nnot have any skin, baste every 30 minutes.\nTotal cooking time = 35 minutes per lb +\n35 min for boned joints, or 30 minutes per lb +\n30 min for joints on the bone.\nThat's all for this week, I 'll do fowl and vegetables next week. However, a quick word on\ncarving (cutting up the roast): it's an extremely\ncomplicated subject that demands a lot of skill\nand practice. Needless to say I 've got neither so\nI just hack whatever it is to pieces. Oddly\nenough, it tastes just as good. Antoine\nThought For the Day\nHomeless and Hungry\nFresher s, Romans, country-men, pin back your ears. Land\nis very expensive in London.\nWe don't have nearly enough Halls\nof Residence at this fine establish-ment. This is demonstrated invariably by surveys such as the Times\nGood University Guide, in which\nImperial's biggest Achilles heel,\nespecially in deference to those\nupper-crust ies at Oxbridge, is its\nwoeful lack of accommodation.(1 said accommodation, not women. Honestly, do you never think about\nanything else?) The unfortunate\npractical upshot of this is that you are going to have to find some where to live next year. I see you hadn't thought of that. Planning to\nget another place in Hall were you, or just sleep on someone's floor?\nPerhaps you could crash out in the\nservice duct at the end of the land-ing. Sorry, guys, the\nAccommodation Office just isn't that philanthropic.\nMost folk in Hall last year knew\nprecisely with whom they would be\nliving, when and where, by the end\nof the first term. If you have not\nconsidered these finer points yet, it\nisn't worth expending precious\nadrenal in; these good intentions\noften falter when the individuals\ninvolved find that rather than being\nblood brothers for life, they are\nutterly sick of the sight of each\nother by the Summer Term. When this happens, students end up\nsharing an expensive, draught y, cold, Victorian flat in Earl's Court /\nSouth Kensington / Bayswater\n(delete as appropriate) with the following lot: one smelly heavy metal\nenthusiast, complete with guitar\nand 7 4 7 - size amplifier; one\nEngineering student with horn-rimmed glasses, six computers and\na distinct lack of social ability; one\nalcohol-blooded Southside Bar res-ident, displaying an advanced talent for stomping up the stairs at 4\nam and managing to knock every-thing, and I mean everything, over;\nfinally one trance - garage - house -drum 'n' bass - trip hop enthusiast\nwith a stereo capable of shattering\nStonehenge and nine ounces of\n\"personal use\" hashish stashed\nunder his bed, making everyone in\nthe house paranoid for their entire\ntenancy. Once you've got the\nplace, the fun but starts. If your\nrent includes bills, you are blessed\nindeed; there's nothing quite like\nspending a Sunday afternoon\nanalysing the 'phone bill and accusing each other of spending \u00a3 2 0 on\n0 8 9 8 numbers. Expect to start getting on each other's nerves by week\nthree - week four if you are\nextremely lucky. If you are all\nbruise-free by week six, consider a career move towards counselling. 1\nalso confidently predict that\nnobody will wash up, empty the\nbins, tidy the kitchen, hoover, clean\nthe bath and to liet s, or anything\nelse, until blood is spilt. And who's going to clean that up?\nChoose insurance. Choose a TV\nlicence. Choose paying the bills\nearly. Choose a house with a dish-washer, and a lounge. Choose #50\nrent per week with no shared\nrooms. Choose a flat mate with a Playstation. Choose the biggest\nroom. Frankly, after four weeks of\nfruitless searching, you will choose\nthe only place you can get. just\ndon't blame me when the windows leak.\nAH Campbell\n\n"

Says the\ndocument: \"The College will continue to involve its students\", whatever they are, \"through the\nImperial College Union, in discussion on all policy and administrative matters concerning students'\nsocial, cultural, welfare, sporting,\nacademic and other appropriate\ninterests.\"(it was written in the\ndays when sport and cultural activities were still permitted by the\nLegacy).

    "content": "13 February 1997\nREVIEWS AND COMPETITIONS\nFILM 19\nAS GOOD AS IT GETS\nStarring: Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Cuba Gooding Jr\nDirector:|ames L Brooks \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nA romantic lead who suffers\nfrom obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder must be a first for\nHollywood, but that is the situation\nin the excellent As Good As It Gets.\nJack Nicholson never uses a bar of\nsoap more than once and always\nswitches the light on and off exactly five times before feeling comfort-able. An acerbic-tongued romantic\nnovelist, Nicholson takes pride in\nhis ability to condescend, offend\nand wound. First introduced to the\naudience as an \"animal-hater\", who disposes of his neighbour's dog down the trash chute, he soon reveals himself to also be a racist,\nhomo ph obe, misogynist... In\nshort, this man is abhorrent and will\nno doubt offend many sections of\nthe audience.\nThere is only one person in the\nworld who can tolerate Nicholson's sarcastic tirades. Helen Hunt is a waitress who works in Jack's favourite cafe and has a special\nrelationship with the dysfunctional\nloner. This is enhanced when he\npays for hospital treatment for her\nasthmatic son and soon this flash\nof generosity has surprising consequences on all around.\nOnce again Jack Nicholson proves himself to be one of the\nbest actors in Hollywood today.\nOne of the few individuals who could handle such a complex role,\nhe delivers it with great conviction\nand deserving ly won a Golden Globe Award for best actor this\nyear. It will be a travesty if he fails\nto make it a third Oscar as well in a couple of weeks.\nLast seen in the 1997 summer\nblockbuster Twister, Helen Hunt\ndelivers her best performance to\nWin As Good As It Gets\ntickets and dressing gowns\nwith the\nODEON\nKENSINGTON\nThis week the Odeon Kensington\nhas donated five pairs of tickets\nplus five dressing gowns identical\nto those in the film. To have a chance of seeing the hilarious film\nfor nothing, just e mail\nfelix@ic.ac.uk with the answer to:\nWhat is jack Nicholson's full real name?\nLast week's Good Will Hunting\ncompetition was very popular, with\nmost of the entrants knowing that\nRobin Williams was nominated for\nan Oscar for roles in Good Morning\nVietnam, The Fisher King and Dead\nPoet's Society. Congratulations to\nthe winners who have now been\nnotified.\nICU CINEMA FREE SUNDAY SHOW\n8:00pm, Sunday 22 March THE THIRD MAN\n\"Fresh each time you see it - this\nfilm has no sell-by date\"\nBarry Norman ICU Cinema's next free Sunday\nshow is one of the greatest British\nfilms of all time. The Third Film is\none of those rare films that has had\nan irrevocable effect not just on the\nart of film but also on society as a whole. Set amidst the torn remains\nof post-war Vienna this is a mixture\nof film noir, suspense and action\nthriller, with a vicious comic lilt.\nAmerican pulp writer Joseph\nCotton arrives in the Austrian capital only to discover that the friend\nwho waited for him (Orson Welles)\nhas been killed under strange\ncircumstances. He then sets out\nlike a sleuth from a second rate\nnovelle tte to uncover the killer.\nThe award winn ning cine-mato graph y, sarcastic script and\nhaunting music create a complete\nfilm. John\nJack Nicholson plays the vicious (but funny) Melvin\ndate in this film. Matching Nicholson with a Golden Globe and\nOscar nomination, hers is the only\nstraightforward character in the\nfilm, yet she gives such an endearing performance that she avoids\ndiss appearing behind Nicholson's on-screen antics.\nAll in all, this might not be quite\nas good as cinema gets, but it is\ncertainly a refreshingly intelligent\ncharacter-driven comedy which deserves its seven Oscar\nnominations. U Choon\nWAG THE DOG\nStarring: Dustin Hoffman, Anne\nHeche, Robert De Niro\nDirector:Barry Levinson\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 y2 Wag the Dog is a satirical\nlook into how the media\nand the American public\ncan be controlled and deceived by\nsmart thinking and a big budget.\nThe film stars Robert De Niro as a fast thinking and talking spin doctor brought in to revive the\nAmerican President's reputation\nwhen, less than two weeks before\nelection day, a scandal erupts and\nthreatens to cripple the bid for a second term. Anticipating the press\nattention, De Niro creates a bigger\nstory, a war. With the help of\nDustin Hoffman, a, successful film\nproducer, he brings together a range of unlikely people together\nto orchestrate a global conflict to\nrival any Hollywood production.\nThe combination of De Niro\nand Hoffman's smart thinking produces a cascade of events, that get\nmore and more outrageous and\ndaring, in the effort to last out the\n1 1 days before the polls open.\nThere are great performances\nfrom both the leading actors as the\ntwo characters keep playing off\neach other in order to keep deceiving the press, the public and the\nCIA. The film has a very topical plot\nwith the scenario being not entirely\ndissimilar to that being faced by\nPresident Clinton involving the\nalleged sex scandal and the Gulf\nwar.\nAll in all, this is a clever film\nworth watching for its outrageous,\nyet quite believable, plot and the\nquality performances. D lit\nLESBIAN AND GAY FILM FESTIVAL COMPETITON\nLast week we were offering two\nfree tickets to see Les Voleurs at\nthe London Lesbian and Gay Film\nFestival. The answer to \"In which\nfilm did Catherine Deneuve star\nwith Susan Sarandon and David\nBowie?\" was The Hunger. The\nwinner is Chris Grant.\n\n"

You don't have to\nhave held a season ticket, travelled\nhundreds of miles to see Doncaster\nplay a meaningless home game, or\nturned out on a freezing, wet January evening to see Luton in the\nAutowindscreen Shield to understand what lies at the heart of an\napparently unpatriotic decision. No, one only has to care about\nfootball and be concerned at the\nstrengthening hand of commercialism and merchandising in the\ngame. These are aspects of the\nmodern game which are increasing\ncontrolled by a vain, soulless band\nof people who buy the gear now that football is fashionable but do not actually ever turn up to a match. You only have to visit\nalmost any town or city in Britain to\nbe appalled that Manchester United replica kits outnumber any\nother team. This is the modern social problem of the popularisation of football which has manifested itself largely upon Manchester\nUnited, presently by far the most\nsuccessful team around. This must\nnot be taken wrongly by genuine\nReds fans who will realise along\nwith fans of the game that the current manager and team are the\nbest package the English game has\nseen for years and the vast majority of those who pack Old Trafford\nare as genuine as those who rattle\naround in Belle Vue or Spotland.\nThere is nothing wrong with not liking football, each to their own, but\nwhat is irritating is the ManU td culture of pseudo-fans who are only\ninterested because football is in\nfashion and have tried to share in\nthe club's success by just buying a shirt or using a ManU td product. In\nthe process almost all other league\nclubs are damaged, especially second and third division ones, as the\ngulf in money and interest between\nthe top and bottom in football is\npulled further and further apart to\nthe point where clubs fold. This will\nbe illustrated next Wednesday when any bar or big screen will be\ntwice as full for the return leg than it\nwould be if any other English or\nScottish team represented the UK in\nEurope. I'm afraid that this now\nrepresents the unacceptable face of\nfootball and the sycophants\nattached to ManU td are the worst\nand most persistent offenders. It\nmust be best for all who genuinely\ncare about the British national game\nto see Monaco leave the Theatre of\nDreams victorious and put a brake\non this runaway delirium.\nRichy 'Digger' Brown\nGLIDING PLEA\nDear Felix,\nIam writing, on behalf of\nImperial College Gliding Club, to\nthank everyone who came to visit\nus on Thursday 5th when we had a glider parked on the Queen's Lawn.\nFor those people who didn't know\nabout this, our reason for doing so\n(apart from it being the club's68 th anniversary) was to advertise our\noffer of an introductory flight for\nhalf-price (i.e. \u00a39 instead of \u00a318) to\nanyone who joins the gliding club\nthis academic year.\nAn introductory flight consists\nof a briefing by a qualified in st ruc tor, followed by a1020 minute\nflight (dependant on weather con-ditions) in our two-seat training\nglider. Membership of ICGC allows\nyou to continue learning to fly in\nour gliders at only 12p/ minute (free\nafter 2 hours), and also makes you a member of La sham Gliding\nSociety (the biggest gliding club in\nthe country) where we are based.\nLasham has the best launching\nfacilities in the country, and our\nlaunch fees are sub sidi sed by the\nUnion giving us a40% discount.\nThis means that on a good day in\nthe Summer when flights of 5 hours\nor more are possible, you can take\na winch launch and spend the day\nracing around the countryside using\nnature's energy, for less than \u00a3 2 0 .\nThe best gliding weather is from\nMarch October and, although it\ndoes take a while (40-60 flights is\naverage) to go solo, learning is part\nof the fun. Gliding is one of the\ncheapest and most enjoyable ways\nof learning to fly, even at non-uni-vers it y clubs where flying similar\ngliders costs around three times as\nmuch. We also run sub sidi sed courses and tours during the holi-days, and experienced members\ncan train to become instructors, and\ntake part in cross-country competitions (where pilots race each other\non tasks of around 100-500km) and\naerobatics competitions.\nGliding is a satisfying, fun and\ndiverse sport, suiting both people\nwho just want to \"get away from it\nall\" at the weekend and people who want to combine exhilarating flying\nwith an intellectual challenge.\nICGC has the gliders, facilities and\ninstructors to train people from\ntheir first flight up to solo standard\nand beyond. The best example of\nthis is ex-student member Afandi\nDarlington who started gliding with\nICGC and, at the end of his 4 year\nAeronautics degree, came 2nd in\nthe British Junior Gliding\n5\nChampionships.\nIf anyone has any\nquestions about ICGC or\ngliding in general, then Email me on Error! Bookmark not\ndefined, and I will be glad to help.\nAlternatively, we have weekly\nmeetings (Thursdays 1-2) in\nAeronautics Room254 where people can join the club, arrange to go\ngliding and find out more. Our\nmain aims are to give everyone the\nchance to find out what gliding is\nlike and to help people to progress\nas fast as their money and free time\nwill allow. If you have any comments and suggestions about how\nwe can make gliding more accessible to students, I would be very\ninterested to hear them\nThanks for your time everyone,\nAndy Holmes, ICGC.\nPS. Anyone who would like to try\ngliding, but doesn't want to \"gam-ble\" their membership fee before\nthey find out if they like it, can book\na non-member's introductory flight\nfor \u00a3 1 8 . We will reduce your membership fee by \u00a39 (to \u00a320) if you\njoin the club on the day of your\nintroductory flight.\nPPS.

I got a fax\nfrom Wiija Records telling me they\nhad a couple of spare tickets to see\nCornershop and I was brimming\nwith anticipation hours before the\nband came on stage. I have been\nlistening to their When I Was Born\nFor The Seventh Time LP non stop\nsince Christmas and have been\nhooked on the melting pot of pop, Hindi song influences, hip hop,\nsonic mashed up grooves and even\na bit of country and western. The\nthought of experiencing this\ndelightful amalgam of sounds was\ntoo good to\nbe true, and I headed down to\nMalet Street\nfor a chilled\nout dusted down gig of\na lifetime.\nThe view\nI got as 1 had\nmy hand\nimprinted with a bit of\ncheesy UL U humour( This Is\nHardcore?!) was of the whole venue seething\nwith masses of people, an apparently totally up for it crowd, but\nhow wrong could 1 have been. UL U was once an excellent venue for\nbands such as Corner shop but\nrestrictions have limited the general feel and atmosphere of the\nplace. Now, bands have to leave\nthe stage before 11 pm! The strains of Sleep On the Left\nCornershop's frontman Tjinder in a rare\nmoment of en light ment. Side powered out complete with\nthe bass heavy undertones, and\ninstantly it was clear what attitude\nthe band was exuding into the initially eager crowd. Firstly, singer\nTjinder Singh was the only member\nout of the five who was standing.\nSecondly, he refused to even\nacknowledge that the crowd was\nthere. What is that all about? We aren't mind readers lads! Were we\nsupposed to believe that they were\nactually celebrating inside about\nthe end of their triumphant recent\ntour and that they were really s ooo happy to be there. Well, it worries\nme if they were; I'd hate to see\nthem during a bad patch.\nIt is hard\nto decipher\nthe animosity Corner shop showed to\ntheir fans,\nthough 1\nwouldn't go\nas far as to\ncall it aloof-ness. Many people parted with good money to\nwitness the\nCorner shop spectacle live\ntonight, and it would have been\npolite if they had at least recognised this. The band's mood of\nindifference seeped into the fans,\nwith even the awesomely catchy\nBrimful of Asha only causing a minor stir of response from the\nthrongs at the front. This previous\nnumber one should have caused a riot but the lack of any enthusiasm\nand energy on the part of the band\nTHE HYBIRDS\nTheHybirds \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nA hybrid of monkey and man;\nthis is what 1 thought Richard\nWarren, lead singer and songwriter for the Hybirds, was.\nThis isn'ta bad thing. Some fine\nmusic has been made by persons\nwho mostly resemble our primate\nrelations. There's Ian Brown and\nerr... well, Steven Tyler and err...\nAfanis Morissette. That Lee Evans is\na funny blok e as well, isn't he?\nAnyway, monkey business aside,\nWarren's songs paint a picture that\ntells of hard working, earthy and\nrealistic intentions. There's a wonderfully gritty couplet in the climactic Stranded: 'Picture you, picture\nme, living life in harmony; I don't think so. Picture me, picture you; do you make me feel brand new? I don't think so.'\nThis album is perfect for the post-Oasis crowd. It's good solid rock.\nMost songs start with an easy intro\nbefore building into great big raucous endings. Check out the classic\nrock n' roll cries of 'Yeah, yeah,\nyeah!' at the end of Stranded and\nthe gratuitous ' Oh yeah\"s on the\ncheesy rock anthem that is Bom Yesterday. There also seems to\nhave been a raid into the intro\nmeant it got exactly what it\ndeserved - nothing! Few other\nsongs from the recent long player\nwere spewed out with infuriating\nnonchalance, and the slightly older\nJullander Shere (surprisingly well\nreceived by the fans) started\npromisingly enough but then turned\ninto a looping frenzy of psychedelia\nthat drifted on for a staggering 20\nminutes, which left most people\nfeeling faint and close to being\nphysically ill. It was a poor attempt\nat a trance d out blitz that ended\narchive when making this album.\nThe Beatles feature on the opening\ninstrumental. Oasis' s 'Take Me Away' sounds uncannily similar to\nThe Only Ones and Shed Seven's Going for Gold makes a guest\nappearance at the beginning of The\nWanderers.\nCliche-free, inspiring and original,\nThe Hybirds may not be. Saviours\nof an apparently fading guitar rock\nband scene, they could well turn\nout to be. The triumphant I'm Coming Out feels like an emancipation from some form of imprisonment: be it mental, physical,\nsocial or emotional. The punk y24 makes you turn the stereo up and\npractice your best rhythm air guitar\nposes and this is what good rock\nmusic does. It hits you hard sometimes and it takes you away other\ntimes. It takes you away from the\nmundane routine. It lifts you above\nthe rubbish. It seems so simple\nthat it makes you wonder how\nsome bands lose the plot. The\nHybirds have the rock blueprint to\nsoar: grab a wing and prepare to\nfly. ra\nDennis\nwith the drummer and bongo player maniac ally killing their equipment with stamina to put any top\nclass marathon runner to shame.\nBizarrely, after this tort u rous finale, the crowd called for an\nencore. No prizes for guessing that\nthey never returned. Cornershop's present philosophy of 'fans, who\nneeds ' em' needs some radical\nchanging. H Jason\n\n"

    "content": "28 SPORT\nFootballers Win Some Games\nBut still no excuse to trash a hotel\nICUWAFC v St\nGEORGE'S Nine gluttons for punishment (6 of\nwhich were rather hungover)\narrived at Harlington bright and\nearly on Sunday morning after the\nrevelries of the night before\n(including the obscene sight of the\nDuke of Prague's manhood). We would have had a full team but one\nrandom preferred to have a long,\nhot bath while the other was unconscious in a pool of her own vomit. This match was crucial to\navoid relegation and also the last\never match of two former captains\n(Scrubber and Hacker), so much pride was at stake.\nSlack, Hungover, shit play saw\nus a goal down early on but, for\nthe first time ever, Hedge's desperate plea of \"Let's get one back\"\nproved effective as Scrubber slotted the ball home after a neat corner from the \"Golden Tamarin\".\nHood y proved to be a useless,\nhungover wreck, unable to run or\nsee efficiently and spent most of\nher time bitching about the opposition and her inability to score.\nThe first half ended21 up as Lili\nscored a beautiful solo effort,\navoiding the offside trap like a true\nprofessional.\nNewly crowned player of the\nyear \"Elhosh\" and next year's captain \"Greek Bird\" held the defence\nand midfield together well and\neventually Scrubber mono polis eda nice pass through to beat the\nkeeper 1 on 1. She completed her\nhat-trick a few moments later with\na stunning strike into the right\nhand corner.\nThe romp continued when another cool corner from the\nGolden Tamarin was met by\nScrubber - goal number four for\nher. We were shitting on the bitch-es. The game finished 6-1, when The Golden Tamarin scored an\nopportunistic poacher's goal from\nclose range.\nSo we avoided relegation by\nthe skin of our teeth for the second\nyear in a row. Well done for an\ninteresting and sometimes supersonic season. For those of us leaving at the end of June, it was an\nemotional end to our footballing\ncareers and I almost felt compelled to kiss the hallowed turf of\nHarlington (OK not quite.)\nICUWAFC 6 - St George's ICUAFC Iv LSE I It was third time lucky for the LSE\nas they deservedly won the UL U Challenge Cup. Their opponents\nImperial never got into the game,\nbut deserve credit for being the\nfirst Imperial side to reach the final\nin years. Indeed the final will provide them with vital experience as\nthey aim to go one better next sea-son.\nLSE dominated from the start\nand took the lead when Donal\nKeane failed to come out for a free-kick from the left, leaving the\nLSE midfielder with a free header.\nAmo and Stewart were out-fought\nin midfield, leaving the Imperial\nback four unprotected for large\nperiods of the game. Indeed this\nwas the case for LSE's second goal\nas their Greek striker, who later\nhad a bust-up with Foulstone,\nscored his fourth goal in four\ngames against\nImperial this season. Worse\nwas to follow as Keane was lobbed\nfrom 30 yards. Half-time and the\nfinal was virtually over. Surely the\ntime to make a few changes? No, as Psycho somehow kept faith\nwith the starting eleven even\nthough Tip pay a wong replaced\nShanidze shortly afterwards.\nImperial managed to raise their\ngame to some extent, but failed to\ntrouble the LSE goalkeeper who had the Man of The Match playing\ntight in front of\nhim. Indeed it remains a mystery why Imperial constantly aimed\nfor Marcos' head when LSE's central defender won absolutely\neverything in the air. LSE then got\ntheir fourth after they broke free\ndown Imperial's left hand side. No way back for IC who had substitute\nGalliardo carried off with a suspected broken leg late on.\nA day of joy for LSE, a day of\nmisery for Imperial. Key players\nsimply\ndidn't perform on the day, but\nspirits were lifted at the annual\nClub\nDinner after the game where\nWarren Brayn was named Player of\nThe Year, Foulstone was the DJ,\nShanidze was quiet and Psycho\nprovided the entertainment\".\nThe presence of Andy Heeps\nwas much appreciated and allayed\nrumours that no-one loves the\nfoot ie club.\nICUAFC 1 0 - 4 LSE I ICUAFC II v RFH\nWith a faint hope of the title, IC\nseconds needed a win against RFH\nwho had beaten them earlier in the\nseason. These wise guys needed a lesson. It was one of the toughest\nmatches of the season and also\none of our best performances.\nThird team ringer Andy Murphy played superbly at centre mid, adding some much needed weight\nto the midfield who got kicked\nabout in the last match. The first\nhalf was tight with few chances for\neither team, but Ricky Ham the\nsecond half of our third team combo was forced into a spectacular save to keep the scores level\nat half time.\nIn the second half our defence\ntook control with Rob and Andy\nlooking superb at the back. The\npressure on RFH grew and grew\nuntil Tony volleyed home in a crowded area to put us ahead. But\nas we pressed home for the sec-on d, RFH broke in their first attack\nof the whole half and slotted the\nball into the net. With our title\nchallenge slipping away before our\neyes, we went mental and threw\neverything at them. They held on\nuntil the final 100 seconds when, with everyone waiting for the w his tle, a deep cross from Tony met\nSiat who volleyed the ball past the\nkeeper and won the match for IC.\nICUAFC II 2 I RFH\nResults\nCamborne\nRS M HC10 Camborne\nRS MWH C02 Camborne\nRSMFC 2 - 4 Camborne\nRSMRFC 26 - 0 Camborne\nSkiing\nICUSC I3 rd ICUSC II 14th ICUICXWSC 2nd Hoc key\nICUHC II 6 - I Kings\nICU HC III 15 - 0 St Bart's Rugby\nM RFC13120U MDS RFC IMRFC II 21 - 13 UMD S RFCS MH RFC343 CXWRFC\nIMWRFC 1 5 - 1 0 UMD S RFC Football\nICUAFC I04 LSE I ICUAFC II 0 - 1 Q MW111 ICUAFC III 0 - 1 LSE IV\n13 March1998 Editorial\nHullo my Brethren.\nHeavens to Murgatroid! We have\nbeen busy of late. Many of our athletes have been performing sporting\nacts that border on the Herculean in\ntheir enormity. So multitudinous\nand diverse have your achievements been that 1 regret that my\nwoefully inadequate pages have\nbeen unable to cope with your\nreports so a number of them had to\nbe edited to the point of non-existence. Do not think that I held your\nreports in any less esteem (even In\nthe cases where I did). Suffice to\nsay that with every word of your\narticles that I edit, a little piece of\nme seems to die. I apologise also\nfor the absence of previously\nneglected articles. This is due to the\ninfluence of that despicable ne'er-do-well Bill Gates and his Insidious\ncomputer programs.\nOn another subject altogether,\nit saddens me to see that the football team's good humour ed high\nspirits have again caused them to\nbe thrust centre stage. This is obviously none of my business so I will\ncomment upon it no further. Except\nto say this. I myself have been on\nthe receiving end of the wrath\nmeted out by hotel officials. I will\nnot dwell on the details of that sordid affair, not the night of hell to\nwhich the petty despots of the\nMetropolitan police subjected me.\nhowever what 1 did learn from this\nlamentable ordeal is this: Hoteliers\nhave a tendency to blow these\nthings out of proportion (whether\nor not for their own perverse satisfaction I will not speculate) and so\none should not necessarily attach\ntoo much credence to the reports\none hears.\nIf the football team wish to prevent an occurrence of this unfortunate episode, I can but commend to them the advice of my esteemed\ncollaborator David. This diminutive\nFrenchman suggested that the\nmembers of the football club (and\nIndeed all Imperial athletes) should\nbecome straight-edge punks.\nUnderstandably per-plex ed,I inquired as to the mean-ing of this\nphrase. He explained that straight\nedge punks, amongst who's number he counts himself, are punks\nwho shun alcohol and indeed drugs\nof all description. It seems a bizarre\nnotion and one to which 1 certainly\nshall not Incline myself. However\nit's certainly something to think\nabout.\nDrop the bomb exterminate\nthem all.\nJacob\n\n"

    "content": "14 MUSIC 13 March 1998\nTHA BOMBI\nRIP BIGGIE SMALLS aka NOTORIOUS BIG aka CHRISTOPHER WALLACE\nIt's been almost a year since the death of Biggie\nSmalls, aka Christopher Wallace. After the loss\nof Tupac Shakur, Biggie's death \u2022 ^ \u2022 \u2022 HH HH BH was the last thing hiphop^^ \u2022^SS^fl^ff\nneeded. Most people thought| MB BBBB Br?f e^ it was some sort of revenge for\n2Pac, truth is, we will never ^ j lMP i know the true reasons for the Wv BS deaths of either rap stars.\nBiggie's death was described j w ij^jj ff j l by many as the end of an era,\nbut Puffy has managed to keep gI B the Biggie thang going even |\u00a7|||'\nthough the big man is a few 9mmm^. feet under. The question u have to ask is has hip\nhop gone anywhere - the answer is no. The\nworld has gone sampling mad, Puffy and his\nsampler rule, is Puffy hip hop or just pop, who knows? Make ya own mind up.\nOn a single tip I gotta mention the return of\nthe original first lady of soul Aretha Franklin,\nshe's been out of circulation for a while but now she's back with A Rose is Still A Rose. The production and writing both come from Ms Lauryn\nHill (from The Fugees) and she works her magic\nto perfection to bring us this wicked tune.\nRelease date for the album is still to be\nannounced. Talking about release dates, the\nRedman joint has been put back, this woz suppose to get a release at the backend of last year,\nbut no.I 've been waiting for this since 1 hear\nRoni Size is doing some of the production, that's right heavy, heavy beats.\nSnoop Doggy Dogg has his own record label\nnow, although Iam not sure what is going on as\nhe still has a contract with Death Row Records\nto produce around 5 more albums. Snoop\nappears on the Caught Up soundtrack reunited\nwith ex-Dogg Pound rapper Kurupt, and appears\ncourtesy of his Dogg House Records.\nI have heard there is a mix-tape going\naround in Philadelphia entitled Makaveli 2 and\ncontains many unreleased 2Pac songs. Death\nRow confirmed they are his songs and most of\nthem are likely to appear on the upcoming Outlawz Immortalz album, due out on Death\nRow.\nOutlawz Immortalz member Fatal Hussein,\ncousin of Tupac, will release his album, and so Phat Selection\nToo Close - Next\nWicked track from the album Rated Next\nRoyalty - Gang Starr feat K Ci 8>. Jojo\nGuru and Premier do their normal high class\nthing whilst Jodeci boys K Ci and Jojo hook up\nfor the R&B bit\nWho Am I Beenie Man\nTune, people be going mad for this on the\nfloor and even in the charts\nHow Can I Get Over You (remix)- Taral\nFunked up version utilising Total's' NoOne Else' and Luniz 'I got 5 On It', a definite floor\nfiller. Oh, did I mention LL helps out too?\nfar it sounds like he ain't all about Thug Life and\nhas some introspective songs with a wide range\nJMUUUMJM^ of subject matter. The tracks\n\u00ab\u2022:' <\nHfaj- are supposed to be bang in'. Speaking of Death Row, they have been dropped by\nInterscope due to pressure\n\u2022V'..$! IWfr)fc. \u2022 from 50% stake holder Seagram.\nH[[*l NW PB Wy Seagram claimed that Death\nmm Row were providing a bad in flu mB ken ce to children with 'gangsta\nrap'. This coming from a comP* Kp any that produce alcohol!\n* * Suger Knight, the incarcerated\nCEO of Death Row Records, said that they will\nsign a project-by-project distribution deal with a major distribution company. There are rumours,\nthough, that with all of the legal troubles of\nDeath Row, Suge Knight will form a new comp any but it should be business as usual.\nMore Tupac news... apparently Afeni Shakur,\nhis mother, has dropped the case against Death\nRow Records after over 100 of his unreleased\nsongs were given over to her. Also, Tupac's father was suing his estate for half his money but\nthe case was thrown out as he had hardly been\nin 'Pac's life and only contributed around $ 2 0\nhis whole life!!! Greedy huh? Check this out for\ngreedy... C. Delores Tucker, forever campaigning against g nags ta rap, was suing Tupac's estate for damages to her sex life after the songs\nHow Do You Want It and Wonda Why They Call\nU Bytch. The former contains the rhyme ' C. Delores Tucker you a motherfucker/Instead of\ntrying to help a nigga you destroy a broth a'. The\nother song is actually telling a young girl who is\nselling her body to give it up and go to school\nand make something of herself.\nMilen &. Roni\nClass i1 to um Jnttr VA At il - Boy/ II Men\nTrie story goes a little .sum tin' like this : in the\nearly nineties, four guys from Phiily decided to get together and voila, we have the multi-plat'\u2022 ii I1\n.i group Boyz li Men. Their dod gy afro's and preppie clothes may not appeal to all but one things for sure, they can sing....and\nsing real weil too as demonstrated on this, their\nsophomore set, released in 1994.\nCollaborations with the likes of Dallas\nAustin, jimmy jam &. Terry Lewis and the production master Babyface led to four hit singles\n- the ballads I 'll Make Love to You (the biggest\nselling single in America of ali time). Water\nRuns Dry and On Bended Knee as well as the\nspunky Thank You. Virtually every cut on the on\nthe al burn has quality written all over it, notably\nVlbin' and the Brain McKnight penned Tallin'.\nTight melodies, incredible harmonies, (check\nthe ac cape ii a Yesterday if you disagree).\nShawn, Nate, Wanya and Michael are clearly\nthe best R'n' B group out there. Accept no\nwatered down substitutes this is the real deal,\ny 'all. Gloria\n,.' of Ii; LAY A LL Cool J film\nLL Cool J is possibly the most recognised rap artist in the world today, at the\nage of 2 8 his list of accomplishments seem\ntoo long for one so young:2 time Grammy\naward winner, six consecutive platinum\nselling albums, star of hit television show,\nactor, author, father and husband. Some\ncall him the undisputed king of hip-hop, maybe\nthat's a little too much, but he's certainly a hiphop sensation. LL is doin' it and doin' it and\ndoin' it well.\nLL was born James Todd Smith, but before\nlong he had created his own stage name LL Cool\nJ, and acronym for \"Ladies Love Cool James\". At\n9 he was rapping and at 13 had already produced numerous demos, he sent off tape after\ntape in hope of a recording contract, the only\nlabel to\nrespond was the\nthen tiny\nDef Jam.\nLL hit the\nscene in\n1984, at\nthe age\nof 16 he\nwas the\nfirst artist\nto release a single on the now legendary label\nDef Jam, / Need A Beat. The following year saw\nhim release his first album, described by the critics as the most original album of the time Radio.\nSuddenly LL was thrust into the public eye and\nthe following summer he went on tour with the\nbiggest rappers, Run DMC. His second set took\na while to hit the streets but Bigger and Deffer\ndidn't disappoint, at the same time he also\ndelivered the hit single / Need Your Love. LL's profile was large. LL's1989 album Walking With\na Panther was considered by most as the worst\nthing he had ever done and there was talk that\nLL had lost it. This talk was quickly dismissed\nwith his next album when he got together with\nMarley Marl for the hugely successful Mama\nSaid Knock You Out, this set re-established LL in\nthe hip hop world. Mama Said., featured the\nwicked Around The Way Girl, a top ten smash,\nLL won his first Grammy for Best Rap Solo. 1993\nsaw the release of 14 Shots to the Dome, this\nwas real weak in comparison to his previous\neffort, but still reached platinum, to make it five\nin a row for him. Next up was Mr Smith, this featured the classic Hey Lover, this song featured\nthe vocal styling of R& JB group Boyz II Men. Hey\nLover ended up being one of the biggest tunes\nLL had ever made and also gave him his second\nGrammy award. Along with Hey .. the\nalbum also featured Doin' It and Loungin',\nall these went to making Mr Smith LL's biggest selling album to date. LL's latest\noffering is Phenomenon this is not in the\nclass of Mr Smith, but LL has high hopes for\nthe singles after they get the remix treat-ment. Milen\n\n"

    "content": "Sjgf 4\nLETTERS 13 March 1998\nLetters to Felix. CASH QUESTIONS\nDear Felix\nSince becoming Acting Honarary\nJunior Treasurer of City and Guilds\nCollege Union recently, several\nthings have come to my attention,\nmost of which are related to the\n\"fund with no name.\"\nIt appears that the reason why\nthe CCUs are failing to provide the\nservice expected of them, is not just\ndue to poor union officers, but also\ndue to a lack of funding from ICU.\nIn the last few years C&. GU has\nlost several thousand pounds of self\ngenerated income and five year plan\nmoney to the \"fund with no name.\"\nThis is only significant when I explain what these funds could have\nbeen used for.\nSelf generated income is the\nonly money that can be used for\nsocial activities under ICU Finance\nrules. This means that several thousand pounds that could have been\nused to run bar nights and sub sidi seC& C dinners, etc. has been taken by\nICU from C& GU and placed in the\n\"fund with no name.\"\nFive year plan money is the\nmoney that could have been used\nto refurbish the C&. GU office and\nbuy new computers for use by the\nC& GU clubs / societies.\nThis is just the start of what\nappears to be a trend of moving the\nmoney from the CC Us to ICU.\nIf this trend continues as it\nseems sure to do, then the CC Us will cease to operate altogether.\nI hear rumours now that ICU\nwants to move the sale of regalia\nfrom C& GU to the ICU shop, reducing the income of C& GU again. This\nis a direct parallel with the way ICU\nlost its bookshop last year.\nIf the funding crisis of the CCUs is\nnot ended soon, then it looks more\nand more likely that the CCUs will\nhave to unite and fight against ICU.\nIf the CCUs act together, they\nhave the majority vote on ICU\nCouncil and can overthrow any more\nstupid plans that the anti-CCU megalomaniacs on council may have.\nThe new exec will have a tough\njob to try to rebuild C& GU, but if ICU\nwill help them, especially financially,\nthey can start making C& GU work\nfor the student population again.\nPlease visit the C& GU office on\nlevel 3 of Me ch Eng occasionally.\nYours camp a in ingly John Quantrell\nj. quant re ll@ ic.ac.uk\nYou complain of ICU 'removing\nfunds' from the C&. GU. As far as I am aware, funds are only\nreturned to ICU at the end of the\nyear, as with all clubs. The Union\noperates a budget system, whereby you submit an application for\ncash before the year starts, stating how much money you want\nand what it is to be spent on.\nSubject to approval, this is what\nyou will receive. If you don't need\nall of the money, it is naturally\nreturned to ICU at the end of the\nyear. More money may be claimed\nfrom the Union's Finance Council,\nwho are quite happy to fund justified applications.\nUnion money may be spent on\nsocial events, but cannot be used\nto buy food or alcohol. This is not\nbecause the Union is mean, but\nbecause it is illegal. Only money\nthat is earned by the club itself\n(self-generated income) used.\nHowever, you should realise that\nSGI is still union money and as\nsuch is subject to the usual tot-ting-up at the end of the year. If\nyour SGI forms a large part of\nyour total income, there may be a case to set up a reserve account\nto keep hold of it, but this is generally only applicable if it actually exceeds the Union grant.\nYou concerns over regalia are\nalso unfounded. While ICU are\nplanning to sell the ties, scarves\netc from the shop, they are doing\nso with the co-operation of the\nCCUs, who were unable to sell\nthem effectively. Furthermore,\nthey were not making any money\non the sales, do ICU is really\ndoing them a financial favour.\nIf C& GU are not able to fund\nthe projects they require, it is\nalmost certainly due to bad budgeting and financial incompetence, and certainly not some\nunion conspiracy. 1 hope you will\nlook into these matters more\ncarefully before making a fuss at\nICU Council. C& GU have enough\nproblems at the moment, without one of their exec making a tit\nof himself at Council. Ed\nERR... WHAT?\nDear Felix\nI think you goat and Bollocks,\nmusic bad Bugger off Bastards\nlots of love\nRocSoc\nTHA BOMB!\nDear Felix,\nIam an Indian and like many of\nmy brown/black friends, I'm into\nblack music (soul, swing, hip hop\netc). The problem with IC is that\nthere aren't many nights dedicated\nto our kind of music so we end up\nhaving to go to clubs to enjoy it.\nThis ends up costing quite a bit,\nespecially since we go out so\nmuch! We went to the OS C Welcome night last term and 1 have\nto say, it was really shit. So when we saw the advert for Tha Bomb in\nFelix, we thought it would be pretty crap but decided to go and\ncheck it out anyway. I even called\nsome friends down from Reading\nUniversity.\nI have to admit that the night\nwas bloody brilliant, especially as it\nonly cost \u00a31 to get in. The music\nwas great, the drinks were great,\nthere were even great cocktails\n(which we don't even get at the\nclubs), the UD H was packed! I was\nvery impressed, the two fire alarms\ndid piss me off though.\nWhy has it taken you so long to\nwork out that you CAN make Friday\nnights at the Union enjoyable for\npeople like me and my friends. I told my friends from Reading that\nthis sort of thing happened all the\ntime, and I think it should. What\nwould be out of this world would\nbe if you could use the whole of\nthe building, including dBs, every\nso often. Tell other London Unis\nabout the music, the cocktails etc.\nIam so sure you can make this into\nsomething really big, so please can\nyou try to make this a regular\noccur ance and give us something\nabout our Union that we can boast\nabout: Tha atom Bomb!\nDarshan Arun EE1\nHOME SWEET\nHOME Dear Y. L.I was really touched by your letter to Felix [1 109, 27 February]. 1\ndon't really understand any references to dogs in the ac com mod ation office. (But then 1 intent to\nleave my name on this letter.)\nYou made me realise it was\nabout time I got off my bum and\nintroduced myself, so here Iam.

This is the largest\namount allocated to any university\nin the country, according to the\nTimes Higher Education\nSupplement. The figure is made up\nof money from the Higher\nEducation Funding Council for\nEngland, as well as the college's generic income from joint projects\nwith industry. The amount is a5.1% increase on last year and places\nImperial above Cambridge and Oxford, who were rewarded \u00a3 9 0\nand \u00a3 8 4 million respectively.\nThe 1998-99 allocations are the\nresult of a research assessment\nexercise carried out in 1996. This\nassessment was also used to assign\nlast year's funding levels, but\nImperial received less as some of its\ngrant was used to support those\nwho performed badly in the assess-ment. This time Imperial has\nretained its full award, leaving the\nHEFCE to pay the aid bill. The\nassessment procedure, which is still\nunder development; considers a wide range of factors and allots\nthem a relative weight.\nAll universities have received an\nincrease on last year's awards in\ncash terms, but the high flyers have\nUNIVERSITY FUNDING 1998 99\n' \u2022 :;\ni!':.i.

According to\nthe finance department \u00a3 1 70 million is a more accurate estimation\nof IC's research funding, but the\nincrease on last year is apparently\nonly slightly above inflation, with\none department source stating \"we\ndon't think we're that much better\noff than last year\". The amount\nincludes revenue from tuition fees,\nwhich \"causes us some concern\".\nIt is felt that the college is in a slightly more vulnerable position\nthan last year, as the funding is the\nsource of academic staffs' salaries,\nand difficulties with the collection\nof student fees could strain college\nresources.\nOn a national scale academic\nstaff are exposed in having to rely\nso heavily on student fees. David\nTriesman, General Secretary of the\nAssociation of University Teachers,\nwas far from contented with\nGovernment spending; \"The universities are hanging on- by their finger\nnails. We recognise a serious effort\nis being made to inject stability, but\nit remains a constant problem while\nall the big policy decisions for higher education are on ice.\"\nCollege Steal STA Deal\nDAVID ROBERTS\nThe Union has found itself \u00a3 4 2 , 0 0 0\nper year worse off this week as a result of a move from College\nwhich has been described by\none senior source as \"black-mail\". College has demanded a70% share of the proceeds generated from the space rented to\nSTA Travel, which at present\ngoes directly into Union fund-ing. If the Union do not accept I this deal then the Rector, Sir I Ronald Oxburgh, has stated that I the planned j CR development 111\nwill not go ahead. f The edict from Sir Ron comes\nshortly after College attempted\nto force the Union to pay \u00a3 100,000\nfor the desperately needed re nova tion, and thus some see the move\non top of last year's loss of the\nUnion Bookstore and recent\nattempts by its successor,\nWaterstone's, to take over the sta-Photo: Mark Smith\ntio nary and card trade on campus,\nsenior figures view this as the next\nstep in the Rector's master-plan to\nas being purely cash-driven.

This gave the Lilys limited success in the singles chart with one of\nthe lowest charting\nLevis songs ever, following the likes of\nBoombastic, Inside and\nSpaceman all former\nnumber ones. The Lilys\nhave now completed an album, but can it\ncompete with the quality of their previous sin-gle?An d are they as fifties as all\nthat?\nThe album has been made purely to recreate the fifties as\nmuch as possible. Hours of editing\ntime was spent trying to recreate\nall of the 'zestful tangents and\nquirky swoons and squeaks' of the\nera. It is all very impressive in\nterms of how well this is achieved,\nbut after the first few songs, it\nbecomes incredibly annoying. You\nspend almost the whole time ,\nwhile listening to the album just\nwanting them to snap out of it and\nto get with the times.\nThe Lilys have seemed to have\ntaken a completely normal set of\ntunes, which don't seem to have\nany plan to them in terms of dire c tion, start or finish and\nthen just put in a lot of\nsickly harmonies and weird bits and have hoped\nthat the because it is so\nreminiscent everyone will\njump on the band wagon,\nforgetting that to do this\nthere must be some talent\nthere. It's almost as if the\nbeach boys were singing\nbaba black sheep in a American singing the National\nAnthem for five minutes trying to\nget as many extra notes in as possible type way and it doesn't work.\nThis album has been greeted\narms wide open by the Maker and\nNME, but unless you are a fifties\nkid, from that great era that no-one\nraves about or even talks about\nmusically stay away.CI\nDavid HT his collection of live tracks,\nout-takes and classic tracks\nwas released last December.\nDue to popular demand, it was relaunched about a month ago and is\njust about one of the most comprehensive and well-made boxed\nsets ever. It really does justice to\nthe band whose career was cut\nshort tragically when their lead\nsinger, Ian Curtis, committed sui-cide. The band formed in 1977 as\na result of the punk explosion but\nthey didn't create thrash y guitar\nnoise like the Sex Pistols or the\nBuzzcocks; instead they made a kind of moody, bass-led drone that\nreflected their goth tendencies and\nwould go on to influence a multitude of bands . Singer Ian Curtis'\nlyrics were depressing and sung\nwith a kind of mo not pony that\nwould normally have been boring -he, however, made them worth listening to.\nHeart and Soul contains\nextended versions of two of their\nstudio albums, Unexpected Pleasures and Closer as well as aCD of rarities and out-takes and a fourth CD of live recordings. The\nfirst two of these are an interesting\nset of records. Unexpected\nPleasures was initially released in\n1979 and was a defining moment\nin the band's history and some\nwould say that it was their best\nalbum. It could be said that adding\nnew tracks to a classic album\nwould make it worse because it\ncontains those tracks that the band\nnever wanted on it. The counter-argument is that, as a listener or\nfan, this set of new songs extends\nthe journey that Heart and Soul\ntakes you on. Closer Plus carries on adding\nnew tracks and contains the song\nthat everyone, whether or not they\nhave heard any other Joy Division\ntracks, has heard Love Will Tear Us\nApart. The Rarities CD shows the\nbiggest transformation, though.\nHere, it is obvious to see how the\nband developed from their early\npunk side to late gothic, while the\nlive CD is a testament to Ian Curtis'\ntalent. In such a small space, it is\ndifficult to say much more about an\nalbum that deserves to be in any\nself-respecting music fan's colle c tion. Get it. Tell your friends to get\nit. Get it. Get it? C! Alok\nSINGLES Pulp - This Is Hardcore\nIf they're trying to shed their Common People\nsound, they've done an amazingly convincing\njob of it. Sleaziness is the key here, plus an\nattempt at epic-ness without quite managing to\npull it off. Even if you didn't rate Common People, you'll be hard pressed to reckon this is\nmuch cop.\nJAsON' S ESSENTIAL CHOON Bernard Butler - Not Alone\nCan you remember the epitome of poppi ness and class that is Yes, which had Bernard partnered with M cAl mont. This track is nearly up\nthere in the same category of quality. It is both\nuplifting and intensely catchy, and it promises\nmuch for his forthcoming album.\nTherapy? - Church of Noise\nThis is a change from what you would normally\nexpect to hear from Therapy. It is quite quirky\nand much more poppy than their usual heavy\nthrash (Teethgrinder), and it's not a distorted\nguitar headlong rush common to their last\nalbum. A very disappointing comeback release.\nWillliam - Tired of Fucking\nWhat a load of trash. This sounds like the former\nJesus &. Mary Chain member William Reid has\njust gone into a studio and started strumming\nhis guitar. If you want to know what lo-fi is, just\ngive this a listen. Any fans of the J8JV1 Chain who might get this record, get it for the B sides\nwhich are only slightly better.\nPortishead - Only You\nTypically Portishead, but lacking any real hook-line to reel the listener in. Depressing as expected but there is nothing exciting happening here,\nunlike previous releases such as Glory Box.\nJason\nBlack Crape - Marbles\nNo one's really sure whether Black Grape still\nexist or not. One thing's for certain, songs from\ntheir latest album lack the same drug-addled\nlunacy of It's Great When You're Straight, Yeah!\nMarbles is good though, saved from the asylum\nby the hyper-bollocks line, 'I know you swapped\na kidney for a stone / Well I saw you swap a kidney for a 'phone.'\nRadiator - Resistor\nYou're first hit by the pounding backing section\nwhose beats are so rhythmic they could almost\nhave been recorded backwards. Then it's a constant battle between a scary voice repeatedly\nshouting the words 'Arise' and 'Resistor' like\nsome kind of futuristic dictator; and a heartfelt\nmelody of 'I 've been so aroused'. Gets you j iv ing.\nStreem - Coming Down\nClearly influenced by both Bowie and Republica\n(and even Monaco in places), Streem are on a journey to the Moon. So they might as well\nmake some pleasing music on the way. Beware:\non occasions they sound a bit like mainstay ers Babylon Zoo. But don't let that put you off.\n| ED'S ESSENTIAL CHOON Mainstream - Step Right Up\nRecent Nude signings Mainstream probably\nchose their name as an escape clause, in case\nthey ever got called unoriginal. Don't worry\nthough. This song is amazing. OK, so the voice\nis classic Tim Burgess with a sprinkling of Ian\nBrown. Alright, the chorus is Happy Mondays esque with its jump able 'Step Right Up, c'm on now, Step Right Up' refrain. And, agreed, the\nsound is Baggy with not-out-of-place flute flour-is he s. The fact remains. You'll love it!\nGlamourous Hooligan - Stoned Island Estate\nAn uplifting mixture of big beat and political reggae with an old style 'happy hardcore' pulse\nrunning through it. The lyricist obvious;y feels\npassionately about his subject but there seems\nto be lacking in this song, which would probably\nsound best whilst clubbing. CI\nEd\n\n"

    "content": "16 MUSIC 3 March 1998\nCLUBSCENE - COMPILATIONS\nthe e he et nec a fie Hello and welcome to another edition of the\nElectric Cafe. Hope you're all doing well. Hot on\nthe heels of the MrC interview last week, look\nout for forthcoming features on the stars of\nGerman electronic music, including interviews\nwith Fauna Flash, who have been creating\nShockwaves on the international drum'n 'bass\nscene; Michael Reinboth, who owns Germany's coolest experimental electronic/jazz label\nCompost Records and also DJs regularly at\nvenues such as the Blue Note in London; and\nalso Ingmar Koch from Air Liquide, who have\nproduced some of my finest techno moments\nand also command lots of respect in the underground scene.\nFirstly, I wanted to thank everyone who came down to the first ever Electric Cafe music\nnight a couple of Thursdays ago. It really was an\nevent that transformed Southside disco. The\natmosphere was very friendly and relaxed. I think the concept of making it into another\ndrinking area where you can chill out and chat\nto people worked really well. I played from 7 pm to 1 1 pm, and a whole range of musical styles\nwere covered.\nIf you couldn't make it to the last one, we\nare going to make these a regular feature at\nSouthside. The next one will be on Thursday\n19th March( in less than a week).\nYou may remember that 1 was talking about\na club called Analog City in my column a couple\nof weeks ago. It actually took place last weekend on Saturday 7th March at The Camden Island Market. I was lucky enough to be able to\ncheck out the event for myself. After taking a lot\nof stick, techno has been going through a bad\npatch lately. DJ Craig Thomas and his friends\ndecided to put on this event to prove once and\nfor all that techno is not dead, and is as musically significant as any other style present today.\nFirst of all, I have to say that I was really\nimpressed with the venue. The Camden Island\nMarket is very clean and spacious. The design\nand layout was interesting as both dance floors\nare connected and you have to pass through\non re to get to the other. Somehow this wasn'ta problem and I never felt jostled or cramped. It\ncould have been nice to have a better chill-ou it area, but that is just a minor niggle!\nArriving soon after midnight, I found the\nplace was still warming up. This was going to be\na long night! The concept of the club was to get\nas many DJs as possible to play for a set amount\nof time. The idea was to keep a varied and fresh\nsound throughout the night. 1 think that this\nworked. I thought beforehand that an hour-long\nset would be too short for many DJs, but 1 do respect Craig for trying a new concept that goes\nagainst the grain. Giving each DJ a deadline to\nspark off the crowd led to a sense of urgency in\nmany sets. There were no long build-ups, each\nspinner got straight to the point and really let\nthe music do the talking.\nTwo rooms were pumping out the grooves\nall night. The back room was the perfect setting\nfor complete techno mayhem. Very minimal and\nrhythmic. The setting was dark and smokey. The\nmusic was good if you like hard techno. James\nRuskin did an admirable job, pounding the\ncrowd into a frenzy. However, player of the\nnight in the main room had to be Craig Thomas.\nThis was his night, and I was in awe of his set.\nIt was by far the funkiest thing to hit that room all night, yet it didn't compromise the atmosphere or loose the crowd at all.\nThe music represented in the other room was the housie r side of techno. Some very\nrhythmic and groovy tracks kept a very friendly\ncrowd smiling all night. All the DJs played really expressive, quality sets of music; none more-so than Mark Dale. Mark is the brother of one of\nmy musical heroes, Colin Dale and is also a very\nhighly respected DJ. I have seen him play twice\nat now. Once was on the main floor of The End\nat an old Deep Space party where he played\nhard and had the crowd screaming for more.\nThis weekend he played a very different set that\nhad the same effect! Techno DJs aren't versa-tile? I don't think so!\nAll in all, everyone I came into contact with\nhad a great night out so well done to Analog\nCity\\ If you missed out this time round then you\ncan catch it every month at the Camden Island\nMarket. The Electric Cafe will be running future\ncompetitions so you can get in for free!\nWe're running three competitions for free\nCDs! The first one is for a copy of the latest\nalbum on React Records, and the latest chapter\nin the Dope on Plastic Series. This features the\nbest in blunted beats, downbeat funk and hip-hop. Don't miss out! Here's the question.\nDope on Plastic Five was mixed by DJ |oh n Stapleton from Bristol. Which famous\nBristolian drum'n 'bass artist recently\nreceived a Mercury Music Award for his work\nwith Reprazent?\nThe second giveaway is a new CD from 80's pop icon Gary Num an. His by now an the mic Cars and tracks such as Films and Are 'Friends'\nElectric? made him into a household name.\nNow these tracks are back, but in a new shape\nand form.

This mix is completely representative of his style and features the work of\nartists such as DJ Sneak, Mood II Swing, Kevin\nYost and Mike Huckaby. I really do rate this mix,\nso grab you chance to win a copy.\nName the Parisian dance outfit who\nstormed the Pop charts with last year's Homework album and a spate of singles\nincluding Da Funk.\nAnswers to all competitions by email to\na. seth i@ ic.ac.uk.\nHave a great week! See you on Thursday at\nSouthside!\nal x k. CLUBSCENE - CLUB REVIEW.\nIT'S A LONDON THING I No.4 Club, Bishops Hall, Kingston.\nT his is Scott Garcia's new and\nonly London residence, every\nFriday you can catch the man\ndropping the choicest cuts of\nunderground/\"speed\" garage.\nKingston is a little out of town but when I spoke to Scott he\nexplained that they wanted to get\nout of the centre of town as there is\nto much attitude, you get a better\nvibe out of town. I have to agree\nwith him after attending the night a few weeks back. The lack of a dress\ncode might also be something to\ndo with it, you can just chill in ya\njeans and trainers.\nNo.4 Club was bigger than 1\nexpected and the de cot, you wouldn't call classy. But this just\nadds to the underground feel 'n' vibe this club has. There are plenty\nof classy joints in town if you want\nwhat sort of thing. But few with a true underground feel, it reminded\nme of the sort of warehouse raves\nof years gone by.\nThere's an adequate lighting rig,\na booming sound system, plenty of\nseating and places to get away\nfrom it all and chill, quite a few bars\nand they were well staffed, but it\nstill took ages to get a drink I and\nthere is even a cafe in their what\nmore could you want.\nWe got down there just in time\nto catch Scott &. Mc Styles doing\ntheir thing and they didn'tdi sap point, showing that he is not just a big name producer that puts his\nname to a club, he is a shit hot Dj\nin his own right. And with guest DJs\nsuch as Norris Da Boss Windross\nthis week, this is fast becoming a night not to be missed.\nWhen I was speaking to Scott,\nhe told me, \"what we have done is\nmake it like a club where 1 would\nwant to go, and were getting their\nit's got the vibe, it just needs the\ntrimmings\" and it's not as if he is\nlacking in experience after promoting the SW1 club for a year.\nSo this is well worth a little trek\nout of town to experience the true\nflavour of underground /speed\ngarage. jo Public\n\n"

    "content": "13 March 1998 ARTS 21\nYOU CAN LEAD A WHORE TO CULTURE, BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE HER THINK\nALAN DAVIESThe Duchess Theatre\nAlthough Alan Davies' West\nEnd Tour for 1998, \"Urban\nTrauma\" sold out on the first\nnight, his PR people guaranteed\nthat he would be back in the future.\nThe man has travelled around, which you can tell from the theme\nthat pervades his comedy routine.\nThe small, yet packed, theatre held\nan audience that seemed to expect\nthis; many of them appeared to\nanticipate his jokes and shouted\nout one liners in the middle of the\nperformance in an attempt to interact with him. After a while, some of\nthe audience became irritating, but,\nwith some effort, could be ignored.\nDavies himself was confident\nbehind the microphone, although\nLIVE\nhe constantly paused to take\nmental breathers by repeating\nearlier-introduced sound effects\nand performing silly dance routines\nacross the stage.\nThe crowd came prepared to\nlaugh, and did so after every joke\n(or attempted joke), even when the\ncomedian's remarks weren't particularly funny. As seems to be\ncommon with many stand up comedians, Davies focused on a particular topic and then continue ly lapsed off into tangent after\ntangent, only to return to his original topics suddenly, sometimes\nmuch later in the performance.\nThis forced me to stay focused on\nDavies' words at the risk of be co ming completely lost. Most of his\nroutine consisted of pointing out\nthe little-noticed ironies that occur\nin every aspect of normal, everyday\nlife. From the Olympics to mad cow disease to the potential evil\nplots of household cats and to the\ngenetic engineering of a mouse\nwith a human ear, Davies attempts\nto make us step back for a moment to ask, \" Why are we doing this?\"\nHe points out the ironies that we think about every day, but never\nactually take the time to concentrate on or wonder about what\ncould be going on behind the\nscenes. Davies' world is one of\nconspirators and skeptics, and he\ndoes a good job of pointing out\nthat we are all one of the two.\nSo if you are a fan of comedy,\nand are in the mood for a relaxing\nnight out, find out where Alan\nDavies is performing. Try to be in a somewhat focused mood, as his\nstring of jokes are often hard to\nfollow, especially since he usually\njust jumps into new topics without\nintroducing them. Watching Davies\nis definitely two hours well spent,\nbut if you ask whether or not he's worth the hefty price tag of a West\nEnd performance, my answer,\n\"perhaps not.\" It would probably\nbe just as good to watch him on\ntelevision or video.\nPhillip Reich\nSILLY COW\nThe Grace Theatre\nTrying to put the words eight-ies, relevant and good in the\nsame review is difficult, but\ntrying to make them work on a stage takes something a little bit\nmore special. This production at\nthe Grace manages to handle this\nproblem extremely well by complimenting delightful performances\nwith a marvellous script to produce\na highly entertaining and enjoyable\nshow. It's strange that the highlighted subject of the play, the\nmoral void of journalistic integrity,\ncan still find a common place\nwithin our society and news - it\nhelps us to appreciate some of the\nhumour and references when they\ntalk of situations we knew of only\nas children.\nThe atmosphere looks, feels\nand smells of the eighties, as we witness the day of super bitch critic\nDoris as she is being taken to court\nfor her previous remarks about an\nactress - something she is quite\nprone to doing. Milling around her\nare the, maybe slightly overdone,\ncharacters of her moralistic PA,\nslimy and loathsome 'soon to be'\nboss, ner dish accountant, and her\n\"trippin' an' rav in' all nigh'\" toy boy\n(a truly wonderful portrayal of men\nin their most annoying state). They\nmuddle around her, complimenting\nand flattering her before she heads\noff to court, and by the end of the\nfirst act we've been led pleasantly\nto the conclusion of the case, with\nmoments of amusement and\nabsurdity.\nI have to admit that during the\ninterval I wondered where the plot\nmight be going, as it certainly didn't look too promising, and the characters all seemed to be a little to\nmuch at that point. However, any\ndoubts 1 may have had were\ndispelled early in the second half as\nthe script, actors and play took on\na whole new path. It twisted, turned, delighted and enthralled at\nsuch a pace there were times when\nit was hard to get a breath in\nbetween laughing. Wonderful Ben\nElton, and full justice done to it\nAlthough this is the smallest of\nthe venues they have been to\n(having performed already in\nBristol, Edinburgh and Dublin) the\nlimited space presented no problems to the actors as they filled the\ntheatre with their lively and charismatic personalities and bought\nhome the excesses of life in the\nera. It has to be said that Charlotte\nFranklin who not only played Doris,\nbut also helped to produce the play\nobviously managed to juggle the\ntwo roles extremely well.\nIn a venue that should appeal\nto students in so many ways (it's above a good pub, it's on bus\nroutes from college, there's concession tickets available as well\nas tickets which include dinner) and\nwith such a well known playwright,\nit should make going to see this\nperformance even more enjoyable.\nIf you don't like Ben Elton you\nmight find you enjoy this, if you do like Ben Elton I think you'll love it.\nMatt Williams\nMore information on diary pages\nPHOTOSOC EXHIBITION PREVIEW\nThe Ante Room Gallery\nF rom the portrayal of a captivated audience of the humorous street performers in\nCovent Garden to the abstract\ncolour saturated shot of the\nGuggenheim Museum in Spain, this\nexhibition reflects something of\neach individual photographer.\nThese, and around 50 other\nphotographs will be on display at\nthe 1998 Photos oc Exhibition,\nwhich begins on the 16th of March. The exhibition does not have a theme to it, and pictures range\nfrom the humorous to the abstract,\ntouching to sombre, morbid to\nobscure.\nAs in every year, the standard is\nvery high. As an amateur society,\neverything we' ve learnt and produced is either self-taught or\nthrough the lessons given by the\nsociety to its members. That our\nmembers have devoted so much time to taking and printing the high\nquality images in the exhibition\nshows the passion and enthusiasm\nthat they possess for the hobby.\nFor those new members to the\nhobby, this is the opportunity to\ndisplay the talent they have so far\ndiscovered; while for older\nmembers, it's another chance to\nproudly display their work. The\nex hi b tion runs until the 25th of\nMarch in the Ante Room of the\nSherfield Building, and is definitely\nworth a visit.\nSean Foo\nMore information on diary pages\n\n"

    "content": "13 March 1998 NEWS\nBUSA Put it to Bed\nANDREW OFORI\nThe dust has finally settled concerning Imperial's place in the\nBritish Universities Sports\nAssociation. It appears that IC will\nbe permitted to take part in com petitions as a 'hybrid' entry. The\nsubject has proved to be one of\nthis year's most contentious\nissues, causing numerous debates\nwithin ICU as well as the wider\nLondon student community.\nThe issue arose because of the\nmedical schools' merger with their\nparent institutes throughout\nLondon. At IC the debate centred\naround South Kensington's wish to\njoin with the medics and enter as a single applicant, while IC School of\nMedicine Students' Union insisted\non having two independent entries.\nLast Friday in Birmingham the\nBUS A executive convened and, apparently, laid the issue to rest\nwith a decision to allow universities\nin the London Division to compete in BUS A as 'hybrid' entrants.\nHybrid entry is an ICU idea, and\nallows medics to represent either\ntheir parent institute or medical\ncollege on an exclusive basis.\nOther students of the university will\nonly be allowed to represent their\nown institute. The system has succeeded in placating several other\nLondon universities and their\nrespective medical schools, and\nshould ease the transition from\naffiliate to merged subsidiary. It\nhas been agreed that the system\nwill be used until 2001, when all\nthe universities involved will use\nsingle entries. There is a possibility\nthat the BUS A executive will refuse\nto give the final approval at their\nnext meeting on 15 June, but the\nchances of this are being dismissed\nas \"negligible\" by ICU.\nCharlie Joynt, Deputy President\n(Clubs cv Societies), is relieved that\nthe issue is at an end; \"It got off to\na shaky start - IC council didn't take the right attitude to start off\nwith, however we went back to the\ndrawing board, came up with a better plan and convinced London\nof the plan's worthiness\".\ncontinues from front page\nfacilities remain and expand...\"\nIn his letter, Mr Heeps also\npointed out that under the\nMemorandum of Understandingthe agreement by which College\ndetermines the basis of the Union's existence - the areas designated for\nthe Union include \"the space currently occupied by the Travel\nAgencies... and Sherfield Room216 C[ the site of the present STA\nAcademic Travel shop] in accordance with the terms of the lease\nagreement approved by College on\n9 November 1993\". Although this\ndocument is currently being re writ ten, the present version is still valid.\nHowever, most senior figures questioned believe that the Rector could\nhave it overturned almost at will. Mr Heeps also notes that the Union\npaid \u00a3 2 5 , 0 0 0 four years ago to have\nthe room developed so that it could\nbe used by STA \"converting it from a catering storeroom into the retail\noutlet that currently occupies the\nspace\".\nOn the financial side the outcome comes as another blow, com pounding the loss of income from\nthe Bookstore, for which an appropriate level of compensation has still\nnot been agreed, a year after the\nclos ute. Coming in the same week\nthat the Union Executive agreed to\nspend \u00a3 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 on the essential\nredevelopment of the ground floor\nof the Union Building during the\nsummer, this puts ICU in a precarious position. It has also been a major factor in the recent resignation of Brian Roscoe, the 1CU Shop\nManager\nIt is the long-term strategy\nbehind the move which has caused\nthe greatest concern. Fears that the\nCollege's goal is to remove the\nUnion's right to trade, and replace\nthe income generated with\nincreased central funding may\nsound harmless, but Mr Heeps\nsums-up the feelings of many in the\nUnion in his letter, saying \"such a move would breed a dependency\nculture, which would lead to the\ndownfall of the Union's identity and\npride... It is therefore essential that\nthe Union receives a guarantee that\nthe Union Shop, Newsagents and\nrefectories continue to exist as services run by students for students...\nso that threats which currently\nemanate from the College can be\nquashed\". In the end, however, the\nchain of events means that the JCR\ndevelopment should now go ahead\nin time for the arrival of the medical\nstudents in the Autumn, and the\ncost must now be borne in its\nentirety by College.\nAnjit Chaudhuri forced to run down the walkway wearing only\nwomen's lingerie, after being purchased at the successful RAG / C&G Slave Auction on Tuesday.

Needing nothing\nbut a win to secure their God Given\nplace at the league head. The seconds set about this in a most\namusing manner, as Goran took It\nand back doo red the entire team.\nTo be honest, the first five minutes\nwere a pile of crap. Rob deciding\nto change this took a silky pass\nfrom Goran and rammed it home.\nThen followed what was to be a turning point in the match. IC was\nawarded 2 penalty flicks within 5\nminutes. Lightweight and Rab converted,(30). Kings were not\nhappy. With a brave defensive cry,\nthe Magic hollered \"the onions are\ncoming\" and we were resolute in\nour defence. Half time brought\nthreats from KCL but to their chagrin we were better. We rolled\ndown the pitch in wave after\nrelentless wave of pressure, scoring three more without reply. The\nFifth goal was a peach as Shaggy\nhad time to look up, look down and fart before scoring.\nWe then let Kings have a con sola-tion goal to prove we were\nalso the most generous.

Further pressure resulted in a beautifully taken\ngoal by RS M captain \"sir\" Peter\nSteele. Looking quite comfortable at\nthis stage against a good Camborne\nside, the referee (w anker) decided\nto help his C SM mates out. He did\nthis by awarding one of the most\ndubious penalties of all time.\nHowever, he hadn't noticed that we had a decent\nkeep-er in the form of Nick \"forget\nabout it\" Perrier (geology). However,\nfrom the resulting corner the ref\ndecided to award Camborne a goal.\nNo player from either side knew\nwhy. In fact it was clear that the\nsupposed goal resulted from a ball\nnot even remotely crossing the line.\nRS M were shaken by this and let in\na couple of soft-ish goals. However,\nevery man gave 100%. C SM eventually ran out a42 win which they half\ndeserved to be honest.\nThen came the rugby. Played for\na three-foot tin bottle (hence \"bottle\nmatch\"), which you can see proud-ly\non display in the Union Bar. Right\nfrom the start we had them under\npressure, resulting in James \"pretty\nboy\" Trude (geology) slotting two\npenalties before the bastards in the\nCamborne crowd nicked the kicking tee. Two tries from eventual\nman of the match James \"pool ips\" Philips (ERE) at scrum half buried\nthe Camborne scum. The second of\nhis brace was a gorgeous break\naway solo effort from his own half.\nFurther tries from Rich \"slight of\nframe\" Lloyd (geology) and Dave\nHume( ERE) wrapped up a convincing victory. Not content merely\nto win, the lads also prevented the\nCamborne tw at s from scoring any\npoints, although this was not a new\nexperience for them as few of them\nhave any UCAS points either.

Beating Camborne School of\nmines 1 -0, they brought home the\nillustrious Sharpley Hockey Cup. Solid defending from both\nsides kept the scores at 0-0 at half-time, although RS M were unlucky\n(a goal being dubiously d is al lowed.) The deadlock was broken\nin the second half, when Henry's quick strike left the C SM keeper\nstanding helplessly on his line.\nAfter that, RS M managed to hold a firm back line to emerge as victors.\nMan of the match went to Jamie,\nwho epi tomis ed the RS M defence\nwith his solid tackling.\nC SM remained gracious in\ndefeat afterwards, and it was good to see sporting comments exchanged at the end of such a tightly fought contest.

    "content": "COLUMNS 3 March 1998\nWhen I first heard about this\nWye College 'merger' a couple of\nmonths ago, I was puzzled, as I was last Friday. What, I pon-de red, does Imperial College,\none of the leading universities in\nBritain, want with a tin pot academy for apprentice carrot\ncruncher s from minor public\nschools? A combination of too\nmany late nights and an excessive study of the fine ales of\nSouthside meant that I was\nbeing very naive. There is only\none reason in the world why IC\nwould want Wye. '350 hectares in\nAshford, Kent.' That would be the\nAshford that is close to the\nChannel Tunnel rail link, I pre-s ume. For anyone who still\nthinks that some deluded soul in\nthe upper echelons of the\nCollege sees academic benefits\nfrom this, let me reassure you\nthat this is simply good, old\nfashioned asset stripping. When\nthe link is built, land in the proximity will skyrocket in value as\nthe world and his wife descend\non Kent. Provided Wye College's land is not covered by ancient\nrules that prevent resale or rede-velo p ment, something we nearly\nalways fall foul in these situations, Imperial could make a for-tune. For their part, Wye gets to\ntrade in their\nFord Fiesta\ndegree for a Qj\nBentley-esque\nqualification. f^J It almost /\"Y*> sounds too\ngood to be\ntrue. In the\npast, such\nwonder deals C_ have been.\nPlease let this iy)\ncynical old\nscribe be\nwrong.\nIn recent times, the Royal Family\nseem to have been under a relentless pressure to reform.\nThis drive has supposedly come\nfrom 'the people', who apparent-co ly wish to see a much reduced\nmonarchy that is far cheaper to\nrun than the current arrange-ment. For the most part, this is\nrubbish.

The cost issue is particularly galling. After the\nchanges of the last few years, the\nCivil List is now limited to Her\nMajesty, the Duke of Edinburgh\nand the Queen Mother; those\nwho used to receive payments\nare now supported by the Queen\ndirectly. Moreover, when one\nconsiders that the Queen and\nPrince Charles pay income tax\nand that surplus income from\nthe Crown Estates are given to\nthe Treasury, the idea that we\ncannot afford the status quo is\nludicrous, a malicious slur by\nthose who seek to attack the\ngreat institutions of state. Such\npenny-pinching is not only damaging to the monarchy, but portrays an image of Britain as a spent force to the rest of the\nworld.

    "content": "13 March 1998 COLUMNS\nOne of more useful things about\nhaving new governments is that they\ntake a fresh look at affairs, and find\nit politically a great deal easier to\nchange them. With this in mind, one\nof the first acts of the present\nGovernment was to form a cross-party Modernisation Committee, which looked at ways of making the\nCommons more user-friendly. This\nhas just submitted its report to the\nHouse. This report covers aspects of\nthe debating process itself - more\nfundamental changes to the ways\nMPs work and live are months, if not\nyears away.\nSome of the things that are likely to be scrapped seem to have long\nlived past their usefulness. Under\npresent Parliamentary procedure, if\na Member shouts \"1 spy strangers\",\nthe Speaker must call a vote on whether to ban \"strangers\" from the\nroom. Strangers are people within\nthe Parliamentary building who are\nnot Members or Peers. The name\nStrangers itself is up for review - it is\nconsidered not particularly we l com ing. The procedure was originally\nadopted to prevent agents of the\nmonarch listening in to debates and\nreporting the results back to the\npalace. It was also used during the\nSecond World War for security rea-sons, although it could never realistically be used now, since it would\nnot look too impressive for a constitutional democracy not to let the\npublic hear what its supreme body\nwas discussing. Instead it is used\nnow to interrupt debates, something\nwhich it can do to good effect.\nAnother ridiculous regulation up\nfor the scrap heap is the rule that a Member must be \"seated and cov-ered\" to make a point of order during a debate. Opera hats are placed\nat strategic points around the cham-ber, and whilst one is being passed\nthemselves suspended, although\nthey may soon be unpaid. There are\ncertain limits to what can be done\nwithin disciplinary policy - a person\nreturned by a constituency should\nnot just be told he can't turn up or\nvote anymore, since that goes\ndirectly against the principle of\ndemocracy, but there are certain\nthings that can and it seems, will be\ndone to redress the balance. On the\nHamish Common\nWestminster Eye\nto the Member making the point,\nthey tend to cover their head with a piece of paper. The vision of an MP making a serious point on parliamentary procedure whilst wearing a silly hat has, in the view of the\nModernisation Committee, \"almost\ncertainly brought the House into\ngreater ridicule than almost any\nother. We do not believe that it can\nbe allowed to continue.\"\nThe House is also cracking down on bad behaviour from its members\n- showing a new sensitivity to public\nopinion on its rowdiness and ill-dis-c ip line. Presently, Members can\nobtain some free publicity by getting\nissue of general behaviour within the\nchamber, various ideas that were\nproposed (mainly by the new intake)\nwere discarded: Members will still\naddress the Speaker, rather than\neach other; Members will call each\nother \"the Hon Member for [con-st it u en cy]\" rather than by name (this\nwas to make it more difficult to refer\nto each other quickly, to stop\ndebates degenerating into slang ing matches); Members will still vote in\nperson; and finally, the Speaker can\nstill hold Members to account for\ntheir behaviour. One change will\noccur though: members of the Privy\nCouncil (those who are called \"Rt\nHon\"- members and ex-members of the Cabinet and\nparty leaders) will no longer\nreceive preference in the\nspeaking order, to allow all\nMembers to receive equal treatment\nwithin the chamber.\nOne of more interesting, and\nperhaps most important recommendation from the committee was\nthat certain bills could go through\nParliament more slowly, taking two years rather than just one. The\nadministrative nightmare of allowing\nthe Channel Tunnel Rail Link Bill to\ntake longer than a single parliamentary term (period of time between\nQueen's Speeches) was generally\nconsidered to be senseless waste of\ntime. This would prevent debacles\nsuch the law creating the Child\nSupport Agency, which was rushed\nthrough without proper scrutiny,\nbequeathing us the present mess.\nThe minutiae of parliamentary\nprocedure may seem dull to those\nnot involved (if you think this lot was\nbad, the don't read Erskine May, the\n6 0 0 + page guide to procedure: veteran MPs say they still don't understand it all) but it is vitally important\nin the passage of sensible legislation\nand maintaining Parliament high in\nthe public esteem. If the\nGovernment can do this well, they\nwill certainly have left at least one\ngood legacy to its successors.\n[<{^CS Chem Df aw Pio[ Untitled document1] iiii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii in II\n[7*1 File Edit Tools Obiect Structure Text Curves Color\" \u2022 Estimate Window \u2022 | G \u00a3 | H|m\\!11 H1^l<s i LJ I \u2014 :;\ni \"TO\nQC s sHOp,17 Me O.1J^'\"^^\"* CCS SHOP Level4 Mechanical Engineering Building ext. 4 6 9 5 3\nccs shop@ ic.a c.uk\\/||9.30 am5.00p m(We d10.00am5.00p m)I1 \u00a379.00 inc.
