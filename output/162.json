    "content": "z FELIX\nTHE CARNIVAL\nMAGAZINE\nThe very high standard of recent issues\nof \"Phoenix\" led one to expect that the\nCarnival issue would be something really\nspecial. This, and the amount of painstaking work which has been put into\nthe magazine, make it all the more unfortunate that the standard is a little dis-appointing.\nObviously the o on tent of a Carnival\nMagazine must be of a light nature, but\nthe Carnival has its serious side too \u2014\nthe work of OXFAM is hardly a laughing\nmatter \u2014 and a little more emphasis on\nthis would have resulted in a better balanced magazine. An article surveying, in\na general way, the work of the Oxford\nCommittee would have been well worth\nincluding. No doubt the inclusion of two\nreprints was necessitated by a shortage\nof new material, for which the student\nbody as a whole must take the blame\n(this includes the present writer). In any\ncase, both items were worth reprinting.\nIt is in the presentation that the usual\nPhoenix excellence seems most lacking\nThe cover is a mess, and the hideous \"old-fashioned print\" on the title page heightens the bad impression. More of these\nrather tasteless things appear in the centre\npages \u2014 one of them can only be described as revolting. The James Bond skit\nwould have been better all together rather\nthan split up by advertisements. These are\nsmall points, but the impression they give\nis cumulative.\nOn the credit side there are some very\nwitty articles and a few really good car-toons. John Reason comes up with some\nvery sound advice to those w| io find London a difficult place in which to move a round. John Galvaston comments on our\nslot machine oc racy and Tony Musgrave\nwarns us all that gambling and women\ndon't mix. Despite its shortcomings, this\nPhoenix is worth buying. All the proceeds\nremember, go towards our OXFAM effort.\nA.L.B. NOTED...

At a discussion meeting it was: she was a Chelsea-type blonde\nwho asked me the incredible question:\n\"Did I go to Dublin University?\" After\nexplaining that it was the hag g is country\nthat came from not the hooch country I left. Of course not knowing what every\ngood student knows I completely forgot\nto find out her name, add reB S or telephone\nnumber. Quel bel fool. However, I found\nout by discreet enquiry that her name was\nMary McPhee; with the aid of the telephone directory I was thus able to send\nher a letter inviting her to the theatre,\nmentioning who I was since I had forgotten to tell her my name, and generally\npraising her to the skies.\nI never got a reply, and had almost\ngiven up the whole business as a bad job\nwhen she suddenly appeared in\" the drive\non a red bicycle; I nearly, had a fit and\nthe next-door neighbour phoned )\nfco ask\nwho the blonde was. I recovered my senses\nand arranged to pick her up the next day\nin a suitable vehicle.\nThe day was fine. I collected her and\nwe drove into town; on the way she suddenly thumped her hand on the dashboard\nand said:\n\"There's one thing we'd better get\nstraight.\" My respect for her rose, she\nwas so very shrewd.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"My name's not McPhee, it's Watson.''\nStone the crows, I thought to myself, who\nis this woman anyway? \"You see, my\nfather was killed in the Second World\nWar, my mother's a commercial artist\nin South Kensington, and I live with my\naunt called McPhee.\"\n\"I see,\" I replied as if this were a commonplace occur ance. We drove on in relative silence, I was feeling a trifle\nstunned but after all it's not really un-usual.\n'Just after we reached town she turned\nto me. Wait for it, I thought.\n\"By the way,\" she Baid, \"There's another thing. Soon I'm going to stay with\nmy mother in South Ken, and she always\ncalls me by my second name.\" I\\ did\na double take and. said:\n\"Well, do you want me to call you by\nyour first name or your second?\"\n\"You might as well get used to the\nidea of calling me by my second name.\"\nWas this woman mad, or what?\n\"Well, what is your second name?\"\n\"Esmaralda, and I hate abr evi at ions.\" This would< take more getting used tc\nthan I could manage. I had taken out\na girl called Mary McPhee, and was now\ntaking back a girl called Esmeralda\nWatson. The crazy thing about this story\nis it's true.\nDear Sir.\nWe wish to inform you that John White\nand John D. White are not related ph v sic ally, mentally, or in any other wav.\nThe first of us is Carnival Competition\nOrganiser, 1st Year Aero and Weeks Hall,\nthe second is President of the Huxley\nSociety, 2nd Year Physics and Wormwood\nScrubs.\nYour seperate iy, John White\nJohn D. White\nDear Sir,\nLoath as I am to have to complain\nabout the results achieved by the faithful\nfew who organised the Carnival Ball, the\narrangements for the buffet were a dis-grace!\nHow on earth is one supposed to e.'y a salad at 10.20 at night standing in a corner of the middle refectory surrounded\nby dirty plates, trays of glasses and\nsqueezed in between the entrance to the\nkitchen and one of the staff cleaning\nf lasses? Surely arrangements could have\neen made to increase the number of\n\"sittings\" (I hate to use the word ) so that\none could at least sit down in reasonable\ncomfort to eat the most at tr aci ve food I have yet seen to appear from the middle\nrefectory. Considering that even in Joe\nLyons one normally can sit down, although\nthe food is much inferior, surely for \u00a3 2.2s. it is not unreasonable to hope to sit down\nto enjoy the food.\nI do not know who was responsible, or\neven if the Entertainments Committee\nwere concerned with such details about\nthe buffet, but it seemed to me to be\nspoiling the ship for a ha'pp or th of tar.\nYours sincere lv, A.S. Chalmers, RiS.M. JUtttvia ta the Edltm\nYES, UNILATERALISM IS THE ANSWER\nDear Sir,\nI enclose a short article which I wrote\nimmediately after reading Mr. Finch's contribution to Scrunity entitled \"Is Unilateralism the Answer?\" It represents an\nimpulsive reaction, not a carefully planned\nanswer to Mr. Finch's article. I have\nnot altered it because in its present state\nit conveys some of the urgency wh ic|>I feel is very necessary in this matter.\nIt is due to this sense of urgency which\nI feel that I am submitting this article\nto you and not to Scrunity.\nYours,\nPeter Young\n(P.G. Mineral Dressing)\n'b ince both Russia and the U.S.A. have\nenough nuclear weapons to destroy civil-is ation', writes Mr Finch in the latest\nissue of Scrunity. 'I do not believe that\nunilateral disarmament by this country can\nimprove the prospects of world peace.\"' I disagree entirely. Since America has enough nuclear weapons to destroy Russia\nour bombs o an make little difference to\nthe situation except to increase the danger\nof nuclear war, so why waste money on\nthem? If we must have nuclear protection\nwe can have America's. But another argument is more powerful ; France, Sweden and probably China\nare working towards their own A bombs\nand are thus increasing the danger of nuclear war. With the U.S.A. and Russia\nonly armed with H bombs we have a relatively simple situation but when neutrals and allies have them the balance is* more complex and the chances of disarmament are less. The first stage of disarmament must be the prevention of the\nspreading of H bombs and this can be done\nif France, Sweden and China are stopped\nin time. The only argue ment which will\nstop them is the renouncing of nuclear\nweapons by one or more of the three nuclear powers; Russia and the U.S. will\nnot do it so the onus rests with Britain\nto take the lead, to tell these countries\nas forcibly as possible that they are wasting their time and money and clinch the\nargue ment by getting rid of a11 our nuclear arms, a11 our radiological and bacteriological weapons and cutting down our\nconventional forces to the minimum. Half\nthe money thus saved could well be spent\non an enormous propaganda drive to turn\nworld opinion against nuclear arms and\nthe other half could be used for direct\ngifts to poor countries.\nNegotiation within the U.N. is all very\nwell but it is subject to all manner .of\ndelays and technical hitches and is used\nby the various governments as a political\ntool like any other. Discussions are not\nvery far advanced and no party to the\ndiscussions has yet conceded something definite without retracting or denying it- And\nall the time the urgency becomes greater. It\nis a matter of months now, not decades\nas it was when the talks started, before\nanother country builds an operational bomb\nand still the political bargaining and lying\ngoes on. It is not the fault of the U.N.. it is the fault of all the parties to the\ndisarmament- conferences for not being\nmore willing to come to agreement. The\ndeadlock must be broken and the C.N.D.o if ers a bold, imaginative plan for doing\njust that. Peter Young\nThe innocent\nat the hints\nWe don't even know what the film's title is yet, but it's the usual sequence;\na man and a woman in a double bed, and\nit's obvious to all but the more.immature\nunder-nines in the audience that they are\nnot married. (Married people don't behave like that, they sleep in matching\ntwin beds with a contemporary bedside\ntable in between, on which are the sleeping tablets, the sedatives and the Reader's Digest Bedside Companion.) Sometimes\nthese bedside films are really good, as\nwas \"Room at the Top\", that carefully\ndrawn caricature of the industrial West\nRiding, but as the craze catches on it\nlooks as though we are going to see some\nreally bad ones.\nOccasionally one feels, as the man in\nthe bed Ijies back and f reveals a chest\nhairy enough to make gorilla green, occasionally it would be pleasant to get back\nto Buchanesque thrillers: those breezy\nstories full of Ruritanians fixing some\nclean-shaven all-British hero in the telescopic sights of a rifle, somewhere in the\nScottish Highlands. It< seems incredible\nto think, as the woman slides out og bed\nat last, to reveal to the steaming audience\nthat s he is not quite naked after all,\nthough one would thought so from all that\nsly pulling up of the bedclothes, that there\nis only one woman in the Thirty-nine\nSteps, and that she was at least middle-aged. It takes a rare writer these days to\nwrite any sort of novel without including\nat least one sexually attractive woman in\nthe characters. This is not to say that\nBuchan's stories have more literary merit\nthan say Sillitoe's Saturday Night and\nSunday Morning, they have not, but the\ninnocent would have thought that since it\ntakes a writer of some calibre to centre a story round the man-woman relationship\nand since film scriptwriters are rarely of\nany calibre at all, the film makers would\nbe providing more satisfactory entertainment if they concentrated on other themes.\nWesterns for instance.\nConsider the advantages of the Western. The innocent's re colle c ions of the\nAmerican Middle West, drawn exclusively\nfrom Westerns, can be combined into one\nscene. In the middle of a vast plain lies\na town consiting of a few match boarding houses and a saloon with those peculiar\nswing doors. If we are lucky there is a railway station without platforms, and in the\nbackground is an ancient locomotive, hissing gently, while in the foreground cowboys lounge in the dust, occasionally tilting back their hats and getting up to shoot\neach other. The characters in this bucolic\nscene communicate by bullets or monosyllabic grunts, thus solving the script-writer's problems right away. They also\nappear to be wearing their oldest jeans,\nso one can assume that the costume bill\nhas been considerably reduced. The sc en ary is free to any film company prepared\nto drive a few hundred miles into the\ndesert. As for 'the buildings, they look\nfairly portable, and in any case the same\nsets appear to have been used in several\ndifferent films so that there is no danger\nof the company being left with a life-size\nplywood Coliseum, or anything like that, on\nits hands if the stars get dysentery from\neating un hygienically merchandised ve ge tables.\nThus it would appear that a film company with mediocre resources would stand\na better chance of making passable entertainment out of a Western than out of a film with any other theme. The combination of impressive scenery and the exciting action of a gunfight is a good one.\nAnd when a film company hires not only\na scriptwriter of some ability but also one\nor two good actors as well, the result is\noften outstanding. Of the purely gun-fighting Westerns in recent years, The\nLaw and Jake Wade and Warlock were\nexcellent entertainment. Another theme\nhas been the rootless gunman who wants\nto settle down, and there have been man v variations on this. The Gunfighter, High\nNoon, and Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\nall had this as one of their themes. Others\nof note were Shane and 3.10 to Yuma,\nboth rather different from the usual run\nof Westerns in their emphasis, but still\nincluding the same basis ingredients.\nBut of all these, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, which the Film Society had as\none of the pictures on the programme cf\nthe Carnival Film Festival on Wednesday,\nmust rank as the finest. Burt Lancaster\nand Kirk Douglas, a script that is on lv rarely corny and that*final vendetta, all\ngo to make up two hours of really excellent screen entertainment. When it comes\nto bedside melodramas and those incredibly corny epics, just pass me my lons;-barrelled Colt.\n\n"

This wind, however,\nconsiderably helped the sprinters but was\nagainst the long and triple jumpers.\nWith the University truck at Motspur in\nits usual excellent condition it was unfortunate that all three colleges were fielding\ndepleted teams. Mines had lost some members to a field course, Guilds were without\nMaodonald (University Captain) who is\nCollege reo or d holder for the sprints, and\nB.C.S. had lost Clifton (Half-mile\nChampion, 1960) and Wenk (440 yd. ie-o or d holder). The last three were at Loughborough with the University team.\nThe team result was an overwhelming\nwin for E.C. S. with 174 points to the 128\nof Guilds and 81 of Mines. Although this\nwas B.C.S.' s second win in succession it\nshould be noted that Guilds have won 23\ntimes in the last thirty years. B.C.8. had\nthe individual winner in thirty events as\nwell as winning the Tug o' War and Half\nMile Belay, while Guilds won the 4x110 yd.\nBelay and had Wigginton first in the Pole\nVault. Mines honour was upheld by Fairfield and Nicholson who were first and\nsecond in the High Jump.\nThe B.C.S. captain, Spioer, set his team\na good example by winning the first event,\nthe 120 yd. Hurdles, but the outstanding\nindividual was Harrison (B.C.S.) who besides running in the Belay won the 100 yd s in 10.2 Bee, the 220 yd s in 22.7 see.,\nthe Long Jump in 20 ft. 3 in., and the\nTriple Jump in 42 ft. 8J in. \u2014 the latter\nbeing a new Sports Day best performance.\nThe trophy for the best Field Events performance was returned by Connolly\n(B.C.S.), who again won the Shot Putt\n(40 ft. 9i in.) and the Javelin (162 ft.\n8i in.).\nThe College record to be beaten was the\n1,500 m. steeplechase where Cleator, who\nhad already easily won the 1 Mile in 4\nmin. 19.9 sees., broke his own record with\na time of 4 min. 26.9 sec. Last term\nCleator had also run the 3 Miles in the\nexo ellen t time of 14.05, which besides being a new College record was the fi the\nfastest time in the country this year.\nMines are to be especially congratulated\non their performance as they only had\nnine competitors (including their President, Paul Buet, who took sixth place in\nthe Long Jump) for all fourteen track and\nfield events.\nThe Staff Baoe, in which the Presidents\nalso competed, was won by a surprise en-try, Miss Anne Mathews of the Civil Engineering Dept., who easily beat Messrs.\nHill, Greaves and Buet and three male\nmembers of staff 1 The handicap system\nso un gallant as to beat the lady even if\nensured that none of the men could be\nhe BO desired.\nThe only other notable competitor was\nMike Barron, who not only played for the\nBasketball Club, who beat ICWSC 3-1 at\nnetball, but also ran for his old College\nin the Half-mile Belay and the 440 yd s.

A. came third to Bedford College\nand the Eoyal Free Hospital; defeating\nGoldsmith's, Middlesex Hospital, U.C., Westfield, Chelsea and Q.M. C. It is the\nfirst time that I. C.W. A. have done so\nwell, and thanks are due to the untiring\nefforts of Janet Hiscox and Buth Oldham.\nI.C. were narrowly defeated by St.\nMary's Hospital in the U.L. Championships at Motspur Park on Saturday 13th May, despite some fine Individual per-form ances. On Wednesday, John Cleator easily won\nthe 3000 m. steeplechase in the good time\nof 9 min. 25.8sec, with Ted Wilkins running well to gain see on a place. We also\npicked up points in the triple jump\nthrough Jim Harrison (3rd) and the two-mile walk, with John Collins finishing\n4th, in his first serious race in his new\nevent.\nWe had a fine start on Saturday, with\nJohn Cleator winning very well in the one-mile from Speryn of St. Mary's, a very\nfine performance. Paul Potter and Archie\nMacDonald also achieved good perform-ances, winning the pole vault and 220 yd s respectively. G. Wenk dominated the 880\nyd s, leading the whole way, and winning\nin 1 min. 55.5 sec, for which he was\nawarded the trophy for the best track performance of the afternoon. Ian Linklater\nexcelled himself in the 440 yd s hurdles,\na oh ie ving a personal best performance in\n5th place.\nI.C. also did well in the 100 yd s, once\nagain Jim Harrison and Archie MacDonald\n(3rd and 4th). Dave Hammonds and Ted\nWilkins worked through the field in the\nthree-mile, and were lying a very comfortable 2nd and 3rd behind Mitchell\n(U.C.) at the end of two miles. Wilkins\nthen opened up a40 yd s gap on Hammonds,\nand was going well rt in til the last lap,\nwhen he very surprisingly cracked up,\nprobably due to the hot weather.\nHammonds pressed on to take 2nd place,\nand Wilkins gamely finished in 5th place.\nThe final track event in which I.C. was\nrepresented was the 440 yd s. Archie MacDonald, in his 3rd event of the afternoon,\nvery nearly pulled off a surprise by win-ning, but had to be content with 2nd place, in a new College record time of\n49.2 sec. Bill Wood hung on well to 4th place in 51.3 sec.\nOnce again in the throwing events I.C. were carried along by two people, Connolly\nand Alcock. Colin Connolly waded through\nall four throwing events, and finished with\ntwo 3rds and two 4th s. Tony Alcook finished 4th in the discus, despite his efforts\nin the 120 yd s hurdles on Wednesday.\nI. C.W. A must be congratulated on winning the Sherwood Cup, which was well\ndeserved for their enthusiasm if not their\nskill.\nWe are now looking forward to our next\nannual battle with St. Mary's and a reversal of Saturday's result.\nHOCKEY TOUR OF HOLLAND\nAt 9.15 on Thursday April 6th a train\nleft Liverpool Street Station bound for\nHarwich, containing an eager band of fit\nyoung men, and in the same carriage was\nthe fourteen strong party of the Imperial\nCollege Hockey Club bound for Holland.\nThe North Sea crossing was uneventful\nwith a calm sea and blue skies providing\na good omen for our stay in Holland,\nand it proved to be for the weather remained perfect throughout the tour.\nWe arrived in Groningen at 11.00 p.m. after a long and tiring journey (during\nwhich we achieved the distinction of drinking the train dry in one-and-a half-hours)\nand were met by a large crowd of the\nhockey club \"Forward\" of the University.\nThere followed a somewhat heavy reception at which the menu consisted of\nbeer, beer, ger ever, brand j win and\nmore beer, all of which proved a. little\ntoo much for several members of the party\nbut which was a foretaste of things to\ncome.\nThe following day, having spent the\nmorning recovering, we played the Forwardiens (a5 team drawn from the tour\ning party wh i oh came to England two\nyears ago) and thanks to two fine goals\nby Clarke, some judicious use of feet and\nabl fe l!ump f ring by the secretary, whose\nrange of vision had been rendered somewhat restricted by the previous night's festivities, we managed to draw a most\n6n;o y able game 2-2.\nOn Saturday we were guests at a reception given by the town Hockey Club\non the o ecas ion of their 35th anniversary ;\nthis was followed by a thoroughly enjoyable dance, and as a result of wh i oh very\nlittle sleep was had by all. This also resulted in our arriving at the Mixed Hockey\nTournament next day a little late though\nstill in time to learn that we had lost\nour first match. Both our teams continued\nin this vein with the result that we wp nt share in a bottle of o in jars as the strongest teams in the tournament. This was\nfollowed by a tea dance at which the only\nbeverage was beer l During the day bicycles were introduced as a means of transport with chaotic results, and several\nmembers, of the team learnt some new\nDutoh words.\nOn Monday\" we played a match against\nthe University team, and fie whole team\nreally exo el led itself. It was a very clean,\nfast game and the standard bf hookey\nshown by both sides was very high: the\nfact that we won 4-1 speaks well for our\nperformance. The goals were scored by\nPhillips (3) and de Brookert. That evening we were given a farewell dinner in\ntheir Union wh i oh proved a most riotous\nevent, putting recent events in Algeria\nand Cuba very mu oh in the shade; the\nmortality rate amongst plates, glasses and\ndiners was very high. The whole evening\nwas a very fine conclusion to a memorable\nvisit to Groningen;' but proved yet again\nto be too much for some.\nNext day we moved on to Amsterdam\nwhere we spent a recuperative 24 hours\nin sight-seeing wh i oh included a trip\nround the canals and do ok s on the\nWednesday morning and a visit to the\nAmstel Brewery at wh i oh the tour of the\nworks was cut down to a quarter of an\nhour \u2014 our guide proved TO be au utc h international hockey player. We moved on\nto Delft that day and after being very\nwell |rec Bi ved we played indoor hockey\nat a fabulous new sports centre. The\ngame is played six-a side with sub-st it ute s, on a pitch 30 yards by 40\nyards, and is rather like ice-hockey in\nthat the side walls can be used. Despite\nthe fact that the English style of play is\nnot very well suited to the game, we won\none and lost one game against two teams\nwhich had had considerable experience.\nThursday was a free day and was spent\nsight-seeing in Rotterdam, The Hague and\nHilversum. On Friday we played S'.V. H.C, the Catholic section of Delft University,\nand were well beaten 4-1 in a very hard,\nfast game on a rather bumpy pitch. We\nwere entertained that evening by the S.V gin-drinking club to as owe what unusual\ndinner where the food was served mostly\non the walls of the room. The company\nthen proceeded en masse to the cinema,\nwhich seemed to be a regular Friday evening oe our eno e, as the public very wisely\nstayed away. We then returned to their\nUnion, where the bar remains open until there are less than five people present:\nas a result 5.00 a.m. seemed to be the\naverage closing lime during our st av. On Saturday we moved to The Hague\nwhere we played against Groengel H.C.. one of the many hockey clubs in the city,\nand won deservedly 2-1 in what proved to\nbe yet another enjoyable game.

CARNIVAL IN RETROSPECT\nby a member of the Carnival Committee, who prefers to remain anonymous. This Is true story. The names have been changed to protect the others.\nFriday, 5th May. \u2014 D Day, and the\nBall was set rolling. And what a Ball, the\n\u2022 May Ball of course, whose merits must\nhave been anticipated, since there was almost a complete sell-out of tickets. Apart\nfrom the fact that the weather was good,\nthat Chris Adams produced a most excellent cabaret, and that the Jazz Bands\nwere able to play on unflagging ly into the\nearly hours of the morning, congratulations must go to Tony Miller and the Entertainments Committee, whose work in\npro duo ing the May Ball was surely appreciated by everyone. One slight criticism\nthat might be made is that the lower refectory was exp eot ed to hold twice as many\npeople as there were, seats for the buffet\nsupper, but besides this, the evening went\nwithout any serious mishaps. During the\ncourse of the evening the Carnival Organiser, Si Lyle, introduced the Carnival\nQueen, Krystina Bragiel, and presented\nher with a or own and a bouquet of roses.\nThe Carnival Queen,\nKrystina Bragiel\nThen on to Monday, when the Carnival\nCommittee took over, presenting a Barbeque dance in Prince's Gardens. As during\nthe rest of the week, they were favoured\nby good weather. The Carnival Grand Balloon Bace, sponsored by Guinness, made\nits debut while owing to a last minute\ntechnical hitch in the Jazz Band, dancing\nwas done to gramophone records under\nfloodlight. Food was provided on entry and\nwas cooked on a fire on one of the paths.\nTuesday night was Quad Nite. The\nQuad was turned into ami nature fairground for the evening, and Beit Hall\n, residents were treated among s, other\nthings to the fairly unusual sight of a tor-! to is era oe by several comatose tortoises.\nVarious other attractions such as skittles,\ndarts and ball-throwing all brought the\ninfallible, unbreakable coconut as a prize.\nThe Jazz Band were again playing, while\nin a corner of the Quad, a new record\nwas being set up. Yes, believe it or not,\nand most of the College must have wondered what was going on if they didn't already know, Tony Biggins was putting\non a Twenty-Four Hour Domino Marathon,\nin the form of a non-stop game of dominos.\nstarting at 11.30 a.m. on Tuesday, and\nending at the same time on the next day.\nCongratulations Tony I On Wednesday, there was the Gala Film\nNight. Many thanks to the Film Society\nfor showing 'Lavender Hill Mob' and\n'Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.'\nThursday evening saw the production\nb v the Dramatic Society of The Black\nStirks Light', and of a small concert by\nThe Dominoes Marathon In progress\nthe Musical society, xm s was unfortunately very poorly attended, which can\nonly prove that culture\", even in the very\nworthwhile form of this particular present-ation, is not appreciated by Imperial College.\nAnother dance on Friday, the Carnival\nDance, with music from the Les Layton's Band, and the I.C. Jazz band. About 120\ncouples were present, and Finlay McPherson oom per eda 'Jive for a Prize' contest.\nUnfortunately the winning couple must\nremain anonymous, since he forgot to ask\nthem their names.\n'And finally Saturday, when a very weary\nCarnival Committee presented the Carnival Fete, preceded by a procession of\nfloats, and followed by a Jazz Hop. Stalls\nstarted to appear in Prince's Gardens fairly early in the morning, and by the time\nthe procession set off at 1.30 p.m. preparations were almost completed.\nThe procession was headed by the Fete\nOrganiser, Jon Bareford, in his 'car' with\na hunting-horn-blower. Then came the\nCarnival Queen standing on a Landrover,\nfollowed by the three Constituent College\nVehicle Moscots. The Mines lorry made it\nto the end of Prince Consort Road,. but\nwas not able to complete the route. However, Bo and Jez were in fine form and\nmade up for this. These were followed by\nnine or ten departmental floats, including\none on which the Jazz Band were again\nplaying. The procession was only marred\nby the fact that one of the floats fell onto\na car, but no one was hurt. The route,\nto the great delight of the police, covered\nKensington, Fulham, and Chelsea as comprehensively as possible, and most people\nwho took part seem to enjoy themselves\nexcept the Public (especially those standing in bus queues).\nAt about 2.45 the procession arrived back\nat Prince's Gardens, now with the addition of a Black Maria (picked up, it is\nthought, somewhere in Fulham), and shortly after this a second procession arrived\nconsisting of the Carnival Organiser and\nSeoretary with the Rector and his wife,\nSir Patrick and Lady Linstead; the Mayor\nand Mayoress of Kensington, Councillor\nand Mrs J.G. Bawle; the Mayor and\nMayoress of Westminster; Councillor and\nMrs, R.L. Everest, and Miss Vanessa Redgrave, who at the last moment, when the\nCommittee were in despair, kindly agreed\nto open the Carnival Fete. Miss Mary Ure,\nwith her husband John Osborne, was originally to open the Fete, but is now unfortunately in hospital.\nThen, just after 3.00 p.m. Miss Redgrave\nopened the Fete by letting off a cluster of\ngas-l filled balloons, and then she, Lady\nLinstead, and the two Mayoresses were\neach presented with a bouquet of flowers\nby the Carnival Queen. The Fete then went\ninto full swing, to the music of the band\nof the Coldstreams Guards, with help from\nthe Musical Society while they weren't playing. Altogether, there were about 50\nside shows, and a refreshment marquee.\nA particularly popular attraction was\n\"Ducking the President'-' which in fact\nincluded most of the College officials.\nIn the evening, when ^he Fete had died\na natural death, the Jazz Hop started,\nagain in Prince's Gardens. Large numbers\nturned up, and thanks go again to the\nJazz Band for providing the music. The\nCarnival Committee then went to bed.\n(Onlv one is so far reported to have recovered just for long enough to write this\narticle.)\nFinally, the Carnival Committee would\nlike to sincerely thank all these in the\nCollege, staff and students alike who\nworked to make th le Carnival possible.\nThey would like to thank especially the\nJazz Club, who gave up a large amount of\ntime to play during Carnival Week, and\nalso the International Relations Club, who\nwere able to raise a considerable amount\nof money by running a number of Carnival\nLunches last term and this, and who were\nextremely active in the preparations for\nu arni vai Week. They would like to thank\nViscount Hailsham, the Bector, and the\nMayors of Kensington and Westminster\nfor kindly acting as patrons, and Miss\nVanessa Redgrave for giving up her time\nto open the Fete. Lastly, they would like\nto thank the American School in Exhibition Boad for supp li ying power for the\nFete; the numerous firms who contributed\nto the Carnival; the landlord of the Queen's who provided the bar lice no e and the\ndrink to go with it; and finally the long-suffering Police, who, besides being most\nhelpful to the Committee, exercised their\nusual calm and patience in particularly\ntrying circumstances.\nAt the time of going to Press, it was\nnot possible to estimate the total profit\nmade by the CamivaL but, I, speaking\nas a member of the Carnival Executive,\nam sure that no donation can be too small\nfor the Oxford Committee for Famine\nRelief.\nTHANKYOU EVERY ON F in Immaculate Bo at the start of the\nprocession.\nUNION\nA*G*M \u00ab\nTODAY\nFriday, May 19th, In the Concert Hall,\nat 1.15 p.m. AGENDA1.

    "content": "FELIX 3\nOnce again. Felix makes student press history I Here for the first time is\nA BEDFORD SUPPLEMENT\nSOUND AN ALA/RUM\nThere can be little doubt that Bedford\nCollege has the most pleasant and exo lu sive situation of any of the London colleges.\nThe bustle of town is held at the bay\non the one hand by a strategically placed\nmoat and on the other by the breathless\nhush of the Inner Circle. Here, as nowhere else in the Metropolis, peace and\ntranquillity reign and while less respectable establishments now admit the dubious Jfrifluence of men, Bedford College\nfn is is not to say that they falling behind 'the* times hp wever. The sciences\nare, we believe, studied there; the departments of Chymystry and Physiks are\namong the most advanced of their kind.\nTeaching methods are also highly ad-vance d, so that one should be surprised,\nfor example, to observe English students\nre-enacting some of the more interesting\nincidents from Sir Gawaine and the Green\nKnight as an integral part of their studies.\nThere .has - been considerable building\nand improvement round the College late-ly, such as that to the Union and Reid\nHall. A notable innovation in the latter\nhas been the installation of a burglar\nalarm system. If this has caused the residents to be more diligent in obtaining\nthe proper late night passes then we must\nsuppose that it is a good thing. However,\nrumours that the bridge that one crosses\nto reach the main entrance is to be converted to a drawbridge and fitted with a portcullis are unfounded. The road is a public right of way.\nPORTRAIT GALLERY\nAngela Cowgill, the new Athletics\nChairman has two interests \u2014 SPORT,\nand is as one can see from the .photo not\na typical black-stocking product of Bedford. Perhaps this is due to her luck in\nhaving a sister who was President of\nI.C. W.S.C. The family's connections with\nI.C. do not appear to have been broken\ncompletely as Angela claimed to be a member of I.C. Photographic Society in\nher election manifesto. This was difficult\nto corroborate; the treasurer said she had\nnot paid a subscription, the Vice-president\nrefered to me to the Secretary who said\nthat she appeared in the minutes as\n\"supplier of coffee to the Portrait Group\nleader.\" The Portrait Group leader was\nhowever, in North Wales for the weekend\nwith the Y. H. Group.\nAmong Angela's other activities she is\nH committee member of the Bedford Y. H. Group.\nWHITE ELEPHANT SALE\nMany yards of green, purple and silver\nblazer cloth available at bargain prices.\nSuitable for curtains, cushion covers,\nscarves, dresses, short shorts, tapered\ntr ews or brief bikinis. Not to mention\nblazers. All reasonable offers considered.\nEnquires and suggestions to Bedford\nUnion Society.\nCARNIVAL (OTHER ONE)\nFrom our Bedford Correspondent\nOnce again this College is helping with\nthe U.L. Carnival, unlike ' I.C. Even\nthough the I.C. Carnival will probably raise\nmore money than the U.L. one, we feel\nthat the University should come first, and\nanyway some of the boys one meets from\nKings are rather sweet.\nNEW PAPER\nOF BEDFORD UNION\nThe old handbook assures Bedford\nfresher s that \"Bedford News\" appears\nevery fortnight throughout the first two\nterms. In fact it has only appeared once\nor twice a term. For those who never saw\none it looked much like \"Felix\".\nThis year it has been decided to make\na completely new start. Miss Harvey\nWebb, a first year philosophy student,\nand past editor of St. Hilda's( Whitby)\nschool magazine, is co-operating with\nMiss Colquitt-Craven to give Bedford a more professional looking newspaper on\nthe lines of Sennet. This new paper must\nhave a large circulation and a lot of advertising space must be sold at about ten\nshillings per column-inch. Apparentlv it\nis intended to produce it about three times\nper term, so that it can hard lv perform\nthe function of a newspaper, but will be,\nequivalent to a cross between \"Phoenix\"\nand \"Felix\" (horrible thought).\nUNION ELECTIONS\nThis year six of the nine posts were con-tested, this being the highest proportion\nfor the last four years. However, the increased interest was not reflected throughout the iJ ni on as a whole, and the usual\napathy prevailed. The advance publicity\nshowed little originality, except that of\none candidate who produced very professional posters with large photos surrounded\nby stencilled lettering. The usual lack of\nrespect was shown by those who stuck\n^leas to Vote for \u2014 on the nv;;cb ': all\nthe lavatory doors. I.C. is fortunate indeed to be spared this indignity\nIt became apparent at the hu&ti^gs oh at the increase in the number of ^adi dates was not accompanied by an increase in\ntheir quality. For example, the post of\nAthletics Chairman was contested for the\nfirst time in nine years, but of the three\ncandidates only one had ever been to the\nCollege Athletic ground.\nIt is to be hoped that the new officers\ncan arouse more interest in the Union, and\nthat we will be able to raise our quorum\nof eighty at Union meetings more often.\nMARITIAL BLISS\nYou're trapped, you're engaged, to a student from Bedford College 1 And\nyou're loaded, late uncle has made you\nconsiderably richer, or your skill with\npermutations and combinations has finally proved its worth, or perhaps trap three\ncame up at the White City. Her parents\nconsider that you should marry her, and\nyou are only too keen to fix an early date.\nThere seems no escape but to live happily\never after.\nThere remain but the formalities at\nCollege; your fiancee goes to inform\nthe Bursar of the impending change of\nname and address, since Reid Hall does\nnot yet provide married quarters.\nThe questions begin, what of her course?\nWill she leave .early or see it through?\nCan she work, keep a flat and a husband,\nall at once? What about money? Doubts\nstart to arise in the poor girl's mind. After\nthis talk with the Bursar, almost identical questioning must be endured from the\nRegistrar.\nNow comes the academic side cross-examination from her tutor followed by\nan interrogation from the head of the dep-art ment, and she still persists in wanting to marry you. But now comes the final inquisition from the Principal, and going against her refusal may mean a sudden \u00a9nd tp the Bedfordian'a academic\ncareer.\nDon't let this raise your hopes, you have\nhad it in the long run, and really it is\nyour own fault; you should never have\nlet her father lend you the money for\nthe ring.\nYHA GROUP IN NORTHUMBERLAND\nEASTER 1961\nThree exiled Northumbrians, tired of extolling the virtues of their much maligned\ncountry, decided to visit the homeland in\nthe Easter Vacations. So after much cajoling a mixed party of six from Bedford\nand IC made the trip, though only on one\nday were all six members present together.\nOne young lady, who joined the party a week late arrived wearing an engagement\nring, which caused doubts to be expressed\nabout her excuse of having had measles.\nThe par iy~ set off from Alnwick in a blinding snow storm and after a few derisive remarks and aided by some completely unintelligible directions from a local\nfarmer, made their way to Rock Hostel.\nFortunately the weather improved and the\nnext two days were fairly dry and were\nspent in exploring the coastline northwards as far as Holy Island. I think we\nwill all remember for a long time the impressiveness of Bamburgh Castle, rising\nsheer out of the sand dunes, and flanked\nto the east by a vast expanse of golden\nsands left'clean and smooth by the falling\ntide, and the whole mercifully devoid of\npeople.\nAfter dumping the camping gear used in\nthe first two days, the n arty made its way\nwestwards over the moors to Wooler from\nwhere, after a night's rest at the hostel,\nwe set off into the Cheviot Hills. Luckily\nthe weather was fine and clear, but the\nparty was quickly made to realise tha*\ndistances are vast in the Cheviots and\nthat the lack of cons pi cio us landmarks\nmakes navigation difficult.\nThe summit of the Cheviot was reached\nat about 1.30 p.m. and the party lunched\nby the cairn, completely surrounded by a peat-bog and huge peat-hags. That evening was spent at Wholehope Hostel, one\nof the smallest and most isolated belonging to the Y. H.A., where the party learnt\nsome of the history and traditions of the\nBorder Country from the Warden.\nAfter the first few days time seemed\nto go very quickly and three more days\nof rough walking, in part along the Pennine Way, brought the party to the Roman\nWall, which we then proceeded to patrol\nin true Roman style, walking along the\ntop in a single file. By now we were in\nmore gentle country and were able to admire some of the lovely scenery along\nthe banks of the North and South Tyne\nbefore striking north again across the\nmoors to Rothbury in Coquetdale. From\nhere, those who had not fallen by the wayside departed to their respective homes,\nfeeling perhaps physically tired but all\nthe more able to face the mental rig ours of the Summer Term.\nCRUD FOR PRESIDENT\nThe Editor would like to thank Roger\nHenson, Ian Gibson, Duncan Gardiner and\nour Bedford correspondent, who are largely responsible for this feature.\nThe obvious choice for ne j tt year's president is Crud. This is born out by the\nphotograph of Crud in his \"going to com-mitte e\" stance. This is familiar to, and\nwe l practised by, everyone who has ever\nsat on a committee but note the elegant\nway in which Crud does this; obviously a past-master at it.\nYou have met him in Felix already inviting a boi d to flit into Weeks Bar, this\nfact combined with the fact that he is\na permanent resident of the bar shows\nthat he would make an admirable pre-sident.\nEveryone knows him, or will do when\n'his present Crud \u00a3or President Campaign\nis over, and he knows nobody, again perfect for president.\nAll these virtues and no vices, that is,\nin the purely I.C. sense of the word, po in^ him out as the only possible President.\n\n"
