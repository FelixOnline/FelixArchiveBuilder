    "content": "CUTTERS\nLetters\nDavid's Goliath\nDear Sir,\nI say 'ear! 'ear! to, T Mohammad's letter in\nlast weeks FELIX. The Jewish Society must\nrealise that the state of Israel is very, far from\nbeing the poor, weak, little 'David' that the\nwhole world must feel sorry for. Israel is a 'Goliath' who has trampled under-foot the\nrights to life , liberty and property of its own\nnative population and the citizens of a neighbouring country. Just like the Biblical\nGoliath the Israelis have finally received 'one\nin the eye' from people who have decided to\nstand up for their freedom.\nYours,\nTS Sheriff.\nBlinkered Vision\nDear Sir,\nThank you Mr Mohammad for your letter\nin the last issue of FELIX. Unfortunately I haven't got your talent for propaganda. If I had I could answer you in the same style and\nremind you of Arab cruel and horrifying acts\ntowards Israel, and among themselves for\nthat matter. Quite frankly, Mr Mohammad,\nare you not beginning to be fed up with this\nendless fight?\nIt is true that Lebanon wasn't one of\nIsrael's more successful campaigns and it is\ntrue that civilians were hit during this war.\nUnfortunately every war claims its victims\nfrom the civilian population, as indeed your\nfellow English students will tell you of the\nthousands killed during World War 2 when\nthe RAF bombed Dresden and Hamburg\nwhich were purely civilian targets. I can only\ntell you that we truely tried our best not to\nhurt civilians, and I did not need the TV to see\nthat. If you knew me you'd believe me.\nMr Mohammad, don't you think it is about\ntime that we both grew-up and tried to sit\ntogether instead of killing each other, as we\nhave been doing for the past 50 years? Do you\nnot think that this argument over a piece of\nland of less than the size of Wales has gone on\nlong enough. If not, please write 'Down with\nIsrael' on the walls of the College again , so\nI 'll know.\nYours faithfully,\nGad Aharoni,\nDOC 1.\nRealistic Attitude\nDear Sir,\nI write in support of Mr T Mohammad,\nwhose letter was published in last weeks\nFELIX, concerning the slogan 'Down with\nIsrael!'\nIt is sad that members of the Jewish Society\ncondemn so strongly, relatively harmless\nwords on a wall, without reflecting upon the\nactions of their fellow Jews in Lebanon. I fail\nto understand how they can ignore the daily\nacts of murder and the continuing oppression\nof countless civilians by their armed forces,\nwhen we are constantly reminded of the\nsuffering undergone by the Jews themselves\njust forty years ago.\nIt becomes worrying that the Jewish\npeople do not seem to have learnt from their\npast, and are not at least trying to extend a friendly and peaceful hand to their Lebanese\nneighbour, rather than a fist made from iron.\nYours\nT Ishaq\nPeaceful Discussion\nDear Sir,\nSince the first few words one saw when\nopening FELIX last week were 'Down with\nIsrael', the hooligans can now dispense with\ntheir spray-cans! The title to the letter from T Mohammed does5 their work for them.\nWhile not condoning violence, I do\nacknowledge Israel's right to defend herself\nagainst acts of terrorism. However, it is these\nfurtive acts of senseless vandalism that serve\nonly to promote enmity and distrust between\nJew and Arab, emotions which I, for one,\nhope to see disappear from Imperial College.\nAnd this will only occur through peaceful\ndiscussion of the issues involved.\nYours Sincerely,\nMiss J A Glausiusz,\nChairman, Jewish Society,\nLife Sciences 2.\nHumble Obedience\nDear Sir,\nCould you please remind anyone who was\nissued with a parking permit who is not using\nit any more to return it to the Union Office.\nThis also applies to anyone who will have\nno furthur use for their permit over the\nsummer vacation or after exams.\nThis is important as there are an awful lot\nof people who can make use of underused\npermits.\n/ remain, Sir,\nYour humbly obedient servant,\nEric Darbyshire.\nFELIX\nAccommodation for next year dominates\nconversation among 1st and 2nd years this term, as\nmuch as 'employment prospects pre-occupy\nfinalists.\nSince many students will be forced to seek\naccommodation in the private sector. It seems to\nme that the College and or Union could do a lot\nmore to help.\nAt many universities, for instance, computerised\naccommodation data-bases exist. Students about\nto move out of private flats have details of\nlandlord, location, price etc., put on file. They can\nthen be sorted by price, size, location for the benefit\nof students searching for flats for next year.\nSuch a system would be cheap, immensely useful\nand, for a science and technology College one\nwould have thought, easy to set up.\n'Security' in Southside is a source of endless\nannoyance.\nFirst there was the ASSA lock\u2014occasionally the\ndoor was propped open, but in general things\nweren't too bad.\nThen came the key-card Mark I. You stuck it in a hole, forced it against a spring using both hands,\ntwisted it through several hundred degrees of arc at\nsome danger to your equilibrium and then, panting\nand short of breath, you used both hands and one\nleg to open the door.\nNo wonder it got kicked in every week.\nThen came the key-card Mark II. It's electronic\nso it must be better. One would have thought. But it\nisn't. In fact it's so unreliable and difficult to use that\nthe Selkirk doors are left permanently unlocked.\nA bright red light has thoughtfully been\nprovided by the Estates section. It flashes out,\nbeacon-like across Princes Gardens, as if to say:\n'OK, boys. The doors are open. Everyone\nwelcome.'\nIn fact that's exactly what it does say. It's meant\nto say it to the men whose job it is to watch the TV\nmonitors (there is a camera at each entrance). But\nthey don't seem to take much notice. Otherwise the\nred light wouldn't be left to flash all night, would it?\nThe entire ridiculous system of key cards should\nbe ripped-out and disposed of. It is utterly useless.\nAny suggestions as to what use the red lights\nmight have? Well, you could always screw them to\nthe outside wall and use them to hail taxis, I suppose.\nBy the way. The ASSA locks aren't much good\neither. Doors at both ends of Southside can easily\nbe opened with a pen knife.\nAcknowledgements: Many thanks to Gren,\nRichard, Martin, Debbie, Howard Rudd, John,\nJon, Hugh, Hugh, Luke, Steve Marshall, Judith,\nChris, Alan, Diane, Nigel, Pete, Rosemary and\nTony.\nFelix is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial\nCollege Union Publications Board and is printed by the Union Print\nUnit, Imperial College, Prince Consort Road.

    "content": "Eddie and Pat\nwelcome you to\nthe HOOP and TOY\nOne of South Kensington's finest traditional\nEnglish Free House Pubs with excellent choice\nof beers and home cooked fare at a reasonable price.\ncontinued from page 4\nmainframes. A large part of their\nbusiness comes from users of\nvery large micro s of perhaps 400\nMbyte power. The Ford Cortinas\nof the computing world.\nCFM would not comment,\nhowever, on which types needed\nmost repair.\nIt seemed to us that you just\ncan't write about computers\nwithout talking to IBM. They\ndid, after all, invite us all to their\nExhibit a few month ago. A salesman from another company\nhad this to say:\n'IBM have been in it from the\nstart, and as far as most\ncustomers see it, they will be here\nfor ever'.\nWe tried the number in the\nLondon phone book at 12.45pm. Would you believe\u2014the staff\nof IBM was out to lunch. At\n2.10pm we tried again to find a fast, helpful bunch of people. The\ncorporate mentality looms large,\nhowever. It took three further\ncalls to trace someone who was\nallowed to talk to us. Nothing\nseems to frighten a business man\nfaster than questions about\nabout his marketing policies. Not\nthat IBM's policies are hard to\nguess\u2014they sell everything,\nevery way.\nAt the heavy end of the\nspectrum\u2014multi-million pound\nsystems\u2014IBM have people\nworking with a client's data\npreparation staff on a permanent\nbasis. On this level of\nsophistication, they can be fairly\nconfident of providing any\nreplacement or update because of\nthese very close links.\nMore recently, for smaller\nsystems, dealer networks have\nbeen established. Different\nnetworks deal with different\nproducts. Agencies are awarded\nfor various sizes of computer.\nTheir spokesman's explanation\nof the continuing growth of\ncomputing was down to earth.\nSomeone in this company\nunderstands economics.\n'The main area of growth is\nwith existing customers businesses growing. But market\nsaturation is not really a problem, because the cost of\ncomputing is Deflationary.\nComputing power which, say,\nten years ago would have cost \u00a3 1\nnow costs less than a penny.'\nSo demand grows as the price\nfalls. Simple, isn't it?\n'We don't customise the\nhardware. We tend to produce\ngeneral purpose machines that\nare then customised through\nprogramming. We run our own\ntraining classes for the user's staff, or at a smaller level we\nprovide Self-Tuition diskettes.'\nFor medium-sized firms,\ntraining is often the province of\nindependent 'external education\ncompanies.'\n' We have a range of\nunderstanding among our users.\nThe direction in which we are\ngoing is that the user need not\nunderstand the programming or\nthe workings of the computer.\nSwitch on and just use a diskette.\nHow long do they last?\n'There are machines around\nthat were installed 10 or 15 years\nago, but they are the exception.\nSeveral years, anyway. But what\nwe find is that they are\ntechnically obsolete long before\nthey...are obsolete, if you\nlike...mechanically.'\nIn other words, bugger ed after\nten years, but nobody minds. So\nwe seem to have some advice for\nany budding computer salesmen.\nGo for the first-time buyer, and\ngive lots of advice, training and\nass-licking. That way he will\ncome to you again after a very\nshort time to get updated. First\ncomputer have a point. Allow a realistic budget for training, and\nmake the software VERY easy to\nuse. Read FELIX and make a million\u2014we could take on Fleet\nStreet yet. \u2022\nand FAGINS WINE BAR\nAn Old English Wine Bar with an extensive\nrange of wines and foreign beers, hot and\ncold food including veal in lemon sauce, beef\nbourg ign on, chicken frascati, jacket potatoes\nwith choice of fillings etc etc., lunchtime and\nevening.\nCome along and see us\u2014it's well worth a visit!\n10 Friday 3 May 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS FEATURED\nNUS Conference\n\u2014a tame affair\n\u2022AFTER THE NEWS coverage generated by the riots and\ndisruption of the NUS conference in December, last month's Easter conference was a pretty tame affair.\nThe main issue dominating the\nconference was the refusal of\nSunderland Poly student union\nto recognise an independent\nJewish Society. In an emergency\nmotion the NUS resolved to\nsuspend the membership of\nSunderland Poly Union if it did\nnot reverse its decision within six\nmonths. The issue arises because\nof the strong anti-Zionist feeling\nof some groups on the extreme\nleft, who see Israel as a Zionist\nstate and are therefore opposed\nto Jews who support the right of\nIsrael to exist.\nThe expected disruption from\nfar-right members of the\nFederation of Conservative\nStudents failed to materialize for\nthe most part. A few were present\nat conference but failed to cause\nmore than a ripple of disquiet.\nEven the elections, which it\nappeared would be thrown into\nchaos by the twelve FCS\ncandidates standing for each\npost, went smoothly as all but\ntwo FCS members withdrew.\nThe two who remained were\ntreated as joke candidates, and\nthe hustings passed off in good\nhumour.\nThe reason for the lack of\ndisruption does not stem from\nany change of policy or\nleadership in FCS, but largely\nfrom pressure from the\nConservative party on FCS to\nend the tactics which brought\nConservatives such bad publicity\nat the Christmas conference. As\nwidely reported in the national\npress, the party is currently\ninvestigating the affairs of FCS\nfollowing their Loughborough\nconference.\nThe other issue to raise itself\nthroughout the conference was\nthe Welsh language. Delegates\nfrom Welsh colleges protested\nthat the NUS was not translating\nall its publications into Welsh,\nmaking them useless to some\nWelsh unions who have policy\nonly allowing them to distribute\nleaflets or display posters if they\nare available in both English and\nWelsh. A demonstration at one\nstage involved a large number of\nbin-liners full of NUS pub l cations being dumped in\nfront of the platform. The NUS is\nnow to examine the setting up of\na London based translation\nservice after a motion of censure\nwas passed on the Executive.\nElections\nThe National Organisation of\nLabour Students (NOLS)\nretained control of the NUS\nExecutive for the coming year,\ntheir fourth year in overall\ncontrol. There were signs,\nhowever, of a resurgence in\nstrength of their main\nopposition, the non-party Left\nAlliance. NOLS and the LA only\nstood against each other in the\nelection for one of the five full-time (sabbatical) posts, that of\nVice President Education, when\nthe LA candidate, Andy Whyte,\nnarrowly defeated his NOLS\nopponent. Three of the four\nremaining full time posts,\nincluding that of President Phil\nWoolas, were won by the\nincumbent standing for a second\n(and final) term, without serious\nopposition. The real contest will\ncome next year with both sides\nputting up new candidates for the\nmain positions.\nIn the elections for part time\nmembers, a new factor was the\nemergence of credible independent candidates from the Further\nEducation sector of NUS, two of\nwhom were elected. This year for\nthe first time in many years no\nConservative was elected, but\none Social Democrat was\nsuccessful. The overall control of\nthe Executive remains with\nLabour, but their position looks\nless unshakeable than it did last\nyear.\nMotions\nThe Easter conference has a large\npart of its business s devoted to\nmotions. Unlike the last\nconference, where the Miners\nstrike dominated, there were not\npolicy debates of any great\ncontroversy. The priorities ballot\nturned up Sexual Politics (ie gay\nrights) as the first topic for debate\nselected by the constituent\nmembers, with Local Government (abolition of the GLC, rate\ncapping, etc.) and Internationalism being chosen by the\nExecutive.\nFirst there were several\nsignificant constitutional\nmotions. The move to end\nindividual membership, passed\nat Christmas, was ratified and\nnow becomes effective. A new\nclause was introduced to the\nstanding orders to allow the\nremoval of delegates from\nconference for violent attacks.\nThe composition of the\nExecutive is to be changed also,\nwith a full-time Further\nEducation Officer, and a Women's Officer (although the\nexact status of this post still needs\nfurther consideration). The\ntwelve part time members\npresently elected by STV in\ngroups of 3, 4 and 5 will now be\nelected in two groups of 7 and 5.\nThis may affect the political\nbalance of the Executive slightly\nbut this remains to be seen next\nEaster.\nThe Local Government\nmotion resulted in a predictable\npro-GLC, anti-rate capping\nposition. The more extreme\nposition supporting Councils\nrefusing to set a legal rate was\ndefeated. 'Internationalism'\ncontained all that is worst in the\nirrelevant politic king of NUS\nconferences. It set out to define\nwhich side the NUS should be on\nin international conflicts, with\nwhich groups it should set up\nfraternal links, etc. An\namendment saying that NUS\nshould not have anything to do\nwith such things but should be\nworking for the benefit of its\nmembers was easily defeated. So\ntoo was the amendment calling\nfor workers and students to unite\nin the coming proletarian\nuprising of the oppressed in\nsociety to create a new world\norder where those scourges of the\ncapitalist system hunger, disease,\nrate capping, etc, etc. would be\nbanished and we'd all go around\nbeing nice to each other.\nThis was followed by the\nSexual Politics debate, again with\na predictable outcome. The next\ndebate, on Subscriptions, was\ninteresting because it showed\nthat many unions are feeling the\npinch when it comes to NUS\naffiliation fees. The resulting\npolicy means that fees may not go\nup as quickly as inflation in\nfuture years.\nThe remaining debates were\nAid to the Third World\n(Ethiopia, etc), Racism and\nFascism (they're against them),\nand the Youth Training Scheme.\nIn each motion there are clearly\nidentifiable political positions\ncontained in the various\namendments. The main motion is\nbland, amendment one is the\nNOLS position, amendment two\nand three may be the Militant\nand Socialist Workers positions,\nwith amendment four being\nperhaps a moderate Conservative position. Usually only\namendment one is passed!\nIronically given the claimed\nattack on education by the\nGovernment, the NUS did not\nseem able to come up with\nanything of much substance to\ndebate. Perhaps this is a symptom of having two big\nconferences with a large amount\nof time devoted to policy\ndebates\u2014there is simply too\nmuch time to find enough\nworthwhile debates to fill the\nspace, resulting in a lot of sterile\nposturing rather than real\ndiscussion.\u2022\nPhil Woolas, NUS President, gives his key-note address to conference\nFELIX Friday 3 May 1985 5\n\n"

    "content": "SINGLES\nGary Moore/Phil Lynott:\nMilitary Man\nIt's good to hear the great\nLynott' s vocals chords straining into action again,\nand fortunately for all fans of\nhis brand of hard rock, Gary\nMoore has produced an\nexcellent track for him.\nThundering electric guitar\nwork as you expect, but a good song nevertheless.\nLa Bouche: Romantic Love\nNow this is very odd. Every\nsound on the single, is\nproduced by digital synthesis\nof the human voice which\nresults in a disco Two Tribes\nstyle feel, but with Romantic\nLove choruses more reminiscent of a kiddie choir.\nIrritatingly catchy this could\nbe a surprise hit.\nDepeche Mode: Shake The\nDisease\nThey've been having a little\ntrouble maintaining their\npopularity recently, and I suspect this track will do little\nto help that situation. They\nsound more and more like the\nlate 70's band they are, and\nseem to have lost the\nexcitement and originality of\ntheir early songs. It's a pity.\nPaul Hardcastle: 19\nPeople have criticised Paul\nfor making a commer ical success out of the tragedy\nthat was Vietnam. Certainly\nlistening to the electro funk of\n\u2022 this single grates rather\nagainst the photos we've all\nseen of the youngsters in\nSaigon during the war.\nHowever anything that reminds me of such images\ncan't be all bad\u2014and it is a great track.\nOne The Juggler: Hours And\nHours\nJohn Peel's favourite band,\nnow recording for RCA, sounds remarkably amateur\non this. The song is weak with\na Eurovision tune and oom-pa\ndrum beat. Even the pianist is\nout of time with the rest of the\nband. There is no room for\ntrash like this in my collection.\nEurythmics: Would I Lie To\nYou?\nI believe there will be a new\nalbum coming out soon and\njudging from this, it will have\nbeen well worth the wait since\nTouch. Annie Lennox's voice\ncan only be described as\nremarkable, and Dave Stewart' s songwriting abilities, ranging from the last\nballad Julia to this MONSTER rock smash, are incredible.\nBrilliant.\nCINEMA . . . . .\nHarvey Milk\nEveryman, Hampstead/26 April\nWhat do people really know about 'Gays'. There are the scary\nones that parade their moustaches and tight leather at Earls\nCourt or swing their hand bags under the arches at Heaven, but\nwho are the 'normal' homosexuals? Were you ever taught by\none? Perhaps theres one reading this review thinking\u2014that's not what it's like...\nHarvey Milk was a gay activist, a normal, friendly guy, well\nliked. He owned a camera store in Castro San Fransisco and\nbecame one of the city's most influential elected officials. He\nwas outspoken and a prominent leader in the Gay Rights\nmovement and was behind many of its success ses. \u2022\nThe film The Times of Harvey Milk follows his life and rise to\ncity supervisor\u2014well liked and respected throughout many\nwalks of the population. Well out of the closet and into the street\nwhen a fellow city supervisor shot both Milk and the city Mayor,\nGeorge Moscome, at their offices in city hall. The documentary\nthen follows the ridiculous trial of Dan White, the murderer,\nwhose comic defence successfully employed arguments such\nas 'bad health' and 'too much fast food' to keep nis sentence to a minimum.\nA thought provoking, yet very conventional, 1.5 hour\ndocumentary released as a film. Perhaps too long. It would have\nmade a good 'Arena' or '40 Minutes' but as a film, it is aimed at\nrather a minority viewing. Other sectors of society are hardly\nencouraged to go with such an interesting yet perhaps\nuninviting subject.\nCINEMA\nThe\nreturn of\nCaptain\nInvincible\nThe whole film is a send up of\nthose sickly American superheroes and tells the tale\nof one such character who,\nhaving been purged during\nthe McCarthy period (for\nwearing a red cape, flying\nwithout a pilot's licence and\nwearing underwear in public)\nbecomes a wino in Australia.\nHowever when the evil Dr\nMidnight (ably played by\nPeter Cushing) threatens to\nrid New York of its ethnic\npopulation by means of a spectacularly xenophobic scheme the president of the\nUnited States calls on his\nchildhood hero Captain Invincible (in the form of Alan\nArkin) to save the day.\nThe film follows the Captain's rehabilitation and\nhis race against time to meet\nup with his old arch enemy Dr\nMidnight, climaxing with a remarkably silly good against\nevil confrontation.\nGasp at the attack of the\nkiller vacuum cleaners, gap at\nthe President singing the\nword 'bullshit' for 45 seconds,\nlust after the (female) CIA\nagents and become confused\nas to just where Dr Midnight's sidekick fits in.\nThe script is punctuated by\nsongs from the pens of\nRichard Hartley and Richard\nO' Brien( both of ' Rocky Horror Show' fame) whose\nin ap prop riat ness is only matched by their farcical\ndelivery and lyrical content.\nOJ Oo w25'S= CD<T> tt> CO\n^ 3 \u2022 CD m zl\n5*3 m3O cr\nCD DCD TD\nCD O3\"CD On a technical level the film\nholds up very well, especially\nthe early stage-setting portion\nwhich includes some spoor\n'News on the March' 50's newsreels and an excellent\nMcCarthy inquisition courtroom scene which is so good\nas to be wholly believable.\nThe special effects, whilst\nnothing spectacular, enable\nthe film to carry on without\nbelief having to be suspended\nmore than is necessary in the\nfirst place, and in fact the very\nlack of polish on these areas\nadds to the amateurish charm\nof this highly original film.\nIf you have ever read a Marvel comic, or played a super heroes game then this\nfilm is a must for you.\nOtherwise just go along to\nlaugh at this lampoon of the\nAmerican mentality and rejoice in the knowledge that\nwe British would never fall\ninto this same superhero trap.\n( Who mentioned King Arthur?).\nFELIX Friday 3 May 1985 13\n\n"

    "content": "HAND... \u2022MEWS REV1EW_\n\u2022WELL, AFTER THIRTY hours work it runs. This term's computer project. God rot its one-megahertz soul, who would use\none of these out of choice?\nNot a bad question, you may think, follow it up. So we did.\nThe small business market\nseemed a good example to look\nat, so we dusted off the Yellow\nPages, and let our fingers do the\nwalking. Where first? First\nComputer\u2014the name says it all.\nThis company was set-up in\nFebruary of last year to cater,\nusually for the first-time buyer in\nthe small business sector. They\ncap also provide systems for the\ncorporate user.\nAlthough they operate from\nshop-fronted premises their\nspokesman emphasised that they\nsell 'service not boxes'.\nThey aim to provide a complete package \u2014 from\nsystems consultancy to operator\ntraining and machine main ten ance. 'Home Computers?'. We\nasked. 'Definitely not,' they\nreplied. Tired of silly questions\nabout space invaders, I expect.\nHowever, they will tolerate silly\nquestions about more lucrative\nproblems because they offer\nimmediate assistance to clients\non a telephone help line.\nClaiming to provide tailored\nsystems for all clients, they would\nnot be drawn by requests for a typical system. 'But don't you get\nto the point where every business\nthat wants a computer already\nhas one?'. 'No,' they said, 'that' a long way off.' Apparently, users\nare often expanding business\nrequiring updated systems on a regular basis. Quite how they can\nbe so sure of this on the basis of\neighteen months' trading I don't know. But there was no\nhesitation at the other end of the\nphone. The coming thing is\nmulti-user networking, and they\ndon't expect to be short of orders.\nMulti what? Don't panic, at IC\nwe've had it for years. The\nCollege mainframe operates\nhundreds of terminals. Now the\nbigger micro systems can handle\nit, too. Whoopee, let's go and buy\none.\nTo save their blushes, I won't name the next firm we contacted,\nbecause some of the things they\nsaid were that, um, frank.\n'Sell Computers? Well, yes we\ndid, but we're getting out of that\nside of the business now.'\nAha. This sounds interesting.\n'You see, we had a dealership\nfor XXX XXX computers, ,but\nthey're having trouble and now\nthey've pulled out. We did get an\noffer of another dealership but...\n'The problem is this. In a small\naccounts department, the level of\nstaff is such that with all the\nback-up and training and\nthe...(whither ing sign)...hand-holding it was much too\nexpensive. We only have a30 per\ncent mark-up and if you are\ntalking about, maybe \u00a34000 for\nan account g system, it just can't be done.'.\nSo there are problems with the\nusers' understanding?\n'You're telling me. The kind of\npeople we're dealing with,\nthey're a real bag of worms. With\nthe education these days, they\ncan hardly read and write, some\nof them, never mind electronic\ngenius!'.\nThis is not necessarily a criticism of youth, though:\n'And the older book-keepers,\nthey get set in their ways. You go\nback to an office six months or a year after installing a system, and\nfind all this expensive hardware\nsitting there doing nothing. The\nblok e is back to writing on the\nback of envelopes.'\nAsked about market satu rat ion, this firm unwittingly\nilluminated the rationale behind\nFirst Computer's 'be nice to\nbeginners' policy.\n'Yes, you certainly do get that\nproblem. The large firms with all\nthe resources have had systems\nfor year. If they want an updated\none, they've already got their\nsupplier.'\nDiversity is a problem, too. It\nseems that users are confused by\nthe sheer number of models on\nthe market. About 100\nmanufacturers of micro s are in\noperation, all filling the corners \u2022\nof someone's office, and some\nclaiming rather more than they\nshould about their machines\ncapability.\n'Some people come in here\nasking if they can do their\naccounts on a XXXX X, which\ncost \u00a3200. Some of them realise\nthat it can cost a lot more.\nSo we have two views of\nretailing. They are different, but\npatterns are starting to emerge.\nWhat about reliability? We\ncontacted Computer Field\nMaintenance to see if there might\nbe other chilly patches amid the\nwhite heat of technology. Relax.\nThey weren't worried.\nBasically, electronics last for\never. Even the maintenance for\nelect o mechanical components is\nreducing. Even for printers, the\nmanufacturers say 'no routine\nmaintenance.' We just give 'em a clean and a shampoo if we're\ncalled out to deal with faults.\nWinchester disks, for instance,\nare practically ...well, no they are\nmaintenance free'.\nReassuring. How long does a machine last?\n'Six months to 10 years. Not\nbecause it's broken, no. That's about how long it takes for a company to want to expand or\nupdate their system'\nEssentially, CFM provide an\ninsurance against breakdown.\nThey are retained by clients on a contract basis, and will then\nresponsibility for the running of\nthe system. Either labour-only or\nfully comprehensive contracts\nare available, the latter being\nmore usual. They will tailor a contract to a customer's system\nand insurance requirements,\nalthough if you spill coffee over a machine or kick it to death\n(amounts to the same thing) you\nwill probably have to pick up the\nbill yourself.\nThey are called to deal with all\ntypes of machines from PCs to\ncontinued on page 10\nJ/ l foe rym In the United States, a woman\nput her pet poodle in a microwave\noven to dry it's coat. After a few\nseconds the microwaves were so\nintense that the dog exploded. As\nnowhere on the oven did it state\nthat pets were not to be put inside\nshe successfully sued the oven\nmanufacturers for compensation.\nSince then, all microwave ovens\nsold in the US have had big sticky\nlabels stating that they are not to\nbe used for drying pets.\nThis never happened.\nApocryphal stories such as\nthis, passed across smoked filled\nbars, are the direct descendants\nof Beowulf and other folk\nlegends. They are usually\ngruesome, moral, and the teller\nusually claims some personal\ncorroboration; it happened to a friend of an uncle, or they read it\nin a newspaper (So it must be\ntrue).\nFELIX rang Toshiba,\ncurrently having great success\nwith their range of microwave\novens backed by a big advertising\ncampaign. Had they heard the\nstory? 'Yes'. And is it true? 'No.\nThere is no recorded instance of a dog being put in a microwave\noven'. Well, do microwave ovens\nsold in the United States have a big sticker on them saying that\npets are not to be dried in them?\nUnfortunately Toshiba didn't think so, but they weren't sure, so\nFELIX asked an American\nstudent who just happened to be\npassing the office. She didn't know for sure either, but she was\nsure that a woman was suing a microwave manufacturer\nbecause she had put her pet\npoodle in a microwave oven\nand....\n4 Friday 3 May 1985 FELIX\n\n"

The landlords who own the\nflats want to raise the rent, which means that students may be\nasked to pay up to \u00a335 for a double room, an increase of nearly\n50%.\nIf the College, who are Head Tenants of Hamlet Gardens, feel that\nstudents would be unwilling to pay more, they may give up the flats.\nNegotiations are in progress between the College and the landlord to\nfix ten a cy charges for next year. The College are the Head Tenants\nwho are responsible for collecting rent from students and paying the\nlandlord. Head Tenancies are designed to break even and any subsidy\nwould be out of the question, so will have to be passed on directly to\nthe students. Charges at present are about \u00a322-\u00a324 for rent only, and\ngas and electricity bills must be paid separately. Hamlet Gardens\nno uses over 200 students and unless College can be sure of breaking\neven, they may be forced to discontinue the tenancy.\nStudent Services Officer Michael Arthur has said that he will write\nto applicants for Hamlet Gardens flats to inform them of the likely\nsituation.\n'Clearly no student is going to be forced to live there against this\nwill, if he feels that the rent is too high.'\nMr Arthur went on to explain that he foresaw a drift away from\nlarge head tenancies towards small company let schemes.\nJolly good Fellows\nSEVERAL EX-IC STUDENTS\nand a former Home Secretary are\namong the six newly elected\nFellows of Imperial College.\nProfessor J Sutton was at\nCollege from 1937-41 and\nreturned to the Department of\nGeology after the war. This is\nwhere he remained for thirty-five\nyears before being appointed as\nthe first Director and Emeritus\nProfessor in the Centre for\nEnvironmental Technology.\nAnother new Fellow, Mr John\nEgan, was a member of the RS M from 1958-61, and is currently\nChairman and Chief Executive of\nJaguar Cars. Mr HM Neal,\nChairman of the City and Guilds\nof London Institute was also a student in the City and Guilds\nCollege and is a Governor.\nAnother Governor, and Chairman of Prudential Insurance is the Rt Hon Lord\nCarr of Hadley who was Home\nSecretry from 1972-74. An ex-lecturer and authority on\naeronautical structures, Professor J H Argyris was also\nelected together with Professor\nRandolph Quirk, Vice Chancellor of London University.\nAUTpay\nconflict\nTHE ASSOCIATION OF\nUniversity Teachers (AUT) may\nurge lecturers to with old examination results or take strike\naction following an offer of a4% pay increase from the\nGovernment. The AUT have\ndismissed this rise as derisory and\nare seeking an interim increase of\n7/2%. They also want an\nindependent commission of\nenquiry to examine lecturer's pay. The Committee of Vice\nChancellors and Principals\n(CVCP) have refused to assist the\nAUT in any further pay\nnegotiations with the Government, until this year's claim is\nsettled.\nProfessor Leppington of the\nImperial Gollege AUT said that it\nwas premature to speak of\nindustrial action. He said that\neven if the AUT National\nExecutive recommended action,\nthe final decision would rest with\nthe local branch.\nCard\ntrick\nBRITISH RAIL FARES are to be\nrestructured from May 12th with a major change involving use of\nstudent rail cards. They will only entitle holders\nto one-third off their fare instead\nof one-half. The one-third\nreduction will be extended to\nsaver tickets. These will become\nthe normal tickets replacing\nweekend returns and away days with white days and blue days.\nOn white days (Friday and\nSummer Saturdays and Sundays\nplus the odd Thursday) savers\nwill be more expensive than on\nblue days (the rest) but rail card holders will receive a full one-third off both fares. The standard\nticket will only be necessary for a return journey more than one\nmonth after the date of issue.\nFree! Friday 3 May 1985 No 702\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nPHOTO\nHere are the results of the magnificent Photosoc FELIX\ncompetition. All you avid readers of this column should\nknow all about it, because it has been mentioned in\nalmost every Photosoc article and newsletter since\nbefore Christmas. Just in case you don't, though, here is\na quick recap.\nEach entry for the competition was a portfolio of up to four prints,\nB& W or colour, of any size and of varied subject matter. The main\ncriterion for judging was to have been visual composition, rather than\nprint quality. The first prize is a \u00a310 voucher to buy photographic\nequipment from Jessops, and the two runners up get \u00a35 Jessops\nvouchers. The entire winning portfolio is printed in these pages,\ntogether with one print from each of the runners up. The competition\nwas judged by that well know art critic Mr Dave Rowe, with a little\nhelp from Nigel Atkinson. Altogether we had seven entries, which just\ngoes to show what can be achieved by continually putting back the\ndeadline! The winning portfolio was submitted by Sigrun Eriksen a Chemistry PG. The two runners up are Chris Jones, a Chemistry RA and Richard Lewis, another Chemistry PG. The committee would\nlike to thank the other people who bothered to enter ie Johann Riedel,\nNick Horton, Sarah Butler and myself. The prints will be returned to\ntheir owners either personally or via the internal mail. Prizes can be\ncollected at any Photosoc committee meeting.\nThe winning portfolio was chosen, despite what was said above,\nmainly be cu as je of its excellent print quality although the pictures of\nthe brick staircase and of the small child are also striking\ncompositions. The head and shoulders portrait can really only be best\nappreciated by looking at the original print, from which it is apparent\nthat professional lighting equipment has been used. The fourth shot,\nthat of a nude man is best not mentioned at all, except to deny all\nresponsibility.\nThe print quality in Chris Jones's entry was also first class. This set\nincluded a close up of a daffodil, a landscape, a photograph of a farmhouse and the dead brilliant one of a young man blowing his nose\nwhich is reproduced here (the print, not the nose).\nAll but two of the portfolios consisted of 8\" x10\" hand printed B& W prints. The others were postcard sized colour prints done by\nprofessional laboratories. The Judge thought that one of these ought\nto be among the winners, and so the second runner up is Richard\nLewis. Among his portfolio were pictures of a Hippopotamus, a dried\nfruit, a tree and the Albert Bridge. The one of the Albert Bridge is also\nprinted here. Among those who didn't win, Nick Horton's portfolio\nwas particularly good.\nOn the principle that no publicity is bad publicity, I think that this\ncompetition could be judged a success, but if we are to hold another\none next year then we must have more entries than this. We are\nseriously considering making it compulsory.\nPhoto: Sigrun Eriksen Photo: Sigrun Eriksen\nPhoto: Chris Jones\nPhoto: Sigrun Eriksen\nPhoto: Richard Lewis\n8 Friday 3 May 1985 9\n\n"

    "content": "Water, water\neverywhere\nA slow sand filter tank with storage tanks in the distance\nThe photographs were taken by Nigel Graham when he went to\nSomalia to see how the systems behaved in the field.\nThe water distribution unit\n\u2022RELIEF FOR REFUGEES in areas such as Nicaragua,\nHonduras, Ethiopia and the Sudan is being provided by a new\nwater supply system developed at Imperial College. Our science\ncorrespondent investigates...\nIn spite of improvements in sanitation, health care and food\nsupplies, the overall wellbeing of refugees is heavily dependent on the\nadequacy and quality of the water supply. As people entering refugee\ncamps are often undernourished and weak, the dangers of sickness\nand death from polluted drinking water are greatly increased. ,\nIn emergency situations pre-planning and preparation of\nequipment and materials is essential for rapid establishment of safe\nwater supplies. With these needs in mind, Oxfam and Dr Nigel\nGraham of the Civil Engineering Department at Imperial College are\ncollaborating on a project to research, design and develop a water\nsupply system.\nGreat flexibility is needed for the system to be adaptable to the\nvaried requirements of different areas, and this is achieved throught\nthe use of interchangeable units. So far four principal units have been\ndesigned and made: a piped distribution unit, a storage unit, a pumping unit, and a treatment system. The treatment system makes\nuse of a sand filter unit to remove\nmicrobial and physical, contaminants from the water.\nThe research is currently\naimed at finding suitable\ntechniques to abstract groundwater. It is likely that the\nfinal water supply system may\nhave as many as nine units, and it\nwill be able to use water from\nmany different sources such as\nrivers, lakes, wells or springs.\nEach unit is self-contained,\nand a stock is kept in a disaster\nstore ready for rapid transportation overseas. Every system is\ndesigned to cater for 5,000 people\nassuming a minimum consumption per head of 23 litres a day.\nWith this knowledge of the\ncapacity and capability of each\nunit, rapid decisions are possible\nas to which units are needed in an\narea. The combination of units\nrequired will depend on the type\nof local water source and the\nnumber of people in the camp.\nThe design of the units allows\nrapid transportation and easy installation, with the materials used\nchosen for cheapness, reliability and simplicity. Only two to three days\nare needed to set up the storage and distribution units, but the\ntreatment system may need a few weeks before it is fully operational.\nDuring this period, water may be transported from urban supplies to\nthe storage tanks, if possible. The very low cost of the systems, at\naround \u00a33 per head, means that relief agencies are able to provide\nmuch more with the limited resources they have available. Also very\nfew demands are made on the availability of local materials, with only\ndiesel/petrol for powering pumps, and sand and gravel for the\ntreatment unit being required. As refugee camps should only be a temporary measure, the fact that the units can be easily taken apart\nand re-erected elsewhere is very important.\nSince 1981, Oxfam have installed storage and distribution units at\nrefugee camps in Nicaragua, Honduras, and the Sudan. In Somalia\ntreatment units are being used by The Ecumenical Relief and\nDevelopment Group for Somalia, while for the current relief\noperations in Ethiopia, Oxfam are using the storage units. Oxfam feel\nthat in the future these systems may be used in urban squatter areas\nand for rural villages in the third world.\nThe ready availability of pre-planned and developed water supply\nequipment, will help to save time, money and most important of all\nhuman lives, in emergency situations. \u2022\nFELIX Friday 3 May 1985 7\n\n"
