Yours etc. Fresher, maj.\nDear Fresher, maj.,\nFelix it at ions. We\nhope you deserve this. Your st nul y, Editor W. POLITICAL SOCIETY ACTIVITY.\nSir, In numerous past issues of ' Felix' many have\nbeen the letters lamenting the lack of interest in Union activities. Never has this been truer than in the Political Society, whose meetings are usually deplorably attended. The World Situation is extremely tense at t this moment; yet on the eve of the General Election only27 people (out of about 1500)\ncould summon enough interest to attend the 'Mock\nElection' on Jion. 22nd October. It cannot be claimed that this was due to lack of candidates since Socialist, Liberal and Conservative had all been\nnominated and others were welcome also to stand. This is a really tragic state, are we to leave this College to serve as mere technicians, content to let others govern the creation of our brains for their profit? Or are we going to make an effort to understand the issues in the World today. Yours truly, B. Bowes.\n(Hon. Sec. Soc. Group.)\n(N.B. But an evening meeting of this type should never expect the attendance it could get at midday;'\nthe result Soc.18,Lib.4,Con.3- differs\" from the figure of the following Thursday- Ed.)\nAN I.C. WAR-CRY.\nSir As far as I remember I.C. have never had a war cry worthy of our name. In the past when we have\nneeded one the initial s\"I.C.3. and T.\" were made to serve the purpose. This wasn'ta bad effort but it certainly wasn't as.good as one would expect from a great college such as our own. Recently even this has been contracted to the reiteration of \" I. C.I.C.I. C....\" This has the advantages of simplicity but ones' amusement at the more unexpected misinterpretations of our efforts is occasionally tempered\nby other thoughts. One hardly approves of the answer-ing shout of \"We have their cement, it's terrible\" as we heard on Election night. I suggest that we would do better to devise a good, simple and intelligible cry, one which would\ngive plenty of opportunity for a good shout for our\ncollege, and perhaps a smaller one for the constituent colleges too.

    "content": "FELIX RIDING\nToe. Imperial College Riding Club to la year is a most flourishing organisation, there\n\u201e\u201eing at the moment a total of fifteen members.\nThis is a very gratifying state of affairs, and,\nindeed, is adequate exemplification of the\nvaliant spirit abroad in I.C. to-day. For, after all, the horse is a huge, hard, high,\nanimal with teeth and hooves that from leading\ndistance appear of monstrous proportions.t This,\nhowever, has not daunted the 1951 fresher s who\nare, for the most part, beginners and nor should\nit, for I. Cf. Riding Club has always been proud\nOf its low death rate.\nThere appear to be two things which normally deter beginners from taking up riding( apart from lack of a horse). One is the\nexpense of riding equipment, the other is the\nsmall matter of personal comfort. The first does not apply since at the I.C. Riding Club\nno equipment is required. Naturally, a stout\npair of breeches helps considerably in the\nretention of one's ability to walk but ( like walking) this is not essential. The second?\nWell, there is absolutely no discomfort in rid ing. The discomfort comes in learning to ride. And even after one's first ride, a cold bath\nand violent exercises for three quarters of an\nhour the next morning will leave no after-effects.\nOr practically none.\nThe periodicity of rides at the moment is phenomenal, the average approaching bi-weekly.\nThis will not be maintained since as the year\nwears on, the imminence of exams and the gene-ral downward trend of bank balances will apply\na glut te brake. Nevertheless, the Riding Club\nis able to offer at frequent intervals a most\npleasant open-air afternoon amid some of the\nfinest country around London.\nClub rides are every Wednesday and Saturday. BOXING Some good boxing was seen at the i.C. Boxing\nClub Novices competition held in the Gymnasium at5.45 p.m. on Thursday, November 1 st, and all who\ntook part are to be commended on their performance.\nThis year the competition was run on an Inter College basis, but showed a deplorable la tik of support from the Guilds as the following result shows:-R.S. M33 points R.C.S.18 point sC&G3 points It is. to be hoped that we shall see some Guildsmen\nin the ring when we hold the I.C. Inter Cole ge Championships in March.\nNOT SO TIGHT? M ORG AT RO^D!

London Hospital.\nThis race, run at Hampstead over 5\u00a3 miles of\nheavy, hilly going, in pouring rain, was the club's first real test of the season. A very strong team\nwas fielded, including four from the University 1st team. The result was a very convincing win for I.C. who packed their entire team of eight in the first thirteen home.\nResult:1st: Chrssty, (L.H.)32 mins. 34 sees.\n2nd: F.

Slov.ly he realises that what defeats him each\ntime is team work, in which ea.ch member of the team\nadds his share, keeping the ball just out of reach\nof the opposition, passing f^ om one to another ,\nuntil the breach in the defence is wide enough for\nanother score. The success of I.C. teams is due to the practice\n,of teamwork, although s^ll far from perfect, rather sooner than most of their opponents. Each game sees\neleven or fifteen men, as the case may be, welded\nmore solidly together, each man becoming an integral\n:\npart of the team, an intelligent and highly adaptable member of an attacking mechanism. The effect is not to reduce the team,aS'^in ay be feared4 to the\nmediocrity of the least able member, but to ensure\na stable and reliable support for the greater\ndexterity of the more able members. No individual\nplay that does not lead to the gain of ground and\nfore ward motion of the team can be anything but a(; discredit to the performer, and detraction from\nenjoyment in the game. Enjoyment of the game should\ny be before and after all, the purpose of playing,\nindividual fitness and ability welded in teamwork\nbeing the most important means to the end.\nPublished by the FELIX Board, Imperial College Union,' London, S.W.7.

    "content": "FE LI X SATURDAY HOPS\nHOPPING & CHANGING.\nThe essential feature of a 'hop' is its informality. Some of this has already been destroyed by\nthe introduction of the ticket system for the guests\nof the Union, but this has not worried us a great deal, as the hops are primarily for the benefit of\nI.C. Union members. Of far greater importance is the necessity of a rigorous check on the Union door\nto make the system work, but this, we realise, is a thoroughly unpopular measure. Moreover it has still proved impossible to keep away uninvited girls... they all find men from I.C. who are ready to introduce them to the Union as personal guests, even after they have been turned away five minutes earlier.. It is not surprising that the dancing space is somewhat overcrowded!\nIt would be possible to arrange for more men\nto be on duty, to impose a rigorous check, to be\nmore careful, cautious and cold hearted with' guests\non the Union door, or even to put out a \"House\nFull\" notice when the capacity of the upper floor is reached, but these measures would destroy more\nof the hop atmosphere. The solution, we feel, is not to be found along those lines. To be quite candid, we have not found a solution, but I.C. Council have given permission for the Entertainments Committee to run an EXPERIMENTAL all ticket hop on November 24th, at which the check on Union\ncards will be unnecessary. We hope that a little of the old friendly atmosphere will return, at the\nexpense of asking everyone to buy their tickets in advance. Tickets for Union members and their guests will be on sale on Thursday and Friday, November 22nd. and 2i rd., from the Union office annex during the lunch hour.\nPaul G.

Waiting for the operating moment, I recapitulated all details of the operation in my\nmind, wondering whether I should be able to\nfind all the different eye muscles, and the\nright place to cut the optic nerve. Slowly\nbut surely Hall gren put the patient into deeper\nunconsciousness, and my operating knife made\nthe first cut in r> circle around the eye pupil. Roots assisted swiftly and coolly. Sch y tt handed the instruments in perfect routine. Rogstad followed the patient's blood pressure. Tne meteorologist, Goesta Lil j equ'is t, kept a record and pressure of the pulse curve. I found the first eye muscle, and palled it easily forthwith my Kaudheim-made instruments. Soon\nall the eye muscles were cut. The most drama-tic moment arrived when I felt for the optic nerve, the only sound being the clicking from\nthe film camera in the background. Successf ull y severing the nerve, I then extracted the\neye globe and tied the eye muscles together, closing the wound with con jun c tib le membrane. i he operation was successfully over after an exciting two hours and forty minutes.\nEverybody congratulated me, but for me the\nmost important part was still left, namely, to\nsee the patient safely through the postoperative stage. At night, the alarmingly mounting pulse\nwas checked by injection, and next day a tired but happy patient received the whole base at a bedside party; his left good eye was now safe. Rcece is now on a sledge journey in the best of\nhealth.\nCOMING EVENTS\nFASHION AND ARCHITECTURE\nOn Tuesday, Dec. 4 th, Prof. Madge\nGarland will be speaking under the heading\" Fashion and Architecture\" at the Royal College\nof Art,21 Cromwell Road. There will also be\nexhibitions of Visiting Card Cases and of Dog\nCollars. The exhibition will open at6.30 and\nthe lecture will begin at7.0p. m.i cfs The film show on Sunday, Nov 11th, will consist of \"Man of Aran\" - '\"Liberty'sf a j nous documentary,\ntwo Czech puppet films starring \"Mr. Prokouk\" and\na film on town planning in America.\nMembers need not obtain tickets in advance, but\nGuest tickets should be bought in the Old Lounge\njust before the performance.\nMUSIC SOCIETY\nOn Thursday evening, November 22nd, at 5.30\np.m. in the C. and G. Council Room, the I.C. orchestra will perform the Symphony No. 40 inG Minor by Mozart and the Overture to Corio l anus by Bee th oven.

This will be the first public appearance of\nthe orchestra since it took part with the choir last Christmas in a performance of Handel'sAc is and Galatea. All members of I.e. and their friends will be\nwelcome. No tickets are required, and there will be no collection. After the concert there will be an informal musical party with refreshments for Members of the\nMusical Society and their friends. It will assist in the catering if those intending to come to the\nparty let one of the officers of the Musical Society know in advance.\nTHURSDAY CONCERT\nOn Thursday 15 Nov. at1.15 in the Council Room of the City and Guilds College, the lunch hour recital will be given by Miss Patricia Andrew (soprano) and Miss Pamela Preston( oboe).\nThe programme will include an oboe concerto by\nPergolesi, songs by Mozart, Warlock and Delius, and two arias by Bach for soprano and continuo\nwith oboe ob liga to.

(an unprintable delicacy) his age compares favourably with those of\nsome senior students\nA supporter of the\nDark Blues, Deryck\nalways ventures forth to witness the yearly battle with Cambridge\nat Twickenham and even\nmanages to find some\nexcuse for their failure in the Boat Race,\nOn attaining his M.A.in Mathematics, Deryck\nforsook his native pastures in Yorkshire to apply his' knowledge to the benefit of Rolls Royce in Derby. He is now the proud possessor of two cars, but alas although the sun still shines his standards have deteriorated since those plutocratic days. Oxford apparently still held a great,\nattraction so he returned there for a further two\nyears to learn to \"Relax\" under the leadership of\nSir Richard Southwell, with whom Deryck, as a member of staff,, came to J.C. in1943. This it is gathered was a memorable occasion in more ways than\none since he arrived at the height of an air raid' and had to spend the night on St.Pancras Station. As a sportsman his interests are wide and\nvaried. VicePresident and President of the rugby\nand erick et clubs respectively are but two of his higher official positions whilst his prowess at captaining the Sunday cricket XI is beyond quest ion. If only his stay at the wicket were of a longer duration an afternoon's entertainment could be had by all watching his efforts to contact the\nball. Returning from America where he spent a year at M.I.T. he endeavour ed to instil upon the Rugby\nClub the arts of Yankee rugby but fortunately such\npadding was laughed at. To-day however he is quite often to be seen at Hari in gt on where his use\nin an advisory o a pao it y is highly appreciated. The Staff Tennis team is yet another of his responsibilities but it is rumoured that his service is becoming a little\" knotty\". Socially Deryck is a great asset to anything with which he is associated. As Dean of Residence\nhis diplomacy in averting trouble within the hostel due to inebriated residents is an education to witness and almost a pleasure to the culprit. A confirmed ba to hel or. it was with some surprise that at the R.S. M. Conversazione the li3t of guests\nread as follows\" All en,D. N. de a. and Mrs.\" - a dark horse perhaps'.\nMay we take this opportunity to congratulate him on his achievements which, together with those\nto come, must surely gain ample reward for his industry. OLD COLONIALS\nThe \"Old Colonials\" foregathered for this term's first meeting in Committee Room A.. Though warned by the import of liquid refreshment, those hallowed walls must have been distinctly surprised at the sudden transition from Council's grave deliberations to Maori and Afr loan war cries. The club was founded so that students from the\nDominions and other Commonwealth territories, and\neven the U.S.A., may meet in a convivial atmosphere\nto discuss each others' countries and customs, and\nthe peculiar life lived in these islands. The overseas fresher s did not find the native brew too repellent, and any pretence of formality vanished soon after Ken Bock had read what he claimed were\nthe minutes of the previous me et lng. The proceedings were highly enjoyable and this should prove\nthe first of a number of pleasant evenings during the year. EYE REMOVED IN ANTARCTIC Operation on I.C. Explorer\nAlan Reece came to the College in October 1941,\nas a first year Geologist. At the end of i the i session he Joined the Navy, was chose d as a member of\nthe Naval Expedition to Graham's Land and spent two\nand a half years in the An tar tic. On being de mobbed he rejoined the Geology Department and took his de\ndegree in1949. While at College he gave some\nfascinating lectures to the De La Beche Club and the\nNatural History Society on the An tar tic and it was\nno surprise when he joined, the British Scandinavian Expedition to Maudheim Land.\nHis main activities at College were with the\nBoat Club and in his last year he was elected Captain of the Club and was a member of the Henley crew.\nBefore sailing to Maudheim Land he expressed a desire to return to College and submit a Ph.D. Thesis on his work in the An tar tic, and we- hope that he will be with us next year. Extract by kind permission of THE TIMES. 2nd. October. \"Prom Dr. OVE WILSON, with the joint British Scandinavian An tar tic Expedition. Maudheim, 1st October\nA flying chip of rock damaged the right eye of the geologist, Alan Reece, when he was\ntaking a sample of the rock on 11th March,\nduring the summer's sledging. I met him eight days later and examined the eye, but no treat ment was possible at that stage as we were three weeks' journey from Maudheim.\nWhen we arrived at Maudheim on 30th May,\nthe development of the eye condition was uns at is factory, so I consulted by wireless the\neye specialist, Professor Sven Larsson, of Lund,\nSweden, with regard to treatment. During the\ntreatment my fears were confirmed that the other\neye was in grp ve danger of becoming affected, which would have resulted in total blindness; only the removal of the damaged eye could save\nthis. With the professor's advice I decided to\noperate within a week.\ni had never before performed or seen such\nan operation, and no one else at Kaudheim had\nhad experience of assisting in an operation. I started preparations immediately, informing only a few members of my intentions so as not\nto alarm the whole base. The photographer,\nStig Hall gren, was thoroughly instructed in the\ntechnique of intravenous anaesthesia., and trained himself on several members, including myself, by\ngiving vitamin injections. The geologist, Fred\nRoots, was^ selected to assist in the operation, and the gla cio log ist,V alter Sch y tt, was taught\nthe operating nurse's task of handling the\ninstrument table. At this stage, Reece was informed that the\noperation was necessary, and gaVe his consent,\nand it mas decided that it should take place three days later. The dog driver, Peter Melle by, constructed the operation table from sledging boxes, and an oxygen mask from spare \"weasel\"\nparts. Operation linen was sewn from sheets, and gauze, towels, linen and instruments were\nsterilized. The telegraph is t, Egil Rogstad,\nwas instructed in taking blood pressure, and\nthe assistants were given a lesson in sterility and operating teamwork.\nPREPARING FOR THE OPERATION.\nEverything was in order on 21st July for the operation, with almost every facility of\na small hospital, except female nurses. At\n2 o' clock I pulled the gloves on, and while the\nassistants completed the sterility arrangements\nI arranged the instruments on the table. At\n2.45 Reece made an impressively brave entrance,\nclimbed the operation table and- said: \"You\nknow, I am scared stiff inside.\" I then began\nthe administration of the intravenous anaesthetic. When the patient was asleep, Hall green took over while I changed gloves and prepared\nthe operating area.( Continued at the foot of the next page.)\n\n"

The night at H arlington was preceded by an ICU\ngeneral meeting on Hov. 1 st.,at which the arrangements were announced by the President, Mr. D.K. Nicolas.' We were informed that trouble had been\nexperienced over the firing of rockets and that this would have to be done at a time to be decided\nby the London Airport; also that no Very Lights were to be used, on Police and London Airport instructions. However, the meeting had its brighter moments, as when an enquire r questioned whether the\nbeer was strong enough to be able to stand before\nsale, and also in debating whether to defend the\nUnion against attack while most of its members were\na tH arlington. This being near London Airport, the whole intern atonal field was affected, and many reports have\ncome in of highly placed Diplomats cancelling Their flights and making surreptitious diversions to Prestwick and Lympne. Of course the Airport officials did their best by insisting that the launching of all rockets exceeding a hundred foot ceiling be referred to the airport control tower. However the\nannouncement that 'none of our aircraft are missing can only be provisional as it is belie.ved a number\nof rocket sticks have still to return to earth, and\nmay cause un imagine able havoc yet. But this was just childs play compared with the dangers on the ground, and it is feared that many\nyoung men found it necessary to exercise their protective powers on their companions. Dai-Fawkes, in his robes, was burnt on his death-bed', just by the\ngates, sur rou i ded by a howling mob of diabolically metamorphosed students, with anarchistic gl in is in their eyes. In fact this temporary distortion was\nso great that a lone drinker was later heard to comp la in th ut he could no longer recognised any of his friends. Although the firework a ic play ws.s fine, and\nevery th i.t, that should have gone off, went off,al on^ with ou e that shouldn't, the main attraction was unu ou b ted ly the 'Hop'. The Rugger, Soccer and\nHockey Clu ls made' tv.o raffish straw guys in proper\n/-.it, oil a back cl of ch which gave considerable tone to the proceedings, to match the I. C.W. A. effort on the\nbonfire guy. The u anc ing became progressively more\nhilarious with an endurance Polka and a disastrous 'Hoxy-kok y',in both of which Jack Howarth managed\nsuccessfully to collapse under a pile of shock-happy\nrevellers. Derek Hughes was seen in convulsions ey. tract in^ a very lively cracker from his left socket, fli.u.r re inc; mated 'Dai' was observed\ntravelling horizontally at shoulder height in an\nunspecified direction.Al together the three clubs\nare to be severely congratulated on such a distracting evening, and we suggest they run a. permanent Road House on the Bath Road for des-t it u test uae nt hitchhikers. Whet appeared at first a.n inconvenient arrangement- became a very\nsuccessful blow-off indeed.\nRATHER CATchino,\nFELIX himself only visited the recent Cat-Show at Olympia.\nHowever, he rather cared for these three\n3iam ese kittens. COM MEM. DAY The excellence of the Mines Centenary and the\nCommemoration Ball rather overshadowed the Commemoration Day Ceremony itself; beyond putting our praises and observations on record, there is little to say that we did not cover in the last FELIX, or that all those who attended these celebrations did not hear or see.\nSir Andrew McCanoe, as the Distinguished Visitor at Commemoration, gave as his address, on\nthe Royal School of Mines, some portraits of the\nfirst Professors of the School, and accounts of their attitude and development of it from its start within the Jermyn Street headquarters of the\nGeological Survey to its federation with the\nR.C.S. and Guilds into the Imperial College in1907. Thursday was a fine autumn day for the Commemoration Procession and Ceremony, which started at 2.30 p.m. The Chairman of the Ceremony was\nSir Campbell Stuart, who de put is ed for Viscount Falmouth, Chairman of the Governing Body. The\naddress by the Distinguished Visitor followed the\npresentation of the new Associates and Diplomats,\nHonorary Associates and Fellows; the Ceremony\nwas brought tc an end by the Rector's thanks to Sir Andrew.\nThe formal Conversazione followed on Thursday\neven ii jg, organised by the Mines' Union for the R.S.

It re-opened on Friday morning for. informal visits by the members of the u ol leg e, and\nthose who went saw plenty of intelligent and\nhumorous displays.,,' e must mention the ' Political Pala en to lo& y' and t ne 'Mine' - the graphical forecast in JJELIX combined the style of both. The floral decorations for both occasions were done by I.C....A. Finally, on \" rid gy ni feh t ca.me t.e Commemora tion Ball at Grosve..or House. About 85C people\nwere there, including al ar^e number of old students, particularly old Miners. The excitements of the General Election and the spirit one expects of a 'Mines Night' combined to make\na memorable evening. Although the results of the election were no longer in doubt, the President of the Union drew applause with the announcement that Mr. Churchill had been summoned\nto Buckingham Palace. The Tat ler photographers were in evidence and\nwrought havoc on the dance floor and among the\ntables. There were the usual clandestine efforts\n-some sucessful to avoid the Gro^v'en or House\ncork age. About midnight the band showed their mettle by an impromptu rendering of the Mines\nSong : a crowd of Mines surged to the floor to join their President in song. In a short speech\nafterwards, David Griffiths, introduced by the\nPresident of I.C. Union, thanked the College for allowing the Ball to be a 'Mines occasion'. The Ball ended at 2.0 a.m. but back in the\nUnion and in the Hostel the playing of musical instruments could be heard until the early hours.\nA quiet weekend followed. At the Saturday\nhop a large section of the dancers were noticeably less active than usual. CHRISTMAS CONCERT\nI.C. MUSICAL SOCIETY CHRISTMAS CONCsRT.\n\u2022C. Choir and Jacques String Orchestra.

WfcARNE\nCOLLEGE RAGS The past few years have seen a steady decline in the number and nature of college rags. No\nlonger are stories recounted of adventure and\nmisadventure; stories, like the fisherman's, increasing with the telling disco m 'forts of the\ntime forgotten. Such spontaneous expressions of college spirit are being shouldered-out of existence. Ever since the foundation of the\nUniversities there has been \"war\" between them\nand the civil authorities. During the middle ages\nmany bloody battles were fought between the scholars and the townspeople, the college authorities taking arms with the students against the \" plebs\". What\na difference from the position today when our own\nUniversity has joined forces with the civies.''.\nYet another facet of the modern trend towards a more and more highly organised existence. The\nUniversities no longer a law unto themselves, area cog in the wheel of the super state. Although the public may breath as i Bh of relief on being told that the college rag will soon be a thing of the past, is it for the ultimate good of the public that this should be so? We do\nnot think so. Roll on Morphy Day\\\\\nJ.W.M.( Correspondence is invited on this subject.)

SCIENCE AND ARCHITECTURE\nIn his lecture at the Royal College of Art, which was attended by a sprinkling of I.C. members,\nDr.Bronowski said that Architecture should use the\nscience of the day. Science is becoming imaginative, and imagination in science stimulates imagination as a whole. Science no longer believes that very. large or very small systems work like a mecca no model. Architects should reconstruct their attitude to their age old problems so as to use the\nnew scientific concept of general shape rather than\nthe old one of exact measurement. They should follow the e Le of the Architects of the South Bank Exh ibi lm London HYDE PARK\nThe I.C. eye, being concerned with science, may not see much of London. FELIX announces a new series designed, in semi-Baedeker style, to point out to our students a few of the things which should not be missed.\nHenry VH I knew what he was doing when he\nfounded Hyde Park, and Charles U, who laid down\nthe fashionable drive known as the \" Ring\", was\nsurely not ignorant of its Val ky ri an evening\ninhabitants. Four hundred acres, enclosed by the Serpentine, Bayswater Road, Park Lane and Knightsbridge, is a small area to contain football pitches, running tracks and the famous Rotten Row, now half metal led, on which we sport fancy clothes and fancies. For the hour between lectures, the bowling and\nputting greens and the restaurant are quite near\nthe college, on the way to the Serpentine in which\nyou can swim ( in season) or boat,\nCKfoKO ST. It should be known that the police and Guards\nreside in the park.\nGarble Arch, containing Orators' Corner and\na Drinking Fountain, is not nearly so interesting as Hyde Park corner, which apart from having\nthe Artillery memorial, Constitution Arch and a. colossal Achilles made from Wellington' s cannons,\nis much favoured by learner drivers, who may be\nseen rota ti jig for hours round the islands, unable\nto escape.\nWestward of the Park, Kensington Gardens houses\nthe creator of the 1851 Exhibition. His stony look, directed at the Exhibition catalogue, and the angels\nabove him who raise artistically outraged arms to heaven, are stimulating at least. \"He smiles not on Fair Science's humble home,\nBut melancholic ally scans the Dome.\"\nW. A.W. S.H. W.(It is hoped to continue this series later with articles on 'How to go to the Theatre Gallery', 'Where to eat around I.C.', 'Kensington Gardens',\n'The City on Sundays' etc. Such contributions are invited from anyone with ideas along these lines. We intend that they should\nbe of general interest, but they must be designed for students who will be in London only for their time a tI.C.; be they from Buenos Aires or Bath easton; or born here.)\n\n"
