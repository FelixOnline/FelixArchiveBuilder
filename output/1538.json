Tucked away from busy Fulham\nBroadway, where the quaint cobbled\nVanston Place meets quiet Farm Lane,\nrelative newcomer he Lazy Fox has\ndone just that.\nInitially I was slightly concerned\nthat the oft-lauded beer wall was only\na gimmicky way of drawing the punters \u2013 after stepping inside with my\nboyfriend, that certainly wasn\u2019t the\ncase. Upon setting up a tab card and\ngetting a pint-pulling demo from the\nlovely Jonathan, it actually presented\nitself as an ingenious benchmark for\npubs to follow: PYOP (pour your\nown pint) means that even on a busy\nnight, you won\u2019t be experiencing the\ninfamous Imperial FiveSixEight-esque\nqueues waiting for a pint. Or less than\na pint, even \u2013 the clever wall (of which\nI\u2019m trying hard not to insert references to a well-known kids\u2019 song about\ngreen bottles every time I think about\nit) allows you to pour in increments\nof 1/10th of a pint, with prices being\ndisplayed as you pour and adjusted depending on amounts.\nhis \ufb02exibility is perfect for the\nnitpicky to keep tabs (hah!) on their\nconsumption, or for the curious ones\nW\nFOOD\nFRIDAY 01 FEBRUARY\n22\nFood Editors: Carol Ann Cheah,\nSophia Goldberg, Yiango\nMavrocostanti\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nwanting to sample the whole mix of\nbeers on o\ufb00er. Don\u2019t expect Magners\nor Stella, as there\u2019s an eclectic international selection of eight drinks:\nfrom the Oktoberfest-favourite\nWarsteiner, to possibly my new fa-voUuite \u2013 craft brewer Meantime\u2019s\no\ufb00ering of London Pale Ale. Popular\ncustomersuggestionssometimesap-pear as featured drinks on the wall,\nand while prices may be a bit higher\ncompared to established favourite he White Horse further west\n(which we previously reviewed), I\u2019m\ncertainly not complaining with the\nadded control you get over your tipple here. Of course, if you\u2019re not a\ncraft beer person, you\u2019re more than\nwelcome to have a good ol\u2019 pint of\nGuinness or some other classics\nfrom the friendly barman.\nIt\u2019s nice to see that in spite of all\nthe modern bells and whistles, he\nLazy Fox still has a cosy charm\nabout it. he interior is clean and\nsimple, with wooden accents,\ncomfy couches and real \ufb01replaces\nin the bar \u2013 all of which keep it\nfrom feeling spartan and give the\nplace an intimate vibe, even on a\nquieter evening. he dining area\nat the back is roomy, easily seating\na good amount of diners without\nfeeling cramped. And of course,\nthe Fox has two decent-sized\nscreens with satellite TV for those\nall-important game days \u2013 other\nthan in your own home, this is one\nof the few opportunities you\u2019ll get\nto watch satellite TV in \u201cfront-ofthe-hearth\u201d com-fort.\nBut of course,\nwe couldn\u2019t leave\nthe place without\ninvestigating their\nbold GBK-challenging claims.\nTrue to its aim,\nthe core menu is\nmostly populated\nwith, well, burgers (\u00a39-12), while\nalso being \ufb02anked\nby a selection of\ntypical pub grub\n(like seafood lin-guine/sausage and\nmash) and daily\nspecials, all perfectly tailored to\nthe season. On\nSundays, there\u2019s a\nseparate roast dinner menu where\nthe meat selection\ndi\ufb00ers each week,\nand appears to be\none of their more\nhectic days. Even\nthough we didn\u2019t\nhave wine, I have\nit on good authority that the selection is perfectly\nmatched to the\nmenu whilst not\ncosting the Earth.\nOur pan-fried\nhalloumi salad\nstarter (one of said specials) was seasoned and dressed just right. I shared\nit with my boyfriend, who isn\u2019t the biggest fan of veggies but absolutely loved\nit \u2013 in hindsight, maybe I should\u2019ve\nhad one to myself!\nEver the carnivore, my boyfriend,\nplumped for their popular Redneck\nBurger (\u00a311.95): an 8oz \ufb01llet ribeye\nmix and barbecue pulled pork combination served with chips on the side.\nPresented on a rustic wooden chopping board, the size was absolutely\nunreal. We reckoned that if our bubbly Greek waitress Yanna was raving\nabout this burger despite not being a\nburger fan, we couldn\u2019t go wrong \u2013 and\nwas she right. Fox one, GBK nil.\nMy Fritto Mistro di Mare, another\ndaily special, single-handedly righted\nall that was wrong in this world with\ngreasy overcooked seafood. he batter was light and crisp, the squid and\nprawns were cooked just right, and the\n\ufb01sh \ufb01llets were so beautifully \ufb02aky that\nthey put a Labour politician\u2019s promises to shame. Like the Redneck, this\ncame with chips and salad on the side\nand was just as hearty. We noticed\none couple opted to settle the bill at\nthis point in the meal \u2013 prior to that\nwe heard them commenting on how\nfull they were getting even after two\ncourses, so it wasn\u2019t just us!\nDesserts (\u00a36 each) were a mixed bag,\nas their Apple Crumble could\u2019ve used\na bit more time to crisp up the top-ping; but their Sticky To\ufb00ee Pudding\nserved with ice cream was divine. he\nnice thing was that we were comfort-\n"

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 01 FEBRUARY\n10\nIt can strike anyone at any time in their\nlife. he percentage of students being\ndiagnosed with it has more than dou-bled, to 21% , over the past ten years.\nEvery year, it is partly responsible for\nhalf a million deaths worldwide, and\nevery indication is that this number will only increase as time passes.\nMedically, it belongs to a group of\nconditions which are some of the\nleast well understood on Earth, and\nsocially, attitudes towards it are often\nstill as backward as they were towards\nHIV in the late 1980s and early 90s. I\nam talking about depression, the most\ncommon mental illness out there, and\nsadly, one of those which to this day\nstill carries the most social stigma.\nToo many times one hears suicide\nattempts being labelled as \u201ccries for\nhelp\u201d, rather than being due to \u201creal\u201d\ndepression. Often in fact, those applying these labels are the same people\nwho would quite rightly be horri\ufb01ed\nby rape apologists making a claim that\nrapes are actually \u201cmade up\u201d, or by\nreligious extremists claiming that homosexuals can be \u201ccured\u201d. Indeed, as\na society our awareness of depression\nand mental health issues in general, is\nso far out dated that it is often deemed\nsocially acceptable to refer to individuals with severe clinical depression in\na derogatory way, to call them \u201cemo\u201d,\nneeding to \u201cman up\u201d (sexist much!?)\nor \u201cpull themselves together\u201d. As if,\nby telling someone going through a\nnervous breakdown or major depressive episode to make an e\ufb00ort to be\nmore sociable, work harder or just act\nas if nothing is wrong is somehow to\nhelp them. Would you expect someone dying of pneumonia to get better if you told their immune system\nto pull itself together and man up? I\nhope not!\nIn fact, the stigma associated with\ndepression runs far deeper. Having\nbeen medicated for depression, I now\nhave a mark on my life history which\nfor some careers would be viewed\nsimilarly to a black spot on your CRB.\nTaking a signi\ufb01cant amount of sick\nleave due to having a depressive epi-sode, no matter what anyone in human resources may try to tell you, is\nnot viewed in the same way in corporate land as taking sick leave to recover from any other, more \u201creal\u201d illness.\nWhy is that? Why is it that I, as someone who has su\ufb00ered from depression,\nshould fear a remission of symptoms,\njust in case my future boss thinks I\nam weak, or, worse, lazy! Why should\nI, as someone who for all intents and\npurposes is completely healthy (could\nlose a few pounds maybe??), have to\nexplain myself if applying for a job\nat the home o\ufb03ce, or any other role\nwhere I handle sensitive information.\nIn short, why do we as a society \ufb01nd\nit so hard to treat people recovering\nfrom mental illness just like they were\nrecovering from any other illness?\nhe obvious answer is that with\nmore physical (don\u2019t like using that\nword, but it will have to do) illnesses,\nthe symptoms are clear and well de\ufb01ned. You vomit blood, you\u2019re ill; no\none is going to argue with that, no\none will blame you for it. You shove\na handful of pills in your mouth and\ntry to down it with vodka before being brought to your senses by your\ngirlfriend (ex, naturally) who then\nproceeds to tear the bottle out of your\nhand\u2026 that was a symptom of my\ncondition; no one will argue with that,\nbut you can\u2019t quite see it in the same\nway can you?\nherein lies the problem. People\nmust take some degree of responsibility for everything they do, regardless\nof whether they are mentally ill or\nnot. However, if someone mentally ill\ncommits a crime, you lock them up,\nbut make sure you lock them up in a\nhospital, rather than a prison. We do\nthis because we are aware that, even\nwhen we know a person, mental illness may cause us to no longer recognise that very individual, because\nof how it in\ufb02uences their behaviour.\nWhen I had my \ufb01rst, and hopefully\nlast, depressive episode, it a\ufb00ected me\nin a way I cannot not adequately describe to someone who has not experienced it \ufb01rst-hand. How strongly it\ntook hold me, how powerless I felt to\ndo anything about it, and the state of\nmind I had to be in to consider death\nas a lovely holiday rather than something best avoided, no amount of poetry or literature can describe it. I was\nlucky to have had family and friends,\nalmost all of whom stood by me during that time, who tried their best to\nunderstand what I was going through.\nHowever, I know many people are not\nso lucky.\nIt is for this reason that I have decided to write this article, after eventually stumbling across someone who\nhad been through what I had, the day\nto day struggle of coping with my condition was made much more manage-able, and so I am delighted to hear\nthat Becky Lane (Deputy President\n(Welfare) for those of you that don\u2019t\nknow) is setting up a mental health\nawareness day in the near future,\nwhich I hope will also be an opportunity for like-minded (illness of the\nmind, like minded\u2026 get it?) individuals to come out of the woodwork and\nsupport each other. I also hope that if\nyou know someone (if you don\u2019t yet\nthen one day you will), su\ufb00ering from\ndepression, you try to remember that\nthe person they were before their\nepisode isn\u2019t gone, and you do your\nbest to support them and be there for\nthem while you wait for them to return to their normal selves, that is all\nanyone can ask.\nAnd to anyone reading this who is\ncurrently su\ufb00ering from depression,\nthere is a light at the end of the tunnel\u2026 and it isn\u2019t heaven. If you are\nreally unlucky you will have to ride\nthis out for half a year, most of you\nwon\u2019t have to wait much more than 3\nmonths, so hang in there bro!\nUNSEEN\nimperial\nDepression: the\nstigmatised illness\nWhat is Unseen Imperial?\nUnseen Imperial is a project that aims\nto talk about the things that we don\u2019t\nreally feel comfortable about, but they\nare there if you scratch the surface.\nMental health, discrimination, bully-ing; all the things that sometimes we\npretend aren\u2019t happening right under\nour noses. It is a forum/campaign/dis-cussion \u2013 whatever you want to call it,\na project to get people talking about\nthese \u2018uncomfortable\u2019 issues so that\nhopefully work can be done as a community towards de-stigmatising them.\nJonathan London Writer\nThe figures about student depression don\u2019t make for pleasant reading \u2013 but so many suffer in silence.\nI have so much admiration for the\nauthor of this piece for speaking\nout about his experiences without\nanonymity. For those of you reading\nthis article who have experienced\ndepression in the past or present,\nthere are people and services available to help. In College there are the\nCounselling Service (www3.imperi-al.ac.uk/counselling), your GP, your\npersonal/senior tutor, the Union\nAdvice Centre (contacted by emailing advice@imperial.ac.uk) and the\nCollege Tutors (contacted by emailing college-tutors@imperial.ac.uk).\nThere are also many organisations\nexternal to Imperial that can help\nyou through your difficulties such\nas Nightline \u2013 a confidential listening service aimed specifically at\nstudents (0207 631 0101). Although\nI am sure at times depression can\nmake you feel like the loneliest person in the world; with all these support services, there is no need to\nbattle depression alone.\nIf you are passionate about mental health issues and delivering an\nimportant message to the Imperial\ncommunity, get in touch with me by\nemail on dpwelfare@imperial.ac.uk\nto join the Mental Health campaign\ngroup. Whether you feel passionate\nabout combating the myths about\ndepression, or lobbying College to\nincrease their counselling provi-sion; as a group our voice is louder.\nWant to contribute to Unseen Imperial?

It applies for\nall of the positions, but especially applies\nto the sabbaticals.\nFirst up: are your intentions \u2018pure\u2019 for\nthe lack of a better word? If the reason\nyou are running is something along\nthe lines of \u201cI don\u2019t have a job and want\nsomething good to put on my CV\u201d, then\ndon\u2019t bother. Yeah, just because you\nwant a good CV doesn\u2019t necessarily\nmeanthatyouwon\u2019tbegood,butitdoes\nmean you are unlikely to really go above\nand beyond the position and give your all\ntoit.Especiallywhenyou\u2019reinthedepths\nof a massive all nighter and what you are\ndoing could affect a lot of other people.\nThink of it in this simplistic way: would\nyou want a pilot to be not really paying\nmuch attention and just hanging about\nwhile landing the plan you\u2019re on?\nIf you are considering running for Felix\nEditor: go for it!

It\u2019s\na lot of responsibility, but it\u2019s also a lot of\nfun. What follows is a brief rundown of\nwhat life is going to be like if you become\nFelix Editor.\nFun.That\u2019stheonewordI\u2019duse.Iknow\nusing the word fun makes it sound like a\ncrapcorporatemarketingschemeand/or\nsomething you were told to trick you into\ndoing science, but it\u2019s true.

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 01 FRIDAY\n20\nRory Fenton\nHow to look good dead\nwas told once that the best\nway to know a city is to get\nlost in it. I can\u2019t say if this is\na universal truth but with my\ntruly terrible sense of direction I\u2019ve had plenty of chances to put\nit to the test. It was just this Monday\nthat I made my favourite \ufb01nding to\ndate. Bumbling around the mean\nstreets of Chelsea, lost and late for\na lecture, I took a shortcut through\nBrompton Cemetery and turned a\n\ufb01ve minute shortcut into a 30 minute\nstroll, stopping at the most interesting graves, walking around the di\ufb00erent mausoleums and ensuring I was\nmore than fashionably late for that\nlecture.\nhe cemetery houses the moulder-ing great and the decaying good of\n19th and early 20th Century London\nand long ago reached capacity. But\nwhat attracted me to the place was\nnot so much the architecture of the\nvarious stone monuments as gaining\na snapshot of how people had chosen to have themselves, or their loved\nones, remembered. To sum up one\u2019s\nlife in the space of a gravestone, perhaps the length of a tweet, is surely\nimpossible and yet something must\nbe written. It was looking at the different attempts at this \u201csumming\nup\u201d that grabbed my attention for so\nlong and got me thinking about how\nand why people pick certain graves.\nFor those of you considering dying\nat some stage, here\u2019s my handy cut-out-and-keep guide to choosing your\ngrave. After all, if you get it wrong,\nyou won\u2019t get the chance to change\nyour mind.\nhe \ufb01rst consideration when choosing your \ufb01nal resting place is surely\nlocation. Residents of Brompton\nCemetery clearly had this in mind by\npicking the lea\ufb01est, poshest area in\nthe city. One of the saddest aspects\nof death is its democratic nature \u2013 it\ntakes us all and treats us as if we were\nthe same. By buying a really swanky\nlocation for your grave you ensure\nI\nRory Fenton on posthumous presentation\nthat future generations will know just\nhow loaded you were. If you wouldn\u2019t\nbe seen dead outside of SW, make\nsure you aren\u2019t.\nNow after a long, hard life don\u2019t you\ndeserve to decay in style? Cemetery\nchic is very much in for when you\ngo under but choosing that perfect\ntomb isn\u2019t quite as simple as keeping up with latest from the Milan\ncatwalk. You\u2019ll want a timeless clas-sic, something that endures through\nthe ages but is still totally \u201cyou\u201d and\nstands out. his absolutely means\nthat the classic \u201crounded rectangle\u201d\ngravestone is a no-no. Nothing says,\n\u201cI really wasn\u2019t that much\u201d like a miserable rounded rectangle \u2013 it\u2019s the\njeans and t-shirt of the grave world\nand, darling, you deserve better. Not\nall budgets stretch to it but a taste-ful, life-sized statue of an angel is\na great way to express yourself and\nsomething many Brompton residents\nhave given their seal of approval. Another really great investment that we\nat Felix can\u2019t get enough of is a roof.\nRemember, your hair still grows after\nyou die and you certainly don\u2019t want\nit getting wet. A classic choice is the\nmausoleum, a small house to keep\nyou nice and dry during those winter\nmonths and really leave your mark on\nthe landscape.\nLastly we come to the tricky part-what to write? his has to be the most\npersonal part of the grave experience\n\u2013 just how can you leave that perfect\n\ufb01nal message to the world? Yes, you\ncould go it alone, but we at Felix have\nsome great tips to make your epitaph\nan epictaph. Remember that the ideal\ngravestone is a permanent business\ncard; you want to make sure that people know just who\u2019s worm-gobbled\nremains they\u2019re walking past. Include\nany titles you may have like Sir, Lady\nand so on. I saw one person in Brompton who went so far as to mention\ntheir Oxford MA and the barrister\n\ufb01rm they worked for \u2013 take an up-to-date CV to your local stone masons\nand see what they can do with it.\nOnce you\u2019ve made it clear just who\nyou were, how will you \ufb01nd those\nchoice sentences that really encapsulate your life?\nhis could be quite a challenge but\nluckily there\u2019s a handy, one-size-\ufb01tsall solution to that: a bible quote. Nobody wants to run the risk of having\npeople disapprove of their choice of\nepitaph. By choosing a quote from\nthe bible, even if you don\u2019t believe in\nit in the slightest, you shield yourself\nfrom criticism and ensure you blend\nin nicely with the other bible quotes\non your neighbours\u2019 graves. Sorted.\nSo there\u2019s my guide to How To Look\nGood Dead, allowing you to remain\nfashionable right up to the end and\nbeyond. By following these simple\nrules you really can take all of the\nhassle out of dying and \ufb01nally begin\nto look forward to it.\nBut let\u2019s say, for the sake of argu-ment, that there\u2019s another approach\nto death and another take on the\nBrompton Cemetery. he stoneworks\ntoday are giving way to the chisel-like\nwind and rain of a century, the carved\nstatements of self-importance rendered increasingly illegible with passing years. he cemetery remains, as\nany other cemetery, a \ufb01eld of buried,\nindistinguishable skeletons; a congress of ex-people.

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\nFRIDAY 01 FEBRUARY\nLGBT history month\nt\u2019s February, and that means\nit\u2019s once again time for LGBT\nHistory Month. For those of\nyou that may not be aware,\nLGBT History Month aims\nto draw attention to both the past and\nthe present state of LGBT (lesbian,\ngay, bisexual and transgender) rights,\nas well as the impact LGBT people\nhave had throughout history. While in\nmany cases the sexuality of historical\n\ufb01gures is only speculative, it is important to acknowledge that alternative\nsexualities have always existed, and\nare not some \u201cmodern lifestyle choice\u201d.\nFor example, while many people will\nknow of Sir Francis Bacon, King James\nI and Florence Nightingale, they may\nnot be aware that these historical \ufb01gures are believed to have had relationships with members of the same sex.\nLGBT History Month was \ufb01rst organised in 2005 by Schools OUT (a\ngroup promoting equality for LGBT\npeople in education) to celebrate the\nrepeal of a government act known as\nSection 28.\nWhat was Section 28?:\nSection 28 was enacted in 1988 by the\nConservative government. he Act\ncovered \u201cProhibition on promoting\nhomosexuality by teaching or by publishing material\u201d and stated that:\n\u201cA local authority shall not \u2013\n(a) intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality;\n(b) promote the teaching in any\nmaintained school of the acceptability\nof homosexuality as a pretended family relationship.\u201d\nhere were many aspects of this act\nthat were damaging to the homosexual community. he term \u201cpromoting\nhomosexuality\u201d lends credence to the\n(false) belief that sexuality is a choice\nthat people can be encouraged to\ntake. Also, the act was implemented\nto \u201cprotect\u201d children, implying that\nhomosexuality is inherently dangerous to young people. Many LGBT student and support groups were closed\ndown due to fears that they would be\nbreaching the Act.\nMany people and groups spoke out\nagainst this legislation, and it prompted Sir Ian McKellen to publicly come\nout on BBC Radio 3 during a discussion of the Act. Regarding Section 28,\nhe says: \u201che notorious Section 28 was\na disaster for children in state schools\nbecause it encouraged their teachers\nto lie about homosexuality\u201d. It was\nrepealed (against much opposition) in\n2000 in Scotland and 2003 in the rest\nof Great Britain.\nWhy do we celebrate LGBT\nHistory Month?:\nWhile LGBT people and couples in\nthe UK enjoy most of the legal freedoms enjoyed by everyone else, many\nof these were only introduced within\nthe last 10-15 years. hese include\nequal age of consent (2001), transexu-alism declassi\ufb01ed as an illness (2002)\nand various anti-discrimination laws\n(1999-2010). However, there are still\nsome areas (such as blood donation)\nwhere laws aren\u2019t equal. Laws regarding equal marriage are currently being\nintroduced.\nHowever, while the laws in the UK\nare (mostly) equal, it is a sad truth that\nthere is still a large amount of LGBTphobic abuse. A few facts gathered by\nthe Youth Chances LGBTQ Survey\npaint a rather alarming picture:\n\u2022 3 out of 4 respondents have received verbal abuse because of their\nsexuality.\n\u2022 Nearly half of respondents have\nexperienced threats due to their sexu-ality.\n\u2022 1 in 4 respondents have been physically abused because of their sexual-ity.\n\u2022 LGBTQ youths are up to 5 times\nmore likely to self harm than other\nyouths.\nhese numbers don\u2019t cover every-thing, as it doesn\u2019t take into account\nthose who have lost their lives as a\nresult of LGBT-phobic abuse. The\nIndependent on Sunday is aware of\nat least nine people in the UK who\nwere killed or committed suicide after\nLGBT-phobic bullying between 2009\nand 2011. One of these was Ian Baynham, who was beaten to death in the\nmiddle of Trafalgar Square by a group\nof teenagers shouting homophobic\nabuse. Unfortunately, the number of\nhate crimes against LGBT people in\nthe UK is rising.\nWhen we look at the rest of the\nworld, homosexual acts are illegal in\nover 70 countries, and seven of these\nhave the death penalty for such acts\n(eight if pending legislation in Uganda\nis passed). Also, Russia has recently\npassed a law prohibiting homosexual,\nbisexual and transgender \u201cpropaganda\u201d, much akin to our Section 28.\nHowever, the same law also covers\npaedophilia, essentially equating these\ncategories. In many other countries,\nthe stats for LGBT related hate crimes\nare just as bad, if not worse than those\nin the UK.\nhe above facts demonstrate that\nthere are still many hurdles before\nLGBT people can be counted as\ntruly equal. To quote Lester B. Pearson (14th Prime Minister of Canada\nand 1957 Nobel Peace Prize winner),\n\u201cMisunderstanding arising from ignorance breeds fear, and fear remains the\ngreatest enemy of peace\u201d. One way we\ncan remove this ignorance is to make\nLGBT people more visible, both presently and historically, and give others\nthe opportunity to learn and under-stand. his is why we observe LGBT\nHistory Month.\nIQ is Imperial College\u2019s LGBT soci-ety. If you wish to come to our events,\nyou can sign up to our mailing list by\nvisiting www.union.ic.ac.uk/scc/iq.\nIf you identify as LGBTQ (lesbian,\ngay, bisexual, transgender, queer or\nquestioning) and are aged 16-25, you\nare invited to take part in the Youth\nChances survey. he project aims to\nassess the quality of life experienced\nby LGBTQ youths in the UK by gar-tering data from 15,000 people.

Enormous data sets can be\nstored concisely and accurately. If\nmaintained in cold, dry and dark en-vironment, it could last for millen-nia.\nhe team led by Nick Goldman\ntranslated computer \ufb01les into DNA\ncode, synthesised the DNA, sequenced it, and reconstructed the\n\ufb01les with 100 percent accuracy.\nAll the data was stored on 153,335\nstrings of DNA, each made up of 117\nnucleotides.\nNick Goldman suggests that DNA\nstorage could be used in large-scale,\nlong-term projects, for example, at\nCERN, the European nuclear research centre in Geneva. Eighty\npetabytes \u2013 that is 1 million gigabytes \u2013 of data about the Large Hadron Collider currently stored on disk\ncould be kept in a small amount of\nDNA.\nTechnological advances are rapidly\nreducing DNA synthesis costs, suggesting this form of storage might be\nwith us sooner than we think.\nScientists have considered storing\ndata in live vectors, such as bacte-ria. But mutations might change the\ntext over time and storage conditions\nwould have to be carefully regulat-ed. And perhaps the idea is just too\nstrange: Martin Luther King, more\nthan forty-\ufb01ve years after his assassi-nation, living on in a bacterial smear.\nShakespeare's Sonnet 55 begins:\nNot marble, nor the gilded monuments of princes, shall outlive this\npowerful rhyme... A statement that\nappears eerily true.\nDOI: 10.1038/nature11875\nith great\np o w e r\ncomes great\nre sp onsibility,\u201d one\nwise man once said. Although he was\nunknowingly hinting at those with\nsuper powers to tread carefully, it too\ncan be applied in the wider context to\nthose that have the capacity to seriously a\ufb00ect people, either for good\nor bad. Right now, scientists are the\nsuper heroes of the real world (that\nincludes you, so feel free to give yourself a pat on the back right now. Yes,\neven if you are alone in the Library\nCaf\u00e9), and with technology accelerating at metaphorical speeds to the\npoint where we had to even rede\ufb01ne\nthe greatest literal speed, great responsibility needs to come into play\ntoo.\nVirologists are such people who\nhave been treading carefully as of\nlate. Last year they imposed upon\nthemselves a moratorium to halt investigations into the avian H5N1 virus \u2013 a strain of in\ufb02uenza that is gaining momentum in infection, both in\nhumans and birds, and which could\nlead to the next pandemic.\nResearch was initially put on a 60\nday hiatus in January 2012 to discuss\nthe biosecurity hazards of the investigations into H5N1. his was sparked\nby the attempt to publish previous research covering the mutations needed for the virus to allow transmission\nbetween ferrets and that could possibly allow for human transmission\ntoo. Researchers reasoned that such\nmutations could just as easily occur in\nnature, and ignorance will de\ufb01nitely\nnot lead to bliss if we just turn a blind\neye. It is better knowing the capacity of the virus and being able to plan\nfor a possible pandemic than feeling\nthreatened by the hazards posed by\ncarrying out such research in the \ufb01rst\nplace, the scientists reasoned.\nHowever, people who opposed this\nincluded the National Scienti\ufb01c Advisory Board for Biosecurity sector\nof the American government, who\nfeared that without censoring the pa-pers, such data could be misused by\nsmall labs that could lead to an outbreak of an arti\ufb01cially manufactured,\ndangerous strain of the pathogen. So\ndespite research picking up considerable speed, the hiatus was introduced.\nhis \u201c60 day\u201d period halted as of\nlast week however, and a letter from\nkey researchers in the \ufb01eld con\ufb01rmed\nthat with the WHO, among others,\nissuing rules concerning biosafety,\nbiosecurity and communication, investigations will now proceed. Governments and institutions need to\napprove research before it is taken\nany further, and a biosafety level of\n3 or higher in labs is suggested as\nnecessary for the work. With level 4\nbeing the highest and necessary for\ninvestigations into pathogens such as\nEbola, another virus whose infection\nis lethal and currently has no cure,\nlevel 3 for a virus with a lethality that\nis considerably less was considered\nappropriate.\nHowever, how careful is too care-ful? \u201cScienti\ufb01c curiosity,\u201d for want of\na better phrase, has never been one\nto carefully toe the line between what\nis needed for scienti\ufb01c advancement\nand the relative views of the general\npublic. Safety concerns, moral con\ufb02icts and technological constraints\nhave all been known to hinder re-search, and it is how researchers conduct themselves when overcoming\nthese barriers, and the responsibility\nthey exhibit, that can add, or diminish considerable value to the papers\nthat they then publish.\nOften, a balance has to be struck,\nand this may be an example of when\nthe balance was just about right. he\nintroduced safety measures may limit\nthe lab numbers that can investigate\nH5N1, but at least the labs that will\nbe able to will do so without danger\nto themselves and others. Advancement speed may be sti\ufb02ed, but at\nleast measures like these may stop silly journalists wandering into labs and\ngetting bit by whatever research is on\nshow at the time. Because as much as\nwe might like it, there are not enough\nUncle Bens in the world to simply\nstate that with \u201cGreat power comes\ngreat responsibility,\u201d and hope that\nthat alone does the job.\nDOI:10.1038/nature11858\nPhilippa Skett on the H5N1 moratorium and why caution isn\u2019t bad\nH5N1 \u2013 coming to a\nlab near you soon\nDeoxyribonucleic acid: THE BEST ACID\nhttp://www.westminster.ac.uk\n\u201c\nW\n\n"

He\nis also a proli\ufb01c writer on his web log\nat taxresearch.org.uk.\nhe seminar was organised at the\nheight of the scandal with new stories\nbeing released daily. he very week the\nseminar was organised, Bloomberg\nuncovered that Google avoided $2bn\nin worldwide taxes by moving $10bn\nto a Bermuda based entity. In addition\nto this, the Sunday Independent in Ireland found Google paid only 0.14%\ntax on sales of $62bn in seven years.\nOther companies implicated in this\nbrazen circumvention of taxation include Starbucks with sales of \u00a33bn\nin 14 years which paid only \u00a38.6m in\ncorporation tax and Amazon with UK\nsales of \u00a33.35bn in 2011 which only reported \u00a31.8m in tax expenses.\nhe companies would all insist on\nfull compliance with the laws through\n\ufb01nancial advice from the \u201cBig Four\u201d\naccounting \ufb01rms. he response of\nEric Schmidt, Google Chairman, was\nunapologetic saying that the company\nwas proudly capitalistic and paid taxes\nin \u201clegally prescribed ways\u201d. Yet numerous MPs and commentators condemned these practices on the basis\nof morality. For example, Margaret\nHodge of the public accounts committee said quite clearly, \u201cWe\u2019re not\naccusing you of being illegal, we are\naccusing you of being immoral.\u201d\nhus Richard Murphy was asked to\naddress whether this really is a question of morality. Has Google been\nbreaking its motto of \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d?\nA full recording of the event is now\navailable on the Political Philosophy\nwebsite in which he begins by discussing why this is a signi\ufb01cant issue\nnow and the scale of the \u201ctax gap\u201d in\nrelation to the UK de\ufb01cit. He then addresses the question of legality and\nhow companies avoid tax by undermining rules to prevent double taxation and \ufb01nally, he presents his argument on why aggressive tax avoidance\nis unethical by considering the nature\nof the state and the power of legislation in enforcing property rights and\nthe right to tax.\nhe next Political Philosophy Society event will be on hursday 7th\nFebruary at 6:30pm in RSM LTG20\non \u201che Future of Money\u201d. A panel\nof invited speakers will discuss future money systems that may emerge\nin the midst of widespread \ufb01nancial\ncrises and with the vast proliferation\nof digital technology. For example,\nwill our fundamental conception of\nmoney be altered by the emergence of\nvirtual currencies such as Bitcoin and\nas more transactions are completed\nelectronically? Or will it\nbe necessary to return to\na money system based on\nthe gold standard?\nhe three invited\nspeakers are Detlev\nSchlichter (Economist\nand author of Paper\nMoney Collapse \u2013 he\nFolly of Elastic Money\nand the Coming Monetary Breakdown), Tarek\nEl Diwany (writer and\nconsultant in Islamic\nbanking and \ufb01nance and\na senior partner at Zest\nAdvisory LLP) and Amir\nTaaki (Bitcoin project\ndeveloper and Chairman\nof the Bitcoin Consultancy).\nhe PPS exists as a forum\nfor discussion on a broad\nrange of political and\nphilosophical matters.\nIts aim is to encourage\ndebate and discussion on\ncampus that will lead to\na better understanding of\nthe world in general.

It\nused to be the most\nvaluable company on\nEarth, ever. Now, stockholders are insecure and other brands\nhave come close, if not eclipsed, the\natmosphere of \u2018coolness\u2019 that Apple\nonce made its own. Have they diverted o\ufb00 their successful path, have they\ndone wrong? Or is this just a momentarily glitch?\nHumble beginnings\nLet\u2019s quickly summarise Apple\u2019s ori-gins, as to understand the future, you\nhave to know about the past. Established on the 1st of April by Steve Jobs,\nSteve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne.\nApple Computer Inc, as it was known\nin the early days, was quite success-ful; they sold the Apple I and Apple II,\nthe latter being one of the \ufb01rst highly\nsuccessful microcomputers made. Its\nsuccess is mostly accredited to its ease\nof use, and utility programs (e.g. VisiCalc, the \ufb01rst spreadsheet program).\nAfter the release of the unsuccessful\nApple III, came the era of the Lisa\ncomputer and the Macintosh. During this time the \ufb01rst fractures were\nseen between the Apple board and\nJobs. hus after an attempted putsch,\nJobs was forced out of the company in\n1985. he next \ufb01ve years were relatively successful for Apple, even without\nJobs. However, then things started to\ngo downhill. Mismanagement, wasteful uses of resources and overwhelmingly confusing product lines left the\nconsumer at a loss, leading to Apple\u2019s\ndecline. Facing bankruptcy, Jobs was\nbrought back as an advisor and then\ninterim CEO. He then restructured\nthe whole company. He retired several products, released revolutionary\nnew ones (iPod, iMac etc.) and generally changed the business model that\nApple used. It still took Apple a while\nto really achieve mainstream success,\nbut things were looking up. In 2007,\nwith the release of the iPhone, Apple was on the way to the top,\nand eventually became\nthe most valuable con-sumer-directed company in the world.\nhen Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, which\nseverely a\ufb00ected\nhis day to day\nrunning, forcing\nhim to take medical leave. his leave\na\ufb00ected the stock\nmarket, with Apple\nlosing several percent\nin trading the following\ndays. Jobs passed away\non 5th October 2011. Following Job\u2019s death, Apple\nhave gone from strength to\nstrength, becoming the world\u2019s\nmost valuable company. However,\nnow Apple\u2019s stock is down, speculators are doubting them to stay ahead\nof the game.\nEffect: Jobs\nhere we have it. So what conclusions\ncan we draw from this? Firstly, I think\nFRIDAY 01 FEBRUARY\n44\nA\nif Jobs would still be around, Apple\nwould be doing better. Job\u2019s perfectionist management style, ability to\nsay no and general revolutionary view\nof technology are what made Apple\nwhat it is. He was the god of the com-pany, and inspired all his employees to\napply themselves to the best of their\nabilities, and forcing all the big egos of\nApple to work together to create great\nproducts. In fact when Cook took\nover, Forstall (head of iOS) was asked\nto leave after some high pro\ufb01le mistakes in iOS 6 (e.g. Maps). However\nit seems the real reason of his\n\u201c\ufb01ring\u201d was his feud with\nJonathan Ives, award-winning designer,\nwho designed,\namongst others,\nthe iPod, iMac\nand iPhone,\nw h i c h\nwas kept at bay by Jobs.\nhis unique approach to leading a\ncompany, gave Apple the reputation\nof being a company that has the best\nquality products that you can trust.\nWith the advent of \u2018Mapgate\u2019, this\nreputation is starting to erode. Also,\nit seems that the company is\nalso resting on its laurels.\nWhile for any business\nwith $86 billion in the\nbank and record prof-its, this may seem quite\nokay, however, for Apple okay\nshould not be enough.\nEffect: No Jobs\nhe release of the iPad Mini, and\nrumours of a low budget phone\nalso worry me. his reminds\nme too much of the \ufb01rst\nnon-Jobs era. he one\nproduct per function approach was\nperfectly work-able, and with new\nhybrid products the\nconsumer will be confused about what is really best for them.\nA lack of revolutionary\nproducts is also a key factor in\nApple\u2019s sinking. While Apple was\nknown for creating something new\nevery year, or doing something\nthat really kicked the market\u2019s\nbutt. With the last few keynotes\nthough, starting with the iPhone\n4S, Apple hasn\u2019t really done anything new. Yes, the iPhone 5 has a\nbigger screen, but that is just a reaction to the market. In fact so is\nthe iPad Mini. Apple is reacting to\nothers, instead of setting a standard of being the proactive one.\nEffect: Android et all\nHowever, not only internal factors\nhave led to Apple\u2019s decline in the\nrecent weeks. Increased pressure\nfrom Android, Windows 8 and the\nSamsung Galaxy line in particular\nhave not really helped. iOS is still a\ngood operating system, if a bit out-dated. Androids great modi\ufb01abilApple, sweet or sour outlook?\nMaximilian Eggl dissects the taste of the future for the fruity company\nity has lead to the decline in the iPhone OS, and now with Windows 8,\na great operating system in its own\nright, it ain\u2019t getting better for the\nCupertino based \ufb01rm. Also a very\nsmart marketing campaign by Samsung has really damaged Apple\u2019s rep\nas the coolest product around. In\nfact, many people see Apple as being\ndependable, for their parents, but\nnot for themselves.\nSo what?\nhis apparent downfall does depress\nme somewhat. I used to get excited before Apple keynotes (sad, yes I know)\nbecause I knew something amazing\nwould be on show. Nowadays, I tune\nin just to keep up with what\u2019s happen-ing. Apple need something or someone to kick it in the backside and get\nit going. Steve Jobs is not around to\ndo that anymore. Cook, seems able,\nbut he has not been faced with a crisis\nbefore. All the Android fanboys and\nWindows fanatics, are probably overjoyed that this tech giant is possibly in\ndecline. But think on this, without Apple there would not be an Ultrabook,\nsmartphone, tablet, app-based market\nlike there is today. If Apple doesn\u2019t go\nback to its old self, we\u2019ll never know\nwhat we could have had.\nFollowing\nJob\u2019s death,\nApple have\ngone from\nstrength to\nstrength\n\u201c\u201d\nIf Apple\ndoesn\u2019t go\nback to its\nold self, we\u2019ll\nnever know\nwhat we could\nhave had.\nTim Cook the right man for the job(s) to save Apple?\nApple is in a fragile state, just\nlike their products, as this 1\u201d drop\nproves.\nThe original Apple logo\n\n"

Their opponents had\nlost one of their main fencers, but\ngained an international who held his\nground well in foil and epee. Whilst\nthe epeeists found the going tough,\nlosing their match 32-45, the foil-ists were able to even out the score\nthrough a 45-35 victory and then\nhanding it over to the sabreurs to\ncomfortably win 45-13 for an overall\nvictory of 122-93.\nNext up they had Cambridge, an\nopponent which had always been\nstrong but where Imperial had always been able to rely on the sabre\nteam saving the day. However, this\ntime they were reminded that no\nsuccess should be taken for granted\nand nothing lasts forever: sabre still\nwon their match but by a margin\nmuch smaller than previously since\nCambridge had now gained some\nnew faces that were able to put up\na challenge. IC\u2019s sabre victory was\nstill by a fairly solid 14 hits, but\nwith Cambridge being significantly\nstronger in both epee (27-45) and\nfoil (22-45) they had to accept an\noverall defeat (94-121).\nThe following day, the girls joined\nthem on the adjacent piste. Ahead\nof them were the last two matches\nof the league, against Cambridge\nand UCL, whilst the guys had only\nthe newcomers UWE left. The latter match was not expected to be a\nbig challenge, based on their performance against the other teams, so it\ncame as no surprise that the sabreurs\nquickly finished their match (45-17)\nand left it to the foilists (45-40) and\nepeeists (45-44) to wrap it up.\nAlongside this, the girls started off\nfacing Cambridge, a team they had\nalready beaten away earlier in the\nseason. Both the epeeists and foilists\nwere able to increase their indicators\nthis time, from 43-44 to 45-42 for the\nformer and 34-45 to 38-45 for the\nlatter. This meant that sabre wasn\u2019t\nunder much pressure, but they still\nhad to win the match for us to win\noverall. The results from last time\n(45-25) indicated that the task wasn\u2019t\ngoing to prove too tough, however\nall three girls had recently suffered\nfrom injuries and illness and struggled especially against Cambridge\u2019s\nstrong Polish sabreur. The rest of\nthe team couldn\u2019t do anything but\nwatch and cheer, but they were not\nto be disappointed: the match ended\n45-38 to Imperial and they were just\none match away from a clean sweep.\nThe epeeists had warmed up to\ntake on UCL, a weapon match that\nhad been lost last time due to some\nteam changes. With a 10 hit victory\nin memory, UCL seemed confident\nthat it was going to be similar this\ntime and as a result gradually got\nmore shocked as they lost hit after\nhit, reaching a final score of 45-28.\nThe sabreurs took over and showed\nno mercy with heroic efforts in the\nfinal bouts to produce a stunning\nscore at 45-17, meaning that even\nif UCL was to win foil by 45-0 they\ncould not win overall. IC\u2019s foilists re-laxed, happy to avoid any pressure,\nwhilst UCL were fencing for their\nown pride. The final result landed\non 41-45, a comfortable overall IC\nvictory of 135-90. The two IC teams\ncelebrated the end of the weekend\nwith some pizza, working on preparing the guys mentally for the second\nleg of the league the following week-end.\nFencing gives you wings!\n\u201cKeep the Cat Free\u201d\nfelixonline.co.uk\n01/02/13\n@SportFelix\nOn Wednesday 30th January, Imperial\nWomen\u2019s 2nd Fencing Team set o\ufb00 to\nduel the University of London Union\n(ULU) team. he opposing team was\nan unknown quantity, causing Imperial to keep their guard up. he match\nbegan with Clare Perry, Hannah Bryars and Slavina Georgieva fencing\nsabre.

From this a strict\npolicy on how feedback should be given back in 14 days was developed and\nlecture podcasts were introduced due to\nthis response. This year Paul and I gave\nan update to this response by awarding medals to the College on their pro-gress. The College received 3 woods,\n18 bronzes, 7 silvers and 7 golds. We\nalso gave 3 new recommendations and\nincluded the Union\u2019s strategic plan on\nhow we intend to improve your satisfaction over the next year.\nIn the 2012 NSS a new question was\nadded, which asked how satisfied final\nyears were with their students\u2019 union.\nAt this part I would like to make clear\nthat the Union is not just a bar, but is\nalso made up of around 330 clubs and\nsocieties (highest number for any students\u2019 union) and the 400+ academic\nreps (both UG and PG).\u201d\nFelix asked Hunt to comment on the\ncurrent rate at which students are filling\nLeft: the response rate in 2012 at this time. Right: the response rate this\nyear at the time of going to print. EEE have had everyone replying. This has\nbeen attributed to Lorraine Craig\u2019s encouragement.\nDriving Lessons For Imperial Students\n\u2022A special offer for Imperial students\nfrom Denis Smyth\n\u2022Driving Standards Agency (DSA)\nAccredited Instructor\n\u2022Mock Test Examiner\n5 Driving Lessons for\n\u00a395\n\"Denis is a fantastic teacher and knows how to get people from completely\ninexperienced and utterly hopeless driving up to the standard to pass their test. He is\nalways calm and his comments are constructive; his knowledge of London and his\nknack of engineering driving routes that test the learner make the lessons more than\nworth it. Since I have met him he has shown a great desire to offer cheaper lessons to\nImperial students and with the backing of other students I am more than happy to\nsupport him.\"\n- Alex Kendall, IC Union President 2010-11\nFree Mock Test from\nretired Driving Examiner\n\"I learned to drive in one of the busiest cities in the world.

Without hesitation.\"\n- Leon Vanstone, Aeronautical Engineering\nTo make inquiries and book lessons,\ncall 07808 610 898\nout the survey, and why the sudden in-crease. He replied: \u201cThe final years that\nare filling it in are currently destroying\nlast year\u2019s participation rate when you\nsee the College is at a 45.7%, compared to 15.9% last year. This is due\nto both the academic reps and departmental staff pushing it hard from when\nit opened. On top of that, the highest in\nthe country was 46.5%, so we could get\nthe highest turnout in the UK, if everyone keeps up the good work.\u201d He ended\nby reminding students to not \u201cbe neutral\u201d when completing the survey.\nThe NSS is the National Student Survey. It is completed by all final year\nundergraduates, and is a factor in many\nuniversity league tables. Imperial usually scores lower in satisfaction than\nother universities, particularly for the\nfeedback section. For the results to even\nbe counted, there are thresholds of re-sponses.\n\n"

A second year\nCivil Engineering student who wishes\nto remain anonymous due to the inevitable backlash told Trash Talk: \u201cI\ndon\u2019t really care whether or not it was\nhim.

However I promise\nlast should not be least! \u00a1Tr\u00e9!, as the\nlast album is called, features the drummer on the cover as well as carrying\nhis nickname. It was released a month\nbefore schedule, due to the band cancelling their promotion tours. Green\nDay, in accordance with their attempt\nto vary musical approaches on each\nalbum, decided to go for the stadium\nrock style, with the odd punk rock\nsong thrown in (a l\u00e1 Dookie). here\nis a more grand feeling to this album,\nespecially when in some songs when\nyou have the string arrangements and\nvocal harmonies.\nCarrying on the \u2018party\u2019 analogy from\nthe previous article, where the \u00a1Uno!\nand \u00a1Dos! where the pre-party and party music respectively, this is the music\nyou hear the morning after. hus it is\nAMS album of the week\nLocal Nativeshaveneverbeengroundbreaking. They stood out not because they were\ndoing something different to their peers, but\nbecause they were doing it quite well. Their\nsecond album, Hummingbird, does not break\nthe trend. It wears its influences on its sleeve\nand they\u2019re pretty much the same as last time\nround. It\u2019s a fairly well informed American\nindie record. Grizzly Bear, Animal Collective, a little Fleet Foxes, Grizzly Bear, a bit of\nBroken Social Scene and Grizzly Bear. Yeah alright, it\u2019s essentially just slightly\npoppier Grizzly Bear.\nThis is a very difficult record to review. There\u2019s nothing particularly bad about\nany of it. There\u2019s no bad songs to complain about. The songs all slot together\nnicely. It\u2019s a nice record. It\u2019s just it\u2019s nothing more than nice. At no point is it\nanything more or less than nice. There aren\u2019t really any good songs to rave about\neither. The whole thing is just fairly flat, and the level isn\u2019t high enough for that\nto keep your attention. The songs all blend together because you stop paying\nenough attention to tell them apart. To call it bland seems cruel. None of the\nindividual songs are bland, they\u2019re all fairly decent tracks. The problem is, the\ntotal is pretty bland.\nIn terms of song quality there are a few peaks. The first half of \u2018You & I\u2019 is\npretty, and the last minute or so of \u2018Black Spot\u2019 is pretty good. \u2018Mt. Washington\u2019\nis the best track here as far as I\u2019m concerned. In fact, I\u2019d say it\u2019s the only track\nwhich breaks the mould at all. It\u2019s not stylistically different, it\u2019s just really good.\nIt\u2019s the only track I can still see myself listening to in a few weeks time.\nIntermsofsongwritingtheyseemtohavematuredabit.BythisImeanthey\u2019ve\ncut out the exuberant bits. Gorilla Manor had the high-spirited \u2018Airplanes\u2019 and\n\u2018Sun Hands\u2019 to break up the flow, this has a few fairly dreary ballads. I suppose\nit\u2019s a bit more subtle and better thought out, but it\u2019s not as fun, and I don\u2019t think\nthat\u2019s a worthwhile trade. Hummingbird is not a big change though. Big fans\nof Gorilla Manor will probably find this quite enjoyable. Casual fans probably\nshouldn\u2019t bother.\n\u00a1Tres! \u00a1Uno! \u00a1Dos!\nMax Eggl reviews the final installment from Green Day\nsomewhat more melancholic and nostalgic (well I don\u2019t imagine you\u2019d be\nvery happy when you\u2019re cleaning up).\nIt all works, and the three albums do\njam together very well, even though\nthey are relatively di\ufb00erent.\nhis album had/will have two singles released o\ufb00 it. \u2018he Forgotten\u2019\nmay seem familiar to you, as it was\nchosen to be part of the soundtrack\nof The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn\n\u2013 Part 2. If it doesn\u2019t seem to ring a\nbell, Hooray! All the Green Day fans\nwho listen to this song, and watched\nthe movie will invariably connect it\nto that movie. Apart from its horrible\nassociations, it is a very good piece of\nmusic, a piano ballad that pulls at your\nheartstrings. Yet I feel that compared\nto the rest of the trilogy, the song is\nkind of boring to be honest. he other\nsingle (in fact the \ufb01rst official single)\no\ufb00 the album, is \u2018X-kid\u2019 which will only\nbe released on the 13th February. Now\nthis song is more like it. Typical Green\nDay, it has a great chord progression,\nstrong vocals and Mr. Cool does a\ngreat job on the drums. Certainly one\nof the top songs of this album!\nIt was very hard, trust me, excruciatingly so, for me to choose the best\nsongs that really describe this album.\nAll the songs were so really good, and\nhad something to o\ufb00er. However I did\nhave to have a choice. Honorary mentions go to; \u2018Brutal Love\u2019, for its grand\nstyle, \u2018Sex, Drugs and Violence\u2019 for\nthe amazing lyrics and \u2018Amanda\u2019 for\nthe best Green Day solo I have heard\nin a while. Now to the actual winners.\nBronze goes to \u2018Dirty Rotten Bastards\u2019,\na song reminding me of \u2018Jesus of Suburbia\u2019. A medley of di\ufb00erent songs that\nmesh so well. It is such a interesting\nsong, that is amazing to listen to and\nalso just fun. I could not face leaving it\no\ufb00 the list, because parts of this song\nare outstanding. For example, the\nbass line in the middle of the song is\ndivine. When I hear that I just wanna\njump up, and buy myself a bass and\nlearn that melody. Silver goes to \u2018Walk\nAway\u2019, a piece of music that starts relatively slowly, building up the tension,\nuntil with a bang it bursts into a beautiful song. he collaboration of White\nand Armstrong is very apparent in the\ncombination of White\u2019s guitar and\nArmstrong\u2019s vocals\noverlaid, and it works\nso well. If Green Day\nkeep churning out\nsongs like this, I will\nbe very happy. However they one up it,\nwith the winner of\nGold, \u2018Drama Queen\u2019.\nhis song is so beautiful it almost hurts.\nhe acoustic guitar,\nthe vocals, the piano\nnotes, the guitar solo.\nhis is where I use\nmy copyrighted term,\n\u201ceargasm\u201d. A pure ear-gasm. he topic of the\nsong is also great, having to deal with\ngrowing up/getting older, which I can\nimagine lots of Imperial students can\nassociate with. Not only do I think this\nis the song of the album, in fact I think\nthis is the song of the trilogy. his is\none of the best Green Day songs I have\nheard.\nIn my opinion, this is an absolute\nmasterpiece of an album. he perfect\nbalance of high energy songs, and slow\nballads it hits all the right notes (pun\nintended). he nostalgia that you feel\nin this album applies well to the trilogy as a whole. Everything must come\nto an end, but Green Day manage it in\nsuch a way that is absolutely stunning.\nI am sorry if this may seem somewhat\nclich\u00e9, but I give this album a 5/5,\nbecause it is so rockingly awesome.\nPlease, if you didn\u2019t buy the previous\nalbums, have a go at this one. If you\ndid follow my advice and got the other\nones, you know what you must do!\nAll in all the trilogy was a great set\nof albums. It really worked out, and\nGreen Day really outdid themselves.\nI really hope that they create more\nbeautiful music like this, to keep those\neargasms coming!\nGrouper\u2019sGhostlyMaritimeExplorations\nReviews for Grouper\u2019s The Man Who\nDied in His Boat (recorded in the same\nsessions as my favourite work of hers,\nDragging a Dead Deer up a Hill) have\nhad a bit of a tendency to focus on the\nconcept behind the album. Liz Harris\n(Grouper) has said that it\u2019s based on\na teenage memory of peering inside\nthe cabin of a wrecked ship, with the\nprevious occupant\u2019s belongings still\nstrewn around inside. I had intended\nnot to dwell on this too much but the\nevocation of the scene is really incred-ible; from the o\ufb00 Harris treats us to\ntape-echoed ambience that resembles\nwhispering winds over a blustering\nsea, and the whole album has a re\ufb02ective melancholy to its sound.\nWhilst it all really falls under pop\nambient, Grouper has managed to\nexplore a fairly wide range of soundscapes in her time, and all are dutifully represented here: from the completely delayed-out pieces, where a\nhandful of chords and vocal tones are\nextended and faded into nothing, to\nthe pop tracks with prominent, distinct melodies and lyrical vocals. his\nrelease certainly seems stronger than\nmost of the recent o\ufb00erings \u2013 I felt\nviolet replacement was a little lacking \u2013 which is perhaps not surprising considering the era it was pulled\nfrom, and provides some fantastic\nRoss Gray Music Editor\nexamples of the haunting simplicity and droned out sounds that have\nmade Grouper a pop ambient hero in\nrecent years.\nThe Man Who Died in His Boat is being released by Kranky on the 4th of\nFebruary 2013 alongside a reissue of\nDragging a Dead Deer up a Hill.\nLocal Natives: Hummingbird\nL\nStuart Masson\n\n"

With over 30,000 paintings\nand sculptures painstakingly digitised, the project represents a stunning resource for those unable to visit galleries in person. Using the same technology as street view, visitors to the website can stroll around galleries such as\nThe Metropolitan in New York \u00a9 and the Tate.\nThe detail with which one is able to view A-list artworks is astounding.\nIt is possible to examine Dali\u2019s brush strokes or the cracked paint in van\nGogh\u2019s Starry Night. This may very well be the future of art appreciation.\nDeviantART is the Facebook of art and undisputed champion\nof social networking amongst creative types. Users create\nprofiles and are then able to upload paintings, drawings and\npretty much every other genre you can conceive. In fact submissions range from traditional disciplines to pixel art and\nvideo, including, it must be said, a massive amount of anime\nand fan art.\nNow entering its 13th year, the website has over 25 million\nregistered members and grows by 160,000 uploads a day. There\nis a lot of dross generated, one suspects, by prepubescents.\nHowever, if you are prepared to search, there are some real\ngems and a lot of talent. Its also a good place to get critique\nabout your own work, however accomplished you are.\nThis project aims to \u201ccreate high-quality, most complete and\nwell-structured online repository of fine art\u201d. While this is\ngrammatically dubious, it is certainly a laudable ambition.\nAlthough still in beta development the website is based on a\nstandard wiki structure. The eventual aim is to make classical art\nmore comprehensible and accessible to the public and allow contemporary artists a conduit to that same community.\nWikipaintings is a not-for-profit organisation without the\nfunding available to, say, the Google Art Project. However,\nfree from commercial bias, the website also provides commentary and historical context on famous artworks built up\nby a similar approach to Wikipedia. In other words it is an art\nhistory student\u2019s dream.\nTumblrs do not have a great name. The regurgitation of cultural snippets is billed\nas a pretty vacuous activity, symptomatic of 21st Century consumer ambiva-lence, but there is always a role for the tasteful disseminator of other people\u2019s\nwork. Peteski is one such curator and his tumblr, This isn\u2019t happiness was recently listed in the top 100 most influential blogs.\nThe posts cover art, design, photography and poetry selected every day from\ndusty corners of the internet you never imagined existed. The strangely enchanting atmosphere created is one of occasionally sweet, always romantic, yet darkly and cynically morbid beauty. Erotic art is thrown in with pedantic diatribes\nagainst obscured malpractices in graphic design to create a strangely coherent\nphilosophy.\nThis website started by a pair of obsessive casual sketchers as\na light-hearted homage to the humble doodle has expanded\ninto a serious business. The website now showcases talented\nartworks found in moleskins, on the back of letters and on\nnapkins. It also features a blog, a shop selling bound compilations and T-shirts. The buzzing community of artists use\nthe simple concept to explore a surprisingly wide range of\ntangential interviews and posts.\nWith almost 1,000 members this buzzing little site is a great\nplace to show off your subconscious scrawling, or simply to\nbrowse the whimsical musings and pencil spider trails of\nothers. You could always save them for Doodle of the Week\nthough.\nWe need to mention at least one of the many excellent tutorial sites designed for beginner artists. Crtl+Paint, set up by\nIllustrator Matt Kohr, is as good an example as any. Although\nit focuses on digital art there are many others that will attempt to teach you anything from drawing to painting.\nMatt, however, has dedicated himself to producing quality\nvideos and help guides, up to industry standard, entirely off\nhis own back. He does however charge for some of his more\nadvanced tutorials.\nWhether this style of learning suits you or not you have to\nadmire to dedication of a single individual building up such\na recourse, or possibly just appreciate that illustrators spend\nlarge amounts of time out of work.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n"

For most\nof us, I suppose the in\ufb02uence from\npopular social media tools and cool\nhigh tech gadgets will probably relate us to multinational corporations\nlike Facebook, Microsoft and Google\nwhich have o\ufb03ces situated in that\nregion of San Francisco. Perhaps this\namount of information is more than\nenough to bore some of the more ignorant ones about tech-based entrepreneurship \u2013 but honestly, Silicon\nValley\u2019s history and its place at the\nforefront of innovation and enterprise\nhas more than what meets the eye.\nSilicon Valley, as its name suggests,\ncomprises a trove of internet or elec-tronics-based companies that dominate markets and set \u2018tech-fashions\u2019.\nBut while this name aptly describes\ncompanies like Facebook, Yahoo and\nApple, you should know many other\nkinds of corporations are also present\nin the same region. Take Gilead Science for instance. One of the top companies in the region, it is a research-based biopharmaceutical organization\nthat conducts medical-related R&D in\ndrugs and therapies. As you can see,\nit is hardly related to a silicon chip or\nsemiconductor manufacturing. So,\nwhy do we use the term \u201cSilicon\u201d?\nWilliam Shockley, one of the \u2018founding fathers\u2019 of Silicon Valley is the reason behind its nickname, due to his\ninnovations in the design of the semi-conductor. But its actual beginnings\nreach all the way back to early 20th\ncentury, when experimentation with\nelectronics was taking place. Subsequently by the 1970s, while semiconductors contributed a major portion\nof the area\u2019s economy, its fame as the\nregion where computers and graphical user interfaces were born soon\ndrew more companies and venture\ncapitalists into the region for business.\nAnd right before the dot-com crash,\nthe Silicon Valley found itself to be\nthe centre of an explosion of internet-based businesses.\nToday, Silicon Valley is no longer\nconsidered just the centre of silicon\nchip manufacturers, its name is synonymous with world-class innovation\nand technological progress \u2013 a far cry\nfrom its early beginnings.\nAnd now, as Imperial students, a select few of us will have the chance to\nexperience it \ufb01rst-hand.\nA month from now will mark the\nstart of the International Insight Series to Silicon Valley, San Francisco,\nwhere a series of high-key appointments will be conducted within the\nworld\u2019s fastest growing hub of cutting\nedge, high-tech companies. King\u2019s\nCollege Business Club and Imperial\nEntrepreneurs have jointly organised\nthis trip to provide Imperial students\nthe opportunity to visit some of the\nmost prestigious companies existing\nin Silicon Valley today.\nWith presentations, discussions and\nnetworking just beside some of the\nmost successful start-up ventures in\nthe world, this trip is promised to be\nthat ticket you have been hoping for\nto get through the door for a promising career in entrepreneurship while\nof course \u2013 soaking in the sun on the\nother side of the Atlantic.\nhe application process is really sim-ple. To apply, you will have to forward\nyour CV to zhong.lim12@imperial.\nac.uk and answer the following question in less than 200 words: \u201cWhat\nwould you hope to gain from attending this trip?\u201d he deadline for online\napplications at http://imperialentre-preneurs.com/silicon-valley-trip/ is\nmidnight on the 4th of February 2013.\nFor further details please visit\nimperialentrepreneurs.com\nW\nIdentify your Dream Team!\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all heard the phrase\n\u2018two heads are better than one\u2019. Seems\npretty obvious, right? By this logic,\nit follows that three heads are better\nthan two, four better than three and\nso on. Unfortunately, when it comes\nto startups, the equation is not quite\nso simple. Finding the right team is a\nvery long and di\ufb03cult task, and one\nmistake could jeopardise the entire\nbusiness. Ed Catmull, co-founder of\nPixar, summarises it perfectly: \u201cIf you\ngive a good idea to a mediocre team,\nthey\u2019ll screw it up. But if you give a\nmediocre idea to a great team, they\u2019ll\nmake it work.\u201d\nhere are two main aspects to look\nat to build such a great team; skills and\nattitude.\nTogether, the ideal team will have a\nbroad enough set of skills to be able to\ncover any task that needs to be done,\nbut enough of an overlap so that the\nteam communicates well and the idea\ndoesn\u2019t crash and burn the second one\nperson leaves.\nFor most projects, the ideal team\nwill have the following members:\nhe Visionary: the person who\ncame up with the idea and is willing to\nput everything behind it. his is usually the person that runs the show, but\nalso motivates the team and makes\nsure all bases are covered\nhe Brains: this person brings the\nidea to life using technical or other\nspecialist skills.\nhe Logistics: once the idea has\nbeen brought to life, this person brings\nit out into the wild and makes sure it\nreaches the target market.\nhe Salesman: the one who makes\nsure that once it reaches the target market, people are convinced to\nspend money on it.\nhe Financier: the person that\ntracks the cash \ufb02ow, making sure that\nenough money is being made and not\ntoo much is being spent.\nOf course this will all vary depending on the business; one based on a\nbrand will need more logistics and\nsales power, whereas one based on a\nnew invention or discovery may need\nmore brains behind it.\nDespite the common misconcep-tion, skilled people are actually not\ntoo di\ufb03cult to \ufb01nd, especially in an\ninstitution like Imperial College. he\nmain challenge comes in \ufb01nding people with the right attitude.\nFirst and foremost, everyone in the\nteam must share a passion for the\nbusiness. his is what drives the sleepless nights and initial low pay before\nthe idea develops and can start making money. he visionary will naturally have the most passion, but the ultimate goal and belief that the product\nwill bring value to the end users must\nbe prevalent throughout.\nBeyond that is the work ethic and\npersonality \ufb01t with the team. We have\nall had experience with lazy members\nand those that constantly bring the\nteam down. Even if they have the perfect skill set and are brilliant at what\nthey do, they will undoubtedly disturb\nthe harmony of the rest of the group\nand could potentially jeopardise the\nwhole project.\nHowever, it should be noted that\nthere is a \ufb01ne line between a naysayer\nand a critical thinker. Naysayers are\nthe pessimists that \ufb01nd fault wherever\npossible, but offer no reasonable solution or coping mechanism. his is a\nclear sign that they do not believe in\nthe idea and should be kicked out as\nsoon as possible. Critical thinkers, i.e.\nthose who can make realistic outlooks\nand prevent overly ambitious and\nfrivolous actions, are essential. Entrepreneurs are naturally optimistic,\nand the Visionary in particular would\nbe blinded by it. A good critical eye\ncan rein the team in and prevent early\nburnout.\nSo how do you \ufb01nd your dream\nteam? hat\u2019s fairly simple for most of\nus because the chances are your perfect match is somewhere in Imperial.\nIt\u2019s just a matter of joining the right\nsocieties and talking to the right people to \ufb01nd them. Beyond that, LinkedIn and personal contacts need to be\nutilised to \ufb01nd the right people. It isn\u2019t\neasy and can severely delay the development of an idea, but once you are\nsurrounded by people who share the\nsame vision, there will be nothing that\ncan get in your way.\nNitin Nihalani Writer\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 01 FEBRUARY\n12\nThink about the C word\nStudent Volunteering Week \u2013 10 - 16 February\nonday 4th February is National\nCancer Awareness Day and the\nten-month-and-twenty-seven day anniversary of my\nfather\u2019s death from \u2013 I need hardly say\nit \u2013 cancer.\nAccording to Cancer Research UK,\nroughly 325,000 people were diagnosed with some form of \u2018malignant\nneoplasm\u2019 in 2010. But how helpful is\nthat statistic, or indeed any other \ufb01gure related to cancer? he sheer incidence of the disease implies that it is\nboth predictable and prosaic. Cancer\nis neither of those things.\nFirst as to the predictability. Cancer shares all psychotic irrationality\nof tyranny. It cats people about. Initially it works with stealth, frequently\nannouncing itself with a malevolent\n\ufb02ourish in the young and seemingly\n\ufb01t, consigning them to a hamster\nwheel of radiotherapy, chemotherapy,\nsurgery, yet more radiotherapy, another form of surgery... Sometimes treatment will manage to block the wheel,\nand su\ufb00erers will be taunted with\ndaydreams of remission, which might\nlast for months, years, even a lifetime.\nStudent Volunteering Week, brought\nto you by the NUS and your very own\nImperial Hub is a week aimed at cel-ebrating, inspiring and supporting\nstudent volunteering.\nSunday 10th\nIf you\u2019ve been waiting for the right\ntime to get involved with Soup Run\u2026\nhere it is! We hope this will be the biggest Soup Run Imperial\u2019s Soup Run\nsociety has ever done.\nMonday 11th\nFlash mob of kindness! Keep an eye\nopen for extremely lovely and happy\npeople making kind and generous gestures throughout the day\u2026 there will\nbe dance, there will be music\u2026 there\nwill be free hugs and more.\nTuesday 12th\nPancake day!! here will be lots of delicious pancake-oriented volunteering\nopportunities \u2013 pancake party for elderly people in Kensington Olympia,\nKate Pumphrey wants you to remember cancer awareness day\nAll too often this is proven an illusion,\nwith cancer careering back into the\npicture bearing a \ufb01stful of aces.\nAnd there is nothing mundane\nabout this disease, despite its preva-lence. Chemotherapy \u2013 still one of\nmedicine\u2019s most commonly deployed\nsolutions \u2013 is chemical warfare at its\nmost vicious. Extreme exhaustion,\nweakness, consistent nausea, depres-sion, profound constipation \u2013 these\nare the inevitable results of treat-ment; many also lose their hair or suffer other random un-pleasantries (in\nmy father\u2019s case a raw sensitization\nof the nerves on his \ufb01ngertips, which\n\u2013extraordinary \u2013 was only eased by a\nGerman cream made for cow udders).\nAnd, because chemotherapy is delivered in cyclical bouts \u2013 usually every\nthree weeks or so \u2013 just as soon as the\npatient has recovered from the worst,\nthey have to return for more. It\u2019s hard\nto believe that this is the remedy \u2013 the\nfriend, not the foe.\nhe impact of cancer in a family is\nfelt at every level. Walk into our home\na year ago and you may well have\nthought you had entered a pop-up\npharmacy. Anti-emetics, anti-depres-sants, proleukin, prolacta, carbopl-atin, temazepam (Scrabble is now a\nbreeze), sleeping pills by the bedfull\u2026\nPainkiller? Do you seek Astral or\nVolterol or an alphabetic intermedi-ary? Low immune system? Take a tablespoon of Manuka honey (sourced\nfrom some obscure bee colony in one\nof the remoter spots of the Far East,\nthen retailed at obscene expense in\ncentral London). And the strangest associations are made: I look at a\nMagnum ice cream, and think not of\nsummer and sunshine but of its bene\ufb01ts to a skeletally thin man lacking\nsaliva glands.\nYou might expect the horror of the\nsituation to make life very dramatic,\nbut mostly the path of the long-term\nsick is one of dull \ufb02atness. It\u2019s tedious,\nunremitting and in\ufb01nitely wearing.\nhere are frenzied lurches \u2013 the scan\nresults, say, or the epileptic \ufb01t caused\nby the drugs \u2013 but even those tend to\nbe smothered in the wishiwashiness of\na hospital\u2019s grey-blueness.\nIf it\u2019s hard to be gracious there are,\nnevertheless, those that are grace-ful. In my case, some of the winners\nemerged from the most surprising\nquarters, like the corporate law \ufb01rm\n(my then-employer), that more or\nless let me work part-time while I was\nnursing dad at the end of his life, and\nthe GP, who dared to speak of \u201cin\ufb01nite\nlove, in\ufb01nite benevolence\u201d. Above all,\nhowever, it was my friends that rescued me from despair. Calls, cards,\nmessages, \ufb02owers, cakes, invitations\nto parties, pubs and clubs\u2026 How good\npeople are at being friends! How much\nit matters.\nBe aware on Monday. Check for\nlumps, bumps, and moles; pay attention to any other strange changes in\nyour body. Maybe send a message to\nsomeone you know for whom the Cword is personal.

    "content": "SimCity (Not 5)\nJosh Price givesushisthoughtsonlastweekend\u2019sSimCitybeta\nt\u2019s been almost a year since I\ndiscovered the new SimCity\nwas announced. Was it really,\n\ufb01nally, possible that Maxis\nwere making a new game,\nwith that one feature that was missing from the previous versions? Could\nthis really be the dawn of curved roads?\nSpeculation aside, I was particularly\npleased to \ufb01nd that I had an invitation\nto the beta, last weekend. Naturally,\nwhat follows is not a full feature re-view, there will of course be changes,\nbut I still had a fun in the limited hour\nthat the beta provided. Plenty of time\nto start oppressing the masses and begin industrialisation creating an idyllic\nsuburban utopia.\nFor those curious to know what this\nis, SimCity is a \u2018reboot\u2019 of the series\nwhich is about, surprise surprise, city\nbuilding. he gameplay is fairly simple.\nA network of roads acts as the core of\nyour city, from simple streets to 8 lane\nhighways. Development is controlled\nby zones, residential, commercial and\nindustrial. here are many services you\nneed to manage too; Electricity, Water, Health, Rubbish, etc, etc. here\u2019s\na whole list of needs you need to bal-ance, in order to make your city functional and to keep your Sims happy.\nAs the game progresses, new options\nopen up to you, including better transport systems, landmarks and the like.\nIf you\u2019re successful, you should slowly\nnotice your small country-style town\nof shacks, develop into a huge megalopolis of gleaming glass spires.\nBut what of new features? It\u2019s been\n10 years since the last game, SimCity\n4, came out (Societies? Mention it\nnot!), and there are plenty of additions\nto boot in the new game. Zoning, for\nexample, is now free and only necessary along roads themselves. hank-fully , this means no more \u201cno access\u201d\nsigns springing up, or worrying about\n\ufb01lling up those awkward little gaps.\nOne of the biggest changes however is\nthe level of increased customization.\nAny service, aesthetic, or general\n\u2018functional\u2019 structure you place\ncan now be modi\ufb01ed. Is your\ns c h o o l over-enrolled?\nB u i l d more classrooms!\nIs your wind farm not meeting your\npower demands? Add more turbines!\nhere are other neat features along\nthis line too. he old radius system\nfor buildings seems to have been done\naway with mostly, and there\u2019s no worry\nabout taking up grid squares to play.\nAnd yes, \ufb01nally, curved roads; you\u2019re\nno longer con\ufb01ned to building towns\nof a similar style to Milton Keynes.\nOne other new feature that is worth\nmentioning is the increased regional\nplay, sadly absent from the beta. In previous versions of the game, you created\nyour city in a region, but didn\u2019t necessarily need to interact with any others.\nWith the exception of SimCity 2000\u2019s\nNetwork Edition, the game was entirely\nsingle player. In this version, however,\nMaxis have added the option of having you play with other people. hese\ncan be complete strangers, or just\nyour friends. he level of interactivity\nbetween cities seems to be much im-proved; you can share certain services\nand the like. One other new feature\nseems to be \u201cGreat Works\u201d, which the\nbeta excitedly promotes as something\nfor mayors to work together on. Special sites are given over in a region, to\nthese, and can consist of things such\nas a shared solar farm or international\nairport.\nIt\u2019s not all nice and rosy however.\nDepressingly, the game does require\nthe presence of an always online internet connection. Maxis have stated that\nthis is to ensure a better game experi-ence, and that some of the simulations\nrequired by the game are required for\nplay. he lack of a 100% offline singleplayer mode is disappointing, especially for those still without constant\nuninterrupted access to the internet.\nNot only this, but it raises the question\nof the reliability of EA\u2019s servers. here\nwere some issues in connecting to the\nbeta initially, though this was to be ex-pected, however it raises the question\nas to how long support for the title will\nlast.\nIn addition to all this, there were a\nfew features seemingly absent. While\nthe version I played was a beta, there\nwere clear signs\nof things\navailable in the full version, hidden under a \u201cNot in Beta\u201d tag. Long term fans\nof the series will be saddened by the absence of certain features. Perhaps most\nnotably, these include subways and\nfarms; I can only hope they aren\u2019t speci\ufb01cally left out to be included as later\ndownloadable content. One other feature that seemed to be annoying was\nthe limited size of the city. Maxis have\ncon\ufb01rmed that this isn\u2019t restricted to\nthe beta, and is a design and technical\nchoice. hey have stated that this will\nimprove regional play, giving no \u201ccorrect\u201d city design. I was quite a fan of\ncreating as large as possible metropolises in SimCity 4 and I can imagine this\nwill be a common complaint amongst\nother fans of the original game.\nOverall though, my experience of the\nbeta was very enjoyable. After playing\nfor an hour it\u2019s nice to see that the attention to detail in graphics is present\nin the new Glassbox engine, and you\nare no longer con\ufb01ned to an isometric\nview. You can play the entire game from\na tilt-shift perspective, and if you\u2019ve got\na computer with a decent amount of\npower under the hood, you can expect\nto be treated to some very nice looking\ncityscapes. he statistics mode is pre-sent, as in the previous game, which\nallows you to study di\ufb00erent aspects of\nyour city in almost minute detail. here\nare various graphs present which let\nyou look at things, from happiness to\nlocal pollution. With the new engine\nthese can be shown directly in your\ncity, providing some strangely satisfying scenarios. For example, try watching the \ufb02ow of power to your buildings\nafter you\u2019ve built a power plant.\nOnline qualms aside, I am de\ufb01nitely\ngiving this title some more interest\nnow I\u2019ve had the chance to play it. As\na major fan of the original series, I\u2019m\nlooking forward to the release of this\na lot more, and would recommend it to others, or those\nlooking to try something\nnew.\nI\nGAMES Games Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 01 FEBRUARY\n42\nNow with 100% more 3D...\n...200% more curves...\n... and 1000% more Japansourced city destruction!\n\n"

Costing you around \u00a3750, it should only really be considered by\nthe Apple obsessed or by those with serious amounts of data.\nTwitter Porn\nSix second porn clips were added to Twitter, via the app Vine. Invariably something quite explicit appeared in everyone\u2019s vine feed, due to\nit being an editor\u2019s pick. The hashtag \u201cdildoplay\u201d became quite popular on Twitter, but the video was almost instantly removed.\nThe Graphene Flagship\nThe EU has recently released its science funding, and announced it\nwould give a budget of 1bn euros to the University of Cambridge who\nare working with Nokia to bring graphene to everyday electronics.\nBendy phones like Nokia\u2019s Morph may be more than just a concept!\nOffice 365 (2013)\nMicrosoft has launched a new iteration of Office, redesigning it to\nutilise touch screen based controls as well as Skype\u2019s video chat. There\nare also several other features, which can be added via the app store.\nThere is a one time purchase for \u00a3110 (will be cheaper for students) or\na subscription model for \u00a380 pounds per annum, which includes 60\nminutes of Skype calling as well as more Skydrive storage.\nBlackberry 10\nAfter their market share collapsed from 19% in 2010 to 4% Blackberry\nreleased their long awaited make-or-break operating system. The Z10\nand Q10 are the flagship devices, the former making its world debut in\nthe UK. Blackberry\u2019s shares fell more than 6% after the launch.\nMax Eggl and Jason Parmar Tech Editors\nt\u2019s not unfair to call Microsoft\na reactive company, i.e. they\nfollow trends and build on\nothers innovations, it\u2019s in their\nhistory.\nExcel was an improved spreadsheet\nof existing VisiCalc, Word was an\nimproved word processor of existing\nMicroPro and Internet Explorer was\nan improved web browser of existing\nNCSA Mosaic. Even Microsoft\u2019s \ufb01rst\nbig commercial success in the mass\nmarket, MS-DOS was built on, like\nApple, the investment in GUI that\nXerox developed.\nMicrosoft have continued to be reactive to this day and have a reputation\nfor successfully recognising growth\nmarkets, acquiring \ufb01rms and developing products more successful than\nmany of their competitors (with a few\nexceptions).\nXbox 360, for example, announced\nthey\u2019ve shipped over 70 million units\nin October 2012, not bad for a company who only entered the console\nmarket in 2001.\nOver the last 30 years Microsoft\nhave well and truly demonstrated that\nthere\u2019s nothing wrong with being a\nreactive or a \u201cfollowing\u201d company, as\nlong as you do it well. heir reactive\nstrategies have earned them the honour to be one of very few companies in\nthe world to have over a billion users\nworldwide and is why they still are one\nof the top 10 companies in the world.\nSo why are they so interesting now?\nWhat\u2019s changed?\nWell, we are currently seeing the\nmost radical change in the Redmond\nbased company\u2019s history. hey\u2019ve fundamentally changed what they companies message to world is, released\nradical new products and have meticulously integrated all their services, all\nwithin the last 12 months.\nAnd the reason? Well it has something to do with the fact that Microsoft are reacting to what they believe is\na fundamental shift in the market and\ncomputing demands.\nhe world has moved on from\nBill Gates\u2019 famous BHAG to have \u201ca\ncomputer on every desk and in every\nhome\u201d. hat goal has mostly been\nachieved in the western world today,\nand technology, never standing still,\nappears to be inching ever closer to\nthe \u201cpost-PC era\u201d. Just this month it\nwas announced that worldwide PC\nsales were down 5% compared with\nyear and most believe that the downward trend will continue at an increasingly rapid pace.\nBut it\u2019s not like Microsoft never prepared for the death of the PC. In 2002\nBill Gates released the tablet PC thinking it would change the world and be\nthe future, but it failed spectacularly.\nhere\u2019s lots of cited reasons for the\nfailure, e.g. primitive software, but\nthe real reason is that Microsoft just\nisn\u2019t like their Cupertino rivals Apple, they\u2019re not a proactive company,\nthey\u2019re reactive.\nMicrosoft therefore needed someone else to create a new growth mar-ket, a market they could build upon for\nthe future success of their company. So\nin steps the world\u2019s best marketer and\ninnovator, Apple CEO, Steve Jobs. In\n2010 he released the iPad and claimed\nit would \u201cchange the world\u201d. Change\nthe world it did, the world went into\na frenzy for the product, growing the\ntablet market by 250% in 2011 and increasing current sales projections to\n165.9m this year alone.\nIt\u2019s this market demand that kicked\nMicrosoft the most and it\u2019s the one\nthey have reacted to the strongest.\nBut choosing to distinguish themselves from their wealthier rivals, they\nhaven\u2019t gone directly into the \u201ctablet\u201d market and have instead claimed\nthey are creating their own innovative\nmarket, the \u201chybrid\u201d market. Regardless if the two market are the same or\ndi\ufb00erent, Microsoft appear 100% sure\nthat it will be the future for computing devices and have attacked all guns\nblazing.\nwe are currently seeing\nthe most radical change in\nthe Redmond\nbased company\u2019s history\nAnd by all guns blazing, I basically\nmean Microsoft went HARD. Not\nonly did they not even contemplate\ngoing home, but they literally went\nhard by releasing their \ufb01rst piece of\nreal hardware.\nIn this last six months alone Microsoft released: new hardware hybrids\nwith the Surface RT & Surface Pro,\na radical new operating system with\nWindows 8, an increasingly popular\nand innovative mobile operating system with Windows Phone 8, a completely overhauled cloud and subscription based O\ufb03ce Suite with O\ufb03ce\n365, a \u201cseamlessly integrated\u201d cloud\nbased storage service with SkyDrive\nand to tie it all together they not only\nintegrated the functions of all of their\nservices but they completely rebranded the entire companies products and\npublicity material with new logos,\nwebsites and design templates.\nWith a new Xbox 720 on the horizon\nand Microsoft\u2019s Bing search grabbing\nmarket share o\ufb00 Google every day, it\u2019s\nno wonder people are calling this Microsoft\u2019s biggest change ever, they\u2019re\ngoing hard.\nBut perhaps one of the most interesting emerging news topics about\nMicrosoft going hard is their rumoured investment of $3bn into soon-to-be private Dell. It\u2019s incredibly rare\nfor Microsoft to tap into their $67bn\ncash reserve so chances are Microsoft\nare thinking seriously about going into\nhardware. his makes sense for Microsoft, as CEO Steve Ballmer repeatedly\nstated at the launch of the Microsoft\nSurface that they believed that success\nrelied on the strength of hardware and\nsoftware working together. So it\u2019s possible that in the near future Microsoft\nmay no longer just be a software company and may actually become, much\nlike Apple, a \u201cdevice company\u201d, e\ufb00ectively going from Microsoft to \u2018Microhardandsoft\u2019.\nSo although Microsoft\u2019s pro\ufb01ts are\ndown 4% on last year, it\u2019s evident that\nthey aren\u2019t standing still. In keeping\nwith their reactive follower history,\nMicrosoft have gone all in for what\nthey think is the future of computing.\nhey\u2019ve bet almost everything on the\nuptake of their new operating systems\nand the success of the tablet/hybrid\nmarket. It\u2019s a bold move and only time\nwill tell if they can successfully win\nover business and consumers. But\nwith the \u201cpost-PC era\u201d drawing ever\ncloser, a radical change was needed. I\nfor one think Microsoft have reacted\nwell, they\u2019ve stepped up and have gone\nhard.\nToo Long, Didn\u2019t Read\nMicrosoft are going so hard that\nhome is just a \ufb01ctional concept.\nhey\u2019ve radically changed their fundamental strategy by mixing hardware with software across all platforms (phones, tablets/hybrids and\ndesktops) and they\u2019ve released bare\nnew products including Windows 8,\nWindows Phone 8, O\ufb03ce 365 and\nSurface in the last 6 months.\nhey\u2019re investing everything into\nthe success of the hybrid market,\ntheir new software and their new\nhardware. his is all in the hope that\nconsumers and business will continue to love them forever, or continue\nto grudgingly accept them.\nSo not only are they going hard\nfrom a \u201cwere releasing loads of new\nstu\ufb00\u201d POV but their actually going\nhard into hardware with Surface,\nXbox and a potential acquisition of\nDell. If it all goes ahead maybe they\u2019ll\nneed to rebrand again, from Microsoft to MicroSofthenHard (but\nperhaps that\u2019s too much of a double\nentendre).\nI\nMicrosoft\u2019s rebranding was too badass for an Obama \u201ccool story bro\u201d\n\n"

But who else to turn to than\nQuentin Tarantino? With his latest\nfeature \ufb01lm Django Unchained, he\nhas delivered a serious labour of love.\nAlready being tipped as a strong\ncontender for the Golden Globes,\nDjango Unchained is Tarantino\u2019s\nchance to go full Spaghetti Western. Of course, it\u2019s not that simple.\nhis, for want of a better phrase, is\na Southern Spaghetti Western - one\nthat tackles slavery head on.\nAnd this celluloid slavery isn\u2019t\nsimply a background element that\u2019s\nroutinely passed over. Here it\u2019s ugly,\nit\u2019s raw and it\u2019s very real. here has\nbeen talk among critics that this \ufb01lm\nful\ufb01ls some kind of adolescent desire to slip racial slurs through the\ncensors, and while this is un\ufb02inching, fast-paced and kinetic, it\u2019s never\nplayed for poking fun at race or slav-ery. Instead, much like Inglourious\nDjango Unchained\nDirector: Quentin Tarantino\nScreenwriter: Quentin Tarantino\nStarring: Jamie Foxx, Christoph\nWaltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry\nWashington, Samuel L. Jackson\nBasterds was Tarantino\u2019s \ufb01lmic revenge on Hitler, here it\u2019s his revenge\non the slave trade.\nActing almost as a companion\npiece to the fast and loose historical nazi-scalping adventure, Django\nUnchained again takes a past setting,\nhere the America of 1858. he plot\ncentres around slave Django (played\nin a winning performance by Jamie\nFoxx) searching the Deep South for\nhis beloved wife Broomhilda (Kerry\nWashington). However, Christoph\nWaltz steals the show once again following his turn as the diabolical Col.\nHans Landa in Basterds. As dentist turned bounty hunter Dr. King\nSchultz, Waltz is at all times hugely\nthreatening with the capacity for violence and also an immensely pleasant character.\nDjango and Schultz (whose horse,\nFritz, may be even more of a scene\nstealer) buddy up as they traverse the\nland as a bounty-hunting duo. It\u2019s\nnot long before the duo come face-to-face with vile plantation owner\nCalvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).\nMuch focus has been placed on DiCaprio\u2019s turn as the rotten toothed\nvillain. While you can tell he\u2019s having the time of his life, drawling it up\nlike nobody\u2019s business, so are the rest\nof the ensemble players, and it\u2019s fantastic to watch.\nI could wax lyrical about the\nstrength of the cast: Kerry Washington brings a more-than-convincing\nbilingual turn as Broomhilda, and\nSamuel L. Jackson\u2019s long awaited onscreen return to the works of Tarantino pretty much gives everyone a\nrun for their money, portraying Candie\u2019s nefarious and wholly loyal slave,\nStephen.\nOther than a fantastic cast and\nits colourful historical setting, it\u2019s\nthe regular tension, much like in\nBasterds, that is at once unbearable\nand gripping. One major scene featuring the majority of the main cast\nratchets up the stress to an almost\nungodly degree before letting go.\nAnd let go it does.\nIndeed, it\u2019s not a \ufb01lm for the\nsqueamish (this is, after all, Quentin Tarantino we\u2019re talking about).\nBlood splatters as freely as ever, and\nthe \ufb01lm is un\ufb02inching in portraying\nthe barbarity of the slave trade. In response to the standard questioning\nof the amount of violence present,\nTarantino has spoken of his desire\nto not gloss over the issues at hand.\nSpeaking to the Guardian, the director explained that \u201chowever bad\nthings get in the movie, a lot worse\ns*** actually happened.\u201d Nevertheless, Django\u2019s rampage through\nthe Deep South may call for a little\ncringing.\nIt may also call for a toilet break if\nyou\u2019ve poorly judged your hydration\nbefore sitting down to watch it. It\u2019s a\nreliably lengthy beast, clocking in at\nnearly three hours. However, while\nthe \ufb01lm never outstayed its welcome,\nthere were a couple of detours in a\nkind of \u2018whirlwind slavery tour\u2019 that\ndidn\u2019t quite jam. his includes a sequence where Django and Schultz\nencounter some fanatic racists. he\nscene is played for laughs, but at least\nto me the joke went on a little too\nlong. he folks at the screening thoroughly seemed to enjoy it though,\nand it brought some of the evening\u2019s\nbiggest laughs.\nEvents also seemed to build up to\na natural climax, before it transpired\nthat there was a good twenty minutes left on top of this. he \ufb01nal act\nfeatures some memorable moments\n(including an explosive sterling cameo from a certain individual) but I\ncan\u2019t help but shake the feeling that\nthe \ufb01nal sequence comes sneaking\nup out of nowhere.\nIn keeping with the genre, naturally Spaghetti Western composer\nlegend Ennio Morricone turns up\nto compose a original piece, but it\u2019s\nthe anachronistic soundtrack that\nsings. Rick Ross, the Te\ufb02on Don\nhimself, lends his dulcet tones for\none scene, but it\u2019s a combination of\nTupac Shakur and James Brown that\nbrought the house down when paired\nwith a climactic set-piece of near orgiastic violence.\nIt\u2019s reliably over-the-top, funny and\nbrutal. Out of the two historical Tarantino \ufb01lms however, I\u2019d probably\njust choose Basterds over Django, if\nonly because I personally preferred\nthe greater prevalence of tense dialogue over Django\u2019s action set-pieces.\nIf you\u2019re a fan, it\u2019s essential. If you\naren\u2019t sold on this particular brand,\nthen this is unlikely to sway your\nopinion. If you\u2019re stuck in the middle,\nthen delving head\ufb01rst into this tale\nof southern slavery is well worth it.\nFoxx is off the chain\nMatt Colvin Coffee Break Editor\n2013 Screen Actors\nGuild Awards Winners\nBest Cast:\nArgo\nBest Lead Actor:\nDaniel Day-Lewis\nLincoln\nBest Lead Actress:\nJennifer Lawrence\nSilver Linings Playbook\nBest Supporting Actor:\nTommy Lee Jones\nLincoln\nBest Supporting Actress:\nAnne Hathaway\nLes Mis\u00e9rables\nThe teeth.

Wrong. The\nCoronet Cinema is a hidden gem\nthat is not to be missed. Independent cinemas are much less numerous than they used to be as the big\ncinema chains are able to offer more\nfilms at more times in more loca-tions. Those that survive are generally forced to find some niche to fit\ninto; foreign movies or arts films,\netc; unable to afford the high prices\nfor studio blockbusters on the limited showings and audience sizes they\ncan manage.\nNot so the Coronet Cinema.\nThough they only manage four\nfilms at any one time and can only\nhave limited showings each day\non their two screens, the Coronet\nmanages to survive in an industry\nwhere big business usually wears\nthe crown. You would assume then\nthat the prices they charge must be\nextortionate; directly on Notting\nHill Gate, trying to survive, how\ncould they not be? Well I\u2019m not sure\nbut at \u00a37.50 a ticket they manage to\nbeat the price of most top cinemas.\nPerhaps the lack of the 3D and HFR\ngimics of modern multiscreen keeps\ntheir costs down. So what\u2019s the\ndrawback? Well so far as I can tell\nthere isn\u2019t one! An old theatre building means that both screens are in a\nbeautiful rooms that feel more like\ngoing to a play than a film and the\nquirky \u201cNo Smoking\u201d and \u201cComing\nSoon\u201d ads that seem to have been\nthere since the early 90s give the\nplace a nostalgic feel that really gets\nyou in the mood.\nIf that\u2019s not enough for you, why\nnot go on their student night? On\na Monday it makes a great alternative to Orange Wednesdays, especially for anyone that maybe plays\nsport on a Wednesday afternoon.\nThe price then goes down to \u00a33.50\na ticket! And you get your popcorn\nfor a whopping \u00a31.50. Or, you could\nchoose to eschew the popcorn and\nhave a cheeky glass of wine or any\nother kiosk item on the same offer.\nSo a large glass of wine, and The\nHobbit for a fiver? I\u2019d pay more than\nthat in quite a lot of pubs, and I\u2019d\nprobably get a worse seat too!\nCheck out what\u2019s on at:\nwww.coronet.org\n103 Notting Hill Gate\nLondon\nKaty Bettany Film Editor\nHyde Park on Hudson\nDirector: Roger Michell\nScreenwriter: Richard Nelson\nStarring: Bill Murray, Laura Linney,\nSamuel West, Olivia Coleman\nIt is sometime in June 1939, at Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s (Murray) private es-tate, upstate New York. Europe is on\nthe brink of war, and King George V\n(West) and Queen Elizabeth (Cole-man) are about to become the \ufb01rst\nBritish monarchs ever to visit America, in a bid to improve relations and\nconvince America to assist them in\na War that was understood to be in-evitable. Most of the \ufb01lm takes place\nduring the weekend of the Royal visit;\nthe rest documents FDR\u2019s dalliances\nwith several women other than his\nwife Eleanor, (including the \ufb01lm\u2019s\nnarrator, Daisy (Linney), his sixth\ncousin, intimate friend, and later,\nlover).\nAt times, the screenplay is too\nobvious and scripting lacks punch.\nLinney\u2019s narration can be melodramatic and cliched - in fact, overall her\ncharacter is not much of a testament\nto Linney\u2019s skill as an actress. Daisy is\nplain, and altogether quite dull when\ncompared to the eclectic Eleanor,\nwho in contrast shines as the show-wife; columnist and closet lesbian.\nIn a \ufb01lm that was always going to be\ncompared with the Academy Award\nwinning \u2018he King\u2019s Speech\u2019, West\nand Coleman had big shoes to \ufb01ll in\nplaying the monarchs. West plays the\nstruggling George well, portraying a\nman desperate to step out from underneath his brothers shadow; and be\nthe kind of King he believes the British public deserve. Coleman is enter-taining, but no Bonham Carter, and\nher obsession with the secret meaning behind food-types and occasional\noutbursts at her likable husband do\nnot endear her.\nMurray is the star of the \ufb01lmplaying the invalid President with\ngreat timing and a jaunty good tem-per. In a touching moment shared\nin Roosevelt\u2019s study, the two men\ncompare ailments: the King with his\nnow infamous stutter, and Roosevelt\nwith his useless Polio crippled legs.\nRoosevelt bolsters the King\u2019s con\ufb01dence, revealing that his disability is\nnot seen and ignored, but simply not\nseen: the American people choose\nwhat they want to see in a leader. We\nsee Murray provide a sort of father\ufb01gure to the young King in the central scene of the \ufb01lm.\nDaisy\u2019s relationship with the President is intended to be an exploration of the intimacies and nuances of\nfriendship, but falls short. When FDR\nreceives what has been described as\n\u2018cinema\u2019s most PG-rated handjob\u2019\n(not an exaggeration), his relationship with his distant cousin moves\ninto the icky league; and Linney\u2019s\nnight-time forest running pushes it\ninto the melodramatic. More than\nthis though, is the odd positioning\nof this not-quite-love story with the\nserious business of international rela-tions. he relationship between the\nPresident and the King was far more\ninteresting, and more time should\nhave been spent developing this rela-tionship.\nPart period biopic, part comic, this\nverges from the funny, to dull, to\nthe distinctly queasy. Fantastic sets,\nsoundtrack and costuming capture\nDepression America perfectly; and\ncountless panoramic shots of upstate\nNew York make this a visually pretty\npiece that nonetheless probably has\nmore style than it does substance.\nAlice...all grown\nup now...\n\n"

Everyone on the\ntube seemed to be heading there, and\nI even recognized a few people from\nvarious ATP festivals (including the\ntall grey haired guy who is at literally\neverything). Needless to say, I was as\nhyped up as a little middle class girl\nbuying her \ufb01rst pony.\nhe venue was surprisingly large.\nhe size of it made me worry I have\ncompletely forgotten just how large\nthe Apollo is, being spoilt by a spate\nof gigs in the past 3 months that rarely\nexceeded a 200 person capacity. Accordingly it felt pretty empty when Le\nVolume Courbe opened, and we managed to work our way to the second\nrow. he set seemed pretty great but I\nwas kind of distracted by the upcoming festivities and found it a little hard\nto focus, so I doubt I could really add\nany value by discussing it at length.\nBy the time My Bloody Valentine\ntook the stage, the venue was absolutely rammed. Now I was very concerned\nabout the business of the March\ndates, but was content in that we\nhad held our spot at the front despite\nhow crushed it was elsewhere in the\nvenue. hey opened with a new track\n(the only one they would play), which\nseemed pretty great, although maybe\nI was a bit caught up in seeing them\nagain. he track was, as I somewhat\nexpected, a lot less dense than anything from Loveless, though the drum\nand bass elements Shields referred\nto were, not surprisingly, nowhere in\nsight. he \ufb01rst thing that caught me,\nsadly, was how loud it was \u2013 not very.\nIt was pretty much at a standard gig\nlevel. Certainly nobody was vomiting\non the \ufb02oor whilst bleeding from the\nears, as one would quite like in these\nsituations.\nFrom the o\ufb00, people were complaining about the sound mix. Several people shouted after the \ufb01rst track that the\nvocals were too low, which sounds absurd for shoegaze, but was sadly true.\nOf course they should be buried, but\ncertainly where I was, I literally could\nnot hear them for the vast majority\nof the set. he sound system seemed\ncompletely unable to handle the levels\nthat were desired, with a lack of de\ufb01nition in pretty much everything and\nthe lows getting washed out. he band\nthemselves were clearly very unhappy\nabout the sound too, stopping halfway\nthrough \u2018To Here Knows When\u2019 to try\nand get it turned up, which they certainly managed, but perhaps at the expense of even more \ufb01delity. As Kevin\nShields angrily remarked, \u201cIt sounds\nlike we\u2019re playing in a wind tunnel\nthree miles long\u201d.\nI think it is a testament to the\nstrength of their live set that despite\nbeing clearly a little out of practice and\nhaving all the sound problems, I still\nreally enjoyed the performance. \u2018he\nHolocaust\u2019, it turned out, was indeed\nphenomenal. Again the volume disappointed me, and I think this is possibly\nwhy they chose to cut it short (only 6\nminutes), but the actual noise being\nproduced was pretty incredible. I feel\nit\u2019s quite remarkable really just how\ngood \u2018he Holocaust\u2019 is considering\nthat they have little tendency towards\nnoise overall, and really wish it would\nhave been extended. he drop from\nthe absolutely searing distortion of the\nconclusion of \u2018he Holocaust\u2019 straight\nback into the punchy, catchy drive of\n\u2018You Made Me Realise\u2019 was a de\ufb01nite\nhighlight of the set, and I look forward\nto seeing this executed to its maximum in March. Unless of course they\nare only going to perform 6 minutes\nof it now every time, which would be\ntruly sad.\nI think possibly too onerous of a burden is sometimes put on My Bloody\nValentine as a result of their live repu-tation. Everyone who had seen them\nbefore, and knew how great they can\nbe when the sound is as loud as they\nwant and the system is of a good quali-ty, seemed to be disappointed with the\nset. hose I spoke to who had never\nseen them before thought it was still\namazing despite the problems, and the\ngirl next to us (sadly she disappeared\nbefore I could get an opinion) certainly\nseemed to be enjoying it based on how\nutterly mental she was going. Having\nhad a night to re\ufb02ect, whilst they didn\u2019t\nlive up to the extremely high standard\nI have applied to them, I think they\nwill in March. With two months to really nail their live performances again,\nand the fact that the sound system at\nApollo is far better than at Electric, I\nthink they should once again be able to\nprovide the kind of performance that\nmakes grown men weep.\nDandyWarholssilentlyrockLeTrianon\nOn the 29th of November I was standing in Le Trianon, a music venue in\nParis, waiting for the arrival of he\nDandy Warhols onto the stage.\nWhilst waiting I took a look around\nthe old theatre in which I was stand-ing, and it is truly one of the most\nbeautiful venues that I have ever been\nin, with wooden carvings surrounding\nthe stage and adorning the walls. hen\nthe lights dimmed and they came out\non stage immediately launching into\n\u2018Be-In\u2019 with its slowly building crescendo of pure Dandy Warhols essence setting the tone for the whole\nshow. his wasn\u2019t just a tour to promote their new album, it was a show\nfor the fans.\nhe Dandy Warhols are an American group which have been around\nsince the early 90s, probably being\nbest described under that blanket\nterm \u2018alternative rock\u2019. Whilst remaining in this general genre they\u2019ve managed to change their sound almost\ncontinuously whilst still remaining\nidenti\ufb01ably as the good ol\u2019 Dandy\nWarhols. hey started with garage\nrock, touched on psychedelia, and\nhave had a stint with power-pop during their ongoing evolution, which\nEdward Bals Writer\nW\nseems to be settling, at least for the\nmoment, on a more stripped down,\nguitar driven rock.\nWith this constantly changing\nsound, he Dandy Warhols have\ngenerally polarised fans into groups\nwhich like a particular \u2018version\u2019 of he\nDandy Warhols. It is almost without\ndoubt that the track \u2018Bohemian Like\nYou\u2019, through its use on a Vodafone\nadvert, gained them recognition and\nwas a huge part in their success during this period of the early noughties. I\nthink that it was this song that I heard\n\ufb01rst and their infectious sound has\nmeant that I have been snared since\nthen. I\u2019ve stayed a fan through their\nvarious transformations, as even when\nthey swap to di\ufb00erent genres there\nstill remains something quintessen-tially Dandy Warhols-ish in all their\nalbums, and it\u2019s this that keeps drawing me back.\nAt the concert itself the band pandered to all of their di\ufb00erent fans,\nplaying a large selection of favourites\nfrom across their albums including,\nof course, \u2018Bohemian Like You\u2019 with\nother well-known tracks like \u2018Godless\u2019 and \u2018We Used To Be Friends\u2019 also\nmaking an appearance. A fair few of\nthe songs played were quite di\ufb00erent renditions of their album coun-terparts, even with a melodica being\nbrought out for a few. his added to\ntheir performance making it feel like a\ntruly \u2018live\u2019 and special experience, not\njust a replay of the albums.\nhe band itself was one of the least\ntalkative I\u2019ve seen, possibly was because it was Paris, and instead just got\ndown to playing their no-nonsense\nrock, with the atmosphere building\nthroughout the night, with the old\ntheatre\u2019s dance\ufb02oor literally bouncing by the end. he concert was such\na comprehensive compilation of the\nDandy Warhols, making it a real\npleasure to be part of the experience,\nand convincing me to seek them out\nwhenever they\u2019re on tour.\n\n"

He answered our questions\nand only con\ufb01rmed any notions we\nmay have had about the toughness of\nthe acting profession.\nFelix: Why do you think you were\nselected for this current role?\nSam: his role? I think it\u2019s suitability.\nI\u2019ve got an agent who is my link to the\nprofessional world. She will get casting\nbreakdowns looking for a certain type\nof person and then will run through\nher client list and say, \u201cSam is suitable\nfor this\u201d. Ultimately she gets me in the\ndoor and then I audition. I am very\nlucky with my agent. She\u2019s one of the\nbest in the game so she can get me a\nreally good audition like this one [for\nPrivates on Parade]. hen I go in and\ntry to wow the pants o\ufb00 the director,\nwhich often doesn\u2019t happen.\nWhen I read this part, though, I\nthought this was very much in my\ncomfort zone, so I went into the audition and just said \u2018give me the job\u2019 \u2013\nI didn\u2019t actually say that \u2013 and it just\nwent really well. It was a combination\nof suitability, timing and obviously\nMichael thinking I had the ability to\ndo it.\nF: What\u2019s it like working with Michael?\nS: Working with Michael? (Laughs)\nHe\u2019s really shit... no! When I talk about\nMichael Grandage, I can\u2019t help but\ngush because I think he is fantastic.\nHe\u2019s brilliant like no one I\u2019ve known\nbefore. He assembles a company of\nlike-minded people, who are at the\ntop of their game and who all get on\nwith each other. He talks to everyone\nin the company on a level, so there are\nnever feelings like \u2018he\u2019s the director\u2019\nand we\u2019re \u2018the actors\u2019. He always talks\nacross at you, which is remarkable in\nitself. He also loves what he does so\nmuch. He loves directing. If you\u2019re not\nin a scene and you watch him watching a scene, he is there, living for it. He\nis one of the best directors I\u2019ve ever\nworked with. Hopefully I will work\nwith him again and again.\nF: So how is this di\ufb00erent from other companies you\u2019ve worked with?\nS: his job is the highest calibre job I\u2019ve\nhad so far. When it comes to theatre,\nthis is pretty much as good as it gets: in\nthe West End, Michael Grandage com-pany, Simon Russell [Beale] in the company\u2026 there in rehearsals\u2026 For me as\na young actor it doesn\u2019t really get much\nbetter than that.\nF: Will you be working on other productions for Grandage?\nS: Well that\u2019s down to Michael! I hope\nso. He is very loyal. He says to us in rehearsals that he loves to work with the\nsame people again and again. hat\u2019s\nwhy he\u2019s assembled such a great team.\nHe keeps working with people whom\nhe enjoys working with and has a good\nrelationship. You end up with a great\ncompany full of people who really do\ntheir jobs well.\nF: As an actor, what is your import to\nthe part, how is it being directed and\nhow much do you bring to a role?\nS: I guess he [Grandage] says \u201clet\u2019s try\nsomething\u201d\n. You get up and you have a\ngo. hen he\u2019ll say \u201cthis was good, that\nwasn\u2019t\u201d and he\u2019ll direct you, honing your\nperformance. He is very open minded\nabout what actors as individuals have to\no\ufb00er. He used to be an actor himself. It\u2019s\nalways great to work with directors that\nhave previously been actors because\nthey have way of understanding what\nwe do... because it\u2019s a fucking odd job.\nF: How do you prepare for a role?\nS: It depends. here are some characters that come and you totally get them\n\u2013 totally get where they are coming\nfrom. A lot of it comes down to my ex-periences.\nhere are other times when the characters are much further from you and\nyou have to research and use your imagination to understand those experi-ences. For this [Privates on Parade] for\nexample, it\u2019s 1948, and we\u2019re in the British Armed Services. Immediately there\nare things we can research. Where are\nyou? We\u2019re in Malaya. Okay, what\u2019s\nit like in Malaya? Why are we there?\nYou\u2019re in the army. What\u2019s your rank?\nWhat do you do?\nYou build up a character pro\ufb01le; then\nyou can have fun with it in rehearsals\nand play with voices and funny walks.\nF: Is there a di\ufb00erence to playing a\ncomic part as opposed to playing a\nmore dramatic part?\nS: Not really. You start in the same way.\nYou need the character to be rounded\nand real, but when it comes to performance the only thing that\u2019s di\ufb00erent\nin comedy is that there is a technique,\nwhich separates it from drama. It\u2019s just\nsimple comic timing. If you look at Simon tonight, his comic timing is second to none. hat\u2019s something some\npeople have and some people don\u2019t and\nit\u2019s something you can work towards.\nAnother actor in this company, John\nMarquez, has got an incredible nose\nfor comedy and for sniffing out a gag\nwithout making it unreal. We\u2019d been\nopen for three or four weeks, and there\nwas a line that was bugging him and he\nsuddenly thought \u201cOh I\u2019ve been missing this gag!\u201d\n. He told us in the dressing room and suddenly found a way of\nsaying it with a rhythm. he line gets a\nmassive laugh every night. here is a\ntechnique to comedy that straight drama does not necessarily need.\nF: Is acting a job or a calling?\nS: For me it was de\ufb01nitely a calling.\nSam Swainsbury & Joseph Timms \u00a9Johan Persson\n\n"

    "content": "BOOKS\nBooks Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA Mindstar was Rising\nAlex Savell looks at the early work of Peter F. Hamilton\no those that follow the science \ufb01ction scene Peter\nHamilton will most likely\nbe a name that sets bells\nringing. For me the name\nstand up next to all the other modern\ngiants; Banks, Reynolds, Baxter and\nso on and Hamilton\u2019s Night\u2019s Dawn\nTrilogy will be familiar to many as the\nsort of epic space opera that took the\nsubgenre from something regularly\nworthy of scorn to a legitimate \ufb01eld in\nits own right. But today we look back\nat one of Hamilton\u2019s earlier works, the\nbeginning of a series of three books (he\nis loath to name it a trilogy it seems)\nstarring a hero with a di\ufb00erence; Greg\nMandel.\nIf by some chance you\u2019ve managed to\nmiss Hamilton, or maybe you\u2019ve found\nthe hefty he Reality Dysfunction a little too daunting to take a chance on,\nI suggest you take a look at Mindstar\nRising. Even, perhaps, if you\u2019re not the\nbiggest fan of science \ufb01ction I\u2019d say it\u2019s\nworth a look and is a whole di\ufb00erent\nball game from what you might ex-pect. Written back in the days when\nwe were just beginning to understand\nthat climate change was a big deal the\nbook is set in an arid wasteland of post\nwarming Britain, a world view that\nseemed all too realistic at the time. A\ncountry that\u2019s \ufb01nally crawled free of a\nhard-line government that left the nation in socio-economic tatters, is only\nbeginning to take the necessary steps\nto recover; a world view that seems all\ntoo realistic even now.\nSo the setting isn\u2019t so very unbeliev-able, sure there\u2019s a few jumps in technology in there; arti\ufb01cial intelligence\nfor instance is becoming a thing, but in\ntruth the only really \u2018out there\u2019 concept\nis Greg himself. A retired veteran from\nthe Army\u2019s Elite Mindstar Programme;\nGreg has been turned into a super\nsoldier engineered to possess unique\nabilities. Now, we are really entering\ncomic book territory, Dr Doom seems\nabout to leap out of the shadows, but\nrest assured Mandel won\u2019t be running\naround in red, white and blue lycra\n(unless I missed something really im-portant). Instead Greg has a gland that\nallows him brief periods of telepathic\nsensitivity and some other lesser mental abilities; nothing that makes him\nsigni\ufb01cantly less squishy than your\naverage human being and unlike most\ncomic books the power comes with\na price that\u2019s more than just a small\namount of social awkwardness.\nSo if it\u2019s not that science \ufb01ctional and\nthe protagonist isn\u2019t that much better\nthan everyone else then what\u2019s the ap-peal? Well if you\u2019re asking that question you may be missing the point;\npersonally I love that the plot plays\nout in a world that isn\u2019t so very far removed from our own with a character\nthat\u2019s special without being someone\nthat every geek and nerd wants to be.\nBut if that\u2019s not enough the book is a\ngreat detective novel; Mandel makes\nhis living as a freelance investigator\nand is hired to investigate several incidents of industrial sabotage at Event\nHorizon \u2013 one of the large technology\ncorporations that\u2019s leading the push\nto get the country\u2019s economy back on\ntrack. With his abilities rooting out the\ntraitors and following the evidence to\nthe organisation responsible is something Greg was practically designed\nfor and yet, as with all good detective\nnovels, things are never that simple.\nI remember how gripped I was by\nMindstar Rising; I\u2019d happily say that\ndespite being a real, grown-up novel it\nmaintains itself as an easy read. here\u2019s\nevidence that Hamilton is still honing\nhis craft at this stage; the detail oriented approach present in the Night\u2019s\nDawn Trilogy is not so evident and\nthe plot is more linear than the vast\nscope of other works. But while there\nis a time and a place for plots that span\nthe stars and a host of characters that\nGeorge R. R. Martin would be proud\nof, I still take great joy from occasionally sitting on the shoulder of just one\ngood character and sinking into the\nclose atmosphere that that can create.\nMandel isn\u2019t sitting in a smoky o\ufb03ce in\n1920s Chicago\u2026 but why should history get all the fun.\nPeter F. Hamilton will be at Imperial\nCollege for Picocon 30 on Saturday.\nFebruary 16. As one of the Guests of\nHonour he will give an individual talk\nand participate in the main panel\nwith Steph Swainston, Richard Morgan, Kate Gri\ufb03n and Jaine Fenn.

While occasionally brilliant far more often it\nis painfully frustrating or just plain\ndisappointing. Whatever my personal\nviews on the show, however, I have to\nadmit that, over its extraordinarily\nlong run, it has been both hugely popular and in\ufb02uential, and is therefore\ndeserving of study.\nhis was the reason why I picked\nup Chicks Unravel Time, sequel to\nthe Hugo Award winning Chicks Dig\nTime Lords. A series of essays by over\nthirty female writers, including Diana Gabaldon, Juliet E. McKenna and\nCaroline Symcox, it promised to be an\ninteresting exploration of the show\u2019s\nhistory.\nEach writer focuses primarily on\none season of the show but, apart from\nthat one unifying theme, the essays\nvary wildly in topic \u2013 from looking at\nthe Doctor\u2019s companions, to the personality of the Doctor himself to the\ngeneral philosophy of the show itself.\nEach piece is insightful, well thought\nout and highly researched. Indeed,\nmany of the essays are in fact nothing\nless than fully cited research articles,\nunsurprising given that many of the\nwriters are academics.\nEvery writer is clearly very passionate about the show and, while in many\ncases, this makes for more interesting\narticles it also leads to the book\u2019s main\nproblem. he fact that each writer\nis a massive Doctor Who fan means\nthat their analysis is invariably posi-tive. While some of the worst female\nstereotyping of the old series is, quite\nrightly, pointed out and criticised,\nmany other problems are glossed over.\nhere is no mention of the many\nfailures in pacing, characterisation\nand basic plotting, nor of the frankly\ndisturbing Doctor-Amy-River relationship (where the Doctor completely and repeatedly ruins his companion\u2019s life and then marries her\ndaughter). Admittedly, many of these\nissues are subjective and so you would\nnot expect them to be brought up by\nfans of the show, but I am still greatly\nannoyed by how it repeatedly feels\nthat the book is making excuses for\nthe show.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong; this is still an\nobjectively good book (as much as\nyou can say that about anything), but\ncertainly one aimed primarily for con\ufb01rmed Doctor Who fans. If you don\u2019t\nlike the show the book won\u2019t change\nyour mind and you\u2019ll \ufb01nd the near\nconstant praise tiresome and annoy-ing. Neither is this the book for you if\nyou are looking for an objective analysis of the show\u2019s history. It is, however,\nhighly informative and an interesting\nlook at why so many people love the\nshow.\nJuliet E. McKenna will be at Imperial College for Picocon 30 on the\nweelend of February 16-17 as part of\nthe Write Fantastic collective (also\nincluding Pat Cadigan, Ian Whates,\nKari Sperring, Sarah Ash, Mike\nShevdon and others). She will be participating in the \u2018Overcoming Death\nhrough Science\u2019 panel on Saturday\nand running a series of drop in Writers\u2019 Workshops on the Sunday.

    "content": "NEWS\n4 FRIDAY 01 FEBRUARY\nNews Editors: Aemun\nReza, Nida Mahmud\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLooking into the gender balance\nale undergraduates\ncontinue to outnumber females by\nnearly two to one\nas revealed by the\nCollege Strategic Planning Division.\nFelix tries to make sense of it all.\nhe (unsurprising) revelation came\nto light after the department revealed\nthat for the previous academic year\na mere 3,116 undergraduates out of\n9,080 were female. Some postulate\nthat this is a particular facet of Imperial College but research into other\nUK universities, conducted by Felix, reveals otherwise. he statistics\nhighlight a strong a\ufb03nity of the male\npopulation with STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics)\nsubjects.\nUnited Kingdom Statistics\n\u2018Oxbridge\u2019, Durham University and\nUniversity College London exhibit\nmore balanced male: female ratios,\nwith the latter having a 2% female majority overall. Delving deeper into the\nstatistics shows a pivotal change in\nthe ratio for the STEM subjects. he\nUniversity of Oxford shows that male\nundergraduates outweigh their female\ncounterparts by a sizeable 22%. Building upon this a mere 33.4% of science\nundergraduates at the University of\nCambridge enrolled for equivalent\n2011/2012 academic year were female.\nhe trend for Durham was less polarised but reiterated the correlation.\nTaken with a pinch of salt these \ufb01ndings demonstrate that the phenomenon is far from localised to Imperial\nCollege (being a focus for higher technical education alone), which instead\nre\ufb02ects a more generalised third level\nSTEM trend otherwise obscured in\ndifferent institutions by humanities\ndepartments.\nGlobal Statistics\nFurther investigation conducted by\nFelix presented the observed male: female ratios as a global trend, extending into Europe, the United States of\nAmerica and the Far East. Starting off\nin close proximity to the UK (and closer to my heart \u2013 Eoghan) the skewed\nratio is observed in Dublin institutions.\nOut of the 11,844 undergraduates enrolled at Trinity College Dublin for the\n2010/2011 academic year 4,856 (41%)\nwere male. On the contrary this does\nnot extend to any of the niche STEM\ndisciplines. he starkest contrast to the\ncollege-wide ratio arises within heo-retical Physics; one in thirty scholars\nare said to be female.\nAt Princeton University, an archetype of the widely renowned Ivy\nLeague, data for the 2011/2012 semesters revealed a 51:49 male: female ratio.\nhe Massachusetts Institute of Technology, rather surprisingly, exhibited\na similar overall ratio. In spite of this\na 2008 study co-ordinated by Michael\nMcGrew-Hardeg, executive editor of\nhe Tech, the leading MIT newspaper,\npresented profound deviation within\ncertain STEM disciplines. While a\nstaggering 75% of Brain and Cognitive\nScientists were revealed to be women\nthey only occupied a third of the available spots in Electrical Engineering\nand Computer Science, alleged to be\nthe most competitive course at MIT.\nOne in four Nuclear Science and Engineering undergraduates were female.\nAddressing Asian student trends a\nminimal 2,543 out of 13,887 undergraduates at the University of Tokyo\nwere female as of May 1st 2011. his\nmay re\ufb02ect an extensively developed\nJapanese economy renowned for being\ncentred on the technocrat. he most\npolarised of all Universities is, in fact,\nin Europe. Technische Universiteit\nDelft in Holland once supported a\nwhopping 80:20 male: female majority!\nPossible Reasons for Extreme\nMale:Female Polarisation\nhe data is overwhelming and per-sistent. he Imperial College gender\nratio has remained approximately unchanged over the previously elapsed\ndecade\u2026 but why? he trend extends\nfar beyond third level education and\ndeep into the world of work, despite\nthe efforts of organisations such as\nWISE (Women in Science, Engineering and Construction), who aspire to\nachieve a 30% employment rate in the\naforementioned STEM \ufb01elds by 2020.\nOne might argue that this target is\nsomewhat tame; it even suggests a feeling of hesitancy on the part of WISE.\nhis is di\ufb03cult to rationalise when\none considers the driven work ethic\nof so many women at Imperial College (indeed frequently more driven\nthan many male students). It could be\nconsidered a wider pressing, societal\nproblem that requires urgent address.\nSome argue the phenomenon to\nbe a simultaneously global and cultural legacy from a bygone era, when\nWe all know about the infamous \u2018ratio\u2019 at Imperial. Is it about the\nSTEM subjects, just Imperial, or a worldwide issue? Matt Proctor\nand Eoghan J Totten investigate\nM\npreviously and unfairly subjected.\nIn spite of this many believe that\nsuch bias cannot persevere in the\nmodern world and look towards other\npossibilities. Nature versus nurture has\noften been cited, the trend of discourse\nmoving towards the latter in recent\ntimes. It may be that the signi\ufb01cant\nfemale depletion in STEM university\nsubjects has its origins in early school-ing, education and other childhood\nin\ufb02uences. Boys and girls, rightly or\nwrongly, are frequently encouraged\nin differing manners, with the former\nbeing directed towards scienti\ufb01c dis-ciplines. It may be that this initiates a\nnegative feedback that extends right\nthrough to third level education. he\nproblem may simply be a product of\nnurture. Addressing this fundamental\nsocietal \ufb02aw may begin a process of\nresolution.\nLaura Johnston, WSET Chair, was\nasked for comment. She said that the\n\ufb01gures \u201csuggest it\u2019s a country wide\nproblem and that more efforts should\nbe made to encourage girls to persue\nSTEM subjects at degree level overall.\nOnly then will Imperial start to see a\nproper balance. However, this doesn\u2019t\nexplain the lack of females in more\nadvanced positions within Imperial,\neg.

Sharon\nVan Etten\u2019s third album Tramp was\na piece of the purest beauty which\nhad the critics purring but may have\nfailed to make a nest in the public\nconsciousness. Miss Van Etten\u2019s record is more delicate and fragile than\nanything created by the nymph-like\nLaura Marling and she has just as\nmany connections to Brooklyn cool\nas Karen O, so I \ufb01nd it a travesty\nthat it did not feature more highly on\nalbum of the year lists. I jumped at\nthe opportunity to review her recent\nshow at the Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire,\nand boy, I wasn\u2019t let down!\nhe night started o\ufb00 with two\nnewer songs \u2018All I Can\u2019 and \u2018Warsaw\u2019\nwhich set the tone for a fantastic\nevening. At \ufb01rst glance, the Brooklyn\nbased singer seemed a little intimidated by the surroundings and she\napologised for having a cold, but by\nthe end of the night the packed out\nMark England Music Editor venue was eating from the palm of\nher hands. Having only recently become aware of her, I was not familiar\nwith the older songs but numbers like\n\u2018Save Yourself\u2019 and \u2018Don\u2019t Do It\u2019 were\nvery refreshing and gave her a heavy,\ngrungier live sound. For all the beautiful melodies and swooning guitars,\nmy highlights were her lyrics; Tramp\nis an album based in heartache and\nbreakups and there is no venom\nspared. One cannot help being taken\naback by the overwhelming honesty\nand bitterness of \u2018Serpents\u2019 when the\nlines \u201cYou enjoy sucking on dreams, so\nI will fall asleep, with someone other\nthan you\u201d are uttered. I found myself\nbecoming immersed in her fragile,\nbittersweet world in \u2018Ask\u2019 where Sharon whispers \u201clike cigarette ash, [my\nworld] is collapsing around me\u201d.\nBefore the show, I knew how strong\nVan Etten\u2019s recent releases were, but\nwhat I was not prepared for was how\naccomplished a live performer she has\nbecome. Her beautifully lilting voice\nreminds me of the late Je\ufb00 Buckley\nand there is not much higher praise\nthan that. I left Shepherd\u2019s Bush with\na smile on my face, and I noticed that\nevery other person exiting the venue\nsported exactly the same expression;\nwe had all seen something very spe-cial, and we knew it.\nYeasayersilencetheNaysayers\nMohammad Mirza finds a fat slice of Brooklyn in Shepherds Bush\nfter their successful\nrelease of Fragrant\nWorld, Yeasayer decided to grace the\nShepherd\u2019s Bush Empire with a set list heavy on songs\nfrom their latest album. In the air\nwas a whiff of dope.\nThe crowd roared as the band\ntook to their space station, which\nwas designed to look like a stage.\nKicking off with the well layered\n\u2018Blue Paper\u2019, it took them only a\ncouple of minutes before they had\nturned the night into a dance party.\nThe enthusiastic performance\ngiven by Chris Keating, Anand\nWilder\u2019s bold vocals and Ira Wolf\nTuton\u2019s slippery bass groans, and\nnot to mention the lively drums\nbrought in by Cale Parks really came\ntogether well. They let each other\u2019s\nmusic ease in and it never felt as if\nthey were stretching it. Yeasayer really sounded like four guys playing\nmusic.\nToo cool for clich\u00e9, they distorted\nthe first few notes of their psyche-delicious songs just to leave the\ncrowd guessing. \u20182080\u2019 from their\nfirst album, All Hour Cymbals made\nthe cut with its harmonised chorus\nand their acclaimed single \u2018Longevity\u2019 was a tasty addition with Keating\u2019s breathy squeals and chirps\nadding another layer of life to the\nsong.\nThe ending of \u2018Longevity\u2019 transitioned into an improvised intro to\n\u2018O.N.E.\u2019 which in my opinion was\none of the most entertaining tracks,\nrecreated with bursting tempo\nand manifesting a pretty bold and\nbeautiful performance from Wilder\nwho accentuated the lyrics with his\nstrong vocals. I am such a fan.\nYou could nod your head along to\n\u2018Madder Red\u2019s very catchy yet psychedelic tune which morphed into\n\u2018Demon Road\u2019 after which \u2018Wait\nfor Summer\u2019 flew over and around\nthe crowd lifted by the rich warm\nsynths and exotic guitars. \u2018Ambling\nAmp\u2019 was a delightfully bright and\nuplifting song well placed as the last\nof the main set.\nA four song encore ensued, starting off with the compelling \u2018Fingers\nNever Bleed\u2019 and finishing off with\nthe surprising addition \u2018Folk Hero\nShtick\u2019.\nIt is not very easy to translate such\ndelicate musical arrangements to\nstage but Yeasayer performed admi-rably. One never felt that the pre-re-corded tracks and drum loops were\noverplayed and most of what you\nheard was refreshingly alive and or-ganic. The quartet was exhilarating\nboth visually and sonically. They\nabsolutely killed it.\nA Exhilarating\nboth visually\nand sonically\n\u201d\nually\nually\nically\nically\n\n"

With trig-ger-happy umpires, one would think\nthat the players would take a more\nserious tone to the match, but the\nspirit of mixed hockey won through\nwith the casual disregard of general\nhockey rules and nonchalant attitude.\nhis was a fun match but there was\ncertainly a \ufb01ghting attitude from both\nsides as can only be expected from\nhighly competitive Imperial students!\nhe \ufb01rst half began with both teams\nwell-matched, and plenty of attempts\non goal coming from both sides. After a bit of a tussle, Rooster managed\nto net the \ufb01rst goal of the match for\nIC. his gained a slight momentum\nshift for IC as another one. his time\npressure from IC resulted in a RSM\nown goal by the surprisingly fully\nclothed Matt Webb! his was unlucky\nOn a balmy Wednesday afternoon,\nICURFC travelled to the all weather\npitch at Maidenhead RFC for a double header match against Reading\nUni.\nTop of the league Reading were\nalways going to be a tough physical\nmatch, and playing it on the plastic\ngrass pitch was only going to add to\nthe drama and pace of this crucial\ngame.\nAfter a brief and intense warm up,\nIC kicked off. Captain Jack made the\ninitial hit on the catching Reading\nplayer and drove him into the rubber\ncrumb. Imperial held their ground\nfor a couple of phases, however\nReading looked good on the counter,\nand after an initial break were making good yards.\nAn isolated Imperial munster runner had the ball tackled off him on\nthe halfway line and Reading were\naway. Three quick passes and some\npace on the wing put Imperial 5-0\ndown after five minutes. The conversion was close to the touch-line and the kick was poor so the\nshellshocked Imperial kicked off\nagain, only five points down.\nThis time the defence held firm\nfor around fifteen minutes, with\ngreat work by Tom Chavas, knee\nchopping everything that dared run\nat him. New prop Pierre L\u2019Bour was\nan inspiration in the front row, hauling his weighty frame around the\npark and doing all the donkey work\nasked of him. While relatively inexperienced in the dark art of the front\nrow, he was still confident explaining to the ex-premiership referee\nwhat was happening, much to everyone else\u2019s amusement.\nAt this stage in the game, neither\nteam was making many yards as\nboth defences remained firm; Imperial managed to stem the yards they\nwere previously haemorrhaging until a scrum finally managed to unlock the Imperial back line. After the\ninitial line break, the Reading backs\nflooded through, and touched down\nclose to the posts. Luckily, the second kick was as bad as the first and\nso IC were only 10-0 down.\nReassuring words from Birkett\nin the huddle under the posts to\nstick to our guns, play pattern and\nremain calm were listened to. IC\nsurged forward off the kick off,\nwith many controlled short phases\ntiring the Reading defence before\nsome sublime handling on the left\nwing by O\u2019Connell and Floyd sent\nSyarif darting towards the try line.\nHauled down five meters out, the\nReading defence scrambled to slow\nthe ball down, which meant George\nLane, the boy from up North, had to\ndo some rucking, for which he got\nkicked in the head. After checking\nthat he hadn\u2019t broken his eye socket\nlike his hero, Chris McGeough, a\nquick dab of Vas and he was back in\nthe game. In their desperate attempt\nto avoid conceding a try, the Reading\nflyhalf dove into from the side of the\nruck and threw the ball away. The\nresultant penalty was kicked out on\nthe five metre line. The always dominant lineout went up, and the maul\nwent over the line with ease, L\u2019Bour\ntouching down a well deserved try,\nwhich Cox, on the wide angle, failed\nto convert.\nWith the momentum clearly on\ntheir side, Imperial received the kick\noff for the second half with practiced\nprecision and restarted the pressure\non the Reading defence. However,\nthe advice to \u2018keep calm\u2019 at half\ntime hadn\u2019t been heeded by Floyd,\nwho cynically stopped a Reading\ncounterattack on the left flank with\na deliberate knock on. An immediate yellow card left Imperial a man\ndown in the backs. However this did\nnot deter the forwards who continued to dominate the larger opposition pack with their sheer intensity.\nThe pressure on the Reading defence\nbuilt and built until eventually they\ncracked. With Coxy taking the ball\nto the line and drifting along the\ndefence, Lane cut a hard line back\nand strolled through two poor attempts to tackle before putting the\nball down under the posts. A simple\nconversion for Cox put Imperial in\nthe lead by two points.\nFrom the kick off, Reading camped\nin the Imperial 22 for 15 minutes\nbefore coming away with a penalty\nwhich put them in the lead.\nWith only ten minutes remaining,\nand a point down, Imperial threw\neverything they had at Reading.\nHard yards gained by Hardisty and\nFlanagan, and the always impressive maul, which made 10-25 yards\na time, kept Imperial within striking distance of the Reading line,\nbut to no avail. After a turned over\nball, Reading played out the last two\nminutes with pick and goes and the\ngame ended with them a point up.\nThe entire pack to a man excelled\nthemselves, particularly Olisa Ufodiama who was at the bottom of eve-rything, legally and illegally, like a\ngood 6 should be.\nBy the end of the game, the ground\nwas littered with Reading players,\nwho admitted that Imperial were\n\u2018one of the best drilled and hardest\nrucking teams\u2019 they\u2019d played against.\nDespite the loss, this was one of the\ngutsiest and best performances of\nthe year and if they can string together a few more performances like\nthis one, ICURFC will stay in Prem\nB, and deservedly so.\nIC Rugby 1s Pipped to the post\nFriends and Foe\nFiona Cameron MixedHockeyCaptain\nSports Editor\nOliver Benton\nbut he is now the RSM mixed top goal\nscorer. his led to a 2-0 advantage for\nIC at the end of the \ufb01rst half.\nhen came the opportunity for\nRSM to show that though they were\nlosing the hockey match, their more\nexperienced social life gave them an\nadvantage for the half-time entertain-ment: the boat race. Unfortunately\nIC already started with a disadvantage due to their choice of beverage.\nhough IC valiantly tried their best,\nRSM won the race almost a whole\nperson ahead with \ufb01re in their bellies and having rehydrated the RSM\nstarted the second half with renewed\ncon\ufb01dence.\nUnfortunately despite a valiant effort a dramatic comeback was not on\nthe cards for RSM. Matt Webb put his\nbody on the line to save a goal (this is\nsadly against the rules of hockey) so\na penalty \ufb02ick was awarded against\nthe RSM crushing their hopes of a\ncomeback. he \ufb02ick was successfully\nconverted by Banana Split (Harriet\nStevenson). A win was cemented with\nthe \ufb01nal goal of the match by Flexi\nVadge. herefore the \ufb01nal score was\nfour goals for IC to one boat race win\nto RSM.\n\n"

    "content": "Memoir mash-up\nI am currently looking through Audible.co.uk. his is the Amazon sister-company dedicated to providing audiobooks to the poor souls, such as\nmyself, that have countless hours of\nfree mental time, and a bank card. But,\nwhy do I have all this time? Since starting work at the Centre for Functional\nEcology in Montpellier, France, my life\nhas been dedicated to saving Alpine\nforests from climate change. his has\nmostly involved weighing hundreds of\nplant samples, a sciency way of saying\nleaves. his is a repetitive process that\nleaves my mind free to wonder and I\nam not complaining: I study ecology!\nhe task is long and time consuming,\nbut to be honest, it\u2019s not even the \ufb01rst\ntime I have weighed leaves. I am a pro\nleaf-weigher.\nSo here I am, literally scavenging\nthrough the comedy section of the site,\nlooking for something worth spending\nmy bonus point on (yes, I do have a\nmonthly membership, ok! It\u2019s a bit of\nan addiction at this point). he internship has given me countless compe-tences, some applicable to my CV, and\nothers not so much so. A large knowledge of celebrity memoirs is de\ufb01nitely\none of the latter\u2026 Even so, I am \ufb01nishing all this fun weighing now, so maybe it\u2019s also time to sum up something\nabout what I listened to, loved, hated.\nHere is a short guide to some celebrity\nbiographies that you will have seen on\nchat shows, book columns and tube\nadverts, from someone who has read\n(well, listened to) a great deal of them.\nIf you don\u2019t have all this time at your\ndisposal (and let\u2019s face it, you\u2019re an\nImperialite so you don\u2019t), I hope this\nhelps you take your pick next time you\nbrowse through that bestselling list.\nLet\u2019s start from the number one\nbestseller. Miranda Hart\u2019s funny face\nhas been glooming from every book\npile, every underground tunnel and\nthe Graham Norton show since the\npublication of her Is It Just Me?; a\nbook that asks if she alone is incapable\nof dealing with the daily complications\nof modern life. In truth, the answer is\nyes. Each one of us has embarrassing\nanecdotes to tell at a dinner table, but\nMiranda has lived through all of our\nworse stories, and has some nightmarish ones of her own to tell. Read if you\nenjoy slapstick comedy and are a fan of\nthe lovely comedienne.\nSlightly less recent, but equally,\nthrown at us in every sauce, Stephen\nFry\u2019s he Fry Chronicles narrates the\nsecond chunk of the author\u2019s jam-packed life in his soothing style. A sug-gestion: avoid reading this if you still\ntake rejection from Oxbridge to heart.\nFry describes Cambridge as a mystical\nplace, full of ancient walls of knowledge and masonic jargon, and you will\nonly \ufb01nd it painful. Having said this,\nFry is so charming, that he makes even\njail sound like and appealing place to\nvisit (yes, Stephen Fry has been to jail).\nDavid Mitchell\u2019s autobiography\nBack Story, another of the morning\nshow favourites (not that students\never get to watch morning shows), is a\nwitty journey through London and his\nlife. Starting from Kilburn, the book\ntravels in space rather than time up to\nBBC House (the big one near West\ufb01elds). Satisfyingly, the recollection\nends on a very positive note (spoiler\nalert, if you\u2019ve not turned the TV on in\nthe last couple of years): his relationship with Victoria Coren. I admit I am\na fan of Peep Show and the Mitchell/\nWebb combo, and although I feel no\ncomedian better represents Britain\u2019s\ndarker, slightly wingey side than David Mitchell, it was lovely to see him\nshrivel up with delight while describing his now wife.\nAlthough not technically an autobi-ography, Caitlin Moran\u2019s How To Be\na Woman narrates her life and quest\nto learn how to behave like a proper\nadult female. Whether you are into\nher feminist stance or not (and not-so-big revelation moment, I am), this\nis a truly funny book that will make all\ngirls go \u201cHey I\u2019ve done that!\u201d and most\nof them say \u201chank God someone\nwarned my about that!\u201d (large family\nand hippy parents: Moran\u2019s womanhood has been one of trial and error).\nhe recently published Moranthology\nis also ok, but to avoid if you follow\nMoran\u2019s career on he Times as it is essentially a glossy \ufb01le for all her articles.\nFor the science fans, actually, for the\nlovers of mankind and all things nice,\nDavid Attenborough\u2019s Life on Air is a\nfeast for the brain. It is inspiring in the\nright sort of non-corny way, and incredibly entertaining. From his funny\nanecdotes about rat-infested temples,\nto the description of ground-breaking\n\ufb01lming techniques, Attenborough is\nas good on paper as he is on \ufb01lm. Unsurprisingly majestic.\nhe choice about the ultimate life\nstory to recommend was a hard one.\nDavid Attenborough is biology roy-alty, and although it pains me to write\nthis, I have chosen laughter over roy-alty. For Michael McIntyre\u2019s Life and\nLaughing does exactly what it says on\nthe cover. I know comedy hipsters resent McIntyre for going mainstream,\nbut there is nothing to say: he is as\nsuccessful as he is clever. McIntyre\u2019s\nhilarious childhood is a funnier version of all our family pasts, even with\nhis eccentric Hungarian nan, his\nbombshell mother and his Canadian\nfather, producer of the slightly creepy\nhit song \u2018Grandad\u2019. As the years go by,\nthe comedy becomes serious business and when McIntyre describes his\nbreakthrough gig, and the emotion of\nsharing it with the one-and-only love\nof his life and his two kids, my eyes\ndampened a bit. his is an autobiography that deserves to be listened to:\nhis rendition of \u2018God Save the Queen\u2019,\nduring a recollection of a particularly\nembarrassing family anecdote, made\nmy mother almost crash the car she\nwas driving (my Christmas present to\nher, the book not the car). If you still\ncan\u2019t forgive me for picking Michael\nMcIntyre over David Attenborough,\ndon\u2019t waste any more time and go buy\nLife on Air, in fact, I will be happy to\nlend anyone of you my copy, as I hope\nyou will enjoy all these reads as much\nas I did.\nBOOKS Books Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGiulia Gabrielli Writer\nFRIDAY 01 FEBRUARY\n32\n\n"

LET\u2019S SUE THEM YEAH\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 01 FEBRUARY\n16\nhttp://www.hsmagazine.net\nLove Science?\n(Well your CV says that you are passionate\nabout it and have written for Felix regularly.)\nWhy not make that true? Get in touch!\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFollow us on Facebook, where we\u2019ll post\nup any interesting stuff we stumble upon\n(science-related, obviously).\nhe pill has been letting\nwomen grab life by the\nballs instead of washing\nthose of unwanted children for over 50 years.\nRoughly 100 million women worldwide take the pill and this has led to\nimproved quality of living across the\nglobe, huge reductions in numbers of\ndeaths during childbirth and an understandably massive decrease in the\nnumber of unwanted pregnancies.\nhe pill acts by changing hormone\nlevels to trick the body into thinking\nthat it is already pregnant. his stops\neggs being released from ovaries and\nleads to various gruesome sounding\nthings like increasing your cervical\nmucus. he main aim is to make the\nwomb a pretty inhospitable place for\neggs.\nSo the pill has been having its way\nwith women\u2019s wombs for a long time\nand has played an important part in\nallowing women to have better educations and explore further into the\nworking world. It\u2019s unlikely that many\nfemale CEOs and even Destiny\u2019s\nChild could have been such independent women if it weren\u2019t for contraceptives like the pill.\nHowever, along with these many\nfemale-empowering outcomes of the\npill, there is evidence that the pill may\nbe altering other choices that females\nmake, including their choice of potential suitors and their sexual tendencies.\nNormally, when women are not on\nthe pill, they experience alterations in\ntheir mate preferences through their\nmenstrual cycle. Research has shown\nthat when women are ovulating, and\ntherefore fertile, they show a strong\npreference for more masculine and\ndominant men. Whereas when women are not fertile they shift their preference to more feminine \u2018good father\u2019\ntype men who can look after them\nand provide them with resources, be\nit sandwiches or diamonds. So these\nchanges in women\u2019s instincts lead\nto the exploitation of men for either their potential to shower you with resources or\nto provide their fantastic genes.\nhis cycling has\nbeen put down as\none of the key reasons\nwhy women tend to cheat\nmore on their partners when\novulating. Women also tend to\nact in a more sexually promiscuous\nway when ovulating, so single men of\nImperial, maybe it would be in your\nbene\ufb01t to show some interest in the ladies\u2019 menstrual cycles. However, these\nwomen are generally going to be seriously fertile, so kids... use protection.\nPreference changes also occur in\nmen in response to ovulating women.\nIt has been shown that men are actually more attracted to women when\nthey are ovulating, be it because the\nwomen are acting more con\ufb01dently\nor that men are picking up on some\nkind of pheromone-type signal. So,\nwhat better way to test this idea than\nsend a load of awkward scientists to a\nstrip club? hey basically looked at female stripper wages throughout their\nmenstrual cycles and found that they\nearned on average $150 more when\nthey were ovulating. his pretty ridiculous sounding fact is true; it\u2019s been\nproven using numerous beloved statistical techniques. herefore, I conclude that ovulation makes me (and\nall you other women) $150 sexier. So\nthank you to you ovulation for fuelling\nt h a t questionably sexy dancing in\nMetric for the many\nyears to come.\nAll this normal\ncycling is altered\nwhen women are on\nthe pill. Instead of having a change in mate pref-erence, women on the pill\nare generally stuck in the \u2018good\nfather\u2019 preference. As women\ndon\u2019t actually ovulate when on\nthe pill, the switch in preference to\ndominant, sexy, genetically matched\nmen does not occur or does to a much\nlesser extent.\nhe kinds of relationships that form\nwhen women are on the pill therefore tend to be with \u2018good father\u2019 type\nmales. Questionnaires of these couples\nshowed that they actually tended to be\nhappier in their relationship and therefore they often lasted much longer\nthan couples that met when the woman was not on the pill. However, a huge\nmajority of these couples stated that\nthey were disappointed with their sex\nlives and weren\u2019t really very attracted\nto their partners.\nhere are even further issues. Say,\nthere is a lovely couple that got together when the girl was on the pill. hey\ngo through life ful\ufb01lling numerous dating and romantic clich\u00e9s until \ufb01nally\nhe pops the question. What wonderful\nnews! NO. Following this apparent joyous news the inevitable baby conversations are going to come up, and the decision to come off the pill commences.\nProblem 1: when women come off the\npill they show a strong preference for\nthe masculine, sexy male type. his is\nnot the type of man our scenario husband is. his means that these kinds\nof couples have an increased chance\nof splitting up at this point when the\nwoman comes off the pill. Problem 2:\nIf the couple do stay together, questionnaires have shown that these couples are more dysfunctional, unhappy\nand have unful\ufb01lling sex lives. So your\noptions here are either, never have\nchildren, stay on the pill forever and\ncontinue with your lovely relationship,\nstop taking the pill and break up with\npartner or \ufb01nally stay with your partner and grow into an old bitter couple\nthat probably hate each other.\nheseproblemsaren\u2019teventheendof\nit. As more women are on the pill than\never before, more woman are having\nto face these potential situations, and\nmany are choosing to stay with their\n\u201cgood father\u201d partner and having their\nchildren. hese men are not as well\nmatched genetically as those men they\nwould naturally chose to make babies\nwith and it has been suggested that this\nmay lead to some detrimental health\nimpacts in the future. Basically, those\nmen that are better matched genetically have more genetic dissimilarities,\nparticularly in term of genes involved\nin immunity. herefore, if more women are having children with poor genetically matched men, there are likely\ngoing to be more children with worse\nimmune systems than if women were\npicking men naturally without the pill\u2019s\ninterference. his could mean more allergy prone children and the potential\nincrease in for example, cases of asth-ma. With the future for health looking\nalready increasingly bleak with ever\nincreasing waste lines and pint glasses,\nthe addition of more sickly children is\nnot ideal.\nBut please don\u2019t worry, this is not the\ncase for every woman and these negative health effects aren\u2019t predicted to be\nsevere. Also, if you did meet your partner while on the pill, don\u2019t panic! his\nis not the case for everyone, you may\nbe the lucky exception.\nFacebook facebook.com/Felixscience\n\u201c\n\u201d\nIt\u2019s unlikely that...\neven Destiny\u2019s\nChild could\nhave been such\nindependent\nwomen if it\nweren\u2019t for\ncontraceptives\nlike the pill\nH5N1- coming to a lab near\nyou soon\nMichelle is struggling to remember the last\ntime she took her pill....\n\n"

Standing in a corner are the Russell Group,\nstroking their rugby team\nties and snubbing the rest of the unis,\nwho are actually having fun. Out in the\nhallway are a bunch of businessmen in\na circle, all jacking o\ufb00 onto Imperial,\nwho willingly kneels in the middle.\nhey\u2019re jizzing job o\ufb00ers or something \u2013 don\u2019t read too much into this\nmetaphor, it\u2019s just meant to show a\npoint: Imperial isn\u2019t enjoying the party\nor talking to the other universities at\nall, but is at the centre of its own business bukkake. Imperial is isolated in\na way like no other uni, and this isn\u2019t\nhelping us (in fact, it makes us the\ncreepy guy who\u2019s probably going to go\npostal).\nI should have seen the warning signs\nwhen, during application, I found out\nthat we\u2019re no longer a member of the\nUniversity of London nor are we in the\nNUS. We don\u2019t even get the London\nStudent on campus. All of these lead to\none thing: a university that has no connection to the country\u2019s student body,\nIsolated Imperial\nCatina Willows\nor even to the rest of London.\nPaul Beaumont\u2019s recent comment,\n\u2013 \u201c[the NUS] little re\ufb02ects the needs\nand wants of the \u2018top end\u2019\u201d just seem\nto scream like a little spoilt brat, \u201cbut\nwe\u2019re better than everyone else!\u201d especially when all other unis at the top end\nare in the NUS. Our Union willingly\nand arrogantly puts us in a class above\nevery other university, and like the\nspoilt brat, no one wants to play with\nus. I mean, our varsity game is against\nourselves \u2013 that\u2019s sad, Imperial. Really\nfucking sad.\nhis has some real implications, too:\nsure, our research and graduate employment might be top, but what about the\nstudent experience? here\u2019s so many opportunities we\u2019re missing out on and I\u2019m\nsure this is just one of the many things\ncontributing to our abysmal student satisfaction rating.\nhe Imperial attitude is warped by our\nexclusionism, too. Look at the amount\nof hate the Feminist Society here has\nbeen getting (of which I\u2019m not a member\n\u2013 though this may come as a shock to\ncommenters on my previous article) just\nfor daring to exist. Other universities\nhave had feminist or women\u2019s societies\nfor years. hey\u2019re a normal thing, though\nmost Imperial students would never believe that. I\u2019ve even heard of a feminist\nmagazine \u2013 Cuntry Life \u2013 at Oxford.\nOxford! It\u2019s a really worrying sign when\nwe\u2019re winning at conservatism against\nthe country\u2019s oldest university.\n\u201cImperial apathy\u201d is talked about\na lot, and that\u2019s just another sign of\nthis. No wonder we\u2019re not going to\nprotests or being active in politics if\nwe have no idea what\u2019s going on. So,\nstudents, Paul, Union, please: let\u2019s do\nsomething about this. Voting yes to\njoining the NUS would be a great step,\nbut maybe as a start we could say hello\nto our neighbours on the other side of\nLondon, or they\u2019re gonna forget that\nwe exist.\nS\nAnum Farooq\nerhaps, everybody has\nMurphy in their life. Perhaps, many just do not\nnotice it. Being a sensitive over thinker, I am\nalways a little bit too aware of Murphy and his quirky laws. Basically, the\ntheory goes that anything that can go\nwrong will go wrong.\nMurphy always seemed to be in the\npicture, and I would worry non-stop\nabout what could go wrong, what will\ngo wrong and how to deal with it when\nit does go wrong. A while back, I had\nto be responsible and sensible, strong\nenough to restrain and calm a very ill\nperson, alongside attempting to predict and prevent all the ways that there\nwould be evil in the world as a child.\nYet, trying to be balanced enough to\ncontemplate the arguments with my\nfoster mum, on one important bit\nabout the universe or the other and\nbeing told otherwise.\nI\u2019ll just pause here for a second.\nWhat about you? Just think of everything that has gone wrong in your\nlife. On second thoughts, don\u2019t. hink\nabout everything in your life that has\nbeen a lesson. It\u2019s strange right.\nHow do you feel with a saying from\nan Eastern Sage, who said \u201cWhy do\nOver-analysing - an Imperial tradition\nP\nAnum Farooq takes a positive view of life\nyou complain of the rub, that polishes\nyou, my friend?\u2019 Could it be that Mr\nMurphy is just a theoretical concept is\ninadvertently helping us become better people, in a transient life.\nI don\u2019t know how it happened, or\nthe moment when the weight from\nmy shoulders was lifted and it felt like\nI could see clearly in the mist of real-ity. Occam\u2019s razor (from my limited\nunderstanding) is the concept that in\nessence does not seek a complicated\nexplanation, but gets rid of the un-necessary, and holds true to the most\nstraightforward way of explaining\nthings.\nDon\u2019t you see? Most people push\naway happiness but subconsciously\nhold onto it. What we don\u2019t realize that happiness is here. Happiness\nis past, present and future, towards\na tranquil horizon. A butter\ufb02y that\ncomes and quietly sits by the shoulder,\nwhen we become too large for worry,\ntoo loyal for \ufb01ckleness, too humble\nfor arrogance, too funny for anger,\ntoo sel\ufb02ess for avarice, too brave to\nbe to be in\ufb02uenced and too kind for\njealousy.\nOne day I ran in the \ufb01elds, and sat\non branches that swayed in the wind,\nwith the leaves a kaleidoscope of sunlight and green. I learnt that peace in all\nits de\ufb01nitions is a simple explanation\nfor the inner soul, and the outer world.\nFind your path. Try to simplify life,\n\ufb01nd the simplest explanation and the\nmost positive. It will make a world of\ndi\ufb00erence. You have far more important and beautiful days to be dazed by\nchallenges and miracles.\nDefine what is important, let go\nof the unnecessary. Think for yourself and simplify everything, understand the core. To see the translucent and most positive, to see good\nin all and to believe that yesterday,\ntoday and tomorrow are simply the\nbest days, is a little philosophy that\nleads to nothing going wrong and\neverything going right.\nThis is the only\npicture we could\nfind for \u201cisolation\u201d\n\u201c\u201d\nThe Imperial\nattitude\nis warped\nby our\nexclusionism\nbelieve that\nyesterday,\ntoday and\ntomorrow are\nsimply the\nbest days\n\n"

From the distance the\nEarth lies from the sun, the solar\nrays are strong enough to warm the\natmosphere to around 20-30\u00b0C. he\nsun\u2019s surface is understandably hotter \u2013 with measurements around the\n6000\u00b0C mark. But one question which\nhas had solar physicists ba\ufb04ed is that\nits corona \u2013 the particulate layer above\nthe surface \u2013 has temperatures measuring up to 4,000,000\u00b0C. So where\u2019s all\nthis extra heat coming from?\nOther than the regular conduction\nheating from the photosphere below,\ntheories have been put forward that\nwave heating is a contributor. Jonathan Cirtain, a solar physicist at NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center in\nAlabama explains that sound waves,\ncaused by friction and vibrations\nwithin the sun, travel to the surface\nand deliver energy in the form of heat.\nCalculations using this model lead\nto a coronal temperature estimate of\nonly 1,500,000\u00b0C, so while this theory\nis enough in cooler regions of the co-rona, there is something more happening in the warmer regions which is\nmore than doubling the temperature.\nRecently, Cirtain and colleagues\nhave gathered evidence in support of\nanother theory focusing on the sun\u2019s\nmagnetic \ufb01eld. he team sent out a\nrocket equipped with the High-resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C) into\nspace last July. he resolution of Hi-C\nwas 0.2 arcseconds; enough to pinpoint features on the sun as small as\n150 kilometres (which is comparable\nto spotting a 5 pence piece from 6\nkilometres away).\nhe camera-telescope was set to\nmeasure the extreme parts of the ultraviolet spectrum (with wavelengths\nat 193 \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m) that are usually\nblocked by the Earth\u2019s own atmos-phere, with the aim of observing the\nemission lines of Fe XII atoms (iron\natoms which have had 11 electrons\nin their outer shells ejected). Despite\nventuring out for a total of 5 minutes,\nobserving a mere 3% of the sun\u2019s surface in this time, two distinct episodes\nwere observed where the magnetic\n\ufb01eld strongly interacted to produce Fe\nXII. hese contortions of the magnetic \u2018braids\u2019 would release enough energy to raise temperatures to as high\nas 7,000,000\u00b0C. It is likely that these\ninteractions occur fairly regularly in\nmagnetically-active areas of the sun,\nproviding overall coronal heating,\nbringing temperature estimates closer\nto those measured.\nhe theory that magnetic braids\n(strands of magnetic \ufb01eld) were being\nunravelled and reconnected has been\ntheoretically proposed before, but it\nlacked substantial evidence. Cirtain\nand his team have now observed results that can provide \ufb01rmer backing\nto the theory.\n\u201che new \ufb01ndings are a tantalizing\nglimpse of what is possible with such\nan instrument,\u201d says Peter Cargill, an\nImperial College solar physicist. Even\nwith this limited glance into solar\nmechanisms, the new apparatus developed is still enough to test many\nold hypotheses, and to develop new\nones. he next step will hopefully be\nto develop instruments which can\norbit Earth full time, providing a continual stream of data pertaining to the\nsun and its unusually hot corona.\nDOI:10.1038/nature11772\nThe heat of the sun\u2019s corona has\npuzzled scientists up until now\nFRIDAY 01 FEBRUARY\n18\n?\nDon\u2019t miss the Private Housing\nTalk Tuesday 26 February 2013!\nWin an iPad mini!\nWin a\nWin an\nWin an i\ni\niP\nPad mini!\nPad mini!\nwww.facebook.com/\nimperialstudentaccommodation\nLearn more at:\nwww.imperial.ac.uk/accommodation\nMoving out of halls and thinking about\naccommodation for next year?\nJoin us for:\n\u00bb advice on moving out of halls\n\u00bb tips and advice on when and where\nto start looking for a place to live in the private sector\n\u00bb learning how much you can expect to pay for rent and other costs\n\u00bb advice on your rights as a tenant and how to deal with landlords and\ntheir contracts\n\u00bb tips on moving in/out\n\u00bb exclusive opportunities to meet estate agents, landlords and other\naccommodation service providers\nWhen and where:\n16.30 Exhibition opens in the Queen\u2019s Tower Rooms\n18.00 Talk in the Great Hall\n19.00 Exhibition continues with\na FREE prize draw to win an iPad mini!\nSponsored by\nNick Kennedy Science Writer\n\n"

    "content": "Viva Las \u2013 oooops, scratch\nthat \u2013 Los Angeles!!!\nTRAVEL\n47\nFRIDAY 01 FEBRUARY\nTravel Editors: Simon\nCarnochan, Veronika\nMcQuade\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nI know most of you have connected\nthe above phrase with Las Vegas, but\nI decided it\u2019s high time that we turned\nour attention also to Los Angeles and\nits hidden gems. From the moment\nyou land there, you really feel you are\nin a truly cosmopolitan city, which at\nthe same time features lots of green\nareas, beaches and recreational ac-tivities. It\u2019s di\ufb03cult to comment on\nevery aspect of this city, but I will try\nto draw a general image of what it has\nto o\ufb00er and basically appealed to me.\nOn the one hand you can \ufb01nd the\nrich and glorious neighbourhoods,\nthat accommodate all our favourite\nactors and TV stars, like Beverly Hills\nand Bel Air. Of course it is not necessary to be one of those to appreciate\nthese areas, as everybody can walk\naround these neighbourhoods and\njust admire what is way over his/her\nbudget for sure and dream that maybe\none day he/she can a\ufb00ord something\nsimilar (dream a little dream). But\neven so the architecture of the houses,\nthe parks and the shops are worth a\nvisit.\nOn the other hand there are also\nfamous beaches in the vicinity of the\ncity, just a short bus ride away. To start\nwith there is the Santa Monica Beach,\nwhere one can swim, surf or if afraid\nof the ocean (like me) can just walk by\nthe beach and reach the Venice Beach\non foot. Along the way there are lots\nof small shops to browse and just enjoy the walk. he most famous beach\nof course is without saying Malibu,\nhome to many TV stars as well, and\nhas become more famous due to the\nseries Two and a Half Men. his beach\no\ufb00ers a nice beach to swim but mostly surf. Lastly I want to mention the\nalso well known \u201cLong Beach\u201d, which\ndespite being a rather long bus ride\naway, is worth the travel. he view of\nthe area is magni\ufb01cent especially during sunset and this area also o\ufb00ers a\nwide range of restaurants and coffee shops to just relax and enjoy the\nview. All these beaches are a great way\nto escape the hectic rhythms of the\ncity, but I would advise to avoid going there on a Sunday since it can get\nquite crowded.\nOf course how can I omit the most\nfamous landmark of Los Angeles, Hollywood?! Walk on the famous \u201cWalk\nof Fame\u201d and discover the star of your\nfavourite actor on the pavement and\njust walk around the area to enter the\nmagical world of movies. To conclude\nthe visit, one should de\ufb01nitely visit the\nGri\ufb03th Observatory, from which the\nview of the entire city is breathtaking.\nIt is actually possible to see from there\nhow many di\ufb00erent areas comprise\nthis glorious and huge city.\nObviously Los Angeles has a vast\no\ufb00er of shops all around the city. My\nfavourite places would have to be\nthe Grove Mall, with a wide range of\nshops and restaurants and also close\nby the farmer\u2019s market with food from\nall over the world. It is worth paying a\nvisit to those places!\nMy suggestion overall is to visit\nLos Angeles as it combines perfectly\nthe life of a big city with many recreational possibilities to forget the\nhumdrum of modern life... Also the\ntemperature there is more or less the\nsame throughout the year, so all can\n\ufb01nd some time and a cheap bargain\nto visit it. What are you waiting for?\nStart searching...\nNatalia Petrou Writer\nBeverly Hills\nGrove Mall Venice Beach\nVenice Beach Long Beach View from the\nobservatory\nPhotos taken by Natalia Petrou\n\n"

When she falls ill and is unable\nto perform in her choir\u2019s upcoming competition, it\u2019s down to Arthur\u2019s voice to\ndetermine whether the show goes on or not. Will he sing or won\u2019t be in place\nfor his sick wife? he outcome is a predictable but warmly satisfying one, with\nRedgrave\u2019s well-placed rendition of \u2018True Colours\u2019 bound to leave the audience\nin tears. Plus, how many \ufb01lms this year will have a group of old retirees singing\n\u2018Let\u2019s Talk About Sex\u2019?\nHansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters \u2013 22nd February\nIf Abe Lincoln can be a vampire hunter, these two can certainly be witch hunt-ers. Hansel and Gretel have now grown up, and ever since their unfortunate\nencounter with a witch and her candy house, they have made it their mission\nto slay all witches that terrorise villages and kidnap children. hey meet their\nmatch with Muriel (Famke Janssen) who seems to have a master evil plan to\nkill people. Complete and utter nonsense but perhaps to its intended target\naudience, this could work out to be some refreshing, blood-soaked light en-tertainment.\nCloud Atlas \u2013 22nd February\nAmbitious, visually enthralling, and endlessly entertaining, the Wachowski\nsiblings team up with Tom Tykwer to cover 500 years of narrative, a boatload\nof characters, and fascinating, smart links between six separate plot chunks.\nhis barely made a mark in the US box o\ufb03ce, and is slowly getting its push\nin the European market \u2013 probably won\u2019t do much better on this side of the\nAtlantic either though; which is tragic, because here is a meticulously crafted\n\ufb01lm which o\ufb00ers a wide mix of genres and yet a powerful \ufb01nishing punch.\nMama \u2013 22nd February\nJessica Chastain is on a roll, covering\na every genre possible showing her\nendless versatility. Here we meet her\nin the middle of a spooky horror \ufb01lm.\nAs an unwilling aunt to two trauma-tised nieces, she slowly uncovers the\nmysteries surrounding their dark\npast and a sinister Mama spirit that\nsurrounds them.\nA Good Day to Die Hard \u2013 14th February\nOne for the boys this one, an anti-Valentine\u2019s Day addition to the mix. An\nAmerican cop visits Russia \u2013 a combination not likely to go down well. In the\nprevious instalment we met John McClane\u2019s (Bruce Willis, still going strong\neven though he\u2019s nearing 60 now) daughter. Here we meet his son (Jai Courtney), and the two of them \ufb01ght the bad guys. A lot of dumb fun for sure, with\nabsurd but hilarious one-liners that will make you chuckle.\nTo the Wonder \u2013 22nd\nFebruary\nTerrence Malick is not everyone\u2019s cup\nof tea, as evidenced by the polarised reactions at many of his festival screen-ings. His laboured, slow direction is\nconsidered beautiful to some, but also\ndull and pretentious to others. His\nlatest is no exception to his methods,\nand sports an A-star cast as usual. An\nAmerican man\u2019s (Ben Affleck) marriage to a European woman falls apart,\nwhich prompts him to reach out to an\nold childhood friend of his \u2013 where\nromance ignites. With very little dialogue and a director known to take his\ntime with his lengthy shots, this one is\nde\ufb01nitely not for the easily bored.\nRight Ben...down\non your knees...\nTOWIE\u2019s having\na bad hair day...\nCome here rude boy boy\nboy boy can you get it up...?\nI\u2019ve got a surpriiiiise for youuuuu\nAm I the only\none around here..\nWhat do you mean you haven\u2019t\nfilled out the Felix Sex Survey\n\n"

A faulty plane forces\nhim to emergency land in an open \ufb01eld,\ninstantly turning him into a hero for\nsaving most of his passengers. But an investigation looking into every aspect of\nthe crash draws out his substance abuse\n\u2013 and as an addict who refuses to believe\nhe has a problem, it\u2019s clear he won\u2019t be\nabletocopewellwiththemanyhearings\nand tough questions lined up. he \ufb01rst\nhalf-hour is an intense opening showing\nus the actual crash itself. he rest is an\nin-depth character study of a man who\nspirals out of control, with Washington\ngiving a solid lead performance.\nJohn Park Film Editor\nI Give it a Year \u2013 8th February\nMarriage is hard, as evidenced by a pair of newlyweds facing all sorts of challenges in their \ufb01rst year. Rafe Spall and Rose Byrne are the couple, Minnie\nDriver is the straight-talking hilarious sister of the bride, Anna Faris and Simon Baker star as the potential extra-marital love interests, whereas Stephen\nMerchant and Olivia Coleman lend their comic helping hands as further supporting characters. With a cast this good, it\u2019s worth having some expectation.\nBeautiful Creatures \u2013 13th February\nhe start of a thrilling new witch saga or yet another literary adaptation that fails to soar or even worse, a Twilight-like\ndud? Only time will tell but as far as the casting goes, it doesn\u2019t need any more big names for what appears to be aimed\nat young adults. Based on the popular bestseller of the same name, it deals with a group of witches, sorry, Casters, as a\nyoung girl about to hit 16 (Alice Englert) having to choose between the Light and Dark. Emma hompson and Emmy\nRossum are Dark, Viola Davis and Jeremy Irons are Light. Who will she side with? And the more important question:\nwill the newcomers be competent in their lead roles?\nWarm Bodies \u2013 8th February\nA zombie (Nicholas Hoult) falls in\nlove with a non-zombie human girl\n(Teresa Palmer) after eating her boyfriend\u2019s brain. Aww. It\u2019s certainly an\ninteresting spin on the well-known\nzombie apocalypse setting. Also acting as a tribute to William Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo and Juliet, will these\ntwo star-crossed lovers overcome\ntheir obvious obstacles and di\ufb00erences to live happily ever after? If\nthis decides to follow Shakespeare\u2019s\nwork closely, the answer is probably\nnot.\nThis is 40 \u2013 14th February\nJudd Apatow\u2019s sort-of-sequel to\nKnocked Up, we look at the lives of\nPete (Paul Rudd) and Debbie (Leslie\nMann) as a married couple having to\ncome to terms with ageing and various mid-life crises. hey love each\nother, there\u2019s some falling apart, but\nin the end it turns out they really do\nlove each other. Sounds simple and\npretty standard but with Apatow\nlooking over the project, there are\nplenty of laughs to be had.\nHitchcock \u2013 8th February\nFilming Psycho wasn\u2019t an easy task it seems, as \ufb01nancial problems and sensitive topics prevented even one of the most respected and popular directors in\nHollywood from \ufb01nding much support. Here we focus more heavily on Alfred\nHitchcock\u2019s rocky relationship with his wife Alma Reville, and the two powerhouse British veterans, Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren in their respective\nroles are truly magni\ufb01cent, although the weak and uneven script doesn\u2019t do its\npotentially meaty subject any favours.\nYAAAAAY I\u2019m getting eaten alive today!!!\nStill hotter than\nEdward Cullen\nFlying high\n\u201cI just farted on the last piece\nof pizza before giving it to you\u201d\nDid I lock my front door?\n\n"

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 01 FEBRUARY 27\nIt has been over two years since the\nbeginning of the Arab Spring \u2013 the\nwave of revolutions, protests and\nconflict that swept the Arabian Peninsula \u2013 and things have still not\ndied down. The ongoing civil war\nin Syria, which has left more than\n60,000 dead, along with the continuing protests in Egypt ensure that our\nnewspapers are filled with articles\nabout the Middle East\u2019s struggle for\ndemocracy on a daily basis. Whilst\nthis increased exposure has led to\nheightened interest in the Arab\nworld, it has done nothing to address the way many in the West see\nthe Middle East: a single, monolithic\nentity, an endless desert stretching\nacross from Africa to India, filled\nsolely with oil wells, terrorists and\nguns. The V&A\u2019s exhibition, which\nfeatures work from 30 photographers and artists, helps shine a new\nlight on the Middle East, revealing\nit to be a place of beauty, creativity\nand tenacity.\nA series of photographs taken\nby legendary photographer Abbas\nduring the 1979 Iranian Revolution\nintroduces the first section, which\naims to document life in the Middle\nEast. His black and white images of\nyoung men burning portraits of the\nShah hang next to work by Newsha\nTavakolian showing elderly Iranian\nwomen cradling photos of their\nsons, who died years before in the\nIran-Iraq war, conjuring up an image of the region with which we are\nall familiar: a land of conflict and\nviolence. However, work by other\nartists challenges this view of the\nMiddle East; Tal Shochat\u2019s staged\npictures of impossibly perfect\npomegranate trees highlight the fertility of his native Israel, while Issa\nTouma\u2019s documentation of Sufi pilgrims in northern Syria display the\ncolourful traditions which continue\nto this day. Young Middle Eastern\nartists are documenting the experience of what living is like in the\narea, and what being Middle Eastern\nmeans to them.\nHassan Hajjaj\u2019s portraits open the\nnext section, and playfully explore\nthe culture clash between East and\nWest; women\u2019s eyes peep out from\nbehind Louis Vuitton emblazoned\nheadscarves, and traditional footwear is presented decorated with the\nCoca-Cola logo. Hajjaj is inspired by\nWestern fashion photography, and\nthis reimagining of Western art is\ncontinued by Raeda Saadeh, whose\nportrait Who will make me real\nshows the artist reclining in a pose\nsimilar to the ones found in 19th\nCentury European nudes. Her body\nis covered in a cast made from Palestinian newspapers, which reveal\nher curves but destroy the sensuality normally associated with such\nportraits; Saadeh is immobilised,\nand stares rigidly at the viewer from\ninside her paper-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 prison. Shadi Ghadirian\u2019s photographs show\nteenage girls dressed in the style of\n19th Century Iran\u2019s Oajar period,\nbut he has included an anachronism\nis each portrait which clashes with\nthe traditional veils and skirts many\nof the girls wear; one girl poses\nclutching a Pepsi can, while another\nreaches up to adjust her Ray-Bans.\nThese works explore what it means\nto be young in the Middle East, and\nquestion whether traditional Islamic culture will coexist with Western\nconsumerism.\nThe last section is by far the most\npowerful and, arguably, the most im-portant, as it shows how art can be a\nconduit for social change and rebel-lion. The artists displayed here have\nall made works protesting against\ncurrent regimes in the Middle East.\nAmirali Ghasemi\u2019s work directly\nchallenges the oppression faced by\nyoung people in Iran, as well as the\ncensorship put in place by the gov-ernment. His series Party shows\nphotographs taken at unsanctioned,\nillegal private parties in Tehran, but\nall the exposed skin shown has been\ncut out, replaced by a gaping white\nblankness, creating powerful, unsettling images. This protest against\ncensorship is a theme explored in\nJowhara AlSaud\u2019s line drawings of\nfeatureless, anonymous figures,\nprinted on airmail envelopes. The\nfigures are shown embracing, creating an atmosphere of longing, while\nthe envelopes may refer to attempts\nat communication thwarted by the\nSaudi Arabian government.\nIt is not just the Middle East that is\ncriticised; in her series Most Wanted, Taraneh Hemami took mugshots\nfrom a US governmental website\nshortly following 9/11 and distorted\nthem by scratching the print sur-face. The result is a series of blurred\nfaces. The key features can no longer be distinguished, but broad details such as headscarves can still be\nmade out, referencing both western\nstereotypes of the Middle East, and\nthe heavy-handedness displayed by\nthe American government directly\nfollowing the 9/11 attacks.\nThe exhibition displays a Middle East that is young, vibrant, and\nquickly evolving. As the region becomes more developed, and countries such as Saudi Arabia have an\never-increasing importance in global politics, it is vital that we come\nto recognise the Middle East as a\nveritable hotbed of cultural activity.\nThe changes taking place there are\nfar from over; in fact, they have only\njust begun.\nLight from the Middle East: New Photography at the V&A. Free admission\nFred Fyles Writer\nYouth in revolt\nStreet Anatomy\nFlickr\nRomantically\nApocalyptic\nArtchipel\nThe ubiquitous Flickr cannot escape a mention. The go-to website for professional photographers allows anyone to set up an\naccount and start sharing images. The website takes care to explicitly state the licence applied to each image. Many users make\ntheir work available under creative commons licences for noncommercial uses.\nFlikr may seem like a strange choice. Many of the images are\ncorporate or decidedly amateur. However, when you consider\nthe volume of talented photographers who do use the site,\nyou soon realise how rewarding it can be to simply browse at\nrandom. Definitely not worth a special mention at this point is\nInsatgram, which really does not compare at all. So Instagram,\nconsider yourself snubbed.\nIn the grand scheme of the internet Artchipel is a pretty small\nplayer. However the little French-based tumblr packs a wal-lop. The name is inspired by the concept of the island chain\n(Archepeligo) because if its connotations of connection and\ninterrelation. The art featured ranges pretty widely though\nphotography, collage and painting but as with any gallery it reflect the particular tastes of the curators. In this case the over\nall impression is one of nostalgia and natural aesthetic with a\ndecidedly modern twist.\nWith a growing network of contemporary artists and a regular stream of images and photographs to intrigue the casual\nprocrastinator. As procrastination goes it has to be better than\nFacebook, right?\nIn the spirit of randomness, and because there is quite clearly\nno rhyme or reason to this list. Here is a blog about anatomy\nthemed art... only anatomy art. Why? Because the internet,\nthat\u2019s why.\nThis site is so intriguing in our opinion because it restricts\nits scope to such a small area and yet turns up so many fasci-natingly strange creative ventures. Bakers who cook cakes to\nlook like butchered body parts. Designers who have re-jigged\nthe New York subway into the form of a male member. The\npermutations, from the sublime to the horrific seem endless.\nAs the curators comment, there is more than a little \u201ctouch\nof memento mori\u201d on the site but maybe its healthy to see\nthat beauty can be more than skin deep every now and again.\nWe have had a lot of serious websites and it is time for some light\nrelief. If forced, one would probably classify Romantically Apocalyptic as a web comic. However this is not the place to find a\nweekly series of badly drawn twenty-somethings reenacting old\njokes. RA is a darkly hilarious trip into a demented world, populated solely by monsters, aliens and the insane survivors of the\nholocaust of mankind.\nThe entire series is illustrated with its own idiosyncratic mixture of photography and digital painting. The imagery is so stunning that we feel it deserves a place in this countdown. We recommend you read the comic from the start to have any chance of\nfollowing what we will loosely call a plot.\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n"

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 01 FEBRUARY 25\nPrivates on Parade, a musical farce\nrife with semi-gratuitous nudity and\ncamp song-and-dance numbers, is\nnot the sort of play one would expect\nMichael Grandage to stage. A star-studded Shakespeare production\nwould have been the obvious choice\nas his new company takes to the London stage for the \ufb01rst time. he risk\nthat Grandage has taken is palpable\nin every bawdy, mildly inappropriate\nscene. With a script that is already\nOTT, any directorial excesses could\neasily have had a disastrous e\ufb00ect.\nhe \ufb01ne line that Grandage parades\nhis actors along yields a very strange\nsort of titillation. One cannot help\nbut imagine that the whole thing is\nabout to take a dramatic (although\nsurely hysterical) tumble.\nIt does not. Instead, it triumphs in\na medley of farcical comedy and dramatic sentimentality with a British\nfeel.\nSome of the credit for this success\nhas to go to the unmissable star of the\nshow, Simon Russell Beale.\nBeale gives a fabulous performance\nas the fabulous Acting Captain Terri\nEva Rosenthal Arts Editor\np back into campaign\nmince along to the Michael Grandage Company\u2019s opening show\nF:Howoldwereyouwhenyoudecided?\nS: Nine. I did a jazzed up nativity show\nat my primary school where I was playing Oriole the Angel. I took these three\nkids back in time to show them the true\nmeaning of Christmas. My parents had\nno idea. hey came to watch the show\nand they were knocked over by how\nmuch I\u2019d learned. hey took me to these\ntheatre workshops around the corner\nand that was it.\nIt\u2019s an impossible career sometimes,\nwhen you\u2019re working, like now, it\u2019s the\nbest job ever. When you\u2019re not work-ing, it can send you insane. It\u2019s so competitive and completely subjective and\noften based on nepotism, timing and\nluck. I think you need some sort of calling in order to get through the tough\ntimes.\nF: So is this your big break?\nS: I will only be able to tell that in retrospect from the jobs that come afterwards but it\u2019s de\ufb01nitely the best exposure I\u2019ve had so far..\nF: What do you really aspire to in this\nprofession?\nS: It really changes as you get older.\nWhen I was at drama school in my\nearly 20s, I was just waiting for the limo\nto pick me up to take me to the airport,\nthen a private jet o\ufb00 to Hollywood and\nboom, famous thanks very much! But\nas you get older you realise\u2026\nF: hat the reality of life is somewhat\ndi\ufb00erent\u2026\nS: Yeah, now I am 30 years old and what\nI aim for is to be happy and to reach a\npoint in my career where I can choose\nbetween jobs and have a healthy family\nlife. I think last year was the \ufb01rst time\nI was living o\ufb00 acting and not needing\nto\u2026 I was a male nanny for two years.\nUnemployed actor\u2019s side jobs can be\nvery weird.\nF: What\u2019s the weirdest job you\u2019ve had?\nS: Mine haven\u2019t been too bad. I dressed\nup as Buzz Lightyear for a rich kid\u2019s children\u2019s party. hat was pretty humiliating.\nBut one of my friends went around collecting piss from people. He was doing\nfree sexual health checks, going around\nbars collecting chlamydia tests\u2026 so yeah\nthere is some pretty random stu\ufb00.\nF: Hopefully you won\u2019t have to do\nthat again...\nS: No hopefully not\u2026\nDennis, posted in Malaya for the entertainment of the peace-time con-scripts. Beale as the transvestite Terri\nDennis is the ultimate in campiness.\nHe displays a sense of comic timing\nthat results in subtle moments of absolute hilarity. For one of his num-bers, Beale impersonates Marlene Dietrich. Without a doubt, the general\nimpression of this nicely rotund man\nwith rather disproportionately large\nshoulders in a tight blue dress and\nsuspenders, singing in an exaggerated German accent, is very funny.\nHowever, it is the attention to detail\n\u2013 the little stumble as Terri/ Marlene\nstruggles to get her legs around the\nchair or the grimaces she gives to her\nco-stars when they blunder \u2013 that\ntruly enliven this production. Beale\nalso manages to convey a true sense\nof tragedy.\nAlthough Beale, partially as a result of the loudness of Terri Dennis\u2019\npersona, tends to upstage anyone\nstanding next to him, the rest of the\ncast are excellent in their own right.\nEach character has a real personal-ity, perfectly drawn out by the actors,\nto such an extent that the individual\ncharacters are not farcical in them-selves.\nIt was also amusing to see Sam\nSwainsbury, who we\u2019d interviewed\nonly a couple of hours earlier, now in\npretty short army-issue shorts, totally trans\ufb01gured into a foul-mouthed\nsinging-dancing sensation.\nhe play does try to touch upon\nsome serious topics: amongst them\nare the useless nature of the peacekeeping mission in the colonies, Imperialism in general, the oppression\nof women, the nature of leadership,\ndiscrimination against homosexuals\nand more. In retrospect, this is a bit\nmuch for the essence of the play to\ncarry and perhaps the reason why the\nsecond half fell slightly \ufb02atter than\nthe \ufb01rst. On the other hand, the drama worked well in the \ufb01rst act, providing the same service that \u2018comic\nrelief\u2019 would do in a tragedy.\nhe stage and the colourful costumes \u2013 white satin for Beale \u2013 is\nunderstated and provides the perfect\nbackdrop to the the 1950s musical\nstyle (think South Pacific \u2013 sentimental musical \u2013 with swearing).\nhere are some sensationally funny\nmoments in Privates on Parade and I\nwould suggest one take advantage of\nthe many \u00a310 tickets that this company has to o\ufb00er.\nF: So if you had the choice\u2026 Hamlet\nor Macbeth?\nS: I think it would probably be the Scottish Play [Macbeth] as I think it\u2019s a bit\ngrittier. he thing with Hamlet is that\nit\u2019s amazing but everyone\u2019s got an opinion on it. I think I would just be scared\nof not getting it right.\nF: What would be your ultimate role?\nS: I\u2019ve predominantly done theatre since\nI left [university] but I\u2019m very interested\nin \ufb01lm anyways. At the moment I\u2019ve really got a hankering for exposure on tel-evision. I just \ufb01nd it so exciting. It would\nbe lovely to have one of those contracts\nwith a big American series; like with the\nnew Mad Men or something like that. It\nwould be extraordinary.\nWhen it comes down to it I do like\nplaying the bad guys. I would like to\nplay the trickier characters like Edmund\nin King Lear\u2026 yeah, someone with a\nbit of edge to them, maybe not quite so\nnice.\nF: Can we ask you something a bit\nunfair now just because of the kind of\nnewspaper we are\u2026 at this moment,\nhow would you defend the arts to the\nscientists and engineers that read our\npapers in the battle for funding?\nS: Obviously science is incredibly important but if you work all day, where\ndo you escape to when you \ufb01nish work?\nhey [science and art] are completely\nin balance with each other. I know\nthat when I want to escape I listen to\nmusic\u2026 art is everywhere. I just think\nwe need art, we just need it. We need\nsmiles! If we had a world without laughter or tears it would be a world of robots\nand I think that freedom of expression\nand to enjoy that expression is completely paramount as us as human beings\u2026\nF: And \ufb01nally, you\u2019re in the profession of dressing up\u2026 Have you enjoyed the uniform?\nS: My girlfriend said to me \u2013 there was\na commercial video [for the show] that\nwent up and I\u2019d thought that they were\nrather nice when I \ufb01rst tried them on\u2013\nand then she said \u201ceveryone else looks\nokay but your shorts\u2026 what is the deal\nwith your shorts? hey\u2019re just much\nshorter than everyone else\u2019s\u201d\n.\nhey\u2019renot!It\u2019sjustbecauseIammuch\nlonger than everyone else! hey took a\nbit of getting used to but it\u2019s quite nice,\nwearing uniform. I wear a very fetching\npoliceman\u2019s out\ufb01t late in the play. hat\u2019s\nprobably one of my favourites.\nCompany of SADUSEA \u00a9Johan Persson\n\n"
