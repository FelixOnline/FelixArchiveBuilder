Bennv\nGreen, the incredible standard of some of the\ncompeting bands, Benny Green, U.L. U. Benny Green, and the Inca Civilization; a fair selection of the University^ leading\nbeats, hops and crud s turned up to dance and\nlisten to the Jazz Festival. Much of the music\nwas interesting and entertaining, with a few\nparticular lv competent performances, not abl v from the Chelsea Modern Band, and, though\nopinions differ, the tedious but interesting\nQ.M.

Carnival has two principal aims,\nroughly equal in importance: to have a good\ntime t and to provide money for War on\nWant.\nThe first aim is self-explanatory. We do\nnot live in test-tubes; life is here to be enjoyed and students are perhaps more capable of enjoying it than any other group of\npeople. It must be emphasised, however, that\nthe enjoyment must be shared by everyone who\ncomes into contact with our Carnival. The\nfloat procession is not a summer equivalent\nof Morphy Day. The aim is to attract people\nto the fe tea week later. Flour-bomb throwing or any other form of hooliganism is definitely OUT! This is bound up with the second aim of\nthe Carnival. We are not trying to squeeze\nout what little money remains in students'\npockets. Kensington is a wealthy district and\nwe are trying to put over the idea that the\nImperial College Carnival, and particularly\nthe fe te, is something worth coming to and\nsupporting generously. Last term's carol\nsingers paved the way splendidly.\nWe hope that this will enlighten those who\nstill have the idea that the Carnival, like most\nCollege functions, is simply organised by\nstudents for students.\nWANTED BUTCHER-BASTER\nButcher (amateur), with oven knife i? possible, required for Barbecue in Princes\nGardens at 8 p.m., Thursday of Carnival\nWeek.\nalso\nTEAM OF BASTERS\nrepeat\nB ASTERS between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. same day.\nApply Harold Epton. through Carnival\nOffice or Union Rack.\nFree entry to Barbecue for all Basters\nThis is the last Carnival Page of the term;\nthe next one will appear on the day of the\nMay Ball. Organisers of Carnival events,\nfloats, stalls, etc., are asked to buy this Felix\nfor last minute information, and to leave a note in the Carnival Office if they want any\ninformation to be included. They are also\nasked to have everything ready as far as possible this term; there won't be much time next\nterm.\nOur Carnival will be publicised at a meeting in Kensington Town Hall on May 1st There will also be a street collection. We\nneed volunteers for this job. Please come to\nthe Carnival Office and put your name down.\nThose who went carol singing last term will\nknow how profitable this can be. The Carnival Office on the ground floor of Weeks Hall,\nis open every weekday fun ch time from 12.30\nto 2 p.m. The second day of next term \u2014 Thursday,\nApril 26th \u2014 will be the occasion of a fabulous Glamour Parade at I.C., where the Carnival Queen will be chosen. She will be given\na FREE DOUBLE-TICKET to the May Ball, where\nshe will be crowned. Nominations must be\nhanded in to the Carnival Office by the end\nof this term.\nYou will probably receive a book of raffle\ntickets during the v action.

    "content": "FELIX 9 -The\n40 Pays\nof\n\u2014 Lent \u2014\nThe Forty Days of Lent \u2014 Ash Wednes\nday to Holy Saturday \u2014 are for us Christians a training time. During Lent we follow\nour Lord into the wilderness and with him\nwe pray, we fast and we act so that we can\nbe less unworthy servants of His.\nPlease try to follow these suggestions:\n1. Private prayer to be regular, morning\nand evening. Do not let this slip.\n2. Bible reading daily. The Gospel for the\ncoming Sunday in the New English Bible is\na good scheme.\nTEACHING WEEK\nFeb. 25th \u2014 March 4th,1962, This week was far from usual in Imperial\nCollege and the other colleges in the Kensington area, in that it was 'invaded' by a team of men \u2014 three of them monks \u2014 and\ntwo nuns. The week was called the Teaching\nWeek, and was designed to achieve what in\nfact it did do \u2014 viz. teach the Christian\nFaith.\nThe week started and ended ep prop riat ely enough with worship on the two Sundays.\nBoth at the services of Holy Communion and\nat Evensong the preachers were members of\nthe team.\nOn the Monday and the Friday in the\nlunch hour there were two talks delivered by\nthe Rev. Henry Cooper, on the theme \"The\nHeart of the Matter \u2014 attitudes and trends\nin Church Unity\". There were 20 present at\nthe Monday meeting and about 55 on the\nFriday. Father Cooper was well qu all if i ed to\nspeak on the subject, as he was one of the\ndelegates to Delhi at the recent Third Assembly of the World Council of Churches.\nOn the Tuesday and the Thursday afternoons the General Studies was conducted by\nanother member of the team \u2014 the Rev.\nFather John Shand, S. S. J.E.,a monk of the\nSociety of Saint John the Evangelist. He could\nbe easily recognised by his Cowley Cut,\nwhich resembles that sported by Mike Barron, only much closer!! Father Shand spoke\non the days on the theme \"The relevance of\nthe Christian Gospel Today\", and in it of\nman's attitude to himself, to death, to the\nfact of the Faith etc., etc. The Tuesday\nmeeting had 50 to it and the Thursday one\n60-70. There were daily celebrations of\nHoly Communion in the Concert Hall, with\nthe number attending increasing each day\naveraging 30. The preacher at these celebrations was another member of the team \u2014\nthe Brown Brother, the Rev. Neville Palmer\nof the Society of Saint Francis. He preached\no* \"Prayer\". Breakfast followed after and if\nnothing else resulted from the Week, one thing\ncertainly did \u2014 Mooney had an increase in\ncustom!!\nThe highlights of the Week was the Thursday evening service of Sung Eucharist when\ntwo students were baptised and thirteen confirmed by the Rt. Rev. Thomas Craske, the\nAssistant Bishop of London. Bishop Craske\ncelebrated at the Eucharist and administrated First Communion. There were about\n250 at the service and among those confirmed\nwere two men from Imperial College \u2014 Jim\nIngram and Laurie Aur.tin, whose fiancee,\nHilary was also confirmed jointly with Laurie.\nThe Eucharist was followed by a party held\nin the Snack Bar, where free admission and\nfree beer were the order of the day!!\nThe leader of the Teaching Week team \u2014\nthe Rev. Nicolas Graham conducted the\nmost valuable evening series of three\ninstructions on the FAITH which were\nheld from 8 to 9 p.m. on the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in the Snack Bar. The\nattendance increasing each evening and reaching over 100 on the Wednesday. These\ntalks are to be put into a more permanent\nform for the benefit of those to whom the v meant so much. AH members of the Team\n\u2014 and apart from those mentioned already\nthere were the Rev. John Livingstone, the\nRev. Donald Allchin, the Rev. John Moodv.\nSister Elizabeth of the Society of Saint Francis, and Sister Edna Mary of the Deaconesses\nCommunity \u2014 all of the team were handsomely treated to lunch, tea and supper and\nto innumerable cups of tea and coffee in very\nmany students' rooms in the many hostels\naround. A lot of coffee was drunk, a great\ndeal of talk took place, many friendships made\nand we trust some faith deepened!!\nMany of us count ourselves lucky to\nhave had the great joy and privilege of taking part in this\", Teaching Week of 1962,\nwhich we hope has helped us to deepen our\nlives as members of the FAITH.\n3. Regular attendance at Holy Communion\neach Sunday. The University church for the\nKensington area is Saint Augustine's, Queen's Gate, S.W.7., and services there are 9 a.m Holy Communion and 7.30 p.m. Evensong.\nIt should be the obligation for Christians as\nthe Lord's People to gather round the Lord's Table to partake of the Lord's Body and\nBlood.\n4. Loyalty to the life of the Church in the\nCollege.Apart from the general meetings and\nthe study groups etc., held each week, there\nare five opportunities each week for students\nto receive Holy Communion. You ought to\nmake use of one of them.\na. Tuesday, Weeks Hall, Room 11, 8.30. a.m.b. Tuesday, Huxley Building, Room 1-2.\n12.40 p.m. c. Wednesday, Concert Hall, 8.30 a.m.d. Wednesday, Physics Building, Room 305,\n1 p. m.e. Thursday. Committee Room A,5.45 p.m.5. Some regular form of self-denial. Try\nto do without some item like smoking or a meal on Wednesdays and Fridays. Try to\nlimit time given to some good object like sport\nor seeing your girl friend or boy friend in\norder to practice the salutary habit of self\ncontrol. Of what are you becoming posse sive \u2014 some game or habit? Try to res it some\nparticular temptation in order to give your-selve more fully to serving God.\n6. Almsgiving. The money from your sel t denial ought to be given to some specifically\nChristian cause \u2014 this ought not to be less\nthan five shillings each week. We need priests\nvery badly and the TAP Fund (Tram A Priest)\nis a very worthy Christian cause.\nThis should be extra to. not instead of the\nregular weekly offering each Sunday.\n7. An honest attempt each week to talk\nto some non-churchgoer about our Holy Faith,\nto pray for him or her and to encourage that\nperson to come to church with you.\nIf these suggestions appear to be difficult\nones, they were meant to be so! If you break\nyour resolutions during Lent, do not worry,\njust Start again and go on going on!!\nFATHER IVOR SMITH-CAMERON I Chaplain to Anglican Student*\n\n"

Others (among them\na most venerable professor and ave iy senior\nwarden) showed heroism beyond the call if\nduty by lining the open touch-line in the\nrain. Fortunately they were rewarded by a fine game, full of incident and alive to the\nfinal whistle.\nl'.C. were the first to attack but a kick ahead went over the dead ball line and from\nthe drop-out play surged back down the\nfield. Twice in three minutes. I.C. were pen-ali sed on their own '25' for scrum infringements but the two kicks at goal, from wide\nangles, failed. A break-away by Orman relieved the pressure and a foot-rush lead by\nKehoe resulted in a scrum on the Vets '25'\nFrom the heel Howard put in a well judged\nkick towards the right-hand corner, Rawlings\nfollowed up fast and tackled a defender in\npossession, and Johnson was there to fasten\ncoolly onto the loose ball and score near the\nflag. Fairfield's kick just failed, but after\ntwenty minutes I.C. were leading 3-0 and\nwere now showing a definite superiority.\nThere was little between the sides in the set-scrum s and line-outs but the I.C. forwards\nwere quick to exploit defensive errors, and\nHoward's experience was telling at fly-half\nagainst a three quarter line which made the\ntactical error of lining up almost straight.\n\" MUST HAVE I.C. Both Milwood and Butler broke through in\nmid-field, then from a heel Howard sent the\nthree quarters away to the right. The final\npass went astray but number eight forward\nWillcox came up to dribble over for a try and\nemerge with the delighted smile of one who\nhas found the answer in the soil. Fairfield's kick from near touch went just und tr the\nkick from near touch went just under the\ncross-bar. Vets, counter-attacked fiercely but\nwere held and then driven back by Edward's kicking. Just before half-time it looked as\nif I.C. might score again when Howard ran\nwide sent Butler through on the inside, but\ndesperate defence prevented a try.\nWELL OUT "

C. won the toss\nand I.C. kicked off. Within 5 minutes l.C. took the lead, through a shot from short range\nby centre-forward, Denny Vaughan, then lost\nit when goalkeeper, Jim Ingrams completely\nmissed a seemingly harmless ball from the\nler t wing.\nEquals Record QM C2 Not long after Q.M. C. took the lead when\nBas James completely missed a long ball\ndown the middle* and Q. M.C.'s centre-for-ward made use of a mistake from the edge of\nthe penalty area. Both teams throughout the\nfirst half seemed very nervous of the occasion\nwith a negligible number of passing movements\ntaking place, and the long aimless ball\nseemed to be the order of the day.\nJust before half-tiu.e the l.C. supporters\nwho throughout the game were superior, both\nin numbers and the amount of encouragement given, had something to cheer then up\nwhen the Q.M. C. goalkeeper went up for a high ball, Ibeing hit by Denny Vaughah's shoulder at the same time, who put the ball\nin the net when it was dropped. Despite the\nprotests of Q.M. C. the referee allowed the\ngoal, and I.C. finished the fir at half, very\nfortunate to be level.\nHowever, the second half was a different\nstory, when after 5 minutes Eddie Olding sent\nwhat appeared to be a centre across the goal\nfrom the right. It completely deceived the\nQ.M. C. goalkeeper to finish in the left hand\ncomer of the net. From this time I.C. took\ncomplete control of the game, the defence\ntackling superbly, and attack being built up\nfrom the defence.\n\" RIGHT MAN\"! The 4th goal resulted from a free kick taken\nby Lawrie Austin who squared the ball to\nColin Harris who's thunderbolt shot from the\nedge of the penalty area left the QM. C. goalkeeper helpless. I.C.'s sixth goal was a repeat of this, only from a square pass again\nfrom Austin, who also scored the fifth goal\nwith a high lob from some 30 yards.\nAt full time I.C. were still on the attack,\nand were unfortunate on a couple of occasions not to increase their score, and so ended\none of the best U.L. cup-finals in recent\nyears, and with such a good victory I.C. fittingly equalled the only record in the competition which we do not already hold.\nQ.M. C. FALLBACK CASE MORE ATTACKS AN OLD ING CENTRE The Team was:\nJim Ingram, Steve Fisher, Den Harburn\n(Capt.), Colin Harris, Bas James, Lawrie\nAustin, Peter Longbottom, Eddie Olding,\nDenny Vaughan, John Preece and Colin\nCasemore.\n\n"

The Carnival in the third term has\nalwa vs been difficult ot organise, what with\nexaminations and so forth, and combining it\nwith the second Carnival was a logical thing\nto do. The theme was Roman and togas were\neverywhere in fact there were even a few ladies\nwearing them; in Roman times the only females to wear the togas were prostitutes\nerr rh mm. Eight couples had goi.'e so far as\nto hire full Roman costumes, which added\n\u2022considerably to the atmosphere.\nThe Rugby Club were not i cable by their\na bsc en ce and/or abstinence in the view of\nthe Cup Final the following day and apart\nfrom a few beer y bearded louts at the front,\nthe cabaret su if vive d intact. John Featherstone had managed to avoid the homosexual\ntheme of most Carnival cabarets, and the\nhumour was b awd v and quite good in places.\nPerhaps, the best item was the Roman news\nand weather forecast, read by John Featherstone himself, and the dial o que which followed\nit was good in patches; but it lapsed occasionally into the most horrible puns. The\nsongs were lively but the words were barely\nintelligible even at the front.\nWe had the usual difficulty in getting drinks\nalthough there were two bars and Howard and\nArthur and their assistants worked extremely hard. The buffet comprised chicken risotto and fruit salad and was good, despite the\nfact that Mr. Mooney has been off sick last\nweek or so. Instead of having a series of\nshort cartoons as in previous years a full-length thriller, \"The Fiends\" was shown, together with a Charlie Chaplin and a French\ncartoon. The Lower Lounge was uncomfortably crowded and the main film was in French\nwith sub-tides, (which many people sitting\ndown at the back could not see) so that the\nfilm was not very satisfactory. The bars ran\nout of draught beer just before closing time\nand the dancing went on until five o 'clock,\nleaving five-hundred people in a very delicate\nstate for a considerable time. Congratulations\nand thanks to Messrs. Liddle and Veras and\nall their helpers for a most enjoyable eight\nhours entertainment.\nthe social event of the ses sio i MAY BALL\nFRIDAY, MAY4 TH9.30 P.M. \u2014 DAWN IN THE ENTIRE UNION4 BANDS 4 BARS BUFFET CABARET TICKETS 45/- DOUBLE APPLICATION FORMS FOR TICKETS ARE NOW AVAILABLE IN THE UNION OFFICE.\nBuster Keaton\nand\nthe General\nFriday March 16th,7 p.m., Phys. Lect. Theatre 3.\nIn the 'twenties screen comedy had its hey-day. The leader and most well known was\nof course Chaplin, but Keaton, Lloyd, and\nLangdon were at that time equally famous.\nKeaton was a brilliant clown and original\n(unlike Lloyd and Langdon who followed\nChaplin <somewha|t). His most well known\nfeature was his incredibly immobile face \u2014\na flat white thing. Yet, this face was not expressionless for slight changes were sufficient\nto produce laughter. Keaton came from the\nhard school and did all his own, stunts sometimes with dire results (nearly drowned,\nsquashed, broken leg, broken neck). His two\nmost well known film are 'The Navigator\"\n(1925) and \"The General\" (1927). The latter\nis based on the true exploits of a southern\nAmerican locomotive driver, and in 1956 it\nwas remade straight by Disney as \"The Great\nLocomotive Chase\". The Keaton version is\na tremendous comic \"tour de force' with aconiti nous succession of hilarious scenes. A large portion of the film is devoted to two\nlocomotive chases \u2014 one into and one out\not enemy territory. In between he rescues a girl and obtains enemy information. The\nphotography is good for any year and the\nediting is a masterpiece. Keaton had a hand\nin these for he co-directed the film; this was\nhis usual practice.\nThe coming of sound brought disaster, and\nKeaton never made another successful film.\nHe more recently appeared in \"Sunset Boulevard\" al nd \"Around the World in Eighty\nDays', but never as a star. His humour is\nessentially visual, and with the greater emphasis on sound and speech he disappeared\nfrom sight, but his humour never dial and\ncapable o.f> producing such belly-laughs.\nA. J.

Far be it from me to attempt to dissuade\nhim from his praises, nor. indeed, from his\ncriticisms, but there is one point about which\nI remain puzzled.\nIt is Mr. Gilbert's contention that SCRUTINY\ndisplayed a \"neurotically aggressive\" attitude\nCouncil in its Autumn issue. How then does\nhe square this with the fact that the majority\nof people in this College (judging from the\nfamous Union meeting Idst term) were in\nagreement with SCRUTINY'S main complaint,\ni.e. the disbanding of C.D. N. Does he think\nthey were all neu uro tic as well!\nSurely the idea that SRUTINY is a magazine\nrun by the stirrers and trouble-makers is a little out of date. It was invented by the Establishement at the time of the C. N.D. fiasco\nto convince themselves that they had never\nreally done anything wrong at all. It is a familiar way of ignoring valid criticism. Aftei\nthe Union meeting, when Council were roundly condemned, I supposed that we had seen\nthe las of statements of this kind, but, alas\nf did not count on Mr. Gilbert.\nThe fact that SCRUTINY failed to attack\nCouncil in the last issue was not a fortuitous\naccident or any one of these other ingenious\nexplanations; it was because there was no reason to do so. Just that.\nYours faithfully,\nDONALD PEARSON\nDear Sir,\nThe favourable comments on Scrutiny. by\nMr. Gilbert, in the last week's issue of Felix,\nare timely and most' welcome. However, his\nfurther remarks on the anti-propaganda\npropaganda in the Arab-Israeli dispute are\nmost unfair and untimely. I would like to\nsuggest to him that it would be more appropriate to reserve such comments till after the\nnext issue of Scrutiny when, I hope, I might\nhave the opportunity to refute the charges\nand point out the gross inconsistencies and\n.in a ccpr acids in both MrS Levitt's and Mr.\nSekey's articles in the last1 issue of Scrutiny.\nI need hardly remind MA Gilbert, and\nhe non-commit te ted readers of Felix, of Mr.\nLevitt's letter and the reply to it, both published in the last term's issues of Felix, which\nthe Jewish claim to be God's chosen pe pole who are ordained to return to their promised\nland, was certainly 'cut to size'.\nYours etc.,\nM.H. KUBBA\nAn open letter to the Chairman of the RCS\nEntertainments Committee\nDear Sir,\nWhile in no way wishing to disparage the\nhard work put in by those who were involved\nin the recent R.C.S. Smoking Concert, I do\nfee il that some standard of decency shout d govern the content of such a production.\nA Smoking Concert of 1911 was described\nas \"an excellent musical and dramatic programme . . . including Dr. Philip's quartet\".\nSince then the standard has progressively de-teri orated, reaching what I hoped would be\nan all-time low two years ago. There are depths\nbelow depths however; this year's concert contained all the vulgar \\vor ds in \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" and a few more besides and gave\non the impression of an R.C.S. obsessed with\nsexual perversions and brought up in a school lavatory.\nI am not a prude, but I do not agree that\nhumour is synonymous with filth. Although\nthis year is my last year at I.C.,I should like\nto feel that next year's concert will be one\n\\o which a student can take a reasonably\nbroad minded girl friend and not be ashamed\nto look her in the face afterwards.\nYours sincerely,\nI.N.

Brock.\nInt. 2237.\nDear Mr. Lyle,\nI doubt that anyone with the intention can\nhave enough space in Felix to reply to your\nletter (except perhaps the President).\nYou made certain proposals about publications which are quite revolutionary by I.C. standards. For instance the internal publication of Felix will not only reduce costs\noffer valuable experience in printing procedure to many more students. Already there\nis a FELIX-PHOENIX board which appears to\nme wholly unnecessary. Both papers should\nhave seperate spheres of activity. Possibly a \"humour\" section could be tacked onto Felix\nto obviate the need for a special humour\npaper.\nI will stick out my neck and say that thesis apathy widespread in the Union. A contributory factor is thai few students live in\nhostel and we have therefore no true community spirit. When there is more hostel accommodation we may except the beginning\nof esprit de corps. It would be desirable to\nhave some members of staff (bachelors .pre-sum ably) living in the halls to bring more\nstaff into student activities. As most members of staff now live some distance away,\nit is impracticable to expect them to stay for\nactivities outside lecture hours.\nhig a in I think there is not enough out-ward-looking tendency in the Union. The\nmere mention of bodies or associations outside the College leads to unreasonable outbursts and foolish action as witness the CND\nfiasco.\nIt is time the students at I.C. realised that\nevents outside the College or even outside\nGreat Britain may profoundly affect them in\nspite of themselves. Here in College we have\na glorious opportunity to look at the worlds\nproblems \u2014 politics, economics and so on.\nIt is not enough to have a couple of members\nof Parliament on a debating platform once\na term.\nFinally may I suggest a move to increase\nstudent's interest and knowledge of the Union\nitself. This is that meetings of I.C. Council\nbe open for attendance by all Uion mem mers as spectators. This will necessitate the meetings being held in a large hall like the Conioncert Hall. If you like I would put this as\na formal motion to a General Union Meeting at some future date.\nYours sincerely,\nSAM APEJI\nZoology.\nEL.

    "content": "FELIX NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION FRIDAY,16 TH MARCH19626 dSI SCANS THE SCENE Congratulations to the Hyde Park\nRoad Relay Team, the Soccer Team, the\nSailing Club, the Boat Club \u2014 first VIII', the\nRugby Team and the Jazz Club for their\nrecent victories. A special note of congratulation to the Captains of these teams and\nto the leader of the Jazz Club.\nTwo opposing points of view were expressed in the last issue of Felix. Colcutt,\nwho sets an example which I wish most readers would follow, i.e. doing something for\nthe Union, stated that he wished we would\nfollow the advice of previous presidents. I agree with him on this point and it is because each previous President has left a report stating what he thought should be done\n\u2014 even explaining from which quarters opposition would arise \u2014 that I decided to put\nsome of these ideas into print. However, in\ncontrast to Colcutt's mature and sensible\ncomments, a person in an article 'All Change'\nnot only illustrated that he must be rather\nnarrow-minded and immature but even so dim\nthat he could not grasp the point of my previous article.\nTwo issues ago this column ev pressed a few\nideas concerning what other facilities or activities the Union might be able to offer to the\nstudents. The letters that I have received to\ndate show that most of these suggestions met\nwith interest and, in many cases, approval.\nHowever, the number of letters were only\naround the two dozen mark and were hardly sufficient to start the ball rolling on any\none of these schemes so if you are interested\nor if you completely disapprove, then write and state your point of view.\nFor 'All Change's' benefit let me express\nmy point of view concisely and in another\nway. I believe that more students should take\nan active part in Union affairs and, simultaneously, the people responsible for operating the Union should have closer contact\nwith all the students. It is because of this\nlatter point that the secretary and (myself\nfind it better to operate the Union from the\noffice rather than from )the bar. Not that\nthere is anything wrong with the few who\nare the core of the bar, but it is wrong to\nlimit our contacts by associating only with\none group and the bar core would be the\nfirst to complain if we spent all Our time with\none other group. 'All Change' seems to think\nthat this is minor wrong and that my article\nreferred only to minor wrongs. Does he really\nthink that the fact that Felix, Phoenix and\nScrutiny are losing money is a small wrong\nand that if we bury our heads and ignore this\nthat suddenly these publications will Start\nbreaking even? Apart from publications, my\narticle was concerned with additions, not\nchanges, to the present scheme and it is unfortunate that 'All Change' does not app rie cia te the difference between a change and an\nadded facility or activity.\nIf 'All Cliange' is really distributed. I would\nlike to point out to him and to anyone else\nwho wishes to discuss any matter that I am\nquite approachable the place for discussion\nis the Union Office between 12.30 and 2.30\nApart from the many victories by various\np.m. on Tuesdays to Fridays inclusive.\nImperial College, teams, the Union has been\nrunning a its usual steady pace these last two\nweeks. The Council meeting next Monday\nshould, with any luck, decide some of the\nquestions concerning the Union Publications\nso watch this column for comments in the\nnext issue.\nThis is the last issue of Felix this term\nso best wishes for Easter vacations and try\nto come back in the Carnival Spirit.\nCongratulations again to\nteams and their Captains.\nthe victorious\nPHOTOGRAPH( left to right)\nUNIVERSITY JAZZ GUT TE RIDGE CUP CUL HAM CUP( foreground)\nDIXON BOWL( background)\nU.L.

On the churned up surface it became\nincreasingly difficult to get the ball away\nfrom the scrum s and line-outs and play became a series of foot-rushes and robust exchanges between the forwards, which brought\nmuch advice and encouragement from familiar voices in the stand. Several times Vets\nwere held only on the I.C. goal line and Edward's resolute and steady performance at\nfull-back was admirable. Hereabouts, with\nthe players hardly distinguishable for mud.\nthe field was a\" dark ling plain, full of a la rums of struggle and fight\", and it was a relief to see Kehoe's well-drilled forwards gradually master the challenge and force play\nback to mid-field. Once more I.C. began to\na lack, now chiefly by kicking and fast follow-ing-up. Both Milward and Butler came close-to scoring in individual breaks, and Orman\nand Rawlings on the wings made threat ing runs. With their forwards neutral is ed, Vets\ncould only resort to kicks up field, which always found Edwards in position, and although '(the score remained 6-0, I.C. were VETS BREAKTHROUGH well in control in the fifteen minutes to the\nfinal w his de.
