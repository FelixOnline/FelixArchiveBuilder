    "content": "Felix\nThe Baron of\nCheapskate\nAndy Meritless was a worried man.\nThe citizens had decided they didn't want to count the votes from Bloody\nMary's Medical School. They were\nupset because the Bloody Mary's Chief Citizens had told the lesser\ncitizens which candidates to vote for\nin the citizens' elections. Andy Meritless was upset because he\nthought they were all going to vote\nfor him. Why else had he sold his\nsoul, his grandmother and his fire\nengine to Phil Doodle, the Bloody\nMary's Chief Citizen? Now everybody would have to wait until\nThursday before they knew the\nresult of the elections.\nThe first that most citizens knew\nabout the elections was when the\nplayground next to the 'Quite Tasty'\nBurger Factory was plastered with\nposters, the mediocrity of which\nwas surpassed, with only a few\nexceptions, by the mediocrity of the\ntwelve candidates.\nGrovlin Shittyhouse, possibly the\nmost boring person to have stood\nfor election since Dr David Death,\nmade the big mistake of standing in\nfront of a brick wall which looked\ngood job the Snack Bar is a poster-free zone, or untold members of\ncitizens would have thrown up their\nnut burgers at the sight of them.\nDay two of the campaign, and the\nperfect opportunity for the\ncandidates to show off their verbal\nbanter: A Citizens' meeting. Now that the proposal to do away with\nthe Citizens' meetings had been\nthrown out, this was just like any\nother Citizens' meeting\u2014no one\nknew about it and no one turned\nup. Even the great defender of the\nCitizens' rights, the man (?) who is\nto democracy what Derek Dash is to\nexpansion is m, Phallix Editor\nWillhebe Good for a column inch didn't know until an hour before the\nmeeting. Not surprisingly, therefore, there were no histrionics\nfrom the 'Dirty Dozen', apart from\nGrovlin Shittyhouse, who proposed\nthat the big book of the 500 or so\nslightly less random citizens who\nwere on club committees should be\nsold to people who gave jobs to ex-citizens. The companies that\nGrovlin had in mind were boring\nmoney counters such as Proctor and\nShambles; Snoopers in Y Fronts;\nPeat, Marwick, McRipoff; and\nStock, Aitken, Watermen. It was\nunfortunate for Grovlin that nobody\ncould be bothered to tell him what\na crap idea this was, as he\ndesperately wanted to tell everyone\nhow wonderful he was.\nAfter a day's rest, everyone\ngathered again for the highlight of\nthe week: The Hecklings. This was\nwhen the Dirty Dozen would try\nand tell the citizens how they sat on\nseveral zillion committees, how .they\nconsiderably more interesting than\nhe did. Clare McUseless, a former\nclown and hot-tip for Chief Citizen\nproduced some very nice posters,\nwhich looked as if they'd been done\nby her very good friend, and\ncandidate for Phallix Editor,\nSmuggly. He, meanwhile, looked as\nif he was about to hatch out of his\negg y posters into some sort of green\nsalmonella-infested mess. It's a basically ran the Citizens' Club\nalready, and how much better it\nwould be if they were paid for doing\nso next year. Fortunately, there\nwere a few exceptions to this rule,\nand they will receive a prize far\nmore important than electoral\nsuccess; something that cannot be\nbought by money, favours,\npopularity or notoriety: A mention\nin 'The Duke of Sluicegate'.\nPhallix photographer Doug Queen was running a squeaky-clean\ncampaigning. Clean because he\nprinted his handouts on toilet\npaper, squeaky because one of the\npatches on his jeans was too tight,\nalthough he tried to rectify this by\ngetting well oiled on stage.\nAlistair Goodfornothing stood on\nan amazingly courageous 'I'm not\na hack or on any committees'\nplatform which was novel and refreshing but probably too brutally\nunsubtle, even for Cheapskate.\nFinally, Says Who was too scared to\neven speak, so she sat on the front\nrow whilst her Dracula lookalike\nproposer claimed that she had been\nkidnapped by Daleks, who were\ncoming to exterminate everyone.\nUnfortunately, no one told him that\n'we will exterminate' is not quite so\nfunny when given as a reply to the\n25th consecutive question.\nGro vl in Shittyhouse then\nreminded everyone how like a Thunderbird's puppet he was,\nalthough it must be said that at least\nthey have some character, and far\nbetter dress sense. Another candidate accused of being a puppet\nwas Neil Mc Slime sky, whose\nanswer to Cheapskate's debt crisis\nwas to send a Rag Tit Squad to kill\nHillman Rustbox, the author of the\nMoronic Verses. Now it's funny that\nhe should mention that, for the next\nday's Grauniad suggested that the\nbrass plaque from the 'Friendly hit-squad Embassy round the corner'\nwas not on its way home in\ndiplomatic baggage, but had been\nstolen by the lumps of metal v vor shippers. This was hotly denied\nby their new vice-clown, Keven\nMcCannot, who pointed out that\nthey were busy stealing a lion at the\ntime.\nAnyway, back to the elections,\nand the only one you lot really care\nabout\u2014the one that delivers you this\ntwenty pages of toilet paper every\nFriday \u2014 The Phalli x Editor.\nStanding for this were Smuggly, the\nfairy-story writer, and Winthrop\nCravat, the in-depth fairy-story\nwriter\u2014and Winthrop certainly\nknew an in-depth fairy when he saw\none. The Hecklings for this post\nwere particularly boring, apart from\nwhen Smugglv (proposed by Julian\nLess, chair of Cheapskate Citizens\nagainst Water Polo Society) forgot\nabout the wonders that 1992 and the\nsingle European market will bring,\nlike rabies.\nOn Monday all twelve candidates\nthought that their problems were\nalmost over, and that they would\nsoon learn the deliberations of\nCitizens of Cheapskate.Now they,\nand everyone else, would have to\nwait another two agonising days.\nI bet you expected some silly\nquestions here \u2014 Ed.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publication Board and is printed by the Imperial College Union Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London, SW7\n2BB( Tel 01-589 5111 ext 3515).

    "content": "2 R OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\n'Vote rigging' at St\nMary's delays count\n. A meeting of the Imperial College\nUnion Executive ( ICU Exec)\nyesterday decided to postpone vote\ncounting in the Imperial College\nUnion Elections following allegations that the St Mary's Union\nExecutive attempted to unfairly\nin flu enc s the result of the election.\nThe allegations will be brought\nbefore the Union General Meeting\n(UGM) at IC on Thursday when\nstudents will be asked to decide\nwhether the votes cast by St Mary's should be disallowed.\nThe move follows the discovery of\na poster at St Mary's labelled with\nthe official Union emblem - asking\nstudents to vote for Andrew Meredith for President, Dave\nWilliams for Honorary Secretary\nand Dave Smedley for FELIX Editor.\n(Mr Williams is actually standing for\nDeputy President).\nSt Mary's Union Secretary,\nGraham Price, who admitted he had\nput up the poster told FELIX that he\nwas acting as an individual and not\non behalf of St Mary's Union. This\nis disputed by six St Mary's students\ncontacted separate-ly by FELIX\nyesterday who claimed that they\nhad been advised how to vote at a Union meeting.\nThe student responsible for\nmanning the ballot box at SM HMS on Monday told FELIX that a number of students had taken their\nballot papers way in order to\nascertain \"the manner in which they\nwere supposed to vote\" and returned them subsequently.\nThe poster was reported to the\nICU Elections Committee last\nMonday by Robin Davison who is\nstanding for the post of FELIX\nEditor. The Committee found the St\nMary's Exec to have 'acted\nirresponsibly and in a manner likely\nto prejudice the outcome of the\nelection' and subsequently decided\nto discount the votes from St\nMary's. The decision was challenged by\nAndrew Meredith, a candidate for\nPresident proposed by SM HMS U President, Phil Drew. Although the\ndecision was upheld by a meeting\nof the IC Union Executive, Mr Meredith decided to exercise his\nright to bring the matter before aUG M. Speaking from St Mary's he\ncommented 'It's a complete travesty\nof democracy. I do not feel the\nposter affected the voting.'\nGraham Price told FELIX that he\nhad not been informed of the rules\nof the voting procedure.He added\nthat as St Mary's is not as yet a Constituent College of Imperial it is\nnot answerable to IC election\nrules.In response, Ian Morris told\nFELIX that by 'similar argument' IC\nwere within their rights to discount\nthe St Mary's votes.Phil Drew said\nthat he was unhappy that St Mary's Union were not consulted before the\nIC Exec decision and said that it\nwould have serious effects on the\nmerger negotiations.\nIC Returning Officer, Ian Morris,\ntold Felix that he felt the poster was\n'the provable tip of the iceberg.' He\nadded that he felt confident that\nThursday's Union General Meeting\nwould uphold the IC Exec decision.\nLegionnaires out\nbreak at IC\nA case of Legionnaires disease in\nCollege was confirmed on Friday by\nthe College Secretary, John Smith.\nWater based cooling towers\nthroughout the College and the\nScience Museum have been shut\ndown since the weekend as a precaution.\nA telecom uni cations engineer on\nthe College staff was admitted to St\nMary's Hospital two weeks ago, but\nthe disease was not confirmed until\nlast Friday. A security guard from\nthe Science Museum was admitted\non the same day and is exhibiting\nsymptoms of the disease. He has\nbeen in isolation since February\n17th. In the statement confirming the\nthe outbreak, Mr Smith stressed that\nno evidence has been yet found of\nthe presence of the bacteria within\nCollege. He also stated that 'person-to-person infection is unknown'.\nAll recent outbreaks of the disease\nhave been associated with ventilation cooling towers similar to\nthose used by College.\nThe incubation period for the\nillness is 2-10 days and the College\nHealth Service Director has advised\nall students and staff suffering any\nof the symptoms, which include\nchest pains on breathing, high fever\nor nausea, to take them seriously.\n0 Editorial\nThe Union were right in their\ndecision to disallow the votes from\nSt Mary's. The Medical School\nUnion acted unfairly and b latent ly whey they tried to get persuade the\nvoters at St Mary's to vote for their\nadopted candidates.\nThe explanation prof erred by the\nUnion Secretary, that he was acting\nas an individual when he put up a notice indicating the way St Mary's should vote, just does not wash\nwhen the notice was written on\nOfficial Union notepaper.\nNor can the claims by students\nfrom St Mary's that they were\nadvised how to vote be brushed\naside.\nThe irony of the situation is that\nmany of the Students at St Marys\nare not particular y interested in\nImperial or its elections.\nNevertheless, given the large\nnumber of candidates this year,\neven a few votes from St Mary's could make the difference between\nsuccess or failure.\nNo doubt Mr Merredith who was\ndepending so heavily St Mary's for\nhis votes will be trying to rally the\nmedics to attend the UGM on\nThursday.\nSt Mary's will no doubt argue\nthat it is a breach of democracy to\ntake away their right to vote.\nBut the UGM should not forget\nthat it is a far greater breach of\ndemocracy to cheat in an election.\nIf ICU has the decency to allow\nSt Mary's the pri vili ge of voting in\nour elections, the least we can\nexpect them to do is to play it by the\nrules.\nCredits. Whoever thought of\nbringing out a flysheet deserves\nshooting. Many thanks to the\nvaliant staff who have stayed up all\nnight; Rob, Liz, Sez, Andy and\nRupert, and to all the people who\nworked on FELIX today. I love you\nall and 1 want to have your babies\nISSUE 831 10 MAR1989\n\n"
