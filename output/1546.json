    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n23\nFRIDAY 10 MAY\nYippee-ki-yay, North Korea!\nJohn Park Film Editor\nOlympus Has Fallen\nDirector: Antoine Fuqua\nScreenwriters: Creighton\nRothenberger, Katrin Benedikt\nStarring: Gerard Butler, Aaron\nEckhart, Morgan Freeman, Melissa\nLeo, Angela Bassett, Rick Yune\nWith tensions in North Korea constantly on the rise, Gerard Butler\u2019s\nnew action-packed outing tells a\nstory that doesn\u2019t seem far too out of\nreach.\nEven in this \ufb01ctional world where\nButler is an ex-Secret Service agent\nnow demoted to work in the Treasury\nDepartment, North Korea is causing\nproblems for the free world with their\nendless nuclear missile tests. Naturally, a meeting between the United\nStates and its ally South Korea takes\nplace in the White House, only for\nthis highly-secured engagement to\nbe hijacked by a guerrilla attack led\nby the North Koreans.\nWell-armed bad guys dressed as\ntourists take over the White House\nin a laughable instant, and it\u2019s as\nthough the trained men who are supposed to be guarding those highest in\nthe government forgot to come into\nwork prepared that day. Whatever\nthe reason, everyone falls like leaves,\nin a pretty hilarious sequence that\nshows the audience, in slow-motion\nand backed by corny music, the gunning down of agent after agent who\nare helpless against the perfectly prepared villains. There\u2019s even a dog that\nputs up a \ufb01ght. Subtlety isn\u2019t exactly\nthe \ufb01lm\u2019s strong suit, nor should it be.\nTrapped in an impenetrable underground bunker with the terrorists is\nthe President (Eckhart), Secretary of\nDefense (Leo), amongst others who\nare played by less well-known faces,\nwhich means they matter much less.\nNot even the position of Vice President is worthy of having a relatively\nfamous name play him. (Poor Joe\nBiden \u2013 this goes to show the public\u2019s\ngeneral perception of that particular\nposition.) They\u2019re pushed around and\nkicked about, as they hold important\nsecrets that prove vital to the North\nKoreans\u2019 endgame. But enough about\nthem, where on earth is Butler \ufb02exing\nhis hero muscles?\nAnd so it\u2019s the perfect time for retired agent Mike Banning (Butler) to\njump back into action, and take on\nthese guys all by himself. It seems\nlike an unfair \ufb01ght, but not to worry;\nBanning was one of the best agents\nLynne Jacobs (Bassett), the head of\nSecret Services, had ever seen, which\nmeans he can take on a number of\nbad guys, even after 18 months of\nbeing out of the \ufb01eld, have all sorts\nof injuries in\ufb02icted on him, and yet\nwalk away \ufb01ne from all the bloody\nmess. That\u2019s what \u201cbest\u201d means \u2013 i.e.\nsuperhuman.\nSpeaker of the House Allan Trumbull (Freeman) is now the Acting\nPresident and, in turn, forms himself\na little emergency committee, which\nis essentially full of self-important,\narrogant idiots who can\u2019t do a single\nuseful thing in their stu\ufb00y meeting\nroom. In dire times such as this one,\nBanning has no trouble speaking\nfreely, calling them out on their silly\nerrors, and generating some laughs\nfor the audience for his sheer audac-ity.\nPlaying a man de\ufb01ned by his brute\nforce and very little humanity, Butler\nabsolutely nails the role Bruce Willis\nplayed more than a couple of decades\nago. He has no trouble looking convincing as he beats someone to a pulp,\nhe is disturbingly calm as he tortures\nsomeone for information, and he has\nno trouble \ufb01ring o\ufb00 sly one-liners at\nthe bad guys. This role seems to have\nbeen tailored for Butler, and he seems\nto be comfortably in his place, doing\nwhat he does best.\nOther roles are very limited, as the\n\ufb01lm has barely enough time to develop its central character. All those\ntaken hostage put on an admiring\nlevel of bravery and patriotism, most\nmemorable being Leo\u2019s Secretary of\nDefense Ruth McMillan, who doesn\u2019t\nutter a single useful word for the terrorists even after she\u2019s punched and\nkicked in ways no elderly woman\nshould ever be treated.\nYune has played a vicious North\nKorean before in yet another highpro\ufb01le \ufb01lm, Die Another Day, and he\nsmoothly pulls o\ufb00 yet another one\nof those as he makes crazy demands\nand stares glaringly into the camera.\nUnder the assured hands of Fuqua,\nthe man who gave us Training Day,\nTears of the Sun, among others, he\nisn\u2019t one to shy away from brutal-ity. There is a lot of fun to be had as\nthe unrestrained pitbull of Banning\nploughs his way through, saving the\nday, although his mission is slightly\nderailed by having to focus on saving\nthe President\u2019s young son, the \ufb01lm\u2019s\nweak point in selling the action.\nIt\u2019s all incredibly silly, and this\nmakes one hope that the actual\nWhite House does have better security than what is demonstrated here.\nOtherwise, if North Korea gets their\nhands on a copy of this \ufb01lm, we could\nall be done for. And the shamelessly\npatriotic message (any lingering shot\nof the American \ufb02ag is an example)\nmay even have you unknowingly side\nwith the invaders. But all in all, it\u2019s a\ndumb, fun, easy watch.\n\n"

The last term and the\nlast stretch of College until\nexams are over (hopefully you\nwon\u2019t be returning in summer for resits). You can almost sense\nthe high tension and stress in the air.\nIt\u2019s a familiar feeling and reminds you\nthat the culmination of months (and\nin some people\u2019s case years) of work\nis just around the corner. Much like\nPhil Collins once said, you can feel it\ncoming in the air tonight \u2013 which, inci-dentally, I\u2019ve only just realised actually\nsounds pretty rude when you think\nabout it.\nSo, standard advice about not\nstressing too much and blah blah\nblah. It really does apply though. It\u2019s\nbetter to actually do three hours of\nfocussed work and then an hour of\nchilling out as opposed to five hours\nof not really concentrating. If you\u2019re\nnot a final year then spare a thought\nfor them. In your fourth year you may\nhave had seven and over years of exams in summer. By then you definitely\nget exam fatigue, and really have to\nmotivate yourself to remember that\nit\u2019s just one last push. Unless you do\na law conversion course, or are going into a job where you have to do\ntraining and pass exams. Sorry, that\u2019s\nprobably not helping the whole \u201cone\nlast time\u201d approach very much.\nDuring the next few weeks you may\nstart to think that exams and work are\nthe only thing there is to life. At a place\nlike Imperial it\u2019s really easy to get into\nthe mindset that it is the most important aspect of your existence. All of\nthe work and your grades do matter\na lot, but remember that there is light\nat the end of the tunnel. Just keep a\npositive mental image of what it\u2019ll be\nlike when you finish. It can be any-thing: sunbathing on a beach/watch-ing endless TV/reading a good book/\nin Belushi\u2019s calling the toilet attendant\n\u201cmate\u201d and inexplicably giving him \u00a32\ncoins for no reason \u2013 as long as it\u2019s\nsomething that makes you smile it\u2019s\nwhat you should remember you will\nbe able to do in a few month\u2019s time. If\nthat still doesn\u2019t help then remember\nthis: it is just an exam. Nobody will\ndie if you fail it (erm, except maybe\nfor medics? But, you will have loads\nof on the job training I\u2019m sure/hope).\nEven if you do, there\u2019s always a way\nout. Retakes, resitting a year, going\nto a different university to start fresh,\nthere\u2019s a range of options. So, parting\nwords from the strange Agony Uncle\npersona I appear to have adopted:\nwork hard for this short period of time,\nand it\u2019ll all be over soon. Then you can\nforget differential equations exist.\nHalls\nCollege and the Union ping ponged\nresponses to each other. This is a step\nforward. Now there is a much more\nopen dialogue. Before it was all things\nthat nobody was able to tell anyone\nabout. The fact that the Management\nBoard have responded to students is\ndefinitely moving in the right direc-tion. However, we must be careful.\nThe words must turn into actions and\nfirm guarentees. Also, we must make\nsure we don\u2019t all just get bored, forget\nabout it, and let things quietly slip by\nwithout the student voice being heard.\nGarden Hall and Evelyn Gardens\nare still under threat, as is Pembridge.\nThey really are a great asset and make\nbeing a fresher at Imperial an amazing\nyear. In terms of student experience\n(the latest catchphrase that basically\nmeans how good your time is here)\nhaving such great, cheap, close accommodation was a real boost. We\nmust hope that there will be some\ngood news on this front at some point,\nand also continue to lobby for their\nsurvival. They are really worth it for\nImperial. In terms of Acton, there must\nnow be a positive dialogue. We have to\nsee what we can do to make it the best\nit can be, if it must be. It\u2019s definitely\ngood that there is a working group and\nstudents are involved.\nMARQUEE WATCH PART 2\nQueen\u2019s Lawn hasn\u2019t got a marquee, but\nit does have a bouncy castle...\nI\n\n"

    "content": "MUSIC\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\n21\nFRIDAY 10 MAY\nTheinternetpresents:MSMR\nithin the past\nyear experimental electronic\nmusic has exploded into the\nD.I.Y. cassette culture within the UK,\npreviously dominated by (but by no\nmeans limited to) noise releases. Stephen Bishop, head honcho of prominent label Opal Tapes, spoke to me\nabout its formation, the themes that\nrun through its work and his opinions\non noise in electronic music.\nRoss Gray: How did Opal Tapes\ncome about? There seems to have\nbeen quite a resurgence in cassette-based labels recently; did this inspire you?\nStephen Bishop: I started Opal Tapes\nlast July after considering starting a label for a while. It came to be at a time\nwhen I really needed something to focus on and I just wanted to get busy\nand release some music and have a\nchat with some folks. I simply contacted some artists whose work I enjoyed\nand asked if they were interested in\ndoing a tape release. Things have just\nrolled on since then, same principle,\nand thankfully people have been really\nreceptive to it.\nI buy a lot of music on tape and love\nlabels like Phaserprone, Ekhein, Belaten, always dug how even with disparity in the styles of music they\u2019d cover\nthere was always a strong aesthetic\ncore to all the releases, something\nwhich could be felt. Older noise labels\nlike Banned Productions, G.R.O.S.S.\nand Broken Flag could have the same\nCassetteCulture:OpalTapesInterview\nRoss Gray discussestheelectroniccassettelabelwithStephen Bishop\nsaid for them. Quietly characterful in\ntheir own way. I\u2019ve been around tapes\nin music for as long as I can remember\nreally, whether as media or as source\nmaterial for musicians. Opal Tapes\nis inspired by all of this of course but\nthe use of tape is not some bijou state-ment. It\u2019s a worthy format and one\nwhich has been used continually since\nits development all around the world.\nPeople seem to forget that when they\napproach this topic sometimes. At its\norigin Opal is inspired by sound alone.\nRG: In the releases you\u2019ve put out\nso far, Opal Tapes has demonstrated remarkable eclecticism, from\ndanceable techno to almost all out\nnoise, and yet as with the labels you\nmentioned, there\u2019s something that\nseems to hold it all together. Do you\nthink that\u2019s the case?\nSB: It\u2019s interesting to hear people say\nthat and I\u2019d like to know what you\nthink that it is? I\u2019m in the middle of\nthe sounds so see it di\ufb00erently. I think\none unifying theme\nto the catalogue is\nan altered approach.\nMost of the releases\ncan be heard with\nreference to house\nor techno styles but\ntend to bring about\na \ufb01nal piece which\nis often unsuitable\nfor the context that\nis ascribed to it. For\nexample the Huerco\nS. bits which have all\nthe composite parts\nof a classic Chicago\nhouse track but are\nrecomposed into a\ndi\ufb00erent environment and time/head\nspace. The groove\nis still present but\nthe literal ecstasy is\nnascent, transpar-ent. I feel his music\nis incredibly sad. I\ndo lean toward listening to electronics\nwhich have a rougher edge to them,\nlike to hear pieces with a loose and\nplayed quality. Perhaps these tendencies are recognisable? I don\u2019t really\nknow man [laughs].\nSo this idea of a reusing of genre\ntemplates and a density and claustrophobia brought to it by adopting lo-\ufb01\ntechniques. That\u2019s a good line that can\nbe drawn through Opal Tapes.\nRG: I think for me it is a lot of things\nyou mentioned; there seems to be\nthis grittiness to all the record-ings, and a running theme of ex-perimentalism. I also feel like the\nW\nmore dance\ufb02oor based productions\n(if they could be called that) have a\ntendency to bring in noisy elements.\nIt seems that there\u2019s been more of a\npush in general towards these kind\nof noise / techno crossovers recently (e.g. Container) \u2013 do you think\nthe use of noise is becoming more\nprevalent in electronic music?\nSB: Noise and music is a strange thing.\nNoise is essentially a lack of information or an obscuring of it. Music is in-formation. Whether the two are symbiotic with \u201cnoise-techno\u201d etc I don\u2019t\nknow. To me it\u2019s not noise, it\u2019s texture.\nIt\u2019s musical information which is as\nvalid as a chord. If it were possible\nto observe the \ufb02ux of textural choice\nin electronic music then we may see\na rhythm forming where it \ufb01nds validity and then falls back out. Listen\nto Xenakis early work and the use\nof \u201cnoise\u201d or more realistically non-traditional sound deployment is ever\npresent. Same with much of the early\nelectronic works of Europe and America. As such noise is not something\nnew but something which becomes\nre-appropriated as music continues\nits cycle.\nWith an artist like Container, I don\u2019t\nperceive his use of \u201cnoise\u201d as statement or anything so bold. To me it\u2019s\njust about urgency and latent energy.\nThe potential of the machine poking\nthrough into the arrangement.\nRG: On the subject of running\nthemes through\nthe Opal cata-logue, could you\ntell us a little\nabout the Mirror\n& Gate series?\nSeems like the\nplace where the\nvariety is demonstrated most\nmarkedly.\nSB: Mirror & Gate\nis a series of releases which is put\ntogether by myself\nand Matthew Kent\nof Blowing Up The\nWorkshop. We\nboth share similar\nears (though Matt\u2019s\nwork a little better\nthan mine these\ndays) and after\nmonths of emails\nit seemed a good\nextension for us\nto bring together\nartists we thought huddled under\nthe same brolly. The idea is as simple\nas bringing two artists or groups together whose work shares similarities,\nbe they timbral or compositional, and\nthen sit them on a split together. The\ntape split was common property within noise/industrial/post-punk scenes\nand I see no reason why it can\u2019t function in the same way for more formed\nmusics.\nRG: Any \ufb01nal comments?\nSB: Thank you everyone, artists, cus-tomers, friends and family for helping\nme with the label. Without you all it\nis nothing but a chubby dude on Facebook squinting at 3 a.m.\nhttp://opaltapes.bandcamp.com/\nhttp://blowinguptheworkshop.com/\nDuring a week\u2019s worth of listening to\nthe radio an average of 0-3 new songs\nmake me drop everything, frown a little in an e\ufb00ort to identify the song /\nartist, then \ufb01ddle a little with the time\nbar on the listen-again player to \ufb01gure\nout what exactly the wonderful noise\nis.\nLast week this came in the form of\nMS MR, a New York Duo whose debut album Secondhand Rapture is set\nfor release on the 14th May. As their\nrereleased single \u201cHurricane\u201d burst\nonto the airwaves, the creepy intro of\nwhat resembles a slowed down version of a knife being sharpened was\nattention grabbing enough within a\nfew seconds.\nThe vocals of Lizzy Plapinger\nsmoothly drip o\ufb00 the dark and slow\nmusical bed. True to pop music, they\nare de\ufb01nitely the forefront of MS MR\u2019s\nstyle rather being given an equal\nweight with the other instruments.\nThis is no bad thing. In a time saturated with Adele / Winehouse-esque\nvocals, it is kind of nice to go back to\na good American pop accent but with\nmore grit than Taylor Swift-type\nvocals. Crudely, MS MR have been\ncompared to Lana and Florence but\npersonally I\u2019d add a bit of Paramore\nand Wild Beasts in the mix.\n\u201cHurricane\u201d is de\ufb01nitely the highlight of Secondhand Rapture, being\nthe right mix of mystery, an apathetic\nkind of sadness, and a musical depth\nthat a lot of pop songs compromise on\nin order to build a good level of catchi-ness. This depth is a vibe which runs\nthrough the whole album and is probably thanks to the lovely way which\nPlapinger \ufb02oats over Hershenow\u2019s\nproduction, both of which quieten and\nre\ufb02ect, or suddenly burst into noise\n(probably the reason for the Florence\ncomparisons) at the right times.\nOther highlights include the way\nwhich the word \u2018buuurn\u2019 is sung on\n\u201cDark Woo Wop\u201d, and \u201cSalty Sweet\u201d\nwhich has a hidden darkness behind\nits poppy fa\u00e7ade.\nIt will be interesting to see the audience which MS MR will draw in.\nSlightly too poppy for the \u2018indie-guitar\u2019\nfans, maybe not poppy enough to become as mainstream as Lana; they\u2019re\nnot the most original band around at\nthe moment but Secondhand Rapture\nbrings a temporary refreshing break\nto the table that many artists currently\ndo not.\nLily Le Writer\n\n"

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 10 MAY 15\nfter marching through\nthe tourists packing\nTower Bridge, I was\nworried that the Design Museum might be\nhidden amongst the caf\u00e9s and small\nshops of the narrow brick walkways\nlining the riverside. Of course, it\nwasn\u2019t. Bright, white, shining at the\nend of, rather than part of, a shadowy almost-alley, it is a building that\nexudes contemporary, minimal, and\nunderstated.\nThe Designs of the Year show is\ndisplayed in a single room which\ngreets you with a yellow interior and\nblock writing. Think... the shininess\nof West\ufb01elds in a museum. Perhaps\nthe exhibition\u2019s venue, a centre devoted to design, makes one more\naware of its own layout. Although it\nis no di\ufb00erent from galleries in the\nTate or Barbican you are instantly\nmore aware of where you tread even\nbefore the exhibition begins.\nThe competition, run by the museum itself, is separated into seven categories. It is categorised by\nthemes which link certain designs\nrather than by functional category.\nThese include the way in which design communicates meaning, the\nmanipulation of science and technol-ogy, the invitation to question and\ninteract, and also colour, function,\nand memory.\nOn show were nominees and win-ners. All are real-life designs and include the familiar such as the revamp\nof Exhibition Road, the Shard, and\nthe Olympic Cauldron.\nSome designs were interesting, but\nhardly mind-blowing. Stop, stare, an\nutterance of \u201coh\u201d and onto the next.\nOthers seemed downright bad. For\nsome reason the furniture section\nconsisted of many uncomfortable\nlooking, sti\ufb00 chairs scattered around\nthe place made from anything from\nwood to plastic, metal rings to iron\nspikes, and bits of driftwood.\nNevertheless, many were intriguing and invited discussion, debate,\nand sometimes admiration. A number of the architectural designs fell\ninto this category. They all displayed\nthat contemporary and modern vibe\nemanating from the Design Museum\nitself.\nA particular highlight was the\nBook Mountain in Spijkenisse, Netherlands which is exactly that \u2013 a\nmountain of books which form a li-brary. Wooden frames reference the\nbarns of the local agricultural heritage and its homage to oversized,\nmajestic landscapes serves as a nifty\nvisual advert for reading.\nUnfortunately, it is rather far for a\nquick visit and so the Clapham One\nLibrary is probably a more realistic\ndestination. It was di\ufb03cult to completely appreciate its design due to\nonly a couple of photos and a small-scale model on display. But the mo-saic-like pattern of the placing of the\nwindows had me at \ufb01rst glance.\nMy favourite category was the\nproduct designs. It was full of the\nmost innovative and original ideas.\nFor example, faceture vases, which\ndue to their handmade production\nprocess, were all totally unique. Coloured resin is poured into a plastic\nmould which slightly reshapes it as it\ncools, and when the mould is peeled\naway the triangular patterns stick out\nat di\ufb00erent angles which re\ufb02ect light\nor form shadow emulating the e\ufb00ect\nof pixels on an image. Its style, although dated, de\ufb01nes our digital era\n\u2013 in a vase, who would have thought?\nNot knowing much about cars and\nbicycles, it was di\ufb03cult to decide\nwhat to think about several of the\ntransport entries. Chainless bicycle\nand cute small car? Sounds good to\nme, I guess. What was an obviously\nexcellent idea though was the Air Access wheelchair which can slot into\nan aeroplane seat frame which prevents disabled passengers from having to be lifted onto stationary seats.\nThe fashion and graphics entries\nwere slightly disappointing. The former included collections from well\nknown names such as Giles Deacon,\nComme des Garcons, Louis Vuitton,\nPrada, and Proenza Schouler but\nI failed to see the reason for their\nnominations above anything else. Alexa Chung for Madewell will do for\nme thanks.\nFor a similar reason, none of the\ngraphical exhibits struck me as particularly innovative. Everyone is\naware of that chunky minimalist\nfont on a plain fuss-free background,\nused just about everywhere is slightly arty and modern. It was certainly\nused just about everywhere in these\nLily Le reviews the Designs of the Year\nentries.\nThe most interesting feature in\nthis category was the rebranding of\nAustralian cigarette packets. Identical, plain and plastered in ugly health\nwarnings, the brands are given a\nsmall space to print their name on\nan olive coloured background (ap-parently the least pleasant colour to\nsee on a design). It is supposed to\ndemote brand loyalty (and obviously\nput everyone o\ufb00 cigarettes) but most\ninteresting is its demonstration of\ndesign in controlling consumer be-haviour.\nThis time the tools are in the hands\nof the government for the sake of\npublic health, treading on the toes of\ndesign freedom. What cultural implications will this have?\nYou may have noticed that I haven\u2019t\nmentioned any of the winners. The\noverall victor was chosen from the\ndigital category.\nI am not going to tell you but I will\ntell you what it was not. It was not\nthe Windows Phone 8 app which\nallows mobile devices to communicate by birdsong. Neither was it a\nlight\ufb01eld camera that allows users to\nmanipulate the focus of the fore and\nbackground of photos after they have\nbeen taken.\nI would suggest a visit to the Design Museum to \ufb01nd them out for\nyourself. While debating whether the\nwinners are worthy, the signi\ufb01cance\nof design comes to life. In an age\nwhere we have the luxury of not having to compromise between aesthet-ics, function and trends, we forget\nabout the designs of products, which\nwe live around and base our worlds\non. It is a brilliant idea to remind us\nof the importance of design by celebrating some of the best examples\nin an immersive public forum.\nThe Design of the Year awards run\nat the Design Museum until June 07.\nTicket prices around \u00a312.\nA\nForm before f(x)\n\n"

    "content": "Dream a little Greek dream\nW\nTRAVEL\nFRIDAY 10 MAY\n24\nTravel Editor:\nVeronika McQuade\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nith summer vacations just a\nstone\u2019s throw\naway, it seemed\nideal for me to\nthink about possible summer desti-nations. The \ufb01rst thing that crosses\nall our minds when thinking about\nsummer is, of course, sun, and consequently we think about Mediterranean countries. This article will be\ndedicated to my personal home coun-try, namely Greece.\nGreece is quite a diverse country,\nwith beautiful beaches, small villages but also mountains and big cit-ies, hence it has everything a tourist\nwould wish for. Below some of the\nbeauties will be presented. Of course,\nthese are just a small portion of the\nsights in this country. Focus will not\nbe on the most touristic places, as\nthese are well known and reported,\nbut on the more hidden gems of this\ncountry.\nCrete, Falasarna beach\nThe biggest island in Greece, located\nin the southern part of the country\ncombines the beauty of the sea and\nthe mountains. It is the perfect destination for anyone who wants to relax\nfrom the humdrum of everyday life,\nbut at the same time wants to explore\nthe nightlife options.\nOne of my favourite beaches is\n\u201cFalasarna\u201d, located in the western\npart of the island. With the wonderful\ncombination of sun and sea, the beach\nis also under protection through the\nEU Natura 2000 project. It is quite a\nbig beach, thus even if it is crowded\nyou won\u2019t feel su\ufb00ocated as it usually\nhappens in the summertime. The only\ndrawback would have to be the northern winds, making it sometimes di\ufb03cult to swim and enjoy the sea. Otherwise it is just the perfect place to go; it\nis also close to Chania, one of the big\ncities of the island, which o\ufb00ers many\noptions for sightseeing, Greek cuisine\ntasting and nightlife.\nKastoria\nIf the sea is not for you and you want\na place near the mountains, where it\nis of course chillier, even during the\nsummer, then Kastoria is the place for\nyou. It is located in the North-west of\nthe country and it is a fairly small city,\no\ufb00ering a vast range of activities and\nsightseeing options.\nWhat makes this city unique and\nattracts visitors, is the magic atmosphere it conveys with the successful\ncombination of mountains and the\nlake. One can walk aside the lake and\nenjoy the fresh air and the scenery or\nexplore the inside of the city. There\nare many byzantine churches, which\nare worth a visit and also there is a\nfolklore museum, located inside an\nold mansion, where one can travel\nto the past and imagine how people\nused to live. In the vicinity of the city\nthere is a Neolithic lakeshore settle-ment, called \u201cDispilio\u201d, located on the\nlake, where one can admire the early\ne\ufb00orts of mankind to establish residential areas.\nFor the more relaxed visitors, the\ncity o\ufb00ers spectacular cuisine as well\nand it is famous for the di\ufb00erent kinds\nof pie and the traditional desserts.\nThessaloniki\nMoving a bit to the south again the second biggest city in Greece, Thessaloniki, can be found, located directly by the\nsea. The city itself o\ufb00ers a wide range\nof activities and sightseeing options.\nThere are many museums and also the\nold town walls, where one can enjoy\nthe view of the whole city from above.\nThe most famous landmark of this city\nis the \u201cWhite tower\u201d. One can go up the\ntower and again admire the breathtaking view of the city and the sea. My favourite activity in this city is walking by\nthe seaside, which is quite relaxing and\nhelps clear one\u2019s mind.\nIn close vicinity to the city, just a\nsmall drive away, one can go the beautiful beaches of Chalkidiki and enjoy the\nsun and the sea. My personal favourite\nis the second \u201cleg\u201d of Chalkidiki, with\nfewer visitors.\nOn the other hand, if you happen\nto be a bit more adventurous person,\nyou can visit the highest mountain in\nGreece \u201cOlympus\u201d, the mythical mountain of the Gods, located 150 km from\nThessaloniki. Olympus is famous for its\nhiking and walking paths, which can be\naccessed throughout the year.\nThe city o\ufb00ers restaurants with great\ncuisine, which please even the most demanding food-lovers and it is the most\nfamous city for its nightlife opportunities and it\u2019s called \u201cthe city that never\nsleeps\u201d\u2026\nAs you can see Greece is a huge country with di\ufb00erent sceneries throughout\nits area, so you can choose what is most\nappropriate for you. Start packing,\nGreece awaits you!!!\nNatalia Petrou introduces you to the wonders of Greece\nAll photos: Natalia Petrou\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201c\nOli Benton\nmperial College doesn\u2019t care\nabout its students and there\u2019s\nnothing we can do to change\nit. The Sabbs are generally\npowerless and many of the\nUnion\u2019s decisions don\u2019t seem to have\nour best interests at heart.\nMuch like a certain yeasty (and\ndelicious) sandwich \ufb01lling, those\nstatements will either strike a chord\nwith you or be they will dismissed\nout of hand as an exaggeration. They\nshouldn\u2019t be. They sum up everything\nthat is wrong about Imperial; why the\nNSS rating is so low, why we\u2019re never\ngoing to \u2018beat\u2019 Oxbridge, why the attendance at the bars is falling and why\nthose controversial halls in North Acton are going to be built, whether you\nlike it or not.\nCollege\u2019s unrelenting apathy towards its students and academic\nsta\ufb00, its disregard for their views and\nopinions is not a new development\n(Holland Club/Translation Unit/bioscience cuts anyone?) and only continues to drag Imperial down. Without an e\ufb00ective Union countering\nthis, the slide into anonymity will be\neven quicker.\nRecently the Medics protested the\nBUCS merger of Medic and College\nsports teams. This is a contentious is-sue, but only between the administrators and the people actually playing\nthe sport. It is something even most\nrival rugby players can agree on and\nthe reasons behind it are worth examining as they are endemic to College thinking. Is having two separate\nsports teams a historical relic or is it\nupholding 148 years of tradition, 148\nyears that once lost can never be re-covered? Why go through the e\ufb00ort\nof restructuring the whole system,\nand if the sports teams are merged,\nwhy stop there? Why not absorb the\nwhole Medic SU, make their President a DP(Medicine), make Reynolds Eastside II and have done with\nit? BUCS points. All universities are\nranked by BUCS points, which are\ngained for doing well in sport with\nthe BUCS leagues. Imperial College\ncurrently sits at 20th. If the Medics\u2019 points were included we\u2019d go up\na place to 19th. I can\u2019t even begin\nto imagine how many more athletic\nsporty people that extra spot is going\nto attract. However, I believe the negative impact of the merger includes\nless access to sports for everyone\nand less money spent on sports as a\nwhole (for example, ICURFC and ICSMRFC both support 3 rugby teams.\nIf they merged, maintaining a total of\nfour teams would be more realistic)\nlet alone having to \ufb01nd new Varsity\nrivals.\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t care about them messing with the sports, I want to know\nwhy they are still going to build those\nhalls that everybody is so against!\u201d\nThey will carry on regardless because\nI\nImperial College is good at business.\nReally good, (for example the site of\nthe new campus in West London was\nobtained cheaply through shrewd investment and property deals) and the\nmoney has already been spent. Do\nyou think the developer is going to\nrefund the money for a few stickers\nplastered around the Union build-ing? The buildings are already being\nbuilt so stopping it is as likely being\nserved quickly in Metric on an ACC\nnight. Paul Beaumont was part of the\ndecisions and has been vehemently\nagainst it from the start; look how\nmuch they listened to him. Either his\ninclusion was a box ticking exercise,\nhe was ine\ufb00ective in putting his views\nacross, or a combination of both.\n#Againstacton is trying to make a\ndi\ufb00erence but now his hands are tied\nand it is too late, like trying to shut\nthe gate after the horse is already on\nTesco\u2019s shelves. So now the halls are\nde\ufb01nitely going to be built, the Union\nshould be pushing for a massive increase in infrastructure like lobbying\nthe council to upgrade the roads and\ncycle network around there (the potholes are awful) or \ufb01nd some money\nin the inevitable pro\ufb01ts to run buses\nbetween campuses. While the buildings are going to be built, meshing\nthis satellite campus with the existing services is an area that the Union\ncould really make a di\ufb00erence in.\nSo why do College disregard us so?\nWhy are they still going to build those\nhalls and merge the sports teams even\nwhen nobody really wants it? You\u2019ll\nbe gone in three years. In four years\nno one will remember a time without\nhalls in North Acton or when Varsity\nwas Medics vs College; it will be the\nnorm to have an hour commute in as\na fresher and to play Varsity against\nRoehampton. College will have made\nmoney from their decisions, money\nto help subsidise your labs, and the\nperson who made the relevant decisions will still be in their job while\nyou\u2019ll have graduated and be slaving\naway, working 70+ hours a week in\na dingy o\ufb03ce doing consultancy and\nselling your soul so you won\u2019t care ei-ther. In my opinion, this game is too\nshort sighted for Imperial to play if\nthey have any aspirations other than\nthe \ufb01nancial ones. The NSS ratings\nwill continue to slide, people\u2019s experience here will become worse and\nworse and the continued slip into\nanonymity; academically, sportingly\nand socially will hasten. To quote\nMorpheus, IC \u201care the gatekeep-ers. They are guarding all the doors,\nthey are holding all the keys. Which\nmeans that sooner or later, someone\nis going to have to \ufb01ght them.\u201d While\nI\u2019m not advocating bending spoons,\nstopping bullets with your hands or\nanything else from the Matrix, something needs to be done and despite\ngreasing their palms handsomely, the\nSabbs don\u2019t seem to have the stomach\nor the weapons for this \ufb01ght.\nSo College doesn\u2019t care and really\nit\u2019s not College\u2019s problem, that\u2019s why\nthey fund the Union; the Union is\nsupposed to be the brake on the slide.\nOur voice, how we can tell the College what we want and need. Unfortunately our brake cable has been cut.\nThe Sabbs have very little in\ufb02uence\nand nobody seems to make any real\nprogress. While this may seem harsh,\ncan anyone name any of the Deputy\nPresidents from two years ago? And\nwhat were their policies, what did\nthey achieve? Are the Freshers even\naware of Summerballgate that cost\ntheir Union \u00a3128k? If that can slip\ninto dim and distant memory, what\nhope do less notorious O\ufb03cers hope\nto achieve?\nObviously the Sabbs kept the Union working, they kept it ticking over\nand that\u2019s great. However from a\nsmall team of people that we\u2019re paying \u00a3186k a year I\u2019d expect a lot more.\nYes, in 2011/12 we paid \u00a3186,098\nfor Sabbatical Salaries and accom-modation. What do we get back\nfor this huge sum of money? Do we\neven know if they are doing their job\nproperly? I hope they are and I would\nhope that doing your job properly\nconsists of a lot more than keeping\nthe Union ticking over. In my naivety\nI would assume that\u2019s one of the jobs\nof the hardworking team of permanent Union sta\ufb00 (~420k combined\nsalary in 2011/12). I want my elected\no\ufb03cers to \ufb01ght for change, to make\nmy time here better and to protect\nmy interests from the businessmen\nwho run IC. So have they done this?\nThey haven\u2019t come close for me, but\nwhat about the wider populous?\nHowever, what I didn\u2019t want was\nthese people that represent my views\nto go out of their way to stop me enjoying my time here. The list is long\nand oft repeated; entry charges, tankard prices and e\ufb00ectively banning\nyards are all factors that contribute\nto the decline of any semblance of a\nsocial scene and these are just within\nthe Union Bar!\nDespite all these negativities social-ness does still thrive, if you look for it.\nI just wish that someone actually gave\na ha\u2019penny for what we thought about\nour time here when we\u2019re not giving\nthem money or passing exams. I wish\nthe Union could \ufb01ght the good \ufb01ght\nand support its students. I love being\nat Imperial and have had a great three\nyears here already, but just think how\ngreat this place could be; think of the\npotential.\nSo why do\nCollege disregard us so?\n... You\u2019ll be\ngone in three\nyears. In four\nyears no one\nwill remember a time\nwithout halls\nin North Acton or when\nVarsity was\nMedics vs\nCollege\nAn uncaring university\n9\nFRIDAY 10 MAY\n\n"

The difference between audience members\nwill be, instead, that some will favour\nthese \ufb02ashes of energy whilst others\nwill prefer the more serene moments,\nperfectly showcasing Cece Wyldeck\u2019s\npure treble voice. The music mixes\nthese lullaby moments with tinges\nof dark rock perfectly. The powerful\nguitar strokes in the upbeat numbers\nresonate and are de\ufb01nitely addictive.\nDespite having only formed in March\n2012, the band play as if they had been\ntogether for years, understanding exactly how to blend perfectly with each\nother throughout the variation in\nDark-FolkersWyldeckinConversation\nJulia Spindel chatstothebandinthefirstofaninterviewdoubleteam\nsongs. They clearly enjoy the experience and so does the audience. Wyldeck\u2019s songs are rich in memorable\nri\ufb00s and \ufb02owing melodies, successfully reminiscent of lost folk songs.\nI spoke to Wyldeck before their set\nat the Underbelly in Hoxton a few\nweeks ago. They\u2019d eaten too much at\ndinner and were trying not to curl up\nand nap. Cece, dressed all in white,\nhad employed three napkins to avoid\nfood stains and all had had to tie up\ntheir hair. Here\u2019s what they had to say:\nJulia Spindel: So how did Wyldeck come about?\nWyldeck: We\u2019re all from south-west\nLondon and we\u2019ve known each other\nfor ages. The boys met when they were\n4 or something, then Cece met them\naged 10 (when girls were allowed to\njoin girls scouts). The boys had a Led\nW\nZeppelin tribute type band and had\nT-shirts and everything. Later on\nCece and Dave were in a punk pop\nband that played alongside 2:54 (for-merly the Vulgarians) and headlined\nbefore The xx. After a couple of years\nof this we had a couple of years o\ufb00\nduring which Cece wrote and debated\na solo career. But after some late night\ndrunken texts, the Wyldeck group\nwas agreed on. It clicked in the \ufb01rst\nrehearsal.\nJS: What\u2019s your favourite and least\nfavourite aspect of being musician?\nW: Our favourite aspect is de\ufb01nitely\nplaying your instrument and doing\ngigs. It\u2019s always great when people tell\nyou how much they\u2019ve enjoyed themselves after we\u2019ve put the e\ufb00ort in.\nSometimes the free drinks are good\nbut sometimes not. We\u2019re not rock\nand roll enough to get trashed before\nour set! Our least favourite aspect is\nthe social media side of stu\ufb00 \u2013 we just\nwant to make music without the has-sle!\nJS: How do you guys write a new\nsong?\nW: Usually one of us puts something down then the others \ufb01ne-tune\nit. Sometimes it\u2019s Cece, sometimes\nDom and sometimes Jacob. Jacob\u2019s\njust written a song called \u201cBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s\nbaby\u201d. You can try and shout for it\nas an encore later if you like! We all\nknow when a song isn\u2019t working. The\nbest ones are written really quickly\nand those are the ones we play live,\nthere\u2019s no arguing. There are lots we\nnever play. Sometimes songs that we\nstarted to write ages ago resurface\nand are \ufb01nally \ufb01nished just because\nit\u2019s a better time for them. The other\nday we \ufb01nished one Cece wrote 7\nyears ago.\nJS: What would be your advice for\nmusicians just starting out?\nW: Do it for fun, especially at the\nstart. Don\u2019t take yourself too seri-ously. Sometimes dreamers are the\nones that have enough determination\nto get somewhere but it\u2019s best to be\npersonable too and not have too massive an ego.\nJS: What were your \ufb01rst music pur-chases?\nW: Aqua, Shanks and Bigfoot, Fatboy Slim. (Cece) Then during our\npunk pop phase I liked the Yeah Yeah\nYeahs and stu\ufb00. Now I\u2019m more into\nFleetwood Mac. My \ufb01rst concert was\nthe Backstreet Boys.\nJS: And what are you listening to\nnow?\nW: Daughter, Prince, HAIM, Cat\nPower, Polica, Kendrick Lamar,\nKanye West.\nJS: Who would you most like to\nmeet?\nW: (Cece) I\u2019ve met idols before and\nit\u2019s been disappointing. Maybe it\u2019s\nbest to keep them just as idols. (Boys)\nBut we would like to party with people that know a good time. Kanye\nWest or Prince maybe. But you would\nhave to prepare yourself.\nJS: Who\u2019s your favourite on the\nLondon gigging scene at the mo-ment?\nW: Phillious Williams. There are a\nlot of nights going on at the moment\ninvolving very similar indie bands but\nthey\u2019re doing something a bit di\ufb00erent. Mark has a great voice but speaks\ncompletely di\ufb00erently!\nJS: What do you think of the London gigging scene in general?\nW: People that do come along are impressed and the fans we do get are really dedicated and come to gigs again\nand again. We\u2019ve learnt that we have\nto gig less often and write new material to make the repeated trips worthwhile for those people. Every couple of\nmonths we have a new song. Tonight\nwe\u2019re playing 9 songs, our longest set\nyet, with two new songs.\nJS: And, \ufb01nally, what are your next\nplans?\nW: We\u2019re playing some festivals this\nsummer \u2013 Wilderness festival, Damn\nDead Circus (set up by Phillious Williams) and Hamswell. But we\u2019ll do an\nEP \ufb01rst as that\u2019s a halfway step to an\nalbum in terms of how many killer\nsongs you give away at once.\nAMS album of the week\nSuspiciously named and sensibly abbrevi-ated, ASIWYFA are a 4 piece who play instrumental rock. Their sound is probably\nbest summarised by the title of their best\nknown track, \u201cSet Guitars To Kill\u201d - hyperactive arena rock made to be heard from so\nclose to the band that you can feel splinters\nflying from the drumsticks. Their self-titled\ndebut released in 2009 benefited from the\nband\u2019s extensive catalogue of well-practiced\ndemos, recorded with spacious production\nfocusing on bringing out the wide variety of moods the group could create.\nTheir second album, Gangs, adopted a more familiar mix, but fell just shy of\nbeing truly memorable when compared to their first album.\nAll Hail Bright Futures dropped in March of this year, landing squarely in familiar territory. Despite a switch of guitarist and a long break from touring, the\nalbum is full of the moshy aggression and tight musicianship we have come to\nexpect, now married to a jubilant mood that covers the whole album in rainbows and sunshine. New guitarist Niall Kennedy gives the cheerful pop riffs of\nhis last band, Panama Kings, a new light, without dumbing down the format of\na good instrumental track.\nConsidering the album\u2019s production, what really seals the deal is the range of\nnew guitar sounds, likely inspired by genre contemporaries Battles and Adebisi Shank. Tracks like \u201cAMBULANCE\u201d use a warm, fuzzy, honky-tonk sound\nakin to the tone of an ice-cream truck piano. This is especially effective when\njuxtaposed with ASIWYFA\u2019s heavy moments. Gang vocals, chants and weeping synthesisers make a welcome return without removing the focus from the\ninterplay between instruments.\nPerhaps what the band loses with this album that was so strong on their previous releases was the ability to create a more varied song. Tracks clock in a\nlittle more than 4 minutes, and no longer possess a slow build of ideas or melodies \u2013 rather, they dart around, with the attention span of a small child, burning through riffs and noodly math rock passages as if they can\u2019t wait to get it\nfinished. The album\u2019s closer \u201cYoung Bright Minds\u201d is a partial response to this,\nfeaturing a 7 minute exploration of a riff that doesn\u2019t really compare to their\nprevious epic tracks, like \u201cDon\u2019t Waste Time\u2026\u201d from their self-titled. Rather, the\nband focuses on one mood throughout the album \u2013 relentless delight \u2013 and captures it perfectly. That\u2019s very special indeed.\nAnd So I Watch You From Afar:AllHailBrightFutures\nRobin Thomas\nWyldeck in the wylderness\n\n"

    "content": "Helter skelter helicenes\nLaurence Pope interviews Dr Fuchter, a synthetic and medicinal chemist at ICL\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 10 MAY\n12\nDr Matthew Fuchter is a Senior\nLecturer in Synthetic and Medicinal\nchemistry at Imperial College London. In close collaboration with Dr\nAlasdair Campbell from the department of Physics, Dr Fuchter and his research group have dedicated some of\ntheir research to OLEDs and a group\nof molecules known as helicenes.\nLaurence Pope: So what is an\nOLED? How do they di\ufb00er from\nregular LEDs?\nDr Matthew Fuchter: OLED stands\nfor organic light-emitting diode. They\ndi\ufb00er from regular LEDs in that the luminescent material used within them\nis organic, i.e. carbon-based. This organic material can be a molecule of\nlow molecular weight, or a polymer.\nLP: Your work focuses partly on\nhelicenes. What makes them so important in OLED research?\nMF: My group\u2019s research came from\na molecular interest in this class of\nmolecule. When we started this work\nhelicenes hadn\u2019t been explored in any\ndepth as an OLED emissive material.\nThere are already small molecules and\npolymers that have arisen from academic and industrial research which\nproduce light emitting devices with\ngood e\ufb03ciencies, wide colour pallets,\nlong-lasting stability and so forth.\nWe came from another angle, exploring a feature of the helicene itself.\nHelicenes are thermally-stable polycyclic aromatics. Aromatic molecules\nare \ufb02at, but if you start to fuse them\ntogether you get to a point where the\npolyfused system can\u2019t lie \ufb02at, as the\nrings start to bump into one another.\nThat introduces a kink or a spiral into\nthe molecule. Their electrons are still\nfully conjugated, but the molecule is\nno longer \ufb02at.\nWhy are they interesting? For devic-es, I see there to be two key interesting\nfeatures.\nBecause they\u2019re not \ufb02at, how they\npack in the solid state is somewhat\ndi\ufb00erent to common OLED materials,\nwhich are \ufb02at. How molecules pack\ntogether in the solid state is important,\nwith rami\ufb01cations on light emission.\nBut also, because helicenes are heli-cal, they\u2019re also chiral, and can therefore come in left- and right-handed\nforms. We were interested in how this\nchirality could potentially be exploited\nin organic devices.\nPutting these features together we\nwanted to explore the idea of using\nhelicenes as the organic emissive material in OLEDs. It\u2019s an interesting new\nclass of molecule in their own right,\nbut also have the potential to directly\ngenerate polarised light.\nLight can be polarised in certain\nways. One form is circularly polarised\n(CP) light, where the light wave traverses as a helix, which also comes in\nleft- and right-handed forms. Standard OLEDs produce unpolarised light,\nwhich needs to be specially \ufb01ltered\nto generate CP light. We wondered\nwhether you could use these chiral\nhelicenes to generate a certain handedness of CP light.\nTo cut a long story short we found\nwe needed a mix of organic materials,\nblended with small amounts of either\nleft- or right-handed helicenes with\nconventional, non-chiral material.\nThese OLEDs were able to produce\ncircularly polarised light using di\ufb00erent handed helicenes. It wasn\u2019t 100%\nCP light, but rather enriched light.\nLP: How does the chirality of the\nhelicene molecule control the chirality of the light?\nMF: We\u2019re not sure why mechanisti-cally. Light emission is generated from\nthe non-chiral polymer, not the heli-cene. It therefore looks like the heli-cene is interacting with the polymer\nin some way, most likely changing the\nconformation of the polymer to emit\ncircularly polarised light. Almost certainly the helicene is in\ufb02uencing the\npolymer structure, possibly organising\nit into a helical conformation.\nLP: So where is your research now\nheading?\nMF: There are a few di\ufb00erent directions we\u2019re heading in. One angle is\nmore focused on commercial technologies based on this, further validating its e\ufb00ect using other polymers\nand helicenes. How good can we get\nthis? Can we fabricate OLEDs that can\nmatch up to state of the art devices\nwhilst also generating CP-light? Can\nwe tune the wavelength to emit more\nthan just one colour of light? There are\nstill a lot of unanswered questions!\nAcademically, we want to further\nstudy what is happening, what the\nhelicene is doing to the polymer. How\ndoes that relate to the e\ufb00ect? Helicenes are fully conjugated molecules,\nwhich can carry charge and emit and\nabsorb light on their own. Potentially\nyou could further tune the helicene to\nimprove the performance of the device in terms of conductivity or light\nemission.\nBeyond that, OLEDs are one example of plastic electronics. This encompasses a whole range of OLED devices,\nsuch as organic transistors, organic\nsolar cells and so on. Do helicenes\nhave applicability with other devices?\nDo they have any advantage, with their\nchiral property? Again, we still don\u2019t\nknow just yet.\nLP: Has much research been carried\nout with helicenes before?\nMF: There are some patents out there\nthat claim novelty over the use of\nhelicenes in OLEDs. None of them\nhowever have claimed the chirality\nof helicenes, as they use the racemic\nmixture, a mix of left- and right- handed molecules. Their claims of novelty\nstem from the helicene\u2019s thermal stability properties.\nLP: What particular applications\ncan you see arising from this re-search?\nMF: There are several potential appli-cations, some fairly immediate, others more long-term. One application\nof CP OLEDs is as the backlight of an\nLCD, leading to more energy e\ufb03cient\ndisplays.\n3D cinema relies on CP-light, split\nbetween your two eyes. In theory you\ncould fabricate an OLED TV that uti-lises di\ufb00erent CP pixels to create a thin,\nfully \ufb02exible 3D display with di\ufb00erent\npixels emitting di\ufb00erent CP light.\nIn photonics, the technology of\nlight, there\u2019s an interest in CP-light\nemitting and CP-light detecting de-vices. Optical communications is for\nme an interesting area, which relies on\na light source being on or o\ufb00 to transfer information. Using an intercon-vertible CP-light source could double\nchannel capacity, from just on and o\ufb00\nto on, on-left, on-right and o\ufb00.\nLP: How would you sum up the signi\ufb01cance of your research into heli-cene use in OLEDs?\nMF: The signi\ufb01cance for me lies in the\nnovelty in what we\u2019ve discovered. I\nwould make two statements.\nWe are the \ufb01rst research group to\nshow that a chiral small molecule dopant can induce polymer OLEDs to\ndirectly emit CP light. This is the \ufb01rst\ntime it\u2019s been shown that you can use\ndopants in this approach.\nThis is also the \ufb01rst study to use\nasymmetrically pure helicenes in this\nregard. There are very few papers focusing on this asymmetrical mix.\nTo read more about the Fuchter\nGroup\u2019s research visit imperial.ac.uk/\nfuchtergroup.

There are white beaches,\nfascinating Mayan ruins and magni\ufb01cent colonial cities. It seems that the\nonly two drawbacks to this balmy \u201cYucat\u00e1n\u201d Peninsula are that place names\nare unpronounceable (try \u201cXkeken\u201d or\n\u201cXcaret\u201d) and that although the street\nfood looks great, it might be regretted\nlater.\nThe Yucatecan feature perhaps\nmost alien to us Englishmen is the\n\u201ccenote\u201d. Thousands of these magni\ufb01cent underground sinkholes pepper\nthe river-free land. The Mayans relied\non cenotes for drinking water and the\noccasional swim; they say that after\nswimming in a cenote, you emerge 5\nyears younger. In addition, some were\nused for human sacri\ufb01ce such as the\nhaunting Sacred Cenote at Chichen\nItza used in the appeasement of the\nrain God, Chaac.\nSince cenotes provide much amusement to the tourist, many are open\nto the public. Some of the more entrepreneurial Mexicans in Cuzama\nlead what can only be described as a\n\u201ccenote-athon\u201d, that is, visiting three\ncenotes in as many hours. Anaemiclooking horses transport tourists from\none cenote to the next on carts run on\nrail tracks. The guide-book warned us\nthat this mode of transport could jar\n\ufb01llings loose. This I can believe. Relief\nfrom the bumpy ride comes, however,\nwhen another cart approaches from\nthe opposite direction: you must slow\ndown and either stand your ground, or\ndisembark and intentionally derail the\ncart, in order to let the other pass!\nThe cenotes themselves are deep\nunderground and can be accessed either by slippery stone steps, or as in\none case, a perilously \ufb02imsy step lad-der. However, this inconvenience is\nde\ufb01nitely worth it. The water, which I\nshould add must be shared with \ufb01sh,\nis a surprisingly comfortable tem-perature, crystal clear and awesomely\ndeep; diving opportunities are ample.\nImpressive stalactites hang down to\nnearly within reach and bats nest on\nthe cave\u2019s ceiling. It\u2019s a swimming experience like no other and after three\ncenotes, although I still appeared the\nsame age, I certainly felt more alive.\nAnother unparalleled Yucatecan\nswimming opportunity presents itself\nat Tulum. Here stand the remains of\na late-Maya city still occupied during\nand after the Spanish arrival. Although\nnot as impressive architecturally as\nother Maya sites, Tulum is perched on\na cli\ufb00 next to the Caribbean Sea giving\nit a picture-postcard beauty. On the\nbeach its \u201cCastillo\u201d is clearly visible.\nThe sand is white and the sea inviting.\nStop taking photos and get in!\nAll photos: Stephanie Walton\nStephanie Walton thinks you should vamos to South America\nM\nRead online: felixonline.co.uk\nGone on holiday recently?

Behind the actors, o\ufb00\nto the side, there will be a dedicated\nteam of people bringing the stage to\nlife; lighting, staging, and sound design all form the invisible heart of\nthe production, playing with the audience\u2019s emotions in subtle ways and\ncreating the magic that keeps people\nreturning to the stalls. This team are\nusually hidden, their work not fully\nappreciated \u2013 nor understood \u2013 by\nthe theatre-going crowd. But what\nhappens when this world is brought\ninto the open and placed under the\nbrilliantly bright stage lights? It is a\nquestion that director Katie Mitchell has attempted to answer with her\nstunning production of Fra\u00fclein Julie,\nwhich seamlessly merges technology\nand stagecraft to form a new kind of\ntheatrical experience.\nA radical interpretation of Strindberg\u2019s 1888 original play, Maja Zade\u2019s\ntranslation has cut out large portions\nof the script, shifting the focus from\nthe eponymous Fra\u00fclein to Kristin\n(Jule B\u00f6we), the cook who can only\nobserve as her \ufb01anc\u00e9 Jean (Tilman\nStrau\u00df) enters into a romantic tryst\nwith Fra\u00fclein Julie (Luise Wolfram).\nThis alone is already a radical departure from the traditional Strindberg,\nbut Mitchell\u2019s meticulous production\ndesign and staging challenge the conventions of tradition even further.\nThe action takes place on a midsummer\u2019s night at a Swedish country\nestate, and a large proportion of the\nstage is taken up with the kitchen in\nwhich Kristin works; closed o\ufb00 to the\naudience, the only way we can see\ninside is through the windows. However, an enormously talented camera-crew have invaded the set, and what\nthey \ufb01lm is shown, live, above the\nstage. The e\ufb00ect is startling; the audience is both removed from the action,\nand shown it in excruciating detail.\nWe get to see the pain in Kristin\u2019s face\nup close \u2013 every movement or twitch\ntaking on a new importance\nThis is not the only way in which the\naudience gets to see what they would\nnormally not be able to. Mitchell has\nsaid that with this production she\nis attempting \u2018theatrical cubism\u2019 \u2013\nshowing all the di\ufb00erent levels of the\nproduction simultaneously \u2013 and she\nlives up to her word. As well as the\ncamera-crew there are two soundproof recording studios o\ufb00 to the side,\nwhere actors enter to record internal\nmonologues, and a live cellist on stage\nproviding the soundtrack. The real\nstars of the show, however, are the\nfoley artists; clad in black, they take\nup the front of the stage, painstakingly\ncreating all of the sound e\ufb00ects in the\nplay. From the click of heels walking\nacross \ufb02oorboards, to the bubbling of\npans and rustling of cloth that form\nthe soundscape of Kristin\u2019s domestic\ndrudgery, the foley artists create all\nof the ambient sounds we can hear\nin the play. The result is breathtak-ing, but also makes it di\ufb03cult to know\nwhere to focus; should we be looking\nat the foley artists, or the actors, or\nthe screen? After leaving the theatre\nit is di\ufb03cult to tell if I\u2019ve missed any-thing; it is certainly a production that\nneeds to be seen twice.\nWith all of the technological wizardry going on, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if the performances are sub-par.\nThey are not. The actors, drafted over\nfrom the Berlin Schaub\u00fchne, are effortlessly in control of their perfor-mances. The nature of this production requires a high level of precision;\nany mistakes the actors make might\nlead to the cameras or sound being\nout of time.\nMitchell has said that past productions have had to be halted completely because of slip-ups. Control is\ntherefore of the utmost importance.\nWhile this lends the actors a quality\nthat some would describe as robotic,\nit perfectly re\ufb02ects the restrictive social values of the time and makes the\ninstances where the characters show\npure emotion even more shocking.\nJule B\u00f6we is on top form as Kristin,\ndisplaying a virtuosic ability to layer\nemotion upon emotion, with slight -almost invisible \u2013 movements betraying what she is really feeling. Wolfram\u2019s Fra\u00fclein is also sublime, \ufb02oating\naround the stage like a hollow shell,\ncreating a wonderful juxtaposition\nagainst Kristin\u2019s stoic character.\nAs with any playwright whose\nworks have entered into the literary\ncanon, directors who stray too far\nfrom the beaten path may be criticised for \u2018betraying the work\u2019s integrity\u2019. I am sure that there will be a\nnumber of critics who feel that Mitchell\u2019s take on this naturalistic classic is\ntoo robotic, too mechanical, to truly\nre\ufb02ect what Strindberg was trying to\nachieve. The script alone is radically\ndi\ufb00erent enough to give professors of\nScandinavian literature an aneurism.\nUnfortunately the show has now\n\ufb01nished its run. However, it is my\nopinion that Mitchell did not simply\nsucceed with this production, she\nreaches dizzying heights and shows\nwhat is possible on the stage. Fra\u00fclein Julie is balanced on a knife edge\nof timing and control but, by revealing the invisible art of theatrecraft to\nthe audience, Mitchell has created a\nproduction that is both magical and\ntechnical. A true modern classic.\nBreaking the backdrop\nFred Fyles Writer\nGoogle maps\nfilming becomes\nintrusive\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT\n31\nFRIDAY 10 MAY\nSport Editors: Oli Benton,\nMargot Pikovsky, Sorcha Cotter\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAfter a hard fought weekend of match-es, the Imperial Falcons rounded o\ufb00\ntheir season with an emphatic victory\nover the UEA Blue Sox, giving us a\nthird-place \ufb01nish in the BUBA Spring\nCup.\nThe Falcons\u2019 cup campaign got o\ufb00 to\na shaky start on the Saturday as club\npresident Dan \u201cWrong Gear!\u201d Harris\nstalled the minibus a grand total of\nfour times on the way to the ground.\nDespite some equally dodgy navigating from general manager Vincent Li,\nthe team got to Croydon in time for\nthe \ufb01rst match, with high hopes of a\nsuccessful tournament.\nImperial opened their campaign\nagainst UCL, in a game that was expected to be a relatively easy victory.\nThe game was tight during the \ufb01rst\ntwo innings, as pitcher Hajime Urata\nand the Imperial defence kept UCL\nfrom scoring. The deadlock was bro-ken, however, in the top of the fourth\ninning as a number of Imperial errors\nallowed UCL four runs. Fortunately,\nImperial managed to claw a couple\nback in the bottom of that inning\nagainst the pitching of UCL\u2019s 50-Year-Old Man.\nThanks to some excellent pitching\nby Hajime, UCL failed to score in their\n\ufb01nal inning, leaving us needing three\nruns to win the game. A few batters\nlater, the game was tied at 4-4, with two\nrunners on and one out, with rookie\nSimon Andersson stepping up to the\nplate. On the third pitch, Simon sent\nthe ball \ufb02ying towards right \ufb01eld; the\nImperial bench held its breath as the\nball hung in the air, only for it to come\ndown inches away from the \ufb01elder\u2019s\noutstretched arm. Sam O\u2019Mullane ran\nhome, giving Simon a walk-o\ufb00 hit, and\ngiving Imperial a tense 5-4 victory.\nOur next game, against the Southampton Mustangs, started in similar\nfashion, with neither team scoring in\nthe \ufb01rst two innings, thanks to some\ntight pitching, this time by Vincent.\nOnce again, however, Imperial\u2019s defence cracked in the third inning, leaving Southampton four runs up. The\nFalcons only scored two in the top of\nthe fourth inning, but since it was a\ntimed game, another inning would be\nplayed if we could end Southampton\u2019s\ninning in eight minutes. Fortunately,\nHajime returned to pitch a breathless\nfourth inning, retiring Southampton\nin six minutes to give Imperial a shot\nat an unlikely victory. It wasn\u2019t to be,\nhowever, as the Falcons managed only\none run in their \ufb01fth inning, giving\nSouthampton a 5-3 victory.\nThe Sunday began with our \ufb01nal\ngroup game against the (slightly hun-gover) Nottingham Thieves; the Imperial bench swiftly exhausted the\nsupply of jokes about stealing bases.\nOur defence made an excellent start,\nwhich continued as starting pitcher\nSidney Louzon didn\u2019t give up a single\nrun over the \ufb01rst three innings. Meanwhile, Imperial\u2019s o\ufb00ense racked up the\nruns, going into Nottingham\u2019s \ufb01nal innings 11-0 up. As Sidney tired, Nottingham began a late rally, but it wasn\u2019t\nenough as Julian Chiu struck out the\nlast of Nottingham\u2019s o\ufb00ense. The 11-6\nwin put Imperial through to the semi\ufb01nals, and another match against Nottingham.\nThe semi-\ufb01nal was much closer\nthan the group game, as Nottingham had mostly recovered from their\nhangovers and brought on their better\npitcher. The score crept up, however,\nand Imperial\u2019s third inning began with\nthe Falcons 4-2 down. Despite the \u201catbat from hell\u201d (during which Simon\npopped his shoulder and Julian pulled\nhis hamstring), we tacked on another\nrun, as Dan Harris came home in comedic fashion \u2013 Dan tried to slide into\nthe plate, tripped over, and then (liter-ally) crawled home as the opposition\ncatcher let the throw from 2nd base\nthrough his legs.\nPitcher Hajime Urata shut Nottingham out in the top of the fourth\ninning, leaving Imperial needing two\nruns to win. Despite what he claimed\nwas a \u201cpotentially career ending, crippling hamstring injury\u201d, Kevin McDonald brought Yutaro Jimbo home\nfor the \ufb01rst run, leaving Imperial with\none out and two men on base, looking\nsure of victory. The Falcons could not\ndrive their advantage home, however,\nmeaning a \ufb01fth inning would be re-quired. Unfortunately, during the top\nof the \ufb01fth, Nottingham hit their stride\nand hit four runs, leaving the Falcons\nwith a mountain to climb in the bottom of the innings. Imperial failed to\nscore as Nottingham ran out 9-5 win-ners, putting them through to the \ufb01nal\nagainst ULJS.\nImperial went into the \ufb01nal game of\nthe tournament against the UEA Blue\nSox, competing for third place with a\ndepleted line-up, as the injuries had\nImperial Falcons claw onto third place\nSports Writer\nChris Carter\nBaseball team put on impressive display, thankfully beating UCL\nCome and tell me no hot drinks\nin the computer room now\nstacked up over the course of the week-end. This was compounded when our\n\ufb01rst baseman left half way through the\n\ufb01rst inning to umpire the tournament\n\ufb01nal. Fortunately, however, the lack of\nfully-functional \ufb01elders proved not to\nbe a problem, as Imperial pitcher Yutaro struck out seven of the opposition\nbatters in the \ufb01rst three innings, while\nnot giving up a single hit. Meanwhile,\nImperial\u2019s o\ufb00ense slowly built up the\nscore, going up 4-0 after three innings.\nAs the sun came out during the\ntop of the fourth inning, Yutaro continued his attempt to pitch a perfect\ngame, and may have succeeded if not\nfor emergency catcher Vincent, who\nobstructed a batter, causing a balk\nand costing Yutaro his perfect game.\nImperial added more runs during the\nbottom of the inning, leaving UEA\nneeding 6 runs to make Imperial bat\nagain. Despite, some gallant o\ufb00ense,\nincluding a two-run home-run, Imperial \ufb01nished the game as 6-2 winners,\nsealing a third-place \ufb01nish in the tour-nament; congratulations go to ULJS\nfor a well-deserved victory in the \ufb01nal.\nThe game against UEA was a great\nend to a long season, in which we won\nsome, lost some and learnt the true\nmeaning of the word \u201ccold\u201d.

The aim was\nto launch two high altitude balloons\n(HABs) and several model rockets built\nover the course of the year.\nThe two HABs were the culmination\nof ICSEDS\u2019s very own space race, with\nteams Alpha and Omega competing to\ndesign and launch a HAB able to take\nphotographs of the curvature of the\nEarth for the lowest cost. Team Alpha\nchose to use a second hand HTC Desire smartphone, providing them with\na camera, GPS tracker, battery, and\nprocessor in one package. Meanwhile\nTeam Omega built their payload from\nscratch, using two Arduinos and a variety of sensors to track their balloon\u2019s location and altitude, and capture images.\nSadly, despite the wonderful weather\nand favourable wind conditions both\nteams lost the signals of their GPS\ntrackers, though another group of high\naltitude balloonists picked up one of the\nsignals during the ascent. They learnt\nthat they need to invest in more powerful ground tracking equipment and a\nbigger antenna. They are hoping someone will come across them before they\nget destroyed by the elements (they are\npredicted to have landed just east of Peterborough) and have started an online\ncampaign to raise awareness and the\nlikelihood of retrieval (details can be\nfound on their website and Twitter).\nAlongside these HAB launches, members were also able to launch their very\nown model rockets, and unlike with the\nHABs they had a 100% retrieval success rate! The most impressive of the\nrockets was that of Project Officer, TeeJay Taiwo, who was launching a rocket\njust under a meter long with a H125\nmotor (average thrust 125N compared\nto the 1N to 3N A-class starting motors\nthe other members had) in order to obtain his level 1 certification. ICSEDS\nhappily announced that he passed the\nassessment after an exemplary launch,\nand this will allow ICSEDS to launch\nhigh powered rockets under his supervision in the future.\nICSEDS said that they would like to\nthank the Imperial College Chemical\nEngineering Department, for donating\nthe helium for both teams; Steve Randall, for kindly offering his time and\nexpertise at the launch, and their Project Officer\u2019s family members for volunteering to drive the helium tanks to\nthe launch site.\nICSEDS is open to anyone with an interest in space. Current projects include\nhigh-powered model rocketry, high altitude ballooning, and design of a ramjet\nengine. ICSEDS offers the chance to\nlearn new skills working on hands-on\nprojects and to meet other space nuts/\nvaluable industry contacts. ICSEDS is a\nbranch of UKSEDS, and part of a global SEDS network that started at MIT\nin 1980 and features many prominent\nspace figures as alumni.\nFor more information on projects and\nmembership Google \u2018ICSEDS\u2019.\nAll photos: ICSEDS\n\n"

Paul Beaumont, Union President, sent a list of\nrequests to the College, which went to\nthe Management Board in March.\nThe North Acton campaign mustered large amounts of support from\nthe student body at Imperial College,\na body that has in the past been accused of not using their voice. A petition organized by the Union received\n709 signatures, and a separate petition\nfrom the Garden Hall Committee got\nto 1,461.\nUnion\u2019s Requests\nPaul\u2019s letter to the College comprised\nof \ufb01ve key requests to resolve the\ncomplaints of the student body. First\nand foremost of these was to push\nfor keeping Garden Hall, one of the\ncheapest and the most oversubscribed\nHall of Residence.\nAlongside this, Beaumont argued\nfor retaining Evelyn Gardens, a grouping of \ufb01ve halls at Evelyn Gardens,\nnear Gloucester Road. The halls in\nEvelyn Gardens are owned by the\nWellcome Trust, and are leased to the\nCollege, though this lease is expiring\nwithin the next few decades.\nIt was also of concern that the Accommodation Survey, held in 2011,\nmay contain \u201cdiscrepancies\u201d when\ncompared to the Accommodation\nStrategy. According to an article on\nthe Union\u2019s website (now unavail-able), data from the survey suggested\nstudent\u2019s want accommodation close\nto College, at a price similar to that\ncharged by Evelyn Gardens.\nBuilding on from this, Beaumont\nargued that the North Acton project\nshould have had proper consultation\nwith stakeholders before the plans\nwere approved.

This\nhas already been seen in Britain and\nPoland, with lung cancer leapfrogging\nbreast cancer as the main cause of female cancer death.\nThe surge is attributed towards the\nnumber of women who started smoking in the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s, say researchers from the University of Milan.\nThe Europe-wide study by Professor\nC.L. Vecchia reports that despite an\noverall decline in cancer deaths, mortality rates from lung cancer among\nwomen continues to rise across the\ncontinent, up seven percent to around\n82,000 since 2009.\nProfessor F.

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 10 MAY\n22\nLast month saw the fifth Polish\nShort Film Festival come to London,\nhaving made its journey around\nthe globe. We went on down to\nDalston (where else) to the cute little Rio Cinema (think Notting Hill\nCoronet, velveted squeaky chairs\ntype of place) to find out what exactly Polish short films consist of.\nAs we entered, we were given\na score card to pick the best film.\nThe winner would receive 10,000\nzloty \u2013 about \u00a32000. Handing\nout tiny amounts of power with\nthe ability to aid some stranger\u2019s\nfilm-making abilities may have\nalso been a nifty way of making us really think about what\nwe thought of each film and why.\nOut of the nine shown, my particular favourite was The Governance of Love. It opened up with a picture of a cat, which seemed to have\nbeen sketched in wax crayons by a\nchild and a blurry-voiced narrator\ndeclaring that he was a kitten. As the\nstory moved on, he seemed to jump\nbetween his imagination and reality,\nbetween different places and beings.\nAs audience members started\nlaughing at what seemed to be not\nvery funny scenes, it was clear that\nthe subtitles, though translating literal meaning, were not able to depict the tone of the piece. It was a\ngreat shame, as the film may have\nhad more of an impact had the native language been understood.\nAs the film unravelled, it was\nclear that they were not the ramblings of a child nor someone trying\nto be edgy. They were drawings and\nstories of a patient with a mental dis-order. His weird perspectives on life\nstruck up unpredicted connections\nwith the audience. It was a clever way\nof giving us access to a world which\nis sometimes sadly shunned away.\nOnly three films were live ac-tion. Philosophical narrated ani-mations, light-hearted and brightly coloured stop-frames to pop\nmusic, an eerie \u2018Grizzly Tales for\nGruesome Kids\u2019-esque black and\nblood red cartoon, and a rather\ndull compilation of scientific archive material formed the rest.\nOf the live action pieces, a particular favourite was The Guardians. A young officer must allow\nonly travellers with VISAs to pass a\nbarrier and continue their journey\ninto a misty forest. As he stamps\nthe papers of the travellers, he peers\nintently at their faces with a sadness he knows he should not show.\nAs a mother leaves her child and\nhusband behind, it becomes clear\nas to where the travellers are going.\nThe simplicity yet complexity of\nleaving loved ones behind appears.\nDespite dealing with a clich\u00e9\nsubject, The Guardians retained\nthe air of mystery, emotion it de-serves, yet had a explicit and tangible directness about it. It had more\nof a depth than All Souls\u2019 Day (girl\nShort Waves: Polish Short Film Festival\nLily Le Film Writer hunts down long lost father and discovers dead mother was not so perfect after all) and A Memory of Last\nSummer (girl bumps into lost love\nand they have sex in parents\u2019 car).\nThough the latter two played on\nthemes not unknown in contemporary cinema, they were nonetheless beautifully filmed with quirky\ntones unique to each of them. This\nwas something which definitely\nbelonged in each piece of the fes-tival. I couldn\u2019t help but imagine\nwhat would happen had the films\nextended to a couple more hours.\nReaders can find The Governance of\nLove at: http://vimeo.com/60640887\n\n"

In this annual hunt\nfor the nation\u2019s best science commu-nicators, each contestant has exactly\nthree minutes to impress a panel of\nthree judges. They may explain any\nscienti\ufb01c concept but cannot use assisting slides or large props. This year\nthe standard was very high and Leon\ndidn\u2019t expect to beat the other ten\n\ufb01nalists. However he won over the\njudges with his truly genuine enthusiasm when describing the landing of\nNASA\u2019s Mars Curiosity Rover.\nLeon\u2019s early interest in rockets and\nengines led him to study Aeronautical\nEngineering. His PhD is on hyperson-ics, which involves studying how \ufb02uids (including air) travel over objects\nat high speed. He has use of a wind\ngun on campus which \ufb01res air at an incredible 1.5km/s albeit for only 6mil-liseconds at a time.\nBut Leon hasn\u2019t always been a sci-entist; he spent an unful\ufb01lling year in\n\ufb01nancial services and has three suits\nto show for it. However it was in an\norange skull-and-cross-bones t-shirt,\njeans and \u201cskaties\u201d, that he triumphed\nin London last month.\nImperial student wins national\nscience communication competion\nAs an Outreach Postgraduate Ambassador for Imperial College, Leon\nhas extensive science communication\nexperience garnered from a diverse\nrange of presentations and demonstrations (in one such demo he set\nhis hand on \ufb01re which was exciting\nbut something he wouldn\u2019t want to\nrepeat). He believes that you must always explain science to the best of your\nknowledge. You must always think of\nyour audience. And if you reach the\nedge of your understanding, admit it.\nHe also stresses that science communication isn\u2019t just about the big stage.\nIt\u2019s about talking to friends and family\nabout what you do. It\u2019s about explaining climate change to the person in the\nstreet. But wanting to do it and taking\nthe time and e\ufb00ort to do it well-- that\u2019s\nwhat makes the di\ufb00erence.\nFor more information visit http://\nfamelab.org/\nStephanie Walton Reporter\nRoyal Society Fellowships for\nthree Imperial scientists\nTim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief\nThree Imperial scientists have been\ngranted Fellowship of the Royal Society.

If a bunch of lost tourists ask me for directions to Earl\u2019s Court\nstation, they\u2019ll end up outside the local\nhomeless shelter instead. Worst of all,\nI\u2019m not going to hold the door open for\nanyone. I\u2019m fed up with this world, and\nI\u2019m just going to let it burn for a bit,\nfall over, and then blow up in your face,\nlike a poorly made \ufb01rework.\nOn one side, I\u2019m stuck with all the\nimbeciles that don\u2019t know the di\ufb00erence between muscovado and dem-erara sugar, and on the other side,\nthere\u2019s the intellectual pricks who\u2019ll\nlecture you on the correct pronunciation and etymology of \u2018eat a bag of\ndicks\u2019.\nEveryone you are going to meet at\nyour workplace is somewhere between these two stereotypes, and\nyou can rest assured that they don\u2019t\ncare about you or your feelings. They\nprobably don\u2019t even remember you\nwere there when they pushed straight\nthrough you, screaming into a bling-tastic, plastic-studded phone to one of\ntheir partners about their latest STD.\nSo, I\u2019m here to tell you to give up all\nsemblance of being a reasonable per-son, and instead be the greedy, self-centered person you see on the street,\nand you\u2019ll feel a better human for it.\nDo you often feel like a pillar of sup-port, ready to be leant upon and shat\non by pigeons, within a moment\u2019s\nnotice? I\u2019m sorry, but if your friends\naren\u2019t going to keep their business\nto themselves when they\u2019re thinking\nabout changing star signs, you need\nto re-evaluate your friend catchment\narea. They\u2019re the kind of people who\nInstagram their daily bowel move-ments. Or Vine it, if they\u2019re feeling\nedgy. Instead, tell them to suck it up,\nand deal with it in their own way \u2013\neveryone has their own problems, so\npiling theirs onto you isn\u2019t the act of\na friend (it\u2019s a wonder Hangman has\nno friends eh? His Apprentice audition\ntape was rejected for being \u201ctoo much\nof an arsehole\u201d). It\u2019s the act of someone\nwho secretly wants you to lace their\nfood with laxatives, but is too afraid to\nask. It\u2019s a fetish thing, and they don\u2019t\nthink you\u2019ll understand.\nIf you start making a name for yourself as that \u2018always-happy-to-help\u2019 or\napproachable kind of lass/lassette,\nyou\u2019re in for a bad time. People start to\ndepend on you. They need someone to\ncreate a croque en bouche for the bake\nsale to supplement your bosses bo-nuses? You. They\u2019re looking for a \ufb01nal\nteam mate to join them in the Crystal\nMaze? You. (It\u2019s a Tudor-Pole series,\nnot an O\u2019Brian). They need someone\nto write a glowing bureaucratic report\nfor a colleague, whilst you\u2019re truly\nwondering how they still have the job?\nYou. Life is a heck of a lot easier when\nno-one has any expectations of you.\nIf you appear to be unreliable, then\nyou won\u2019t be the default selection for\nvomit-cleanup at the departmental\ncocktail party, and you can instead get\nas wasted as you want, and make even\nmore mess. You deserve it.\nUltimately, there\u2019s nothing I like\nmore than just sitting around and exerting the least physical e\ufb00ort for the\nlargest gain in fuck-all. I\u2019m not going to go out of my way, put on some\nclothes and actually leave the Felix of\ufb01ce to volunteer at a soup kitchen. It\ndoesn\u2019t take more than one person to\nuse a tin opener and microwave some\nbowls of soup. Don\u2019t volunteer for extra work, and you\u2019ll be \ufb01ne.\nNo-one is going to be out to help\nyou, so you need to do everything for\nyourself. Buy and suck your way to\nthe top. You can\u2019t trust anyone else to\nhide the bodies, or to clean up your\nmess. I\u2019m not saying that you should\ngo around pushing your annoying\ncolleagues onto the tracks infront of\nthe next Upminster-bound train, but\nrather you don\u2019t help them up, once\nthey\u2019ve... uh... tripped. Pretend to be\ntraumatised and you can get their job,\nextra holiday, pity sex, and most im-portantly, a better desk.\nYou\u2019re going to work there anyway, so you might as well get a head start\nBizet: \u201cCarmen\u201d\n\u201cComme ils vont du fer de leur\nlance, harceler le flanc des\ntaureaux!\n(How they\u2019re going to, with the tip\nof their lances, pierce the flank of\nthe bulls!\u201d)\nLanguage used to be so beautiful.\nNowadays this would say \u201cHow\nthey\u2019re going to, with the tip of their\npenis,havesexwithsomeone\u2019sarse\u201d.\nWould make Carmen a bit more entertaining though.

Their response covered\nthe majority of the points from.\nThe \ufb01rst part of their report covered\ntheir current view. They were keen to\nstress the increase in bed spaces at the\nnewly refurbished Wilson House, due\nto open ready for the next cohort of\nstudents, as well as an upcoming increase in bed spaces at Beit Hall, following the loss of East Basement.\nOne signi\ufb01cant point was noting\nthat Garden Hall will close next year,\ndue to \u201cneeding refurbishment\u201d. It is\nunclear as to whether College intend\nto refurbish the property over the\nnext year, however it has disappeared\nfrom the Accommodation website. It\u2019s\nsister hall, Weeks, remains, alongside\nthe temporary Paragon and Xenia.\nAdditionally, it was noted that\nEvelyn Gardens would require some\nwork in the near future. Fisher Hall\nhas been mooted for closure in the\npast due to the state of the premises,\nthough the impending expiry of the\nlease caused College to \ufb01le a joint\nplanning application with the Wellcome Trust to convert it into a nursing home.\nCollege has stressed that they will\ncontinue to look for cheap, close ac-commodation. As part of this, they\nare considering the future of Garden\nHall, Evelyn Gardens, and Pembridge\nHall, which hasn\u2019t been mentioned\nbefore. Pembridge currently houses\n96 students, which College feel is too\nsmall for the medium term, and the\nhall may require extension.\nRegarding Evelyn Gardens and Garden Hall, College stated that structural inspection is needed of the halls,\nwhich is intended to take place following the end of the academic year.\nA consultation has been promised on\nthe \ufb01ndings by the end of 2013. Additionally, it is likely that some potential\nproposals cannot be circulated with\nthe student body due to commercial\nsensitivity, however Beaumont noted\nthat this likely means that Evelyn Gardens lease will be looked into.\nFinally, it was noted that College do\nnot make a pro\ufb01t from accommodation charges, pointing out the cost of\nbuilding maintenance and property\nvalues.\nThe way forward with North\nActon\nBeing the item of complaint with the\nstudent body, a speci\ufb01c mention was\nmade of the North Acton develop-ment. College have promised that\nwardening provision will be made at\nthe new hall, in addition to the receptionist service. It was not mentioned,\nhowever, how many wardens there\nwould be in the new hall.\nAdditionally, the development\nwill go ahead, due to a contract being signed with property developer\nBerkeley First. However, consultations will be undertaken with stu-dents, wardens, and other members\nof College sta\ufb00 to ensure that the\ncorrect steps are made on the way\nforward.\nUnion Council step in\nIn a busy meeting of the Union Council on April 30th, one of the main\nagenda items was a response to the\nCollege\u2019s document. In the paper, also\nby Beaumont, he listed a number of\npoints for the Council to improve.\nThey included:\n\u2022 The Union should contribute positively to the new halls, regardless of\nthe outcome to Evelyn Gardens and\nGarden Hall, and agree a consultation\nprocedure with the College as part of\nthis.\n\u2022 That College should clarify what\nthey mean by being \u2018committed to\nproviding a range of accommodation\noptions at a variety of prices, which\nre\ufb02ect quality and location\u2019.\n\u2022 That the Union President should\nbe included in commercially sensitive\nnegotiations.\n\u2022 And that College should clarify the\nrefurbishment process of Garden Hall,\nand what consultations may be part of\nthis.\nAt the meeting, Beaumont expressed how unusual it was to get a\nresponse from College\u2019s Management\nBoard, and how much of a good sign\nthis was. In addition to this, it was\ncon\ufb01rmed that Simon Harding-Roots,\nChief Operations O\ufb03cer of Imperial\nCollege, was currently engaging with\nthe Wellcome Trust to investigate the\nlease issue of Evelyn Gardens,\nFinally, in what appears to be the\nbeginnings of a formal consultation\nprocess, a new working group has\nbeen established by College to establish what use is made of space within\nthe new Acton development, amongst\nother matters. This working group\nconsists of people including sabbatical o\ufb03cers, members of College, and\na cross section of students at Imperial\nCollege, covering those from all backgrounds and natures. The fact that\nsuch a working group exists is of huge\npromise to many at Imperial, possibly\nshowing a gradual move towards a full\nconsultation.\nEngaging the Wellcome Trust over the Evelyn Gardens lease\ncontinued from the front page\n>>\nArtist\u2019s\nimpression of the\nnew halls at night\nBerkeley First\nEditorial: page 2\n>>\nHall changes\ntimeline\n18 February\nCollege Announce publicly\nthe purchase of the land\n19 February\nUnion launch their campaign\nagainst the changes\n22 February\nCollege put Q &A with\nSimon Harding-Roots and\nDebra Humphris online\n23 February\nUnion sends list of five\nrequests to College\n26 February\nUnion launches show of\nsupport campaign\n7 March\nStudents protest Garden\nHall closure after creating\npetition\n20 March\nManagement Board meet\nand discuss the situation\n22 March\nCollege responds to Union\u2019s\nfive requests\n30 April\nUnion Council discuss and\nvote on response to College\u2019s\nresponse\n\n"
