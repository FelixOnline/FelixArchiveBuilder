Copy date June 6th APATHy Cm KILL.' by noted a pathologist. Dr. L.Y. Knott (author of\n\"Apathy\u2014Who Cares?\")\nApathy is on the increase. To talk of an epidemic is. no exaggeration; the disease is now nearly as common as measles. It is an unpleasant subject, I agree, but the facts will not go away if we ignore\nthem. Thousands of people were treated last year\nin Britain alone; probably millions of others went\nuntreated and even undiagnosed. For that is one of\nthe tragedies of apathy: many sufferers do not even\nrealise they are ill \u2014 until too late.\nThe first symptoms \u2014 boredom and irritation\nwith the surroundings \u2014 are seldom recognised as danger signs and may even go unnoticed. Then\ncomes the second, or latent, phase Where, although\ndissatisfaction has increased, the victim has lost the\npersist for months of years, with the sufferer completely unaware that he is in any way unhealthy.\n(Typical symptoms at this stage include eating fish\nfingers, subscribing to \" Reader's Digest\", and many others which only a specialist would recognise). Modern treatment is simple, but without it he\nendangers not only himself but also risks infecting\nanyone with whom he has contact. And without\ntreatment, the final collapse is tragic, swift and in\nevi table \u2014 paralysis of varying degree, loss of touch\nwith surroundings, mental decay and in many cases,\ndeath. For this medical science has no cure.\nApathy is not restricted to the young. It can strike\nanyone: the respected man in a high position, or\neven, tragically, the faithful wife who has never\nonce broken her marriage vows. But statistics show that young people, and particularly students, run\ndesire to do anything about it. This condition may the highest risk of all. Are you one of them?\nThe test below has been scientifically designed\nto measure your apathy rating. It is intended only as\na guide; if the results suggest you are apathetic you should see a specialist for further tests. ( All treatment is strictly confidential).

Is y mpa this e with\nGordon and Pete and\nhope to be able to work\nwith them towards the\nbetterment of I.C. Union\nnext year.\nThank you,\nPAUL WADWORTH\nP.S. Starting my job\nearly don't forget the\nAnnual General Imperial\nCollege Union meeting\nto be held at 1.00 p.m. in the Great Hall on\nThursday. June 7th. Dear OH, On discussion with Paul Jo witt I have dec i ded this term there is no\npoint in my coming to\nRoom at the Top at my usual time (Tuesdays\nand Fridays 1.30-2.30)\nas this no longer coincides with students'\nhj nch time. I have therefore arranged that I can be present between\n|12.30 and1.30 on both\nthose days and would tike you to make a com ment to this effect in Felix as soon as possible.\nPerhaps if you would just put a little blurb\nwhich says: \" . . . Bonney\nHartnett, the Student\nCounsellor, will be available in the Welfare Corner of Room at the Top between 1 2 . 3 0 and1.30 p.m. on Tuesdays and Fridays. This is a slight\nchange in time from last\nterm in order to coin-cide with students' lunch\nhour. As it has been very\nquiet up till now she will\nwelcome students to\ncome for advice/information/ just for a chat\". Please feel free to\nplay around with this as\nyou want however, so\nlong as the basic inform ation is there.\nRegards,\nBONNEY HARTNETT.\nSir,\nI'm pleased to read\nthat Martin Doughty has\nhad the sense to start\nreading the word of\nGOD. Perhaps he will\ncome to know GOD in a personal way through\nthe person of Jesus\nChrist. Or perhaps it's su posed to be funny, in\nwhich case he must\nthink Christianity is a lot\nof superstitious non-sense. Well. I put this\nquestion to him, to Jock\nVeall, and any other\nnon - Christian: Jesus\nChrist made some fantastic claims. He said\nhe was GOD and that if\npeople believed in Him,\nthey could have eternal\nlife. He proved His\nclaims by doing miracles\nand most important, by\nbeing raised from the\ndead as He had predict-ed.\nIf people really need\nto be convinced of the\ndeity of Jesus, all they\nneed to do is to look at\nthe evidence for the\nresurrection (try \"Who\nMoved the Stone'' by\nFrank Morison, who was\nan atheist until he tried\nto write a book disproving the resurrection j and they will have all the\nproof that they require.\nIf they then continue TO\ndeny Christ, fine, I hope\nyou enjoy it in Hell (but\nof course you can't believe in that).\nBut if you do believe\nChrist's claims to be\ntrue, the way to claim\nyour eternal life is to invite Jesus into your life\n(Revelation 3:20) to forgive your sins (which\nwould otherwise eternally separate you from\nGOD) and to take control of your life. If you\ndo this, I 'll see you in\nHeaven, I know you'll\nenjoy it. GOD will reveal\nHis plan for your life\nand fill you with the\nHoly Spirit to enable you\nto do all the things He\nwants you to (the most\nimportant of which is tell\nothers about Christ).\nThe third possibility\nis that you will continue\nto deny Christ without\nlooking at the evidence.\nThis college is supposed\nto be made up of scientists, who work on facts.\nI could say that the\nworld is square and flat,\nbut we all know that\nisn't true because of the\nfacts, to which I reply.\n\"But I haven't looked at\nthe facts!\" Similarly it is\nfoolish to deny Christ\nwithout investigating the\nfacts.\nI hope everyone who\nreads this looks at the\nfacts and makes a decision one way or the\nother. If you have any\nquestions, I'm sure any\nChristian will be only too\npleased to answer them,\nor come and see me per-son ally. Remember John 3:16,\nRomans 6:23 and 3:23,\nJohn 14:6 and Ephesians 2:8, 9.\nI and my brothers and\nsisters in Christ are\npraying for you all.\nDIGBY L. JAMES,\nChemistry 2.\nP.S. This letter refers\nto you too, Oily.\nSir,\nInteresting to see the\nletter in last week's Felix about the POPULATION DAY demonstrations held on Saturday, May 12. The Daily\nExpress editorial on the\nfollowing Monday said\nthe first thing we should\ndo is to ban im migr a tion. Well, why didn't we think of that? The\nobvious solution to stabilise the World population. The Express, pre-sum ably, would want to\nkeep the Africans in\nAfrica to work for British industry below the\npoverty line. The Guardian, bless it, in its\nleader the following day,\nequated the Africans'\nstarvation wages with\nDuncan Sandys \u00a350,000\nfrom Lohnro for his consultancy on African\naffairs.\nThe Guardian's headline when the Lohnro\nstory broke:\u2014 \"Lohnro\npaid Duncan Sandys\n\u00a3130,000\" (in compensation tax-free by way of\nthe Cayman Islands)\nwas matched by the\nTelegraph's the same\nday \"Duncan Sandys\npaid back \u00a344,000\"\n(They're really into ex-colonial secretaries) and\nPrivate Eye's: \u2014\"Gnomhro paid Mr. Sunken\nGlandys \u00a32 million.\"\nIncidentally the Express's sister paper, the\nEvening Standard, was\nat it again. Their headline of: \"Handcuffed\nHell's Angel found in\nThames\" turned out to\nbe a30 year old meat\nporter with a tattoo on\nhis arm wearing a leather jacket and a decorative bracelet.\nYours in Christ-knows\nwhere,\nMARTIN DOUGHTY\nMartin Doughty goes\nON SAFARI\n. . . to Norfolk\nI'm currently staying bed and breakfast in a little village pub on the North Norfolk coast courtesy of\nan MSc project. The bed very satis-f ying; the breakfast gargantuan and completely disrupting my nutritional\nhabits.\nI must be on one of the only MSc projects when you send postcards\nhome. \" Weather great\",\" Wish you were here\", \" Bet you wish you were here.\" All is not roses, though. The sampling equipment, having previously functioned better than the wildest dreams had anticipated, emerged\nfrom 5 0 metres down a6 inch bore-'\nhole (note the clever use of units)\nminus its all too important excretory\nappendage. Following close on the\npur chao ing of \u00a33 worth of clothesline and\"< ts subsequent measuring off\nin metre lengths, and its subsequent\ngross entanglement, this was no\nmorale booster.\nBut the local environment does not\nlet the spirits sag.I dashed back from\nNorwich last night thinking I might\nbe locked out to arrive at half past\nmidnight with the pub still full of\nrosy faces and thundering out early\nsixties-Irish ballads (which is a disadvantage admitted). Not, alas, that\nevery village pub here is such a hive\nof activity into the early hours or, in deed, at all. Old acquaintances, Wat ney s, who seem to have an almost\ntotal monopoly of the houses, have\nbeen closing them down in the\nsmaller villages where the profits\nwere a little too modest to avoid the\naccountant's pruning shears. (What\nwas that about Watney Mann's trading\nfigures for last year?) And more than\njust pulling out, they let the licence\nlapse so the village ceases to have a pub at all. It increases the account-ant's viability for the one in the next\nvillage.\nRural public transport suffers a concurrent and misguided decline\nwhen it ought to be augmented to\nfunction as a social service. The old folk, bewildered, are left stranded in\ntheir own homes to finish their days.\n(Remember the Man Alive documentary \" What' s happening down at the\nlocal\" a while back with the old men\nin tears?) The young leave. The community is destroyed.\nEven so, the predominance of regulars in the remaining pubs has retained fairly modest prices with\" Norwich\" bitter at 1 3 pa pint in\ndeference to London Wat ney s at\n2 0 p+ and the Norwich brewer could well teach the head brewer something\nabout taste buds. This area is encouraging in an-;\nother, more important way. It has\nbeen just a little bit too inaccessible\nto the capital to come under very\nclose scrutiny from the property\nspeculators. There are, though, dismal signs that second homes are\ncreeping in which will inevitably destroy its unique character if they bec o mean established feature. All of\nwhich is a salutary reminder that the\nmodern social vandal, the man of\nproperty, is also still a man of action,\nalbeit destruction. The cities, with the recent Netting Hill siege, the\nCharing Cross Road flats with West minster's ridiculous reference to \" decanting\" the residents (as opposed\nto evicting, whatever is the differ-en ce) and the general concern for\ncity centre communities being currently expressed in the media, need\nno reminder. The villages of North\nNorfolk probably do. Social irresponsibility of spec ul a tors, Watneys, Traffic engineers and the like in such circumstances undoubtedly leads to the destruction of\ncommunities and local character and personality. What must be remembered, however, is that there is no\ncommon, conscious conspiracy to\npropagate this destruction. Many socially retrograde policies carried\nout at national and local level are(\noften heralded as part of some giant\nconspiracy. Most are not and for that\nvery reason are more difficult to\ncounter since they do not have a common purpose although usually a common motivation \u2014 greed and sel t fish ness \u2014 and a common, and de-pressing, result.\nWell, I hope the journey back to\nbig L is as good as the one out. As anyone who knows me will tell, I'm really into trains and the company\nwas excellent on this one, too. It's nice to meet up with people you've\nonly ever known at a curious distance.\nAnd as those who know me will also\ntell, I have this disconcerting habit of\nmeeting up with some very strange\npeople on trains (cont. page 9 4 ) .\nMARTIN DOUGHTY "

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX22 nd May,1973 IMPERIAL COLLEGE INVESTMENTS\nIN SOUTH AFRICA\nFELIX reveals all Some weeks ago a FELIX reporter asked the College for\na list of their investments in connection with a joint article\nwith other student newspapers on University of London\ninvestments in South Africa. They refused to co-operate.\nNow FELIX has unearthed the 1971 data. We wonder how\nmuch it has changed..\nOwing to a certain\ndegree of reticence on\nbehalf of the College\nAuthorities to reveal\ntheir investments, FELIX\nhas unearthed the in vestments that IC had in August 1971 in various firms and comp an ies. FELIX does not know\nhow much money was involved with each firm\nnor does it know whether the stocks and shares are still held in\nany of these companies:\nthese, FELIX feels are\nquestions which the College should answer, as it involves the lives and welfare of many work-ers, black and white, as\nwell as the consciences\nof students, staff and all\nthose employed at IC.\nOut of the list of 5 9\ncompanies, we have\nchosen the ones which have figured in the news\nlately, for one brand of\ninfamy or another, particularly those in South Africa. Top of the list of the\nAnti Apartheid 'slave\nlabour' list employers\ncomes British Leyland\nwhich pays its semiskilled and unskilled\nAfrican employees an\naverage wage of \u00a37 per\nweek. This firm has also\ncreated redundancies in\nits British factories over\nthe last twelve months.\nDespite the self-evident\nprofit making opportunities of operating in\nSouth Africa, British\nLeyland failed to make\nthe fat profits which the\nother firms have made\nthere.\nBarclays Bank who pay their African workers \u00a347 per month com pared to \u00a3210 for\nwhites, sparked off a student drive to change\ntheir accounts to other\nbanks, owing to their\nextremely low African/ white employee ratio. A spokesman for Barclays\nspeaking on a television\nprogramme said that\nthis low ratio was explained by the apartheid\nlaws of the Vorster Government. Though Barc lays' ratio is unusually\nlow, even for banks,\nthere is no doubt that it\nis only the repressive\nmeasures of the Vorster\nregime, for example that\nthe Africans are not\nallowed to form unions,\nthat enable firms like\nBarclays to operate\nthere under a 'clear'\nconscience.\nDistillers Ltd. need\nno introduction for their\noutstanding work in\nmaiming children with\nthalidomide in the name\nof profits, and it is/was\nthese profits that enable\nthis college to wax fat.\nDelta Metal Co. pay\nstarvation wages in\nSouth Africa, have recently sacked workers\nin this country and have\njust paid \u00a3125,000 for\nthe Jo burg factory of\nDorm ann Electrical\nSales, and the profits\nroll back to IC I Guest, Keen and Nettlefold, who created a stir during the Wilson wage freeze by slipping\na30 per cent wage rise\nfor their chairman\nthrough the board of\ndirectors, pay their South\nAfrican workers \u00a35.50\np.w., and have recently\nsacked workers in this\ncountry.\nICI pay their African\nworkers \u00a38.30 p.w., have recently sacked\nworkers in this country\nand have just built a new plant in South\nAfrica. Imperial Tobacco Ltd. made a record \u00a3178m. last year through the\npurvey ance of carcinogens and hope to make more this year. What' s good for them is good for us remember! IC also\nhad investments in\nBritish American Tobacco Ltd. in 1 9 7 1 .\nUnilever, infamous\nexploiter of West and East African labour are\nwell-known to the Monopolies Commission In\nthis country. Although\nthey don't have quite a monopoly on margarine\nhere, they do produce\n8 0 per cent of what is\nsold, though under six\ndifferent brand names,\nand the profits all go back to Unilever, of\ncourse!\nFELIX doesn't have a copy of the Anti-Apartheid blacklist, it has\nhad to rely on its collective memory and back\ncopies of the Guardian\nfor an analysis of what\nthe firms IC invested in, in 1 9 7 1 , are doing today\nin South Africa and else-where. People are we l come to see the full list\nin the FELIX office and ponder on the morality\nof using equipment paid\nfor out of starving Africans. We wonder what\ninvestments IC has today and out of what\ndubious practices the\nprofits for this college\ncome \"The Broadsheet they\nwouldn't let\nYes, there WAS a Broadsheet out last\nThursday, it was what\nyou might call a limited\nedition, since 2 0 copies\nonly is pretty limited.\nWhen I left the RSC U office Wednesday night\n(at 1 1 . 3 0 p.m.) there\nwere 4 0 0 copies of this\nterm's bumper 2 0 page\nedition neatly sorted out\ninto piles for each year\nand department, I took\n20 home with ime. But when I returned at 9 . 0 0\na.m. the following morning there they were \u2014\ngone! \" Who could have\ndone this foul deed?\" you're probably asking\nyourself, well let's consider the possibilities.\nPerhaps the most obvious initial answer is to\nsay they must have been\nstolen by mines or\nguilds as part of the\n'mascot ry' raids that\nhave become quite frequent this past (aca-demi c) year. Question\n\u2014 but can guilds or\nmines get into the RSC U office without a key?\nAnswer \u2014 Perhaps. However had a raiding party\nfrom either of these 2\ncolleges removed the\nBroadsheets then why weren't they tempted to\nhelp themselves to any\nof the NUMEROUS signs currently in the\noffice? And why haven't we heard ANYTHING since?\nThis leads us onto\nthe second inevitable\nconclusion, that someone with a key (there are\nabout a dozen) stole\nthem either late Wednesday night, or early\nThursday morning. What\npossible motive could such a person have?\nWell perhaps this can be answered if I explain\nthe general format and contents that this edi tion of Broadsheet had. you see\nSome time ago I 'dis-guise d' the cover to look\nlike a Rag Mag and this\nidea was very popular\nwith most people and that particular edition\nsold well. So when planning what to do in my LAST Broadsheet I thought I'd re-employ\nthe same basic idea but take it a stage further. So I designed the front page\nto look like a typical\n\" Men' si Magazine\" and called it \" Pent sheet,\" this was coupled with a full frontal pin-up and\" spot the nipple\" contest on pages 1 0 - 1 1 .\nThere was a lot of protest at first to this idea.\nWhich resulted in one\nphoto being censored,\nbut over 9 0 per cent\nwas finally passed. At the beginning of this\nterm I was given a series\nof profiles on the R CSU officers, written by someone who wishes to\nremain anonymous and who called himself\n\" Scar a manga.\" These\nprofiles were non-com-pli ment ary in the main but quite factual and in\nfact I offered in form amati on about people and events to the author in\norder to get him to alter\nparts of the profiles I thought were unnecessarily nasty. This he did and with further editing\nof some profiles they\nwent into Broadsheet\n(Pentsheet) last week.\nHowever it seems some people took severe personal offence at either\ntheir nick-name (which\nnearly everyone was blessed with) or description and this just\nMAY have provided the\nmotive for someone to\nprevent this edition being sold by stealing it\nall. If persons in the\nposition of \" an officer of\nthe union\" cannot take\ncriticism of themselves\nthen- they are in a rather poor state. It\nwas the belief that such\ncomments would be ig-no red, or laughed off\netc. that persuaded me to include the \" Scar a manga\" columns in this\nBroadsheet. Also inside\nit were full reports on\nhow R.C.S. won the\nSparke's cup, our Great\nCarton Race team's efforts, the amusing\" minutes of an l. C.U. Union meeting 1 9 8 4 , \"\nA.G.M. and initiations\nreports, a400 square\n99\nprize crossword and an\nexcellent article entitled\n\"Impure Maths,\"\" Once upon a time (Yt) pretty\nlittle Polly Nominal was strolling across a field of\nvectors when she came to the edge of a singularly large matrix. Polly\nhad changed her variables that morning and was feeling particularly\nbadly behaved\nCurly was a Heavy side operator. She was integrated by parts . . . etc.\" So there you have it, 2 0\npages of perhaps the\nmost controversial\nBroadsheet ever, 2 0\npages which has been\nwell received, liked and talked about by the few\nto have seen them. But because of the actions\nof an exceedingly chi l dish individual or group,\nall the time, effort and money put into this\nbumper edition will be\nwasted, unless we can retrieve the missing400 VERY soon. To those who spent a lot of time writing, typing and helping out in many\nways I can only say Iam very sorry and disappointed that your\nwork has been sabotaged. Naturally I would like\nthere to be a Broadsheet\nout this term and so\nanyone with information\nabout the possible\nwhereabouts of the 4 0 0\ncopies is asked to contact me personally or\nvia Physics letter rack.\nIt would be a shame to\nlet the actions of a few\nspoil the enjoyment of\nthe many who looked\nforward to getting their\ncopy last week, especially after we even went\nto the trouble of producing 5 0 copies devoid of\nnudes, at the wishes of\nMaurice Maloney, for\nsale to Chemistry II. It\nwould seem that freed om of the press and free speech are being\nphysically attacked at\nI.C., well in R.C.S. at\nleast.\nRon Appleby\n(Broadsheet editor)\n(But not for much longer)\n\n"

The undergraduate\ngrant will thus be \u00a3520 in London, Oxford\nand Cambridge, \u00a3485 elsewhere. (\u00a3480 and\n\u00a3445 respectively this year). The cost to the\nExchequer will be \u00a310 million.\nThis is the first time\nthat a government has\nawarded an increase\nin grant other than at\nthe triennial review\n(the next is next year).\nInstant reaction\nfrom NUS and IC\nUnion was un favour able. The increases\nwere called paltry by\ncomparison with the\n\u00a3100 increase de-mande d. It was pointed out that 65pa week would go nowhere near matching\nthe price rises caused\nby this year'sinf la tion, let alone next\nyear's. The NUS was especially angry that\nthe increases were\nonly for students on\nmandatory grants, i.e. those at universities\nand polytechnics.\nStudents on discretionary awards \u2014\nthose at universities\nFurther Education,\nTechs., etc.\u2014received\nno satisfaction- The\nNUS had demanded\nabolition of these\nlower discretionary\nawards, and Easter\nConference at Exeter\npledged the Executive\nto refuse any increase\nin mandatory grants\nuntil discretionary\nawards are abolished.\nThe NUS thus finds\nitself in a difficult\nposition over this\ngrants increase, and\nthe position will have\nto be worked out at\nthe Extraordinary\nConference to be held\nhere at Imperial College on June 8th or\n9th. Felix will bring\nyou the first \u2014 and\npossibly only \u2014 student press report in\nour last issue of term,\non June 12th.( Most\nstudent papers have\nalready finished publishing for the year).\nRefectory Committee\nasked for 71 rise\nIN THIS\nISSUE\n*\n\"Felix\"\nEditor\nthreatened\nwith\ncastration\npage 2\n*\nFelix reveals\nIC\ninvestments\nin South\nAfrica\npage 4\nNo God\nletters\nanywhere\nMr. Mooney asked the Refectory Committee to approve a1\\ per\ncent increase in meal prices at its meeting on Thursday morning.\nThis was one of several\npossibilities discussed by\nthe committee in order to\navoid an estimated \u00a335,100 deficit in catering\nover the next academic\nyear. The Universities\nGrants Committee, which\nadministers all the funds\nfor universities and colleges in the United King dom requires college refectories to break even,\nand will not give Sibsidies.\nA1\\ per cent increase\nin price given that consumption remains constant and using bar and\ncellar profits to reduce\nthe loss, should let the refectories scrape home next\nJune with a slight surplus.\nOne alternative that\nwas put by the Union representatives on the com-mitte ee was that students\nshould accept a2\\ per\ncent increase (equivalent\nto the rise just given in\nthe grant) and asked the\nGoverning Body for a subsidy to cover the rest\nof the deficit, or, alternatively that the Governing\nBody should make good\nthe entire deficit.\n\\\nThese suggestions were\nput to last Thursday's Union Meeting by the\nUnion representatives on\nthe committee, John Lane,\nGordon Jackson and Rob Armitage. The meeting\ndecided to opt for the\nlatter preference, i.e. no\nincreases.\nThis was put to the ad-jour ned* Refectory Committee meeting on Friday\nmorning, and other members \" seemed sympathetic to our views,\"\nJohn Lane told Felix.\nThe Committee has\nnow put in a submission\nto the Governing Body on the matter. They have\nto approve any price in creases, and in usual practice they \"rubber-stamp\"\nthe Refectory Committee\ndecisions.\nThis time five alternative courses have been\nput to them, ranging from\nthe no increase/100 per\ncent subsidy demanded\nby the Union, through\nthe compromise ''A per\ncent to the full 71 per\ncent increase. Developments are awaited, and\nUnion representatives\nseem reasonably hopeful\nof their demand being\ngiven a fair reception.\n\n"

You may wonder what it's all about? It is for a course sponsored by\nthe Unification Church to take place in July-August.\nCost of the course will be \u00a310 plus whatever spending\nmoney you want.\nWhy are we sponsoring this? We believe all people\nmust, and will only come together in a spirit of co-oper-ation through a clear understanding of the Spiritual\nnature of man. To explain what is meant by this we\ncan take an example from the world of medicine.\nWestern medicine has tended to concentrate on diseases\nand concern itself with the treatment of specific diseases\nand specific areas of the body affected. However, it\nfinds itself incapable of dealing with psychosomatic ill-ness es, depressions and neuroses. These are areas in which Oriental medicine has traditionally been strong\nsince Oriental doctors treat the whole man \u2014 mind\nand body and are concerned with keeping a person\nhealthy. In recent years Oriental medicine has stag-nate d, but now is being rediscovered and as it is developed will be of great benefit to the world of med-i cine. Looking at the world today we see Western\nSociety in all aspects is highly developed materially\nbut barren of spiritual values. This aspect of life we\nmust rediscover if we are to use modern technology\ncreatively and build a world of peace and harmony.\nTo examine and explore the principles which govern man and his environment, and apply the finding in daily life, is the aim of the Unification Church. We have members from all faiths, classes and races, we\nare concerned not with mere beliefs but with understanding the world around us and acting with a sense\nof purpose \u2014 that purpose being to bring about a revolution in the hearts of all men, and thus in their\nenvironment.\nWe believe that this course will help you have\nhope for the future and will inspire you to creative\nactivity in the present.\nWe hope you will show interest in this project \u2022\u2014\napplications for the course should be made to Miss Nicola Barlow, BA,1 Marlowe Road, Cambridge; tel.\n62281.\nIf you haven't seen any of the literature you can\nget more information from Christopher Davies, 28\nLiverpool Road, Thornton Heath, Surrey; tel. 01-653\n8508.\nImperial College Union, Prince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7 2BB.

Next issue: 29th May.\nCopy: 25th May.\n\u00a9 All rights Reserved 1973\nHome-based\nStudents ?\nBy now you will most likely know about the proposed increase in the grant: \u00a340 instead of the original\n\u00a320 on the full grant bringing the full London rate up\nto \u00a3520 per year, and various similar adjustments. But\nwhere does this really leave us? How much will you\nhe getting next year?\nTake my case, for example. This year, living in\nhall, I was entitled to the full London grant of \u00a3480,\nsubject to a deduction due to the income of my parents.\nThis meant that for the whole year the government\npaid me \u00a3112, not enough even to cover my hall fees\nlet alone food, books, etc. Luckily my parents have\nmade a contribution though not the full amount due of\n\u00a3368, they cannot afford to pay so much. I was lucky,\nsome fj a rents pay nothing. The proposed increase would\nmean I would get \u00a3132 next year, the adjustment in the\nparental means test only affects those whose parents\nearn-below \u00a32,000, above this low level parental contributions remain unchanged.\nBut the local authority doesn't even want to pay\n\u00a3132. I live in Harrow, one of the outer London bor-ough s. This month I got a letter which stated \"Students\nresident in this borough who attend London colleges are\nnormally expected to live at home and travel daily to\ncollege, unless they obtain a place in Hall.\" I shall not\nbe in Hall next year so they want me to live at home\nand thus base my grant on the home rate. With the proposed increase, the home rate is \u00a3395. Taking the means\ntest into consideration I would end up with the minim um grant of \u00a350 per year plus some allowance for in creased travel costs. \u00a350 for a year! Even living at home\ntotally dependant on one's parents for food and accommodation this is ridiculous. But besides that what would\nliving at home mean? Harrow is a large borough and\nfrom the part where I live the journey to Imperial College by public transport takes 1 \\ hours, a total of at\nleast 3 hours travelling every day if I were to live at\nhome. And they exp>ect one also to study!\nThis wasn't always the case. Not long ago students\nfrom Harrow attending the Central London colleges\nwere given full grants. But now the government is encouraging home-based students. Not only do they expect students to attend their local college but also that\nthey should spend 3 hours per day travelling to do so.\nThis cannot but have an effect on their studies to say\nthe least.\nFor my set f,1 shall probably be forced to live\nnearer college. If Harrow Education Department\ndoesn't change its mind I shall end up getting less\nmoney to pay the-higher cost of living outside hall than\nI get this year living in Hall. And the government can go to hell with its pathetic grant increases. My grant\nwill be reduced!\nThere are few who will benefit very much from the\nproposed increase. Even for those getting the full\namount of \u00a3480, the rise to \u00a3520 does not even cover\ncost of living increases. This offer is derisory, however\none cannot but admit that without the militant campaign for higher grants this year we would not have got\neven this. For this reason I believe we must continue the\ncampaign next year. It has been shown that we can\nachieve something, let us continue and achieve a decent grant increase benefiting all of us. Of course the\ncampaign will be long, since our power to put pressure\non the government is limited, but we do have some so\nlet us continue to use it as effectively as we can. Because\nthe campaign is long we must be careful in how we\ncarry it out. The tactics we use must aim at putting\nthe maximum pressure on the college authorities and\nthrough them on the government, with the minimum\nharmful effects to ourselves, only thus can we carry\nout a long campaign successfully. But above all, think\nabout it. Some students, those on discretionary awards,\nstill get nothing whatsoever, the government has not\neven mentioned these in its recent proposals. Surely, a decent grant for all students is our right. Let us fight\nfor that. .\nSOMA HOCK F ELDER "

IC's Chess Club completed the double when the\nFirst Team defeated the Second Team 4\\\u2014\\\\ in the\nfinal of the Pugh Cup( Puke-up?) last week.\nThe Firsts had reached the final by winning a strong preliminary tournament and then defeating St.\nThomas' Hospital 6 \u2014 0 in the semi-final. The Seconds\nwere hoping for another upset, as there had been when\nthey defeated Westfield in the semi-final, but they were\nquickly outplayed on four boards, including a brilliant\nwin by Mark( where's my pint?) Hassall over Deniz\nGeorgiou. The game of the match, however, was on\nboard five, where R Fisher (\"Dwain\") played Dave Ed wards (\"Dwain of the Year\"). It was a close even\nstruggle until \" Dw a in\" mysteriously sacrificed and then\nlost shortly afterwards. \"I was messing about\" said\nDwain, after the match, \"I was winning it all the way\" replied the Dwain-Elect. So the Firsts left for Stan's bar\nchanting, \"We've won the Puke up!\" Results:\u2014\n1 A. Ashby J,D. Tucker \\\n2 M. Hassal 1, D. Georgiou 0\n3 I. Heppell 1, P. Warren 0\n4 R. Marsh1, D. Carr O5R.

Rob Colston\nthe skipper-manager who had a fine season as cap-tain, refused to comment about his team's chances next\nyear.\nThe Second and Third Teams also had a good\nseason losing only one game each, thus showing the\nClub's great strength in depth, yet again.\nDuring the Easter holidays we entertained an\nIraeli college team and with a weakened side lost 4 \u2014 2 .\nMany friends were made and the club is now hoping\nto tour Israel during the Summer playing Israeli col-leg e s.P.L. DAVIES. boating BOAT CLUB The month-long Easter vacation was considerably\nshortened for members of the 1st VIII this year in an\nattempt to maintain their fitness and the mental attitude\ndeveloped last term. The last month of last term saw\nthem in a position not enjoyed by their predecessors for\nmany years. The highlight was their performance in the\nBedford Head in which they won the Colleges pennant\nand came second overall behind Goldie. In doing so\nthey defeated all the Cambridge Colleges that matter.\nTwo weeks later, despite a disastrous clash with Vesta\nand an abysmal Walton crew which cost them 25 sees,\nthey came 15th out of 80. They rounded off the term\nby coming 31st out of 37 crews in the tide way Head\nto become the highest placed IC crew for 15 years.\nThe row itself however was not one of IC's best and\nthey fell short of their predicted 20th. The Saturday before the start of this term saw\nthem at Hammersmith Regatta where, on finding themselves the only Senior A crew, they had to row in the\nElite VIIIs. Of the quality of their row I will say nothing except that they were passed by the Umpire's launch. The next week saw them at Barnes and Mortlake regatta and after disposing of Exeter University in the Senior A semi-final were hopeful of obtaining their\nfirst win of the term.\nHowever a fortnight away from their high protein\ndiet (Mooney pie, chips and beans) had reduced them\nto a shadow of their former selves and a poor row resulted which led to them losing to London RC by \\l.A great deal of confidence building was needed\nafter this defeat and the IC coach had to work extremely hard. Then suddenly something happened and\nthe VIII recaptured last term's form. Which brings us\nto last weekend's All om Cup, the University of Lon don summer regatta.\nThis was the worst All om Cup for years. 39 competitors came from IC and only 78 from all the other\nUL colleges put together, a third of these coming from\nGuys. Special thanks must go to Guys, who at least\nmade an effort. Dick Smith won the novice skulls for\nIC despite the fact that during his first race his complexion resembled the grey of the IC blades, a result of\nspending the previous night at a dinner at the Dorchester, courtesy of the BBC. Fortunately he recovered\nin time for the final against the UL BC secretary Steve\n(where's the Dixon Cup) Dean, who used his position to\ngain a rather excessive rest between races in a pro-gram me, which despite the lack of competitors was\nvery poorly organised. The open sculls was won for IC by Neil James, the Cambridge Blue, in quite a high\nquality field. He also won the Coxed Pairs with Birch\nof UC.I C also had a half share in the Coxless pairs.\nThe Novice VIII were drawn directly into the final\nagainst Guys but since Guys didn't turn up, they had\na row over which I suspect was a disappointing end to\ntheir day. The2 nd VIII were unfortunately knocked out\nin the first round of the Roderick Hill cup, but as this\nis a new crew they can hope to improve on this.\nThus we come back to the 1st VIII. Besides rowing\nin the Open VIIIs they split into two fours. One, in the\nSenior C Coxed restricted division and the other in the Open Coxless division. The Coxed IV completely\noutclassed their opposition in the semi-final and in the\nfinal, after negotiating various power boats came in to win quite comfortably.\nThe story in the Coxless boat was slightly different\nin the semi-final they met a Guys crew containing two\npurples. After a slow start they powered their way\nthrough and after getting 3 lengths clear, saw Guys give\nup. In the final they met a very powerful UCI V containing the National Squad Purple, Birch, two members\nof ly ri an, and a member of Thames Tradesmen.\nA magnificent start saw IC \u00a3 1 up after one minute\nand going away. Unfortunately lack of practice led to\nIC steering into the UCI V and the race was stopped.\nLucky not to be disqualified, IC were forced to re-start\nthe race \\\\ down. Again they got in a good start and\npulled back to level but the two supreme efforts had\ncost them too much and they faded over the last \\ min.\nto lose by 1 1. The two fours joined together for the\nVIII's final, again against Guys. The Guys VIII, containing several ex-purples was quite powerful but no\nmatch for the pseudo-professional (six days training\nper week) IC VIII. They went away from the word go\nand won comfortably by 31.\nIf the regatta was an outstanding success for 1C, one could not say the same for the regatta itself. The\nlow entry, especially the pathetic contribution from the\nHospitals (Guys excepted) was inexcusable. The feeble\nexcuse given was that most of them didn't want to show\ntheir VIIIs just before the Hospital Bumps. What satisfaction they get from saving their eights for a race in\nwhich the fastest boat in UL, with the exception of\nthe purple eight, is in eli gable, I don't know. No excuse\nat all was forthcoming about the lack of novice VIIIs,\nthe absence of which will lead to some very inexperienced Open VIIIs in the near future.\nVOLUNTARY WORK\nAre you a student from\nHarrow?\nWill you be coming\nhome in the holidays?\nAre you looking for\nvoluntary work in the\nholidays, such as running\ngardening week-ends, decorating projects, helping\non holidays for deprived\nchildren, running holiday\nplay groups and visiting\nthe elderly?\nIf so, when you come\nhome (or before) write to:\nMiss C.A. Cusdin,\nCommunity Service Officer, Education Department, London Borough of\nHarrow, The Civic Centre,\nPO Box 22, Station Road,\nHarrow HA12U W, or\n'phone: 863-5611 Ext.\n2408.\nJOHN LANE\nPRESIDENT'S PIECE Students have been giving the D.E.S.a hard time the\nlast two years.\nLast year's abortive attack on student unions led\nto an ungainly retreat by Mrs. Thatcher and the decline and fall of Mr. Van Straubenzee. Now over the\ngrants issue another up-and-coming young junior\n'Norm' St.-John-Stevas, looks like doing himself a grievous injury by falling elephant-like between two\nstools. And worse still the Daily Telegraph launches a campaign to force Mrs. Thatcher to design and appoint a Fascist Government pledged to Monday Club\nPolicies no doubt involving a general strike of stock-brokers, financiers, land speculators and Admirals and\na mass exodus to the Coyman Islands.\n\u00a320 may be enough to allow some Vice-Chancellors\nto put refectory prices or hall rents up without more\nthan a twinge of conscience but it is not going to be\nenough to buy off many students. The proposals will\nbe seen for what they are: an attempt to pacify some\nsections of the campaign and minimise support for\nthose rent strikers who are facing victim is ation( some-times completely illegal) from their College Authorities. Because married woman have had no increase\nsince 1965 they are supposed to be glad to get some-thing. Better means test arrangements if your potential\nincome is under \u00a32,000 are supposed to take the steam\nout of the campaign against the means test. And the\n\u00a320 increase should bring back 'moderate' opinion into\nthe fold, win lots of Tory votes in the General Election\nand make Mrs. Thatcher the first non-male M.P. since\nTed Heath.\nIn fact the Government will have to face a bitter\nreaction particularly from discretionary award students who still face exactly the same discrimination as\nbefore. So as 'Norm' spectacularly misses the stool\nhe was aiming at, 'moderate' student opinion (Tory\nstudents, et al) will become increasingly appalled that\nhe left his original seat of total intra si gence. For militancy has worked after well-argued memos were seen\nto fail. The lessons are clear. After the Triennial Review in 1968 the grant increase recommended was\nhalved. The 'moderates' in control of N.U.S. could do\nnothing more than foam (politely, of course) at the\nmouth. In 1971 N.U.S. mounted the first campaign\nwhich attempted to involve ordinary students in any\nsort of mass activity. The Review then did nothing to\nchange the discretionary award system but at least\nthe Government did pay up the full amount they\nagreed to. The fact that now under pressure from a campaign of unprecedented mass militancy from students the\nGovernment has partly broken the Triennial Review\nprocedure to give an interim reward which should encourage us to redouble our efforts.\nWhy did the Government feel it had to bury us off\nanyway? Partly it was due to pressure from College\nAuthorities faced w j th rent strikes, catering boycotts,\nstrikes, occupations and other such disruptions. The\namount of support we received helped (even old age\npensioners joined the picket of the D.E.S.). Perhaps\nthe most important factor, one which is often forgot-ten, is that the students of today are the teachers,\ntechnologists, doctors, etc., of the future. Equally the\nmilitant students of today are the militant white collar\ntrade unionists of tomorrow. The disaffection of the\n\"middle strata\" at the same time as massive conflict\nare taking place between the Government and the\nworking class could lead to its downfall. A very real\nfear brought forth the \u00a320 and caused the Tories to\nditch their \"moderate\" supporters.\nLastly what of those who said we could win nothing\nwithout bringing down the Government. To say the\nleast they look a bit foolish!\nThe way to get united action from students is around\ndemands which would meet their real needs and which\nthey see as being just. Bring-the-Tories-down-type slogans immediately split as before Tory, anti-Tory and\nindifferent not to mention those who want to bring\ndown Labour governments too. Any serious splits make\nthe task of winning allies very difficult and gives the\nGovernment as easy way to discredit us.\nThe N.U.S. extraordinary conference on grants\nshould decide on firstly, measures to defend victimised\nrent strikers, secondly specific plans for an even bigger\ncampaign next session, and thirdly concrete proposals\nto win practical support from the Labour movement\ninstead of just talking about it.\n\n"

Excellent score\u2014Alan Price.\nDirected by \u2014 Lindsay Anderson.\nAbout3 hours long.\nWarner Rendezvous\u2014all seats\nbook able, and I should, unless you want to be done for \u00a31.15 (in cl. VAT). Lindsay Anderson doesn't make\nfilms very often, he has only made\n\" The Sporting Life\" and \"If\" in the\nlast 10 years or so. But even so he is\none of the best known British dire c tors, because however much you\nmay resent his attitude, his technique is both very slick and very dir-ect. Unfortunately, since his films\nhave on average four years between\nthem, he tends to go in and out of\nvogue quite quickly; and since we\nfilm critics are fickle things, some of\nus couldn't remember if he was coming into or out of vogue. Hence his\nnew film. \" 6 Lucky Man!\" Got very\nmixed reviews. ,\nIt is a traumatic film of real ex-treme s, like in a way, Monty Python,\nwhich is \"brilliant\" unless you find\nyourself on the receiving end of\nthe humour, when it becomes \"rub-b ish.\" This film take a dig at every-one; one gets the impression that\nLindsay Anderson has been quietly\nfestering somewhere for a few years\nand has suddenly come out to come\nand tell us. what he thinks of us, the\nestablishment, the rich, the poor, the\nintellectual\u2014everyone in fact. So\ndon't see the film if, you're easily\noffended., j The film is supposedly based on\nMalcolm MacDowell's experiences\nas a coffee salesman and social climber brimming over with confidence.\nStraight out of school. He is Mick Travis (of 'If) again\u2014not so origin-al, but more ambitious, he wants to\nbe successful, rich and famous. I think we are meant to regard it as af of i ow on from \"If\" \u2014 his old headmaster re-appears re-personified as\nthe director of the coffee factory, and\nagain as a prison governor. This is\npossibly what I found so killing\nabout this film. It is implied that all people can be classified into types\u2014\nhence all the actors play 3 or 4 different parts, and it's fun trying to\nplay \"Spot the Celebrity.\" Arthur Lowe, for example, turns up as the\ntraining officer in the coffee factory,\na dishonest hotelier, and an African\nhead of state. I must admit I found\nit difficult to imagine Arthur Lowe in black make-up saying \"hello\nthere,\" that is, until I saw the film.\nMick Travis bounces from situation to situation\u2014it would spoil it to\nlet on exactly what he does do, since\nhalf the fun of the film is the conf u sion. But the direction is faultless\nand biting; he even keeps the p seu ds at bay by opening the film with a shot of Alan Price and band doing\nthe sessions for the Musical Score in a studio. Lindsay Anderson himself\nsitting beside him, stop watch in \u2022\nhand. Very Brechtian. It continues\nto be Brechtian as the other songs\nare not superimposed on soundtrack\nbut more shots in studio; and finally\nit becomes uncontrollably Brechtian\nby having Mick Travis' last experience being picked out of a crowd of\nhopefuls, by Lindsay Anderson him-self, to star in a Lindsay Anderson\nfilm. He is told to pose and smile, as\nan \" O Lucky Man.\" Clapperboard\nis thrust in front of him. The rest of\nthe film is not very Brectian at all, however.\nBut there's no point in getting all poof y and intellectual about this\nfilm. I hope you saw \" Film73\" last\nweek when some film critic tried to\nget all poof y and intellectual (bad) in front of Lindsay Anderson (fatal)\nand being told to poof off. This is\nan escapist, enjoyable film\u2014lots of\nsex, violence, humour and pathos. So\ndo see it, if only for the experience.\nBesides, it may be the 'in' film of the\nyear, and you can impress your\nfriends by talking about it (like I have\nbeen attempting to do all week).\nSERGEI. Judge Roy Bean 'The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean.' Directed by John Huston.\n'Judge Roy Bean' in the latest in the long line of 'realistically mythical'\nwestern which starred with \" The man\nwho shot Liberty Valance\" and reached a peak with \" Butch Cassidy and\nthe Sundance Kid.\" Like these other\nfilms ' Roy Bean' takes a nostalgic\nlook at the taming of the Wild West\nat the turn of the century, the story\nbeing amusingly fantastic but given\na scrupulous attention to period de-tail.\nIt is about a crook (Paul Newman)\nwho, after being robbed in a bandit's bord elo, decides to bring his own violent brand of law to the area.\nUnder his lynch law the town expands and changes and he settles\ndown to life with a local girl Marie\nElena (Vicky Privizal) who is second\nonly to his idol Lily Langtry in his\naffections. However his unorthodox\nmethods and refusal to become 'res-pec table' with the town makes him enemies who bring about his downfall as a sly lawyer whom he once\nhumiliated takes over, this and the\ndeath of Marie Elena in childbirth\ninduce him to ride into the sunset in best tradition.\nUnlike King Arthur he returns 20\nyears later when the lawyer tries to\nevict his daughter from what is now\nan oil town. In a spectacular blazing\nshoot up Roy Bean gets his revenge\nand goes into history. The final scene\nshows Lily Langtry ( Ava Gardner)\nvi sting what is now a ghost town returned to its hick origin the cycle\ncompleted, the myth established.\nThe film is constructed episodic ally which accounts for its unevenness,\nblack humour needs to be very carefully done, and the director (John\nHuston, one of the old Hollywood\nschool) sometimes miscalculates, I don't for instance, think someone\nhaving his toes blown off is funny. He also has a tendency to be over sent i mental and derivative, often in the\nsame scenes, remember Paul Newman and Katherine Ross with bicycle\nand Sacha Distel in 'Butch Cassidy\"?\nWell here we have Paul Newman and\nVicky Privizal with see-saw and would you believe Andy Williams\nsinging something called \" marm a lade, molasses and honey\"? Needless\nto say the song is as sickly as the\ntitle suggests.\nThese mistakes and more elementary ones of continuity and timing\nstop the film realising its full potential which is shown especially when\nhe returns, to defend his daughter's rights; the ensuing shoot and burn-up is one of the most enjoyable pieces\nof cinema for a long time, scenes\nsuch as this and the 'cameo' scenes\nwith Anthony 'Psycho' Perkins, Hus: ton himself and others, make this\nfilm in spite of its faults one of the\nmore enjoyable ones going the\nrounds.\n' NATHAN BRITTLE S.' Family Family always have had a reputation as being musically, a very fine\nband, and Thursday night did little\nbut enhance just that. Their set began with some tromping music, in which I suppose I should remember\nbut don't, to which they appeared\nand started into what was quite a freaky number for Family, complete\nwith staff e effects\u2014a smoke bomb. lasting well throughout the first ten\nminutes or so, and their own lights,\nblending and changing well with the\nmood of the music. Rather unfortunate for the people at the front though\nwho soon rose, spluttering, to their\nfeet as it spewed over from the stage.\nOn the whole they played quite a versatile set with times when they did\nthe more acoustic numbers from their\nalbum \"Fearless,\" and times when\nthey fairly rocked, especially with\n\"Burlesque\" and \"Weaver's Answer\"\nthe latter being slightly adapted to\nsuit the new line-up rather for the\nworse I thought, as it was a little\nsloppy in the middle.\nThe only black mark to the evening was that Roger Chapman appeared the worse for drink, and threw a phenomenal amount of microphone stands and tambourines\nabout, often into the front row of\nthe audience, who remained, fortunately very docile about it.\nPhillip Goodhand Tait, the support act, I liked very much, singing\nrather soulfully and sincerely his own\ncompositions (apart from the, two\nBuddy Holly classics he slipped in),\n>elf-accompanied on the piano,\nhough there were times when he\nmilled out some Cocker power. The only thing he did wrong for me was\nto stop so early.\nG. J.K. "
