It often\nseems as though the same\nissues that were being\ndebated six months ago\nare being debated now.\nThe Irish backstop was\none of the major issues\nplaguing May\u2019s deal\nand it continues to harry\nBoris Johnson now. The\nintractability of the whole\nissue has proved highly\nfrustrating, with politicians and people either\ndesiring Brexit now, a no-deal now, or no Brexit at\nall. Above anything else,\nwhat the British people\nappear to desire is closure.\nOne man that has\nbeen prepared to give the\nBritish people this sense\nof closure has had a rather\nalarming recall to reality\nin the past two weeks.\nFollowing his election to\nthe role of Prime Minister\nby the members of the\nConservative party on\nthe 24th of July this year,\nBoris Johnson has been\ncommitted to delivering\nBrexit within the official\ndeadline of the 31st\nOctober, with or without\na deal.\nJohnson totally failed\nto progress his No-Deal\nagenda after facing severe\nopposition from the House\nof Commons and made\nthe political decision to\nprorogue Parliament for 5\nweeks starting on the 10th\nSeptember. The official\njustification he provided\nwas that this unprecedented 5-week suspension\nwas to prepare for a new\nQueen\u2019s speech, where\nhe would lay out his new\nand exciting agenda of tax\ncuts and spending plans.\nHowever, given the proximity of the long proroga-tion to the 31st October,\nmany in Parliament took\nthe idea that this was done\nin order to prevent MPs\nfrom passing legislation\nthat would potentially\nprevent a no deal Brexit.\nMPs swiftly took action\nto seize control of the\nbusiness of the House and\nproposed a motion that\nwould prevent the Prime\nMinister from leaving the\nEU without a deal. Both\nof these motions passed,\npreventing the government from proposing\nadditional legislation, and\nlegally blocking Johnson\nfrom committing to a\nNo-Deal, instead forcing\nhim to extend the deadline\nand continue negotiations.\nIn response to this\nJohnson attempted to\ntrigger an early general\nelection, but political\nparties in opposition and\n21 of his own MPs voted\nagainst the government\nand he failed to reach\nthe necessary two thirds\nmajority. After this vote,\nParliament was pro-rogued. This prorogation\nwas scheduled to end\n14th October. During this\nperiod of prorogation, two\ncourt cases went through\nthe English and Scottish\ncourts, one from Gina\nMiller, an anti-Brexit\ncampaigner and one from\na cross party group of\nMPs. Both cases were\nheard, and the ultimate\nresult was that Johnson\u2019s\nprorogation was deemed\n\u201cto have no effect.\u201d ParIt is clear, from the\nrecent court judgement\nthat the institutions of\nthe UK have come under\ndirect attack from a group\nof individuals that have\nno regard for them. Their\nsingular desire to deliver\nL\norem ipsum\ndolor sit amet,\nc o n s e c t e t u r\na d i p i s c i n g\nelit. Phasellus conva-llis rhoncus ultricies.\nMorbi lacinia congue\ncommodo.

It is of\ngreat comfort then that the\ninstitutions available to\nthe British state, namely\nthe courts, have been more\nthan capable of thwarting\ntheir actions. The UK\ngovernment institutions\nare largely robust.\nThe one, possibly con-troversial, key takeaway\nof the series of events we\nhave witnessed in the last\nmonth and a half is that it is\npossible to make progress\non Brexit. Legally ruling\nout an option, despite what\nardent Leavers may claim,\nis still progress towards an\neventualsolution.Brexitis\npossibly the most complex\nand difficult political\nand legal problem that\nthe United Kingdom has\nencountered for the last\n40 years. It has not been\neasy, it will not be easy.\nThe risk now is that the\nJohnson administration\nwill ignore the legislation.\nThe current Chancellor\nSajid Javid has repeatedly\nmade reference to the possibility of a no deal Brexit,\nas has Johnson. This is an\nunacceptable attack on the\nsovereignty of Parliament\nand speaks volumes as to\ntheir true intentions- to\nutilise Brexit as a political\ntool for winning the next\nelection as opposed to\ndoing the best thing for\nthe country. This is not\ngood governance and it is\ncertainly poor policy for\nour county.\nIt is time to ignore\nthe fickle, so called\n\u201cwill of the people,\u201d and\ntheir desperate desire\nfor closure. Instead, we\nshould demand that our\npoliticians do their jobs\nand work for the country\nas opposed to their narrow\npolitical objectives.\n\n"

No, the real\nworld is a much more\ndreary (but, perhaps,\nmore rewarding) affair of\nmaking tiny incremental\nimprovements over the\ncourse of ages. Thus,\nwe are still on a steep\nlearning curve and have\na long way to go in terms\nof perfecting this year\u2019s\nFelix. Last week saw\nsome fantastic content in\nthe paper, marred by a few\ncopy mistakes - the former\nof which was heartening,\nwhile the latter was dev-astating.\nThis week, I wanted\nto give you, the reader,\na little insight into how\nFelix works, and how\nthings can go wrong,\nand how copy mistakes\ncan happen. Take it as a\nlesson, if you want, but\nI won\u2019t dictate which\none - I\u2019m a firm believer\nthat a story can have many\nparables contained within,\nand I hope that you find\nsomething of value in this\none. That may be not to\nobsess over perfectionism\nand to take the good with\nthe bad. It may be to\nrealise that the best way\nto make up for a mistake\nis to proactively improve\nfor the future rather than\nattempt to retroactively\ncorrect.\nThe lesson might also\nbe that laughing at one\u2019s\nown misfortune makes it\nall a little more bearable\n- a lesson I think Imperial\nstudents learn very well\nvery quickly.\nYou\u2019ll each take away\nthe one that will help you\nthe most - or maybe I\u2019m\njust talking some right\n\u2018pretentious twaddle\u2019 and\nshould just get on with it.\nFirst, a little bit of\nbehind-the-scenes insight:\nbefore the beginning\nof each year, the Editor\nbuilds up a team, and\ntrains them as soon as possible (depending on their\npre-term availability). The\nfirst issue rolls around: we\nconfirm page numbers on\nthe Tuesday and lay out\nthe articles using InDesign on the Wednesday\n- and then Thursday is for\ncopyediting, any last-min-ute laying out, invariably\naxing some pages when\nsomebody sends you a\nthree-page Welcome Fair\nMap to include out-of-the-blue at 5pm on the\nday of publication, and so\non. Then, come Thursday\nevening, I finally spend\na long while compiling\nall that hard work and\nsending it to print.\nThis should work out\ncleanly and nicely - and\nindeed, we had plenty of\npeople providing great\ncontent and a mostly-full\nteam, so that stage was\nfantastic. As I said last\nweek, the team did a\nsmashing job. The problems came on Wednesday\nand Thursday.\nOne thing many readers\nmay not notice is that the\namount of team turnover\nFelix experiences each\nyear can vary massively.\nSometimes the turnover\nis very minimal, with\nfew editors graduating\nor moving on - and those\nlater-year students are\nalready trained, already\nhave good working relationships with writers, and\nare often around before\nthe beginning of term.\nThis year, however,\nwe lost almost two-thirds\nof our editorial team\nduring summer. This was\nofficially designated as\n\u2018sad times\u2019 as a lot of our\nlittle internal community\ngot the Thanos treatment.\nActually, as it was almost\ntwo-thirds of the team,\nthey outdid Thanos.\nBut for the paper, this\ncan be a positive thing -especially in the long run.\nWe\u2019ve got new voices and\nfresh ideas and perspectives popping up all over\nalready. It\u2019s invigorating,\nit\u2019s exciting, and it was\na pleasure to receive\nso many emails from\nincoming first-year students who wanted to get\ninvolved before they even\narrived. We had articles in\nthe paper written by new\nstudents, who then arrived\nat halls to find their work\nprinted and on their desks\nalready. That\u2019s awesome.\nThis is the new generation\nof Felix.\nHowever, it does\ncome with the smallest\ndownside: nobody is\ntrained in InDesign, and\nnobody is in the country\nto be trained, before term\nstarts. Although we had\ngreat content, we had\nalmost nobody available\nto actually lay any of it\nout, nevermind to then\ncopyedit it afterwards\nto check for those silly\nmistakes that inevitably\nhappen. Wednesday and\nThursday quickly turned\ninto a mad scramble to\nget everything together as\nthe articles came flooding\nin, with those few trained\nand available members of\nthe team putting in some\nHerculean efforts to get\neverything done on time.\nI won\u2019t shout them out\npublicly, but they know\nwho they are.\nOf course, I haven\u2019t\neven touched on the slew\nof tech problems we\u2019ve\nbeen assailed with.\nThis is how you end up\nwith the copy mistakes\nFelix saw last week.\nEveryone put in 100%, or\neven more than could ever\nbe reasonably expected,\nbut it wasn\u2019t enough to\nmake the perfect paper\n- yet. Sometimes that\u2019s\njust how things pan out. I\nwas frustrated, but again,\nit was a good-natured\nand very tired team who\ngot me back on my feet\nand immediately looking\ntowards this week and\nhow to improve.\n\u2018Another week, another\nissue\u2019 may become a\nmantra of mine this year,\na way to remind myself to\nlook forward and ascend\never-forward toward a\nthrone with \u201cWriting Stuff\nGooder\u201d emblazoned on\nthe seat.\nFront Cover // Taja Strle\nA\n\n"

As of\nthe first week of October\n2019, there had already\nbeen over 121,000 recorded fires in the Brazilian\nAmazon. This is a 45%\nincrease when compared\nto the same period last\nyear. While that number is\nincreasing at an unwavering rate, it\u2019s not just the\nfrequency of fires that\u2019s\nraising alarms, but also\ntheir magnitudes. Fires\nreached a scale so large\nthat in mid-August NASA\nreported that the blazes\nwere visible from space.\nWild fires in the\nAmazon are perfectly\nnormal during the summer\nmonths, during which the\nrainforest experiences a\ndry season, however, the\nBrazilian Amazon has\nbeen notably moist this\nyear according to University of Birmingham ecologist Adriane Muelbert.\nWhilst the exact causes\nof the infernal destruction\naren\u2019t certain, the moist\nconditions strongly imply\nan unnatural origin. A\nresearcher at Brazil\u2019s\nNational Institute for\nSpace Research (INPE)\nhas suggested that 99%\nof the fires result from\nhuman activity, either on\npurpose or by accident.\u2019\nGlobally, the single\nlargest direct cause of\ntropical deforestation is\nconversion to cropland\nand pasture for food,\nin order to grow crops\nand raise livestock. The\nslash and burn method,\nin which forest is cut and\nany remaining vegetation\nburned to produce fertile\nland, is particularly\npopular among Brazilian\nfarmers and ranchers.\nHowever, the initial\nclearance can lead to a\nfar greater amount of\ndestruction than intended\nwhen some vegetation is\nleft intact. The felling of\ntrees in the initial cutting\ntears a hole in the usually\ncontinuous canopy,\nexposing vegetation on\nthe forest floor to the\nintense tropical sun and\nincreasing the likelihood\nof a fire starting.\nSuch a dramatic\nincrease in the scale of\nthe human exploitation\nof one of Earth\u2019s most\nbiodiverse regions in\ncontrast to previous years\nbegs the question, what\nhas changed? On the 1st\nof January 2019, Jair\nBolsonaro assumed the\nrole of the 38th president\nof Brazil. Described as a\nNational Conservative,\na focal point of his\ncampaign and subsequent\npolicies has been the\nacceleration of growth\nfor Brazil\u2019s economy by\npermitting access to the\nAmazon\u2019s natural resources for mining, logging and\nagriculture.Such a utilisa-tion naturally requires the\nremoval of the primary\nforests on which it will\ntake place and Bolsonaro\nhas repeatedly dismissed\npleas to preserve the rainforest in its entirety, saying\nthat European countries\nhave already \u201cdestroyed\ntheir environment\u201d and\nmaintaining the stance\nthat Brazil preserves their\nrainforest \u201cmore than\nanyone\u201d. At a recent UN\nconference in New York,\nBolsonaro also claimed\nthat it was a \u201cfallacy\u201d to\ndescribe the Amazon as\nthe heritage of humanity\nand a \u201cmisconception\u201d\nthat the forests are the\nlungs of the planet In the\nwake of such comments,\nmany environmentalists\nare accusing the president\u2019s policies of being\nthe root cause of the fires\nthat have devastated the\nAmazon this year, with\nhis encouragement of\ncattle farmers and loggers\nto clear land for their practices being the focus of\ntheir criticism. Following\nreports by Brazil\u2019s own\nINPE that Destruction\nof the Amazon rainforest\nhad increased by 88%\nfor the month of June\n2019, which the president\nrejected as false data,\nBolsonaro claimed that\nthat his government lacks\nthe resources to fight the\nwildfires in the Amazon.\nDespite this contention, he\ndeclined to accept a lump\nsum of $22m (\u00a318m) from\nthe G7 , an intergovernmental group consisting\nof the seven \u2018largest\nadvanced economies\u2019 in\nthe world, which aimed to\naid the battle against the\never growing crisis.\nto the commercialisa-tion of the rainforest. A\ncommon theme among\ndemonstrators was their\ndiscouragement of beef\nconsumption and for\ngood reason. According\nto the Yale School of\nForestry and Environmental Studies, cattle\nranchingSSSS is the\nlargest driver of deforestation in the Amazon, accounting for 80 per cent\nof current deforestation\nrates leading to proposals\nfrom European government officials that the EU\nshould ban the import of\nbeef from Brazil. It\u2019s not\njust the public who are\ntaking action, multiple\nEuropean governments\nhave threatened to\nabandon trade deals with\nBrazil following disputes\nwith the president over\nhis environmental policy.\nGermany and Norway\nhave also stopped\ncontributing to an aid\nfund for the country. A\nparticularly confrontational exchange occurred\nbetween the Brazilian\npresident and French\nPresident Emmanuel\nMacron on social media\nafter Bolsonaro liked\na Facebook comment\nmocking Macron for\nmarrying a woman 25\nyears his senior. The\ninstance of playground\npolitics was spurred on\nby France\u2019s attempt to\nblock the ratification of a\ntrade deal between South\nAmerica and the EU.If\nthe political and environmental chaos that has\nerupted since Bolsonaro\u2019s election is indicative\nof the remainder of his\nterm, Brazil is in for an\ninteresting three years.\nA satellite view of the Amazon fires taken by NASA\u2019s MODIS sensor // earth observatory\n\u201cBolsonaro\nclaimed\nthat it was a\n\u2018misconception\u2019that the\nforests are the\nlungs of the\nplanet\u201d\nBrazil\u2019s president\u2019s\nseemingly nonchalant\nattitude towards the\ncurrent devastation of his\ncountries natural wonder\nhas resulted in a global\noutcry, with activists\nswarming Brazilian\nembassies worldwide.

The Seven Ages of\nPatience:\nA Community Play\nF\new of us, or at\nleast not myself,\nhave sat back\nand wondered\nwhat a day in the life of\nMelania Trump would\nbe like. Having said that,\nperhaps a few of us have\npondered in fascination\nover the inner workings\nof Mrs. Trump\u2019s mind,\nand the implications and\nconsequences of being\nmarried to a President of\nthe United States, not to\nmention the implications\nand consequences of being\nmarried to Donald Trump.\nTwo Ladies, written by\nNancy Harris, gives us an\ninsight into the world of\nthe WAGs of politics.\nOur story is unsur-prisingly narrated by two\nladies: Helen, played by\nthe wonderful Zo\u00eb Wanamaker, is largely based\non Brigitte Macron, and\nSophia, played by Zrinka\nCvite\u0161i\u0107, resembles\nMelania Trump in life\nand in character. Although\nthere is no mention of\neither Trump or Macron,\nHarris leaves very little\nto the imagination as to\nwhere her inspiration\nof characters may have\nemerged, with Helen\nbeing a 66-year-old\nteacher whose husband\nis 20 years her junior and\nSophia, an ex-fashion\nmodel from the Balkans.\nWe meet Helen waiting\nin an empty hotel conference room in France,\nour home for the night,\nas she anxiously waits\nfor her husband to finish\na meeting down the hall\nwhere he and other world\nleaders are discussing\nimpending military\naction. Much to Helen\u2019s\ndismay, she is joined\nrather abruptly by Sophia,\nwho has been recently\ndoused with animal blood\nby a protestor. The two\nare forced by their staff\nto remain alone together\nuntil the summit and associated protests conclude.\nThis compulsory rendezvous births the following\n90 minutes as the pair\ndiscuss their resented\nroles of wives of presi-dents; secrets are shared,\nand bonds are made.\nThe pair provide contrasting commentary on\ntypes of female power,\nalthough both accounts\nhighlight the vast amount\nof progress yet to be made\nin the realm of gender\nequality. Helen tells of\nthe sacrifices that she\nhas made in order for her\nhusband to be President,\nthe limits to her career, and\nalso of the vast amounts\nof unpaid work that her\nlife now involves. It is\nalso revealed, with raised\neyebrows, that Helen is\nher husband\u2019s unofficial,\nand unacknowledged,\nadvisor, with many of his\nbest ideas actually being\nhers. At the other end of\nthe room, Sophia speaks of\nusing her physical beauty\nas her secret weapon, both\nin her past life in Croatia\nand her current life as\nFirst Lady of the United\nStates. She tells of being\nrepeatedly undermined\nyet is surprisingly aware\nof how others perceive\nher. As the play builds to\na close, tensions rise to\nboiling point, the ladies\nencouraging one another\nof the life that should and\ncould be.\nLuckily for midweek\nviewers, you do not\nneed to attend with fully\nengaged brains as Harris\nvery helpfully spells\nalmost everything out\nfor her audience with a\nslightly clunky dialogue.\nThe play is brought to life\nby superb acting on behalf\nof both Wanamaker and\nCvite\u0161i\u0107, who make the\nunimaginative characters\nreal and accessible. It\nwas a good reminder of\ncurrent issues around\ngender politics, however\nI left with no new ideas,\nonly an appreciation of\nthe fabulous cast.\nI\nn a moment where the\ntensions in our country are running high,\nwhere neighbours\nand friends are divided\nalong political lines, and\nwhere it feels as though a\ngreat cloud of apathy has\nsettled over the United\nKingdom, Chinonyerem\nOdimba\u2019s \u2018The SevenAges\nof Patience\u2019 is a breath\nof fresh air. It chronicles\nthe life of a woman\nnamed Patience whose\nexperiences are rendered\non stage against the\nbackdrop of the London\nBorough of Brent. Its rich\nnarrative, looking back\nover Patience\u2019s life from\n1945 to the present day,\nspans the topics of racism,\nfeminism, gentrification,\nausterity and the importance of community.\nThe play opens with\na white coffin. A young\nblack woman explains\nthat this is her coffin, her\nstory, and that her name\nis Patience. The young\nPatience is replaced on\nstage by a plethora of\njoyful mourners, people\nfrom the important\nchapters of her life. The\ncast, consisting of over\none hundred non-profes-sional actors and volunteers from Brent and the\nlocal area, each appear\non the stage to share their\nmemories of Patience, and\nin doing so reveal pieces\nof Brent\u2019s history. The\nlocal cast are exciting to\nwatch, brimming with\nfizz, crackle and chemis-try, and they bring a warm\nenergy and authenticity\nto the play which is\namplified by the audience,\nmany of whom have come\nto see a friend or loved\none on stage. Each of the\nfour actresses who depict\nPatience\u2019s life from young\nto old has an inviting\npresence and Imperial\nDramSoc alumni Tom\nCunningham also shines\nin his role as Richard the\nForrester.\nThe Seven Ages of\nPatience is a love letter to\nBrent, a \u2018place of Turkish\nrestaurants, African hair-Road you can dance \u2018to\nthe tune of the Irish fiddle,\nor the sweetness of the\nsteel drum\u2019. Odimba\u2019s\nastute script is fresh,\nwitty and often moving: it\ndoes not pull its punches\nwhen remarking on the\nabundance of \u2018lattes and\nestate agents\u2019 on the High\nRoad, but also pays testament to the harsh realities\nof racism, austerity and\nviolence.\nIn one particularly affecting moment, a young\nPatience bids goodbye to\nthe spirit of her mother,\nkilled in a bombing during\nthe second world war. Her\nmother says that she must\nlearn to \u2018take her sadness\nand make it something\nbeautiful in the world\u2019:\na mantra which Patience\nrepeats at moments of\ngreat darkness in her life.\nThese range from racism\ndirected towards her and\nher colleagues while\nworking as a midwife,\nto the moment Stephen\nLawrence is killed in\n1993. It is a mantra which\nPatience leaves as her\nlegacy in the community\nof Brent. And during the\nplay\u2019s closing song \u2018We\nAre Brent\u2019, the sense of\ncommunity in the Kiln\ntheatre couldn\u2019t have been\nstronger.\nThe two ladies face off // Bridge Theatre\nARTS\nPoppy Hayes\nArts Writer\nWhere?

    "content": "Dogfight\nI\nt is intriguing how\na musical with such\na fierce name can\nbe so gentle and\nsensitive. Amidst the\nbrash soldiers and their\nswearing, Dogfight shines\nlight on the importance\nof not being judgmental\nand accepting each others\u2019\ndifferences to work\ntogether. Dogfight, in a\nyouth production by the\nBritish Theatre Academy\nat Southwark Playhouse,\ntransforms the room into\nSan Francisco in the 60s,\nwhere a group of young\nMarines are gearing up\nto be shipped off to the\nVietnam war. Their last\nnight home manifests into\na twisted tale of debauch-ery, heartbreak, and\neventually apprehension\nfor the life left behind.\nThe musical is based\non the 1991 movie of the\nsame name, a love story\nbetween Eddie (Lucca\nChadwick-Patel), a newly\nenlisted Marine, and Rose\n(Ginnie Thompson), a\nshy diner waitress. The\nMarines host a party,\ncalled the \u201cdogfight\u201d, to\ncelebrate their last night of\nfreedom. The \u201cdogfight\u201d\nis a legendary night where\neach Marine must bring\nthe ugliest girl they can\nto the dance floor to win\na prize, and, of course,\nbragging rights. Plot\ntwist though, Eddie falls\nin love with his \u201cugly\u201d\ndate, Rose, and realises\nhow horrible the dogfight\nreally is. The real ugly\npeople are the Marines\nfor being egotistical and\nshallow.\nThe dramatic story\nwas spirited and unique,\nand the passionate performances by the soldiers\nmade it worthwhile.\nThe protagonists were\nsoldiers who objectified\nwomen and took pleasure\nin their degradation. It\nwas amazing how the\nperformance progressed\nwith the protagonists\nbecoming easily the most\nhated characters for being\nso condemnatory. The\nconvincingly cruel and\nheartless personas of\nEddie and his comrades\nwere a testament to the\ngreat acting of the cast,\nwith special mention\nto Matty Collins and\nJames Knudsen for their\npowerful performances.\nThe set and audience\nseating were in a tightknit\nspace and the hilarious\ninteractions between\nthe cast and viewers\nmade the musical an\nimmersive experience,\nespecially the number\n\u201cHey Good Lookin\u201d when\nthe Marines went on the\nquest to find dates for the\n\u201cdogfight\u201d. Their liberal\nuse of foul language only\nmade it feel more comical\nand real. However, given\nhow small the space was,\nthe musical numbers\ncould have been improved\nwith better acoustics. The\norchestra often took over\nthe singing making the\nperformance disjointed at\ntimes.\nDogfight runs for an uninterrupted 105 minutes,\nwhich naturally led the\naudience to get more\nengrossed and invested\nin the story - without any\npopcorn or loo tainted dis-tractions! Even with such\na serious performance,\ndogfight was digestible\nand tactfully conveyed a\ndifficult message about\nsexism.\nDespite their differenc-es, the sense of camaraderie between the Marines\nwas beautiful, and the\naudience was visibly\nmoved by the ultimate\nbattle scene when these\nseemingly invincible\ncharacters writhed in pain\nand died. The best scene,\nhowever, (SPOILER\nALERT) was the epic\nstrobe light scene when\nEddie is transformed\nback to his grim reality\nwhere he is on the bus\nback home from war and\ndogfight seems like just\nan inconsequential misde-meanour. The audience is\nmade aware that the major\npart of the musical \u2013 the\ndogfight, the mistreatment\nof girls and the brotherhood that was the Three\nBees was just ... a regret,\na flashback.\nA story about toxic\nmasculinity and patriarchy for objectifying\nwomen and basing their\nself worth solely on their\nlooks is as much of a\ncautionary tale as it is a\nreminder of times when\nsettings like this were\nmore prevalent. These\nthemes are still relevant\nin today\u2019s world where\nmisogynistic attitudes\ncontinue to rear their ugly\nheads from time to time.\nThe simplicity of the\nset and characters gave a\nraw and forceful message.\nThe plain set had minimal\nprops, meaning the actors\nrelied solely on their\nacting to transform the\nsmall room in London\ninto America in the 60\u2019s.\nLike all dogs in a fight,\nthe individual \u2018dogs\u2019 were\nultimately vulnerable\nand innocent, as were the\nMarines themselves.\nOverall, Dogfight was\nan excellent production\nand not one to miss,\nsending a message of\npositivity and kindness.\nWhen Camaraderie and Debauchery Are Confused\nISSUE 1728\nFELIX\n15\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nDisha\nBandyopadhyay\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Promising an\nend to the harsh austerity\npolicies imposed by the\nConservative \u2013 Lib Dem\ncoalition government that\nhas killed an estimated\n130,000 people, and a\nreturn to the democratic\nsocialist and trade unionist politics the party was\nfounded on, \u201cCorbynism\u201d\noffered renewed hope to\nmillions of people; leading to the biggest increase\nin the party\u2019s vote share\nsince 1945 in the 2017\nGeneral Election.\nHowever, during\nmy time at this year\u2019s\nConference in Brighton,\nI witnessed a new surge\nof bold, vibrant policies\nbeing pushed by the\ngrassroots membership.\nSome people have\nstarted to call it \u201cCorbynism without Corbyn\u201d,\nor \u201cCorbynism 2.0\u201d.\nBut what exactly does it\nentail?\nThe boldest and most\ntransformative policy to\npass through the votes\non the conference floor\nwas the Green New\nDeal motion: a plan to\ntackle climate change by\npushing for mass public\ninvestment in renewable energy, aiming for\nfree public transport\nand public ownership\nof our energy grid,\nand green, unionised\njobs for all who want\nthem. Alongside these\nproposals, a target for\nnet-zero carbon emissions by 2030 was set\nby the motion, a target\nthat is in line with the\nscientific community\u2019s\nanalysis of the urgency\nof action, as specified\nin the landmark IPCC\nreport.\nThe motion getting\nthrough was a massive\nsuccess for one of\nthe newest grassroots\ncampaigns in the Party:\nLabour for a Green\nNew Deal. I remember\ntheir volunteers, in their\ngreen tshirts, huddled\naround at conference,\nbusy coordinating\nrallies, protests, and\nmuch more. Earlier\nthis year, the group\nheld events across the\ncountry, including one\nwith the Labour Society\nat Imperial, as part of\ntheir campaign launch.\nIt felt wonderful to have\nplayed a small part in\nthe campaign, especially\nwhen I received the\nnews that the motion\nhad passed and become\nLabour Party policy.\nOther policies passed\nat conference included a\nmigrants\u2019 rights motion\nthat included the maintenance and extension\nof free movement for\nall, the end of NHS\nrestrictions, extension\nof voting rights to all\nUK residents and the\nclosure of detention\ncentres. Another policy\ncommitted Labour to\nworking towards a 4 day\nwork week with no loss\nof pay (we could all do\nwith 3 day weekends!),\nwith another committing\nto the integration of\nprivate schooling into\nthe public sector, ending\nclass segregation in our\nsociety. These policies\nwere not written by\nthe leadership, but\nactively pushed for by\nLabour\u2019s 500,000 strong\ngrassroots member-ship. With a left-wing\nleader, members feel\nempowered to utilise all\nthe party\u2019s democratic\nmechanisms to mould\nit into a party that is by,\nand for, the people.\nExciting policies\nweren\u2019t the only things\ngoing on at Labour party\nconference. On my first\nevening in Brighton,\nafter having met fellow\nyoung activists that I\nhad connected to via\nTwitter, we went along\nto an event organised by\nYoung Labour on \u2018The\nLeft in Power\u2019. A panel\nevent featuring Unite\nGeneral Secretary Len\nMcCluskey, socialist\nintellectual Leo Panitch,\nLabour candidate Chris\nPeace, Young Democratic Socialist of America\nChair Kristen Cervero,\nand Bernie 2020 campaigner Christian Bowe,\nit was a favourable, yet\ncritical, look at the democratic socialist movements both in the UK\nand the US, with Panitch\norder to bring about real,\ntransformative change\nto their countries. The\nevent had free food and\ndrink and was organised\nby the Young Labour\ncommittee; special shout\nout to them for all their\nexcellent volunteered\nwork!\nOther events throughout conference included\na panel with \u2018Show\nRacism the Red Card\u2019,\nfeaturing excellent\nLabour MPs such as\nDavid Lammy, Laura\nPidcock, and my own\nMP, Tan Dhesi. Tan\nspoke candidly about\nthe moment he spoke\ntruth to power and\ncalled out Boris Johnson\u2019s dangerous rhetoric\naround Muslim women\n\u2013 language that saw a\nspike in hate crimes\naimed at Muslim women\nin the following weeks.\nThese days, we cannot\nhave a politics article\nwithout a mention of the\nmain thing on the agenda\nright now: Brexit. We\nwent in to the conference expecting the party\nto take a pro-remain\nposition given the fact\nthat most of the party\nmembers were pro-re-main. In the end two\nmotions were proposed:\none for the party to\ncampaign for remain\nin a second referendum\nagainst their own negotiated Brexit deal, and\nanother for the party to\nremain neutral until a\nsecond, special one-day\nconference when the\ndeal has been secured, to\ndecide whether to back\nremain or the deal. The\nlatter won the vote.\nPersonally, I think the\nneutral position makes a\nlot of sense. Why would\nwe say we will negotiate\na Brexit deal and then\ncampaign against our\nown negotiated deal?\nThere is a lot of divisive\nBrexit extremism going\non in politics right now:\nthe Lib Dems want to\nundemocratically cancel\nBrexit without a second\nreferendum, and the\nTories want to undem-ocratically force us to\nleave with a disastrous\nno deal with no mandate.\nA neutral position going\ninto a General Election\nwill mean that Labour\ncan focus on its bold\neconomic and environmental proposals and\nleave the question of\nBrexit to the people.\nAfter all, Labour is not\nfor the 52% or the 48%,\nbut the 99%.\nI came away from\nLabour conference\nhopeful for a better\nfuture, and confident\nthat this was a govern-ment-in-waiting that can\nfight for the interests\nof the many. Labour is\nback to its roots and it is\nus members leading the\nway for a bold policy\nplatform. After all, it is\nonly a party by the many\nthat can claim to speak\nfor the many.\nShadow Chancellor Mcdonnell and Leader of the Opposition Corbyn// Wikimedia\n\u201cPersonally,\nI think that\na neutral\nposition on\nBrexit makes\nthe most\nsense\u201d\nparticularly providing\nan insight into how a\nsocialist American President and British Prime\nMinister would have to\ndeal with their respective state institutions in\n\n"

If someone like\nWells had been president\ntoo, perhaps I had a\nchance of becoming just\nas acclaimed.\nHowever, the plot\nthickened after I read\nthrough Wells\u2019 Wikipedia\npage. His term as president of the RCSU supposedly began in 1909, but\nthe RCSU was founded in\n1881. How could he have\nbeen the first president\nif his term started 28\nyears after the union was\nfounded? It turns out that\nthis titbit was called a\n\u2018legend\u2019 for good reason.\nWells had no part in\nfounding the RCSU and\nwas never the president.\nIn fact, he established the\nRCSA, our alumni associ-ation, not the RCSU.\nAt first, this development bothered me. I really\nenjoyed thinking that I\nwas following in the footsteps of a literary giant.\nBut still, while it might\u2019ve\nbeen nice if it were true,\nit\u2019s also nice knowing\n\u2018the\u2019 truth. And I think,\nas the union of scientists,\nthe truth is something we\nreally ought to value.\nAlso, my motivation\nas president should be\nvalidated by more than\nhistorical precedent. I\nshould put in the effort\nbecause I want to, and not\nbecause some famous guy\ndid too.\nI think that this lesson\nextends to many aspects\nof university life. If\nyou\u2019re fresh out of high\nschool, this may be the\nfirst time you\u2019ve gotten to\nchoose what you\u2019re doing\nwith yourself. You should\nstudy because you want to,\nnot just because there is a\nprecedent that you\u2019re told\nto follow. The same goes\nfor recreation, societies,\nand just about everything\nelse. If you abide by this,\nyou\u2019ll probably find that:\n1. You won\u2019t be\nstudying something you\nhate for 3-4 years, and\n2. At the end of your\ndegree, you\u2019ll be happy\nyou made decisions on\nyour own.\nIf you\u2019d like to get\ninvolved with the RCSU,\nlearn more about us,\nor write in this section\nof Felix, swing by our\nof\ufb01ce.

Initially we came in\non July 15th for handover\nwith our predecessors,\nand that was a start. Then\nthey left around August\n1st, and that was a start.\nBut the training sessions\nand residential only\nfinished on August 9th, so\nI suppose that was the real\nstart; we\u2019ve only settled in\nmore recently.\nFelix: What have you\nbeen up to recently?\nAPS: So far, the major\nthings I\u2019ve been involved\nin have been preparation\nfor Welcome, helping\nselect the new Dean for\nthe Faculty of Natural\nSciences, acting as a\nstudent rep in various\nmeetings, and \u201cfirefighting\u201d for the Union\nwhenever something\nurgent comes up.\nIn terms of welcome, I\nwas fortunate enough to\nbe able to give introductory speeches to all the\nnew first year undergrads,\nas well as separate talks\non Saturday alongside\nShervin [Sabeghi,\nthe Deputy President\n(Welfare)] for those living\noutside halls and taught\nmaster\u2019s students.\nAbout the Dean, two\nweeks ago, the Provost\nasked me to provide a list\nof student representatives\nto be involved in the recruitment process: undergraduates and postgraduates from across natural\nsciences. These students\nand I met the shortlisted\ncandidates, some internal\nand external, for \u201cconversational interviews,\u201d\nand passed our comments\nback to the Provost\nahead of this week\u2019s final\ninteview panels.\nFelix: What are your\nmain plans for the\nyear?\nAPS: We\u2019ve got a lot of\nbig stuff coming up this\nyear. This term, the Union\nwill be entering into negotiations with the College\nregarding the price of rent\nin halls. Once we have a\nclear timeline for these\nnegotiations, we\u2019ll be\nbringing options asking\nUnion Council how to\nproceed.\nUnion Council is the\nunion\u2019s decision-making\nbody, made up of elected\nstudent representatives.\nAbhijay noted that the\nmeetings are public, and\nimplored students to\nattend.\nAPS: Everyone should\ncome along and make their\nvoice heard, and have a\nsay in the decisions being\nmade on their behalf.\nAPS: In terms of other big\nstuff, Fifi [Henry, Deputy\nPresident (Finance &\nServices)] and I will be\nrenegotiating for the\nblock grant we receive\nfrom College, which\nmakes up around 70% of\nour budget. We\u2019ll also be\nwriting a new three-year\nstrategy, a very boring\nname for something\nimportant \u2013 deciding\nwhat we want to do next\nand where we want to\nbe in 3 years\u2019 time. The\nprocess around this will\nbe led by myself and the\nmanaging director of the\nUnion, Jarlath O\u2019Hara.\nAll of these things happen\nonce every few years,\nand each has coincided\nthis year. Getting through\nthese things, as well as my\nmanifesto points, will take\nmost of my year.\nAbhijay Sood, the Union President // ICU\n\n"

There\nhad been heavy rainfall\nintermittently throughout the day, affecting\nthe entire campus and\ncausing disruption at the\nWelcome Fair.\nStudents in the library\nat the time reported seeing\nwater flowing down\nthe walls of level one,\nimplying that the source\nof the water was on an\nupper floor. There were\nalso large pools of water\nthat made their way into\nthe library caf\u00e9, although\nfrom on-scene discussions\nit appears that the cause of\nthis is distinct from that of\nthe library flood.\nMany cleaning staff\nwere on-scene, using\nhoovers to get rid of the\nwater, as well as paper\ntowels and sandbags.\nMany seemed nonplussed\nat the carnage, surprised\nthat the heavy rainfall had\nbeen sufficient to cause a\nshutdown of the library,\nand informing Felix\nreporters that the carpets\nupstairs were currently\nbeing shampooed. Students in the library caf\u00e9\ndid not appear to mind the\nwater \u2013 many sat down on\nchairs in the midst of the\npool, forcing staff to ask\nthem to move in order to\nclean up.\nThis was the first time in\nseveral years that an event\nlike this has occurred \u2013\nunplanned closures of the\nlibrary are very rare.\nAccording to an official\nstatement from Chris\nBanks, the Assistant\nProvost (Space) and Director of Library Services,\nthe affected areas were\nthe second floor and main\nentrance. Neither appear\nto have suffered any\nlong-term damage, but the\ncollege will \u201ccontinue to\nmonitor the situation for\nany remedial works that\nmay be required.\u201d\n\u201cWe have already\ninvested heavily in\nstrengthening our disaster\nand emergency communication plans, and will be\nreviewing all actions taken\nduring this incident.\u201d\nNo staff or students\nwere harmed.

My first work\nwas an illustrated\nnarrative involving a\ncouple of aliens on the\nmoon kissing and proceeding to have \u201cseks\u201d.\nMy second was a series\nof short stories centred\naround Dophilip, a plucky\ndolphin who had to navigate problems such as\nplayground bullying and\nthe astronomical cost of\ncollege textbooks \u2013 don\u2019t\nworry, a celebrity shark\nhappened to find out\nabout Dophilip\u2019s woes\nand saved the day with the\nmagic power of having\nlots of money. What I\u2019m\ntrying to say, apart from\nhaving a desperate need\nfor therapy and a full\npsychological work-up,\nis that my talents lay in\nthe field of Creative Arts.\nAnd yet I found myself at\nImperial. God has a cruel\nsense of irony.\nI attempted to keep\nup my passion, doing\na Horizons course in\nCreative Writing and\nparticipating in National\nNovel Writing Month\n(NaNoWriMo) when\ntime (and a stockpile of\nRed Bull) permitted, but\nthose side-hustles left\nme unfulfilled. It wasn\u2019t\nuntil my BSc year that I\nwrote my first piece for\nFelix and I think it may\nhave been the best thing\nto happen to me since I\ndiscovered the magic of\nrunning my hands under\na cold tap before making\nshortcrust pastry. In a\nmisguided attempt to\nimpress a crush, I agreed\nto accompany him to a\nmedical conference, the\npress tickets generously\nprovided by Felix for\nthe low, low price of an\n800 word review. Not\nonly was it the perfect\nromantic venture, but it\nalso turned out to be the\nperfect opportunity to\nkeep me writing while\nexposing myself to new\nexperiences. Unfortunately, those experiences did\nnot involve a Pinterest\nwedding with the man\nof my dreams nor did it\ninvolve any level of physically exposing myself (it\u2019s\nnot harassment if it\u2019s for\nlove). Recently, I heard\nhe\u2019s settled down, that\nwhen you can have free\npress tickets, a constant\nstream of emails to send,\nand reviews to edit the shit\nout of? Dying alone on a\ndeathbed made of Felix\npapers I\u2019ve contributed to\nand edited for can also be\nsomething to aspire to.\nWhile my quest for\ntrue love may continue\nad infinitum, your quest\nto find reviews for the\nlatest London shows\nand Arts-related opinion\npieces ends here. If you\nwant to get involved,\ndrop us a line at arts.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk or\njoin our Facebook group\nFelix Arts 2019/20. Who\nknows, we might be able\nto set you up on a perfect\ndate-night experience!\nGod knows Imperial\nstudents need all the help\nthey can get in this area\n[We can neither guarantee romantic success nor\ntake any responsibilities\nfor the results of your\nElectro Swing and Cabaret...\nI\nattended the\nS o u t h b a n k\nUnderbelly festival\nthis weekend to watch\nthe Electro Swing Project\nperform a cabaret. I went\nwith the expectation that\nI would witness a cabaret\nof a quality that matched\nits rather hefty ticket price\nof \u00a318.50. What I got was\nthe stuff of nightmares,\nexcept that my nightmares\nare better rehearsed.\nOne juggler dropped\nmore balls than a classful\nof teenage boys; not one,\nbut two singers couldn\u2019t\nhit a note if it was the\nside of a barn door, and\nthe ringmaster couldn\u2019t\nhold an audience if it was\nnailed to their hand. Two\nfemale dancers appeared\nand disappeared on stage\nat random, briefly occupying the platform to perform aerobics or deposit\nprops. Both were dressed\nin various outfits clearly\nselected to titillate the au-dience, but unfortunately,\nboth held a fixed rictus\ngrin that suggested they\nwere wondering where\ntheir trousers had disappeared to.\nIn the advertisements\nmade for the show, live\nmusic was promised.\nThis was provided in the\nform of a saxophonist\nand a drummer and the\naforementioned singers.\nThe saxophonist spent\nthe whole performance\nstrutting about the stage,\nbarely scrambling around\nthe licks in Glenn Miller\u2019s\nIn the mood before ruining Eurythmics\u2019 Sweet\nDreams by improvising\nover the top of it. I would\nforgive the probably-com-petent drummer, except\nhe seemed to be enjoying himself and I wasn\u2019t.\nThere was a moment\nwhen the ringmaster and\nthe drummer performed\na nice call and response\nwith tap dancing. It was a\nshining light in an otherwise miserable attempt at\ncabaret.The worst part of\nthe event was the misla-belling it as electro swing.\nThe music, such as it was,\nwas mostly just remixed\npop classics with the bass\nturned up too loud.\nA disappointing\nevening was made even\nmore disappointing by the\nprice of the food available\nat the festival. \u00a35 for oven\nchips is enough even to\nmake a seasoned capitalist\nwince and, in the end, I sat\nthrough the indignity of\nthe performance hungry\nand thoroughly miserable.\nFrustratingly, even\nthough the performance\nwas terrible, members of\nthe audience seemed determined to have a good\ntime. I had the pleasure of\nwatching two rhythmically challenged gentlemen\nclapping alternately out of\ntime with the music on the\ndemand of the ringmaster.\nAn older gentleman was\nso fixated on the scantily\nclad aerobics class that he\nprobably wouldn\u2019t have\nnoticed if his wife left\nhim. The ringmaster was\nable to draw a cheer from\nthe crowd even when the\nfire-dancer couldn\u2019t light\nhis sword on fire. Humanity regularly disappoints\nme.\nI suggest going to see\nthis show if you are planning on having an aneu-rysm.\nARTS\nSyon Lee\nArts Editor\nSyon finds true love at last... with Felix // Isabelle Zhang\n\u201cI would be\nsad, but now\nI\u2019m Arts editor\u201d\nCaba-right or caba-wrong?\nARTS\nCharles Titmuss\nComment Editor\nWhere?

In\nthe meantime, hryvna\u2019s\npositions against euro\nhas strengthened as well,\nand is expected to rise\neven more as a result of\nnew round of quantitative\neasing that was announced\nrecently (see Figure 4 &\n5).\nLastly, for every\nemerging economy the\nrelationships that the\ncountries\u2019 leaders build\nwith the International\nMonetary Fund and the\nWorld Bank are crucial,\nas their budgets usually\ndirectly depend on credits\nFigure 4.

First of all, we still\ndon\u2019t know who Zelensky\nreally is as a President,\nand what is his live action\nplan. Indeed, there has\nbeen a lot of talk about a\nneed for industrial development and elimination\nof corruption, but for now\nit is still more words than\naction. Secondly, there\nis still on-going war in\nEastern Ukraine, and\nalthough both sides are\ncurrently in the state of\ntemporary (and honestly,\nvery shaky) peace, the\nconflict can flame in a\nmatter of weeks, thus\nlargely affecting the potentially stable economic\noutlook of Ukraine.\nTo conclude, the\noverall investment landscape looks encouraging\nnow, but follow the environment carefully after\ninvesting \u2013 it can substantially change shape any\ntime.\nFRIDAY, 4TH\nOCTOBER, 2019 FELIX\n\n"

Hopefully, some of\nyou managed to make use\nof the ten minutes of sunshine at Welcome Fair and\njoin some clubs, societies,\nor projects.\nThis week\u2019s column is\nabout mascots, traditions,\nand rivalries, of which the\nRSMU has many. If you\nvisited the RSMU stand\nat either the International\nStudents Fair on Sunday\nor the Welcome Fair on\nTuesday, you will have\nseen a giant brass mining\nlamp. This lamp is our\npride and joy: the Davy.\nThree feet tall, with a\nweight of 60-70kg, this\nstill functional mining\nlamp allegedly has teeth\nmarks in it from when a\npassionate Miner attempted to lift it this unusual\nway (not recommended).\nThe Davy was acquired\nby the RSMU at some\nunknown point in time\nand is now our main\nmascot. We even have\na role on our committee\ncalled Davy Bearer, who\nis tasked with keeping the\nDavy safe and stealing\nthe other Constituent\nUnion mascots: Theta (the\nRCSU\u2019s 8-foot-long ther-mometer), the Spanner\nand Bolt (the CGCU\u2019s\ngiant spanner and a bolt,\nmodelled after those\nused in Tower Bridge)\nand some weird chicken\ncostume (the ICSMSU\u2019s\nbright yellow phoenix\ncostume). This tradition\nis known as \u2018mascotry\u2019\nand keeps the Constituent\nUnion rivalries burning.\nEach Constituent Union\nalso has motor mascots,\nmaintained by the associated Motor Club (which\nanyone can join). These\nvehicles can often be seen\nferrying students between\nlocations or on display\nat events. The RSMU is\nproud to be represented by\nClementine II, a Morris\n1-Ton Truck acquired by\nthe RSMU in 1960, while\nthe RCSU has Jez, a 1916\nDennis N-type fire engine,\nand the CGCU has Bo\u2019.\nBut by far the RSMU\u2019s\nfiercest rivalry is with\nthe Camborne School of\nCity of London Crest on a lampost in London. Together with 12\nLivery Companies the City of London Corporation founded the City & Guilds\nCollege // CGCU\n\u201cThe\nconstituent\ncollege system\nat Imperial has\na number of\ndisadvantages\u201c\n\u201cThis is where\nthe CGCU\nprovides a\nmore local\nfeeling of\nidentity\u201d\n32\nyour name. These are\ninternationally recognised\nand only applicable to\nthose who graduate from\nCity and Guilds (not just\nImperial). The Constituent Union system, perhaps\na mere quirk to you now,\nMines, part of the University of Exeter. Every\nyear, hundreds of RSMU\nmembers take part in a\nweekend of sport, either\nas spectators or players.\nThe \u2018Bottle Match\u2019 is\nheld alternately between\nLondon and Cornwall\nevery February. All our\nsports teams compete\nfor their own trophies,\nwith the rugby match\nfinishing off two days of\nfixtures to win the titular\n\u2018Bottle\u2019!

It is\nabsolutely crucial\nto creating the atmosphere\nin a film \u2013 films would\nsimply not be the same\nwithout it. This is accentuated when the music is\nlive: somehow, live music\nhas the ability to lend an\nindescribable, tangible\npower to a film. This was\nvery much the case for\nthe screening of 1980s hit\n\u2018Star Wars: The Empire\nStrikes Back (EpisodeV)\u2019.\nPart of the Royal Albert\nHall\u2019s \u2018Films In Concert\u2019\nrunning till December\n2019, the series gives\nthe audience a chance to\nexperience classic films\nwith a live orchestra\naccompaniment, all in\nthe glorious surroundings\nof Royal Albert Hall.\nOne may not necessarily\nexpect live music to add\nthat much to the film (after\nall, the music is already in\nthe film, right?) but one\nwould be most pleasantly\nsurprised.\nWhen the Philharmonia\nOrchestra took to the stage\nand started playing John\nWilliam\u2019s famous opening\ntheme, the familiar music\nfilled the 8000-strong hall\nand smiles found their\nway onto our faces. There\nwas something simply\nmagical as the orchestra\nrecreated the Oscar-winning soundtrack right in\nfront of our eyes. The\nmusic filling our ears\ncalled to mind the emotional nostalgia of the\noriginal trilogy, drawing\nthe audience more into the\niconic film: we laughed,\nheld our breath, and\nbreathed sighs of relief as\none.\nIt was fascinating\nto see all the different\ninstruments involved in\nthe recreation of the Oscar-winning soundtrack.\nThe 6 trombones led the\nmenacing Darth Vader\ntheme, whilst the violins\nlent a sweet lilting voice\nin the tender moments.\nNeedless to say, the full\norchestra passionately\ngiving it their all really\nadded to the beauty of\nevery moment.\nCoordinating a live\nsoundtrack with the\nfilm as it plays is a real\nchallenge, for the music\nmust peak at the right\nmoment: a moment too\nsoon and the suspense\nand emotion may be lost.\nThe Philharmonia Orchestra did a phenomenal\njob of ensuring that the\ntimings were perfect \u2013 an\nimpressive feat indeed.\nConductor Dirk Brosse,\naided by visual cues\nfrom the tablet screen on\nhis conductor\u2019s stand,\nensured that every entry\nwas precise to the second.\nI was impressed by the\nability and concentration\nof both the orchestra and\nconductor to play from\nthe starting \u201820th Century\u2019\nsign to the end credits\n(not to mention the sheer\nquantity of music!) with\nnary a note out of place.\nThe only small detraction was the quality of\nthe sound projection. The\ndialogue and other audio\n(sans music) were projected from the original film\nrecording. Whilst overall\nacceptable, the relative\nlevels of the sounds were\noccasionally slightly\nskewed. Blaster gunfire\nwas sometimes muted,\nand certain characters\u2019\nvoices were jarringly loud\nwhereas others had us\nstraining to make out the\nwords.\nOverall, \u2018Star Wars:\nThe Empire Strikes Back\nin Concert\u2019 made for a\nmost enjoyable evening,\nhighlighting the beauty of\nthe epic soundtrack while\ntaking the audience on\na sentimental trip down\nmemory lane together.\nFurther, the quality and\nskill of the orchestra is to\nbe commended: they did a\nfantastic job in replicating\nthe moments of tension\nand sweetness, more than\na recorded soundtrack\never could. I would\nthoroughly recommend a\nfilm with a live concert\nto everyone \u2013 it will not\nbe an experience that you\nwill forget.\nThe \u2018Films In Concert\u2019\nseries, presented by the\nRoyal Albert Hall, continues with \u2018Skyfall\u2019 (4-5\nOctober), \u2018Baahubali\u2019(19\nOctober), \u2018Blade Runner\u2019\n(25 October), \u2018Harry\nPotter and the Goblet of\nFire\u2019(1-3 November), and\n\u2018E.T.\u2019(8 December).\nYou love the movie, you love the music, take it all to the next level and see it in all it\u2019s glory at the Royal Albert Hall.\nThe classic movie brought to life in concert // Royal Albert Hall\nARTS\nElizabeth Thong\nArts Writer\nWhere?

His appointment was in June,\nshortly before students\nleft for summer.\nThe Advancement\ndivision, consisting of 80\nstaff, manages all aspects\nof alumni relations. This\nincludes supporting networks of alumni across\nthe world, creating events\nfor them to attend, and\nliaising with various\nsupporting groups. Predominantly, it features\nfundraising for the college\nas a core activity. In Michael\u2019s words:\n\u201cThe function of Advancement is mobilising\npeople and funds for the\nmission of the college. We\nrun the entire graduation\nevent, as well as institutional events like inaugural lectures, launching\ninitiatives we\u2019ve raised\nfunds for. We also facilitate small gatherings of\nalumni across the globe \u2013\nwhich are really important\nnetworking and mentoring\nevents for them.\u201d\nAdvancement also\nhandles alumni communications \u2013 such as the\nImperial magazine \u2013 and\nfacilitates consultation\nwith alumni on college\nevents, such as the sale of\nSt. Mary\u2019s.\nLast year, charitable\ndonations raised \u00a365\nmillion for the college,\nwhich is essential for\nsupporting students and\nfaculty as well as the\nphysical infrastructure of\nthe college \u2013 needs that\nare often not supported by\nother income streams such\nas sponsored research or\neven other industry con-nections. The core concept\nis philanthropy, rather\nthan financial investment,\nwith private funding for\nthe university sourced\nfrom the community it has\ncreated.\nTypically, these donations are \u2018ringfenced\u2019:\nthey are given in support\nof a specific issue the\nalum in question is passionate about, rather than\nfreely invested by the\ncollege. This means that\nthe funds generally funnel\ndirectly into benefitting\nresearch \u2013 or students, via\ndonations for scholarships\nand bursaries. Recent examples include donations\nto the construction of\nWhite City: \u00a325 million\nfrom alum Marit Mohn\ntoward the building for\nthe School of Public\nHealth to support research\ninto healthcare for young\npeople, and \u00a340 million\nfrom alum Sir Michael\nUren to the Biomedical\nEngineering Research\nHub due to his personal\npassion for integrated\ninterdisciplinary research.\nCharitable fundraising\nhas been a staple of US\nuniversity finances for a\nlong time, but in recent\nyears has begun to migrate\nacross the Atlantic to the\nUK. Here, universities\nhave a \u201chybrid\u201d style of\nfunding between public\nand private sources. This\nis, in Michael\u2019s view, the\nright balance to have.\n\u201cIn America, it has\ngone way too much to the\nprivate side; public unis\nthere are barely funded\nby the state. They rely\nso heavily on private\nfunding, on tuition, and\non earned income that\nthey lose some of the idea\nof their public mission \u2013\nwhich is sad to see, and\nI\u2019d hate to see it happen in\nthe UK.\u201d\nThe lack of public\nfundingmeansthatstudent\nhigh on Michael\u2019s priority\nlist \u2013 \u201cevery student is a\nfuture alum, and I love\nthat generational connec-tion. We\u2019re increasingly\nlooking to focus on fundraising for student support\nthrough scholarships and\nbursaries, which is a need\nfor the college. For me,\nit\u2019s about the people.\u201d\nMeanwhile, he says,\nmany other European\ncountries are still introducing a push toward\nfundraising in conjunction\nwith state funding \u2013\nthough there\u2019s a reticence\nin some areas, which\nhe attributes to a higher\nproportion of their income\nbeing from the state and\na resulting hesitance to\nintroduce private sources\nof income.\nMichael began his\ncareer in the US himself,\nworking on funds and\nthen with admissions at\nAntioch University. He\nmoved to Dublin City\nUniversity Educational\nTrust as the Deputy CEO\nbecause he found the idea\nof growing philanthropic\ninfrastructure in Europe\nmore professionally ex-citing. Philanthropy as it\nis commonly understood\ntoday began in Victorian\nBritain, and originally\ngrew in the US as an emulation \u2013 but there it stayed\nand continued to blossom,\nwhile the concept died\noff in the UK between\nthe world wars. Aiding\nin the reclamation of that\nculture, and being at the\nforefront of developing its\nmodern-day equivalent,\nencouraged him to work\nin Ireland and then in\nLondon, fundraising for\nthe Royal Society\u2019s 350th\nanniversary and Kew\nGardens\u2019Breathing Planet\ncampaign.\n\u201cFor generations,\nUS universities have\nbeen mobilising private\nsupport for the work that\nthey do \u2013 so as a profes-sional, working for US\nuniversities is less inter-esting. Reclaiming and\ndeveloping a new culture\nis much more interesting\nthan just carrying on as\nit\u2019s \u2018always been done\u2019 as\npart of a big machine. You\nhave to be more creative\nas a professional, and you\nhave to have different\nkinds of conversations\nwith people.\u201d\nMichael has also\nspecifically chosen to\nwork with scientific insti-tutions, having a passion\nfor contributing to work\nthat genuinely endeavours\ntoward bettering the\nworld and describing this\nas what \u201cgets him out\nof bed in the morning\u201d.\nHe particularly enjoyed\nworking at Kew due to\ntheir work on the Millennium Seed Bank and\ndefending biodiversity;\nand additionally strongly\nsupports the work that Imperial researchers do on\nsustainability, particularly\nat Silwood Park. \u201cScience\nis a part of human endeav-our, and of our culture.\nWe need science and\nengineering to fight issues\nsuch as biodiversity and\nmass extinction.\u201d\nMichael Murphy, the new VP (Advancement) // Imperial College\nThe New Vice President (Advancement)\nFelix interviewed Michael Murphy, the VP (Advancement) appointed in June, to ask what he works on for the\ncollege, his experiences in similar roles, and why philanthropy is important for university education\n\u201cWe are\nincreasingly\nlooking to\nfocus on\nfundraising\nfor student\nsupport\nthrough\nscholarships\nand bursaries\u201d\nwelfare is disregarded in\nfavour of high tuition fees\nin order to maintain universities\u2019 income.

For\nexample, Glencore and\nVitol are commodity\ntrading companies.\nFinancial\nIntermediaries\nThese are the middlemen between two parties\nin a financial transaction.\nFor example, a financial\nintermediary can facilitate\nthe fund flow between\nissuers and investors.\nThere are many different\ntypes of financial intermediaries including mutual\nfunds, investment banks\nand commercial banks.\nInvestment banks\nprovide services such as\nunderwriting, facilitating\ninitial public offerings\n(IPOs), facilitating\nmergers and acquisitions\n(M&A) and acting as a\nbroker or financial advisor\nfor institutional clients.\nInvestment banks\nbelong to a group of\nfirms within the industry\ncommonly known as the\n\u201csell-side\u201d.\nJobs include investment\nbanking, equity research,\nsales and trading. Major\ninvestment banks include\nJPMorgan Chase,\nGoldman Sachs, Morgan\nStanley, Citigroup, Bank\nof America Merrill Lynch\nand Credit Suisse.\nMutual funds provide\nactive management of\nmoney pooled by inves-tors. The fund managers\ngenerate capital for the investors through investing\nin a variety of investment\nproducts with the anticipation to outperform the\nmarket.\nMutual funds belong\nto a group of firms within\nthe industry commonly\nknown as the \u201cbuy-side\u201d.\nJobs include portfolio/\nasset management, wealth\nmanagement, private\nequity, venture capital and\nhedge funds. Many banks\nin the sell-side also have\nthese divisions. Non-bank\ninvestment management\ncompanies include Man\nGroup, Bridgewater Associates and Schroders.\nCommercial banks\nprovide account services\nand loan services to consumers (like us) and small\nbusinesses.\nRegulators\nFederal and state governments have a myriad\nof agencies that regulate\nand oversee the financial\nmarkets. These agencies\nmonitor the behaviours of\nthe different players in the\nmarket by setting restrictions and guidelines. One\nof the most powerful and\ncomprehensive agencies\nin the US is Securities and\nExchange Commission\n(SEC). It enforces the\nfederal securities laws and\nregulates US stock ex-changes, options markets\nand exchanges. In the UK,\nthe Financial Conduct\nAuthority (FCA) has the\nresponsibility to ensure\nthe UK market functions\nwell.\nCentral Banks\nAcentral bank manages\na nation\u2019s currency,\nmoney supply, interest\nrate, oversees the commercial banking system,\nand formulates and\nimplements the nations\nmonetary policy. The\nFederal Reserve System\n, also known as the FED,\nis the central bank of the\nUS and is arguably the\nmost powerful financial\ninstitution in the world.\nDecisions made by the\ncentral banks and regulators have an impact on the\nentire financial market.\nFor example, deregulation\nin the financial industry in\nthe late 1990s, combined\nwith FED\u2019s adjustments in\ninterest rates in the 2000s,\nled to the increase in size\nand the eventual burst of\nan asset bubble, creating a\nbanking crisis in 2007 and\n2008 known as the Global\nFinancial Crisis.\nInvesting in Ukrainian debt \u2013 a remarkable opportunity\nin the negative-yield debt environment\nINVESTMENT\nIgor Fomenkov\nICIS\nInvestment Student Writer\nT\nhe current\nstate of global\nmarkets, led by\nsuch factors as\nclose-or-below zero interest rates, widely spread\nnegative-yield bonds and\napproaching slowdown\nin several major world\u2019s\neconomies, leave hardly\nany secure options that\noffer returns high enough\nto at least outweigh projected annual inflation.\nKeeping all those circumstances in mind, it is\npossibly just an ideal time\nto look at alternative, more\nprofitable (but also riski-er) forms of investments,\nand government bonds of\nan emerging economy suit\nwell enough. Although\nthere is a plethora of\ncountries that align with\nthis description, in this\narticle we want to draw\nyour attention to only one\nof them \u2013 Ukraine, that\nseems to have recovered\nfrom challenges of the\npast and now heads to a\nbrighter future.\nOn 21st April, the\nsecond tour of President\nElections in Ukraine\nhas come to an end, and\nVolodymyr Zelensky,\npreviously recognised\namong general population\nas a talented TV-comedian, was elected to be the\ncountry\u2019s leader for the\nnext five years.

It\nseems that global expectations on the Ukrainian\neconomy are rising, and\nso is the share of the\nforeign investors in its\nregional markets. So how\ndoes Zelensky\u2019s progressive policy match with\nthe economic prospects,\nand what does it mean for\npotential investors?\nLet\u2019s begin our analysis\nwith possibly the most important factor to consider\nwhen looking into any\ngovernment bond - the\ncountry\u2019s ability to pay\nits debt back, which in\nturn directly depends on\nhow stable the current\neconomic situation is.\nGDP (that is a key benchmark for any economy)\nstarts to gain further\ngrowth momentum, as the\nWorld Bank predicts 3.4%\noffering of shares to\nfinance its business\nexpansion in a similar\nmanner to how food truck\ncompany XYZ makes and\nsells sausages to cover the\nlabour cost.

The first,\nThe Father, examines the\neffects of dementia, and\nThe Mother discusses\nmiddle-aged angst and\nloneliness. This final\nplay\u2019s focus is, teen\ndepression. Nicolas, two\nyears ago a normal, smiling boy, is going through\na turbulent phase after his\nparents\u2019 separation and\nfather\u2019s new family. He\u2019s\nirritable, skipping months\nof school, lying. He moves\nbetween his mother\u2019s and\nfather\u2019s house trying to\nfind a place where he feels\ncomfortable and wanted,\nbut there are only so many\noptions. At some point, it\nseems Nicolas is going to\nhave to take more drastic\nactions.\nA hundred minutes\nwith no interval seems\nlike It could potentially\ndrag on in places, but I\ncan assure you that my\nattention did not waver\nthroughout the entire\nplay. Even at times where\nthere was no talking, there\nwas always something\nhappening on the stage.\nNicolas scribbling across\nthe wall, throwing stuff\nacross the room. All this\nhelped us to comprehend\nwhat his thoughts are,\nand serve as a visual\nrepresentation of what\nwas going on inside his\nhead. This was particularly enhanced due to the\notherwise clean, modern\nParisian set design by\nLizzie Clachan.\nThe most notable\nperformance comes from\nLaurie Kynaston, who\nplays Nicolas. He impressively encapsulates the\nessence of a lost teenager;\ndisillusioned, erratic, ni-hilistic. He draws you in,\nand while we never really\nunderstand him, we feel\nfor him. John Light also\ndoes a brilliant job as the\nfather, and his strange mix\nof caring and uncaring,\nguilty and nonchalant.\nScenes between the two of\nthese compelling characters were by far the most\ngripping.\nAmanda Abbington\nand Amaka Okafor, as the\nmother and Pierre\u2019s new\nwife respectively, are also\nstrong characters, though\noutshone by Kynaston.\nThis may simply be due to\nthe way characters themselves are written and the\nway they are incorporated\ninto the play rather than\nthe acting talent (the\nmother in particular seems\nto be under-written by\nZeller, drifting in and out\nrandomly and not really\nfitting in seamlessly).\nBut both nonetheless do\na great job in terms of\nacting, and of supporting\nthe work as a whole.\nUltimately, there is no\nclear-cut explanation for\nthe way Nicolas is acting,\nand he remains a bit of\nan enigma throughout\nthe entire play, from start\nto finish. There is no\nanalysis and exploration\nof the \u2018why\u2019, it is simply\na presentation of depression and its frightening\nrepercussions, not only\non Nicolas himself, but\non the entire family. The\nlack of resolution and\nunderstanding perhaps\nmakes the whole situation\neven more alarming and\nheartrending. I commend\nthe actors for being able\nto perform an incredibly\nemotionally draining\npiece, night after night,\nand I highly recommend\ngoing to see this if you\nwant to be as awed by the\ntalent as I was.\nFaith, Hope and Charity\nI\nn a community\ncentre, Hazel (Cecilia\nNoble) is preparing\na hot lunch for those\nin need in the community.\nMason (Nick Holder) has\njust taken over the direction of the choir, he wants\nto give back. Beth (Susan\nLynch), who is having\nlunch with her friends,\nis fighting the social services to get her daughter\nout of foster care. There\nare leaks in the building.\nWhat will the future give?\nYou may pick this play\nout of curiosity, because of\nthe rhythm of the title, its\npositive notes or because\nyou read Alexander Zeldin\u2019s\nprevious critically acclaimed\nplays Beyond Caring and\nLOVE. You may also pick\nthis play because you\u2019ve\nrealised how privileged you\nare and want to be more\naware of the inequalities in\nthe country you are living in.\nIn any case, if you end up\nin this room, you will experience something powerful,\ndifferent from any other play.\nIt is very uncomfortable at\nfirst with lots of simple,\nsmall-talk dialogues, very\nun-play-like. The physical\nappearance of the actors\nis not one that makes you\ndream. It is shocking at first,\nthe screaming uneasiness in\nthe movements of the char-acters, how small they are\ntrying to make themselves,\nhow vulnerable they are, is\nthe opposite of the charisma\nyou usually come across.\nYou wonder if they are not\nexaggerating, overacting\nthe class difference in the\nway they take as it seems a\nbit different to what you are\nused to. The room is entirely\nlit and you can watch the\npublic. The difference is\nstriking, well dressed, con-centrated, relaxed people,\nlooking just as uncomfortable as you are feeling.\nThe stage is amazingly\nrealistic, with rain falling\noutside the window of a\ndecrepit council-building.\nYou cannot escape the story\nthat is unfolding, you are so\nclose to them now, they sit\nwithin the first row on seats\nleft purposefully empty.\nThe paths of people from\ndifferent backgrounds cross\nhere, touching on homeless-ness, mental illness, old age,\nyouth and family. There are\nsome funny moments, there\nis a song and melodious\nhope that makes you smile.\nIt\u2019s amazing the resilience\nof these characters, how\nthey care for each other. Yet\nsociety categorizes people\nthat have been through the\ncare system or the prison\nsystem, making it harder for\nthem to fit in as adults. There\nis no simple solution to shattered people but the weight\nof taking care of your single\nmom at 16 is chest-tighten-ing. The silence of some of\nthe characters, the mystery\nof their past and present\nemphasises the hardship and\ntheir strength. Then there\nare the ones that are missed,\nwhose names are part of the\nchorus of the characters\u2019\nlife but ironically embody\nthe absence of a positive\nfuture. The characters don\u2019t\ncomplain, they get angry and\nsad, they try their best to help\neach other. You\u2019re not sure if\ntheir sadness or their anger\nis more heart-breaking. It\nis a challenging perspective\non the social system. The\nclimax is carried by the\nastonishing performance of\nSusan Lynch and Cecilia\nNoble, drawing tears from\nthe audience and a standing\novation at the end. This play\nis a raw emotional punch in\nthe face.\nLeaving the theatre and\ngoing back to my comfortable life as an Imperial\nstudent, I think that there is\nsomething unique about this\nplay, something so impactful\nand everyone should get the\nopportunity to see it.

    "content": "Blood Wedding\nWhat Girls Are Made Of\nP\nrior to seeing this\nproduction, I was\nworried. Having\nbeen informed\nthat the play, one of\nLorca\u2019s \u201ctrilogy of the\nSpanish earth\u201d, had been\nreimagined to take place\nin Ireland, I thought I was\nin for a brutal disappoint-ment. However, I was in\nfor a pleasant surprise.\nThe exact location of\nthe play is uncertain, but\nultimately irrelevant. Not\nonly is the play not necessarily set in Ireland, after\nmuch soul-searching, I\u2019ve\ncome to the realisation\nthat the Irish flair adds\nto the magic of Lorca\u2019s\nAnadulsian tragedy.\nAdapted skilfully by\nMarina Carr using her\nnative Hibernian English,\nstill spoken in parts of\nIreland, this alteration\ncould have easily been\ndistracting and confusing.\nHowever, the conversations flow with such\nfluency and ease that the\nproduction feels like a\nblueprint for how Lorca\u2019s\nmasterpiece should be\nperformed in English.\nAdded by the fact that the\nplay did maintain its The\ndistinct Spanish feel of the\nplay is maintained through\nthe music and spoken\npoetry - a plethora of\nSpanish music, Flamenco\nbeats and poems mostly\nperformed in Spanish. The\nblend of Irish and Spanish\nelements combine to\ncreate a mind-bogglingly\ntimeless, placeless feel.\nThis is a truly gorgeous\nproduction \u2013 no line is un-intentional; no movement\nis less than a hundred\npercent precise. The\nsimple staging never feels\nempty, and the almost-in-the-round seating plan\ncreates a sense of entrapment of the characters on\nstage. There are moments\nof absolute visual genius\nwithin the performance \u2013\nnamely when Leonardo,\nportrayed tantalisingly\nby Gavin Drea, rides an\nimaginary horse, gliding\nthrough the air, hooked\non a harness from the\ntop of the stage. The\nmusic also adds greatly\nto the performance. The\nefficient use of music\ncreates a constant sense of\nurgency, and the wailings\nof The Moon, expertly\nplayed by Thalissa\nTeixeira, although for\nthe most part in Spanish,\nfeel emotionally charged\nin all the right moments.\nTeixeira\u2019s voice is a\ncomplete marvel, filling in\nthe auditorium to the brim\nevery time she opened\nher mouth. But perhaps\nthe most valuable asset of\nthe play is its wonderful\nportrayal of the Mother,\nabsolutely brilliantly performed by Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9,\nbuilding and dissipating\ntension with razor-sharp\nprecision.\nThis production is\nbound to be polarising \u2013\nsome, like me, will marvel\nat what Ya\u00ebl Farber, the\ndirector, was able to\nachieve through such an\nunconventional approach.\nHowever, it is not less\nthan probable that purists\nwill leave The Young Vic\nfeeling slightly attacked.\nThe only criticism I can\nthink of about this masterful production of Blood\nWedding is that I would\nhave liked to see a more\nfully realised collection\nof the brutality of Lorca\u2019s\noriginal play. Farber\u2019s\nperhaps intentionally\ntame version, comes just\nslightly short of provoking\ndiscomfort in the viewers.\nOverall, though, regardless of one\u2019s familiarity\nwith Lorca\u2019s work, most\nviewers will leave the\ntheatre with something\nto take away from this\nevocative production.\nW\nhat Girls\nAre Made\nOf is a\nd e e p l y\nintrospective and yet\nrefreshingly playful\nperformance written by\nand starring Cora Bissett:\nthe (almost famous)\nlead singer of the 90s\nindie-band \u2018Darlingheart\u2019.\nFresh from its sold-out\nrun in the Edinburgh\nFringe and now being\nperformed in the Soho\nTheatre, Bissett breathes\nher teenage diary to life\nand delicately charts her\njourney. We see her as a\n17-year-old girl living in a\nsmall Scottish town, high\non youth and ambition,\nand watch her transform\ninto a shimmering singer,\npartying and touring the\nUK with Radiohead.\n\u2018What Girls are Made\nof\u2019 is a fun, exciting\nmusical \u2013 it will have\nyou nodding your head\nand humming the songs\non the tube back home.\nHowever, underneath its\nfun, gig-style delivery\nremains Bissett\u2019s poignant\nreflection. The narrative\nis constructed thought-fully, with themes of\nparenthood, loss, betrayal\nand confusion threaded\nthroughout. Bissett\u2019s\nsinging is powerful,\nher stage presence is\ncommanding, and yet the\nmost moving aspect of her\nperformance is her ability\nto reflect. The audience\ndoesn\u2019t just witness a girl\ngrowing up and becoming\na singer. Far from a\nsimplistic coming-of-age\narc, \u2018What Girls Are\nMade Of\u2019 exhibits the\ncomplex iterative process\nof reflection undertaken\nby Bissett as she digests\nher own experiences. The\nresult is stunning: we see\nthe various forms Bissett\nhas been incarnated in\nthroughout her life. We\nsee her as not just as the\nwoman in front of us, but\nas the girl she once was\nand the woman she will\nlater grow up to be.\nThe songs and performance are fast-paced.\nScattered throughout the\nballads and rock anthems,\nBissett creates moments\nof both comedic and emotional gold, presenting\na true testament to her\nwriting and versatility on\nstage. Accompanying,\nand by no means overshadowed by, Bisset is\nher dynamic 3-person\nlive band. The cast put\non an energetic show\nwith singing, guitar solos,\nfantastic drumming and\nhilarious impersonations\nof the eccentric people\nBissett meets along her\njourney. I must add that\ntheir Scottish accents do\nmake some jokes and\nlyrics hard to decipher,\ndespite this, the cast will\nstill have you laughing\nout loud, singing along\nand (at times) shedding a\ntear or two.\nThe Soho Theatre\noffers an intimate venue\nfor the performance. The\nroom is filled with light\ntheatre smoke, thin neon\ntubes outline the stage\nand the cast are wearing\nexactly what you would\nexpect them to wear if\nthey were rehearsing in\ntheir basement. The set\ndesign is simple, but rather\nthan appearing reductivist\nthe set-up feels charming\nand familiar, resonant of\na student union or school\nproduction.\nPrior to seeing this\nshow I had no knowledge\nof Cora Bissett, of her\nband or any of her songs.\nDespite this, the cast\u2019s\nenergy and Bissett\u2019s\nheart-warming vulnerability create a truly fantastic\nshow with a powerful\nmessage of self-reflection\n\u2013 5 stars, a show not to be\nmissed.\nCora Bissett\u2019s Bildungsroman - gig style // Mihaela Bodlovic\nA dark story of passion and revenge // Marc Brenner\nISSUE 1728\nFELIX\n16\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nOzbil Dumenci\nArts Editor\nWhere?

Through\nall the noise of hyperactive toy adverts and shows\nabout poorly-dressed sea\nsponges, the only thing\nthat I would latch onto was\ncharacters such as Usagi\nfrom Sailor Moon, her big\neyes, crazy hair, and glorious tri-tone sailor outfit a\nreminder of a culture I had\nleft behind.

Later\non, I stumbled upon my\ndad\u2019s collection of Ranma\n\u00bd, Rumiko Takahashi\u2019s\ngender-bending comedy\nepic, which helped inform\nmy conception of identity\nand gender itself. This\nculture-spanning, char-acter-defining property\nof manga was the focus\non the British Museum\u2019s\nmanga exhibition which\nopened at the end of May.\nThe introductory\nexhibits were mainly\nused as a way of orienting\nthose unfamiliar to the\nmanga format, offering\nhelpful hints such as panel\nreading order and even a\nbeginner\u2019s guide to the\n\u201cgrammar\u201d of manga\nfrom the book Giga Town:\nalbum of manga symbols.\nThese symbols, called\n\u201cmanpu\u201d (or mampu depending on romanisation)\nare so embedded into the\nvocabulary of most manga\nreaders that it was actually\nrefreshing to be offered\na semiotic analysis of\niconography that was\npreviously processed subconsciously (here\u2019s a free\ndissertation idea, you\u2019re\nwelcome). What followed\nwere sections describing\neverything manga related,\nfrom history to genre to\nwider applications. These\nwere exemplified with\nawe-inspiring original\nhand-drawn images from\npopular manga, some of\nwhich were so expertly\ncrafted they could pass as\ndigital renderings even at\nclose viewing.\nAs expected of a British\nMuseum offering, there\u2019s\nan emphasis on history,\nwith key artists such as\nTezuka Osamu (\u201cGod of\nManga\u201d and creator of\nAstro Boy) and Hokusai\n(famed ukiyo-e painter\nand printmaker) taking\nkey mentions. Fortunately, a whole diverse cast of\nother mangaka also get a\nchance to shine, with their\nkey works on display and\na panel introducing them\nin flashcard format. Not\nonly did we get photos and\nplace of work, we were\nalso treated to quotes from\nthe artists, such as Chiba\nTetsuya (Tomorrow\u2019s Joe)\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want people\nto read your manga, you\nwant them to feel it\u201d;\ninteresting facts, such\nas Akika Higashimura\u2019s\n(Princess Jellyfish) love\nof growing succulents;\nand even their blood\ngroup. The inclusion of\nblood typing may seem\nlike an odd piece of extraneous information, but for\nanyone who has ever read\na manga character bio, it\nis a piece of information\nthat comes as easily to\nthe Japanese character\nmake-up as star sign or\nfavourite food. And like a\nstar sign or favourite food,\nthe blood typing is considered an important indicator of personality as based\non the \u201cJapanese Blood\nType Personality Theory\u201d\n(watch Ketsuekigata-kun!\nfor more information).\nThe only major source\nof disappointment of this\nexhibition came down to\nthe lack of space. Touted\nas the \u201clargest exhibition\nof manga ever to take\nplace outside of Japan\u201d,\none would expect an\nendless pavilion of manga\ncharm. Unfortunately, the\nexhibition hall was not\nthe size such a collection\nwarranted. Add to that\nthe immense popularity\nof the exhibition and\nthe \u201clargest exhibition\u201d\nsuddenly feels positively\nclaustrophobia-inducing.\nIt\u2019s safe to say that any\nstatement relating to size\nis really a matter of relativity and I should know\nbetter by now than to be\ndrawn in by such boasts.\nHowever, given the space\nlimitations, the exhibition\ndid remarkably well in\nfitting in all a long-time\nfan or a beginner would\nwant to see.\nThese exhibitions can\noften come off as rather\nentry-level, especially\nwhen this exhibition\nwas designed to capture\nthe widest audience as\npossible. And play to the\ncrowds it did. Not only\nwas there a whole section\ndedicated to Studio\nGhibli, there was also a\nlife-sized titan head from\nAttack on Titan, and a\nlibrary of manga volumes\nto peruse at your leisure.\nHowever, the true strength\nof the exhibition was\nits readiness to proudly\ndisplay the often bizarre\nand overlooked aspects\nof manga culture, from\nmangaka blood typing\nto original, hand-painted\nShintomi Theatre stage\ncurtains. These smaller\ntouches and more obscure\nasides, like big eyes and\ncrazy hair in my younger\nyears, were helpful reassurances that I had found\nmy space. Sorry mum, it\nlooks like you\u2019re going\nto end up with a shut-in\nNEET pervert for a son\nand you have the British\nMuseum to thank.\nAn exploration of form, history, and culture behind a modern artform.\nImage from Golden Kamuy series // Satoru Nodwa\nARTS\nSyon Lee\nArts Editor\nWhere?

The weather was\ngreat for gliding, and the\ntemperature was incredibly high reaching over\nforty degrees centigrade\nevery day.\nThe first two days in\nIssoudun were great and\neveryone got a fantastic\namount of flying time.\nUnfortunately, on Monday\nevening one of the glider\u2019s\n(496) radio stopped\nworking. Just as we\u2019d\nfound some new fuses for\nthe radio, the next bit of\nbad luck hit us. The other\nglider\u2019s (296) starboard\naileron was damaged\nwhile being towed back to\nthe trailers, it was locked\nin the maximum position.\nTuesday\u2019s wonderful\nflying weather was not\nmonopolised on due to\nrepairs. By the end of the\nday, we managed to free\nup the aileron (although\nit still required a lengthy\ninspection to ensure air-worthiness). Thank you\nDonato, who found the\ndodgy connection! And\nthank you French technician Michel for the help!\nWe got the radio working\nagain, so 496 was good to\ngo!\nWe resumed our flying\non Wednesday full of\nnew enthusiasm and\nsome wonderful thermals\nbuilt up before a storm\nhit at 6pm. On Thursday,\nwe even got Issoudun\u2019s\nDuo Discus out, so more\npeople could go flying.\nWhat a beautiful plane!\nThankfully, the rest of\nthe tour was uneventful\napart from more and more\nstorms forming in the\nevenings which did not\ngive us much flying time.\nWe enjoyed the days at\nthe airfield a lot though,\nplaying cards, practising\nour French, playing\nfootball, enjoying delicious French baguettes\nand enjoying nice cold\nwell-earned beers in the\nevenings.\nAlthough the French\ndid not really seem to like\nus \u2018British\u2019 (Shaun was\nthe only British national\nfor most of the week)\nmuch in the beginning, we\ngot along with them very\nwell in the end.\nIn spite of the big\nand small incidents and\nscorching days, it was a\nvery enjoyable week. We\nmanaged to make the best\nout of every situation,\nand got a good amount of\nflying in the end!\nSpecial thanks to\nDonato, Nik and Antoine\nfor organising this trip, to\nGiorgos, Donato, Shaun,\nand Nik who towed the\ngliders, to everyone who\nhelped us fix the gliders\nand to our wonderful instructor Shaun who came\nto fly with us all week\nlong despite the heat.\nKabaddi Give it a Go: Sport\u2019s Editors Impression\nL\nast Wednesday\nI took part in IC\nKabaddi\u2019s Give\nit a Go session.\nBeing honest, I didn\u2019t\nreally know what I was\ngetting myself into. I had\nthe idea it was sort of a\nmix of tig (I\u2019m Scottish,\nthe English know it as\n\u2018tag\u2019or \u2018it\u2019) and wrestling/\njudo. Now I can comfortably say it\u2019s like tig - if the\naim was to gang-tackle\nthe person doing the\n\u2018tigging\u2019\u2026\nIt\u2019s very quick-paced,\nrequiring one person\nfrom the offensive team\nto \u2018raid\u2019 the defending\nteam\u2019s side of the field.\nThe raiding person has to\ntouch part of one of the\ndefending team\u2019s body\n(sort of like \u2018tigging/\ntagging\u2019 someone). Once\nthis happens the defending team attempts to stop\nthe raider getting back\nto their offensive side.\nTo stop the raider, the\ndefender grabs them and,\nessentially, tosses them\nto the floor. These are not\nthe full rules, but were the\nsimplified rules we played\nwith for the session.\nEven in this introductory session, I was able\nto appreciate the more\nthe technical side of the\ngame. There are different\nformations, extra rules,\nyou can fake opponents\nout (looking one way and\nattempting to \u2018tig\u2019 the\nother) - and the speed,\ntiming and synergy\n(please excuse that pretentious word) required\nare very impressive. As\nthe raider moves around,\nthe defending team ebbs\nand flows attempting to\nengulf the raider; in that\nsense, it is synergistic.\nKabaddi as a sport\noriginated from South\nAsia and, according to\nWikipedia, accounts of\nKabaddi appear in the\nhistories of ancient India.\nAdditionally, it\u2019s the\nUK it is quickly growing\nin popularity, with more\nand more universities\nforming teams. Imperial\nKabaddi in particular is\nextremely successful, with\nthe Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s\nteams having won five\nnational championships\nbetween them.\nWhat is perhaps most\nunique is that most people\njoining the club have never\nplayed before. There there\nare teams of different\nskill level meaning that\nit is really not at all as\nintimidating as it seems.\nAdditionally, through the\nbrief interactions I had\nwith members, they are all\nlovely. It\u2019s a very friendly\nclub, and a very fun sport.\nIf you enjoy contact sports\nand want to try something\na little different, I implore\nyou to try.

Several areas had\na chaotic start as a result.\nSome societies with electronic equipment were left\nfeeling unable to operate\ntheir stalls, and sports\nclubs on the Queen\u2019s\nLawn were soaked in the\ndeluge.

However,\nmany sports clubs on the\nQueen\u2019s Lawn and media\nsocieties on level 3 had\nrecord-breaking signups,\nand a Union statement\nclarified that there was\nactually a 6% increase in\nonline signups over the\n2018 Fair.\nCGCU societies in\nDalby were left particularly unhappy with their\nresults \u2013 and one even\nended up buying their own\ngazebo on the morning of\nthe event to try to mitigate\nthe impact. Many ended\nup not attending their\nstalls, either unable to\noperate their electronics\nwithout cover or not\nwilling to brave the rain.\nFrustration is mainly\ndirected at the lack of\na proper contingency\nplan in the event of rain.\nAlthough the measures\nput into place last-minute\nwere effective for many\nCSPs, the Union confirms\nthat it had no established\ncontingency plan \u2013\ndespite the forecast and\nthe high likelihood of rain\nin London in September.\nRoss Unwin, the ACC\nChair, commented:\n\u201cThe general mood\namong sports clubs was\npretty high spirited and\nthe fair was a success\nfor most clubs; so thanks\nstatement: \u201cAnyone who\nraised a concern with the\nUnion on the day was\nsupported.

Griffin\nhave historically choked\nin high-pressure games,\nfailing to qualify for\nWorlds last year despite\ndominating in the LCK\u2019s\nregular season, and falling\n\u201cGroup C\nfeatures 3\nof the best 6\nteams in the\ntournament:\nFNC, SKT, and\nRNG\u201d\n\u201cWorlds 2019\nmight offer\nthe most\ncompetitive\nand volatile\ntournament in\nyears\u201d\nto SKT less than a month\nago in the 2019 summer\nfinals despite placing\nthree places higher in the\nregular season. Whether\nGriffin can withstand\nG2\u2019s chaotic, assas-sin-heavy midgame-fo-cused playstyle on the big\nstage is the question on\neverybody\u2019s minds \u2013 and,\nindeed, whether they can\nswing back with their own\nsubstantial clout and skill.\nThe third team joining\nthem is Cloud 9, NA\u2019s\nthird seed \u2013 a definite\nunderdog, but one that\ngenerates fear exclusively\nat Worlds, where they\nalmost always escape\ngroups against expectations and represent NA\nwell (whether through\nmiracle or genius, often\non behalf of the unique\ncompositions constructed\nby their coach Reapered.)\nMeanwhile, other\ngroups have fallen in such\na way as to be considered\na \u2018free pass\u2019 for top teams.\nGroup B currently has\nFunPlus Pheonix, the\nLPL champions, facing\nthe LMS\u2019 J Team and the\nVCS\u2019 Gigabyte Marines\n\u2013 who famously upset\nFnatic and Immortals\nwith incredibly creative\nstrategies in 2017, rebelling against the stale meta\nat the time. Although\nsuch upsets are always\npossible, FPX (along with\nstar midlaner Doinb) have\nlooked dominant in one\nof the world\u2019s strongest\nregions \u2013 and considering\nthe LMS\u2019 devastating\nexodus of talent to the\nLPL, FPX shouldn\u2019t\nface much challenge.\nAssuming no upsets in\nthe play-in stage, the only\ncontestants that can join\nthis group are EU\u2019s or\nKR\u2019s third seeds \u2013 Splyce\nor Damwon Gaming. Only\nthe latter of these would\ngenerally be considered a\nthreat \u2013 despite Damwon\nbeing comprised of\nprimarily young rookies\nwho are untested in\ninternational waters \u2013 as\nFPX\u2019s typically Chinese\nhyper-aggressive style\nshould match up well into\nSplyce\u2019s measured scaling\ncompositions.\nGroup D gives true\nhope to NA, who have\nfallen short in international tournaments for several\nyears. Their superteam\nfirst seed, Team Liquid,\nhas been knocked out of\nthe group stage before \u2013\nand this year, they want\nto demonstrate that they\ntruly are NA\u2019s best team,\nabove C9\u2019s significantly\nbetter international\nrecord. They took down\nthe LPL\u2019s Invictus\nGaming \u2013 the 2018 world\nchampions \u2013 in the semifinal at MSI, to general\nsurprise, and now they\nwant to show it wasn\u2019t a\nfluke by dominating them\nin the group stage. IG has\nbeen underperforming\nrecently compared to\ntheir electrifying 2018\nWorlds performance, and\nis known to be a volatile\nteam \u2013 the hope is that\nthey reach top form and\ncan look to compete for\nthe title, delivering even\nmore action than Worlds\nalready promises. If both\nteams underperform, then\nhope might go to one of\nthe LMS\u2019 most famous\nteams, ahq esports, but\nwith either Splyce or\nDamwon likely to join the\ngroup and be competing\nfor the top slots, their\nchances are low. Liquid\u2019s\nhopes are also pinned to\nSplyce joining the group\nrather than Damwon\n\u2013 their by-the-book play-style with slower set-ups\nis similar to Splyce\u2019s, and\nthey can hope to simply\nout-execute on their game\nplan and in skirmishes or\nteamfights. If Damwon\njoin the group, however,\nand manage to perform\nin front of the largest\ncrowds they\u2019ve ever ex-perienced, then Liquid are\nfacing down two highly\nskilled and, importantly,\naggressive teams who will\nexploit their tendency to\ntake some time to set up\ntheir plays.\nNo matter what teams\nemerge from the group\nstage, we are guaranteed\nsome incredible perfor-mances. With the gap\n\u2018closing\u2019 between the\nEast and West in terms of\nskill, and Korea no longer\nbeing the undisputed best\nregion,Worlds 2019 might\noffer a more competitive,\nversatile, and volatile\ntournament than League\nfans have experienced in\nyears.\nThe competition this year is the most stacked for years // Riot\nT\n\n"

Thank\nGod twitter activists have\na new icon to idolise. It\u2019s\nall that this summer of\nclimate change protests\nneeded: a young, middle\nclass girl with a little bit\nof Autism and a lot of\nanger. She\u2019s untouchable,\nbut I\u2019m worried that the\nidolatry only serves to\nobscure her message.\nIf you can dodge the\nproclamations of her as a\nmessiah, or the desperate\nmudslinging from her\nopponents, you might\njust find the message she\nbroadcasted to the world\nat the UN. Which was\nsomething about climate\nchange. I think. It\u2019s\ndifficult to tell when all\nher supporters will tweet\nabout is how her opponents are tweeting about\nhow Thunberg\u2019s tweets\nare \u2018immature\u2019 and \u2018not a\ngood way to approach an\nissue as serious as climate\nchange.\u2019\nTruthfully, if I read one\nmore tweet about Thunberg\u2019s clap back at Trump\nI might vomit. However,\nthis sort of response will\nnot come as a surprise to\nanyone who has noticed\nthe recent shift in online\ndiscussion to some\nNietzschean nightmare.\nAs with many important\nissues that have come\naxe that wants grinding.\nRising sea levels are\nblamed on the rich and\nstrangled turtles are\nascribed to male fragility.\nI understand the feeling\nof impotence, but I do\nnot think that using the\nfacts of climate change\nto make these points will\ndo anything but dilute the\nmessage.\nWorryingly, this is just\nanother step in the transition from politics into en-tertainment. Interactions\nsuch as the one between\nThunberg and Trump are\nnow commonplace, and\nit\u2019s only getting worse.\nUnfortunately it\u2019s an\nincredibly useful distraction tool for leaders like\nTrump, who use social\nmedia to direct attention\nto whatever serves them\nbest. The use of social\nmedia in political discussion has brought serious\ndebate down to the level\nof reality TV. By existing\nalongside anyone\u2019s meaningless diatribe, issues that\nrequire nuanced discussion become plot points\nin a bizarre, multi-episode\nstory-arc. This is the price\nwe have paid for full democracy in debate, and we\nmust change something\nbefore politics turns into\nyet another reality show\nthat plays out on our TV\nscreens every night.\nI should mention here\nthat I fully believe that\nmore urgent action is\nneeded to mitigate the\ndamage that climate\nchange will inevitably\ncause. I also fully support\nanyone who is brave\nenough to stand in front\nof the world and bring\nthis issue to the attention\nof so many. But who\nhasn\u2019t heard of climate\nchange by now? Deniers\nhave long since become\ncartoon strawmen, occupying the same niche\nas anti-vaxxers and the\nNazis. And just like with\nmeasures were not good\nenough, she chose to\nreference very little of\nthe science that backs up\nher claims, nor did she\nprovide any solutions in\nher speech.\nDespite this, there is\nnow no denying that the\nmessage she brings is\nan important one. The\neffect human industry has\nhad on the planet is now\nundeniable. I am a huge\nfan of the urgency she\nbrings to every speech. As\nwith most bureaucracy,\nemotion might be what\nwill finally encourages\nfurther action. The facts\nare dry and boring, and\nmay no longer further\nthis movement. Protests\nand speeches of this\nnature have been all too\npeaceful, this is clear by\nthe sluggish inaction. This\nis not to say that rioting is\nthe way forward. In fact,\nviolence would be very\nbad for the image. I\u2019m\njust surprised that more\npeople aren\u2019t more angry\nwith the slothful crawl\nthat progress seems to\nmove with.\nMartin Luther King Jr\nonce denounced \u2018white\nmoderates\u2019 as the real\nenemy of progress;\nthat the greatest enemy\nwas not the Klansman,\nbut the white man who\n\u2018paternalistically set the\ntimetable for another\nman\u2019s freedom.\u2019 I think\nwe face a similar issue.\nWhat stands in the way of\nprogress is not people who\ndeny that there is an issue,\nbut those who believe that\n\u2018technical solutions\u2019 are\nenough. When framed\nlike this, the frustration\nand impotence that many\nyoung people are now\nfeeling is justified.\nGreta Thunberg // Anders Hellberg - Wikimedia\n\u201cDeniers\nhave long\nsince become\ncartoon\nstrawmen,\noccupying the\nsame niche as\nanti-vaxxers\nand the Nazis\u201d\nthe vaccine argument,\nthe goal of discussion\nhas moved away from\npersuasion and towards\nconfirming to your tribe\nthat you\u2019re one of the\n\u2018good\u2019 ones.

    "content": "MUSIC\nFRIDAY, 4TH\nOCTOBER, 2019 FELIX\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n25\nTime is a flat circle: Beatles back at No.1 after 50 years\nWhat year is this? Are we back in 1969? Should I grow a\nbeard and organise a sit-in to save the squirrels? Take\nmy bell-bottoms and my guitar down King\u2019s Road and\nhave a seance with Mick and Keith? Sadly not. But it\ndoes prove that grat art is truly timeless, and certainly\ndeserving of another in-depth look.\nMUSIC\nMartin Flerin\nMusic Editor\n\u201cThe real gems\nlie at the end...\nThey show\nwhat the band\nis truly about.\nBut also that\nthey want\nto shag the\nqueen\u201d\nT\nhis time last year\nI was writing\nan article on the\n50th anniversary\nof the White Album, and\never since I put down the\nproverbial pen I have been\nlooking forward to the\nnext one - Abbey Road.\nAs someone who believes\nthat the sun shone out\nof their Scouse arses, I\nwas quite lenient on the\nsomewhat wonky White\nAlbum, so get ready for\na litany of praise for an\nalbum that, in my opinion,\nbrings together all the best\naspects of the Beatles in\n47 minutes of rarefied\neargasm.\nWith the Beatles having\nbeen teetering on the\nedge of a breakup for the\nprevious few efforts, it is\nno surprise that most look\nat Abbey Road as the last\nproper album of the Fab\nFour\u2019s Cannon (Sorry, Let\nIt Be). In fact, it may be\nmore surprising that they\nmanaged to put out such\na coherent, if stylistically\nincongruent, album with\ntheirmultitudesofcreative\ndifferences. Doo-wop on\n\u2018Oh! Darling\u2019, sheer psychedelic wondrousness\non \u2018I Want You (She\u2019s so\nheavy)\u2019, and plushy pop\npar excellence mixed\nwith some melancholy on\n\u2018Here Comes the Sun\u2019,\nare all weapons that they\namassed in their arsenal\nthroughout their tenure\nas the world\u2019s foremost\nmusical icons. It all comes\ntogether beautifully.\nBut before diving into\nthe music, let\u2019s get the\ncover out of the way.\nAs is the case for pretty\nmuch all of their covers,\nthere are many conspiracy\ntheories concerning it - to\nno one\u2019s surprise again\nmostly about Paul being\ndead and having been\nreplaced by an exact alien\nreplica. What else could\none interpret from the\nfact that he is the only\none in the picture who\nis barefoot while ALSO\nsmoking a cigarette\u2026\nBesides, the Abbey\nRoad strut is something\nthat every tourist who\nhappens to chance on that\nparticular zebra crossing\nin St. John\u2019s Wood aims\nto recreate. Walking in\nunison, they look singularly determined, perhaps\nfor the last time before\ntheir paths take them in\ndifferent directions. And\nI am proud (YEAH I AM)\nto say that it is an image\nthat has hung above this\nauthor\u2019s personal place of\nnocturnal rest.\n\u201cOnce there was a way\nto get back homeward\n// Once there was a way\nto get back home\u201d sings\nPaul in a fragile voice\non \u2018Golden Slumbers\u2019.\nThose times have long\ngone for the fearsome\nfoursome. And so with\nthis album it is perhaps\nprudent to focus on the\nend. The medley which\nmakes up the second half\nof the album, and begins\nwith \u2018You Never Give\nMe Your Money\u2019 is one\nof their most legendary\nsong sequences. It shows\nthe band\u2019s ability to\nmake a melody, even\nthough it is composed\nof mostly \u201cunfinished\u201d\nsongs. Like the song at\nits outset, the medley as\na whole is composed of a\nmosaic of different styles.\n\u2018YNGMYM\u2019 is a song\nabout losing control of the\nband, both with regards its\nmanagement - \u201cYou never\ngive me your money //\nYou only give me your\nfunny paper // And in the\nmiddle of negotiations\n// You break down\u201d - as\nwell as personal struggles\nand tensions between the\nmembers. It is a twofold\nlook back at the times\nwhen things were easier,\nand at the dead end road\nthey found themselves on\nthen: \u201cBut oh that magic\nfeeling // nowhere to go\u201d.\nFinally, it is a goodbye to\ntheir time together \u201cOne\nsweet dream // Pick up the\nbags, get in the limousine\n// Soon we\u2019ll be away\nfrom here // Step on the\ngas and wipe that tear\naway\u201d. (I\u2019m not crying,\nyou\u2019re crying) And as the\nfinal words echo, \u201cOne\nsweet dream // came\ntrue today,\u201d the haunting\nguitar arpeggios from\n\u2018She\u2019s So Heavy\u2019 ring\nout, ushering in a nursery\nrhyme - \u201c1,2,3,4,5,6,7 //\nAll good children go to\nheaven\u201d. The oxymoronic\nway in which they can still\nfind humour in a matter\nas serious as the band\u2019s\napparently imminent\nbreakup is quintessen-tially Beatles and sets the\ntone for the whole medley.\nThere is Spanglish on\n\u2018Sun King\u2019, pure silliness\non \u2018Mr. Mustard\u2019, and\n100% scouse filth on\n\u2018Polythene Pam\u2019 (about\nsexy time with a woman\ndressed only in polythene - YIKES). On \u2018She\nCame in Through The\nBathroom Window\u2019 they\nrecount the story of crazy\nfans breaking into Paul\u2019s\nhouse, and that brings us\nto \u2018Golden Slumbers\u2019.\nThere, further hope is\noffered when McCartney roars that \u201cGolden\nlooking pretty much only\nat the second half of the\nalbum. Did I get carried\naway? Affirmative. Could\nI write three times as\nmuch about the first half?\nIndeed-y-o! The point\nis that no one needs an\nintroduction to \u2018Here\nComes the Sun\u2019, \u2018Come\nTogether\u2019 or \u2018She\u2019s So\nHeavy\u2019. They are staples\nof their repertoire that\nevery music fan should at\nleast slightly know. Even\nthe ridiculous \u2018Octopus\u2019s\nGarden\u2019 - the best thing\nthat Ringo ever touched\n- and, depending on who\nyou believe, a tune either\nabout smoking weed out\nof a hookah pipe or an\noctopus salad that Mr.\nStarr had while on a break\nfrom the band, is instantly\nrecognisable. But the\nreal gems lie at the end.\nThey show what the band\nis really about. And the\nmessage that the album\nends on, \u201cAnd in the end\n// The love you take //\nIs equal to the love you\nmake\u201d, gives me goosebumps every time. The\nfinal message, that is, if\nyou discount the fact that\nthe album actually ends\non a tune about how they\nwant to bang the queen.\nThat\u2019s the Beatles for ya!\nHer majesty\u2019s a pretty nice girl! // Wikimedia\nWorld domination by synchronous walking? // The Beatles\nslumbers fill your eyes //\nSmiles awake you when\nyou rise // Sleep pretty\ndarling, do not cry // And\nI will sing a lullaby,\u201d\ncontinuing seamlessly\ninto \u2018Carry That Weight\u2019\nwhere the middle verse\nborrows the melody from\n\u2018YNGMYM\u2019, carrying on\nthe echo which makes the\nmedley feel so unified.\nYou may have noticed\nthat I\u2019ve spent a full page\n\n"

The\nother members\ninclude very senior\nm a n a g e m e n t ,\nexternal members\nwhoactasconsultants\nand watchdogs, each\nFaculty Dean, and\none elected member\nof teaching staff.\nAbhijay could not\nshare a lot of what\nis discussed at the\nCouncil, as much of\nwhat is discussed is\nstrictly confidential.\nAlthough some are\nnot \u2013 for example,\ndiscussions about\nthe sale of St. Mary\u2019s\nhave been going on\nsince before he joined\nCouncil and are still\ngoing. This raised a\nquestion.\nFelix: If the information is confidential,\nand you can\u2019t share\nit, even with other\nsenior members of\nthe Union, how are\nyou meant to act\nupon any of it in the\nstudent interest?\nAPS: To speak on behalf\nof one of my predecessors,\nthey could not use information learned in Council\nto help with a campaign\nthey were running \u2013 even\nthough that information\nmight have been useful.\nUsually it\u2019s not even so\nmuch that I couldn\u2019t share\nsomething, but that if I\ndid, I\u2019d likely be kept out\nof the loop in some future\ndecision and then no\nstudent would have any\nsay.\nFelix: So your hands\nare tied? Does that\nmean that to really\nchange anything,\nthe Union should be\ntaking a more oppositional approach?\nAPS: It could mean that.\nYou\u2019re not the first person\nto point out that the close\nrelationship this Union has\nwith this university can\nbe used against us \u2013 that\nindividuals might say \u201cwe\nhave so much influence at\nthe moment, why would\nwe do anything to risk\nthat?\u201d And if that means\nthey have to accept some\npoor decision \u2018X\u2019 or lack\nof consultation, then that\u2019s\nwhat happens.\nFrom my perspective,\nthe first thing we\u2019d need\nto do is start thinking\nabout leverage. I think a\nlot of my predecessors\nhave gone in and tried\nto change the minds of\nothers around them with\ncompelling arguments\nand evidence alone. It\u2019s a\ntrap that a lot of Imperial\nstudents fall into. They\u2019d\nthink that if we just had the\nright facts, we\u2019d be able\nto change people\u2019s minds,\nbut if someone else has all\nthe power and is dead set\non doing something you\ndisagree with, no amount\nof rational argument is\nnecessarily going to shift\nthings. You have to think\nabout leverage, power re-lations, changing people\u2019s\nincentives.\nFelix: What sort of\nleverage are you\ntalking about?\nAPS: One place to start is\nwith student satisfaction.\nFelix: But the scores\nhave been low for\nso long. Isn\u2019t that\nmostly something\ndepartments ad-dress, rather than the\nCollege as a whole?\nAPS: I don\u2019t think so.\nI think maybe in the\nbeginning people saw\nthe satisfaction scores\nas particular problems\nto be resolved within\nparticular courses, but\nnow there\u2019s a growing\nawareness among senior\nmanagement that the\nissue is broader. Both the\nProvost and Vice-Provost\n(Education) are talking\nabout the \u201cholistic student\nexperience.\u201d If services\nare cut, bad academic\ndecisions are made,\nand buildings like St.\nMary\u2019s are sold without\nforewarning, students see\nthat as all being from the\nsame thing: \u2018Imperial\u2019.\nThe point that is starting\nto be made, the point we\nshould be making, is that\nyou cannot fix one issue\nwith satisfaction without\naddressing the others. It\ndoesn\u2019t make sense to\ninvest tens of millions in\none place while cutting\nhundreds of thousands\nfrom somewhere else.\nFelix: What else can\nyou do at the mo-ment? What needs to\nchange?\nAPS: In the short term, it\u2019s\nabout making my voice\nheard during discussions.\nI\u2019ve already been told\nI\u2019m a lot more outspoken\nin places like Council\nthan my predecessors,\nand that\u2019s not a bad place\nto start. More generally\nthough, I think we need to\nlook fundamentally at the\nway decisions are being\nmade at Imperial.\nI strongly believe that\npeople who are affected\nby decisions should be\ninvolved in the deci-sion-making process. I\ndon\u2019t want the students\non the other side of the\ntable, trying to influence\ndecision-making from\nthe outside, I want them\non the same side of the\ntable, being one of the\ngroups making the deci-sions. The same goes for\noft-overlooked academic\nor support staff. I want\nto go further than simply\n\u2018consultation,\u2019 \u2013 which\noften becomes a check-box exercise \u2013 and think\nabout \u2018consent,\u2019 having a\nsay over things.\nI think this would lead\nto less friction between\nstudents and staff, departmental and senior\nstaff, and so on. If we\nwere involved earlier on,\nresults would be better,\nand people will feel, even\nif the broad outlines of\ndecisions are the same,\nthat they\u2019ve been brought\nalong.\nFelix: This is all very\ngeneral stuff \u2013 have\nyou thought about\nspecifics?\nAPS: I have. The first\nthing I want to do is sit\ndown with experienced\nstaff in the union and look\nat places where we think\ndifferent representation\nmight be needed, which I\nintend to do immediately\nafterWelcome. I then want\nto shape a plan talking to\nas many reps as possible,\ndown to department\nlevel, both undergraduate\nand postgraduate, the\nUnion Council and its\nsubcommittees. I want to\ntalk with staff \u2013 the trade\nunions, heads of depart-ment, Deans, Vice Deans,\nsenior administration\nroles within faculties, all\nthe way to the College\nSecretary, Provost, and\nPresident. This should\nallow us to come up\nwith something a large\nnumber of people can get\nbehind, that\u2019s pragmatic,\nwhile also allowing us to\naddress the root causes\nof problems at Imperial,\nnot just papering over the\ncracks.\nAbhijay will work on major projects with the other full time reps this year // ICU\n\n"
