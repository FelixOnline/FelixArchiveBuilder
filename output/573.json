    "content": "Letters to the Editor Sir\nI feel prompted to write to you\niO bring to your attention several\nobservations I have made over\nthe past term. That publication\nof yours, arbitrarily called' FELIX \u2014 The Newspaper of\nImperial College Union', seems\nto have changed beyond all recognition.\nLet me start by quoting the\nConcise Oxford Dictionary, Fifth\nEdition, Page 812: \" NEWSPAPER \u2014 printed publication,\nusually daily or weekly, containing the news, advertisements and\nliterary matter.\"\nNow allow me to apply that to\nthe FELIX we see now. Yes, it is\na printed publication, usually\ndaily or weekly. Yes, it does\ncontain advertisements. Yes, I suppose you could say it contains\nliterary matter, it depends on\nyour literary standards I would\nthink. But the news? No, not any\nnews. Well, not that you would\nrecognise as such.\nMaybe your father is Richard In grams( of Private Eye), or\npossibly Paul Foot( the ' crusading' journalist of the Daily\nMirror), or maybe both, I don't know, and don't particularly care. But it is a bit much to\nconvert that\" Newspaper of\nImperial College Union\" into a cross between Private Eye and\nPaul Foot's column, and that's what it looks like at the moment.\nIf it wanted to be a magazine it\nwould be called a bloody maga-zine, not a Newspaper.\nLet's take a few random\nexamples:\n1. FELIX572 Page 3: 50% of the page (and the\nwhole front cover) devoted to the\nfact that Mr Mooney wasn't in\nthe Honours List. Page 5: 50% of\nthe page taken up by a report on\nthe Rag Conference, which I still\ndon't know whether took place\nhere.\n2. FELIX569 Pages4 and7:20% of the\nTOTAL space in the issue taken\nup with an interview with Mr Mooney which was a little random to say the least.\n3. FELIX568 Page 1: The whole front page\ncontaining a frivolous report\nabout a Folk Club concert. Was\nit well attended or not, did anyone work it out from the\nreport?\nNeed I go on? I think the\nabove examples are sufficient to\nillustrate the confusion your\nsarcastic type of reporting creates\namong those very people you are\nmeant to be informing, namely\nthose who did not attend or\nwitness the event in question.\nBy all means have a sarcastic\nlook at something each week, bu i for God's sake keep it tucked\naway inside somewhere, in a column of its own (e.g. Keith\nWaterhouse in the Daily Mirror\non Mondays and Thursdays), so\nthat we all know that it's tongue\nin cheek, and not to be taken\nseriously.\nBy all means campaign for\nthings, but again give this a column of its own, and don't go\non so, you do get tiresome (see\nyour FELIX Editorial 567). And please try and keep your own\nviews where they belong, in your\ncolumn, the Editorial, not all\nover the letters page, the front\npae e and the rest. You don't do\nyourself justice having to have\nthe last word in every argument\neither. If people slate you in your\nown pages, read, note, think and\nswallow. If you don't get on with\nsomeone over a particular issue\n(e. g.Mr Mooney, Dare Afolabi)\nthen don't turn the affair into a rival to Dallas, it doesn'tim pov e your paper at all.\nReport the news straight, publish club reports when you\nhave them (that is the College\nnews too), have a giggle in one\ncolumn, a campaign in another\nand a bitch in your own and I think you'll imp ove your paper.\nSorry I 've gone on so, but tin\nabove needed to be said, I 've\nspoken to several people who\nagree with one or more of my\nobservations, and who still don't know if Bob Pegg was a sellout, so\nI think a lot of people in College\nare thinking what I 've just said. I wouldn't have said it if I didn't. Pete Kirkham Biochem 3\nSir\nOne section of the Rag Con ference report in last week's FELIX thoroughly shocked and\nappalled me. How a person can\nmake such an untimely and disgustingly bad taste joke over\nthe recent demise of our late\nbeloved Rag Chairman repulses\nme.\nHis motorcycling encounter\nwith the sheep shocked and saddened us all. But not it seems\nyou. Despite his awful deformities\nof mind and body, he always\ntried to serve us all to the best of\nhis restricted ability.\nMelancholily Yours\nGS Motley\nEE2 Dear Mr Marshall\nWe refer to the letter in FELIX571 concerning the\nMaths Department, in particular\nthe PS regarding the pre requisite of a PhD for an academic career.\nWe feel an unbalanced view of\nthe requirements necessary to\ncontinue higher education has\nbeen given.

    "content": "ISLAM\n1. Anchor of Belief\nKnowing God is the lever upon\nwhich the whole of ISLAM is\npivoted, without it every action in\nIslam or for it loses its real value, as\nit becomes an action without its aim,\nand what use is such an action?\nBut, how do we get to know God,\nand what is the way to this know-ledge? The answer to this question is\nvital and necessary, for failing to find\nthe way will block the aim we seek.\nMany people, past and present,\nhave denied God's existence because\nthey could not feel him with their\nsenses; thinking that such was the way to God. They called the believers as\nunscientific, unimaginative, misled\nperturbed, as well as many others in\na long list of names of mockery,\nbecause they believed in a way other\nthan the senses.\n2. Gravity and Neutrons\nThe physical reality of such people\nclearly shows the falsehood of their\naccusations. They believe in gravity\nand its laws even though they did\nnot see it; but only saw its effects.\nThey believe in the mind and they\nhave not seen it either, the same\ngoes for magnetism, the electrons,\nneutrons, etc. Thus they actually\nbelieve in many things their senses\ncould not detect; but the effects and\nconsequences lead them to these\nbeliefs, without any doubts.\n3. The Mind, The Senses and\nDeception\nthus it was the mind and not the\nsenses that lead them to these\nbeliefs, even though they have used\ntheir senses as a tool to collect data\nand information. But without the\nmind, there would have been no\nconclusion and hence belief. In\nactual fact, our senses may deceive\nus in many ways, and the truth is\ndisentangled using the mind alone.\nFor example: a stick half immersed\nin water looks as though it is broken;\nwhite numbers appear larger than\nblack numbers of the same size, we\nalways feel our heads at the upper\nposition whilst walking although we\nmay be at the south pole or the\nnorth pole. Thus it is clear that the\nmind is the key to correct perception\nand without it, our senses can\ndeceive us, and our knowledge\nwould have been non-existant. (?)-4. Straight and CrookedThinking\nGoing back to the original question;\nwere these people right in confining\nknowledge to the senses? Were they\nrational and objective when they\nrefused belief in God because they\ncould not detect him with their\nsenses; even though they have\naccepted many other facts they\ncould not sense, facts which constitute some of the major\ndiscoveries man has ever made.\nThus, this is one of the major\npaths of crooked thinking through\nout the ages, which served to\nalienate many people from the\ncorrect belief, even though it is\nobviously wrong. And even in this\nday and age we have heard about\nmany who do not believe just\nbecause they cannot see God, even\nnations have made such declarations,\nI cite the example of the Soviet\nUnion after sending the first satellite\ninto space.\nThe existence of this fallacy is as\nold as atheism is. It is a symptom of\nthe illness of the soul and the heart,\nand not a consequence of clear\nthinking or a just attitude.\n5. The Quran\nIn many instances in the Quran, it is\nexplained how many have insisted\non sensing God through their sight\nor hearing showing the illnesses\nleading to such claims. The Quran\nspecifies the reasons as: ignorance,\narrogance, perversion and injustice.\nRegarding ignorance: \" Those without knowledge say 'Why doesn't God speak to us? Or why a sign\ndoes not come?' So, the people\nbefore them have said\" \u2014 We notice\nhow the verse referred to the words\nof the ignorant rather than the\nknowledgeable and shows that the\nroad to God lies in his effects.\nRegarding arrogance: \"Such as\nfear not the meeting with Us (for\njudgement) say, 'Why are not the\nangels sent down to us or why do we\nnot see our Lord?' Indeed they have\nan arrogant conceit of themselves,\nand might ly is the insolence of their\nimpiety\". The day they see the\nangels, no joy will there be to the\nsinners that day. Thus here they\nwant to see, but who do they want to\nsee? They imagine that the present\nlife is all there is to it, and nothing is\nbeyond it. The verses have shown\nthat there will be a world different\nfrom this one where they can\nperceive, but in this life they cannot,\nand God is surely more difficult to\nperceive than the angels!\nConcerning perversion: \" The Pharoh said, ' 0 Haamaan, build me\nal of y palace that I may attain the\nways and means \u2014 the ways and\nmeans of reaching the heavens, and\nthat I may mount up to the God of\nMoses, but as far as I am concerned,\nI think Moses is a liar! This was\nmade alluring in Pharoh's eye i.e. the\nevil of his deeds, and he was\nhindered from the path.\"\nThus the Pharaoh followed the\nwrong path and was perverted.\nThe last of the reasons is injustice:\n\"they said \u2014 i.e. the Jews \u2014 'Show\nus God in public', but they were\ndazed for their presumption\" (or\ninjustice).\nThus they have accused the\nbelievers of imagination, lying, and\nemotionalism and today we see a continuation of this trend.\nThe Way to God, Its Signs\nTherefore, the way mentioned\nearlier will lead us astray in the\nsubject of finding about the nature of\nGod. The way to God lies in\nanalysing his effects, and therefore\nleads to him; and it is the only way \u2014\nthe mind, thought and knowledge\nbeing essential preconditions.\nThus without the mind the signs\ncannot be analysed; and without\nthought its creator cannot be found,\nand without knowledge neither\ncannot be done. This may seem\nstrange to such people as atheists,\nfor they always call themselves\nsecular, thoughtful, free, etc. But, a statement without proof has no\nvalue.\nIn Chapter \u2014 Al Shoora \u2014 God\nsays:\" But those who dispute concerning God after he has been\naccepted \u2014 futile is their dispute in\nthe sight of their Lord\". Verse 16\nThus, for the time being, we will\nstart the Quran. Whoever bothers\nto glance through it will notice how\nclearly the Quran sets the arguments\nfor the mind, the thought, and the\neffects of Allah. In chapter \u2014 Al Ah\nka f \u2014 God says: \" Say: 'Do you see\nwhat it is you invoke besides God?\nShow me what it is they have\ncreated on earth, or have they a share in the heavens? Bring me a book \u2014 revealed \u2014 before this, or\nany remnant of knowledge you may\nhave if you are telling the truth!'\".\nVerse 4\nThat is, is there an atom of\nknowledge verifying anyone else\nthan God as the creator. Thus if\npeople denied their Lord, it does not\nform a proof of knowledge but\ndemonstrates ignorance. In Chapter\n\u2014 Al Hajj \u2014 God says, \"Yet there is\namong men such a one that disputes\nabout God, without knowledge,\nwithout guidance, and without a book of enlightenment\". Verse 8\nUnlike complete ignorance, void\nof any knowledge, this is a special\ntype which God mentioned in\nChapter \u2014 Al Room \u2014 by saying,\n\"They know but the outer things in\nthe life of this world; but of the End\nof things they are heedless\". Verse\n7, and also says, \"Therefore shun\nthose who turn away from our\nmessage and desire nothing but the\nlife of this world. That is as far as\nknowledge will reach them\". Chapter Najm Verse 29/30\nIt is purposely stressed to mention\nknowledge, thought and the mind in\nthe Quran very frequently: \"there\nare signs for those who understand\"\nChapter Ra'ad Verse 4. \"Verily is\nthis a sign for people of knowledge\"\nChapter An Naml, Verse 52. \"Verily\nin this is a sign for those who give\nthought\", Chapter Nahl, Verse 11.\n\"In that are signs for those who\nhearken\", Chapter \u2014 Ar Room \u2014\nVerse 22. \"Say: 'Behold all that is in\nthe heavens and on earth'\", Chapter\nYoonus, Verse 101.\nThus whoever enquires through\nthe Quran realises that Islam assigns\nthe Muslim the duty of thinking, and\nlearning; and that knowledge and\nthought are part of the Muslim's personality. This is contrasted ot the\nnon-Muslim as a desire to amuse\nhimself with, or as a profession to\nearn a living, or as a hobby to some\nindividuals. Thus the reason for\nshouldering the Muslims with\nknowledge is that it leads them to\nIslam as the truth, \"And those to\nwhom knowledge has come see that\nthe revelation sent down to you\nfrom your Lord \u2014 that is the truth\",\nChapter Sabaa, Verse 6.\nThus we shall see that it was not\nthe lack of signs or the vagueness in\ntheir presentation that lead many to\natheism. In fact the signs are\ncountless, and with such clarity that\nthey become impossible to conceal.\nThe secret lies within the human\nbeing himself. The secret is how he\nmanages to avoid the signs, how he\nbecomes too arrogant to accept the\ntruth, in avoiding the truth, in\nperverting from the human norms\nand manners and ending as a closed\nshell unable to perceive even when\nconfronted by miracles.\nThe Quran informs us about such\npeople saying, \"Even if we opened\nout to them a gate from heaven, and\nthey were to continue all day\nascending therein; they would only\nsay: 'Our eyes have been in toxic a ted, nay we have been bewitched by\nsorcery\", Chapter Hijr, Verse 14/15.\n\"But if they see a sign, they turn\naway and say: \"This is but transient\nmagic\", Chapter Qamar, Verse 2.\n\"And how many signs in the heavens\nand the earth do they pass by? Yet\nthey turn away from them!\", Chapter\nYusut, Verse 105.\nSubmitted by IC Islamic Society for the enlightenment of FELIX\nreaders.\nImperial College\n: MSC1 W2v^ t f kroner\nLOrStrVtkctory 7- T5 -p. m.cfC T until 3 Warn.\nhsr till lt-OOpr*.\n(Jjonixm University Wemhtr)\n\n"

    "content": "OF GREAT NOTE to particle physics wall ahs is\nthe current highly ionised state of atmosphere\nprevalent in the upper storeys of the Union East\nStaircase. For the general joie-de-viv re always\nassociated with that quarter has been amplified\ninto a veritable electrical fizz with the news that\nthe Dramatic Society (your own, your v own) is to\nbe host to the finals of the Home Counties\nAmateur Dramatic Competition ( HAM DRAM1981). The Dram soc Storeroom has been\nimpassable with agog stagehands and wide-eyed\nwardrobe mistresses ever since the news broke\nall over the place.\nIt is a pity that Dramsoc itself will not be\nproducing a contribution to the festival, but the\ndisappointment of not reaching these finals is\n.more than out weighted by the eager anticipation\nof a feast and variety of the very cream of the\ncountry's amateur theatre. Some small insight of\nthe wide scope of this event might be gleamed\nfrom a retrospective look at some of the past\nwinners.\n1980 saw a triumph for the excellent if\ncontroversial feminist theatre group, TITS\n(Totally Intergrated Theatre of Socialism), with\ntheir viciously satirical, though often warmly\ncharming, musical depiction of East End life, \" A Bun In The Oven, But Sod All Sausages For\nTea\". Whereas, in stark contrast, 1979's winner\nwas \"The Shakespeare Story\", a drama tis ed documentary of the life of the Swan of Avon, from\nthe humble beginnings in Stratford, through all\nthe tribulations of the middle years, to the\ntriumphs at the Globe Theatre with the great\ntragedies.\nThe roll of honour has been filled with thrillers,\nexperimental minimalist mime, classics; in fact, all\nbranches of the art have been represented.\nDramsoc are fortunate to have secured a limited\nallocation of tickets which will become available in\nthe next two weeks.\nThe festival will run over four nights on 11-14\nMarch.\nGliding Club\nOVER THE CHRISTMAS vacation the Gliding\nClub again mounted an expedition to the\nNorthern wastes. The Club's Astir and Libelle,\nboth high performance sailplanes, were taken to\nthe Scottish Gliding Union's site at Portmoak,\nabout thirty miles north of Edinburgh. This site is\nrenowned for its 'waves' \u2014 huge stationary waves\nof air caused by up wind mountains. By flying the\nregions where the air is rising gliders can be\ncarried to great heights, often climbing at rates of\n800 feet per minute.\nThe four pilots who ventured north over the\nChristmas week were greeted with the sight of a very wet airfield which looked like it had just been\nbombed by the Luftwaffe. However, reasonable\nweather prevailed \u2014 only two days were not\nfly able and Club Captain Rob Green reached\n8000 feet on one of the two wave days.\nOver the New Year a new batch of pilots took\nover and were joined by staff members Mr Paul\nMinton of Civ Eng and Club President Mr Frank\nIrving. Only two days were fly able but both\nproduced exceptional conditions. Two Gold Heights (height gains over 3000m) were obtained\nby Martin Judkins and Alan Reeves, who reached\n14000 feet and 13400 feet respectively. The\nremaining time was spent in an alcoholic daze\nwatching the club house being demolished\naround us by gales and trying to relieve the\nboredom by abortive attempts at scaling the local\npeaks and a daring excursion to the tenpin\nbowling alley in Glenrothese, possibly the third\nmost exciting event on the whole expedition.\nMJ\nSF Sock\nONLY THREE YEARS LEFT to 1984 and already\nit's raining. The outlook is as black as Mark\nJeffcock's lapels, but are we down-hearted? Are\nwe depressed? Are we despondent? Are we\ndismal, desolate, dismayed, disp airing or even\ndandruff ridden? The answer is yes, and\ndesperate too. Next week on Sesame Street, the\nletter E and how to evade it.\nWell, what's new in the SF world? The answer\nis \u2014 nothing.

    "content": "CAREERS81 Some Do's and Dorits by Dr. Neil Harris,\nCollege Careers Officer\nDuring the coining months many gloomy forecasts will appear in\nthe press about graduate employment prospects this year. They\n, will mostly be written in very general terms and you may find it\ndifficult to fathom just what the implications are for you as a prospective graduate of Imperial College.\nEmployers, generally, have a very high regard for Imperial College\ngraduates. Some senior managers were graduates of this college themselves\nand naturally look to the College when they wish to recruit staff. Others\nhave recruited graduates from here in the past and found these people to be\ngood employees. This means that you start from a position in which the\naverage employer, although he has fewer vacancies than last year, is keen\nto consider your application. From there on it is up to you to compete well\nin what is a more competitive situation than in previous years. Here are\nsome simple DO'S and DON'T S to help you make a useful start. m DO make a start in seeking DO gain some idea of the kind of\nemployment or a further course of work you would enjoy and would find\nstudy NOW, unless the demands of\nyour studies arc too acute to allow\nyou to divert some of you energies\ninto this activity. Unlessamajorchange\noccurs in our national outlook there\nwill be few graduate job vacancies\nunfilled by July. If the recession does\nbegin to lift, more job vacancies will\nbecome available as the year pro-gres ses, but you cannot rely on this\nhappening. DON'T leave job seeking\nuntil after finals.\nDO remember that the employers\nvisiting College represent some, but\nby no means all, areas of graduate\nemployment. These are the large\nindustrial firms, engineering consultants and contractors, banks,\naccountants and the scientific civil\nservice. You will need to apply direct\nfor work in other areas of the civil\nservice, hospitals, water-boards, local\nauthorities, schools and small firms,\nmerchant banks, stock brokers,\npatent agents, etc. DON'T necessarily\nrely on the Graduate Recruitment\nProgrammes in College.\nsatisfying before you apply. A chat\nwith a Careers adviser, tutor or\nsomeone who already has a career in\n. the area you are considering should\nprove useful.\nDON'T make nebulous applications without any idea of the work in\nwhich you wish to start your career.\nDO find out something about the\nemployer. If the employer produces\nGraduate Recruitment Literature he\nwill expect you to have read it.\nDON'T make applications before\nyou have found out all you can about\nthe employer, and his vacancy\nsituation.\nDO take care in making your\napplication. Make sure that nothing\nis omitted which could be of some\nsignificance. Remember that you\nmust convince the employer that you\nwould have something to offer in the\njob concerned and would adapt to\nthe life style within his organization.\nDON'T assume that employers are\nonly interested in your academic\nqualifications. Give some indication\nof your interests and talents outside\nyour degree subject.\nDO take the trouble to look at the\nlatest lists of employers' requirements.\nMake sure that the job for which you\nare applying is one which is on offer.\nDON'T waste time applying for\nnon-existent jobs.\nDO realise that the first interview\nwill probably not include technical\nquestions and the interviewer may\nnot be a scientist or engineer. His\nbrief is to assess whether or not you\ncould roughly meet his firm's requirements and have the motivation and ability to eventually reach\nmore senior positions. DON'T fall\ninto the mistake of assuming that a non-technical interviewer is necessarily an unintelligent one. It has to be a success if you are to proceed to the\nfinal interview stage which could be\nhighly technical in its nature.\nFor many of you the whole process\nof applying for a job will be a new\nexperience. It includes a variety of\nskills and techniques which you will\nlearn as you progress. DO assess each\nexperience as it comes and try to\nlearn by your mistakes. There is a useful information sheet 'Applications\nand Interviews1\navailable from the\nCareers Advisory Service.\nFortunately, demand for engineers\nand scientists remains much greater\nthan for graduates in other dis-c ip lines. There continues to be a large\nrequirement for graduates in the\nelectronics industry and the oil\nindustry. Exploration lor minerals\nand oil throughout the world is\nparticularly active this year. The civil\nengineering industry in Britain is at a low ebb, but the large concerns are\nfinding contracts elsewhere and the\nnew nuclear power programme will\neventually provide challenging\ngrowth.\nVacancies in accounting, in sur ance, banking and retailing show\nlittle sign of reduction, but areas of\nthe manufacturing industry such as\nthe automobile manufacturers, the\nchemical industry and much of the\nheavy mechanical engineering in ud s try arc badly affected by the\nrecession.\nThere remains an acute shortage of\nteachers in secondary schools to teach\nsciences.\nThese ups and downs in demand\nmake it particularly important that\nv our approach should be flexible. If\nthe work you most wished to be\ninvolved in proves to be unattainable\nit will be nc cesar y to consider other\noptions. For those who take care to\nmake well thought out approaches to\n\"m ploy ers at the right time, 1981\nneed not be such a bad year as the\npress would have us believe.\nThe facilities of the Careers\nAdvisory Service are available to\nassist you with your career choice and\nany difficulties you may encounter\nduring the search for suitable\nemployment. We wish all final year\nstudents both postgraduate and\nundergraduate every success in these\nendeavours.\nFor further careers advice, contact\nthe Careers Office (level 3 Sherfield)\nor your departmental careers\nadvisor.\nCITY and GUILDS UNION proudly presents\nthe 30th Annual Engineers'\nDINNER AND DANCE\nRoyal Garden Hotel\n\u00a325 per DOUBLE ticket\nAvailable NOW in Guilds Office.\nDINNER SUITS\nPrice of ticket includes a bottle of\nwine and unlimited cork age.

    "content": "Mooney Monopoly Challenged?\nAT THE Holland Club AGM on\nWednesday, Holland Club members decided unanimously\nto \" discuss with the College authorities the feasibility of\ntransferring responsibility for the\nHolland Club bar and refectory\nto the Holland Club management\ncommittee\". This in effect would\nbe reverting to the situation which existed prior to the movement of the Holland Club to its present location in October\n1976, when the Holland Club was responsible for its own affairs. If the Holland Club is\nsuccessful in its negotiations, the\nRefectory Committee's control of\nall catering and bars in College\n(the Mooney Monopoly) will be\nbroken.\nHolland Club members have\nnever been content with the\nprices or the standards of the\nCollege-run catering. They feel\nthat despite numerous protests,\nthere has been little or no attempt by the College to\nimprove the service offered. Also,\nhaving managed their own affairs\nin the past, independent of the\nMooney Monopoly, they are\nconfident that they could offer a cheaper, better service them selves.\nBarry Holt, the Chairman of\nthe Holland Club Management\nCommittee, recently raised the\nquestion of independence of the\nHolland Club facilities with John\nSmith, College Secretary( incidentally, a member of the\nHolland Club). Mr Smith indicated that if the general membership expressed strong feeling on\nthe matter, then the College would consider any proposals the\nManagement Committee made.\nThe Holland Club has a membership of around a thousand\nnon-academic staff, of which just\nover 100 members attended the\nAGM on Wednesday. Their policy decision will be discussed\nat the next Holland Club Management Committee meeting on\nMonday. Prior to their move to the new\nfacilities adjacent to the Huxley\nBuilding four years ago, the\nHolland Club had been \"home-less\" for about five years. In their\nold quarters they had run their\nown catering, mostly by voluntary labour of workers.\nHolland Club officials are\nreluctant to speculate on the\nnature of any alternative catering\narrangements they may be\nconsidering, as negotiations with\nthe College into the exact form of\nindependence from the Mooney\nMonopoly arc only beginning.\nHowever, if the College does\nagree to let the Holland Club run\ntheir own affairs agin, the possibility exists of outside catering being contracted in to\nthe Holland Club. This would at\nlong last provide some comparative figures on the efficiency,\npricing and standards of Mooney\nfood and drink.\nSex\nScandal\nA RETIRED Ambassador, Sir\nPeter Hay man, KCMG, CVO, MBE, has been \"revealed\" in\nPrivate Eye as a Paedophile, and a possessor of pornographic photos,\narticles of female clothing indicating the regular entertainment of prostitutes, and 46\nquarto diaries of80 pages cataloging six years of deviant\nsexual activity. He has been\ncautioned by the police not to\nsend obscene material through\nthe post as he has done. (See\nbelow.)\nThe Eye suggested that charges\nhad been dropped, and the\nmatter hushed up as an establishment \" fix\". What makes this all relevant to\nIC is that he is a Governor of the\nInternational Student House where a number of IC students\nreside.\nHay man was questioned by\nObscene Publications Squad Officers after pornographic literature was left on a bus.\nSRC Grants Threatened\nUniversity science departments may have their 'quota' places for PhD student awards reduced or abolished if they fail to achieve an\nacceptable standard of PhD completion rates, Sir Geoffrey Allen,\nChairman of the Science Research Council said on Tuesday.\nA recent study by the Council showed that about 60% of Council funded students completed their PhDs within four years, but Sir\nGeoffrey would prefer this figure to be 90%. He suggested that new\nawards would be made to departments only if its previous students had\nfinished their work quickly enough.\nThe S RC has drawn up a list of institutions ranged in order to PhD completion rates of S RC funded students. Birmingham comes top of\nthe list, but Imperial College is surprisingly thirty-first out of thirty-five, being following only by Exeter, the Polytechnics, Sussex and\nBradford.\nA working party of the Government's Advisory Board for the\nResearch Council describes the discrepancy between institutions as\nstartling and says there is no obvious explanation. It has to be assumed\nthat it represents a difference in the ethos of institutions, it says.\n\" If this is so then to reform what is wrong one needs to twist the arms\nof the institutions rather than those of the students,\" it adds.\nMeanwhile, the Board of Studies has noted that a \"significant\nproportion of research students had not submitted for their\ndegree/diploma some four years after commencing their research.\"\nThis may be due to the difficulty or obscurity of the subject matter in\nIC PhD subjects.\nA questionnaire has been circulated to registered PhD students\nregarding the length of time it is taking for completion of their work.\nStudents who have completed their research and are currently engaged\nin \" writing up\" have not been circulated as their names are not on the\nalphabetical list of students. It is important that these students should\ncontact John Passmore at the ICU Office to be included in the survey.\nStop Press\nYESTERDAY, Shirley Williams\nspoke at Imperial College. The\nsubject of her talk was the Report of\nthe Independent Commission on\nInternational Development Issues\nunder the Chairmanship of Willy\nBrandt. The report is available at the\nIC Bookshop priced \u00a31.95.\nMs Williams told FELIX that she\nhoped that we have a group at IC,\nwho are interested in the Brandt\nReport. \" A real effort is needed.\nImperial is a singularly appropriate\nplace to do something. Wc need a new concept of engineering. Wc\ncannot simply pick up technology\nand apply it to the Third World\nwithout doing immense harm,\" she\nsaid.\nYesterday's talk by Shirley Williams was the first of series of four\nDepartment of Humanities events\ndiscussing the Brandt Report. Ms\nWilliams gave the viewpoint of the\nNorth. Next Thursday the High\nCommissioner for Tanzania will\ndiscuss the South's views of the\nReport.\nPipe Dream\nTHE PHOTOGRAPHIC Society's Black and White competition was\nheld last Tuesday. Over two dozen prints were scrutinised by a professional judge. It was an open competition and the subjects included\ncandid portraits, landscapes, photojournalism and still life.\nThe photos were displayed and each print was discussed by the judge.\nHis advice varied from hints on how to improve picture composition,\nmaking the most of available lighting and how to select the area of the\nphoto to be used for the final print. The judge highly commended\nseveral prints and commented that members of the society had obviously\nput in a lot of effort.\nTension mounted as the judge whittled the entries down to the final\nfour. Who would win the \u00a35 first prize, the second prize of a roll of slide\nfilm and the third \u00a32? The judge awarded the first prize to FELIX photographer, Colin Palmer DoC III, whose winning entry was a still\nlife, 'Apple pipe.'\nThe judge explained that he chose the winning print because of its\nimpact. He commented that it was a technically difficult print because\nagitated masking methods were used in the final printing. The winner of\nthe second prize entered a portrait of a child sucking its thumb and the\nsame photographer came 3rd with a portrait of a couple in a classic pose.\n(If the runner up ( N Hashem) or other entrants would like their prints\nto be considered for publication in The Phoenix or possibly in next\nweek's FELIX then please drop your prints into the FELIX Office).\nS Colin Palmer\nThe winning photo (see above) was created as part of a portfolio\nwhich will be published in this year's ICU literary magazine, The\nPhoenix. The magazine will be on sale towards the end of this term.\nFELIX asked Colin Palmer to comment on his winning entry, \" I enjoy creating surrealistic images of everyday objects. My subjects are\nusually constructed out of fruit and kitchen b rica brac. I aim to choose,\nmaterials that have a symbolic aura as well as texture. The composite\nstructure cries out to be photographed.\"\nPage 4 FEUX, January 16,1981\n\n"

It went on by suggesting that Mr Mooney had \"stored up the best\nfood for outside visitors\" implying that only by underhand methods\nwas Mr Mooney capable of being congratulated as a superb caterer.\nThe article then quoted, totally out of context, a comment made last\nterm in FELIX by Mr Mooney suggesting he was expecting an award,\nbefore stating that students were\" emaciated, sick and undernourished\" and \"suffering\" from eating at IC. This statement is\nwidely regarded as true, if a little overstated. The report then put\nlor ward the idea that profits from the refectories should go to the funds\nof a major political party.\nFELIX then moved into Spanish, asking Mr Mooney if he \" had much food poisoning lately?\" and the staff \" why don't you try\nemploying a chef instead of a washer-up to do the cooking?\" to be\nanswered by \" Why don't you spit over somebody else?\" These are\nfabrications.\nThe report went on to present a partly false picture of Mr Mooney's catering ability, mainly that his career had started on the Mile End Road and that he had won an award for his catering. To the best of\navailable knowledge, both these suggestions arc false. Next, it was\nalleged that IC's catering has disintegrated into a disgusting state\nsince Mr Mooney came here, and that he was a buffoon. Whilst Mr Mooney is not a buffoon, the previous allegation cannot be so easily\ndismissed.\nThe article went on to say that College kitchens broke large parts of\na Public Health Act, before setting off on a vicious condemnation of the\nway outside customers are treated.\nThe reference to Buckingham Palace is utterly without substance. In\nthe last paragraph, it was suggested that Miss Snee had bribed\nCollege lor her exam passes and attributed to her a statement which\nshe did not make, and wishes to be disassociated from.\nHence the story only raised one valid point, that the catering service\ndoes turn out good food, when specially ordered, usually for people\noutside College, whilst it made defamatory allegations about prominent people.\nDue to FELIX not appearing until Friday afternoon, there was\nlimited reaction last week.\nThis Monday, however, disdain started to pour in to the IC Union Office, as a reply to the torrent of criticism Mr Marshall unleashed.\nTowards the end of the afternoon, Mr Passmore visited the FELIX Office to speak to Mr Marshall. He said that both the Rector, Lord Flowers, and the Chairman of the Refectory Committee, Dr Schroter,\nhad objected to the previous week's issue. Mr Passmore also said that he\nwould bring the matter up at the evening's ICU Publications Board\nMeeting. Continued on page three.\nNo.573 Friday, January 16,1981 Free!\n\n"

    "content": "HEADLINE CAUSES CONTROVERSY Continued from front page.\nAt the meeting, the earlier part of the agenda was swiftly dealt with,\nso as to fully consider the FELIX situation.\nLiz Lindsey said that the Executive disapproved of FELIX being\nused as a slang ing organ. They thought it did not represent the views of\nthe whole Union. Others at the meeting suggested that the article had\ngone beyond a joke and asked for a reason for the article, to be told by\nMr Marshall that it was entertainment. When Mr Marshall was asked\nwhy he misquoted Rae Snee in that manner, he said that he thought\nthat the entire article was written in such a style that even a dimwit\nwould realise that she had not said that. When asked to justify the\npersonal attack on Mr Mooney, Mr Marshall said he did not wish to\ndo so then, but later in term through FELIX. Other matters raised included whether any feedback had been\nreceived from other students (none had); whether Pub Board was\nresponsible for FELIX; if the newspaper should represent the views of\nthe student body or Lord Flowers; and whether any change would occur\nin Mr Marshall's editorial style as a result of the complaints made,\nwhich was thought unlikely. The Board decided that (i) it does not\nagree with the vindictive nature of many articles in FELIX and asked\nMr Marshall to take the views of Pub Board into account in future, (ii)\nhe should apologise both publicly and privately to Mr Mooney, and\n(iii) he should not print any further personal attacks on Mr Mooney.\nThese decisions were passed 4-1, 5-0, 2-0, from eleven voting members\npresent. Jon Firth, Chairman, expressed the Board's dissatisfaction\nwith Mr Marshall's article.\nMr Firth told FELIX later that he did not expect Mr Marshall to\ntake any notice of the criticisms made, but he was glad the matter had\nbeen discussed to such an extent.\nOn Tuesday, John Passmore returned to the FELIX Office to tell\nMr Marshall that he had seen the Rector who said that FELIX last\nweek was disgusting, as it had been throughout the year. Mr Passmore\nasked Mr Marshall, once again, to apologise privately and on the front\npage of FELIX, otherwise he would initiate disciplinary action against\nhim at Union Council, or elsewhere. This might involve one or any\ncombination of:\na) A reprimand\nb) Temporary withdrawal of privilege\nc) Temporary/permanent suspension from some or all of Union facilities and amenities\nd)A fine not ex ceding the cost of replacing any damaged property\nor equipment\ne)A fine not exceeding \u00a310, to be donated to the Union charity of\nthe current year.\nThese punishments can only be imposed by the Executive and not\nby Council, however there is provision for an appeal to a Committee of\nfive persons and a non-voting chairman, all randomly chosen by\nCouncil.\nIf the Executive Committee wish to remove the FELIX Editor from\noffice, he would be deemed dismissed, and have all his resp on sib li ties and privileges accorded to him as Editor removed if, and only if, his\ndismissal is approved by a two-thirds majority at two General Meetings held not less than twenty-eight College days, but not more\nthan forty College days, apart.\nAssuming he was dismissed, the Honorary Secretary, Liz Lindsey, it\nseems likely, would take over as newspaper Editor, ensuring the\nproduction of the newspaper and the day to day running of the litho\nprinting facilities as well as her own job.\nThe next move in this matter may well be at the Union Council meeting on Monday, January19, but it seems unlikely that the opinion\nof the whole student body will be canvassed fully for some time.\nBookshop takeover\nTHE IMPERIAL COLLEGE Bookshop has a new manager,\nMr Roy Hicks, who took up his\nappointment last week. He told'\nFELIX that amongst his future\nplans were to invite publishers to\npresent exhibitions, approximately once a month, which would not just contain academic\nbooks. He intends to have books\non non-academic College act iv i ties, such as the series of forth-coming tk\u00bbks on the Brandt Commission's Report. He wishes\nto publicise the Bookshop more,\nby having more signs put up, by\na noticeboard in the Shop, and in\nFELIX by giving a list of popular\nbooks throughout the country,\nmore book reviews and notice of\nany special offers available to\ncustomers. He hopes to cooperate\nmore will local libraries and colleges, to ensure a better service\nfor students and full use of facilities.\nUGM Farce\nBarney McCabe a goat\nTHE FIRST UGM of the term was held In the unfamiliar\nsurroundings of Mech Eng 220, last Thursday lunch tl me. The meeting opened to less than 150 people with the Exec\ncomplaining about their hard seats. John Passmore, ICU\nPresident, took the chair In the absence of Jon Firth, who had\nsent his apologies.\nMr Passmore was jokingly objected to as Chairman on the grounds\nthat he was \"not qualified\". However, the meeting rapidly accepted\nthe minutes of the last meeting and heard the President's business, for\nwhich Rae Snee took the chair. Amid continuous heckling, Mr Passmore told the U GM about the Governing Body meeting and the\ndecision to continue with the Nuclear Fuel Technology course. He said\nthat the Rector had agreed to meet a small number of interested\nstudents to discuss the course, and people are asked to contact the\nPresident by today (January 16). On Residence, Mr Passmore said that\nfrom next year everyone who wishes will receive one year in Hall. Referring to WU S, he said it was ironic that most of its grant came\nfrom the Government. Liz Lindsey announced that the IN COST Conference was now definitely going on and nearly sixty delegates\nwere coming. Rae Snee, the DP, wh has just recovered from an ill nes, said that ' Mike', the IC mascot, was heavily guarded owing to\ntelephone calls enquiring about it, which led them to think it might be\n\"violated\" soon.\nShe continued by saying that the loose furniture had arrived for\nStan's and added that another beer promotion night would be held\nsoon \u2014 the John Bull having been successful. All three reports were\naccepted, Liz Lindsey, as returning officer, asked the meeting to ratify\nBarney McCabe as P WP ordinary member. The meeting said \" No\". The President asked \" Why not?\" and was told \"Because he's a goat\".\nAfter more muttering and joking at Mr McCabe' s expense, he was\ngrudgingly accepted.\nRich Archer announced the R CSU End of The World Party, to\nmark the beginning of Reagan's Presidency, on January20, and Dave\nGayer announced the Guilds Dinner and Dance (tickets from the\nGuilds Union Office) and mentioned that they would have cheap rates\nfor Dinner Suits and overnight accommodation at the Hotel.\nWhen the meeting moved on to consider motions, Mr Passmore said\nthat three of the four had been withdrawn. Matthew Hunt bach offered\nto propose the Student Loans motion. The motion on Bicycles was\ncalled, but no one at the meeting wished to propose it, the original\nsponsors not having turned up.\nHowever, the motion was token ly proposed, token ly objected to, \" I oppose this motion, I think I 've said enough,\" and the debate token ly summed up, \" If we're going to be silly, we may as well pass it,\" before\nthe motion was accepted on the vote.\nAs Matthew Hunt bach rose to speak on the Student Loans motion, a procedural motion was moved, that the question be not put, because\nthe Union did not presently know enough on the subject. This was\naccepted on the vote.\nThe meeting then discussed other business, Owen Greene asking\nthose present not to forget about the Nuclear Arms Campaign. During this, the STOIC film crew arrived at 1:25pm. The President said he\nexpected the motion on Multilateral Disarmament to be considered at\nthe next U GM. The meeting closed at 1:30pm with less than 200\npeople present throughout.\nMr Passmore told FELIX later that he thought the low turnout was\ndue mainly to exams at this time. He said he was annoyed at those who\nput forward motions and then withdrew them.\nPatrick Coll\nShack Shock\nIC HAM SOC members returned\nfor the term to find that their\ntransmitting shack, on the top of\nthe Union Building, had been\nremoved. The Estates department \" pulled it down to repair\nthe roof,\" and Rae Snee told last\nweek'sU GM that it might cost\nthe Union as much as \u00a31,500 to\nreplace.\nPhones\nhooked up\nLAST WEEK the phone system\nin the Southside HallsofResidence\nwere eventually connected to the\ninternal phone system. Subscribers may now dial from the\ninternal system to a Southside\nlanding, or in the other direction,\nby prefixing the required number\nwith a zero.

    "content": "Apology Iam pleased to point out that remarks attributed to Rae Snee in last week's issue,\nconcerning Mr Mooney, are completely false. I wish to apologise to Miss Snee for any\ninconvenience and difficulty caused to her by\n[as untruthful reference. Anyone knowing\nMiss Snee would have realised that such an\nutterance is totally uncharacteristic of\nsomeone of her maturity.\nMooney\nIt is interesting to note the Holland Club's decision to ask College if they can manage\ntheir own catering facilities instead of relying\non the services of the College Catering Service. Prior to this, Guilds Union decided to\nhold their Dinner & Dance outside College at\nthe Royal Garden Hotel. RCS Union have for\nmany years employed outside caterers for the\nSikvood Ball.\nI wonder, is some kind of message filtering\nthrough?\nI think not, College Catering Manager, Mr Mooney, is as thick-skinned as his baked\nmince-beef rolls. The College catering service\nseems oblivious to the views of the students.\nThe College catering service thrives only on its\nmonopoly; it does not have to compete for\nbusiness, for if it did it would have to improve\nor surely fold. Last year, refectory boycotts had\nlittle effect, except to make known the student\nfeeling. This year, John Passmore plans no\nrefectory boycotts and has even told me that\nhe considers the food to have dramatically improved since he has been here. Mr Passmore seems to prefer to clown about as\nan ineffectual organ of the Rector's opinion\nwithout regard for the students' views that he\nwas elected to represent to Lord Flowers and\nthe Governing Body.\nThe facts are clean The standard of College\ncatering is disgusting. Mr Mooney, as\nRefectory Manager, is responsible for\n\"providing the Refectory Service or maintaining it, subject to economic considerations,\nto the satisfaction of the College authorities\"( Direct Quote \u2014 emphasis mine). I suspect he\nperforms this task admirably. Now, it is about\ntime he started to satisfy the students of\n.Imperial College, without whom there would\n.be no \"College authorities\"..\nThe readers' views are invited, as are Mr. Mooney's, for publication in the letters page.\nThanks to\nPatrick, Caroline, Mark, Dave, Phil, Steve,\nScaramouche, Shanne, Colin, Paul, And y,D. G.,W. M., Ian, and Maz. Reviews\nThe Traveller in the Forest A film by RogerS totes bury Wednesday marked the opening of former\nICU Hon Sec, Roger Stotesbury's latest film.\nShot over a two year period it is an\nadventurous and interesting attempt at\nproducing a short length feature with limited\nresources and equipment. The result is\npleasantly surprising.\nThe film opens with a domestic scene in the\nhome of the central figure, a nameless man\nplayed by Suki Kalirai. His daily routine begins;\nfriction at home, a train journey, the crowds\npouring to work over London Bridge and the\noffice. But this day turns out to be different. He\nis dismissed and in his fear and confusion\nwanders the streets of London, gradually\nbecoming more aware of the aspects and\npotential of his life which were disguised by his\nboring existence.\nHis reaction is one of sorrow and bewilderment. In search of change, he travels\nout of the city, but still finds that the forest\n(symbolically) encloses him. Now, however, he\nis not shielded by the ignorance of his previous\nmediocrity and he runs in confusion, trying to\nfind a means of escape.\nAs the above description shows, the film is\nlaced with symbolism to which any number of\ndifferent meanings can be attached. The\n\"hero\" wears a blank white mask, which could\nbe indicative of his uniformity or that he is\nmasked from the truth of his existence. Either\nway it adds to the visual impact of the film,\nwhich is packed with many shots of the sterile\nand featureless city. If anything, there is a succession of cuts which are too rapid, giving a feeling of frustration at having so little time to\ndwell on the more interesting shots. The photography is generally good, especially\nconsidering that it was all shot with a small\nSuper-8 camera.\nThe soundtrack proves to be very unusual,\nmainly consisting of radio broadcasts and\nnoise, which build to a quite frightening climax\nat the end of the film.\nAs an amateur effort this is certainly a good\nattempt and is of particular interest as it was\nwritten and filmed by an IC student and includes scenes in and around College. There\nare four showings today at 5:30, 7:00, 8:30 and\n10:00pm in the Southside Penthouse Dining\nRoom (Tizard/Falmouth lifts). Tickets are on\nsale, price 75p from the Haldane Library or on\nthe door if available.\nRattle of a Simple Man\nONCE AGAIN the old firm of Pauline Collins\nand John Alderton are in action on the London\nstage. Pauline Collins prefers interpreting\nmodern playwrights, but the \"Rattle\" was\nwritten nearly thirty years ago, and it is a play\nboth have long wished to perform.\nRon is down for the weekend to watch his\nfavourite team play in London, it is also an\nexcuse for a night on the town. While he is\nsomewhat the worse for drink, his extrovert\nfriend \"Guige\" dares him to spend the night\nwith a whore they picked up at a nightclub.\nSo the scene is set, the gauche northerner,\nshy, naive, and lonely and the whore, provocative, offhand, attractive. Ron sudden l\" realises what he has done. Going to bed is out\nof the question, but the \u00a350 bet! So the scene\nis set for a touching, revealing insight into two\napparently very different people.\nAfter years of working together on TV and\non the stage these two fine actors complement\neach other perfectly The result is an entertaining night out, although lacking any\npunch or message, atypical WestEnd production. \"Rattle\" is playing at the Savoy\nTheatre in the Strand.\nLee Paddon\nWhat' s On\nFriday, January 16\n\u2022Socialist Society Bookstall, lunchtime, JCR.\nSunday, January 18\n\u2022Talk by Lord Flowers on issues of Nuclear Power,\n7:30pm, More House, 53 Cromwell Road.\nMonday, January 19\n\u2022Sailing Club Cheese, Wine and Disco, 7:30pm, SCR,\n\u00a31.20 (includes food and wine).\nTuesday, January 20\n\u2022MOPSOC Lecture: Clouds, Thunder and Lightening,\n1:00pm, Physics LT2.\n\u2022STOIC Transmission, 1:00pm, JCR and Halls.\n\u2022Riding Club Meeting, 1:00pm, Elec Eng 1110.\n\u2022Fishing Club Inaugural Meeting, 1:30pm, Chem Eng\nE450.\n\u2022IC Labour Club, Andy Bevan, Labour Party Youth\nOfficer on Youth For Socialism, 1:00pm, Maths341.

A great big\nhandsome thing it is, all made of oak with the\n\u2022scale pans and moving parts in solid brass.\nWhen I bought it, it had four brass weights\nand I found that by putting the right weights on\none or both sides of the scales, I could weigh\nany whole number of ounces from one to ten\n(and also a few amounts greater than ten).\nTypically, the day came when the one ounce\nweight slipped into the flour, was baked into a fruit cake, and came off second best against\ngranny's dentures. So now I manage without a one ounce weight. But this isn't much of a handicap, as I have found that although the\nthree remaining weights cannot be used to\nmeasure five ounces, I can still use them to\nweigh any other whole number of ounces from\none to ten inclusive.\nHow heavy are they?\nSolutions, comments and criticisms to me\nc/o FELIX Office.

Though not many\npeople turned up, due to lack of publicity, a good time was had by all.\nAs hoped the majority of games were\nunpredictable. The final of the Singles Tournament was a tense and exciting match\nbetween Chris Nicolaides and Chat Eimsin,\nbut finally Chris won the final game and won\n3-2.\nThe doubles also was a lively event, with\npartners chosen by the draw, table tennis\nabilities came second to partner compatibility. The final, arranged by the finalists\nthemselves to be out of three games, was\nmore to see which team was the steadier with\nthe team of Andy Tye and Olivatosin Osikoya\nbeating Chi rs Nicolai des and Kumar Singaragah 2-0.\nMany thanks to Andy Cowling for arranging\nthe tournaments.\nResults and Reports 10th January\nRugby\n1st XV VW HMS4222 nd XV V Wasps 0-22\nFootball\n1st XI V Kings 1-3\n2nd XI V Kings 2-1\n3rd XI V LH52 Hockey1 st XI V Harlow 2-1\n2nd XI V Harlow 0-5\n3rd XI V Harlow 1-0\nFootball Seconds\nIC Seconds gained a valuable victory on a day when the wind and assorted hail showers\ncombined with a low sun to make good football very difficult.\nPredictably enough the early part of the\ngame was slow. During this period, Niccolls,\nRick ard and Beer all saw their shots go\nnarrowly wide. It was then that Williams,\nplaying his first game for the seconds made\nan important save as he dived low to his left to\nturn a shot wide. Soon after this, IC went\nahead when Rickard flicked the ball across\nthe penalty area for Niccolls to shoot his half\nvolley just inside the post.\nAfter half-time, Kings were allowed far too\nmuch of the ball, though rarely encroached\non the IC penalty area. IC always looked\ndangerous on the break though it was certainly not Malcolm Carr's day. He slipped\none shot neatly past the keeper, only, for it to\nbe blown away from the goal by the wind, and\nhad another goal disallowed for offside. IC's second goal came when Saunders was put\nclear and blasted his shot inside the near\npost. In the closing minutes Kings scored a consolation goal through it was not enough\nto stop IC Second's successful league run.\nTEAM: Williams, Curran, Beer, Armstrong,\nGriffiths, Lakin, Wiggins, Niccolls, Carr,\nSaunders, Rickard.\nFootball Thirds\nIN ATROCIOUS CONDITIONS on Saturday\nthe Thirds made a good start to the term.\nHealy scored the first goal and a few minutes\nlater Dhillon made it 2-0\nEarly in the second half, Flanagan scored\nIC's third goal when a back-heel by Healy left\nhim with only the keeper to beat. Hatton was\nunlucky to have a co se range shot save on the\nline, but produced further evidence of his\nreturn to form by viciously kicking an\nopponent. IC were unlucky to have their lead\nreduced when the Hospital was awarded a controversial penalty, but soon recovered\nfrom this setback and Flanagan scored the\nfourth goal from close range. Gilbert in goal\nwas grateful for a few defensive errors to help\nhim keep warm. He made some excellent\nsaves, but was unable to prevent a rebound\nfrom an opponent giving the Hospital a second goal. IC sealed up the match when\nSims sent healy clar to slot in IC's fifth.\nTEAM: Gilbert, Dunhill, Redmayne, Hatton,\nBerns, Dhillon, Archer, Sims, Rimmer,\nFlanagan, Healy.\nHockey Thirds\nIN A MATCH played in appalling conditions\nIC thirds managed to beat Harlow by the odd\ngoal.\nThe conditions and temperature were not\nsuitable for hockey yet early in the match IC\nplayed good hockey culminating in a goal by\nChris Pound. Hughes was unlucky on several\noccasions not to score( better luck next\nSaturday evening Pete!) and only some diabolical efforts by Harlow prevented further\nIC goals.\nIC's solid defence of Rampton and Sawers\ncombined well with new goalkeeper Hopkins\nin what was otherwise a cold, dour second\nhalf \u2014 with the only highlight being the IC\nshort corner defence routine of having three\ngoalkeepers on the goal-line.\nTEAM: Hopkins, Rampton, Sawers, Webb,\nHughes, Clift, Mitchell (Capt), Mahers, Wylie,\nTaylor, Pound, Woollard.\nSwimming\nON WEDNESDAY, December 10, Imperial\nCollege met University College in an inter-college swimming gala. In a close run battle,\nIC managed to beat UC86 points to 77. The\nUC women's team were very strong, but IC\npulled the match back with their excellent\nrelay teams. The IC team was Susan Wilton,\nNicola Hammond, Jane Hiller, Neeran Al Sarraf, Katy Woolley, Nick Last, Jim Boucher,\nMike Casey, Rich Leach, John Heffernan,\nBarry Ashwin, Bob Bradley, Bill Fahey, and\nChris Garton.\nI would like to give a big thank you to Mr\nCasey who came all the way from Boreham\nWood to officiate, and also to Cliff Spooner\nthe pool manager.\nGuilds Sixes\nARE YOU man( or woman) enough to\ncompete in\nTHE GUILDS SIXES\nIf so, please submit teams (preferably same\ndept, same year, 1 guest, but I am flexible) (?\n- Ed) to Guilds Union Office.\nIf you don't have enough for a complete\nteam, just give a list of names, there's always\nenough for a few extra teams.\nPhil Niccolls\nMech Eng Rm 211\nFEUX, January 16,1981 Page 7\n\n"
