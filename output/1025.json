    "content": "News\nNews Review\ny pn ng BY ANDYS IN HA RAY It was in the midst of Beit Brawls, ex-miners\nearning millions, certain s a bbs having lockjaw\nand KCL finding themselves a tad lacking in the\nstone lion department that college closed for the\nholiday. But no sooner had Santa Claus left\nSouth Ken, IC launched into a literally fiery new\nyear...\nJanuary\nArson attacks, absent aero assessments and\nNUS affiliation were on the agenda...\nFELIX1 Q16 Linstead was still recovering following an arson attack before\nChristmas. \"The situation was tackled well,\" the warden said. (The\nnow notoriously overactive smoke alarm system was still not running).\nICU's new constitution got passed, despite various complications,\nnotably the much-amended 'Mary's Amendment' while the fact that\nICU itself could soon be in Sherfield met with mixed reactions. IC's ex-rector Sir Eric Ash became Acting Head of the maligned Student\nLoans Company, who say his experience is 'a valuable asset.'\nFELIX1 Q17 As the OSC squeezed the world into the J CR to publicise International\nWeek, Aero exam papers went AWOL, vanishing into the Christmas\npostal quagmire. 4th years relaxed as exams were postponed. If the\nsummer papers were to disappear, an Aero chief mused: \"I don't know\nwhat you'd do then, jump out of the window or something.\" An election fiasco loomed; premonitions of the results or turnout?\nActually, not enough swipe card readers would be available. Our social\nguardian, ICU Council, got its members writing to MPs highlighting\nstudent poverty; in contrast it was reported that nationally, IC receives\nthe most academic funding per student. But student fraud still remains\na problem. Sir Eric clearly has his work cut out.\nFELIX1 Q18 Another brawl, another venue: Queen's Lawn. In the wake of a catalogue of violent incidents, caution was called for when organising\ndrink-related events. The first candidate in the s abb elections came\nforward with campaign manager - New Election, passionately\npersuading IC's electorate not to vote for any of the other candidates.\nMeanwhile, back in good old Beit, puzzled punters mistook a rape\nalarm test for a car alarm; albeit one emanating from a car on the first\nfloor. It now seems anything could happen in IC's own Bermuda\nQuadrangle..\nFELIX22 IHR R9S Birkbeck Safe\nBY ANDYS IN HA RAY Birkbeck College claims to have\n\"not lost a bean\" after being\ncaught out investing in Baring's Bank. The merchant bank, which\nrecently collapsed after over-extension in its derivatives\ntrading, included some \u00a36.5m of\nBirkbeck's investments. Fears\nhad been expressed that the\nmoney could be lost completely.\nAlthough initially reluctant\nto talk to FELIX, a Birkbeck\nspokesman later insisted: 'We\nhave lost nothing'. He later\nconfirmed that their money was\nintact, having been safely\ndeposited in a clearing bank.\nArrangements were made\nlast month with the National\nWestminster Bank to ensure that\nstaff salaries could be paid. A \u00a32m loan was made by the\nHigher Education Funding Council for England ( HE FCE), which has since been paid back.\nIt is also understood that\nBirkbeck College will not now be\nmaking representations for\ncompensation to HE FCE or other\nbodies.\nFELIX was told that\nNatWest had been \"very\naccommodating\" and there is a sense of relief over the incident,\nwhich seems to be considered as\npast history. \"From our position\nit was a bit of a non-event,\"\nBirkbeck insist.\nImperial's own bank is the\nNatWest, and IC's Finance\nDirector Mike Hanson stressed\nthat Imperial has had nothing\nwhatsoever to do with Baring's. However, he said that prior to\ntheir collapse they were a \"solid\nbank... and a good credit risk.\"\nICU Cash-Cut?\nBY ANDREW SMITH Imperial College Union's Clubs\nand Societies are set to curtail\ntheir activities next year with\ntheir funding likely to drop in real terms.\nCollege's sub vent ion, which\nmakes up the vast majority of\nICU's income has (after inflation)\nbeen cut, a move College blames\non their overall financial\nposition. While present budget\nproposals are still not formally\nagreed there is a working assumption that with IC taking a cut in\ntheir budget, ICU will have to do\nthe same.\nSpeaking to FELIX Mike\nHansen, Director of Finance,\npointed out that with increased\ntrade the Union Bookstore and\nother trading outlets should be\nable to increase funding. This is\nnot being taken for granted by\nUnion officials; the latest Union\nFinance Committee calculated its\nspending plans envisaging less\nmoney in real terms.\nTwo of the big losers were\nRag and Community Action, losing just over 30% and 50% of\ntheir budgets respectively. With\nrising paper prices even causing\nmajor printing problems for the\nNews International, Imperial\nCollege's publications also look\nlikely to be hit. Needing \u00a34,000 to\noffset current paper price rises,\nUFC decided to only grant the a \u00a31,000 rise. This is likely to result\nin either a decrease in the size of\nthe publications themselves, or,\nsuggests one insider, to force\nstudents to 'share' their copies of\npublications such as FELIX. Having already agreed to pay\nfor an extra member of ICU's finance staff, College's \u00a38,500\nproposed increase on their\n\u00a3558,000 sub vent ion clearly will\nnot be able to cover inflation.\nDue to taxation changes the\nUnion also faces increased sports\ncosts and a loss of revenue from\ngaming machines further adding\nto depressed financial situation.\nWhile Mr Hansen stressed\nthat present plans had yet to be\napproved by the Rector or the\nBoard of Governors he defended\nthe proposals. The Director of\nFinance stated that in his opinion\nUnion had not been ' d is proportionally disadvantaged'\nfurther suggesting that there was\n'no reason to believe that other\nUnion income will decrease'.\n\n"

    "content": "Standby\n(D invasion of an old wave\nColdly left on the substitutes' bench\nwhilst the British press went in\nsearch of the scene that celebrates\nbugger all, radiohead found\nsolace in an enraptured American\npublic. Hopefully then, the bends,\n(this, their second album) will see\nthem finally accepted here at\nhome.\nRadiohead's Strength lies in\ntheir ability to lead you unsuspecting ly down a sleepy path and\nthen lob in a grenade - 'my iron\nlung' being a stunning case in\npoint. In fact it was the absence of\nthese twists, turns and bloody sharp\nedges that made their first album,\n'pablo honey', such a non event.\nThere's no worries of that sort\nhere though. Thorn's dangerously\nquiet falsetto is swathed in six\nstring barbs. There are few rhyming\ncouplets; these songs are twisted\nstories from a suffering soul, a continuation of the angst of their\nmillstone 'creep' - finally being laid\nto rest. Listen to 'fake plastic trees'\nand then tell me that they are a one song band. Listen to any on,\nand all of, this album.\nSo, this is big. To say that this\nis stadium sized is an indignity (U2,\nSimple Minds, James - go home,\nyou poor country cousins). Why\nthen do I fervently hope that they\nremain sweat filled divers as\nopposed to open air anonymous?\nMaybe because to be cut like this\nwhen claustrophobic is all the more\npoignant. (9)\nemf are one of those bands\nknown more for their antics off the\ndisc than on it. Appearing on the\nfront cover of the Daily Star, taking\necstasy, stuffing limes under their\nforeskins and so on... The elements\nof the list are diverse and\ninteresting, if occasionally less than\nimpressive. And that's not a bad\nway to sum up the musical\nofferings on their eclectic but very\ngood third album, cha cha cha.\n'perfect day' is the perfect\nopener. With a chorus that will reel\nyou in and using everything from\nparty whistles to a big guitar solo,\nthis rocks in the best clich ed meaning of the phrase. But, it's the\nmid-album duo of 'shining' (with\nthe inspired backing of a forty piece\npart of the London Symphony\nOrchestra) and 'bring me down'\nwhere they really shine. Both are\nepic, rock anti-ballads that build\nfrom humble beginnings into rich,\nan the mic finales.\nAlas, the second half of the\nalbum is not nearly as good as the\nfirst half, 'bleeding you dry' is\ntrance-dance dirge, while a few\nothers are a bit too experimental\nfor their own good. Thankfully,\nthings don't end on a downer;\n'glass smash jack' comes brimming\nwith a quick fire rap, machinery-sounding guitars and some spoken\nword verse courtesy of Stephen Fry.\nIf they can stem their lapses\ninto over-diversification then maybe\nEMF will surprise us all with a classic album. In the meantime, this\nwill do nicely. (8)\nFacing a clear choice between\ntheir big brassy pop sound and\nfurther giant steps down the road\nto experimentation, the boo radley's seem to have opted firmly\nfor the former, wake up boo.', their\nnew album, is a collection of songs-to-be-sampled for early morning\nbreakfast shows. Obviously, the\ntitle track is an anthem to anti-insomnia: the perfect way to wake\nup your room mate. But other\nsongs ponder slumber to the extent\nthat sleep seem to lie just beyond\nthe end of each track; a canyon\nwaits to swallow the light of these\nsongs.\nThat's about the only dark\nedge to the album though. Martin\nCarr appears to have left off the\nsideline Mercury Rev listening to\nconcentrate soley on his Beatles\nand Beach Boys collection. At times\nit's almost embarrassing, with Sice\nveering dangerously close to poor\nLennon impersonations as opposed\nto being inspired.\nIn summary, it's a disappointment, in that way that judging\npop music usually returns such a verdict. Perhaps after the genius of\n'giant steps' they needed a breather - 'wake up boo!\" is an\nalbum of breathers; like fresh air\nbut with transparent content. (7)\nApart from being totally anti-racist and an all round nice guy, I knew nothing about apache indian. Until I got bis new album,\nmake way for the indian, I'd only\never heard the single ' boom shack al ak'.I warn you now - if you\nlike that single, you'll probably hate\nthis album.\nradiohead\nThere are three bright\nmoments on the cd. 'bob a' sounds\nlike one of my mum's south\namerican new age tapes - kinda\nmellow and uplifting, 'born for a purpose' starts off sounding like\n'strawberry fields' and ends up as\nreggae, while 'boom shack a lak' is a funky-deep-groove-sex thang.\nHowever, the vast majority of the\nother eleven tracks are typically\ntuneless rap songs, which to my\nuntrained ears sound just like\nshouting over a drum beat. (6)\nMany bands are like\nchameleons - they change their\nmusical colours to suit the\ncorporate surroundings. One could\naccuse American me taller s mind funk of being such a case.\nAfter all, there are a number of\ntracks on their third album, people\nwho fell from the sky, that are not\nunlike 'dirt'-era Alice in Chains\ncompositions, 'seasick' is the\nperfect example; its mellow, drug-hazed vibe underpinned by a dark,\nhaunting streak that emanates\nfrom s lud g ing guitars. But to\ndismiss Mindfunk in this manner\nwould be to do them a disservice.\nAlthough this album is not an easy\nlisten, ultimately you get the feeling\nthat it could end up being a rewarding one. (7)\nI had no idea what mc 900 ft\njesus' new album, one step ahead\nof the spider, would be like, but I'd heard the name somewhere\nbefore. Indie? No. Rock? No. Rap?\nJazz? Getting closer. Don't be put\noff by the MC, the adjective for this\nalbum is cool. Saxes and flutes\nwhirl and soar over gentle hypnotic\nbeats on the first, 12 minute track\nnew moon', creating a chilled out,\ntrance-like ambience.\nThe down side to this album is\nthat it tends to be similar stuff all\nthrough, a common blight on most\ncontemporary music styles. This is\nlate night atmosphere music, an\naccompaniment to other activities.\nWould I buy it? Well, I might record\nit. (7)\nTricky's version of massive\nattack's 'karma coma', entitled\n'overcome' is beautiful: a mysterious floating melody with\nbarely intelligible but definitely\ngorgeous lyrics laid over languid\nback beats. Unfortunately Massive\nAttack choose to throw away the\nmelody in favour of sort rapping\nand rely on the instrumental\nbackdrop. Of the nine remixes on\ntheir new ep, karma coma, the\nPortishead one is the nicest, with its\nsparse, inspiring guitar lines, but\nultimately losing the tune was a bad idea.

Using\ncomplex Al hardware, immersion systems from\nVR specialists New World and their entire back\ncatalogue as input, they will produce a band\nthat is in fact a computer system. It will produce\nmusic and lyrics with music press feedback\nrather than human musicians. Metres of footage\nshot over the next weeks in the Albert Hall will\ninclude 'blue space' (the special effect used by\ntelevision shows such as The Word) as a key\nelement. This will allow imaging systems to\ncontinually mOp the band on to new surround-in gs, be they Brixton Academy or Sun City. Thus,\nconcerts will take place that never happened.\nMusic made from the bones of human music will\nhit the airwaves having only been listened to by\nrecord executives. 'The media, MTV and CD'sit will all disappear,\" said Noah (I think!). \"Every\nband will eventually be replaced by the F3\ncomputer. Only through real-life gigs will fans\nreach an authentic band; Only live music will\ncount\".\nThus the death of Fox Force Five will be the\nrebirth of music. 13\nFox Force Five's final show takes place on\nSaturday, 1st April.

    "content": "THG menu Standby\n^ and snacks for all...\nI'm greedy, but I think of it as just a healthy appetite. I can eat anything\ntasty-sounding, anytime. But an\nimpromptu picnic of chilli-marinaded olives, a South African\nliqueur rather like Baileys,\nkangaroo meat, aubergine pickle\nand chocolate spread at the good\nfood show two weeks ago made\nme distinctly queasy.\nThe show is a bazaar, with a couple of cookery demonstrations\nthrown in. This was a bit of a disappointment - what I wanted\nwas Food and Drink's Jilly in her\nbondage-style finery screeching,\nWhat you get, though, is stall upon\nstall of promotions of the food you\njust don't buy at Sainsburys. Appleflavoured, yoghurt-style soya\npudding, anyone? And if not, how\nabout that sizzling kangaroo meat,\nwhich tastes rather like gamey,\nchewy steak, or some Worcester\n\u00a9 rings of terror\nsauce, evening primrose oil, or\ndried pineapple (organic of\ncourse)?\nI'm not ungrateful, though.\nYou whisk round the stalls\nsampling - there's rather more of a crowd for wine, chocolate and free\nbagels - and subside into a cookery lecture with your churning\nstomach. There you're lulled into\nalmost believing you might nip\nhome and knock up that salmon en\nc route and sea fish platter, with\nhomemade plaited rolls, naturally,\nfor your deserving flat mates. It's a fantasy world for those middle-aged at heart, plus retired couples,\nall out for the trip and the tastes. \u00a9\nThe Good Food Show is held at\nOlympia, west London, every\nspring. Tickets (concession price)\nwere \u00a36.50 this year.\nWhilst it may be becoming\nsomething of an over-used\nmetaphor for the modern\ncondition, the telephone's also a godsend for breaking up\nmonologues. It acts in both\ncapacities in night shift, the socalled 'comedy-thriller' written by\nStephen Dinsdale (Anorak of Fire).\nOur heroine, the spunky\nMaisie (Sarah Brignall), heads in for\nanother evening manning the lines\nfor a mini cab firm. As time passes,\nshe deals with the normal rash of\ncalls and pairs them up with the\nfirm's ragtag collection of drivers,\nwho may or may not get there\ndepending on what's on telly. In\nbetween calls we begin to hear\nsomething of Maisie's life.\nIt's nothing out of the\nordinary. Her social worker\nboyfriend's just walked out after\nfour years and she's trying to give\nup smoking. She even starts on a retrospective task of listing her\nlovers, while various mundane\ncallers interrupt her flow - she\ntakes her chewing gum out for\nthem. Until, well until The\nphone call. It's abusive, but we\nnever know exactly how. We just\nget to watch the colour drain from\nMaisie's cheeks as her eyes start to\nwater in anger and fear. It's an\nuneasy feeling which has been\nutilised by many directors of both\nscreen and stage, but it's one\nwhich seldom fails to grip.\nMaisie's evening continues,\ndigging deeper into schizophrenic\nbouts of terror and positive\nthinking as calls of various\npersuasions ring in and out of her\noffice. Yet there are no big issues\nto be made here. Nightshirt's not a parable, merely a modern tale,\nwell written and acted.\nThe ending has two decent\ntwists to it but the tag 'comedy-thriller' never really fits. Perhaps\nthe simple description of an 'one\nwoman show' should be enough\nfor us. Whatever you want to call it,\nNightshift makes all the right\nconnections and is well worth a visit.\nI was a little wary of seeing\nDrumstick's production of volpone\nwithout knowing much about the\nplay, but thankfully Ben Jonson's Elizabethan farce is not only readily\naccessible, it's also very funny.\nThe plot (and counter plot) sees\nVolpone feigning illness to play on\nthe greed of several Venetian\nworthies, who each believe they\nare likely to inherit the 'dying'\nman's wealth, and are all tricked\ninto giving him gifts to gain his\nfavour. Much mayhem ensues.\nAny criticisms? Well, the rape\nscene didn't work, perhaps\nbecause Jonson's female characters are all either caricatures or\nplot-devices, while the final\nconfrontation seemed to lose its\nway a little. But the biggest\ndisappointment was the small first-night crowd; hopefully the other\nperformances will attract the large\naudiences a production of this\nquality deserves. Q Is kangaroo meat and chocolate spread a bizarre\ncombination?

Everyone has probably seen it but now it's time to reminisce; Hugh\nGrant mouthing expletives, morning suites, brogues and top hats.\nWhen it first came out I was sceptical about the film. However being\nforced to see it by circumstance of my own sister's impending marriage, I was pleasantly surprised. It was a case of perfect casting allowing the film\nto run itself.\nFor those who have yet to see the film it's about a group of friends\nattending the weddings and funeral in question, but with a subplot\ncent ring around Hugh Grant's inability to commit to any woman. Well\nuntil his attention turns to Andie McDowell that is.\nThis is one video to add to your collection. 0\nFour Weddings is available at video stores from March 27th at \u00a314.99.\nMM FELIX22(11 fl R9S "

    "content": "Xtra Curricular\nRag Tour: Members of ICU's Rag Team line up in leg-hair length order\nHill)\nRag Review of Term\nKeys: Chocolate, Keele, Pizza\nHappy Easter everyone. Yes, it is the time of\nyear when we all consume large amounts of\negg-shaped chocolate and have four weeks\nfree of lectures! This is also the time for a lesser known tradition the Rag review of the\nterm. Once again lots of people have raised\nstunning amounts of cash for many well\ndeserving charities and had a great time whist\ndoing this. Many students have also gained\ntheir Rag sweatshirts, T shirts or mugs as\nincentives for collecting.\nThe term began well as some of the Rag\nCommittee had been to the Keele Rag\nConference and were this full of enthusiasm\nand new ideas when we got back to college.\nFirst of all we had a London collection for\nJohn Grooms (a charity for the disabled)\nwhich, despite the rain, raised a fair amount\nof money and earned our top collector of the\nday, Eleanor Tench, a Pizza Hut meal as a prize.\nOn the 4th of February there was the\nannual battle between the halls in the Hall's Dirty Dozen competition. The team from\nBeit Hall won and Chae Martyn was the winning collector, raising over \u00a370 for SCOPE.\nThe top collectors on this event also won\nprizes in the form of music and meal vouch-ers.\nAfter a couple of weeks off collecting we\nwere ready for the major event of the term,\nthe Rag Tour, (see picture). This was a crazy\nweekend mixing Rag Mag selling to fellow\nstudents with social ising and generally having a good time. We managed to cover most\nof the middle/north of England Universities\nin a couple of days without breaking the\nFELIX2 c( HllR9S\nspeed limit so thanks to Tim, Alaric and John\nTurner for doing the driving. All in all it was\na very successful and eventful weekend and\nwe raised the stupendously large sum of over\n\u00a3740 in the space of three days. For some reason the hard core Rag Tour posse who stayed\nuntil the Monday decided to show off their\nlegs to the camera, hence the picture featured\nabove.\nSince then things have calmed down\nslightly but we have still been collecting\namazing amounts of money for charity. On\nthe 3rd of March some of us managed to persuade commuters in a few train stations to\npart with their cash and donate it to the\nCystic Fibrosis trust. Then on the Saturday a few people trundled up to Oxford to go on a Rag Raid and raise some money for Oxfam.\nThis term was a good one for prizes as a couple of collections for the Royal Hospital\nfor Neurodisability in Putney gave participating students the chance to win a three month\nInter-railing holiday for two. The winner of\nthis prize will be announced next term as\nthey are not known at the time of going to\npress.\nThe Rag Mag editors for next years Mag\nwere elected this term so this rather infamous\npublication is already being compiled. If you\nhave any wildly amusing jokes then do let us\nin the Rag Office know, so the Rag Mag for\n1995/6 can be as hilarious as ever. We have\nalso elected a Treasurer and Secretary for\n1995/6 and they are Jon Lambert and Mark\nHarrison, respectively.\nNext term you can look forward to more\nRag madness with the Rag Fete and Dinner\namong other things. Martin Jones is our\nnewly elected Rag Fete co-or d in at or so we\nwish him luck with organising the event! To\nfind out more details of our events next term\nand/or to stand for any of the committee posts\nleft then come to our meetings on Fridays in\nthe Ents Lounge at 1.10pm. Thanks to everyone who has taken part\nin Rag this term and we hope to see you after\nthe holiday.\nI@ QM3.0II> What it you're ill over exams?\nKeys: Doctor, Dentist, Genuine\nWell, it's almost the Easter break and the\ndreaded exams (arr gh!) are looming. But\nwhat, I hear you ask, do you do if you get\nstruck down with a( genuine) disease (exam-in it us does not count!).\nIf you think you are ill enough for its to\naffect your exam performance, this is what\nyou should do:\n\u2022 See your doctor as soon as possible. If\nyour doctor agrees with you (they can tell if\nyou're faking!), you can obtain a doctor's note\nsaying so.\n\u2022 Tell someone in you department. You should take your note to your personal tutor\nor senior tutor. It should then be placed in\nyour records and, if necessary, taken into\naccount in your exam results.\nIf you are ill during your exams and cannot attend them, you must ring in to your\ndepartment and follow the advice above. It is\nalso worth knowing that it is, in the case of\ndental problems, possible to get a sick note\nfrom your dentist.\nSo, stay well and good luck!\nThe Football Tournament Final\nKeys: Iran, Pakistan, Powerful\nAs you all know an OSC football tournament has been taking place for the past five-weeks. After a few postponements, due to\nunfriendly weather conditions, the final\nmatch was played on Wednesday the 8th of\nMarch.\nThe two opposing finalists were Pakistan\nand Iran. Great skill and team work, from\nboth sides, resulted in an action packed\nmatch that ended with a20 score for the\nIranians. The advantage came at the sixth\nminute into the first half when a brilliant\nmove from the Iranian centre back, Hamid\nFallah, resulted in their first goal. From then\nPakistan's team strategy shifted to an all out\nattack searching for the equalise r. This provided them with a few very good goal scoring\nchances, especially in the second half. Fast\nand often powerful defence kept the score\nfrom changing. The second match-deciding\ngoal for the Iranians came in the last minute\nof the match. This was a result of the slackened defence and low spirits of the\nPakistanis.\nSince a team photograph of the winner\n\n"

Hundreds of events, thousands of people...\nand something a bit different from The Arts Catalyst. Set up by two ex-Imperial students\nNicola Triscott (Physics) and Vivienne Glance (Life Sciences), The lifts Catalyst is\nbringing scientists and artists together in a season of events under the title Supernova.\nProjects include a dance production Talking the Sex of Angels and a spoof lecture,\nProfessor A. A. Singleton Guinness (win tickets below). In this month's Physics World,\nVivienne asks: \"If the benefits of science are so obvious, why are fewer students\nchoosing to study it, and why are the EU and UK gove nm ents promoting weeks to its\nunderstanding?\" She highlights as one explanation the often clich ed portrayals of\nscientists by the media. \"Image is one problem, and artists and writers have tended to\nhinder rather than help, often representing the fears of science in reworkings of the\nFrankenstein story.\"\nIn an effort to overcome this image, The Rrts Catalyst have commissioned a dance\npresentation called Talking the Sex of Angels as part of set9 B. The show is inspired by\nthe language and concepts of quantum\nphysics, and scientific input came from\nmembers of Imperial's theoretical\nphysics group.\nSo don't put on a video tonight, try\nTalking the Sex of Angels instead.

The great majority of\nalarms to date have been caused\nas a direct result of cooking\nfacilities, burning candles, joss\nsticks, and persons removing\ndetectors. Although these incidents\nare a nuisance to occupants, they\nare caused by occupants, they are\ngenuine activation s and the fire\nalarm system is performing the\nfunction for which it is designed.\nIt is of interest to note, that\nduring the periods when Residences are let to the public, fire\nalarm activation s are virtually zero.\nThe College is making every\neffort to ensure the safety of\nstudents and staff in all\nenvironments, and the Fire Section\nof the Security Department seeks\nyour assistance in this continuing\ncommitment.\nAll suggestions and comments\nwill be discussed and given\nconsideration, however, College\nhas no option but to work within\nthe frame work of the relevant\nlegislation.\nPlease remember fire, smoke\nand fumes can and do kill. Smoke\nand fume inhalation accounts for\nthe greatest proportion of fire\nrelated deaths each year.\nUpgraded systems are being\ninstalled to protect you. This type\nof full protection is new but\nBUM FELIX22 m f)R9S essential in Halls of Residence, we\nall have to accept a period of\nadjustment.\nKeith Reynolds\nFire/Security Manager.\nWh//e no one doubts your\ncommitment to safety, what is the\npoint of highlighting the lack of\nalarms during public letting s if you\nsay that you recognise that student\noccupancy is different? How can a system that has been activated due\nto ordinary cooking or because of\nshowers be suitable for student\nhalls? Using legislation to defend\nthe changes is one thing, but is the\nprime objective of the new system\nthe protection of students or the\nlegal provision for the Accommodation Office to operate halls as\nhotels during student vacations ?\nFiam/Marcus !\nDear Felix,\nSimon Baker, it seems, is doing\nhimself a great disservice. In last\nweek's issue he claimed to be\nunable to understand what, or my\nassociate, were talking about; and\nyet his letter betrays the fact that\nhe has a great understanding of\nour writings. He seems to know at\nleast as much as I do about Yves\nKlein, and he is able to discuss the\nworkings of Frater Fiam's articles\nwith a high level of erudition. So\nwhy does he want to claim that I and the Frater are incomprehensible and meaningless? One\ncan only assume that he is\nsuffering from peer pressure, that\nhis less than intelligent friends\nhave spent the last year\nharanguing him about his love of\nintelligentsia. Thus, in a feeble\nattempt to gain some street-c red, Mr Baker has written this bizarre\nletter in which he firstly claims that\nFrater Fiam writes \"purple prose\nwhich says absolutely nothing\"\nthen continues by explaining how\nhe disagreed with the topic of the\nFrater's previous column. Surely if\nMr Baker really found the Frater's articles meaningless, then he could\nnot argue about the topics\ncontained within them?\nMore importantly however,\nthere are a few inaccuracies that I must rectify. Mr Baker's claim that I am the Frater is unfounded and\nblatantly untrue. I am no more the\nFrater than Kurtz is Conrad, and\nhis writings are not my\nresponsibility. On his behalf\nhowever, I must point out he never\ntalked of the common cold as\n\"some kind of pleasure inducing\ndrug\". He merely stated that they\nprovide \"mental influence\" which\n\"can sometimes be useful.\". And\non another point, neither I nor my\ngood and esteemed Frater are\ninclined to use Roget's Mega, or\nany other thesaurus, for we have\nno need of them.\nI am well aware that the\nFrater's work is seen by the lazy\nand naive as \"utter drivel\";\nhowever, anyone who actually\nbothered to read them carefully\nwould discover that each one\ncontains a wealth of information.\nAdmittedly, much of it is hidden or\ndescribed obtusely, but it is not\nbeyond the means of the average\ndegree student to see through such\ndisguises. So if Mr Baker spent his\ntime actually reading the Frater's columns rather than providing us\nwith his poorly constructed\nwitticisms, then he might just find\nthat it is his life, and not just Felix,\nwhich is much improved this year.\nYours, Marcus Alexander\n/ cannot discuss Frater's in comprehensibility, as my claim to fame is\nnever having read past the first\nparagraph of any of his epics, but\nthen maybe I am 'lazy and naive'.\nMarcus though can be quite\ninteresting, when understandable.\nKevin Speaks\nDear Owain,\nAs I haven't been elected, I had\nbetter come clean about my real\npolicies :-taxing of lectures in order to\nsubsidize beer. Pay as you learn I use library resources as an\nextra form of heating in the union\nbar.\nbanning of the word \"sex\" in\ncollege unless a demonstration\naccompanies.\n1/3 of male population should\nhave a sex change, in order to\nkeep numbers even.\npillows, blankets, and carpet\nslippers to be supplied to all\nlecture theatres.\nmortgage off the Sherfield\nBuilding in order to buy a brewery.\nlobby parliament to introduce\nsheep onto Hyde Park.\nThis is in response into Marcus\nAlexander's article saying that no\npresidential candidates have any\npolicies.

(Lost)\nYeah go for it Kev !\nEdited this week by\nAndrew Smith\nOSC Fight ?\nDear Felix,\nAs overseas students at Imperial\nwe wish hereby to thank Messrs.\nSinner, Dua and Samarasingle for\ntheir highly informative and\nilluminating letter in Felix 1024\n('Night of the long knives').\nWere it not for this letter, we\nwould never have found out that\nthree members of the exec, of our\nCommittee consider that the exec.\nChairman has a 'distinctly\ndisorganised way of handling\naffairs' and a 'lack of\ncommunication', and makes public\nstatements they claim are 'not\ntrue'. We would never have found\nout that they have been forming\nthis opinion 'throughout the year'.\nAnd we would never have found\nout that, while they thought that\n'this d is organisation became even\nmore obvious during the last week\nof preparations for International\nNight', they failed for reasons\nundisclosed to tender their\nresignations at that time with effect\nafter the end of International\nNight. This would have given\nthem the opportunity to separate\ntheir responsibilities while still\nmaking their services available to\nthe exec, for the organisation of\nInternational Night, and was the\nonly decent course of action their\nstated opinion would have allowed\nthem if discharging their duty to\nthe people who elected them was\ntheir priority.\nWere is not for this letter, we\nwould have been unaware that we\nhad elected to the exec, of our\nCommittee persons so totally\nunconcerned with the status of that\nexec, as the representative body of\nImperial overseas students that\nthey would sign a letter alleging\nthat its competence was compromised by a Chairman they consider\nlacking in the necessary skills, IN\nTHEIR CAPACITIES AS ELECTED\nMEMBERS OF THAT EXEC!\nThus we would never have\nfound out that at least three of the\npeople elected to represent\nImperial overseas students seem to\nassume that the OSC exec, is an\noligarchy entitled to use the\ncapacities of the posts they have\nbeen democratically elected to in\nbackstage machinations, and that\nthe people they represent and are\naccountable to are either morons\nor so apathetic it makes no\ndifference.\nBut who knows?

    "content": "no lists o rotation\nTwo statements concerning art\nand the holocaust confront you on\nentering after auschwitz. The\nfirst, \"to write a poem after\nAuschwitz is barbaric\", may give\nthe exhibition a title but it also\nopens the way to its main criticism.\nThe holocaust, as an artistic\nconcept, is something so powerful\nthat too often it is used to promote\nbad art, rather than good art\nbeing used to confront the ghosts\nof the past and spirits of the\nfuture. The other phrase is, \"how\nis one to speak of it? how is one\nnot to speak of it?\". Between these\ntwo lies an dilemma which few\nartists appears to realise.\nSome of the exhibits fall into\nthis trap. A single suitcase, with\nthe title 'this suitcase is aryan', has\nno meaning outside of the\nexhibition. Indeed the only power\nit possesses is drawn from the fact\nthat it's in an exhibition about the\nholocaust. As an artifact it says\nnothing universal about the why\nor how. In part this kind of failure\nis inherent in the exhibition's philosophy too. As a contemporary\nexhibition, After Auschwitz only\nuses art made within the last\ndecade. Yet the most powerful\nimages tend to come from those\nartists like Zoran Music, who\nactually endured the camps\nthemselves. Music's figures are\ngrotesque and twisted, in a way\nthat the younger artists' perfection\nand skill seems to belittle.\nPerhaps it's fitting that the\nmost powerful image in the\nexhibition is a photograph,\nconsidering that this was the\nmedium which revealed the\ncamps' existence to a disbelieving\nworld in the first place. H. Langenheim's black and white\nphotographs revisit the husks of\nthe concentration camps as they\nare now. The best print, 'entrance\nto undressing room of gas\nchamber and crematorium II',\nshows the flooded steps leading\ndown underground. It's more\narresting than any pictures of\nskulls or deserted shoes because\nthe buildings remain fixed in\ngeographic and historical terms.\nWhereas suitcases need frightened\nmasses to give them meaning, the\nsignificance of buildings of mass\ndestruction is held in solitude.\nAfter Auschwitz is a strange\nmix of good, worthy and trashy\nbut, in a strange way, reading the\nvisitors' book tells you more about\ncontemporary attitudes.

    "content": "Feature Feature\nHealth is no longer just a medical matter. Nowadays it is recognised\nthat social and cultural factors have provided a form of health management. A more holistic\napproach to health, in terms of prevention,\npromotion, cure and rehabilitation, places the\nphysical and mental well-being of people as\nfirst priority.\nThe major health problems of the\ndeveloping world stem from poverty. There are\nclear links between a poor environment and ill\nhealth. In the developed world the more\ncommon environmental hazards to health have\npractically all been eliminated, and so people\ntend to die from genetic diseases or cancers.\nAs countries become more industrialised, some\nhealth risks are alleviated, and others become\nprominent. In many places, environmental\nfactors are the greatest culprits, enabling some\nproblems to be treated.\nHealth care, at its most basic level, does\nnot require medical special is ation. It can be\ndone through preventative health and welfare\nprogrammes, community nursing, and health\neducation in schools. Basic health care\nprogrammes of this nature ought to be\nwidespread. Sadly, they are not. There are still\nover 1 billion people in the world who do not\nhave access to drinkable water, and nearly 2\nbillion do not have minimal sanitation facilities.\nE is the\n\u2022 crucial nv iron merit factor in\nhuman health and disease. Around 80 per cent of all\ncancers, for example, are caused by\nenvironmental conditions, including diet and\nsmoking. Since many aspects of our\nenvironment are under our control, arguably\nmuch disease is preventable by changing the\nenvironment. Managing the environment ha5* a* major impact on preventing illness and\npromoting good health. ,\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth\ncentury, most deaths in the Western world were\nfrom diseases such as tuberculosis, smallpox,\ntyphoid, dysentery and cholera. Marty of these\nwere dramatically reduced with the introduction\nof clean water supplies and improved sewerage\nsystems. ~\nEndemic infectious diseases also declined\nwith better food hygiene, housing and working\nconditions. Advances in agriculture led to\nimprovements in diet, which enhanced\nresistance to disease. Changes such as these\nhad a far gre q jer effect than medical\ntreatments such as sul ph or fct eWes, df iri bro tics and vaccines. * \u00ab~ r* In developing countries, ho v infectious diseases still dominate. Since the\nmajor killers like diarrhoea, cholera and\ntyphoid are trans mf n^d^ ft f as^ es, the ni\u00bbst <H effective firs f inter ve if fim. is to imt lp ve J be^ water supplies and sanitation. The Wr\nestimates that the cost of providing a dt qu u io water and sanitation services is about Si5 per\nFELIX22 m nR95 person per year. This seems a small price to\npay for such an increase in quality of life, but it\nquickly mounts up when you consider that you\nwould be catering for almost 2 billion people.\nNext to these infectious diseases, you\nmay wonder why AIDS is given such\nprominence as a major killer in developing\ncountries. It is not yet a major cause of death\nprotected by clean air legislation, smokeless\ntechnology an'd use of alternative fuels. Air\npollution is still a major problem in former\nEastern European countries, however, where\nuncontrolled emissions of sulphur dioxide have\nled to high rates of respiratory illness and\nmortality. Air pollution has caused one-quarter\nof all respiratory-related deaths in Czech\nas alternative liquid or gas fuels at affordable\nprices.\nAnother environmental effect that is\ncausing worldwide concern is the depletion of\nthe ozone layer. This has been correlated to\nthe rise in the incidence of skin cancer in\nWestern countries. The protective layer of\nozone in the stratosphere absorbs ultra-violet\nThe best precautions are to wear\nprotective clothing and wide-brimmed hats, and\nto avoid the midday sun. The use of sunscreen\nlotions is deceptive in that they rub off easily\nduring movement or sweating; and although\nthey may reduce the risk of burning, they do\nnot protect against the immuno suppress ive effects of UV radiation.\nWARNING\nthe dose and the risk of leukaemia failed to\naccount for the clusters. Furthermore, no\nevidence could be found to support the\npossibility that the children's fathers had been\nexposed to high doses of radioactivity at work\nat the place prior to conception.\nThe research team investigating the\nclusters also studied the incidence of leukaemia\nin places earmarked as potential nuclear sites.\nThese also had elevated childhood leukaemia s, even though the nuclear plants had not yet\nbeen built.\nLiving on Earth can seriously damage\nyour health\nR emote rural\nworldwide, but it is a major killer in l^ ie most\neconomically productive as j fc gPl bp. In some\ncities in Africa, the prevalence of .-.'OS is as\nhigh as 30 per cc: it.

    "content": "Feature\nDeath without Question\nMichael Ludlam investigates suicide and the e nameless people who diss app eaf The date is April 8th1994. The place Seattle. The\nbody of a man in his late twenties is found in\nhis house, dead from a self inflicted gun wound\nto the head. Not,\nunfortunately, an\nuncommon occurrence,\nexcept that this man was\nfamous - Kurt Cobain.\nFamous for hating his fame;\nthis the final rejection of\neverything. He supposedly had it all; a wife, a child, millions of dollars. And the media turned\nhis death into a feeding frenzy. It was if this\nkind of thing didn't happen too often. However\nin Britain in the week that he died around 90\npeople took their own lives. It is estimated that\none thousand people kill themselves everyday worldwide.\nIn industrialised nations such as\nBritain, suicide rates among young\nmen are rocketing. If this was a disease, there would be a national\noutcry.\nThe attitude to suicide worldwide seems\nto follow a very British tradition: \"We don't talk about that sort of thing\". The phrase 'to\n\u2022m1 'Wkd, com m't suicide\"\nsounds like it is a crime, as indeed it was\nin Britain until 1961.\n(It was only de-criminal is ed in Ireland\ntwo years ago). There\nare stories in the 19th Century of people being\nrevived after attempting suicide only to be\nexecuted. People were hanged for suicide. As\nrecently as 1950 a woman was given a jail sentence for attempting to kill herself. Thankfully this bizarre way of\ndealing with those who give up on life\nhas ceased.\nSadly though, the secret ness carries on. While there is no denying\nthat suicide is an extremely personal act, there\nis a very public statement in each one. It is this\npublic statement that is so often ignored. How\nmany people talk to their friends about suicide?\nNot many I am sure even though I know that\neverybody reading this article has thought\nabout it. Not necessarily their own suicide but\ncertainly why someone else\nwould take their own life.\nAn odd situation that has\narisen, we shun the act itself\nbut have a strange\nfascination with the person\ninvolved. They become\nidols, made heroes and gods once dead. Sylvia\nPlath was virtually an unknown poet before she\nput her head in a gas oven and killed herself.\nNow she is famous, famous in her posthumous\nlife, and mostly for her death and fascination\nwith it.\nBut for most suicide is not the final act.\nFor many it is a cry for help, when there is no\nwhere else to turn. It is a last resort for those\nwho feel their back is against the wall. It is a surprising fact that most attempted suicides are\nnot intended to be final. Gender is an\nimportant factor: more women attempt suicide\nthan men but men are approximately six times\nmore likely to succeed. The choice of method\nfor men is often a lot more final: guns and\nhanging. Women are more likely to take drugs.\nMen tend to be more determined while women\ncan be easily persuaded from it. There is a story\nof a woman who on her way to the Severn\nbridge was stopped by a couple who asked her\nfor directions. Able to tell them, she felt she\ncould do something with her life, changed her\nmind and went home. For men crying for help\nis not a socially acceptable solution. Their\nmethods are more often irreversible.\nMeasuring the rates of suicide is hard. It\nis generally accepted that the official statistics\nare only a fraction of the real figures. This is\nnot helped by the Irish coroner who\ncommented on one man's death: \"Sure, he was\nonly cleaning the muzzle of the gun with his\ntongue.\" However the statistics of student\nsuicide are surprisingly accurate. It has always\nbeen assumed that students are more likely to\nkill themselves than any other group, however\nthis is not the case. Universities are normally\nvery coy about discussing student suicide,\nthough one, Oxford University, has published a report which compared student suicide rates\nwith Oxford City. It found that if all the 'open\nverdicts' of the equivalent age group were\nadded then the difference with the student rate\nalmost disappeared. Students have always seen\nto be more vulnerable than most other groups\nin the population because they are far more\nvulnerable to emotional and psychological\nproblems as they come to college. For most\ncollege is an exciting experience, but for a small\nnumber it is far too hard to cope with, academic\nstress as well as interaction with other students\ncan often become unbearable.\nSo who are all these people? If there really\nare a thousand people succeeding in taking\ntheir own lives how many are there 'failing'?\nWho are all these nameless people and where\nare they disappearing too? It is important not to\nlook at suicide as something that you can\neradicate. Suicide isn'ta disease. There are no\nanswers, especially for the friends and family\nleft behind. It is something that appears to be\nso unpredictable and unstoppable that we are\nleft helpless. Maybe if we weren't so taboo\nabout suicide we could personally do something\nabout it.

Two conflicting letters from\nGliding Club hit the letters pages leaving no-one any the wiser.\nMeanwhile the previously sane people who had mutated into election\ncandidates were now fielding both flan s and questions from the Mary's Medics. The C&G elections came and went with barely a whimper,\nand a7% turnout: \"less and late publicity\" was one reason given. In\nanother suburb of Election City, Ghassan Karian was elected UL U President, admitting that he'd occasionally tell \"fibs\" though\npromising he'd try to be honest most of the time. Elsewhere, JapanSoc\nboycotted International Night and criticised the OSC chair's handling\nof the event, saying that they didn't get early enough notice. \"Nobody\nelse had problems, nobody else has complained,\" the OSC chair\nAndreas Mershin said as he stumbled over pride on the way to a fall.\nFELIX 1024-E Results!

FELIX1024 The morning-after-the-night-before, and the elections still refused to\nleave FELIX alone. The St Mary's Union defended the block vote,\nwhere students seem to have been openly advised on how to choose\ncandidates (in stark contrast to IC where students seemed to have been\nopenly advised on how to avoid voting completely). A mere 17%\nturned out. Against fierce background controversy, International\nNight was a sell-out success - although Andreas Mershin \"didn't expect it to go so well\". DoC was targeted once again by thieves, whilst\nthe Linstead Fire Alarms screamed at the faintest whiff of smoke. The\nWarden said the \"ridiculous\" system was effectively \"life threatening\nbecause nobody takes it seriously anymore.\" In another development,\nfurious research staff were asked to waive rights after changes made to\ntheir terms and conditions by college.\nFELIX1025 Errm...\nMM FELIX H2N1 RR9S News in Brief\nBY LYNN BRAVE Y OSC Makes Up\nThe Overseas Societies\nCommittee (OSC) seem to have\nresolved their differences\nfollowing huge rows cent ring on\nthe organisation of International\nNight.

In the end national interest\nprevailed, and the Treaty ended up being\nessentially a compromise. It failed to consider\nthe average European citizen, who was left to\nswing between shallow Euro-sce pt is m and\nconstructive criticism. The democratic deficit,\narising due to the unmatched expansion of\nthe Parliament's rights - compared to the pace\nof transfer of authority - from member states\nto the Community, did not seem to have been\nfilled. By the end of 1992 it sci-in ed.! \u2022> i; something had gone badly wrong, a sharp\ncrisis on European optimism was manifested\nin every possible way across the Continent :\nreferendum^, populist cries and the E.R.M. debacle.\nE.U. member states are required to be\npluralist democracies; it should follow that\nany organisation they create will be\ndemocratic too, and indeed such a political\nstructure exists alongside the instruments of\neconomic policy in the E.U. But at present\nthis political structure allows mainly for the\nrepresentation of the member state, rather\nthan the citizen. Hence it cannot incorporate\nany truly European opinion and perspective;\ninstead discord and compromise between the\nstates shape common policies. Citizens need a political system which provides a platform of\nexpression and an executive arm for the\nmajority opinion across Europe. Only then\nwill a genuinely European interest play a role\nin steering the Continent.\nThe present structure is also accused of\ninadequate accountability and a lack of\nopenness: too many decisions affecting the\nlives of ordinary people are taken in Brussels\nbehind closed doors. One reason for this is\nii tiP wIg J Dw nh ff t the ITU? st n wire) a IBf at a J gp malle vj el,and i jj| eir decisions\naffecting the Union cannot be fully controlled\nb v the o the io ig jn s. This has been one ol the\np ww* WVA: . y;^ \u00ab s<; \u2022& AAI:ZA\nnational or supranational, can function\nwithout its citizens' loyalty. As David Hume\nrealised in the sixteenth century: \"power lies\nwith the governed\". The citizens of any state\nmust be given ground to identify themselves\nwith the state's governmental system and be\nsure that their interests are properly and\nadequately represented. The present system is\n'seriously lacking in this respect, let alone the\nlack of a sense of common fu t me and identity\namongst Europeans; the combined effect has\ngloved to be very dangerous.\nThere have been some moves towards\ntransparency and democrat ts ation within the\nEuropean Institutions. The Treaty of\nMaastricht enhanced the European\nParliament'sp consul i. il inn and i hc right of co-decision with\nthe ('\nCommission also decided to release to the\nprocess during the preparation and drafting of\n\u2022;r, quite\ninadequate and do not set the way from the\nperiod till 2020; \"the institutional structure\nwhich results from the new Treaty contains\nsuch deficiencies that it is very doubtful\nwhether the Union will be in a position to\nachieve its stated goals.\"\nThe intergovernmental conference in1996 is an opportunity to deal with the\nshortcomings of the Treaty. In particular, the\nprinciple of subsidiarity must be clearly\ndefined. Cooperation in the areas of Justice\nand Internal Affairs must be included and,\nmost importantly, the European Parliament\nmust be given the right of legislative\ninitiative. Furthermore it is the joint\nresponsibility of the Commission and the\nnational parliaments to begin to draft the\nfuture European Constitution, containing an\nexplicit and extensive reference to the future\nEuropean Parliament.\nThe following steps j jps si occur bet ww n before 2020:\ni. Ihere should be a gradual shift of power\nfrom the Council of Ministers to the\n\u2022 . . \u2022 -nt oi the future United Europe\n, 2. Tfoe European Parliament must be\nallowed democratic control over the\nCommission and ultimately appoint the\nCommission itself.\n3. Cross-border cooperation between\npolitical parties should be fostered, so that the\nelections for the Parliament will begin to\nchange from being essentially a kind of\nnational election, to ultimately become the\npodium where European parties are judged\nand elected to represent pan-european\nideologies and interests.\n4. The Council of Ministers should\nultimately act as an advisory body to the\nCommission and the Parliament.\ni|5. National parliaments should exercise\ndemocratic control within the states, thus\ncomplementing the p.ul i a ment ary tasks of the\nEuropean Parliament at a Union level. There\nshould be a demarcation line between the\nCommission and national governments, set by\nlegislation referring to the principle of\nsubsidiarity.\nThrough scheme described above the\nE.P. will begin to act, both as a source of\npolitical will towards further integration, and\nas a forum where political differences over the\nUnion's future can be aired. This will encompass all different perspectives over the\nfuture of the Continent. All new legislation\nshould be as clear and concise as possible - to\navoid the setbacks experienced with the\nMaastricht Treaty.\nFor me the most important short-term\nneed for the future of the European Union, is\nto present a new pan-european perspective\ncatering for all Countries aspiring to share\ninterest, opinion and beliefs over the crucial\nproblems of the Continent. This would be a blueprint for the united Europe as a whole. Qj\nKyriakos Hatzaras\nI.C Delegation to the Europe \"2020\" Seminar\nChairman ofthe Societyfor European Youth\n\n"

Her speciality is\ncontemporary music: she has had pieces written for her by James MacMillan and\nMichael Nyman, and there are plans for her to premiere works by Gorecki and\nRobert Saxton. The Elgar concerto which she performed at the recent ic so concert is perhaps, new territory for her. Although warm in the central Andante,\nher tone was occasionally wiry in the outer movements and her attack\nsometimes a little scrappy.\nICSO have played Elgar before, but never with such a fine string section.\nThere may have been a few people in the audience unaware of the track record\nof Richard Dickens and his players, but any misgivings they might have had\nwould have been immediately reassured by the strong surge of the opening tutti.\nNeither orchestra nor soloist gave in to the temptation to wallow in the more\nnostalgic passages. Further rapport between Mitchell and ICSO was perhaps\ninhibited by a lack of opportunity for instrumental dialogue in Elgar's writing.\nAfter some impromptu flamenco in the first half, in the form of the soloist's rather audible foot tapping, the second half finished with the sensuous ballet\nmusic of Ravel's 'daphnis and chloe suite no.2'. Before this was Britten's 'sinfonia da requiem'...\nTo the un versed reader, classical music critique might seem to be tuned to a pointless note demanding wasted effort to understand. So I 'll leave that to the\npros and programs. To me an orchestra is like a living organism, the musicians\nits cells. When a cell malfunctions the entire organism suffers. ICSO performed\nElgar alongside Madelaine Mitchell, an alien body, and it showed. But the\nsecond half brought redemption. A chest-thumping opening drum-roll\nannounced the fluid waves of sound which where to ensue. Benjamin Britten's 'sinfonia da requiem' was executed with tort u rous vigour. The 'opus no. 20'\nspends the majority of its duration faltering its players, before the (brief)\ncrescendo at the end, leaving you petering on the edge of a rhythmic cliff. A round of traditional applause provided a short prelude to 'suite no 2' of Ravel's 'daphnis and chloe'.

Tim\nRobbins is more humourous\ncompared to his previous roles but\nas usual he shows his acting\nversatility. The most disappointing\nperformance comes from Meg\nRyan, typecast once again as the\nlady looking for love. Stephen Fry\nplays a very British character; ie\nStephen Fry once again plays\nStephen Fry.\nIQ does not tax the mind at\nall; turn up, sit down, pass out.\nSome scenes are hilarious and well\nset up. In particular the Princeton\nbackdrop adds to the atmosphere\nof the film and seeing Einstein on\nthe back of a motor bike is a novelty no one can miss. Not!!\njust cause tells the story of a young black man (Blair Underwood)\nwho claims he has been falsely\nimprisoned for the rape and brutal\nmurder of a young white girl eight\nyears ago. With the help of his\ngrandmother he contacts Paul\nArmstrong (Sean Connery), a Harvard law professor who is\nstrongly opposed to the death\npenalty. Armstrong eventually\nagrees to see the man and so a story unfolds in which the convicted\nman claims he was kept awake and\nbeaten until he confessed. What's more a religious psycho in the\nsame jail admitted to him that he\nwas the killer.\nArmstrong begins to investigate and interviews the other\nprison inmate who claims to be the\nmurderer - during which the man\nquotes a verse from the bible which\nleads Armstrong to the murder\nweapon. This, along with a letter\nwhich was supposedly written to\nthe parents of the murdered child\nwhile the man was in prison, are\nenough to secure the release of the\nwrongly convicted Underwood.\nEverything seems fine until\nArmstrong receives phone calls\nwhich begin to point to the fact that\nhe has just released a guilty man.\nUnderwood, now free, begins to\nseek revenge on Armstrong's wife\nfor her part in an earlier conviction.\nThe plot's unoriginal up to the\npoint where Underwood is\nreleased, (innocent guy imprisoned,\nanother prisoner claims to have\ndone the murder; it's a little too\nShawshank Redemptionish) but the\ntwist at the end make up for it, if\nnot leaving you slightly confused as\nto who is guilty.\ndrop zone begins as two US\nmarshals, Pete Nessip (Wesley\nSnipes) and his brother Terry\n(Malcom-Jamal Warner), escort a convicted computer hacker, Earl\nLeedy, to a federal prison by plane.\nDuring a mid-flight hijack there's an on-board explosion; Pete has\nhis prisoner snatched and fails to\nsave the life of his brother.\nThe film moves rapidly from\none action sequence to the next,\nbut the acting is mostly of the\nphysical kind. This and the pace of\nthe film leave little opportunity for\ncharacter development. For\nexample hardly any time is devoted\nto Pete's grief over the death of his\nbrother before he goes undercover\nin the world of sky-diving to find\nthe people responsible. You see,\nPete believes that the people\ninvolved in the hijack are expert\nskydivers who managed to make\ntheir escape by parachute.\nBecause of the sky-diving\nscenes, Drop Zone will undoubtedly\nbe much compared with Point\nBreak. Nevertheless, the sky-diving\nscenes are still exhilarating to\nwatch and are perhaps the closest\nyou'll ever get to experiencing the\nthrill of the sport without having to\ncarry out the jumps yourself. One\ncan't help but smile at Pete's initial\nskydiving attempts and at the\npetrified Earl Leedy repeatedly\nbeing forced to skydive as a means\nof getting him to cooperate with his\nkidnappers.\nFollowing his previous roles in\nsuch films as Passenger 57 and\nDemolition Man, Wesley Snipes is\nsurely emerging as an action hero\nwho is comparable to Stallone and\nSchwazenegger. Indeed, he plays\nthe part of Pete Nessip with great\naptitude.\nThere's no denying it, Drop\nZone is a no-nonsense, no-brains-required action flick; if action is\nwhat you desire, I can guarantee\nthat it will not disappoint. 0\ndrop zone\n22I Hfl R95 FELIX "

    "content": "News\nNo New Election\nBY JOHN SINNER AND ANDREW SMITH This year's newly elected\nsabbaticals almost lost their jobs\nbefore they began as last\nTuesday's Imperial College\nUnion (ICU) Council ran close to\nordering a rerun of the elections.\nWith one member changing\nhis vote during a second count,\nthe decision rested with the\nCouncil Chair. John Durrell,\npermanent chair of ICU Council,\ntook the pivotal decision of\nrejecting the motion, which\ncondemned the elections and\nproposed a fresh ballot. Moments\nearlier Stian Ingebrethsen, the\nAeronautics Academic Rep. and\nattending his first meeting, asked\nfor an explanation of the motion.\nAs a result, he changed his vote.\nPiers Williams proposed the\nmotion, seeking a rerun of the\nelections and asking Council to\n'declare a vote of no confidence\nin the Elections Committee for\nfailing to adhere to the cons-t it uti on'. Piers, who manned the\nSt. Mary's Union ballot box, cited\ntwo incidences where students\ndirectly asked him who they were\nblock voting for.\nThe medics defended their\naction, reported in FELIX1024, of distributing hundreds of\n'sample voting papers' to their\nstudents, on the grounds that\nMary's voting procedures were\ndifferent to those of ICU. This\nslip featured the names of the\nactual candidates as an 'example'\nof how to fill in the ballot papers.\nPiers Williams, sitting on\nCouncil as Publications Board\nChair, argued that these 'sample\nvoting papers' signed by Claire\nMaloney and Rah ul Joshi, St\nMary's President and Vice\nPresident, constituted a form of\nUnion 'media'.\nThe motion before Council\nalso stated that the position of an\nICU Exec Committee member on\nthe Elections Committee was\nunconstitutional. The ICU President, Lucy Chothia, has\nnow admitted that this is true,\nsaying: \"the Constitution was\ndefinitely broken\". She earlier\napologised: \"I definitely made a mistake.\" Lucy insisted that this\nhad not affected the result of the\nsabbatical elections.\nAfter heated debate, a count\nwas called, resulting in 15 voting\nfor a rerun of the elections and 14\nothers insisting that the elections\nwere constitutional. As the\nimplication of having to rerun\nthe ballot dawned, a more careful\nrecount proceeded with the one\nchange of vote resulting in a14 all draw. John Durrell, Council\nChair, was then called on to made\nthe casting decision, saving IC\nfrom another election.\nLast Friday Imperial College saw the private launch of National Science\nWeek 1995 (SET95) writes John Sinner. It features a series of events\norganised by the British Association for the Advancement of Science.\nMinisters for both Science and Technology and Agriculture, David Hunt and\nWilliam Waldegrave, were amongst the VIPs who participated in the launch\nin a marquee in Princes Gardens, which even featured a presentation by\nIBM. As part of SET95, IC was the site for the 'BAYSDAY', pictured\nabove, the British Association's Youth Section's annual event. It was open to\n8-18 year olds and featured \"Balloons, Bubbles and Boomerangs\".\nNews Review\nFebruary\nDays of Beit bar break-ins, computer heists and\nyes, electioneering, as politicians came and went,\nsome never to return...\nFELIX1 Q19 \"Shallow, abusive, personalised and inconsequential\" said LabSoc\nguest Tony Benn, not of ConSoc but of the current political system.\nElsewhere pro-Euro Tory David Hunt spoke to an audience of Eurosceptic ConSoc members. A student was threatened with prison for\nalleged GB H( in a separate incident). Election fever began to not so\nmuch hot up as tepid up with rumours propagating wildly over who\nwould be standing. ' FEEL SIK' and ' FI DO' appeared: one claiming\nthat DP(C&S) Ian Parish is an alien. ICU is in Beit Quad, remember.\nFELIX1 Q2Q Back in reality, Beit Quad powered back into the headlines with a vengeance after the Union Bar was raided by students of King's College London (KCL). Ghassan Karian, prospective UL U president\nand Labour councillor, also President of KCL SU, now believes\nmascot ry to be \"toss\" (despite displaying an interest earlier in the\nyear). The NUS also dropped by - to persuade Council of the benefits\nof affiliation. And Election 'Fever' rose from tepid to positively lukewarm as the first candidates signed up.\nFELIX1 Q2T Confession! KCL' s Cllr/President Kari an admitted that he'd knowingly misled ICU over the bar break-in: he'd handed over the\nkeys for the minibus used in the raid. Denying that he'd lied over the\nincident, he preferred to say that a 'collective cover-up decision' had\nbeen made. Students were denied a referendum on the NUS issue on\ntechnicalities, one being the upcoming s abb elections. (A technicality\nwhich had candidates declaring themselves all over the shop). Political\ninactivity of a different kind saw ConSoc snubbing another Tory MP.A furious Theresa Gorman wandered around college with no-one to\nmeet her. ConSoc said there was a \"breakdown in communication with\nMrs Gorman's private office.\"\nFELIX1022 It was the turn of computing students to put their feet up, Aero style,\ndue to a \u00a330,000 theft of computers. Election papers came down,\ncampaigning began in earnest, and the campus was deluged with a rain\nforest's worth of posters. Meanwhile, the C&G election preamble\nwasn't doing quite so well... Back at ConSoc, Lord Archer arrived,\ndeclaring the publicly advertised meeting private. Consequently his\nfascinating views of sex scandals, John Major and his own salary went\nun reported. Gliding Club also had their newest aircraft publicised\nwith infamous inaccuracy...\n22m HR95 FELIX "

As your guest editor\npointed out correctly, that letter\nwas a mistake. We should have\ntried to settle our differences within\nthe OSC in the first place, instead\nof dragging them out into the\npublic and into Felix.\nFollowing a discussion last\nFriday, everybody is reconciled and\nOSC exec will hopefully be able to\nwork well until the end of this year.\nJohn Sinner\nRahul Dua\nDuncan Samarasinghe\nDear Sir or Madam,\nFirst of all I would like to point\nout that International Night '95\nwas a sold out success and a tribute to the multicultural and truly\ninternational nature of IC's academic community. For this\nevent to happen, students from all\nparts of the world had to work\ntogether, in order to introduce and\neducate a wide and diverse\naudience to the cultures of their\nhome countries. It so happened\nthat students coming from\ncountries that have been in open or\nconcealed conflict for more time\nthan anyone can remember,\nworked side by side proving once\nmore that it is the governments\nthat do the wars and not the\npeople.\nThe Overseas Students'\nCommittee was in charge of\norganising the event and as it is\nonly natural during the\norganisation of an event of such\nmagnitude, there were arguments,\nanxiety, stress and some good\nlaughs as well.\nReferring to the letter in last\nweek's FELIX: 'Night of the Long\nKnives', I must point out that the\nOSC exec, officers that signed the\nletter have apologised for acting at\nthe heat of the moment and during\nan OSC exec, meeting last Friday\nwe managed to resolve all matters\nthat have led to their letter. I must\nadmit that the stress of setting-up\nthe largest-student organised event\nof IC got us and there was a temporary breakdown in communication between some of us.\nHowever, we are now back on\nline with a St. Patrick's Day Disco in\nthe MDH (Sherfield Building) today,\norganised jointly with the\nKensington Committee for\nFriendship of Overseas Students\n(KCFOS). entrance is \u00a32 for OSC or\nKCFOS members if bought in\nadvance from 14 Princes Gardens\nor \u00a33 at the door. There are prizes\nto be won.\nsincerely yours,\nAndreas Mershin\nChairman, Overseas' Students\nCommittee\nImperial College Union\nDear Editor,\nLast Saturday night the Hellenic\nSociety organised a rather unusual\nevent. Four bands namely Wild\nAngel, Arpa Cola, Gyalia Karfia\n(the Society's own band) and\nChristinas Band performed live in\nthe ICU lounge. They gave us a wide range of music from\n\"rempe tik a\"( Greek popular music\noften described as the greek blues)\nto Hard Rock. We would like to\nthank the musicians for\nparticipating, the Jazz & Rock\nsociety and Dram Soc for their kind\nsupport and the audience for\nattending. We would also like to\ntake this opportunity to thank the\nmembers of the OSC and its\npresident Andreas Mershin for\norganising the International Night.\nWe as the Hellenic Society\nparticipated in all the events (food\nfair and cultural show) and we\nbelieve that it was a very nice and\nwell coordinated team effort. We\nthus believe that the criticisms\nheard after the event (see letters to\nlast weeks felix) are unfair for the\nOSC and for the effort they put in\norganising everything despite the\nvarious problems.\nYours sincerely,\nNikos Doukas\nPublicity Officer, Hellenic\nSociety\nHarry Hatzkis\nChairman, Hellenic Society\nAs readers are encouraged to write\nto FELIX it was good to see opinions\nexpressed in the last issue. This\nweek though as everyone seems to\nbe rushing to retract and rebuff any\nand every crit is im,I just feel that it is\na pity that nobody is prepared to\nstand by their original views.\nAll this insistence that everything is\nhunk y dory in the OSC just does not\nwash considering previous\ncomments. How can either the\nchairman or executive committee\nmembers both write and say such\ndamaging things about each other\nand then suddenly be best of\nfriends? It's all too much\nLetters may be commented on by a guest editor, whose opinions are not necessarily\nthose of the editor, and cut\ndue to space restrictions. Deadline: Monday6.00 pm. In Felix 1023 Marcus Alexander\nsuggested the abolition of the\nCCUs. As active members of the\nR CSU, we would like to present\nthe other side of the argument.\nMarcus suggests that the CCUs\nare an \"outdated anachronism\".\nPerhaps we are just suckers for\nhistory, but if they were abolished, what would they be\nreplaced with? Faculties of\nScience, Engineering and Mineral\nStudies? The same idea under a shining \"new university\" name?\nRemove the power from the\nhands of the students and present\nit to the faceless administration?\nThere are, we suggest, three\nreasons why students aren't more\ninvolved with their C CU:(1) our\nunion is so good we don't have to\nfight for anything; (2) the average\nIC student's workload is too high\nto bother once he/she is in a special interest society; or (3)\nstudents don't realise they can be\ninvolved - they see their C CU as\nclique y club.\nPerhaps students aren't aware\nof the services provided by their\nC CU. It's not just sports and\nmascot ry which incidentally, is\nnot \"sad\", it's a lot of fun and a good rag fund-raise r. The CCUs\ncut IC into a less daunting size.\nEven though we are an all-science\ncollege, it would still be difficult\nfor ICU to provide the academic\nsupport given by the CC Us because of the diversity of\ncourses. CCUs enable first years\nto meet friendly 2nd and 3rd years on their course. Okay, you\ndo this anyway through any old\nclub or society, but how much time do you spend at a meeting\ndiscussing work? How else would\nyou find out what lies ahead?\nThe eternal events problem\nmentioned by Marcus is a different matter altogether -attributable to lack of money\nrather than lack of interest in\nCCUs. If a student only spends\n\u00a315 a week on food, how can\nhe/she afford \u00a345 for one night?\nGenerally the CC Us need an\ninjection of enthusiasm, and we\nbelieve the imminent arrival of St\nMary's on the IC campus will do\nthis. Mary's has been a separate\ncollege until recently, and in many ways still is. Will Mary's fall down to the current C CU apathy level? Somehow, if the\nhustings are anything to go by, we\nthink not. The minuscule\nturnout at IC hustings compared\nto Mary's show that perhaps we\nhave an Imperial College apathy\nproblem rather than aCC U one.\nConstituent College Unions\nare fundamental to the individuality of Imperial College. We,\nthe authors of this articles, do not\nsee ourselves as \"sad\" and believe\nwe have enough personality to\nstand up without any \" silly scarves\". However we are proud\nto be members of Imperial College Union and we are proud\nto belong to the Royal College of\nScience. \" Apathy\" is an overused word, but don't let it deny us\nthis unique privilege.\nHelen-Louise Windsor and\nStuart Jenkins.\n\"Generally the CCUs need\nan injection of enthusiasm\"\nThe opinions expressed in \"Cat & Mouse\" do not necessarily reflect those of FELIX or its editorial staff.\nIf you want to make a contribution, contact FELIX on x48072 or come to the office in Beit Quad.\n2\n2\nmn R9S FELIX HH\n\n"
