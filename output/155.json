Gibson\nAlmost certainly, the most exciting\nevent in London in the Operatic World\nduring the coming two or three months\nwill be the new production of Beethoven's only opera \"Fidelio\", at Covent Garden.\nThe opera will be conducted by Otto\nKlemperer and seven performances are\nscheduled between 24 th February and the\nend of the present opera season on March\n18th. Normal booking for these performances opens on January 25th. The programme for Sadler's Wells now\ncontains two works by the Czech composer\nJanecek. These are \"Katya Kabanovft\"\nand a newcomer to the 'Wells' repertory.\n\"The Cunning little Vixen\", which will\nbe given its first performance on 22nd March. One of the major problems of\npresenting works by Czech or Hungarian\ncomposers is that of translation, it being\nvery difficult to get the English version\nto fit the original vocal line. However,\nnow that \"Jenufa\", Janecek's most\npopular opera, has been more or less\naccepted into the repertory in a translated\nform, it is to be hoped that we shall hear\nmore of this composer's lesser works.\nOf more im med a it e interest is the new\nproduction of Richard Strauss' delightful\ncomic piece \"Ariadne auf Naxos\" which\nwill be first heard on January 25th. The\ncomposer's demands on the orchestra for\nthis opera are very modest, only thirty-nine players being required. But, of these\nno less than six belong to the percussion\nseo tion and another four are kept occupied\nwith the celesta, harmonium, and two\nharps.\nDiscussion on this Ballet is held over\nfor a fortnight. At the moment a large\npart of the Royal Ballet company is in\nNorth America and the company will not\nbe at full strength again until March\n2nd. l^p1961 AWARDS,\nby the President and Secretary\nof the Union.\nThe R.

This trend Is mirrored in the increasing interest in debating meets Mic, Clo's best friend, makes love\nshown lat the College this year. Atten- to Mio. O.K. so far its the code. Then\nTwo years ago I remember sitting in\nthe \"Bar Bounoparte\" just opposite St.\nGermain de Pres talking to a most charming\nliterary meme ber of the 'Green Club' about\n'\"Les Tricheurs\". It had he said been\nshot in this very spot a year ago but of\ncourse that was pass e \u2014 that was the\nleft bank two maybe three years ago. Its\nnot the same he said, they always used\nto be closing places because of the fights.\nWistfully he admitted that Paris was DO\nlonger the world centre of art, quickly\nadding like the good Frenchman he was,\nthat there was no world centre. It was\na throwback from lie resistance, the price\nof wine, the Algerian war, we raised our\npernod s, 'Vive la France' and laughed.\nNow we see 'Les Trioheurs' (the\ncheaters) in London and there we are in\nthe Bar Buonoparte just about to put a Mulligan or a Gillespie record on the juke\nbox, sur ronde d by the poor remains of\nLes Trioheurs. But at the Cinephone we\nsee these rootless rebels in all their glory,\nI raise my beer, \"La Gloire\", and laugh.\nThe cheats. Apt.

Tel.: FUL 7969.\nThe wind of change has come to the\nItalian film industry, and provoked a moral war. The stark films of Fellini, and\nAntonioni'sL 'AVVENTURA (Paris Pullman) .\nIt is an unusual film. There is no way\nof knowing whether it has succeeded or\nis a dismal failure. At the Cannes festival\nlast year it was received with derision and\nthen given a prize. The plot is dangerously\nslight, seeming to hang on a thread between meaning and chaos. Filmgoers who\nwill see this film should be more alert\nand prepared than merely open minded.\nSandro, an architect; Inna, his fiancee\nand her friend Claudia, at the invitation\nof Princess Patrizia, have joined a yacht\nparty cr using among the Lipari Islands\noff Sicily. They pause to bathe and explore a mysterious islet of volcanic rock\nrising steeply out of the sea. (Later n storm blows up and they decide to leave\nbut as they find Anna missing a Bearch\nis started.) As the savagery of the sea\nincreases the hope of most of the party\nfails. Sandro and Claudia continue the\nsea roh, separately, on the Sicilian main-land. Seperately because on that rock (it\nwas little more than that) they felt an\nattraction which they resist by avoiding\neach other. They meet on the mainland\nand together search the places where a strange girl is said to have been seen.\nThe search loses its meaning as the two become lovers. They suffer from guilt and,\nit would seem, enjoy little happiness.\nTheir endearment and caresses are the\nsame as those of Sandro and Anna. The\nwheel has now turned full circle, ready\nto be repeated.\nHad the film ended at this point, it\nwould have been a work of art, The raging\nof the sea and wind, the torment of Sandro\nand Claudia, and the byplay of the supporting characters combine to give a coordinated work of beauty. Some scenes\nwere given unnecessary prominence, Buch\nas the comp tempt of an ageing cynic for\nhis young wife, who at the villa of the\nPrincess Patrizia is seen dallying with\nthe seventeen year old son of her hostess.\nSome might insist that these scenes are\nnecessary, though I myself think not.\nUnfortunately the film goes on to spoil\nthe clear out presentation. We are taken\nto an hotel in Taormina where Sandro is\nunfaithful to Claudia. She forgives him\nin the closing scene of the film. The film\nends on a note of fantasy with Claudia\nroaming the dark, empty corridors in\nsearch of her unfaithful lover.\nThroughout the film greater effort\ncould have been made to give us the geographical location of the film. Subtitles\nwere of no help here. The acting of Monica\nVitti and Gabriele Ferzetti, and the\nscenic photography contributed to an altogether enjoyable film.\nN.K. F, BrosBnrd\nFILM\nLA DOLCE VITA\nSHOCKING REALITY\nThere is today, in the Western World,\na great distrust of \"the cause\", stemming no doubt from the disillusionment of\nthe ardent spirits of the thirties and the\nrather pessimistic, but seemingly correct\nappraisal of mankind's short comings.\nThere appears to be nothing left to rebel\nagainst; the outward condition of man\nhaving been made seo ure, he is left with\ntime to turn and examine his inner con-d it ion. From within the fastness of the\nSelf, one looks critically, subtly at the\nCause and it, poor abstraction, is trans-parent. Even belief is suspect and logic\nis lampooned as a mechanical lie on both\nsides of the channel.\nEmerging from this uncertainty and\ndesperation is that supposedly feminine\nstrength, intuition. The \"s a tori\" flies\nphoenix-like from the ashes of syllogism,\ntoo much of the sweet apple is becoming\nsickening.\nIn films this is reflected in the 'New\nWave' of Italy and the 'Nouvelle Vague',\nalso recently in 'Shadows'. The aim is to\nsuggest rather than to tell and since dogma\nis now a dirty word the artist as a mora-liz at or finds himself on the spot. He\ntherefore moralizes implicitly. He is not\namor aliz at or in the stamp of Benjamin\nFranklin but by his very comment on the\nworld around him he reacts to underline\nn failing or to point a way.\nFellini's film 'La Dolce Vita' has been\nmisunderstood because of this fact; he\nis not directly moralizing nor is he, how-ever, amoral. After blazing a trial of controversy across Europe, Fellini now brings\nhis picture of Roman cafe so oie ty to London saying that he is a party, not concerned with the church, the rich aristocracy or anything else. The scenes of mock,\norgy, cracked and broken aris to' s, parties\nare made to s ug get a whole. In themselves\nthey are simple portraits, together they\nindicate the desperation of an age. This\nis the lavish, gaudy, bla ok cloth against\nwhich the main theme is played. It is\nMarcello, a journalist for a semi-fascist\nscandal rag, by degrees losing his human-it y, his ambitions his innocence, sinking\nslowly in the mud of upper strata Rome,\nwhich has constantly to give itself new\nthrills and experiences to convince itself\nthat it is still, in fact, alive.\nMarcello wanders through this world\nvaguely against his will, seduced and se-duc ing, bored with the women who loves\nhim, his conscience occasionally reminding\nhim of the book he never writes. His\nonly rock of hope is an intellectual friend\nwho represents to him the qualities of\nmoral strength, refinement and scholar-ship. When this rock cracks, horribly, he\nis lost.\nMuch has been said of the symbols in\nthis film, but why worry too much about\nthem? It is not as though there was a prize given to the person spotting the\nmost. They are to be accepted or ignored,\nnot gloated over or scorned contempt ou sly if too obvious, besides we can all make\nmistakes.\nI was impressed, however, by Marcello's pack of snapping press photographers,\nwho seem to be emerging as a very telling\ncontemporary symbol. I was reminded of\ntheir fantastic film prototype in the\n\"Roots of Heaven\". They are depicted as\nbeing completely de-human is ed, their\nsense of engagement with their human\nprey is nil, their dedication to their profession makes them wonder if they could\nnot take a photograph of the Virgin Mary\nre-incarnated herself. They follow Marcello everywhere through a sea of fan-ta stic, interesting faces, the wonderfully\nhandled crowd scenes. The are with him\nat the death.\nThis, alas l is our world, life lived as\nn work of art. Life lived as an illusion. The\nreality is too shocking to oom pre he nd. Always the bomb and its symptomatic fears\nexpressed in despair and disbelief. \"I only believe in love \u2014 at least there is\nthe tension \u2014 long live love I\" Everything\nis a palliative, the disease, malignant,\nrots on. Nobody dare cure it, nobody can.\nIt is like the medieval syphilitic, promis-co us through fear and desperation, incur-able, in pain, an object of shame, whose\nfuture is futile and hopeless.\nRoman cafe society is not typical of\npeople generally, but it is a valid ex agger ation, emphasising for our Bake, the danger\nof losing our innocence, our humanity,\nlosing belief in our Bweet life.\nClifford Gore\n\n"

Although only a friendly match we have\nbeen trying to win for some years and we\nat last succeeded with scores of 1452-1450\nout of 1500. Quite a close result.\n%r* jr TABLE TENNIS\nHOPES FOR PROMOTION.\nIn the last week of the autumn term the\nfirst team scored notable success in beating C. E.M.I., one of the best teams in\nthe league, 8-1 to gain a place in the semifinal of the eup. The score, however,\nhardly does justice to C.E.M. who gave\nour players some very good games. Our\nrecord in the league is exceedingly good,\nand all our teams still stand a fair chance\nof promotion, though our first team have\nbad their first defeat at the hands of\nWoolwich who won 7-3.\nWith half session al exams, coming along\nI can only hope that players won't let these\ninterfere with their table tennis too much.\nIf our strength is depleted by several\nplayers over this period then this will be\na serious handicap to us when teams are\nin the running for promotion.\nRECORDS MAINTAINED ...\nI would like to draw to the the attention\nof the club the fact that the Concert Hall\nwill be available for play together with\nthe gym on Monday evenings commencing\nJanuary 23rd.I would also like to appeal\nfor support from team members during\nthis busy period.\nThe 1st and mixed teams remain un-beaten. The 1st team had an interesting\nmatch with a cosmopolitan Northern Poly,\nside before emerging the winners by 6-3.\nThe 1st team opened this term successfully with a72 win over Chelsea. The\nscore could easily have been closer, because\nour third pair, after a very shaky win over\ntheir opposite number woke, up (it was\n9.30 a.m. start) to beat the opposing 1st pair and I.C.'s thin man Sarfraz Ahmad,\nthought it was a friendly match until he\nhad played the first game.\nBOXING\nU.L.

C.1st XI had a good victory in\ntheir last league match of the Autumn\nterm. Playing away against a much-im-proved Battersea side they won 5-5. This\nwin took the 1st XI to the top of the\nPremier Division of the University league.\nOn the same day the 2nd XI played U.C. in the Cup. This was the third time the\ntwo sides had met in the competition, and\nthe result was yet another draw (3-3). The\n3rd XI had a close league match with Kings\n2nd XI at Harlington. The result was a32 win for I.C. The I.C.4 th XI was also\nengaged in a league fixture. The match\nwas against Battersea 2nd XI at Harlington and the home side ran out 3-2 win-ner s. The I.C.5 th XI, playing well, had\na convincing 6-1 win against Birkbeek n, while the I.C. VI, also playing in a league\nmatch drew 2-2 with Batttersea HI.\nThe only match on 14th December was\na1 st XI friendly match against Reading\nUniversity at Harlngton. Although the I.C. team was drawing 3-3 at one stage, the\nUniversity proved too strong for the home\nside and added four further goals to their\nscore. The final result was thus 7-4 to\nReading.\nOn the first Wednesday of term Mines\nplayed the R.C.S. in the Technology Cup.\nFor most of the match Mines played the\nbetter football, and were unfortunate to\nonly draw, 2-2. The I.C.7 th XI playing\nthe School of Pharmacy lost in a high-scoring match. The result was 9-5.\nOn Saturday 14th the I. C.1st XI consolidated their position at the top of the\nPremier Division by defeating Chelsea College 3-1. The I.C. scorers were Olding,\nCodling and Mousse-Jones. The 2nd XI\nput up a dismal performance aga is t King's III in an away match; th ie result was a50 win to King's. The 5th XI although\ndown 5-2 at one stage, rallied well to win\n6-5 in an exciting league match against\nChelsea U.

Beoause of the great response of\nthe fresher s at the eo mme neeme rt of the\nseason and due to their continued support\nwith the 'old faithfuls' the eight teams have\nconsistently taken the field each Saturday.\nOn occasions the enthusiastic support has\nbeen somewhat em barra sing to Club officials: too many Club players have been\nforced to play well below their standard,\nwith the result that the lower teams in\nthe Club had by far the most successful\nfirst term. Messrs. Turner, Liberman and\nBlakeley have endeavour ed to strengthen\nthe fixture lists for these lower teams so\nthat much tougher and we hope more enjoyable games will result for them.\nDave Hockin's Wanderers have had a particularly brief but powerful life. Perhaps their most worthy victory was a30 win over a strong and experienced Old\nPauline's side. The three 'B' teams have\nthe best records in the Club, each having\nonly lost one game last term. Jim Carters\n'Old Boys' for some 'un-natural' reason\nnarrowly lost the first game of the season\nto Rosslyn Park side, after which they have\nwon handsomely ea oh week, the most\nnotable being a33 pts. win over a Borderer's team during the vacation. Chris\nHead's team also fell victoriously to a Rosslyn Park team and have likewise\ntriumphed ever since. John Lyndon's team, the most 'sociably' minded of the\nChib gave of their best on Dec. 10th to\nlower and trample on a King's team by\n48 pts. to 0.\nOf the four higher teams Dave Thompson's Ex.

THE CARNIVAL EDICT At the first Union Meeting of this session there was a considerable and interested discussion on the charity to which the\nproceeds of this year's l.C. Carnival were\nto be given. The Chairman of the Carnival\nCommittee asked for helpers to coma\nforward, and, for the whole affair, there\nseemed to be a welcome enthusiasm.\nIt is now January, and the work ol\nthe Carnival Committee is being hindered\nby the fact that not enough people are\ncoming forward and offering their services.\nEverybody realises that the average\nstudent is kept hard pressed by the demands of the academic work, but I doubt\nif there are any who are so overpowered\nthat they have no leisure and not even\none or two hours per week during which\nthey could be doing valuable work for the\nl.C. Carnival.\nRemember this is OUR Carnival I It is\nthe one occasion that we have to remind\nthe people in Kensington and Westminster\nthat OUR noise, energy and vivacity can\nbe put to good uses. It is only by the\neffort of the student body as a whole that\nWE can succeed.\nI would ask you all to look over your\nactivities for the succeeding weeks of this\nterm and whether you could not spend a little time helping our already overworked\nCarnival Committee.\nIan.

After this\noutburst of poly-dire ot ional is m or what\nmight be called going around in circles,\nwe rapidly come to the conclusion that\nmost of our tentative plans were exactly\nas we expected \u2014 still tentative. We\nthen, after declaring the situation a state\nof emergency, dialled 999 only to learn\nthat this was one emergency they could\nnot handle. Not to be disappointed we\ncontinued to run around in circles, which\nwas not en th s ya bad thing as we met\nmore people who eventually combined to\nform the present oom mitte e. The committee now, following a metamorphose of\nmono-directional is m, can report with more\noe rta in ty the plans of the Second Annual\nCharity Carnival.\nThe Carnival Week will commence\nMonday, May 8th, and terminate Saturday, May 13th at the fe te in Princes Gardens. During the week there will be appropriate publicity stunts, a domino mara-thon, and a hop. Friday night is absolutely\nTL must in your plans as it is the Carnival\nFancy Dress Ball, with 2 orchestras,\ndancing in the quad., an excellent buffet,\nsome challenging displays (What's on\nyour partner's mind, and a Kiss-o meter),\nand the gala crowning of the Carnival\nQueen.

The cost of printing an eight page FELIX by the method\nused before, that is the \"offset\" process,\nwas about \u00a318.\nYou, our readers, contributed regularly\nabout \u00a315 towards this; the remaining \u00a33\nor go being made up from the Union\nfunds.\nThe paper which you are reading now\nhas cost \u00a328 to print, and only four pages\nat that l This leaves a deficit of \u00a313. It\nis hoped that most of this will be regained\nin future by selling advertising space at\nthe rates shown elsewhere, but for the time\nbeing this extra cost is being borne by the\nUnion. Like all business ventures we need\na certain amount of capital to start the\nball rolling. Should our financial turnover\nfrom advertising reach higher proportions\nthen we can go ahead and print larger\neo pies of FELIX, but for the present we\nshall have to be o on tent with these four\npages.\nFELIX ADVERTISING RATES.\nQUARTER PAGE 5 GUINEAS\nEither: two columns wide by half a high.\nor: four columns wide by quarter column\n' high.\nONE EIGHTH PAGE 3 GUINEAS\nEither: two columns wide by quarter\ncolumn high.\nor: one column wide by half column\nhigh.\nONE SIXTEENTH PAGE 30 8h.

Although I am\na fresher it is already clear to me that\noutsiders tend to look upon us as a group\nwishing to segregate themselves from the\nrest of London University. Such terms as\nthe \"University of Kensington\" have come\nto my ears and I feel there is a certain\namount of truth in such talk. This view\nis further endorsed by the fact that with\nall the multitude of Union activities which\nhave already occured, no mention of these\nhas been made (to my knol edge at least)\nin either 'Sennet' or the student edition\nof the 'Evening Standard' during this\nsession. It seems to me that the only\npeople who know anything about us, are\nsome of ourselves. If, as I believe a large\nbody are, we are so set against any form\nof racial segregation, how can we tolerate\nany such parallel slate of affairs amongst\nLondon University students? However,\nwould anybody who disagrees with this\npoint of view please comment in a future\nedition of FELIX as I am sure that my\nexperience of outside opinion about IC is\nlimited.\nDear Sir,\nJeffrey Turner\nAs you and some of your readers know,\nthe I.C. Cross Country Club is intending\nto make an attempt on the Land's End to\nJohn o 'Groats Relay record ( at present held\nby Cambridge University1\n- during the next\nEaster va o ation, from the 8th to 16th April, inclusive.

Physios)\nby Dan Elwyn Jones.\nSo great is desperate need in the\nWorld, so vast the numerical reality\nof starvation, sickness, and misery\namongst the homeless and disposes s ed, amongst the tragic victims of war,\ndisaster and famine that it is easy\nto forget the shattered remnants of\nindividual human lives that are accounted for in the reports and sta-tis tics. It is easy to feel helpless\nabout the horror that was the wake\nof the earthquakes in Chile and\nAgadir and the Pakistan hurricane. It\nis easy lo feel helpless in the knowledge that, des pio e all we did for\nWorld Refugee Year, the needs of\nrefugees in North A'frica, the Middle\nEast and Hong Kong become as acute\nthis winter as they have been during the pns t decade.\nAs you read this article, 250,000\nstarving Baluba tribesmen, homeless,\nand without means of support, are\nfleeing tih rough the forests of the\nCongo from the slaughter of their\ntribe in the Kasai province. Scattered along the roads are children\nwith arms and legs no thicker than a man's thumb, walking skeletons, and\nmen and women with bodies swollen\nand bloated by hunger oedema. Over\nChristmas hundreds of them died of\nexposure and hunger, and unless\nmassive help is forthcoming muni\nmore will perish.\nAs you read th'S article hundreds\nof Arab refugees shiver in mountain\ncaves, reed and mud huts, in black\ntro at skin tents in the inhospitable\nwastes along the borders of Morocco\nand Tunisia.

COMMENT.\nby John Cox\nI have often been asked why I am ya\npassionately attached to such ideas as I.C, joining N.U. S.,I.C. W.A. being allowed in\nthe I.C. bar, Council's decisions being made\npublic to the Union, more Union meet-in gs, etc. In this article I will attempt to\nanswer the question, \"What's wrong with\nI.C?\"A University Education should include\nnot only a degree, balanced of course by\nappropriate physical exercise in at least\none spor^'. It should pio vi de opportunity\nfor every student to broaden his ou lt ural and soo io logical knowledge and outlook.\nFew people dispute that in this re pec tI.C. fails abyss m ally. Few people are agreed on\nwhy this is so, fewer still on the cure.\nMy cure is not a panacea. It o on s is ts primarily of supporting every move to\nincrease democracy in the Union. This\nmeans:\n1. The Union members should know\nmore about Union affairs, student affairs,\nlocal and national.\n2. There should be more members of the\nUnion able to take part in the taking of\ndecisions.\nThe effect of more democracy would be:\n1. To broaden the experience and knowledge of students at I.C. and to increase\nthe participation in the Union affairs by\nordinary members.\n2. To increase the confidence of members of the Union in their ability. An illustration of this point is the fact that at\nI.C. most students laugh at the idea that\nthey could be responsible for the management of the Refectory. Many1\no an not believe that at other Colleges the Students'\nUnion has been responsible for the suo eBS ful running of their refectory for years.\n\"We couldn't know enough\", they chorus.\n\"Fotheringham\" has consistently fallen\ninto the error of believing that I am prim-a rly concerned with airing my views on\nvarious subjects in these COMMENTS.\nNaturally I would like people to agree\nwith my view, but my primary concern\nhas been to ensure that the subjects get\naired. \"Fotheringham\", I have no doubt,\nwill object to the installation of a Mechanical Cow in the Snack Bar without consultation with the Studens' Union. But\nwill he dare suggest that the Students'\nUnion should be in control of all decisions\na ffe o ting the Refectory?\n\"Fotneringham\" will object like myself\nto the drunken orgy of last term which\nculminated in a fresher's head being\nbanged against a concrete floor with not\nvery pleasant results. But will he consider\nto what extent we are responsible for the\nfact that the leaders of our Union are\noften chosen for their qualities when\ndrunk?\nWhat is wrong with I.C. is that it is\nessentially nothing more than a glorified\npolytechnic With a more democratic setup the atmosphere might become more\nadult and the next generation might leave\nwith a real University education.\nCOUNTER COMMENT.\nby R.T.L. Fotheringham\nAs this is the beginning of a new term\n1 s hal try to reply to Mr. Cox's Exposition\nof the Gospel of Democracy as politely as\npossible. Mr Cox makes two basic statements in his article:\n1. Students at I.C. do not obtain a University education.\n2. By instituting democratic government these students would obtain said\neducation.\nI agree completely with the first state-ment, but feel that the fault lies almost\nentirely with the individual student. I disagree equally completely with the idea\nthat by allowing the students as a whole\nto make every decision concerned with the\nrunning of the Union we would a chive 'confident, experienced and knowledgeable\nstudents.' The result in practice would be\nchaos.\nThe basic premise of the democratic\nideal is that the electorate must be educated and must know the fa ots necessary\nto arrive at a correct decision. The present\nsystem of control at I.C. is a resonable\napproximation to this. Important matters\nof policy, such as N.U.S.a if lili at don, method of Presidential election, are dealt\nwith at full Union Meetings. The day-to-day running of the Union is dealt with by\nvarious committees responsible to Council.\nThe people on these committees have\ntime to give full consideration to the matters within their jurisdiction; very few\nstudents could afford sufi cie nt time to\ndeal with all the activities of the I.C. Union. If the individual student wishes\nto partake in the running of the Union\nI am sure Mr. Cox will explain to him\nhow easy it is to get on to various com-mitte es. The general lack of interest is\nsuch that very few posts are contested.\nMr. Cox seems to be very muddled in\nhis ideas about the Refectory. The Refectory (and indeed the Union) is owned\nby the College Governors. While the Governors allow us to administrate the Union\nto our own ends they do not allow us\nsimilar control over the Refectory. The Refectory Club (see Blue Book) is run Ly\nthe Governors, who allow us seven representatives on the Refeotory Oommittee.\nThis same Refectory Committee sanctioned\nthe installation of the 'Meohanioal Cow',\nand last year's President (Mr. Allen) who\nsat on the Refeotory Committee, apparently did not think the matter important\nenough to call to the attention of a Union\nMeeting.\nSQUARE DANCING\nOBSCENE?\nCertainly not l Nobody could call Square\nDaneing obscene. Anybody o an do it\nif you sign the notice on the Council\nNotice Board in the Union Lounge.\nThe Downward Trend\nAbandoning their normal winter haunts\nin the Glencoe district, thirteen members\nof the Mountaineering Club sallied north\nto the Cairngorms in search of good snow\nand plenty of ice.\nVarious members, apparently obsessed\nwith a desire for pub lio it y, indulged in\nfrivolous activities which are frowned upon\nby nearly all the best text books on mount-a in ee ring; indeed, in terms of the 'meet\nactivity ratio' (The total number of incidents divided by the duration of the meet\nin minutes), this meet was the most\neventful the o lub has held for some time.\nIn this respect, two members gave the\nmeet a flying start by in advert ant ly losing themselves in a blizzard on the first\nday out; after describing a depressingly\nlarge circle on the Cairngorm landscape,\nthey returned to the hostel early the following morning; needless to say they woke\neveryone up \u2014 no light footed fairies, these\nboys \u2014 but everyone was too relieved at\nseeing them again to curse them.\nAfter a day spent avoiding the press\nwe managed to return to the serious buisness of climbing, wh i oh, after all, is what\nwe went for. The main climbing activities\nwere confined to two impressive corrie s below Cairn Gorm and Cairn Lochan,\nnamely Coire Sneachda and Coire Lochan.\nThe superb line of cliffs on the northern\nside of the Lairg Gru were full of possibilities but the only excursion made to the\n.spot was spoiled by foul weather.\nThe cliffs in Cloire Sneachda were the\nfirst to receive our attention; gullies were\nnormally the lines of weakness chosen for\nascent since elsewhere the snow was present in neither sufficient quantity or quality\nto be usu able. Nevertheless, some fine, exposed routes were made on the bulky central\nc ll if s, with a good deal of step-cutting on\nice, though not as much we hoped for.\nIn Coire Lochan, despite rival at-traction s, interest o entre d mainly on\nthe \"vent\" a600 feet e ull v with\na bulging, snow-and-ice-covered c bock stone forming the first crux. After\ncopious quantities of unstable snow had\nbeen disposed of, the chock Bt one was surmounted by combined tao tics( little man\nstands on big man's shoulders), until the\nlittle man in question peeled off the ice\nslope) above, sailed gracefully over the\no hook stone and hit the President smartly\niti the back. Thus aroused, the President\nsmartly sub mounted the c hook stone with\nsingular alacrity and made considerable\nprogress above it until, in a sudden\nburst of prudence (quite uncharacteristic),\nhe declared prog reB S 'unjustifiable' and reversed the pit oh ingeniously and inelegantly. By now the downward trend was in and\ntwo members achieved notoriety by breaking all club records for accidental, unc on trolled, glis sades. Two further members\nindulged in similarly uncontrollable downward progress by defecting the ranks\nof the skiers-crass social climbers, the\npairs of them; they will be dealt\nwith accordingly.\nSoon after this the tempo of the meet\ndropped; alarmed at the thought of having\nto cover a term's work in a oo up le of days,\neveryone began to drift home. Perhaps it\nwas just as well, the downward trend might\nhave developed into an avalanche.\nFOR SALE\nCAR CAR CAR\nBLUE Morgan 4/4 series 1, 1937, with\nupholstery, in parts or hole, o has s is only\nslightly bent: rear axle appears to be\ncracked.
