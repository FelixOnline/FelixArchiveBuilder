    "content": "2 FELIX 14th May, 1974\nLETTERS\nU.G. M.'s& Free Speech\nfrom T. Phillips\nSir\nI am writing regarding\nthe U GM of May 2nd. It may be as well to\nclear up some misconceptions which have\narisen, and to make a few comments on the\nconduct of the meeting.\nThis can be done by outlining the proceedings\nchronologically.\nAt 2.13 p.m. the ballot\nfor the floor reps was\ncompleted. At this point\nMr. Lolley called the\nquorum several times.\nThose who remained at\nthe meeting, including\nmyself, wanted to see\nthe next item on the\nagenda discussed; how-ever, certainly expected\nthe meeting to be clos-ed, as indicated in the\nUnion's Standing Orders. I was surprised that\nMr. Wadsworth ignored\nthe challenge; when it\nwas pointed out to him\nthat he must observe the\nstanding orders and\nclose the meeting which\nwas clearly in quo rate, he\nsaid \"I do not hear the\nchallenge\".\nMr. Lolley began to\nuse aloud haile r to call\nquorum.\n2.14 Mr. Sayles, in the\nchair, called for a proposer to the motion in\nquestion. Mr. Lynch\nrose, and said approximately three sentences.\nMr. Sayles also ignored Mr. Lolley's chal-leng e.2.15 Mr. Sayles called\nfor a speaker to move\nthe amendment. I rose\nand proceeded to the\nmicrophone. Before I began to speak, Mr. Bartley moved standing order 20 i), \"that the question now be put\". Constitutionally Mr. Sayles\nwas not bound to accept\nthis.\nHe did, however, and\nwith Mr. Lolley still calling quorum, asked for a vote. It was not clear\nwhether Mr. Bartley\nwished the amendment\nor the original motion to\nbe voted upon. While\nthis was being cleared\nup, Mr. Lolley gave up\nin disgust, and Mr. East\ntook over from him. Mr.\nEast prevailed where Mr.\nLolley had not and the\nmeeting was closed.\nTwo issues arise here.\nFirstly both chairmen\nblatantly ignored the\nstanding orders in not\nclosing the meeting. Is it\nany wonder that a candidate in the recent IC\nelection called for a more rigid application of\nstanding orders.\nSecondly, this lapse\ncould hardly have been\nmade in the interest of\nthe discussion. Otherwise, why did Mr. Sayles accept a procedural\nmotion, which effectively would have meant no\ndebate?\nAs I understand it,\nMr. Bartley wanted to\nvote on the original motion immediately, and\nnot debate or vote on the\namendment. Clearly, at\n2.15, he could not have\nbeen worried about the\ntime factor.\nI would suggest that\nsince Mr. Bartley was\nopposed to my position\non the issue, he attempted to prevent me from\nputting forward my point\nof view. To quote a prominent member of\nthe Union \"Maybe he\ndidn't want to hear what\nyou wanted to say\". Mr.\nBartley himself claimed\nthat the situation was\nquite clear: \"the social-is ts\"( whoever they are)\nwere trying to stop\npeople they didn't like\nfrom speaking. Therefore, he claimed, there\nwas no reason for me to\nsay anything.\nWho, I ask, is trying\nto stop free speech?\nTrev Phillips, Chem 3.\nfrom D.M. Brown\nand P.R. Lynch\nSir,\nWe feel we must protest about some of the\noccurrences at the last\nUnion Meeting. Trev\nPhillips' amendment to\nthe 'Free Speech' motion\nremoved sanctions all\ndealing with this topic turning it into a motion on racial is m and attempting to prevent discussion of the original\nissue. Further, Mr. Phillips' suggestion that the\nPresident-elect (who, coincidentally is also called Trev Phillips) produces his own personal\nreport to the Union is\nunthinkable: Why should\nhe become a one-man\nracial is m committee?\nOne man does not make\na discussion?\nIn short, Mr. Phillips\nshould propose his own\nracial is m motion, not\namend someone else's on a totally different\ntopic.\nHowever, this is not\njust a piece of idle Trevbashing. Trev stood for\nelection under a free\ndemocratic system: everyone had their say, noone was suppressed, and\nTrev got elected (news!\nnews!).\nIf he has been elected\nunder this system, he\nis under a moral obligation to abide by it, or he\nbecomes a dishonest incredible candidate. If it.\nwas his intention to support the suppression of\nfreedom of speech, he\nshould have stated so in\nhis campaign.\nThe system has been\nabused. The only way for\npeople to remove these\nabuses is for more\npeople to attend Union\nMeetings. Democracy\nonly works when t arge numbers of people are\ninterested. If more\npeople attended Union\nmeetings, there would be\nno more quorum challenges and democracy\nwould be preserved.\nA Union Meeting is\nmeant to.be representative of the Union, and as\nsuch can never be representative with a small\nnumber of people pre s ent, or if one half of the\nUnion is actively sup-pressed.\nD.M. BROWN\nP.R. LYNCH\n(Publicity Department,\nI.C. Conservative Society)\nfrom J. East\nSir,\nAs a result of the\ncriticism I have rec eiv ed, I will explain why I called 'quorum' at the\nlast Union Meeting.\nA motion which would\ndecide whether Racists\nand Fascists would be\nable to peddle their reactionary theories was\nbeing debated, those\nwho said they should\nhad spoken and Mr. Phillips stood up to propose\nan amendment. At this,\nsomeone suggested we\nvote on the motion then.\nThe chairman accepted\nthis proposal (which he\nneed not do) and therefore we were deciding\non this most important\nissue without even hearing why Racists and Fascists should have 'no\nplatform in the colleges.\nIs this the democracy\nConservative Society\nand the Executive want?\nJI trust Mr. Phillips will\ndeal with some of the\nother points, I would like\nto explain why we say\n\"No platform for Racists\nand Fascists\".\nj We have heard of the\n'scientific' theories of\nsuch as Eisiinle and Huntington, who maintain\nthat Anglo-Saxons are\nthe master-race (even\nScots, Welsh and Irish\nare inferior) but what of\ngroups such as the Fascist National Front, who\nhave harrassed im mi grants, under the guise\nof looking for 'illegal'\nones. The law has given\nthem a licence to spread\ntheir racist propaganda,\nand they seem to be immune from the Race-Relations act. It is only by\ndenying them a platform,\nthat the spread of their\ntheories can be halted,\nalong with an explanation of the dangers of\nracism ot those who racists are trying to influence. We do not need\nracists to explain the\ndanger of racism, therefore there is no need to\nlet them 'condemn'\nthemselves.\nThe racist propaganda\nhas already been put to\ngood use among the\nworking class, where\nWhite trade unionists\nhave on occasion 'scab-bed' on black fellow\nworkers, and in the colleges where, for in-stance, we have the overseas students committee\nat IC proposing that all\nforeigners take a course\nin English at their own\nexpense before being admitted (this from a committee which is meant\nto help overseas stud-ents). Similarly the proposal to increase fees\nfor overseas students to\n\u00a31500, is being used by\nracists, who say it is a privilege for 'wo gs' to\nstudy here,\nI hope all students at\nIC will welcome as I do,\nthe news that the ViceChairman of that racist\nrabble, the Monday Club,\nwas stopped from speaking in Oxford last week,\nand condemns the fact\nthat Consoc have invited\nhim here.\nWe should take note\nof the people of the East\nEnd of London who in\n1930 refused Mosely a platform, when he tried\nteo march with his fac is t bands through Cable\nStreet. 25,000 people\nstopped them. But these\nevents are not all in the\npast, the NF have marched through Britain with\ntheir racist filth, and\nregularly stand in elections. WE MUST REALISE THAT FREE\nSPEECH WONT STOP\nTHEM. BAR STAFF\nWAGES\nfrom T. Francis\nDear Sir,\nI would like to draw\nyour attention to the way\nthis college treats its\npart-time bar staff.\nThe rate of pay is 48p an hour and has been\nfor two years and on the\ngrounds of inflation\nalone, an increase is in\norder. For a session in\nSouthside or the Union\nthis means \u00a32.40 (plus\na meal), for an evening\nshift. Although this is\nmore than some pubs\npay, pub barmen merely\nserve; they do not do\ncellar work, glass collecting and washing,\nbottling up and the other\nmany tasks college part-timers do as a matter of\ncourse.\nThere are many occasions when the bars are\nopen outside normal\nhours. This is especially\ntrue in College Block\nBar, which has been open until 4 a.m. on occasions. After the bar does\neventually shut it takes\nabout two hours to clear\nup the mess. This means\npart-timers may work until 6 a.m. The system, as\nit stands at the moment,\ndoes not pay any form\nof overtime, so one can\nwork fourteen hours\nstraight at 48p per hour.\nIt is also a fact that the\nonly way of getting\nhome after 1 a.m. is effectively by taxi. Taxi\nfares are not reimbursed,\nso a couple of hours pay\nare lost just getting\nhome. Exploitation of\ncheap student labour?\nIt may be stated by\nthe authorities that the\nbar cannot afford to pay\na fairer wage. This is not\nthe case; the bars always\nmake a considerable pro-fit, thousands of pounds\na year\u2014note the recent\nvast modernisation of\nbar facilities.\nI wrote this letter because I feel the system\nto be unjust. I am quite\nprepared to argue the\ncase with anyone (who\nbuys me a pint!)\nFinally, I was glad to\nhear the Rector has set\nup a working party to examine how the college\ncan get more benefit\nfrom outside people using the facilities here.\nYours faithfully\nT. Francis\nReply from D. Sinclair\nSir,\nThank-you for allowing me to comment on\nthis letter. I have discussed the matter, briefly,\nwith Mr. Mooney and he\nwill write to your correspondent in due course. I can assure you that this\nmatter will be brought\nbefore the Bar Committee, of which the President of the Union, Mr.\nNorman Sayles, is a member and the Deputy\nPresident is Chairman. I cannot give a complete\nanswer until after that\nmeeting to which, incidentally, barmen have\nbeen invited.\n\u2022\u2022'\u2022\u2022i \u00abr xsl u oy gi\nI would, however,\npoint out at this early\nstage that, as your correspondent states, we do\npay a better rate than\nlocal pubs for our casual\nlabour. I would also\npoint out that the bars\nare run for students to\ndrink in and, not, in the\nfirst analysis, to provide\nthem with a means of\nsupplementing their in-come, although many\nstudents take advantage\nof this opportunity and I feel this is probably to\nthe benefit of most\npeople who drink in IC\nbars. As regards working overtime, this is a matter of negotiation between the barman and\nthe casual barman. The\nnormal practice is for a barman to ask someone\nif he would care to work\non a specified bar on a specified night for a specified wage. If the\ncasual barman does not\nthink it's worth his while\nhe refuses. Obviously,\nlate night extension bars\ne.g. for College Block\ndinners, are better suited\nto people who live fin\nHall or near to College.\nIf you must get, and pay\nthrough the nose for,* a taxi home in the early\nhours, after working all\nevening, you must judge\nwhether, all things con-side red, it's worth it.\nI would say again that\nthis is a personal opinion\nand I have not had time\nto consult the relevant\ncommittee but this will\nbe done.\nYours sincerely,\nD. Sinclair.\nNUS/\nNEW STATESMAN\nSTUDENT\nJOURNALIST\nCOMPETITION\nTwo students from\nStirling University have\nwon two of the three\nawards in the Student\nJournalist Competition,\njointly sponsored by the\nNational Union of Students and the New Statesman.\nThe competition,\nwhich attracted 170 en-tries, was open to all\nmembers of the NUS at\nUniversities and colleges\nin the UK and to sixth-former s and to students\nabroad.

    "content": "6 FELIX14 th May, 1974\nREVIEWS\nBOOKS\nPROTECTION\nOF THE\nENVIRONMENT\nOn May 3rd, PAN/Ballantine, in\nassociation with Friends of the Earth\npublished a revised and up-dated\nedition of Jonathan Holliman's\" CONSUMER'S GUIDE TO THE\nPROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT (50p). In this he aims to look\nat several major areas of goods and\nservices and explains, simply and\nclearly, the environmental costs of\ntheir production, use and disposal.\nMost people must be aware by\nnow that the interest in our environment1 and the protection of the\nEarth's limited resources has risen\ngreatly. This was amply shown with\nthe oil crisis at the turn of the year.\nThis year has also seen an increase\nin the number of organisations that\nare prepared to \"re-cycle\" goods for\nre-use. At college we now re-cycle\ncomputer paper, several corporation\ncleansing departments are collecting glass and paper separately.\nAnother way in which it is possible\nMEDICINE\nHEAD\nThru' A Five\nThis is the first album from the\ngroup since it enlarged from a duo\nto a quintet, last October. The addition of former Family drummer Rob\nTownsend, ex Freedom Star Roger\nSaunders (guitars and keyboards),\nand West Indian George Ford (bass\nguitars), has done a lot to broaden\nthe so j nd of the group and widen\nthe total textures of their music. I also feel that their addition has given\nthe group more freedom of expression\u2014particularly in the vocals. The\nrhythm section of the band has obviously been strengthened, but the\nn sw members of the band don't seem to have stimulated many new\nideas here. The rhythm on all but\ntour of the tracks is, to all intents\nand purposes, the same as that used\non \"One and One is One\". On the\nBURT ALCANTARA\nZygoat\nThis album, second in a series of\n6, is purely electronic, composed by\nBurt Alcantara, it uses ARP and R SE Synthesizers. \"ZYGOAT\" however,\nis rr cM'eC'ion of electronic\nsounding violins, woodwinds, voices\n. . . On this album, the synthesizers\nare used to produce sounds only a synthesizer could produce.\nBurt Alcantara is a32 year old\nNew Yorker. He studied clarinet, sax\nand, piano at an early age, later\nmoved to conga and timpani and was\nadmitted to the Julliard Academy\nwhere he studied from 1959-64. He\nhas worked with the American Balto save on our resources is to cut\ndown on the rate at which we use\nthem. The main aim of the book is\nto show the numerous ways that are\navailable for doing this.\n\"Use cloth napkins, hand towels,\nhandkerchiefs and nappies instead\nof throw-away paper ones . . .\"\nHe heavily slams several parts of\nour society today. The advertising\nindustry for \"Deceiving customers as\nto the real merits of a product. . .\",\n\"The family that willingly has a large\nnumber of children . . .\".\nThe book is full of very fine sentiments indeed but what chance is\nthere of them being widely acc ep ted. How many of the Ordinary working class people, who make up the\nmajority of any population, are going\nto read this book and therefore know\nwhat resources they are wasting?\nUnfortunately it needs massive campaigns to try and put over, these\nideas, but the easiest way to finance\nthis would be through industry, and\nit is not likely that industry is going\nto encourage the consumer to buy\nless of its products.\nThe book is well written and\nmakes very interesting reading. However, words are not what is wanted.\nother tracks the group don't seem\nto have achieved any new positive\nidentity and direction in their music.\nWhilst the album is pleasant there\nare few exceptional moments. Disregarding the singles the best tracks\nfor me were \"Changin' Man\",\n\"Rain\", and \"Indian Queen\". These\ndidn't resort to the \"One and One\"\nrhythm and showed a lot of imagination and a lot of promise for the\nfuture.\nI feel that whilst there are some\ngood individual performances on the\nalbum, the album fails to succeed\nbecause the group haven't been together long enough. Perhaps they\nwill be fully integrated when they record the next album. To sum up, this\nis an album which retains some of\nthe old Medicine Head whilst\nbranching out in new directions. The\ngeneral direction of the band\nthough, isn't evident. Although the\nalbum shows a lot of promise for the\nfuture there's nothing really outstanding about it\u2014is just remains a nice average album.\nC. Dewey.\nlet Theatre, Paul Mauriat, the Nederlands Dans Theatre and the Ballet\nRambert.\nThe first thing that strikes with this\nalbum is the cover. An impression of\na small ruined village, overseen by\nan upright, human faced goat, a fabulous palace in the background\nand a foetus hovering above. The\nalbum itself is rather more difficult\nto describe. It is a fine album, and\nalthough Burt Alcantara doesn't try\nto imitate other instruments directly\nhe doesn't reach the other extreme\nand produce a lot of. noise with no\nmusical content. Most of the album\ncontains gentle sounds with a steady rhythm, although there are\ntimes when he produces a much\nharsher feeling.\nTo me, this is how synthesizers\nshould be used.\nHITCH-HIKERS\nGUIDE TO\nEUROPE\nSome time ago i was lucky enough\nto be able to spend some time on\nthe continent, hitch-hiking. This can\nespecially be fun when, like me, you\nspeak only English and not even the\nrudiments of a foreign language.\nHowever, on that tour, I was able\nto get an immense amount of help,\nfacts and information from a paperback \"HITCH-HIKER'S GUIDE TO\nEUROPE\" by Ken Walsh. This has\nrecently been produced in a4 th revised edition for 1974.\nThe layout of the book is very\neasy to follow. The first part is taken\nup with general hints on hitching\nand basic survival:\n\" A friend of mine once got an\nattack (of diarrhoea) in Algeria.\nHe was in the middle of nowhere\n. . . . had no paper except a book\nhe hadn't read. He tells of sitting\non the side of the road, frantically\nreading page after page so he'd have a back-log of paper to see\nhim through his next attack\".\nThe majority of the remainder is\nsplit into chapters on different counter ies ranging from Ireland to Iran\nand Norway to Tunisia with all the\nREFUGEE\nRefugee\nPatrick Moraz is someone you'll\nbe hearing a lot more of in the years\nto come. For he's a Swiss key-boards/synthesis er player, stroke\ncomposer, who sets Refugee's debut\nalbum alight with his artistic and\nhighly im magi native display of keyboard virtuosity. He might not have\nthe road experience of Emerson and\nWakeman, but he's made up for that\nwith a complete mastery of the keyboard instruments. He's no mean\ncomposer either, and his Swiss influence on the band's material brings\na delightful and refreshing new\nsound to the rock industry. Whilst I immensely enjoy their shorter tracks\n(Papillion, Someday and Ritt Mickley) their more ambitious tracks\nwhich are neo-classical in nature,\ncontain a great depth of feeling, in\nFOCUS Hamburger\nConcerto\nWriting record reviews at gone\n5.00 a.m., after just having seen the\ndawn is quite an experience. However, to get down to business. Focus,\nHolland's top band, and one of\nEurope's best have u der gone several line-up changes recently. Their\nlatest album \"HAMBURGER CONCERTO\" still has Thijs Van Leer\n(keyboards (9 of) flutes, voices and\nwhistling) and Jan Akkerman (gui-tars, lute, handclaps) as the remaining members of the original. In\naddition there is Bert Ruiter (bass\nand various other instruments) who\nfirst appeared on Focus 3, and Colin\nAllen, a new English addition\n(drums and percussion).\nThe title track (or work) takes\ncountries in between (i.e. Europe, N. Africa, and the Middle East) and the\nEastern Bloc countries. The largest\nsections are devoted, as you might\nexpect, to the main European countries (France, Germany, Italy etc.).\nThere is information on the best entrances and exits from the countries,\nsomething that can be especially\nuseful if you're planning to pass\nstraight through as fast as possible\nto reach your destination. The capital of each country is listed with details as to the cheapest places to\nstay and the sights to see. There is\nalso a \"tourist's\" guide to the beauty\nspots and-works of wonder.\nThe remainder is full of different\nregulations for working and work\npermits, a very brief language and\ncurrency guide, and tips and comments from readers.\nWithout this book it would still be\npossible to do the trip, but in a much\nmore disorganised and unsatisfactory manner. There were times when\nthe information it contains was invaluable and I personally would not\nbe without it whilst hitching on the\ncontinent.\nCopies are available from the college bookshop at only 50p each. It is\nregarded by some as the hitch er's \"bible\". I'd just say that it was the\nthird most important thing I took\nwith me, the others being my passport and my money (and I saved a lot of the latter using the book).\nPAW.\nfact much more feeling than the\nmore recent Yes albums. All the\nsame Refugee aren't out to copy\nYes, EL P or Pink Floyd, even though\nthere are slight similarities. Their\nsound does, though, remind me of\nthe old Nice sound. But that's not\nsurprising since the three-man band\ncontains ex-Nice members, Lee\nJackson and Brian Davison.\nFor a debut album it's extremely\ngood, and if Refugee continue as\nthey have started Keith Emerson will\nsoon be kicking himself for having\nleft. My only one criticism is perhaps\nwith the longer tracks (Great Canyon Suite and Credo). At times I found my attention beginning to\nwander; but there again Refugee\nhave only been together for a matter\nof months, and in that short time you\ndon't expect the band to achieve the\ndegree of co-ordination that EL P and Yes have. To sum up, a great\ndebut album from Refugee who, if\nthey go on like this, should soon be\namong the ELP's, the Yes's and the\nPink Floyds\u2014if not above them.\nClive Dewey.\nup all of the second side and is (with\nthe exception of a few yodels and\nsome short foreign lyrics (dutch?))\ninstrumental. Although there are six\nnamed tracks within this work, and\neach can actually be picked out on\nthe acetate, they do run through into\neach other to give a single, complete work.\nThroughout this the lead is split\nbetween Van Leer on his keyboards\nand Akkerman on lead guitar. The\nrhythm is steady without being over-powering, with Colin Allen producing a competent first showing. Van\nLee tends to get the majority of the\nlead (on organ, synthesizer and\npiano) but the longest single section\ngives Akkerman a free rein to show\nhis prowess. Although each section\nhas its own particular feeling they\nblend excellently to build into a climax in the final two, short tracks.\ncon td. on page 7\nRECORDS\n\n"

    "content": "4 FELIX 14th May, 1974\nEDITORIAL\nSunday press date is usually for two things:\n(1) to check and re-distribute copy already set;\n(2) , to fill the remaining gaps. Sometimes, as in\nthe last issue, this was not possible because of\nthe great excess of articles, etc.\nWhich brings me to my first point in this edi-to rial. FELIX\nThe comments that were made recently about\nFelix being controlled by the Executive is, as\nNorman Sayles put it last week, bullshit. In fact,\nthe editorial that I wanted to print last issue had to\nbe scrapped due to lack of room. First priority\nsince I took over has been to print what YOU want\nto read and to persuade people (such as society\nchairmen) to provide this material. Second priority\nhas been to try and find room for ALL articles that\nare handed to me, usually at the expense of any\nspace-fillers that I had produced. Third priority,\nand one that I have rarely had a chance to use\nbecause of the success of my first and second\npriorities, has been for me to use Felix as an\nopportunity to act as editor and make Editorial\ncomments. AND when I have been able to do\nthis it has been usually in the form of an Hon.\nSsc's piece and not personal comments. My overall comment to the IC communist party would\ntherefore be \"Stick your comments about Felix\nup your ass\" (to be polite).\nFREE SPEECH\nThe second part concerns the disputed NUS\nracial is m motion amendment on fascist speakers.\nOn this page I have tried to draw together all the\nvarious factual items on this business referring to\nhappenings since last issue (see also letters page).\nThe news from City Univerity is good, that from\nOxford is bad. Mr. Phillips, president-elect, has\ncommented to me several times since conference\nthat the violence part of the amendment is but a small part of it. He has also commented that it\nwould only be the International Socialists and\nmembers of the International Marxist Group that\nwould actually use physical violence to break up\nmeetings. Fine rhetoric Trev but, with NUS policy\nas decided at conference (and by a minority vote\nremember) the violence at Oxford has the full\nofficial backing of the NUS. If the same thing\nhappens at the meeting planned for IC next Monday that too will have NUS's support. BUT does\nit have your support. I know not. But you must\nshow it. The way to do this is to turn up to the\nnext UGM, to be held on Thursday, May 23rd, in\nthe Union Concert Hall. This is primarily to choose\na delegation for the emergency NUS conference\non grants on June 15th. This, however, as you\nsee from the City University news will also be\nimportant because of the racial is m discussion.\nAfter delegation elections, there will be motions\nIf there are more than 300 present, the motion on\nracial is m and disruption of meetings will be dis\ncussed, in the form of a right wing motion opposing the NUS amendment. If there are less than\n300 the left and/or the piss artists will call\nquorum, just as they did last week, and we will be\nleft with (a) no official policy of our own on this\nimportant issue and (b) an inference that we sup\nport the NUS view.\nI THEREFORE CALL ON YOU TO COME OUT\nEVEN IF IT'S FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS YEAR\nAND THEN NEVER AGAIN, AND SHOW YOUR\nOPPOSITION TO VIOLENCE.\nNUS EXECUTIVE STATEMENT ON RACISM\nCITY UNIV.\nPEACE INITIATIVE\nA campaign to remove\nthe now famed racial is m amendment from i the policy of the NUS has\nbeen started by the City\nUniversity Student's Union.\nQuoting the following\nfrom the United Nations\nUniversal Declaration of\nHuman Rights they hope\nto gain enough support\nfrom colleges to enable\nthe topic to be discussed\nat the Emergency Conference that has already\nbeen organised for a discussion on grants.\nArticle 19 \u2014 Everyone has the right to\nfreedom of opinion and\nexpression; this right includes freedom to hold\nopinion without interference and to seek, receive\nand impart information\nand ideas through any\nmedia and regardless of\nfrontiers.\nArticle 20 \u2014 Everyone has the right to\nfreedom of peaceful\nassembly and associa-tion.\nTo enable the topic to\nbe discussed they need\nthe support of at least\nten colleges, and they\nalready have the support of five.\nOn Saturday, May\n16th at the City University, St. John Street,\nLondon EC1 they are\nholding a meeting to discuss a motion to go to\nExtraordinary Conference and other relevant\nmatters to this question.\nPrimarily this meeting\nwill be to discuss ways\nof repealing the policy.\nThe NUS Easter Conference passed an 8-page motion condemning racism and the growing discrimination\nagainst NUS's overseas\nmembers. Press attention has focused on one\nparagraph of one amendment which was included in that motion, the\nparagraph in which Conference determined to\ndeny a platform to organisations such as the\nMonday Club and the\nNational Front.\nWe have to make clear\nprecisely what this involves us, and our mem-be rs, in doing. Firstly,\nemphatically, we are not\ngoing to send round a \"heavy squad\" to break\nup meetings. Neither are\nwe going to try to restrict the activities of\nthe Conservative Party\namong students. Conservative students have\nthe right to pro pag and is e among students like any\nother political group. We\ndo not intend to infringe\nthat right in any way.\nWhat we do intend to\ndo is to deny platforms\nto the apostles of racial\nhatred. If this is \"limit-ing freedom of speech\"\nthen we plead guilty. But\nwe believe there is a more important freedom\nat stake: The freedom to\nlive without discrimination on the basis of race.\nThis is a part of one\nof the major campaigns\nstudents will be asked to\nfight in the coming\nmonths: against discrimination, against racist\nlegislation, for the\nstrengthening of the race\nrelations act, and for a multi-racial multi-cult ur ral society.\nThe Right to Preach\nRacial Hatred\nSumming up on the\namendment at the Conference, NUS National\nSecretary Steve Parry\nsaid that had we known\nin advance what we\nknow now of Hitler's Germany, we would\nhave wanted to temper\nour concern for free\nspeech with our concern\nfor humanity, and to refuse him a platform.\nThere can be very few\npeople who would disagree with this. Those\nwho oppose our position\npresumably believe that\nthere is no danger whatsoever of the Nazi type\nof racial discrimination\nhere.\nWe believe this view\nis dangerously com plac ent. The most vicious\nracial hatred is being deliberately fomented by\nwell organised extreme\nright wing groups in this\ncountry, some of them\nin a position to influence\nthe Conservative Party.\nThe last Government\ngave way to that section\nof its supporters, in some\nof its statements and\nlegislation, to a truly\nhorrifying extent. When\nracists can influence\nGovernment policy so\nprofoundly, then we cannot afford acute pangs\nof liberal conscience\nabout denying the racist\nhis right to hate in pub-li c. Racial Discrimination\nbe the Government\nLest anyone doubts\nthat racists have influenced Government dec is ions, we wish to outline\nin particular the discrimination practised against\nVIOLENCE ERUPTS\nMr. Harold Soref,\ndeputy chairman of the\nright-wing Monday Club,\nwas forced to abandon\na meeting at Oxford\nUnion last week. He had\nbeen speaking for about\n40 minutes and was concluding his speech when\na group of students\nforced their way through\nthe Union entrance.\nUnion officials had\nattempted to barricade\nthe way with desks,\nwhich were pushed\naway, and by closing\ndoors, which were made\nof glass and were\nsmashed by the mob.\nThe mob totalled about\n25.\nIn the room where\nthe meeting was being\nheld, members barricaded the way with\nchairs and benches\nwhilst Mr. Soref beat a hasty retreat through a rear door that had to be\nbroken open. During\nthe retreat to his car he\nhad to be helped over a six foot high wall. There\nwas no physical violence\non Mr. Soref though this\nis no doubt mainly due\nto the fact that he was\nno longer present in the\nroom when the mob\narrived.\nOxford police have\nannounced that arrests\nhave been made, with\none man being suspected of causing criminal\ndamage.\nThe fact that this\nkind of violence now has\nofficial NUS backing no\ndoubt encouraged people\nto take part in this disgusting behaviour (see\neditorial).\nFootnote: Oxford University student union is\nin the red. Mr. Sullivan,\nthe president, has not\nbeen paid for two weeks\nand there are debts of\n\u00a31500. The lack of\nmoney apparently arises\nfrom the fact that only\ntwo colleges had paid\ntheir subscriptions.\nthe 10 per cent of our\nmembership who come\nfrom overseas. This is\nnot racial hatred from a few harmless, sick-mind-ed individuals.This isra-cia l discrimination practised by the Government,\nencouraged by the last\nGovernment, and in\nmany cases, actually enshrined in the legislation\nof this country.\n(1) Overseas students'\ntuition fees were raised\nto over three times the\nfees for home students\nfrom about \u00a380 p.a. to\nabout \u00a3250 p.a.(2) Because Local Authities are not allowed to\nsub sid is e their lodgings,\nas they frequently do for\nBritish students, overseas students pay up to\nsix times as much for\ntheir accommodation.\n(3) VAT was not imposed on student hostels\u2014\nunless those hostels\nwere for students from\noverseas.\n,4) The 1971 Immigration Act ensures almost\ncompletely that the only\nway students can supplement their income\u2014by\nvacation work\u2014is barred to students from\noverseas.\n(5) The 1971 Immigration Act decreed that\noverseas students whose\nactivities were thought to\nbe \"against the public\ngood\" is one of those\numbrella phrases which\ncivil libertarians have always protested must\nnever be embodied in\nlaw because it can be\ninterpreted any way you\nlike. Such a formulation\nwould never be tolerated\nin legislation aimed at\nour own citizens: why\nshould we accept it\npeaceably because it applies only to foreigners?\nIn the case of deported\nNorth London Polytechnic student Aristides\nMavroskoufis it was interpreted to cover what\nthe authorities thought\nhe might possibly do on\nthe evidence of his political activities in Greece.\n(6) Tory Home Secretary Robert Carr made\nproposals in the House\nof Commons on 6th December, 1973, which\nwould have the effect of\nincreasing the h arras s ment of overseas stud-ents. He proposed that\nthe Home Office would\nmonitor their progress\nvery carefully and receive regular reports\nfrom their college authorities; that the minimum number of hours\nper week they study\nshould be raised; and\nthat they should be prevented from changing\ntheir courses. His pro-pos als, if put into effect,\nwould mean that Universities and Colleges\nwould have to have two\nsets of regulations; one\nset for British students\nand another more stringent set for foreigners.\n(7) Overseas postgraduate students will have\nto pay up to \u00a31500 a year tuition fees if the\nrecommendations of the\nParliamentary Expenditure Committee earlier\nthis year are adopted.\nThis would ensure that\nno overseas students\ncould do postgraduate\nwork in this country unless his parents were\nvery rich indeed.\nNUS believes that\nthese measures are the\nmeasures of a Government influenced by rac-i a lists. We have watched organised racism at work\nin every level of our\nsociety, including the\nGovernment. We have\nbeen powerless to stop\nit. But we can stop racists from speaking in the\nplaces where we work\nand study and attacking\nthe basic democratic\nrights of our members.\nThe High Priests of Race\nHatred\nWe have been told\nthat it is a denial of free\nspeech to stop members\nand sympathisers of particular political groups\nfrom speaking. Does this\nmean that the NUS does\nnot believe in free\nspeech?\nOur answer is no, it\nmeans nothing of the\nkind. But we believe\nthere are limitations on\nthe right of free speech.\nThe laws of libel and\nslander are one example;\nthe race relations act is\nanother. The following\nare the kinds of people\nto whom we will refuse\na platform:\nEnoch Powell: \" . . .\nwide-grinning pica ninnies... who cannot\nspeak English\" (Birming-ham, 2 1 / 4 / 6 8 ) .\nAir-Commodore Oddie:\nof the National Front National Council \u2014 \" Of course I am a racialist''\n(Observer 3 0 / 3 / 6 9 ) .\nJohn Tyndalh of the National Front\u2014\"The Jew\nis like a poisonous maggot feeding on a body\nin a state of advanced\ndecay\".

I: An\nex-chairman of the Monday Club, who congratulated Mr. Powell on\nspeaking about the\n\"threat to Britain's future from the time-bomb\nof a million or more un-as simi l able coloured im\nmigrants\".\nGeorge Young: An ex-chairman of the Monday\nClub\u2014\"There is, and\nwill be widespread miscegenation at the fringes . . . no one knows the\nconsequences\" (Birm-ingham 2 4 / 4 / 6 8 ) .\nWe do not see why we\nshould assist the propagation of racism. We call\non all our members to\nrefuse these men plat-forms.\n\n"

After giving some\nfascinating information such as the fact that\nabout 60% of the world's population can't speak\nEnglish she established that many overseas students at this College do have difficulties with the\nEnglish language and that these difficulties\nseverely handicap their academic and social\nlife. Then she goes on to pass her judgement on\nthis situation: \"That students should have such\nhandicaps is not advisable (?!): one might even\ncall it ludicrous, inadmissible, or to quote a member of the board of studies immoral\". Obviously Ida doesn't approve. But who is to be\nblamed for this \"immoral\" and \"inadvisable\"\nstate of affairs? We have to read on to the end\nof the judgement to get the answer. But first we\nget some advice from the wise judge: \"clearly\nstudents should have a sufficient mastery of the\nEnglish language before embarking on a highly\ndemanding course of study.\" The judgement\nends with: \"Those without such ability should\nobtain it before entering college\". At last we\nhave been told who was being tried \u2014 the overseas students who can't speak English. They\nhave been found guilty of bringing about this\n\"immoral\" and \"inadvisable\" situation by not\nlearning English before they come to the College. Having established the guilt the guilty\nones are sentenced, in the proposals which come\nfurther on, to taking a compulsory English exam\nbefore they are allowed to enter the College.\nIda who is supposed to represent overseas students has acted as judge and jury to them. We\nhad heard of people acting as both judge and\njury but that is not enough for Ida because she\nwants to be judge, jury and defence.\nContinued on Page 8\nSOUTHSIDE BAR\nMuch of the bar committees time this year\nhas been spent dealing with renovations to\nSouthside bar. These have been split into two\nphases, the first of which was carried out over\nEaster. This was to remove what was left of the\ncarpet and replace with Courtaulds AMTICO\ntiles, to have fixed the wooden panelling of the\nbar, to have the old furniture completely re-upholstered, and to buy new stools. The total\ncost of phase I will be of the order of \u00a31,500.\nPhase II will involve moving the present partition between the bar and the lounge out, past\nthe stairs, towards the TV, so creating a new\narea for games\u2014darts and bar-billiards.\nAny suggestions that members of the Union or\nAcademic staff may wish to make should be\nsent to me.\nDavid Sinclair,\nDeputy President ICU,\nIC Bar Chairman.\nALL THE BARS ARE GETTING SHORT\nOF GLASSES\nWill Union members return glasses from\ntheir rooms.\nD.

    "content": "14th May, 1974 FELIX 3\n\u00bb Thursday May 2nd saw Imperial College Union\nGeneral Meeting back in the Great Hall after a break\ndue to the power crisis (remember that?). A varied\nagenda pulled in one of the largest attendances if!\na long while, with a quorum nearly being reached.\nThe reports took up the first part of the meeting,\nwith discussion livening up when Mr. Wadsworth\nreported on the Union Exec's stand over Essex University (basically outlined by Norm Sayles in his\npurple patch last issue). Mr. John Lane, last year's President, asked a number of questions which were\nanswered by varying members of the Exec. Several\nof the replies brought howls of approval, showing\nthe mass of su port that existed for the Executive's line. Eventually it was proposed that the report be\naccepted. This was done, overwhelmingly so, thereby showing to the more militant aspects of the Union\nthat they were not representative of the majority\nfeeling over this issue.\nElections took up the\nmajority of the remain-der, with three candidates for the post of\nSCAB Chairman and nine\ncandidates for the six _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ floor reps on Council. ' \"~ \u2122 1\nDue to this excess of candidates there was little\ntime left at the end of the meeting for debate. This\nwas made even more difficult by the fact that most\npeople appeared to have come for the elections\nonly, and there was a considerable drop in the numbers present when these had finished.\nThe first motion on the agenda referred to the\nNUS's motion on Racialism and Overseas or particularly the section referring to the disruption of\nmeetings held by Racialist groups. This arose mainly\nfrom the members of the college Conservative Society and appeared to have quite a large amount of\nsupport at the meeting. However, after we had had\nthe proposal speech there was a move to move\nstraight to a vote. Seeing that the meeting was behind the motion and was almost certain to pass it\nU. G.M. so that it would become Union policy Mr. East, that\nfamous IMG figure, decided that in the interests of\ndemocratic freedom he would challenge the quorum.\nThere wasn'ta quorum present and so the meeting\nwas closed.\nIt is important to realise that at the moment, in\nthe absence of any definite policy. Imperial College\nUnion would be regarded by the world at large as\nsupporting this despicable piece of NUS garbage.\nThe reasoning behind the NUS amendment (which\nsupports any action that members may care< to take\nagainst racialist speakers, including the disruption\nof their meetings) is illogical. Judging from the coverage it has been receiving in the press (both from\nletters and articles) it is fairly apparent that what\nlittle esteem existed in the public's eye for the\nNUS has now all but disappeared following the\npassing of this amend-~ ~ \u2014 \u2014\nSf~' \u2014 \u2014 - ~ \u2022 \u2014\nment. It is also important\nto realise that it was not\npassed on a majority\nvote. The voting figures\nfor the amendment were\n204,618 for, 182,760\nagainst, and 57,625 ab-^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ stained. This was not a\" \u2122 \u2014\n' ~ \" ~ ~ ~ ' \u2014\nmajority vote. The reason that the overall motion was voted in so heavily, was because it does contain a lot of very good\npolicy.\nA Union meeting has been called for Thursday,\n23rd May, mainly because we have to elect a delegation for the NUS emergency conference, to be\nheld in mid-June, that has been called to discuss\nour attitude to the announcement on grants for\n1974/75. Hopefully, there will also be enough time\nat our meeting for us to be able to discuss the\nracial is m motion and be able to express our feelings\nand attitudes towards it publicly.\nPLEASE SUPPORT THE NEXT MEETING. IT IS\nIN THE INTERESTS OF THE UNION\u2014AND THE\nUNION IS YOU\nP.G. GRANTS Call for increase by\nCollege committee\nFollowing its second\nmeeting last Tuesday the\nExploratory Committee\nis expected to come out\nin favour of higher\ngrants for postgraduates,\nrejecting the proposals\nfor a system of loan supplements contained in\nthe House of Common's Expenditure Committee's report on Postgraduate Education.\nAfter discussions on\nthe Students' Union's request for a rejection\nof these loans in pri nci ple, the committee decided that it should state\nwhat it felt to be the\nideal situation without\nconsidering any possible\nrestrictions either financial or political which\nmight constrain the gov-ern ment. In accordance\nwith these principles the\ncommittee will call for\na full grant for postgraduates to be fixed at the\nlevel of the average net\nRCS A ALL 3RD YEAR PHYSICS\nPLEASE NOTE\nIn an effort to make the RCSA become a \"more\nmeaningful concept to the grass roots\" a new idea\nis being tried out for all people in 3rd year Physics\nthis term. Several volunteers, namely (ego trips\nhere) Miss Caroline Bingham, Miss Penny Thorogood, Mrs. Jaquetta Selley, Mr. Dave Dawson, Mr.\nlap Oram, and Mr. Andy Lewcock, have agreed to\nact as live \"dead-letter-boxes\" in order to keep\npeople from this year's Physics II in touch with\neach other and with the RCSA.\nAs this gallant throng of Physicists (?) goes into\nthe great wide world to seek employment, it is\nhq ped that each one of them will write at least once\na year to one of the people listed above, just to\nkeep in touch. Not only will this enable anyone\nfrom the year to be contacted and told of RCSA\n(or Physics II) reunions, booze-ups, etc., but it does\nhave a serious side to it. As the great Alfred E. Newman once said: \"Learn by others' mistakes, 'cos\nyou will never make enough yourself\". Applying this\nmastery of logic to our cause, anyone in the 1974\nPhysics II will be able to write into one of the dead-letter-boxes, or the RCSA and request information\nor help( for instance in the case of accommodation\nin the West Country); this request will then be sent\nto the member(s) of the year who are most likely\nto be able to help/and hopefully the two 'physicists'\ncan then resolve the problem between them.\nThis provides a new dimension to the RCSA.\nNot only does it deal with RCS as a whole, but it\nhelps to keep year groups together; not only does\nit fulfil a social function, but it Has a very worthwhile and serious aspect to it.\nThe whole year-group organisation is being sponsored by the RCSA, and it is hoped that you (Yes,\nthat's you Physics III, stop falling asleep in the\nback row, who threw that dart?), all of you, will\njoin the RCSA, however I must point out that it is\nnot essential to do so before your name is added\nto our mailing list.\nSo, now (apart from producing \u00a315 life-member-ship fee) all you have to do is decide whom you\nwish to write to-' Caroline, Penny, Jaquetta, Dave,\nlan or Andy. (If you don't know any of them, pick\na name and write anyway. You could be pleasantly\nsurprised).\nOK. That's it. Finished now.\nAndy\nWAKEMAN TRUST\nFour Cambridge students have been\nentrusted by an anonymous donor\nwith \u00a32,000 a year to give away to\ncommunity service and community\naction groups and projects. The Secretary of the new Trust, 22 year old\nMike Richards of West Lodge, Old\nHeadington, Oxford, said:\n\"The Trust is designed to give\naway small sums to struggling groups\nthat might not get enough support\nfrom anyone else.

Because of\nthis it has been said that\nthe society has lain dor-mant. This is not so.\nSince then we have\nadded two more scalps\nto our belt in the shape\nof Thomas' Hospital and\nSussex. Alas, we have\nalso slipped to a defeat\nagainst Kent as well.\nThus the league title that\nwe so earnestly sought\nin the early part of the\nseason is now in the\nhands of the enemy.\nHowever, on Monday\n6th May the society\nachieved a goal far more\nsignificant than merely\nthe league. On that day\nwe carried off the South\nand East Universities\ntitle for the first time in\nIC's history. Indeed if\none looks through the\nsociety archives one\nfinds that IC has never\nbeen placed better than\nthird in the Championship, and that was achieved by the notorious\n'47 side that also carried off the league title.\nIt is in this historical\nperspective that one\nmust judge this victory\nand it seems that any\nway you look at it the\nachievements of the '73-'74 boys are amongst\nour greatest.\nThe Championship\nwas won in great style\nby six shots, a margin\nwhich left IC the easy\nwinners and everyone\nelse nowhere. However\nthis easy margin conceals much of the struggles that took place\nduring the course of the\ncompetition. After the\nfirst round in which the\nIC lads had not played\nup to their capabilities\nwe found ourselves two\nshots off the lead. The\nleaders, Southampton,\nwere in fine fettle over\nlunch and started the\nfinal round strongly. The\nwriting seemed to be on\nthe wall. However, the\nturning point came when\nBill Calderwood and\nRich Brown attacked the\ncourse in no uncertain\nterms and with a burst of\nbirdies unprecedented\nin the competition's history made the leader\nboard flash red so often\nthat many motorists\nmistook it for traffic\nlights. The lift this gave\nthe other lads cannot\nproperly be assessed,\nbut what can be said is\nthat the society inexorably crept up on Southampton until, from the\n29th hole onwards, the\ntournament was clearly\nto be ours.\nOther points worthy of\nmention is that Bill Calderwood took the individual title and Rich\nBrown the best net t.All in all it was an IC cleanup and all the opposition\ncould take away with\nthem were a couple of\nrunners-up spoons.\nThe Championship\nwinners: Nigel Foster\n(capt.), Bill Calderwood\n(v. capt.).

We agree with\nIda that a serious problem exists and that\nsomething must be\ndone about it. Ida\nblames the overseas\nstudents for the situation and hence puts the\nresponsibility for solving it on the overseas\nstudents. We believe\nthat the College is to be\nblamed for this situation\nand so responsible for\nsolving it. Let us just\nsee what brilliant proposals Ida's committee,\nafter discussing the subject at length, intends\nto make to the Board\nof Studies. Firstly that\noverseas students should take a compulsory English exam be-fer e entering the College and that their acceptance should be\nsubject to passing this\nexam. It is not clear\nexactly how taking an\nexam is going to solve\nthe problem. It will just\nmean that those whose\nproblems we are trying\nto solve will not be able\nto come to the College.\nContinued from Page 1\nIn a way this does solve\nthe problem but the\nquestion is in whose in-te rest. Certainly not in\nthe interest of those who\nsuffer from it. We believe that any idea of a compulsory exam is\ntotally unacceptable to\noverseas students because it imposes yet another discriminatory\nmeasure against them\nover and above the discrimination that already\nexists. We find it incredible that a committee\nwhich is supposed to\ndefend the interests of\noverseas students should recommend a measure to the College\nthat is totally against the\ninterests of overseas\nstudents and would further restrict the possibilities for overseas students to come and\nstudy here. This especially at a time when the\ngovernment is intending\nto impose further restrictions in the form of\nincreasing fees.\nThe second recommendation for an English language course to\nbe made available during the summer before\ncoming to the College is\na little more to the\npoint but it seems from\nthe recommendation\nthat the overseas student is supposed to pay\nfor this. It is totally unacceptable that overseas students most of\nwhom do not get a grant\nand who already pay\ndiscriminatory fees should also pay for this\nlanguage course. This\nwould be yet another\nfinancial impediment to\nthem. Some of the\n\"other alternatives\" suggested are interesting.\nOne is that there should\nbe an English Language\n'O' level entrance re-quire ment. According\nto Ida the obvious disadvantage with this is\n\"in that such examinations are not taken in a number of countries\".\nWell if Ida had any clues\nabout the problem she\nis trying to solve she\nwould realise that there\nis an even more obvious\ndisadvantage. Most overseas students from\ncountries where English\nis not widely spoken\nwould probably not be\nable to pass English 'O' level when they have\neven graduated from IC\nnever mind passing it\nbefore they come to this\nCollege.\nThere is only one way\nin which this language\nproblem can be solved\nin the interest of overseas students. The College must provide a FREE English language\ncourse during the summer for new overseas\nstudents and there\nshould be NO compulsory exams at the end\nof this course. At the\nsame time some of the\nrooms in the halls instead of being used as\nhotel rooms for summer\ntourists should be made\navailable for these stu-dents. In this way it will\nbe possible for the largest possible number of\noverseas students to\nYHA CANOEING\nOR \"WYE WE DID ITr r17.30: Friday the 26th April: our\nintrepid band of heroes journeyed\nforth into the setting sun to the distant\nlands of the West Country, ably supported by an equally intrepid band of\nheroes from Bedford College. This,\nthe climax of the Hostelling Year at\nIC was to prove to be as memorable\nand as strenuous a week-end as any\nof the previous hiking trips, writes our\ncorrespondent with sore and blistered\nhands.\nWe stayed at the Welsh Bicknor\nYouth Hostel, With Richard, Mike,\nLaurence and Phil suffering the fate\nof a four-man tent in the grounds of\nthe hostel. The hostel is to be remembered perhaps for the painfully\nlong journey to the men's washroom,\nthe Cagney impersonating warden,\nand the surplus of lemon curd and\nconsequent lack of thick cut marm a lade.\nSaturday, we travelled some ten\nmiles upstream to our embarkation\npoint, hired our canoes and cast off\ninto the midge infested upper reaches\nof the Wye. Navigating down to Ross,\nwe stopped to dry off in the nearest\npub, as some of our company had\nalready tasted the waters of the river,\nand proceeded to make ourselves unpopular with yet another landlord.\nFurther downstream, we passed the\nimpressive Goodrich Castle, where\nthe author and John \"Guess my\nmiddle name\" Allen made a swift\nrecon a is s ance of the said antiquity.\nSunday saw us preparing, in our\nstill wet clothes and with diminished\nenthusiasm, for the second half of the\nvoyage down to Monmouth, taking in\nthe well known beauty spot at Symonds Yat and its accompanying rapids\nwhich struck terror into the hearts of\nsuch stalwarts as Margaret \"I'm only\nhere for the brandy\" Bassett. So having stopped at \" Ye Olde Ferrie Inn\"\nto pluck up courage (or was it Whitbread) for the descent, we shot the\nsaid rapids which proved somewhat\npathetically anticlimactic, so much so\nthat a number of stalwarts dragged\ntheir canoes up the bank to repeat\nthe performance, with Mr. Avison\ngoing on for a third attempt, and\nprobably would have continued ad\ninfinitum (or nausea m), had time\npermitted.\nThe occasion is to be remembered,\nif only for Mr. Welford's gallant demonstration of shooting the rapids with\nneither canoe nor paddle, a feat to\ngo down in the Guinness Book of\nIdiots. Congratulations are due to\nTom and Alison for their record-breaking attempt to navigate the Wye\nunderwater and commiseration to\nMartin who had to bail them out. A special thanks to Malcolm Q for not\nalluding to a certain factory in Slough,\nmore than was really necessary.\nNote\u2014ULU Y HA are arranging a folk evening at Ivinghoe Y H and a ramble in the wilds of Bedfordshire\non Saturday, 1Bth May. Meet at Euston at 10.00. PGC\nSQUASH\nOn the whole, it has\nbeen a good season for\nthe squash club. Of the\nfour teams in the London Univ. League, IC 1\nagain won the 1st division with IC 2 finishing\nabout half way down\nthe table of the same\ndivision (10 teams in-vol ved). In the second divi-sion, IC 3 finished very\nnear the bottom, indeed\nonly just escaping relegation. This was partly\ndue to the No. 2 string,\nG. Dickson, being ill for\nmost of the Spring and\nbeing unable to play.\nThe 4th team did pretty\nwell in the 3rd division\nand were unlucky in not\ngaining promotion, finishing 3rd in the table.\nThe success of these\nteams has, in a large\npart, been due to the\nregularity in which the\nsame players have\nturned out for each\nmatch, so enabling\nstrong teams to be\npicked each week. I thank all the players\nconcerned!\nUnfortunately, in the\nend of season knockout tournament, IC 1\nwere tragically beaten\n3-1 in the Semi-final by\nGuys Hospital, M. Kenyon, the no. 1 string, being the only one to win.\nI. Menzie had a good\nmatch, eventually losing\n3-1 but A. Khan and R. Smith both seemed to\nhave off-nights and instead of winning as was\nexpected, both disappointingly lost 3-0.\nI would like to say a big thank-you to some\nof the IC 1 and IC 2\nplayers' wives who\nprovided us with food\nafter the home matches\n\u2014saving us from the\nfate of the 'bouncing\nMooney sandwich' and\nalso to J. Lloyd\u2014the\nsecretary and G. Dickson, the treasurer, who\nboth did conscientious\nwork for the club.\nM.R. Kenyon,\n(Captain ICSRC)\nhave a good enough\nknowledge of English to\ncope with their lectures\nbefore they start their\ncourse. Free English\nclasses should of\ncourse continue throughout the year and\nthese should be at\nseveral different levels\nto cater for the needs of\ndifferent students.\nAs far as the overseas\nstudents committee is\nconcerned, the new\ncommittee which was\nelected last term and is\nalready taking over\nfrom the previous one,\nunlike the retiring one\nis made up mostly of\noverseas students and\nas such we hope would\nbe able to distinguish\nmore clearly between\nwhat is and what is not\nin the interests of overseas students. The fact\nthat last term a group\nof overseas students\nstood for election for\nthis committee and\nwere elected is itself a reflection of the growing concern among\noverseas students about\ntheir increasing problems, among which\nlanguage is only one,\nand the inability of the\nprevious committee to\ndo anything about solving them as is clearly\ndemonstrated by their\nconfused approach to\nthe language problem.\nThe NUS Easter conference decided that a campaign must be\nlaunched to end discrimination against overseas students. It is\nin the Colleges that this\ncampaign is going to\ntake place and we hope\nthat at IC the new overseas students committee will take an important role in launching\nthis campaign. But it is\nonly with our full support that the committee\ncan do this. The Persian\nSociety will give the new\ncommittee its active\nsupport for as long as\nthis committee fights for\nthe interest of overseas\nstudents. We urge all\nother national societies\nand individual students\nto do the same.\nSport in the Long Vac\nICPGG are arranging an interdepartmental 5-a side soccer\ntournament at the start of the\nlong vac, for PG's, UG's and\nStaff who are still at college after\nthe end of term. This will be at\nHarlington on a Wednesday after-noon, and transport from the\nUnion will be FREE. Anyone who can form a team drop a note in\nthe PG pigeon hole in the IC Union Office, or contact one of\nthe undersigned by MAY 31st. Tennis players also welcome to\ntravel on the coach (\ned \u2014\na list\nwill appear outside the Union Bar\nnearer the time).\nTom Abraham (Elec Eng) In t3103;Rod Little (Maths, 53PG) Int 7-21; John Porter (Metal-lu rgy) In t4052; Pete Waite\n(Maths, Huxley).\n\n"

The same was happening in the United\nStates, he said, but\nsince it was ahead in\ngetting out of the de-press ion, it would start\na new recruiting drive\nsooner than Britain.\nThe fall-off in recruitment was also affecting\nenrolment on undergraduate courses to\nsuch an extent that in\nthree year's time British\nindustry would hardly\nhave any trained young\nmen and the ones there\nPostgra duat e research is a quite cheap\nsource of support to\nboth research and\nteaching activities in\nuniversity departments\naccording to a statement issued recently by\nthe Senate of Strathclyde University.\nThe Senate, which is\nhighly critical of the recent House of Commons\nExpenditure Committee's report on postgraduate education,\nsays that any drop in\npostgraduate research\nwould have immediate\nand serious cons e que n ces.\n\"Critics are in general plainly unaware of\nthe linked relationship\nin universities between\nstaff, postgraduates and\nundergraduates,\" says\nthe senate, whose statement has been sent to\nmembers of both Houses of Parliament,\nprincipals and vice-chancellors of all British universities and\nmany other interested\nbodies and individuals.\nRecent publications,\nincluding the Expenditure Committee's report,\nhad implied that much\nuniversity postgraduate\nstudy was a luxury\nwhich could be trimmed without loss either\nNUSS:\nThe NUSS (National\nUnion of School Students) have been producing press statements recently about\nNALGO, and about a children's strike in Nottingham.\n\"It is IMPERITIVE\",\ndeclares the statement,\n\"that pupils are able to\nuse the facilities available at public libraries.\"\nThis arises from the\nNALGO action over\nLondon allowances. The\nNUSS are afraid that\nBRAIN\nDRAIN\nwere would go to the\nUnited States.\nLord Bowden said\nthat the consequences\nof inflation were so appalling that unless the\nproblem was solved he\ndespaired of the future.\nInflation had gone so\nfar that in the past few\nyears it was possible\nfor people to be living in\nhouses that were earning more than they\nwere. The increase in\nthe book value of about\n18 million houses last\nyear was \u00a345,000\u00a350,000m., which was as\ngreat as the total domestic products.\nReturns on short-term\nbuilding society loans\nwere 15 to 2 0 % last\nyear but ICI's returns\nwere only 5% and the\npaper trade 2%. As the\nto the nation's economy\nor to its academic life.\n\"The tendentious\nnature of this approach\ncan be detected both\nin the use of language\nand in the deployment\nof statistics,\" the senate\nsays.\n\"When an official report speaks of the 'cosy\nacademic atmosphere'\nwe may well suspect the\nobjectivity of its authors\nand their familiarity with\nuniversity life.\"\nThe report argued\nthat too many talented\nyoung graduates slipped into postgraduate\nwork because \"it must\nseem to them to be a natural progression\nafter a good first de-g ree\": but if an honours\ndegree had not stimulated the student's intellectual curiosity, had it\nnot failed in its purpose?\nIt was all very well to\ntalk about immediately\nrelevant studies, but nobody really knew either\nwhich particular advance in knowledge\nwould ultimately be\nsocially relevant or how\ntraining in research\nmight ultimately be de-ploy ed.A recent working\ngroup of the British\nAssociation had pointed\nout that scientific re-Illiterates\n\"many school students\nwill be denied the facilities available in libraries\nfor refer ance\". Other mistakes were:\n\"im mie di ate education a I crisis in London\"; \"re-spec ti vere s pons obili ties\"; \"effects\" used as\na verb instead of\n\"affects\", \"remi dy\";\"s u posed ly\" and \"re-in station\" used twice\ninstead of \"re-in state-ment.\"\nThese statements\nboth bear the address\ncommunity valued productive industry less\nthan speculators, how\ncould one seriously advise a schoolboy to become a chemical en-g in e er? Lord Bowden pointed\nout that students are influenced early on by the\nprospect of not being\nable to g \"et a job. The\nMassachusetts Institute\nof Technology in the\nUnited States had produced 29 graduates in\nchemical engineering\nlast year compared with\nits usual output of about\n100.\nAs for metallurgy, on\nwhich the prospects for\natomic energy depend-ed, the USSR had produced 5,000 graduates\nlast year and Japan\n3,000, whereas Britain\nhad produced only 200.\nFour years ago it was\ndifficult for metallurgists\nto get jobs and the result was that UMIST had\nonly been able to enrol\nsix undergraduates this\nyear although they had\nthe capacity for 36.\nsearch provided a backstop for much of tech-no logy. \"Set up against\nthis wider view, the allegations that this or that\nemployer has no immediate need for PhDs\nseem trivial and are in\nany event not borne out\nby our experience\".\nThe postgraduate was\nnot simply a sponge; he\npresented a challenge\nto staff and an example\nto undergraduates.\nFurthermore, postgraduate study was the\nproving ground for\nfuture university staff.\n\"Nobody would pretend that the possession\nof a PhD is the sole criterion of potentiality as\na university teacher, but\nit removes one big area\nof uncertainty in the\nminds of selectors,\" the\nsenate says.\nProfessor S. G.E. Lythe, the university's vice-principal, said that\nthe university's research\ncommittee considered\nthat no serious attempt\nhad been made to produce a reasoned reply\nto the Expenditure Committee's report.
