This brand of \u2018feminism\u2019 is sold by the corporate world to prove patriarchal\ncapitalism is justifiable, as long as it flies a pink flag\nand is led by a woman. Liberal, a cover term for patri-archal, feminism operates under the assumption that\nmen\u2019s lives, systems, and actions are the desideratum.\nThe discrepancies between this faction of feminists and\ntheir advocacy for equality with men in a fundamentally\nunchanged world, and a true women\u2019s liberation movement are immense. The issue I am going to focus on is\nthe emphasis on men\u2019s mental health as if it were the\nsine qua non in feminism.\nAs a supporter of a revolutionary women\u2019s liberation\nmovement that insists on a changed world as opposed to\nseeking equality with men in the status quo, a conservative aim that is itself ill-defined, I am no stranger to con-troversy, and in that spirit, I present my concerns on the\ndiscourse surrounding men\u2019s mental health. Another\nopinion piece I read critiqued feminism in general and\nthe writer asked, \u2018How often do we see feminists stand\nup for the hardships of men?\u2019 My answer is too often. I\npresume the writer wrote their piece rhetorically, failing\nto justify why these so-called hardships are relatively\nsignificant compared to women\u2019s true hardships.\nMen\u2019s mental health is often viewed as the systematic\nsubjugation of men as a social class. Many feminists will\nagree that patriarchy oppresses men as they sacrifice the\nability for emotional expression. Some of us take a different approach. Phrases that imply men are oppressed\nby the patriarchy at all reduce it to a random and aimless\nsystem with individual men and women as bad actors,\nrather than an institutionalised entity with men as a social class being material beneficiaries, in which women\nare systematically stripped of their personhood from\nbirth and truly oppressed.\nI do not believe that a social class that is both a material and an immaterial beneficiary in an oppressive\nsystem can ever be classified as a victim of that system.\nVictimhood is relative \u2013 all humans could be seen as victims of capitalism \u2013 but given the immense power and\nadvantage that it gives the super-rich, they cannot be\nconsidered victims, as any victimhood they may claim is\nthoroughly and definitively outweighed by the material\nand immaterial benefits they enjoy through exploiting\nothers.\nThe same is true of patriarchy. Men are not its victims\nin the same way that those who own the means of production are not the victims of capitalism. The inability\nof men to express sadness through tears in front of their\npeers is relatively insignificant compared to the subjugation of their female counterparts, and therefore they\nshould not be described as victims of the same system\nthat allows them to enjoy the benefits of the exploitation\nof their sisters, mothers, and wives.\nNow, let\u2019s look at the fallacies which are often invoked\nwhen discussing the principally incomplete data. Quite\noften, when men\u2019s mental health is viewed as a form of\noppression, various statistics are invoked when arguing\nso \u2013 the male suicide rate being one of them. We could\nspend hours talking about reported statistics, yet mentions of women having higher rates of anxiety, depression and attempted suicide are met with the argument\nthat men\u2019s mental health issues are stigmatised, and so\nthe men\u2019s rates are under-reported \u2013 which, aside from\nbeing a symmetric argument, is frequently a disguise\nfor the thought process \u2018we believe the men\u2019s rates are\ntrue but the women must be exaggerating\u2019. What is never mentioned in this counterargument is that mental\nhealth issues are widely stigmatised in general \u2013 there\nis no reason why women somehow overcome this, while\nmen do not. To avoid a lengthy discussion about the\ntrustworthiness of universally underreported statistics,\nI will discuss the roots of the argument.\nA frequent argument is that men face social pressures to conceal their emotions to some substantial\ndegree. What is ignored is that women are forced into\nemotional suppression to an arguably more severe degree by not being able to express anger or pain in conventional ways, and being socialised to be submissive\nno matter how much they resist. The average woman\u2019s\nlife is almost guaranteed to include her being resigned\nto be a wife and being expected to provide the traditional\nunpaid services of a wife, being used by her partner for\nhousework, doing the emotional labor in her relationships with men, being sexually assaulted, being abused\nemotionally and in many cases physically or sexually by\nher husband, bearing the children and raising them (but\nnot being able to give them her name), and that is to list\nbut a few things which define the lives of women in the\nworld, which no one seems to notice.\nShe is stripped of her dignity, her right to self-deter\u2018How often do we see\nfeminists stand up for the\nhardships of men?\u2019\nMy answer is too often.\n\u201c\n\n"

These experiences are\nfar more damaging to women\u2019s mental health than what\nmen experience. I postulate that women\u2019s rates of suicidal thoughts as well as their rates of depression are higher\nthan men\u2019s \u2013 but their ingrained sense of immense responsibility to those around them including their children as they are forced to be the primary caregivers, and\ntheir socialisation to care more for others\u2019 wellbeing\nthan their own, lead to less women carrying out their\nintentions.\nMen do not face the same type or extent of such social\npressures. The argument that states men are oppressed\nby patriarchy due to the social pressures that make them\ncommit suicide and therefore are subjugated does not\nexplain why women, who generally lead harder lives\nand face more damaging experiences, both in severity\nand frequency, under a system which hates them, do not\nhave higher rates of suicide.\nFurthermore, it is important to explore how men and\nwomen exhibit depression. While men exhibit mental\nhealth issues in external ways, leading to violence and\nsubstance abuse, women, despite experiencing more\nintense effects, fail to exhibit such external symptoms\nand instead internalise their feelings. This is once again\ncaused by the fundamental denial of personhood to\nwomen and the socialisation of men. Men\u2019s violence or\nself-destruction as a response to anger is condoned and\nthe victims of these responses are ignored. This evidence\nis often ignored in conversation as the supporters of the\nproposed \u2018subjugation of men\u2019 refer to clinicians\u2019 biases against men and their emotions, but this again fails\nto consider that clinicians are far more biased against\nwomen. Women who have neurodevelopmental disorders go undiagnosed, women with physical conditions\ngo ignored, and women\u2019s pleas to doctors are frequently\ndismissed or attributed to mild anxiety or hormones.\nOne cannot argue that men as a social class are the\npredominant victims of emotional stifling. When we\nanalyse capitalism, which does alienate all people, we\nnever frame the super-rich as the victims, and when we\nanalyse white supremacy, which again separates and\ndivides people and stops them from enriching their understanding of cultures, we never frame white people as\nthe victims. Unfortunately, uniquely when analysing pa-triarchy, are we hellbent on framing men as victims too.\nMen\u2019s emotions may indeed be stifled to some extent\nunder patriarchy \u2013 those men who challenge me on my\nviewsassertthattheyfeeluncomfortablebeingemotion-ally open in front of their peers, specifically with sadness\nor disappointment. They also assert that to solve issues\naffecting predominantly women, like sexual abuse, we\nmust prioritise men and fix men\u2019s mental states first.\nTo this, I present two responses. Firstly, women\u2019s emotions are repressed to a larger extent as outlined above\nabout anger and frustration. When it comes to sadness,\nwomen are often regarded as hysterical, and their concerns are ignored, while men who cry publicly may be\nregarded as \u2018feminine\u2019, a word sometimes synonymous\nwith weakness. However, being emotional is something\nmen can use to their social advantage. Openly emotional\nmen are regarded as caring and kind \u2013 we even see this\nodd praise during political campaigns, such as Obama\u2019s\nreactions to national tragedies, which were at worst reported neutrally. The outcome of men being openly sad\nis at best praise, and at worst, mocking and some form\nof emotional repression. This worst-case scenario is not\neven comparable to the emotional repression of women,\nthe denial of their concerns by the doctors and the psy-chiatrists, the frequent way in which they are mocked by\nthose around them for \u2018hysteria\u2019, and their forced resignation to a life of subjugation.\nSecondly, men\u2019s violence against women is not borne\nfrom men\u2019s depression \u2013 it is borne from the dominance\nand submissiveness dynamic between men and wom-en. In the words of Catharine MacKinnon, it is the social requirements of heterosexuality that define gender,\nand this \u201cinstitutionalises male sexual dominance and\nfemale sexual submission\u201d. There is no reasonable case\nfor suggesting that stopping men\u2019s violence is contingent upon prioritising their allegedly more important\ndepression. Arguing that men rape because they are\ndepressed or because society doesn\u2019t give them enough\nsupport implies that there is no socialised violence in\nmen as a social class. We can easily ascertain this to be\nfalse by observing their behavior when interacting with\nwomen and with each other. As mentioned before, it\nis reported that men\u2019s mental health issues are also expressed far more violently than women\u2019s, and this implies that men are socialised to be violent. Otherwise, we\nwould be arguing that violence comes from depression\nitself, and that does not explain why women, who have\nhigher rates of depression, are not more violent.\nIn this piece, I have been careful not to assert that\nthe mental health of humans is not a societal issue, but\nit cannot be used to frame men as victims of patriarchy\nin any reasonable way. Arguments on this topic, but\nthrough summarising some points I conclude that the\ndiscussions surrounding mental health issues in which\nmen are frequently considered victims of patriarchy do\nnot stand up to even the brief analysis I have been able\nto give. Continuing to frame men as patriarchy\u2019s victims\nand centering them in these discussions and policies is\nfrankly a disservice to the women of the world.\nThis fundamental denial of\nher personhood demands\nemotional repression\n\u201c\nhalfpoint\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n24 | arts 8 March 2024\nI\nf I were to ask you what are the first\nplays that come to mind when I say\n\u201cShakespeare\u201d, you would probably\nsay Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, or even\nHamlet. Perhaps these are his most notable works. Or perhaps this is what years\nof High School Literature have trained us\nto regurgitate. Either way, you would be\nhard pressed to find someone answering\nwith Henry IV parts 1 and 2. They are not\nthe most memorable of titles nor is their\nsubject the most notable of Royal Henries. Within Shakespeare\u2019s oeuvre, both\nworks are best remembered as part of a\ntetralogy known as the Henriad, wherein\ncritically, the whole is often considered\ngreater than the sum of its parts.\nTo not alienate modern audiences,\nwriter director Robert Icke has combined\nboth parts into a single play, retitled, Player Kings, which had its opening night\nlast Friday at the New Wimbledon Theatre. The new title implies a shift away\nfrom the political and historical aspects\nof the original plays, instead focusing on\nthe \u2018players\u2019, or actors, responsible for\nbringing the characters to life. The setting has similarly been updated to a modern one. Negotiations are now done over\ntelephone; armour has been swapped for\nmilitary fatigues and swords have been\ntraded for handguns, although talk of beheadings have survived into Icke\u2019s script.\nRichard Coyle (Fantastic Beasts: The\nSecrets of Dumbledore) plays the once\ntitular King Henry IV. Despite the peripheral role, his presence is always felt. Coyle\nplays a Henry IV at war with his own con-victions. He is torn between maintaining\nstability and waging war. He is torn between his ambitions as king and the guilt\nof usurping his cousin Richard II. Above\nall, he is torn between his disappointment in Prince Hal\u2019s wayward behaviour\nand his hopes for his son\u2019s future as a\nworthy successor. Coyle best captures the\ncharacter\u2019s inner turmoil when he breaks\nthe fourth fall to provide a sombre delivery of the play\u2019s most iconic line, \u201cUneasy\nlies the head that wears the crown\u201d.\nUneasy is an understatement when\nheir-apparent Hal is mingling with the\nlikes of Sir John Falstaff in the seedy\nEastchap Tavern. Toheeb Jimoh (The\nFrench Dispatch) plays a Hal fighting his\nown war. He is torn between his duties\nas successor and his loyalty to drunken\nfriends. One of whom is Falstaff, an aging\nknight in constant need of inebriation.\nHe is a humorous but comforting sight\nfor Hal when away from the royal court\n\u2014 a court jester in Hal\u2019s own court of out-casts.\nPlaying Falstaff is the play\u2019s headliner,\nSir Ian McKellen. While McKellen will be\nrecognised by most as Gandalf from Lord\nof the Rings, he was perhaps best known\nin his early days as a champion of thea-tre. He is no stranger to Shakespeare. His\nexperience as a leading man in Shakespearean theatre has progressed with\nage, going from princes to kings, from\nHamlet to Lear. Now, at the golden age\nof 84, McKellen\u2019s role as Falstaff marks a\nmodest step away from the spotlight.\nHis career on stage appears to have\nreached its canonical tail, playing an\naging knight who is neither eponymous\nnor the protagonist, but rather, a comic\nrelief. Even if Falstaff is a man past his\nprime, McKellen proves that he is still\nin it. He plays the aging knight with sin-cerity, and yet, with the same verve and\ncharisma of a newfound talent. McKellen\nflexes his comedic chops, proving that\nhe can do more than play tragic heroes.\nThat said, McKellen\u2019s Falstaff is not without nuance.\nWhile most of the source material\nis preserved word for word, Jimoh and\nMcKellens\u2019 delivery of Shakespeare\u2019s\nwriting paint a pivoted portrait of Hal\nand Falstaff\u2019s relationship. In Part 1, Hal\nand Falstaff are traditionally portrayed as\nhaving a friendly relationship. However,\nPlayer Kings interprets their relationship\nas one that has eroded with time and\nsoon to reach its breaking point. This is\na Hal that appears disillusioned with Falstaff\u2019s boisterous demeanour.\nOne scene that sticks out is from Part\n1, set in the Eastchap tavern. Hal and Falstaff take turns role playing the King and\nhis advisor, in a mocking exchange. It is a\nsceneplayedforlaughs,andMcKellengot\nmany out of the audience, including my-self. Things takes a heated turn when Hal\ntakes the place of his father. Traditionally, the insults Hal direct at Falstaff in the\nKing\u2019s voice are made in jest, with irony\nhelping to soften the blows and keep the\ntone of the scene light. The scene is also\nmeant to foreshadow Hal\u2019s ultimate betrayal and abandonment of Falstaff and\nhis friends, as his sarcastic remarks mask\nreservations about their character.\nHowever, Jimoh does not play a textbook Hal. He takes words that could have\nbeen read as playful jabs and sharpens\nthem into daggers, hurling them with resentment to attack Falstaff\u2019s appearance\nand demeanour. Though the underlying\ntension is meant to be subtle, Icke\u2019s direction brings Hal\u2019s deep-seated resentment\nto the forefront. It makes you wonder\nhow many lies Falstaff told to push the\nyoung Prince to such an edge. McKellen\ndrops Falstaff\u2019s joyful demeanour as Hal\u2019s\ntirade goes on, and for a moment I got the\nsense that he saw Hal\u2019s underlying feelings peek through. It makes Hal\u2019s eventual turn all the clearer.\nWith this alteration, Icke re-contex-tualises a few of Hal\u2019s actions. Take his\nmasked robbery of Falstaff after one of\nhis heists for example. Hal\u2019s eventual\nreveal to everyone in the tavern that Falstaff had lied about how he got the money stolen can no longer be interpreted as\na practical joke, but rather as an expos\u00e9\non Falstaff\u2019s compulsive lying.\nAlthough, in sticking to the script,\nthis interpretation takes away from other\ncanonical events. Hal\u2019s endorsement of\nFalstaff in the latter half of Part 1 to select the conscripts for his platoon makes\nless sense knowing his distrust. Furthermore, Falstaff\u2019s supposed death, in what\nPlayer Kings\nArtsWriter\u0003\nCHARLIE CHUA\nA review of Robert Icke\u2019s retelling of\n\u2018The Henriad\u2019\nCurtain Call Charlie Chua\n\n"

Ex-employees\nare notoriously tight lipped but rumour\nhave suggested that the office floor\nis covered in earth and rocks and the\nsprinklers are always turned on in\norder to simulate a drizzly walk up in\nthe Lake District, all the better to match\nthe company uniform of high-tech\nwalking shoes and Gore-tex waterproof\noverwear.\nA College employee, who was present\nat the meeting, described how the\natmosphere \u2018[grew] increasingly tense\u2019\nas the Kreative design group watched the\nhapless Imperial pitch team fumble with\ntheirlaptops.\u201cTheyhadsomanyeyebrow\npiercings they would clang every time\nthey frowned,\u201d he told NegaFelix, \u201cwhich\nmade it impossible to focus.\u201d\nA student petition demanding that\nthe College revert to its old branding\nhas gained 37 signatures, the highest\nparticipation in student politics at\nImperial since the 2003 march in support\nof the Iraq War.\nSenior College staff have, however,\nrebuffed any suggestion that the\nmoney spent on the rebrand may not\nhave been value for money. Senior\nVice Provost for Boondoggles, Geila\nLuerra, told NegaFelix that the rebrand\nwas necessary to cement Imperial\u2019s\ninternational reputation. She told our\nreporter that \u201cIf Imperial is going to\nbe known as an international centre\nof technical excellence, we have to\ndemonstrate that all of our money\nis being spent on research and not\nwasted on marketing or administrative\nnonsense. Hiring SuCK (for an\nestimated fee of \u00a33.4 million) ensured\nthat our branding would look as\namateurish as possible and convey that\nimage to the world.\u201d\nCATNIP\nImperial College rebranding colour\ninspired by \u2018blue screen of death\u2019\nLIBRA SCORPIO SAGITTARIUS CAPRICORN AQUARIUS PISCES\nARIES TAURUS GEMINI CANCER LEO VIRGO\nThis week you set your\nHinge radius to 20\nmeters and make eye\ncontact as you press X\nThis week the older\nboyfriend you met in\nfresher\u2019s week reacts badly\nto Facebook being down\nThis week the Easter\nholidays offer you a\nchance to scroll through\nTikTok in a different bed\nThis week your rent is\npaid late resulting in a\nstern email from Maria\nPatzechnetzskychis the\nestate agent\nThis week you get so lazy\nyou start skipping club\nnights as well as lectures\nby telling yourself you will\ncatch up later\nThis week the lack of\nfibre in your diet is giving\nyou constipation and a\nBBL\nThis week it\u2019s nothing\nthat a mortis and tenon\nwon\u2019t fix\nThis week you start\npracticing your Northern\naccent again for when\nyou go back home\nThis week the warming\nweather means that it is\nno longer too expensive\nto turn on the heating\nThis week the worst\nperson you have ever met\nasks you to follow their\ncampaign page\nThis week you are the\nirritating member of the\nfriendship group everybody\nwishes would stop showing\nup\nThis week it has\nbecome mathematically\nimpossible for you to get\na first\nArts Correspondent\nWILLIAM MCGONAGALL\n\n"

First of all, I must right a truly heinous wrong in the cryptic crossword,\nin which I referred to Justin Trudeau as the Canadian President, rather than\nPrime Minister. I hope our Canadian readers will forgive this ghastly error.\nSecondly, there was a mistake in the cryptogram where the letter P was cy-phered both as an L and a J. Well done to the many people who solved the\npuzzle despite this, and many thanks to Louise Parchson for pointing the\nmistake out to us.\nThis week has seen Aspenlads race ahead into first place with a magnificent 70 points! A huge congratulations to them, and to our many newcomers\nto the leaderboard. The scores will reset next term, so don't think there's not\na chance to catch up!\nFinally, I'd like to thank my personal friend Josh Newson for kindly contributing some clues to the cryptic crossword.

Instead of having\ncandidates gather in the Union\nBuilding to address an empty\nroom, we brought them into IC\nRadio\u2019s recording studio. It was a\nmuch cosier setting, in which we\nwere able to interview candidates\nindividually, and give them an\nopportunity to expand upon their\nmanifestos \u2013 something that the\nprevious format did not allow.\nThere were a few hiccups along\nthe way (the live recording cut out,\nthe schedule didn\u2019t quite work as\nplanned, and there definitely wasn\u2019t\nsufficient promotion of the event), but\nwe learned a lot that will inform plans\nfor next year.\nCertainly,candidatesseemedmore\nat ease, giving them more opportunity\nto answer the challenging questions\nwe wanted to ask them about their\nplans.\nA debate segment proved tough for\nthose involved, but we are grateful to\nUnion President candidates Chelsea\nStubbs and Camille Boutrolle for\ntheir spirit in agreeing to participate.\nAny serious contender for Union\nPresident should have engaged with\nthe event.\nBut really, this editorial is not\nabout the candidates themselves. It\nis about voting, and why you should\ndo it.\nImperial\u2019s community is\nremarkably diverse \u2013 each student\nfaces a different set of challenges,\nand deserves for those challenges to\nbe voiced to senior management and\naddressed.\nThe student union is one avenue\nfor this. Its Officer Trustees and\nrepresentation networks are avenues\nthrough which change can be\nbrought about. The Union can work\nwith Imperial\u2019s leadership to build a\nuniversity experience that addresses\nyour needs.\nIf the College gets things wrong\nor doesn\u2019t listen to you, Union\nrepresentatives can lobby for change\nand escalate your concerns to senior\ndecision-makers. They can support\nyou through your difficulties and\nprovide you with advice when you\nneed it.\nBut all this relies on you voting\nconsistently and in high numbers.\nIf you want more support during\nthe cost-of-living crisis, want the\nCollege to be taken to task for its\nfailure to address the heating issues\non campus, or if you want the logo\nto change, then you should vote for\nstudent representatives who care\nabout these things.\nAnd if you don\u2019t think the\ncandidates this year are up to\nscratch, then you should consider\nputting your name in the hat next\nyear.\nA high turnout would give the\nUnion itself greater legitimacy \u2013 a\nmandate to lobby on your behalf\nbecause it would be able to claim\nmore credibly to represent you.\nAnd encouraged by the fact that\ntheir work would be taken seriously,\nwe\u2019d see a better field of candidates.\nThings might not improve\ndramatically in a single year, but\nif everybody voted, then over the\ncourse of a few years \u2013 the length of\na university degree even \u2013 we would\nsee real change.\nIndeed, there has already been\nchange: part of the reason the\nuniversity has started to engage on\nissues of sustainability is because\nyou have voted in candidates who\ncare about this issue.\nBut right now, Union elections\nare being decided by a coterie of\nvocal, passionate students who\nknow all of the above, and exercise\ntheir votes.\nSo please vote in next week\u2019s\nleadership elections. You don\u2019t have\nto vote for every single position out\nthere, but at least do so for the paid\nroles (Officer Trustees) and the ones\nthat could affect your experience at\nImperial.\nIt\u2019s very simple, scan the QR code\nbelow, and sign in with your College\ndetails. For each position, find the\nindividuals you\u2019d like to vote for and\nrank those candidates according to\nyour preferences. If you don\u2019t think\nany of the candidates are suitable,\nvote to re-open nominations (RON).\nVote here!\nLetter to the editor:\nCouncil Chair\nquotes Mao Zedong\nDear Felix,\nIn the recent President\u2019s address of Imperial\u2019s\nnew strategy, John Allan (Chair of Council) quoted\nMao Zedong, the dictator of the Chinese communist\nrevolution. This is highly insensitive and demonstrates\nsevere ignorance to the atrocious, blood-laden history\nof Mao Zedong\u2019s reign during the 1900s, and extends to\nthe human rights abuses of today\u2019s CCP. Allan says: \u201cas\nChairman Mao once said ..., \u2018the journey of a thousand\nmiles begins with a single step\u2019\u201d\n. The footage can be\nfound at minute 16:00 of the President\u2019s Address:\nhttps://youtu.be/bq3Fso5Lc70?t=950 .\nJohn Allan must understand the brutal history\nbehind Mao Zedong\u2019s reign. Tens of millions of civilians\nand soldiers were killed or starved during the years of\nthe revolution as a consequence of Mao\u2019s authoritarian\npolicies. Between the likes of Mao, Stalin and Hitler,\npeople can\u2019t decide on the most brutal dictator. But Mr\nAllan can decide that he likes a quote by one of these\nmass murderers.\nPerhaps Mr Allan made an honest, ignorant\nmistake, but he must be pressed on his comments.\nFurthermore, an institution like Imperial must be\naware of how it chooses to represent its position on\nhistorically significant and sensitive topics.\nI hope you agree that nobody should get away\nlightly with this kind of ignorance. I am emailing you,\nthe Felix team, as you are the best outlet to inform the\nCollege community about this.\nCouncil Chair's\nreply\nHi Felix,\nI have used the phrase that is complained of many\ntimes over many years.\nNo one has ever complained before. The intention\nwas simply to make it clear that the implementation of\nthe new strategy will take many years but we need to\nget started.\nAfter my very short speech I was congratulated by a\nfair number of people either in person or by email.\nHowever having been made aware that someone\nwas offended by my remarks I will find an alternative\nexpression in the future.\nBest wishes,\nJohn Allan\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n26 | PHOTOGRAPHY 8 march 2024\nP\nurple\u2019 might at first seem a mundane theme when coming after abstract concepts such as \u2018limerence\u2019\nand \u2018sonder\u2019, but one realises in looking\nfor photos to submit to this theme that\nthe colour purple is truly an elusive one.\nIt is most often seen in flowers and sun-sets, and in artificial lights used for concerts or exhibitions. We also see purple\nin fashion and in other human designs,\nthough still rarely. More often than not,\nan image that appears purple is actually\na combination of blues, reds, and pinks:\na trick of the light. It makes sense then\nthat purple can stand for so much: such\na wide range of emotions and concepts.\nIt holds a certain power in its elusive-ness, often used to represent royalty or\nwealth, wisdom, and creativity, but also\njealousy or \u2018evil\u2019. In film, it can be used to\nevoke a sense of unease or call to mind\nthe supernatural. In space and the stars,\npurple appears to occur naturally from\nafar, and yet this is something intangible\nto us, beyond our reach. In nature, purple\noften signifies something toxic and dan-gerous.\nThe evasiveness of purple isn\u2019t just to\ndo with its real rarity, but is also an actual phenomenon in digital photography,\neven extending to its use (or lack thereof)\nin film. Digital sensors often have trouble\npicking up the colour purple, owing to its\nblue and red components being on opposite ends of the digital colour spectrum.\nThis makes it exceedingly hard to capture what the eyes see in reality, and so\nphotographers who are able to do this \u2013\nlike the ones displayed here \u2013 have a gift.\nIt\u2019s also possible to do this in post-pro-duction, while editing your picture. Use\nthe \u2018Hue\u2019 slider (usually under HSL or a\nsimilar abbreviation) to shift your colours away from whatever background you\nhave and towards purple. For example, if\nyour background contains a lot of green,\nuse the \u2018blue hue\u2019 slider, or if your image\ncontains lots of red, use the \u2018purple hue\u2019\nslider. Remember not to overdo it! You\ndon\u2019t want your colours to look unnatural,\nand you don\u2019t want to introduce too much\nchromatic aberration to the picture (col-our distortion, also called fringing, that\nusually appears in a purplish hue at the\nedges of subjects in your image).\nThis comes back to one of our greatest strengths; recreating or amplifying\nwhat occurs in nature \u2013 we make dyes\nand paints from the purples we observe\nin flower petals and minerals, and we figured out that the mixture of red and\nblue creates this coveted colour. It is no\nsurprise, then, that purple is sometimes\ntaken as the ultimate symbol of moderni-ty. This might bring to mind the vibrant\ncolour palette of synthetic dyes and neon\nlights, designed to draw the eye and exude luxury and mystique.\nWe might also disagree on what actually appears purple \u2013 the strong characters of its neighbouring colours can\neasily dominate an image, leading individual perception to play a larger role\nin interpretation. The winning photo for\nthis week\u2019s theme, Mauvy Agility, is viv-idly, almost undoubtedly purple, and yet\nwe could easily question whether parts of\nthis are still just a trick of the light \u2013 the\nreflection of purple on silver or blue se-quins.\nIt is hard to show the powerful nature\nof a single colour without overpowering\nthe image, but this week\u2019s submissions\ndid so fantastically: Dhanvanth has captured a dynamic movement that complements the colour\u2019s own personality, while\nJack and Pawida have framed their respective environments in a purple haze.\nPurple\nPHOTOGRAPHY\nPhotographyWriter\nZANNA BUCKLAND\nA monochromatic theme that is\nneither mundane nor simple.\nMauvy Agility Dhanvanth Srinivasan\nTake my heart Pawida\nStreaks Jack Xie\n\n"

Eliott had us stretch, lock eyes with a random person, and finally all stand\nin a circle holding a piece of string. As I write this, I am still wearing my bit of the string\naround my wrist.\nThe other opportunity for networking was lunch, featuring vegetarian and vegan\nfood.

The Grantham Institute is Imperial\u2019s premier climate research collective. At the fair, they\npromoted plant-based milk, and other\ninitiatives individuals can take to fight\nclimate change. Move Imperial handed out high-visibility jackets and other\ntools for cyclists to stay safe in London.\nGreen Impact was present to promote its\nnew partnership with Imperial, where\nresearch groups can compete to have the\nmost sustainable operations.\nThe coveted Sherfield Building spots\nwere a subject of envy among those in\nMetric \u2013 especially from those running\nthe repair workshop, who had been in\nthe Sherfield Building in previous years,\nand Plant-Based Universities (PBU), who\nhad been told they had a space in the\nSherfield Building only to have arrangements changed last minute. The event\nwas supposedly publicised but the total\nattendance in Metric was, generously, 10\npeople. I was at the Plant-Based Universities stall for four hours and saw maybe\none person. The unexpectedly low traffic caused frustration among the people\nworking the stands, who began packing\nup hours before the event was supposed\nto end. One activist on the day said \u201cthis\nis absolute sh*t\u201d before packing up their\nstand early and leaving.\nThe four stalls which were relegated to\nMetric were PBU, Environmental Society,\nStudents Organising for Sustainability\n(SOS), and a Repair & Upcycling work-shop. For more information about getting involved, check page 20.\nAt the repair workshop, I had the opportunity to repair several holes in my\nwaterproof jacket \u2013 the design of which\nthey called \u201cjust stupid\u201d \u2013 while sitting at\nthe PBU table.\nAll the stalls in Metric addressed critical areas where behaviour change is\nneeded \u2013 exactly what one could hope\nto achieve at a better-placed stand. PBU\nencourages eating more plants, which is\nthe most significant behavioural change\nwe can make to reduce our emissions\naccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Research and projects were showcased from across\nthe participating universities on topics including the psychology behind fast fashion,\npower dynamics in UK agriculture, and digital sustainability.\nPosters of sustainability research from the partner universities were displayed all\nday at the back of the Great Hall, sparking conversations at the networking after-wards. During the closing remarks, awards were presented for the best posters submitted beforehand.\nThe conference focused on mitigating climate change, with a distinct lack of talks\non adapting to its effects.

After watching Player Kings,\nI am reminded of how Shakespeare\u2019s writing still rings true even after 500 years.\nIf all of this, besides having Sir Ian McKellen\u2019s name on the tin, has convinced you\nthat this latest adaptation of Henry IV is\nworth your time, there are a few more factors to consider before putting your money\ndown.\nThe play lasts four hours, including an\nintermission and a shorter \u2018pause\u2019 between\nthe second and third act. For anyone who\nfrequents the theatre, that is nearly double\nwhat most plays and musicals are offering\nin terms of runtime. Understandably, this\ncan make a supposed enjoyable evening at\nthe theatre feel like a marathon. As is often\nthe case with Shakespeare, there are times\nit can feel that way. Just keep in mind that\nyou are getting two plays for the price of\none.\nAnd then there\u2019s the issue of visibility.\nThroughout the performance, an opaque\nscreen moves vertically like a curtain. It\ndoubles as a variable aperture, revealing or\nconcealing stage space depending on what\nthe scene requires. Limiting the audiences\u2019\nfield of view helped to focus our attention\nto action in the foreground, or even shape\nemotive forces. For instance, the screen can\nbe lowered to create a narrower opening to\nheighten the tension for dramatic scenes.\nConversely, it can be raised for comedic ef-fect. For example, a scene featuring Falstaff\nfeigning his death has the screen slowly\nlower like a curtain closing, before abruptly\nretracting as he springs to life.\nHowever, the unintended consequence is\nrestricted visibility the higher you are seat-ed. I was seated in the front row of the Upper Circle (Third level) and even then, there\nwere numerous times I found myself staring at the actors\u2019 legs mid-scene, through\nthe sliver of stage left by the lowered screen.\nI hate to imagine what those seated at the\nback were left with, if at all. The worst of\ntimes was when the screen moved up partially to reveal something shocking that\nonly those seated in the Stalls and Grand\nCircle (Second level) could see. Granted, my\nseat did come with a restricted view warning upon purchase, but there is no indication the extent to which your view will be\nobstructed. Your mileage will also vary depending on the theatre you watch this in,\nseeing as it will be touring at two other ven-ues. It is not enough to ruin the experience\nbut something to keep in mind when purchasing tickets at a more affordable price.\nPlayer Kings is running its previews from\n1-9 March at the New Wimbledon Theatre\nbefore moving to the Opera House in Manchester from 14-23 March. It will finally\nlanding closer to home at the No\u00ebl Coward\nTheatre in the West End for its final run\nfrom 1 April to 22 June.\nCast Rehearsals Manuel Harlan\nSir Ian McKellen in rehersals Manuel Harlan\n\n"

These regions are home to some of the happiest \u2013 the most vital\n\u2013 and contrary to what one would expect, oldest people\nin the world. National Geographic Fellow Dan Buettner,\nwho travelled to each of these regions, has deciphered\nthe mystery of the longevity of these people. Here at\nFelix,weidentifiedthefollowinglifestylechoicesbacked\nby scientific evidence.\n1: Moving naturally\nThe perils of a sedentary lifestyle in the urban world\nhave been voiced by countless studies and surveys\nworldwide. Sedentary behavior, such as walking less\nthan 4,000 steps a day, reduces the metabolic benefits of\nacute exercise concentrated at specific times in the day.\nOccasional activity, such as walking to the grocers in the\nevening, taking the stairs, or avoiding motor transport\nfor cycling/walking has shown to have more metabolic\nbenefits and reduce post meal insulin levels. Through\ntheir trips across the blue zones, Buettner and his team\ndiscovered that people in blue zones were nudged into\nmoving about every 20 minutes. Gardening was a popular past time activity, people kneaded their own bread,\nand appliances were largely missing from everyday life.\nGoing out \u2013 whether to school, a restaurant, or a friend\u2019s\nhouse \u2013 was mostly on foot. In essence, movement was\nengineered into their daily lives, which has been shown\nto have benefits in terms of increased and more efficient\nmetabolism.\n2: The happiness of happy hour\nDespite the perception of alcohol being detrimental to\nour health, moderated consumption of wine has its own\nhealth benefits. It is rich in antioxidants, is known to\nlower certain kinds of cholesterol and certain studies\neven go as far as to say that red wine plays a role in preventing coronary heart disease. Not only do centenarians in blue zones indulge in moderate consumption of\nthe beverage, but they always do so in a social context\naround friends and family. In these areas, drinking is\nemphasized less than the socialising and sense of community that is built through the evening get togethers\nwith food and a good glass of wine. The social interactions that come with these happy hour get togethers are\nknown to increase emotional well-being and decrease\nstress \u2013 a guaranteed way of boosting life expectancy.\n3: Moderated diets and the 80% rule\nMoving to a plant-based diet is a trend that Buettner and\nhis team observed across all blue zones they traveled to.\nLinking back to gardening as a hobby that incorporated\nphysical exercise into people\u2019s lives, also ensured they\nhad fresh produce to eat and moved them away from\nmeat to fresh vegetables. Their need for dietary components such as proteins was ensured through the abundance of beans in their diets \u2013 black, soy, fava and lentils.\nThese are a part of diets of communities all across the\nworld but their benefits in terms of their high protein\ncontent are mostly ignored. Hand in hand with this,\npeople in Okinawa, Japan also followed what they call\nthe 80% rule. By stopping to eat when their stomachs\nwere 80% full, or when they just started feeling full, they\nprevented eating more than what their bodies required\nand hence obesity rates in blue zones were found to be\nmuch lower \u2013 another contributor to their longevity.\n4: Purpose, family and friends\nLongevity in the blue zones can be explained by\nsimple science \u2013 eat less, eat more protein and exercise\nmore. These are things everyone has heard and ample\nstudies have shown the benefits of. Blue zones introduced a new dimension into explaining longevity. Centenarians in these areas emphasise the psychological\nbenefits of having a purpose in one\u2019s life. Captured in\nthe Japanese concept of Ikigai, knowing why you wake\nup in the morning and having a clear purpose in life can\nhelp. According to a published study, this adds seven\nyears to an average person\u2019s life expectancy. Buettner\nand his team discovered that staying with family and\nkeeping your loved ones close by have also been shown\nto increase emotional well-being and feeling of security in the elderly. A study, Aging Alone in America, reported that 100 years ago, 70% of widows and widowers\nlived with their families; this has now dropped to 30%.\nIn essence, eating healthy, eating the right food, moving more often and finding time for friends and family\nare the simple paths to a healthier, longer and more fulfilling life. As a centenarian in Greece told Buettner, the\nbest kind of tea to drink, is wine.\nLive until 100?

Binary, whilst being\nan essential part of the foundation of computing, is\nnot used in modern day software development. Assembly code, a low-level code slightly more readable\nthan binary, does still have some applications. For\ninstance, in the financial services industry, assembly\ncode is used for a specialised trading technique: arbi-trage trading.\nArbitrage is where traders will find small pricing discrepancies between different stock exchanges and buy\nthe cheaper stock to immediately sell to the exchange\nbiding at a higher price. For example, if the London\nStock Exchange Group (LSEG) lists Microsoft shares at\na price of \u00a3400.52 and EURONEXT has them listed for\n\u00a3400.51, traders can buy from the EURONEXT and sell\nto LSEG for a profit. Of course, no exchange wants to\nbe taken advantage of in this way and when mistakes\nsuch as this occur, it usually gets rectified in a matter of\nmilliseconds. This means that in order to execute the\ntrade on the time it cannot be performed manually, it\nmust happen automatically.\nFine-tuned computers which are regulated down to\nthe microsecond are the ones executing these trades.\nTrading desks will even go as far as buying computer spaces as close to the exchange\u2019s central computers\nas possible to receive pricing updates in as little time\nas possible. This ensures that once an inconsistency is\nidentified, lightning-fast trade execution code comes\ninto play.\nTraders cannot use higher level languages to write\nthe code which will buy and sell the discrepant shares.\nHigher level languages are often compiled or interpreted into machine code through an intermediary\nlanguage, which slows the execution speed down.\nFurtherfunctionsofhigher-levelcodinglanguagessuch\nas range checks, which validate the input data, slow the\ncode down even further. As a result, it is much more\nefficient to use a code that can directly be translated\ninto machine language. However, assembly language\nis not only difficult to understand, but most coders\nwould also write inefficient scripts and end up costing\nthe trading desk money. There is evidently a constant\npush and pull between the trading desks trying to gain\nthe system and the stock exchanges trying to consolidate stock prices.\nOf course, with so many specificities, arbitrage trading is a very complicated and tech-heavy industry.\nSo how does it look like in other areas of the financial\nservices sector? Surprisingly, despite the forefront of coding used in some areas, in others, many\nthings are still done manually. In the governance\nindustry, which helps stockholders elect appointed\npositions in the companies they are invested in, much of\nthe work is still done by post and mail. In the accounts\nreconciliation sector, which helps financial institutions\nprepare statements for regulators, many are still relying\non Excel. Many major financial institutions are relying\non softwares that are decades old for portfolio management systems, custody software, accounting purposes,\netc.\nSo why is it that in the same industry, such specific\nhigh-tuned code is used for a minute task while so much\nof the rest of the industry is lagging? How does it look in\nother industries? This suggests that perhaps it is time to\ninvest more into computer literacy. With the majority of\npeople only being introduced to coding at a tech-focused\nuniversity,itisnowonderthefinancialsectorisrelyingon\noutdated,manualprocessesfortasksthatcouldeasilybe\nautomated\u2026\nDoes low-level coding still have a\nplace in stock market analysis?\nSCIENCE\nIn this week\u2019s column,\nYasmine explores the\nuses of low-level coding\nin the financial sector.\nGraphic representation of financial market data.

But she\nexpressed dismay that most tabloids and\njournals chose to focus on the fact that\nPrincess Kate did not attend, rather than\nthe topic of mental health itself.\nShe said that Princess Beatrice \u2013\ndiagnosed with dyslexia in her early days\nof schooling \u2013 was willing to \u201clisten and\nunderstand\u201d during the event, sharing her\nmental health experiences and fostering\nan environment in which students felt\ncomfortable sharing their own.\nFreccero has helped develop Imperial\u2019s\nMental Health and Wellbeing Strategy\nin her capacity as ICU Mental Health\nOfficer. The strategy outlines Imperial\u2019s\n\u2018goals for creating an inclusive, respectful\nand compassionate environment that\nsupports students and staff in their work\nand study\u2019, according to the College\nWebsite.\nImperial is currently working towards\nthe University Mental Health Award,\ncreated by Student Minds. Award winners\nare recognised for their demonstrated\n\u2018excellent approaches to student and staff\nmental health\u2019.\nFreccero says that her personal lived\nexperience is something many students\nat Imperial can relate to, and is the origin\nof her motivation to strive towards\nimproving college-wide mental health\nand wellbeing.\nShe describes her work helping student\nmental health as ICU Mental Health\nOfficer as her \u201cpurpose\u201d.\nShe completed an undergraduate\ndegree in biomedical sciences at UCL,\nbefore pursuing one Master\u2019s degree\nin neuroscience and a second in public\nhealth. After graduating in October, she\nstarted her PhD.\nFreccero took a year out of her\nundergraduate studies, and says she was\n\u201cclosetogivingup\u201d\u2013indeed,thosearound\nher that she should do so.\nComing from Italy, she experienced\nimposter syndrome. Imperial says that\nimposter syndrome \u2013 \u201ca belief that you\ndon\u2019t deserve the achievements you\nhave accomplished\u201d \u2013 is common among\nstudents at prestigious universities such\nas Imperial.\nFreccero was diagnosed with bipolar\ndisorder, and the mental health\ndifficulties that she experienced impacted\nher studies. At UCL, it was a personal tutor\nwho encouraged her to keep going and\nbelieved in her.\nAt Imperial, she recalls that a professor\ntold her to drop out, but again, a personal\ntutor encouraged her and believed in\nher. She persevered and was awarded\na first class in her Master\u2019s degree.\nSince then, she has gone on to achieve\ntwo distinctions and the prestigious\nPresident\u2019s scholarship for her PhD.\nThis year is Freccero\u2019s second as ICU\nMental Health Officer, and she has spent\nher time, raising awareness about mental\nhealth, developing Imperial\u2019s strategy\non the subject, and running campaigns\nto \u201creduce stigma\u201d around it. She says\nthat mental health is often overlooked\nat the College, explaining that the main\ngoal here is to \u201cstrive for excellence\u201d. Her\nmission,shesays,hasbeentochangethat.\nShe feels that \u201call it takes is one person\u201d\nto believe in you, and that her story is\ntestament to that.\nAglaia Freccero, Imperial College Union's Mental\nHealth Officer.

If you want your brand to do well,\nyou want a simple, easy to visualise logo that\nstands out on a sign and sticks with people even after a\nquick look. However, while simplicity is a helpful guideline for a logo design, it shouldn\u2019t be the only factor we\nconsider. A good logo is also one that is iconic, unique,\nand lets the consumer know what it actually is; communication is key. For example, the logo of the Walt Disney\ncorporation is not the simplest in the world (it is quite\nliterally Walt Disney\u2019s signature rendered in typeface)\nbut it is instantly recognisable and iconic proving that\nless is not necessarily more.\nIn a bold, controversial, and quite frankly stupid\nmove, Imperial has decided that it was time for an unnecessary rebrand. The college\u2019s own website says that\nthe rebrand will \u201ctell our story with even greater clarity,\nconfidence and impact.\u201d One must first ask how Imperial College will attempt to tell its story with clarity now\nthat it proclaims itself with a single adjective of \u2018Imperial\u2019.\nThe actual design aspect of the shocking rebrand has\nbeen done by the company \u2018Pentagram\u2019 whose suite of\nwhite, male, tieless suit-shirted non-jobs are quids-in\nfor coming up with the revolutionary idea of changing\nthe blue to\u2026get this\u2026a worse shade of blue, and having\nthe name \u2018Imperial\u2019 rendered in a rather chunky sans\nserif. Imperial College also felt the need to make an in-clusivity consultancy privy to its design which - judging\nfrom the collective disapproval from the student body -means it did a good job at making all students equal in\ntheir hatred for the rebrand.\nWhere did it go wrong then, how can we address this,\nand could a five-year-old do a better job? To answer this\none needs to do an old-fashioned compare and con-trast. Imperial\u2019s now old logo featured the College\u2019s full\nname in both Imperial Blue and it\u2019s lighter counterpart\nflanked by the college crest. The communications logo\nfeatured the same blue colour scheme but with a bold\nwhite \u2018I\u2019. Blue and white is an age old combo (as old as\nthe earth in fact as clouds are white and the sky is blue),\nand it remains a pleasing combo. Off white colours are\nalso very trendy in design circles as they allow one to\nmatch many off whites with different undertones (beig-es and creams) which allows one much greater colour\ndiversity and creativity with the design.\nNow let\u2019s look at the new logo: It has removed any\nand all recognisable identifiers choosing instead to remain as \u2018Imperial\u2019 and all colour schemes showcased\nattempt to cause great distress to the viewer by choosing contrasting colour schemes: blue with green, green\nand pink, blue and orange etc. The font is a rather squat\nsans serif lacking in any character, and the accessories\n(lanyards, keycards etc) look more like a finance internship merchandise than college property. Such colour\nschemes, merchandising, and showcasing are not foreign to us however, we see corporations like apple, google and facebook use such minimalistic brands all the\ntime in their publications and chose to showcase their\ndesigns with an art style known as \u2018Corporate Memphis\u2019\nwhich incorporates bold, contrasting colour schemes\nand exaggerated art styles. What\u2019s gone wrong then, is\nthat Imperial has disregarded its collegiate identity and\nhistory dating back to 1909 in favour of imitating the\nbig tech conglomerates with which it hopes to compete\nor do business with, and cares more about its image on\nbusiness plans and contracts rather than on its students\u2019\ndegree certificates.\nHow can we address this? Currently there are many\npetitions online regarding the boycott for this rebrand\nhowever one fears it may be too late. Imperial swooped\nin like a thief in the night to quickly replace all it\u2019s sign\nposts and logos before anyone could raise a hand in pro-test. The damage has been done and it may be irrepara-ble. However, we should continue to protest such things\nas best we can, Imperial College has now built a reputation of commissioning art and designs that no-one\nasked for that overpaid management-types thought was\n\u2018pretty neat\u2019 such as ALERT and the still-in-the-works\ngod-awful Blackett mural. Should the college continue\nto promote shockingly terrible designs, they may find\ntheir hallowed student satisfaction score go through the\nfloor?\nAnd finally, could a five-year-old have done better?\nMost certainly!

One project stood out to me \u2013 a new paper setting out a guide for\nlow- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to finance a\njust transition and their development goals.\nThe paper, called Data-To-Deal: an emerging and effective approach to financing the climate transition and\npublished on 26th\nJanuary, was written by a group of\nresearchers from Climate Compatible Growth (CCG).\nCCG is a research initiative funded by the UK\u2019s Foreign\nCommonwealth & Development Office which includes\nacademics from leading UK universities. Academics\nfrom Imperial involved in the report include CCG director Professor Mark Howells, CEP alumnus Hannah Luscombe, and current CEP Principal Research Fellow Dr\nVivien Foster.\nThis research addresses\na topic which is often\nthe subject of kitch-en-table debate \u2013 do we let the Global South industri-alise and pollute like the Global North did, or do we\nstop their continued development in pursuit of climate\ngoals? The problem is that we have no right to tell the\nGlobal South not to develop, but there may be a third option where the Global South gets to skip fossil fuels and\ngo straight to renewables.\nIf this were possible, it would help put the Global\nSouth on a level playing field with the Global North,\nhelping redefine colonial relationships which keep\nmanufacturing and industry out of these nations. International oil and gas companies which are investing\nin infrastructure in these nations maintain the colonial\nrelationship by keeping benefits to themselves.\nAccording to Dr Foster, \u201cData-to-Deal is a framework\noutlining the critical steps involved for LMICs to develop\ntheir own approach to planning and financing the climate transition.\u201d The guide is the result of collaboration\nbetween 60 specialists including government officials,\nfinanciers, and academics.\nThe first step is about getting high-level support in\ngovernment. In the case of Costa Rica, who successfully secured $2.4 billion in climate financing, this meant\nthe president publicly and clearly commiting to decar-bonisation. Engaging with\nthe Minister of Finance\nis important throughout\nthe process.\nAs high-lev-el support is being garnered, a country\nneeds to be building local capacity in universities and other stakeholders. All too\noften, governments receive analyses by international experts without the ability to do their own research. If data\ncan be gathered and analysed locally, it will be of a higher\nquality. That\u2019s not to dismiss the role of international ex-perts, who should have input during the modelling.\nThirdly, government ministers can work with local\nstakeholders to align their national development vision\nwith a climate transition. This process should help build\ntrust through transparency and national ownership.\nOnce complete, the vision can be shared publicly.\nAt this point, everyone understands the goals of a\ndecarbonisation strategy, which means modelling can\nbegin to build out the details. Consultations with stake-holder groups established previously should eventually\nproduce a decarbonisation strategy in alignment with\nthe national development plan. This\ncan be expanded to cover all sectors\nand ministries, setting out what they\ne a c h\nneed to\ndo. This\nm a k e s\nt h i n g s\nclear for investors and allows the Ministry of Finance\nto do cost-benefit analyses. The per-sector plans allow\nbudgeting on an individual project basis, making outcomes much clearer.\nThis whole plan exists to de-risk the experience for investors by making the process clear and the goals certain.\nAll political decisions are vulnerable to changes in gov-ernment, but this goes some way to producing a financing\nstrategy based on a trustworthy decarbonisation strategy.\nCosta Rica stands out as a case study: it raised $2.4 bn\nfrom initially investing only $200,000 in this process.\nCCG\u2019s goal is to take lessons from Costa Rica to other nations and encourage a similar approach. In general, they\npromote capacity building and the expertise required\nfor countries to make their own evidence-based policy\ndecisions.\nSECURE HIGH-LEVEL\nSUPPORT\nBUILD INSTITUTIONAL\nCAPACITY\nALIGN DEVELOPMENT\nVISION\nDELIBERATIVE\nMODELLING\nSTRENGTHEN POLICY\n& REGULATIONS\nDEVELOP CLIMATE\nFINANCING PLAN\nENGAGE WITH\nSTAKEHOLDERS\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\n\u001c\u001b\u001f\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u001f\u0016\u0015\u0014\u0015\u001f\u0013\u0012\u0017\u0017\u0018\u0011\u0010\u0015\u000f\u001f\u0018\u001a\u001f\u0016\u0012\u000e\u0010 \u001f\n\u0019\u0015\u0010\u0013\u001f\u0013\u000e\u001a\u001f\u001a\u0019\u0015\u001f \u0010\u0012\u0011 \u0010\u001f \u0012\u000e\u001a\u0019\u001f\u0012 \u001f \u001f\n\u0010\u0015\b\u0015\u0010\u001f\u0013\u0010 \u0007\u0018 \u0006\u001f\u001b\u0018\u0015\u0010 \u001f\u0016\u0018\u001a\u0019\u001f\n\u001a\u0019\u0015\u001f \u0010\u0012\u0011 \u0010\u001f\u0005\u0012\u0014\u001a\u0019\n\u201c\n\n"

In response to Working Group 3\u2019s report\nin the sixth assessment cycle, Guterres said, \u201cDemand\nthat renewable energy is introduced now at speed and\nat scale. Demand an end to coal-fired power. Demand an\nend to all fossil fuel subsidies.\u201d On the same report, Professor Skea said \u201cwe are not talking about business as\nusual if we are going to address the challenge of climate\nchange\u201d back when he was co-chair of working group 3.\nSkea\u2019s presentation, titled The need for science in a\ncarbon-constrained world, discussed how the IPCC informs policymakers and some key figures from the latest assessment cycle. It didn\u2019t explain well what scientists can do now that there is already such unequivocal\nevidence of climate change.\nThe Paris Agreement, agreed in 2015, has three main\ngoals:\nTo limit warming to well below 2\u00b0C, while pursuing\neffort to limit the increase to 1.5\u00b0C.\nTo increase the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts\nof climate change and foster climate resilience and low\ngreenhouse gas emission development.\nTo make finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resil-ient development.\nThe IPCC seeks to address all of these.\nProfessor Skea pointed out that we need to make a\n43% emissions reduction by 2030 relative to 2019 to\nmeet the 1.5\u00b0C target, and that the \u201crisks for a given level of warming are larger than we thought\u201d when comparing the findings of the sixth assessment cycle to the\nfifth. An alternate pathway to 1.5\u00b0C in 2100 would be to\nallow some temporary overshoot, and in this scenario,\nemissions would need to peak in or before 2030.\nThe Illustrative Pathways highlight some of our options for addressing global warming. We\u2019re on track for\nbetween 2.2 and 3.5\u00b0C of warming right now. However,\nscenarios such as the IMP-LD show we have other op-tions. This pathway leans on behavioural change early\nto give hard-to-decarbonise sectors the chance to do just\nthat, and in doing so would keep warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\nThere are big financial gaps that need to be filled to\ncombat climate change. Investment needs to scale up\nfour or five times to mitigate further global warming\nand even more toadapt to the effects of climate change.\n\u201cAdaptation and mitigation - there\u2019s no choice between\nthem, they\u2019re complimentary,\u201d said Professor Skea.\nThat said, investment in mitigation options like wind,\nsolar, and improving energy efficiency generally saves\nindividuals money in the long run.\nProject Drawdown reached similar conclusions\nacross many of the solutions they assessed. Drawdown\nestimates it would cost $0.92-1.89 trillion to build onshore wind turbines but they would reduce emissions\nby up to 143.56 GtCO2e by and result in $3.77-9.83 trillion in lifetime net operational savings .\nThere is currently no timetable for the seventh assessment cycle after the IPCC weren\u2019t able to agree one\nin the time they had. Professor Skea said chairing the\n\u201cIPCC is not easy but it\u2019s worth it.\u201d\nProfessor Skea is an emeritus professor at Imperial,\nand Climate and Innovation advisor at the Centre for Environmental Policy.
