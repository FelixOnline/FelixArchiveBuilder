    "content": "the Christmas film.\n(Empire, Leceister Square\nPlaze)\nThe man who was\nresponsible for the highly\nstylish Bladerunner and\nAlien, Ridley Scott, has\ndone a great deal of\nresearch into mythology for\nhis latest film Legend\n(Leicester Sq Theatre), an\nepic fairy tale. This\nresearch concentrated\nparticularly on the\nLiving legends\noccur en ce of a Jack o 'the\nGreen character in\nNorthern European\nmythology. However all this\neffort is wasted as Ridley\nScott appears to have\nexpended all his effort on\ncreating the right visual\nstyle, albeit an\nastonishingly beautiful one,\nand very little effort on plot\nand character is ation, a point not helped by the\ncasting of the rather poor\nTom Cruise as Jack.\nThe main thrust of this\ntale, like all good fairy tales\nis that the battle of good\nand evil, embodied in this\ncase by the Lord of\nDarkness, played by the\nmarvellous Tim Curry\nwhose gorgeous voice is\nsuitably demonic for the\nrole. Because the Lord of\nDarkness is fatally allergic\nto sunlight he plans to rid\nthe world of the unicorns\nthat maintain the harmony\nand light and plunge the\nland into darkness.\nUnfortunately not enough\ncare was taken\nover the development of\nthese characters or the plot\nso the film comes across as\nvacuous, but a sumptuous\nfeast for the eyes. Although\nthis is due largely to the\nremarkable visions of Scott,\nit would be remiss to fail to\nmention the impressive sets\nand incredible make-up\nparticularly on Tim Curry\nand Robert Picardo as Meg\nMucklebones.\nFinally of the films aimed\nlargely at children is an\nunusual one, Tuff, Turf. It\nis unusual because it\nalienates the audience that\nit is obviously aimed at and\nto whom it would appeal\nmost by virtue of the\ngraphic violence at the end\nand the subsequent 18\nceti fi cate. The violence is\nthe precipitation of the\ndesigns of the new kid in\ntown, from a rich\nbackground, on the local\ngang leader's girl fiend. Although it is a well-worn\nstory and director\nincorporates some clever\nideas, and some of the\nTough enough?\nscenes are very involving,\nbut there are also some\ntruly dire moments, such as\nwhen our hero serenades\nthe girl at the country club.\nIt's an average sort of film,\nbut unfortunately for it's normally imaginative\ndistributors, Blue Dolphin\nFilms, it is likely to be\nunfairly ignored in the face\nof Christmas com petit on. Happy Christmas, all.\nJim Claydon.\nJim's12 favourite films of\n1985 (in no particular order);\nOnce upon a Time in\nAmerica\n1984\nAmadeus\nStranger Then Paradise\nHeimut\nThe Purple Rose of Cairo\nWetherby\nWitness\nSubway\nMishima\nWhen Father was away on\nBusiness\nVigil\nBack To the Future\nDance with a Stranger\nElem Klimov has recently\nreceived a lot of publicity,\nin the film world at least,\nfor his recent anti-Nazi film\nGo and See shown at the\nfilm festival. But until that\nfilm is released it is\npossible to see some of this\ntalented film maker's work\nin the form of the nine year\nold Agony (Camden Place,\nChelsea Cinema). It has\ntaken so long to reach the\nscreen here because the\nSoviet authorities felt that\nthis story of Rasputin\nportrayed Tsar Nicholas II\ntoo sym pathi call y. The film is set in 1916\nwhen Russia was a particularly corrupt and\nunjust society, with\nmerciless exploitation of\nthe workers, police tyranny,\nhunger and devastation.\nAgainst this backdrop, the\nTsar felt that only a miracle\nwould save the Empire and\nenable the generals to\ncrush the rebels as they\nhad done in 1905.\nEnter Rasputin, powerfully\nplayed by Alexi Petrenkov,\nan illiterate Siberean\npeasant, ex-horse thief, and\nwandering monk. Curing\nthe sick and uttering\nstrange speeches he\nrapidly acquires the\ncomplete confidence of the\nTsarina and hence wields\ngreat influence in the\nRussian court.\nThe film uses a mixture of\ndocumentary footage, black\nand white and colour film\nto intelligent effect, and the\nRa Ra Rasputin\nshots of faces particularly\nare impressively composed\nand lit. A film with a title\nlike Agony readily lends\nitself to abuse by critics\nand I'm sure that alot of my\ncolleagues will make some\nwitty comments about it,\nprobably in reference to it's length, two and half hours,\nbut I didn't find that time\ndragged and I was quite\nimpressed, though I don't expect that this will be\neveryone's idea of a good\nnight out.\nDavid Hare usually writes\nvery intelligent works,\nWetherby, Pravda, and his\nrecent adaptation of his\nown stage play, Plenty\n(ABC Shaftsbury Av) is no\nexception. It contrast's the\ndesire of it's impatient lead,\nSusan, to move on against\nthe unfulfilled optimism of\npost-war Britain. Through\nthe use of some cleverly\nsketched characters the\ninsidious class-cons cio u ness and snobbery\nof the British is brought to\nlight. An example of the\nhigh quality of both the\nacting and also the writing\nis the char c ter of Sir\nAndrew Charleson, whose\nbrief, but brilliant\nappearance epi to mises the\nrestraint and sense of\npropriety that Susan finds\nso frustrating.\nFollowing her experience\nwith the French Resistance\nin the War, a time when she\nfelt that she could see the\nLie back and.\nbest of people in an hour,\nshe longs for a change that\nshe feels can happen in the\nnew Britain. But failing to\nfj j pd any change or the\npassion she felt with Lazar,\nSam Niell, during the war,\nshe settles for the\nsympathy and comfort of\nthe diplomat Raymond\nBrock, Charles Dance.\nHare's decision to\nconcentrate on the world of\ndiplomacy emphasises the\nqualities in the British\n...think of Britain\nwhich so annoy Susan and\nin which, as Sir Andrew\nsays, the British lead the\nworld.\nThe characters are all very\nwell played with John\nGeilgud as a senior\ndiplomat, Tracey Ullman as\na friend providing some\nlaughs, and Sting, as the\nlower class sentimental\nlover, very capably\ndelivering the epitaph, 'You\npeople are cruel and\ndangerous. You fuck\npeople up'. This is a shrewd observation as the\ncharacters are largely\nunpleasant and\nunsympathetic, giving the\naudience little to identify\nwith. But in spite of this the\nwonderful photography and\nskillfully understated\ndirection by Fred Schepisi\nmanages to involve the\naudience in this fine film.\nFELIX 11 December 1985 23\n\n"

    "content": "cheapness but there is also much more\nflexibility since you're not tied to hotel meal\ntimes, and there's no restriction on bringing\nin your own booze from the supermarket\n(given the bar prices this saves a small\nfortune). Evening entertainment is usually\nwhat you make of it\u2014being in an apartment\nyou're automatically in a group, and\napartment parties are the 'in' thing. Other\nthan that there are bars, restaurants, discos,\netc which are often half empty in the late\nevening. For all abilities the purpose-built\ncentres offer an unrivalled range of\nskiing\u2014often more than even the best skier\ncan cover in a week. Many resorts are linked,\nso a day's skiing can take the form of an\nexcursion on skis. For the ski fanatic they are\nunequalled and for the beginner there are\nalso advantages\u2014skiing from your doorstep\n(anyone who's walked even a short distance\nin ski boots carrying skis will appreciate this),\nand the well designed lift system reduces\nqueueing (if at the end of the aforementioned\nwalk you have to join an hour-long queue for\nthe cable car, you'll appreciate this too). For\nexample, in Tignes if you ever have to queue\nfor more than ten minutes you get your lift\npass price refunded.\nItaly\nAfter becoming very popular a few years ago\nItaly has declined as the price differential\nwith other countries has narrowed. However,\nit is still a popular destination and is\nreasonably priced. Most Italian resorts give\nthe impression that they just 'happened'\nrather than being carefully planned as with\nthe French purpose built resorts, or having\nstrictly controlled development as with the\ntraditional Austrian or Swiss resorts. Many\nconsist of a small old part, which is usually\nin a bad state of disrepair, and masses of\nmodern hotels all around. Apartment\nac com md ation is often also available,\nespecially in larger resorts such as Cervinia\nand Courmayeur.\nOne Italian resort popular with British\nSkiers is Sauze d 'Oulx. I'd definitely give this\none a miss. The Brits who go there are the\nsame ones who fill the concrete tower block\nhotels of the Costa Brava at a different time\nof the year. A Benidorm of the alps is not my\nidea of a good ski resort and although the\nskiing is surprisingly good you probably\nwon't get enough sleep to appreciate it.\nWhen to go\nUndergraduates may be constrained by\nvacation dates to a week over Christmas or\nNew Year, or around Easter. However, these\ndates tend to be the most expensive,\nex pec i ally the former. The price of skiing\nholidays performs a double hump through\nthe season, starting low pre-Christmas,\nshooting up over the holiday period, falling\nto the cheapest time in January, rising for\nschool half term before a less marked fall in\nearly March leading to a rise for the end of\nthe season at Easter.\nFirst of all don't, whatever you do, go pre-Christmas. I know it's cheap, but you'll\nprobably find most of the resort's facilities\nhaven't yet opened (the swim ing pool will\nalways be empty!), and the snow may well\nlack a firm base layer. The Christmas\nvacation should be alright if you can afford\nit, although the resorts will be packed and\nthe days are short and cold. For a budget\nholiday go mid-January\u2014it can be bitterly\ncold, but there will almost definitely be\nplenty of snow, un crowded slopes and it is\nvery cheap. Early March is also fairly cheap,\nand it is warmer with lighter evenings (hence\nmore precious hours on the slopes). Easter is\na bit risky for snow, but this depends on how\nearly in the year it is. Easter 1986 is quite\nearly and so should be okay.\nThe temperature varies enormously from\nearly to late season. At Christmas and in\nJanuary the temperature rarely approaches\nzero (from below that is!) even in strong\nsunshine. The sun is weak, hence you don't tan easily. But at Easter it can be relatively\nhot, and sun-burn can be a real hazard, so\ntake some high protection sun cream (at least\nfactor 6 or 7). If you're not sur? about\nwithstanding the cold you're better off\nplumping for a late season trip.\nEquipment\nUnless you're a proficient skier there is no\npoint in buying your own equipment. For\nyour first trip all you need is good ski\nclothing, since all your skiing equipment is\nbest hired in the resort. For a beginner you\nshouldn't bother with anything flashy, just\nmid-length skis of between shoulder and head\nheight, depending on build. The base should\nbe reasonably gouge-free. The bindings\nshould be easy to step into and release\nyourself from, and they should be specially\nadjusted for your weight and ability.\nThe most important item of equipment is\nboots. If your feet are cold and\nuncomfortable you can't ski\u2014it is as simple\nas that. When trying boots on, clip up both\nof them properly and walk around the shop\nfor a few minutes. If you have any doubts\nask to try another pair\u2014this is common\npractice, you aren't being an awkward\ncustomer. Return them for another pair later\nin the holiday if you find you have trouble\non the slopes.\nIf you are considering buying some\nequipment after one or two weeks skiing\nexperience, boots are the item you should go\nfor first. Spend at least an hour in the shop\nwearing the boots you intend to buy. If you\ncan find a comfortable pair, nothing else\nreally matters. Personally, I swear by\nSalomon boots, but then I may have funny\nfeet.\nYou will require special ski clothing, ie. a ski anorak and ski pants or salo pet tes. If\nyou're going in mid-winter these must be of a high quality. If this is your first trip try\nborrowing from a friend, since ski clothing is\n'not cheap. If you are buying it is possible to\nkeep the cost down by opting for less\nfashionable makes, like Rodeo (C&A). Ski\nresorts are a poseur's paradise so expensive\nfashionable ski clothes such as Ellesse and\nKilly abound, but aren't necessary, especially\nfor beginners. It doesn't matter what label\nyou've got on your designer one-piece ski suit\nif you can't move without falling over you're\nstill going to look a complete wally!\nYou'll also need good quality special skiing\ngloves, ordinary gloves are no good at all.\nDon't skimp on this item or you'll regret\nit\u2014having cold hands is almost as bad as\ncold feet. In addition, you'll need a ski-hat,\nsunglasses or goggles, some good quality ski\nsocks and several thin sweaters including\nsome polo necks (rather than wearing thick\nsweaters, you should wear two or more thin\nlayers).\nWe are well placed for buying ski clothing\nand equipment. Kensington High Street has\nbranches of Alpine Sports, Snow & Rock and\nC&A, while Brompton Road has Sun'n 'Snow\nand Harrods. The are also larger branches of\nall the ski shops in central London.\nLearning to Ski\nSki instruction is a vital part of any skiing\nholiday, at least until you have several weeks\nof skiing experience under your belt. The\nteaching method varies from country to\ncountry in accordance with the policy of the\nnational ski school. The Austrian method,\nwhich is probably the most traditional, is\nespecially good for the less confident\nbeginner. The Austrians have a reputation for\nhigh quality instruction with instructors who\nspeak good English, which is undoubtedly\ndeserved. French teaching uses more modern\nmethods designed to allow faster progression\nto more advanced techniques, which may suit\nthe more impatient. Their instructors, being\nFrench, tend not to speak such good English.\nSimilar comments apply to the Swiss. Italian\ninstruction tends to be of the 'follow me'\nvariety, where the class is expected to keep\nup with the instructor whilst he\nflies off down the slope for long\nstretches at a time showing what a good skier\nhe is. No doubt there are good Italian\ninstructors but the overall standard is\nprobably lower than in other countries.\nThe French in particular have developed\nnew teaching methods available only in\ncertain resorts. The best known is ski evo lu tif at Les Arcs, but there are other schemes. I personally wouldn't recommend those, since\nthere is no real short cut to skiing\nproficiency, but if you think you may lack\nper serve rence they may make the first stage\nof learning a bit easier. These methods\ninvolve starting on considerably shorter than\nnormal skis and increasing the length through\nthe week.\nIf you are going skiing for the first time a course of lessons on a dry slope is well worth\nconsidering. Whilst skiing is an utterly\nmarvelous sport once you can do a bit,\nstruggling to get used to having a plank\nstrapped to each foot and generally falling\nabout all over the slope is best done before\nsetting off on holiday. You can start\nat the same level as someone who has been\nskiing before, after a few hours instruction on\na dry slope. The best slope within easy reach\nof IC is the Blue Sky Slope at Uxbridge, and\nthe Ski Club organise trips there every\nTuesday and Wednesday. Personally I think\nthere are few things as boring as dry slope\nskiing once you've achieved a reasonable\nstandard, but for learning the basics they are\nextremely useful.\nFitness\nAny reasonably fit person should cope with a skiing holiday without problem especially at\nbeginner's level. For more advanced skiers\nfitness is more vital since they ski faster and\nharder than beginners. However, a few gentle\nexercises never did anyone any harm and\nmay help prevent you stiffening up whilst on\nholiday. I can't include a guide to\npre-ski exercises here, but a few weeks of\nstandard physical jerks before you\ngo will help. If you play any form of sport\nregularly you should already be fit enough\nwithout special exercises.\nSkiing is Wonderful\nThere are few people who don't enjoy a skiing holiday, and more and more people\nare getting the bug every year. When I first\nwent skiing many years ago recreational\nskiing was in its infancy, ski boots were made\nof leather and had laces, and skis were\nwooden with screwed-on edges and cable\nbinding. Since then the sport has changed out\nof all recognition. It has devotees from all\nwalks of life, and is no longer seen as a pastime for the rich. It has all the necessary\ningredients of a great holiday\u2014sun, fresh air,\nfantastic scenery, physical activity, not to\nmention the a pre s ski! If you've never tried\nit, you almost certainly wouldn't be\ndisappointed.\nFELIX 11 December 1985 21\n\n"

Their arms, heads\nhips and even cheeks move\nas they strum and blow\ntheir way towards the 25th of December, illuminated\nby a tasteful light display.\nAnd at the end of the\ngrotto? Well, it's the man\nhimself, old Father\nChristmas, grinning behind\nhis whiskers and yo-ho-ho-ing, dispensing little gifts\nand reminding children that\nif they're not good little\nboys and girls then they\nwon't get any presents.\nJohn is an expert Santa.\nHe's been behind those\nwhiskers for four years at\nthis store alone (although\nnot without breaks,\nobviously), and also does\nother Santa\u2014ing. He's dispensed coal to\npensioners for the National\nCoal Board, and when he\nwas in the RAF he used to\narrive at airbases with his\nsack to find queues of little\nscrubbed faces: the\nchildren of the airmen. He's obviously at ease with\nchildren and they love him\nfor it.\nEric has been Father\nXmas for nowhere near as\nlong. He turned up to\nDebenhams a few weeks\nago trying to get a little\ntemporary work on the run\nup to Xmas, and was\noffered the red suit. He\nadmits to being 'surprised'.\nHe was not formally trained\nfor the job, but\ncommonsense goes a long\nway: don't talk down to the\nchildren; when one Santa\ngoes for lunch arrange the\ntransfer so it is impossible\nfor any child to see two\nSantas at once. He soon\ngot all but the most\npetrified children out of\ntheir shells.\nAnd what of those chain-store-Santa myths? Do\nchildren attempt to pull the\nbeard off? Well, they .\ncouldn't if they tried. It is\nattached by a piece of\nelastic, and this means it\nrequires a gently guiding\ninfluence to stop it from\nriding up your face. With\none hand resting gently on\nthe whiskers no brat is\ngoing to reveal the bare\nflash beneath.\nThe other legend is that\nof cantankerous Santas; the\njob being given to a nasty\nold man who drinks far too\nmuch at iu nch times and\narrives late only to breath\nbeer y fumes all over\ninnocent, angelic four year\nolds. John had worked with\none before. 'They had to\nget rid of him, of course.'\nAlthough some children\nrun giggling into Santa's arms, this is not as\ncommon as you might\nthink. After all, parents are\nrightly concerned that their\nson or daughter should not\ntalk or accept gifts from\nstrange men: Santa Claus,\ngiving out presents wearing\na ridiculous fake wig, fits\nthat description very well.\nThus many children,\nespecially younger ones,\nare hesitant. However Eric\nand John proved masters at\nstarting the youngsters\ntalking, sitting them on\ntheir knee and getting them\nto take their thumbs out of\ntheir mouths (the child's mouth that is). I sat and\nwatched these pro Santas\nduring the morning and\nthey had few very scared\nchildren, and none cried.\nOf course very young\nchildren (two or less)\nunderstood very little, but\nthey loved the teddy bear\njazz band (I defy you to go\nand not tap your feet).\nThey were asked what\nthey wanted for Xmas, and\nthen always told that Father\nChristmas would do his\nbest, and reminded to be\ngood. And what do these\nbudding capitalists want?\nThe class of 1985 want\nTransformers, A La Carte\nKitchens, 'My Little Pony',\nA Team figures and\nCabbage Patch Dolls.\nWhither Meccano?\nThey were always asked\ntheir name and age. As the\ngifts were in age and sex\ncategories Santa needed to\nknow whether he was\ntalking to a little boy or a little girl, and as well as\nbeing good Santa Claus\ntechnique to call the child\nby his or her name, it also\ntells you the sex (almost\nalways). After just three\nweeks Eric was able to\nguess age with a95% success rate, but up to the\nage of seven he still found\ntelling the sex tricky.\nNeither Eric nor John did\nmuch yo-ho-ho-ing. The\nlittle ones are quick to spot\na lack of sincerity, and\nnatural yo-ho-ho-ers are\nfew and far between. Pity.\nA little boy specifically\nasked Eric to yo-ho-ho, but\nthat's the only time he's done it. The presents were,\nfor 75p, remarkable value;\nPlasticene, building bricks,\ndolls, writing sets, all\npackaged in big red\nenvelopes with teddy bears\non, and put into big toy\nbaskets. Much to my\ndisappointment no metal\nbadges were given and I thought the Teddy bear\nstickers were a pretty poor\nsubstitute. I wouldn't take\n\u00a310 for my 'I saw Santa at\nShepherds Store,\nGateshead, Christmas 1972'\nbadge.\nSo I spent the morning\nwatching the professional\nSantas at work, helping to\nkeep the toy baskets full,\nand trying not to get in the\nway. During one\nparticularly quiet period a large group of streetwise\n13-year-old refugees from\none of the local schools\ndrifted through. Like\neveryone else they were\ncharmed by the teddy bear\njazz band, and after\nwatching that they had a bit of a banter with FC, Eric\ncoping perfectly. After\ngiving a 'See you round,\nSanta', all but one breezed\nout. One precocious girl\nremained; 'Ere Santa, why\ndidn't yer ask us what we\nwanted fer Christmas'. Eric\ngrinned, 'I can't bring you\nwhat you want for\nChristmas...' .he said.\nLunch was my first\nhurdle, and I nearly made\nmy first mistake. At the\nDebenhams canteen I almost ordered a cheese\nand onion pl el The effect of\nthis on my afternoon's activities doesn't bear\nthinking about. Fancy a Father Christmas with\nsmelly breath?\nReady for battle, I checked my equipment.\nThe tension on the belt\nseemed OK; the red fluffy\nsuit fitted fine; the beard\nitched slightly, and it had a tendency to attempt to\ncrawl up my nose, but it\nseemed reasonable.\nDesperately trying to\nremember Eric and John's advice I placed my festive\nbum on the big armchair at\nthe end of the grotto, and\nprepared to wait. During a Saturday maybe 400\nchildren pass through the\ngrotto, but today,\nThursday, 100 would be\nmore usual. Thus there are\nthe occasional periods\nwhere there are no victims\nin the gunsight s, and I had\ntime to adjust the toy\nbaskets and let my eyes get\nused to the light. Then,\nfrom behind a tuba-playing\nteddy bear appeared a fee\npaying customer, and with\nEric in mufti standing a discrete distance away in\ncase of trouble, I beckoned.\nI asked 6-year-old Lisa\nwhat she wanted for\nChristmas, told her to be\ngood, asked her to leave\nme some milk and a mince\npie beside the chimney and\nsent her, blinking, into the\nmain store again, her tiny\nhands clutching a gift\nsuitable for her age and\nsex. Seems easy. Then\ntrouble. I had my first\nexperience of a child\ncrying, something that I had not seen Eric or John\nhaving to cope with. He\nstarted off toddling towards\nme perfectly OK, I bellowed\n'Hello young man, have you\ncome to see me?'( an\nobviously rhetorical\nquestion, as who else\n11 December 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Look Back In Anger\nOverworked FELIX reporter Bill Goodwin takes\nanother look at this term's news.\nThe news in this term's FELIX has undoubtedly\nbeen dominated by the\nUnion bar. Strong feelings\nwere first aroused when\nRefectory Manager Rob\nNorthey miscalculated bar\nprice rises. Two weeks later\nBar Manager, Doug\nArmstrong and barman\nBrian Ellison resigned after\nan argument with Mr\nNorthey. Mr Northey was\ncritical of their\narrangements for the bar\nfacilities during the fresher s New Year's Party; he felt\nthat an extra can bar was\nneeded. Mr Armstrong and\nMr Ellison said they had\nput a lot of work into the\nbar and pointed out they\nhad taken almost \u00a33374,\nwhich was a record for the\nNew Year's Party. They felt\nthat Mr Northey's comments could only be\ntaken as a vote of no\nconfidence and thus they\nfelt obliged to resign. Ugly\nscenes followed when\nstudents in the Union Bar\nlearned of the resignations.\nAt the next UGM it was\ndecided to organise a seven day bar boycott to\ndemonstrate the Union's dissatisfaction. The boycott\nproved very successful and\nCollege Secretary John\nSmith agreed to plan a Union takeover of the Bar\nwith IC Union President\nCarl Burgess. Later it\ntranspired that he wanted\nthe Botany-Zoology\ncommon rooms and the\nLounge for conversion into\nlecture theatres. The\nBiology Department\nrequired the rooms so that\nacademics from Ashurst\nLodge could be\naccommodated when the\nLodge is sold.\nMeanwhile another\nbarman, Tony McVey,\nfailed to open the Union\nBar one Saturday and was\npromptly sacked by Mr\nNorthey. Mr McVey claimed\nthat his absence was due to\na mild form of food\npoisoning.\nAgreement was finally\nreached between the\nRector, Professor Ash, and\nMr Burgess over the Union\nbar's future. The Union will\nbe taking financial control\nof the bar on January 1. In\nFELIX\nreturn the Bot-Zoo\nCommon Room will be\nconverted into a lecture\ntheatre, and the Union\nDining Room and Senior\nCommon Room are to be\nhired out in the mornings\nto the Biology department.\nProfessor Manny\nLehman's decision to\naccept a contract for\nresearch into software for\nthe 'Star Wars' project was\nmore than a little\ncontroversial. Many\nmembers of the Computing\nDepartment believed that\nthe software required\nwould either prove too\ncomplex to work, or that it\nwould be unsafe; the\ngreatest danger coming\nfrom the errors in the\nprogram which could\nremain undetected until the\nprogram was executed.\nHead of Department,\nProfessor Bruce Sayers\nwas concerned that work\non SDI would divert scarce\nresources away from\ncurrent projects such as\nthe Alvey program.\nProfessor Lehman agreed\nthat SDI would not work,\nbut explained that the\npoliticians would not\nbelieve this until it had\nbeen proved.by research.\nHe took the stance that SDI\nresearch was essential and\nwould have enormous\nbenefits for society.\nThe exploits of the\n'Phantom Soaker'\ndampened many an ego\nthis term. The Soaker is\nreputed to have tipped bin\nliners of water over more\nthan 30 gentleman as they\nsat in cubicles in the\nCollege conveniences.\nAmong those caught \"with\ntheir trousers down' were\nIC Union President Carl\nBurgess and Chief Security\nOfficer Geoff Reeves. Mr\nReeves made unprintable\nthreats against the Soaker,\nwhen and if he should be\ncaught. Two letters signed\nby the Soaker were\ndelivered to FELIX. They\nwere in different styles of\nhandwriting; only the\nearlier letter is believed to\nbe genuine. Despite Mr\nReeves' attempts to analyse\nthe hand-writing, the\nidentity of the Soaker\nremains a mystery.\nSouthside hit the\nheadlines once more this\nterm. Strong feelings were\naroused over the kitchen\nfacilities. Residents\ncomplained about the\nmodification work in\nprogress. The original\nintention was to install\nkitchens on each stairway,\nreplacing the old kitchens\non the gallery level with\nbedrooms. These proposals\nhad been agreed by the\nStudent Residence\nCommittee the previous\nyear. The Southside Hall\nCommittee claimed that the\nresidents had not been\nconsulted enough, and\nexpressed their concern\nthat noise and smells from\nkitchens would interrupt\nthe Hall's social set up.\nResidents of Southside\nsigned a petition\nsupporting an alternative\nidea, proposing to extend\nthe original kitchen by\nplacing the tables and\nlockers elsewhere. Carl\nBurgess supported this\npetition, which was\ndelivered to Peter\nHallworth, the Managing\nSurveyor of Residences. Mr\nHallworth eventually agreed\nto its proposals. Falmouth\nKeogh Hall, however,\nelected to opt for the\nstairway kitchens.\nMuch uproar was caused\nby the Union's ban on this\nyear's Rag Mag. It was\ndescribed by Mr Burgess as\n'shocking, disgusting and\nappalling'. The president of\nCity and Guilds, Roger\nPreece, warned that\nImperial could become\n'more renowned for its\nobscenities than for its\nexcellence' if the Rag Mag\nwere released.\nThe ban was imposed\nbecause of doubts as to the\nlegality of the publication,\nfrom which the printer's name had been omitted,\nand the dubious nature of\nits contents.\nDuring the UGM the\nUnion sabbaticals were\ncriticised for not checking\nthe contents of the Rag\nMag before it was printed,\nas they are empowered to\ndo. It was agreed that a censorship committee\nwould be formed for next\nyear's magazine.\nThe ban was ultimately\nlifted in the interests of\nRag. The Rag Mag\nappeared in its original\nform, apart from the\naddition of printer's name,\nwhich was stamped in.\nReactions from many\nstudents were positive.\nWacky Education Minister Sir Keith\nJoseph appeals for the return of\nhis false teeth, during his visit\nto IC this term.\n\n"

    "content": "By Cy Nichol\nSomewhere in this article it\nwould seem appropriate to\nexpress some seasonal\nsentiments. So without\nfurther ado may I suggest\nthat this Christmas you\nuphold the spirit of IC in\ncarrying on ancient\ntraditions and go down to\nStonehenge and sacrifice a virgin/hippy/sabbatical or\nwhatever else takes your\nfancy.\nOne of ICs oldest centres\nof tradition, dating back to\nthe early twenties, is the\nUnion Bar. Trust this\nerstwhile institution to\ncome to the aid of sweating\nnews editors this year by\nsupplying plentiful\ncontroversy. And if I'm not\nmistaken there's more\nbrewing in the pipeline. It\nwould seem that at long\nlast the Union will be\nrunning Its own bar, and\nrightly so. The question\nnow is how it will run in\nfuture. Even the most\nexperienced union hacks\nseem at a loss to provide\nanswers. It seems that\nrather than being wrested\nfrom the grip of a draconian college\nauthority, Sherfield were\nalmost glad to be rid of the\nbar, and, further, that they\nmight see it as a way of\nfoisting some of their other\nproblems on to the Union.\nWith the Union due to\nbecome responsible for the\nrunning of the bar in early\nJanuary there is little news\navailable on how this will\nbe achieved. It was\nreported by witnesses that\nat a recent bar committee\nmeeting refectory manager\n'Honest Rob' Northey was\nseen chortling at Union\ndeputy president Dave\nKingston about the way he\nwas 'running circles'\naround the hapless\nsabbatical. It seems that\nwhen the Union takes\ncontrol it will be\nresponsible for all aspects\nof the bar, and that at\npresent Mr Northey is\npreparing to run the bar\ndown to a minimum level at\nthe end of term. This little\nproblem is nothing to the\none of finding someone to\nrun the bar. Rumours\nabound about old barmen\nand friends of union hacks\nbeing selected before the\njob is even advertised to\nsuch an extent that I cannot even dream of\nsuggesting any one of them\nIs true. At the moment the\nbar is in a sad state, the\nsystem of taking union\ncards for pots still breaks\ndown, there seems to be\nregular vandalism and\n\u2022 some of the people who\nmight revive the\natmosphere seem to have\nforsaken the place totally.\nThe more unkind among us\nhave suggested that the\nwhole business has less to\ndo with sound economic\nreasoning and a lot more to\ndo with the pseudo-freemasonry that surrounds\ncertain tie clubs. Further\nthan this I do not intend to\ncomment lest I be struck\ndown by the 'curse of the\nbar' or found stabbed in the\nheart with my left trouser\nleg rolled up.\nOn to more mundane\nmatters. After a while\nrumours about who's' bon king' with who get\nremarkably tedious, and\nanyway I mustn't let the\ntone of this article fall too\nlow. However there are\nexceptions, especially for\npeople with cleaner-than-clean reputations. One\nsuch is genial Guilds\npresident and notorious\nself-promotion a list Roger\nPreece. This is not to judge\nMr Preece in any way, for\nas he says in the recent\nFELIX Sex special, it is the\nChristian way to follow the\nbiblical teaching to the best\nof one's ability not to imply\nany absolute judgement.\nHowever the extent of Mr\nPreece's latest infatuation\nmust raise some questions\nof a moral nature. The\nobject of his attention is a young lady in Mines but\nbeyond that it is not polite\nto be more precise. Friends\nhave let slip that our hero\nhas been making\nclandestine enquiries after\nthe young lady for a considerable amount of\ntime, although he called off\ntrying to take her to an\narmy dinner when he\ndiscovered to his dismay\nthat she had a current\nboyfriend. However the\ncourse of true lust held\nstrong and the dashing\nlieutenant persisted in his\nquest at every possible\nopportunity until he was\nrecently disturbed by a close friend of mine with\nsome of his clothes a touch\nawry, shall we say (this\nphrase is approved by the\nFelix Sex Editor as suitable\nfor the general public).\nHowever the matter which\nhas really brought this case\nto my attention is the\nprestige o us cocktail party\nbeing thrown by Guilds to\npromote itself to\n(potentially generous)\nparties from outside\ncollege. The guest list has\n'been limited to a very\nexclusive list of Guilds\nstudents who are to be\nthere to act as hosts to the\nvarious mayors, MPs and\ncaptains of industry.\nSurprise then to find that a certain friend of our\nillustrious president\nappears on the same list for\nwhat is 'a serious occasion\nfor the promotion of the\nimage of Guilds union and\nin no way a freebie for\nhacks'. When questioned\nabout this Mr. Preece said\nhe had decided that there\nwas room for 'other\nstudents' to help out in an\nassisting role. Believe\nnothing on the basis of\npublic image\nSpeaking of misleading\npublic image, IC closet\nromeo Dave Kingston has\nbeen letting himself in for it\nagain. Apparently his life is\nbeing made difficult by the\nnumber of complaining\nstudents being sent to him\nby student services. It has\nbeen suggested by people\nwith connections in that\npart of college that Dave's troubles are due to the fact\nthat he has recently jilted\none of the female\nemployees. Not content\nwith ignoring advice over\nthe bar, it seems that\nsabbaticals are not aware\nof the well known sayings\nabout 'women scorned'.\nAs this is a special\nedition I think it's about\ntime some of our esteemed\neditor's excesses were\nbrought to light (especially\nas he tells me to write\nsome of this stuff). Hugh\nhas recently begun playing\nhockey for the IC 3rd team\nwhich may well explain\nsome of the content of the\nsports pages these days.\nBut before you jump to any\nconclusions about our\nman's sporting skills I should comment that, from\npersonal experience, 3rd team fixtures are very much\na social activity. Now jovial\nHugh is not one to shy\naway from being the life\nand soul of the party and\nhas been seen on several\noccasions to be well\n'refreshed' after matches.\nMore interesting still is\nthe'regard in which Hugh's driving is held by the team.\nAfter driving the team\nminibus to a recent fixture\nin Reading it was\nunanimously decided that\nIC Hon. Sec. Quentin\n'would you buy a used\ntransit from this man'\nFontana should take the\nwheel on the return journey\nfor the benefit of all present\n(including the minibus). Mr\nSouthey is not rumoured to\nbe thinking of a career\nrunning his own coach\ncompany.\n1\nCongratulations are in\norder for RCS Hon. Sec.\nTom Melliar-Smith who has\nrecently been told that his\nhealth has improved\nsufficiently for him to enjoy\nlife to the full again (this\nfollows a serious head\ninjury he sustained during\nthe summer). It would seem\nthat Tom has taken full\nadvantage of his new\nfreedom for not only was\nhe heard wandering around\ncollege last week claiming\nhe had been raped but on\nFriday he was asked to take\npart in a police identity\nparade. Tom's friends\nwould like to say welcome\nback and take it easy as\nyou've got another eighty\nyears at least.\nAnd finally, a late news\nitem has just come in\nregarding RCS Ents\nChairman and champion\ndegenerate Guy Perry. Mr\nPerry is famed in RCS for\nhis ability to consume a pint of human urine, which\nhe did to raise \u00a310 for rag\nearlier this term.\nUnfortunately common\nalcohol appears to have a rather more serious effect\non Guy. I am informed he\nhas just spent a night in the\ncells of the Metropolitan\npolice following his arrest\non the RCS carol singing'\nevening somewhere in the\nvicinity of Leicester Square.\nThe officers of the law were\nkind enough not to bring\nany charges, being content\nto advise him to be more\ncareful what he drinks in\nfuture.\n>\nHapless DP, Dave\nKingston, really seems\nincapable of making a fool\nof himself. Several weeks\nago FELIX ran a story\nentitled small is beautiful.\nFELIX threatened to expose\nMr Kingston in all his glory\nif he failed to make a donation to Rag. We can\nnow reveal that Mr\nKingston was conned.\nUnfortunately in the photo\nMr Kingston's private parts\nare covered.\nFELIX 11 December 1985\n\n"

A motion\nto create the post was\npassed at the IC UGfvl on\nTuesday 23rd December.\nProposing the motion,\nDebra Exall said the\nelection of such an officer\nwould be the first step\ntowards an improvement in\nconditions for women at IC.\nAlan Rose, proposing an\namendment to the motion,\nfelt that the idea of a special Women's Officer\nwould lead to the problems\nin question being ignored\nby the other officers, and\nsuggested that an inquiry\nshould be set up instead,\nthe results of which would\nbe presented at a future\nUGM. When the\namendment was rejected, a further amendment was\nproposed, 'recommending\nthat there should be both a Women's Officer appointed,\nand an inquiry organised'.\nThis amendment was\ncarried.\nAnother motion to deal\nspecifically with sexism in\neducational was passed\nwithout question. Proposed\nby Union President Carl\nBurgess, the motion\nsupported the efforts of the\ncampaign for Women In\nScience and Engineering\n(WISE).

However, a procedural motion forced\nthe meeting to an\nautomatic vote, and the\nmotion was carried.\nTwo further items on the\nagenda remained\nun debated by the end of\nthe meeting, including\nMichael Newman's motion\non Union organisation held\nover from two previous\nUGM's. Tuesday's UGM\nwas called to a close as the\ndebate on this motion was\nabout to start.\nA Question of Degrees\nGraduates of the College's four year engineering\ncourses will be awarded\nMaster of Engineering\n(MEng) degrees as from\n1987. Most three year\nengineering courses\nleading to BSc(Eng)\ndegrees will be\nredesignated BEng degrees\nat the same time.\nThe University of\nLondon's Academic\nCouncil has agreed to the\nnecessary change in the\nUniversity statutes. The\nchanges are now at a consultative stage as\nrequired by the University\nof London Act 1978.\nFollowing acceptance by\nthe University Senate the\nstatute changes must then\nbe ratified by the Privvy\nCouncil. This long process\nmeans that the changes will\nnot be in time for 1986\ngraduates to be awarded\nthe new degrees.\nThe delay in getting the\nchanges approved will lead\nto some obvious anomalies.\nStudents graduating from\nfour year courses in 1986\nwill get a BEng, whereas\nthose graduating from the\nsame course the year after\nwill get a MEng. At the\nsame time those on three\nyear courses will get a BEng which went to four\nyear course students the\nyear before.\nVery Extremely Guilty\nPresident Roger Preece\nwas tried at the Guilds\nChristmas U GM in Mech\nEng 220 last Tuesday. In\nhis absence, Mr Preece was\naccused of many crimes,\ntoo many for the\nprosecuting Council to list\nbut including; missing a dip\nin the sea at Brighton,\nrefer ing to Boanerges, the\nUnion's mascot, as a 'she',\ncalling Mrs Ash, Mrs\nFlowers and forgetting Mrs\nAsh's flowers. Due to a schedule clash, Mr Preece\nwas not available for the\ntrial, but in his absence, a jury of six bad men and\nfalse found him 'very, very,\nvery, extremely guilty'. He\nwas then sentenced to a ducking in the serpentine.\nAn amendment to the\nsentence suggested that\nICU Deputy President Dave\nKingston was equally\nquilty. The judge agreed\nand conferred the same\npunishment upon him.\nAfter the close of the\nmeeting, most of those\npresent moved to the\nSenior Common Room and\nbodily removed Mr Preece\nfrom a Union Finance\nCommittee meeting. Mr\nKingston was left behind as\nthe Guildspersons felt he\nwould not be able to\ncontrol his temper. Mr\nPreece was then carried to\nthe Serpentine and thrown\nin. Despite frequent protest,\nhe was not too upset by the\nexperience and managed to\nlead a resounding\nboo malak a. No Chance of Success\nLast week the controversial\nsubject of President\nReagan's Strategic Defence\nInitiative (SDI) was debated\nin the Physics Department.\nSpeaking in favour of the\nproject were Dr Haines and\nProfessor Southwood, both\nof Physics, and speaking\nagainst were Professor New\nand Dr Moss of Physics\nand Computing\nrespectively. All of the\nspeakers agreed that the\nso-called 'Star Wars'\nproject had virtually no\nchance of success, and that\nthe idea of a defence shield\nwhich could protect a whole nation was sheer\nfantasy. It was\nac knowle ged that there are\nother reasons why the\nAmerican military are\ninterested in pursuing this\ninitiative, among them the\nneed to support the\ndefence industry.\nThose against the project\nsaid that it should be\nvigorously opposed on\nprinciple due to the\npolitical instability which it\nhad already caused and\nwould continue to cause as\nwork progressed. Other\nworries about the project\nwere based on the\nrestrictions which might be\nput on groups in College\nfor security reasons once\nmilitary money had been\naccepted, and the worry\nthat research done in the\nname of defence might in\nthe end be used for\noffensive purposes.\nOne More\nfor the\nRoad\nActing Union Bar Manager\nDave Brennan resigned last\nweek following the theft of\nover \u00a3100 of bar takings\nwhich were in his\npossession. The money\nwas stolen at around\n2.30pm on Thursday, after\nMr Brennan had left the\nmoney poorly guarded for\na few minutes. He\nsubmitted his resignation\nafter discussing the matter\nwith Refectory Manager\nRob Northey on Friday.\nMr Brennan was on his\nway to deposit the takings\nin the safe in Beit Arch\nsecurity office, after locking\nup the bar. He stopped\nbriefly in the games room\nto speak with a friend and\nleft the money on a shelf,\nin a sealed plastic bag,\nhaving removed it from his\npocket to get out a packet\nof cigarettes. A few mint u es later he noticed that the\nmoney had disappeared. Mr\nBrennan immediately\nchecked the money had not\nbeen picked up by any of\nthe Beit security guards or\ncleaners, and then alerted\nthe Sherfield security office\nand Assistant Refectory\nManager Martin Parsons.\nMr Parsons and Chief\nSecurity Officer Geoffrey\nReeves rang the police at\n2.45pm. Mr Brennan was\ninterviewed by police on\nFriday. He told FELIX that\nthe police were chiefly\nconcerned with discovering\nwhether he had taken the\nmoney himself. He agreed\nthat the theft had been\nlargely a result of his own\nnegligence, but expressed\nsevere displeasure over the\nattitude the police had\ntaken. They had thought it\nunusual that he had\nborrowed a sum of \u00a350\nfrom College as an advance\non his wages earlier in the\nweek.\nMr Brennan spoke with\nMr Northey later on Friday.\nMr Northey expressed no\nill-feeling towards Mr\nBrennan but explained\nsympathetically that he\ncould not overlook the loss\nof the bar takings. Mr\nBrennan was given the\nchoice of resigning or\nbeing sacked, and chose to\nresign. He is now working\nin the refectories.\n5 11 December 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Where to go\nThe majority of European ski resorts are in\none of the 'Big Four' ski countries: Austria,\nSwitzerland, France and Italy. There are of\ncourse many other countries where you can\nski\u2014package tours are available to Spain,\nAndorra, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, and it's also possible to ski in Norway, West\nGermany, Greece, even Czechoslovakia and\nRomania. Of course you can also ski in\nScotland, but unless you live nearby it isn't much cheaper than a package tour to the\nalps, and the weather and skiing aren't anywhere near as good.\nLeaving aside the more unusual\ndestinations, let's consider the characteristics\ntypical of resorts in each country.\nAustria\nThere was a time when skiing holidays were\nsynonymous with Austria. The country has a special un define able atmosphere which means\nthat, despite the increase in popularity of\nother countries, Austria is still the most\ncommon destination for British skiers. The\ntypical resort is a small village with a dozen\nor so ski-lifts and good skiing for beginners\nand intermediates. There is an increasing\ntendency for neighbouring resorts to share lift\npasses with the skiing areas linked by\ninterconnecting lifts or ski buses. The\nreputation of the ski-schools is very high.\nSince the villages were there long before\nskiing became a form of recreation, they have\na life of their own, unlike the soul-less\nFrench ski stations. There are also a few\nlarg ish towns which act as ski resorts,\nnotably Kitzbuhel and Innsbruck. The\nubiquitous a pre s ski is the best there is\u2014the\nAustrians know how to enjoy themselves and\nhow to make their visitors feel welcome. For\na good all-round holiday, especially for\nbeginners, Austria takes some beating.\nHowever, its skiing is often at comparatively\nlow altitude and may fail to provide sufficient\nchallenge and scope for the more advanced\nskier. Other minus points are the high cost of\nliving in Austria, compounded by the lack of\nalternatives to hotel or pension\naccommodation\u2014 self-catering is almost\nunheard of in Austria.\nSwitzerland\nLike Austria, one of the traditional ski\ncountries. Resorts do tend to be larger than\nAustrian ones, and suffer some of the same\nlimitations\u2014a single cable car from the\nvillage to the slopes, or ski areas spread out\nalong the valley some distance from the\nvillage. Swiss skiing is often higher than in\nAustria and there are some superb\nareas\u2014Zermatt has the highest cable car in\nEurope at 3880m(12600 feet) to the summit\nof the Klein Matterhorn. Facilities are\ngenerally superb and perfectly maintained.\nUnfortunately skiing in the world's most\ncivilized country isn't cheap, although some\nself-catering is available. Count on an extra\n\u00a350 on the holiday price compared with\nFrance, before you even think about the\nprices in the resort. It hurts every time you\nget your wallet out.\nFrance\nThe French pioneered the concept of the\npurpose-built ski-station, examples of which\ninclude Les Arcs, La Plagne, Courcheval, Val\ndT sere, etc. Perched high in the previously\nuninhabited mountains, they open up vast\ntracts of superb skiing terrain. Being designed\nand positioned solely for skiing, they are\nright slap-bang on the slopes with no cable-car ride up from the valley.\nAccommodation is available in hotels, but\nmost popular are self-catering apartments.\nThe most obvious advantage of this is\nOn The Piste\nSkiing holidays are becoming ever more popular and, despite being notoriously\nimpoverished, large numbers of students find their way to Europe's snow-clad\npeaks every year. For those contemplating a first trip, or choosing their own\nresort for the first time, Ramsbottom's answer to Franz Klammer, J Martin\nTaylor, tells you where to go and how.\nEarly morning skiing in virgin powder snow.\nTower block apartments at La Plagne, France\nA cable car suspended high above Cervinia, Italy\n20 11 December 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Boring But True\nIC Union has finalised\narrangements for the initial\ntakeover of the Union bar.\nAt the meeting of Bar\nCommittee last Wednesday\nit was agreed that the\nUnion would assume\ncontrol of the bar on Friday\nJanuary 3 1986. Sabbatical\nOfficers Carl Burgess, Dave\nKingston and Quentin\nFontana presented the\ndetails of the first stages of\nthe takeover to Monday's meeting of council.\nThe date has been\nchosen to coincide with\nRefectory Manager Rob\nNorthey's monthly\nstock take. Once this has\nbeen completed the\nfinancial management and\nday to day running of the\nbar will become the Union's resp on sibi lites. A separate\naccount will be set up for\nthe bar and the initial float\nwill be funded by means of\na loan from the Union's own account. ICU Deputy\nPresident Dave Kingston\nsaid that he expected this\nsum to be of the order of a few hundred pounds only.\nHe explained that most of\nthe stock would be sold\nbefore it had to be paid for.\nMoney would not be\nneeded to pay for a large\nquantity of stock at the\noutset. Some of the bar\nsurplus will be fed back\ninto the Union's own\naccount by introducing\ncharges for management\nand administration. Mr\nKingston and Mr Burgess\nalso in tenu that profits from\nthe bar be set aside for\nrefurbishment of the\nLounge bar area and the\nbar itself.\nUntil the Union has\nobtained its own licence,\nbar staff will be recruited in\nconsultation with Mr\nNorthey and Mr Iwen\nThomas, who will remain\nthe licence es. At\nWednesday's Bar\nCommittee Mr Northey\nadvised the Union Officers\nto appoint a bonded\nbarman as manager.\nMr Kingston said on\nMonday that the\nSabbaticals had been\nlooking out for a bar\nmanager for the last few\nweeks, but that no\nappointments could be\nmade until Council had\nagreed to the detailed\nproposals for the takeover.\nMr Northey told FELIX\nlast week that he would\nexpect that float for the bar\nto be in the region of\n\u00a35000. He also commented\nthat the comparison of the\nprofitability of the QM C and IC bars, as reported in\nFELIX on November 29,\nhad been highly misleading\nsince the QMC prices were\nsubstantially higher.\nThe first joint paper by\nMr Burgess and College\nSecretary John Smith was\nnot included on the agenda\nfor governing body on\nFriday, following Mr\nBurgess' request that ICU\nCouncil should first\napprove the document. The\npaper had been passed at\nthe meeting of House\nCommittee on November 6,\nbut Council later instructed\nMr Burgess to ask that it be\ntemporarily withdrawn. Mr\nBurgess and Mr Kingston\nare hopeful that Council\nwill be able to agree any\namendments in time for the\npaper to be re-submitted to\nHouse Committee on\nMarch 5.\nNearly 400 people, including Professor and Mrs Ash and\nCollege Secretary John Smith, saw Dramsoc's production\nof Alan Ayckbourn's 'Bedroom Farce' last week.\nAbove; Sarah Johnson gets her chance to polish Ciaran\nHassett's bald patch.\nFaulty Finances\nHamlet Gardens residents\nare complaining about a mistake by Student\nServices Finance Officer,\nDave Parry, that means that\nthey have recently received\nadditional bills for this\nterm. The students say that\nthey have not budgeted for\nthe extra rent.\nMr Parry forgot to bill the\nresidents for the Christmas\nvacations, when he sent out\nthis term's bills at the start\nof term. He also billed\nsome students living in\nsingle rooms as though\nthey were living in doubles.\nMr Parry said that\nStudent Services would\nwait for payment until the\nstudents could afford it. He\ncriticised the students,\nthough, saying they should\nhave known how much\ntheir rent was. He also\nwarned third year students\nthat their degrees would be\nstopped if they didn't pay\nby the end of the year.\nComfortable\nChemistry student Andrew\nHealey was 'fairly\ncomfortable' in Charing\nCross Hospital on Monday,\ntwo weeks afer he was\nadmitted with Thallium\npoisoning.

    "content": "The ICOrg\"\"\nFELIX has been the newspaper of Imperial College since 1949. In that time it has developed\nfrom a tatty broadsheet Into professional newspaper. In the last 36 years it has reported on\neverything from new halls to President's streaking ar round the Albert Hall. In a special feature\nJane Spiegel describes the work required to produce FELIX every week.\nFELIX first came out in\n1949 as an alternative to\nthe Phoenix. Since then it\nhas developed from a 'sheet' to the weekly\nstudents newspaper of\nImperial College.\nToday, the paper has a permanent staff of three\npeople. Firstly, there is the\neditor, Hugh Southey this\nyear, who is elected on an\nannual basis and has\nsabbatical status. Then\nthere are Tony, the Printer,\nand Rosemary, the Typesetter. The rest of the\nI FELIX Staff is made up of a random assortment of\nstudents from a wide cross-section of the College.\n1\nNumbers fluctuate from\nabout twenty to thirty. The\namount of involvement and\ncontribution of individual\ntime vary considerably.\nThe paper is completely\nindependent of the Union.\nIn effect, this means that\nthe editor has the final say\nin the paper's content and\ncannot be dictated to by\nUnion Officers or College.\nObviously, there are the\nlegal obligations regarding\nsuch matters as libel and\nobscenity.\nFolding\nBefore describing the\ngoings-on in the FELIX\noffice, it may be necessary\nto explain a few terms,\nwhich will crop up\nrepeatedly, for everyone\nunfamiliar with the process\nof producing a printed\npiece of paper.\nSome Jargon:\u2014\nOriginal copy\u2014scraps of\npaper with illegible scrawls\non them which accumulate\nin unseemly little heaps all\nover the place.\nTypesetting\u2014converting\nthe written material from\nthe original copy into a typed form ready for\nprinting.\nProof reading\u2014 checking\nthe typeset for spelling,\npunctuation, margins, size\nof type etc.\nPasting up\u2014 chopping the\ntypeset into little bits and\nglueing them onto a piece\nof paper (extremely messy).\nThis is then imaged onto\nan aluminium plate which\ngoes into the printing\npress.\nFolding\u2014 loading,\nunloading and watching the\nfolding machine and\nhoping it won't chew up\ntoo many pages.\nCollating\u2014 sitting at a table\nputting the pages into each\nother, end result\u2014FELIX\nwith all pages in the correct\nsequence.\nFELIX is divided into a number of different\nsections. Responsibility for\ncertain pages, such as,\nNews, Arts, Reviews, Sport,\nand What's On is given to\nindividuals. Often it is the\nsame person who is in\ncharge of a given section\neach week. Normally, they\nwil ask other people to\nwrite parts of their page or\npages. However, it is up to\nthem to ensure that their\nsection is typeset, proof\nread and pasted up in time\nfor printing.\nProof reading is always\ndone by someone other\nthen the writer. Most items\nare proof read at least\ntwice by different people.\nThis is done by whoever is\nin the office and isn't doing\nanything else at the time.\nThe pasting up of Clubs\nand the What's On Diary\ngets foisted upon anyone\nwilling to do them.\nWhenever there is an\nevent on in College or\noutside which could be of\ninterest to students,\nsomeone is sent out to\ncover it. This can be a debate, talk, play, meeting,\ngig etc. Since the FELIX\noffice also has several\ncameras, a keen\nphotographer will also be\ndespatched to try and get\nsome interesting pictures.\nThough, depending on the\nevent, this may not always\nbe possible. The films are\ndeveloped by FELIX Staff\nthemselves.\nThe existence of the\nFeatures section and the\noccasional appearance of\nOpinions and Specials\ndepends very heavily upon\nindividuals. The editor\nkeeps a file with ideas and\nsuggestions for features.\nSome of these are planned\nweeks in advance and\ninvolve a great deal of time\nand effort on the part of the\nwriter. Compared to many\nother student newspapers,\nFELIX has a large number\nof articles relating to\nscientific matters. It is\npresumed that, as Imperial\nis a College of Science and\nTechnology, this will be\nagreeable to the majority of\nits readership and cater for\ntheir interests.\nOccasionally, every now\nand then, rarely, an opinion\narticle is handed in by\nsomeone who has no\ninvolvement whatsoever\nwith FELIX. These\nextremely rare items are\nreceived with great\nexcitement and are always\npublished (basically, it\nmeans the staff have a page less to panic about).\nSo, anyone out there who\nhas an obsession, a passion, a need to put pen\nto paper or just an axe to\ngrind\u2014all donations will be\ngratefully received.\nThe deadline for Letters,\nClubs, Societies, What's On, Small Ads and Sports\n(except Final Results) is on\nMonday at 1.30pm. This\npart of the paper relies\nentirely on members of\nCollege handing in their\noriginal copy (those scraps\nof paper). Predictably (?), it\nseems to be always the\nsame Clubs and Societies\nwho present items for\ninclusion. This is a shame,\nespecially since this\nCollege has such a large\nand varied number of active\nclubs.\nIt should be pointed out\nthe the editor will not\naccept anything handed in\nanonymously. However,\nanyone not wishing to have\ntheir name published, only\nneeds to let the editor\nknow, and their name will\nnot appear.\n12 11 December 1985 FELIX\n\n"

When you\nbook a room, for heaven's sake read what's on the\nback of the booking form,\nand allow time after the\nevent to clear up.\nPersonal Security\nA number of people are\nhaving their property\nstolen. Quite frequently this\nis because things are left\nunattended. Don't leave\nyour bags, wallets,\ncalculators etc alone or\nyour room unlocked when\nyou are out. I came across\none case of a student who\nhad left his door wide open\nfor at least on hour. What\nan idiot!\nSecurity Guards\nThe Union Building\nsecurity guards generally\ndo a good job which is\nsurprising considering the\namount of shit they get\nfrom some idiots. People\ncause the guards no end of\nhassle when they are going\nabout their business yet\nstill expect them to help if\nit is needed. The security\nguards look after your best\ninterests. Respect them for\nthat and help them.\nChristmas\nFinally I move on to a happier note. Christmas is\ncoming up soon and no\ndoubt you still have some\npresents to get. Why not\nbuy someone a book from\nthe Bookshop or some\nregalia from the sports\nshop. Both of these shops\nare owned by you, the\nstudents, this helps you in\nthe end.\nHappy Christmas.\nDave Kingston.\nDave Kingston\nDramsoc\nFor the first time in a Dramsoc exclusive we have\na talk from the principal of\nthe re nov we ned WebberDouglas Academy, one of\nLondon's premier acting\ncolleges. So if you want to\nknow how to get into a acting school or anything\nabout the acting\nprofession, come along at\n2.30pm today, to the Lower\nLounge. It's entirely free,\nand absolutely everyone is\nwelcome.\nWine Tasting\nOn Wednesday 20\nNovember the (Wine\nTasting) Society hosted the\nIC heat of the Macallan\nJunior Malt Taster\ncompetition, a prestigious\nannual inter-university\nscotch whisky tasting\ncompetition, which was\nwon last year by one of our\nmember.\nThe event involved a talk\nand slide-show give by an\ninternationally known\ni whisky expert, Mr Wallace\nMilroy, followed by a blind-tasting of 5 malt whiskies\nwhose region of origin and\nbrand name were to be\ndetermined.\nThe heat winner was\nNick Battersby (EE1) who\nreceived a bottle of 18 year\nold Macallan malt whisky\nand goes forward to the\nnational final, to be held in\nJanaury at a top London\nHotel, there he will meet\nthe winners of 15 other\nUniversity heats.\nThe final prizes will\ninclude 6 bottles of whisky,\na substantial cash prize and\na visit to the Macallan\nDistillery in the company of\nthe Production Director.\nAmnesty\nInternational\nThe forgotten prisoners\u2014a campaign to release a prisoner of conscience.\nWho is going to defend\nyou if a totalitarian state\ndecides to imprison you\nwithout trial, tortures you,\nthreatens you or your\nfamily with violence or even\ndeath, just for speaking\nyour mind? Who is going to\nfight for the thousands of\nmen, women and children\nwho 'diss appear', murdered\nbecause they did not\nhappen to agree with their\ngovernments' opinions? In\nnearly half the countries in\nthe world, some or all of\nthese things happen. It is\nthe responsibility of\neveryone to stand up and\nfight for human rights: If\npeople do not, they are\nliable lose them.\nAt present, the IC Group\nof Amnesty International is\ncampaigning for the release\nof one such prisoner, who\nis serving five years in a 'corrective' labour colony in\nthe USSR. Ivan Starovuit's only crime was to\npeacefully exercise his\nright of freedom of\nreligious belief guaranteed\nunder article 18 of the\nUnited Nations'\nInternational Covenant on\nCivil and Political Rights\nwhich was ratified by the\nSoviet Union in 1973.\nWhile a lot of pressure\nfrom a ten persistent\nindividuals can be very\neffective in improving the\ncondition of prisoners like\nIvan, government e respond\nmuch more when many\npeople write in to complain\nabout human rights abuses\nagainst particular\nindividuals. For this reason\nthe IC group of Amnesty\nInternational is launching a campaign to get everyone\nin College to write one\nletter to the Ukrainium\nauthorities, mentioning\narticle 18 and asking for\nthe re ler ease of Ivan\nYakoulevich Starovoit. It\nneed only be a short letter.\nIf you want to find out\nmore about the case before\nwriting an information\nsheet can be obtained\neither from the FELIX\nOffice, Union Office or by\ntelephoning Charles\nPenman 5777.\nAddress for letters:-Ukrainskaya SSR\ng, Donetsk\nOblastnaya Prokuratura\nProkuroru\nSki\nTwo weeks running an J article by the Ski\nClub..well, after our\ntremendous success at the I last dry-slope-race, we are I all psyching-up for the next |\nevent (Mid-January).\nHowever, our first team is\ndesperately seeking a female skier of reasonable\nability interested in racing 1\nand winning.\nCould any girl interested\nplease contact Martin S Steber (Comp 2) via the\nPigeon holes.\nModel Aircraft\n'Hey, Shei, you seen this?'\n'What is it, Bobby?'\n'ICMAC want to wish\neveryone a Merry\nChristmas and a Happy\nNew Year\u2014even us in the\nClose'\n'Isn't that nice\u2014look\nespecially those who have\npaid their membership\nsubscription.'\n'Look, Shei, why don't we\nget Karen and Damien\nmembership for\nChristmas\u2014they'll like\nthat...\"\n'I'm sorry Tom, you have\npower, wealth\u2014everything I could possibly want, but\nICMAC have more to offer\nme'.\n'Heather, I can get you fuel,\nthird party insurance and\neven a six-channel\ntransmitter\u2014just marry me'.\n'I don't need your help\u2014I want to try to fly by\nmyself..'\n'Hey, Harry, look\u2014'ICMAC\nwish everyone a Merry\nChristmas'\u2014that's nice'.\n'Huh!

Many\nnews items originate from a rumour or a garbled\nversion of something which\ncould have happened, but\nthen again perhaps it\ndidn't. This term has been\ndominated by the\ncontinuing saga of the\nUnion Bar. The process of\ncovering this story is not\nvery different from any\nother item which is\nconsidered to be\nnewsworthy. A lot of time is\nspent telephoning people\nwho never seem to be in. If\nthey are in, it can be\nextremely difficult to get a coherent answer to\nquestions. At other times .\nwhen a budding reporter is\nsent out to speak to one of\nthe 'stars of the story',\nconflicting replies are\nbrought back to the office.\nHowever, most people are\nvery helpful when it comes\nto answering ques it ions.

    "content": "Sabbatical Games Pic.\nPresent\n\"haven'ta clue do The Great Incompetence Game\nMomentous happenings are afoot at Imperial Manor. Head Butler,\nGovernor Smith has agreed that one room in the manor can be\ntaken over by one of his staff. Six people are in the running:\nReverend Burgess, Miss Kingston, Gruppenfiihrer Fontana,\nSergeant Northey, Professor Anderson and Space Commander\nLehman. Eight rooms are under consideration and there are six\npossible items which could be placed in the room by the\nsuccessful applicant: a case of sherry, a rape alarm, the Mines\ncoffee machine, a pizza-oven, a blackboard and a particle-beam\nweapon. Governor Smith has already made up his mind but hasn't told anyone what he's decided. The object of the game is to\ndiscover which combination of person, room and article has been\nselected, so that the owner of Imperial Manor, Emperor Ash, can be\ninformed of the decision.\nAny resemblance between this game and another well-known\nboard game is entirely coincidental. However the rules are pretty\nmuch the same. For those unfamiliar with them the rules are\nsummarised below.\nThey are twenty special playing cards to go with the game\nrepresenting the six persons, eight rooms and six articles, which\nare printed on a separate sheet of card inserted in FELIX. You will\nalso require a counter for each player and a dice to play.\nVariations on the basic rules can be used as desired. For\nexample, after the Reverend Burgess has entered the Bar he\nsubsequently moves diagonally from side to side. If fewer than six\nplay, Miss Kingston and Gruppenfiihrer Fontana can safely be left\nout \u2014 this does not affect the game in any way.\nRules\n1. Each player (two to six can play) chooses one of the six characters and places a token on\nthe appropriate starting square. Each player also needs paper and pencil to make notes against\na list of the rooms, persons and articles appearing on the cards.\n2. The cards are separated into those representing rooms, persons and articles and one of each\ntype is selected (unseen by any player) and placed in an envelope. The remaining cards are\nshuffled together and dealt out face down to the players. Some players may have a card more\nthan others \u2014 such players have a slight advantage.\n3. Players move around the board from their starting positions on the throw of a single dice.\nMiss Kingston plays first, followed by players to the left in turn. Tokens must be moved in\nstraight lines (not diagonally) and may not land on or pass over occupied squares. Players may\nenter rooms only through the doors marked on the board, but an exact throw of the dice is not\nnecessary. However, any unused dice units are lost on entering a room and the move ends. Any\nnumber of players may occupy a room at the same time.\n4. Each player attempts to discover the correct combination of room, person and article\ncorresponding to the cards hidden in the envelope. Cards in the player's own hand can, of\ncourse, be eliminated immediately. In order to eliminate further cards players enter one of the\nvarious rooms where they can suggest a possible combination. For example, a player who\nenters the Bar may then, on the same turn, make a suggestion using the words \"I suggest that\n(Reverend Burgess) has gained control of the Bar and will install the (Mines Coffee Machine)\".\nBrackets indicate that any other article or person (including those chara ter s not in use by any\nplayer if less than six are playing) can be substituted as best suits the player's enquiries. The\nroom, however, must be the one that the player's token is in at the time. While making the\nsuggestion the player moves the token representing the person named into the room where the\nsuggestion is being made. It is not replaced after the suggestion, the player whose token it is\ncontinues to play from the new position.\n5. After a player has made a suggestion the player to his/her left examines the cards in their\nhand. If they have one or more of the cards corresponding to the room, person or article named\nin the suggestion they must show one to the player making the suggestion. They should not\nshow the card to any other players. If they hold more than one of the appropriate cards they\ncan show the one of their choice.\n6. If the first player to the left of the one making the suggestion does not have any of the three\ncards named then he/she must say so and the enquiry moves on to the next player, and so on.\nAs soon as the player making the suggestion has seen one card, however, the turn ends and no\nfurther enquiries are made or cards shown.\n7. The player who made the suggestion will thus see one card held by another player which can\nbe eliminated from his/her enquiries. But players can deduce further information from the\nsuggestions of others and their movements on the board. In addition, players may make\nsuggestions including a room, person or article for which they hold the card in their own hand.\nPlayers should take care not to show their cards to other players, and deliberately peeping at\nother players' cards is definitely not on.\n8. Players do not have to throw the dice on their turn, they may choose to stay in the room they\nare in for as many turns as they wish or they may use the secret passages marked on the board.\nOnce the dice is thrown, however, a move must be made. Only one suggestion may be made\nper turn and once it is made a player may not then move on that turn. Movement, either by the\nthrow of the dice or via the secret passages, must be made before any suggestion.\n9. If after a suggestion is made no other player poses ses any of the cards named, then the\nplayer making the suggestion has either found the correct combination of cards or has one or\nmore of those named in his/her own hand. If the latter applies the player does nothing and play\ncontinues as normal. Otherwise the player opens the envelope and checks the cards inside. If\nthe suggestion is not correct after all then one of the players has overlooked a card in their\nhand and deserves a good bollo king for ruining the game. If the cards in the envelope are those\nnamed then the player making the correct suggestion is the winner and should seek an\nimmediate meeting with the Rector to put forward their suggestion.\n\n"

    "content": "Yes, it's that time of year\nagain. Not only is it the\nseason of good will, but it\nis also the season of peak\ncinema attend en ces in\nBritain and as such the\ntime for the distributors big\nreleases, often big summer\nhits in America (summer\nbeing their peak time). This\nfilm is not one held over\nfrom the summer, it's the\nhighly seasonal Santa\nClaus, the Movie (Odeon\nLeceister Sq). (The movie\npresumably being added to\navoid confusion with any\nother Santa Claus).\nThis 'movie' is a fine\nexample of American\ncultural imperialism,\nextolling the delights of\ncapitalism, and even\nportraying Coke and\nMcDonalds as desirable\ncommodities. Santa Claus\nhimself is a large,\nbenevolent American ruling\nover a kingdom\npopulated\nto the North Pole to enable\nthem to deliver toys to all\nthe children in the world.\nBut as the population\nincreases this task\nbecomes harder and Santa\nchooses a helper, Patch,\ncutely played (as ever) by\nDudley Moore. Patch's attempts to help go wrong\nand in his self-imposed\nexile he teams up with the\nunscrupulous BZ. When\nonce again things go\nwrong, largely due to the\nevil BZ (boo, hiss!!) it is up\nto Santa Claus, Joe, an\norphan, and a nice guy, to\nsave the day.\nUnspecial Speilberg\nThe remarkable Steven\nSpeilberg has his name\nassociated with two major\nrecent releases, Back to the\nFuture, reviewed later, and\nThe Qspnies. His\nobsession with\nkids has\nby small\nsub ser vi ant British\nElves and the deprived\nchild in the story is, of all\npossible kids in the world,\na healthy, white ,\nintelligent, American child.\nThe music is often sickly\nsupermarket songs and the\nsets and costumes are\nI largely twee. That's the\nintellectual response, the\nemotional response ca sued! me to sit through the film\nI with damp eyes, a lump in\nI my throat and a stupid grin\non my face. I'm sorry Ii couldn't help it.\nThe story in this case\ni concerns a childless\ntoy maker and his wife who\nare magically transported\nfinally let him down; the\nchildren who star in this\nstory, and who are meant\nto be seen as cute, only\ncome across as annoying\nand even frequently crude.\nBecause their parents\nhave seemingly given us\nhope of saving their\ndock side homes, it is left\nup to their offspring to do\nsomething about it on their\nfinal weekend together. The\nseven saviours are: Mi key,\nthe fairly weak leader,\nBrad, his sadistic brother;\nChunk the lovable, clumsy\nfat one; Mouth, fast talker;\nDale, resourceful would-be\nJames Bond and token\nethnic minority, oh and I nearly forgot two token\ngirls, Andy and Stef, whose\nonly purpose is to provide\nthe sexist cinema\nstereotypes as the\nscreamers and the love\ninterest. (Actually that's not\nquite fair, the writers have\ngraciously allowed Andy\nsome musical ability, well I. suppose that's sufficiently\ngenteel for girls to do).\nFortunately for the\nMagnificent Seven, Mikey's father, the local museum\ncurator happens to have a treasure map in the attic,\nwhich then leads them off\non the trail for One-Eyed\nWillie's booby trapped\ntreasure and across the\npath of the baddies (Who\nare not only adult, but also\nforeign, oh dear, oh dear). I kept finding myself wishing\nthat the evil Fratelli's would\ncatch Indiana Junior and\nthe assembly of goons.\nA scene early on sets the\nstandard of humour for the\nfilm when the gang\ndesperately attempt to\nreplace the genitals that\nhave broken of a small\nGreek statue. This then\nleads to more below the\nbelt jokes as the bad guys\nare repeatedly hit in that\nregion, hysterical. To\nsummarise, it I haven't \u2022 already made it clear, The\n' Goonies is neither funny\nnor exciting, and I'd like to\nthink that if it wasn't for\nSpeilberg's name it would\nnever have been made.\nSteven Speilberg has also\nproduced Back To The\nFuture, an infinitely better\nfilm about a time travelling\nboy. The problems of\ncausality, so much enjoyed\nby writers of science\nfiction, are used largely for\ncomic effect as Marty, t Michael J Fox, is\ntransported in time to 1955\nwhen his parents first met.\nThis choice of time not\nonly opens up all the\npos sibi lites of affecting the\nfuture, but also allows for\nsome interesting Freudian\nideas as Marty's mum\nfancies him.\nNo time like the present\nThe comic ramifications of\nthis situ t ation are\neffectively, but not\nexcessively, exploited and\nthe final climax is very\nexcitingly portrayed by\ndirector and co-writer\nRobert Zemeckis\nThe particular pleasure of\nthis film is the balance;\nbetween character acting\nand believable reaction,\nand between the credible\nand the incredible.

    "content": "would someone go into\nSanta's Grotto to see?), he\nburst into tears, did a180 degree turn, and ran\nbawling back into the folds\nof his mother's coat. It can\nbe difficult enough to stop\na young boy from crying,\nwithout being prevented\nfrom communicating with\nhim by a fake set of white\nwhiskers and an ill-fitting\nwig.Later, after a little\nadvice from Eric, I coped\nmuch better with my\nsecond cryer. Give them\nthe present, start the\nconversation and keep it\ngoing, on your own if need\nbe. Natural curiosity soon\nsurfaces (why does he look\nso funny?), and soon\nenough they'll be telling\nyou what you ought to be\ndropping down their\nchimney.\nAgain another pause.\nYou can't get out a book,\nor have a quick game of\ndarts during these lulls, you\njust have to drum your\ngloved fingers against the\narms of the comfy chair.\nNext was a group from a nursery school, 15 of them\nlining up in their little blue\npom-pom hats - some\nbrash, some not, one\ncrying, and two teachers\nstraight out of Joyce\nGrenfell record. They sang\nme We Wish You a Merry\nChristmas and I shook\nthem all by the hand.I liked\nthat bit especially.\nSometimes the children\nwere outgoing and\nextrovert, their parents\nstanding well back. I could\nsit them on my knee, talk to\nthem, ruffle their hair;\ngreat. 'Thank you Father\nChristmas', after I gave\nthem a gift, 'Merry\nChristmas Father\nChristmas'. 'Merry\nChristmas Nicola', I'd say.\nSome were less sure,\nlooking at their mother and\nhiding their face in their\nhands. All the children\nthanked me for the gift,\nthough some required a little prompting from their\nparents.\nFCs work one hour on,\none hour off (it says so in\nthe Elf and Safety at Work\nAct), so it wasn't long\nbefore John knocked on\nthe plywood of the grotto\nwall. I waited for a pause\nand then darted into a side\ndoor, with John appearing\nseconds later to resume the\ntask... I removed the\nwhiskers and asked Eric\nhow I could improve. My\nmain problem was\nconfidence, or the lack of\nit, as Santa is supposed to\nbe big, bouncy and\nbombastic. Even though I was not nervous my lack of\nconfidence in my ability\nsometimes showed,\nalthough at first when he\ntold me this I was surprised\nthat anything could show\nthrough the nylon whiskers\nthat covered 85% of my\nface.\nMy spare hour was spent\nlooking round the toy\ndepartment at some of the\ntoys I had been asked for.\nMost were TV advertised,\nmade of plastic, and\nexpensive. Not a single\nchild had asked for a board\ngame, or a train set;\nstrange. My hour as a sabbatical Santa passed\nquickly, and soon I was\nback in the whiskers. I thought that being wrapped\nup in all that rig would\nmake me hot, but this was\nnot the case, although if\nthe grotto was full of\npeople then presumably the\ntemperature would rise\nconsiderably. However I have a genuine (non-nylon,\nnon-removable) beard, and\nmaybe FCs with no facial\nhair of their own find the\nwhiskers less easy to wear..\nAs my confidence rose I felt I became a better\nperformer: 'Do you know\nwhat reindeer eat?', 'My,\nyou have a nice red scarf\non'. One little girl even\nkissed me.\nI gave one little chum the\nwrong sex present, but Eric\nwas on hand to do a swap.\nThen, as I got into the\ngroove, Eric left, and I was\non my yo-ho-own as the\nchildren crept, strolled and\nran into my Grotto, though\nnone attempted to pull my\nbeard. Surprisingly I never\nonce felt that the parents\nwere being dragged into\nthe grotto unwillingly. If\nboth parents were there\nthen they typically stood\nholding hands, grinning, as\nI told little Martin what it\nwas like to live at the North\nPole. Once or twice I got\nhints from the parents what\nto say. Some parents\nwanted me to give more\nspecific guidelines on the\nsphere y of behaviour upon\nwhich modi fic a ion must be\nenacted, prompted and\nmouthed, about going to\nbed on time or eating\ncauliflower. I was asked if I was going to be at a particular school party. The\nparent nodded furiously,\nand so I felt confident in\nsaying that, yes, I would be\nthere.\nAnd what were the\nclients like? The age range\nI had to deal with was from\n8 months right up to 11\nyears. Obviously those of 8\nmonths didn't get much\nmore than a hairy grin and\na present, but some older\nchildren didn't have english\nas their mother tongue, and\nI felt rather helpless as they\nlooked up at me, expecting\nme to say something. After\nall, a Father Christmas who\ncouldn't speak English\nwould have confused me\nwhen I was seven. Soon\n(maybe too soon) my stint\nwas over. I returned to\nnormality by removing the\nred coat and white beard,\nand trotted round the\ngrotto entrance where I chatted to Santa's friend\noperating the till at the\nentrance to the grotto.\nThey do get occasional\ncomplaints that the teddy\nbears don't play very festive\ntunes, but I was pleased to\nfind out that no-one had\ncomplained about my\nconduct, though one\nmother had commented\nthat I did look rather young\nfor a Father Christmas. As\nEric has a daughter older\nthan me, and John is\nretired I suppose that my\nonly-slightly-older-than-teenage looks don't quite fit\nthe bill. Just wait until I get\na nice long white beard\nthough, and I 'll be first in\nthe queue for jobs next\nChristmas.\nW*4 You could say that chain\nstore Santas are a cynical\ngimmick reinforcing the\ncapitalist consumer ethic in\nimpressionable children.\nYou might even believe it.\nMore fool you. I don't think\nthat the Le Grot de Santa\ncomes even close to\nmaking a profit for\nDebenhams once all the\noverheads have been added\nup, but they aren'ta charity, and I guess that\nthey believe that it justifies\nitself in the increased toy\nsales. However I believe\nthat this is at the expense\nof other stores, and doesn't arise from children putting\nmore pressure on their\nparents for more expensive\npresents. I certainly saw no\nsigns of anguish on parents\nfaces when their pride and\njoy reeled off a long list of\nwants, though I don't know\nwhether it was because the\nparents had cool y decided\nnot to get little Crispin a full size slate bed billiard\ntable or they thought that\nthe \u00a31500 was quite\nreasonable for a Christams\npresent. Things might have\nbeen different in this\nrespect if I had been a santa in Liverpool instead\nof Harrow.\nFC at Debenhams,\nHarrow, provides a good\nservice. Surely only a real\nScrooge would deny\nchildren and their parents\n10 minutes in Santa's Grotto once a year?. Merry\nChristmas..\nFELIX would like to thank\nSanta Eric, Santa John and\nall of the gnomes and\nfairies at Debenhams.\n11 December 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Sex Appeal\nDear Editor,\nIn a whole issue of FELIX\ndedicated to sex, I was\nrather disappoint d to see\nthe rather marginal is ed way\nin which homosexuality\nwas dealt with I also felt\nthat the subject was treated\nsomewhat inaccurately and\nlacked sensitivity.\nPrejudice against\nhomosexuals does not, as\nyour authors suggest, 'stem\nfrom grossly misleading\nimpressions gained from a small proportion of the gay\ncommunity'. It stems from\nthe fact that we live in a society which consistently\nsuppresses and distorts the\nimages of lesbian and gay\nlifestyles, and from the fact\nthat our society does not\nvalidate any alternatives to\nheterosexual, reproduction\norientated sexuality.\nWhat in my opinion the\narticle fails to put across is\nthe sense that being gay in\nLondon can be a most rich\nand varied experience and\nthat despite the problems\nof being 'out' in an\nessentially traditional and\nmale-dominated\nenvironment such as IC,\nmuch support and\ncompany can be gained\nfrom getting involved in the\norganisations that exist. No\nmatter how unsure or\nun confident you are about\nyour sexuality groups such\nas ours provide a framework for you to\nexplore your feelings. I would like to welcome\nanyone along to our\nThursday meetings at ULU\nin Malet Street, WC1.\nIt is ironic that, in an\narticle intended to\nrepresent homosexuality in\nthe 'sex special', there is no\nmention of lesbians\nwhatsoever. If it is hard for\nmen to come out at IC due\nto the male-dominated\nmales atmosphere, the\nproblems for lesbians must\nbe greater. Failure to even\nacknowledge their\nexistence only serves to\nreinforce the difficulties\nfaced by lesbian women\nand to re confirm the way\nthat straight men\nconsistently fail to realise\ntha women can be\nhomosexual too.\nI look forward to a more\npost ive and constructive\nrepresentation of lesbians\nand gay men in your paper\nin the future.\nyours,\nJonathan Sheldon\nChairperson ULU Lesbian\nand Gay soc\nVan Mail\nDear FELIX,\n(This letter had to be\nwritten in a very short\nspace of time to meet the\nFELIX deadline. Please\nexcuse its brief and maybe\nconfusing nature).\nAt the end of October\nBalloon Club asked\nQuentin to book a Budget\nvan for the weekend of 30\nNov/1 Dec since all Union\nvans had been booked out.\nA simple enough task(?) Q replied 'No need to book a Budget, I can let you have\nthe 17 seater green minibus\nby swapping with other\nclubs'. Leaving the task in\nQ's hands I go away\nfoolishly thinking all will be\nwell for our late November\ntrip and organise all the\nother fiddly bits one needs\nto.\nAs Nov 30 draws closer I go and check with Q that\nBC will definitely be able to\nuse B97 OLE (the green\nvan). 'YesT\n, says Q 'The\ngreen van will be yours,\ndon't worry'. I check with\nCaving Club on Weds 27\nNov (the original booker s of B97 OLE) to make sure\nthey know of the changes\nQ has planned. Of course,\nCaving knows nothing of\nQ's plans, but are\nagreeable to doing a swap\nanyway since they can\nmake do with a smaller van.\nOn Thurs 28 Nov, with\nonly one day to go until the\nweekend, Q tells me\nMountaineering must take\nthe green van and we will\nhave to make do with a Budget van.\nConfused by now? I was\nbewildered! On the\nmorning of Friday 29 Nov I call Q to check we have a van. Q says, 'Yes, I 've got\nyou a transit, but not a Budget one.' This sounds\nominous! 'You will have to\ngo to Old Kent Road to\nfetch the van I 've booked\nyou'. By now I had realised\nit was definitely going to be\n'one of those weekends'.\nLater, on Friday\nafternoon after a two hour\nexpedition across half of\nLondon to fetch the van I discover Ford have brought\nout a new type of Transit\ndisguised very cleverly as a VW Van. Being much\nsmaller than a Ford Transit\nwe just managed to\nsqueeze the balloon into\nthe van and off we go.\nJust outside London, on\nthe M1 the water\ntemperature gauge shoots\noff into the red. The AA\nman comes to our rescue\nand d is over s a faulty\ntemperature gauge. Off we\ngo agains determined to\nenjoy our weekend. Luckily\nwe had no more trouble\nwith the van apart from the\ndrivers windscreen washer\nthat did not work.\nConclusion\nBalloon Club asked\nQuentin to book a van four\nweeks before it was\nneeded. We were left\nwondering which van we\nwould end up with and it\nwas Rugby club who used\nB97 OLE on 30 Nov/1 Dec\nso goodness know what\nMountaineering or Caving\nused as transport.\nI wasted four hours\ncollecting and returning the\nvan. A van which delayed\nour journey and, in my\nopinion, was an awful thing\nto drive.\n\u2022 Which club will the\nphantom van swap per strike at next? It could be\nyour club.\nMike Carpenter\nBalloon Club Chairman\nQT\nDear Mr Thomas,\nI would like to take the\nopportunity, on behalf of\nQT Soc, to reply to the\ncriticisms you voiced in last\n(week's letters page. It is all\nto easy to sit back and\nmoan about something you\ndon't like; rising up off your\nbackside and doing\nsomething positive about it\nis considerably more\ndifficult. Even so here is an\nopportunity for you to do\nso.\nAs you would have\nrealised, if you had actually\nbothered to read the QT\npieces, the society accepts\narticles from anyone \u2014\nincluding non members. In\nfact we are currently\nholding 'write for QT'\ncompetition. The best\nsubmissions will be\npublished in FELIX.\nWith the sense of humour\nyou displayed in your letter\nand your well thought out\nideas, it seems strange that\nyou have not yet submitted\nan entry. However I look\nforward to receiving your\nsubmission with\nanticipation on a similar\nnote, if you are unhappy\nwith the contents of FELIX,\nthere is nothing to stop you\nmaking your own\ncontributions to the\nnewspaper.\nYours sincerely\nWR Goodwin\nChristmas Wines from IC Cellar\nAs is our custom at this time of year we are able to make\none or two offers to you from the cellar.

    "content": "Hockey\nAshford 0 IC 1sts1 The first half saw IC\ndominating the midfield\nand excellent moves down\nthe right wing created\nmany chances. However\nthe attack, led by goal-shy\nJustin 'Bullet' Brooking,\nfound the finishing touch\nelusive. The defence played\nsuperbly and achieved the\nremarkable feat of\nconceding no short\ncorners. Special mention to\nPaul Smith's stopping\nability which stood out\nfrom the rest of the\ndefence. In the second half\nIC threw everything\nforward desperately\nseeking the winner. Even\nJon Stonham meandered\ninto the oppositions 'D' before resisting the\ntemptation to shoot. In the\ndying seconds, Ian Parker\nshowed a momentary flash\nof brill ance and scored a blinder.\nIC 2nds0 Harrow Town 3\nThings looked grim for the\nSeconds when HTS turned\nup having gained 13 points\nfrom 15 in the league so\nfar. They looked much\nworse when the opposition\nmanaged to go one up in\nthe first 7 nanoseconds of\nthe game.\nNot to be deterred by this\nvery early set-back the\nSeconds promptly gave\naway a penalty! However,\nthe gods of chance smiled\nbenignly down upon team\ncaptain Phil Choudhury\nwho pulled off a somewhat\nfortunate save. The ball\nricocheted off various parts\nof his body in a vaguely\nrandom order without\nencroaching over the goal\nline.\nThroughout the game the\nSeconds seemed to be at a bit of a disadvantage in so\nmuch as certain members\nof the team found it very\ndifficult to stop the ball\nThis was in fact due to\ncertain gravitational\nanomalies in the curvature\nof space. These\nphenomena were\nparticularly in evidence\naround the region of spacetime occupied by Jim\nWard. It appeared that\nwhenever a Hockey ball\nentered this zone at a fairly\npedestrian vel6 city it\nunderwent an infinite\nacceleration whilst its\nvolume shrunk to zero. This\nwas apparently the reason\nwhy Jim found it almost\nimpossible to stop the ball.\nCross\nCountry\nHockey\nSaturday 30\nMiddlesex League\nMens\nAshford 0 IC\nIC 2nds0 Harrow Twn\nULU League\nLadies\nIC 1sts7 St Georges\nFriendly\nSt Georges\nAHS S4 IC\nSunday 1\nFriendly\nMixed\nIC 3 Goldsmiths\nBadminton\nFriday 29\nCup\nIC 10 Chelsea\nFootball\nSaturday 30\nULU League\nLSE1 sts2 IC\nIC 2nd s0UCH LSE3 rds0 IC\nIC 6th s0 Inst of Ed\nGuys1 RS M1st s133 rds01 sts1 sts4 th s Football\nLSE 1sts2 IC 1sts3 IC got back to winning\nways beating LSE for the\nthird time in competitive\nmatches this season. With\nconditions very slippery\nunderfoot it was always\ngoing to prove hard for\ndefences with the LSE\nkeeper having a first half he\nwould want to forget. With\nLSE reduced to 10 men\nafter a sickening clash of\nheads (Lawrence Covill 3\nstitches, LSE defender 6\nstitches) IC began to make\ntheir one man advantage\nplay, controlling the\nmidfield and playing one\ntouch football.\nIC's first goal came when\nthe LSE Keeper was\ndeceived and wrong-footed\nby Tom Dutton's20 yard\ndrive. A second was added\nwhen full back Chris\nEngberg joined the attack,\nagain beating the LSE\nkeeper at the near post\nfrom the edge of the box.\nLSE's subst it ue finally\nappeared at half time and\nthey came out a rejuvenated side pulling\none back after 10 minutes.\nIC regained their two goal\nadvantage almost\nimmediately with Tom\nDutton firing home from 18\nyards for his second goal\nof the game.\nWith 15 minutes\nremaining a goal mouth\nscramble following a corner\nled to LSE again pegging\nback the defeat to one\ngoal.\nWater\nPolo\nAfter a high spirited trip to\nBristol, the Imperial\nCollege water-polo squad\nstarted their first round\ntournament of the UAU\nChampionship poorly going\ndown 5-4 to Surrey\nIn the second game\nagainst Southampton\nUniversity IC played to\ntheir full potential putting\nin four goals before half-time. In the second half\nseveral substitutions were\nmade with Johnston\nreplacing Eastman, Mayall\nreplacing Richardson and\nJackson and Crowther\ngoing in in place of\nLangman and Davis\nrespectively. The final\nscore in this confidence\nboosting game was 11-2\nwhich reflected Spooner's wise decision to rest his\ntired first seven players.\nThe crucial game of the\ntournament for IC was\nplayed against the other\nfavourite team, Bristol\nUniversity. Paul Richardson\ngave away an early goal\nbut vindicated his place\nwith some solid defending\nlater in the first half. Strong\npressure from IC resulted\nin a73 win with goals from\nNigel Williams, Nick Ireland\nand Eastman.\nWith this hard match out\nof the way a win against\nBath University was\nrequired to qualify as\nleaders of the regional\ngroup and this was\nobtained with a40 result.\nMidway through the\nseason, the Cross-Country\nclub are maintaining a slender lead over Surrey\nUniversity in the London\nColleges League. This is\nthanks to a good turnout at\nthe last race at Shooters\nHill, where IC had enough\nfor 2 mens' teams and\n(amazingly) a full ladies'\nteam. Bryan Gamblin ran\nwell to finish 9th and the\nrare appearance of Paul\nBrooks-Johnson and\n'mega star' Mike James\nensured a solid first team\nperformance. Sue Waters\nran well again in the ladies\nrace, which also featured\nthe IC orienteering captain\ngetting lost!\nAt the Stag Hill relays, IC\ncame a very creditable 4th, just failing to beat\nUniversity of London. In\nthe recent GLC championships, the IC\nCaptain and bar race world\nrecord holder, Jon Lea,\nmanaged to get us\ndisqualified before the\nstart.\nSee the noticeboard for\nnext term's fixtures, which\ninclude the Hyde Park\nRelays and terminate (sic)\nwith the Holland trip.\nBadminton\nIC 10 Chelsea 1\nTrying our best to ignore\nthe rain dripping on to the\nside of the court, the mens\nsingles with Philip (Tan)\nagainst the (legendary) JK\nWong (Chelsea) got under\nway. This turned out to be\na very good game, indeed,\nwith superb badminton\nfrom both sides, but with\nHK Wong just managing to\nwin eventually 12-15, 15-3,\n15-12.\nUnfortunately for\nChelsea, their brilliant start\ndidn't last long. IC ladies\npolished off their ladies\ndoubles to win all 3\nrubbers. The men followed\nsuit winning all 3 men's doubles, and the mixed\ndoubles were won by IC.\nSo, the final result was a101 victory for IC, putting\nthem into the 2nd round of\nthe KO Cup, where they\nwill meet LSE on Saturday.\nTeam: Ladies: Robin\nMartin, Sarah Threadgold,\nHelen Gregory, Susan\nYates.\nMen; SL Tan, Bhorat\nPopat, Dave Heaps, Steve\nFrancis.\n26 11 December 1985 FELIX\n\n"
