Whilst I understand\nthis viewpoint, there is a piece of legislation coming in from the EU that is\npretty much sheer insanity; which will\nalmost certainly destroy our \ufb01nancial\nservices sector and deepen any future\nrecessions. I know everyone dislikes\nbankers these days but I can\u2019t help\nbut feel we might miss the substantial\namount of GDP and tax they contribute once the EU has decimated what\nwas once the jewel in the British economic crown.\nOf course, I am discussing the proposed cap on bonuses. I believe the\nonly reason this suggestion has actually got through is because to anyone\ninvolved in the industry and to British\npoliticians, it was so utterly ludicrous\nnobody gave it a second thought. For\nthose unaware, the EU is proposing a\n1:1 cap of variable:\ufb01xed income in a\nbanker\u2019s pay (i.e. your bonus is capped\nat 1x base salary). here is a clause to\nallow for 2x base salary with shareholder approval, which I would be astonished if any banks fail to get.\nIn my mind, this is a bow to populism with very little thought put into\nthe damage it could do. Or possibly,\nin the case of Germany and France\n\u2013 long embittered by having to pay\nthe downside of our risks whilst we\nreap all the bene\ufb01ts \u2013 a great deal of\nthought put into the damage it could\ndo. Essentially, the reason this won\u2019t\nwork is because it\u2019s aimed at reducing total compensation. I would be\namazed if that happens.\nAn investment bank (I\u2019m talking\npure corporate advisory at the mo-ment) is a human capital-intensive\nbusiness. heir only expenditure is\ntheir employees. As such, why on\nearth wouldn\u2019t they give as much as\nthey possibly can to their employees?\nIt makes economic sense. he purpose\nof a public company is essentially to\ngenerate value for their shareholders.\nIf they don\u2019t pay out as much as possible of revenue to the bankers who\ngenerate the money, what are they going to do with the rest? hey could sit\non it in a large cash pile; that screams\nA defence of banking\u2019s most controversial practice: bonuses\nincompetent corporate governance.\nhey could invest it\ninto the company to\ndrive up the stock\nprice. hat would\nbe good. hat is exactly what they do\nby paying their best\nbankers generously.\nhey are investing\ntheir capital in the\nmost e\ufb00ective way\npossible. Consequently, the chances\nof them substantially reducing compensation are pretty\nmuch nil. his is not\ngood.\nLet\u2019s say we have a\nrock-star managing\ndirector. He brings\nin over \u00a3100m a year\nin fees, so consequently gets a \u00a3600k\nbase salary and\n\u00a39.4m bonus. here\nis no way an advisory \ufb01rm would let\nthis employee go if\nhe continues to per-form. Consequently, they will end up\npaying him a \u00a35m\nbase salary, which is\npure insanity. Let us\nnow propose there\u2019s\nanother recession.\nhis company has\nmany similar rockstar MDs (they only\nhire the best). Sadly\nnow there\u2019s no business to go around,\nno matter how good\nyou are at making\ndeals. Previously,\nthe bank\u2019s intrinsic risk management\nsystem \u2013 and yes, that is e\ufb00ectively\nwhat bonuses are \u2013 would\u2019ve kicked\nin. he \u00a39.4m bonus would\u2019ve been\naxed, the MDs could all have kept\ntheir jobs and continued contributing to the economy, albeit at a lower\nrate. If the bank has a \u00a35m \ufb01xed cost,\nthey cannot do this. A large proportion of the MDs would have to be \ufb01red\nfor the business to remain pro\ufb01table.\nNot only would this destroy corporate\nvalue in the long term (if you don\u2019t see\nhow this a\ufb00ects you, imagine what it\nwill do to your future pension if all\n\ufb01nance equities slide 70%); it would\nalso make the recession that triggered\nthis scenario an incredible amount\nmore severe.\nI personally think the sane answer to\nthe compensation question for bankers who work in risky divisions, such\nas debt packaging (or, you know, trad-ing: that division whose sins bankers often have attributed to them), is\nbail-in able bonds. Cap cash bonuses\nat 1x base salary, sure: that\u2019s de\ufb01nitely\na good idea, as high cash bonuses do\ntend to encourage reckless risk taking.\nBut allow bankers to have a higher\nvariable payment than this in the form\nof bonds that will be the \ufb01rst port of\ncall when the company needs a bail-out. Keep the heady compensation,\nas much as it angers the populace,\nbut make these bankers the \ufb01rst port\nof call when it hits the fan. Maybe, if\nthe bankers were aware the majority of their compensation was up for\ngrabs if their actions turned out to be\ntoo risky and have a negative e\ufb00ect on\nthe bank, nothing would ever hit the\nfan. Or, you know, you could just cap\nall bonuses and drive up \ufb01xed costs.\nIn this scenario, who will be responsible for taking the \ufb01nancial burden of\nbailing out the banks when it all inevitably goes wrong again? hat\u2019s right \u2013\nyou, the taxpayer, not those dastardly\nbankers who caused all the trouble in\nthe \ufb01rst place.\n\u201c\nThe reason\nthis won\u2019t\nwork is\nbecause it\u2019s\naimed at\nreducing total\ncompen-sation. I\nwould be\namazed if\nthat happens.\nW\nAaniya Ahmed\n\n"

Evelyn Gardens\nare the way forward for now until you\nfind a better alternative to North Acton.\nIn an ideal world Evelyn Gardens would\nbe kept on as halls for the foreseeable\nfuture. If there needs some redoing on\nthe inside, then that is something that\nneeds to be done. Some are better than\nothers. In particular, I remember Willis Jackson basically being fine. I really\nenjoyed it and didn\u2019t for a minute think\nit was not a pleasant place to be. Students want halls that are near by, not\ntoo expensive, obviously not run down\nbut they don\u2019t need to be a palace.\nThis is what students want from halls:\na bed, wardrobe, access to a shower\nnear by, washing and drying machine\nfor clothes, a kitchen, and to be near\ncampus. That\u2019s it. Luxury and everything else is nice, but students would\nrather be close in a less well furnished\nhalls that is affordable, then further\naway in a better furnished halls. That\u2019s\nthe too long didn\u2019t read summary, and I\nthought I\u2019d put it up at the front.\nUnfortunately,theNorthActondevelopment looks pretty close to being set\nin stone. We own it now, and it would be\nhard to back out. If College were willing\nto, I would shave my head. (Wait, hang\non, if they do I can back out right!? If\nyour reading this Sir Keith, I would hate\nto shave my head, so maybe you can\nreverse it just out of spite towards me?)\nSo what can be done to make things\nright? A great, and difficult, question.\nWell, perhaps we could become landlords to other students? Particularly\nthose whom the development is more\nsuitable to? Perhaps we could turn\nthem into apartments for young professionals and rent them out? That\nway Imperial won\u2019t lose money, and a\nnew commercial interest would be developed for the College. Don\u2019t know if\nany other universities do this, or if this\nis even a possibility. Maybe it sounds\nlike a daft idea, but why not? Loads of\ncompanies own space and rent it out.\nWhy couldn\u2019t Imperial. Could be a nice\nalternative stream of income to the ailing HEFCE money.\nWhat definitely isn\u2019t set in stone is\nEvelyn Gardens and Garden Hall. We\nshould stall for as long as we can to try\nto extend the lease.\nNow, unless their heads have all been\ncollectively in the sand, they will have\nheard the opposition to North Acton\nfrom the Union during the discussions,\nand, soon enough, after taking one\nlook at this paper, will see the opposition from students. It\u2019s amazing to see\nso many students speaking up and\nspeaking out about this; a big factor\nCOMMENT #AgainstActon ARTS\nParagon nightmare Show your support Actually vintage\nComment have pumped out a\nwhole 8 pages of stuff.

Felix apologises for this error.\nH\nfor this being incredible to see is that\nit is a decision that won\u2019t affect current\nstudents, and so I am genuinely incredibly excited that so many are actively\nspeaking out against something to\nstand up for other people (in this case\nfreshers who have not yet arrived).\nNow to explain the main reasons for\nbeing as against as possible to humanly be to the North Acton move. This is\nas detailed as I can be in the space pro-vided.\nThe distance to South Kensington\nis way too far for freshers. This really\nis the headline concern. It\u2019s possible\nto write a very lengthy piece on just\nthis. It\u2019s going to be about 40 minutes\neach way (I\u2019m being generous). I don\u2019t\nknow about you, but in your first year\nespecially that feels very far away. It\u2019s\nenough to make you not want to bother\nwith lectures. It\u2019s enough to make it\nreally annoying getting home after a\nlong night in the Library/on campus. It\nis close to the new campus, which is\nbeing built, but, as Paul so beautifully\nput it, there aren\u2019t going to be any undergraduates using that new campus.\nNorth Acton is just too far to travel everyday to and from campus. You want\nhalls to be close and essentially a crash\npad near campus. You want to be able\ntocomebackafteranightoutandsleep\noff the hangover while still being able to\nget in for lectures. When you\u2019re working\nlate in the Library, you don\u2019t want a long\nordeal to get home. You want to be able\nto get back soon.\nThe price, once you include travel\ncosts, will still in all likelihood be more\nexpensive than just getting a house in\nFulham (like most second/third years\ndo Lillie Road/Ongar Road anybody\n\u2013 come on, everyone knows someone who has lived in that eight person\nhouse). Besides, whom would they get\na house with and when would they get\ntimetohuntandgetone\u2013justtwoconcerns with that. Even if private accommodation were an option, halls is a special and unique opportunity to embrace\nuniversity life, make friends, enjoy your\nyouth, and have a great student experience (I believe that is the catchphrase\neveryone uses nowadays). Saying it is\nin a price band is intentionally mislead-ing. If I said I am going to charge you\nbetween 50p and \u00a350 for a bottle of\norange juice, you agreed, and then I\ncharged you \u00a345 you would rightfully\nsay you\u2019re being duped into accepting a\nbad deal. While we talk about the price,\nit is worth mentioning students want\ncheaper halls near campus. They do\nnot care much about furnishings. Being near campus and in halls that isn\u2019t\ngrotty is enough.\nEvelyn Gardens will likely be closed\nand turned into something else. This is\na travesty as these halls were amazing.\nI lived in Willis Jackson, and my older\nsister also lived in EG. They were both\ngreat halls that the vast majority of people look back on with fondness.\nAnother thing that is very annoying\nin all of this is the lack of honesty and\nopenness from College. Due to it being\ncommercially sensitive, nobody that\nknew were allowed to say anything\nto anyone (least of all say anything to\nFelix). I do not blame them for not leaking as they would have been breaking\ntrust and confidentiality agreements;\nit would not have been hard to identify the source of the leak. Yes, it would\nhave been a great, bold move to do\nso. It would have allowed students to\nbe fully informed of everything before\nCollege Council had made a decision.\nThen everyone would have been able\nto show their dissatisfaction early on.\nThe fact that they had silenced everyone until now, when the decision is\nfurther along the line, is a very cynical\nmove indeed. It means they can\u2019t see\nthe student reaction before the decision is made. This allows them to tell\nstudents that students were consulted\nbefore they properly consult students.\nI would like to end by saying that I really must commend Paul for his efforts\nbehind the scenes on this. Him (and the\nUnion) have really fought the corner on\nthisone.Nowgetoutthereandgetyour\nviews heard!\n\n"

    "content": "\u201c\nAnonymous\nMy Paragon Nightmare\nwas fully prepared for the dif\ufb01culty of the \ufb01rst year. I was\nprepared for the step up in\nterms of work and di\ufb03culty\nof the course. I was prepared\nfor the task of \ufb01nding new friends all\nover again. I was even prepared to live\nalone and take care of myself. I was\nnot however, prepared to \ufb01nd myself\nalienated from a lot of other \u2018freshers\u2019 by being shoved into Paragon.\nAll the other di\ufb03culties of a \ufb01rst year\nare just common ground; everyone is\nin the same boat. For the students at\nParagon, being there meant being in\na completely di\ufb00erent boat altogether.\nhe location is the obvious main\nproblem with the halls. Every morn-ing, I wake up two hours before my\n\ufb01rst lecture, just to have enough time\nto get ready and take the 40 or so minute journey into South Kensington.\nWhile no changes are necessary, it is\nfar from a comfortable journey. Being\nthe \u2018Heathrow\u2019 tube, it is often \ufb01lled\nwith tourists with in\ufb01nite amounts\nof luggage, and coming from the pe-riphary of London, it is the prime tube\nfor many commuters. If you throw in\nthe fact that we have to make the journey during rush hour, it all adds up to a\ncramped and uncomfortable journey,\nwith a seat being nothing less than a\nmiracle. In all honesty, after a term\nof these terrible mornings, I\u2019ve sadly\ngrown used to them. Near the beginning of the year the journey always felt\nlike it was over an hour, excruciatingly\nlong. Now , however, I don\u2019t notice the\n40 minute journey, all I notice is the\ndi\ufb03culty of getting out of bed so early,\nespecially knowing that several of my\nclassmates in \u2018regular\u2019 halls get up 15\nminutes before a lecture and casually\nstroll in. he only thing worse than the\ntravel in the morning, is the travel back\nin the evening. If I \ufb01nish at 5 or 6, I get\ncaught in the rush hour, and as a result end up holding my breath for the\nnext 40 minutes so I\u2019m not crushed by\nthe surrounding commuters, or their\nluggage. Whereas some students go\nback to their room between lectures\nor for lunch, we cannot even consider\nsomething like this. If you include the\nwalking either side, there and back\ntakes up two hours of your day. It\u2019s a\nhighly alienating feeling, knowing that\nvery few of your classmates have the\nsame problems you do. Besides the\nvast inconvenience of the journey, the\nprice of travel is extortionate. Our student loans obviously do not take this\ninto account, so while I was prepared\nto live on a student budget, I was not\nprepared to also throw in \u00a3117 per\nmonth for Zone 1-4 travel (some people pay \u00a390 for zone 1-3, or less for\nzone 1-2, although this is far more\ninconvenient). Budgeting becomes a\nwhole new beast as you can\u2019t let yourself go skint and live on cheap noo-dles, you have to have enough to travel\nto your lectures. It stretches even further for nights out, surely the most\nexciting prospect of being a student.\nShould we want to go out, we either\nhave to go out in the surrounding area\n(Brentford and Ealing) which, at best,\nseem sad and nothing like the London\nmost of us dreamed about living in,\nor we make the tube journey (at least\n40 minutes, more for central London\nand other popular places), which usually makes \u2018predrinks\u2019 redundant.\nhroughout the entire night I \ufb01nd myself looking at my watch and thinking\n\u201cshould probably go home soon.\u201d his\nis simply because the only way to get\nhome after the tube stops running is\na night bus, which is at least an hour\nand a half, and requires pre-planning,\ndue to the fact that it only runs from\ncertain stops (once you\u2019ve had a drink\nor two, Googling the way becomes far\nharder). his challenge has crushed\nmy desire to go out and party: it\u2019s just\ntoo much hassle every time. Surely no\nother fresher faces this problem. he\nsurrounding area of Paragon (Brent-ford) is very dreary and depressing.\nhe only upside is how close the corner shop is, at it is pretty much outside\nthe Paragon gate. Looking at the area,\nit feels nothing like London and not\nsomewhere one wants to live. It houses a small industrial park and a small\nand depressing high street.\nhe long journey begins to seem all\nthe more pointless when on some days\nyou only have 1 or 2 lectures (worse\nstill when you have a large gap between them). Finding the motivation\nto go in in these situations becomes\nharder and harder the longer into the\nterm you are, as a result work su\ufb00ers,\nprobably the worst side e\ufb00ect of imperial choice of Paragon. his is also\na problem on regular days, as after a\nlong day of lectures and travel, you\nusually have no energy for revision or\nproblem sheets, let alone coursework.\nhe halls themselves are quite mod-ern, more so than many halls at other\nLondon universities and other halls\nat Imperial (forgetting Eastside and\nSouthside). Every \ufb02at has a large communal kitchen (shared by 8) and each\nroom has its own en-suite. While an\nen-suite is a great luxury, it\u2019s diminished by the fact that we have the\nworst showers possible. hey spray in\na wide arc that goes around you, forcing you to either dance around to get\nhit by water or use some DIY skills and\nattach half a bottle to the shower head.\nhe rooms themselves are equipped\nwith everything you could need, but\nalso come with a bed which is both\nshorter and narrower than a standard\nsingle bed. Some of the taller students\nhave mentioned that at night, they\nhave to sleep curled up almost into a\nball. We have a decently sized laundry\nroom, but not large enough considering the sheer number of students from\nthe other universities at the hall (UWL\nmainly). he common room is a separate building shared by all of the different blocks of Paragon, and is very\npoorly equipped. here are two pool\ntables, which more often than not\nhave the balls stolen, a broken television and more light and open space\nthan anyone can \ufb01nd a use for. he\nfew attempts that have been made to\nutilize this space for parties have been\nnothing short of depressing.\nhe \ufb02at structure has its own prob-lem. Every \ufb02at has a door which can\nonly be unlocked by an occupant of\nthat \ufb02at. Whereas in another hall you\ncould wander up a \ufb02oor to see your\nfriends there, we must \ufb01rst bang on\nthe \ufb02at door hoping and praying our\nfriends will hear us. his structure\nserves to just further the feeling of iso-lation: not only are we isolated from\nthe rest of imperial, we\u2019re isolated\nfrom each other as well.\nOne thing I must commend though,\nis the e\ufb00ort by our wardening team\n(perhaps not our Head Warden),\nwho have done what little they can\nto make this place more comfortable\nfor us, and more social. heir ongoing e\ufb00orts are, and always will be ap-preciated.\nA Paragon of\ndisregard for\nstudents\nI was fully\nprepared for\nthe difficulty\nof the first\nyear ...

For 2013 marks the\nbeginning of free trade negotiations\nbetween the EU and the US.\nSo why should you care? Free trade\nagreements are about removing\nbarriers between nations. Quotas,\nwhich limit the amount of imported\ngoods, and tari\ufb00s, which serve as an\nimport tax, are set in place to bene\ufb01t\nlocal manufacturers and businesses.\nImported goods are in\ufb02ated in price,\ngiving the consumer incentive to buy\nlocal.\nWhile these protectionist measures\nkeep local unemployment down,\ntrade barriers do more harm than\ngood, especially for the consumer. In\na free market system the lowest priced\ngoods are the ones that win out. his\neither destroys the competition or\ncauses them to change their game and\nadapt to the situation at hand.\nhe late Soviet Union serves as a\nrather extreme example of the evils\nof protectionism. After its economic\nboom in the 50s, centralized planning\nand resource managing meant that\nthere was no incentive for industries\nto modernize. Extreme limits on\nimported goods meant there was no\ntangible competition. As a result of\nthis and other factors the economic\nstagnation of the 70s and 80s became\na harsh reality.\nAs the example of the Soviet Union\nillustrates, protectionist measures\ndo provide for some short-term\ngains, but as a long term economic\npolicy they only serve to handicap.\nOnly direct competition could\nallow for continuous modernization\nand relevance in a global trade\nenvironment.\nhis is why you should care. he\nEU and the US represent the largest\neconomies of the world. he two\nrepresent nearly half of the world\u2019s\nGDP and 800 million people.\nNegotiations could come linking\nEuropean ties with NAFTA (North\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement), an\nagreement between Canada, the US\nand Mexico. If such an agreement was\nsettled, the economic bene\ufb01t would\nbe enormous. A research institute in\nMunich found that if a comprehensive\nagreement is reached then living\nstandards in both the US and the EU\ncould rise by more than 5% by 2030.\nTrans-Atlantic trading could treble.\nhis would also include standardizing\nsafety rules, competition laws and\ntechnical procedures.\nBut money isn\u2019t everything.\nhe negotiations could be serving\na political purpose as well. his\npotential union would serve as a\ncounterweight of the rising in\ufb02uence\nof ACTFA (ASEAN-China Free Trade\nAgreement), which links Southeast\nAsian economies to China\u2019s growing\nclout.\nBut not all are convinced. Some\nview the negotiations as too good to\nbe true. here is already the usual\nmuttering of losing jobs in both the\nUS and the EU. his talk will get\nlouder as the negotiations get closer\nto fruition. However, unemployment\nconcerns have always \ufb01gured into free\ntrade talks. he long-term realities of\nan agreement are simply that more\njobs are created than lost.\nhe more troubling concern for\nthese negotiations comes from\nthe side of the EU. Ratifying any\nagreement of such calibre will most\nlikely require every country\u2019s approval.\nFor export driven economies, such as\nGermany, the target will be a broad\nand comprehensive agreement. he\nreal sticking point could turn out to\nbe France and southern countries,\nespecially in terms of regulating\nagriculture. American agricultural\noutput is massive in comparison to\nsouthern Europe. Cheap, US goods\nthreaten the livelihood of southern\nEuropean farmers. Health and safety\nlaws di\ufb00er as well: the spectre of\nGM foods will likely rear its head in\ndiscussions.\nhe other complication lies with\nthe US. If negotiations stall for longer\nthan two years, a comprehensive EUUS trade agreement will be a hard sell\nfor Obama. He might then turn his\nRiding through Europe\nhe horse meat scandal is revealing\nthe intricacies and complexities of the\nEuropean food industry. When disconcerting discoveries were made in Ireland in November 2012 and \ufb01nally the\nscandal erupted in the UK mid-January,\nno one expected it to blow up in such\na dramatic way. Since then, three separate supply chains, 13 countries and 28\ncompanies have become involved in\none of the largest food crises since BSE.\nhe scandal looks like it might even\ntake an international turn, with products being removed from supermarkets\nin Hong Kong.\nhe \ufb01nger pointing dance has begun.\nSuppliers in Romania are being accused\nby French companies of mislabelling\ntheir meat. Following the discovery of\nhorse meat in school meals, the UK\ngovernment and FSA are at a loss. 2,501\nDNA tests were run by a watchdog and\naninvestigationhasbeguntodetermine\nwhether the government was warned\nabout this two years ago. Financial\npressures on the food industry to drive\npricesdown,theimpactoftheeconomic\ncrisis leading to horse owners sending\ntheir animals to slaughterhouses and\nselling the meat are all factors leading\nto the in\ufb02ux of horsemeat into the food\nchain. Ties between meat laundering,\nvarious tra\ufb03cking operations and local\nma\ufb01a have also been uncovered in the\nfraudulent supply chains. Needless to\nsay, this does not justify the scandal\ntaking place, more so it begs the\nquestion of regulation.\nhe Food Standards Agency (FSA)\ndoes not have much power. Reduced\nbudgets and attempts to make the\nindustry self-regulating means that\nstandards are enforced by strained\nlocal authorities and the companies\nthemselves.\nEuropean regulation only requires\nthe distributors to know the origin\nof their product. Traceability here is\nnot the issue, solely labelling. With\nproducts labelled as beef containing up\nto 100% horse meat and pig meat, there\nis a clear need to guarantee the veracity\nof the label displayed on supermarket\nshelves. With the guilty supply chains\nspanning up to \ufb01ve countries, it makes\nsense for regulation to be at a European\nlevel.\nCalls for a form of European food\nstandards and regulating agency have\ngrown louder in the midst of the\nscandal. his would be complicated\nto put in place as all 27 countries will\nhave to ratify the set of rules, and\nthen again unanimously agree on any\nchanges to come in the future. Even\nif an organisation were successfully\ncreated, it could rapidly be deadlocked\ninto bureaucracy and negotiations.\nIntegration is needed for such a body to\nfunction, a di\ufb03cult decision for Europe\nand a choice the Coalition government\nis unlikely to make.\nsamtheblackheart\nattention to establishing further ties in\nthe Paci\ufb01c.\nAs it stands to reason, an EU-US\nfree trade agreement seems somewhat\nutopic. Even with a target date of 2015.\nHere\u2019s to hoping it won\u2019t get bogged\ndown in negotiations.\nCanIndia\nIf we reach an\nagreement, can we\nseal it with a kiss?\nAlexander Soloviev Writer\nMarie-Laure Hicks Politics Editor\nThat\u2019s right, I\ntasted good in\nthat lasagna!\n\n"

Scenes of jubilation greeted the results, with tops immediately\nbeing removed and beats dropped.\nhe eight won the event over Durham\nby 7 seconds, and \ufb01nished 10 seconds\nahead of Newcastle. It was the perfect\nway to top of a fantastic weekend for\nICBC, which began on the Saturday\nwith the Beginner men in their \ufb01rst race\nagainst other Unis. here was an excellent 8th (out of 33) for the beginners 4+\nof Tom \u2018Baby, It\u2019s Cold Outside\u2019 Jones,\nBastian Winklehake, Zhehou Cao and\nNikola \u2018David Guetta\u2019 Spasojevic with\ncox Hena Begum. hese lads were feeling the pain after racing earlier in the\nday (in the eight with Karl Steevens,\nShaun Nicol, Will Joyce and Kevin Ng\nSiJie, who \ufb01nished 17th of 41), and their\nfaces show it in one of the best rowing\nphotos I have seen in a long while (see\nour website)!\nOn the Sunday, the senior squad arrived in force at a cold but remarkably\ncalm Boston RC. In the \ufb01rst division the\nIC lightweight men\u2019s four were the fastest of the day, beating all of the heavyweight coxless and coxed fours (almost\nunheard of at BUCS head).

Library. Being an\nImperial College student\nis usually associated with\nthe \u201cnerdiness\u201d stigma. If you weren\u2019t\nalready one when you got in, the general idea is that by the time you leave,\nyou will have become a super studying\nsleepless monkey.\nWhile some of us see the above\nidea as a math fact, others disagree\ncompletely. Andre Nakkurt, Imperial\nalumni and one of the founding partners of GateMe, an innovative guest\nmanagement platform, was probably\none of the latter ones. he idea of a\n\u201cdark\u201d secret world lurking far from\nthe old Library isles and cold laboratory workbenches must have attracted\nhim, either that or being sick of waiting in queues to get in his favourite\nnightclub. We decided to investigate!\nPP: You say that GateMe is \u201cinnovative\u201d\n, can you tell us what is so innovative about it?\nAN: GateMe helps clubs turn random\nguests into regular clubbers, which\nincreases their bottom line. We do\nthis using state of the art technology,\nwhich helps nightclubs understand\nthe clubbers in detail. Since day one,\nthe clubbing industry has been using\npen and paper to manage table bookings and guest lists. All these messy\npapers contain data, which can\u2019t be\nused because processing costs are too\nhigh. In comparison, GateMe runs\non any mobile device or tablet, which\nmakes it easy to use the data. Fortunately for us, the industry is catching\nonto this very fast.\nPP: Does it explore a new business\nmarket? Is it disrupting an old one?\nAN: It\u2019s all about execution and long\nterm vision at this point; disrupting an\nold market and creating a new one is a\nlong journey and the team is enjoying\nit so far. here will always be imitators\nand we\u2019re \ufb02attered by their compli-ments.\nPP: Sounds good! So who are the\nfaces behind GateMe? Is it only\nImperial alumni? Do you need to\nbe extravagant and cool to work in\na start-up? Do you really wear flip\nflops and drink Red Bull all day?\nAN: GateMe considers itself lucky,\nbecause the team has extremely good\nrapport. hree team members are\nbrothers and four have known each\nother since primary school. We have\nattracted similarly passionate and reliable people, who have helped us develop high quality software very fast.\nhe team enjoys a varied background\nfrom PwC consulting to Google and\nindeed, our developers are known to\nenjoy the freedom of \ufb02ip \ufb02ops!\nPP: When was the officially launch\nand how did you celebrate?\nAN: We had been working on our\nprototype for a couple of months\nand were often visiting clubs to get\nfeedback; at one point the positive\nfeedback started to drown out the\nnegative and we knew we were onto\nsomething. he team was pleased after landing the \ufb01rst paying customers\nand excitement grew with expansion\nfrom Estonia to London and Miami.\nEvery new paying customer warrants\na ring from our \u201chappy customer\u201d bell\n(we actually have a bell in the o\ufb03ce\nsolely for that occasion. True story).\nHowever, the team feels that \u201cthe\nEureka!\u201d moment is yet to come; it will\nhappen after we cause a major disruption in the industry and we\u2019re working\ntirelessly towards that.\u201d\nPP: Is it true that all start-ups have\noffices with grass rugs and dogs\nwalking around?\nAN: Very recently we had the honour\nof winning Seedcamp London and being chosen among the one percent of\ncompanies, who get world-class mentoring and support from the prestigious seed investment fund. An important part of that support comes in the\nform of shared o\ufb03ce space at Google\nCampus, London. Seedcamp is best\ndescribed as one large family of young\nand ambitious overachievers, in the\nbest sense of that word. he shared\no\ufb03ce is fantastic, because we can\nbounce ideas around the room and\nlearn from their experience.\nPP: What about future strategy?\nWhere do you see GateMe in 3 years\ntime?\nAN: We\u2019re currently focused on software for nightclubs and the natural\nprogression from there is towards the\nclubbers. he team works around the\nclock to become the go-to brand for\nnightlife.\nPP: Being Imperial alumni, will you\never come back? Did Imperial College Business School help you at all?\nAN: It\u2019s kind of given that the academic side at Imperial College Business\nSchool is outstanding, but my biggest surprise was the strength of internal and external events happening\nthroughout the year. I exhausted myself trying to absorb as much as possible from these fantastic events and\nthis has already paid o\ufb00. Fortunately,\nImperial College Business School\nbene\ufb01ts from a very active start-up\ncommunity; places like IC Start-up\nand Imperial Entrepreneurs are where\nit\u2019s really happening.\nhe experience far exceeded my expectations and I will remain very close\nwith Imperial. I look forward to giving\nsomething back and fortunately I have\nthe chance in a couple of weeks. As\npart of a panel for the Business Plan\nCompetition, I expect to see some\ninteresting ideas from the current\nstudents. his was a major part of my\nprogramme, which prepared me for\nthe challenges our team faced with\nGateMe later on.\nSo next time you \ufb01nd yourself waiting in a 100 meter club queue, thinking why you didn\u2019t book a table or\njoint the guestlist that afternoon,\nthink about Andre and \u201chis\u201d GateMe.\nSmile, call it \ufb01eld research and you\njust might be a step closer of becoming a serial entrepreneur!\nGateMe is available in all major\nphone/tablet app markets, but if\nyou are interested in knowing more\nabout or you think you\u2019ve got the\nskillz it takes to be part of this amazing team, drop by www.gateme.com\nto register and send these nice guys\nan email.\nE\nName not on the\nguestlist?

A\nseparate piece of video footage places\nthe child\u2019s corpse lying alongside the\nbodies of \ufb01ve dead male LTTE cadres.\nhis too, appears to have been a war\ntrophy \ufb01lmed by government soldiers\nand shows the dead men, presumably\nBalachandran\u2019s bodyguards, as having\nbeen stripped, bound, blindfolded and\nthen shot in the head.\n\u201che new photographs are enormously important evidentially because they appear to rule out any suggestion that Balachandran was killed\nin cross-\ufb01re or during a battle. hey\nshow he was held, and even given a\nsnack, before being taken and executed in cold blood,\u201d claimed the \ufb01lm\u2019s di-rector, Callum Macrae. \u201cIt is di\ufb03cult\nto imagine the psychology of an army\nin which the calculated execution of\na child can be allowed with apparent\nimpunity. hat these events were also\nphotographed and kept as war trophies by the perpetrators is even more\ndisturbing\u2026 With every month that\npasses, the evidence of systematic execution of prisoners grows. he pattern\nof apparent sexual violence against\nfemale \ufb01ghters is disturbing in the extreme.\u201d Most of the LTTE leadership,\nincluding the 12-year-old\u2019s father and\nleader of the LTTE, Vellupillai Prabakaran, were killed by the Sri Lankan\narmed forces as they advanced on rebel territory. he Sri Lankan military\nstands accused of a long list of war\ncrimes and crimes against humanity,\nincluding shooting LTTE members as\nthey tried to surrender.\nhese photos are the latest in a series\nof \u2018trophy\u2019 images and videos taken by\nSri Lankan army personnel to have\nfound their way o\ufb00 the island, including bound and blindfolded men being\nsummarily executed and naked bodies\nof female combatants being sexually\nassaulted. hey are part of the new\nevidence, due to be shown as part of\nthe forthcoming documentary No Fire\nZone: he Killing Fields of Sri Lanka.\nhe feature-length documentary will\nbe screened at the Geneva Human\nRights \ufb01lm festival. No Fire Zone, the\nculmination of a series of three \ufb01lms,\ndocuments the war crimes committed\nby both sides in the \ufb01nal stages of the\narmed con\ufb02ict in Sri Lanka.\nhe con\ufb02ict has its roots in decades\nof violent oppression and state terrorism unleashed upon the Tamil nation\nin the Northeast of the island, by successive Sri Lankan governments that\nwere democratically voted in by the\nnumerically greater Sinhalese com-munity, concentrated in the south.\nLiberal Democrats deputy leader, Simon Hughes, echoed the sentiments\nof a majority of Tamil people when he\ndeclared that the ongoing ethnic strife\nwas \u201cunarguably a genocide\u201d. It was\nout of this struggle, for the right of Tamil people to exist, that the Liberation\nTigers of Tamil Eelam (or LTTE) were\nformed and began to wage an armed\nwar in order to create a separate state,\nTamil Eelam, in the Northeast of is-land. he return to sovereignty for\nthe Tamil nation, which had existed as\nan independent entity until the entire\nisland was brought under a single administration in colonial times, enjoyed\noverwhelming endorsement by democratic means with a Tamil separatist\nparty winning an unprecedented 80%\nof seats in Tamil areas of the island\nin the 1977 Sri Lankan parliamentary\nelections.\nhe documentary follows on from\nthe \u201cPetrie Report\u201d, the UN\u2019s own\ndamning internal report released in\nNovember last year. he report criticised the UN leadership, UN Security Council and top UN o\ufb03cials in\nSri Lanka. here was \u201ca grave failure\nof the UN to adequately respond to\nearly warnings and to the evolving\nsituation during the \ufb01nal stages of the\ncon\ufb02ict and its aftermath, to the detriment of hundreds of thousands of\ncivilians and in contradiction with the\nprinciples and responsibilities of the\nUN,\u201d one extract from the report read.\nWhile the Sri Lankan government has\nstaunchly and repeatedly refused any\nkind of independent mechanism investigating the \ufb01nal months of the war,\nthe UN estimated in 2011 that at least\n40 000 Tamil civilians were killed. his\nestimate has since increased.\nhe report stated that \u201ca large majority of the civilian casualties recorded by the UN had reportedly\nbeen caused by Government \ufb01re, but\nthe UN did not present this data\u201d. It\nwent on to say that \u201cthe UN was placing primary emphasis on LTTE responsibility when the facts suggested\notherwise.\u201d One may wonder how the\nSri Lankan government would have\nreacted had the UN reported these\n\ufb01gures, and as a result, there had been\na high level of pressure on the regime\nfrom the international community. It\nis perhaps most distressing that the\ndeath of tens of thousands of civilians could have been averted had the\nUN, a body with a mandate to protect\nthose very civilians and indeed people\nacross the world, adopted a harder\nstance.\nIt is abundantly clear that the UN\nmust adopt a much stronger and more\nproactive role in the future. With the\noutbreak of full scale civil war in Syria,\nthe onus is on the UN Human Rights\nCouncil to take measures to make\nsure that justice and accountability,\nfor the war crimes and crimes against\nhumanity such as those shown in \u201cNo\nFire Zone\u201d, is provided not just to the\nTamil nation in the island of Sri Lanka, but to people all around the world.\nWith the US con\ufb01rming that they will\nsponsor a resolution against Sri Lanka\nin the March session of the UNHRC,\nwhether that resolution passes, and\nthe strength of it, will be an important\n\ufb01rst step in the UN repairing its heavily damaged credibility.\nIf you are further interested, please\nvisit no\ufb01rezone.org, the website of the\nupcoming documentary.\n\u201c\nThe Sri Lankan government has ...\nrefused any\nkind of independent\nmechanism\ninvestigating the final\nmonths of\nthe war\nI\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\n6 FRIDAY 22 FEBRUARY\nNews Editors: Aemun\nReza, Nida Mahmud\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nParagon: a case study of distance\nTim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief\nParagon halls are located in Brentford,\nabout six and a half miles from the\nSouth Kensington campus of Imperial\nCollege London, which is where most\nstudents need to be every day. he use\nof the halls is a temporary stopgap\nmeasure; the problem was caused by\nthe last minute renovation of Wilson\nHouse. hey are a shared halls: Imperial, University of West London and\nhames Valley College all share the\nspace. here are 176 rooms for fresh-ers in Paragon, each room costing\n\u00a3155 per week. his does not factor in\nthe travel cost per day that is needed\nto get into College. hey are all single\nstudy bedrooms (with en suites) and\narranged in cluster \ufb02ats of eight with\na shared kitchen.\nFelix contacted Jon Matthews, Paragon Warden, for comment. He said\nthat there \u201chave been di\ufb03culties\u201d. He\nsaid that it has \u201calways been [a case\nof] managing expectations\u201d. When\nasked to highlight the main problem\nthat there is with the halls, he replied:\n\u201che main issue is distance from College\u201d. He went on to say: \u201cstudents\nspending two hours a day are going to\nhave [a] lesser experience than those\nspending 20 minutes walking\u201d. his\nwas likely referring to Evelyn Gardens\nand other closer accommodation. He\nsaid that there were not necessarily\nwelfare concerns, but the student experience was diminished in comparison to those students in closer accom-modation. He said that the wardening\nteam \u201cdo our best, but no matter what\nevents we do, there\u2019s always that commute\u201d. Paragon does have communal space, but it is not exclusively for\nImperial. here have reportedly been\nproblems with mixing between the\nuniversities. he di\ufb00erent universities\nhave attempted to advertise events to\neach other, however, there has been\nlittle uptake so far.\nHe said that Paragon was College\u2019s\n\u201conly real option to taking in the students\u201d. he original plan was to house\nstudents in Elephant and Castle. his\nwas opposed by the Union last year.\nhere have been many problems\nwith Paragon this year. he vast majority have been due to the distance.\nMany students have tried to change\nhalls, and it is believed that there are\nup to 2-3 complaints per week about\nthe distance. he College website\nstates that Paragon is \u201cideally located\nfor students studying in central and\nwest London\u201d. However, the commute to and from College has been\nhighlighted by many students as being too long. Paragon Warden, Jon\nMatthews was asked about the travel\ntime issue. He said: \u201cDoor to door\ntravel time is about one hour. Times\nthat I do take the tube, can get back\nin 45 minutes, but that is with perfect\nconnections. Realistically, looking at\nabout an hour. If one cannot a\ufb00ord to\nbe late [i.e. exam], I would say add 15\nminutes on to an hour just in case.\u201d To\nmitigate this problem there is a shuttle bus available to South Ealing on the\nPicadilly Line. However it is \ufb01ve days\na week and not run by Imperial; Paul\nNoke, Head of Residential Services\nand GradPad, previously told Felix\nthat College \u201cpay a small contribution\nto allow our students access\u2026 to the\nshuttle busses\u201d. Although there are\ntimes in the morning when students\nParagon, described on the University web-site as: \u201ca high-quality,\naward-winning, purpose-built hall\nof residence with excellent transport links and good shopping and\nleisure facilities available\u201d, has been\na source of quite some controversy\namongst Imperial students. Sounds\nidyllic, so what\u2019s the problem?\nPrimarily it\u2019s the distance. With\nthe closest tube station located in\nzone 4 of the Piccadilly line, the 40\nminute commute to university is\ngruelling, especially for a 9am start.\nAfter a 10 min bus journey there follows the challenge of pushing one\u2019s\nway onto a central bound train.\nUsually there are no free seats, so\nwe stand. Even so, it is not uncommon for it to be so crowded that\nwe are forced to wait for the next\ntrain. Paragon is situated so far out\nthat the underground runs above\nground. Now that is saying some-thing; so much for \u201cexcellent transport links\u201d.\nSecondly it\u2019s the location of the\nactual Hall of Residence. Situated\nin Northfields, Brentford, I find it\nmisleading to promulgate the shopping and leisure facilities in this\narea. When I look out of my flat win-dow, I have an excellent view of the\nGlaxoSmithKlein headquarters as\nwell as the M4. Maybe I\u2019m being unfairly critical; it does have its perks.\nBesides from tall buildings and cars\nthere is also a Petrol station, a Co-op\nand a local Fullers pub!\nFinally Paragon is impractical and\noverpriced. Due to its location there\nis no way of oscillating between\nHalls and South Kensington during the day. This means two things:\npacked lunches and long days. Once\nyou\u2019ve left Paragon, you\u2019re committed to staying on campus.\nThis leaves you with the choice\nof either become a hyper-efficient\nexpert in time management and\norganisation; or quite the opposite.\nMany decide to not go in for lectures in the first place. After all, they\nare recorded, sparing you a 1 \u00bd hour\ncommute that day.\nWith summer exams coming up\nand the university work load building up the \u201cParagon Paradox\u201d is\nbecoming ever more transparent to\nus. It is safe to say that I write this\non behalf of all Paragon Residents,\nwho are all equally frustrated with\ntheir living conditions and the blatant unfairness of our situation. The\nincontrovertible truth: Brentford,\nMiddlesex is not South Kensington,\nLondon.\nHopefully this article will call into\nquestion the plans to develop a new\nundergraduate hall of residence,\nW3, in North Acton.

The fact\nthat Lee managed to create\nsomething that is more than\nwatchable for two hours from\na book that was essentially\nwritten off as one that could\nnever become a \ufb01lm is a\nremarkable achievement.\nWhy it won\u2019t win:\nYes the special effects may be\nmarvellous and so might its\ncinematography as well as its\nediting and soundtrack. This\nhas very good chances with\nthesecategories,butthe\ufb01lmas\na whole remains too abstract,\nphilosophical, ambiguous and\ninaccessible to become a big\ncrowd-pleasing winner.\nLincoln\nNumber of nominations: 12\nWhy it will win:\nLeading the Oscar race this\nyear is Steven Spielberg\u2019s\nLincoln that has scooped\nup the highest number of\nnominations. Spielberg\ncertainly found himself an\nexcellent, committed cast to\nplay the many iconic roles, and\nhisdecade-longresearchseems\nto have paid off in recreating\ntheera,takingoneofAmerica\u2019s\nfavourite Presidents, who\nabolished slavery, bringing\nhim to the big screen. As\nintelligent, informative as it\nis entertaining, this certainly\nclicked with the audience,\nhaving bagged 100 million+\ndollars already in the States.\nWhy it won\u2019t win:\nSpielberg is no doubt a big\nname in Hollywood, but\nhas oddly only won the Best\nPicture... once.\nSilver Linings Playbook\nNumber of nominations: 8\nWhy it will win:\nWith a whopping number of\nacting nominations (FOUR \u2013\none for each acting category\n(Bradley Cooper, Jennifer\nLawrence, Robert De Niro,\nJacki Weaver) \u2013 the \ufb01rst \ufb01lm to\ndo so since Reds in 1982), plus\na director nod for the always\ndaring David O. Russell and\na good steady box oice run,\nthere is a chance this could be\nthe surprise upset of the night.\nWhy it won\u2019t win:\nThis doesn\u2019t exactly \ufb01t with\nthe generic Oscar Best Picture\nwinning type of \ufb01lm, looking\ntoo bright and chirpy for its\nown good. Even with tackling\nthe serious theme of mental\nillness, the \ufb01lm itself looks\nlike a quirky romantic comedy\nwith a unique twist, not like\nthe grand biopics voters are\nusually looking for.\nZero Dark Thirty\nNumber of nominations: 5\nWhy it will win:\nDelivered by the same duo\n(Kathryn Bigelow, Mark Boal)\nwho brought you the Oscarwinning The Hurt Locker, they\nare an expert when it comes\nto expertly crafted thrillers\nthat need no big-scale, fancy,\nexpensive action but relies on\na solid lead performance and\ntaut narrative with a \ufb01ne eye\nfor small details.\nWhy it won\u2019t win:\nThe controversy surrounding\nthe \ufb01lm, however ridiculous,\nabsurd and off-base, can\u2019t be\ndoing the \ufb01lm any favours,\nand although the box-oice\nreceipts are looking better\nthan that of The Hurt Locker,\nths flames have largely died\ndown on this one.

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n19\nFRIDAY 22 FEBRUARY\nBecky Lane\nW3: A Welfare Perspective\nThe proposed halls will impact hugely on the welfare of students,\nargues Becky Lane\nt\u2019s the topic of the moment\n\u2013 the new halls that Imperial\nCollege London Council has\napproved in W3, North Acton. Some of you may have\nbeen following the Twitter hashtag\n#AgainstActon, seen the info about\nthe campaign on the Union website or\nread Paul Beaumont\u2019s blog post (op-posite article). I\u2019m going to assume\nyou know the basics, but here is my\nlowdown on why I think the halls in\nW3 will have some pretty serious consequences for the welfare of the students who get allocated these halls.\nPersonal safety should be a key\nconcern. In the Imperial College new\nsta\ufb00 orientation, sta\ufb00 are told not to\nwalk through an estate less than a mile\naway from the site of the new halls.\nCrucially this is an estate that students\nwould need to walk through to get to\nWest\ufb01eld. Medical students are also\nwarned away from this estate when\nbased at Hammersmith hospital \u2013 if\nCollege deems this area so unsafe, why\nlocate 700 students there who are likely to be new to London and potentially\nto England? his seems like a strange\nmixed message to me. here are many\nother personal safety issues, it will\ntake two night buses to get back from\neither the Union or Central London\nafter participating in an activity or a\nnight out. his either has the e\ufb00ect of\nputting our students at a higher level\nof risk late at night, or decreasing engagement with activities.\nOn the subject of engagement, Imperial College Union is proud of not\njust the sheer number of Clubs, Societies and Projects, but the level of\nengagement that we have with our\nstudents. We recognise that Clubs,\nSocieties and Projects ful\ufb01l many\nfunctions for \ufb01rst year students, for\nexample the overseas groups can really help a student from an international\nbackground to acclimatise to life in\nthe UK. Many students also seek peer\nsupport through their links in clubs\nwhen they are going through a rough\npatch, and maybe most importantly\nthey are fun. hey help students in\nthe high pressure environment that\nis Imperial College to blow o\ufb00 some\nsteam! I strongly feel that the average participation and engagement of\nstudents in W3 would be signi\ufb01cantly\nless than students placed in either Beit\nor Princes Gardens.\nhis is just one aspect of students\nfeeling disconnected from the Imperial College community; as the\ncommunity is South Kensington cen-tric. When moving to a new city or\ncountry, I think it is really important\nto feel part of a community to make\nthat transition more manageable. Not\nonly should we consider our students\nwho engage with the Union through\nClubs, Societies and Projects, but\nwhat about the students who rely on\nthe income from working part time\nat the Union? As W3 is being marketed as cheap accommodation, it is\nreasonable to assume that some of the\nstudents who live there may wish to\nsupplement their \ufb01nances with some\npart time work. he Union provides\n\ufb02exible part time work in its outlets\nallowing students to earn extra money\nwithout interfering on their studies.\nTwo night buses and the general distance may mean that students living\nin North Acton are unable to do part\ntime work at the Union.\nhis year, some \ufb01rst year students\nhave been placed in Paragon which is\nlocated in Brentford. Although this is\nnot the same location, the travel time\nis comparable to that of North Acton.\nI strongly believe there have never\nbeen so many students so unhappy\nwith the location of their halls. he\nCollege Tutors and academics in departments have mentioned that they\nhave had vast numbers of students\nasking to be relocated to halls closer\nto College. he main reason cited was\ntheir levels of stress due to commuting\ntimes. Spending over an hour per day\non public transport cuts into their relaxation time and students have commented that the wake up early-travel-lectures-travel-work-sleep routine has\nbeen di\ufb03cult for them. hese students\nhave also raised concerns mentioned\nin the previous paragraphs. It strikes\nme that College Council should be\nlearning from previous location mistakes made by Campus Services, not\nrepeating them.\nhere is also the fact that these students will not only be further away\nfrom the Union, but the vast array of\nservices provided by College. As I\nmentioned before, South Kensington\nis the main hub of undergraduate ser-vices, and as there is no plan to move\nany undergraduate teaching to Imperial West, it will be for the foreseeable\nfuture. herefore, in 2015, there will\nbe 700 students who may not engage\nwith South Kensington based services\nsuch as Ethos gym, the Disability\nAdvisory Service, the Counselling\nService and the Health Centre.\nhese are all resources that should be\nas simple as possible for students to\nengage with. Even though these students will be travelling to South Kensington for lectures every day \u2013 due to\ntime constraints and pressures from\ntravelling, they may be less likely to\nuse these services. It should be made\nas easy as possible for students to access the help they need and distance\nis a barrier.\nhe topic of wardening provision\nhas not yet been mentioned with respect to W3. In smaller halls it is not\nuncommon for the warden to know\nthe name of every student. With a\nteam of wardens, subwardens and hall\nseniors, the transition of moving away\nfrom home is made much more bear-able. I don\u2019t know many people who\ncould hold down a full time academic\nposition and look after (and know by\nname) 700 undergraduates. I have a\nsneaking suspicion that the wardening\nprovision will be much lower in W3,\nwhich is worrying. We know that wardens provide frontline round the clock\npastoral support for students. A front\ndesk and 24 hour security could never\nreplace or even come close to this. A\nhall is not just about stopping intruders entering, it is about fostering a safe\nspace and a community that \ufb01rst\nyear students can \ufb02ourish in. Can this\nbe achieved in a hall a substantial distance away with an impersonal feel? I\ndon\u2019t think so.\nhese are my top worries about W3.\nI am sure you have your own, some of\nthese things really do need answers\nfrom the members of College sta\ufb00\nspearheading this development. As a\nUnion our primary concern is the student experience of our members, I\nwish I could say the same of the decision makers behind this development.\n\u201c\nA hall is ...\nabout fostering a safe\nspace and a\ncommunity\nthat first year\nstudents can\nflourish in.\nDeputy President\n(Welfare)\nI\nSo tired from the commute\nhe can\u2019t even button his fly\n\n"

Personally, massive reason for coming to IC in first place was\nliving in central London, 10 mins walk from campus..*facepalm*\nUnion requests to College\n1. An Imperial affordable for every capable applicant\nRetain Garden Hall as a Hall of Residence in the College Space Master plan.\nAs the most oversubscribed Hall the College needs to realise that there is strong demand for this type of accommo-dation. A range of rooms to suit all budgets and tastes are necessary for a diverse student community \u2013 there will\nalways be some students who prefer (or can only afford) triple rooms, and so it is essential that these are retained.\nRenovations \u2013 if absolutely necessary - do not need to be of the highest specification available; students are quite\ncontent with basic specifications if it\u2019s all they can afford, and it means they are close to College.\n2. Protect Evelyn Gardens\nContinue to seek out alternative, superior solutions to Evelyn Garden\u2019s ending lease than the North Acton project.\nThe North Acton project is to be viewed as an \u2018insurance\u2019 policy should nothing else be possible, but all options of\nretaining Evelyn Gardens or finding alternative accommodation closer to South Kensington, at an affordable price,\nmust be actively pursued.\n3. Accommodation designed for education, not the other way round\nReview the whole Accommodation Strategy given the discrepancies between the Accommodation Survey 2011 data,\nthe Strategy\u2019s interpretation of that data and the backlash from students over the results of that Strategy.\nData from the survey (even if correctly used) is insufficient to build a strategy in itself. A wide ranging consultation with students and staff similar to that which is being undertaken for the Education Strategy must be followed.\nWhilst the current strategy claims to be focused around \u2018feedback from students\u2019, this cannot be the case if the\nUnion and students disagree with it. College Management should agree a methodology for this consultation with\nthe Union: asking students if they like double beds and TVs is not evidential.\n4. Good governance means a dialogue with students and academics\nHold formal consultation with students and academics on North Acton and on all future projects before committing\nto a development \u2013 whether they be accommodation related or otherwise.\nThe Union requests that the College Management responsible for this project present to all interested students\nand staff the North Acton project. All future developments should have a similar level of consultation before they\nare proceeded with \u2013 we should not have a situation where students and staff, the College\u2019s most important com-munities, are kept in the dark until actions of the College Management are complete.\n5. Recognise the true value of Wardens, not just the cost\nDon\u2019t reduce Wardening ratios any further; and retain Wardens as College staff who undertake the role alongside\ntheir College careers.\nAs the backbone of the College\u2019s welfare & social provision in halls, it is imperative that Wardening numbers are\nmaintained. Wardening provision is something that the College has been proud of for many years: this sentiment\nmust be maintained. These people make the student experience in first year \u2013 something that is certainly preferable\nover Campus Services being able to sell a few extra rooms. Financial considerations are only one aspect to be considered when planning changes.\nDuring my degree, and my Sabbatical term, I was always concerned with the prospect of future students being priced out of\naccommodation.\nThough the majority of people\nwithin the College do believe in,\nand actively support, the widening participation agenda \u2013 providing sizeable bursaries, enhancing\nscholarships etc. \u2013 it is clear that\npeople do not understand the\nnegative implication of accommodation costs.\nNo greater emphasis of this was\nthe Open Day held last spring,\nwhere potential applicants with\ntheir parents/guardians were\ntaken to see some of the most expensive (and naturally glamorous)\nrooms on offer as opposed to seeing a spread of available rooms.\nI fundamentally believe that\nall students deserve a relatively\ncomparable student experience.\nObviously we cannot give every\nstudent an apartment in South\nKensington, though some people\nwill have the means to get one, but\nensuring good proximity to University, similar durations of commutes and a halls structure that\ndoesn\u2019t encourage separation of\nthe \u2018richer\u2019 and \u2018poorer\u2019 students\nis essential. By forcing students\nwith less financial support to\ntravel for longer, thus reducing the\namount of available study time as\nAll students deserve the same experience\nwell as making it harder to go to\nand from the library will naturally\nprovide an academic advantage to\nstudents who live closer.\nThe ultimate question to ask is\nwhy Acton? If the University feels\nit must leave the Evelyn Gardens\nproperties, why aren\u2019t they considering Battersea? Not only is it\nhalf the distance away from South\nKensington but with huge prospects for the future it would surely\nbe a good place to build.\nIt is clear that the College has\nmany answers to the questions\nfrom students, both past and\npresent. What I would encourage\nthem to do is be open and honest\nto the student body. Hold a public\nmeeting and answer the questions\nof students. If they approach this\nsituation with closed doors and\nthe issuing of \u2018PR-approved statements\u2019 they will only increase suspicion and create further concern.\nScott Heath\nUnion President 2011-12\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 22 FEBRUARY\n12\nFairtrade: the lowdown befo\nWhat is Fairtrade?\now many of you drink\nco\ufb00ee or tea to get you\nstarted in the morn-ing? Or sneak a ba-nana/bar of chocolate\nto get through afternoon lectures?\nHow many of you wear clothes to\nuni? hroughout our daily life we reap\nthe bene\ufb01ts of consuming all manner\nof products made using cash crops\n\u2013 most originating in developing na-tions. Crops such as cotton from India or Brazil, co\ufb00ee from Ethiopia or\nColombia or bananas from innumerable Caribbean and South American\ncountries. And yet, many of those involved in the production process remain in poverty, strong-armed by the\npower and resources of multinational\ncorporations they work for or compete with.\nEthical consumerism is not a new\nphenomenon; increasing numbers\nof people are willing to pay more for\neveryday items in the knowledge that\nthey were produced without harming\nanything. Some even boycott companies due to unsavoury practices,\nleading many to use Corporate Social\nResponsibility as another marketing\ntool. On a less cynical note, there have\nlong been organisations and business\nmovements that have aimed to provide a good service without compromising on ethics.\nMore recently, the trend in ethical\nconsumerism has tended away from\nsimple charity to promoting initiatives aimed at developing infrastructure or economy in a morally sound\nmanner in order to provide a tangible,\nlong term contribution. However,\nmost of these e\ufb00orts \u2013 such as those\nbacked by the Rainforest Alliance or\nSoil Association \u2013 are centred on ef\ufb01cient resource consumption such\nas energy e\ufb03cient practices or sustainable agricultural methods. his\nprotects the land, but does not necessarily include the people a\ufb00ected by\nthese issues within their outlook. his\nis where Fairtrade comes in.\nhe Fairtrade mark is slowly becoming recognised the world over.\nhe bright blue and green swirls cocooning the triumphant stickman is\nthe stamp that con\ufb01rms that a product has been bought while adhering\nto Fairtrade standards (see below).\nhese standards cover a vast array of\ncategories all intended to empower\nworkers to have more control over\ntheir conditions of employ, such as:\n\u2022 All produce must be sold at a minimum price required for workers to\nearn above the minimum wage limit.\n\u2022 Working conditions are safe and\nequitable for everyone including provision of adequate health and safety\nand the right to join independent\ntrade unions to ensure their rights are\nalways supported.\n\u2022 Crops are grown in a sustainable\nmanner and without use of certain\nchemicals that could cause damage if\nreleased.\nIn practice, this means that farmers form co-operative organisations\nto collectively barter with buyers, allowing them to negotiate from a position of strength and increase the price\nat which they sell goods well above\nthe minimum. his protects farmers from market crashes elsewhere in\nthe world, and gives them access to\nmore resources from which they can\nincrease both the quality and quantity\nof their produce. In addition, the Fairtrade premium takes a small percentage of the price you pay and places it\ninto a community fund. From here,\nthe co-operatives can vote where the\nmoney is spent. his could be roads,\nschools, water, or anything else requiring investment.\nSo how did Fairtrade become as big\nas it is now? he \ufb01rst Fairtrade organisation was set up in 1987 in the\nNetherlands under the name \u2018Max\nHavelaar\u2019 and focussed on supporting\nMexican co\ufb00ee growers. From this,\nthe movement spread, and slowly\nacross Europe similar organisations\nsprouted with the UK\u2019s Fairtrade\nFoundation being in 1992. However\nstill they were very independent and\nit took a further \ufb01ve years before the\nFairtrade Labelling Organisation was\ncreated so as to \u201cunite the labelling\ninitiatives under one umbrella and establish worldwide standards and certi\ufb01cation.\u201d From here, the movement\nhas \ufb02ourished and evolved beyond\njust food and textiles. You can now\npamper your loved ones with Fairtrade cosmetics, as sold by Lush (who\nwill be visiting us during Fairtrade\nFortnight) and wear Fairtrade jewellery made from Fairtrade gold. Believe\nit or not, you can even have Fairtrade\nsex using Fairtrade condoms!\nSlowly the Fairtrade certi\ufb01cation\nprocess is moving towards certifying\nentire companies as Fairtrade rather\nthan focussing on solitary products\n\u2013 something that has been helped by\ncompanies such as Cadbury\u2019s and Ben\n& Jerry\u2019s committing to achieve Fairtrade status. his means that all products made by a Fairtrade company\ncontain 100% Fairtrade materials. In\naddition, towns and universities (in-cluding our very own Imperial College) are also earning the right to call\nthemselves \u2018Fairtrade\u2019 by virtue of the\nsuppliers they use. here still remains\na way to go in the quest to reduce\nwealth disparity in the world, but by\ngoing Fairtrade we choose to use a fair\nsystem making us one step closer to\neradicating poverty.\nAditya Narayanan fills you in on what Fairtrade entails\nH\n\n"

Who doesn\u2019t\nappreciate a good pat on the\nback? Its healthy box oice\nintake is also looking good for\nthe \ufb01lm\u2019s overall popularity.\nWhy it won\u2019t win:\nBen Affleck missed out on\nthe crucial Best Director\nnomination, without which\nthe Best Picture award can\noften be very diicult to win.\nThis kind of win hasn\u2019t been\ndone since Driving Miss Daisy\u2019s\nwin all the way back in 1990.\nBeasts of the Southern Wild\nNumber of nominations: 4\nWhy it will win:\nDebut director Benh Zeitlin\ncheekily nabbed a Best\nDirector nomination (ahead of\nKathryn Bigelow, Ben Affleck,\nQuentin Tarantino) for this\nyear\u2019s race in his breakout\nindependent feature, with his\nwonderfully magical, densely\npacked and beautiful \ufb01lm\ncreating quite the storm when\nit \ufb01rst debuted in Sundance,\nwinning rave reviews\nand attention at various\ninternational \ufb01lm festivals.\nWhy it won\u2019t win:\nIt\u2019s too indie, and hasn\u2019t been\nwinning enough during the\nrace. Again, here is a \u201cbe\ngrateful you even got the\nnomination (even more so as\na debut)\u201d type \ufb01lm that gets\nslotted in every year. And this\nhasn\u2019t made a lot of money,\nwhich is never a good sign.\nDjango Unchained\nNumber of nominations: 5\nWhy it will win:\nNow widely considered to\nbe Quentin Tarantino\u2019s best\nwork since Pulp Fiction, and\nthe \ufb01lm well on course to\nbecome the director\u2019s highest\ngrossing \ufb01lm, it would surely\nmake sense to send some\nmore Oscar love his way. It\nalso tackles the ever important\ntheme of slavery, a great sore-spot in American history, and\nit\u2019s packed with excellent\nperformances from the usual\nTarantino collaborators.\nWhy it won\u2019t win:\nNo director nomination for\nTarantino will de\ufb01nitely hurt\nthe \ufb01lm\u2019s chances. Plus, is the\n\ufb01lmtooviolent?Tooeccentric?\nToo lengthy? There are many\nreasons to love Tarantino. But\nthe exact same reasons apply\nto those who are not, and will\nnever be, his bigest fans.\nLes Mis\u00e9rables\nNumber of nominations: 8\nWhy it will win:\nIt\u2019s a large, sweeping, musical\nadaptation of one of the\nworld\u2019s favourite stage shows.\nA\ufb01lmthatbroughteveryoneto\ntears (always a massive plus),\nit\u2019s full of rousing moments\nbacked by an emotionally\ncharged soundtrack.\nWhy it won\u2019t win:\nAgain, no director nod for Tom\nHooper, which makes the win\nchallenging, and the many\nbum notes the actors hit with\ntheir live-singing they\u2019re all\nso proud of and can\u2019t seem to\nstop talking about, are bound\nto act as a negative point. And\na lot of the \ufb01lm\u2019s hype seems to\nbe resting on the individual to\ntechnical achievements from\nvarious departments, as well\nas Anne Hathaway\u2019s startling\nsupporting turn. But not for\nthe \ufb01lm as a whole.\nAmour\nNumber of nominations: 5\nWhy it will win:\nThisPalmed\u2019Orwinnerwasthe\narthouse favourite of last year,\nwith audiences warming to\nits harshly honest, beautifully\nwoven tale of love. Michael\nHaneke\u2019s unique brilliance in\ndirectorial style always goes\ndown well with viewers, and\nits bittersweet look at end of\nlife not only amazed Europe,\nbut also the U.S.\nWhy it won\u2019t win:\nForeign \ufb01lms never win the\ntop prize. Ever. (Silent-\ufb01lm The\nArtist doesn\u2019t count.) A big\nwin at Cannes means very little\nwhen it comes to the actual\nOscar race. A nomination\nin the traditionally Englishlanguage category should be\nenough of an honour. And\nwithin the States, the \ufb01lm\nhasn\u2019t been performing well at\nall with picking up awards.\n\n"

    "content": "UK LGBT History Timeline\n1102\nThe Council of London took action to warn\nthe English people of the sinful nature of\nhomosexuality.\n1541\nThe first civil sodomy law, the Buggery\nAct of 1533, making male-male sexual\nintercourse punishable by death, was given\npermanent status.\n1785\nJeremy Bentham wrote an essay arguing\nthat homosexual acts neither weaken men\nnor threaten marriage, one of the first to\npublically argue such opinions.\n1812\nFemale-born James Miranda Barry\ngraduated from the Medical School of\nEdinburgh University. He served as an army\nsurgeon overseas. He lived as a man but\non his death, was found to have a female\nbody.\n1861\nThe death penalty for homosexual activities\nwas removed, although they remained\nillegal.\n1866\nLord Penzance judged in the case of Hyde\nv. Hyde and Woodmansee that marriage\nis the union between one man and one\nwoman exclusively, providing legal precedent\nagainst future same-sex marriages.\n1936\nBritish athletics champion Mark Weston\nmade the transition from female to male.\n1954\nAlan Turing, an English mathematician\ninstrumental in the development of computer\nscience, committed suicide, after being\ntreated with female hormones following his\nprosecution for homosexuality.\n1956\nThe Sexual Offences Act was passed,\nincluding for the first time crimes of\nhomosexuality between women.\n1967\nHomosexual acts between two men over 21\nwere decriminalised in England and Wales,\nbut remained illegal in Scotland until 1980\nand in Northern Ireland until 1982.\n1970\nThe case of April Ashley, a transsexual\nwoman, set legal precedent that transsexual\npeople could not change their birth\ncertificates, and could not legally marry.\n1988\nSection 28 was passed into law, prohibiting\nschools and local authorities from teaching\nthat homosexuality is an acceptable form of\nrelationship. Sir Ian McKellen came out live\non BBC Radio 3 in protest of the act.\n2001\nThe age of consent for gay men was made\nequal to that for heterosexual partners.\n2003\nSection 28 was repealed, and employment\nregulations made it illegal to discriminate\nagainst gay, lesbian and bisexual people in\nthe workplace.\n2004\nThe Gender Recognition Act gave\ntranssexual people legal recognition as\nmembers of the sex appropriate to their\nchosen gender, rather than their sex at birth,\nfor all purposes including marriage. The Civil\nPartnership Act gave same-sex couples the\nsame legal rights and responsibilities as\nheterosexual spouses.\n2009\nAn act was passed giving lesbian parents\nand their children equal treatment under the\nlaw.\n\n"

    "content": "MUSIC\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nFRIDAY 22 FEBRUARY\n40\nerzbow is widely\nregarded as the\nbiggest name in\nnoise music; the\nman\u2019s been blistering eardrums in over 350 recordings\nsince 1979. Like most of the experimental music world, in addition to copious solo albums, there are copious\ncollaborations, often live.\nhis album, mastered by James\nPlotkin, sees him collaborating with\nSwedish saxophonist Mats Gustafsson and Hungarian drummer Bal\u00e1zs\nP\u00e1ndi. It\u2019s always interesting to hear\nMerzbow blending his style with that\nof another band or artist, to which his\nmany and vastly diverse work with Boris or even he Haters is a testament.\nhis album is certainly no exception,\nnot least because Merzbow has cited\nfree jazz artists such as Albert Ayler\nas big in\ufb02uences and suggested that\nhis sound was like mixing elements\nof these in\ufb02uences with electronic\nAMS album of the week\nVeronica Falls released their self titled debut\nalbum back in 2011 to a smattering of applause\nfrom the indie pop scene. Adding shoegaze elements and some great little indie guitar riffs to\nthe basic Camera Obscura template made for\na very listenable and fun album. It never really\nclicked for me though, and after a few listens\nI\u2019d pretty much forgotten about the band. That\nis until a few weeks ago, when I saw they\u2019d released a new album, and decided to give it a go.\nI expected very little, since bands with forget-tabledebutstendtoreleaseevenworsesophomorerecords.Instead,Iwasblown\naway. This could well be my favourite twee pop release for a couple of years.\nThere\u2019s not really anything new here. It\u2019s the same basic formula of twee pop\nwith a bit of noise pop and shoegaze. It\u2019s got the same male / female vocal inter-play. It\u2019s got the same little indie guitar riffs thrown in a few times every song.\nIt\u2019s just better at all of them. The songs seem to be a lot more well thought out.\nThe choruses are catchier. The first album had a few great tracks (the new album\nremindedmeofthat)suchas\u2018BadFeeling\u2019and\u2018ComeOnOver\u2019andalotoffairly\naverage ones. The lows of this might be the same tedious twee pop filler but the\npeaks are truly fantastic. \u2018If You Still Want Me\u2019 and \u2018Buried Alive\u2019 are already two\nof my most played tracks over the last 6 months or so and I\u2019ve only had them a\nfew weeks. \u2018Broken Toy\u2019 and \u2018Waiting for Something to Happen\u2019 are also some of\nthe best modern twee pop around as well.\nAs with the vast majority of twee pop albums, there are a few that don\u2019t work.\nIt\u2019s tough to make 12 consistent tracks of catchy fun without a couple of clangers\n(evenDearCatastropheWaitress[Belle and Sebastian]had\u2018StepIntoMyOffice\nBaby\u2019) and \u2018Falling Out\u2019 and \u2018Last Conversation\u2019 tick that box here. However, the\nvastmajorityisgoodandthereareafewtracksofabsolutegold.Thisisdefinitely\na record I\u2019d recommend to indie pop fans and one I imagine I\u2019ll still be listening to\nin months to come (with a few skipped tracks...). I definitely won\u2019t be forgetting\nabout Veronica Falls again any time soon.\nColdCutsofNoise\nRiaz Agahi reviewsthemightycollaborativealbumCuts\npioneers like Karlheinz Stockhausen\nthrough pure electronic noise.\nherefore, it is great to see him\nworking with one of the true heroes\nof modern free jazz in Mats Gustafsson. Although much younger, Gustafsson has been just as proli\ufb01c and\nhas notable projects such as Fire! and\nhe hing to show for it, as well as an\nextensive solo output. He\u2019s from the\nSwedish town of Ume\u00e5, which has\nproduced many notable artists, such\nas Meshuggah and Refused, and according to Gustafsson had a punk and\nhardcore scene running in parallel\nwith free jazz, and perhaps Gustafsson\ncould be viewed as a product of his\nenvironment. He is often known and,\nunfortunately, pigeonholed for the aggressive use of a squealing saxophone\nbut in fact he has also been known\nto perform with live electronics too,\nsomething which is present in this al-bum, and for another example of him\nbreaking with this stereotype of his\nwork, see the more measured and accessible album Exit! by Fire! Orchestra released earlier this year.\nBal\u00e1zs P\u00e1ndi has performed in an\namazing variety of projects, having\nworked with Venetian Snares, Italian\nnoise-jazz-rock group Zu, personal\nfavourites he Kilimanjaro Darkjazz\nEnsemble, for the past few years, been\na live drummer for Merzbow. Unbeknownst to me, I actually saw them\nperform together at Supersonic last\nyear, with Niko Wenner and Eugene\nRobinson from Oxbow also making\nappearances.\nAlthough most people have focused\non the interaction between Merzbow\nand free jazz, which is certainly inter-esting, I can\u2019t help but feel that P\u00e1ndi\u2019s\ndrumming is the place to start. Once\nagain, everyone has described it as\nfree jazz based, and although mostly\ntrue, this ignores some beats that are\nmore common in metal, not least of\nall, the use of a blast beat. Of course,\nsince 1994\u2019s Venereology, chaotic\nmetal drumming and electronics that\nblend noise and grind has intermittently been a part of Merzbow\u2019s sound.\nMerzbow\u2019s role in all of this is arguably a lot more restrained than normal,\nwith him and Gustafsson sharing the\nrole that Merzbow usually occupies,\nand at times Merzbow\u2019s sound even\nachieves some bassy tones while Gustafsson\u2019s saxophone hits the high ends\npretty hard. his restraint in Merzbow\u2019s noise means that instead of the\ndominant force in the music, a wall\nof enveloping sound, it sits in the mix\nas merely another instrument, with\nmuch less of the entropy normally associated with a Merzbow release. his\ninterpretation is confounded by the\nfact that sometimes it is hard to distinguish Merzbow and Gustafsson.\nA good example of their interplay is\ndemonstrated in \u2018Deep Lines. Cuts\u2019\nwhere they exchange noisy squeals like\nVeronica Falls: WaitingforSomethingtoHappen\nM\nStuart Masson\n2 shredding guitarists trading licks in\na solo.\nOne complaint, perhaps, is that the\nbassy end of the spectrum is not too\nwell covered, with a gap in the mix\nonly occasionally plugged by Merzbow, although it sounds great when he\ndoes. Other bands who have a similarly (yet also quite di\ufb00erent) noisy jazz\nsound such as Supersilent cover this\narea pretty well, so this was one source\nof moderate disappointment for me.\nIt is interesting to note, perhaps,\nthat P\u00e1ndi\u2019s drumming facilitates what\nI would describe as a convergence of\nthe styles associated with Gustafsson\nand Merzbow, sitting nicely between\nnoise and the noisier end of free jazz.\nMore chaotic than Fire!, for example,\nbut less intense and face melting than\nthe likes of Government Alpha. Notably the opener, \u2018Evil Knives. Lives\u2019 is\nparticularly catchy; although I\u2019m sure\nto the uninitiated it\u2019s simply unpleas-ant. he short tracks are a little more\nconventional, in that Merzbow takes\na back seat, droning away nicely in\nthe background, while the saxophone\ntakes centre stage in a standardly Gustafsson noisy free jazz solo. Although\nthis is less cutting edge and less abrasive it is still top quality stu\ufb00 and it is\ninteresting to hear, especially in these\ntracks, but also in the album as a\nwhole, Merzbow as a more laid back,\nrestrained cog in a machine rather\nthan simply an overpowering machine\non his own.\n\n"

Instead, doodle all lecture long and then send us your drawings\ntoarts.felix@ic.ac.uk. ThisdoodlewasdonebyAaniyaAhmed.\nFRIDAY 22 FEBRUARY\n38\nIt can be said that photography is a\nmethod of preserving time. A moment is captured and immortalised in\na 35mm negative, retained and treas-ured. he years may march on, but the\npicture will remain the same, retaining the ability to transport the viewer\ninstantaneously to a certain time and\nplace. If this is the case, then the exhibition of portraits by Man Ray, currently on display at the National Portrait Gallery, have captured not just a\nmoment but an era.\nhe subjects of his portraits, mostly\nshot in Paris between 1920-40, read\nlike a who\u2019s who of the European\navant-garde: Duchamp, Dali, and Matisse all make frequent appearances,\nbut there are also pictures of Le Corbusier, Gurtrude Stein, Hemmingway,\nJoyce\u2026 the list could go on. Almost\nexclusively in black and white, these\nworks show Man Ray as a master of\nlight and shade, comparable to his\ncontemporaries Brassa\u00ef and CartierBresson \u2013 a remarkable achievement\nwhen one considers that photography\nwas never his central medium.\nMan Ray invites us into a world that\nhas now gone forever. His pictures\nare intimate, almost confessional, and\ndisplay the human side of the artistic\nvisionaries of the 20th century. Picasso\nin his studio, Stein in her apartment,\nthese pictures show us places that were\noften o\ufb00 limits for the public. When\ncontrasted with today\u2019s obsession with\nsharing photographs (Facebook is estimated to receive 3,000 photos every\nsecond) one realises how privileged we\nare to have an insight into such a remarkable time.\nHowever, that\u2019s not to say this is\nan exhibition is without its \ufb02aws.\nhe sheer number of famous names\ncaptured by Ray\u2019s lens, all displayed\ntogether, can become slightly over-whelming; deadening the impact such\nphotos would have if seen individu-ally. At some points in the exhibition\nit felt as though the focus was not on\nthe man behind the camera, but rather\nthose in front of it. his is not helped\nby the fact that we are presented with\ncopies of Vogue featuring Man Ray\u2019s\nshots of authors and models. his feeling continues into the last section of\nthe gallery, which looks at Man Ray\u2019s\nlife in Hollywood and Paris from 1940-76. he centrepiece is a series of photographs from the Sunday Times portraying Catherine Deneuve. hese are\nneither inspiring nor intriguing. Placing this at the end creates an anticlimactic \ufb01nish to what had largely been\na solid collection of Man Ray\u2019s work\nLuckily the exhibition manages to\nturn the attention back to Man Ray\nby featuring some of his artistic pho-tography. His famous work Le Violon d\u2019Ingres, showing a woman\u2019s back\nadorned with the F-holes of a cello,\nis present, along with stills from the\nfour \ufb01lms he produced. However, for\nme the highlight of the show came in\nhis solarised portraits. Solarisation, a\nprocess in which the image\u2019s tone is\npartially or completely reversed, was\nperfected by Man Ray and his assistant Lee Miller, who features in many\nof these works. Man Ray used this effect to create o\ufb00-kilter, somewhat otherworldly photographs, which are all\nexceptionally beautiful\nMan Ray\u2019s work with colour is also\nexhibited here. Early pieces, which had\nto be painstakingly assembled from\nseparately coloured negatives, possess\nwonderfully muted tones. His later\nwork, by contrast, has lost some of\nthis magic. When using more modern\ntechniques, Man Ray\u2019s work simply\nFred Fyles Writer\nfails to impress. It could be that this\nis something to do with our society\u2019s\nfetishisation of all things \u2018vintage\u2019 \u2013\nsee Instagram if you want an example.\nHowever, I feel that this phenomenon\nis due to something else. Man Ray\u2019s\nwork is a product of his time. he\nequipment he used, the people he\nphotographed, the way he collaborated with a circle of artists. hese are all\nthings that have been con\ufb01ned to the\nearly 20th century, and it is this that\nmakes the exhibition so special.

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 22 FEBRUARY\n24\nLeonardo Ialongo\nA European Citizenship (Part II)\nLeonardo Ialongo discusses the value of European sovereignity in\nan increasingly competitive world\nn last week\u2019s article I discussed some of the reasons\nwhy European integration is\nnecessary. However in recent\nyears, due to the economic\ncrisis, it has been the shortcomings of\nthe union, rather than its advantages,\nwhich have been under the spotlight.\nhis \ufb01nancial crisis, although it originated in America due to the private\ndebt bubble, soon spread in the fertile\nground of European public debt. he\nbanks that were impoverished by the\ncrisis could not lend money to the\nstates, which in turn struggled to pay\nback their debt. he countries not able\nto cope with debt, and unable to devalue their currency like in the past,\nwere forced to ask the European Union for help. his started the process\nof bailouts and austerity. It also started\nto draw criticism towards the Euro. It\nwas deemed too weak and, according\nto some, destined to fail. I could not\nagree more. However it is not because\nthe Euro project is wrong or utopic;\nthe Euro was doomed due its systemic\nweakness. he European jurisdiction,\nin fact, divides the powers between\nthe ECB and the national governments\nin a way that does not let them to effectively confront their debt. he ECB\nhas powers to oversee the monetary\npolicies, and yet no control on public\ndebt and no right to issue European\nbonds; on the other side the national\ngovernments have little or no control\non monetary policy. his creates an\ninstability that will necessarily crush\nany attempt at a single currency. here\nare therefore two options: one is to\nabandon the Euro; the other is to remove these systemic \ufb02aws. If we are to\nkeep the Euro, the symbol of European\neconomic integration, more central\nEuropean oversight on national debt\nis necessary, and it needs to be accompanied by the famous Eurobonds. his\nshould be and is the aim for the EU in\nthe short term.\nIf the analysis of the crisis reveals the\nsystemic weakness of the monetary\nunion, there is another lesson to be\nlearnt. he globalised economy has diminished the power of single states. In\nthe past, a state was a political entity\nof su\ufb03cient power to prevent the market and the private companies from\nendangering the interests of citizens.\nNow it seems that the markets and big\ncorporations can in\ufb02uence national\npolicies to the extent of driving countries to impose unpopular legislations,\nsometimes arguably against the will\nand interest of their people. To me\nit seems that this is the real threat to\nnational sovereignty, and that the EU\nis the best option we have to maintain it. he concept of sovereignty is\nquite complex, and for clarity, I will\nbe using it in the sense of an institution capable of defending the interests of its members against foreign\nintrusion. he EU in fact might not\nalways represent the interests of your\nparticular country, but it will defend\nthe wellbeing of the European people\nas a whole. herefore if the European\nUnion is more e\ufb00ective in preserving\nthe interests of the European popula-tion, it will achieve, on a global scale,\nthe sovereignty that the individual\nstate does not have the power to main-tain. So long as the European Union\nremains a democratic government, it\ncan therefore be the means of protecting popular sovereignty. Recently he\nIndependent a\ufb03rmed in an article by\nMary Dejevsky that: \u201cmembership [to\nthe EU] has given the Scots and the\nWelsh a sense of security that allows\nthem to a\ufb03rm their national identity\nin a positive way they were not able to\nbefore.\u201d his perfectly underlines the\nmessage I am trying to convey. More\nEuropean economic integration will\ngive the economic security necessary\nto express national identity and preserve popular sovereignty from external interference.\nIf I agree with the direction in which\nEurope is heading, I do not agree with\nthe way it is doing it. he project of a\nstronger union, to the extent of a federal state, has always been part of the EU\nsince it was envisioned by its founding fathers. However until now, in the\nwords of Jacques Delors, \u201cl\u2019Europe\navance le visage masqu\u00e9\u201d (Europe advances with its face masked). A federal\nEurope has always been a project of the\nEuropean political elite, rather than of\nthe people. If this was to begin with a\ngood approach \u2013 as it laid the foundations for economic integration \u2013 it is\nnow becoming its major drawback.\nhe reason is that this elitist approach\nhas alienated the European popula-tion. his is further aggravated by the\ninternal organisation of the Union. All\nthe major posts are appointed by the\nnational governments and the only\ndirectly elected body is the European\nParliament. However the parliament\nhas very limited powers: it can in fact\nonly vote legislations and amend them\nbut not propose them. Furthermore,\nthe most important leadership \ufb01gure,\nthe President of the Commission, is\nappointed by the national governments through the European Council\nand the parliament can only veto it.\nAll of this complicated bureaucracy\nundermines the principle of direct\nrepresentation. If Europe wants the\nsupport of its people it needs to start\na process of democratisation of its in-stitutions. his way it will also gain the\ndemocratic legitimisation it needs to\nlegislate and continue the process of\nintegration.\nhe issue however lies in the reformation of these institutions. It was\noften the national governments that\nstopped such a process for fear of losing their national sovereignty. As summarised in the Spinelli Group\u2019s Manifesto,\n\u201c[\u2026] whereas the formidable challenges of a manifold crisis demand\ncommon responses, drawn at least at\nEuropean level, too many politicians\nfall tempted to believing in national\nsalvation only. In a time of interdependence and a globalised world,\nclinging to national sovereignties and\nintergovernmentalism is not only\nwarfare against the European spirit; it\nis but an addiction to political impotence.\u201d\nNational salvation is an illusion fed\nto the public by demagogic Eurosceptics, who use a narrative that appeals\nto the nationalist feelings of European\ncitizens. his is especially strong in\nBritain where the shadow of the lost\nempire still triggers national pride. he\nproblem lies in what I will call cultural\nintegration. he feeling of being a European citizen, and caring about what\nhappens outside your borders is fundamental for the progress of the EU.\nIf this sentiment is in some way developing in some Eurozone countries,\nin Britain \u2013 where Europe still means\nacross the channel \u2013 it seems like an\nimpossible request. It is therefore cultural integration that should be having\nthe highest priority for the EU. his\nreminds me of the famous words of\nMassimo D\u2019Azeglio, one of the founding fathers of Italy, \u201cPur troppo s\u2019\u00e8 fatta\nl\u2019Italia, ma non si fanno gl\u2019Italiani\u201d\n(Translated to: \u201cUnfortunately we have\ncreated Italy, and yet not the Italians\u201d).\nSimilarly in Europe, until the consciousness of European citizenship\ndevelops, Europe will remain a weak\nentity. he crisis and the lack of direct\ndemocratic representation seriously\nundermine any attempt at cultural\nintegration. I feel it is our responsibility as European Citizens to make\nour voices heard and demand more\ndemocratic representation, so that the\nEuropean Union can become a direct\nexpression of our popular sovereignty.\n\u201c\nIf Europe\nwants the\nsupport of\nits people it\nneeds to start\na process of\ndemocratisa-tion of its in-stitutions.\nI\nA crisis of\nintegration\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT\nSport Editors: Oli Benton,\nMargot Pikovsky, Sorcha Cotter\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 22 FEBRUARY\n54\nOn a cool Friday February afternoon a\nrag-tag team of students (and alumni\nthat can\u2019t seem to get away) gathered\nin the shadow of the Royal Albert Hall\nto take a van-load of trestle tables into\nImperial College\u2019s Union Dining Hall\nin preparation for an event that has\nbeen a long time coming \u2013 the 2013\nedition of the Imperial College Chess\nCongress.\nFor the last two weeks entries\nwere \ufb02ying in thick and fast, to the\npoint where we were worried that we\nwouldn\u2019t be able to accommodate all\nthe players! For this congress we used\nthe improved venue of the dining hall,\nwhich was opposite the space used at\nthe last one (but had the gym above\nand bar below so potentially noisy).\nhe downside of our new space is that\nwe had a capacity of between 80 and\n90 players compared to the old room\u2019s\n110-120 \u2013 luckily, the number of entries peaked on the day at a cosy 88\nwhich meant that despite promising to\npotentially turn cash-on-the-day entries away, we didn\u2019t have to in the end.\nhe round on Friday night got o\ufb00 to\na lovely start. here was a brief scare\nas Metric (Imperial College\u2019s night-club) was directly below the venue\nbut it turned out not to be a problem,\nwith the faint hum of a Gangnam Style\nremix barely audible at about 10pm\nas the games \ufb01nished and provided a\nbackground beat to tidying up in the\nevening.\nSaturday brought a fresh, crisp start\nand the free tea, co\ufb00ee and snacks provided to the players throughout the\ntournament assisted in waking everybody up in time for the morning round.\nWe also had the pleasure of Ray Morris-Hill of Battersea chess club drop\nby to take some lovely photographs of\nthe room and players with the morning\nlight streaming through the windows.\nhis presented a rather interesting\nchallenge, as the angle of the light shifted throughout the morning and two\nboards were moved to areas where the\nlight wasn\u2019t in a player\u2019s eyes \u2013 sunlight\nin England admittedly wasn\u2019t high on\nthe list of things we thought could interrupt a chess tournament and we will\nbe petitioning the Union to assist us\nwith some curtains for next year. here\nwas a lot of \ufb01ghting, aggressive chess\nbeing played as well with players eager\nto start their Saturdays o\ufb00 with wins.\nSeveral very exciting games in both the\nmorning and afternoon sessions lasted\nall the way through the 4-hour sessions\n(and in a few cases even longer owing\nto the 90min+30sec/move time con-trol).\nIn-between rounds the players tended to \ufb02ock towards either Gloucester\nRoad or South Kensington where plenty of food and drink outlets were available for lunch \u2013 Sandwich World (sim-ply known to Imperial College students\nas THE Sandwich Shop) on Gloucester\nRoad was a particularly popular destination with a large number of freshly\nmade baguettes making appearances in\nthe playing hall at various points.\nhe amount of sugar (biscuits) and\nca\ufb00eine consumed by the crowd was\nalso impressive, and underestimated by\nus as we had to go back to supermarkets to buy more supplies on no fewer\nthan four occasions after the start of\nthe congress \u2013 but completely worth\nit despite foam cups now becoming an\nendangered species as players and sta\ufb00\nalike stayed in high spirits throughout\nthe day.\nGoing into the last round, the Open\nhad two players race ahead of the pack\nin IM homas Rendle and FM Miguel\nNavarro-Cia of Imperial College on\n4/4, and the resulting draw in the \ufb01nal round guaranteed them joint-\ufb01rst\nplace in the tournament as their nearest competition was on 3/4 going into\nthe afternoon round, due to homas\nRendle grinding a very hard-earned\nvictory over IM Augustin Madan in the\nmorning.\nhe next section to be determined\nwas the Minor, where Pascoe Rapacchi\nwas sole leader on 4/4 going into the \ufb01nal round but was successfully caught\nby the resurgent Anup Sinha (Imperial\nCollege Chess Club President all the\nway back in 2004-05!) who was on 3/4,\nand they therefore \ufb01nished joint-\ufb01rst in\nthe Minor.\nhe battle for the Major was the last\nto be settled, going down to the wire\nbetween Bob Kane of West London\nand young Michele Donati of Italy well\nafter the winter sun had set. In a very\ncharged position Michele was down to\nusing his increment for each move to\nBob\u2019s 20 minutes. Michele, however,\nheld strong and after a very tense and\ndrawn out while a draw was agreed,\nguaranteeing both of them a share of\n\ufb01rst place.\nGames all over the room were \ufb01nishing late on the \ufb01nal round though\nwith potential prize money on the line\n\u2013 additional grading prizes were announced to a satis\ufb01ed crowd at the start\nof the second round, with two (U2100\n& U1950) in the Open, two (U1800 &\nU1700) in the Major and one in the\nMinor (U125). Despite having fewer\nplayers than the Open and Major, an\nadditional U100/Ungraded grading\nprize was introduced for the Minor after Rafael Larios generously donated to\nmake this possible (ungraded players\nwere eligible for this grading prize).\ncontinued from the back page\n>>\nJohn Sargent Sports Writer\nCheckmate at Chess Congress\ncrews in front did not help.

Top tip\nfor you there aspiring GB rowers!\nA \ufb01nal mention should go to the Intermediate 8, who in-keeping with IC\ntraditions caught an unfortunate crab\nin the run in to the line. I have searched\nlong and hard for the video of the Matt\nLunt classic which still brings a tear to\nmy eye but unfortunately I think his\nlawyers have had it removed from the\ninternet.\nSo, 2nd in the Victor Ludorum, 3\ngolds and 7 medals in total. All-in-all a\nthoroughly successful weekend in the\nICBC camp and with both Heads of the\nRiver coming up soon (and of course\n#LadsOnTour in Amsterdam) it\u2019s going to be an action packed few months\nfor ICBC. he overall goal has to be to\nsteal Durham\u2019s self-appointed crown of\nmost successful undergraduate rowing\nprogram in the UK and continue racking up the BUCS points. And with 125\npoints gained from BUCS head alone,\nit\u2019s your move fencing!\nPreviously in the season, IC 1\u2019s ventured to muddy Hertfordshire with\nsome usual players missing and some\nturning up hungover to take on RVC\n1\u2019s in the BUCs league, so understandably we su\ufb00ered an unfortunate loss.\nHowever, with 2 more chances to play\nthem, we were determined to show\nthem what we\u2019re made of.\nhis Monday, our \ufb01rst chance\ncame- a LUSL match in our home\nturf of Ethos. With every player intact\n(except WA Kirsty who managed to\nbreak her shoulder at the beginning\nof the season...) we were ready for a\nwin. he \ufb01rst quarter started badly,\nwith a quick turnover from RVC 1\u2019s\nthey scored 4 goals in succession before we had scored any! heir GS in\nparticular surprised us with her quick\nmovement and superb aim. However,\nthis made us yet more determined and\nwith some of the best play we\u2019ve seen\nthrough the centre court we quickly\npulled back into the lead. Our shooter\nTamar showed she was equally capable\nof scoring from anywhere in the D with\nshot after shot going in, (this is a girl\nwho once showed up slightly drunk to\na match and was still able to shoot perfectly \u2013 albeit sometimes her catching\nwasn\u2019t quite as on form). By the end of\nthe \ufb01rst quarter we had a lead of 14-8,\nextending 10 goals ahead of their 0-4\nlead.\nIt seemed GK Sophie had the hardest job to do with their shooter easily\nbeing their stand out player. Using her\nheight to our advantage, Sophie pressured RVC into doing loopier passes\nthat often the GS couldn\u2019t even reach.\nFurthermore, Sophie\u2019s blocking skills\nare superb meaning the RVC GS occasionally tried to shove Sophie out of the\nway which luckily the umpires saw and\ncalled contact. On the other side of the\ncourt, WA Nancy, GA Poppy and Centre Sam were perfecting their centre\npasses. With Nancy only joining the 1\u2019s\njust before Christmas, this has been a\ndi\ufb03cult area in recent games. However, on Monday something just clicked\nand they began working seamlessly\ntogether, easily getting the ball into the\nD and scoring within 3 or 4 passes. Of\ncourse, nothing ever works perfectly\nall the time, and the odd pass into GS\nTamar went a bit astray, with one sending her \ufb02ying back onto her bum.\nIn the \ufb01nal quarter, we intended to\nneaten our game, as against a better\nteam every mistake would probably\ncost us a goal. We saw fast turnovers\nas WD Tereze and GD Verity came out\nof nowhere to steal the ball from under\ntheir noses. Verity just seems to have\nendless energy when she plays, leaping across the court to intercept pass-es. Due to some contact from RVC\u2019s\nWD, Nancy managed to get \u2018Netball\n\ufb01nger\u2019 due to the ball pelting the tips\nof her \ufb01ngers at full speed, causing a\nfair amount of pain. Luckily Claude,\nwho usually plays WD/GD, was able\nto quickly come on to play WA. Considering she rarely plays attack, Claude\nshowed her versatility as she \ufb01t in well\nand by the end of the game the score\nwas 61-39.\nIC 1\u2019s position in the LUSL league\nonly goes to show that they should be\nin a higher BUCs league. Currently 4th\nin LUSL, below Medics 1\u2019s (1 league\nabove in BUCS) and Kings medics 1\u2019s\n(2 leagues above in BUCS) and above\nplenty of teams that are in higher\nBUCs leagues too. Unfortunately, due\nto some undeserving losses the 1\u2019s are\nlooking at \ufb01nishing second this year in\nthe BUCs tables but with most of the\nteam returning next year, we\u2019re looking\nup.

It\u2019s\nnot exactly the most highly\nscienti\ufb01c of surveys (*dodges\nopen \ufb01re*), but answered by Felix\nfood writers and fellow food lovers,\nmaybe the survey will give a new life\ninto the food on campus \u2013 or not,\nin some cases. Most of the people\nI asked ate at Imperial outlets on a\nregular, weekly basis. About a third\nof the people I asked only ate in uni\nvery rarely, when they\u2019ve forgotten\ntheir packed lunches or are staying\nin late \u2013 can anything really beat a\nhomemade lunch? I think so.\nTry the most popular place to eat,\nFUEL, oh yes, that \u2018pie place\u2019 with\nthe in\ufb01nite mash and gravy (appar-ently the beetroot smoothies are\ngood too). Everyone I asked who\nhad been to FUEL (apart from one,\ncrazy person) said it was great. he\nfavourite pies were the chicken based\npies, either with ham or chorizo (the\nMatador pie). But hold out you hungry meat eaters \u2013 apparently the\ngoat\u2019s cheese one is also fantastic.\nIn general, most people I asked felt\nthe pies are good value for money,\nconsidering that they are handmade\nand you can \ufb01ll your pie box full to\nthe brim with mash and gravy, given\nthat there isn\u2019t a helpful but annoying person serving it out. People felt\nthat the salad and chicken or salmon\nboxes are also good, healthier than\nthe pies, but more expensive. I can\nempathise with the complaints regarding when Pieminister run out of\nthe best pies. It can also get pretty\ncrowded in there.\nhe second most popular place\nto eat lunch was the JCR, basically because of the large selection\nof sandwiches and wraps, which is\nobviously an easy and cheap lunch.\nhe Library Caf\u00e9 was in third place,\nagain because of the sandwich-lovers\namongst us and of course, the jacket\npotatoes, the favourite \ufb01lling being\nchilli. For a hot meal, the jacket potato is probably the cheapest thing\non campus and will keep you going\nthroughout the rest of the day. In\nfourth place was the Queen\u2019s Tower\nRooms (QTR), a hot meal on its own\nwill only take you back a few quid,\nwhereas the meal deal will take you\nback around \u00a35. he meal deal is very\n\ufb01lling, so either go there with a massive appetite or an intention to sleep\nall afternoon. Because of my poor\nquestion-asking skills many people\nsaid their favourite place to eat at uni\nwas he Sandwich Shop on Gloucester Road. I felt I should mention it\nbecause everyone does rave about it\n\u2013 they also do noodles if you\u2019re not in\na sandwich mood.

One person\nfelt the prices of juices and water is\ntoo expensive. I disagree, I feel the\nprices are competitive with supermarket prices.

College estimated in\ntheir announcement that it will take\naround 30 minutes by tube to South\nKensington. his has been criticised\nfor not taking into account the door-to-door travel time. It has been argued that with the walk from South\nKensington and congestion added, the\njourney could take 45 minutes either\nway. he Union estimated the journey as 35-40 minutes. Harding-Roots\nacknowledged that it would be a tube\nride every day, but said that busses to\nand from the Union were something\nthat they were working out. Of the\ndistance issue, Harding-Roots said:\n\u201cWe need a dose of reality\u201d, and that it\n\u201cwould be great to have them in Kensington & Chelsea or Hammersmith\n& Fulham, but [it is] not a\ufb00ordable\u201d.\nHe said that people need to be \u201crealistic\u201d and that \u201cW3 ticks most of the\nboxes\u201d. he Union disagrees with this\nevaluation suggesting Hammersmith,\nFulham and other such areas would be\nmore appropriate, as well as highlighting that the Evelyn Gardens and Garden Hall also tick the correct boxes.\nHarding-Roots said that the location\nwas \u201cfrankly one area we couldn\u2019t \ufb01ll\u201d,\nand that they \u201clooked at major new redevelopment projects in Earl\u2019s Court\nand Hammersmith\u201d. He said: \u201cEarl\u2019s\nCourt would have been fantastic\u201d and\nthat the development plan of the area\n\u201cused to include student accommodation\u2026 but not any more\u201d. He said that\nthere were \u201csome student accommodation options in Hammersmith\u201d but\nrents would have been around \u00a3200\nper week. Discussing the halls and\nlocation in the announcement on the\nCollege\u2019s website, Jane Neary, Director of Campus (formerly Commercial)\nServices, said: \u201cNo stone has been left\nunturned in the search to identify opportunities for student accommoda-tion. Numerous other developments\nhave been considered, including projects in Fulham, Hammersmith and\nEaling. hese were rejected however\nbecause they were either too expen-sive, too far from Imperial campuses\nor they couldn\u2019t achieve the critical\nmass to create a vibrant student community of at least 400 bed spaces in\none location.\u201d he validity of the 400\n\ufb01gure and where it is from has been\nquestioned. Felix contacted Jane\nNeary with questions about the halls,\nbut, at the time of going to print, she is\nyet to reply.\nhe distance has been highlighted\nas a problem for the student experi-ence. Having to travel in such a long\ndistance could reduce students\u2019 ability\nto participate in Clubs and Societies as\nwell as reducing the sense of community that they feel with course-mates\nwho live closer to the College. In a\nUnion website blog post Becky Lane,\nDeputy President (Welfare), pointed\nout how \u201cin 2015, there will be 700\nstudents who may not engage with\nSouth Kensington based services such\nas Ethos gym, the Disability Advisory\nService, the Counselling Service and\nthe Health Centre\u201d. As well as this, the\nUnion question the \u201cbusiness case\u201d,\nstating that prices would be above that\nof private accommodation in the same\narea and closer to South Kensington.\nhey also noted that the \u201conly applicable evidence is unfavourable \u2013 that\na nearby University of the Arts (UAL)\nhall isn\u2019t full\u201d. At Imperial once a room\nis o\ufb00ered you must either take it or\n\ufb01nd private accommodation.\nhe price of the halls has been an issue that the Union has raised. Harding-Roots said that \u201ca\ufb00ordable rents\u201d\nwere the \u201cmain focus\u201d. He said that\nCollege needed a \u201cbalanced portfolio,\nincluding lower band rooms, which\nare under \u00a3150 per week. He went\non to say \u201cPeople will want di\ufb00erent\nthings and people have di\ufb00erent views.\nNorth Acton will double the amount\nof rooms in the lowest price band\u201d.\nhe rooms are likely to cost \u00a3146 per\nweek at the latest estimate from College. his doesn\u2019t take into account the\ncost of travel. Which would depend on\nwhether or not the student in question had a weekly, monthly, annual,\nor just a normal oyster card. With an\nannual travel card for a student between zones 1-2 being about \u00a316 per\nweek, this puts the halls at roughly\n\u00a3162 per week. his is in a similar,\nand occasionally higher, band than the\nEvelyn Garden halls, whilst being further away. his is the cheapest possible travel card. It also means that with\nthe price is above the \u00a3150 price band\ndescribed above. he Union estimates\nthe price to be \u00a3165 per week due the\ncost of a weekly student travel card.\nhe future of Evelyn Gardens is in\ndoubt, with the possibility that it will\nbe closed. College has 32 years left on\nthe lease, which is owned by the Wellcome Trust \u2013 who have indicated that\nthey want the properties back at the\nend of the lease. Imperial are trying\nto see if they can extend the lease, but\ncurrent indications are that this is not\npossible. College has said that to redo\nthe halls for the long term would cost\ntoo much money. he Union says that\nthis is simply due to neglect in the past\nand is \u201cself in\ufb02icted\u201d. he Union have\nurged College to protect Evelyn Gardens. Currently North Acton is said to\nbe an insurance policy.\nGarden Hall (which is the most\noversubscribed hall) will close at the\nend of this year if the new part of Wilson House is ready, a move which the\nUnion have criticised due to Garden\u2019s\nprice and location. Wilson House was\npraised as \u201ca brilliant example of what\nwe would like more of as it is close and\na\ufb00ordable\u201d by Harding-Roots. Speaking of Garden, he stated that it is in a\npoor state and that it needs \u201curgent remedial works\u201d. He noted that College\nwould \u201clook at redoing [redecorating]\nGarden or alternatives for all College\nuses as [we are] very short of space\non campus\u201d. his furthers speculation\nthat Garden will be turned into o\ufb03ce\nspace.\nhe announcement of the North Acton halls says that feedback from students was used for the survey, which\nthe Union contests, saying that most\nstudents \ufb01lling in the Accommodation survey wanted to have a travel\ntime of less than 30 minutes and in\nZone 1. he Union went further to say\nthat \u201cthis project ignored the feedback\nfrom students taken in the 2011 Accommodation Survey\u201d. Most students\ntaking part in the survey highlighted\nthat the current halls were in a good\nlocation. On the survey, the Union\nclaims that only 13% of respondents\nfavoured halls such as North Acton.\nhe Union also stressed that most\namenities \u2013 such as an onsite bar \u2013\nwere not asked for by the students.\nhe Union has stated that College\nshould o\ufb00er a range of accommodation and set out the three parameters:\n\u201cHigh speci\ufb01cation and close, but not\ncheap. Close and cheap, but not at\nsuch a high speci\ufb01cation. High speci\ufb01cation and cheap, but a little bit further away from campus.\u201d\nhere have also been fears over the\nwardening facilities in the halls. Harding-Roots said that there were \u201cno\nplans to drop wardening\u201d, and there\nwill be a 24/7 sta\ufb00ed reception. he\nwarden to student ratio that will be in\nNorth Acton is, at the minute, unclear.\nhe Union have hinted that they think\nthat the new halls will \ufb01nd it di\ufb03cult\nto recruit a wardening team.\nAs well as pastoral care, safety concerns were raised. he walk from\nNorth Acton through to Hammersmith has been deemed unsafe and\nis advised against. College have said\nthat no \ufb01rst years are accommodated\nat Hammersmith, but that they could\nlook into providing transport as they\nwould not want undergraduates to\nwalk through an unsafe area.\nWhen asked by Felix if the plans\nwere a done deal and the new halls\nwould de\ufb01nitely be in North Acton\nHarding-Roots said \u201cit is\u201d. He said that\nthere was no chance of reversing the\npayment but Imperial now can guide\nthe layout and design, saying \u201cwe want\nto engage with students to \ufb01nd out\nwhat they would like to see there\u201d.\nhe information was made public\nat this time due to the purchase of the\nhalls being commercially sensitive,\nwith Harding-Roots suggesting that\nImperial did not want another university to sweep in and take the halls.\nhe search for new halls has been\ngoing on for three years, and North\nActon has been on the cards for one\nyear. he Management Board approved the plans in December, and\nCollege Council approved it in January. College now own the halls after\nbuying them o\ufb00 of Berkeley First, who\nare a specialist student halls developer.\nhe have been involved with Imperial before as they are part of the joint\nventure at Gri\ufb00on Studios, which had\nsome problems reported by Felix last\nyear, as well as Paragon.\nEditorial: page 2\n>>\nUnion President Comment: page 18\n>> DPW Comment: page 19\nDPE Comment: page 21\nLetters: page 21\n>>\n>>\n>>\nBerkeley first\nMasterplan for\nthe new halls\nBerkeley first\nAemun Reza\nSigns put up\nby the Union\n\n"

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 22 FEBRUARY 37\nSnowdonia\nlandscape\ncolours\nSherfield green\nEva Rosenthal Arts Editor\nWith each passing year, the Artsfest\nannual exhibition increases in impor-tance. his show is the result of a collaboration between two of the largest\narts societies on campus: Leonardo\nFine Arts society and Photgraphic so-ciety. Last week, Rocio Molina gave us\nan insight into the trials and tribulations of putting on an exhibition. What\nwas the outcome?\nSlightly woozy on free white wine\nthat tasted fruity and delicious and\nwent down like grape juice \u2013 it should\nbecome common knowledge to the\naverage student that so-called \u2018private\u2019\nviews are always alcoholically provided\nfor \u2013 my eyes can perhaps be forgiven\nfor initially only managing to focus on\nthe great expanses of white wall that\nremained free of art. he Blythe gallery being a \ufb01ne small space, eventually\ncoming upon the collaborative piece\nwas not quite unlike hunting for green\n\ufb01elds in Antarctica; the landscape certainly popped up out of the lightness.\nWhilst the exhibition can seem a bit\nsparse, it is also quite a feat of bravery\nand rather weirdly charming in a way\nthat only unpolished things can manage to be.\nhe piece itself is a photograph \u2013 taken on the Photosoc trip to Snowdonia\n\u2013 deconstructed into square segments,\nsome of which have been taken over\nby artists from Leosoc. Each of the\ncontributors has a unique style and it\nis this that makes the piece most interesting to the viewer. From mad purple\nand jade colouring of the \ufb01elds to well-realised landscapes in an Impressionist\nstyle, seeing the di\ufb00erent approaches\nto the same romantic scenery are a\nwonderful way of looking, \ufb01guratively,\nthrough the eyes of many people.\nNot an Italian job\nGiant fried\negg terrorises\nnaked people\nThe Renaissance is generally considered to be an Italian affair. No one\ncould doubt the profound part that\nthe works of the Italians, such as\nMichangelo and Leonardo da Vinci,\nplayed in this era. But this is not the\nwhole story. The 130 plus artworks\nwhich are currently on display at\nThe Queen\u2019s Gallery depict the flipside of the Renaissance, from the\ndarker lands of Northern Europe.\nThese artworks are certainly a far\ncry from the soft, sensuous curves\nof Botticelli\u2019s The Birth of Venus and\nthey may lack the alluring quality of\nda Vinci\u2019s Mona Lisa, yet these artworks were constructed with skill\nand talent comparable to the Italians\nand are a real feast for the eyes.\nDuring the 15th century, Europe\nexperienced a burst of social, cultural and economic change. The increased use of gold, rather than land,\nfor exchanging wealth enabled money to flow to artists, musicians and\nscientists, rather than just amongst\nlandowners. The demise of feudal-ism, coupled with the decline in the\nRoman Catholic Church\u2019s influence\non North-westerly Europe allowed\nnew philosophical views to arise and\npave the way for new artistic expres-sion. Although the two sub-genres\nof the Northern and Italian Renaissance were in constant cultural ex-change, there are notable differences between the styles. This is mainly\nattributed to the grounding of the\nJemma Pilcher Writer Northern Renaissance works in the\nProtestant Reformation, thus challenging the teachings of the Catholic Church. The distribution of new\ntexts and the subsequent escalation\nof new thinking was fuelled by the\ninvention of the printing press. It\nwas the contribution of the German\nRenaissance giant, Albrecht D\u00fcrer,\nto use printing as a chief method in\ncreating visual artworks.\nA significant quantity of the gallery space is dedicated to his work,\nwith his woodcut prints establishing\na definite highlight of the exhibition.\nHis prints for The Book of the Revelation of St. John (a.k.a Apocalypse)\nare especially awesome to behold,\nas these violent scenes are depicted\nwith such incredible intricacy. The\nlack of colour makes it difficult to\nfocus on a particular character, especially as each image is crammed\nwith action and chaos. These images would have seemed particularly\npoignant in 1498, two years before\nthe heralded end of the world.\nThis exhibit also comprises a collection of sumptuous paintings. A\nfine example of this is Lucas Cranach the Elder\u2019s Apollo and Diana\n(c. 1526), which shows the sun god\nand his twin sister, the moon god-dess, hunting in the nude. The intense contrast between their pale\nskin and the dark, luscious foliage behind them is quintessential\nfor Northern Renaissance paint-ings. Depicting the dominant force\nof nature was a popular theme\namongst German artists of the era\nbut this image also shows the primitive strength of humanity. Diana\nis perched on the back of a stag,\nwith her curly hair gently wrapped\naround its antlers. The fastidious attention to detail is what really makes\nthis painting such a marvel, from the\ndelicate highlights on the stag\u2019s eye,\nto the tiny swan gliding on the lake\nin the distance.\nWithin the corridor, between the\nmain rooms, sits an alcove of glass\ncabinets containing some of the\nmost exquisitely decorated armour\nthat I have ever seen. Each item is\ncovered with fine etching, depicting\nscenes from myths and religious sto-ries. The Parade Shield (ca. 1562-3)\nis particularly beautiful. The entire\nsurface of the blued iron is adorned\nwith embossed figures, portraying\nfour episodes from the life of Julius\nCaesar, illuminated with overlays\nof silver and gold. It has been suspected that this shield was a gift for\nHenry VIII, which is hardly surpris-ing, as it looks like it was crafted for\na king.\nThe furthermost room within the\ngallery is devoted to the incredible\ntechnical skill of the artists from\nthe Netherlands. At opposite ends\nof this room hang two embellished\nFlemish tapestries, The Triumphs\nof Petrarch and The Redemption of\nMan, surrounded by oil paintings\nof rich, saturated colours. My favourite of the paintings on display\nis the double-sided, stand-alone\npanel called Martyrdom of St. Ursula, attributed to the anonymous\nartist known as Master of the Magdalen Legend. One side delineates\nthe quayside massacre of Ursula\u2019s\ncompany of eleven thousand virgins and her betrothed, Conon, the\nson of the pagan King of England.\nThey were returning to Brittany\nfrom their pilgrimage to be baptised\nin Rome, when their vessels were\nattacked by the Huns in Cologne.\nThe entire party was slaughtered,\nincluding Ursula, when she refused\nto marry the barbarian leader. This\npainting is very beautiful despite the\ngraphic scene. Amongst the chaos\nUrsula stands with grace and integ-rity, whilst being targeted by three\narchers. The other side of the panel\ndepicts St. Hugh and St. Bruno.\nThe exhibition closes by paying homage to the great Hans Holbein the Younger. As an important\ncourt artist (most notably for Henry\nVIII) Holbein\u2019s collection is composed mainly of portraits. The lifelike quality of these pieces is truly\nbreathtaking and reinforces the incredible talent of the artists working\nin the renaissance.\nThe masterpieces that run\nthroughout this exhibit transport\nyou into a rich and colourful world,\nwhere infamous kings and brave\nknights dominate; a form of escapism which I highly recommend.\nThe Northern Renaissance: D\u00fcrer\nto Holbein at The Queen\u2019s Gallery.\nTickets from \u00a38.50 for students.\nUntil 14th April.\n\n"

Students have\nhighlighted distance, cost, student ex-perience, and welfare concerns. he\nUnion have launched a campaigned\nagainst the plans, using the Twitter\nhashtag #AgainstActon. Already many\nstudents have voiced their opposition\nin a rare turn of student activism at\nImperial.\nhe College Council (who are the\nhighest decision making body of Imperial) publically announced on Monday 18 February that it had decided to\nauthorise purchase of the land for the\nnew development, with building work\nplanned to begin in May 2013 and \ufb01nish before the start of the 2015-2016\nacademic year. he halls would be located on 1 Victoria Road, Acton, W3\n6BL, house 724 students, and will have\nstudent facilities that are twice the size\nof the JCR and SCR combined. To discover how far along the way the plans\nare Felix contacted Simon HardingRoots, the Chief Operations O\ufb03cer\nof Imperial College London, who said\nthat the land has been bought and relevant documents exchanged. At 10am\non Tuesday 19 February Imperial College Union launched the campaign to\noppose the decision. he Union have\nnow delivered a response to College,\nwhich was passed unanimously by\nUnion Council (see page 5), and have\nstarted putting up posters around\ncampus.\nDuring the meetings discussing the\nplans, Paul Beaumont, Union President, actively opposed the plans. He\ntold Felix: \u201cWe [the Union] believe\nwe\u2019ve already won the quantitative argument against College Management\nwith our analysis of the proposed prices and student accommodation survey data; all we now need is the help\nof students to assure the qualitative\ndata\u201d.

South Kensington\nis not ideal for the student lunch habit,\nbut with its 10% discount to Imperial\nstudents and location mere minutes\naway on Exhibition Road, Green\ufb01elds\nis hoping to change your ways.\nWith its label of \u201csandwich emporium\u201d one might expect Green\ufb01elds\nto fall into one of two categories; a\ndown market deli selling nothing\nmore than you could make yourself,\nor a posh eatery, providing morsels\nthat wouldn't satisfy an anorexic ger-bil, with extortionate prices. It was\nmuch to my delight, then, that I found\na nicely rounded and varied menu,\nincluding the occasional daily spe-cial. However, it is not the sandwiches\nthat stand out here, although I'm sure\nthey would satiate those interested. It\nis, rather, the hot food that makes the\ntrip worthwhile. Ranging from toasted\nciabattas to grilled goats cheese with\nroasted peppers via jacket potatoes\nand omelettes, it is some of the best\navailable in the local area. A good,\nalbeit smaller, selection of smoothie/\nmilkshakes compliments the meals\nnicely (although if you aren't a fan of\nbananas you may wish to ignore that\npart of the menu, since every single\nmilkshake contains them). Other,\nmore mainstream, beverages are avail-able.\nhe highlight of my small sample of\nthe menu was undoubtedly the butter bean and vegetable casserole. A\nbeautiful blend of textures was immediately apparent, with the soft casseroled vegetables nicely balanced with\ncrunchy ones buried in the \ufb02u\ufb00y cous\ncous. Also worthy of mention is the\nsalt brisket of beef toasted ciabatta,\nwhich was served with a well thought\nout garnish including gherkins. Unfortunately, my personal preference\ntends towards a saltier meat, which\nthis certainly wasn't and I felt as\nthough perhaps this was a conscious\ndecision in a misguided attempt to appeal to a larger audience.\nhe accompanying drink, the chocolate and banana frapp\u00e9 milkshake\nwas divine, but strangely came with\na warning from the waitress that it\nwasn't very sweet, so might require\nthe addition of sugar. I couldn't help\nfeeling that the sta\ufb00 expected their\ncustomers to have very uncivilised\npalates, a sentiment which made\nme slightly uncomfortable. his was\nquickly forgotten, however, given the\nexcellent quality of the unsweetened\ndrink.\nA meal at Green\ufb01elds, though of\ngood quality, is not something the average student will be able to indulge in\nmany a time. Even with the 10% dis-count, the prices remain too high to\ncompete with on-campus options, the\njacket potato a prime example. Whilst\nunder \u00a32 in the Library Caf\u00e9, a comparable one at Green\ufb01elds will set you\nback over \u00a35, and whilst some dishes\nare cheaper as takeaway options, the\nappeal of the caf\u00e9 itself is lost. You are\nbest advised to have your student head\non when it comes to ordering.\nHope is not lost for Green\ufb01elds\nthough. With its charming, cosy in-terior, it is the perfect destination\nfor casual one on one meetings and\nlunchtime dates. It's away from the\nreal hustle outside, yet retains enough\nof a busily London feeling to ensure\nthe atmosphere is not that of a countryside cafe at a National Trust castle.\nIt has real appeal, due in part to its\nplentiful, enthusiastic sta\ufb00 and wonderful decor, and I was sad to leave\nand \ufb01nd myself on the cold harsh\nstreets of London. If you are looking\nfor somewhere special to visit for that\nimportant lunch, you needn't look further than Exhibition Road.\nThe grass is greener at Greenfields\nD\nT\nChris Witham reviews the independent caf\u00e9 Greenfields\n\n"

    "content": "Rats get infrared \u2018sixth sense\u2019\nSarah Byrne investigates the brain implant that gives the ability\nto see invisible light\nR\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 22 FEBRUARY\n16\nesearchers at Duke\nUniversity have given\nlab rats the ability to\n\u2018see\u2019 infrared light, in\nresearch published in\nNature Communications last week.\nThe story was reported widely as\nthe rats getting a \u2018sixth sense\u2019. The\nterm is an exaggeration, implying\nsome unexplained or paranormal\neffect. But the reality is startling\nenough.\nThe rats were fitted with an infrared sensor, which was wired up to an\nimplant in the region of their brain\nthat normally reacts to the sensation\nof their whiskers brushing against\nsomething.\nInfrared (IR) light is part of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum that also\nincludes the visible light that we can\nsee, but its wavelength is longer, putting it outside the range our eyes can\ndetect. Infrared perception by living\nthings is not entirely unknown, however \u2014 some bats and snakes have\nbeen found to be able to \u2018see\u2019 IR light\n\u2014 but it is rare, and certainly not the\ncase for rats (which the researchers\ndid double-check in a control experiment with normal rats).\nWith the implants, the rats could\nnot only detect the presence of IR\nlight but could distinguish between\ndifferent frequencies, which could\nbe considered equivalent to seeing\nin colour. In fact they learned to\nnavigate their way around using the\ndifferent infrared sources to guide\nthem.\nOne question remains unanswered\n\u2014 and is a difficult one to answer as\nthe rats can\u2019t report back on what\nthe experience was like. Given that\nthe electrodes were hooked up to\nthe whisker stimulation area of the\nbrain, did \u2018seeing\u2019 infrared light\nfrom the rat\u2019s point of view just feel\nlike touching something with their\nwhiskers? Or was it an entirely new\ntype of sensory experience?\nEthical considerations probably\nrule out trying the technique on\na human volunteer (though who\nwouldn\u2019t be just a little bit curious\nto find out what having a new sense\nwould be like?). So further research\nis needed to establish exactly what is\ngoing on in the rat\u2019s brain.\nThe result raises some intriguing\npossibilities for the future though.\nSo far the focus of such neurological prosthetics has been on restoring normal function where it has\nbeen lost through injury or disease.\nThe best known example is coch-lear implants for deafness. But what\nif we could go a step further and\nuse this technology to actually give\npeople more abilities than any of us\nnaturally have? Super-humans may\nsomeday be a possibility. But first,\nwe need a bit more work on the su-per-rats.\nDOI: 10.1038/ncomms2497\nUpgrade your CV\nWrite for Science\nGet in touch, be put on our mailing list,\nand we\u2019ll send you weekly bursts of\nexciting science stories, ready for you to\nwrite up and get printed here in Felix.\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNeed more science?

If so, your medication could lead\nto aquatic life having a very exhilarating day indeed.\nResearch from Ume\u00e5 University,\nSweden has shown how an \u201cunusually\nhigh\u201d concentration of anti-anxiety\ndrug, Oxazepam, in a river in Sweden\nhas caused \ufb01sh to exhibit a number of\nstrange changes to behaviour.\nWhilst water puri\ufb01cation and treatment systems are supposed to remove\ncontaminants such as drugs, many\nhave slipped past, leading to worry\nthat other drugs may be harming\naquatic life.\nFish take up the drug through the\ntissues in their muscles, meaning that\nthey are incredibly sensitive to even\nsmall concentrations of the drug.\nhe drugged \ufb01sh appeared to leave\ntheir protective shoal formation, preferring to swim individually. When the\nconcentration of drug was increased,\nthe \ufb01sh went one step further and\ntravelled through to unknown places\nfar more willingly than their normal\ncounterparts.\nSecondly, \ufb01sh drugged to any concentration of oxazepam became far\nmore hungry, and more innovative in\n\ufb01nding their food.\nIt is not certain that oxazepam is the\nsole cause of the erratic behaviour, or\nwhether circumstances are to blame,\nconcern has nonetheless been raised\nas to the ecological e\ufb00ects of washing\ndrugs out into the oceans. It is hoped\nthat this will again raise the argument\nfor regulation of aquatic pollutants.\nDOI: 10.1126/science.1226850\nPoor Nemo...\n\n"

When\nstudents say they want to be in a Central London location, one of their primary concerns is how much action\nthey\u2019ll get (along with the friends they\nwill have).\nDon\u2019t let what anyone else says make\nyou think otherwise. North Acton is\nhardly prime London. Imagine the\nlook on a potential one night stand\u2019s\nface when inviting them back to one\u2019s\nplace, via the two night buses from Tiger Tiger. Compare that to the suave\nand sophisticated (and haute) South\nKensington. I think we know who will\nbe taking the skin boat to tuna town.\nhe Union don\u2019t seem to want to focus on this point, but someone needs\nto highlight it. Remember: Action =\nStudent Satisfaction, Forget Against\nActon, it\u2019s: #NoActionInActon\nYours,\nAnonymous\n---Dear Sir,\nLast week you highlighted how the\nUnion Council outvoted the Sabbs\nStar letter on two issues. I believe that this highlights how out of touch with the common students the \u2018Sabb clique\u2019, are\nin their cushty o\ufb03ce, removed from\nbeing students but still well sheltered\nfrom the horror of the real world.\nSurely now it is time for the Sabbs to\nstep up. he Against Acton campaign\nlaunched on Tuesday is the next opportunity to show students that they\ndo actually have a voice in the running\nof Imperial College and that that voice\nis through their elected representa-tives. We are not just \u2018customers\u2019 to be\ndictated too by the whims of a commercial services manager, we are not\nclients or subscribers, we are students.\nI believe the outcome of this cam-paign, and the di\ufb00erence it makes will\nbe indicative of the state and power of\nthe Union, its councils and the Sabbs\nas a whole. Too few students currently\ncare about the Union, and in particular the Union Council, believing that it\ndoes little to bene\ufb01t them other than\nrunning the clubs and societies and\nthe bars and swaddling everything they\ndo in red tape. Indeed what does the\nDP(W) and DP(E) actually do on a day\nto day basis? Send a few emails, go to\na few meetings? What cold, hard progress has been made over the last couple of years? Indeed, can anyone name\neither of these DPs from two years ago?\nSome people still don\u2019t know who the\ncurrent ones are. Surely this campaign\nis a chance for them to prove that they\nare worth the combined \u00a332K that they\ncost all of us every year; a chance for\nthem to actually make a huge di\ufb00erence to the future students.\nhis campaign, with the whole\nweight of the Union and Felix behind\nit, is surely a massive opportunity for\nthem to show to the next generation\nof Sabbs that it is worth running for\nthese positions in the Big Elections\nthis year as you can actually make an\nimpact.\nYours,\nA Concerned Undergrad\n---Dear Sir,\nI am somewhat bemused by the approximate costs for the proposed halls\nin North Acton. As has correctly been\npointed out by the Student\u2019s Union\n(\u201che maximum annual maintenance\nloan for London is \u00a37675. 39 weeks at\nActon would be roughly \u00a35900 \u2013 excluding travel costs.\u201d), and considering the price of a Zones 1-2 Student\nTravelcard is \u00a3848, thus bringing the\ntotal cost of the hall to approximately\n\u00a37000, it raises the possibility that\nthose who are su\ufb03ciently well o\ufb00\nenough to not qualify for the means\ntested part of the maintenance loan\nmay be priced out of these halls.\nWhilst I am aware that savvy students could save money by purchasing monthly travel cards, this does not\nnegate the fact that you either have\nto be at the bottom end of the system\n(and thus qualify for a 100% loan) or\nhave signi\ufb01cant funding from other\nsources to a\ufb00ord these new halls. As\nI suspect the latter will no doubt apply for Southside and Eastside, and\nthe former may be tempted by Pembridge Hall or (depending on cost after re-opening) Wilson House due to\nthe shorter commute, I can\u2019t help but\nwonder who Campus Services are targeting the new hall of residence at.\nSince all customers are either priced\nout, have more \ufb01nancially and logically favourable options, or can simply\na\ufb00ord to pay more for better, it does\nraise the prospect that the only selling point for this hall is \u2018You Have No\nOther Choice\u2019. As this form of selling\nseems somewhat strange, I would be\nmost interested if Campus Services\nwas able to enlighten us, maybe as a\nletter here in Felix, as to who exactly\nthey predict will live in this hall, and\ntheir reasons for it.\nYours,\nA Bemused Reader\nf a \ufb01rst year lives in North\nActon, they are going to\nspend at least 90 minutes a\nday traveling back and forth\nbetween South Kensington and their halls. As the courses at\nImperial College London are already\nknown to have a high workload, our\nfuture students are going to \ufb01nd this\nincredibly painful and I expect more\nfirst years will drop out when they\nare going through the transition of\na school mentality to that of what is\nneeded to complete an Imperial de-gree. I predict that these students\nwill engage less with the student\ncommunity, fewer will do Horizons,\nwhich will ultimately lead to them not\nbeing a well-rounded student and\nless employable.\nI also expect the lecture attendance\nwill drop signi\ufb01cantly for any \ufb01rst\nyears that live in North Acton, for example I doubt the lecture turnout on\nWednesday mornings is going to be as\nhigh for those that are lucky enough\nto live in South Kensington. his is\ngoing to leave a gap in some students\u2019\nknowledge of their discipline and I am\nworried more students may fail their\nexams and get lower marks due to\nthis.\nFurthermore, the students that are\nliving in South Kensington will be able\nto access the 24-hour central library\nat practically all hours with just a six\nminute walk to Eastside, while students will have to get 2 night buses\nback to North Acton when the underground stops running. It seems a\nmassive shame to me that less of our\nstudents will be able to access one of\nImperial\u2019s greatest resources, which\nthe students think most highly of.\nI know the Union does not represent academic sta\ufb00 but I really don\u2019t\nenvy any of the undergraduate admissions tutors who will have to sell\nImperial to prospective applicants, on\nthe fact that there is a good chance\nthey will have to pay around \u00a36,500\non accommodation and travel, while\nthey receive a sub-standard student\nexperience. In the latest UCAS data,\nthe biggest reason for students declining an o\ufb00er was the cost of living. his\ndata doesn\u2019t even take into account\nthe students who didn\u2019t apply in the\n\ufb01rst place and I envisage that more applicable students won\u2019t want to come\nto Imperial due to this recent develop-ment.\nI mean, seriously what is the point\nof paying members of College sta\ufb00 in\nOutreach and Recruitment, while telling the O\ufb03ce For Fair Access (OFFA)\nthat we are doing our part on widening participation, so we can charge\nthe \u00a39,000 fees, if we just segregate\nthe cash rich students from the others\nand deter talented applicants from ap-plying, who just simply cannot a\ufb00ord\nit? How are we supposed to attract\nthe best talent from across the globe\nif we can\u2019t even manage it in our own\ncountry?\nSo as you can see, I am clearly\n#AgainstActon and I urge every student reading this to let your academic\nreps know that you are too.\nWe want your\nthoughts.\nEach week, the\nbest letter to the\nEditor will get\n\u00a310\nEmail:\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nOr submit\nanonymously at:\nfelixonline.co.uk\nI\n\u201c\u201d\n... future\nstudents are\ngoing to find\nthis incredibly\npainful\n\n"

Co\ufb00ee shops,\nrestaurants, print shop, newsagent and\nbars (all run by College) are duplicating services normally found on campus\nand just extorting more money from\nstudents. Eastside 2.0. On the \ufb02ip side,\ninclusion of these service at least shows\nthat College is aware that the hall is too\nfar away for South Kensington to be\nuseful for students\u2026\n\u201cSimon Harding-Roots, Chief Operations O\ufb03cer at Imperial College, said:\n\u201che quality and design of this development will be outstanding.

Imperial XC members had been\nup all week to prepare for the event,\nand were impatient to show the results of their winter training.\nOn D-day, after only a few hours\nsleep for many due to last minute\npreparations, the course was set up in\nHyde Park and Kensington Gardens,\nour usual training playground. he\nmen\u2019s route was about 5.2km, to be\nrun by six people (unless you\u2019re Milan\nMisak and want to wear 6 numbers\non your vest for a mere 31km jog \u2013\nhero!), while the women\u2019s team had 4\nlaps of 3.5km to complete.\nhe men\u2019s race got underway at\n14:00 under pleasant weather for run-ners, the rain having just stopped.\nWomen followed 5 minutes later, and\ntourists could admire about 100 runners doing their best to place their\nteam. Women came back \ufb01rst to pass\nto the next leg, while the next runners\nwere either warming up or cheering\ncompatriots in a friendly atmosphere.\nOn the men\u2018s side, despite tenta-tives by Cambridge and St. Mary\u2019s,\nthe \ufb01rst leg was clearly dominated\nby Imperial\u2019s Chris Bannon, thanks\nto a very intelligent acceleration after\nstaying behind in the \ufb01rst windy part.\nHe even had time for the Michu cel-ebration, snatching the fastest time of\nthe day in an impressive 15\u201942\u2019\u2019. his\nleft time to change vest and start his\nsecond leg for Medics\u2019 team, just a bit\nslower this time!\nSadly the lead was lost a few kilometers later with Chris homas unable to \ufb01ght o\ufb00 the machine-like St.\nMary\u2019s team, while Cambridge and\nOxford came up to take 2nd and 3rd.\nFresher Liam Smith (who later ran\ntwo supplementary legs for his hall\nteams), third year Chris Charles and\nJean-Claude Besse followed, taking\nthe next three legs as fast as they possibly could to avoid the return of St.\nMary\u2019s 2. Imperial was still in 4th before last leg, the exact position they\ntook in 2010 and 2011. Men\u2019s Captain\nJames Ellis \ufb01nally crosses the \ufb01nish\nline in 5th overall position, but satis\ufb01ed given the very high level of competition this year. Congratulations to\nthe other IC XC teams who all \ufb01nished in the top half and particularily\nto Milan Misak who completed all 6\nlegs himself!\nIn the women\u2019s race, Imperial XC\nhad a record 4 teams in a \ufb01eld of nearly 50 teams. It was up to recent american import Melissa Newton-Mora to\nstart o\ufb00 the girls bid: improve on last\nyears 7th position. She did an impressive job to \ufb01nish in the main pack\nalong with Cambridge, Oxford, Bristol and St Marys University in a time\nof 12.39. Imogen Keane then stormed\nout to try and retain our position followed by Eileen Brandley, it was then\nup to Sophie Kirk to lead the team\nhome after leaving her marshalling\npost just 5 minutes prior it was always\ngoing to be an interesting race. With\na cry of \u201cIm going to get her\u201d (Oxford\nBrookes was in sight), the Captain\nset o\ufb00 in hot pursuit. Having caught\nBrookes at the bridge it was all about\nthe pb and holding o\ufb00 any further\nteams. Oxford (the real one) were\ntoo strong this time but the \ufb01rst team\nstill \ufb01nished in and incredible 6th\nposition, up one on last year! Other\ngreat performances were by Harveen\nHayer, Kimberley Mason and Lauren\nStanley who are all new to the club!\nOnce marshalling and course taking\ndown jobs were complete (which included jumping over fences in closed\nparks, pushing a trolley all around\nHyde Park at dusk, and deciding\nagainst carrying away a big \u201cMetropolitan Police \u2013 wet paint\u201d sign as\nwell), we joined the team in the SCR\nfor (much needed) jacket potatoes\nand the prize giving ceremony. St.\nMary\u2019s took both men and women\nexternal \ufb01rst places, while both internal catergories were awarded to\nImperial Triathlon. Fastest legs were\nChris Bannon (ICXC, 15\u201942\u2019\u2019) and\nSophia Saller (Oxford, 12\u201904\u2019\u2019) in the\nWomen\u2019s.\nAfter a quick shower, Imperial\nCross Country Club \u2018ran\u2019 to the Union\nand later Metric, for yet another night\nof post race celebration. Competition\nspirit took over some teams, who are\nstill disputing the victory in a boat\nrace and who actually participated...\n(it will always be IC in our hearts)!\nFreshers were also introduced to the\nHyde Park Relays Horn (the old boys\nshowed us how it was done), while\nsome had the privilege to take the DJ\u2019s\nspot in Metric. he job was not quite\n\ufb01nished at that point, since people\nhad been assigned to sleep over at the\nUnion to steward foreign runners, or\nwere in charge of having rooms clean\non time the next day. But who cares?\nhe music was on, facepaint for all\nICXC members, a good night worth\nremembering (for those who can!).\nTo be short, compared to BUCS\nlast week, you can replace \u201cpainful\nsteps in the mud\u201d by \u201c\ufb02ying on the\nroad\u201d, hilly by \ufb02at, long journey by\na run home; whilst keeping the fun\nand competitive level (of both racing\nand partying!). And as a triathlete I\nhad images of the Brownlee brothers\nrushing along the Serpentine during\nlast summer\u2019s Olympics.\nAnd \ufb01nally, a huge thanks (certainly\nfrom all satis\ufb01ed 500+ runners) to\nco-organisers Matt Douthwaite and\nMing Wang-Koh, hopefully we, the\nICXC team, did a good job to help\nyou out, but your organisation made\nHyde Park Relays 2013 an awesome\nevent which every runner at any level\nwithin Imperial College just had to\njoin!\nI would.\n#YOLO!\nIt\u2019s overly photogenic Vicki!

Acton. Acton. Everybody\u2019s going on about\nActon. he word\u2019s lost\nall meaning, now representing some Mordoresque land of ruination and desolation.\nTreats such as the London Transport\nMuseum Depot (that\u2019s right folks, de-pot!) may await Acton a\ufb01cionados but\nthe possible plans to close Evelyn Gardens and ship 700 or so Freshers beyond West\ufb01eld haven\u2019t been that well\nreceived by students, to say the least.\nSo, in our in\ufb01nite wisdom, we\u2019ve decided to lend a hand and recommend a\nfew new locations which would doubtless be better received.\nThe Scottish Highlands\nIf you\u2019re going to banish students to\nZone 3, then you need to go the whole\nhog and \ufb02ing them to the other end\nof the UK. Enjoying renewed tourist interest because of Daniel Craig\u2019s\nMacaulay Culkin-inspired rampage\nin last year\u2019s Skyfall, the rolling landscapes and greenish-brown vistas\nwould be perfectly suited to a new\nhall of residence; not only because of\nthe prime development land on o\ufb00er,\nbut because of how singularly di\ufb03cult\nit would be to travel to College. Who\nwouldn\u2019t enjoy a twenty hour round\ntrip for two hours of lectures \u2013 daily!\nhat said, you could take the opportunity to recreate quintessential Sunday\nevening viewing Monarch of the Glen,\nbut for real. Go Laird or go home.\nHeathrow Airport\nOne of the big touted positives of the\nproposed accommodation in Acton is\nthe close proximity to Heathrow, especially since that if there\u2019s one thing\nFreshers enjoy, it\u2019s regularly hopping\non the Piccadilly Line and going to\nVenezuela with their in\ufb01nite bank bal-ance. his could, of course, be solved\nby just building some new rooms right\nthere in the airport. You\u2019d have bars\nalready in place for one, along with\nprime duty free shopping. Students\nwould have the time to run backwards\nalong those charming \ufb02at escalators,\nbeating any Ethos treadmill. I imagine one could also engage in some\nwacky adventures, such as becoming\nacquainted with airport sta\ufb00 and scoring free plane tickets to America and\nvisiting MIT to see what lecture podcasting is actually like.\nA\nIf you want to experience the\nFelix Oice \ufb01rst hand, drop us an email.\nWe always need writers, illustrators,\nphotographers and probably more.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nSouth America\nYeah, that\u2019s right, the whole continent.\nJust parachute Freshers in and see\nhow they get on. Life Science students\ncould at the very least take advantage\nof the outstanding biodiversity. hose\nof a more business and criminally\nminded persuasion could have a crack\nat one of the Colombian drug cartels.\nThe Moon\nSpace is ace. Everyone loves it. Loads\nof room for scienti\ufb01c discovery. Surely\nthere\u2019s a little bit of overlap with Imperial\u2019s purview? Yeah that\u2019s right, I\u2019m\nsaying that we should build a campus on the moon. Student satisfaction would literally skyrocket and you\nwouldn\u2019t even need to go to South Ken\n\u2013 unless you\u2019re a medic I guess. But\nof course, for those career \ufb01ends out\nthere, it\u2019d be the ultimate CV booster,\nbeing an astronaut and all. Heck, you\nprobably wouldn\u2019t even have to take\npart in any cringeworthy telephone\ninterviews where the signal\u2019s so terrible you can\u2019t even hear the questions.\nGeneric Conclusion\nSo let\u2019s just ditch this whole #Pray-ForActon campaign and set our sights\nbeyond the M25. he sky\u2019s the limit!\nhere\u2019s a whole world out there just\nwaiting for another hall of residence\nand 700 students and if we simply restrict our view to Zone 3, then we\u2019re\nsimply missing out.\n\n"

All that can be said\nis that it\u2019s brilliant. Absolutely bril-liant. Here is a \ufb01lm of unimaginable\nscale and ambition, six (and maybe an\nextra half) di\ufb00erent narrative strands\nall put together and connected beautifully with endless smart editing, a true\nwork of wonder that needs to be seen.\nIt would be a crime to miss this masterpiece on the big screen.\nSouth Paci\ufb01c Ocean, 1849; Adam\nEwing (Sturgess), an American lawyer\nworking for his father-in-law (Weav-ing), witnesses the whipping of a black\nslave (Gyasi), who he later \ufb01nds hiding on his ship. he two strike up an\nunlikely friendship, whilst the sinister Dr Henry Goose (Hanks) lurks in\nthe background interested in Ewing\u2019s\nwealth and fortune.\nEdinburgh, Scotland, 1936; told\nthrough many love letters from Robert Frobisher (Whishaw) to Rufus Sixsmith (D\u2019Arcy), we follow Frobisher,\na young, enthusiastic, bisexual musician who is hired as an amanuensis to\nfamous, highly respected composer,\nVyvyan Ayrs (Broadbent). Frobisher\nJohn Park Film Editor\nhimself ends up composing a brilliant\npiece of music too, and is left shocked\nand dumbfounded when Ayrs wants to\ntake credit for the young apprentice\u2019s\nwork.\nSan Francisco, California, 1973;\njournalist Luisa Rey (Berry) stumbles\nupon what could be the biggest news\nstory and scandal of her career, going\nafter a corrupt energy company. With\nsome unexpected help from a couple of its employees (Hanks, D\u2019Arcy),\nLuisa gets closer to the truth, which\ndoesn\u2019t sit well with the CEO (Grant).\nUnited Kingdom, 2012; publisher\nTimothy Cavendish (Broadbent) becomes an overnight sensation after\nhis gangster author Dermot Hoggins\n(Hanks) impulsively throws a harsh\nbook critic o\ufb00 a building. His book\nbecomes a bestseller, and Cavendish\nstarts pocketing the cash, but not before Hoggins\u2019 \ufb01erce associates come\nlooking for their share in the pro\ufb01ts.\nAlthough he turns to his older brother (Grant) for help, he \ufb01nds himself\nlocked up in a \u201cretirement home\u201d\nruled by the tyrannical Nurse Noakes\n(Weaving).\nNeo Seoul, Korea, 2144; Sonmi-451\n(Bae) is a fabricant created solely for\nthe purpose of serving humans. Now\nas a captured prisoner giving her \ufb01nal\ninterview before her inevitable execu-tion, she recounts the days that lead to\nher arrest, starting with her encounter\nwith Hae-Joo Chang (Sturgess) a rebel\n\ufb01ghter leading the resistance against\ncurrent society, their noble \ufb01ght, leading to her startling discovery behind\nher creation.\nA tropical island, 2321; set \u201c106 winters after he Fall\u201d, most of humanity\nhas gone back to living in a primitive\nsociety. Zachry (Hanks) is constantly\nplagued by visions of Old Georgie\n(Weaving), a dark spirit that taunts his\nconscience. he arrival of Meronym\n(Berry), a member of the \u201cPrescients\u201d,\nwho have held onto advanced technology even during/after he Fall, sends\nexcitement and a hint of worry to the\ntribesmen, as her intentions aren\u2019t too\nclear. Also living with the fear of being attacked/eaten by the cannibalistic Kona tribe, Zachry must make\nthe smart decision of whether to trust\nMeronym or not.\nSo there you have it, six completely\ndi\ufb00erent plot strands, covering a wide\nrange of genres (you get everything:\naction, adventure, comedy, drama,\nfantasy, horror, romance, sci-\ufb01, thrill-er), touching on too many themes to\nlist individually here. How do they all\n\ufb01t together? Is it even possible to link\n500 years of material? Yes you can, and\nyou\u2019ll have to watch to \ufb01nd out how.\nBut what is impressive is how the\n\ufb01lm itself is never bogged down by its\ndense material. he structure is clear,\nthe many characters, even in their\nshort appearances, are well-developed,\nand the actors who are reused again\nand again throughout the \ufb01lm inhabit\ntheir roles perfectly in the many varied roles they play. It is hard to pick out\njust a few from this fantastic international group, as the cast all bring their\nA-game as they are put through centuries and centuries of events.\nhe actors frequently change their\nrace and their gender (seriously),\nthanks to some incredible work done\nin the make-up department. It\u2019s also\nfun to play a little game of who\u2019s who,\ntrying to dissect the heavy prosthetic\nmake-up hiding their faces.\nWhat we have here is no doubt an\nexample of hyperlink cinema, and\nmuch like the greatest of this sub-gen-re (Pulp Fiction, Babel, Crash, Magnolia, Traffic, City of God, 21 Grams, to\nname a few), Cloud Atlas excels in establishing the crucial links, more challenging here since the directors are\ncovering 500 years\u2019 worth of narrative,\nas well as rounding o\ufb00 every segment\nwith a rewarding emotional punch.\nhe soundtrack also plays a crucial\nrole in these key moments, each \ufb01nale\nincorporating an immense piece of\nexhilarating music, some composed\nby Tykwer himself\nDon\u2019t be put o\ufb00 by how very little\n\ufb01nancial success this experienced in\nthe States. For whatever reason, this\ndidn\u2019t go down well with audiences\nthere. But here is hoping Europe can\ndo better. Find the biggest screen, the\nloudest speakers you possibly can, and\nenjoy.\nStudent fails viva\nPracticing\ntheir sucking\ntechniques.\nInterpret as you\nwish...\nBeing slow clapped\nis never fun\nShipwrecked student.\nStill closer than Paragon\nFringes in eyes are\nso annoying\n\u201cWhat do you mean the notes\nwon\u2019t be on Blackboard?\u201d\n\n"

But when\nDie Hard 4.0 (aka Live Free or Die\nHard) was a bit rubbish, this one was\nbound to be equally shoddy. Which it\nwas.\nAfter the \ufb01rst three Die Hard \ufb01lms\ntied up the loose ends of a good trilogy pretty damn tightly, why anyone\nthough the fourth \ufb01lm was a good\nidea is beyond me, let alone the \ufb01fth.\nClearly a classic case of making sure\nthe premise is squeezed for as much\ncash as possible \u2013 plus, of course, a\nchance for old Bruce to stretch his\nlegs.\nIn all fairness, director John Moore\ndoes his best, despite his back catalogue being a list of remakes such\nas he Omen and game adaptations\nlike Max Payne. here is a small improvement on the messy Die Hard\n4.0; Moore does have the edge on Len\nWiseman, and the CGI e\ufb00ects and\nstunts are a bit neater. However, taking the story outside of the USA was\nnot a good idea, and hasn\u2019t done the\n\ufb01lmmakers any favours. Russia is a bit\nold school for this type of \ufb01lm, really.\nRandomly placing jokes associated with the Cold War just aren\u2019t\nclear to everyone and raise less than\na few titters from the audience. McClane\u2019s enthusiasm for going abroad\nto \u2018kill all the scumbags\u2019 seems a little too much, and loses the character any last shreds of respect he was\nclinging to \u2013 not to mention the fact\nthat, when he gets abroad, he is not\nquite sure who the \u2018scumbags\u2019 are.\nhe chases through a snow-covered\nMoscow are like a poor attempt at\nan American James Bond, and the\nsomewhat drawn out climax is littered with clich\u00e9s of helicopters and\ndisinterested gun\ufb01ght.\nConsidering the poor sod is going\nthrough the same pile of crap for the\n\ufb01fth time, Bruce Willis is, I guess,\nstill quite enthusiastic. Much more\nthan I would be his situation, that\u2019s\nfor sure. But that doesn\u2019t make up for\nthe mess made of the well thought out\nsystem that made the \ufb01rst three \ufb01lms\nwork: for a successful Die Hard, you\nneed a hero (McClane, obviously), a\nfamily member in danger, a bad guy\nand a sidekick. In this \ufb01fth Die Hard,\nthis pattern has been messed up.\nhe family member and the sidekick\nhave been combined into one whiny\nirritating character \u2013 McClane\u2019s secret agent son \u2013 who intersperses\nthe breaks between plot twists and\ngun \ufb01ghts with annoying father-son\nbonding.\nhe best part of Die Hard was always the key relationship between\ntrigger-happy McClane and a tech-savvy, hugely intelligent evil master-mind. his was already buggered up\nin Die Hard 4.0, but it was made even\nworse in this latest \ufb01lm \u2013 the bad\nguys are now Russians we barely see,\nand hence can\u2019t work up that much\nanger towards. Another let down is\nthat any \ufb01nal ditch attempt at excitement brought on by violence has been\nwell and truly doused in order to be\nsure of that 12A rating.\nFrankly, I really wouldn\u2019t bother.\nA Good Day to Die\nHard\nDirector: John Moore\nScreenwriter: Skip Woods\nStarring: Bruce Willis, Jai Courtney,\nSebastian Koch, Mary Elizabeth\nWinstead\nWhile the hype is slowly building for\nthe con\ufb01rmed Jurassic Park 4 movie,\naudiences worldwide are trying to\ncontain themselves, and hoping for\nanother classic gem. However, producer Frank Marshall con\ufb01rmed that\nKathleen Kennedy \u2013 his co-producer\nfor the last three Jurassic \ufb01lms \u2013 will\nnot be involved in the project, owing to\nher commitment to the new Star Wars\nmovie that is due from Disney. A fan\nhad asked Marshall on Twitter about\nthe extent of Kennedy\u2019s involvement,\nhe wittily tweeted: \u201cNo, Ms. Kennedy\nhas moved onto Star Wars and will not\nbe producing JP4. She\u2019s traded raptors\nfor TIE \ufb01ghters.\u201d\nAt the moment, there has been very\nlittle o\ufb03cial information leaked about\nJurassic Park 4; the cast, plot and \ufb01lming location all remain \ufb01rmly under\nWith the 85th Academy Awards ceremony a mere two days away, the\nsprint to the \ufb01nish line is one of the\nclosest ever this year.

Russell to the post to scoop\nthe prestigious Best Adapted Screenplay award from the Writers\u2019 Guild of\nAmerica this week \u2013 with that lineup representing the majority of the\nfrontrunners for the Oscars this year.\nAlso coming up to the front is\nZero Dark hirty, whose writer Mark\nBoal beat John Gatins (Flight) and\nPaul homas Anderson (he Master) alongside other top class writers\nto bag the Best Original Screenplay\naward. his news was surely very\nwelcome for the team behind the Bin\nLaden hunt thriller, as the controversy surrounding the movie was initially looking as though it might damage\nits chances of winning the big time\nawards. In his acceptance speech, a\nclearly delighted Boal praised Zero\nDark hirty\u2019s director, saying: \u201cYou\ntook this script, and you made it live\nand breathe and \ufb02y, and you led all\nof us un\ufb02inchingly and bravely to a\nplace of truth and beauty.\u201d\nUK Top 10 Box Office\n1) A Good Day to Die\nHard \u2013 12A \u2013 Bruce Willis,\nJai Courtney\n2) Wreck-It Ralph \u2013\nPG \u2013 John C.

While Ang Lee\u2019s\nLife of Pi cleaned up nicely, taking\nthe accolade of Best Sound Editing\nof Dialogue and ADR as well as Best\nSound Editing of Music in a Feature\nFilm, hot on its heels was the hugely\npopular Les Miserables \u2013 which, not\nsurprisingly, won the award for Best\nSound Editing of Music in a Musical.

So place your bets \u2013\nbut it\u2019s anyone\u2019s race.\nwraps. As far as we are aware, no director has been chosen and the script\nis still being tweaked.

Jurassic\nPark will be re-released in IMAX 3D\nin April 2013 \u2013 and is obviously going\nto stir up a lot of excitement for the upcoming fourth \ufb01lm.\nIn the meantime, we shall leave you\nwith this picture to whet your appetites\u2026 http://memebase.cheezburger.\ncom/puns/tag/dinosaur\nWhy won\u2019t you just die?\nThe Wanted recruit new members\nFelix\u2019s award cabinet\n\n"

Regardless of cultural\nbackground and language barriers, all\ndenizens of the internet can recognise\nthe trait these characters are supposed to represent, getting remarkably speci\ufb01c at times.\nNot only do these characters help\nexpress emotions and situations better than words could, they also allow\neveryone to tell their own version of\nthe story. Again, this is not dissimilar\nto the artists of the past giving their\npersonal rendition of mythological or\nBible tales: any given event can be retold in di\ufb00erent ways, and because all\nmacros and images are public domain\nand easily modi\ufb01able, sharing them is\nvery easy.\nhis is perhaps the greatest achievement of the internet culture: the establishment of a common language, a\ncommon set of rules and conventions.\nArt has helped the spread of ideas\nthroughout the ages thanks to its ability to entertain as well as educate,\nand much progress has been had due\nto art making people come together.\nWhile memes obviously cannot do\nthis in the same capacity, they do o\ufb00er\na convenient, bite-sized, standardised\ntool to communicate, and this shared\nculture can do many great things.\nhere are misogynistic memes, and\nracist ones, and an o\ufb03cial mascot for\npaedophilia, that\u2019s true: when given\nanonymity, many will turn to their\ndark side. But they are merely a few\nof the possible expressions of the in-ternet, which, by and large, are of\ncreativity, ingenuity, cleverness and\nhumour. Memes can be the shared\nlanguage that the web needs to talk to\neach other on level pegging, and they\nshould be treated with respect.\nExcept for Dolan. hat thing is an\nabomination.\nPietro Aronica\nM\nDriving Lessons For Imperial Students\n\u2022A special offer for Imperial students\nfrom Denis Smyth\n\u2022Driving Standards Agency (DSA)\nAccredited Instructor\n\u2022Mock Test Examiner\n5 Driving Lessons for\n\u00a395\n\"Denis is a fantastic teacher and knows how to get people from completely\ninexperienced and utterly hopeless driving up to the standard to pass their test.

The ground-breaking\nnew concept whereby people venture to the \u2018shop\u2019 and spend money on\nitems they wish to purchase has been enthuastically announced by Google\nspokesperson. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic new technology and we feel people are going to\nlove it\u201d stated the spokesperson before adding \u201cyou can find the locations on\nthe internet, just use Bing to find it\u201d.\nThere is a world beyond South Kensington...\nPM to spend the rest of tenure single-handily tackling corruption in India\nAfter assuring the Indian Prime Minister,\nManmohan Singh, that he would help them\ntackle the issue, David Cameron donned the\nfirst of many potential disguises, slipped out of\nthe press conference and began to investigate\ncorruption from the bottom up. Just before\nmelting away into the crowd, Cameron\nstated that he would \u201cdeal with the\nAgustaWestland company\u201d but added\nthat it \u201cwon\u2019t be before I\u2019ve tackled\nthe whole rotten system\u201d. Rumours\nthat the PM has been simultaneously\nsighted in Dehli, New Dehli, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Chennai are, as\nyet, unconfirmed.\nThe hope that the Charing Cross A&E\ndepartment was to be saved has been\noverturned after the official meeting\nwas held on February 19. This comes\nafter speculation that the A&E department was going to remain open as a\nsmaller A&E.\nAndy Slaughter, Hammersmith and\nFulham Labour MP, announced that\nthe A&E department of Charing Cross,\nHammersmith, Central Middlesex and\nEaling hospitals would be closed. He\nstated that this decision would mean\nthat \u201cCharing Cross Hospital will be\ndemolished and most of the site sold\nfor private development\u201d.\nHe also added that the \u201cNHS use of\nthe site will be 3% of current levels. All\n500 beds at Charing Cross will go and\nall acute services will be lost\u201d.\nThis means that all \u2018blue light\u2019 emergencies will be diverted to other hospitals and that there will be no A&E\ndepartment in the London boroughs of\nHammersmith, Ealing and Brent.\nThe replacement to the closure of the\nA&E department will be \u2018Urgent Care\nCentres\u2019 (UCC) at each of the hospi-tals.

This\nwould mean that current medical students might not be affected by these\nchanges.\nThe Shaping a Healthier Future programme stated that it would be \u2018Investing over \u00a3190m more in out-of-hospital\ncare to improve community facilities\nand the care provided by GPs and oth-ers. Most of these improvements will\nbe put in place before any major changes to local hospitals are made\u2019.\nJeff Zitron, Chair of the Joint Committee of Primary Care Trusts (JCPCT),\nsaid: \u201cThis is an important decision for\nthe NHS in NW London. I am delighted that, after thorough and careful ex-amination, we are able to fully recommend what clinicians feel will deliver\nthe best possible care for local people\nfor years to come. We have not taken\nthis decision lightly, and have been\nvery careful to consider the many thousands of responses we received during\nour extensive consultation last summer.\nI am confident that this is the best decision for the people of North West London and for the NHS.\u201d\nA statement released by Imperial\nCollege said that: \u2018Imperial College\nHealthcare NHS Trust and Imperial\nCollege London welcome the decision\nto move forward with the plans to reconfigure health services in North West\nLondon.\u2019\nIt also mentioned that \u2018Throughout\nthis process, we have also maintained\nthe importance of the Academic Health\nScience Centre\u2019s mission to link up ed-ucation, research and front line health-care.
