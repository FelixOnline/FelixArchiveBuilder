    "content": "fashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n22 felix Friday 11 January 2008\nFashion\nFashion Editor \u2013 Sarah Skeete\nAnother year, another look\nE\nveryone at the Felix has just\nabout recovered from New\nYear, dragged themselves\ndown into the office, and are\nnow groggily typing out the\nfirst issue of 2008. Exam period is upon\nall at Imperial, and our beloved Sarah\nhas sacrificed Felix Fashion for the sake\nof her degree. The cheek! Being a first\nyear (and a Biologist), I\u2019ll be stepping\nin for the next few weeks. However,\nSarah will be back once she\u2019s finished\nscrawling maths equations onto bits of\npaper in silence.\nWhen a new year comes round, every\npublication across the globe puts out\nthe obligatory \u201cWhat\u2019s In and What\u2019s\nOut\u201d feature for the upcoming year.\nYou\u2019ll be glad to know I\u2019m going to do\nsomething different this time; \u201cWhat\u2019s\nOut and What\u2019s In\u201d for 2008.\nThe Spring 2008 collections bring\nup nothing that you\u2019d run to the shops\nfor the moment you read this, but the\n\u201cOuts\u201d of this year are ones I personally wholly agree with. Astrobright Footwear have had far too long in the spotlight during 2007. If you\u2019re not familiar\nwith the brand, they are responsible\nfor the ground-laden eyesores that are\n\u201cCrocs\u201d. This year, no more should we\nsee B-list celebrities prancing around in\nthese fluorescent slipper-welly things,\ntrying to gain some quirky recognition\nthat they couldn\u2019t get without wearing ridiculous footwear. To be honest,\nI\u2019m not sure Crocs were even \u2018in\u2019. They\nhave nothing going for them. \u201cThey\u2019re\ncomfortable\u201d I hear you scream. When\nhas being fashionable ever mean being\ncomfortable? \u201cBut they\u2019re so versatile!\u201d\nyou sob in desperation. Do they look\ngood with formal wear? No. Do they\nlook good with casual wear? No. Do\nthey look good when you\u2019re naked?\nNo, unless you\u2019re Heidi Klum. Point\nDaniel Wan envisages what trends are going to be big, and which bad, this new year\nhave a slight schoolboy charm about\nthem. Sadly, you\u2019re probably going to\nhave to wait till May at the very earliest\nnot to look like a complete lunatic in\nnear sub-zero temperatures.\nMy pick of the new concepts for\n2008 though, is the shawl collar on\nmen\u2019s blazers. The casual blazer will\nbe transformed with new lapels usually\nfound on a classic tuxedo jacket. A fitted grey suit with a glossy black shawl\ncollar, black fitted shirt and skinny tie\nis the look to go for this year. Nowhere\nto put your Poppy come Remembrance\nDay though.\nFinally, we get to the shiny stuff. Brass\nbuttons are making their way back. I\nhave a feeling a degree of naval fashion will appear this year. Don\u2019t worry\nthough, we won\u2019t all be walking around\nlooking like sailors, stripes and all, but\nsolid brass buttons, possibly on a double breasted navy blue jacket, could be\nthe new look for pseudo-formal men\u2019s\nwear.\nWomen\u2019s accessory-wise, chunky\njewellery takes the lead over subtle and\ndainty jewellery. Larger bracelet bands\nand earrings, with care, can finish your\noutfit and leave everyone breathless.\nWord on the street, if you count\nfinding stray pages from Vogue littered\nacross Exhibition Road, is that stars are\ngoing to be very much part of the aesthetic of 2008. Star-shaped accessories\nwill make an appearance on the high\nstreet. A mix of 2008 vibrancy and this\nnew motif should cut a sharp image.\nPrada\u2019s range of suede watches add\nanother aspect of colour to the new\nseason. With a range of assorted childlike colours, and at \u00a3125 each, these\ncould make a perfect New Year\u2019s treat.\nYou definitely deserve one after all that\nrevising (procrasinating, giving up and\ngoing out) you did over Christmas.\nproven.\nWith what you\u2019ve got on your feet on\nyour mind, you might want to avoid\nthe other \u2018no-no\u2019 of 2008; logos and\nlabels. Showing off what you\u2019re wearing is not acceptable this year, which\nis great news for Primark fanatics and\nbad for high-end clothes labels.\n2008 may bring subtlety in branding,\nbut not in colour. It\u2019s all about dashes\nof vibrancy in your wear; whether it\nbe a bright but solid jumper and tie\nunderneath your otherwise dull grey\nwork-suit, or pair of vivid jazz shoes\nwith your usual casual wear. Vibrancy\nJanuary Sales\nYou\u2019ve hit the post-Christmas\nsales hard, and your bank\nbalance is now comfortably in\nthe red. Your new top and skirt\nwere both 50% off, and you\nlook stunning in them; your\noverdraft is there for a reason.\nI love the sales!\nUrban Outfitters UK\nAfter a visit to the US, the\nUK\u2019s plain and preppy men\u2019s\nsection stands limp beside\nits American counterpart.\nThere\u2019s a serious lack of real\nstandout style for the price\nyou\u2019re paying at Urban Outfitters UK. Screw Oxford Street,\nhead over to 42nd Street,\nManhattan.\nAmy Winehouse\nWe get it, you\u2019re off your face,\nand your husband\u2019s in jail,\nyou\u2019re rock-and-roll; Go you!\nHer ever-enlarging beehive\nmonstrosity is so 2007. If\nshe spent the time grooming\nherself in rehab, she might\nactually be famous for more\nthan being a complete wreck.\nMake use of 2008, love.\nCOOL\nLAME\nmeans print dresses are definitely in,\nespecially featuring flowers or abstract\nprints. A hint of holiday-in-the-Carib-bean might well brighten up London\u2019s\ncold winter evenings. Nevertheless,\nthis isn\u2019t an excuse to go out dressed as\na nu-rave Hadouken! fan anymore.\nMen, prepare to getting used to looking a little bit silly this year. Cropped\ntrousers are set to be completely raped\nand ruined by Topman, so get in early\nand let those ankles freeze in British\nmid-winter. They are slightly longer\nthan three-quarter lengths, and when\nworn with a pair of smart leather shoes\nNew for 2008: Vivid print dresses are the new must-have, whilst shawl\ncollars on men\u2019s formalwear makes a suitable change. Geddit?\nIN\nIn the sales bin: (Clockwise from top left) Astrobright\u2019s Crocs, pseudo-formal waistcoat and ties, and blatant Abercrombie & Fitch style\nbranding.\nGreat for two thousand and eight: (Clockwise from left) Cropped\ntrousers come coupled with slender bare ankles, wonderfully bright\nshoes, plus stars, stars and more stars...\nOUT\n\n"

Not only\nwas he a Poet Laureate, but he was a\ndescendant of King Edward the Third.\nAlthough that may not be looked on as\na good thing given the rising amount\nof anti-monarchal feeling in this coun-try. One of his more famous quotations is one which anyone who has suffered heartbreak will have heard- \u201cTis\nbetter to have loved and lost, than to\nnever have loved at all.\u201d Whether this is\ntrue or not, I shall leave you to discuss\namongst yourselves.\nTennyson wrote this poem in 1850\nand although it may be a Christmasthemed poem, it certainly has a ca-thartic, \u2018New year\u2019-sy feel to it as well.\nThe prospect of New Year\u2019s resolutions\nis always a daunting one, especially\nwhen our heads are also swamped with\ncoursework and exams. Or maybe you\nhave no clue as to what you will resolve to do for 2008. Look no further\nthan the poem and heed Lord Alfred\u2019s\nadvice. \u2018Ring out with the old and in\nwith the new; ring in the true.\u2019 Indeed,\ntruth and honesty are important and\ntwo faced-ness should be avoided at all\ncosts.\n\u2018Ring out the grief!\u2019 I know its cold\nand miserable, but come on Britain\nhas always been like this- so stop complaining and imagine yourself somewhere else!\nLord Alfred also offers some politically and socially applicable advice;\n\u2018ring out the feud of rich and poor.\u2019\nClass difference is a terrible thing,\nalthough I think at Imperial we are a\ngood example of integrated diversity.\nGordon Brown take note!\n\u2018Ring out war, ring in peace\u2019... world\npeace, a great notion but will it ever\nhappen? Let us hope so.\nIf this poem has done little to lift your\nspirits, then console yourself with the\nknowledge that you have indulged in\nsome great English Literature. Hmmm\nWilliam Blake\u2019s depiction of Newton\nLeft, The Ghost of a Flea (1819). Right, Jacob\u2019s Ladder (1800)\npoem every justice. Forbes is currently on tour with the play Blackwatch\nwhich has received much acclaim after\nappearing at the Edinburgh Festival in\nSummer 2006.\nTracy Chevalier is most famous for\nher novel Girl With A Pearl Earring,\nbut her latest book (Burning Bright)\nis set in Blake\u2019s London and is the\nstory told through the eyes of Blake\u2019s\nneighbour, who would have been very\nshocked indeed if he had looked over\nthe garden fence to see Mr. and Mrs.\nBlake re-enacting Adam and Eve in\ntheir own \u201cGarden of Eden\u201d! Chevalier\nspent a year researching the eccentric\nBlake before writing a word and so was\nvery well informed in giving us nine\nother interesting and important facts\nabout the poet\u2019s life which would have\nhad a marked effect on his work. Her\nfascinating and well presented speech\nwas followed by a reading of Blake\u2019s\nLondon; judging by his depiction of the\n19th century capital some things have\nnot changed! (\u201c\u2026in every face I meet /\nMarks of weakness, marks of woe\u201d).\nThe next speaker, epic poet Aidan\nAndrew Dun, I had never heard of but\nI bought a book of his poetry, attracted\nlargely by its enticing name \u2013 Salvia\nDivinorum. What I found in it was\nbeautiful poetry, powerful and vivid\nand not completely different to Blake\u2019s\nin some ways. Creating his own perception of Blake\u2019s London, he did not\nso much as speak but bring his poem to\nlife, echoing many themes and images\nfrom across Blake\u2019s poetic repertoire,\nbeginning with the opening lines of\nBlake\u2019s London. His performance was\ncaptivating and meaningful; to best describe him I shall appropriate a phrase\nused by another: \u201cdub troubadour\u201d.\nDavid J, a \u201cpoetic pugilist\u201d, who is one\nof country\u2019s most talented and notorious performance poets, treated us to\nmore performance poetry. At first it\nis unclear which character David J had\ntaken on \u2212 Blake\u2019s neighbour? Blake\u2019s\nbrain? Half-way through his performance I thought that David might have\ntaken on the role of himself as if he\nwere Blake\u2019s friend. That is the beauty\nof Art \u2013 completely open to interpre-tation, one can let the mind run free,\nthere are no right or wrong answers,\nit can be what you want it to be. It is\nhard to put into words the nature of his\nstunning performance, it is in a genre\nall of its own (\u201cstand up poetry\u201d per-haps) and goes beyond the realms of\ntraditional acting.\nAs well as his skill in realising his dia-logue, he exhibits an insight into Blake\nand his poetry which makes it all the\nmore special. Similar to Dun, he echoes\nimages and themes from Blake\u2019s poems\nas well as interjecting a bit of randomness (sound effects and Spanish).\nThe talk, sadly, had to come to an\nend and what better way to finish than\nwith The Tiger. It is a shame that there\nseems to be a slight divide between the\narts and the sciences; they are linked in\nso many instances. As Blake said, \u201cArt\nand science cannot exist but with naked beauty displayed.\u201d\n\n"

Working to improve the situation and representation of black people in the UK,\nthe team\u2019s fragile harmony is shattered\nby the arrival of a new intern.\nManaging to avoid being either self-righteous or polemical, this play is an\ninteresting exploration of how a community deals with perceived victimi-sation. Whatever your own personal\nviews, the tightly written script is sure\nto provoke debate. Yet in seeking to\npack in so many big ideas, the characters inevitably become ciphers for various political and social viewpoints and\nthe audience\u2019s involvement suffers as a\nresult.\nKwaku\u2019s King Lear-like mental disintegration does not quite achieve the\nemotional resonance it aims for, and we\nnever feel enough sympathy towards\nhim for this to be a truly great drama.\nNevertheless, the acting from Colin\nMcFarlane (Michael) and Chu Omambala (Idrissa) in particular is excellent,\nand the dialogue has plenty of wit and\nhumour. Kwame Kwei-Armah clearly\nhas lots to say - this lively and sparky\nproduction means that his future work\nwill be awaited with interest.\nStatement of Regret runs until February 6th 2008, Cotteslowe Theatre at\nthe National Theatre, Southbank.\nDon Warrington plays a convincing Kwaku Mackenzie Life\u2019s a hoot in the office of the Institute for Black Policy\nAudience taken on a trip to Troy\nEmily Steel perseveres despite the flu but is disappointed with what the Greeks have captured\nT\nhe National\u2019s production\nof Women of Troy got five\nstars in The Independent.\nTime Out made it \u2018Critic\u2019s\nChoice\u2019. I tell you this because the night I went to see it, I had\nflu and was dosed up to the eyeballs\non Lemsip Max, which means it\u2019s possible (although unlikely) that my judgement was impaired. I tell you this because I am about to call it pretentious\nrubbish.\nThe original play by Euripides is the\nshocking and powerful story of the\nwomen who are enslaved when the\nGreeks conquer Troy. It sees Hecuba, the queen of Troy, taken with her\ndaughters and her gentlewomen as\nspoils of war, to be shared out among\nthe Greek victors. Most horrifically,\nit features Andromache, Hecuba\u2019s\ndaughter-in-law and the wife of Hector,\nhanding over her baby son so that the\nGreeks can throw him from the battle-ments. If she resists, the child will be\ntaken by force, and the women will not\nbe allowed to bury him. She gives him\nup, and at the end of the play the baby\u2019s\nbody is brought to Hecuba so she may\ndress it for the grave.\nIt\u2019s fairly difficult to make a story like\nthat unmoving, but this production\nmanages it. Directed by Katie Mitchell,\nfrom a version of the play by Don Taylor, this Women of Troy is all gimmicks\nand no heart.\nThe play is set in a dockside ware-house. You hear the noise of seagulls,\nand a big metal door leads out to the\nships. The warehouse is stark, dismal\nand cold. The women imprisoned\nthere wear elegant evening dresses.\nThey swish, they sparkle. They are very\nclearly out of place, snatched from the\nworld they know and thrown into this\none. It\u2019s a point that\u2019s made as soon as\nthe curtain is raised, and the remaining\neighty minutes add very little to it.\nThe characterisations of the women\nare jarring. They twitch and galumph\nabout the stage. They give no sense\nthat they are noblewomen, in their\ndeportment or in their speech. Even\nHecuba, played by Kate Duchene, only\nconveys her authority by booming and\nraving, and as such is unconvincing as\na queen whose throne has lately been\nstolen from her. A queen doesn\u2019t need\nto boom and rave.\nThese women fail to go on any kind\nof emotional journey. They start out at\na high pitch of hysteria and they stay\nthere. At one point, Hecuba declares\n\u201cThere is no agony we don\u2019t already\nfeel, no abyss of pain to discover.\u201d And\nthis is the problem. Lack of discovery\nmakes for dull storytelling. We ought\nto see them plumbing new depths,\nparticularly Hecuba, finally presented\nwith her dead grandson. But we do not.\nWhich isn\u2019t just inhuman; it\u2019s boring.\nI don\u2019t blame the actors. I blame the\ndirector. I blame the director for having them speak the text without feel-ing. I blame the director for choosing\nstyle over substance, for repeatedly\ninserting useless and annoying interludes in which the women dance. I\nblame the director for the bad details\n- the ladder at the side of the stage that\ngoes precisely nowhere when one of\nthe women scampers up it, the sounding of the ships\u2019 horns as they leave\nport all of three seconds after a woman\nhas been led out to be taken on board.\nWhen Andromache tells Hecuba her\ndaughter Polyxena has been killed, she\nbrings Polyxena\u2019s shoes in plastic bag\nfrom Costcutter. It\u2019s meant, I imagine,\nto be tragic. It just looks stupid. And\nworse, it\u2019s funny.\nA few simple moments of humanity seem to have slipped through the\nnet. Michael Gould, who plays Talthybius, the Greek guard who tells\nAndromache that if she gives up her\nchild willingly she might be allowed to\nbury him, manages against the odds to\nspeak awful words with kindness. For\nan instant the play is moving, and that\ninstant only serves to throw the rest of\nit into relief.\nWhen the curtain came down, I was\nsurprised to hear some of the audience\naround me whoop. Perhaps they were\ncheering because it was over. Otherwise, I will have to assume they were\non better drugs than I was.\nWomen of Troy runs until 27th February 2008.\nDidn\u2019t they teach you anything at Drama school: gorgeous dresses don\u2019t make good theatre!\n\n"

But in terms of sheer pub-licity, there is always something that\nbrings his films to the fore. Whether\nit be the purely enchanting cinematography of Crouching Tiger, Hidden\nDragon or Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath\nLedger sharing more than just a tent in\nBrokeback Mountain, there\u2019s always a\ngood press hook he can tap into. Here,\nit\u2019s just some graphic sex.\nPerhaps the anticipation of Lust,\nCaution was just too great. It won the\nGolden Lion at Venice last year ahead\nof Atonement, The Assassination of\nJesse James and I\u2019m Not There, but has\nfailed to maintain the momentum that\nBrokeback did after winning the same\nprize two years previously. The festival took place in late August and early\nSeptember, meaning that four months\ndown the line, the sparks had started\nto die.\nLust is not a bad film; it simply fails to\nmaximise on its potential. Its common\ndescription as a Hitchcockian thriller,\nthe death knell of many films, is ironic\nAng Lee\u2019s tale of Chinese resistance fighters peaks long before its climax\nin that it is low on the one thing that\nmade Hitchcock so popular - suspense.\nThe story of a group of young Chinese\nresistance fighters targeting a traitor during the early years of the Japanese occupation certainly gets off to a\npromising start. An interesting bunch\nof characters, they seem to each have a\nstory to follow, yet this is ejected in exchange for the main story, the wooing\nof said target by Wong Chia Chi (Wei\nTang).\nCould this be the most heavily publicised arthouse film ever? Sweeping\nstatements aside, Todd Haynes\u2019 Bob\nDylan-inspired movie I\u2019m Not There\nhas gathered astonishing publicity given its limited release. Why? Because\nCate Blanchett plays the man himself.\nAnd so does Christian Bale. And Heath\nLedger. And a few others.\nThe casting puts six actors into the\nshoes of Dylan at different stages of his\nlife, each with a different name, and in-tercuts them throughout the film in a\nmultilayered tapestry of 60s rebellion,\ndisillusionment and artistic expression.\nWith each sector having a completely\ndistinct feel, Haynes is emphatic in his\nappraisal of all the different sides of the\nlegend, but one of them can\u2019t help but\nseize the centre stage.\nCate Blanchett is the reason for the\nexcessive hype about the film. As one\nof the best actresses working today,\nBlanchett wins plaudits wherever she\ngoes and I can imagine it was a great\ncoup for her to be offered the role of\n\u201cJude Quinn\u201d (i.e. Dylan in a drug-infused swinging London). It certainly\nseems to be a great achievement for\nHaynes who expands her part greatly\nwhile a few of the others are reduced -significantly and regrettably. Blanchett\nis convincing and nuanced but the\nstunt casting detracts from the material at hand.\nThe awards buzz for I\u2019m Not There\nseems to focus entirely on her per-formance, an unfortunate occurrence\nas the film itself is far more interesting than the derivative trite that has\nperpetuated most shortlists so far. It\nis undoubtedly arthouse, with cinematography deeply influenced by the likes\nof Italian master Federico Fellini, but\nthe sheer beauty of the picture doesn\u2019t\ndetract from the artistic debate that infused both the picture and Dylan\u2019s life.\nTo make a film in the most simplistic\nsense of this most complex man would\nhave been a disservice to his genius.\nHaynes has created an ode in I\u2019m Not\nThere, not always complementary (as\nwould be expected from his glam rock\ntale Velvet Goldmine), but with great\nreverence for an artist who was always\nfaithful to himself. Whether you are a\nfan of Dylan or not, the vivacity of the\nsixties\u2019 society portrayed here is a sad\nreminder of the apathy that has infused\nthe new millennium. Long live Bob.\nAlex Casey\nY\nou can see them on the\nstarting line now: The\nCoen brothers jostling\neach other in the mid-dle; Julie Christie on the\ninside track; Keira Knightley pouting\nwhile perched side-saddle; and Daniel\nDay Lewis over the final fence before\nthe starting whistle\u2019s even been blown.\nAlas, if only the awards season was\nover as quickly as the Grand National.\nThis year it seems that, once again,\na race that was initially as wide open\nas Britney Spears\u2019 legs on exiting a taxi\nhas started to narrow, reducing the fun\nfor all concerned. Julie Christie will no\ndoubt fill the shoes of Helen Mirren\u2019s\nsweep last year for little seen Alzheimer\u2019s flick Away From Her (although\nChristie is less likely to do so in what\nMirren referred to as her \u2018stripper\nshoes\u2019 to appear taller) while Daniel\nDay-Lewis has earned rave reviews and\ngood odds for There Will Be Blood.\nSure, this isn\u2019t exactly going to be a\nTitanic-esque open book as far as Best\nPicture or Director go, but gone are the\ndays when Halle Berry had to fight real\ncompetition from Sissy Spacek, Judi\nDench and Nicole Kidman to clutch\nthe coveted Oscar statuette. Now it\nonly works if you have every other major award behind it in the cabinet.\nThe supporting categories seem to be\nwhere the real competition lies these\ndays (unless you were Rachel Weisz or\nJennifer Hudson). The rumour of Eddie Murphy storming out of the Kodak Theatre last year after Alan Arkin\nwas named Best Supporting Actor by\nthe Academy for Little Miss Sunshine\nbrought a particularly large smile to my\nface at a time when Leicester Square\nwas being overshadowed by gigantic\nNorbit posters with Murphy in his fat\nsuit. This year we\u2019d set our money on\nCasey Affleck (Jesse James) and Cate\nBlanchett (I\u2019m Not There, see right) to\ndo well here, although both are liable\nfor upset.\nThe award for Best Foreign Film\nis more difficult as each ceremony\nhas different rules for entry. For the\nGlobes, it just has to be non-English\nlanguage; for the Oscars, it has stupid\nrestrictions about international collaborations that often squeeze out worthy\nentrants. Cannes supremo 4 Months, 3\nWeeks, 2 Days is an early frontrunner\nalthough the Palme D\u2019Or isn\u2019t always a\nselling point for the Academy who feel\nCannes has a habit of mocking the stu-dios. You think? The Diving Bell and\nthe Butterfly could overtake on the final stretch here.\nAs for the Best Picture race, it\u2019s pretty open. The Globes have increased\nDrama nominations from five to seven\nstrangely, but No Country For Old Men\nwould be my (unseen) bet. Squeeze out\nsecond rate rubbish like Atonement,\nMichael Clayton and American Gangster and the Coens could even get Best\nDirector. It could however, just be another decline in form for the brothers,\nleaving it open to wide speculation.\nWhatever happens, it seems that the\nbiggest question is whether there will\neven be any ceremonies with the WGA\nstrikes. The Golden Globes are gone.\nAre the Oscars next?\nAlex Casey\nFilm Editor\nFor all the controversy it has caused\n(Lee has refused to cut it to gain a\nlower certificate in the US), the sex in\nLust, Caution is used to far greater effect than most films where disrobing\nis said to be purely for \u201cartistic purposes\u201d but is really just a way to get in\nsome teenage boys. The contrasting\nsex scenes throughout (of which there\naren\u2019t THAT many) lend real emotional power to the relationships in the film\nand possibly the most original piece of\nfilmmaking, at least for a mainstream\nfilm, that Lee has brought to the fore\nhere.\nThe rest, however, doesn\u2019t quite have\nthe same intensity. For a filmmaker\nrenowned for his ability portray raw\nemotion, the black and white characters here only rarely give in to grey.\nThis is more of a visual feast than a\nphilosophical or intellectual one, but a\ntreat that grows old long before it ends.\nSounds a lot like lust.\nLust, Caution \u2605\u2605\u2605\u272b\u272b\nDirector: Ang Lee\nWriter: James Schamus\nCast: Tony Leung Chiu Wai\nWei Tang\nJoan Chen\nAlex Casey\nI\u2019m Not There \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u272b\nDirector: Todd Haynes\nWriter: Todd Haynes,\nOren Moverman\nCast: Cate Blanchett,\nChristian Bale,\nHeath Ledger\nYou heard the man/lady, do it...\n\n"

It\nis likely that if this given\nperson swears, they will\nqualify their shit in the\nwrong way. Let me demonstrate this with a conversation taken\nfrom real life:\nX: Russell Brand is a pile of shit.\nY: You have every right so to opine. His\non-screen antics are unsavoury and\nbewildering.\nX: No. You don\u2019t understand. He\u2019s a\nhuge pile of shit.\nY: I have internalised what you said\nand am reflecting on its import.\nX: Listen to me. I\u2019m not just mouthing\noff here. You must understand that he\u2019s\na mountain of shit so big that he obscures the sun.\nY: I find the train of this conversation\nrepetitive and fruitless.\nPerson X in this situation is trying to\namplify the vehemence of his conviction but Person Y quite rightly recognises that Russell Brand, however shit,\nis of fixed dimensions and so ludicrous\nassertions regarding his size do not\nhave any reflection on his artistic mer-it. A teaspoonful of shit, reasons Person Y, is just as unappealing as a pile.\nInstead, Person X might have tried\nsomething more like: \u2018Russell Brand is\na fucking pile of fucking shit.\u2019 Exactly\nwhat this is supposed to mean is still\nunclear, however. One can envisage a\nsubstance called \u2018fucking shit\u2019 which is\nshit whose main raison d\u2019\u00eatre is to fuck\n(or be fucked); then one could custom-buildapileofittouseforfuckingthings\n(or to be fucked by things). Clearly, this\nwould be worse than an ordinary pile\nof shit, but exactly how much worse is\nleft to the sensibilities of the other par-ty, who may, for instance, find \u2018pissing\nshit\u2019 much more unsettling. Matters\nbecome more unsatisfactory when one\nnotices the distinct lack of opportunities to insert the word \u2018fucking\u2019 into\nthe sentence \u2018Russell Brand is a pile of\nshit.\u2019; one has thus a very limited ability to adjust ones vehemence according\nto how deeply one feels the sentiment.\nOne can\u2019t, for instance, say \u2018Russell\nBrand is a fucking pile of fucking, fucking shit.\u2019 since the last \u2018fucking\u2019 is tau-tologous \u2013 we have already established\nthe nature of the shit with which we are\ndealing. One might attempt something\nlike \u2018Russell Brand is a bum-titting\nfreak pile of fucking cock-arse rabbit\nshit.\u2019 and so forth, but one needs to\ntreat accuracy of expression as one\u2019s\nguiding principle. The following is far\nmore satisfying:\nX: Russell Brand is a pile of shit.\nY: You have every right so to opine. His\non-screen antics are unsavoury and\nbewildering.\nX: I don\u2019t think you understand the\nvigour of the belief I invest in my\nstatement.\nY: Then you must explain it to me in\ndepth.\nX: Let us take an absolute scale which\nruns from 0 to 100 whose units shall be\nknown as Pricks.

    "content": "6 felix Friday 11 January 2008\nComment, Opinion\n& Letters\nAnother theory\nObadah Ghannam\nY\nour last edition of the Felix\nfeatured a 3-page dedication to the opinions of Pietro Aronica regarding the\nAB-Soc event with Harun\nYahya. Putting to one side Babuna\u2019s\nability to give a decent speech, I felt\ndisappointed that Felix failed to publish\nthe brighter elements of the talk itself.\nThis would have made Aronica\u2019s opinions easier to understand; and, surely,\nthis neutral standpoint would have\nbeen the best one for Felix to take?\nHowever, this is not the reason why\nI write today. After I read Aronica\u2019s\nviewpoint, I wanted to highlight a few\npoints regarding the understanding\nhe puts forward. \u2018Creationism\u2019 has become a stigmatised word, enshrouded\nin thoughts of superstition and unscientific conclusions. Let me put for-ward, plainly and simply, the thoughts\nthat have led me to accept the idea of\ncreationism. I believe in the existence\nof a \u2018designer\u2019, someone above and\nbeyond the realms of matter, whose\nexistence is bound not by the laws of\ntime or physics, nor even by the laws\nof the universe. The \u2018designer\u2019 cannot be given the image of man, nor\nany other conceptualised image that\nmay come to mind \u2013 giving him an\neye like ours for example, must mean\nthat he needs to blink, and is therefore dependant on blinking to be able\nto see properly. I therefore don\u2019t know\nwhat form this \u2018designer\u2019 takes, but I\nknow that he must be out there. Why\ndo I know he exists? Firstly, we must\nquestion the origins of this universe.\nOriginally, scientists believed in the\nSteady State Theory, suggesting the\nuniverse has always existed. This was\nall right, until Edward Hubble came up\nwith his Big Bang theory. He observed\nthings like red shift, and cosmic radiation that suggested an explosion as the\npossible start of our universe. Current\nscience still stands by this. This is im-portant. Why? Well, logically speaking,\nan expansion must mean that the universe was smaller yesterday, and even\nsmaller the day before. Take this back\nmany years, just before the \u2018Big Bang\u2019,\nand you would find a point of zero vol-ume, when there was simply a state of\nnothingness. What does this mean?\nWell, simply, it raises the question of\nhow something, comes from nothing.\nMany theories have emerged. I looked\ninto these \u2013 the Oscillating Universe\nModel being one \u2013 and found some\nscientific and logical inconsistencies\nwith the ideas. I then came across this\nidea of a designer, defined in the way\nI described above, and I found that on\nmany spheres it made sense. He wasn\u2019t\ncreated, because he does not have\na beginning (a law of this universe),\nand could, therefore, easily have been\nbehind the transition from nothingness to something. There may not be\na scientific means to find out how. But\nthere may never be a scientific way to\nmeasure what happened during this\nstate of nothingness. And my belief in\nthis \u2018designer\u2019 is congruent with my observations of \u2018design\u2019 in this universe.\nSo \u2013 after all this \u2013 all I want to say\nis: explore before you deplore. Don\u2019t\nbrush these ideas away before fully understanding them. Things are deeper\nthan a speech and a supposedly poor\npresentation may indicate.\nScience and theology\nI\nhave not been a reader of the\nFelix since my early undergrad\ndays, but a copy of the Felix I\npicked up last term shocked and\nsaddened me. Now, don\u2019t get\nme wrong, I have heard that the Felix\nof today is one of the best student papers around, which is why I was quite\ndisappointed to read Pietro Aronica\u2019s\ntreatise on the Ahlul-Bayt Society\u2019s\ncontroversial event on \u2018evolutionism\u2019.\nI am in a position that perhaps many\nothers share, which is one of shame.\nAlthough the event was born of good\nintentions to promote dialogue, I\nfound myself quite embarrassed on\none hand by the way in which some of\nthe contentious arguments were put\nacross, but, on the other, I was equally\nashamed of the way it was responded\nto by the emotionally-charged A-level\nbiology graduates, which led to the\nlikes of last edition\u2019s article (you know,\nthe one with Darwin\u2019s picture next to\nHitler\u2019s. Tsk tsk).\nI have come to realise that this stems\nfrom a deeper problem which has appeared amongst the general public,\nwhich I think, threatens to pull us back\nto the wrong side of the Renaissance.\nThe western world was lured out of\nits dark ages by a movement in which\nlearning and thought were injected\ninto society, but there now exist people who abuse this beautiful ancient\nlogic to push their beliefs on to oth-ers, under the banner of \u2018science\u2019. This\nis a plea to all those who hold science\ndear to not jump on the bandwagon of\nmixing science with their theological\nbeliefs. Whether you believe the universe was created from nothingness/\ntimelessness, whether you believe aliens came down from planet X to give\nus their DNA, or whether you believe\nthere is no \u2018God\u2019 at all, please do not allow these beliefs to restrict your mind.\nOf course I respect people\u2019s beliefs,\nwhatever they are, but I hope we can\nall agree that science has nothing to\ndo with theology. Science is about this\nuniverse we live in, it is about what we\ncan measure, observe or at least infer;\nmost of all, it is about results. Science\ndoes not claim to deal with the existence or non-existence of a creator;\nscience pertains to this four dimensional box we are all in. Please do not\nbe fooled into following popularisers\n(read hijackers) of science, no matter\nhow eloquent their words. After all, we\nare at Imperial; so we should promote\nresponsible science, and not some sort\nof religious-\u2018scientism\u2019 alternative.\nComing back to the point, there was\nan understandable backlash at the evolutionism event, because many atheists\u2019 beliefs were challenged, and different people respond to this in different\nways. As I mentioned earlier, I do not\nagree with some of the material used\nto attack atheism, because atheism,\nlike theism, cannot be challenged using science. However, I must voice my\nprotest at Mr Aronica doing the exact\nsame thing, only in a ruder way. An\nhour or so after I read the offensive ar-ticle, I was invited to a Christmas carol\nconcert by a cheerful, smiling Mormon\nin the street. Now although I do not\nagree with the Mormons\u2019 theology, the\ngood manners with which he conducted himself made me think well of Mormonism (if that\u2019s what you call it); now\nimagine what someone would think\nof science after reading an article in\nwhich someone uses it to defend their\nbeliefs by speaking vulgarly of others\u2019. As much as it pains me to admit\nit, there are self-righteous \u2018scientists\u2019\namong us who are more indoctrinated\nthan those whom they seek to humili-ate. Of course, I do not mean to put\ndown the discussion of theology, but\nrather I want to stimulate responsible\ndiscussions in the correct arenas, and\nI look forward to ICU Islamic Society\u2019s\nannual Islam Awareness Week in week\n6 of this term, to clear up some mis-conceptions. It is only if we prevent\nour personal beliefs (atheistic or theis-tic) from affecting our science, that we\ncan remove these mental handbrakes\nthat restrict our learning, and bring\nback the pace of human thought to\nmatch that of eras past.\nSalman Butt\ninterfaith@imperial\n5pm\nthurs\n17th Jan\nin the Chaplaincy Centre\nfor anyone interested in\npromoting dialogue\nbetween faiths.\nmore details on website\nopen meeting\nDarwinism lecture controversy\nReaders take umbrage at Pietro Aronica\u2019s article on Ahlul Bayt Society\u2019s Darwinism lecture in issue 1390\nDeputy Editor, Andrew Somerville,\nwho attended the Creationism lecture responds:\nFelix apologises that the article cited\nabove was not clearly marked as being\npart of the comment section, as it was\nintended. In publishing said article,\nhowever, we did so in a fairly well balanced fashion, with not one, but three\nseparate articles covering the lecture.\nThe first was a purely factual summary\nappearing in the News section, with\ntwo contrasting views in the Comment\nsection, the second of which the Messrs\nGhannam and Butt appear to have\nmissed, giving two different views of the\nsame lecture. Mr. Aronica\u2019s piece was\nthe larger, but the quantity of the submission is left up to the contributor, and\nin no way reflects the views of Felix, nor\nthe weight that we give to the opinions\nof others.\nHowever, I feel I must address some\nof the points raised by the above writers\nwith my own opinion-riddled response.\nI believe that the above articles misrepresent members of the audience, labelling those who were less than enthused\nby the speaker as \u201cAtheists.\n\u201d In an event\nsuch as this, provocation is rife, and it\nwas certainly not the audience that cast\nthe first theo-scient-ism stone. Many\npeople in the audience that evening, of\nall types of spirituality, were offended\nby the speaker\u2019s attitude towards sci-ence, and towards the subject in gener-al. The placement of Hitler\u2019s image next\nto Dawkins\u2019 was not our own: the presentation itself accused Darwin of being\nresponsible for Hitler, Stalin, Fascism,\nAnarchism and Terrorism. To be angry\nwith such emotive links being drawn\ninto a \u201cscienctific\u201d debate in such dubious fashion is understandable.\nFelix represents many views, and\non such controversial subjects we can\nnever please all people, but we strive to\nbring balance to all subjects, as Azfarul\nIslam\u2019s wonderfully eloquent piece in\nthe issue concerned shows.\nWe\u2019ve had enough of the religious\ncontroversy now, though. Please stop\nsending us angry theological letters.\nLet us know your views: comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLetters may be edited for length and grammar purposes\nViews on these pages are not representative of Felix\n\n"

    "content": "Oh, is that the new Ratchet? You just can\u2019t help but feel this tiny yet cruel\ntwinge of disappointment as you look at Insomniac\u2019s latest for the first time.\nIt still looks like the same, old Ratchet. However, worry ye not Ratchet aficionados because this game is the same, old Ratchet.\nExcept if Ratchet and Clank: ToD were the title of the newest Pixar film. It\u2019s\nprobably going to cut into hyperbole territory but this must be said: Ratchet\u2019s\nPS3 outing is simply gorgeous and up there with the best of 3D animated films.\nIt\u2019s sumptuously detailed, velvet smooth and the art style still has that warm\ncartoony appeal that\u2019ll melt your heart. It\u2019s also a special effects tour de force\nwith all manner of sparkling lights, shiny surfaces, glorious explosions and an\noverabundance of destruction courtesy of Ratchet\u2019s arsenal. The new enemies, headed by\nthe Napoleon-esque Emperor Tachyon end up being a bunch of hapless little aliens (much\nlike their glorious leader) strapped up into fish-bowls atop giant metallic armoured suits.\nUpon bashing their exoskeletons can you choose to laugh/pity at their insignificant coun-tenance. Voiced to perfection yet again, this is a story that will amuse you to no end.\nThe classic Ratchet humour is back and permeates into all levels of this rollicking adventure full of melee bashing and truly marvellous weapons. The best of the lot are the\nGroovitron (below) and the Transmorpher. The former makes enemies stop in their\ntracks and bust out a variety of moves to groovy disco beats whereas the latter just\nzaps them into cute penguins replete with winter clothing. Best part? Get them\ndancin\u2019 and then turn them into penguins. Dancing penguins: Priceless.\nInnovation be damned, relentless fun is what it\u2019s all about!\nA downed airplane. A mysterious island abound with lush greenery, trech-erous ruins and sinister denizens. And a cocky treasure hunter who\u2019s never\nfar away from any sort of trouble.\nThese ingredients make for some great pulp action material and that\u2019s exactly what developers Naughty Dog have concocted. Uncharted follows the\ntale of Nathan Drake who believes himself to be the heir of the purportedly\nchildless Sir Francis Drake. He sets out seeking his ancient treasure and lands\nface-first into a rollicking adventure full of mystery, intrigue and danger.\nSeguing together the best of exploration, platforming and shooting mechanics from established titles, Uncharted creates a truly addicting amalgam\nof intense action and daring escapades. It feels familiar in a sort of warm, fuzzy\nway all the while possessing a strong sense of identity. While the somewhat generic enemies are more defined by the weapons they carry, they\u2019re still formidable opponents in\nnumbers and you\u2019ll have to duck, weave and roll your way through their hails of bullets\nto survive. The cover-based shooting mechanism, culled and steamlined from Gears\nof War, creates a palpitating sense of contention. Squeezing in headshots with a pistol\nhas rarely felt this rewarding. The only strange aspect is that enemies require a fixed\namount of body shots to down them regardless of where you\u2019re shooting them.\nThe adventuring aspects are equally engaging with the quiet sounds of nature immersing you as you concentrate in making death-defying leaps of faith.\nAll this is presented with radiant visuals and stellar animation. The sound-scape is equally mercurial, offering a range of melodies that serve to further\nengross. Besides the eye candy, there are startingly human characters that\ndraw you into the narrative and offer a tangible conviction to embark on this\nepic adventure.\n26 felix Friday 11 January 2008\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGames\nAs some of you will know the first three Call of\nDuty games have been set in WWII and have really been about fighting in those historical battles but Infinity Ward has decided to take it out\nof WWII and put it into the present. The story\nis completely fictional but still fairly plausible.\nIt also makes a very nice change from almost\nevery military shooter out there by having a\nmuch darker plot in that even though you go\nfight and do what you can to save it, the world\nstill kind of sucks at the end of it all. This message is pretty much summed up in one of the\nlevels in which you can\u2019t really do anything other\nthan look around at absolute destruction around you. It\u2019s really bit jarring.\nYou play the single player game mostly as two people: a US marine and an SAS operative and you visit a variety of locations from a cargo ship at sea to the abandoned city of\nChernobyl. The campaign is very sort of straight-forward in that you\u2019re always going to\nknow what you\u2019re doing and where you\u2019re supposed to be heading - helped\non your way by your compass which always points you the right way.\nIt usually isn\u2019t quite as simple as running from point A\nto point B though and there\u2019s quite a lot of variety from\nhouse to house - for example, in the Middle East you are\nkilling hordes of enemy troops, sneaking by enemy patrols\nin Russia and in the last level which is completely unrelated\nto the story in every way possible, you are slaughtering an\nentire airplane full of terrorists (I actually got asked why I\ndon\u2019t throw a grenade by someone; last time I checked,\nthrowing a frag grenade when you\u2019re 10 km in the air isn\u2019t\nthe smartest of ideas but neither is gunfire so whatever). All\nof this makes for some really intense gameplay which brings\nme to pretty much the only complaint about it and that the\nsingle player is just incredibly short and you\u2019ll probably finish the game in about 5 to 6 hours. You can up the difficulty\nif you really feel like a challenge but at the highest difficulty\nsetting your enemies are insanely deadly which can get\nincredibly annoying and somewhat less fun.\nHowever, the game more than makes up for it by having some excellent multiplayer. Most of the maps are taken\nfrom the single player campaign and just kind of changed\nup a bit to actually turn into multiplayer maps, I know that actually sounds\nhorrible but out of all of the 16 maps\nonly one or two of them are actually\nbad maps (I dislike a couple more than\nthat but only that many are actually\njust bad). And the maps pretty much\nrun the gauntlet of having wide open\nspaces where a good sniper just laughs\nat the unsuspecting victims down to really tight maps where grenades, shotguns and people just randomly firing\nhoping they\u2019ll hit something all over the\nplace. There are six modes of play free-for- all\nand team deathmatch both of are which your standard kill or be killed game type while\nthe others are more objective based either around capturing and holding control points\naround the map or planting a bomb to destroy an objective that your opponent have to\ndefend.\nThe multiplayer also rewards you for playing smartly, if you can get a three kill streak you\nget to call down a UAV which makes your opponents show up on your radar. If you can get\nup to five you can call in an airstrike which you can drop anywhere on the map and watch jets\nfly in and just kill anything in the area and if you manage to get up to seven you can call in a\nhelicopter which on some maps can be devastating (on some it might as well do nothing). Also\neverything useful that you do in the multiplayer you get experience and all those go towards your\nrank and when you gain ranks you get access to more equipment and classes. The class system\nis fairly interesting in that they all have strengths and weaknesses with their different load outs and\neventually you\u2019ll unlock the ability to create your own class which allows you to pick your own weap-ons, attachments, grenades and perks. Perks are split into three groups the first of which is mostly\nexplosives and the other two are slightly more random, you have perks that gives your more health or\ndamage and then you have cool things like martyrdom which every time you\u2019re killed you drop a live\ngrenade at your feet for all those annoying people that find teabagging fun.\nThe presentation of the game is really good, the textures are detailed, there\u2019s great use of lighting\nand bloom effects and if there\u2019s really any complaint its\nthat you\u2019ll find some of the models aren\u2019t all that good\nbut only if you\u2019re really looking for it. The game also\nhas some great music in it and has some really excellent sound effects for the weapons which when you\nfire them they sound like stuff that really is going to\nkill people which is awesome.\nEven though single player is incredibly short it\u2019s\nstill loads of fun to play and the game more than\nmakes up for it by having some great multiplayer\naction, making this a game definitely worth picking up.\nUNCHARTED: DRAKE\u2019S FORTUNE\nRATCHET & CLANK: TOOLS OF DESTRUCTION\nTrying to stay alive despite coming down with a fever on a Saturday night\nCALL OF DUTY 4: MODERN WARFARE\n\n"

Working to improve the situation and representation of black people in the UK,\nthe team\u2019s fragile harmony is shattered\nby the arrival of a new intern.\nManaging to avoid being either self-righteous or polemical, this play is an\ninteresting exploration of how a community deals with perceived victimi-sation. Whatever your own personal\nviews, the tightly written script is sure\nto provoke debate. Yet in seeking to\npack in so many big ideas, the characters inevitably become ciphers for various political and social viewpoints and\nthe audience\u2019s involvement suffers as a\nresult.\nKwaku\u2019s King Lear-like mental disintegration does not quite achieve the\nemotional resonance it aims for, and we\nnever feel enough sympathy towards\nhim for this to be a truly great drama.\nNevertheless, the acting from Colin\nMcFarlane (Michael) and Chu Omambala (Idrissa) in particular is excellent,\nand the dialogue has plenty of wit and\nhumour. Kwame Kwei-Armah clearly\nhas lots to say - this lively and sparky\nproduction means that his future work\nwill be awaited with interest.\nStatement of Regret runs until February 6th 2008, Cotteslowe Theatre at\nthe National Theatre, Southbank.\nDon Warrington plays a convincing Kwaku Mackenzie Life\u2019s a hoot in the office of the Institute for Black Policy\nAudience taken on a trip to Troy\nEmily Steel perseveres despite the flu but is disappointed with what the Greeks have captured\nT\nhe National\u2019s production\nof Women of Troy got five\nstars in The Independent.\nTime Out made it \u2018Critic\u2019s\nChoice\u2019. I tell you this because the night I went to see it, I had\nflu and was dosed up to the eyeballs\non Lemsip Max, which means it\u2019s possible (although unlikely) that my judgement was impaired. I tell you this because I am about to call it pretentious\nrubbish.\nThe original play by Euripides is the\nshocking and powerful story of the\nwomen who are enslaved when the\nGreeks conquer Troy. It sees Hecuba, the queen of Troy, taken with her\ndaughters and her gentlewomen as\nspoils of war, to be shared out among\nthe Greek victors. Most horrifically,\nit features Andromache, Hecuba\u2019s\ndaughter-in-law and the wife of Hector,\nhanding over her baby son so that the\nGreeks can throw him from the battle-ments. If she resists, the child will be\ntaken by force, and the women will not\nbe allowed to bury him. She gives him\nup, and at the end of the play the baby\u2019s\nbody is brought to Hecuba so she may\ndress it for the grave.\nIt\u2019s fairly difficult to make a story like\nthat unmoving, but this production\nmanages it. Directed by Katie Mitchell,\nfrom a version of the play by Don Taylor, this Women of Troy is all gimmicks\nand no heart.\nThe play is set in a dockside ware-house. You hear the noise of seagulls,\nand a big metal door leads out to the\nships. The warehouse is stark, dismal\nand cold. The women imprisoned\nthere wear elegant evening dresses.\nThey swish, they sparkle. They are very\nclearly out of place, snatched from the\nworld they know and thrown into this\none. It\u2019s a point that\u2019s made as soon as\nthe curtain is raised, and the remaining\neighty minutes add very little to it.\nThe characterisations of the women\nare jarring. They twitch and galumph\nabout the stage. They give no sense\nthat they are noblewomen, in their\ndeportment or in their speech. Even\nHecuba, played by Kate Duchene, only\nconveys her authority by booming and\nraving, and as such is unconvincing as\na queen whose throne has lately been\nstolen from her. A queen doesn\u2019t need\nto boom and rave.\nThese women fail to go on any kind\nof emotional journey. They start out at\na high pitch of hysteria and they stay\nthere. At one point, Hecuba declares\n\u201cThere is no agony we don\u2019t already\nfeel, no abyss of pain to discover.\u201d And\nthis is the problem. Lack of discovery\nmakes for dull storytelling. We ought\nto see them plumbing new depths,\nparticularly Hecuba, finally presented\nwith her dead grandson. But we do not.\nWhich isn\u2019t just inhuman; it\u2019s boring.\nI don\u2019t blame the actors. I blame the\ndirector. I blame the director for having them speak the text without feel-ing. I blame the director for choosing\nstyle over substance, for repeatedly\ninserting useless and annoying interludes in which the women dance. I\nblame the director for the bad details\n- the ladder at the side of the stage that\ngoes precisely nowhere when one of\nthe women scampers up it, the sounding of the ships\u2019 horns as they leave\nport all of three seconds after a woman\nhas been led out to be taken on board.\nWhen Andromache tells Hecuba her\ndaughter Polyxena has been killed, she\nbrings Polyxena\u2019s shoes in plastic bag\nfrom Costcutter. It\u2019s meant, I imagine,\nto be tragic. It just looks stupid. And\nworse, it\u2019s funny.\nA few simple moments of humanity seem to have slipped through the\nnet. Michael Gould, who plays Talthybius, the Greek guard who tells\nAndromache that if she gives up her\nchild willingly she might be allowed to\nbury him, manages against the odds to\nspeak awful words with kindness. For\nan instant the play is moving, and that\ninstant only serves to throw the rest of\nit into relief.\nWhen the curtain came down, I was\nsurprised to hear some of the audience\naround me whoop. Perhaps they were\ncheering because it was over. Otherwise, I will have to assume they were\non better drugs than I was.\nWomen of Troy runs until 27th February 2008.\nDidn\u2019t they teach you anything at Drama school: gorgeous dresses don\u2019t make good theatre!\n\n"

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n12 felix Friday 11 January 2008\nPolitics\nPolitics Editor \u2013 Omar Hashmi\nThe late former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto returned to the country only late last year\nBhutto dead \u2013 a conspiracy is born\nBenazir Bhutto, ex Prime Minister of\nPakistan, has been killed. Her death,\nperhaps the most significant death of\nthe 21st century so far, has thrown the\ncountry into turmoil and made the path\nto democracy extremely uncertain.\nGiven the tremendous significance of\nher death, one might suppose that the\nall the parties involved in Pakistan\u2019s political process would go to every length\nto avoid any uncertainty or ambiguity\naround her death. Unfortunately this\nhas not been the case.\nThere were conflicting accounts of\nher death from the start. A government\nspokesman said her head was slammed\nagainst her vehicle by the blast from a\nbomb \u2013 but her colleagues said she\ndied from bullet wounds. However\nPresident Musharraf said, \u201cOne should\nnot give a statement that\u2019s 100% final.\nThat\u2019s the flaw that we suffer from\u201d\nadding that fresh evidence had come to\nlight and also admitting that she might\nhave been shot. Despite this, the lack\nof a proper autopsy means that all the\ngovernment has is its word, and unfortunately for Musharraf\u2019s government,\nthis counts for little. The government\u2019s\noriginal line was seen as an attempt\nto rid itself of responsibility for her\nsecurity. Bruce Riedel, an expert on\nPakistan at the Brookings Institution\nin Washington said \u201cIf there is a gunshot wound, the security was abysmal\u201d.\nThe government did not want to be\nexposed on its careless approach to\nsecurity, he added. President Musharraf has responded to these concerns\nstating that there had been no lapse\nin security and that Ms Bhutto was\nresponsible for her death by standing\nup through the car\u2019s sun roof. This line\nhas provoked anger amongst Bhutto\u2019s\nsupporters. PPP (Bhutto\u2019s Party) Senator Babar Awan said. \u201cBenazir Bhutto\nwas martyred in a political conspiracy.\nThe entire government is now involved\nin a save-the-culprit campaign. As the\nIndependent put it \u201cThey [Pakistanis]\ndon\u2019t blame Al-Qaeda, they blame the\ngovernment\u201d.\nAthar Minallah, a board member\nof the hospital where Ms. Bhutto was\ntreated, said the doctors felt an autopsy\nwas needed to discover how she actually died. The official medical report\ndoes not specifically mention a bullet,\nthe actual cause of the head wound was\nto be left to an autopsy which did not\nmaterialise. Ms. Bhutto\u2019s husband Mr.\nZardari refused to allow an autopsy to\ntake place. \u201cIt was an insult to my wife,\nan insult to the sister of the nation, an\ninsult to the mother of the nation,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cI know their forensic reports are\nuseless. I refuse to give them her last\nremains.\u201d Doctors treating her had\nstressed that \u201cwithout an autopsy it is\nnot at all possible to determine as to\nwhat had caused the injury\u201d.\nAn inquiry has been launched into\nthe circumstances surrounding her\ndeath as well as the cause of her death.\nUK Prime Minister Gordon Brown\nis sending a team of detectives from\nLondon to aid in the inquiry. Pakistan\u2019s\nPresident Pervez Musharraf has said he\nis \u201cnot fully satisfied\u201d with the current\ninvestigation. Referring to the team of\ndetectives being sent by the UK, he\nsaid: \u201cWe needed more experience,\nmaybe more forensic and technical\nexperience that our people don\u2019t have\u201d.\nFor Musharraf\u2019s government, ending\nthe ambiguity about Bhutto\u2019s death is\nmore of a priority than for the PPP (her\nformer party) who are benefiting from\nthe anti-government sympathy resulting from the assassination. The FBI\nwas not asked to aid the investigations\ndue to the negative repercussions of direct U.S. involvement in Pakistan.\nIt does not seem likely that she was\nassassinated by Musharraf\u2019s govern-ment, the consequences of such an attack were easy to predict and the government certainly has not benefited\nfrom the turmoil and anger that has\nfollowed her death. Despite this, low-level collaboration by the intelligence\nservices is a possibility because of Islamist infiltration. Musharraf has publicly denied involvement, when asked if\nhe had played any part in the assassina-tion, the president said: \u201cMy family by\nany imagination is not a family which\nbelieves in killing people, assassinat-ing, intriguing.\u201d However he did admit\nThe ex-Prime Minister\u2019s precise cause of death becomes the centre of controversy after an autopsy is denied\nthat mistakes were made following\nher death and that evidence had been\nlost at the crime scene. \u201cI am sure that\nthey did not do it with an intention of\nhiding some secrets or that the intelligence agencies instructed them to\nhide secrets,\u201d Mr Musharraf told re-porters. \u201cIf you are meaning that it was\nby design to hide evidence, no, it was\ninefficiency.\u201d\nIslamic militants who have taken\nincreasing control of Pakistan\u2019s tribal\nareas along the Afghan border are\nthe likely perpetrators. Ms. Bhutto\nspoke out many times against Islamic\nmilitants and they have made no secret of their determination to kill Ms\nBhutto since her return to the country.\nShe had already survived an attack by\nmilitants; a double suicide attack on\nher motor cavalcade left 130 dead in\nOctober. The style of her killing, a suicide attack, points to Islamic militants\nwhile the result of her death coincide\nKadhim Shubber\nwith their interests, damaging stability\nin Pakistan.\nIslamists in Pakistan have proved\nhow dangerous they are and how clearly their beliefs run counter to those of\nthe Pakistani people. In assassinating\nBhutto, the Islamists have dashed the\nhopes of the Pakistani people by endangering Pakistan\u2019s progress towards\na stable democratic government.\nWhile the Pakistani people have rioted\nin anger since Bhutto\u2019s death (resulting\nin over 50 deaths), I sometimes wonder if this anger is disproportionately\ndirected towards Musharraf. These so\ncalled Islamists need to be removed as\na threat before Pakistan can move towards a democratic future. They label\nall those that try and bring development to Pakistan as enemies and are\nindiscriminate in their attacks. During\nthe Muslim holiday Eid, these \u2018Islamists\u2019 carried out a suicide bombing inside a mosque, during prayers, killing\n50. The real threat for Pakistani democracy comes not from Musharraf,\nbut these irrational killers who imagine\nthemselves as defenders of Islam.\nElections that were planned for the\n8th of January have been delayed until\nFebruary 18th. The reason cited by the\nelectoral commission was civil unrest\nin Pakistan. A more plausible reason is\nthat the ruling party fears that an election soon after Bhutto\u2019s assassination\nwould prove to be a foregone conclu-sion. PPP senator Babar Awan warned\nof dire consequences, \u201cIf elections are\ndelayed, the constitution is violated,\nthen this would amount (to an) opening of a floodgate of violence throughout the country,\u201d he said. Despite these\napocalyptic predictions, the country\nhas been relatively stable after the initial rioting. This is down in part to a\nmassive effort from the army and the\ngovernment to restore law and order\nin the country. Also the major political\nparties decided not to protest the delay.\n\u201cIncidents of violence have gone down,\nin that sense one can say the situation\nis better,\u201d said former government minister and political analyst Shafqat Mahmood. In some areas of Pakistan a delay was inevitable, There had been real\ndamage to Pakistan\u2019s electoral process\nduring the rioting. 10 election offices\nwere burned down. Due to the delay\nformer Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s\nparty PML-N has decided to stand for\nelection, making it a three-horse race.\nBy delaying the elections and allowing sentiments to settle, Pakistan has a\nmuch greater chance of holding meaningful elections that will help move the\ncountry forward.\nThe PPP is hoping for a large sympathy vote and are attempting to exploit\nthis by choosing her son Bilawal Bhutto\nZardari as the new leader of the party.\nCritics have denounced this as dynastic and undemocratic, but the Bhutto\nbrand remains strong and represents\nthe PPP\u2019s best hopes for the upcoming\nelections. However at only 19, Bilawal\nBhutto is too young to stand for election and until he finishes his studies\nat Oxford, his father Asif Ali Zardari\nwill become the de facto leader of the\nPPP. However many within the party\nare unhappy with his ascendancy due\nto his 11 years in prison on corruption\ncharges.\nThe death of Benazir Bhutto has\nraised the stakes and the tension in\nPakistan. Political stability must be\nachieved before a meaningful democracy can be established. An overwhelming victory for either the secular parties (the PPP and PML-N) or\nfor Musharraf\u2019s party (PML-Q) in the\nFebruary elections will fuel violence. A\nmore sober result favouring the democratic forces will be more conducive\nto progress by allaying fears of electoral rigging and reducing the likelihood of a military backlash. However\nI believe that 2008 is unlikely to be a\nyear of change for Pakistan; few will\nconcentrate their anger towards Islamists who will continue to attack indiscriminately and despite an inquiry into\nBhutto\u2019s death, the people of Pakistan\nwill blame Musharraf\u2019s government,\nletting the true enemies of the Pakistani people off the hook.\nMs Bhutto\u2019s son Bilawal Zardari is being called upon to lead the PPP\n\n"

The Middle-Eastern\natmosphere and lithe acrobatics of Prince of Persia, the swirling conspiracies about the correlation\nof genetics and information ala Metal Gear\nSolid and the proximal stealth tactics of Hitman all\ncome to mind whilst traversing the distinctly khaki-saturated environments.\nThe melange of such established mechanics and\natmospheric, indigenous art style do well to captivate the gamer for the overture. Al-ta\u2019ir is capable\nof some deft parkour and these portions often feel\nexhilirating. Similarly, the sense of tension as you\ntrack your quarries amongst a bustling, cognizant\ncrowd is quite palpable. The sword combat, despite being quite linear, offers visceral thrills in the\nform of brutality by the blade. There\u2019s a strongly\nevocative sense of actual detective work even if the situations tend to be mimetic after\nthe initial few. The visuals are astounding at their best with delicate nuances, solid animation and an admirable sense of architecture. Overall, it starts off rather brilliantly.\nDespite a riveting introduction, there are myriad cracks that show with time. Worryingly, an increasinging bit of ennui sets in early on. While it borrows some fantastic elements, Creed plays safe with them and refuses to go the extra distance. The\nstory will seem clever and thought-provoking, but a few brushes with literature and the\naforementioned Metal Gear Solid reveal it to be a bit plain and rather unexciting. There\nare certain graphical errors and despite excellent vocal localisation, Al-ta\u2019ir\u2019s strong\nAmerican accent is grating and breaks an otherwise spellbinding illusion.\nWhile flawed, the game manages to be highly entertaining. Plus, Assassins pwn.\nGuitar Hero III: Legends of Rock is the latest\nin the Guitar Hero series.\nThe game\u2019s had a graphics\nmakeover, the gameplay\u2019s been\ntightened (a bit) as well some new\nfeatures being added in the form of a\ngood co-op carrier mode and not so good\nguitar battles in which you compete with another\nguitarist (NPC or player) in a rock off.\nIt\u2019s a good idea but in practise it does not work\nwell. But don\u2019t let this put you off; Guitar Hero 3 it\nis probably the strongest Guitar Hero so far mostly\ndue to the tracklist which features over 70 master\ntracks from across the rock spectrum from the\nKaiser Chiefs\u2019 \u201cRuby\u201d to \u201cThrough the Fire and\nFlames\u201d by Dragonforce (and yes, it is very, very\ndifficult).\nThe game is the most difficult in the series so far,\nso it\u2019s probably not best start for you newbies out\nthere, but it is well worth a play and still remains one of the best party games out there.\n(I can only vouch for the Xbox 360 version) but with online play and new downloadable songs becoming available stands to keep the game fresh for a good few months\nyet.\nThere is even a rock version of \u201cWe Three Kings\u201d performed by Steve Ouimette for\nfree download.

Once\nthat\u2019s over with you\u2019re ready to\njump into the action.\nThe combat system is nothing\namazing. In fact, if you were to\nbase your opinion of the game\non it, it would be no where near\nas good of a game as it is. AI\nis weak on both the enemy and\nally sides. Your guys will shoot\nat walls or into your back 70%\nof the time, and you can back\nup and bottle neck 30 enemies\ninto a hallway to be slaughtered\nlike cattle. The shotgun is also\npossibly the most unbalanced,\nunstoppable weapon in gaming history. I was able to snipe\n100 yards with the shotgun, and\nwhen they got close the blast\nstrength knocked them on their\nbacks leaving them helpless for\na good five seconds.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t\nfun being a one man wrecking\ncrew. And by no means was it\nalways a breeze. There was one\npoint that I can\u2019t go into details\nabout without spoiling anything\nthat took me 45 minutes of dying to beat.\nMass Effect sports an awesome lineup of characters you\nwill fall in love with immedi-ately, ranging from the sassy\nand spunky Ashley Williams\nto the badass, \u201cI don\u2019t give a\ncrap\u201d Urdnot Wrex. With that\nin mind though, the way your\nsquad-mates are developed in\nthis game can often make them\nseem underwhelming compared with their previous\nsci-fi epic and spiritual\npredecessor, Knights of\nthe Old Republic.

After playing through about 25\nhours of the game I can\nsafely say, Mass Effect\nlives up to the BioWare\nname. This is nothing short\nof a revolutionary title, one that\nbrings together the disparate elements of role-playing game and\nshooter for a compelling, story-driv-en experience.\nOverall, the storyline is a great\none, bordering on brilliant.

    "content": "35\nfelix\nFriday 11 January 2008\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\nDrink (water) to your health!\nGil Saville\nEnergia Fitness Instructor\nSports league\nWater is crucial for us to remain\nhealthy and alive, but all too often it is\ntaken for granted as to why it is so important and to what extent it helps us\nperform better in exercise. Water is the\nsecond most important element to life\nnext to oxygen. The body can survive\nfor weeks without food but only days\nwith out water, and often for a lot less\nin warm temperatures and high alti-tudes. The body and all its organs are\ncomprised mainly of water making the\naverage person about 60-75% water.\nWater is essential to all bodily func-tions. It aids our digestive system with\nthe absorption of nutrients, it\u2019s involved in the regulation of body temperature and blood circulation, it helps\nin the transport of nutrients and oxygen to cells and removes waste products from the body. Alongside these\nfunctions water also helps to reduce\nwear on joints providing lubrication\nand cushioning, including the spinal\ncord. Without sufficient water supply\n(dehydration) we open up our bodies\nto all kinds of problems. Dehydration\ncan lead to hypertension, asthma, allergies and migraines.\nThe main function of water is its\nrole in regulating our temperature. We\ngenerate heat when we train and there\nare numerous mechanisms which the\nbody calls upon to lose heat. Obviously\nthe surrounding environment plays a\nrole, but a significant method of cooling is sweating. The evaporation of fluid from the skin is very effective. During prolonged exercise it is possible to\nlose as much as two litres of sweat per\nhour. This would be ideal in keeping us\ncool, but unfortunately not all sweat\nevaporates, as some drops off the skin\nand is wasted.\nFluid loss, even as little as 2% of body\nweight, can seriously impair the capacity to perform muscular work. In\ntemperate climates, most athletes lose\n1-5% of body weight in prolonged ex-ercise, even when taking regular fluid\nthroughout.\nWater transports oxygen, nutrients,\nhormones and antibodies through the\nblood stream and lymphatic system\n(used to fight cancer, viruses, bacteria and infections). This is obviously\nimportant to us as we push our bodies hard in the gym and by doing so\nwe greatly increase the amount of water that our body excretes. When we\nare dehydrated our immune system is\ntherefore open to invasion from outside entities and we are more susceptible to the attack. Therefore good hydration helps to protect us from this.\nBrain tissue is 85% water and it uses\na twentieth of the body\u2019s blood supply.\nWhen you are dehydrated you have\nless water in the blood and this lack of\nwater can reduce brain functions and\ncan cause fatigue, depression, stress\nand can also lead to migraines which\nmay be also be an indicator or poor\nbody temperature regulation.\nMuscle is 75% water, so it is important that a high water level is maintained in order to prevent muscular\ndehydration. When muscles become\ndehydrated they are open to possible\nloss of strength and cramps. Cramps\nare a muscle spasm where a muscle\ncontracts abnormally and locks into an\nawkward position. Although the direct\ncause of cramp remains unknown, it\nis known that muscles that are over-worked, injured or exposed to extreme\ntemperatures are more likely to succumb to cramp. Water helps to regulate our body temperature and aids in\nthe transport of nutrients to cells, so by\nincreasing water intake we can reduce\nthe risk of cramp.\nWater is a lubricant for the joints and\nthe cartilage between the vertebrae\nand at the end of long bones at synovial joints there is also a significant\namount of water. Cartilage needs to\nbe well hydrated as this prevents abrasive damage occurring when the opposing surfaces of the cartilage make\ncontact with each other. Long term\ninadequately hydrated joints can lead\nto friction damage resulting in joint\ndeterioration and pain.\nAnother reason why water is also\nimportant is due to the fact that when\nwe dehydrate, our body\u2019s solution loses\nviscosity, which in turn reduces the\nefficiency of the protein and enzyme\nfunctions of the body. So when we are\ntrying to increase our protein absorp-tion, water is a fundamental aspect\nas acids and enzymes in the stomach\nbreak food down into a more fluid\nstate as part of the digestion process.\nLack of fluid means you will not be\nable to break down the food easily and\nefficiently.\nWater is also essential to us as it is\nfundamental with regards to strength.\nBeing slightly dehydrated will reduce a\nmuscle\u2019s lifting capability, and training\nwhen in this state will reduce strength\ngains that you might normally get.\nIf you can\u2019t lift as much as when you\nare adequately hydrated, then how can\nyou expect to push harder and make\ngains?\nWater can also be one of your most\nuseful tools for weight loss. Water is\ncalorie free so when you are on a restricted diet, drinking water can help\nfill you up and alleviate some of the\nhunger.\nTeam P W D L F A Diff % FI\n1 IC Netball 1st 9 9 0 0 488 254 234 100.00 45\n2 IC Squash Men's 1st 9 9 0 0 45 0 45 100.00 45\n3 IC Tennis Men's 2nd 7 7 0 0 58 12 46 100.00 35\n4 IC Hockey Men's 1st 9 7 1 1 32 15 17 77.78 33\n5 IC Rugby Union Men's 1st 10 8 0 2 244 109 135 80.00 32\n6 IC Tennis Women's 1st 7 6 1 0 49 20 29 85.71 32\n7 IC Squash Men's 2nd 9 7 0 2 30 15 15 77.78 27\n8 IC Rugby Union Men's 2nd 9 5 2 2 220 138 82 55.56 21\n9 IC Volleyball Men's 1st 6 5 0 1 10 2 8 83.33 21\n10 IC Fencing Men's 2nd 4 4 0 0 525 433 92 100.00 20\n11 IC Football Men's 1st 8 3 4 1 14 6 8 37.50 19\n12 IC Fencing Women's 1st 7 5 0 2 899 735 164 71.43 17\n13 ICSM Hockey Women's 1st 9 5 1 3 54 20 34 55.56 15\n14 IC Football Women's 1st 6 3 2 1 7 4 3 50.00 15\n15 ICSM Football Men's 1st 6 3 2 1 11 7 4 50.00 15\n16 IC Volleyball Women's 1st 3 3 0 0 8 4 4 100.00 15\n17 ICSM Netball 2nd 6 4 0 2 161 132 29 66.67 12\n18 ICSM Badminton Women's 1st 2 2 0 0 11 5 6 100.00 10\n19 IC Badminton Men's 1st 9 5 0 4 41 31 10 55.56 9\n20 ICSM Hockey Men's 2nd 9 5 0 4 22 21 1 55.56 9\n21 IC Lacrosse Women's 1st 7 4 0 3 51 49 2 57.14 8\n22 IC Hockey Women's 1st 8 3 2 3 27 29 -2 37.50 7\n23 IC Hockey Men's 2nd 9 4 1 4 43 23 20 44.44 6\n24 IC Hockey Men's 3rd 9 4 1 4 17 17 0 44.44 6\n25 IC Basketball Men's 1st 3 2 0 1 207 176 31 66.67 6\n26 ICSM Netball 1st 7 3 1 3 243 256 -13 42.86 5\n27 IC Rugby Union Women's 1st 1 1 0 0 50 5 45 100.00 5\n28 ICSM Hockey Women's 2nd 9 3 2 4 28 40 -12 33.33 3\n29 IC Netball 2nd 6 3 0 3 168 155 13 50.00 3\n30 IC Table Tennis Men's 1st 6 3 0 3 63 39 24 50.00 3\n31 ICSM Rugby Union Men's 3rd 6 3 0 3 159 104 55 50.00 3\n32 IC Squash Men's 3rd 4 2 0 2 8 4 4 50.00 2\n33 IC Badminton Men's 2nd 8 3 1 4 30 34 -4 37.50 1\n34 IC Rugby Union Men's 3rd 9 4 0 5 165 147 18 44.44 0\n35 ICSM Hockey Men's 1st 9 3 1 5 20 35 -15 33.33 -3\n36 IC Table Tennis Women's 1st 3 1 0 2 4 11 -7 33.33 -3\n37 IC Squash Women's 1st 7 2 1 4 12 16 -4 28.57 -4\n38 ICSM Hockey Men's 3rd 3 0 1 2 4 9 -5 0.00 -6\n39 IC Hockey Women's 2nd 8 2 1 5 11 39 -28 25.00 -8\n40 IC Hockey Men's 4th 7 2 0 5 8 18 -10 28.57 -10\n41 ICSM Netball 3rd 7 2 0 5 132 178 -46 28.57 -10\n42 ICSM Rugby Union Men's 1st 7 2 0 5 121 182 -61 28.57 -10\n43 ICSM Football Men's 2nd 4 0 1 3 8 15 -7 0.00 -10\n44 IC Fencing Men's 1st 5 1 0 4 553 600 -47 20.00 -11\n45 ICSM Rugby Union Men's 2nd 10 3 0 7 152 273 -121 30.00 -13\n46 IC Badminton Women's 1st 7 1 1 5 19 37 -18 14.29 -13\n47 ICSM Hockey Women's 3rd 8 2 0 6 7 20 -13 25.00 -14\n48 ICSM Badminton Men's 1st 5 0 0 5 9 31 -22 0.00 -20\n49 IC Football Men's 3rd 9 1 1 7 11 31 -20 11.11 -21\n50 IC Tennis Men's 1st 9 1 1 7 26 64 -38 11.11 -21\n51 IC Football Men's 2nd 7 0 1 6 8 22 -14 0.00 -22\nThis term we welcome the Medics to\nthe Sports league.

    "content": "games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n29\nFriday 11 January 2008 felix\nGames\nCarving out its name in the hall of fame of the original Xbox\nand PS3, Ninja Gaiden and its later re-released Sigma edition\nredefined platform gaming with its fast-paced combat system\nand extensive combo list.\nWith such a history Ninja Gaiden II brings with it a certain\nPedigree amongst its fellow platforming peers. For those that\nhaven\u2019t been graced with playing the original, Ninja Gaiden\nII is an Xbox 360 exclusive platform game with a heavy emphasis on combat in a near-future setting with fantasy ele-ments, and so the game revolves around running between\nfights against a combination of fiends, samurai and sci-fi\ntroopers.\nThe defining characteristics that made the original what\nit was look set to remain intact in the sequel, including the\nchallenging level of play and the almost poetic nature of\ncombat.\nCurrently released trailers show locales based upon recognisable\nreal-world locations including the likes of Venice, New York and Japan. Current info regarding weapon selection shows the usual single sword, twin swords as well as more exotic weapons such as a\nset of claws (think Wolverine) and a scythe.\nThe developers have chosen to increase the age rating from a 15\nto 18, allowing them increase the depth in combat by dismembering\nopponents limbs while giving the fights a far more visceral feel.\nThe game is currently set to be released this spring, so humanity will have to look for its scythe-wielding Ninja fix elsewhere for\nthe time being.\nSplinter Cell has always been\nthe other stealth series, offering a slower, more deliberate\ntype of gameplay over Metal\nGear\u2019s more spontaneous,\nstylised sneaking.\nAfter toying around with a\nrather rigid formula for three\ntitles, UbiSoft has finally decided to try something a little\ndifferent - but not too much. Inspired by the intelligent crowd\nmentality established in Assassin\u2019s Creed, they have looked\ntowards the likes of the Bourne trilogy and The Fugitive to offer a more evanescent,\ncapricious version of stealth. This time, series stalwart Sam Fisher is in contention\nwith the very organisation that had raised him. With the Third Echelon a shadow of its\nformer self, Fisher only has his wits and his ingenuity to survive. In essence, Conviction\nis playing catch-up with MGS4\u2019s \u2018nowhere to hide\u2019 mantra.\nThe game is set in urban areas that are populated by a bevy of civilians, police officers and Government agents. It\u2019s upto Sam to complete his recon activities all the while\nremaining hidden within the crowd, flowing with them without disruption. When the\nsituation calls for action, however, he is able to utilise the environment around\nhim to his advantage. This ties in with a natural animation system designed for Sam to interact organically with his surroundings.\nThese are certainly moves in a rather interesting new direction\nthat is quite far from the light-and-shadows stealth mechanic of\nSplinter Cells yore. Gameplay videos, despite being work in\nprogress, reveal a title that is much akin to an Assassin\u2019s\nCreed set in the present day sans the parkour acrobat-ics. The graphics look rather impressive and\nSam Fisher is sporting a rather George\nClooney-esque beard that makes\nhim look a bit more human.\nRumours have it that development of the game has been\ntroubled and restarted two\ntimes already. One hopes\nthat these issues are\nsorted out for this rather\npromising title.\nComing from the creators of the original Legacy of Kain mythos and the eerie Eternal Darkness, Too Human promises a\nmelange of epic, high-fantasy storytelling and intense GunXSword combat popularised by the one and only Devil May Cry.\nIn a futuristic rendition of Norse Mythology, you find yourself in\nthe heavy metallic boots of Baldur - the god of all things green, figuratively not literally. The interesting aspect here is that Norse gods are not\nimmortals. Rather, they are warriors and personifications of utmost respect and\nprodigious ability; in this game, these beings further distance themselves from weaker\nhumans through the augmentation of cybernetic implants. So far the plot whispers of\nvestiges of great depth and moral pondering as it presents these evermore mechanistic gods and their enemies: a machine army that slaughters humans in order to\nincorporate flesh and blood into their being. The irony here being that the reason is for\nthe machines to become more akin with that they perceive as \u2018human\u2019, while the gods\nmove further towards embracing a metallic future.\nBaldur is an exception. Among all the gods, he alone possesses the least upgrades\nand this action is viewed with suspicion. Like the other legendary game about powerful deities, God of War, there seem to be a lot of internal politics and struggle within\nthe hierarchy. It\u2019s always an interesting concept and moreso in the light of humanising\nthese characters despite their attempts to convince otherwise.\nWhile the plot has me significantly intrigued, the gameplay revealed thus far doesn\u2019t\ninspire much confidence. It looks airy and rigid; easily outclassed by the impending\nrelease of it\u2019s combat forebear: Devil May Cry 4.\nStill there is much to hope from this title on an aesthetic level since the art is highly\nstylised and the sense of a futuristic atmosphere is impressively palpable.\nFable was an extraordinarily ambitious game and coming\nfrom the creator of the hallowed Black & White (and not-so-good sequel), such was to be expected. While the original wasn\u2019t\nable to meet Peter Molyneux\u2019s divinely lofty goals, Fable 2 takes its\nchance at reaching for the stars\nSet in the world of Albion yet again, Fable 2 allows you to truly embody your chosen character and live out a span of fifty years of his or her\nlife. This time, the emphasis on a truly pervasive, consequential experience\nseems to be the ultimate goal. Once you\u2019ve begun your journey, the choices laid in\nfront of you range from the mundane to the great.\nMorality in terms of good and evil was the lynchpin of character development in\nthe previous game. This time, such a balance is important but no longer the focus.\nRather, money happens to be the representation of morality; rather perspicacious, no?\nThe combination of your alignment with the forces of light and/or dark and\nyour financial status will now have bearing on how other\ncharacters treat you and how you will be able to conduct\nyourself in the game world.\nThe overarching plotline has something to do with an\nindividual called Lucien whose goal it is to build a fifty-storey tower - interestingly, this is in tandem with\nyour gameplay time of a similar number of years.\nBeyond this lies the seemingly infinite amount\nof choice offered, as Mr Molyneux waxes lyrical\nabout his game. One can get married, become\npregnant (or get someone else pregnant) and\nhave children. These characters remain and interact with you realistically. Similarly, you can even\nhave a pet who\u2019ll come running back to you\neven if you spurn it away. Aww. You can also\nundertake any profession ranging from a\nmere barmen to a more risque activity such\nas prostitution. Err...\nThe underlying combat principle is being based\non timing and context-sensivity via the use of\na single button. How this will work is yet to be\nseen, but there are worries that combat depth is\nbeing sacrificed for accessibility.\nRegardless, Fable 2 stands as an energetic,\nzealous project that has the potential of offering an multifarious experience of epic\nproportions. Or at the least, a highly en-tertaining, fun one.\nTOO HUMAN\nNINJA GAIDEN II SPLINTER CELL: CONVICTION\nFABLE 2\n\n"

    "content": "32 felix Friday 11 January 2008\nThe little guy that\u2019ll win your love\nThe teen-eeepc with a teeny price. James Finnerty finds out exactly what is on offer for your cash\nI\nreckon that not very many people reading this will have heard\nof this easy-to-overlook new\nproduct, which I feel should\nbe given a lot more attention,\nespecially within the student demo-graphic. To cut what could be a long\nstory short, the eeepc (pronounced as\na single e) is a new laptop from the established motherboard and notebook\nmanufacturer ASUS. Now i know what\nyou\u2019re thinking: whats so special about\nanother laptop? Its not a Mac so I'm\nnot going to buy it. Well I'll explain.\nThe big selling point of the eee is the\nfact that it is one of the smallest fully\nfunctional laptops ever produced; it's\nso portable I'm stuck as to whether to\nclass it as a laptop or a palmtop.\nBefore going any further I'll lay out\nall the facts and figures so you can get\na better idea of what this device has to\noffer. Its dimensions are 225mm wide \u00d7\n165mm deep \u00d7 35mm thick and its very\nlow mass pulls in at an anorexic 920g.\nSo it\u2019s not going to break your back like\nevery other 'portable' machine brought\nto you by the other big manufacturers.\nIts screen can be a bit limiting at 7\u201d,\nbut it pulls off a reasonable resolution,\nfor its size, of 800x480 pixels. It uses\na 900Mhz Intel celeron M processor\nwith its clock speed tamed down to\n630Mhz to save on battery and heat,\nbut there are some warranty-voiding\nways of getting it to run at full whack.\nAt the Celeron's disposal is 512mb of\nRAM and behind this is 4Gb of Solid\nState memory, fulfilling the role normally occupied by the faithful hard\ndisk. In place of your usual Vista/XP or\nOSX, you get supplied with a reasonably mainstream Linux variant called\nXandros. The eee also has a decent\nbattery life of 3-4 hours and is supplied\nwith a wall-wart style charger, as opposed to a normal laptop charger with\na huge brick midway down the cable.\nNow to get onto the eee's pros and\ncons. It's small; this is good and bad.\nThe keyboard, track pad and screen\ncan be hard to use at first, producing\ntyping errors and frustration at trying\nto click the correct icon, but this is the\ncost associated with having this level of\ncarry-around-all-day portability.\nA big consideration for many is the\nsmall storage capacity. After the operating system and applications you\u2019re\nleft with a mere 1.4Gb space that you\ncan use. This isn't a lot for your music and films but it\u2019s plenty for all the\ndocuments and other work you want\nto store on it.\nPeople may or may not be put off by\nLinux (comes with free socks and sandals these days y'know) but as of late\nit\u2019s started stepping into the domain\nof the big boys, even Dell now supply\nit as an option. The eee comes setup\nwith a simplified Linux desktop called\n\u201ceasy-mode\u201d which can be swapped for\na standard full desktop. If you\u2019re really\nnot interested in dipping your toes in\nthe Linux ocean the manual provided\ngives a full set of simple instructions\non how to install Windows XP and\nsome recommended adjustments to\noptimize the machine.\nB\ny now I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all\nhad a chance to play about\nwith a Wii and found that\nit\u2019s easy to use and (mostly)\ndoes what you want. Today\nwe\u2019re going to delve a bit into how the\nWiimote works and just how Nintendo\ngot it to tick ever so perfectly.\nIn contrast to a regular light gun\nwhich operates off the light emitted\nby the TV, the Wii sensor bar contains\ntwo banks of five infra-red LEDs. The\nWiimote has an image sensor which\nfocuses these into two bright points\nand measures the distance between\nthem. By using this, compared to the\nfixed distance of the LED banks in the\nsensor bar, the Wii can use triangulation (that\u2019s some fancy form of maths\nto you medics) to work out how far\naway from the screen you are and\nwhere you\u2019re pointing. It can also use\nthe offset from horizontal to work out\nthe angle you\u2019re holding the Wiimote\nat, fancy eh?\nThe Wiimote has a few more tricks\nup inside the indestructible shell to\nwork out what you\u2019re doing with it.\nWhilst you\u2019re swinging it with enough\nforce to break that expensive HDTV\nthat you bought a few weeks ago you\u2019re\nactually moving a silicon weight of\nless than one millionth of a gram attached to a few springs. A current runs\nthrough the weight which is measured\nby silicon plates all around, distributing it equally at rest. With that glorious backhand you move the weight\nno more than a whopping five nano-metres, changing how the current is\ndistributed. The Wii calculates how\nsmooth, long and powerful your shot\nwas based upon the voltage change,\nmatches it to a swing in its database\nand decides you were actually aiming\nat the guy with an afro in the crowd!\nThe Wii doesn\u2019t know all this info via\nsome kind of voodoo or black magic; it\nactually uses Bluetooth to talk to your\nWiimote. Now I\u2019ve not tried using my\nphone to play the Wii but it\u2019s the same\ntechnology and does have a built-in\nlimit of up to eight active devices, limiting the Wii to a maximum of seven\nplayers. There\u2019s also a few other nifty\ndevices hidden away in there including\na 3300\u03bcF capacitor in case the batteries\ncome loose during a frantic stick-wag-gling moment, a speaker that\u2019s bloody\nuseful as it\u2019ll bleep within a range of\nup to ten meters to remind you it\u2019s\nyou\u2019re go (even if you\u2019re in the loo) and\na 16KiB EEPROM chip that can store\nyour Mii, Pok\u00e9mon and controller set-up. Now that\u2019s a useful feature!\nFinally, as you probably noticed,\nthere\u2019s a huge port on the bottom of\nthe Wiimote too. Currently you can\nhook the Nunchuk in there and get\nworryingly tangled playing Boxing,\nbut Nintendo does have plans for extra\nconnectivity.\nExpect to get a light gun attachment\nthat mounts the Wiimote along the\nbarrel, a steering wheel and a whole\nhost of other bizarre add-ons. Unfortunately there won\u2019t be a charging\ndock based upon the port as it has limited connectivity. So next time you\u2019re\nfrantically waggling your Wiimote or\nmaking a perfect serve, just remember\nthat you\u2019re moving a block of silicon of\nless than a millionth of a gram no more\nthan five nanometers, aiming with\nsome LEDs and a bit of IR radiation\nwhen all the while the King of Demark\n& Norway oversees that your Wiimote\ntalks fair with your Wii.\nWhat\u2019s inside this magic wand?\nLike taking expensive things apart? Well Andrew Slater will save you some time and money\nOne\u2019s big, one\u2019s small. One\u2019s light, one\u2019s heavy. One\u2019s fiddly, one\u2019s clunky. You\u2019d think with all this crap to worry about, people wouldn\u2019t say \u2018size\ndoesn\u2019t matter\u2019 any more\nOkay, Andrew, if you can\u2019t put it back together what will you do then hmmm?\nYou may look at the power of this\nmachine and think: this is a little retro\nisn't it? My phone has got more grunt.\nWell the fact is, for day to day tasks\nsuch as web browsing (Facebook, webmail etc.) and taking notes in lectures\n(Facebook, webmail etc.) you really\ndon't need much more power than this\nlittle guy puts at your disposal. It could\nbe considered the definitive student\ntool, especially at the loan-friendly\n\u00a3220.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nTechnology\nTechnology Editor \u2013 James Finnerty\n\n"

Merely being in such an aesthetically pleasing environment is enough\nto while away the most azure of blues\nand if you can\u2019t afford a ticket or the\ntime, then try Google images followed\nby a trip to the sunbed for that year-round tan.\nI had any erudite urges satisfied with\nthe myriad of offerings, even from a\nminiscule part of such a diverse con-tinent. And a continent it is. NOT a\ncountry, as one of my friends thought\nit to be. I cringe upon hearing the ignorant refer to Africa as if it were one\nhuge country rife with children with\nswollen bellies and flies in their eyes,\nlions and zebra prowling the streets\nand a permanent soundtrack of bongo\ndrums resonating through the jungle\nas said lions sleep. No, \u201cAfrica\u201d is far\ntoo diverse a place for one not to be\nspecific, when referring to it.\nDespite a horribly cliche and stupidly misspelt name (evoking unwanted\nthoughts of the Afrikaans language),\na show that must be seen is Afrika,\nAfrika, the magical circus adventure\nfrom the amazing continent , which is\ncoming to the O2 arena in a few weeks.\nWith a bit of luck I shall wrangle some\npress tickets and have it all nicely reviewed for you, complete with pictures,\nin a later issue.\nHowever, until then distract yourselves with these pages; procrastinate\nwith the excuse that you are furthering\nyour artistic education as we bring you\nplays, poets and one hell of an inno-vator: Carl Djerassi, who destroys the\nstereotype of the culturally unaware\nscientist confined to a lab. Here is a\nman who embraces science and art and\nintertwines them. Besides, girls, if it\nwere not for him, we would be without\nThe Pill and Lord knows where we\u2019d be\nby now!\nI delve into the weird and wonderful\nworld of William Blake, another man of\nmany talents, who celebrated his 250th\nbirthday in November. The poem of\nthe week is officially a Christmasthemed one but has an optimistic feel,\nwhich would help as we slog through\nthis dreary month. And you can\u2019t go\nwrong with Lord Alfred Tennyson. If\nyou do find yourself reading this col-umn, which I have taken great mirth\nis creating, please do let me/us know\nwhat you think. Until we meet again,\nchins up for the week head! Mwah.\nScientists don\u2019t swear? Well\nwe all know that ain\u2019t true...\nCarl Djerassi is a scientist like no other, bringing us the contraceptive pill and a whole\nhost of plays to boot. Emily Steel had the privilege to meet him. Here\u2019s how she got on\nT\nhere is a wall in Carl\nDjerassi\u2019s flat that is entirely covered with framed\nposters from productions\nof his plays. The posters\nare in Portugese, German, Japanese\nand Bulgarian. Djerassi likes them\nvery much. They represent, for him,\nthe collaborative nature of the theatre,\nthe excitement of re-interpretation. He\npoints out some posters for the first\nplay he wrote, An Immaculate Misconception, about a form of in-vitro\nfertilisation and the questions it raises\nfor reproduction and sexuality. The ti-tle, with its play on words, is difficult\nto translate into languages other than\nEnglish. In one, it has become \u2018This\nsperm is mine\u2019, in another, simply \u2018Immaculate\u2019. Djerassi is pleased by this,\nand pleased by the range of images.\n\u201cLook at this,\u201d he says, of a poster of\nshowing a woman in a pencil skirt,\n\u201cSingapore, which is a pretty conservative place, [but] when you look at it,\nyou think, in some respects, it\u2019s the\nsexiest one, you know, sexy legs and\nstuff like this. What\u2019s she doing? Well,\nshe\u2019s standing in front of a dispenser.\nDo you see what the dispenser is? You\nthink, oh, that it\u2019s cigarettes or something \u2013 it\u2019s babies.\u201d\nCarl Djerassi is best known for the\ninvention of the Pill. He began his\nworking life as a research chemist, and\nin 1951 his team synthesised the first\noral contraceptive. He received the National Medal of Science for that work,\nand the National Medal of Technology\nfor his later work on insect control. He\nis currently an emeritus Professor of\nChemistry at Stanford University. In\nthe last twenty years, however, he has\nbecome a writer, first of fiction and\nmore recently of plays. Interviewers\nregularly ask Djerassi about his scientific work. They rarely ask him about\nthe theatre. And that, he says, is what\nhe\u2019s interested in now.\nMy first sight of Djerassi is at the\nRoyal Society on 14th November,\nwhere he is giving a talk about the\ntreatment of science in fiction and on\nstage. When he gets up to the podium,\nthere is something of the actor about\nhim. He has a headfull of white hair.\nHis white beard comes to a neat point.\nHe is wearing a long, brown jacket that\nlooks, from a distance, almost like Elizabethan costume. He would pass for a\nShakespearean lord, a duke, a king \u2013\nProspero perhaps, even Lear. He talks\nEmergency contraceptive pill advertisment....Thank you Carl Djerassi\nabout his desire to portray the tribal\nbehaviour of scientists in his novels\nand plays, to represent it accurately, as\nonly an insider can. He insists that we\nshould not put scientists on pedestals,\nthat \u201cif you work in a white lab coat,\nyou\u2019re bound to get dirty\u201d. He wants to\nteach this to his readers and audiences,\nto hide proper scientific details in an\nentertaining work, to be, in his words,\n\u201can intellectual smuggler\u201d. He is not\nashamed of being didactic, and when\nhis writing style is criticised he declares that he is willing to pay the price\nof \u2018bad\u2019 writing in order to address\npeople who might otherwise know\nnothing. When the talk is over and he\nsteps down from the podium, like an\nactor he looks smaller in the flesh.\nSome days later, I go round to see\nhim at his home in Maida Vale. We\ntalk about a distinction he has made\nbetween science and the theatre. Scientific writing, he has said, is a mono-logue. Playwriting allows him to work\nin dialogue. It also means a loss of\ncontrol. As Djerassi tells me, the scientist who publishes a paper has absolute authorial power. A play is another\nmatter. \u201cI\u2019ll write a play,\u201d Djerassi says,\n\u201cand I\u2019m happy with it and I\u2019ll send it\nto theatres, and they will take it or not\ntake it, the way a publisher does and\nthat\u2019s that. And of course, completely\nwrong, that\u2019s where the process starts.\u201d\nInitially he was nervous and resentful,\nbut he came to enjoy it enormously. He\nlikes working with directors. He likes\nworking with actors. And when your\nfirst play gets translated into thirteen\nlanguages and is performed all over\nthe world, you can\u2019t cling too tightly\nto what you think it ought to be. \u201cYou\nhave given birth to a baby,\u201d he says,\n\u201cand instead of being extraordinarily possessive about that baby, you are\npleased that you have given it your\ngenes, and you don\u2019t mind if people\ndress your baby up differently, and\nhave it, I don\u2019t know, sometimes stand\non its head, because it shows what you\nare able to do for them that the same\nthing meant very different things to\ndifferent people.\u201d\nHe tells me, however, that he also\nwants his plays to exist as books so that\nthey can be read, as a play can only be\nproduced every so often. He thinks the\nephemeral nature of the theatre can be\nmarvellous, but he is too ambitious as\nan author to accept that for his work.\nHis newest work, Four Jews on Parnassus, is not intended as a play infact,\nbut as a book written in dialogue. It\u2019s\na form, he says, that was more or less\ndropped in the seventeenth century\nbut he wants to revive it. He shows\nme the manuscript, and tells me how\nit was rejected by a series of academic publishers because they said they\ndidn\u2019t publish plays. \u201cAnd I said, it isn\u2019t\na play!\u201d It will be published by Columbia University Press next year.\nWe talk about his belief that only a\nscientist can portray the behaviour of\nscientists accurately. He is quite insistent that this is the case, because one\nmust fully experience a culture before\none can write well about it. He tells me\nthat in one of his first short stories the\ncentral character was a Carmelite nun.\nHe managed to interview one, but he\nis sure that the story was full of simplifications and misrepresentations.\nHe talks about the time his first novel,\nCantor\u2019s Dilemma, was optioned by\na Hollywood studio. They wanted to\nliven up the script by having scientists swearing in the lab. Djerassi was\nhorrified, not because he\u2019s a prude,\nbut because scientists don\u2019t do that.\n\u201cThe critic, or the audience, is not prepared to accept that there is another\nworld, that behaviour is quite different\nthere.\u201d Fortunately, the film was never\nproduced.\nDjerassi\u2019s concern is to tell the truth\nabout science, to reveal the true nature\nof scientists. He is particularly proud\nof his third play, Calculus, which deals\nwith the controversy surrounding\nNewton\u2019s claim to have discovered\nit (the other contender was Leibniz).\nNewton, says Djerassi, \u201cwas a very\ngreat scientist, but he was a terrible\nhuman being.\u201d He thinks it\u2019s important to discuss that, because horrible\nbehaviour and good science are, unfor-tunately, not incompatible. His aim is\nto humanise great scientists and great\nthinkers. The theatre is, of course, the\nperfect place to do so.\nBythetimeIleave,Djerassihastalked\nto me for a full hour. He has been in and\nout of his chair, showing me posters,\nmanuscripts, websites. He is eighty-four years old, and he has more energy\nthan I do. I rethink my idea of him as a\nProspero or a Lear. They both give up\ntheir power. Carl Djerassi \u2013 scientist,\nnovelist, playwright \u2013 is in full possession of his.\nThink of all the trouble these tiny pills have saved us from\n\n"

    "content": "30 felix Friday 11 January 2008\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGames\nEveryone should have heard of Crysis by now due to the sheer volume of hype this game was\ngiven by previewers. In many ways it lives up to, and even surpasses, the expectations, but in\nothers it fell far short of the mark.\nBefore I move on to the way this game plays out lets talk about why this game was been so\nawaited. It\u2019s pretty. Very pretty. Bring a \u00a32,000 top-of-the-line computer to its knees begging for\nmercy pretty. Now on one hand, this seems great but on the other there\u2019s no point in a game\nbeing released if no one can actually play the thing. To handle this, Crytek did a fantastic job\nmaking this title very scalable; running this game on my own mediocre machine still brought\nforth a spectacle of foliage and coast lines that I was more than satisfied with.\nNow let\u2019s step back from the superficial and take a look at whether you will actually want to\nplay Crysis rather than stare at it. The game is split into two major sections. Firstly, there\u2019s the\nhalf before you fight a swarm of more or less identical aliens that leads to a series of repetitive\ngameplay and then the second half, where you\u2019re fighting a swarm of aforementioned generic\naliens. Okay okay, I\u2019m hinting just a bit at what bugs me about this shooter.\nFor breakfast and lunch you tackle a dynamic and tactically intelligent guerrilla army that utilizes cover and will even out-flank you. You can tackle every encounter using your vast set of\ntools to suit your favourite style of combat. Lurk around as a sniper with high powered rifles,\nJames Bond it with silenced pistols or go all Governor of California with an Uzi: its up to you.\nThis truly adds a huge element of re-playability to the single player.\nBrace yourself for the let down: aliens are overrated. After battling the very well-designed\nguerrilla AI for the first half, the second species of opponents is a dismal way to end your experi-ence. They float around slowly and you plug away with the Gauss Rifle (basically a rail gun). Taking them out becomes a very repetitive three-shot game, although there is a bit of a perk where\nyou get to fly in a helicopter and take on the extraterrestrials at their own game.\nAn- other let down is the multiplayer, not because of what the developers pro-duced, but how the users have exploited a few features of the games\nNano Suit (does the same things the predator can do: run fast, become\ninvisible, etc.). Join an online game and you will be swarmed with half\na dozen people running up behind you, while invisible, and\nthen punching you in the back knocking you out in one\nhit. Lame.\nThere is some solace to be found in the hope that\npatches will balance aspects of the multiplayer\nto minimize some of possible exploits.\nTo conclude, I feel this game was a bit\nof a victim of its own hype and it really had to reach an impossible set\nof standards. Brush these preconceptions aside, however,\nand you still have what is\nby anyone\u2019s standard, a\nfantastic shooter.\nCRYSIS\nSo, The Witcher, eh? Hell, I don\u2019t blame you, I hadn\u2019t heard\nabout it either until a friend shoved his copy of it in my hand\nand told me to play it. And now that I have, I\u2019m a bit disappointed that others haven\u2019t heard of this excellent traditional\nRPG from new Polish developers CDProjekt. The Witcher is a\nbrilliant game with oodles of atmosphere, charm and action. It\u2019s\ndifferent enough to feel like a step\nforwards from the same old, same\nold of Western RPGs with a load of new\nimprobable-sounding features that mesh\ninto a well-polished whole.\nBut aside from the streamlined real-time com-bat, the interesting alchemy elements and meaningful character progression, the most significant trait of The\nWitcher is its writing. In a year when Portal showed the world\nthat writing can raise a game from good to mind-blowingly\namazing, this game has raised the bar for RPG writing. For a\ngood 50 hours, the writers sidestep the cliches - this game\nisn\u2019t about winning, saving the world or getting the princess\n(well, it is, but not all the time). The Witcher\u2019s decisions are\nfar more subtle than that, delving deeply into themes of love,\nloyalty, drugs, politics, marriage, racism, rape and trust. NPCs\nhave histories and very real human motivations and, like real\npeople, they all believe they\u2019re doing The Right Thing. It\u2019s up\nto the player to read through the rich dialogue (all of which\nis voice-acted to a high standard) and pick their own path\nthrough it.\nBut perhaps best of all, The Witcher never outright punishes\nyou for any of your decisions, instilling you with an odd sort of\nself-doubt about your actions. And for that alone, The Witcher\nis a game that deserves to be played - because there are very\nfew forms of media that make you sincerely ask yourself \u201cAm\nI doing The Right Thing?\u201d.\n(The retail version of The Witcher suffers from long loading screens and occasional crash\nbugs, all of which are solved by a recent patch. With these technical difficulties out of the way,\nthe game is much easier to recommend to everyone.)\nThe Unreal Tournament series has been around for a\nlong time and has been made into a formula that rarely fails to entertain with frantic, fast paced combat.\nWhen I started to play, I was very surprised to\nsee long cut scenes and even an attempt to give\nwhat was previously mindless, gladiatorial\nstyle combat, some semblance of a plot.\nI can only imagine that the development\nteam has caved under the pressure on the\nnanny state to make the violence soundly\nmotivated. On the other hand, who really\ncares? I don\u2019t think anyone ever bought a\nUT game because it had a good storyline.\nRegardless, the game play is still classic UT.\nRunning around maps that vary in size from quite\nsmall industrial areas to enormous expanses of\nforest or sprawling space stations. The graphics\nare absolutely stunning and, to their credit, the\nUT team refrained from using DX10 which allows\nmid-level systems to still play the game comfortably (however you only really notice how\nmuch the graphics have been improved on a\nrelatively new system). This also means the environments have the expected UT trait of being... sol-id. There\u2019s simply no other word to describe it. Even\nsmall trees and bins are impervious to a hail of rockets.\nThe only objects that are destructible are the vehicles and\nyour enemies!\nA new addition is the hover board\nwhich replaces the Translocator in\nany maps that contain vehicles.\nThis is a fantastic addition to\nthe game that really changes the strategies and encourages teamwork,\nespecially in CTF\ngames as you can\nlatch onto the back\nof vehicles while\non your board\nand be dragged\nalong at high\nspeed, getting\nyou and the\nflag back safe.\nUT3 says\ngoodbye to\nthe Ion Painter\nand the Lightning Gun but\nwe see a welcome return of\nthe sniper rifle.\nAll the weapons,\nas with everything\nelse in the game\nhave had a nice upgrade and I finally feel\nthat the weapons actually look like they were\nmade in the future rather\nthan knocked up in some live\naction gamer\u2019s garage.\nThe multiplayer element of this\ngame, which is really the main selling\npoint, is a little disappointing. The use of\naimbots etc. can become ridiculous (some players literally cannot be killed unless you\u2019re 2 feet away and behind them)\nand I\u2019m certain it will continue as there do not appear to be any\nplans for an anti-cheat system. One area of multiplayer that I really\nmissed was the Bombing Run game which has been replaced with\na tug-of-war style match named Onslaught, where you attempt\ncapture a number of power sources sequentially until you can attack your enemy\u2019s main power node. It does produce longer and\nmore intense games but Bombing Run was a unique gem in multiplayer FPS.\nOverall UT3 is an excellent addition to the series but with games\nlike Crysis and Bioshock competing in the market,\nit really should attempt more and not just be\nsatisfied with a well-implemented makeover.\nUnless you\u2019re a real hardcore UT fan and\nhave bought a new computer recently I\nwould stick with one of the older\nincar- nations as they offer\njust as much entertainment and still look\nbetter on older\nsystems.\nUNREAL TOURNAMENT III\nTHE WITCHER\n\n"

    "content": "science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n4 felix Friday 11 January 2008\nScience\nScience Editor \u2013 Ed Henley\nMonopolar disorder for Maxwell II\n\uf66cB = 0. This equation,\none of Maxwell\u2019s Famous\nFour, is writ in stone for\nmany physicists, who often remember it as being\nequivalent to the statement \u201cthere are\nno magnetic monopoles\u201d. However, a\nrecent letter to Nature verges on the\niconoclastic, as it suggests that monopoles may in fact be found in a type of\nmagnetic material known as spin ice.\nTo understand what a monopole\nmeans, and tackling what Castelnovo\net al. have found, it\u2019s worth having a\ncloser look at the equation above. This\nstates that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero, meaning that isolated sources (or sinks) of magnetic field\ndo not exist \u2013 they must always come\nin pairs, a source and a sink. In day-to-day language, this tells you that a magnet always has a north and a south pole\n\u2013 it isn\u2019t possible to find a magnet with\nonly a north (or south) pole.\nIf one imagines a box around an ordinary magnet, the number of magnetic field lines coming out of the box\nfrom the north pole of the magnet will\nbe exactly balanced by the number of\nfield lines entering the box and going\nto the south pole. Attempts to break\nthis magnet and separate the two poles\nwill be thwarted. Where the break oc-curs, a new pair of poles will be cre-ated, leading to two smaller magnets,\neach with a north and a south pole.\nThe total number of field lines emerging from the original box (or indeed\nfrom smaller boxes around each of the\nsmaller magnets) will still be zero. This\ninability to separate the sources and\nsinks of magnetic field \u2013 effectively\npositive and negative magnetic charge\n\u2013 is in contrast to the sources and sinks\nof electric field, electrons and protons,\nwhich can be isolated. Indeed, the first\nof Maxwell\u2019s equations tells you this \u2013\nthe divergence of the electric field is\nnon-zero; the total number of electric\nfield lines coming out of a box enclosing electric charge is proportional to\nthe amount of charge in the box.\nHowever, although monopoles appear to be absent at all scales from\nthe macroscopic to the subatomic, the\nstatement that they do not exist is experimental \u2013 they have never been ob-served. Yet some theories, such as the\nGrand Unified Theories (GUT) which\ntry to link all the forces in nature, predict that they should exist. Accordingly, various experiments have been\nrun to try to look for them, but thus\nfar have borne little in the way of fruit,\ncertainly nothing universally believed.\nMagnetic monopoles, if they exist, appear to be exceedingly rare.\nYet, the observant reader may ask, if\none puts two smaller magnets end-to-end, the adjacent north and south pole\nClassically forbidden, magnetic monopoles may in fact be allowed in certain types of \"spin ice\". Pretty cool...\ncancel, leaving the north and south\npoles at the further ends. If one continues to add magnets to each end, creating a string of dipoles (north and south\npole pairs), does one not get a magnet\nlong enough that locally (imagine a\nsmall box almost encompassing each\nend) one effectively has a monopole\nat each end of the string? It turns out\nthat separating the monopoles by adding dipoles in this fashion requires en-ergy. Castelnovo et al. point out that in\na vacuum, one has to expend a lot to\nconjure up the required dipoles in be-tween, and even in an ordinary magnet\n(effectively made up of many dipoles,\npredominantly aligned in one direc-tion), one has to expend energy forming domain walls (boundaries separating regions of perfectly aligned dipoles)\nalong the length of the string.\nA team of researchers from the Universities of Warwick, Edinburgh, Dundee and the Czech Republic\u2019s Institute\nof Biophysics have discovered a new\nlight-activated platinum-based compound that is 80 times more powerful\nthan similar cancer treatments.\nWhile commonly used platinum-based anticancer compounds such\nas cisplatin are successful cytotoxic\nagents - they are poisonous to cells -their use is limited due to the frequent\ndevelopment of resistance to treatment\nand side-effects. Such side-effects arise\nwhen healthy tissues are killed alongside the cancer cells. Light-activated\ncancer therapy offers the potential for\ndoctors to target treatments at tumours\nwith great precision and is already used\nwith some success for the treatment of\nnon-melanoma skin cancers and other\ncancers such as tumors of the brain,\nlung and bladder.\nThe team, headed by Professor Peter Sadler at Warwick, has shown that\nthe compound, also known by the\ncatchy name of \u201ctrans, trans, trans[Pt(N3)2(OH)2(NH3)(py)]\u201d, is highly\nstable and non-toxic if left in the dark.\nBut if light falls on it, it becomes much\nless stable and highly toxic to cancer\ncells. In fact, in tests conducted on\nvarious human cancer cell lines, once\nactivated by exposure to UV light the\ncompound was 13-80 times more cytotoxic than cisplatin and was also able to\nkill cisplatin-resistant cancer cells.\nWhat makes this compound remarkable is its high stability in the dark\n(important for a photochemothera-peutic agent as this allows it to reach\ntarget sites before photoactivation) and\nunique mechanism of action, which\nenables it to kill cancer cells resistant\nto other drugs. Professor Peter Sadler\nsaid of their discovery: \u201cLight activation provides its massive toxic power\nand also allows treatment to be targeted much more accurately against\ncancer cells.\u201d\nThe compound has the potential for\nuse in the treatment of surface cancers.\nPatients would be treated in a darkened\nenvironment with light directed at the\ncancer cells containing the compound,\nthus activating the compound and selectively killing those cells. Normal\ncells exposed to the compound would\nbe protected by keeping the patient\nin darkness until the compound has\npassed out of the patient.\nSpeaking to the Guardian, Josephine\nQuerido, of Cancer Research UK, said:\n\u201cDeveloping treatments that attack\ncancer cells but leave healthy tissue\nunharmed is the holy grail of cancer\nresearch.\u201d\nProfessor Martin Glennie, of Southampton University, said the approach\nwas promising, but was more cautious\nabout its life-saving potential. \u201cIt is\nvery rarely the primary cancer that kills\nyou. Usually it\u2019s the cancers that form\nafter it spreads, because they get to the\nlungs, or the brain and everywhere else.\nIt\u2019s impossible to target those because\noften you don\u2019t know where they are.\u201d\nNevertheless, although in the earliest\nstages of development, the researchers are hopeful that in a few years their\ncompound will offer a glimmer of hope\nto some cancer patients.\nIn summary, in order to separate a\npair of monopoles to infinity (a scenario in which each end of the string\ncould certainly be considered locally\nas a monopole), one would require an\ninfinite amount of energy. Since this is\nenergy is not available, the energy cost\nof creating a string means it can only\nreach a finite length (about a thousandth of a millimetre in an ordinary\nmagnet) \u2013 the monopoles at each end\nare \u201cconfined\u201d.\nHowever, the authors, led by Claudio Castelnovo from Oxford\u2019s Rudolf\nPeierls Centre for Theoretical Physics, have shown that in certain types\nof spin-ice, it is theoretically possible\nto create dipole strings of any length\n\u2013 the energy cost does not diverge to\ninfinity as the string is lengthened, so\ndeconfined monopoles are possible.\nThese spin-ice compounds, which\ncontain the rare-earth elements Dysprosium and Holmium (10 points to\nthe reader who\u2019s ever heard of these\nbefore) have a unique structure, which\nlead to a residual disorder in the dipoles at very low temperatures, where\nnormal ferromagnetic materials are or-dered. This structure imposes an \u201cice\nrule\u201d, governing the orientation of the\ndipoles at each vertex of the structure\n\u2013 2 pairs of dipoles must point into\nthe dipole, and 2 out. Local violations\ncan occur (3 in at one vertex) provided\nthey are balanced (by 3 out at a neighbouring vertex). These imbalances are\nnot monopoles in the classical sense of\nfundamental particles with a net magnetic charge, being instead examples of\nwhat is known as an emergent quasip-article \u2013 effective particles which arise\ndue to the bulk interactions within\nelements of a system, and which act\nas if they were real particles. Notably,\nCastelnovo et al have shown that they\nexhibit a phase-change, going from a\nmonopole gas to a liquid, behaviour\nwhich may explain the residual disorder in spin ices at low temperatures.\nThese spin ices exhibit many other\ninteresting properties: amongst oth-ers, the monopoles have a tuneable\nmagnetic charge, and are a rare example of what is known as \u201cfractionalisation\u201d in 3 dimensions. Oleg Tchernyshyov, reviewing the letter in the same\nNature issue, notes that the only other\nexample which comes close is the fractional quantum Hall effect, which is\nhas only been confirmed in 2 dimensional systems. And these monopoles\nmay turn out to be of practical interest\ntoo: Tchernyshyov notes that though\nspin ice will not be able to sustain a direct current of magnetic monopoles, it\nmay be possible to generate an alternating magnetic current, and that if\nwork progresses on directly detecting\nand manipulating monopoles, as Castelnovo et al. hope, technologies such\nas atomic-scale magnetic memories\nmay be in the offing.\nArtificial spin ice, apparently. Looks a bit like that Easter Egg in the old version of Excel. Happy days...\nCompetition Winners\nCongratulations to the winners of last term\u2019s competition!

Non-playing captain Cameron\nSullivan was forced into three changes\nwith Austin Dekker coming into the\nback-row and Harry Thompson replacing Tom Maynard at scrum-half.\nFinally, due to Xander Ancock\u2019s late\narrival, Jeremy Bartosiak-Jentys came\ninto the starting XV.\nThe game\u2019s early stages were largely\nscrappy, not helped by a strong breeze\nwhich blew into the Medicals\u2019s faces\nthroughout the first half. However, as\nthe match developed two clear patterns\nof play emerged. As usual the Medicals\nenjoyed a fair amount of supremacy up\nfront and looked to keep the ball tight\naround the rucks and mauls. Reading\non the other hand looked to spread\nthe ball wide searching for space on\nthe Medicals\u2019 wings. Unfortunately for\nthe assembled spectators both styles\nseemed to cancel each other out for\nmuch of the game.\nWith the match so finely poised, individual errors were always going to\nprovide the best opportunity for either side to score. Lamentably, it was\nthe Medicals who cracked first. Young\nwinger Chidi Nzekwue received the\nball in his own twenty-two. Backing\nhis sensational step and lightning pace,\nChidi looked to beat the cover tacklers on the outside but ended up being bundled towards touch. Looking\nto keep the ball alive the flying Fresher\nturned over possession which allowed\nReading to break through and score.\nThe conversion was missed.\nUnsettled by the Reading score, the\nMedicals were to concede a further try\nsoon after. Looking to counter, Simon\nBellringer hoisted a high ball into the\nReading half. Despite the good chase,\nReading were able to exploit the broken play to slice through the home\nsides defence and touch down under\nthe posts. The conversion was added\nto give the visitors a 12-0 lead. Thankfully, these were Reading\u2019s last points\nof the day.\nWith time expired in the first-half,\nthe Medicals were awarded a penalty on halfway. Being the last play,\nthe home side took a quick tap and\nputting good phases together worked\ntheir way into the Cardiff twenty-two.\nHere Reading conceded yet another,\nfar more kickable, penalty. Fly-half\nDan Neville strode up confidently and\nstroked over the penalty thus bringing\nthe first half to a close.\nDuring the interval Keith Green\npulled no punches and left the Medicals under no illusions as to what was\nrequired in the second half. BartosiakJentys and Rory Hutchinson were\nfor the guillotine as Xander Ancock\nand Guy Martin entered the fray. The\nhome side took the advice to heart and\nstarted the second half brightly. Soon\nNeville was adding a further 3 points\nto the Medicals\u2019 tally with another superbly struck penalty. Riding the crest\nof a wave, the Medicals were to get\nthemselves right back in the game with\na superbly worked try. After Dan Neville and James Sharples had combined\nwell in midfield Craig Nightingale took\nthe ball on the Reading twenty-two.\nBreaking a tackle, Nightingale was able\nto feed full-back Bellringer who hit a\ngreat line to dive in spectacularly in the\ncorner. Neville was unable to add the\nextras.\nNowonlytrailingby1point,thehome\nside looked to take control of the game\nand calmly score the points required\nfor victory. By contrast, Reading began\nto try more imaginative moves, which,\nIC Medics topple Reading after 12-0 deficit\nJeremy Bartosiak-Jentys\nwhilst looking well conceived, never\nreally threatened the Medicals line. In\nfact, rather against the run of play, the\nMedicals were awarded a penalty in\nfront of the posts. Once again Neville\nmade no mistake and with 15 minutes\nremaining the home side were in the\nlead for the first time. After 65 minutes\nGary Woodsford and Richard Nowicki\ncame on to replace Chris Hallewell and\nAustin Dekker respectively.\nThe closing stanza closely resembled\nthe game\u2019s opening period as the match\ndescended into a scrappy affair, partly\ndue to a serious-looking injury to Simon Bellringer which left both sides\ntrying to keep warm for a number of\nminutes. With all substitutes used the\nMedicals had to play out the closing\nminutes with only 14 men. Nevertheless, aided by some fortuitous refereeing decisions, the home side was able\nto hang on.\nBUSA Rugby Union\nPREM South B\nP W D L Diff Pts\n1 Cardiff Med 8 6 1 1 66 19\n2 Swansea 8 5 0 3 77 15\n3 W.

Unlike women\u2019s\nfootball, the 4s went with the age-old\ntradition of 11 players, despite 2 late\nwithdrawals from the squad, which led\nto a new formation and new personnel.\nJames \u201cThe Shadow\u201d Skeen was forced\nto don the keeper\u2019s gloves rather than\ntake up his usual role as the weak link\nin defence, and Sam Rickards and El\nPerry came in at centre mid and right\nwing respectively.\nIC started typically slowly, and went\nbehind within 10 minutes. A great\nthrough ball from the QM midfield\nwas latched onto by their striker, who\noutpaced the IC defence to slot home.\nIC came back into the game and were\nridiculously denied an equaliser by a\nlinesman more corrupt than Robert\nMugabe. Sam penetrated the defend-Imperial steal a draw as Queen Mary\u2019s get lairy\nFootball\nImperial Men\u2019s 4ths 3\nQueen Mary\u2019s Men\u2019s 3rds 3\nEd Lobb\ner to score between his legs, only to\nsomehow be given offside. It\u2019s possible\nthat the linesman was so impressed\nby this attacking master class that he\nwaved his flag in celebration, a gesture\nmisinterpreted by the ref to be an offside flag. This only served to fire up\nthe home side and their pressure was\nmade to count when Jeremy \u201cJ-Bruv\u201d\nLovett, playing as part of an effective 3\nman midfield with Rickards and Matty\nSmith, picked up the ball 20 yards out\nand lashed it into the bottom corner.\nSkeen was called into action soon\nafter, displaying uncharacteristic alertness and reflexes to keep out a close\nrange effort from QM\u2019s rotund striker,\nFlex QC, and then again to put him\noff after a clearance ran all the way\nthrough. IC however went behind\nagain when a corner wasn\u2019t properly\ncleared, and the ball was floated into\nthe top corner, leaving Skeeno strand-ed. 2-1 at half time.\nEarly in the 2nd half IC centre backs\nAubergine and Lobster picked up\nheavy knocks, leaving the already slow\nIC defence about as mobile as Jon Hill.\nIC conceded again when a QM midfielder kidnapped the ball from Sam\nand waltzed through the defence to\nscore, making it 3-1. IC could have\nhit the wall, a beaten team, but got a\nmuch needed shot in the arm when a\nwalkover for the 6s provided the opportunity for some substitutions. Sim\nSimilisimisim replaced Perry giving\nsome much needed energy to the right\nside and support for the Gut Phelan up\nfront. Almost immediately left-winger\nJon Hill picked up a nasty shin injury\nand had to be replaced by another 6s\nplayer, Mike Turrell.\nCaptain Aubergine was struggling\nwith injury and spent the last half hour\nin the centre circle, where he was cautioned for a 2 footed, late sliding tackle\nin an attempt to stop their centre mid\nplaying football... Ever again. This\nforced Toby and makeshift left back\nYou\u2019d think they were jumping for a gold bar or something judging by\nthe desperation in their expressions\n\u201cTake those socks back to Debenhams now!

    "content": "games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n31\nFriday 11 January 2008 felix\nGames\nSPORE\nOK, first things\nfirst: Will Wright is God.\nBut not only that, he gives\nyou the power too. Creator of the most popular PC\ngame ever, The Sims, as\nwell as the frankly magical SimCity, he developed\nworlds entirely under your\ncontrol. Now he wants to\ntake you one step further:\nhis new creation, Spore,\nwill grant you the potential\nto control the very evolution of a species. From\nthe beginnings of life itself\nto the spawn of a galactic civilisation, Spore will\nguide you through the\nages, where according to\nthe man himself, almost\nanything can happen.\nThat is, if it ever gets\nreleased.\nCurrently eight years in\nthe making, Spore was\nfirst announced at the\n2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo. Electronic\nArts, who bought Wright\u2019s\nsoul in the form of Maxis\nSoftware over ten years\nago, have announced a\ntentative release date\nof spring 2008. This\ndefinitely remains\nto be seen, how-ever, as while\nWright has\nstated that the\ngame is currently fully-playable, no\nreal demonstrations\nhave come\nforth and\nthe company remains\ntight-lipped\nabout the\nactual depth\nof the game.\nThe Spore development team aim to create\nwhat could potentially be the\nmost open-ended video game\nin history \u2013 a monumental task\nby anyone\u2019s standards. As a re-sult, many are sceptical of the\ngame, leading some to claim it\nas \u201cvapourware,\u201d despite the\ngame being seemingly on track\nfor the release date, and others\nto doubt its level of creativity,\neven before it goes gold. This\nis balanced, however, by the\ngrowing number of fan communities centred on its eventual\nrelease, geared towards discussion of the game and a means\nto effectively share the content\nthat the users create.\nThe game\u2019s premise is simple\nto explain, but tough to create\nin practice: a comet crashes on\na planet of the player\u2019s choos-ing, causing the complex reactions which culminate in living\norganisms. As these organisms\nthrive, they evolve into more interesting creatures, which then\nformsocieties,whichmergeinto\ncivilisations, which\nthen, as\nwith\nhuman beings, seek to explore the universe to perhaps\nfind some life apart from their\nown. During all this, the player\ncan manipulate not only the\nstructure of the overall system\nbut the creatures themselves,\ncontrolling both their physical\nmakeup and to a lesser extent,\ntheir thoughts and actions. In\nthis, it is quite representative of\nMaxis\u2019 earlier games. However,\nas Spore spans such a great\ntransition, from single microbes\nto advanced city-states, the level\nof control must change accord-ingly. As you progress through\nthe five stages, the control over\nindividuals is relinquished in favour of more direct control over\nthe entire population.\nThe Spore development team\nare very keen to promote their\ncontent-sharing service, which\nautomatically uploads your\nplanets to a central database.\nThis information is then shared\nwith other players, who can\ndownload the planets and explore them in their own game.\nThe game features a\nreporting system\nwhich should inform a player\nof how\ntheir\ncreatures are faring in other uni-verses, including the number\nof times another player has destroyed their own planet. While\nit seems like a fairly gimmicky\nidea, it opens doors to vast possibilities \u2013 for example, you could\ngroom your creatures towards\ncreating alliances and therefore\nprotecting them as they venture\nout into the multiverse.\nPerhaps the most interesting\ncomponent of Spore from a scientific perspective is what we call\nprocedurally-generated content.\nSimply put, it is a method of creating the objects in game using\nalgorithms, in order to both minimise the storage needed for the\nhumongous number of possible\ncreations and to maximise the\npotential diversity throughout\nthe game. While in most games,\neach character, building and tree\nis created by an artist, allowing\nthe computer to randomly generate the objects in the game\non the fly lets us open up whole\nworlds of never-before-seen\ncontent. When combined with\na large variety of textures based\non the real world to add realism to the picture, this can allow\nfor massive replayability and\nwill give players a warm fuzzy\nfeeling inside, as you can guarantee their care-fully-groomed\ncreatures are\nunique throughout the planet.\nNot all is ran-dom, however:\nonce we\u2019ve created the random\ncreature, along\nwith its surround-ings, more strict\nalgorithms are\nused in order to\nhelp the creatures\nevolve and adapt\nto their environ-ment. Rather\nthan sporadically\ngrowing new\nlimbs, these effects are more\nsubtle: losing\nan unnecessary\ntail, or sprouting\nclaws to ward off\nenemies. A combination of these\ntwo methodologies should mean\nthat you never\nplay the same\ngame twice.\nA bit of variety between each\nplay is perhaps\nnecessary: with\ntoday\u2019s games\nconcentrating\nperhapstoomuch\non an epic sto-ryline, Spore slides\nneatly into the gap\nleft, where players are\ngiven a virtual sandbox\nto run the world as they\nsee fit. These so-called\n\u201cgod\u201d games have always had a place in the\ngamer\u2019s heart, where\nthey can let loose and\ncreate (or destroy) to\ntheir heart\u2019s desire. Perhaps the power is what\nattracts them, perhaps\nthe freedom, or maybe\njust a need to discover\nthe possibilities lent\nto them by a game so\nfast, but I have a feeling that if it is released\ncome spring, Spore will\nspawn a new craze in\nan industry just realising its potential.\nWell, until Duke\nNukem Forever comes out,\nobviously.\nSTARCRAFT II\nMay 19, 2007 may be a\nlong forgotten day in the\nmemories of the majority,\nbut for the 10,000 Koreans\nwho attended Blizzard\u2019s\nWorldwide Invitational it\nremains a sacred moment\nas Blizzard unveiled its latest product. Yes, finally\nStarcraft II has made it to\nthe screens and the world\nwas in awe. Shortly after-wards, the internet was\nconsumed with ecstasy.\nAt first look, the game is\nsimilar to its predecessor\nbut revamped with alluring graphics: a significant\nimprovement over the\nnow simplistic visuals\nof the original. The\ngame boosts new\nfeatures coupled\nwith a array of\nunits\nboth old\nand new. Starcraft\ngamers will recognise the familiar Protoss zealot, which has the\nability to charge and engage in\nmelee combat or the zergling\nswarm, now capable of mutating into suicidal bombs. They\nwill not recognise new units\nsuch as the Protoss Immortal,\na powerful cybernetic warrior\nthat can nullify powerful attacks\nwith its shield nor initially comprehend the power of a Protoss\nMothership till they have witnessed the \u2018Black Hole\u2019 wipe out\nentire armies. Now, ambushes\ncan be made onto unsuspecting units by those that are positioned on higher tiers of terrain\nwhilst remaining invisible by\nthe fog of war.\nOnline gamers are promised\nwith an improved ladder\nsystem similar\nto the one currently\nin operation for Warcraft\nIII, fostering true competition.\nRising to the top levels would\nbe challenging no doubt, having seen the uber micro skills\nof aficionados. Players eager\nplay single-player can watch\nthe Starcraft saga unfold as the\nepic tale continues.\nWith the enormous size of\nthe Blizzard fanbase in worldwide (especially in Korea where\nStarcraft is considered a sport)\nand the vast interest generated,\nthe game has been hyped up\nto be a big success. However,\nBlizzard\u2019s major challenge is to\nbring Starcraft II into an already\nsaturated market whilst satisfying hardcore gamers maintaining the level of quality that the\noriginal had delivered. A challenge that is yet to be tested...\n\n"

Following the 2nd liberation\nof 2002 which saw the fall of the oppressive 24 year regime established by\nPresident Daniel Moi, the country had\ncome away with a renewed belief in it-self, in democracy. Would 2007 be the\nyear Kenya proved beyond any shadow\nof doubt that true democracy stands\na chance in Africa? Sitting President\nMwai Kibaki\u2019s re-election bid faced\na credible threat in the person of the\ncharismatic Mr Raila Odinga, an ex-member of President Kibaki\u2019s cabinet who had led a veritable rebellion\nagainst the government mid-term for\nits alleged failure to deliver the radical change it had promised Kenyans in\n2002. Opinion polls predicted a close\nvictory for Mr Odinga, making Kibaki\nthe first sitting president in Kenyan\nhistory to be voted out of office. Both\nsides, however, remained confident of\nvictory.\nMr Kibaki had an impressive track\nrecord to call upon. Coming into\npower in 2002, his had been the challenge of reviving an economy ravaged\nby decades of chronic mismanage-ment. The LSE alumnus and former\nacademic proved himself equal to the\ntask. By privatizing industry, providing\nfree primary education, cutting overall\nspending, creating business incentives\nand investing in IT, he helped build a\nknowledge-based economy that is fast\nbecoming a regional hub for outsourc-ing, call centers and banking. In 2007\nalone General Electric, Young & Rubicam, Google, Coca Cola and telecom-municationsgiantCeltelrelocatedtheir\nAfrican headquarters to the country\u2019s\ncapital. Exports reached record highs\nfor coffee, tea and flowers, a $600 million industry. And since 2002, 1.8 million new jobs have been created and\nper capita income has increased from\n$400 to $630, according to government\nfigures. Kenya\u2019s economy, the biggest\nin the East Africa region, has shown\na booming average growth of 5% per\nannum since 2002. The democratic\nspace also improved dramatically. In\nNovember 2005, the Kenyan electorate\nresoundingly defeated a new draft constitution proposed by parliament and\nendorsed by the President himself.\nGiven his achievements, one could\nbe forgiven for assuming Mr Kibaki\u2019s\nre-election was a given. Not so. Enter\nKenyan elections stir violence\npledged to focus on economic growth,\nwill be sworn in on February 25th. Mr\nLee also wants to take a tougher stance\non its northern neighbour, reducing\naid and punishing it for its weapons\nprograms.\nMore trouble in Sudan\nSudanese forces opened fire on a clearly marked UN / African Union convoy\nlate on Monday night. \u201cThe secretary-general condemns this attack in the\nstrongest possible terms,\u201d a spokesperson said on behalf of Ban Ki Moon.\nThe UN initiated a new peace keeping mission at the beginning of 2008,\nreplacing an overburdened AU force\nwith 20,000 troops. The government\nin Khartoum insists that claims by the\nUN and \u2018Western media\u2019 that 200,000\npeople have died and several million\nhave been displaced in Darfur are an\nexaggeration aimed at undermining it\nfor other political goals.\nClinton survives New Hampshire\nvote\nDemocrats have begun the process of\nchoosing their candidate to stand in\nthis year\u2019s upcoming Presidential elections in the US. Kenyans set aside their\nown civil strife to celebrate their \u2018son\u2019\nBarrack Obama\u2019s victory in the first\ncaucus held in Iowa. The front-runner,\nNew York Senator Hillary Clinton,\nlooked shaken on Monday after coming third and then slipping 10 points in\nthe opinion polls for New Hampshire.\nHowever, her teary eyed interview\nappeared to help her campaign, coming first on Tuesday\u2019s poll. John McCain was the surprise winner on the\nRepublican front after a summer of\npoor fundraising and little media at-tention.

Bana faces extradition to Spain after authorities there\nwant him in connection with the Madrid bombings of 2004.\nThe closely fought election which returned President Kibaki to power has sparked allegations of rigging\nRaila Odinga, the self-styled \u2018People\u2019s\nPresident\u2019. A key factor in Mr Odinga\u2019s\nfavour was the failure of Kenya\u2019s economic renaissance to reach the common mwananchi (Swahili for citizen).\nOdinga argues that Kenya\u2019s economic\ngains of the past few years are only being felt by a select group of Kenyans,\nwith heads of business and the already-rich the main beneficiaries. In a country where the poverty rate stands at 46\nper cent, it is easy to see where Odinga\nfound an audience. Describing himself as a social democrat, he promised\nto spend considerably to improve the\nsituation in Nairobi\u2019s notorious slums\n(Kibera, in the outskirts of the city,\nis Africa\u2019s largest), provide low-cost\nhousing and give cash transfers to the\nvery poor. Key also to Mr Odinga\u2019s\ncampaign was Mr Kibaki\u2019s failure to\ncomprehensively deal with corruption in his own cabinet, which saw the\ncountry lose millions of dollars in the\nform of shady government contracts.\nSadly though, politics in Kenya is\ndecidedly tribal. Consider for instance\nthe fact that in Central Province, ancestral home of members of the President\u2019s Kikuyu tribe, Kibaki won 98% of\nall votes cast. Or the fact that in parts\nof western Kenya, where Mr Odinga\u2019s\nLuo tribe are the majority, Kikuyus\nand known supporters of Kibaki were\ndenied access to polling stations, with\nthreats made upon their lives should\nthey show up. The fact is that, especially in rural Kenya, the tribal identity\nprecedes the national. And while the\ncountry\u2019s 43 tribes have learned to coexist as Kenyans, a healthy amount of\nmistrust still exists between different\ntribes, which politicians freely exploit\nto achieve their own ends. A characteristic of the Kibaki administration was\nthe prominence of members of central\nKenya tribes in the cabinet and in the\nPresident\u2019s inner circle. Although it\ncan be argued that they were all appointed on merit and demonstrated\nperformance, this threw the field open\nto accusations of tribalism. Members\nof smaller tribes felt threatened, and\nwhen Odinga\u2019s voice promised them\nprotection and a voice in a new government they were only too glad to\njump aboard.\nGiven this kind of political climate,\na close election was always going to\nspell trouble. Few however, could have\npredicted the scale of what happened\nwhen Mr Odinga controversially lost\nthe poll. Fear of the majority Kikuyu\ntribe turned to hatred and outright\nviolence on a scale never before wit-nessed. Over 300 have now been killed,\nwith as many as 250,000 displaced\nfrom their homes by tribal tensions.\nTalks between both sides towards\npeace are due to begin but whatever\nthe outcome, an ugly scar has been left\nin the pages of Kenyan history and has\nseriously set back the development of\na national identity in this young and\nfragile democracy.\nAnthony Maina\nAllegations of vote rigging in the ethnically divided country have left hundreds dead\n\n"

Blake was a true Londoner, born\non 28th November 1757; he lived only\nfour years away from the confines of the\ncity and in his lifetime gave us a host\nof vivid poems and magnificent paint-ings, as well as his engravings. We were\ntreated to a sample of Blake\u2019s powerful\npaintings in the form of a slide show\nthroughout the talks. It is clear from\nthe solid and muscular characters in\nthe paintings that Blake was influenced\nby his time spent drawing the statues\nin Westminster Abbey. \u201cDark, satanic\u201d\nsprings to mind upon looking at some\nof the paintings and it is hard not to\nthink of Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s Garden\nof Earthly Delights. However, his work\nhas an escapist, fantastical feel to it and\nmany of his works incorporate scenes\nof a more uplifting nature. Artist, poet,\nengraver and prophet, he is highly\nlauded today, achieving the fame and\nfollowing he deserves only after his\ndeath.\nHosted by Poet in the City and The\nBlake Society, the evening was a delightful event where one was given an\ninsight into the character, life, poetry\nand paintings of William Blake as well\nas being treated to enlightening talks\nThe Ancient of Days (God as an Architect) by William Blake (1794)\nand performances from notable au-thors, poets and actors. Poet in the City\nis a charity striving to bring poetry to\nnew audiences as well as raising money\nto support poetry education. The charity\u2019s chairman introduced the talk with\nsome of Blake\u2019s own thoughts on the\nmatter of science versus art. At first\nglance it seemed that Blake regarded\nscientists with a slight disdain, \u201cThey\nmock inspiration and vision\u201d \u2013 two\nthings which Blake thought of as his\nelements: \u201chis eternal dwelling place\u201d.\nHe was also opposed to the \u201csingle\nvision\u201d of scientific materialism. The\npoet certainly was a character. Suffering from numerous nervous disorders,\nhe was ever the contrarian in many\nthings he did and would have shocked\nmany with his radical views. Had it not\nDeath on a Pale Horse (1800)\nbeen for these attributes, his originality and his vibrant imagination, perhaps we would not have been blessed\nwith such an array of talent and beauty.\nRather like Poet in the City, Blake was\nextremely keen to bring poetry to the\nforefront of the arts.\nTim Heath, chairman of the Blake\nSociety, echoed the thoughts which\nwould have been in the minds of many\n\u2013Is Imperial College, scientific leader,\nan appropriate place to hold such an\nevent?

    "content": "21\nFriday 11 January 2008 felix\nStrange and Svarmod: it\u2019s Sweden\nThe Xenophobe\u2019s Guide to the Swedes\nstates that \u2018a common trait among\nSwedish people is a deeply felt sv\u00e5rmod, a dark melancholy born out of\nlong winters, high taxes, and a sense\nof being stuck out on a geo-political\nand socio-economic limb. They brood\na lot over the meaning of life in a self-absorbed sort of way without ever arriving at satisfactory answers.\u2019\nI have been to Sweden twice, and I\ncould tell you all about what there is\nto see in Malmo and Lund, and how\nthey have a nice town hall and so forth\nbut I think a far more interesting article would be to justify the statement\nfrom the Xenophobe\u2019s Guide, and to\nspread the word about the oddities of\nthe Swedes and Sweden. But, as this\nis the travel section, allow me to write\na few words about Malmo so that you\ncannot complain that I have not done\nmy duty.\nMalmo is the third largest city in\nSweden. Let me just warn you that the\nway Sweden is squished at the top of\nthe World Map makes it seem deceptively small, when it is actually the third\nlargest country in Europe \u2013 if you were\nto travel the same distance Sweden\nstretches from its most northern tip\nto the most southern, you would end\nup in Rome! (I would therefore recommend travelling southwards). Considering that Sweden has such a large\narea, I would have expected Malmo to\nbe a busy, bustling, metropolitan city.\nTravels without my Aunt \u2013 part six: A journey to Epping\nTheo Georgeiou Delisle \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d\n\u201cYou took too long, Sir, I\u2019m afraid, the\npackage will be returned to your local\nPost Office delivery depot.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou can collect it in 5-7 days,\ndepending.\u201d\n\u201cDepending on what?\u201d\n\u201cJust depending, goodbye Sir.\u201d\nNow I have got that off my chest it\nis time to go down to the woods, Epping Forest to be precise, where there\nmay or may not be a surprise waiting\nfor you.\nThe forest once sprawled across\nmuch of the South-east of England but\nnow has been tamed and beaten back\ninto submission. That is not to say\nthat you cannot get lost in the forest,\nas I have, twice. Some might say that\nI couldn\u2019t see the wood for the trees\nbut it was more of a case of not being\nable to see the trees for the driving hail\nand lack of available light source at the\ntime.\nPerhaps the best way to enjoy the full\ngrandeur of Epping Forest is to pack\na light lunch, grab your best walking\nboots and head off into the unknown.\nUnless of course if you know where\nyou are going, in which case just follow\nthe path that you usually use and you\nhave nothing to fear. It would be true to\nsay that the forest is abundant in trees,\nspecifically oak trees, from which the\npopular saying \u201cYou know you are in\n\u201cRing ring, ring ring,\u201d\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\u201cHello, Sir,\u201d\n\u201cAh, hello,\u201d\n\u201cI have your package outside for you,\nSir, just pop downstairs and open the\ndoor and I can give it to you.\u201d\n\u201cOh, that is good, the package I have\nbeen waiting for, for all this time, and\nnow it\u2019s here!\u201d\n\u201cYou understand the situation per-fectly, Sir.\u201d\n\u201cOk, I\u2019m coming down to answer the\ndoor then.\u201d\n\u201cVery good, Sir.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.\u201d\nNadine Richards\nTravel Editor\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nTravel\nTravel Editors \u2013 Ahran Arnold and Nadine Richards\nThe problem with Sweden is that it has\nthe population almost the equivalent to\nthat of London, about 9 million people,\nbut this is spread throughout an area\ninfinitely larger. Therefore, Malmo\nis more reminiscent in stature of Sidcup in Kent than Liverpool, which is\nEngland\u2019s equivalent as the third largest city. Which may be good thing to\nbe honest, depending on your affinity\nfor chavs. Sightseeing in Malmo will\nbring you the exciting pleasures of The\nCity Hall, Lilla Torg (the main square),\nFolkets Park, Western Harbor, the City\nLibrary, and its most famous attraction\n\u2013 the Turning Torso. No, this is not a\ndisplay of a Viking being turned constantly at a stake \u2013 the Turning Torso\nis a twisted skyscraper where the uppermost floor is at 90 degrees to the\nground. Engineers of Imperial- go\ncrazy!\nSo, yes, we have established that Sweden is indeed isolated and I would like\nto suggest the hypothesis that oddities\nseem to develop in people who do not\nhave enough human contact. Just take\na look at the Welsh.\nPolitically, the country just gets\nweirder. They say that Sweden is a socialistic utopia. They also say that all\nSwedish people are born free but get\ntaxed to death. In Sweden, taxes are\ngenerally 50-70% of your income (of\ncourse, your employer already pays\nthe full amount of your salary to the\ngovernment in taxes before you even\nget anything), so we really should stop\ncomplaining about the 17.5% VAT here\nin the UK. At least they have made the\nprocess of filling out tax forms easy; as\nof 2004 you can pay your Swedish taxes\nby sending an SMS message from your\nmobile phone. If this is too much has-sle, then try an alternative system- the\ngovernment sends out a completely\nfilled-in tax form and if it looks good,\nyou can just go online and click \u2018okay\u2019\nto pay your taxes.\nThis begs the question, to what good\ncause do these earnestly paid taxes go\ntowards? Well, Sweden boasts many\nbonuses that you could not receive\nhere. For example, you can take sick\nleave during your vacation if you are ill.\nIn addition, all employees get 5 weeks\nof paid vacation a year (which explains\nwhy for such a small population, there\nare always Swedes to be met abroad),\nand most appealing of all is that, as\nof 2004, all employers are required to\nprovide a free massage.\nThe Swedes are also the most en-vironmentally-friendly people in the\nworld. And with all that gloriously\ngreen land spare to look after, why\nshouldn\u2019t they be? Taxes are therefore\nput to use to help maintain the Swedish obsession with recycling. Obsession is no exaggeration. In fact, recycling is taken so seriously that one\ncompany (FTI) has been trying to put\nup video cameras to make sure people\nsort their recyclables correctly. Now\nrecycling is all very well, but it is also\nquite a time-consuming process when\nthere are 39 different types of bins in\nwhich to sort out every type of material you own. Thankfully, the \u2018pant\u2019\nsystem is employed in Sweden, where\none is compensated for your time by\nreceiving money as a reward for recycling cans and bottles. I have, however,\nheard that recycled toilet paper can be\nan unpleasant experience: not quite\nCharmin, but more reminiscent of using cardboard.\nPerhaps all this might explain why\nI have never encountered a normal\nSwedish person. This might be an unfair judgement considering that I have\nnot met loads of Swedes, but with the\npopulation of Sweden being equivalent\nto that of London, I\u2019d like to think that\nthis judgement is well founded on the\ngrounds that thinking in terms of pro-portion, I have met an (almost) equivalent number of Swedes representing\nSweden to the English representing\nEngland. Certainly, the Swedes I have\nmet have been rather odd - or a self-confessed \u201cvery unique\u201d as one friend\nput it. On that note, I leave you with\nthe tale of Pippi Longstocking, which\nis not all that relevant; except that this\nis the only Swedish cultural reference I\ncan point you in the direction of with\nthe exception of Abba. Longstocking is a freckled brat with intractable\nbraids and is also Sweden\u2019s biggest literary hit. With nobody to supervise\nher, she leads a life of carefree, barefoot\nabandon, breaking every rule possible.\nShe is therefore the opposite representation to a society governed by very\nparticular conventions. I like to think\nthat every Swedish person has a Pippi\nwithin them longing to break free, but\nthe pressures of social convention force\nthem to restrain themselves. Repression is not always healthy, and so results in their strange behaviour, along\nwith the accompanying gloomy sense\nof svarmod that they are not allowed\nto release their inner Pippi\u2019s (except\nto PeePee). Well, that\u2019s just my theory\nanyway.\nEpping Forest when you see an oak\ntree, and you are also standing in Epping Forest\u201d arises. It is not the trees\nhowever that contrive to spoil the wild,\nrugged, wilderness of Epping Forest, it\nis the people who visit it. Specifically,\nI wish to highlight the younger tree\ndwelling communities who believe that\nFriday night was solely designed for\naccompanying a large bottle of extra\nstrong cider on a date into the bowels\nof the undergrowth. The aftermath of\nthese drink-fuelled excursions leaves\nwhole patches of the forest bare, where\na combination of lighter fuel, fire and\nregret consumes all plant forms in a\nten-metre radius.\nIt is said, however, that there are dark\npowerful forces at work within the\ndepths of Epping Forest \u2013 a man made\nof mud, some murmur under hushed,\nbreathless gasps. The Mudman of the\nBush is said to act in order to preserve\nthe forest for future generations and\nawakens only when hoodies enter the\nhallowed moonlit clearings and mess\nit up. Local villagers now look to the\nfabled mud-man, who calls out \u201cI am\nMudman not Beowulf!\u201d at midnight\nevery other Thursday, in hope that he\nmight rid them of the plague of youths\nwho blight their lives. The police, how-ever, consider Mudman to be more of\na rapist hiding in the woods. Only Epping Forrest knows the truth, and that\nis that Mudman is indeed a rapist.\nPippi Longstocking\u2019s influences have spred far and wide\nThe hills are aliiiive, with the Sound of Muuuusic... No wait, that was Austria\n\n"

Most of the\ngroup went with DR on the minibus,\nbut four adventurous members were\nelected(/forced by Sieve) to take the\nOxford tube. This turned out to be\nmuch better as we had lots of room\nand were able to consume large quantities of Haribo! The adventurous four\nbumped into the rest just outside our\nhostel in the centre.\nAfter getting everyone booked in,\nwe headed into the town centre for\nour first night out. We stopped off\nat Pizza Hut on the way in, but some\npeople took exception to having to\nbeg/shout/cajole the waiters into serving us food and went up the road for\na much cheaper and tastier pub meal.\nHockey freshers tour to Oxford(\u2019s nightclubs)\nHockey\nOxford University 4\nImperial College 2\nIan Lawrence\nWe met up with them in the Goose\nand the drinking games commenced.\nAfter one too many \u201cmasters\u201d (includ-ing spider man master, thumb master,\nhead master, air-raid master and Jack\nmaster!) there was a bit too much\nchaotic behaviour and we bid a hasty\nretreat! Round the corner our guide\nfor the weekend, Fourplay, led us to a\npokey little club that we quickly made\nour own. The rest of the evening was\nspent dancing, drinking crap sugary\ndrinks, stopping the crazy guy fighting\nwith everyone in our club and laughing at the copious amounts of sharking\ntaking place!\nOn Saturday morning everyone\nblearily stumbled out of bed in time\nfor the hostel\u2019s breakfast. After some\nshuttling in the minibus, everyone got\nto St Edward\u2019s school in time. We met\nup with Moonie, Jammy Dodger and\nToadfish, who were too cool to come\non Friday night and had a little tournament amongst ourselves. The captains\nof the sides were all freshers and the\nwinning one would captain us against\nthe Oxford Blues side on Sunday (I\nthink this is why Star Trek threw the\ngame!). With Jess the eventual winning\ncaptain and looking forward to the next\nday we had the afternoon to go shop-ping. Specifically for white shirts from\nPrimark which were graffitied with appropriate slogans and comments from\nother club members\u2026\nThese artistic shirts were worn to\nthe curry house for the start of the\nevening\u2019s entertainment. By this time\nour numbers had swelled to 31 and the\ncurry house looked a bit shocked when\nwe turned up. Despite having obviously laid out long tables for us, they\nwere still unsure if we had booked or\nnot! The food was pretty good, and as\nthe booze was bring your own, the Tesco\u2019s down the road did a roaring trade\nthat night! We decamped to a local\npub for an impromptu fine circle led\nby the night\u2019s fine master Cotton-Eyed\nJoe. While we didn\u2019t have enough time\nfor everyone\u2019s fines, all important participants in the previous night\u2019s misde-meanours got their punishments!\nIt was a short walk from here to the\nnight club, in somebody\u2019s basement!\n(or so it seemed!) Some people didn\u2019t\nfeel like clubbing two nights in a row\nand went off and played cards back at\nthe hostel (mostly guys, so not strip\npoker, I hope!). For those of us it was\na pretty carnage-filled night, with lots\nmore sharking and drinking! I also\nbumped into the Oxford Blues captain\nwho were going to play us the next\nday, good to see they prepare for their\nmatches as thoroughly as we do!\nWe had a fairly relaxed start to the\nSunday morning, cleared out of the\nhostel and got a cooked breakfast and\ncoffee from a nearby pub, just the thing\nto wake you up! We went to the Oxford\nBrookes pitch to play the Oxford Blues\nat 2pm. Yours truly was umpiring and\nwhile it started off as a friendly, both\nteams quickly got very competitive!\nWe were worried we would get soundly destroyed by a club whose first team\nplays in BUSA premier league, but that\nwasn\u2019t the case. It was very competitive\nthe whole way through, but the difference between the teams did prove to be\na couple of Oxford first teamers linking up well. We started well by scoring\nthe first goal, and soon led 2-1 thanks\nto an awesome run by Shipman. In the\nend it was 4-2 to Oxford, but considering the number of freshers and the lack\nof sleep from the night before, it was a\npretty good result. Everyone got showered and changed and then we tried to\nhead off, though there was one detour\nto the hostel to pick up a wallet, and\nthen back to the pitch to pick some left\nkit; freshers, eh? Eventually everyone\ngot home: tired, hungover and broke!\nIt\u2019s been a great season so far for the\n1st XV rugby team and they were eager to maintain their form in their last\naway match in 2007 against University\nof Hertfordshire 1st. Having arrived at\ntheir ground, which also serves as the\nSaracens Academy training facility,\neveryonewantedtoshowwhodeserved\nto be top of the table. Our opponents\nwere also out for revenge, however, after their narrow 20-19 loss at Fortress\nHarlington earlier this term.\nThe wanna-be Saracens players\ndidn\u2019t look so fit during their warm-up, though, and that proved to be detrimental to their game.\nAlthough Imperial dominated from\nthe off, the score didn\u2019t change imme-diately. Imperial got a catch-and-drive\ntry after another amazing line-out but\nthat was about it. Herts fought back\nwith a penalty but that was as close as\nthey could get to Imperial\u2019s try-line.\nThey never looked like pressuring for a\ntry. Then, Flannan O\u2019Mahoney got his\nfirst try of the season on the left-hand\ncorner after some great phases. Alexander Johnstone seemed frightened\nof reaching his 100 point-mark for the\nterm and missed both conversions. Imperial then eased off and didn\u2019t score\nfor the rest of the half.\nThe opponents almost got back into\nthe game with turnovers at rucks and\nmauls but it was great fitness and support play that got Imperial back on the\nscoreboard.\nAlex Johnstone finished off a try under the posts after a great break by Joe\nBrown. The conversion was good and\nthe team then started to put on some\nvery nice attacking rugby. This resulted in another stunning try by James\nFletcher, literally a millimeter away\nfrom the left touch-line after some\ngreat phases. Equally important was a\ndraw pass from Man of the Match Tom\nZeal, who did what he had done the\nwhole game, arriving in support at the\nright time. Another penalty from Alex\nJohnstone brought the final result to\n27-3 and the feeling of a great term for\nImperial 1st XV.\nImperial dominated from the first\nkick-off with a very strong pack and\nexcellent line-outs. In addition, fly-half\nJoe Brown again controlled the game\nremarkably well. The only Herts player\nwho showed a glimpse of what he was\ncapable of was their fly-half but flank-ers Nick Johnstone and James Pettit\nput so much pressure on him that he\ncould never deliver any good balls.\nHowever, the season is far from over,\nand with the upcoming Varsity match\nthere\u2019s still plenty to shoot for.\nRugby 1sts finish\n2007 on a high\nRugby\nHertfordshire Men\u2019s 1st XV 3\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st XV 27\nMax Joachim\nBUSA Rugby Union\nSouth East 1A\nP W D L Diff Pts\n1 Imperial 10 8 0 2 135 24\n2 Brunel 9 6 0 3 63 18\n3 Portsmouth 10 6 0 4 130 18\n4 RUMS 10 5 1 4 7 16\n5 BUCKS 9 4 0 5 -99 12\n6 GKT 9 4 0 5 26 12\n7 Hert\u2019shire 9 3 1 5 -70 10\n8 Middlesex 10 1 0 9 -192 3\n4 parts debauchery, 1 part hockey\nin dreamy Oxfored\n\n"

There will be a new gym on the floor above too\nDuring the final days of last term, the\nUnion announced that it had finally\nsecured funding to proceed with phase\ntwo of the Beit Masterplan redevelopment scheme, following the approval of\na grant from College of \u00a31.93m, bringing the total funds raised to \u00a33.322m.\nThe Beit Masterplan is the Union\u2019s\nmuch needed strategy for rejuvenating\nand updating its current aging facili-ties. The 2nd phase of the Masterplan\naims to update parts of the West side\nof the Union building, upgrade the\nancient electrical and mechanical in-frastructure, and prepare the building\nfor the final phase. Work is planned to\nbegin in March once the current tendering process has been completed\nand it is due to be completed in January 2009.\nThe Student Activities Centre (SAC),\ncurrently located in the East Basement,\nis due to move to the second floor mezzanine of the main Union building. The\nSAC will be completely redesigned to\nbecome a more centralised element of\nthe Union, a hub for all student clubs\nand societies.\nThe third floor will be converted\ninto a brand new gym with a sprung,\nmirrored dance floor replacing the\none currently on the second floor, in\norder to give clubs and societies a flexible space that is free for them to use\n(Ethos charges societies approximately\n\u00a345 per hour to use its facilities). The\nmeeting rooms that are currently on\nthe 3rd floor are planned to move down\ninto the East Basement, occupying the\nspace where the SAC used to be.\nThe gym will be accompanied by\nnew female and male changing rooms\nin the central core of the 3rd and 2nd\nfloor mezzanine, respectively. The\nrenovation of the central core (the\nstairwell and lift) will be completed\nand energy efficiency measures will be\nimplemented throughout the building.\nThe financial support will be coming from a number of sources. College\nhas given the Union a \u00a31.93m grant.\nGrants of \u00a3500k and \u00a3300k have also\ncome from the Harlington and IC\nTrusts, with the remainder to come\nfrom the Union itself. Reclaimed VAT\nfrom phase one makes up \u00a3396k whilst\n\u00a3196k must be taken from the Union\u2019s\nGeneral Reserve.\nAs readers may remember the General Reserve (a large pot of money intended for use in the event of an emer-gency) was discovered to be in great\ndifficulties in the early part of last\nterm, but following a full audit it has\nbeen restored to healthy levels. It currently stands at \u00a31.2m and the planned\nexpenditure of \u00a3196k is considerably\nless than the \u00a3750k+ that the Union\nfeared it may have to spend.\nSpeculation over the progress of\nphase two has been rife for roughly\nnine months after the poor reception\nof phase one which as Felix readers may\nrecall overran and prevented use of the\ncentral core for approximately four\nmonths. Phase one has been dogged by\ncontroversy over its dubious success\neven after doubling its completion time\nwith complaints about the lack of significant change in the central core, and\na lift that often breaks down apparently\ncosting the best part of \u00a31.8m.\nSome of the improvements in phase\ntwo are in preparation for the third\nand final phase, in which it is planned\nto totally renovate daVinci\u2019s and dB\u2019s,\nreplace the old gym with a games\nroom and move the Union offices to\nthe third floor and settle on a use for\nthe space left behind. After the long\nand protracted financial negotiations\nduring the preparation for phase two,\nit remains to be seen when, or if it will\nbegin, who will fund it and how much\nit will actually cost.\nCost: \u00a33.322m\nProject start/finish: March 2008/January 2009\n2nd floor mezzanine changes: New Student Activities Centre, male\nchanging rooms\n3rd floor changes: New gymnasium with sprung, mirrored dance\nfloor\nFurther improvements: New energy efficiency measures, upgraded\nelectrical and mechanical infrastructure\nPhase two at a glance\nOyster + Railcard = \u00a33.10 daily price cap\n\n"

    "content": "I know what you\u2019re thinking right now. Why, oh God, why waste space on a piece\nof detritus like KillZone. Fair point. KillZone was pooptacular. It was shit.\nHowever, KillZone II (or KillZone PS3, whatever makes you happy) wants to be\nthe shit. Shyeah, right. What with Guerilla\u2019s first attempt at a \u201cHalo-slayer\u201d and\nthe CGI debacle of E3\n2005, there\u2019s no way they\u2019re capable of making a decent\ngame.\nOr are they. Guerilla came out of the closet and did the unthinkable and\nshowed off real gameplay footage and video that cheekily included the aforementioned CGI trailer, except, it was actually rendered in real-time. And you\nknow what, it honestly looks good. The gritty, charcoal vibes - one of the few\nhighlights of the original - has been retained. Otherwise, the game is almost\nunrecogniseable. Boasting an all-out assault on all the\nsenses, this revitalised title seems to pull off every\ngraphical trick in the trade. The character models in\nparticular impressed with life-like animations, gestures and facial expressions.\nWhat remains to be seen, though, is the real sub-stance: the gameplay elements. The FPS genre is\none that doesn\u2019t lend itself to much innovation,\nrather relying on finding the \u2018right\u2019 formula and\nbuilding upon it. KillZone, to be brutally honest,\nhad no such formula so it\u2019s interesting to see how\nthe developers will approach their first serious attempt at quality.\nWhat\u2019s included into the mix is a cover system\nthat allows one to latch onto any part of solid scenery and then hide behind it while popping out to risk shots at the enemy. It\u2019s certainly not the newest mechanic around\nbut it does promise to be an entertaining addition that the stellar Call of Duty 4\ndid not possess. There\u2019s a thought.\nPlotwise, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything particularly remarkable of-fered. The ISA (Interplanetary Strategic Alliance) forces have now\nbeen directly landed on Planet Helghan (home of the Helghast)\nin order to take the fight to them. On the way they not only encounter eery-eyed transgressors but also a hostile planet that the\nHelghast seem to be harnessing directly against you. It\u2019s somewhat interesting but I wouldn\u2019t really expect anything particularly\nepic or immersive.\nKillZone II finds itself in an intriguing position. If it can succeed and\nbring forth the solid gameplay and fantastic visuals it promises\nthen it will be a true hit. Otherwise, it stands to flounder and\nsimply die like its predecessor.\nThe previous year\u2019s Games Developers Convention\nin San Francisco witnessed the birth of something\nspecial by newly founded British games studio,\nMedia Molecule. This something is LittleBigPlanet,\nthe first truly co-operative multi-player platform\ngame that could be the first jewel set into Sony\u2019s\nPS3 crown.\nThe characters of the game are a set of player-controlled plush toys traversing a human-sized environment pushing the PlayStation into an area of the market ruthlessly defended by Nintendo, that is aptly dubbed\n\u201cnon-gamers\u201d and young ones. This could be seen as a\nrisk but it could bring variety to a much neglected area\nof this platform\u2019s library sparsely populated by games like\nRatatouille, another great game overlooked by the majority.\nAlthough the content of the game would insinuate its target audience to be the\nyoung, the challenges still provide a high level of entertainment to force the traditional gamer into finding solutions to non-traditional problems ala Portal.\nPlayers are encouraged to create their own levels and craft their own puzzles from\nthe game\u2019s expansive library of obstances. This game isn\u2019t oriented for the lone gamer\neither: it\u2019s objective is to bring together a group of challengers and get them to collaborate\nto complete greater achievements than a mere individual could accomplish. Some sections of the game actually require multiple players as a single player often cannot do what\u2019s\nrequired.\nFrom a technical aspect the beauty of the game is an astounding step towards Sony\u2019s vi-sion. It utilises the PlayStation\u2019s\nhuge potential for physics to\nmake the challenges that face the\nplayers far more dynamic and\nformidable.\nThe first public demo is planned\nto appear on the PlayStation Network sometime during the year\nand the full game should be released towards the holiday sea-son, but the question stands: will\nthis be the PlayStation 3\u2019s killer\napp?\nGuns. Swords. Two guys bedecked in tight leather. Need any more innuendo?\nCapcom\u2019s intensely stylish Devil May Cry makes a triumphant return. DMC4 is set some years\nafter the events of the original DMC, which saw the spunky rockstar of gaming, Dante, send the\nDevil bawling back to Hell yet again. However, he concedes his status this time to one Nero.\nDante\u2019s father, the Legendary Dark Knight Sparda, originally fought against the Devil. It turns out\nthat this little action earned him quite a few fanboys. The game will start off presenting this group as\nthe Order of the Sword, with Nero as one of its members. Although, his presence as part of the cult\nseems more driven by his affection for a girl named Kyrie. During a sermon by the Order, the peace\nis suddenly disrupted by the appearance of a stranger coiffed with silver locks and enshrouded in a\nblood-red trench coat. He wastes no time in slaughtering the priests. Thus begins DMC4.\nBesides the romantic connotations of the plot and Dante\u2019s shocking actions, what really matters is the gameplay. And this game seems to deliver. Combining fast-paced, frenetic swordplay\nwith a staccato of gun attacks, DMC meshes together proximal and distance combat rather de-liciously. Nero introduces a new mechanic: the Devil Bringer. His right arm happens\nto be possessed by a demon of sorts and he can use its power into\na powerful ectoplasmic manifestation that allows\nhim to perform all sorts of insane tricks. He\u2019ll need\nall the help he can get as the Order members seem\nto have ulterior motives. And he won\u2019t be alone:\nDante is there to guide him.\nAugmented by some absolutely stunning\nart and visuals, DMC4\npromises to be the\nballs-out action\nevent of the\nyear.\nWaiting isn\u2019t usually the most fun of\nactivities, but sometimes that little\nbit of patience can lead to something special. Metal Gear Solid 4\nis poised to be such an event.\nPurportedly the last of the great\nMGS series and personally, the\ngame I\u2019ve been waiting for (since\nthe last one, of course), MGS4 embodies expectations that are interstellar in proportion and not just from\nan avid fanbase as well. Sony have yet to release\ntheir own magnum opus and there are doubts that\nthey are capable of such. Thus, it falls on Snake\u2019s aging shoulders to bear the burden of not only a world\nravaged by war but yet another one full of hope.\nYears after the chilling events onboard Arsenal Gear, everything has\nchanged. War has been transformed into a profitable business, one\nwhere soldiers find a constant home. However, this vision of a warriors\u2019 sanctuary has been hollowed and debauched by Snake\u2019s twin\nbrother, Liquid Snake. If he isn\u2019t stopped, the entire planet will slowly\nbe reduced to naught but blood, rubble and distant memories.\nThe premise is definitely far more grim that in any Metal Gear in that the scale\nof the status quo is significantly larger. Similarly, the gameplay must progress to\ncompensate.\nThe traditional stealth gameplay that MGS pioneered has now been augmented\nand prepared to enter a modern era of combat where there is no place to hide.\nDemos reveal the core gameplay to be unchanged but with myriad additions in\norder to streamline it. The introduction of the OctoCam means that Snake can\nblend into any environment (like a chameleon); context-sensitive actions offer\nthe ability to interact more with a malleable, spontaneous environment. The\npromise of a more organic CQC (Close Quarters Combat) techniques and an\nenhanced roster of weaponry is fervently anticipated in equal measure.\nMetal Gear has always been about an astounding, immersive and yes, rather\nabstruse, narrative and this game will probably be no different. With multiple\nthreads coalescing to an ultimate purpose and old faces returning for the last\ngreat adventure, MGS4 promises to be an emotional journey for the ages.\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n27\nFriday 11 January 2008 felix\nGames\nLITTLEBIGPLANET DEVELOPER MEDIA MOLECULE PUBLISHER SONY\nMETAL GEAR SOLID 4: GUNS OF THE PATRIOTS\nDEVELOPER KONAMI PUBLISHER KONAMI\nDEVIL MAY CRY 4 DEVELOPER CAPCOM PUBLISHER CAPCOM KILLZONE II DEVELOPER GUERILLA STUDIOS PUBLISHER SONY\nInsert a random Queer Eye for the Straight Guy reference... it\u2019s begging for one!\n\n"

    "content": "8 felix Friday 11 January 2008\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment\nIt feels good to be back\nA\nh, it\u2019s so good to be back;\nand how nice to see you\nall again. Please, please,\nhave a seat, take a load\noff, make yourselves\nmore comfortable. Now can I get you\nanything, anything at all? May I suggest\nthe 2008? It looks set to be a good year,\na little bit delicate around the edges,\nperhaps, but with a strong body and a\nsmooth yet delightfully fleshy texture.\nIt\u2019s very popular at the moment, and\nlooks set to rival some of the great vintages of recent years.\nI\u2019d heartily recommend it with an Olympiad \u00e0 la Pekinois with its Do-Ping\nsauce, the highlight of our summer\nmenu. You could, of course, always try\nthe prime cut 12-ounce American Election; which I think deserves to be well-done, for a change. Perhaps you would\nprefer something a little less common?\nSomething more suited to the refined\npalate? A highlight of our winter menu\nis the spicy South Asian or Pakistani\nchicken, so tender and so well-cooked\nthat it literally falls to pieces.\nPerhaps I could tempt you with a\nCreationist hotpot? A delightful mishmash of lightly battered arguments,\ncooked evidence and half-baked conjectures covered with a savoury puff\npastry filled with hot air. Delicious\nwith a pinch of salt. No? Quite frankly\nI don\u2019t blame you \u2013 rather too difficult\nto swallow.\nMaybe I could interest you with a\nstarter, then? One of the old favourites\nis the Middle Eastern soup; especially\npopular at this time of year, it\u2019s a dense,\nmurky and nutritious mix exploding\nwith flavour. It\u2019s been a classic for so\nlong that I really can\u2019t see it ever falling\nfrom the public eye. If you\u2019re looking\nfor something a little lighter, perhaps\nI could suggest our signature salad:\nthe \u201cPutin\u201d, a Caesar with Russian\ndressing?\nA new addition to our menu is the\nLHC alphabet soup, with a rich helping of elementary particles cooked at\nhigh temperatures on the side. For an\nadditional 1.7 billion Euros, the chef\nwill garnish it with a delicate Higgs Boson gratin. I would advise that particular item for the more educated palate,\nthough I\u2019m sure anyone could feel its\nbenefits.\nHow about a dessert? I\u2019m afraid that\nthe choice of sweets we offer is a little\nbit uncertain, due to creative differences in the kitchen. At the moment there\nis a small misunderstanding between\nour pastry chef and our sommelier as\nto whether or not a Bombe Surprise\nwould set the tone for the new 2008.\nWe might, however, have a baked\nAlaska ready for you sometime this\nyear, though the chefs seem to be in\ndisagreement as to how realistic a\nprediction that is. So I would advise\nagainst making preparations for such\nan eventuality, although anything could\nhappen \u2013 I\u2019m not a cuisine sceptic, you\nknow, far from it.\nWould you care for a hot drink? No?\nMaybe a soft drink, then \u2013 a glass of\nAfghani Coke? How about some fresh,\nclear sub-Saharan water? No? Nothing\nat all? Are you quite sure? Absolutely\npositive? All right then, I\u2019ll leave you to\nkeep reading your paper in peace. Just\nallow me to wish you a Happy New\nYear, compliments of the chef \u2013 the\nvery least we could do for our regular\ncustomers.\nSomething to look forward to in \u201808: The US circus, I mean, elections\nGilead Amit\nA\nmerica is going to change\nhands this year, and after\neight fucking years the\nonly thing people can\nmuster is more Bush\njokes. More of them. Hundreds of the\nfuckers, like it\u2019s an End Of Line sale at\nHarrods\u2019 Old Internet Jokes depart-ment. George Bush became President\nof the United States before I could fac-torise quadratics \u2013 he represents my\nentire memory of American governmental policy. He has defined a huge\nchapter in our teenage and not-so-teenage years, and the best most of you\ncan manage is to jeer and spit at both\nhim and those contending to replace\nhim. It really is a case of same shit, different year, isn\u2019t it?\nThis year, America will choose someone else. That\u2019s big, to me. That\u2019s probably the biggest event of 2008 right\nthere, no matter what else might happen in the next twelve months. What\nI\u2019m sure is going to happen is that the\npapers are going to demand something\nof the American people, they\u2019re going\nto use History as a personified noun\nand make allusions to it being the \u2018last\nchance\u2019 and maybe include a photo of\na sad child in front of an American flag\nfor good measure.\nAnd that\u2019s fine, because everyone\nknows that people who write comment\ncolumns are idiots who get enjoyment\nout of displaying their genitalia via\nthe medium of the English language.\nPerhaps, in fact, you\u2019re with them in\nstanding behind the rippling stars-and-stripes, a single tear rolling down\nyour cheek as you look up and slightly\nto the left as Frank Sinatra crackles in\nthe background \u2013 Oh beautiful, for\nspacious skies\u2026\nGive me a break. America doesn\u2019t\nneed your condescending banter and it\nsure as shit doesn\u2019t need you spitting on\nthe mistakes of their leaders. If there\u2019s\none thing it could do with \u2013 it and the\nrest of this planet\u2019s population \u2013 is for\nthis green and pleasant land to get on\nwith life. Because while everyone the\nworld over gawps at a black man and\na bigot banging their heads together\non soapboxes, and news agencies from\nhere to Shanghai drone on for hours\nabout the fecklessness of the American\npeople and the hypocrisy of their for-LOL Bush. Am I right folks?\nA. Geek\neign policy, no-one at all mentions us.\nNot a single, solitary peep.\nIn 1957 a whole bunch of countries\nthought it would be a fine idea to band\ntogether and be a bit jollier with each\nother than they had been previously.\nAlthough since meetings before then\nhad largely involved chlorine gas and\ngenocide, the bar was set fairly low, and\nthe fact that it had taken them nearly\ntwo centuries to realise that America\nhad the right idea all along wasn\u2019t a\ngreat indicator of intelligence either.\nNevertheless, the foundations for the\nEuropean Union were laid, with a mere\nsix countries on the member list. Fifty\nyears on, and like a primary school\ncraze it\u2019s gone from an elite clique of\nthe cool and revolutionary to being a\nreally rubbish distraction that everyone\u2019s gotten a bit bored of and is only\nexciting to the social outcasts that just\nfigured out how it works.\nI confess I\u2019m not a huge fan of Europe\n\u2013 I\u2019m English, and so at some level I\nhate any country whose language has\nmale and female nouns. But since, ap-parently, the world is on the verge of\ncollapse, I thought the idea was to do\nthe honourable, Hollywood-disastermovie thing and band together to fight\nthe forthcoming Armageddon. Possibly with Bruce Willis playing the part\nof Gordon Brown.\nIn its place we have two groups of\nidiots \u2013 the \u2018Euro Sceptics\u2019 that make\nthe BNP look well thought-out and organised by comparison, and the \u2018Euro\nManiacs\u2019 who spend their days calming\ndown the French and practicing being\nanal.\nI mean, sure \u2013 America invaded\nIraq, refused to sign the Kyoto agreement and threatened to abduct British citizens without due process. But\nat least they did something. Can you\nimagine the EU invading somewhere?\nAlthough, to their credit, the EU are\nfairly useless when it comes to getting\ntreaties signed, too. We wouldn\u2019t know\norganisation if it led us into the House\nof Commons and gave us an enema\nwith a short length of hosepipe and\nsome sulphuric acid.\nIgnoring Goldman Sachs\u2019 list of rising countries, there are three major superpowers ready to rise and the United\nStates doesn\u2019t show any sign of slowing\ndown either. Yet in Europe, we seem to\nbe quietly bemused, like the one guy\nin your Year 11 class who didn\u2019t have\nthe internet and didn\u2019t really get what\nthe fuss was about. Maybe if we ignore\nworld events they\u2019ll sort of go away\nand we can return to the age of colonies and orgies.\nWell, we can\u2019t. It\u2019s 2008 and it\u2019s time\nto bloody get on with it. Who cares if\nyou want the single currency? Does\nit really matter if Turkey isn\u2019t part of\nEurope? Are hard-working and enthusiastic migrants really that much of a\nburden? It\u2019s time to ignore the minor\nissues, because quite frankly we don\u2019t\nhave the luxury of being picky any\nmore. In the disaster movie, we\u2019re approaching that fateful scene where the\nboring and expendable characters are\nviolently killed off and if we don\u2019t do\nsomething about it it\u2019s going to be us.\nSo whether you\u2019re a supporter or\nnot, at least voice your opinion this\nyear. At least try to push the debate,\nto force some progress. 2008 could be\nyour last chance. It could be the year\nHistory judges us by. All together now,\nGod save our gracious Queen\u2026\nIt\u2019s official. Bush jokes are no longer funny. So behave\n\u201c\nI confess\nI\u2019m not a huge\nfan of Europe \u2013\nI\u2019m English, and\nso I hate any\ncountry whose\nlanguage has\nmale and female\nnouns\n\n"

A false crisis due to amnesia\nGame on, 2008! Game on!\nW\nell, hello everyone!\nI suppose coming back after two\nweeks of luxurious\nindulgence only to\nbe thrust into a horrid whirlpool of exams and deadlines can\u2019t be the nicest\nthing. It sucks, no?\nWorry not stalwart readers for we\nare here to ease your suffering. So pick\nup this issue of Felix and indulge in our\nGames section. Starting from a retrop-erspective of 2007 in terms of gaming\nto the Holiday releases to the upcoming titles of 2008, Felix Games takes a\ncomprehensive look at the stuff you\nlove. And the best part is that it\u2019s written for you, by you!\nI do remember mentioning a new\nconcept for Felix Games and suffice it\nto say it\u2019s still work-in-progress but we\nhope you\u2019ll like it when it actually sees\nthe light of day.\nThis is poised to be quite an interesting year for games particularly since it\nhas to live upto the astonishing brilliance of 2007 - an epochal 365 days\nthat gave us more fun than we\u2019d dare\nhope for.\nI\u2019d also like to take this opportunity to\ngive a heads up to an all-new tech section headed by my good friend James\nFinnerty. Tech and games go hand-in-hand so we hope to satiate your cravings with atleast a few collaborations\nthis year. Interestingly, they look at the\ninnards of the magical, wondrous WiiMote. It\u2019s really quite clever how the\nlittle thing works.\nAnyway, allow me to explain how this\nissue works. It\u2019s been done in the form\nof spreads for each console (the PS3,\nXbox 360 and PC - unfortunately, Wii\nsubmissions were nil, but we\u2019ll work on\nthat soon enough!). On the left-hand\nside you\u2019ll get to read reviews of the\ngames that wowed us during the cold\nwinter months and kept us engrossed\nwhen we were supposed to be revising.\nSimilarly, the right-hand side showcases previews of upcoming games that\nwe think sound brilliant and will try\nour very best to report on and cover\nonce they get released.\nIt may be slightly confusing graphi-cally, but it\u2019s been done deliberately to\ncreate themes that are endemic and\nindicative of the relevant gaming con-sole. We\u2019d definitely love your comments since a lot of hours were put into\nthis issue.\nSpeaking of comments, the Reader\nRiposte section should be back in full\nswing once we resume normal serv-ice. So we definitely want to hear your\ncomments (in 50 words or less) on the\ngamesthatwe\u2019rereviewinginthisissue.\nSimilarly, I\u2019d like to call out to those interested in writing for Felix Games but\nwere somewhat hesitant about start-ing. My advice: don\u2019t be. Submit your\nwork and start getting involved at the\nfantastic world of Felix! Go on, warm\nup MS Word - you know you want to!\nPlease do send in your comments,\nopinions, criticism and all other game-related pieces to games.felix@imperial.\nac.uk.\nAzfarul Islam would like to welcome you all to another year of gala gaming\nG\nreetings all! 2007 had\nbeenquiteayearfor those\nwho call\ngaming\nnot just\na hobby but a passion.\nIt was a melange of\nboth good, bad and\ndownright outrageous\nnews and events. Let\u2019s\ntake the quickest of recaps before reviewing\nthe best of the 2007\nWinter holiday season\nand then looking towards the games that\nwill carry us through\nthe year 2008.\nThe earlier quarter\nwas defined by the\nrelease of Sony\u2019s PlayStation 3 - an obsidian\nbehemoth of a console\nthat was really too expensive for its worth.\nDespite that, it was\na portentous event meaning that all\nthree new consoles had finally graced\nBritish soil and the competition here\nhad truly begun.\nAround May, the newly revamped\nE3\nwas observed. Moving away from\nthe smoke-and-mirrors glitz of the E3s\npast, it had become a subdued seminar\nof sorts being held at posh hotels.\nIn other, more terrestrial news, uber\nretailer Game announced that they\nwould be absorbing GameStation into\ntheir bloated bulk. What this means\nfor gamers is that a retail monopoly is\non the verge of being created and this\ncan hurt us financially. Nasty.\nRockstar\u2019s tango with controversy\ncontinued with its utterly immoral\nManhunt 2 being subject\nto the ultimate ban-ham-mer. However, Rockstar\ndecided to fight it out,\nculminating in a cat-and-mouse game where\nvictory\nwas short-lived as\nthe case\nwas finally\nreferred to\nthe High\nCourt\nwith a decision still\npending.\nGaming was\nbrought\nup by politicians as\nwell with\nDavid\nCameron citing videogames as one of the reasons for a degenerating\nyouth culture. Gordon\nBrown mentioned interactive media but in\na far more diplomatic light explaining\nthat regulations over adult material\nneeded to be refined.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that gaming is finally emerging into the limelight as\na premier and mainstream form of\nmedia. 2007 witnessed a cavalcade of\nwatershed releases ranging from the\nsurprisingly fantastic to the fervently\nanticipated.\nThe year was marked by the release\nof hyped megahits such as God of War\nII, Halo 3, Super Mario Galaxy, Call of\nDuty 4, Unreal Tournament III, Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars\nand Guitar Hero 3. And this was pretty\nmuch the tip of the veritable iceberg.\nThere was a broad spectrum of quality and\nvariety\nall across\nthe console smor-gasbord.\nNames like\nPortal, BioShock,\nSupreme\nCommander,\nRock\nBand,\nMass Effect\nand Super Paper\nMario have\nnow been\njuxtaposed\nwith ingenuity and\ninnovation.\nTo be fair,\nit\u2019s almost nigh on impossible to na-mecheck the sheer quantity of quality\nlast year but rest assured, it was a Very\nGood Year for GamingTM\n.\n2008 promises to be a quieter year,\ncharacterised by the presence of a\nmore genuine gaming fanbase over a\nmainstream one. The emphasis now\nfalls on the PlayStation 3 to truly rise\nup to the challenge of making good on\nthe promise of such powerful hardware\ncapabilities. Titles like Metal Gear\nSolid 4, LittleBigPlanet, Final Fantasy\nXIII, Gran Turismo 5 and Devil May\nCry 4 offer what the PlayStation does\nbest: a fantastic concoction of variety\nand quality.\nOn top of all this, the release of the\ngargantuan Grand Theft Auto IV\nlooms with expectation and unfettered\nhype.\nDespite what seems to have been the\nrelease of all their key franchise titles,\nthe Xbox 360 and Wii also have much\nlife left in\nthem and\nit\u2019ll be interesting\nto watch\ndevelopers attempt to\ninnovate as opposed to\nrehash.\nThat\u2019s it really, in a\ntiny nutshell. We at Felix hope to be be there with you as 2008\ncontinues forth and we hope you enjoy\nthe journey as much as we expect to. A\nbelated Happy New Year to all!\nHere are the names of all who made this issue possible!\nIn alphabetical order:\nAndrew Lim\nCall of Duty 4: Modern\nWarfare\nAlex Stubley\nNinja Gaiden II\nAzfarul Islam\nLayout and Design\nRatchet & Clank: Tools of\nDestruction\nUncharted: Drake\u2019s Fortune\nMetal Gear Solid 4: Guns of\nthe Patriots\nDevil May Cry 4\nKillZone II\nAssassin\u2019s Creed\nSplinter Cell: Conviction\nToo Human\nFable 2\nChris Hutchison\nGuitar Hero III\nDavid Lawrence\nUnreal Tournament III\nJames Finnerty\nLittleBigPlanet\nCrysis\nSamir Talwar\nSpore\nSebastian Nordgren\nThe Witcher\nViral Shah\nMass Effect\nWing Hym Liu\nStarCraft II\nA gigantic thanks\ngo out to everyone\nwho pulled together and contributed\nall those awesome\npieces.\nA few of you did so\nat very short notice\nand for that, I\u2019m\neternally grateful!\nAz\n\n"

And while\nI commend his conservation work with bunnies and his regular\nvisits to see deprived orphans, it seems\nthat someone truly deserving has been\noverlooked in the selection process. I\nfeel it\u2019s my duty to give him his due,\nladies and gentlemen Chef\u2026 urh\u2026\nPresident Pervez Musharraf.\nIn 1999 he became leader of Pakistan\nthrough a supposed coup d\u2019etat, but\nin reality Musharraf, rather like President Bush, found himself in a job that\nhe wasn\u2019t qualified for. He was a military chef, assigned to work for Prime\nMinister Nawaz Sharif and at the time\nof the coup d\u2019etat was on an unofficial holiday in Java. Desperate not be\ndiscovered off duty he rushed back to\nPakistan and through an unfortunate\nset of circumstances involving a bowl\nof hot soup and Kylie Minogue, found\nhimself at the head of the military\ncoup. By no means a power-hungry\nmaniac, Musharraf spends most of his\ntime annoyed that running the country\nconstantly eats into his kitchen time.\nHe remembers better times when all\nhe had to do was cook and try to ignore\nthe monotonous good governance by\nplaying practical jokes on the other\ngenerals, like putting too much sugar\nin their tea. The President sometimes\nwonders if they don\u2019t grow suspicious\nat the growing incidence of diabetes\namongst high-ranking generals.\nIt is no secret that Musharraf has\nbeen an enemy of Islamic extremists\nand that in this respect he has been a\nvaluable ally of the West. This can be\ntraced back to 1990 when his former\nboss Nawaz Sharif met with Osama bin\nLaden. Musharraf was given the honour of cooking for the gathering. Apparently bin Laden described the goat\nserved at the meeting as \u201csalty\u201d. Musharraf has not forgotten this stinging\nbarb and has tried to protect Pakistan\nfrom these culinary philistines.\nWhile he may appear a calculating\nindividual, manipulating events to his\nPerson of the year: Guess who\nSamuel Black\nNew year\u2019s resolution: a haircut\nI\nwas miffed by the news from December\u2019s climate change conference in Bali that carbon credits\nfrom \u2018avoided deforestation\u2019 will\nbecome eligible under the Kyoto\nprotocol. No longer was this chance\nto save wildlife, carbon and money all\ntogether just my little project, because\nthe grown-ups understood too. I automatically began to convince myself\nthat Bali was clearly too little too late,\nand was seriously upgrading the demands I wanted to lay before humanity\nwhen it struck me: I am a ninny. And\nyou are too.\nWe are like Kevin and Perry (who\nwent large), you and I, when we insist\nthat the world is a terrible and doomed\nplace. It\u2019s always adolescents locked in\ntheir own rooms that think that only\nthey can see the big picture. The Kevins\ninside us are saying that progress in\nBali is not enough, but Kevin cannot\nsee past his own fringe. This is because\nhis beliefs are actually just expressions\nof psychological, hormone-dependent\nneed. Reason following passion. The\ndeconstruction is slightly disconcert-ing, but worthwhile, because what is\nthe opposing view to teenage discon-tent? It is the view presumably held by\nthe heroes of that fantastic film, Mr\nand Mrs Patterson, Kevin\u2019s parents\n(who are seen gloriously copulating on\na big screen in Manumission).\nThis view is optimism about the future of humanity, and of course there\u2019s\nlittle point caring about the environment if you aren\u2019t fundamentally op-timistic. This implies a belief that as\nscience divests the world of its magic,\nand as we come to a better understanding of our mind, we don\u2019t expect to diminish the quality of life. I agree, very\nlittle can diminish the wonder of Jessica Alba\u2019s posterior; certainly not the\nscientific fact that it is perfect, with a\nwaist to hip ratio of 0.69. If you are\nstriving for future people to be okay,\nthen why not be okay today yourself?\nBecause it\u2019s not so bad. I awoke to\nGordon Brown\u2019s appearance on the\nToday programme this morning, and\nhe was so very irritating it helped me\nget out of bed! I turned off the radio\nimmediately, by which stage he had\nstressed seventy times that he had to\nmake \u201ctough choices\u201d. But I\u2019m not\nworried, because he will choose badly,\nand will be replaced by a man with very\nclear skin, who realises that I don\u2019t understand why everything in this country except the fox is allowed to go to the\ndogs, but is decent enough to arrange a\nphoto opportunity demonstrating that\nhe does understand, and doesn\u2019t like it\neither. And I saw another photograph,\nof Nicolas Sarkozy wearing silver avia-tors. Brilliant!\nAll I\u2019m saying is, try being content\nfor a change. Don\u2019t make a solo charge\non a machine-gun post when your\ncomrades in arms are back in Blighty,\nlying in the long grass by the river sipping ginger beer and rolling around\nin haystacks with Mary-Lou from the\nfarm. Get back on the landing craft\nand go for a potter around the harbour,\nbecause the sun\u2019s out. And get a hair\ncut.\nFatness\nown ends, he is in fact much more\ndown to earth. When asked to allow\nfree and fair elections he usually replies by asking for the salt.\nHis suspension of the Pakistani constitution last year had little to do with\nMachiavellian manoeuvrings; rather\nhe had mistakenly swapped it for the\nrecipe to his apple stew. He feared\nthat if he allowed normal public life\nto continue someone might notice\nthat the right to public assembly had\nsuddenly become the right to simmer\nfor 20 minutes. It was only when the\nSupreme Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry,\ninsulted his souffl\u00e9 that Musharraf\ngot mad and undermined the judicial\nsystem, but give the man a break. He\nspent hours on that souffl\u00e9.\nPresident Musharraf has not been\nafraid to fight extremists in Pakistan\nand for this, as well as his delicious\nchicken jalfrezi, he should be com-mended. Admittedly he has tried only\nhalf-heartedly to bring democracy to\nPakistan, but for a man whose primary\nskill is chopping carrots, he hasn\u2019t done\nall that badly. If this doesn\u2019t convince\nyou then just remember that without\nMusharraf, my Person of the Year for\n2007, you wouldn\u2019t be able to get decent naan bread this side of the Radcliffe line.\nS\no I\u2019ve been told my last article\nwas \u2018controversial\u2019. Because\neveryone knows whenever\nsomeone says one of those\nevil four letter words a fairy\ndies. Well fuck. I was never a big fan\nof fairies anyway, so I don\u2019t really care\nmuch if Peter Pan loses his Tinkerbell.\nI\u2019m pretty sure those kids would\u2019ve\nstarted experimenting with that faerie\ndust after they got into high school.\nFor the PC police: I\u2019m not going to\nshove garden rakes up your ass. Not\neven if you say please. This is a university where the union toilets have vending machines that sell sex toys; use one\nof those. Also, I only have one rake and\nI need it to scoop up leaves.\nOnto the article: Fat people (mor-bidly obese in PC, though I don\u2019t know\nwhy you\u2019re still reading since I won\u2019t be\ntranslating everything). They\u2019re easy\nto make fun of, and you know you\u2019re\nrelatively safe because unless you get\ncornered you can always outwalk them\nif they try to sit on you. Britain is supposedly so full of lard by now that the\ntube should be full of it; filling up two\nseats with the armrest comfortably\nwedged somewhere far up between\nthe two halves of their asscheeks. Yet\nwhen I finish the sudoku in my free paper and look around, I don\u2019t find myself swimming in fat folds. My powers\nof deduction thus tell me that either\nthe ones skewing the data are all too\nhuge to get out of their homes or we\u2019re\nbeing lied to.\nOf course there are still some reading Heat magazine and wearing loose\nblack clothes to try and hide their love\nhandles, but it\u2019s hardly a crisis (btw \u2013\nblack really stops being slimming when\nwaist circumference > chest circumfer-ence). There are two opposing views\nregarding the issue. On one hand, it\u2019s\nthe latest fashionable epidemic for\npoliticians (and Jamie Oliver) to worry\nabout, how in evolutionary terms our\nblood is slowly turning into gravy and\nour shadows start gaining mass. On\nthe other side of the equation there are\ndoctors and feminists slating size zero\nmodels on the catwalk. These mixed\nmessages of which way your curves\nshould go is probably the cause of bad\nthings in the world such as bird flu and\nthe credit crunch.\nStick-thin models really do take the\npiss, though, living off a diet of 3 lettuce\nleaves and half a carrot a day. That\u2019s\nless than what a starving African orphan gets. And even then their meal is\nsupplemented by a glass of milk from\nan Oxfam goat. The fashion industry is\nall fucked up. We should boycott them\nby burning all our clothes to speed up\nglobal warming to make it hot enough\nfor everyone to walk around naked.\nI understand your fear that humans\nwill go the way of the Morlocks and\nthe Eloi, turning into a population of\nfatties and thinnies. But worry not,\nfor at some point fat men will neither\nbe able to fish their genitals from between their fatfolds nor be able to tell\nwhether it\u2019s thick thighs or vagina\nthey\u2019re humping. And the stick women won\u2019t want to get preggers because\nit\u2019d ruin their perfect body. Eventually\nboth extremes would hit an evolutionary dead end and die out, leaving only\nChinese and Indians to overpopulate\nthe world.\nNow go vote me as year rep; I\u2019m\nfriendly and approachable.\nDo fat people really exist or did Jamie Oliver just make them up?\nNoel Forrest\nJames Wang\n\n"
