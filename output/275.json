The Committee have located two\npianos for the piano smashing and a source for some of\nthe crockery needed for the\nplate bashing stall, but help\nwill be needed to collect these\nthings and the assistance\nneeded on the day of the\nfe te will be quite substantial.\nLooking forward to next\nyear, the Committee have\nproposed many ideas about\nthe form the Carnival appeal\nshould take, including the\nidea that it should be divided\ninto three periods: a collecting week, a stunts week and\nsomething similar to next\nterm's Arts Festival.\nMuch of the discussion has\ncentred, however, on the\nfailures of this year and what\njobs will need to be done to\navoid the mistakes of this\nyear. The three major posts\nwill again be co-or d in at or,( secretary and junior tre as lure r. The co-or d in at or is\nelected by the Carnival Board\nwhich consists of all the\nUnion Presidents and the\nvice-president and secretary\nof ICU. All nominations for\nthis position should be sent\nto the secretary of ICU with\none proposer and five\nsecond ers, all members of the\nUnion, not later than Monday 28th April.\nAfter this, the co-or d in at or will be free to choose his\ncommittee and sub-commit-tees. These will total something in the region of 60\npeople. In the past, Carnival\ncommittees have suffered\nfrom being 'clique y'. This\nwas unavoidable, since the\nco-or d in at or did not have\nenough time to wander\nthrough the college looking\nfor likely people and was thus\nobliged to choose those he\nknew and could rely on. It is\nhoped that it will be possible\nto prevent this for next year\nby advertising the posts now.\nThe committee posts will\nbe secretary, junior treasurer,\nraffle organiser, concert or-gan is er, Carnival Queen competition organiser, a stunts\norganiser, the fe te organiser,\na public relations officer to\ndeal with all aspects of Carnival outside College, the Arts\nFestival organiser, a publicity\nofficer and a Carnival publications officer to co-ordinate\nthe production of magazines,\nrecords and so on. Apart\nfrom these, the three constituent College vice - presidents sit on the committee\nand it is suggested that there\nshould be an ICWA rep (pre-fer ably the President) or\nFELIX rep and a rep from\nEnts. Any external colleges\njoining our rag would also be\ninvited to appoint officers to\nthe committee. This would\nmake the committee about 20\nstrong.\nThere is no point in pretending that these jobs will\nnot require a lot of work,\nalthough it is hoped that it\nwill not reach the proportions\nthat this year's committee\nsuffered. Ian la rvis feels,\nhowever, that from experience say that the jobs are\nextremely rewarding. The\namount of work they require\nwill depend entirely on the\namount of assistance the\nofficers receive. The majority\nof them will need to form\ntheir own sub-committees.\nThe 'fringe' jobs will include\nsomeone to keep tabs on collecting tins and money s, sales\norganisers for the raffles, a dozen 'Ents - minded' people\nto help with the concert(s), an enthusiastic group to help\nwith the organisation of\nstunts and possibly most important of all someone to\nhandle publicity in each of\nthe clearly defined events\u2014\nfe te, Carnival Queen competition and so on.\nThe publications officer's job will mostly be to keep\ntabs on what's going on with\nthe items being produced. It\nis felt essential that next\nyear a magazine should be\nproduced and, if at all pos-sib le,a record as well. Both\nthese will require a fairly\ndedicated and imaginative\ngroup to make good use of\nthem.\nIan Jarvis feels there is no\nreason at all why anyone involved in Carnival should\nhave so much work to do\nthat he becomes disenchanted\nor fails his exams. If all the\njobs outlined above are filled,\neveryone will have plenty of\ntime to make a tremendous\nsuccess of his particular\nevent, enjoy it and have the\nsatisfaction of being part of\nthe most successful Carnival\nthis College has ever s pen. No\nmatter how little or how\nmuch someone wants to do,\nthere is a job on Carnival for\nhim.\nIf you would like to help\nnext year, you are asked to\ndrop a note into the Carnival\nOffice as soon as possible,\nletting the Committee know\nwhat particular field you are\ninterested in.\nN.B. Don't forget the fe te on May 10th.( Rumour has it\nthere may be a white slave\nmarket!)\nNon-Technical Studies\nFor a number of years,\nsome engineers in the college\nhave been able to study nontechnical subjects as part of\ntheir degree. A survey held\nthis term also revealed a considerable demand in R.C.S. for the introduction of subsidiary courses in the human-i ties, social sciences and\nlanguages.\nFollowing an initiative\nfrom the College Committee\nfor Sociological Studies, on\nwhich the academic affairs\nrepresentatives of the three\nconstituent colleges sit, a questionnaire has been circulated to quantify the\ndemand throughout I.C. for\ncourses of this nature, with a view to establishing them as\noptions (carrying degree\ncredit if necessary). The\nacademic affairs representatives, Jon Shields, Graham\nBurton and Barry Hood, are\nappealing for the questionnaires to be completed and\nreturned as soon as possible.\nCopies of the questionnaire\nare still available and the\nresults will be out very\nshortly.\nChanges at the top\nWith the publication of\nthis issue, we pass a milestone in the history of jour-nal is m. Paul Heath, editor of\nFELIX since last October,\nends his dynamic career as a student journalist and retires\nto the innermost depths of\nBe it Hall to start his\nacademic career free from the\nartificial melee of student\npolitics. His brief, but\nglorious, reign at the pinnacle of the communication\nmedia has turned him into a chain - smoking, alcoholic,\nnervous wreck.\nTo succeed him, in the\nsummer term we have the\nvolatile Les Ebdon, one of\nthe few remaining hot gospel-ling revolutionaries of the\nnon-conformist Middle Ages\nrevolt against the Pope. Next\nAutumn we see the beginning\nof Malcolm Williamson's editorship. Up to now a little\ncog in a big machine, 'ego\ntrip', as he is known to his\nfew remaining friends, can\nbe expected to . . . .\nThey Jell by Les Ebdon\nMe... The season of elections is already upon us and Mines\nand RCS have now elected Presidents for next session. The\nRCS election being by general Union ballot will interest those\nstudying form for the ICU Presidential election (provided of\ncourse there are no shocks at the first Union meeting of next\nterm). The old maxim that a candidate must carry his own\ndepartment was seen in operation once again. Chris Kent's large defeat was inevitable from the day that early canvass\nreturns showed he had little support in his own Mathematics\ndepartment. It would appear that there was an anti-vote\nagainst Kent as John Butterworth collected 64 Maths votes\nto beat Kent's57. Butty took Zoology overwhelmingly by\n35 votes to nil. Botany and Silwood Park also backed Butty\nstrongly. The vital Physios vote split 3 to 1 in favour of Butty\nand Chemistry 2 to 1.\nThe Vice-Presidential elections are of more interest to\nthe budding psychologists because of the closeness of the vote.\nSteve Morrisby in fact won all the departments except Physics.\nHowever his failure to mobil is e grass-roots support in\nChemistry, where he beat Barry Pywell by 87 votes to 24 on\na low poll meant that he lost the election when Pywell\nromped home in Physics with 185 votes against 41 for\nMorrisby.\nA point which might interest potential ICU Secretary\nand Deputy-President candidates is that if there had been an\nalliance among any four of the candidates the voting might\nhave been very different. For instance Butty would have\noffered the Bot-Zoo-Silwood vote to a running mate, Morrisby\nChemistry and most obviously of all Pywell's name on the\nticket might have given the Physics vote. Perhaps the biggest\nadvantage would have been that the number of abstentions\nin the Vice-Presidential elections might have been reduced,\nfor 141 abstained here against 59 in the Presidential election\n\u2014a significant number when compared with a majority of\nonly 38.\nGood to see the great increase in paper communications\naround the college. Pete Dowlin's RCS Broadsheet is probably\nwell known to RCS men and the RSM, in response to demand\nfrom first years, is now following suit. Some people may\nhave heard of the independent broadsheet of the left, CEFE,\n(Current Evens\u2014Future Events) add to this Father Ivor's, by\nnow, hardy perennial, \"Chi-Rho\" and on another plane\n\"Beeno\" and we begin to see just how much is being pub-li shed. It would be a pity if ICU did not respond to all this\ngrass-roots journalism and consider whether its limited\nduplicating facilities are adequate.\nREX\nThis week our President writes on the alternatives to our present examination system.\nResearch into Teaching Methods is nowadays an\naccepted subject in education, but the companion study of\nExamination Methods is still very much in its infancy. Many\ndifferent examination methods have now been devised and\nthere can be any combination of written or oral, memory or\nopen book, and fixed time or open ended examinations. In\naddition to this, there has always been the choice of asking\nbook work questions or problems and the alternatives of\nof frequent tests or yearly examinations. This list is by no\nmeans comprehensive but it does illustrate some of the opportunities which examiners are now realising.\nIn recent years there has been both a great increase in\nthe number of alternatives used to test students and a suggestion to use several different methods on any one course.,\nWhat has not been generally realized is that an arb it ary mixture of methods is not necessarily the final, or best,\nsolution. A great deal of research is needed, by educational\nexperts, to find out just what qualities each of these methods\nreally measure. Only then is it possible to determine what\nabilities examinations ought to measure and how the right\nmixture can be obtained.\nDifferent people may have vastly differing abilities in\nmemory, understanding and original thought and it seems\nthat eventually some method of assessing students separately\nin each of such categories will have to be used. A breakdown\nlike this would be harder to achieve but it would be much\nmore useful than the present simple class divisions of a degree\n\u2014and also much fairer.\n\n"

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX 20th March, 1969\nThe Function\nYour Place in this Place\nthe University\nby Les Ebdon\nThe trouble with a question such as 'what is the function\nof a University?' is that it is a question with only one\nanswer \u2014 the function is to educate \u2014 but the answer\ncan be interpreted in a score of different ways. This is of\ncourse why Universities resemble particles in Brownian\nmotion continually being acted upon by forces. Many forces\nexert pressures on universities and each of these forces\ninterprets the word \"education\" in a different way. Thus\nthe resulting University, like so many institutions of society,\nis a compromise or, put scientifically, the resolution of\nthese forces.\nLet us identify a few of these forces, or pressure groups.\nObviously we must list the Government and Industry, both\ninfluential paymasters, the University administrators and\nthe academic staff and, to an extent we shall discuss later\nthe students.\nGOVERNMENT CONTROL\nRecently a group of academics have called for a University completely independent of the Government. They\nwould appear to resent the increasing control, exercised\nthrough finance, of the Government. Universities are no\nlonger isolated a cede mic institutions but subject to the\ngeneral economic situation. In this context, i.e. the general\nshortage of money from the University Grants Committee,\nthe promise that the UGC will not direct how grants are\nto be spent \u2014 to provide, according to Robbins, 'an efficient\nAt a special meeting of the Felix awards\ncommittee the following were voted Felix\nawards of the year.\nPhilip Marshall: Castrated Politico of the\nYear.\nRex Lowin: Paper tiger of the Year.\nJane Pearson: Pipe-smoker of the Year.\nBarry Hood: Academic thug of the Year.\nPiers Corbyn: Isaac Newton award for\nAction.\nDave Foster: Isaac Newton award for Reaction.\nJURGO: Pantomime of the Year.\nDermott Corr: Foreign Student of the\nYear.\nLes Ebdon: Stirrer of the Year.\nCarnival Week: Non-event of the Year.\nHelen Lewis: Chris Yewlett special Award.\nPete Dolwin: Mr. R.C.S. Popularity of the\nYear.\nLord Penney: Correspondent of the Year.\nHenry: . . . what's that?\nBarry Sullivan: Drunkard of the Year.\nC.C. Parker: Special Nabarro Award for\nthe Pseud-in-Chief.\nChris Yewlett: Helen Lewis special Award.\nJohn Andrews: Piss-artist of the Year.\nChris Lewis: Most Promising Pseud.\nC.& G.U.: Special Award for the \"white\ncollared, well scrubbed students with\nshort back and sides.\"\nDave Christopher: Most Promising Stirrer\nof the Year.\nshield against the intrusion into academic life and policy of\nirrelevant political influences' has become rather meaning-less. As quoted previously in FELIX, Edward Short has\nput it rather bluntly: 'Universities should become\nincreasingly aware of the demands of the economy'. Now\nthose demands of the economy not only mean that the\ngovernment encourages research in certain areas and discourages it in others, thus deforming scientific research,\nbut it also means that the word 'educate' is interpreted as\n'train'. Technologists and scientists are trained at IC by the\ngovernment so that in numbers and training they are 'fully\nadequate to the national needs' (UGC terms of reference).\nHowever, it is difficult to see how academic freedom\nin its old sense can be maintained. No university can survive without money and it is difficult to see how the concept\nof the university as seen by the government and as seen\nby industry differs, to the extent that academics can play\nthe two off against each other and remain free. Industry\ncan indeed be enticed into investing into a university but\nit is as interested in obtaining a return on this investment\nas the government. Indeed, industry would seem to be insisting that universities go into 'production' \u2014 production\nof research and trained graduates \u2014 even more than the\ngovernment.\nThe pressure of the academic staff and university\nadministrators is not quite as apparent, partly because it is\nnot an homogenous pressure, partly because it runs counter\nto the general direction of society. If we ignore those\nin administration who are representatives of industry or\nthe government, then the staff and admin share the same\n'academic' outlook. Traditionally, academics look upon\nuniversities as 'centres of academic excellence' isolated\nfrom the general pressures of society. To the academic,\ntherefore, 'education' is interpreted as 'specialization'.\nStudents are expected to achieve a high standard of proficiency in a small area and scant attention is paid to the\nproblem of the inter-actions, ethical or social, of their\nstudies or research on society or the world as a whole.\nWhat then is the pressure exerted by the student? For\nthe vast majority of students at IC the university is a degree\nprovider. As the result of a certain amount of hard work\nand exam passing a degree is obtain?d which leads to higher\nearnings, greater security and enhanced social status. Education is interpreted as 'amassing knowledge'.\nTHE COMPROMISE\nPerhaps we have caricatured these pressures but it does\nat least lead us to an understanding of what the nature\nof the compromise is. It is this compromise that the thinking\nperson must take and marry to a proper understanding of\nthe meaning of education. Education is more than training\nor specialization or gathering of knowledge \u2014 it has something to do with fulfilment. If we agree the purpose is not to\nturn out clever chimpanzees or electronic data stores, what\npressures can be brought to counterbalance those already\nmentioned?\nThe first thing scientists and technologists should recognise is that whereas scientific discovery is basically amoral\nits application has profound ethical repercussions. We must\naccept that in universities 'academic freedom' is now a myth and that research is directed upon particular lines\nand development similarly deformed. Now this direction\nmay not be entirely bad, but a few cases from recent\nhistory will serve as a salutary illustration. The colossal\ninvestment in the research of nuclear physics did not arise\nbecause of 'academic interest', nor did its development as\na basis for weapons of mass destruction. The continued\ninterest in certain hydro carbons, particularly the alkyl a tion, has underlying motives. Enormous sums of money\nhave been spent investigating the foaming properties of\nsolutions of these compounds, commonly known as deter-gents, rather than their cleaning properties. The 'profit\nmotive' diverts research from those avenues most profitable\nto man to those avenues which make most money. Academic\nfreedom can never return; if it did it would be an exercise\nin irresponsibility in a world of small resources and large\nneeds, but if research is to be directed it must be directed\nto the solution of the major problem such as mass starvation\nthat face us.\nBut research is merely one aspect of the educational\nproblem; teaching is another. If we reject the concept of\nthe university as a training school to fit poeple to fill certain\nprojected vacancies in society, then it is because we reject\nth concept of un critically accepting society. An educated\nperson is not merely a specialist who reacts to every given\nsituation using his special skills but incorporates these\nsituations into his general understanding, ready to use them\nif necessary. This applies particularly to the good scientist\nwhose theories are based on a particular kind of experience\nwe term 'experiments'. An educated person is able to learn\nby experience. When a number of art colleges were closed\nlast summer the art students were forced to teach themselves;\nin doing so they rediscovered this fundamental idea of\nlearning by experience. Scientists and technologists must\nensure they retain and develop this aspect of their e duca tion. This therefore becomes a high priority in consul at ions with students about revision of courses.\nHowever, we cannot ignore the fact that living in a society, as men do, we are all involved in relationships\nand indeed living is in many ways to be seen in terms of\nrelationships. If education is to be of value it must teach\npeople something about relationships. It is because of this\nthat attention must be given to the staff-student relationship\nand to the breaking down of barriers. If students and staff\ntogether are to be able effectively to counter the pressures\nof Government and Industry they must in some way bring\ntheir views to the admin, which is, of course, where we\nbegan last issue.\nWashing dirty linen in public\nLast Thursday we were at\nlast able to see the 'Horizon'\ndocumentary 'The Drift\nfrom Science\", parts of\nwhich were shot at Imperial\nCollege before Christmas.\nAs might be expected\nfrom the title, there were the\ninevitable statistics to illustrate the decline in\npopularity of the sciences,\ntogether with some not very\nconvincing theories to explain away the trend. The\nfilm was, superficially, a fair, factual document, but\nthe subtle visual tricks which\nthe film - makers used to\nput science in its worst\nlight could not escape even\nthe most impartial observer.\nFor example, in the\nnumerous interviews with\nsixth - former s, both arts\nand sciences: the arts\nstudents were always filmed\nout in the open air whereas\nthe science students were\nin a Lab or classroom.\nAt one point, both arts\nand science sixth - former s were asked to list possible\nuses for a top hat; a psychologist explained that the\nresponse to such a question\nwould indicate a convergent ie. 'scientific' or divergent ie. 'artistic' mind. It\nseems a reasonable assumption that any person of\naverage intelligence, no\nmatter how convergent his\nmind, could think of at\nleast one or two uses for a top hat. By showing science\nstudents sitting open-mouthed and cons pico us ly silent, th g film began to\nstretch one's credulity a little too far. The film then\nshowed arts students reeling\noff a string of bizarre\nsuggestions with apparently\nno prompting.\nAs the film progressed\nfrom schools to universities,\nonly science students were\ninterviewed. We were told\nof the four year course at\nKeele, the Humanities for\nScientists at Nottingham and\na group of students from\nManchester talked in glowing terms about their course\nin liberal studies for science\nstudents.\nThen came the moment\nwe had all been waiting for:\nImperial College, the foremost college of science and\ntechnology in Britain, came\nunder scrutiny. And what\ndid our students have to say?\n\"They don't teach us to\nmanage people here, just a load of scientific facts . . .\"\n\". . . . staff only seem\nconcerned to train research\nAlan Morris\nstudents and nothing else\n. . .\" and numerous other\ncritical comments, with\nwhich I think many people\nwholly agree. And were we\ngiven the thrill of hearing\nour name on the box?\nDefinitely not.\nIt strikes me as being\nsomewhat more than strange\nthat three other universities\nshould be named and congratulated on their science\ncourses, whereas the socalled 'spearhead of the\ntechnological revolution'\nshould be laid bare and remain anonymous. On ref lec tion, though, it isn't as inexplicable as one might think.\nIn that programme, IC's dirty linen was washed in\npublic. Be that good or bad,\none wonders just who didn't want the public to know\nwhose dirty washing it was.\n\n"

Despite its dainty\ndimensions it is, in fact, a cinema which displays its name,\nthe Paris Pullman, in bold letters on the front. Situated just\nnorth of Chelsea's boutiques and just south of a bizarre\nconcoction of buildings collectively referred to as Imperial\nCollege, this building offers its diminutive premises to both\nthe groovy intellectuals of the King's Road and the more\ndigitally orientated chap from Exhibition Road alike \u2014\nthe common bond, in theory, being a desire to see the\ncinema exploited beyond the straight jacket of Elstree\non on? hand and Hollywood on the other. To heighten your\nappreciation a haze of \"Disc-Bleu\" and a subdued background of Italian and French dialectic enable you, with a little imagination to transport yourself to a street cafe on\nthe Seine or a 'Piazza' in Naples where you chat with\nAntonioni, Fellini, Godard and Chabrol while sipping your\ndesert-dry Martini. In short, a trip to the Paris Pullman\nmeans you want to see something different \u2014 something\nmellow and something sad, something not to be found in\nthe Union Bar\u2014Something else.\nAt the beginning of the session I wanted to include the\nParis Pullman's programmes as often as possible in this\ncolumn. The place is handy and for 6/6 you can get at\nLeast ten feet from the screen. They began their season\nwith Istvan Szabo's \"Father\" and, although rather hackneyed and anticipated, it was a sensible start. Then, for\nsome reason, probably shortage of money, they got hold of\n\"Elvira Madigan\" as the billboard put it \u2014 \" . . . for a season.\" This may have saved on time and funds but it\nundoubtedly lost them support since \"Elvira\" had already\nbeen seen by most people in the West End. Next came\nabsolute rock-bottom. The \"Queen\" was a documentary\nrecord of a male beauty contest which I imagine was supposed to titillate your sense of humour before making you\nsick. It's difficult to wallow further beneath a nadir so\n\"Before the Revolution\" \u2014 now showing \u2014 just had to be\nan improvement\u2014relatively speaking.\nIt's very popular in the Pseud-circles these days to wax\nlyrical on how middle-aged directors are best fitted to\nmake films about youth. You just reel off \"The Graduate\",\n\"If . . .\", \"The Family Way\", \"Kestrel for a Knave\" ad\nablution and nobody tells you that this is simply because\nmost film directors are middle-aged anyway. Bernado Bertolucci was a stripling of 22 when he made, or rather created,\n\"Before the Revolution\" and the film is immeasurably\nmore sensitive and communicative for being a thinly disguised autobiography. \"Prima della Rivoluzione\" was first\nshown in Cannes in 1964 and, as Bertolucci's first major\nfilm, received acclaim, not only as a mature work of art,\nbut as a portrayal of the conflict experienced\u2014particularly\nthen\u2014by many young people in Europe and America, a conflict whose resolution has resulted in the pervading\nreality of student power in contemporary society.\nIn \"Prima\" you will not readily identify with Fabrizio\n\u2014the young student in the small Italian town of Parma. For\nhim, the revolution is crystallised, not so much by Lenin or\nMarx or the exploits of Che in the Bolivian Jungle, but by\nthe village schoolmaster, Cesare, who carries the implication of enlightenment by education when most of the\ntownsfolk are oppressed via ignorance. Thus for Parma,\nthe revolution is a long way off and the best Cesare can\ndo is teach his school-kids the inevitability of it all by\nwell-chosen tracts from Moby Dick where Ahab's pursuit\nof the great white whale is as \" . . . timeless as it is des-tin ed\". Fabrizio can do little more than discuss, debate, expound and idea lise but his dogma is so paper-thin that the\nreal way to his heart is obviously via his convictions.\nIt will doubtless be distasteful to many of Imperial\nCollege's home geno us icon oe lasts that Bertolucci's film\nresorts to a love-affair as the omnipotent antidote to excess\nrevolutionary fer v our. Fabrizio falls passionately for a visiting aunt and Adriana Asti's acting as the \"Aunt\" Gina\nfrom Milan, is surpassed only by her complete Latin beauty.\nThere is an understated yet obvious dichotomy. Fabrizio's Marxist ideals, forming the aesthetic, are in bare conflict\nwith his passion which is knowingly incestuous. Gina also\nhas a conflict. One particular scene reveals that her visit\nis not one of good-will, especially, but is a therapy for some\nneurotic malaise which she developed in Milan. There is\na suggestion of nymphomania and the tragedy of the film is\nrealised when she recognises that she \u2014 the embodiment\nof this disease \u2014 should not pollute the 'pure' mind of\nher nephew. She leaves suddenly and, in his absolute grief\nover her, Fabrizio is broken \u2014 no doctrine can soothe the\nheart's pain, no ideal can acquit the ultimate aesthetic of\nthe human bond between a man and a woman and no\nmaxim like \"Sin is the only rejection of Bourgeoise values\"\ncan ever again excuse a consummated love-affair. He\nrealises that he too is destined to be part of the Bourgeoisie\nwhose standards are his heritage and even the reappearance\nof Gina cannot prevent his entire absorption into the system\nhe once eschewed by his marriage to the daughter of a local opera impresario and devout capitalist. His own\nmother pronounces his epitaph\u2014\" . . . he's changed\u2014he\naccepts everything\" \u2014 the ie has been no 1984-type torture\nto bring this about \u2014 the process has been basic, human\nand all the more complete.\nIt is a long film. For two hours Bertolucci uses camera\nexpertise and appropriate dialectic to probe a gamut of\nhuman emotions and exigencies which most of us can only\nexperience without recognising. The acting is not great -\u2014\nwith the exception of Adriana Asti as Gina. The arguments\nare not all clear and not always ostensibly relevant\u2014there\nare parts which are tedious. But the size of the undertaking\nwas enormous the thematic requirements difficult and the\ndirecting experience sometimes lacking. But if only as an\nantidote to standard procedure this film should be seen.\nIf only because Bertolucci's style pioneers previously un-chartered regions of film art with one aim \u2014 to obtain the\nmaximum expressiveness in every visual element and every\nsituation. The imagery is explicit, the music superb, the\nmedium justified, the message fulfilled\u2014the cigarette smoke\nunnoticed.\nCOLLEGE DISCIPLINE\nA working party is going to be set up to investigate dis-c ip line, the three areas for consideration being double\npunishment, the power of wardens, hall discipline and the\nbringing of the name of the college into disrepute.\nSome clarification is surely needed concerning double\npunishment. As I understand it, double punishment simply\nmeans being punished twice for the same offence. An example\nwould be someone who, having been given 10 years imprisonment by the High Court, was then given another 5 years by\nhis local magistrate. Although such treatment would clearly\nviolate every principle of common justice, it is important,\nto note that some offences exist which are of a double;\ncharacter.\nA simple example would be someone driving the wrong*\nway down a one way street and breaking the speed limit*\nat the same time. This person would receive two punish-?\nment s, one for each offence. This is NOT double punish-',\nment. Consider the case of someone stealing funds from a> private club. He would be prosecuted by the police for the'\ntheft and expelled from the club for betraying the con-'\nfide n ce of that club. *\nWhen people say that double punishment is justified in1 certain cases, what they surely mean to say is that someone'1\nwho commits two offences should receive two punishments.'\nIn view of the fact that no case of double punishment has-arisen for the last ten years, it makes me wonder why the\nsubject was ever brought up in the first place.\nSome aspects of the above discussion are clearly relevant\nto the power of wardens. For example, should someone'\npeddling drugs in Hall be prosecuted and also expelled from\nthe Hall? I believe that the most qualified people to answer'\nthis question are the members of the Hall Committee and\nthat the decision should rest with them.\nAll matters of discipline should be treated by the Hall\nCommittee, (this is surely one of the reasons for their\nexistence). The warden should neither dominate the proceedings nor play no part in them. If an acceptable solution\nis to be found, all parties concerned must be consulted.\nThe most important feature that should exist in a Hall is\na level of trust and confidence between the residents. There\nmust be a guarantee that if you put your milk in the fridge\nin the morning, it will still be there when you go for it\nin the evening. If this guarantee does not exist the whole\nsystem collapses into anarchy. The only adequate punishment for someone found guilty of stealing from fridges\nand laundries is expulsion from the Hall. At one Hall of\nResidence, for example, morning papers have had to be\ncancelled due to a few selfish individuals who insisted on\nremoving them before anyone else had a chance to read\nthem. The question of overnight guests is a rather nebulous\none and can only be treated on individual merit by the Hall\nCommittee.\nI was recently alarmed to hear that Council had decided\nthat no-one should be punished for bringing the name of the\nCollege into disrepute. The argument here was that we act\nas individuals and should be treated as such. The only snag\nhere is that although students may behave individually, they\nare treated collectively. Many students trying to hitch across\nFrance last summer complained bitterly about the lack of\nlifts, and placed the blame squarely on \"those bloody French\nstudents.\" Any young person wearing an anorak and blue\njeans was assumed to be an avid revolutionary. Mention\nthe word \"student\" to a member of the British public and\nhe immediately thinks of some long-haired, unwashed\ncharacter with a protest banner.\nThough this may be a naive attitude, it is certainly the\none that exists, and should be recognised as such. The good\nname of the college is particularly important for those\nstudents, for example, miners, who travel abroad for part\nof their course. It is no use claiming that it is only our\nacademic name that is of importance, there are other places\nof learning and if we insist on creating havoc we shall no\nlonger be invited. I do not agree that academic excellence\nshould be used as an excuse for drunken or boorish\nbehaviour.\nLike it or not, we are treated as a group and it is as a group that we stand or fall. Both good behaviour and bad\nbehaviour reflect on every member of the college, anyone\nwho degrades the college by his action must be punished\naccordingly.\nThe whole issue of discipline is a very large and a very\ncomplex one. Double punishment, power of wardens, Hall\nCommittees, bringing the college into disrepute are all\ninter-related topics, and one can only hope that the working\nparty will not be rushed into making any hasty decisions.\nAlthough motions passed at Union meetings have their\nvalue I do not feel that they should be regarded as being\nthe last word on the matter.\nBRIAN HAINS\n\n"

The most obvious is that\nthe male-female ratio is ridiculous compared with society (USK would help if official machinations do not\nalienate surrounding col-leg es); resulting in one of\npresent-day man's greatest\nfears, that of being thought\nhomosexual, making men\nhere behave with so-called\n'masculine' reactions; e.g. unnecessary heavy drinking\nand swearing, violence and\nrepression of artistic feelings\nleading to childish protective\nin stic ts, cliques and minority\ndiscrimination as shown by\nconstituent colleges, no NUS\nmembership, ICWA, the\nUnion Bar rule.\nThe second is that with\ntoo many lectures etc. IC has\na school like atmosphere detrimental to staff-student re-lat a ions making students\nfeel inferior to staff, a feeling helped by madness es like the present exam system,\nThe Editor reserves the right to\nomit all or part of any letter\nsubmitted to Felix.

If a few more men\nand women decided to be\nabsolutely honest in all their\ndealings and tried to find\nanswers on the basis of what\nis right and not who is right,\nthen things would change a lot faster, both in the College and in the nation.\nGeoffrey Craig,\nMin Tech PG\nDirection of Science\nSir,\nTo see the true nature of\nthe staff-student committees,\nthey must be put in their con-texts. Science is not a static\nentity but must be constantly\ndeveloping. This requires the\nfull participation of all those\nconcerned^. Potential scientists must be put in a position\nto survey, analyse and direct\nscience. This is one possible\nrole of the committees \u2014 to\nbring both staff and students\ntogether to criticise and control their work.\nHowever, the controllers\nof industry want persons sufficiently competent to execute\ngiven tasks, but too ignorant\nto criticise the purpose of the\ntasks. The authoritarian\nteaching structure and the\nexam system work towards\nalienating the student from\nany sense of purpose in his\nwork, apart from the social\nself-improvement afforded by\na degree. In this latter con-text, we see the role of the\ncommittees as they tend to\nwork towards increasing the\nefficiency of the college\nmachine and as a sop to \"stu-dent participation.\"\nIn physics, however, we\nsee a glimpse of the former\nrole: a movement to bring\nthe committee \"to examine\nthe whole purpose of physics\neducation\". One hopes that\nthis means more than an examination of the efficiency of\nthe system. It may be that\nthose involved have sufficient\nvision to attempt to equip\nfuture generations of students\nwith the knowledge and attitudes that are the means of\ncontrol over the direction of\ntheir science. If they dare attempt this transformation of\nthe very nature of the de-partment, then, certainly, a head-on clash with the authorities, which has seemed so\nremote from I.C., will become a startling reality.\nYours fraternally,\nD. Christopher\nMaths 1\nTrade Unions in Universities\nClive Jenkins hoped he'd address us soon as 'brothers\nand sisters' rather than\n'ladies and gentlemen'. The\nJoint General Secretary of\nthe ASTMS was talking to\nan assorted 50 or so members of IC a week ago.\nHis union are most interested in the white collar\nworkers as they are 'one of\nthe most vigorously exploited\ngroups in the country'. There\nwas a new attitude among\nthem now \u2014 a few years ago\nthese people 'didn't think a union could help'. However,\nnow the white collar men\nare the 'most dynamic sector\nof British trade unionism\nbecause the people in it are\nthe most dissatisfied'.\nClive recalled that their\nbranch at IC was one of the\noldest. ASTMS is now recruiting academic staff and\nare considering a merger\nwith the Association of University Teachers. 'There is a need for a much more comprehensive trade union organisation in the universities',\nJenkins continued. Danger\nlay in the Prices and Incomes\nBoard which was 'assuming\nthe character of employers\nwithout the managerial re-sp on sibi li ties'. A one-day\nstrike is planned in April..\nOne college staff member\ndisclosed the fear his colleagues had of joining a trade\nunion. They mistrusted the\nmethods used in negotiations.\nAlso he wasn't convinced\nthat a one-day strike would\nhave much effect. But Clive\nhad the answers. 'Collective\nbargaining', was the key and\nacademic staff needed experienced experts to put their\ncase; i.e. the ASTMS. On the\nstrike, the mass media would\nensure its success.\nAnswering another question about wage increase\n'drying up the economy', Jenkins was unruffled. 'Britain is\nrich\u2014she has a balance of\npayments surplus of \u00a3300m.a year. But the surplus is\nturned into a deficit because\nof the politicians' mistakes'.\nAs examples he quoted the\nFill and paying aid to Singapore, which he regards as\na 'police state'.\nHe briefly mentioned the\nsituation in the steel industry\n\u2014'there are regrettably some\nfriction s with other trade\nunions'. This was because of\nthe latter's fight for self-pre-serva tion in the face of declining membership.\nAll through his short\nspeech and the questions\nafterwards Clive Jenkins\nradiated affable self-confidence. But not far beneath the\nsurface one could sense the\ntough negotiator and the\nshrewdness that has helped\nto make ASTMS the fastest\ngrowing union in the co un try.\nRevolution in the Theatre\nIf you want some good straightforward theatre, go and\nsee 'Hide Out' at the Westminster Theatre. Set in a ski-hut\nsomewhere in Europe, it deals with revolution and counter-revolution, politics, love, hate and death. The story starts\nwith a reunion of old Resistance fighters, an odd mixture of\nmen and women whom only a strong cause could bring\ntogether. As they chat and banter, criticise and discuss, their\nerstwhile chief in the resistance dramatically announces another revolution. Guns and people come and go and strong\nemotions burst out. The son of one of the fighters, Walther\nKrohn (Victor Lucas), is inextricably mixed up in the new\nfight. Everything moves fast with many cross-currents, and\nas the curtain falls at the end of the acts there is a certain\ntenseness.\nThe characters are all interesting \u2014 some more predictable than others. The one\nwho eventually has the most\ninfluence never appears on\nthe stage and has the unlikely\noccupation of teaching the\nviolin. Especially likeable are\nDavid Stewart as the Bishop\nand Philip Friend as Max, an\nartist. Here is a churchman\nwho stands for his faith and\nfinds it practical in every situ-ation, and another who\nbreaks out of his artistic\nworld and dies for his con-vict ions. The whole play is\nconcerned with the central\nissue of who will control in\nfamilies and nations, and\nwith the real meaning of\nfreedom. It is the story of\nmany people and countries\nand is frighteningly topical\nin these days.\nThe set is well designed\nand defies connection with\nany particular country,\nthough it is obviously European. It is more than competent in creating the atmosphere. One drawback in the Westminster is its comfort-\u2014after\na hard day's study the tendency is to doze. However,\nthe student price of 5/- and\na dramatic, thoughtful play,\ncaptured the interest of this\ndour technologist!\nGeoffrey Craig\n\n"

Union meeting to discuss the\nproposed constitutional reforms opened last Thursday.\nAbout 430 students packed\ninto Mech. Eng. 220 and in\na meeting lasting nearly\nthree hours voted in a number of important constitutional changes. After throwing out the council document\nthe meeting based discussion\non the original working\nparty report. Before the\nRents Shock - U.G.C. force increase in\nHall Rents\nAt the last meeting of the\nResidence Committee, it was\ndecided to increase Hall rents\nby 20% from the beginning\nof next session. The reason\nfor this large increase is two-fold: According to the estimates for the present session,\nit is expected that there will\nbe a deficit of \u00a35,680. To\ncover this deficit next year\nan increase of 8|% in all\nrents will be needed.\nU.G.C. The major increase is due\nto a letter from the U.G.C. stating that the Halls themselves must be responsible\nfor meeting the cost of mes-sen gers, security guards and\nthe salaries of the Clerks to\nthe Halls. In the past the College has met these costs, although most London University Halls do charge these\nitems to the Hall rents. The\nincreased cost to the Halls\nwill be in the region of\n\u00a312,000 making a total deficit of about \u00a318,000, which\ncan be met only by a minimum of 20% increase in\nrents.\nThe increase will not affect\nStudent House residents,\nwhose rents will remain the\nsame. As far as Linstead\nHall is concerned, the increase is on the room charge\nalone, and the dining in\ncharge will remain at 7/6d. In Garden Hall, the rents\npayed for double and treble\nrooms will be adjusted so as\nto compare more favourably\nwith the cost of a single\nroom, although the average\nincrease will be 20%,\nComparisons\nIn its report recommending\nthe increases, the Sub-Committee obtained the comparable rents for other University Halls. After allowing for\nis\n(the cost of meals, which\nincluded in some London\nHall rents, and adding 20%\nto the present I.C. hall rents\nit was found that other rents\nvaried between \u00a393 and \u00a3122,\nwith the majority around\n\u00a3108. With the 20% increase a room in a new I.C. hall will cost \u00a397.4 and one\nin Beit old Hostel \u00a386.8.\nConferences\nAn investigation is going\nto be made into the possibility of cutting down on the\namount of cleaning in Halls.\nThe stumbling block here is\nthat all the cleaners are\nneeded for vacation confer-en ces, which contribute -J of\nthe total income of \u00a381,000,\nwhere visitors pay around\n35/- per night, and so expect\na complete cleaning service.\nA cut in the wage bill might\nresult in a cut in Conference\nincome, without very much\ntotal gain.\nmeeting adjourned until\nTuesday (see FELICITY) it\nwas decided to elect the\nPresident, Deputy President\nand Secretary by a college-wide ballot and the size of\ncouncil was increased by the\naddition of 11 departmental\nreps and an Academic\nOfficer.\nRex Lowin opened the\nmeeting quietly enough, the\nminutes being taken as read.\nArising from this it was announced that the new milk\nmachine had been sent back,\nCouncil had reversed its decision not to give Mr. Garby,\nthe former FELIX printer, a gift. The Rector had announced a working party of\n3 staff and 3 students\n(Lowin, Bland and Collinge),\nchaired by a nominated Governor, to discuss disciplinary\nprocedures, including ICU's total opposition to a double-punishment.\nResignations\nThe first excitement came\nwhen the letters of resignation of the working party\nmembers, who wished to present their report to the\nUnion, were read. John\nHunt, a floor rep on council, also had written a letter\nMartin Bland proposing that the original report of the\nWorking Party be discussed by the Union Meeting.\nof resignation. Hunt felt out\nof sympathy with Union\nmembers over the LSE motion and also complained of\ncouncils \"petty politics\" over\nthe constitution.\nFollowing a letter describing Council's treatment of\nthe working party report on\nthe constitution, Martin\nBland, working party chair-man, moved a motion proposing that the working\nparty report be taken as the\nbasis of discussion. Bland\nstated that the working party\nhad taken two terms to\nreach a compromise constitution based on informed\nconsultations; Council on\nthe other hand had made\ntheir own constitution in two\nhours. Opposing, Dermott\nCorr attacked the way the\nworking party had worked\nand suggested among mounting interruptions from the\nfloor, that their report was\nnot considered enough, Dave\nWield, seconding the motion,\ndisputed Corr's allegations\nand pointed out that Council\nhad diluted the report, something better left to a Union\nmeeting. A newly shaven\nChris Parker rose to urge a by now impatient meeting to\naccept the council report as\nmore representative, and appeared to claim the motion\nwas a vote of no confidence\nin Council. A show of hands\nwas all that was needed to\ndefeat council and back the\nworking-party by 233 votes\nto 159 against.\nMarathon\nMartin Bland then began\na marathon proposal of the\nworking-party's recommended new constitution.

Certain social\ncharacteristics unify them into a small social class and\nrestrict their interactions with members of other social\nclasses. These characteristics include the complete financial\ndependence of vagrants upon the community and the corresponding negative attitude towards work, a very restricted\nrange of pleasures (alcohol and gambling), a lack of any\nserious interest in reform or renewal of contacts with their\nfamilies, their dirty and untidy appearance, and of course\nsimply not having a home. Compared with the conventional\nsocial classes the vagrant class is very tiny \u2014 a few tens of\nthousands of men in Britain. For much of their lives the men,\nthere are very few women, are highly mobile with respect to\nwhere they work and where and how they live. They have\nall become vagrants by a process of social decline.\nThe vagrant class constitutes probably not more than\n0.06% of the total population. But vagrants are very much\nin evidence in certain areas of most cities. In the Borough of\nTower Hamlets there are many hostels (over 2,000 beds),\nmany vagrants and a number of voluntary welfare organ-iz at ions. Our organization (St. George's) serves an average of\n55 men on five nights a week and we have given clothing\nto over 600 men in twelve months, many of whom have come\nback week after week for more.\nIn some ways the vagrant class functions as a sort of\ninstitution which shelters its inmates from the rest of society.\nUnfortunately the effect of this institution \u2014 where society\n\"puts away\" those individuals who fail to comply with its\nminimal requirements \u2014 is to encourage its members' decline,\nphysical and mental. Vagrants are brought together by a variety of problems \u2014 physical and mental illnesses as well\nas social difficulties. They are by no means all alcoholics or\nall anything else. What they have in common is the lack of\na home \u2014 they sleep in hostels or in derelict buildings. To\ngeneral is e further without very great care is unjustified.\nThe Simon community is dedicated to helping\nsocial rejects who are beyond the effective\nrange of the welfare state. Every night the\norganisation sends, to various parts of London,\nvans carrying soup and bread which is given\nto drop-outs along the route-the SOUP RUN.\nAt St. George's Men's Care Unit and St. Botolph's Rehabilitation Centre (two units in the East End attached to a Methodist and an Anglican church respectively) we are\nattempting to meet some of the human needs of homeless\nmen. Most of our energies are spent in providing free and\nsub sidi sed food as malnutrition is one of the first problems\nwith which we must deal. As our relationships with particular men grow we are able to give them the opportunity of\nbenefiting from our developing facilities \u2014 medical help,\noccupational therapy, group therapy for alcoholics. We avoid\npreaching at the men. We believe that the welcoming, accepting attitude we encourage among our helpers is of considerable importance \u2014 it is the only way of undermining men's anti-social feelings. Beyond our two units we are slowly developing working relationships with more specialized organ-iz at ions. Also, by education in the widest sense, we are seeking to break down the social barriers between the men and\nthe community in which we live and work.\nA few members of Imperial College help regularly at St.\nGeorge's. If any one would like to know more of our work,\nor to help or to give us food, clothing or money they should\nwrite to me in the Chemistry Department, where I am a research student, or at St. George's Men's Care Unit, 240\nCable Street, E.I., where I live.\nWhy do people go on\n\"Soup Runs\"?\nFor most people who ever\ngo, a 'soup run' is probably\na sort of mixture of \u2014 something 'useful', an interesting\nexperience, something to\nthink about, a trip with\nfriendly people, an escape\nfrom immediate problems, a window to glance at society\nfrom underneath, or just\n'why not?'.\nIt is a bit surprising when\nyou first go and realise that\nthere are so many misfits who\nhang around without much\npurpose in life except, per-hap s, to avoid being moved\non by policemen, Every person you meet has a long\nstory which might explain his\npresent position; occasionally\nyou will hear some of the\nmore sorrowful parts \u2014 for\nexample, the old lady who\ncomplained that every time\nshe went anywhere to get\nhelp \"it was obvious that\nthey were all against me\" \u2014\nor pick up a few philosophical observations \u2014 \"You\n'social workers' can do so\nmany things and you've got\nthis problem (alcohol) and\nyou can't do anything about\nit\" . . . and so on. Most of\nthe drop - outs you meet\ncould, in theory at least, get\na job and/or live 'securely'\nbut do not want to.\nThe dedication of the 'per-man ent' Simon workers is\ntruely amazing; some of them\nwere 'drop-outs' themselves\nonce. If anyone understands\nwhat it is all about, they do.\nThe escapist aspect of\ngoing on the soup run \u2014 like\nthat for many other activities\n\u2014 is fascinating. For instance \u2014 a meeting of IC\nCouncil with its bickering s about standing orders and\nstopping each other speaking\nassumes its true insignificance when followed by a conversation in the rain with\na man from Armenia (?) who\nis explaining how he gets\nmore money than he should\nfrom the MOSS (Ministry of\nSocial Security).\nThe usefulness of what\nyou do may not seem very\ngreat when you realize that\nthe drop-outs who really do\nneed help are, of course, inaccessible on a bomb site\nsomewhere. Anyway, times\nare harder in Biafra. It is\nfun on a soup run \u2014 meeting all sorts of interesting\npeople, both on the run and\nin the van. Of course, talking to the people is 'useful' to\nthem as well as being fun\nfor you,\nYou gain SELF-EDUCATION. Something is clearly\nwrong with a society, if not\na world, which produces misfits such as these people \u2014\nwho are really only another\naspect of the many individuals who are constantly\nalienated by today's society.\nTHE PROBLEM IS NOT\nTHE PEOPLE \u2014 THE PROBLEM IS THE SYSTEM.\n\n"

R.C.S. and Mines have already decided on the people they wish to\nrepresent them on Council next year. The Guilds elections will be held next term, when there may also be the exciting\nprospect of election the I.C. President democratically for the first time.\nButty sweeps home Barker beats bar-crowd\nAbout 150 RCS people\npacked into Physics Lecture\nTheatre 3 for the RCSU\nmeeting on March 11th. A letter from E.G. Perrins attacking Les Ebdon was read\nto a mixed reception. Then\nthe main business followed\nand wild cheering greeted\nthe announcement of the\nelection results. In the race\nfor the Presidency, RCS\nEnts chairman John Butterworth heavily defeated\nCouncil rep. Chris Kent by\n384 votes to 163. Physicsbred Barry Pywell, of Henry\nfame, just pipped Chemistrybred Theta bearer Steve\nMorrisby by 251 votes to\n213 with 141 abstentions\nand 2 write-in votes for\nHenry.\nA pathetic trial of Gwyn\nHughes, RCS president, was\nled by Vice - President\nAdolf with Pete Dolwin\npressed hastily, and somewhat unwillingly, into the\njob of Defence Counsel and\nLes Ebdon, equally hastily,\ninto helping Adolf with\nthe prosecution. This lack\nof preparation ruined the\npurpose of the trial. Hughes\nwas found guilty after\nevidence had been produced\nof girls 'assaulted' at Carnival and on the ICWA\ncorridor and of conspiracy\nbetween Hughes and a certain Dermott Corr (cue for\nloud hisses).\nThe meeting was interspersed with plaintive tin\nwhistle playing and messages flashed on the screen:\n'Yuk', 'Boo' 'Who's Hughes'\nand 'Gwyn and bear it'.\nHughes and practically\neveryone else was sentenced\nto the Round Pond before\nthe meeting adjourned to\nthe Queen's. Butty thanks his triumphant supporters.\nThe Royal School of Mines had a good showing of\nalmost two hundred people to their annual elections which\nwere held on Tuesday, 11th March. The meeting seemed\nremarkably sober considering the usual tradition of Mines\nUnion meetings. The three candidates battling for the position of President, previously held by Barry Sullivan, were\nTony Mason, Metallurgy III, Peter Earl, Geology II, and\nKen Barker, Oil Technology II.\nHaving been introduced to the meeting the three candidates left while their proposer s spoke on their behalf. In\nturn they gave three moderately lengthy, very similar and\nslightly boring proposal speeches. The second ers then stood\nup and voiced their opinions on the candidates they had not\nseconded. During this mud-slinging match a second er for\nKen Barker stood up and commented to the effect that they\nwere not electing a beer-drinking rugby player but a pre si dent. This consequently produced derision from the rugby\ndrinking sect who appeared to be supporting Tony Mason,\nhowever, this was quick ed drowned by applause from the\nmasses. After this the result of the election was in little doubt.\nKen Barker came to this College via the Distillers Company and the King's College Chemistry Department. It has\nbeen rumoured among certain circles that he got a little lost\non the way. Nevertheless, he has been a year representative\nand is the Rear Commodore of the Sailing Club.\nThe election of the vice-president came next, from the\ntwo candidates, Mike Walton, Metallurgy II, and lohn\nBallard, Mining Technology II. Apathy had set in by this\ntime and the number of abstentions in the vote caused\nBarry Sullivan to call for other nominations. However,\nnone were forthcoming and lohn Ballard was declared duly\nelected. He is a convert from one of the other constituent\ncolleges. According to the proposal speech he has realised\nthe error of his ways and is now a devoted Minesman. The\npositions which he has held include President of the Stoats\nClub and Captain of the I.C. Rugby Club.\nBill Plackett was elected unopposed as Honorary\nSecretary and George Widelski was elected unopposed\nHonorary Pornographer, mainly because of his outstanding\nchoral ability and his memory for many well known songs.\nRacialism at lodgings bureau\nOn February 16th a meeting called by University College Socialist Society decided to\ntake a strong stand against the racialist policies of the University of London Lodging's Bureau. The action decided upon was a one day occupation of the Bureau last Friday,\nMarch 14th. Racialism is a word guaranteed to raise high emotions and its use must be carefully\njustified. The form that the Bureau gives the landlords who want to be on the Bureau's books asks the following:\nWill you welcome students from (i) U.S.A. and Dominions (excluding India); (ii)\nEurope; (iii) Middle East; (iv) China, Malaya and lap an;( v) India and Pakistan; (vi) British West Indies; (vii) West Africa and Sudan.\n70% of the landlords answer no to one or more of these questions. To accommodate\nthis appa rant racial is m, the Bureau keeps separate lists of coloured and white students.\nMrs. Tabert, head of the Bureau claims that \"African and Asian students are pleased\nthat we take these steps to protect them\", i.e. separate lists of whites and coloured s saves\nstudents (and the Bureau) considerable embarrassment.\nThe occupation of the Bureau was called to demand the following: that the Bureau\nlists only those landlords who declare themselves willing to accept any student, regardless\nof race, colour or national origin.\nThe Bureau claims that under an anti-discriminatory policy they would never get\nenough listings to satisfy the demand. It is expected that the University exaggerates the\ndifficulty students would face. Many landlords would change their minds rather than lose\ntheir place on the Bureau's lists.\nAt the moment students can only find rooms at the price of participating in racialist\npolicies.\nMost important is the moral and social responsibility of the University to take a clear\nstand against racial is m in all its forms.\nIt is essential to either stamp out racial is m or to show exactly why it cannot be\nstamped out in the present situation of accommodation shortage.\nPete Dare \u2014 the new President of ULU\u2014is concerned with the problem and is keen\nto resolve the present impasse. Matthew Duncan-Iones.\nEditorial\nComment\nWut}tl&\nFelix Needs Stars and\nStirrers for Next Session.\nIf you Ever Feel the\nUrge to Create or Destroy Then YOU fit the\nBill. Interested? Then\ncontact M.J. Williamson\n616 Linstead.\nParticipation: Do Your Thing\nHere.\nFamily entertain\nAt I.C. hop last Saturday Ents. presented their star attraction of the term \u2014 The Family. About 700 people packed\ninto the Concert Hall to see one of the best live performance\nI have ever seen.\nAll except their final numbers were taken from their\ntwo L.P.s, the majority from Family Entertainment. The\ngroup started with what is becoming their standard opener:\n\"The Weaver's Answer\". This number created an atmosphere\nwhich they were to maintain throughout the evening, an\natmosphere based on the surging and unbelievable voice of\nRoger Chapman combined with the wide range of musical\ntalent expressed by the other members of the group.\nNew Constitution\n^ Continued from page one.\nThe meeting then settled\ndown to the daunting task\nof voting on the changes. The\nobjects were altered to encourage more representation\nand interest in Welfare, and\nreciprocal membership was\nmade constitutional, all un-opposed. Life members also\nlost their right to vote. The\nmove to re-name a number\nof officers vice-presidents was\ndefeated but an academic\nofficer was added. A move\nto remove constituent College Presidents was defeated.\nThe greatest excitement\ncame when the composition\nof Council was discussed.\nThe majority of present\nCouncil were opposed to an\nincrease in the size of Council and Rob Collinge, IC\nWelfare Officer, moved the\nremoval of floor reps from\nCouncil, now that there were\nto be departmental reps,\nHughes and Corr from Exec,\nsupported him but they were\nnarrowly defeated, after a recount. Also rejected attempts to remove the academic reps and later the departmental reps and finally\nAndrews' motion to add the\nHon. Pornographer of\nRSMU was heavily defeated.\nAfter some discussion of\nanomalous department reps\nthe new Council was adopted\nby 289 votes to 117.\nleaders elected democratically. As a result of the am-mended clause which was\ncarried by a large majority,\nthe President, Vice-President\nand Honorary Secretary will\nbe elected by college wide\nballot at the end of the\nSpring term (this year during\nthe summer term). Keith\nGuy, Ents chairman, successfully resisted the election of\nthe Ents Chairman passing to\nthe Union floor and Spike\nBantin, Flails rep, similarly\nretained the residence qualification for Halls' rep can di dates.\nAmid increasing points of\norder concerned with problems should the meeting become in quo rate, the chair-man, a somewhat exhausted\nbut still smiling Rex Lowin\nad jo iur ned the marathon a few minutes before four\no 'clock.\nFinally\nThe elections clause finally\nsaw ICU vote to have its\nNew Dean\nfor R.C.S. Prof. C.P. Whittingham,\nHead of the Department of\nBotany and Plant Technology, has been appointed\nDean of the Royal College\nof Science for a period of\nthree years as from 29\nSeptember 1969. This post\nis at present held by Prof.\nC.C. Butler, head of the\nPhysics Department.\n\n"

The\nfirst had little difficulty in\ndisposing of U.C. II and\nGuy's Hospital. As a result\nof an absent team and a bye the second's did not take\nto the water till 4 p.m. when,\nsuitably bloated with steak\npies and beans they found\ntheir own wind and crossed\nthe line a lap in front of\ntheir opponents.\nSunday supplied the more\nserious competition of the\nCup. In the first race cf the\nsemi - finals our second's had a spectacular victory\nover U.C.I but failed to\nmake the final by a quarter\nof a point. The honour of\nthe College was, however,\nadmirably upheld by the All\nStars despite a slight misjudgment on behalf of one\nhelmsman who was disqualified for trying to sail\nthrough the opposition\nrather than round them. In\nthe final race I.C. showed\ntheir superior boat speed\nand in the lengthening evening shadows crossed the\nfinishing line to bring the\nCup back to the college for\nthe first time in 6 years,\nmuch to the dismay of St.\nThomas's Hospital.\nTeams: John Pattisson,\nKen Barker; Nick Martin,\nPat Tiere; P. Claydon, John\nPollard.\nll's:M. Hillman, W. Davies; J. Sharp, H. Smallman; J. Brown, M. Gilligan.\nKEN BARKER\nTech.\nCup\nRCS defeated Guilds 3-2\nin the final game in this\nyear's Tech Cup and thus\nwon the cup, preventing a guilds hat - trick into the\nbargain. Both teams had to\nmake late changes in their\nline-ups, Guilds being the\nmore seriously affected.\nRCS opened strongly and\nafter 15 minutes were two\nup through Darley and Horlock. Guilds slowly began to\nrecover from this early setback and in the last twenty\nminutes of this half played\nsome good football. RCS\ndefended well, however, particularly Mountford, a last-minute substitute in their\nside.\nThe second half began\nsensationally. From Guilds\nkick-off, McCardle hit a long\nball from the centre for Keer\nto push into the RCS goal\nto make it 2-1. Play began\nto become scrappy but\nGuilds were fighting hard\nfor an equalise r. They\nfinally scored again, 10\nminutes from the end, when\nClarke hit a great shot from\njust inside the area. RCS\nrecovered well from this setback and scored the winning\ngoal three minutes from the\nend; Kelly hit a lovely\ncentre from the right and\nDarley, running in, headed\nhis second goal. RCS had\nwon a deserved if somewhat\nsurprised victory.\nGolf Club Victory\nI.C. golf club had a very\nsuccessful day last Wednesday when it won the team\nprize in the South East Universities Golf league 36 hole\nStroke Play Championships.\nThe team was: G.B. F. Henney, R. C.R. Lee, N. Goodall, and D. Leaper. The average score of 82 for the four\nplayers was exceedingly good\nconsidering the state of the\ncourse and the weather.\nThere were also individual\nsuccesses:\u2014 G. Henney won\nthe individual scratch prize\nwith two rounds of 78, 74.\nwinning by 7 strokes, and D. Leaper came second in the\nHandicap competition, and\nwas unfortunate not to win,\nbeing penal is ed1 shot for\ndriving off the wrong tee.\nThe golf club has only\nplayed 2 matches this term,\nboth against Southampton\nUniversity. In the first we\nlost, for the first time this\nyear, while in the second we\ndrew 3-3. The club has still\nnot had any joy in its search\nfor a new home, but we\nhope to have some more\ncheerful news on this subject\nat the start of next term.\nBadminton\nThe club has had only a moderately successful season\nin its league matches. With\nmost of last year's players\nleaving, the poor influx of\nfresher s was not strong enough to maintain the usual\ngood standard of badminton\nat I.C. In the league matches, the\nfirst team won 5 and lost 5,\nthe 2nds won 7 and lost 3,\nwith 3 walkover s, the 3rds won 3 but lost 6, the mixed\nteam won 8 for the loss of 2,\nwhile the ladies with one\nwalkover won 5 and lost 1.\nAlthough placings have not\nyet been announced, it is unlikely that any team will be\nhighly placed, except perhaps\nthe Ladies and the mixed\nteams.\nThe ladies are in fact our\nmost dependable team, and\nwere very successful in the\nU.L. Tournament. Lynne\nBeynan won the ladies\nsingles title, and along with\ncap a in Rosanne Date also\ntook the doubles title. Lynne\nhas also to be congratulated\nfor her selection for the British Universities Sports Federation Badminton Club tour\nof Europe this Easter,\nWith the possible demolition of Nine Elms Baths and\nthe inadequacies of the\nUnion gym for match play,\nthe club must seek new\ncourts.\nR.C.S. defeat Guilds\nto win Sparkes Cup\nBy beating Guilds 6-3 last\nWednesday the R.C.S. first\nXV won the Sparkes Cup\nfor 1969, leaving Guilds and\nMines only the Engineers\nCup to contest.\nThe pitch was atrocious\nafter two days of heavy rain\nbut at least there was no\nstanding water. The game\nbegan with Guilds on top\nterritorial ly, but with\nneither side looking like\nscoring until a very smooth\nbreakaway from within\ntheir own half by the R.C.S. backs gave Kip Connolly a good try.\nGuilds still kept up the\npressure and were justly rewarded near the end of the\nfirst half when Bell pri sed out the ball from a loose\nscrum near the R.C.S. line\nand slipped a good pass\nto Pine coming up at speed\nwho crashed his way over\nto score.\nThe second half began\nmuch the same as the first,\nand with Guilds taking even\nmore possession and terri-tory. However R.C.S. stuck\nresolutely to their job, and\ndespite two disallowed tries\nGuilds just could not score.\nFinally on the stroke of full\ntime a good passing movement along the R.C.S. line\ngave Marsh some room to\nmove and to speed in for\na try of remarkable quality\nfor these conditions.\nSo R.C.S. having beaten\nMines 5-0 and now Guilds\n6-3 won the cup.\nIn the second XV game\nR.C.S. again squeezed a narrow win through a try\nby Everett.\nThe Sparkes cup will be\npresented at the rugby club\ndinner today (March 20th). There is still time to buy a ticket for this culinary,\noratory and alcoholic ex-t rava ganza. BOB PINE\nInjury-hit I.C. win London Cross\nCountry title\nImperial College finished\nthe season on a high note\nby winning the London\nColleges' Cross Country\nLeague. The final race was\nheld last Wednesday at St.\nMary's College, Twickenham. The course was over\nfive miles of very fast grassland and the pace was very\nhot. After a mile, Nick\nBarton of I.C. was heading\nthe field and he went on to\nwin by over 200 yards. The\nI.C. team, weakened by flu\nand injury, managed to\nfinish their first and second\nteam scorers by 37th position and thus made sure of\nthe League Trophy. It was\ngood to see Barry Jones\nback in action and he is\nobviously going to make an\nimpression on British three-mi ling this summer since he\nfinished twenty-fourth on\nWednesday only a week\nafter recovering from a heel\ninjury which has kept him\nout of action for five\nmonths.\nThe second division of\nthe league was held on\nWimbledon Common and\nI.C.'s third team ran very\nwell to finish eighth out of\ntwenty-six teams. We would\nlike to congratulate Norman\nMorrison of Maths II on\nwinning the Scottish Junior\nCross-Country Championships last weekend.\n6-a side\nThe R.C.S.'
