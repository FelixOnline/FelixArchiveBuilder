But there's more to editing a newspaper than just being a nice guy.\nMy ideas for FELIX next year\nare by no means finalised, so my\nreason for outlining my plans\nnow rather than the end of term\nis to allow people the opportunity\nto offer suggestions and comment before the mould is finally\nset.\nMany second and third years I have spoken to have felt that\nFELIX has not been as exciting\nas it has been in previous years. I think half the battle in making\na publication exciting is to make\nit look more exciting. I would\nlike to be more adventurous\nthan my predecessors in terms of\nlayout and make better use of\nphotographs and illustrations. A publication with good photographs and plenty of illustrations\nis far better to read than one that\nappears as 'an u nap pet ising sea\nof grey text'. If there are any\nphotographers and cartoonists\nwho would like to turn their\ntalents to FELIX next year I would be delighted to see them.\n\"any\nfilth?\"\nThe 'Below the Belt' column\nhas had some very good moments this year, but the problem\nwith having to fill up a weekly\ntrivia column is that the material\ncan often be very weak. I would\nprefer a monthly gossip column\nwith some really juicy stories in.\nThis idea can only take off with\nyour help. Union and College\npersonalities like everyone else\nhave their own skeletons in their\ncupboards, the odd rash incident\nthey would prefer 4,500 people\nnot to know about. If you have\nany filth'on anyone well known,\nthen do drop me a line. (Rem-ember even mediocre stories can\nbe exaggerated and embroidered\na little.)\nFeature articles and reviews\nare especially enjoyable for the\nFELIX staff to do, but they can\nonly be described as self-indulgent if not enjoyed by the\npeople who read them. Many\npeople have told me they find\nthem over long and boring. I personally think this a little,\nharsh but unless I get a favourable reaction to the contrary\nthen the reviews and features\nwill have to be reduced next\nyear. What do you think?\nFELIX has set itself aside\nperhaps even aloof from its\nreaders in je cent years. FELIX\nis after all the newspaper of\nImperial College Union and\nshould not only report Union\nactivity'but promote it. Imperial\nCollege has a marvellous range\nof clubs and societies, some of\nwhich many people are unaware\nof. In an attempt to bring club\nactivity to a wider audience I would like to feature a club or\nsociety each week. I would like\nto discuss this with club captains\nand society chairmen before the\nend of term so get thinking.\n\"no strings\nattached\"\nThe puzzles section in FELIX\nhas been a very popular part of\nFELIX for several years, a tradition I would like to see\ncontinue. Pinocchio, unfortunately has moved on to other\nthings (with no strings attached?)\nso the position of puzzles editor\nis vacant. Anyone interested?\nFinally, if any of you have any\nstunningly marvellous ideas for\nFELIX next year that you feel I should know about then do get\nin touch via the FELIX Office.\nPallab Ghosh\n.L 'KE TO KEEP IN ~ .\n. ....\n:2mC GREAT\nj> SCOTT\nf THERE'S ONLY\n(L Owe THING FOR\nIf you would like Super-ed to deliver your copy of FELIX\nnext year then just fill in this coupon and send it with a. cheque for \u00a311 (payable to ICU Publications Board (FELIX)) to\nthe FELIX Office.\nName . .\nAddress\n[(\u2022May 20,19831 IPagell\n\n"

However,\nit is not enough to choose\nsomeone who is fantastically\nattractive. Personality, wit and\nintelligence are also required to\navoid the whole idea degenerating into a cattle market. Unfortunately, in my experience, there\nare no men with all the necessary\nqualities at IC. But do not\ndespair, there is someone\u2014your\ndelicious friend Mike from QEC.\nAlthough he is probably too shy\nto pose for the front page\nsuitably und re:^d, I'm still\nhoping you can use your hypnotic powers to persuade him to do\nso.\nYours in anticipation\nDiane Love\nPhysics PG\nQuis Questionet?\nDear Martin\nIn Robert Kelsey's statistics\non his so-called 'Peace Canvass\n83' in last week's edition he\nseems to have overlooked an\nimportant point concerning\nquestion five. This asks Tf there\nwas a General Election tomorrow would nuclear disarmament\nbe an important issue for you?'\nRobert states that 63% of people\nsaid yes. Yet out of the 258\nquestionnaires posted under the\ndoors of Weeks and SelkirkTizard Halls ony nine of them\nwere returned. So under 4% of\nthese' people thought that the\nnuclear issue was important\nenough to warrant filling in the\nCND questionnaire. Could it be\nthat people were saying yes to\nthe verbal questions simply to\n| get rid of the canvasser?\nYours sincerely\nNeil Stevenson\nPhysics 1\nPage 2 \u2022 HM HH1 Error-ridden\nExposition?\nDear Sir\nHaving read the article by\nRobert Kelsey in the latest\nFELIX, I feel I must write to\nanswer some of the mistaken\nand misguided statements he\nmakes. I will treat them in the\norder in which they occur:\nMr Kelsey states that an\naccidental start to a nuclear war\nis \"inevitable unless the arms\nrace is halted\". Does he have\nany idea of the vast maze of\nsafeguards, double, treble and\nquadruple checks, and agreements between people in different places that is required to\nlaunch a single missile? Evidently\nnot. The precautions are such\nthat one is almost made to doubt.\nif an intentional launch is\npossible let alone an accidental\none!\nNext, he states that \"the\nnotion that we must arm ourselves to negotiate from a 'position of strength' (that we\nmust arm ourselves to achieve\ndisarmament) is blatantly\ncontradictory\". However, he\nfails to state why it is contradictory and, indeed, he would be\nhard pushed so to do: He need\nonly think back to those long-past days at school to remember\nhow he listened to the guy of\nequal size and strength who told\nhim not to call names whilst\ngreeting similar instructions\nfrom the little weakling with\nonly more insults.\nMr Kelsey's next oversight is a mere practical detail: He\nsuggests getting rid of a proportion of our missiles unilaterally\nin order that we may 'see if the\nRussians respond' by reciprocating the gesture. What would\nhappen if, having been given,\nfree of charge, a small shift of\nthe balance of power in their\nfavour, the Russians didn't respond by giving away their\nunexpected windfall? With new\nweapons systems taking years to\ndesign and procure, we would be\nleft in a weakened position for a considerable time.\nOur friend next proceeds to\ndisplay his lack of understanding\nof Britain's independent deter-rent. After stating the obvious\nand irrelevant fact that we are\nnot an \"Imperial power\" (by\nwhich I understand him to mean\nthe country and not this college),\nhe says that Polaris and Trident\nare a waste of money as \"no way\ncould we use them without\nconsulting NATO\". Whilsfwe in\nall probability would consult\nwith NATO, the whole value of\nan independent deterrent is that\nit gives the Warsaw Pact an extra\ndecision maker to consider. Even\nI May20, if they judged that the US would\nnot take nuclear action in the\ndefence of Europe, they could\nnever be certain that Britain\nwouldn't. This is the only value\nof Polaris and Trident: In terms\nof numbers they constitute only\na tiny fraction of the West's armour y. The most blatant inaccuracy\nin Mr Kelsey's error-ridden\nexposition on nuclear arms in\nthe statement that \"the British\ngovernment has rejected suggestions of a dual-key approach\" to\nthe launch control of Cruise.\nOnly the other day I. and. if I'm not mistaken, Mr Kelsey himself,\nlistened to his friend-in-arms.\n(excuse the pun). Prof Mike\nPentz of SANA making long-winded reference to Mr Heseltine's statements on TV about\nthe ways in which dual-key\nprocedure was to be implemented. Next we have the inevitable\nand touching but irrelevant and\nincorrect reference to Hiroshima: \"Japan has no nuclear\nweapons, and they have more\nreason than any other country to\nprotect themselves from a nuclear attack.\"\nHaving proved himself ignorant of the facts in a remarkably wide range of nuclear\nissues, Mr Kelsey clinches the\ncase against himself by proving\nthat he doesn't even understand\nthe basic concept of deterrence\nbefore going on to state: \"the\nlogical extension of peace\nthrough strength is that every\ncountry in the world has nuclear\nweapons.\" Whilst I have, at\ntimes, found his reasoning just a little difficult to follow, I must\nadmit that in this case, the\nsystem of logic which he uses\ncompletely escapes me. Whilst it\nmay sound conceited to say so,\nthe NATO and Warsaw Pact\ncountries have a rather high\ndegree of political stability and\nslr on ger instincts of self-preservation and restraint than\nsome tin-pot dictatorships and\nrevolutionary juntas scattered\naround the world and are thus\nmore suitable custodians of such\nimmense power. Also, their\ncircumstances as the two main\nworld power blocs are unique\nand, thus, so are defence require-ment s. Having struggled to prove in\nthis letter that Red Rob's reasoning wasn't all it might be,\nI now see that I need n't have\nbothered: In his last paragraph,\nhe reveals the method behind his\nmadness: \"Remember your\nhumanity and forget the rest.\"\nYours sincerely\nJonathan Smith\nPhysics 2\n1 9 8 3 HH MBH Hungry Russia\nDear Martin\nIf I have correctly interpreted\nthe comments Mr Kelsey made\nin paragraph three of his article\nlast week, he regards the USA\nand USSR as acting equally\nreprehensibly in world affairs.\nHe is quite right\u2014it does depend\non where you stand. From my\nvantage point, the position is\npellucid ly clear: the Soviet\nEmpire is the enemy, not\nAmerica.\nIt's about time we realised the\ntruth about Russian foreign\npolicy Lenin declared 'war with\nthe bourg ois ie is sooner or later\ninevitable. But the enemy must\nnot know when we shall strike'.\nMore recently, Alexander Solzhenitsyn reminded us that one\naim of Soviet foreign policy is\nworld domination. Since the\n1917 Revolution, the USSR has\nswallowed Estonia, Latvia,\nLithuania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary and Afghanistan. Soviet\nclient states include such 'peace\nloving' nations as Cuba and\nVietnam, both of whom are\ncurrently conducting wars on the\nSoviet's behalf in several areas of\nthe world.\nOn the subject of The Bomb,\nlet us not forget that in the\nimmediate post-war period, the\nAmericans did not use their\nnuclear monopoly to force\nRussia to disgorge the countries\nit had swallowed in the wake of\nHitler's collapse, but when the\nUSA, in a conciliatory gesture,\nremoved all its ICBMs from\nBritain, Italy'and Turkey after\nthe 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis,\nMoscow responded by doubling\nher number of ICBMs. Similarly, when President Carter\ncancelled the Bl Bomber,\nMoscow continued to build the\nstrategic Backfire Bomber. We\nmight also ask why a largely\nlandlocked country like USSR\nneeds an enormous Navy, and\nwhy the Warsaw Pact countries\nbuilt up a massive stockpile of\nchemical weapons when the\nWest stopped manufacturing\nthem.\nI hope that these facts and\nawkward questions will help you\nto put things in perspective when\nCND's leaders next tell us about\nthe 'peace-loving' Soviet Union!\nYours controversially\nRN Monkhouse\nPS: The Papal Envoy's remarks\nabout Mgr Kent should not\ncome as any surprise. The Pope\nknows better than most, the true\nnature of life under Soviet\ndomination!\nIFELIX\n\n"

    "content": "This may be the age of computerised telecommunications, but the\nCollege telephone system is still very much dependent on\noperators %and jack plugs. Here, ace investigative reporter Jon\nBarnett looks into the eccentricities of the present system and\nspeculates on future developments.\nTime to Switch\nExchanges?\nAt a place as superbly equipped as Imperial\nCollege it can be interesting to highlight\nsome of the inadequacies which exist.\nExamples of these are the telephone\nnetworks\u2014both internal and external\u2014on\nwhich the College depends.\nJon Barnett\nOne cannot fail to notice that almost\nevery office has two telephones, one\ninternal, one external, the reason being that\nthe two networks are independent and\napparently incompatible. Let us look at the\ninternal system first.\nSouth Ken\nInternal\nEach telephone on the internal network has\na four digit number in the range 2000-4999,\nand the exchange is fully automatic. There is\nan emergency 999 facility which may be\nanswered either by the College switchboard\nor Sherfield Security (out of hours). In\naddition the system can be linked up with\nthe Silwood or Southside networks by\ndialling 6 or 0 respectively. In both cases\nonly one two-way link exists. For Silwood it\nis a rented Post Office line and for Southside\nit is a private line. College owns the main\ninternal network and rents the Southside\nnetwork, and Silwood is standard British\nTelecom.\nThis is where the fun starts. South\nKensington internal is incompatible with\nBritish Telecom, but Silwood appears to be\na variation of the Private Automated Branch\nExchange (PABX)\u2014every phone has a three\ndigit number and acts as both an internal\nand external phone. One can ring Silwood\non a BT line (Ascot 23911) and ask for any\nextension. Apparently on some Silwood\nphones one can dial 9 and get a direct BT\nline, while on the rest all one does is dial\n0\u2014the General Office\u2014and ask for one line.-So if Silwood is compatible with the South\nKensington internal and BT, why can't the\nSouth Kensington network be linked to the\nreal world?\nSome of you will have thought this over\nand are now rushing to the nearest internal\nphone in order to dial 6-9 and get a BT\nexternal line. Forget it! It doesn't work.\nNeither does dialling 6-0 and asking Silwood\nGeneral Office for a line. There is no\nindication of why this is not possible, but\nthey say it can't be done.\nSouthside\nInternal\nThere is also an internal network in\nSouthside and Linstead. This is a rented\nGEC Reliance System with an automatic\nexchange located in a tunnel under\nSouthside, as a result of which it is not\nexpected to complete its twenty year\nlifespan. Phones on this network have two\ndigit numbers and as described above, 0\npatches into the South Kensington internal.\nIt is amusing to recall that when the\nsystem was installed, the plan was to identify\nThis may look like a Science Museum exhibit,\nbut in fact the college depends on it to deal\nwith 2,000 calls a day with up to 12 operators\nworking simultaneously\neach landing telephone by landing number\u2014which is unique. Hence staircase three,\nlevel two in Falmouth Keogh\u2014landing 23\u2014\nwould have been extension 23. For some\nreason this entirely sensible idea was not\nimplemented. Landing extensions were\nnumbered sequentially instead, running up\nand down each staircase.\nApart from this little quirk, the system\nworks well, and the more imaginative\namong you will already have realised that if\nthey are visiting Silwood they can dial their\nfriends in Southside/Linstead directly from\nany Silwood phone by dialling 6-0-landing\nextension assuming both direct lines are free.\nThe only worrying aspect of this pleasant\nsystem is the rental cost of the Southside\nnetwork (around \u00a34,000) and the unknown\nmaintenance cost of the South Kensington\ninternal.\nPage 61\nExternal\nTelephones\nUntil ten years ago the College switchboard\nwas located in the Beit Building. A larger\nswitchboard was then acquired which is\nlocated in the basement of Sherfield. This\nswitchboard has a capacity for up to 2,000\nextensions, and handles up to thirty lines.\nAdditionally it is thirty years old\u2014older\nthan the unit it replaced\u2014and consists of\ntwo separate switchboards joined together.\nPart of it came originally from the\nAdmiralty and part from Buckingham\nPalace and all in all it's a bit of a mess.\nDuring one afternoon\u2014peak traffic\u2014\nthere can be up to twelve operators working\nthe board including Vi Lindfield, the\nSupervisor, and Brian Hocking, the only\nmale operator, who also tends to work on\nweekday evenings as well. They deal with\naround 2,000 calls per day.\nOne half of the board is incoming, one\nhalf outgoing. On- a busy night an operator\ncan be kept running up and down the room\ndealing alternately with incoming and\noutgoing calls, which is one reason why\nthey don't appreciate impatient 'flashers'\nwho tap the phone to get attention.\nProblems\nwith the\nlocal\nexchange\nAs if this were not bad enough, in January\nthe local telephone exchange was replaced\nwith the very latest in telephone technology.\nDays later, wreckers moved in to take the\nold equipment away. They eventually\nreached the equipment which generates dial\ntones and accounting pulses. This still had\nsome wires running into it, so out with the\nwire cutters and...Imperial College was cut\noff for a day. Our switchboard cannot talk\nMay20,1983 HH Hn^ BB HH directly to the new exchange so BT have\nbeen compelled to retain that equipment\nspecially for us. Nevertheless, a lot of calls\nare still liable to be cut off without warning.\nIt is obvious having said all this that\nImperial badly needs a new switchboard.\nA computer based system such as the\nMonarch would not just have the benefit of\nbeing more reliable and compatible with the\nlocal exchange; it is also used as an internal\nnetwork, so we could do away with both the\nSoufh Kensington and Southside internals.\nEvery telephone may be independently\nprogrammed as to what type of external\ncalls, if any, may be made from it.\nAutomatic limitations on time, especially\nfor overseas calls may be imposed.\nTelephones which are engaged can switch\ncalls through to somewhere else auto-mati call y. The specifications are fascinating.\nThe convenience of a College internal phone\non every Hall landing which could also\nindirectly receive external calls is obvious.\nThe possibilities are endless.\nWhen, Where, \u00a3?\nIt is now rumoured that in two years' time\nCollege will introduce a new telephone\nswitchboard, scrapping the South Kensington but probably not the Southside\ninternals. This will be at a basic cost of \u00a32m which is about equal to the annual College\nphone bill. Offset against this will be\nincreased savings as mentioned above\u2014\npreventing non-urgent calls before 1:00pm slashed the quarterly bill from \u00a3800,000 to\n\u00a3500,000. Far fewer operators will be\nneeded\u2014probably about four. How this cut\nwill be achieved the operators themselves\nprefer.not to discuss; it's a sour note that in\norder to introduce long overdue improvements the College will have to axe jobs.\nStill, with care and by fully exploiting\navailable facilities, Imperial may soon have\na very impressive and efficient telephone\nnetwork. Let us hope such efficiency and\norder rub off onto other areas of the\nCollege.\nKnit one, purl one-the College knitting machine in action.\n(Page7\n\n"

    "content": "Time to Call Quorum\nAt last Thursday'sU GM, various political groups threatened to call quorum and thus\nend the meeting, unless their\nmotion was discussed. Predictably, such threats were met\nwith counter-threats, until\nfinally someone, disillusioned\nwith the whole thing, called\nquorum out of disgust.\nInquoracy and procedural\nwrangling have become so rife at\nUGMs this year that the only\ncause for surprise is that such\nblackmailing tactics haven't been used sooner. No one can\ncondone the anti-apartheid\nmovement's actions in holding\nthe UGM to ransom, but we can\nand should question the U GM standing orders which make it\npossible for them to do so.\nThe trouble is that the various\nUnion hacks who run UGMs\nand deplore what they regard as\napathy in the student body have\nEDITORIAL\nlost sight of the reasons for the\nstanding orders. They have\nforgotten that the rules exists to\nensure democracy is upheld, and\nconsequently UGMs have degenerated into at fantastic and\ncomplicated game whose bizarre\nrules are comprehensible only to\na few cog nos centi. These people\nare the ones who take part in\n(and appear to enjoy) the\nprocedure at aUG M while\neveryone else might as well be\nspectators at a game of ten-dimensional chess. A lot of\npeople go to aUG M, once,\nhoping to have a say in the\nrunning of their Union Can they\nbe blamed for never going a second time?\nTo be more specific, the\nquorum rule at a meeting exists\nin theory to ensure business is\nnot conducted unless sufficient\nmembers are present. In pra c tice, because the quorum needs\nto be challenged before the\nmeeting is dissolved, and because IC UGMs are frequently\nin quo rate, the rule merely acts as\na means of giving any individual\nthe right to close the meeting at\nany time. Such a privilege is\nclearly open to abuse, as last\nThursday demonstrated.\nBut does this really need to\nbe spelt out in such detail?\nSurely it's all obvious to anyone\nwho has ever attended a UGM\n(except for the hacks who\nperpetuate the system). Either\nquorum needs to be drastically\nreduced, or (better) the standing\norders changed to prevent such\nludicrous and tedious procedural is m.

After impatiently\ndialling the number at the top of\nthe letter several times, he\neventually realised that the\nreason he kept getting the\n'number unobtainable' tone was\nthat he had been dialling the\ndate.\nThe second relates to President Goulder who became\nincreasingly annoyed and puzzled at the way the number he was\ntrying to dial was always\nengaged, Until it was pointed out\nFELIX wm s mmm mmm m^r rrr rrr rrr rrr rrr r C'Z 'ZO'.\nrrr iji c co jj jj jj.i jj jj jj j^.'.Il\" IT ilI III III?

Has the strain of the job\nbecome too much, we ask?\nSO MANY people wandering in\nand out of the FELIX Office\nhave asked me whether the\nadvertisement on page 4 is a joke\nthat I feel bound to tell you that\nit is not.

    "content": "Staggering\nConclusion\nDear Sir\nI found Mr Kelsey'^ article on\nunilateral is m somewhat con-fined. In paragraph six he\nrecommends a process of 'stag-ge red multilateral disarmament'\nas being effective. Then why in\nparagraph seven does he say that\nwe should immediately abandon\nall nuclear weapons? This is not\na particularly 'staggered' prop o sal.\nHe then states that CND does\nnot feel that NATO should\nimmediately disarm itself.\nIndeed, he implies that we would\n.be justified in trying to hide\nunder a nuclear umbrella provided by other nations, while\nnot contributing to that force\nourselves. This seems strange,\nparticularly as C ND want\nBritain to leave NATO.\nHe concludes by saying that\npeople must individually decide\nwhether 'unilateral disarmament\nby Britain would make war more\nlikely.' The only conclusion\npossible after reading his diatribe,\nis yes.\nYours multi la ie rally John Pattison\nMaths 3\nUGM wrecked\nby A A fire?\nDear Sir\nI have just left yet another\nU GM wrecked by the AntiApartheid movement, not the\nfirst occasion this has occurred.\nNo business was discussed at the\nlast UGM, or AGM of last year\nbecause A A challenged the\nquorum on opening, because\nthey were frightened of losing-i This time they tried to blackmail the U GM into accepting\nthat' their motion be heard (a similar one has already been\ndefeated this year) by threatening to challenge the quorum\nthereby preventing the elections\nfrom behing held, if this was not\nso. RSM opposed this procedural motion with the same\nthreat. Someone else decided to\nchallenge the quorum, I know\nnot his allegiance.\nWhat I am trying to say is:\nDon't these people (particularly\nA A) care about this Union? Are\nwe to have these elections\nhanging on until next year? Will\nthe same stupid and mindless\nbehaviour happen at the AGM?\nAre the members of the A A group so unconcerned about IC\ndemocracy yet so concerned\nwith South African democracy?-DP Kingston\nMaths 2\nPS: I was going to support the\nA A motion until this incident,\nhad their motion been heard I would have voted against it\nsubsequently.\nDemocracy\nat work\nDear Martin\nI was present at the SCC\nmeeting which decided to restrict\nthe number of candidates in the\nCollege's own 'General Election'\nto only those sponsored by the\nthree main political societies, not\nsurprisingly this motion was\nonly supported by those so cie ties. This prevents any other\nmember of the Union standing\nas a candidate, even though he\nmay be fully seconded etc.\nI learned at school that one of\nthe major features of a demo-c racy, which distinguished it\nfrom a totalitarian regime, is\nthat it holds elections with an\nunrestricted choice of can di dates, so that the voters can\nchoose the person they want, not\nthe person imposed upon them.\nIn Russia, elections are held but\nall the candidates are party\nmembers. It seems that Consoc,\nSocsoc and Libsoc in this unholy\nalliance have taken us closer to\ntotalitarianism by their denial of\nthe freedom of choice.\nAbstain on June 2.\nNeil D Martin\nBiochem 2\nFlat rates\ni Dear Martin\nLast week the Student Residence Committee recommended\nlarge rent rises for the Southside\npenthouse flats, claiming that\nunlike the Head Tenancies, these\nflats do not exist as a service to\nstudents but 'as a means of\nscrewing as much money out of\nthem as possible.' (I quote.)\nPerhaps it would be cynical to\npoint out that the College could\nprofit even more if it were to\nbroaden its outlook, put the flats\non the open market and screw\nmoney out of the general public\ninstead. But at least the method\nof applying for these flats could\nbe changed; this year a large\nnumber of students (myself\nincluded) wasted a lot of time\nfilling in Head Tenancy application forms for flats which are\nnow outside most undergraduates price range. If the College\nmust auction its assets, it would\nbe polite to let us know in\nadvance.\nYours\nAdrian James\nA monkey\nwrites\nDear Martin\nI must take great issue with\nyour report on the front page of\nlast week's FELIX. Not only did\nyou report the incident happening in the wrong bar on the\nwrong day but you also got the\nwrong number of people.\nIt suffices to say that all\ndisputes have two sides 40 them\nand that I am not in the business\nof making unprovoked attacks\n(physical or otherwise) on any\nperson, least of all on Mr\nGoulder. One must however\nquestion the integrity of a person\n(ie Mr Goulder) who uses the\nauthority of his position to\nfurther personal arguments.\nWe all know that as President\nof ICU Mr Goulder looks upon\nthe rank and file student as the\nscum of the earth and believes\nthat he has the same social\nstanding as God. Mr Goulder\nhas been on a year's ego trip, not\ngiving a damn for the fun loving\nstudents. When one tells him to\nget off his high-horse, stop being\npompous, and do something\nuseful, he becomes rather\nabusive and puts one on his list\nof personal enemies.\nLike so many other Presidents,\nonce elected, Mr Goulder has\ndistanced himself from students,\nkept important information\naffecting ICU secret, generally\nthinks that he has a 'cushy' job,\nand does not want to an tag on is e' College authorities by standing\nup for those who elected him.\nMr Goulder has by no means\nbeen a decent or successful\nPresident, but then what does\none expect from a man who\nthreatened to take ICU to court?\nYours sincerely\nP Simion\nDear Martin\nReports of my death (issue\n644) are rather premature.\nYours as ever\nStephen Goulder\nPrez\n-Oh I'm not so sure...-Ed\nAccommodation for Next Session\nA substantial amount of accommodation can now be\nbooked for next session.\nFlats situated in Fulham and South Ken.

Rents are from\n\u00a323-25 each per week.\nFor further details contact Student Services or ring the\nowners direct: Mr Christian 385 9882 or Mrs Belforte\n731 0292.\nNo summer retainer necessary.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE\nALDABRA\nEXPEDITION\nWANTED!\nFemale member for expedition to a coral atoll in the\nIndian Ocean this summer.\nGood grounding in biology\nessential.\nInterested?\nContact Andy Grimshaw,\nUnion Office.\nAS SOON AS POSSIBLE.\n\n"

    "content": "The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nHEALTH SERVICE\nSLAMS UNION BAR\nDr Tessa Addenbrooke of the\nCollege Health Service has\nexpressed grave disquiet over the\nstandards of hygiene in the\nUnion Bar. In a letter to\nRefectory Manager Victor\nMooney and to the Chairman of\nthe Bar sub-committee Stephen\nGoulder, she pointed out that\nthe store behind the bar is\nneither suitable nor clean\nenough when it is taken into\naccount that food as well as\ndrink is sold over the bar. She\nstressed, however, that there was\nno question of closing the bar\ndown.\nMr Goulder said that the\nmatter would receive attention\nover the quiet summer period.\nThe little-used double tuba added to the explosive orchestral forces at\nlC Wind Band's annual 1812 concert last Tuesday.\nPhoto: Kate Alexander\n\u2022 \u2022 RK a BH HH HH Friday, May20,1983 Catch 22\nThe 22 Club is to be charged a two hundred pound deposit for its\nnext formal dinner in College,\nbecause it already owes the\nrefectories over a thousand\npounds from two previous dinners.\nThe Club was formed, as its\nname suggests, in 1922 and since\nthen has gone steadily downhill.\nIts aim of 'Promoting Fellowship among past and present\nmembers of the Royal College of\nScience' is now based on various\ndinners and bar nights at which\nmembers eat (a little), drink (a lot) and are merry (all over the\nUnion Bar floor). In this it bears\na strong resemblance to Links\nand Chaps, its City and Guilds\nand RSM counterparts. Members can be recognised by a blue,\nclaret and white striped tie on\nWednesdays and slurred speech\non Fridays.\nUnion Officers expressed\nsurprise that the club's booking\nwas accepted at all, considering\nthe club is so deep in debt to the\nrefectories and to the Union\nPrint Unit. But they were\nenlightened when they discovered that not only is College\nRegistrar Peter Mee a member of\nthe club\u2014so is Refectory Manager Victor Mooney.\nBlackmail\natU GM Last week's Union General\nMeeting ground to a premature\nhalt after two separate factions\nhad threatened to call quorum\nunless they had their way.\nThe meeting was obviously\nin quo rate when Chairman Nick\nPyne opened at 1:09pm last\nThursday with an appeal to\npostpone quorum-calling until\nafter the elections for Union\nposts. But as soon as the\nOfficers' Reports had been\nmade, David Hodes demanded\nthat the Anti-Apartheid motion\nbe heard before the elections or\nhe would challenge the quorum.\nTim Williams, Vice-Presidentelect of the Royal School of\nMines Union, then said that he\nwas at the meeting to ensure that\nthis motion would not be passed,\nand threatened to call quorum if\nit was heard at all.\nIn the event, the meeting was\nclosed when the quorum was\nchallenged from another corner.\nRichard Robinson, a second-year chemist, took this step to\n'put a stop to this moral black-mail'. Mr Robinson then had to\nStephen Goulder, flan ned by\nGuilds hit squad at last Saturday's Rag Fete\nNo.6451\nbeat a hasty retreat to avoid the\nwrath of offended Union hacks;\nNick Pyne attempted to implement 'unofficial Union policy'\nby throwing him in the Round\nPond.

    "content": "PJNCCCHIO\nThis week I'm grateful for a knotty little\nproblem from Gordias.\nMotoring On\nReaders of FELIX may have missed the annual\nFEELSICK Motor Rally which occurred last\nweekend. It's very similar to the FELIX Motor\nRally which takes place later this term so I won't bore you with the details. Basically it\nconsists of teams of people rushing round\nLondon solving a treasure hunt.\nFive teams entered for the Rally, with the\nsame number of people in each team. To make\nit a little more exciting, each participant put up\n\u00a31 for prize money.\nThe total prize would be distributed\nbetween the members of the winning team,\nand each team devised a share-out scheme\nbetween its members, with each team member\n(if their team won) getting a whole number of\npounds, different from all the other members\nof the team.\nThe curious thing was that each share-out\nscheme was different to the other four\nschemes, which was only just possible.\nThe Excess team won. In this team, after the\nmoney had been distributed, it was found that\nArtful Whitewash had won the most money.\nChaste Fellow was next, followed by Steel\nGoolies and Junk MuckStallion third and\nfourth respectively. I don't remember the rest\nof the team, but Artful was pretty pleased with\nhimself\u2014he won as much as Steel and Junk\nput together.\nHow many members in each team, and what\nwas the distribution of prize money among the\nwinners?\nGordias\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me in the\nFELIX Office by Wednesday 1:00pm. \u00a35 from\nMend-a Bike for a randomly selected entry.\nLast Week's Solution\nAnything for a choi red life\nFour solutions were obtained (one of them\nfrom Bedford College\u2014thanks for the entry\nCaroline) but the winner, randomly selected\nwas Richard Glover, a Mech Eng PG, who tells\nme that there are 800 different possible\narrangements (including reflections and\nrotations), and he can collect his \u00a35 prize from\nthe FELIX Office next Monday after 1:30pm. The diagram shows one possibility\u2014the\ncrosses are one kind of chair, the blank spaces\nare the other, My thanks to Rhyno for the\ndiagram.\nRampant\nRamblings\nUnion General Mayhem\nIt's been so long since I went to a UGM, I'd really forgotten how singularly futile the whole\nthing was.\nInterestingly, perhaps the meeting is just like\nan microcosm of parliament or Dallas or\npossibly Crossroads.\nWe can see at the U GMa representative\ncross section of humanity. From the lowest,\nfawning subservient little Exec News thrower\nright up to the mighty aspiring Union despot.\nOf course, at this stage in the term, only the\nmost determined anarchists, small time\nmegalomaniacs and pathological paper\naeronautical engineers turn up.\nAt the UGM, we see the whole basis of the\nwonderful democratic British system. It symbolises all the concepts of freedom of expression,\nrule of the majority, and the vibrant student enthusiasm for self government. That's why only\nabout 3% of Imperial College turned up, although I imagine if everyone took an interest it\nwould be a trifle more embarrassing to try and fit\nthem in the Great Hall.\nNick Pyne, unaware of the seething mass of\npolitical unrest and controversy before him\nchairs the meeting like an indifferent bingo\ncaller.\nWhy the Union table insists on using a microphone stand suitable only for people\nover 7'3\" with severe spinal distortion I know\nnot. Perhaps they have aspirations in that\ndirection.\nI suppose if they didn't use a microphone it\nwould curtail the opportunity for howls of\nderision every time it fed back, thereby halving\ntheir audience.\nOn this particular occasion, the whole thing\nseemed to be progressing fairly normally with\nNick Pyne generally having his own way, and\nonly inviting questions from people whose\nnames he knew. The inimitable Steve Goulder\nshowed us all what an affected accent he can\nproduce, and everyone tried to find out what\nthe Honorary Secretary had been doing with\nhis Honorary spare time in order to justify his\nsalary.\nThen somebody tried to introduce a procedural motion. Procedural motions, I should explain, are somewhat like timetable\nalterations at Paddington. After somebody has\nintroduced one, the resulting mayhem and\nabuse from all quarters makes further useful\nbusiness impossible, and you might as well\ntake the bus home to save time.\nWith the added incentive of the prospect of\nquorum being called, Mr Pyne was forced to\nloosen his strange hold on the event (true\ndiplomacy) and everyone knew the end was\nnigh. Moments later a Miner stuck his pick in,\nas the saying goes, and threatened to call\nquorum anyway just to defeat any form of\ndemocracy which we might still be pretending\nexisted.\nIt occurs to me that if perhaps a few of our\nmining colleagues were forced to live under the\nsort of regime they use their inalienable\ndemocratic rights and freedoms to support,\nthey might have a little more respect for those\nrights.\nHowever, back at the meeting, we have just\nreached the showdown, and everything was\ngetting as exciting as can be expected, when\nsome loathsome diminutive individual, who will\ndoubtless become a social security scrounger,\na Union hack, or something equally debase,\ncalled quorum.\nSo at 1:00pm next Thursday, all the\nanarchists and megalomaniacs and Exec News\nthrowers will file into the Great Hall\nRhyno\nWALHABOUTV\nlOOK St tV by Mobile Optics lac.\nLocal Titbits\nThe two small galleries 1 visited this week are\nwithin ten minutes walk of College.

It's all the more\nreason for dropping in, regularly, to see a handful of really super pictures in surroundings more reminiscent of an elegant drawing\nroom than a national museum.\nCurrently, you will find Ben Nicholson\u2014\nmottled colours, and forms and lines which\ncasually meet, overlap and interact to animate\nthe picture\u2014Edgar Degas\u2014a generously\nproportioned nude\u2014and Pablo Picasso\u2014in\n'Homme et femme nus deb out'(1969), she is\npink and green like Brighton rock with a classically beautiful profile; he is plump arid\nundecided, a hero of Greek mythology in\nunheroic middle-age.\nNew Art Centre\nExhibitions of Mary Potter's(19001981) work\nhave been held regularly at the New Art\nCentre since 1967. Currently, some sixty of\nher watercolours are on show there. The\nmajority date from after her move from\nLondon to Aldeburgh in 1951 and depict the\nobjects in her studio and the Suffolk\nlandscape. The beaches are cool and grey; a luminous mist drifts over water in the early\nmorning and impressionistic trees emerge\nhazily from it.\nThese are the most successful pictures.\nWhere Mary Potter paints vegetation in crisp\nlines and deeper tones it sits rather uneasily\nagainst the soft washes of the middle ground.\nHer figures\u2014fishermen and children\u2014and her\nfishing boats are delicately drawn; the shrubs\nand weeds are less accurately observed.\nPrices for these watercolours start at \u00a3200\nand three have been reproduced as large\npicture postcards at 15p each.\nWhere?

    "content": "INEWSI\nGrimwash\nSnubbed\nJonathan Miller is to act as\nUnion President during Stephen\nGoulder's absence later this\nterm. At a meeting last week the\nUnion Executive offered the\nActing Presidency to Mr Miller,\nwho is currently chairman of\nJonathan Miller\nSocial Clubs Committee, during\nMr Goulder's absence in Holland between May 29 and June\n3.\nThe Executive's decision is an\nunusual one, in that normally\none of the other sabbatical\nofficers or a Constituent College\nUnion President would be asked\nto de put is e for the ICU President. At this time of year,\nhowever, the CCU Presidents\nhave exams, and the Executive\n(which consists of the Union\nPresident, Vice-President,\nHonorary Secretary and the\nC CU Presidents) apparently\npreferred not to offer the job to\nthe year's Hon Sec Andy Grimshaw.

However,\ndespite the best efforts of all concerned, I'm afraid the experiment was to my eyes a failure.\nI didn't laugh and I didn't cry. The overlay of\ntragedy made the humour ring hollow and the\nwavering s of the relationship between the two\nMoores diffused the focus of the tragedy of the\nyoung girl's death. In making you try to feel\nsorry for everyone in the film\u2014the girl, the not\nso hard hearted business woman mother, the\nfriend who is torn between them and his own\nfamily, his wife and their son\u2014you end up not\nreally caring about anyone in particular. It is a pity about this, as; otherwise the film was\nfaultless, except perhaps the little girl was\nrather miscast (or are pre co ci us or 'cute' kids\nmeant to engender sympathy? This one rather\nturned my stomach.) A major plus is the\nmusic, written and performed by Dudley\nMoore himself and, for a change, he resists the\ntemptation to tinkle the ivories on screen\ndespite the odd Steinway plo nk ed here and\nthere. Obviously aimed at kids for the summer\nholi ay, I'm sure they'll love it if they can be\npersuaded that they don't want to see Return\nof the Jedi again (which opens in a couple of\nweeks).\nAs a real bonus for all you budding\nengineers out there, as a short playing with it is\nToiuer Over London U all about the building of\nthe NatWest Tower. Now if I thought Six\nWeeks was a 'Dud', this is the most dismal\u2014I mean it it really bad. From the terrible title\nthrough the awful soundtrack to the shots of\njolly bulldozers, all I can say is perhaps we\nwere abetter off with the bloody gondolas!\nFELIX BH HH HH Honkytonk Clint\nMoving quickly along now to the new Clint\nEastwood film Honkytonk Man 15 which also\nstars Kyle, Clint's son. Set in the depression in\nAmerica, it is about honky tonk singer Red\nStovall (Clint Eastwood) and his relationship\nwith his nephew Whit (Kyle Eastwood).\nRed has an invitation to audition for every\ncountry singer's dream, the Grand OP Oprey\nin Nashville and sets off in his aged limo to\nmake the trip from California. He stops at his\nsister Emmy's on the way and the family\ndecide to let Whit go with his uncle, whom he\nidol is es, as a way of keeping uncle out of\ntrouble. It's a somewhat thin excuse I suppose,\nbut fourteen year old Whit proves a steadier\nhand on the wheel than his hard drinking\nuncle. Grandpa decides to go along as well for\nthe ride and for various reasons they pick up\nan additional pass anger along the way. Thus\nwe have a slow paced road movie of great\ncharacter with Clint in good form as the hard,\nindependent but sensitive country singer and\nKyle turning in a remarkable debut performance of real charm. However, this is\napparently the week for tragedies and this time\nit's Red who is being beckoned by the grin\nreaper. All this hard living has taken its toll and\nhe is dying from consumption and his try out\nfor the Ol' Oprey is his last chance to leave\nsomething behind when he's gone. This gives\nthe film its final polish\u2014this time the tragedy\nworks because we see a apparently all\npowerful, self-sufficient and in control have his\ndestiny decided for him, and this is his last\nattempt to cheat his fate. Although it might be\npossible to carp about the pedestrian pace and\nthe lack of tension or dramatic twists, the film\nhas great charm and is deliberately downbeat\nthroughout. It is really seen through the eyes\nof the nephew; it is his coming to man hod( nudge, nudge, wink, wink) and a time when he\nlearns to be quick witted and find inner\nstrength, and take the first steps toward\nfollowing in the steps of his uncle.\nNot by any means the best Clint Eastwood\nfilm, but then that's no real criticism. This man\ncontinues to be on e of the biggest box office\ndrawers around and rightly so. There's a lot of\ngood country and western/blues music in the\nfilm for those of you who like that sort of thing,\nbut fortunately not of the bland Dolly Parton\nvariety.\nAlso recently released is Androids,the new\nKlaus Kinski picture which I haven't got\naround to seeing, but I have it on good\nauthority that it is well worth a visit, even if you\nare not an avid SF fan. I'm sorry I can't tell you\nmore, but I have certain pressing engagements\nahead and I can't see everything. I tend to\nsteer clear of Sci-Fi flicks on the pretext that\nwhen you've seen one spaceship blowup\nyou've seen 'em all, but I obviously was\nmistaken about this one.\nAnd that's all from me for the next week or\ntwo; I simply can't afford the time for reviews\nso I 'll be back after my exams and would like to\nwish all fellow sufferers good luck!\nLee Paddon\nI May20,19831 I Page9\n\n"

The film portrays the initial\nhostility and persecution which greeted the\nemergence of the religion. It was this\npersecution which forced the believers to\nemigrate to Medina. Revelations at Mecca and\nMedina dealt with both personal affairs and\naffairs of state. The religion flourished due to\nthe preachings of the prophet and the\nbelievers as well as the example set by the life\nof the prophet. The film goes on to portray the\nconsolidation of the new faith against\nenormous odds and the inevitable victory of\ntruth over falsehood and ignorance.\nREVIEWS!\nBook:\nSlowly Down The\nGanges\nby Eric Newby,\nPicador Books, \u00a32.50.\nDrop any normal man, his wife, and a vast\nquantity of baggage in a foreign country, at the\nsource of a large river, and tell him that, using\nthe remaining smattering of a language he\nlearnt twenty years earlier, he is to transport\nhimself and his accoutrements 1,500 miles\ndown river using only country boats, and he\nwould probably exit this world instantly, a victim of cardiac arrest.\nHowever, if the man is Eric Newby, the river\nthe Ganges and the language Hindi, we can\nexpect another chronicle along the lines of his\nearlier book A Short Walk In The Hindu Kush,\nand indeed, this expectation is fulfilled in\nSlowly Down The Ganges.\nThe journey he describes is, by mortal\nstandards, fairly insane, and those who have\nsome experience of India will understand when\n1 say that Newby is firmly amongst the 'mad\ndogs and Englishmen' who alone go out in the\nmidday sun. Not only does this incredible\ntraveller achieve his target with his Italian wife\nWanda, but in doing so he records the journey\nin the finest possible detail.\nBeginning their journey at Hardwar with the\nmajor, if unsurprising, discovery that the river\nis at a low ebb in December, the dry season,\nthe couple manage to hire a boat and boatmen\nto begin the painful early stages of the journey.\nSTOIC\nHave you ever thought that there must be\nmore to life than working, drinking and\nmasturbation? Whenever I think that a voice\nusually replies, 'no, but if you watch STOIC\nnext week we might just prove that there is.\nThe highlights (and in some cases low lights) of\nthe last year have been condensed into a special series Turn It On Again', starting next\nThursday; and now that our film reviewer has\nbeen retrieved from Wardour Street we are\nalso showing 'Films of the Year' or another\nchance to reflect on some of the biggies you\nmissed first time round. That's about all I can\nthink of at the moment, but keep watching\u2014it\nmay happen.\nCND\nThis weekend is the Christian CND national\ndemonstration at Upper Heyford in Oxfordshire. (Upper Heyford is one of the main US\nbases for the Fill nuclear bombers; there has\nbeen a peace camp there for over a year.)\nThere will be witness, a festival and worship: a march on Saturday, torchlight vigil throughout\nthe night a dawn Whitsun service, theology\nand non-violent direct action workshops on\nSunday, and some kind of action on Monday.\nThe West London Chaplaincy and Cath Soc\nhave organised transport. Phone me tonight\n(286 9048) if you want to go.\nBetween Tuesday May 31 and Friday June 3\nthere is a four-day blockade of Upper Heyford\nWe are at this point treated to an account of\nthe lives of the holy men at Hardwar, who exist\nin abundance. Having eventually managed to\nshove, drag and carry their boat fifty miles\ndownstream to water deep enough to float it\nin, the journey proper begins, and from now on\nthe story is not so much that of an extended\nboating trip as a detailed, authentic account of\nlife on the banks of the Ganges seen through\nthe eyes of a sympathetic, discerning and\nintelligent observer.\nFrom Hardwar to Calcutta via Kanpur,\nAllahabad, Banares and Patna, Newby's descriptions of the people, and the places they\npass through are excellent and the numerous\nancient buildings and ruins are given\nperspective by frequent historical and\nmythological asides. Indeed, for those more\ninterested in this side of India there is plenty of\nmaterial here, though my own preference is for\nthe more mundane human contacts described.\nThese I found to coincide very accurately with\nmy own experience of this amazing country.\nThe one serious complaint I have about\nS/ ou;/y Down The Ganges is the lack of decent\nphotographs. The dozen or so it contains are\nfairly ordinary and could be taken from any\nunexciting travel guide. They do not really\ncomplement the written material, and leave\nmuch room for improvement.\nIf there is one phrase in the book which\nsums up everything in it, it is when Newby\ndescribes himself as 'a typical traveller in India,\n' at one moment elevated by the splendour of\nthe country; the next cast down by its\nmiseries'. I think Newby is being modest in\ndescribing himself as a typical and his account\nenhances the spend our, whilst faithfully yet\nsympathetically including the miseries too.\nI unreservedly recommend Slowly Down\nThe Ganges to anyone interested in India.\nPeter Dias-Lalcaca\nUSAF Base (again). The peace blockade is\ndivided into six shifts, with London region\ntaking part from midnight until 6:00pm on\nFriday June 3. NVDA training is required\nbeforehand: there are plenty of opportunities\nfor this in London. Contact me if you want to\ntake part.\nRobert Kelsey\nCiv Eng 3\nTO Soc\nThere were rumours, he had heard them,\nwhispers across the sea. On the wind, over the\nland, through the electrified barbed-wire\nfences, past the weapon ed dug-outs to the\nsubterranean steel bunker where they ate.\nThey had failed, the soundless words said.\nDoctor X swallowed, and stared around the\ntable. The others seemed not to hear. The\nsecret was out though how he didn't know.\nWhat the two world powers would do with the\nelastic he couldn't say, but he and the others\nwere no longer safe with the knowledge of\nStark's discovery.\nX felt a pain in his stomach. Indigestion? It\nintensified. Others were clutching their\nstomachs around the table. Poison? And then\nhe realised the truth as he choked, throwing\nup blood across the table and screaming\nincoherently as the agony ripped through him.\nHe exploded, intestines, stomach and liver\nbursting from his abdomen along with a small\nblack ball. The others collapsed in shreds as\nthe tiny balls, like children's power balls, exited\nfrom their stomachs and ricochetted around\nthe room.\nVictor Moony\nPage 81 I May20,19831 Not content with his portrayal of a 'trick\ncyclist' in Lovesick, our Dud treats us to\nPatrick Dalton the would-be politician in his\nnew film Six Weeks PG directed by Tony Bill\nat the Leicester Square Theatre. It also stars\nMary Tyler Moore, just to confuse you, and\nKatherine Healy as her precocious daughter.\nMr Moore is running for congress. Now in\nAmerica it is rare that the guy with the best\nideas wins, more usually the victor is the man\nwith the most money to spend on slick\ncampaigning, the ultimate example of this\nbeing that most presidents are millionaires\nwith an entrenched interest in the status quo\nand no understanding of the word 'poor'.\nAnyway, enough politics: he needs money.\nCharlotte Drayfus (Mary Tyler Moore)\nhappens to own a large cosmetics firm and\nhence has plenty. She decides to help his\ncampaign for the sake of her daughter who has\ntaken a shine to Mr Dalton. The title refers to\nthe young lady's life expectancy due to\nleukemia, and in this short period Dud gets\ndrawn into this close relationship as it heads\ntowards its tragic climax.\nThis film is obviously a departure from Mr\nMoore's more slapstick humour into that old\nHM HRH Mn n FELIX "
