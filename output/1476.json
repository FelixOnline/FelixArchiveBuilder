    "content": "T\nwo o\u2019clock in the morning. I had\ngot home from an amazing night\nout and was falling asleep when I\nheard people running in the corri-dor. It was a Friday night and we\nwere Freshers, so I thought nothing of it; I turned\nover and pulled the duvet tighter around me.\nLiterally seconds later I was woken from my\ndoze by the sound of loud, unnatural thump\naccompanied by splintering wood. I sat bolt\nupright. Listening intently I couldn\u2019t hear anything other the muffled sounds of people talk-ing. Humph. I decided that I wasn\u2019t getting up;\nthey\u2019d woken me up and I didn\u2019t want to get\ninvolved if they\u2019d broken something!\n10 minutes later, I was blissfully slipping into\nsleep when I was woken yet again by people\nrunning down the corridor. This time I marched\nto the door, and violently threw open my door,\nready to give whoever it was an earful. However, I was stopped in my tracks when I came\nface to face with paramedics sprinting along\nthe corridor and disappearing into my friend\u2019s\nroom, only metres from my own. I felt sick,\nand very almost was; I knew immediately that\nsomething awful had happened.\nI can remember stupid details from that night\nso vividly, the smell of the wooden doorframe I\nleaned against and the pyjamas I was wearing as\nI stood shaking in my doorway whilst each second ticked slowly by. Some agonising minutes\nlater, I saw one of my closest friends stretchered\npast me. It was then I learned that he had tried\nto hang himself. The splintering noise from earlier was people breaking down his door, and the\nmuffled voices were them saving his life.\nI didn\u2019t go back to sleep that night; I sat cold\nand shivering on the foot of my bed, with a\nmultitude of emotions that running through me.\nThat night was 6 years ago, as I was approaching the end of my first term at university, but it\nis etched into my memory forever.\nMy friend was lucky; he survived, and after\nconfronting his issues is actually one of the happiest people I know today. Unfortunately, this\nis not an uncommon story; many people have,\nor know friends with, mental health issues. The\nTimes recently reported that the University of\nCambridge was reviewing its counselling provision after this term saw the highest rate of suicide at the university for over a decade. However, Cambridge has one of the best counselling\nservices among the UK\u2019s universities.\nThe Oxford Centre for Suicide Research has\npublished papers showing that suicides rates are\nhighest in the 18 to 21 demographic, the very\ndemographic that makes up the majority of university students. The centre highlighted the fact\nthat student life is a period of transition. However ready someone feels to move away from\nhome, there are significant changes that occur.\nTime spent as a student is an \u2018in-between pe-FEATURE\nFELIX\n10\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nriod\u2019 in life; you transition from depending on\nyour family for many things including money to\nfully fledged independence. And this whole period is time-limited; you have to make the most\nof what you can and everything is all orientated\nto an end-goal, a degree and \u201cthe passport to the\nnext stage in life.\u201d Caught up in this world of\npractical, social and academic challenges, combined with the often \u201crisky behaviour\u201d associated with student living and the learning process,\nthe stresses and strains that can take their toll.\nThe reported suicides of Cambridge students\nalso highlights a perceived problem amongst\nhigh performing universities such as Imperial.\nIt is therefore important to note that despite the\nmedia\u2019s opinions, the centre found that \u201ccontrary to earlier findings and popular belief,\nsuicide rates in Oxford and Cambridge University students do not differ from those in other\nyoung people.\u201d\nUniversities across the board therefore all\nhave a responsibility to look after the mental\nhealth of their students. But what makes some\nstudents more vulnerable than others? Is this\nsimply random, or is it something to do with\nthe kind of personalities universities attract?\nProfessor Laycock, Head of Medicine Years\n1 and 2, suggests that it is not, deeming our\nstudents to be \u2018highly competitive\u2019, who tend\nto \u2018consider everything much more seriously\u2019\nthan other young people.\nMental health problems within the medical\nschool are common, although many conditions\ngo unreported. This week, Felix spoke to Dr\nMike Schachter, Senior Welfare Tutor for the\nmedical school. He believes the problem to be\nwidespread across the UK, and not more prevalent in Imperial. \u201cThere is no national comparison but in my own experience of a number of\nother [medical] schools the percentage here is\nsimilar to other places in the UK.\u201d\nWhilst Imperial might not have a medical\nschool less mentally healthy than other medical schools in the UK, the same might not be\nable to be said about other colleges and universities across Britain. The type of personality\nuniversities attract might have something to do\nwith this. The concept of personality types is\na modern and often controversial one. In the\n1950s, the idea of \u2018Type A and Type B\u2019 personality first emerged, and has remained in popular\npsychology ever since.\nType A personalities are the \u2018stress junkies\u2019\nof this world. They are highly ambitious, highly competitive and often workaholics: a type of\nperson arguably not uncommon at a university\nlike Imperial. Type B personalities, conversely,\nare easy going, relaxed and unhurried \u2013 people\nwho possibly wouldn\u2019t cope with the intensely\ncompetitive environment Imperial creates.\nType A personalities, so the theory goes, are\nmuch more likely to experience problems with\nmental health, as well as heart disease.\nThe idea of personality typography is very\ncontroversial, with much of the scientific world\nshunning its credibility. Many believe that the\nhuman condition is far too complex to be neatly\nsorted into two categories. Of course, nobody\ncan deny that students at Imperial are highly\ndriven, ambitious individuals. This drive to\nsucceed will of course put added pressure on\nthe individual, contributing to possible mental\nhealth issues.\nThe most important thing to remember that\none mental health disorder is not the same as\nanother. Mental health issues encompass a\nwide range of conditions affecting a person\u2019s\nemotions and well-being. There is difference\nbetween \u2018anxiety and worry about exams\u2019,\nand more serious disorders such as depression\n(the most common psychological problem experienced by Imperial students). Perhaps the\nhigh-pressure environment that Imperial offers\ncould cause students to feel anxious, but nobody can seriously suggest that such an environment can be a sole cause of depression (or\nany other mental health issue \u2013 after all the vast\nmajority of Imperial graduates are well-adjust-ed, healthy individuals). Depression is a complicated illness, with many interplaying facets,\nincluding genetics and predisposing factors\n(possibly personality type), as well as stressors\nand life events. High-pressure environments\nmay exacerbate a problem that already exists.\nMental illness is probably more common\namong your peers then you think, but there is\nstill such a stigma attached to having a mental\nillness that people still refrain from discussing\nit openly. As Rethink, a mental health charity,\nexcellently defines it, \u201cStigma is something\njudged by others as a sign of disgrace and\nsomething that sets a person apart from others.\u201d\nWhen something such as mental illness is\nstigmatised, the issues will be avoided. This\nsilence, and unwillingness to understand the\nproblems, often makes people feel ashamed,\nand sometimes prevents people from seeking\nhelp or even admitting they have a problem. It\nis important that people address their issues.\nMy friend felt he couldn\u2019t be open and approach someone about his problems. He could\npad down the corridor, duvet wrapped around\nhim, to come and sit on the end of my bed and\ngossip about menial things but he couldn\u2019t tell\nme about his inner demons. Overcoming the\nstigma of mental illness will be a challenge,\nbut increased openness and understanding will\nhelp prevent a repeat of those events which\noccurred 6 years ago.\nLet\u2019s be more open\nabout mental illness\nSlobodan Radosavljevic\nLizzie Crouch on the stigmas often\nattached to mental illness\n\u201cHigh-pressure environments\nmay exacerbate a problem that\nalready exists\u201d\nImperial provides a range of support for students.

    "content": "20\nCOMMENT\nfelix\nFRIDAY 03 decEMBER 2010\nS\no says Bradley Manning,\nthe US soldier working as\nan intelligence analyst in\nBaghdad.\nThe rights and wrongs of\nthe situation are irrelevant. The information is out there. This particular can of\nworms has been opened. Thanks to innovations like the internet and microchips\nwhich allow us to store huge amounts\nof information on a tiny memory stick,\nhacking into systems and disseminating\ninformation from them has never been\neasier. Because of this, we face a flood\nof information from Wikileaks.\nBut we also face the same onslaught\nfrom more legal means from the Freedom of Information act. Institutions\nare obliged to release information upon\nrequest.\nSupposedly this access to previously\nclassified information acts as a democratic leveller. Any public institution\nfaces having its authority undermined\nby leaks of information which might\ndiscredit their members or shed a less\nthan flattering light on their practises.\nSo if these leaks are inevitable for all\nwalks of life, should they be filtered?\nThe original leaked memos are all available on the internet, but how many\npeople have actually read them? Most\nof us will have gained what information we have about the contents through\nthe newspapers. We only hear about the\nthings they choose to tell us, and only\nget the spin they choose to put on it.\nThe problem with reading these docu-ments, is that both journalists and the\ngeneral public are often poorly equipped\nto understand the linguistic nuances pre-sent, and in addition these documents\nare being viewed out of context, and not\nin terms of the background from which\nthey arose. A main point of controversy\nabout the recent leaks was Hilary Clinton asking diplomats to monitor UN of-ficials, but, it has been argued that these\ninstructions are not meant literally, and\nthat diplomats would know the differ-ence. As a Science Communication\nstudent, this reminded me of the issues\naround science reporting that we confront daily.\nWhen covering science stories, journalists are faced with jargon and lan-guage, which is meaningful to the experts using it, but to a non-specialist, is\neasily misinterpreted.\nOne recent example would be one of\nthe emails pounced upon by the rightwing press in the aftermath of the University of East Anglia \u2018climategate\u2019\nemail fiasco, which, like the wikileaks\nof recent days, involved technological\nfoul play, and leaking of emails between\nresearchers. Several groups maintained\nthat these emails manifested genuine\nevidence of scientific malpractice, basing their claims around one email which\nreferred to \u2018Mike\u2019s Nature trick\u2019. While\nwe often think of a \u2018trick\u2019 being devious\nor subversive, in fact this trick was simply a statistical technique used by Mike\nHulme, director of the Tyndall centre for\nclimate research, to unify two different\ndata sets.\nThe link here is that leaks have revealed how the scientific and the diplomatic worlds function. The degree of\nsecrecy and separation that existed be-Facing a Wikiflood\ntween the public and these institutions\ngave them authority, but a peek into\ntheir inner workings make them seem\ngrubby and corrupt.\nPerhaps if they were a bit more\nopen to begin with, the issues of leaks\nwouldn\u2019t exist, and we might respect\ntheir openness. Perhaps. But we probably wouldn\u2019t have as much faith in their\ncompetence. Either way, I have more\nfaith in the institutions the leaks are\ncoming from than the journalists who\nare interpreting them.\nThe likelihood is that we face an information arms race, as the US shuts down\naccess to lower levels, and implements\nmore and more sophisticated firewalls\nand anti-hacking devices. But there will\nalways be disgruntled employees all the\nway up who are willing to leak informa-tion, and there will always be someone\ncapable of hacking these systems. So if\nthis leaking of information is inevitable,\nis an honest approach a better one, as it\nrelies less on media spin?\nInformation should be free, and it\ndoes belong in the public domain. But\nthat means we have to be extra careful\nwith how we interpret it. It may seem\nthat the papers are just laying open the\ntruth to the public, but just by selecting\nwhich information to report, journalists,\nwhether meaning to or not, will always\nreport with a certain bias.\nThese wikileaks are turning into a\nwikiflood. How we direct the flow of\ninformation is up to us.\nThe memos released by Wikileaks are part of a wave of\ninformation. But what are we going to do with it?\nThis coming Thursday will be an important\nday for students all across the country. Parliament will vote on controversial proposals\nto raise the cap on tuition fees to \u00a39,000.\nFor the Editors of this newspaper the day is\nalso important for another, albeit more light-hearted, reason. It will be 61 years to the\nday since the first issue of Felix was pub-lished. It is Felix\u2019s birthday.\nThe paper is now almost completely unrec-ognisable, in terms of its design and produc-tion, to that first issue. Throughout the decades the various students who have had the\nprivilege of editing the paper have taken bold\ndecisions with regard to its appearance. In\nfact the only connection, superficially speak-ing, that the paper has to that first issue\nis the logo. The same Cat that smiled out\nat students on Friday the 9th of December\n1949, now smiles out at students in 2010.\nHowever, despite the changes in appear-ance, the character and ethos of the paper\nhave remained consistent. The aims and\nobjectives laid out by the first Editor of the\npaper, E.M. Hughes, are still the aims and\nobjectives that the team hold in 2010. \u201cTo\ncomment upon the affairs of the College\nwhilst they are still topical\u201d, he wrote in that\nfirst Editorial; that is certainly still our aim.\n\u201cAny contribution will be welcome\u201d, he de-clared; that is still the guiding ethos of this\npaper. \u201cThe success or failure of this paper\ndepends principally upon you, our readers\u201d,\nhe noted; the current Editors of the paper\nstill firmly believe this to be true.\nWe have been especially fortunate this year\nin the number of talented students that have\ngiven up their valuable free time to contribute to the paper; time that they perhaps\nshould have used to complete lab reports\nor catch up on lectures . At a university\nwhere proficiency with equations and lab reports is valued more highly than the ability\nto write, the fact that almost 200 students\nhave already chosen to get involved with the\nstudent publication speaks volumes for the\nrange of talents at this university.\nBut although we take pride in the achievements made so far, we are ever aware of\nwhere we have failed to meet the high standards set by our predecessors. And because\nof that we are always open to criticism and\nnew contributors. E. M. Hughes really hit the\nnail on the head when he said that this paper relies upon you, the reader. Without you,\nthis paper would be nothing.\nFELIX\nGeorge Wigmore\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nFor a 61-year-old,\nyou do swear a lot,\ndon\u2019t you Felix?\nIn this information age, Julian Assange holds the balance of power, not the government\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cInformation should\nbe free.

    "content": "FELIX 11\nFEATURE\nHow much support does Imperial provide?\nT\nhere are three main places\nthat you can initially seek out\nhelp:\nThe Student Counselling Service\noffers free, confidential counselling\non a short term basis to all students of Imperial College London.\nIt is found at South Kensington,\nHammersmith and Silwood Park\nCampuses. Appointments can be\nmade by calling 020 7594 9637,\nemailing counselling@imperial.\nac.uk or by going to reception on\nLevel 4, Sherfield Building, South\nKensington Campus.\nThe Imperial College Union Advice\nCentre is a confidential centre independent from the college, designed to give advice on all sorts of\nwelfare issues, including personal\nsafety, sexual health, alcohol and\ndrug issues. The Centre is located\nin the Union building (mezzanine\nlevel.) It is open 10am-5pm Monday to Friday.\nThe Imperial College Health Centre provides 24 hour care for NHS\nregistered students in conjunction with the local afterhours GP\nservice. It is found at 40 Princes\nGardens, by the South Kensington\nCampus. As well as general medical care (including mental health\nissues) students can get help with\nstress and study difficulties. Students can also gain access to a\nConsultant Psychiatrist, part-time\nCounsellors, Psychotherapists and\nPhysiotherapists via referral from a\nmember of medical staff.\nProfessor Denis Wright, Dean of\nStudents at Imperial, oversees the\nWelfare Services at Imperial. What\ndoes he think of the services available to Imperial students? \u201cHopefully it\u2019s getting better, and I think\nit\u2019s pretty good now.\u201d\nUntil last year, the number of\ncounsellors at Imperial\u2019s Counselling Service had been consistently\nquite low. This was reflected in a\nratio of 1 counsellor to 4375 stu-dents. This ratio was well below the\nAssociation for University and College Counselling\u2019s recommended\nratio of 1:3000, as well as ratios\nseen at other universities. Although\nhe has no control over our NHS run\nhealth centre, Professor Wright\nmade a bid to increase number of\ncounsellors available to students\nby increasing their numbers at the\nCounselling Service. \u201cNow we have\na much healthier [ratio], but I\u2019d still\nlike it to be higher,\u201d said Professor\nWright.\n\u201c[The increase in number of coun-sellors] was in spite of the fact I\nhad to make a 5% cut in the welfare budget. So I actually put more\nmoney into disabilities and counselling,\u201d he explained, \u201cWe don\u2019t\nknow what the [spending] cuts will\nbe like, but I\u2019m certainly going to\ndefend [these changes] to the hilt.\u201d\nWhen I asked whether these services are vital to Imperial, he replied\nsimply \u201cWell I think so.\u201d\n\u201cDemand for counselling is increasing slowly but steadily.\u201d It\u2019s\ndifficult to pin down a specific reason for this increase; it could be\ngreater publicity about the services\noffered at Imperial, greater anxiety\nabout jobs, or a multitude of other\nreasons.\nWhat is Imperial\u2019s recommendation if you have a problem? \u201cPlease\ngo and see somebody.\u201d The help\nis there from different people\nthroughout Imperial; the wardens in\nyour halls, your personal tutor and\nthe confidential Student Counselling Service are just a few that are\nthere to help.\nLiving with depression in the family\n\u201cI tore myself to pieces because I couldn\u2019t be perfect\u201d\nA\nsecond year undergraduate\nspoke to Felix about his life\nwith mental illness. He has suffered with a diagnosed mental health\ndisorder in the past, and still battles\nwith the aspects of the disorder to this\nday.\n\u201cWhen I was 14, I started self harming.\nI didn\u2019t do it very often. It kind of [hap-pened sporadically] around until I was\n18 and half,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe way I\nsaw it was that self harm was a way to\ncope with how I felt inside. I didn\u2019t like\nmyself and I didn\u2019t like what I did. I\u2019m\nvery critical of myself. If something\u2019s\nnot done perfectly, it\u2019s not good enough.\nAnd so self-harm was a way of punishing myself. I\u2019d sit there and just look at\nit. I used to sit there stroking them as a\nreminder that I\u2019d done this to myself and\nthat this was my punishment.\u201d\nIt was just before his 19th birthday\nthat he \u201cstarted having panic attacks\nabout [his] mortality,\u201d and approached\nhis own doctor in search of something\nthat might help. However, even after being put on antidepressants, he got progressively worse. \u201cI was self harming a\nfew times a day, to quite bad levels. I\nwas crying all day, I could barely get out\nof bed. I would sit in a corner all day\nlooking out into space.\u201d\nEventually he was sent to a psychiatrist\nwho assessed him. In less than a year, he\nsaw a few different psychiatrists and at\none time was on 10 pills a day. Life is\nnow significantly better but he still struggles occasionally. \u201cI\u2019m repeating the second year because I couldn\u2019t deal with it\nlast year. I tore myself to pieces because I\ncouldn\u2019t be as perfect as I wanted to be. I\nknow I cant attain perfection, I won\u2019t get\n100% in every exam but you do look at\nthe people around you, and [sometimes]\nyou can\u2019t attain their levels.\nWhen I asked whether he talks openly\nabout his mental health, he replied, \u201cMy\npolicy is if somebody asks, I won\u2019t lie. I\nT\nhe worst thing about thinking\nabout my sister is that I automatically associate her with depres-sion. My most loved one cannot find\nany value in life, so much so that being\nalive is a dread she faces everyday and\nthe thought of death is her only comfort .\nI cannot help but feel guilty for writing this article, I feel like I am exposing\na shameful secret, even though I know\nI\u2019m not. Despite a modern acceptance of\nits prevalence, there remains an unconscious stigma that won\u2019t be shaken off.\nWhen my family found out, her diagnosis came with news that she tried to\ntake her own life. We each felt differently\nabout what happened. My parents, from\na different culture, put her \u201cstupidity\u201d\ndown to the fact that she must have been\ndisheartened due to her drop-out from\nuniversity \u2013 not comprehending that this\nwas a result and not cause of depres-sion. They still don\u2019t even understand\nwhat depression is. My eldest sibling\nbelieved that she needed to be distracted\nand doesn\u2019t understand why she doesn\u2019t\nagree that she should try to get better.\nI felt broken having nearly lost my\nsister but what is worse is constantly\ndreading a phonecall confirming what\nnearly happened, because with depression there is no getting better. There is\nonly being able to cope or not.\nThe biggest shock was the impact of\nher depression on my life. This happened during my overwhelming first\nyear at Imperial. Aside from distracting\nme from studies, I suddenly felt more\nisolated than I already was.\nwon\u2019t hide the truth. The way I see it, is\nthat this has happened to me and this is\npart of who I am. If you want to know me\nfor who I am and this comes up, then you\naccept it. If you don\u2019t, then tough.\u201d\n\u201cI feel that you wouldn\u2019t really understand it unless you\u2019ve been through\nit yourself. I\u2019m not going to ask anyone\nto go through that, I don\u2019t want anyone\nto go through things such as that. The\nmain thing I suppose is that it\u2019s not a\nweakness. Sure it\u2019s not a nice thing, a\ngood thing, but it\u2019s not a bad thing. You\nshouldn\u2019t beat yourself up over it; you\nshouldn\u2019t run away from it. It is what it\nis. There is help out there.\u201d\nWhat restrains me most from confiding\nin friends is their reaction if I expressed\nmy judgement of the situation. Things\nmost people have said to me are different to the feelings I have. These thoughts\nhave taken up so much of me, it seems\nlike they are part of who I am. If people\ndon\u2019t understand how I can think in this\nway it feels like they misunderstand\nme. Her depression has dramatically affected the way I just generally perceive\nthings in life overall; although not for the\nworse, or better. It\u2019s just different now.\nYOUR STORIES\nany concerns\nFriday 03 december 2010\nProfessor Denis Wright oversees\nWelfare Services at Imperial\nImperial College London\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 03 DECEMBER 2010 17\nBUSINESS\nWHAT\u2019S\nTHE FUTURE\nFOR BP?\nWhy is BP a good choice for graduates?\nEmma: We are interested in having a long term\nrelationship with Imperial graduates as many of\nthem have a desire to use their degree, and given\nImperial\u2019s focus on high quality engineering and\nscience it is an extremely good match for us as an\norganisation. The size and scale of the business\nis hugely exciting, and the chance to be part of\na business which has over 80,000 people in over\n100 countries is very energising. We have a high\ncalibre, 3-year graduate training program that\ngives students the foundation they need to then\ndevelop their technical or leadership careers.\nThen there is the quality of the people at BP, not\njust intellectually but in terms of their values and\ntheir enthusiasm for what they do. The quality of\nour people is what should ultimately influence a\nstudent\u2019s decision when choosing between companies that on the surface look very similar.\nDo you feel your graduate scheme offers you an\nadvantage over others, for example Shell?\nEmma: All oil companies have a role to play in\nattracting people to the oil and gas industry. We\nhave taken a pragmatic approach to how we hire\npeople, typically once per year. That has the advantage in that students create a cohort and set\nof relationships that they can use throughout their\ncareer. I think Shell\u2019s training is also very high\nquality, but it all comes down to the personality of\nthe organisation. The point about quality of people is our strongest differentiator.\nWhat would you say to someone who was put\noff applying to BP due to the events of the\nsummer?\nEmma: The incident in the Gulf of Mexico was\ntragic and one that we as an organisation have\nworked hard to overcome and ensure we restore\nthe region back to where it was. One of the key\ndrivers for people joining our organisation is to\nbe a part of that change, and to assist in developing BP going forward. Although there may be students who choose not to apply, we are still seeing\nthat high quality individual applicant. Students\nwho have taken the time to understand what really happened over the summer will see how they\ncould be part of that change.\nOil companies encounter environmental, technical and political disasters. What sort of processes does BP have in place to recover from\nthese and how do you plan for setbacks?\nPeter: Setbacks aren\u2019t inevitable. The oil and gas\nindustry is a hazardous one but has over the last\ncouple of decades become significantly safer. Our\ntrack record on safety has been one of continual\nimprovement, in terms of both personal and process safety. When there\u2019s an incident like the one\nin the Gulf of Mexico, one needs to step back and\nsee what has been learnt. It was a tragedy on both\na human and environmental scale, and there has\nbeen a lot of focus in terms of the response to the\nspill and the clean-up. We also need to consider\nwhat we can learn from it. A very central part of\nthis is engineering and technology. Clearly there\nare questions for BP and the industry about oil\nspill response technology and expertise.\nAlso, the leading oil companies, by the nature\nof what we do, operate on the frontiers \u2013 both political and technical. The places we go to find oil\nand gas are becoming increasingly difficult and\ndeepwater drilling is a part of this.\nBut deepwater drilling has been happening for\nyears.\nPeter: It has, although the trend has been to go\ndeeper and deeper. In the 1980\u2019s the North Sea\nwas considered to be deep at 300-600ft. In the\n1990\u2019s the West of Shetlands was one of the new\ndeepwater provinces and that was at about 1000ft.\nAnd now in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa\nthe operations are at 5000-10000ft.\nIs it true that at the onset of the Deepwater\nHorizon spill, the Blow Out Preventer (BOP)\nshould have been activated by the Remotely\nOperated Vehicle (ROV) but that the wrong\ninformation was sent to the ROV and the operating valve was turned in the wrong direction?\nPeter: There are a number of investigations ongo-ing, and BP has carried out its own investigation.\nIt appears that there was no single cause of this\naccident, but there was a complex and interlinked\nseries of failures: some mechanical, some human,\nsome engineering. The fact that the BOP didn\u2019t\nseal was one of the findings of that investiga-tion. But there are numerous investigations taking place and we can\u2019t really comment on those\noutcomes.\nWhere else does BP presently search for oil?\nPeter: The world\u2019s energy demand is rising. The\nInternational Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) latest prediction is for an increase of around 45% over the\nnext 20 years.\nThe demand for oil continues to rise and in order to replace depleted reserves and supply that\ngrowth, it is still projected that many new sources\nof oil and gas are required. So the international\nenergy industry is having to explore in ever more\ndifficult places including the frontiers of the deep\nseas and oceans. These include Russia, Alaska,\nGoM, Brazil, West Africa etc. You could also\nthink of frontiers in areas that are more geopoliti-cally challenging.\nDo you think it is riskier for BP to extract oil\nfrom the Gulf of Mexico where there\u2019s a big\nmedia spotlight than it is in places like the Indian Ocean?\nPeter: There are different risks in each area \u2013 geo-political, security, technological. BP\u2019s approach is\nthat wherever we work, we want to maintain the\nsame high standard.\nBP has branded itself as \u201cBeyond Petroleum\u201d.\nWhat does that mean?\nPeter: BP is an integrated oil company. There\u2019s\nexploration and production, refining, marketing,\nalternative energies, etc. The demand for oil and\ngas continues to rise but there are signs that the\nenergy mix is changing. We expect that there is a\ngrowing market for alternative energy and we aim\nto be a significant player. \u201cBeyond Petroleum\u201d\nwas a message that was around some time ago and\nwhat we would say now is we will be in the oil and\ngas business for a long time but we are making\nsteps to try and establish a move with technology\nin new alternative energy areas.\nYou don\u2019t think \u201cBeyond Petroleum\u201d is a bit of\nan overstatement when you are actually a petroleum company?\nPeter: We are a petroleum company but we do\nalso have a very active alternative energy business - as demand for more oil and gas and energy\nin general rises then companies need to adapt to\nmeet that demand.\nCharles Betts talks to\nEmma Hardaker-Jones and\nPeter Duff about graduate\nopportunities, the Deepwater\ndisaster and moving\n\u201cBeyond Petroleum\u201d\nLeft: Emma Hardaker-Jones, Head of Resourcing & Policy\nand Peter Duff, Senior Advisor, Projects and Capability\n\u201cThe places we go to find\noil and gas are becoming\nincreasingly difficult\u201d\nBusiness Editors: Sina Ataherian\nAfonso Campos\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHamish Muir\n\n"

The team went into the third\nquarter with a firm resolution to play to\nthe best of their ability.\nCenter Amelia worked tirelessly to ensure play stayed at the right end of the\ncourt. Newly created shooting duo, Angela and Heather demonstrated beautiful\nmovement and awareness around the\ngoal third, scoring goal after goal, keeping the team ahead. 1st XV rugby player\nand try scorer in last week\u2019s match,\nLouie Barnett, provided courtside analy-sis.

Following their hour long session, some of the players had a snowball fight whilst awaiting the arrival of their\nteam bus.

The Springboks will be looking to build on their victory\nover England last weekend by defeating a team largely comprised of players from the southern hemisphere which will\nbe no mean feat considering the South Africans had a dismal\nTri-Nations tournament as well as suffering a demoralising\nloss at the hands of Scotland earlier this Autumn.\nFootball\u2019s not\ncoming home\nSouth Africa\ntrain at Ethos\nThe dust hasn\u2019t even had time to settle; the Davids Cameron\nand Beckham as well as HRH Prince William are making\ntheir way back to England defeated. The 2018 World Cup will\nbe played in Russia and the next opportunity for England to\nhost the event will be in 20 years time. Initial reports suggest\nEngland, once favourites to stage the event, were eliminated\nduring the first round of voting. To many, the news signals\ndisappointment but perhaps not surprise.\nRussia were offered the most lucrative bid; they have the\nbacking of their government, the wealth of their numerous\noligarchs together with plans to construct new stadia and update run down transport routes. The concerns over the Russians\u2019 bid centred mainly around the transport of fans across\na country as vast as Russia.\nThe English bid has been sliding down a slippery slope\nsince May this year when Lord Triesman lost his job as chief\nof the Football Association after being taped accusing Russia\nand Spain of attempting to bribe referees. Triesman was in\ncharge of the 2018 World Cup bid and his resignation left the\nbidding team without its spearhead.\nBBC Panorama investigations identified corruption within\nFIFA, the governing body of world football, with the television program naming a number of FIFA members who have\naccepted bribes in exchange for votes when deciding on\nwhich country should host football events. FIFA insisted this\nwould not harm England\u2019s bid. Of course they did. Of course\nthey were lying. That is not to say that England would have\nwon had these allegations not been made, but they certainly\ndamaged the bid.\nSurely England, despite their bid self-imploding, could\nhave held off the threat of the joint Dutch-Belgian bid whose\nselling point was \u2018small size\u2019 and \u20182 million bicycles\u2019. It\nwould appear not. So, summer holiday 2018 in Russia any-one?

    "content": "FELIX 9\nNEWS\nor crippling debt?\neir student debt affects their lives\nWhat do you do now?\nI'm a researcher at a thinktank that focuses on international security. I specialize in nuclear weapons and disarma-ment. I studied Physics at Imperial for 3\nyears and I graduated in 2008 with a 2:1.\nI moved from a 4 year course to a 3 year\ncourse because I wanted to do a different\nmasters and I didn't want to waste my\nmoney on doing the masters at Imperial.\nDid you have a good idea of how much\ndebt you were accumulating at uni-versity?\nI was very aware of the cost of my degree\nwhen I was at Imperial. I was assisted\nby my parents and I was also sponsored\nand so I wasn't under any illusions about\nhow much debt I was accumulating. I\nwas very grateful for the support that I\nhad. If I had lived off my student loan\nonly I would have had a very restricted\nuniversity experience.\nHow big an impact does the debt re-paymnet have on your life?\nI haven't been able to afford to start\npaying back my student debt yet. Even\nthough I have a good job and I earn\nmore than the average salary, the repayments would mean I couldn't afford my\nrent. I don't have an expensive lifestyle,\nI don't drink or smoke and I don't spend\na huge amount on clothes. I've tried living at home to save on rent but because\nof high rail fares the savings were relatively small and I was spending 3 hours\ntraveling every day. The problem is that\nLondon is an expensive place to live and\nwork, and I haven't gone into a career\nwhich immediately pays a large salary.\nHow has your debt affected the decisions you're making?\nAnyone looking at the system rationally\nwould be motivated to take a high-pay-ing job rather than a low-paying job that\nis worthwhile to society. If I had less\ndebt I could take more risks and take a\nless certain, more difficult but more fulfilling career path.\nWhat do you think of the government\u2019s proposals?\nI think that a progressive graduate tax\nwould be the fairest solution. It recognizes that students benefit financially\nwhile also recognizing that some benefit\nmore than others. The main problem that\nI have with the changes is that I don't\nwant future generations of able students\nto be forced to go into the highest paid\nprofessions at the cost of wider society.\nWould you have been deterred by the\nincreased fees?\nI wouldn't have been deterred but I'm\nnot certain that I would have come to\nLondon with the new fees. I think that\npeople are understanding more and\nmore the significance of the debt that\nthey are taking on. Before the financial\ncrisis, in prosperous times, it would have\nbeen relatively straightforward to find a\nhighly-paying job and pay off your student loan. Now that people are less and\nless certain that they'll find employment\nafter graduating, I think that they'll start\nto reconsider entering into the amount of\ndebt that one incurs from a degree; even\nunder the current system never mind\nwith the new proposals.\nDo you think that you will pay off all\nof your debt?\nYes I will. I'd feel bad if I didn't pay it\nall off because I do think that students\nshould contribute to their education. I'm\nhoping to pay it off within 10-15 years.\nI'd love to pay it off next week.\nHave you found that your debt affects\nyour dealings with your bank?\nI haven't had any problems and my credit card company treats me no differently.\nIn fact they're worryingly generous\u2026\n\u201cEven though I\nearn more than the\naverage salary, the\nrepayments would\nmean I couldn\u2019t\nafford my rent\u201d\nSTUDENT\nDEBT\nGraduate Andrew Somerville\ntalks to Kadhim Shubber about\nthe burden of student debt\nthat because society as a whole benefits\nfrom those that hold degrees in a wide\nrange of fields, the general public should\nshoulder higher education\u2019s financial\nburden via tax increases. They believe\nthat a system of variable fees with some\nuniversities charging more per year than\nothers inappropriately creates a kind of\nmarket within higher education, and that\nit is wrong to burden students with such\nan amount of debt at such an early stage\nin their careers. This line of criticism is\nparticularly relevant to today\u2019s continuing debate surrounding the current coalition government\u2019s planned rise of the\ntuition fee cap to \u00a39,000, as the level of\ndebt that students graduate with is these\nproposals\u2019 most palpable change.\nSarah Church, 21, a recent graduate\nof the University of Lancaster, was\namongst the first intake of students\nwho were affected by the introduction\nof top-up fees in 2006. She criticizes\nthe current system as unfair, stating\nthat, \u201cAt the time, I wasn\u2019t really fazed\nby the top-up fees because I was too\nexcited about starting university. However, now that I\u2019ve finished, I am worried about paying my student loan back\nbecause I am in so much debt compared\nto my friends who graduated a year\nearlier!\u201d\nIn a speech to the House of Commons\non the 3rd of November 2010, Minister of State for Universities and Science David Willetts outlined the future\nof student finance after having listened\n\u201cwith open minds\u201d to Lord Browne\u2019s\nproposals.\nUnder the proposed changes, the\nminimum threshold of \u00a315,000 will be\nraised to \u00a321,000, with 9% of earnings\nabove this again being collected from\nthe graduate\u2019s salary. According to Willets, \u201craising the threshold reduces the\nmonthly repayments for every single\ngraduate,\u201d although by the previous\nanalysis, this will take considerably\nlonger than 20 years to repay. However,\nWilletts continues by making the claim\nthat around a quarter of graduates with\nthe lowest lifetime earnings will pay less\nthan under the system currently in place.\nSeeking to address concern from those\nwho will particularly be disadvantaged\nfaced with higher fees, Willetts brought\nup the intended plan of the \u2018National\nScholarships Programme\u2019, a \u00a3150 million scheme designed to ensure that\n\u201cbright potential students from poor\nbackgrounds\u201d will not be disadvantaged\nwhen applying to university. Benefits\ninclude a free first year or foundation\nyear in respective courses.\nCurrently, if annual earnings at any\npoint fall below the \u00a315,000 threshold\n(for example, upon being made redun-dant), repayments fall to zero. Unlike\na standard bank loan, failure to repay\ndue to circumstance is not penalised,\nand any outstanding debt remaining\nafter 25 years is written off (a significant contrast to the 30 years proposed\nby Willetts).\nCantalamessa is opposed to the government\u2019s planned changes, citing the\nloss of various \u201cgenerous grants\u201d and\nnoting a marked change in the situation\ntoday, \u201cStudents now not only have larger debts, as they have to pay triple what\nI did for course fees, not to mention that\ncould triple again, but also are given less\nof a maintenance loan to live on.\u201d\nWilletts suggests that the changes to\nfunding \u201cwill deliver a better deal for our\nstudents, for our graduates and our universities.\u201d Graduates of the future will\nhave no choice but to determine whether\nthis is a deal worth the consequences.\nAccording to David\nWilletts, \u201craising\nthe threshold\nreduces the monthly\nrepayments for every\nsingle graduate\u201d\nGraduate views\nDaisy Cantalamessa 23\nUniversity of Manchester\nDaisy does not worry about paying back\nher student loan, as it is a gradual process and will not impose too much of\na burden on her income. However she\nis concerned about the possible consequences of carrying the debt. Especially\nwith regard to applying for a mortgage\nor bank loan.\n\u201cI feel the current repayment system\nis a fair one, although I think we should\nbe given more control over how much\nwe pay back. I would definitely feel\ndifferently if my student debt appeared\non my credit records. If I knew that in\nthe future my student loan could affect\nmy ability to get a mortgage or a loan,\nI might think twice about how relevant\nmy course was going to be for future\nemployment or maybe even if going to\nuniversity would be the right thing to\ndo.\u201d\nTom MacDonald 26\nUniversity of Northumbria\nTom did not worry about paying back his\nstudent loan until he was promoted to a\nmanagerial position and has since noticed\na considerable deficit in his monthly sal-ary. \u201cBefore being promoted, I hardly noticed the difference in my salary because\nit was something as little as nine pounds\na month. Now that I am a manager and\nmy salary has increased considerably, I\nlose approximately [...] seventy pounds a\nmonth repaying my loan.\u201d\nWhen asked about the potential increase in tuition fees, Tom is in agreement with the government. \u201cI believe it,\n[the cuts and fees], to be the only way\nto get this country back on its feet. The\ngovernment had to make cuts to make\nup for over-spending when Labour were\nin power and if this is one of the only\nways we can get back to some kind of\nnormality, then so be it.\u201d\nSarah Church 21\nUniversity of Lancaster\nSarah was amongst the first students\nwho were affected by the introduction\nof top-up fees in 2006. \u201cI have not started to pay my loan back yet because I\ndon\u2019t earn enough money, but I dread\nwhen that time comes and I worry about\nhow long it will take to pay everything\nback.\u201d\nSarah insisted that the current system isn\u2019t fair and that there should be\na change in structure of how student\nloans are repaid. \u201cFirst of all, I believe\ngraduates should have to earn more before starting to pay back the loan, such\nas \u00a320-25,000 a year. I won\u2019t be earning\nenough earning \u00a315,000 to live, never\nmind starting to pay back debt! Secondly, I believe graduates who earn a lot of\nmoney, such as \u00a340,000 a year, should\nbe made to pay big chunks of their loan\nback on a monthly basis.\u201d\nFriday 03 december 2010\n\n"

With\noccupations of university buildings happening all across the country, the reactionary protests have morphed into a\nnew grassroots movement of students,\nacademics, school kids and trade union-ists. The defining images of the protests\nare still pictures of violence and chaos\nfrom Millbank Tower on the 10th of\nNovember; but a visit to the UCL occupation is proof of how unrepresentative\nthat incident was.\nUpon entering the occupation in the\nJeremy Bentham room at UCL, there\nare three details which I immediately\nnotice. First is the sheer number of people who are in the room. Second is the\nvariety of the protestors; looking around\nI can see students from different ethnic\nbackgrounds, post graduates and staff.\nThe last and most striking detail is what\nthe protestors are doing.\nPicture the scene. A protestor stands\nup in a room giving a preamble to the\nissue at hand to an audience of about\none hundred. Quiet murmuring can be\nheard all around. A polite hand is raised\nand the microphone is handed over. The\nnew speaker stands up and starts talking passionately into the microphone;\naudience members wave their hands in\nthe air to show approval. Suddenly, as\nthe speaker approaches a controversial\npoint, hands shoot up, and the microphone is passed on quickly. This is democracy at its purest; where everyone\nis involved in the decision making process and no opinions are ignored. Similar events are happening all across the\ncountry \u2013 these are the \u2018New Student\nProtesters\u2019.\nThese thoughtful, articulate activists\nare a far cry from the thuggish brutes depicted in the media. There is no sense of\nunyielding obstinacy and discussion is\nencouraged. Indeed, disagreements happen frequently, and heated discussions\nfollow, but the atmosphere is anything\nbut hostile.\nThat is not to say that the underlying\npurpose of the occupation has changed.\nThe protestors still feel extremely\nstrongly the issue of the tuition fee cap\nand the cuts to education funding. But\nas internal support for the occupation\nhas increased, the demands of the occupation have changed to reflect that.\nA student explained that since the occupation enjoys support from some of\nthe academics and the support staff, the\ndemands have changed to tackle other\nissues as well; such as the wage of the\nsupport staff and the job cuts of academ-ics.\nThe organization of the occupation\nis very impressive. Protestors are split\ninto groups which tackle certain issues,\nreporting back to the main body of protestors at each general meeting. And\nyet there is no leading figure organizing\nthe whole of the occupation. Every decision is made via a consensus or voting system, truly reflecting the views of\nthe majority. From speaking to several\nstudents, it is clear that this system is\nworking well. They explain to me that\nthey feel as though all of their actions\ncontribute directly to the movement, and\nconsequently any successes are much\nmore satisfying.\nIntegral to this feeling of solidarity\nis the overwhelming show of support\nfrom other universities. Support messages from universities across the UK,\nsuch as Oxford, Newcastle and Leeds,\nand even from universities abroad, such\nas Sydney and Pisa, are plastered all\nacross the walls. The occupation also\nhosts workshops on peaceful forms of\nprotests which students from across\nthe UK regularly attend. The message\nis clear; \u2018We are not isolated. We are\npart of something much, much bigger-something that could make a difference\u2019.\nThe scale of the occupation has also\nattracted visitors from across the coun-try. During my visit, I met students from\nManchester, Nottingham and Brighton\nwho had all come to show their support\nof the movement. It is not just students\neither; media, representatives of the\ntrade unions, feminist groups, public\nfigures (including Polly Toynbee, Billy\nBragg and Emmy the Great) and socialist organizations all frequently visit the\noccupation. Speaking to a representative of a socialist organization, who\nwould not clarify which organization\nhe was representing, believes that they\ncan use the momentum gained by the\nstudent protests to point out other perceived injustices in the coalition government\u2019s policy; such as public sector\njob cuts.\nIt is clear that lessons have been\nlearnt from the NUS marches. The protestors were careful of what was being\nsaid in my presence, and some of the\nSo what\nhappens at an\noccupation?\nAs lecture theatres around the country\nplay host to student activists, Ian Wei\nreports from the UCL occupation\n\u201cThese thoughtful, articulate\nactivists are a far cry from the\nthuggish brutes often depicted\nin the media\u201d\nThe champagne socialists at the meeting ar\nIan Wei\nFriday 03 december 2010\nStudents grill President Alex Kendall about what\nthey see as a lack of representation in the Union\nThe first signs of opposition to the government\u2019s\nhigher education proposals are emerging at Imperial.\n\u2018Imperial for Education\u2019, a group opposed to higher\neducation cuts, held its first meeting in the SAF lobby\non Thursday.\n18 students attended the organizing meeting which\nwas also attended by Union President Alex Kendall\nwho said that \u201calthough I disagree with their views,\nI\u2019m glad that students are getting involved in the debate and voicing their opinions in a democratic way\u201d.\nThe students were extremely critical of the President and the Union\u2019s stance on the higher education\nissue, saying that they thought the Union\u2019s higher\neducation policy was passed prematurely without a\nproper understanding of student opinion. They also\nquestioned whether the Union was being representative on the issue of higher education with one student asking, \u201cWhy do we have a Union at all?\u201d\nDirect action such as an occupation was also discussed with opinion divided between those who felt\nthat such action would alienate other students and\nthose who believed that there was a need to \u201cbreak\ndown the picture that everything is all right.\u201d One\nstudent commented that occupations were probably\nmore interesting to people outside of the university\nthan those actually at Imperial.\nThere was a rejection of what the students saw\nas the privatization of universities. \u201cI don\u2019t agree\nwith the choice between \u00a33,000 or \u00a39,000 tuition\nfees. Education is a public good. It should be free\nand funded through higher taxation on the wealthy\u201d\nsaid one student. However, in what was an open discussion with differing opinions, another student said\nthat the focus should be on \u201cpreserving the standard\nof education.\u201d\nImperial for Education organizer James Goldsack\nsaid that the meeting was \u201cproductive\u201d and that it allowed \u201cstudents to express their views and opinions\non the rise in fees and the funding cuts\u201d.

    "content": "ARTS\nFELIX\nFriday 03 december 2010\n26\nArts Editor: Rox Middleton\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIf you read nothing else\nthis week...\nMatt Colvin wants you to pick up a\ncult hit from 1998. Step this way for\na brilliant satire on unrequited love,\nhorrific murder and high school\nWhat\u2019s your favourite book and why should we read\nit? Tell us in 350-400 words and send it to\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nProbably best known under pseudonym Lemony\nSnicket, author of the popular \u2018A Series of Unfortunate Events\u2019 books, Handler\u2019s debut novel delves\ninto the lives of a group of close-knit friends at a San\nFrancisco high school with razor sharp precision.\nIn a year where they should be worrying about university applications, we instead, through the diary\nof the smitten Flannery Culp, enter a world where\npretentiousness runs high and academic rigour less\nso. Amidst the trials and tribulations, the dinner parties and social politics, the group end up encounter-by\nDaniel Handler\nThe Basic\nEight\ning far more adult problems than their precocious\nminds can cope with, culminating in murder by unquestionably fashionable croquet mallet.\nVery loosely based on Handler\u2019s own experiences at high school, the author delivers a perfectly\npitched account of late teenage life, which, despite\nthe exaggerations, strikes particularly true to real-ity, especially with regards to the relationships between the friends. Flitting from high tension to good\nnatured banter with ease, it is this interaction of the\ncharacters, and lack thereof, which drives the heart\nof the story.\nWriting from the perspective of Flannery, a fantastically unhinged yet perfectly composed character,\nHandler is able to use the blackest of black humour\nboth through both the mentally fraught individual\nand the plot itself to deliver a thoroughly uproarious\nyet hugely uncomfortable tale.\nHandler proves to be a playful master of words\nand comedy, with lines so deadpan that they probably deserve their own funeral. A triumph of unreliable narration, the reader\u2019s perceptions of the main\ncharacters changes with alarming regularity, yet this\nnever quite stretches credulity to breaking point. All\nthe better, by the end one is left with countless\ninterpretations as to the motivations of Flannery \u2013\nthis is a book firmly placed outside any kind of black\nand white definite conclusions. A scathing satire on\nvarious issues such as education, media scaremon-gering and the arrogance of adolescence, polished\noff with a healthy dose of Grade A wit, The Basic\nEight rewards multiple reads and proves that Handler isn\u2019t just for the kids.\nTate Modern's exhibition on Gauguin is his first\ninternational exhibition for more than 50 years.\nIt documents his shifting styles, focusing on his\ninterest in depicting myth and the supernatu-ral, and culminating in his most famous works\npainted in Tahiti. As well as allowing the viewer to observe Gauguin's very variable painting\nstyles and progression as an artist, it also documents and provides context to the painter\u2019s life,\nproviding two rooms full of articles, letters and\nhistorical memorabilia.\nThe exhibition begins with a series of self\nportraits. Each portrait shows how Gauguin\nwanted to project himself at different point in\nhis career, from amateur artist and stockbroker to fulltime artist. There is one particular\nself portrait completed when Gauguin returned\nfrom his travels in Tahiti for the first time, depicting himself in front of one of his own Tahitian paintings, showing his determination to\npicture himself as the exotic travelling artist\nand starting to give an indication of the artist\u2019s\ngeneral attitude.\nYou get a further clue beyond the first room,\nwhere quotes from Gauguin displayed on the\nwall proclaim such statements as \u2018I am a great\nartist and I know it\u2019. A painting is also on\nshow, \u2018Christ in the garden of olives\u2019 in which\nGauguin likens his suffering to Christ on the\neve of his crucifixion by portraying Christ\nthrough self-portrait. The whole exhibition\ngives the general impression Gauguin may\nnot have been such a modest guy. As much\nas Gauguin is self-congratulatory, he is very\nscathing of other artists, describing the pointillist Seurat as the \u201clittle dot\u201d in his letters.\nThe highlight of the exhibition is the works\nGauguin painted in Tahiti. Female figures in\nearthy shades of yellows and greens, amongst\nscenery of vibrant oranges, purples and greens\nhave a very exotic quality and show Gauguin\u2019s\nvery original and bold use of colour. These are\nvery distinctive, but he seems to have only really developed such a unique style on his move\nto Tahiti. His earlier work is often reminiscent\nof impressionists such as Van Gogh, who he\nspent time with in Arles in 1888, and whilst not\nunpleasant, is a bit unremarkable.\nThere are, however, some more interesting early paintings. I particularly liked one of\nhis children sleeping, Clovis Asleep, in which\nGauguin had incorporated dreamlike imagery\ninto the wallpaper. He includes other elements\nof myth in many of his paintings, from the\nChristianity of Brittany to the pagan myths of\nTahiti. Despite the fact that the island converted to Christianity almost 100 years before and\nmany of the women dressed conservatively,\nthis did not deter Gauguin from painting exactly how he wanted to portray his \u2018savage\u2019 ideal,\nand describing to others the innocent purity of\nthe beliefs and dress of the natives.\nAfter he left his wife, Gauguin lived permanently in Tahiti taking various women as his\nmistresses. The hedonistic life Gauguin now\nfollowed is illustrated well in the exhibition by\nthe door to his home, carved with lintels and\nthe words \u2018House of Pleasure\u2019. His argumenta-tiveness did not wane and he got in trouble with\nthe authorities over his refusal to pay tax. His\nlater years, however, were plagued by syphilis\nand he died of heart failure in 1903.\nAlthough I found Gauguin\u2019s earlier paintings a little bit disappointing, the later paintings in Tahiti may make the exhibition worth\na visit. And whilst Gauguin is a very interesting man, revolutionary in his time, I have to\nsay that the exhibition portrays him as a little\nobnoxious.\nThe Glass Menagerie enfolds us in the memories of Tom, a young poet trapped by his dependent family, who both appears in each scene\nand narrates the play from his present. This is\nthe play that made Tennessee Williams famous\nand aside from an occasionally dodgy Southern accent (Deborah Findlay as the mother)\nand a limp that may have hopped from foot to\nfoot (the sister) the Young Vic\u2019s production is\nflawless. An aura of memory is cleverly crafted by the presence of the two musicians as part\nof the multi-level set \u2013 particularly poignant\nmoments in the play are haunted by the eerie\nsound from the percussionist\u2019s array of wine\nglasses (the licking your finger and running it\nround the rim trick).\nDespite any observations about her limp I\nthought Sin\u00e9ad Matthews as Tom\u2019s frail sister\nLaura gave the best performance in the play. I\nwas so convinced I would find it hard to ever\nimagine her walking straight. It is believed this\ncharacter was based on William\u2019s own sister and\nhis portrayal is tender and sometimes painful.\nThe premise of the play is the mother\u2019s obsessive plans to find a \u201cgentleman caller\u201d for\nLaura so that she can be taken off her brother\u2019s\nhands, as their father, represented here only\nby a giant portrait, quit the family many years\nago. But Laura\u2019s physical fragility is matched\nby a crippling shyness, totally opposed to the\nhuge character of her mother, leading her to\nhide in a world of glass animals.\nMatthews makes Laura very likable and\nwe cringe with her in a perfectly pitched final\nscene when a gentleman caller does indeed ar-rive. His normality and easy charm provides a\nsharp contrast with her extreme awkwardness\nand the strange parallel reality this isolated\nfamily lives in. When the family\u2019s electricity is\ncut off, the stage is lit with real candles, drawing us into their home and lives. I found the\nmoment when Laura and her caller dance especially sweet and memorable. We see her begin\nto blossom in his presence and the inevitable\ndisappointment when it transpires he has nothing to offer her is crushing and hard to watch.\nThe mother, a faded Southern Belle indomitable and hilariously flirtatious when her gentleman finally calls, is hugely enjoyable to watch.\nHer character provides laughs but Findlay also\ngets across her insensitive, domineering side\nfrom which Tom is so desperate to escape.\nGo Go Go Gauguin\nEnchanting glass memories\nCecily Goodwin\nGlass Menagerie at the Young Vic until\n15th Jan.

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX 19\nFriday 03 december 2010\nYou\u2019ve said previously that there is\na possibility of resolving the ArabIsraeli conflict and it\u2019s not an eternal\nconflict that can\u2019t be resolved. What\nkeeps you so optimistic?\nFirst of all you have to see if there are\nbasic principles which people can agree\non to resolve the conflict. On the basic\nprinciples, you have widespread agree-ment, whether you look at the voting\nrecord of the U.N. General Assembly,\nwhether you look at what the Arab\nLeague has said, what the Organisation\nof the Islamic Conference has said, or\nwhether you look at the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice.\nYou could look at a wide range of respected and representative bodies and\nthey all seem to agree on how to resolve\nthe conflict, and judging from that record the main obstacle is Israel and the\nUnited States. And, at least in the United\nStates, you can see significant shifts in\npublic opinion. We\u2019re still in the early\nstage but there seems to be the prospect\nthat we can reach public opinion if we\u2019re\nreasonable and if we\u2019re principled. We\ncan reach public opinion and maybe\nforce a settlement on the Israelis who\nare blocking it.\nThe Jerusalem Post published an article about the Justice Week here at\nImperial College, attacking it as anti-Western and criticising some of the\nchoice of speakers and event themes.\nDo you feel that they have a point or\nare they unjustified in their attacks?\nWell, first of all the Jerusalem Post is\nnot a newspaper. It\u2019s just a propaganda\nrack. Nobody takes it seriously. It\u2019s\nvery rarely cited, nowadays. There was\na time when it was under fairly liberal\npublishers up until the early nineties.\nThen it was a reputable paper. But now,\nyou read it for laughs; it\u2019s like the comic\nsection of the newspaper. Although, oc-casionally, you know there\u2019s an expression in English \u201cEven a broken clock is\nright twice a day,\u201d and once or twice a\nmonth there\u2019s actually something in the\nJerusalem Post of some interest.\nYou frequently attack and deconstruct\nZionist propaganda, yet you seem uncritical of Palestinian propaganda by\norganisations such as Hamas. Do you\nfeel that this also needs to be decon-structed?\nWell, first of all, I\u2019m old fashioned. You\ndon\u2019t deconstruct, you critically analyse.\nI think that people are using this ridiculous French terminology and in French,\neverything is empty.\nSo I critically analyse the Israeli propaganda as though there is only one\nfundamental issue, which is settling\nthe conflict. I don\u2019t know much about\ninternal Israeli society. I follow public\nopinion polls on support or not support\nfor the settlement but, in general, my\nrange is pretty limited. I\u2019m interested\nin the foreign policy issues and, other-wise, I don\u2019t particularly care. The same\nthing with the Palestinians; I don\u2019t really\nknow much about internal Palestinian\nsociety. I\u2019m just looking at who\u2019s blocking the settlement.\nIn 2008 Israel banned you from entering the country for 10 years. Here in\nthe U.K., the government has also recently banned individuals like Geert\nWilders and Zakir Naik. Are such\nactions ever justified, or is there an\ninfringement on freedom of speech\nwhen governments do these things?\nNo, they\u2019re never justified. I\u2019m not a flag\nwaver but probably it\u2019s one of the virtues\nof the United States that there\u2019s a much\nbroader conception of liberty of speech.\nThe media are much narrower but at\nleast conceptually we\u2019re pretty conventional on issues of Freedom of Speech\nand on the whole it\u2019s much better. There\nhave been cases of political people\nwe\u2019ve banned from entering the country.\nBut, in terms of range of viewpoints, it\u2019s\npretty broad in the U.S.; at least what\u2019s\npermissible. That doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s\na range of viewpoints on the television\nor radio \u2013 no there is not. But what\u2019s\npermissible, and I think that\u2019s sensible.\nI mean the basic principles of John Stuart Mill\u2019s \u2018On Liberty\u2019 I think is right.\nThe arguments he makes in free, unfettered speech, I think are correct. I don\u2019t\nreally accept there are any grounds for\nbanning anyone. But that doesn\u2019t mean\nyou can\u2019t have an opinion. You can say\nthat Geert Wilders is what he is; a really\nnasty piece of work. But a nasty piece\nof work should have the right to speak.\nWhat would you say to people who\nwould describe you as delivering hateful messages?\nWell, what I would say is that people\nhave the right to deliver hateful mes-sages. There\u2019s not any prescription in\nfree speech only delivering love filled\nmessages. I happen to think they\u2019re not\nhateful, I happen to think they\u2019re factu-al. I happen to think they\u2019re actually not\neven particularly radical. They\u2019re pretty\nmainstream in my opinion. But even if\nthat were not the case and even if you interpret them as being hateful, well there\nare two possibilities. Either they\u2019re hateful of the abstract, in which case they\nstill have the right to say it, but then they\nmay be hateful in the specific sense that\nyou\u2019re doing hateful things. So, you\u2019re\nevoking a hateful reaction. I hate injustice \u2013 so I have a hateful message for\nthose committing injustice. I hate injus-tice, I hate suffering. So it\u2019s hateful, but\nI think that\u2019s permissible-hateful. But,\neven if it were just hateful-hateful, it\u2019s\nstill allowed. I\u2019m sorry, but you have no\nright to dictate to me what I have to say.\nThousands of students across the U.K.\nparticipate in activities like Palestine\ndays, Gaza awareness weeks, fundraising or Boycott Israeli goods. They\nbelieve they are making a positive dif-ference. What would be your message\nto them?\nFirst of all, I have faith in the reasoning\ncapacities and judgement of young peo-ple. I don\u2019t really like to try to lecture\nthem on what they should do. I\u2019ll give\nmy opinion but also I want to respect\nother people\u2019s political and intellectual\nautonomy.\nOn the question of tactics, I support\nthe boycotts which are anchored in international law. So, if the settlements\nare illegal, settlement products are ille-gal, marketing those products is illegal\nand the protesting the marketing of illegal products from illegal settlements,\nI think is perfectly legitimate. Under\ninternational law, it\u2019s illegal to transfer\nweapons to a country which is a consistent violator of human rights. Israel is,\naccording to Amnesty International, a\nconsistent violator of human rights and\nAmnesty International says there has to\nbe a comprehensive total arms boycott\non Hamas and Israel. So, the protesting\nof arms transfers from the U.K. to Israel,\nI supported. That\u2019s the law.\nBut when you start going towards political boycotts which include anything\nand everything Israeli, I consider that\nproblematic because if you were saying\n\u2018I\u2019m boycotting anything Israeli until the\nend of occupation\u2019, I could see that. The\nproblem is people don\u2019t say \u2018until they\nend the occupation.\u2019 They say \u2018we\u2019re\nboycotting anything Israeli\u2019 and then\nyou\u2019re not really clear. Do they want\nto dismantle the occupation or do they\nwant to dismantle Israel? I don\u2019t support dismantling Israel. Yes, Israel does\nhorrible things, but so does the U.K. and\nwhatever Israel does that\u2019s horrible, it\u2019s\na tiny fraction of what the U.S. does\nthat\u2019s horrible every minute, of every\nhour, of every day. So, since I don\u2019t see\nany boycotts calling for the dismantling\nof the United States, or the dismantling\nof the U.K. , then I\u2019m not supporting the\ndismantling of Israel. There\u2019s a deliberate ambiguity about whether you want\nto end the occupation or whether you\nwant to end Israel.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you have no\nright to dictate to me what I\nhave to say.\u201d\nLast Friday, the JewishAmerican political\nscientist Norman\nFinkelstein gave a\nlecture at Imperial about\nthe 2009 Gaza conflict\nas part of Islamic\nSociety\u2019s Justice Week.\nA controversial figure, he\nis infamous for arguing\nthat Israel is exploiting a\n\u201cHolocaust Industry\u201d for\nits own ends\n\u201cWhatever Israel\ndoes that\u2019s horrible,\nit\u2019s a tiny fraction of\nwhat the U.S. does\n[...] every minute\u201d\non Hamas, boycotts and\nliberty\nInterview by\nHassan\nJoudi\nNORMAN\nFINKELSTEIN\nKadhim Shubber\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 5\nNEWS\nT\nhe government\u2019s planned changes\nto university funding are anything\nbut inconsequential. Protests and\nsit-ins have sprung up at universities around the country, but the\nanger does not seem to have reached Imperial in any significant way. Walking around\ncampus, the only signs of opposition to these\nchanges are a few discreet posters. Indeed, the\nImperial Student Union\u2019s Council recently\nvoted to broadly support the Browne review,\nwhich proposes lifting the tuition fee cap for\nhome students.\nOn the face of it, there does seem to be a\nwidespread apathy concerning the government\u2019s policy among many students. There are\nmany possible reasons for this. Imperial has an\nexceptionally large proportion of international\nstudents: 34.5%, compared to 23.9% for UCL,\nwhose student body is one of the most vocal\nabout government policy. Most importantly,\nImperial does not offer arts subjects, which will\nsuffer the brunt of the government\u2019s cuts; many\nwill see an 80% cut in their funding while some\nwill receive no funding at all. In addition, funding for science subjects is being protested. Simply put, Imperial students will not be affected\nas severely as those at other universities. They\nhave little motivation for action, with many of\nthe students interviewed reluctant to disrupt\ntheir tight schedule of lectures and labs to go\nand protest. Other students, while accepting\nthat the funding changes will cause difficulties,\ngrudgingly agree with them. Michael Lewis,\na second year Chemical Engineering student,\nsummarised this saying that though he believed\nin \u201cno fees, with the country in its current state,\nthe increases are necessary\u201d.\nThere are, however, some signs of resistance.\nThis Tuesday Imperial for Education organised\na discussion on opposing the budget cuts and\ntuition fee increases, and led a small contingent\nof Imperial students to the protests in central\nLondon. Reuben Gibbons, who is heavily involved in this group, believes that the proposed\n80% cut in government funding to higher\neducation, will be detrimental to universities,\nwhich will be unable to recoup the losses by\ncharging higher fees as these will discourage\nmany applicants. He rejects Union President\nAlex Kendall\u2019s views that the debt will not\nadversely affect students because the amount\nthat they will have to pay back will be tied\nto their earnings. Gibbons points out that the\ndebt will still be a real burden, especially with\ngraduates paying it back for 30 years, without\nan option for earlier repayment, and with the\ninterest rate being higher than what it is now.\nCaroline Clark, another member of Imperial\nfor Education, believes that \u201cit is inevitable\nthat students from poorer backgrounds will be\nput off\u201d and that the highest charging universities under the new system, which are almost\ncertain to include Imperial, will only be \u201caccessible to the privileged elite\u201d. She believes that\n\u201cthe government should increase taxes on the\nrich and clamp down on tax avoidance\u201d instead\nof raising fees. Union President Alex Kendall\nrejected their arguments saying that \u201cthe only\nway to ensure that students can still come to\nImperial, and that Imperial has enough fund-ing, is by raising fees but also ensuring that\nbursaries and the necessary support is there to\nensure access for all.\u201d\nGibbons believes that \u201cpeople care the same\nhere as elsewhere\u201d about these issues but that\nthey lack the support of the Union. This was\ncorroborated by a number of students, with a\ngroup of first year undergraduates saying that\nthey had no time to organise action against the\ncuts without the Union\u2019s help. They were angry\nabout its policy and thought that they had little\nchance to influence it. This highlighted the\nvery poor communication between the Union\nand the students that it is meant to represent.\nNone of the first years knew the dates of the\nUnion Council meetings or how to contact\nCouncil members, despite one of them being a\nyear rep himself. Deputy President (Education)\nAlex Dahinten rejected the criticisms saying\n\u201cwe promoted the Council debate extensively.\nStudents had ample opportunity to voice their\nconcerns if they strongly disagreed with the\npolicy that we put forward.\u201d He did however\nsay that the Union plan to revisit and adjust the\npolicy in January.\nImperial for Education is critical of how\nthe Union\u2019s means of determining students\u2019\nviews about funding issues. According to Gibbons the student survey was limited, asking no\nquestions about maintenance loans, and only\nincluding about 5% of students. Despite this,\nhe believes that Council was premature to draw\nup its policy on funding before consulting its\nresults, which seem to suggest that students\nprefer the current system. Only 5.3% of those\nsurveyed, agreed to students leaving university\nowing more than \u00a330,000, which are certain\nto exceed if Imperial raises its tuition fees to\nthe predicted \u00a39,000. Alex Dahinten conceded\nthat he \u201chad the wrong expectations about how\nmany students would participate in the survey\u201d\nand while not wishing to dismiss the results,\nsaid that they were unrepresentative of the student body as 54% of respondents were in their\n1st year.\nAlmost all of the Council members who voted on the Union\u2019s policy have refused to answer\nquestions on their decision. Only 4 out of the\n35 elected student representatives were willing\nto speak to Felix. Union Advocate Naida Dzigal rejected the policy saying that she supported free higher education. CGCU Academic\nAffairs Officer Marcus Ulmefors has decided\nto oppose a large increase in fees as he fears\nthat they might discourage EU home students,\na view supported by a number of current stu-dents. SCC Chair Rhodri Oliver, however, said\nthat he still supported the motion while RCSU\nPresident Scott Heath argued for the need for\na new opinion poll that covers more areas and\nhas better designed questions. He is quite open\nto the Council changing its policy based on the\nresults of this new survey and face-to-face consultation with students . Union President Alex\nKendall conceded that there was a need to\nproperly gauge student opinion as \u201cthe debate\nhas really grown recently\u201d. CGCU Academic\nAffairs Officer Marcus Ulmefors has decided\nto oppose a large increase in fees as he fears\nthat they might discourage EU home students,\na view supported by a number of current stu-dents. Even those council members who continue to support fee increases point out that\nthe Council\u2019s priority is to help students, with\nRecreational Clubs Committee Chair Nathaniel\nBottrell stressing the Union\u2019s commitment \u201cto\ncampaigning for scholarships and bursaries to\nenable the brightest students to come to Imperial regardless of their background\u201d. Despite\nthis there is no indication that the Union is going to support or organise the type of action\nseen at Universities such as Oxford and UCL.\nAlex Kendall told Felix that \u201cstudents are welcome to protest but I think that [the Union\u2019s]\ntime is better spent working for our students. It\nmay be dull but it does more to improve their\nuniversity experience\u201d.\nWhen will Imperial march?\nWhile students around the country have been taking direct action, Imperial has remained quiet. Maciej Matuszewski finds out why\nStudents are reluctant\nto disrupt their tight lab\nand lecture schedules\nAre you angry\nabout the\nproposed\nchanges? Let\nus know at\nfelix@imperial.\nac.uk\nMitesh Patel\nAre Imperial students too busy juggling coursework to join the protests?\nFriday 03 december 2010\n\n"

Dr Noble, who led the research,\nsaid: \u201cThey might have gone a considerable way...\nThen they start trying to turn east and north and the\nfirst place you can go east, of course, is the Straits\nof Gibraltar.\u201d The sharks found here are most similar to those near New Zealand, about 12,000 miles\naway!\nIn this whirlwind of mathematics, du Sautoy provides us with an irresistible combination of anec-dotes, mathematical mysteries and history. Articulately conveying his own love for the subject whilst\nalso providing us with a plethora of mathematics, he\nweaves an intricate and emotive tale of the fundamental questions in mathematics.\nMarcus du Sautoy is a brilliant populiser of mathematics and author of several other books, one of his\ngreatest strengthes being that he never patronises\nthe reader, maintaining a belief that the wider public\ncan and should understand maths.\nIt is this complete faith in the reader that makes\nthe book so compelling, as is du Sautoy\u2019s humble\nwriting; he is personable and describes his passion\nfor and reliance on the subject. It is clear, however\nthat perhap maths needs Sautoy as much as he\nneeds it. Read this book \u2013 I challenge you not to\nlearn something. Katya-Yani Vyas\nWant to save the planet\nand eat meat? Eat Man\nSamuel Furse\nOne thing that is often said by vegetarians is\nthat meat farming is not sustainable. Figures\nare not (scientifically) clear, though what is\nobvious is that farm production of animals for\nhuman consumption requires a lot more in the\nway of nitrogenous input than for arable farming \u2013 not least because the animals we farm\nare chiefly herbivores and feeds given to them\nmust themselves be grown. In practice this is\nachieved from grain not suitable for human\nconsumption (e.g. because the harvest period\nwas too damp). I do not know what we would\ndo with such grain if we did not give it to animals \u2013 we would have to find some use for it\nin order to avoid just wasting it; its entry into\nthe market is weather-driven and so pretty un-avoidable.\nSo, we have meat production requiring more\nresources per kilogram produced than for arable production. Good news for those who did\nbiology A-level is that all the stuff on the energy levels in food webs they learnt has been\nvindicated as not being wrong. On this basis\nit seems not too much of a leap to go to meat\nbeing unsustainable: we have over six billion\nmouths to feed and only a limited amount of\nfertile land that is divided up in so unegalitar-ian a manner as to make the French strike for a\ncentury. It is easy to reach the conclusion that\nthere are too many people for satisfactory meat\nproduction.\nIn fact, taking away technology of any serious kind, and returning humans to the food\nweb structure from whence we came, it has\nbeen calculated that there would be a population of around 10k across the globe. This is approximately the same number as go in and out\nof Piccadilly Circus station every day. As the\ncurrent world population is approaching four\nFriday 03 DEcEMBER 2010\nYou won\u2019t believe it...\norders of magnitude larger than this, it rather\nbegs the question of how this has happened.\nClearly clean water, medicine, education, shelter and so on are important factors in this but\nso, I believe, is food. I understand there is evidence for the start of arable farming in either\nthe cradle of humanity, or further east in what\nwe now call the Middle East. This was the time\nwhen humans stopped being nomadic hunter-gatherers and started living in one place. The\nwheat was bred to give the right kind of husk\nand so on, and thus fed the population at the\ntime. Presumably this, although a break from\nwhat had gone before, was sustainable as the\npopulation grew and since then humans dependent upon farming for food have dominated.\nA few thousand years of refining and develop-ment, including the use of draught animals to\ndo the work we could not or did not want to do,\ntook us to the middle ages. Soon after then, we\nhad ploughing. There was uproar in the 16th\ncentury about ploughs. People did not trust\nmachines \u2013 why should they when they were\ndoing their work? There were similar fears\nabout the use of animals to pull ploughs \u2013 what\nif all the animals die?\nThere were few more developments until\nthe end of the 19th century at which point the\nrevolution of mechanisation started to take\nhold. Eating meat is perfectly sustainable of\ncourse, provided we have the fertilisers (thanks\nto the Haber process) and methods with which\nto farm it. The problem is that food production follows market forces, including demand.\nOver thousands of years we have used cognitive intelligence to increase food availability.\nThis has lifted a limit on the proliferation of\nour species. Thus, it is not crops or ploughing\nor even peculiarly-shaped bovines that are un-sustainable, but you and I.\nPerhaps we should eat each other.\nHello and welcome to Felix\u2019s new, unimagi-natively-titled, Science Fiction Column. I\u2019ve\nalways been passionate about this topic and I\nhope that I\u2019ll be able to pass some of this excitement on to you.\nEach week I\u2019ll try to entertain you with my\nthoughts on films, television shows and books\nin the genre which, for good or bad reasons, I\nfound memorable. I\u2019d thought, however, that\nI\u2019d start with something more general and devote today\u2019s column to science fiction\u2019s relationship with science.\nThe genre is often criticised for its lack of\nscientific accuracy. I think that this is quite un-fair: science fiction is just that, fiction. If I want\nto learn something I pick up a textbook, not a\nStar Wars DVD.\nI believe that the main purpose of this genre\nis to try to predict the future, to describe how\npeople will adapt to the new technology in this\nfuture and, most importantly, to entertain.\nA good grasp of science may help in the first\ntwo of these goals, though, since the future is\nso unpredictable, even this may not always be\nthe case, but it certainly does not help in the\nthird.\nBeing scientifically accurate isn\u2019t a requirement for a good story. Hardly anybody would\nargue that The Matrix was a bad film despite\nthe ridiculous concept of machines using human brains as a power source. Conversely, last\nyear\u2019s Moon won wide acclaim for its plausibility but I found it almost unwatchable due to\nthe antagonists\u2019 completely illogical actions.\nFar more important than science are interesting\ncharacters and a good plot.\nThat is why the one demand that I do make\nof science fiction is that its made-up science be\nat least logical and easy to understand. I hate\nthe \u2018technobabble\u2019 so commonly found in Star\nTrek and Doctor Who.\nIt adds nothing to the story to have the characters spouting nonsensical and vaguely tech-nical-sounding words for half of an episode.\nIt also takes away all dramatic tension if you\nknow that however perilous the situation it will\nprobably be solved by some never-before-seen\nand never-again-to-be-mentioned technology.\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like Star Trek and Doctor\nWho: I just think that they\u2019re at their best when\nthey tone down their \u2018science\u2019.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, my favourite sub-genre\nof science fiction is the so called \u2018hard SF\u2019,\nwhere believability and scientific accuracy are\nthe most important factors. It can be very refreshing to get away from the bug-eyed monsters so prevalent in the sci-fi that most people\nare familiar with and see characters dealing\nwith such mundane restrictions as the speed of\nlight.\nBut I also appreciate the far greater scope\nthat breaking a few rules of physics gives, such\nas intrigues spanning galactic empires and epic\nspace battles. I guess that I just like the best of\nboth worlds.\nMaciej Matuszewski\nScience\nFiction\nColumn\nI for one would rather eat Daisy (pictured) than save the planet by eating vegetables.\n\n"

It was clear that they\nhad a strong musical focus, \u201cBollywood is the\nsoul of India, it has the same purpose as soul\nmusic, the identity thing, the liberation thing,\u201d\nand for the Western band members who had\nnever heard Bollywood before, funk and soul\ninstantly worked with it. They also told me that\nalthough they were excited about the launch\nof their debut album (\u2018The Soul of Bollwood\u2019,\nlaunched that very night), to them the band is\nall about the live gigs.\nAs soon as they got going Ajay had the BolMUSIC\nFELIX\n28\nMusic Editors: Greg Power\nLuke Turner\nChristopher Walmsley\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nAlbum of The Week\nMy Chemical\nRomance\nDanger Days: The\nTrue Lives of the\nFabulous Killjoys\nReprise Records\n2010\nThe album that launched MCR\u2019s career into the strato-sphere, 2006\u2019s The Black Parade, saw the band finally\nrealising their ambitions of Queen-inspired grandiose\npop anthems. In my opinion it was full of flaws \u2013 and\na huge step back from their 2004 masterpiece, Three\nCheers For Sweet Revenge \u2013 but the gloomy cancer-centric concept of the album struck a chord with the\nemo masses. They scrapped the album they were\nmaking for a year, and vocalist Gerard Way came up\nwith a new concept for the album, about a reckless\ncrew of freedom fighters living in a post-apocalyptic\nworld ruled by vampire cyborgs. Or something. The\nresult is a genre-blending and infectious reconciliation of their earlier Misfits-tinged gothic punk and\ntheir recent venture into stadium rock. It\u2019s catchy, up-beat, full of great lyrics and a true joy to rock out to.\nCheck out \u201cParty Poison\u201d, \u201cVampire Blood\u201d, or watch\nthe \u201cNa Na Na...\u201d video to see the cyberpunk princes\nin their full glory.

After\nfive brilliant albums, including the now seminal Toxicity and their Mezmerize/Hypnotize double-album\nconcept piece, SOAD have a ton of brilliant, raw,\nheavy and downright weird material to draw from.\nTheir live performances are legendary \u2013 guitarist\nDaron Malakian usually writhes around on stage,\nmessed up on some sort of horse medication \u2013\nand with the added bonus of being millionaires\nthey\u2019ll probably have an insane stage show too.\nGreg Power\nThere has always been one paradoxical quote\nabout Weezer that amused me. I\u2019m paraphras-ing, but it goes along the lines that \u201cWeezer\nare the worst rock band in America to release\ntwo of the greatest albums of the last 20\nyears\u201d.\nWhilst I disagree, it\u2019s easy to understand why\nthey might be labeled as such. After the initial\ndisappointment of their comeback Green Album in 2001, and the series of pitfalls along the\nway (Parts of Red and Hurley, all of Make Believe and Raditude) you\u2019d probably be thinking\nit\u2019s a miracle if Weezer had any followers left.\nYet you\u2019d be surprised to find a community of\ndedicated, and often frustrated, people who\ntruly love this band.\nIt comes down to one album: Pinkerton.\nComing from a troubled past, it has become the\nalbatross that hangs around the bands\u2019 collective neck. A blessing in that it is quite simply\na work of genius, and a curse in that they have\nnever been able to follow it up.\nOriginally spawned as a space rock opera\nnamed Songs from the Black Hole, it morphed\ninto a quasi-concept album based around Madame Butterfly and was a swift departure from\ntheir eponymous debut\u2019s geek power pop.

But even these\nwere distorted and made darker, becoming obsessed with sex, heartbreak, and what Japanese\nschool girls get up to in their spare time (if you\ncatch my drift).\nLargely ignored by the press when it was first\nreleased, it was both a commercial and critical\nflop, and placed #1 on Rolling Stones\u2019 worst\nalbum of 1996 list. The band retreated into hiatus for the next five years, and nothing more\nwas heard of the Weez. But by some miracle,\nover those five years the album began gathering steam by itself, slowly gaining recognition\nwith both fans and critics, and went on to become one of the biggest sleeper hits ever con-ceived.\nNow, a full 14 years later the album is being\nreissued and re-mastered as a 2 CD, 36 track\nalbum of odds and ends. The B-Sides and unreleased tracks from this era remain of a ludicrously high quality: \u201cDevotion\u201d feels heavy\nand sluggish to the verge of breaking point,\nbut somehow works. New track \u201cGetting Up\nand Leaving\u201d, only heard before from the Not\nAlone concert where frontman Rivers Cuomo\nperformed it acapella is a lost Weezer classic.\nAnd that\u2019s not forgetting the Coda version of\n\u201cLongtime Sunshine\u201d, or the end cap of the album \u201cTragic Girl\u201d.\nHowever, what\u2019s most striking upon listening again is that it hasn\u2019t aged. Opener \u201cTired\nOf Sex\u201d is still as debauched; the chorus of\n\u201cEl Scorcho\u201d still has the same fist in the air,\nfeel good factor; the bass of \u201cGetchoo\u201d full\non rawk; the closing chords of \u201cButterfly\u201d a\nsting of regret. It\u2019s abrasive, blistering, and at\ntimes uncomfortable, but beneath these layers\nlies an incredibly personal, humourous and\nemotive album that is utterly relatable. So if\nyou\u2019re a Weezer veteran, recovering addict,\nor only know \u201cBeverly Hills\u201d (Shudder...\n(Editor\u2019s note: Shame on you!)) then this is\nan essential purchase for the coming wintery\nmonths.\nFRIDAY 03 decEMBER 2010\n\n"

Their fortunes\nchanged in the plate and they beat their\ntwo Cambridge rivals to see them take\nthird place. Tommy Fagen and partner\npassed through the quarter finals without\nincident but in a cruel twist of fate found\nthemselves against the same Cambridge\nfirst pair that kept them from the top spot\nin the pools.\nAfter a long couple of games the pair\nfound themselves out of the competi-tion. Congratulations to the pair who\nachieved a top 4 position out of the 34\npair turnout. In the girls competition we\nare proud of the London first pair who\nbeat Oxford in the finals; the first time\nOxbridge hasn\u2019t taken the prize.\nFives is an extremely fast growing\nsport, only now breaking out of the\nsecondary school mould; we have just\nformed a Fives society to catering from\nall forms of fives and one wall hand-ball.\nIf you want to try this unique, friendly\nand social sport, contact the fives society at fivesclub@imperial.ac.uk which\nallowing you to be placed our mailing\nlists so you can be kept up to date with\nupcoming events.

However, captain Lucie\u2019s Christmas themed team joke of the\nday set the girls in good spirits for the\ngame.\nPlay started poorly for Imperial with\nBrunel overturning their first centre\nand scoring.

Some people prefer the somewhat\nmore reductionist \u2018circuit\u2019, bouncing\nbetween Thailand\u2019s infamous full moon\nparties on Koh Phangan and tubing in\nLaos\u2019 Vang Vieng.\nVang Vieng is a tiny lethargic village\nsat alongside the Mekong River, surrounded by a scrum of beautiful mountains and plenty of rice paddies. When\nyou look at it from a moral standpoint\nthe thoughts are certainly sombre, as it\u2019s\na real indication of the perils tourism\ncan inflict on otherwise savvy destina-tions. Unfortunately the fun and games\non offer here aren\u2019t truly Laotian and\noften people miss the point of visiting\nthis country. It\u2019s like visiting Amsterdam and spending all of your time in a\ncoffee shop: extremely fun but not the\nbe-all and end-all.\nAfter a 27 hour bus ride on the infamous \u2018death bus\u2019 (curse you, pledge of\nno unnecessary overland flights) from\nHanoi and a stopover in Laos\u2019 sleepy\ncapital Vientianne, the chaos that this\nplace offered was certainly welcomed.\nI\u2019d left my previous clan to do some\ntrekking, as they\u2019d decided to stay put\nin a city to watch a world cup game (that\nwe lost, naturally), so I had to go on a\nbit of a recruitment mission. If there\u2019s\none place where travelling solo is a big\nno-no it\u2019s here, so I formed a fellowship\non the bus with a couple of crazies who\nturned out to be a good laugh. In partic-ular, Fearny, who sported an extensive\ncollection of naked photos from various\nwonders of the world.\nWe checked in to a quaint little guesthouse in town, dumped all of our stuff\nand grabbed a taxi upstream. Tubing involves floating the three kilometres back\ndown the Mekong towards Vang Vieng,\ninside an inflatable ring, stopping off at\nthe various bars on your way down. The\naccident rate here is alarmingly high, but\nthanks to no concept of health and safety\nit\u2019s not been shut down: monsoon season resulted in some even more interesting experiences as the currents were at\nwarp speed.\nBy the time we made it up there at\nnoon the party was in full swing as shot\nglasses were continually refilled and endless dubstep blared. It all kicks off at the\nimaginatively-named \u2018Bar One\u2019 where\nyou can plunge from 20 metres from a\ntree swing into the fast-flowing muddy\nriver below. I\u2019d been warned about the\nrocks and diseases but was determined\nto ignore the sensible advice, until I saw\na girl total herself on a bed of rocks as\nsoon as we arrived. Thankfully the bartender doubled up as a doctor and had\nher shipped back to town (where there\u2019s\nno hospital), and then the music resumed\nas everyone proceeded to \u2018get on it\u2019.\nScattered along the river at regular\nintervals are little wooden shacks, serving a wide array of drinks, snacks and\nshishas. Stationed at each is a dastardly\n\u2018looky-looky man\u2019 who\u2019ll lure you in\nby tossing you a rope and pulling you\nashore. You can drink for free all the\nway down as long as you\u2019re willing to\nstick to the snake, scorpion and hornet\nwhiskies, which is exactly what I did\n(tight budget and all). If you think that\nexcessive drinking and swimming are\nterrible activities to combine, you\u2019d be\nright \u2013 even more so when we decided\nparticipate in the fun mud-based tug-o-war and volleyball.\nSo the process of drifting downstream\ncontinued into the early evening as we\ngot more and more out of breath. Some\nof the bars offer delicious treats that\nany child would love in a goody bag:\nmushroom muffins, heroin cookies and\nthe like. Some of the more \u2018hardcore\u2019\npeople there decided that these would be\nthe real cherry on the danger cake, and\nin their stupor missed the final collection\npoint downstream and ended up in lands\nafar only to have to walk back throughout the night, getting repeatedly bitten\nby mosquitoes along the way no doubt.\nWe made the final dock and headed into\ntown for the after party.\nI guess it\u2019s a bit like freshers\u2019week, but\nwith a lot more drinking. You wake up at\n11, head upstream, drink all day, then get\nback into town and begin the bar crawl\nthat goes on well until the early hours.\nWhile the town lacks a Charlie\u2019s Kebab\nthe resident sandwich stalls are truly terrific \u2013mouth-watering bacon with melted\ncheese and any sauce you\u2019d like awaits\nyour drunken self as you stagger out of\nthe bars at sunrise. For some people this\nroutine continues for weeks but for me a\nfew days was enough, and surprisingly I\neven managed to squeeze in some more\n\u2018cultural\u2019 activities.\nThe surrounding landscapes are truly\nbreathtaking and easily explored by bi-cycle. We took off for the day in search\nof the \u2018blue lagoon\u2019, a remote little spot\nout in the forest. What makes it even\nmore difficult to locate are the several\nfalse signs on the way, intentionally\nset up to trap tourists into visiting other\n\u2018lagoons\u2019. A day of cycling through the\nbeautiful rice paddies was just awesome\nas we got to interact with many of the\nvillagers and see so many great sights.\nEasily the best sight of the day was being honoured the position of photographer by Fearny, who wanted to broaden\nhis blossoming penis portfolio.\nConjunctivitis was at an all time high\nwhile I was there, what with everyone\nlacking an active immune system and\nsharing needles (well, beds). Thankfully\nI invested the 20p in eye drops as a precautionary measure so managed to avoid\nthe unpleasantness. I did however have\na slight near-death experience when I\nattempted kayaking further upstream:\nSteph and I were the epitome of complacency and failed to acknowledge the\nimpending rapids and proceeded to capsize into a thorny tree. I\u2019ve never felt as\nstupid as I did when the bag containing\nour passports, cameras and bank cards\nfloated downstream, but thanks to some\nemergency whistles we were rescued\nand the bag was recovered unscathed.\nJust to top off the hilarity, we made\nit the 20km downstream to the bars and\ndecided to get as drunk as possible. We\nwere about to migrate to the next bar\nvia the inviting rickety bridge, only to\nsee a screaming girl fall through said\nbridge and get carried away by the cur-rents. At that point we decided that we\u2019d\nhead back and unwind with a massage\nand quit while we still had our lives (and\npassports). Massages there were cheap\nand brutal \u2013 a truly winning combina-tion. My only qualm is that upon refusal\nof cheeky extras the brutality peaked\nand I left the parlour in more pain than\nwhen I entered: standard. I plonked my\nbackpack on my achy spine and hopped\non the bus north in search of waterfalls\nand monasteries.\nthat we\u2019d swim down and not bother\npaying for the inflatable rings. And\nalong the way we continued to plunge\nfrom swings and slides into the river and\n\u201cIf you think that excessive drinking and\nswimming are terrible\nactivities to combine,\nyou\u2019d be right\u201d\nChris Richardson\nVoluptuous blondes await your charm and charisma\nYou!

It made sense\nwe\u2019d pay homage to our\nnewly adopted family and\ncelebrate Christmas together with the\nbasting of an oversized bird and a vat\nfull of mulled wine. A good excuse to\nreminisce about the first term\u2019s antics\n(with much naming and shaming), get\na little snozzled and eat pig wrapped\nin pig; hall Christmas dinner is not to\nbe missed.

After a term of partying hard and sleeping little, our palates were more familiar with Kentucky\nFried than home-roasted, and our culinary skills hadn\u2019t quite reached their full\npotential. Nevertheless someone on our\nstaircase took on the Delia challenge and\nmade an amazing job of it. Once you\u2019ve\nworked out the correct time to cook the\nbird given its weight, it\u2019s actually not\nthat scary. Here\u2019s a flavour packed recipe that is easily adapted to chicken:\n2 Bunches of thyme or lemon thyme\n1 Orange\n1 Lemon\n8 tbsp Olive oil\n4.5-5.6kg/10-12lbturkey, thawed if fro-zen, giblets removed\n4 Bay leaves\n4 Carrots, halved lengthways and cut\ninto chunks\n1 Large onion roughly chopped\n50g Butter\nStuffing (homemade or bought)\nChop the leafy tops of the thyme (set\naside the woody branches for later).\nFinely grate orange and lemon zest into\nthe same bowl. Add olive oil and sea-soning, mash the mix with a spoon to active the flavours and set aside to infuse.\nHeat the oven to 190C/Gas5. Put the\nstuffing into the neck of the bird and\npush it towards the breast. Stuffing will\nexpand when cooking, so don\u2019t overfill!\nSecure the neck flap with a skewer.\nWeigh the stuffed turkey and calculate\nthe cooking time (18 mins per 450g).\nSeason the turkey generously inside\nand out. Halve the orange and lemon\nand put it in the cavity, (squeeze the fruit\nas it goes in) along with the remaining\nthyme branches and 2 bay leaves.\nPut the chopped carrots, onion and remaining bay leaves into a large roasting\ntin. Sit the turkey on top of the vegetables and smear the butter over the skin.\nFor a really tender turkey you can add\nthe same amount of butter under the skin\nfrom the neck.\nCover with a loose tent of foil. Roast\nthe turkey for the calculated time, basting with the pan juices every hour. Half\nan hour before the turkey\u2019s ready remove the foil and leave to brown. After\n15 mins drizzle with the thyme oil.\nHow to know if the turkey is cooked:\nInsert a skewer into the thickest part of\nthe thigh. The juices should run clear. If\nthey\u2019re still pink, then cook for a further\n20-30mins and test again. A turkey of\nthis size should take about 3 \u00bd hrs.\nPerfect Roasties\nRoast potatoes make or break a Sunday\nroast for me. Should Christmas dinner\ndisaster strike, the loss of the turkey\nwould be nothing compared to the loss of\nperfectly golden crunchy on the outside,\nfluffy on the inside roasties. Some people swear by goose or duck fat. Whilst\nrunning out to the Serpentine might be\na cost effective method of acquiring our\nown, as students, I think butter will do\njust fine. My trick is a mixture of vegetable oil for crispiness and animal fat\nfor flavour with a sprinkling of flour to\ncreate those extra crunchy edges.\n16 Potatoes (Desiree, King Edward,\nMaris Pipers are all good)\n2 tbsp Plain flour\n150g Butter/Goose or Duck fat/dripping\n3 tbsp Sunflower or vegetable oil\nSalt for seasoning\nHeat over to 190C. Peel potatoes\nand cut in half or leave whole if they\u2019re\nsmall. I recommend leaving them relatively large so they\u2019re manageable.\nIn a saucepan cover with cold water\nand bring to the boil. Allow to boil for\n2 mins.\nDrain and then toss in the colander to\nfluff up their surfaces. This will create\nthat crunch. Sprinkle over the flour as\nyou go and finish with a good sprinkle\nof salt for seasoning.\nOn the hob, place a large roasting\ntray over high heat and add the fat and\noil. When sizzling add the potatoes and\nbrown for 5mins, turning occasionally\nso that all sides are covered in fat and\ngetting a bit of colour.\nRoast for an hour, taking the tray out\nevery 20 mins and turning the potatoes\nto allow them to cook evenly.\nA STUDENT\u2019S GUIDE: HOW TO... DO HALL CHRISTMAS DINNER\nGet together before term ends with yet more wine and a huge bird: By Nadia Paes\nRoasted Autumn Veg\nWhen the mulled wine is flowing and\nyou\u2019re panicking trying to cook your\nfirst ever turkey, a one roasting dish recipe like this makes life a little easier. It\ncombines all the usual Christmas dinner\nsuspects; carrots, parsnips, red onion and\npotatoes. But infused with thyme and\nwhole garlic cloves roasted in their skins,\nsuddenly veg is no longer a dreaded obstacle to the meaty star of the Christmas\ndinner plate. With minimal preparation,\nyou can throw them all in a pan together\nand once in the oven can forget about\nthem until you\u2019re ready to serve.\n8 Large carrots\n5 Parnips\n100g of New Potatoes\n4 Red onions\nCloves of 1 bulb of garlic, in their skins\n6 Springs of thyme\n5 tbsp of vegetable oil\nSalt and pepper to season\nCut the carrots and parsnips into chunky\nportions (batons 1.5 x 1.5cm, 5cm in\nlength).\nQuarter the red onions. Cut in half again\nif they are large onions.\nSlice the new potatoes in half. Leave\nwhole if they are small.\nPeel the outer layer of the garlic and\nseparate into cloves, leaving them in\ntheir skins.\nCombine all in a roasting tray. Pour\nover the oil and seasoning and evenly\nspread the thyme throughout the tray.\nToss the vegetables to ensure even coating in oil.\nRoast in an oven at 190\u02daC for 1hr 15\nmins. Toss at regular intervals.\nGarnish with fresh thyme and/or\nchopped fresh parsley when you serve.\nOur Sunday\nRoast Menu\nPork tenderloin with mushroom and herb stuffing.\nSalmon with a herb crust.\nRoast potatoes.\nApricot and hazelnut stuffing balls wrapped in streaky\nbacon.\nPigs in blankets.\nRoasted autumn vegetables.\nMinted peas.\nBraised red cabbage with\ncider and apples.\nCeleriac and pear winter\ncoleslaw.\nBlackberry and poached pear\ncrumble.\nSurvival Time\nplan\nWith a floor or staircase of people\nhelping, prep should be done in\nno time. Then you can get down\nto the real business: hanging out\nand having a team mulled wine.\nGetting everything ready for the\nsame time can be harder than it\nlooks, but here\u2019s a rough plan to\nhelp get things rolling:\n10am Preheat the oven to 190\u02daC/\nGas 5. The turkey should ideally\nbe at room temperature. Prepare\nthe turkey and put it in the oven.\n10.30am Get your mulled wine\non\u2026 it makes the next few hours\nwhizz by and gets even the most\nhung over on your corridor drifting into the kitchen.\n11am Start prepping all of your\nveg. Store potatoes and sprouts in\nbowls of water until they\u2019re ready\nto be cooked. Make stuffing balls\nand pigs in blankets. Store in the\nfridge until ready to be cooked.\n11.30am The turkey should have\nhad its first hour. Remove from\nthe oven, baste and return to the\noven foiled. Repeat an hour later.\n1pm Get your roasted veg into\nthe oven. Start boiling your roast\npotatoes and get them in the oven\nwhen you\u2019re ready.\n1.30pm Turn your roast potatoes\nand give your roasted veg a quick\ntoss. Pop stuffing balls and pigs in\nblankets in the oven at this point.\n2pm Take your turkey out.\nCheck if it\u2019s cooked and leave to\nrest for half an hour. Start making\nyour gravy.\n2.15pm Put some sprouts on to\ncook in a pan of boiling water.\n2.20pm Whack some frozen\npeas on. They\u2019re quick and\neasy and Christmas dinner just\nwouldn\u2019t be right without them.\n2.30pm SERVE!!\n\n"

You\nfork out \u00a320 to go and see a\nreally exciting new band at\nBrixton Academy or HMV\nForum. You then queue for ages in the\ncold. Once you\u2019re in the venue\u2019s sound\nsystem sounds like it\u2019s playing through\nfour inches of cotton wool and a sweaty\nseven foot yeti man decides to stand half\nan inch in front of your face. Sigh. It\u2019s\nnot always that bad, but there is another\nway to see live bands that is cheaper,\nmore intimate and often has better quality music than the main concert halls.\nTucked away down side streets, in basements and attics away from the crowds,\nsmall gig venues give you the opportunity to see the bands that will be playing\nthe big venues in a year or two\u2019s time\nup close and personal at a fraction of the\nprice. Here are a few of the best ones:\nMadame Jojo\u2019s:\n10 Brewer street, Soho\nOrdinarily, this venue is host to a slea-Hidden treasures\nIn this new series Charlotte Ridler picks out the best venues in\nLondon for gigging off the beaten track\nBeach House\nSheperd\u2019s Bush Empire\n23rd November 2010\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nTytus Murphy\nATTICS &\nBASEMENTS\nBeloved by Pitchfork, Jay-Z and Beyonce as well as your humble reviewer,\nBeach House are a well regarded twosome emanating from Baltimore that\ncomprise of Alex Scally and Victoria\nLegrand. This scruffy and seductive pair\nhave been riding an ever-growing wave\nof critical adoration since 2004 which\nnow appears to be translating into a wider commercial acclaim, as evidenced by\nhealthy sales of their beautifully beguiling 2010-released LP Teen Dream and\ntheir sell-out gig at the Shepherd\u2019s Bush\nEmpire.\nOpening with \u2018Glia\u2019, Beach House\ninstantly do more than simply reproduce\nthe layered textures of their distinctive\n\u2018dream pop\u2019sound on record, in the flesh\nthe intricacy and beauty of their sound is\nfully realised. Scally\u2019s guitar parts and\neffects linger delicately providing the\nperfect foundation for the most distinctive element of Beach House to shine,\nthat is Legrand\u2019s sumptuous drawn-out\nhusky voice.\nLegrand could be the ghost of the Velvet Underground\u2019s Nico: her vocals\nhave the very same low and powerful\nresonance, which \u2013 despite their limited\nrange \u2013 fixate you, sucking you into the\nrealm of this enigmatic femme fatale. Legrand cuts a captivating presence, pitched\nsomewhere between a youthful Horsesera Patti Smith with swathes of messy\nblack hair and the subtle swagger of Cat\nPower, she captures the hazy melodic\nrhythms of her band with elegant sways.\nTeen Dream is showcased in its en-tirety, fragmented by early singles such\nas 2008\u2019s \u2018Heart of Chambers\u2019, allowing the set to flow smoothly. Highlights\ninclude \u2018Better Times\u2019 and \u2018Used To\nBe\u2019, the former beginning with wonderfully simple repetition of a piano chord\nand is a slow-burner climaxing with\nLegrand crying out: \u2018The one that you\nlove is gone\u2019. \u2018Used To Be\u2019 is cut from\nthe same cloth, with Legrand hauntingly\nwarning: \u2018Don\u2019t forget the nights, when\nit all felt right\u2019.\nThe ambient quality of the music of\nBeach House is typified by \u2018Zebra\u2019, this\nabstract hymn is delivered with tremendous energy, beginning with infectious\nguitar and lengthened high-pitched organ soundscapes. This breath-taking\ntrack builds and builds, becoming soni-cally more and more expansive but never\nlosing its sense of melody, with Legrand\nagain at the fore, echoing: \u2018Anyway you\nrun, you run before us, black and white\nhorse, arching among us\u2019.\nThere is little conversing with the appreciative crowd, a notable exception\nbeing Legrand metaphorically remarking that together in our collective at-Beach House are the cherry on the cake\nThe sultry Legrand of Beach\nHouse brought the room to a\nstandstill\nzy strip club, but on Tuesday nights it\nsees some of the most exciting breaking\nbands from all over the world gracing\nits doors for the excellent White Heat\nClub. You usually pay \u00a35 to go down\ninto the faintly lit basement, where three\nor four bands will play up on a curtained\npodium with DJs afterwards. Names\nsuch as The xx, Wild Beasts, Dan Le\nSac, Noah and the Whale and The\nKills have been on the billing before.\nThe Lexington:\n96-98 Pentonville Road\nThe Lexington is basically a pub for\nhipsters. Downstairs is the main pub\narea, which has some pretty crazy d\u00e9cor with chandeliers, buffalo skulls on\nthe walls and big fancy sofas, making\nit look like a baroque hunting lounge.\nDJs play great music, the bar specialises in American brewed beverages and\nyou can even get some hearty pub food.\nClimb the spiral staircase up to the attic and there is a second bar and gig\nvenue where bands play most nights.\nPrices can be very variable, but if you\nkeep your eye out there are a few free\nalbum launches held there, and White\nLight (the sister club to Madame Jojo\u2019s\nWhite Heat) is held every Friday, with\nDJs playing until late afterwards.\ntendance we are part of a \u2018good cake\u2019,\nappropriately bowing in reverence to\nthe crowd. This evening is quite a big\ndeal for the Baltimore duo, their biggest\nshow to date and they seem keen to earn\nthese stripes, playing with real urgency,\nverve and intensity throughout.\nThe set culminates with \u2018Take Care\u2019,\nan alluring and serene song that waxes\nand wanes with power and grace. Just as\nit majestically closes the LP it makes a\nperfect closer this evening.\nHowever this was not to be the fitting\nending as the pair returned for an encore\nincluding the epic \u201810 Mile Stereo\u2019. I\nwas a little underwhelmed by the \u2018big\nfinish\u2019 nature of the encore, backed with\npulsating percussion and screeching\nkeys, for Beach House are most impressive when they hold back, allowing Legrand to take centre stage. Nonetheless,\nit was a commanding performance, with\nstripes fully acquired and definitely well\nworth the hype.\nHorse and Condor at Madame Jojo\u2019s\nThe Book Club:\n100 Leonard Street, Shoreditch\nThis one is a really eclectic and crazy\nvenue: it always offers something unusual and fun. You never really get a\nbog standard gig here. DJ sessions or\nBand nights can be accompanied by arts\nand crafts nights, film showings, life\ndrawing classes, spoken word poetry or\nanything in between, and prices range\nfrom free gigs and \u00a31 gigs to more expensive nights up to a tenner. They also\nhost an infamous Electro Swing night\nwhere club goers dance their feet off to\nDJs sampling 1920\u2019s tunes with hip hop\nbeats.\nThat\u2019s just a sample of the great fun\nthat can be had on a budget and the\nfantastic hidden treasures of London\u2019s\nsmall gig venues. If you like the sound\nof the venues above and are looking\nfor people to head out to these places\nto with, feel free to message Imperial\nAlternative Music Society at alt.mu-sic@ic.ac.uk and you can come along\nwith us.\nIf you want to share a\nmind-blowing playlist\nsend it in to\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nChristopher Walmsley\nCharlotte Ridler\nFRIDAY 03 decemBER 2010\n\n"

It seems\nonly natural, then, for people to start\ntaking fashion into their own hands, and\nout of the perfectly manicured talons of\nthe fashion editrixes at Vogue and the\nlike. Such is the world of fashion blog-ging. Now very popular, just a few have\ngained a loyal following, and even fewer have earned endorsements from the\nheavy-hitters in the fashion world \u2013 PRs\nand designers alike \u2013 gaining entry into\nrunway shows and press days alongside\nthe very editors who have always held\nfashion at arms reach, on the page of a\nmagazine, on the body of a supermodel.\nThe scope of fashion blogs range\nfrom street style blogs, where budding\nfashion photographers roam the streets\nin search of the sartorially inspired, to\npersonal style blogs, where individuals\nexhibit their own inspirational styling.\nWhat is so special about them though, is\nthe fact that each is completely unique;\nanyone interested in fashion can find a\nfashion blog that appeals - and if you\ncan\u2019t, start one up yourself!\nSome of my personal favourites are\nbelow \u2013 though I implore you to take a\nlook for yourself, and find yourself inspired without having to flick though the\npages of a magazine.\nFashion Toast Sea of Shoes\nClothes Whisperer\nThe Sartorialist\nRumi Neely, personal style blogger behind\nFashion Toast, is one of the pioneers in\nmaking fashion blogging a career. Spawned\nfrom her blog has come a modelling contract with US fashion giant Forever 21, a\njewellery collection with Dannijo and a capsule wardrobe collection with RVCA, whose\nprevious collaborators have included supermodel Erin Wasson. Her signature is effortless SoCal style \u2013 loose, draped lines,\nan excess of heavy metal jewllery \u2013 rings\nand necklaces are a favourite \u2013 combined\nwith unexpected designer accents: Chlo\u00e9\nplatform boots, Dolce and Gabbana wedges or an Alexander Wang Diego bag. The\nsecret behind her huge popularity is her\npenchant for accessible fashion - Topshop,\nZara, H&M and thrifted/vintage pieces feature heavily, making a clear case for fashion being for everyone, not just for those\nwho can afford it.\nwww.fashiontoast.com\nKristin Knox, fashion writer, author and\nproud owner of an MPhil from Oxford, has\ncornered the market on an intellectual approach to fashion with her fabulously witty\nwriting and flawless New York-comes-toLondon style. With posts ranging from in-depth runway analysis (scholar-style) to her\nsignature Style Whispering (photoshoots\nin designers\u2019 showrooms, putting her own\nspin on their current collections), each one\nprovides a peek into the world of fashion.\nFunny, envy-inducing and always truthful,\nin addition to the innumerable pictures rife\nin all fashion blogs, Kristin\u2019s is one of the\nonly blogs out there whose text is actually\nworth reading. Particularly entertaining are\nher posts on the \u201cChampagne and Canap\u00e9\nDiet\u201d - a self-admitted fashion addict, Kristin prefers to spend her cash on clothes\nthan food, and so, makes the most of the\nfantastic spreads provided at press days!\nwww.theclotheswhisperer.co.uk\nOne for the gentlemen, The Sartorialist is\narguably the most famous of all fashion\nblogs. Scott Schuman is a New York-based\nstreet style photographer with an eye for\nclassically elegant sartorial style. His particular favourite subjects include Milanese\ngentlemen (clad in bespoke three-piece\nsuits, complete with cravats, leather gloves\nand perfectly formed handmade brogues),\ncute New York girls on bicycles and Anna\nDello Russo and the Vogue Nippon editorial\nteam (wearing super-luxe designer couture\n\u2013 fresh off the catwalk, of course).

A fellow\nappreciator of the very finest in footwear, it\nwould seem that Kanye enjoys Jane\u2019s flam-boyant, too-much-is-never-enough vintage/\ndesigner style. Her personal style posts\nare always rich in colour and luxurious tex-tures; both Jane and her mother are collectors of all things fashion: from vintage\ncouture to the most unusual accessories\n(they both have something of a fetish for\nanimal jewellery).

What\ngarbage have they thrown at us\nthis week? Oh hurrah, we\u2019re going to be able to reverse the aging process. And no doubt, by the time the\nmainstream media has finished bouncing on this story like Berlusconi on\na power hungry teenie-bopper; we will be queuing up in our thousands\nto have this wonder enzyme pumped into our bodies. Let\u2019s get one thing\nstraight: if I earn enough money, I will probably get plastic surgery when\nI\u2019m older to sort myself out.\nMy opponent in this head-to-head is lucky that he is Chinese. Anyone\nwho has seen a Kung-fu film will know that Chinese people can only\nlook one way when they get old, and that way is awesome. Crazy mous-tache, little goatee and an ability to look good in a dress with sandals\nand socks, the Far East Asians are like a fine merlot when it comes to\nageing. I, however, am from the Middle East. When my people get old,\nthey grow jowls, and wrinkles deep enough to use as CD racks. Now as\nI\u2019m sure you can tell from the photo above this article, I am a damn handsome man. A little problem with acne that crops up when it gets cold, but\notherwise, I\u2019ve got the package baby. Monobrow, nicotine stained teeth,\nweirdly small ears and frizzy hair: it\u2019s a classic look that\u2019s never going\naway; and I would never let any concept of growing old gracefully ever\nprevent me from preserving it.\n\u201cAnd what of the non-aesthetic reasons for preventing ageing, you vain\nprick?\u201d you may ask. We are all getting older and the government is\nnow getting us to work till we\u2019re 70 before we can get a one way ticket\nto the drain-on-the-state-finances-express queue at the post office each\nweek. Ignoring the fact that this trumped up miracle cure will ravage\nus all with cancer before we can even surprise our friends by seducing\ntheir kids with our fresh young faces, it is ridiculous that we can reject a\ngenuine proposal to \u201ccheat death\u201d, or at least have us ticking over very\nnicely until the sudden, final gasp. I mean, have you ever seen children?\nThey\u2019re fucking horrible, messy things that bite and piss themselves. Or\nteenagers? You know how obnoxious and annoying freshers are, right?\nThey\u2019re like that but worse.\nYouth is wasted on the young, and experience is wasted on the old.Any\nchance we get to redress that situation by doing away with the irritating,\ntake-forever-to-get-off-the-bus shit that comes with age will make this a\nperfect utopian society for all.\n24 felix\nCOMMENT\nComment Editor: Anna Perman\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nL\net\u2019s start by confirming the fact that what\nscientists managed\nto achieve with those\nmice will probably\nnever be emulated in humans.\nCall me a sceptic, but let\u2019s call\noff all hope for any sort of bona\nfide \u2018reverse-aging treatment\u2019 for\nhumans in the foreseeable future. I\nmean, we\u2019re so far away from translating this experiment from mice to\nhumans, we\u2019ll all be dead by the time it\u2019s a realistic occurrence. These\nHarvard scientists were barely capable of reversing age, never mind res-urrection. So, sit back down, close your mouth back up and calm down\nfor now.\nHowever, back to a hypothetical world we go.\nReverse-aging would make life unfair. More unfair than it already is.\nAs a final year student currently looking for any dregs of the job market\nthat I can call \u2018employment\u2019, I do not want to be competing against an\n140-year-old for jobs. He\u2019d absolutely hammer me in a head-to-head\ninterview situation with all the wisdom he\u2019s gained from, quite frankly,\nmore than his fair share of life. I\u2019m ignorant and immature enough, thank\nyou very much. I count on people around me being more na\u00efve, insensitive and uncultured than myself. Life runs in relativity: stand next to\nPeter Crouch, you\u2019re going to look short (like a Borrower in my case);\nstand next to Graham Norton, you\u2019re going to look positively butch (I\u2019d\nprobably struggle with this one); stand next to Katie Price, you\u2019re going\nto seem like Einstein (I\u2019m a Biologist and Matt\u2019s a Material Scientist,\nthis last analogy isn\u2019t working).\nSexual selection is one of the evolutionary drivers of the human race\u2019s\nsustainment. It\u2019d be horrifically unfair if the female population were forever subject to a 20 year old Hugh Heffner and his planet-sized libido.\nNo other man would stand a chance. Hugh would end up being the father\nto even more children than he probably already is. Does that sound like\nutopia to you?\nGrowing old doesn\u2019t scare me. Having youth on my side is great and\nall that. But I look forward to the mid-life crisis, bus seat offerings and\ncolostomy bags. I hate having to wash myself in the bath; when you\u2019re\nold, someone else does it for you. Life as an elder statesman sounds like\nTHE life, and if fate wishes to take me there, who am I stop it? Plus, I\u2019ve\nplanned my mid-life crisis and I\u2019m buying myself three in-house prostitutes and whatever four-seater Volkswagen is all the rage by then. There\nare so many benefits of getting old, see?\nHaving youth in a pill sounds great, but it\u2019s not for me thanks. Oh, why\nam I bothering? This argument is futile. It won\u2019t bloody happen anyway.\n\u201cYouth is wasted\non the young,\nand experience is\nwasted on the old\u201d\nMatt Allinson\n\u201cReverse-aging\nwould make life\nunfair. More unfair\nthan it already is\u201d\nHidden behind a computer\nscreen:The psychological\neffects of distancing\nthrough the internet\nDan Wan\nPeople find it easier to express their\nfeelings \u2018hidden\u2019 behind their computer\nscreens. They can confess things to people that they would never talk about face to\nface, like suppressed feelings or personal\nthoughts. So how exactly did people communicate before the internet?\nHowever, the distancing effects of Information Technology have drawbacks as well.\nPeople tend to trust strangers that they\nhave met in chat rooms or in Facebook,\nmore than in other situations of every day\nlife. For example, many people expose their\npersonal details and private moments to\npeople all over the world over the internet\nwithout consideration. but they would get\nupset if a stranger stared at them in the\nstreet!\nRecently, I\u2019ve learnt about the psychological experiment on \u2018Obedience to Authority\u2019\nby Professor Stanley Milgram at Yale University that began in July 1961, which I think\nis provides very good proof that humans\nbehave very differently to each other when\nthey are separated by a screen.\nThe subjects of the experiment were random people who thought that they were participating in an experiment on their memory.\nEveryone had the role of a teacher who was\nresponsible to ask a \u201clearner\u201d some questions and to give him an electric shock every time his answer was incorrect. Of course,\nthe learner was an actor who wasn\u2019t actually receiving the shocks, he was just pretending to feel the pain.\nThe results were astonishing; many of the\nexperiment participants administered a\nmassive 450-volt shock, though many were\nvery uncomfortable doing so.\nSpecifically, they were far more likely to do\nthis when they could see the learner through\nsilvered glass, but couldn\u2019t hear them than\nwhen they had to press the hand of the\n\u201clearner\u201d to the shock plate themselves.\nIt is not only obvious but also scientifically\nproven that the more the distance between\npeople increases, the less they feel the effects that their actions can have. And as\none of the main goals of technology is to increase communication between people who\nare far apart, this phenomenon happens\nmore and more nowadays to the majority of\npeople, without them even noticing it.\nDoes it work on you as well?\nAnastasia Eleftheriou\nThis week scientists made mouse organs\nyounger. Some speculated we could do\nthe same to humans.The question is...\nWOULD YOU TAKE AN ANTIAGING PILL?\nFRIDAY 03 decEMBER 2010\n\n"

    "content": "felix\nFRIDAY 03 december 2010\nTECHNOLOGY\nTechnology Editor: Samuel Gibbs\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIt\u2019s been 27 years since the first handheld portable mobile phone came out and since then\nit has revolutionised the world. With the development of GSM technology and seamless\ninternational roaming, it is now possible for\nany two people, on different corners of the\nEarth not connected by wires, to talk to each\nanother at any time simply by dialling a sequence of numbers on their phone. The mobile phone has torn down geographical and\nnational barriers and made the whole world\nfeel a lot smaller.\nGoogle have launched two apps, which aim\nto bring down not only communication, but\nlanguage barriers too. They promise to take\nDouglas Adam\u2019s \u2018Babel Fish\u2019 and Star Trek\u2019s\n\u2018Universal Translator\u2019 out of the realm of science fiction and into reality.\nThe Google Goggles application, currently\navailable for iOS & Android, allows you to\nread in a foreign language. Using your camera\nphone, you can take photos of signs or menus\nin another language \u2013 the application then uses\noptical character recognition (OCR) technology to automatically extract all the text from\nthe image and uses translation technology to\ntranslate it into English (or your preferred lan-guage). The application currently only supports\nLatin-based languages such as English, French\nand Italian, but the goal is to eventually support\nnon-Latin based languages such as Arabic and\nChinese once OCR technology has been developed further.\nThe Android-only Google Translate application allows you to say something in English\nand it\u2019ll read it back over the speakerphone in\na different language. It works the other way\ntoo \u2013 your conversation partner could say\nsomething in a different language and the app\nwill attempt to translate it and read it back to\nyou in English. This means you can have a\nconversation with anyone, even if you know\ntotally different languages. The application\nuses the voice recognition and speech synthesis technology built into Android, hence why\nit\u2019s currently unavailable on the iPhone. The\nrange of languages supported is impressive,\nwith a full 30 operational including Chinese,\nRussian and Welsh. I personally found the\nvoice recognition to be slightly off and the\ninterface to be slightly clunky, but Google\u2019s\nCEO Eric Schmidt demoed an improved\n\u201cconversation mode\u201d interface in September,\nwhich should make the application more practical to use.\nUltimately, the usefulness of translation\napplications depends on their accuracy and\nspeed. Every GCSE Spanish student who\nhas tried using an online translator for their\ncoursework knows that translators aren\u2019t per-fect. Compound that with errors introduced\nduring optical character or voice recognition,\nand the accuracy of the translations can be\npretty poor at times. Furthermore, it still takes\n10-15 seconds to perform a translation using\nGoggles or Translate, not ideal if you\u2019re trying to hold a face-to-face conversation with\nsomeone or to understand all 20 items on a\nrestaurant menu.\nGoggles and Translate give us a glimpse of a\nfuture where the mobile phone will allow people of different cultures and languages to communicate seamlessly. They show us a future\nwhere you could travel and not have to worry\nabout ordering snails rather than chicken. It\u2019ll\ntake some further advances in OCR and translation technology before it becomes practical,\nbut those days can\u2019t be far off.\nFree App of the Week\niOS - Google Mobile for iPhone\nWhile Google doesn\u2019t have just a Goggles app on the\niPhone, the Google mobile app for iOS has Goggles\nand Voice search built-in, along with other big G stuff.\nGoogle Goggles on Android brings all the picture, text\nand photo-based powers of search to green machine.\nSnap, search, get the answer. Simples.\nAndroid - Google Goggles\nGoogle to make learning\nlanguages redundant?\nKin-Hing Lo\nWhether you regard Julian Assange as a feckless self-aggrandiser or a champion of much\nneeded disclosure, few can dispute that he has\na knack for getting attention.\nThe latest release from the WikiLeaks project is a collection of communications between\nAmerican diplomats and the political heads of\na series of administrations. Much like the previously released Iraq War Logs, the ratio of signal to noise is heavily skewed towards noise.\nIn the current release we see a similar slew of\nunsurprising revelations that vary from the banal to the humorous.\nThe released communiqu\u00e9s superficially read\nas a political edition of Heat magazine: \u201cSilvio\nBerluscioni likes to party!\u201d, \u201cMedvedev is the\nRobin to Putin\u2019s Batman!\u201d, \u201cPrince Andrew is\nrude and elitist!\u201d. There is nothing surprising in\nthe reality that diplomats are only human, who\ngossip and bicker as much as any other group.\nWhile seeing usually-guarded politicians\nspeaking frankly is novel, it doesn\u2019t really educate us. The noise in these logs is a little more\nsubtle, but hints towards the profound.\nThe shift in China\u2019s stance towards North\nKorea, the Arabian perspective on Iran, and the\ncandid assessment of Israel\u2019s position in the\nMiddle East, as well as Americans spying on\nthe UN, and the fight to save Gary McKinnon\n\u2014 these topics are the signal amidst the noise,\nand could have lasting impacts long after the\nsniggers about rude royals fade away.\nWikiLeaks: Heat edition\n\u201cThe released\ncommuniqu\u00e9s\nread more\nlike a political\nedition of Heat\nmagazine\u201d\nMarcus Shepheard\n14\n\n"

This is a good\nthing in fact, since Trejo would not have been\nable to portray anything more sophisticated\nthan that. His moody, dark expression that is\nClassic Cinema\nThe Breakfast Club\nEver felt like your parents don\u2019t understand you? Do\nthey put pressure on you to achieve? Do they spoil\nyou? Beat you? Or worse, ignore you? Everything is\ntheir fault. In fact, all adults just don\u2019t understand\nkids, because \u2018when you grow up, your heart dies\u2019.\nOr so I\u2019ve learnt from watching John Hughes\u2019 80s\nclassic The Breakfast Club.\nLet me set the scene for you. Five teenagers from\ndifferent teen film tribes are forced together for an\nentire Saturday in detention. They spend it belittling\neach other, getting high, and having emotional out-pourings. Then, because there\u2019s a load of sexual\nenergy floating around and it has to go somewhere,\nthey end up pairing off and snogging in a broom cup-board. Apart from a dweeb named Brian. I don\u2019t know\nabout you, but from my experience of teenage rela-tionships, so far, so familiar.\nBut this isn\u2019t just some shit 80s movie where\ngawky adolescents sit around, complain nobody understands them and then get off with someone hideously unsuitable.\nOk, maybe that is the bulk of the storyline. So\nwhat? The whole reason I love this movie is that it\nis banal \u2013 and we\u2019ve all been there. This is the main\nessence of why John Hughes films (Ferris Bueller\u2019s\nDay Off, Pretty in Pink) live on: teenagers haven\u2019t\nchanged, and they never will.\nI know it\u2019s easy to wish those days of pimples,\nmood swings and embarrassment away, but there\nwas some good in there too. Teenagers feel things\nwith an intensity that fades later in life. When you get\nolder, your heart doesn\u2019t die, but it does harden a lit-tle. Being a teenager is shit. Sometimes, it\u2019s nice to\ntake an hour or two to look back on all of the bullying,\ninsecurities and mind-numbing pretentiousness, and\nremember that, for all your teenage failings, you were\nprobably no more of a tit than anyone else.\nThe Breakfast Club helps you remember, just for an\nhour or two, what it feels like to go from suicidal con-fessions, to flailing 80s style dancing in the average\ntime it takes a teenage guy to \u2018rock your world\u2019. And\nthat really isn\u2019t long, trust me.\nAnna Perman\nStop for a second and look at what he\u2019s wearing...\nSeriously, WTF?\nFilm Editors: Jade Hoffman\nMatt Allinson\nEd Knock\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIf you can remember back as far as 2007, you\nmay recall the film called \u201cGrindhouse,\u201d an attempt made by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin\nTarantino to make the idea of a double feature\nfilm more appealing. You may also recall that\nthere was a fake trailer made to fill the gap between the two separate films. That trailer was\n\u201cMachete\u201d and what was going to remain as a\n\u201cfake\u201d preview became so popular that now,\nin the year 2010, we finally get the full-length\nfeature film.\nDanny Trejo has dazzled the screen for years\nas charismatic, tough antiheroes or villains\nmaking him perfect as the star. \u201cMachete\u201d tells\nthe story of an ex-Federale who has vengeance\nat heart \u2013 after an operation goes awry in Mexico, a ruthless drug lord murders his family and\nleaves him to die. Being the hard man that he is,\nMachete Cortez (Trejo) survives and escapes to\nTexas, carrying out odd jobs as an illegal immigrant for much-needed cash. It\u2019s here that he\ngets an enticing offer from business man Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey); $150,000 cash for the\nassassination of a racist US Senator (Robert de\nNiro) who is up for re-election. But Machete\nfinds himself betrayed yet again and he ends\nup running from the law, from the people who\nhired him in the first place and also from Immigrations Officer Sartana Rivera (Jessica Alba).\neffortlessly sustained throughout is all the film\nrequires of him and he nails it.\nEven after the terrific opening sequence, director Robert Rodriguez never gives up trying\nto impress the audience with his endlessly imaginative action set-pieces. Yes, a lot of them\nare bonkers, but that is exactly what made \u201cSin\nCity\u201d so great. It has the exact same effect here.\nThe biggest highlight most definitely involves\nMachete pulling out a guy\u2019s intestine for the\npurpose of using it as rope. Completely nuts\nand implausible, but watching how calmly and\ncasually Trejo carries this out is pure entertain-ment. And it\u2019s not just Trejo who gets to slice\npeople up: Alba lands a feisty role that she\nsuits surprisingly well and watching her fend\nRodriguez never gives\nup trying to impress\nthe audience with\nimaginative action\n\u201c\nin\nre\nat\nat\ne-e-as\nas\na\na\nRodriguez n\nRodrigue\nup trying to\nup trying to\nthe audien\nthe audien\n\u201d\nut is all the film\nt is al\nth\nh\non\non\nDirector Robert Rodriguez, Ethan\nManiquis\nScreenwriter Robert Rodriguez, \u00c1lvaro\nRodr\u00edguez\nCast Danny Trejo, Jessica Alba, Robert\nDeNiro, Michelle Rodriguez\nMachete\nJohn Park\noff someone twice her size with her high-heel\nshoes is again ridiculous, but fun.\nMoving at a rapid pace balancing hectic action and a plot that unexpectedly deals with\nracism, immigration and politics, Rodriguez\nrelies on a killer soundtrack to comfortably\nmove events along. It\u2019s a set of compositions\nthat certainly evoke the feeling of all the humble and trashy 70s blood-gore-sex romps. The\ngritty, down-to-earth atmosphere the music\ncreates ties in nicely with Rodriguez\u2019s visual\nstyle: something he clearly has an eye for. The\nconfident choppy editing only further emphasises the film\u2019s rough and energetic tone.\nRodriguez knows how to make proper use of\nhis range of outstanding cameo stars. Steven\nSeagal, whose films have not seen the inside\nof a cinema for a while, makes a welcome return as the trash-talking, brutal antagonist. Don\nJohnson is spot-on as the power-hungry bor-der-patrolling vigilante who acts as the film\u2019s\nmain antagonist. Lindsay Lohan has a small\npart, but the drug-addicted, attention-seeking\nteen she portrays shares striking similarities\nwith the actress\u2019 personal life \u2013 so no room for\nerror there. De Niro seems to have most fun\nas the fascist Senator who has moments of humourous monologues in what must be the actor\u2019s simplest and easiest role to date.\nNothing can be easier to watch than \u201cMachete.\u201d It\u2019s the perfect grown-up, Friday night-out film that breezes through its absurdly\nentertaining action scenes with memorable performances and a somewhat thought-provoking\nplot. The underlying serious subject matter is\ndeliberately left untouched in places because\nlet\u2019s be honest, who gives a damn about politics when you have arms, legs and heads flying\nall over the place?\nIn my day student protestors were rather more friendly than they are today...\nFRIDAY 03 decEMBER 2010\n\n"

Traffic was brought\nto a standstill as thousands of sixth form and\nuniversity protesters sped through Central London in separate marches, avoiding police attempts to block\nthem for fear of being \u2018kettled\u2019 again.\nThe scheduled march from Trafalgar Square to Whitehall\nwas supposed to set off at 2pm, accompanied by a police\nescort. This was not to be, as an early departure caught\npolice off guard and with protesters rapidly approaching\nWhitehall, along the pre-arranged route, a police cordon\nwas deployed to block their path.\nFollowing last week\u2019s Westminster protest where students were \u2018kettled\u2019 for hours without access to food or\nwater, there was a general feeling of panic in the crowd.\nSeeing their route blocked, protesters spilled out into side\nstreets, forming several smaller marches in an attempt to\nevade police entrapment.\nThe crowd detoured past Hyde Park Corner, Piccadilly and\nOxford Street in what has been dubbed, \u201cProtest Monopoly\u201d. Activities were largely harmless, with protesters waving to startled members of the public as booming reggae\nswept along the city streets.\nAs time wore on, many of the previously fragmented\ngroups returned to Trafalgar Square, where several speeches were made from the plinth below Nelson\u2019s Column. With\npolice blocking every road out of the square and the snow\nfalling harder with every passing minute, the crowd slowly\ndispersed via a controlled exit onto Charing Cross Road.\nAs the evening progressed, there was violence as a small\ngroup of protestors refused to leave Trafalgar Square. Coming to the end of a day of peaceful protest, 146 arrests\nwere made and a protestor and a police officer suffered\nhead injuries and was taken to hospital.\nThe Metropolitan Police have come under fire for their lack\nof presence at the Milbank riots and later for their \u2018kettling\u2019\ntactics used on 24 November. A Judicial Review is currently\nunderway at the High Court in relation to exactly the same\ntactics that were used in the G20 climate protest. The Met\ndenied any claims that they intended to kettle protesters at\nthis week\u2019s protest and said they formed the cordon to keep\npeople away from an exposed gas line on Whitehall.\nPresident Aaron Porter this week apologised for his\n\u201cspineless dithering\u201d and ensured that all student protests\nand activism will be supported by the NUS.\nPlans for further protests are underway, with protests being held in London on Sunday 5 and on Thursday 9, the\ndate of the parliament vote on raising tuition fees . A can-dle-lit vigil is also planned, with 9000 candles (represent-ing the new maximum fee rate) being lit on the eve of the\nparliament vote.\nAfter the events of the previous three weeks, today\u2019s protest was relatively mild. Although the movement has managed to shed most of its violent elements, it is yet to be\nseen whether momentum has also been lost. Furthermore,\nthere are worries that University students\u2019 departure over\nthe Christmas period will cause the campaign to stall.\nWill the protesters achieve the goals they have been\nseeking, or will the police stamp out any further rebellion?\nOnly time can tell.\nS\n\u2018PROTEST\nMONOPOLY\u2019\nWords and photos by Miles Robertson\nFriday 03 december 2010\n\n"

Now it\u2019s also a place to\nbuy Heston Blumenthal\u2019s Christmas Pudding for Waitrose. At the time of writing this article, the going price\nwas \u00a377.00 + \u00a37.00 P+P\n. Originally selling at \u00a313.99\ninstore, you\u2019re probably wondering why the hell people\nare parting with their cash so easily for a silly little\nChristmas pud. Firstly it\u2019s not little: it feeds 10-12 peo-ple. And it\u2019s no ordinary pud either.

No you haven\u2019t misread this\nas the Fashion section. But it isn\u2019t exactly my\nregular stroll up to my next dinner location\neither. I\u2019m hunting for the highly acclaimed\nAwana, Malaysian restaurant of the year, in\nBrompton. You get a feeling that this is not\nyour average Kiasu (student friendly Malaysian in Bayswater), with 19\u201d LCD screens\ndotted around the restaurant showing the view\nat the Satay Grill, where apart from the satay,\nthe chef also prepares the roti canai and roti\ntissue which guest star in this review later.\nThe choice is vast, with a special menu paying homage to the chilli crab festival that occurs every September-December period. The\nsatay is a must. There is nothing skimpy about\nit \u2013 just big lumps of corn-fed chicken that are\nfreshly prepared at the Satay Bar and brought\nover within minutes, so no chance of food poi-soning. Best not mention those hellish words\nin conjunction with a restaurant I\u2019m trying my\nbest to portray positively... The satay comes\nwith red curry or dal curry sauce; two small\npots of pleasure.\nThe beef rendang is Awana\u2019s proud baby,\nwinner of the Malaysian Curry Fest, hosted\nby Malaysian Kitchen earlier in August. With\nit, there was also the butterfish, a much lighter\noption compared to the rendang, wrapped in\nbanana leaf and grilled with chilli ribbons and\nlemongrass sauce. The complementary coconut rice was definitely not the standard sludgy,\nalmost porridge-like coconut rice I have been\nserved before, so fear not, it\u2019s safe to order.\nBut the star of the show was definitely the roti\ntissue. For those not familiar with this type of\n\u2018tissue\u2019, it\u2019s safe to say there is no Kleenex in\nAwana\u2019s snazzy restaurant front is not an illusion, it looks as good as it tastes\nThe best (roti) tissue you\u2019ll find in London\n2 clementines\npeel of 1 lemon\npeel of 1 lime\n250g caster sugar\n6 whole cloves\n1 cinnamon stick\n3 fresh bay leaves\n1 whole nutmeg\n1 whole vanilla pod, halved\n2 star anise\n2 bottles of Chianti, or other Italian red wine\nPeel large sections of peel from your citrus fruit. Put\nthe sugar in a large saucepan over a medium heat,\nadd the peel and squeeze in the clementine juice.\nAdd the cloves, cinnamon stick, bay leaves and about\n10 to 12 gratings of nutmeg. Throw in your halved\nvanilla pod and stir in just enough red wine to cover\nthe sugar. Let this simmer until the sugar has dissolved and bring to the boil. Keep on a rolling boil\nfor about 4 to 5 minutes, or until you\u2019ve got a beautiful thick syrup. When your syrup is ready, turn the\nheat down to low and add your star anise and both\nbottles of wine. Gently heat the wine and after around\n5 minutes, when it\u2019s warm and delicious, ladle it into\nglasses and serve. You can keep this on a low heat\nfor hours and serve as and when guests arrive.\nMulled Wine\nItaly may be home to the greatest number of\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites in the world,\nhowever, as of last week the French can boast\npipping the Italians to arguably the most questionable of awards ever granted by the United\nNations\u2019 cultural organisation. The French\nmulti-course gastronomic meal has been\nnamed to the Convention of Intangible Cultural\nHeritage.\nThe central argument to securing \u2018la cuisine\nfran\u00e7aise\u2019s\u2019 new status appears to be, in the\nwords of President Sarkozy, that the French\nhave \u201cthe best gastronomy in the world, at least\nfrom our point of view.\u201d Perhaps, but Michael\nWinner is the best food critic in the world,\nfrom his point of view, and he hasn\u2019t made it to\nUNESCO status.\nThe argument that promoting French food to\nthis level will \u201cstem the rising tide of snacks,\nfast-food and TV dinners\u201d, in the words of Annick Vin of the French heritage and gastronomy mission also does not hold. In that case,\nwhy is Jamie Oliver not a cultural heritage? Or,\nGod forbid, Trinny and Susannah. If defending\nHaute cuisine merits a UNESCO badge, then\nsurely the guardians of \u2018Haute Couture\u2019 deserve one too?\nThe committee also added that one of the\nreasons behind its choice was that French gastronomy is a \u201csocial custom aimed at celebrating the most important moments in the lives of\nindividuals and groups.\u201d Not only will Italians\nbalk at this statement, knowing full well that\nthey have their own form of haute cuisine for\nspecial occasions, but so too will any undergraduate that has ever celebrated a hangover\nfrom an epic night out with a full English break-fast. If foie gras, souffl\u00e9, and stinky cheese can\nmake it to UNESCO\u2019s list, why shouldn\u2019t fried\neggs, beans, and black pudding? Wouldn\u2019t it be\nnice to see the words \u201cspotted dick\u201d on the list\nof cultural heritage items?\nThe French ambassador to UNESCO, Catherine Colonna, stated that \u201cthe French love\ngetting together to eat and drink well and enjoy good times in such a manner. It is part of\nour tradition - a quite active tradition.\u201d Do the\nhoards of French school children that descend\nupon McDonalds daily for lunch fall under this\nstatement? Or the 18-year-old lyc\u00e9ens that grab\na pre-kip kebab at the local Lebanese at 2am?\nWho is to say what food deserves cultural\nheritage status (apart from nondescript UNESCO fat cats based in Paris of course, wining\nand dining at the best restaurants)? Food is\nan art and as with all forms of art there are no\ntruths, only perspectives. Ranking sushi, curry,\nand pizza is akin to ranking Katsushika Hokusai, Anish Kapoor, and Botticelli. Haute French\ncuisine has always been a difficult, subtle, and\nextravagant affair. But sometimes, fresh, simple food is enough to entice a palate. Variety is\nthe spice of life, and a country\u2019s cooking traditions are central to its identity. Indeed, if one\ntakes tangible statistics as truths, then Tokyo\nnow boasts more Michelin stars than Paris \u2013\ndoes that make it a better city gastronomically?\nFood is more than a necessity; it is more than\na microwavable meal; it defines who we are,\nand can enhance our understanding of a culture.\nPerhaps the problem lies in the definition of the\nUNESCO award - it is granted to \u201cintangible\u201d\njewels of mankind. That only 178 practices\nhave made the grade is incredulous, especially\nconsidering that there are 193 countries in the\nworld. The whole scheme is absurdly preten-tious, vulgar and kitsch. So much so that even\nMichael Winner has no reason to howl \u201ccalm\ndown dear!\u201d\nSome like it Haute\nCharles Betts\nFrench gourmet named UN heritage\nBy Jamie Oliver\nsight, and it is perfectly edible. It uses the same\ningredients as roti canai, but the dough is spun\nout so incredibly thin that it is quite simply a\n1mm thin pancake, about 2 feet in diameter;\nalmost as big as our fish eyes gawking at the\nsheer size.\nI believe a plug is due, and I\u2019m here to tell you\nthat Awana is offering a 3-course lunch for \u00a315\nevery day of the week so no need to feel sore\nAwana 85 Sloane Avenue, Chelsea SW3 3DX.\nNearest tube: South Kensington 020 7584 8880\nDana Li\nSatbbir/Flickr\n\n"

If\nyou\u2019re looking for something different this season, you need not look any\nfurther than this Finnish film about an\nancient child-eating devil Santa, Rare\nExports: A Christmas Tale, which\nhas been slated as this year\u2019s premier\nfestive-comedy-horror.\nIt\u2019s the week before Christmas and\nyoung Pietari uncovers the truth about\nSanta Clause: far from the Coca-Cola\ninvention of red suit and bells, Santa is\nin fact a two-horned fiend, preying on\nthe young and naughty. Over the course\nof this film\u2019s bizarre events that sees a\n400-strong reindeer herd lying bloodied\nin the snow, mysterious disappearances\nof children, and American scientists excavating an ancient mountain, Rare Exports keeps you guessing. Humour and\nsuspense are handled well in this seasonal story, and you\u2019ll laugh as you\u2019re\ntreated to one Christmas clich\u00e9 after\nanother.\nSeven years ago Jalmari Helander\nmade a short internet viral about smugglers hunting Santa Claus, following up\nin 2005 with another. The success of\nthese two shorts has led to the financing\nof this fantastically inventive feature.\nComing from these roots, however, the\nfilm is predictably flawed, by just being\ntoo damn long. At 82 minutes, the runtime is unfortunately asking too much of\nthis one, albeit brilliant, idea: the characters and plot line just don\u2019t quite fill\nup the time. That\u2019s not to say that the\nfilm is dull. It packs a fair punch of jokes\nand scares, with the first half featuring\na good selection of harrowing scenes\nand touching moments. The comedy is\nof the deathly black variety with a few\none liners, building to the final, climatic\nscene involving a helicopter, a reindeer\npen and a lot of explosives. A personal\nfavourite scene is when Peitari\u2019s father\ncatches a \u2018Santa\u2019 in a home-made wolf\ntrap and proceeds to interrogate him.\nOne of the great aspects of the film\nis that it examines our ridiculous sen-sationalisation of the Christmas period.\nGingerbread, Christmas lights, presents\n\u2013 anything you can think of to do with\nthe modern consumerist Christmas is\nhighlighted in this film and ridiculed.\nIt\u2019s not an uncommon gripe about\nChristmas, but this film brings the point\nsubtlety home. Overlooking the fact that\nthe running time is slightly too ambitious we can take away some interesting\nideas from this film and have fun whilst\ndoing so. I urge you to do something a\nbit different this year and give this offbeat Finnish film a try. Even if you don\u2019t\nlike horror films, this is a great example of modern independent film-making\ndriven by rare originality.\nDirector Jalmari Helander\nScreenwriter Jalmari Helander\nCast Jorma Tommila, Onni\nTommila, Peeter Jakobi\nRare Exports: A\nChristmas Tale\nJake Lea-Wilson\nEvil and ginger - a chilling new take on Santa Clause\nThe next move for iCU Cinema\nJade Hoffman\nOverthisterm,wehavebeenfollowingthe\nrelaunch of iCU Cinema and celebrating\nits successes \u2013 from its sold-out opening\nnight with Inception to its recent screening\nof comic-book gold Scott Pilgrim vs. The\nWorld \u2013 as it brings blockbuster films back\nto the comfort of the Union.\nBut now iCU Cinema is set to announce the return of the \u2018All-Nighter\u2019\nwhich is sure to be welcomed by all diehard film fanatics wishing to test their\nendurance in an epic 12 hour blockbuster extravaganza.\nAll-Nighters run in the final week\nof term, from 6pm-6am and features\nsix films back-to-back, with the Union\nBar opening up in between intervals all\nthrough the night.

    "content": "21\nfelix FRIDAY 03 decemBER 2010\nCOMMENT\nThe opinions expressed on the Comment pages represent the views of the author only.\nT\nhose who support the government\u2019s cuts claim that\npeople haven\u2019t looked up\nor understood the proposi-tions, and that there are no\nother viable options. I find this insulting\nand naive.\nWhile student campaigners are vocal\nabout the rise in fees and scrapping of\nEMA, at the heart of these issues is that\nthe government has announced an 80%\ncut in state funding to university teaching which would see courses no longer\nbeing offered, departments close, student\nto staff ratios increase and universities\ncutting the resources required for their\ncourses. To meet the funding gap the\ncost will be shunted onto the students in\nterms of increased tuition fees.\nThe cuts to higher education are more\nlike an amputation. I feel these reforms\nare an ideological attempt to privatise\nour university education. While savings\nof public money may be a decent goal,\nand the argument that non-graduates\nshould not pay for the university education of others is fair, there is a risk that\nthe future cost to the taxpayer would be\ngreater than under the current system.\nReuben Gibbons\nWith an increasing number of students\nentering higher education the government will have to procure greater funds\nto loan out. While the proposals assume\nthat not all universities will raise their\nfees, the Higher Education Policy Institute argue that in due time most courses\nwill be charging \u00a39000. As university\nfunding decreases it makes sense for the\nestablishments to charge as much as pos-sible. While Browne suggested monetary\ndisincentives for this, the proposals do\nnot. With the proposal\u2019s inaccuracies of\nlifetime earnings for female graduates\nand introduction of real rate of interest\nit\u2019s unlikely a graduate will pay back the\nentirety of their loan. The Treasury are\ngoing to make a loss from the inevitable\nwriting off of debt after 30 years.\nOur own Union survey shows that\ncurrent students would be dissuaded\nfrom applying to Imperial if higher fees\nwere introduced, and Ipsos Mori has\nshown that increasing of fees to \u00a35000\nor above would dissuade those from the\nlowest earning background from applying to university, which flies in the face\nof the so called fairness inherent in the\nnew system. While some say student debt\nisn\u2019t like real debt, with the introduction\nof real interest rates payable on loans, it\nwill be very much like real debt that will\nlinger on a student for decades after they\ngraduate, and there is a fear of having\nthat when in the foreseeable future there\nis little guarantee of graduate jobs or that\nthese will pay as well as in the past.\nThe main benefactors of the new\nchanges, according to the Institute of\nFiscal Studies are most likely to be universities charging the highest fees, while\nstudents will suffer as well as, if universities opt for \u00a39000 fees as expected, the\ntaxpayer. This will leave a chaotic legacy\nfor future governments and students and\na higher education system incomparable\nto the one we have today.\nIn the deficit ridden time that we are in\nthere are two ways of reversing the prob-lem: lower spending or increase taxation.\nIf we increased income tax for high earn-ers, this would affect graduates who benefited from grant maintained education\nand also cause current and future graduate to enter a system where they pay back\ntheir fair share. If students are going to\nhigher education as our Union survey\nshows because of a passion of their sub-I\nn mid September, Europe began\nto howl. Guttural, deep, pained.\nOn one day, Spain joined Italy,\nFrance and Ireland in staging a\nGeneral Strike. The hot streets of\nCadiz thronged with protesters; shops\nhad doors glued or taped shut. Europe\nhad arisen to protest austerity measures\nimposed to combat massive national\ndebt (16% of GDP in Spain\u2019s case).\nTheir people faced lowered minimum\nwage, mass unemployment (peaking\nat 20%) and stark cuts in order to meet\nPrime Minister Zapatero\u2019s aggressive\nplan to reduce debt.\nIn November, students across the UK\nbegan their own revolt, staging mass\ndemonstrations against the perceived injustices of the upcoming increase in tuition fees. I did not join these crowds, nor\nwas I at home too afraid to join in. I did\nnot go, simply, because I support the rise\nin tuition fees. I fear that by not supporting these rises we doom ourselves to real\nnational pain, real crisis, real unavoidable pain that blights so much of Europe.\nIt may not be the best possible solution:\nsimply it is the best viable solution.\nThere will be many who argue that I\nhave nothing to lose by backing the fees,\nor who may assume that I could easily\nhave afforded the increased fees. On the\ncontrary, I struggle as it is: like everyone,\nLaura Huckins\nI can make a meal for under a pound and\nwould rather put on an extra jumper than\nturn on the heating. It is not churlishness\nor superiority, then, that makes me back\nthe fees. Ultimately, I back the fees for\na number of reasons, all centred on the\nfact that I believe the university system\ncurrently falls far short of what it can offer students and the country\u2019s recovery.\nA key argument against the increase\nis that \u201cstudents are the future-they are\nvital for future economic growth\u201d. Obviously, I agree with this, or I wouldn\u2019t\nbother being a student. However, I find\nit irrational to argue that we shouldn\u2019t\nface cuts in our budget when almost\nevery other sector faces wage-freezes,\nmass redundancies or unemployment.\nMy cousin is a midwife and health visi-tor. She has been unemployed for two\nyears. Several relatives working in science face regular risks of redundancy. It\nis unfair, it is hard: it is the same story\nacross the country. I cannot find an argument which can convince me that, in\nthis atmosphere, we should be exempt.\nUniversities face a funding crisis as the\ngovernment struggles to finance further\nsubsidies for ever-increasing numbers of\nstudents. In order to continue to subsi-dise poorer students and socially responsible degrees (nursing, teaching, medi-cine, etc) some funding must be found\nor the scheme abandoned. To argue then\nthat financially comfortable students\nshould not face any worsening of their\nsituation is insulting both to students\nwho rely on government help and to the\npublic at large.\nAnother popular argument is that an\nincrease in fees will deter many students\nfrom University education: I find it hard\nto believe this. On the whole, the new\nfunding system allows for greater subsidies and grants, ensuring that students\nhave in fact a greater access to learning.\nThe repayment plan should also ensure\nthat any student earning below an average of \u00a330,000 pa for 30 years after\ngraduating will never in fact pay back\ntheir entire loan. It seems hard to argue,\nthen, that students will be barred financially from entering university.\nI stated in the beginning of this article that I believe the proposals will improve the university system as a whole,\nas well as simply plugging a yawning\nfunding gap. A large amount of what is\nwrong with universities today lies in the\nchasm between what students require\nand what universities actually provide.\nIt is sadly commonplace to hear tales\nof Freshers discovering that they have\nfour \u201ccontact hours\u201d a week at their top\ntwenty university, studying what should\nbe an academically rigorous course. By\nHigher fees will rescue our universities\n\u201cEvery other sector\nfaces wage-freezes,\nmass redundancies\nor unemployment\u201d\n\u201cThese reforms\nare an ideological\nattempt to privatise\nour university\neducation\u201d\nThe coalition\u2019s plans are ideological\nject, and presumably aim for a job like-wise, it shouldn\u2019t be too unpalatable.\nI am disappointed and surprised that\nthe Union passed their opinions before\nthe results of their own survey were\npublished. Council should pass papers\nbased on the student population\u2019s views.\nDespite the low turnout for the survey\nit was clear that current students want\nto maintain the current system, disagree\nthat different institutions and courses\nshould pay different fees and would\nhave been put off applying to university if the fees were higher. Just 5.3%\nof students thought leaving university\nwith greater than \u00a330,000 of debt was\nacceptable, yet an increase to \u00a36,000\nfees would see student debt for a 3 year\ncourse at this level, with longer courses\nand higher fees being worse. I hope the\nUnion Council reconsiders its stance\nand comes out against the proposals,\nand at the very least lobbies college\nagainst \u00a39,000 fees. Never before have\nI come across so many people talking\nin lectures against an issue. It\u2019s time for\nus all to make it clear to the Union and\nCollege that we oppose the changes and\nintroduction of higher fees.\nincreasing tuition fees the covenant between student and university should be\nstrengthened, with students demanding\nmore from their courses and universities\nmore accountable to their students. This\ncan only be a good thing.\nThe plans also include increasing\nequality of payment plans for part time\nand full time students. Currently, part-time students are required to pay up front,\nwhich effectively bars access to these\ncourses, many of which combine working and studying, for a large number of\nstudents. Creating a level playing field\nhere may be an under-publicised area of\nthe government\u2019s plans but is nonetheless a laudable one and one which shows\ncommitment to providing students with\ngreater choice over their education.\nThere are many who see the protests in\nLondon as a true standard of courage, of\nbravery, of revolution against an unfair\nsystem. More daring, however, are those\nwho choose to support the fees. It will\nmean higher debt; it will mean harsher\nstandards of living. It will be worse, in\nthe short term. In the long term, we may\nhave a chance to rescue the system before it is corrupted and crippled. It may\nbe brave to stand in the snow and protest\nfor lower fees: it is braver to stand by\nthese changes and suffer slightly for the\ngreater good.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 03 december 2010 27\nARTS\n\u2018The Looking Glass Club\u2019 tells the story\nof a rather elusive Union society \u2013 a society without a stall at the Freshers\u2019 fair\nanyway; a society which convenes in\na dark and dank room somewhere underneath South Kensington, accessible\nonly through a secret tunnel with the\nmembership list kept a closely guarded\nsecret. It is the story of Zeke, an otherwise normal Physics student, that is\nuntil he was approached and befriended\nby a PhD student; in the midst of developing a, to put it lightly, mind altering\ndrug, who persuaded him to come along\nto a club meeting.\nThe book switches from Zeke\u2019s student days and the club set in the familiar background of South Kensington to\nManhattan and the present day future \u2013\nfull of scary robotic nurses, the Freedom\nTower and some truly mystifying hospital scan results.\n\u2018The Looking Glass Club\u2019 is a fast\npaced, sometimes funny, sometimes\nscary and overall thoroughly addictive\nnew book. Full of mystery and intrigue\nthe book maintains its balance on the\nthin line between being unpredictable\nI should start off by saying that I loved\nthe book \u2013 you\u2019ve converted me to Science Fiction! (See the review below)\nFantastic! You weren\u2019t a sci fi fan before\nthen?\nNo, and I was nervous about reading\nit in case I thought it was awful!\nLots of people have felt the same way\n\u2013I\u2019ve had some fantastic feedback from\npeople though \u2013 it\u2019s really lovely to hear\npeople say that they\u2019re not normally science fiction fans and yet the absolutely\nloved the book. That\u2019s something I really wanted to achieve.\nHow did you come up with the idea of\n\u2018The Looking Glass Club\u2019?\nI\u2019m not still a physicist but I do like to\nread about it, about new ideas and became so engaged in it that I actually\nthought about writing a book about\nphysics itself; then I realised that that\nprobably wasn\u2019t going to happen and it\nwould take about ten years of dedication\nand incredible mathematical rigour so I\nthought I would do the next best thing\nand make a novel instead. I had a dream\nactually \u2013 It was one of those moments\nwhere you just run out of bed and get\nright to the keyboard and start writing.\nWhat made you decide to set part of\nthe novel at Imperial?\nThat was a very conscious decision because I get a bit sick of reading novels\nset in Cambridge colleges and I just\nthought \u2018But Imperial\u2019s great!\u2019 and it\ndeserves to be on the fictional map. I\u2019m\nvery proud of Imperial \u2013 I\u2019ve spent six\nyears of my life there and I just fell in\nlove with London and Imperial the moment I arrived.\nWas it difficult to find a publisher for\na Science Fiction book?\nYup, it\u2019s an incredibly tough market because it\u2019s so niche \u2013 in fact there are only\nsix publishers for it in the UK. I think\npart of the reason for that is because\nmost of it is rubbish! I find that as a scientist it\u2019s very frustrating to read a badly\nwritten SF book with fundamental principles so badly written and sometimes\neven wrong and you just think \u2018God,\nwhy are they even bothering?\u2019\nThere\u2019s so many ideas and theories\nabout physics, philosophy and technology in the book \u2013 were you ever\ntold to \u2018dumb it down\u2019?\nYes! Absolutely! I had a meeting with\nan agent and her assistant editor and because she\u2019d been so enthusiastic about it\nI sort of expected that I\u2019d been going in\nthe right direction. Her assistant editor\ndidn\u2019t have the same views though \u2013 he\ndidn\u2019t really like the science and didn\u2019t\nlike the fact that it was so technical and\nhe basically said \u2018you can\u2019t do this, it\u2019s\nnot your job to write a book about physics or philosophy \u2013 it\u2019s your job to write\nabout guns and car chases.\u2019 At that point\nI just thought \u2018well, you\u2019re an idiot \u2013\ndon\u2019t tell me what to write!\u2019\nAny tips for budding authors?\nYes! Don\u2019t go it alone \u2013 get involved\nwith an authors group. I found a great\ngroup online which was a great form of\nsupport as it is quite a lonely endeavour,\nand writing a novel is hard!\nCome and join The Looking Glass Club\nWe meet Imperial alumnus Gruff Davies, who launched his sci-fi novel last week in Southside Halls\nBut do you want to read it?\nLouise Murphy\nPublished by Sencillo, available in\nthe Union Shop.\nLouise Murphy\n\u201csometimes funny,\nsometimes scary and\noverall thoroughly\naddictive\u201d\nand ridiculous \u2013 from the pregnant\nstranger with amnesia to the talking dog\nwith a new found religion. There is a\nfantastic mix of philosophical and physics theory and ideas interweaved with a\ntruly gripping story line, as well as some\nbizarre advances in technology. The plot\nis complicated but works \u2013 don\u2019t ask me\nhow, but Davies manages to keep a track\non two interweaving storylines, theo-ries, puzzles and characters and come\nout with a, dare I say it, brilliant Sci-Fi\nthriller. There are hints sometimes of a\nstory run amok and a well thumbed the-saurus, but these, I assure you, are only\nbrief patches in an otherwise great book\nwhich could very easily translate brilliantly to film.\nAt the end of each chapter are puzzles\ntaken from the notebook of a former\nmember of the club \u2013 puzzles which\ntook almost a year for Davies to compile and are almost unique in their form\nbut translate to the same thing \u2013 an im-age. Davies is offering a prize of up to\n\u00a31,000,000 to the clever beast that can\nsolve them all. But, if like me, a basic\nSudoku is more your cup of tea the book\nis still worth a read anyway \u2013 it is easy\nto be put off by the science and complicated ideas within the book but the book\nis accessible from several levels \u2013 with\nseveral readers commenting that they\nhave read it several times in quick succession and are still discovering new\nand exciting things about it.\nGE Global Research\nRedefining What\u2019s Possible\nGE Global Research Europe is set in the inspired environment of a university campus, hosting\ncutting-edge industrial labs that focus on creating the newest breakthroughs and long-range technologies for all of GE\u2019s markets including renewable energy, healthcare, aviation,\nand oil & gas.

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX\n8\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTuition fees: Bearable burden o\nFelix speaks to graduates about the old system, the proposed changes and how greatly the\nThe latest higher education reforms have\nnot been without significant resistance\nfrom many, with one of the key issues\nbeing the fear of significant debt following a proposed increase in tuition fees.\nCurrent graduates are no strangers to\ndebt, with many owing several thousand\npounds following their degree. Felix\nsought to discover just how dramatically\nthe current system affects graduates and\nwhether they themselves approve of\nthe impending changes or stand against\nthem.\nAll prospective and current students\nwho are citizens of a European Union\nmember state are eligible for an annual tuition fee loan which matches the\nyearly cost of their course. For the vast\nmajority of students, this figure currently stands at \u00a33,290, and rises each year\nwith inflation. Additionally available is\na maintenance loan, up to a maximum of\naround \u00a33,500 (higher for London stu-dents). Total student debt upon graduation therefore, for most students making\nmaximal use of both of the loans available over three years, will stand at at\nleast \u00a320,000.\nDaisy Cantalamessa, 23, a graduate\nfrom the University of Manchester, applied before the current system of top-up\nfees was introduced, though feels that it\nis \u201ca fair [system], although I think we\nshould be given more control over how\nmuch we pay back.\u201d\nRepayment of the debt is structured\nsuch that a certain percentage (9%) of\nearnings above a minimum threshold\n(currently \u00a315,000 in annual earnings) is\nautomatically collected from a university graduate\u2019s pay packet, similar to a tax.\nThis means that someone earning the\nUK\u2019s average graduate salary \u2013 around\n\u00a325,000 \u2013 will repay 9% of \u00a310,000 per\nyear, (\u00a3900) in debt contributions. At\nthis rate, it would take over 20 years to\npay back the full extent of the loan, not\ntaking into account interest, which does\nnot cause the amount owed to rise in real\nterms.\nThe introduction of top-up fees in\n2006 was itself not without controversy\n\u2013 not least due to the extreme closeness\nof the 2004 parliamentary vote , and the\ninvolvement of a number of Scottish\nmembers of parliament \u2013 whose constituents are unaffected by the changes\n\u2013 voting for their introduction.\nTony Blair\u2019s Labour government argued in 2004, despite their 2001 election\nmanifesto claiming that the party \u201c[had]\nno plans to introduce University top-up\nfees, and [had] legislated to prevent their\nintroduction\u201d, that the changes were\nnecessary for the country\u2019s universities\nto remain internationally competitive.\nIndeed, the Russell Group of Universities, which includes Imperial College,\nsupported their introduction. The government took the position that because\nuniversity graduates on average earn a\nsignificant (though disputed) amount\nmore over their lifetimes, it is reasonable for them to contribute to the cost of\ntheir tuition.\nTom MacDonald, 26, a graduate from\nNorthumbria University, determinedly\nbelieves the current system to be suit-able: \u201cEven though I prefer not to lose\nso much money a month, I borrowed the\nmoney in the first place and now I have\nto pay it back. I don\u2019t see the point in\nmoaning about it because it wasn\u2019t my\nmoney in the first place.\u201d\nThe current system\u2019s opponents argue\nMatt Colvin\nOlivia Ribeiro\nLouis Constant\nWorld\nAids Day\nFlashmob\nS\ntudents from Medsin Imperial congregated at Trafalgar\nSquare on Wednesday in a\nflashmob designed to raise awareness of the problem of patents restricting access to anti-retrovirial\ndrugs. They planned to jump into\nthe fountains, symbolising placing\nanti-retrovirial drugs in the \u2018patent\npool\u2019.

The students also sent a letter to Glaxosmithkline/Viiv Healthcare calling on\nthem to sign their HIV drug patents\nover to the UNITAID patent pool.\nKadhim Shubber\nMarie Chkaiban\nVince Cable says that the new proposals, which double/triple tuition fees\nbut increase the repayment threshold, are fairer than the current system\n\u201cOpponents argue\nthat because society\nas a whole benefits,\nthe general public\nshould shoulder the\nfinancial burden\u201d\nOld vs. New\nOld system\nTotal debt: Over \u00a330,000*\nRepayments: 9% of all\nearnings over \u00a315,000\nProposed system\nTotal debt: Over \u00a350,000\nRepayments: 9% of all\nearnings over \u00a321,000\nDebt expiry: 25 years\nDebt expiry: 30 years\n*Approximate figures for an Imperial student\non a four-year course.\nThat\u2019s the last time I ask students for directions...\nFriday 03 december 2010\n\n"

Flee the St John Ambulance service!\nB\nefore coming to London,\nmy friends and family\nloaded me up with good\nadvice. A common theme\nrunning through these\nkernels of sagacity was that London is\na very dangerous place \u2013 something I\nwon\u2019t even try and refute.\nWith every month that I stay and study\nhere, I can feel the years sloughing off\nmy life-expectancy. My lungs are the\ncouncil estate battleground between TB\nand tar and their respective gangs. There\nare macroscopic dangers too, such as the\nfine art of stepping into the road to attract a taxi\u2019s attention without losing a\nlimb in the process. The strange otherkin that inhabit London after midnight\nare equally dangerous. Are they drunk-fighty, drunk-chatty, drunk-flirty or\nsome horrid combination of the three?\nBut there is one danger in the Big\nSmoke that is not confined by the M25.\nThis threat can be found in all major cit-Rhys Davies\nies, indeed, wherever there are people. It\ncan appear perfectly harmless from a distance but when it strikes, it strikes hard.\nIt doesn\u2019t discriminate between young\nand old, rich and poor or any other dichotomy society sees fit to draw. I am of\ncourse referring to St John Ambulance.\nNow, you mustn\u2019t misunderstand me.\nI think the service that St John Ambulance provides is fantastic. Looking\nafter people with on-the-scene first aid\nand treatment is great, especially when\nit can take the pressure off the other\nambulance services. Thanks to their\nsterling efforts, the mortality from the\nOxford/Cambridge Boat Race has never\nbeen lower. However, I will say this. I\nthink that St John Ambulance prevent\nincidents at all these public events in\nthe same way the Bogeyman keeps five-year-olds in their beds at night.\nIt\u2019s fear, pure and simple; it\u2019s one of\nsociety\u2019s greatest stimuli. A primaeval\nfear of the dark \u2013 and its contents \u2013 led\nto the creation of, at varied different\ntimes, fire, religion and the light-switch.\nSport is no exception. I\u2019ve mentioned\nbefore how a fundamental fear of leopards drove our ancestors to running.\nWhere we once had leopards, we now\nhave St John Ambulance.\nBut unlike leopards, the phobic response to these Good Samaritans is\nintricate and well-crafted. It is the fear\nof the unknown. If you\u2019re unfortunate\nenough to be caught by St John Ambulance, what do they do to you? Ostensibly they\u2019re there to help, the rational\nmind reasons; what is the harm? Then\nthoughts drift to the gas canisters, the\nampoules of drugs, the defibrillators\nand people who have been trained to\nuse them \u2013 and would do anything to\ntry them out. And while that thought\nlingers and malingers in your head, you\nwonder why, of all the patients you\u2019ve\nseen go into those ambulances, you\u2019ve\nnever seen any come out again. There is\nDear Sirs, In the Name of God, the\nMost Merciful, the Most Kind.\nJustice Week intended to highlight\nvarious injustices from around the world\nand offer Islam as a potential solution to\nthese. Various powers were implicated\nin injustice during this week including\nseveral Arab nations \u2013 particularly for\ntheir complicity in torture at Guantanamo. UNICEF were invited to speak\nat our event on exploitation of the third\nworld. In addition, an American speaker\nwas invited to give his views on the invasion of Gaza in 2009. Justice Week\nwas inclusive, balanced and united students together against injustice.\nThe Jerusalem Post chose to sidestep the issues raised by Justice Week.\nInstead of contacting us, they chose\nto refer to sensationalist right wing\npropagandists posing as mainstream\nthinktanks for their views. On the other\nhand; we acknowledge Mr Scally\u2019s non-discriminatory account and thorough\ninvestigation of affairs in the Felix last\nweek.\nThe Editorial suggests we misrepresented the views of the Muslim population at our College during Justice Week.\nWe would like to point out that amongst\nthe 560 people attending the final event\nof Justice Week, over 100 tickets were\npurchased by Islamic Society members\nand there were many more Muslim\nand non-Muslim students amongst the\ncrowd. We\u2019ve received support for Justice Week from our members, Muslim\nand non-Muslim students, the Union\nand the College. Justice Week has been\na great success for Muslims at College;\nwho have found wider support for their\nopinions on injustice and will continue\nto share these in the future.\nMany Thanks,\nUmer Hakeem\nPresident of Islamic Society\nLetters\nJustice Week\nwas inclusive\nand balanced\nNorman\nFinkelstein\nmisled his\naudience\nequivalent to a lecturer (he was denied\ntenure in the US), and he has a track\nrecord of controversy among academic\ncolleagues.\nBeing at his lecture reminded me of\nthe movies by Michael Moore which\nsupposedly reveal hidden conspiracies\nbehind any action or event. But if the\nmovies by Moore are usually taken with\na pinch of salt, I was surprised to see a\nlack of critical reflection on behalf of\nthe people in the audience who failed\nto challenge any of Finkelstein\u2019s views.\nWorse than that, the inaccuracies of\nsome of the facts presented went mostly\nunnoticed because of the crowd\u2019s almost\nna\u00efve willingness to believe.\nMost of the focus of the talk was on the\noperation \u201cCast Lead\u201d, a 3-week armed\nconflict in the Gaza strip during winter\n2008-2009. Israel started the operation\nafter an escalation of rockets fired into\nits territory by Hamas militants. Hamas\nis the largest Palestinian militant Islamist organisation widely recognised as a\nterrorist organisation, which took over\ncontrol of Gaza in 2006.\nFrom the beginning Finkelstein brilliantly downplayed the necessity of the\nIsraeli action, and made the situation\ninto an almost one-sided-conflict portraying Israel as an unprovoked aggres-sor. His rhetoric reminded me of that of\na politician who highlights those aspects\nwhich favour his statements, while ignoring others that don\u2019t support his case.\nFor example, he \u201cforgot\u201d to mention the\nreasons why the Israeli government decided to go into the complicated operation in the first place. Restoration of security for Israel was absolutely essential\nafter more than 3000 rockets were fired\ninto Israel during 2008 alone. He forgot\nto mention the reasons for the blockade,\nimplemented to restrict the influence\nand power of Hamas and to stop them\nfrom smuggling weapons, consequently\nused to attack Israel. He did, however,\nmention the humanitarian crisis and purported starvation in Gaza, while forgetting to mention that Hamas had no shortage of the rockets or ammunition before\nand during the fighting.\nAs is commonplace in talks regarding\nthis topic, Finkelstein used emotional\nmetaphors to engage the audience rather\nthan offer rational arguments to defend\nhis cause. However, what made me most\nanxious was the fact that he praised Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Lebanese paramilitary group and political\nparty, Hezbollah. This group calls for\nthe imminent destruction of Israel and\nis regarded by the international community as a terrorist organisation. To much\namusement from the crowd, he glorified\nthe leadership of Nasrallah while jokingly suggesting the illiteracy of King Hussein of Jordan and of Hosni Mubarak\n(President of Egypt) with whom Israel\nhas peace agreements. This, for an Israeli in the midst of an apparently tolerant\nUK university was very disturbing and\nsimply unacceptable.\nSadly, Finkelstein also abused his\nprivilege of lecturing to Imperial students by using a rhetoric which did\nnot fall short of calling for resistance.\nBy using phrases like \u201cIsrael understands only one language \u2013 language of\nforce\u201d, \u201cIsrael wanted a bloody conflict\n...\u201d, \u201cbefore they (Israel) go for the kill\n...\u201d, \u201cIsrael would attack in the next\n12-18 months ...\u201d he actually looked to\nescalate hatred. Finally, by saying \u201cwe\nhave to get prepared for their exercise\nin insanity\u201d, \u201cwe have to act\u201d, \u201cthings\nwill not change\u201d, he seemed to encourage a call for action! This is hardly\nsomething that can provide a constructive force or harmony which can help\nbolster any peace process in the Middle\nEast.\nThe Middle East is at a very important\ncross road. The journey to peace is hard\nand at times can be unpleasant. It is clear\nthat both sides, Israel and the Palestinians, have made and will continue to\nmake mistakes. In this context, a radical\nspeaker can only hinder the journey, and\nshould be left at home. We all need leaders and speakers who can see beyond\nspecific events of a conflict, who can inspire an audience with peace initiatives\nand proposals, and pave the way for a\ntime when harmony will be achieved.\nWith God\u2019s Help = Beezrat Ha Shem =\nInshallah!\nSincerely,\nK.Gena\nThe author K.Gena wished to remain\nanonymous due to teaching responsibili-ties. His contact details can be supplied\nupon request.\nthe fear of the unknown, with the caveat\nof some pretty good guesses.\nBut there is also a fear of the inevita-ble. On the savannah plains, every time\na leopard took down a weak or injured\ngazelle, it was a memento mori to the\nherd that they too were mortal. So too\ndo St John Ambulance toll the bells of\nour doom \u2013 with crowd-parting klaxons\nand flashing lights. Avoiding St John\nAmbulance at all costs avoids too the\ngrim spectre of Death.\nBut for all this, St John Ambulance\ncontributes a valued service to society.\nIt\u2019s not a necessary evil \u2013 the work they\ndo is probably good... if their patients\nsurvive. No, instead they are the terrifying good. You know they\u2019ll be there for\nyou if you need them but you fervently\npray that day will never come. Throughout this letter, I have been comparing\nthem to leopards but now I realise this\nisn\u2019t quite right. They\u2019re more like vultures with high-vis jackets.\nDear Sirs, What can be done with a controversial radical, who also happens to\nbe a charismatic speaker?\nI am speaking of course about Norman Finkelstein, a speaker invited by\nthe Islamic Society to Justice Week.\nHe was introduced as a professor, although his academic rank would be\n\u201cEvery other sector\nfaces wage-freezes,\nmass redundancies\nor unemployment\u201d\nFRIDAY 03 decemBER 2010\n\n"

Neither issues has been resolved\nto date (8 weeks later)\u201d. Among other\nproblems Hopkins felt the lack of urgency was disappointing since the Imperial\u2019s Disability Equality Scheme states\nthat all \u201crefurbishments have considered\naccessibility as a major priority\u201d. With\nall this in hand Hopkins decided to step\ndown.\nIn response to Hopkins\u2019 resignation,\nDeputy President (Welfare) Charlotte\nIvison said she was \u201cvery sorry to see\nNicola leave\u201d but said that some of the\nissues raised by Hopkins are being re-solved. The lifts in the Union Building\nwill be \u201cfixed as soon as possible\u201d and\nthere are plans to have push button doors\nto each of the bars. However the issue\nof a drop bar (a lowered bar to allow\nwheelchair users to be directly served at\nthe bar) was considered unfeasible \u201cin\nterms of cost and inconvenience when\nconsidering the number of students it\nwill benefit.\u201d Although the Union did\nsay, \u201cTo minimise the problem caused by\nnot having a drop bar, all the bars have\nstaff on hand to offer an assisted service\nto any students who may need it.\u201d\nNicola Hopkins responded positively\nsaying, \u201cI am pleased to hear that the\nUnion has taken on board my suggestions and look forward to seeing them\nput in place soon.\u201d\nIf you feel the Union or College could\ndo more or have any suggestions for im-provements, email dpwelfare@imperial.\nac.uk for the Union and disabilities@\nimperial.ac.uk for College.\npeople were reluctant to talk to me until\nI explained that I was from a student\nnewspaper. Offers from media organizations for coverage of active protests\nare considered cautiously, after the\ncoverage of the NUS protest march.\nIn general the protestors understand\nthe importance of a good public im-age. I asked a student whether he felt\nany resentment toward the media; he\nshrugged and said that while the media\ncoverage was skewed, he believed that\nthe publicity generated by the controversial pictures really helped bring the\nissues into the spotlight.\nLooking around the room, it is clear\nthat the initial response has been good.\nBut what about in two, three, or even\nfour weeks time? Are there any plans\nto stop protesting? Talking to several\nstudents, they seemed resolute to keep\nprotesting until the issues which they are\nconcerned about are addressed. One student grimly stated that she is prepared to\n\u201cgo down fighting\u201d.\nTo see this level of commitment, passion and enthusiasm from a generation\noften labelled as disinterested and fickle\nis truly awe inspiring. Even if you do not\nagree with the reasons for the protests,\neven if you do not agree with the protest\nmethods; the unity and solidarity shown\nby these \u2018New Student Protestors\u2019 is\nsomething which you can not help but\nadmire.\nre revealed after somebody asks, \u201cWho wants a job in the city?\u201d\nPriyantha Kulatilake\nFriday 03 december 2010\nOrganising the protests\nI\nn response to the government\u2019s proposal to increase\nthe tuition fee cap and cuts to\nhigher education, protest groups\nhave been \u2018popping up\u2019 all across\nthe country. Each of these protest groups are independent of\neach other, which means the actual methods of protesting and\nkey decisions are made by the\nindividuals within the group.\nWho joins these groups?\nThere is no \u2018stereotypical\u2019 pro-tester; members of these groups\nare as diverse as the student\npopulation they represent\u2013\nstretching across a range of\nages, different ethnicities and\nbackgrounds.\nHow do they protest?\nThe main methods of protesting\nused by these groups are occupation and demonstrations. An\noccupation is where activists\n\u2018take over\u2019 a room and refuse\nto leave of their own accord until their demands are met. They\noften use the room as a base of\noperations. A demonstration is\na street protest, where activists\nmarch en masse to a designated\nendpoint. An example would be\nthe NUS marches on the 10th of\nNovember.\nHow do mass protests occur?\nAlthough these protest groups\nare independent of each other,\nmany of them keep in contact\nusing social media such as Facebook and twitter.\nThis means that groups all\naround the country can collaborate for mass protests-such as\nthe student protests earlier this\nweek. Groups mainly use the social networks to contact each\nother, sharing opinions, giving\nadvice, updating each other on\nprogress and sharing messages\nof support. These sites are also a\nmeans for students who are not\npart of the group to show support or complain about the activities of the group.\n\n"
