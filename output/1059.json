    "content": "TWO FELIX FRIDAY MAY 31ST1996 NEWS\nSilence in the library?\nBY RACHEL WALTERS\nAs substantial excavation work\ncontinues outside the Lyon\nPlayfair Library, IC's SubLibrarian Richard Halls has said\nhe is 'monitoring the situation\nclosely'. He insisted that the\ncontractors Schal International\nwere doing everything possible to\nminimise disturbance to students\nduring their exams, and that\nthere had been no official\ncomplaints. The 'noise is quite\nlocalised', he said. The workmen\nhave been doing all the 'heavy\nnoise work' between 8 and\n9.30am, before the library opens.\nMr Hall said that the noise\nwas largely unavoidable if the\nplans, which will include a concert hall, a humanities centre\nand a new bookstore in a building\nwith two new floors are to go\nahead. \"We haven't hit any\nsnags,\" he said, explaining that\nthe 'really noisy part' won't begin\nuntil July I st, when a crane will\nbe installed on the roof. He said\nthat library staff are 'planning\nlike mad' to arrange for parts of\nIP\nj HH|&& jj hi.*4t tm the collection to be relocated\nwhile building gets underway.\nHe admitted that there\nwould be some disruption to\nlibrary services over the summer,\nbut said that staff were planning\nto increase students' book loan\nPHOTO: IVAN CHAN\nallowances so they could take\ntheir books to study elsewhere if\nthe noise disturbance became to\ngreat. A new temporary entrance\nwill be located in the Sherfield\nbuilding by the Great Hall while\nwork on the new lobby proceeds.\nNews in brief\ncontinued from page one\npositions available would be\nunsuitable lor casual student\nstaff because of the skills and\nhours required, the College have\na continuing need for part-time\ncleaning and waite ring staff.\nMatt insisted that the plans\nwould have provided an \"excel-lent service for students who\nneed money, giving them reliable places to work and good\nemployers.\" He said that setting\nup a specifically student-orientated age ney would help to\nrelieve the problem of hard-up\nstudents being abused by\nunscrupulous employers.\nInsisting that College\nauthorities \"are trying to be\nsympathetic and constructive,\"\nMike Hansen said \"we're not\ngoing to say you can't and we're\nnot going to say you mustn't\". He said the idea was 'intuitively\nattractive' and said the College\nwould be willing to pay a fee for\nthe service of a system which\ncould help provide casual staff\nonce it was set up.\nHe suggested that ICU might use some of their profits\nfrom their trading outlets,\nincluding the college bookshop,\nto finance the venture. But\nUnion staff say they no longer\nfeel confident of the bookstore\nrevenue. Rental of the new\nenlarged shop is expected to go\nout to tender this summer, and\nit is possible that ICU will lose\nthe outlet to a large chain, such\nas Dillons or Blackwells. \"The\njob shop is exactly the sort of\ninitiative that will suffer if we\ndon't have the bookstore,\" Matt\nCrompton insisted.\nRevenue from the bookstore accumulated over recent\nyears will be spent this summer\non refurbishments to ICU's Beit\nQuad premises. A \u00a3100,000\nrefit of the Entertainments\nLounge, as well as a possible new\nclubs and societies room has\nbeen planned. Matt defended\nthe spending: \"When a student\ngoes round on open days, they\nlook at the university's social\nfacilities, and we need to\nimprove them... If we lose some\nof our trading we will lose some\nof our ability to upgrade the\nfacilities.\"\nno jobs for the boys\nA poll of over 10,000 of the UK's best finalists showed that only\n27% expected to start work on\ncompleting their course. Nearly a quarter planned to continue\nstudying, although approximately\none in ten had no fixed plans at\nall.\nInformation from Britain's top 24 universities cites the BBC\nand British Airways as being grad-u at es' most favoured employers.\nBut there are indications that\ntoday's students are more entrepreneurial then ever before, as\nthe category of 'self-employed'\nranked third in the ratings. Other\nchoices named when students\nwere asked, \"If you could work\nfor any organisation of your\nchoice, what would it be?\"\nincluded Baywatch, The Mafia,\nThe Sultan of Brunei, Playboy,\nAnn Summers and World of\nLeather.\nLSE uneconomical\nThe London School of\nEconomics is set to have a budget\ndeficit of \u00a32.5 million this year.\nGovernors are said to be 'very\nworried,' fearing that the disastrous showing will have serious\nimplications for the institutions\nlong-term competitiveness and\nstanding.\nKate Hampton, LSE Students' Union President, has\nsaid that she is concerned that\nthe deficit will lend weight to the\nargument that students should be\ncharged top-up fees.\nAUT doesn't want\ngrants either\nA week after the Labour Party\nannounced its plans to replace\nstudent grants with a long-term\nloans system, the Association of\nUniversity Teachers has also\nabandoned its long-standing\nsupport for a return to state-funded grants for all students.\nDelegates at last week's annual\nconference voted to press all\npolitical parties to address under-funding, insisting that the current\nDearing inquiry should not use\npresent funding levels as a starting point for its review.\nUK research last\nThe UK has shown the lowest\ngrowth in expenditure on\nresearch of all the Group of\nSeven leading industrial nations\nover the past ten years.\nThe UK' s gross domestic\nexpenditure on science, technology and engineering was \u00a314.6\nbillion, giving it an 'average'\nrating in comparison to its\ncompetitors. But the funding\nlevels have not been increasing as\nmuch as other countries.\nExpenditure here increased by\n18%, compared with 45% in\nGermany, and 93% in Japan.\n\n"

He takes it upon himself to groom\nAtwater into network material and predictably\nthey fall in love. Then she moves to Philadelphia\nto become an anchorwoman and begins to flo un der, until Justice quits his job to join her.\nThis is hardly the most original of plots and\nthe only redeeming aspects of the film are the\nperformances from Pfeiffer and Redford.\nSomehow, despite the script, they manage to\nmaintain their dignity and there is even some\nchemistry between them. The supporting cast\naren't given enough screen time to be more than\ninstant iy forgettable and it is only Stockard\nChanning's super-bitch anchor who leaves any\nlasting impression.\nUp Close... is a typical Hollywood studio\nmovie, which relies on the pulling power of its\nstars rather than the quality of the script. This is\na nice, safe, feel-good movie; the person upon\nwhom the Atwater character was based actually\nlost her network spot due to a cocaine overdose\nand died at 35. Such socially unacceptable character development would appear to be un suit able, even if it would have made a better film.\nfilm: secrets and lies.i dals I am unwilling to give away too much of the plot:\nsuffice to say that this film centres around two\nsiblings; Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn), a dowdy single mother with a grown-up daughter and a factory job, and Maurice (Timothy Spall), a successful portrait photographer with a wife and a big house, but no children. The film spans the a month or so before a barbecue held to celebrate\nCynthia's daughter Roxanne's twenty-first birth-day, and the rising tensions are triggered by\nHortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), a young\nwoman who becomes friendly with Cynthia.\nThe acting in this film is excellent, and\nBrenda Blethyn is especially good, but to single\nher out would be unfair. This film really works\nbecause you do not see any actors at all, only\npeople you walk past on the street every day.\nThe main difference between this film and\nNaked, Mike Leigh's last film, is that Secrets and\nLies is not as down-beat. The characters are not\nso tired of the world, and although their lives are\noften painful, they remain optimistic. like\nNaked, there is also plenty of humour to lighten\nthe load, and the background musical ditty is\nupbeat, saying \"there is something about to hap-pen, life isn't dull!\"\nMy only warning about this film is its length;\nat 140 minutes long, be prepared for it to eat up\nyour evening.

    "content": "simon baker\nEngland expects every\nman to do his duty... and\neat his beef.' So The Sun\ngreeted the news that John\nMajor had 'declared war'\non Europe after over two\nmonths of almost total\ninaction. Douglas Hogg, as\nAgriculture Minister, has\nproved completely ineffectual in dealing with\nthe problem, probably meriting dismissal, and\nheralding the response of the Prime Minister.\nIt is undoubtedly the case that the \u2022noncooperation policy was in part to fend off the\nprospect of cabinet resignations among the\nEurosceptic ranks, but the adverse press reaction\nin the last few days is unjustified. Here we have\na situation where Britain has given considerable\nground over recent times on the promise of a relaxation of the export ban on derivative prod-uc ts, only to be rebuffed on every occasion. In\nthe light of this, the frustration of John Major is\ncompletely understandable, but to view his\nactions as those of a desperate man is wholly\nmisguided. The options open to Britain to deal\nwith the intolerable intransigence of the other\nmember states are so limited that the blanket\nscuppering of unanimous voting was almost the\nonly legal option open to Britain.\nMany will call this a petty example of the\nmalice of Little Englanders, of xenophobia and\nmisguided nationalism, when in fact all that is\nbeing attempted is the defence of our national\ninterest. It is all very well to criticise the actions\nof Britain, but one must look at the incessant\nprocrastination of the EU. One positive benefit\nto come out of this unfortunate situation is a close examination of Britain's position in the EU and vice versa.\nIt is very unfortunate that the debate on\nEurope in Britain has become polarised between\nthose who believe in withdrawal and those who\nbelieve in an inexorable move towards a federal\nEurope. Both are, of course, patently ridiculous\nstandpoints. The benefits of membership are\nclear to see, in the central areas of free trade and\nfreedom of movement. This is where Europe\nworks well. The Single Market has functioned\npretty well and should represent the last radical\nchange in the EU. We should now be embarking\non a process of evolution to refine the system,\ntackling weaknesses such as the ludicrous\nCommon Agricultural Policy.\nThe problem is that much of the rest of\nEurope, led by Germany, seems hell-bent on\nfederalism and monetary union. Already we\nhave a situation where the sovereignty ofthe UK government is being regularly undermined by\nthe European Court and directives are being\npassed on the most trivial aspects of life. We are\nseen as bad Europeans for dissenting from the\ncurrent goals of the EU, but it must be remembered that most of these policies did not exist in\nany shape or form at the time of our joining, nor\nwas federalism identified as a future aim. Given\nthat we appear to have been\nsold a dummy, I think we\nare more than justified in\nbeing a little peeved.\nAs I'm sure you\nwill appreciate, dear reader,\nI am not a man who likes to\nsay 'I told you so' (and if you\nbelieve that...) However,\nwhile poring over old copies\nof Felix, I noticed in issue 1040 that I expressed\nmy doubts about your friend and mine Ghassan\nKarrian, erstwhile ULU president. I said that 'we\nare mere pawns in the Karrian game plan\ndesigned to propel him into Westminster.' And\nwhat do you know, as soon as the NUS have\nbeen kicked into line, paving the way for\nLabour's new loans scheme (I think that's Utum no. 245), our man does a runner to reemerge as Senior Campaigns Coordinator for\nWest London, baby-kisser-fn-chief.\nTo call his actions cynical doesn't even come\nclose to describing the despicable way in which\nhe has behaved of late. Arguably his absence will\nhelp ULU immeasurably, since he doesn't seem\nto have done much for London's students this\nyear and we can only wait for Sarah White to\npick up the pieces left by him. The tiling to do\nnow is to get him removed from the post, by a vote of no confidence or any other trick in the\nconstitutional rulebook, so that he realises that\nwe are not prepared to tolerate his behaviour. As\nfor becoming a Labour spin doctor, he has all the\nright qualities: arrogance, the ability to sacrifice\nanyone or anything for the cause, deception and\nthe skill of speaking in such vague terms that it is\nbarely possible to discern his subject, let alone\nviewpoint. Ghassan Karrian makes Peter\nMandelson look positively wholesome, which is\nprobably the most vitriolic attack one can make\non a Labour supporter.\nHaving dwelt on Europe somewhat this\nweek, there is not much space for news in\nCollege, which is just as well since nothing has\nhappened. I could talk about the Rag fe te, but I can hardly bring myself to intrude on private\ngrief. As I said to one of the Raggies rec end y, when asked why I hadn't mentioned them for\nmonths, I don't like to kick a man when he's down. That said, I could not help laughing at the\nnews that only six people pitched up, most of\nthem Rag hacks. I know the weather was awful,\nprompting the relocation, but this does suggest\nthat the interest in the event was on a par with a Socialist Worker rally in Belgravia. OK, I lied\nabout the grief intrusion bit.\nFinally, more disturbing conversations in\nSouthside Bar. I, and earlier one of the bar staff,\nhad an animated discussion with one of the pun-ter s, who passionately believed that the beer in\nthe Union was better than in Southside. As I realised my chances of making him see sense\nwere on a par with the likelihood of converting\nthe Pope to Protestantism, we had to agree to\ndisagree.\n\n"

In Rachel's editorial last\nweek, I am quoted as saying that\nit would take major civil unrest\nfor college to listen to student\nopinion. This is not true. I intended to say that student representation on the college examining committees is unlikely.\nStudent opinion is considered,\nno, requested by all hoard of\nstudies committees. These committees concern themselves with\nthe quality of all academic courses at Imperial. The students who\nare asked about student opinion\nare the ICU president, CCU academic affairs officers and the\nfCU graduate affairs officer.\nOften these people are unable to\nconsult a wider range of opinions\nbefore representing the student\npopulace, but they try. Basically,\nstudent opinion is consulted on\nmost academic matters.\nI am sure that student opinion is also requested in many\nother areas. The only glaring\nomissions as far as I can see is the\nlack of student presence on the\nexamining committees and the\ncollege management planning\ngroup. It is not unreasonable that\nstudents are not on examining\ncommittees, as these committees\noften discuss individual students,\nf felt that the calculator issue\nshould have been discussed on\nthe undergraduate studies committee which has five student\nmembers. Perhaps a student\npresence on the management\nplanning group would reduce student concerns that the college's need to raise revenue may detract\nfrom the needs of the students.\nBut I fear that students are\nunlikely to be invited to join this\ngroup.\nYours,\nMatt Szyndel\nRCSUAAO\nposte red Dear Felix,\nObviously, IQ posters are in high\ndemand with the trend conscious\nIC students.

Yes, the\nRegistry did ask for references.\nDepartments usually require\nthese because individual students\napplying from inside the College\nmay not be known to selectors\nfor a particular course.\nFurthermore all applicants are in\ncompetition for places and need\nto be considered equally by se lec tors. Yes, I agree it does seem\ndaft that internal applicants are\nasked to provide details of 'A' level results we already know.\nThe problem is a practical one of\ncapturing the information on the\nform without having to have even\nmore people in the Admissions\nOffice inserting it so that we'd need a room the size of Wembley\nStadium instead of the Wembley\nArena1\n. We are, however,\nredesigning the form at the\nmoment so we will see what can\nbe achieved.\nYours sincerely,\nFV McClure\nAcademic Registrar\nPS Nigel Wheatley is not yet the\nRegistrar but, on the strength of\nSimon's article, he's put in for a pay rise!\nbeads ringing\nDear Felix,\nSimon Baker writes: \"Cambridge\ndo have the upper hand in one\nrespect.

Union staff had planned to\nset up an employment agency as a service for hard-up students, but\nclaim their plans have been\nthwarted by an un supportive Finance department.\nThe scheme would have kept\na database of student skills and\navail abilities which would then\nbe matched with part-time\nvacancies in college as the need\narose. ICU had been hoping for\nfunds to support a full-time\nmember of staff for two years to\nimplement the programme, after\nwhich the system would be reap-praised.\nMike Hansen, IC Director of\nfinance, insisted that he had\ngiven the scheme \"a huge amount\nof support\" even though \"we\nhaven't given them any money,\nbecause that's not the way we do\nit.\" Imperial College Union\nreceives its funding in a lump-sum sub vent ion, and College puts\nno constraints on how it is allocated. Mr Hansen said that if the\nUnion felt that establishing a job-shop was an important student\nservice, then they \"should sacrifice something else to fund it.\"\nDefending the College's stance,\nhe exclaimed, \"Just saying, 'Oi,\nGuv, give us an extra \u00a317,000'\njust isn't the way we do it, regret-t ably.\" He also raised questions\nover the welfare implications of\nCollege actively encouraging\nstudents to work whilst studying\nfull-time.\nMatthew Crompton, ICU\nDeputy President (Finance and\nServices] insisted that the proposition would have saved IC\nmoney in the long run.

    "content": "FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY 31 ST MAY 1 9 9 6 . THREE\nGOTTA BE CRUEL TO BE KIND?\nNAT BARB DISCUSSES THE ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST ANIMAL RESEARCH\nHow sick can you get? A skin supplement\nmarketed as \"cruelty free\" to animals was in fact\nmade from a serum derived from the blood of\nlaboratory rabbits. The serum was made by\ninjecting piglet skin into rabbits and then bleeding them. But hey, don't worry - the cream\nwasn't tested on animals, so it's cruelty free.\nNow my conscience is clear: the cream's not\ntested on animals - it's made from them!\nHere's another story.\nMy cousin should be dead - she has diabetes.\nIf she didn't inject herself daily with insulin she\nwould have died before I was born. Hooray for\nthe wonder drug insulin! But hold on, what is\ninsulin? Well, until recently it was basically\nextract of pancreas, but now it can be manufactured. Some of the decisive research work\ninvolved scientists injecting crude extract\nof pancreas into fasted rabbits.\nI am very glad that my cousin is alive\nand well and that my aunt and uncle were\nspared the tragedy of losing a child for\nreasons beyond their control. Thanks to\nall the rabbits, dogs and other animals that\nsuffered and died in the search for a cure\nfor diabetes, thousands of families have\nbeen spared a great deal of agony.\nIf, like me, you've been looking at the\nposters on the escalators on the underground you may have noticed a new\nposter campaign launched by an organisation called RDS. It aims to redeem the\nimage of scientists involved in vivisection\nand to educate the public about animal\nexperiments. This campaign counters the\nactivities of anti-vivisection organisations\nsuch as the National Anti-Vivisection\nSociety who had their lab animal week\nlast month, and the British Union for the\nAbolition of Vivisection. But what do\nthese people really have to say about the\nrights and wrongs of vivisection?\nIs vivisection defensible and if so under\nwhat circumstances? So far it seems reasonably simple - you have two similarly unpleasant experiments on animals but for extremely\ndifferent functions. Animal tests are okay if they\nare intended to save lives, but they're despicable\nif their sole aim is our beautification.\nOf course, nothing is simple in the case of\nanimal experiments. When you look deeper into\nthe matter, particularly that of medical research,\nother questions begin to appear. Is it truly essential to carry out animal experiments? Is it the\nonly effective method of research? Is it an effective method of research at all- can you really\ncross the species barrier?\nThe anti-vivisection movement thinks that\nthere are other equally effective methods for\nmedical research which do not require animal\ntesting. Some would even say that animal tests\nare ineffective. The NAVS (National AntiVivisection Society) lists a whole range of\ninstances where the effect of a drug on an animal\nis completely different from the effect of that\ndrug on a human, it therefore posits the argument that animal experiments can be detrimental to progress in medical research.\nThe British Union for the Abolition of\nVivisection told me that they just want to move\ninto the 21 st century: \"we have the technology\n- there are alternatives\". If this is the case, then\nwhy do we continue with animal experiments?\nOne reason is past successes. Many eminent\nscientists quote past achievements using animal\nresearch as a basis for justifying animal experiments. Dr Joseph Murray, the 1990 Nobel Prize\nwinner for pioneering work on transplant rejections has said: \"There would not be a single\nperson alive today as result of an organ or bone\nmarrow transplant without animal experiment a PH WEI G INSL\n\u2022 TD B RAP HE D IN 1 9 2 2 , THIS DIABETIC GIRL HE D JUST45 LB BEFORE BEING TREATED WITH J LIN.A FEW MONTHS LATER SHE HAD MADE A DRAMATIC RECOVERY. tion. All the work that we did depended on the\nuse of animals\".\nThose who carry out animal experiments for\nmedical research feel they are absolutely essen-ti al. RDS, an organisation whose aim is \"to\ninform the general public about why animals are\nused in medical research\" says that non-animal\nmethods are very widely used but the two\nmethods complement each other. What is\nmore, only 5 % of research costs go towards\nanimal studies. The British Medical Association\nhas said that, \"animal experimentation is necessary at present to develop a better understanding of diseases and how to treat them, but\nbelieves that, when possible, alternative methods should be used\".\nBut what does this mean: \"when possible,\nalternative methods should be used\"? How is\nthis put into practice? Britain has some of the\nmost stringent regulations in the world for safeguarding laboratory animal welfare and for\nawarding licenses for animal research. Licenses\nare only granted provided certain conditions are\nmet: if the potential results are important\nenough to justify the use of animals, the research\ncannot be done using non-animal methods, the\nminimum number of animals will be used and\ndogs, cats and primates are only used when\nabsolutely necessary. These regulations are\nenforced by the Home Office who employs a team of inspectors, all qualified vets or doctors,\nwho visit each research establishment eight\ntimes a year usually without prior notice.\nAll this seems eminently reasonable, but how\ncan you measure these things? How far do you\nlook into non-animal methods before you agree\nthat there are no suitable ones? Both sides have\nvery convincing arguments. Those who\nare for vivisection will say that they do\nseriously consider suitable alternatives. Those who are against will tell you\nthat they don't: animals are cheap and\nso is the comparative cost of animal\nexperiments.Those who are for animal\nexperiments genuinely feel they are\nessential to progress in research, those\nwho are against feel they are not.\nTo back up their arguments both\ngroups will cite different case histories\nbased upon very different premises and\nit is easy to become swallowed up in an\nunproductive \"what if\" discussion.\nHistorical fact shows us that we have\ncures for illnesses as a result of animal\nexperiments. Whether we would have\nthese cures without animal experiments is mere speculation. Here at\nImperial, Professor Collinge has been\nworking with transgenic mice to establish if there is a link between BSE and\nCJD. He himself has admitted that\nthere is a long way to go with the\nresearch and that altering just one gene\non a mouse does not make it human, so\nwhat will the experiments with mice achieve?\nI 've not really touched on the other a rgu ment; do we have the right to experiment on\nanimals? Can you attach a value to different\nspecies' lives and decide that one is worth more\nthan another? There are almost certainly some\nvery wrong things about some of animal experiments that go on around the world today. But\nwhether they are as a whole completely unethical and unnecessary is something we have to\ndecide for ourselves once we have waded\nthrough the maze of opinions offered by both\nsides of the argument.\nFor more information from the organisations\ninvolved contact:\nRDS,58 Great Marlborough Street, London\nWIV IDD\nThe British Union for the Abolition of\nVivisection, 16a Crane Grove, London N7\n\n"

    "content": "The relationship\nbetween\na balanced diet and\ngood physical health\nis well known.\nHowever, the latest\nresearch points to a similar link between\nfood and intellectual\nperformance. Tony\nCripps reveals how\neating sensibly could\nprovide a mental\nboost to help exam\nsuccess.\n>in\nFood for Thought V ll It's exam time. Endless study and revision\nmakes you hungry but you feel guilty taking\ntime off to cook for yourself or to go out for\na meal. Instead you choose to save time by\ntaking the convenience route - a burger, fish and\nchips, kebab or the like from the local take-away.\nSounds familiar? In fact, although it may give you\nextra study time, a fast food diet may actually compromise your exam performance.\nA diet containing a lot of saturated fat and cholesterol may not just lead to obesity and heart disease\nbut may also severely curtail intellectual functioning.\nHigh blood cholesterol, and the blood fat triglyceride,\nare associated with depression and consequently with\nreduced levels of concentration and motivation.\nAcademic performance will tend to suffer as a result.\nCharles Glueck of the Jewish Hospital,\nCincinnati, attributes these effects to 'blood s lud gi ness' caused by saturated fats. This makes it harder\nfor the blood to transport sufficient oxygen to a ravenous brain. Brain activity is consequently\nreduced and, in the long-term, neuron al death may result. This is confirmed by the\npresence of mini brain-lesions and blood\nclots in the brains of experimental rats fed\non a high fat diet. The best advice would be\nto cut down on these foods in your diet if\nyou want to keep up a good academic\nrecord.\nDespite this, some fats are essential to\nhealthy brain functioning, specifically the\nessential fatty acid (EFA) lino leni c acid,\nalso called n3. It is a vital component of\nbrain cell membranes and needs constant\nrefreshing. It is no surprise, then, that a lack\nof n3 is likely to have negative effects on\nbrain function.\nExperiments conducted by William\nConnor, of Oregon Health Services\nUniversity, confirm this idea. A lack of n3 during the\ndevelopment of Rhesus monkeys lead to conspicuous\nneurological defects. In cats, a good supply of n3 protects against brain damage and aids repair when damage occurs as in the case of cerebral stroke.\nThesefindingsgive reason to believe that a lack\nof n3 may compromise intellectual performance in\nadult humans. However, the polyunsaturated oils,\nsuch as sunflower oil, promoted for health reasons\ncontain little n3. Connor argues that rapeseed, soybean and walnut oils would make better alternatives,\nproviding mental, as well as physical, health benefits.\nBetter still is fish oil, the n3 derived from it most\nclosely resembling the cell membranes of neurone s. The old adage that fish is brain food seems to be more\n' The old\nadage that\nfish is brain\nfood seems\nto be more\nthan just an\nold wives'\ntale.'\nthan just an old wive's tale.\nAnother important factor affecting brain power\nis the presence of neurotransmitters (NTs) that carry\nmessages from neurone to neurone. The precursors\nfrom which the body manufactures NTs are also supplied in the diet. A shortage of precursors in what we\neat may result in a deficiency in NTs which can\nseverely disrupt the workings of the brain. Functions\nsuch as memory, attention and mood may be most at\nrisk f your diet does not contain enough NT precursors.\nA good example of this is the shortage of acetylcholine (ACh) in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.\nThis lack of ACh produces a marked impairment of\nmemory. However, according to Barbara Strupp of\nCornell University, raising the level of the precursor,\ncholine, in the diet of Alzheimer's sufferers may help\nto alleviate the problem and slow the degeneration of\nthe brain. A report produced by the American army\nin 1994 indicates that increased choline intake in the\nform of eggs, organ meats (liver, kidneys etc.) and\nleguminous vegetables such as peas and\nbeans, in the diet of normal people may\nhave similar, albeit lesser, effects on memory and reaction time.\nIn addition to EFAs and NT precursors,\nthe brain also needs a continuous supply\nof glucose to power its activity.\nFurthermore, ingesting sugary foods such\nas chocolate (from which glucose is\nobtained] may cause the brain to release\nendorphins, its natural opiates, giving a strong sense of well-being. Experiments\nwith both rats and people have found that\na well-timed shot of glucose can greatly\nimprove mental functioning on a variety\nof tasks.\nPaul Gold, a psychologist at the\nUniversity of Virginia, has found that the\nbiggest improvement in human subjects is\non reading retention tests. This would be of obvious\nadvantage to students cramming for exams but Gold\nadvises caution. Too much glucose can trigger a hypo-gly cae mic response, similar to diabetes, and actually\nreduce mental performance by depleting blood glucose. However, in moderation, sugars such as glucose\nmay well have a beneficial effect on our intellectual\nfunctioning. Try experimenting!\nThe field of nutritional neuroscience is only in its\nearly stages but already the trading s suggest that a more carefully controlled diet may benefit the mind,\nas well as the body. If you choose to try any of these\nmethods to improve exam performance it's probably\nnot advisable to expect success, but you may become\na better cook.\n\n"
