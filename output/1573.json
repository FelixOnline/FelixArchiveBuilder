Imperial\nmedicals RFC were hungry for a win,\nhaving not won a Varsity match since\n2011, a fact that ICU were only too\nhappy to keep repeating in the Felix\nand on social media beforehand.\nOur preparations for the game could\nnot have been better. Undefeated in\nthe league, with promotion all but\nassured, through to the semi-finals of\nthe BUCS cup and in the final of the\nUH Cup, we approached the game\nwith a confidence that had been absent\nin the last few years. In previous years,\n3XV teams had often bought in a host\nof injured or outgoing players of a\nhigher standard for Varsity. But, with\na settled squad and BUCS promotion\non the line, we were strongly against\nsuch tactics this year.\nAnd so, after a rousing team talk,\nthe game began. IC started well, and\ngained some early territory. However,\nthis small patch of dominance was to\nbe their last act of note in the game.\nIC conceded a penalty at the scrum in\nour 22, we were able to clear our lines,\nand soon penned IC back into their\nhalf with some strong carries from\nforwards and backs alike. Soon, they\nconceded another penalty on their\n22m line. Unusually for a 3XV side, we\ndecided to go for points, thinking it\nmight be a close game. Unfortunately\nSam Harrison hit the post with his\nkick. ICRC cleared to touch. A good\ndriving maul was set up from our\nlineout, and rumbled over for a try.\nLaurence Pallant selflessly handing\nthe ball to Joe Simmonds when he was\nwithin scoring reach himself!\nA good period of physical rugby\non our part ensued, with Ranjodh\nSanghera \u2013 fresh from his basketball\nheroics in the copper box \u2013 and Shaan\nRashid ensuring a torrid time for\nanyone foolish enough to run down\nthe centre channels, and breaking\ntackles with ease when they did\nthemselves. This eventually resulted in\nanother penalty, which Sam Harrison\nmade no mistake with this time.\nMinutes later a cracking break from\nJames \u201cRugbyLeague\u201d Turner down\nthe right wing almost bought a second\ntry, only for a heroic tackle from the\nIC no. 8 to deny him, unfortunately\nending the tackler\u2019s participation in\nthe day.\nICtriedtoholdout,buttheirdefence\nwas in vain, as Turner breached their\nbackline with a 70-80m jinking run,\ndodging five or six weak tackles to\nscore his first of the day. Sam Harrison\ncrossed the paint soon after following\na flowing back move, to put a fully\ndeserved gloss onto the first half. At\nhalf time the scores stood at 20-0 to\nIMRFC.\nWhile the medics\u2019 half time team\ntalk revolved around consistency and\nkeeping up the same intensity we\nhad been using, IC\u2019s team talk seems\nto have been \u201cHow many 2s players\ncan we bring on and get away with?\u201d\nUnfortunately, their ploy was made\nless obvious by the fact that one of\nthe wingers forgot to even change the\nshirt he had been wearing in the 2s\ngame.\nAnd so the second half began, and to\nthe disappointment of IC, their newly\nbolstered back line was still no match\nfor Ranj & Shaan in the centres, the\nlatter soon smashing through the IC\nline to score our fourth try of the day.\nSome sustained forward pressure was\nthen rewarded with a sniping try from\nHenry Clancy. He would call it just\nrewards for his hard work \u2013 others\nwould call it opportunistic. The pack\ncontinued to dominate, and another\nrolling maul led to supersub James\nBloomer flopping over for a try.\nThe medics were still not done\nthough. There was time for Turner to\nscore another fantastic solo effort, only\nslightly worsened by how far away he\nkicked the ball in celebration. Captain\nFantastic himself then limbered up for\nten minutess of rugby, four months\nearlier than his post surgery comeback\ndate. Despite taking one contact, to\nthe collective gasps of the crowd, all\nshoulders stayed intact and the game\nwas closed out, and to the elation of\nthe medics supporters the rout was\ncomplete.\nFull time:\nImperial Medicals RFC: 44\nImperial College RFC: 0\nThis ended a two year hoodoo,\nsecuredtheleaguetitleandmaintained\nthe 3s\u2019 unbeaten record. The \u2018grand\nslam\u2019 is still on, just the small matter\nof BUCS and UH cups to go!\nI hope that the crowd enjoyed the\nday, despite the fact the free flowing,\noffloading game may not have\ncontained enough \u2018style\u2019 and \u2018dignity\u2019\nfor some. Oh well, there\u2019s always next\nyear.\nGeorge HIll\nICSM 3rd XV Rugby Captain\nMedics 3rd XV crush\nCollege 44-0\nWith Varsity being the 1s\u2019 final match\nof the season, at home on a beautiful\nWednesday afternoon, we were\ndetermined to finish on a high. With\nthe KO also being staggered with the\nother matches so that a crowd was\nable to watch from the side-lines, it\nmade the atmosphere all the better\nand both teams were looking ready to\nput everything into the game.\nBoth teams started well, but after a\nshort amount of time it was Imperial\nwho came out on top. There were\ncommitted challenges going in from\nboth sides, but the good pressing of\nImperial meant that the Medics were\nlargely forced to try and lump it up to\ntheir forwards, which the IC defence\ndealt with very well. Imperial, when\nthey had the ball, were moving it very\nwell along the ground and getting into\ngood areas, with wingers Murphy and\nDale regularly beating their opposition\nfull backs as they have done all season.\nSoon enough Imperial broke the\ndeadlock. After a well-worked pass\nand move play involving Murphy\nand Crawford, Crawford released\nRobinson into space with his first\ntouch via a through ball heading to\nthe left of the Medics goal. Easily\noutpacing the defender, Robinson saw\nthe onrushing keeper and finished it\nfirst time with his left foot across the\nkeeper into the side netting of the\nright side of the goal. This was his\n96th goal for Imperial College in four\nyears which average 25 games or fewer\na season. He managed to score 4 on\nthe Saturday after Varsity in order to\ncomplete his Century.\nAfter scoring the first, Imperial were\nwell on top of the game and had the\nlion\u2019s share of possession, repeatedly\nbreaking well and causing problems\nfor the Medics\u2019 defence. They should\nhave had at least another in the first\nhalf after a brilliant one touch move,\nagain involving Crawford and Murphy\nand including a Murphy first time left\nfooted chip over the defence to set\nRobinson free. The move deserved a\nfirst time finish, but Robinson decided\nto take it down on his knee before\nunfortunately firing the resulting\nvolley at the keeper. If it had gone in\nit would have been a contender for\ngoal of the season \u2013 the slick first time\npassing leaving the Medics defenders\nstatic.\nRobinson also saw a well struck\nvolley off of a bouncing through ball\njust go wide, and Murphy saw one or\ntwo long range efforts either be saved\nor just miss the post. The Medics\u2019\nonly chance of note in the first half\nwas when a ball over the top caught\nout an IC centre back, with their\nstriker chasing it down well but then\nproceeding to hesitate for too long\nbefore firing the ball over the bar from\nclose range.\nThefirsthalfended1-0,withImperial\nfeeling that they should have had a few\nmore. 1-0 is a very dangerous score\nline to lead with and Imperial walked\nback onto the pitch for the second half\nlooking to get on top quickly and score\nas soon as possible. Unfortunately,\nquite the opposite happened as it was\nthe Medics who started better. For a\ngood chunk of the first period of the\nsecond half the Medics had most of\nthe ball and were passing around well.\nHowever, unfortunately they weren\u2019t\nable to convert this into a goal.\nSoon enough it was Imperial who\nwere back on top. The Medics were\ngiving away too many free kicks,\nand IC came close on a number of\noccasions. One in particular saw\nPrivate Lee Lawson send a header\ntowards goal, which then ricocheted\noff the keeper back to him. He then\nsmashed a volley from close range\nagainst the cross bar.\nThe second IC goal came after\nImperial camped out in the opposition\nhalf for a while. Nugent passed\ninside from the left to Robinson who\nturned to his right to try and take on\na defender. Being faced with two in\nfront of him, he back-heeled a through\nball into the path of the sprinting\nMurphy, who had just made a loud\ncall to let his presence known on the\nleft wing. Taking it in his stride, he\nfired a first time left footed shot across\nthe keeper into the right corner, and\npeeled off towards the crowd. The\nresulting machine gun celebration left\na pile of bodies and beer on the floor\nby the dugouts, and IC gathered to\ncongratulate him and each other.\nAs they were 2-0 down, the\nMedics spent the last period of the\nmatch switched to a more attacking\nformation, as they threw men\nforward in an attempt to get a goal.\nUnfortunately, all this lead to was\nImperial cleaning them up on the\nbreak down the wings, and if IC had\nbeen more clinical the score line could\nhave been much higher. Robinson saw\na shot off a through ball go just wide of\nthe post, and one saved by the keeper\nfrom close range after twisting a few\ndefenders, while Murphy and Dale,\namongst others, came close to adding\nto their accounts.\nThe game finished 2-0, and even\nthough Imperial should have had a\nfew more, the season ended on a lovely\nhigh, beating the Medics at home on\na thoroughly glorious afternoon. Fair\nplay to the Medics as they never gave\nup and battled well to the end, but I\u2019m\nsure that they will be able to concede\nthat the better team won that day.\nMan of the match was James\nMurphy, next year\u2019s 1s captain who\nplayed his heart out and fully deserved\nthe award. Well done also to Alex\nDale, Omar Amjad, Chris Nielsen\nand Ahmed Cherif who are leaving\nthe club after two, three, three and\nthree years of service respectively,\nit has been a pleasure to play with\nyou. Special mention must also go to\nJonathan \u2018Jonty\u2019 Hill, who played his\nlast match for Imperial College this\nVarsity after eight wonderful years\nof gritty, leg-breaking service. He\nis the definition of a seasoned vet.\nCongratulations and best of luck in\nthe future to both of you.\nCollege produce the goods to take win\nJack Robinson\nIC 1st XI Football Captain\nICSM RUBGY\n\n"

In fact, more doctors\nin the less developed countries such\nas Ghana, Sierra Leone and Syria\nare migrating to the UK because\nof the attractive salary and more\nsophisticated health system. This\nleaves these countries starved of\nhealthcare professionals of which they\nare in dire need.\n57 countries in the less developed\nworld have a \u2018critical shortage\u2019 of\nhealth workers, meaning that there\u2019s\nfewer than 2.5 health care providers\nper 1000 population. 2.4 million extra\ndoctors, nurses and midwives are\nneeded to meet the global demands\nfor health workers.\nThe situation in Ghana is a prime\nexample of the health disparities\nwhich are occurring worldwide. There\nwas a 47% increase in the numbers of\nGhanaian doctors emigrating to more\ndeveloped countries between 1998\nand 2003. Furthermore, the number of\ndoctors who practice in the UK who\nwere trained in Ghana increased by\n110% from 1999 to 2004. The reasons\nfor migration are obvious: better pay\nfor the physicians, a better quality of\nlife and a superior government policy,\nto name a few. Richer countries should\ndo more to alleviate the consequences\nof this \u2018brain drain\u2019.\nInordertohelpthesecountriesoutin\ncaring for the vast numbers of people\nsuffering from infectious diseases,\ndoctors should be encouraged to\nundertake humanitarian missions at\nsome point in their careers. A lack of\ndoctors who are willing to go on these\nhumanitarian duties has urged the\nBritish Medical Association (BMA)\nto act.\nRecently, the BMA announced that\nthey will offer thousands of pounds\nto doctors and nurses in order to\nfund them on humanitarian missions\nabroad. Grants of up to \u00a33000 are\navailable from the BMA, who said:\n\u201cthe cash is intended to help with\ntravel and subsistence costs from a\nfund with a total value of \u00a320,000.\u201d\nIn the future it may be possible\nfor such philanthropic missions to\nbecome a compulsory part of the\nmedical curriculum. In India, this\nhas already happened, from 2015\nall trainee doctors undertaking the\nMBBS course will have to undertake\na mandatory rural posting at a rural\npublic health centre. India\u2019s 148,000\npublic health centres, which are the\nclosest primary care stops for nearby\nvillages, are predominately only run\nby midwives.\nAlthough there is a huge shortage\nof doctors endeavouring to help\nout in less developed countries,\nsome physicians have committed to\nreducing the health inequalities taking\nplace. Barbara Jemic, a reconstructive\nsurgeon who works at the Royal Free\nhospital in London, undertook a\nhumanitarian mission to Sierra Leone\nlast year. She said: \u201cI travelled to Sierra\nLeone to provide essential training\nto a number of local doctors, nurses,\ntherapists and medical students.\nStraightaway I was hit by the stark\ncontrast between the resources,\nfacilities, and level of care accessible\nin the UK compared to the developing\nworld.\u201d\nDavid Nott, a general surgeon at\nChelsea and Westminster hospital,\nhas been labelled the \u2018Indiana Jones\u2019\nof surgery. He has taken unpaid leave\nannually to provide help and to train\ndoctors in warzones for over 20 years.\nStarting in Sarajevo in 1993 and most\nrecently in Syria, he operates, trains\nand innovates in the most extreme\nconditions.\nDr Terry John, chair of the BMA\u2019s\ninternational committee, who was\nbehind the idea of funding doctors to\nhelp out in less developed countries,\nsaid \u201c... it is incredibly inspiring to hear\nof colleagues showing great drive,\ncourage and enthusiasm to improve\nthe lives of patients across the world.\u201d\nThe people who embark on these\nmagnificent journeys lead by example\nin the world of medicine. Future\ndoctors should be inspired by the\ndifference they are making and\nshould strive to reduce global health\ninequalities.\nA call for doctors\nThree is no longer a crowd\nTom Stroud\nContributor\nP\nancreatic cancer has the\nlowest survival rate out\nof the common cancers;\nonly three percent make\nit past five years, with the\nmajority only making it to 4-6 months\nafter diagnosis. The campaign aimed\nto improve public awareness regarding\nthis. Its tagline portrayed how those\nwith pancreatic cancer wished they\nhad other types which have better\nsurvival rates and well researched\ntreatment options hence the named\n\u2018envy\u2019 campaign. Kerry, a sufferer\nherself, said she honestly wished\nshe had breast cancer. She pushed\nfor pancreatic cancer to gain more\nattention and in consequence more\nfunding for research to help people\nlike her, which is definitely positive\nand to be applauded. However, the\ncomparing of different cancers is a\ncontroversial concept, which evoked\nstrong opinions, especially from those\nwith the identified \u2018preferable\u2019 cancers\nlike breast cancer.\nPancreatic cancer doesn\u2019t result\nin symptoms until its late stages\nof development, when it can cause\nthe unspecific symptoms of upper\nabdominal pain that intermittently\nspreads to the back, weight loss,\njaundice and diabetes. These are\nimportant to spot early on, report\nto a doctor and if necessary obtain\nadequate medical attention to slow its\nrelatively rapid progression and raise\nits poor survival rates. So of course the\npublic need to be informed about it.\nNevertheless the comparison to\ndifferent cancers in my opinion was\noff key. Its main flaw I think was that\nit seemed to trivialise other forms of\ncancer by pitching the survival figures\nagainst each other. Every cancer is\ndevastating to an individual and their\nfamily; looking past the numbers it\nis the context of the disease which is\nimportant. With more than a third of\npeopleintheUKwhowillbediagnosed\nwith cancer in their lifetime we are\nlikely to experience this. And yes of\ncourse pancreatic cancer sufferers\nwill wish for a better outlook but that\nis true for any situation and speaking\nplainly encouraging comparisons\nbetween cancers is not helpful.\nI admire Kerry and support the drive\nfor public health awareness but think\nthere are different more helpful angles\nto do so. Perhaps, focusing on hope\nand defiance in the face of cancer, as\nthe Irish Cancer Society has recently,\nwill garner a more positive response.\nThe campaigning charity \u201cwill never\nforget Kerry who will be dearly\nmissed, and remain in the hearts and\nthoughts of all of us at Pancreatic\nCancer Action\".\nEmily Plummer\nContributor\nThe Cancer Envy Campaign\nThe recent campaigner for \u2018Pancreatic Cancer Action\u2019, Kerry Harvey, just a few\nweeks ago at 24 years old. PANCREATICCANCERACTION.ORG\nW\ne are even closer\nto seeing Britain\nbecome the first\ncountry in the\nworld to allow a\nthree person baby to be born through\nIVF, as draft rules were announced last\nweek to regulate the process. This is in\nan attempt to help mothers with faulty\nmitochondria bear healthy children.\nMitochondria are the \u2018powerhouses\u2019\nof cells, where respiration occurs, and\ncontain 0.2% of genetic material. They\nare inherited solely from the mother.\nIf the DNA in them is mutated, then\nthis can result in children inheriting\nmitochondrial disease, which severely\naffects 1 in 6500 children \u2013 more than\nthat affected by childhood cancer.\nThese disease-free IVF babies would\nbe created with the genetic material\nfrom the two parents but using a donor\nembryo with the nucleus removed.\nThis would mean the baby would\ninherit the donor\u2019s mitochondria but\nonly the parents\u2019 DNA. The draft rules\ncurrently proposed suggest that the\nchildren will not be able to find out\nthe identity of the donor \u2013 in a similar\nmanner to that of organ donors. These\nregulations still need to be reviewed\nas part of a public consultation but\ncould be legislation by early 2015. It\nis predicted that only ten cases a year\nwould qualify for the procedure, as\nonly the worst affected women would\nbe eligible. The Department of Health\nfully backs the proposals and have\nstated that the review is not about\nwhether it should be permitted or\nnot but merely about how we should\nregulate it. While some herald this\nas a great start towards combating\nmitochondrial disease, others are\nmuch more sceptical about the ethics\nbehind this and claim it is one step\nfurther towards \u2018designer babies\u2019.\nNadiah Fernandes\nContributor\n\n"

They were soon gaining\nterritory themselves in the College\nhalf, and this time they made no\nmistake. After numerous phases,\nscrum half Andrew Barrie was able to\nmake a quick dash to the line, making\nsure to place the ball under the posts.\nOutside Centre OIiver Clough slotted\nover the posts to put the medics into\nan early 7-3 lead.\nSoon the medics were pushing\nagain, but with no try in sight\nClough chose to take the points, and\nnonchalantly dropkicked the ball\nthrough the sticks to extend the lead\nby 3 points. The boot of Clough was\nto become something that the medics\ncould depend on during the course of\nthe game.\nThe next five minutes turned out\nto be one of the few passages of play\nin which the College dominated.\nHowever, for all their determination\nand effort, they were unable to score\nthe try that would have given them\nthe confidence that they needed to\nreally kick on and win the game.\nAfter another medic infringement the\nCollege chose to go for the points and\nfly half James Cox took them gleefully\nto pull the game back to 10-6.\nThis brief period could not provide\nthe College with much respite, and\nsoon they were again defending\ndeep into their own territory. Just\nas it seemed as though the College\nhad defended their line admirably\nand, more importantly, successfully,\nClough again showed great skill as\nhe kicked into the corner to force a\nlineout on the five-metre line. This\nwas to prove very fruitful, as after\nmore phases of rugby the Medics were\nable to push over the line. This time\nit was in the form of former England\nInternational Tom Rees, who was\nplaying for the medics at number 8.\nAs usual, Clough knocked over the\npenalty; it was suddenly 17-6 with five\nminutes to go until half time.\nCollege could have been forgiven\nat this stage if they were looking\nforward to ten minutes of respite\nin the dressing room, but before\nthat the medics had more plans. An\nelementary catch was fluffed on the\nhalf way line by the College to hand the\nmedics put in at the scrum with three\nminutes to go. They kept pushing,\nbefore finally being awarded a penalty\nwithin kickable range. That human\nmetronome Clough took the chance\nand with the last kick of the half took\nthe medics into a commanding 20-6\nlead.\nAny chance of a College comeback\ntook an early hit as Clough kicked a\ndrop goal over the posts within the\nfirst two minutes of the second half\nto extend the lead to a very healthy 17\npoints.\nHowever, this didn\u2019t stop the\nCollege, who now entered another\nperiod of domination. At one stage\nit really looked as though this move\nwould not prevail, but captain\nMichael O\u2019Connell was determined\nand it was him who went over the line\nto score the College\u2019s first and only try.\nHowever, in a move that summed up a\nwretched evening for the College, the\nconversion was missed, leaving the\nscore at 23-11.\nHowever, this was to be the last sniff\nof scoring that the College had, as the\nmedics showed their superiority in the\nlast 20 minutes of the game. It was not\nlong before this pressure told on the\nCollege, as the Medics went over to\nput yet another 7 points on the board,\nand in doing so extend the score to 30-11.\nBy this stage it was clearly over for\nthe College, but there was still the\nchance of restoring some pride by\nmaking the scoreline seem closer.\nBut this was not to be, as the medics\nkept applying pressure to the College\ndefence. The College eventually\nsuccumbed to the pressure that the\nmedics were applying when wing\nChidi Nzekwue went over under the\nposts to add another five points. As\nusual, Oliver Clough slotted over to\ntake the lead to 37-11.\nIt was not long after this that the\nwhistle blew on what was a great\nmatch with plenty of excitement.\nOliver Clough was the stand out\nperformer for the medics, with his\nboot gaining them 17 points, as well\nas a 100 percent kicking record.\nBut, for the College, it was a year of\ndashed dreams and they returned to\nthe College knowing that if they are\nto win back the JPR Williams Cup\nnext year it will need a much stronger\nperformance, as the medics really\nshowed their superiority and their\nclass in this fixture.\nE.

The stage was set\nfor a wonderful afternoon of football.\nThe trip over was, however, ruined by\nthe news that the 3rd team goalkeeper\nhad pulled out and therefore through\nstandard hierarchical process our\ngoalkeeper had to play for the 3s. Our\nregular goalkeeper had phoned in sick\nthe previous night but bravely agreed\nto power through the pain and make\nhis way over to West London. Sean\ndid not arrive until after kick-off so\nsubstitute Liam had to stand in for him\nfor about ten minutes. It was a great\neffort from Liam, not letting a goal in.\nA dishevelled Sean took his spot in the\ngoal and immediately had to make one\nof his hallmark great saves.\nWith the full team on the pitch\nand the status quo restored, the team\ncould now properly focus on the task\nat hand. At the pre-match meeting\nit was proposed that we play a half-pitch press, a strategy meaning we\nwould defend very deep in our own\nhalf. This is entirely reliant on good\ndiscipline from everyone, especially\nthe mid-fielders who must track back\nas soon as they loose possession. From\nthe start of the game it was clear that\nthe opposition would play the way we\nthought they would. They dominated\npossession. It was a matter of making\nsure they didn\u2019t make anything from\nit. The first half showed perfect\nexecution of that game plan, as they\nwere completely unable to create any\nAdam Rossiter\nICSM 4th XI Football Captain\nSpirited match ends in a\n0-0 draw\nreal chances.\nThe second half was much the same\nand it was clear the opposition were\ngetting frustrated and tired. It was now\nthe time for us to seize our chances on\nthe counter attacks, notably down the\nwings as Hugo made great runs with\nthe ball into their penalty box. He\nshould have been awarded a penalty\nafter being clipped in the back of the\nlegs without falling over. The referee\ncan be quoted as saying \u201cIf he had\ngone down then I would have given it\u201d.\nAnotherinexplicabledecisionfromthe\nreferee came in the 85th minute when\nthe opposition centre-back displayed\na despicable piece of unsportsmanlike\nconduct. He deliberately hand-balled\nat the half way line, hence preventing\nour rapid striker Will from getting\nto the ball and having a one-on-one\nwith their keeper. The fact that the\nreferee stopped play even though the\nadvantage could have been played as\nWill could have made it, but didn\u2019t\nsend off or even book the culprit, is\nbeyond belief.\nIt was 0-0 at the close, overall a\ngreat result against all the odds. To\nput things into context, this is a team\nthat is four leagues above us, and also\ntop of their division. This performance\nwas a great showing of the willpower\nand discipline of the team and one we\ncan all be proud of and that needs to\nspur us on in the upcoming UH Cup\nsemi-final. A special mention to Hugo\nfor his input at the team meeting as\nour tactics proved to be successful.\nAnother mention to James who broke\nhis toe near the end of the game,\nSean our goalie, Stephen our man\nof the match and lastly to Harry for\nsupporting us on the side-lines while\nhe recovers from injury.\nIC 2nd XI swatted aside a shambolic\nMedic \u2018football\u2019 team, who probably\nwould have preferred to spend their\nday enjoying the sunshine instead of\npicking the ball out of their net. Whilst\nwe would love to divulge and expand\non this simple victory, it really isn\u2019t\nworth our time. We hope that next\nyear the medics can put up a fight, or\nat least improve their abysmal chat; \u201cI\nDaniel Moxham\nIC 2nd XI Captain\nCollege 2nd XI swat\naside \u201cshambolic\u201d\nMedics team 3-0\ndon\u2019t care that we\u2019re losing 3-0, I have\na girlfriend at home\u201d was a particularly\nwitty quip from their number 10, who\nincidentally missed a penalty with\nprobably his only touch of the game.\nBetter luck next year boys.\nGoals:\nDom Affron x2, Andy Sear-Black\nAssists: Will Wilson, Kume Feese,\nDan Moxham\nMOTM: Will Wilson.\nVarsity day finally arrived in the form\nof a sunny afternoon ideal for the 7s\nmatch ahead. The medics had a point\nto prove, having lost last year to IC for\nthe first time in recent memory.\nDuring the opening phases of the\ngame, both teams were well matched\nwith solid defence from both sides,\nand neither team looking to threaten.\nAfter retaining possession and\nrecycling well, Medics drew first\nblood when Kath Fok handed off the\nopposition in midfield from the 22\nto run in the try under the posts and\ncomplete the resulting conversion.\nThe medics edged towards the line\nagain, with Sarah Burns carrying\nthe ball from around the breakdown\ntowards IC\u2019s try line. Charlie Stephens\ncut back inside and crashed through\ntwo tackles from the 5m line to score\nthe Medic\u2019s second under the posts.\nAt half time, Medics were ahead 14-0.\nIC were strong in the scrum and\nhooker Lana Lee managed to steal\npossession on the medics\u2019 put in.\nHowever, Lizzie Robison put in several\ngood tackles which led to a turnover\njust inside the Medics\u2019 half. Kath Fok\ndrew in two of the opposition off the\nback of a scrum. Wakana Teranaka\nran a dummy line which fooled IC\u2019s\nlast man allowing the ball to go wide\nto Sammy for the Medic\u2019s 3rd try.\nReacting well to a loose ball from\nthe Medics\u2019 line out and drawing\nseveral tackles, IC then went wide.\nAlice Liberman sprinted down the\ntouchline, just evading her nearest\ndefender. Spinning back inside, she\ndodged two further cover tackles to\nscore by the corner flag. Unable to\nmake the conversion, IC were coming\nback, with the score standing at 21-5.\nBut the medics responded, making\ntheir way again into the IC\u2019s half.\nRan Xiong was always in support to\nruck over and retain possession. Ellie\nStewart sent a quick ball out from the\nruck which allowed Sammy Gottardi\nto use her pace and run wide around\nthe shaken IC defensive line.\nIC were to have the last score,\ntaking advantage of their extra subs.\nThe Medics were outnumbered and\nfatigue was setting in when IC\u2019s Pip\nHeggie ran through at pace, and drew\nin three Medic defenders to make the\ntackle. From there, IC quickly went\nwide again to send Clara Gago over\nfor the final try.\nStill, Medics put in a great\nperformance to reclaim the Varsity\nvictory. Final score 26-10.\nKatherine Fok\nICSM Women\u2019s Rugby Captain\nMedics dominate and\nbeat College 26-10\nIC5s had an incredible start to the\nmatch. During the first quarter, all\ncentre passes were carefully turned\ninto goals and successive rebounds\nwere secured by our GK Madina\nWane.\nWith the ball being down at our\nattacking third for 90% of the time\nand some lovely movement between\nAmy West and Sarah Howarth, IC\nheroically wrapped up the first fifteen\nminutes with a 7 goal advantage at 11-4.\nIt didn\u2019t take the medics long before\nthey were fully alerted; they were in\ntheir defensive mode as soon as the\ntimer started ticking again.

Their\nspectators were cheering louder than\nbefore every time their shooters send\nthe ball through the hoop and our\nhearts sank even further.\nWith panic and fear hovering over\nour team, the ball was going down our\nend at very fast pace and was turned\nover repeatedly. The uprising pressure\nhas also unfortunately reduced our\nshooting accuracy. We were overtaken\nat the final quarter and were not able\nto turn the table around. The final\nscore was 20-28 to ICSM.\nIt was a great match despite victory\nnot being on our side. Our score in the\nfirst quarter was the highest on record\nand our girls have performed at a very\nhigh standard \u2013 credit to everyone\u2019s\n110% effort!

We put our all into\nthe game, but despite our efforts, the\nmedic shooters were on great form\nand the game ended 39-14 to the\nmedics. Our man of the match was\nRach Shuttleworth who played GK.\nIn terms of what went wrong I think\nthat our constantly changing team\nformation due to players moving\nEmma Needham\nIC 4s Netball Captain\nIC 4s defeated\ncomfortably by Medics\nup to the 3rd team, dropping out\nor not being able to play varsity for\nvarious reasons meant that some of\nour players had only played together\na few times, and the team had never\nall played together in a competitive\nmatch situation. Another definite\nreason for our defeat was that not\nenough matches are scheduled for the\n4s in our BUCS league; we only started\nout with 5 teams in the league and two\ndropped out throughout the season.\nConsidering the number of changes\nin our team throughout the netball\nyear, I think we played as well as we\ncould have. We managed 7 more goals\nthan last year and I\u2019m sure the 4s will\ncontinue to improve in the future!\n\n"

But rather, it is\ngrowing from a bottom up approach \u2013 building on a multitude\nof systems that do not follow one blueprint, but have found\ndifferent answers to questions like cap-setting, allocation,\nscope, and flexibility provisions\nA\nt the end of February,\nNick Clegg and energy\nsecretary Ed Davey\nannounced a joint\ndeal with Shell for the\nretrofitting of the Peterhead gas fired\npower station in Scotland with Carbon\nCapture Storage (CCS) technology.\nWhilst the UK would lead the world\nwith such a project, there has always\nbeen a black cloud of doubt over CCS\nas a way to meet our ambitious CO2\nemission targets.\nThe Peteterhead power station\nmanaged to beat off several other\ncontenders to become one of two\npowerstationstowinthegovernment\u2019s\nCCS competition. The signing of the\ndeal marks the first major step in the\nproject by commissioning a front-end\nengineering and design (FEED) study.\nOn completion, the plant will have the\nability to power around half a million\nhomes with clean energy by removing\nup to a million tons of CO2 emissions\nper year.\nThe \u00a3100m project will capture\nup to 90% of the emissions from\none of the plant\u2019s three gas turbines,\nsimultaneously cleaning up the North\nSea gas feedstocks whilst creating\nup to 2000 jobs in the construction,\noperation and technical management\nof the CCS system. The deal with Shell\nwillmakePeterheadthefirstlargescale\nlarge gas power station in the world to\ncapture its carbon emissions and the\nexcitement over this was captured by\nDeputy Prime minister Nick Clegg\nwho stated that \u201cit shows we can build\na stronger economy and do it fairly by\nprotecting our environment for future\ngenerations.\u201d\nWhilst the optimistic mind-set of\nMr Clegg is certainly quite appealing,\nit is well worth examining CCS more\ndeeply to grasp why it has taken off\nrelatively slowly despite having been\ninitially developed a relatively long\ntime ago. CCS is touted for great\nthings with the IPCC estimating its\neconomic potential to be between 10%\nand 55% of the total carbon mitigation\neffort until year 2100. Despite this, it\nhas to date been fraught with major\nconcerns over economic efficiencies\nand technological hurdles. CCS\nhas actually been around for many\ndecades but is yet to proven effectively\nat the scale of large power stations.\nThe main concerns have been\naround the successful joining up the\nall the parts of the process, namely\ncapture, transportation and storage,\na task that has proven notoriously\ndifficult. Furthermore, given that all\nparts of the process work, there still\nremains concern over the costs of\nrunning a CCS system and many have\nquestioned whether it is really worth\nits traditionally enormous price tag.\nFurther still, it must be remembered\nthat attempts to initiate role out of\nCCS have failed with the UK\u2019s previous\nCCS competition attempt having\ncollapsed. Whilst the announcement\nof the Peterhead project is a hugely\nexciting one, dredging up of such\nmemories should remind us to\nproceed with caution but should in no\nway thwart ambition.\nA\nnew report released in\nFebruary has shown\nlast year to have been\na record year for the\nimplementation of new\ncarbon trading schemes around the\nglobe in an effort to help curb carbon\nemissions. Whilst China, the world\u2019s\nlargest greenhouse gas emitter has\nled the way with five new schemes,\nEurope has had to make adjustments\nto its scheme to ensure it remains fit\nfor purpose.\nChina\u2019s five schemes implemented\nlast year make up over half the total of\nnine schemes implemented globally,\nthe other four being in Kazakhstan,\nSwitzerland, Quebec and California.\nThe Chinese schemes are at the\nmetropolitan and provincial level\nand will act as precursors to the\nimplementation at the national level in\nthe near future. Such activity is highly\nsignificant and marks a clear move\nawayfromusingcommandandcontrol\nmeasures such as bans and standards\nto reduce emissions, towards a more\nmarket based approach.\nThe report which is the first of its\nkind is produced by the International\nCarbon Action Partnership (ICAP)\nand is designed to fulfil the monitoring\nrequirement necessary to ensure\ncarbon trading schemes are effective\nin reducing emissions globally as their\nprevalence increases. The report,\nwhich will be published annually, will\nallow countries to learn from each\nother in how best to implement the\nschemes. In a press release the ICAP\nstated \u201cThe global carbon market\nhas not happened in a harmonised,\ntop-down fashion as expected by\npolicymakers and analysts in the\n1990s and early 2000s. But rather, it is\ngrowing from a bottom up approach\n\u2013 building on a multitude of systems\nthat do not follow one blueprint,\nbut have found different answers to\nquestions like cap-setting, allocation,\nscope, and flexibility provisions\u201d.\nThe report also details how Europe\nwill have to make major alterations to\nensure its carbon market continues\nto operate effectively. The European\nEmissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS)\nis one of the EU\u2019s cornerstone policies\nto combat climate change and whilst it\nis the oldest and largest scheme of its\nkind, it has suffered severe problems\nsuch as the steep drop in carbon\nprice following the 2008 economic\ncrisis. The ICAP report makes\nimplementation recommendations on\nthe proposed EU \u2018backloading scheme\u2019\nwhere 900 million carbon credits will\nbe held back from entering the market\nto spur activity.\n2013 was a great year for\nimplementing new carbon trading\nschemes and guidance provided by the\nnew ICAP report in integrating and\nunifying what has thus far been a piece\nmeal, bottom up approach, means that\n2014 may well be even better.\nA\nstudy published this\nmonth has displayed\nthe possibility that a\ndoctor\u2019s stethoscope\ncould be a major source\nof bacterial transmission in clinical\npractice. The study, published in an\nissue of Mayo Clinic Proceedings,\nexposed how stethoscopes contain a\nhuge number of bacteria relative to a\ndoctor\u2019s hands.\nThe results found the diaphragm\nof a stethoscope (the larger side) to\ncontain more bacteria than every part\nof the hand except the fingertips. One\nof the strains of bacteria found on the\nstethoscopes was the multi-resistant\nMRSA. The authors concluded that\nevery physician should clean their\nstethoscope after every patient\nexamination.\nThis is not the first time the\nprospect of stethoscopes being a key\ncause of infection has been disclosed.\nWay back in 1972, an article in The\nLancet examined 100 stethoscopes\nfrom doctors of different specialties\nin a London hospital and found\nthem all to contain large amounts of\nbacteria, including the food poisoning\nstaphylococci bacteria.\nDr. Didier Pittet, director of\nthe Infection Control Program at\nUniversity of Geneva Hospitals, in\nSwitzerland said, \u201cThe important\nimplication is that the stethoscope,\nwhether used by a doctor, a nurse, an\nassistant nurse or any staff, needs to\nbe cleansed after each use.\u201d\nHopefully, doctors will follow the\nadvice of the experts and think of\nthe stethoscope as an extension of\ntheir fingertips, in order to reduce the\nlethal transmission of multi-resistant\nbacteria.\nThe UK to lead the world with new\nCarbon Capture Storage project\nDirty Stethoscopes\nTom Stroud\nContributor\nLawrence D\u2019Silva\nEnvironment & Health Editor\nRecord uptake of new carbon trading schemes in 2013 says new global report\nSHELL\nFox News\nLawrence D\u2019Silva\nEnvironment & Health Editor\ndoug ross @ Journal\nWant to write for the Environment\n& Health Section?\nSend us an email at\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

You can you can take her\nat her word, if you think that she\u2019s\nalready had the opportunity to reveal\nany feelings, then you have to trust her.\nYou can\u2019t go through life, taking into\naccount any emotions that you\u2019re not\nbeing told about. If she does get upset,\nyou have nothing to feel guilty about,\nso don\u2019t worry too much about it. Or\nyou can explicitly bring it up with her,\nwhich might make it awkward if she\u2019s\na bit embarrassed about it. As long as\nshe has, at some point, said that she\u2019s\nnot interested, then you\u2019re free to\nbelieve that.\nHelp! My friend set me up with one of\nher friends, and we\u2019ve been on three\ndates, sleeping together after the third.\nAs we were about to have sex, she told\nme that she wasn\u2019t the sort of girl to do\nthis, and asked me if I was seeing other\npeople,towhichIhonestlyrepliedthatI\nwasn\u2019t. I\u2019m now worried that she might\nthink that we\u2019re exclusive, and I\u2019m not\nready for that sort of commitment with\nher. What should I do?\nPolyamorous in Peckham\nAfter three dates with someone that\nyou didn\u2019t know previously, you can\u2019t\nbe fully exclusive. While she may have\ngot that impression from your answer,\nit doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re not free\nto pursue other people. However, as\nsoon as you decide that you want a\nrelationship with her, you should stop\nseeing any other people, as she may\nnot bring it up again. She\u2019s clearly the\ntype of girl who prizes exclusivity, so\nmake sure that you\u2019re aware of that,\nand treat her accordingly.\nHelp! I\u2019ve been sleeping with someone\nfor a couple of months, with neither of\nus seeing other people, despite never\nhaving discussed our relationship.\nLast week, I got very drunk, and\nkissed someone else. I don\u2019t think it\nwould happen again, and they don\u2019t\nremember, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big\ndeal. Should I confess?\nIntoxicated in Imperial Wharf\nIf you\u2019ve never discussed the status\nof your relationship, then you\u2019re\ntechnically free to do whatever you\nwant. However, if neither of you have\nbeen seeing other people, and you\u2019ve\nbeen seeing each other for a while,\nyou might have to face the fact that\nthe other may be upset if you get with\nsomeone else. If you think that they\u2019re\nlikely to find out, I think that you\nshould tell them, because it\u2019ll sound a\nlot better coming from you. If there\u2019s\nno way that they\u2019ll find out, and you\ndon\u2019t think that it\u2019s likely to repeat\nitself, then there\u2019s really no point in\nmentioning it.\nHelp! I really like this girl, and I\u2019m\nreally keen to start dating her, but\nshe\u2019s very similar to my ex-girlfriend\nin every possible way, and my friends\nkeep making fun of me. How can I\nconvince them that this real, and I\u2019m\nnot trying to substitute my ex?\nWooing in Woolwich\nYour friends are probably just joking\nbecause they know that you won\u2019t\nbe particularly offended by it. If they\nwere seriously concerned that you\nweren\u2019t over your ex, then they would\ntalk to you about it, instead of taking\nthe piss. You shouldn\u2019t have to justify\nanything to your friends, they should\naccept whoever you want to see\n(though they should offer advice if you\nthink it\u2019s needed).

Here are some things\nthat Annie has discovered about the world of sex from her\n(relatively small and unrepresentative) sample.\nPeople of nine different nationalities are represented in this\nmini-survey. Although Annie has been known to swing the\nother way, sex with 14% of the male sexual partners took\nplace within the confines of a relationship, 30% as a one\nnight stand, and the rest somewhere in between. Annie is\nfriends with just over half of these guys on Facebook.\nAround 6% of the men that Annie\u2019s slept with have been\nvirgins, or at least claimed to be.\nExactly the same number of people were older and younger\nthan Annie (41% either way), with 18% being the same age.\n43% of men have asked Annie to put something in their\narse, and 20% demonstrated a fetish at some point.\n50% of sexual partners gave Annie an orgasm at some point\nin their first encounter.\n50% of partners had brown hair, 14% ginger hair, 13% black\nhair, and 23% were blonde. Within this, one person was\narguably bald.\nThe largest penis that Annie admits to having seen hits a\nbell-curve thrashing nine inches, with the smallest being a\nrelatively shy four and a half inches. Annie reports a non-traditional relation between ethnicity and endowment.\nAnnie has had sex with 18% of these partners at some\npoint in a public place, which is coincidentally the same\nnumber of people who were \u201cotherwise attached\u201d at the\ntime (although not always to Annie\u2019s knowledge).\nAt Imperial, Annie\u2019s sampled scientists, engineers, and\nmedics.

    "content": "6 FRIDAY 21 MAR\nFEATURES\nEditor: Shiladitya\nGhosh\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nHow has your life changed as a\nresult of writing House of Cards?\nIt totally\u2026 I wrote it as an accident.\nI wrote it as a result of a bet. Actually,\nI didn\u2019t even write it as a bet, I was\nchallenged on a holiday to see if I\ncould write a book and I was really\nbored and had nothing else to do\non holiday. I\u2019m very bad on holiday\nso I sat down beside the swimming\npool that afternoon with a pad and a\npencil and a bottle of wine and I said\n\u201cI wonder if I could write a book?\u201d.\nNot in a serious way, but in a way\nthat many people climb Ben Nevis.\nYou climb Ben Nevis \u2013 it\u2019s been done\na million times before. You climb it,\nyou get there at the top and there\u2019s a\nsense of fulfilment and achievement in\ngetting there, but nobody in the entire\nworld pays the slightest bit of notice\nas it\u2019s all been done a million times\nbefore. That\u2019s what I thought that it\nwould be like.\nSo, I started writing this book. I\nfound myself really enjoying the\nwhole process. It sort of took off and\ntransformed my life. It totally changed\nmy life for all the right reasons. And it\nwas a complete accident!\nAs well as your boredom, was there\nanything else that inspired you?\nI had just finished helping Margaret\nThatcher fight in the 1987 general\nelection campaign, which was a very\nbruising experience. Mrs. Thatcher\nwas desperately unkind to me at\nthe time, and I was feeling a bit sore\nand I was sulking a bit. I had been\nworking incredibly hard for several\nyears leading up to that election. I\nwas feeling battered and bruised and\nI think that must have had some sort\nof influence on me because as I said\nI went by the pool with my pad and\nmy pencil and a bottle of wine. By the\ntime the bottle of wine was finished all\nI had on my pad were two initials, two\nletters: \u2018FU\u2019. I guess that was a sort of\ntherapy. And the F.U. became Francis\nUrquhart, Frank Underwood, and as I\nsay it changed the rest of my life.\nWhere did the name Urquhart come\nfrom as it is a rather unusual name?\nIt\u2019s U. If you go to the telephone\ndirectory for U, there are actually a\nvery small number of names that begin\nwith U. Unwin, Underwood, Upright\n\u2013 there isn\u2019t really a huge selection.\nI thought that the name Urquhart\nhad a rather nice Scottish flavour to\nit, a slightly mysterious flavour to\nit, a slightly noble flavour to it and I\nwanted him to have a background. It\nwas really picked at random.\nTo what extent was the Final Cut\n(Season three of the BBC House\nof Cards) inspired by Margaret\nThatcher\u2019s downfall?\nWell... You raise a slightly difficult\npoint\u2026 I fell out with the BBC and\nyou will not find my name on the Final\nCut, the television series. That was\nbecause I don\u2019t think that they had\ntaken any notice of the book. So it\nwasn\u2019t at all inspired by Mrs Thatcher,\nit was inspired by other people.\nThe BBC did a wonderful version of\nthe House of Cards, and in all honesty,\nthe television series was much better\nthan my amateurish attempt at writing\na book. By the time it got to the third\none, the \u2018Final Cut\u2019, the book was much\nbetter that the TV series. The writing\nimproved and the television series,\nsadly, almost disappeared during the\nfinal series.\nWhat do you like about the British\nand the American adaptations? Do\nyou have any preferences? They are\nso different having been adapted to\ndifferent cultures\u2026\nDifferent cultures, different times.\nWe\u2019re actually talking a whole\ngeneration later. House of Cards was\nwritten when mobile phones were\nscarcely featured. Now, of course,\nthere are all sorts of technologies that\ncompletely dominate our lives.\nWhich one do I prefer? It would be\nlike asking Mo Farah which one of his\nOlympic titles he prefers, the 5000m\nor the 10,000m. They are different,\nbut I really do feel as if I\u2019ve won two\nOlympic gold medals. Ian Richardson\n[BBC] delivered superbly, Kevin\nSpacey [Netflix] is just magnificent\nand I relish the difference. I would\nhate for one to be a copy of the other!\nAnd let\u2019s face it, we are at the early\nstages of the American version. So, it\nwill go on for a third series now and\nit might go on even further than that.\nWe\u2019ll wait and see. But I will say this,\nthe American version and dealing\nwith Kevin Spacey and all the people\ninvolved in it has been and continues\nto be the happiest professional\nexperience of my life. They are\nbrilliant, they are wonderful people,\nthey are incredibly professional and\nthey are very warm and supportive.\nAnd I have a huge buzz working with\nthem and being with them.\nTo what extent are you involved in\nthe Netflix production of House of\nCards?\nI\u2019m an executive producer and I\nprovided the original concept of the\ncharacters and what they will do and\nwhat motivates them. I\u2019m in touch\nwith them [the team] pretty much\nevery week, but because I\u2019m in here\nand they\u2019re there. While I go over to\nthe States quite a lot, there\u2019s a real\nlimit onto actually how much I can put\ninto it. I don\u2019t do any of the writing,\nthat is done by a team of writers\nunder a wonderful man called Beau\nWillimon and that\u2019s taking place in\nNew York right now. I can\u2019t be both in\nNew York and here; I have obligations\nhere. I am there to help them along, to\ngive them any advice that they want,\nto cheer them along, and to help sell\nit \u2013 absolutely! And to enjoy every\nmoment of it! In all honesty, if I fell\nunder a bus tomorrow, it would still\ngo on \u2013 and so it should! It\u2019s a real\nteam effort. I think that there are very\nfew irreplaceable people in the entire\nwork; Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright\nbeing the two very obvious ones. They\nare brilliant. I have watched them\ndo their scenes and they are very\nfunny offstage. Spacey is a real comic!\nWhile they are waiting for the sets to\nbe rigged they are laughing, joshing\naround, playing games, and all of a\nsudden they change! They go onto the\nset and what you see on the screen\nis this extraordinary, extraordinary\ncouple. I think they are dynamite,\nand I can see many of those scenes\nbeing acted out on stage because they\nare really theatrical and crackle with\nelectricity.\nAfter your first book, House of\nCards, you went on to have a very\nsuccessful writing career. What\nmade you continue and what tips\nwould you have for budding writers?\nI enjoyed the freedom of it because\nyou indulge yourself, you decide what\nis you want to write, where it is you\nwant to go, who is it you want to meet\n\u2013 so it\u2019s incredibly indulgent! It is also\nterrifying. It is desperately competitive\nand you never really know from one\nbook to the next what\u2019s going to\nhappen to your world. And when you\nhave family responsibilities, it is a real\nchallenge. It\u2019s that terror that gets you\nout of bed in the morning and pushes\nyou that step further. So, never take\nit for granted. I so much prefer it to a\ncorporate life, being, I guess, my own\nboss. So many people come to me\nsaying \u201cI want to write a book. How\ndo I do it?\u201d And I say it\u2019s very simple\n\u2013 you sit down at a desk, and get out\nyour pen or keyboard and start. There\nare so many reasons for putting it off,\nand there is only one way to do it and\nthat\u2019s to get on with it! Until I started\nI hadn\u2019t the slightest idea whether I\ncould write or not. It was a voyage of\ndiscovery. I still don\u2019t regard myself as\nbeing a great writer, I regard myself\nas being a competent writer and I\u2019m\nlearning all the time. There are very\nfew great writers, but you can make\nyourself a much, much better writer\nby working very hard at it \u2013 which is\nwhat I\u2019ve been doing for almost \u2026 27\nyears now!\nDo you have any favourite writers?\nOh loads, yes. Being a writer opens\nyour imagination to all sorts of things,\nand I found, at least in my case, that it\nopened my eyes, my mind to all sorts\nof different writers. Many people are\ncomfortable with one style of writing,\none style of book, one genre, and\nI suppose that I was a bit like that.\nNowadays I read almost anything, and\nas long as it is well written I can get\nsomething out of it. The problem is one\nis so busy writing and doing everything\nelse that the chance to sit down and\nread for joy are a bit restricted. I have\na bookcase at home which I have built\nfor my retirement and I\u2019ve stuffed\nit, and I am still stuffing it, full of all\nthe great novels that I have wanted\nto spend my time reading. Many, for\ninstance, are American novels. I love\nthe freshness of American novels.\nThe Old English novels sort of go to\nmy cultural roots, which is wonderful.\nWhat\u2019s the most recent book that I\nhave read? A book by Simenon, one\nof his Maigret novels, which was\ndelightful. Stirred up all sort of things.\nIt\u2019s of its time, it\u2019s of its place \u2013 which\nis France in the 1930s. It reminds me\nof my childhood when I watched the\nold Maigret films on television. It\u2019s a\nvery slim little volume; it only takes a\nfew hours to read, but it is full of joy.\nI think that books are like doors into\ndifferent worlds \u2013 you walk through\nthat door and you find yourself in a\ntotally different world. It\u2019s wonderfully\nexciting and it\u2019s so cheap \u2013 much\nbetter than getting on an airplane. It\ntakes you back in time. It takes you\nforward in time. It introduces you\nto so many new characters. It is a\nwonderful, wonderful thing. Whoever\ninvited writing and books ought to be\nvery proud of themselves.\nIt was suggested that having the\nadaptation of House of Cards on\nNetflix made the series more similar\nto a book\u2026\nYes, I can understand what they\nmeant, because it is conceived and\nwritten in a different way. We have 13\nhours of television and it is possible\nto conceive of that like a book with\na beginning, middle and an end. In\ntraditional television you have to write\nan hour and then come to some sort of\nclimax of sort because the viewer then\nhas to go away. You have to engage\nthe viewer to such extent that he or\nshe is going to remember to switch on\nnext week and hopefully remember\nsomething from before. And then\nyou have to have a reprise for two\nminutes at the beginning. It\u2019s a very\nartificial way of entertaining. Whereas\nbeing able to push a button and get\nas much as you want, when you want\nit, is absolutely like a book. You stop\nit when you just want to rest and you\npick it up at your own time where you\nleft it off. And in terms of writing,\ncreating a series, it is very liberating.\nWhen it is conceived as one work,\nas opposed to ten or 13 connected\npieces of work, it allow for much more\ncreative writing.\nYou had fictional characters\nportrayed on screen as well as your\ncolleagues, such as Lady Thatcher.\nHow accurately do you think that\nshe\u2019s been portrayed?\nThe last time I looked she has\nbeen portrayed over thirty times by\ndifferent actresses on the screen -\u2013\nmany of them didn\u2019t even get close.\nThe one who did it brilliantly in the\nrecent film was Meryl Streep, who was\nstunning. I mean she was so accurate!\nI looked at her, I completely forgot\nthat she was Meryl Streep, and I just\nsaw Margaret Thatcher.\nHow truthful was that portrayal?\nWell it wasn\u2019t truthful, it was a\npiece of drama and people don\u2019t\nunderstand these things. They think\nthat a film about Margaret Thatcher\nmust be a documentary. It can\u2019t be\na documentary, it\u2019s not going to be a\ndocumentary. This was a dramatic\nportrayal of somebody, an elderly\nHouse of Cards from the House of Lords\nDiana Lucaci and Alexander Morton talk to Lord Dobbs, creator of the House of Cards series\nNETFLIX\n\n"

Of these the one I probably\nfelt most guilty about not checking\nout was Jack Vance. After all, he\nwas a Science Fiction and Fantasy\nWriters of America Grand Master\nand has been cited as an influence\nby a number of my favourite writers,\nincluding Neil Gaiman and Gene\nWolfe. Therefore, having found\nmyself with a little spare time a few\nmonths back, I decided to check out\none of his most notable works \u2013 the\nepic Tales of the Dying Earth series.\nA set of four books published\nbetween 1950 and 1984, Vance\u2019s Tales\nof the Dying Earth series is set far in\nthe future, with the sun beginning\nto grow cold and humanity resigned\nto its inevitable doom. Over the\nmillennia, science has given way to,\nor become indistinguishable from,\nmagic. Wizards are a commonplace\nsight and dangerous fantastical\ncreatures roam the desolate wastes\nof Earth.\nEach book is made up of a number\nof more or less interconnected\nstories. In the first book, The Dying\nEarth, the stories paint a broad\npicture of Vance\u2019s world. He clearly\nhad an impressive imagination,\nwhich is on full show in these stories\n\u2013 the dying Earth is a vibrant yet\nmysterious place with a unique\nfeel. Vance was also a highly skilled\nwriter technically. His descriptions\ncould almost be called beautiful\nand, while his characters are often\nunderdeveloped and even clich\u00e9d,\ntheir dialogue is sparkling with wit.\nI would stop short of calling it a\nbrilliant work but there is much to\ncommend it.\nUnfortunately, however, the sequels\ndo not share the charm of The Dying\nEarth. The other three books have\nmore of an overarching story but this\nchange, rather than allowing Vance\nto introduce more depth, works to\nshow off his flaws as a writer. While\non a technical level the prose is\nstill above average, the novelty of\nVance\u2019s world quickly fades. The plot\nfeels dry, tired and almost painfully\nrepetitive \u2013 the second book, Eyes\nof the Overworld, and third, Cugel\u2019s\nSaga, in particular have almost the\nsame story.\nThe failures in characterization are\nalready evident in The Dying Earth\nare enhanced by having to follow the\nsame characters through an entire\nbook rather than just one short\nstory. What is particularly annoying\nis that almost all of the characters\nare deeply unlikeable. Vance tries to\nportray many of them as charming\nrogues but, without proper character\ndevelopment, their behavior just\nseems objectionable.\nI can see why this series inspired\nand captured the imagination of so\nmany writers. Vance was certainly\nan innovator and his work does\nshow a lot of promise. Since Tales of\nthe Dying Earth was published the\nconcept has been executed far better\nby other works, say Gene Wolfe\nin his Book of the New Sun. People\ninterested in the history of science\nfiction and fantasy should certainly\ncheck it out but I doubt that it would\nhave much appeal to others.\nThe Dying Earth\n\u201cVance clearly had\nan impressive im-agination, which\nis on full show in\nthese stories.\u201d\n\u201cThe novelty of\nthe world quickly fades. The plot\nfeels dry tired and\nalmost painfully\nrepetative.\u201d\nWant to see your name in print?\nSend your book reviews to books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

The\ncompetition is open primarily to\namateurs and aims to encourage more\npeople to develop the skills necessary\nto join the computer security industry\nin the face of increasing threats to our\ncomputer networks.\nSpeaking to Felix Luke expressed\nhis belief that \u201ccyber-security is\nvery important \u2013 computing is an\nunavoidable part of our everyday lives\nnow, and it\u2019s down to everyone to play\ntheir part in keeping data secure\u201d.\nHowever, the general public remains\nwidely ignorant of how important it is.\n\u201cMore than a few data breaches,\u201d Luke\nadded, \u201ccould\u2019ve been avoided if the\nsame old advice had been followed:\ndon\u2019t click links in emails (especially\n\u2018your account has been locked\u2019 or\n\u2018your password has been changed\u2019);\ndon\u2019t download attachments you\nweren\u2019t expecting or from people\nyou don\u2019t recognise; run up-to-date\nantivirus software.\u201d\nThe lack of prominence of the field\nhas resulted in a chronic shortage\nof people wanting to work in the\ncyber security. While Luke first got\ninterested in computing as a result\nof family connections many other\npeople who would thrive in the area\nsimply do not realise that they have\nthe abilities to do so. Speaking to\nWired magazine the Challenge CEO,\nStephanie Damen, said: \u201cThere are a\nlot of people out there with the skills,\nbut for a lot of reasons, partly because\nwe didn\u2019t teach it in schools, partly\nbecause they\u2019re unaware of the talent,\nit\u2019s hidden talent. We know there\u2019s\ntalent, the problem is finding it.\u201d\nThe aim of the Challenge is to bring\nout this talent and put those who\nhave it in touch with those who can\nhelp them develop it further. Luke,\nin particular, believes that \u201cit\u2019s a great\nway to meet people with a similar\ninterest, as well as to learn more about\nthe policy side of things, and talk to\nsponsors in the industry about what\nit\u2019s like to work in cyber-security\u201d.\nThe Challenge presents a diverse\nrange of tasks to the competitors.\nLuke says: \u201cThere are three rounds to\nthe main competition \u2013 first a virtual\nround, that\u2019s entirely online. If you\nmanage to get through that, then\nthere\u2019s a face-to-face round, which is\nslightly more exciting. Passing that\ngets you through to the Msterclass,\nwhich is the most thrilling part.\nUsually the Masterclass is in teams\nmade up of people who qualified from\ndifferent \u2018streams; \u2018i.e. different face-to-face rounds) to make sure there\u2019s a\ndiverse range of skill sets available in\neach team.\nThe best part is almost certainly\nthe networking opportunities\nthe Challenge provides - they\u2019re\nunparalleled and a great way to talk\nto sponsors! The prizes are good too,\nthough - training courses and exams\nthat would cost far too much for me\nto afford on my own. The Masterclass\ncompetition itself was also really\namazing \u2013 a simulated scenario of a\ncyber-attack on Britain which had all\nsorts of different aspects\u2013 network\ntraffic analysis, speaking to the press\nand a mock board, writing up reports\n(both technical and non-technical),\nreverse engineering malware, creating\ncleanup solutions for malware and\npenetration testing.\u201d\nThe competition\u2019s organisers hope\nthat the Cyber Security Challenge\nencourages more people to pursue\nwork in this field. As Luke says: \u201cit\u2019s a\nbig world out there and attackers are\nonly getting smarter and a wider range\nof potential adversaries are appearing:\nwe need better and better ways to\nprotect ourselves.\u201d\nImperial Student Success in\nCyber Security Challenge\nMaciej Matuszewski\nNews Editor\nquestions are directly answered, with\nGeorgiadisdivertingtheconversation\nto a discussion about democracy\nor the ethos of the audience,\nand its political background,\noften dismissing participants of\nthe discussion as communists.\nBrief moments of discussion are\ninterrupted by commotion during\nwhich the Minister and the audience\nexchange insults.\nNotable remarks and questions\nfrom the audience include the finds\ndiscussed in papers in The Lancet,\na peer reviewed medical journal,\nwhich the Prime Minister dismisses\nas \u201cOpinions not Facts\u201d, in particularl\npointing out that the suicide and\nvaccination numbers they cite are\nwrong. He also compares the Greek\ncrisis to the 1945-6 British crisis\nthat led to the creation of the NHS\n\u2013 a remark which is unfortunately\ncoupled with a comment on illegal\nimmigrants. Asked about suggestions\nto allow greater freedom of drug sales\nat lower prices by opening up the\npharmacist profession, the Health\nMinister replies that such a policy\ncannot be implemented in Greece\nas the country has one of the highest\nnumbers of pharmacies per capita.\nHe says such measures would result\nin half of them going out of business.\nHe is then asked about the incident\nsurrounding the drowning of\nmigrants off the coast of Farmakonisi\nand his statements on it in Greek\nparliament. Georgiadis is specifically\nasked what is the value of a human\nlife \u2013 is the life of an immigrant less\nvaluable than that of a Greek national\nand whether that will be mirrored\nin his reforms. The Minister makes\nsome comments on immigration and\ntalks about how Greece has hit its\nlimit, as well as accusing the inquirer\nof sneakily taking his statements\nout of context. However, the\nconversation is swiftly derailed, with\nthe Minister eventually calling the\ncrowd communist and commenting\non Stalin\u2019s policies.\nWhen a doctor from the audience\naccuses him of being the first\nHealth Minister in history to target\nparticular ethnic groups, as well\nas criticising the government for\ndisregarding scientific facts and\nproducing a climate of fear of\ncensorship among the academic\ncommunity, the conversation is\nderailed into an argument over\nsemantics of what is a fact and what\nis an opinion. Regarding measures\nto tackle the humanitarian crisis in\nGreece, all the Minister states is that\nhe is awaiting studies and data to find\na solution and that hew will propose\nmeasures by June.\nThe discussion is nearing its\nend. Throughout, there have been\neruptions of commotion. Even the\npanelists seem to have lost their\npatience, not only with the audience\nbut also with the Minister \u2013 who is\nengaging in a game of verbal tag and\nseems to try his best to challenge the\ncrowd. When a young man makes a\ncomment on the Health Minister\u2019s\nEnglish, Georgiadis starts shouting\n\u201cYou are racist! You are racist! You are\na fascist!\u201d \u2013 apparently in mockery of\nhis opposers in the audience.\nThe last person from the audience\nto speak is the young woman that was\ninvited to speak up first. She proceeds\nto talk about her personal experience\nwith a young girl with HIV in the\nKoridalos prison in Athens. She\ncriticises the reintroduction of the\nregulation that requires mandatory\nSTI testing of socially vulnerable\ngroups such as sex workers, drug\nusers and illegal immigrants. She\ngets emotional half way through. The\nHealth Minister, outraged, attacks\nher for showing emotion and accuses\nher of manipulating the crowd: \u201cLike\nyou\u2019re the only (one that\u2019s) human!\nYou should be ashamed! You\u2019re the\nmonster\u201d.\nThe Discussion is closed after this.\nThe crowd has been getting smaller\nthroughout the event and with this\noutburst a large part of the crowd\ngets up and leaves. In the front, the\nsupporters of the Health Minister are\napplauding him. Georgiadis delivers\nhis closing speech. It carries some of\nthe most absurd statements I have\nheard all night: \u201cThese people are in\nour universities, they\u2019re everywhere,\nthey speak of democracy but don\u2019t\nlet anyone that disagrees speak\u2026We\nhave to show them that we are not\nafraid of them. We are not afraid of\nthem. We represent the free world\n\u2026 They make up the tyranny of the\nworld\u2026 \u201d He goes on to talk about\nthe difficulty of being a politician\nin Greece, \u201c\u2026You have to be proud\nof these politicians that have the\ncourage to stand up to the people\u201d\nand reverts to attacking the ethos\nof the crowd that opposed him \u201c\u2026\nWhenever they [communists] took\npower they killed millions of people\n\u2026 they will see all the people in\nGreece die but for them this will be\nnothing, because they will watch the\nTV and eat their burger \u2026 You did\nnot let us do this conversation and\nthis is fascism \u2026 Today\u2019s event was a\ngreat event \u2026 The Greek politicians\nare not doing things they\u2019ve ashamed\nof \u2026 We will not let our country fall\nbecause some communists want to.\u201d\nIndeed the whole event was a\ngreat success for Georgiadis. He\nsuccessfully evaded important\nquestions on future reforms of the\nHealth System by manipulating\nand challenging the audience into a\nverbal fight.\nIronically he kept going on about\ndemocracy, how the people had\nelected him, how he represents the\nwill of the people and how opposing\nhim meant opposing them. He kept\nrepeating the same argument and I\nhave to say, it got me thinking. We\ndid vote for him. Democracy did\nget him where he is. Is not a system\nthat results in such people acquiring\npolitical power flawed? Is this a result\nof the tyranny of the majority? Or is\nit just a mind game that politicians\nplay with us to make us believe that\nyes, democracy is indeed flawed,\nwhen in fact what we have is not\ndemocracy. Perhaps it is the coupling\nof democracy with capitalism that is\nproblematic, I don\u2019t know. All I know\nis that we need change.\nGCHQ\n\n"

    "content": "12 FRIDAY 21 MAR\nCOMMENT\nEditors: Eoghan J.\nTotten, Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nI\nt used to be that the world was\nan absolutely awful place. People\nwere starving left and right in all\nthose countries to the South, the\nhole in the ozone layer was going\nto kill us all, there was no more oil left,\ngrubby foreigners were going to steal\nall of our jobs, and the latest Star Wars\nmovie was the biggest tragedy of our\ngeneration.\nNo matter which media outlet you\nchecked, bad news piled up higher\nthan the corpses of all the various\nspecies we were forcing into early\nextinction for fun. Every day there was\na new crisis that threatened to destroy\nus: GMOs, the Y2K bug, El Ni\u00f1o,\nyou name it, we were on the verge of\nglobal catastrophe RIGHT NOW, and\nNOTHING would be spared.\nWhile it was perhaps a ploy to sell\nmore copies of magazines or whatever\npaper contraption people used to get\ntheir news in the pre-internet days, it\nwas actually a rather inspiring state of\naffairs.\nThe world was in bad shape, and\nthere was a mighty need for someone\nto fix it. So much was wrong that\nevery kid could grow up to be a hero.\nYou could discover the next miracle\ndrug and cure AIDS once and forever,\nor you could help save the rainforest,\nor you could bring books to crippled\norphans in the Middle East. Did you\nprefer the beach? The Great Coral\nReef needed a hand. Like the animals?\nPandas have trouble getting it on.\nMore of a people person? Gays aren\u2019t\ngoing to stop being persecuted by\nthemselves, you know.\nEverywhere you turned, the world\nwas in dire need of someone to\nsave it and bring justice, peace and\nprosperity. As we were told that we\nwere special little snowflakes, and that\nin each of us there was the potential\nfor great things, we were presented\nwith a list of dramatic problems that\nneeded fixing. Each of us was a Harry\nPotter that would save the world, the\nlast hope sent back in time to save us\nall, the chosen one to save humanity,\nthe saviour that had to save, save, save,\neverything needed to be saved by the\nimpending doom. Starving children,\noppressed minorities, failing crops,\ndwindling resources, there always\nsomeone or something that was just\nwaiting for a great hero.\nBut at some point the world stopped\nbeing the trailer for a disaster movie.\nThe media never really took notice,\nbut reality did. More or less naturally,\nthings have gotten better. Nearly every\nstatistic used to measure our decline\nshows that we\u2019re really headed in the\nright direction: the number of people\nliving in extreme poverty has gone\ndown, literacy rates are up, we\u2019re\nliving in the most peaceful time in\nhistory, and all of it without a messiah\nto rise and ordain it.\nThe date for when we finally run out\nof oil is being pushed back and back,\nand we may actually wrap our heads\naround these newfangled \u201crenewable\nresources\u201d. After decades of violent\nrhetoric, Iran\u2019s new president seems\nlike an ok guy, and even the head\nof the Catholic Church, one of the\nmost reactionary organisations in\nhistory, is turning out to be a decent,\nopen-minded person; in both cases\nit is more of a natural consequence\nof the gradual change for the better\nrather than a sudden dramatic shift in\nmentality. All in all, things are looking\nup.\nDon\u2019t mistake this for complacence.\nNot everything is good yet, and\nthere\u2019s a lot that needs to be done still;\nbut the situation was dramatically\nmisrepresented, and, even worse,\nthere\u2019s no more need for a single\nGreat Man\u2122 (or Great Woman\u2122) to fix\nit. The age of the individual is fading\nfast, and now more than ever it is\ncollective, small efforts that are going\nto make our problems go away, not the\nactions of the single. There\u2019s a reason\nwhy the gay rights movement exists\nand is healthy, but doesn\u2019t have the\nequivalent of a Rosa Parks or a Martin\nLuther King Jr.: we\u2019ve outgrown the\nneed for an individual to inspire\nus and lead us, and instead rely on\neveryone\u2019s contributions.\nThis is all well and good but\nunfortunately it means that standing\nout is next to impossible.\nSome of us wanted to end world\nhunger by creating a giant tomato,\ndammit, and instead it\u2019s going to be\na slow but constant process of more\nefficient food production, less waste\nand better management.\nSure, there\u2019s bigots and homophobes\nand racists in power, but they die and\nare replaced by more tolerant leaders.\nFifty years ago they fought interracial\nmarriages and, having lost that battle,\ntoday they have to fight gay marriages:\neventually, things will get better.\nThe last thing that megalomaniacs\nhave got going for them is hoping that\nthe new Star Wars movie is awful and\noverfilled with lens flare. Maybe there\nwill be a need for a messiah there, to\nbring to the franchise the salvation it\nneeds.\nThis universe scarcely needs a\nsaviour, but perhaps the Expanded\none does.\nTell me it\u2019s O-Kaye\nT\nhe most controversial\nof next year\u2019s sabbatical\nofficers is, no doubt, Chris\nKaye. In an online media\noutlet that may never be\nnamed within these pages, we are told\nthat the incoming Deputy President\n(Welfare) ran on a platform of a scaled\nback and cost-effective union, merging\nthe positions of Deputy President\n(Welfare) and Deputy President\n(Education), and has a mandate from\nstudents to roll the union back.\nThis claim is at best mistaken and\nat worst disingenuous: Mr Kaye\u2019s\nmanifesto promised donations to the\nscholarship fund, a vote on whether\nsabbatical officers should become\nhonorary life members of the Union,\nand pressure on college to reform\ndraconian coursework rules. These\nare all very worthy policies, but Chris\u2019\nbig point about reducing the number\nof sabbatical officers was nowhere to\nbe seen on his manifesto, and was not\ninformation that was readily available\nto voters.\nIn fact, it took cross-examination on\nSTOIC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Candidates\u201d show\nfor the real story to come out. After\na perplexing chain of reasoning that\nstarted with pub chat with an alumnus\nwho had a good time at Imperial back\nwhen there was only one sabbatical\nofficer, Chris Kaye told viewers that\nhe intended to get rid of the Deputy\nPresident (Welfare).\nNow, it was never clear why Mr\nKaye becoming DP(W) would be the\nmost effective way to achieve this; as\nhe himself pointed out, any Imperial\nstudent can bring a paper to council.\nWhat is even less clear is why someone who doesn\u2019t think a job should exist is the person that should be doing\nthat job. How does Mr Kaye have any\nincentive to expand and improve the\nwelfare offerings of the Union, when\nhe himself thinks that students should\ntake their problems to the college instead because it is better run than the\nUnion?Meanwhile, the problems that\nstudents at Imperial really face every\nday continue. We still see extremely\nhigh levels of stress and low levels of\nsatisfaction among students, we have\nbig problems with mental health and\nsexual assault: Mr Kaye\u2019s response is\nto suggest that we need less rather\nthan more attention focused on the\npressing welfare issues that we face.\nThis brings to mind his campaign for\nGender Equality Officer, running on\nthe platform of \u201cthis position does not\nneed to exist.\u201d\nWe have been told recently in an online tabloid (the name of which I cannot remember) that Mr Kaye\u2019s election as Deputy President (Welfare)\nwill prompt debate and allow students\nto evaluate what their Union should\nbe doing for them. This is true in the\nsame way that telling the police to not\nturn up for work might show us how\nmuch we rely on the enforcement of\nlaws for public safety.\nThere is a vulgar saying that goes\nsomething like, \u201cit\u2019s better for one to\nbe on the inside of the tent pissing out\nthan on the outside pissing in.\u201d Mr\nKaye, through his (often admirable)\ndissent in Union Council has shown\nthat he was never afraid to attack the\nUnion, but now he is very much in-side, we have to make sure he does not\ntry to piss all over us.\nNick Farmer\nWriter\nOh, what\u2019s wrong with the world today?\nPietro Aronica\nWriter\n\n"

A pinprick of light. The noise intensifies,\nthe light grows. More. More. The\nlight spills out, begin to refract. Colours seep through. The noise becomes\ndeeply, deeply unsettling. And sud-denly: title cards. And Scotland.\nUnder the Skin\u2019s opening few minutes are almost the film in miniature.\nThe visuals move from a mixture of\ndarkness and blinding light via the\ngloomy, ominous Scottish countryside to weird spaces that aren\u2019t spaces*\nwhere Scarlett Johansson\u2019s alien intimately interacts with members of the\nhuman race. There\u2019s disconcertingly\nnonsexual nudity, and an inescapable feeling of something being \u2018off\u2019.\nThere\u2019s a mysterious Biker figure who\nis almost terrifying in how ruthless\nyet unexplained he appears, aiding the\nalien without ever directly engaging\nwith her (beyond a lengthy stare).\nAnd the score. Oh, the score. Johansson may be the star on the poster,\nbut it\u2019s the sound that truly steals the\nshow here. Levi\u2019s score never gives\nyou a moment to recover, continually\nsubjecting you to discomfort, always\nadding to what\u2019s on screen.\nTo all intents and purposes, the film\ncontinues with those points. But as it\nprogresses, as the alien explores our\nworld, it becomes something more.\nThe early scenes of Johansson moving unnoticed among crowds are both\ntroubling and brilliant, forcing a re-ex-amination of everyday life. The sound\nediting skews everything, the cinematography leaves everything feeling\noff-kilter, and it works. It works so, so\nwell. A shopping centre is almost terrifying in its unrelenting aural assault.\nThe motorways fade into blurs of\nmoving lights. Vast, sprawling estates\nbecome claustrophobic, threatening.\nAnd all this comes together in one\nstand-out scene, as the alien stands\nand impassively watches a mother and\nfather drown at the beach, leaving behind a tiny child. A fellow bystander\ndives in to try and save the father, and\nstill the alien watches, unfeeling, as he\nis thrown ashore gasping and weak-ened. And only then does she inter-vene. It\u2019s a horrifyingly, masterfully\nshot scene, with a full awareness of\nthe cinematic language that leaves us\nwatching the action at a remove with\nthe alien, all long shots and muted\nsound. Only the waves truly crash\nthrough to us.\nI\u2019m getting shudders just thinking\nabout it.\nI\u2019m not convinced I have enough\nwords in my vocabulary to accurately\n\u2013 fully \u2013 express how Under the Skin\nwill make you feel. I\u2019m throwing as\nmany synonyms for \u2018unsettling\u2019 as I\ncan find at it, and I\u2019m still short. This\nis an experience of a film, and it\u2019s one\nthat demands to be seen in the cinema\nto fully appreciate it for what it is. In\nthe dark, with Levi\u2019s score blasting\ninto your ears, it\u2019s incredible.\nAlien in Scotland\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel is a tricky\nfilm to review. Put quite simply: it\u2019s a\nWes Anderson film. In every conceivable way, as with all of his films before\nit, it is the essence of its predecessors\nmixed up, distilled, and delivered to\nthe silver screen in a blast of pure, sur-real, bittersweet joy. Each film learns\nfrom what came before, each film\nadds to one of the greatest directorial\ncatalogues around today. And Grand\nBudapest is no different. It has all the\ncharming elements that could be ex-pected, all the off-beat visuals and the\ndelightfully exaggerated backdrops,\nand now it introduces a healthy dose\nof black humour. A more than healthy\ndose, truth be told. Grand Budapest\nseems to positively revel in the stuff.\nAnd so what was meant to be a\nsimple statement \u2013 that this truly is a\nWes Anderson film, with all that that\nstatement entails \u2013 becomes mildly\ncomplicated and severely over-long.\nBut it is the truth. Fans of Anderson\u2019s\nprevious works \u2013 any of them, from\nthe early days of Rushmore to the animation of Fantastic Mr Fox \u2013 will find\nplenty to adore here. Fans of cinema,\nof films, will find plenty to engage\nwith (and then adore). With a cast\nthis star-studded, a cast so star-stud-ded it is quite possible the most star-studded cast to ever grace the screen,\nthere\u2019s no room, no chance, for bad\nacting. The writing is magnificent and\nas deliriously oddball as ever, and the\nmixture of (the ever-growing roster\nof) Anderson regulars (from Brody to\nWilson, and back again via Murray)\nand Anderson debutants proves nothing short of incredible.\nForemost among the debutants, and\nthe cast in general, is Ralph Fiennes,\nas the eponymous hotel\u2019s concierge,\nMonsieur Gustave H. Displaying deft\ncomic timing which he is (all to un-fortunately) rarely allowed to unleash\noutside the arena of this film, he is the\ncentrepiece around which the entirety\nof Grand Budapest \u2013 much like the\nhotel \u2013 revolves, and he more than\nrises to the occasion. Complete newcomer Tony Revolori proves himself\none to watch, completely nailing the\ntone, while Saoirse Ronan completes\nthe central trio as Agatha, proving\nimmensely watchable with minimal\nscreen time.\nMinimal screen time for excellent\nactors is perhaps the only criticism\nthat could really be levelled at Grand\nBudapest, but it\u2019s more of a complaint\nthan a criticism, and indulging it\nwould only spoil the film.\nWorthy of mention is the multiple framing narratives employed by\nthe film; this is, for want of a more\nconcise explanation, a story within\na story, within a story within a story.\nThe layers work in symmetry, each\nlayer book-ending the one that follows (with a few cuts between the innermost two). Spreading the reach of\nthe story beyond the inter-war years,\nlending it an even greater scope, they\ncan almost feel a little superfluous,\nuntil realisation strikes. This is first\nand foremost the story of Monsieur\nGustave H, and that \u2013 that is the\npoint. It\u2019s a story. Both blissfully innocent and bitingly self-aware. This is\nself-examination as film-making, and\nit\u2019s simultaneously blindingly obvious\nand exceedingly subtle.\nThe Author and Mr Moustafa (the\ntwo narrators) at the film\u2019s close, discuss M. Gustave. The age to which he\nbelonged was gone before he could\nenter it, they say, but he \u201csustained\nthe illusion with a marvellous grace.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s so very difficult to be sure\nthey don\u2019t mean Anderson himself.\nSustaining the illusion of these worlds\nhe creates with a marvellous grace. It\u2019s\nalmost a perfect description.\nThe Grand Budapest\nHotel\nDirector: Wes Anderson\nWriters: Wes Anderson, Hugo\nGuinness, Stefan Zweig (inspired by\nthe works of)\nStarring: Ralph Fiennes, F.

England, with aspirations of\na home Rugby World Cup success\nin 2015, should have won a Grand\nSlam. The vast majority of knockout\nmatches in the RWC are tight games,\nso you have to be comfortable closing\nthem out. Some really impressive\nperformances besides the France\ngame leave them very much on the\nway up.\nIRELAND\nWhat is it with Ireland and new\ncoaches? A really strong Six Nations\nculminated in an intensely stressful\nfinal match (for everyone who isn\u2019t\nScotland or Italy). Schmidt might not\nquite have brought \u2018Leinstertainment\u2019\nto the team just yet, but they\nlooked very good throughout the\ntournament. Their power game in the\nmauls destroyed Wales, and ultimately\nprovided the points difference that\nwon the title.\nSCOTLAND\nTo put it bluntly this was a terrible\ntournament for Scotland, a one-point win against Italy was one of a\nfew high points. Could and perhaps\nshould have beaten France on the\nday, but sport is judged on absolutes.\nHopefully the arrival of Vern Cotter\nwill provide them with some fresh\nimpetus, though Scott Johnson has\ndone little to show why he should be\nDirector of Rugby. It\u2019s hard to take\ntoo much from the final game, since\nthe loss of a fullback that early is an\nimpossible position.\nFRANCE\nA fairly bad year for France; the team\nnever seemed to gel and we didn\u2019t see\nanywhere near enough flair. Their\nwins against England and Scotland\ncould quite easily have gone the\nother way, and Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9\nneeds to take a deep look at his team.\nThe attempt to blood Jules Plisson\nwas admirable, and it was certainly\ninteresting to see France pick a fly-half at 10, but it never took off for the\nyoung Parisian. Despite this they were\nstill in contention, and could continue\nto spring surprises at the RWC.\nITALY\nWhile this was the worst Six Nations\nfor Italy in a good few years there\nwere a lot of promising signs. Michele\nCampagnaro seems quite an exciting\nyoung player in the centres, and I\nfully expect a number of teams to be\nsounding him out for a potential move\nthis summer. The old stereotype that\nwhen Parisse doesn\u2019t perform neither\ndo Italy is sadly still true, and with\ntheir captain out of sorts for the whole\ntournament the Italians lacked their\nsupply of gain line busting runs. After\na few years of punching above their\nweight Italy face a bit of a rebuilding\nphase, but with the quality of young\nplayers they have coming through\nthere\u2019s real hope for the future.\nWALES\nIt\u2019s hard to get a real judge on Wales\nthis year, they seem to have lost their\nedge from previous years, with the\nspikiness of Mike Phillips going past\nan acceptable point. Wales still have a\nteam with some fantastic players, but\nit feels like the end of an era. Warren\nGatland needs to look at blooding\nsome younger players; otherwise\nWales could well be a long way behind\nEngland and Australia in their RWC\npool.\nBBC\n\n"

    "content": "30 FRIDAY 21 MAR\nFILM Editor: John Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSun, Sex and Slavery\nIt\u2019s amazing how things happen and\ntime passes without you realising it.\nFor some of you reading this, the upcoming Spring All-Nighter could very\nwell be your last. This could be your\nfinal chance to sit in a crowded room\nand spend an evening, a night and\npart of a morning watching some of\nthe best films that the last few months\nhave had to offer. To those I say, what\nare you waiting for? This is something\nthat you will not be able to experience\nfor the rest of your life while you slog\naway in a lab (or in an office if you\nsell out). Make sure you buy a ticket,\ngrab some friends and make your way\nto the second floor of the Union. To\nthose who aren\u2019t in their final year, I\nsay pretty much the same thing. If\nyou\u2019ve been before, then make it a tra-dition. If you haven\u2019t, then you might\nas well come and give it a try.\nAs an innocent Fresher I attended\nmy first All-Nighter as a punter. Over\nexcited as always, I spend the preceding days trying to convince my friends\nin halls to come with me. And I can\nsay without slanting the truth or hyperbole that that was the best and\nmost bizarre evening in the entirety of\nmy first term of Imperial. Sleep deprivation makes for both strange conversations and strange actions. Seven\nsugars in a cup of tea? Easy. Quadruple layered brown sauce sandwich?\nNo problem. A failure to understand\nthe plot of some films leading to convoluted conversations on the subject\nwith complete strangers? Of course.\nA massive grin on my face for the rest\nof the next day? Even 9am lectures\ncouldn\u2019t get rid of it.\nNow, I\u2019m about to go to my fourth\nAll-Nighter, this time as a cynical second year and somehow the incoming\nchair of Imperial Cinema, and I am\nmore excited than ever before. We\u2019ve\ngot five fantastic films that boast a\nridiculous thirty Oscar nominations\nbetween them, more tins of hot dogs\nthan you can shake a stick at and\nenough hot beverages to fill a fairly\nsmall ocean.\n1) Our first film of the evening, boasting only a pitiful three Oscars to its\nname, is Dallas Buyers Club. Set in\nthe earliest days of the HIV epidemic,\nthe film follows the true story of Ron\nWoodroof, a man diagnosed with\nAIDS and given 30 days to live. After\nbeing ostracized by family and friends,\nRon takes medicinal matters into his\nown hands, smuggling in unapproved\ndrugs from all across the world and\ndistributing them to other sufferers\nthrough the eponymous buyers club.\nFeaturing remarkable acting, with\nOscar wins for both Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto, this film truly\nis the start of what critics have dubbed\n\u2018The McConaissance\u2019.\n2) Next up we\u2019ve got another true\nstory and another Oscar-bait favourite topic, this time slavery. As intense\nas it is harrowing, at times 12 Years A\nSlave can be hard to watch. You\u2019ll be\nglad you did though; this certainly is\nnot a film to be missed. When Solomon Northup is tricked into slavery\nhe must endure years of beatings\nand betrayal as he learns to rely only\nin himself in his bid to once again be\nfree. This is the Schindler\u2019s List of slavery films, bold, brutal, and fully deserving of its best picture win.\nEllen Mathieson\nImperial Cinema\n\n"

    "content": "33\nFRIDAY 21 MAR\nFOOD\nEditor: Carol Ann Cheah,\nMichael Yat Kit Chung\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBored of your meals?\nFelix Food is here with tips to avoid being in a food rut\nAs students, our food budgets might be limited, but this does not mean our diets are boring! Eating out or ordering takeaway is neither cheap nor healthy most of\nthe time, but not only can you control the cost and what goes into your food when you cook yourself, we guarantee you will find it enjoyable and an easy (and\ntasteful) way to de-stress! Both of us, your food editors at Felix, cook regularly; here is how we avoid being in a food rut \u2013 i.e. eating the same food every day.\nMICHAEL YAT KIT CHUNG\nThe risotto with chicken, leek and mushrooms,\nwith added bacon and frozen vegetables!\nPersonally I did not start cooking until coming\nto university a few years back and as a passionate\n\u2018foodie\u2019 who can be described as skint, I thought\nitwouldbeagreatpointtostartlearningtocook.\nFor me, the number one step to avoid being in\na food rut is keep your cupboard stocked. From\ntinned tomatoes to stock cubes, from dry herbs\nto pasta \u2013 if you have it ready to hand, you\ncan be a lot more creative about what you eat.\nFrom a young age, we were taught that\nnutritious meals have three main parts:\ncarbohydrates, protein, vegetables. This is what\nI base my evening meals on. Carbohydrates,\nsuch as rice and pasta, can easily be stored in\nthe cupboard, while vegetables and protein I get\nduring my weekly food shop. This might be the\nfirst time to say this, but frozen vegetables are\nveryversatilewhenitcomestobeingpartofyour\nfive a day \u2013 no chopping or washing required!\nSo for example: at the moment I have\nsome boneless chicken thighs, leek and\nmushrooms in the fridge from my weekend\nshop since they are on offer. And here are\na few example dishes you can make with\nthese ingredients as the \u2018core elements\u2019.\nSoup\nCut the chicken thighs into chunks, season\nand pan fry them with a little oil until browned.\nLeave them to rest to aside, we will add it at the\nend. Now with all the flavours from the chicken\nin the pan, melt a bit of butter, add an onion and\ntwo cloves of garlic and cook for a few minutes\nuntil softened. Then add a chopped potato, a\nchopped leek and the chopped mushrooms\ninto the pan and fry for around three minutes.\nAdd enough chicken stock to cover all the\ningredients and bring the mixture to the boil.\nThen reduce the heat and simmer for ten\nminutes, or until the vegetables are tender. At\nthis point, it is optional whether you want to\nmash the ingredients so you get a smoother\ntexture. Add the chicken back into the pan at low\nheat for a minute or so then stir in double cream\nto your liking and remove the pan from the heat.\nIf you are not a fan of soup, you can make\nthis into a sauce quite easily, just reduce the\namount of liquid you put into the pan! The\nsauce will go well with spaghetti, fusilli or\nindeed any kind of pasta, and if you are feeling\nhaving a bit of an Asian twist, serve it with rice!\nRisotto\nTime for the Italian spin. Heat a bit of butter\nand a tablespoon of oil in a saucepan over a\nmedium heat. Add an onion, a clove of garlic,\na leek and the mushroom, all chopped, and fry\nfor a minute, or until soft, then add seasoned\nchicken thighs chunk and cook until browned.\nTurn to low heat, then add 100g of risotto\nrice and pour 300ml of chicken stock bit by\nbit, and keep stirring. Keep it simmering\nuntil the stock is absorbed and the rice is\ncompletely cooked through when add the\nstock has been added. Season, to taste,\nwith salt and freshly ground black pepper.\nStir Fry\nIn my opinion, this is where Chinese cooking\nshows its best \u2013 the number of options you get\nin a stir fry is just phenomenal! In this recipe,\nI am going to use rice noodles as my carbs,\nbut equally you can use rice, other noodles,\nor even spaghetti for a more chewy texture!\nFirst of all, follow the instructions on the\npacketandsoftenthericenoodles.Heatupapan\nand add the oil and the so called \u2018Holy Trinity\u2019,\nchopped spring onions, garlic and ginger. Then\nadd the chopped leek and fry them until half\nsoftened,whenyouputthechoppedmushrooms\nand chicken thigh chunks into the mix.\nWhen all ingredients are mostly cooked,\nadd the rice noodles in and mix everything\nup so the rice noodles taste flavoursome\nwith all the juices from the meat and\nleeks. Then served it up! It\u2019s that easy!\nMichael Yat Kit Chung\nI\u2019m a moderately clinically depressed bunny.\nThere, I said it. Some of you may be able to\nsympathise; others will roll your eyes and\nwonder what this fact has to do with a food\ncolumn \u2013 you might accuse me of turning this\ninto a sympathy fest. Rest assured there\u2019s a\nreason for this!\nThelongandshortofitisthis:EVERYTHING.\nDiet\u2019s a major player in making or breaking your\nmood and energy, which affects productivity.\nI could go on about the science of different\nneurotransmitters et al. (which control your\nmood and energy) that are linked to diet; but\nthat\u2019s really not the point of this column.\nIn any case, I totally understand that some\ndays it\u2019s all so overwhelming \u2013 coursework, that\nannoying dude on the fourth floor of Central\nLibrary who can\u2019t keep his shoes on \u2013 and\nprepping a good meal is the last thing on your\nmind (more so when you have OC and Wasabi\nwithin sniffing distance). Do I have days where\nI don\u2019t eat as well as I should? You betcha; we\u2019re\nonly human. But in a high-stress environment\nlike Imperial, it\u2019s important to take care of\nyourself even when you\u2019re tooling hard. When\nI\u2019ve eaten properly, I definitely find that I\u2019m less\nachy and my concentration\u2019s better. Not perfect,\nbut it\u2019s a start. No warehouse of energy drinks\ncan substitute for a proper diet.\n\u201cBUT IT\u2019S SO HARD,\u201d you cry. Well if you\ncan derive equations till you\u2019re blue in the face,\nyou\u2019ll be happy to hear that preventing a food\nrut is way simpler \u2013 the hard part is the doing,\nbut plenty of tips exist to make it easier!\nCarol Ann Cheah\nFailure to prepare...\nForethought is your best friend when it\ncomes to breaking out of the food rut. You\u2019ll\nhave heard MANY student guidebooks and\nmoney-saving columns harp on how important\na shopping list/paper meal planning is; somehow\nby writing it out, you\u2019re more likely to stick to /\ncarry out your plans then you would if they only\nexisted in your head. You\u2019ll also start realising\nif you\u2019re repeatedly buying/cooking the same\nthings and know where to make tweaks.\nNow I\u2019m a sucker for Japanese bento-style\nmeals, and I use those as a bit of a springboard\nfor meal planning and portion control. When I\ncan, I think about what meals I want to have for\nthe week and what ingredients will go into those\nmeals \u2013 those go in my shopping list. Where\npossible I\u2019ll \u2018double up\u2019 meals so that leftover\ndinner one night can get incorporated into lunch\nthe next day, albeit with extra add-ons so that it\nwon\u2019t be exactly the same meal (which keeps\nit interesting). Say I\u2019ll have a stir-fry meat dish\nwith rice one night \u2013 I\u2019ll have it with couscous\nthe next day and different fruit for dessert.\nAfter a period of time working with plans/\nlists-on-paper, you find you\u2019ll get better at it.\nMy mum has a magical ability to buy the right\namount during the weekly shop \u2013 even sans list.\nTry Something New Today\nLest I sound like I\u2019m ripping off the Sainsbo\u2019s\ntagline, it\u2019s one way I inject a bit of fun into\nmy food and it makes me expand my culinary\nhorizons. I\u2019ll spare a weekend to have a quick\nlook at the aisles and do a bit of \u2018New Ingredient\nRoulette\u2019 \u2013 I\u2019ll pick a vegetable /seasoning that\nI have minimal experience/knowledge of, then\ntry and incorporate that ingredient into my\ncooking, whether it\u2019s by Googling a new recipe,\nor just going freestyle. (Eek!)\nThrough this I\u2019ve discovered I quite dig cooked\nbeetroot (especially in a salad). In a milder\nversion of Ingredient Roulette, my housemate\nhas discovered that he actually doesn\u2019t mind\nanchovies after all... but only if they\u2019re broken\ndown in pasta puttanesca sauce, not if they\u2019re\nwhole. Bit too adventurous? Start small by\nmaking a single ingredient tweak in one of your\nfavourite recipes (say swap peas in your fried rice\nfor chopped French beans), rather than basing a\nwhole recipe around your single new ingredient.\nKeep It Simple, Silly\nOne of the ways to absolutely hate cooking\nis to make it more complex than it really is.\nYou don\u2019t need to sous-vide the hell out of your\ngrub to have a decent meal; neither do you need\n42 courses for interest. The key is in picking\nstuff that is either so quick it only needs minutes\non the hob, or stuff that needs a bit more time\nbut is \u2018set and forget\u2019 \u2013 like say, something that\nneeds a slow roast (let the oven do all the work),\nor a simmer for at least 30 minutes. Oftentimes\nI\u2019ll just bung a pork belly joint (with a bit of\nseasoning) into the oven to let roast, set the timer,\nand have my revision to hand while I wait for it\nto be ready. On the other end of the spectrum,\nI tap back into my Asian roots and let a quick\nstir-fry take care of my vegetables. Because the\nveggies are cooked quickly over high heat, you\nsave as many of the good nutrients as possible.\n\n"

The 2\u2019s\nVarsity netball match has been closely\ncontested for the past two years with\nboth sides having one win and one\nloss under their belts. As the big day\napproached we talked about dreams\nand nightmares centred around our\nmedic rivals. Some may say we were\nobsessed. We had always known that\nIC 2s, who had been disgustingly\nlabelled as Imperial 4th in BUCS due\nto the merge with the medics, should\ninstead be Imperial 3rds; but knew\nwe\u2019d have to take the higher ground\nand prove, once and for all, that we\ndid deserve to be above the medics.\nMarch 12th was the day where we\ncould prove our worth, and that\u2019s just\nwhat we did\u2026\nThe night before Varsity, IC 2s\nbonded while decorating 110 cupcakes\nand the team shovelled in the carbs via\nmounds of pasta and raw cake mix. As\nthe next morning came and went, IC\n2s were gradually losing their voices\ndue to the tense matches prior to the\n2s (congrats IC 3s!). To save our much\nneeded vocals, we ventured onto\nPrinces Gardens to take in some fresh\nair, warm up and calm our nerves\nunder the sun. Some last minute\ntactics and a pre-game pep talk in the\nEthos foyer and before we knew it, we\nwere on court and ready for the first\nwhistle. Little did we know that our\ndreams were about to be turned to\nreality and nightmares forgotten!\nWith nerves to blame, the first\nquarter was drenched with silly\nmistakes for IC and a lack of\ncommunication on court, finishing 8-3\nto the medics. With the familiarity of\noften finding ourselves behind early on\nin matches, we were unphased by the\nscore line and regrouped. IC needed\nto talk to each other and do what we\nhad done so well in our past games:\nshower each other with compliments.\nA particular favourite of the team has\nalways been \u201cnice arms\u201d and there was\nno shortage of those two little words\nin the rest of the game.\nClearly IC 2s love the compliments,\nand quick turnovers at the start of\nthe second quarter ensured we took\nan early lead. Rachael Collins made\nincredible interceptions, coming out\nof nowhere to take the ball right out\nof medic hands (sometimes literally)\nwhilst the entire team were able to\nwork it down the court with a sense of\nserenity. Izzy McLachlan and Harriet\nRumgay worked it around the D and\ninto the net seamlessly, ignoring the\ncopious amounts of contact not being\nblown up; this calm approach to IC\u2019s\ngame put us ahead and with four\nminutes to go in the 2nd quarter the\nscore was 13-10.\nFeeling a lot more positive about\nthe match, IC 2s still needed to be at\ntheir best. Knowing that they\u2019d been\ncomfortably leading at this point last\nyear and went on to lose (only just!),\nthe 2s knew the medics would come\nback fighting. IC fought for every ball\nand did so harder than the medics.\nOur rivals got increasingly frustrated\nwith themselves and at IC\u2019s beloved\numpire, Pat, causing play to be\nadvanced to the centre circle from our\ndefensive third, and within five passes\nanother turnover for IC resulted.\n\u201cNice arms\u201d from both shooters and\nEmily Rolfe meant IC intercepted\npasses like there was no tomorrow,\nwhilst at the other end, Toni\nSemmence and Emma Dixon were\nwinning many rebounds and making\nnumerous interceptions. Shouts of\n\u201cBASELINE, BASELINE\u201d could still\nbe heard over the crowd at the other\nend of the court. Often considered the\n\u2018safe\u2019 pass out to players on the edge\nof the D will no longer be seen in the\nsame light as Rachael consistently\nleapt into the air, tipping the ball out\nof the court, without touching a single\nmedic in sight.\nHaving extended our lead\nconsiderably in the 3rd quarter to\n32-16, our positivity was at an all-time high and the compliments were\nunstoppable. This was our game to\nlose. But that was never going to\nhappen\u2026\nLike a great white we were released\ninto our ocean, the last quarter, where\nwe were free to tear our victims apart\nCollege 2s beat Medics 42-35 in tense\nand close encounter\nwith every turnover. Screams howled\nfrom the medic spectators while IC\nkept up their great work and beautiful,\nbeautiful arms. With even stronger\npasses from the IC attacking end and\nincreased frustration by the medic\ndefence, Pat continued to stand her\nground. Someone should\u2019ve told the\nmedics that nobody talks back to Pat\nbut she gently let them know that she,\nindeed, was the umpire. Better late\nthan never!\nA slightly dodgy baseline pass from\nSarah Simmonds which bounced off\nthe rim of the goal post was ripped\nfrom medic hands by Harriet Rumgay\nand summed up the whole afternoon\u2019s\naffair; IC will give false hope to those\nweak enough to get carried away, and\nthen snatch it out of their hands in\nbroad daylight (or in this case, under\nthe bright lights of Ethos). It was\ndestined to be the biggest win IC has\nhad over the medics in a very long\ntime, and that\u2019s just what it ended up\nbeing. The final score of the match\nwas 42-35 and player of the match\nwas awarded to Harriet Rumgay for\nher shooting and rebounds (as well\nas compliments). But it was most\ncertainly a team effort, with every\nrebound, pass and interception being\nconverted almost instantly. The\nchampagne may have only lasted a\nfew minutes, but the day will go down\nin IC Netball history and is a day we\nwon\u2019t let the medics forget.\nWe would like to send our\ncondolences to those who actually\nbelieved the medic 2s could match IC\u2019s\nperformance in this game, it\u2019s always\nhard letting go.

Somehow the combination of lavish parties,\npublic groping and goldfish eating\nwork together, making an unforgettable 180 minutes. Though perhaps\noverlong in places, this is Scorsese at\nhis finest, managing to keep you from\nwanting to punch Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s Jordan Belfort in the face. Just.\n4) The penultimate film of the evening is Philomena, our fourth best picture nominee of the evening. Though\nalmost certainly a feel-good film, it\nmanages to avoid the normal pitfalls\nand clich\u00e9s of this sort of film, managing to be heartwarming rather than\nthe usual sentimental mush this film\ncould have so easily become. The\npremise is simple, an Irish woman\ngives birth out of wedlock and gives\nthe child up for a closed adoption to\nthe US. Years later, Philomena meets\nMartin Sixsmith, a BBC journalist with whom she decides to search\nfor her son. Much of reason that this\nfilm was such a hit was the near faultless performances by Judi Dench and\nSteve Coogan who, between them and\nthe rest of the cast, make the tear jerk-er scenes do what they are supposed\nto, and fill the rest of the film with a\nsubtle tinge of hope.\n5) The All-Nighter is wrapped up by\nthe only one of the five not to be based\non a true story, Alexander Payne\u2019s Nebraska. Continuing this year\u2019s theme\nof a monochrome film to end the\nnight, this gives a stark, surreal and\nutterly beautiful feel to the film. From\nblack and white sunset to the rolling\nfield of Nebraska, the cinematography\nis wonderful, helping to elevate it from\ngood to something truly great. As\ndoes the absurd humour, summoning\nstifled giggles and out loud laughter\nin most scenes. Especially at six in the\nmorning that this film will be playing.\nSo there you have it, this year\u2019s AllNighter line-up, featuring five Best\nPicture nominees, four true stories\nand a bucket and a half of tears. Bring\nyour friends, your mild acquaintances,\nthat guy who studies on the same floor\nof the library as you that you not to occasionally and most definitely bring a\npillow. See you there!\nThe Spring All-Nighter is on Tuesday\n25th March.\nTickets are \u00a310 online (until 4pm\non the day) or \u00a312 on the door. If you\ndon\u2019t fancy staying all night, tickets\nare \u00a33 per film on the door.\nFor an extra \u00a35, you can get All-YouCan-Eat Hot Food and Drink all night!\nThis includes the usual mix of tea, cof-fee, toasties, hot dogs, soup, pot noodles and more.\nTickets can be bought from tickets.\nimperialcinema.co.uk\n\n"

Maria\u2019s\nsupervisor is the Head of the\nDepartment in Chemical Engineering,\nProfessor Andrew Livingston.\nMaria\u2019s research focuses on\npolymeric membranes, where plastic\nmicroporous films can be used to\nremove impurities and toxic materials\nfrom pharmaceutical products.\nA conventional membrane would\ntypically break down on exposure to\norganic solvents that are used during\nthe process. The membranes that are\nsolvent stable are inefficient to use\nas they only enable a small amount\nof chemical to go through them.\nHowever, the work undertaken by\nMaria enables a greater amount of\nsolvent to pass through the membrane,\nthus the filtering speed is greater. The\ncompany Evonik has licenced two\npatents that were produced by Maria;\nEvonik are also sponsoring Maria\u2019s\nPostdoctoral research, which focusses\non creating filters that are larger so\ncan be used in industry.\nThe Director of the Graduate School,\nProfessor Sue Gibson said that:\n\u201cMaria\u2019s outstanding research in this\narea has led to a significant scientific\nbreakthrough which will have a major\nimpact on industrial purification\nprocesses.

I knew\nthat I was up against a lot of really\ninteresting and exciting projects, so\nthis was a very unexpected honour.\nI actually have a background in\nChemistry so I had never worked with\nmachines before I embarked upon\nmy PhD. The support and guidance\nI received from Imperial \u2013 especially\nfrom my supervisor \u2013 in this area has\nbeen invaluable in allowing me to\nachieve this success.

I\nThe Consequences Of A Huge Waste Of Effort\nThisweek,themediasocieties,STOIC,\nIC Radio, and Imperial\u2019s second best\nnewspaper, Felix, are moving from the\nbasement. The filthy hovel that has\nbeen the home to all of our college\u2019s\npalest and least popular dorks will be\nrenovated into something boring.\nThis past year has seen all of the\nmedia groups working closer together\nthan ever, producing some of the best\nwork ever censored by the Union\u2019s\npublicity team. But by putting all of\ntheir media eggs into one basket, and\nmoving that basket somewhere stupid,\nthey have unwittingly copied the BBC.\nOur Hangman Scientists have used\ntheir clever models and statistical\nmumbo-jumbo to extrapolate\nforwards into the future of the Media\ngroup. Based on our projections,\nFelix will be repeatedly criticised for\nbeing the mouthpiece of the Union\nby a newspaper with a somewhat\nquestionable reputation.\nThen, even after they move all of\ntheir news offices to another location,\nall of their main stories will be based\nupon their original location. Any\ncriticism of this will be met by the\ncries of \u201cNothing happens outside\nLondon!\u201d by the BBC, or \u201cWhere the\nhell is Silwood Park?\u201d by Felix.\nLastly, the once proud organisation\nwill be mired in scandal as almost\nall of their old stars turn out to have\nbeen sex offenders. \u2018Journalists\u2019 at the\nTab (I\u2019m legally required to add the\nquotation marks) have already begun\nhacking phones and guessing wildly in\norder to determine who the perverts\nare.\nBut perhaps the biggest questions\nfor the future of the Media group are:\nWhere will they move to? Will the\nstuff get any better? Are we ever going\nto get sick of Metric Moments? Will\nthe deposed Joe Letts get an enormous\nseverance package? Or will it all end in\ntears and broken promises?\nSabbactical-To-Be\nDPW\nFollowing the tumultuous events\nsurrounding the unseating of the\ntyrannical dictator, Joe Letts and his\nobedient minions, it is only right that\nwe take time to reflect on how this will\nchange student publishing at Imperial\nforever. Much like the fall of the Soviet\nUnion or Arab Spring, the great 2014\nFelix liberation will provide both hope\nan trepidation in equal measure.\nFor sure, we have rid ourselves of\none of the most evil publishing figures\nin Imperial history, but rebuilding\nprocess will be slow and the chance of\ncounter-revolution instigated by the\nOnion Knight remains an ever present\nproblem.\nMost of all, it is important the we\nstick together in these troubled times\nand really pull through, if not for\nourselves, then for the incoming class\nof 2014-15 who are, as yet, untainted\nby this horrible, horrible war.\nSo, go forth this day and write. Flood\nthe Hangman offices with all sorts of\ncolourful writings, be it the simple\njoy of discovering a new recipe/TV\nprogram or an opinion you\u2019ve always\nwanted to get on paper. Now is the\ntime for truly, we are free at last\nfrom the whip of tyranny. Long live\nHangman.\nCoup-De-Torial\nHangman\nEditor-in-Chief\n\n"

It would\nbe more appropriate to view this as\nthe return of power, freedom and\nvoice to you, the student and reader.\nThe struggle, whilst relatively short,\ncaused indescribable carnage as well\nas significant and regrettable collateral\ndamage. At approximately 3.45 am on\nthe 19th of March, Hangman and a\ngroup of loyal supporters stormed the\nFormer Felix Office taking out several\nkey section editors (thought to be\nthe entirety of News and at least one\nmember of Comment). Fierce hand-to-hand combat ensued and many\nloyal Hangman supporters died for\nthe cause.\nSlowly, however, the battle turned\nin Hangman\u2019s favour and upon seeing\nthe loss of his best lieutenant \u2013 Tessa\nDavey \u2013 the cowardly Letts decided\nto flee. In the confusion of battle, he\nsomehow managed to evade capture.\nLatest rumours suggest he may now\nbe hiding within another corrupt\npublishing regime \u2013 The Tab. In any\ncase, there is now a huge reward for\nLetts\u2019 capture, dead or alive (see\nNews).\nWhilst in normal circumstances\nLetts could have expected\nHangman\nEditor-in-Chief\nreinforcements from both STOIC and\nIC Radio, the sheer number of boxes\nand old equipment prevented Master\nof TV, Johnny \u2018mad-axe\u2019 Pratt and\nStation Manager George \u2018the butcher\u2019\nButcher from coming to their old\ncrony\u2019s aid.\nIt is said that once the news filtered\nout to the general Imperial populace\nthere were woops of joy followed by\nimpromptu communal parties on all\nfloors of the library. The exceptions, of\ncourse, were the silent sections which\nremained sacredly soundless.\nIn statement to the press and\nUniversity as a whole, Hangman said\n\u201cthis is an auspicious day in the history\nof student publications at Imperial\u201d\n\u201cWe have a proud and noble\ntradition of excellent publications\nstretching back generations. From\nthe ashes of this putrid regime it shall\narise once more\u201d.\nIn the interests of operating in a\ntransparent manner, Hangman also\ndistributed a separate press release\ndescribing the changes to be made\nto Imperial\u2019s foremost publication.\nSources also confirmed that, whilst\nEditor-elect, Philippa Skett, would\nbe allowed to continue next year, she\nwould only be in charge of day-to-day\nrunning of the new publication in a\nnewly created role entitled \u2018The Voice\nof Hangman\u201d.\nIt is thought that, despite these being\nuncertain times for Imperial student\npublications, so unpopular were the\nprevious regime that it is unlikely\nthat there would be any counter-revolution. Justice for the many\nvictims of Letts and his underlings\ncannot be finally served, however\nuntil the man himself is made to pay\nfor his atrocities.\nImperial students lining up to witness the overthrowing of Joe \u2018the bloodthristy\u2019 Letts.\nHANGMAN\n\u201cKeep\nThe Paper\nFree From\nTyranny\u201d\n\n"

For those\nof you who might remember, back\nthen a na\u00efve tech writer I had just\ndecided to splash out on a pair of\n20 quid headphones from Amazon,\nnamely the SX-907. To date this still\nremains my most popular article,\nand by which I assume that either\nI am reading my own articles way\ntoo much or that you guys are\ngenuinely interested about\nBluetooth headphones. For\nmy own sanity, I shall\nassume the latter.\nHowever my babies\ncould only last so\nlong before going\nthrough some\nu n f o r t u n a t e\naccident, I\nmanaged to\nsnap them (if\nyou really\nwant to\nknow, I sat\non them).\nThis event\nf o r c e d\nme to\nmake yet\na n o t h e r\npurchase,\na similar\npair to the\nones I had\nbought for\nmy virgin\nexperience.\nA bit more\ne x p e n s i v e ,\nt h e s e\nheadphones by\nthe 7dayshop\nwere quite\ns a t i s f a c t o r y .\nHowever, the\ncheap plastic of the\nmaterial, coupled\nwith the strange\ncharger as well as the\ncovering of the earpiece\nalways falling off, kept\nme from making rave\nreviews. However I had\npaid for these puppies, so\nI was not going to buy a new\npair until these guys gave up.\nLuckily enough for me, they\ndid just that two weeks ago\n(under somewhat suspicious\ncircumstances I must divulge). This\ngave me the opportunity of once\nagain perusing the wonders of that\nstore in the sky, namely Amazon.\nGiven recent circumstances, I was\nfeeling quite down in the dumps\nand decided to splash out. I went\nway above my initial spending limit,\nand in the end purchased the August\nEP650 Bluetooth headphones for a\nwhopping \u00a335. Given that previously\nI had spent a maximum of 25 quids,\nthis was actually quite an increase.\nHowever the reviews and 4.5 star\nrating on amazon,\nas well as\nthe\ngeneral\na w e s o m e\nlook finally\ngave me that final\nadrenaline rush I needed\nto click the purchase button.\nThe next day, my brand new\nheadphones appeared at my\ndoorstep. Given I had lived the\npast week without headphones, I\nwas really excited at what was to\ncome. When I had gotten my other\ntwo headphones, I had been quite\ndisappointed by the cheap look of the\npackaging, however for the EP650\nI was very pleasantly surprised.\nEverything looked very clean, and\nto be quite frank, rather expensive.\nFurthermore inside the box there\nwas even a manual!\nImagine that.\nGiven that\nBlue to oth\nheadphones\nare slightly more difficult configure\nthan general headphones, I found\nthis to be quite a boon that I had\nexperienced with my purchases.\nBefore I actually talk about\nthe headphones, I would like to\ncommend August for their colour\nchoices for the headphones. For the\ncheap headphones, you usually have\none colour to choose from and even\non the expensive ones it usually is\nrare to have more than three colours.\nHere we have 5 distinct\nc o l o u r s\n( a l t h o u g h\nsilver and white\ndo look quite\nsimilar). I went for\nthe blue, as that is quite\nan unusual and interesting\ncolour for headphones, and I\ndo not regret my choice. All in\nall, the ability to somewhat make\nthese headphones your own is\nmajor plus point in my book.\nNow back to the goods. A little\nsummary of the specs: These guys are\nBluetooth headphones, meaning they\nwill be able to connect to anything\nthat has Bluetooth capabilities.\nFurthermore it has a 3.5 standard\naudio socket (they supply the wire as\nwell!), which means that the EP650\ncan be used when out of battery,\nas well as with devices that\ndo not support\nB l u e t o o t h .\nFurthermore,\nthe fact that you use a micro USB\nto charge these puppies, makes a\nwelcome change from the strange\nformats of my other headphones.\nThe first impression of the\nheadphones was really positive. The\nglossy finish and design offset the use\nof plastic, and make these puppies\nlook much more expensive than they\nactually are. Given that headphones\nin general are quite large and visible,\nthis is a plus point! Furthermore after\na bit of testing, it turned out that the\nEP650 was quite flexible, making\nfor a comfortable fit on my quite\nbig head. Lastly, in terms of design,\nthese guys were quite light and the\nfact that you could fold them up\nmakes them quite portable,\nmeaning they actually\nfit in my jacket pocket!\nNow to the most\nimportant part of this\nreview: the audio.\nGiven that with\nall my previous\npurchases I had\nvery positive\nexperiences,\nI didn\u2019t think\nI could be\nimpressed.\nI couldn\u2019t\nhave been\nm o r e\nw r o n g .\nConnecting\nthe EP650\nto my\nphone was\ni n c r e d i b l y\neasy, and it\neven showed\na little battery\nicon to show\nhow charged my\nheadphones were!\nThe headphones\nwere fully charged,\nand so I was ready to go.\nGood hint btw: If you are\ntesting new headphones, try\nBohemian Rhapsody by Queen.\nIt goes all the way from low bass\nto high vocals, fully testing the\naudio equipment you are thinking\nof buying. Anyway, the moment the\nvocals of Freddie Mercury blasted\ninto my ears, I knew immediately I\nhad bought a gorgeous pair. The bass\nwas full and rounded, resonating my\near. The highs were crisp and clean.\nThe sound was gorgeous and exactly\nwhat I needed. Later on I tried the\nEP650 with other genres of music\nas well and they held up remarkable\nwell. Every song I threw at these\nheadphones was played back in an\nadmirable quality. Furthermore,\nwhen I compared these guys to\n\u00a3200 Beats, my 35 pound Augusts\nwere almost on par. I am serious, I\nwould have paid double for these\nheadphones, given the quality I was\ngetting. Also, when I plugged these\nguys in using the standard jack, the\nquality was just as good/bad as with\nthe Bluetooth, meaning you don\u2019t lose\nany quality regarding the connection\nmedium you decide to use.\nIn terms of battery, I found that the\nEP650 performed admirably in my\nevery day life, and I found that even\nafter three days I still did not need to\ncharge these guys. Also considering\nthat these headphones only take\nabout 2-3 hours to charge, I don\u2019t\nthink you really need to worry about\nthat. Also, the worst case scenario\nyou always have the audio jack, right?\nAll in all I am mighty pleased\nwith these headphones, however\nthere is one caveat. This could be\nsomething that only applies to me,\nbut even though the EP650s use soft\nmaterial and sit very comfortably,\nafter a while of use my ears would\nstart feeling really hot as well as\nhurting. Thus after 2 or 3 hours I\nfound that I needed to take them\noff and just rest my ears a bit.\nFor 35 pounds I have gotten one of\nthe best deals of my life. The sturdy\ndesign means that these guys should\nsurvive quite a while (as long as I\ndon\u2019t sit on them). Furthermore, the\nquality of the audio as well as the\nbeauty of the EP650 really, really\nbelong to Bluetooth headphones\ndoubles if not triples their price.\nSo if you in the market for a pair of\nheadphones, before checking out\nthe overpriced brand names, have\na look at the August EP650. Trust\nme, you won\u2019t be disappointed!\nI am serious, I would\nhave paid double for\nthese headphones,\ngiven the quality I\nwas getting.\n\u201c\n\u201d\n\n"

The elderly mention\nit with disgust as a classic example of\nthe shocking behaviours of the \u2018youth\nof today\u2019. To many observers, then,\nit has come as no surprise that BBC\nbig-wigs, most of them old and bald\nenough to benefit from a big wig, have\ndecided that this little puppy should\nbe put down.\nIn its 10 years on our screens, BBC3\nhas brought us some groundbreaking\ncomedy, with praise and awards\nheaped upon some of the best known\nshows of the past decade. But for\nevery Gavin and Stacey or Little\nBritain, there\u2019s been a bewildering\nvariety of appalling reality TV and\nbizarre documentaries whose mere\nnames I couldn\u2019t possibly mention\nin case someone with taste might be\nreading this.\nDespite its hit-and-miss (mainly\nmiss) \u2018factual\u2019 output, the channel\nhas been praised as an ideal training\nground for new comics, providing\nopportunities to take risks that other\nhigher profile outlets would be less\nwilling to accept. Yet last week, 8 of\nits 10 most watched shows were either\nfilms or old Family Guy episodes \u2013\nhardly the radical new programming\nparaded as the channel\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre.\nAlright, I\u2019ll admit it. As you may\nhave noticed from my use of the phrase\n\u201craison d\u2019\u00eatre\u201d, I\u2019m not a regular viewer\nof BBC3. Despite still, just, being a\nteenager, I have a mental age of about\n50, and so have failed to find much on\nthe channel particularly appealing.\nBut, despite my personal feelings, as a\npublicly funded broadcaster, the BBC\nis still obliged to provide something\nfor everyone, whatever their age,\nbackground and preferences, which is\nwhy this decision has been attacked by\nmany in the popular press.\nCritics have portrayed the channel\u2019s\ndemise as a bunch of old middle-class\nmen forcing young people to take\nthe brunt of the financial hardship.\nBut is this decision really down to\na war between the generations? Or\nis it simply the most efficient way\nof cutting expenditures? The man\nwielding the axe, Director-General\nTony Hall, now a venerable 63, insists\nits move to an afterlife on the iPlayer is\npreferable to the \u2018salami-slicing\u2019 of key\nservices that has become a familiar\nsymptom of budget cuts in many\nmajor organisations.\nI agree with this. I don\u2019t see this\ndecision as a \u201cwar on the young\u201d (as a\nrecentHuffingtonPostpiecedescribed\nit), but as a war on bad programming.\nBBC3 is a channel aimed not at young\npeople, but at a patronising caricature\nof a young person sat on a desk in a big\noffice at the top of broadcasting house.\nI\u2019d like to inform the BBC that most of\nus are, for instance, perfectly capable\nof taking in news without it first having\nto be condensed into 60-second\n\u2018bitesize\u2019 chunks, with news about the\neconomy being balanced out with a\nhealthy dose of Justin Bieber.\nThemoveonline,alongwithabudget\ncut, will hopefully focus the channel\u2019s\ncontent onto a smaller number of\nhigher quality programmes. This\ncan only be a good thing. The iPlayer,\none of the biggest brands in digital\nmedia, will be a fitting home for the\nchannel and the digital generation it\u2019s\naimed at. This, I hope, will provide an\nengaging, high-quality, maybe even\nintelligent service targeted at young\npeople, alongside the multitude of\npopular programmes on the BBC\u2019s\nother channels.\nSo, for once, I\u2019m happy with this\nparticular round of cuts.\nJust so long as they don\u2019t get rid of\nBBC4.\nEDITORIAL TEAM: Editor-in-Chief Joe Letts News Editors Nida Mahmud, Aamna Mohdin, Aemun Reza, Maciej Matuszewski Features Editor Shiladitya Ghosh Wellbeing Editor Marissa Lewis Business Editor\nJames Tsim Science Editors Philippa Skett, Keir Little, Fiona Hartley Politics Editor Kartikeya Rana, Jash Rughani Food Editors Carol Ann Cheah, Michael Chung Comment Editors Eoghan J.

They spent the\nfirst five minutes camped inside the\nmedics\u2019 half, winning both a scrum\nand a lineout within the medics\u2019\n22.

As the only University in Japan specialising entirely in the Social\nSciences, and one of the top-ranking\nJapanese Universities, it may be helpful to think of it as the Japanese LSE.\nThis visit constituted the third in a series of annual exchanges from one of\nour clubs to the other, with some of\nour members and theirs recognising\neach other from the trip to Japan our\nclub held last Summer.\nOn Wednesday 26th February, the\nJapanese students joined us for one\nof our regular practice sessions. Our\nmembers were eager to practice with\nkendoka who on average start training\nin secondary school, and they were\nnot disappointed, with yours truly\nunable to even touch their strongest\nplayers.\nOn our Thursday practice the following day, our guests took a teaching role as they showed us a series of\nmovements known as kata. Kata are\nfairly common in kendo as a method\nof practicing movements that, whilst\nnot necessarily being useful directly\nin a match, can help train the mind to\nmove one\u2019s body efficiently or notice\nopenings in the opponents stance, as\nwell as being required to pass kendo\ngradings.\nHowever, the kata shown to us by our\nvisitors was different. Called Hojyo, it\nwas a series of four movements, each\nsymbolising a different season, developed by Hitotsubashi and passed\ndown from senpai to kouhai over the\nyears. Obviously, our members were\nvery excited to see this rare display,\nand were deeply honoured when they\ntook the time to teach us the first\nmovement, based on Spring.\nOur next meeting was on Saturday in\nEthos, where we faced off in a friendly\n10-person team match. Even with\nTeam Britain augmented by top ken-doka from nearby clubs, they slaughtered us 6\u20133, and we went in earnest\ninto a practice session, followed by\nlunch at Eastside.\nThe following day saw us take the train\nto Cambridge, where, at the request\nof our new friends, we spent the day\nsightseeing. After arriving just in time\n(read: 10 minutes late) for our booked\npunt, we had lunch and visited the col-leges, before catching a train back to\nLondon, with both sides eagerly making plans for our next meeting, when\nour club will once again fly over to Japan to hone our skills in the country of\nkendo\u2019s creation.\nIC 4s gain\npromotion\nin style\nOlivia Szepietowski\nIC Polo Captain\nSaturday 15th March. A date all members of the 4th team had pencilled in\ntheir diary for a long time. The season\ndecider awaited. A win would guarantee promotion. Anything else was\nunimaginable. Fogo had consumed\nhis handful of blueberries and bowl\nof porridge in order to increase his\nconcentration levels by 15%. A pack of\ntwisters had been gleefully destroyed\nby the team to obtain optimal glucose\nlevels for the match. Before beginning\nour journey to #FortressHarlington,\nwe had to wait for the arrival of the\ntardy Guy Frankel and Alex Cravingdale, who decided they would be even\ntardier and take about half an hour to\ngrab some food from the library Caf\u00e9.\nApparently an ABC (Avocado Bacon\nChicken) was key to his recovery from\na seemingly traumatic and exhausting\ntwo nights out, which included drinking one whole beer on Friday. Such is\nCravingdale\u2019s 90210-esque lifestyle.\nNevertheless we arrived in good time\nand had the pleasure of changing in\nmain Harlington as well as playing\non the show pitch in the glorious sun,\nhoping for a glorious outcome. Africa\nby Toto played on Dylan\u2019s \u2018\u00a33 Ebay\nspeakers, \u00a32 for delivery\u2019 gave us plenty of inspiration if not audio quality.\nMany bananas were consumed as well\nas an excellent balance of water and\nLucozade sport, a level of pre-match\npreparation unheard of at university\nlevel.\nThe match started a bit cagily. IC were\ndominant in possession but not quite\nso much in territory. They looked\nquite dangerous on the break with\ntwo BBUs up front. A well-positioned\nInigo Torres made a vital clearance\noff the line. However, once the 4s got\na foothold in the game, there was no\nlooking back. Fogo\u2019s blueberry and\nporridge breakfast really looked to be\ndoing the trick, having already looked\ndangerous in the opening stages, he\nlatched onto a Cravingdale lofted\nthrough ball and took the shot ridiculously early in Thierry Henry-esque\nfashion, bamboozling the goalkeeper\nas the ball trickled past him into the\nback of the net. 1-0.\nAnd it wasn\u2019t long before it was 2-0.\nEvery second ball was won by IC, and\nafter a UCL free kick was launched\ninto the IC half, this time was no dif-ferent. Eventually Edin Dzeko scrambling the ball towards Cravingdale\nwho skinned his left back for not the\nlast time of the match and slotted\nfirmly into the bottom left corner.\nIC continued to press and played\nsome mesmerising football. Unafraid\nto play out from the back and wait for\nthe right moment to break forward,\nthe 4s really began to show their class.\nHenry Rowett was finding all sorts\nof space between the lines and Matt\nKnights played it into his feet, where\nHenry turned and played a sumptuous\nthrough ball between the opposition\nfull back and centre-half, Cravingdale\nnonchalantly latched onto it, playing\nan inch-perfect low \u2018triple tap x\u2019 cross\nto Fogo, who slotted once more. 3-0.\nAnd before half time it was 5-0 to IC\n4s. Another fast attack down the right\nwon a throw in by the corner flag. The\nball went loose but Henry managed to\nlatch onto it and harmlessly prodded\nit back towards Cravingdale who was\n30 yards out in the inside right chan-nel. Of course the obvious thing to do\nwas to \u2018Yaya Tour\u00e9\u2019 it into the top left\ncorner with the instep, and he duly\nobliged. An outrageous effort.\nThe fifth was bizarrely similar to the\nthird, a fast break down the right and\na low cross, ending in a first half hat\ntrick for Fogo Adelowo. The enigma\nstrikes once more.\nThree assists and two goals wasn\u2019t\nquite enough for Cravingdale to earn\nthe right to play the second half, and\nhe has since gracefully apologized for\nletting the team down. On came Josh\nParsi. We were eager to prove that the\nfirst half was no fluke, and wanted to\ncarry on playing confident football\nwith a few more goals. After all, fantasy points were at stake.\nWe all wanted a bit of the action, and\ncaptain/tactical mastermind extraor-dinaire Chris Schon managed to get\nhis spot on the limelight, latching\nonto a goalkeeping error from a Dan\nGregory corner and bundling the ball\ninto the back of the net. Fogo added\ntwo more to his tally with a couple of\ntrademark lobs, one from an exquisite\nJosh Parsi lobbed through ball.\nThe game was rounded off by a mod-ern-day miracle. A goal from Guy\nFrankel. Henry found acres of space\nin the midfield once more. He turned\nand received a thunderous shout from\nFrankel to play one more, which he\ndid. The pass was weighted perfectly,\nand upon cries of \u2018BANG IT\u2019 primarily from Edin Dzeko, Frankel did as he\nwas told and BANGED IT first time\nfrom twenty yards into the bottom\nleft corner. 9-0 and the cherry on top\nof the icing on the cake. Promotion\nsecured in the most emphatic style.\nChanging room champagne shower\nand midnight KFC well earned.\nICUAFC is sponsored by:\nImperial\u2019s 11 players were prepared\ntake on the table-topping Chichester, who had yet to drop a point this\nseason. The opponents kicked off the\nfirst half and chased well to settled\ninto Imperial\u2019s 22. They retained possession through numerous phases and\ncombined well between forwards and\nbacks. Good support in defense saw\nImperial turn the ball on several occasions but were unable to clear their\nlines having to kick against the blistering wind. Chichester even managed to\nmake their way over the 5 m line, but\nImperial held firm despite playing the\nfirst 10 minutes in their own half.\nAfter winning possession, Imperial finally carried the ball over the half way\nline. Edging towards the 22 yard line,\nPip Heggie crashed through the opposition\u2019s forward pack and drew in de-fenders. Support followed swiftly and\nfly half Kath Fok stepped around her\nopposite number 10 and took on three\nof the opposition offloading from the\nground to Charlotte Stephens. She\npassed on to the outside centre and\nback of the match Carolanne Vouriot who came running at speed. She\ncrashed and weaved her way through\nseveral tackles to go over the line. Imperial drew first blood and scrum half\nLana Lee converted the try for the 7-0\nlead.\nAgain Chichester came back strong.\nThey finally saw sense to go wide and\ntake advantage of their extra player in\ntheir backline and coupled this with\nstrong runs from their fullback. Even\nwith organised defensive play, Imperial were a player down and Chichester\nwere able to run around the outside\nto score on the wing. Imperial held\non until just before half time where\nagain the backs were outnumbered\nand Chichester found space to run\nthrough and score a second try. At\nthe half time whistle, the score stood\nat 7-10.\nImperial returned the favour from the\nkick off in the second half to camp in\nChichester\u2019s half. A clearing kick was\ncharged down by Kath Fok and Imperial reacted well to win possession.\nWithin their 5 m line, Chichester\u2019s\nplayers were scrambling in defense\nand conceeded penalty for not rolling away at the tackle. The resulting\npenalty saw Captain Pip Heggie run\na short dummy line with the ball instead going long to Charlie Stephens\nwho powered through for a the fourth\ntry of the match. Taking the conversion again, Imperial were in the lead\nat 14-10.\nWith plenty of time still on the clock,\nChichester kept running at Imperial\nand their backs had many set plays to\nshow off. In a moment of creativity,\ntheir outside centre chased her own\nkick into space behind Imperial\u2019s line.\nFull back Sammy Gottardi worked\nhard to chase her back and the resulting pressure prevented Chichester\nfrom grounding the ball successfully.\nThere was an impressive effort from\nImperial\u2019s defense with forward of\nthe match Alice Liberman putting in\ncountless tackles around the breakdown and supporting quickly over\nthe rucks to turn over Chichester ball.\nLikewise, the midfield pair of Charlie and Carolanne were impenetrable\nand making Chichester to go wide\nand forcing their backline into making mistakes. Still Chichester had not\nchoice but keep trying to go to their\nextra player on the outside where they\nwere met by Sammy and winger Rabia Lakhani who combined to prevent\nthem breaking down the far side.\nChichester were always threatening\nand eventually changed tack. Their\noutside centre to cut back against\nthe traffic and broke through behind\nthe breakdown from the 22, running\nthrough to score. Unable to take the\nconversion, Imperial were still only\none point behind at 14-15, with 15\nminutes of play left.\nHowever, the intensity of the game\nproved to be too much and Chichester\nwere able to bring on their fresh legs\nwhilst continuing to pile pressure onto\nImperial. Despite the heroic effort\nfrom across the team to retain recycle\nthe ball in attack and fend off Chichester\u2019s onslaught, they eventually scored\ntwice more with the game finishing at\n14-27.\nWith the last game of BUCS complet-ed, the team turn to their remaining\ntwo games in LUSL, needing wins in\nboth games to retain the title!\nImperial lose at Chichester\nKatherine Fok gives her account\nWon?

If you\u2019ve\ncome here looking for the\nusual team sport reports\nthen you have made a serious\nmistake. Not so much that you have\nfound the wrong place, this is indeed,\nwhere they normally are. The problem\nlies in the fact that your life has come\nto this. You are, presumably, so bored\nthat you\u2019d read any old rubbish about\nsomething that truly does not matter.\nIndeed, not only does no one outside\nthe immediate team give a fuck about\nuniversity sport, but it seems crazy to\neven have a section dedicated to pages\nand pages of the stuff.\nSure, partake in all the sports you want\nand by all means, enjoy it. But let[t]\ns just stop pretending that the match\nreports from these things are even\nworth the ink they\u2019re printed with.\nOh yeah, great you travelled to\n[unknown university] and gave\nthem a good thrashing/a stout game\ncongratulations. Please, please, please\nnever talk about it again, especially\nnot in a public space like a student\nnewspaper.\nI mean, it\u2019s not like there exist anyone\nbeyond the immediate team that\neven has the remotest emotional\ninvestment in how that team\nperforms in one of the many, equally\nunimportant competitions available\nto student sports teams.\nGo ahead, accuse me of glory-hunting,\nbut I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in not giving\na flying fuck how the football 5th team\ndid in the competition where half the\nteams didn\u2019t turn up and the other half\nforgot to bring their kits.\nHowever, even this could be tolerable\nif the teams didn\u2019t presumably\nhire illiterate primates to write the\nreports for them. They are often so\nunintelligible as to represent little\nmore than the random arrangement\nof letters on a page.\nIndeed, it is impossible to rule\nout the concept that all the match\nreports are randomly generated by\nsome computer deep in caverns of\nEthos that produces endless strings\nof meaningless platitudes about how\neveryone was contributing to the\nteam effort despite the spirit-crashing\nthrashing the team has received.\nNone of this is helped by the fact that\nPremier League\nPredictions\nSaturday\nChelsea v Arsenal\nThese two teams have both\ndone well so far with their players.\nHowever, there is good reason to\nsuspect that these players aren\u2019t\nquite the players they were when\nthey last played. It\u2019ll be a close one\nbut since whoever normally writes\nthis is a Chelsea fan, I\u2019ll have to go\nfor them. Prediction: 4-0\nCardiff v Liverpool\nBoth of these sides play in red so\nthat could be a problem unless one\nside manages to dye their shirts in\nwhich case we should be fine. The\n15:00 kick will probably favour\nLiverpool as they have the better\nteam. Prediction: 2-7\nEverton v Swansea\nEverton and Swansea, now there\nare two teams that play a lot of\nfootball. Roberto Martinez, a man\nwho\u2019s managed a lot of teams.\nGarry Monk, not so many. It\u2019s all\npointing towards an Everton win,\nbut in this unpredictable Universe\nit would be foolish to rule out any\nscenario.

Hull it has\ntranspired recently are liable to be\nhead-butted at any moment, which\nin normal circumstances would\nbe a disadvantage but, perversely,\ncan be an advantage in football.\nIt would be the height of the\narrogance to dare predict the result\nof this one. Prediction: 2-1\nMan City v Fulham\nDie Miester. Die Besten. Les\nGrands Equipes. The main event.\nYes, neither of these teams is in\nthe Champions League which is\nthe main reason why they\u2019re both\nplaying one another in a match\nthat it is already being dubbed as\n\u201cON\u201d this weekend. Man City have\nliterally all the good players but\nalso Martin Demichellis for some\nreason. This should give Fulham\neternal hope and I fully expect\nthem to come away with all three\npoints this weekend. Prediction:\n1-3\nNewcastle v Crystal Palace\nThis match essentially boils down\nHangman\nEditor-in-Chief\nto France vs A Team Of Players\nBarely Anyone Has Heard Off and\nsuch is thought to be likely to be very\nclose. France have already managed\nto secure qualification for the World\nCup this summer so are unlikely\nto be particularly interested in the\nresult. Crystal Palace, however, have\nit all to do if they are to feature in\nBrazil in June. Expect big things\nfrom Marouane Chamakh for some\nreason, most probably because he\u2019ll\nbe schamakhing them in. Prediction:\n3-6\nNorwich v Sunderland\nIs there anything about this\nNorwich v Sunderland match\nthat hasn\u2019t already been written?\nI doubt it, but I\u2019m bravely forging\non regardless. Gus Poyet, as is his\nwant, will probably work himself\ninto such a rage that he will just have\nto rip his jacket it off and throw it\nas Wes Brown [West Brom?]. Chris\nHughton, however, is just lucky\nto have a jacket at all as a nice one\nis quite hard to find in Norwich.\nRegardless, everyone on all sides\nwill be rooting for Fabio Borini to do\nalright. Prediction: 3-3 (Sunderland\nto go through on Away Goals).\nWest Ham Utd v Man Utd\nNo one can claim that these are not\nUnited, especially in their mutual\ndesire to play a \u201crocking, locking and\npopping\u201d game of football to quote\nyoung Man Utd fan, David Moyes.\nIt\u2019s hard to see past West Ham\nand their front three of Downing,\nNolan and Carroll but that\u2019s mainly\nbecause Andy Carroll\u2019s exceptionally\ntall and wide like a double-decker\nbus. Prediction: 1-1\nSunday\nTottenham v Southampton\nTwo teams that play beautiful\nfootball and Tottenham will battle\nthis one out. Spurs are now very\nclose to being able to drop all their\nsummer signings in a last ditch\nattempt to revert to Gareth Bale.\nHowever, instinct tells me they won\u2019t\nmanage it this week and Saints with\ntheir better team and better manager\nwill see this one out comfortably.\nPrediction: 0-5\nAston Villa v Stoke\nInfamous grudge match which\nneither team will want to lose,\nalthough you\u2019ve got to hope that\nneither go into a match wanting\nto lose. Since both sides are the\nepitome of average I\u2019m going to have\nto assume Stoke will win by a Peter\nCrouch dirty goal and Johnathon\nWalters non-penalty to a Fabian\nDelph 100yard screamer. Prediction:\n1-2\nthe editing process seems to consist of\nseveral rounds of concentration of the\ntext to reach the impenetrable levels\nwith which we find them.\nIt then seems that the only logical way\nto present the texts is with no images\nwhatsoever as, presumably, images\nwould be highly distracting for the\nsort of idiots who grab a copy of the\nnewspaper only to read the reports of\nthe 5th lacrosse team.\nTo conclude, if you did come here\nlooking for the latest updates on how\nthe water polo side got on then you are\neither in the side (in which case you\nshould probably remember) or you\u2019re\ntemporarily out of the side, in which\ncase you can probably ask any number\nof your obnoxious friends what the\nscore was if you are still somehow\npossessed with a burning desire to\nacquire useless facts.\nThankfully, the Hangman revolution\nwill put a stop to this bullshit and will\nonly occasionally include important\nsport and very, very rarely include\nImperial sports teams and even then\nonly when they\u2019ve one something\nextremely important like the World\nCup or the Ashes.\nHangman describes the overall antipathy of all students towards\nall university level sports.\nSPORTZ 21/03/14\nIssue 1573\nEditor:\nMr Sport\n\u201cKeep\nThe Paper\nFree From\nTyranny\u201d\nInsert\nGeneric\nSports Image\nHere\n\n"

    "content": "\u201cKeep the\nCat Free\u201d\nL\nast Sunday the College was\nvisited by Adonis Georgiadis,\nthe Greek Health Minister.\nThe event \u2013 organised by the\nImperial College Hellenic\nSociety and held in the Clore Lecture\nTheatre \u2013 both from College and\noutside. One Imperial student gives\nhis perspective:\nOn Sunday, Adonis Georgiadis was\ninvited to Imperial College London to\ndiscuss the Greek crisis and how the\ncountry can move forward. The event\nwas supported by the LSE Hellenic\nSociety, the IC European Union\nSociety, the IC Economics Society,\nPromote Greece and Omikron\nGreece. I\u2019ve been waiting for this\nall week, unsure of what to expect\nfrom both the crowd and the guests.\nI\u2019m in the lecture theater waiting\nfor the talk to start, pen and paper in\nhand. The atmosphere feels heavy but\nmaybe that\u2019s just me. The audience\nis comprised of men and women of\nvarious ages \u2013 from the snippets of\nconversation I pick up they\u2019re mostly\nGreek.\nThe Health Minister is 20 minutes\nlate \u2013 at this point a group of people\nhand out a declaration composed by\nGreek Imperial Students and Staff\nagainst the invitation of Georgiadis\nto Imperial. As time goes by, people\nget more excited, more tense.\nConversation gets louder. Someone\nfrom the crowd asks how long we\u2019ll\nbe waiting for, one of the organizers\nreplies that he\u2019ll be here at 17:30.\n\u201cYou should have told us, we\u2019re busy\npeople. We\u2019re not all Ministers\u201d. The\nheckling has begun.\nThe minister walks in more than\nhalf an hour late, met with a mixture\nof booing and clapping. As the\nMinister and all the other guests\nwalk in and take their seats, the\nchair of the Hellenic Society, Mixalis\nDinalexis, takes the stand and makes\na small introductory speech. As he\ntalks the polarization in the room\nbecomes evident. In the front sit the\nmembers of the Society responsible\nfor organising the event and those\nwho are in agreement with the whole\nidea. In the back are those unhappy\nwith this initiative \u2013 those who\nare angry at the Government and\nthe Health Minister. As Dinalexis\ntalks there are angry comments and\nlaughter coming from the back \u2013 not\na good sign. However right before\nhe steps off the podium he makes a\ngood point \u201c\u2026Who would be better\nfor a challenging discussion than the\nMinister of Health\u201d. It is admittedly\nvery hard to corner Georgiadis,\nso a challenging discussion is an\nunderstatement of what is about to\nfollow.\nThe Greek Ambassador is given\nhis turn to speak and welcome\nthe Health Minister. Shortly after,\nGeorgiadis gets up to speak and\nbriefly, chaos ensues. Again clapping\nmixed with booing and comments\nregarding Georgiadis\u2019 affiliations\nwith LAOS [Popular Orthodox\nRally \u2013 a populist right wing Greek\npolitical party] spark a series of\ncomments from the Minister\nincluding: \u201cSo this is the Troika [the\nEuropean Union, European Central\nBank and International Monetary\nFund \u2013 the three groups responsible\nfor the Greek bailout] resistance,\nwhat a resistance! I\u2019ll start crying!...\nI don\u2019t deserve this charade\u201d. He\nends up challenging the hecklers to\ncome on the stage and talk openly.\nA young woman takes the invitation\nand proceeds to read a prepared\nstatement that paints a sad yet true\npicture of the state of Public Health\nin Greece, based on facts and studies.\nShe talks with confidence, as the\naudience listens in silence.\nAs Georgiadis tries to reply to\nthe points made in the decleration,\nshouts and insults are shot at\nhim again. At some point he yells\nout sarcastically: \u201c\u2026what a great\ndemocracy you are\u2026. I can reply\n(but) it will never be possible for us to\nunderstand each other\u201d. As the crowd\nsettles down, he starts tackling the\npoints made in the declaration again.\nHe starts off by renouncing political\nresponsibility prior to 2011. He then\ndescribes the actions taken to tackle\nthe crisis. Again the crowd reacts\nand the conversation deteriorates.\nAt some point Georgiadis is heard\nasking the audience: \u201cYou are the\ndemocrats? You know nothing about\ndemocracy\u2026. If you think you are a\nresistance to the Troika by spending\nyour parents money\u2026\u201d The audience\nis justifiably outraged, several\npeople are clearly professionals, not\naffiliated with Imperial and can be\nheard shouting back: \u201cWe work!\u201d\nAt this point one of the organisers\ntakes over and asks both sides to\nhave a civilized conversation without\ninsulting each other. The Minister\nstarts talking again. To questions\nabout the cuts, the privatisations and\ntheir necessity the Minister replies\nin a challenging tone \u201c\u2026the people\ndecided to keep the country in the\nEurozone and this is what it\u2019s taken\nto stay in the Eurozone \u2026 Can you\nfind a solution to a country that is\nbankrupt? \u2026 I believe that the state\ncannot make profitable enterprises.\nThe people voted for me. We believe\nthat privatizing will create revenue.\nIf you are PASOK [Panhellenic\nSocialist Movement \u2013 cenre-left\nGreek political party] I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThe discussion continues for a total\nof about two hours.

    "content": "28 FRIDAY 21 MAR\nFILM Editor: John Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nJesse feels the need for meth speed\nNeed for Speed\nDirector: Scott Waugh\nWriters: George Gatins, John Gatins\nStarring: Aaron Paul, Dominic\nCooper, Imogen Poots, Dakota\nJohnson, Michael Keaton, Scott\nMescudi, Remi Malek, Ramon\nRodriguez, Harrison Gilbertson\nRuntime: 132 minutes\nCertification: 12A\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nSurely the overwhelming critical success of Breaking Bad could have set up\nAaron Paul for a better cinematic role\nthan this one. He has won two Primetime Emmys, and yet one of the first\nroles he manages to land is in a video\ngame adaptation, a category of films\nthat historically have the tradition of\nsucking. Need for Speed is no exception to this rule, and no matter how\nlow you set your expectations, chances are, you are likely to walk away from\nhaving witnessed one of the early contenders to be the worst film of 2014.\nTrying to cash in on the mega-suc-cess of the Fast & Furious franchise,\nwhich already has a seventh film in\nproduction, we are introduced to a\ngroup of characters cut from the exact same cloth (a wronged, clean-cut\nhero, a surprisingly masculine female\nwho knows a lot about cars, a greasy\nvillain who has the hero\u2019s potential\nlove interest, a naive young guy etc).\nWhat the Fast & Furious series lacked\nin decent story and characters, it\nmade up for in sensational racing se-quences. Need for Speed fails to even\nget that part right.\nA wrongly imprisoned Tobey Marshall (Aaron Paul) is back with nothing but vengeance running on his\nmind. The circumstances surrounding\nhis unlawful imprisonment is ridiculous enough, but what follows is even\nmore preposterous than before.\nSo there is a death, although it\u2019s never sad, because the victim can\u2019t shut up\nabout his \u201cvision\u201d relating to Tobey\u2019s\n\u201cdestiny\u201d (really), and the responsible bad guy, Dino Brewster (Dominic\nCooper), dressed in black, strutting\nhis stuff, manages to get away with it,\nputting the blame solely on Tobey. After his release from prison, Tobey decides to take part in an underground\nsupercar race competition hosted by\nDJ Monarch (Michael Keaton) in order to...clear his name and get back at\nDino? How the exact logistics work\nnever quite make sense.\nThe film prides itself in having put\ntogether action sequences that did not\nuse any CGI. There is a way of making\nthings work without the help of computer graphics. Bullitt and The French\nConnection managed this in the 1960s\nand 70s, and yet Scott Waugh, a stunt\ncoordinator-turned-director whose\ndebut was the corny Act of Valour\nthat dealt with an elite team of Navy\nSEALs. The chases themselves are irritatingly noisy rather than pulse-rac-ing, having the loud, screeching Imogen Poots trying to be funny doesn\u2019t\nhelp things one bit, as not even Aaron\nPaul\u2019s intensity and focus on his mission are enough to barely carry this\nfilm through.\nTobey is blessed with having a couple of sidekicks - Finn (Rami Malek)\ngets properly naked in the film\u2019s most\npointless, bizarre scene, whereas\nBenny (Scott Mescudi) has a knack\nfor stealing all sorts of helicopters and\nprovide air support for Tobey. Benny\nis also capable of giving 100% accurate\ninformation regarding surrounding\ntraffic and come up with methods of\noutrunning the police. He basically\nacts like ARIA that tormented Shia\nLaBeouf in Eagle Eye. Yes, Benny is so\nincredible that he possesses the skills\nof a super-computer.\nThe obligatory love line that needs\nto be struck up is abysmal to say the\nleast. Tobey has two potential candi-dates. Anita (Dakota Johnson), the girl\nwho is now with Dino, or Julia (Imo-gen Poots), an English girl who tags\nalong for the ride. Johnson, playing\na dumb, dim-witted female, proves\nshe must be well-suited for the very\nsimilar role in 50 Shades of Grey, and\nPoots\u2019 Hollywood breakout role is going ot have to come from something\nelse. She reportedly has five films to be\nreleased in 2014. That Awkward Moment didn\u2019t do much for her, neither\nwill Need for Speed. Let\u2019s hope any one\nof the future releases sticks.\nWorst however, is Michael Keaton\u2019s\nparticipation in the film. He is DJ\nMonarch, the host of the races, who\noften provides pointless, tiresome\nnarration throughout the film even\nthough no one asked for it. He is insistent on talking through every single\nplot point, just in case the audience\ncannot follow the mind-numbingly\nsimple plot developments on offer\nhere.\nAnd the ending? It all comes back to\nthat \u201cvision\u201d. Such an ill-advised final\nnote that people started sniggering.\nOther video adaptations that didn\u2019t work out\nDOA: Dead or Alive\nMore like Dead on Arrival this one:\nalthough boasting a relatively impressive cast for a film of this standard,\nand although boasting some good\naction, audiences were clearly not interested in seeing a badly acted rehash\nof a fighting game adaptation. It only\nstuck around in the North American\ntheatres for three weeks, throughout which it managed to gross under\n500,000 dollars.\nMax Payne\nA low-point even for Mark Wahlberg\nwho participated in M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s The Happening, this is an overly-serious, highly illogical piece in which\nthe leading character who should be\na competent killing machine has next\nto no intelligence to solve a mystery\nthat has an answer that\u2019s staring him\nin the face. Mila Kunis doesn\u2019t come\nclose to pulling off the badass nature\nsurrounding his Russian assassin role.\nPrince of Persia\nLooked pretty terrible on paper, starting with the casting of Jake Gyllenhaal, and the desire to turn this into\na money-making Pirates of the Caribbean-type franchise completely back-fired, as its hefty budget of 200 million\ndollars was only barely reached and\nfailed to turn into a blockbuster prof-it-making machine. There is plenty of\nwooden dialogue, and not even some\ndecent slow-mo action saves this.\nDoom\nNot even the presence of The Rock\ncan inject some excitement or fun in\nthis disaster. It\u2019s a repetitive collection of first-person shooter scenes\nthat drearily strings along. There is a\nlot of screaming, a lot of running from\nmysterious alien creatures that pick\noff humans one by one. It\u2019s a lame survival drama, where you can figure out\nwho does and doesn\u2019t make it in the\nend within the first five minutes.\nHitman\nThey\u2019re giving this a reboot with English actor Rupert Friend in the title\nrole, although it\u2019s not clear how much\nof a difference that will have given the\nlong line of failed films based on video\ngames. It\u2019s a missed opportunity, given\nhow much you see Timothy Olyphant\ntries in the lead role. Once again it\u2019s\nthe lack of a coherent plot that\u2019s the\nmain problem, with very little focus\non the character himself.\n\n"

    "content": "7\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 21 MAR\nFEATURES\nlady who was suffering greatly from\nAlzheimer\u2019s, and it was a story about\nhow \u2018nothing lasts forever\u2019, how glory\nalways fades. If you look at it as a piece\nof drama, rather than as an attempt\nto be a documentary on Margaret\nThatcher, suddenly it comes to life\nand you see it for what it is. But if you\nthink that this is the story of Margaret\nThatcher then you are wasting your\ntime. Go and read Charles Moore\u2019s\nbrilliant book \u2013 don\u2019t watch a movie.\nFrom the movie you might be able to,\nand you should, find many insights\ninto Margaret Thatcher, but it\u2019s not\ngoing to be the \u2018truth\u2019. What is the\n\u2018truth\u2019? I read a history book and I say,\n\u201cIs this the truth?\u201d And it\u2019s never the\nwhole truth, sometimes it\u2019s not even\nclose to the truth and that\u2019s history\nbooks.\nHow was joining the House of Lords\nwith the spectre of revolutionary\nreform looming over it?\nOh, rather exciting. Rather\nengaging. I got here just over three\nyears ago and worked very hard to\nunderstand it [House of Lords] and to\nget to know its ways. You can\u2019t come\ninto an institution like this and think\nyou know everything \u2013 it\u2019s silly. Most\nthat do so make fools of themselves.\nWhat I had done is come to hugely\nrespect the core of the institution and\na huge chunk of my colleagues here.\nIt needs reform. Yeah, we are trying\nto reform it \u2013 desperately! The one\nman who has been trying to stand in\nthe way of the reform that we want\nis Nick Clegg. But to elect it would\nmake us like that place down the other\nend *fingers pointing*, the House of\nCommons. I can see no real advantage\nin that and I can see lots of huge\ndisadvantages in that: it would make\nit more expensive, more professional.\nI think that we would rush ahead with\nthat sort of reform very unwisely.\nThe place works surprisingly well. It\ncan be made better and we want it to\nbe made better. But the proposal for\nreform was shambolic, dreamed up on\nthe back of an envelope; they hadn\u2019t\nthought it through and it quite rightly\ngot thrown on the dustbin of history. I\nhope that as and when and if they do\ncome back with further measures for\nreform they would be better thought\nthrough than that.\nWho do you think was responsible\nfor killing off the Private Member\u2019s\nBill [EU Referendum Bill] you were\nsteering through the Lords?\nOh, the Labour Party and the\nLiberal Democrats. You just had Mr\nMiliband announce that he\u2019s not\ngoing to guarantee an EU referendum\nat the next election. I believe George\nOsborne at Cabinet suggested that\nin the next Queen\u2019s speech we have\nthe EU Referendum Bill and the Lib\nDems said \u201cover our dead bodies!\u201d\nAnd it was always going to be that\nway. I mean part of the exercise was\nto smoke them out and see where\nthey stood. I remember on the final\nvote it was really rather bizarre, there\nwere people saying \u201cwe must discuss\nand analyse and debate this bill very\nthoroughly, but we are not going to\nallow you the time to do it\u2026\u2019\u201d so they\nvoted to end the sitting at three o\u2019clock\non a Friday and one of their members\nwas standing up in the chamber, in the\nconfusion of the chamber, pointing\nat the division lobby saying \u201cthis way\nto kill the bill!\u201d Umm, thank you very\nmuch! I mean, we have now clearly\nestablished where all the parties stand\non the EU Referendum Bill. From\nmy point of view, the only way that\nanybody is going to be guaranteed\na referendum on the EU is to have a\nConservative government after the\nnext election. Incidentally, an EU\nreferendum is not pro or anti. It is\nsimply about stopping all this political\nnonsense that the parties have been\nup to over the decades. It is about\nsaying that the people, you guys, it\u2019s\nyour future, you decide! And a lot of\npeople who are desperately in favour\nof a referendum are very pro-EU.\nLord Dobbs, thank you for your\ntime.\nMy pleasure!\nCan you tell us a bit about\nyour current business in the\nsustainability sector?\nYes I can! Our name is Whotter;\nour team consists of myself, Carlo,\na PHD from Physics and Arthur\na Masters student from Paris. We\nare trying to harness green energy\nfrom waste as never done before. It\u2019s\nan innovative idea, we have some\nfunding in the bag and a coach, Nicola\n(a successful entrepreneur) to help us\nwith it. Our aim is to provide a more\nenvironmentally friendly technology\nin comparison to incineration,\nAnaerobic digestion etc, to harness\nenergy while sustainably treating\nwaste on a large scale. We have been\nworking on the idea for about three\nmonths now and have faced a number\nof hurdles. In fact the initial idea\nactually failed when we put it to test\nhypothetically in the market, but we\ndid learn a lot from the failure and\nnow have kind of refined it! Fingers\ncrossed, if all goes well we might have\na start-up very soon inshallah [God\nwilling]!\nI understand that you were\nselected for the scheme as part of a\ncompetition that you entered. Other\nthan backing the business idea,\nwhat else does the prize include?\nYes,ourideawasselectedinascheme\ncalled Green House run by ClimateKIC, we got our funding and coach as\npart of this scheme. It all started last\nsummer, all three of us were selected\nby Climate-KIC. We were taken\non a fully sponsored five week trip\naround Europe, we were taught and\ncoached by top CEO\u2019s and business\ngurus from Europe about climate\nrelated entrepreneurship, which\nbasically involved creating innovative\nbusinesses that not only make profit,\nbut are also environmentally friendly.\nBeing a Climate-KIC student allows\nus to apply to go to certain green tech\nconferences around the world, as well\nas learn and network with the cr\u00e8me\nde la cr\u00e8me in the sustainability/\nenvironment innovation field.\nOk that is really cool that you have\nbeen given business lectures and\ntravelled around Europe. What has\nbeen your favourite part so far?\nNothing beats the journey or, in\nother words, the exotic holiday,\nhaha! It consisted of 40 people with\na similar interest (working against\nclimate change); it lasted five weeks\nand three exotic countries were\nvisited (Hungary, Netherlands and\nSpain). We got treated like VIPs,\nmade some amazing friends, had one\nhell of a time and learnt all there is\nto know about green innovation and\nentrepreneurship. I don\u2019t think any\nsummer school can beat that! It was\na life changing experience, I would\nreally recommend it! Check it out on\nthe climate-KIC website. climate-kic.\norg/for-students/summer-school/\nWhat was the motivation for\nentering this programme?\nMy motivation to enter this\nprogramme was the summer journey.\nI have always been interested in\nentrepreneurship, innovation and\nsustainability; the moment I saw\nthe opportunity, I knew it was THE\nperfectly crafted summer tailored to\nmy interests!\nWhat inspired you to start a\nbusiness?\nI prefer working for myself than for\nsomebody else! Business requires hard\nwork and responsibility, but you also\nhave the opportunity to learn loads.\nFor example with an engineering\njob, I would probably only learn the\ntechnical stuff. But with my business,\nI do the technical side as well as\nhandle all of the business elements.\nMore importantly, I think it is much\neasier to contribute to society with\na start-up, as you are in the thick of\ninnovating something that solves a\ncommunity issue and makes things\nbetter for others. Imperial has great\ntalent, I would highly recommend\npeople here to consider creating a\nstart-up. You have to give a lot into it\nbut you definitely get loads out of it!\nI understand you are also organising\nTedX at Imperial. Tell me more\nabout it.\nYes, we have a committee of about\nten people. We have been working\nfor about three months now to make\nTEDxIC awesome! I have personally\nbeen involved more on the speaker\nand sponsorship side. We have\nhandpicked some amazing speakers,\nranging from inspiring youth leaders\nto big time entrepreneurs. Our theme\nis \u201cone step ahead\u201d so most of them\nwill be talking about amazing stuff\nthey have been pioneering. The event\nis on the 29th of March, tickets are\nlimited and the event is gonna be\nbrilliant. Be there or be square! http://\nwww.tedximperialcollege.co.uk/\nWhat other major projects have you\nbeen involved with in the past?\nWell I was the ex-International\nStudent\u2019s Officer at Cardiff uni. I\nhave also worked extensively with\nIslamic societies; they do some\namazing work, you have probably\nheard about Charity Week. [Imperial\nISoc raised almost \u00a370,000 last year!]\nLike WHAAA, I know! I have been\ndoing lots of debating and recently\nparticipated in LIMUN (London\nInternational Model United Nations).\nI have recently started blogging and\ndone my first blog and a series of mini\nblogs on Love.\nHow did you find being the\nInterational Students Officer (ISO)?\nI had two massive achievements! I\nlobbied the university to have a fixed\nfee policy for international students,\nso fees don\u2019t unfairly increase year on\nyear. Cardiff was the first university\nin England and Wales to accept this\npolicy, so yeah it was quite big! It will\nbe implemented this year onwards and\nwill save international students about\na million pounds over the next five\nyears! The second was campaigning\nto provide quiet rooms in every new\nbuilding that is built, so students can\npractise their faith without being\nworried about walking a kilometre or\nmissing lectures.\nWith MUN will you be taking part\nin any conferences or events?\nYes, I have managed to acquire some\nfunding to participate and represent\nImperial in the National Model\nUnited Nations (NMUN) conference\nin New York this month. I\u2019m really\nexcited about that! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll die\nbefore letting Imperial down!\nAnd what is the \u2018Love is in the air\u2019\ncampaign about?\nLove is the only infinite element\non earth and it\u2019s just sad to see how\nlittle of it we use. So I wrote a blog\ntalking about how love is not only for\nValentine\u2019s day or Mother\u2019s day, but\nfor every day. As Prophet Muhammad\n(Pbuh) said \u201clove for your brother\nwhat you love for yourself\u201d, we have\nto eliminate envy, hate, jealousy from\nour lives. One way to do this is by\nincorporating small actions of love\ntowards our neighbours, animals,\nplants, strangers, parents and so\non! To demonstrate this I did a mini\ncampaign for ten days of random\nacts of kindness. One example was\nwhere I accompanied Emma, an 85\nyear old who was walking alone to her\nhome; on the way she shared some\namusing stories from her past. More\nimportantly, talking to someone made\nher really happy! Such people deserve\nmuch better! I hope others actually get\ninspired enough from these acts and\nspread some love. Actually, you should\ncheck it out, you might like it: http://\nsheikhabdullarashid.wordpress.com/\nThat was a very impressive list of\naccomplishments, what do you\nhope to do in the future?\nMy aim in life is to do something\nthat benefits the community,\nparticularly the needy. As I mentioned\nearlier, this can be done via innovation\nand entrepreneurship and that is my\nimmediate plan. However, I think\nthe amount of work that can be done\nby being a politician is significant,\nfor example what I achieved as\nInternational Officer couldn\u2019t have\nbeen possible by being just a student.\nSo I do envision getting into Indian\npolitics and working very hard to help\nthe people! Wish me luck.\nAny last comments or\nrecommendations for Imperial\nstudents?\nBe ambitious, aim and work very\nhard for the wider good, spread love\nall around and don\u2019t worry too much\nabout happiness. Let Newton\u2019s third\nlaw work itself up: Every action has an\nequal and opposite reaction!\nThis week I interviewed Abdulla Sheikh. He is a MSc student at\nImperial who has recently started a business and is currently organising\nTedX Imperial as well as working on a number of other exciting projects.\nFace to Face with Abdulla Sheikh\nNida Mahmud\nNews Editor\n\n"
