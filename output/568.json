    "content": "definitely en route, so we repaired to the\nchanging rooms to keep warm.\nOnce the game started IC fought hard to\ngain control. Some determined attacks by the\nforwards paid off when Caroline scored, and\nagain when in typically aggressive mood\nMary went straight through the opposition's defence. (Not 'round' but 'through'!)\nUnfortunately a surprisingly fast move by\nthe Bart's forwards caught the defence out,\nand they scored.\nThe game degenerated rapidly in the\nsecond half though IC continued to play well,\nand the final whistle saw us in possession of\nour first league points. Well done everyone\nwho played.\nThanks to Jan (volunteer goalie), Jane-who\nhas not played for a few years, \u2014 and Silly,\nwho turned up to play for us at the last\nminute.\nTEAM: Jan Clarke, Cathy Crossley,\nCaroline Brown, Shirley Course, Dana\nClarke, Karen Jones, Mary Harrington, Alison\nLongstaff, Jane Wilks.\nRugby\nIC 1st XV\nIC 2nd XV\nFootball\nIC 1st XI\nIC 5th XI\nIC 6th XI\nResults and reports\nSaturday, Nov 15\nScorpions\nStallions\nSOAS\nCharing X Hosp\nUCH\n19-10\n3-13\n4-2\n6-0\n3-1\nRugby Firsts\nDUE TO the all blacks flying home early, IC\nhad to settle for Streatham Scorpions as\nopposition. IC suffered an early setback when\ntheir captain went 'on holiday', but responded\nmagnificently to the challenge. In the first half\nIC played with the wind and proceeded to\ntake the opposition to pieces without actually\nscoring any points. In a rare moment when\nhis concentration lapsed, Chandler went over\nfor a magnificent try and Morgan, slipping on\nthe wet grass, put the conversion over.\nFurther points followed from Morgan (pen)\nand some random from their team. 9-4 at half-time. Manzoni got bored so he scored a try.\nFaz, whose attempts at butting the opposition\nhad been frustrated all afternoon, also went\nover a try, leaving IC victors by 19-10.\nFootball Firsts\nHAVING made a good start to the season, 5\npoints from 3, IC 1sts have continued to make\ngood progress in the past couple of weeks.\nWe had a tough home draw in the preliminary\nround of the ULU Cup against the notorious\nteam, B.Y.E. There then followed a poor\nleague performance against Bedford drawing\n0-0. The next match was the crucial away\nfixture against LSE. IC raised their game\nsuperbly to dominate the first twenty minutes,\nlead 1:0 and missed a few good chances into\nthe bargain. We lost Elliott early on through\ninjury, but Walters de put is ed well. LSE equalise d with a dubious penalty but we\nregained the lead by half-time, thanks to\nHartland's second goal. We soaked up\npressure in the second half, but conceded a goal 2-2. In the closing stages, Bateson\nproduced a marvellously arrogant run down\nthe right and crossed for Dean to make it a deserved 3-2 win.\nOur excellent run was continued on\nWednesday when QMC were beaten 2-0, with\nMulhali producing a fine header to break the\ndeadlock. (His jump did not resemble a salmon at all.) Elliott scored the second but\nmade an enemy of Arthur by breaking the net!\nThis left us firmly on top of the league, a suitable reward for a fine start to the season.\nOn Saturday we continued our cup run with\na42 win against SOAS. We began well when\nOrgasmikov decided not to stop a forty yard\nshot in the first five minutes! We were spurred\ninto action and Smith equalise d. Twenty\nminutes from the end IC gave SOAS a penalty\nfrom which they went 2-1 up. IC once again\nproduced a characteristic surge in the closing\nstages to win 4-2. Dick scored the equalise r without ever having the ball under control!\nHartland and Rowley scored the other two to\nput us into the quarter final.\nTEAM: Okuniewski (nee Smirnoff, Organovski, Orgasmikov), Reeve, Smith, Ward,\nMulhall, Bateson, Dick, Elliott, Hartland,\nDean, Rowley.\nThanks to Walters for being sub at LSE and\nCurran for de put ising for Ward against\nQMC.\nFootball Fifths\nKICKING-OFF with the wind behind them the\nfifths quickly laid sei ge to the Charing Cross\ngoal. Though their goal led a charmed life\nearly on, Charing Cross's luck was soon\nrunning out and it was no surprise when\nArcher thundered in the rebound from a Morris shot to put the fifths ahead. Soon after\nit was 2-0 as Hardy latched onto a Audin\ncross and buried his shot in the back of the net.\nAs half-time approached the fifths went\nfurther ahead when Dhillon was sent racing\nclear, the keep r foolishly left his line and the\nDhillon chip did the rest.\nAfter half-time Charing Cross were hopeful\nof coming more into the game with the wind\nbehind them, but someone neglected to tell\nthe fifths this. The fifths doubling their work\nrate and once again started attacking. First\nHealy slotted home; then Hardy claimed his\nsecond goal when he placed a well struck\neffort into the corner of the net. The sixth goal\ncame in the dying minutes when Gohil floated\nover a cross from the left for Baldwin to volley\nhome.\nThough this was the fifths best win of the\nseason Charing Cross Hospital were also the\nstrongest team we have so far faced, and the\nmatch served to show just what uncanny\nlevels of performance the fifths can reach\nwhen stretched.\nTEAM: Brown, Audin, Gohil, Griffiths,\nCable, Morris, Archer, Hardy, Baldwin, Healy,\nDhillon.\nMOM: Brown\nFootball Sixths\nTHE GAME started ideally for the Sixths\nwhen a long ball into the UCH half was\nlobbed into the net by a defender who was\nbeing strongly pressed by Sean Davis. UCH\ntook full advantage of the wind as they\npressed for an equalise r. The Sixths were\nforced to defend in numbers but solid\ntackling from Higham, Nagle, Davies and\nBradley prevented UCH creating many\nscoring chances while Gartside, Clegg and\nTinkler tried to break UCH's monopoly in\nmidfield. Midway through the first half UCH\nequalise d and followed this with a period of\nintense pressure. Towards the end of the first\nhalf the Sixths began to break UCH's midfield\ndominance.\nThe second half began with more UCH pressure and, several times, Hampton raced\noff his line to save at the feet of oncoming\nforwards. Midway through the second half\nthe Sixths were reduced to ten men when\nJohn Nagle was taken off with a leg injury and\nwas replaced eventually by Hall. The Sixths\nbegan to threaten the UCH goal more\nfrequently and took the lead late in the\nsecond half when a curling corner from Clegg\neluded the goalkeeper allowing Hail to score\nfrom close range. A few minutes later an\nidentical corner from Cleggy was touched on\nby Chamberlain and finished off by Roche.\nThese two goals completely de moral is ed UCH and the Sixths finished the game well on\ntop to put them in the second round of the\ncup.\nTEAM: Hampton, Higham, Nagle (Hall).\nBradley, Davies, Tinkler, Clegg, Gartside,\nDavis, Roche, Chamberlain.\nSnooker\nTHIS WEEK the B team lost to a lucky A team\nin the clash of the season narrowly losing two\nframes and winning two. Bennett (Capt) lost\nthe deciding frame to Walsh. The C team lost\n3-2 to LSE. The C team are still in a commanding position in the league and look\nto be main contenders for the title this year.\nTennis\nTHE TENNIS CLUB will be showing two films\non Tuesday, Decmeber 2. Time and place in\nnext week's FELIX as they are not finalised.\nThe films are: Wimbledon 1980, a fifty minute\nreview of this year's championship with its\nclassic mens singles finals, and How To Win\nHoles By Influencing People by John Cleese,\ntwenty-five minutes of lunacy in the funniest\never golf film.\nEntry by Tennis Club membership (can join\non the door).

    "content": "Dear Marshall\nDidI get your address correct? Surely such a pretentious newspaper would be better placed in Fleet Street? I hear that a recent closure makes such a move a distinct possibility. Mrs Gi bl in and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit last Thursday evening \u2014 collating FELIX wasn't quite such a bind as we expected. Just one thing though, she has since developed a rash, and this weeks he won't be able to perform the ritual topless dance on the folding machine. In my last letter, I spoke of my intention to produce an annual magazine \u2014 The Phoenix \u2014 the trickle of contributions continues. I now have eleven poems, three articles, and four short stories \u2014\nthis is hardly sufficient material from which to select the contents of a magazine of more than four pages! Have the students of IC forgotten their English? If not, then surely they have forgotten the prize referred to in the IC Union Handbook( I wish I could!). Several friends( and a few total strangers) have shown an interest in working on the production of the magazine. This will happen at the start of the next term. In order to get them in practise for the marathon paste up ahead, I thought it would be a good idea if\nsome of the less experienced ones could serve an apprenticeship in your paste up team on FELIX. Is\nthis alright? I hope your staff don't mind. Anyway, here' s a pound, use it to suppress industrial unrest! Support Jimmy Carter' s jowls! Long live the Phoenix! Bye for now. Sean Giblin\nDear Sir\nConsidering it's the most popular pastime in Britain, fishing isn't well represented at club level a tIC( there isn't one). Anyone interested informing such a club please contact me through the internal mail. We need at least twenty people to get this thing off the ground. Carrot1: Iam trying to negotiate group membership7 a ff i1i ation of London Anglers Association. Carrot2: With twelve people we could hire a boat togo wrecking/ sea fishing from Southend early in the new year( names tome as soon as possible). Tours sincerely\nDave Kel sail Che mEn gPG Dear Mr Marshall\nFurther to the report on the Guilds Motor club Three Counties Rally in last week's FELIX, I would like to point out that a) we did not reverse into a telegraph pole, MERELY the supporting cable AND b) this happened before we indulged in our bank bouncing bout. This latter technique has been well proven during hours of intensive research at the Motor Club Scale xt ric Evenings( demonstrations available, next meeting Tuesday, December1, Mooney' s Breakfast Bar, Southside). Tours, the battered, beaten up mini clubman driver and his slightly soiled navigator. Real ID: Paul Lan chester Me chEng2 Dear Editor\nAt a special general meeting of the OS C, the cartoons in FELIX no560 were discussed. It was unanimously passed by the committee that the cartoons were highly offensive as they were blatant examples of racist attitude, prejudicial to, and slandering the character of black students. We, therefore, insist a written apology in FELIX from you for these published cartoons. Overseas Committee Dear Sir\nOn Saturday afternoon a group of IC paddlers arrived at the Canoe Cellar with the intention of taking out the Club's Canadian canoes. While getting our equipment ready we found that the Club's Canadian paddles had disappeared, so much for paddling as hoped. We were also very concerned at the disappearance of \u00a375 worth of equipment. On Sunday morning the paddles reappeared in Prince's Gardens in the hands of a raft\nra qe team. We then enquired as\nto how they had come by these paddles and were told\" Rachel gave us them!\" So the culprit was found out. We feel that his shows a great misuse of the Deputy President's power. Is anything in the Union Building safe or is the entire building and its contents at Miss S nee's disposal? We would like to point out than another C CU managed to borrow paddles by consulting with Canoe Club. They even offered to make a contribution to Canoe Club's funds. Perhaps Miss S nee would like to do the same? Tours faithfully\nE Graham( Chairman) A Crofts( Secretary) T Clark( Treasurer) Dear Sir\nFallowing the recent meeting of the Union Finance Committee, we would like to point out that in our view the Canoe Club claim was unfairly dismissed. The claim was for a mere \u00a3160 to buy a new kayak to replace two lost\non this year's summer tour. One of the reasons put forward by the UFC for the rejection of the claim was that they consider we write off too many boats on Alpine tours. Since the Canoe Club is one of the few clubs a tIC that gives its members a chance to participate in an exciting and potentially dangerous sport, we feel the loss of one or two boats a year is a small price to pay. It is interesting to note that in the eight years since its formation, the Club has produced two British Champions, Bob J oce,'an d Tim Perry. Tim also came ten that the1979 World Championships inC2 Whitewater racing. Also the Club has two members in division one of Slalom in this country and other members in lower divisions. In addition several members of the Club are going to represent London University at the British Universities Whitewater racing and slalom championships in the coming year. All this despite the fact that it is mainly a recreational club, catering for all levels of ability. At the moment we have many interested novices and unless we are able to substantially improve the club equipment this year we will lose many of them, particularly those who cannot afford their own equipment. We hope the UFC will consider our claim in a more generous light next time. Tours faithfully\nAndrew Crofts( Secretary ICC) T Clark( Treasurer) E Graham( Chairman) Dear Sir\nWith reference to the three unfortunate gentlemen who found themselves trapped in the lift of the Union Building in the\nhours of Sunday morning, may I inquire, through the columns of\nFELIX, why the shift engineers\ndid not follow the published\nCollege procedures for lift\nemergencies, by not immediately\ncalling the lift manufacturers\nengineers, as is required in the\npublished (in the lifts of Elec Eng\nfor example) procedure?\nIt would appear that, mainly\nas a cost cutting exercise, a practice has developed of College\nmaintenance stall attempting an\ninitial rescue, prior to calling in\nthe lift engineers. Whilst this may\nseem a reasonable chance to take\nunder certain circumstances, for\nexample during normal College\nhours, it cannot be considered\nacceptable when only shift\nengineers are on site, and in\neither case leads to a waste of\nvaluable time in effecting a rescue, if the lift is stuck between\nfloors as was the case on Sunday\nmorning.\nIt might be argued that calling\nthe lift engineers out on every\noccasion is an over-reaction to\nthe situation. Suffice it to say that\nby not doing so College are\nfailing to take \" all reasonable\npracticable means to safeguard\nthe health, safety and welfare of.\n. . a) 'employees' and b) 'persons\naffected by the (employers)\noperations' (Health and Safety at\nWork etc Act 1974 ss 2 and 5\nrespectively). The analogy is\nobvious, should we follow the\nCollege procedure (and the\nLondon Fire Brigades) and sound\nthe lire alarm and dial '999' in\nthe event of discovering a fire?\nTours faithfully\nIN Lacey\nMin Tech PG Dear Steve\nParking at Imperial is reaching\nabsurd heights of difficulty- Last\nMonday, November 17, during\nthe Mines Open Day, it was\nvirtually impossible to find a place to park, for us unfortunate\nH permit holders. Indeed, after a count of 80 cars in the H zone\n(11:30am) on that day I arrived\nat the following interesting car\ndistribution: only 34 cars had an\nH permit, 32 cars had no permit\nat all and 14 cars had a permit\nfor a different zone, but decided\nto park in the H zone for some\nincomprehensible reason.\nIn the midst of such chaos, the\never smiling parking attendant\nhas a formidable task. Not only\ndoes he have to regulate the flow\nof cars in the car park, but he also\nmust try and evict people who\nshouldn't be there AND at the\nsame time face the impossible job\nof finding spaces for all visitors to\nCollege (such as the Open Days\nschool visitors who caused all\nthat chaos that morning). His\ntask is made even more difficult\nPage 2 FELIX November 21, 1980\n\n"

    "content": "Puzzle Corner What' son BigD\nI am in receipt of letters from the Overseas Students and the African-Caribbean Society Committee. Their contents have been noted.\nLike many readers, I have enjoyed my heated\nexchanges with Mr Afolabi in FELIX, but alas, it\nmust now come to an end. I would like to thank Mr\nAfolabi for providing such interesting reading over\nthe past weeks \u2014 if only there were more of his\nsort around this world would be a happier place.\nTo close, I would like to extend the warm hand\nof friendship to Mr Afolabi and all of his happy\nband of friends. Down with racial prejudice, I say1, stamp it out! As for women having tits; Good God,\nSir, that's downright sexism!\nSee you around, Desmond baby!\nTwat of the Week\nBig-mouthed Ben Bourdillon (Monster) of Guilds\nhit squad fame, was recently paid to custard pie\nme. However, I was pleased to see that I have\nretained just a little an on imi ty as he hit the chap\nopposite me in the Bot Zoo tearoom. This chap\nwas not an IC student and was understandably\nannoyed. When he protested he was told: \"Don't be childish, take it in the spirit of the thing \u2014 you\ncan put it in your editorial if you like\". He couldn't, so I did.\nSecurity\nYou guessed it, nothing has happened. No, I tell\na lie, a notice has appeared on the Falmouth/\nTizard door with the dod gy door-closer, saying\n\" No Entry\". Unfortunately, no one has\nexplained why, and, of course, everyone still\nuses the door without pushing it closed behind\nthem. Still, enough about Southside, what about\nNorthside?\nVery little has been said about Northside,\nmainly because there have been few major\nincidents. Well, last week, Weeks Hall could\nhave had a serious fire, so lets concentrate on\nNorthside. A consequence of the security\ncutbacks is that Weeks, and the other\nNorthside buildings have no security guard on\nduty on alternate nights. Besides laying open\nNorthside as easy picking for burg ter s, it poses\na serious fire-risk. This was highlighted this week\nwhen a Weeks Hall resident, somewhat the\nworse for alcohol, decided to cook a meal in the\nmiddle of the night. After putting on his\nspaghetti at 3:00am, he promptly fell asleep,\nleaving the burning spaghetti to be discovered\nby the Warden Dr Monro at 4:30am. By this\ntime the smoke had filled the hall, and infact the\nthe alarm was raised by Mrs Monro, who smelt\nit on the ninth floor (the kitchen in question is\non the first!) If the chap had fancied chips, the\nincident would have given FELIX a front page\nstory, not to mention The Times!\nBy Scaramouche\nThe orchestra committee were budgeting for their\nnext concert.\n\"The only instruments we may need to hire\nplayers for are the piano, harp, harpsichord, tuba\nand percussion,\" said the Chairman. \"What are\nthe rates for hiring extra players?\"\n\"Here's the current list,\" replied the secretary,\nshowing him this table.\n\u00a3\nPiano soloist 36\nOrchestra pianist 30\nHarpie 25\nTuba player 22\nHarpsichordist 19\nPercussionist 14\n\"And don't forget that apart from hiring extras,\nwe should allow \u00a38 for printing programmes and\ntickets.\"\nThe treasurer punched the buttons on his calculator. \"With the-music we are playing at our next\nconcert,\" he said, \"we shall need a total of exactly\n\u00a3100 to cover hire of extras and printing.\"\nWhat extra players will the orchestra be need-ing?\nSolutions, comments and criticisms to me c/o FELIX Office. A prize of \u00a32 and two tickets to the\nIC Orchestra Concert for the first correct solution\nopened at noon on Tuesday.\nLast Week's Solution\nRumble started with Flirt before Quirk started with\nFlirt before Prong started with Fluff. Prong and\nRumble are pure mathematicians. Quirk is a statistician (true, false, true).\nThere were sixteen replies (twelve of them cor-rect) to a puzzle which most people felt was about\nthe right standard. Tim Lawes, Maths 3, won\n(again) and he can collect his prize from the office.\nSome people came unstuck by the unjustified\nassumption that the mathematicians comprised\n(compromised?) one pure, one applied and one\nstats. Other people were confused by Prong's second statement; this is worth a little explanation.\n\"If X then Y\" means that either X is true, in,\nwhich case Y is also true, or X is false in which case\nwe can say nothing about Y.A little thought shall\nconvince you that this is the same as saying X is\nfalse or Y is true (or both). So we can write the\ntruth table:\nXY If X then Y True True True\nTrue False False\nFalse True True\nFalse False True\nSo if the statement \"If X then Y\" is true, either X is false or Y is true or both. On the other hand, if \"If\nX then Y\" is false, then X is true and Y is false.\nI hope this makes things a little clearer!\nIC Orchestra have sent me two tickets to their\nconcert next Thursday to add to the cash prize for\nthis week's competition. The wording of the puzzle\nis to give them further publicity, and to thank them\nfor their generosity.\nPS: Noon is twelve o 'clock!\nHad there been a security guard on that night,\nhe could have either prevented it happening, or, in\nthe case of fire, have cleared the building and\ncalled the fire brigade.\nI believe that the fire risk alone justifies 24\nhour security in student ac como dati on.

    "content": "Canoe Club\nCANOE CLUB recently held a very successful\nweekend trip to the River Usk in South Wales. A party of twenty-one took part with abilities\nranging from complete beginners to expert. The\nbulk of the time was spent helping new members\nto improve their paddling. Most people make very\ngood progress and by Sunday most were able to\ntackle some more difficult water while a few\npreferred to stay on the easier stretches. We had\nvery few swimmers for such a large novice trip.\nThe trip also saw the clubs C2 in the water,\nshowing the present interest in Canadian\npaddling in the club. It is hoped that the club will\nbe able to obtain some new Canadian canoes in\nthe near future, to encourage this interest.\nCatering was up to a very high standard over\nthe weekend with an excellent chicken stew on\nSaturday evening and cooked breakfasts ready\nby 7:30 on both mornings.\nWe have two more weekend trips this term.\nThe first is to the River Dee on November 28 and\n29. This is a trip for experienced paddlers, and is\none of very few chances to get on the Dee.\nThe second is the Bude surfing trip, via Wylye.\nBig surf and fine weather are expected, giving\nideal conditions. Also our new surf ski should be\nhere by then.

However, because fairly regular matches\nat lunchtimes or weekends would cause problems\nfor a lot of players, it has been decided to delay\nthe start until the Spring when it should be\npossible to play matches in the early evening\n(around 5:00-7:00pm). It is hoped that these\nfixtures will take place at Hyde Park and each\nteam will probably play once a fortnight.\nAt the moment we have teams from Chemistry,\nGeology, Chem Eng, Metallurgy, Biochem,\nManagement Science, Environmental Technology,\nand the Department of Social and Economic\nStudies and we would team with other\ndepartments. If anybody is interested in joining in\nand would like some more information please\ncontact me in Chemistry 432, internal 4146, or\nMarcus Karoiewski in Chem Eng, internal 3774.\nIn the meantime the New Gym set up in the\nOld Chemistry Buildings (known as the\n'Volleyball Court') has been booked for post grad five-a side soccer on Tuesdays from 2:30-4:00pm. At the moment there are no regular teams; we are\njust organising games among those who wish to\nturn up. If sufficient numbers were interested,\nw ke may hold some five-a side tournaments.\nAnybody who would like to play should turn up at\nthe Volleyball Court on Tuesday afternoons.\nRobert Bird\nPG Tips\nTHE POST Graduate Dinner will be held on\nDecember 3.

What response QMC offered\nwas dealt with efficiently by the IC defence in\nwhich Drabble! making his first appearance\nfor the seconds, played exceptionally well. A much improved performance by the defence\nmeant that Steve Veats, who has played\nconsistently well in goal this season, was\nrarely troubled.\nQMC's best chance came midway through\nthe first half when a header from a corner was\ncleared from the goal-line by Saunders.\nIn the second half, IC were again finding it\ndifficult to get in shooting positions until\nMalcolm Carr was upended in the penalty box\nby the advancing keeper. Phil Niccolls cool y stepped forward to blast home the goal that\nkept him his goal a game record and gave IC\ntwo valuable points.\nTEAM: Veats, Drabble, Beer, Armstrong,\nMacDonald, Lakin, Niccolls, Clarke, Veenman,\nSaunders (Walters), Carr.\nJim Beer\nFootball Fourths\nIC STARTED the game hoping to retain their\n100% league record. After a scrappy opening\nIC went co se when Chown was unlucky to\nsee a fine header cleared off the line.\nFifteen minutes into the match McNicholas\nopened the scoring with a well taken goal\nafter a good through ball from Buckley. IC\ndominated the remainder of the half and\nshould have had a greater lead when the\nteams changed ends.\nMcNicholas scored his second early in the\nsecond half, after a goal mouth scramble. A third goal followed when Buckley ran forty\nyards unchallenged to rifle his shot into the\ncorner of the net.\nA feature of IVth's play this season has\nbeen their ability to squander a comfortable\nlead, in this case they allowed QMC to score\ntwice.\nCentre forward, Burns, settled the match\nwhen after a quickly taken free kick he found\nspace on the edge of the box to turn and\ncrash a first time shot into the roof of the net.\nTEAM: Gilbert, Berns, Maddy, Chown,\nRedmayne, Buckley, Graves, Dolwin,\nMcNicholas, Burns, Williams.\nLadies Hockey\nWE ARRIVED at Barts ground, to be met by\nthe groundsman who did not know that Barts\nLadies were playing at home!

    "content": "Theatre\nTomfoolery\nNot exactly the latest show in London, but well\nworth a visit, if you haven't already been, is\nTom Foolery at the Criterion, Piccadilly.\nA review rather than a play, the performance\nconsists of Tom Lehrer's songs, well sung by a versatile cast with excellent musical backing,\ncomp ered by the evergreen Robin Ray.\nTom Lehrer was rather a cult during the\nlater 50s, when he recorded several albums,\nwhich have sold steadily over the years,\nincluding An Evening Wasted With Tom\nLehrer and That Was The Year That Was.\nSince then, however, he has retired from the\nlimelight back to his original vocation of\nteaching maths at various institutions in the\nStates.\nHis humour is very black, and, despite its\nage, I found it very relevant and up-to-date.\nVery much a man ahead of his time. With\nC ND in the news again songs like Who's Next? is a highly relevant song about the\nspread of nuclear arms in the Third World. To\ntreat such weighty matters in such a lighthearted way may seem irreverent, but his\nsatire has the ability to penetrate even the\ncosiest of convictions. The targets for his\nlampoons come in all shapes and sizes, from\nsacred cows to secret desires, from Mary\nO 'Hara to Ronald Reagan (yes, he was around\nthen as well!), all are exposed to his\nremorseless satire.\nThe production and presentation is polished\nwith a relentless pace that makes two hilarious\nhours fly by,and leave you humming such\nfavourites as Poisoning Pigeons In The Park\nand Vatican Rag. Standby is \u00a32.90, available\nmost weekdays and a thoroughly good buy.\nLee Paddon\nSCAB Night\nTHIS ANNUAL display of the collective talents of\nSCAB took place in the Union Concert Hall last\nSaturday.\nAndy Cheyne comp ered, filling in the slots\nbetween acts with renditions of folk songs and\nsome jokes of questionable content.\nThe first band, Blue Max, had a mixed\nreception. Without the singer they sounded fairly\nreasonable, if you like that particular kind of loud\nrock; the arrival of the vocalist, however,\nsignalled a downward plunge in quality. The best\nthat can be said is that they have potential.\nThe play by Dramsoc (God, by Woody Allen)\nwas very clever; if a little pretentious in parts, and\nwas on the whole well acted. Mark Wilson and\n'Eric' Jarvis gave very competent performances in\nthe central roles, their ability to ad lib relevant\nlines provided much of the humour throughout\nthe performance. It was typical Woody Allen, full\nof superficial profundity and human neurosis. All\nin all, a well-rounded performance by Dramsoc\nand justly applauded.\nIf the next band, 'And Support', don't sort\nthemselves out a new name they'll vanish without\ntrace. They play very com pet ant ly, but without a great deal of imagination. They per sue a mid-seventies \"mood rock\" sound, but fail to achieve\nany individuality, wallowing perpetually in a mishmash of keyboard sounds. If they try some more\ninventive material, and clamp down on the\nkeyboards a bit, they should do well.\nAs for Smokestak, the audience was very good.\nThe films shown were Cook and Moore's Hound of Baskervilles; this film was in parts very\ngood, but it wasted the fine talents of the actors\nconcerned.\nErotic Inferno was mostly a jaded porno flick.\nll unt \u00a9pid re Visits fr tends The blacksmith climbed into bed with his\nyoung wife and fell almost at once into a deep sleep. It had been a hard day at the\nforge: shoeing horses, making gates, and\ndoing other things that a blacksmith has to\ndo.

Mice were a problem in\nthe village bakery: Mr Eric (strange name!)\nhad bought a cat on the strict assurance\nthat she had been \"dealt with\". This\nunfortunately was demonstrably not the case\nand after Mr Eric had given away more\nkittens than the entire village could strictly\naccommodate, he found that the best\nexpedient was to drown the poor little\nthings in the village pond when no one was\nlooking.\nPage 4 FEUX November 21, 1980\n\n"

And whatever happened to those nice old back window stickers we used to use against such' pirate' cars? John Mala th ron a sChemE n gPG Dear Sir\nTeddy Taylor's talk was an example of the un reasoned bigotry which typifies both extremes of the nuclear power debate. Underneath his rhetoric about\" the wild men\" lay four lines of argument in favour of nuclear power:1) No other alternatives are feasible.2) Nuclear power is safer than any other alternatives.3) Nuclear power is cheaper.4) Nuclear power will help the Third World. The lines1,2, and4 are all related. Taylor's arguments can be dismissed because he did not seriously consider conservation which can enormously reduce our energy demand, is safe, and would aid the Third World. He dismissed solar energy by assuming satellites were needed to collect it when Brink worth has clearly shown th t even in Britain solar heating can save30% of domestic energy consumption. Taylor also said that the CE GB' s costings for nuclear power are unchallenged. This is\nfalse. In their calculations which shows nuclear power is not cheaper than other options. When questioned Taylor seemed unable to grasp that electricity is less essential for the Third World than simple solar powered pumps and efficient wood stores. Not many people in India have colour TVs and dishwashers. Thus I feel Taylor's arguments should be rejected. His talk has not helped the energy debate by his emotional pleading and false\narguments.

She decided to take action when she was told by a student that a \u00a336 cheque had been paid to the man and that no receipt had been given. On being challenged the man insisted that he had come in response to cards sent by students living in L instead; the sub wardens asked for identification which he seemed unable to produce. The situation then became heated, with the cheque for \u00a336 being torn up. At this stage it was decided to call the police to remove the man from the premises. Sue told FELIX that she had been warned that this sort of thing has been happening at other universities, she said that any students approached by this company ought to treat any offer with extreme caution Three men in a lift\nRelief for Tim, Mark and Rod\nAt five past one last Saturday night, three happy souls entered then ion lift.

We have had one case\nof dentist prematurely putting this new regulation\ninto effect, so watch out. At the moment if your\ntreatment is not free you pay for what you need,\nup to \u00a38. The maximum cost per tooth for\ncrowns, inlays, p inlays, and gold fillings is \u00a318\nwhile the total cost for one course of treatment,\nirrespective of the number of teeth restored will\nnot exceed \u00a354. For dentures and bridges the\ncost varies between \u00a317 and \u00a350 depending upon\nthe number of teeth dealt with and the type of\nmaterial used.\nDuring the holidays, when the vacation element\nof the grant applies you may be able to get a refund, even if you don't normally qualify for free\ntreatment. To do this, ask the dentist for form\nFID which should be taken or sent to your local\nsocial security office.\nFree dental treatment is available at most of the\nLondon dental schools, carried out by students\nunder the close supervision of the registrars. Ths\nfacility is especially useful in emergencies while\nsometimes it is possible to be taken on as a regular patient. For more details about the dental\nschools and local dentists giving NHS treatment\ncall in at the Welfare Centre.\nSomething else to watch out for at the moment\nare electric slot meters set above the latest\nmaximum resale price. The charge consists of\ntwo parts. Firstly, 6.6p for each day that\nelectricity is available to the person to whom it is\nbe ng resold \u2014 a sum which should be included in\nthe rent. Secondly, the charge for each unit\nresold, which is 4.77p. Some landlords appear to\nbe including the daily charge in the price per unit\nand misunderstand the regulations seeing the\n6.6p as the unit charge.\nGas charges are fortunately rather more\nstraight forward since there is a flat rate\nmaximum. This is now 40p per the rm for slot\nmeters.\nSue Telling\nWelfare Centre\nOn the Rag\nStarting next Wednesday for one week only is a London Rag Mag Competition, further details are\non posters.

Like the men, their lives are\ncontrolled by the influx control and pass laws.\nUnderemployment is abundant amongst the men\nbut more so amongst women. The only jobs\navailable in the townships are as domestic\nservants to whites. In these cases they have to\nleave their families and live either in the home of\ntheir employer or in single sex hostels in the\ntownships where they are allowed neither male\nvisitors or children. Because of these problems\nany stable and lasting relationships are destroyed\nand impossible under the system. In Durban in\n1970s between 59-64 of every 100 African babies\nwere illegitimate and there were vast numbers of\nabandoned children belonging nowhere.\nWomen working in their traditional roles as\nsub sistance farmers in the homelands are being\ncontinually moved from one bantustan to\nanother. The women have no right to land on the\nBantustans and due to over-crowding work is\nalmost non-existent.\nBlack men and women have been detained,\nimprisoned, tortured and killed for fighting to\nhave the same rights as the whites and black\nwomen have to fight even for the limited rights\nthat black men possess.\nWomen in Science and Technology are\ndisplaying a photographic exhibition on 'Women\nUnder Apartheid' in the ICWA Lounge (third\nfloor, Union Building) until Wednesday,\nNovember 26 and anyone is welcome to come\nand see it at anytime.\nOn Wednesday, November 26 we will be\nhaving a discussion on this topic at 12:30pm in the\nICWA Lounge.

Probably most of us\nwill never meet each other. Although 'coming\nout', admitting you are gay, is perhaps easiest in a college environment, IC is an exception! Due to\nits male dominance, the majority of students here\nare hostile to the ideas of homosexuality as\nwitnessed when various anti-gay socs emerged\ncoinciding with the formation of IC Gaysoc\nthree years ago.

Meeting other gay people stops the\ntremendous feelings of isolation and loneliness\nespecially when it is discovered that few gay\npeople conform to the media roles given to us.\nOnce public about it, we may choose to copy\ncertain stereotypes, but most of us don't. If you\nare gay, you will no doubt be aware of the London\no av 'scene', a vast collection of pubs, clubs, and\ndiscos, catering for almost every taste, but if this\nto be your first step into the gay world, it can be\nvery daunting and depressing as finding groups of\nlike-minded gay people is difficult especially on\nyour own.\nIf you are gay and want to talk to someone\nabout it or find out where to go, phone Nightline\n(589-2468, between 6:00pm and 9:00am) to whom\nwe have provided a list of places we have been to,\nor come to ULU Gaysoc in Malet Street every\nThursday at 8:00pm. We will be pleased to see\nyou there. Tell someone you're from IC. You can\nalso write to me: Peter Bond c/o Nightline, 10\nPrinces Gardens.\nComing to terms with being gay can be lonely\nand difficult. Let us help make it slightly easier.\nSF Sock\nWANT TO go to Yorcon? Want to know what it\nis? Want to correct my grammar?\nCome to the SF Sock meeting on Friday,\nNovember 21 at 1:00pm in Southside Upper\nLounge, and learn wonders. Yes \u2014 Yorcon. The\nbiggest Science Fiction convention in the British\nIsles, held in Leeds between April 17 and 20, 1981.\nIf you want to go, or find out more about it, come\nto the meeting I 've already mentioned (this guy\nwould be no good on 'Just a Minute').\nAlso (as Zarathustra once said) there will be a meeting of the British Science Fiction Association\non Friday, November 21 (so many important\n,things happen on Friday). Meet us at Hammersmith tube station at 7:30pm if you want to go.\nDon't worry, we'll be conspicuous.\nOther things: Steve Higgins (Physics 1) would\nappreciate factual material for our magazine\nPerihelion: articles, reviews, damn near anything\nwill be considered (including artwork).\nItem: Astrosoc have done nothing this term; an\nat least hadn't until we used one of their posters\nto advertise Quintet. The very next day, they\nannounced a meeting. More than coincidence?\n(No \u2014 John Sladek).\nDashed off in ten minutes by\nHarry Seldon\nOneinology 2\nRed Cross\nTHE DETACHMENT are arranging for a social\nevening open to all members and friends of the\nDetachment to be held on Wednesday\nNovember 26, 1980 at 8:00pm in Topsy's Wine\nBar, 29 Battersea High Street.\nTo get there cross Battersea Bridge, take the\nfirst turning right (Battersea Church Road) to the\ntraffic lights, cross the traffic lights and Topsy's is\non your left (approx one and a half miles from\nCollege).\nThe cost of the evening, including a three-course dinner, half bottle of wine and entertainment will be \u00a35.50. Please apply to Miss CD M Collins, Room 714, Elec Eng (int 3096) for tickets.\nExternal Affairs\nTHE GOVERNMENT has already said it intends\nto change the system of student union financing\nfor next year. A few weeks ago the latest\nproposals were leaked (see FELIX, October 24)\nfrom the Department of Education and Science\n(DES). They break down into two main parts:\nA) Each student's tuition fees will be increased\nby \u00a332 to take account of student union\nsubscriptions, irrespective of whether the Union\nneeds more or less money (IC Union currently\nreceives \u00a339 per student). \u00a32.1miI lion will be\navailable to Colleges from the rate support grant\nto local education authorities to 'top up' student\nfunds, but the effect will be that of a drop in the\nocean.\nB) However, this money will be given to\ncolleges to do with as they see fit; the compulsion\nto give any money to student unions will be\nremoved from the DES guidelines. Effectively,\nstudent unions will be in direct competition with\nacademic departments, administration and\ncollege facilities for funds; colleges will be able to\ngive as little as they want to student unions.\nIf this becomes Government policy, everyone\nat IC will be directly affected. If College decides,\nor is forced to make cuts (the Government is\ncurrently looking for a Ebillion cut in public\nspending) all union facilities will be affected; clubs\nand CCUs, services and sports.\nThe DES is currently final ising the proposals\nfor publication, and hopefully changing them.\nHowever, hope is never enough, and the\nproposals will go ahead if there is little\ni protest particularly from students. With this in\n' mind, the University of London Union have\norganised a demonstration of all students for\nFriday, November 28, and IC as a constituent college will be supporting it. We will leave Beit Arch at\n10:30pm on Friday morning. It is important you\ngive your support; it will be too late to protest\nwhen the Union budget is cut.\nPhil Cole\nExternal Affairs Officer\nCARNIVAL is tonight at 7:30pm, in the Union\nBuilding. There will be five groups (the Modettes,\nthe Fix, Park Avenue, the Joy Spring Septet and\na steel band), two films (one in 3D), food, a disco,\nand a bar until 4:00am. Tickets are available from\nthe Guilds Office at \u00a33 each.\nHit Squad closes today at 5:30pm. You have\none last chance to put a contract on someone and\nthey will not have time to get you back!\nYear Rag Collection is on Saturday, November\n29. Start thinking about ideas for your Rag stunt,\nand see your social rep.\nAndy Dixon\nC&G Publicity Officer\nFEU X November 21, 1980 Page 9\n\n"
