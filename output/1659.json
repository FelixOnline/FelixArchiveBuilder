(I knew\nI should never have given them my college ID, but how did\nthey guess my password was Ilikespankings?). Unfortunately,\nthe policy that would have allowed me to pull out has lapsed,\nand I am now the only candidate for junior assistant council\nquorum counter. However, I am not ready for such a responsi-bility. I fear responsibility so badly, I ran out of home the day\nI was given control over my allowance. I despise it so much, I\ntake a baby-sitter to ACC night. But I like curly fries too much\nto flee Imperial and start a new life as a Peer of the House of\nLords. What should I do?\nSincerely,\nTom Floyd\nDear Floyd,\nI think I met your baby sitter at an ACC!\nArguably, I do not remember everything,\nbut you chose her well: she facesitted on my\nbabyface, and it was amazing. I ended up\nthrowing up my liquid intake of the night, but\nshe had thankfully gotten off me (and gotten\noff in general) by then. Anyway, I should\nreally find something that holds to the stomach\nbetter. Maybe those new pre-pulled pints will\ngo down better, since they lack the fizz.

Talking to\n\u201cThe fader\u201d, Stormzy said he\nused this track to \u201cdeal with\nall these people chatting shit\u201d.\nHe wanted the album to start\nlike a \u201cpunch in the face\u201d; and\nit did.\nOne thing is very clear from\nthis album, Stormzy has three\nmain pillars in his life to lean\non when he\u2019s struggling or\nfeeling low: his friends/ family\n(his heart-warming admiration for his mum in particular\nis evident throughout the\nalbum), his girlfriend, and\nGod. When he\u2019s not spitting\nvenomous bars aimed at\nanonymous paigons who\nhave pissed him off, Stormzy\ndedicates the rest of this\nalbum to them. Tracks like\nVelvet/ Jenny Francis (Inter-lude) and Cigarettes and\nCush sound like an extended\nlove letter to his girlfriend and\nhe even raps about marriage\non 21 Gun Salute. 100 bags\nis a truly wonderful track,\nthe sort of track that will melt\nfans\u2019 hearts and make them\nwant to call their mums just\nto say \u201cI love you\u201d. It begins\nwith a voicemail message\nfrom his mum, praying that\nhe had a blessed day. Myself\nand every other Ghanaian\ncan probably attest to receiving a similar message. Finally,\nStormzy\u2019s dedication to his\nChristian faith it is abundantly\nclear throughout the album.\nHe raps on Velvet/ Jenny\nFrancis (Interlude), \u201cThe boys\nwanna tease at my faith /\nThat\u2019s just another reason to\npray\u201d. Stormzy is a UK version of Chance The Rapper:\nThey\u2019re the same age, they\u2019re\nboth absolutely winning right\nnow, they both seem to be\nwell-grounded characters,\nuniversally liked by their\npeers in the music industry,\nand both are unafraid to\nremain independent and use\ntheir music to shine a light on\ntheir faith and their relationship with God.\nIt\u2019s difficult to categorise this\nalbum and that is a testament\nto Stormzy\u2019s versatility as an\nartist. It is a grime album in\nthe loosest sense of the term\nand you can\u2019t help but feel\nO\nver recent\nyears, the UK\ngrime and\nurban scene\nhas had a\nrenaissance\nand one man has been at the\nforefront of this wave \u2013 the\nWickedSkengMan live in\nthe flesh, Stormzy (Michael\nOmari Jr.) In addition to his\nraw musical talent, Stormzy\u2019s\nomnipresence on social\nmedia: uploading daily\nSnapchat stories, tweeting\nregularly, and releasing\nviral videos (the Stormzy\nhype reached its peak with\nthe Shut Up video, which\npropelled him to 8th\nplace\nin the Christmas 2015 UK\nSingles charts), has led to\nhim generating such a large\nglobal fan base. Stormzy\nhad emerged as the \u2018chosen\none\u2019 of the new wave of\ngrime artists and, to justify\nthis hype, he simply had to\ndeliver a hard-hitting debut\nalbum. The pressure was on,\nand at the tail-end of 2016,\nStormzy went AWOL. He deactivated all his social media\naccounts and cancelled all\nbut one of his remaining live\nshows, seemingly to finish\nhis highly anticipated album.\nAfter a few months of silence,\nStormzy\u2019s social media\nstarted flickering back to life\nand he launched a mysterious\nbillboard campaign across\nLondon. The release of the\nalbum\u2019s lead single Big For\nYour Boots soon followed.\nAnnouncement of a UK tour\n(now sold out) and a string of\nsurprise performances later,\nincluding joining Ed Sheeran\non stage at the Brits to\nperform a remix of Sheeran\u2019s\nBy Andy Djaba\nthat this was intentional. In\na recent interview with the\nGuardian, Stormzy stressed\nthat he wants the same\nrespect as artists like Frank\nOcean or Adele. In other\nwords, Stormzy is not here\nfor the critics that want to\nput him in the box of \u201cgrime\nartist\u201d. He is an artist in the\ntruest sense of the word and\nthis album is a beautiful blend\nof genres that betrays the\nfact that Stormzy\u2019s artistry is\ninfluenced by a wide range of\nmusic. Listeners can tell that\nevery detail of this album has\nbeen meticulously planned,\nfrom his flawless return to\nthe scene and the build-up\nto its release, to the choice\nof guest artists who enhance\nevery track that they\u2019re\nCroydon mentioned bible\nverses in a bar (\u201cBrother, I\u2019m\ngood, I stay with the lord /\nBible carrier, that\u2019s my sword\n/ Matthew 12, so I don\u2019t\ntalk / John 19\u2019s why I never\ngot caught\u201d) that I actually\nopened it. With this album,\nStormzy somehow found a\nway for \u2018gospel-grime\u2019 to\nmake sense.\nOn the final track, Lay Me\nBare, we see Stormzy at his\nmost vulnerable as he gives\nus an insight into his constant\nbattle with his own demons.\nHe addresses the resentment\nhe still holds towards his\nabsent father and further\ndetails his struggles with\ndepression and his faith. On\nthe last track in particular,\nStormzy has humanised the\nstereotype of the \u2018angry black\nman\u2019.\nSomething I found particularly inspiring is Stormzy\u2019s\ncall to action for \u2018young black\nKings\u2019. His message is simple,\n\u201cif you want something, just\ngo and fucking do it\u201d, and\nhe\u2019s leading by example\nby remaining independent\nand launching his #Merky\nlabel. As Stormzy describes\nit, \u201cblack people have been\ngetting twanged for the longest\u201d. Stormzy has recognised\nthe influence he currently has\nover younger generations\nand has used his position\nand responsibility to prove\nthat a group of young black\nboys can be successful. On\na lighter note, Stormzy also\nmade dark skin sexy again,\nand for that I\u2019ll always be\ngrateful. The release of this\nalbum feels like it could be\na very big moment for the\ngrime scene, similar to how\nDizzee Rascal\u2019s Boy in da\nCorner album was important\nfor the genre. Time will tell if\nCrazy Titch\u2019s prediction that\nStormzy\u2019s \u201cabout to take it\n[grime] from a second rate\ngenre to a first rate genre\u201d\nwill come true. I can\u2019t help but\nagree with Ghetts, who ends\nhis verse on Bad Boys (my\npersonal favourite track on\nthe album and one which references the legendary Bashy\nvs. Ghetts clash) with \u201cIt was\nall calm before Stormzy /\nNow it\u2019s lightning\u201d.\nfeatured on. We\u2019re treated to\nsmooth, jazzy production on\nCigarettes and Cush, gospel\non Blinded By Your Grace\nand we hear him sing over a\nchopped and screwed sample\nof Nao\u2019s Intro (Like Velvet) on\nVelvet/ Jenny Francis (Inter-lude). Of course, the album\nalso has plenty of bars and\nhigh-energy grime bangers,\nlike Cold and Return of the\nRucksack. With its hook,\n\u201cDickhead yute and a dick-head crew / Getting gassed\nup by your dickhead friends\u201d\nand bars like, \u201cMum, if you\u2019re\nlistening, close your ears /\nBut tell them paigons suck\nmy dick / I\u2019ve had enough\nof them, they all piss me off\u201d.\nMr. Skeng in particular makes\nme want to slap a dickhead\nin the face and pray for him\nafter. I have to admit that my\nparents tell me to read my\nbible everyday but it wasn\u2019t\nuntil a 6\u20195\u2019\u2019 grime artist from\n\\\\ It begins with a\nvoicemail message\nfrom his mum,\npraying that he\nhad a blessed day.\nMyself and every\nother Ghanaian can\nprobably attest to\nreceiving a similar\nmessage \\\\\nnumber one banger Shape\nof You, and Stormzy\u2019s debut\nalbum is finally here.\nStormzy begins the album\nby getting a few things off his\nchest on the opening track,\nFirst Things First. Using his signature aggressive flow over\na raw, dark beat, Stormzy\naddresses a number of issues,\n\\\\ The pressure\nwas on, and at the\ntail-end of 2016,\nStormzy went\nAWOL \\\\\nBonobo\nat O2\nAcademy\nBrixton\nBy Philipp Antonas\nT\nhis was a gig that,\ndue to Bonobo\u2019s\nincredible talent\nand sense of sound,\nengendered awe\nthroughout the\npacked venue, however the\noccasion was let down by\nthe poor sound setup at the\nAcademy.\nAs you walked in, the depth\nof the bass notes was clear by\nthe vibrating felt throughout\nthe corridors as I waited to\nhand in my jacket, eager\nto join the crowd and get\nready for Bonobo (Simon\nGreen). Being the tour for\nhis new album Migration,\nhe opened up with several\nclass tracks such as Bombro\nKoyo Ganda and No Reason.\nWith the drops of the songs\nblasting throughout the crowd\nand the light show offering\nstunning visuals alongside the\nprojected panels of pictures\nand bright, trippy artwork,\nit was easy to get absorbed\ninto the music and the crowd\nand dance along to the beat\nheavy music.\nAs he played through his\nset, throwing in other classics\nfrom his previous albums\nincluding Cirrus, Kong and\nKiara, each new song was\nmet with a wave of euphoria\namong the crowd and cheering all around. Everyone\ngot drawn into each song,\nevery one of her songs.\nThis, however, is where I felt\nthe venue let the gig fall a tad\nshort. As was the case last\nyear when I saw Chet Faker\nhere; the vocals seemed to\nbe drowned out by the instrumentals for the most part,\nwith the mids sounding flat,\nand barely carrying across to\nthe back of the venue.\nBonobo is a unique artist\nthat records his music with\ninstruments and produces\nit electronically. It was\ninteresting to see how this\nwould be applied to a live\nperformance, especially with\nthe less instrumental-heavy\nMigration album. However,\nBonobo did not disappoint,\nperfectly replicating his music\nonstage, while not only keeping on par with the sound of\nhis tracks, but improving upon\nthem, with impeccable transitions between them.\nT\nhe venue\u2019s facade\nwas bright and\nfairly minimalist,\nwith white walls and\na simple entrance.\nInside, we were\nsurprised to hear techno\npumping out of the solid\nsound system in front of us.\nI looked around, noting the\nroyal blue walls decorated\nby gold baroque detailing;\nthe interior felt both modern\nand antiquated. Two tiers of\nbalconies encompassed the\ndance floor and stage, giving\na vaudeville vibe. We learned\nthat the source of the techno\nwas Heathered Pearls (Jakub\nAlexander), who was opening\nfor Tycho. The two have a\nclose working relationship:\nboth are signed to Ghostly\nInternational, with Jakub\ndoing A+R for them too,\nall while managing Tycho,\nand curating his artwork\non the ISO50 blog (Tycho\u2019s\nmoniker as an artist). His set\nwas neat and built nicely,\ninjecting some movement\ninto the audience. He joked\nto the fledgling crowd about\npermitting him to play techno\nat 8pm, before introducing\nTycho and leaving.\nThe mood rose in response,\nas the stalls steadily filled up\nwith people. Brought closer\nto the stage by the influx, the\nfamiliar gig funk of stale beer\nand farts began to emanate\nfrom the spectators. As you\nwould expect for IDM, a\nlabel I hesitate to use for its\npretentious connotations, the\ncrowd was mostly male and\nbespectacled, but there was\nstill an interesting mix of styles\n\u2013 from new wave dreadlocks\non my left, to close fades and\nmuscle shirts on my right.\nTycho (Scott Hansen), has\nbeen accompanied by a full\nband on tour since 2010,\nincluding Zac Brown on guitar\nand bass, Rory O\u2019Connor on\ndrums, and Joe Davancens\non bass guitar and keyboard.\nAfter a brief introduction, the\nband launched into their set.\nBeginning with the grungier,\nbass and drum heavy, new\nalbum, Epoch, they worked\nbackward through their\ndiscography. Stand out tracks\nincluded Awake, Dive and\nPast is Prologue, the titular\ntracks from their respective\nalbums. Scott credited Roni\nSize and the Bristol Drum &\nBass scene as musical influences for Past is Prologue,\nhis \u201cfirst attempt at Drum &\nBass\u201d. Much praise is due\nfor Rory\u2019s heroic effort on\ndrums. Tycho\u2019s vision as\nISO50 was felt throughout\nthe performance, with a\nvideo backdrop showing\nscenes of natural beauty,\nfamily, ceremony, and the\nfemale form, an often-double\nexposed waking dream. It felt\nlike insight was given into the\nnature of the band, with the\nreverse chronological movement from their latest album\nto their eldest contrasting the\nmusical development of each\nsuccessive release. As each\ntrack ended, the spell over\nthe crowd would be broken\nand voices would bubble up\naround us. Truly an immersive\naudiovisual experience.\n\\\\ Philipp Antonas\n\\\\ Electric Brixton\nTycho at\nElectric\nBrixton\nmesmerised by the talent on\nstage. Bonobo doesn\u2019t just hit\nthe decks and mix his songs\nfor the crowd to listen to, but\nmeticulously takes time to\noffer a performance; playing\nthe guitar himself, alongside\nother band members and a\nvocalist, who\u2019s notes carried\nbeautifully across the arena in\n\\\\ Each new song\nwas met with a\nwave of euphoria\namong the crowd \\\\\nBy Theo Farah\n\n"

    "content": "Friday 3 March 2017 31\nmillennials.felix@ic.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk/millennials\nfelix\nM I L L E N N I A L S\nSEX\nEnter the kink | BDSM 101\nF\nollowing the election\ntheme, today I\u2019m\ngoing to talk about\nrelinquishing control\nof yourself to\nsomeone who you\ndeem trustworthy enough not\nto cause permanent damage\nto your well-being. Welcome\nto BDSM 101.\nThere\u2019s been a fair bit of\npress around BDSM since the\nrelease of those Fifty Shades\nof Grey books. There\u2019s been\na fair bit of backlash from the\nB.C. Maile\nI\u2019m into all of it a little bit really. I like shibari (Japanese artistic\nrope bondage) and I\u2019m a bit of a sadist at heart. I take a dominant role. I\u2019ve subbed in the past but it\u2019s not really my thing.\nI\u2019m also into most of it, but I\u2019m a full on sub. My main thing is\nfull-body restraint. I like being completely unable to move and\nparticularly being suspended from something. I\u2019m also quite into\nelectro play.\n\\\\ It\u2019s\nimportant that\nafter a session is\nfinished, everyone\ninvolved feels\nrespected and\nsafe \\\\\nSo first off, what are you two into when it\ncomes to BDSM?\nI\u2019ve got a nice silk rope set, a couple of whips, a riding crop, a spanking\npaddle, some nipple clamps and a spreader bar (attaches to the ankles and\nwrists to keep the legs spread apart)\nI\u2019ve got quite a collection so I\u2019ll just list it and you can explain what the\nthings are. I\u2019ve got a sleepsack (basically a full body straightjacket), ropes,\na suspension frame (to hang the sleepsack from), a paddle, several leather\nand rubber hoods, spreader bars, weights to hang on the balls, an elec-trostim buttplug and and electrocock cage (they shock your bits).\nDo you have equipment for this?\nI wouldn\u2019t really say I have one. I get to live out most of mine so I\nlike a mix really. Most of them involve pretty rope arrangement\nthough. Google shibari and you\u2019ll see what I mean.\nI think my number one fantasy is to be suspended in a sleepsack,\ngagged, with an electro butt plug and electro pads on my dick,\nwhile someone else controls the power dial.\nWhat\u2019s your number one fantasy?\nWell it\u2019s hard to pin one thing down but I definitely find the control very\nhot. Teasing and playing right on the edge of peoples\u2019 limits is a huge\nturn on for me. I guess it\u2019s just really exciting.\nI just love the complete forfeiture of control. It\u2019s hard to explain\nwhy without getting too Freudian. As for the pain side, I think all\nsensory extremes are quite deeply connected. That uncertainty\nof whether a feeling is pleasurable or painful is just so exciting to\nme.\nWhat do you like about BDSM?\nAny advice for those wanting to try it\nout?\nConsent! Consent and trust are the big things here. It\u2019s important that you\nstart slowly, and establish your partner\u2019s comfort zone before you start to\npush beyond it. When you finally do, push gently, and remember the importance of aftercare.\nI second that. Aftercare is a big thing. It\u2019s important that after a session is\nfinished, everyone involved feels respected and safe.\nAnd that concludes our interview! I\u2019d just like to highlight that last\npoint. Consent and trust really are the most important things in any\nencounter, and it seems that is why Fifty Shades received such\na bad reaction from the BDSM community. BDSM is not about\nabuse, it\u2019s about mutually-enjoyed, exciting sexual experiences.\nFor that reason, I\u2019d recommend you leave that book on your\nmum\u2019s bedside table, and learn about BDSM from pros like Hamisha and Hamish. I hope that\u2019s been somewhat enlightening. See\nyou next week!\nBDSM community about these\nbooks, the majority of which\nsuggests that it is not really a\nbook about BDSM at all; it\u2019s\njust abuse-themed masturba-tory material for your mum. I\ncan\u2019t really comment as I only\ngot halfway through before I\ngot bored, but what I can do\nis give a little insight into what\nBDSM is all about.\nBDSM stands for bondage,\ndomination, and sado-mas-ochism. They are all quite\ndifferent things, but certainly\nhave a lot of overlap, so\npeople who are into one of\nthem tend to be into a few\nif not all of them. Whilst I\u2019m\nsure most readers will know\nwhat they mean, I\u2019ll outline it\nanyway just in case.\nBondage: bondage is a\nblanket term for practices\nrelating to restraint of the\nbody and sensory depri-vation. This can go from\nfurry handcuffs, ropes and\nblindfolds anywhere up to\nfull-body straitjackets and\ngags.\nDomination: This is more\nof a vague one, and there\u2019s\nnot too much to say on it.

Created\nby the minds over\nat genDESIGN\n(previously Team ICO), it\nbears a striking resemblance\nto both of their previous\ngames, Ico and Shadow\nof the Colossus. In Ico you\nplayed a boy guiding a\nhelpless young girl through\na castle in an attempt to\nescape, while Shadow\nof the Colossus tasks you\nwith finding and killing 16\nmonstrous beasts. Despite\nbeing so different, the two\ngames seem intrinsically\nlinked and The Last Guardian\nseems to be a marriage of\nthe two, as you partner with\na massive beast to escape a\nruined castle.\nIt all begins as you, a young\nboy, awaken in a dark, damp\ncave with a giant creature\nnamed Trico imprisoned at\nyour side. Before you learn\nanything about the beast or\nthe situation you find yourself\nin, you are compelled to free\nhim and nurse him back to\nhealth in an act of empathy\nand kindness that goes on to\ndefine the entire game. As\nyou interact with Trico, you\nnotice that he has spears\nlodged in the gaps of the\nand beast is the driving force\nof the entire game; Trico is\nyour only means of dispatching the eerie, ghost-like suits\nof armour that hunt you, and\ntime and time again you must\nplace your life in his ability\nto do so. On the flip side, the\nboy can progress to areas\nwhere Trico cannot, open\npassages to move further, and\nbring back barrels of food to\nnurse Trico back to health.\nTrico is the real star of\nthe game. He is incredibly\ndetailed, and seems to be\nan amalgamation of several\ndifferent creatures. His\nfeathers ruffle individually in\nthe wind, and he is incredibly\nexpressive; his facial expressions and body language tell\nyou a lot about any situation\nyou are in. His eyes change\ncolour when he is angry, he\nwill look at you with wide\neyes and tilt his head when\ncurious, and he will sit on his\nhind legs and make plaintive\ncries when he can\u2019t find\nyou. He gets injured and\nheals slowly as you progress\nthrough the story; any spears\nyou leave lodged in him will\nstay there throughout the\nentire game. Trico truly feels\nalive. When you look into his\neyes after you\u2019ve managed\nto escape a particularly dangerous situation, you don\u2019t\nsee the code or the artificial\ncharacterisation that defines\nmost video game characters.\nYou see an honest portrayal\nof an intricate, living thing.\nThe controls are incredibly\narmour, and is shackled by a\nmetal collar. After attempting to help by removing the\nfirst spear, he does not take\nkindly to your presence and\nlashes out, knocking the boy\nunconscious. However, your\ncontinued efforts to help after\nyou awaken eventually pay\noff; the spears are removed,\nthe collar is unlocked and his\narmour falls to the ground.\nThe creature is freed, and thus\nyour journey begins.\nAt first, Trico is wary and\n\\\\ The bond\nbetween boy and\nbeast is the driving\nforce of the entire\ngame \\\\\nBoy\u2019s best friend, a weird, Griffin-like monster \\\\ genDESIGN and Sony Interactive Entertainment\nThe Last Guardian is out on\nthe Playstation 4\nonly tentatively aids the boy\nin traversing the landscape,\nand needs to be coaxed into\nhelping by using food barrels\nthat are found lying around.\nHowever, this relationship\nslowly builds until the boy is\nable to give basic commands,\nand eventually the pivotal\nmoment arrives when you\nmust trust Trico with your life,\nas you jump off a platform\nhoping he will catch you as\nyou plummet into the abyss\nbelow. Near the end of the\nstory this bond is so great that\nTrico actively nuzzles the boy\nwith his head, and is greatly\ntroubled when he can\u2019t see\nyou. The bond between boy\n\\\\ You don\u2019t see the\ncode or the artificial\ncharacterisation that\ndefines most video\ngame characters \\\\\nstrange; they feel tactile, yet\nalso rather clunky. The buttons are mapped to directions\nmeaning triangle is jump\nand X is crawl, taking after\nShadow of the Colossus and,\ngenerally, older Japanese\ngames. There\u2019s a heft involved\nin every action you perform,\nas the boy struggles noticeably to pick up barrels and\nclimb ledges, making every\naction feel more meaningful.\nThe camera is also incredibly\nfrustrating at times, seeming\nto not work very well at all in\nclose-quarters.\nI realise that these flaws will\nbe more than enough to make\npeople pass this game up, or\nat least will massively affect\ntheir enjoyment. However,\nthe bond you build with Trico\nfeels natural and organic,\nand its execution is sublime.\nAs the game drew to its close,\nthis unspoken bond far outweighed any of the flaws I felt\nthe game had and because\nof this, I truly believe The Last\nGuardian one of the best\ngames of the past decade.\n\n"

I\u2019ve met with\ndepartment heads, administrators and\neven Martin Lupton himself,\nCandidate Manifestos: ICSMSU President\nand yet no solution is forthcoming.\nHow many more issues like this have\nbeen abandoned halfway through this\nprocess? How many boring lectures,\nterrible courses and mismanaged\nprojects still exist because a student\ncouldn\u2019t reach the right people? Enough\nis enough. I promise to implement 3\nmain solutions from my very first day as\npresident:\n1) Weekly Meetings between myself and\na cross section of ICSM students. I will\nvisit Imperial sites and have lunch with\nany student who wants to discuss any\nproblem they are facing, large or small.\nMarinos Ioannides 2) Monthly Meetings with the leaders\nof all major clubs within ICSM to tackle\nthe issues facing societies promptly and\ndeal with them efficiently.\n3) Termly Open Forum with the Senior\nFaculty.

That\u2019s why I\u2019m running\nfor President.\nMy past two years on ICSMSU\nhave given me the experience and\nknowledge to thrive in this role.

Our\nstrong community spirit is matched\nonly by the hard work all of our students\nput in, and I want to make sure you\nget the recognition you deserve for\nthat. I want to be your next president\nso that together we can take ICSM into\nthe modern world whilst preserving\nthe history and traditions that make us\nproud to say we are part of ICSM.\nEducation. I will empower students\nthroughout their degree by offering\nmore student choice modules. This will\ndeliver a course tailored to your specific\ninterests right from the start.\nWelfare. By offering personal tutor\nsystems based at Charing Cross, at a\ntime that suits you, I will ensure that our\nwelfare and personal tutor provision is\neasily accessible.\nClubs and Societies.

And don\u2019t forget......\nVOTE RHYS!\nDespite the Council being a crucial\nbranch of the student union, it remains\nsomewhat underrepresented. The\nCouncil is the democratic medium\nfor ordinary students to propose and\nvote for union policies. The Chair is\nresponsible for governing the flow\nof information between the Council\nand the Officer Trustees. However,\nthe current lack of awareness and\nintimidating atmosphere of Council\nmeetings does not facilitate appropriate\nrepresentation of the student body.\nAs Chair, I would strive to reshape the\nCandidate Manifestos: Council Chair\nstructure of the council and improve\nthese limitations. I\u2019ve been the\nAcademic Representative of my\ncourse for the past two years and was\na member of the Student Council in\nmy school for four. I believe that these\npositions have given me appropriate\nexperience in voicing the opinions of\nthe student population to authority\nfigures. If elected, I would deal with the\nproblem of intimidation by bridging\nthe gap between the student body and\nthe Council. In order to achieve this, I\nsuggest putting in place a simple and\nanonymous platform for students to\npropose their motions. Additionally, I\nRoy Tal Dew would conduct meetings in smaller\ngroups to create a more open\natmosphere where students could\nmore comfortably approach council\nmembers. I believe that these changes\nwould incentivise input across the entire\nuniversity rather than being restricted to\nthe loudest voices.\nLastly, I hope to raise awareness about\nthe Council by advertising important\ninformation on social media, such as\nFacebook. I\u2019m confident this would\nprovide the average student with a\nbetter understanding of union policy-making.\nCouncil is a part of the Union known\nby relatively few and understood\nby fewer, yet it is one of the most\nimportant bodies involved in running\nthe Union, so it is important to pick\nthe right candidate for Chair. I am\nan experienced member of Council,\nand have seen first-hand the positive\nchanges which it can implement when\nit\u2019s working well. However, there have\nbeen problems; as an Ordinary Member,\nI proposed reforms aiming to improve\nthe way Council works. Despite being\nwell-received by a majority present,\nthe paper was sent to a \u2018working\ngroup\u2019 and quickly forgotten. This year,\ndespite being off-campus on a year\u2019s\nplacement, I have remained active\nin its process, co-authoring a pair of\npapers again trying to improve Council\u2019s\nprocedures so it can do good work\nfor every student at Imperial. These,\ntoo, were sent to working groups\nand forgotten. As Council Chair, I will\nimprove the effectiveness of Council by:\n1. Pushing on with positive changes to\nUnion structures to make sure everyone\nis properly represented\nOwen Heaney 2. Fostering communication between\nCouncil and the Trustee board through\nregular reports of the activities of each\nto the other\n3. Improving the visibility of Council in\nthe wider student body by publishing\ndetails of meetings in the most\nprominent place possible and getting\nwork out when an important decision is\ndue to be made.\nYou will not find anyone more\ncommitted to improving the Union\u2019s\nstructures than me.

While they\nhave performed in London\nbefore \u2013 at the Royal Opera\ndistinct gender roles, but as\nthe performance goes on the\nboundaries between male\nand female become increasingly blurred, culminating in\na powerful ending where the\ntwo genders \u201cunite into one\nsingle breath\u201d.\nThe second piece was The\nListening Room by Clinkard,\na British choreographer.\nIts concept is quite unique\n\u2013 the dancers interpret a\nsoundtrack that they hear\nthrough noise-cancelling\nheadphones, while the\naudience listens to a different\ntrack entirely. As Steve Reich\u2019s\ninstrumentals filled the hall, I\ncould almost deceive myself\nthat the energetic dancing\non stage was to the same\nbeat. Then the audience\u2019s\nsoundtrack abruptly switched\noff. Despite the utter silence,\nthe dancing on stage continued as though nothing\nhad happened. It was then\nthat I realised the disconnect\nbetween the dancers and the\naudience. It was as though\nthe music was visible only\nthrough the movements of\nthe dancers; watching their\nfree interpretations, I found\nmyself trying to guess what\nkind of music they were really\nlistening to.\nFinally, the evening\nconcluded with a piece by\nC\u00e9spedes, the company\u2019s\nown in-house choreographer:\nMatria Etnocentra. The piece\nis something of a tribute to\nCuban identity \u2013 the regimented daily life combined\nwith the verve and energy of\nthe country\u2019s inhabitants. Military drill-inspired formations\ndominate the first section; the\nregularity of the marshalled\nconfigurations contrasts with\na later section, in which the\ndancers pound their clenched\nfists against their hearts. Is this\na form of social commentary\nby C\u00e9spedes? The dancers\nClaire Chan\nDanza Contempor\u00e1nea de\nCuba was on at the Barbican\non the 23rd\nFebruary\nDanza Contempor\u00e1nea de Cuba's production of Theo Clinkard's The Listening Room\n\\\\ Adolfo Izquierdo\nrun off stage for a nostalgic,\nyearning solo dance by Iosmaly Ordo\u00f1ez, who then dons\na modern outfit to join the rest\nof the troupe in a lively finish\nwith Cuban salsa rhythms.\nCuban energy runs through\nthe three performances\nlike a thread. In Reversible\nand Matria Etnocentra, the\nchoreography is designed\nspecifically with the company\u2019s background in mind. In\nReversible, \u201cthe concept of\ngender and soul is universal\u201d\nbut the dancing, especially\nthe bachata sequences, are\nparticularly Cuban; in Matria\nEtnocentra, the entire concept\nof the piece revolves around\nthe social context of Cuba.\nEven in The Listening Room, a\npiece with very little direction\nfrom the choreographer, it\nshows through in the dancers'\nown interpretations of the\nmusic.\nMore than the Cuban\nstyle it brings to the stage,\nDanza Contempor\u00e1nea de\nCuba is by all standards a\nstellar dance company. The\nthree pieces showcase the\n24 dancers\u2019 versatility and\ntechnical excellence. Every\nmove is executed with fluidity\nand feeling, and they bring\na warmth and physicality to\nthe stage which is infectious\n\u2013 from the grins on their\nfaces to the foot-stamping,\nhand-clapping sequences\nthey spontaneously break out\ninto while taking their bows.\nTruly an outstanding com-pany, one I hope to see back\nin London soon!\n\\\\ Even in The\nListening Room,\na piece with very\nlittle direction from\nthe choreographer,\nthe Cuban energy\nshows through in\nthe dancers' own\ninterpretations of the\nmusic \\\\\n\\\\ Cuban energy\nruns through the\nthree performances\nlike a thread \\\\\nHouse, Sadler\u2019s Wells, and\nthe Coliseum \u2013 this is their\nfirst time on the Barbican\nstage. This tour sees them\nshowcasing three completely\nnew pieces from award-winning choreographers\nAnnabelle Lopez Ochoa,\nTheo Clinkard, and George\nC\u00e9spedes.\nThe evening opened with\nOchoa\u2019s Reversible. Choreographed specifically for\nDanza Contempor\u00e1nea de\nCuba, Ochoa\u2019s work deals\nwith ideas of gender, seduc-tion, and rivalry, with both\nthe male and female dancers\ngoing topless at various\nparts of the choreography.\nIn addition to the soundtrack\n\u2013 sometimes drumbeats,\nsometimes sibilant whispers,\nsometimes pure silence \u2013 this\nadds to the primal, almost\nmystical, quality of the piece.\nIn one section, sensuality is\nconveyed beautifully through\nbachata rhythms and graceful\nhip movements. Ochoa\nalso playfully interchanges\ntraditional gendered clothing:\nthe male dancers wear skirts\nand the female dancers wear\ntrousers. It works surprisingly\nwell. The piece starts out with\nthe dancers expressing two\nG\noing into the\nNational\nTheatre\u2019s\nproduction of\nShakespeare\u2019s\nTwelfth Night,\nI was expecting a slightly\nless-conventional production.\nI was not wrong. Director\nSimon Godwin is certainly\nnot afraid to show us that\nthis is a modern play from\nthe off, with a flashy display\nof a shiny car cruising onto\nthe stage piled with Orsino\n(Oliver Chris) and his dapper\nentourage. One lady I spoke\nto noted that the production\nwas \u2018unorthodox\u2019, which is\nsaying something, considering\njust how outrageous the\noriginal play is in terms of the\nthemes it addresses: much\nof Twelfth Night\u2019s charm can\nbe attributed to its storyline,\ncentring around classic\ncases of mistaken identity\nand complicated, mutating\nlove polygons, of which\nShakespeare is undoubtedly\na master of.\nThe name of the play itself\nrefers to the last night of\nChristmas, on which ridicule is\nsupposed to ensue \u2013 husbands swapping roles with\nwives and so forth. It is perhaps appropriate therefore,\nthat the most striking addition\nto this production is Malvolio\u2019s replacement by Tamsin\nGreig\u2019s Malvolia, cementing\nthis production\u2019s status as a\nvery modern take on a play\nthat itself was well ahead of\nits time \u2013 not only due to the\nmore modern costumes and\nscenery, but also in the extent\nto which it thrusts the play\u2019s\nideas about gender roles into\nthe limelight. The recasting\nof Malvolio as Malvolia \u2013 a\nwoman played by a woman\n\u2013 has a fitting parallel in\nthe times of Shakespeare,\nin which men would have\nplayed the female roles. This\nis perhaps an attempt by\nGodwin to show how society\nhas evolved: gender identity\nis becoming more and\nmore distinct from sex, with\ntraditional male and female\nsocietal expectations being\nquestioned and challenged.\nDespite (and probably\npartly because of) her solemn\nand reserved appearance,\nwhich brings to mind Mary\nBarebone in the recent film\nFantastic Beasts and Where\nto Find Them, Tamsin Greig\nis able to put forward a performance which is hilarious\nin the subtlety of its humour.\nThe cold, disapproving stares\nand dramatic, inappropriate\npauses, which are her forte,\nare in stark contrast to her\npuritan exterior: the very stuff\nfrom which ironic comedy is\nmade. Certain moments of the\nplay, however \u2013 such as the\nfrankly outrageous costume\nin which she greets Olivia, or\nthe sudden and exceedingly\ndramatic change of character,\nsuggestive of her repressed\nlove \u2013 are probably unnecessarily over the top, given\nGreig\u2019s talent for being funny\nwithout the need for such an\nobvious display of ridicule.\nPerhaps it was the twirling\ntassels on her costume that\ntipped the scales from hilarity\nto downright disbelief.\nBut Shakespeare\u2019s \u2018comedies\u2019 are not \u2013 in the sense\nof the word \u2013 simply lighthearted and humorous, as a\ncomedy of today might be;\ndespite the hilarious nature\nof this play there is of course\nthe more sombre side that\naccompanies Malvolia\u2019s later\nfate. Grieg\u2019s portrayal of the\ntragedy of a woman whose\nlove has been made into a\njoke was raw in its emotion,\nand heart-breaking to watch.\nAgain, this felt odd in contrast\nwith the incredulity of her\nearlier flashy show.\nIdeas about the roles of\ngender run strong throughout\nthe performance: Feste is also\nplayed by a woman \u2013 Doon\nMackichan \u2013 whose character is playful, light-hearted,\nand very entertaining,\ncertainly lightening the mood;\nTamara Lawrance\u2019s Viola is\nvery boyish and believable,\nquite adorably capturing\nthe humour of the dramatic\nironies of her situation. Her\nantics with Olivia (Phoebe\nFox) whilst cross-dressing as\nCesario, are amusing, and\nthere are fitting touches of\nmodern humour added here\nand there, such as a racy\nscene in a Jacuzzi involving\na set of golden swimming\ntrunks. This would not be possible without a fully-fledged\nwater feature that the stage\nWaleed El-Geresy\nTwelfth Night is on at the\nNational Theatre until 13th\nMay\nTickets from \u00a315\nTwelfth Night \u2013 Tamsin Greig as Malvolia \\\\ Marc Brenner\nis graced with, one which\nalso masquerades as an\nostensible, full-size fountain.\nThe presence of all this water\nseems to simply beg for somebody to get drenched. Suffice\nto say we are not disappointed on those grounds.\nThis audacious scenery is\ntestament to the brilliant show\nput on \u2013 quite literally \u2013 by\nthe technical and lighting\nteam. They make full use of\nthe Olivier Theatre\u2019s majestic\ndrum revolve, whose centre-piece is a grand triangular\nstaircase: at one moment\nstationary, and at the next\nswivelling to create a sense of\nsimultaneity between several\ndifferent settings. Within\nseconds, the set manages to\nchange from a ship crashing\ninto rocks in a storm, to the\nmore docile setting of Olivia\u2019s\nhouse, complete with modern\nlooking glass panels and men\nin suits bright enough to throw\nlight on the future of fashion.\nNot to be outmatched\nby Orsino and his crew, a\nvery hipster Sir Toby Belch,\nplayed by Tim McMullan, is\none of the highlights of this\nperformance. His authentic performance as the\nconstantly drunk uncle was\nso good that it made me feel\nas though the bottles he was\nincessantly swigging from\nwere perhaps slightly more\nthan simple props. Along with\nthe wing-man with a man-bun\nSir Andrew Aguecheek \u2013\nDaniel Rigby \u2013 the two are\nthe comedy relief duo of the\ncomedy itself, entertaining\nus with their various antics to\npleasant tunes sung by Feste\nand a small but skilled team\nof live musicians \u2013 including\na saxophone player and guitarist - adding a lot of aural\ncolour to the atmosphere.\nFor the most part, the\nmodern take on this play\ndoes question ideas about\nsocietal roles well. However,\nattempts to put emphasis on\nthese ideas can sometimes\ngo a bit too far, notably in\na rather flamboyant scene\ninvolving a drag queen\nat a saucy bar called The\nElephant which seemed to be\nin the production for the sole\npurpose of making absolutely\ncertain we understood the\nmain theme. Simply shouting\nTwelfth Night\n| A contrast\nbetween\nsubtlety and\naplomb\nthings louder can sometimes\nproduce an effect opposite\nto that intended \u2013 something not exclusive to the\ndomain of theatre \u2013 and I\nwould say that the cleverest\nmoments of this production\nwere when humour and\nideas were put forward\nless explicitly. On the other\nhand, Twelfth Night is a\ncomedy whose very name\nsuggests it is meant to be\nover the top and outra-geous; Godwin, his cast,\nand the production team\ncertainly managed to put\non a great performance,\nleaving myself and most of\nthe audience in stitches.\n\n"

Blah.Blah.Blah\nfelixonline.co. uk /comment comment.felix@ic.ac.uk\nC O M M E N T\nImperial still\nneeds to divest\nfrom fossil fuels\nAlexandre Adler knows Imperial will\neventually divest, but will it be too late?\nL\nast year, while\ndoing my Erasmus\nat King\u2019s College\nLondon, I spotted a\nsmall placard on the\nwall calling on the\nuniversity to \"divest\" from\nfossil fuels. By this, they meant\nthat the college should not\ninvest in corporations linked\nto fossil fuel extraction and\nexploitation. I am not a large\nfan of endowment funds in\ngeneral and would really\nlike to see a greener world,\nso the idea appealed to\nme immediately. This year,\napparently, a few King\u2019s\nstudents took the campaign\na little further, and spray-painted a few pillars on the\nStrand building, an offence\nfor which they promptly got\narrested (anybody who has\nseen that building\u2019s fa\u00e7ade\nknows that the architect of\nthe Strand building is the\nreal culprit as far as urban\nvandalism is concerned).\nThis year, I study at Imperial.\nI am yet to see a poster calling\nfor the College to divest from\noil and gas. The fossil free campaign has no committee listed\non the Union website, and\nmodels of oil rigs proudly sit\nin the Royal School of Mines.\nSustainability week came and\n\\\\ I guess the only green\nthat matters at Imperial is the\nQueen's Lawn \\\\\nwent, with little clamour. I guess\nthe only green that matters at\nImperial is the Queen\u2019s Lawn.\nThe endowment fund\u2019s repar-tition is unfortunately not\npublicly available informa-tion, and students don\u2019t have\naccess to the contact webpage\nof the people responsible for\nthe fund. As a result, there\nis no way of knowing what\namount Imperial has invested\nin oil, coal and gas, although\nan examination of its performance suggests that much of\nits portfolio is labelled in US\ndollars, as the periods of best\nperformance roughly correlate\nwith slides in the \u00a3. Since we\ndo not know what is in Imperial\u2019s fund, we should assume\nit is standard, and as such has\ninvested to some extent in oil\nand gas companies.\nHowever, the stated objectives of the endowment fund\nwould make a good argument\nfor divestment themselves. The\nstated aims of the fund are a\ngrowth over five years of inflation plus 4%, a lower than\naverage volatility in its invest-ments. Why on God\u2019s green\nEarth would you choose the\nenergy sector as an investment\nthen? These companies\u2019 fortunes are highly dependent\non the economic cycle, as oil\n\\\\ The fossil free\ncampaign has no\ncommittee listed on\nthe Union website,\nand models of oil\nrigs proudly sit in\nRSM \\\\\nbooms and busts closely follow\nthe patterns of global growth.\nNow, if that was the only issue,\nit would not make oil stand out\nall this much; after all, most\ncompanies suffer during a\nrecession. However, fossil fuels\nare also a channel through\nwhich countries leverage political and diplomatic leverage.\nThe destinies of drillers depend\ndecisively on the dreams of\ndemocrats and despots. For\ninstance, every tentative move\nof Ukraine towards the EU\nhas resulted in Russia closing\nthe gas pipelines, forcing gas\nproviders on the continent to\nshed extra money for alternative sources. The explosion of\nIraq inflated oil prices (twice),\nas has the Iranian revolution.\nOn the other side, an attempt\nby Saudi Arabia and Aramco\nto drive out of business the\nUS fracking industry resulted\nin a prolonged slump in oil\nprices that brought numerous\nexploration and equipment\ncompanies to their knees.\nThose are not long-term events\nthat are correlate to the wider\neconomy or to technological\nadvances. Those are shocks\nthat can reduce or inflate the\nvalue of stocks significantly\nwithin hours. As such, it makes\nno sense for college to invest its\nmoney in a sector so volatile,\nsince it states that it looks for\nlow volatility.\nIn the very long term, Imperial will divest from oil, gas and\ncoal, as these energy sources\nwill lose relevance when\nrenewables become cheaper.\nClimate change may cause\nirreparable damages by then,\nbut it will happen eventually. It\nis however crystal clear that as\nlong as the companies of the\nsector have any influence, they\nwill try to slow the transition\ntowards a carbon neutral economy down, in the same way\nthey drove the fight against\nrecognizing global warming\nfor a quarter of a century. In\nits research capacity, Imperial\ndoes not want to associate with\nthose who purposefully slow\ndown progress and spit in the\nface of inconvenient truths.\nWhy should it associate with\nthem financially?\n\\\\ It makes no sense\nfor college to invest\nits money in a sector\nso volatile, since it\nstates that it looks\nfor low volatility \\\\\n\\\\ In its research\ncapacity, Imperial\ndoes not want to\nassociate with those\nwho purposefully\nslow down progress\nand spit in the face\nof inconvenient\ntruths \\\\\nWe really need\nto talk about\neating disorders\nEmily-Jane Cramphorn talks about\nthe importance of eating disorder\nawarenees and how conversation is the\nonly way to tackle the stigma\nT\nhe past week\non campus has\nbeen a busy one,\nwhat with the\n2017 leadership\nelections, \u2018show\nseason\u2019 at the union concert\nhall, and of course Varsity\ngoingon.Butthepastweekhas\nalso seen activists across the\nnation trying to create change\nfor people who are impacted\nby eating disorders. The final\nweek of February is Eating\nDisorders Awareness Week\n(EDAW) both in the UK and the\nUSA, and thus I have worked\nhard to lead a supportive\ncampaign from ICU. Sadly, my\nefforts have been somewhat\novershadowed by what can be\nseen as more pressing issues\nsuch as Elections and Varsity.\nWhilst this is frustrating, I\ncan understand why EDAW\nisn\u2019t at the top of everyone\u2019s\nagenda: eating disorders\nare a seemingly niche and\npoorly understood topic and\nmight not take priority when\nwe are all under pressure to\nmeet deadlines and balance a\nrudimentary social life. This in\nitself is not necessarily a huge\nproblem but it is indicative\nof the wider problem of\nhow eating disorders are\nperceived, discussed and\ntreated in society. We don\u2019t\nhave to talk about eating\ndisorders for only one week\nof the year. I, and others who\nare trying to foster change,\nam willing to talk about eating\ndisorders all year long. The\nproblem is, other people aren\u2019t\nnecessarily as keen because\neating disorders aren\u2019t\nseen as hugely important.\nEating disorders are a huge,\ncomplex and somewhat\nterrifying subject and as such\npeople tend to shy away from\nthe conversation. Talking\nabout eating disorders is one\nof those things that you keep\nputting to the side because\nyou want to do it right but\nyou\u2019re not quite sure how to\ngo about it. Then of course\n\\\\ You never know when\nyour life might be derailed\nby an eating disorder \\\\\nthere are the people who\nsimply think eating disorders\naren\u2019t a real problem and\nthat those suffering are just\nnarcissistic teenage girls who\nwant to look like Kate or\nCara. The reality is that by\nnot engaging in conversation\nabout eating disorders \u2013 and\nI don\u2019t mean spreading gossip\nabout celebrity weight \u2013 we\nare doing more harm than by\nsaying the wrong thing. By\ntalking about eating disorders\nwith those whose lives have\nbeen touched by them we\nlearn about the dos and don\u2019ts\nfor conversations in the future.\nBut more importantly we\ncontinue to chip away at the\nstigma and misconceptions,\nstarting with openly discussing\neating disorders. Quite\nfrankly, eating disorders are\neverybody\u2019sproblembecause,\nas a previous B-eat slogan\nemphasises, \u201ceverybody\nknows somebody\u201d. Eating\ndisorders affect at least 10%\nof our population without\ntaking into account those\nwho are undiagnosed and\nthe loved ones of sufferers.\nPeople should take an interest\nin eating disorders, not just\nbecause of people like me\nshouting about it, but because\nyou never know when your life\nmight be derailed by one.\nEating disorders count some\nof the deadliest mental illnesses\namongst their ranks. Despite\n20% of anorexics dying as a\nresult of their condition, the\nmedia still celebrate thinness,\nself-deprivation and obsessive\nrelationships with food. The\nsame culture, and a wave of\nskinny-shaming culture born\nout of it, trivialises eating disorders as something sufferers\nchoose and can simply give\nup at will. Megan Trainor,\nfor example, who\u2019s been heralded as a body positive role\nmodel, told reporters that she\n\u201ctried being anorexic for an\nhour\u201d and then got her mum\nto make her a sandwich, showing her gross misunderstanding\nof what anorexia is. Yet this\nmessage has been perpetuated and celebrated by those\ntrying to fight back against\n\\\\ Sadly, my efforts\nhave been somewhat overshadowed\nby what can be seen\nas more pressing\nissues \\\\\ndiet culture. Anorexia is not\na choice; one does not simply\ntry being anorexic and eat a\nsandwich when it\u2019s too difficult.\nAnorexia is a deadly and life\nwrecking mental illness that\nhas claimed too many wonderful people from this earth.\nAnother myth perpetuated by\nthe media is that people with\neating disorders are skinny.\nWhilst that is the case for\nsome, the majority of people\nwith an eating disorder are\nnot underweight. Anorexia is\none of the least common eating\ndisorders yet is what we generally think of when discussing\neating disorders. Thousands\nof people suffer in isolation\nthrough fear of being ridiculed\nor disbelieved if they talk about\ntheir eating disorders, simply\nbecause they are not under-weight. And for those who\nare underweight, there is a\nfear of not being underweight\nenough, perpetuated by comments like \u201cbut you don\u2019t look\nanorexic\u201d and the rationing\nof treatments based on body\nmass index. The only way\nto change this rhetoric is to\nchallenge it through conversation and education, hence the\nimportance of eating disorders\nawareness week.\nThis year\u2019s EDAW theme\nfocuses on early intervention,\nwhich is shown to improve\nprognosis for those with\neating disorders, and aims to\nincite change in the treatment\nof eating disorders by removing BMI barriers and allowing\nsufferers to access treatments\nregardless of weight. Removing low-BMI requirements\nfrom treatment is extremely\n\\\\ The majority of\npeople with an eating disorder are not\nunderweight \\\\\n\\\\ Eating disorders\ncount some of the\ndeadliest mental\nillnesses amongst\ntheir ranks \\\\\n\\\\ Removing low-BMI requirements\nfrom treatment is\nextremely important\nin helping people\nrecover faster and\nfuller \\\\\nimportant in helping people\nrecover faster and fuller, but\nit has the power to change\nso much more than that by\nremoving the stigma around\nhaving an eating disorder\nwithout being underweight.\nPlease help fight stigma by\nlearning a little more or starting\na conversation about eating\ndisorders over the coming\nweeks. Oh! and if you haven\u2019t\nalready done so, please check\nout the EDAW online prize\ndraw on the union shop, every\npenny will go to B-eat and will\nhelp save a life.\n\n"

This competition,\ncontrary to the competition\nhappening in November,\nis not called \u201catemis\u201d but\n\u201crandoris\u201d. Randori is a type\nof practice that you can also\nencounter in judo, it is a way\nof applying and practicing\nyour knowledge freely,\nplaying around with the\ntechniques you\u2019ve gathered\nso far.\nThe weekend was divided\nas follows: training Saturday\nmorning and, for those who\ncan practice with a hangover,\nSunday morning; qualification\nfights on Saturday afternoon\nand finals Sunday afternoon.\nAnd it wouldn\u2019t be a proper\ncompetition weekend without\na party on Saturday!!! The\ndress code of the party was\nsmart casual, meaning you\nwould see all participants you\nhad just fought out of their\nsweaty \u201cgi\u201d (the traditional\noutfit that looks like white\npyjamas) and all groomed\nup, but with still a few leftover\nbruises and scratches \u2026\nThe morning training\nstarts with a warm up, and\nparticipants are then divided\nby grade. Each grade will\nget to train with up to three\ninstructors, practicing techniques needed for their next\ngrade or perfecting one they\nalready knew. After this all\ngrades are mixed and train\ntogether, also with different\ninstructors who can pick out\na particular technique they\nwould like to teach. After a\nsmall lunch break the competition starts.\nIn this type of competition,\nparticipants are divided\nbetween male and female,\nby grade, and by weight\nclass. The higher your grade,\nthe more techniques (locks,\nchokes, strangles\u2026fun times)\nyou are allowed to use. For\nthe referees to not get confused between participants\nin a fight, opponents have\nto wear belts of different\ncolours, for us it was red\nand white. Penalties can be\nattributed if a participant\ndoes not respect the rules of\nthe competition, or if they try\nto apply a technique that is\nnot allowed for their grade. A\nparticipant can be declared\nforfeit if they pass out on\nthe mat (meaning that they\nusually did not tap out from a\nhold when they should have),\nor cannot stop a bleeding\n(doesn\u2019t matter how small) in\na reasonable time.\nAll grades have to go\nthrough a \u201cne waza\u201d competi-tion, which is all groundwork:\ncompetitors start sitting down,\nback to back, and after the\nstart is given they can win\nthe round by pinning their\nopponent to the ground for\n20 seconds, put them in a\nlock and make them tap out,\nor if they don\u2019t manage to\nget a clear win the referees\nwill decide who won the fight\ndepending on technique and\ninitiative demonstrated.\nGrades green and above\nalso have to go through a\nstanding, or \u201ctachi waza\u201d,\ncompetition consisting of\ntrying to throw your opponent\nas they are resisting you.\nCompetitors start standing,\nface to face, and try to throw\neach other to the ground.\nPoints are given for each\nthrow relative to the control\ngetting off of it after the fight,\nbow to the referee and then\nto each other. This essentially\nmean that the competitors\nrespect and entrust themselves to each other, and if\nanybody gets hurt there will\nbe no bad feelings about it.\nDuring the fights the edges\nof the mat area are crowded\nwith people cheering for the\ncompetitors, and trying to\nshout out relevant advice.\nEven though it can put some\npressure on you, having your\nclub and other jitsu friends\ncheering for you does give\nyou more confidence and\npushes you to go all out\neven more to win the fight.\nThe fights do not last more\nthan a few minutes, but they\nare extremely tiring. Being\nagainst somebody of the\nsame build as you usually\nmeans that they will have the\nsame type of fighting prefer-ences, making it really tough\nto do anything as you are\nboth trying to do the same\nthing.\nRESULTS:\nYellows men: silver and 4th\nin\nground\nOrange women: bronze in\nground\nGreen women: gold in\nground and standing\nPurple Women: 4th\nin\nground, silver in standing\nPurple men: silver in ground\nand standing\ndemonstrated while executing\nthe technique. There is a point\nlimit as well as a time limit for\nthose fights.\nEven though we are all\ntrying to beat the lights out of\neach other, respect between\ncompetitors is omnipres-ent, and opponents usually\nbecome really good friends.\nYou can see most fights\nending up with a smile and an\nexhausted hug or a respectful\nhandshake. Respect is a big\npart of Jiu Jitsu: competitors\nbow (\u201crei\u201d) before getting\non the mat to fight and when\n\\\\ The higher the\ngrade, the more\ntechniques (locks,\nchocks, strangles ...\nfun times) you are\nallowed to use \\\\\n\n"

As I\u2019m sure you\nare aware, Labour lost the\nCopeland seat and held on\nto the Stoke seat, but suffered\na reduction in the proportion\nof votes compared to 2015.\nThis is viewed by many, myself\nincluded, as a crucial test\nof Labour\u2019s appeal to the\ngeneral public, particularly\nat a transformative time in\nLabour\u2019s history.\nLabour is of course under the\nleadership of Jeremy Corbyn,\nfor some he is a saviour and\nhero of the left, and for others,\nhe is its damnation. Many\nhave linked his leadership\nto Labour\u2019s struggle in the\npolls, blaming his inconsistent\nposition on the EU, his weak\nstance on defence and NATO\nand his association with the\nleft wing group Momentum,\nas well as the anti-Semitism\nscandal in the Labour Party.\nOthers, most recently John\nMcdonnell, have blamed the\nlack of unity in the Labour\nparty, such as Tony Blair\u2019s\ncriticism of his leadership, as\n\\\\ Before the Labour\nParty elected Jeremy, it was already in\ncrisis \\\\\nwell as other criticism from\nwithin the Labour Party. It is\nimportant to note that since\nJeremy\u2019s election, there have\nbeen 11 by-elections, of which\nonly 1 has been a loss for\nLabour.\nWhen examining the current\nsituation Labour is in, it is\nimportant to contextualise\nthese results: they are by-elections and are not an\nindicator of how the nation\nwill vote in three years\u2019 time.\nWith any luck, May will make\ndomestic and foreign policy\nerrors, and there is usually a\ntrend towards unpopularity\nfor the ruling party as its reign\ncomes to an end.\nHowever, it is possible to\nsay that Labour is not in a\ngood place. This is the first\ntime since 1982 that an\nopposition party has lost a\nseat to the governing party in\na by-election. In a recent poll\n(Opinium/Observer), Labour\nwas predicted to win 30%\nof the votes compared to the\nConservatives' 38%, likely\nleading to a large election\nloss. Whether Jeremy is\nentirely to blame for these low\npolling figures is the matter of\ncontention.\nI would argue that before the\nLabour Party elected Jeremy,\nit was already in crisis. It had\nlost the 2015 election \u2013 to a\ncoalition and a Tory party\nthat pushed through hard line\nausterity as its policy \u2013 and\nit had lost critical political\ncapital to the SNP and UKIP.\nJeremy wouldn\u2019t have even\nbeen in contention if this were\nnot the case. Labour under\nthe leadership of Tony Blair\nand Gordon Brown taking\nthe UK into the Iraq War,\ninto Afghanistan, and most\ncrucially through the 2008\nGreat Recession has greatly\nimpacted Labour\u2019s image.\nThe impression that Labour is\nnot good for the economy has\nstuck, and the perception that\nthe Conservatives played a\nmajor role in cleaning up the\nmess is prevalent. Labour is\nstill viewed by many as a pro-globalisation, pro-free market\nparty, and in the aftermath of\nBrexit, this is a less electable\nposition.\nJeremy Corbyn has not been\nable to shift this image that\nLabour is bad for the economy.\nHe has simply added some\nextra problems that make\n\\\\ Jeremy is a man\nof principle, but\nit takes a man of\ncompromise to\nbe an effective\npolitician \\\\\nLabourevenmoreunelectable,\nchief among them that he\nis not a strong or effective\nleader. He has been unable to\nreconcile those members of his\nparty that were not part of the\nmembership explosion that\nresulted in his election and\nhas also supported policies\nand positions that do not\nappeal to traditional Labour\nvoters. Essentially, Jeremy is\ncurrently attempting to run the\nparty in order to please the\nmembership that elected him,\nas opposed to acknowledging\nthat the wider electorate\nhas much broader desires\nthan those of the Corbynistas\nthat form the base of his\nsupport. Jeremy is a man of\nprinciple, but it takes a man of\ncompromise to be an effective\npolitician and account for all\npoints of view.\nIn my view, Labour\nwinning the next election\nwas always a long shot, for\nall the reasons previously\nmentioned. Unfortunately,\nthe voters to whom Jeremy\nwants to appeal \u2013 the young\nand disenfranchised \u2013 do not\nvote in force historically and\nhe is only further alienating\nthose that would vote for him\nwith his policies on Brexit,\nTrident, and the fact that he\nlacks the abilities of a leader\nthat could truly unite the left\nand oust the Tories. A more\nreasonable expectation would\nbe too ensure that an effective\nopposition is maintained,\nbut he is simply failing in\nthat regard, and a lack of\nopposition can be devastating\nto the democratic process.\nOf course the title of this\narticle is inflammatory. I\u2019m\nnot really suggesting that\nhe should register for the\nDignitas\u2122 treatment, but\nlooking at it this way, Labour\nwas already on life support,\nand Jeremy is helping to\nassure that the Labour Party\nis on the train to Bern. He\nreally is committed to leading\nthe party through thick and\nthin, he will be there to hold\nits hand as it drifts off into the\nblack abyss of irrelevance.\n\\\\ Jeremy has not been able\nto shift this image that Labour is bad for the economy.\nHe has simply added some\nextra problems \\\\\n\\\\ Labour was\nalready on life\nsupport, and Jeremy\nis helping to assure\nthe Labour Party is\nit's on the train to\nBern \\\\\nTrump's cabinet\nis cleverer than\nyou think\nAlexander Luisi compares the language\nused by Trump's administration and the\nParty in Orwell's 1984\nT\nhe language\nof the Trump\na d m i n i s t r a t i o n\nfascinates me. The\ndaily barrage of\ncomments, tweets\nand press conferencesreveals\nsomething quite fundamental\nabout the way that the\ngovernment is operating, and\nhow it will operate. It\u2019s hard to\nbelieve that the administration\nis not in utter chaos, and what\nis striking is the language used\nin the information presented,\nand the nature in which it\nis presented. It conveys a\nsemblance of order and the\nimpression that the President\nand his team are 'doing great\u2019.\nSoundfamiliar?That\u2019sbecause\nit is. The limited vocabulary of\nTrump is starkly Orwellian in\nnature. Groan you may \u2013 it\u2019s\npretty clich\u00e9 to compare any\naspect of any government to\nthat in 1984 \u2013 but aside from\nillustrating totalitarianism, the\nnovel dealt with the nuanced\naspects of a regime that was\ndetermined to demonstrate its\ncoherence to the people, so\nmakes for a solid comparison.\nThe simplicity of Trump\u2019s\nlanguage is staggering. His\nvocabulary is incredibly basic\nand his sentences are very short\n\u2013 it is far from that expected of\na statesman. George W. Bush\nmanaged words with more syl-lables. On the campaign trail\n\\\\ Because the language is\nunequivocal, it may be hard\nto believe anything other\nthan the given information if\ntaken at face value \\\\\nthis lack of linguistic ability\nexposed the man as a semi-co-herent orator with barely the\ncapacity for holding office.\nCountless times were the words\n\"great\", \"terrible\", \"strong\",\n\"weak\", \"winning\" and \"losing\"\nused, and always in their direct\npairs. Now in power, this\nsimplicity has become more\nsinister and is reminiscent of\nNewspeak, the language used\nin Orwell\u2019s dystopia. Its purpose is to \"diminish the range of\nthought\", to suit the ideological\nneeds of the Party by removing\nall but the essential meaning of\nwords so as to prevent thought-crime. In the case of the Trump\nadministration, this particular\nset of words and others have\nbeen used to the point where\nthey have lost all but their\nbare meaning. Though completely unintentional, it would\nmake a lot of sense if it were\napplied to suit an ideological\ngoal \u2013 simple language has\nthe benefit of concisely conveying a point without ambiguity.\nFor example, Trump\u2019s government is constantly reaffirming\nits position and how well it is\ndoing, so when Donald Trump\nor his press secretary Sean\nSpicer use \u2018great\u2019, they create\na fa\u00e7ade of control, where the\nsituation is better than just average (which is the implication of\ntheir use of \u2018good\u2019). With this\nrestricted range of words, and\ntherefore thought, it would\nseem to the uncritical ear that\nthe government is functioning.\nThe fact that the travel ban was\nimplemented for several days\nwith government officials and\nsupporters alike defending it\nreinforces that the actions of\nthe government are at face\nvalue, as clear-cut as their\nlanguage.\nNow combine this basic,\nunequivocal language with\nhow the administration delivers information and you get a\nrecipe for something that is in\nthe same vein as the Ministry\nof Truth. The persistent television interviews with Kellyanne\nConway or Stephen Miller, as\nwell as the painful press conferences with Sean Spicer, seem\nto give different narratives as\nthey go and then finally agree\non a common line of thought,\nsomewhat akin to the work of\nOrwell\u2019s protagonist Winston\nin Minitrue when he has to sift\nthrough old news articles and\nreports altering information to\nsuit the Party. When Oceania\nchanges adversaries in the\nwar from Eurasia to Eastasia,\nthe history of the perpetual\nconflict is entirely rewritten,\nresulting in public outrage that\nEastasia was the enemy all\nalong, with blind disregard for\nthe past. This is because of the\nbare meaning of the language\nand its constructs, and how it\nhas subsequently discouraged\nthoughtcrime. A similar phenomenon is happening with\nTrump, his cabinet and his\nsupporters as a whole \u2013 personified best by \u201calternative\nfacts\u201d. Take the recent resignation of the National Security\nadvisor Michael Flynn. The initial report to the media, from\nConway, was that Flynn had,\n\u201cthe full confidence\u201d of the\n\\\\ With this\nrestricted range\nof words, and\ntherefore thought, it\nwould seem to the\nuncritical ear that\nthe government is\nfunctioning \\\\\nPresident but only a few hours\nlater, our favourite press secretary declared that the situation\nhad become, \u201cunsustainable\u201d\nbecause the Vice President\nhad been misled by Flynn\nregarding his conversations\nwith the Russian Ambassador.\nHistory wasn\u2019t rewritten (thank-fully there is still a free press,\nalmost) but this deliberate oversight of what was previously\nannounced, combined with the\nquick affirmation by others in\nthe administration eerily resembles events during Hate Week\nin 1984. Because the language\nis unequivocal, it may be hard\nto believe anything other than\nthe given information if taken\nat face value.\nCould the language of the\nAdministration actually devolve\nentirely into a bare-meaning\ndialect like Newspeak? Its\nimmediate meaning certainly\nportrays the current situation\nwith no attention to what happened previously, which makes\nit so powerful from an ideological standpoint. If Trump and\nhis government were to cap-italise on this while gagging\nand intimidating the media the\nimplications on the mind-set of\nsociety, or at the very least his\nsupporters, would be \u2018yuge\u2019.\nNo. Instead, the reality is that\nTrump has already, and will\ncontinue to become a victim of\nhis own language. This could\nmean four years might not be\nfour years after all. If it is a full\nterm, there\u2019s always the memes\nto look forward to.\n\\\\ This deliberate\noversight of what\nwas previously\nannounced,\ncombined with quick\naffirmation by others\nin the administration,\neerily resembles\nevents during Hate\nWeek in 1984 \\\\\n\n"

In my five years at Imperial\nI have gained experience as a club\nmember, as a club treasurer and in a\norganisation and development role as\nManagement Group Chair for ICSM.\nMy experience has given me valuable\ninsight into areas where we do really\nwell and three main areas which I\nwould like to develop (and form a\nconvenient acronym):\nTraining- You say you have felt under-prepared for your volunteer roles, so I\nwill ensure that appropriate training is\ntailored for all students, allowing you to\nfeel confident in your roles.\nOpenness-You sometimes feel that the\nUnion, College and Sport Imperial are\nThomas BacareseHamilton\ntoo opaque. I will ensure that all relevant\ninformation is released in a way which\nyou are able to understand.\nManagement- You have long\ncomplained about minibuses, storage\nand room bookings. I will review how\nwe manage club amenities to ensure\nthat you are able to get the maximum\navailable.\nFor my full manifesto, and to ask\nquestions, visit https://votetom.wixsite.\ncom/gettom and don\u2019t forget to find and\nshare my facebook event! Don\u2019t forget\nto VOTE TOM, GET T.O.M.\n\u201cIf loving Imperial College\u2019s clubs and\nsocieties was a crime, by all means lock\nme up\u201d\n\u2013 James Snakey every Wednesday.\nAlright fellas and fellarinas, my name is\nJames and I am an anticipating Biology\ngraduate, a 3-year veteran/committee\nmember of ICHC and just a stand-up guy looking to contribute. A more\nextra-curricular approach to university\nlife cannot be stressed enough, even\nat an academia focused institution like\nImperial as it will grant a more rounded\nand meaningful student experience.\nI have a dream of an Imperial where\nstudents strive to strike a perfect\nbalance between academia and often\nforgotten extra-curriculars. I shall\nachieve my vision by being voted as\nthe people\u2019s representative in order\nto synergistically forge the bridges\nbetween the clubs and societies and\nthe Imperial College Union. I might not\nbe the most experienced but I more\nthan make up for that in passion and\ncreativity. Furthermore, if you believe\nin honesty and transparency, I strictly\nsuggest you give consider me for vote\nas I\u2019m a straight shooter and what you\nJames Breakey see is what you get.\nPolicies include: Working alongside\nDPFS on delivering clearer policies on\nhow funding pots (tour funding, ADF,\nBUCS) are allocated. Granting the Union\nresponsibility to handle their own\ngeneral club issues independently whilst\nSport Imperial only handle bookings/\nfixtures. Allowing management groups\nchairs to sit on more sport boards for\nbetter student representation. Campus\ndrinks prices match local competition\n(e.g. The Slug). Finding better storage\nfacilities. Imperial sports teams must\nhave a snake-based mascot.\nYusuf Qureshi\nThis candidate did not supply a manifesto.\nCandidate Manifestos: Deputy President (Education)\nWhy Pick Nick to be your next Deputy\nPresident (Education)? Pick Nick for\nexperience: As Academic Affairs Officer\nfor ICSM this year, I have represented\nthe educational needs of hundreds of\nbiomedical and medical students across\n13 different subjects.

My Imperial\nexperience however extends beyond\nCGCU. Through my interactions with\nstudents from different departments, I\nhave developed a deep understanding\nof the issues faced by the wider student\nbody.\nDespite having headed societal\ncampaigns with teams of over a\nhundred fellow students, I still come up\nagainst the academic shortcomings of\nImperial daily. For this reason, I am close\nenough to the issues at hand that I can\npresent your concerns accurately and\nfrom your perspective. With this intuitive\nunderstanding, and by unlimited\naccessibility to you, I am confident we\ncan tackle the following issues:\nFeedback: The unacceptable\ninconsistency with feedback times\nfor projects and courseworks needs\nto be addressed. I will work tirelessly\nto introduce stringent operating\nprocedures, lowering these waiting\ntimes across all departments.\nPanopto: Potato level recordings,\ndelayed uploads or complete non-Mohamed Elyas existence. Any or all of these may\naccurately describe your experience of\nPanopto. I will endeavour to work with\nstaff directly to increase the quality,\nreliability and availability of E-learning\nmaterial. Interdepartmental fluidity: I will\nwork towards increasing the amount\nof academic interaction that is possible\nbetween disciplines. By opening up\nlearning resources for courses in one\nfield to the other faculties, I plan to\nprovide students with the ability to take\na module from a different subject with\nease, allowing them to diversify their\nknowledge.\nCandidate Manifestos: Deputy President (Finance & Services)\nHi, I am Matt and I am running to be\nyour DPFS. I am a final year Chemistry\nand Business School student and as\nyour DPFS I would:\nINCREASE EXTERNAL INCOME TO\nMAKE YOUR UNION BETTER VALUE\no Centralised Sponsorship of the Union\no Life Membership funding directly to\nCSPs o Union minibuses during holidays\nBETTER SERVICE EXPERIENCE IN THE\nBARS AND SHOPS\no Increase range and quality of food\no No above-inflation drink price rises\no Improve non-SK campus facilities\nMAKE FUNDING AND SERVICES\nPROPERLY SUPPORT CSPs\no All minibuses to be roadworthy at\nthe start of the year o Coach service to\nHeston and Harlington o Centralised\nclub regalia\nMAKE YOUR UNION MORE ACCESSIBLE\no Student involvement in the biggest\nUnion-run events o Increased number\nand quality of part-time Union jobs o\nContinue financial infographic series\no Promote Imperial Plus\nMatthew Blackett And finally, pre-poured pints at ACC Bar\nnights!\nIn my 4 years at Imperial, I have been\nheavily involved with various clubs &\nsocieties holding positions of financial\nresponsibility, including as the ACC\nManagement Group Vice-Chair. Having\nstudied good financial practice in the\nBusiness School, I will make sure the\nUnion\u2019s finances are in safe hands. It is\nthese experiences of interacting with\nevery level of the Union, as well as my\nstraight-forward, pragmatic, problem-fixer attitude that will allow me to\nimprove your experience of the Union.\nYusuf Qureshi\nThis candidate did not supply a manifesto.\n\n"

The\nBottle was lost! In the midst of\none of the biggest storms the\nsouth coast had ever seen,\nthe RSM rugby players fell\nvictim to the CSM scum in\nthe muddy trenches. A year\nlater in the leafy suburbs\nof Harlington a new mining\noutfit strode out to make\nbattle, adorned in their new\nwindstopper jackets #stash. It\nwas time for the annual Bottle\nMatch, the world\u2019s 2nd\noldest\nrugby varsity, to commence.\nWith both sidelines cheering\nand jeering the players on\nwith effervescent merriment,\nthe whistle sounded and Sam\nMoorby got us underway.\nAfter some strong defence\nfrom RSM in the opposition\nhalf, we were rewarded with\nthe first penalty of the match\nand a chance for Moorby\nto put the Black and Gold\nin front, which he duly took.\nCSM pitched the ball high off\nthe kick-off, RSM collected\nand kicked back deep to\nkeep the pressure on the\nCornishmen. More good\ndefence resulted in a quick\nturnover and after some good\nphase-play from hard running\nforwards, James Field spread\nthe ball wide to Dunning\nwho skilfully drew his man\nand offloaded to Moorby to\ncanter over unopposed on\nthe left wing. Moorbs once\nagain held his nerve with\nthe boot to put us up by ten\npoints. From the restart, which\nDNS collected in his usual\nover-the-head fashion, RSM\nkept up the same flowing and\naccurate style of play, rounding off several good phases\nwith another penalty kick. Ten\nminutes gone and with a 13\npoint lead, the bottle seemed\nlike it was on its way back to\nthe capital. CSM, however,\nhad other plans and came\nstorming back straight from\nthe kick off, piling the pressure on to the RSM forwards\nwith good line speed and low\ntackles. From a turnover they\nworked it wide and with a\nslipped tackle, dived over the\nline to get themselves slightly\nback into the game. 13-8 to\nRSM. However, having their\nlead cut only seemed to spur\nthe Londoners on. From the\nnext scrum on the halfway\nline, and with a sizable\nblindside to attack, no. eight\nZaboronsky took off in his\nusual sideways fashion and,\nignoring calls for a pass from\nthe wing, broke through three\ntackles before finally offload-ing to set Amato up with some\nclear air ahead of him and\nonly one covering defender\nto beat. Using his quick feet\nand outrageous pace, he\nrounded the last man to dot\ndown and restore RSM\u2019s\nearly dominance, to many\ncheers from the Black and\nGold sideline. Moorby was\nonce again impeccable from\nthe tee, neatly bisecting the\nposts from near the touchline.\nThis try seemed to get under\nthe skin of those in blue and\nyellow shirts, with a few scuffles erupting in the following\nminutes, which the ref calmed\ndown with a severe scalding.\nThere followed a mundane\npassage of play with both\nsides committing many errors\nand not being able to sustain\nenough pressure to trouble\neither defence. But, as if he\nhad sensed the game needed\nsparking up, out of nowhere,\na thumping dump tackle by\nMike Wright landed a poor\nCSM player flat on his back\nand doubled over in pain. The\nref, however, feared for the\npoor CSM player\u2019s dignity in\nfront of all of his mates, and\nshowed Wright a yellow card\nfor his excellent technique.\nBut even being down to 14\nmen did not phase the RSM,\nas they fought back hard to\nget into the opposition 22.\nBlackett won a penalty after\ncollecting a loose ball only to\nbe tackled high, with the CSM\nattempted tackler having\nto be taken off for a blood\nreplacement. Moorby easily\ntapped over the penalty from\nin front. Shortly after, CSM\nwere dealt another blow with\ntheir captain having to be\nstretchered off with a broken\nleg, thus ending the first half\nfive minutes early.\nBoth teams came flying out\nof the blocks for the second\nperiod with more big hits and\noutrageous steps. Everything\nwas going RSM\u2019s way\nthough, as they got straight\nback into the opposition half\nand after some sustained\npressure, once again we spun\nthe ball wide and this time\nMoorby turned provider to\nput Captain Dunne (Ruairi\nRuairi Dunne, Ruairi Dunne,\nRuaaaairi Ruairi Dunne, nah\nnah nah nah nah) through for\nRSM\u2019s third try of the match.\nCSM came back with another\ntry through some offloads and\na bit of luck from the bounce\nof the ball but Moorby gave\nus some more breathing room\nwith two more penalties.\nWith two minutes to go, the\nCornishmen converted from a\nwide move off a lineout within\nour 22. However, shortly\nafter the kick off they knocked\non and Blackett sent the ball\ninto the crowds to the sound\nof the whistle, kicking off the\nwild celebrations and pitch\ninvasion. Dunne was hoisted\nonto shoulders to receive the\nbottle which he held aloft\nto triumphant cheers from\nthe Black and Gold army.\nThe crowd and players then\nreturned to the union to place\nthe bottle in its rightful place\nand celebrate their success.\nFinal score RSM 36-19 CSM.\nThe Bottle is home.\n\\\\ Ten minutes gone\nand with a 13 point\nlead, the bottle\nseemed like it was\non its way back to\nthe capital. CSM,\nhowever, had other\nplans \\\\\n\\\\ The ref, however,\nfeared for the\npoor CSM player\u2019s\ndignity ... and\nshowed Wright a\nyellow card for his\nexcellent\ntechnique \\\\\n\n"

Over the past four\nyears I\u2019ve been at Imperial, I\u2019ve written\nmany high-quality articles for Felix,\nranging from science to technology\nand gaming. Being deeply involved with\nthe newspaper as a content provider,\nI have a very different outlook on how\nFelix should operate than those who\u2019ve\nworked as section editors.\nThe lack of diversity is still an issue, and\nthere needs to be a drive to encourage\na wider array of students to contribute.\na wider array of students to contribute.\nHowever, the biggest issue facing the\nnewspaper is its lack of digital presence;\nthe infrequency of Facebook posts and\nthe lack of any web-only content is\nholding the paper back significantly, and\nthis sorely needs to be rectified.\nThis is exactly what I aim to improve,\nby holding more open, well-publicised\nevents to tackle general tips for writing\narticles, aimed towards giving people\nmore confidence to contribute. I will\nmassively increasing Felix\u2019s social media\npresence, by posting articles as soon\nas they are done, posting small, web-as they are done, posting small, web-only articles and videos on the more\ninteresting content, such as interviews\nwith the authors or more in-depth\ndiscussions on a topic. Having been\nPublicity Head of Charity Week, I have\nample experience with publicising\nevents, which I can use to promote\nFelix. I also aim to give societies allotted\ntimes to contribute articles to promote\nupcoming events and discuss relevant\ncontent. This, along with inter-uni\narticles and contributors will significantly\nboost readership and make Felix a paper\nto be proud of.\n\n"

It is\ntypical for Union policies to\nbe reviewed en mass at the\nend of the year, felix was told\nby a Union official. A look\nat the last Council meeting\nfor the year 2015/16 for\nexample, shows that eight\npolicies were discussed. These\ninclude the Unpaid Internships\nPolicy, which condemns the\nexploitation of students by\ncompanies which have the\nmeans to pay for labour,\nthe Tankards Policy, which\noutlines the management\nof one of Europe\u2019s largest\ntankard collections (hosted\nin the Union Bar) including\nnew tankard specs, and the\nEnvironmental Policy which\npresents guidelines on waste\nreduction, water use, carbon\nemissions, energy and\ntransport.\nAgain it is unclear whether\nthese policies were passed or\namended in any way as the\nminutes currently available\naren\u2019t particularly detailed or\nhelpful.\nAt the same time there\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be a trace\nof the review progress of\nother policies. Including the\nTransport Policy and the\nDrinks Service Policy. Have\nthese policies expired and if\nso what does that mean?\nWe asked Stephen Naulls, a\nHow many Union policies are still active?\nLess than half according to the website but is that true?\nLef Apostolakis\nT\nhe Union has fallen\nbehind maintaining\nup to date policies\nresponsible for\nmanaging a range\nof issues, from\nEquality of Opportunities\nto Club Society and Project\n(CSP) Equipment.\nA felix investigation found\nthat according to the Union\nwebsite, out of the Union\u2019s\n70 policies, 36 are currently\nmarked as expired. Though\nsome of the expired policies\nhave become redundant, such\nas CSP Budgeting Policy 15-16\nwhich has been replaced with\nBudgeting Policy 2016/17,\nothers remain essential\nfor managing the Union\u2019s\noperations, such as the Tours\nPolicy, which describes how\ntours are defined and should\nbe taken into consideration\nwhen budgets are allocated\ntowards tours.\nOthers protect the Union\nfrom legal risk, such as the also\nlapsed Freedom of Speech\nand Events Approval Policy\nwhich is meant to be adhered\nto by all students organising\nevents on and off campus.\nThe policy ensures that\nchecks are made on external\nspeakers and that events\ncomply to the Union\u2019s Equality\nof Opportunities Policy\n(which has also expired), so\nas to minimise risks such as\nconducting unlawful political\nactivity, breaching public\nbenefit principles or even\nputting the safety of attendees\nat risk.\nOne Union source said \u201cIt\ndefines our interactions with\nexternal speakers. We have\nto have one as part of Prevent\nand puts us at terrible risk.\u201d\nAlthough we were informed\nby Union President, Nas\nAndriopoulos, that this\nparticular policy should\nactually still be in accordance\nwith the bye-laws and\nconstitution which say policy\nexists for three years since\nratification, and as it was\npassed in June 2015, it should\nbe live until June 2018. \u201cI do\nbelieve the webpage showing\nthe lapsed date of July 2016 is\nerroneous.\u201d At the same time it\nis stated in the policy that the\npolicy needs to be reviewed\nannually (to ensure that it\u2019s\nuptodate with Prevent updates\npresumably). Confused? So\nare we.\nFurthermore, some policies\nseem to have been renewed\nby the Board of Trustees but\nhave not been updated on the\nUnion\u2019s website, such as the\nAssociate Membership Policy,\nveteran Council member, now\nalumnus and honorary life\nmember of the Union who said\nthat \u201cIt is perfectly reasonable\nto assert that \u201clapse\u201d (as\nused in Bye Law C) means\nthat the policy no longer has\nany standing and thus there\nis no need to even entertain\nany reference to the lapsed\npolicy. Thus there is space for\nindividuals to make executive\ndecisions.\u201d\nBut the real issue is the lack\nof transparency and even\nknowledge as to the Union\u2019s\nresolutions. With the annual\nbrain drain which follows\nthe succession of sabbatical\nofficers, it is easy to lose track\nof what needs doing within the\norganisation.\nSure, maybe the Transport\nPolicy has expired and you can\nnow use the Union minibuses\nfor your IKEA trip, or maybe\nthe Drinks Service Policy has\nlapsed and you\u2019re now able to\norder triple shots, quadruple\nshots and really any multiple\nyou desire and have anything\n\\\\ Out of the Union\u2019s\n70 policies, 36 are\ncurrently marked as\nexpired \\\\\nTechnically you can have as\nmany as you want \\\\ Jim Sher\n\\\\ Though some of\nthe expired policies\nhave become\nredudant...others\nremain essential for\nmanaging\nthe Union\u2019s\noperations \\\\\n\\\\ It is unclear\nwhether these\npolicies were\npassed or amended\nin any way as the\nminutes currently\navailable aren\u2019t\nparticularly detailed\nor helpful \\\\\nApparently it\u2019s one of the largest collections in Europe \\\\ ICU\nyou want mixed into anything\nelse you want, including spirits\ninto draughts (though there\nare undeniably many more\nserious side effects to the lack\nof an updated Drinks Service\npolicy, and god knows the\nlegal risk the Union is putting\nitself in).\nBut the fact that no one really\nknows is the real issue.\n\u201cThis is a recurring problem\u201d\nsays Stephen Ball, an alumnus\nand honorary life member of\nthe Union. \u201cThe issue is that\nwhen there is no official policy\nthere is nothing to direct staff,\nsabbs or students in their\ndecisions. This can allow\nindividuals to make unilateral\ndecisions without consultation\nor making inconsistent\ndecisions without a good\nbasis e.g. the order minibuses\nare rented out \u2013 which club\ngets priority. This opens the\ndoor to the possibility of\nchallenges, of discrimination\nor bias. But it also puts sabbs,\nstaff and student volunteers in\nchallenging situations as they\nhave to make judgement calls.\n\u201c[This] is a longstanding issue\nand is reflective of the seeming\nlack of concern being given\nto the Union\u2019s democratic\nstructures as also reflected in\nthe issues with minutes and\npapers being released.\u201d\nThe current managing\ndirector Jarlath O\u2019Hara and\nthe Union President have\nmade promises to review the\nprocedure at the end of the\nyear.\nof demand through huge\ninfrastructure developments,\nthe only solution for people\non low incomes is to seek\nsocial housing \u2013 the only\noption left available at a\nreasonable price. But with\n1.8 million people currently\non the waiting lists for social\nhousing, and local authorities\nallocating it with a needs-based approach, students are\nvery rarely included in such\nschemes. This leaves only the\nprivate sector.\nBut for students in particular,\nthe private rented sector can\npresent unique challenges and\nbe daunting in its complexity.\nThe astronomical fees that\nletting agents charge, frankly\nodious conditions some\nlandlords expect you to live in\npurely on account of being a\nstudent, and trouble of finding\na guarantor for your tenancy\nagreement can all burden\npeople with unnecessary\nlevels of stress as they house-hunt. In London especially,\nwhere the costs are so inflated\nand continue to soar even\nnow, it feels increasingly like\nwe have no control or voice.\nSchemes such as Share and\nCare and Homeshare UK have\npopped up in recent years\n\u2013 their aim being to match\npeople looking for affordable\naccommodation with elderly\npeople in need of support and\ncompany. Increasing numbers\nof students are turning to\nthem as a solution to see them\nthrough their studies.\nAt Imperial specifically, last\nyear College announced its\nplans to act as a guarantor for\ninternational students seeking\nCan students bear London\u2019s housig crisis?\nStephen Naulls takes you through recent political developments aiming at tackliong the country\u2019s\nhousing crisis while discussing how students are affeted and what they can expect.\nIt\u2019s that time of year again.\nThe \u2018Private Housing Event\u2019\ninvitation has appeared on\nFacebook, your housemates\nare suspiciously quiet about\nthat looming deadline to\nrenew your tenancy, and the\nthought of going through the\nwhole process again makes\nyou even more nauseous than\nthat seventh snakebite you\nhad at Reynolds the previous\nevening.\nAs the number of outright\nhome owners in the U.K. has\nfallen drastically, along with a\nmoderate decline in the social\nrented sector, the number\nof people relying on private\nrenting has risen sharply.\nThere are now more\nthan nine million people\nliving in private rented\naccommodation in England. It\nis neither particularly secure,\nnor financially sensible, and\noften compared to effectively\nburning money. Recently,\nthe number of homeless\nhouseholds in the U.K. has\nrisen to more than 50,000;\nall of this serves as a damning\nindictment of the sheer lack\nof capacity in the housing\nsystem. We desperately need\na long-term solution.\nSo what is the long-term\nsolution? Somebody with\nthe most basic grasp of\neconomics will tell you that\nthere is a failure of the\nbalance between supply and\ndemand in the U.K. housing\nmarket. The position of the\ntwo main political parties, the\nConservatives and Labour, is\nto build 200,000 more homes\nby 2020, but this is juxtaposed\nwith a report published by the\nHouse of Lords, citing a need\nfor 300,000 new homes to\nbe built in this Parliament. No\ngovernment has built enough\nhomes for decades now.\nAs the nation desperately\ngrapples with the need to\nchase the increasing levels\naccommodation from second\nyear onwards \u2013 preventing\nthem from having to pay\nthree to six months of rent in\nadvance. Last year, a large\ngroup of Imperial students\nattended a massive event as\npart of the London Mayoral\nElection in association with\nCitizensUK to quiz candidates\non their pledges for students\ngoing forward.\nOne of the key pledges\ncoming out of the CitizensUK\nevent was Sadiq Khan\u2019s focus\non affordable housing for\nLondoners. Over the next four\nand a half years \u00a33.15 billion\nwill be invested in building\n90,000newhomesspecifically\nin London. Students will be\nparticularly happy to see\nthat 58,000 of these are\nto be reserved as \u2018London\nLiving Wage\u2019 dwellings\ntargeted at people on low\nincomes. Meanwhile, his\n\\\\ There are now\nmore than nine\nmillion people living\nin private rented\naccommodation in\nEngland \\\\\n\\\\ No government\nhas built enough\nhomes for decades\nnow\\\\\nThe private rental sector has grown substantially over the past decade.\nHouseholds by tenure, share of the total 1991-2013/14 \\\\ parliament.uk\ndraft Supplementary Planning\nGuidance aims to streamline\nthe planning process for new\nhousing projects. All of this\nis long overdue to deal with\nthe problems Londoners face,\nand more needs to be done\nto ensure students are able\nto claim their fair share of the\nnew homes.\nThe housing crisis is a\ndeeply-rooted issue in our\nsociety \u2013 the result of decades\nof under-investment in new\ndevelopments. Students\nhave been forced to burden\nan unfair share of the\nconsequences that stem from\nthis. But hope may be on the\nhorizon, with our new Mayor\npledging to deliver genuinely\naffordable homes for all\nLondoners. I can only hope all\nstudents are included in that\ntoo.\n\\\\ Last year College\nannounced its\nplans to act as\na guarantor for\ninternational\nstudents \\\\\nKhan Sadiq solve the housing crisis? \\\\ Dionisos Olympian\n\n"

The\nCouncil is the democratic medium\nfor ordinary students to propose and\nvote for union policies. The Chair is\nresponsible for governing the flow\nof information between the Council\nand the Officer Trustees. However,\nthe current lack of awareness and\nintimidating atmosphere of Council\nmeetings does not facilitate appropriate\nrepresentation of the student body.\nAs Chair, I would strive to reshape the\nCandidate Manifestos: Council Chair\nstructure of the council and improve\nthese limitations. I\u2019ve been the\nAcademic Representative of my\ncourse for the past two years and was\na member of the Student Council in\nmy school for four. I believe that these\npositions have given me appropriate\nexperience in voicing the opinions of\nthe student population to authority\nfigures. If elected, I would deal with the\nproblem of intimidation by bridging\nthe gap between the student body and\nthe Council. In order to achieve this, I\nsuggest putting in place a simple and\nanonymous platform for students to\npropose their motions. Additionally, I\nRoy Tal Dew would conduct meetings in smaller\ngroups to create a more open\natmosphere where students could\nmore comfortably approach council\nmembers. I believe that these changes\nwould incentivise input across the entire\nuniversity rather than being restricted to\nthe loudest voices.\nLastly, I hope to raise awareness about\nthe Council by advertising important\ninformation on social media, such as\nFacebook. I\u2019m confident this would\nprovide the average student with a\nbetter understanding of union policy-making.\nToo long has Felix drained the union\ndry for unnecessary funds that could\nbe used elsewhere, and does anybody\nactually read Felix for any reason\nother than the puzzles section?

Like most recent\nadaptations, Riverdale also\ngoes for a darker and edgier\nfeel; however in this case,\nthis approach pulls off and\nactually works spectacularly\nwell.\nRiverdale is based upon the\nArchie Comics, which was a\nfun light-hearted series about\nthe general lives of different\nteenagers in a small town\ncalled Riverdale. The Archie\nComics are probably most\nwell known for their spin-offs,\nJosie and the Pussycats and\nSabrina the Teenage Witch.\nThe stories told were fairly\ncolorful and comedic, making\nup for their lack of depth with\nan entertainment factor.\nIf you stop and think about\nit, a completely faithful adaptation ran the risk of being\nstale or uninspiring. Riverdale\ntakes the comic series and\ncharacters and gives it its own\nspin, which gives the show\nan extra layer of complexity,\nwhile still resembling the original material enough to be\nconsidered an adaptation.\nThe characters are written\nway deeper than their one-di-mensional portrayals in the\ncomics. At the centre of the\nshow is Archie Andrews, an\nattractive red-haired student\n(who we see shirtless a\nnumber of times), who wants\nto become a musician whilst\nstruggling to maintain an illicit\nrelationship with his music\nteacher. Rather than being\nportrayed as a clumsy, humorous everyman, this version is\nmore driven, uncertain and\nworld-weary. Betty Cooper\nis still the cute girl next door,\nbut one with an overbearing mother and struggles\nwith perfectionism. She in\nparticular, plays off brilliantly\nwith Veronica Lodge, who\u2019s\ntrying to move past the rich-girl personality she\u2019s known\nfor in the comics. Reggie\nMantle is still a tool, but hey,\nthere\u2019s gotta be that one jock\nwho don\u2019t care about.\nThe overarching story\nrevolves around the murder\nof a student, Jason Blossoms and the circumstances\nsurrounding his death. This\nplot point forms the glue of\nthe show, driving several\ncharacters together and\nputting them into contact, and\noften conflict with each other.\nWe learn several secrets and\nmysteries from practically all\nthe characters, and it is this\nmystery that keeps us craving\nthe instalment so that we get\nall the answers. Sometimes\nthings may happen just to\nmove the plot forward but it\u2019s\nonly a minor point, and one\nonly notice if you really pay\nattention.\nAn interesting little titbit is\nhow diverse the show is and\nhow it tries to reflect and\nprovide some commentary on\nreal life. We see a young gay\nman, open up about himself\nand his feelings; we see\nArchie get called on for his\nwhite privilege when he wants\nto help the all-black Pussycats\nband write some of their\nsongs. In one episode, there\u2019s\na frank discussion on the\nimpact of slut-shaming as well\nas how it may affect some of\nthe victims. What\u2019s really nice\nis that none of these moments\never feel forced or present\njust to fill a quota, but rather,\nare naturally woven into the\nCareful you don\u2019t cut yourself on all that\nedge \\\\ The CW\nplot to subtly get the message\nacross. As a high-school\ndrama, it\u2019s appreciated that\nthis series is more reflective of\ncurrent times and society.\nAt the end of the day,\nmost of the characters are\nteenagers, so this is largely a\nhigh-school drama. For some\npeople, that\u2019s not really an\nissue but if you\u2019re the kind of\nperson who wanted to get\naway from all that, this show\nmay not be for you. I\u2019ve read\nA kind of Dynamic Duo \\\\ The CW\nsomewhere online that this\nshow is described as \u201cTwin\nPeaks with attractive people\u201d.\nI can honestly say that is the\ncase; sure there\u2019s the mystery\nand intrigue, but there\u2019s also\na fair amount of fan service.\nIn fact now that I think about\nit, I\u2019m sure practically every\nrelevant character is really\nattractive in some shape or\nform. I suppose you can\u2019t\nreally get everything right\nabout high school.\nRiverdale is a very much\n\u2018CW\u2019 take on the Archie\nComics; but it is one with\ninteresting mythos and strong\nacting, with some shocking\nstory developments thrown\nin here and there. While\nseeing old characters with a\ntwist may be a bit jarring and\neven though we\u2019re a few episodes into the first season, it\ndefinitely looks as though\nviewers are in for a\nwild and engaging\nride.\n\\\\ If you stop and\nthink about it, a\ncompletely faithful\nadaptation ran the\nrisk of being stale \\\\\n\\\\ As a high-school\ndrama, it\u2019s appreciated that this series\nis more reflective of\ncurrent times \\\\\n\n"

If any of my dedicated\nreaders are wondering where\nI have been for the past couple\nof weeks, unfortunately I am not\nlegally allowed to say due to the\ncase still being in court, however,\nI can tell you that it rhymes with\nhexual sarassment. Honestly just a\nbunch of uptight liberals being so\nentrenched up their own asses that\nthey\u2019re just too frigid for their own\ngood.\nOf course big papi Trump has\nbeen continuously slandered for\nthe past couple of weeks for no\napparent reason \u2013 It was a ban on\nterrorists, not Muslims. If you had\nactually read the executive order\nthen you would known that! Also\nthe whole \u2018he\u2019s not my president!\u2019\nvibe has gotten old and we should\nfinally come together and become\na unified nation. Apart from the\nblacks and lesbians of course.\nFrom one crooked election to\nanother, the Imperial College\nUnion elections have started, or\nso I hear. It looks like this year\u2019s\ncollection of people too inept for\na real job and medicine students\nwho have run out of money for the\nlast years of their degree promises\nto be the most uneventful election\nto date. If I were to predict who\nwould win, I would come to the\nopinion that no-one gives a shit, as\nlong as the hot ones win.\nDid anyone watch the Oscars?\nYeah me neither \u2013 if I wanted to\nlisten to the liberal elite complain\nabout a fairly elected leader, I\nwould read this tampon of a news-paper. I did hear about the utter\ntravesty of political correctness,\nhowever, which didn\u2019t surprise\nme, but still made me shit blood\nregardless. What a surprise that\nthe Hollywood elite couldn\u2019t just\nlet a good film win. It had to be\nthe SJW festival of black homos\njust to prove that they\u2019re not racist\n\u2013 how about just admit it and\nmove on? That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done\nand it means I don\u2019t have to watch\nmoody two hour dramas about\nknown homosexuals crying, or\nwhatever they do. I was surprised,\nhowever, because I thought that\nblack people couldn\u2019t be homosexuals \u2013 or is it that they can\u2019t\nswim? Anyway, Lala Land is not\noverrated and should have won,\nand it\u2019s good to be back.\nI\nf any of you remember, when\nI wrote my last column, I\nhad been intent on living\nin isolation for the next few\nyears. However, I don\u2019t think\nanyone actually makes it past\nthe naked people in the centrefold,\nso who knows if anyone actually\nread that. Anyway, needless to\nsay, my self-enforced isolation kind\nof came to a halt when I realised\nthat I had forgotten to bring any\ncoconut water for hydration,\ninstead I had to suck from the\nteat of the sheep I brought with\nme. However, I may have sucked\nits (gender is as fluid as sheep\nmilk so please don\u2019t forget your\npronouns) whole body dry. Well,\nas a result, I may have ended up\ninadvertently killing the sheep and\nafter a few days dead goat really\nstarts to stink out the place. If I had\nremembered to bring my vegan\npot pourri with me then I could\nhave perhaps dealt with it, but\nunfortunately I bought four copies\nof No Logo instead. Oh well.\nNow that isolating myself from\nthe real world has failed, I have\ndecided to fully embrace change\nand somehow cope with the next\ncouple of years by learning to\ntake comfort in the little joys in life\n\u2013 like the fact that the overrated\nwhite-centric La La Land had their\nbest picture Oscar wrenched out\nof their white-privileged-jazz-bro\nhands in order to give it to the\nsuperior film that is Moonlight.\nNow, although I was born in\nCambridge to a local MP, that film\nmade me wish that I was a known\nhomosexual, that I was a muscled\nblack man, and that my mother\nhad a crack cocaine addiction. I\njust have always identified more\nwith African culture than my own,\nand if in the future the opportunity\nto become black became available\nto me I would take it faster than\nyou could call me Rachel Dolezal.\nAnother thing to take happiness\nfrom is the fact that when the\npolar ice caps eventually melt, we\nwill no longer have to contend\nwith the alt-right, racism, gourmet\nburger places that don\u2019t give you\nchips when you buy a burger as\nif they\u2019re some sort of side dish,\nvegan fried chicken restaurants (if\nyou want to be vegan, don\u2019t try to\npretend to be all high and mighty\nwhen you\u2019re just trying to replace\nchicken), and also sheep. I get triggered every time I see one now, so\nplease put trigger warnings on any\nfarmyard related posts in future\nplease.\nMy plan failed and also\nI\u2019m triggered by sheep\nnow\nJonathan Masters\u2019 plan to\nrelinquish this world sadly failed,\nbut now he is back to rejoice from\nthe defeat of La La Land\nI\u2019m back to liberate\nmy column from\nforeign oppression\nMonathan Jasters is back to show\nyou what\u2019s up and shit all over\nICU\u2019s elections and the Oscars\namong other things\nS\nV\n* Sponsored by\nThe O\nscars\n\n"

An insiders view\nshows that it\u2019s sometimes a bit more\nsuperficial, but you\u2019ll still probably\nbe jealous at the end, sorry.\nG\nosh, what a\nmorning, I\nthought to\nmyself as I\nlanded on a\nlush, green,\nvelvet chair, flushed and out\nof breath from an intense\npower walking session down\nPark Lane (my definition of\nbeing \u2018fashionably late\u2019).\nA fellow blogger sitting\nopposite was doing her 5th\nre-run on Snapchat: \u201c\u2026it\u2019s\ntoo early in the morning to\ndo this without a filter\u2026\u201d\nOther bloggers purred at\neach other, exchanging\ndelicate kisses on cheeks and\nInstagram-perfect smiles.\nIt is always events like this\nthat makes my inner introvert\nfeel... out of place. My combination of typical Chinese\nfeatures, black hair, small\neyes and all, was an anomaly\namongst the sea of blonde\nhair, bronzed cheeks and lips\ntinted with the most-hyped\nMLBB (My Lips But Better)\ncolour on Youtube. Being a\nthird year Chemical Engineering student at Imperial didn\u2019t\nhelp either \u2013 conversations\nwere better kept away from\na 20-year old\u2019s daunting\ncoursework deadlines and\nback to London Fashion Week\nand brand-sponsored trips\nabroad.\nThis morning wasn\u2019t any\ndifferent from the rest of the 8\nam press breakfasts scribbled\nin my schedule. Except for a\nchange in environment. I was\nsitting in Boisdale of Mayfair\non North Row, a restaurant\nserving British food, a rarity\nin the area. The room, converted from a listed stable,\nwas decorated in their distinc-tive, classy interior of red and\ndark green walls, chandeliers\nand mahogany tables.\nAfter catching up with the\nlatest restaurant openings\nand Trump\u2019s rants on Twitter, I\nescaped from the crazy world\noutside to study the breakfast\nmenu in an elegant, black,\nart deco font: lobster eggs\nbenedict, haggis, Devonshire\ncrab omelettes, devilled veal\nkidneys. A pancake menu\nwas also available in time\nfor Pancake Day, featuring\nsmoked salmon, scrambled\nduck eggs all the way to dry\naged sirloin steak (yes, on\npancakes). Interesting.\nThe waitress, slightly flustered by the never-ending\nbuzz of demands from the\nonly table that morning, took\nour orders and left us to continue on the blogger chit chat\nfor another half-hour.\nThe food arrived when the\ncaffeine had finally seeped\ninto my brain. What followed\nwas the scene that you\u2019ll\nnever, ever see through that\nstatic, photoshopped square\non Instagram.\nLike any other event, I was\nready for their arrival \u2013 my\ntrusty DSLR on my right, my\niPhone logged on to Instagram Story mode on my left.\nI was, of course, not the only\none. The table of bloggers\nall stood up like meerkats,\nphones and cameras ready,\nmaking way for the breakfast\nplates, pushing away stained\nnapkins and water glasses,\nfighting for the spot with the\nbest natural light, positioning\nthe food for the perfect #flat-lay shot.\nPerfectly poached Burford\nBrown eggs were carefully\nsliced open to reveal that\nriver of bright orange #yolk-porn. An artistically cut ruby\ngrapefruit was shuffled across\nthe table to give that contrasting pop of colour against the\ngreen crushed avocado and\nbuttercup yellow hollandaise\nsauce. You could hear shutter\nsounds from the cameras, like\na machine gun shooting at\nthe beautiful plate of smoked\nsalmon crepes that was\nordered \u201cjust for photos\u201d.\nThis continued for another\n10 minutes until each social\nmedia account was satisfied.\nBy then, the food has gone\ncold, per usual. I picked up\nmy knife and fork, slicing the\ncaramelized banana on my\nhazelnut praline pancake.\nThe spongy pancake had\nsoaked up the melted vanilla\nice cream, still delicious\ndespite the prolonged photo-shooting session.\nThe meal phased out as\nfellow bloggers began to rush\noff for their next event. Shame\n\u2013 half the dishes were left\nunfinished. A typical #tablesit-uation in the blogging world.\nAnd a typical snapshot of\nmy morning from the eyes of\na blogger.\n\\\\ The table of\nbloggers all stood\nup like meerkats,\nphones and cameras\nready, making way\nfor the breakfast\nplates \\\\\nThe ugly truth behind food waste\nSadly, it has to be said that we are\na wasteful species - and this is often\nmost apparent on our plates. We\u2019ve\ngot some ideas as to how you can\nchange that, and why you should\nbother doing so.\nT\nhere is no way\nof denying it: we\noverproduce.\nConstantly. We\nthrow. Shamelessly.\nWe waste.\nConsciously. Every day,\ntonnes of food are thrown\naway simply because some\nfood legislation has put a\nstandardized limit \u2018eat before\u2019\ndate or due to surplus. Worse,\nbecause we buy more than\nwe really need. However,\nfor catering companies,\nrestaurants and caf\u00e9s, for\nwhich food waste is a daily\nissue, acknowledging it is still\nsomething inconsiderable. As\nif by admitting a truth we all\nknow \u2013 although we refuse\nto believe it ourselves \u2013 it\nwould expose them to shame,\ncustomers\u2019 disapproval and\nultimately to bankruptcy.\nIt is outrageous how our\nmodern society, one of\noverproduction and fierce\nconsumerism, has allowed\nsuch a phenomenon to build\nin throughout the past years.\nThe more we produce, the\nmore extra we produce.\nCompetition between brands\nhas led to overproduction\nat minimal costs, with little\nbenefit to the companies who\nfirst started this strategy. The\nconsumers themselves \u2013 that\nis, us \u2013 are not left untouched\neither, constantly manipulated by massive advertising\ncampaigns and never-ending\nvarieties to choose from,\nproducing a crowd that is\ncompletely lost in the ocean\nof quantity \u2013 often over qual-ity, but that is another story to\nbe told.\nThe saying goes, \u2018you are\nwhat you eat\u2019. It isn\u2019t about\nbeing a foodie; it\u2019s about\nbeing an educated, responsible one. You cannot pretend\nto be passionate about food\nwithout considering the food\nchain as a whole and measuring its impact not only on our\nsociety, but on our ecosystem\nas a whole. How about what\nwe don\u2019t eat, about what we\nguiltlessly throw away? It\nseems so ironic how students\noften complain about tiny\nbudgets when so much of\ntheir grocery shopping goes\nto waste. On a low budget,\nwe tend to choose quantity\nover quality, and students are\nthe first victims of this vicious\ncycle. Bigger packages offer\ndeals that outcompete any\nindividual offer. Yet, I spend\nless than any of my friends\non food. Around \u00a310, up\nto \u00a315 a week. That\u2019s right,\none five. Fair enough, I\nam vegetarian with vegan\naspirations; I am a not-that-tall (hey not so-short-either\nthough) girl. But let\u2019s look at\nit from another perspective.\nI tend to go for high quality\nproducts, organic whenever\nI can. Moreover, I love nuts.\nI\u2019m absolutely nuts about\nnuts. And my favourite way of\nspending a chill evening is to\nbake. All these should significantly increase the cost of my\nshopping list, and hence counterbalance the advantages of\nmy diet.\nSo how to minimize your\nfood expenses without\nstarving yourself? There is\nno secret to it. Only rational\nthinking, which most of us, as\nscientists, would be expected\nto have. And a relentless\nwill to radically change our\ncurrent mentality. Start with\nSarah Kakadellis\nbuying local, and seasonal.\nStrawberries in February will\nof course cost you thrice as\nmuch as they would in June,\nif not more. Choose your\nproducts yourself, rather than\nalready packaged. You\u2019d be\namazed to see how cheaper\nthe very same tomatoes are\nwhen you pick them alone.\nBuy \u2018simple\u2019, non-processed\nfood. It\u2019s not that hard to\nmake your own morning porridge with basic ingredients\nrather than buy the \u2018ready\nto eat\u2019 package. Besides,\ndoesn\u2019t food taste so much\nbetter when it is homemade?\nThis article isn\u2019t about dictating the lifestyle you ought\nto adopt. Mine alone is far\nfrom being perfect. It is about\nraising questions. About starting to be aware of what we\nconsume, or rather how we\ndo so. Last year I joined an\napp that shares leftovers by\na means of bringing the local\ncommunity together and preventing food waste. I realized\none thing, a simple equation:\nsharing food equals sharing\nhappiness. It feels like you\nwon the lottery when you pick\nup free food from someone\nelse. It feels even better when\nyou give away what you\nwould otherwise throw away\nand there is this feeling of\nachievement too. By putting\nin common what one wants to\nget rid of when someone else\ncraves for the same thing,\na whole common project of\nsustainability emerges. And\nthere is nothing more empowering than building a more\nsustainable future together.\nBefore you chuck your\nwrinkly apples, why don\u2019t you\ngive them another chance\nand treat yourself or your\nfriends with a delicious apple\ncrumble or turn the potatoes\nand carrots that have been\nlying around for way too long\ninto a creamy carrot soup?\nThese recipes will fill your\npalate and your mind \u2013 as\nwell as your wallet \u2013 with\njoy. And next time you see\nthat really tempting offer\nat the shop, think about all\nthe yummy food at home\nthat still waits to be eaten\nwith love. For the love of our\nplanet, start sharing food and\npreventing food waste. Food\ntastes much better when it is\nshared \u2013 or when it is free.\nApple and cinnamon oat\ncrumble\n6-8 apples (wrinkly apples most\nwelcome)\n1 cup flour\nmodernfamer.com\n1 cup jumbo oats\n1 cup sugar (brown for more\nflavoured crumble)\n1/3 cup room-temperature butter\n(salted or not, whatever\u2019s in the\nfridge) in cubes\n1 tsp ground cinnamon\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n1. Preheat the oven to\n180\u00b0C/350F/Gas 4.\n2. Place the flour, sugar\nand oats in a large bowl and\nmix well. Add a few drops of\nvanilla extract. Add the cubes\nof butter and rub into the\nflour mixture. Keep rubbing\nuntil the mixture resembles\nbreadcrumbs.\n3. Peel and core the apple\nand cut into cubes, about the\nsize of a big thumb. Place the\nfruit in an ovenproof dish and\nsprinkle the crumble base on\ntop.\n4. Bake in the oven for\n20-35 minutes until the\ncrumble is browned and\nthe fruit mixture bubbling.\nServe warm with thick cream,\ncustard or ice cream, or just\nenjoy plain.\n\n"

The\nPresidential roles of the RCSU\nand RSMU are uncontested.\nOn the plus side, we\u2019re\nseeing a spike of interest in\nthe Liberation roles, including\ntwo candidates contesting\nthe newly established\nMental Health Officer role.\nAndriopoulos said: \u201cOne of\nthe most pleasing things about\nthis set of elections is the\nnumber of candidates running\nfor Liberation Officer roles,\nwhich now includes the new\nMental Health Officer.

On the other hand, no\none actually ran for Deputy\nPresident for Finance and\nServices in the first round of\nelections last year.\nThis year in comparison,\nthere are only 21 students\nrunning for sabbatical\npositions. From those, only\nthirteen can realistically be\nconsideredseriouscandidates.\nParticularly in the case of\nUnion President, arguably\nthe most prestigious role\navailable, only one candidate\nhas bothered supplying a\nheadshot or a manifesto, with\nthe rest having presumably\nmissed the deadline. Though\nsince, four candidates have\noficially pulled out of the race.\nWe reached out to them to\nenquire on the reasons behind\ntheir incomplete campaign\nbut have not received any\ncomment.Whether this will\nwork to the advantage of the\ncandidate who has provided\na manifesto, or to their\ndetriment, causing a RON (re-opening of nominations) vote\ncascade remains to be seen.\nUnion President, Nas\nAndriopoulos said: \u201cAll of the\nsabbatical roles, including\nICSMSU President and\nFELIX, are contested and\nhave some strong candidates\nfrom various backgrounds\nwithin the Union. Following\nlast year\u2019s bumper crop of\ncandidates, I am saddened\nthat more students have not\nnominated themselves, and I\nam especially disappointed\nthat more of the Presidential\ncandidates did not submit a\nmanifesto.

From people\nplugged in on their\ndaily commutes, to the seas\nof smartphones at concerts,\nwe seem to be constantly\nimmersed in gadgetry. But\nis that a good or bad thing?\nThis question has become\nsomething of a hot topic in\nrecent months, with shows\nsuch as Westworld and Black\nMirror exploring the darker\nconsequences of a future\ndominated by technology.\nChoreographer Blanca\nLi takes a more playful\napproach with Robot, a\nproduction filled with dancers\nboth human and humanoid.\nIt's an interesting premise.\nSure, robots can perform\ncalculations with superhuman speed and precision\n\u2013 Google's AlphaGo AI\nhas even beaten us at Go\n\u2013 but how will they fare\nwith something as uniquely\nhuman as dancing? Surely\ncreative expression remains\nvery much our domain.\nUnfortunately, Robot doesn't\ndeliver on its potential for an\ninteresting dialogue between\nhumans and robots; whatever message Li intended\nto convey is lost somewhere between the strange\nsequences, and the dance\npieces that went on for longer\nthan they should have.\nIn all fairness, the\neight human dancers\nperformed with\nskill and ease;\ntheir stamina\nfor carrying\nsuch energetic\nmoves for\nover an hour\nwas quite\ncommend-able. But\ndespite the\nenergetic\nchoreogra-phy, the moves\nfelt rather\nmonotonous and\nrepetitive \u2013 dare I\nsay, robotic?\nRobot's selling point is its\ngenerous use of actual robots.\nThe orchestra is self-playing,\ncomposed of 10 mechanical\ninstruments by Japanese art\ngroup Maywa Denki. The\nmusical prototypes are rather\nwhimsical: percussion instruments dominate, although\nthere is a flower-shaped\nmarimba and an automated\nconcertina (which produced\na dreadful screeching note).\nWhile the soundtrack, composed by Tao Guti\u00e9rrez, was\nquite enjoyable in parts, after\nhalf an hour of drumbeats\nand mechanical beeping\nit started to become quite\nheadache-inducing.\nThe Nao robots were\ndefinitely the selling point of\nRobot. Infantile, with round\nfaces and LED eyes blinking\nClaire Chan\nRobot was on at the Barbican\nfrom the 22nd\n\u2013 25th\nFebruary\nBlanca Li Dance Company, Robot \\\\ A\nJerocki\nconfusedly around, they\nseemed designed to appeal\nto our tendency to anthro-pomorphosise electronic\ndevices. Nao #1 was gently\nhelped out of his box by one\nof the dancers, like a parent\nteaching a child his or her first\nsteps. They then performed a\nshort dance together, with the\ndancer lifting the tiny robot\nabove his head in an amusing\npas de deux.\nThis was followed by a choreographed routine carried\nout entirely by seven Nao\nmodels. Or rather, the Nao\nrobots made a brave attempt\nat finishing their routine, only\nto fall down every few moves\nand struggle back to their\nfeet. This delighted the audi-ence, with every new tumble\neliciting coos and \u2018aahs\u2019.\nWas it intentional, or were\nthe Nao robots genuinely\nincapable of keeping their\nbalance? If the former, catering to the audience\u2019s desire\nto see robots as harmless\nand bumbling would have\nbeen some clever lampshad-ing by Li. However, I rather\nsuspect that it was down\nto the limitations of current\nrobot-dancing technology\nrather than any intention by\nthe choreographer.\nAs the production wore\non, it all struck me as a tad\njuvenile \u2013 the cutely inept\nNaos, the low-tech mechanical orchestra, the human\ndancers who seemed to\nplay second string to the\ndancing robots. Finally,\nthe curtains closed\non a giant tangle of\nmachinery \u2013 variously blinking,\nbeeping, and\nbumping into\neach other. A\nstray Roomba\nwandered\nto the edge\nof the stage,\nand was left\noutside when the\ncurtains closed.\nBy the end of the\nperformance, I felt\njust as confused.\nBlanca Li Dance Company, Robot\n\\\\ Laurent Philippe\n\\\\ I suspect that the\nrobots' instability\nwas down to\nthe limitations\nof current robot-dancing technology\nrather than any\nintention by the\nchoreographer \\\\\n\n"

Hosted by a\ndifferent university each year\nand run with the assistance\nof our governing body (the\nBritish Octopush Association),\nthe student nationals see\nthe best underwater hockey\nteams from around the\ncountry battle head to head\nto secure the title of national\nchampions. With Plymouth A\nteam wearing t-shirts boasting\nof their six consecutive wins,\nthe pressure was on.\nAs a fast growing sport here\nat Imperial, our team was\nnovice heavy. This meant\nthe tournament saw several\ndebutants during official\nmatches, which vary from\ngames we play during training with three referees for\nevery game: two water refs\nand one land ref, watching\nfrom above the water. Every\nplayer\u2019s moves are under\nscrutiny, trying to withhold\nthe non-contact aspects of\nplay, although after a fin or\ntwo to the face you will soon\nrealise this is not a sport for\nthe delicate. Despite the refs\ncommunicating by signs indicating rules akin to football,\neven including the off-side\nrule, the pool was anything\nbut quiet. As a 50 metre competition pool it was split into\nfour areas: three games were\nplayed simultaneously, each\nwith their own set of splashes\nand cheers over goals, and\nthe warm-up area had its\nown intense atmosphere as\ncaptains tried to coach their\nlast few tactics between\ngames. This allowed for\njust under 100 games to be\nplayed throughout the day,\nwith our team competing in\nan exhausting ten of them.\nAs none of us had ever\ncompeted at this level\nbefore, we started with low\nexpectations. We were very\nmuch there to learn from the\nother teams and soak up\nsome experience, but were\npleased to hold up a fair\ngame against several teams.\nPlaying against some GB\nplayers, every single goal\nwas a great achievement.\nDrawing in our final game,\nwe finished the tournament in\nhigh-spirits, with high hopes\nfor next year as we continue\nto improve, having come on\nICAmericanFootball|Divisonchamps\nGatis Ogle\nin a 6-2 tie. Due to having the\nundoubtedly best scores, both\non offense and defense, the\ntie was broken in our favour,\nhanding us the 1A South East\nconference title along with\na 3rd\nseed in the play-offs, a\nhome game at #FortHarling-ton and a hangover to start\nthe week.\nLook for us on www.face-book.com/ImmortalsAFC/ for\nupdates or if you\u2019ve decided\nto join the champions and\n#BecomeImmortal for the next\nseason. #HustleHitNeverQuit\nA\nfter a season-long fight,\nit all boiled\ndown to the\nlast Sunday\nof the regular\nseason. To be or not to be,\nit\u2019s now or never: all three\nplay-off qualifiers (Imperial\nImmortals, Cambridge\nPythons and Kent Falcons)\ncould come out top of the\ndivision if the day went their\nway.\nWhile our play-off rivals\nhad a game between them,\nwe travelled to Royal Holloway to face their Bears. The\ncoming spring had brought\nan end to their hibernation,\nand the 0-7 team were giving\ntough resistance to teams that\nused to walk over them just\nbefore the Christmas break.\nWe had to fight to not hand\nthem their first win of the\nseason.\nAnd fight we did. After a\nshort offensive drive and a\npunt on the Royal Holloway\npart, the ball was handed to\nImmortals offense. Having\nfound their footing in the\nprevious 46-0 victory against\nthe then-reigning Pythons,\nthe offense gained five to\nten yards per carry faster\nthan the Bears could blink.\nIn no time at all the ball\nended up in the notoriously\ngrabby hands of Josemi\n(is it pronounced Hosemi?\nYosemi? You choose!) in RHUL\nendzone after a gorgeous\n30-yard pass. 6-0.\nImmortals defense proved\nwhy they\u2019re the best in the\nleague and forced a three-and-out, officially giving\nRHUL offense less action than\nyou can get at an average\nsports night. Ball returned\nto Immortals offense, which\nslowly but surely moved\nforwards until the very beginning of the second quarter\nwhen Jason made me recycle\nhis old \u201cKill\u2019em\u201d nickname\nby doing exactly what it says\non the tin. After waiting for\nan appropriately-equipped\nambulance due to a suspected neck injury on RHUL\nside, the game was called\n6-0 to us. Thankfully, Will the\nBear does not seem to have\nsuffered any lasting injury,\nand we sincerely wish him a\nspeedy recovery.\nAfter this rather sombre\nwin, we tuned into Kent-Cambridge to witness a Falcons\nvictory, meaning all three of\ntop division teams ended up\nleaps and bounds since our\nfirst tournament last term\nand continuously recruiting\nnew players to our Thursday\nevening training sessions at\nETHOS (8pm-10pm).\nLast but not least, we were\nrewarded with an after-party\nin the evening, an opportunity\nto let our hair down out of our\nridiculous-looking hats and\nget to know the other teams.\nWe quickly became close to\nOxford, who we had played\na friendly against only a few\ndays before.

The\nyacht club then engaged ICG\nin the hopes of delivering\nsystematic strategies to offer\nbetter services to its members.\nThe collaboration process\nstarted with a kickstart\nmeeting between yacht club\ncommittee and ICG consult-ants. During the meeting, the\nyacht club\u2019s operations were\npresented to ICG to better\nunderstand the existing issues\nand objectives.\nSince then, the consultants\nhave worked on the project\ncollaboratively and updated\nthe yacht club committee\nthrough frequent discussions.\nThe ICG consultants have also\nreceived training and mentorship from L.E.K. Consulting, a\nleading global strategy consulting firm. Despite startimg\nwith modest consulting back-grounds, the ICG consultants\nquickly picked up the skill set\nalong the project.\nDuring the project, ICG\nfirst conducted the feasibility\nstudy of delivering the Royal\nYachting Association (RYA)\nyachting courses to Imperial\nstudents. Offering yachting\ncourses is an important part\nof the development strategy\nas it adds a new source of\nincome to the club. ICG then\nproposed a roadmap of introducing the RYA course based\non different costs and human\nresources options. According\nto the plan, by delivering the\ncourses the yacht club itself\nwill become an RYA-certified\ntraining centre, able to conduct yacht trainings globally.\nThe consultants then focused\non membership study and\nbranding analysis for the\nyacht club. Consultants compared the yacht club against\nother sports clubs at Imperial\nand other UK universities in\norder to understand the relative position of the yacht club.\nAn indicative survey, which\nreceived over 110 responds,\nrevealed the yacht club\u2019s\npublic perception in areas\nsuch as the quality of activ-ities, membership cost, trip\nprices, social media commu-nications, and etc. Although\nseen as an expensive sport,\nmany students are interested\nin yachting and are willing to\ngive it a try.\nIn order to understand how\nyacht clubs are operated\nin other top universities,\nthe yacht club arranged an\ninterview for ICG with Dr Paul\nWedrich, the former vice-com-modore of Cambridge\nUniversity Yacht Club. During\nthe meeting Dr Wedrich\ntalked about the history of the\nCambridge University Yacht\nClub, and how the club devel-oped, step by step, towards\nowning two yachts, and generating an annual turnover\nover \u00a3100,000. The interview\nwas obviously inspiring, but\nalso implied the importance\nof development strategy for\na student club. Nevertheless,\nthe interview seeded the\ngoodwill of yachting collaborations in the future between\nCambridge and Imperial.\nLastly, ICG developed a\nfive-year growth strategy for\nthe yacht club based on the\ninsights from the investigations\nand analysis. After approximately ten weeks, the final\ndeliverables of the consulting\nproject were organised and\nformally presented to the\nyacht club\u2019s committee. Some\nof the highlights of the five-year growth strategy include\nthe offering of yachting day\ntrips, more competitive membership fee and reasonable\npricings.\nYacht club\u2019s president was\nthrilled with the results and\ndescribed it as \u201ca wonderful\nsuccess\u201d and that it \u201cshines a\nlight on the yacht club\u2019s future\ndevelopment\u201d. After the\nsuccessful presentation, consultants from the project were\noffered committee positions\nwithin the yacht club. In the\nyacht club\u2019s general opinion,\nthey are the right talents to\nlead the implementation of\nthe study results. One consultant has already accepted\nthe offer, and commented\nthat \u201cit will be an entirely\nnew experience to join the\nclient side, but we will learn\nto adapt and create values\nwhere possible.\u201d\nThe yacht club has already\nstarted implementing the\nstrategies. Their racing\nteam, Team Imperial, is\nparticipating in the world\u2019s\nbiggest student regatta in\nFrance this April. Also, an\ninitial collaboration with the\nCambridge University Yacht\nClub is likely to launch next\nacademic year, focusing on\nyachting trainings. Meanwhile, ICG has started its\nsecond-round spring projects.\nICG is actively seeking\nconsulting projects from\nsocieties within the Imperial\nUnion, hoping to provide aid\nto any issues ranging from\nlong term growth plans to\nfeasibility studies, offering\nvalue through students with\nvaried backgrounds and\nperspectives.\nTo learn more about Imperial College Yacht Club and\nImperial Consulting Group,\nplease do visit the respective\nwebsites below:\nImperial College Yacht\nClub: https://www.union.ic.ac.\nuk/acc/yacht/\nImperial Consulting Group:\nhttps://icglondon.com/\n\\\\ A wonderful\nsuccess ...

Worry not \u2013\nhabitable, pristine, Trumpless,\nplanets are coming soon to\ngalaxies near you (perhaps).\nIndeed, a newly-discovered\nsolar system just 39 light\nyears from Earth contains\nplanets that are possibly\nwarm enough to sustain water\nand life.\nThese have been found\naround a small star in the\nconstellation of Aquarius,\nTrappist-1, presenting the first\ntime in history that so many\nEarth-sized planets have been\nfound in orbit around the\nsame star. This star has the\ncharacteristic of being small\nand cold, hence allowing the\nseven closely-packed planets\nthat orbit around it to have\nremarkably moderate temper-atures. Their sizes vary from\n25% smaller to 10% larger\nthan the Earth.\nThis discovery, completely\nunexpected, has thrilled\nmany, as it has raised hopes\nthat the hunt for alien life\nbeyond the solar system\nF\nact: humans are 90%\nstardust.\nHuman beings are\nmostly made up of\nwater, with a few\nother bits and pieces\nthrown in for good measure.\nThat means we are largely\nmade of Hydrogen atoms,\nfollowed by lots of Oxygen, a\nfair bit of Carbon, some Nitrogen and a sprinkling of some\nmore interesting stuff.\nImmediately after the big\nbang, the only elements\nthat existed were Hydrogen\nand Helium: everything else\nwas formed over billions of\nyears as a product of fusion\nreactions (when two atoms\nfuse together to make a\nsingle heavier atom). These\nfusion reactions take place\nin stars, producing heavier\nelements such as Oxygen,\nNitrogen and Carbon, as well\nas recycling lots of Hydrogen. The really heavy atoms\n\u2013 think Gold and Silver \u2013\nrequire something a bit more\ndramatic, and are made only\nduring the massive energy\nrelease of supernovas.\nSo all those familiar\nelements \u2013 Calcium in your\nbones and Iron in your blood\n\u2013 are just bits of leftover\nstardust made in great balls\nof fire billions of years ago.\nIt\u2019s enough to make you feel\njust a little bit special.\nAnother one of Mr. Aran\nShaunak\u2019s Little Bites of\nScience\nMysun\nandstars\ncould start much sooner than\nanticipated. Ignas Snellen, an\nastrophysicist at the Leiden\nObservatory in the Netherlands said \u201cThis is really\nsomething new. When they\nstarted this search several\nyears ago, I really thought\nit was a waste of time. I was\nvery, very wrong\u201d.\nAstronomers are now focusing on using current space\ntechnology, including the\nHubble and NASA\u2019s James\nWebb Space Telescope to\ndetermine whether the planets\nhave atmospheres and they\nhope to know whether there\nis life on the planets within the\nnext decade, when the next\ngeneration of telescopes will\nbe fully developed. Exciting\ntimes in the astronomical\nworld.\n\\\\ The hunt for alien\nlife beyond the\nsolar system could\nstart sooner than\nanticipated \\\\\nLizzie Riach discusses plans to create a full genetic map of all life on Earth\nNewdiscoveriesinspace\nSara Hamilton\nO\nn the 23rd\nof\nFebruary,\na small\ngroup of\nresearchers\nannounced\nthey wanted to sequence \u201call\nlife on Earth\u201d at a meeting\norganised by the Smithsonian\nInitiative of Biodiversity\nGenomics and China-based\nsequencing powerhouse\nBGI. The plan has been aptly\nnamed the Earth BioGenome\nProject (EBP), and would\nfirstly focus on sequencing\nthe DNA of the eukaryotes\n\u2013 the group of organisms\nthat includes plants, animals,\nfungi and single-celled\nmicroorganisms like amoebas.\nThe response to the plan\nwas well received, however\nthe financial cost will be\nseveral billion dollars, and\nso may take time to kick off.\nOliver Ryder, a conservation\nbiologist for the San Diego\nZoo Institute says \u201cThis is\na grand idea \u2013 if we really\nwant to understand how life\nevolved, genome biology will\nbe a part of that\u201d.\nSo why should all life be\nsequenced? The researchers involved drew several\nparallels between this and\nthe Human Genome project,\nwhich resulted in many new\nDNA technologies that form\nthe backbone of many new\nmedical treatments. Harry\nLewin, one of the EBP visionaries and an evolutionary\ngenomicist at the University\nof California points out\nthat \u201cpeople have learned\nfrom the human genome\nexperience that [sequencing]\nis a tremendous advance in\nbiology\u201d.\nDespite being a long way\noff a concrete plan, the\nestimated costs are already\nbeing worked out, with the\nentire eukaryotic sequence\ncosting around the same as it\ndid to sequence the very first\nhuman genome (according\nto Lewin). In today\u2019s money,\nthis is around $4.8 billion,\nand could take as little time\nas a decade according to the\norganisers.\nThis seems like a big job,\nbut a lot of headway has\nalready been made, with lots\nof smaller projects already\nhaving sequenced large\nnumbers of genomes. These\ninclude the Genome 10K\nProject, that aims to sequence\n10,000 vertebrate genomes\n(one from each genus);\ni5K, deciphering 5000\narthropods; and B10K, which\nis looking at 10,500 bird\nspecies genomes. EBP would\nsimply coordinate, compile\nand fund these various teams.\nThe biggest challenge may,\nhowever, be getting the DNA\nitself. Museum specimens,\nas well as recently collected\nfrozen samples may not\nyield enough, so many\nmay have to be retrieved\nfrom the wild. If completed,\nthis project could provide\nvaluable insights into our\nevolution and own genomic\nmake up. Lewin maintains\nthat this is the natural course\nof genomics, as sequencing\nimproves with time, saying \u201cIt\nbecame apparent to me that\nat a certain point, it would be\npossible to sequence all life\non Earth.\u201d\n\\\\ NASA\n\n"
