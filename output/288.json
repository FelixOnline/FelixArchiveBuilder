The working party set up\nat the last RCS Union\nMeeting to re-write the\nRCSU Constitution, has now\nvirtually completed its mammoth task, over a three\nhour coffee-drinking session.\nIt is hoped the new Constitution will be presented to\na Union meeting shortly.\nThe most important\nchanges proposed are to give\nthe Vice President something\nto do, to constitutional is e the\nRCS Broadsheet, the Entertainments Committee, and\nthe Academic Affairs Committee, and to cut down the\nnumber of Union meetings.\nIn the objects of the Union, the working party proposes that Carnival Charity\neffort should be added to the\nobjects, and that student\nwelfare be removed, as the\nlatter is now ably taken\ncare of by IC Union.\nThe basic reasons for these\nchanges are that the General\nCommittee has had great\ndifficulty in finding enough\nbusiness to do at the six sta-tut ary Union meetings each\nyear. Moreover, many members of the Gen. Comm. have\nbeen re-thinking the role of\nConstituent Colleges. In\nfuture, it is proposed that\nICU business will be strictly left to ICU so that RCSU\nwill not weaken or duplicate\nthe efforts of the Central\nUnion.\nTo further this aim, they\npropose to have only four ordinary Union meetings per\nsession. The first would be a Freshers' Meeting, arranged\nprimarily by Ents. In the\nspring term, there would be\na hustings meeting to present the aspiring candidates\nfor elections, followed by a meeting to announce and\nratify the results of these el-ect ions. The last meeting\nwould be the AGM. In ad-d it ion, an Extraordinary\nUnion Meeting could be called by 20 members. The\nquorum for all of these\nwould be kept at the nominal low figure of 50.\nOn the subject of elections, ballots would have to\nbe held throughout RCS for\nthe posts of President, Secretary, Chairman of Ents,\nAcademic Affairs Officer,\nand Charity Carnival Organiser. The latter person, would\nbe the former Vice President\nwho would be given an\nt. C.ENTS. PRESENTS Sat. 14rh Feb.\nMATTHEWS SOUTHERN COMFORT and SPICE\nAdmission 61-Sat. 21st Feb.\nFREE and Samson\nadmission 10/-actual job to do. Before, the\nonly official task of the VP\nwas to take over the chair\nin the absence of the President. Now, it is proposed, he\nwould chair a Carnival Committee of year Reps, so that\nhe could be in more direct\ntouch with Union members\nto persuade them to make\ngreater efforts to support\nCarnival collections, etc.\nThe RCS Broadsheet is\nnow in the Constitution. The\nEditor would, in the new\nproposals, be co-opted onto\nthe Executive Committee\n(a re-named version of the\nGeneral Committee). The\ncontent and format of the\nBroadsheet would be left to\nthe Editor, as yet nothing\nhas been decided about financial control.\nThe Ents Committee and\nAcademic Affairs Committee would both be put on a formal basis in the new pro-po sals.A list of functions\nto be organised by Ents is\nwritten in\u2014this includes a \"Smoking Concert\", but\nnothing is said about what\ngoes on at this function, so\nin theory (at least) we could\nbe seeing an H.G. Wells\ntype of Smoking Concert.\nThe Academic Affairs Officer is given a Committee of\nthe ICU Department Reps\nand members of the Departmental Sub-Committees.\nThe Acad. Off., who would\nbe Chairman, would also be\nthe RCSU Rep on Council,\nso could easily promote the\nviews of RCS students on\nthat body. The Departmental\nSub-Committees would deal\nmainly with academic mat-ter s, and they would be\nchaired by the IC Department Reps.\nAlso, the RCS Clubs and\nSocieties would come under\nthe control of a single Committee, the Clubs Comm.\nIn the Rules to be ob ser v at General Meetings, the\nworking party wants to\nacknowledge reality by\nscrubbing the clause which\nbans \"ammunition\" from the\nMeeting.\nA clause which could lead\nto abuse would be the proposal that Constitutional\nChanges need only be pos-sed by one meeting, instead\nof two as before.\nMost of the Officers of\nRCSU are confident that\nthe new Constitution would,\nif passed by the Union,\ngreatly improve the purpose\nand activities of RCSU, especially in view of the current re-thinking about the\nrole of Constituent Colleges\nin IC Union.\nDave\nWield\nresigns\nfrom\nI.C. Council\nGive Southside\na Chance\n\"The standard of cooking\nhas improved in the last\nfortnight, and must be\ngiven a chance.\" So said Mr.\nStephenson at \"Massive (in-quo rate) Mooney Meeting\"\nlast week.\nIn fact, the low attendance\ndrew the waspish comment\nfrom Mr. Stephenson that\n\"you arrange these things\nand the nobody comes\".\nMr. Stephenson, Mr. Levy,\nchairman and deputy chairman of the Refectory Committee, and Mr. Mooney\nanswered questions from the\nfloor\nMr. Mooney saw no\nnecessity for such extreme\nmeasures as a boycott but\nagreed that the standard of\ncuisine in Southside used\nto leave something to be de-sired.\nMr. Stephenson's opinion\nwas that, Southside except-ted, the refectories had improved greatly this year, the\nUnion especially. He too\nMessrs. Stephenson, Mooney and Levy at the Union Meeting.\nadmitted that Southside was\npoor but added that there\nare now two cooks in Southside whereas there used to be\nnone. The cooks were quite\nupset by the boycott and felt\nthey had not been given a chance to prove their worth,\none of them saying he did\nnot know if he was any use.\nOn the question of overcrowding in the student buttery in College Block, Mr.\nStephenson said that when\nCollege Block was in the design stage some years ago,\nthe equivalent of the but-te ry, the old \"c hippie\" in the\nUnion, was underused. Consequently only the present\ncramped quarters had been\nallocated in the design.\nI.C. ENTS. PRESENTS\nin concert in the\nGreat Hall College Block Tues. 24th Feb.

    "content": "Page 2 FELIX 12th February, 1970\nCARNIVAL CONCERT CHAPTER ONE At half-past eleven, Thursday 29th January, Carnival\nConcert No. 1 finished, after three hours of folk music\nperformed in three completely separate ways.\nIt was a success, both in making money for Carnival\nand in giving maximum enjoyment to almost a thousand\npeople who filled the great hall and gave enthusiastic support to the Gasworks, Bridget St. John, and Al Stewart.\nAn Al Stewart Admirer\nThe Gasworks were the ideal opening act with a come-on-why-don't you-all-join-in brand of folk; the introductions to\nthe songs were longer than the songs themselves, and just\nas funny. They finished their act with the saga of the finding\nof an ancient Roman stone tablet in a Wigan pit which\ndetailed the trials and frustrations of Mark Antony when his\nown shyness interacted with Cleopatra's lack of verbal en-courage ment. The chorus to the song was a whispered\n'Please verbalize your pre-orgasmic tensions . . .'\nFollowing the brashness of the Lancashire duo there\nwere the quiet, almost naive, songs of Bridget St. John. She\nwas dressed in a trailing black nia xi dress, and her long\ndark hair almost completely obscured her face. A single\nspotlight shone on her from each end of the stage, leaving\nthe rest of the stage and hall in darkness.\nHer songs, sung in her low, almost monotonous voice,\nhad a curious haunting quality: each song was vaguely\nreminiscent of the one before, but it was never boring. The\nlast song was the only song she didn't compose herself,\nLeonard Cohen's 'Suzanne', which was beautiful. The\naudience, which had been lively and noisy for the preceding\nact, was silent throughout every St. John song.\nDuring the interval, the audience evaporated towards the\nbar, where they congregated ten deep. The second half of\nthe concert was all Al Stewart, looking completely different\nfrom all the posters and photos I 've seen. His manner in\nintroducing his songs was casual but his singing and guitar\nplaying were not. Each song was accompanied by an anne c dote; one, 'Zero she flies', was preceded by a complete bizarre\nexplanation, which, I must admit, seemed to bear no relation\nto the song on first hearing.\nHis main piece was his own version of Dylan's 'It's alright, Ma, I'm only bleeding', which was also the longest\nsong. The last verse was separated from the rest by a period\nin which Stewart seemed to devote all his ability to a long\nguitar instrumental.\nHis act was fully balanced and not just a simple procession of songs; he recited one of his songs as a poem and\nfinished the hour with another poem, a much better one,\naccompanying himself solely on the bass string of his guitar.\n'If you've ever been to a pop concert', he said, 'you'll\nrealise this is the time in the evening for the drum solo'.\nHe turned his guitar over, played a simple rhythm on the\nback with the palms of his hands, turned it over again,\nfinished off the beat with his knuckles on the front of the\nresonance box and walked off.\n\u2022\nHe came back for a short encore, 12 seconds, then finally\ndisappeared, bringing to a close the first carnival concert.\nThe estimated profits were about \u00a3200, the cost for the\nartists being only \u00a3145 because they had all agreed to take\nreduced fees in view of the concert proceeds going to\ncharity. It was almost a sell out, only some of the 10/- tickets\nbeing left unsold. The concert itself was basically organised\nby Phil Taylor and Barry Pywell, who brought the Gasworks\nto the attention of the Carnival Committee. It looks likely\nthat there will be a second Carnival Concert, with ex-Fairport Convention lead singer Sandy Denny's new group\nas a possible attraction.\nIf it is as successful as the first there should be little\nworry about making any substantial loss which would spoil\nCarnival's steady success story.\n\u00bbmmm mmm mmm mmm The Gasworks\nAdventure Stimulus\n\"What we want is ad ven ture! \"\nThis was the remark made\nto a member of the Community Action Group while\nhe was visiting the St.\nAndrews Home and Club in\nVictoria. It could be argued\nthat the unsatisfied youth\nwas spoilt for choice.\nThe club concerned is\nhoused in a modern (1958)\nfive storey building and is\nwell equipped as Youth\nClubs go. There are three\ntable tennis tables, a very\nold and well preserved\nbilliards table, a woodwork\nroom where a qualified instructor teaches once a week,\na well stocked snack-bar, a lounge and a gymnasium\nwith good changing facilities.\nSpace is inevitably at a premium and the Club have\nbeen forbidden to build on\ntop of their gym; however\nthey have built a wire superstructure on the roof under\nwhich they can play football\nwithout blocking the fight to\nthe neighbouring buildings.\nThere is an interest in\ndrama and music and a very\nevident interest in art: members 'let loose' on a wall in\nthe snack-bar. Weekend activities, regrettably infrequent,\ninclude climbing and pony\ntrekking; they have built two\ncanoes, but lack the opportunity to use them.\nSo, to all outward appear-ances, a healthy and happy\nclub. However, Mr. Paul\nRead, the warden, is keen\nthat the club diversify its in-te rests, The members do become listless and there is\ntangible need for a new\nstimulus. This stimulus could\nwell be provided by Imperial\nCollege clubs and students.\nFor a successful interchange of ideas the involvement must be at a personal\nlevel to be effective. This immediately renders the relationship as much give as\ntake, and much more worth-while.\nNot so much 'adventure'\nmore 'stimulus'.\nIf you're at all interested\nin Youth, and willing to flex\nyour intuition, why not have\na go? There can be few more\npleasant and satisfying ways\nof spending an evening.\nINFO: The Club is mixed,\nages 11\u201421.\nAddress is 26 Gt. Peter\nSt.. S.W. K Guys to contact are J.K Lindsey, Chem Eng PG, or\nmyself Andrew.Dean, Chem\nEng 1.\nA A Meeting\nOnly about 20 people\ncame to the A A meeting/\nevent on Thursday evening\u2014\nAnonymously apathetic IC\nagain?\nThe A A people brought\nslides with them \u2014 a lot of\nAmerica, some of the architecture we all know and\nhate \u2014 high density office/\nflat blocks and towns fragmented by motorways, some\nsurrealist cottages, a few\n(half) nude women, and a sprinkling of Vietnam /\nBiafran gruesome s, just\nmade it clear that \"you are\nbeing educated, not enter-tai ned.\" In the discussion follow-ing, A A people said that\narchitectural teaching was\naimed at making inimical\nand boring jobs tolerable to\npeople obliged to do them\n\u2014 factory (and IC?) design,\nfor instance.\nThere is no \"alternative\narchitecture\" building beautiful cities for us \u2014 employed architects and town\nplanners are concerned with\nmaking an environment in\nwhich the individual is arranged for the convenience\nof the system. \"So you can\nsee what a load of shit architectural teaching is\". A dissident voice pointed out thai\neven in an ideal society,\nhouses would still need to.be\nbuilt, but the idea was hard\nto deny.\n\n"

The I.C. goals were scored by John\nSchofield and Julian Sargent.

Both sides\nstarted off enthusiastically,\nbut due to some d is organ is ation in the R.C.S. ranks\ntheir goalkeeper was soon\nbrought into action. Indeed,\nin making one save he was\ninjured when a Minesman\nmanaged to cut his hand\nopen with his studs. However, R.C.S. recovered from\nthis early setback and led\n1-0 at half-time thanks to a well taken goal from Richards, who beat the Mines'\ngoalkeeper, with a narrow-angled shot.\nThe second half was one\nof see-sawing fortunes,\nMines equal ising when Dixon scored from a disputed\npenalty. This was regarded\nas a harsh decision even by\nsome Mines players.\nAfter this, play swung\nfrom end to end until after\na succession of corners for\nR.C.S., Darley converted one\nwith a header from close\nrange. The Mines players\nwere not to be discouraged\nby this and being driven on\nby Dixon and Widelski they\ngot an equal ising goal about\nten minutes later, when by\na great stroke of luck a hopeful cross from the left\nwing managed to beat four\nR.C.S. defenders, leaving\nMoon with only the goalkeeper to beat from ten\nyards out. There was no further scoring from either\nside, and so with the match\nfinishing as a draw R.C.S. are faced with the task of\nbeating Guilds if they are to\nretain the trophy.\nGuilds2 Mines1 In the first game of the\nTech Cup this year, Guilds\nbeat Mines 2-1 in a fiercely\ncontested match. Guilds had\nthe stronger attack, but\nMines defended bravely and\nintelligently. Dixon was\neverywhere, breaking up\nGuilds' attack and starting\nswift Mines counter attacks.\nGuilds were the first to\nscore, when Willey, through\non his own, slid the ball past\nthe advancing goalkeeper. A good goal by the Mines outside right made the scores\nequal at half time.\nThe second half was\nscrappy with neither side\nable to produce any fluent,\ncoherent football. Mines\npresumably would have been\nsatisfied with a draw, but\nMcCardle made it 2-1 for\nGuilds 15 minutes from the\nend. Jumping with the goalkeeper he managed to force\nthe dropping ball into goal.\nMines tried to switch the\nemphasis of their game for\nthe last period, but now it\nwas Guilds turn to defend\nwhich they did successfully.\n\n"

As one grew older\nthese childhood ambitions\ndimmed until, in the majority\nof cases, the mind became\nperplexed by the increasing\nknowledge of the world and\nthe activities of other men\nand women.\nThe state of vagueness\ncan, and does last until the\nsecond, and even third year\nat a university. This fact is\nrecognised and Appointments Boards exist, not\nmerely to act as employment bureaux, but to advise,\nguide, and to help those\nstudents who wish to take\nadvantage of the facilities\navailable.\nAt Imperial College there\nis a member of the academic\nstaff in each department who\nis a member of the Sub Committee of the Appointments\nBoard. Any student, first,\nsecond or third year, or post-graduate, can consult this\ndepartmental representative\nwho will give as much\nadvice and assistance as\npossible, but before consulting him the students may\nwish to explore for themselves some of the fields\nwhich his or her studies are\nopening up for them.\nThere are several publications which can be of great\nhelp to a student who requires career information.\nAmong these, and perhaps\none of the best, is the\n\"Directory of Opportunities\nfor Graduates\" which is\npublished by Cornmarket\nCareers Centre Ltd. This\nbook gives information\nabout a large number of\nfirms and organisations who\nhave an interest in recruiting graduates, and reference\nto this book will answer a lot of those questions about\nthe firms which the student\nwill ask. Another publication on similar lines is the\nClassic Publications Ltd.\n\"Professional Careers for\nGraduate Scientists and\nEngineers\".\nThese books are excellent\nin giving students ideas and\ninformation concerning com-pani es, but they still do not\nsupply the whole answer to\nyour question \"What do I want to do?\"\nMost of the firms who\nemploy graduates issue\nliterature describing their\norganisations, and the\nvarious opportunities open\nto the graduates who join\nthe company. Naturally this\nis recruitment literature and\nbiased in the firms favour-\u2014\none would expect this, but\nthe literature provides part\nof the information necessary\nto help decide on the final\nline of action.\nOccasionally the course\nsuggested above does not\ngive the student the answer\nand after going through the\nbooks and brochures, and\ntaking his problems to the\ndepartmental representative\nthat perplexity still remains\nto some extent. There is yet\na further source of advice\nopen at the College.\nThe Imperial College\nAppointments Board has\nstrong links with the University of London Appointments Board and we have\ntaken advantage of a comprehensive Careers Advisory\nService which the University Board provides. The\nService is operated by Field\nOfficers who are graduates\nwith a wide range of experience and a thorough\nknowledge of most fields of\nemployment. A Field Officer\nvisits the College one day a week during term and vacations to help students make\ndecisions about careers and\nsubsequently to help put\nthem in touch with suitable\nemployers. Students who\nwish to see the Field Officer\nshould consult their departmental representative first.\nI have glibly talked of\nthe books and brochures but\nhave given no hint of how\nto gain access to them. That\nomission shall now be rec-tif i ed. In the near future, as\nsoon as certain structural\ndetails have received at ten tion, a Publications Library\nwill be opened on level 3,\nCollege Block, by the College\nAppointments Board. It is\nthe aim of the Board to\nmake available to die\nstudents all the literature\nsupplied by the companies\nand any other literature\nwhich has any connection\nwith careers. There will be\nno fanfare as the room is\nopened as it will be brought\ninto full operation as quickly\nas possible.\nSo far I have dealt with\nthe student who, having\ncompleted his course, selects\na career within his field of\nstudy, but what of the\nstudent who wishes to use\nhis degree in wider fields?\nA good guide here is a publication issued by the\nCareers Research and\nAdvisory Centre entitled\n\"Beyond a Degree\" which\ngives considerable help in\nsuggesting possibilities which\nprobably would not occur\nto the student in this pos i tion.\nTo such students my\nadvice is to consult the\nabove mentioned book,\nwhich is available on application to the Appointments\nBoard Office on Level 3,\nCollege Block then discuss\npossible plans with your\ndepartmental representative\nand, if he advises, the Field\nOfficer.\nAs there may be some\ndoubt in students minds as\nto the identity of their departmental representatives a full list is given below:\nMr. J.

    "content": "12th February, 1970 FELIX Page 5\nHow To Lose Money Without Really Dying\nIn this article, Insurance Broker Derek Cummings who js delivering next week's General studies lecture on\nthe subject of insurance, is questioned on the subject by Felix\nQ: The title of your lecture is \"How to lose money\nwithout really dying\"\u2014what\ndoes this mean?\nA: It means this. Insurance\ncompanies sell endowment\npolicies to the majority of\ntheir policyholders. These\npolicies very skilfully entangle the two factors concerning insurance \u2014 the protection factor and the savings\nfactor. And the point is that.\nWhen it comes to providing\nfor your dependants in the\nevent of your death, insurance companies are extremely good. But if you live\n\u2014 if your policy becomes an\ninvestment against later life\nor retirement \u2014 then they\nare diabolically un competitive. Q: You have gone on\nrecord as saying that all insurance companies are\nrogues\u2014why?\nA: In fact, you are referring to the title of my last\nlecture. I said it then and I will go on repeating it\nbecause insurance companies\nmislead the public into\nbelieving that ^endowment-type policies are the best\nthings for the public, when\nin fact they are merely the\nbest for the insurance com-pani es.Q: If this is true, why have\nthe companies been so successful in what you have\ncalled misleading the public?\nA: Because insurance is an\nemotional business. Everyone needs insurance. But the\ninsurance companies spend\nfortunes on advertising and\npromoting only those kinds\nof policies which are most\nprofitable to them.\nQ: You have said that\ntaking the investment factor,\ninsurance companies give the\npublic a bad deal. Why?\nA: Because the best of\nthem \u2014 the very best of\nthem \u2014 take eighteen years\nto double your money \u2014\nwhereas the economy has\ntaken only fifteen years to\nhalve the real value of your\nmoney. Obviously, the insurance companies are on\nthe best end of the deal by\nmiles.\nQ: How do you back up\nthis argument?\nA: I can back it with two\nreferences. According to\n\"The Economist\" of April\n26, 1969, the top six insurance companies will, on\naverage, take twenty years\nto double your money. On\nthe other hand, the Central\nStatistical Office of the\nTreasury, in a statistic dated\nSeptember 19, 1969, categorically states that the pound\nhas halved its real value in\nfifteen years.\nQ: Therefore it would\nseem that contemplating any\ntype of insurance is a waste\nof time and a potential\nwaste of money?\nA: As long as the individual has no financial\nresponsibilities, yes, I agree.\nBut it is my opinion that\nyoung people should not\nignore the value of saving\nvigorously towards an end,\nwhich is not necessarily re-tire ment, but which is going\nto have a far more important\nimmediate bearing on their\nlives. For example, house\npurchase. As for life assur-ance, it's fine \u2014 when there\nis a need for protection.\nQ: Assuming the need to\nlook to the future, what\nform should saving or investment take?\nA: Put your money into a building society. You are\ngoing to need a mortgage\nbefore you die! Look at it\nthis. way. Insurance companies take your valuable\npounds today and your\ngradually less valuable\npounds over a period of, say,\nfifteen years, and repay you\nwith inevitably devalued\npounds at the end of the\nperiod. On the other hand,\nwith house purchase you reverse this process. You borrow somebody else's valuable pounds today to\nbuy an appreciating com-modi ty, i.e.a house. At the\nsame time, you repay the\nvaluable pounds you have\nborrowed over a period,\nwith devaluing money. Further more, the appreciating\nvalue of the commodity you\nhave bought is more than\nenough to offset the interest\nyou have to pay on the\nborrowed money.\nQ: But there is the protection factor. I have my house,\nI want to protect my family.\nWhat advice would you give\nwith regard to that?\nA: Spend as little as\npossible to achieve the\nmaximum amount of cover.\nIt can be done cheaply. I know it can. Every insurance company in the land\nknows it can, but there is a world of difference between\ntheir knowing it and telling\nyou about it. Why should\nthey? They're on too good\na thing with the traditional\nold endowment policy. No,\nthey won't tell you and\nneither, by the way, will\nmost brokers.\nQ: It seems you are condemning your own pro-fess ion.A: Right, I am. Insurance\ncompanies, I accept. will be\nbiased. Insurance Brokers,\non the other hand, are meant\nto be unbiased, but I have\nyet to meet any that are.\nQ: Why do you say that?\nA: Because it is true. It is\nin the interest of brokers to\nsell you the same policies as\nthe insurance companies\nwant you to buy, because\ntheir commission is a percentage of the premium you\npay. The more you pay, the\nmore they get. Is a broker\ngoing to tell you to buy a policy with a cheaper pre-miu m? No, of course not.\nAnd that is really back to\nthe beginning. You are being\nmisled.\nQ: Your previous answers\nappear to be a strong condemnation of insurance com-pani es. How do you justify\nbeing in the profession?\nA: I think this is a good\nquestion. There is, of course,\na great deal more to it than\nthe foregoing as you must\nrealise. I am hoping that\nwhat I have said will cause\nthe student to scratch his\nhead rather more vigorously\nbefore he leaps out to buy\ninsurance hand over fist. I can, of course, answer any\nquestions at the General\nStudies lectures on the 17th and 24th February.\nThis could make all the difference\nto your next twenty years\n( or your starter for five)\n\u2022 In a few months you'll have a degree.\n\u2022 You won't be ostentatious about it. Just so long as\npeople know.\n\u2022 What matters is putting all that knowledge to\npractical use.\n\u2022 If each day doesn't bring new problems you won't be interested.\n\u2022 The trouble with industry is that it's still too slow\nexploiting innovation.\n\u2022 Yes-men go far. The further the better.\n\u2022 Money matters. But what about intangibles - like keeping\nyour identity, not getting swallowed up?\n\u2022 People matter. Especially those who will be working\nwith you - and those who will work for you.\n\u2022 Having got this far you owe it to yourself to see the\nBICC careers people.\nThey're here on February 26/27.\nYour future's in the balance - or at least the\nnext five years are.\nYour Appointments Officer will have details.\nget there - with BICC Central Personnel Relations Dept.,\nPrescot, Lanes., L34 5W J.

Swinyard (Cyril\nLuckham) knowing he has\nonly a short time to live, resolves to find out how his\nfamily will treat him when\nthey find out he could die\nat any moment. His son-in-law Zoltan (Clement McCallin), a brilliant scientist\noffers him in return for his\nmoney to freeze his body\nuntil such a time, when it\nmight be possible to reverse\nthe effects of old age. The\nold man tells him that he\nthinks he is mad and hints\nthat he is going to give all\nhis money to his granddaughter Jetta, who is the\nonly one in his family with\nany hope left, the others\nhaving denied the faith\nyears ago. This makes his\ndaughter uptight about the\nwhole thing and when Jetta\nannounces that she's pre g nant, the whole conflict\nemerges. Jetta can find no\nsympathy from anyone and\nnot wanting to shock her\ngrandfather to death, decides\nto commit suicide. This\nbrings everyone else to their\nsenses and Zoltan is con-verte d. Hurrah! Hurrah!\nI think an interesting idea\nhas been ruined by the\noversimplification of treat-ment. I thought most of the\nperformances were un-convincing, but did like\nthat newcomer Yvonne Antrobus (right) as Jetta.\nThe contrasts between good\nand evil were made somewhat too obvious and therefore seemed unreal, especially\nthe actions of Zoltan after\nfinding his daughter dead.\nHowever the message will\nprobably get through to the\nconverted, and any rate it's quite good for a low budget\nfilm.\nZ is still on at the Curzon\ncinema and still pulling in\nlarge audiences, which isn't really surprising since it\nwas probably the best film\nof last year. It tells the\nfascinating story of a political assassination (in an\nunidentified Mediterranean\ncountry)( could it be\nGreece?) and how a determined young examining\nmagistrate (Jean Louis\nTrintignant) grimly digs out,\nfrom a succession of scared\nwitnesses, evidence of police\ncorruption. The makers of\nthe film say that it is a true\naccount of Greece before the\ngenerals took over. The film\nis striking and extremely\nmoving. Trintignant and\nYves Montand as the politician give superb performances which bring home the\npoignancy of the dile ma. Also worth seeing: Last\nSummer: about two boys\nHurrah for the Bridge\"\nThis was originally entered for the U.L. U. one act play\non the grounds that it consisted of a load of metaphysical\nrubbish laced with some tidy chunks of violence. The plot\nin general consists of an old man wheeling the corpse, or\nsoul, of a dead prostitute to an indefinite destination by\nthe river. En route he is set upon, mocked, tortured and\nfinally knifed by a gang of ted s, who throughout the proceedings dispose of two of their number into the said river. This\nlooks and sounds like a load of old cock!\nFurther inspection, however, revealed that the play should\nbe taken more seriously. The character of the old man is so\nsubtle and demanding and the imagery so vast and confused\nthat it tied the whole bloody cast up in knots and the only\nthing left seems to be to play the old sod as a loon\u2014which\nwould explain a lot of things\u2014such as the dialogue !\nThe characters of the four yo bs have likewise grown\ncomplex to the point of imbecility. The main conflicts appear\nto he not with the old man but in the interplay of characters\nwithin the wolfpack which eventually results in the death of\nthe two weakest. Since these parts of the play consist of\n(sic) improvisations, constant group therapy exercises to\n'establish confidence and familiarity' have driven everyone\nto the desired state of paranoia (and the damn thing goes on\nto Thursday).\nAs a final point, if this thing does make it\u2014it could easily\nbe the best and most exciting production Dramsoc has ever\nspawned.\nCHANGING BOOMS?\nSend your old address or\ncomments via the internal\nmessengers to the Lodgings\nBureau, 8 Princes' Gardens.\nOVERLAND INDIA\nRegular departures\nDELHI \u00a385\nAUSTRALIA from \u00a3190\nOverland Trips,\n39 Lansdowne Gardens,\nLondon, S.W.8 Tel. 01-622 2502 evenings\nSHARE/WANT\u2014A \u2014FLAT?\nCome and put your name\non the WLSAB Plat Register at the Lodgings\nBureau, 8 Princes' Gardens\nJoin the travelling people\nGO FREEWHEELING\nOverland safaris by 15 seater\nMinitruck to:\nIstanbul, Greece and the islands,\nMoroco, Spain. 2 & 3 week\ntrips from \u00a335.\nBrochure from:\nFREEWHEELING LTD.,\nDept. 30, 28 Fan-holme Road,\nLondon.

As\nyou know, the negotiations\nbroke down because the college took an inflexible and\nilliberal attitude to the A A's participatory academic community\u2014as it says in the\nUGC pamphlet: \"the college\nis confirmed that\u2014(for the\nA A school at IC) . . . student participation should follow the general pattern for\nthe college as a whole.\"\nThe potential academic\ngain (of Prof. Buchanan,\nGuardian) and the views of\nICU were ignored; the college seems to take the attitude that academic fred om is freedom to conform\u2014or\nelse! So we hold a moratorium. The week before last when\nthe ICRC (students and tech-nic ian s/, etc.) discussed the\nrefectory situation. They decided to seek an urgent meeting with the rector\u2014of a delegation representing every\nsection of the college com-m unity. The rector refused, writing\nback that the ICRC \"has no\nconstitutional position in\nIC\". So what! If representatives of the vast majority of\nthe college want to organise\nthemselves to discuss things\nof mutual interest with the\nhead of the college why\nshouldn't they? Anyhow, despite this, at the food forum\nU GM, the Union produced a set of minimal requests,\nwhich the college's refectory\ncommittee should have produced ages ago. If a favourable decision is not forth-coming, by the U GM on\nFeb. 19th, direct action will\ncertainly be considered.\nThe senior common room\ncommittee, after discussion\nwith the rector, organised a referendum about our re-quests, but they did not present the Union case to members of the SCR and only\nasked one emotive YES/ NO question. The result was, of\ncourse, no. But anyway, what\nabout such propositions as:\n\"make PGs members of the\nSCR\" or \"make College\nBlock a free precinct\".\nAll these things show that\nImperial College seems to be\narrogant and inflexible, incapable of understanding\nother ideas or recognising\nthe validity of different concepts of academic organ is a tion.\nPedestrian discussion is\noccurring on diversification\n\u2014but the Open Forum on\nthe subject has not yet been\nheld\u2014because too much controversy was expected!\nWe are waiting for a decision on representation from\nthe BOST on February 18th to be reported to the Feb.\n19thUG M.

A.\" Conditions do not exist for a merger\" After eight years of negotiations towards the merger\nof the Architectural Association with Imperial College, the Governors of I.C. called off the talks last week.\nLord Penney, writing to\nJohn Dennys, the acting\nPresident of the Architectural\nAssociation said that \"the\nAssociation has raised fundamental issues, and events\nhave taken place in the\ncourse of the negotiations\nwhich have finally caused my\ncolleagues and I to realise\nthat the requisites for as uc successful merger do not\nexist'.\nThe decision to call off the\nnegotiations left the Architectural Association stunned\nand many students at I.C. and the A.

A., that the\n\"A. A. did not agree that a basis for a merger no longer\nexisted\". This comment came\nat the end of a chilly letter\nto Lord Penney in which Mr.\nDennys expressed amazement that \"such a distinguished body should have\nbehaved so irresponsibly\".\nNo members of the Association were present at the\nGovernors meeting which decided to drop the A. A., even\nthough three Imperial College students were there. Indeed, the I.C. governors had\npermitted working party\nmeetings and discussions\nright up to this particular\nmeeting and had even arranged future dates. This the\nA. A. found \"hard to believe,\nwithout giving us some clear\nindication of what was in\nyour (Lord Penney's) mind.\"\nFund raising\nThe move was taken at a time when the President of\nthe Association, Miss Jane\nDrew, was in the U.S.A. trying to raise money for the\nnew buildings needed by the\nA.

A. was running a competition for these new build-in gs, and had only just committed themselves to several\nthousand pounds additional\nexpenditure in announcing\nthe second stage of the com-petition.\nMoreover, the A. A. felt\nthat the Governors' decision,\nand their letter, lid not \"ex-press one word of regret for,\nnor shown any understanding\nof, the possible results on\ntheir action in setting at hazard the education and future\ncareers of the students and\nstaff of the school.\"\nCOCKROACH APOLOGY A number of readers have\nsaid that they thought that\nthe pictures of cockroaches\nin the last issue of FELIX\nwere not genuine.

Letters to the Editor\nPiers Disgruntled Dear U.C., A few people have asked\nme 'How was the timing of\nthe refectory boycott on\nTuesday 20 January decided\non?'. The answer is, frankly,\nquite unimportant but since\n' FELIX' is interested I will\nexplain. Following the boycott decision of the 15 January U. G.M., the special\nI.C.U. Council meeting (of\nMonday 19 January) decided\nthat: (i)I \u2014in consultation\nwith John Goodman and\nother pickets\u2014would decide\nat 11.30 on each day, on\nwhich there could possibly be\na boycott, whether or not to\nboycott on that day. (ii)\nPickets were to come to the\nUnion Office at 11.30 every\nsuch day, beginning with\nTuesday. The decision was\nto be taken in this way to\nensure that the boycott was\na surprise. Anybody who attended the special Council\nMental Blockages\nDear Sir,\nIt is becoming apparent that in its efforts to remain independent of all pressure -groups\nin the Union, FELIX is become a private arena for political abuse of left by right and\nvice versa. While not deprecating this useful function, it deserves to be kept within bounds.\nI suggest therefore, that extremists be severely limited to two pages, and that these are\nprinted on opposite sides of the same single sheet, and prominently labelled. The large\nnumbers of people who are uninspired and bored by the regular evidence of the mental\nblockages of Muller, Lafferty, X, Robinson, et al, may then, instead of having to skirt\ntheir illogical rubbish, remove it neatly and discard it before reading the paper.\nIt may be objected that this will cost money : this could well be covered by appropriate\ncontributions (on the advertising scale) from the above mentioned persons, as they obviously consider their views worthy of the at tent ion of the masses.\nAn alternative would be to add two subroutines to the 7094 library : ' LEFT' and\n'RIGHT'. Anyone addicted to the regular reassurance of views he agrees with has only to\ninclude these in a programme to receive two pages of random prose in the relevant style,\ntotally indistinguishable from the originals.\nYours sincerely,\nP. LEE,P3\nmeeting (unlike FELIX) would know this. On Tuesday at 11.30 I was phoned\nup (in my Southside room) by\nJohn Butterworth who was\nin the Union Office with\nsome other pickets. After a discussion we agreed ona boycott that day, John Goodman\nshould have been there and\nwasn't \u2014but he doesn't mind!\nA larger number of people,\nthan Who have asked me\nabout the boycott timing,\nhave asked me about the following (for instance): What\ncan we do about possible\neducation cuts? What does\nthe Rector think about the\nA A? What shall we do if the\nBOST say 'no' again? What\ndid Gerry Fowler (of DES)\nsay to me? What (in sum-mary) are the recommendations of the Quinquenium\nWorking Party? I think the\nanswers to these questions\nare important but will not\nattempt to give them here\n'because of space reasons'.\nYours, etc.,\nPIERS CORBYN\n(I.C.U. President)\nThird World\nDear Sir,\nAs I watch with interest\nthe growing concern at Imperial College over the eco-no mic, social and political\nstruggle in the Third World,\nand at the same time notice\nthe vast human resources, at\nthe College, of students in\nscience and technology, including a large proportion of\nstudents from the Third\nWorld, may I make use of\nthe pages of your newspaper\nto stir up interest in the for-mati on, at the College, of\nstudy groups in Third World\ntechnology policies and technical requirements.\nWe have heard of the\n'Science of Science' study\ngroups involved in the scientific investigation of the in-flu en ce, effect and correct\napplication of science poli-cie s. As regards developing\nsocieties, these investigations\nare very urgently needed for\nobvious reasons. Here the\ngreatest interest lies both\nwith science policies and with\ntechnology policies. What is\nmore, some very hard and\nbasic work must be done,\nsince what is applicable to\nBritain and other advanced\nsocieties will not necessarily\nwork well with other types\nof societies.\nImperial College prides itself in its contribution to the\ntechnological education in\ndeveloping countries, its exchange with the Indian Institute of Technology at Delhi\nbeing one of the most quoted\nexamples. It has also a high\nproportion of students from\nthese countries, especially research students. Nevertheless\nit cannot help in the fact\nthat its curricula, its subjects\nof study, syllabuses and research interests of its staff\nare almost wholly geared to\nthe requirements of highly\nindustrialised and technologically advanced countries like\nBritain. Those who claim\nthat one science and engineering syllabus meets the requirements of every society\nare surely trying to mislead.\nIt is only through study, investigation and learning from\nothers that the College can\nAnagrams and\nHot Air\nDear Sir,\nI was more than a little\nsurprised when 1 read Mr. Hains' letter in your last\nissue, in which he positively\naffirms that his latest open\nletter on diversification is\nvitally important and much\nmore deserving of type-find out how to meet the requirements of developing\ncountries, since there is little\nexperience at present to go\nby. It is the students from\nthese developing countries\nwho have to find out and\nlook after their own interest,\nand initially they have to do\nit themselves. The College's Board of Studies should\nmake its own contribution to\nthis, in forming and financing\na unit for such studies, perhaps to ease the guilty conscience felt after the govern-ment's advice on increased\nfees for overseas students.\nYours faithfully,\nJOHN CHEUNG,\nThe letter has been condensed\u2014Editor.\nspace than other articles of a more diverse nature. If we\nmust accept that a student\nnewspaper only exists for\nmembers of staff to read, it\nis difficult to see how yet another open letter on diversification can forward its\ncause.\nI had always imagined, obviously mistakenly that FELIX was produced for the students of I.C. whose discerning minds could see that\n'open letters on divers if ica tion' were a form of anagram\nwhere the sentiments could\nbe shuffled and reshuffled\nand presented as original\nissue after issue. As I now\nknow, FELIX is produced\nsolely for the benefit of staff\nand council, who 'apparently'\nare not so discerning about\nwhat they read. I will not\nfritter sixpences on FELL X any more as it is obviously\nnot intended for a mere student who expects more than\nhot air from a newspaper.\nYours faithfully,\nJUSTIN G.

Is\nit because they do not see these problems on their own doorstep and cannot associate themselves with any event not\nhaving a direct bearing on their lives, or is it because they\nare just unconcerned with the problems of people in the\nthird world?\nThis third world has problems, many of which have\nbeen encountered before by the western civilization, but\nwhat really makes these problems intolerable is not only\nthe suffering they produce but the fact that the western\nworld has the power to conquer poverty, disease and human\nmisery, and yet does so little about it, except for aggravating\nthe problems of exploitation. It may relieve our consciences\nto talk of these problems, philo soph is e about them and expound theories of solution, but does this have any effect\nupon the lives of the people in those countries which are\npolitely referred to as \"underdeveloped\".\nEXISTING ORDER\nThe Third World Society has just been formed in I.C., and our aim is to promote the cause of the third world by\nmeans of study groups, political action, meetings and fund-raising, and of course any other means possible.

This is not as\nnoticeable on this record as many others, and\nLittle Free Rock tend to act as more of a unit than in Ten Years After, where Alvin\nLee takes the fore, or in Led Zepplin where\nJimmy Page does likewise.\nComprising two guitarists and a drummer,\neach also being credited with an assortment\nof other instruments, they perform nine num-be rs, of which \"Making Time\" seems to be the\nonly futile one.\nMyself, I liked \"Age of Chivalry\", \"Blud\"\nand \"Tingle\", the last of which seems to send\nitself up one's spine.\nI'm not sure what the future holds for rock,\nbut this group is one that shouldn't find any\ndifficulty in expanding their field to become\naccomplished musicians.\nSpooky Tooth/Piere Henry\n\"Ceremony\"\nILPS 9107\nI 'll say from the start that this is not an\nalbum for those who like pleasant tunes that\ncan be hummed at any time.\nHowever the record does achieve its objective, and I feel this is because of the prominent\ninfluence of Pierre Henry. His electronic score\ngives wailing voices on \"Have Mercy\" and\na nail being driven into a person's head on\n\"Confession\" makes one cringe with every\nthud. Even Spooky Tooth's guitars and organ\nsound tame compared to this, and yet the\nrecord keep an atmosphere of reverence,\nalthough it is Spanish Inquisition style. It's best\nlistened to in total darkness and then conjures\nup pictures like on the sleeve.\nThe distortions produced on the vocals\nreally do sound like a person in agony and\nif this is an experimental album, then I can't wait to hear what the next one's like.\nJe i hro The new single from\nJethro Tull is more of a double as both sides are\ngiven equal preference.\n\"Witch's Promise\" and\n\"Teacher\" are the two sides\nand show the polished performance that the group has\nnow achieved, ridiculing the\n\"commercialised\" tag that\nhas been hung on them by\ncertain members of the\npublic.\nBlodwyn Pig's new single\n\"Same old Story\" however\nis rather dull and I'm sure\nthat better could be done.\nA good memento of the\nYoung Tradition that used\nto be is \"The Young Tradition Sampler\" on Transatlantic. This includes all tracks\nfrom their E.P. \"Chicken on\na Raft\" and a good assortment of tracks from their\nthree LPs, including \"Lyke\nWake Dirge\", \"Byker Hill\"\nand \"Daddy Fox\".\nAnyone who remembers\nas far back as the days of\nLittle Richard's hits (and I don't) will be gratified to\nhear that all his original recordings have been released\non the first of a series of\nLPs devoted to rock and roll\nstars. Tracks include\n\"Lucille\", \"Good Golly Miss\nMolly\" and \"Tutti Frutti\". Tull\nThe Owls and the Catty-Puss\nThe multitude of duplicated news-sheets, I.C.'s answer\nto information diarrhoea, and recent Council motions about\nFELIX have served to focus attention once again on the\nrole of an independent newspaper in the college.\nThe debate is sharpened by the wider national discussion\non the freedom of the press started by various moves in\nParliament to protect individual privacy. As a former FELIX Editor and a floor rep. on Council I have more than a passing interest in the debate at least in college.\nThe first question that must be faced concerns the role\nof FELIX. The blizzard of bump h sheets, usually written by\ndisjointed Daleks, has brought a crisis of identity to FELIX. It is impossible for a newspaper printed in remotest Dursley\nto compete with a sheet of foolscap, produced at the drop\nof a stencil, in speed of news-presentation.\nBOG PAPER? Those who see speed as the vital criterion have therefore\nquestioned the present high FELIX grant of \u00a3800 and suggested it be used to provide even more free bog paper or\nat least used to defray the costs of this public-spirited pra c tice. Indeed if speed was the only criterion they would be\nquite correct. However the question is rather more complex,\n1 believe both the efficiency of communication is served by\na well-produced, informed and independent newspaper and\nthat such a newspaper is vital to the ethos of a college which\nmust ever fight to maintain a little of the academic atmosphere. VIRILITY It has been said that the standard of living of a family\nvaries proportionately to the thickness of the note-paper\nand inversely as the thickness of the bog-paper. There is\nsomething too about the standard of a College which can\nbe told by the virility of its newspaper. I make no pretence\nto be the kind of journalist with whom it is a pleasure to\ntravel on the tube, but I do take pride that every year or so\nFELIX does discover a little latent literary talent. Even more\nimportantly too, I delight to see the growth in critical\nawareness of many as the impish little cat continues its\ncrusade of independence.\nDEFLATING There is nothing more salutary than when, with a snatch\nof its paws, FELIX deflates the ego of some swelling Union\nofficial, or tears away the drape of grandeur with which\nCouncil delights to cloak its parochial schemes. If independence does nothing more than to put us Union types where\nwe belong, in the servants' quarters rather than the throne\nroom, and to underscore for us all the basic human failing\nof pride in supposed self-achievement, it is value for money.\nIn a university, however, independence means much more\nthan this; it is part of the whole critical character.\nAs we frequently tell the Rector, IC must develop critical\nminds because in the big world there is nobody to set the\ncourses or spoon-feed the teaching; only a critically minded\nperson can educate himself. True, FELIX makes mistakes,\nbut this too is part of the process, to better the independence\nof the paper, for this would be a direct parallel to the Board\nof Studies' actions, or to those forces in society which de-human is e people.\nHOUSE JOURNALS Suggestion was made in an article I wrote for the Union\nhandbook this year that the constituent college news-sheets\nwould not gain sufficient independence from their Union\nbosses to be other than house-journals. Sorry to say, not\nonly has this prediction been borne out, but their very speed\nand manner of production has made them even more sec-t arian, and less independent, Searching comment cannot\neasily be made on news an hour or so old, and certainly not\nby a party intimately involved. Indeed, in the poorest of\nthese news-sheets, the comment and news presentation has\nbecome so pettily sectarian that it is they, and not FELIX, that represents poor value for money.\nReproduced below are extracts from a letter by Piers\nCorbyn to last year's Publications Board. Piers, then a floor\nrep of Council, spearheaded the successful FELIX counterattack against certain members of Council who wanted\nto gh ter control over editorial policies.\nA number of people have recently been complaining\nabout FELIX . . , The people who are grumbling, it ap-pears, are almost wholly establishment figures, largely from\nthe Union, who are concerned about their images.\nI believe that the policies of such a newspaper should\nnot be largely dictated by the body which \"holds the purse\nstrings\" (i.e. Council).\nExec and Council . . i. may be prone to suppress opinion\nin an attempt to use FELIX to boost their own images and\nbolster their own ego-trips. Attempts have been made in\nthe past...... to do this and perhaps some may wish to try\nagain. We must not let the powers of money and ego become unleashed in such dangerous forms.\nThe concentrated financial power over the purse strings\nmust largely be separated from the power over expenditure\n. . . . The function of the Publications Board is, therefore,\nto safe-guard the interests of the \"citizens\", by separating the\nfinancial control from that over policies.\nWIDER SCOPE? A final word about a relatively new and fashionable suggestion that since we are trying to build a single college\ncommunity we should turn FELIX into an organ of this\ncommunity. While it is right FELIX must for the sake of\nits very in dependency accept articles from all sections of the\nacademic community and from all views in it, especially\nthose which conflict with its editorial policy; is this idea\ncorrectly reasoned?\nAlthough many interests of the college community are\nsimilar, other interests are different and still others conflict.\nFoY instance are the staff vitally interested in hopes, or\ntechnicians in graduate recruitment. Could it not be that\nthe hand requires a glove, while the foot a shoe. Surely one\nof the purposes of our present Union policy is not to show\nwe are all hands or feet, but rather that hands and feet are\nessential different, interdependent parts of one body. Let\nthe wise owls of Council have the sense to give the catty-puss\nFELIX the freedom to show just that.\nLes Eb don "
