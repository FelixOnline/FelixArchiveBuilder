    "content": "NIGHTLIFE FELIX I Editorial\nFriday @ Felix Nightlife\nWell people, we've come to that time of year\nwhen all serious c lubbers are (or should be)\nstarting to think about what to do for New\nYears Eve. While some people object to the\ncommercial is ation and larger cost of NYE we\npersonally think that the increased party\natmosphere and general sense of euphoria is\nworth the money. New Year parties are normally quite large, and we like it large.\nHowever, if you disagree but still want a decent New Year why not skip NYE and go for\na party on New Years Day, several of the big\nclubs are doing daytime parties on NYD for the\ncost of a normal night and they promise to be\njust as good as anything else going on in the\ncapital. So why not give yourself a change,\nsave some money and delay the inevitable\nhangover for an extra day.\nFor those who can't wait for that morning\nafter feeling and want to do a traditional NYE\nthere's always a massive choice across the\nentire spectrum of genres. We've included\nsome of the ones we think will be best in this\nmonths Top 10, a new feature whereby each\nmonth we'll point out what we think will be the\nbest 10 nights of the coming month, keep an\neye on it and use it as your guide.\nWe would also like to take this opportunity\nto make another plea for reviews. If any of you\nhave been somewhere recently that's blown\nyou away, send in a review and we'll stick it in.\nWe would especially like to hear from anybody\nwho went up to the NEC for Gatecrashers' big\nend of summer party recently.

This room kept it hard all\nnight long letting others cater for the lighter\ntastes.\nBar De Lune were the genuine surprise but\nParks and Wilson were the highlight. They\ndelivered in style with a more haunting set\nthan you'd have expected from their Essential\nMix. But if all the dancing and sweaty bodies\nget a bit much you can always go and cool off\nin the open air terrace before you hit the floor\nagain. Ultimately, the Bar boys made the entry\nprice worth it, with P and W the icing on the\ncake.\nWhen they're back next month, try out the\nBar first of all, as long as you want your house\nhard and unrelenting.\nKenneth Henry + Peter Taylor\nSaturday 7th December\nAnthony Pappa, Ian Ossia 6hr b2 b10pm6 am \u00a315\nThe Cross,27-31 York Way, Nl\nwww.the-cross.co.uk\nH UPLIFTING EUPHORIA ROOM >\n\u2022eve Pearce, John Fleming, The Mar]\n1\n^ EXTREME EUPHORIA ROOM > \\\nLisa Lashes, Tidy Boys, Dean Peters\nBEST OF EUPHORIA ROOM >\nThe Man Adam, Anthony Dean, Simon W!*?

    "content": "MUSIC REVIEWS FELIX Live Re\" w \u2014 ~ *\nThe Vines\nShepherd's Bush Empire, November 2nd3/5 It's Sunday night, the place is\npacked and I'm feeling a little old.\nIt seems the majority of The\nVines' fans really shouldn't be out\nthis late, especially before a school night. Which is a shame -the band's appeal shouldn't be\nlimited to angst-ridden teenagers.\nWhen they get it right, The Vines\nare a great live act. But before\ngetting to them, there's the small\nmatter of two support acts...\nFirst are The Bandits; six\nScousers doing a passable\nimpression of The Coral, blended\nwith the Mersey beat pop of The\nLa's. The Bandits run a club night\nthat showcases upcoming local\ntalent. Appropriately called the\nBandwagon, it typifies the glut of\nsound-alike bands in Liverpool at\nthe moment, and The Bandits are\nno exception. Tonight they fail to\ninspire, lacking the originality of\ntheir psychedelic com padres. Next up: the riff-driven indie\nrock of Nada Surf, New York veterans plugging their latest album\nLet Go. No strangers to the live\nscene, the band play with confidence, combining upbeat progressive rock with disquieting lyrics\nabout isolation, fear and loss.\nWith hints of New Order and\nFlaming Lips, the new material\nsounds edgier live and contrasts\nnicely with the anticipated riot of\nthe Aussie boys' main set.\nFormed through a mutual\nhatred of working at McDonalds,\nThe Vines spent their first gigs\ndoing Nirvana covers at wedding\nreceptions, and these early influences provide the essence of their\ngarage rock.\nKicking off their set with killer\nfirst single 'Highly Evolved', a90 second rush of mammoth riffs\nand shredded vocal chords, Craig\nNicholls' stage presence is predictably manic. Meanwhile,\nbassist Patrick Matthews and\ndrummer Dave Olliffe are resolutely deadpan.\nWith little banter between\nsongs, The Vines are happy to let\nthe music do the talking, rattling\nthrough crowd-please rs 'Outtathaway' and 'Get Free' with\ncavalier cool, whilst their cover of\nOutkast's 'Miss Jackson' is hauntingly melancholic; an upbeat rap-per's brag transformed into a desperate plea for forgiveness.\nThe rest of the set is devoted to\nthe band's quieter side, with the\nepic sounds of 'Autumn Shade'\nand 'Mary Jane' filling the venue\nwith soaring guitars and ethereal\nvocals. It is with these songs,\nhowever, that the band's performance falters.\nShameless use of the re verb pedal and tedious Floyd-esque\nsolos cause even the die-hard\nteenagers to become restless.\nThey want noise. Big dirty slabs\nof it.\nJudging by the quantity of\ndrinks being thrown at the stage,\nThe Vines oblige not a moment\ntoo soon, returning to form with a frenzied encore of the instantly\nlikeable 'Ain't No Room', which\nbrings about a state of euphoria\namongst the acne'd masses. And\nme too, for it's at their most outrageous that The Vines' live performance excels.\nTom Bell\nJesse Malin+Ryan Adams\nRoyal Festival Hall, 11th November\n4 / 5\nTonight the audience at the Royal\nFestival Hall of London is quite\nunusual. Not known to embrace\nthe populist, the Hungerford\nBridge Hall is full with people\nwearing jeans and T shirts. This\nMonday, pop replaces classical in\nthe 'Royal' venue of South Bank.\nRyan Adams is the producer of\nhis debut album 'The Fine Art of\nSelf Destruction', Ryan Adams\nplays the guitar on this album, so\nit was obvious that Jesse Malin\nwould support Ryan Adams on his\nsolo tour throughout Europe.\nAlone on stage with only an\nacoustic guitar, Jesse Malin begins\nhis show in front of an audience\nwho doesn't know this young guy\nfrom New York.\nThe first thing that I feel, is the\nsimilarity between Jesse Malin\nand Ryan Adams: he plays beautiful pop songs telling stories about\nlife in NY.\nNot used to playing in this kind\nof venue, he is not afraid at all:\ntalking with the audience, presenting the next songs, Jesse\nMalin impresses by his audacity. I didn't know him a lot, just reading\ngood review of his album in Uncut\nMagazine (new album of the\nmonth in November but I rarely\nfeel such emotions for a first part\nof a concert. Usually, you just go\nto the bar for a beer, talk with your\nfriend waiting for the main band.\nBut the venue was quiet, listening\nto Jesse Malin as he was the main\nperformer. If you like songwriters,\nyou have to see him in December\nat the Spitz, you won't regret it!\nAfter this, Ryan Adams made a huge performance with an about\ntwo-hour set: no band, just him\non stage and his songs. If someone doubted about the talent of\nRyan Adams \"one of the most\nrevered songwriter-performers of\nhis generation\", he proved at the\nLondon gig the contrary. He performs songs of his albums 'Gold'\nand 'Demolition'. Forgetting the\noverproduced album versions, he\nenjoys the audience of SE1 with\npure emotive songs.\nA fan of both Oasis and The\nRolling Stones, he gives his own\nversions of 'Wonderwall' and\n'Brown Sugar'.\nIn conclusion, a very good con-cert, which was not unexpected\nbecause of the singers, and the\nclassical atmosphere in the venue.\nMike\n3CR It's Feet First at Camden Palace\nand the teeny-bopper s are out\nin their hordes. As the clock\nstrikes twelve, 3 Colours Red\nstep on stage to rock the Palace\nto the ground.\nThey are the band once labelled\n\"hotter than Oasis\" - responsible for such hits as 'Beautiful\nDay' and 'Sixty Mile Smile'.\n3CR retreated from the world of\nrock in 1999 due to the usual\n\"musical differences,\" but today\nthey're back with a vengeance.\nCurrently talking to several\nlabels about their future and\nabout to begin a European tour\nin December, guitarist Pete\nVuckovic seems rather enthusiastic about their next step for-ward. \"The new stuff's completely different but there's still some of the old influences\nin there - people seem to enjoy\nit.\"\nThe youthful crowd at the\nPalace seem to agree as the\nmoshi ng heads and sporadic\ncrowd-surfers create a welcoming atmosphere. After the per-form ance, the band compare\ntonight's reception with past\nexperiences: \"Yeah I 've been\nhere twice before, this is the\nthird time. I didn't actually\nenjoy the first two years but\ntonight was... good. You hear\nabout these gigs where there's like six people at the front and\neveryone else is at the bar. No,\ntonight was great.\"\nTrying to dig for the real reasons\nof the group's \"split\" three years\nago is near impossible as\nVuckovic cleverly skirts over\nmore personal details. He\nappears hurt by the music bus i ness. His opinion of those who\ndecide the fate of all in the\nmusic scene is critically brutal:\n\"Big record labels just don't know how to manufacture rock\nbands - they have no knowledge or contact with the general public. Bands like Led\nZeppelin sold thousands of\nalbums without releasing one\nsingle.\n(Continued on Page 21)\ni music.felix@ic.ac.uk Have you made your Christmas list yet?\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX SCIENCE11 James Bond: Sex, suave ... and\nDid you know that two-fifths of the Earth's population has seen a Bond movie, in the 40\nyears since Dr No was released? And in that\ntime he has killed 150 people and had sex\nwith 44 women. The latter statistic is quite\nimpressive considering that 48 year-old\nX ray specs - real or fantasy?\nPierce Brosnan (or 56 year-old Roger Moore,\nas he was in his last Bond role) would probably require 12-24 hours to recover between\norgasms.\nBond's signature drink, a vodka-martini -shaken but not stirred - is vodka and dry\nvermouth shaken up to add bubbles. This\nmakes the drink less oily than if it was\nstirred. According to scientists at the university of Western Ontario, shaking a martini\ncan reduce the risk of cataracts, strokes and\nheart disease, because it increases the\nantioxidant activity in the drink.\nPeople like Bond have been shown to have\na \"thrill seeking gene\" that causes them to\nscience\nrelease too much of a chemical called\ndopamine into their brain. This chemical\ncontrols motivation and excessive amounts\nmakes the person thrive on seeking out\nexcitement. Instead of running away from\ndanger they are more prepared to take risks.\nMen have been shown to be higher risk takers than women, because they think that\nbravery makes them more attractive.\nSo what about Bond's gadgets? How many\nof them would actually work? Take the x ray\nglasses he wore in \"The World is not\nEnough,\" to see concealed weapons that people were carrying. X rays are normally used\nin medical imaging and in airport security to\nview bones or metal objects. The machines\nthat produce the x rays are considerably larger than a pair of glasses and require the subject to stand still for a few seconds.\nWhat about the underwater breather that\nBond used in \"Thunderball,\" that allowed\nhim to breathe for about 4 minutes?\nCurrently the smallest breather is about the\nsize of a drinks can, holds half a litre of air\nand lasts for about two minutes. So unfortunately, James, your device is impossible.\nHow about the jet pack that Bond wore in\n\"Thunderball,\" to fly over a high wall? Well\nthis pack is real and was developed by the\nUS army and releases high pressure nitrogen\ngas to lift a person over 9 metres.\nUnfortunately it can only work for 30 seconds and so was scrapped.\nFinally, how realistic are the master plans\nof the Bond villan s? Take Auric Goldfinger's plan to make the US gold reserves at Fort\nKnox radioactive by dropping an atomic\nbomb on them. This would actually have the\neffect of turning the gold into mercury\nbecause the radioactive form of gold is very\nunstable and decays to mercury within a few\ndays.\nThen consider Ernst Blofeld's plan in \"On\nHer Majesty's Secret Service,\" to render all\nlifeforms infertile with the \"Omega virus\".\nViruses such as the mumps can lead to male\nFlying Bond?\nsterility and the herpes virus can cause infertility in many mammals. There are also viruses that can cause sterility in plants. Blofeld's plan to create a single virus that will cause\nall animals and plants to be sterile is, how-ever, a bit ambitious because viruses rely on\nthe make-up of their 'host' to survive.\nSo my conclusion is that there are real is it ic things in Bond films, but most of the gadgets\nand villa nous plans are, at the moment, fan-t as y. This does not stop them from being\ngreat films though...\nFor more information see bbc.co.uk/sci-en ce or visit the James Bond exhibition at\nthe Science Museum.\nIC Scientist Profiles\n#2 Professor Sir Derek Barton (1918 -1998)\nProfessor Derek Barton was\nborn in Kent\nand graduated with a BSc in\nChemistry\nfrom Imperial College in 1940\nand got his PhD, also from\nImperial, in 1942. After working\nin military intelligence during the\nSecond World War, he rejoined\nImperial College as a lecturer in\nphysical chemistry.\nBarton's work on steroid isomers during th 1940's was to\nearn him, and Norwegian\nchemist Odd Hassel, the Nobel\nPrize in Chemistry in 1969. This\nwork showed chemists how the\nreactivity of functional groups in\nste rio ds depended on their shape\nand position, and changed the\nway chemists thought about how\nshape related to the reactivity of\nmolecules.\nBarton also developed an innovative way to synthesis e the\nsteroid hormone aldo ster one by a process he pioneered which is\nnow known as the Barton\nReaction.\nAfter retiring from Imperial in\n1978, Barton became the director of the Natural Products\nInstitute, in France, where he\nstudied the chemistry of radi-cal s. In 1986 he moved to Texas\nA&M University where he continued to work in radical chemistry\nand on the oxidation of hydro car bons.\nRosie Chandler\nscience.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

A submarine movie made by Americans that glorifies\nthe Soviets.

As stories go,\nit's quite an effective one, centred on a true\nstory of the ill-fated voyage of the Soviet \"super-sub\" during the height of the Cold War. The\neffects, while not being anywhere near as good\nas those in U571(I love the depth-charge\nsequence in that movie - great for tuning sub-woofers), are good and the soundtrack is quite\nstirring. But the dod gy Russian accents, the\nclich e ridden script and the general stodginess\nof the movie drags this particular fish down into\nthe depths of film dross. Where it belongs,\nfrankly. The worst Harrison Ford movie I 've ever\nseen (yes, that includes Sabrina) and only really appealing to the die-hard Submariner.\nSi\nTHE TIME MACHINE STARRING: DIRECTED BY: CERTIFICATE: RUNNING TIME: RELEASE DATE: GUY PEARCE, MARK ADDY SIMON WELL SPG95 MINS DU T NOW ON DVD Recent special effects driven re-adaptation of the\nclassic H.G. Wells tale of time-travel and\nMorlocks. I enjoyed this movie for the first half-an-hour or so, but was then gutted to find it totally\nlosing its way from then onwards. I 've seen a few\nof the previous movies based on the book (there\nhave been many, most notably the 1960 George\nPal version) and this one fails to hold a torch to\nthem despite boasting a great lead in Pearce,\ndirection by Wells' great-grandson and a huge\neffects budget. The plot begins promisingly and\nthe movie looks fantastic, but the minute that\nPearce travels forwards in time it rapidly becomes\na confusing sequence of events that bear all the\nsigns of a rush job. It's as if Wells Jr. lost interest\nhalf way through and decided to get the thing\ndone so he could meet Ms Mumba down the pub\nfor a swift half. Which is a shame because it\nlooked promising. I mean, 95 minutes for The\nTime Machine? Ah well. The DVD extras are average at best, with a promising (but disappointing)\ncommentary from Wells and not much else. They\ncould have at least sprung for asean ce to contact\nH.G. and ask for his opinion...

Sort of. Picture\nthe scene - an idyllic island somewhere miles\naway from civilisation. A country (Japan) with\nan over-population problem. Put two and two\ntogether and if you come up with 7.9 then\nyou'll have sus sed the solution - take classes\nof school children to the island, give them a selection of weaponry and the last girl or boy\nstanding wins the right to become a member\nof society.\nOh yes, this is one sick film - but it is much\nmore too. In amongst the violence (which I would rate as \"ultra\" grade brutality by the\nway) there are some great moments of\nteenage anguish as well as some touching\nscenes - particularly in the special edition\n(which has the extra scenes spliced into the\nfeature). An odd movie, but for any Japanese\nmovie fan or Horror aficionado, a must see. It\neven includes the staple \"Makes No Sense\"\nending, which in my book is the mark of a truly classic Japanese film - I have enjoyed\nmany a Manga movie and am yet to understand the final message.\nApparently there will be a re-release of\nFukasaku's earlier work on DVD soon - none\nof which I have seen (apart from Tora!

    "content": "FELIX BOOK REVIEWS15 Hello there my innocent little ones. This week's theme for your education and enlightenment is Evilness and it comes in as many fantastic\nflavours as my big bag of sweets. First we've got a book about a true master of nastiness - American Psycho. / know this was written when\nsome of you were mere babies and you've all seen the film, but frankly the film made me laugh. The book is much more dark and disturbing\nand deserves to be read.\nIf you fancy a bit of DIY evil then we've also got a review of I was a Teenage Dominatrix with practical hints and tips for paying your way through\ncollege. Don't say I don't do anything for you. Interestingly, it was much easier to get someone to review this book than any other. Maybe you'll\nsee a theme appearing in the future.... Roz\nIy BRET\nEASTON\nELLIS\nSickeningly compelling from\nstart to finish, Bret Easton Ellis'\nmost famous and most lauded\nnovel is one of those reads that\ncan not be forgotten easily; our\nworld is shown to us through the\nmind of Patrick Bateman - a world of big money, misogyny\nand casual murder.\nPatrick Bateman is young,\nAmerican Psycho\nBret Easton Ellis\nhandsome and has a successful\njob on Wall Street. He is also a self-confessed psychopath. In\nPatrick Bateman's mind, style\nand substance are one and the\nsame. His vulture's gaze picks\nout designer cuff-links, exclusive\nrestaurants, the newest must-have electronic gadgets and, of\ncourse, \"hard bodies\". The\nthreads of Ellis' prose weave in\nall of these things and, before\nlong, you are woven in too - an\naccomplice, a voyeur.\nThe real genius of Ellis lies in\nhis ability to create characters\nthat can be totally believable\ndespite them living at the\nextremes of human existence:\ncompassion less, vain and empty\n- there is little for the reader to\nfind sympathetic in Bateman.\nBut Bateman's insecurities about\nhis status and his looks make\nhim a tangible human being,\nalmost understandable - we\naren't even consoled by the\nthought that he is anything less\nthan human. But don't trust\nwhat Bateman says too much.\nEverything he tells the reader\nteeters on the edge of reality: the\nvideo-nasty murders, the action\nmovie escape from the police.\nRemember: this is his story and\nthis is his mind.\nAs murder follows murder, and\nbrutality and viciousness builds,\nEllis never lets the reader leave\nthe table; whenever you feel that\nyou have had enough, the deliciousness of Ellis' deathly dark\nhumour convinces you to take\njust one more bite - and then\nanother and another. Then, when\nhe has made you comfortable\nagain, with Titus-like pleasure\nEllis reminds you exactly what it\nis you are eating.\nAnd so, as Bateman eviscerates and decapitates, we come\nto realise: there is no escape.\nPicador; ISBN: 033049189X Patrick Hoar\nMi u\\\\\\ ii\\.1I was a Teenage Dominatrix\nShawn a Kenney\nI don't know about you, but verbally abusing nappy-wearing\nmen whilst forcing them to do\nthe hoover ing constitutes a fairly\ntypical Friday night. Okay, I do\nexaggerate slightly (often my\nboyfriends drew the line at\nhousework) but my point is that\nwhile 'domina trix' may not be\nthe most common entry on\nsomeone's CV, I'm not sure that,\nin this case, it necessarily merits\nan entire book to be dedicated to\nit. Maybe I'm just bitter because\nShawna Kenney made a living\nfrom being a mouth y, moody,\nbitch whereas I do it for nothing.\nStill, I'm not convinced.\nBeginning with the obligatory\n'I was happy despite being a poor/ugly/fat/tom-boyish child',\nthe introduction to / Was a Teenage Dominatrix describes\nhow, too poor to have lessons,\nShawna decides to learn how to\nswim by throwing herself in the\ndeep end. Fortunately for the literary world, Shawna doesn't drown but I think the lack of oxygen to her head for the few seconds she was submerged\nexplains a lot. Starting college,\nShawna searches for a decently\npaid job. A brief and unsuccessful flirtation with exotic dancing\nprecedes a party where she\nrealises her dom tendencies. The\nrest of the book meanders its\nway through the underground\nworld of the sex industry, with\nShawna, under her new guise of\nMistress Alexis, recounting tales\nof interesting punters, bizarre\nrequests and the obligatory\nspilling of a disturbing variety of\nbody fluids.\nDespite its interesting subject,\n/ Was a Teenage Dominatrix (like\nour neighbourhood postman)\nsimply fails to deliver. Pitched\nsomeone between Sweet Valley\nHigh and Topsy and Tim Go\nWhoring, Kenney tries to be controversial and shocking but simply comes across schmaltzy and\nbanal. Indeed, it shows a certain\namount of skill to produce such\nan uninspiring book from such\npotentially juicy subject matter.\nThe fact that the book was\nvoted 'most likely to be banned'\nby independent publishers in the\nUS unfortunately appears to say\nmore about the conservatism of\nthe States rather than the nature\nof the book. Still, it makes a mildly amusing read, the kind of\nthing you want when you're desperately trying to put off an\nassignment. Personally, I'd put\nthe \u00a35.99 towards a new PVC\ndog leash; you never know when\nit'll come in handy.\nCorgi Adult; ISBN: 0552150258\nChrissie Giles\nbooks.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX NIGHTLIFE NightLife\nTorture Garden Halloween Party\n@ Club Colloseum\n'Due to venue licensing no exposed genitalia'.\nThis sign, displayed in various prominent\nlocations around Torture Garden's new home,\nColloseum in Vauxhall, does tell you quite a lot\nabout the club itself, most people attending\nhave far fewer inhibitions than your average\nclub ber. But there are a number of quite clear\nrules that must be obeyed for the club to continue to function and to keep having the huge\namount of success that it has enjoyed over the\npast eleven and a half years.\nThese rules are really very simple: first and\nforemost harassment of any kind is not to ler at ed, and will be dealt with severely: you are\nhence far less likely to receive unwelcome\nphysical advances here than you are, for\nexample, on an average Wednesday night at\nHombres (shiver).\nSecondly, you must make an effort with your\noutfit: street wear and regular club wear are not\npermitted, dressing up is the key, but there\ndoes tend to be an emphasis on rubber,\nleather, PVC and corse try. You don't need to be\nseriously into Fetishism of any kind to enjoy\nTG, you just have to be open minded and non-judgmental. It also helps if you enjoy hard\nhouse.\nThere are five areas to TG, which are fairly\nwell separated throughout the club. The music\nin the club arena varies from breakbeat to hard\nhouse with residents James Schaeffer and\nAllen TG, and one or two guest DJs. The quality of DJing is, to be fair, often suspect, and\ntonight was no exception, but this didn't stop\nthe crowd from loving it.\nThe other dance floor was in the electron-i que boutique, where Eyeball Licker, Pandora's Jukebox and Erol Alkan played eclectic NuDisco and Electroclash and provided a good\nbreak from the pounding of the main arena.\nThe 'voodoo' lounge area, was playing a mixture of lounge, swing and rock'n 'roll, but\nwith a definite TG edge to it from David TG\nand Gimme-A Fix, which lead to a particularly\nsurreal atmosphere.\nFinally there is the Dungeon area, which\nwhile not as dungeon-like as the same area at\nMass (the previous venue) is still fully\nequipped with a wide range of harnesses,\nframes and the like for those wishing to play.\nTG is obviously not for everyone, but it does\nhave one of the friendliest, non-threatening\natmospheres of any club of its kind,and indeed\nof any that I have heard of. You really don't need to enjoy S&M to have a good time, but\ndon't go if you have a problem with seeing it in\naction.\nAlex C Fetish Bazarr @ Purple Turtle\nEvery Sunday\n12 - 6pm Free entry\nMornington Crescent tube\nSeed Sessions @ Purple Turtle\nEvery Sunday\n6pm midnight\nFree entry\nNon fetish, same music policy\nMornington Crescent tube\nwww.torture garden. com\nCompetition\nOooooh, you lucky, lucky people. Thanks to the\ngorgeous people at The Cross we have two\ntickets to give away to Prologue at The Cross\non the 7th December.\nIf you don't know anything about Prologue,\nwell you damn well should. If you've managed\nto get this far through the issue you really\nshould have noticed the review by Kenneth\nand Peter on the opposite page. If not, read it\nnow, we can wait... read it? Sounds excellent,\ndoesn't it.\nNow that your appetite has been whet you\nshould run to the nearest computer and enter\nour amazing competition. Come on, it means\nyou don't have to pay to get into a club, that's a free night (apart from drinks obviously). The\nonly other way you can get free nights around\nhere is to join the reviewing team at Felix,\nwhich we seriously recommend that you do, or\nyou could just send in reviews of places you've\nbeen. Please.\nAnyway, the question:\nName any other regular night at The Cross\nexcept Prologue.\nSend your entries to clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\n(along with any reviews you care to send in)\nbefore Tuesday 3rd December including your\nname and contact telephone number so we\ncan let you know if you are the lucky winner.\nDon't worry, none of this information will\nleave the Felix offices.\nRemember, anything you want to send in\nclubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\nTim and Dom\nclubs.felix@ic.ac.uk ..with mind bullets!\n\n"

J..^. fr ' *\nWorld Soc Where will the Children play? packed out db's last Thursday, with an almost entirely Muslim\naudience listening to presentations from journalist Yvonne Ridley and a Save a Nation representative. Returning from a prayer session, \"broth-ers\" and \"sisters\" congregated round tables on\ntheir respective sides of the room, filling the time\nbefore queuing for food by chatting to their\nneighbours and munching on biscuits. Once\neveryone had finished their rice, spiced stew\nand sweet (all provided by a restaurant and the\nMalaysian and Pakistani socs) the chair started\nthe evening with a brief talk from one of the\nIslamic soc's \"sisters\", before introducing the\nspecial guest.\nMs Ridley did not come across as being at\nease, and gave what I felt to be an over fervent\ninterpretation of the present situation in Iraq and\nPalestine. This opinion is clearly subjective and\ndebatable, yet I felt slightly vindicated when the\nfloor was opened to questions, and many people\ntentatively put forward mild versions of Ms\nRidley's assertions. The Islamic Relief speaker\n(Jehangir Malik?) who followed was a more natural orator, and gave an impassioned plea on\nbehalf of the Iraqi children, convincingly making\na case for personal and family donations from all\npresent. On a very trivial note, the new brands\nof cola from the Middle East, Zam Zam and\nMedia andRe ll gion Aztec Statues at the Royal Academy\nMecca were suggested as alternatives to the\nubiquitous Coke and Pepsi.\nIsrael and the media's guest speaker, the\nTimes' assistant editor Michael Gove, unfortunately had to postpone his visit. Fortunately for\nJewish soc, Shimon Shamilla, a representative\nof the Betar & Tagar movement attending, had\nagreed to take his place. As his speciality did not\nlie in the media, the talk was not intended to\nfocus on that topic. Instead, after a brief history\nof the Middle East from his point of view, he\nopened the floor to questions from the audience,\nhalf of whom were of radically differing opinions.\nNot to put too fine a point on it, bedlam ensued,\nwith the chairs just managing to keep a cap on\nthings. Semantics, rhetoric, \"statistics\" and\nignoring opponents' inconvenient points\nabounded from both sides in a bitter match.\nIncidental to the proceedings, Mr Shamilla's answer to the eponymous question suggested\nthat European Media may be attempting to\ncompensate for a colonialist past by supporting\nthe perceived underdog.\nThe BIG bell tolls a week from next Tuesday\nfor India, Norway, Mauritius and Indonesia...\nDiary: You might be able to follow the newly\nformed Latin American society to the Aztec\nexhibition at the Royal academy this evening at\n6, though you'll have to buy your own tickets.\nI'm rather cheesed off to be away for the highlight of a festival of films by Japanese director\nAkira Kurosawa at the ICA. Seven Samurai is\nplaying for the 27th to the 29th of December, so\ntry to catch it if you're here during the break, or\nfilms such as Rashomon, which are on before.\nThat's enough, since mentioning any more films\nnow will lead to academic disaster as I have to\nkeep up appearances by watching them. Ed\nFI nc us If you are an average British newspaper reader these days, you\ncould be forgiven for thinking that\nNigeria is full of rampaging mobs\nrunning around burning down\nbuildings while trying to kill beauty queens for being beautiful. You\nwould also have heard phrases\nsuch as \"second most corrupt\ncountry in the world\" and \"pro-duce s talented but inconsistent\nfootballers.\" Well, two out of three\nisn't bad.\nNigeria has 115 million people,\nmost of whom hail from the 3 [of\n350! Ed] main tribes, the Yoruba,\nHausa and Igbo (in the west, north\nand east respectively); all neatly\ndivided by two rivers, the Niger\nand the Benue. Enough facts, let's talk about why Nigeria's great.\nThere is great diversity all across\nNigeria, with each tribal and ethnic group having a distinct identity\nand language, making it seem like\nmany countries within one. This\ndiversity accounts for a lot of what\nmakes Nigeria good. I could start\nto expound on the absolute wealth\nof culture and give genuine reasons to make this your holiday\ndestination (will you all please\nstop sniggering!) but there isn't enough space. Instead I shall talk\nabout the greatest thing about\nNigeria, the people.\nNt geri a/y' 'Cages'\n' 'Cages'\n\u2022\nTo meet a Nigerian is to find a good thing: a good Nigerian friend\nwill be loyal; a good Nigerian mum\nwill stuff you full of food (and good\nstuff it is too, no fish and chips); a good Nigerian aunt will smother\nyou with affection and advice, just\ndon't get on her bad side!!! A good Nigerian Dad will make sure\nyou are taken care of to the best of\nhis ability, sometimes to the point\nof trying to find a good girl for you.\nLife in Nigeria can be a blast\nand the best time of your life. The\neconomic situation aside, I can't think of anywhere better to grow\nup. When you get around\nNigerians, the general sense of fun\nand laughter can get you through\nalmost anything.\nHaving said that, you want to be\ncareful which Nigerian you hand\nyour wallet to, because when\nNigerians turn bad, you do not\nwant to be anywhere in the vic in i ty. Hence the news headlines that\ngenerally say: \"Don't ever think of\ngoing near Nigeria, ever\"\nI say it's the kind of place that\nmakes you believe in God, the only\nway you'll truly survive. Find out\nfor yourself: find a Nigerian, latch\nonto them and discover what\nmakes this nation a place brimming with potential.\nWait for the day we get our footballers sorted out, that World Cup\nis just waiting to have our name\non it! Oluwatosin Ajayi\nAfter the Teletubbies, Mr Bean is\nprobably the most universal\nBritish TV export. In a similar\nvein, and also seen at rerun season the world over is the other\nman of silence, Benny Hill.\nChances are that you'll have\nseen his antics (Yes you have;\nhe's the dirty old man being\nchased to funny music). If it's this sort of slap(and tickle)-stick\nyou're into, you should investigate the Carry on films. Crude\nand saturated with innuendo,\nthey're perfect as a counter foil to\nanything with pretensions. You'll\ncatch them on TV as the time for\nold favourites (and chestnuts)\ndraws near. Men Behaving\nBadly is a more recent series, in\na similar vein, which may throw\nsome light upon contemporary\nBritish culture, at least on the\nheavy drinking part. Ask any\npaid up member of \"lad\" culture\nto expound upon this series, or\nbetter, to show you some -they're likely to oblige as it is\nvery popular.

    "content": "FELIX MUSIC REVIEWS Sigur Ros\n0\n^TOums & Singles,\n3/5\nThe band from Iceland, who sing in\ntheir own personal language, are\nback with a new album. In the vein\nof so many bands (Radiohead) it\nseems that they are trying to be\nslightly more experimental with\ntheir music in each progressive\nalbum, and I'm concerned that they\nmay already have reached their\npeak with the previous one. This\nalbum has therefore succeeded in\nleaving the listener with some\nmind-blowing tracks, and some\nthat seem fit to be from the soundtrack of the latest M Night\nShyamalan movie.\nThe ethereal wailing s of the lead\nsinger are still very much at the\nforefront of the musical style, and\nthe low-keyboards and moaning\n(violin bowed) guitars still provide\nyou with the atmospheric qualities\nthat you have come to expect from\nthis band, but somehow it all\nsounds very much like they're doing\nall this because they feel they have\nto do something 'different'. Perhaps\nthey really are on a spiritual journey,\nbut given the choice of listening to\nthis or 'Agaetis Byrjun', I'm afraid it\nwould be the latter every time.\nHaving said all this, it is still a stunning collection of songs that\ngive you the feeling that you have\nleft planet earth, and have at least\nmade a pit stop on the outer rims of\nthe solar system, where comets\nfreeze to the sound of heavily distorted guitars, and planets quake\nwith full orchestral swell.\nIf you liked the last album, you\nwill probably enjoy this one, and I would advise you that it is worth\nthe price for several of the songs\nalone. If you haven't heard these\nguys before, go out and get 'Agaetis\nByrjun', and then, if you like them,\ngo back out and get ( ). But, even\nafter listening to it four or five times,\nit hasn't got the raw surrealism and\nbewitching mood that grabbed me\nwhen I first heard 'Svefn-G Englar',\nand I'm concerned that while this is\na great album to listen to when\n'relaxing', these guys may already\nbe on the way back down from\nwhat must have been a fantastic\ntrip. Will\nDavid Bowie\nThe Best Of\n4/5\nWith an astounding career spanning four decades, how anyone\ncan claim to put 'the best of David\nBowie' all on one double album is\nbeyond me, however this would\nbe my only criticism of this excellent compilation.\nWith a little something for\neveryone, the two CDs soar\nthrough his 25 or so albums with\nease, combining classic Bowie (if\none could coin such a phrase from\na man of so many faces and\nsounds) such as 'Space Oddity'\nand 'Life on Mars' with some of\nthe best collaborations around,\nlike 'Under Pressure' with Queen,\nand 'Dancing in The Street' with\nMick Jagger to name but two.\n(Will and Gareth, you could stand\nto learn a thing or two here).\nHighlights for me personally\ninclude 'Starman', 'John I'm Only\nDancing' (a lesser known gem)\nand 'Absolute Beginners', the\nbeauty of this compilation is that\neveryone can and will have their\nown favourites.\nAll tracks are digitally remastered, and although I'm not sure\nZiggy Stardust will ever be the\nsame without that good old LP\ncrackle, the chronological move\nthrough the albums is smoother\nwith all tracks being of a similar\nsound quality.\nThere are few surprises here but\nalso no notable absences, so for\ndiehard Bowie fans, whilst there\nwill be little new here for you, it is\na good collection to own, and really takes you through the highlights\nof his whole career. Although initially sceptical about what a rehash of every hit put together\ncould gain, especially after a number of 'Best of and Singles\nCollections have already been\nreleased, this album really is\nsomething special. For those new\nto the phenomena that is David\nBowie (if such a concept is p ossi ble), curious, or never really had\nthe opportunity to experience his\nmusic, this album really is a good\nplace to start. Katy\nSingles\nvega4 Drifting Away\nViolently EP\nThis strange mix of a band\n(apparently all 4 members\ncome from various far flung\nreaches of the Commonwealth)\nare one of the latest signings to\nTaste Media (famous for being\nthe home of Muse). This EP\ncontains four tracks that made\nme feel c huffed that there may\nactually be an alternative to ali\nthe pop rubbish in the charts\nthese days.\nMost of you reading this will\nremember how massive\nRadiohead were in 1997 and\nwhen the Verve's 'Urban\nHymns' was top of the charts.\nThis album takes elements of\nthese styles and moulds it into\nsomething of their own. vega4 have taken the pace of\nRadiohead's guitar riffs and\ndropped the depression and\nteenage angst from the lyrics.\nThey've replaced this with\neuphoric, an the mic lyrics and\n| a somewhat cheerier approach\nto the whole music-writing\nthing. The title track is a bit\nlivelier than the other tracks,\nwhich are more along the lines\nof modern day ballads sung\nwith a bit of well y. Also being compared to Led\nZep and Fugazi at this embryonic stage in their career, this\nband has lots of potential and\nwe will probably see them go\ndown the road of proving\nthemselves to be enigmatic\nperformers with real vigour.\nThe single 'Drifting Away\nViolently' is out on 9th December and they'll be touring the UK at the start of that\nmonth. The intensity of this\nband's music jumps out at you\nwhen you have your first listen\nto their songs and I would definitely recommend all those\ndispossessed indie-rock kids\nout there to get a load of this\nand restore your faith in the\nmusic industry.\n5/5 Katherine\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk Dave Grohl speaks in Felix - don't hold your breath!\n\n"

The\nservice is there to enable students\nto get home from the union safely\nwho otherwise couldn't, for example women by themselves.\nIt is currently rumoured that the\nunion would like to stop the service running as a way of cutting\ncosts. This is a prime example of\nour union putting penny-pinching\nbefore the safety of students -what would the union do if a student was attacked on their way\nhome when they would have been\nsafely dropped at their door by the\nminibus. In order to make the\nwithdrawal of the service less\nobvious there has been little or no\nadvertisement of its existence\nafter the first couple of weeks of\nterm, when a drive to recruit new\nstaff for the service failed.\nThe service at present is being run\nby a small number of committed\nstudents, and we are always looking for more people to help.

When he\ndemanded that the astronaut\nswear on a Bible that he had\nwalked on the moon, Mr Aldrin\nopted to punch Mr Sibrel in the\nface.\nMade my day!\nEditorial BitchSlap\nDear Will,\nWhile your editorial probably\nwasn't aimed at me, the point\nabout \"vocational\" degrees is that\nthey purport to be vocational\nwhen they are not. Take a( hope-fully) hypothetical degree in fruit\npicking. Will it ensure you get a job picking fruit? No. Fruit pickers\nalready provide on the job train-ing, they will not have had significant input into the degree course,\nand they will probably be looking\nfor people to meet physical rather\nthan academic requirements.\nSimilarly, UK universities now\nchurn out so many people with\nmedia studies degrees that there\nis no correlation at all between\nobtaining such a degree and getting a job in the media, or even a job at all. On the other hand you\ndo acquire around \u00a320,000 of\ndebt. Yet the government persuades people to take up such\ndegrees on the basis that you will\nget a better job, and earn more\nmoney.\nThe government should certainly not be sub sidi sing such\ndegrees, not because it's a waste\nof public money but because it's a waste of the private money that\nthe main victims of this \"egalit ari an\" fraud pay. This is not intellectual fascism, physics and other\nsuch courses at universities like IC\nare truly vocational: At IC you are\nnot so much taught about physics,\nyou are taught to be a physicist.\nThe value of the degree to\nemployers (either the government\nor the city) is not your ability to\nreal off streams of equations, but\nyour ability to solve mathematical\nand physical problems. A non lab-based physics course would be as\nbig a fraud as the media study for\nprecisely the same reasons.\nWhat the government most certainly should sub sid is e are real\nvocational qualifications (like\napprenticeships) in partnership\nwith businesses. The students on\nsuch courses would have a far\nmore valuable qualification at the\nend, they would be more employable and as they are earning while\nlearning they won't be saddled\nwith \u00a320K of debt.\nSeb Tallents, Physics UG 3\nGood points, well made.

As long as you present\nyour IC swipe card at the till your\nVAT should be automatically\ndeducted from your bill along with\nthe 10% IC discount.\nAfter writing to Felix a few\nweeks ago about PG students not\nbeing able to get VAT relief in the\nSCR, I received a response from\ncatering manager Edward Lilley.\nHe apparently knew nothing about\nit, but I'd like to thank him for\nspeedily resolving this with some\ntill reprogramming. I would also\nlike to say that I was a bit disappointed that the union president\ndid not see fit to respond to my\nquery about how to rectify what\nwas essentially a student issue,\nespecially when I got such a helpful and positive assistance from\nthe Rector's office.\nI'm also wondering if IC catering\nmight want consider donating the\nVAT overcharged since\nAugust/September to charity, I'm sure that the Children in Need\nappeal is still running.\nJenny Rickerby\nDamovo-no-no\nDear Felix,\nAfter having paid for '24 hour,\nun-metered Internet access from\nStudent Connect, I have a slight\ncomplaint - I don't have it, and I was wondering if others were suffering the same problem. Let me\nrecount a little tale...\nThe first week at Imperial, after\nsigning up, the speeds and reliability were exceptional - I was getting more than my money's worth.\nA couple of weeks after that, as\nmore people signed up and starting the service, predictably the\nspeeds decreased, but were perfectly acceptable.\nNow: speeds a slug on Prozac\nwould be ashamed of and a service as reliable as British Rail.\nWhen we do have a connection, it\nis almost entirely unusable.\nAfter contacting Damovo a few\ntimes the response seems to be\nthe same; hardware problem, the\nengineers are working on it, no\nidea when it'll be fixed, maybe lots\nof people are using the net, please\ndon't stop paying us.\nThis isn't just a isolated case\neither, this is affecting at least all\nthe rest of us here at Fisher Hall,\npossibly the rest of Evelyn\nGardens and from what I have\ngleaned from the IC Grape Vine\nother halls and residences as well.\nI find it slightly shameful that\nthe company Imperial College of\nScience, Technology and Medicine\nuses for student net access can't even let me check my mail. I would welcome a response from\nDamovo, as long as it didn't go\nalong the lines of the above!\nISE1 at Fisher Hall\nDamovo are aware of the situ a tion, and have assured me it's a tempo roar y problem. They are\nalso starting a feedback forum in\nnext term's Felix\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX SPORT Sports Shorts Thirds Thrashing\nFootball\nIC V80 Kings V It was a game of two halves. In\nthe first half we scored 3, and in\nthe second we scored 5. However,\nthe score line only tells half the\nstory of the latest chapter in the\nepic rivalry between IC and Kings.\nFrom the off, it was backs to the\nwall stuff - for obvious reasons, as\nwe were playing Kings.\nWe set our stall out early on giving 110% knowing the final score\nwould affect the result. The breakthrough came from Phil, on his\ndebut for the fifths, with a majestic lob over the flailing keeper. The\nsecond came after great work from\nSprout, a Dowbor-type step-over\nfrom Hideki and a cool finish from\nGucci. Kings heads didn't drop\nthough and they keep plugging\naway. But with Dave \"The\nLawnmower\" Yates covering every\nblade of grass on the pitch the\nkiller blow came on the stroke of\nhalf-time from Hideki after confusion in the box. The fourth came\nsoon after half-time from Gucci\nand it was curtains for Kings. IC\nwere rampant and put them to the\nsword. Phil completed his hattrick and two goals from Leon,\nafter a masterful tactical substitution from the captain, completed\nthe rout. It would have been more\nbut Sprout couldn't hit a cows arse\nwith a banjo. Captain Caruso was\nthrilled with the result but quickly\nput the teams feet back on the\nground, told us not to get carried\naway and take each game as it\ncomes, \"Seriously lads, big game\nWednesday...\"\nLadies Hockey\nIC II 6 - 0 Essex\nWe are the best!\nRugby\nIC II 24 - 5 Chichester\nAggregate Score of 91-5\nFootball\nIC III 5 - 0 Southbank II\nAfter having lost to Essex in the previous match the game against\nSouthbank seconds was a must-win\ngame for us to remain in the top\nthree of the BUSA league. The start\nwas fairly intimidating with the\nopposition having some rather skillful players showing good technique\nwho were able to get some good\npassing together looking quite dan-gero us. Then James O 'Prey threaded a through ball to Alex De Luca\nwho made a run down the left to\nscore making up for missing a similar chance just minutes before.\nThe fight back was immediate\nwith their captain hitting the bar\nwith a shot from outside the area\nand a wonderful save from Tom\nClifton who was able to get down to\nsave another chance. But we always\nlooked threatening, getting some\ngood moves along the wings but\nunfortunately not following through.\nThen we got another goal with a good run from Dominic down the\nright who centred the ball to Alex\nwho then finished it to make it two.\nThey were starting to lose control\nand we didn't have to wait long for\na third goal with a pass from Alex\n\"Gabba\" Edwards to Simone whose\nclose range shot was parried by the\nkeeper back off him into the net. In\nthe second half they came out looking stronger and better organised\nbut our back three held firm and\nthey started to show their frustration\nwith one of the players kicking the\nball away several times. The game\nwas killed off when Dan deep in our\nhalf, passed down the left for Alex to\nrun onto and cross to Simone who\nfired past the keeper. After this they\ntried a retaliation but everything that\nwas able to get past midfield and\nthe defence was blocked by Tom.\nThe icing was put on after Gabba\nsquared it unselfishly to Phil to give\nus a resounding 5-0 victory and a good chance of qualifying for the\nBUSA Vase.\nsport.felix@ic.ac.uk All match and event reports are welcome.\n\n"

    "content": "VIRGINS FELIX Virgins Score Twice\nLadies Rugby\nIC Virgins 10 - 5 RHUL\nThe Virgin's winning streak continues with an outstanding victory\nover Royal Holloway on Sunday.\nA strong start saw the Virgin's camped in their 22 for the majority of the first half. With uncontested scrum s at their request -Lumpy took the ball off the back\nand ran blind again and again,\ngaining ground each time. She was\nreally on form, biff ing her way\nthrough player after player, performing a delicate pirouette before\nslamming the ball over the line for\nour first try. This was quickly followed by Aiofe who was playing\nout of position at fly half -doing a blinding job too - broke through\nthe line, side stepped the full back,\nsprinted three quarters of the\nlength of the field and scored\nunder the posts.\nThe fought back hard, and we\ndefended our five yard line for half\nan hour before they finally scored.\nDespite Lumpy's attempts at drop\ngoals there were sadly no conversions. Spatch's family came to spec-tate in the unrelenting rain, but\nMother Spatch was more entertained by her 'chunky legs' than in\nthe rugby itself. The virgin's look\nforward to Wednesday and indeed\nthe next three columns.\nLadies Rugby\nRHUL 5 - 0 IC Virgins\nWe all undertook the mammoth\ntrek out to Egham - which does-n't even have an 020 area code\n- for the rematch, this time in\nthe BUSA league, with the\nVirgins knowing they would\nleapfrog the country bumpkins in\nthe league were they to win...\nthe stakes were high indeed.\nIt wouldn't be a proper match\nreport without the standard non\nrugby announcements. The most\nimportant thing is that we have\nour very first virgin engage-ment... lush Snotty-Posh will be\nsporting a sparkling ring and will\nshow it to all who ask. We also\nhave to say goodbye to an old\ngirl, Minor, who has been playing for us for about 5 years - noone can remember exactly how\nlong - and now she's off around\nthe world on her electives, and\nthis represents major loss to the\nteam.\nAnyway, on with the match.\nHaving played with uncontested\nscrum s on Saturday we made\nsure that this wouldn't be the\ncase for the return trip as the full\npower of our forwards wanted to\nbe unleashed. However after\ninjuring their hooker in the first\nfive minutes the ref decided that\nfor safety's sake the opposition\nA few of the many Virgins in the Union that fateful night\nThank them for all the songs they were singing...\nwould again be allowed to play\nlike girls.\nThe game was a very scrappy\naffair, mainly due the fact that\nthe ref insisted on blowing up for\nevery minor infringement that\nmight have inconvenienced the\nopposition. Not that we're bit-ter.... After about twenty minutes\nplay they managed to come off a five yard scrum and power the\nball over the line - although there\nwas gallant defending we, for\nonce, weren't quick enough.\nFair enough, we thought, plenty of time to get it back, especially with us dominating the lush\nrunning play, when it happened.\nThis was not to be the case, how-ever, as the ref blew up for half\ntime after a mere half an hour:\nwe weren't aware that this had\nbeen arranged, but that was primarily because it hadn't. Our lush\nrugby skills - ruc king, mauling,\ntackling, running, the lot - were\nrightly praised in the refreshing\nhalf time team, and we were\nback on the pitch raring to go.\nThe second half was pretty\nmuch the same as the first, with\nsome storming runs, especially\nfrom our lush full back Ash. The\nbacks supported each other well,\nand if our handling had been as\ngood as our running we would\nhave one by a mile - sorry for-wards.\nWe were camped on their 22\nfor some time, but the uncontested scrum s meant that their\nfull back had more than enough\ntime to clear the lines after\nscrum s so we had to keep re-tak-ing the same ground. Ash went\noff injured but came back on the\nplay with a limp. Bendy was carried off - i knew that it was only\na matter of time before she got\ninjured. Credit has to go to\nBaggy for putting in a proper low\ntackle on their only Heifer. In\nuncontested scrum s have iw hinged enough yet? - our front\nrow especially mutts couldn't really strut their stuff but had a great game in the loose. Forward\nof the match had to be Jenny, for\nrunning off with the ball, for-wards, whenever she got it. Back\nof the match goes to Aoife for\nher storming runs down the\nfield. Bad luck to the Virgins for\nlosing a game that they generally wouldn't have done, but hopefully we'll get the points on a technicality.\nOh yes, i have to mention the\nstunning support from the\ninjured 'sometimes i don't recognise myself in the mirror' Dapps.\nAsh is lush, and for once the\nlovely Pinky doesn't get a mention - oops - and finally it should\nbe noted that Minor just chun-de red and Dan fell over in it.\nsport.felix@ic.ac.uk What's going on? I'm making time.\n\n"

    "content": ",1 J^^ m>\"1w04 FELIX Snowdon Blue\nSnowdonia is the second largest\nnational park in England and\nWales, covering some 2,171\nsquare kilometres of north west\nWales, and including the\nCarneddau, and Glyderau mountain ranges as well as the highest\nmountain in England and Wales\n(1085m/3560 ft) Yr Wyddfa (the\nTomb in welsh), or Snowdon from\nwhich the Park takes its (English)\nname. This was our destination,\nand a popular one too. We all\narrived at the union on Friday\nnight hoping to pile in the bus\nand set off for sunny Wales. This\nproved a little complicated, as the\nbus was blocked in and much\nfaff ing was required before we\ncould get it out and load it up at\nthe union. Eventually we all piled\nin. Enthusiastically I pulled the\npassenger door shut thinking we\nwere all ready to go.\nUnfortunately however that car\ndoor meet Matt's fingers on the\nway... Matt's fingers appeared to\nbe a bit dented from this experience and so we sought medical\nhelp. Thankfully there were no\nbreaks, and Matt was given the\nall clear to travel.\nSo off we poo t led, along the car\nparks that we English people call\nroads. We discovered a new chip-py in Daventry, and finally arrived\nat the hut at about 1.30am, at\nwhich point I walked in on one of\nthe other residents who was\nundressing at that precise\nmoment. In the morning we\namazed the climbers we were\nsharing the hut with by rising\npromptly at 7am. The weather\nlooked great so one group set off\nup Snowdon, and the other along\nthe Nantle Ridge. The Snowdon\ngroup later split as some took the\nCrib Goch route and some took a shorter route in order to allow\ntime for them to go shopping in\nBetws-y Coed. There were only\nfleeting views from the top of\nSnowdon, but the Nantle ridge\ngroup enjoyed amazing views of\nthe mountains and sea, and practiced a bit off their off path navigation too.\nAlex conjured up a wonderful\nSpaghetti Bolognaise for dinner,\nand we heated apple pies on the\nstove for pudding. Sam got the\nfire burning bright.... In fact it\nwas a bit like a sauna in there! As\nper usual a variety of classic\ngames and drinking followed\nincluding the corn flake box game,\nladder game and various other\ntests of strength, balance and stu-pid it y. The climbers had a distinct\nadvantage in most of these areas,\nbut there were some good efforts\nfrom Sarah and Matt in the corn-flake box game.\nAfter another late night we did\nourselves proud by rising yet\nagain at 7am, and setting off for\nCnict. Cnict is known as the\nWelsh Matterhorn, because if you\nlook at it from just the right angle,\nsquinting your eyes a bit, you can\nsort of see the resemblance with\nthe real Matterhorn. The weather\nwas truly glorious - blue sky and\nsunshine... you would hardly\nknow that we were in Wales at\nall! The climb up had us all pant-ing, but it was well worth it for\nthe amazing views across the\nnational park. We were particularly pleased to see that there was\nstill a little bit of cloud on the\nsummit of Snowdon.... it's nice to\nknow that even on a clear day you\nare still doomed not to get a view\nfrom it. After reaching the summit\nof Cnict we descended to an old\nslate quarry for lunch and then\nambled back to the bus in plenty\nof time for the journey home.\nWe left Snowdonia via one of\nthe smallest roads imaginable. I realised I had definitely chosen\nthe wrong seat when I found\nmyself getting out every five minutes in order to open a gate.\nEventually we made it onto\ndecent road only to find that the\nbus had lost most of its power.\nWe did a bit of investigation and\ndecided to carry on, as nothing\ntoo serious seemed to be wrong.\nStopping at the Wheatsheaf in\nCrick we found they no longer\nserved meals, and had to find a new pub, we were due some luck,\nand thankfully found a nice new\npub, which will no doubt become\na fell wanderers classic. The bus\ncontinued to play up a bit, but we\nmade it home before 11, which is\npretty good for us lot.\nAnother great weekend -Thanks to all who partook!\nIf you're interested in fell wanderers then look at our groovy\nwebsite:\nwww.su.ic.ac.uk/fell wanderers Rebecca\nimperial\n\u2022 college\nw if\ndj: bar: food chill every\nWednesday and friday\non the first floor\nof the union building\nplus: hot new catering menu\nPani ni\nChilli\nPizza\nChi ps\nOnion Rings\nMushrooms\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

While the theory is the same,\nthe process has now been named SOLEStudent On-Line Evaluation, in an attempt to\nshake off the negative image that LEQs\n(Lecturer Evaluation Questionnaires) managed\nto gain during their final round last year.\nFor those of you who are unaware, the\nLEQ/SOLE is a system that allows the students\nto evaluate how their lecturer is doing. The idea\nis that any problems with the teaching are then\nbrought to light in a secure system, which cannot be traced back to the student.\nWhile this is, in principle, a good idea, the\norganisation of such a system has always\nproved controversial, and last year this came to\na head when the system became electronic.\nWithin hours of the system coming online, it\nwas shown to be highly insecure by a group of\nstudent hackers within College. This had poor\nimplications for the anonymity of the system,\nArtist's Impression of our SOLE\nwhich ensured a dramatic drop in confidence\nwithin the student body.\nLast year's failed attempt at a joint system\nbetween the Union and College led to many\naccusations of a rushed job which were cited as\nthe reasons for the failure in security. This has\nprompted the Union to carefully examine its role\nin the proceedings this year, since a second year\nof failure would perhaps reflect worse on the\nUnion itself rather than College. After lengthy\nconsideration on the subject of security, Andrew\nSmith (Deputy President of Education &\nWelfare) and Sen Ganesh (President) decided\nthat they were not confident that a repeat performance of last year would not happen again.\nSpeaking to Felix, Mr. Ganesh said, \"We\nvalue the importance of student feedback on\nthe matter of teaching, but do not feel that there\nhas been enough testing for us to put a guarantee on the system's success.\"\nThis will certainly be seen as a 'bad thing' by\nall those within both the Union and College\nresponsible for quality of education, but Felix\nbelieves changing the name will not dispel the\nmemories of last year's fiasco. Several successful years will probably be required before confidence is once again restored. Will\nDramSoc Disciplined\nAt a meeting earlier this week,\nDramSoc - the society responsible\nfor almost all of the lighting,\npyrotechnics and well, just about\neverything exciting that goes on in\nthe union building - were given an\nofficial warning, and fined under\nUnion disciplinary regulations.\nThe exact details of the offense\nwere not available at the time of\ngoing to press, but it is believed\nthat they removed a number of\nbanned and/or hazardous substances from the Union building,\nin Beit Quad, without proper precautions being taken.\nThey plan to appeal the dec i sion, as it is claimed that they\nwere not given notice that action\nwould be taken were the substances in question to be\nremoved. Mr Ganesh claims to\nhave made this clear to them on a number of occasions, though\napparently no formal warning, as\nsuch, was ever issued.\nThis is the latest in a line of\nevents that seem to be separating\nDramSoc and the Union, between\nwhom a rift has been forming for\na number of months after the\nchange in Ents management.\nArtist's Impression of a Disaster\nWe will keep you updated as\nthe story progresses.

Unfortunately, due to\nits being overweight, it was not\nallowed to take part in the series.\nOver the months following this\ndenial, bits were cut off, and in\nsome cases welded back on to the\nIC. New fixtures were fashioned and\nfitted, then changed a bit and\nuntil in late May, we heard rumours\nthat qualifying for series 6 was to be\nheld in early July. With this in mind,\nwe upped the work rate just in case.\nIt was a good job we did, because in\nearly June we received confirmation\nthat we were due to attend qualifying at 09:30 on July 4th. As qualifying drew closer, we\nseemed in pretty good shape. A couple of days beforehand, we had\nthe IC driving around nicely. On the\nday before, we got aggressive and\nsmashed up a bin and an old filing\ncabinet - we thought they were\nlooking at us funny. We also found\nthat, as expected, spinning the IC\non the spot with the disk up to full\nspeed caused one wheel to lift up in\nthe air (by virtue of the magical\ngyroscopic effect). After one final\npractice, we put the IC in the back\nof Ray's car, and set off.\nFollowing an overnight stop, we\narrived at a disused military base at\nNewton, near Nottingham, and\nwaited to be checked in. First came\nthe weigh-in. Horror of horrors, the\n(rather suspect) scales read 105\nKg, 5 Kg over the limit. Fortunately,\nby putting the robot on the scales\nthe other way round - see what we\ndid there? - we were able to make it\nweigh 91 Kg. That's a good trick for\nany of you on diets at the moment.\nAfter getting through the weigh-in\nand various tech checks, we set up\non our bench and then waited for\nour turn to slash and burn. The format was a series of 4-way melee s with the winner going through to the\nTV show. The robots we were up\nagainst were called Double Trouble,\na box shape with two small spinning disks, GBH II, a racing car\nshape with double flipper, and some\ndod gy looking thing that had a name like Ripper.\nThe time came for our melee. We\nmade our way up into the control\npods and drove the IC out into the\narena. Ripper never made it out of\nthe holding pen, and so there were\nthree. The battle began. We got a good hit on Double Trouble quite\nearly on, which pierced their armour\nand damaged their transmission on\none side. GBH II had intermittent\nradio problems, so we hit them a few times, but didn't want to do\nthem too much damage while they\nwere immobile. Part of our polycarbonate armour split due to being\ncold formed into a curve, but luck i ly, no one got in to do any damage.\nBy the end of it all, Double Trouble's disks had both come off, GBH II had\na few gashes, but was otherwise\nfine, and we were still working, but\nwith superficial damage.\nWe came back down from the\ncontrol pods, deactivated the robot,\nand waited for the decision. We\nwere all well pleased when Bill\nHobbins, the producer, told us that\nit was a good fight, so all three\nrobots would be appearing on TV.\nWe were due back in three days, so\nhad the weekend to sort out our\narmour.\nOver the weekend, we replaced\nthe polycarbonate armour with thick\npolyethylene sewage pipe, generally\ntightened things up, and had a bit\nmore driving practice. On Sunday\nevening, we set off for Lincoln, and\na good night's sleep.\nWe left the robot charging up\novernight. In the morning, we took it\noff charge and decided it was a good idea to do a quick test. This\nplayed right into the hands of the\nevil stray screw hiding in one of our\nspeed controllers, which promptly\nexpired, causing one wheel to stop\nworking. The only thing we could do\nwas pack up, leave and sort it out\nwhen we got to the filming at\nNewton.\nJust as before, the first thing after\nour arrival was the weigh-in. The\nscales said 105 Kg, but this time\nthey were proper scales, so 105 Kg\nmeant 105 Kg. Houston, we had a problem! Fortunately, we half\nexpected to be a bit over, and had\nplanned to remove one of the two\nweapon drive motors if we needed\nto. I went and scrounged a new\nspeed controller while Ray and Gary\nremoved the motor,.\nWe got through the weigh-in, set\nup on our bench, and set about\nchanging the speed controller. With\nan hour or so of good teamwork, we\nhad the IC back together and ready\nto test... and would you believe it, it\nworked just fine.\nAfter a free lunch and more\nstanding around, it was nearly our\nturn to fight. We did a brief pre-fight\ninterview with Phillippa Forester,\nthen queued up to go into the arena\nalong with the other three robots we\nwere up against.\nThen came our turn to go up into\nthe control pods, above a live audience and a noisy arena complete\nwith hazards aplenty and baying\nhouse robots.\nIf you want to find out what happened after that, then why not\nwatch BBC2, Friday 6th December,\n18:45.\nAlso, look out for the Infernal\nContraption in Robot Wars Extreme:\nUniversity Challenge, due to air\nsome time next year.\nJonathan Pillai\nwww.un l of l. lc.a cuk/ orchestra\nSymphony Orchestra\nConductor: Richard Dickins\nRachmamnov\nby i rip non yi Walton _\nUBIIOConcerto\nCello: Raphael Wallfisch\n\u2022* imperial\ncollege\nunion \"\nFriday 6th December 8pm Great Hall\nrickets\n\u00a32.50 / \u00a36.50 in advance\n\u00a33.00 / \u00a37.00 on door\nAvailable from Ainslee Rutledge\nBlyth Music and Arts Centre\nsport.felix@ic.ac.uk All match and event reports are welcome.\n\n"

Well\nthis site should lower my blood pressure\n(something better had or I am headed for a major heart failure) because there are quite a few books on here that other students have finished with.\nI know that there are are already at least five\nstudents in Imperial who know of this place\nbecause they are trying to sell books - unfortunately not the ones I want, but hey, I 'll let you\noff. Obviously this site can only get better the\nmore people who use it so go and register and\nsell off those unwanted textbooks.

Just\nthink all that money wasted on text books\ncould now be put to proper use in the nearest\npub.\nRegistering is really easy, you can make a list\nof textbooks that you want and they will inform\nyou when someone wants to sell it.

So say goodbye to Waterstones, au\nUseless useful knowledge Ok, I have a confession to make, I was a little\nswayed by the really funky jump thing that the\nlogo does on this site, but it is a pretty good\nsite all the same. This web site does the obvious, provides lots of really cool quizzes. There\nare enough puzzles here to entertain even the\nmost intelligent person for hours. For the less\nintelligent (like myself) they provide the\nanswers as well.\nThere are 17 categories of quizzes and 8\ntypes of puzzle each with loads of riddles,\ncon und ra and brain teasers to occupy your\ntime.\nHowever, I'm afraid I must apologise for\npicking another time waster site, because I don't know about you but I don't have vast\namounts of time to waste. The only annoying\nthing about this site is the adverts but I sur-vive d, even though it really is one of my pet\nhates, so I'm sure you will.\nMost certainly the weirdest thing about this\nsite is the silly survey, tell me, which is greasier Lenny or Squiggy? Yeah that's what I thought, must be an American thing. Some of\nthe scientific explanations may leave a little to\nbe desired (like an explanation), for example,\nthe very simplified definition for electricity is \"it\nis so basic, that it defies explanation, and is\nMother Nature's way of saying \"Because I said\nso!\". Now I don't know much about electricity\nbut I'm not sure that \"because I said so\" is a valid explanation, my mother tried that one for\nyears and I didn't believe it when I was five.\n1\njea sr.# \u00bb\nAhhh, no oo, don't eat me, I don't taste nice,\nI taste of pickled onions and mango chutney\nQuick stop website http://www.bm a. org.uk/ap.nsf/Content/LIBOur\nAll ActionWebcam\nBe amazed, be wowed by the fantastic, brilliant all action webcam at the BMA library.\nYes, my friends, the BMA has dragged it's library up to date with the technological revolution by setting up a web cam and broadcasting it over the internet.

I 've managed to wrest editorial control\nfrom the indomitable Liz for a week!\nWhatever stories she's been giving you as reasons for my absence are all lies - I 've been\nlocked in a stationary cupboard in the Felix\noffices for a fortnight, living on a diet of staples and HB pencils while Ms Biggs has ridden roughshod over the Film pages. The cad.\nAnyhoo, we are entering the long-dark\nteatime of the movie year at the moment.\nLittle worthwhile seeing that we haven't already reviewed, hence the dearth of first-class material that you're all used to. But do\nwe let a little problem like that stop us? Hell\nno! I 've spent a pleasant weekend trawling\nthrough a pile of DVD's and have chosen\nsome choice numbers to tear to shreds as\nwell as one to praise above all. So sit back\nand enjoy another issue - and please take\nnote of two things - one, the IC Cinema all\nnight er is nearly upon us and they are showing some first class material and two, they're\nshowing Donnie Darko and 28 Days Later\nback to back on the 12th December so do\nyourselves a favour and get tickets!

The gain may\nbe a desirable object or entry to an exclusive\nevent.\nWhat did you do on the night of Monday\n18th? Watch the telly? Do a bit of integration?\nEat a cucumber sandwich? A group of\nSouthwell students are never going to forget\ntheir amazing night out. Thanks to a lot of luck,\ndetermination, cunning ness and sheer lying we\ndid something a bit different...we spent the\nnight at the James Bond Premiere and AfterShow Party!\nIt all started at 3pm when a group of us\ndecided to go up to the Albert Hall and start\nqueuing for the evening's events. There were\n600 seats available to the public outside, next\nto the red carpet to watch the stars arrive. After\n2 Vz very long, cold hours (including a mobile\npizza delivery - cheers Alex!) we were finally led\nround to our seats. We had a perfect view, but\nnothing could prepare us for what was about to\nhappen. Foxy from Capital FM was running a competition live on air to win the final pair of\ntickets to the premiere. Call it luck or just shouting the loudest but I won them! Legs shaking,\nphone ringing like mad from jealous people call-ing, Laura Parkinson (my lucky guest) and I made our way through security and into the\nAlbert Hall. You simply cannot believe how\nweird it was walking around the corridors seeing so many famous people. Everywhere we\nturned there was someone new to ga wp at. We\nall took to our seats, stood for the Queen and\ngot introduced to the main cast members. Now\nshowtime...believe me it's very weird being in a cinema and giving a round of applause after\nevery major scene or entrance. But it's definitely an experience worth living for! The film is\nabsolutely amazing, but more on that later....\nSo the film finished to the sound of yet more\napplause and the crowds made their way out-side. The exclusive after-show party was being\nheld across the road in Hyde Park, but I didn't Flying Vanquish...\nhave any tickets. Bugger. I met up with some\nfriends and took to hassling anyone remotely\nimportant looking for any spare tickets. I even\nhad a quick chat with Richard E Grant to little\navail. Suddenly a press team appeared, and we\ntried befriending them, again with little success.\nBy now we were freezing cold and about to give\nup and go home. But then the press team re-appeared, their work done. In a very charitable\nmood, they gave us their press passes and told\nus to act like we worked for the Daily Mail...\n3 minutes later, Simon Hooks, Laura Griffiths\nand I( Laura P couldn't come in 'cos she looked\nlike a scruff!) had made it through the outer\ngates to the press area, then onwards to the\nmain party marquee. The first security guard\nnodded a greeting, and then... stuck. The security team on the door was only allowing people\nin with tickets. We didn't have any. I tried flashing my premiere tickets but they weren't having\nany of it. I persisted - I'd got this far and I was-n't going to leave easily. Spinning some elaborate story about how some mystery security\nguard had taken our tickets, I kept lying through\nmy teeth. A senior door person was called over\nand a small debate ensued. After a while she\nlooked me in the eye as if to call my bluff, her\nlook saying \"I think you're a lying little monkey,\"\nthen she calmly said \"That's fine,\" and let us\nthrough.\nUnbelievable! We were in the James Bond\nAfter-Show party! The party was *amazing*!\nThe whole place was decorated like the ice\npalace in the film, with ice sculptures, water-falls, laser effects and an indescribable atmosphere. We swan ned around the place drinking\nBollinger all night, with the occasional Vodka\nMartini, shaken not stirred of course, all compliments of the house!\nThroughout the night we mingled with, chatted to, photographed and stared in awe at the\nfamous people around us. We met the brilliant\nJudi Dench, the absolutely gorgeous Rosamund\nPike, the evil Toby Stephens, the legendary\nRoger Moore, the stunning Katy Hill, the very\ntall Darius and beefy Ross Kemp to name but a few. Unfortunately Halle Berry and Pierce\nBrosnan left just as we arrived as they had to jet\noff to the USA premiere.\nSo what about the film then? Well the Bond\nphenomenon is quite bizarre... if a restaurant\nserved only one, single meal, then the customers probably wouldn't come back. But\nsomehow with Bond this works.... Perhaps it's because the recipe calls for: dozens of shiny\ngadgets, beautiful cars, even more beautiful\nladies, a bad guy with a penchant for sharing\nhis plans long before they're implemented &\nkilling his enemies in long drawn methods with\nplenty of escape paths, and a dash of the the\nmost suave secret agent ever.\nDie Another Die is a great film that doesn't fiddle with the standard Bond theme too much.\nThere are some new ingredients; we get to see\nBond actually losing for once, amazing ice car\nchases and fight scenes, so the film is definitely entertaining. My only complaints are a few\ndod gy special effects, the sheer number of bad\npuns and the fact that the bad guy's henchmen\nstill can't shoot straight...\nKing of The Blag (well done sir!)\nLoads of Imperial students tried to b lag their\nway in that night, some got escorted off by\npolice (no names mentioned!), but only we\nwere successful! So there you have it ladies and\ngentlemen, a new record has been set for the\nbest b lag of the year. I challenge you to beat it.\nThink you can? Then let us know... Keep an eye\nin Felix for updates....\nDan Wilson\nfilm.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX MUSIC REVIEWS Released and Deleted 3CR In recent times, music fans have\ncome across an odd craze by their\nbeloved bands. To wit: A deluge of\nsingle releases by the likes of The\nVines, White Stripes, Datsuns,\nGarbage and Electric Soft Parade\nthat have been 'Released and\ndeleted on the same day;' which\nhas baffled many fans who have\nasked 'What's the difference\nbetween this and 'limited edition'\nsingles?'\nThe difference is that the record\ncompanies themselves specify\nhow many limited edition singles\nare printed (For example:3,000\ncopies) and once they've sold out,\nthen there are no more copies.\nWith deleted on the same day sin-g les, it's up to the record shops to\nplace a pre-order on however\nmany copies they want to stock,\nup until the day of release when\nthey will no longer be able to order\nany more.\nThis means that the onus is on\nthe record shops to decide how\nwell the single will sell and the\nusual record shop ethos is not to\ndisappoint the customer and so, in\naccordance with normal practice,\nthey will over-stock the single to\nmake sure they don't sell out too\nquickly. This has the result of the\nsingle acquiring more shelf space\nthen it may have done otherwise,\nwhich will lead to further purchases by casual music buyers.\nIt will also result in fans who\nmay already have the album (or\nintend to purchase it) to buy the\nsingle because of the collector's value. Once a piece of music no\nlonger becomes available, it\nmeans that the copies that have\nbeen bought will go up in value,\nleaving the buyers with a colle c tor's item in their mitts: It would\nappear that this has as much to do\nwith psychology as actually liking\nthe music, since these releases\noften fetch up to \u00a310 on websites.\nAs with any marketing ploy,\nthere are downsides. As great as\nThe Music's debut album is, some\nfans would argue that if you stuck\nall the tracks from their 4 EPs onto\none CD, then you'd have en even\nbetter one. However, new converts\nto the band will not be able to\nmake their own judgement, since\nall of them have been deleted,\nleaving them having to try and pay\nhighly for copies from the shops,\nor make do with grubby recordings\nfrom the internet.\nHowever, the big question for\nthe bands is: Does this tactic actually work? The answer would\nappear to be, it depends who you\nare. All of the above acts charted\nin the 20s, with their singles,\nwhich is probably what they would\nhave expected anyway.\nAlthough The Manics got to #1,\nit has to be said that they would\nhave probably done so anyway\nwith a single that wasn't going to\nbe on an album and so would be\nthe fans' only chance of hearing it\n(Until the Greatest Hits album,\nnat ch). Although Doves and BDB\nhave both benefited, it could be\nargued that another factor was the\nmain cause of their success: -Price. (Admittedly, both were also\nsongs of the highest class)\nBoth went on sale at \u00a31 as\nopposed to \u00a32-3. ESP were baffled\nwhen 'Silent To The Dark' went in\nat #23 priced at \u00a31 but the fol-low-up at \u00a33 scraped in at #39.\nMore serious music fans tend to\nshun singles in favour of albums\nbecause they are cheaper when\ncompared with the amount you\npay for each track. You would\nthink that if all singles were \u00a31\nthen there would be no problem,\nbut actually the record companies\ngenerally lose money when releasing singles due to the cost of promotion for very little profits on\neach single. The main point of singles is to promote the album that\nthey're from, which is a bigger\nmoney-spinner for all concerned.\nHowever, fans are already beginning to wear thin of this ruse. The\nlatest ploy coming into effect is the\none-week only release. Both Turin\nBrakes and U2 and doing this with\nsingle and album respectively, but\nthis would appear to be pretty ineffective if you're trying to increase\nyour audience as it means new\nfans won't be able to hear their\nmaterial.\nIt looks like until singles become\npermanently cheaper, the charts\nwill continue to be as rotten as\never.\nDeepesh\nMatthew Get Down to Talk...\nThrough the power of the inter-net, lead singer Brian McSweeney\ntook some time out to fill us in.\n'I chose the name Matthew\nbecause I wanted a person's name. I think it gives the band\nand the music a more personal\nfeel.'\nI would classify our music as\n'passionate, honest rock music'.\nPaul Kolderie, Radiohead's producer for 'The Bends' was\namazing to work with. He pushed\nus and brought things out in us\nthat were special I think. I grew\nup listening to everything - Duran\nDuran, Madonna, gospel music,\nNeil Diamond, Aha, Julian\nLennon...\nMy favourite album so far of\nthis year is the new Sigur Ros. It\njust came out on the 28th, and\nit's amazing.\nOther than that - Massive\nAttack, 'Mezzanine' never leaves\nmy stereo.\nBoth small gigs and festivals\nare great fun to play, as long as\nwe can connect with the people\nthere.\nI agree with the banning of the\ncrowd surfing in Britain - its shit.\nIt's not what the music is about.\nGo to a show to listen to music;\ntake out physical aggression\nsomewhere else.\nAs far as the age restriction, if\nyou mean a restriction on who\ngets in to the show I think that's shit too.\nI'm still going to be going to\ndoing loud shows when I'm75. MATTHEW'S debut album,\n\"Everybody Down\" is out now on\nRykodisc. Keira\n(continued from Page 20)\nIf you're not U2 or Mariah\nCarey, you haven't got a chance.\"\nThe apathy of today's youth\nis on the minds of 3CR as talk\nturns to world events since\nSeptember 11th. Obviously not\nfans of America taking over the\nworld \"Bush scares me. His\neyes are too close together,\"\nVuckovic later confesses, they\nseem frustrated with the\nnation's attitude towards current affairs: \"People are more\nbothered with their own lives.\nThey'd rather look through OK\nmagazine and be like, \"Oo,\nthere's Robbie Williams.\"\nPeople just don't care.\nAlthough 3CR blatantly do care,\nthey have other worries on their\nplate; the writing and recording\nof their latest album being one\nof them. However, it would\nseem they don't have to go\nthrough it alone with some\nunusual friends offering their\nhelp. As the discussion of the\nlatest Manics revival arises,\nVuckovic cleverly lets their\nacquaintance slip. \"Actually his\n(James Dean Bradfield's) guitar is at my house for the\nmoment,\" he smiles, \"just\nwhile we record this album.\"\nAlways nice to have friends in\nhigh places.\np SINGLE OF THE WEEK - |\nI The Streets - Don't Mug -|\nI Yourself\nDescribed by Mike Skinner\nas ' the l airiest track on the\nalbum', 'Don't Mug Yourself\nwas recorded after a drunken night out. Over catchy\nbass beats, Mike Skinner\nemcees about the discussion between him and his\nmates over what to do\nabout a girl.

Happy\nguitar riffs, happy drumming,\nhappy bass-lines, happy every-thing.\nTechnically, I shouldn't like this\nalbum; I find myself distracted by\na beautiful melody, or an engulfing harmony. I don't mind \"Astro\nGirl\"s,' A strange experience is\nstarting, between her molecules\nand me', simply because I'm lost\nin the strings, being propelled\nalong by a bouncy bass riff.\nThe songs presented here are\nnot for the noisy complainers of\nindie; nor are they for the happy\nclapp y pre-pubescent pop mar-ket. I'd like to bet that your mum\nwould like these songs, but I wouldn't start to throw derogatory acronyms -such as AOR and\nMOR - at them just yet.\nHarmonic, melodic, slightly\nembarrassing, and engulfing.\nMatt\nFoo Fighters\nOne By One\n5/5\nMusic Felix's resident domina-trix presents to you, the mighty\nFoo Fighters!\nThree albums down the line,\nlambasted heavily for the last\none's mellowed, passionless,\nnon-Foo sentiments, the most\nfamous rock star in the world,\nDave Grohl, and his merry men\ndecided that things were going\nto get better.\nWorking with the heavier\nQOTSA, and drumming for\nDavid Bowie, helped him to\ngain the passion and vitality the\nFoos once had, they got things\nright, and have come back bigger and bolder than ever before!\nAt some point in his absurdly\nbusy 2002, Dave Grohl managed to record his fourth album\nwith the Foos. Twice. When the\nfirst effort was deemed too\nglossy, Grohl bunked off on tour\nwith the marvellous Queens\nand, on his return, bashed off\n'One By One' Take Two in dou-ble-quick time.\nIt shows, in the best possible\nways. 'One By One' is a rawer,\ngristlier album than any Foos\nouting since their debut. The\ncompelling pop hooks (three per\nsong, on average), FM accessibility, and head banging potential\nare all present. But Grohl and\nhis three cohorts deliver them in\na punchier, frequently darker\nstyle.\nThere are love songs, in the\nmain, but on the likes of 'Low'\nhe endows them with a moodier,\nmore oppressive edge. It's hard\nto imagine the Queens beating\nGrohl's inherent niceness out of\nhim, but they've certainly taught\nhim how to rough up his edges.\nThe listener is still drenched in\nmelody while listening to the\nFoos record, and rightly, I hope,\nthis won't change. Even with the\nsnarling lead track, 'All My Life'\nthere is tune held within every\ngrowling holler. You still have to\nsing along to it all. The vocals\non 'Have It AN' there is a long-ing; a pleading in his voice that\nseems refreshing because it's genuine. Then in 'Times Like\nThese' the vocal are less sung\nand seem sharper and more\ndirect. Class! Sajini\nSingles\nYoung Heart Attack - Tommy\nShots\nImagine if \"Tell Me More\" (that\nannoying tune from Grease: The\nMusical (Argh!)) were sung by a seventies glam metal band,\nwith Noddy from Slade as the\nmale vocalist. Now decide\nwhether that's good, novel, feelgood or annoying. You can certainly twist to it.\nThis is kinda cool seventies\nretro - ie. nothing like The\nStrokes or The Libertines. It's pretty fast paced and doesn't let\nup for the duration of the cd. I have no idea what the blok e is\nsinging (cf. Noddy from Slade),\nbut he wears me out; it's something about drugs, I think.\nSo, if you're in a good mood,\nand you like grated vocals, and\n20th Century Boy, this cd'll\npump you full of energy and\ndrag you up onto your feet. If\nyou listen to it more that once\n(on consecutive occasions), or if\nyou're in a bad mood, you'll\nprobably scream, \"Shut the\nf**k up!\" at your stereo, before\ntaking some deep breaths to\ncalm you down.\nExhausting, in some sort of\nway.\n3/5 Matt\nAmerie (featuring Ludacris)Why Don't We Fall In Love\nOK, so I was highly sceptical\nwhen the editor passed me this\nsingle and asked me to review it\n- not my cup of tea, thought I. The track starts with a 'gangsta\ncrap' intra but actually pans out\nto be a pleasure to listen to.\nAmerie has a stunning voice,\nthe melodies in this song are\npleasant to the ear and, aside\nfrom Ludacris's attempt at input\ninto this single, it makes for\nvery nice music. Worth a listen\nas I think Amerie does this song\nproud. Shame about Ludacris\nthough...\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk 'Earth to Matilda'\n\n"

This shall come in the form of...\nsomething that I am yet to think of. But give it time, I am sure\nit will come. So, look out for something more interesting than\nwatching mold grow next week.\nElsewhere, with just one month to go before Christmas, we\ncan start looking forward to a better new year. Hopefully, everyone should start spending lots and lots of money that they don't have, lifting the economy out of its gloom. This way, I should\ntime. Now, assume for a second that the U.N. weapon inspectors' trip to\nIraq was all in vain, and Iraq doesn't really have any weapons at all, so\nthere are no more 'uncertainties'. Then keep your eyes on the performance guidance for the coming year given by big companies in\nDecember. Finally, dump all your cash into the companies whose\nreport doesn't contain the words 'profit warning', 'earnings\nslashed', 'cost cut' or 'head count'. A year from now, you will be\nthanking me.\nWith my future career and your money taken care of then, let's stop getting the avalanche of rejection letters from employers Artist impression of shift our attention back to the glamorous job waiting to be done\nafter employers. So, if we could all do our bit, and actually buy economic recovery here. Attention, fellow aspiring writers! Following the deluge of\nsomething expensive for your parents this Christmas, I will be response from my plea for business writers last week, I now only\njust fine. have 3 openings left. Rumour about promises of fame and fortune attached\nPerhaps if you have twenty or so grand to spare, then here's an idea. The with the job is unfounded, not to mention the hefty remuneration package,\nrecent rally in the U.S and U.K stock markets looks as if it will hold up this So, write in now before it is too late.\nThis week in the City....\nSainsburys, the supermarket chain has\nannounced plan to expand into non-food products to match the sales growth enjoyed by Tesco\nand Asda. Sainsburys will from now on man-a fact ure its own homewares, cook wares, clothing and child products. This would get rid of its\npartnership with man a fact ur ers that have produced its non-food products for the past 2 years.\nMoody's Investors Serviced] have warned that\nbanks are likely to continue to pursue aggressive\ncost cutting in Europe, which roughly translates\nto laying off more workers. As the equity and\ndebt underwriting[2] market continues to suffer\nshrinking demand, major banks are li k ley to size\ndown their operations. The worse hit banks are\nthe likes of JP Morgan Chase, CSFB, Deutsche\nBank, Drsdner and Commerzbank. Only UBS\nand Citigroup are well placed to withstand the\ncontinued slump in the debt and equity market\nto avoid further job cuts, err... I mean cost cut-ting.\nThe Mill, Britain's pioneer\nand only Oscar winner in\nspecial effects (for\nGladiator) is to pull out of\nfilms and concentrate on\nadvertising. This would\nleave Britain with no special\neffect house to rival those of\nHollywood. The Mill cited\nthat the film industry was\nfar too volatile and the\ninvestment and time needed\nto do films was preventing it from becoming the\nleader in advertising that it strives to be. The\nMill's portfolio includes both Harry Potter films\nto date and advertisements like Vodafone,\nGuinness & Levi's. MM02, the former mobile phone arm of BT\ngroup had held merger talks with Dutch\nEnd of the road\nWorld Domination\nContinues\ntelecommunications operator KPN over a merger of their respective German operations, it\nemerged. However, talks had stalled when\nMM02 insisted that they were just joking after\nall. Analysts are worried that MM02 are getting\nthe idea that they can now hold their own down\nin Germany after finally reporting a post ive cash\nflow[3].\nCoffee Rebuplic is to\nsell 13 of its sites for\n\u00a32m to Starbucks,\ndespite a late \u00a310m indicative cash bid\nfor Coffee Republic\nfrom Nero's Cafe.\nNero's bid would\nhave given Coffee\nRepublic shareholders 3p per share, but\nthe board rejected\nthe offer on the grounds that it 'under vau led' the\ntrue value of Coffee Republic. Considering Coffee\nRepublic's stock climbed a whopping lp to the\ndizzy height of 2.75p, maybe \u00a310m was a bit\ncheap.\nLVMH Moet Hennesy Louis Vuitton, possibly the\nlongest company name in the world, is filing a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley\nallegedly had a conflict of interest in its research\nof LVHM, the world's largest luxury goods group.\nAccording to LVMH, the research was biased\nbecause of Morgan Stanley's long standing relationship with their rival Gucci.
