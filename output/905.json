    "content": "NUS\nAbandoned\nAston University is to d is affiliate from the\nNational Union of Students (NUS), it was\ndecided at a Union meeting earlier this\nmonth. The result of the meeting, which\ntook place on the 2nd May, was ratified\nby a Council meeting, and is now going\nahead.\nYork University Students' Union (YUSU)\nsubmitted a similar motion to their Union\nMeeting, but this was not passed in its\noriginal form. Instead, it was altered to\nread that a decision should be taken to\nre affiliate every three years. If this is not\npassed then York University will\nautomatically d is affiliate from the NUS.\nThe decision to remain affiliated for the\nnext three years was also taken. The\nopinion of the meeting was that it was\nbetter to stay in the NUS and reform it\nform inside, than to leave at this time.\nCampus\nCannabis\nA rather unusual motion was passed at\nYork University last week. The motion\nstated that, amongst other things, the\nUnion believed that Cannabis was\ncheaper and less harmful than either\nalcohol, or tobacco.\nThe motion therefore proposed that\ntheir Internal Vice President launch 'an\nawareness campaign about the\nadvantages of cannabis'. The external VP\nto 'look into the Legalise Cannabis\ncampaign' and the Deputy President to\nprovide a report on the possibilities of\nselling cannabis through the Union shop.\nThe President commented that although\nthe proposal had been passed by 'a large\nmajority', it would probably not be\nimp li men ted due to 'a small problem' of\nlaw.\nThe President in turn was mandated to\nwrite informing the York University's Vice-chancellor of the advantages of 'Sex\n(with a condom), Drugs, and Rock and\nRoll.' He informed Felix that Union\nmeetings were generally well attended\nwith quo rate meetings occur ing about\ntwice a term assuring us that they dealt\nwith more serious matters too.\nGhandi\nKilled\nRagivaratna Ghandi, Prime Minister of\nIndia, was killed in an assassination last\nTuesday. Born on the 20th August 1944,\nhe received his school education in India,\nbut came to England to go to University.\nWhile at Trinity College, Cambridge, he\nmet his wife to be, Sonia Maino, who he\nmarried before coming to Imperial\nCollege.\nAt IC, in 1965, he started an\nUndergraduate course in Mechanical\nEngineering. During his year of study, his\nmother Indira, was elected Prime Minister\nand, after taking his exams, he withdrew\nfrom his course. It is not known whether\nthis was the reason for his withdrawing.\nProfessor Williams, of the Mechanical\nEngineering department, is arranging for\na member of the department to go the\nIndian High Commission, in India House,\nto sign a book of condole ment. Jazzy\nWinner\nBruce Hall, a Physics Second Year, was\nthe recipient of \u00a310,000 last week, when\nhe won a competition on Jazz FM.\nAlthough Felix was unable to contact\nhim, we have been informed that he is\ncurrently unsure what to do with the\nmoney (I 've got a few ideas-News Ed),\nbut has stated that he intends to 'put it in\nthe bank and decide later.'\nAppeal\nNext Tuesday evening, the 28th May,\nthere will be a meeting in Linstead Hall\nto discuss the large rent rises for the next\nacademic year along with other proposals\nfor the Hall. The meeting will occur after\ndinner. All Linstead residents/Ex-Linsteadians are strongly urged to attend,\nPaul Shanley, ICU President has the facts.\nBar Manager\nAlso next Tuesday, Mr Andrew Flanagen\nwill become Imperial College Union Bars\nManager. Previously Goldsmith's College\nStudents Union Bar Manager, his\nappointment follows the resignation of\nJohn Riding just over one month ago.\nJohn has successfully obtained the licence\nof the Flounder & Firkin pub, Islington, a venture in which we wish him luck.\nIce Cream\nQueen's Tower snack bar will soon be\nsupplying 'an enormous range of high\nquality ice creams', according to Mr\nSimon Westerman, IC Refectories\nManager. Hopefully commencing on the\n4th June, QT will stock Loseley ice cream\nproducts along with other brand names.\nWatch out for the special promotions\nwhich will accompany the launch.\nCrime\nThe total value of money and valuables\nfrom the five thefts in Southside Halls of\nResidence, last Thursday, was between\n\u00a3300 and \u00a3400. Efforts to obtain a visual\ndescription of any suspicious individuals\namounted to nothing and has led College\nAuthorities to conclude that an outsider\nwas probably responsible.\nA wallet, left inside a jacket pocket,\nwas stolen from the seventh level of the\nHuxley building. A male Afro-caribbean,\nfive foot eight inches tall, wearing a black\npadded boiler-suit and baseball hat, is\nsuspected of the crime. A similar\ndescription was given in connection with\na theft from the Management School the\nweek before.\nApology\nFelix would like to apologise for an error\non the news pages last week in the\narticle about Imperial Colleges gas\nsuppliers.

    "content": "Editorial\nF Bit\nOkay, so we've all got exams this\nterm. For some they're the last ones that\nthey'll ever take at this wonderful little\ncollege of ours. For some they are just\nthe beginning, and all the fun and\nsplendour of finals are a mere glimmer\non the horizon two or three years hence.\nBut the main point is: For some they are\nalready over, and for some they are still\na fair way off, and Felix needs more\ninput!\nEven at the best of times it can be a bit\nof an uphill struggle to get enough\nmaterial together to produce a decent\nissue. In a college of over 6000 students\nwe continually seem to have to rely on\nabout a dozen regular people for most of\nour stuff. This really sucks. I know about\nthe exams: Unlike a normal Felix editor\nI'm a non-sabbatical, and I 've got exams\nthis term as well. But no one has them\nnon stop for the whole term, and a lot of\nyou guys and gals have finished now.\nEverybody finds it easy to tell me that\nFelix hasn't seemed to have much in it\nthis term. Why don't some of you try and\nsee how easy it is to give us a hand?\nAnd while we're on the subject...\nWhy on earth does IC (along with most\nother universities, etc) still use the most\narchaic exam system ever? Someday\nsomeone will explain this to me. Or at\nleast I hope so, because I can't work it\nout.\nAll that the current style of exams\nreally test is the ability of a student to\nmemo rise an often huge amount of\ninformation, and churn it out in a vaguely\nreadable form. That, and the speed of\ntheir handwriting, and their ability to deal\nwith short term stress. It's ridiculous. The\nrelationship between a students actual\nability at the subject and their exam\nmark is minimise d. As is the relationship\nbetween a students ability to work\nconsistently and usefully. I have several\nfriends who have done virtually no work\nfor an entire year, spend about two\nweeks revising like mad and doing all the\npast papers three times, and then end up\nwith 70-90% marks!\nI'm not trying to say that they should\nfail, but surely there are two main uses\nfor a degree: To gain a higher level job\nin a business unrelated to the subject, or\nto gain some form of employment\ninvolved with the subject studied.\nIn the first case the degree should\nrepresent the ability of the graduate to\nwork consistently with a high level of\npersonal motivation and independence;\nadapt to different or new situations and\nproduce results to deadlines, etc.\nIn the second case the degree should\nrepresent all of the above, and show that\nthe graduate actually has a good\nunderstanding of the subject and it's basic\nconcepts, as well as representing a high\nlevel of ability in it.\nLet's face it: The majority of our\ndegrees are gained by our exam marks,\nand the type of exams we have don't really represent any of the above very\nwell (if at all). Consequently, people who\nhave a high ability in the subject, and\nwork hard all the. time, but aren't good at\nexams (for whatever reason) don't achieve the degree that they should. In\nmost of the exams I 've taken, someone\nwith no knowledge or understanding of\nBiology, and a photographic memory,\ncould at least have passed, and might\nhave done very well!\nIt's about time this was changed. Just\nhaving a high level of education in a subject is useless if the means by which\nthe subject is tested don't actually\nmeasure what they should.\nThe majority, if not all, of exams should\nbe 'open book', so you can take your\nnotes and/or textbooks in with you: The\nability to organise personal material, and\nquickly find information when necessary\nis a very important skill, and becoming\nmore important all the time. Also, 'open\nbook' exams judge your ability to, for\nexample, use a formula correctly, not\nyour ability to remember it in the first\nplace. Which do you think gives a better\nrepresentation of your understanding of a subject?\nIt has been stated in various studies on\nexaminations that multiple-choice papers\ngive a far better portrayal of a students\nability than traditional written papers. But\nhow many university exams have\nmultiple-choice papers? Why not ??!!\nThey're even easy to mark!\nIn addition to the exams themselves,\nthere should be a greater amount of in-course assessment, instead of the odd\npractical, essay, or problem sheet, and\nthis should be give more weighting in the\nfinal marking. Not only would this\nincrease the importance placed on\nconsistent work, but it would also\nencourage interaction between students\nand academic staff, as more students\nwould seek the help of their lecturers\nwith the work.\nBut then, I'm sure there's a very good\nreason why I'm wrong. It's just that I can't find anybody to explain it to me.\nGood luck in the exams, everybody.\nMaybe someday they'll actually reflect the\nreasons why we're here.\nStaff Meeting:\nMonday l pm.

Classes consist of\napproximately 35 people and are held in\nthe Imperial College sports centre\nswimming pool. Hand paddles are used to\ncreate more resistance in the water and a pulse check is taken at the start of the\nclass (resting pulse) and again 35 minutes\nthrough the class (working pulse). The\nclass consists of wall exercises: stretching,\nswimming, running and the cost to\nImperial College students is \u00a31.50 (non-students S2).\nThis type of exercise is designed for\noverall fitness and is becoming\nincreasingly popular with top athletes.\nSign up NOW in the Sports Centre for\nyour first class.\nSailing Club\nFor the first time in several years (if\never!) IC received an invitation to this\nyears World Dinghy Team Racing\nChampionship - otherwise known as The\nWilson Trophy. The event takes place\nannually at Kirby Sailing Club on the\nWirral, and this year it was held on the\n10th12 th May. The trophy is always\nearnestly contested for in the Firefly\ndinghies, with entrants this year from\nEire and the USA as well as the best of\nthe British teams.\nDue to exam stress we were short on\nnumbers, but with the help of an IC old\nboy and a couple of IC sailors, we\nmanaged to reach Cheshire with a full\nteam of 6. (It should be mentioned that\nthe UL team had not been invited and\nwere feeling somewhat miffed!)\nArriving in good time on the Friday\nnight, we recovered from the journey and\nthen sorted out our ac como dati on. All 32\nteams present were put up in local\nhouseholds, and contrary to the norm of\nsleeping bags on the floor, we all were\ngiven beds in which to get some sleep.\nThis was a good thing as sleeping time\nwas scarce with a7.45 am Captains\nbre if ing on the Saturday Morning!\nKick off was at 8.30 and our first race\nwas against a familiar United Hospitals\nteam. (Did we really go all that way just\nto sail against them ?) After the first lap\nwe were in a winning combination, but\nthen the af fore mentioned old boy seemed\nstrangely attracted to one of the markers,\nand couldn't get off it again! We managed\nto hold first place (well done Liam!) but\nlost overall after some good team racing.\nNext on the agenda was Cambridge.\nDespite their fast reputation, we managed\nto make their 3rd helms bad day even\nworse by adding 5 penalty points to their\nscore. This clinched us victory. The final\nteam in our league was USYRU - the\nStates national team. A very jam my move\nby one of their boats gave them a1,2,3 over the start, and they held it for the\nrest of the race.\nTo decide the one qua lifer from each\nleague, the teams sailed each other twice.\nSOCS\nUSYRU convincingly beat everybody in\nall the races, and so went through to the\nquarter finals.\nSunday saw some very exciting sailing\nbetween the league qualifiers, with the\nbonus that the Marine lake at West Kirby\nhas an excellent grandstand viewing\nposition where we could observe how it\nshould be done!London rivalry aside, we\nwere pleased to see the ex UL\n\"Castaways\" do well.\nA plate race for non-qualifiers was run\nas a flat race with one boat from each\nteam. Henry & Liam were determined to\ndo well. They seemed to be the only boat\nto find a completely calm patch after the\nstart, and we thought that all was lost.\nAmazingly though, they picked up a gust,\nstormed back into the race, and were not\nlast over the line... the first time around.\nThe experience of the other boats proved\ntoo much for them to overcome, but their\nroll-tackling improved throughout the\nrace, and they got a cheer as they cross\nthe line.\n\"At the end of the weekend, we had to\nacknowledge being beaten in the league,\nbeing beaten in the plate race and even\nbeaten in the boat race on the Saturday\nnight! But we were THERE at The\nWilson, and we returned southwards\nsunburnt, tired and beaten but happy!\nWe hope to return next year and, who\nknows, we might even improve by then!\nFELIX\nneeds\nFEATURES!\nwhich means that you have\ngot to write them!\nSo if you're bored with\nrevision\nGET WRITING!\n\n"

    "content": "Mermaids\nWhy are there so many films\naround at the moment that feature\nwomen who are modelled after\nBoadicea with a hangover ? Stroppy,\ninsensitive and blunt, they roam around\ncelluloid under the guise of being\nliberated. And why does Cher play so\nmany of them ?\nThankfully, although this film does\nboast a 'strong' (read 'boringly obvious')\nwoman, she doesn't stride around the\nplace being admired for being a bitch.\nMermaids actually charts the development\nof Cher and her entourage from itinerant\nragamuffins (okay, not quite) into a nice\nstable family unit. Again, not quite.\nMrs. Flax (Cher) is a roaming and\nheavily unreliable mother with two\ndaughters of differing parentage. She\nspends most of her time getting laid and\nleaving small towns in an uproar. Her\ndaughters are a ten-year old with a penchant for aqueous exploits and\nCharlotte, fifteen, with a burning desire\nfor nun hood. Nunhood. There's a word\nthat isn't used enough. A bit like\n'spelunking'.\nComplications arise when Mrs. Flax falls\nfor the unlikely but likeable figure of Lou\n(Bob Hoskins) and Charlotte (played by\nthe wonderful Winona Ryder, objectivity\nbe damned) topples with a heavy thud for\na gentleman named Joe with a dark past\nand a lifetime of repentance. Bob\ndiscovers that Cher is more possessive\nthan ..erm.. a very possessive thing\nindeed.resenting his close relationship\nwith her daughters. Charlotte, having had\nall the sex education of an eunuch in a nunnery (and much the same frustrated\noutlook on life as one), is convinced that\nto kiss is to conceive.\nThis all goes on for quite a while,\nwhich is a bit of a drag, until a bit of\ntension rears its ugly head; Bob gets a tad pissed off and Charlotte goes\nspelunking. Actually, that's not strictly\ntrue. She runs off in her mother's car.\nWhich is nearly the same.\nAll is eventually resolved more or less\nhappily (rather more than less) via the\nobligatory Tragedy That Brings The\nFamily Together and ends with a song\nand dance routine that reminds me with\nimmense force of the Muppet Show in\none of its less bizarre moments.\nCher is annoying but competent and\nmore secondary than the film than the\nads would have you believe; Ryder and\nHoskins between them probably carry the\nbest scenes in the movie in fumbling\nseduction and family forbearance. Ac liche movie that does them well enough\nfor you not to care. It also has one good\nsong. No, not that one.\nThe Flying Gerbil\nThese Foolish Things\nI Originally named as Daddy\nNostalgia, the scriptwriter, Colo\nTavernier O 'Hagan, wrote the story\nmainly about her parents. It was directed\nby Bertrand Tavernier (Around Midnight)\nin a reflective and contemplative mood,\nas a tribute to his own father. But even\nactress Jane Birkin played the part of the\nscreenwriter daughter of Caroline as if,\nshe was in a real family. This is why the\nfilm is so real. One can feel he has heard\nsome dialogues somewhere before. (I have!)\nOf course, the film won't be that good\nwithout the help of a strong cast. Other\nthan Miss Birkin, Odette Laure as French\nwife Miche, who tries to express her love\nto her husband by over protecting him\nand keeping him on a strict diet but is\nrepulsed, is excellent. But the star of the\nfilm is still Daddy, played by Dirk\nBogarde (after a twelve year absence on\nscreen since Despair). Since Daddy hates\nthe strict lifestyle he has to carry on after\na serious operation, Caroline helps him to\nfind his way back to his favourite cafes\nand places. Through their conversations,\nCaroline begins to know her father more\nbecause as a child, her parents are\nalways engaged in Bourgeois social\nevents. She also feels Daddy's dislike of\nbeing old and fear of death, even though\nDaddy tries to conceal. Although Caroline\nhas to go back to Paris for work and her\nown family, the family relationship has\nbeen strengthened a lot. However, Daddy\ndoesn't find his strength to wait for her\nnext visit one week after she has left\nthem.\nOne special thing about the film is the\nthird person narrator telling the story\nother than the actors. Instead of an\nending that could have made the\naudience searching for their Kleenex,\nwe've got the narrator mentioning\nDaddy's death and Caroline's feelings as\nshe strolls along the street weeping. This\ncan be due to Tavernier's intention of\nmaking the film light and natural, but yet\none can feel his love for the characters.\nThe film, which was shot in the\npicturesque spots of the South of France,\nstands miles ahead of other cheap soppy\ndramas. These Foolish Things may not\nmake you cry, but it will certainly make\nyou reminisce.\nDJS Su.\n5\n\n"

    "content": "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\nAre Dead\nI From the mind of Tom Stoppard,\nwriter of 'The Real Inspector\nHound' and screenplay script er, comes a bag of fervent ideas to amuse\nand tease. This play, first shown at the\nOld Vic in 1967, displays all his wit and\nintellect, and brought him many an\naward in Britain and America.\nBased on and around Hamlet, the film\nfollows the forced adventures of two of\nhis servants, Rosencrantz and\nGuildenstern, summoned by Royal\nCommand to the court of Denmark.\nHamlet's father has been killed by his\nbrother, who jumped quickly onto the\nthrone and into marriage with the Queen.\nIt appears that this has addled Hamlet's brain and is causing great concern to the\nRoyal Court. Rosencrantz and\nGuildenstern are brought in to look into\nhis problems and find a solution.\nTim Roth and Gary Oldman make an\nexquisite duo as the servants who are\nalways verbally sparring and playing\ngames with each other. Beautiful ideas\nare brought forth way ahead of their\nhistorical time in a way that seems so\nwonderfully obvious. The discovery of\nsteam turbines, paper aircraft and\nexecutive toys makes one think; why did\nit take so long to reveal their practical\nsignificance?\nThough set perfectly as a costume\ndrama, the opening bluesy guitar riffs and\nthe first scenes remind you of a classic\nwestern. Tales told within tales by The\nPlayer (Richard Dreyfuss) make a mockery of the servants' view of life and\nPrayer of the Rollerboys\nThis may well be the best Sci-Fi\n\u2022 roller skate action movie of the\nyear, but only just. It tells of how\nafter America has crumbled under the\ndebts left by credit frenzy (overdraft city)\na group of adolescent fascist drug dealers\n(on roller skates) try to rebuild the great\nUS. The cops want to stop these narcotic\ntradesmen/boys and to this end intend\ngetting Griffin (Corey Haim, the one from\nthe Lost Boys) to infiltrate. Add the pretty\nyoung love interest in the shapely shape\nof Casey (Patricia Arquette, the one from\nNightmare on Elm Street Three), a little\nbrother (in the shape of a gnome on acid)\nMiltie (Devin Clark, the one from bugger\nall) and an inevitable childhood friendship\nbetween Griffin and Gary Lee\n(Christopher Collet, the main b addy from\nPrayer of the Rollerboys).\nOf course, the Rollerboys, who\nresemble the Brady Bunch on bad acid,\nwind up getting involved with Griffin's life. In order to save the old folks home\nwhich he loves Griffin and Casey have to\nform a roller disco championship team\nand win the prize money.\nThat's not what happens but it would\nhave been a better movie. Okay, it\nwouldn't, but close. What does happen is\nthat the appallingly bandanna'ed Griffin\n(think Axl Rose with less (!) taste)\ninfiltrates the Rollerboys despite his\ncomplete lack of acting ability and takes\nthem out from the inside. Joining the\nRollerboys (apart from its fascist and\ndrug frenzy problem) could well be the\nbest thing Griffin does all movie; they\ntake away his bandanna and shoot it,\ngive him some cool shades and give him\na reason to get off with Casey.\nAll this said and buried, it's not as bad\nas it sounds. It is bad, but not as bad as it\nsounds. Most of the acting is dreadful and\nthe roller skates are practically subliminal\n(more of a tribute to Leo Sayer) but there\nis definitely a masochistic charm that\nkeeps you watching (Oh to be thirteen\nand tasteless). It beats washing tramps.\nThe Amazing Flying Gerbil Machine\nThe Flying Gerbil would like to make it\nclear that he dissociates himself from the\nfinal two lines of this .review. Vagabonds\nto the Felix office please.\nprovide more intrigue than Tinker, Tailor,\nSoldier, Spy. Bouncing from balcony\nscene to balcony scene reduces Romeo\nand Juliette to a french farce.\nIn short it is a film not to be missed at\nany cost, a cinematic creation far too\nlong in the coming that shouldn't be\nallowed to fade away. And just remember\n'Death is for Kings, Princes, and\nnobodies.'.\nChrist\nWhen What Where\nRosencrantz And\nGuildenstern Are\nDead\nPrayer Of The\nRollerboys\nMermaids\nThese Foolish\nThings\nCurzon WE,\nCannon\nChelsea\nDo you really\nwant to know?\nOdeon Leicester\nSquare\nCurzon Mayfair\nRecommended:\nFlatliners + ReAnimator + Dead\nRingers + Altered Scala\nStates + Pentonville\nHalloween 2 (all night er) \u2014Film\n4\n\n"

    "content": "In the wake of the recent storm. The Rector gives his answer to\nthe question\nThe College Day\u2014Why Change?\nThe College day currently extends from\n9.30am to 5.30pm. It has done so since\ntime immemorial. So why change? The\nneed to do so arises from a number of\ndifferent circumstances:\n1. The increase in the number of students\nThe number of students has increased by\n24% in the course of the last decade. The\nnumber of lecture theatres and rooms has\nremained constant. So, with minor\nexceptions, has the provision of teaching\nlaboratories.\nAre we using the facilities we have in\nan optimal manner? I am sure that we\nare not. We should, for example, stop\nthinking of lecture spaces as 'belonging'\nto particular departments. They should be\nallocated according to need\u2014by\ncomputer\u2014as has been the practice in\nmany American universities for a long\ntime. At the cost of more walking across\nthe College, this would half. Even so,\nalthough as the Universities Funding\nCouncil (UFC), by adding up all the seats,\ntells us we have more than enough\nlecture provision, in practice there are\nvery real difficulties in finding suitable\nteaching spaces.\nThat problem becomes worse-when we\nare concerned with specialist teaching\nclassrooms\u2014such as those equipped for\ncomputer aided teaching. And, of course,\nlaboratories can hardly be swapped\nbetween different disciplines.\n2. The increase in the variety and\ncomplexity of course structures.\nThe accretion of new knowledge in most\nsciences and engineering, proceeds at a devastating ly fast pace. The wrong way\nto deal with this is to cram more into\ncourses\u2014the sentiment shared by all\nmembers of the College. But one must\nprovide opportunity for students to make\ncontact with what is new. This suggests\ncourses which no longer insist on a single\npath to salvation, but provide choices,\ncertainly in the later years of a course,\nand where possible, also in the earlier\nyears. I believe that most of our\ncolleagues\u2014student and staff\u2014welcome\nsuch developments. Once again it imposes\nnew pressures on the timetable.\n3. The difficulty of preserving slots for\nhumanities and language teaching\nWhen the timetable squeeze is on, the\ntemptation to reduce the opportunity for\nhumanities and language teaching is\nstrong and in some cases has proved to\nbe overwhelming. Yet this part of our\nacademic programme is growing more\nrapidly than any other\u2014particularly\nlanguage teaching. This is of course a direct result of the perception that Europe\nis for real; specifically it bears on the\nemergence of a number of four-year\ncourses with one year to be spent outside\nthe UK. Reasonable proficiency in a language is vital, not just to make best\nuse of academic opportunities, but to\nallow a fully integrated life in another\nsociety. It is probable that the demand for\nlanguage teaching will continue to\nincrease, both in total number and in the\nrange of languages covered.\n4. The continuing financial squeeze by\ngovernment on the university system\nJust over a decade ago the student staff\nratio at Imperial College was under 7; it\nis now approaching 12. The reduced level\nof funding is evident in just about all we\ndo. It is particularly apparent when we\nembark on capital projects. So, for\nexample, we are about to turn the first\nsod for Chemistry II. It will be a splendid\nnew laboratory\u2014but significantly smaller\nthan the clearly identified needs of the\nchemists. In the original design it included\nnew lecture spaces. The UFC flatly\nrefused to allow us to' include these. The\npressure on us to make more use of the\nresources we have is evident.\nAnother example: we have a number of\nclassrooms equipped for computer aided\nteaching. We would like more. The\nrecognition that there are some things\nwhich are better illustrated on a screen,\nmanipulated by the student, than chalk\nand talk, is growing. These facilities are\nexpensive. The capital equipment grant\nthat we recieve is under enormous\npressure. Yet one has to admit that these\ncomputer equipped lecture theatres are\nnot used very many hours a year. A modest extension of the usage would ease\nthe timetabling problem very\nconsiderably.\n5. The desire to introduce joint honours\ncourses\nSome students know precisely what they\nwant to do\u2014their aspirations match what\nindividual departments have to offer.\nOthers are attracted by a menu which\ndraws on offerings from two departments.\nWe have examples of such joint honours\ncourses right now, eg between Computing\nand EE, between Chemistry and\nManagement. There is evidence that\nthere is a demand for more such courses.\nWe are currently making a preliminary\ninvestigation of the possibility of joint\nhonours courses with our neighbours\u2014the\nRoyal College of Music. We know that\nthere are a lot of students who have\nfound it difficult to decide between a degree in science/engineering and going\nto the RCM.\nOne can plan such options\u2014but the\nproblem in adding anything new to our\nfabric is, inevitably, the additional\ndifficulties of timetabling which it implies.\nThe Working Party who have looked at\nthe possibility of extending the College\nDay have made some tentative\nrecommendations. They are presented in\nthe adjacent box. Adopting these\nproposals would provide some very\nhelpful additional breathing space in the\ntimetable.\nSo why don't we do it? There are\ndifficulties of perception, as well as_ objective difficulties to be overcome. The\nWorking Party listed a number of these\u2014\nnot all of equal weight. I do not, for\nexample, believe that there is a danger of\nincreasing the number of lectures per\ncourse. All the pressures\u2014students,\nundergraduate studies committee,\nindividual academics\u2014are working in the\nopposite direction. There are no\nsignificant increases in costs. I do not\nbelieve that staff will object to a very\nminor element of flex i time in working\nhours\u2014all indications are that this is\nwelcomed.\nBut there are real problems:\n1. A particular choice of options could\nlead to an excessive number of lectures\non one day\u2014very sparse timetabling on\nthe next. One is exhausting; the other\nnon-optimum use of time.\n2. If there is to be a staggered lunch hour\n(ie timetabling permitting lectures in some\ndepartments 12-l pm and in others l2 pm) it will stop some students participating in\nmeetings of clubs and societies.\n3. Domestic difficulties: eg making\nbreakfast in some University Halls and a9 am class; dinner following a5 pm lecture;\"difficulty for staff and students\nhaving responsibility for children.\nThese represent a real additional burden.\nHowever it is important to see these\nproblems in a quantitative a \u00bb well as\nqualitative manner. Not all departments\nwill need both the early and the late slot.\nIt is very unlikely that an individual\nstudent, or an individual member of staff,\nwill have many 9am classes. It is unlikely\nthat a student will have many lunch time\nclashes between classes and societies.\nAnd after all, just occasionally, one can\nskip a class\u2014get a friend to take some\nnotes. Going to lectures is much to be\ndesired\u2014but one can make just a few\nexceptions. It has been done before....\nThe proposal is not grossly out of line\nwith what happens elsewhere in the\nUniversity. UCL 'normal' hours are 9am to 5pm, but there are classes that start at\n8.30am, and others that go on to 6pm. RHBNC runs from 9am to 5pm \u2014but they\nare considering an extension of these\nhours. QMW runs from 9am to 5pm, but\nwith some classes going on to 6pm. All\nAmerican universities that I have\nencountered start at 8am. The need for the proposed extension of\nour 'normal' hours is real.\nEric A Ash.\n\n"

    "content": "A CUBS Easter Dive Trip\nWe arrived at Porthstock beach, in the\nLizard, and the novices attempted their\nfirst tentative dives from the beach. The\nfollowing day we ended up at Porthkeris\nbeach after a brief tour of the local area,\ninvolving a number of \" U\" turns and\nseveral revisits to particularly interesting\nroad junctions.\nThe large rollers were breaking nicely\non the rocks so we decided against\nlaunching the boat in the surf. After\nseveral phone calls to find out what had\nhappened to our dive boat, which we had\nhired, we found out it had turned back\nand would meet us around by Mullion.\nOur inflatable was then unpacked,\nlaunched and used to ferry the first lot\nout to the hired boat.\nThe surf was still quite big and there\nwere several unorthodox bits of boat-handling during the day, including surfing\nbackwards onto the beach and filling the\nboat up with water etc.\nDuring the week we mainly used the\nhired boat, launched from Falmouth, as it\nwas too rough for out inflatable. Even in\nthe hired boat it was still quite rough and\nthe fish saw a number of breakfasts\nmaking a special re-appearance over the\nside.\nAt the end of an enjoyable week of\ndiving, the annual awards were handed\nout roughly as follows:\nBest quote: \"This looks fairly serious Rolf\"\nuttered Rudi, as the boat was about to be\nswamped completely by a large wave.\nHighest \"Faff\" factor (time wasted\npreparing for a dive and longest dive\ntime): Cambridge dive club.\nBest dive shop customer (ie lost most\ngear): Hime.\nMost Unorthodox Boat-handler: Steve\n(hire boat skipper) for tearing off while\nstill tethered to the back of another boat.\nJanshed Sethna award for stunt driving:\nSarah-Jane (for a180 degree spin on the\nway down).\nCoke Cola fi z award for decompression\ndiving: Colin and Rhoda.\nUAU Cricket\nIC 2 nd vs City Sunday19 th May Imperial won by three wickets\nGoing into this last group match Imperial\nhad to win to go through. City won the\ntoss and decided to bat, a big mistake it\nturned out. Imperial fielded excellently\nbefore lunch with City 79-7 by the break.\nWe let them get away after lunch, but by\nthe end of City's innings they had made\n165 for 9 wickets. Both Rup Banerjee and\nPaul Lewis were fined heavily after the\nmatch for jug avoidance, getting 4\nwickets each for IC.\nCity's innings was punctuated by two\nhotly contested run outs, where City's spor st man ship was found sadly lacking.\nOn both occasions their batsmen were\ngiven out but the IC captain nobly, if\nnaively called them back. So City can be\nthought lucky that they made as many\nruns as they did. Had Imperial\nconsequently lost, the chances of the\ncaptain being lynched by the rest of the\nteam were considered extremely high.\nHowever justice was done. Gunni\nDhadyalla scoring a quick fire38, Runil\nVitarana an assured and confident 60 and\nPete Sharpe a remarkable 32 were chiefly\nresponsible for IC getting the runs well\ninside the allotted number of overs. Pete\nSharpes innings was especially\nnoteworthy since he hadn't played for\nover a year and was only asked to play\non the morning of the match when IC\nwere a man short.\nThe 2nd XI now expect an away match\nagainst Exeter to be played very shortly.\nPlease check the noticeboard regularly.\n\n"

They provide a more than\nadequate soundtrack to your own\nmini view of the world. The rain, the\nspeckled lights and the darkness move to\nform a Bladerunner-like setting. The\nvocals are phased just the wrong side of\nintelligible and combine with eerie breaks\nand estranged samples, including one\nwhich sounds like someone gargling in\nslow-motion as they drown, to make you\nfeel uneasy and start walking faster.\nJust when you needed it least, you\nhave an acid flashback and panic.
