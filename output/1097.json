    "content": "10 COLUMNS 7 November 1997\nTrouble at mill, lad. The\nEMU saga rumbles on,\nthough the mood and pretext for debate appears to have\nchanged slightly. As time goes by,\nthe feeling seems to be 'when'\nrather than 'if. This is all very well,\nsince it removes an element of\nconfusion, but it also serves to stifle debate on the fundamentals of\nthe project. If the British public are\nconstantly told that the key question is timing, they will soften their\nopposition to the single currency,\ndeprived of the relevant in form a tion. Labour's affirmation of uncertainty is driven by the belief that\nthey would not win a referendum\nbefore the next election, and has\nlittle to do with economic consid-e rations. The Conservatives have\nruled out membership for 10 years\nin the hope that it will given them\na quiet life for the time being. Of\ncourse, this is a forlorn hope, with\nrampant Europhiles like Peter\nTemple-Morris in the party. The\nreal question is whether it is a good idea in principle- will it ever\nwork? By delaying decisions, we\nare left not knowing whether that\ndecision has really been made.\nThis is naturally not an easy thing\nto resolve. Support and opp osi tion, despite what young Mr Blair\ntries to tell us, cut across party\nlines. It is certainly true that the\nayes are in the ascend ance, principally because of the difficulty of\nopposing the\nNew Labour spin\nblitz. Eurosceptics\nare seen as jingoistic lunatics,\nsomewhere in the\nsocial order\nbetween child\nmolesters and\nImperial College's student journal-is ts. To argue\nconvincingly against EMU does\nnot require\nrecourse to the issue of sovereignty and Her Majesty's image on our\ncoins and banknotes, very important though they are. The vital\npoint about EMU is the loss of\ncontrol of interest rates and the\ninevitability of a common fiscal\nbalance sheet for Europe. The\nremoval of currency exchange is\nnot the clinching argument. If you\nbelieve in monetarism as both\nLabour and the Conservatives\nseem to, the loss of interest rate\ncontrol by a country or its central\nbank is economic and political sui-cide. Nobody has convinced me\notherwise and I doubt they ever\nwill.\nVery distressing news\nhas just reached\nme. Many of you\nyoungsters may\nnot be familiar\nwith the Holland\nClub in Sherfield.\nNothing to do\nwith clogs,\nf \u2014^ mind. This is the\nnon academic staff social club, providing good\nfood at very reasonable prices. As\na post grad,I can choose between\nthere and the SCR. I have not\neaten in the SCR for 18 months. All\nin all, this is a very successful ven-ture. Hence my fearful disbelief\nwhen 1 heard that College Catering\nwish to get their filthy paws on it. 1\nknow of no surer, quicker way to\nscrew it up than by absorbing it\ninto this cost-unconscious, over-staffed, overcharging department.\nMoreover, it beggars belief that\nplans are afoot to expand Catering\nat precisely the time they should\nbe looking to rational is e and privat is e the existing set-up. This is a recipe for disaster, if you'll excuse\nthe pun.\nFinally, I 'll slip into Anne\nRobinson mode for a minute (no\nsniggering at the back). Now is the\ntime when Christmas parties are\nbeing planned and restaurants\nbeing booked. My own recent\nexperience suggest that Da\nMario's on Gloucester Road\nshould be avoided, on account of\ntheir tendency to cancel bookings\nif bigger and better parties arrive\non the scene, claiming a double\nbooking.

    "content": "NEWS 7 November 1997\nVPs in the Spotlight\nStudents of ICSM had their first\nchance to put forward their views\nto the new ruling elite of the medical school hierarchy during the\nVice-Principals Question Time last\nMonday. The session took place at\nSt Mary's Hospital and was chaired\nby Professor Michael Whitehouse,\nVice-Principal for Undergraduate Studies. Also in\nattendance were Dr Malcom\nGreen, Vice-Principal for\nPostgraduate Studies,\nProfessor Rory Shaw, Director\nof Medical Education Unit,\nand the Deputy Secretary of\nICSM. Notable for his absence\nwas Dean Professor John\nCaldwell, who was away in\nJapan.\nOne of the principal concerns of the medical students\npresent was the availability of\nhouse jobs for in a lists under\nthe matching scheme.\nCompared to St Mary's, the\nformer Charing Cross and\nWestminster Medical School\nprovides fewer pre-registration\nhouse jobs. This has led clinical\nstudents from St Mary's to worry\nthat competition for such posts\nwould intensify in the foreseeable\nfuture. In response to this, Dr\nGreen assured them only Mary's graduates would be eligible to\napply for positions at Mary's for the\nnext few years.\nIt was established during the\nquestion time that most people\nthought it fair to have separate\ngraduation ceremonies for the\nMBBS and BSc graduates. One suggestion was to graduate qualified\nschool was also discussed.\nStudents were informed that the\ncollege did not object to the medical school having their own logo so\nlong as it was not in the form of a shield, as this would turn it into a coat of arms - heraldic regulations\nonly permit Imperial College to\non d year clinical s from St Mary's that they would not be given a room in hall when they become\nfinalists next year, especially when\nthey return from their electives.\nMany of the penultimate-year students present believed that they\nhad been guaranteed final year\naccommodation when\nthey enrolled. However,\nProfessor Shaw claimed\nthat they had only been\npromised 'priority'. No\none present was able to\nclarify whether postgraduates from other disciplines would be given priority over final year\nmedics in Wilson House.\nOverall, no firm commitments were made by\nthe Vice-Principals. This\nwas in considerable contrast to last year's session\nwhere many promises\nFrom left to right: Dr Malcom Green (VP for Postgraduate Studies), Prof Rory Shaw' were made, and are not\n(Director of Medical Education Unit), Prof Michael Whitehouse (VP for likely to be kept.\nUndergraduate Studies), Katie Armstrong (President of ICSMU) and the Deputy A suggestion to hold\nSecretary of ICSM.

    "content": "22\nBUBBLE GUM\nQUAKE II\nid Software\nThree weeks ago possibly one\nof the most important events\nin the computer gamers'\ndiary passed without a whimper\nfrom the press. The Quake2 beta\nwas posted on ID Software's( the\ndarlings of the games industry) web\nsite and was quickly mirrored\naround the world. After a suitable\nperiod of time to deliberate, cogitate and digest on this latest offer-ing, the Quake community now\nspeaks.\nWolfenstein, iD's first successful game, almost single-handed\nopened up a new genre of computer gaming. The 3d1 st-person view\ngave a much greater feeling of freedom and the not so politically correct humour made for a fresh and\nexciting game. ID then ^\nfollowed up by the legendary Doom which \u00ab\n\u2022\nshifted the setting from\na Nazi Castle to a futuristic base,\ndropped in a load of\ngenuinely scary nas ties and gave you a meaty\narsenal of weapons to\ndestroy them with.\nWhat really kept Doom\n(And all it's sequels on\nvarious platforms)\ngoing was the ability to\n'Deathmatch', to play against other\npeople and, as anyone who has\nmore than a passing nod with mul-GAMES\nti player games knows, it is so much\nmore satisfying to blow up someone living hundreds of miles away\nwho you've never met, or even bet-ter, your friends. What also added\nto it's longevity was the fact that\nanyone with the inclination could\ncreate their own levels thus ensuring that iD could focus their attention to their next project rather than\ndiverting precious resources to\nproviding support for the existing\nuser base.\nWhen it was released, Quake\ninspired a new generation of fan at ics, not least because of the\nenhanced multiplayer facility but\nalso because, in addition to being\nable to create your own levels you\ncould also completely change the\nsource code allowing programmers\nto add extra weapons and change\nthe rules of the Game.\nDespite it's commercial success, Quake did draw criticism for\nWhen Quake2 was started iD\nsupremo, Jon Romero became fed\nup with this policy and left to form\nIon Storm.\nQuake 2 improves on Quake in\nmany ways, at least on paper. The\nmonsters are more detailed and\nnot having a plot. There was a short\nstory posted explaining your\nmotives but basically the premise\nwas, run, shoot, kill, solve puzzles.\nbetter animated. They are also\nsmarter and provide a more genuine challenge as opposed to the\n'pump as much lead into it before it\nkills you' mentality of the original.\nThe cosmetics have been\nimproved; there are more colours\non screen and the water is transparent on all computers not just\nthose running OpenGL graphics\ncards and there is dynamic,\ncoloured lighting. There is also a story line of sorts, mostly seen by\nviewing animated cut-scenes\nthrough a window, and to aid this\nthe levels have been designed to\nrepresent buildings rather than\nlabyrinths where the only objective\nwas to get from A to B alive.\nOn the down side the game is\n7 November 1997\nslower, at least on low end\nmachines, not only because the\ngraphics engine has been beefed\nup but also because iD have taken\nthe controversial step of op timi sing the routines for high-end PCs rather\nthan those with more modest systems. Modifications\nwill also be more difficult since the old,\neasy QuakeC has\nbeen replaced by the\nmore powerful and\nflexible but ultimately\nmore difficult to program DLLs (Dynamic\n| Linked Libraries).\nThe general reaction has been mixed.\n| People have complained that it is too\nDuke Nukem-esque\n(Quake's main rival).\nOthers have countered that this\nwas only a comp at ability test, not\nmeant to represent the final prod-uc t, others have said that it has nowhere near the amount of \"WOW\"\nfactor that the original did. The\ndebate will continue to rage until\nthe final version is released and\nprobably way on past that.\nWhichever way though you can\nmake up your own mind by downloading it from:\nwww. id software. com\nIf you'd like things a little faster\nthen try getting it from one of the\nmirrors sites on Sunsite in the\nDepartment of Computing. \u2022\nSimon\n9' Wfed'V;;s Bitmap Brothers\nZ is one of those games that\nyou're going to love or\nyou're going to hate it. At\nfirst sight I personally hated it, but\nafter experiencing 3 hours of solid\n'battle', I loved it. The story line\nbehind this game is a straightforward one: you are the commander\nof an robot army, and the objective\nis to kick the crap out of the enemy\nand eventually destroy your\nenemy's main fortification. During\nthe process of 'ass kicking', you\nhave to capture pieces of territory,\nin which are factories. These factories can make more robots and\nother goodies such as guns, tanks,\netc.\nAt the beginning of each level\nthe game play is pretty tense\n:\n;\n-:\n.\n.\n'\n.\nv,'j l!j,:. v. Lkor 1\nill i$|' \u2022 \u2022\nV K, \u2022\nV K, \u2022\nthough eases off a little after you\nhave a sufficient number of robots\nand military vehicles to defend\nyourself. The key to success in 'Z' seems to be having the correct\nweapons and troops at the correct\nposition and at the right time. Since\nboth robots and vehicles can only\nmove at an incredible slow rate,\nyou could find yourself having a dozen or two robots being blown to\nbits before your light infantry can\nrescue you from losing your entire\nrobot army.\nIn general the game is quite\neasy to play: it doesn't take long to\nget the hang of the controls even\nwithout using the manual (the manual is quite thin and not that\nwordy). The snap shots between\nlevels are quite cool and fun to look\nat, however there are few variants.\n'Z' also has a large sense of\nhumour: within the game when you\nare about to lose the battle, the\ncommentator of the game would\nsay 'you are crap', 'you are hope-less' just to give your morale a boast.\nIf I have to make a comparison\nbetween this game other strategy\ngames, 1 would say other strategy\ngames such as 'Red Alert', 'Counter\nStrike' are the legends (just like Star\nTrek Next Generation) and Z would\nbe a spin-off of such a strategy\ngame (similar to Star Trek Deep\nSpace Nine!!!). It is definitely worth\nthinking of buying but 1 wouldn't place your hopes too high. O Ivan Chan\n\n"

    "content": "7 November 1997\nNON FICTION\nBOOKS 19\nECSTASY RECONSIDERED\nNicholas Saunders * * * *\nIt's two years to the day since I reviewed Nicholas Saunders'\nEcstasy and the Dance Culture.\nSince then it has found favour in\nmany camps - c lubbers, writers,\nparents and the police. Its clear,\nunpretentious and well-informed\nstyle has led to it becoming the\necstasy bible and there's hardly a drug-hoover I know that doesn't have a copy wedged between On\nthe Road and Dougal and the Blue\nCat on their shelf.\nSo what new material does\nSaunders have to offer? The structure of the book is largely\nunchanged, but with new sections\non risks, death and safety.\nHowever, the most significant\naddition is a greatly expanded look\nat the limited scientific evidence\navailable. The toxicity of MDMA is\nclosely examined, both on a systemic and neurotoxic level. The\nbeneficial effects of combination\nwith fen flu ra mine and fluoxetine\n(Prozac) are considered.\nSummaries are provided for the\nnon-scientific reader, and the\nwhole book is intensively referenced - the bibliography contains\njust about everything that has been\nwritten on the subject. Saunders\nhas also updated the book extensively, taking into account new\nlaws, new music and many new\npersonal accounts.\ntar y information are used extensively, allowing the reader to\nchoose how deeply to investigate.\nThere are contributions from many\nIf I 've made Ecstasy authors and an extremely wide\nOne of the best things about this book is that is pays for pill tests.\nThe results, like these, are distributed as widely as possible without\ngetting knee-capped.\nReconsidered sound like a text\nbook, don't be put off.

For\nme he's a bit of both, 1 give the\nman 'nuff respect for being the\nbiggest black star of this generation but does he have to released\nthis weak arse, pop-ta stick, just\nfor the masses bullshit. Well yes\nactually because he earns him\nmo' money and guess what he's doing it again with the release of\nhis latest single fu st Crusin' on\nNovember 17th this'!! be another\nhuge commercial success, but\nprobably won't be getting any\nserious club play. Havin' said all\nof that Will's new album is soon\nto drop with production by some\nof the largest hip hop names\nPuffy, Trackmasters, Jermaine\nDupri and Warren C, so what's up? Maybe he just is tha man!\nY 'all can all make your own minds\nup. -Stop Press\u2014 Just in that Will\nis signed up to play Muhammad\nAli in a film of the boxers' life. So\nit seems Mr Smith does fly like a butterfly (weak shit) but stings\nlike a bee (tha good shit).\nFor all of y 'all who are straight\nup West Coast till I die, there's some light at the end of the tun-nel. For a time Death Row lay\nstagnant; the loss of Dr Dre and\nTupac's death along with the\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nA complete anthology of\nBritish pop history, this CD. is the Ben-Hur of all albums.\nEmbracing musical styles as diverse\nas traditional aboriginal and psychedelic rock, these twelve tracks\nfeature ten covers ranging from\nmodern day to way back into the\nearly sixties. It is indeed an album\nof great sophistication and virtuosity, the triumph of modern music.\nOkay, that's rubbish! But then\nagain it's by Rolf Harris and he\nplays the wobble board on it, so\nwhat other reason can you possibly need to buy it? It is the ultimate kitsch album ever, and is a definite must to anyone who thinks\nthey're hip or has a sense of\nhumour. Rolf Harris has to be the\nmost loved tit ever to have existed.\nPerhaps it is the fact that he never\nstops smiling, or the way he manages to talk to everyone as if\nthey're six years old that does it.\nWhy do people still like him? How\nlong has he been around? And\nexactly how much acid does the\nman use?\nimprisonment of Suge 'Baseball\nBat' Knight was just too much to\nbear. But they're back and\ncrush in' all before them. Just out\nstateside is Death Rows Gang\nRelated - The Soundtrack and its\ngone straight in at number one\nover there. The film is the final\nbig screen appearance of 2Pac,a shame really 'cause he was showing some real talent in this direction (just check Poetic Justice\nand even Gridlock'd). The LP is\nfull of killer tunes, a couple of\nreally dope tracks from the man\nhimself (RIP) along with support\nfrom Snoop, Kurupt, Nate Dogg\nand Mack 10.\nStaying on the West Coast the\nheir to the Tupac throne has still\nnot been decided, Snoop is the\nfrontrunner with most people\nbelieving that his next joint will\nwrap it up. He had better be\nquick though because my\nsources, on the other side of the\nAtlantic, say that the long awaited joint from Ice Cube is going to\nfast track tha man to the number\none spot on the West Coast. The\ndouble LP is titled War & Peace\nand should drop in the near\nfuture; more details when I get\ndem.\nBack to the present day and\nNone the less, this album does\nindeed dabble into a bit of every-thing, and Rolfs rendition of Alanis\nMorrisettes's One hand in my\npocket is truly brilliant. Fit with giggling vocals, neat ambient sound\neffects and even a sneaky little lyrical twist, the track is a true classic,\nbound to crack you up. Another\nfavourite of mine is A girl like you\n(yes, the one by Edwyn Collins)\nwhich features Rolf on those brilliant vocal effects that sound as if\nhe's playing with himself and a solo\non the jaws harp that could have\ncome straight off Jimi Hendrix's Strat. In fact, 1 was very impressed\nwith Rolf's musical capabilities, (if\nyou can believe what the sleeve\nsays about the number of instruments he plays on the album).\nAs if all that isn't enough for\nyour money, there's even a version\nof Lou Reed's Perfect Day, So go\non, go out and buy the album, and\nif you don't like it, you can always\ngive it to your kid brother. CI\nMarc\nas per usual it's my job to go\nthrough the mountains of crap\nthat the record companies\nrelease and bring for h the real\ngems. Tha first ladies of hip-hop\nbring us a monster track entitled\nRU Ready, if this doesn't get you\nsingin along go home. Changing\nFaces have at last got round to\nreleasing / Got Somebody Else\nthis mid tempo track doesn't give\nanything new but it sticks in your\nhead and for dat is worth check-ing. Another monster doing the\nrounds at the mint ue on US is\nYou Should Be Mine by Brain\nMcknight with rap by Bad Boy\nMase, this is better than good it's a fucking eight ball single.\nSpeaking of Mase, this Bad Boy is\ndropping his a blum soon, it\nseems that Puffy has decided to\nflow the market with Faith and\nthe Lox also dropping theirs in\nthe near future. Tha Bomb simple\nas tat, Mr WooHa brings\nDangerous the second release\nfrom the LP When Disaster\nStrikes both show be on your\nchecklist, will blow up on the\ndance floor.\n'Nuff from me, remember to\ncheck the column next week. Love\nto all, n Milen\nNORTHERN*\\ UPROAR Yesterday, Tomorrow,\nToday * * *\nT here's not really much to be\nsaid about this album. In\nfact, there's about eleven\ntwelfths less to say about this\nalbum, than most twelve trackers.\nWhy? Because this is essentially\none track - one forty minute track.\nYep, you did read correctly, this is\nonly a forty minute CD and, for ate nner, this isn't quite enough.\nYesterday Tomorrow Today, is\nnot ground breaking, revolutionary\nor specialised in any way, but it is\nsomething that will no doubt sell\nby the bucket-load.\nStyle-wise, think of Ash and...\nno, on second thoughts, just think\nof Ash. Tempo, lyrics and guitars\ncould all have been lifted straight\nfrom Ash's recording studio, and\nplaced onto this CD. While this is\nno bad thing, as with Ash, if you've\nheard one song, you've heard\nthem all. This is perfect back gro ud music, something to fall asleep to.\nAnd that's it. Ther seems to be a dist ince lack of energy about the\nwhole thing.\nEverything you'd expect from\nthe current phase of band music is\nhere but, as I 've already said, nothing really distinguishes any track\nfrom any other. In fact, they could\nall quite easily fit into the background of many an Aussie tea-time\nsoap, a fate that is becoming more\nprevalent among British bands.\nYesterday Tomorrow Today is\nvery much middle of the road BritPop, but good middle of the road\nnone the less. Unfortunately,\n'good' is the only word that can be\nused to describe just about every\nelement of the album. Nothing\nstands out for notable compliment\nor criticism.\nIf you like Ash, buy it. If you like\nNorthern Uproar, even better. If\nyou're looking for a bit of variety,\nforget it. El\nDerek\n\n"

    "content": "7 November 1997 COLUMNS\nRevenge at last. That is how many\nleft-wing Conservatives must view\nthe latest sorry developments in\nthe party, which has exposed its\nfirst major split since the move into\nOpposition. The subject is nothing\nnew - Europe. The dissidents certainly are, ex-cabinet heavyweights\nsuch as Michael Heseltine and\nKenneth Clarke have attacked the\nleadership's anti-European stance.\nThe particular subject in question is\nthe little-known Amsterdam Treaty,\nwhich the Government supports\nand is guaranteed to get into law.\nThe Tory leader, William Hague,\nintends to oppose it utterly, and\nthreatens to impose a three-line-whip (where MPs are forced to\nvote at all costs) to do so.\nTreaties are the building blocks\nof European integration, the greater\nones being the Treaty of Rome, the\nMaastricht Treaty and so on.\nAmsterdam is not quite as significant as these, but is still an important piece in the European puzzle.\nIt is precisely the sort of bone of\ncontention that neatly divides the\nTories - to Labour's delight. In the\nleadership election held in the\nwake of the General Election defeat\nin May, the two eventual can di dates, Kenneth Clarke (represent-ing the left wing) and William\nHague (representing the right)\nstood.. An immediate 'Anyone but\nClarke' campaign including such\ngrandees as Margaret Thatcher her-self, and triumphal is m on their part\nwhen Hague won, even though he\nwas considerably junior in age and\nexperience. This created bitterness\nshould just resign now, rather than\ncontinue generating tension. This\ncould be a sensible way to show\nhe's tough without too much real\nresponse needed, since shadow\nministers will always want to keep\nan eye on their jobs. However this\npolicy could also be a mistake. If a number of ministers call his bluff\nand resign, it will create a rump of\nHamish Common\nWestminster\nEye\non the left, as they saw their own\nviews being marginal is ed in the\nparty's policy-making. The final\ningredients of the contentious\nEuropean Treaty and the sharp\ndivides on this that had been\npapered over previously, caused\nthis row to surface.\nHague has responded to the\npresent altercation with a hard-line\nview. He says that those ministers\nwho disagree with him on the issue\ncapable pro-europeans who will be\nable to oppose the leadership at\nwill in the way the 'Euro-rebels' did\nso effectively, helping in the last\nGovernment's downfall. The pro-europeans will have little problem\nin helping in Hague's. Clarke\nannounced that if the \"Shadow\nCabinet wanted to changed the\nparty policy of the last thirty years,\nit can't conceivably imagine that\npeople who've been in office for\nyears and years, taking a different view, were going\nto agree.\" On the other\nhand, Thatcher is marshalling her\nforces and speaking in the Lords,\nsupporting the leadership, and has\nalready criticised Clarke and\nHeseltine for their disloyalty\n(although what she was doing with\nJohn Major during his term of PM was hardly continuous praise).\nSo what long-term relevance\ndoes this have? The question of\nEurope bores the pants off most\npeople, its distance and irrelevance\nto us as contributing factors. Silly\nlaws and 'anti-British' decisions add\nto general despair, all in all few\npeople are positively interested in\nit. This may be fine, but to ignore\nthe issue completely is dangerous.\nThe shenanigans of our politicians\nin these affairs, especially on the\nsingle currency, will affect us considerably in the time to come. It is\nan issue few of us have the time,\nthe expertise, or the patience to\nunderstand. Let us hope our elected representatives get this one\nright for a change.\nDsDLFLTD\nChicken and Mushroom Pie\nSay one day you fancy\nroast chicken. So you buy your\nchicken, roast it (375\u00b0F,190 \u00b0C, gas mark 5, 1 hour plus 10\nminutes per lb over 21b), eat a drumstick and a piece of breast\nbut can't finish it because you\nforgot to ask some friends\nround. Then it sits in the fridge\nfor a couple of days and suddenly you panic because you\nwon't finish it before it goes\noff. Well, here's what to do\nwith the rest.\nTear all the pieces apart,\nstrip the meat from the bones\nand put it aside. Make a stock\nwith the carcass, the bones\nand skin. This involves putting\nall these bits and pieces in a pan, covering with water,\nadding pepper, salt, a couple\nof bay leaves and whole\ncloves, bringing to the boil and\nsimmering for 1 Vz hours. Then\nsieve the stock so that you are\ni eft with just the clear ish liquid.\nWhilst the stock is boiling\naway, prepare the other ingredients. Make a dough by mixing 8oz flour with 4oz fat (suet\nor butter, the former is\nextremely unhealthy and hence\nvery tasty) and a pinch of salt\nand then adding enough water\nto bind everything together\ninto a smooth paste. Putting a large pinch of mixed herbs in\nwith the flour gives extra\nflavour.\nNow cut the meat into\nsmall (1/2\") pieces, thinly slice\n1 /21b of mushrooms, dice one\nsmall turnip and one small\nparsnip into very small cubes\nand mix all these bits in a baking tray or casserole dish.\nSeason with salt, pepper,\nmixed herbs, a bit of chilli\nsource, whatever you fancy.\nWhen the stock is ready,\npour some onto the meat and\nve g so that the liquid comes\nabout half way up the mixture.\nRoll out the dough and place\non top, pressing the edges\nagainst the sides of the dish to\nseal it. Cut a small hole in the\nmiddle of the dough to stop\nthe pie exploding and making a mess of your oven. For a flashy\nfinish you can glaze the dough\nby brushing some egg white\nonto it.\nFinally cook the pie in the\noven at 400\u00b0F,200 \u00b0C, gas mark\n6 for 30-40 minutes or until\nthe crust is nicely golden.\nAntoine\n\n"

    "content": "7 November 1997\nfe? 6 LETTERS\nLetters to Felix...\nOKAY SO WE\nFORGOT TO\nPROOF A REVIEW\nDear Felix,\nI am, like many others, I think,\na regular reader of Felix, especially\nsince last year when Alex Feakes\nmade a splendid job of the whole\nthing. An equally large number of\npeople, however, enjoy denigrating\nour illustrious newspaper; strangely - perhaps someone could\nexplain this to me some time -these never seem to be people\nwho feel any inclination to contribute to it. Still, there is nothing\nwrong with honest criticism: I think\nas with all newspapers there is\nbound to be some interesting stuff,\nsome less enthralling, some well-written, some less well.\nForgive me if 1 have taken too\nlong getting to the point of my let-ter, which concerns the theatre\nreview of issue 1096 (p.21). May I offer you my heartfelt thanks for\nthe amusement this article afforded me. (It is second only to the\nstaggering \"Letter from Across the\nAtlantic\" of 3 Oct.) This case surely\ndeserves a prize for its sixteen, yes\nsixteen, misprints (three of which\nin the same sentence) - higher bid-de rs?.I was at a loss that someone\ncould find a play \"extremely flinn y[ sic]\" (on three occasions), refer to\n\"seer a ingly[ sic] endless situations\",\nand talk quite casually of \"grate f lil[ sic] respite\". I would never have\nthought such slips of the pen (I use\nthe expression tentatively) even\nremotely possible.\nMr. Matt Williams, or whoever\nthe typist was, thank you, whoever\nyou are.\nYours quite sincerely\nIannis Deschamps (Chem3)\nPS. Steady with the caffeine, lads.\nDear editor\nI have just finished reading the\ntheatre review for Closer at the\nNational Theatre written by Matt\nWilliams. 1 lost count of the spelling\nand punctuation errors in his\nreview once they reached double\nfigures. May I suggest that \"Closer\"\nproof reading is encouraged by\nyourself in future!\nSusannah Parry\nDear Felix,\n1 feel that it is about time\nsomeone addressed the issue of\nthe standard of Felix (or lack there-of). This year, Felix has began an\nintellectually terminal descent into\nwhat seems to be a bottomless pit\nof drivel. The \"news\" articles and\nfeatures are increasingly sub-stan-dard and littered with spelling mistakes (computer programs known\nas spell checkers do actually\nexist!). Try reading Matt Williams'\nrecent article from the perspective\nof a foreign student. It seems as\nthough Felix is being created by\npeople who have neither the time\nor talent to do it properly. As one\nof my friends described the last est issue (Felix #1096); \"The Sport but\nwithout the tits.\" 1 think that just\nabout sums it up. Is there such a real lack of news stories around\nCollege that it necessitates the\ninclusion of such (albeit light heart ed) shite as the \"Naan-Bread-O Meter?\" Or are you simply waiting\nfor people who \"have some news\"\nto phone you, as requested on the\nfront cover (of issue #1096)? 1\nshudder to think that Felix is managing to break last years standards\nof mediocrity. Even Simon Baker\nwas unusually tame; his reactionary\nrhetoric is one of the few things\nthat does spice up Felix (even if I do agree with it personally). Need 1\nalso mention the infamous bookstore incident? Obviously, that was\nsuch a minor story it was neglected\nfrom Felix until the College had\nmade a decision on the matter,\nleaving all students to simply\naccept what had happened.\nHowever, despite this (somewhat\nmajor) oversight, the previous Felix\nteam seemed to have at least\nestablished standards which you\nare not upholding, or are even\naware of.\nNow, you may well level the\ndisclaimer, \"if you don't like it, then\npiss off and do it yourself,\" at me.\nThis is all well and good, but I have\nnever claimed that 1 could run Felix\nunlike yourselves, who a bvi ou sly think you can (otherwise why are\nyou on the Felix team?). Please\nimprove the standards for the sake\nof the sanity of all students within\nCollege.... otherwise we'll have\nnothing to do during morning lectures on a Friday.\nRobert Emerson\nLOAD OF BALLS\nThis is about Jon Trout's article\n\"The Two jon nie s\"I wanted to thank Felix on part\nof Third World First for publishing\nJon Trout's article \"The Two\nJonnies\". This article raised issues\nwhich are very seldom heard of at\n1C, such as world poverty and the\ndamage done by TNCs (Trans\nNational Companies).\nNevertheless I found (like a few\nothers) that Jon Trout used this\narticle more as a platform for his\nimmense ego (e.g: \"The two\nJonnies\") and failed to really give\ncredit where credit was due (which\nis bad journalism). Johnny Ball was\ninvited by Third World First to give\na lecture (not just a \"meeting\") on\nOxfam. From Jon Trout's article you\ncould just about think that he invited Johnny Ball himself to have a pint! It might seem that we are trying to get into the limelight of\nJohnny Ball, but all I would have\nasked was for a little recognition,\nsuch as mentioning that TWF\norganises such talks on a regular\nbasis (every two weeks minimum),\nand perhaps a contact address?\nThe whole idea of inviting\nJohnny Ball was to get people interested in Third World issues, who\nnormally wouldn't have been, but\nwere allured by the prospect of\nseeing their childhood hero first\nhand! Anyway, we are still very\ngrateful that Jon Trout wrote this\narticle. Maybe if we get Zoe to\ncome down next time Jon Trout will\ngive us more c red!

    "content": "SPORT 7 November 1997\nRocks and eskimo rolls A fairly normal late Friday de par ture, after the usual late attendance\nof the driver and thus the trailer,\nled to a late arrival in Dartmoor,\nmostly caused by large numbers of\ntraffic cones. Finding the bunk barn\nempty of other people was a definite bonus. After a good sleep,\nbreakfast was accepted with mixed\nenthusiasm, those on their first trip\nignored the suggestions that they\nshould eat all they could, clearly\nfailing to appreciate how long it\nwould be until tea time.\nWith a little panic over how\nmany paddles we had brought\nalong, and some minor distractions\nin the form of a large trailer proclaiming 'Dagger Boats - free trials',\nwe managed to get on the river\nDart (after Garth floated his boat\ndown on its own) to spend some\ntime teaching Whitewater basics\nbefore setting off.\nAt this water level (a bit low)\nthere was little to worry anyone,\nand so we had a good first run,\nwith only one swim (previous trips\nhave netted about 10 swims in one\nworry than us, as he spent a good\nwhile upside down before rolling.\nMost problems were found in the\nshallow rocky sections, and Nicky's A canoeist eagerly rushing back for his dinner\ndescent). The few good bouncy\nrapids were well negotiated, a capsize from Dean causing him less\ntangle with a tree won't be something she wishes to repeat soon.\nQuite by accident we were\ndown in the car park and getting\nready to paddle before 10 o 'clock\n(no one noticed the clocks went\nback an hour) on Sunday.\nA little unauthorised Demo boat\nborrowing led to Garth getting into\ntrouble with the blok e in charge.\nThe day's first run was done at\nsuper speed, with no swims, and\nminimal playing around (until the\nbottom, where jumping off the\nbridge was taken up by anyone\nloony enough), leaving us plenty of\ntime for a second. Not the most |\nserious paddle ever, the Topo Duo I was wheeled out and our resident I river psychos Colin and Sam went \"\ncharging down the river, until they\nswam at Triple Falls.\nAnyone interested in joining\nplease mail us on slap per s@ ic.ac.uk, or turn up to our\nTuesday session (7pm Beit Quad).\nComing soon: Tyne Tour (7/8/9\nNovember), Polo vs ULU (2nd Nov)\nFootie sex-deities in orgy of gorgeous ness ICWAFC v RFH\nAt last a full team, with a last\nminute random (ex-foot ie Bud\n\"The Spod\") flown in from Paris\nto make up the numbers.\nTensions were running high, with\nRoyal Free being evil hussies\nfrom last year. 5 minutes into\nthe first half and Scribbler shot\nand through sheer goal keeping brilliance, the ball trickled though\nthe keeper's legs. Pressure was\nintense for the rest of the half,\nbut amazingly no more goals.\nLily and the Spod suffered facial\ninjuries but we birds are so hard\nthey carried on playing.\nThe second half saw a change of keeper, Baldrick for\nHacker Lyle and it has to be said\nthe Royal Free attacks were as\nscarce as their good looks. Wee\nMarisa, Nadia, Amy, Jo and Lili\npushed hard for the elusive second goal but it never came.\nStaunch defending at the back\nby Freud and Hedge ensured we\nstayed ahead.\nThe birds first real win to\ndate. Now to get slaughtered on\nthe Hammy Ten. Seriously,\nthough, a lot more commitment\nneeds to be shown if we are\ngoing to get any results this sea-son. But still, well done everyone!\nICWAFC 1 - 0 Royal Free\nICAFC IV v Q MW IV\nAlthough hoping for the season,s first victory, the fourth's winless\nrecord was sadly intact at the final\nwhistle. This was a game we\nshould have won, indeed it was\ndescribed as our worst ever result.\nSomewhat over the top, but it\naptly describes the passion contained within the fourth's footballing folklore, and after the game\nthe spirit was as good as ever.\nCaptain Quick unfortunately\nreceived his marching orders from\nthe over-zealous official who\npenal is ed the passionate player.\nHe was surely unfairly singled-out\nin a mass brawl at the final whistle.\nThe official thought that he had to\ntake action and the captain seems\nto have been the scape-goat.\nStuey spent the game on the side-line, and after stepping onto the\npitch one time too many bawling\ninstructions was sent by the ref to\nthe serenity of the changing rooms\nfor the pre vio u ly unheard-of crime\nof refusing to leave a football\npitch. All good fun, though.\nThe goals were scored by Ryan,\nplaying the best football of his\ncareer and Mike, coming out of\nretirement. Also, Darren \"Darren\"\nBoland in his first game since\nmarch wasn't very good.\nICAFC IV 2 -2 QMW IV\nQMW II v ICAFC II\nDespite a disgraceful pitch and aQ MW student ref, with a virtually\nunchanged squad there was a quiet confidence about our team.\nUnfortunately, just like last week,\nled to some complacency and a stupid early goal for them. The\nfirst half continued with Phil, Dan,\nJesse and Loz in defence winning\nevery header that came their way\nbut the midfield and attack failing\nto penetrate. The ref didn't seem\ntoo bad and didn't mind both\nteams kicking lumps out of each\nother.\nCaptain Dan's half-time team-talk of \"Get in the six-yard box,\nlads\" worked wonders and within\nten minutes we had scored two\nwell-worked goals calmly finished\nby Pistol Pete - not a bad debut.\nWith the defence still untroubled\nwe began to push home with the\nmidfield pushing forward - excellent work from Felix, as usual, and\nalso Steve who seems to be coming to terms with the physical\naspect of the English game.\nPatrick was fouled in the area on\none of his m azy runs but as he\ndidn't fall over the ref declined to\ngive us a penalty. Worse was to\ncome.\nQ MW equalized against the\nrun of play with a goal that 'keep-er Chris \"Scouse\" could do nothing\nabout. Their team sensed that they\ncould hold on, and so did the ref\nwith his decisions becoming more\nand more blatantly biased as the\nminutes went on. Martin was\nthrough on goal to break his four-game barren spell and was brought\nback by a ridiculous offside dec i sion. Pressure from the Q MW players and the heckling of the supporters on the sideline was obviously influencing the ref who insisted on having a linesman to give off-sides against our forwards, but not\nassigning a second in our half.\nIn this game the cheats didn't prosper, as Phil - who had been\nsuperb in defence all game - punted the ball high into their area and\nit landed just in the top corner of\nthe goal. Their defence was being\nripped apart and finally killed off\nten minutes before the end. Felix's long throw bisected their defenders and with an assured air Si put\na beautiful looping shot from over\ntheir advancing keeper. Surely the\ngoal of the season thus far.\nSo, with three wins on the\ntrot, a place in the next round of\nthe cup, injured players returning\nthis Wednesday, good team spirit\nand a spectacularly good-looking\nside, IC seconds go marching on\nto glory.\nQMW II 2 - 4 ICAFC II\n\n"

Much politic king results in a 'test case' solution - if the female\ncandidate survives the tough\ntraining, all women can take part in\nkilling on an equal opportunity\nbasis. Like I said, hardly inspiring.\nNeedless to say, the evil military\nbosses try to make Gl Jane fail,\nnone more so than her insidious\ncommander, played by an excellent\nViggo Mortensen. On cue, just to\nprove that sexist Uncle Sam isn't so\nbad, along come the Arabs (the\nsort of gun toting mullahs that live\nin Hollywood minds) to get their\nass kicked. Demi Moore's shaved\nhead isn't the only ugly thing in this\nfilm. \u2022\nSimeon Patterson\nUP ON THE\nROOF\nStarring: Nobody famous\nDirector: Ditto\nWarning! The first five minutes of this film will strike\nterror into the hearts of at\nleast half the campus. After the\nfinals exams are over, however, we\nmeet up with the five people singled out from the exam hall, and\nfind out that they are friends, some\nmore intimate than others, who\napart from wearing weird clothes\nand sporting strange hairdos, also\nshare a passion for a cappella\nsinging. Student life, it would\nappear, just has not changed. Every\nclich e is thrown in, but you still end\nup saying, \"Yeah! I know someone\njust like that!\"\nWe move from the late\nseventies to the mid-eighties, and\nfind our friends at a wedding of\none of their own. The conversation\nconcerns the usual things; \"How's the job\", \"You've lost weight\", \"You\nhaven't\", \"How can you possibly\nmarry that twerp?\". It is this last\nquestion that we are left pondering\nas we move to the mid-nineties\nand discover how the group has\nturned out.\nThe film is an adaptation of a successful stage production and\nprovides a regular supply of chuckles along the way. There are several moments of intense personal\nrelationships, but the mood is soon\nlifted by the beautiful a cappella\nmelodies. The cast are big-screen\nnewcomers, but do justice to the\ncharacters, and the fact that they\nare primarily actors who can also\nsing is a bonus, since a genuine\nsense of enthusiasm is conveyed to\nthe songs. Colourful and beautifully\nshot, this is an ideal film to\ncheerfully while away a couple of\nhours. Q Stef\nC rash! Bang! Wallop! Jean-Claude Van\nDamme single-handedly levels a whole\nmarket with a vegetable-delivery scooter\nbefore causing it to become airborne and landing on a passing car. CRASH! He rescues his\nbest friend from a flaming van just before it\ngoes BANG! He beats the crap out of evil\nRussian assassin Red Face no less than three\ntimes before finishing him off with a knife in the\nguts WALLOP!\nAnd there it is. You see, although Maximum\nRisk does have all the ingredients that real films\nhave, like actors, a script and a storyline, you\nend up wishing it didn't. The story revolves around Alain Moreau\n(Van Damme), a French ex-marine who is now a detective in the south of France. One day there\nis a bit of a ruckus, apparently caused by a corpse with its legs sticking out through the broken windscreen of a car. Lo and behold the\ncadaver has exactly the same chiselled features\nas our hero. By a brilliant piece of intuition Alain\nrealises that this is his identical twin Mikhail\nfrom whom he was separated at birth and who\nwas a big-time gangster on the run from the\nbrutal Russian mob (no really!). Sensing something fishy going on, Inspector Moreau decides\nto travel to New York in order to get to know his\nlate sibling by discovering who killed him. En\nroute he gets in cahoots with his brother's girlfriend (Natasha Henstridge), breaks loads of fat\nbald guys' wrists, and discovers that his brother was a kind, generous and compassionate\ngangster who only killed people when it was\nabsolutely necessary.\nThe action sequences in the film are very\ncompetently handled, and the suspense and\ninterest are maintained for the whole 100 min-ute s, although I suspect that this is partly to do\nwith the audience hoping that the rather fragile\nplot will stay intact until the end, which it does.\nIt must be said that the acting falls a little short\nof Oscar material: Van Damme has spent years\nhoning his interpretation of a bit of cardboard\nand Henstridge is there purely to add some\nnudity to the proceedings.\nIf you go to see a film like this with your\ncritical functions intact you are bound to be dis-appointed. If you go drunk, stupid or merely\nwilling to have a laugh, then you won't be.\nMuch. \u2022\nDr Conzo\nA gang of five performing students\nfrom Up On The Roof\n\n"

To help you to decide\nwho to vote for, we interviewed the candidates live on IC Radio. Read, decide, and\nVOTE!\nCHARLIE JOYNT - STANDING FOR DEPUTY PRESIDENT (CLUBS AND SOCS)\nJeremy Thomson: Tell us about your previous experience - what makes you think you're\nup to the job?\nCharlie Joynt: I have been a member of the\nrugby club for two-and-a bit years now. 1 am\nnow running the third fifteen and the fourth fifteen on my own. I have personally managed to\narrange to get a fourth fifteen out for the first\ntime in recent history for the College. I am also\nan academic representative in my department\nso I am well used to sitting on really boring committees all day long. Quite frankly. 1 think my\nbest qualification for the job is that I am enthusiastic and 1 want to do this thing.\nJT: What are your three biggest strengths?\nCJ: My ability to work with people; I am fairly outgoing and quite approachable. 1 don't take\nthings too seriously; if someone comes along\nand tries to take the piss out of what 1 am doing,\nI am not going to go over the top about that. 1\nam well organised; my flat mates can vouch for\nthis, as they always moan about how my room\nis actually tidy!\nJT: And your three worst weaknesses?\nCJ: My weaknesses? A pint of beer. That will\nget me out of the office at any opportunity.\nOoh, dear... you've dug out all the real clich e questions, haven't you? Maybe I don't know\nwhat my weaknesses are... could that be a weakness?\nJT: The Christian Union has recently been\nrefused official society status in ICU because\nthey require all members of the committee to be\nChristian. How will you handle a similar situ a tion?\nCJ: All our societies should be open to any\nmember of the College, no matter what their\nbeliefs and backgrounds are. Many of our clubs\nrequire participation, the sports particularly. You\ncan't really expect to be a member of a sports\nclub without turning up to the games and such-like. However, in religious clubs or societies I would say that it is perfectly all right to have\nsomeone who isn't of your religion as a member.\n1 mean, they are quite able to have an interest in\nyour religion even if they don't subscribe to the\nbeliefs.\nJT: Are you aware of the conflict between\nthe IC and the ICSM BUSA entries, and how are\nyou going to resolve it?\nCJ: Oh, yes, this is a bit of a big one really.\nBUSA will allow the medics to play their own fixtures as ICSM. However I have just been\ninformed today that BUSA will not allow any\nmedic to play for Imperial, which causes a bit of\nstrife on some of the teams, where 1C SM do not\nput forward a team, for example fencing. This\nwould mean that people at Saint Mary's, Charing\nCross, or the other two schools of medicine,\nwould have a lot of trouble to partake in the\nactivity as under ICSM. I think really we should\ntackle BUSA and tell them that they have to take\neach sport individually. Some sports, fine; ICSM\ncan put out their own team. I am quite happy\nfor that tradition to go on; I don't want to stop\nit. However, where BUSA are starting to get a bit\nshirt y about entries and suchlike, then 1 think we\nwill have to get on to them.\nJT: Do you think you have a good chance of\ngetting BUSA to change their policy on this one?\nCJ: Changing BUSA policy? They're a bit\nintractable really. However I wouldn't like to say\nthat we will turn a blind eye to BUSA regulations.\nIf BUSA try to split up our rowing team, for\nexample, which is excellent and has many\nmedics among its ranks, then we cannot stand\nfor that.\nJT: You come from a sporting background.\nHow are you going to overcome your personal\nleanings and promote all clubs equally?\nCJ: 1 am not sure that 1 have any personal\nleanings particularly to the sports. I have more\nexperience of sports, but I am not a one-sided\ncharacter. I have much interest in music; my\nflat-mates would sneer at me if I said I was\ninterested in art; but I am perfectly able to\nappreciate other clubs and societies and their\ninterests.\nJT: In your manifesto, you promise ACC and\nRCC dinners and balls. Explain further...\nCJ: This college is really quite dire as far as\nsocial ising goes. We have reasonable attendance at our Friday ents nights, but we are a bit\nlacking when it comes to a good knees-up.\nAnyone who has seen Southside Bar on\nWednesday night would agree that a ball with all\nthe sports clubs would be an amusing event.\nWhat is more, the other clubs, the ones that are\nnot competitive sports, the recreational clubs,\nand possibly the social clubs, would also be able\nto put on a good do. The most social people in\nthis college are members of clubs and societies.\nAiming an annual do at these people would be a success.\nJT: And your short questions: Number one.\nHow many clubs are there at the St Mary's cam-pus?\nCJ: I am not exactly sure. There is probably\nin the range of about twenty.\nJT: What's the maximum funding a club may\nreceive from the Union?\nCJ: I am not sure. I could tell you within five\nminutes of being in the job though.\nJT: Do you think that the IC Rugby team\nfirsts can beat the ICSM team?\nCJ: I would like to see them have a go.\nJT: What's your favourite sporting joke?\nCJ: Jeremy Guscott in fishnet stockings!\nMARK BAKER AND ANDREW HEEPS - BOTH\nSTANDING FOR\nPRESIDENT OF ICU\nJT: Tell us about your previous experience -what makes you think you're up to the job?\nAndrew Heeps: I'm currently vice-president\nof the Charing Cross Union. I lead the largest\ndelegation to the British Youth Parliament,\nwhich is a sub-organisation of the Home Office.\nI 've been involved in representing people of\nboth my own age group and elsewhere, for a total of ten years now. I think that my actual\nexperience of being a people's representative is\nquite high and I don't see my lack of past ICU\ninvolvement being a problem.\nthey will lose a considerable number of clubs\nand the loss of accommodation for non-first\nyears. How are you going to break the bad news\nand deal with the inevitable backlash?\nMB: I think the way to \"break the bad news\"\nis to make sure that they are involved and that\nthey understand what is going to happen. I will\nbe telling all the constituent college unions and\nall the clubs exactly how we are going to allocate the money and how things will be done,\nand the better prepared and more involved people are in the process, the fairer it will seem and\nJT: Okay,\nMark, can you come\nin on that?\nMark Baker: Yes. I'm currently Publications\nBoard chair; I oversee the running of all the\nmedia and help out with any of their problems.\nI was also a member of UFC last year. I was on\nthe budgets' advisory group which is a very long\nand boring meeting going through every single\nbudget of all of the clubs at ICU; there are a large number of those; I tried to sort them out\nand I looked at them fairly. I have also been to\nquite a few council meetings and executive\nmeetings, so I am well used to how ICU runs,\nand I think 1 understand enough about it to be\nits President.\nJT: The Medical students are facing massive\ncuts in their union funding, the probability that\nthe less complaints people will have. As for\ndealing with the backlash; I will be trying to minimise it, but I would be there to be yelled at as\nPresident and I would try to make people see\nthat we are reasonable.\nJT: Andy, being honest or being nice; can\nyou do both?\nAH: Well, you can always try to work in the\nbest interests of the majority of the member-ship. That is perhaps where this issue goes in.\nThere are one thousand five hundred medics\nwho are there at the moment who didn't actually apply to Imperial; people who, although they\nare very keen on the merger, do not want to see\ntheir history and traditions going. Over the next\nsix years any backlash that is going to come out\nwill fade away, and I think that is how we should\nbe working. As to the allocation of funding,\nthere is a distinct need to keep services that\nalready exist there in some cases. Yes, medics\nare going to have to lose some clubs and soci-e ties. It is the same on the main campus. The\nclubs and societies that are not performing, that\nare not providing the services, well, they may\nhave to lose out. The money must be allocated\nwhere it is needed. Following that policy through\nto its logical conclusion, I think there will be less\ntear-shedding than is currently predicted.\nJT: What action are you going to take to get\nrid of tuition fees?\nMB: Well, I actually went on a march this\nweekend against tuition fees, which demonstrated my support. I will also be campaigning\nwherever possible against the introduction of\ntuition fees, but I am not planning to bomb the\nHouses of Parliament or anything!\nJT: Any direct policy on that, Andy?\nAH: I think the most important thing to do is\nto distance ourselves from anything the NUS\nhas been saying. The ICU response to Dearing is\ncoming up quite soon; it is currently being written and 1 want to see a full and frank debate\nthere. I want to know what people think. 1 am\nfundamentally against tuition fees being intro-duce d.1 don't see how you can have education\nbased upon the ability of people to pay as\nopposed to the ability to learn. It is fundamentally wrong.\nJT: I would like to give you both an opportunity to criticise each other, starting with Mark.\nDo you have anything to say against Andy?\nMB: No, surprisingly not! I think Andy is a very nice blok e. My one criticism would be that,\nthrough no fault of his own, Charing Cross has\nonly just recently merged with IC so he has not\nhad that much experience of Imperial College\nUnion.\nJT: And Andy?\nAH: Well, of course, leaving the hair aside,\nMark...\nMB:.Oh, thanks...\nAH: No, 1 completely agree with that; I think\nMark's a great blok e. We went for lunch somewhere last week and we keep bumping into each\nother and chatting. The reason I am standing and\nnot giving way to him is that I feel that this new\nimpetus of fresh air, this fresh person at the top\nof the Union, will provide the momentum\nrequired to prepare ICU for the next century.\nJT: A question specifically for Andy: Your\nface is not particularly familiar at South\nKensington. With the lack of a hand-over period,\nsurely you are not going to have time to get to\nknow all the union officers and college figures?\nAH: As far as the Union is concerned, I have\nalready given that a lot of thought, and my priority over the first two weeks in office would be\nto meet as many people as possible. Obviously\npeople would have to work with me on that,\nalthough I am sure that people would be quite\nkeen to meet the new ICU President. It is also\nvalid knowing that there is a very competent\nteam at the top already and we are just filling a few gaps in that competent team. So 1 have no\nworries that they will pull me up if I am not\nspeaking to the right people or doing whatever.\nIf anything it could be a benefit because it is not\nthe same old tired faces and approaches coming forward and seeing people.\nJT: And one for Mark: Student numbers are\ndue to rise by at least 25% next year\nwith the arrival of the medical pre-cl in ical students. What are you going to do\nto enlarge and improve social space, other than\nthe Beit Hall basement already offered?\nMB: I would quite like to see us getting more\nspace from College, if possible, because Biology\nare vacating their area, so 1 think we should be\nable to get some more space from that. I would\nlike to see the JCR improved, because that's an\nexisting space which is very poorly used at the\nmoment.\nJT: And now I have some short answer ques-t ions. Starting with Andy:\nHow many signatures of ICU are required to\ncall an Emergency General Meeting?\nAH: Off the top of my head, fifty. [Correct\nanswer: one hundred.]\nJT: Mark recently did a quad run; would you\ntake off all your clothes in the interests of the\nunion?\nAH: I was actually asked to, and I think it is\ncredit to me that I was clever enough to find\nsomeone else to do it for me!\nJT:A student is caught smoking cannabis in\nhalls. Is this a matter for the Union, the College\nor the Police?\nAH: 1 cannot condone breaking the law.\nJT: So you think it is a matter for the Police?\nAH: Yes. I am not saying that it is the Union's place to report it, but I cannot condone breaking the law.\nJT: Do you know how much you will be paid,\nand do you care?\nAH: No. 1 don't know how much at all. 1\nknow accommodation is provided, which would\nsuit me down to the ground. Eric [Allsop] does-n't seem to have lost any weight over the last\nyear, so I am sure there is enough money there\nto be able to eat!\nJT: What are the last two Union events you\nattended?\nAH: I was in on the Wednesday of Fresher's week, and 1 visited the Royal School of Mines\nHalloween party on Thursday.\nJT: Thank you very much, Andy. And now\nMark's questions: What is the address of the\nHammersmith Royal Postgraduate Medical\nSchool?\nMB: I don't know.\nJT: Good! What is the annual turnover of the\nUnion?\nMB: I believe it is nearly a million pounds.\n[Correct answer: \u00a3999,400.]\nJT: As required by Regulation 7.5.6 pertaining to \"Standing Orders For Council And General\nMeetings\", what must a Council member do\nbefore voting?\nMB: Oh, think!\nJT: That's right! Question four: Do you take\nillegal substances?\nMB: No comment!\nJT: Last question: briefly, what is the\nGoverning body, and when does it meet?\nMB: Well, that's pretty self-explanatory: it is\nthe governing body of Imperial College! 1 don't actually know when it meets, because, funnily\nenough, students don't actually get invited along\nto it. As President, I would find out when it\nmeets.\n\n"

    "content": "26 FICTION 7 November 1997\nThe Man With The Ten Bob Note - Part Two\nA story by Buz Barstow\nThat of course was before now.\nHe'd been falling, that was for sure.\nHe'd now landed, and woken up on\na rock near a pool of hydrocarbons.\nIt seemed awfully familiar, and when\nhe cocked his head, he realised\nwhy. The outpost was only a few\nhundred meters away, and there\nwas a pod outside. He'd been res-cued, they'd come just in time. It\nwas unusually calm for the day of\nreckoning though. Not wanting to\nargue he staggered back to the out-post. It had been four hours since\nhe climbed up to that elevation.\nStrange then, that the clocks in\nthe outpost should show it was the\nday of his arrival, 3 days earlier. That\ndidn't matter, the prospect of rescue was more appealing than the\ntiming mystery. He wavered\ntowards the landing pad. No rescue\nparty was there for him. The pod\nwas his. He turned around, towards\nthe lounge area. The door was\nopen, the lights were on. The\nwoman was on the red sofa he'd placed her on, and nearby was a man in a flight suit. It was him.\nIt was him. He'd just walked in\nthrough the door. He, I, looked ter-rib le, covered in oily sludge. Can't be me. He looked startled. I looked\nstartled. We raised our right hands.\nCan't be me.\nThe man in the new flight suit,\nme? It is me? \"Go, now, take the\nwoman!\" I screamed. I don't know\nwhy I said that. It excluded me.\nPerhaps I felt excluded already.\n\"Name? Rank? Serial number?\"\nShouted me. I gave them all to me.\nMe agreed. 1 agreed too. \"Who are\nyou?\" Me shouted. I gave it a moments thought.\n\"you\" was all I could muster. \"1\nsaid take the woman and go!\" I repeated. \"There's no time to\nexplain.\" I picked up the woman's legs, and gestured him to take her\nshoulders. Me looked distrustfully at\nme, but he did as I suggested.\n\"There's only supplies for one on\nthe pod\" me suggested.\n\"Don't worry about it. Make it\nlast, just go. There is no more time.\nGo!\" I said. I ushered myself into the\npod and closed the hatch behind\nhim, watched as the pod climbed\nout of the atmosphere, and started\nto wait all over again.\nYou'd think that experience\nwould change the man's decisions\nover the next few days. It didn't. He\nplayed them out just as he had\nbefore. Wasting time, followed by a desperate urge to preserve it.\nThe third day arrived again.\nFissures formed in the ground, the\nsky turned red as the planet's atmosphere intersected with violently moving plasma. Two days had\ngiven the man time to think about\nhis place of hiding. A rock formation\nlay about 500 meters away from the\noutpost, the survey team had\nexplored it, and their reports suggested that it might provide some\nprotection from the high velocity\nwinds and lightning that now\nscourged the moon, at least until\nhelp came. He'd set off earlier this\ntime, and had a chance to watch\neach stage of the death of the out-post. He gave life the best shot he\ncould, but like the moon, he was\ndoomed. He imagined Bach's Toccata E Fugue in D minor as he\napproached his confrontation with\noblivion. There was no better way to\nimprove his solitary death. He had-n't given much thought to the\nencounter with himself earlier, but\nas death became increasingly\ninevitable, that seemed like the only\napt thing to fear. Not death itself,\nbut what happened to him before,\nand the possibility of repetition.\nHe stuck his head above the\nrocks one last time, to see if help\nhad arrived. The rocks were quite as\nstable as he'd hoped. Caught up in a rolling land slide, operatic screaming\nwas the only thing that came to\nmind.\nAlmost ashamed by his lack of con-tro l, the man pulled himself out of\nthe sludge lake that was nearby the\nrock formation. He surveyed the\narea, and again, the outpost had\nbeen reborn. The pod was parked\noutside again.\nIt had all come full circle, like\nbefore. He ventured inside. Making\nno attempt to check that the pod\nwas his, as he was sure it was, he\nmade his way to the lounge. Like\nbefore, he stood there, as real as\nhimself. Both considered for a moment. He'd chosen self sacrifice\nand generosity on two previous\noccasions. This time he was thinking\ndifferently. \"Go, I don't have time to\nexplain.\"\nThe other man, him, again\ndemanded explanation, ident if ica tion. Something, to confirm what his\nsenses told him to be true. Meeting\nyourself is more than just looking in\nthe mirror, it's something no one\nhas ever experienced before, and\nwithout a suitable reference frame,\nyou find it hard to discuss, even with\nyourself.\nEvery time he tried it, it was fruit-less, he ended up ushering himself\noff the moon, with or without the\nwoman, more times than cared to\nremember.\nThat was about 4 iterations\nworth. More than enough for any\none man. He'd given up being a passive observer, hoping for rescue.\nThis time he would find out what\nwas happening to him, and why.\nHis fourth 'death' was approach-ing. He'd run out of time, he considered ending it, by simply letting himself die, but that wouldn't be good\nenough. He'd have to fight it out like\nbefore. So again, he ran to the rock\nto look for a hiding place. There was\nno shelter, as before, just the strong\nrebuttal of falling.\nThe fifth iteration began. Waking up\nin a primordial soup was becoming\ntiresome. He looked for the out-post, and walked towards it. Once\nagain, he greeted himself, already\nhaving learnt how to introduce himself to his antecedent self without\ntoo much confusion.\nThis time though, he explained\nthe situation to himself, and to that\nmatter to his antecedent self. He\nwas surprisingly glad to help him-self.\nThe investigation comprised of a resume of the events which led the\nman to his current predicament.\nFollowed by downloading of the\npod's sensor logs to the outpost's computer.\nAs a scientific research station,\nthe outpost had been built with a handsome array of instruments.\nSome had been left behind to get a first person perspective on the\nbreak up of a solar system. This was\nplenty, at least he hoped.\nThe instruments detected what\nthey interpreted as a series of fractures across the time - space con-tin u um. All of which, in a flight of\nfancy could leave this first man\nstuck in this loop. But in reality,\nprobably wouldn't. Man alive! They\nweren't gods, he weren't gods, to be\nmore precise. Not even their language had developed to be useful in\nthis situation.\nSo, what was he to do? The\nantecedent man had a suggestion.\nThat he remain on the planet for a few iterations, and then get another\nto do the same, and so on, forever\nand ever. The idea had appeal, but it\nwould sentence a part of the man to\neternal imprisonment on this world.\nBut, it was the best he, or is that\nanyone, could come up with, so he\ntook the suggestion for all it was\nworth.\nThat wasn't the entire plan\nthough. Well, only the first man\nknew really what the whole idea\nwas. In those 5 iterations of the\nloop, the man had changed, he was-n't the same man he was only 15\ndays ago (if, in fact it was 15 days\nago, rather than just 15 days worth\nof atomic vibrations ago?).\nThe first man climbed into the\npod. The woman had died of her\ninjuries several days ago, so there\nwas no need to worry about life sup-port. He strapped himself in and\nbegan to initial is e his inertia less drive unit. The man he once was\nbegan to close the hatch on him. He\nreached for a weapon in the cockpit\nand fired at the other man's chest.\nLeft a neat whole through it. No\nblood, it cauterized the wound\ninstantly. He collapsed on the landing pad. The man closed the hatch\nhimself. That was a mercy killing, to\nstop him going through the torment\nhe'd faced.\nHe fired the thrusters on the\nbottom of the pod and accelerated\nupwards. Of course, the man didn't notice any of this, except the\nstrange feeling that he should be\nfeeling something as the clouds\npassed by ever faster.\nThe pod entered a flight path\nthat would take it into orbit, and\nfrom there, home. The pod planted\nitself into a geostationary orbit\nabove the outpost, ready to make\nits final orbital calculations. Getting\nfrom planet to planet was easy, it\nhad been done for centuries, getting\nfrom this moon to the mothership,\navoiding a black hole, a violently\nenraged solar wind, rapidly crumbling asteroids and planets and a plasma streamer was, well, a slightly harder computational puzzle. The\nman had little doubt however of the\nflight computer's ability to perform\nthese small miracles.\nconcluding part next week\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURE 7\nAs I write, President Clinton\nhas just ripped up what is left of\nthe Rio summit commitments,\nabandoning his\nelection FB <\npledge to cut\ncarbon dioxide\nemissions in the\nyear 2000 to 1990\nlevels. The reason\ngiven, in typically\n|3\u00bb Orwellian fashion, is that\nthe US is somehow a 'special' case - that is they\nare a bigger polluter,\naccounting for 22% of the\nworld's carbon dioxide\nemissions, and therefore\nhave greater difficulty in\ncomplying. This signals a little substance. But the reality is\nthat a major power shift has\noccurred. The combination of the\ninformation revolution and an\nobsession with free trade, has created a situation in which the balance between national governments and big business has\nchanged. For example, the World\nBank has calculated that of the\n100 largest definable economic\nunits, only half of them are co un tries, the rest businesses. The\nimplications of this trend are considerable and there is much to be\nsaid about the threat that such\npowerful business interests poses\nto our democratic institutions. But\nrather that focusing on that, I Winning complete U turn, as\nup until a few weeks\nago Clinton had kept up\nhigh profile support for\nthe Rio targets. However,\nunder stiff opposition from\nIf the business community,\nwhich has spent millions on\ntelevision advertisements\nplaying on the fear of job in security, he crum-pled. So yet\nagain, Clinton startles us with his\npower for re in ven tion. The aggressive\nfree-market e ers call\nthe shots and Clinton's interventionist policies end up in the\nbucket.\nIt is easy to\nridicule the\nDemocrats, and\nNew Labour for that\nmatter, for the ease\nwith which we have\nmoved from the\nReagan-Thatcher era\nto the Clinton-Blair\nera, with so much\nrhetoric and so\nchocolate manufacturers\nbuilt model villages, businesses are at present\nchurning out ethical state-ment s. Business 'ethics'\nhas become as much of a buzz-word in the nineties as\n'down-sizing' was in the eighties.\nUndoubtedly, the substance of\nthese 'ethical' guidelines varies\nconsiderably. There are broadly\nthree different categories, which\ncould be defined as ' fund a men tal', 'tinkering' and 'green-wash'.\nOn the positive side, there\nhave been notable successes of\nbusinesses which have managed to consolidate their market position by putting\ninto place far reaching and highly\naccountable standards of\nbusiness practice - the 'fun-da mental s'. The most\nobvious example in\nmm Britain of this fundamental approach is the\nsuccess of the Cooperative Bank.\nIn the middle there\nare a number of companies who are at pre-Roulette... would like to consider how this\nchange has altered the way business perceives itself, and plot the\nrise of business ethics.\nTraditional wisdom is that business operates within the rules of\nsociety. In other words, society\ncontains business so the ethics of\nthe society are the ethics of bus i ness. But what if a business is so\npowerful that it is bigger than the\nsociety in which it is based? Who\ndecides what the acceptable limits\nare? This a very crude model of\nwhat is happening right now. An\ninternal crisis has been generated\nwithin the business community\nitself as decision makers increasingly find that traditional boundaries of good practice are ineffectual. Relying on external discipline\nis no longer tenable. The consequence is that with the zeal with\nwhich the nineteenth century\nsent 'tinkering' with the mechanism of their business structure.\nExamples include B&.Q' s work with\nthe World Wildlife Fund, to analyse\nthe sustainability of their timber\nsources, and the positive noises\ncoming from certain supermarkets\nfollowing Christian Aid's campaign\nto establish guidelines for the\nworking conditions of those producing food in the developing\nworld.\nOn the other extreme there are\nthose who are blatantly 'green\nwashing' their organisations with\nthe help of their publicity depart-ment s. There are too many of them\nto list, but as a general principle\nkeep away from anything that has\nno third party monitoring or alternatively has Linda McCartney's signature on the front.\nPerhaps the greatest steps forward have been in the financial\nsector. 'Ethical Investments' in\nBritain now account for billions,\nand most building societies now\noffer such policies. E1RIS, the only\nfirm of Independent Financial\nAdvisers who offer advice on\nEthical Investments in this country,\nare turning away work. However,\nthe importance of the ethical\nfinancial sector is not simply it's size but it's far\nreaching influence. One of\nthe most\neffective ways\nof altering\nbusiness practice is to refuse to\nlend money on 'ethical' grounds.\nIt is for this reason that the\ncampaign to form an ethical policy\nfor the USS pension fund (that of\nyour lecturers) is so important. The\nfund is worth 13.5 billion pounds\nor more than double the total of\nethical investments in this country,\nso could have an enormous influence on financial practice. Also, as\nthe pension is guaranteed by the\ngovernment, such a change would\nhave no impact on the pension\nthat individuals receive. (1 don't pretend to be an expert on this\nmatter but if you are the kind of\nperson who is, someone would be\ndelighted to speak to you at the\ncontact address below). So what\nwould such an ethical policy\ninclude? As a model, the Co-operative Bank's is an excellent starting\npoint.\n1997 FEATURE 15\nthe bank will 'actively seek out'\norganisations which promote positive environmental steps, fair trade\nand generally will try to work with\nthose who conduct business activity from an ethically consistent\nstandpoint. These are the most\nwoolly parts of the policy but also\nthe most important as they define\nthe business culture.\nThere is nothing very radical\nabout this policy, in fact, I'm sure that I could have hammered it out with my\ngranny over a cup of tea.\nBut it is a good start, and\nwhere there is 13.5 billion\npounds at stake it is certainly worth doing.\nIf you want to find out more\nabout this campaign please pick\nup a leaflet, contact me\n(t. hay@ic.ac.uk), or the campaign\ndirectly at USS, 4A East Avenue,\nOxford OX4 IXW, e mail\nethics4 uss@ acc.dundee.ac.uk.\nLeaflets are available today from\nFelix distribution points.\nTom Hay\nContained within\nthe ethical policy are a number of different\nkinds of statements.\nFirstly, there are the\ngeneral clauses\nconcerned with\nbasic standards.\nOn a general level\nthe bank is committed to not\ninvest in organisations which undermine human\nrights, damage the\nenvironment excessively and\nsell arms to\noppressive regimes (whoever they are). Other\n'forbidding' clauses include ones\non much more specific issues like\nthe tobacco trade and animal\nexperimentation for cosmetics,\nand specifically in the area of\nfinance there is clause which forbids speculation on the pound.\nThe rationale for this is that the\nbank would be profiting at the\nexpense of its customers, the\nBritish taxpayer.\nAll the policies 1 have noted so\nfar are the passive statements,\nthose that set up a framework\nwithin which the bank acts as a moral arbiter; a list of criteria\nwhich all borrowers must comply\ntoo. But the Co-operative Bank is\nalso committed to nurturing good\npractice. Contained within the policy are statements of intent that\nTitanic\nTom Hay details the rise of ethical Investment in a world of supranational corporations\n\n"

    "content": "18 MUSIC 7 November 1997\nALBUMS THE CURE Galore it it it v2 The all new\nCure! (cheerful-ness somehow\nincluded).\nNo, no this is not a brand\nnew Cure album as in totally new material, but it is a collection of their singles from\n1987 to 1997, the most recent\nbeing the Jesus Jones-ey sounding\nWrong Number that has just\nrecently been released. You could\nconsider this as their follow up to\nthe previous singles collection\nStaring At The Sea, ('79- '85).\nIf you've got most of their\nalbums then you'd probably have\nheard all of these tracks anyway\nbut if not, then this is a perfect way\nto get some of their most cracking\ntracks. Some of the more outstanding ones are Fascination\nStreet, and the absolutely fantastic\nJust Like Heaven which alone\nmakes this album worth getting.\nPictures of You is another gem\nworthy of a mention, along with\nthe three singles off Wish, which\nFriday I'm In Love is undoubtedly\nthe best. There are a couple of\nrather dubious sounding pop\nefforts in the form of Why Can'tI Be You, though the quality of the\nrest of the songs helps you to forget about these minor blemishes.\nBasically this album contains all the\nCure songs you've heard, you may\nnot know them all by name, but\nyou will after a listen, d Jason\nMOBY I Like To Score * *\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but\nwhy is it that none of these\ntracks has been more publicised. This is probably because\nthese are pretty mediocre offerings\nfrom the king of the club scene. I love Moby's old stuff and 1 was\nreally looking forward to hearing\nthis album but unfortunately it\nturned out to be a bit of a disappointment, not to say that all of the\ntracks are bad, as there are some\nthat recapture his old brilliance.\nThe first thing I have to mention\nabout the album is the phenomenal\namount of bullshit printed in the\nsleeve. I don't think that anyone\napart from a trained politician, or\npossibly a maths lecturer, could\nwrite something so unintelligible\nand still expect people to read it.\nThe James Bond remix of the\noriginal theme tune is quite catchy,\nbut may offend true fans of Bond\nas it has used Pierce Brosnan's voice for those immortal words\n'My name is Bond, James Bond'\n(cue strong but knowledgeable\nglance).\nThen there is Moby's offering\nfor the soundtrack of the Saint.\n'What?' I may hear you ask, 'Moby\ndid a track for the Saint?'. Now 1\nam sure everyone has heard the\nOrb's contribution, which was\nactually quite good, and is now\nwondering why they didn't know\nMoby was on there as well. It's simple, the track doesn't hold a light up to that of the Orb and\ndeserves to remain unknown.\nGuitars have become more\nprominent in Moby's work and he\nhas used them in a few of these\ntracks. Now in one song they are\nput to good use, but in the other,\nwell I can hardly bring myself to talk\nabout it, they are painful to listen\nto. Imagine your Dad's favourite\nStatus Quo chorus double it and\nyou will be getting close to the level\nof chee zy ness involved here. All I can say is why? CI\nSimon V. SINGLES Ladysmith Black Mambazo - Inkanyezi Nezazi\n(The star and the wiseman)\nWho? The cover, similar to a Heinz soup can\nlabel, should have told me. This pleasant\nAfrican tribal chant music is the theme from a Heinz TV ad. Unlikely to have the success of\njeans ad music but never the less this is a lovely mellow tune. Ideal music for those lazy\nSunday afternoons or maybe even a bowl of\nsoup!\nFoil - Reviver Gene\nA fantastic strong guitar sound propels you at\nhigh speed through this tune which is combined\nwith an excellent vocalist to complete the experience. A definite must have will be their debut\nalbum Spread it all around. Look out for these\nguys they deserve to do well.\nCath Coffey - Tell Me\nGentle soulful lyrics with a synth beat box back-ground. Fairly inoffensive and plain tune which\nis likely to appeal to people who don't care what\nthey listen to. The b side contains a couple of\nre-mixes by A Guy Called Gerald and Steve\nOsborne. They manage to add a bit of flair to\nthe proceedings but unfortunately some lyrics\nstill remain.\nTin Star - Disconnected Child\nA gentle drum beat with a hint of trance in there\nsomewhere slowly combines and builds into an\nexcellent tune with perfectly timed highs and\nlows. Lyrics are skillfully and unobtrusively used\nto top it all off. Definitely worth buying especially for the b side which is a longer and,\nundoubtedly, better mix. Unlikely to be a chart\nsuccess but should get a bit of attention in club-land.\nESSENTIAL CHOON Beck - Deadweight\nBeck has produced some excellent original\nmusic in the past. So it is no surprise that this\nis yet another. Funky lyrics backed by a myriad\nof instruments skillfully packaged into a masterpiece Taken from the soundtrack of the recently released film A Life Less Ordinary,\nDeadweight is bound to take the chart by storm.\nIf I hadn't been given a freebie I'd be at the front\nof the queue to buy this one.\nMark P Dawn of the Replicants - Rhino Rays EP\nThe first track , Radars, on this four track EP\nstarts off with a melodic distorted guitar intro\nand then progresses into a more discordant\nsound in the same vein as Subcircus. However\nthe rest are pretty average on the whole.\nFlyscreen - / Wanna Be In A New York Punk <\nBand\nAnother four track EP with three tracks under\nthree minutes long, very punk indeed. These\nsongs aren't exactly hard hitting punk but only\nabout halfway there, and soon lose their appeal\nafter a couple of listens.\nPulp - Help The Aged\nThere was a rumour floating around that Pulp\nwere only going to release this single in Help\nThe Aged charity shops so that it wouldn't qualify for a chart position. Top idea. It is a typical\nPulp track with Jarvis being his usual witty self.\nSFA - Demons\nThis is a really soothing mellow track that kicks\nin at the chorus, a real pogo-er. Although the\nlast single from SFA wasn't much cop, this one\nshows that they've still got a bit left in them.\n/as on "

Funnily enough, the most\nembarrassing thing that can happen to anyone is not being tied\nupside down naked to a lamp-post\nin Trafalgar Square (despite what\nthose at Saint Mary's might think),\nit is tripping over a slightly lifted\nflagstone on a busy Christmasshopping rush Oxford Street.\nActually, no. Maybe I was right first\ntime.\nAny readers who spend their\ntime theorising about the existence\nor non-existence of some all-see-ing divine entity (and, in a radical\nbreak with tradition, we're going to\ncall him God), may be interested to\nlearn that the concept of embarrassment is evidence in the a rgu ment. It goes something like this: if\nGod did not create everything, and\nindeed we did appear courtesy of\nthe Darwinian theory of natural\nselection, then why do we feel\nembarrassment? I can not really\nsee it serving any useful purpose in\nnature. The only difference it\nmakes to predator and prey is that\nthe freshly-captured rodent blushes\nslightly when he is noisily gobbled\nup by the ocelot, as his drinking\nmates laugh at him for not being\nable to run fast enough.\nNo, embarrassment is another\none of God's little jokes. Did He\nreally rest on the seventh day?\nPicture the scene; everyone is\nsleeping off their Sunday lunch and\nwatching Jimmy White lose yet\nanother frame to Stephen Hendry.\nOur Creator is bored. What can He\ndo? Well, for His own amusement,\nHe strolls downstairs to the lab\nand, using only aliphatic hydrocarbons and an old bottle of Jack\nDaniels that He found behind the\nPersil, God formulates embarrass-ment. (You must remember that He\nhad not yet thought of the Sony\nPlaystation.) Chalk another one up\nfor the believers.\nSo this is why the socially inept\namongst us (myself included) look\nfor a space between two molecules\ninto which to crawl when we slip\nover in the street, or queue at the\nwrong side of the till in a shop. This\nis the reason for wanting to throw\nyourself off Battersea Bridge when\nyour bike chain falls off just before\nthe lights change (just ask the\nFeatures Editor), and this is what\nmakes alcohol such an amusing\nsubstance for fresher s everywhere.\nOh, dear, I'm almost out of\nspace.

    "content": "20 FILM 7 November 1997\nREVIEWS AND COMPETITION\nACE/0\nStarring: John Travolta\nNicolas Cage\nDirector: John Woo\nF ace/Off may have a strange\ntitle, but it is one of the best\naction films you will see this\nyear. FBI agent Sean Archer ( John Travolta) is out to get psychopathic\nterrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage)\nwho murdered his son. Troy is\ncaptured but in a coma, meaning\nArcher must become Troy via cosmetic surgery, in order to locate\nTroy's deadly bomb. In a gory\nsequence, Archer and Troy have\ntheir faces removed and Archer has\nTroy's face put on his head. Archer\nNicolas Cage is the sadistic\nterrorist... isn't he?\nenters prison, not realising that\nTroy has woken from his coma.\nDiscovering what has occurred,\nTroy has the surgery performed on\nhimself and takes Archer's face,\nbefore killing all the people who\nknew that Archer was now Troy.\nArcher must escape from prison,\nrecover his face and save his family\nfrom a lunatic that everyone thinks\nis a national hero\nWhile this may seem like a confusing premise for a film, it works\nsplendidly. The performances from\nTravolta and Cage are superb, each\nimpersonating the other's walks\nand mannerisms perfectly. The\nsupporting cast are also excellent,\nbut the main kudos goes to the\ndirector, John Woo.\nFinally allowed a free hand after\nprevious studio interference in his\nAmerican films, his abilities shine\nas he shows what he can do with\nhis dazzling camera work, slo-mo\nand choreographed gun sequences\nin some of the loudest and most\nexciting set pieces ever seen.\nHowever, the film, while an action\nthriller on the surface, has depth as\nJohn Travolta\ngives an\noutstanding\nperformance\nthe two leads become more entangled with each other's families,\ncoming to terms with the loss of\nclose relatives and with their\ndiametrically opposed characters.\nThis is the sort of high-quality\nblockbuster you wish Hollywood\nmade more often. O David Norman\nMY MOTHER'S COURAGE\nStarring: George Tabori\nPauline Collins\nDirector: Michael Verhoeven\nM ost films about the\nHolocaust are based on a true story and this one is\nno exception. It centres upon a day\nin the life of Mrs Tabori, a Hungarian Jew played by Pauline\nCollins. It shows her arrest during\nNazi Germany, her deportation to\nAuschwitz and her subsequent\nescape helped by a German officer.\nThis all happens in time for her to\nreturn home and play Bridge.\nThe surreal nature of the plot is\nechoed in the staging of the film.\nGlibly described as a trag i comedy\nby the director, it features slapstick\nand observational comedy\nthroughout. Whilst novel, the\nhomage to novel cinema seems out\nof place in a film with such a serious theme and detracts from\nthe impact of the story. This is\nsymptomatic of a seeming unwillingness within the film to tackle the\nunpleasant questions raised by the\nHolocaust. Narrated by Mrs\nTabori's real-life son, we are given\nthe impression of a naive housewife unwilling to come to terms\nwith the reality of her situation yet\nthis is completely ignored in the\nnarrative. The film has a surprisingly lightweight feel and ultimately\nsuffers from trying to cover too\nmuch in too little time. O Charles Carter\nFILM COMP RT IT I with \u00ab WO DE friends at the KENSINGTON The film of the moment is clearly Face-Oft, the high-tech face-swapping\nthriller starring Nicolas Cage and |oh n Travolta.

    "content": "7 November 1997\nBriefly...\nMECH ENG\nSPRINGS A LEAK\nLast Friday water could be seen\npouring down on to the main\nwalkway as a pipe in the mechanical engineering building burst.\nBetween noon and one pm a considerable amount of water\ncascaded from the building causing some concern. Security was\nalerted and after investigation the\nculprit was found to be a burst\nsteam pipe on the fifth floor. It\nwas found that the pipe cracked\ndue to the strain put on it when\nthe central heating system was\nswitched on. An electrician was\ncalled in to examine the area to\nprevent a potentially hazard situation evolving.\nVery little damage was\ncaused by the leakage as the\nwater only seemed to mainly run\nthrough the outer shell of the\nbuilding.\nThe advent of winter has\ncaused similar incidents such as\nthese around the college.\nTony Of on\nNEWS\nApplications fall\nImperial seems to have been\nsheltered so far from a drop in\napplications that has left UCAS\nrec i pts down by 1\n6\n%\n. The fall is\nbeing blamed on the government's introduction of \u00a3 I OOO-per-year\ntuition fees for students starting\ntheir courses next autumn.\nThere were 5570 applications\nto undergraduate courses at IC\nafter three weeks of the UCAS system being open. This is down 5.6%\nfrom the same period last year,\nwhen there were 5899. The 'home'\nstudent applications, which come\nfrom the group affected by the fee\nintroduction, were down 7.9% from\nlast year.\nDavid Atkins, Senior Assistant\nRegistrar (Admissions) said that he\nthought this sort of fluctuation was\nDohii\n\"quite normal\", adding that the\napplications last year were up by\n3.9%. He also commented that\nthere seemed to be a systems failure at UCAS over the last week,\nthat had left applications numbers\nseem \"very low\".\nThe majority of early applications have been for Oxford and\nCambridge candidates, and it is\nreported that the applications for\nOxbridge (which have now closed)\nare down by 9%.\nThere are various theories over\nwhy the applications numbers are\ndown. One is that potential students are being put off by fees, and\nso are choosing not to go to university for fear of running up huge\ndebts. Another is that many students who would have applied this\nyear after a year out came to university without taking a gap year in\norder to miss the fees. However,\nconfusion still surrounds their intro-duct ion, with some suggesting that\nthe fees will apply to all in universi-ty, regardless of the degree start\ndate.\nImperial College is officially not\nin favour of fees, but any fee introduction would be across the board.\nMr Atkins added that Imperial\nis more interested in the standard\nof applications than the number,\nand that \"the academic quality of\nthe students applying to the college is as high as ever.\"\nMatthew Bennett\nICU Council is not on the 4 November at all - It's on the 18 November at 6pm in the RehOldsii:\nBuilding, Charing Cross Campus, Fulham Road.\nSome. n PG Group Chair, two I st year ordinary members and two ordinary members to the Retail and Service's Committee.\nEvei j KUt ff IfHOTrome to attend and get involved - have your say on how your union is run.\n\n"

This\ndemonstration, supported by iCU's Labour Club, marks the start of a large campaign which 1 urge all 1C students to get involved in.

Can they\nplease grow up, enter the real\nworld, and play something differ-ent.\nI'm not the only one with the\nproblem, most people are fed up\nwith it too.

I hope the right people\nare reading this.\nGood Luck,\nDave Edwards.\nDear Mr. Jeremy,\nI wish to register a complaint.\nYO YR the onion selling their curries at \u00a31.10?\n\"The infamous \u00a31.10 curries\"\nDoesn't quite have the same ring to\nit, does it? [See how it glows, resting in the bowl]\nAre they going change them\nback to \u00a31 curries like in the ol'\ndays, or do I have to shut up?\nDave Edwards\n(Moaning ol' g it) ENERGY\nCONSERVATION??\nI would just like to ask those in\ns her field who think they are on an\nenergy efficiency drive why chemistry lecture theatre C has been\nconsistently heated to gas mark 6\nsince the beginning of term. It can't be the most energy efficient for\npeople to be sat in a lecture, with\nthe windows open, wearing only\nshorts and aT shirt and still feel\nlike you've been bann is he d to the\ncenter of a desert during a heat\nwave. My advise to them would be\nto fit thermostats designed for\nrooms rather than ones they nicked\nout of catering's ovens.\nP.A. Hickman (chem 3)\nWHOSE FELIX IS IT\nANYWAY?\nDear Jeremy,\nOn the front cover of Felix this\nyear you're describing it as \"The\nStudents' Newspaper at Imperial\nCollege\". I'm writing to say that I'm not really happy with this de scrip tion, for two reasons:\n1. By saying \"The Students'\nNewspaper\" it sounds like you're\nimplying there is only one student\nnewspaper at IC. This isn't the\ncase. There are of course all the\nCCU productions. Whatever your\nopinion of them (and some of\nthem are vastly superior to others),\nthey are newspapers produced\nfor and by the students of Imperial\nCollege. [This is the hack y and/or\npretentious argument. My real concern follows below]\n2. By saying \"The Students'\nNewspaper AT Imperial College\"\nyou're not making it clear where\nthe funding for the paper comes\nfrom. I'm sure many people will\ntake that as meaning IC directly\nfund the paper, which is not the\ncase as far as I know - it says inside\nFelix that it is \"produced for and on\nbehalf of Imperial College Union\nPublications Board\". Now that all\nthe clubs and societies are being\nforced to (quite rightly) state that\nthey are clubs of Imperial College\nUNION, I don't feel it's right that\nthe main publicity item produced\nby the Union doesn't.I know Felix\nis free of Union control in that\nyou're allowed to say \"The Union is\nshit\" if it is, but it is still funded and\nhoused by the Union and this\nshould be made clear.\nI apologise to anyone reading\nthis who thinks I'm a sad old hack\nwho needs to be shot. I just feel\nthat we (the Union) needs to make\nclear what we own. Stating our\nownership and our commit t ment to the provision of a sen/ice may\nstop us from losing that service.\nWe don't have another bookstore,\nand we can't afford to lose anything\nelse. College is very unlikely to ever\ntry to shut down Felix, but the principle still applies.\nYours sincerely,\nHelen-Louise Windsor\nPhysics PG\nDear Helen,\nI spent a lot of time over the\nsummer considering this byline\nand I'm glad you brought up the\n7\nsubject.\nYour first point is\neasy to answer - Felix is\nthe only cross-college\nnewspaper.\nThe second point is more\ncomplex. In many universities,\nthe newspaper is directly\naccountable to the union and\noften the college. The editor may\nprint only what they see fit, and\nis often a Union Officer them-selves. I want to stress that Felix\nis not controlled by the Union or\nthe College, but by the students -hence \"The Students' Newspaper\" (notice the position of the\napos trophy). It is true that\naround half our funding comes\nfrom the Union, but we could\nhardly call Felix \"The Students'\nNewspaper of Imperial College\nUnion, JP Morgan, British\nAerospace, SBC Warburg...\" I don't really care where the\nmoney comes from - it's the contents that are important. Your\nlast point, though, is spot on.\nEd\nOOPS...\nDear Felix,\n1 am afraid that you have been\nsignificantly mislead by the\nCollege's published Financial\nStatements. The graph you showed\nlast week which showed a loss of\n\u00a379,000 by Conferences for\n1995/96 does not reflect the real\nvalue that is created by the\nConference Office as most of the\noperating surplus falls into the\naccounts of the Residences and\nCatering operations.Your estimate\nfor 1996/97 is wrong, on the same\nbasis it would be \u00a338,000 positive.\nFor the year to 31 July '97, the net\nincome after all costs, for conference activities exceeded\n\u00a3750,000. This contribution has\nmore than doubled in the last two\nyears and is being ploughed back\ninto the fabric of the College,\nincluding the re fur b of Evelyn\nGardens and new furniture for the\nJCR . I am aware that the presentation of the accounts in this manner is most unhelpful but we are\nconstrained in our accounting\ntreatment by the Funding Council\nso to avoid such misunderstandings in the future, we are omitting\nthe relevant page from the forthcoming Financial Statements.\nNothing sinister in this honest.\nBest wishes\nMike Hansen\nDirector of Finance\n\n"
