Too much spare time over the long summer\nmonths? Why not sit back and stimulate your brain with the\nPUZZUES & GAMES PAGE\nWinning Ways by Elwyn Berlekamp, John\nConway and Richard Guy.\nIn many ways this is an unnecessary review.\nThose of you who read Martin Gardner's column in Scientific American will already be\nfamiliar with the name of John Conway. You will already have met his astonishing gift for\nusing and explaining high-powered maths as if\nit were a child's plaything, and you will want\nthis book. Those of you who do not read\nMartin Gardner will not know what I am\ntalking about, but will not be interested in the\nbook anyway.\nIn fact it is actually two books. Volume One\nis subtitled 'Games in General' and set up a formal mathematical system which may be\nused to analyse virtually any game which is\nsusceptible to analysis. The authors begin by\nsetting up a series of axioms which define a game, and in the first half of Volume One\n('Spade-work') they show how to analyse\ngames which obey the axioms. 'Change of\nHeart' then shows how the analysis can be\nmodified if some of the axioms are relaxed.\nThe second volume goes on to show how the\ntechniques of Volume One can be applied to\n'Games in Particular' and it too is divided into\ntwo sections:' Games in Clubs' which concentrates on competitive games, and 'Solitaire Diamonds' which includes not only a prodigious range of puzzles including several\nwhich were set as Scaramouche puzzles over\nthe last two years, but also all kinds of other\nmathematical curiosities which didn't fit in\nanywhere else.\nThe mathematics concerned (particularly in\nVolume One) is not to be taken lightly. Part of\nthe reason this review is in the post grad FELIX is that most undergrads will find it rather too\nheavy going; not that any specific mathematical knowledge is required, just that\ncurious clear headed precision which mathematicians call mathematical maturity\nand everyone else calls pedantry (if they're\nbeing polite). But if this doesn't deter you, the\nbook is a winner, in more ways than one.\nJust to give you a taste of the contents,\nsome of the more familiar games analysed\ninclude nim, dot sandboxes, nine men's morris, hex, go m oku( like noughts and\ncrosses, but get five in a row on an infinite\nboard) fox and geese, and (encroaching on my\nbrother's review) the de Bono L game. The\npuzzles section takes on solitaire, soma, a great variety of metal puzzles of the type\nmade popular by Pentangle, all the piano\nshifting puzzles ever set in the Scaramouche\ncolumn, and a certain puzzle which org in a ted in Hungary\nAs the maths is rigorous and precise, so is\nthe style of the book light and informal, almost\nto the point of childishness. The author's determination to illustrate every single point\nwith a joke, pun, silly drawing or mnemonic is\nsometimes very funny, sometimes astonishing\nand occasion ll y irritating.\nMy favourite game in the book is Phutball\nand I strongly recommend you to go to a bookshop and memo rise the rules of this\nexcellent game. Here, though, is the book's description of Dodgem, a game which has\nalready fascinated many of the FELIX staff.\nmitt off\nttt \u2022\n\u2022oo Black \"Colin Vout invented this excellent little game\nplayed with two black cars and two white ones\non a3 x3 board, starting as in the diagram. The\nplayers alternately move one of their cars one\nsquare in one of the three permitted directions\n(E,N or S for Black; N,E or W for White)\nand the first player to get both of his cars oft\nthe board wins. Black's cars may only leave\nthe board across its right-hand edge and White's cars only leave across the top edge.\nOnly one car is permitted on a square, and you\nlose if you prevent your opponent from\nmoving.\"\nWinning Ways is published by Academic\nPress at \u00a321.60 (ouch!) in paperback or \u00a363 in\nhardback. It's in stock at IC Bookshop, and I 'll\nbe recommending it to the Union book buyer.\nMartin S Taylor\nThe L Game by de Bono Games of\nWindsor, \u00a34.95\nThe L Game was invented in the mid-sixties by\nEdward de Bono; to meet a challenge to\nproduce a game which has both the simplicity\nof noughts and crosses and the strategic skill\nof chess.\nThe area of play consists of a square board\nof sixteen squares. Each player has one Lshaped piece and there are two neutral pieces.\nOn each turn, a player must move his Lpiece to a new position, and then may move\none of the neutral pice s. Play alternates until\none player has no legal move. This player is the\nloser.\nVariations on this theme include Gold\nand Silver which involves finding two squares secretly selected by your opponent\nwhilst he attempted to find yours. Added value\nis a similar game in which each player secretly\nassigns values to certain squares, and a predetermined total has to be reached, a player\nscoring points each time his L piece covers the\nsquare his opponent has valued.\nI found the game absorbing and entertaining,\nthe game being as involved and as skilful as the\nplayers want to make it.\nSince the game is easy to make from\ncardboard, the price of \u00a34.95 seems a little\nhigh. Nevertheless the game is well made from\nbrightly coloured plastic and heavy duty board\nand for those who enjoy the added satisfaction\nof playing on a neatly presented set, the game\nis excellent value.\nJeremy (Oh my God not another) Taylor\nPINCCCHIC\nA simpler puzzle this issue. I want you to find\nthe largest number possible using only four\nthrees. Only powers, multiplication, division,\nsubtraction and addition can be used (eg 3 to\nthe power 333 is permissible, but co sh(3333) is\nnot). If you're not above 10 to the power 100,\nyou're not really trying. No need to evaluate\nit\u2014just leave it in the four threes form. Good luck everyone!\nSolutions, comments and criticisms to me at\nthe FELIX Office, please. There is a prize of \u00a35\n(donated by Mend-a Bike) for the correct\nentry randomly selected at 1:00pm on\nWednesday.\nLast Week's Solution\nNorman arrived first, then Len, Michael, Peter\nand finally Oliver. Out of four correct solutions, Patrick O'Hara, Department of\nManagement Science, was the winner of the\n\u00a35.\nScar a mou che tells me that his final problems from the last FELIX of the summer\nterm are now all solved. Several people solved\n'Letters & Figures' and 'Sporting Chance' and\nTim Pigden of Man Sci and Ken Morison of\nChem Eng were selected as the respective\nwinners.\nThe other two puzzles were each solved by\nonly one person, so congratulations summa\ncum laude to GS Girolami of Chemistry and\nSimon Morrow of Maths who solved the chess\npuzzle and the furniture shifting respectively.\nAll of the above four win \u00a310, and all the prizes\nwill be available for collection from the\nafternoon of Monday, September 6.\nThere isn't much point giving the solutions\nyet, since they'll only have to be repeated\nwhen the undergrads come back, so I 'll keep\nyou in suspense till then; but if you really can't stand it, the solution to 'Holding the Baby' is in\nWinning Ways, which is reviewed in the games\nreview elsewhere in this issue.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board, and is printed by (be Union Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB.

    "content": "This week FELIX presents a special feature on the forthcoming science fiction epic\nBlade Runner, the latest project from Alien director Ridley Scott.\nThe film is set in the near future and represents a major departure from the current\ntrend in science fiction movies. It is based on a well known science fiction novel and\nhas already been heralded as a return to an adult treatment of the subject.\nVisually, it may also present a frightening and definitive vision of the city of the\nnext century.\nThe year is 2020. Four rogue androids \u2014\ngenetically engineered beings which are\nvirtually identical to humans\u2014have brutally\nmurdered a space shuttle crew and inexplicably\nreturned to earth, where \"replicants\" are\noutlawed. Rick Deckard, former BladeRunner, is called on to resume his old profession and track down these killers in the\noverpopulated and polluted confusion of Los\nAngeles.\nThe Blade Runners of the title are basically\nbounty hunters who are trained to detect and\neliminate any replicants found on earth (this is\ncalled 'retirement' rather than murder). The\nreason for this is simple: the androids are near\nperfect copies of human beings, the only\ndifference being a built-in four year lifespan\nand a lack of emotions. Apart from this they\nare of at least equal intelligence and greater\nstrength and when they realise their peculiar\nposition in society (one of virtual slavery) they\nrebel against their creators with un control able violence. Hence they are banned on earth and\n(being expendable) they are left to spearhead\nthe dangerous colonisation of outer worlds.\nTo add to the inherent dangers, these\nparticular androids are highly advanced Nexus\n6 models, who are believed to be capable of\ndeveloping emotions. The Blade Runner's primary detection tool is the Voight-Kampff\ntest\u2014a sort of glorified lie detector which\ngauges the level of em pathi c response to a set\nof ques to in s \u2014 and so partially developed\nemotions make detection extremely difficult.\nThe film is firmly based on Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,\nwhich is regarded by many science fiction fans\nas the definitive android story. It took Rick\nDeckard and pitched him against six androids,\nRutger Hauer as Roy Batty\nwhich were essentially flesh and blood human\nbeings, apart from the fact that they were\ngenetically engineered rather than born. In the\nbook he falls in love with one female android\nand grows increasingly disillusioned with his\njob. It deals, very effectively with man's response to his own creation which is basically\none of segregation, fear and repulsion.\nHampton Fancher and David Peoples wrote\nthe screenplay for the film. To adapt the book\nfor a big screen treatment they have left the\nbones of Dick's novel and created an equally\nchallenging and serious film. When Dick himself saw the final screenplay he was\nreportedly ecstatic, but he tragically died in\nFebruary prior to the film's release.\nBlade Runner is set in the near future and,\nunlike the book, it has an overpopulated city\nfor its location. The streets teem with life and\nthe predominantly Asian community fill the\nstreets in a never-ending stream of noise and\nconfusion. The opening shot gives a panoramic overview of the polluted city;\nmassive towers belch enormous flames above\nthe hundred storey apartment blocks. In the\ndistance we see two massive pyramids which\ndisrupt the skyline. These are the headquarters of Tyrell Corporation who create the\nreplicants for off-world use. The camera slowly\nadvances to these buildings and we see\nHolden, another Blade Runner, screening workers believed to be replicants who have\ninfiltrated the organisation. He discovers one,\nbut not soon enough to save his life.\nFor this reason Deckard is transported back\nto police headquarters in a spinner( a marvellous flying car) and sent after the four\nNexus 6 replicants by his redneck boss Bryant\nwho refers to the replicants as \"skin jobs\".\nHarrison Ford stars as Deckard and is\nformed into a sort of Philip Marlowe character.\nTraces of this homage to the film noir style\n(typified by The Big Sleep) become more\napparent as the film progresses. Ford narrates\nat several points: \"They don't advertise for\nkillers in the newspapers. That was my job,\" he\nslurs in his opening shot. He is sent to the\nTyrell Corporation to find out more about the\nNexus 6 from its creator, who insists that he\ntrys the Voight-Kampff test on his assistant\nRachael to see if it works on a human. After\nhundreds of questions Deckard finds that she\nis a Nexus 6 herself, but in the process he falls\nfor the beautiful girl.\nRachael, played by Sean Young, is a beautifully groomed young lady who is styled\non the Ingrid Bergman/Lauren Bacall heroin.\nDoubting the results of her test she per sues Deckard and reveals a series of artificially\nimplanted memories\u2014she is an experiment for\nTyrell who has not revealed to her that she is\nin fact a replica nt. Deckard then sets out to retire the four\nrogue androids and the chief protagonist is\nintroduced. Roy Batty, played by Dutch star\nRutger Hauer, is the leader of the group. He is\na remarkably effective villain, whose bleached\nhair and distinctive smile are more than reminiscent of the late Robert Shaw in From\nRussia With Love. Hauer gives a gripping\nIn J. F. Sebastian's apartment Deckard approach\ntoys created by Sebastian for company and his\nbecomes a maze where Deckard is hunted by\nperformance as he works his way toward a confrontation with Tyrell himself. This powerful moment, as the creation meets\ncreator, is not the climax of the film but it\nopens all sorts of questions about the subject\nof androids.\nThe film finishes with Deckard pursue ing Batty and his lover Pris to the apartment of\nJ. F. Sebastian, one of Tyrell' s genetic engineers. This is a marvellous set full of eerie\nandroids which Sebastian has built as friends.\nThe apartment is located in The Bradbury\nBuilding, another obvious homage as the set is\nlifted from the classic Outer Limits episode\nThe Fiend with the Glass Hand (written by\nRay Bradbury).\nIn the half light of this building, Deckard as\nthe hunter becomes hunted in a stunning\nclimactic chase which displays Rutger Hauer's talent to the full.\nThe outstanding star of the film is still the city itself though, which was created by a team\nPage 6 FELIX, August 20, 1982\nnunn sn of highly talented people. The basic design\nwork was greatly influenced by Syd Mead, who\nis described as a \"futurist\". This has nothing to\ndo with a taste for strange music but is more\nconcerned with his work designing highly\nstylised vehicles for large motor companies.\nRidley Scott was not put off by the salary Mead\ndemanded ($1150 per day) and com misi one d him to design a convincing spinner flying car.\nMead read the script and naturally added\nbackgrounds to complement his designs.\nThese impressed Scott so much that he kept\nMead employed for eighteen months on all\naspects of the film's design.\nThe result is what Mead calls a \"retrofitted\"\nlook; he envisioned a world where existing\nitems were rarely replaced, but improved and\nadded to. This resulted in cars with all sorts of\nodd extras attached. More importantly the old\nreplica nt. The room is full of harmless genetic\nt. It has a wonderful fairy tale look, but soon\nbuildings at ground level were kept and merely\nbuilt on top of, using advanced lightweight\nmaterials. This resulted in the hundred storey\napartment buildings which tower above the\nolder streets.\nRidley Scott drew many of the street designs\nhimself (he studied at the Royal College of Art)\nand he took complete , almost obsessive\ncontrol of the whole project. This ranged from\nsupervising the effects and set construction to\nfilming and editing.\nAs a director Scott's main fault is that he\nputs little depth into his characters. This was\nfar more apparent in Alien, but worked surprisingly well in The Duellists. Here it works\nreasonably well and, although the Philip\nMarlowe narration is a little clich ed, it does add\ndepth to Deckard's character. The replicants\nare understandably enigmatic (after all they\nare supposed to be emotion less) but the film\nstill lacks totally convincing characters.\nOne thing that is thoroughly convincing is\nthe special photographic effects work, supervised by the long standing team of\nDouglas Trumbull and Matthew Yurichich.\nThey have an impressive list of credits ranging\nfrom 2001: A Space Odyssey and Silent\nRunning to Close Encounters. Trumbull was\nparticularly pleased that this was not just\nanother space film with lots of pretty star fields\nand he rose to the challenge of producing a set\nof interesting effects economically. Ridley\nScott insisted on a particular integrated look\nfor the film and Trumbull hired a team of\ntechnicians who provided just that.\nScott required a murky, smokey look for the\ncity itself. For the opening shot a marvellous\ncityscape was created (called Hades by the\ncrew) which was filmed through vapor is ed diesel oil to give the heavily polluted feel\nimmediately. It is difficult to believe that the\nmodel used was between four and eighteen\ninches tall and that the Tyrell pyramids were a mere five feet high.\nThe model spinner flying cars were extremely good, but unfortunately the full size\nversion was not integrated well with the effects\nwork. Even the continuous (and unexplained)\nrain in the city could not hide the obvious wires\nused to lift the full size spinners on take-off. As the spinners were the main link between the\nstreet and aerial scenes this is a great pity.\nRidley Scott himself despises the term \"effects film\", as he rightly insists that special\neffects should not be used just to prop up a weak story. In Blade Runner he knew what he\nwanted from the effects; the dark and smokey\nlook is deliberate as well as the flare and haloes\naround light sources( which makes the\nspinners look remark e bly like some of the\n(JFOs in Close Encounters). These were then\nsuccessfully blended with the live action and\nnever dominate the film.\nFor me the film had a few stumbling blocks\nwhich seemed odd, while not detracting from\nthe overall enjoyment. For instance, it was\neasy to accept the leaps in the story which\nbring the characters together but some of the\nbasic premises seemed a little shakey. For a start it is doubtful that genetic engineering will\nadvance sufficiently to produce such perfect\nandroids by 2020, less than forty years hence.\nIt therefore seemed pointless to fix a date in\nthe first place, as we could have managed\nperfectly well without. Admittedly Dick himself\nset the novel in 1992 (nobody's perfect) but he\nincluded a fairly plausible colony on Mars. The\nfilm goes much further in suggesting populated\nstar systems which is highly unlikely by 2020.\nConsidering that the film is aimed at an adult\naudience, the \"near future\" treatment seems\ninappropriate when it demands such a striking\nsuspension of belief. After all, good fiction\ntends to be based on reasonably believe able projections of the present, so why not avoid\nany obvious pitfalls if you can?\nPerhaps the most pleasing aspect of the\nwhole film is the honesty with which the main\ncharacter is dealt with. Those who go along\nafter hearing Harrison Ford's name expecting\nIndiana Jones vs The Androids will be\ndisappointed, as Deckard spends most of the\ntime being beaten up by his physically superior\nadversaries. He develops into a quiet and\nfallible anti-hero which suits the general feeling\nof the novel very well. Scott has avoided falling\ninto the trap of glamorizing his hero, which is a brave step considering the current trend in\nfilms.\nAlto gh ether then, Blade Runner is an\nimpressive achievement which succeeds on\nHarrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, Blade\nRunner (a policeman whose job is to \"retire\"\nany replicants found on earth). During his\npursuit of four Nexus 6 androids he begins to\nsym pathis e with these strange creatures.\nmany levels. It is both entertaining and serious\nand is presented with great visual style. The\nstory itself may not be to everyone's taste, but\nit is transferred to the screen in a convincing\nmanner which befits a film which may herald\nthe return of serious science fiction as a genre.\nIt is certainly more entertaining than the batch\nof shoot 'em up laser battles which have\nfollowed Star Wars and deserves a large\naudience with both confirmed sf and non sf\nfans alike.\nBlade Runner opens on September 9 at\nthe Warner West End.\nShort Notice\nJohn Mili us' Conan the Barbarian is\nreleased next week and attempts to transfer\nRobert E. Howard's famous character to the\nscreen (using Austrian muscle man Arnold\nSchwarzenegger in the title role).\nBefore any of you waste good money going\nto see this film, I should warn you that it is one\nof the biggest turkeys in years. There are few\nfilms I would walk out on, but this is one.\nMilius not only wastes a reasonable story,\nbut also throws away a promising villain in\nJames Earl Jones (who supplies the voice for\nDarth Vader). Most of the dialogue is stunted\nor nonsensical and even an impressive mechanical snake is thrown away.\nAvoid this one like the plague.\nMark Smith\nFELIX, August 20, 1982 Page 7\n\n"

    "content": "The Newspaper of Imperial College Union.\nThefts from the Union Building:\nWho's really to blame?\nSecurity in a building the size of IC Union is\nbound to be a problem, the more so since it\nis the responsibility of the Deputy President\nto prevent unauthorised access, and full-time Deputy Presidents are in short supply at\ntrie moment. Nevertheless, the other Union officers seem to be taking the matter very\nlightly to be able to cheerfully assert that\n\"...the Union Office is not as secure as it\ncould be\" ( Mary Freeman and Jen Hardy Smith, Letters). Why on earth not? The\nUnion Office houses amongst other things\nseveral electric typewriters, a duplicating\nmachine, a photocopier, all the Union records, a television set, a cupboard full of\nsilver trophies (which were stolen two years\nago) and keys to the rest of the Union Building. Surely when a room holds property which is so temptingly thi ev able it\nshould be made as secure as possible?\nMary and Jen continue their letter by\nasking \" What can you do when the hobby of\ncertain sections of the student community is\ncollecting keys and generally entering places?\"\nThis is rather like asking how the Health\nService can run efficiently when people keep\nfalling ill; a security system exists to stop\npeople entering buildings they aren't supposed to, not just to warn them away\nfrom somewhere they aren't allowed to go.\nIf intruders do get in, whether serious\nburglars or students out for a joke, it shows\nthe security system is not as tight as it should\nbe.\nIn a College such as IC, students are\nbasically honest, inquisitive and mischievous\nand it is part of their nature\u2014a part which\nsound scientific training should encourage\u2014\nto inquire, investigate and experiment to\nfind ways round the problems they set\nthemselves. If they want to get into a locked\nbuilding (and many of them will try) it\nshould be regarded as a test of the building's security staff whether they succeed, and not\nas symptomatic of the rebellious and anarchic mentality which Mary and Jen\nseem to suppose.\nMuch of the blame for the lack of security\nlies with the ex-Deputy President Barney\nMcCabe. He made little secret of his hobby\nof 'collecting keys and entering places' and\nwell appreciated the problems of security in\nthe Union Office. To this end he invested a considerable amount of Union money in a new set of AS S A locks with blanks which\nwere not easy to copy. He then fitted these\nnew locks to most of the doors in the Union Office. Most? Yes, his typical inefficiency (or\nlaziness) stopped him completing his job,\nwith the result that students with keys to the\nold locks were still able to enter the Union Office to steal Mike. Now, because of general laxity, several keys to the new locks\nare missing, and security is as bad as ever. In\nfact, it is even possible to get into the Union Office without keys at all if you have the\nnecessary knowledge, effrontery and luck.\nIn case you've got the impression that I condone the breach of security to steal\nMike \u2014 I do! As I said in my last editorial I find it very funny that someone had the wit\nto highlight the Union's failings so humorously, and can't bring myself to\ncondemn the theft of an object which exists\nspecifically as a challenge to potential thieves. But I do hope the Union staff make\ntheir office more secure before less frivolous\nintruders intrude.\nTrying the soft sell\nWhen the idea of moving the Union to\nSouthside was first mooted, cautious optimism seemed to be in order. Premises in\nSouthside are underused, and it is in everyone's advantage to have the Union situated as near to the main Halls of Residence as possible. Plans had been drawn\nup after long consultations with a responsible Union President, and despite\nprotests from certain factions who hold a strong sense of tradition (notably my two\npredecessors) it seemed that the Union could\nwell benefit from such a scheme.\nBut College's attitude is changing. Right\nfrom the start John Smith has been holding\nhis cards close to his chest. The move was\nproposed last March, but the plans were not\nrevealed to the student body until the very\nend of May, shortly before the end of term\nand certainly not allowing enough time for\nsufficient debate on the matter before\nundergraduates went home for the long vac.\nIt was then revealed that for the move to\ntake place in September 1983, the Union would have had to approve the plans by the\nend of this coming October, only a few\nweeks after undergraduates had reassembled.\nCaution began to harden into suspicion.\nNow the suspicion is turning to distrust.\nCollege is trying a different tack. Plans for\nthe move have been shelved for the time\nbeing while college offers more facilities in Southside; very generous, but we should still\nbe wary of their motives. In a year or so, if\nMr Smith points out to a different Exec that\nsince we have so many Union activities\nbased in Southside it might benefit us to\nmove the whole Union there, it will be as\nwell to remember the methods that were\ntried the first time, and to examine the\noptions very carefully.\nWho's kidding\nwho?\nThe centre paragraph of Mary and Jen's let er has been dealt with above in some\ndetail; let us now consider the first\nparagraph and compare it with the last. The\nletter opens by berating FELIX for factual\ninaccuracies in the lead story last issue, and\nit cannot be denied that two specific details\nmentioned, although trifling and in con sequential, were reported wrongly. But how\ncan the Union have the cheek to criticise\nFELIX for this when two paragraphs later\nthey admit to spreading deliberate lies on the\nsame subject? It is the editorial policy of this\nnewspaper (now, at any rate) to report\nevents and happenings at IC as truthfully as\npossible. But what can you do when the\nhobby of certain sections of the Union staff\nis spreading rumours and generally misinforming people?\nFELIX News\nNot quite as many changes as I'd hoped in\nthis week's FELIX. The new cover isn't ready yet (unavoidable technical problems)\nand there is no sports news or What'sOn pages. The main change you'll probably\nnotice is the layout of the letters page; this is\nsomething I promised in my manifesto( those of you who remember it) but didn't have enough letters for last time. Making interesting layout isn't easy with a fixed\namount of material, and so in common with\nmost newspapers, I reserve the right to edit\nletters, or even not to print them at all in exceptional cases, although I 'll try to make\nsure this only happens rarely. And I also\nreserve the right not to correct grammar,\nspelling or punctuation in letters; if you\nwant to display your ignorance I'm not\ngoing to stop you.\nA special welcome to Peter Dawson, our\nnew printer, and the usual thanks since this\nissue would have been impossible without...\nNick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Steve, Steve, Peter,\nPeter, Mark, Pallab, Dave, Young Boy, Maz and anyone who turns up to collate.

    "content": "Hiccups\nin the\nUnion\nSir\nIt appears that since the new\nExec took office, there have been\nseveral 'hiccups' in the normally\nsmooth running of the Union,\nnot to mention a certain amount\nof bickering amongst sabbaticals j It strikes me, as an observer,\nthat this is entirely the fault of\nour new Hon Sec Miss Freeman.\nHaving come into the post with\nlittle experience of the higher\n(more rarefied) echelons of IC\nUnion affairs, she has made\nseveral unwarranted assumptions about the nature of a sabbatical's job and about the\ngeneral workings of the Union.\nShe has, very unfairly, assumed\nthat the object of the Union is to\npromote the welfare, and social\nlife of IC's students. This is not\nthe case. The object of the Union\nis to promote the welfare, and\nsocial life of IC Union's officers.\nIt is to provide a nice cosy little\noffice for pompous fools to sit in\nwhilst they think pompous presidential thoughts, whilst\ngazing adoring at their own\npicture on the wall. (Left-hand\nwall, half-way along). It is to\nprovide storage space for cricket\ngear, whilst the acting DP happily pretends his job consists\nof throwing darts at people's pictures, and the Union Building\nfalls apart.\nShe has assumed that a sabbatical's job is to co-ordinate\nand administer the Union, to\nwork to promote the interests of\nIC's students and to represent\ntheir views to College.\nOf course this is not so; any\nfool can* see that the job of a sabbatical is to bitch about other\nUnion officers, to work in one's own interest (if one has to work\nat all) and to represent College's views as Holy Writ (for further\ninfo ask Opsoc about this).\nShe has assumed that it is in\nthe interests of ICU to attempt\nto solve problems, disseminate\ninformation and to keep the\nwheels turning. It is not. The\ninterests of ICU are best served\nby drinking Mrs Ping ree's sherry, by getting ratted wherever\npossible, and keeping the\nstudents as much in the dark as\npossible.\nIt is essential that she be\nstopped before irreparable damage is done to the Union's reputation. With a few more\nmonths of her trouble making, who knows? The Union may end\nup making a decision in its\nmembers' best interest or, God\nforbid, even take action on such\na decision.\n'Eric' Jarvis\nPS: For Christ's sake, not only\nis she a woman, she's not in any\nof the tie clubs: how can she be\nexpected to know anything?\nIt's a Vet's Life\nDear Martin\nIn reply to Jon's letter in the\nlast issue of FELIX, I must say\nthat I too was shocked by the\nrevelation that we have had an\nimposter in the Union Office, but\nsurely it should be future Presidents that are positively vetted?\nYours sincerely\nMary Freeman\nICU Hon Sec\nPS: As regards my positive\nvetting I believe he has already\nintimated elsewhere that this is\ndefinitely not necessary in my\ncase.\nPPS: Why does he not want to\noffer his services for the task?\nBloodbath\nin\nBeruit\nDear Sir, Peace be Upon You,\nIt is clear from their continued\ncampaign of genocide against\nthe civilian population of Beruit\nthat the Jews have a callous\ndisregard for human life, except\nthat is their own!

Prices have\nbeen raised for the vacation and\nwill be reduced again when term\nstarts. This means that IC students who remain during the\nvacations, mostly PG s, are\ndiscriminated against.\nAssuming that the union doesn't implement discriminatory policies for the sake of it, I can see two possible but unsatisfactory reasons for this.\nIt is obviously a good idea to\nraise prices to rip off tourists,\nbut this policy also rips off IC\nstudents. If this is the reason it\nshould be possible to find a way\nround it by having one price for\nstudents and another for tourists.\nIf there are fewer customers\nduring the vacation it could be\nargued that each customer should pay more. It would be\nmore appropriate for customers\nin term and vacation to pay the\nsame price,-one which would\nmake the bar viable in the year.\nIt is ridiculous to calculate\nprices in term time on the\nassumption that the bar will\ndiss appear along with all its\noverheads when the vacation\ncomes and then charge a higher\nprice out of term. Responsibility\nfor the bars existence out of term\nshould be shared between all its\ncustomers and not foisted arbitrarily onto one section of\nthem.\nYours sincerely\nPaul Kirkman\nPhysics PG Page 4 FELIX, August 20, 1982\n\n"

    "content": "Founded in 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\n\u00a31m COMPUTER FOR ICCC?\nImperial College Computer Centre (ICCC) is hoping to replace one of\nits two existing computers with a new machine within the next two years.\nThis announcement follows\nthe replacement last year of one\nageing computer by a more up-to-date machine of equivalent\npower. It is the very high' demand placed upon the Centre's current system that has prompted\nthis move. During term time I CCC can expect to process\n5,000 small jobs and around\n2,500 larger ones each week. In\naddition, over 200 users may be\nsimultaneously logged-in to the\nsystem at peak hours.\nThe Centre is looking for a computer that would enable\nI CCC to run bigger interactive\njobs than are currently possible,\nthus opening up new possibilities\nfor developments and applications. But all interactive users,\neven those who only run small\njobs, will benefit from the\ninstallation of a new machine,\nArthur Spirling, the Computer\nManager behind the deal.\nsince it is expected that any\nreplacement would have twice\nthe throughput capability of the\nold machine.\nThe cost of the computer will\nbe met by the Computer Board\nof the Department of Education\nand Science who have already\napproved the purchase of a new\nmachine in principle.\nThe computer room at present. The terminal being studied is linked to\nthe Cyber 170/720, the machine which would be sold if the deal goes\nthrough. Photo: Dave W Parry\nHigh-rise Flats\nA20% rent rise for the Southside Penthouse flats was pushed through\nat the end of a long meeting of Student Residence Committee by ex-Senior Warden Dr Don Monro. This was in spite of a maximum 4% rise\nin any other rents.\nThe penthouse flats, the subject of much controversy since they\nfirst became available, are now priced at \u00a3120p cm per head for a four\nperson flat. This compares with about \u00a380 for premises in Fulham,\nand around \u00a3100 for Head Tenancy flats. The rises resulted from a survey in which prospective residents, when being interviewed, were\nasked if they would pay \u00a3140p cm, and since none raised objections, it\nwas suggested that a20% rise was doing them a favour.\nThe new price rises brought heavy criticism from Council on ex-President Nick Morton, because there will be no chance to reverse\nthe decision since the Student Residence Committee does not meet\nagain till next term.\nSouthside Move:\nWe're Not Going\n(Yet!)\nThe controversial and much publicised Southside move has been\nshelved. The plan, had it been accepted, would have resulted in the\ntotal move of all the Union facilities from Beit to Southside,\nbeginning next July and continuing over the following year.\nNegotiations were begun last Feburary between John Smith, the\nCollege Secretary, and Nick Morton then Union President. Mr Morton kept very quiet about the whole thing and it wasn't until\nJune that knowledge of the proposed move was made widespread. A final yes or no answer was expected from the Union in the coming\nautumn term, and had the answer been yes the Union would have\nbeen committed to the move.\nRecent discussions between John Smith and Steve Goulder,\nhowever, indicate that College is now taking a very different attitude.\nThe current proposals are that the Union should take over and utilise\nsome of the space in Southside which College has no use for, whilst\nmaintaining all its facilities in Beit. A complete move is still open to\nnegotiation, and indeed it seems not unlikely that College will\neventually point out that if some of our facilities are in Southside we\nmay as well move everything across for greater convenience. But, this\nwould not be until next year or even the year after, and there is plenty\nof room for discussion.\nThe reasons for the change in plan are unclear at the time of going\nto press, but it seems likely that College has been influenced both by\nfinancial factors (the cost of a total move is now estimated at \u00a3'/2m, twice the original estimate) and by the outcry made by the Union at\nthe end of last term, which cast doubt on the possibility of the\nproposals gaining the approval of the student body.\nNo. 620 Friday, August 20,1982 Free!\n\n"

    "content": "(played by Harry To wb), the king of the\nbeggars. The work is both a great comedy and\na tragedy with great streaks of earthiness and\nbawdiness. However, the director, Richard\nEyre, has shifted the scene from the eighteenth\nto the nineteenth century. In so doing it\nbecomes an attack on Victorian hypocrisy in\nwhich the vices of the lower classes faithfully\nmirror those of the upper. Right at the\nbeginning of the play wench s lay out gas lights\nat the foot of the stage as if to put on a show.\nTHe central irony is then superbly enhanced:\nthat the rich are patronising an entertainment\nthat attacks their own values.\nThe songs in the production mellow magnificently with the words.

Gay spent most\nof his writing life struggling against poverty,\nand although the roughness of society's lowest\nWAIKABOUTLOOKSEE (I by Mobile Optics inc.\nI set off this week to visit several different\nexhibitions of pictures. Thought I, \"different\npeople get enthusiastic about different things,\nso I 'll see how broad a spectrum I can cover.\"\nThat was the theory but, before you read\nfurther, I'd better let you know I didn't make\nit...Why? Well, I started off at the British\nMuseum, at the exhibition ' A Century of\nModern Drawing', and became enthralled. I only left when they chucked me out. But I did\nmanage one extra titbit, on my way back to\nCollege\u2014I 'll probably get round to that in the\nlast paragraph!\nThe pictures at the British Museum are on\nloan from the Museum of Modern Art, New\nYork; by all accounts one of the greatest\ncollections of its kind in the world. The exhibition is set out more or less in chronological order, starting with drawings by\nSeurat and Cezanne from the end of the\nnineteenth century. These mark the turning\npoint from Impressionism and from the idea of\nan objective 'truth to nature'. Cezanne' s pictures say \" everything in nature is\nPablo Picasso's 'Head of a Man', a water\ncolour painted in 1907.\nclass is portrayed in all its nakedness and\ngrime, Ga y employs a light heart as a great aid\nto survival.\nOne of two productions of Uncle Vanya by\nChekhov currently on stage in London is at\nthe Theatre Royal Haymarket. This pro duc tion, directed by Christopher Fettes, can certainly boast about an all-star cast: Donald\nSinden, Frances de la Tour, Sheila Gish, Bill\nFraser, Ronald Pickup, Margaret Rawlings,\nFreda Jackson and Harry Andrews.\nThe whole play takes place in the 1890s in a country estate belonging to Professor Sere bri a kov( Harry Andrews), a retired professor of art. There is little plot as such but\nthe brill an cy of the play lies in its very\nperceptive analysis and exploration of human\nidleness. Chekhov's had a medical training and\nmany of his short stories and plays display a scientific curiosity about details of human\nrelationships as well as a doctor's compassion\ngeometry\", and from this start the new\nmovement of Cubism developed. In transferring a3D object onto a two-dimensional piece\nof paper, the Cubists produce a sort of\ntransparent cross-section: the object is split up\ninto basic geometric shapes which support and\nintersect each other. You find yourself looking\nat the relation between them, wondering if the\ngeometric scaffolding is about to fall down and,\nas you look, the distinction between the\noriginal object, which has become an architectural construction, and the space in\nwhich it is standing, disappears.\nAn extra dimension, that of time, is also\nintroduced: in one picture several different\nviewpoints appear together, as if you, the\nobserver, are not standing still, but walking\nround the object and looking at it from\ndifferent angles. Picasso is the name that\nsprings to mind in this context, and many of\nhis drawings are on show.\nPushed to its logical conclusion (or to its\nincomprehensible extreme, depending on how\nyou feel about it!) Cubist theory leads to\ncompletely abstract forms. Recognisable\nfigures and objects are not used, even for\ninspiration. The picture is the fruit of the\nartist's imagination and expresses a state of\nmind or a feeling. The attempt to express the\ninvisible, intense world of imagination has\nproduced many weird and some wonderful (?!)\nresults. For example, a collage of freely floating\n.pale blue squares! No line here, just the\ntension between the planes and the bare paper\nand the edges of the picture. Or a line-, again\ncompletely nonobjective, which moves around so energetically that it leaves black\nblobs all over the page. This art avoids, even\nrejects, all the visual stimuli of everyday life.\nWhat is the point, other than entertainment?\nThe only way I can appreciate it and try to\nunderstand it, is by seeing it as a reaction to\nmaterialistic society\u2014I think its message is\nthat man is not only matter, but is, above all,\nmind and feeling.\nNot all the drawings, by any means, are\nwholly abstract. Many of the artists explore\nthe connection between imagination and the\nreal world, and there's a fascinating section of\nsurrealist art. The surrealists tried to express\nthe subconscious in visual terms and their\ndrawings and photo-collages have the same\ntinge of irrationality and unreality that colours\na dream or a fairy tale.\nGive yourself plenty of time to enjoy it\u2014this\nexhibition is an experience, as well as the\ncream of a great collection.\nAnybody living in the post grad Hall in\nMontpelier Place? Well, just across the road is\nCheval Place, and at number 25 the Wraxall\nGallery is having a summer exhibition. For\nthose of you not acquainted with the\nbackstreet s of Knightsbridge, I recommend an\nand understanding. Uncle Vanya treads a fine\nbalance between comedy and tragedy. The\nprofessor's household is as crowded and\nstifling as a small fish bowl. All the characters\nrepresent varying forms of idleness, the laziest\nbeing that of Uncle Vanya (Donald Sinden)\nwho complains about the professor's scribbling s on art as \"twenty years of nothing\".\nThe professor causes such resentment in the\nhousehold, but the irony of course is that the\nold man is not idle but busy and hard working\nand, most importantly, with a light in the\ndistance to work towards, even if his work\ndoes add up to little.\nMuch of the cho j cest acting comes from\nRonald Pickup, playing the country doctor\nMikhail Lvovich Astrov. In fact he seems\nalmost the central character in the play, so\nmuch so that the play ought to be called not\nUncle Vanya but Mikhail Lvovich Astrov! An excellent production, it is well worth seeing.\nNick Bedding\nA to Z! Five artists are exhibiting; all, loosely,\ninspired by the countryside. The paintings are\nin a completely different league from the\ndrawings at the British Museum, but certainly\nworth a visit, and it's interesting to see what\nsells well. Most of Malcolm Ash man's watercolours have little red dots beside them\n(NB red dot = red sticky label, approx 1cm in\ndiameter, stuck to wall beside picture; indicates that picture has been sold!). He\npaints romantic characters in formal gardens\nor symbolic settings, with some delightful\nquirks: 'Red Hat' is decorated with cherries;\nbright kingfishers hover and dart around 'Green Hat'. Ann Arnold paints mysterious\ncorners of English countryside in delicate\npastel colours. Prices range from \u00a330 for\nwatercolours to almost \u00a33,000 for large oil\npaintings I didn't much care for.

That was rather a pity, I thought, because I was looking forward to this\nplay which met with \"the universal detestation\nof town\" on its first night in 1732 (it was\nwithdrawn after the first night), and had \"an\naccident ridden first night\" when aired 236\nyears later in 1968.\nA pregnant Mary Freeman and the grief-stricken moose as ghosts in the play-within-a play. Photo: Dave W Parry\nNext followed The Wire Guided Review\ncontaining no less than twenty sketches. The\nfirst, rather unfunny, sketch took place in what\nseemed to be an asylum canteen (if there is\nsuch a place), but the second sketch was\ndefinitely amusing. This was a 'This is Your Life' show but one in which the guest's most\nunpleasant an un savoury aspects of his life\nwere chronicled by a sort of ' God the Father'\ntype figure. A bizarre 'father and son' sketch\nfollowed between the versatile Pallab G ho sh and Duncan Bateson, whose very expressive\nface and voice that carries very well is a real\nasset to the group. Duncan appeared in the\nnext sketch where he was transported to the\nLand of Infinity to seek fundamental truths and\nthe Marino Isheep. There next followed something perfectly ludicrous: Pope John Paul\nII and an assortment of priests, nuns and\nmonks were boogieing to his words using on\nhis trip to tn is country (this is the sort of thing\none imagines the Papal team would do after a particularly hard Papal visit). A policeman\nsketch and a party policy game led up to\nIan Forrester, this is your life.\nperhaps the best sketch, a lecture by a professor on his long, rambling and elaborate\nthesis about smoking, love-making and cancer,\ndelivered brilliantly by the talented Mike Pickup. A bus-stop sketch led straight on to a song by 'Eric' Jarvis. Although a talented\nguitarist and songwriter he has a voice like a grief-stricken moose. Dave Wheatley and Mike\nPickup then played two 'arty' intellectuals who\nachieved a glorious piece of self-hypocrisy.\nAnother song followed by the grief-stricken\nmoose, and then a horrifying vision of\nThatcherism taken to its extreme in a pay\noffice where Chris Pickup (brother of Mike\nPickup) is told the company has decided not to\npay him that day and instead of groaning he\n\"ought to be bloody well grateful you've still\ngot a job\". A hilarious sketch by the Dave\nWheatley/ Mike Pickup team on two policemen attempting to philosophize gave\nway to a sketch involving a very long railing.\nVarious eccentrics were chaining themselves\nto the railing: a fanatical adherent of\nO'F l anna gan's molecular theory, a man concerned about the absence of elderly and\ninfirm tadpoles, and a member of the SDP. 'Eric' Jarvis then played a vicar at his pulpit\ndelivering a sermon on the biblical evidence for\nChrist's proclivity for the bottle. Territorial\ncivil servants followed, and then an attack on\nthe DHS S. The last sketch was different to all\nthe others: each member of the company\nmentioned a current 'injustice' in this country\nto which the whole company replied sarcastically \"This is British democracy.\" This\nsketch jarred with the spirit of the rest of the\nreview and should be thrown out. In any case it\nwas quite incorrect.\nThe team have certainly succeeded in being\ndifferent from the old footlights tradition and\nNot the Nine O 'Clock News, etc and with\nsome polishing up of timing and the order of\nthe sketches should make a very witty\nevening. I wish them luck at the Festival, but\nperhaps most importantly, that they have a good time themselves.\nThe Winter's Tale by Shakespeare;\nThe Prince of Homburg by Heinrich\nvon Kleist; The Beggar's Opera by\nJohn Gay; Uncle Vanya by Chekhov\nWilliam Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale at\nthe magnificent new Barbican Theatre is a romantic tragedy about the vagaries of Time.\nLeontes, King of Sicilia (Patrick Stewart)\nsuspects his wife Hermione (Gemma Jones) of\nadultery with their friend King Polixenes of\nBohemia (Rag Jewers). He asks his servant\nCamillo (Bernard Lloyd) to poison his friend,\nbut Camillo is convinced of Poli xen es' innocence and they flee together to Bohemia.\nLeontes has Hermoine imprisoned and casts\ntheir new-born daughter into the wilderness.\nAt Hermione's trial the Delphic oracle of\nApollo declares that she is innocent and Leontes a tyrant, who will die without an heir if\nhe does not recover his lost daughter. Almost\nimmediately their son Hamillius dies, and Hermione collapses in grief, apparently dead.\nThe abandoned daughter is found and cared\nfor by a shepherd. Sixteen years pass and\nFlorizel, Polixenes' son falls in love with her\nand decides to marry her despite her humble\norigin. They flee with Camillo back to Sicily\nwhere the young girl's true identity is revealed\nto Leon tes. Leon tes and Poli xen es are\nreconciled, and Hermione is revealed by\nPaulina (Sheila Hancock) to be still living.\nThe Winter's Tale possesses strong elements of fantasy and magic but these are\nsadly un pronounced in this production by\nRonald Eyre. The stage is for the most part\nrather bare and austere, but the odd surprise\ndoes pop up now and then as when Geoffrey\nHutchings emerges as a cockney toast-master\nin a morning suit. In the first part of the play\nLeontes is in a state of mental turbulence, and\nin sudden outbursts voices his 'foul imagining s'. The sufferer is deluded yet half knows he\nis under a delusion, but Patrick Stewart's depiction is curiously un anguished and un moving. Barbican Theatre: a scene from the Winter's Tale.\nThe Prince of Homburg at the Cottlesloe\nTheatre, although written in 1811, seems\nincredibly modern. Its author, Heinrich von\nKleist, is one of the world's little-known\ngeniuses.\nEntirely without literary training, his eight\nstories are each astounding in concept and\nmiraculous in form. The Prince of Homburg\nwas his last play and it concerns a young\ncavalry officer torn between love and duty.\nThe production by John Burgess at the\nCottesloe is superb; it is strong, sleek and fast\nmoving, and every sentence and paragraph of\ndialogue is laudably concise and perfectly\nexpressive.\nAlso at the Cottesloe is The Beggar's Opera\nby John Gay. The set, and indeed, the whole\ntheatre, is highly atmospheric. As soon as one\nenters the large black box which is the\nCottesloe, one is confronted with a thick\nsmokiness through which on the stage one can\ndiscern a large old bridge and beneath it the\nmusty dark dwelling of the vagrants. This is the\nroosting place of beggars, criminals, tramps\nand cripples, who would return after a hard\nday's work obtaining money by underhand\nmeans.\nThe play revolves around Macheath (played\nby Paul Jones), a pimp playing a highway\ngangster, and his father in law Peach un Page 8 FELIX, August 20, 1982\n\n"
