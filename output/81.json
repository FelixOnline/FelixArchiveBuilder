    "content": "FELIX IG HT OF MINES GUILDS MEN?\" Throw Them Out!\" WHO SMASHED THE YARD? Friday October the 21st. saw that great annual\nfunction, which has been going on for many years,\nwhen the man of the H.S. M. welcome their new comrades In most fitting style which Is unequalled by\nany other college or mining school In the World.\nSTen those who cams away from the Dinner who were\nsober, and there were very few, thoroughly enjoyed\nthemselves.\nAs is usual on this occasion, hosts were meeting\ntheir fresher sup to an hour and a half before tha\ndinner was due to begin, and they than made haste\nto the Queen's Arms, or similar hostelry, keen to\ncommence the business of the evening. \"The Queen's\" was packed almost as tight as some of its occupants\nwere fated to become.\nShe Dinner began at 7.30 in the Ayrton Hall. It \u2022 was to go on for over two hours,during which time\nan excellent Mooney-produced meal,swilled down by\nvast quantities of bitter beer, and six sagacious\nspeeches were consumed. The President, Mr. Huckin,\nwas the first to spa ak after the Queen had been\ntoasted, and he rose to his feet to propose the\ntoast \"The Freshers\". Bus to the fact that FELIX\ncorrespondents are never really sober anyway, and\non this occasion definitely not so, we cannot re member what Mr.Huckin said - except something about\nClarwence, Horwace and the Zoo. All six speeches,\nas one would expect, consisted mainly of verbal\nmutual back-slapping. Mr.Doug Owen replied for the\nFreshers. In a stirring speech he righteously condemned \" that place along Exhibition Road with a doorway looking like tha entrance to a Public Lavatory.\" Mr. Owen then led his fellows in a toast\nto their hosts. At the end of his speech he was\naccorded tumultuous applause. Mr. Tony Werner, the\nVice-President, next rose to propose the toast\n\"The Royal School of Mines\". He examined the R.S. M. In the light of the past, the present, and the\nfuture, and gave some witty definitions regarding\nthe various professions within the mining industry.\nThe Head of the Mining Department, Professor Mltcheson than replied to this toast saying that he\nwas honoured that, he had been asked to do so considering that only a few years ago he had bean \" a fresher \" himself. Professor Mitcheson went on to\nspeak of the traditions of, and the benefits to be\ngained from the School. He spoke, too, of the high\nreputation of the School in the mining industry\nthroughout the World.\nThe last two speeches ware tha proposal of a toast\nto the Guests, by Peter Orialey, P.G. Mining Geology,\nand the reply, by Mr. H.H. Blyth, a lecturer in the\nMineral Dressing Department. Mr. Orimloy was rath mr rude to Messrs. Miller and Guthrie and pointed out to\nthe former that he now had the opportunity of seeing\nhow a fresher s< Jlnn\u00abr should be run.\nWith the speeches over, the company repaired to the\nBar and ejected those non-R. S.M.\"s cura\" who had not\nalready fled. But the President announced that the\nYard was not to be drunk on the Bar counter as is usual; it was to be drunk on the steps outside tho\ndoor of the Bar. Half way through these proceedings\none unfortunate gentleman, in swirling the Yard to\nprevent air lock, hit somebody's head three feet away.\nThis Jarred the rim of the funnel against the unfortunates teeth which were strong enough to chip\nthe glass. Tho Hon.Pornographer's Pot was substituted, a pint of ale being measured into it. It was\nnot quite clear to your reporters as to who won the\nYard, but the fresher s put up a very good show.\nThe company returned to the Bar proper as it neared eleven o 'clock. The previously ejected Guildsmen\nand R.C.S. were courteously permitted to coexist.\nAll were Joinad in merry songs, the names of which\nFKi.Il readers will have little difficulty in guess'^\u2022g. then the Bar closed there was an exodus to the\nadjoining lounge where Mr. Wallace, one of the two\nHonourable Pomographers, read the little bedtime\nstory of \"Eskimo Nell\" from the Mines Book. At this\nfinal stage in the proceedings Keith Miller began\nto complain bitterly that \"Nell\" had to be read from\na book and was not recited fr on s memory. This does\nseem to be rather a poor show and the only excuse\nthat comes to mind is that, after drinking the near-ly three pints of his full Pot in one fell swoop,\nthe Pornographor's memory may have become clouded\nover.\nFOUR FRESHMEN' S DINNERS IN GUILD'S Qteat Aucce&d of JVaw 3dm MORE NEXT YEAR? This year for the first time, City and Guilds College\nhad an official reception for their freshmen. There were\nfour fresher s dinners where each new man had an 'old hand'\nas his host. Guilds Union Freshers Dinner Committee are to\nbe eon gra tu&la ted on their extremely rapid and efficient\nhandling of the arrangement. It was no slight task to\ndesignate hosts, contact guests, prepare speeches, search\nfor stories (dean or otherwise), look to catering and beer\n(clean or otherwise!J) in the'space of only three days, but\nthe committee of twenty did their work well,\nKeith Miller, aa acting president of the College, had\nthe unenviable ta3k of making two speeches per dinner.\nThinking to enlighten his task by introducing a little\nnovelty, he wrote his speeches on toilet paper. This went\noff excellently far the first two occasions, but on the third\nnight the pri noi pal guest turned out to be a director of a rival toilet-paper firm.\nProfessor Ford not wishing to be scandal is ed by the\nstories of his past bought his piece of toilet paper at the\nprice of a2nd class degree. However The Dean in the\npresence of the fro-Reotar, on the following night was bla ok mailed more successfully, to the tune of a1 st. A main source of anxiety was whether one's fresher would\nthink that the evening's entertainment included free beer.\nSeveral people were overheard telling their protege s that it was the custom for the guest to pay for the host's drinks\nafter the dinner.\nThe singing of traditional songs in the bar was admirably led, after a few fa l3e starts, by Mr. Miller. After\nthe first verse of \"The Engineer\", more than a few startled\nfaces were observed. These, however, due to the atmosphere\nand the free beer, 30on disappeared, and we were o he ered to\nfind this year's first-year men just as good as last\nyear's. One em mine nt guest stayed in the bar drinking double\nwhiskies until 11.JO and paying for all the rounds. However\nthe night porter was a little bleary eyed by then and wishing\nto go to sleep was heard to says\n\"Now then move on out otherwise I will report you to the\nChairman of the C.&G. Board.\"\nThe reply was:\n\"My go-ooo ood man. Iam the Chairman.\" The Chairman\nwas last seen dancing down Exhibition Road.\nIt is sad to report that by Friday night K. Miller was\nslightly intoxicated after a week of ordeals and was confused\nwhen trying to distinguish several guests, however that night\nbrought to an end a very successful venture and the good\nsecretary Mr. Peter Harri3 laid Mr.\nhis bed to fall blissfully asleep.\nHowever he is in working order again and this week he\nhopes all hosts will pay up the remaining 22/- to their\ndepartmental reps so that the bills may be met. Jn in cr OUILDSMES, ARB W IK GOOD VOICK.'\nIN E TASTING The Wine Tasting Society, newly formed in the\nCollege, sent out invitations to Union Officials of all ranks and classes to \"partake in the tasting\nto be held in the new lounge on Friday 14th Oct.\nat 5.15 p.m.\" Mr. Ian Mackenzie, the well known\nwine importer, spoke on the subject of sherry. His\ntalk, as one would expect, was ex tre a ely well in formed and interesting, if a little dry.\nThe tasting of the wine began about an hour\nafter the meeting began, by which time a great and\ninsatiable thirst had been created in the listeners. Mr. Mackenzie answered questions on the wines and\ntheir uses, and when the meeting was brought to a close most people wanted more to taste.\nThe criticism which is levelled at the Society\norganizers is a matter of principle. There were\nmany invitations sent out, and no mention was\nna de of payment: But in order to taste the wine\neverybody had to pay two shillings.. If such\nremuneration was expected, patrons should have been\nr or warne a, It is bad taste on the part of the\nSociety. .\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX S \u00a3e& eK. is. the. Editor\nUniversity of London Union,\nMalet Street.\n18th, Ootober, 1955.\nDear Sir,\nI was very interested to read the spirited attack\nHade in \"Nelson's Column\" on U.L. U. Membership Cards.\nUnfortunately, \"Nelson\", seems to have slipped into one or\ntwo misapprehensions which X hope I may be allowed to\ncorrect.\nI think most people would agree that this costly\nand splendid building wh i oh is now U.L. TT.*s headquarters,\nshould be used mainly by those people for whom it was\nbuilt. Membership cards were issued not to prevent damage\nto the building by outsiders, so much as to ensure that\nthe facilities were used solely by members and their friends.\nIf the President's Council did not make every effort to\nensure this, I think they would be falling in their duty\nboth to the members and to the University who finance the\nbuilding. Without some attempt to control admission, the\nbuilding would be open to anybody who oared to walk in from\nTottenham Court Road. This would appear to be a reasonable\nprecaution rather then a \"Gestapo-like move.\"\n\"Nelson\" was, of course, right in answering his\nquestion \"What is wrong with the individual College Union\nMembership Cards?\" with \"The door keepers can't recognise\nthem.\" But this is only part of the real answer.\nCut of the 43 Colleges in U.L. U.,15 are Medical\nColleges and 13 Institutions with Recognised Teachers. In\npractically all of these a member of the College Union is\nnot necessarily a member of U.L. U.. Therefore, possession of\na College Union Cardgives no indication of the right to\nenter the new building. Of the 15 Colleges remaining, many,\nIncluding the three large ones, U.C., King's and L.S.E., do\nnot have membership cards at all.\nThus the number of Colleges in which the College\nUnion membership cards are issued and where College Union\nKenibership means the same as membership of U.L.U.i s very\nsmall. I.C. happens to be in the exceptionally fortunate\nposition. In view of these difficulties it vr as decided tb\nissue one standard card in the opening year and then to\nreconsider the position in the light of experience. It may\nwell be that some College cards (I.C.'a included) can be\naccepted at a later date.\n\u2022 \u2022 As to the cost of membership cards, this de or eases proportionately with the number printed. Since, for the same\nreasons given above, the Union had to print so many Union\ncards, tile extra cost of printing for the few Colleges such\nas I.C. was very small. Moreover, the importance of,a membership card from the publicity point of view cannot be\nunderestimated.\nI frankly am unable to see how the charge of stupid\nbureaucracy' can be justified. The charge, if made, should\nbe levelled at\u00abPresident's Council who accepted the proposal\nunanimously at their meeting on the 20th. June, 1955. This\nmeeting was attended by Mr. M. Neale, at that time, ft-e sident of the I.C. Union.\nYours faithfully.\nAlec Leaver\n(Hon. Secretary, University of London Union. )\n*\u2022 See Nelson's Column\nDear Sir, As one of the Quildsaen who were forcibly\nejected by hooligans on Mines Freshers' Night from\nthe bar, I was astounded to see the Mines pornographer READING a manuscript of \"Eskimo Nell\" to x he Mines\nFreshers, I feel that the Mines should be given a chance to regain their lost prestige in the College.\nI therefore challenge the Hon. pornographer to meet\nme in the bar on Friday 23th October at 7.00p.m., where an Impartial judge will select the better un-scripted rendering of this epic poem.

    "content": "4 FELIX Viewpoint^ YHE FIFTH In 1954 the Senate of the University of Lonr\ndon passed a resolution as follows:-\"... the Metropolitan Police ... are not prepared\nto give facilities for or protection to any procession or demonstrations on November 5th. A student who is found to have taken part in any form\nof procession on 5th. November next, or otherwise\nmisbehaved himself or herself, will be liable to\nappear before a College Board of Discipline ....\nAny student ... who takes part in such activities is liable to be sent down ... either temporarily\nor permanently\".\nThis is the second successive year that students of the University have been issued with a stern ruling from. Senate House. It has been brought\nabout by deeds of hooliganism caused by a few ir responsible people who treat a large gathering of\nstudents as a cover to acts of wanton and unnecessary damage. The climax was reached in1953 when\non November 6th. Bow Street Magistrates' Court was\nthe scene of a continuous procession of students\nappearing for their \"crimes\" of the preceeding\nevening.\nLETS PLAY AT\nBEING GOOD BOYS\nTHIS YEAR\nThe students of Imperial College, fully aware\nof the foundations on which the Senate based their decision, accepted their ruling and provided their own amusement on the sports field at Harlington.\nFor some years Harlington has provided an outlet\nfor Kov. 5th but last years effort was carried\nout on a grander side, in order to keep our students from trespassing on the newly formed Senate\nlaws. The Entertainments committee in conjunction\nwith the Athletio clubs committee arranged a colourful evening's entertainment of dancing and\nfire v.cr ks in the midst of which helpings of barbecued pig were served.\nThe ban, since this year, now covers all forms\nof external and inter-colle g* ate rags. Other Univ ers i ties are allowed their Charity Rags: the lord Kayor has his procession; and much nearer home,\nGuild's runs its Field Cup race. It was noticeable\nthat the intervention of the police acted as an\nincentive and not a dsm per on the latter occasion.\nBut this is by-the-by. The question which\nstudents ask is \"Is this just?\".\nFIRST I.C. UNION MEETING THIS YEA K Jim Anderson speaks about November 5th. The first I.C. Union meeting of the year wan\nheld in the large Chemistry lecture theatre at\n1.15 on October 20th.. with Jim Anderson in the\nchair. The minutes of the last meeting, dealing\nohl e fly with the 'procurement of Worthington for the\nbar, and the cheap-and-nastiness of some gowns,\nwere quickly dealt with, as was the absence of\ncorrespondence. On the topic of November 5th., the President announced that the Senate had again\ndecreed that any student taken into custody on that\ndav would be hauled before a disciplinary committee\n& either sent down or suspended. Th>v Entertainments\nCommittee therefore proposed to hold, as in previous\nyears,, a hop at Harlington, complete with novelties\nwhich last year included a bonfire and barbecue.\nThe evening's entertainment, including transport\nto and from Harlington, would cost one shilling. There was no vocal opposition, although Mr. Heme\nsought an assurance, promptly given, that the\nInadequacy of the bar would not be repeated. Mr.\nMarshall wanted to know if the proceedings had\nperforce to end at 12 o 'clock, to which Jim Anderson replied that most people have to be back in their digs by that hour, especially the young\nladles. To another question he replied that al though there would be no official rag committee,\nnothing prevented the formation of an ln official one.\nThe Chairman of the Entertainments Committee,\nGeorge Reece, spoke about the Commemoration Ball on October the 26th. He emphasised that the drinks\nwill be at usual pub prices, and that a served\nsupper will be Included.\nJim Anderson thin informed the Union that an\nI.C. Exploration Board had been set up, to encourage\nov s rae as exploration by College expeditions. The\nCollege were giving \u00a35,000, and the Union \u00a31,000.\nThere was no discussion on this.\nQuestion on the progress of the Union elicited\nthe information that the work would be completed\nwithin a year. More rooms In the Beit building were\nto be turned over to the hostel, and it was intended\nthat the Botany and Zoology departments should, even-tu ally, follow suit. The ho j tel would then accomodate\n500 residents.\nThe question of Bookstall prices was yet again\nraised, the!President promising to look into the\nincident cited. The meeting closed at about 1.35,\nwhich was remarkably early. Union meetings are for\nstudents to express their opinions and to ask\nquestions; it is to be hoped that the Union will be\nless subdued in future.\nI.C. EXPLORATION BOARD The Board which was recently set up by the\nRector will consist of:\n1) Professor READ (Chairman)\n2) Professor HEWER\n3) Dr. Gilbert WILSON\n4) Assistant Prof. STEPHENSON\n5) A representative from each of the\nconstituent College Associations.\n6) K. Miller( member of I.C. Council)\n7) J. M. Turner;C&>G Union.\n8) 3.8. Chester; R.3.M. Union.\n9) An R.C.S. Union representative.\nThe finance of the Board was discussed by\nthe Governing Body and the I.C. Council, and both\ndecided to back the venture by grants of \u00a35000\nand \u00a31000 respectively.\nThe Board will meet in the next few weeks\nto discuss plans that any students may place before it. URGENT: will the person who offered to sell an enlarger on\nFresher's day write c/0 Union Rack to Vice President,\nPhoto. Soc.\nAyrton Hall tomorrow\nContinued next column.\nThe answer is difficult. The decree was fair et\n\u2022the time. Its justice should now be tempered with\nmercy - in at ead of which, the Senate House appears\nto have become a mouthpiece of the Metropolitan\nPolice.\n\n"

Samuel Oevone, U. A.. Ph.D., Y.R.S., formerly Professor of Physics at I.C. and\nnew Langworthy Professor of physics in the Victoria\nUniversity of Manchester. After the presentation of\nthe appropriate Scroll by Viscount Falaouth the I.C. Choir e ang, quite nicely, \"Let us now praise famous\nmen\"..Then followed the presentation of Honorary\nFallows. These were Professor emeritus Sir David\nBrunt, Professor Bmeritua Sir Alfred Sgerton, Profiteeritus J. A.S. Rlteon and Professor Baeritus Sir George Thomson - presented by the Staff Orator; and\nMr.H.?<^ron ir., Mr.L.C. Hill, Capt. A.M. Holbein, Sir George Nelson and Ur.f.A '\u00abC.

These gentlemen had! been\nBitting on the front ron of the Arena and they now\ntook their places on the platform.\nthe Choir then Bang \"The Fountain\".words by Christopher Hasr,all, music by Antony Hopkins^ which had\nbeen written especially for the occasion. This piece\nof au sio seemed very fitting, although it could have\nbeen a little more Impressive. The choir's rendering\nof this music was of the standard that we have come\nto expect of them.\nLORD ADRIAN S S PEACH The Special Visitor, Lord Adrian, was introduced by Viscount Falmouth, who gave a brief survey of the two years since the last Commemoration\nDay, making special reference to the expansion\nscheme commenced in1953. Lord Adrian is one of the most eminent of all British scientists today. He is world-famous for\nhis work in technological fields. He spoke of the\nCollege as a late Victorian enterprise, and told\nthose present that Imperialism had changed into\nthe Commonwealth, but that British Technology was\nevident in all comers of the earth -\u2022 a proud monument to the old craftsmanship of our Motherland.\nInventiveness was not taught, it was born, and out\nof this and Craftsmanship had sprung a Technology\nwhich was embodied in the Imperial College. Students, he said, should be trained as leaders of\nthis Technology, and not as single-mended special-is ts Dr. L instead closes Ceremony Lord Adrian, having finished his speech, sat\ndown; and the Rector thanked him for his kindness\nin attending our celebration. Dr. Linstead spoke\nbriefly about the new Honorary Fellows, and then\nto the students who had been presented. He asked\nthem to cast back their minds to the time when they\nwere Freshmen: \"You have changed a great deal!\".\nHe was glad and happy to welcome them too \"The Old\nBoys\" of the College, and he hoped they would carry\non the traditions.\nHaving brought the.ceremony to a close, the\nassembled throng stood for \"The Queen\". The Marehafc rose, and the Recession of the. principal gue s frs followed. Visitors and students alike made their\nway to City and Guilds' College, where, in the\nwords of aR.S. M. Freshman \"A jolly good tea was\nprovided1\" AT THE DORCHESTER CRITICISM OF WEDNESDAY The Commemoration Ball on Wednesday evening\nwas honoured by the presence of the Rector and hi a wife. Unfortunately, the high price and the midweek date seemed to have kept away many other of\nour prominent members, who would otherwise have at-tended. More fortunately,perhaps, those who went\nfound that the thick carpets, the gilt and cut glass\nof the Dorchester made even the most impecunious\nof us feel at ease with our bankers.\nAttempt to steal College Flag> Bill Sav ill's Orchestra was very good, and\nhis piper had the most unlikely people doing eight-some reels to their obvious enjoyment. The College\nFlag had been hung behind the high table, in spite\nof an earlier and unsuccessful attempt to purloin\nit on the way to the Dorchester. The meal proved to\nbe- very pleasant, and \"Le Vacherln aux Praises\", on\nsampling, was none other than Strawberry Flan and\nIce Cream. The wines and service, naturally enough,\nwere a credit to the Dorchester. When dancing finally ceased at 2.30, the \"Evening\" was continued by\nvarious groups at London Airport, the Hostel, and\nfinally in the Pubs of Covent Garden.\nTo the Entertainments Chairman and Secretary\nmust go a vote of thanks for a good Ball.

We included the remark \"when the\nAmerican Servicemen were in Britain.\" which was a misrepresentation of the Rector's remark about\n\"what the Americans call the bumper-baby crops of\nthe\" war years.\"\nThe Freshmen enjoyed a paradox i al situation\nat the beginning of this session.

BOXING Boxing to moat people at I.C. is a barbarous, bloody and\nbrutal sport. This is simply not true. To begin vita, a boxer\nmust bo very fit, and training is rigorous. I.C. has a training session three times a week, w hio his as follows.\nO3s2 j min. rounds skipping; to strengthen leg and shoulder\nt siu soles and to develop lightness of foot and breath control.\n2) 20 nd n. of exo er c is es j for stomach, leg and arm muscles.\n3) 74- min. shadow boxing (speed)\n4.) 7i min. light bag punching (speed & timing)\n5 5 H min. heavy bag punching (arm mu soles)6) Short sparing with 16 oz. gloves.\n7) Skipping and road vr ark( for limbering down)\n8) Actual Ringwork. 8 oz. gloves and gum-shield worn.

One may only suppose that its misguided\nauthor was temp arar i ly lodged in some modern Utopia.\nHe proposes that the Ball be held in some such\npla oe as the Kensington Town Hall, implying that the\nstandard would not suffer. Really J. V.B., one might as\nwell say that 'Felix' should be printed on toilet paper.\nIt wu ld indeed be cheaper and contain the basic essentials\nbut with due respect to the above mentioned Hall, would it be really suitable? Even at the time of writing was not\nJ. V.B. himself dubious about this question? If not, then\nwhy should he raise the over-familiar or y for sub sid is ation, as an alternative method of \"liquidating\" the Ball as we\nknow it?\nHere may I quote 'Viewpoint' j \"How many of us oar, really afford this extravagance?\"\nI was pleased to learn that J. V.B. regards the\nBall as an extravagance. It is a view I think we all share,\nbut few would agree to the Union paying for jn extravagance\nat the expense of some more mundane and useful service,\nsuch as the maintenance of our Sports Ground. For that is\nwhat sub sid is ation would mean since the resources of the\nUnion are not limitless.\nMay I further suggest that, if such folly was\nblessed by Council, it would benefit only a small minority\nof Union members. To be factual let us say that the\nmaximum number to be accomodate d would be a thousand. Off\nhand I know of no suitable place for even this number.\nAllow a meagre 3\u00b00 for Staff, old students, eto. We are\nleft with 350 double tickets - 350 students sub sidi sed at\na luxury by a total of some 2500. Is this satisfactory?\nIn conclusion, may I heartily endorse J. V.B.' s opinion that all students should attend at least one\nCommemoration Ball but please, a real Ball not an abortion\nof' one.\nTours sincerely,\nS.d. Reeoe.\nChairman\nI.C. Union Entertainments Committee.\nWe thank Mr. Leaver for his letter explaining\nthe U.L. U. cards but we do think that U.L.
