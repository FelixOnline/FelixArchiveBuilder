The main theme is \"con-temporary American cinema\"\nwith emphasis on experimental,\ndocumentary and unseen films. There wil j also be screening of\nnew student films and European\ncinema. Some social events will be put on by the Independent\nFilm Distributors Association during the ten days of the\nFestival. The main aim of the Festival is to stimulate a warnes s and discussion about the potent i al of films. The directors and\nlecturers at the Festival will form a considerable focal point\nfor argument and exchange of\nideas.\nIn order to be able to take\npart in this event you must be a member of the Film Society and\nalso hold a Members Pass for\nthe Festival.

Ov p325 students have paid into the fund; which is a50% better achievement than ever before.\nThe rent strike is a protest\non four main issues:1. Hall fees have been increased twice in mid session: from\n\u00a398-50 to \u00a3111-25 in the second\nterm and to \u00a3116-25 in the third\nterm making hall fees the highest in the country.\n2. There is a rent freeze on\nself catering ac como dati on therefore the University cannot\nincrease rents on th^se.\n3. The University increased\nstudent House rents, admitting\nthis was to recover loses made\nduring the period of the rent\nfreeze. The Union claim this is illegal as it is against\na. the one year contract by\nthe Union and the University.\nb. the provisions of the rent '\n. act.4. While return to original level\nof rents is demanded now the\nUnion recognise that the only\nlong term solution is an increase in the grant to cover rising ac como dati on costs. The University has in fact\ngiven way on point three admitting they were legally in the\nwrong and thanking the Union for pointing this out. Student\nHouse rents are now back to\nsummer 1974 levels and the\nPresident of the Union, Francis Hayden hopes hall fees will soon follow. He said \"Students\nare being hit by inflation, but\nStudents are paying for both;\nthis just is not equitable.\"\nUGM Report\n\"THE BEST Union meeting we've had this year\" commented\nthe Hon Sec after this U GM. The usual business was dealt with fairly speedily, thus paving\nthe way for discussion on the five motions on the agenda.\nThe first motion, on grants and educational cut-backs was overwhelmingly voted through\nafter some debate. The main\npoints contained in this motion\nbeing, firstly, that FE colleges were worst hit by the cut-backs\nand secondly that education is a right . The second motion proposed by Paul Watkins, (the\nexternal\nExternal Affairs Officer) which was on the EEC was fiercely\ndebated with Mr Gerrard speaking against the motion. The essential point was that students should vote NO in the coming referendum. Mr Steve Brady\nspoke for the motion interpreting it as part of the NF's policy.\nAfter as peach against by Mar g Attenborough and a summing.up\nby the proposer the motion was defeated by 53 votes to 36.\nIn his speech for the motion\non Education policy the Pre* sident said \"we should not just\nthink economist ic ally. The Union should also pursue a long\nterm policy on education...\nthere should be adequate financing of education that will be\nadequate\nbeneficial especially in adult\neducation\" .There being no\nspeech against the motion was carried. Mr Brady challenged the\nquorum. The challenge was upheld by the chairman, the Deputy President.\nA meeting of the External\nAffairs Committee then moved\ninto session. At this point the\nDP,R on Kill, who was in the\nchair categorically stated that\nthe meeting would \"remain\nquo rate as long as the ICU\nexecutive and Mr Watkins are\nstill here\".\nThe President spoke for the\nmotion on South Africa which\ncalled for release of political prisoners in South Africa and\nan ending of the illegal occupation of Namibia (Rho\nation of Namibia by South A fri can police. In a very strong\nspeech for the motion the Pre sident said \"If the government\nI elect pursues policies which\nagree with illegal occupation of\nNamibia (Rhodesia), apartheid\nin South Africa and illegal declaration of independence as in\nZimbabwe then that government\nis not representative of my\nviews\" . On the question liberation movements he said\n\"/ do not support any and sundry liberation movements ...\nwhat is more important is demo-c racy, progress and involvement\nof people in the government of\nthemselves - this is not going\non in South Africa or Namibia\" .\nMr Brady speaking against said\n\"If I were a black in South\nAfrica I would rather be ruled by\na white .. when colonia sed countries are given independence they usually end up as\ndictatorships\". Two amendments were made to the motion\nbefore it was passed by a large\nmajority.\nThe second of Mr Watkin's motions and the last on the\nsheet was on the Government's economic policy and after a speech against by Mr Pete\nTeague and a lengthy debate\nwas passed by 19 votes to 17 .\nThe meeting closed at\napproximately 2.30pm. SLICE\nSave\nLighting and\nImperial\nCollege\nEnergy\nHelp to SLICE costs by using energy\nwisely in the College .In 1975 energy\ncosts, mainly for heating and electricity,\nare estimated to increase by about 50%\nover last year. With no increase in the\nGovernment grant to the College, this\nmeans that YOU wilt have to make do with less - facilities\neg. laboratory materials, lecture notes, UNION grant, in\norder to pay the increased energy bills.\nYou can help by:\n\u2022Closing all external doors and windows\n\u2022Switching off all unnecessary lights\n\u2022Using minimum hot water\n\u2022Thinking twice before switching on power consuming equipment - even if you are doing a routine experiment.\n\u2022Remembering to switch off as soon as you have\nfinished.\nIn these ways you can help to SLICE the bills and help\nyourself at the same time .\nAny suggestions for SLICING energy costs should be\nsent to\nSLICE c/o Dept .of Electrical Engineering .\n\n"

And it would come\nas even less of a surprise were it to be\nannounced that our president would be\nstanding for UL U president, a post\nwhich the Broad Left shackled onto last\nyear with John Carr, Trevor's now -close associate. Having followed Trevor's \"rise to\npower\" from its infancy when we were\ntogether as first-year chemists, it has\nbeen easy to predict his next move after\nICU president. It is hoped, however, that\nthe time spent on his extensive activities in ULU in no way contributed to the\ncall for the third sabbatical to be shifted\nto the union central administration because of the overload of IC union work .\nIf this is not so, let me retract the idea;\nif it is correct, however, may I be the\nfirst to express my disgust.\nIn the event that Trevor does become\nUL U president, I sincerely hope that he\ndoes not forget the \u00a31 wager that we\nstruck sometime last September .\n*\nRegarding the letter from Dru Brown,\nthe Guiidsheet Editor, may I say, Dr u, that your nai vit y astounds me. I am most\nenvious that you are capable of operating\nevery piece of equipment in the production\nof Guiidsheet. You must forgive me for\nnot having the time to serve a five-year\napprenticeship before operating the offset\nii tho machine . I am perfectly capable of\noperating the \u00a32,000's worth of var it y per, but you must forgive me further for\nnot attempting to operate it when it had\nmechanical faults (the mechanic had to\ncall twice that particular week ).\n*\nStrange that it should be Sennet\naccusing the FELIX Board of making a statement without foundation (Letters,\npage 9). Thirteen papers represented out\nof a total of fifty or so does not negate\nthe fact that the opinion of the meeting\nwas practically unanimous. Several\npapers could not make the meeting, but\nover the phone they concurred with the\nmeeting's opinion. Also, it is quite clear\nnational newspapers are widely read in\nfamilies, hotels, clubs etc and so they\ncan claim an easy average of25 readers\no er copy. But can Sennet?\nImperial College Union,\n27th January, 1975.\nSir,\nI must thank Steve Brady\nfor attempting to begin a debate\nat the National Front in the last\nedition of FELIX. It is about\ntime that page 2 was occupied\nby something rather more serious\nand worthwhile than the\npettiness which has characterised it this term (Hear, hear! \u2014\nEd.).\nHowever, I take issue with\nvirtually every point that he raised. Space does not permit an\nanswer to all of them, but I will take up the major pieces of\nnonsense.\nTo suggest that I know\nnothing of the National Front's policies is quite incorrect, I have taken, a very strong\ninterest in British fascism for\nsome time; my interest was further stimulated by two\nincidents. About eighteen months\nago, it became known to me that\nI was a National Front 'target'\nin Manchester. This news was confirmed when an attempt was made by some thugs claiming to\nbe associated with the NF, to\n'get me', i.e. beat the hell out\nof me. Fortunately, I escaped\nand the NF has disappeared\nfrom that city since.\nYour comparison of the NF with 'nationalist movements' of\nAfrica is quite spurious. All the movements which could\npossibly fall under that heading\nwere fighting against domination\nfrom abroad. They were battling\ncolonialism, and were pitted\nagainst an enemy which was far more powerful than they in material terms, since it totally\ncontrolled the colonial economy.\nThey fought an enemy which had\nimposed its will by force of\narms for centuries. Who is the\nNF fighting? A handful of bus-r lifts conductors, road-sweepers,\nhousewives, unemployed youths,\nshopkeepers and students. Can this handful be compared to the\ncolonial armies deployed against\nthe passive resistance of Gandhi or the constitutional\nprotest of Nyerere in Tanganyika? Today a number of liberation\nmovements fight in Africa. I do\nnot support all, or even many of\nthem, as Steve Brady implied.\nI support those who have fought\nfor genuinely progressive\npolicies, who will work for\npeace and freedom for their\npeople. I can name specifically, the two Portuguese movements\nPAIGC in Guine, and F RE LIMO in Mozambique. I reject those\nmovements which seek to impose\nany kink of domination over their\npeople, for example, the\nassociates of Idi Amin. With respect to the NF's attitude towards i Jews, I would\npoint out that most of the NF's present leaders, including\nTy nd all and Webster were\nassociated with Colin Jordon\nfor many years, and echoed the\nvile anti-Jewish filth which he\nspewed forth. Example: 'The\nJew is a poisonous maggot\nfeeding on a body in an advanced\nstate of decay' - John Ty nd all, founder and Director of the NF. My comments on the use of the Race Relations Act are not\noriginal. This Union has itself\npledged support for any 'peaceful\naction' against racism. I interpret the use of the Act, introduced to protect all parts\nof the population from un necessary and racist victim-is ation and insult, as peaceful\naction. If the NF is not getting\nat people just because of their\ncolour, then no problems should\narise.\nI certainly do not prevent\nthe NF from putting out bump h. However, Mr.Brady will know it\nis a disciplinary offence to put\nup any stickers on walls in FELIX \u00a9\nMichael J. L.

Please desist, Mr.Brady, or the\nExecutive( multi-racial as it is) will have to consider what\naction can be taken to combat\nthis. By the way, I assume\nMr.Brady objects to my being\nelected, democratically (like\nLord Pitt) to 'a position of\npower'. If so, will he (dem-ocr a tic ally) challenge the right\nof the IC electorate, and tell\nthe 900 students who voted for\nme last year that they had no\nright to do so because I am not\nwhite?\nYours (in black & white),\nTrevor Phillips. P.S. It is instructive to note\nthat the NF's arguments about\nimmigrants (depriving the\n' British of jobs, houses, etc), have been used against the\nIrish for centuries. Will you go\nhome, Mr.Brady ?\nImperial College\n22nd January 1975\nSir,\nAs Is at in my local last\nnight drinking my \"OLD BOG\"\nXXX SPECIAL, it suddenly\noccured to me that there must\nbe many other students at IC who share my taste for all wonderful beers that England' s green and pleasant land has to\noffer us all. With this in mind I should like to use your organ\n(i) to appeal for support in\nforming a REAL ALE SOCIETY\nin the College. Our objectives\nmight be\n-to go boozing both near and\nfar, Youngs, Marstons, Samuel\nSmiths, Shepherd Neame etc are\navailable within spitting\ndistance of IC and perhaps\nAdnams, Boddingtons, Hartleys\netc would come within easy\nreach, given a little\norganization.

The reason why\nthis album is so bitterly disappointing is\nnpt due to the fact that an orchestra was\nuse a( no, that idea still remains a very\ngood one), but more because the orchestration is too weak-kneed at the crucial\nRECORDS Jack Llewellyn points of this now-legendary piece of\nmusic. The crispness and lang oro us resonance of Mike Oldfield* s original is\nlost to insipid strings, brazen brass, over r elegant woodwind and an enthusiastic\nbass drum.\nThe first major climax in the work\n(early on side one) is pretty em baras sing. The balance of the melodic lines so-easily\nattained in an electronic recording studio\nis nowhere to be seen as the bass drum\nthrashes around knocking all the other\nparts to oblivion. There is no sharp contrast of orchestration to hold together the end of side one\nlike the original does with the grand piano,\nmandolin, glockenspiel etc; there is just\nwhat appears to be the same motif repeated again and again - thus defining an\nall time low in monotony.\nAll this record achieves is to make one\nmore appreciative of the original 'Bells'.\nTHE BLACK HOLE OF RCS RCS' s answer to\nGuilds' W.H.O.. the dreaded\n'Black Hole' struck on Friday\nafternoon. Six pretty red and white shields prepared for the\nCity and Guilds Dinner and\nDance disappeared from the\nJ CR.

His reply\nplumbed the depths of banality:\n\"We never thought of that\" .\nBy that time however, these\nwere no questions left. But to\nhis credit, on hearing that the\nparty we had been promised had\nbeen cancelled, Bamber did suggest a beer kitty for us. The\nnasty producer refused.\nWe tried hard to smile but\nsucceeded only in snarling . So\nwe zonked the studio with a Hey Vivol with 'Mike' held aloft,\nadjourned to the bar and eventually returned to London .\nCROSSCOUNTRY Wednesday the 29th January\nwas, for hose that had for-gotten, wet. Indeed the fixture\nagains Royal Vets and LSE( again...) could be aptly entitled \" A pre s Parliament Hill le deluge\".

Dave Payne\nalso demonstrated an amusing rolling down hill start,\nto the chagrin of the Cortina\ndriver behind us (sorry\nmiss us!). Although previous\nvisitors to Newlands had\nbeen asserting that it was\n\" just round the next bend\" for some time, it wasn't till\nwe came across track suited individuals and the youths\nrace, that this optimism was\njustified. From what we could gather from the results, we were\nperhaps the only college\nteams competing and good\nperformances all round helped\nthe first team to 20th place\nout of a field of37. Due to\nin effie nt organization the\nposition of the second team\nremains indeterminate but\nabout 30th.

    "content": "6 FELIX on Jacqui Gerrard\nAndy Watson The Hon. Sec. is a pleasant sort of person, with an air of conf ice n ce and competence. She sat with a polite smile on\nher face while I bumbled around getting\ncoffee from the refectory counter, slopping\nit in the saucers, dropping cigarette ash\nin it, and forgetting spoons. She even\nlaughed when part way through the interview I discovered I hadn't turned on the\ntape recorder.\n'I'm a very ordered person', she told me,\n'Not tidy perhaps but methodical'. Admirable\nqualities in a secretary.\nWe talked about her job. The position which Jacqui holds entails a great deal of day-to-day running of Union a ff iar s \u2014\norganisation of office paper work; taking\nthe minutes at council, executive and other\nmeetings; posting nomination papers and\ngeneral running of election s.'I'm quite fully occupied just keeping\nthings ticking over, and in addition I feel\nI ought to do something more positive,\ncompiling a document detailing council\ndecisions since 1962, for instance, which\nhas meant that the obsolete policies can\nbe revised'.\nWhat, I wondered, was a nice girl like her doing at a college like this? A youthful\nlove for science seems to have had something to do with it. At school she had\nsacr if i oed every Saturday morning for two\nyears for the privilege of taking 0 level physics. She came to IC because it was\none of the few colleges in the country\nwhere she could study pure mathematics,\n'Fool as 1 was, 1 thought I'd enjoyed\nit'. She has since seen the error of her\nways and intends to steer herself in a more practical direction.\nBoth Jacqui' s career in student politics and her marriage to Bill Gerrard, came\nabout as a result of her first RCS union\nmeeting.\n'He was just retiring as president of\nRCSU. I met him there, and things sort of\nprogressed from that point, as it were'.\n(Obviously, there are un looked for ad vantages in being a 'somebody' in the\nCC U's!). Jacqui spends most of her spare time\nwith friends from the college.\n'In general I'm not a disco/concert\ngoer, 'nor have I a minority interest, like\nfolk or jazz. My social activity is chatting\nto people, going to parties and that sort of\nthing. There's plenty of social life in the\ncollege but most it*iU*ts don't use it.\nThey prefer, like me, to do other things,\nor they live too far out, or they're too busy\nworking'. Especially that they are too\nbusy working. At another point she ex pressed the opinion that a random sampling\nof the men at IC would show that all that\nmost of them want to do is sit and study.\nShe is aware too, that the majority of students are not interested in the running\nof the Union. As we were leaving she showed me the notice board where she had\npinned nomination papers for several posts\nincluding the delegates to the forthcoming\nNational Conference. Sure enough, not one\nname was on any of the papers.\nTOUCHSTONE MARRIAGE' Speaker: Dr. Wendy Green gross FOR AN institution which has come under heavy fire from\nextremists recently, marriage still appears to be as perky, fashionable and, in some form or other, necessary as it ever has been.\nLast weekend's Touchstone discussion clearly came to that general conclusion and it was further felt that in order for society to\nsurvive in any recognisable\nform, then the one-to-one\nmarriage partnership will be of\nprimary importance.\nThe speaker was leading\ngynaecologist and radio broad-caster Dr.Wendy Greengross,\nwho introduced the subject with\na brief introduced\na brief survey of the historical\nmotivations associated with\nmarriage. She continued by\nsharply contrasting these with\npresent-day motivations whilst deftly explaining the relations hip between social attitudes\nand the historical environment,\nwhich was responsible for such\na contrast. There once was a day when\nthe family was the social unit.\nThe father was the provider who\nfinanced the home and the\nchildren's education, who was\nthe head of the family, took all the major decisions and wielded\nabsolute authority. The mother\ncooked, sewed, brought the children up and was an internal\npart of the household. Marriage\nwas a socio-economic necessity\nand few could really manage\nwithout it .Sex was enjoyed by\nmen, suffered by women and\nthat was the end of it. Today, however, with the ad vent ot suffrage, social security, contraception, state edu-cation, the emancipated woman,\nconvenience foods and labour\nsaving household gadgets the\ndeployment of a family's resp on sibi li ties is no longer clear\ncut and the father's authority as the sole provider has been\nseriously eroded.\nAs a result the economic\naspect of marriage has been\ndiminished and this is believed\nto be an important factor when\nconsidering why a couple will prefer to get a divorce rather\nthan fight to save the marriage.\nThe divorce rate is quite\nstartling t there are about\n425,000 marriages per year. Out\nof these, 111,000 end in divorce\nso the actual divorce rate is about one in four.\nThis, in Dr. Greengross's opinion, has led to the unfortunate attitude that the institution of marriage is being under-valued: some people would prefer divorce rather than work for\nthe marriage.\nThroughout the discuss sion weekend various points were\nmade which demand mention:\nPositive education for marriage\nwould probably prove to be\nfruitless - elimination of identifiable prejudices would be pre-fer able. Marriage is putting up\nMETAMORPHOSIS\nSo Sonia The bang of Drums\nLate of the The crash of\nCPE or B( ML), Tyndalls\nYou are now to be An NF parade\nFound 1 s a far cry from\nAmongst the maul ers The furtive\nAnd hit-men of the Placing\nNational Front.

Infatuation is the assertion of an ideal image on\nsomeone. Love is more easily recognised than defined but\nessentially love in marriage is\na kind of initial passion which mellows into a tasting friends hip. Alternative forms of marriage\nwere briefly discussed including\nhomosexual group and communal\nrelationships. Dr Greengross\nwas clear in her opinion when\nshe said that one in every four\npeople is doomed to be a divorce casualty; so she is all for\nopening up new options for prospective candidates for the\nmarriage stakes. The last word on marriage\nwas \"You've got to work hard\nat it!\".\n\n"

    "content": "mix PRE C3 P3CI The White Paper on Public Expenditure\npublished last week brings one piece of\ngood news for students. It is possible\nthat there will be some money allocated to\nbuild student residences. This is a first\npriority for city-centre institut ien s such\nas IC, now suffering a decline in both\napplications and actual numbers, mainly\nbecause of the ever-increasing shortage of accommodation.\nIt comes at an opportune time for us, in\nparticular. I have just completed a memorandum on the development of the College for the years 1977-82. This is the\nUnion's contribution to the discussions which take place before the College presents its\" five year plan\" to the University Grants Committee from whom we receive our major financial support on a five-yearly (quin que n ni al basis). The White Paper comes at the right moment because I have J a belled our first priority to\nbe provision of more student ac com moda tion, (see below)\nHowever, it is not enough to think\nthat a few words in a White Paper,\nhinting at a promise for three or four\nwears hence is enough. Pressure must\nbe sustained from now on wards to\nmake sure that that promise is kept.\nThe White Paper gives hope for little\nelse but more cuts in education spend-ing, in line with the present policy.\nThis policy is itself derived from Margaret\nThatcher's infamous White Paper of 1973,\nlaughingly entitled \" Education: A Framework for Expansion\". Since the public ation of that document, the Education\nsector has steadily shrunk. Now, with Reg Prentice carrying on the good work (is he\na future Tory leader?), there seems little\nhope of reversing the trend, except by\nhard campaigns -This is yet another reason for actively supporting the Grants/Cuts\nCampaign mounted this term; the\nfuture rests on success now.\nA number of issues were raised in our\nmemorandum on the quin que n niu m.I have\nalready mentioned the provision of new\naccommodation - the project which is specifically singled out is completion of\nL instead Hall. Other points:\n* No change is forecast for the Union's structure. We will inevitably\nexpand our complement of full-time officers and staff.\n\" Little change in the role of CCU'S.* Redecoration of the Union building\n* Expansion of the Bookshop to\nprovide a mere varied range of goods.\nWe have proposed improvements in Medi cal and Welfare Services, in particular\na new clinic to deal with family planning,\nbirth control and social diseases. Sports,\nwe have said should be an integral part of\nCollege Life and urged construction of\nnew indoor facilities in South Kinsington,\nas well as improved transport to Harlin g Trevor Phillips ton. In a section on academic developments we call for improved teaching, and\na better system of Vacation Training.\nThe need for greater insight into in d rust rial practice is stressed. We support the\nexpansion of Associated Studies, particularly languages.\nIt remains to be seen how much of\nthat little lot can be achieved; 1 am\nconfident that these are all developments for which powerful arguments\ncan be made. We need a more attractive College or we will have an IC\nwithout students.\nOne section of the memorandum dealt\nwith is Women in IC.I cannot see a great\ninflux of women into the College in the\nnext seven years. However, I am confident\nthat the women here will begin to make a more vital and corporate contribution to\nlife in College. It is to be hoped that the\nembryo group, Women in Science, which apparently had a very successful first\nmeeting last week, will begin to draw\nmore women into considering in a serious\nway, their professions. It deserves the\nsupport of any woman with two brain cells to rub together, and it will receive the\nsupport of the Union, I hope.\nf there is to be an end to d is in cent ves and discouragement to women\nn vol ved in science and engineering,\nhe impetus must come from within the\ninstitutions. Imperial College is as\ngood a place to start as any.\nGRANTS/ CUTS\nThe cutbacks now taking place within the education\nsystem are best illustrated by the numerous closed owns of Colleges of Education, ail over the country. It is the\navowed intention of the DES to cut the number of teacher\ntraining places by half - on the pretext of a falling birth-rate. The proposed Furzedown - Phillips Fawcett merger,\nthe total number of students is over 1000. After the merger\nthere will only be 600 students. This is the meaning of\neducation cats - and at a time when the schools are short\nof teachers, and classes of 40 are the norm.\nThe DES is trying to close down Al nw ich College in Northumberland - in the face of opposition from the stud-ents, staff and the townspeople, for whom the College is a mainstay of the local economy. Al nw ich is the only\nCollege for miles around, and unique in a number of respects. It does not make sense to close it down.\nBut the overriding priority of Prentice and his minions\nis to cut costs now at any expense to the future of e duc ation.\nFIGHT THE\nCUTS\nThe claim that NUS has submitted for the Main Rate of\nGrant is \u00a3845. A40% rise may sound like a lot. but remember that the grant is losing its value at a rate of \u00a37.90 per\nmonth. Previous grants have been set so as to be adequate\nin the first month of the academic year. The NUS claim is calculated to be more than adequate in the first term, adequate in the second, and lagging behind only in the third\nterm, when it would be compensated for by the (theoretical)\nfirst - term surplus.\nThis seems to be a more sensible way of dealing with\ninflation. THE GRANT MUST LAST FOR30 WEEKS NOT JUST10. A DECENT\nGRANT FOR\nALL\nSTUDENTS\n\n"

At the same time, a copy of this\nletter was sent to John Mortimer, the R SMU President .\nThe following Monday, 3rd February, the City and Guilds Union received two letters that\ncontradicted each other. It\nwas decided that one of the\nletters was a fake and after\nsome scrutiny, it was agreed\nwhich one of the two it was. The fake letter contained a telephone number and a name,\nAndy Beck, whom C& GU were\nto contact in order to sell the\nmascot.\nAndy Beck was contacted\nat the given phone number and\na meeting was arranged to be\nheld at 4 . 0 0 p.m. on Wednesday\n5th February, to exchange\nDavey for the agreed sum. However, on Wednesday\nmorning, C& GU made a wooden\nreplica which looked just like the real thing and filled it with\nwet sand.\nThe said meeting took\nplace at the agreed time and\nthe replica was exchanged for\n\u00a350. It has since come to\nlight that this person, Andy\nBeck, was in fact acting on\ninstructions from R SMU( as\nC& GU had suspected), although\nhe is not a member of RS M. It would thus appear that\nR SMU now have a \"Wooden\nDavey\" and they are \u00a350 the\npoorer for it, whereas C& GU still have the original Davey. When The Two Ends Of The POLITICAL SPECTRUM Meet\nYESTERDAY THERE was a confrontation between the National Front and all the left of centre political groups a tIC. This followed an attempt by the NF to book a room under the auspices of the Young Socialist Student Society for 1 p.m. yesterday.\nHowever the booking was revoked and an open meet i ng of the\nexternal affairs committee was called in its stead. However the\nNational Front ( NF) did not agree that their meeting had been cancelled.\nSo 12.30pm saw a large gathering in the front entrance to\nMech. Eng. waiting for dev elopements. The NF and Soci a lists were both there distributing\nopposing literature. Also present were the college author it ies, and the police who were\n\"observing a NF march from the\nV&A\" When Stoic filmed the scene\nthe socialists burst into a chant\nof \"National Front - Nazi\nFront\". Also \"what are you going to do with the blacks?\" To which NF replied \"kick them\nout.\" The NF placards (small\npieces of cardboard box) read:\n\"Don't be bullied by communist thugs\", \"National Front\nputs Britain First\", \"Stand Up\nfor Democracy\", \"Stand Up for\nFree Speech.\"\nICU President, Trevor Phil lips then asked that the assembly move into Room 342 to begin the meeting on how to oppose fascism , called by IC external affairs committee.\nThe open meeting was then\nheld, no-one being denied entry.\n\n"

ICWA\nJUL IA DUNNING\nI FEEL I SHOULD draw the attention all ICWA members to a new movement developing within the Association. For the sixty odd years of it's existence, ICWA has for the most part been a non-political social body.\nIt may be argued that this is\nhow it should stay for the next\nsixty years but the basis of life\nis change .So therefore should\nICWA change.\nOn Wednesday, January 29th a meeting was held in the ICWA\nlounge. It's object - to discuss the feasibility and possible support of a Women in Science\ngroup within I.C. About thirty\nwomen came and there ensued\nwhat I feel was not only a worth\nwhile exchange of ideas, but\nwhat was for me quite an en lightening experience.\nAs President of the Association, and also a3rd year\nstudent with finals looming\ncloser every day, I have very\nlittle spare time. The suggestion of bringing ICWA more\ndirectly into investigating problems both academic and social of the students in the college\nhas been put to me on a number of occasions. My reply has\nalways been that I have neither\nthe time,nor, I had assumed, the\nsupport for such activities. I still do not have a great\ndeal of spare time but the support is undoubtedly there.\nThe idea of setting up the\ngroup was suggested by Karen\nGadd, a second year student in\nMechanical Engineering. I agreed to give my support to the\narranging of the meeting and\nalso to introduce it.\nWhat ensued was a general\ndiscussion of the ideas Karen\nhad for the group and other\nideas were soon forthcoming\nfrom the floor. At the end of the\nmeeting a number of suggestions had been put forward.\nSome of these briefly were:-1. To set up a Women in\nScience group within and\nfinanced by ICWA, but even\nso as a relatively separate\ngroup .\n2. That the purpose of such a group should encompass\nacademic and social problems of all students, but\nparticularly of the women at\nI.C.; also that it should investigate means of encouraging in the schools and in\ngeneral outside of college\ninto science careers.\n3. A survey should be made of\nall the departments in I.C. by a student body, such as\nWomen in Science, with the\nview to producing a document on the social and\nacademic facilities of each\ndepartment, particularly\ngiving it's views on women\nstudents. This document\nshould then be presented at\nthe annual meeting of careers masters in I.C. during\nthe Easter vacation (this is\narranged by the Admissions\nPolicy people). A/ so, the\npossibility could then b rise of printing this document in\nthe college prospectus.\nIt was also decided that for\nthe time being the group should\nmeet every Wednesday lunchtime in the ICWA lounge and\ninvite along a series of guest\nspeakers. With this in mind, I am calling a General Meeting\non Wednesday, the 12th of\nFebruary at 12.30p.m. in the\nICWA lounge.\nPlease come along, as together with the meeting of the\nWomen in Science group, I feel\na number of items should be\ndiscussed by a well represented number of lew arians with a wide spectrum of views. The\nmeeting will include a talk by\nme on the forthcoming ICWA\nelections and also on possible\nfuture changes in the constitution of ICWA.\nlong pauses.
