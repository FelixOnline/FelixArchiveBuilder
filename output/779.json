    "content": "Upfeeat\nTV & RADIO\nGUIDE\nRADIO \u2022 I doubt if I can stand much more\nof those inane Capital DJs telling me\nthat they've turned 'the power up'\nsince their format changed last week.\nLBC have also changed their\nprogramming in the last month to\ninclude less talk and more music. My spies tell me that this may have\nsomething to do with a new advertising war between the two\nLondon-based independent radio\nstations. LBC have brought in such\nnames as Michael Aspel and Henry\nKelly to do weekend shows and have\nmoved Steve Allen from his popular\nWeekend Night Extra to an earlier'\ntime of 7-9pm Fridays, Saturdays and\nSundays to host The Night is Young.\nPersonally, I find LBC' s new\narrangement a bit of a disappointment. The late night\nprogrammes lack any sort of depth\nafter the demise of Night Extra\nmaking way for more tedious phone-ins. The only advantage is that I now\nfind it a lot easier to get to sleep at\nnights.\nThe BBC radio stations always have\na few programmes worth listening to.\nOn Saturday John Peel talks to his\nproducer John Walters about his\nlistening life (Radio One, 2pm) in\nPeeling Back the Years. This week\nis the third of a series concentrating\non the pre-punk years. Where have\nspecial consumer report on ' You Together with Your House and\nPossessions and other Things as\nWell'.' \u2022 World Cup Cricket Special starts\nnext Monday on Radio Three\n(5.00pm on 1215kHz only). The first\nmatch is England v Pakistan with live\ncommentary from Rawalpindi. I wonder if they'll be eating cakes from\nMrs Brown, Sheffield, in Pakistan as\nwell?\n\u2022 Radio Three repeats its look at\nEinstein's most radical predictions\nabout the existence of gravity waves\nin One Billionth of an Atom\n(Monday, 9.15pm). This programme\nmay be slightly elementary for the\nphysicists amongst you but most will\nbe able to sym pathis e with Professors\nRon Drever, James Hough and\nBernard Schutz in their attempts to\nmeasure the distance of one billionth\nof an atom.\n\u2022Imperial College Radio can be very\ngood or very bad depending on who's broadcasting. There are a few regular\nshows but most tend to be very\n'spontaneous'. Another City\n(Wednesday, 11pm) appeals to the\nCollege hippy element and Nigel on\nthe Wireless (Tuesday, 9pm) to the\nsloppy ones. These are both seasoned\nshows so they'll be no crashing the\nIRN news.\nTELEVISION \u2022 Living in hall, you will probably\nfind, is incredibly frustrating if you\nwant to watch a particular\nprogramme. Invariably the majority\nwill want to watch the other side.\nSaturday morning is the best time to\nmono polis e the TV set while the rest\nare nursing hangovers or catching up\non their sleep quota. The trouble is\nthat most programmes aren't worth\nwatching at that time of day. Except\nfor the wonderful Dancin' Days\n(Channel Four, 11.30pm), that is.\nall the punks gone? These\nprogrammes are always spontaneous\nand Peely obviously enjoys talking to\nJohn Walters so it's always fun.\n\u2022 Also on Saturday, Radio Four\nbroadcasts Radio Active: its highly\nsuccessful radio parody (12.25pm). This week the radio station carries a Probably one of the worst soaps I have every watched but compulsive\nwatching due to the bad dubbing\u2014it\nwas made in Brazil\u2014and bad acting.\nThe pace is incredibly slow but it's a scream!\n\u2022 \"Football's a funny old game\" and\nother such gems from the mouth of\nJimmy Greaves, ex-football and ex-alcoholic, can be heard when he\npartners Ian St John on Saturday for\nSaint & Greavsie (ITV, 1.05pm). It's mostly football talk but it's worth\nwatching just for Greavsie's one\nliners!\n\u2022 Saturday evening contains the\ndilemma of whether to ogg le at Jerry\nDowijtown\nMUSIC\nHall on the Dame Edna Experience\n(ITV, 10.30pm), watch vintage\nMonty Python (BBC, 10.45pm), or\nSt Elsewhere (Channel Four,10.00 pm) followed by Saturday\nAlmost Live (Channel Four,11.00 pm). Sunday's highlight is a brand new\nClive James on Television (ITV,\n9pm) and is probably the only thing\nworth watching that day, apart from\nEastenders (BBC1, 2pm) and the\nPeter Seller's film Battle of the Sexes\n(BBC1, 3pm). \u2022 World Cup Cricket (BBC1,\n12.05pm) on Monday takes over from\nthe live Radio 3 coverage and shows\nthe closing stages of Pakistan v England. Later on that evening there's a new sere is of Brush Strokes\n(BBC1, 8pm) whose best feature is\nthe Dexy's Midnight Runners intro\nmusic. Also Doctor Who (BBC1,\n7.35pm) with that hideous Bonnie\nLangford and another chance to see\nthe Cricket at 6.35pm( BBC2).\n\u2022 Other pg or am mes not to miss\ninclude the latest in Eastenders\n(Tuesday, Thursday, 7.30pm BBC1)\nAmerican Football (Channel Four,\nTuesday, 10pm), and the new series\nof Alas Smith and Jones (BBC2,\nThursday, 9pm). HIGHLIGHT OF THE WEEK. \u2022Elton John in Australia\n(1.00am \u20142.00am Monday morning,\nNight Network ITV). Elton plays the\nconcert of a life-time with the\nMelbourne Symphony Orchestra in\nSydney. I 've got the record and I can't wait to see the concert. It should be\nutterly spectacular if you don't mind\nmissing a few more hours sleep, j Chris Jones\nSNAP\nTHEM UP!\nJim Jiminee\nMean Fiddler, Sun 27th Sept\nThrown into action by several good\nreviews in the press and the\nknowledge that the band were playing\nin College fairly soon I set off to see\nJim Jiminee (what a simply awful\nname) at my favourite LoifdoflVenue\nThe Mean Fiddler. Things did not go\nquite to plan as the man on the door\ntried to make me pay. Lost for words,\nI reached deep into my pocket and\npulled out my FELIX Press Card.\n'That will do nicely, Sir' was the cry\nas I strolled into the venue. I was not\nquite sure what to expect but, from\nthe moment this band hit the stage,\none could see they were very special.\nThey started at a speed which left\nmost of us standing, jumping and\njiving as they waved their rhythmic\nway through the first few numbers to\nthe delight of the audience and\nthemselves. People have compared\nthem to the House Martins but they\nlooked better, danced better and\nlaughed better. In fact there is little\ncause for comparison, bar the tongue\nin che aka capella song during which\nthe drummer terror is ed the audience\nwith his tam bor in e. The set ended all\ntoo soon with a jem of a single\nThursday (if you can't dance to it then\nyour feet must be nailed to the floor).\nThey made me jump, they made me\nswing but most of all they made me\nsmile. Snap them up!\nChris Jones\n18 Friday October 9th1987 FELIX\n\n"

The meeting is\nabout to start and there are 112\npeople. For those of you who don't know, the quorum of our UG Ms is\n300. I find the lack of interest in the\nUnion pathetic. Each year I have\nwatched the attendance diminish.\nEons ago, when I was a mere first\nyear, the first UG MI attended was\nwell publicised and quo rate. If you\nare a first year and didn't attend I would be interested to receive a letter\non why you had something better to\ndo. Did you know there was aUG M yesterday?

As the present policy stands,\nan 'external' publication must be\ncensored by the sabbaticals,\npublications board chairman and its\neditor and 'external' publication is\ndefined not in terms of its intended\nreadership, but where it is printed!\nThis is plainly stupid.

    "content": "The Untouchables\nMM-\u2022 \u2022\nJSC\nThe puritan ideal of banning all\nalcoholic liquor in the American\n1920s also gave rise to one of the\nworld's more famous gang lords; Al Capone. Charismatic in public and in\nprivate utterly ruthless, 'Scarface'\nCapone (Robert De Niro) owned\nChicago, from his lucrative monopoly\non illicit booze to the chief of police;\neveryone had their price. Until, that\nis, the arrival of one Eliot Ness\n(Kevin Costner) a federal agent who\nswore to 'get' Capone. Ness, together\nwith a small number of hand-picked\nofficers earned their title by being\nincorruptible and therefore out of\nCapone's control. Here the story\ndeparts from truth\u2014the only thing\nBrian De Palma's version has in\ncommon with Ness' own account of\nevents is the name. This however,\nshould not prevent enjoyment of this\nhigh-budget action-filled version of\nthe famous story; which incidentally\nlaunched another film and television\nseries of the same name that is\ncurrently being repeated.\nDespite the reworking of the true\nCapone story, many of the major\nHellraiser\nA small aesthetically pleasing cube of\noriental origin finds its way into the\npossession of Frank (Andrew\nRobinson), a man with a rather\nsadistic nature. Along with the cube\nFrank gains access to the pleasures of\nheaven or hell (his preference being\nthe latter) accompanied by a brigade\nof very odd beings, 'The Cenobites',\nto keep an eye on him.\nFrank's passion for the more\npainful and tortuous ways of having\nfun leads him to a thoroughly bloody\nand sticky end until a few drops of\nhis brother Larry's( Ashley Laurence)\nblood re vital is es his decaying body\nand he forces himself up through the\ngaps in the floorboards of the spare\nbedroom a mere skeleton (and slimy\nbits) of his former self. In the search\nfor human flesh, which he needs to\nmake his body whole again, he enlists\nhis sister-in-law Julia, who seems to\nfind compatible but slightly uncooperative donors for Frank's interesting style of body-building.\nWhen Kirsty (Clare Higgins), Larry's Daughter, discovers what's been\ngoing on in her dad's house she too\nbecomes pursued by the Cenobites.\nThis film took me slightly by\nsurprise when I went to the preview\nexpecting a teen-movie, fortunately it\nwas shown during the morning as this\nis the sort of film that makes me check\nunder my bed at night and has me\nlooking over my shoulder when\ndriving home from the cinema. The\nCenobites are pretty ghastly but I think the award for best make-up has\nto go to the half skin-clad Frank the\nearlier animated Frank is pretty\ndamned clever too. The best horror\nfilm I 've seen outranking The Thing.\nR.A. features are there; notably the lavish\nmeal where Capone graphically\ndemonstrates the finer points of\nbaseball, and the consequences of\nfailure. Where the story departs from\nfact is in the henchmen that Ness\nrecruits; Malone (Sean Connery) is a wise ned cop of the old guard, George\nStone (Andy Garcia) as the prodigy\nrookie and the unlikely accountant\nlooking into Capone's plentiful\nincome played by Charles Martin\nSmith.\nDe Niro is masterful in his\nportrayal of Capone; the explosive\ncharacter learned from Raging Bull\ncombined with the charisma from\nOnce Upon a Time in America form\nan imposing portrayal of the villain.\nConnery's Malone has a problem with\nhis Irish accent which quickly reverts\nto his native Scottish, but this should\nnot be allowed to spoil a dynamic\nsupporting role which almost steals\nthe show.\nIn the end De Palma's production\nbrings new life to a popular story\ngiving it a superior finish with lavish\nsettings for an often violent subject.\nA.N. The Night is Young\nThe Tragic and complex life of Alex\n(Denis Lavant), a young man who\nbecomes involved with the Parisian\nunderworld after the death of his\nfather, is seen against the harsh and\ndepressing streets of Paris. Alex had\npreviously made his living as a street\ngambler but decides to take the place\nof his father in a plot to steal a lifesaving serum (similar to a cure for\nAIDS) from a chemical company. His\ntwo accomplices are seen as tired old\nmen one of whom Marc (Michel\nPiccoli) has a young lover, Anna\n(Juliette Binoche). Alex falls in love\nwith Anna and this is where Leos\nCarax's moody direction comes into\nits own with some sensitive and\namusing scenes. An exciting car chase\nleads to a very appropriate if\nsomewhat violent climax.\nDon't be put off by the fact that this\nfilm is subtitled as very little of the\nappeal is in the spoken word but more\nin the atmosphere captured by the\nDirector\nR.A.

Tel: 0252 715372.\nDisgusting\ndissection\nDear Madam or Sir,\nI am writing a letter to your Student Union publication\nas I feel that many of your students, particularly first-years,\nwill appreciate a reminder about the use of animals in\nHigher and Further Education.\nLife Science students especially should note that at the\nend of the day they have the right to exercise conscientious\nobjection to dissecting or viv is ec ting animals. There are\nan ever-growing number of students who have profound\nethical objections to a qui esc ing in the killing of innocent,\nsentient creatures, particularly when non-animal teaching\nmethods are available, for example, models and computer\ngraphics.\nUnfortunately, it is the case that unsympathetic academic\n!\nstaff may try to press u rise students to dissect, or, more\nlikely, will mark students down for not doing practicals,\neven when they offer to do alternative (non-animal) work.\nBut such students deserve the full backing of their\nStudents' Union if victimised in this way, particularly since\nthe National Union of Students, at its last Conference,\nagreed to uphold students' rights to \"Violence-Free\nScience\".\nIn addition, at its April AGM, the National Council for\nCivil Liberties agreed to campaign, where possible, to\nsupport a student's right to object on moral grounds to\ndissection.\nAny student who is facing difficulties, and/or academic\npenalties, for refusing to dissect or viv is ect should contact\nNUS, N CCL or my own organisation.\nYours faithfully,\nDominic Johnson, BUAV, Group Co-or d in at or Clubs page II\nDear Judith,\nThe Positive Alternatives to Abortion Society exists to\ntell students the truth about abortion and to promote the\npositive alternatives. I would like to inform the new\nstudents at Imperial about PATA and also continue the\nbeneficial discussion about abortion which took place last\nyear, as witnessed by FELIX' s letter page.\nAmong PAT A's events last year were several talks given\nat IC. They were given by prominent members of the\nmedical profession and the 'Life Movement', including\na victim of abortion. Next year's plans will be more\nambitious. They need to be! At a time when the\nGovernment is at last showing a willingness to listen to\nMembers of Parliament and members of the public on this\nissue, it is sad to find many people who know not only\nvery little about the unborn child but also about abortion\nas it is practiced today.\nLast year 172,286 abortions were performed in clinics\nin England and Wales, most of which fell into one category\nonly. Of these 168,732 were due to \"risk of injury to\nphysical or mental health of women\". This category does\nnot include those cases in which the mother's life is at\nrisk and the number of rape victims here is very low perhaps a dozen. To put this into context, the second\nlargest category is of abortions due to \"risk of injury to\nphysical or mental health of existing child(ren)\" and\nnumbers 16,176. Abortion has become a legitimate form\nof family planning. This is despite the dawn of 'Post\nAbortion Syndrome' which seems to undermine the object\nbehind this type of birth control by making the mother\nve ty unhappy.\nIf any readers feel that they do not know enough about\nthe subject they are welcome to attend any of our events\nplanned for the year. Those who want to do something\ntruly worthwhile this year might consider joining.\nOur 'Cheese and Wine' is at 1.00pm, Thurs 15th, Senior\nCommon Room, Union Building.\nYours,\nMathew Soane,\nChairman, Maths II.\nIt is quite right that you should try to bring attention\nto your club in FELIX but please do not do it in the\nform of a letter. The letters page is for informed opinion and debate. Such letters as yours deserve to be\non the clubs page. The next letter trying to promote\na club will be swiftly dispatched to my Clubs Editor.\nThus spake the Editor.\nFELIX Friday October 9th198715 "

    "content": "FELIX More than\na holiday\nIt's very easy to forget that the long\nsummer vacation\u2014a clear three\nmonths of freedom to do what you\nwill\u2014is a highly finite resource. Few\npeople ever again have such\nopportunities once the demands of a career and of family responsibilities\nbecome major factors in life. For\nmore than thirty years, Imperial\nCollege Exploration Board has\nencouraged students to consider a particularly rewarding, not to say\nexotic, way of using this time\u2014by\nparticipation in expedition activity.\nThere is scarcely a region on the\nearth's surface which has not been\ntraversed by one means or another by\nImperial College expeditions and\nmany hundreds of students have\neffort, we have organised a series of\nthree illustrated lectures as part of the\nHumanities Department's Tuesday\nLunchtime Lecture Programme.\nThe three speakers this year are as\nfollows:\nTues 13th Oct\nRob Palmer\u2014'The Andros Project'\nMr Palmer is one of the country's leading cave divers and he is Director\nof the 1987 International Blue Holes\nResearch Project in the Bahamas,\nwhich is the subject of his talk.\nTuesday 20th Oct\nAndy Fanshawe\u2014'The Conquest of\nthe Chogolisa Peaks'\nMr Fanshawe is the National Office\nof the British Mountaineering\nCouncil.

This summer, for\nexample, we have five groups of\nstudents in the field\u2014climbing\nAlaska's highest mountain, making an\nextensive road survey across Africa,\nmaking an underwater pollution study\nin the Red Sea, carrying out a bird\nfauna study in the Cameroon,\nsurveying land-slide incidence and\nmountaineering in the East\nKarakoram. Those of us closely\ninvolved in the Exploration Board's work are totally convinced that this\nsort of activity is in the best sense of\nthe word educational since it\ninvariably deepens people's understanding of the world, and of\nthemselves. It is also terrific fun.\nFor some years now, as an\nimportant aspect of our publicity\nCollege and is widely regarded as one\nof Britain's top climbers.\nTues 27th Oct\nPaul Munton\u2014'The Oman Wahiba\nSands Project'\nDr Munton was the Biological\nResources Director of the Royal\nGeographical Society's prestigious\nand multi-disciplinary expedition\nwhich took place in 1985/86 and\nwhich is widely regarded as a major\ncontribution to the systematic study\nof desert regions.\nAll these talks will be in the Read\nLecture Theatre, Fifth Floor, Sherfield Building, at 1.15pm Don Adlington is the Student\nCouncellor.

Those of you\nwith good memories may well\nremember the band from two years\nback at the Guilds Carnival. They\nwore suits and ties and per for emd a set full of band dance rhythms and\nnimble foot-work. Well today the\nsuits have gone in favour of the look\nof 87 (circa Curiosity, Wet Wet Wet)\nbut the music remains as does the\nfoot-work. With two slots in Melody\nMaker in the last five weeks, one\nsenses they have a few people on their\nside, the last single Magic Girl was\ncoined \" an effortless stroll of a genuine pop single...\". No doubt\nmore acclaim will follow with two\nmore singles and an album in the next\nfew months so why not come along\nand see for yourself. Doors open at\n9pm for \u00a31 in advance.

This\nincident has caused a lot of ill-feeling\nin the IC Union Office and so I'd like\nto put forward my view as a semi-also be questioned. Firstly, the\nHitsquad tried to hit Alan Rose, who\nwears glasses, secondly no enquiries\nwere made to find out if anyone wore\ncontact lenses and thirdly no money\nwas raised. These tend to show that\nthe Hitsquad is definitely lacking in\nindependent onlooker. Guild's Hitsquad is part of Guilds' Rag and\nthey raise money by being contracted\nto 'hit' people. Just recently the\ncontrol of the Hitsquad had been very\nlax and consequently they have\noverstepped the mark on a number of\noccasions, Monday was one such\noccasion. The rules by which the\nHitsquad operate state that they can\nonly flan people during Rag Week,\nin the past fl anning has occured at\nother times but this has only been\ntolerated by IC Union, not condoned.\nMonday's activities have certainly put\npay to any more Union tolerance. The\nway the attack was carried out must\ncontrol and accountability. The Union\nExec met on Wednesday and the\nquestion of the Hitsquad was raised.\nAt the time of writing the result of that\nmeeting is not known but the feeling\nin the Union Office on Monday was\nthat the Hitsquad should be banned.\nI feel that this would be a shame but\nI do agree that the time has come for\ngreater control. As the person who\nproposed Dave Tyler for the post of\nGuilds Union President I hope he will\nmake this his own personal\nresponsibility and ensure that in future\nall Hitsquad rules are adhered to.\nNigel D Baker, Rag Chairman\nHon Sex\nHalls Insurance\nCheques are waiting in my office for\nthe following people:\nHassan Majid\nP Alwick\nH Bramwell\nP Nunasinghe\nThese can be collected now, but\nremember to bring identification.\nLate Night Drinking\nFor those of you who didn't apply for\nstudent membership to Third Street\nnightclub at Freshers' Fair, I have\napplication forms in my office.

    "content": "This week in past years, FELIX has\nbeen filled with the same old stories\nabout Fresher's Week (or whatever\nthe equivalent at the time was) and\nassorted introductions to College.\nMixed in with these: stories of new\nbuildings (the \"new main entrance to\nCity and Guilds\",1964), shoddy\nworkmanship (the Union gymnasium), and lack of\naccommodation. Speaking of\naccommodation, how do you like this\nlittle gem, regarding the acquisition\nof the leases of eight flats in Hamlet\nGardens in 1971: \" The flats are in\nexcellent condition and are generally\nbetter than those that students would\nnormally find.'' See last week's FELIX for developments since then...\nThe edition in which this is\nreported, was incidentally, the first\none to be issued free. Before this, the\nfortnightly copy of FELIX had cost\nthe princely sum of 6d, or 2'/2p. It\nwas an interesting edition in other\nrespects too; Piers Corbyn (a latter\nday Trotsky?) was then a post\ngraduate student at IC, and making\nbig news. This week the story is of\nhow he fended off the College's attempts to get rid of him, presumably\nbecause of his political activities, by\nwithdrawing his grant. Turning to the\nback page for the rest of this\ngruesome tale, you see the headline\n\" Corby n Busted\". During the\nsummer the flat of the much harrassed\nCorbyn had been raided by the drugs\nsquad, who found \u00a32 worth of hash.\nThe luckless student was promptly\narrested, and for good measure\naccused of handling stolen\nproperty\u2014one traffic cone, one\nroadside lamp, and one local authority\nsign concerning dogs and footpaths.\nBut enough about Corbyn. This\nwas not the only excursion into crime\non the pages of FELIX. In 1958 we\nfind the case of the missing MG Magnette in which, for once, an IC\nstudent welcomed the intervention of\nthe police. The car, borrowed from\nhis father, disappeared when the\nstudent was sitting for an exam.\nSuspecting a student prank, he made\na painstaking search of the area before\ninforming the police. But the car was\nused for the getaway after two men\nstole \u00a37000 in a violent robbery.\nWeeks later the car was found,\ndamaged and abandoned, and the\nculprits were found. The student\nappeared as a witness at the\npreliminary trial, at which, he\ncomplained, he was treated with less\nrespect than the prisoners.\nExploration and climbing occupied\nP.G.

However, fifteen months later\nthe Mount Everest Foundation and\nCollege's Exploration Board had seen\nonly a700 word report for the \u00a31000\nand \u00a33052 they had, respectively,\ndonated.\nOn a more tragic note, FELIX in\n1964 announces the death in a climbing accident of a member of IC\nMountaineering Club.

Other stories filling out the\npages included the College refectories\nmaking the biggest loss in their\nhistory, and the sending out to first\nyear students of questionnaires about\ntheir consumption of alcohol (by the\nLondon University's Institute of\nPsychiatry, not IC's Welfare\nCommittee).

The money will be held by an independent trust which\nwill invest the money on the Union's behalf, yielding a possible return\nof \u00a3400,000 per annum. The proceeds will be used to finance a new sports\ncomplex at South Kensington.\nThe decision was taken at a meeting\nof the College Finance and Executive\nCommittee on September 15th, when\nthe Union presented historical\nevidence demonstrating that the\nprofits from Harlington belong to the\nUnion not the College. Until recently\nthe College investments Committee\nhad been holding the money in a bank\naccount, the interest from which had\nbeen siphoned off to ease the\nCollege's cash flow problems.\nAfter three months of Union\nresearch it was revealed that the\nproceeds from the gravel should have\nbeen invested by the Investments\nCommittee for \"the improvement of\nstudent facilities in South\nKensington\". It also became apparent\nthat the income should have been\ncontrolled by the College Athletics\nCommittee on which the Union has\nmajority representation, and not the\nCollege's Finance and Executive\nCommittee.\nThese findings were accepted by\nthe Finance and Executive meeting in\nSeptenber and the ICU President is\ncurrently negotiation g with College\nSecretary John Smith to decide how\nthe money should best be invested.\nBecause of the Union's charitable\nstatus, half of the money can be\nplaced in low risk speculative\ninvestments, whilst the remainder\nmust be spent on steady growth\ninvestments such as unit trust share\nholdings.\nA panoramic view of Ian Bull\nA body of former students and\nmembers of the Governing Body will\nbe placed in charge of the trust to\ninvest the funds on behalf of the\nUnion.

Under the terms of the\ntrust, the Union will be able to spend\nthe returns from the investments, and\nwill also withdraw lump sums for the\nRobbed!\nThe penthouse flat of the Tizard and\nSelkirk warden was broken onto last\nSunday.

    "content": "News No motion\nThe first IC Union General Meeting\nof the year was held yesterday in the\nGreat Hall. The start of the meeting\nwas delayed while ICU Honorary\nSecretary, Chas Jackson, brought in\nthe papers for the meeting. In\nprevious years the first U GM has\nalways been well-attended but this\nyear only 112 people attended the\nmeeting.\nThe first motion, on Union policy\nwas passed unchallenged. A motion\non censorship of publications was to\nbe proposed by Publications Board\nChair, Chris Martin, but ICU President, Ian Howgate, proposed a number of amendments. Although the\namendments were passed, the motion\nwas eventually deferred' to the next\nmeeting.\nNeil Motteram, ICU External\nAffairs Officer, proposed a motion on\nthe right of silence. He said that the\nremoval of the right to remain silent\nwas a serious infringement of civil\nliberties. Paul Kendall opposed the\nmotion, claiming that those suspected\nof terrorist offences would be more\nlikely to be convicted if the fact that\nthey had remained silent was\nadmissible in court. On the vote, the\nmotion was carried by substantial\nmajority.\nThe final motion was proposed by\nIan Howgate, on the subject of\nintercollegiate halls. He said that the\nhalls were too extravagant in both\ntheir facilities and in the numbers of\nstaff employed to run them. He cited\nthe University of London Management Audit section report on\nthe rational is ation of the halls.\nOpposing the motion, Paul McNeill\nfrom Hughes Parry Hall said that the\nmotion was factually inaccurate and\nthat the Management Audit Report\nhad been rejected by a meeting of\nstudents from all the halls. The\nmotion was narrowly defeated.\nMonday night's New Year's Party has been described as a great success\nby the Ents Chairperson John Noble.\nHeadline band, Voice of the Beehive and supports, The Brilliant Corners\nand Blue Aeroplanes were given \"excellent receptions\" by the 1,140 students\nwho attended.\nMr Noble praised the behaviour of the crowd for their lack of drunken ess and v omitting, and apologised for the blockage in the ladies toilets, which\nhe claimed was not his fault.\nBF tI No salvation\nSalvation Sunday, the support band\ndue to perform tonight at the\nFreshers' Ball, have broken up, it was\nrevealed exclusively to FELIX yesterday. A new support has been\narranged by Entertainments\nChairman, John Noble, who was\ndevastated by the news. The new\nband, World TV, reached notoriety\nwhen their lead singer auditioned for\nFrankie Goes to Hollywood this\nSpring.\nTrust gift\nAt Fresher's Fair last Tuesday,\nCollege secretary John Smith named\na new boat for the Union boat club.\nThe boast was party paid f pr by the\nCollege's Queen's Gate trust, after\nwhich it was named. The boat was\nbought by the club from the winning\nOxford boat race team, who were\nbeaten by Imperial College in a match\nlast year.\nExec draw blood\nShaving foam flew and tempers flared\nat the Freshers' reception on Monday.\nTrue to form, the City and Guilds Hit\nSquad turned up during the\nPresident's address and flan ned the\nUnion Executive. Later, at\nWednesday's meeting of the Exec,\nwhich includes the three C CU Presidents as well as the sabbaticals,\nit ws decided to re-think the rules\ngoverning fl anning. The Exec have\nimposed a 'fine' of fifty pints of\nblood, which the Hit Squadders must\npay before they are allowed to strike\nagain.\nFreshers' reception has become a regular target for the Hit Squad, and\nthey are not always well received.\nLast year the Union Exec were\nangered by afl anning because prior\npermission had not been sought.\nThough this is not normally required\nunder the unwritten rules of fl anning, when students are the target, on that\noccasion members of Imperial\nCollege staff had also been hit.\nUnion Deputy President Alan Rose\nand Hon Sec Chas Jackson retaliated\nwhen the hit occurred and pinned one\nof the Guildsmen to the ground. Both\nofficers had been expecting the Hit\nSquad to arrive; Mr Jackson later\ncommented that this type of incident\nwas very bad for the image of ICU, especially when fresher s had only just\narrived at College. Mr Jackson added\nthat, as the Hit Squad had not\ncollected any donations, no money\nhad been raised for charity.\nThe reaction from Mr Rose and Mr Jackson has soured feelings within the\nGuilds Hit Squad. One eloquent\nGuildsman commented that he was\n\"pissed off\". He expanded the\ndiscussion to say that \"it would put\npeople off joining the Hit Squadders\nand give fresher s the impression that\nthey can fight back\".\nICU President Ian Howgate told\nFELIX that he would not have\nobjected to being hit had he been\ngiven advance warning. In the event\nhe was wearing an Italian suit worth\n\u00a3140. Mr Howgate is paid \u00a33,300 per\nannum after tax and National\nInsurance have been deducted, plus\na rent free room in Linstead Hall. He\nexpressed concern that the Hit Squad\nhad made a \"real mess\" of the stage\narea. Mr Jackson stated that the stage\nhad not been properly cleaned up for\nthe postgraduate Freshers' reception,\nbut this was denied by Guilds\nPresident Dave Tyler. Mr Tyler\nclaimed that he was not aware that the\nhit was going to take place; it was at\nhis instigation that the Exec imposed\nthe fine of fifty pints of blood.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publication Board and is printed by the Imperial College\nUnion Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London, SW72 BB( Tel 01-589 5111 ext 3515).

    "content": "The University of London Union\n( UL U) is much more than a swimming pool and a shop in Malet\nStreet. It has three full time sabbatical\nofficers responsible for running the;\nbuilding, and co-ordinating the l campaigning and representation side\nof UL U's activities. In charge for this\nyear is John Tilsead, student at St.\nMary's Hospital Medical School and\nPresident of UL U. John was elected to his year-long\nsabbatical in March, with a manifesto\nthat began \"Riot, Rebellion and\nRevolution\". This was a play on the\n\" 3 Rs\" campaign that UL U was\nfighting at the time. The University\nGrants Commission ( UGC) had\nproposed a50% cut in the funding of\nall the central services of the\nUniversity, including UL U, and UL U was lobbying both the University and|\nthe UGC to change their minds, j The 3 Rs stood for Recreation,;\nResources and Representation, three\nwords which neatly sum up the role\nof UL U in the Federal University.\nThe fight was eventually won, and the\nthreat of cuts withdrawn. It was, John\nadmits, UL U's first on-the-streets\nsuccessful campaign; \"it got UL U away from just representing students\non committees, and got students out\non the streets. It triggered an\nawareness of UL U as a campaigning\nbody. A lot of people put a lot of time\nand energy into the 3Rs campaign; I want to see that energy used to steer\nUL U on a path of perhaps greater\nrelevance to its members.\"\nThe follow-up to the campaign is\na document produced by UL U called\n\" The Future of Student Amenities in\nthe Federal University\". It shows that\nspending per student on Student\nActivities in London is considerably\nlower than other Universities\nthroughout the country, even taking\ninto account the combined services of\nUL U and the individual Colleges.\n' 'The report has been submitted to all\nthe University Committees, and it has\nnot been questioned; we will be using\nthat to continue the 3Rs campaign,\ncoming off the defensive, and going\nonto the attack. We will use the\ninformation in the report to campaign\nfor better student facilities, better\naccommodation, better sports\nfacilities, not just centrally but\nthroughout the University.\"\nJohn is optimistic that the report\nwill have an effect: \"I doubt whether\nwe will solve all the problems that\nhave accrued over years of diverting\nfunding away from student services,\nbut I think we can realistically expect\nto start the ball rolling.\"\nOne of UL U's main roles is\nrepresenting students on the Central\nCommittees that decide policy for the\nwhole University, on such issues as\nTHE ff clU* INTERVIEW examinations policy, postgraduate\nappeals, mergers and so on. It is only\nthrough UL U that students have a voice in these decisions. These\ncommittees are made up from\nacademics from throughout the\nUniversity, as well as lay members\nfrom Local Authorities and the Privy\nCouncil. \"It is not unusual for the\nstudent representation on a Committee to be greater than any\nindividual College, but\", he adds,\n\" we can no longer afford to argue\nfrom ideals and beliefs, but we have\nto argue on facts. What we very often\nfind now is that we end up arguing\nthe same thing, but it takes longer to\ndo. By doing this we strengthen our\nargument, and the other members of\nthe committee will respect it.\"\nClearly, with UL U based in the\nCentral Precinct, there is a danger that\nother Colleges smaller and ft irt her out\nwill be left out. \" Over the past year\nwe have had a lot of support from\nWye and Royal Holloway and\nBedford, the two Colleges furthest\naway; very often what we find is that\nbecause the Student Union hacks from\nsome Colleges don't use UL U they\nassume that nobody from their\nCollege does; a generalisation thay\ncannot afford to make\". It is true\nhowever that through sheer numbers,\nmore students use UL U from the\nlarger Colleges than the smaller ones,\nespecially those living in the.\nintercollegiate halls based nearby.\nJohn is realistic about some\nservices, like the swimming pool, that\nUL U provides; \"there is no point in\ntrying to kid ourselves that it's there\nfor students from Egham; those are\nthe sort of people however, that UL U should be providing campaigning\nresources and co-ordination for;\npassing on experience from other\nColleges and generally providing,\nback-up.\"\nOne criticism UL U has had in the\npast is that it has been too remote\nfrom the actual students of the\nUniversity; there are no students who\nhave lectures at UL U; none who are\nbased there full time. UL U officers\nare elected indirectly by delegates\nfrom each Constituent College. \"One\nof the problems we have to get over\nis that we are at least one tier away.\nVery often individual College Student\nUnions are out of touch with their\nmembership; it's even more difficult\nto be in touch with the average\nstudent. There is no way I can know\nevery student in the University. We\nrely very much on individual Student\nUnions to get over this problem; if\nStudent Union officers are in touch\nwith their students, and we are in\ntouch with them, then the problem is\nalleviated somewhat, but it really is\na problem\"\nThe UL U Governing Body, General Union Council (GUC) has\nstudent delegates from every College\nin the University. Imperial, as one of\nthe largest, has 9 representatives. This\nis the body which sets policy for\nUL U, and elects its Officers. It has\noften been criticised for discussion of\nissues that are not immediately\nrelevant to students; recent motions\non Cyprus and South Africa for\nexample. John defends such\ndiscussions: \"the motions that come\nto GU C have come from some group\nof students who think the issue is\nparticularly relevant. The problem\nover Cyprus is something that is very\nparticular to Cypriot, Greek and\nTurkish students, it means a great deal\nto them and I think it is something that\nshould be debated.\"\n\" GU C has two functions: to\ndetermine things concerning the\nUniversity, but it also has an\neducation role by bringing subjects,\nsuch as Cyprus, into a forum for\ndebate and increasing awareness\namongst student Union officers that\nthey might not have thought about.''\nJohn stood for the post because, he\nsays, he wants to steer UL U towards\ngreater relevance for its students. As head of one of the largest Student\nUnions in Europe, representing over\n50,000 students, he certainly has a heavy weight on his shoulders; only\ntime will tell if he can succeed.\nFor further information about\nUL U, John can be contacted either by\ncalling in at his office on the ground\nfloor of the UL U building, or by\nphoning UL U on 580 9551.\n8 Friday October 9th1987 FELIX\n\n"

Derek was\nsitting in his office at the top of the Surefield\nfortress, and for once he was feeling very\npleased with himself. Only an hour ago he had\nhad to welcome another group of citizens who\nhad just arrived in the land of Cheapskate.\nWhen the time came for Derek to make his\nspeech he had managed to read the words from\nthe large boards at the back of the hall without\nstopping once. He had not even had to ask John\nSecretary, the chief typist, to tell him what any of the words were. Derek\ndid not see why he had to read from the boards at the back of the hall;\nhe really wanted to copy it out and read it from a piece of paper, but John\nSecretary had assured him that it was traditional to use the same boards\nthat were made when the speech was first written many generations ago.\nThe more Derek thought about it, the more he realised that there was\nreally no point in making the speech at all. Though he agreed that it was\nvery nice for all the new citizens to be told what a wonderful place\nCheapskate was, and how it was so good that they really ought to be\nvery proud that they were allowed even to pa'ya short visit, he did not\nsee a lot of point in saying things that had been printed in the Cheapskate\nCircumspectus for years and years.\nMeanwhile, in another part of Cheapskate, there was still lots happening\nin the Citizens' office. Ian Whygate, the head Citizen, his Deputy, Alan\nEgo, and Charles Takeiteasy, the citizen-in-charge-of-nothing-very-much,\nwere all working at their jobs. As usual Whygate had his mouth in top\ngear but had forgotten to engage his brain and his ears (not that it would\nhave made much difference). He was talking to John Chivalrous, the\nCitizens' Parties Chairman, who had dared to tell Judith Largeamounts,\nthe PHALIX editor, that Whygate was a complete prat. Whygate was very\ncross about this; he was always upset when PHALIX printed anything other\nthan \"Ian Howgate is a100% nice person\". Whygate had decided that\nit was a very bad thing for PHALIX not be under his control. He wanted\nto be able to tell Judith Largeamounts exactly what she should put in\nPHALIX. Recently he had made up his mind that, as top citizen, he should\nbe making all the decisions and leaving all the hard work to ordinary\ncitizens. Earlier that day he had told Custard Johnson, the citizen in charge\nof beer, that he was going to rule the world. Custard's only reaction was\nto ask where Whygate bought his dope.\nEgo, the Deputy Head Citizen, was trying to calm down Lesley Tantrum,\nthe former rent collector. Tantrum had been replaced by Arthur Michael,\nthe good-but-good-for-nothing fairy, after she had forgotten to send\nmessages to all the new citizens to tell them which of Cheapskate's dormitories they were supposed to live in. Arthur Michael had been rent\ncollector many years ago, but nowadays he spent most of his time plotting\nto take over from the all-powerful John Secretary. None of the dormitories\nin Yorrick Gardens had been cleaned up for the new citizens, so Arthur\nMichael was preparing his \"you should be grateful for this very cheap\ndormitory we are letting you live in\" routine. This normally worked very\nwell, and none of the important people in the Baron's castle ever\ncomplained about him.\nCharles Takeiteasy was having a more difficult time than usual. Earlier\nin the day one of the citizens from very far away had come in to complain\nthat he had not received a copy of the \"Citizens' Guide to Cheapskate\"\nbook, Takeiteasy had not known what to do and was about to go and\nask Mrs Jolly Hockey Sticks for advice when the three clowns, Clare\nMacUseless, Dave Braincell and Jumping Jehosofat stumbled into the\ncitizens' office. \"Hello de aries\", said Mrs Jolly Hockey Sticks, pleased\nto have some more interesting company, \"let's have a glass of sherry\".\nWith a gleam in her eye, she grasped the keys and advanced towards the\nsherry cupboard.\nWill the sherry bottle be empty?\nWill Whygate be allowed to have any?\nWill PHALIX ever say anything nice about Arthur Michael?\nFind out in the next installment of \"The Baron\".\nFELIX Friday October 9th1987 J7 "
