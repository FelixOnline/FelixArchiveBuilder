    "content": "2 FELIX\nPROFILE is. sum\nJohn ia the rather rotund figure who has\nbeen the unobtrusive but guiding hand on Felix\nthis year. All of you will remember the\n\"Freshers' Felix\", which was sold on the first day of last term, and on the three pre o ee ding days. Few of you will realize the tremendous\namount of work wh i oh John did to make it sue ha success. The record sale speaks for his\norganising ability, and energy.\nHe refused to say where he was born, but\nhe was brought up in Minehead, Zummerzet, where\nhe broke his nose. In John's own words, \"It\nhappened when I fell out of my pram after being\nbitten by a dog!\" In Minehead he went to a co-ed school, but didn't like it, and left at\nthe early age of sixteen to become aM.O.S. apprentice at Malvern.\nAfter working on radar equipment for a couple of years, he came to Guilds in1951 as\na first year electrical engineer. For the\nnext two years, John said he was a brown-b agger singing as a tenor in the Imperial College\nChoir, and working as a conscientious helper on\nFelix. He played rugby, but a slipped disc in his spine brought a premature cessation to his\nathletic pursuits. Still an active oh or is ter, John is a pillar of the tenors. At all Felix\nmeetings, hl3 advice is.valued. He is a member\nof the sedate body known as the Residents'\nCommittee, through which he now owns the largest\nbed in the Old Hostel.\nHis likes? Well, these are many and var-i ed, but amongst the more predominant are music,\nboth classical and contemporary, Valerie, and the\nquietness of the fifth floor of the Old Hostel.\nHe says that he dislikes work, but the\nintricate structure with which he labours as a post-graduate has received regular attention at\nhis hands. Confidentially, John HATED writing\nEditorials. He invariably left these till the\nlast minute, in the hope that news could go ill the column instead I SWEET THAMES RUN SOFTLY.\nShivering on the hard at Chiswiok under the\nunfriendly eyes of U.C,L. S.E. and the rest, stand\nfive frail Icwarians. These are the dauntless\nfew who chose to row and braved the storm of disapproval from Putney. And how, you may ask, is the I.C. W.B. C.o ox ed four faring\" The answer is quite simple - we're doing all right. We haven't put on pounds of muscle, our hands are only very\nslightly blistered and we haven't fallen in( yet!).\nThe initial difficulties have now been sur-.\nmounted and we were very glad to receive some good\ncoaching during this period. Now, after tanking\nand tub bing, we have ventured out in a clinker.\nNone of us care to remember the first time - we\nmust have resembled an agitated water beetle, but\nwe kept afloat. The second time out there was an\nimmense Improvement and all Is now set fair. Except - doesn't anyone want to coach us?\nr.c w. FORMAL DANCE IN AY RT ON ON HALL Fri. April.2.9 th9 ao^,2 an a*. Tickets:1/6 dka-AV*/\nBuffet. 8a \u00ab. B* nd.\nHOUSE PARTIES\nSleeping in the bedrooms, sleeping in the\nbarn, and in the games room - and even in the\nlocal Youth Hostel - Two hot water bottles, and\nton blankets - Everybody welcome. Come In, if you can get In'. Such was the spirit of the two\nwinter house parties run by the I.C. Christian\nUnion.\nIn the days when many societies have good\ncause to complain of student apathy and disinter-est, It Is a pleasant change to find a committee\nrunning round in circles to accommodate a demand\nfar exceeding anything in previous years. About\nfifty people took part on each occasion, and a very helpful and enjoyable time was had by all. Washing up, and pleasant company were by kind cooperation of a small party from Q.E. C. Christian\nUnion.\nOur host at the second party was Mr. Metcalfe\nCollier, by now a well known figure at I.C. Many of us had cause to be grateful for the help\nand advice of a man with 33 years of vital Christian living behind him. He spoke to us on\n\"The Second Coming of Christ.\" The fact that\nthis event Is coming as surely as the June examinations was clearly set forth, and with it the\nage-old call of the Gospel. To those apart from\nGod, the call to reconciliation, - to the Christian, the call to a holy and consecrated life. The value of these house part les can only be\nmeasured in terms of our answer to this call. LC.W.A. EXPECTS\nOpinions recorded at a hostel coffee party:\nClothing:\nIt ia funny the things man wear.\nClothes look better on men than on women.\nYou want to be like the Germans; they don't wear pyjamas.\nI prefer the French system.\nThis IS iran aral. Let's talk about something also.\nMan:\nKen are always irresponsible when they are together.\nSo few of than eon hold any drink at all. I don't knew anything a a out men.\nMines ia like I.C.

We thanked\nour host* and retained to Newport in time for the 7.20\ntrain to London. After fifteen minutes wait everybody\nwas becoming a little restive and it was a relief for\nthe station master when the train arrived, greeted ay\nthe roar of a Boomalaka. In spite of arriving nearly\nan hour late at Paddingten, credit is due to British\nRailways for the first class dinner that waa served.\nShsnry and beer were also provided - in fact instead\nof taking part in the usual pub crawl it appeared that we wore in a crawling pub! Our benefactors oe rta in ly know the best way to a Guildaman'a heart. One theory explaining the slow progress of the\ntrain. Was that the insulation paper, streaming from\nthe windows, had wound round the axles of the coaches.\nThe party rolled out of the coaches at T0.45 p.m. and\nfinished the day with another Xoomalaka.\nIt is with pleasure that we will r \u2014sm ber what\nan st have boon the most lavish visit ever offered to\nthe Inginserlng Society.\nD.I.*.

    "content": "6 FELIX UL CHAMPIONSHIPS HEAD OF THE RIVER-PREVIEW.\nWhen instituting the Head of the River Race fro. Mortlake\nto Putney (the reverse Boat Race course) in 1926, Steve Pairbairn wrote that this race would \"do mare for rowing than anything has done yet.\" By 1930, eighty crews were racing and\nthe number has steadily increased until today there are 230\ncrews entered in both \"best\" and clinker built boats.\nThe winners of the first race in 1926 were London R.O. and apart from sharing the Head with Thames R.C. the following\nyear, they remained champions until 1935- Imperial College\nBoat Club had the honour of being the first oo lle ge crew to\n\"go Head\" in 1946, beating Jesus College, (Cambridge) who\nreversed the position in 1947 end won again in t951 and 1952.\nThis year the race will be rowed tomorrow Saturday, 19th March and the I. C.B.C. has entered its first nine crews to\nrow the 4< miles. Last year's finishing positions were 8th,28 th,79 th,119 th,158 th,195 th,212 th,221 st, the ninth crew\nbeing one of the new entries wh i oh start in alphabetical order\nat the back.\nThe competition for the Headship t his year is keen.\nThe. R.A.F. crew (the present holders) are very fit and will\nbo making every effort to stay \"out in front.\" The Thames\nand London crews are fast, the Thames crew being credited with\nsome very fast times in bad conditions. The other college -Jesus, have gone Head in the Lent Bumps on the Cam and will\nbe stiff opposition.\nThe 1.0. first VIII, with plenty of power and ability at\nits disposal, although slightly lacking in \"togetherness\",\nhave great spirit and determination in spite of (or because\nof) the many setbacks this term. Having some 450 miles of\nhard work to their credit and the shook of seeing the films\nof the Staines trip still fresh in their memory, their faults\nare rapidly disappearing and with their present rate of improvement they look like justifying the pains of the coach.\nAny success of the first VIII will be shared by that plucky\nteam of lightweights, the second VIII who have not spared themselves in their efforts to be the fastest I.C. crew and who\nh' re given the big chaps some uneasy times earlier this year.\nA very neat or ew with all the guts in the world, they will be\nexp eot ed in the first division. The third VIII, who have\nalready showed their ability against their opposite number at\nReading University, will go up. Likewise the fourth VIII\nand the fresher crews who are promising material display that\nelusive quantity - club spirit. In general, the lower boats\nhave their own private battles fighting to go from Nth to\n(N10th) or better and as the tendency is to follow the\nupper boats - 'nuff said.\nWe wish all the cox es good luck; theirs is the headache\nbut they can do so much to bring the boys home those few\nseconds earlier by their spirit, keene s s and ability, to say\nnothing of the course they steer.\nTo Kim Ash, (the Captain) and to the Club let us say\n\"Have a0oc row, with all of your share of good luck*.\nCRICKET.\nI.C. Crioket Club will be holding practice matches\nnets and trials at Harlington at 2.30 pm oni-Saturday, 23rd April.\nMonday, 25th April.\nWednesday, 27th April.\nOn the club notice -board in the Union there are\nnotices which should be Rigned by fresher s and 'old'\nmembers who wish to play this season.\nALL aHK UtiSLCOMJi I The clubs first matches are on April 30th against\nformidable opponents in Heading University.\nIt is hoped that people who played in last years\nfirst team will be available for practice during\nthe mornings of April 23rd and 25th. \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 . \u2014 - \u2014 . \u2014\nJUDO\nI.C.9 pts. Hatfield T.C.5p ts.0a paper the Hatfield team was much stronger than leC'S but on the mats I \u00bbC. proved to be the more 3kill ful and\nexperienced team. Burford gave a good example of this by\nusing a KAEShTWAZA to a KUZURE-KAtfI3HIH0GA.TAl*E that he\nlearnt when the team visited the Metropolitan Polios. This\nsurprised both his opponent and the referee, J.G \u00bbBarnes,\nChairman of the British Judo Association.\nThe other three members of the team all ^Jpwgat wall.\nWilliams surprising all by convincingly beating Til a. ib) f fim graded opponent.\n/. C. WIN U.L.7 ASIDES.\nBBLL GETS THE BALL BACK TO LE MARQUAND IN THE QUARTER FINAL.\nOn Saturday last I.C.I romped home victors of the University Seven-a Sides tournament at Hotspur Park. After the\nearly dismissal of I.C. II at the hands of Q. M.C.I the\nfirst seven,ably led by Fontin were able to show their true\nworth and reached the final by defeating Vets 16-0, Goldsmiths i90 and Westminster by a goal to a penalty goal.\nIn the Final which was played before the crowded Hotspur Park\ngrandstand I.C. met Kings. After taking a couple of minutes\nto settle down I.C. attacked time and again until Fontin went\nover for an un converted try. After the interval Beambroke\nthrough for the second try but a defensive lapse allowed King's to score under the posts thus gaining their only 3 pts. I.C. now attacked relentlessly and further tries from Pontin and\nCorlett. the former being converted by Hearn ga v oI.C. the\ndecisive victory of 1lf pts. to 3 pts. This fine performance\nwas essentially a combined effort but mention must be made of\nthe fine breaks of Le Marquand at sorum-half and of the strong\nrunning of Palmer when given the ball.\nAt the Rugger Danoe in the evening the cup was presented\nto Pontin after wh i oh harassed barmen lost count of the number\nof times it was drained of its contents by a team wh i oh had\nnow made drastic changes in its training diet programme.\nSAILING CLUB SUCCESS\nFor the fifth year in succession the Sailing Club ha*\nwon the University Championship. This year, however, it obtained second place as well. The Chajepionahip was decided\nupon the beat five of seven races held during the winter\ntens*\nThe new boat Pajsnlua arrived after the first race bad\nbeen baud and so eo ul d only afford one Mistake. After a seo on d In the next race it was forced to retire in the third.\nProspects did not look too good, and the other three I.C. boats had fared no better* However, J. Conway-Jones, crowed\nin the main by H. Jackson, found his old form at last and won\nthe last four races. Seoond position was still very open\nwith several of the 20 boats placed favorably. T. Rodgars,\nera wed by C. Gent, brought the I.C. boat home.\nFENCING\nThe Fencing Club are in the pro o ess of recording their\nbest season for a long period. They have so far won 5 out\nof 7 * to he s fought, and also won the team prize in the U.L. Indivicjal Championships by a comfortable s arg in. The most eno our aging features of this season's results\nare the great iio j roves B nt of the e pee fencing, and the\nsolidarity of the sabre tes n.w hi oh is as yet unbeaten.\nIn the U.L. Tournament, I.C. was the only te<un to be\nrepresented in all three finals. Saddy won the a a bre title\nwith an unbeaten record, and Knill, the o apt a in, was second,\nhaving lost only to Heddy.\nRUGGER- SPARKES CUP\nR.C.S.6 Mines ?\nR.C.S., superior in the backs, scored a surprise win over\nthe Mines. Mines, playing with the wind, led 5 - 0 at half-time, but tries by Barnes and Shepherd, one of wh i oh was converted by Coates, won the day for R.C.S. The game was marred by a number of injuries, the worst\nbeing a broken ankle for J. Chester. We wish him a speedy\nrecovery.\nNext Wednesday R.C.S. meet Guilds - supporters would\nbe wa loom e.

It started when the\nminutes were questioned \u2014 am unheard of event in the lives of many present. Andy Levine, Guilds\npresident, opened business with the reading of a letter from the president of Heading University,\nwho wanted some coloured bulbs returned .\nUnfortunately, the bulbs, having attended the last\ntwo Carnivals, were in no condition to be returned\nand because or the financial instability of the\nHeading union a cash repayment, together, with\ntwenty-one coloured o and leB j for good measure, wer j to be presented to our poorer neighbours.\nThe seo on d item on the agenda was one of\nconsiderable importance as Keith Miller emphasise\nwhen he said that the measure he a dvo oat ed would\nnet to form the Guildsman of the future into a fully mature engineer in spite of the proposed\nincrease in numbers wh i oh might otherwise have\nprevented him taking part in Union activities. J a very large majority, the house passed the mot io i in favour of a Fresher's Dinner, in wh i oh each\n\"Freshman\" would have his own host for the even in j This host would pay all, or part of, the oost of'\nthe dinner.\nA plea for less course work and a proposed\ncriticism form on lecturers was loudly applauded\nThen followed a stormy and widely differing\ndiscussion on college hours, the original proposal\nbeing to lengthen the lu noh hour on every day of t lw dek. Mr.MaoKenzie expressed moot people's feel i js on saying \"Let us not tamper with the college hour*\nagainst the wishes of the majority.\" The basic i a a behind the proposal was to enable the smallest o lub s s to attract more members, but it was. felt that these\no lub s were in a definite minority.\nKeith Miller was on his feet again, this\ntime in indignation at the queue-jumping at tea-time\nin Queenies, and wishing to limit each person to one\ncup of tea. \"I was twenty-fourth in the queue one\nday,\" he said \"and I had the forty-eighth cup of tea J\" The house was amused, and before most people realised\nit, the motion that \"Any person who is obviously queue\njumping in the tea queue should have his trousers\nremoved and suspended from the flag-pole out Bide Guilds\"\nwas proposed, seconded and carried in a storm of cheers\nIvan Abbott leaped up and cried to the president \"We\nhave passed a dangerous motion.\" As otto vo ioe suggested he should see a. doctor.\nFinally, an n our after the meeting began, Mr.\nGraham proposed that Mr. Kenneth Horne should be e leo ted an honorary member of the Union to give Guilds the\n\"right sort of pub lio it y\". As soon as the president brought the meeting to\na close however, a crowd of jostling, laughing Guildsmen\nhurried to Queenies to de bag the first queue-jumper.\nWe wonder what the form is in the case of a her, not\na him l COMING EVENTS. i.ll ut.1 MAttCH lath.\n1.10p.m. in the Botany Leoiuee Theatre,\nI.C.S.

It may seem at first sight\nUnion is due to be demolished to all purposes for at least eighteen months\ntie point, if any, in criticising the\nhi oh will be taken away all too soon.\nThl3 is simply not true. For the first time in\nthe colleges' history, the average student has\nbeen able to speak his mind en masse on the subject of HIS dinner, - and on dinners in general.\nThe resulting flood of curses and compliments was\nsomething of a revelation.\nWe will present them to you in three sec-t ions: general grumbles, particular grumbles,\nand suggestions. Incidentally, there is a suggestions book kept in the Union, which receives\nregular attention at the hands of the Refeotory\nSub-Committee, for the use of the student and\nthe staff. There were no more than half a dozen\npeople who praised the existing arrangements.\nSeotlon 1) General Grumbles.\nAs one gentleman put it on his question-n aire, there are too many QQ QQ. QQ Q.A natural\nresult of this, is that an average student has to\nwait ou art er of an hour till he o an eat. When\nhe arrives at the head of the queue, he finds that\nthere are too few popular dishes, the food supply\nis irregular, and there is not enough of it. What is more, the presentation seems to upset his\naesthetic nature, and the food is lukewarm or cold\non receipt. One person suggests that the oost\nshould be compared to that at other colleges, such\nas Northampton Polytechnic Many believe the con\nditions of serving can be cleaner, especially in\nthe Snack Bar.\n(Editor's Note: Even though most of these complaints are valid to some degree or other, most\npeople fail to realize the tremendous diff io ul ties that the Refectory staffs have to fao e.) Section 2) Particular Grumbles\nL.D. H.UD. H. and Snack Bar.\nNo o of fee after lu noh; Soggy chips; Dirty\ntables (the remedy for this lies with the student),\nInadequate seating; staff smoking; etc. etc.\nAyrton Hall\nNo soup; Small portions; No variety; Burnt\nsausages; Stacks of dirty dishes; Stale rolls; etc. etc.\nSection 3) Suggestions.\nAfter reading through the previous section\nit is a welcome relief to read the more serious\nsuggestions. Some are pra ot i cable; some are not.\nWe hope the Refeotory Committee will consider them\nwith not too incensed feelings.\nMany people suggest that the methods adopted\nby J. Lyons and Co. could be studied with advantage\nThe use of two cash desks is considered to be a good idea during the rush hour, together with a \"Lay-by\" for those people who would prefer to wait\nuntil their oho ice has been presented. The old\nidea of staggering the Lunoh Hour appeared in various guises.\nAnother mu oh voiced opinion was the voluntary\nchoi oe of extras, such as potatoes, for wh i oha small additional charge oo ul d be made. But.\nabove all was the cry, \"Cut down the Queues!\"\nTo nono lude our little survey, a few of the\nmore amusing replies are printed below.\nAnon.\n- The Cashier is very nio e; pity the other dishes are not\nlike her.\n(Please note this dish is now off the menu; the lady in\nquestion has now left! Id.)\n,. P.G. Ioan not afford to buy alun oh with beer the pr ioe it is! One other interesting point came to light\nduring the survey. It seems that many post-grads, especially In R.C.S., as one put it, consider themselves above the \"a or amon p roles\". These gentlemen also appear to have lost the\nability to spell o or re otl y any word with more\nthan four syllables.\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nR.C.S The Bditor, 21-2-55.\nFelix.\nDear Sir,\nI think the Tinker, who last week suggested that Cassandra\nis suffering from a metallurgical misfit, was entirely misguided.\nIn fact, R.C.S. likes to help any of its ladies who are\nao obviously a ff lio ted. I therefore e ao lose a platform (w hio hI hope you will be able to forward to her) on wh i oh she o an further purify her soul to the amusement of the Tinsmiths.\nTours sincerely,\nG.A.3.( Ed. : enclosed with the letter was a tiny wooden soap box,\ninside which a block of 'Puritan' soap rested. Cassandra\nthanks G.A.S.) The Bditor,\nFelix.\nDear Sir,\nAocording to the last issue of Felix, hope of further\nhostel ac como dati on for I.C. ia now gone, as the U.G.C. does\nnot see its way to providing the neo esa ary \u00a31,000 per person\nfor a new hostel.\nSurely this is a very defeatist attitude. Provision for\nliving-in is ritual for any university worthy of the name and\nit is obvious on the most superficial examination that I.C. suffers from the relative lack of it. This situation we all\nknow will be made worse in the near future if something is not\ndone now.\nA new hostel would be rather beyond us, but surely two\nthousand students o an raise enough money to purchase on lease\none or two of the otherwise unused houses of the type in\nExhibition Rd. for use as further hostel ac como dati on. I do not suggest that dire ot contributions will be\nsufficient, but a little ingenuity and hard work will often\nmake a lot of money.\nLet us do something now before it is too late.\nR.L. Imperial College Hostel,\nS.W.7. Bear Sir,\nI hope this week you will find further opportunities\nto Fillmore spaces with his usual brilliant name.\nYours etc.,\nF,3.1m, I Fan\nOld Hostel,\n13,3,55\nThe Editor of Felix.\nDear Sir,\nSpurred on by the remarks in Nelson's Column I should\nlike to aom ment on your sports editions of the penultimate\nissue.\n\"Let us examine a few details of our inglorious reo or d\" call a spade a spade if you like but to describe our\nreo or d as inglorious is utter rubbish. One might think\nfrom the editorial that the main purpose of fielding team\nwas to amass cups. If your Sport's Editor really thinks\nthis, then he is wrong. It is well known that k nook out\no up oom petition a although exo it ing and nice to win are not\na really fair criterion on wh i oh to judge a team.\nOf the nineteen o lub s on A. C.O. brief exe r pts from the\nreo or ds of six were reviewed and the pros pe ots of two surmised and so the achievements and potentialities of more\nthan half the o lub s were not even o on3ide red.

A number of\no lub so an field the strongest team in the University and at\nleast two are stronger than U.L.f hen the accounts are audited at the end of the year,\n1954-55 will hardly appear ao one of the leaner sporting\nyears.\nAlastair Fairbairn.\n^ \u201e ^ A n?t*er letter on same au bj eot has been\nreo eiv ed from w.

Soott\nRussell who studied Botany at I.C. was the second In\ncommand of the expedition.\nThe toast to the guests was given by M.R.

Peter Leads was\nchosen by the I.C. Executive to represent our college among\nthe group of foreign students Invited by the Stalents'\nUnion. He recorded these impressions of of the e, \u00a3\ngh t days\nhe spent in the German capital.\n\"Since the blockade of 1948, life in West Berlin has\nshown a steady improvement for ita citizens. Although many\ngaps are still to be seen in the streets, new blocks of flats\nof floes, and roads have been built and the soars of war are\ndisappearing steadily. The shops are well filled and people\napparently have the money to buy.\nThe German students took us to the Berlin Kind! Brewery\nand to the Ernst Renter power station which was partly re-equipped during the blockade. They did not neglect the social\nside, however, and took us to the Opera, the Theatre and\nintroduced us to some of the Night-Clubs. These night i clubs are very cheap by London standards and the price of a beer\nenables one to see the floor show and dan oe with the young\ngirls provided.\n\"On pre-war weekends the Berllne**would visit the many\nlakes and woods surrounding the city for his pleasures. Now\nhe cannot travel more than seven miles from the centre of\nthe West Sector and so he makes his amusements in hie own\nneighbourhood. The West Sector fortunately includes one large\nlake and a forest, and in Sumner these are very popular.\n\"We visited the Russian Sector and here one sees a very\ndifferent picture. In the centre, at least, rebuilding is\nvirtually confined to a new Russian Embassy and a long street\ncalled the Stalin Allee, which is filled with large white\nbuildings in the Moscow style. Thereis very little t raff io and advertisements are confined to Political exhortations. As\nthe tube train pas see into the East Sector, Western newspapers\ndisappear\u2014 possession of one may bring a term of imprisonment.\nOn leaving the last East Sector tube station, sn announcer\nsays, \"You are now leaving the da aoc ratio sector.\" Just to\nprove this, papers from the undemocratic West reappear.\n\"Despite many difficulties, the West Berlin students have\na full college life, and they proved to be charming and\ngro ero di boats.\"\nREFECTORY COMMITTEE MEETING\nAt the Refectory Sub Committee meeting on Monday, the\nmain item under discussion was the provision of new ac como dati on for the lunch hour.

SOUThGAIfi Circulation : 1200\nOn Thursday last, City and Guilds College adopted a proposal\nwhich may have far-reaching effects on future Guildsmen - the\nidea of a Fresher's Dinner with undergraduate hosts. The idea,\nis not a new one, for many years ago Guilds held such a dinner,\nand Mines still do. However new or not the proposal shows great\nforesight.\nWe all know that the three colleges of I.C. are due to expand in numbers in the next few years,but not many of us have\ninterested ourselves in what will happen to the future Corporate life of our respective Unions. We pride ourselves in our\nsocial life; but there is grave danger looming ahead which\nforebodes evil on this life- threatening to turn I.C. into yet\nanother polytechnic institute.\nUnless we,the present students, make the effort to interest\nthe Freshman in this society or that club, and to meet his fellows\nout of work time, tills danger cannot be averted. The Fresher's Dinner is the answer that Mines have found successful, and\nthat Guilds have adopted. Let us hope the scientists\nfollow suit.because unless something is done, there are\ngoing to bo more Brown Baggers in I.C. than exist im the\nwhole of H.L. DRAM. Soc. pRoDUCTION. The Dramatic Society* s offerings thi3 term were\nChekhov's comedy, \"The Proposal\", and Jean Anouilh's Modern version of \"Antigone\".\n\"The Proposal\", although hardly .typical Chekhov,\nserved as a light hors d'o eu vre to the more serious fare.\nDue to some very good acting, none of the humour was lost\n- indeed, it wa3 added to by Martin Jacobs' gymnastics.\nIt was felt, however, that he and Rosemary Melville would\nstill be at loggerheads had not Dick Saunders managed to\nget the proposal carried without a division.\nIan Duff s production (in three weeks!) of''Antigone w was far above the general run of College drama tio s, and he\nis to be congratulated on this polished performance. He\nalso had no mean role as chor U3, and o a me through with\nflying colours.\nLea Allen excelled in a long and difficult portrayal\nof Creon- a very different part from others he has previously taken. The play was really made by magnificent\ncut and thrust dialogue between him and Judith Korhbluth,\nwhose Antigone was superb, to say the least.\nOf the supporting characters, Rosemary Melville was\nvery good a3 Antigone's nurse, and although Haemon (Michael\nSpence) seemed a trifle uncertain when facing the girl-friend, he was very impressive when wrangling with his\nfather, Creon^\nLight relief was afforded by Derek Hill's cockney\n\"First Guard\". The other two Guards had smaller parts -John Hendy's northern brogue was quite pleasing, but Dan\nBoyle's a coen t seemed rather out of pla oe. Kathy Dent as Surydice had very little to do except\nknit, and it was quite a relief when Tony Eycott eventually\nopened his mouth.\nThe set and back o loth were very effective, and the\nlighting was excellent. It is a pity that the audie no e was no reflection on the merits of the play, which deserved\nbetter.\nWe hear that the denizens of the Senior\nCommon Room are investing in a painting.\nFinding that they had some \u00a375 to spend,\ntheir committee selected a work, on show\nin a gallery in town, and staff members\nhave been going along to examine it. Such an investment is a good one,and\nperhaps the example might be followed by\nour Union. Apparently one provincial\nuniversity some years ago began investing in one\ngood painting a year and now have a valuable\ncollection. Its worth is in or easing as the years.\n\u2022J. We are sorry to hear that \"Charlie\" Chester, the man\n\u2022 we profiled in our last issue, is on oe again in bed,\nafter breaking his ankle in the Mines v. R.C.S. Cup\ngame. last time you will remember it was 'flu.\n\u2022 Mr. Hewby, well known for his work as Vacation Work\nOffioer, has moved to 178, Queens Gate. Most of the\nI.C. Administration staff are now at 178 or 179 in\nSJueens Gate, in accordance with the expansion 3chem a. a*. Two King's College students had the nerve to come up\nto I.C, last week, in reply to the reply to an advertisement in the U.L. Rag. They thought that they would\nmeet two Icwarians. As they described themselves as\nmy so gy nist s, the men of I.C. decided that they should\nleave as such, so th sy were driven away to South Kan.\ntube station in a Builders handcart, dressed in slips\ninstead of trousers.\n\u2022y w Insertion: Stop Press News: - Does anybody want a Chess\n9\nreport? The FELIX Sports Editor is at the moment complaining bitterly that he's not having it on his page\n- s s ye \"That's not a sport J\" Nelson is not having\nit either.\nHELP FELIX1\n\u2022 \u2022 If you are a writer, artist, critic, typist,\nphotographer, interested inches o, or just\nwilling to do what you can to help, drop a note\nto the Bailor in the Union letter rack. The hours\ndo not exceed a morning or an afternoon every other\nSunday. The time Is well spent, in good company,\n(including the FELIX athlete in his usual brilliant waistcoat). Just drop a note in the rack, that's all-.\nMartin Jacob and a sub-committee of four are at\npresent working on the Guilds' contribution to the\nLord Mayor's Show. They have to work out a suitable\ntheme and the cost of the contribution.\nj tm On Tuesday the 8th, a packed House defeated a \u2022\u2022motion that everybody had thought would carry:\n\"That in the Opinion of this House, University\nEducation should be to provide a Technique of\nLiving, not a Technique of Barnlng.\" Two guest\nspeakers from Bedford supported the debate,\nwhich produced several good speeches from the\nfloor. The notion was lost 7 2 - 3 9 , with 25\nabstentions. So now we know why I.C.11 fe is so\ndull.\nJ.
