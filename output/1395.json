If in a dark window\nyou see an even darker silhouette staring back, or if the branches of a tree suddenly shiver like a spider\u2019s\nweb that\u2019s caught something, or if you follow a stranger into a graveyard (or a pub where everything\nisn\u2019t as it seems)...you could well be wayfaring to the rebecks of eternity.

This\nmusuem shows a cross-section of extraordinary objects from his collection,\nranging from diagnostic dolls to Japanese sex aids, and from Napoleon\u2019s\ntoothbrush to shrunken heads and chastity belts (shown in photo). It also\nprovides a very different perspective on medicine and health!\nJack the Ripper Tour\nTower Hill Station\nJack the Ripper came silently out of the midnight shadows of August 31, 1888, butchering East End\nprostitutes, leaving a trail of blood and gore that led... nowhere. Inspect the murder sites, sift through\nthe evidence - in all its gory detail - and get to grips with the main suspects. This tour, led by London\nWalks, is one of the best out there.

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n10 felix Friday 8 February 2008\nPolitics\nPolitics Editors \u2013 Li-Teck Lau and Kadhim Shubber\nThe results of Super Tuesday!\nLast Tuesday voters in 24 states went to the ballot box to vote in Democratic and Republican primaries\nDry Wit & Tonic\nStarting at top left \u2013 John McCain, Mitt Romney, and Mike Huckabee From left \u2013 Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama\nPresidential election Primaries\nand Caucuses are basically two\ndifferent methods of accomplishing the same thing. They\nare, simply, a way in which\neach political party (Democrat-ic and Republican) lets voters\naround the U.S. choose their\nparty\u2019s presidential candidate.\nMore technically, presidential\nprimaries and caucuses are the\nway that delegates or representatives from each state, are\nselected to go to the party\u2019s\nnational convention.\nThe party\u2019s national convention is usually held the summer before the presidential\nelection. Each party chooses a\npresidential nominee based on\nhow representatives from each\nstate vote at the convention.\nBoth parties select their delegates based on the primary or\ncaucuses vote in each particular state \u2013 the delegates represent the views of the voters in\nthe state.\nAt the Republican party con-vention, a winner takes all system is used. The candidate with\nthe most votes in a states caucus or primary wins all the delegates that the state sends to\nthe national convention. However at the democratic conven-tion, a different system is used.\nThe number of delegates each\ncandidate receives is proportional to the number of votes\nreceived in each state primary\nor caucus. The number of delegates that each state can send\nto the national convention is\ndetermined by party rules. the\nstate\u2019s population, number of\nelected officials in office and\npast support of party candidates is considered to decide\nthe number of delegates.\nHow does it\nall work?\nA\nfter Super Tuesday, John\nMcCain has cemented\nhis position as front-run-ner for the Republican\nnomination. However\nthe race is not over, with Mike Huckabee\u2019s surprise performance turning it\ninto a 3-horse contest.\nJohn McCain won the big states,\nNew York and California, as well as 7\nother states giving him a total win of\n511 delegates. His performance positions him as the front-runner but certainly has not ended the race. There\nwere mixed feelings at the McCain\ncamp after the victory. While he told\nthe crowd \u201cTonight, I think we must\nget used to the idea, that we are the\nRepublican Party front-runner\u201d, he was\nalso cautious, speaking in terms of a\n\u201clong way ahead\u201d. Mr McCain has good\nreason to be cautious, he is still treated\nwith suspicion by Republican conservatives who believe him to be soft on the\nDemocrats and somewhat of a maver-ick. Super Tuesday has shown us that\nRepublican conservatives are still not\nwilling to embrace McCain, preferring\nRomney and Huckabee.\nMitt Romney certainly had a bad\nnight on Tuesday. He is significantly\nbehind John McCain in terms of dele-gates. He won 7 states but only accrued\n176 delegates as a result. The McCain\ncampaign team has certainly tried to\nportray Romney as out of the race, by\nreleasing a memo penned by McCain\nstrategist Charlie Black. \u201cWith Mike\nHuckabee still a factor in this race,\nparticularly in the South, and many\ncontests moving forward proportional,\nthe math is nearly impossible for Mitt\nRomney to win the nomination,\u201d he\nwrote.\nMike Huckabee is a thorn in the side\nfor the Romney campaign. By directly\ncompeting with Romney for conservative support, Huckabee has split the\nRepublican conservative vote and given McCain an opportunity to extend\nhis lead. it is becoming very likely that\nHuckabee is staying in the race, precisely to prevent Romney from winning\nthe race. While Huckabee and McCain\ndo not agree on all of their policy, they\ndo share a dislike of Mitt Romney\nT\nhe race to secure the\ndemocratic nomination\nremains neck and neck\nafter a largely inconclusive Super Tuesday for\nHillary Clinton and Barack Obama.\nTheir wins are largely balanced and it\ndoesn\u2019t seem too unbelievable to suggest that the nomination might still be\ncontested at the Democratic National\nConvention.\nHillary Clinton won 8 states, 5 less\nthan Barack Obama. However included\nin these states were the big prizes such\nas California and New York. Therefore the number of delegates that she\nwon was 582, 20 more than Obama.\nThe Clinton Camp was extremely optimistic after Tuesday\u2019s result. Clinton\ncampaign spokesman Doug Hattaway\nhad this to say, \u201cThe voters defied the\npundits\u2019 expectations again, we\u2019re excited about beating the perceived momentum that Obama had,\u201d With Clinton still garnering support from female\nvoters she certainly has cause for cel-ebration. The night did throw up some\ncause for concern, the Clinton camp\nwas focused on winning the big states,\nignoring the many smaller states that\nwent to Obama. In addition, Obama\ndid welll even in the states he lost, and\nin the democratic system where every\nvote counts this could prove to be important as the campaign continues.\nThe Obama campaign had a mixed\nnight. While there is certainly no\ngrounds to suggest that he isn\u2019t a serious contender, there is the feeling that\nObama\u2019s supporters were hoping for a\nknockout blow that would push them\nfirmly into the lead. Instead the \u2018campaign for change\u2019 has really bought\nmore time in a race that seems to favour\nHillary the longer it goes on. There is\nsome concern that despite the momentum Senator Obama had built up in the\nprevious week, he was unable to turn it\ninto a decisive victory. However this is\nunlikely to dampen optimism amongst\nObama\u2019s campaigners and with reports\nthat he raised more than $1m a day in\none recent month Barack Obama is\ndefinitely still in the race, and there is\nno indication that a clear winner is going to appear any time soon.\n\n"

However the GSA Secretary post remains unfilled after both\ncandidates withdrew midway through\nthe election.\nThe GSA represents postgraduates\nat Imperial including PhD and Masters\nstudents, by voicing their concerns\nand needs to the Union, the College\nand nationally. However, the association has been non-existant since November when the previous Chair, Jon\nMatthews, resigned in dramatic fashion after Union Council rejected two\nof his reports deeming his work over\nthe summer break unsatisfactory. His\nresignation left the GSA committee\nwithout any members. Postgraduate\nrepresentation suffered further still last\nterm without a permanent Postgraduate Co-ordinator staff member present\nwithin the Union.\nMr Frensch was the sole nominee in\nthe race for GSA Chair beating RON\n(re-open nominations) 111 votes to\n19. The contest for Treasurer was very\nclosely contested, however, with four\nvotes separating Ms Bisiriyu and her\nclosest rival.\nTurnout has increased slightly since\nthe last election, going from 111 to 130\nvotes in the GSA Chair election compared to the last election. 211 votes\nwere cast in the Treasurer election\nbut with over 4,500 postgraduates at\nImperial College the overall turnout\nremains very poor with less than 5% of\nthe electorate voting.\nHopefully, if Mr Frensch\u2019s ambitious\nmanifesto is anything to go by, the\nGSA will bring some tangible change\nfor postgraduate students. In it, he says\nhe wants to \u201cgain \u2018student status\u2019 for\nwriting-up students\u201d in order to waive\ncouncil tax and to allow them to use\nCollege\u2019s facilities, since PhD students\nin their fourth year lose swipe card ac-cess. He also states that he will campaign to \u201callow research students to\nkeep income from scholarships that exceed standard paying rate\u201d and to \u201cregain pay taken from Mathematics PhD\nstudents when they were underpaid.\u201d\nUnlike his predecessor, Mr Frensch\nwill have a Treasurer for support and\nwith the recent appointment of a permanent Union Postgraduate Co-ordinator the GSA appears to be getting\nback on track. The Union President,\nStephen Brown, told Felix that now\nthe GSA has a core team from which\nit can build on, it will be left to its own\ndevices and to find itself a Secretary to\ncomplete the GSA trinity.\nIf Mr Frensch achieves everything\nhe set out to do, he will be one of the\ngreatest student representatives ever.\nEven if he brings only his first promise\nto fruition he will have resuscitated the\nGSA, which has been flat-lining for a\nwhile.

A female passenger in the MercedesBenz was taken to hospital as a result of the accident, however\nno one else was injured.

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\nFriday 8 February 2008 felix\nPolitics\nDespite the UK being one of the most\ncapitalistic countries in the world, it\nhas never been particularly anti-tax.\nThat\u2019s not to say people enjoy paying\ntaxes or wouldn\u2019t mind their own particular burden being reduced \u2013 they\nare human, after all. Instead, there\nsimply isn\u2019t a particularly strong belief\nthat taxes should be low and there is\nremarkably little protest at the government raising taxes openly, introducing\nnew ones or using stealth measures to\nincrease taxes. The British people appear to have made their peace with tax\nin a way that Americans (rightly, in this\nwriter\u2019s opinion) never will.\nThere is one type of tax, however,\nfor which this rule is blown out of the\nwater. Despite being a tax that affects\na remarkably small proportion of the\npopulation in any significant way there\nis surely no tax that is more despised\nthroughout the country than that on\nestates worth over \u00a3600,000 ($1.2m).\nDoing my research for this article, it\nwas difficult to find a source (bar the\ngovernment) that would discuss this issue without making a shamelessly political point on why inheritance tax is\nso awful. Those who argue against the\ntax are incensed by its role as a \u201cdouble\ntax\u201d: they claim that the benefactor is\ntaxed once upon earning the money\nand then again on death. This is being\nrather pedantic. The sufferer of the tax\nin the second instance is the heir, not\nthe person who has died. Labour MP\nStephen Byers argued that inheritance\ntax is \u201ca penalty on hard work, thrift,\nand enterprise\u201d. I fail to see how this is\nthe case for inheritance tax but not for\nincome tax, capital gains tax, and every\nsingle other type of tax that has ever\nexisted. I will not make the point that\ninheritance tax is a good thing; on the\ncontrary, I consider anything that forces a person to part with their property\n(e.g., tax, robbery) to be a necessary\nevil at best and just plain evil at worst.\nMy point, rather, is to take a step back\nand consider this tax relative to other\ntaxes. My point \u2026 is that inheritance\ntax is probably the least offensive of all\ntypes of tax.\nFirst, let us put on our practical economist hat. One of the reasons capitalists believe in low taxes is that tax discourages innovation, hard work, and\ninvestment. It is self-evident that the\ngreater the financial reward that people will get for their work, the harder\nthey will work. The hard work-low tax\nrelationship applies for virtually every\ntype of tax \u2026 except inheritance tax.\nInheritance tax does very little damage to the country\u2019s economy relative\nto all other types of taxes. Worse still, a\nlack of inheritance tax potentially has a\nnegative effect on the economy \u2013 why\nwork and contribute to society when\none can live off one\u2019s inherited estate?\nIt is strange, but there seems to be little\nreason to attack this tax in the name of\nfiscal efficiency.\nThinking more ideologically and less\npractically, let us consider \u201cfairness\u201d,\nindeed an important factor when considering the need to force people to\npart with their property. Again, I must\nstress that all tax falls into the same\nbucket on this. Private property is an\ninalienable right and all that. But there\nmust be measure. It is, surely, more\ninappropriate to force a person to\npart with property personally earned\nthrough hard work than property\n\u201cearned\u201d by mere virtue of birth. I suppose this argument does not extend to\nlifetime gifts as I do not consider these\ndifferent from a salary. It is, rather,\nbased on the fact that inheritance represents a person trying to influence\nevents on Earth that occur after their\ndeath. Something about exercising\none\u2019s rights after one\u2019s demise is simply\na bit more woolly than exercising those\nsame rights while still alive \u2013 we all\nbelieve in the lifetime right to vote but\nwhat if someone decided to bequeath\na vote to their favourite political party\nfor an election held after their death?\nIs this really all that different?\nLastly, I shall espouse an argument\nthat I would not myself ever pay heed\nto, on the basis that it is selfish, but is\none that many might find influences\ntheir feelings on the matter. Quite\nfrankly, unless your parents are particularly wealthy and you plan on remaining in a relatively low-paying job,\nyou have much more to personally gain\nfrom cuts in income and capital gains\ntax than you do from inheritance tax.\nAs alluded to earlier, a mere 6% of British households pay a penny of inheritance tax and the majority of these\npay a small amount. The average bill\nlast year was \u00a3100,000 and the median\nis undoubtedly lower. This may seem\nlike a lot of money but it really isn\u2019t\nfor the wealthiest 6% of Britons when\ncompared to their personal lifetime in-come, especially for having done nothing whatsoever (and having received\n\u00a3850,000 in the average case). The only\npeople who are really significantly affected by this tax are the tiny number\nwho have windfalls of over \u00a35 million\ncoming to them (and if one is really\nworth that much, then one is a fool if\nthere isn\u2019t a clever Mayfair tax lawyer\nensuring that tax bill never comes).\nI cannot in good conscience promote\ninheritance tax as a good thing but I\nwill stand by my view of it as a best-of-all-evils tax. This transcends party pol-itics; the left seem to love taxes anyway\nand the right should concern themselves about taxes that hit the hardworking than those that hit the merely\nfortunate. I don\u2019t expect many to agree\nwith me, but I suppose I never do.\nLife: just death and taxes\nAbioye Oyetunji\nYes, they\u2019re US Dollars, but you try find a high resolution photo of the good old Pound Sterling\nNews from all over the known world\nIn case you couldn\u2019t stomach reading\nmore than a string of 50 words on poli-tics, here are some stories from across\nthe known world.\nChad under attack\nChad\u2019s capital N\u2019Djamena was stormed\nlast Saturday in an unsuccessful attempt by rebels from the east of the\ncentral African country to oust President Idriss Deby. The event sparked\nan escalation in insurgent activity\nwhich the government of Chad claims\nhave been aided by its troubled neigh-bour, Sudan. French President Nicolas\nSarkozy reasserted his support for Deby\u2019s government and pledged to assist\nmilitarily in the former colony should\nit be further threatened.\nEavesdropping\nJack Straw, the UK\u2019s Justice Minister,\ncame to the defence of fellow Labour\nMP Sadiq Khan whose conversations\nwith a terrorist suspect in prison were\nsaid to have been recorded, stating that\nsuch news was an attempt to smear Mr.\nKhan. Recording or bugging members\nof Parliament is in contravention of the\nso-called \u2018Wilson Doctrine\u2019.\nItalian turmoil\nItaly is facing more political troubles\nafter President Giorgio Napolitano\ndissolved the country\u2019s Parliament last\nweek, sparking an election within 70\ndays by constitutional decree. It follows the loss of a vote of confidence\non Prime Minister Romano Prodi in\nJanuary, who subsequently submitted\nhis resignation. Problems began nearly\na year ago when Prodi\u2019s government\nfailed to gain support in Parliament\nfor the funding of Italian troops in\nAfghanistan.\nNew Year snow storms\nCommuters all over China battled\nagainst severe weather as many millions made their way home over the\nlast week for the New Year celebrations through some of the worst snow\nstorms the country has seen in recent\ntimes. The year of the Rat was welcomed in on Thursday on a calendar\nbased on lunar observations. President\nHu Jin Tao made visits to some of the\nworst-hit regions. Some four million\nresidents in Chenzhou, a city in Hunan\nprovince, spent the celebrations without electricity, as electricians and the\nmilitary worked extra hours in an attempt to restore essential utilities shut\ndown by the winter storms.\nLi-Teck Lau\nFresh,\ndelicious\nscandal\nI\n\u2019m almost droolling, delicious\nscandal, intrigue and misinformation \u2026 Sorry, I\u2019m just thinking about Tuesday\u2019s Political\nPhilosophy Society\u2019s Israel/Palestine discussion.\nDue to Dr. Azzam Tamimi being\nuninvited, there were whispers of pro-tests. Luckily Islamists did not protest\noutside the Sherfield building, but still\nit was pretty tense. I began to suspect\nthe bearded people sitting around me\n\u2026 maybe they were going to start waving placards about free speech \u2013 hold\non, Muslims supporting free speech,\nyes, reader, I too was confused.\nProceedings began with an explanation of this whole uninviting somebody\nbusiness. Basically \u201cspeaker replaced\n\u2026 blah blah \u2026 irresolvable differences\nblah blah\u201d. All very boring until I heard\nthe Jerusalem Post being accused of\npoor journalism. Hey, it was suddenly\ngetting interesting!\nUnfortunately, the talk itself was\ntame. More scandal did however arise:\nGhada Karmi read a statement condemning the treatment of Dr. Azzam\nTamimi. She said that it was \u201cunacceptable to treat a good scholar in this\nway\u201d and that if she had known the\ntruth surrounding the uninvitation she\n\u201cwould have withdrawn from the talk\u201d.\nI still had no idea what this \u2018truth\u2019 was\nFinally, when the Q&A began, I got\nsome GODDAMN ANSWERS! A\ncrazy man in the audience accused\nthe PPS of deceiving Imperial students\nand said they should clarify just what\nthe fuck is going on. He then directed a\nquestion at guest speaker David Newman: \u201cIs there any Israeli who is man\nenough to share a platform with Tamimi?\u201d It was beginning to sound like a\npre-fight press conference. Mr. Newman explained everything, and I got\nthe feeling the PPS didn\u2019t quite want\nhim to explain. He told us that HE in\nfact withdrew from the talk, when he\nfound out who Dr. Azzam Tamimi\nwas. Essentially David Newman did\nnot want to share a platform with a\nman who has said he was prepared to\nbe a suicide bomber. He then told us\nthat he did not ask for Tamimi to be\nremoved, just that he wouldn\u2019t be attending if Dr. Tamimi did. Good job of\nlaying the controversy right at the feet\nof the PPS.\nWhat the Jerusalem Post did to incur the wrath of Imperial\u2019s PPS was\npublish an article stating that David\nNewman had withdrawn. The PPS was\ntrying to keep the whole affair about\nwhich speaker to choose under wraps\nand the Jerusalem Post ruined all that\nby writing about it. While uninviting\nDr. Tamimi was not an attack on free\nspeech it would seem that the PPS\ndoesn\u2019t appreciate the free press. If you\nwere hoping for a shifty finances or\ninternal tensions scandal, don\u2019t worry\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be plenty of all that\nfrom the Union.

    "content": "Culture &\nThe Arts\nArts Editors \u2013 Rosie Grayburn, Caz Knight, David Paw and Emily Wilson\nBudding culture vulture? Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n17\nFriday 8 February 2008 felix\nCaz Knight\nArts Editor\nThe Arab and the Jew \u2013 a\ntopical masterpiece it seems\nCaz Knight goes in search of artistic inspiration and comes out questioning modern\nday politics. The Arab and the Jew is a must-see at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith\nT\nhe Arab and the Jew: I was\nsteeling myself for a very\nmeaningful, political play,\nheaving with messages\nand historical references.\nOn closer inspection, the promise of\n\u201ca riot of sound, image and movement\u201d\npromised an evening of more experimental theatre, but leaden with a political agenda nonetheless.\nAnd so I went along to the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, with the Arab Soc\nto see this riot. For those of you unfamiliar with the Arab Soc, it seeks to\namalgamate the myriad of cultures and\ntraditions present and thriving within\nthe vast Arab-speaking world, and to\nshare and experience these among\nImperial students. Spanning over 23\ncountries, one can imagine the diversity of what the community has to offer.\nFrom the moment that an Arab and a\nJew come falling from the sky, landing\nin what seems to be the desert (actually\na very convincing and inviting looking\nsandbox), the play is a trip down the\nrabbit hole in terms of logic and imagi-nation. The logician within me tried to\nassign some storyline to the play as it\nprogressed, and failed. Just when you\nthink you may have deciphered one of\nthe many mad scenes in the perform-ance, off it hurtles once more on a\ntangent you would never have thought\npossible.\nThe title Arab and Jew are Allel\nNedjari and Amit Lahav, which make\nup Gecko. The Arab and the Jew\nsets about to celebrate their brotherhood and laugh and cry at their own\nreflections.\nBut on what? Those who care not\nfor current affairs, history or common sense might not be aware that in\n1948 an arbitrary border was created,\ndividing Palestine in half thus creating\nthe state of Israel. This was following\na huge surge in Jewish Immigration to\nPalestine on account of the National\nSocialism threatening Germany. Needless to say, the people of Palestine \u2013 the\nArabs \u2013 did not take too kindly to this,\nand it remains a source of conflict.\nThis really is experimental theatre at\nits best. However, I am reluctant to call\nit that, as \u201cexperimental\u201d may suggest\ninsubstantial and slightly pointless:\nbeing different for difference\u2019s sake,\nthough thoroughly enjoyable and effective it may be. The Arab and the Jew\nhas substance and it is in no way point-less. It offers so much originality, not\nonly in subject matter but in presentation as well.\nNedjari and Lahav compliment each\nother perfectly and the whole play runs\nseamlessly as a result. Their synchronicity and co-ordination with props,\nsound and each other makes for a stunning performance.\nThe use of such a small stage was\nimpressive and the atmosphere created beautifully with the help of lighting and music, both Arabic and Jewish.\nOne highlight was the slapstick-in-spired \u201ccomedy show\u201d which adds a\nwhole lot of humour without adding\ntackiness or detracting in the slightest\nfrom either the talent of the two actors\nor the theme of the play. Which is still\nan ambiguous matter!\nMy total confusion throughout must\nbe down to my miniscule knowledge\nand understanding of this political sit-uation, or so I thought. However, upon\nleaving the play slightly dumbfounded,\nI came to realise this was the general\nfeeling of the audience as a whole. I had\nat least grasped, and was proud of the\nfact, that the men\u2019s quarrel over an orange was symbolic of the quarrel over\nthe land! Another possible explanation\nfor the dusty and disheveled doll is the\nfact that children are often forgotten\nduring such conflicts.\nRegardless of how much you know\nabout politics or history, this play is a\njoy to watch and provides both hilarity\nand thought provoking entertainment.\nThe Arab and the Jew is on until\n9th February at the Studio, Lyric\nTheatre, Hammersmith. Tickets\ncan be booked from www.lyric.\nco.uk.\nNow that is what you call waiter service. Impressive moves at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith\nW\nelcome to Lent! I do\nhope more of you\ngot to gorge yourselves on delicious\npancakes on Tuesday, unlike me who has not had that\npleasure since before I was sent away\nto boarding school. I do not count the\ncold, rubbery offerings doused in artificial lemon juice from the St Mary\u2019s\nkitchen as my Shrove Tuesday treat.\nNot that I deserved a final indulgence\nbefore the forty days that lay ahead of\nsupposed fasting. I was never too good\nat fulfilling my Lenten promise to abstain from my vices. It all seems rather\nfutile to have one \u201clast\u201d mad day of\nfrenzied hedonism when we know that\nLent will be anything for us but chaste.\nHowever, I am never one to turn down\nan excuse to party so bring it on I say! If\nI were writing this in Rio I would most\ndefinitely be nursing a severe hangover\non account of the magnificent Carnaval that had just taken place over four\ndays, from last Saturday and ending on\nMardi Gras (\u201cFat Tuesday\u201d). As one\ncan imagine, given the vast cultural\ndiversity of Brazil, the Brazilians\u2019 lust\nfor all things fun mixed with tropical\nweather and a stunning landscape set-ting, that would make for one exotic\nfiesta. Simply by typing \u201cRio carnival\u201d\ninto Google images (or perhaps Yahoo)\none can begin to appreciate the techni-clour madness that has just ensued on\nthe streets of Rio.\nA European equivalent is the German Carneval where the hard working nation is granted a period off from\ntheir Flei\u03b2 (hard work) and woman\nhave to right to cut in half the tie of\nany man who crosses their path. Count\nourselves lucky us Brits do not have an\nequivalent tradition: it would only have\nbeen abolished by now on account of\n\u201cHealth and Safety\u201d laws. (Bastards).\nLent seems to come just a tad on the\nlate side to be an antidote to our Yuletide pleasures. Had Jesus gone into the\ndesert and died a few months earlier,\nthen we might have found ourselves\nmore motivated to start that diet or\nstick to those resolutions due to the\ncoming of Lent. January might not\nseems so dismal if we had a scapegoat\nfor our forced miserly penny pinching\nthat follows the Christmas excesses.\nJanuary may even be an unofficial Lent:\nwe are coerced into sobriety by situation rather than by religion. Enough\ntalk of that ghastly month. Here at Arts\nFelix we are paying no heed to Lent as\nwe seek to delight and indulge you in\nlots of arty goodness.\nAnd so, we give you The Arab and\nthe Jew review! Our poem comes\nfrom a woman who certainly does not\nagree with fasting and challenges the\nroles that society sometimes forces us\nto play. The surrealist nature of Der\nNachst Zug definitely echoes some\nof the themes in my article on the influence drugs can have on art. And\nlastly, our Student Art in Focus ties in\nnicely with the theme of chemicals and\npsychedelia. Rather an adulterated issue of Felix Arts to start our period of\n\u201cfasting\u201d wouldn\u2019t you say? Allel Nedjari and Amit Lahav partake in some light gymnastics\n\n"

    "content": "Coming together at the seams: Knit Sock forms\nImperial\u2019s newest society, cleverly dubbed Knit Sock, introduces itself and exposes the closet knitters\nE\nveryone\u2019s doing it. No, it\u2019s\ndefinitely not illicit sex,\ndrugs and rock n\u2019 roll, or the\nlatest political uprising (we\nare at Imperial, after all), it\nis, however, knitting. Regulars of the\nUnion bar had to double-take before\nordering their next drink on Monday at 5, when the bar was invaded by\nImperial\u2019s newest society, Knit Sock\n(clever pun intended.) They couldn\u2019t\nbelieve their eyes when the society\u2019s\nopening event saw the union swamped\nby beginners, enthusiasts, and those\nwho were just plain curious about the\nwhole thing: not to mention the most\nshocking of all - an even gender ratio.\nIndeed, after refuelling at the bar, many\ncame over to see what all the fuss was\nabout and some even put down their\nbeers, picked up a pair of needles and\nhad a go themselves.\nAs the name suggests, Knit Sock provides encouragement and training to\neager beginners as well as an arena for\nknitting afficionados to share and improve their talents. There is a common\nmisconception amongst young people\nthat knitting is the hobby of elderly\nwomen who have nothing better to do\nthan sit at home, stockpiling scarves,\nhats and gloves for an unknown impending ice age.\nAlthough knitting is a solo endeav-our, it is an extremely social activity\nthat can be done by anyone. Celebrities including Cameron Diaz, Kate\nMoss, Madonna, Daryl Hannah and\nRussell Crowe have been seen enjoying the hobby and even our very own\ncelebrity Stephen Brown stopped in to\ngive it a go. They have helped bring the\nrevival of knitting back into the public\neye, giving closet knitters the encouragement to shout it aloud and be proud\nof this truly awesome skill.\nBut why now? The last time it was\nat its height was during WWII when\nit was your duty to make all of your\nfamily\u2019s clothes (oh yes, there is such\na thing as knitted underwear). These\ndays, though, it\u2019s partly due to the huge\nselection of yarns - including ones that\nchange colour so you don\u2019t have to,\nand, to take it further, self-patterning\nyarn, as well as renowned magazines\nlike Vogue revitalizing their patterns.\nFurthermore, knitting can be performed almost anywhere at any time:\nso you should always carry a pair of\nknitting needles, a ball of yarn and a\nbasic grasp of the craft around with\nyou. Ever felt like your life was being\nwasted on those commutes in, gazing\nat someone else\u2019s shoes? Think about\nhow your productivity would skyrocket if you were whipping up some\nmittens or a jumper instead.\nThe very thought of knitting has\nbrought smiles and laughter to many\nImperial students and academics,\nmany of whom thought it was an\namusing suggestion but one that had\nno place in this prestigious university.\nAfter some asking around in the JCR\nand within different departments,\nhowever, we were able to unearth some\nof those closet knitters, and even more\nwho were eager to learn, who were\nvery interested in joining a club where\nthey could enjoy this pastime. Exasperated with none of the pre-existing\n250+ clubs and societies at Imperial\nmeeting these needs, a few knitting\ndevotees decided it was about time a\nsociety dedicated to craftwork (includ-ing crochet, embroidery and cross\nstitch) was started. Hence Knit Sock\nwas conceived and is being nurtured\ninto Imperial life, armed with a box\nfull of knitting needles and a bag full\nof yarn, and last week the mother lode\nof home-made chocolate chip cookies.\nThe huge interest in this society prior\nto its official opening was surpassed\nby even more students joining and becoming members on Monday evening.\nAnd why shouldn\u2019t it be popular?\nTo tell you the truth, knitting is a lot\nlike the practicals that we all churn\nout, but a lot more fun, not least because there is a pint involved. You have\nyour materials, your needles and wool\nequivalent to any apparatus, and then\nthere\u2019s your practical schedule guiding\nyou through, in the form of your pat-tern. Many a time have we at Knit Sock\nHQ heard \u2018oh, I\u2019m not creative\u2019. But\nthat\u2019s the beauty of it - you can be as\ncreative as you like because, at the end\nof the day, you just have to follow the\n\u2018practical schedule\u2019, and the technique\ncan\u2019t be that hard if your gran can do\nit and you\u2019re here doing a science de-gree. And for those of you who still\naren\u2019t convinced because you are too\nhard for knitting, there is such a thing\nas Extreme Knitting, which is knitting\nin inconceivable places - ideas are being thrown around with the Parkour\nsociety and the Underwater Club. And\nat the end of it all there you are, with\nyour very own garment; which is much\nbetter received as a gift than your well-cultured E.coli on an agar plate.\nA right bunch of knitters furiously churning out garments\nWho said knitting needles were pointless?\nSettling the battle of the sexes\nP\nicture the scene: a woman\nyells across a clearing at\nranks of men roaring on\nthe other side in a scene\nstrangely reminiscent of\nBraveheart. The camera pans to show\nranks of women standing behind\nher. They proceed to launch gender-specific munitions at each other. The\nmen kick footballs, the women throw\nweighted handbags. The whole image\ntells you: THIS IS WAR!\nSo a recent \u2018Mail on Sunday\u2019 TV\nadvert starts (check it on YouTube,\nit\u2019s hilarious), playing on\na seemingly age-old\ntruth, men and women are different and\nforever shall be, and these differences\nshall constantly fuel the battle of the\nsexes.\nThis \u2018all out war\u2019 in and of itself might\nnot be a bad thing, but when it comes\nto the relationships between men and\nwomen, which for some reason seems\nnecessary, the perceived acts of insanity by both sides tends to complicate\nthings, and few relationships survive.\nOver the last few weeks, a team of\nstudents from the Every Nation Christian Society have been accosting random people asking the question:\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your biggest gripe about the\nopposite sex?\u201d\nSeeking to be fair, we\nasked both men\nand women. The range of answers can\nbe seen in video form on Facebook\n(search for: \u201cunderstanding the opposite sex\u201d on the events page). Judging\nby the interviewees\u2019 answers, men find\nwomen complicated, whiny and possessing an irrational need for shopping,\nwhereas women find men insensitive,\ndishonest and unsupportive. When\nasked the following question:\n\u201cDo you think there is any hope of\never understanding the opposite sex?,\u201d\nmost people gave an emphatic \u201cno\u201d.\nThe two sexes are different, and\nthere is no escape from that fact. From\nwhat we are told, for instance, the little\nthings mean the world to women. They\nwant to know that others are listening,\nand they are important. A friend of\nmine (female) recently said that if a guy\nwere to earn brownie points, he\u2019d have\nto do it through the little things over\na period of time. Also, if ever a problem arises, the solution lies through\ndiscussion.\nMen enjoy the hunt, the fight and\nthe win. They crave to be the best, the\nstrongest, the fastest. The most obvious example of this is competitive\nsport. Imperial is not the most obvious place, so our men seek intellectual\nbrilliance. If a problem ever arises that\ncannot be tackled by brute force, the\nsolution lies in emotional detachment\nuntil the problem goes away.\nThese two completely different (and\nhighly stereotypical) types must now\ntry and live in proximity to each other\nwithout causing random violent eruptions if the human race is to continue\nin any meaningful sense. So we ask the\nquestion: how is this possible? How\ndo these two unlikely groups people\nmanage to deal with their differences\nand still be alive at the end of the day?\nI mean: he burps, farts and kicks a\nfootball at all who oppose him and she\nobsesses over shoes and shopping and\nstops talking about either of these only\nto briefly berate him for kicking said\nfootball.\nSo is that it? Are we doomed to forever misunderstand each other? Is\nValentine\u2019s Day to be a hit and hope?\nAnd if February 14th turns out to be\nthe start of a beautiful friendship, is it\ngoing to last?\nTo that end, this Tuesday 12th February at 6pm in SAF 120-121, a guy\nwho, having been married for about 20\nyears thinks it\u2019s possible to understand\nand successfully co-exist with the opposite sex, will be presenting his case.\nIt should make good listening. Who\nknows, he may even reveal the secrets\nto make the next one less painful than\nthe last one. In the meantime, there\u2019s\nalways Facebook.\nUnderstanding The Opposite Sex\nis being held by the Every Nation\nChristian Society on Tuesday 12th\nFebruary in SAF 120-121 at 6pm\nHe burps, she bitches. He swears, she shops. How do men and women really get along? The Every\nNation Christian Society will be asking just that at Tuesday\u2019s Understanding The Opposite Sex forum\nWhat is it that keeps men and women together?\n15\nFriday 8 February 2008 felix\n\n"

After back\nto back wins the team was on a high,\nwanting to extend their unbeaten run.\nThe fixture wasn\u2019t to be taken lightly\nas Surrey came top of the South East\ngroup last year and hoped for a repeat\nperformance.\nThe first minute saw Imperial score\nfirst, Jack Ellis finding the bottom corner from the centre forward position.\nSurrey responded instantly with a\npoorly defended long range shot, showing a hole in the IC defence. From that\nmoment Imperial stepped up a gear,\nwith the opposition only managing to\nget a couple of shots on target. Every\nstolen ball in defence resulted in an IC\ncounter attack, the Surrey keeper unable to save a series break away goals.\nThis pace continued throughout the\nfirst half, the Surrey team looking de-moralised during the half time break.\nIn the second half IC picked up from\nwhere they left off not allowing Surrey to get any quality possession. In\na strange turn of events the referee\nstopped play after a complaint by the\nobserving UCL players. Imperial were\naccused of swapping hats midway\nthrough the game, an illegal act which\nthreatened expulsion from the match.\nBemused by these unfounded claims\ncoach Adam Walzer consulted with\nthe referees and play was allowed to\nresume. Un-phased by the stoppage\nIC continued to dominate, with every\nplayer in the team getting their share\nof pool time.\nIt was clear towards the end that the\nofficials were taking pity on the tired\nSurrey team, giving a couple of unnecessary fouls against IC, these decisions were contested by Adam who\nwas subsequently yellow carded. The\nfinal score was 13-2, showing a gutsy\nperformance by the whole team. Special praise should be given to the team\u2019s\nnewer players, all of whom held their\nown and displayed confidence against\nan experienced Surrey team.\nA strong and confident Cambridge\nteam wait in the next round; however,\nImperial will take some beating on current match winning form.\nSurrey left dead in\nthe water by IC\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nSports Editor\nWhat a week it has been in sport, both\nat college and worldwide. The six nations kicked off this weekend and\nthings didn\u2019t go exactly as planned.\nFirstly Ireland were extremely disap-pointingly, or Italy were extremely\nimpressive depending which way you\nlook at it.

Yet\nsomehow in the second half they decided to stoop to a level of rugby that\nisn\u2019t even seen at schoolboy level and\nsubsequently lost to Wales.\nSunday\u2019s game was again a surprise,\nafter a fairly impressive performance\nin the World Cup, Scotland were expected to perform well against a young\nand relatively new French side who\nhad only been together for 4 days.\nAlthough there were initial signs of\npromise, the young French side were\nworryingly good and are going to be a\nserious threat in the competition.\nSunday also saw the 42nd Superbowl\nin Arizona between the New England\nPatriots and the New York Giants. The\nPatriots were expected to win this,\nhaving an unbeaten season till then,\nbut yet it seemed that the Giants just\nwanted to win it more, and as such it\nmade for a very exciting 4th quarter.\nIn football, Fabio Capello has brought\ninsomenewrulestotheEnglandsquad,\nhoping to bring more class and style to\nthe gentleman\u2019s game.

    "content": "science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience\nScience Editor \u2013 Ed Henley\n9\nFriday 8 February 2008 felix\nHot science: Cold prevention at IC\nE\narlier this month, a team of\nscientists headed by Imperial\u2019s Professor Sebastian\nJohnston announced in Nature Medicine that they have\nsuccessfully infected mice with rhino-viruses for the first time.\nIt had been previously thought that\nthese viruses, which cause about 75%\nof common colds, could only infect humans and chimps. Professor Johnston,\nfrom IC\u2019s MRC/Asthma UK Centre in\nAllergic Mechanisms of Asthma, says:\n\u201cUntil now it has not been possible to\nstudy rhinovirus infection in small ani-mals. This has been a major obstacle to\ndeveloping new treatments and there\nis currently no effective treatment for\nrhinovirus infection.\u201d\nThe reason for this \u201cimmunity\u201d of\nother animals to rhinoviruses is mainly\ndue to a binding molecule, found in\n90% of rhinoviruses, called ICAM-1.\nThis is found on the surface of human\ncells and it is this that the viruses use\nas a receptor to bind to the cells. Other\nsmaller animals do not have this recep-tor, and so as Professor Johnston says:\n\u201cthe virus couldn\u2019t infect the mouse cell\nbecause the receptor (acting like a door\nkey) couldn\u2019t get into the cell.\u201d His team\nmodified the receptor in mice, allowing\nthe infection into the cells.\nOver two weeks, the mice were then\nstudied for any symptoms and had\ntheir lung fluid analysed for the presence of mucus proteins and interfer-ons, cytokines and chemokines \u2013 proteins produced by the immune system\nin response to infections.\nWhilst rhinoviruses are at worst an\ninconvenience to most of the popula-tion, they can have severe and even fatal consequences for some. For asthma\nsufferers like myself they can trigger\nasthma attacks, pneumonia in people\nwith weakened immune systems, and\nchronic bronchitis and emphysema.\nThe team combined exposure to\nSally Longstaff reports on how a team at Imperial is leading the way in tackling the common cold, by\ninfecting mice with rhinoviruses. Great news for asthma sufferers, but cold comfort for the sniffly mice...\nthe virus with an allergic reaction to\novalbumin (found in egg white) and\nobserved that the mice showed similar symptoms to humans when asthma\nis worsened by a viral infection. At\npresent the only preventative measure\nfor virally-induced asthma attacks is to\nuse steroids, only partially effective.\nAs the mice responded similarly to\nhumans, this leads to hopes that they\nI\u2019ll warn you at the outset that this is\nrather a navel-gazing article, as the\ntopic for today\u2019s story has been chosen for somewhat ulterior motives. I\u2019ll\nreveal those motives at the end, when\nit\u2019s time for some editorialising. In the\nmeantime, it\u2019s high time for an expla-nation: how could the ionosphere and\nthe 2004 tsunami possibly be linked?\nOn the face of it, it is hard to see how\none might affect the other. The 2004\ntsunami (triggered by a magnitude ~9.2\nearthquake off the coast of Sumatra on\nthe 26th of December) powerful as it\nmay have been, occurred at sea level.\nThe ionosphere, an electrically conductive layer of the atmosphere (the\nhighest one, in fact) lies far above, between 85-600 km altitude. And though\nit forms the upper edge of the atmos-phere, potentially linking it to events\nlower down, it is also the lower edge\nof the magnetosphere \u2013 the\nbubble-like region\nwhich Earth\u2019s magnetic field carves\nout of the solar\nwind, a flow of\nplasma streaming outwards past\nus from the sun. The\nionophere\u2019s location and\nconductive nature means that\nchanges in the solar wind and magnet-osphere, such as those associated with\naurorae, can have significant effects on\nthe ionosphere.\nAnother main cause of change in\nthe ionosphere is also due to the sun:\nradiation. The ionosphere is electrically conducting because radiation at\nfrequencies from UV and above ionises the neutral atoms, leaving a cloud\nof ions and electrons. Though these\nattract each other, and so should potentially recombine, the atmosphere at\nionospheric altitudes is so tenuous that\nthis cloud of charged particles can persist for long times, as a plasma, providing the generation mechanism \u2013 the\nsun \u2013 is visible, offsetting any losses\ndue to recombination. At night, when\nthe sun has no effect, the number of\ncharged particles decreases greatly.\nSome of you may have had practical\nexperience of this, if you listen to longwave radio stations: the signals bounce\noff the ionosphere, at an altitude where\nthe number of free electrons floating\naround causes that layer to become\nopaque to radio waves, and act like a\nmirror instead. As this altitude\nchanges over the course of a\nday, it affects the range of\nradio signals: a higher\nlayer means signals\nfrom further away\ncan be picked up.\nHowever, iono-spheric changes are\nalso due to atmospheric ef-fects, which may in turn be due to\nchanges all the way down at the sur-face. And it\u2019s this type of mechanism\nwhich American researchers publishing in the Journal of Geophysical Research a few weeks ago think might\nexplain their observations. They were\nusing the Arecibo radio dish on Puerto\nRico to probe the ionosphere around\nthe time of the tsunami, and found that\nabut 25 hours after that event, an unexpected rise and fall in one ionospheric\nlayer occurred. Unusual, because it occurred at night, and when there was\nlittle magnetospheric activity, immediately ruling out two of the above causes for ionospheric changes. Nor did it\nlook like this was due to waves caused\nby a storm \u2013 there were none nearby at\nthe time. Instead, Lee et al. suggest that\nthe tsunami waves on the ocean caused\nassociated gravity waves (nothing to do\nwith space-time: these are waves due\nto fluid parcels being displaced into\nregions of different density \u2013 gravity\nor buoyancy acts as a restoring force,\ncausing oscillation about an equiib-rium) in the atmosphere. The effects of\nthese gravity waves leaked into the ion-osphere, causing the variations seen at\nArecibo, and also by various GPS satel-lites, which are sensitive to the electron\ncontent of the ionosphere.\nWhat has this got to do with the\nScience and Technologies Facilities\nCouncil (STFC), the body which funds\nastronomical, space science and particle physics research in the UK? Keen\nreaders of science news amongst you\nmay have spotted that the STFC is\ngoing through a funding crisis at the\nmoment \u2013 there\u2019s an \u00a380 million hole\nin its budget, which threatens swinge-ing cuts in many areas. Notably in the\ncould provide models of rhinovirus in-fection, whch the researchers conclude\ncould be useful when investigating\ntreatments for both the common cold\nand asthma. These findings could also\ndevelop further, aiding research into\nother conditions, including chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease.\nThe research was funded by the\nMedical Research Council, Asthma UK\nand GlaxoSmithKline. Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, chief executive of the Medical\nResearch Council, said: \u201cThis important and fundamental discovery will\nenable us to understand the effects rhi-noviruses and common colds have on\nour health. It will open up new paths\nto finding treatments which have been\ndelayed for many years and provides\nus with the opportunities for further\nbreakthroughs in the future.\u201d\nThis experiment is of great interest\nto the scientific community, and many\nnewspapers and other publications\nhave lauded this as a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d.\nMice are often used as models of disease and to test treatments. Because\npreviously the rhinovirus was only able\nto infect higher primates, this made\nresearch difficult. By finding a way to\ninfect mice, this study represents a very\nsignificant step forward.\nHowever, animal models of human\ndisease are a very early step and it may\ntake many years for new treatments to\nbecome available. A significant obtacle,\namongst other problems, is that viruses\nhave many different strains; developing\na treatment that will cure every cold\nwill be nigh on impossible.\nIt is also important to consider the\nrisks of overprescribing medication.\nThe common cold, as mentioned, is\na mere irritant to most of the popula-tion, and only dangerous to a few. The\nwidespread use of medications to treat\ncommon colds may lead to the development of resistant strains \u2013 potentially threatening to the most susceptible.\nDishy: the Arecibo radio telescope is really rather a looker\nThe 2004 tsunami, the ionosphere, Arecibo and the STFC: all connected?\nresearch area which the above study\nbelongs to: STFC has said it will \u201ccease\nall support for ground-based solar-ter-restrial physics facilities\u201d. This is where\nI need to confess something: I might\nnot be entirely objective here, as my\nresearch area involves looking at part\nof the magnetospheric system. My area\ndoes not directly look quite so threat-ened, yet for various personal reasons,\nI see the loss of UK solar-terrestrial\nphysics ground facilities as a blow.\nYou see, the UK is really rather good\nat solar terrestrial physics, and puts its\nfacilities to good use. I almost went to\ndo my Ph.D. at Leicester, a particularly\nstrong institute currently under threat,\nas I was attracted to their way of viewing the complicated interactions from\nthe solar wind all the way down to the\natmosphere as one cohesive system,\nwhich needs to be treated as such to be\nunderstood. The above study is a nice\nexample of energy transfer between\nregions covered by different funding\ncouncils: the STFC above, and the\nNatural Environment Research Council below. At a time when we recognise\nthe need to understand the processes\naffecting climate, surely it is foolish to\nsquander world-class expertise in an\narea interacting with climatic science,\nmerely because the funding councils\ndefine a remit boundary at a particular\naltitude, a boundary which is flouted in\nat least this case, and likely in others?\nSNIFFLEZ\nSNIFFLEZ\nI CAN HAS TISHOOZ?\nI CAN HAS TISHOOZ?\nEdmund Henley\n\n"

It\u2019s on\nJames Finnerty explains what one of the largest tech mergers ever really means\nO\nnce again welcome to\nthe wonderfully gadget\npacked corner of the\nnewspaper. We\u2019ve had\na fair bit of news this\nweek in the Tech world so lets bring\neveryone up to speed. With all the big\nnews on Microsoft and Yahoo! we have\ndelivered coverage on this as well as a\nslightly overlooked product in Microsoft\u2019s arsenal.\nOnce again Apple have updated\nsome of their products. Their products have been filling these pages for\na few weeks but thankfully their most\nrecent announcement is brief enough\nto mention here. The iPhone and iPod\ntouch have had their storage capacities\nincreased.\nAt the moment there exists 4Gb and\n8Gb iPhones aswell as 8Gb and 16Gb\ntouches. On Tuesday the 16Gb iPhone\nbecame available for about \u00a360 more\nthan the 8Gb and a 32Gb iPod touch\nshould be in the shops in a few days,\nmaybe even by the time of going to\nprint. Also, any new touch purchased\nincluded the new applications that you\nwould have to pay for on any older\nones.\nHeathrow has started testing new\nsecurity measures that will be implemented in Terminal 5. The guinea pigs\nof the new system will have the pleasure of providing a blood, urine and\nstool samples as well as iris scans. Only\nkidding, they just take a photo and\nyour prints, but this has added heat to\nrecent discussions about giving the US\naccess to UK biometric databases.\nNokia are making their long announced concept of shifting its NGage gaming platform to smartphones\na reality. The first phone to have this is\nthe N81 so anyone using one of these\nshould be able get more games and\nsome clever sods have got the platform\nworking on pretty much every Symbian S60 phone.\nHere\u2019s one for all the environmentalists out there. Airbus have successfully\ntest flown an A380 that is fueled by a\nsynthetic fuel produced from natural\ngas. The test flight used a cocktail of\n60% regular jet fuel and 40% synthetic\nwith plans to increase the ratio in favor\nof the synthetic fuel in upcoming tests.\nThis change is expected to make a significant impact on the airline industry\u2019s global footprint. But will this be\nenough to satisfy the hippies? Maybe\nfor now.\nAn IBM research paper has been dug\nup which reveals their future plans to\ntake over the world, I mean internet,\nalthough I think there are a fair few\npeople who can\u2019t tell the difference an-ymore. They plan to modify their Blue\nGene super computer architecture to\nsupport traditionally server executed\nfunctions such as Apache and MySQL\nas these tasks require larger levels of\ncomputing power.\nYou may remember that during the\nlast American election there was a high\nlevel of distrust in the electronic ballet\nsystem. Well shock horror all the fears\nhave surfaced once again so expect to\nsee ten recounts of the upcoming super Tuesday votes before the next stage\nof the election in November.\nLets move on to the articles.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nTechnology\nTechnology Editor \u2013 James Finnerty\nJames Finnerty\nTechnology Editor\nAfter a decade online and heading towards a downard spiral, will Microsoft take charge?\nA\nhuge rock was thrown\ninto the calm pond of\nGoogle'sfuturethisweek.\nMicrosoft have offered a\nstaggering \u00a322 billion to\nbuy the long standing Yahoo! search\nengine company. Now why would they\ndo this? Their key product is sub-par\nwith millions of people drifting over to\nthe big G monthly, making this appear\na very bad investment. The reasoning\ncomes from Microsoft's Steve Ballmer\nexplaining that the purchase is intended to increase Microsoft's audience,\nimprove the brand of both companies\nand to literally build a bigger company\nthat can rival Google.\nThis buy out will mean a huge deal to\nanyone currently lucky enough to own\nshares in these companies. Microsoft's\nshare price has famously been more or\nless static for the last 5 years and due\nto Google, Yahoo! shares have been on\nthe downward spiral. How this purchase will affect Google's value is yet to\nbe seen but if their lower than promised quarterly profits are anything to\ngo by people may start to stray.\nOther sources have reported that\nMicrosoft executives plan to move\nmore into the online services market\nand hence wanting the Yahoo! brand.\nSounds great on paper as Google\ndominates this market, how this will\naffect the products produced by each\nside will be one to watch as Google has\nalways updated and improved it's services irrelevant of the competition.\nRumours are also floating around\nthat someone may have a rival bid in\nthe works. Now this really poses the\nquestion what other company has \u00a322\nbillion to place in a high risk buy out?\nI don't really see any oil or car companies buying a search engine and the\nonly other tech company that could be\ninterested would be Apple, who aren't\nones to take on other companies prod-ucts. Could this mean Google would\ntry and buy Yahoo! just to stop Microsoft doing it? But this would increase\ntheir monopoly and thus risk having\nthe company divided so it\u2019s not a likely\noption.\nIf the purchase is successful the next\nhurdle to overcome is how MicroHoo!\nwill merge their business models to\ncompete with Google. The breaker is\nthat Google famously uses large clusters of cheap computers and a system\nof distributing tasks to these modes\nthat handles machine failure without\nbreaking a sweat. This strategy is very\ncost effective and provides a high level\nof reliability. MS and Y! on the other\nhand are known for buying more compact \u201chigh quality\u201d systems were the\nreliability of each machine is more\nimportant. Ultimately this costs them\nmore money and they still end up less\nreliable. We've all had MSN Messenger and Hotmail go down due to busy\nservers, but when did you last see this\nhappen to Google?\nTo fix these kinds of problems would\ntake a very brave move from Microsoft\nas they would most likely have to stray\nfrom their own homebrew software or\nspend millions/billions of dollars and\nwaste years producing their own replacement system from scratch. A big\nask on top of what they have already\nblown buying Yahoo! in the first place.\nThere are growing concerns about\nwhether or not Microsoft will properly support what is broadly accepted\nas Yahoo!'s greatest achievement, their\nBill, I have a cunning plan, all I need is \u00a322 billion and a turnip\nsupport for software developers. Via\ntheir developers network Yahoo! has\nactually maintained a good business\nmodel that allowed it to survive the\nend of the internet boom. The key to\nthis is extending your platform to increase users and this allowed Yahoo! to\nkeep afloat, albeit not as successfully as\nsome of it's rivals. The question lies in\nwhether Microsoft will want to merge\nits popular developer's network with\nYahoo!'s incarnation, producing a one\nstop shop for coders, or go along with\nsome sort of internal rivalry between\nthe departments.\nA lot of people also feel that the\nmerge of these two companies is fundamentally set to fail as they have drastically different philosophies. Yahoo!\nhas played a hand in the open source\nworld where as Microsoft has been the\nantithesis of this, sticking to the traditional method of charging users for\ntheir products instead of using methods such as advertisement to generate\nrevenue.\nAs an interesting note, Google have\nquestioned Microsoft\u2019s bid and have\nasked for the regulators to verify that\nthe purchase is sound. Could this be\nGoogle quaking in its boots? They have\nalso argued that Microsoft\u2019s decision\ngoes along with its history of trying to\nobtain a monopoly, but the problem\nwith this accusation is that the market\nof advertising which MicroHoo! would\nbe trying to take on is almost already\nmonopolised by Google. So basically\nwe\u2019ve got two big babies arguing over\nwho gets to have a bigger share of the\ninternet.\nIn my opinion Google is the one\ncausing this to happen though. If they\ndidn\u2019t have such a large market share\nthen Microsoft and Yahoo! would not\nhave to merge to stand a chance of success in the hostile internet market.\nIf Yahoo! accpet this offer they will be\nconfessing that they themselves could\nnot turn their company around which\nmay cause a lack of confidence in their\nmanagement, but it will still be a relief to those not wanting the company\nto fail. There is still a huge chance of\nfailure even if the merger goes ahead.\nIf MicroHoo! cannot output products\nthat genuinely are of better quaity than\nGoogle then this could destroy both of\nthe companies leaving Google with a\nmonopoly.\nSo will this be the birth of the greatest\ntechnology company ever or will it be a\nwaste of time and money from some of\nthe only serious rivals to Google? Only\ntime will tell.\n\n"

    "content": "6 felix Friday 8 February 2008\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment\nSponsored by:\nWeighing up the cost of fair trade\nE\nveryone who digs deep\nenough in Felix every week\nto get as far as this page\nprobably also noticed that\nImperial has recently become a Fairtrade University. Among\nother things this has to do with the fact\nthat every coffee you buy on campus\n(as well as every tea and many of the\nother treats supplied by College Catering) is Fairtrade certified. As a member\nof Imperial\u2019s Fairtrade Society it surprises me regularly to see how many of\nthose coffee and tea drinkers are completely ignorant about the meaning of\nthe term Fairtrade. So I was glad to see\nthat someone has enough interest in\nthe topic to raise it in the last issue of\nFelix where \u201cMatt the Hat\u201d expresses\nconcerns about how fair Fairtrade is to\nthe consumer and whether free trade\nmight be fairer than Fairtrade. These\nare two interesting questions but I\nthink Matt missed a point on both of\nthem.\nWhy are Fairtrade things always so\nmuch more expensive than the \u201cnormal\u201d stuff? Well, to start with: They\naren\u2019t. When Imperial\u2019s coffees became\nFairtrade two years ago the price didn\u2019t\nrise. And if you go to the supermarket you will notice that sometimes the\nFairtrade coffee is in fact cheaper than\nthe non-Fairtrade. Admittedly, these\nare exceptions.\nThere are cases where retailers want\nto earn from people\u2019s consciousness\nabout issues such as Fairtrade. For a\ncup of cappuccino which I was told\ncosts more than \u00a32 on the high street,\nthe farmer sees 1.5p on average. If the\nFairtrade version costs more, this is\nfor three main reasons: the fraction of\na penny the farmer gets more for his\nproduct, the higher cost of distributing Fairtrade products because they\nstill have a smaller market and last, but\ndefinitely not least, the retailer\u2019s greed.\nIf the latter takes over, even I as a Fairtrade supporter would advise you to\nvote with your feet and walk to a different coffee shop.\nNow Matt asks where the free market\nisinthiscase.Idon\u2019tknowhowhecould\nmiss it! Having the choice between two\ndifferent products, Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade, and the choice of where to\nbuy either, how could the market be\nfreer and fairer? As opposed to the EU,\nFairtrade does not subsidise produc-ers. Let me explain this with the example of Fairtrade footballs (yes, they do\nexist). 90% of the world\u2019s footballs are\nproduced in Pakistan and while no one\ncounted it is believed that a good 30%\nare produced by child labourers. I have\nthe option of buying the cheap football\nmade by a child who will never go to\nschool and one that is made by an adult\nwho earns a wage that I would consider\nappropriate for making me a football.\nAnd there is the factory owner who has\nthe choice of employing children and\npaying them next to nothing or fulfilling a range of criteria to become Fairtrade certified. This is the free market with two products competing for\ndemand. Subsidies are nowhere to be\nseen in Fairtrade. Just ask yourself: Is\nit a subsidy if a Jaguar X-Type is more\nexpensive than a Ford Mondeo?\nFairtrade should also not be confused with charity. Matt remembers\nthe principle of \u201chow people prefer\nfishing rods over truckloads of fish\u201d.\nGiving people the fishing rods is exactly what Fairtrade does. When farmers use the Fairtrade premium they are\npaid to make their production organic\nso they can sell it for higher prices, the\nFairtrade premium was like a fishing\nrod to them.\nMatt is right about one thing though:\nsince Fairtrade relies on the free market we need the economy to \u201ctip back\nin their favour\u201d. In plain English that\nmeans if we don\u2019t buy Fairtrade footballs no one will produce them any\nmore. That\u2019s why I think everyone of\nus should find out enough about Fairtrade to make a conscious decision as\nto whether to buy Fairtrade footballs or\nnot. And if you don\u2019t need a football, it\nalso works with coffee, or tea, or choc-olate, anything you can dream of!\nHaving said this I will use the last few\nsentences of this letter to shamelessly\nplug the current campaign run by Imperial\u2019s Fairtrade Society. Because we\nwant to raise awareness of Fairtrade\nwe invite everyone to ask their question about Fairtrade (critical comments phrased as questions are also\nvery welcome). I won\u2019t mention all the\ncool prizes you can win by taking part\non www.imperialfairtrade.org.uk.\nJonas Neubert\nBrown gold for some; fair trade can help make it profitable for all\n\u201c\nI think\neveryone of us\nshould find out\nenough about\nFairtrade to make\na conscious\ndecision as\nto whether to\nbuy Fairtrade\nfootballs or\nnot\n\u201d\n\n"

So are you missing out by eating a high protein diet\ninstead?\nUnfortunately, as those magazines\nare also loaded with adverts for those\nself-same products they are endorsing,\nit is safe to assume that they are less\nthan objective. So what\u2019s the truth?\nHow do protein powder and protein\nsupplements in general stack up against\nprotein rich foods such as meat, beans,\negg whites or dairy? The reality is that\nprotein powders / supplements will\nnot build more muscle than chicken\nor egg whites or any other whole food\nprotein - their big advantage is their\nconvenience.\nI have always been an advocate of\nconsuming whole foods as much as\npossible. What I mean by \u2018whole foods\u2019\nis foods that have not been altered or\nbroken down from their original, natural state, or at least as little as possible\n(e.g. whole turkey breast vs. packaged\nturkey meat slices). Some great whole\nfood lean protein choices would be:\nchicken/turkey breast, egg whites, fish,\ncottage cheese, tofu, legumes, extra\nlean cuts of beef\u2026etc. That being said,\nI have been consuming whey protein\nshakes and bars for the last 5 years. Let\nme explain - it all comes down to life-style. The reality is that like most peo-ple, I have extremely busy days. When\nI am seeing clients for 5 to 8 hours in\na row, I don\u2019t have time to slam down\na chicken breast with sweet potatoes\nand asparagus (I\u2019m getting hungry just\nthinking about it!). So I grab a shake\nor a bar, which gives me the right nutrients that I need to keep my body in\ncheck. By the way, I give my busy clients the exact same advice. Most people end up skipping meals, which is the\nworst thing you can do if you want lose\nfat and build lean muscle tissue. Protein supplements are a \u201cNo Excuse\u201d solution for keeping up with your health\nplan.\nWhey protein is now the most popular protein supplement, and is touted\nfor having the highest biological value.\nThis basically means that it is more\neasily broken down by our bodies\nthan animal or vegetable proteins, and\ntherefore quickly provides your muscle\ncells with the nutrients it needs after\na workout. The reason for this is that\nwhey protein is higher in essential\namino acids and BCAA (branch-chain\namino acids). It can also be a better source of protein for those of you\nwanting to lose body fat, because it is\ngenerally lower in fat and carbs then\nmost whole food counterparts.

Don\u2019t do drugs, kids\nD\nrugs and Art. It is very\neasy to start thinking\nabout the hordes of art-ists,musiciansandactors\nwho have been dedicated\nfollowers of the narcotic tradition that\nseems to often follow a rise to fame:\nevery rock star in the sixties, seventies\nand eighties; Jim Morrison, the Stones,\nJanis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, the whole of\nGuns \u2018N Roses and so on ad infinitum.\nNowadays things seem to have cleaned\nup, so much so that there are only a few\ntrue party animals that spring to mind\n(Winehouse and Doherty). What we\nare dealing with here is not artists who\ntake drugs, but instances where drugs\nhave affected art in various forms. And\ngiven that the ingestion of chemicals,\nprescribed or not, is deeply seated in\nhuman nature, society and culture, this\narticle seems a little futile; especially\nconsidering how many examples of\nthis there are.\nFrom the dawn of time, civilisations\nhave taken drugs to enhance mood,\nbring people together, awaken inner\nthoughts and emotions and as part of\nreligious ceremonies. It is, therefore,\nobvious how such things can aid one in\nthe plight of artistic creation.\nThe Wooster group is a performing\narts troupe from New York who took\nLSD (Lysergic acid diethylamide, discovered in 1938 by Albert Hofmann)\nin 1984 in rehearsal and filmed themselves performing a play. Afterwards,\nthey emulated their actions whilst on\nthe drug and it became \u201cL.S.D. (\u2026Just\nthe High Points\u2026)\u201d. Among the actors\nwere Willem Dafoe (Spiderman) and\nSteve Buscemi (Conair). This is an example of drugs being used as an artistic\naid to bring something new to a performance and to shed a new light on\nideas the creators had for the play.\nAnother instance whereby \u201cart\u201d has\nbeen carried out under the influence of\nthe same drug is in a US Government\nexperiment during the 1950s. A patient was given 50 micrograms of LSD\nand instructed to draw his doctor at\nhourly intervals. As time progressesd,\nthe drawings become more and more\nminimalist and less representative of\nthe subject matter. Obviously, the influence of drugs on an artist and their\nwork comes from memory of a drug\nexperience. As can be seen from the\ndrawings done under the influence of\nLSD, if artists were to create art whilst\non a drug, their works would be sham-bolic and potentially senseless!\nA literal example of drug and art is\nPill Wheels by Fred Tomaselli. In 1996\nhe created patterns using assorted pills\nand capsules, acrylic and resin on a\nwood panel. It had to be removed from\na museum in New York due to the potential risk of drug addicts trying to\nsequester the pills from the surface of\nthe wood panel. It also posed a problem at airports when immigration officials saw it as a possible method of\ndrug smuggling. Some of the more\nridiculous critics also saw it as a way\nof condoning drug use! Another of Tomaselli\u2019s works is a collage made up of\nplasters and nicotine patch; perhaps\nthis work was seen as a waste of patches which could have otherwise been\nused to cure smokers of their cigarette\naddiction.\nReams of singers have immortalised and praised their beloved heroin\nin songs; so much so that it no longer\nseems a very original subject matter for\u2026 any type of art. The Rolling\nStones\u2019 Brown Sugar; Guns \u2018N Roses\u2019\nMr. Brownstone and Strangler\u2019s Golden Brown. When I was ten, my more\ninnocent mind thought Brown Sugar\nwas an ode to a particularly lovely\nBlack girl. In some ways, infatuation\nwith a person may be akin to a drug\naddiction. Both are damaging in different ways. Jimi Hendrix, guitar God\nand genius, sang of Purple Haze (LSD\ninfused marijuana).\nAuthors and poets have also used\ntheir trips to gain inspiration for literary pieces. Samuel Taylor Coleridge,\nthe founder of the Romantic move-ment, was an avid nitrous oxide user\nand also harboured an opium addic-tion. His poem Kubla Khan is an extract from a particularly vivid opium-induced dream he once had. It is also\nrumoured Lewis Carroll ingested the\nergot fungus (whence comes LSD)\nfrom which sprung ideas for his classics Alice in Wonderland and Alice\nThrough the Looking Glass.\nIt begs the question: do people take\ndrugs because they are creative, or are\nthey creative because of the experiences they have had on drugs? Definitely not the latter \u2013 creativity is not\nconjured simply from drug taking, as\nattractive as that idea is. Instead, perhaps creative people are sometimes\nmore open to ideas and experience\nand so are more likely to try drugs and\nuse them as a catalyst to art. That is\nnot to say one needs drugs to enhance\nour artistic capabilities. Salvador Dali\ndidn\u2019t believe that. \u201cI don\u2019t do drugs. I\nam drugs. Take me, I am the drug; take\nme, I am hallucinogenic.\u201d Indeed, his\npaintings are very surreal and anyone\nwishing to trip out without polluting\ntheir blood and brains should take a\nlook at his art. The notion of \u201ctaking\u201d a\nhuman being was taken to the extreme\nby Keith Richards when he snorted\nhis father\u2019s ashes. No small feat by any\nmeans: an urn full of ashes would have\ntaken tens, or hundreds, of sessions to\nfinish, I am sure and would not have\ngone down as well as other snortable\nillegals. However, that has nothing to\ndo with art, only the eccentricities of\nan artist.\nScience fuelled inspiration for art\nwhen, in 1954, maverick scientist John\nLilly conducted a set of experiments\nbased on sensory deprivation research\nin isolation tanks. He was administered a variety of drugs including LSD\nand ketamine. He was injected with\n2-hourly doses of the \u201chorse tranquiliser\u201d for 3 weeks during which he claims\nto have communicated with alien and\ngod-like entities. Ketamine is actually\nused in combination with other sedatives on the elderly, children and small\nanimals, although the notion of a horse\ntranquiliser is all the more amusing.\nThe research was the basis for the plot\nof the 1980 Ken Russell film Altered\nStates. \u201cIn the province of the mind\nthere are no limits\u201d, said Lilly. And he is\ncompletely right. Our brain is so complex that we have not even scratched\nthe surface of possibilities. By using\ndrugs which alter perception and shed\na new light on things, we can only increase the possibilities. However, this\nis not an advocation for abuse; anything used to excess for long periods of\ntime will have a detrimental effect.\nOne person who did encourage the\nuse of mind-altering psychedelics was\nTimothy Leary, psychologist and author of Turn on, Tune in, Drop out.\nThe phrase was thought up by Leary\nas a catchy means to promote the benefits of LSD; the book was a compilation of essays on religion, neurology,\neducational psychology, politics and,\nof course, drugs.\nDuring the sixties, when LSD was\nstill legal, the youth often misinterpreted the phrase to mean: turn onto\ndrugs, tune into the counterculture\nand drop out of school. Instead, Leary\nmeant turn on/activate your neuro-nal and genetic equipment; tune into\nand act harmoniously with the world\naround you; drop out and detach from\nconvention.\nGiven the myriad chemicals out\nthere yet to be discovered, coupled to\nthe infinite possibilities from a multitude of human brains, it is a comforting\nthought to know that we will never run\nout of inspiration for something which\nmakes life, and our world, infinitely\nmore pleasing and beautiful \u2013 art.

As a consequence,\nI don\u2019t like Marmite, have little patience for scatological in-nuendo, and speak more than\none language. Despite this, I\nthink I\u2019m adapting fairly well to the\ncustoms of this sceptred isle. In one\nthing, though, I continually display my\nignorance; and that is when it comes to\nchoosing newspapers.\nEvery country has its own wide selection of newspapers: those catering for\nall colours of the political spectrum,\nthose dedicated to the entertainment-seekers, and those designed for the\nsports-mad. Yet few others countries\nhave the same national divisions along\npaper lines. Here, you are judged immediately by the sort of newspaper you\nread. Choose a paper and your position\nis carved in stone. You will be accepted\nby fellow readers of that newspaper and\nhave your position ridiculed by everyone else. In this country, the choice of\nM\ny rainy Tuesday\nstarted with a rather\npredictable headline \u201cMalawi severs\nlinks with Taiwan\u201d\nscrawled across the BBC website.\nAs some of you may be aware of the\nproblem across the Taiwanese strait,\nit is not uncommon to see developing\ncountries switch recognition between\nTaipei and Beijing. While this should\nhave been a proud honoured political statement by Malawi to declare\ntheir stance of political ideology akin\nto UK standing behind US in international issues, Malawi\u2019s moves have\nnow been reduced to mere squabbling\nover which side they can squeeze more\nfinancial gain out of. Rumours of the\nMarshall Island following suit are also\nbeing reported.\nWhat really annoyed me wasn\u2019t really the move, I respect people for\nchoosing their sides and in a harsh\nworld \u2013 yes \u2013 the abandoned side gets\nhurt. But what really fucked me up was\nthe statement the Malawian officials\nmade a day before the announcement:\n\u201cMalawi had only recently denied it\nhad switched its allegiances from Taipei to Beijing\u201d. I mean, for goodness\u2019\nsake, have some guts and balls to say\nyou are going to do whatever you think\nis right. Don\u2019t go around telling people\nyou are one thing, and then backstab\nthem afterwards \u2013 stab them there and\nthen \u2013 make your word accountable.\nHow can any nation be of any integrity\nif they go back on their word?\nIn some ways the US defiance of the\nUN and invading Iraq is better: they\u2019ve\ngot the guts to do so. No wonder some\nnations stay small and insignificant.\nIn some ways I admire Chavez, Ahmadinejad, and Juan Carlos for saying\nwhat\u2019s on their minds rather than some\npolitically correct shyte. Be direct,\nstate your point, and say the unsayable!\nHow satisfying was it when the King\nreprimanded Chavez to shut up!\nWhen will we hear the Fukuda tell\nthe Chinese to \u201cjust drop the past!\u201d? Or\nwhen could the Latvians tell the Russian to \u201csod off\u201d about some statues?\nHave some balls\nGiramondo\nGilead Amit\nRead between the headlines\nprint media defines the person.\nMy situation is further complicated\nby the fact that I have not yet understood these subtle distinctions. I still\ndon\u2019t know which newspaper represents which position. Even more prob-lematically, I\u2019m not even sure which\nposition I hold, or would like to be\nseen as holding. My knowledge is really very limited. When I walk into a\nnewsagents\u2019 with a friend, which paper do I pick up? This one has a fairly\nconservative-looking typeface but uses\nthree exclamation marks in the head-lines. That one has a heavily pixellated\npicture of what I can only imagine is a\nsinning celebrity; this one has a completely pixel-free version of the same\npicture. Which one to choose? Is the\nGuardian a good choice for a cynic\nwith little interest in sports and even\nless interest in economics? Will the Independent satiate my craving for celebrity gossip? Can the Spectator rival the\nTimes on Sunday for theatre reviews?\nWill the News of the World be proofread this week? Which paper should I\ntake? What to do?\nThe names stare at me from the rack.\nThe Guardian. The Times. The Daily\nTelegraph, the Daily Mail, the Evening\nStandard. I take a wild guess and assume that the Star and the Sun are\nnot the most literary of choices. I have\nalso learned (the hard way) that Metro\nand the London Paper are not for the\ndiscerning newsreader, but that really\ndoesn\u2019t narrow the field.\nAll I really know is that everyone\nloves jumping on the Daily Mail \u2013 figuratively and literally. I have no idea\nmyself, of course, but I think I may\nget funny looks later on if I admit to\nreading it. Better leave it. How about\nthe Times? Ah, now obviously I know\nabout the Times. This is the RollsRoyce of newspapers, even though it\nhas been reduced to tabloid format.\nThe intelligent man\u2019s newspaper. Or\nis it? Maybe it\u2019s become too popular.\nMaybe that\u2019s the latest fashion and\nI\u2019m just jumping on the bandwagon. I\ndon\u2019t like being a follower \u2026 I should\nbe a trendsetter. Choose a paper that\nno-one ever reads, like the Observer.\nOr the Financial Times \u2013 meaningless numbers, statistics, and symbols\nbacked by incomprehensible pseudo-theory. I am studying physics, so it\nshould be right up my street.\nWhat\u2019s the fashionable man about\ntown reading this winter? Do I decide\nbased on font size? Number of pages?\nBreast size of centrefold? Complexity\nof crossword? Percentage of paper given over to the sports section? Number\nof swear words in the headlines? Or\nshould I decide based on something as\npedestrian as price?\nIn all honesty, I can\u2019t decide on a real\nnewspaper to read. I think I\u2019ll just stick\nto Felix.\nW\nhat's the opposite\nof blind? No, not\n20/20. The other\nend of the spec-trum, like when\nWeirdos yank your eyeballs out, lick\nthem and suck them before squeezing\nthem (now lubricated, so it\u2019s easy) back\ninto your eye sockets for you to see the\nworld through the eyes of a Weirdo.\nWell, I feel like I have been Weirdo-d\nby Photoshop.\nEverywhere I look, Design gets there\nfirst, fooling me with its trendy curves,\nwell-chosen font and minimalist col-ours. Or its sexy, macro-shot, soft-lit\nChicken McHeartAttack. Or its com-forting, wood-panelled homely feel reminding me of my days spent catching\nbutterflies and frolicking gaily through\nmy grandad's corn-field while he took\na midday siesta underneath the old apple tree. In Birmingham.\nMy Incredible Imperial Intellect (III)\ndeduced a long time ago that the real\nworld was in hiding. Every now and\nthen I think I get a glimpse of truth\nonly to realise that the girl is only\nsobbing like that because EastEnders\ntaught her how Sadness Looks. It all\ngets a bit vague. Once though, I saw a\nsleeping tramp! But I was so mortified\nat the Gritty Real World Drama that I\nquickly graffitied his face with my my\nbiro, covering it in ironic dollars. How\nterribly LOL. I took a photo and pho-toshopped it just to be sure.\nIt seems we are wading through a\nman-made veneer. There is so much\ncomment, image and reverse-neo-post-modern-not-reallyness that getting to golden nuggets of actual truth is\nexhausting. By the way I'm a Muslim.\nStop. Wait.\nI say it because even my beloved faith\nhas been coated with a cultural varnish.\nOne that needs to be stripped.\nOn the one hand we have the incredible unifying effect of a common religious tongue and a consistent criterion\nof belief. Stealing its glory is a forced\nsynonymity between Islam and the\narabesque (or pakiesque). I don't see\nthe Pope rolling around in sandpits or\nsitting on radiators to celebrate the historic land of Nazareth. Similarly there\nis a cultural cage of sands and snakes,\ncamels and caravans, turbans and Taliban that surrounds Islam in the modern psyche. It alienates me as a Muslim\ntoo.\nIt does injustice to the universality of\nIslam's message. Of course there is the\nSunnah, the importance and adherence\nto the actions of the Prophet (pbuh)\nas an example unto humanity, coming with it things that are superficially\nlinked to Middle Eastern culture; but\nfor deep contentment there requires a\nharmony between faith and one's environmental and social framework.\nWhat is the red pill? To unplug from\nthis alienating Matrix of media and image to intellectual Terra Firma? Knowledge. Proper, bookish facts. And fighting fire with fire: a generation carving\na new niche in a new habitat.\nAnd thus I come subtly to Islamic\nAwareness Week. Some misguided\nmistake put me in a position of responsibility (and power*), and I am ecstatic\nto see the rappers, the clean aesthetic,\nthe history of 'Islamic' invention and\nthe multitude of ethnic backgrounds\ninvolved, as well as the decision not\nto hire out snake charmers and camel\ncostumes. As aforementioned this is\npartly fighting fire with fire, pitting\none bit of cultural flab with another,\nbut hopefully they'll fight it out (as flab\ntends to) into neutralisation and get us\nto see past the blubber to some kind of\ntruth beneath. One that we can all read\nwith untainted spectacles, and be that\nlittle bit more wise for it.\n*Uncle Ben/Huda\nIslamic Awareness Week runs\nfrom the 18th February with the\nExhibition in Sherfield Stairway\non the Monday and Thursday.\n(Literally) Unmissable.\nOmar Hafeez-Bore\n\n"

    "content": "12 felix Friday 8 February 2008\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPolitics\nT\nhe Imperial Political\nPhilosophy Society, on\nTuesday night, held a discussion on the Israel/Palestine conflict. They invited three guest speakers to give their\nviews and answer questions from the\naudience: Robin Kealy, former Consulate General to Jerusalem; David Newman, Professor of Political Geography\nat Ben-Gurion University; and Ghada\nKarmi, Research Fellow and lecturer at\nthe University of Exeter. Eeach spoke\nat length on this controversial conflict.\nFelix has already run articles by myself\nand others on the issue; the purpose\nof this article is to give those who did\nnot attend a feel of the interesting ideas\nput forward, and those who did attend\na chance to reflect on a fast-paced\ndiscussion.\nRobin Kealy began the proceedings\nwith some background on the negotiations that have gone on in the past and\nhis experiences as consulate general to\nJerusalem. In true diplomatic nature\nhe treated the events and issues with\ncare. At the forefront of his argument\nwas what he believed to be the barrier\nto progress in this conflict: previous\nattempts to bring the sides together\nfailed because they were not comprehensive in their scope. He highlighted\nthe Oslo Accords as a symbol of this\nproblem, and although both sides were\nbrought together in negotiations, the\nreal intractable issues, such as Jerusalem, refugees, Israeli settlements in the\narea, and security and borders were\nnot addressed. Mr. Kealy was clear\nabout how he felt successful agreements would be accomplished. Completely \u201ccomprehensive negotiations\u201d\nare absolutely indispensable because\n(a) each issue is unavoidably linked to\neach other, and (b) for negotiations to\nbe successful there must be a win-win\nsituation. Each side must believe that\nany concession \u201ccosts him less than\nwhat it\u2019s worth to the other side\u201d, or to\ndisentanglethisdiplomaticjargon,each\nside must feel the solution is fair. The\nonly way to achieve this win-win situation is by allowing each side to have\ngains on certain issues and concede on\nother issues, this successful dynamic\ncan only exist if all the issues are on the\ntable and therefore in order to get real\nprogress completely comprehensive\nnegotiations must take place.\nIn many ways Mr. Kealy talked about\nthe challenges facing diplomats rather\nthan the issues on the ground today.\nHowever, he did succinctly state the\ncentral issues. Who will control the\nborders in a possible two state solu-tion? What is a viable Palestinian state,\nand what form will it take? What will\nbecome of Jerusalem \u2013 can it be shared\nor divided? (He reminded us that the\nUN planned to make Jerusalem a corpus separatum in 1947, meaning that\nit would have been placed under effective United Nations control, a \u2018free city\u2019\nif you like.) What is the nature of the\nright of return? He did take some time\nto investigate this issue. Robin Kealy\nreminded us of the difference between\nagreements in principle and agreements that are followed by real chang-es. While the right of return may be\nagreed, this does not necessarily mean\nthat all Palestinian refugees must return to their pre-1947 settlements. As\nwith all the issues there are always other options on offer. The metaphor he\nused was to imagine you have bought\na plane ticket. It gives you the right to\ntravel on a particular flight; however,\nif the flight is overbooked, you might\nfind it more beneficial to find another\nmethod of transport. The message\nthat, I feel, Robin Kealy put forward\nwas twofold: firstly, as a former diplo-mat, that the Israelis and Palestinians\nmight not get exactly what they want,\nbut if we accept this then peace is not\nfar off; and secondly, that we shouldn\u2019t\nrush into negotiations. As he put it,\n\u201ca little pre-cooking helps when you\ncome to the dining room\u201d.\nThe lecture theatre quickly discovered that second speaker David Newman was not a fan of George Bush.\nConflict Case Study week begins\nImperial\u2019s Political Philosophy Society\u2019s Conflict Case study week begins with a talk on Israel/Palestine\nI\u2019m envious of the sardonic way he\ndismissed Bush\u2019s attempts to engineer\npeace in Israel/Palestine by mocking\nthe fact that Bush only just \u201cdiscovered\nthe Israel/Palestine conflict 7 years\ninto his presidency\u201d. Aside from this\nhumorous jibe, Mr. Newman had some\ninteresting thoughts on the conflict.\nHe quickly put forward his main two\nideas, that today in 2008 \u201cthere are no\nproblems with the details\u201d of the conflict and also that a two-state solution\nis viable. He went on to explain what\nwas the slightly confusing comment\n\u201cthere are no problems with the details\u201d. People, on both sides, have been\ndiscussing solutions for years now,\nhe told us. There are numerous solutions to each of the barriers to peace\nand they have been discussed, analysed and discussed again ad infinitum.\nCertainly one might agree; however, I\nfelt that stating that the details were\nnot a problem was too absolutist. The\nreal point of Mr. Newman\u2019s statement,\nhowever, was what he identified as the\ntrue problem facing the peace process:\nnot the details, but rather a lack of political will, guts, and charisma needed\nto make high-level negotiations begin\nand work. There is plenty of \u2018Track 2\u2019\ndiscourse between Palestinians and Israelis (Track 2 meaning academics and\nlow-level ministers) but concrete peace\nagreements are made through \u2018Track\n1\u2019 talks (Track 1 meaning leaders and\nforeign ministers). Mr. Newman drew\non a personal real-world example to\nhelp emphasize his point. The \u2018green\nline\u2019 that demarks the Israeli state from\nPalestinian territories he asserted to be\n\u2018problematic\u2019. It weaves in and out, with\nenclaves and administrative zones. He\nbelieves it to be a \u2018recipe for political\ninstability\u2019. A stable border must have\ncontiguous and compact areas of property on either side, he claimed that in\nmany \u2018Track 2\u2019 discussions between\nThe panel spoke to a packed audience in the Read lecture theatre\nKadhim Shubber\n\u201cA little pre-cooking helps\nwhen you come\nto the dining\nroom\u201d\n\u201cyou cannot\ndivide this\nterritory\u201d\nQassam rockets being made in Gaza, prior to being fired into Israel\n\n"

With greater confidence I claimed the third game 11-3 to\nconfirm the win for our team.\nIt has been a strong debut season\nfor the Imperial ladies as we recorded\nwins over Essex, King\u2019s and Brighton\nto finish 3rd in the South East division\nbehind Middlesex who have former\nIC just miss out on finals\nTable Tennis\nBUSA\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 4\nBrighton Women\u2019s 1st 0\nAnusha Seneviratne\nLithuanian International Egle Adomelyte and London Metropolitan - who\nhave Chinese International players\nincluding former World no.7 Fei Ming\nTong \u2013 and I\u2019m sure will win the team\nevent.\nUnfortunately we needed to finish in\nthe top two to qualify for the quarter-finals. Still it is a great achievement\nas we are in the strongest division in\nthe country. Yet the South West division only have 2 teams in total who\nautomatically qualify for the quarter-finals, now where is the fairness in\nthat! Hopefully a team will pull out so\nwe can qualify!\nFinally I would like to thank Nan and\nChristina for contributing to a great\nseason for our team. Lets hope we can\nimprove next year.

It permeates into\nevery aspect of modern day\nliving. Even your humble\nbreakfast is a smorgasbord\nof choice: will the nutritional\nvalues of cereal outweigh that of egg-and-toast? Or how about skipping\nbreakfast, whetting your appetite for\na hot lunch which you can enjoy in a\nmoreish way now. Ah, strategy.\nRiiiiiiiiiight.\nAs you can probably tell, this week\u2019s\noverarching theme is that of the multifaceted forms of strategy in gaming.\nRanging from the hatred of tedium\nthat sets into C&C 3 to the revered\nboardgame that is The Settlers of Catan, we explore this age-old genre that\nhas defined battlefields of yore.\nDon\u2019t get Samir wrong here: he\u2019s\nquite a robust C&C player on any field,\nbut if he says it\u2019s getting tedious then\nhe\u2019s probably right. Personally I find\nmost PC RTS\u2019 quite grating although\nI do have a soft spot for Battle for\nMiddle-Earth II, mainly because of the\nbrilliant Lord of the Rings mythos that\nprovides the singularity for the game.\nSettlers of Catan was a game we\ndiscovered quite soon after Ticket to\nRide and what a wonderful unearthing \u2018twas. Quickly replacing \u201cthe train\ngame\u201d as our corridor fave, we\u2019ve managed to get a fair few people involved\nand with good reason, as you\u2019ll find out\nsoon enough. Interestingly, the game\nembraces the concept of expansion\nwhich is something quite endemic to\ncomputer games.\nDisgaea may be roughly four years\nold but its depth of strategy and flexibility of play are still as compelling.\nTrue, graphically it hasn\u2019t aged particularly well but there\u2019s more to it than\njust that. PSP owners can take this\ngem on the go since a port \u2013 named\nDisgaea: Afternoon of Darkness \u2013 is\navailable, wherever you like to get your\ngames from.\nAlexander Stubley offers his expertise and cogent advice as we explore\nthe various strategies that have defined\nor have been defined by the RTS genre.\nFrom familiar terms such as turtling to\nmore esoteric tactics like critical mass,\nDr Stubley gives a 101 on all things that\nneed additional Pylons. Although the\nlack of rushing is a bit disappointing.\nAh, well. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be back with\nmore since there\u2019s a lot to these games\nthat I, quite frankly, don\u2019t care about.\nThis week in Byte, we have a full column dedicated to the addicting PAX\nGalaxia which is pretty much like a re-al-time version of Risk. In space. With\ncolours. And no dice rolls. Our News\nEd, Andrew, has graciously agreed to\nreview the game. By the way, it\u2019s also\nTomo\u2019s all-time favourite and if any of\nyou are reading this and want to get\nhim a birthday present this would be\nthe ideal gift.\nAs an aside: Yahtzee of Zero Punctuation fame has given in to the hoards\nand offered his messiah-like take on\nCall of Duty 4. Go watch it. Now.\nPlease don\u2019t hesitate to send in your\ncomments, critique and articles to\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis\nWeek\nThe dark hour approaches\nSettlers of Catan\nC&C gets Kaned RTS Masterclass Pt. I\nFlamebait: Nod off, C&C\nSamir Talwar realises that the Kane Edition wasn\u2019t as able as he wanted\nC\nommand and Conquer 3\n... what a beautiful game.\nAnd yet, somehow, they\ngot everything wrong.\nBefore you get around\nto forming that tried-and-tested lynch\nmob, let me explain. If you\u2019ve played\nany other Command and Conquer\ngame, you\u2019ll understand they\u2019re quite\nsimple as strategy games go. You get\nstuff, you use stuff to make other stuff\nthen you use the other stuff to kill yet\nmore stuff. Tactics usually focus on\ndoing one of these three steps faster\nthan the opposition. The beauty of the\ngame was that you could learn how to\nplay with any of the randomly-named\nfactions and have some chance of win-ning. Until C&C Generals came out,\nthe series was easy to learn and hard to\nmaster... just like it should be.\nThen they introduced that third side,\nand everything went to hell.\nAt some point, very shortly (coin-cidentally, of course) after Electronic\nArts folded Westwood Studios into\ntheir own ever-greater bosom, they\ndecided that Blizzard, best known\nnow for the soul-sucking behemoth\nWorld of Warcraft, made better strategy games, and promptly stole all their\nideas.\nWhat they didn\u2019t realise is that\nStarCraft, while one of the best games\nreleased for its time, was starting to\ndate, and that its approach to the genre\n\u2013 three factions: one for newbies, one\nfor experienced players and one for\nboth \u2013 was not what C&C fans were\nlooking for. Or it may have been... I\ndon\u2019t particularly care. Essentially,\nthey took a game that my little sister\ncould play and turned it into Generals\n2: With Even More Cataclysmic Weaponry. The aliens are overpowered, the\ngood guys are slow and while the bad\nguys are funny, one out of three ain\u2019t\nexactly a winning score.\nFor those of you that don\u2019t care about\nthis game, let me enlighten you: there\u2019s\nthe Global Defense Initiative, who\nbelieve Tiberium is bad and people\nshould stay away from it; the Brotherhood of Nod, who believe it\u2019s good and\npeople should inject themselves with\nthe stuff, and the Scrin, a race of aliens\nwho only exist because the lead designer saw Independence Day during\nhis weekend off. Nod are fast, not great\nat blowing stuff up but amazing at being blown up themselves. The Scrin\nare slower than that goddamn tortoise\n(lil\u2019 tip, Mr. Tortoise: just \u2018cos the hare\nis stupid doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not just a\nlazy sod) but after a little while, you get\naccess to the big, beefy space ships that\nblow up everything in sight. GDI are in\nthe middle... yes, they\u2019re boring and I\nrefuse to write any more about them.\nThere are good aspects to C&C 3, of\ncourse. It\u2019s stonkingly pretty, the campaign is quite fun and you start grinning like a rampant monkey on happy\npills every time you see that last futile\ndefence turret explode in a shower of\nsparks and shrapnel. However, fire up\na multiplayer game and problems hit\nyou faster than a sack full of upside-down anti-gravity boots.\nThe resources disappear far too\nquickly \u2013 despite Tiberium being described as a cancer that\u2019s close to covering the entire planet due to its rapid\ngrowth, you can completely obliterate\nthe map of the stuff in no time at all.\nI\u2019m not entirely sure how EA thought\nthis might be a good idea, as all it\u2019s effectively done is shortened the game\nlength.\nAll you can do after your funds have\nrun out is attack with the force you\nhave: on a large map with lots of Tiberium (as an aside, why exactly is a\nradioactive, poisonous crystal the resource in these games? How do you\nsell the stuff?) this can take a good half\nan hour, but fill up the map with the\nnumber of armies it\u2019s designed for and\nthe fun disappears after ten minutes.\nIt sure is gorgeous though.\nCan you catch the movie reference here? The clue is the giant frikkin\u2019 \u201claser\u201d beam\nEven on PCs, brown is the new next generation of visual artistry and resplendence; gorgeous, like my arse\n\n"

    "content": "Coming round the mountain\nAlexander Borresen reports on the Mountaineering Club\u2019s 2007/08 winter tour to Snowdonia\nT\nhe end of the term had\npassed, and on the Saturday afternoon, after a\nmildly heavy Friday, five\nof us gathered in the un-ion. Earlier that day Tim had passed his\nminibus test, which was good. It meant\nthe trip could actually go ahead. As the\nbus was loaded and we were almost\nready to go, we received a surprise call\nfrom Juha. Turns out we would be having some extra company on the trip.\nSo after a quick guidebook purchase, a\nstop at Tesco\u2019s and another call to learn\nwe would be met by four more ICMCers who were driving down from Scotland, we set on our way.\nArriving at the hut we were expecting\nto be greeted by 15 rampaging fellwan-derers, but it was empty so we carried\nour stuff out of the bus, lit the fire and\nsettled in for the night. Eventually the\nrest of the ICMC group and the fell-wanderers showed up, but there were\nonly four of them and they weren\u2019t exactly rampaging.\nThe next day, we took advantage of\nthe good weather to ascend Snowdon\nwith the sky clear and the temperature\ndipping below zero, going up via Crib\nGoch to find there was actually snow\nat the top of Snowdon this year. Returning to the bottom, we had enough\ntime for a warming hot chocolate in\nthe caf\u00e9.\nThe weather, as it turns out, would\nremain beautiful for the whole trip. It\ndid, however, remain a little cold. Yet\nafter a distinctively softcore first day,\nwe decided not to heed the advice of\nour compatriots who had gone and\nclimbed over the pass. Over some food\nand an indoor bouldering session in the\nhut, they had warned us of the extreme\ncold finger syndrome and general lack\nof warmth they had experienced. Pffff!\n\u201cNah, they\u2019re just being a bit lame\u201d, was\nthe initial thought of the rest of us so\nwe decided to proceed as planned.\nThis meant the next we got a fairly\nbright start and headed over to Idwal\nSlabs. These are North facing, a slight\noversight. So John and Kunal set off up\nin mountain boots up a fairly straightforward climb to make sure they could\ntop out the crag in time, Tim and Ari\nmade their way up a climb further right\non the slab and myself, Al and Adam\nfound a VS on the left hand corner of\nthe slab. Trickier than the other routes\nmaybe, but surely it couldn\u2019t be that\nbad. Hmmm, climbing when after a\nminute your fingers are merely hooks\nof numb, sensationless flesh is tricky.\nLooking at your hand to see if your fingers are actually on a hold, now that\u2019s\nfun. Anyway, fun as that was, we decided to make a detour onto an easier\nroute after the first pitch, and a wise\ndecision I couldn\u2019t help but think. We\ndescended as it was turning dark, but\nthere was still time for one of us to run\nnaked into the freezing lake.\nThe day had left us tired, so we decided that Tuesday called for some laid\nback bouldering. With no need to get\nup early, we had a bit of a lie in, said\ngoodbye to half our group who were\nheading back to London later that day\nand then drove to Cromlwch Boulders\non the Llanberis Pass. The walk in really killed us, as it was a whole 25 metres\nto the nearest boulder. There were a\nnumber of good little problems which\nkept us busy for the day.\nWith just one days worth of climbing\nrelated activity remaining, we headed\nfor warmer ground down in the Tremadog area. A little crag with some good\nclimbing and friendly conditions greeted us. A number of good climbs went\ndown, including an E1 for Tim, which\nincluded some good nut recovery ac-tion. The day had gone well until the\nvery end when a small accident led to\nme hobbling in pain down to the bus.\nAs we returned to the hut we remembered that earlier in the day the\nwater had not been working. Strangely,\nwhen we got back it still wasn\u2019t working and after searching for the problem\nand various calls, we discovered the\ntoilet was still working. Diverting water from the cistern allowed us to start\ncooking up some food in a somewhat\nunconventional manner.\nThat night the traditional ICMC winter tour Christmas dinner and secret\nSanta took place. Pork chops, roast veg\nand mange-tous adorned our plates,\nfollowed by some suspicious looking\napple pie and custard. Beer and strange\ngifts followed as we used up the rest of\nthe firewood and got set for heading\nback to London the day after.\n\u201cI can see my house from up here!\u201d\nGive us your best pout guys They say the air up here can make you a little crazy\nMaximum cool points\n39\nFriday 8 February 2008 felix\n\n"

He assures me\nhe doesn\u2019t swing that way but I can\u2019t\nhelp but wonder\u2026\nRaspberryRipple\nDear RaspberryRipple,\nIt\u2019s not surprising you\u2019re concerned. I\nstrongly urge you to consider dumping\nhim; otherwise the strains of \u201cWhole\nAgain\u201d may haunt you for the rest of\nyour life. Think strongly about how\nmuch you want to be with a man who\nhas seen Atomic Kitten live, which\nmight make the split easier if you are\none of those calm people who just get\nmildly irritated by crap music rather\nthan somebody who hears a single\nnote and starts polishing their knuckle\ndusters.\nNeedy xxx\nDear Needy,\nI think I\u2019ve got fleas. Every morning I\nwake up with huge bites all over me,\nand now the people on my corridor\nare complaining that it\u2019s happening to\nthem too. How can I get rid of them?\nScratchy&Co\nDear Scratchy&Co,\nEver heard the old atdage: there\u2019s no\nfleas without a cat? You\u2019ve got bed-bugs, which is far worse. Interestingly,\nbedbugs are so repulsive that at one\npoint in their evolution, the females\nall decided (en mass) \u201cNuhuh, I ain\u2019t\ntouchin\u2019 that no more,\u201d and so the males\ndecided (en mass) that rape was the\nonly way forward (or the more technical term: artificial insemination). Get\nfumigated, and in the meantime, apply\nDeathlac (available from your nearest\nchemist) liberally to your bed, pillows\nand friends.\nNeedy xxx\nIntroducing Felix\u2019s latest agony aunt, Needy McNeedy.

Pax. How do I love thee?\nLet me count the ways. Frustratingly difficult beyond im-agination, often painful to the\neyes, and devourer of my otherwise productive time. But Pax\nis a game which sticks in the\nmind like an icepick through\nyour eye.\nHow can I describe it to the\nunknowing masses? The first\nthing you will notice about Pax\nare the players. In a crowded\noffice, you will hear a scream\nfrom those who are intiated in\nthe ways of the click. The clicking that it constantly makes\nduring play is like crack for the\nears. Once you\u2019ve heard it, you\nare drawn to compulsively play\nwhenever it sounds... like a\nzombie to a brain-depository.\nThe basic premise of Pax is\ngalactic domination. The player starts the game on a single,\nor small set of stars, with a set\nnumber of ships. These stars\nare connected to other stars,\nand your ships can travel to\nthese other stars, subjugating\ntheir indigenous population\n(presumeably), and forcing\nthem to construct giant statues of yourself (in my head,\nat least). These stars all have\nspecific properties (defense\nbonus, attack bonus, production bonus, etc) and all of them\ncreate more ships. Distribute\nyour ships at the borders and\nattack the other 5 players until\nyou OWN IT ALL. Didn\u2019t I mention that you play this at high\nspeed against internet oppo-nents? Sorry. They\u2019re all amazingly good at it as well... This\nis the beauty of Pax. You can\nplay online for free, or pay $10\nto generate your own maps\nand practice offline. It\u2019s Risk in\nspace, and it\u2019s really, really ad-dictive. I\u2019m going to stop writing now, and go and play.\nAndrew Somerville\ncove s t at t e es a o e at\nre\nre\nreal\nal\nal\nally\nly\nly\nly m\nm\nm\nmus\nus\nus\nust\nt\nt\nt ap\nap\nap\nappl\npl\npl\nplau\nau\nau\nud\nd\nd\nth\nth\nth\nthes\nes\nese\ne\ne\ne br\nbr\nbr\nbril\nil\nil\nilli\nli\nli\nlian\nan\nan\nant\nt\nt\nt Ge\nGe\nGe\nGerr-r-r\nma\nma\nmans\nns\nns\nns f\nf\nfor\nor\nor\nr t\nt\nthe\nhe\nhe\nh i\ni\ni\ninc\nnc\nnc\nncep\nep\nep\nep--ti\nti\nti\nt on\non\non\no o\no\nof\nf\nf su\nsu\nsu\nuch\nch\nch\nh i\ni\nint\nnt\nn er\nr\ne --ti\nti\ni i\ni\ni k\nk d\nd\nd\nes\nesti\nti\ning\nng\nng,\n, qu\nqu\nquir\nir\nirky\nky\nky a\na\nand\nnd\nnd\nri\nri\nrigh\ngh\nghtf\ntf\ntful\nul\nul\nully\nly\nly\nly a\na\nadd\ndd\nddic\nic\nicti\nti\nting\nng\nng b\nb\nb\nboa\noa\noa\noard\nrd\nrd\nga\ngame\nme\nmes\ns\ns.

    "content": "33\nFriday 8 February 2008 felix\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk Games\nDefence is important in any strategy\ngame, some would argue almost as important as attack in fact. The basics to\ndefending your own base are to identify entrance points (sometimes with\nattached choke points), as well as noting down what forces can attack from\nangles other than the entrances (think\nair units or naval units).\nChoke points are easy enough to de-fend, as it's a simple matter of placing\nturrets and fortifications near them to\nconcentrate firepower while the enemy\nforces are channelled into that loca-tion. If the choke point is particularly\nnarrow the usage of splash damage\nweaponry can be particularly devastat-ing, even if it wouldn't be on a normal\nfield of battle.\nOther methods of entering a base depend on the game, but in general you\ncan leave them lightly defended unless\nyou know your opponent is planning to\nhit you in that manner. The final thing\nabout fortifying a base, or any other\nposition for that matter, is to know the\nsiege weaponry your opponent is likely\nto bring.\nGenerally, siege weapons are either\nincredibly effective against buildings,\nor simply outrange them in combat,\nor sometimes both. If your opponent\nis likely to use weapons shorter range\nthan your defences, simply building\nmore defences can work (a critical\nmass of turrets?) although sometimes\nit works better to mingle mobile units\namongst your defences. If your opponent is using weaponry that outranges\nyour defences, you can either keep a\nsmall, fast army around to kill off any\nlong-range hardware your opponent\nmay bring, or to simply integrate long-range siege weaponry into your own\ndefence.\nIntegrating longer range defences\ninto your fortifications brings the\nproblem that against an opponent with\nequal range you will have to place your\nlongest range gear at the front of your\nlines, which is arguably the worst place\nfor it, so if both players have access to\nthe same range siege engines then a\nmobile army is likely more effective.\nLaying Siege\nMy personal favourite form of defence\nis that of the siege. Against an opponent who bunkers himself up and tur-tles, it is a good idea to take map control and to surround his base with your\nown defences. Not only does it guarantee that none of your newer expansion\nbases will get destroyed or even har-assed, but it is also presents you with a\nsmaller surface area to defend.\nHowever, sieges are not only useful\nfor isolating your opponent in his base\nfor defensive purposes, they are incredibly useful to use as a staging point\nand a forward base of operations. Sieges not only give you the option to build\nunits in the field instead of all the way\nback at one of your main bases, but\nthe proximity of nearby base defences\nmake harassment far more risk-free as\na safe haven is always a short distance\naway.\nSieges can lastly be used to encroach\non an opponent\u2019s base by the use of\n\u201cleap-frogging\u201d, which is where you\nbuild defences closer and closer using\nthe previous line of fortifications to\ncover the ones being produced from\nyour enemy\u2019s attack. Once you and\nyour opponent\u2019s lines are just out of\nrange of each other it becomes possible to bring siege engines in for the kill,\nand if your opponent wishes to bring\nthem down they will either need their\nown siege engines or they will have to\nbreak the front rows of the siege, either\nway you will have the home ground\nadvantage.\nNotes on the Late Game\nOne final aspect that separates into\ntwo radically different gaming plans is\nthat of the extreme late game, where\none of two things occur:\n1) Games where players can build resource generators see an escalation of\nthe battles and micro takes a back seat\nas armies become larger and larger as\nplayers resource generation scales upwards until something drastic happens\nand their economy gets taken out.\n2) Resources on the map dry up and\nonce-major battles degenerate into\nminor skirmishes where macro almost\nentirely disappears as players frantically micro their remaining forces to\nmake the most of them.\nThe simple first step to stand up in\nthe late game is to know whether situation 1) or situation 2) will occur in the\ngame you are playing, which is intrinsically related to whether resources are\nlimited or whether you can produce\nyour own resources. The second step is\nto alter your playing style to make the\nmost of the situation.\nIn situation 1), economy becomes\nyour lifeline as well as it also becoming your opponents\u2019 lifeline. Due to the\nlikely abundance of resources, armies\nbecome larger and almost infinitely ex-pendableastheywillbereplacedasthey\nare lost, and the entire objective of the\ngame becomes trying to destroy your\nopponent's base and economy. Once\none player has lost their economy then\nthey lose their ability to replace forces\nlost to random throwaway armies and\nthose random clashes around the map\nbecome devastating to your opponent\nas he cannot keep up with his armies\ndestruction.\nSituation 2) causes the opposite to\nhappen, as there is no longer an economy to speak of. The rarity of resources\nmeans each loss in the field is a blow\nto a player, and the game starts to revolve around keeping each individual\nalive while trying to harass your oppo-nent's pockets of forces at little cost to\nyourself. Bases themselves start to lose\nstrategic importance as an objective as\nthey serve little purpose other than a\nmetaphorical brick wall for your opponent to waste forces trying to destroy.\nSituation 2) normally ends with one\nplayer having the last remaining forces\nto show for his micro skills, following\nwhich he will proceed to slowly and\nsystematically destroy his opponents'\nbases while trying to keep his siege engines intact.\nConclusion\nSo there are my views on general strategy in a nutshell, warped by my own\ntaste in gaming and tempered by my\nown little likings and cravings. Bear\nin mind that each game requires a different skill balance to play, and so it is\nimportant to realise when it's the time\nfor micro and when it's the time for\nmacro.\nNo matter the balance the following\nsentence will apply all the time: make\nsure you have the right units in the\nright place at the right time attacking\nthe right target, and make sure you\nhave enough of them.\nWholesale slaughter: horse carcasses for sale, going cheap at your local market; roasted for free\nThrough the fire and flames only to be swallowed, spit out and stamped on by an angry turtle\nEven the trees eat meat in Warcraft III; it\u2019s official: vegans have no place in the WoW\nYou like this one, eh, Legolas? Eh? Think you can bring this one down? Didn\u2019t think so, nyaaah!\n\n"

It would be a shame if the\nactions of a minority see booking privileges\nwithdrawn by College for the majority of\nclubs who do book rooms in the correct\nmanner.

    "content": "games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n31\nFriday 8 February 2008 felix\nGames\nOh noes. Is it can be? Gairaigo returns\nlike the proverbial Godzilla sequel: bigger and erm... bigger. Really, it\u2019s more\nof the same stuff that you all love and\nhate. Mostly a mixture, no?\nGoing with the strategic motif that\ndefines this ludological issue of the pe-riodical, we muse over one of the PlayStation 2\u2019s finest pot pourris of strat-egy, role-playing (in the typical, crazy\nJapanese way, of course) and humour.\nYes, Disgaea: Hour of Darkness forgoes poignancy (read: whiny existential angst) in favour of juvenile humour\nthat gracefully carries a sense of clever\nparody about it. Prince Laharl wakes\nup after a two-year nap only to find\nout that his dad King Krichevskoy has\npassed away. In between, the remaining denizens of the Netherworld have\nseen fit to vie for the throne. Pissed off,\nLaharl begins his own reign of terror in\na bid to fight back against the pretenders alongside his treacherous (if she\nwasn\u2019t, it wouldn\u2019t be the Netherworld,\ndammit) vassal, Etna. Despite the story\ntaking a puerile, whimsical route, it\u2019s\neasy to get sidetracked off the main\ngameplay elements and actually pay\nattention. Along the way, you\u2019ll bump\ninto a smorgasbord of personable\ncharacters ranging from the Spheniscidaen Prinnies (who suffix the word\n\u2018dood\u2019 to everything) to the constantly\nderided Mid-boss (real name: Vyers).\nWhile the predominant expositions\nare left to Laharl, Etna and a confused\nangel trainee named Flonne, these other personalities flesh out the comedy\nwith their unique antics. The writing\nmay not be particularly sharp or witty,\nit makes do with sardonic commen-tary, an overabundance of Narcissicism and some deliciously ham-fisted\nvoice-acting. And yeah, there are a lot\nof prurient jokes that\u2019ll induce childish\ngrins, groans and a mixture of both.\nThe game is visually quaint and\nthankfully the characters are animated\nwith sprites since Nippon Ichi\u2019s forays\ninto the third dimension of visuals are,\nwell, crap. These hand-drawn avatars\nmake up for it with plenty of individuality though. Musically, the game offers\na silly carnival-like atmosphere with\ntracks that will either grate or get stuck\nin your head. Or worse: do both.\nHowever, the overarching focus\nof Disgaea falls upon its abyssal, idiosyncratic gameplay elements. It\u2019s a\nself-styled turn-based Strategy RolePlaying Game that you may have experienced with the likes of Final Fantasy\nTactics or Disgaea\u2019s lesser successors.\nThe combat is conducted upon grid-based levels that allow discrete movement and attack patterns for your\ncharacters. The first step will be for\nGairaigo \u2013 Disgaea: Hour of Darkness\nyou to position your characters on the\nmap to take advantage of a variety of\nsituations. This way you can attempt\nto attack a foe\u2019s backside (deals more\ndamage) or try a pincer attack with\nmore of your party.\nOnce this positioning is done, you\nmay select your attack strategems,\nmagical tactics, et al. And voila! With\neverything ready, you finally let the\naction commence procedurally. Once\nyour turn is up, the enemy party does\nthe same and the combat continues\nthusly. Without even delving into the\nfiner nuances of the game, you can\njudge from the onset whether this\ngame will be tedious or not; some\nwill, no doubt, be turned away and\nrightfully so. For me, it was my first\ntime playing a game of this type and\nI personally found the flexibility and\ntime to consider options a blessing.\nOnce you figure out group attacks and\ncombo benefits, it\u2019s really time to look\nfurther in.\nLike some sort of comedy scene\nabout to go wrong I picked up all my\ncharacters who emerged from the portal and created a human ladder about\neight men- (and women-) high. Why?\nTo throw them, of course. Isn\u2019t it obvi-ous? I proceeded to throw groups of\ncharacters in a well-calculated series\nof manouevres that saw the last one,\nthe victor, standing dizzily in front of\na crystalline coloured-gem. Normally\nit would have taken me many turns to\nwalk up to it and all the while I would\nhave been under the influence of a\n-50% defence penalty that defined the\nglowing areas. This could all be solved\nby destroying the accursed Geo Stone\nAzfarul Islam\nGames Editor\nin front of me, but I had other plans.\nInstead, I picked it up and hurled it\ninto the yellow series of panels thereby\ncausing all squares glowing yellow to\nbe imbued with a lovely -50% defence.\nAnd hey, what do you know, all the enemies happened to be on them. Glee.\nThe introduction of throwing, Geo\nStones and Geo Panels are only part\nof this holistic experience. Other highlights involved dirty politics in the Dark\nAssembly to get certain bills passed\n(like making stuff at the Item Shop\ncheaper, which is quite awesome): one\nway to accomplish this is to keep offering tributes to the Senators. You\ncan of course, piss some of them off,\nwhich can be a Very Bad Thing\u2122 since\nthe bastards remember you. If all else\nfails, stand up for your rights (and get\nsquashed... but hey at least you tried).\nYou\u2019re even able to Transmigrate between character classes (not genders,\nsorry) to pick up different skills and\neven have little Pupils of your own that\nlevel up faster and allow you to borrow\ntheir unique abilities. Aww, they grow\nup so quickly.\nAnd... ah, forget it. It\u2019ll only ruin the\nfun and I\u2019m running out of space to\nboot; that in itself says much about the\ndepth of this game.\nSo what\u2019s really on offer? A compel-ling, emotive RPG that innovates like\nno other? No freaking way. Rather, it\u2019s\na compelling, hilarious strategy game\nthat involves you to OCD levels of\ntinkering and offers you some of the\nstrangest gameplay quirks you\u2019ll ever\nsee. Yeah, so it\u2019s an old game but this\nkind of charm is truly untarnished by\ntime.\nNo one states the blinding obvious better than our Flonne\nSpecial attacks are complemented with some snazzy effects\nCharacter recruitment\n\n"

Check out last\nweek \u2013 page one includes two tits discussing whether we\u2019d rather pay thirty\nthousand pounds this year, or in five\nyears\u2019 time. Then there\u2019s me, a self-obsessed cretin with a beret and a copy\nof A Very Short Introduction To Sounding Like A Philosophical Tit. You\u2019ve got\nMaster-of-the-Overextended-Analogy\nMr. Amit throwing another (admit-tedly loveable) literary curveball at\nyou, and Samuel Black \u2013 Captain Pseudonym who would probably marry\nhis pen name if he loved it any more,\nalthough that would merely force him\nto change his name to it, thus negating\nthe entire point of it.\nAnd Noel Forrest! Mr. Forrest of\nFelix 1393 \u2013 the doors rotate slower\nthan the Earth? Slower than the Earth,\nwhich rotates at more than nine hundred miles an hour, Mister Forrest the\nscientist? What kind of fucking irony is\nthat, exactly?\nTruthfully, I enjoy the comment sec-tion. I think of us as the Felix equivalent of Have I Got News For You \u2013 a\nfew disgruntled regulars who try to be\nquick-witted where they can, and take\nthe piss out of the guest writers where\nthey can\u2019t. But if this is your favourite\nsection of Felix, then you\u2019re wasting\nyour fucking time. All of you, in fact,\nare wasting your time. Except Ammar\nWaraich.\nThat name probably doesn\u2019t ring a\nbell, because you don\u2019t look at a writer\u2019s name all that often, and if you did\nread the articles I\u2019m about to talk about\nthen the writer\u2019s name was probably\nthe last thing you were interested in.\nHowever, if you don\u2019t regularly read\nas far back through Felix as the Travel\nSection, then I implore you to hunt\ndown the last few weeks of back copies and take it all in, because the most\ngripping journalism of Felix\u2019s year may\nhave just passed you by.\nHang on, the hyperbole machine\u2019s\njust stalled. While I try and restart it,\njust go and have a look at one of the\npast weeks. Mr. Waraich is a medical\nstudent, who took it upon himself last\nsummer to do a placement for a month\nout in rural Kenya. Far from being\nfull of white people in khaki chasing\nleopards with cameras and suchlike, it\nturns out that rural Kenya is actually\nin pretty bad shape. Not the kind of\nbad shape that you see on the news \u2013\nthere\u2019s nothing immediately awful going down out there, not some horrible\ndisaster occurring that BBC News 24\nhasn\u2019t managed to pipe into your eye-balls. It\u2019s just sitting there. Festering,\nalmost.\nIf you can choke down my Schadenfreude, I\u2019ll elaborate a little \u2013 his exploits in Kenya take him quite far afield.\nOff the beaten track lies, amongst other things, death, suffering, knife-edge\nsurvival, lack of resources, more death,\nmore suffering, and yes, it\u2019s Africa,\nwe\u2019ve all seen Live Aid, right? We don\u2019t\nneed to see another trip around that\nbig place with the trees.\nThe thing is \u2013 as with all student\njournalism \u2013 there\u2019s something different about seeing someone who\nisn\u2019t intentionally trying to publicise\nsomething, being put up against the\nreality of the thing in question. That\u2019s\nwhy Emily Wilson\u2019s critique of art in\nLondon is so frequently hilarious, and\nit\u2019s why Ammar\u2019s experience of being a doctor in Africa is so absolutely\nfresh and cutting. He tells you that he\nwas angry with people for not following what he saw to be common sense\n\u2013 only to find that it was poverty and\nexploitation that had forced them into\nsuch situations. He tells quite harrowing stories about how he failed to save\nlives by a matter of minutes.\nWe all know people who\u2019ve been on\ngap years and whatnot, and probably\nread their pisspoor attempts at chronicling it, but even the furthest journeyman did little other than lay some\nbricks on a floor or talk very loudly in\nEnglish at bemused children. Ammar\u2019s\naccount is powerful, honest to a fault,\nand illustrated by some of the finest\nimages I\u2019ve seen. I can\u2019t criticise it. I\ncan\u2019t be cynical or harsh. It\u2019s just great\njournalism, and it puts whining shits\nsuch as myself to shame.\nThis is what being a student is about\n\u2013 seeing the world with eyes that aren\u2019t\njaded by experience and bias, seeing it\nfirst-hand and relating it to others. It\nmakes me thoroughly proud to be a\nwriter, and simultaneously ashamed of\nmy incapability to match his frankness.\nAs we sail on into Valentine\u2019s Day like\nan elephant on a Hornby train at the\nedge of a rather pink minefield, clutching closer to our loved ones and cursing our inability to spend a banker\u2019s\nwage on a diamond the size of our\ngenitalia, I\u2019m not asking but demanding that you go and hunt his writing\ndown. It defines, for me at least, what\nit means to be young and free in this\nworld. Something that, by reading his\nwords, you may come to cherish even\nmore.\nA. Geek\nT\nhe recent spate of celebrity deaths is causing no\nend of concern for the average citizen. First Heath\nLedger was cruelly ripped\nfrom our bosoms and now Jeremy Beadle joins the toll. It feels like only yesterday that Richard Whiteley shuffled\noff his mortal coil. I mean who\u2019s next\n\u2013 Terry Wogan?\nIt is hard to come to terms with these\nemotional bombshells but, given time\nand the right sort of support, perhaps\na few sensitively compiled retrospec-tives, one hopes to be able to scrabble\ntogether some sort of a life without\nHeath and Jeremy.\nHowever, it is impossible to achieve\nsuch a remote objective when there is\na small but persistently vociferous minority of people who seem to think it\nvery funny when famous people bite\nthe dust.

To give\nyou an idea of exactly\nwhat it offers it combines a set of existing technologies to vastly improve\ncustomer experience in a broad range\nof locations.\nIn essence it is a a touchscreen computer that is embedded in the surface\nof the table. This alone is nothing new\nbut the features which have been attached to this interface are what really makes it shine. Using RFID ( Radio\nFrequency Identification ) the surface\ncan detect devices which have been\nlaid on it such as cameras, phones and\neven credit cards.\nA good example of the final use of\nthe system which has been demonstrated by Microsoft is a new way to\npay for meals or drinks in a restau-rant. Say at the end of a meal with a\ngroup of friends you normally have the\ntricky process of splitting the bill between you, with Surface this problem\nis eradicated. All of you put your RFID\nenabled credit/debit cards on the surface and the waiter can make the bill\npop up on the display. Each member\nof the party can then simply drag the\nitems they purchased from the bill to\ntheir card and they are then charged\nappropriately.\nA new and interesting development\nto the Surface family is the confirmation that a version designed specifically\nfor home is in the works. Some uses for\nthis are fantastic. As you may or may\nnot know the Microsoft Zune allows\npeople to share music between their\nZunes for free but the tracks delete\nthemselves after 28 days. This process of sharing is not always a very user\nfriendly experience and once again the\nSurface comes to the rescue. With your\nSurface in your living room you and\nyour accomplice can place your Zune's\non the device and then drag files back\nand forth.\nI think that if this product becomes\nmainstream in public places it could be\na big breakthrough. This level of user\nexperience has always been Apple's\nthing and realistic competition in this\nmarket could be fantastic for us as end\nusers. So Microsoft may start to make\nour lives easier for once.\nAww look at that, social computing. Why must companies fill their ads with lies\nYou must by sick of seeing this thing by now\nW\nhen my Creative\nZen, a trusty MP3\nplayer that survived more than its\nfair share of abuse,\ndied I decided to move up in the\nworld. \u00a3256 later i have my replace-ment, a shiny new 16GB iPod Touch,\nbut is it worth the money?\nAfter getting over the fact that i now\nown an Apple product I have to admit\nthat I have fallen in love with the sleek\ndesign on the iTouch. Measuring 110\nx 61.8 x 8 mm it's a thin and portable\ndevice powered by a 412 Mhz ARM\nprocessor and a large 128MB of RAM.\nIt comes with the standard iPod grime-attracting metalic back and a flat glass\nfront comprised of a 3.5\u201d screen and a\nsingle home button. Fitting perfectly\nin the palm of your hand and weighing a tiny 120g it's a highly \u201cooh, shiny\u201d\ndevice.\nIt would be easy to go on about the\ndesign of the iTouch, however there is\nso much more to this device, namely\nthe interface. The iTouch uses a multi-touch sensitive glass screen atop a gorgeous 480x320 display. With vibrant\ncolours and a high number of pixels per\ninch (163 dpi) it's incredibly sharp and\nclear. The device is perfect for video\npodcasting, able to show widescreen\nfootage without a hitch. Unfortunately\nyou are limited to Apple's favourite formats (MPEG, h.264, Quicktime Mov),\nso no native DivX support.\nApple have clearly spent a large\namount of research on the iTouch as\nthe navigation is seamless and intuitive\nwith out-of-the-box usability. The music library is fast and simple to navigate,\nwith the optional glitsy iTunes-style\ncoverflow, utilising the touch screen\nto flick through the library in a more\nnatural manner. Scrolling through\nyour music library is quick, easy and a\npleasure compared to the Zen's click-wheel interface.\nNow the iTouch is more than an MP4\nplayer due to the cloning of its close\nrelative, the iPhone. Inheriting WiFi\nconnectivity, along with the design and\ninterface, the iTouch is an amazingly\npowerful portable internet device. The\nbuilt in Safari web browser renders\npages with the iTouch's screen size in\nmind and the touch screen interface\nprovides the best web browsing experience i've used for some time. The\nonscreen keyboard is incredibly accu-rate, with dictionary based corrections\nfor typos, gestures for zooming and\nthe ability to correctly identify the link\nyou're attempting to click. However,\nwithout the iPhone's ability to use the\nmobile network, the iTouch is limited\nto internet browsing in range of a Wifi\nhotspot, although the university wireless network is a perfect substitute.\nThe iTouch packs one last punch in\nits inventory to make it a highly advanced portable media device, appli-cations. The current version in stores\n(1.1.3) comes pre-loaded with Google\nMaps, Mail, Youtube, stocks, as well as\nhaving an entire online web application\nsite. These extend the iTouch's functionality far beyond anything currently\ncompeting on the market and with the\nrelease of the SDK around the corner\n(allowing home programmers to create\ntheir own applications) the iTouch has\nlimitless potential.\nA hefty pricetag does detract from\nthe iTouch's appeal, although there is\nan 8GB version for \u00a3199 and a 32GB\nversion announced on Monday for\nthose that have a huge media collec-tion. The functionality of this device\nkeeps giving, yet it is limited when\nnot within range of a wireless access\npoint. The iTouch is perfect within the\nUniversity's free wireless network, although i would recommend potential\nbuyers to weigh up whether they will\nbe using everything the iTouch has to\noffer.\n\n"

    "content": "32 felix Friday 8 February 2008\nOne of the most enduring genres of\nPC gaming is that of the common\nRTS. Over time the skills required to\nplay competitively in these games have\nbecome as diverse as the games them-selves. Working through a web of technical terms for different play aspects\ncan be daunting, as can learning how\nmuch each type of strategy is needed\nin each individual game to achieve\nthe best balance of your brain\u2019s clock\ncycles. This brief guide should help\npeople nail down the basics required\nfor the more standard multiplayer RTS\ngames out there. While these tips are\nnot designed for squad-based strategy\ngames, turn based strategy games or\nsingle player games, some tricks might\nstill apply.\nThe largest facets of strategy which\nappear to a greater or lesser degree in\nall RTS games are those of microman-agement, macro-management and\nunit strategy. Achieving a balance of\nthese three attributes can be difficult\nin any given game due to it varying between games so greatly. More interesting however is how many of the more\ncomplicated concepts are simply a collision between two of the facets.\nMicromanagement\nFirst to be covered is the aspect of mi-cromanagement. As the name suggests\nmicromanagement (or simply micro)\nis the art of little things, attention to\ndetail. Micro can take many forms in\na game, ranging from focusing fire\non key targets in skirmishes to placing turrets in a perfect arc as to focus\nfire on a choke point to meticulously\nspreading units out to avoid splash\ndamage attacks.\nAn important thing about micro is\nthat it requires a time investment, so\nalthough it allows your forces to operate more effectively under given cir-cumstances, it can be to the detriment\nof other areas. Those who want to improve micro will do well to memorise\nthe hotkeys in the game, although having good basic control of the mouse\nwill also work wonders.\nMacromanagement\nOn the opposite end of the scale is the\nart of macro-management (or simply macro). Again opposite to micro,\nmacro is the skills of looking at the big\npicture. While micro is metaphorically\na leader in the field pointing and saying \u201cshoot that, attack its weak point\nfor massive damage!\u201d or \u201cbuild turrets\nin a perfect hyperbolic arc here\u201d, macro would be the general asking how\nmany tanks can be made in 5 minutes\nor pushing those cool coloured blocks\naround a map.\nThe largest aspect of macro in games\nis that of base building, map control\nand resource generation. Basically it is\nimportant to try to keep your empire\nat maximum efficiency, with incoming resources being maintained in an\nalmost perfect equilibrium with outgoing costs. If any imbalance in your\neconomy springs up it should be rectified immediately by either more forces,\nmore factories or simply searching out\nadditional resources.\nIn general, you should always be\nproducing forces except in the circumstance when you are not sure\nwhat your opponent has in reserves, in\nwhich case keeping some emergency\nresources on hand can allow a counter\nto be built within short order.\nUnit Strategies\nThe third major aspect in strategy\ngames is that of the unit strategy. In its\nmost basic form unit strategy takes the\nguise of what counters what in a game,\nbut it also is important for figuring out\nunit combinations.\nUnit strategy varies greatly between\ngames due to the individual units\nthemselves varying, unlike macro and\nmicro which remain almost universal between games in the RTS genre.\nThose who want to improve unit strategy in particular have two main routes\nto follow, either learn or research effective counters and combinations\nand stick by them, or alternatively one\ncould memorise a variety of the most\nimportant unit stats to allow counters\nand combinations to be thought of on\nthe fly for a particular situation.\nThose who do not play strategy\ngames often will usually find simply\nlearning various counters sufficient,\nbut those who plan to play a particular game often will find it particularly\nuseful to be able to recite various important stats about each unit. A solid\nknowledge of each unit's strengths and\nweaknesses can allow a single effective\ncounter to be found against combinations of enemy units, as well as letting\nsickeningly cost-effective combinations to be found against your opponents forces.\nBefore investing much time trying to\nlearn several tables of unit stats however it is worth checking how much unit\nstrategy affects the game you are learning to play, as depending on the game a\nsingle unit can wipe out armies, while\nin a different game the perfect counter\nmay still only be capable of fighting a\nbattle at a 2:1 efficiency.\nReconnaissance\nNow learning what counters what is\nnice and all, but it just makes it all the\nmore important to know quite what\nyou need to counter in the first place,\nas this is the place of reconnaissance in\ngames (usually just called recon). Good\nrecon in games takes quite a lot of mi-cro, but the end result is that you know\nyour opponents units and movements\nso an effective counter can be found.\nDue to micro mostly helping you find\nwhat units your opponent has, it plays\na much greater part in games with an\nemphasis on unit strategy. But as well\nas checking what your opponent has,\nrecon also plays several other roles,\nsuch as keeping your own forces safe\nfrom harassment, or highlighting important choke points on the map to be\ndefended.\nThe final thing recon does for you is\nto allow you to stifle early expansions\non your opponents\u2019 part, as they can be\ndifficult to defend and are quite an investment for your foe. But the best part\nof recon in games? It only takes time.\nGive or take a single unit all it takes is a\nbit of micromanagement on your part\nand all these benefits can be yours.\nKnowledge of your opponent\u2019s army\u2019s\nlocation can allow easy harassment of\neverything he/she owns that isn't right\nnext to his/her forces. A vigilant player\ncan easily make quick attacks followed\nby equally quick retreats to chip away\nat the opponent's bases or pockets of\nsupporting forces with little to no cost\nto his own economy. In addition to the\nslow wearing down of your opponents\nsupporting forces, harassment is also\npsychological attack where your opponent may become excessively defensive to try to stop your attacks if you\nare lucky, or might try a rash attack\nwith his current army to try to end the\ngame before he takes too many losses\nwhich may or may not be to your ben-efit. Building a suitably mobile group\nof units with which to harass your opponents can seem like quite an invest-ment, but remember that those units\ncan regroup with your main army\nquickly if needed and offer much-needed support.\nCritical Mass\nA little trick that only appears in certain strategy games is that of the critical mass. Certain units in certain games\nThe Player\u2019s Guide to Real Time Strategies\nAlex Stubley have to be treated differently when in\nvery large numbers. Typically the units\nthat critical mass are long-range, sometimes with associated splash damage,\nand usually rather fragile.\nCounters to an individual unit will\neither not work against the critical\nmass, or sometimes will work even\nmore effectively against the mass than\nthe individual.\nCounters of the former kind are usually due to having shorter ranges than\nthe mass (less ranks firing at once, or\nsimply dying before getting in range\ndue to sheer volume of fire), while the\nlatter counters are due to either some\nsort of immunity against the mass or\nsimply because they command a splash\ndamage attack. This dividing of the\ncounters can usually be figured out\nby remembering unit stats, saving the\nnumber-centric players much hassle\nwhen it comes to defeating an oppo-nent's force.\nCritical massing is often used late-game to help cover weaknesses in larger armies, as a mass usually only relies\non small amounts of support to keep\nparticularly nasty counters away, while\nthe other half of the counters are rendered less effective due to the massed\nfirepower. Fighting against a mass that\nuses support is a matter of either finding a counter that neither the mass can\nbeat nor the support, or using micro to\neliminate the support with lightning-fast strikes followed by a crushing attack using all of the counters for the\nmass itself.\nMass on mass combat, however, is often determined by sheer numbers and\nmonetary investment, although sometimes one mass might be more \u201cmassable\u201d thereby giving the advantage,\nso it can be important to learn which\nmass beats which mass. In general the\n\u201cmassability\u201d of a unit is proportional\nto its range divided by its size, as they\nare the two factors that decide how\nmuch withering fire it can hail down\non anything that opposes it.\nTurtling\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGames\n\n"

Ghada\nKarmi categorically stated that there\ncould not be a fair, just solution to this\nconflict as long as Israel continued to\nbe a politically Zionist state because it\nwould continue to act according to this\nideology which is discriminatory and\nunstable.\nShe then moved on to address the\nissue of a two-state solution versus a\none-state solution. During his talk,\npoint, as \u201ceasy to understand and inevitable\u201d. Political Zionism requires a Jewish state which is either entirely Jewish\nor has a large Jewish majority so that it\nis for all intents and purposes entirely\nJewish. When the Zionist movment\nchose Palestine as their homeland, they\nencountered a problem in that there\nwere already Palestinians in residence\nthere. In order to maintain a Jewish\nmajority, these Palestinians had to be\nexpelled, removed from Jewish territories \u2013 otherwise there would not be a\nJewish majority. In addition the Israeli\nstate must ensure that these Palestinians do not return as again this would\ndamage the Jewish majority. Therefore\nthe \u2018right of return\u2019 is a non-question,\nand Israel, under a Zionist ideology\ncannot accept the return of Palestinians either in principle or reality as it\nwould contradict this Zionist ideology.\nBy understanding this cause of the con-politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nFriday 8 February 2008 felix\nPolitics\nA bigger stage for your talents\nPut your career \ufb01rst by joining KPMG. With specialist training and graduate opportunities\nacross Europe, you\u2019ll have the chance to shine in a role that\u2019s right for you.\nFind out more at kpmgcareers.co.uk/biggerstage\n\u00a9 2008 KPMG LLP, a UK limited liability partnership, is a subsidiary of KPMG Europe LLP and a member \ufb01rm\nof the KPMG network of independent member \ufb01rms af\ufb01liated with KPMG International, a Swiss cooperative.\nIsraeli and Palestinian cartographers\nthe issue of the West Bank border had\nbeen hammered out. If there were real,\nbilateral \u2018Track 1\u2019 discussions, this\nproblem could be solved; in essence,\nthe details were not the problem.\nOn the issue of the two-state solu-tion, David Newman believed this to be\nviable in part due to its acceptability to\nthe Israeli public. He rejected the one-state solution, a standpoint that was\ncompletely at odds with Ghada Karmi\u2019s\nviews as you will see later. There is a\nconsensus amongst the Israeli public\nthat the two-state solution is what a realistic peace will look like. As evidence,\nNewman pointed to the fact that two\nright-wing Israeli politicians \u2013 Ehud\nOlmert and Ariel Sharon \u2013 ran an election campaign and won with a policy\nthat was, in Israeli politics, a radical\nleft position. The reason for this was\nnot because the right wing suddenly\nchanged its ideology but rather it recognised the consensus amongst Israelis that a two-state solution is the only\nviable solution. Throughout his talk,\nthere was an undercurrent of reality\nthat reassured me. Mr. Newman was\nwell aware of the large role played by\ndomestic opinion and admitted that\nthis posed significant barriers. He reminded us \u201cthe level of mutual mistrust and suspicion [between Israelis\nand Palestinians] is greater than it was\n10 years ago\u201d.\nFinally speaking was Ghada Karmi.\nHer style was much different to the\nother speakers. To some it must have\ncame across as confrontational while\nothers will have viewed it as passion-ate; regardless. her message and logic\ncame out clearly. She first took time to\nexplain that she disagreed completely\nwith David Newman. She explained\nthat the flaw in his viewpoint was that\nhe assumed equivalence between the\nPalestinians and Israelis. She described\nthe conflict as colonial and stated that\n\u2018conflict resolution\u2019, as Mr. Newman\nput it, was impossible between an oc-cupier and the occupied. Because the\nstronger power will always have the\nupper hand, any negotiations will inevitably favour him and therefore any\nagreement will not be satisfactory to\nthe weaker power; a conflict resolution\nas a result cannot be stable or \u2018fair\u2019. The\nmain focus of her argument was that to\nachieve a peaceful future, we must fully\nunderstand the origins of the conflict.\nThe origin of the conflict was, as she\nidentified, Zionism. She described the\nconflict, once you begin at this starting\n\u201cThere are no\nproblems with\nthe details\u201d\n\u201cIf you want\nsecurity, you\nwon\u2019t get it by\nkilling people\u201d\nPalestinians pray in front of the Israeli separation barrier at Kalandia checkpoint near the entrance of the West Bank city of Ramallah\nDavid Newman asked how one would\ndivide a piece of real estate between\ntwo contesting peoples. Ghada Karim\nseized upon this to state that categorically \u201cyou can\u2019t divide this territory\u201d.\nShe spoke about \u2018fairness\u2019: a two-state\nsolution can exist but it will not be fair\nto the Palestinians. Even at its best,\nwhere Israel would return to pre-1967\nborders, the Palestinian territory would\nconstitute around 20% of Palestine and\nthis is unfair. She then addressed the\nquestion of why the Palestinians put\nforward the two-state solution if it is\nso unfair. The Palestinian leadership\nin the past and in the present realized\nthat its position was so weak that to\navoid total destruction, it would have\nto accept whatever it could get in order to survive. However, even the one-state solution, she admitted, will not\nwork. There cannot be any peace in\nany form, she re-iterated, until Israel\nabandons political Zionism. She ended\nher talk with an emotive appeal to the\naudience. She urged us to forget high\nand mighty talk about high level negotiations and remember the reality on\nthe ground. Remember that the West\nBank is \u201cdivided into ghettos, barriers,\nand checkpoints\u201d, that \u201cGaza is a giant\nprison, sealed off, surrounded\u201d. And\n\u201cIsrael\u2019s creeping colonization has rendered the two-state solution impossible\u201d. In a direct message to Israel she\nstated that \u201cif you want security, you\nwon\u2019t get it by killing people\u201d.\nIf you feel that I have misrepresented\nany of the views put forward at the\nevent, I sincerely apologise. After the\nevent I, and I hope others too, feel\nmore informed and more confidant\nabout tackling this issue in future. I\u2019m\nlooking forward to the next event on\nThursday which focuses on the conflict in Kashmir.\n\n"

There must be a\nbalance between the things we have to\ndo and our own happiness, as one cannot be fulfilled adequately without the\nother.\nOld age, for the undergraduates at\nleast, is many decades away, but we\ncan apply Joseph\u2019s logic to our younger\nyears and make sure our youth is not\n\u201csober\u201d as hers was and to pay no heed\nto the ways in which society expects us\nto operate.\nGo on, try wearing horrible shirts\nand hoarding things in boxes: you\u2019ll\nfeel much better for it, I\u2019m sure!\nThe Girl in the Red Hat by Vermeer\nDygood, dybbad and dyugly: Dy Dybbuk review\nCaz Knight celebrates wearing horrible shirts and growing older with a poem from Jenny Joseph\nFilm Editor Alex Casey swaps actors for players and heads to the King\u2019s Head theatre to catch a production\nWhen I Am Old\nFriday 8 February 2008 felix 21\nI\nnspired by his own experience\ntravelling between Russian and\nUkranian Jewish shtetls, S. Ansky wrote The Dybbuk in 1917\nand created what is long considered a seminal work in Jewish thea-tre. Centred on the age-old theatrical\nthemes of love and betrayal, it places\nthem in a small community inspired\nby the folk tales that Ansky discovered\non his travels. Now being staged in the\nKing\u2019s Head Theatre, Islington, The\nDybbuk has been brought resurrected\nin a production that is as possessing in\nexperience as it is in theme.\nThe main hilt of the story is the love\nbetween the almost destitute Chonen\nand the beautiful Leah, the latter of\nwhich is destined to be married once\nher wealthy father has chosen a viable\nsuitor. As Chonen\u2019s all-consuming love\ncauses him to question and explore the\nboundaries of his faith, he unravels as\na husband is found for Leah, dying of\ngrief. In death he becomes a Dybbuk, a\nspirit capable of possessing the body of\nany creature and soon seizes control of\nhis beloved to expose what kept them\napart in life.\nA brief synopsis of the story does\nnot do justice to the script, constituting of a delightful blend of philosophy\nand social commentary with some intriguing emotional imagery delivered\ndeftly by a skilled cast. As the lovers\nof the piece, Edward Hogg as Chonen\nand Hanne Steen as Leah excel, the\nformer conjuring a tortured soul with\nan incredible intellect trying to evoke\nthe true power of scripture surrounded\nby others who simply practise as habit,\nand the latter as the enchanting beauty\nwho beguiles him.\nThe cast equip themselves well with\nthe exception of Chris Courtenay as\nLeah\u2019s father who is miscast in the role,\nappearing too much like a comedic fool\nto be believable as an unscrupulous foil\nto the lovers\u2019 plan. David Meyer\u2019s turn\nas the Rabbi Azriel called in to exorcise the Dybbuk manages to remain on\nthe right side of hammy for the most\npart whilst Tam Williams\u2019 Messenger\nconveys the correct spooky quality demanded of the role, if perhaps a little\ntoo much by the end.\nThe staging of The Dybbuk however\nis its greatest achievement alongside\nthe lead performances. From the opening scene, the intimacy of the rather\nsmalltheatrelendsitselfperfectlytothe\nstory and the director has employed it\nto full effect. More than anything, the\ningenuity with which the possession of\nLeah was choreographed is wonderfully successful and any scenes without\nthe pair can seem drawn out by their\nabsence. Despite a slow down in the\npace of the play towards the end, complete with some revelations of dubious\ncredence, there is a good attempt to\nhold the interest of the audience even if\nit doesn\u2019t maintain the visceral appeal\nof Leah and Chonen\u2019s scenes.\nThe Dybbuk is by no means treading\nold ground despite its central themes.\nWith its top notch cast and a vitality\nseldom matched in larger productions,\nit is nothing less than enchanting. Edward Hogg as The Dybbuk, Chonen\nHey! Quickly! Pull her finger! There\u2019s not a moment to lose\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Arts\n\n"

Their onslaught created a couple of chances but Vivian collected the\nball easily on all accounts, helped by\na makeshift backline of Emma, Yoke,\nLaura and Cheryl. IC began to push\nback with Dehydys and Rita leading the\ncharge in midfield. Barbara and Steph\nprovided width down the sides and\nwith Chin and Pav upfront it looked as\nif IC were due a goal any time. However, RUMS played in a Spartan-like\nphalanx with the entire team charging\nafter whichever IC player had the ball.\nWhile IC was having a frustrating first\nhalf, the referee was having a busy one,\ncalling offences against various hair-clips and bobby pins. He stopped play\na couple of times and requested various IC players to take out the felonious\nhair accessories, finally announcing\nthe next player found with a hair clip\nwould be given a yellow card.\nThe second half started and IC won\nan early corner this time around.\nChances bountiful but still the ball refused to go into the back of the RUMS\nnet. RUMS had a few breaks but were\nunable to get past the IC backline. IC\nfinally took the lead fifteen minutes\ninto the second half.\nThey had won a corner which Rita\ntook, passing it short to Laura who\npassed it back to Rita who, from the\nedge of the box on the backline, hit a\nstunner of a strike into the back of the\nnet from an angle that can only be described as near zero. Karen came on in\nBarbara\u2019s place to help IC defend their\nslender lead to prevent the match from\ngoing into extra time (else they pay the\ntaxi driver a small fortune for waiting).\nIC are through to the quarter finals to\nface UCL in the Women\u2019s Challenge\nCup.\nWednesday came around and saw\nIC taking seven lovely ladies down to\nPortsmouth to play the last match of\nthe BUSA league season. With Queen\nMary sitting comfortable at the top of\nthe league, IC was in battle with the\nUniversity of Portsmouth and Brunel\nfor second place, who were just a point\neach behind. Morale was running low\nuntil the IC players were told that\nPortsmouth could only field ten players themselves. Fuelled by a desperate\nhope, IC played a 3-3 formation (true\nstory) with one attacker and five natural defenders. Needless to say it was a\nvery defensive match.\nIt started off with Steph taking the\nball down the right wing but she went\ndown to the ground after a Portsmouth\nplayer five times her size gave her a\nhefty shove. Unfortunately, no free\nkick was given but Steph ended up getting her beef on. Skipper Emma and\nPav dribbled past the Portsmouth players effortlessly but due to the lack of\nstrikers up front, and the fact that the\nPortsmouth goalie was almost as good\nas Emily (IC goalie), chances were dif-ficult. Laura, Kate and Cheryl held the\nline in the back, closing down plays\nPortsmouth tried to set up. It turned\nout to be easier than expected when\ntrying to mark two opposition players\nsimultaneously.\nAfter a string of IC attacks, painful\ntackles and Portsmouth ballerina-like\nfoul throw-ins, Portsmouth had their\nchance as Emily was taken down and\npanic and confusion was widespread in\nthe IC box. They did however, fluff it,\nand Kate and Laura threw themselves\nin the melee and managed to clear it. A\nminute from full time, IC had their best\nOutnumbered ladies perform in cup and league\nFootball\nULU\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 1\nRUMS Women\u2019s 1st 0\nFootball\nBUSA\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 0\nPortsmuth Women\u2019s 2nds 0\nCheryl See\nIC ladies after their win against RUMS in the Women\u2019s Challenge Cup\nThe Imperial Medics 1st XV achieved\na miraculous victory over high-flying\nSwansea University, keeping hopes\nalive of surviving for another year in\nBUSA Prem B. A squad of just 17 players (including two debutants and seven\nfreshers) embarked on the four hour\ncoach journey down to South Wales,\nknowing that it would take a mighty\nperformance to beat a Swansea that\nhad run away 47-21 winners in the previous fixture between these two sides\nin October.\nArriving late, the Medics had just 30\nminutes on the pitch to warm up and\nshake off the long drive. On a clear\nbut blustery day, both sides started\nthe game cautiously, with tactical\nkicking featuring heavily in the opening exchanges. The medics, led from\nthe front by stand-in captain Austin\nDekker, grew in confidence as the first\nhalf developed, attacking with pace and\npower, getting wide in ever-increasing\nnumbers.\nThe Swansea backs, slick and skil-ful, also posed a regular threat, but\nfantastic cover defence from both\nsides kept the scores level until the\nhalf hour mark. Back-row cum centre\nchance; Emma took the ball from the\nIC half down the left wing all the way\ninto the Portsmouth box on her own.\nThe Portsmouth goalie slipped and\nwas on the ground leaving their goal\nwide open this time. Emma crossed it\nin across the face of the empty goal, but\nPav was unfortunately unable to reach\nit in time.\nIC ended the match on a high because Brunel had lost their deciding match and so IC Women\u2019s finish\nsecond in their BUSA league, and are\nthrough to the play in the plate!\nRugby Medicals live to fight another day\nRugby Union\nBUSA\nSwansea Men\u2019s 1st 7\nImperial Medicals 1st 10\nCameron Sullivan\nCraig Nightingale made a superb initial break into the Swansea 22, with the\nMedic forwards working hard to win\nquick ruck ball, allowing mercurial fly-half Dan Neville to slip a pass to lock\nRob Anderson to crash over from close\nrange. Neville converted to give the\nMedics a 7-0 lead, which they held at\nthe half.\nIn the second period, Swansea came\nout flying, playing an attractive brand\nof expansive rugby, looking to score\nfrom every possession. But the Medics\ntackling was equal to it, and forced the\nopposition into several key turnovers\nas they became increasingly impatient.\nFly-half Neville kicked a simple\npenalty to extend the lead to 10, after\ngood work by the Medics backs forced\nSwansea onto the back foot. With a full\nhalf hour remaining, Swansea began to\nintroduce several substitutes, adding\nsize and experience in their front row.\nAt this point, the home side began to\nexert their dominance at the set-piece,\nallowing plenty of clean ball for their\ndangerous backs. Wave after wave of\nthe Swansea attack was contained due\nto more impressive defence from the\nvisiting Medics. Freshers Steve Jordan, Ed Pickles and Matt Sarvesvaran\nracked up an impressive tackle count\nbetween them, while the rest of the\npack worked tirelessly to repel the marauding Welshmen.\nThe Medics kept Swansea scoreless\nuntil the 71st minute, when sustained\npressure and quick handling led to a\ntry out wide, expertly converted from\nthe touchline by the Swansea fly-half.\nThe final nine minutes were brutal,\nas the Medics fought to protect their\nline, barely escaping their half for the\nremainder of the game. The referees\nwhistle was a welcome relief, with\nthe Medics holding out for a tense\n10-7 victory. A remarkable performance from the Medics, and a vital win\nagainst a very strong Swansea side, who\nplayed with great endeavour, but were\nguilty of sloppy finishing at key mo-ments. Victorious, the Medics players\ndescended on the hallowed Reynold\u2019s\nBar in Hammersmith to celebrate defeating the Welsh on their own turf.\nThis result places the Medics in a good\nposition for their final three BUSA bat-tles, with survival now one step closer.\nThe medics backs looking somewhat relaxed\n\n"

A month and a half off over the\nChristmas period was clearly evident\nas some of the sparkle had clearly disappeared for Imperial and Portsmouth\nwere more than ready to pounce on\nthis window of opportunity.\nPlaying a very physical and forward\n-oriented game, Portsmouth continued\nthe onslaught, consistently penetrating the edges of the rucks and mauls\nbefore off-loading to their large centres who tried to break the line. Some\ngreat defence by Imperial was the only\nthing that stopped any tries from being\nscored. But as already mentioned, the\nChristmas break was evident as small\nmistakes were being made all over the\npitch. At times, Imperial started to run\nlike crabs and failed to push forward,\nwhich resulted in some shoddy passing and poor attacking decisions. Even\nthe line-outs, which had been a strong\npoint, were suffering. Portsmouth\neventually got a penalty within kicking\ndistance and made Imperial pay by taking a slender 3 - 0 lead.\nIt was Imperial\u2019s counter-attacking\n1st XV fight for\nwin over Pompey\nRugby\nBUSA\nPortsmouth Men\u2019s 1st 3\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 6\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nSports Editor\nthat was the most impressive, with\nthe greatest play coming from Max\nJoachim and Edward Spofforth-Jones\non the wing. Imperial managed to\ngain 40 metres with superb interplay\nbetween Joachim and the captain Andrew Jasudasen, before the Portsmouth\nsecond row decided to put in a late\nhigh tackle on centre Dan Godfrey and\nrightly earned himself 10 minutes in\nthe sin-bin. Even with this advantage,\nImperial were unable to optimise and\nwere trailing 3 - 0 by half time.\nAfter some stern words from the\ncaptain and the coach, Imperial went\ninto the second half determined to turn\nthe deficit. With a more structured attack now showing, Imperial slowly\nmade their way towards the Pompey\ntry line, however persistent high tackles and hands in rucks broke the play\nand Imperial were eventually awarded\nwith a penalty in front of the posts that\nhooker Alexander Johnstone comfortably converted.\nPortsmouth, having conceded their\nfirst points at home this season, and\nalso having their sin-binned player\nreturned to them, picked up the aggression in a more controlled manor.\nThe Pompey forwards increased the\npick and drive around the edges of the\nrucks, but the Imperial forwards were\nmore than ready for them and only\ngave away inches at a time. When this\nfailed, they tried a catch and drive from\nthe line-outs, which the forwards were\nagain able to contain. Eventually, Imperial were awarded another penalty\nthat Johnstone converted and Imperial\nwere finally in the lead, a lead that was\nheavily defended until the dying sec-onds, with Rob Phillips even receiving\na yellow card in the last minute for his\nefforts.\nA groggy start to the new term for\nImperial, but there are signs of great\nthings to come, and this will hopefully\nimprove for next weeks game against\nRUMS.\nRowing demands high levels of both\nendurance and power being produced\nfrom nearly every main muscle in the\nbody. So what we eat when we are\ngoing to row has a big impact on our\nperformance. Lets go into a bit more\ndepth about it.\nThe energy demands of a rower are\nhigh, so the number of meals you will\nneed in order to consume the amount\nof calories your body needs for recovery and repair should be between 4 and\n6. If you have the typical \u201cLondon diet\u201d\nas I call it (no breakfast, a sandwich at\nlunch, a mound of food for dinner and\nthe usual chocolates or crisps while\nwatching Eastenders/Corrie), you\u2019ll\nprobably find that getting your boat\nout to water is hard going let alone\nthe seemingly endless amount of work\nthat\u2019s done on the Concept 2 rower!\nTypically, a rower will have much\nhigher energy demands than someone\nwhoisn\u2019texercising.Theywillneedcarbohydrates in particular, which should\naccount for 55-65% of the overall calories taken in. So if we take a rower who\nneeds 2900 calories a day, between\nNutrition for rowers and high energy demands\nBen Richens\nEnergia Fitness Instructor\nThe rowers and their high energy demands\n1600 and 1900 of these calories should\nbe from sources of carbohydrate (the\nrest coming from a mixture of fat and\nprotein) spread throughout the day\nover about 4-6 smaller meals rather\nthan trying to cram all those calories\nin at dinner!\nDifferences in how many calories\nsomeone needs a day depends on\nmany factors: such as gender, amount\nof lean muscle, activity level and so on.\nSo if you are in any doubt please talk\nto a member of the Ethos gym team\nwho can give you some more specific\nadvice.\nBefore\nIf you train first thing in the morning,\nhaving something to eat beforehand is\nimportant but the amount and timing\nof when you eat is a very important fac-tor; otherwise you could end up \u201cdoing\na Radcliffe\u201d and having an impromptu\ntoilet break off the side of the boat!\nThe speed at which we digest food\nwill differ for everyone, so the main\nthing is to find out what works for you\nand stick to it! A good guide is eating 30-45 minutes before you train.\nTry something which isn\u2019t going to\nbe too \u201cheavy\u201d , e.g. fruit, yoghurt or\nnuts/seeds or if you have a bit more\ntime choose something with a higher\namount of calories from carbohydrates\nas it will give your body more \u201cfuel\u201d to\nburn during your session. Good examples of this are wholegrain bread with\na healthy filling: again, the best option\nbeing something you eat regularly (the\nmeal before a race isn\u2019t the time to try\nout the spicy curry your housemate\nhas just made!).\nDuring\nMost people prefer to drink water\nduring training but with intense ses-sions, or those lasting over 45 minutes,\nsports drinks or juices are a good idea\nas this will not only re-hydrate you but\nwill also give your body additional carbohydrate and electrolytes which are\nlost during exercise. You can make you\nrown sports drink by filling up a 1.5 litre bottle with water, adding a pinch of\nsalt and some juice concentrate - about\na cup will do you if don\u2019t want it to be\ntoo concentrated.\nAfter\nThis is quite often the most overlooked\naspect, but definitely one which needs\nto be examined to promote optimal\nrefuelling and recovery. After train-ing, the sooner you can eat the better.\nCarbohydrates will make up a significant part of the meal but protein has\nto be included as this crucial for repair\nof the lean muscle that\u2019s been working\nso hard!\nA good guide to selecting carbohydrates is something that has either\ngrown from the ground or from a tree\n(vegetables, cereals or grains) and with\nyour selection of protein something\nthat once had two eyes and could either\nwalk, fly or swim (poultry, beef etc) the\nless processed food you have the better\nand that means if you can\u2019t pronounce\nthe ingredients, don\u2019t eat it!\nEngland Saxons comes to IC\nfor pre-Italy training\nThe England Saxons rugby team, otherwise known as the England \u2018A\u2019 team\ncame to Harlington on Tuesday for a\ntraining session before Saturday\u2019s 2008\nSix Nations game against Italy \u2018A\u2019 in Ragusa, Sicily. As a treat, 8 members of\nthe Imperial College Rugby Club were\ninvited along to take part in the training session.\nInitial the \u2018luck\u2019 8 thought they would\neffectively be used as human tackle\nbags in an effort to improve the Saxons defensive play, and this proved to\nbe the case. The Imperial players were\ntold to attack the England team, attempt to disrupt the ball and generally\nbe a nuisance where possible. Eager to\nimpress, the 8 players did exactly that\nand in the process got valuable first\nhand experience of what top level rugby is actually like.\nThe training session wasn\u2019t without\nit\u2019s share of fun and games, the Saxons\u2019 forwards managed to persuade IC\nflanker James Petit to hide the scrum-halfs hat, before he was politely asked\nto return it by said scum-half. IC centre Alex Fergusson, however, gave the\nbest quote of the day, claiming that\ntwo years ago he could have out sprinted any of the players that were at the\ntraining session; a view that the Saxons\nteam undoubtedly didn\u2019t share.\n1st XV captain Andrew Jasudasen\ncommented that: \u201cAfter hearing of our\nphenomenal season so far, the Saxons\ncoach Steve Bates thought that this was\nan opportune moment to inject fresh\nblood into the England squad! But on\na serious note, it was a win\u2013win situation where our boys got to experience\nsomething new and a standard of play\nto which we should be aiming for.\u201d\nOn behalf of the Imperial College\nRugby Club, this reporter would like\nto thank the England Saxons for this\nopportunity.\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nSports Editor\nBreakfast time!

Mr Ahmad was originally arrested under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security (2001) act and\nlater accused of running terrorist supporting websites and raising money for\nterrorist groups. He was subsequently\nreleased without charge after six days,\nbut in August 2004 he was arrested\nagain on an Extradition Warrant issued\nby the United States and has remained\nin prison since.\nMr Ahmad is still being held in\nWoodhill Prison where Tooting MP\nSadiq Khan visited him in 2005 and\n2006during which the bugging took\nplace. Since his second imprisonment,\nMr Ahmad has attempted to have his\nextradition appeal heard in court on a\nnumber of occasions. In June 2007 the\nHouse of Lords refused to give him a\nhearing, however, Mr Ahmad\u2019s lawyers\napproached the European Court of\nHuman Rights to see whether it would\nhear an appeal. They are currently\nwaiting to hear its decision; should the\nappeal be rejected Mr Ahmad will almost certainly be extradited to the US.\nMr Khan has a background in civil\nliberties law and is believed to have\nvisited Mr Ahmad to find out how\nhis extradition appeals were proceed-ing. Voice recording bugs were hidden\nwithin a table during the meetings.\nMPs are protected by law from bug-ging, whilst supporters of Mr Ahmad\nsee it as another infringement of his\ncivil rights. Felix spoke to ex-Imperial\nCollege Union Councillor Kareem Osman, who protested the treatment of\nMr Ahmad at the time of his arrest in\n2004. Mr Osman felt that the bugging\nwas \u201coutrageous ... because Mr Ahmad\nhas already wasted four years of his\nlife in prison\u201d and that not being able\nto communicate with his MP in confidence \u201clike you would your lawyer or\ndoctor was a further infringment on\nhis rights.\u201d\nInitial reports were hazy, but over\nthe course of this week it has emerged\nthat a Thames Valley Police officer was\nresponsible for bugging the meetings\nafter he claimed he was pressurised\nby the Metropolitan Police. When\ncontacted by Felix, the Metropolitan\nPolice declined to comment, saying\n\u201cwe do not discuss matters of national\nsecurity.\u201d Scotland Yard has cast doubt\nover the legitimacy of the Metropolitan Police\u2019s actions, saying that the\nonly appropriate circumstances for\nbugging an MP is when they are suspected of \u201cbeing involved in some sort\nof conspiracy.\u201d\nJustice Secretary Jack Straw has\nlaunched an enquiry into the bugging\nevents, which Mr Khan stated he was\npleased about, however as tensions\nrise in Parliament Mr Ahmad remains\nforgotten in all of this, with his situation unchanged and a 50-year sentence\nin a US prison a realistic possibility\neven after the UK originally released\nhim without charge.\nStudents pictured protesting the extradition of Babar Ahmad to the US\non the front page of Felix in November 2005\nAccusations and conflict over forum\nHigh profile panel attracts international debate: Political Philosophy Society caught in no man\u2019s land\nControversy in the international press\nsurrounding an Imperial event has led\nto accusations of bias in the event or-ganisers, suppression of free speech,\nand \u201cbowing to Israeli pressure,\u201d after\nDr Azzam Tamimi, one of the speakers\noriginally invited to participate, was\nasked not to attend after it was alleged\nthat he supports suicide bombing.\nThe row centres around the first\nevent in ICU Political Philosophy Society\u2019s (PPS) inaugural \u2018Conflict Case\nStudy Week\u2019 on the topic \u2018Israel/Palestine.\u2019 The week is designed to examine\nthe core themes and events of a series\nof conflicts from around the world,\ninviting high-profile speakers on each\nside to put forward their perspective\non the conflict.\nThe furore raised the tensions at the\ndebate to such a level that mass protest\nwas feared, security was heightened,\nand several members of the audience\nvocalised their offence, one member of\nthe PPS was even angry enough to also\nvoice support of suicide bombing.\nThe original speakers invited to the\n\u2018Israel/Palestine\u2019 forum were Robin\nKealy (former UK Consul-General\nin Jerusalem), Prof David Newman\n(professor of political geography at\nBen-Gurion University and prominent\nspeaker advocating progressive Israeli\npolicy), Dr Azzam Tamimi (direc-tor of the Institute of Islamic Political\nThought in London and Hamas sup-porter) and chaired by Greg Artus.\nOn Friday, footage was brought to\nthe attention of Prof Newman by a\njournalist showing Dr Tamimi on the\nBBC\u2019s Hardtalk programme, and on an\nIranian TV station. In these videos Dr\nTamimi appeared to voice his support\nand admiration of suicide bombers:\nstating that martyrdom was \u201cglorious\nand honourable,\u201d and in response to\na question on suicide bombing: \u201cYou\nsee sacrificing myself for Palestine is a\nnoble cause. It is the straight way to\npleasing my God and I would do it if I\nhad the opportunity.\u201d\nAndrew Somerville\nDeputy & News Editor\nThe panel, from left to right: Ghada Karmi, Greg Artus, Robin Kealy and David Newman\nRegarding the launch event in our \u2018Conflict Case Study Week\u2019 entitled \u2018Israel/Palestine\u2019, the panel was not as it was originally advertised\nand Dr Azzam Tamimi was replaced by Ghada Karmi. This change\nin speakers took place to carry on with the event as we originally\nintended it to be, where representatives from all countries would be\npresent, which would not have been possible with the original panel\ndue to some irresolvable differences.\nThe sad fact is that some inaccurate and hasty reporting from the\nJerusalem Post made the situation worse in what we feel was an attempt to malign the reputation of our society, our university, and all\nspeakers involved. We would like to protest such poor journalism and\nwill do what it takes to clear our name.\nWe have also received criticism about limiting freedom of expression and being sensitive to external influence. To that effect, we would\nlike to make it known that an offer to appear at a debate in the near\nfuture has been made to Dr Tamimi and he has accepted.\nThe Imperial College Union Political Philosophy Society reserves\nthe right to call upon any speaker it chooses to in its endeavor to\npromote a fair and free exchange of dialogue and ideas.\nICU Political Philosophy Society:\nOfficial statement by Ammar Waraich\nFollowing this discovery, Prof Newman contacted the event organiser\nAmmar Waraich and said that he could\nnot share a platform with a man \u201con either side of the political debate\u201d who\n\u201cpromotes the use of violence,\u201d and\nwithdrew from the debate.\nDr Tamimi\u2019s comments were previously unknown to the PPS event organisers and, wishing to avoid controversy,\nthey then arranged a second speaker,\nGhada Karmi, to replace Dr Tamimi,\nand invited Prof Newman to rejoin the\npanel, which he accepted.\nThe Jerusalem Post, a widely read\nIsraeli newspaper, subsequently published a story stating that Prof Newman had withdrawn from the debate,\nan article which was widely disseminated in various press publications.\nMeanwhile the event organisers Ammar Waraich and Farid Froghi were\nsubject to a barrage of angry emails,\nmessages and phone calls from people\ndisappointed at the treatment of Dr\nTamimi, also levelling accusations of\npro-Israeli bias and Islamophobia at\nthe distressed pair.\nThe PPS issued a statement at the\nevent (see below) explaining the society\u2019s position. The majority of the debate ran smoothly and was attended\nby almost 150 people. However, this\nstatement did not quell some of the\nill-feeling in the audience, especially as\nthe event itself was on such a divisive\nissue. One member of the audience\ncalled for an apology from the society\nover the treatment of Dr Tamimi, and\naccused the event of paralleling the\n\u201cIsraeli-dictated\u201d situation in Palestine,\neven going on to say during the discussion of terrorist activity that: \u201c...I also\nsupport suicide bombing, in that case.\u201d\nThe organisers will be relieved that\nthe event marginally managed to avoid\ndescending from conflict study into an\noutright conflict in itself.\n\n"

Dev was\na member of the short-lived band Test\nIcicles who received limited critical ac-claim, but still had East London club-bers dancing for a year or two before\nthe group parted. This album marks\na large shift from the loud, aggres-sive, style-over-substance nature of his\nprevious band. Don\u2019t worry, though -from the look of the album cover he\nstill manages to have an approach to\nfashion that sets him apart from the\nrest (but with less pink and neon now,\nthankfully).\nThe music could be roughly described as Indie-folk with a few hints of\ncountry thrown in.

Despite\nthis, Falling off the Lavender Bridge\nstill manages to sound unique. After a\nbrief intro song with the highly creative name \u2018Number One\u2019, the album\nstarts gently pulling the listener in with\n\u201cGalaxy Of The Lost\u201d. The deliciously\ncatchy tune sets the tone for the album\nwith light acoustic guitars, pianos and\nmild drumming, backing the almost\nmusical sounding vocals.

Our reviewers donated their ears to save you the trouble\nby pop singer-songwriters of the Allen\nand Nash type.\nDev has managed to craft some\nbeautiful pop songs while also maintaining his indie scenester credibility.\nHis voice sounds its best when struggling to reach and hold long notes,\nexposing a harshness that contrasts\nwith the overall softness of the album.\nUpon listening to the lyrics, however,\nit\u2019s clear that theses songs are anything\nbut cute. \u2018Tell Me What It\u2019s Worth\u2019\nflows perfectly on from the second\nsong and, with its catchy beat and pop\nsensibilities, it is a clear choice for a\nsingle. The lyrics hint at abuse that Dev\nhas experienced for not conforming to\nthe racial stereotypes expected of him,\nMyspace. Myspace. In the past few\nyears, there has been this prevailing\ntrend of making it big through good\nold Myspace. With the likes of Kate\nNash and Lily Allen, everyone is wanting a slice of fame and what a perfect\nway to promote oneself and one\u2019s mu-sic. In the case of 19 year old Londoner\nAdele, Myspace seems to have done a\nvery satisfactory job. Being best friends\nwith Jack Penate may, according to\nsome, have helped her on her way to\nstardom, shall we say.\n\u2018Chasing Pavements\u2019 follows Adele\u2019s\nfirst limited edition single \u2018Hometown\nGlory\u2019; this sweet, mellow number reflects lost love and regret, something\nthat most of us sadly have to endure\nOh, Morrissey. What are we going to\ndo with you? Following his surprisingly\nwell-received \u2018Ringleader of the Tormentors\u2019 just a year or so ago, he\u2019s back.\nErm. Sort of. Recently, he\u2019s sold out 5\nnights at the Camden Roundhouse,\nsoon there\u2019s a Greatest Hits compila-tion, with a couple of new tracks on,\nthis and the drippingly ironic \u2018All You\nNeed is Me\u2019. You know, this is going to\nmark me out as a bit of a fanboy, but\nsurely he actually knows this is the\nkind of devilry he slated in The Smiths\u2019\nPaint a Vulgar Picture? It even says \u201cextra track and a tacky badge\u201d. It\u2019s not\nlike things are bad for Morrissey fans\nthough. It\u2019s got the chugging power\nchords that he\u2019s become fond of again,\nnow and again. But heh, that\u2019s life. Her\nvoice is surprisingly soulful; strong and\nrich unlike Kate and Lily who have little to offer in terms of vocal versatil-ity. Melancholic, tinged with nostalgia,\none truly feels a sense of helplessness - \u2018Should I give up? Or should I\njust keep chasing pavements even if\nit leads nowhere\u2019? Certainly, it makes\none question one\u2019s own life, whether\nit\u2019s worthwhile chasing for that something beyond reach. To be or not to be\nis the $64,000 question. Adele\u2019s voice\nis unquestionably a revelation. With\nthe gloriously soaring chorus complemented by powerful strings and brass,\nyou\u2019ll have this tune stuck in your head\nfor a long long while.\nIndeed, Adele is a talent to watch out\nfor this year. The new Amy Winehouse\nis in town. Let\u2019s hope there will be no\nmentioning of rehab. Chasing Pavements sure delivers the goods!\nSusan Yu\nand the typical hum-de-dum melody\nthat\u2019s sure to get stuck in your head for\na bit. A sprinkle of self-pitying but not\noverly whiney lyrics (they\u2019re about how\nyou don\u2019t really find love when you\u2019re\nyoung, but that\u2019s just part of life) sung\nin \u2013 er \u2013 Morrissey\u2019s style, and you\u2019ve\ngot another single-worthy track. I\u2019m\nnot really sure what to say. It\u2019s hardly\na radical departure from his previous\nwork. If you already like him, you\u2019ll\nprobably like it. It\u2019s not a particularly\ngreat song though, and certainly not\nabout to convert you if you\u2019ve already\ndecided that you hate his guts and that\nhe can stick his stupid fucking flowers\nup his stupid fucking quiff-laden arse.\nMatt Long\nBitesize chunks of tasty, tasty music\nI\u2019ll say it here and now, up front: El\nGuincho makes super catchy tropical\npop sounds which capture the sound\nof summery Spanish festivals and seals\nit up into four-minute-long musical\npackages of joy.\nAlegranza, released in Spain last\nsummer, sounds a lot like Animal Collective\u2019s tribal psyche-folk would if\nthey had grown up in Barcelona and\nspent their teenage years getting high\nunder the stars at tropical beach par-ties, instead of the sadly less exciting\nscenery of Baltimore, Maryland.\nMuch like a hot, sticky, wonderful dream, there are dancing drum\nrhythms, tribal chants and hand claps\nin Cuanda Maravilla Fui, steel drums\nand whistles in Kalise and a sprinkling of magical sparkly sounds in the\nsingle Fata Morgana. Overlaid with\nsickly, sweetly, lovingly sung melodies\nand quirky spoken samples, all of this\nmelds together and laps over your high\nstung Imperial-student nerves like the\nwarm Catalonian Ocean over your\nsun-baked toes. Some may dislike the\nrepetitive nature of the songs, but if\nyou enjoyed Person Pitch last year (yes,\nit\u2019s impossible to escape the Panda Bear\nreference), you\u2019ll enjoy this also, as it\u2019s\nin much the same vein.\nIt\u2019s taken a while for his album to finally be picked up by a UK seller, but\nit\u2019s the perfect thing to cheer you up\non these dreary February days. Hurry\nup for one of the 25 copies available for\nsale on the Rough Trade website. lter-natively, just listen to it all for free on\nhis MySpace page, you cheap bastard.\nClemy Walker\nPeter Sinclair\nMusic Editor\nH\ni, nice to meet you. I\u2019m\nPeter. The fabulous\nSusan Yu and myself\nare the new Felix music\neditors (look forward\nto Susan\u2019s mugshot next week). We\nwill be your gateway into the world of\nawesome music, taking you by your\nclammy little hands and leading you\nthrough the minefield that is being\nsuper-cool in the London music scene.\nThat being said, you had better start\nkissing our asses - we have tremendous influence now. I\u2019m joking of\ncourse but, you know, better safe than\nsorry.\nSo now that we know each other a\nlittle better, let me tell you about my\nproblems. It\u2019s February, it\u2019s mid term,\nand my favourite Azalea plant is dying\nin front of my eyes because I live in\na fucking basement flat that is lucky\nto see five minutes of sunlight a day.\nWinter really is a depressing time of\nyear. As the great bluesman Robert\nJohnson once said, \u201cI woke up this\nmorning and all my shrimps was dead\nand gone. I got Dead Shrimp Blues\u201d.\nI may not be from Mississippi, and\nI may never have been fishing in my\nlife, but I understand what he\u2019s talking\nabout.\nNot wanting to wallow in my own\nDead Shrimp Blues, I have turned\nmy thoughts towards summer and\nthe annual piss-up hoedown of the\nsummer festival season. The publicity\ndepartment of Glastonbury began to\ncrank it up this week with the opening of ticket \u2018registrations\u2019 on the 1st,\nand the announcement of a couple of\nheadliners to get the mouths of the\nmasses salivating. Amongst them, in\na move that is sure to attract much\ncriticism from festival purists, the\nJigga Man himself, Jay-Z, has been\nconfirmed as a main feature. Don\u2019t get\nme wrong, I think Jay-Z is awesome,\nbut for a festival that wants to be edgy\nand maintain the hippy festival spirit\nof old, it\u2019s a bit of a poor show, adding\nmore fodder to the growing backlash\nagainst the now shamelessly middle-class mainstream festivals. This has\nbeen the case for a good few years,\nso it is by no means the beginning of\nthe end for festival culture, but once\nthe cool has gone, it\u2019s only a matter of\ntime before the money is gone and the\npeople go elsewhere.\nI\u2019m not totally cynical about festivals\njust yet. One great thing that has come\nout of their growing popularity is the\nvariety of festivals off the beaten track\nwhich could never be sustainable\nwithout the popularity of the main-stream. This summer I\u2019m hoping to\ngo to a minimalist-electro festival in\nAustria, but closer to home there\u2019s a\nwhole load of folk and jazz and whatever festivals for those of you who are\nas sick to death of the NME as I am.\nIn other news, the NME awards are\ncoming up soon. I implore you all to\ngive as little of a shit as I do.\nand the lines \u201cClean your blades and\nstart swinging, don\u2019t stop till the red\nruns out\u201d long to be sung along with,\ndespite their brutal message.\nThe final song, \u2018No Surprise (For\nWendela)\u2019 starts with singing that instantly brings Weezer to mind while\nthe music slowly builds up in layers,\nculminating with a string section, wind\ninstruments and the repeated line \u201cThe\nmore I hear, the more I hate\u201d. Thankfully, the same is not true for this al-bum, with each listening bringing out\nsubtle parts that are missed on first inspection and some brilliant pop songs\nto introduce a new year of music.\nJames Houghton\nIf you fancy reviewing some\nmusic or gigs, send us an email\nto music.felix@imperial.ac.uk and\nget yourself on the mailing list.\nFree music giveaway soon, stay\ntuned!\nLightspeed Champion poses with a plastic deer\n\n"
