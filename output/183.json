Unfortunately there was a shortage\nof advertising for a sixth issue this term, and as FELIX is now\nrun on \" pay your way \" lines, it was though that it would be\nnecessary to forego the Christmas, end of term, edition. However,\nin view of the large number of events taking place in the last two\nweeks, and the small surplus which we have managed to build up\nover the term, it was finally decided to bring out a six page issue,\nthis giving approximately the same amount of articles and news as\ndoes an eight page issue with advertising. Those who consider\nthemselves grossly overcharged should remember that the last issue\nwas also sold at 4d. despite the fact that it had ten pages.\nIt is never too early for advance notices, and the one that\nthe Editor would like to make in this column is that the first issue\nnext term- Will be on sale on January 16th, just before the Union\nmeeting. Copy day for this issue will be January 9th and 10th. Contributors who want to submit articles at the last minute should try\nand get them typewritten, as this improves their chances of acceptance.\nThe Editor would also like to take this opportunity to wish all\nreaders a Merry Christmas, and to thank all his regular staff and\noccasional contributors for the support-and encouragement which has\nmade this term's FELICE S possible. It is to be hoped that examination fever will not remove all of them next term.\nON THE SIGHT COLCUTT\nbroken furniture.

It is hoped\nthat the absence of ads. about\ncareers will not worry anybody\nunduly over the vac. If it does,\nthe the solution is to take a free\ncopy of \"Graduate Careers\" from\nthe pile in the Union Entrance\nHall. This is an excellent magazine which is worth reading even\nby those who aren't worried\nabout a career. The pity is that\nno system of distribution has\nbeen organised with the result\nthat the piles Of this magazine\nare at the moment littering the\nUnion.\nWhile on the subject of litter\nin the Union, I could well comment on the rubbish which is\ncluttering up the place this term\n\u2014 particularly in the Upper\nLounge, table tennis room, gym,,\nback stairs, etc. Most of the\njunk is the bin ro duet of the Carnival, Smoking Concert and\ni Drama Soc. activities. Adding to\nthe general mess are pieces of\neyesore.\nThe present state of the gym\nnasi um is a disgrace to the College. The ceiling has been badly\ndamaged and the floor has not\nbenefited from hv a ing Carnival\nflats dragged across it and\nweights dropped on it. The ceilings damage is especially disturbing as it is obviously caused by\nirresponsible vandals who seem\nto take delight in damaging property not belonging to them per-son ally. The same attitude is displayed by the hoodlums who\nwalk on the grass in the quad.\nAdmittedly the turf wil l never b good enough for croquet, but it\nwould at least look presentable if\ngiven a chance, and if it was not\ntrampled on after wet weather\nThe Union cannot afford to spend\nlarge sums to make good the\ndamage made by irresponsible\nmembers, but it really should not\nhave to. Next time that vo u are\nwalking across the grass, kicking\na ball at the g vm ceiling, or just\nbreaking a chair in the refectory\njust think . . .\nhtm tb thE d lt bL Dear Sir,\nHowever necessary for admin-is t ration, the division of l.C. Clubs into three groups has dis-advantages. Not least among\nthese is the inference that the\nmembers of the College are divided into \" Social\" or \" Sporting \" types with conflict of interests tacitly assumed. The caricatures of beer swilling empty-headed sportsmen and hair split-ting, anaemic gas-bags are not to\nbe taken as photographs. College\nChristian groups have fielded\ntheir own soccer teams and the\nRugger club offers more social\nlife than many social clubs.\nMembership of social and athletic\nclubs is no contradiction in\nterms; indeed it is, I would sub-mit, an ideal often realised.\nIt is for this reason that 1 object\nmost strongly to the suggestion\nthat the N.U.S. issue is to be discussed in terms of social v. athletic clubs. I was sorry that this\nwas done in the last issue of Felix\nin an article which creates the\ndanger that this debate will develop into a slang ing match.\nPhrases such as \" crude illogical\nnonsensical rubbish,\" \" raising\nfanatical instincts,\" and references to a student body whose\nmembership is so vast as a\" National Aquarium of little\nfish in too deep water \" are a disgrace to their author, your paper\nand to the reasonable discussion\nof any objections of the college to\njoining N.U.S. Yours sincerely,\nGEORGE TURNER.\nDear Sir,\nThe appearance of an article in\nFelix against joining N.U.S. seems to have dropped like a bomb in the pro N.U.S. camp\u2014\ncomments have ranged from \" resign \" to \" disgrace to their au-thor.\" However, if half the interest is picked up by all Union\nmembers then we are guaranteed\na representative opinion on this\nissue at the next Union meeting\u2014\nthe aim of the President and my-self. I regret that Mr. Turner\nfeels bitter at my methods, but as\na debater I feel sure that he will\nagree that the rules of persuasion,\nwhether to fill a Union meeting or\nto carry a motion, are a trifle\ndifferent to those of the Rugby\nfield.\nWith regard to splitting the\nUnion, this is the last thing that\nI would advocate. But if we join\nN.U.S. the finance must come\nfrom somewhere. The proposer s of the motion are well aware that\nwe will be unable to finance it\nfrom reserves as they anticipated\nand in this case I feel that the\npeople who are going to be restricted to acer tian extent by lack\nof finance, i.e., the Athletic Clubs,\nfrom whom the majority of the\nmoney may be eventually nibbled,\nshould be well aware of this fact.\nJ.B. PREECE'.\nCARNIVAL FUND\nDear Sir,\nIt is perhaps unfortunate that\nthe vote was nearly equal, for the\ninevitable se isms are now appear-ing. The insidious demands for\nreversals strike at the very heart\nof the Union directive apparatus.\nIf we are to do as Mr. Dauman\nbids, we are going to open the\ndoor to the \" stab in the back \"\npolitics of the Ceasars, where reason gave way to hysterical emo-tion.\nSpeaking as a supporter of\nmental health, I would urge all\nthinking members of the Union to\nsupport a motion passed at the\nlast meeting.\nYours sincerely,\nJ. H. McKERROW, C&G. Dear Sir,\nIt is a sad, but true fact, that\nalthough the Arabian National\nAnthem was played, in full, at the\nstart of the Cabaret for the\nGuilds-Mines Carnival, not one\nperson stood up.

    "content": "- 6 FELIX Swimming Gala\nDespite the loss of last year's top swimmers, spectators were left\nin no doubt as to the strength of IC swimming and water polo teams.\nThe individual events were far from one-sided, Guilds and Mines\neach gaining two firsts, whilst RCS had one. Davies (Mines) and\nHennessy (Guilds) were impressive in the butterfly and the backstroke\nrespectively, while the breaststroke proved to be the closest race, the\nthree competitors all finishing within one second of each other.

CHAMPIONSHIP CUP A buzz of excitement went round a rather room in U.L. U. last\nMarch when the 1st Round of the U.L. Cup was announced. The\nfirst balls out of the bag indicated Q.M. C. v.I.C., the two finalists\nin the 1962 competition. It was rumoured then that the winners\nof this match would win the Cup. The final result remains to be\nseen, but after two hard games I.C. are through into the 2nd Round\nversus Goldsmiths' in January.\nGuys Hospital lost 3-2\nUniversity College won 4-1\nThiaterm won 11, lost 1\nfrom the cloakroom \u2014 a return 2 nd team won5 lost g of these would be appreciated.\nPlaying in disgusting weather\nat Brentwood, I.C. were forced to\nreplay at Harlington on Sat.,\nDec. 1st. Under perfect conditions and urged on by seven\nmegaphoned supporters, the Cupholders started well. Their wing-halves (Austin and Huxtable)\ntook control of the centre of the\nfield and with the full-backs keeping tight on their wing-men,\nJames strong again at centre-half\nthe Q.M. C. forward line was\ngiven little room in which to\nmove.\nOn the large pitch I.C. endeavour ed to attack on a broad\nfront, but time and again this\nplan broke down when a cross\nfrom one of the wingers was\nheaded harmlessly to Q. M.C.'s very efficient goalkeeper. Occasionally the Q.M. C. forward line\nbroke loose, their centre-forward\ntwice shooting just wide. These\nbursts were short-lived, however,\nwhen misfortune struck the visitors twice in ten minutes. The\ncentre-half went limping on to the\nleft wing, and the right-half was\ncarried off, injured in the fierce\ntackling which is a feature of all\ncup-ties.\nReduced to ten men, Q.M. C. were driven still further back into\ntheir own half but with a well\norganised defence they managed\nto survive several onslaughts\nfrom I.C. The hitter's defence\nwatched in frustration as their\ncolleagues came so near to finish-ins the approach to goal. Twenty\nminutes from full-time Fisher\nwent u o to head across from the\nleft. The referee awarded ao enal ty to T.C. for a push in the\nback and Fisher drove the ball\nlow into the net. Q.M. C.f ou a ht hard for the equalise r but with\nten men the pace of the game\nbegan to tell and I.C., rather\nluckily are one step nearer to the\nU.L.

    "content": "FELIX\nI.C. Dramatic from p.4 creaky affair had many extremely\nfunny moments. Judy Lewis and\nCarol Melville as the mother and\ndaughter of dubious social standing making a frontal assault on\nthe establishment had a successful\ntime of it, even though Carol's part must have been very trying\n\u2014she is always on the verge of\nreleasing some emotion when\nAnouilh puts his foot in the\nflood gates. Andrew Page played\nthe part of the butler with quiet\ndistinction, while Chris Masterman raged and moaned brilliantly as a somewhat youthful\nmillionaire. Carolle Lovell,\nBrenda Chant and H. Strasse\ncompeted a well drilled and competent cast.\nOne or two aspects of the pro-duct ion, it must be said, seemed\nto get a little out of joint. Ac cording to the programme, nobody was responsible for the\nmusic, and this was all too ap-parent. We had what sounded\nlike a random selection from\nDancing Class stock which\nmade it rather difficult to conjure up the picture of an elegant\nsociety ball twirling and twiddling just off stage. A little precious magic was lost here. The\nlighting crew seemed to have\ntheir own ideas of when a scene\nshould start, which did not\nalways coincide with the activity\non the stage. Again, although\nlines were delivered confidently\nwithout any recourse to a prompter, they were by no means\nalways the lines in my copy of\nthe play, and some hair-raising\nomissions and contractions took\nplace.\nThe Society are nevertheless\nto be c no gra tula ted on a very impressive effort at an extremely\ndifficult play. This certainly\naugurs well for the IC bid to retain the Clee Cup in the next UL Competition.\nRCS SMOKING CONCERT\" It's clean this year,\" was the\nrallying cry of this year's Smoking Concert, in place of the\n'Cor Br of two years ago.\n\" Culture for the masses, whether\nthey like it or not\" was the\ntheme of Chris Tye's comp e ring, and although there was not much\nculture, there was not much\nbawdy obscenity. There was no\ngreat surfeit of top talent, either,\nthe free beer tending to make up\nfor this.\nThe acts in the first half were\na little slow, with a few exceptions. This year saw the first\nperformance of the Shadies,\nan RCS Big Beat group with a good line in amplified guitars,\nand a supporting vocal group\nwhich have obviously been gen-ning up on the latest in background \"ooh-a ahs,\" to good\neffect. Norman Price, complete\nwith a fine pair of snake hips,\ndid the solo vocal, with a full\nspectrum of a gon is ed expressions\nin the best EP style.\n\" Latrinus Publicus \" and \" Dr.\nNo\" went down quite well,\nthough the jokes seemed a little\nstereo tv ped. It is always a bit\nof a shock to see familiar faces\nin a strange rig-out and just the\nappearance of the Roman Senators in their white togas was good\nenough for a long laugh. Among\nthe solo acts, Simon Adlam on\nthe ladder and Mike King on the\npneumatic drill, were excellent,\nthe other acts missing out somewhat by their use of the stage\nmicrophone amplifying system\nwhich has never been too good,\nand certainly could not cope with\na noisy audience.\nThe second half saw a more\nalive audience (rowdier) and\nseveral good acts, among them\n\" The Dales\" and \"To-night,\"\nwhich included a song sung by\na kilt-clad Welshman, Emlyn\nJones, who appeared to one of\nthe most unmusical people. The\nhighlights of this half again were\nthe musical ones, the talking\nblues of Dick Smith and the reappearance of the Shadies with\ntheir show stopper \" Guildsman\nin Jail\": They've got the Spanner,\nIt's too big to loose,\nBut its B \u2014 y useless\nLike all Guildsmen's tools . . .\netc.,(to the tune of \"Teenager\nin Love \").\nAll in all, a good effort by\nBryan Hooper and Kish to cut\ndown filth while keeping up in-te rest. As for the Shadies, they\ncould well provide some occasional beat music for the less far\nwould certainly be api tv if the v out cats at College Hops\u2014it\ndisappeared from the scene, after\nthe success they enjoyed at the\nSmoking Concert.\nA.T. P.L.C. CARNIVAL During this week, Carol\nSinging is being organized every\nevening. Last year singers from\nthe College collected over \u00a3300;\nwhether it was given out of gratitude or desperation is far from\nclear ; and this year it is hoped\nto double that total. So come\nalong one evening ; if your singing is not all that hot, it doesn't really matter, volume is more important that quality, and if you\njust haven't got a voice at all; well, somebody's got to rattle the\ntin !\nTONY STOCK. R.C.S. REVIEW This term has seen the introduction of the new constitution\ninaugurated by the McPherson regime. The size of the general committee has been reduced by having only one representative per depart-ment, instead of reps for each undergraduate year and one for postgraduates in the big departments like Physics or Maths. This reduction has been accompanied by a rise in efficiency, though the success\nof the present system is dependent on close contact between the\ndepartment rep. and the appropriate year reps. This year, this\nappears to have been achieved.\nAt the beginning of the term,\nthe Clubs Committee elected\nFred Dobner as its new Chairman. Although most of the\nclubs received a reduced grant,\nmost of them have been fairly\nactive, with the exception of the\nChemical Society, which this\nyear has been a pale shadow of\nits former self.\nThe Entertaintainments Committee has run one excellent\nSaturday Dance and successfully\nproduced the Smoking Concert\n(see other pages), and is now at\nwork on next term's Carnival, to\nbe held on Friday, 8th March,\nand has even started on ideas for\nthe Summer Ball. Anyone with\nideas for these events should\ncontact the Committee. Incidentally the name of any RCS rep. can be found in the RCS directory on the departmental\nnotice boards.\nFRESHER S' DINNERS This year there were four din-ner s. The ladies were present at\nthe last two. Wine was served\nat all the dinners and in consequence they tended to be quieter\nand more sober than the beer\ndinners of the other Colleges.\nAfter the last two dinners, a bar\nwas set up in the TV lounge so\nthat the men could get together\nwith the lady fresher s over a drink. This brought forth protests from the hardened boozers\nbecause the number of singers in\nthe bar was much diminished.\nThis year there was a severe\nshortage of second year hosts because of the very large number\nof fresher s, but some public\nspirited third year men vol unter ed to act as hosts for the\nsecond time and most of the\nfresher s were entertained. The\nfew . fresher s who were not accompanied had a free dinner on\nthe Union.\nOn November 2nda reception\nwas held for postgraduate\nfresher s to enable them to meet\neach other, and some members of\nstaff. About 50 per cent, timed\nup, and it is hoped to hold regular postgraduate evenings in\nfuture.\nUNION MEETINGS0 There have been two Union\nMeetings this term. At the first,\nthere were elections of year reps.,\nQueen of Jezebel, and a second\nTrophy Officer was elected. The\nsecond meeting \\yas a sports meeting at which the Trophy Officers\nwere tried for the loss of Theta.\nTHE THETA AFFAIR Theta was stolen from the inside of a wardrobe in a locked\nroom in the New Hostel after\nthe third Freshers' Dinner\nClues subsequently sent from an\nanonymous engineering College\nin Exhibition Road led to the\nCaltex Oil offices in London, the\nBlundell's Arms in Horwich, the\nCity Arms in Billingham, and\nWankie Colliery in Southern\nRhodesia. To save delay in\nwaiting for a reply from the Dark\nContinent, the President of Guilds\ninvited the President of RCS to\nperform a forfeit in front of the\nGuilds Union Meeting. After\nMr. Harris had sung and danced\nto the satisfaction of the en-g in e ers, Theta was returned to\nRCS and is now in safe keeping.\nSPORT SECTION On the last Friday of November RCS entertained the Maths,\nand Phys. Soc. of Birmingham\nUniversity at Harlington. RCS turned out \" sport\" teams, but\nBirmingham had other ideas,\nwith the result that although we\nwon at Soccer 8\u20142, the Rugby\nteam lost 3\u201421. On the same\nevening, two coach loads of RCS supporters went to Marshall\nStreet Baths to see their team\nfinish last.\nEXCURSIONS It is hoped next term to have\nan RCS excursion, to take the\nform of an afternoon of sporting activities with a sport even-ing. A return trip to Birmingham would be ideal for a return\nmatch. An evening outing to the\nWindmill has also been suggested. The whole matter is now\nin the hands of a special sub-committee, and anyone with\nideas should contact Norman\nPrice of Physics II.\nSMALL ADS.

Spannerama\nUNION MEETING\nThe last Guilds Union Meeting was held on the 30th November\nin room 542 El building. The minutes of the last meeting were\nread out, and duly acclaimed by all present, including in the newly\nbroken-in fresher s. The President then displayed a long thin red and white object,\nknown to some, we believe, as Theta. That we still have it is due\nabout s. It was therefore decided to give it back to its owners on\nmainly to the inability of RCS to solve the clues as to its where-the condition that one Mr. Harrys paid a forfeit. So, heralded by\na bright flash (and subsequent smog) he appeared resplendent in\nwhat looked like a corduroy dressing gown. Prompted by Mr. Liddle,\nand to the wavering accompaniment of the latest oriental hit, he\ndanced somewhat un imaginatively to and fro along the bench.\nThis was not enough for one section of Guildsmen, whose thirst\nfor a garment worn usually by\nmales around the lower part of\nthe body bordered on the inde-cent. To placate these pantal o on a tics. he sang one verse of a somewhat bawdy song believed\nto have originated in the Rural\nCollege of Signs. Having tired of\nthis Christian, the two top lions\nescorted him and the mascot from\nthe meeting to the strains of the\nfuneral march from Salad Days.^\nThere were two correspondents\n-\u2022Lord Rayon and Spud. The\nfirst letter was read out by John\nWhite standing in the sink. Attempts to make him grow larger\nby watering his feet were discouraged by simple yet effective\nmeans. Spud's letter was in the\nnature of a challenge as he proposed that Guilds and Mines\nshould have a friendly competition in the Union Bar after the\nSwimming Gala. The challenge\nwas accepted and an account of\nthe Swimming Gala can be found\nelsewhere in this issue.\nSomewhere in the course of\nthe proceedings, a new society,\nthe Contact Bridge Club, was\nproposed. The proposer gave a summary of the less intricate\nrules of the game, punctuated\nwith laughter. One of your correspondents did not see the joke,\nthe other one curled up on the\nfloor making peculiar gurgling\nnoises.\nThe Boat Club Captain toasted\nhimself for the Morphy Day successes, the gathering singing\n\" For he's a jolly good fellow,\"\nat somewhere near a quarter\ntempo.\nPete Griffiths then put in some\nplugs for the Engineers' Dinner\nDance, and received thanks for\nhis organisation of the Carnival.\nThe Meeting was finally closed\nwith a BOO MALAK A. Owing\nto the injury of his finger, the\nPresident excused himself from\nholding up the Spanner, thus\nkeeping up his record of not having done a complete Boomalaka\nthis session. With commendable\nhumanity, thes members shouted\ndown Mr. White's offer to act as\nsubstitute, and elected Mr. Klaschka as Spanner holder (he\nbeing the smallest members of the\nExecutive), which du tv he performed efficiently, albi et two-handedly.\nENGINEERS' DINNER DANCE Sir Harold Roxy Cox has\nkindly accepted the invitation to\nbe the principal guest at this\nyear's dinner on January 25th. RING AROUND THE MOON The IC Dramatic Society's Christmas production of \" Ring\nAround the Moon\" by Anouilh\nwas given four performances last\nweek. Translated from the\nFrench by Christopher Fry, this\nis in the unfamiliar idiom of the\n\" co media del'arte\" which can\nbe described as a charade without music. \u2022 In a charade, no\nstrong emotions are aroused, no\nformal ideas are developed and\nno specific causes embraced.\nSuccess or failure depends critically on the sheer personality and\nacting ability of the group, which\nhas to solve questions of rhythm\nand balance without which the\nmagic collapses and all that is\nleft is a string of small talk.\nBryan Hooper, the President of\nthe Drama Soc., paying the\ntricky double part, had a smooth\nevening; perhaps Frederick\ncould have had a little more\nwarmth, but Hugo had plenty of\ncynical icy glitter. Jenny Desmond as the aunt gave a very fine\nperformance indeed, avoiding the\npitfall of being merely crotchety.\nShe has excellent stage presence\nand a particularly good musical\ndiction.

    "content": "NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION No. 183 Tuesday, 11th DECEMBER,19624 d. GUILDS\nGALA The long awaited day finally came and as evening approached,\ngroups of merry supporters left Queens and made their way to the\ncoach assembly points. Just before 8 p.m. coaches started arriving\nin the vicinity of Marshall Street Baths and disgorging masses of\nbearded and be-s carved students, mostly of the engineering variety,\none of the RCS coaches forgetting to turn up, leaving a proportion\nof RCS supporters at the mercy of London Transport.\nShortly after eight, the opposing factions sorted themselves out\ninto neat blocks in the spectators galleries of the baths, and after\nrousing Boomalakas, Kangellas,\netc., started to join in a\" what\nare we waiting for \" whereupon\nthe Captain of the Swimming\nClub appeared and announced\nthe first race.\nThe individual races, spurred\non by vigorous cheering from\nthe sides of the baths, were soon\nover, with Mines and Guilds level\nat two first places each, RCS with only one. These were followed by the two team races\nwhich were both won by Guilds.\nThen came the highlight of the\nevening\u2014the Presidents' Race.\nWe had to wait a bit for this because the President of I CW A apparently mislaid the top of her\nBikini, also there was some difficulty in getting the Guilds President on to his air bed, and even\nmore difficulty in getting him to\nstay on it. During the proceedings various other persons also\nmanaged to take the water in the\nbest Gala traditions. The race\nwas finally won by Mr. Chandmal, who swam a smooth and relaxed crawl to pip the I CW A President, encumbered with aI'o b ted candle, to the post. Chris\nLiddle finally had to be pulled\nacross the baths with a piece of\nstring, otherwise it was feared\nthat he would never arrive. By\nmeans of this subterfuge, he even\nmanaged to beat Mike Harris to\nthe finish.\nThe water Polo was next, but\nafter the first two matches, attention swung to what had once been\na shapely hat, but was now just a missile for throwing across the\nbaths. Here RCS definitely had\nthe up,-er hand, in the form of\nDave Dean, the Guilds throws\nfalling persistently short.\nAfter the last match. Guilds\nwere declared the overall winners,\nand the President of I CW A handed out the prizes. At this\npoint, the Swimming Captain\nmentioned that unfortunately the\nWarden of UL U was not with us.\nbut to make up for it, the UL U Pool had provided us with a prize for the winner of the Presidents' race. The horrified President of IC discovered that he\nhad been handed a handsome\npolished s isn from a certain\nswimming baths in the immediate vic in itv of Malet Street.\nThe evening was finally term-mina t^d with a rowdy session in\nthe IC bar.\nSelwyn Lloyd at LC.\nThe Main Physics Lecture\nTheatre was filled almost to\nbursting last Tuesday for the\nGeneral Studies Lecture by ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer\nSelwyn Lloyd, M.P. Discussing\n\" The Current Political Situation,\" he said that, in view of\nthe \" horrible alternatives,\" it\nwas vital that the Conservative\nParty win the next General\nElection. In defence of this\nstatement later, he said that both\nthe opposition parties were promising vast increases in Government spending, apparently without any increase in taxation.\nSuch a policy could only lead to\ndisastrous inflation, the very\nthing he had striven to avoid\nwhilst Chancellor. Describing in\nsome detail the reasons behind\nsome of the actions he took as\nD. Bourne\nChancellor, he gave a fascinating\ninsight into the intricacies of the\ntask.\nInternationally, the economic\ntrends are against Britain; the\nr uw ly developing countries are\nbeginning to provide for themselves the services formerly supplied by us, and the balance of\npower is shifting inevitably to\nthe larger economic blocs. For\nthis reason alone, it is very much\nin our interests to become a part\nof the E.E.C. However, on the\nquestion Of a Federal System of\nGovernment for Europe, he said\nthis would have to be considered\nseparately. He doubted if it\nwould come \" within our life-time.\"\nAfter a confused piece of rhetoric from Frank Fuchs was\nspeedily cut short by the chair-man, Mr. Lloyd dealt very\nquickly with a large range of\ntopics. He was quite willing to\ncomment on his recent dismissal\nfrom the cabinet ; he spirited ly defended the right of the Premier\nto make any changes in the team\nhe wanted to. A statement which\nwas warmly applauded. Asked\nwhether he did not think the time\nhad come for a change of cap-tain, he just smiled.\nAt the end of the questioning,\nhe was thanked for giving the\nCollege a part of his very full\nday. \" Oh,\" he replied, with a rueful grin, \" I am not as busy\nnow as I used to be.\"\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 3 -NUS - Yes or no\nT.D. P., otherwise my friend John Preece, had some fairly outspoken things to say in the last issue of FELIX about the prospect\nof Imperial College affiliating to the National Union of Students.\nNo one that I know of, among the many in this college who\nhave voiced their support for our entry into N.U.S., has ever seriously\nput forward refectory improvements as one of the benefits of member-ship. Yet on the sere ng th of one overheard rem as fa to this effect\nby a person unknown, Mr. Preece was prepared to dismiss all our\narguments as \" crude, illogical, nonsensical rubbish,\" and to accuse us\nof attempting to \"raise the ard our of the ordinary Union member\nto a feverish pitch.\" Mr. Preece should take care that he does not\nqualify for his own descriptions, because, as he well knows, we have\nbeen determined all along that this important issue should be judged\nfairly on the facts, and we intend to present to the Union meeting\nnext term what we believe to be\nan overwhelming factual case for\nceasing to be the only major college in the whole of Great Britain\nremaining outside N.U.S. Let us\nhave no more of these wild accusations ; who ever heard of\nBob Finch \" rousing fanatical instincts \"?\nMr. Preece objects to paying'\nthe expenses of the delegates who\nwill attend the bi-annual conference of the National Union.\nBut surely these delegates will\nnot, as he seems to think, be indulging in a private political holiday ; they will be doing a very\ndemanding job of representation,\non behalf of everyone in the College. This Union pays the full\namount of Mr. Preece's Hall accommodation charge because we\nall think Mr. Preece does a good\njob (in most case) as our elected\nrepresentative, and it is also paying for Mr. Preece to go on a soccer tour to Paris because we\nthink he is going to represent us\nwell there too ; surely then it is\nbeing a bit selfish for him to turn\nround and deny our N.U.S. representatives their expenses ?\nWhat expenses the delegates\nare eventually given will depend\non the Council of this Union,\nbut they are unlikely to be more\nthan travelling expenses. To give\nseven delegates their return rail\nfare twice a year at, say. \u00a34 per\nhead for an average journey, will\namount to less than \u00a360, not \u00a3200\nas Mr. Preece quotes. With the\n\u00a3180 affiliation fee (1/3 per Union\nmember) this make about \u00a3240 in\nall, not \u00a3400. Even allowing for\nsuch eventualities as an increase\nin the number of I.C. students,\nit is unlikely that N.U.S. will cost\nus more than \u00a3300 per annum.\nWhere is the money going to\ncome from ? Well, in the first\nplace it will not be demanded\nfrom the college this academic\nyear, for if we decide to join in\nJanuary our membership will not\ntake effect until November. As next year's budget is as yet un-prepared, it is perfectly possible,\nif members of this Union so de-sire, for an allowance to be made\nfor a meagre \u00a3300 in a total of\nsome \u00a313,000. On the other\nhand the budget is likely to be a pretty tight one, judging by this\nyear's demands, and it is not the\nintention of those who, like my-self, are in favour of our joining,\nthat other legitimate requirements be refused because of our\naffiliation. The long-term answer lies in the raising of Union\nfees, which is going to be necessary anyway, N.U.S. or no\nN.U.S.; until this can be done an\ninterim solution will have to be\nfound, either by cutting our investments or drawing on our re-serves. Nobody likes drawing on\nreserves, but it is the policy of\nthe Union to do this when it considers it really necessary. We\nhave recently given \u00a35,000 of our\nreserve fund towards a new\nsports centre because we think a sports centre is a jolly good\nthing ; in the same way we can\ngive a much smaller sum to\nN.U.S. for a short period if we\nthink that N.U.S. is a good thing\ntoo.\nApart from the considerable\nconcessions we will get from\nmembership, I think it is about\ntime we in this college pulled\nour weight in national student\naffairs and did our bit generally\nfor students in this country. Let\nus hope that after January we\nshall no longer be the equivalent\nof the Flat Earth Society in the\nstudent world.\nDEBATE QUARTER-FINAL\nIn the quarter final of the UL U Debating competition, IC proposed the motion that \" This\nhouse considers Nationalism out\nof date.\" The opposers were a team from LSE. Proposing the\nmotion, Bob Finch, for IC, began\nby saying that pride in one's country was far from a bad\nthing but said that his thesis was\nthat a fanatical \" my country\nright or wrong \" attitude is both\na potential source of evil and an\nidea which has little relevance in\nthe world to-day. War was a constant danger where nationalism existed and some form of\nsupra nationalism was necessary\nto ensure peace.\nTrevor Fish, opening for LSE, said that the proposer had failed\nto tackle the real problem of\nwhether nationalism existed today and whether it had shown\nany results. The old form of\nnationalism was dying out, but\nthe nationalism in the new developing countries was playing a vital part in their advancement,\nwhich was an essential factor in\nthe stability of the world situ a tion.\nGeorge Turner, for IC, made\nthe point that the LSE team were\ntalking about entirely different\nthings. IC was proposing that\nnationalism was out of date, not\nthat it did not exist. The following LSE speakers did nothing to\nrectify this, the debate bagging\ndown on the different interpretations of the motion. Don Pearson repeated that just because\nnationalism was still with us. did\nnot mean that it was not out of\ndate. Tom Evans in his summing\nGuilds-Mines Carnival\nSH(R) IEKS OF DELIGHT The price of black market\ntickets was high, fancy dress was\nfrantically being searched out or\nstitched together, last minute\npartners were being procured(?).\nYes, the Guilds-Mines Carnival\nwas upon us.\nWe arrived at about 10 p.m., thinking that we would be among\nthe first arrivals, only to find that\nalmost everyone had already\nbeaten us to it.\nEven before we had time to\nhave a few drinks, a few dances,\nand observe the many well\nshaped women in varying stages\nof fancy undress, it was feeding\ntime (shish kebab, and very nice\ntoo). With appetites satisfied,\nwe wandered back to the Concert\nHall, which looked more like a cross between Arabia and the inside of a cave, with overtones of\nwhales and genies, and found that\nthe Clyde Valley Stampers were\nproviding that extra vitality\nneeded to prevent the floor becoming covered with a mass of\nprostrate bodies.\nRaja Liddle rampaging kept\neveryone amused, even though\nhis sword did tend to cause painful embarrassment to some\npeople. The Raja showed himself to be an excellent, swords-man, fighting a mock duel with\nthe President of Mines, who\nlooked like a typical beggar from\nthe Middle Ages in his sackcloth\nand leopard skin trunks. Sparks\nflew and so did spectators.\nThe cabaret, as is customary,\nprovided rest and laughter and\nwe were all suitably impressed\nwhen it finished. After this,\nthings got a bit drowsy, though\nmost of us remember Satchmo\nand High Society. Somewhere\naround 6 a.m. the party broke\nup, we mounted our camels and\nrode off into the sunrise of the\nnew day.\nThe next afternoon, we all\nagreed that Jimmy Marshall and\nPete Griffiths and their crews had\ndone a great job. The theme of\nthe Carnival gave plenty of scope\nfor fancy dress, and the entertainment throughout the evening was\nfirst class.\n\" Hey, where's my partner\ngone ?\"\n\" Saw her go that way with a big . . .\"\nWho's fe) BEDOUIN? P.S. \u2014Pete and Jimmy wish to\nthank all those who he'ped to\nmake the Carnival the success it\nwas.\nup for LSE repeated that the opposition had taken a reasonable\ninterpretation of the motion, and\nhad shown that it should be re-j ec ted. Asit Chanmal then gave a fact-packed, high-speed summary of\nthe arguments for the motion,\nprefacing his remarks with an ob-serva tion that the opposition reminded him of Jane Austen\u2014\nmuch Pride and Prejudice with\nlittle Sense or Sensibility. He\nconcluded by saying that the\nmotion had been shown to be\ntrue.\nMr. David Bouger, the presiding judge, then delivered the\nsumming up and the verdict. He\nwent into some detail about the\nspeeches and found LSE superior\non all counts, 219 points to 197.\nIt is difficult to reconcile this\nwith the actual debate. LSE undoubtedly scored high on elo-que n ce, particularly in the case\nof Alan Seal, but \" the duty of\nthe opposition is to adapt itself\nto the arguments presented by\nthe proposition. The team opposing the motion are responsible\nfor seeing that a clash develops,\nand it is a serious weakness in\ntheir case if they fail to do so.\"\n( UL U Handbook on the Debating Competition.) This LSE never attempted to do, no clash\ndeveloped, and it was hard to see\nhow they could have won. Mr.\nBouger seemed far too keen to\njustify his decision in what, after\nall, was a very close debate. His\nshow of personal friendship with\nthe LSE men did not go down\ntoo well, either.\nHowever, this must not detract\nfrom the high standard of the\nLSE team, which must now stand\na very good chance of winning\nthe competition again this year.\nGUILDS PRESIDENT HORS\nDE COMBAT( By our special correspondent)\nContrary to popular belief, and\nto the opinion expressed in the\narticle on the Carnival (guess\nwho wrote it), the President of\nGuilds did not distinguish himself with his swordplay on the\nnight. According to well-in-formed sources, a minor difference between the two Presidents\nled to a mock duel, in the Northeast corner of the Beit quad.\nThis was proceeding reasonably,\nsmoothly with the Guilds President demonstrating certain finer\npoints of fencing to the Mines\nPresident. When this gentleman\ndecided to try a few of them\nh't n self. the defensive tactics of\nthe Raja proved insufficient, with\nthe result that he was \" hors de\ncombat \" with a sword hand that\nwas slightly the worse for wear.\nThis and the imminent closing\nof the bar brought the duel to a close. Some time later, the President of Mines was heard to mut-ter, \" it was all a big mistake--we are just good friends.\"\n\n"
