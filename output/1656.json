The It gets\nbetter project is all but built\non this idea promoted by\nsociety that it\u2019s okay if times\nare tough now, because one\nday you will escape your\nsmall town. You will travel\nto a big city where what\nonce made you different\nand ostracised will make you\npopular and interesting. This\nis a nice narrative, but it\u2019s a\nslow burner, there is no telling\nwhen exactly things will \u2018get\nand it took the first term for\nme to realise the futility of\nreasoned debate but by then\na lot of the damage had been\ndone. It took me two years\nto start recovering from my\nresulting severe depression,\nsocial anxiety and agoraphobia that resulted.\nMale students were more\naggressive than their female\ncounterparts, often coming\nacross as personally offended\nby my lack of femininity. At\nmy first CGCU ball I lost count\nof the number of times I was\nasked why I was wearing\na suit with some people\nrepeatedly offering to buy\nme a dress for the next time,\ninsisting it was \u201ctoo weird\u201d for\nme to not wear a dress.\nIn halls I was the first trans\nperson most had met, and for\na few, the first gay person.\nMost laughed and said \u201cthey\ndidn\u2019t understand, it was\ntoo confusing\u201d and that was\nthat, but there were other\nresponses too: \u201cDo you have\na vagina?\u201d, \u201cYou\u2019re too\npretty to be gay\u201d, \u201cSo you\u2019re\nbicurious?\u201d, and my personal\nfavourite, \u201cNo you\u2019re not,\nthat\u2019s not real\u201d. The people\nI wasn\u2019t out to led to some\ninteresting insights. When\nasked about trans people one\nhousemate said: \u201cThey all\nlive in some freak-town somewhere\u201d. I must have missed\nmy eviction notice.\nOne of these male \u2018friends\u2019,\nwould try and convince me\nevery time he got drunk\nthat I was straight and that\nhomosexuality wasn\u2019t a real\nthing. This lasted two months,\nand would often happen\nin crowded rooms. No one\never said anything. How\nis a queer student meant to\nfeel safe and know they\u2019re\nnot disgusting when so many\n\u2018allies\u2019 sit by and say nothing?\nWhat about a non-binary\nstudent, with no legal gender\nrecognition, knowing if they\ndo try to make a complaint\nto hall officers, it\u2019ll have to\nbe preceded by a ten minute\ntrans 101 talk, so they can\neven grasp why you\u2019re upset.\nThe supposed society for\nLGBT people, IQ had a reputation at the time of being\na group of \u201ccis, gay white\nguys\u201d, and the IQ women\u2019s\ngroup was hyper-feminine\nto an extent that I found\nuncomfortable. I viewed it\nas just one more place to be\nharassed, if I wasn\u2019t a girl or\na guy where was I supposed\nto go? IQ has since improved\ngreatly, now with trans\nofficers, and the women\u2019s\ngroup openly welcoming\nnon-binary individuals.\nThings alleviated for me in\nlater years, I joined Women\u2019s\nRugby and the Feminist\nsociety \u2013 they were the first\nplaces I felt safe at Imperial.\nI\u2019m now in fourth year, and\nstudents that didn\u2019t understand at all in first year, now\nshare my trans friends. These\nexperiences aren\u2019t totally\nisolated to first year though, I\na week have to explain \u201cI\u2019m\nnot a boy\u201d. In areas where\nthere\u2019s drinking it\u2019s worse, I\u2019ve\nbeen asked about my genitals\nmultiple times, and recently\nwas half-dragged out of the\ntoilets by a girl.\nImperial doesn\u2019t do enough\nto support and reach out to\nqueer students who are likely\nto be the victim of harassment and experience poor\nmental health while under\ntheir care. They give us three\ntalks a year on plagiarism\nand its penalties, but none\non what is inappropriate and\noffensive behaviour towards\nany marginalised group. In\nhalls they bundle up to 300\nstudents in a limited space,\ntake your money, and then\nwish you luck. Being made to\nfind yourself disgusting and\nintolerable for something so\ninherent to your being, such\nas your gender identity, such\nas your sexuality, is a cruel\nact. Unfortunately I am not\nalone in this experience, with\nit potentially having the worst\nof consequences, 35 to 48%\nof trans people attempting\nsuicide before the age of 26.\nThis is a widespread problem,\nand there is a lack of support,\neducation, awareness, and\nclear punishments for harassing students.\nIt\u2019s taken a few years, but\nI\u2019ve eventually found an\naccepting group of friends\nwho use my correct pronouns\nand accept me for who I am.\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to suffer\nso someone else can become\neducated, but there\u2019s at least\nsometimes some positive outcome of it. In answer to the \u201cIt\ngets better\u201d narrative, it may\ndo, but it won\u2019t always be an\neasy journey. I will be graduating this year, and have had\nsome amazing experiences\nand learned so much but to\nme Imperial will always be\nthe place that could have\nbeen so much better.\n\\\\ Those fresher\u2019s\nare still the same\nstudents who were\nat your school\nthree months ago,\nit\u2019s not like they\ntook a \u2018how not to\nbe a transphobic/\nhomophobic dick\u2019\ncourse over the\nsummer \\\\\nbetter\u2019, and university should\ncertainly not be guaranteed\nas a boundary of acceptance.\nThose freshers are still the\nsame students who were at\nyour school three months\nago, it\u2019s not like they took a\n\u2018how not to be a transphobic/\nhomophobic dick\u2019 course over\nthe summer.\nI was excited about being\nout and proud from the word\ngo \u2013 this was my first mistake.\nI will say this, I was extremely\nunlucky. The first two friends\nI made in halls were very\nhomophobic and transphobic\n\\\\ One of these\nmale \u2018friends\u2019,\nwould try and\nconvince me\nevery time he got\ndrunk that I was\nstraight and that\nhomosexuality\nwasn\u2019t a real \\\\\n\\\\ In halls they\nbundle up to 300\nstudents in a limited\nspace, take your\nmoney, and then\nwish you luck \\\\\nstarted to try and get people\non my course last year to use\nmy pronouns/chosen name,\nmost still call me she/her and\nby my old name. I got in a\nfight with a friend who told\nme I needed \u201cpsychiatric\nhelp\u201d and he \u201cwanted to save\nme\u201d. I didn\u2019t report it, even\nthe well meaning tutors and\nstudents by and large are\nquite uninformed, for me it\njust wouldn\u2019t be worth it.\nSince I cut my hair short,\nusing the women\u2019s bathroom\n(the bathroom I am most comfortable in) is a challenge.\nI get a lot of stares, double\ntakes, and a couple of times\nFuckValentine\u2019sDay|Asexualandaromantic\nJoanna Wormald doesn\u2019t really have anything against V Day, but they do mind the complete\ninvisibility of asexuals and aromantics in mainstream culture\nT\nhe first two weeks\nin February are an\ninfernal nightmare\nof constant\nbombardment with\nadvertisements\nfor jewellery, chocolates,\nand lingerie \u2013 all for that\n\u2018special someone\u2019. People\nin relationships presumably\ndon\u2019t mind. Single people\ncomplain incessantly about\nit. For aromantics however,\nValentine\u2019s Day represents a\nwhole new level of hell. One\nwhich is at best an irritation.\nOn a bad day, it can provoke\noutright nausea.\nscientifically inaccurate jokes\nabout plants, mitosis, and\nrobots. Not coming out comes\nwith its own problems \u2013\nnamely the age-old question\n\u201cWhen will you get a boyfriend/girlfriend?\u201d. No matter\nhow often you try to explain\nthat you\u2019re not interested (or\nthat there are more than two\ngenders) people always seem\nto think they know what\u2019s\nbest for you. The first thing I\nheard after coming out was\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll find\nsomeone\u201d. It\u2019s astonishing that\nanyone could so spectacularly ignore everything they\nhad just heard. The whole\npoint is I don\u2019t want to find\nsomeone. Being alone is not\nan inherently terrible experi-ence. Don\u2019t pity us because\nyou assume that being single\nis a universally sad state of\naffairs. Explaining this to\npeople usually earns the\ncondescending line \u201cyou\u2019ll\nchange your mind when you\nget older\u201d. It gets worse when\npeople think they can change\nyour mind or tell you that you\nneed to be on medication\nbecause you\u2019re not normal.\nAs with most minorities,\nstereotyping is a huge issue.\nIf aromantic asexuals are portrayed as cold and heartless,\nwe\u2019re also infantilised. Apathy\nis not the same as ignorance.\nWe\u2019re not all na\u00efve and\ninnocent. We understand sex\njokes. In fact it\u2019s not uncommon for an asexual to be the\nfirst person to make a joke\njust so they can be seen to fit\nin. Non-asexual aromantics\nare viewed as promiscuous,\nespecially female aros. And\nif a non-aromantic asexual\nenters into a relationship\nbut still doesn\u2019t want to have\nsex, they\u2019re accused of being\ncruel, even abusive towards\ntheir partner.\nValentine\u2019s Day itself isn\u2019t\nthe issue, it\u2019s just the most\nobvious symptom. The\nproblem is the assumption\nthat everybody wants and\nneeds to be in a romantic and\nsexual relationship in order\nto be happy and fulfilled. The\ntruth is we don\u2019t. Emotional\nenergy is just as rewarding\nwhen it\u2019s invested in friends or\nfamily. Plenty of us are happy\nwithout any kind of committed\nrelationship whatsoever. But\nthe concept of settling down,\nin media or in classrooms.\nYou could live your whole\nlife never knowing that we\nexist. Realising you\u2019re not\nfeeling something is a difficult\nprocess full of doubt. We\nknow that we\u2019re different\nfrom most people (although\nit takes a long time to\nwork out that other people\ngenuinely are interested in\ndating and not just faking\nit) but we don\u2019t know why.\nIt\u2019s not hard to understand\nwhy so many of us grow\nup feeling broken \u2013 there\u2019s\nnobody telling us that we\u2019re\n\\\\ Hardly anyone\nknows we exist,\nwhich seems\nstrange considering\nthere are more\nof us than people\ncurrently living in\nthe UK \\\\\nWe are, put simply, people\nthat do not experience\nromantic attraction. If\nyou\u2019re asexual too (lack\nof sexual attraction if you\nhadn\u2019t already guessed) you\nget hit twice as hard since\nfor many people, sex and\nromance are inseparable.\nHardly anyone knows we\nexist, which seems strange\nconsidering there are more\nof us than people currently\nliving in the UK. Even within\nthe LGBT+ community we are\noften overlooked. Identities\non the aromantic and asexual\nspectra \u2013 those which\nexperience occasional or\nconditional attraction \u2013 are\neven less well known.\nComing out requires a\nlengthy vocab lesson and\nenduring unoriginal and\n\\\\ The first thing I\nheard after coming\nout was \u201cDon\u2019t\nworry, you\u2019ll find\nsomeone\u201d \\\\\nnot. It\u2019s time that aromanti-cism and asexuality became\ncommonplace concepts. We\nneed representation on our\nscreens and education in\nour schools. Young people\nespecially ought to be aware\nthat not feeling things doesn\u2019t\nlessen them in any way. We\u2019re\nnot broken, we\u2019re just not\ninterested. We shouldn\u2019t have\nto constantly explain and\ndefend ourselves. Let us be\nproud of who and what we\n\\\\ Coming out\nrequires a lengthy\nvocab lesson and\nenduring unoriginal\nand scientifically\ninaccurate jokes\nabout plants,\nmitosis, and\nrobots \\\\\n\\\\ In the rare case\nthat a character\nis coded as being\naromantic or\nasexual this is\ntreated as a joke or\nproblem that needs\nto be solved (think\nSherlock Holmes\nand Sheldon\nCooper) \\\\\ngetting married and having\nkids is repeatedly sold to us\nas some kind of ultimate goal\nthat we should all aspire to.\nSex and romance pervade\nalmost every film, book and\nTV show you care to name. In\nthe rare case that a character\nis coded as being aromantic\nor asexual this is treated as\na joke or problem that needs\nto be solved (think Sherlock\nHolmes and Sheldon Cooper)\nor completely ignored (the\nRiverdale TV show is erasing\nJughead\u2019s canonical asexual-ity). This is where invisibility\nreally becomes a problem.\nAromanticism and asexuality aren\u2019t talked about.\nThere\u2019s no mention of them\nare.\nHopefully in future, Valentine\u2019s Day won\u2019t be such\na harrowing time because it\nwill be seen as normal not\nto want a romantic or sexual\nrelationship. Until then, I\u2019ll\nbe following my annual\ntradition of watching horror\nmovies (where any hint of a\nrelationship is destroyed by\na murderous monster) and\neating copious amounts of\ndiscounted chocolate.\nThings I shockingly don\u2019t identify with\ndespite being an aromantic asexual\na rock\na plant\na robot\n\n"

    "content": "felix\nC U L T U R E\nFriday 10 February 2017 15\nculture.felix@ic.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk/culture\nToni Erdmann, a German-Austrian film by Maren\nAde has seen no end to\nthe praise received from\ncritics worldwide since it\u2019s\nscreenings along the festival\ncircuit in 2016. It features in\nthe top film lists of countless\nfilm magazines including\nbeing named the Best Film\nof 2016 by Sight&Sound\nand Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma and\nis also one of the favoured\npicks for the 2017 Academy\nAwards for Best Foreign Picture. Given all this acclaim,\nand as such it is always\nalso a product of pain\u201d,\nand Winfred uses this as his\n\u2018weapon\u2019 to reconnect with\nInes. The film then follows\nthis interplay between the\ntwo, Winfred inventing new\npranks and Ines responding to them and raising the\nante. It weaves through\nmoments of pure hilarity\nand stillness as Winfred\ntries to soften his daughter\u2019s\nrigid life, restore their relationship and to remind her\nto allow time to breathe.\nThe contrast between the\nlife of Winfred and of\nInes is also highlighted\nsignificantly throughout the\nfilm. Winfred is shown to\nbe concerned with the life\nInes has chosen, the tightly\nfilled schedules and her\napparent loss of humanity.\nInes on the other hand considers her father as weak\nand naive for having these\ninhibitions. Throughout the\nfilm the two are seen to\nbattle each other to find a\nmiddle ground for both their\noutlooks on life, amidst all\nconveys this mental progression of Ines exceptionally\nwell. There is no doubt that\nthe two leads carry this film\nand make it the masterpiece\nit is and this was recognised\nby them both winning Best\nActor and Actress for their\nroles at the European Film\nAwards 2016.\nToni Erdmann, despite\nbeing nearly three hours\nlong, is a gem of a film.\nIt\u2019s a comedy, with thought\nand tenderness and is one\nto watch. And if you\u2019re put\noff by the subtitles, you\ncan wait for the recently\nannounced remake with\nJack Nicholson and Kristen\nWigg. But we all know how\nthose turn out.\nMeryl Anil\nSight&Sound\u2019s Best Film of 2016, Toni\nErdmann follows the attempts of a\nfather attempting to reconnect with\nhis estranged daugher, with a perfect\nmixture of hilarity and sincerity\nthe chaos.\nToni Erdmann, despite\nits title, evolves into a film\njust as much about Ines\nas it is about Toni. Ines is\nportrayed to be an intelli-gent, strong-willed woman,\nwho has risen above the\nchallenge of her seemingly 24 hour corporate\nlifestyle, which involves\nhaving to constantly please\nher boss, her clients and\napparently their wives. She\nis a machine, balancing all\nthese tasks seamlessly and\nbeing constantly under-mined, an issue observed\nby most women in the\nmale-dominated business\nworld. However, Ines is\nshown to be, or at least\nshown to pretend to be,\noblivious to this issue of\nsexism and on questioned\non whether she was a\nfeminist, even states \u201cI am\n\\\\ Komplizen Film\nTONI\nERDMANN\nit\u2019s hard to imagine that\nsuch a film is not the talk of\nthe town during its release\ngiven the astounding hype\nprocured by other singing\nand dancing counterparts.\nToni Erdmann follows\nthe hilarious yet touching attempts of a father,\nWinfred Conradi (Peter\nSimonischek), to reconnect\nwith his estranged daughter Ines Conradi (Sandra\nH\u00fcller). Winfred, a divorced\nmusic teacher is shown to\nlive a quiet life that consists\nof a steady dose of silly\npranks played on anyone\nand everyone. But after\nhis last student drops out\nand his dog dies, Winfred\ndecides to take his pranks\nto his daughter in Bucharest\nhoping to rekindle their\nrelationship, much to the\ndismay of Ines.\nAfter the initial visit succeeded in nothing except\ndisrupting Ines\u2019s busy corporate life as a management\nconsultant, Winfred leaves\nInes only to re-infiltrate her\nlife as Toni Erdmann, the\nlife coach of Ines\u2019s boss.\nInes, rising to the challenge allows him to play\nout his prank. Director Ade\nexplained \u201cHumour is often\na way of coping with things,\nnot a feminist or I wouldn\u2019t\ntolerate guys like you\u201d. She\nconsiders herself an equal\nand acts that way, which\nleads her to seem cold and\nunapproachable, having\nto constantly fight against\nthese pressures and emphasise her presence. This\npressure undoubtedly takes\nits toll and the added complication of having to deal\nwith her father\u2019s presence\nresults in her losing control\nof her perfectly manicured\nlife leading to several phenomenal scenes including\nan amazing rendition of\nThe Greatest Love of All by\nWhitney Houston and leading up to the confusing yet\nabsolutely brilliant birthday\nbrunch scene.\nFor a film whose humour is\nimplied through the inability\nof Winfred to act as Toni,\nthis puts Peter Simonischek,\nincredible as he is, in a\ntough situation. However,\nas the film\u2019s accolades have\nshown, it was to great suc-cess. Simonischek was able\nto capture the awkwardness\nof the whole situation, whilst\nnot making it completely\nso, allowing for moments of\ncalm and sincerity. Sandra\nH\u00fcller too embodied the\ncareer driven Ines perfectly.\nOne could think of the\nentire film as a journey of\nself-realisation for Ines,\naided by Toni. And H\u00fcller\n\\\\ Winfred uses\ncomedy as his\n\u2018weapon\u2019 to\nreconnect with Ines\nas he tries to soften\nher rigid life, and\nremind her to allow\ntime to breathe. \\\\\n\\\\ Throughout the\nfilm the two are seen\nto battle each other\nto find a middle\nground for both\ntheir outlooks on life,\namidst the chaos. \\\\\n\\\\ Soda Pictures\n\\\\ Komplizen Film\n\n"

The spring rolls each\ncame with different sauces\nwhich complemented their\ninsides. They were cooked\nwell, hot on the inside, crispy\non the outside. Standard\nspring rolls. The sesame\ncrackers tasted a bit like stale\nbread with the texture of a\ncracker. I didn\u2019t like them\nmuch because I prefer prawn\ncrackers. But if you\u2019re veg-etarian, like my friend who\nshot-gunned the last one, I\nfeel like you\u2019ll like them a lot.\nThe dough was interesting.\nIt wasn\u2019t really crispy, more\nchewy. The sweet satay sauce\nmade it taste more like a dessert than a starter. It definitely\nfelt like street food, and was\nkind of like I was eating Indonesian churros.\nFor mains, my friends all got\nstir fry combos. The combo\ncame with nutty papaya\nsalad, flavoured rice and\ncornballs, so it\u2019s worth paying\nfor the upgrade. They said\nit was really good. Not very\ndescriptive of them, but at\nleast they were happy.\nI couldn\u2019t decide which\nmeat to get in my Laksa soup,\nso I got them all. Getting\na superior combo meant\nmy massive bowl of soupy\nnoodles came with prawn,\nfishballs, beef, chicken and\nvegetables. It had a good\nbalance of sweetness from the\ncoconut milk and sourness,\nShanzeh Khurshid\nprobably from the fish sauce\nand lime juice. They gave it a\nred chilli symbol on the menu,\nbut it only had a hint of spice\nto me. Nonetheless it was\nflavourful and really filled me\nup. I packed away most of\nit for my lunch the next day.\nMy friends finished their food,\nbut at the cost of waddling\ninstead of walking to the bus\nstop.\nBecause we had tastecards,\nthe bill came to about \u00a310\nper person, which I think is\na really good deal given\nthe quality and size of our\nstarter and main. As well as\nthat, before 19:30 it\u2019s happy\nhour(s) so drinks are half\nprice too! It did take ages\nto pay, as there was some\nproblem in the kitchen. The\nwaiter apologised profusely\nthough, which made it better\nbecause they recognised we\nwere inconvenienced.\nIt\u2019s good when a restaurant\nserves good tasting food, but\nhere the food was so much\nmore than just that. It was\nmemorable. Every dish had a\n\\\\ The sweet satay\nsauce made it taste\nmore like a dessert\nthan a starter. It\ndefinitely felt like\nstreet food, and was\nkind of like I was\neating Indonesian\nchurros \\\\\n\\\\ I couldn\u2019t decide\nwhich meat to get in\nmy Laksa soup, so I\ngot them all \\\\ strong unique flavour, rather\nthan all the food having the\nsame base taste. There was a\nwide range of options on the\nmenu, so it does cater across\nthe spectrum for people who\nare fussy and like simple\ntastes, as well as those who\nlike trying new complex\nflavours. It\u2019s a chain so there\nare branches all over London\nmaking it easily accessible. I\nwould definitely recommend\ngoing, I\u2019ve already been\nagain twice since!\nFirst Impressions?\nFrom the minute we walked in the staff were very welcoming and sat us at\na spacious table with benches. The seating along with exposed brick walls,\nand soft low-hanging lighting gave it a very chilled out vibe, like a beach\nhut fused with a modern restaurant. The ambience certainly was in line with\ntheir contemporary Indochinese theme.\nOrdering took about 20 minutes, because there was just so much choice!\nOur waitress brought us five different menus: main menu, vegetarian menu,\ndrinks menu, desserts menu, specials menu, and on the menus themselves\nthere were symbols identifying if dishes are vegan, vegan but with eggs,\ngluten free, halal, recommended, spiciness levels, etc. After I attempted\nto decipher these hieroglyphics, read all the menus, and remember\neverything, I just asked the waitress for help. She had knowledge, which\nwas good because it\u2019s such a let-down if the staff do not know about the\nfood themselves.\nWhere did you go?\nOn their way to the Royal Albert Hall, my friends and I caught\nup in Banana Tree in Bayswater. I suggested the restaurant\nbecause it\u2019s about 30 minutes walking distance from campus,\nand only 20 minutes from Wilson House and Pembridge. Ever\nsince she went on a yoga trip to Vietnam, one of my friends\nhas become a die-hard fan of far eastern cuisine. To appease\nher, I suggested this place as they claim to serve contemporary\nIndochinese food, and I thought it would be a nice change from\nthe traditional Chinese takeout we normally get.\n\\\\ There was a wide\nrange of options on\nthe menu, so it does\ncater across the\nspectrum for people\nwho are fussy and\nlike simple tastes,\nas well as those\nwho like trying new\ncomplex flavours \\\\\n\n"

Across the eight\nshorts, we are catapulted\nfrom one corner of the globe\nto the next, dealing with\nculture. Zheng\u2019s animation is\nbeautiful and haunting, filled\nwith exquisite images: agricultural workers swishing scythes\nthrough fields of wheat;\nchildren running through\nChinese characters; Zheng\nherself folding paper cranes\nat a kitchen table. The result is\na small masterpiece, which is\nmoving in its simplicity.\nThe other two nominees\nin the Best Animation category have a more complex\nanimation style, but lack\nthe emotional nuance of\nTough. In A Love Story,\ndirected by Anushka Kishani\nNaanayakkara, two strange\nwoollen creatures build up a\nrelationship through lengths\nof coloured string, which\nbind them together. Over a\nsoundtrack of ambient sounds\nand plucking thumb pianos,\nthe two woollen heads float\nthrough a disconcerting\nworld of fluff, with slightly\nmenacing, almost Lynchian\nundertones. Jack Clinch\u2019s\nThe Alan Dimension, mean-while, brings things back\nto reality with a charming\ntale about a suburban man\nwho can predict the future,\nonly everything he predicts\nis completely banal. Alan\u2019s\nobsession with this foresight\nthreatens to break him apart\nfrom his wife, but \u2013 of course\n\u2013 everything turns out alright\nin the end. The animation\nhere consists of cartoon\nanimation against a backdrop\nof model interiors, and the\noverall effect is really quite\noff-putting, detracting from\nthe film\u2019s plot.\nFred Fyles\nThe shortlist of BAFTA nominees\nfor Best British Short Film and\nAnimation are daring in their\nscope, but the quality of some\nleaves a little to be desired\nthe weakest short of the selec-tion, and its storyline is trite.\nMouth of Hell attempts to\nundertake a complete narrative within under 15 minutes,\nwhich is \u2013 evidently \u2013 easy\nto do badly. It\u2019s a problem\nthat runs through most of the\nnominees, with only Standby\nmanaging to balance things\nwell.\nThis difficulty with narrative\nis perhaps the reason why\nthe best nominee for British\nShort Film is a documentary\nrather than a piece of fiction.\nRichard John Seymour\u2019s Consumed takes us on a journey\nthrough the modern means\nof production, taking us on a\nnear-wordless tour of China\u2019s\nmanufacturing industry. Starting with shots of landscapes\nand mines, Seymour shows\nus the vast environmental\ndestruction caused by human\ngreed, before exploring factories which produce goods\nfor Western countries. A\nworker tells us that October is\nthe busiest time at the factory\nbecause of the Western holi-days, foreshadowing the fact\nthat the consumables being\nproduced, rather than the\ntraditional images of computers or iPhones, are actually\nnovelty Christmas items, that\nwill probably be thrown away\nbefore the year is out. Comparable with Zhao Liang\u2019s\nBehemoth and Jia Zhangke\u2019s\nA Touch of Sin, Consumed\npowerfully questions the\nimpact consumption is having\non the planet, both in environmental and human terms.\nDelicate, austere framing is\njuxtaposed against the sheer\nhorror of what we are being\nshown, in a manner reminiscent of the photographs of\nSabasti\u00e3o Salgado.\nJennifer Zheng\u2019s Tough also\ncentres around China, but in\nher animation it is China as filtered through the experience\nof her mother, who grew up\nduring the Cultural Revolution, and Zheng herself, who\nwas born in Britain. Drawing\non the misunderstandings and\nmiscommunications that have\ninevitably developed as a\nresult of the two women experiencing the world through\ntwo different mind-sets and\nlanguages, Tough explores\nissues of race, identity, and\nJennifer Zheng\u2019s Tough is a moving portrait of family \\\\ Jennifer Zheng\nBritish short\nfilms take us\naround the\nglobe\nthemes both big and small.\nOne of the most engaging\nfilms, however, deals with\nthe instantly-recognisable\ninstitution of the British police\nforce: Charlotte Regan\u2019s\nStandby takes place entirely\nin a police car, with all shots\ntaken from the same angle.\nAndrew Paul and Alexa\nMorden play the officers,\nand we join them on a\nwhistle-stop tour of birthdays,\nbreakdowns, and promotions,\npunctuated by hilarious\nsequences of the two cops\nrapping along to Skepta.\nIt\u2019s not the most profound\nof pieces, but it\u2019s lively and\namusing.\nThe Party, on the other\nhand, deals with darker mat-ters. From the initial title card\ntelling us it\u2019s set in Belfast at\nthe height of the troubles, we\nknow that something bad is\nsoon going to happen. And\nindeed, it soon does: a group\nof adolescents celebrate in\na small house, and a fugitive\nwho plans on sneaking over\nthe border has managed to\nsneak into the party to see his\nfriends, unknowingly placing\nthem all in great danger. With\nits heavy patina of 1970s\ntones, and shocking violence,\nThe Party is a commitment to\nBritish realism.\nHome, from director\nDaniel Mulloy, is probably\nthe most-publicised film of\nthe nominees. Released on\nWorld Refugee Day, Home\nshows a British family making\na perilous journey from\ntheir comfortable home life\nto a war-zone, in a form of\nreverse migration. Initially,\nthe short resembles an\nadvertisement for Renault,\nbut things shortly take a\nturn for the worse. Mulloy is\ngood at initially building up\na sense of unease, but this\ndoesn\u2019t continue until the end,\nand once the audience has\ngrasped the concept of the\nshort, it doesn\u2019t seem to have\nmuch impact: it\u2019s unclear how\nthe short is supposed to make\nus any more sympathetic with\nthose fleeing across Europe,\nespecially compared to the\nharrowing real-life footage\nthat has been present on\nthe news for the last twelve\nmonths.\nSamir Mehanovic\u2019s Mouth\nof Hell similarly tries to evoke\nthe viewer\u2019s sympathy, telling\nthe story of a boy with a sick\nmother who is growing up in\nJharia, India, on the surface\nof a giant underground\ncoal seam fire. Mouth of\nHell, which mines (pun not\nintended) the stereotypical\nimage of Indian poverty, is\n\\\\ Jennifer Zheng\u2019s\nanimation is\nbeautiful and\nhaunting, filled with\nexquisite images:\nagricultural workers\nswishing scythes\nthrough fields\nof wheat, while\nchildren running\nthrough Chinese\ncharacters \\\\\n\n"

As a series trying to\nportray a different side of the\nrelationships between man\nand woman, how does it stack\nup?\nB\nuilt from the ground\nup by creator Alicia\nJ. Rose, this series\nof ten-ish minute\nshorts chronicles\nthe ever-evolving\nrelationship between\n40-something Oregonite\nJackie, and her so-called\n\u2018gay husband\u2019, River. Now,\nto the uninitiated (as I was)\nthis may conjure up images\nof cringe-worthy sitcom\nshenanigans. Rather, what we\nget is an often genuine and\nfrequently heartfelt attempt\nat eschewing the traditional\nrelationship paradigms one\nfinds on TV.\nCertainly, it is tempting to\ndraw comparisons between\nBenefits and the seminal 90s\nsitcom, Will & Grace. While\nthere are certainly echoes of\nthe central protagonists of\nthat series to be found here,\nGusbandry strives to go one\nstep further by aiming for\ngreater authenticity in its portrayals of its gay characters,\nand by trying to stray away\nfrom some of the stereotypes\nshows like Will & Grace\nsometimes slipped into. On\nthis front, it hits more than it\nmisses.\n\u201cMen crave women in their\nlife, and women crave men\nin their life, but it doesn\u2019t\nhave to be in a heteronor-mative way. Relationships\nthat are founded and thrive\non alliance, acceptance and\nlove \u2013 that\u2019s really important\u201d\nsays Rose in an interview with\nOut Magazine, distilling the\nmission statement of the show\ninto one sentence. Interestingly, this is Rose\u2019s first major\nsuch project. Having previously worked on music videos\nand as a photographer, Rose\nclaims to have based facets\nof the show on her own\nexperiences. River himself is\nsaid to be modelled after her\nlong-time friend and LGBT\nactivist Lake Perriguey; who\nalso happens to be Oregon\u2019s\nfirst non-binary individual. As\nsuch, Rose has made clear\nthat it was always very important for her to have an actual\ngay man playing River.\nThe series itself starts out at\nJackie\u2019s 40th\nbirthday party,\nquickly setting up her char-acter. She\u2019s jaded, witty, and\nwith a trail of bad relationships behind her; in short, a\ntypically trope heavy sitcom\nprotagonist. It\u2019s here she\nmeets River, initially not realising he\u2019s gay and developing\na crush on him. Thankfully,\nthis misunderstanding is\nrapidly cleared up, and what\nfollows is a series of snapshots of different stages of\ntheir friendship.\nBrooke Totman does an\namicable job as Jackie,\nespecially considering that\nnot all her material is stellar.\nThe real star of the show,\nhowever, is Kurt Conroyd as\nRiver. He effuses charm, and\nthe chemistry between him\nand Totman drives the show.\nIt makes the more heartfelt\nmoments of the series feel all\nthe more genuine.\nIn tone, The Benefits of\nGusbandry is not at all osten-tatious, instead opting for\na more down-to-earth vibe.\nThis certainly helps it feel\nrealistic, although sometimes\ngratingly so. In addition,\nwhile the humour is generally\ngood, jokes do fall flat a\nnot-insignificant proportion\nof the time. Most of these are\nconcentrated towards\nthe beginning of\nthe series,\nhowever,\nas the\nshow\nhas\n\\\\ An often genuine and frequently\nheartfelt attempt at\neschewing traditional relationship para-digms\\\\\nNeed someone to enable junk food\nbinges\\\\ The Benefits of Gusbandry\nLLC\nsome teething troubles. The\naforementioned character\ninteractions are likeable\nenough, however, that the\nseries managed to hold my\ninterest despite these hurdles.\nFrustratingly, however, the\nshow fumbles slightly in its\nfinal episode. Not only does it\nopt for a cliff-hanger ending,\nwhich wouldn\u2019t be so bad on\nits own, but it also annoyingly\nopts for a classic \u2018misunderstanding\u2019 plot. This agonises\nI wish my sunglasses could do that\\\\ The Benefits of Gusbandry\nLLC\nthe viewer and just makes it\nfeel like a waste of time.\nWhile The Benefits of\nGusbandry certainly mixes\nthings up, and strives to show\nthe under-represented sides\nof the gay community, it still\nkeeps a somewhat limited\nperspective; falling into the\nmajority of white male gay\ncharacters found in TV.\nAll things considered, The\nBenefits of Gusbandry is\na great show, especially\nmaking concessions for its\nlength, and the fact that this\nis creator Alicia Rose\u2019s first\nmajor project. While the\ncomedy isn\u2019t always perfect,\nit strives to be, and its efforts\nto broaden the views of the\ngay community typically\nfound on TV must be\nappreciated.\n\\\\It also annoyingly\nopts for a classic\n\u2018misunderstanding\u2019\nplot.

    "content": "32 felixonline.co.uk/millennials millennials.felix@ic.ac.uk Friday 10 February 2017\nfelix M I L L E N N I A L S\nShouldtheTbedroppedfromLGBT?\nElizabeth Windo goes over a brief history of the T movement and discusses the place of\ntransgender people within the queer community\nI\nt\u2019s easy to look from\nthe outside at a pride\nparade and see a unified\ngrouping of similarly\nminded people. But\nunder this facade of\ntogetherness, within the LGBT\ncommunity lies a volatile\nmixture of groups that\nsometimes have radically\ndifferent goals. An example\nof this is the recent push that\nhas led some, particularly\nfrom outside the trans\ncommunity, to question the\nplace of the T in LGBT.\nThe \u2018Drop the T\u2019 ideology\noriginally appeared on\nthe website change.org. It\ncommunity.\nSince then, many other\nresponses have also questioned the \u2018different ideology\u2019\nposition. While it may be true\nthat sexuality differs from\ngender identity, the LGBT\ncommunity has historically\nbeen linked due to shared\ndiscrimination and oppression based on their attributes\nrather than being grouped by\nthose attributes themselves. To\nuse an analogy - \u2018knives are\ndifferent from forks but we\nstill call them cutlery\u2019. There\nis also an overlap between\nthe groups \u2013 it is not an\nexaggeration to say that most\nof the trans community would\nfall under the LGB umbrella if\nthey were divided. If someone\nwas assigned female at birth,\nbut has always exclusively\ndated men, if they come\nout as trans and are treated\nby society as male, society\nwould view that relationship\nas a gay one. If they exclusively dated women, it is likely\nthat they would have had significant formative experiences\nin the lesbian community\nbefore transitioning fully \u2013 is\nit fair or reasonable to deny\nthem access to that common\nspace simply because society\nnow treats them as straight?\nThe waters become further\nmuddied with non-binary\nidentities \u2013 what would\nconstitute straight in that case\nanyway?\nWhile the petition has\nbeen met by widespread\ncriticism, the movement\nhas gained some support\nfrom several trans people.\nSupporters believe that\nwhile the community should\nremain united, campaigning\nfor rights should be done\nseparately. The motivation for\nthis is that campaigning that\nfocuses explicitly on the trans\ncommunity is more likely to\nachieve meaningful progress\nlikely to live with a yearly\nincome of less than ten thousand dollars per year.\nThe origin of this petition is\nunclear, but the movement still\ncrops up and has been associated with several prominent\nright wing media personali-ties, many of which are LGBT\nthemselves, such as Milo Yiannopoulis. Some trans people\nhave criticised this as nothing\nbut \u2018respectability politics\u2019,\nthe need to distinguish the\nparts of the community that\nhave received some societal\nacceptance with those who\nare treated less well, and who\nunder the pretext of wanting\nto help trans people on the\ncondition that they do not\ninfringe on women\u2019s rights.\nAt other times, it takes a\nmore aggressive slant, with\nmany public-facing trans\npeople reporting significant\nonline harassment from this\ndemographic. Regardless of\nthe way in which it is carried\nout, the ultimate goal of many\nsuch \u2018gender critical feminists\u2019\nis to exclude trans people\nfrom LGBT and women\u2019s\nspaces, in the same fashion as\nthe original petition.\nIf there are any hard facts\nto be gained from this, it is\nthat the LGBT community is\nnot monolithic. There is no\nsingle right answer adopted\nby every member, there is\nno homogenised belief about\nwhat is the correct course\nof action in every situation.\nGiven the current political\nclimate however, it is the\nbelief of many, including the\nGLAAD president, Sarah\nEllis, that it is more important\nto focus on unity than refining\nan existing grouping. In her\nreply to the original petition,\nshe concluded with the follow-ing. \u2018At a time when anti-LGBT\nactivists continue to attack the\nbasic rights and protections\nessential to all of our lives, we\nmust stand together, rather\nthan succumb to the ruin of\ndivisiveness\u2019.\n\\\\ Within the LGBT\ncommunity lies a\nvolatile mixture\nof groups that\nsometimes have\nradically different\ngoals \\\\\nsuggested that within the\nLGBT community, not only\nwas the \u2018T\u2019 section not a\nmeaningful part of the whole,\nbut that it was fundamentally\nincompatible with the L, the\nG, and the B. The argument\nrested on the fact that the LGB\nrelated to sexuality, whereas\nthe T related to gender identity \u2013 different things entirely.\nThe petition itself lead\nto a quick response and\ndismissal from many people\nincluding the leaders of the\nHuman Rights Campaign and\nGLAAD, a media monitoring organisation founded\nby LGBT people. These two\ngroups were among those\nexplicitly listed in the petition as bodies that should\nstop representing the trans\n\\\\ The LGBT\ncommunity has\nhistorically\nbeen linked\ndue to shared\ndiscrimination and\noppression based\non their attributes\nrather than being\ngrouped by\nthose attributes\nthemselves \\\\\nare currently more controver-sial. While this may be the\ncase, it is important to also\nconsider the historical con-text. The origins of the \u2018drop\nthe T\u2019 can be traced back a\nlong way, back to the days of\nGreer\u2019s radical feminism. Historically, radical feminism has\nhad a significant overlap with\nthe lesbian community, which\nhas considerable social and\nacademic influence. Various\nradical feminist speakers have\nquestioned the legitimacy of\nsomeone assigned one sex\nidentifying as another. At\ntimes, this criticism is done\nthan one that targets the\nentire umbrella. However,\norganisations such as the\nHuman Rights Campaign\nhave criticised the allegations\nthat the focus of campaigning and support is not on the\ntrans community where it is\nappropriate. Splitting the\nfocus would at best change\nnothing, and at worst deprive\nthe transgender community of\nvaluable platforms, numbers,\nand resources. Estimates\nplace between 0.1% and\n0.5% of the population as\npart of the trans community,\nmany of whom may live in\npoverty and are unable to\nspend their time on activism.\nAn investigation by the\nCenter for American Progress\nfound that on average trans\nand gender non-conforming\npeople are three times more\n\\\\Various radical\nfeminist speakers\nhave questioned\nthe legitimacy of\nsomeone assigned\none sex identifying\nas another \\\\\nLGBT+\nT\nT\nT\nT\n\n"

The sensitive nature\nof the discussion had clearly\nbeen recognised by felix,\nand was therefore covered\nappropriately.\nSadly, however, on closer\ninspection, it became clear\nthat the article was riddled\nwith misrepresentations of the\nreality of the situation. I was\nleft feeling that journalistic\nintegrity had been sacrificed\nfor the sake of attention-grabbing quotes.\nTo begin with, the extracts\nchosen for emphasis in the\narticle did a disservice not\n\\\\ Implying mutual\nresponsibility for the\nprotests-turned-violent-mobs that did indeed occur\nis unfair and untrue \\\\\nonly to the truth, but also to\nthe content of the article. The\nfirst extract, \u201cthe ambassador\nlikely visited Imperial as part\nof Israel\u2019s wider anti-BDS\n(Boycott, Divestment and\nSanctions) strategy,\u201d is more\nthan a bit strange. Would the\nauthor expect other countries\u2019\nambassadors not to oppose\ncampaigns to boycott the\ncountries they represent?\nThe other extract poses an\neven greater issue. \u201cIt is quite\nworrying that the College did\nnot think to invite an opposing\nview to help balance the\nconversation themselves. This\nwould\u2019ve lead to a much more\nopen-minded and fruitful\ndiscussion.\u201d\nThis direct quote from\nthe representative of\nthe Palestinian Society\nis, categorically, a lie. I\npersonally have two forms\nof written proof that the\nPalestinian Society was\ncontacted, by Dr Wraith as\nwell as the Israeli Society,\nduring the early stages of\nplanning the event as far back\nas October. Furthermore, the\nfact that the quote was false\nshould not be used to mislead\nreaders \u2013 intentionally or\notherwise.\nMoreover, both the\nAmbassador and Dr\nWraith said very clearly\nduring the visit that the\nPalestinian counterpart to\nthe Israeli Ambassador,\nManuel Hassassian, would\nbe welcome to speak at\nImperial. As this talk was\npredominantly the initiative\nof the Israeli Embassy,\nthis criticism of the event\norganisers would instead be\nbetter directed at Manuel\nHassassian, who would have\nbeen more than able to take\nthe same initiative.\nMoving on to the rest of the\nquote in the bulk of article:\n\u201c\u2026Further still, the fact that\nthe event was not publicised\nproperly\u2026 is, in itself,\ndisheartening.\u201dPublicityofthe\nevent was a matter of security\nfollowing recommendations\nby the police. I do not see\nany reason that the limited\npublicity would have caused\nbias or swayed attendance \u2013\nneither the Israeli Society nor\nthe Jewish Society publicly\nadvertised it, yet the event\nwas sold out.\nIt would be heartening if\nsuch security measures were\nnot necessary, but as the\narticle helpfully pointed out,\nthe police were anxious to\navoid a repeat of last year\u2019s\nevents at King\u2019s College and\nUCL.\nBut to say that \u201cprotestors on\nboth sides clashed at events\nwith pro-Israel speakers\u201d is\nmisleading. Implying mutual\nresponsibility for the protests-turned-violent-mobs that did\nindeed occur is unfair and\nuntrue. The violence and\nintimidation at these \u2018clashes\u2019\nwas instigated entirely by\nprotesters attempting to shut\ndown free speech \u2013 it takes\nonly a cursory glance at the\nample smartphone footage to\nverify this. On both occasions,\na police escort was required\nto enable attendees to leave\nthe location of the talk.\nMy attention was also drawn\nto two points in the article\nwhere the Ambassador\u2019s\narguments were unfairly cut\nshort. The first relates to the\nsection of the article about\nmutual recognition and the\nPeel Partition. Despite my\nutmost respect for Dr Wraith,\nthe assumption that his\nrebuttal was the final word on\nthe matter is misleading. The\nAmbassador never claimed\nthat the Zionist Commission\naccepted the Peel Partition\nplan, as Dr Wraith\u2019s comment\nimplies. He said that the\nIsraelis accepted the principle\nof partition, while the Arabs\ndid not. The important fact\nthat the article leaves out is\nthat the Zionist Commission\nempowered its executive to\nnegotiate more favourable\nborders, but did not outright\nrejecttheprincipleofpartition.\nThe Palestinian Arab reaction,\nhowever, was to reject the\nprinciple in its entirety.\nThe other point relates to\nthe Ambassador\u2019s view of the\nUN: \u201cEveryone agrees at the\nUN it\u2019s always Israel\u2019s fault.\u201d\nEnding the discussion there\ndisregards what he later went\non to point out: \u201ceveryone\u201d\nincludes the two previous UN\nSecretary-Generals, Ban Kimoon and Kofi Annan, the\nformer saying that \u201cDecades\nof political maneuvering have\ncreated a disproportionate\nnumber of resolutions, reports\nand committees against\nIsrael.\u201d\nWith all this being said, I\nthank felix for covering such\nan important topic, and for\ndoing so far more fairly than\nis often the case. We should\nbe proud that such difficult,\nyet important discussion can\ntake place so respectfully\nat Imperial. I look forward\nto hearing from Manuel\nHassassian, and hope that\nconstructive dialogue can\ncontinue in such a productive\nand respectful manner.\n\\\\ This direct\nquote from the\nrepresentative of the\nPalestinian Society\nis, categorically, a\nlie. I personally have\ntwo forms of written\nproof \\\\\n\\\\ The extracts\nchosen for emphasis\nin the article did a\ndisservice not only\nto the truth, but also\nto the content of the\narticle \\\\\nThe NHS has no\nidea what it's doing\nwhen it comes to\ntrans patients\nAn anonymous writer discusses the\nNHS's complete failure to address the\nneeds of transgender patients\nO\nne of the most\ndisconcerting\nt h i n g s\nyou can\nexperience\nwhen visiting\nthe doctor is seeing your GP\nopen up Internet Explorer and\nstart googling. As a nervous\ntransgender teenager, I was\ncompletely terrified. GPs\nare meant to be a first point\nof contact for the general\npopulation; somebody we\nturn to for answers, not more\nquestions. But for transgender\npeople, a lack of knowledge\nby doctors is to be expected.\nHowever, a few minutes\nand a few searches later (no\ndoubt more training on trans\nissues than she had received in\nher entire career) my GP felt\nenough of an authority on the\nsubject to recommend a swift\nand decisive course of action.\nThat action? Absolutely\nnothing; according to a\ncursory browse of the internet,\nas well as a couple of pages\nfrom a book, she determined\nthat the NHS could not treat\nme until I was eighteen years\nold. Many trans people have\nsuch problems getting a\nreferral to a Gender Identity\nClinic (GIC).\n\\\\ For transgender people,\na lack of knowledge is to be\nexpected \\\\\nAlthough the NHS does\nin fact accept transgender\npatients of all ages, I didn't\nknow this \u2013 I had no idea\nthat much of what I had been\ntold was completely false. I\nreturned to the GP one year\nlater to claim my golden ticket:\na referral to the Charing Cross\nGender Identity Clinic. Frankly\nspeaking, I was mentally very\nunwell but still optimistic for\nthe future.\nHowever, things were not\ngoing to be that simple. The\ntime from referral to first\nappointment at the Charing\nCross GIC is currently\nestimated at twelve months\n\u2013 I personally had to wait\ncloser to 18 months. To make\nmatters worse, the length of\ntime people spend on waiting\nlists is increasing. Patients\nat Charing Cross are being\ndischarged at roughly half the\nrate they are being received.\nClinics in places like Leeds\nhave estimated waiting times\nof up to four years. Either\nway, it is a far cry indeed from\nthe imposed legal limit of 18\nweeks.\nApproximately two and\na half years after the first\ntime I visited the GP, with\nextremely poor mental health,\nI\u2019m able to attend my initial\nappointment at the GIC. The\nclinic itself, having acquired\na slightly magical quality\nin my imagination over the\nyears, struck me as bland\nand inconspicuous. Although\nlocated above a Sainsbury\u2019s\noutside the official bounds\nof the hospital, it serves the\nentirety of London as well\nas approximately half of\nEngland. A waiting list of over\na thousand people, and I had\nfinally made it!\nHaving now registered\nat a certain nearby health\ncentre, more roadblocks for\nmy gender transition readily\nappeared. The failure of my\nGP to monitor the levels of\nsex hormones in my blood for\nsix months, until I personally\nintervened, was one of them.\nNot only is such casual\nnegligence a problem for\ntransgender people, but some\nGPs may outright refuse to\nprescribe some medication\nrequired by a Gender Identity\nClinic, claiming that it is too\nexpensive.\nAlthough problems like\nthese are no doubt intolerable\nfor cisgender patients, it\nhas become the norm for\ntransgender people. In\nparticular, there is the need to\nessentially infantilise your GP,\n\\\\ I had no idea\nthat much of what I\nhad been told was\ncompletely false\\\\\n\\\\ For a\ndemographic with\nan attempted suicide\nrate of almost 40%,\nthe NHS displays\nlittle urgency when\ntreating transgender\npatients \\\\\nas you have to assume they\nhave zero knowledge in trans\nhealthcare. You have to find\nout from other trans people\non the internet (nobody else\nis available to help you) and\ntell your GP the best way to\ntreat you, because they will\nnot know.\nI find myself looking at the\nfourth anniversary of that\nfirst visit to the GP in the\nsummer later this year. With\nmy dosage being increased\nand my blood levels being\nmonitored properly, hopefully\nI will be on the correct dosage\nof hormones by the time that\nday comes.\nFor a demographic with\nan attempted suicide rate of\nalmost 40%, the NHS displays\nlittle urgency when treating\ntransgender patients.

Whatever path you\nchoose, good or bad, there\nare only so many possible\nendings and deviations from\nthe story you can have. But\nhonestly, so what? There\u2019s a\nV\nideo games are\nunique from\nTV shows and\nmovies due to\nthe sense of\nimmersion they\ngive players. Having the\nability to make choices plays\na large part in this. It\u2019s not\njust any old story you get to\nexperience, it\u2019s one chosen\nand defined by you and that\u2019s\nwhat makes it all the more\nintimate.\nOf course, virtual\nchoices aren\u2019t exactly as\nopen ended as you might\nimagine. Considering how\nmany games rely on the\ndo. But in retrospect isn\u2019t\nreal life like that as well?\nWe\u2019re restricted by the constraints of society, the laws\nof physics and what not. It\u2019s\nall for our own good but it\u2019s\nstill limiting to a degree.\nSome game choices are\nbullshit to be fair. Like when\nyou confront a boss and it\nasks you not to fight it but\ninstead rule with it. Say no\nand you begin the final boss\nfight, say yes and it\u2019s game\nover. But such things belong\nin the past, and more recent\ngames have more profound\nchoices where there\u2019s never\nreally an easy way out.\nIt\u2019s accepted that there\nare a number of check-boxes a video game choice\nneeds to tick off to be truly\nworth including. You need\nto be aware of all other\nchoices, you shouldn\u2019t have\nthe opportunity to remake\na choice, and you should\nconstantly be reminded of\nthe choice you made and\nfeel the repercussions from\nit. The games developed\nby Telltale Games are\nparticularly well known\nfor getting all these factors\nright. For example, in one\npart of The Walking Dead\ngame, you\u2019re attacked\nby zombies and have the\noption of saving either one\nof two characters. You can\nsee both of them clearly\nand both of them are nice\nenough that you\u2019d rather\nsave them both. The game\ntailors itself around your\ndecision, maybe not enough\nto make it a substantial\nlimit to how much programmers can actually code.\nAnd the true fun of choice\nis the happiness and thrill\nyou get in that moment.\nIt\u2019s never really about the\nending, it\u2019s always about\nthe journey and how you\nget there. If you really want\nto go beyond what the\ngame will allow you, then\ngo play a tabletop RPG.\nOften, the choices are\nbetween generic \u2018good\u2019 and\n\u2018bad\u2019 choices, usually with\nthe added catch that the\nevil choices are much more\nfun. For example, if you\u2019ve\nplayed Star Wars: Knights\nof the Old Republic, playing\non the dark side is always\nmuch more enjoyable.\nHeck, in the sequel, the\ndark side\u2019s plans actually\nmakes sense. A lot of other\ngames like Bioshock have\nchoices like this; do you\nsave the little girl or kill her\nand get more powers?\nThese days, there\u2019s no\nright or wrong choice, just\na large mix of morally grey\nones, which honestly is a bit\nlike real life. There\u2019s never\nreally a right or wrong\nanswer, you can never satisfy everyone, you just have\nto do what seems right to\nyou. This adds another layer\nof complexity to gaming,\nand lets you look into yourself and see how you would\nreact in certain situations.\nThis gives gaming an edge\nLeft or right?\nwhich other forms of media\ndon\u2019t have. You don\u2019t see\nsome person\u2019s version of\nhow things are, you see\nyour version and how you\nwant things to go.\nChoice, as much as it\u2019s\nprogrammed in, is the\ndefining feature of games\nas a medium. By giving\nplayers control, games\ncan intimately engage with\ntheir audience and implicate them in deep moral\nchoices or make them feel\npowerless. With this level of\nimmersion, it\u2019s no wonder\nwe keep coming back to\nplaying video games.\n\\\\ These days,\nthere\u2019s no right or\nwrong choice, just a\nlarge mix of morally\ngrey ones \\\\\nchoices you make, there\u2019s a\nlimit to how much you can\nactually do. The first major\nrestriction is, of course, the\ngame\u2019s programming. You\ncan\u2019t do anything that the\ngame doesn\u2019t allow you to\nNever easy to make a choice, but you still have to do it \\\\ Micolo J\n\n"

This was\na key campaign pledge,\nand, although more crudely\nproposed as a total ban on\nall Muslims, he was largely\nignored at the time as an\negotistical idiot who had\nshouted his way into the\nRepublican candidacy, and\nwhose opinions would have\nlittle actual impact on US\nforeign policy. Now that he\nis in power, a much greater\nglobal response to the policy\nhas formed, propelling,\nalmost symbolically, the cause\nof inclusion against division.\nAt the time of writing, 1.3\nmillion people have signed a\npetition urging this government\nto either postpone or cancel\nthe State visit of Donald\nTrump, as the US President,\nto the UK. Many prominent\n(although inexplicably so)\npoliticians have endorsed this\ncall. Jeremy Corbyn stated\nthat \"Donald Trump should not\nbe welcomed to Britain while\nhe abuses our shared values\nwith his shameful Muslim ban\nand attacks on refugees' and\nwomen's rights\"\nI find this rhetoric, from\ncitizen and politician alike,\nan insidious example of\nraging liberal hypocrisy to\na degree it has hardly yet\n\\\\ Ignoring problems and\npeople does not make them\ngo away \\\\\nseen. I have no problem with\nprotesting a policy with which\nyou do not agree, either at\nhome or abroad. However,\nrequesting disengagement\nentirely is an eminently stupid\nsuggestion \u2013 we do not have\na policy of ignoring people\nwith whom we disagree, but\nengaging with them, raising\nour concerns and creating\nan open dialogue so as to\nbuild stronger relationships\nwith them. This was evident\namongst the liberal camp in\nthe recent US election. Shia\nLaBoeuf, the famous actor,\nstarted a campaign called 'He\nWill Not Divide Us'. People\nadvocated unity, talking to\npeople from different faiths\nand communities to strengthen\nties and unify ambitions.\nSuddenly, however, when\nthe people with different\nviews are people without\nliberal views, the left-wing\nclamours for a total boycott of\nrelationship, communication\nand engagement. This flies\nin the face of the 'values'\nso strongly and sternly\nproclaimed in recent years,\nand, by anyone's estimation, is\nobviously not the way forward\nto incubating global inclusivity\nand freedom. What surprises\nand upsets me most, however,\nis the sheer hypocrisy of\nspearhead figures on the UK\nleft: Jeremy Corbyn shared\na platform with the terrorist\norganisation Hezbollah,\nclearly a divisive group whose\nvalues do not reflect those of\nthe UK. But how did Mr Corbyn\ndefend his actions? He called\nfor engagement and open\nconversation with those with\nwhom we disagree, saying\nthat he was \u201cencouraging\nthem to have a discussion\u201d. In\nfact, the following is a direct\nquote from his spokesperson,\nspeaking about his support\nfor Hamas and Hezbollah,\nboth internationally\nrecognised terrorist, extremist\norganisations:\n\u201c[Corbyn] has met many\npeople with whom he\nprofoundly disagrees in\norder to promote peace and\nreconciliation processes,\nincluding in South Africa,\nLatin American, Ireland and\nthe Middle East. He believes\nit is essential to speak to\npeople with whom there is\ndisagreement, particularly\nwhen they have large-scale\nsupport or democratic\nmandates. Simply talking to\npeople who agree with you\nwon\u2019t help achieve justice or\npeace.\u201d\nInteresting.\nSadiq Khan, Mayor of\nLondon, oddly a labour\npolitician whom I'm somewhat\nsupportive of, also joined the\ncry for a Trump ban, but he\ntoo has stood shoulder to\nshoulder with groups and\nindividuals whose views make\nTrump look like a big orange\nMother Teresa. At one such\nevent, he shared a platform\nwith a Hamas supporter, and\na preacher who backs Islamic\n\\\\ I find this rhetoric\nan insidious example\nof raging liberal\nhypocrisy to a\ndegree it has hardly\nyet seen \\\\\n\\\\ Engagement\nwith other views\nand opinions is\nwhat your hatred of\nTrump is based on \u2013\nfollowing suit makes\nyou, by your own\nestimations, as bad\nas him \\\\\nState. There are few whose\nvalues could be further from\nthe British ideal. What was his\ndefence? Again, he stressed\nthe importance of the fact\nthat he \u201cengaged regularly\u201d\nwith those with whom he might\ndisagree. Interesting indeed.\nPutting these individuals\naside, I am equally\ndisappointed by the\nhypocritical attitude of the\n1.3 million UK signatories.\nEngagement with other views\nand opinions is what your\nhatred of Trump is based on\n\u2013 following suit makes you,\nby your own estimations, as\nbad as him. As well as this,\nUK foreign policy is built on\ncross communication. We\nhave open communication\nwith Saudi Arabia, where\nwomen are banned from\ndriving, Iran, Zimbabwe and\nRussia, amongst others. It\nis not a complex lesson to\nlearn: ignoring problems and\npeople does not make them\ngo away, and discussion\nand engagement are the\ncornerstones of cooperation\nand inclusivity. The United\nNations is emblematic of this,\nstanding as a centre point for\nall nations to pool opinions,\nresources, and backgrounds,\nin a combined effort to make\nthe world a better place.\nIrrespective of your views\non Donald Trump and his\nimmigration policy, in any\nsituation, principles are what\nyou act by. If you truly believe\nin bringing together people of\ndifferent faiths, backgrounds,\nethnicities and \u2013 most\nfundamentally \u2013 opinions,\nthen there are no grounds\nfor a call for disengagement.\nWake up.\nComing out\nwas an attempt\nto find myself\nLucille Calmon discusses labels, coming\nout and falling in love\nI\nwasaspecialkid(thelonely\nand isolated type, always\nlost in their thoughts).\nAround the age of five,\nI remember first hearing\nabout homosexuality\nand even though it was not\nquite described as a \u2018bad\nthing\u2019, I still associated it with\nsomething to be afraid of.\nI told myself \u201cwith my luck,\nit will happen to me too\u201d\nwhile thinking about a family\nmember who was actually gay.\nGrowing up, I became\nobsessed with boys. Though\nI kept falling for random\nguys, I seemed unable to get\na boyfriend. And there was\nalways that little thought that\nkept popping up, convincing\nme that eventually something\nwouldhappenandmydormant\nsexuality would wake up.\nWhen bored, I\u2019d do these\nthought experiments \u2018for\n\\\\ The truth is that there is no\naccurate label to describe\nme, or anyone \\\\\nfun\u2019. I wondered how it\nmight feel to be with a\ngirl. When crushes started\nreturning my attention, I\u2019d\nrealise, as terrifying as it\nfelt (I was 15), that I was\nno longer interested in\nthem. Not one bit. Still, just\nto make sure, I kissed my\nfirst boyfriend. I freaked\nout realising something\nwas wrong, unable to put\nmy finger on it. I declared\nmyself \u2018confused\u2019, lacking a\nmore accurate \u2013 or perhaps\nself-aware \u2013 label. I kept\nfalling in love, careful to\nchoose men as unavailable\nas possible to avoid tragic\ndisillusions.\nWhat followed were two\nyears of total confusion\nand constant flip-flopping.\nI would spend a few weeks\nconvinced I was gay,\nembrace my identity, feel\ninternally proud, and lose\nany and all interest in\nguys (in secret of course).\nThen one morning, I would\nwake up feeling straight,\nconvinced I \u201chadn\u2019t met the\nright guy yet\u201d. This would\nlast for a few weeks and I\nwould eventually go back\nto being a \u2018full-on lesbian\u2019.\nIn a state of total confusion,\nand too early (in hindsight)\nI started coming out, craving\na label.\nThe main reason for this, I\nnow think, must have been\nthe lack of community: not\nknowing any gay girls in\nhigh school and being too\nyoung to gather the courage\nto go out and meet any.\nI originally came out as\nbisexual, diplomatically,\nthinking it would be a solution\nto my feelings of confusion.\nSadly, my coming out was\nnot accepted by my friends\nand peers, who, invoking my\nfeminine looks, rejected it.\nAt the age of 18, I was peer\npressured into seeing a guy.\nWe dated for a few months\nbut it just wasn\u2019t working. It\nwas just wrong. It felt like\nI had to prove a point by\ndating him but at the same\ntime I was convinced that\nbeing with a girl was what\nI really wanted. After this\nsecond round of disillusionment (and even though I\nreally liked him as a person),\nI came out again. Those first\nfew years left a bitter after-taste. I was gay. But I had\nonly dated guys, had no\nlesbian friends or lesbian\nexperience. I was a \u2018straight\nlesbian\u2019. My appearance\nand my past somehow made\nmy coming out illegitimate.\nLeaving home for San\nFrancisco was the turning\npoint. Free at last from social\npressures, I met the cutest\nhuman I had ever met. In a\nmoment of courage, I asked\nif they were gay. And they\nwere. We fell in love and I\nbrought them home to Paris\nwhere we moved in together.\nThey introduced me to their\nSan Francisco queer circle\n(a community that seemed\ndeliberately hidden from me\nbefore). I came out naturally\nwithout formal announce-ments. I was happy.\nWhen I moved to London, I\nrealised that my identity was\nrespected. I naturally talked\nabout my partner without\nhiding their gender.\nThe thing about coming\nout (though I\u2019m aware it\ndepends greatly on social\nbackground/ family situa-tion) is that it was only a \u2018big\nthing\u2019 when I was making it\none. The first awkward com-ing-outs to my then-peers\nwere in fact coming-outs to\nmyself. I was publicly shouting \u201cI am queer\u201d in an effort\nto make the claim real.\nStruggling to define myself\nusing a pre-made identity, I\ngot to think a lot about labels.\nThe truth is that they\u2019re great\nsafety nets. Society decides\nwhat is expected of a person\nbased on their identity and\nfollowing this social to-do\nplan makes life so much\neasier. But retrospectively,\ncoming out was really about\nfinding myself, and sticking\nto a label only gave me a\nrough sketch to start with.\nI won\u2019t deny that I still feel\nattracted to people of the\nopposite gender and I do\nwonder what kind of label\nthat attaches to me; weird\nlesbian, bisexual, pansex-ual, or just confused? The\ntruth is that there is no accurate label to describe me, or\nanyone.\nI realised that my final\ncoming out was never about\nsticking a visible \u2018Lesbian\u2019\nsticker on my forehead but\na \u2018Lucille\u2019 one. It was about\nembracing who I am as a\nperson, and now that I\u2019m at\npeace with myself, I don\u2019t\nneed to come out again.\n\\\\ I would spend a\nfew weeks convinced\nI was gay, and lose\nany and all interest\nin guys. Then one\nmorning, I would\nwake up feeling\nstraight, convinced I\n\"hadn't met the right\nguy yet\" \\\\\n\\\\ I was gay. But\nI had only dated\nguys, had no lesbian\nfriends or lesbian\nexperience. I was a\n'straight lesbian' \\\\\n\n"

As\nmemory serves, we\nlost that game in a narrow\novertime loss. The team have\ncome far since then, and\nwe showed it this Sunday.\nThe Falcons (no Super Bowl\nrelation) were quickly given\nthe ball after an unsuccessful\nImperial Immortals\u2019 drive lead\nto a score for the Falcons.\nThere were evidently some\nnerves over the new offensive\nplaybook. The hollow bones\nof the Falcons were then\nshaken by monstrous runs by\nJason \u2018Book your hospital\nbed\u2019 Patrick Kuilan who won\nONLY Offensive MVP, even\nwith the absolutely savage\nhits on defence where he\nalso plays line-backer. He\nscored the first touchdown\nwith a bone-shattering run\nthat unfortunately left an\ninjured Falcon in his wake, the\nImperial Immortals wish the\nFalcon a speedy recovery.\nA two-point conversion was\nscored with a leaping catch\nby Aaron \u2018don\u2019t knock it \u2018til\nyou try it\u2019 Wilson. Aaron\nwent on to make quite a few\ncatches both on offence,\ndefence and Metric (one\ncatch was the touchdown\nthat won us the game), so his\nplays made him deserving of\nthe honour of overall MVP.\nThis was a joint award given\nto Lukas \u201840 yard crawl\u2019\nHanns for his plays on both\noffence and defence that\nincluded an excellently-executed reverse play that\nhad him strolling toward the\nend zone. Unfortunately he\nwas hit out of bounds within\nten yards but a short pass\ngave Aaron the touchdown.\nDefence was as stellar as\nalways with Teddy Tal-e-onping-pong (Defensive MVP)\nleading them to an almost\nperfect game. A new face on\ndefence was Dan \u2018not in my\nswamp\u2019 Grumberg (Line MVP)\nwho ate up the Falcons\u2019 runs\nall day. Special teams can\nbe personified by one play\nof Markus \u2018My pres\u2019 Mohr\n(Special team MVP), when he\nbulldozed the unsuspecting\nkick returner leaving the\nFalcon spread-eagled (pun\nfully-intended) on the floor\nlooking up to Markus who\nwas standing above him with\na pose that clearly stated:\n\u201cDon\u2019t step to me, fam\u201d.\nIt ain\u2019t pretty, this home of\nours.

The record\nremained standing as IC 1s\ndominated the set-piece to\nwin a comfortable away\nvictory against Surrey. Man\nof the Match Tom \u2018Shuz\u2019\nSzyszko put in an admirable\nshift as the forward pack\nwon themselves a penalty\ntry after numerous scrums on\nthe opposition five metre line.\nStrong defence around the\nruck kept Surrey\u2019s attack to\na minimum, although some\nslow folding caught IC off\nguard out wide a few times.\nHowever, excellent scramble\ndefence kept Surrey just short\nof the line and IC were soon\nback on the front foot, and a\nlate first half penalty helped\nImperial lead 10-0 at the\nbreak. A strong start to the\nsecond half put IC back in\nSurrey\u2019s 22, and Shuz soon\nsurprised all with a burst\nof speed and dexterity to\nbatter down the defence and\nscore a textbook reaching-try. Charles Price-Smith,\nspurred on by a female friend\nsupporting on the touchline,\nslotted the conversion from\nout wide. Another try was\nscored out wide to bring the\nscore to 22-0. IC pushed for\nthe bonus point, but Charles\nwanted to catch up with his\nfriend on the sideline and\npromptly got himself a yellow\ncard. With Imperial\u2019s defence\nstretched and some rushed\nexits, Surrey came back to\nscore two tries before the\nimpending whistle. Final score\n22-12. Congrats to Shuz for a\nstand-out return, and to DNS\nfor a quality defensive game.\nImmortals are UNDEFEATED\nat #FortHarlington, and we\nwill look to stay that way\ngoing into our game next\nweek, against top-of-the-league Cambridge Pythons,\nwho we lost narrowly against\nlast week.

It was\nvery early in the morning and\nthe sea of people that occupied 568 were full off chicken\nwings, burgers and curly fries,\nas well as American bever-ages, all organised by the\nImperial Immortals (Imperial\u2019s\nconfident lead and nine am\ncommitments I headed to\nbed\u2026 What a plonker.\nHaving now watched\nthe second half (although\nnot at the Union and as\npost-mortem). I can somewhat\ncomment on what took place.\nIt was Tom Brady living up\nto his title of GOAT, and\nthe defence straight balling\non an overly complacent\nFalcons\u2019 offence. At the start\nthe Patriots offence seemed\nto struggle, making the same\nmistakes and failed drives\nas the first half. The initial\nchange happened on the\ndefence, when they stopped\nthe Falcons\u2019 drives consist-ently. This was a theme for the\nrest of the game. Personally,\nI would say the turning point\nof the game was early in the\nfourth quarter when linebacker Dont\u2019a Hightower\nflies off the edge, evading\nDevonta Freeman\u2019s feeble\nattempt at a block, then to\nsmack Matt Ryan off his feet\nand force the fumble. The\nfumble was recovered by the\nPatriots giving them great\nfield position and momentum.\nIt\u2019s fair to say Matty ice was\nnot so cool after that.\nThe other play of note is\nJulian Edelman\u2019s miracle\n\u2018shoe\u2019 catch\u2026 After the ball\nwas tipped by a Falcons\u2019\nplayer, there was a free-for-all which left Edelman\nsandwiched between three\nFalcons\u2019 players. Juggling\nthe ball, Edelman with the\nconcentration of a monk,\nmanaged to keep the ball\nfrom hitting the ground even\nwhen a rogue foot tried to\ndislodge it from his grip. A\nfew times he seemed to let\ngo of the ball and it was held\nthere by what seemed to be\ndivine intervention waiting\nto be plucked from the ether\n(on second thought it was just\nslow motion\u2026). Edelman was\nseventh round draft pick in the\n2009 NFL draft. In college\nhe played quarterback NOT\nthe wide-receiver and punt\nspecialist he came to play as\nin the NFL. Tom Brady was\neven sixth round pick, and the\nJames White (their running\nback who now holds the\nrecord of most points scored\nin a Super bowl) was an\nunknown of the 4th\nround pick.\nThe Patriots seem to build\ntheir franchise on overlooked\nplayers. To take the fire within\nthem from being downtrod-den, and channelling it to\nbe great. This can\u2019t be all\nattributed to a chance or\nsome implicit attribute of the\nfranchise. One source is the\nrecord breaking head coach\nthat has led the Patriots to\nwin five Super bowls during\nhis time. Bill Belichick, like\nVince Lombardi, cares only\nabout winning which can be\nsummarised by his comment\nafter winning one of the (in\nmy opinion) most memorable\nSuper Bowls: \u201cAs of today,\nand as great as today feels\nand as great as today is, in\nall honesty we\u2019re five weeks\nbehind in the 2017 season.\u201d\nThis inexhaustible work ethic\nis what gives the Patriots a\nwinning season year after\nyear.\nI pains me to say it but Tom\nBrady is the GOAT\u2026 The\nrecords he set during this\nSuper Bowl are as follows:\nMost Super Bowls played\nin \u2013 7\nMost passes over his career in\nSuper Bowls \u2013 309\nMost passes in a Super Bowl\n\u2013 62\nMost completions over his\ncareer in Super Bowls \u2013 207\nMost completions in a Super\nBowl \u2013 43\nMost passing yards over his\ncareer in Super Bowls \u2013 2071\nMost passing Yards in game\n\u2013 466\nMost touchdown passes in a\nSuper Bowl \u2013 15\nHe is truly the greatest of all\ntime; to keep his composure,\nand to overcome the largest\npoint deficit (25 points) ever\nrecorded in a Super Bowl. No\nwonder he was named Super\nBowl MVP. The final score was\n34-28 Patriots, a defensive\nshutout for the second half\nby the Patriots, and overtime\ntouchdown sealed the game.\nPerhaps the best match that\nwill be played in my lifetime,\nand I missed it! Moral of the\nstory: don\u2019t be a wettie, go to\nthe Union and watch one of\ngreatest sporting spectacles\nin the world. Celebrate or\ndrown your sorrows, sleep is\nfor the weak.\nImraj Singh\n\\\\ Keith Allison\n\\\\ After the great\njoviality, the team\nI was supporting\nin a confident\nlead and nine am\ncommitments I\nheaded to bed ...\nWhat a plonker \\\\\nown American Football club).\nAlong with the American\nbeverages the bravest of the\nbrave tried Immortals team\nbeverage \u2018Slime\u2019.

At\nthat time there were only 26\nteams, the rest were added as\npart of expansion programs\n(there have been talks of an\nUK based expansion team\nwith 2022 set as the target\ndate). The first Super bowl\nwas played in Los Angeles\nMemorial Coliseum with the\ncr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the NFL\nand AFL being the Green\nBay Packers and Kansas City\nChiefs respectively. Under the\ncoaching of the legendary\nVince Lombardi the Green\nBay Packers won the game.\nQuarterback Bart Starr was\nnamed Super bowl MVP for\nhis dominant 250 yard, two\ntouchdown performance;\nimpressive in those times. The\nfollowing year the Packers\nwon again against the\nOakland Raiders with the\nRaiders\u2019 line-backers\u2019 coach\nbeing John Madden, who\nhas his name attributed to the\nlong-running Madden NFL\nvideo game series. The more\nyou know\u2026\nThe Super bowl trophy is\nfamously named the Vince\nLombardi trophy, but why?\nFrom what I have told you\nalready Vince Lombardi has\nonly won two Super Bowls,\nBill Belichick the New England Patriots head coach has\nalready won four (*spoilers*\nnow five). Well you see, it\nisn\u2019t all about numbers. He is\nthe benchmark of what it is\nto be a great coach, leader\nand man. Fifty years on and\nthe coaches of today still look\nup to him. His dedication and\npassion to win is unparalleled\nand can be summarised in\nthis quote: \u201cWinning isn\u2019t\neverything; it\u2019s the only\nthing\u201d, he never coached\na losing season and had a\n90% win rate in post-season.\nUnfortunately, in 1970, at the\nage of 57, he passed away\ndue to cancer of his colon.\nWith his sudden passing the\nnewly merged NFL decided to\nname the Super bowl trophy\nafter the man that had given\nso much to the sport. On his\ndeathbed he reportedly said\nthat he regretted having not\nachieved more in his life. With\nexpectations of himself like\nthat, it is easy to understand\nhow he achieved so much.\nA relentless, unwavering\ndedication to the sport of\nAmerican football. An ideal\nthat all players, and coaches\nmust strive to achieve. The\nallowed him to make some\nepic plays that included some\n\u2018toe drag swag\u2019 that kept him\ninbounds and allowed him to\ncatch the seemingly uncatch-able. As well as the catches,\nthe threat of him alone\nmeant the Patriots defence\nassigned more attention to\nhim. This allowed Taylor\nGabriel, Austin Hooper, and\nMohamed Sanu, to make\nsome plays. Although a lot\ncan be said about the aerial\nassault, what I felt gave the\noffence momentum was the\ndevastating ground and\npound run game. Predominantly it was Devonta\nFreeman and Tevin Coleman\nin the backfield, these two\nrunning backs are still at the\nstart of their careers with less\nthan five years in the league\nbetween them. The Falcons\u2019\noffensive line punched holes\nthrough the Patriots\u2019 defensive\nallowing the two running\nbacks to explode through\ninto the Patriots second level.\nJump-cutting, handing off and\ntrucking their way toward the\nend zone, the duo instilled\nfear in the Patriots defence.\nIt cannot be said that the\nPatriots offence looked drab\nand uncoordinated, with a\nplayer like Tom Brady at the\nhelm it would never be so.\nIt was the Falcon\u2019s Defence\nthat played out their skin. This\nis evidenced by an 82 yard\npick six from Robert Alford,\nBrady isn\u2019t one to make\nstupid mistakes and looking\nat the tape again you can\nappreciate how great (albeit\nOnce in his hands it was open\nfield except from a dramatic\nattempt at a tackle from\nBrady. When the half finally\ncame to a close the score was\n21-3 Falcons with the only\nscore from the Patriots being\na 41-yard field goal.\nWhen it got to half-time the\nmood in the Union ranged\nfrom deep melancholy to\nexuberant elation. Falcons\u2019\nfans were over the moon with\nthe dominant first half they\nhad. On the other hand, the\nPatriots\u2019 fans were left with an\n(almost) insurmountable score\ndeficient and the repugnant\nsmell of defeat in their nos-trils. Faith seemed to be all\nbut lost, both in the game and\ntheir famed GOAT (greatest\nof all time) quarterback Tom\nBrady.\nTo the non-dedicated and\nuninterested fans the best part\nof the night was just starting\nat the Union: The halftime\nshow. Cue the lights, the\nmusic, and Lady Gaga in the\nmost comical of American\nfootball equipment flying\naround NRG Stadium (in a\npinnacle of excellence, the\nVince Lombardi Trophy. On\nFebruary 5th\nof this year,\nthe fifty first super bowl was\nplayed (LI for those Romans\nout there), and as you probably heard, it was contested by\nthe Atlanta Falcons and New\nEngland Patriots.\nThe first half was a very\ndominant performance by the\nFalcons with Matt Ryan as\nquarterback (a position sometimes referred more fittingly\nas Field General), delivering\na devastating aerial assault\non the Patriots defence. With\nshort bullet passes and long\nbombs to his receivers, his\ncannon of an arm obliterated\nyards. A big advantage was\nhaving Julio \u2018the freak\u2019 Jones\nthat seems to be genetically\nengineered to play ball, he\nis six foot three, 220 pounds,\nwith a sub-4.4 second 40\ndash time. Perhaps you don\u2019t\nknow what that means, but let\nme assure you he is a beast.\nJulio managed to couple his\npower, and strength, with a\ncontrol and elegance that\n\\\\ Winning isn\u2019t\neverything, it\u2019s the\nonly thing \\\\\n\\\\ Flying downhill to\nsnag the ball out of\nthe receiver\u2019s hands;\nhe seemed to know\nexactly where the\nball was going \\\\\nrisky) of a play this was by\nthe Falcons\u2019 player.

Maybe some kissing.\nYes that\u2019s fairly accurate. Most of my sexual encounters have\ntended to revolve around oral or bum sex. There is a fairly wide\nrange of things guys do though, hand jobs can be fun. Masturbating two penises together is another one. Rimming is also\ngreat if you like that kind of thing.\nA gay and a lesbian walk into a bar...\n... and proceed to shatter any and all illusions you might have about gay sex\nThis week, I met with B.R Coli, a female queer friend, to talk about sex. We wanted to shed some light on the general ins and outs and common\nmisconceptions surrounding gay sex, as well as learn a bit about each other\u2019s sex lives and see what common ground we have, and what\u2019s different\nbetween man sex and\u2026 well, woman sex. In adherence to heteronormative gender stereotypes B.R. Coli\u2019s in pink and I\u2019m in blue.\nB.C. Maile\n\\\\ Well\noral and manual\nstuff definitely hap-pens, but more often\nthan not toys are involved \\\\\nMan-on-man sex\nMy idea of lesbian sex is that it\u2019s probably fairly orally focussed with a\nfair bit of handy play?\nWell oral and manual stuff definitely happens, but more often than not toys\nare involved. Vibrators, dildos and strap-ons are common. It can be difficult\nfor a lot of girls to orgasm without using a toy of some kind. Do guys use\ntoys much?\nOK, I think toys are a fairly common thing for gay guys, although I\u2019d say\nmuch less so. They are considered by many to be a bit of a kink.\nWoman-on-woman sex*\n*We are not sexist and will not refer to it as girl-ongirl sex\nFor guys, there\u2019s usually a top (the guy who puts his penis into the\nother one) and a bottom (the guy who gets a penis put in him).\nThere also tends to be a more dominant and a more submissive\npartner. The top isn\u2019t always the dominant one though, sometimes you get what\u2019s called a \u2018power bottom\u2019 who takes the\nlead in the encounter. For girls, is there a standard behavioural\ndynamic where partners take distinct roles?\nYes, there tends to be a partner who takes a more dominant role\nin lesbian sex too. Usually this partner will be using a toy or fingers\non a more passive or submissive one. There are some situations where\nthe roles are shared more evenly but I\u2019d say for most, it\u2019s an asymmetrical\ndynamic. Age gaps are also a bit of a thing. Many women only feel able\nto come out much later in life, and relationships between those women and\nyoung lesbians are common.\nTops and bottoms\nActually a lot of the time you\u2019ll fool around for ages without the orgasm\nbeing a distinct aim, but it can still be a satisfying and pleasurable\nsexual encounter without either partner coming. I\u2019ve always been\ncurious though about bottoms. Do they cum?\nWell generally guy sex ends in both partners coming. although\nsometimes it\u2019s just one or neither #helpful. The bottom generally does cum. During butt sex he gets a fair bit of pleasurable\nstimulation to his prostate. Usually this won\u2019t cause a hands free\norgasm but it makes it fairly quick when combined with masturba-tion. Sometimes nobody cums but both partners have a great time.\nIt depends on the nature of the encounter really.\nCumming\nHookups\nThere\u2019s a bit of a bar scene in London. There are some places where people\ncan go to pull. I\u2019m not super into casual hook-ups but the bars are OK. From\nmy experience, they tend to be geared towards more femme girls and are\ngenerally fairly cis-dominated environments. As for apps, the pickings are\nfairly slim for girls. There\u2019s Tinder, which people get some success on. There\u2019s\nalso a dating app called Her which is aimed at queer, lesbian and bisexual\ngirls. People aren\u2019t generally too willing to meet up on that one though.\nI think it can be more difficult for girls meet each other. There is still\na lot of homophobia towards queer or lesbian girls so it can be\nmuch more challenging to be open about your\nsexuality.\nI think that\u2019s true. The male gay scene generally allows for\nfairly easy hook-ups. Pulling in bars is fairly common. For me\nI\u2019ve met all of my partners through apps. Tinder is also used\namong gay guys but in my experience, Grindr has yielded\nmuch more success. For those who don\u2019t know, it\u2019s basically like\nTinder but everyone swipes right. Sometimes the hypersexual\nnature of it can be a bit overwhelming though!\nWell that\u2019s all we have space for! I hope you guys enjoyed and learned\nsomething from our chat. There was a lot of stuff I would have liked to\ninclude, and many misconceptions about the way \u2018the gays\u2019 get down and\ndirty that would be great to talk about BUT Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day.\n\n"

Those of us watching\nBBC\u2019s Hospital last week, were\nreminded of the importance of\nthese values, as we witnessed\noverseas patients facing\nexorbitant bills for life-saving\ntreatment.\nUnfortunately, the NHS is not\nmeetingtheneedsofeveryone.\nA recent government report\non transgender equality\naddressed the very real\nchallenges facing trans people\nin accessing health services,\nhighlighting \u201cthe persistent\nrefusal of some GPs to even\nmake referrals to gender\nidentity clinics\u201d. A recent\nsurvey of Imperial students\nand bisexual men are used to\nhearing from the Daily Mail\n(denouncing HIV prevention\ndrug PrEP), but not something\nwe expect from our doctors.\nLGB patients face similar\nprejudices, with Stonewall\u2019s\nUnhealthy Attitudes report\nrevealing that a shocking\n24% of NHS staff have heard\ncolleagues making negative\nremarks about LGB people.\nA similarly appalling 10% of\nstaff have heard colleagues\nexpressing the belief that\nLGB people can be \u2018cured\u2019\nusing conversion therapy,\na sadistic practice that has\nbeen condemned by most\nmajor medical organisations.\nDoctors have been quoted\nstatingthat\u201cbeingtransgender\nis mostly a mental condition\u201d\nand \u201ddeviations are not to be\nconsidered by mainstream\nsociety\u201d, attitudes that don\u2019t\nbelong in this century, never\nmind our public services.\nThe belief held by many\nthat LGBT people are now\non equal footing with their\nstraight counterparts does\nnot match the experience of\nthe community, particularly\nregardingaccesstohealthcare.\nThis is largely driven by a lack\nof understanding, rather than\nwilful discrimination, with\n10% of staff not feeling able\nto meet the needs of LGB\npatients \u2013 rising to 24% for\ntrans patients. LGBT patients\nface higher rates of sexually-transmitted diseases, mental\nhealth problems and addiction\nwhilst facing prejudice\nand ignorance from health\nprofessionals that discourage\nthem from seeking help.\nDr. John Dean, chair of the\ncommittee advising the NHS\non gender identity services,\nexplained that \u201cPeople\nworking in the service try to be\nempathic; they are certainly\nsympathetic, but they lack\na great deal of background\nknowledge about gender\nincongruence and dysphoria.\u201d\nThis is symptomatic of a\nmedical education system\nthat is failing to prepare\nfuture doctors to support trans\npeople, as well as the wider\nhealth inequalities exist, there\nis no teaching on the specific\nchallenges faced by LGBT\npeople. Some lecturers have\nmade an effort to be inclusive\nin their teaching, but most fail\nto maintain a basic distinction\nthe medical curriculum.\nWe\u2019re aiming to include\ncompulsory teaching on\ngender dysphoria, health\ninequalities, and non-binary\ngender identities/sexualities,\nas well as more diverse sexual\nhealth teaching. Medical\nstudents are taught to always\ncommunicate sensitively and\nput the patient first, so we are\nalso campaigning to improve\nclinical communication\nteaching; small things like\nasking about pronouns and the\nsex of sexual partners make a\nbig difference to patients. A\nlaborious review of the current\ncurriculum has yielded a\ncomprehensive plan of where\nteaching can be improved,\nwhich was recently presented\nto Mr. Lupton and Dr. Harris,\nthe Head and Deputy Head of\nUndergraduate Medicine.\nThankfully, the faculty have\nbeen very receptive to making\nthese improvements, and\nthey are being incorporated\ninto the ongoing curriculum\nreview process. It remains\nto be seen whether this will\nresult in meaningful change to\nteaching, but we are hopeful\nthat this will be implemented\n\u2013 and make a real difference\nto the future LGBT patients of\nImperial doctors.\n\\\\ There\u2019s the\npersistent refusal of\nsome GPs to even\nmake referrals to\ngender identity\nclinics \\\\\n\\\\ One of the most\ncited problems by\nImperial medical\nstudents was that\nall gay men in\nour practice exam\nquestions have\nHIV \\\\\nconducted by IQ (Imperial\u2019s\nLGBT+ Society), echoed this,\nwith our trans peers having\nexperienced discrimination\nfrom GPs and GUM doctors\n(sexual health specialists).\nUnderstandably this leads\nto distrust in a profession\nthat ought to be the most\ntrustworthy. One trans patient\nwas even told they would\nbe \u201ctaking money away\nfrom more deserving cancer\npatients\u201d, an argument gay\n\\\\ A shocking 24%\nof NHS staff have\nheard colleagues\nmaking negative\nremarks about LGB\npeople \\\\\nqueer community.\nImperial is no different in\nthis arena. One might expect\nan internationally renowned\ninstitutiontobeleadingtheway\nin improving quality of care\nfor all patients, but the current\ncurriculum is frustratingly\nlight on LGBT issues. Apart\nfrom a vague reference to\nnot discriminating against\npatients on the basis of sexual\norientation or gender, and an\nacknowledgement that LGBT\nbetween gender and sex. One\nof the most cited problems by\nImperial medical students\nwas that all gay men in our\npractice exam questions have\nHIV; it seems perpetuating\nthis stereotype is the closest\nwe can get to teaching about\nLGBT inequality.\nThis has prompted a\ncampaign by a passionate\ngroup of students, medical\nand non-medical, queer and\nstraight allies, to improve\n\\\\ Some lecturers\nhave made an effort\nto be inclusive in\ntheir teaching, but\nmost fail to maintain\na basic distinction\nbetween gender\nand sex \\\\\nCharing Cross Gender Identity Clinic \\\\ Ted Eytan\nthe abundance of tills,\ninsightfully pointing out that\n\u201cunluckily one person can\u2019t\noperate two tills.\u201d\nAnurag Deshpande, a final\nyear physicist says, \u201cNo one\nknows how to use the tills\nand it\u2019s taking forever to get\nserved.\u201d\nBlythe has rebuffed criticism\nby arguing that there\u2019s been\n\u201ca few training sessions for our\nstaff in advance but it can take\ntime to get used to different\nsystems.\u201d\nThe felix team, in an attempt\nto separate fact from fiction,\nventured out from the safety\nof the West Basement and\nordered a coke AND a pizza\nwhile timing the whole ordeal.\nWe entered FiveSixEight at\n1:43pm on a Thursday. The\nbar was moderately busy.\nThere were two servers: one\nbehind the bar, one serving\nfood. Putting an order in took\nthree minutes and 24 seconds.\nGetting served our coke took\nUnion bars get new tills\nStudent body remains unimpressed\nLef Apostolakis\nunder the impression that\nthere never was a limit on\nYoyo payments anyway).\nTheresa Davey, who has\nspent nearly a decade at\nImperial says \u201cI\u2019ve never\nhad a problem with the limit\non card payments because\nI know to give them a stern\nlook and bat my eyelashes\u201d.\nIf you\u2019re not Davey, though,\nyou\u2019ll be happy to know that\nthe chip and pin payment limit\nhas been reduced to three\npounds (though if only it had\nbeen reduced a further 40p\nyou would have been able\nto get a snakebi\u2013 you know\nwhat, no. Just get contactless\nyou lazy fu\u2013)\nHey, you can even order\na shot of lime cordial, pay\n20p for it on contactless and\nproceed to do said shot of\ncordial. If that isn\u2019t progress,\nwe don\u2019t know what is.\nS\no you might\nhave heard \u2013 or\nyou might have\ngathered from\nseeing the long\nlines of students\nstretching from Beit all the way\ndown Exhibition Road \u2013 that\nthe Union has updated its tills.\nThe brand new tills and the\n\u201cfancy new yoyo scanners\u201d\nwhich were installed on\nMonday, are promised to\nincrease speed of service.\nThough so far they have only\nincreased frustration amongst\nstudents eagerly awaiting to\nbe served, but being met with\nempty tills instead.\nAs per tradition, Imperial\nstudents have been incessantly\nmoaning about the \u201cdismal\nservice\u201d at every opportunity.\nOn Facebook, one Computing\nundergraduate accused\nRachel Blythe, DPFS, of\n\u201cconfusing her staff with these,\nthey\u2019ve been struggling all\nweek\u201d. Another one lamented\nan additional one minute and\n30 seconds. Getting our pizza\nto take away took a final\neleven minutes.\nOur research shockingly\nproved inconclusive.\nWe also tried squeezing the\ntruth out of the staff on duty.\nWhen asked how she felt\nabout the new tills one staff\nmember laughed awkwardly\nand stared intently into the\npint of coke she was serving\nus. Another staff member said\nshe hadn\u2019t had the chance to\nuse the tills yet but that they\nseemed fine. Coincidentally\nthe Head of Student Voice\nswooped behind her to pick\nup his lunch, but ran off before\nwe could get the chance to ask\nany questions. He\u2019s getting\nfaster. Regardless of whether\nthey\u2019re any good, they were\nprobably expensive. Our\ninvestigative team estimates\na cost around the \u00a330,000\nmark, but the DPFS has yet to\nconfirm the exact cost of the\nproject.\nBut enough about the tills.\nThere have been even more\nradical changes that we\nhaven\u2019t even touched upon\nyet.\nThe \u00a35 minimum spend has\nbeen dropped from Apple\nPay, contactless and Yoyo\npayments, (though we were\nof it\u2019s anti-immigration and\nparticularly anti-Somali\nrhetoric but also due to his\npseudo-scientific arguments.\nfelix found the research\n\u2018cited\u2019 to be either unrelated\nto the argument presented or\nunreliable, having undergone\na dubious-at-best \u2018peerreview\u2019 process.\nThe tweets eventually\nresulted in a condemning\nstatement from King\u2019s\nIntersectional Feminist\nSociety and a subsequent\npetition from King\u2019s Somali\nSociety demanding a \u201cformal\napology\u201d.\n\u201cSomali students have\nexpressed hurt and anger that\nsuch educator and peer could\nexpress so much stigmatised\nand ad hoc rhetoric directed\ntowards them, fellow Muslims\nand black communities based\non nothing but unevaluated\nstatistics.

Let\u2019s\nmake them fall in love with their best never-explicitly-bisexual friend, or go for the 'got drunk, had sex, \"oh my god\nI\u2019m gay\"' approach. Ok we\u2019ve run out of lesbian storyline. What do we do? Ask a queer to write a relatable story\nabout the hardships of queer love? Nah. We\u2019ll kill one.\u201d\nAnyway. One Day at a Time is great. It\u2019s very heartwarming and covers really great themes in a thoughtful\nand realistic way, avoiding the familiar tropes faced by lesbians on screen. Again, Hispanic representation is top\nquality.\nOne Day at a Time is available on Netflix\nLike the love-child of a telenovela and\nPushing Dasies, this Netflix comedy\ncentres around Jane, a Latina woman\nwho is accidentally artificially insemi-nated, and then has to decide between\nthe father of her child or her boyfriend.\nWill she choose Raphael or the other\none? I don\u2019t care! I\u2019m watching this show\nfor the Latina lesbian gynaecologist\nwho accidently dates her drug-lord step\nmum. Highly representative of the messy\ncomplicated relationships us queer girls\nalways seem to find ourselves in.\nJane the Virgin is available on Netflix\nArts Queer Cabaret\nSO QUEER. I\u2019ve had a range of\nexperiences here, all of which have been\npretty great. There are about six acts per\nnight, and each is super different. You\u2019ll\nget drag queens, drag kings, non-binary\nmonarchs(?), stand-up, and musicians all\nin one night, and all fairly-to-extremely\ngender-bending. Don\u2019t go expecting\nRuPaul-esque drag: some will take their\nclothes off and reveal a lot of glitter \u2013\nit\u2019s messy, political, unpolished, arty\nqueerness.\nQueer Cabaret is on every Tuesday at\nthe Royal Vauxhall Tavern\nGRRRL ZINE FAIR\nNot explicitly queer \u2013 but inherently so \u2013 this event has\na great community feel to it, and it\u2019s an eary way to make\nfriends. Support zines! Meet cool feminists! Read and buy\ncool zines. Make your own zines and prints! Watch weird\nbands!\nI discovered a band called Garden Centre at GRRRL ZINE,\nwhose lyrics run along the lines of \u201csomething cut me in the\nrubbish / what if it\u2019s teeth / what if I found you in the rubbish\nand therefore you found me\u201d.

The philandering Duke\nand his posse of henchmen\nare easily transposed from\nnobility to gang life; the\ntitular court jester, Rigoletto,\nbecomes a bartender at the\nbar they frequent. His daughter Gilda remains the innocent\ngirl unaware of the menacing\nworld around her, and her\nill-usage at the hands of the\nDuke and his men point to the\nsubordinate role of women in\na very much male-dominated\nworld. The Duke\u2019s henchmen\nexclaim over Gilda\u2019s pure and\ninnocent beauty, but have\nno qualms kidnapping her\nfor revenge on Rigoletto; the\nDuke himself professes concern for his \u201cbeloved angel\u201d,\nbut does not hesitate to rape\nand abandon her afterward.\nSparafucile, the contract\nkiller hired by Rigoletto in his\nvendetta against the Duke, is\nperhaps even more at home\nwith a fedora and a switchblade than he was in Verdi\u2019s\n16th\ncentury Mantua.\nThe first performance of this\nproduction was in 1982, but\nthe set seems as fresh as ever.\nA stylish bar \u2013 all oak panelling and mirrors \u2013 serves as\nthe Duke\u2019s headquarters. The\nhordes of suit-clad henchmen\nin sunglasses lend a distinct\nMen in Black air to the\nscenes. As Rigoletto leaves\nthe bar for his home, the\nshadowy figure of Sparafucile emerges from a dark\nand foggy alleyway to make\nhis proposition. The set of\nthe last act provides a great\ncontrast between the well-lit\ntawdry bar in which the Duke\nflirts with Sparafucile\u2019s sister\nMaddalena, and the thunder\nand lightning outside as Gilda\nlooks on, steeling herself for a\nfatal sacrifice.\nIf only the cast lived up to\nthese promising surroundings.\nThe three main roles are\nsung by American singers\nimported from across the\npond, but none of them are\nparticularly outstanding.\nPlaying the Duke, Joshua\nGuerrero\u2019s voice was too\nphlegmatic to make either a\nconvincing mafia boss or a\ncompelling Casanova. Worse\nstill was Nicholas Pallesen,\nwhose Rigoletto fell terribly\nflat. It felt like he was merely\ndeclaiming his lines with no\nemotion behind them; instead\nof moving the audience to\nhorror and pity, Pallesen\nsucceeded only in arousing\nfaint boredom. Apparently he\nwas suffering from a cold on\nopening night, but whether\nhe can bring out the role\u2019s\nfull potential remains to be\nseen. Sydney Mancasola was\nperhaps the saving grace,\nwith her clear but somewhat\ntimid voice quite suited to the\nrole of Gilda. Perhaps ENO\nshould just stick to British singers \u2013 Barnaby Rea deserves\na special mention for his\nbrooding Sparafucile, as\ndoes Madeleine Shaw for her\nprovocative Maddalena.\nThis run of Rigoletto has\nalmost everything going for\nit: great direction, great set,\nthe 13th\nrevival of a well-loved production. But it is\nundoubtedly hampered by\nits uninspiring cast. Jonathan\nMiller\u2019s Rigoletto has the\npotential to be a crowd-draw-ing classic \u2013 if only ENO finds\nthe right people for the job.\nRigoletto is on at the ENO\nuntil the 28th\nof February.\nTickets from \u00a312.\nM\narginalia\nare the\nannotations\none finds\nscribbled\nin the\nmargins of a text; they\ncan be insightful, witty or\nrude depending on the\ncommentator in question.\nReading Drawings is a new\ncollection at the Courtauld\nGallery that aims to showcase\nthe equivalent in drawings\n\u2013 inscriptions on sketches\ndating from the 16th\nto the 20th\ncentury.\nUnlike the marginalia in\nbooks, where readers jot\ndown their thoughts on the\ntext, writings on drawings\nare more often done by the\nartists themselves, and on\nrough sketches rather than\nthe final masterpiece. As\nsignatures are possibly the\nmost natural mark to make on\nan artwork, a variety are on\ndisplay in Reading Drawings.\nParticularly interesting are\ninstances of drawings signed\nby someone else. One such\nexample is a sketch of a\nfemale nude purportedly by\nAuguste Rodin: the \"unchar-acteristically even pressure\"\nin the false signature suggests\ninstead the work of the forger,\nHand B. In contrast, the handwriting of a reliable collector\nhelps to identify the creator of\na sketch from the 18th\ncentury.\nUnrelated notes on sketches\nalso provide amusing insights\nabout the artists who wrote\nthem. An ancient grocery list\nfrom the 15th\ncentury makes\nan appearance, as do a\npainter\u2019s musings about the\namount of money he is soon\nto be paid.\nDespite its efforts at making\nancient scribbles interesting,\nReading Drawings remains\nslightly too academic for the\ngeneral public. The exhibition\nis small, with only 20-odd\nsketches, but manages to\nsuffer from a lack of organ-isation: the introduction\nto the exhibition is placed\nawkwardly in a far corner\nand there is no indication as\nto any order or arrangement\nin which one should view the\ndisplays. Moreover, despite\nthe title \u2018Reading Drawings\u2019,\nthe inscriptions are not actually transcribed or translated\nfor the viewers to read. Without excellent eyesight and\nknowledge of Latin, Dutch or\nItalian, viewers can only rely\nupon the curator\u2019s interpretation and comments to make\nsense of the writing on the\ndrawings; this leaves one\nfeeling rather unsatisfied.\nHowever, Reading Drawings is only a part of the\nmuch larger attraction that\nis the Courtauld Gallery's\npermanent collection of\nworld-famous paintings. Stop\nat Reading Drawings along\nthe way if time permits, but if\nnot \u2013 it\u2019s no great loss either.\nReading Drawings is on at\nthe Courtauld Gallery until\nthe 4th\nof June. Free entry to\nstudents.\nENO's Rigoletto \\\\ Alastair Muir\nCirce and Ulysses, Stradanus\\\\ Courtauld Gallery\nReading\nDrawings\nClaire Chan\nClaire Chan\nI\nt\u2019s never a good sign\nwhen the set outshines the\nmain cast. Unfortunately\nfor the ENO\u2019s latest\nrendition of Jonathan\nMiller\u2019s superbly\nconceptualised Rigoletto, this\nis very much the case.\nMiller takes us back to\n1950s New York City, in the\nshadier Mafia-dominated\nparts of Little Italy. It is a curiously appropriate retelling\nof the drama of Rigoletto:\nT\noday, when we\nlive in much more\ntolerant and\ninclusive times\nthan those in the\npast, it is really important\nto remember that even a\nterm such as \u2018LGBT\u2019 can\nsometimes forget to include\ncertain groups of people,\nnecessitating the term\n\u2018LGBT+\u2019. One such group\nthat is often completely\nforgotten about in the\ndiscussion of sexuality\nis in fact the situation\nwhen a person does\nnot experience\nsexual attraction.\nAsexuality.\nWhile it is of\ncourse common\nfor a character in a\nshow to not display\nany signs of sexuality,\njust think of most children\u2019s\nshows, what is incredibly\nrare is a character openly\nidentifying as asexual or\naromantic. One could argue\nthat a character like Sheldon\nCooper from The Big Bang\nTheory could be read as\nidentifying as asexual,\nhowever, this portrayal is far\nfrom helpful or sensitive to the\ncommunity. It\u2019s more written\nas a result of his lack of social\nskills or empathy rather than\nan intrinsic part of his identity.\nThe only character in mainstream media that I\u2019m aware\nof to identify as asexual is\nTodd Chavez from Bojack\nHorseman, a Netflix original.\nIn the finale of Season 3,\nafter a whole season\u2019s worth\nof Todd and his high-school\ngirlfriend, Emily skimming\naround the \u2018Will they, won\u2019t\nthey?\u2019 trope, their relationship\nculminates in a conversation\nin a diner, in which Emily asks\nabout his sexuality and he\nreplies \u201cI\u2019m not gay, I mean,\nI don\u2019t think I am, but I don\u2019t\nthink I\u2019m straight, either. I\ndon\u2019t know what I am, I think\nI might be nothing.\u201d, not\nonly would this be a big step\nforward for the asexual community but Emily\u2019s response\nis great too. She simply says\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d She doesn\u2019t\nassume it\u2019s something she\ncan fix, it\u2019s not something that\nrequires follow-up questions.\nIt\u2019s just who he is, and a\n\\\\ Even terms such\nas \u2018LGBT\u2019 can\nsometimes forget\nto include certain\ngroups of people \\\\\nAsexual on Air\nprogram showing how to\nrespond when someone tells\nyou who they are is nearly\nas important as making these\nvisible in the first place.\nHow Todd\u2019s identity goes on\nto shape his character, and\nhis interactions with others\nremains yet to be seen, but I\ntrust that Raphael Bob-Waksberg and the other writers of\nBojack Horseman will treat it\nwith dignity.\n\\\\ Gage Skidmore\nHarry Wilkinson\nT\nango \u2013 the word\nalone conjures\nimages of passion,\nseduction, and\npower play.\nGerman Cornejo\nand his sizzling dance crew\nreturn to London with Tango\nFire to set the stage ablaze.\nThe first part of the show\nharks back to tango\u2019s roots\nin the milongas of Buenos\nAires. Impossibly glamor-ous, the five couples make\ntheir entrance with a slow\ntango foxtrot that gradually builds up to a fast and\nflirtatious dance. Machismo\nand coquetry abound; the\nmen show off their moves to\nimpress the ladies, who turn\nup their noses and trifle with\ntheir fans. It\u2019s nice to see that\nCornejo has also included\nsome diverting male-only\nsequences, which lend a\ntouch of humour to the scene.\nThe show is divided into\ntwo halves, with 13 pieces in\neach hour-long segment. Time\nflies with the mind-boggling\nvariety of sets. With minimal\nstaging and costumes, each\nperformance tells a different\nstory: velvet drapes and\nopera gloves for burlesque,\nfestoon lights and flowers\nfor an evening party. But the\nfocus is rightly on the quality\nof dancing. Between tango\nperformances, the live band,\nQuarteto Fuego (Fire Quartet), and singer Jesus Hidalgo\nentertain the audience with\ntheir soulful tunes.\nOne caveat: Hidalgo\u2019s\nemotive crooning is all very\nwell, but it\u2019s a bit hard to\nappreciate the sadness\nof, for example, Bajo un\nCielo de Estrellas (Beneath\n\u00a1Caliente!\nBurning up\nthe stage with\nTango Fire\nClaire Chan\n\\\\ Sadlers Wells\ncouples to have their time in\nthe limelight.

Ezequiel\nLopez and Camila Alegre\nprove their worth as 2015\nTango World Champions:\nAlegre is light as a bird in\ntheir complicated routines,\nand their footwork is fast as\nlightning. Cornejo and his\npartner Gisela Galeassi are\nexcellent as well, pulling off\ndifficult lifts and spins with\ndexterity and finesse. On the\nother hand, the acrobatics of\nthe couple Sebastian Alvarez\nand Victoria Saudelli are\nsomewhat lacking in grace\ndespite their routine packed\nwith flashy moves.\nCornejo\u2019s flair for choreography is strong in the group\ndances, which are all very\nenjoyable. There are plenty of\nfishnets and lace, as is to be\nexpected, but let it not be said\nthat Cornejo is entirely lacking in subtlety. Oblivion, an\nevocative piece in the second\nhalf, has an interesting contemporary feel to it \u2013 the girls\nin their flowing white dresses\nalmost evoke the ballet dancers of Les Sylphides.\nYou don\u2019t need to be a\ntango aficionado for the raw\nappeal of Tango Fire\u2019s bold\nand flamboyant dancing.

Me too!\nChristy tries to go out of her comfort zone and goes to a new place with a dress-code that serves\nthe fanciest waffles in town, no matter if they are sweet or not, even if they do not reach up her\nhigh expectations.\nChristy Lam\nY\nou should\nnever make a\ncomment about\na restaurant\nbefore you\u2019ve\ntried it.\u201d\nThat was a strong lesson\nfrom a man, a total stranger,\nsitting at the table next to me,\nwhich ended our morning\ndebate over the much hyped-about The Breakfast Club a\nfew months back. For him, it\nwas his holy grail breakfast\nplace. For me, an overly\nhyped-up place with ridiculous queues serving average\nAmerican-style breakfast\ndishes.\nWhile I still have yet to visit\nThe Breakfast Club to this\ndate, his words had struck a\nspark of fire inside me \u2013 the\ncourage to try all these new\nand exciting restaurants in\nLondon, especially those I\nhave been wanting to visit,\nbut prevented by that prejudice I\u2019ve formed in my head.\nOne of those restaurants at\nthe top of my list was Duck\nand Waffle. The highest\nrestaurant in London residing\non the 40th\nfloor of the Heron\nTower. The restaurant that\nwas so arrogant you have to\nreserve your table two months\nin advance, despite it being\nopen 24/7. The restaurant\nthat I have always had a\nmajor grudge against for\nturning me away from a 7:30\nwalk-in attempt on a Wednesday morning.\nIt wasn\u2019t only their pure\narrogance that put out the\nflame of curiosity deep inside\nmy heart. It was the contrasting reviews from excited\ncaptions on how amazing\nthe food is with the glorious\nsunrise, to paying for the view\nrather than the only-average\nfood. These voices had been\ndebating in my head for\nmonths and months, kicking\nthe idea of visiting further\nand further to the back of my\nmind. But finally, I\u2019ve decided\nto find out for myself, with my\nown taste buds.\nIt was quite a spontaneous\ndecision. I was sitting at the\nback of the lecture theatre\nfeeling miserable for myself\nfor sitting through yet another\nhour of the lecturer\u2019s slow,\ndroning voice, and how I\ndeserved a nice breakfast to\ntreat myself. The next moment\nI found myself on Duck and\nWaffle\u2019s reservation page,\ndesperately clicking on every\nsingle date for the next 2\nmonths, in search for a slot at\na reasonable time among all\nthe \u201cWe apologise: there is\nno availability at that time.\u201d\nand a handful of 6am slots\n(6am is NOT reasonable). I\nlaughed at myself for putting\nin such effort, until the page\nloaded for the 20th\ntime\u2026\nLanded a table at 8:30am on\na Tuesday morning a week\naway.\nThat was like winning the\njackpot.\nThat morning, we dragged\nourselves out of bed bright\nand early, rubbed our\ngroggy, sleepy eyes in the\ncommuter-packed tube\njourney to Liverpool Street,\nand stared up the shiny, glass\nbuilding of the Heron Tower.\nWe entered the door to the\nreception of Duck and Waffle\nand Sushi Samba, and was\nmet by a hostess with an unexpectedly sloppy attitude, who\ntook my name and pointed\nus to the right \u2013 a security\nguard.\nI discreetly rolled my eyes as\nthe guard swiped his detector\nunder my armpit. Yup, arro-gance, check.\nNow, the fun part. The\nglass lift shot us straight up\nfrom ground to the 40th\nfloor\nlike those capsules in sci-fi\nmovies. The door opened to\na stylish bar, beautiful blue,\ntiled floors, and a handsome\nbartender who pointed to yet\nanother reception.\nWe were led further into the\nmain part of the restaurant: a\nmodern, spacious room with\ncrystal clear, floor-to-ceil-ing windows, sofas, marble\ntables and an open kitchen.\nWe were seated right by the\nwindow, over-looking the\nthick blanket of fog blanking\nout the view. (Typical British\nwinter weather.)\nWe made ourselves com-fortable, looking around at\nthe other diners who were all\nadhering to the strict dress\ncode. The room was half-empty (or half-full, if you are\nthe optimistic kind), relighting\nmy grudge for being shooed\naway from a walk-in. Maybe\nthey wanted to keep that\nprestigious, oh-we-don\u2019t-opento-random-people sort of\nimage?\nPutting that aside, we\nglanced over the menu and\nswiftly decided on two of\ntheir waffle dishes. For the\nsavoury, their signature duck\nand waffle, and for the sweet,\ntheir caramelized banana\nwaffle. Plus coffee to wake\nus up.\nOur waffles arrived at our\ntable in a moment, while the\ncoffee took their time (coffee\nended up just average so I\u2019ll\nskip that). Both dishes looked\nabsolutely amazing, or, in my\nwords, Instagrammable.\nThe duck and waffle was a\nsimple construction of half a\nwaffle with a duck leg confit,\nfried to a crispy, golden\nbrown, a glossy fried duck\negg on top and a little jug\nof mustard maple syrup on\nthe side. Wrapped inside the\ncrispy skin of the duck confit\nwas shreds of juicy, tender\nmeat, surprisingly not greasy.\nThe sweetness from the\nmaple syrup and the savoury\nduck was like a match made\nin heaven. The duck had\nsurpassed my prejudice and\nexpectations and earned itself\na round of applause. However, the waffle itself was just\nan average waffle, nothing\nexciting.\nThe caramelized banana\nwaffle was a bit of an anti-cli-max as it didn\u2019t have any of\nthe wow-factor compared\nto the former dish. It was a\nsimple dish of waffles with\ntheir house-made hazelnut and chocolate spread,\nsmooth vanilla ice cream and\na banana, split in half along\nits length, caramelized and\nskilfully balanced on top. Perhaps my expectations were\ntoo high \u2013 it was just waffles\nafter all.\nThirty minutes had barely\npassed and we were scraping\nthe last crumbs off our plates.\nDuck and Waffle, despite\nthe slightly unprofessional\nservice, was an eye-opening\ndining experience and is definitely worth a visit. Food-wise,\nstick to the duck and waffle \u2013\nquoting my lovely companion:\n\u201cThe restaurant is called that\nfor a reason.\u201d\nValentine\u2019s sweets\nTry to do something else for your special someone with this step-by-step guide for calorie-heavy\nsweets and you\u2019ll never again buy chocolate truffles!\nC\nan you smell\nit? Try again! I\nknow you can,\nbut maybe\nyou\u2019ve just got\nused to it as\nit\u2019s been here for some days\nalready: LOVE. Oh, yes,\nyou\u2019ve heard me right. In case\nyou didn\u2019t realise, Valentine\u2019s\nis coming in less than a week\nnow. And if you are alone, it\u2019s\ntime to worry \u2013 you cannot\nspend one more Valentine\u2019s\nalone. Again! If you are with\nsomeone, it\u2019s time to worry \u2013\nyou really want to make sure\nthat they do still love you as\nmuch as they did in the first\nday.\nAs it\u2019s said, the path to\nsomeone\u2019s heart is through\ntheir stomach, so you can\nmake sure that the love of\nyour life (this week) will know\nhow much you love her/\nhim by sharing some sweets.\nAnd because we are in the\nfood section here, it\u2019s easy to\nimagine that I don\u2019t propose\nyou to go and buy some\nfancy over-priced chocolates,\nbut to bake your love and\nsweat (maybe less sweat,\nmore love) into something\nspecial.\nChocolate truffles\nThis year was the first I\u2019ve\never tried to make such things\nand I loved them! I mean,\neverybody loved them \u2013 so\nmuch that there was none left\nafter two hours.

Keep in mind\nthat you don\u2019t have to completely melt it, but to soften it\na bit. At the same time, heat\nthe cream to a simmer. Add\nthe vanilla and cinnamon. If\nyou feel like it, you can add\nsome other flavours \u2013 mint,\nrum \u2013 but keep in mind that\nyou cannot mix everything so\nyou might need to prepare\ndifferent batches for different\nflavours.\nOn the top of chocolate,\nadd the heavy cream and stir\nuntil smooth. Let it cool a bit\nand then refrigerate it for two\nhours.\nTake the mixture out and,\nusing a teaspoon, roll out little\nballs of chocolate. Roll them\nin the cocoa powder and\nplace on baking paper \u2013 or\nany other kind of non-sticky\npaper. Place in the refrigerator overnight. At this point,\nyou might have to watch over\nit for the whole night so you\ncan make sure that they\u2019ll still\nbe there in the morning.\nAlso, keep in mind that you\nIngredients:\n6 tbsp melted unsalted butter\n1 cup chocolate (chips or\nchopped)\n2 cups flour\n1 cup sugar\n2 eggs\n1 tsp baking powder\n1 tsp baking soda\n1/3 cup cocoa powder\nNutella\n\u00bd tsp salt\n1 cup butter milk\n1/3 cup chocolate chips\n1 tsp cinnamon\ncan also roll them in chopped\nnuts or anything else, really.\nMaybe you\u2019d fancy some\npink decorations you find\neverywhere this time of the\nyear. Just don\u2019t overdo it!\nSimple is better in this case.\nNow, go and impress them!\nwater \u2013 this is how a real\nchef would do, but if you feel\nthat\u2019s too complicated, use\nthe always-there-when-you-need-it microwave. Stir from\ntime to time until completely\nmelted and smooth.\nFor the first step you\u2019ll\nneed a rather large bowl.\nWhisk together the flour,\nsugar, cocoa powder, baking\npowder and soda \u2013 you may\nwonder why you need them\nboth; you should go and do\nsome research, that\u2019s why\nyou are an Imperial student\n\u2013 salt and cinnamon. In\nanother bowl, whisk the eggs\nand the butter milk until well\ncombined. Add the melted\nchocolate and butter and mix\nuntil smooth.\nPour the liquid ingredients\nover the dry ones and mix\nwith a spatula. Make sure\nthat all the ingredients are\nwell incorporated.

I find\nmyself switching from Drizzy\nfan boy to Drizzy hater on\na regular basis. How many\nhip-hop artists could sell out\nthe O2 for so many dates?\nOn the other hand, his music\nhas infiltrated the mainstream\nto such an extent that his core\nfan base is starting to consist\nlargely of a group that don\u2019t\nappreciate many other hiphop artists. Is this good for the\nculture?\nAll of my questions disappeared as soon as the lights\ndimmed and the horns of\nTrophies started to blear.\nWhat ensued was an hour\nand a half of pure energy,\nwith the six god rattling off\ntune after tune, and the crowd\neating up every second of it.\nFrom performing the hooks of\nclassic hits such as Headlines,\nOver and The Motto to more\nrecent bangers, including\nFake Love and Hotline Bling,\nDrake\u2019s enthusiasm had\nonlookers jumping all night.\nDrake flexed his vocals on\nthe slower, more romantic\nFind Your Love and Feel No\nWays, and well as the more\nupbeat Work and Too Good.\nHe proclaimed, \u201cYou know\nyou have to play the RiRi\ntunes to make the gyal dem\nfeel sexy\u201d. He switched up\nthe vibe throughout, sensing\nwhen to play his more upbeat\nsongs yelling, \u201cI\u2019m tryna\ndo a show for the people, I\nain\u2019t tryna fuck nobody right\nnow!\u201d at his keyboard player.\nDrake\u2019s obsession with\nLondon and the UK grime\nscene was evidenced as\nhe brought London\u2019s Dave,\nGiggs and Kyla out to join\nhim on stage, much to the\naudience\u2019s excitement. Dave\njoined forces with Drake\nto perform their hit single,\nWanna Know Remix. Giggs\nwas the next guest, performing Whippin Excursion, and\nmaking Aubrey go full fan\nboy for the five minutes that\nhe was on stage.\nIn a brief intermission, we\nwere treated to a preview of\na Drake and Giggs\u2019 collaboration and a giant light-up\nglobe rose through the centre\nof the stage. Drake returned\nto the stage to perform Pop\nStyle leading nicely into\nKnow Yourself. The crowd\nwent off as Drake screamed\n\u201cI was running through the\nsix with my woes\u201d and it was\nby far the most hyped part of\nthe of the show. Drake ended\nthe show declaring, \u201cIf I die,\nImma die a legend\u201d.\nAndy Djaba\nTired of the same old songs, or just like listening to live music? The new music scene in London is\nvibrant and flourishing, beginning with the Roundhouse Rising Festival next week.\nP\nart of the allure of\nmoving to London\nfor music lovers\nis the incredible\naccess to up and\ncoming artists.\nMany times while living\nhere, I\u2019ve high-fived myself\nfor gaining hipster points\nafter discovering artists\nwho\u2019ve yet to break into the\ncharts. Vanity aside, the\nease with which Londoners\ncan listen to new sounds\nand find quality acts is\nexciting and inspiring.\nBut how to sort the wheat\nfrom the chaff? Not every\nartist at your local is going\nto be the next Jack Garratt.\nLuckily, there are passionate\npeople working in the\nindustry that do the hard part\nfor you.\nNext week is Roundhouse\nRising Festival at the Roundhouse, Camden. Not only\ndoes it host nine days worth\nof live music from multiple\ngenres, it holds workshops\nwith industry leaders to help\nemerging talent get an edge\non breaking. This year it\u2019s\ncelebrating the huge success\nof rapper Little Simz, who\nplayed the festival in 2014.\nThe following year she\nreleased her debut album,\nwhich reached number 20\non the UK R&B album charts,\nand she will be headlining the\nfestival this year.\nFor the acoustically prefer-enced, there\u2019s Sofar Sounds.\nA programme started in\n2009, it has spread from\nLondon to over 200 cities\nsongwriters and bands, which\nyou can enjoy while snuggled\nin your Primark onesie.\nKeeping your hipster card\nvalid in London can be a\nhard ask, especially when\nhalf your week is spent in\nlabs (don\u2019t take it from me,\nI never have labs), but don\u2019t\nlet that stop you from hearing\nincredible music from all over\nthe city. Fortunately, here in\nLondon, there\u2019s more to new\nsound than Spotify\u2019s Discover\nplaylist.\nTheo Farah\nworldwide.

An article detailing\nwhat went on at the event\nand the build-up to the day\nitself was published in felix\nlast week but since then the\nchair of the talk, Dr. Matthew\nWraith, and his students\nhave contested points in the\narticle (namely Palestinian\nSociety\u2019s statement). A piece\non the subject can be found in\nComment, on page 8.\nMost of the criticism stems\nfrom the statement issued by\nPalestinian Society that \u201cit is\nquite worrying that the College\ndid not think to invite an\nopposing view to help balance\nthe conversation themselves.\nThis would\u2019ve lead to a much\nmore open-minded and fruitful\ndiscussion with different\nperspective being expressed\u201d.\nDr. Wraith, who had a large\npart in the initial organisation\nof the event, has in response\ntold felix that he had in fact\nemailed Mohammed Snober,\nthe Palestinian Society\nPresident, with an offer to\nhelp in the organisation of the\nambassador\u2019s visit at the start\nof the process in October.\nWraith was advised by the\nEvents team to approach the\nrelevant societies but as he\ndidn\u2019t want it to be a one-sided event he approached\nPalestinian Society as well as\nIsraeli Society. He contacted\nPalSoc asking if they \u201cwould be\ninterested in taking an active\nrole in the organisation of this\nevent, helping to establish its\ncentral focus, to organise and\npublicise it beforehand and on\nthe day.\u201d\nHowever Wraith told felix\nhe received no reply. felix\nreached out to Palestinian\nSociety for comment and they\nfelt that they weren\u2019t explicitly\nasked to provide another\nspeaker. \u201cThe initial email\nproposed helping out with\norganising and publicising the\nevent and deciding the focus\nof the questions, rather than\nexpressing that the event was\nopen for an opposing speaker\nto be present to challenge\nthe rhetoric presented by the\nIsraeli ambassador (if this was\nthe purpose of the invitation\nwe feel it could\u2019ve been made\nclear)\u201d, said Mohammed\nSnober, Palestinian Society\nPresident.\nThe society\u2019s silence was\ndue to commitments by their\nmembers around that time,\nboth personal and educational\nwithSnoberadding\u201cWedidn\u2019t\nwant to commit to an event and\nattach the Palestinian society\u2019s\nname without our full focus\nand dedication.\u201d Palestinian\nSociety also felt that it wasn\u2019t\nwholly on them to provide\nthe opposing view: \u201cWhile it\nwas much appreciated that\nthe society was approached\nwe do not feel that our lack of\ninvolvement gives the College\na reason to not invite another\nspeaker.

But the\npleasure I took in eating\nit triggered a glitch of\nannoyance. I realised such\nfine nuances of taste and\ntexture are easily overlooked\nin today\u2019s world where\neasy access to and high\nabundance of high-energy,\npalatable, chemical-laden\nfoods is the norm. These are\nthe reasons that drive the\noverwhelming prevalence\nof obesity and metabolic\ndisease.\nA study published just two\nmonths ago in Frontiers in\nBehavioral Neuroscience\nshowed that it\u2019s just as easy to\npull oneself out of debilitating\njunk food habits as it is to get\nstuck in it, by examining the\neffect of food-paired environmental cues on food-seeking\nbehavior. With so much\neating done outside of the\nhouse, we are constantly\nbombarded with external\nstimuli to promote the purchase and consumption of\nfoods high in energy but low\nin micronutrients.\nThe two experiments\nreported in this particular\nexperiment each began with\nconditioning: non-deprived\nrats received repeated exposure to standard lab nosh,\nand another paired with\nhighly palatable junk foods\nsuch as Oreos, Pringles and\njelly snakes. A third set of rats\nwere food-deprived for instrumental training, where rats\ncould press levers to obtain\nsugary water or pellets in\norder to test the effect of environment on food consumption\nbeing either based on decisions or habitual. Perhaps not\nsurprisingly, experiment one\nfound that the rats on junk\nfood promoted habitual control over behavior, compared\nto a bland food context. The\nsecond experiment is what\nmakes this experiment novel,\nattempting to reverse this\nhabitual effect, this mindless\nsnatching of M&M\u2019s and\n\u201coh look they\u2019re all gone in\nten\u201d attitude, by exploring\nwhether the presentation of a\ndiscrete cue paired with food\nand its environment would\nrestore control over behavior\nwhen faced with junk food.\nIn the second experiment,\nthe rats underwent the same\nprocedures as in the first\nexperiment. However, this\ntime, distinct sound cues were\nplayed whenever rats were\nplaced in either junk-food or\nbland chow contexts, creating\nspecific environmental cues\nassociated with the differing\nfood types. The researchers\nfound that the cue played\nin the bland chow context\nimproved sensitivity to the\ndevaluation of food, when\nrats were then presented with\nan abundance to junk food\nafter having been fed. So\nthere you go: A sound cue\npaired with bland food is all\nit took to take rats out of a\nhabitual mode of behavior\nand back into a mind frame\nof better self-control. Of\ncourse, rats aren\u2019t all the\nsame physiologically or mentally as us humans, but this\nstill provides some insight into\nour relationship with food,\nproving we can control ourselves than we think. Another\nslice of insight derived from\nthese experiments: our natural inclination towards fatty or\nsweet foods are mostly envi-ronment-driven, not because\nour bodies are in dire need\n24/7 of all that high fructose\ncorn syrup. We can\u2019t always\nuse the excuse that our ances-tors, who were much more\nF\nact: Goats spin\nspider-webs.\nOK, slight embel-lishment. Science\ncan make goats that\nproduce spider silk in\ntheir milk.\nObviously having a few\ngoats minding their own\nbusiness is better than having\nmillions of spiders in a farm\nall viciously tearing each\nother\u2019s heads off \u2013 which\nis exactly what happened\nduring the initial efforts to\nmass-produce spider silk,\nsince apparently spiders are\nhighly territorial and don\u2019t\nplay well with others. But how\nto go about it?\nUsing a process known as\ngenetic modification, or splic-ing, DNA from spiders can\nbe artificially added to the\nDNA of goats \u2013 in particular.\nScientists have transferred\nthe genes required to spin silk\ninto our unsuspecting furry\nfriends to allow mass-produc-tion of an incredibly powerful\nmaterial. The elegant part is\nthat the gene is inserted in\nsuch a way that it is only activated during milk production\n\u2013 so the silk is only made in\nmilk, not in any other part of\nthe goat where it might cause\ndisease.\nThose who despise all things\nspider might wonder why\nyou\u2019d bother making massive\nquantities of cobwebs? Turns\nout spider silk is actually a\n\u2018supermaterial\u2019 \u2013 use it to\nmake \u2018Biosteel\u2019, kevlar vests\nand artificial ligaments\u2026 in\nfact, I think it deserves its own\npost.\nAnother one of Mr. Aran\nShaunak\u2019s Little Bites of\nScience\nWebof\nLies\n\\\\ It\u2019s just as easy\nto pull oneself out\nof debilitating junk\nfood habits as it is to\nget stuck in it \\\\\ndeprived than we are today,\nneeded those foods to keep\nthem going.\nAnd you know what? It\u2019s\nOK to have junk food, my\nown love for sweets underpinning my passion for both food\nblogging and science writing.\nThat slice of souffl\u00e9 cheesecake I just had is now gone.\nIt\u2019s simply understanding the\nfactors that drive obesity,\nthis serious impediment to\nour future peace on Earth,\nthat\u2019s an absolute necessity\nnow. This all sounds quite\noverly dramatic, and maybe\nI am loopy, but let\u2019s revert\nquite overly dramatic, and\nmaybe I am loopy, but let\u2019s\nrevert our focus to appreciation of the small pleasures,\nlike this homemade cake,\nor pineapple tart (Chinese\nNew Year is still on a roll), or\nsavouring a book and scone\nat a caf\u00e9 instead of hankering\nafter McDonald\u2019s and only\nMcDonald\u2019s.\n\\\\ With so much\neating done outside\nof the house, we\nare constantly\nbombarded with\nexternal stimuli\nto promote the\npurchase and\nconsumption of\nfoods high in\nenergy but low in\nmicronutrients \\\\\nAlexandra Lim looks at the science behind our cravings, and why it\u2019s easier to\nstop bingeing than we think\n\\\\ Fine nuances of\ntaste and texture are\neasily overlooked\nin today\u2019s world of\nhigh-energy and\nchemical laden\nfoods \\\\\nT\nhe past three weeks\nhave meant that\nthe previously\nenjoyable activity of\nlooking at Facebook\nhas instead become\na daily battle of emotions\nas I brace myself to learn of\nanother Trump shocker. A\ntravel ban on 7 countries,\nbanning organizations from\nspeaking to the public and\na petty fight over who had\nthe most fans \u201cever\u201d at the\nstrange inauguration thing\n\u2013 the headlines just keep\non coming from the Trump\nestablishment.\nIt is nigh on impossible\namongst all this mess to\ndetermine what Trump\u2019s\nintentions are for his time as\nPresident, and that includes\nwhat he intends for US\nscience. Demanding lists of\nclimate scientists and electing\nclimate-sceptic Scott Pruitt\nto lead the EPA are moves\nthat add up to form a clear\npicture of a president with a\nreal agenda about climate\nscience. But could these\nactions be indicative of wider\ngovernment policies to come?\nCan we expect more interfering from Trump?\nAt the heart of all science\nis the quest to determine\ntruth and fact. This does not\nappear to be a dogma that\nThe Donald subscribes to. If\nTrump has such little respect\nfor these two concepts (cue\nKelly-Anne Conway) it is\nvery unlikely that he sees the\nconcept of science as having\nmerit in its own right.\nMuch more likely is that\nTrump sees science as\nmerely a means to an end,\nspecifically the means to his\nend of an industrial America.\nScience programmes that\nhave the ability to provide\ninstantly useful technologies for Trump\u2019s favoured\nindustries are likely to enjoy\na boom under Trump, whilst\nthose sciences deemed to be\ninterfering or (god forbid) not\nuseful will be ridiculed and\nside-lined.\nThis process, of picking and\nchoosing sciences to fund\npurely on their perceived\nusefulness in furthering political agendas, has been seen\nbefore. Under Stalin the USSR\nhad strict criteria for science\nit liked and science it didn\u2019t.\nMendelian genetics and other\nbiological sciences were\nbanned for being un-Marxist\npractices supported by the\nbourgeoisie. Statistical mathematics was abandoned and\nthe law of standard deviation\nlabelled a \u2018false theory\u2019. Early\ncybernetics was \u2018capitalist\npseudo-science\u2019 and quantum\nphysics \u2018idealist\u2019.\nThese clampdowns on\n\u2018ideological\u2019 science occurred\nat the same time as the expansion of the Soviet nuclear\nand astronomy programmes.\nThe glorification of certain\nsciences seemingly excused\nthe brutal rubbishing of\nscience that fell outside of the\nUSSR\u2019s ideals, leaving some\nRussian sciences years behind\nthe rest of the world. Could\nthe same thing be about to\nhappen in the land of the\nScience won\u2019t be Trumped\nSara Hamilton reports on China\u2019s new approach towards environmental legislation\nI\ncan\u2019t speak for everyone,\nbut when I think of\nChina in relation to the\nenvironment, an image of\ncoal and smog-full Beijing,\nwith millions of citizens\nrunning around in protective\nanti-pollution masks, springs\nto mind. Henry Wang, in his\ntalk Energy and Environment\nGrowth Strategies hosted by\nthe Imperial Energy Society,\nbrought a ray of optimism in\nthe future of China\u2019s energy\nmix and environmental\nlegislation.\nWang began his talk with\nan overview of the global\nenergy, environment &\nclimate change strategies\nworldwide, summarizing\nmany of the facts that are\nfrequently discussed as part\nof this \u2018great energy debate\u2019\nwe seem to constantly\nhear about. He underlined\nprojections showing the\nexpected global energy\ndemand to rise 50% in the\nnext 20-30 years, coupled\nwith the ambitious aim set in\nthe Paris Climate Conference\nto limit global temperature\nrise to 2\u00b0C by the end of the\ncentury, corresponding to the\nextremely limited CO2 atmospheric concentration of 450\nppm. Although oil is expected\nto remain in the energy mix\nand provide at least half\nthis demand, the renewable industry is predicted to\nboom, doubling its production\nwithin 20 years to make this\ndecarbonation possible.\nAlthough some countries\n*cough* thanks Trump\n*cough* are showing limited\naction to meet their commitment to these ambitious\nglobal initiatives against\nclimate change, the Chinese\ngovernment, Wang claims, is\nshowing promising progress\nin accomplishing significant\nchange. A few months ago,\nChina recently released\na finalized version of its\n13th\nFive-Year-Plan holding\nimportant implications for the\nfuture of its energy mix and\nsustainable growth. Through\nthis plan, the government has\nset out to reduce its carbon\nintensity by 15% , following\nthe success in the previous\nPlan which achieved a similar\nreduction. As part of this\ngoal, the Chinese government\nhas committed more than US\n$120 billion in an inter-city\nhigh-speed rail. The plan also\nsets out to accomplish ambitious targets in air-pollution\ncontrol, requiring hundreds of\ncities to meet \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018excellent\u2019 standards 80% of the\ntime, meaning they must score\nbelow 100 in China\u2019s Air\nQuality Index. Furthermore,\nstricter limits on the emissions\nof SO2 and NOx have been\nplaced, as well as those of\nVolatile Organic Compounds\n\\\\ China has\nintroduced new\npoliecies to help\nreduce its carbon\nintensity \\\\\nChina charges ahead environmentally\n(VOCs). Finally, policies have\nalso been introduced to tackle\ntwo of China\u2019s most serious\nbut less heard of environmental issues \u2013 water and soil\npollution.\nIt hence seems that the\nenvironmentally endangered China we know from\nnews broadcasts might soon\nbecome a place of the past.\nMaybe time for some of the\ncountries on this side of the\nworld to follow suit?\n\\\\ The world cannot\nafford to let science\nbe repressed again\n\\\\\nfree?\nWith an administration that\nsays science should be left to\nthe scientists, whilst simultaneously electing anti-vaccine\nactivists to government health\npanels, this is a real possibil-ity. But this time there would\nbe one major difference. In\nthe years since the 1950\u2019s,\nscience has become ever\nmore defined by international\ncollaboration and data shar-ing. If scientific programmes\nare attacked in America the\ndetrimental effects will be\nfelt across the globe. For\nthat reason we should carry\non steeling ourselves to sift\nthrough the Facebook rants\nand offensive tweets, looking\nfor changes to American\nscience policy. The world can\nnot afford to let science be\nrepressed again.\n\\\\ Programmes that\ncan provide useful\ntechnologies for\nTrump\u2019s favoured\nindustries are likely\nto enjoy a boom \\\\\nAgnes Donnelly\n\n"

But Truvada\ndoes so much more that carry\nantiretroviral properties. It is\ncharged with symbolism and\npacked with historic meaning.\nApproved by the FDA in the\nearly noughties, it is one of\nthe first \u2018combination\u2019 treatments developed to combat\nHIV and the second combination treatment that was\ndeveloped without the highly\ntoxic AZT. For many HIV\npatients, Truvada was and still\nis a synonym to life. Before\n1997, and despite the development of multiple drugs,\nHIV treatments were partly\nefficacious monotherapies,\nmeaning treatment would\nconsist of a single drug. As\nour understanding of the virus\nimproved we realised that\nmonotherapies allowed the\nvirus to mutate and develop\nresistance, which explained\nthe poor results.\nHowever, when the first\ncombination drug was\napproved by the FDA in 1997,\nlife expectancies improved\ngreatly, allowing HIV positive\nmen and women to live\nlonger, fuller lives. And new\nmedical developments have\nbeen reducing side-effects\nand improving quality of life\never since.\nIn 2004 Truvada became\nFDA approved, adding to our\nmedical arsenal against the\nvirus, and having it incorporated in PEP (Post Exposure\nProphylaxis). In the case of\nPEP, Truvada is administered\n(now in conjunction with\nraltegravir from the NHS)\nafter a high risk encounter\n(unprotected sex with a\npositive partner) or a medical\naccident (accidentaly getting\nstabbed with a contaminated\nneedle).\nIn recent years Truvada has\nalso been used on its own as\na preventative treatment for\nHIV and is now commonly\nused by many gay men. It\nlooks like one Truvada pill a\nday keeps the doctor away.\nOr at least reduces new\ntransmissions of HIV by 80\npercent, according to the\n2016 PROUD study. When\none in seven gay men in\nLondon have HIV, getting the\nvirus becomes a statistical\ninevitability. But Truvada has\nreally quickly made the prospect of a future without HIV a\nlot more concrete. For a lot of\ngay men, Truvada has come\nto mean hope.\nSadly it\u2019s also becoming\na symbol of the social\ninequalities that run deep in\nevery community, including\nthe gay community. In the\nUSA, the drug was approved\nfor preemptive use in 2012.\nSince then, gay men and\nother high risk groups can\nbe prescribed Truvada in the\nform of PrEP (Pre Exposure\nProphylaxis). But whereas\nPrEP is covered by most\nhealth insurance plans and in\nsome states the drug is freely\navailable to those who are\ndiagnoses in America come\nfrom African-Americans.\nThere\u2019s another way in\nwhich Truvada brings back\nmemories from the 80s, as it\nreminds us of the marginali-sation of the gay community.\nIn the UK, the adoption\nand prescription of PrEP\nwas preceded by years of\ncampaigning and a legal\nbattle against the NHS. In\nthe meantime many gay men\nlooked for cheap alternatives\nabroad, putting their health at\nrisk and conducting their own\nclinical studies out of neces-sity. Likewise in the early\nyears of the HIV pandemic,\nthe LGBT community was\nforced to take matters into its\nown hands. Through activism\nand organised action, they\nmade governments pour\nresources into HIV research\nand even forced the FDA to\nspeed up and alter the drug\nauthorisation procedure, all\nwhile trying new illegal drugs,\nin hope of finding something,\nanything, that might counter\nthe virus.\nI talked to AJ Pittman, who\nlaunched IWantPrepNow, an\nonline resource for anyone\ntrying to access PrEP in the\nUK, and he agrees. \u201cPeople\nwere doing this in the 80s.\nIt\u2019s 35 years later and governments and world health\nLef Apostolakis\norganisations still haven\u2019t\nlearned. HIV massively\ndisproportionately affects\nmarginalised communities that\nare easily ignored.\u201d\nIt also raises questions\nabout the future of safe sex.\nWill PrEP cause the abandonment of condom use or has\nTruvada become a symbol\nof empowerment? \u201cPeople\non Truvada are being safe\nand taking responsibility of\ntheir health\u201d says Pittman.\n\u201cSome people go on Truvada\nbecause they\u2019re already not\nusing condoms and some\npeople might use condoms a\nbit less but at the end of the\nday healthcare professionals\nadvise it\u2019s used in conjunction\nwith condoms. Besides there\nare many other STIs to be\nworried about.\u201d\nStill, this doesn\u2019t stop\nsome members of the gay\ncommunity being labelled\nas \u2018Truvada Whores\u2019. When\nasked about the slur Pittman\nis quick to dismiss it. \u201cNo, fuck\nyou, I\u2019m actually being safe\u201d\nhe says cheerfully. \u201cPeople\nwear it proudly on their\nt-shirts. Truvada Whore is a\nderogatory term that we\u2019re\nreclaiming.\u201d Maybe if the\nNHS sold \u2018Truvada Whore\u2019\nt-shirts it could fund PrEP.\n\\\\ For many HIV\npatients, Truvada is\na synonym to life \\\\\n\\\\ One Truvada pill\na day keeps the\ndoctor away \\\\\n\\\\ HIV massively\ndisproportionately\naffects marginalised\ncommunities that are\neasily ignored \\\\\n\\\\ People on\nTruvada are being\nsafe and taking\nresponsibiliy for their\nhealth \\\\\n7\n0\n1\nunable to afford it, there still\nremain millions of uninsured\nAmericans to whom the cost\nof PrEP can be as high as\n13,000$ a year. Similarly in\nthe UK, Truvada is only free\nif it\u2019s part of emergency PEP.\nGetting it pre-emptively as\npart of PrEP at the moment\nrequires shelling out \u00a3400 a\nmonth. This can disproportionately impact the unemployed,\nthe disadvantaged, the ethnic\nminorities, the same way it\nhas done since the very beginning of the HIV pandemic,\nwhen by 1990, 30 percent\nof reported cumulative AIDS\ncases occurred in black men.\nToday 39 percent of new HIV\n\n"

For so many years of my life,\nI lived in a state of confusion.\nTo finally discover people that\nshared the same interests and\npassions was incredible. I\u2019ve been able\nto make the lifelong friends that everyone\nsaid would exist, based on shared\nexperience and camaraderie. It\u2019s also\nmade me much more aware of societal\nissues \u2013 it sounds a little selfish but it\u2019s\nmuch easier to get fired up and engaged\nwith anti-discrimination efforts when you\nknow people personally affected. The UK\nis, honestly, one of the best places to be\ntrans. The healthcare system isn\u2019t perfect\nby any means, but they\u2019re doing the best\nwith the limited resources that they have.\nLondon especially has been wonderful\nto me. When you\u2019re very self conscious\nabout your appearance, one of the most\nheartwarming things is when you step\nonto a tube after agonising about stepping\noutside for days and no one bats an eyelid.\nI know some people criticise London for\npeople being rude and unsociable, but if\nyou\u2019re in a position where you just want\nto be yourself without causing a fuss,\nit\u2019s really not a bad thing at all. No one\nminds, or cares. I never really fitted in at\nschool, and I don\u2019t know if I fit in better\nnow, but there are so many more people\nand the negative ones don\u2019t matter as\nmuch once you find or make a space that\nyou can call your own and support people\nThe LGBT\ncommunity\nis inherently\nflawed\nElizabeth Windo is cynical of the\ncommunity's very basis\nwith similar experiences that\nyou care about. IQ, Imperial\u2019s\nLGBT society, has undergone\nseveral changes in this area \u2013\nlast year the position of trans\n& gender variant officer was\nintroduced for the first time.\nSeveral other universities, such\nas UCL and Kings, have done\nthe same, and have hosted\ninter-university events which\nreally increases the size of the\ncommunity. I think, for better or\nfor worse, the notion of being\ntrans is now firmly entrenched\nT\nhe LGBT community\nis a misnomer.\nIt\u2019s a group of\ndisparate people\npushed together by\nsocietal pressure,\nand pressure makes things\nexplosive. You only need to\nlook at the agenda pushed\nby \u2018gender critical\u2019 feminists,\nor the right wing ideologies\nespoused by the \u2018dangerous\nfaggot\u2019 Yiannopoulis to see\nthat any pretence of unity is\nfounded on a certain level of\nrespectability politics. In wider\nsociety, plenty of people\npay lip service to tolerance\nbut do not let that extend to\nactually causing or being\npart of change, reaching\nthe stage of \u2018well, I guess I\nwouldn\u2019t disown my kids if\nthey ended up like that\u2019 and\nnever progressing that much\nfarther. A community doesn\u2019t\nexist because the name exists.\nIt exists because you fight for\nit, because you stick up for the\npeople you care about and\nlove and hope they would do\nthe same. It exists because it\u2019s\nall some people have.\nThe trans community itself is\na fundamentally malformed\nconstruct, formed from people\nS\nV\nin the public consciousness.\nEven apps like Tindr now\nincorporates gender options\nthat are no longer just the\nbinary ones. People really\ntry to get it, even when it\u2019s\ntricky, and I\u2019m so thankful for\nthat. I\u2019m proud to be part of\nthis, and to have met so many\ninspiring people.\nAm I happier, after going\nthrough this process? Yes.\nWould I do it all again? In a\nheartbeat.\nwith nothing in common save a shared\nexperience of dysphoria. The intent of\nthe vast majority of trans people is to\neventually disappear from this group, to\nascend to the point where they can live in\nsociety without ever once thinking about\ntheir past. For this reason, any community\nthat exists is made up of the early birds\nhunting for worms, and those a few years\ndown the road that aren\u2019t quite able to\nascend out of it yet.\nIt\u2019s a place where there\u2019s the constant\nlooming shadow of suicide and violence,\nwhere people go missing and noone\nquite knows what happened \u2013 did they\nascend, tap out of life, were they caught\non the street and beaten to death? It\u2019s\na place where you\u2019re just a craigslist ad\naway from finding sex work from some\ncloseted forty year old who subverts his\nhomosexual proclivities by saying \u2018traps\ndon\u2019t count, right?\u2019. This sex work being\na stand in for a more steady job, denied\nby institutional discrimination that doesn\u2019t\nwant to deal with the hassle of hiring a\npotentially mentally ill trans person, with\nthe funds going towards rent and the\nmedical treatments required to one day be\nable to reintegrate with society and deal\nwith the self hatred and dysphoria.\nIt\u2019s a place that is mine, and I will fight\nfor the continued survival of everyone in it.\nAm I happier now, after going through this\nprocess? Maybe. Would I do it all again? I\ndon\u2019t know if I ever had a choice.\n\\\\ I've been able to\nmake the lifelong\nfriends everyone\nsaid would exist,\nbased on shared\nexperience and\ncamaraderie \\\\\n\\\\ A community doesn't exist\nbecause the name exists.

More\nspecifically, it explicitly\ndecriminalised some\noffences, including nepotism\nand official misconduct\nresulting in financial\ndamage under 200,000\nRON (roughly \u00a338,000). It\nwas initially supposed to be\neffective immediately, but\nwas soon revised to only take\neffect ten days later.\nPeople across the country\nwent into the streets in the\nmiddle of that very night;\nthere were 15,000 in\nBucharest alone, asking for\nthe government\u2019s resignation.\nIt was only the next day they\nfound out that a temporary\nreplacement government\nwould not have the power\nto repeal the decree.\nThe crowds immediately\n\\\\ It seems unbelievable to\nthe Romanian government\nthat the people have\norganised so well \\\\\nchanged their requests to\nexplicitly asking for repeal,\nfollowed by resignation.\nThe press conference held\non Wednesday was also a\nfuelling disaster. Avoiding\nquestions seemed to be the\ntheme of the event, as the\nMinistry of Justice replied\nwith \u201cNext question\u201d a\ngrand total of 24 times. The\ngovernment did supposedly\nrepeal the decree on the\n5th\nof February, following\na protest that had already\ngrown beyond the country\u2019s\nborders. However, it appears\ndoubtful that the repeal is\nvalid. Additionally, they\nimmediately introduced the\nsame law for parliamentary\ndebate, where the leading\nparty also holds the majority\nof seats.\nThroughout these events,\nRomanians have surprised\nthemselves and each other.\nThey are accustomed to the\nless than elegant view that\nWestern Europe generally\nholds of their country and\npeople. They also take pride\nin their nation\u2019s historical\nachievements. It is the latter\nfeeling that has provided the\nenergy necessary during the\npast couple of weeks.\nRomania remembers\nviolence. So when a certain\nfootball gallery was sent to\nagitate the mass of protesters\nin Bucharest, to give cause\nfor criticism, the people\ndetached themselves from\nthe violent group. When\na few run out of patience\nafter several nights in a row\nof standing and shouting\nin the cold, others calmed\nthem down quickly. They\nsupported and protected\neach other.\nIt seems unbelievable to the\nRomanian government that\nthe people have organised\nso well. So unbelievable,\nin fact, that government\nofficials have speculated\nthat they have been paid to\nprotest. However, it is solely\nthrough social media and\nword of mouth that these\nprotesters have organised\nand kept informed. It only\ntook a couple of people\nwith knowledge of the law,\nreading the decree and\nexplaining it, for it to spread\nlike wildfire.\nIt is clear that Romanians\nare aware of how corrupt\ntheir politicians are, and\nthey appear to have lost\nhope as a result. It is why\ntoo many choose not to\nvote at all. That is obviously\nthe wrong decision, as the\nconsequences are painfully\nclear now. However, they\nhave now \u201cwoken up\u201d as\none of their main slogans\ndirectly states. Moreover,\nthey are fighting against the\noverwhelming corruption in\na rather traditional manner.\nIt is often in Romanian culture\nand history that tragedies\nare transformed into\n'tragicomics' so as to better\ncope. It comes as no surprise\nthen that the protests have\nshown humourous slogans\nand puppets representing\n\\\\ Formerly\ncommunist Romania\nis seeing its largest\nprotest since the fall\nof the regime \\\\\nthe political individuals at\nthe core of this discontent.\nSocial media also seems\nto be equal parts serious\ndiscussions and memes.\nI wish I could be home for\nthese events. I only attended\nthe protests in London on\nFriday and Saturday, and I\nhad not expected too much\nenergy. However, I am both\nashamed and happy to say\nthat I underestimated the\nanger that unites us. Being\naway from home has not\nkilled our roots.\nIt was during the evening\nhours of Saturday that I\nfound myself protesting next\nto a gentleman with the\nsomewhat classic look of\na middle-aged bohemian.\nI had not paid attention at\nfirst, but amongst the shouts\nall around me, I overheard\nthat he had attended both the\nrevolution of December 1989\nand the Mineriad of June\n1990. It is a particular sort\nof pain I felt then; the kind\nthat arises when I'm eminded\nthat the people who have\nparticipated in those events,\nhoping for a better future,\nare still here to witness what\nis happening now.\nThe communist era of\nRomania has become a\nleitmotif in our culture. Some\nmiss the good old times,\nalthough most vow it will\nnever happen again. We\nhave either lived through it or\nbeen raised hearing about it.\nHowever, reading coverage\nof these weeks\u2019 events in the\nBritish media, I saw Romania\ndescribed as \u201can unlikely\nbeacon of democracy.\u201d\nWhile flattering, I disagree\nwith the sentiment. It is\nperhaps through the tragedy\nof our past that we are more\nlikely to fight for our present.\n\\\\ I am both ashamed\nand happy to say that\nI underestimated the\nanger that unites us \\\\\n\n"
