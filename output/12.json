    "content": "2 FELIX PROFILE\u2014 PROF. SAUNDERS\nIt is popularly supposed that to be a professor\nand to be a crank are identical states. Popular\nsupposition also prescribes that a professor be be-spectacled, distant, fragile and austere, all these\nqualities being inseparable from that studious musty\nwisdom which seems so unattainable to the struggling\nstudent, and yet e sent i al for academic success. How\nreassuring it is for i the student to find that popular supposition is confounded by the undeniable\npresence in this corner of the Scientific World of\na Professor, large in form and large in outlook,\nfond of the Good Things of life, who is an accomplished sportsman, a success in his academic sphere\nand, moreover, a counsellor whose sunny countenance\ndispels fear and the awe which stifles discussion,\nand provides the understanding which passes on to\nknowledge.\nthe Bean of City and Guilds does not regret\nhaving been educated at Trinity College, Cambridge;\nin fact he is one of the foremost of those who advocate the University as opposed to the Technical\nSchool education. The latter he says is not a 'complete' education. The truth of this is well\nborne out by his own rapid and diverse success.\nFrom early beginnings as Lecturer in Applied Mathematical Physics at Imperial College, Professor\nSaunders developed the hitherto almost unexplored\nfield of Heat Transmission and became a valuable\n\"b off in\" in the recent war when he was on loan to\nthe Directorate of Turbine Engine Research, a member of the aeronautical Research Council and\nchairman of the Power Plants Committee. He is still chairman of several committees at the Ministry of\nSupply and the Admiralty and is a member of the\nMechanical Engineering Research Board; he has published many original papers on his subject and, of\ncourse, his Book, compiled in collaboration with\nDr. Fishenden, which i a e confesses is the only worthwhile work on the subject.\nBut this is the sort of thing one expects of\nProfessors; they are supposed to be brilliant. However, one does not expect him to have a Bronze\nMedal for skiing, to be a keen tennis player, an\naccomplished pianist and a magician. No, these are\nnot the standard professorial attributes, but those\nwho know him find these attributes not so very sur-p rising. It seems the Dean .is 1'or tuna. te in having\ncommand of himself to such an extent as to be capable of complete relaxation. Never does his face\nshow the harassed, drawn look associated with high\npressure study and thought; his aspect is rather\nthat of a tennis player who has just won three\nstraight sets and is ready for more, or that of the\nskier flushed with pleasure at the end of a long run.\nThe Professor is essentially a family man. A close friend of his has said that his son and two\ndaughters in their Surrey home are indeed fortunate\nto have such a father; and an un ostentatious family\nman he appears to all who meet him. In the lecture\ntheatre he has that same personal touch that one can\nimagine him using when operating his son's model\nrailway, telling his family what to do in the garden,\nor producing magic before a small audience. ( He is to lecture to the Radio Society on Magic in December - it now seems indisputable that those valve\nthings and bits of wire are really just magic after\nall!) One may say that Professor Saunders is in\nhimself the answer to those who advocate sheer\nbrown bagging; single ness of purpose combined with\na multiplicity of personal interests is surely a good guide to a successful and happy career.\nREFECTORY COMMITTEE\nThe Refectory Committee held its 96th meeting last\nMonday.\nThe Committee iv is hit to be .v now n that the situation\nregarding College meals is under constant review. As is well\nknown the ref eo tory made a considerable loss last year and\nthe situation, though improved, is still serious. The Committee is always glad to hear from members of the College who\nhave any constructive ideas to put forward.. Letters may be\nplaced in the Suggestions Box (inside the Lower Dining Hall,\nnear the doors) or members of the Committee may he contacted\npersonally. These are: Chairman, Admiral Hall, v/ Chairman,\nJ.P. Levy; and Prof.Pippard, Derek Allen, Derek Coomber, Miss\nJune Mahon, Peter Haskell,Peter Hayward and John Rambaut.\nThe Rector is an ex-off io io member of the Committee,while Dr.\nHoward and ic r.i>o wry are co-opted members.\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nLetters are invited on any and every subject.\nThey should be as short as possible and in no case\nlonger than 200 words. The Editor takes no responsibility for the opinions expressed by corre sp on dents.\nGeophysics Dept.\nR.C.S. To the Editor of Felix. 27 Oct. 1950\nSir,\nWe now have a Liberal Group of respectable size\nin the Political Society and the Socialist Group\nseems at last on the point of deciding if it is\n(a) Communist, (b) Labour or (c)a living proof of\nthe fundamental identity of these parties. We have\nalso had a particularly exuberant challenge from\nProfessor Levy. It therefore seems that when things\nget sorted out we are in for some political fun this\nterm. May I on behalf of the Liberal Group say \"Yes\nplease\", and that are ready for anything. We are\nparticularly anxious to have a go at the collectivist left from the Red Dean ( Dr. Hewlett Johnson I mean, of course! ) downwards, and refute their particular political ph log is ton theory. We are also\nready to discuss policy with the Tory Group - ours,\nor theirs if they can find any.\nHowever, more of this anon.\nYours faithfully,\nJohn Osborne.\nI.C. Eostel.\n22nd October 1950.\nTo the Editor of Felix.\nSir,\nIn accordance with your invitation for modification of the form for the letter home, may I suggest that the phrase 'your erring son1 be changed to 'your erring son/daughter'.\nAfter all, there are at least 42 daughters in\nthe College at the moment and their interests\nshould not be neglected.\nYours faithfully,\nII.

    "content": "0 FELIX SAILING\nAt a recent meeting the following officers\nware elected:\nCommodore: A.B. Foster\nVice Commodore: E.G. Crossley\nHon. Sec: B.J. Cory Hon, Treasurer: T.J. Hunt\nSince beginning of term great activity could\nbe seen at the sailing grounds - one Firefly has\nbeen completely re varnished and the other will be\nstarted on soon. The hack dinghy \"Impshee\" is at\nlast able to sail thanks to 9 months \"hard labour\"\n(not to be confused with magistrates' sentence)\nand is for the use of all beginners - especially\nall day on Sundays.\nA number of talks by em mine nt yachtsmen are\nbeing arranged, the next one being on Tuesday,Nov.\n21st, when Capt. Ryder V.G., M.P. will talk about\nsome of his many sailing experiences including the\nsailing of the Tai-Mo-3han from China to England\nand as commander of the \"Campeltown\" which rammed\nthe St. Nazaire dock in1942. HOCKEY\nThe loss of Players to the university trials had its effect on Club play during the first few\nfixtures, but the teams are now showing some signs\nof order. A weakened first XI which played against\nKing's College and old Dunstablians displayed lit&e of the teamwork and guile of old, and in particular\nthe drawn game against King's is best forgotten.\nHowever, with a full team out against Reading University (save the loss of P. Juste sen and Ted Green\nto U. L.H.C.) an extremely keen and clean game resulted on a lively pitch. Improved combination in attack and steadiness in defence were evident in the _IC team and only a firm Reading def eno e kept\nthe\"score down to one goal.\n\"Uncle kac\" is busy training hi3 new recruits\nin the second XI and the performance of his team\nagainst Old Dunstablians augurs well for the Club's good reputation. This game was rather unfortunately\nlost following a penalty bully.\nThe third and fourth teams have put up good\nperformances in spite of the progressive effects of\nteam changes in the higher orders. It should be\nstated however that the continuance of the fourth\nXI is dependent on consistent support from Club\nmembers who should think of this before crossing\noff for any game.\nTHE SABIN TANKARD\nSaturday afternoon at Putney brought that cold\ngrey autumn weather, when oarsmen would much rather\nhuddle close to the fire and glance through \"Ken\nOnly\", than get soaked by a high tide. Further apprehension was caused among the Sabin crew by the\nfact that the oarsman at 4 had to drop out at the\nlast moment. In consequence, when 6'2\" of Peter\nSharpe ( C&G) turned up to work off the effects of\nthe previous evening with a little gentlemanly ex-er c is e, he was promptly ordered into the crew to\nmake up the numbers.\nFour VIII's were entered for this regatta,\nwhich gave us one heat and the final. The toughest\nopposition was King's College, which our crew had\ndrawn in their first heat. This gave them no chance\nof at; a as y race in which to acc lim at is e the substitute, and in fact it turned out to be even closer\nthan anticipated.\nFrom the start at Crabtree Wharf the two crews\nwent off dead level, but whereas King's soon\nlength ed out, IC seemed unable to settle down and\nstruck a higher rating over the whole course. For\nmore than half a mile each crew struggled to get\nahead, but neither could lead by more than a few\nfeet nor hold even that for long. They rounded the\nFulham bend still level,with King's in the better\nwater, and then both VIII's spurted. Hugh Metcalfe\nat stroke rallied his crew well and more by guts\nthan style they took half a length off their opponents before the finish. In the final we met Vesta Rowing Club. Our\ncrew, rowing much more steadily than in their first race, were able to draw away from their rivals and\nwith the help of clever co xing by \"Taffy\" Thomas,\nthey won by a length \"and so retained the Sabin\nTankard for the third consecutive year.

    "content": "GUILDS\nOn the evening of October 2o th Guilds Freshers\nassembled in the Upper Dining Hall for their annual\nbuffeting, many of them hoping, after seeing one of\nthe posters advertising the event, to see a horizontal Felix still manfully supping his beer from\nthe barrel. In this (but, we hope, only this) they\nwere disappointed, for your correspondent understands that he remained vertical late into the\nnight.\nThe buffet was advertised as \"6 for 6.3o\", but your correspondent, arriving at about 6.3o after helping the principal speakers to calm their\nnerves with a pint of beer in the President's room, found that the motley throng had already disposed of all the food and most of the free beer;\nfrom which it may be deduced that our Freshers are\npunctual, starved, broke and thirsty - only the\nfirst of which is unusual.\nThe President, John Rambaut, clad in his\nrobe3 of office, welcomed the guests, including the\nrepresentative of the Great Unemployed - his predecessor - and called on David Allen to propose the\nhealth of the Freshers. This he did with tao t and\ngrace, exhorting them, as they will continue to be\nexhorted until they leave, to neglect nothing in\nfavour of their studies, and ignoring the fact that\nby this time the health of many of them was in\njeopardy.\nJohn Hall replied on behalf of the Freshers\nwith a few well chosen words, fluidly delivered.\nThen, with an ease that belied his aar ried state, arose on the table the Distinguished Old\nGentralian, Peter Foster, v; ho proposed with his usual aplomb and wit the toast of the College,\ncoupled with the name of the Dean. His remarks on\nthe College, and particularly those on the convenient nature of the architecture of the hall, quickly drew shouts of laughter from his delighted\naudience, laughter that was only surpassed when he\nproceeded to deal with the Dean - although it must\nbe admitted.that the character he sketched bore\nlittle resemblance to this week's profile. Professor Saunders in replying was left with\nlittle to say, and wisely contented himself With a parting sally at Peter Epater and a few expressions\nof felicity find welcome*\nThe important ou sines s of teaching the Freshers and the President the Boomalaka was ably conducted by the two past Presidents who were present,\nafter which the learners gave a satisfactory per-form ance, and the company returned to their spiritual home to render the night hideous with bawdy\nsong. Fortunately this cannot be reported in detail\nas your correspondent returned to the pin.\nIt is understood that Q.A. are now seriously\nreconsidering the advisability of holding a. formal\ndance on the same night as the Guilds Freshers\nBuffet.\nOwe suspect that our correspondent is unable tc\nremember a word he said. - Ed, )\nNETBALL\nFour matches played and four matches lost!\nThis sounds as if the Netball Team this year has\nnot the victorious possibilities of last year's team. An explanation is necessary not to vindicate\nbut at least to uphold the falling honour of the\nteam.\nThe crux of the matter lies in the fact that\nonly in the first practice match against The Hen\nwere we lucky enough to play our full team. This\nteam, be it said with all modesty, should be a match-winning one. There is plenty of enthusiasm\nand attack and a determination to get the ball at\nany cost. The initial weakness of poor shooting\nhas been lessened in the last two matches, both\nshooters being \"on form\" when playing Maria Grey\nTraining College. Criticism of that match would be\nunsure handling and catching of the ball and slowness in passing. Against Bedford it was anybody's game and it was just unfortunate that we did not\ncome out on top.\nThe practices with The Men are a great help.\n\u00ab request however from one member of the I.C. W.S.C. team has been made. Would The Men please cut their\nfinger nails before playing.\nEncouraging and fair support from spectators\nhas been much appreciated by both the visiting and\nthe home teams.\nHEN PARTY\nOn Tuesday, Oct. 17th, the first I. C.W. A. general meeting of the session was held. This was followed by the fresher s tea, to which all members of\nI. C.W. A. had been invited.\nThe general business of the meeting was accomplished with great dispatch. We would like to\ntake this opportunity to welcome Dr. Pratt as our\nnew Vice-President for this session. Apart from the\nodd hurried whispered consultation with the secretary, our President coped mo.st ably. She was not\neven noticeably disconcerted when an ominous clattering in the quad heralded the approach of the tea\ntrolley, laden with cups and cakes.\nThe male element of the community will probably be relieved to hear that no far-reaching or revolutionary decisions were made, though one fresh-woman has been heard to exclaim against the unfairness of the men only bar. Rest assured, she was im-e edi at ely, and we trust convincingly, talked round\nand I. C.W. A. remains content to be debarred. ( It's cheaper anyhow'.) One or two bright ideas were forth-coming, with the result that I. C.W. A. will, we hope,\nsoon be showing signs of life in directions other\nthan those strictly sporting.\nWith the handing round of the tea-cups a general babble of conversation broke forth and the next\nhour or so was pleasantly spent natt e ring to all and sundry on a great variety of subjects. Freshen,\nhaving shaken off the strangeness of the official\nFreshers' Day,occupied themselves with asking yet\nfurther questions about College Activities, and\neverybody came away knowing a few more people's na a ies. Altogether a successful occasion, and any of\nthe male inmates who were lucky enough to be in vit ad to coffee by a. hostel member of I. C.W. A. that\nevening, will be able to testify to the high quality of the cakes.\n(Note* For the unlettered, I. C.W. A. stands for I.C. Womens Association.)\nRUGGER\nThe i.e. Rugger Club have started t ne season,\n.'/ith a great determination to make a better show\nin the U.L. Cup this year than in the last two\nyears.\nThe Captain, Hawicz, has organised practices\non Monday evenings in Hyde Park which have been\nattended by i;.0 or 50 members of the Club, and the\ndiscussions on tactics which are held in the\nlunch hour on Fridays have led to valuable interchange of ideas on the finer points of the game.\nThe thought which has been given to the game\nhas been reflected in the matches and although\nthe Club cannot boast of any outstanding players,\nthe standard of rugby which is being played is\nlikely to lead to the greatest enjoyment and\nsatisfaction by those playing it. The wins a rain st the R.A.E. and. Rosslyn\nPark 'A' were particularly gratifying because\nof the high standard of team work and purpose\nthat was evident. Although the College ran up\na much bigger score against the Police at\nChigwell, there is perhaps, not surprisingly, o difference of ideas between the Police and the\nCollege ss to how the game should be played.'\nThe game against Borough Road College was\nvery satisfactory because besides depriving the\nCollege of an unbeaten record, it gave a lesson\nin the effectiveness of good handling, bustling\nforward play and successful use of the kick-ahead\nby the backs.\nImperial College had several very good three\nquarter movements which however usually failed\nbecause of a dropped pass which was then pounced\nupon by the opposition who, by kicking and ff tat following u u, quickly transferred the play into\nthe I.C.25. There are lots of lessons to be learned from\nthe Borough Road game and it is good that this\ngame came so early in the season so that the\nlessons which have been taught will be thoroughly\nlearned before the Cup matches come along.\nR.R.

However this had no bearing on\nhis next remarks concerning the close relation that then\nexisted between Guilds and the Royal School of Needlework\nor on the effect of some Guildsladies' steel corset bones\non Irof.Ayrton's galvanometers.\nOn reflection, Sir Bruce 'thought that the student\nspirit was less vigorous now than in his day j also, among\nengineers \"there were giants in those days\" who left a greater mark on their profession than was nowadays the\ncase. This was perhaps due to the age of expansion in\nwhich they lived. On the personal idiosyncrasies of\ngreat engineers Sir Bruce referred to Sir Frederick\nBramble, who detested smoking. The great man waa one\nday inspecting a sewer and one of his subordinates lita cigarette to counter the stench. Whereupon Sir Frederick\nroared \"What d 'you mean by lighting that smelly thing\ndown here?\"\nSpeaking particularly to Guildsmen Sir 3r uae said that\nan engineer was a man who could do for 2d. what any fool\ncould do for 6d \u00bb He found surprising the \"rising status\nof scientists\"; who lacked the necessary knowledge of\neconomics and the true value of industry characteristic of\na good engineer, \"Scientists\" said Sir Bruce, \"should be\nalways on tap but never on top.\" This led to sane restlessness among some sections of the audience - a feeling discreetly and gallantly concealed. Sir Bruce,urged his\nhearers to \"avoid safety first at all times\", to go abroad\nun trammelled by \"security of employment\" and to take \"as\nmany jobs as you can get while young\" so as to broaden\none's experience. He referred to his work on the Mulbery\nHarbours and remarked on the necessity of \"confidence in\nyour own ideas.\" In conclusion Sir Bruce remarked \"Do not\nblame me if you get the sack following my advice j\" The Rector then spoke spoke and after thanking Sir\nBruce bite for his speech and the advice therein, said\nthat he would be prepared to meet his challenge to the\npresent-day student spirit. He He would be prepared to\nbao k the efforts of present students against those of\nSir Bruce's day, \"in any sphere and in any space of time\ncoordinates,\" Sir Roderic concluded with some quotations\nfrom the writings of earlier professors of the College,\nThe trumpeters at the back of the Hall blew their\ntrumpets and the ceremony closed with \"the King\",\nNOVEMBER 4\nNO COMMENT From the Commemoration Day Conversazione programme:\n\" Z00L0GI Department where animal types used in teaching and\nresearch will be exhibited \"\nIt is now certain that the annual Guy Fawkes\nRag on the Albert Steps will not take place.

In these days of difficulty in getting into, and remaining at College,\nand the almost general reliance on Government\nGrants, this is a risk that few students would deliberately run, and so it seems that our traditional bonfire and high jinks on the steps of the Albert Memorial will not be held this year.\nBriefly the case for the police is that in resent years our November the 5th rag has ceased to\nbe a purely student affair; that a large crowd, in-eluding some of the wilder elements of the town,\nare attracted to it, and that it verges on a riot.\nWe dismiss as puerile their further argument that\ndamage may result from the bonfire lighted on the\npaved roadway by the steps. The fact is that by\nlighting a bonfire and throwing fire wo* ks in a public place we are breaking the law, and they have\ndecided that this lav; must be enforced.\nMany people contend, that this case is weak,\nand that this is merely another step in a general\ntrend towards the Police State, They point out that\nother Universities are experiencing the same trouble\nwith their Police Forces, and that last year the\nLondon Police even went so far as to prevent childrens' bonfires on bombed sites. Others say that\nthese things always happen every decade or so, and\nthat in a few years things will be back to normal -but this is of little consolation to us at present.\nMeanwhile various alternative plans are being\nsuggested, ranging from the ceremonial blowing up\nof the Chelsea Police Station, the Senate House and\nthe Home Office to the slightly more likely idea of\na purely domes tio celebration on the Rector's lawn,\nwhich Sir Roderic Hill has kindly made available.\nIn any case it seems that our commemoration of\nBritain's most unsuccessful saboteur will this\nyear be less riotous than of recent years.\nLABELS\nNot the least surprising of Sir Bruce White1\ns remarks\nXast week was his insistence on the labels \"scientist\" and\n\"engineer\" as if these two were of quite a different species.\nIs this not making a semantic mountain out of a molehill of\npedantry? Our respective curricula may differ but we are at\none in our scientific attitude to inquiry and experiment. It\nis surely impossible to draw the frontier between applied\nscience and engineering. The two fields overlap to such an\nextent that it may well be the physicist who designs a machine whilst the engineer concerns himself with the physics\nof its operation. Chemists may t sock and engineers may\nengineer but in the last analysis it comes to the same thing -we are all much of the 3a me persuasion and our different\nlabels are merely traditional relics. Engineers and scientists - we are so interdependent and intermixed that the label\nwe use is of little moment.\nEVERY THREE YEARS\nOnce every three years it is the custom of\nthe L.I. F.C.U. to hold a Mission in the University.\nPast Missions have been welcomed and appreciated by\nmany in this College, to some they have proved a real help. We take this opportunity of extending to\nyou a warm invitation to any or all of the services or meetings.\nWe believe that the message of the Mission\nwill be relevant to the times and worthy of the\nconsideration of every member of the College.

It is with the deepest regret that we have to\nannounce the death of Mr. J.C. Garland in the Mill\nHill air crash on 17th October.\nJohn Garland, who was 35, was a student in the\nMechanical Department of City and Guilds from 1932\n- 38, his prolonged period as an undergraduate\nbeing due to his interests in the wider aspects of\nCollege life being greater than in the purely ao a demi c work. He was at this time one of the most\nprominent members of the College, and his contact\nwith and interest in the College has never lapsed.\nOn leaving Guilds, he went into the Streamline Filter Co. and, when war broke out, entered\nthe K.A. F.,in which he was a Flight Lieutenant in the Technical Branoh. After the war he returned\nto his former firm and, at the time of his death,\nwas its Managing Direotor.\nEe was on the Old Centralians Committee and\nthis year became their representative on I.C. Council, in which capacity he was at the College\non the Thursday before his death. He wap -vi active and extremely popular member of the Links\nClub,- and seldom missed any of their dinners.\nHe is the son of Mr. C.S. Garland, one of the\nGovernors of Imperial College and a Member of the\nDelegacy of the City and Guilds College.\nHe leaves a wife and three children.\nHis funeral was held at Bromley on 2l3t October, and a wreath was sent by the Union on behalf\nof Imperial College.\nTRIP TO CAMBRIDGE FOR OVERSEAS STUDENTS\nOn Saturday 11th November there .will be a trip to Cambridge\nfor Overseas Students and any English students who are\nparticularly interested in forming friendships with Overseas\nStudents. Coaches will leave the I.C. Union gates at 10 a.m. on the 11th Nov and return in t he evening. Students will be\nconducted around Cambridge by Cambridge students and will be\nentertained to tea by them. Will those who wish to go on this1 trip please give their names to the seo ret ary in the Union\nOffice bef6 re Friday 3rd November and pay a booking fee of\n1/-, The total cost will be about 6/- plus booking fee.\nEDITORIAL NOTE\nOn reading through this page we find we have\na space here.\n\n"
