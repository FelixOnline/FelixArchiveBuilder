Articles on\nshops, trends, in fact anything to\ndo with style are welcome.\nThis week's article is on where\nto shop in London, for fresher s who aren't familiar with our capital\ncity and for older students who\nhaven't discovered all the great\nplaces yet. This isn'ta full guide\njust the places we know well and\nthink are worth a visit.\nOxford Street\nThe fashion mecca of London, if it\nisn't here you aren't gonna find it.\nWell that isn't strictly true, but as\nfar as high street shops are concerned they are all here usually in\nmultiples!\nPlaces worth visiting:\nTopshop/Topman: This shop is in\nOxford Circus right by the exits to\nthe tube station. It is absolutely\nhuge and you can quite easily get\ncompletely lost in it.\nTopshop is on the lower two\nfloors, with the widest range of\naccessories you have ever seen on\nthe ground floor. The basement\nhas all the clothes and will keep\nyou busy for hours!\nTopman is on the first floor and\nhas a good range of menswear. It\nis particularly good for going out\nclothes, though please not Ben\nSherman shirts!\nTips for this shop: Take your\nHigh Street Kensington - perfect for lunch time shopping\ntime! There is so much it is a good\nidea going with an idea of what\nyou want before you get there, just\nbrowsing will take hours.\nMango: For girls only this is a relatively new store. It's very good\nand very reasonable. Fantastic for\ncute little going out tops and up to\nthe minute fashion items.\nSelfridges: Well I couldn't mention\nOxford Street and not talk about\nthis store. It is up towards Marble\nArch and is normally full of\ntourists.\nIt has all the latest designer\nlabels and a few cel ebs walking\naround. The food department is\nalso fantastic and if you feel\ncheeky it is possible to get tasters\nof everything!\nHMV: There are a couple of these\nalong Oxford Street and have a great selection CDs and DVDs to\ntop up your collection.\nOxford Street takes time and\npatience with plenty of coffee\nbreaks. There are many coffee\nshops on side streets or my personal favourite is in Marks and\nSpencers, which always quiet and\nthey do a yummy hot chocolate!\nSaturdays are mad, never do\nOxford Street towards Christmas\nunless you are a rugby player\nbecause it is impossible. Also\navoid it in the rain because the\npavements turn into mini lakes\nand slow the flow of human traffic\ndown even more.\nShellys, Diesel, Urban Outfitters and Habitat on High St. Ken\nfashion.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

A free reply\nwith every e mail! Limited time only!\nxXx Starring:\nDirector:\nRunning Time:\nVin Diesel, Asia Agento,\nSamuel L. Jackson\nRob Cohen\n123 min\n\"A new breed of secret agent\" - indeed. Vin\nDiesel (Pitch Black, Fast and the Furious) is\ncertainly that and more. The man touted to\nbe the next Arnie stars in this high octane\naction-fest of a movie as extreme sports star\nand adrenaline junkie Xander Cage.\nRecruited by an American government in\nneed of \"something different\" in the on-going\nfight against Bond-esque villains, xXx sets\nout its stall as the first in what could prove\nto be a very popular franchise (xXx2 is pencilled in for a2004 release). For those who\nhave been stuck at the bottom of a well for a year, Vin (that's Mr Diesel to you) is a rippling mass of man-flesh with a voice Barry\nWhite would kill for. xXx sees him reunited\nwith Fast and the Furious director Rob Cohen\nin a movie not too dissimilar to the hugely\npopular Point Break with Fast Cars caper of\n2001. Huge stunts, staggering special\neffects and a brash, loud soundtrack are the\nname of the game with this one folks. With a large hunk of Cheddar on the side to adequately represent the script, plot and supporting cast.\nI broke all of my rules in watching this\nmovie. Well, I only really have one rule and\nthat is not to read any reviews before I see\nthe film. And I read them. I read them all.\nNow, whilst some of you may be thinking\nthis is no bad thing (research, background\nknowledge and the like) I have, over the last\nfew years, been thoroughly gutted on many\noccasions by the overly-detailed reports of\nreviewers who clearly have no intention of\nallowing their readers to enjoy a film. Pet\nhate of mine this, I despise knowing too\nmuch about a movie before I see it - it takes\nall the fun out of the experience. Seeing\nthese things cold is where it's at as far as I'm concerned (of course this raises the whole\nparadoxical/hypocritical issue of me writing\nreviews myself - I choose to ignore that one\nto save my meagre brain power for more useful tasks).\nWhy this long monologue you ask?\nWhere's the juicy details about xXx? Well,\nthe relevance of all this is that I have to\nadmit to being disappointed. My normally\nshield-of-steel like hype-defences let me\ndown and I was hoping for a lot more, so\nnaturally I was a touch put-out when the film\nfailed to deliver. I adore Vin Diesel so the\nman has to go some way to do wrong by me,\nbut then I am going to have unrealistically\nhigh expectations about a movie with such at anta lising premise as this one (better than\nBond etc). Vin isn't as awe-inspiring as he\nwas in Pitch Black, but he puts in a far more\nconvincing performance than he did in The\nFast and the Furious - in fact I would even go\nso far as to say Diesel carries this movie on\nhis huge shoulders. (By the way, two gold\nstars to anyone who can find me a coat like\nXander wears in this film - it's almost as cool\nas his modified GTO). So what's wrong with\nit? Well, there isn'ta plot for starters. Well,\nthere's something about an anarchy group\nbut it really could have been any generic\n\"Bad Person\" organisation. The script, whilst\nnot diabolical, is no masterpiece either and\nwill efficiently succeed in pissing off any biologist, chemist or engineer in the audience\nunless they can suspend their professional\ndisbelief for two hours. (Binoculars. Just wait\nuntil you see the binoculars.).\nThat said, it was never meant to be a cerebral film. If you can ignore the implausibilities of the plot and don't mind cheesy dialogue then you're off to a good start. The rest\nis just good-old honest action. Big bangs,\ngreat stunt work, with a touch of impressive\ncinematography thrown in. The greatest honour someone like me can bestow a movie is\nto say that I will definitely be getting it on\nDVD when it comes out. Is xXx deserving of\nthis accolade? I think it is. I want to see\nthose stunt sequences over again (maybe\nwith a bit of behind-the-scenes action too)\nand I 'll be needing to keep my Vin Diesel\nback-catalogue up-to-date.\nAll in all, a good (but not great) popcorn\nmovie. Si\nxXx was released on 18th October 2002,\nCert. 12 A.

    "content": "FELIX FASHION IC 9TU LE High Street Kensington\nThis is the closest shopping area to\ncollege and is a good place to nip\nalong in your lunch break. It isn't nearly as scary as it sounds with\nplenty of the high street chains.\nShops to visit-Urban Outfitters: Fantastic shop!\nJust the hippest shop you have\never been in. The ground floor has\nlots of kitsch stuff, useless but you\nstill want it. The clothes, both\nmale and female, are fabulous but\nexpensive, good in the sales\nthough. It also has a home department with the funkiest cocktail\nkits.\nDiesel: Worth a mention, but I think it is very over priced. Still I wouldn't mind a pair of Diesel\njeans.\nZara: Another undiscovered treasure by most women, much cheaper than it looks and with a very\ngood basics range.\nMiss Sixty: Expensive, but fantastic clothes for girls. Quite an intimidating store though.\nLush: I love this shop it is just\nheaven.\nThe smell drifts out of the shop\nand draws you in. For those of you\nwho haven't discovered it yet;\nLush is a shop that makes hand\nmade cosmetics.\nThis including bath bombs that\nyou drop in to a hot bath to fill it\nwith flowers or glitter or just to\nmake you smell fantastic. Massage\nbars for you and your significant\nother to enjoy and soaps piled to\nthe ceiling.\nGood for girls who want a treat\nand for boys who want to buy their\ngirls a treat, the staff are very helpful with out being too forceful or\noverbearing.\nAmazon: This is a group of shops\nhidden up Kensington Church\nStreet, mainly full of crap but there\nare hidden treasure like discounted\nFrench Connection stuff.\nH&M: Extremely cheap shop, full\nof fab bargains but it takes a bit of\nsearching to find them. There are\nactually two H& Ms within about\n100 meters of each other, one\nlarge and one smaller next to the\ntube station.\nA tip for this brand is to try\neverything on before you buy,\nmany things that look fantastic on\nthe clothes hanger look terrible on\na real person!\nKings road\nThe essential street for posing, a good place for car spotting\nbecause everyone brings their\nFerrari's and Porches here.\nThis street has a lot of small\nquirky little (expensive) shops,\nwith the extremely posh Sloane\nSquare at one end.\nMiss Sixty - fantastic jeans\nWithin the budget:\nBluebird: Okay not strictly in the\nbudget, this is the Conran food\nemporium. The food shop itself\nhas lots of possible presents and\nimports that you can't get anywhere else including Oreo cookies,\nyum!\nSpace NK: Fabulous cosmetics\nstore with brands like Stila and\nPhilosophy, expensive but the staff\nreally know the range so good if\nyou want something special or a gift for someone.\nSteinberg and Tolkein: A retro\nclothes fantasy, glamorous dresses\nand costume jewellery. Not cheap\nbut there is the odd bargain.\nLush: Again, but it really is fanta s tic.\nR soles: Again completely out of\nbudget but the best place to buy\nfantastic cowboy boots. I believe\nMadonna has a pair of these.\nReiss: A good men's clothing\nstore, not cheap but good for classic wardrobe staples. They have\nstarted doing a women's range as\nwell, though I am not sure if this\nstore is stocking it yet.\nPeter Jones: Right on the edge of\nSloane Square this is the ultimate\ndepartment store - it's huge! The\nstore isn't actually as scary as it\nfirst looks and the prices are very\nreasonable. The haberdashery section is amazing with lots of little\nsequins and feathers to customise\nclothes with.\nKnightsbridge\nMy tip is don't bother! Unless you\nwant to join the tourists to ga wp at\nHarrods or Harvey Nichols. There\nare a few of the high street stores\ndown here but I have no time for\nsnobby shop assistants who disapprove of trainers.\nCamden Market\nBloody marvellous place, just go\nand soak in the ambience! Go on a Saturday when all the markets are\non and take plenty of cash.\nCamden tube station is mostly\nexit only, so walk from here past all\nthe markets down to Chalk Farm\ntube station to get back.\nRokit: A very, very good vintage\nclothes store. Not the cheapest,\nbut definitely some good stuff.\nCold Steel: This is one of the\npiercing and tattoo places in\nCamden and if you're feeling brave\nenough to get your belly pierced\nthis is a good place to go. They\nlooked clean enough when I was\nthere anyway.\nThere is another, bigger vintage\nclothing store down in the Camden\nLock market whose name I can't remember.\nThere are lots of other random\nstores, the shoe shops are usually\npretty odd and very pricey.\nZara - Surprisingly cheap\nOh and if you buy a cheap\nwatch from one of the millions of\nmarket stores selling them don't expect it still to be working the\nnext day!\nPortobello Road\nStart off at Westbourne Park and\nwalk down to Ladbroke Grove or\nNotting Hill.\nThis market has everything,\nmainly tack though. A lot of\ndesigners have started off with\nstalls at this market so it can\nsometimes be worth a look. The\nantiques part of the market is usually packed so is to be avoided\nunless you are looking for some\ncostume jewellery. Gail\nPhotos by Matt\nCO CfL Tfl lL G coi op ou ff l fi The tastiest cocktail ever! The crushed ice is very important, if you\nhaven't got a proper ice crusher, try putting the ice in a strong plastic bag, wrapping it in a tea towel and bashing it on the floor or\nsomething.\nFor each drink you need the juice of one lime, 1 measure of Triple\nSec, 2 measures of Vodka and a top up of cranberry juice. Shake\ntogether with some ice cubes then serve over the crushed ice.\nObviously any umbrellas or citrus slices increase the classiness of\nthis drink.\nfashion.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX MUSIC REVIEWS Albums & Live Review\nRon Sexsmith\nCobblestone Runway\n4/5\nRon Sexsmith is a Canadian song-writer, who also got divorced just\nbefore starting the creation of his\nalbum. Maybe it's the contrary -the divorce led him to the album.\nAnyway it's quite easy that\nthere is a strong synergy between\nthat sad event in Ron's life and\nthat album. Basically, there is\nRon's guitar and Ron's voice, a warm, full one. And he's just saying something like \"Even if it's hard, keep going\". And as he did-n't commit suicide after his\ndivorce, he's kind of an anti-rock\nstar and that's even better.\nHis songs always use the same\ningredients but in a different way,\nsong after song, that you can't be\nbored if you liked the first one.\nHere some strings and a piano\nGold In Them Hills, here with a Lou Reed chorus These Days, a beachy funk a la Jamiroquai\nwhen he took his first 'l love-everybody' acid, and even, even\nsome gentle, discrete, useless but\ncharming electronic sounds.\nI must admit that rapidly, Ron\ncan be compared to a Pritchard or\nwin the title of Prince of\nSaccharose because of the sim-pli city, purity we could say, of his\nnotions of friendship and love.\nSomething like the two first commandments plus \"After all we're\nbest friends\". The title of his\nfourth song God Loves Everyone\ncould complete Ron's nice monk's suit.\nBut don't misunderstand, God\nLoves Everyone is an answer to\nthe murder of a gay student in\nWisconsin and to the people\nstanding outside with their signs\nsaying \"God hates fags\" or \"Burn\nin Hell fags\". Moreover, Ron\nmakes us feel good, it makes us\nquiet and confident for he really\nfound the means to reach our hidden and laughable desire for better things to come and for happier days. And if you haven't any of\nthis kind of longing, the release of\nRon's album proves you're right.\nNic\nVex Red & Biffy Clyro\nFriday 18th October, London Astoria\n5/5\nJudging by the crowd - huge\nmetal moshe s, fans crushed\nagainst the barrier, serious\ncrowd-surfing - I almost thought\nI'd missed out on the support\nband as I stepped into the\nAstoria. But no, all this was down\nto the latest craze among kid\nrockers: Biffy Clyro.\nWith the same talent for producing infectious riffs as emo-like\nRivals Schools and Jimmy Eat\nWorld, Biffy Clyro seem to have\nfound the right formula for damn\ngood rock-pop anthems.\nTonight they are on top form\nwith simple refrains and strong\nthree chord melodies that you\njust have to jump to. The four\nScots on stage must be loving it -the crowd are actually singing\nalong, they know the lyrics and\nwhat's more, they believe in\nthem with as much passion as\nBiffy Clyro sing them.\nThe lads know what they're\ndoing when it comes to playing\nlive. They're together, they're\ntight and they're firing out what\ncould be hit after hit. Their sound\nbuilds on itself and rises in\nrelentlessly inspiring phases; a teasing silence before the vocals\nkick in and carry the emotional\nwave back down.\nVex Red seem determined not\nto be outdone by their support\nact as they greet their metal\nmasses. For a band who have\ncome so far in such little time,\nthey step into the shoes of rock\nstars with professionalism, confidence and pride.\nWith no hesitation the band\nfires up their opening track - brilliant and exemplary riffs, rocking\nbass lines and electronica effects\nthat The Cooper Temple Clause\nwould be proud of.\nLead singer, Terry Abbott,\nreturns alone for the compulsory\nencore. \"We're just gonna have a little break,\" he reveals, and then\nquietly, ever so gently, he begins\nto play. Fans previously busy\nbeating the shit out of each other,\nstop and stare, mes meri sed by\nthe sweet vocals of Abbott,\nsomewhat reminiscent of\nSmashing Pumpkins' Billy\nCorgan. Half-way through this\nacoustic instant, three quarters of\nthe Astoria are crouching on the\nfloor, simply appreciating the surprisingly tender moment. In a very un-vex red-like manner, a few lighters are swaying slowly\nthrough the air. For a crowd that\nhave spent the entire night trying\nto injure themselves by throwing\nthemselves at anything or anyone\nin sight, the atmosphere really is\nquite moving.\nThere's such power and passion in this band and some-where, if you look a bit deeper, is\ntrue talent. Keira\nSingles\nThe Music - Getaway\nMore top-notch baggy psychedelia from the northern\nrockers that starts with an\ninsistent guitar melody, then\npiles on layers of electronic\ntwinklings and warbling s before launching into a blazing chorus of metal riffs. With\neveryone quoting influences\nfrom the Stone Roses to Led\nZeppelin (underlined by\nsinger Robert Harvey's vocal\nsimilarity to Robert Plant),\nit's all too easy to dismiss\nthem as purely derivative,\nbut the sheer breadth of\nexperimentation that goes\ninto their songs confirms The\nMusic's status as one of the\nmost exciting bands in the\ncountry right now. Both formats of the single are due to\nbe deleted on the day of\nrelease, so you'd better get a move on.\n5/5 Tom Bell\nEarth Terranova - Running\nAway\nI must confess my ignorance\nin not having heard the Bob\nMarley original, so I was\nunaware as to what to\nexpect. Thankfully, instead of\na like-for-like reggae cover\nlike The Fugees' No Women\nNo Cry, we get a trip-hop\nremake with a female vocal.\nSadly, that's where the innovations end, as the track\nmeanders along without providing anything that hasn't been heard a zillion times\nbefore. Much better is the\nNaughty remix, which treats\nthe track to a funk-inspired\nworkout, slowly building to a crescendo of vibrancy.\nWhilst the master probably\nwon't entirely endorse this,\nthere have been far worse\ncrimes against his name.\n3/5 Deepesh\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk Comments, emails and questions to the usual address\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FEATURES Q9 |\n\u00a7\ng$' Balls In Barbados\nhome with a toilet roll holder and\nthe surrounding piece of wall she\nhad taken it from.\nSaturday 29th June: After only\n2 hours sleep, the first memory of\nthe day is sleeping in the hotel car\npark. We had crawled out of bed\nwith probably the worst hangovers\nof the fortnight to get a taxi into\ntown, making our last effort for the\nBajan Unifest Tour - a Jolly Roger\nCruise. There was no drinking by\nus, even though it was free. There\nwas no snorkelling, even though it\nwas free. There was no moving.\nJess slept in the shade of the\nlower deck for the entire 4-hour\njourney, and lost a flip-flop over-board. Somehow it just didn't matter. Clare lost 2 t shirts over-board. Some made it onto the\nrope swing, some made it to\ndance on the deck.\nMost didn't. Sunday 30th June: The whole\nday was devoted to rest and recuperation. The IC Rugby team\narrived on Friday and this afternoon we went to watch their 1st game of the tour. They won, e as i ly. We followed a lazy day with a girls night in, with pizza and a film.\n2nd week: The days were spent\nplaying netball, cricket and\nrounders, followed by many great\nnights out with the IC rugby lads.\nDancing, drinking, sand fights,\nbeer fights, it could have almost\nbeen the union (I am, of course,\nlying). Whilst the St. Mary's girls\ntaught us new drinking songs, the\nboys taught us a few new drinking\ngames ('Fives' becoming a firm\nfavourite). A tropical storm kicked\nin on Tuesday and in true Brit\nfashion, we headed to the beach\nto play rounders. In a last minute\npanic about lack of cultural knowledge of Barbados, we went to\nBridgetown, the island's capital.\nIn a cultural overdose, we invested in matching Hawaiian shirts,\nso we would look really classy\nwhen we went out. We also went\non a coach tour of the island.\nBarbados is 11 by 14 miles (I know lots of interesting facts like\nthis now), so getting anywhere is\nvery quick. We saw Harrison's Cave, the 8th wonder of the world\naccording to our guide. To be hon-est, it could have been Devon. We\nalso went to the Flower Forest, a plantation, and got very excited\nabout seeing real monkeys. The\nwalk took us only 30 minutes as\nthe lure of a cafe at the end of it\nwas too great. The IC Netball and\nRugby squads invaded Sherry's home on Friday afternoon for a fantastic barbecue. We played a friendly netball match against the\nCheltenham and Gloucester\n(hockey) team - we won - with the\nrugby team as our back-up. The\nend of tour meal was our last\nchance to dress up and wear the\nheels we had packed but not worn\nfor 2 weeks. Awards were won,\nwine was drunk. Harbour Lights,\nstilt-men, rugby boys and rum\npunch beckoned.\n\"I'm really glad I joined the netball club,\" said Ragga Queen\nClare during a night at Harbour\nLights. That's what it's all about.\nRuth Roberts\nWho Hosts, Wins\nIt is hard to see why the appropriate entities are not pushing harder\nto make Great Britain a true contender for future Olympic bids. For,\nthroughout this great summer of\nsport, one theme has consistently\nsurfaced. Almost without exception,\nthe host nation has performed\nabove all expectations. This holds\ntrue across a wide range of sports\nand from the very beginning of the\nsummer at the World Cup right\nthrough to last September's delights at the Belfry. There is no\nquestion that a nation performing\nwell is a happy nation, both economically and socially, and the way\nto ensure success seems to be to\nengineer the presence of a fervent\nhome support.\nCurtis Strange said it himself in\nthe build-up to the 34th Ryder Cup\n- \"I expect Sam (Torrance) to enlist\nthe help of a thirteenth man - the\ncrowd.\" Said supporters did themselves proud, buoying the European\nplayers along on a tide of emotion,\npassion and desire. However, they\ndid not forget that they were a golfing crowd, and generously applauded the American players as well.\nThus, the event was the friendliest\nfor some years, but there was no\ndoubting that the Europeans would\ndig that little bit deeper, such was\nthe abundance of flags of every\nEuropean nation involved. There\nwere even some sightings of the EU\nflag, indicating a newfound togetherness that could only benefit the\nteam. We all know the end result:\nColin charged from the front, the\nleader board began to turn a lovely\nshade of blue, Paul McGinley tidied\nthings up, Sam cried and Sunday\nlunches were punctuated with cries\nof joy.\nTurn the clock back a couple of\nmonths and we find ourselves in\nManchester, in the midst of\nEngland's most successful\nCommonwealth Games ever. The\nother Home Nations performed well\nbut it was England who shone,\nalmost as brightly as David\nBeckham's glorified shell suit at the\nopening ceremony. Never before\nhad three flags of St George flown\nhigh in the swimming pool, but in\nManchester it happened twice in\nthe same evening. Even more\nunheard of, as swimming took centre stage, the Australian women's relay team was beaten by the girls\nfrom England. Twice. On the running track, Paula Radcliffe's second\nstep towards the completion of an\nastonishing hat trick (London\nMarathon, Commonwealth\n5,000m, and European 10,000m) was typical of the spirit of the\nEnglish team throughout the\nGames. Through the pouring rain,\nthis skinny lass with knee socks\nwas cheered from start to finish as\nshe demolished the opposition. The\nwomen's hockey team surpassed all\nexpectations by reaching the final,\nonly losing to India at the very\ndeath. All over Manchester, athletes\nyoung and old were inspired by the\nenthusiastic crowd. All over the\nnation, viewers were inspired by the\nenthusiastic athletes. A report has\njust been issued stating that the\nGames were a success financially. It\nwas sport at its best, prosperous\nfrom all angles.\nBack at the beginning of the\nsummer the football f unfair that is\nthe World Cup visited Asia for the\nfirst time. It was also the first time\nthat two countries had shared the\nhonour of hosting the tournament.\nYet again, both host nations easily\ntranscended even the most optimistic hopes. Who can forget the\nexcitement generated by Inamoto,\nthen an unknown Japanese in the\nHighbury shadows, currently starring for Fulham. Then there was\nSouth Korea, who no-body, but nobody could have expected to reach\nthe dizzying heights of the semi-finals. The level of support for this\ncountry was verging on the alarming and the nation must have added\na packet to its GDP through replica\nshirt sales alone. With this sort of\ncrowd co-ordination, this was one\nplace where one could almost\nexpect a testing of the theory that, if\nall the crowd exhaled together, they\ncould blow the ball into the appropriate net. With the parties going on\nlong into the night and the legacy of\na dozen stadiums of superb quality,\nnot many would question the benefits of hosting this competition.\nYet still the politicians faff around\nwith no plans in the near future to\nbring any of the world's major\nsporting events to Great Britain. Not\nthe Olympic Games, not the World\nAthletics Championships, not the\nWorld Cup. With even a national\nstadium beyond our capabilities,\nthere seems little hope that this will\nchange in the near future. We cannot underestimate what we are\nmissing out on.\nSarah Nicholson\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "INTERNATIONAL World Soc FELIX A fun and energetic evening was had by all at\nthe Diwali evening on Tuesday. On entering\nguests were presented with ami thai sweet and\nan offer of a tikka mark for their forehead. By\n20:30, some of the Thali dances had already\nbegun, with concentric lines circling the central\ntable where dancer figurines surrounded a flower-bedecked Krishna. We soon approached\nthe 400 mark, as students from Kings, LSE,\nUCL City and QMUC joined their IC counterparts in the biggest student Diwali in London.\nThe lines swelled as people took off their shoes\nand succumbed to the beat of the drums, which\nwere backing the singers and synthesizer of the\nNishaan Band. They tirelessly played throughout the evening, their music a fusion of Indian\nwith references to Western influences, such as\nthe Titanic theme.\nAs the music quickened, it became clear that\nthe majority, in traditional dress, were going to\nmaintain their elegance much longer than those\nin western garb, the cooler outfits being much\nbetter suited for the energetic dances; a continuous swirl of gold-edged beige s, blues, pinks,\npurples yellows and greens.\nA quick break for some speeches from NHSF,\nand a glance to see who was here. Not just students from Britain, and a few from India, but\nalso people from communities in Kenya,\nDiwali\nThe presentation of a big cheque\nMauritius and Malaysia, and not just Hindi students but Muslim too, reflecting the fact that\nDiwali is not merely a religious festival, but a community one too.\nEveryone now congregated for the Aarti\n(prayer), led by the band. \"Diwali\" comes from\na corruption of the Sanskrit \"Deepa Avali\", literally \"light formation\". It is the Hindu New Year,\na celebration of purity. Deepavali is placed at\nthe center of the 5 day festivities, and is the last\nyear of the lunar calendar cycle. The other days\ncelebrate aspects such as love of one's kin, the\ntriumph of good over evil, the killing of the ego\nand removal of ignorance. If you're a businessman you also worship Lakshmi, the goddess of\nwealth.\nA cheque was presented to NGO Sewa\nInternational, who have projects rebuilding\nschools in earthquake-devastated Gujarat. This\nwas followed by dancing - the line dances of\nRumjanuu or Rail Gadi, which imitate the shaking of a railway carriage! Then a masterful presentation dance to music from Devdas, which\neasily overcame a false start, follow d by everyone joining in the Gujarati dance Raas. Long\nparallel lines form, with opposite partners tapping their dandi ya batons, twirling, tapping and\nmoving on to the next partner in line. All this\nhappens quickly, to the frenetic sound of\nNishaan pushing the sound to extremes of\ntempo and volume. The stamina was imp res sive, frequently the dancers lasted longer than\ntheir dandi yas, which weren't up to all that tap-ping! A brief pause to pick out winning dancers,\nbefore the evening continued with Bhangra as\nyour reviewer unwillingly left. Many thanks to\nKeshava Shastry, and all others who helped\nremove the more glaring errors... Ed\nFocus on:\nFed up with no-one here knowing\nthe first thing about your country?\nDo half the people you meet consider the Mappa Mundi as hot car-to graph y? Well, here's your chance\nto rectify the situation. We want\ncontributors for Focus on:, and not\njust from countries represented by\nthe OSCs here at Imperial.\nBecause we know you're out\nthere...\nAccording to last year's annual\nreport , the top ten foreign nationalities are (approx.) as follows:\n425 Greeks, 325 Malaysians,\n225 French, 225 Singaporeans,\n190 Germans, 125 Italians, 110\nChinese, 90 Indians, 80 Thai and\n70 Nigerians. (Compare with\n6585 Brits). Now there were\n9975 of us in total, so there must\nbe several other nationalities out\nthere. We know of Columbians,\nKenyans and Russians, but perhaps there are also Djiboutians,\nNepalis and Azerbaijanis. We\nwant to hear from all nationalities!\nSo write us an article about your\ncountry, and when we've got\nenough, we'll run it. We're not a beard-stroking political forum, so\nby all means include a bit about\nthe history (post-colonialism per-mitte d) and such matters, but\nkeep it succinct.\nSections we'd really enjoy would\nbe like some of the following\nideas:\nSlang from your country -include the meaning, and possibly\nan idea of how acceptable it is,\nunless you're of a particularly mischievous bent.\nThe local sport (other than foot-ball) - we know there are plenty\nout there, for example petanque,\ntak raw and sch winger. However,\ndo include the stranger ones - the\nconker equivalents.\nWhat tourists might think\nthey're saying, but due to mispronunciation/ just being wrong they\nare in fact saying... An example of\nthis is the word 'embarrassed',\nusually translated into Spanish by\nus Brits as 'em baras a do'. In fact it\nmeans pregnant, which aptly\ndescribes the ensuing silence,\nespecially if you're a guy.\nSocial stuff - what you and your\nfriends get up to, places to go out\nin your city, local drinks (alcoholic\nor other), the local equivalent of\ncheesy pop, and please, the alter-natives!\nIn brief, famous people from\nyour country, any interesting web-sites, ways to visit cheaply if you're\na student and customs that\ntourists always get wrong.\nDon't restrict yourself to the\nabove, do let us know if you want\nto be anonymous and get writing!\nSo, you're an international student in Britain. No doubt you're\nalready familiar with many of\nthis country's quirks, but there\nare certainly aspects which will\nhave escaped you. For a start,\nyou're in London, which is not\nrepresentative.\nFor example, when did you\nlast see a restaurant dedicated to\nBritish food? Some students\n(often French) may go out of\ntheir way to avoid such a thing,\nbut I know you'll all be open-minded (or risk having your\nGallic cheek slapped), and try to\nfind out more about this country.\nI 'll be your guide to the intricacies of Britain and Britons,\nexamining diverse topics - places\nyou'll never visit, stereotypes,\nslang, food - you get the idea.\nFor today, you'll have to content\nyourself with dispelling a myth:\nthe stiff upper lip we're supposed to sport in adversity.\nYou're only likely to come across\nthis outside a botox clinic.\nCholmondely\nworld.felix@ic.ac.uk Want to review for us?

    "content": "SPORT FELIX eight goal thriller\nIC VI 4 - 4 IC V It should first be noted that this\nis by far and away the most\nimportant fixture of the season\nfor both teams, and there was\npride as well as points at stake.\nThe sixths had won all their\nprevious games and had beaten\nthe fifths in their last encounter\nstarted the match as favourites.\nBut this was a fierce local derby,\nand both teams knew that the\nform book could be thrown out\nthe window.\nThe sixths took the lead\nthrough Richard Jones after a particularly scrappy opening\nperiod, even by our standards,\nbefore John Scott levelled following a corner.\nThe game became more\nstretched as both sides began to\nbelieve it would be much better\nto win, rather than simply to not\nlose. The fluidity and pace of the\nsixth's play was truly superb, as\nSugi and Rich combined magnificently to set Luis up, who coolly rounded the keeper to give the\nsixths a well deserved lead. The\nnext twist in the tail came just\non the very stroke of half time,\nwhen in the absence of a linesman the fifths equalise d. The game was already particularly heated, and this incident\nreally threatened to push it\ntowards a melt down of truly\nepic proportions.\nThe second half began at a frenetic pace, which suited each\nteams wide players, and gave\nboth sets of full backs plenty of\nwork to do.\nThis pressure finally told when\nRich was violently pushed in the\nback following a long throw and\na penalty was rightly awarded.\nYusef, the fifths left back then\nthrew a spectacular diva-esque\ntantrum, but Sugi kept his nerve\nto coolly slot away the penalty.\nThe fifths then equalise d again through Dave Yates after\nsloppy defending - that was\nentirely my fault - following a Caruso toe-punt, I mean free\nkick. We then withstood some\nconcerted pressure but Pete was\nnever really tested following a succession of long range efforts.\nThe pace of Sugi always gave us\nan outlet up front and eventually\nhe latched onto a long pass only\nto be body-checked by the fifth's keeper who still continues to\nprotest his innocence despite\nsending Sugi six foot up into the\nair. A penalty was, once again,\nduly awarded, and Sugi eventually picked himself up and dusted himself down to despatch his\nsecond goal of the game.\nAt 4-3 we believed the game\nwas ours following a superb\nsave by Pete to deny Gucci. But\nin the last minute of the game\nafter a number of set pieces the\nfifths managed to equalise following a goal mouth scramble.\nTo this day no one knows\nquite how Gaetan managed to\nscore as he was trying to clear\nthe ball from his own area, but\none thing is for sure; neither\nteam will forget the match in a very, very long time.\nA Plea From the Editor\nCan all teams either drop their\nresults into the Felix office or\nsend them - even if you can't be\nbothered to write a report - to\nsport.felix@ic.ac.uk as soon\nafter the event as they can?

As\nthe promoters say themselves, the music is\neclectic - although they hate to admit it, it\nranges from Glam Rock to Indie and then in\nsome way to Punk. As bizarre as that sounds,\nit actually works.\nThe venue itself has two rooms, the main\ndance floor and a smaller chill out area with\ncomfy couches and the all-important bar. The\nclub itself is welcoming to students and easy to\nlocate, but the atmosphere at Trash nights can\nbe a little pretentious with a typical clientele of\nart students and young rich kids; although the\ndress code is non-specific you will get turned\naway if your sense of fashion doesn't fit. This\nis where the aforementioned club kids get a bit\nsnobby. Alternative is the buzzword and you\nhave to be a little different in your image to be\naccepted. Basically avoid straight leg jeans\nand check shirts, dig out old Adidas pumps\nand the hideous tank top your granny knitted.\nAll that aside it is an interesting night and\nworth going if you get kicks out of laughing at\nothers.

The passion of the music and the\nartists soon take over and as part of the crowd\nyou suddenly feel part of the show. Balloons\nand confetti fall from above while shimmering\ndancers in remarkable feather headdresses\nshow the star-struck masses how it's done.\nThe flavour of Paraiso hits you straight in the\nheart and goes right to the head.\nAnd if you're worried about how your personal samba skills (or lack of) will size up on\nthe dance floor, then have no fear. There are\nfree beginners dance classes courtesy of\nParaiso, and so you'll be up on the podium in\nno time at all\nParaiso is a night to stimulate the senses;\nwith enough feathers, colour, laughter and\nmusic to satisfy every desire and leave you\nbegging for more.

    "content": "SPORT FELIX virgins spanked IC Virgins 5 - 1 7 Kingston\nHey kids, to keep a promise I made to the faithful massive, I would like to point out that this\nweek, Steve is boy of the week.\nTwo of our resident slap per s are\non top form, and as I speak\nDappy 'the bigger tits the better'\nWilliams is being serenaded by\nthe entire thirds team. Yeah baby,\nyou love it, you slag.\nSo, to dedicate more than our\nusual one sentence to the match\nthis week, a poor start put us\nbehind in the opening minutes.\nWith tackling still a problem -strange considering we so used to\ngoing down - and was our main\nweakness. Two of their tries were\na result of continued forward\npressure, the first from a scrum\nand the second from a line out. It\nwas at about this point that\nGemma had a distinct feeling of\ndeja vu when her opposite number seemed to be the blok e she\nshagged last Saturday. Each of\ntheir forwards had about a twenty stone weight advantage - big\nbiff as they were - so scrum mag ing was certainly a challenge.\nTheir number one was so large\nthat she had to wear a different\nshirt from the rest of them - eek.\nThe third try was from their fit -take that as you wish - full back,\nwho managed to sidestep the\nentire team and score - take that\ntoo, as you wish - under the\nposts.\nMost important of all, we must\ncome to our glorious try. ICU\nbaby, shaking that arse, shaking\nthat arse. So Gemma, who\nshagged Steve, ran at high speed\ninto their stunned scrum half\nwho'd actually caught the ball off\ntheir line out, caught the loose\nball and put it down over the line.\nOh the glory. We did nearly score\nsports shorts\nIC II 3 - 0 Kingston II\nImperial's seconds once again\ndefeated their opposition to continue in their unbeaten season so\nfar. Despite only having 10 players\non the pitch we managed an\nimpressive victory. After finding a keen volunteer to be goalie in\nKatherine she was the rock of our\nalready solid team.\nAnna, Alice and Clare made\nimpressive runs up the wings, and\nset up excellent goals for calm and\ncollected Marianne to drive in and\ntake the glory. The midfield did\ntheir job well, with Ysanne and\nDaisy providing excellent shots up\nto the front.\nOn our final short corner Anna's spectacular dive gave us a penalty\nflick, which was neatly put away\nby Brenda.\nThe defenders Nat and Jenny\nquietly put paid to all of the opposition's attempts at goal.\nAll in all it was an excellent\nmatch, and the seconds are on\ntrack for their best season on\nrecord.\nIC I52 Chichester I There really is nothing to say\nabout the game, except that a truly legendary victory was\nrecorded by the IC Mens hockey\nfirsts against a bunch of jumped\nup, pompous little bastards from\nChichester.\nIC III v St Mary's St Marys were looking absent\nfrom the kickoff. Their back line\nwas turned to vapour under\nJames Walker's fiery onslaught,\nand total annihilation and proof\nthat St Mary's couldn't punch\ntheir way out of a paper bag soon\nfollowed, leaving us with a fifty\npoint walk over. Long live Silvia\nand bring on the medics!\nanother try but I wasn't on the\npitch at the time, which obviously made all the difference.\nSeriously, after a series of penal-ties, we ended up camped on\ntheir line and after Ling-a ding\nand Danielle Spatchcock chicken\ntried to take it blind we lost the\nball, and it was blasted into\ntouch.\nThe second half of the match\nwas definitely our favourite bit.\nWe played well, our tackling\nimproved, along with our ruc king, mauling and general handling\nskills. It did help that they were\nyet another team of moaning\nbitches who got so arse y and\npissed of that they gave away\nnumerous penalties that we,\nunfortunately, couldn't take\nadvantage of. The comedy bitching of their backs did provide\nsome quality entertainment\nthough, albeit from 20 yards\naway.\nOther highlights include Becky's flooring of their Steve\nDoppelganger number eight,\nDorkwell actually catching the\nball, Priyah's kicking and tackling,\nand Filthy's quality swimming hat\n- there to protect her hundred quid\nweave from the pounding rain\ntype evil weather.\nMan of the match had to be\nSnotty-Posh who managed to run\ndiagonally - but not flat - all over\nthe pitch, and coped with the\nadverse conditions stunningly. Fair\nplay, she downed the pint event u ally, but the gagging was just not\nattractive. Love you Snots!\nSo to conclude, the match was\na very encouraging sign of great\nthings to come from the team: we\nare well on our way to winning\nvarious cups, leagues and\nmen/women.\nA joke to finish: what's green\nand smells of pig? Kermit's fin-gers.\nSpend the Next Summer in\nthe USA\nUndergraduate\nResearch\nOpportunities\nProgramme\n\u2022 University of Delaware placements available\n\u2022 Presentation on Tuesday 5 November at 13:10 in Room\n342, Mechanical Engineering\n\u2022 Information and application forms available at the\npresentation and thereafter from Room 324, Level 3\nSherfield Building\n\u2022 Applications must be handed in at Room 324 Sherfield\nBuilding by 12:00 on Friday 15th November 2002\nMore information about this opportunity and about\nURO P in general at www.uro p. ic.ac.uk\nand about University of Delaware at www.u del. edu/UR\nsport.felix@ic.ac.uk Won?

Advertised as having 'the latest hot stuff'\nthis is a website with a serious number of cool\ngadgets. I could so easily blow my entire loan\non this site, it has an amazing selection and is\neasy to browse with loads of information,\nincluding pictures, on each item. I cannot\nemphasise enough how fantastically easy it is\nto navigate around this site, with a short\nabstract to catch your attention then loads\nmore stuff about it including reviews from people who have bought it. There is a little green\ntick if it is currently in stock for you to order\nand if not then there is the option to pre-order.\nOne of my friends (yes I have some) has just\nhad a twenty first birthday and I got him an\nacre of land on the moon. However, do be\nwarned that this led to a good many awful\njokes about being given the moon. Somehow I don't think it was the first or last time that joke\nwill be made.\nThe most amazing section is the expensive\nstuff, you can purchase a sky car( yes, one that\nflies), with a vertical take off and a top speed\nof 380mph. At only \u00a3324,000, it's a bargain.\nIf anyone has exams coming up or coursework due in, sorry, this is a great site for procrastinating even if you are broke (and being in\ncentral London as a student this is quite likely).\nThere really is something for everyone here so\ngo, procrastinate and enjoy.\nOh, and if anyone feels like it, they can buy\nme the blink digital camera - me want!\nwww.firebox.cam\n\" Freethinkers welcome\" Now for a more serious way to waste time.\nEverybody knows the Guardian newspaper\nwhether you read it or not, knowing this it is\nnot difficult to realise that there will be a web\nsite. However, I am not interested in the news\naspect of this web page because we all know\nthat it is there and in hundreds of other places\non the net. The reason I draw your attention to\nthis is the talk boards, discussions on everything and anything.\nI love a good debate, and this place provides\nthe opportunity to air opinions and then have\nthem questioned by other (hopefully intelligent)\npeople. This is a really popular site so the discussions move on fairly speedily if it is something people want to talk about, a discussion\non where you left your inflatable pigeon might\nnot last very long. There are some very serious\ndiscussions and it is really good to hear what\nother people think about the important issues.\nThere are also threads that will interest those\nof you looking for a little light entertainment\nsuch as \"why are the Americans not told about\nthe outside world?\" or \"men get angry, women\nget depressed\".\nWhile this site can be read without logging\non, it is necessary to register in order to leave\nyour own comments or start your own thread.\nThis is a simple process that even the slowest\nof you ought to be able to manage.\nThere aren't too many restrictions on the\ncontent and language - trust me I had to work\nhard to get thrown off this site. I suppose this\nT.,l \u201e \" U,. \u201e\u00ab\u201e.\u201el.., Tfrli^r*il niv n*iM MI W BB\nA little present for those of you who like a good argument\nis because the Guardian advertises \"free\nthinkers welcome\".\n'The haven' contains some of the more light\nhearted threads, while others such as 'issues',\n'science' and 'UK news' include important dis-cuss ions. Despite the anonymity of this site, or\nmaybe because of, there is quite a lot of personal banter which is fun and often insulting.\nMaybe it would be worth starting a thread on\nwhether the merger with UCL is going to be a step forward or a step back, might be interesting to see what our future employers think. Or\nour other favourite topic of conversation, top-up fees. Well, whatever you wish to discuss,\nwhether sober or not, in my opinion this is the\nbest web site to visit.\ntalk.guardia o. co.uk\nTerm of the Week: Firewall\nI know I'm not the only one who hits these\nand wonders what they are, well, they are the\nfirst line of defence to protect a system from\nunauthorised users. They prevent access to or\nfrom private networks, i.e. the internet users\nfrom accessing private networks (intranet s) without authorisation. Messages have to pass\nthrough the firewall and meet certain security\ncriteria before you are allowed access.\nThere are four types of firewall: packet fil-ter, application gateway, circuit-level gateway,\nand proxy server. Usually a combination of\nthese techniques are used in order to give the\nbest security. So there.\nFrom the dot Meister I did my best this week to find something\ninteresting about bonfire night and fireworks\nbut it was all a bit poor. It seems that the internet thinks bonfire night is solely for children,\nwell I beg to differ on that point, I love burning things.\nAnyway, as a consequence of my fruitless\nsearch you are lumbered with two totally unrelated sites. Firstly, there is firebox, a brilliant\nsite and a friendly, excellent service in my\nexperience. Secondly, the talk board that the\nGuardian newspaper provides for those of us\nwho enjoy discussing the issues of the day.\nHave a good bonfire night and don't let your\npets out. Jenny\nweb.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

No, my advice is\njust to put off whatever you can for\nas long as possible. And keep a large pan of water always on the\nboil.

That's at least six hours\nbefore a man should naturally\nwake, and the results can clearly\nbe seen in lectures.\nAt school, you were told off for\nfalling asleep in a lesson, and could\nexpect to be on the receiving end of\na well-aimed board rubber if you\ndozed off. But at university, you're\nsupposed to be mature enough to\nmaintain consciousness throughout\nyour education. Just like you're\nsupposed to be organised enough\nto get those problem sheets done\nwithout anybody having to check\nup on you. Carte blanche to do\nbugger all really. As students take\nadvantage of their \"resp on sibi li ties\", whole lecture theatres begin\nto resemble dormitories, or perhaps\nthe scene of a carbon monoxide\nleak, with students unconscious on\nA4 pads and a man at the front\nshouting mad gibberish.\nYou know when you're falling\nasleep and you get random sentences coming into your head?\nWell, maybe it's just me, but if it's9am and you're trying to write lecture notes, you have to be careful\nnot to let the brain noise get in the\nway of what you're supposed to be\nstudying. If you're not careful, you\ncan end up writing notes like \"In\ntime t, if an energy E is transferred\nto the man standing on the brick\ngoalpost with his battered, gelatinous hand clenched around a whale's kidney, the conjecture is\ntrue for all k.\" That's not much help\ncome revision time - you can't write\nthat in an exam. Perhaps I should\nhave done a Philosophy degree.\nThen maybe nobody would notice.\nAlex\nProcrastinate\nSummer In the US, Anyone?\nA Presentation promoting next\nyear's exchange will be held on\nTuesday 5 November in Room\n342, Mechanical Engineering\nBuilding at 1:10 (until 2pm lat-est). Application forms will be\navailable on the day. Further information available on the UROP\nweb-site at\nwww.uro p. ic.ac.uk/opp s. html\nThe UROP (Undergraduate\nResearch Opportunities) program\nprovides many research opportunities within the college for undergraduates to have the chance to\nexperience an academic research\nenvironment. Unknown to many,\nUROP also has a partnership with\nthe University of Delaware (UDel),\nsituated on the East Coast of USA\n(about 2 hours or less from New\nYork and Washington D.C.) for an\nexchange program where a group\nof IC students swap places with\nUDel students during the summer\n(8-9 weeks) for research work. The\nidea is to exchange knowledge and\ncultural experience, widen your\nperspective, make a whole load of\nnew friends and have lots of fun.\nUDel is situated in Delaware,\nwhich houses the Delaware\nMemorial Bridge (world's largest\ntwin span bridge) and is known as\nthe First State since it was the first\nto ratify the US Constitution in\n1787. Among other things, UDel\nis well known for having a good\nundergraduate research program\nin the US. It is also affiliated with\nnames such as DuPont and Gore.\nUDel is a campus university, quite\nunlike our dear Imperial College,\nwith beautiful buildings nicely\nlocated within a planned land-scape. It is in the town of Newark,\na university town where it's Main\nStreet (High Street equivalent) is\nlocated about 3 minutes away.\nThat's3 minutes away from good\nand cheap food. If there is need,\nyou will be supplied with a bicycle\nfor you to bike around UDel and its\nsurrounding rural area.\nFor the keen sportsman/sports-women, being a campus universi-ty, UDel provides many free facilities for our use such as indoor and\noutdoor swimming pool, gym, rock\nclimbing room, athletic field and\nothers. We were located in an air-conditioned accommodation with\ntennis court, basketball court,\nroller-hockey rink and football field\nwithin the perimeter. There is also\na nearby green lawn where we frequently play Ultimate Frisbee,\nWhopper Ball or other interestingly named games. American students are sport enthusiasts so\nthere is good chance of you getting\ninvited for a game everyday.\nFor the traveller in you, there will\nbe no complaints. Every weekend,\ntrips are organised for the Summer\nScholars (that's us and other\nAmerican students) to cities nearby\nsuch as Philadelphia, New York,\nWashington D.C and Baltimore.\nThere are also trips to the beach,\nsoaking in all that hot American\nsun or the mall (shopping for the\npoor girls) or hiking in the nearby\nforest reserve. If you are lucky, you\nmight even be invited to go on a road trip in the oldest car you have\never known to be alive (3 years\nyounger than you), which was consequently donated to charity after\nfour days of the trip. Only if you are\nlucky, I must say.\nThe research work itself varies\ndue to which projects you are\nundertaking. Basically, you will\neither have your own separate\nproject within a research group or\nwork closely in a research team for\ncertain objectives. There are many\ninteresting research projects, some\ninclude visiting bridges around the\narea (up to Brooklyn Bridge in New\nYork), and others offer usage of\ninteresting equipment such as\nelectron microscope to photograph\ncrystalline structure. The project's success depends on you and your\ninitiative and you will be given full\nsupport by your supervisors (some\ninclude picnics and dinners).\nNear the end of your stay, you\nwill be placed in a home stay for\ntwo weeks. This means that you\nwill be living with American families and experience a taste of the\nAmerican way of life. This might\ninclude baseball games, sailing\nboats, exchange of culinary\ndelights between your country and\nUSA, political discussions, huge\nshopping malls, craft-making,\nkayaking and much more (Fuhh..\nthat's a lot).\nAll in all, it was one of the best\nexperience all five of us had and\nwe recommend it to all of you.\nAini Haryati Mohd Saleh,\nDhruv Pandya, Lindi Tan,\nJulia Krohn, Helen Clubb.\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "UCL Referendum\nA referendum of Imperial College students will\nbe held on 25th and 26th November over the\nrecently announced plans to merge with\nUniversity College, London.\nThe referendum was officially approved at an\nEmergency Council Meeting - the second this\nterm - last Monday, but the details have since\nbeen set by the Union's Executive, a much\nsmaller committee which oversees the general\nrunning of the Union.\nThe IC/UCL ballot comes just a few months\nafter Imperial students voted on Imperial\nCollege Union's affiliation with the National\nUnion of Students (NUS). That referendum had\nthe biggest turn-out of any student ballot at\nImperial for several years, but many are already\nvoicing concerns that the question of merger\nmay fail to capture the student body's attention.\nCampaigning for both sides officially begins\nnext week and will continue until the referendum itself which is due to be held in three\nweeks' time.\nArtist's impression of the referendum\nAs it stands, there are already several people\ninterested in leading the merger \"Yes\" campaign\nbut few are willing to lead the \"No\" band. This\nis surprising given recent remarks about the\nproposed merger (see letters, page 13). Past\nexperience has demonstrated that a good\nturnout, and hence a meaningful result, often\ncomes with outspoken and vigorous campaigning by both sides.\nUnion Break-In\nSignificant damage was caused last\nweekend when a thief ransacked the\nUnion offices in Beit Quadrangle.\nThe burglar took the float for the\ntill at the front desk, as well as charity collection tins. The haul is probably worth little over \u00a350. However,\nin an effort to find more cash, filing\ncabinets and drawers were severely\ndamaged, mostly with implements\nfound in staff offices, several of\nwhich were also searched.\nThe burglary was discovered on\nSaturday afternoon by one of the\nDeputy Presidents. College Security\nwas notified and the police arrived\nshortly afterwards.\nKen Weir, Head of Security, said\nthat the situation was \"a police\ninvestigation\", but indicated CCTV\nfootage was unlikely to help apprehend the burglar. Instead, it is hoped\nfingerprints gathered at the scene\nmay provide important links.\nForced entry around College is\napparently a small problem compared with \"walk-in thefts\", where\nwallets and briefcases are stolen\nopportunistic ally. Security's advice\nis, as always, to lock doors even\nwhen leaving rooms unattended for\nonly a moment. AW\nOf course, the College is under no obligation\nto take the result into account - the referendum\nis only to register student opinion. When asked\nwhether the College was likely to take notice of\nthe result, Union President Sen Ganesh said\nthat he was \"sure the Rector would listen to the\nvoice of the student body... especially given\nrecent developments\".\nThe College has already seen one student\nprotest partly motivated by lack of student con-sul t ation, but its impact has yet to become obvious. Despite this, Mr Ganesh pointed out that it\nwas important to \"feed student opinion into the\nprocess\".\nStaff, however, will not be balloted despite\nthe Rector declaring the merger \"nonsense\"\nwithout approval of the academics - that voice\nwill have to come from the College Senate.\nWhether or not the student body's opinion,\nthrough this referendum, will be given the same\nweight remains to be seen.\nAW\nUnion Reception: Ransacked\nAlex vents further spleen on the\nsubject of procrastination\nFelix international begins it;\nglobal journey with a review\nthis past week's spectacular,\nDiwali night\nOur new fashion pages\nunderway, starting with th\u20ac\nshop hotspots of London\nNever a cross word said...

    "content": "FELIX LETTERS Your Letters\nTo Merge Or Not To Merge...\nHi Felix\nSo IC wants top-up fees, if the\ngovernment lets them. Bad news, I guess, but: Still not critical. We can\nvoice our disagreement and protest\n(but, please, not with GBP 31,000\nadverts full of factual errors!!!!). We\ncan make sure the government\nknow about the problems, and hope\nthey will make the right decision\n(i.e. to block top-up fees). And it's a medium term issue. We have time\nto oppose it.\nThe merger is not medium-term.\nThis is supposed to be decided by\nDecember, and it is the worst news\nfor us I 've heard in a while. Big may\nbe beautiful for finances and eco-nom ics, but a university is a rather\ndifferent thing. Universities are there\nto educate and to do research - both\nthings for the greater good, and, no\nmatter what politicians may think,\nnot (just) for profit.\nPut it like this: Before I came to\nEngland, I tried to figure out which\nuniversities (in Europe) would be\nbest for me (engineering degree).\nImperial and Cambridge came out\non top, together with a Dutch university (TU Delft, I think, but I'm not\nsure, I disregarded it because I don't speak Dutch). UCL was not even on\nthe list. Imperial may be smaller\nthan either Oxford or Cambridge,\nbut it is also more selective in the\ncourses it offers. Our university\nstands for a quality product - quality\neducation and quality research. And\nit stands for science and technology\n(and medicine) - subject areas at the\ncore of progress, and more important to society than any humanity\ncould ever be.\nOf course, we could join up with\nUCL but at what cost? UCL is not\nImperial. It is not even LSE.\nInternationally, it is an unknown.\nLSE don't want us, which is a pity,\nbut given that their brand name is as\nstrong as ours, it's understandable.\nBut does that mean we have to pick\nup any university with a campus in\nLondon, just so we nominally have\nmore students, and look more\nimportant? Together, the new\nUniversity would not be bad. But\nwould the combined thing be as\ngood as Imperial, i.e. world class?\nNo. We'd be above average. And\nthat, I'm afraid, is not good enough\nfor me. If I were to apply to universities next year, and face a combined\nUCL/IC option, it would not feature\non my application form.\nIn that spirit, would anyone care\nto organize a protest? ICU, perhaps?\nRegards\nI was at the Rector's meeting last\nweek, where he harped on about\nthe economic benefits that would be\nreaped as a result of the proposed\nIC/UCL merger, and how we would\nall come to realise the wisdom of his\nplan, once we saw the evidence.\nDoes he not realise that the opposition to this proposal might stem\nfrom something other than concern\nabout whether we were going to\nturn a profit from this? I'm talking\nabout patriotism to our university -1\ndon't want to see IC lose its identity\nbecoming just another faculty of\nsome London super-university,\nwhich it most certainly would, when\nfaced with the larger, and let's face\nit, more well-known UCL. Imperial\nhas only just gone through a merger,\nincorporating the medical schools\ninto the college - and we all know\nthat isn't now the happiest of mar-ri ages. The same sort of marginal-iz ation experienced by medics\nwould happen to the whole of IC,\nonly this time, there wouldn't be the\nchance for the same sort of insularity that the medics employ. IC, under\na merger, would just be swallowed,\noverwhelmed by the larger UCL,\nand the IC ethos and interests would\nbe cast aside in the interests of the\nnew institution.\nRichard Hutchinson (Medicine 3)\nMore Topping Up\nDear people,\nIt seems to me that many IC students think \"top-up fees\" are\ninevitable, consequently thats why I think a significant number of IC students arn't interested in taking any\nsort of action. I think it is safe to say\nthat the majority of IC students are\nagainst the top up fees, therefore \"us\nlot\" are in our thousands. Whilst\nthere is only one man at the top who\nwants to push these top up fees\nthrough. So when you think about\nthe potential mass op postion, these\nchanges are far from inevitable!!!\nAnd so, ladies and gents, girls and\nboys, I think it's about time more of\nus, including me, got more engaged\nin opposing these outrageous top up\nfees. Yours expecting ly, R. Mahfouz\nDear Felix,\nIs Syksey-boy's core proposal that\nthose wanting a good education\nshould have to pay for it, providing\nthat they are able, really such a bad\none? The answer, methinks is yes...\nish\nIs it not fair that an individual\nfrom a fairly affluent background (as\nthe typical IC student is despite\nwhat they may say) and who is also\nquite likely to get a well paid job,\nshould have to pay for it? Well, yes,\ni think so. Is it not also true that the\ncollege will have to find some way to\nmake up the \u00a32500 per student per\nyear that Sykes claims it loses\nthrough inadequate government\nfunding? Again, of course it must.\nBut top-up fees aren't the answer.\nSyke's proops als aren't actually all\nthat bad, providing that you start of\nwealthy-ish and get a well-paid job\nafterwards, but that is too often not\nthe case. We all know, that if you go\ninto research/academia, the salaries\nare rarely as good as those to be\ngained elsewhere, and are barely\nadequate to pay off the current levels of \u00a315k student debt let alone\nthe likely \u00a325k with top up fees.\nThis will only discourage IC students\nfrom taking up research positions,\nand act as an it el lect u al drain for the\ncollege.\nEqually the Rector's assertions\nthat students will be accepted on\nquality only, and that money will be\ntaken care of later, are very short-sighted. We all can cite examples of\nfriends who chose not to come to\nLondon on a cost basis. So although\nthe system may not officially discriminate against the less wealthy,\nin reality it is likely that some degree\nof the financial elitism seen in the\nIvy League will occur.\nSo where should the money come\nfrom? The fairest method would\nseem to be some sort of graduate\ntax. That way, there is no disincentive to go into research (which sure\nthe college wants and needs), and it\nmeans that those seeking their\ndegree purely to help them earn\nmore money, pay what they deserve\nto.\nYours,\nJon Field\nSouthside\nI was meaning to write here a long\ntime ago about Southside shop. I am surprised no one else has!\nWhen Basics Pizza was taken\nover by the Southside shop, I had\nmy doubts... Pizzas were good at\nBasics (well, on a basic level any-way), and the little Shop had such\na bad reputation for having overpriced items... even more expensive than Harrods in some cases!\nHowever, I loved the French cro is sants, so I knew I should give it a chance.\nThen they decided to make piz-z as., which was a good idea, as\nwe all need a good nibble when\nwe are drinking ourselves to the\nground. But the shop closes at\n9pm and they stop serving food at\n8.30pm.. who in their right mind\nhas thought about food by that\ntime on a night out?? 8.30pm is\nright about when you start thinking about having a pizza! After a couple of trials, I decided against\nthem anyway.\nThen there is the bread. A loaf\ncost \u00a31.15. That in itself is outrageous. Three times the price of a supermarket loaf. However, one\ncould think that you are not paying that price for the actual bread,\nbut for the convenient location of\nthe shop, and the fact that it is\nopen \"late\"... I could cope with\nthat. But what a furious reaction I had when I realised that only loafs\nwith best-by-dates for the next day\nwere for sale! Obviously, I experienced that first-hand a couple of\ntimes (by eating stale bread)\nbefore I realised this was a shop\npolicy!\nFinally, there is the mice. Have\nyou ever looked through the windows into the shop after closure?\nLast time I looked, there were half\na dozen mice making a feast of\nwhat was left over in the \"freshly\nprepared\" food section. It isn't the\nfirst time I see this, and I am not\nthe only who has noticed it either!\nSo basically, I am wondering\nwhy on earth the College has let\nthe Southside Shop area to a bunch of lazy French, who have\noverpriced gone off items (if not\nrun out of stock), are closed on\nSundays and most importantly\ndon't clean stuff out well enough\nto avoid mice infestation!\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

The first time\nround the songs covered were not\nnecessarily big hits and the acts\non the record were more consciously 'cool' than commercial.\nAs a result the profits were obviously not that great, as this time,\nall the tracks are No.l singles\nfrom the past fifty years, and your\ndad will have heard of almost all\nthe artists.\nMs Dynamite lays sweet,\nmature vocals over a straightforward cover of Soul 2 Soul's However Do You Want Me.\nFeeder and the Stereophonies\ncome up with emotionally\nwrought versions of The Power Of\nLove and Nothing Compares 2 U respectively. Kelly Jones does his\npredictable 'I'm very emotional'\nthing and Grant Nicholas, less\npredictably, pulls off the same.\nMy least favorite tracks are\nProdigy being The Specials and\nJimmy Eat World being Prodigy.\nBoth Ghost Town and Firestarter\nwere relevant at the time of their\nrelease in a political way and\nremoving that context leaves the\ncovers as strings of lyrics.\nThe standouts are Badly Drawn\nBoy with Come On Eileen which\nis genius in part because of\nJool's Holland's participation and\nin part because of Damon\nGough's talent for sounding pessimistic and optimistic all at\nonce. Also, it is revealed that\nGary Barlow could quite possibly\nhave been thinking of David\nMcAlmont when he was writing\nBack For Good, so perfectly do\nBernard Butler's partners soulful\ntones suit the track. (Maybe Gaz\nshould make a comeback as\nBernie's co-writer.)\nOn the covers front, I feel the\nway to go is faster and louder,\nwith more drums and shouting if\npossible. This record mostly goes\nthe other way, as it's for charity,\nso suffers as a result.\nSarah\nJakatta\nVisions\n4/5\nAMERICAN I BEAUTY\n\"At the third stroke, it will be\neleven fifty eight and ten sec-on ds\". So begins the new album\nfrom \"record collector/fanatic,\nmaster of disguise, disco\nmechanic and top notch producer and remixer\" (not my words)\nDave Lee AKA Jakatta. You\nknow, the one who did that\nAmerican Beauty song. The one\nwith the glockenspiel and the\nbreathy la-la-la-la-la-na-na-na.\nOh come on, its been on just\nabout every dance compilation\nfrom here to eternity for the last\nyear. And so herein lies the pro b lem, music like this is just too\nforgettable, too generic. The\nsleeve notes make a point of how\nmuch Dave loves the cinema and\nhow much this album is just\nwaiting to be commissioned for\nthe new Sam Mendes film. Don't be fooled by the singles, it does\nindeed sound like a film sound-track. A film about beaches and\nclouds and gently swooping birds\nand palm trees swaying in the\ncool sea breeze while the tide\nsoftly laps up onto the golden\nshore as a silhouetted man in a trench coat walks slowly towards\na battered shack. It is essentially,\na perfect ambient chill-out\nalbum, and while it may be technically accomplished and very\nwell arranged it just sounds the\nsame as itself and the other half\nmillion chill out albums avail-able. The aforementioned first\ntrack It Will Be has the standard\nissue, looping spaced out electro-piano layered with some light\njazz drumming, but then over the\ntop there's some bizarre bleeping\narrangement that sounds like\nTinky Winky trying to play the XFiles hook on a Casio keyboard.\nThe final track Strung Out is\nindeed very strung out and could\ndo with being about five minutes\nshorter, although with this being\nchill-out we don't want to rush\nthings too much do we?\nEverything in between follows\npretty much the same pattern of:\ngentle piano intra followed by\nsoft drum loop followed by floating in space noises (possibly with\nsome wispy female vocal) followed by some more piano/wood-wind and maybe even some random electronic noises, eventually\ngoing to artistic fade into the next\ntrack. Despite all this, it does\nwhat it does very well indeed.\nStick it on after a hard day at the\noffice, collapse into an oversized\narmchair or a hot bubble bath,\nclose your eyes and let the lush\nproduction and atmosphere take\nyou to a place infinitely more\nrelaxed and serene.\nDominic\nSingles\nColdplay - The Scientist\nProving that they still know\nhow to pen a damn fine rock\nballad, Coldplay's new single is\na poignant tale of enduring\nlove. The second to be taken\nfrom the band's ace new\nalbum, A Rush Of Blood To The\nHead, this starts with a simple\npiano refrain and Martin's tender vocals, before building\nsteadily with subtle orchestration and haunting harmonies\ntowards a rousing finale that'll\nhave you waving your lighter in\nthe air. \"Nobody said it was\neasy\", Martin claims, but with\nsongs these good, Coldplay\nmake success seem effortless.\n5/5 Tom Bell\nThe Coral - Dreaming of You\nIf you are a fan, you will find 2\nnew tracks on the single:\nAnswer Me which contrasts\nwith the happiness of\nDreaming of You. The tempo is\nslow, the voice is grave. Follow\nthe Sun belongs to another\ngenre - it sounds like the\ngarage rock of The White\nStripes, full of guitar and heavy\ndrums. The Coral show an\namazing diversity of style for a new band. If you haven't got\nthe album yet, you can try the\nsingle. Dreaming of You - one\nof the best songs of the album,\nto give you a good idea of The\nCoral sound: a joyful experience without restraint!\n4/5\nLuna - Lovedust\nMike\nPleasant and sentimental cho-rus-verse guitar pop.\nCompetent musicianship yet\nunimpressive lyrics. Lovedust\nis catchy but disposable.\nUnsophisticated but could stir\nthe heart in conjunction with\nmild intoxication\nIndu\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk \"You're not interested unless it's less than five minutes old and completely manufactured!\"\n\n"

SlmOne captures\nthe answer to the question; what if this newly\nfound sensation were never to appear in public at the height of her fame? How would the\npublic and the 'exclusive-story' starved\nmedia react?\nJust as every Scientist (or Palaeontologist)\nwould shudder at the words \"Jurassic Park\ncould really happen,\" the Computer Science\nDept in Imperial College may be slightly disgruntled by the somewhat dubious missing\nlinks in this film. In fact, anyone would be\npuzzled when trying to determine how Pacino\nwho, and I quote \"does not know how to use\ncomputers\" can somehow use, and develop\nthe amazing code given to him by the aforementioned dying man, thus allowing him to\ncreate a completely digital TV, Film, Music\nand Literary mega star, who also still finds\ntime to go on goodwill missions to the Third\nWorld (I swear I am not kidding!)\nIn short, this film does not intend to be\nrealistic (well, let's hope not!). Instead it tries\nto ask questions in a slightly patronising, yet\nintelligent, thought provoking manner about\nhow the modern world is obsessed with\nfame, celebrity and in general the lives of\nthose other than us. What would happen if a completely perfect person was created to fulfil our needs for someone to look up to/wor-ship/obsess? (please delete as applicable)\nIt's easy to watch, and will keep you entertained for the duration of its 135 minutes,\neven if it is just because you may well be seeing the first in a future string of Al Pacino\ncomedy-ish films, or even if you're trying to\nfind comparisons with director Niccol's vision\nof the future of Hollywood to the actual reality of today. Alarmingly it would seem we're\nnot too far away...\nMark out of ten: 000111... (that's a7 in\nbinary code). John\nSlmOne was released on 25th October\n2002, Cert. PG\nsigns The Culkin dynasty continues...\nStarring: Mel Gibson, Joaquin\nPhoenix, Cherry Jones\nDirector: M. Night Shyamalan\nRunning Time: 107 min\nSigns is the latest offering from Mr M Night\nShyamalan, the man responsible for none\nother than The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable.\nThe action centres around a one-parent family who come close to being munched by\nmarauding aliens, but drive them away. Oh,\nand in the process Mel Gibson reaffirms his\nfaith in God. Which he lost on talking to his\ndying wife, who happened to be pinned to a tree.\nI wouldn't like to call myself prejudiced,\nbut the omens can't be good for a film starring Macaulay Culkin's younger brother. You\nwould have thought they would have\nchanged his name or something, but no, it's like they think being associated with the\nOriginal Little Shit will actually help his\ncareer or something. Actually ick le Rory is a significant improvement on the older model,\nbut I digress...\nM Night Shyamalan has a reputation to live\nup to. After his two previous oe vres, one\nexpects unforeseen twists which at a stroke\nshow the plot's events in a different light.\nThere are many similarities to his earlier creations - the suspense, the use of child actors\n- but this is not one of them. The plot is\nobviously intended merely as a backdrop to\nthe characters themselves. Unfortunately\ntheir personae are too underdeveloped (or\nperhaps too typical) to be sufficiently emo-ti ve. One of the main themes running through\nthe film is about coincidences. Are they really happenstance, or maybe, just maybe,\ncould they be part of some grand design?\nThis is a masterstroke on old Nighty's part.\nNow it doesn't matter if the story is about as\nbelievable as Britney's knee operation,\nbecause it was all obviously meant to be. So\nthat's why the little girl thinks the water's contaminated! It's so that she leaves hundreds of glasses of the stuff lying around,\nbecause it kills the aliens. Someone give this\nman the Nobel Prize for Writing Logical\nScripts...\nAh yes, the script. What can the man who\ngave the world the immortal 'I see dead pe o ple' serve up this time? The enlightening,\n'Either these things are a hoax... or they're\nreal', and my personal favourite; Macaulay\njunior telling his 5 year old sister, 'do it - do\nit for your children'. As for the acting, the\nclich e machine is wheeled out with such\nabandon that poor old Mel et al really don't stand a chance. Joaquin Phoenix (who was\nobviously drafted in to lend some weight to\nthe cast and thus dupe stupid people like me\ninto going to see this film) makes the best of\na bad job, but his lines are too few and far\nbetween to make any real impact.\nTo be fair, the suspense (truly Mr\nShyamalan's speciality) is managed well, but\nthe shocks are too predictable and too few and\nfar between to call this a true horror movie. In\nconclusion, a contrived and tired slice of cine-ma, and to be avoided unless you want to\nhave Mel Gibson's babies or something.

The audience carried on unperturbed though, and\na short time later our patience\nwas rewarded.\nThe Lostprophets earned their\nreputation the hard way - on the\nroad. Gig after gig in small seedy\nvenues, slowly winning the\nyouth of the country over. Times\nhave changed however, and now\nthey're playing a large seedy\nvenue.\nThe throng now assembled\nwithin the fake splendour of the\nBrixton Academy welcome the\nband on stage with high expectations. The hardcore tour schedule of\nthe past few years shines\nthrough. The vocals hit every\nnote, with Ian and Jamie reaching the pinnacle of their talent\nduring \"and she told me to\nleave\" - even the onstage light\nshow is flawless.\nYou might think for all this\nprofessionalism, the show might\nseem contrived, but no. The six\nmen on stage radiate a contagious energy, which infects the\ncrowd, made visible when the\nentire venue starts jumping up\nand down in time to the chorus\nof Fake Sound Of Progress - the\ntitle track from the album the\nLostprophets have been peddling since 1999.\nAs they tore through this\nalbum, injecting it with new life\nin the process, we were treated\nto the odd new song, slipping in\nbetween the present classics.\nThese were impressive tasters\nthat did not disturb the pace,\nsound or mood of the set - definitely a good sign of things\ncome. They proved once again,\nthere is nothing like pure\nunadulterated talent turned up\nto maximum volume.\nRunning through the album\ntrack list in my head I realised\nthey were running out of stuff to\nplay. With only one song left the\nLostprophets finished on a win-ner, Shinobi Vs Dragon Ninja,\nAnd once again the venue\njumped together, with even more\nenergy than the first occasion.\nAll this and I still wanted\nmore, even if it was just the\nsame set played over again.\nAlas, the encore never came and\nthe crowd were left clinging to\nfront man lan's promise of a new\nalbum.\nAlison\nMushroomhead 5/5\nWednesday 16th October, The Marquee\nI was a little apprehensive about\nthis gig. Mushroomhead had\nreceived mixed reviews from\nmost of the media and the fact\nthat they looked a little too much\nlike Slipknot didn't fill me with\nconfidence. I feel I should point\nout that Mushroomhead have\nbeen around for longer than\nSlipknot and should not be written off as a mere spin off. Still it\nwas somebody's job to review\nthem so, armed with pen and\npaper, I arrived at the newly reopened Marquee. The first thing\nI noticed about the stage was\nthat a group of roadie s had\nstrung up a brown paper screen\nin front of stage that obscured all\nof the preparations. Then, after a short wait, the lights dimmed\nand strange noises began to\ncome from behind the wall of\nbrown paper. A couple of power\nchords later the paper dropped\ndown to reveal all eight of the\nband wearing pumpkin masks\ncombined with grey army outfits\n(not too conventional but still\nquite impressive looking).\nThen began the music, a strange combination of heavy\nriffs, piano melodies (yes that's right - piano), haunting backing\nvocals plus some shouting for\ngood measure. The sound is\nprobably influenced by the likes\nof Fear Factory and other metal\nbands. There are also the the-at ric s. After their opening number the lights cut out for a few\nseconds after which they reappear in their more traditional\noutfits, apart from backing singer\nJeffrey Nothing who was sporting some sort of Darth maul outfit complete with full make up.\nWhat can I say? I was very\nimpressed. Their sound was\ncrisp, they worked the crowd\nwell and once you got a feel for\nthe songs they were actually\nquite good. If you're still sce pti cal, my advice would be to listen\nto a couple of their tracks and, if\nyou like what you hear, this is\ndefinitely a gig worth seeing. If\nyou're a bit of a teeny-mosher,\ngrab your korn hoo dies and mosh\nyour hearts off. In order to enjoy\nthis band even more have plenty\nto drink to get you in the mood.\nSean\nAlbums\nThe Gloria Record - Start Here\nImagine a world where Vex\nRed were brought up in a nice\nneighbourhood, had all the\nnew toys and instead of being\nthe weir does at school were\nthe popular kids that everybody liked. A world where Ross\nRobinson preferred candy floss\nand fluffy bunnies to guns and\ncrows' heads, and the only\nroad for a new band to go\ndown was the same road as\neverybody else.

To\nthen inhale helium and\nattempt an impression of Thorn\nYorke with a cold for half an\nalbum is a bit ridiculous.\nUltimately, the semi-angst-emo-lite leaves you with a distinct feeling that you've been\nhere before, you did all this\nyears ago and you have several\nt shirts to prove it.

    "content": "FELIX COLUMN Q3\nBy Students, For Students\nUCL Merger\nAs most of you know, last week it\nwas announced that Imperial\nCollege was entering merger talks\nwith University College London.\nThe proposed merger must not\ncome as too much of a surprise.\nThis has been a trend within the\nUK. Recent high profile mergers\nhave included UMIST and\nManchester, and Guildhall and\nNorth London. There seems to be\na clear strategy to create large\nhigher education institutions that\ncan gain the \"critical mass\" to\ncompete on the global scale.\nThese mergers would radically\nchange the tertiary education\nlandscape in the UK.\nThe College is entering a wide\nconsultative process to consider\nthe key issues relating to the proposed merger. A joint Board, consisting of five members from each\nCollege has been set up to look at\nthe proposed merger and it will be\nfocusing on the high level issues,\nthe so-called \"icebergs\" rather\nthan the detailed implementation\nissues.\nThe Board has set up subgroups\nto look at key areas of operation,\nspecifically academic, administrative , governance and associated\nacademic issues such as libraries.\nThese subgroups will report to the\nBoard at the end of November and\nthe Board in turn will report to the\nrespective governing bodies on the\n19th December with a view to\nmaking a decision on that day.\nSo what is the Union doing? The\nUnion has called for a referendum\non whether the students believe\nthat Imperial College should\nmerge with UCL. This means\nthere will be a college wide ballot\nof the students, so every student\nwill the opportunity to have their\nsay. The proposed dates for the\nballot are Monday 25th and\nTuesday 26th of November. There\nwill be two campaigns, one for Yes\nand one for No, so you will have\nthe chance to hear all the pros\nand cons of the proposed merger.\nThere will be debates and information accessible to all. Similarly\nUCL Union will also be calling a referendum to gauge the view of\ntheir students.\nThe Union will be neutral and aim\nto provide facts and figures in an\nunbiased way. The same information will be provided to both parties who in turn will present their\ncase to the student populous.\nOnce the referendum is complete,\nwe will have a clear indication of\nthe students' views and be in a position to represent them to the\nCollege and the Board.\nThis is potentially the biggest\nchange that Imperial College has\nfaced in its entire history. It is critically important that you are\ninvolved in the process and have\nyour say. Make sure you get\ninformed, listen to the arguments\nand make an educated choice.\nSen Ganesh, President\nShould Imperial College and\nUniversity College London (UCL)\nmerge?\nDo you have a view? Want to get involved with running the Yes or the No campaign?\nContact Sen Ganesh (president@ic.ac.uk) for more information.\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX SPORT firsts run rampant\nGKT I23 Imperial I Made our way to their\ngrounds in Cobham, on a sunny Saturday morn in only to find a mixture\nleaves and long grass\nwhere the pitches were\nmeant to be. But we\nwent out to play our\nfootball!\nWe kicked off well\nand were playing1 some pretty attractive\nfootball, building the\nplay nicely from the\nback, keeping possession\noff the ball. And then\nabout 20 minutes into the\nhalf, a through ball to\nstriker and alas! the skipper\n(me) gave away a penalty! Well\n- to quote the words of legends\nof the past: \"I... had to do some-thing!\" (repeat 43230 times). It\nwas all part of the greater plan\nto make the game more interest-ing, anyway. Penalty went in,\ndown 1-0. That didn't seem to\nput us off though, so about 5\nminutes after that we came back\nto score. Clever throw in by\nJoss, flick on header in the box\nby Wez, and Mark with a cool\nfinish, 1-1. All square and all to\nplay for, and although we looked\nthe better side, it was pretty\neven. And then, out of nowhere,\nWez comes up with a brilliant\nturn on a through pass, to leave\ntheir defender standing and\nwondering where he was... one\non one with the keeper and 1-2\nto us. Kept the pressure on, Anis\nmanaging to miss - was it a clearance? - a header on the\nline! Then, from a corner the\nball falls to their man in the 6-yard box, a shot finding Ant's hand on the line. The ref\nblows... penalty and a red card!\nCarlos almost saved it, but the\nball ended up in the net. It was\nall part of the greater plan! We\nmanaged to keep it 2-2 till half-time.\nWe had to keep playing 3 at\nthe back, as we wanted to win\nthis. Despite being down to ten\nmen we came out a lot stronger\nin the\nsecond half. They couldn't create any real chances, finding a solid defence in front of them.\nOur midfield gave it their all,\ntaking control in the middle of\nthe park. And so, came the\nchances... Jeff wasted a couple\n- still part of the plan - but it\nwas time for us to put our third\naway. Mathan was running\ndown the right, looked more like\nhe was dancing past players,\nrather than dribbling, pulls a great ball back to Jeff, who\nmade it 2-3 for us!\nAfter that it was Imperial all\nover. It took 15 minutes of good\ndefending and organised play to\nreach full-time! 2-3 it was to\nImperial and a very well\ndeserved win! Congratulations\ngents - mission accomplished.\nImperial 1 4 - 1 ICSM I First home game this season\nwas against the medics. Can't really see the point in playing\nthem, as we always win, but as\nit's always fun to give the\nmedics a good beating - and it\nwas a nice sunny day as well -so why not go? Started off quite\nrusty, actually allowing them to\nget the better of us for the first\n10-15 minutes. It was around\nthen we decided to take things a bit more seriously. We were\nstill not playing our best,\nhowever, and around\n25 minutes into the\nhalf we got our\nfirst. A lovely\nthrough ball\nbrought Dave\none on one\nwith the\nkeeper, and\nhe finally\nscored with\nhis second\nshot - after\ntaking about\n10 years. That\ndidn't really\nseem to wake us\nup either, but we\nwere still in total con-of the game. Near the\nend of the half, we got our\nsecond: a cleverly taken corner\nkick by Mark, picking out Joss,\nwho, using his head, placed it\nbeautifully at the top right cor-ner.\nIn the second half things started to look a bit better for us,\nalthough it was still not a very\ngood performance.\nWez came on 5 minutes into\nthe half, scoring his first IC goal,\nwithin 3 minutes, with a shot\nfrom the edge of the box. Our\nfourth came not long after that,\nanother great delivery from\nMark's corner kick, Mathan taking advantage of his height (?) to\nwin the header at the penalty\nspot, placing it over the keeper...\n4-0. We thought the game was\nover after that, so we relaxed a bit too much. This unfortunately\nallowed them to score. A dreadful mistake by the skipper (me)\nand their man was through one\non one with Tim, beating him to\nmake it 4-1.\nEven though we were not\nhappy with our performance, we\nstill give them the beating they\ndeserved. Which was nice.\nthirds slip\nIC III 24 - 35 Kingston II\nA disappointing result to a hard\nfought game - but at the end of\nthe day it's the team who\nscores the most points who\nwin.\nThis game did prove beyond\nany doubt that, if nothing else,\nthat the thirds are a team of\nguile and flexibility.\nMost of the team were playing out of position throughout\nthe game, and even with a mere fourteen men we dominated the first half, only losing\npoints to the overlap created by\nbeing a man down.\nMike's number eight pickup\ntry was lifted straight from the\nhallowed pages of the RFU\ncoaching manual, and when\nDan came inside Alex (ahem -ed) it really was a joy to watch.\n'Hard Yards' - as Laurence\nDallaglio coined - was our\nforte, not only from the for-wards, notably from Sachin,\nbut also from the backs, such\nas our fly half James 'Crash\nBall' Walker who played really\nwell and provided a great try\nfor Alex in his new position at\ninside centre.\nMan of the match had to be\nChris Gosden, who despite\nplaying out of position at scrum\nhalf was confident and successful. His kicking was excellent and he provided the only\npoints that we scored from the\nboot all game. His excellent\nawareness also bore fruits in a well earned try.\nWith ten minutes to go we\nwere trailing 24-25, so we\nbrought on Neil, and the rest,\nas they say, is history...\nMost importantly, though we\nwon the drinking game.

Bitter PopRival fans\non one side reeling from the ugly\nguy's departure the night before,\ntourists on the other side taking a short break from the open top bus.\nThe Caribbean shores felt thousands of miles away. In the summer of 2002, 10 of the IC net-ball ers lived every university girl's dream: a fortnight in Barbados.\nThere was drinking, dancing,\nfamous footballers, and a few\ngames of netball on the way. We\nwere competing in the 4th annual\nBajan Unifest 2002, with 110\nother sportspeople from universities in Britain, USA and Barbados,\ncovering the sports of netball,\nhockey, cricket and football.\nBarbados is where it's at when it\ncomes to netball. Men and women\nalike play it, follow it and understand it, and they get the fantastic\nresults.\nSaturday 22nd June: The morning after the night before. It's a mystery how we all made it to\nGatwick, but we did, all be it in a variety of physical states. Eight\nhours, 4 films and an ice cream\nlater, we landed in sunny, breezy,\npalm-tree-packed Barbados.\nVirgins to rum punch, this was the\nnight that changed our lives and\nshaped them for weeks to come.\nThe \"Unifest Welcome Party\"\nkicked off at a nearby hotel.\nConditions deteriorated when our\nleader Jo Harvey leaped into the\nhotel pool fully clad, briskly pursued by 40 Heriot Watt boys...\nSunday 23rd June: Our first\nintensive training session...on the\nbeach...in between sunbathing.\nThere was an official Opening\nCeremony for the Unifest com pet i tion, and the Imperial Ladies were\nabout to play the first game of the\ntournament.\nFixture 1: Venue Sir Garfield\nSobers Sports Complex, Team:\nCarrington, Barbados\nThe IC touring team is unbeaten\nin Britain. It arises from the fact\nwe had never played together\nbefore. Leading from the start, we\nfinished with a draw at 11-11, not\nbad for our first game. In the\nhottest conditions we've ever\nplayed in, games were only in 15-minute halves, rather than our\nusual 15-minute quarters. The\nend of the games showed noticeable superiority to the local teams\nas they had barely broken sweat,\nwhilst we were close to needing\nhospital treatment.\nNo one was injured during the\ntour. Any accidents were always\nalcohol related\nMonday 24th June: White sandy\nbeaches, big waves in a warm\nsea, palm trees, Chefette (the\nCaribbean's answer to\nMcDonalds), and strawberry milkshakes for Holly. What a life! The\nHarbour Lights nightclub is one of\nthe most famous on the island.\ndownpour would have been quite\nhomely and it made us feel the\nadvantage of being English.\nHowever, the advantage was lost\nwhen the opposition ran off the\ncourt for shelter. The game was\nabandoned and declared a draw.\nEarlier in the day, the IC netball\nteam were alleged to have been\nseen building a human pyramid\non the beach. It was Jo who had\nto climb to the top of the pyramid,\nbut nose-dived off the summit,\nresulting in a face full of sand,\nwon ky glasses, and 9 laughing-so-much-it-hurts mates standing\nbeside her. It was all, however, in\naid of the Unifest Talent Show at\nThe Rusty Pelican that night. With\nFor \u00a38.00 entry fee, we had free\ndrinks all night. Stilt-men were\nencountered, and woo-ed. Clare\ndemonstrated her rag ga singing\nskills in Carribbean karaoke, and\nwe danced the night away with\nthe New Zealand cricket team.\nTuesday 25th June Fixture 2:\nVenue: Sir Garfield Sobers Sport\nComplex, Team Eden Stars,\nBarbados\nA team, the mere mention of\nwhose name sends shivers down\nthe spine of every Bajan man and\nwoman. They were a far better\nteam than Carrington, possessing\nthe rather fortunate gift of go-go\ngadget arms. We lost the first half\n7-2. Sherry came in as\nGoalkeeper and put in a fantastic\nperformance, as she did in all\ngames. Following a defiant come-back, the heavens opened. Had it\nnot been warm, the torrential\na highly polished dance\nroutine(one that the IC Rugby\nboys, who came to Barbados in\nweek two, were treated to many\ndrunken viewings of), the human\npyramid had only been practiced\non the sand. A tiled and slippery\nfloor was not the finest morale\nbooster. However, Jo made it to\nthe top of the pyramid with ease\n(the power of rum punch) and\nflashed to the cheering crowd - in\nher own words, \"Nakedness wins,\ngirls, nakedness wins\". We lost.\nWe spent the evening drowning\nour sorrows and learning how to\ndance Bajan-style with the\nCarrington Netballers. Holly and\nStuxy proved to be naturals (or\nwas it that they were the most\ndrunk..)\nWednesday 26th June Fixture 3:\nVenue: National Stadium Team\nBarbados Under 16s. Today we were representing\nEngland in a battle of the nations,\nplaying the Barbados Under 16s at their national stadium. It could\nhave been a car park actually, but\nwe were assured that it wasn't. The temperature was intense; the\ncourt had high concrete walls surrounding it, the sun beat down.\nThe U16s were an outstanding\nteam, playing beautiful netball\nand we lost 21-6. The old girls\namong us (Jess, Kath, Hannah\nand myself) were happy that our\nlast game together representing IC\nwas against a national team, and\nthat it had been a great game. It\nled, of course, to another scandalous night at Harbour Lights\ninvolving stilt men, Heriot Watt\nboys and vast amounts of rum\npunch.\nThursday 27th June: The Unifest\nBeach Party at The Boatyard.\nThere was jet-skiing, kayaking,\nbeach volleyball, football and\nkayak-racing (in which Jo crashed\ninto a very large, very obvious,\nquite how she didn't see it no one\nknows, inflatable iceberg). Sherry\nlives in Barbados and introduced\nus to the craziest bus service I have ever had the misfortune of\ncoming across. Taxis with a seating capacity of 10. Except they\ndon't seat 10. For $1.50, we\ncould get wherever we wanted, at\nan insane speed, on a pot-holed\nroad, listening to rag ga music very\nloudly, with 22 other people\nwedged above, beneath and\nbeside you. We met Sol Campbell\nthat evening, signifying the start of\na beautiful story between him and\none of us. So that the girls can\navoid hassle from the tabloids, I shall leave the story there...\nFriday 28th June: Another intensive training session on the\nbeach.. Virgin Atlantic held a shoot-out competition in which\nwhoever got the best out of 3\ngoals won a return trip to\nBarbados. Hannah and Holly were\nthe only girls to score 1. A defender from St.Marys won. Off to\nOistins Fish Fry Market in the\nevening, yet more drinking games,\nand finishing off in Harbour\nLights,again.

It happened to me.\nThe scratching at the door became a crescendo, and he burst in bare-toothed and wild-eyed; arms flailing and making his way towards us - the\nattack was as swift as it was elegant. I remember his insane grin: an evil\nclown's grin which flashed wickedly in the moonlit room, like a collection\nof icicles in a bat filled cave. I saw his weapon - a retractable blade, like\na miniature Stanley Knife. So, my assailant was a homicidal paranoia c with a penchant for arts and crafts - already he was betraying his weaknesses to us. He lunged forward, I dodged and wheeled round, forcing\nhim near the window where what little light the Moon provided might\ngive me the edge. What could I have done to anger him so? Hours ago\nthis man was normal - what changed, what caused such a polarisation?\nWho knows what goes on inside the mind of a psychotic?\nHe caught me unawares, pressing the weapon to my gut, but retracting the blade just before contact was made. He was toying with me.\nGrabbing the nearest weapon/shield/item around me, I threw a blanket\nover him - entangling the attacker like a dolphin-un-friendly net. Yelling\nthe old adage/war-cry \"the worm is faster than the sword!\", I proceeded\nto beat him with the business end of a tennis racket, and bundle him out\nof the door at the same time. Once out of the room, the door was barricaded. I looked at my associate, out of breath. \"Anyone can flip.\" I whispered. \"Anyone can flip.\" Anon\nTHE LYRICS1. \"There are things that I regret, like being called a nervous wreck\nand working up another sweat for you.\"\n2. \"You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat, who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.\"\n3. \"I met a girl who sang the blues, and I asked her for some happy\nnews...but she just smiled and turned away.\"\n4. \"Face to face, out in the heat. Hangin' tough, stay in' hungry. They\nstack the odds still we take to the street, for the kill, with the skill\nto survive.\"\n5. \"I was try in' to catch your eye, thought that you was try in' to hide.\nI was swallowing my pain, I was swallowing my pain.\"\n6. \"I 've got no kick against modern jazz, unless they try to play it too\ndarn fast; and change the beauty of the melody, until they sound\njust like a symphony.\"\n7. \"We're heading for Venus and still we stand tall, 'cause maybe\nthey've seen us and welcome us all.\"\n8. \"I woke up again this morning with the Sun in my eyes, when Mike\ncame over with a script surprise: a Mafioso story with a twist, a 'Too Wong Foo, Julie Newmar' hitch.\"\n9. \"You're a nut! You're crazy in the coconut!\"\n10. \"Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids. In fact, it's cold as\nhell.\"\nANSWERS TO G FLQ12451. Ooberman - Physics Disco\n2. Gerry Rafferty - Baker Street\n3. Jerry Reed - Eastbound and Down\n4. The Clash - Should I Stay Or Should I Go?\n5. The Levellers - Julie\n6. The Sugarhill Gang - Rapper's Delight\n7.
