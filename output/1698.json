The\nmodern state was inexorable in its ability to extend\nits influence around the\nglobe, to the point that\nwhere there are humans,\nthere are now states to\ngovern them. The nation\nstate has the capacity to\ncare and protect or punish\nand persecute its citizens.\nIt is the potential for government tyranny over its\ncitizens that motivates opposition to the expansion\nof the state. The idea of\nwhat constitutes tyranny\nby the state is broad and\ncan range from actual\nphysical force being employed by the state against\nits citizens to the act of\ntaxing a citizen\u2019s wealth\nor income. However,\nthis potential for tyranny\nallows states to provide\nmany vital functions, such\nas the enforcement of the\nrule of law, the provision\nof a safety net for those citizens that are unfortunate\nin their circumstances,\nand the provision of vital\npublic goods.\nThe degree to which\nyou trust the state, there-fore, depends on by how\nmuch you think that the\nstate\u2019s tyranny has the potential to provide benefit\nto you and yours, as well\nas how the application of\nthe state\u2019s tyranny aligns\nitself with your values.\nNearly everyone acknowledges the potential\nof states to produce large\nchanges within society,\nbut there are questions\nover whether state intervention makes problems\nworse, as well as the extent\nto which it is the state, not\nother social forces, such as\nmarket economics, solve\nthe problems instead. In\nmy opinion, despite the\ncapitulation of many politicians to market forces\nin the modern day, it is\nevident from the historical\nrecord of the power of\nthe state to force social\nchange. Just looking at\nthe history of the UK,\nobvious examples of state\ndriven social change come\nto mind- redistribution of\nclergy lands, provision of\nmass education, provision\nof a unified infrastructure,\nthe development of an\nindependent judiciary, as\nwell as countless other\nsmall but significant\ndevelopments that shaped\nthe development of the\nUK we see today.\nIn terms of modern\nsocial change, the market\neconomy is firmly in\ncontrol, leading to the\nforce that is increasingly driving political\nresentment and political\nre-evaluation: inequality.\nThe difference between\nthe wealth held by the\nrichest and the poorest\nhas sky-rocketed over the\nlast 40 years. Despite the\nfact that the growth of the\nworld economy has led\nto decreases in poverty\nin absolute terms (ish),\nthe growth in wealth inequality is fundamentally\ndangerous to the continued functionality of the\nworld\u2019s political systems,\nparticularly democracies.\nIn oppressive political\nsystems, populist movements can be repressed, as\nhas occurred in many of\nthe countries involved in\nthe Arab Spring, as well\nas in Hong Kong.\nHowever, in democratic countries, populism\nis a force that can be\nutilised for political gain.\nThey can be seen gaining\nmomentum everywhere\nagainst the status quo,\nwhether it is Duterte in\nthe Philippines, Erdogan\nin Turkey, or most sig-nificantly, Trump in the\nUS. Populist politicians\nare dangerous by dint of\ntheir power base, as the\nmob is capricious and will\nsupport policies that may\nbe viable in the short term\nbut are unsustainable in\nthe long term. An excellent example would be\nthat Trump has simultaneously lowered taxes and\nprosecution for those that\nhad driven us to the crisis\npoint in the first place,\nwhilst austerity policies\nwere enacted across many\nnations in order to balance\nthe books. 10 years later,\nand the effects of austerity are still being felt by\nthe most vulnerable in\nsociety, fuelling populist\nmovements around the\nworld.\nIn order to correct this\nimbalance in wealth, and\ntherefore the respective\npowers of the masses and\nthe elites, governments\nmust become far less\nlaissez faire. They must\nraise taxes to pre-1970s\nlevels (~70% for the\nhighest level of income)\nand regulate markets\neffectively in order to\nreduce corruption. They\nmust stop the privatisation\nof areas vital to the public\ngood, such as education\nand healthcare, under\nthe illusion that it makes\nthese services better and\nmore efficient. The only\nconsequence of privatis-ing these industries is to\nmake them more efficient\nat generating profit for\nthe owners, as a perfect\nmarket for these services\ncannot develop.\nDemocratic governments should no longer\nbe afraid to lead the\nway in redistributing\nwealth from the richest\nto the poorest. Instead of\nrelying on charity, which\nis reliant on fickle human\nkindness at the best of\ntimes, we should choose\nto use existing political\nstructures to shape our\nsociety to be more fair\nand just. We can no longer\nafford to do otherwise if\nwe want out democratic\ninstitutions to continue\ninto the future.\nInequality made this guy happen // Flickr\n\u201cDemocratic\ngovernment\nshould no\nlonger be\nafraid to\nredistribute\nwealth from\nthe richest to\nthe poorest\u201d\nincreased spending. The\nrise of a populist party can\nbe prevented by the implementation of sensible\neconomic policies that\ndistribute wealth fairly\namongst its citizens.\nThe fact that this has not\nhappened is an example\nof the consequences when\nthe elites in a society are\ncapable of disproportionately influencing government economic policy.\nThe disproportionate\ninfluence of the elites was\nnever more evident than\nat the time of the global\nfinancial crisis. Banks\nthat collapsed were bailed\nout, with limited or no\n\n"

Despite living\nabout 40 minutes away in\nNorth West London and\nquite literally being given\nthe whole day to arrive, I\nsomehow still managed\nto arrive half an hour\nlate to Gabor Hall. After\npromptly moving my\nstuff into my room and\nchecking out my kitchen\ncupboard space, I was then\nmistaken for a cleaner by\nthe first of my floor mates\nthat I approached to introduce myself. They must\nhave thought it was \u201cbring\nyour family to work day\u201d!\nMy swift transformation\ninto a social pariah wasn\u2019t\nhelped by my decision to\nskip the floor meet-and-greet. Instead, I opted to\ngo for a cheeky Nando\u2019s\ntrip, simultaneously\nsucceeding in isolating\nmyself and inadvertently\nadhering to two black\nstereotypes: being late\nand loving chicken.\nI must admit it has been\nvery bizarre and feelt\nalmost surreal for me to\nhave technically finished\nuniversity but still be\ncoming back to the same\ncampus I just spent four\nyears at, on a daily basis.\nI\u2019m often tempted to\nresume my normal routine\nof napping in my usual\nspot at the back of LT 2\nin the Chem Eng depart-ment. For me, this role\npresented an unmissable\nopportunity to cling to my\nyouth by prolonging my\nstay at university (in some\ncapacity) and deferring\nmy entry into the \"real\nworld\" for another year. If\nfour years at Imperial has\ntaught me anything, it is\nhow to procrastinate and\nplagiarise effectively.\nAs a serial procrastina-tor, it should come as no\nshock to anybody that I\nam currently writing this\neditorial four hours before\nthe looming print deadline\nand I'm desperately\nwaffling to fill up space.\nWhat better way to waffle\nthan to explain my route\ninto Felix in painstaking\ndetail?\nI first got involved in\nFelix two years ago, as\na music writer. I am a\nmassive fan of hip-hop\n(Kendrick Lamar, Drake\nand J. Cole being my three\nfavourite artists right\nnow), and regularly found\nmyself writing album\nreviews and discussing\nhip-hop culture in general.\nFelix was an easy way for\nme to express my views\nfor anybody that fancied\na read. The natural\ntransition was to become\na Music Editor, a role\nI fulfilled last year and\nthoroughly enjoyed.\nThis year, I bid\nfarewell to my beloved\nMusic section, leaving\nit in the capable hands\nof Simran, Asad, Adrian\nand Henry. My amateur\nmusic journalism has bled\nout into my podcast, \"2\nGs in a Pod\" (shameless\nplug!). This is something\nof a passion project of\nmine but please give it a\nlisten on SoundCloud and\niTunes if you ever want to\nhear me debate music and\nhip-hop culture with my\nco-host, Isaac.\nThis year, I embark on\na new challenge as Editor-in-Chief. Although I\ntrytomaintainacool,calm\nand collected exterior, as\nthe print deadline edges\never close, I'm internally\nfeeling the same nerves\nI expect many of you are\nfeeling as you start this\nnew chapter in your life.\nLet's encourage eachother\nto wreck-it like Ralph and\nmake the most of these\nnew beginnings; we got\nthis!\n2\nFelix is recruiting!\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you!

    "content": "Felix Film\u2019s Student Essentials\nSo, you\u2019ve just moved into halls and have some idle time to spare \u2013 check out these coming-of-age gems that\nevery student should see.\nFILM\nSung Soo Moon\nFilm Editor\nAidan Chan\nFilm Editor\nL\niterally translating to \u201cAnd\nYour Mother\nToo\u201d, Y Tu Mama\nTambien is a coming-of-age film set in Mexico\nabout two young men and\nan older woman searching\nfor an invented beach\ncalled \u201cla Boca del Cielo\u201d,\nor \u201cHeaven\u2019s Mouth\u201d.\nTwo teenagers, Tenoch\nand Julio, entice Luisa\nto accompany them on a\njourney that challenges\ntheir friendship. It is in la\nBoca del Cielo where the\nboys become men, as the\nraw and rural landscape of\nMexico seduce the trio in\nways the city couldn\u2019t. We\nride along on this bittersweet road trip with these\ncharacters and become\nnostalgic ourselves, as the\nfilm leaves plenty of room\nto ponder. The film is\nbeautifully photographed\nby frequent collaborator\nEmmanuel Lubezki, and\nCuaron\u2019s trademark long\ntake is a perfect way into\nthe socio-political subtext within the film. The\nframe gracefully wanders\naround the scene \u2013 the\ncamera movement is robustly choreographed like\nthat of a dance routine.\nUsing these devices,\nCuaron maturely depicts\nimmaturity in a way that\nis neither exploitative\nnor sugar-coated. It\u2019s\nan important film in\nthe back-catalogue of\nCuaron, who went on to\ndirect Harry Potter and\nthe Prisoner of Azkaban,\nChildren of Men and\nGravity. Y Tu Mama\nTambien is masterful in\nits vibrant portrayal of the\ncusp of adolescence and\nadulthood.\n\u201cCuaron\nmaturely\ndepicts\nimmaturity\nin a way that\nis neither\nexploitative\nnor sugarcoated.\u201d\n\u201cJohn Keating\nis the mentor\nwe all hope\nwe had, a\nmentor who\nencourages\nus to do the\nthings we\nwant before\ntime runs out\u201d\n\u201cThis is not based on\na true story,\u201d the movie\nopens. Then the \u201cnot\nbased on\u201d disappears,\nleaving \u201cThis is a true\nstory\u201d. American Animals\nis about four friends\nwho plot a heist to inject\nexcitement into their\notherwise mundane lives\n\u2013 it is based on the events\nthat took place in 2004,\nin Lexington, Kentucky.\nTheir target? $12 million\nworth of rare books\nhoused at the University\nof Transylvania library,\nonly guarded by one\nold librarian. Contrary\nto the great tradition of\nglitzy and glamourous\ncaper movies, American\nAnimals juggles into the\nmix a more somber com-ing-of-age element. What\nstarts off as a harmless\nattempt in making their\nlives \u2018special\u2019 quickly\ntwists into something\nnastier; all spawning\nout of the shared feeling\nof wanting more than\nmediocrity. Writer-Director Bart Layton uses\ninterview footage of the\nreal people involved in\nthe heist throughout the\nfilm, which is a device he\nhas used before. Layton\u2019s\ndirectorial debut, The\nImposter, similarly\ninterweaved re-enact-ments with documentary\nfootage; the reverse has\nbeen done in American\nAnimals, where the narrative is mostly told through\nactors with interjections\nfrom the real criminals.\nA hugely enjoyable true-crime film, perfect for fans\nof Making a Murderer and\nAmerican Vandal.\nArguably one of the\ngreatest high school\ndramas, Dead Poets\nSociety tells the story of\nhow English teacher John\nKeating (Robin Williams)\ninspires his students to\nlive their lives to the\nfullest. Carpe diem, or\n\u2018seize the day\u2019, a phrase\nvolcanically popularised\nby the film, perfectly\nencapsulates Keating\u2019s\nphilosophy and the film\u2019s\ncentral theme. Bolstered\nby resounding performances and an impeccable screenplay, Dead\nPoets Society remains\ninfinitely relatable up to\nthis day. High school, the\ntime when limitless hopes\nfor the future intersects\nwith the impending realisation of adulthood. How\nmany have wanted to lead\nextraordinary lives, and\nhow many have given in\nto reality? John Keating\nis the mentor we all hope\nwe had, a mentor who\nencourages us to do the\nthings we want before\ntime runs out. And at the\nend of the day, it does not\nreally matter whether we\nhad a John Keating in our\nlives; Dead Poets Society\nimplores us to be the John\nKeating of other people,\nto be the captain to those\nwho are lost, simultaneously enriching our own\nlives.

You might\nhave been the best in your\nschool, at the top of your\nclass, but you are now\nmixing with individuals\nthat are truly your equal.\nMost of you will adapt to\nthis fairly well, but some,\nprobably indirect contributors to r/iamverysmart,\nwill continue to persist in\nthe fallacy that they are\nstill clever. Learn fast, or\nit will crush you.\nFollowing this sage\nadvice, I hope that you\nhave exploited your fresher\u2019s week to the best of\nyour ability and mingled\nwith your peers at the uni\nhalls of your choice. If\nyou are a student with the\ndubious honour of possessing a name that is hard\nto pronounce, be prepared\nfor one of two reactions:\neither people will butcher\nit, and continue to butcher\nit for the rest of your life,\nor some pedant will insist\non pronouncing it perfect-ly. The best way of getting\nround it is to never tell\nanyone your name, and\nbe eternally referred to as\neither that guy or that girl.\nFor all freshers, I hope\nyou are fond of the people\nthat you\u2019ve met over the\nlast week. Prepare to\nabandon them and give\nthem an embarrassed nod\nof recognition every time\nyou pass them in a small\ncorridor or rub up against\nthem in Metric.

Going\nto Metric can occur in a\nsimilar manner to serious\ndrug abuse. Initially you\nwill attend out of sheer\nthe following morning,\nthe main emotion will\nbe self-revulsion, but the\nhooks are in your brain.\nRepeated use will occur,\nin some cases creating a\ndangerous dependency.\nOverall, your experience of Imperial will\nnot be determined by the\ncourse you have selected\nor the place you live, but\nby the people you meet\nand the friends you make.\nWith that in mind, I can\nalmost guarantee that your\nexperience will be terrible.\nThat is the environment\nthat you create when you\ncram all that ambition to\nbe an investment banker\nin one place.\n\u201cUse of Metric\nwill, in some\ncases, result in\na dangerous\nand highly\ndestructive\ndependency\u201d\nsocial pressure and a\nsort of excitement at\nexperiencing such illicit\npleasures for the first\ntime.

In this, the first edition of the new academic year, our\nmusic editors take you through some of their personal highlights (and lowlights) of the past few months\u2019 releases.\nMUSIC\nAdrian LaMoury\nMusic Editor\nAsad Raja\nMusic Editor\nHenry Eshbaugh\nMusic Editor\nThe third full-length\neffort by this indie pop\nquartet packs all the\nwholesome family-friend-ly goodness that fans have\ncome to expect, but not\nwithout a wicked sense\nof humour and a quirky,\nsci-fi inflected glaze. A\nnew crisply produced\nelectronic vibe replaces\ntheir traditionally gui-tar-led sound, but their\neminently off-kilter\nstyle is still recognisable\nbehind the spiralling\nsynths. The record serves\ntenacity and tenderness\nin equal measure, making\nfor an all round sublime\nexperience. They\u2019ll be\ncoming to London\u2019s Oval\nSpace in early October,\nwhich is sure to get some\nfeet stomping and hearts\nracing. - AL\nIf you\u2019re looking for\nsome stellar music from\nthe most undeniably\nharmless Beatle, stop\nreading now. Much of this\nalbum plays like an advert\nfor a waterproof camera.A\npretty young blonde leads\nyou through a crowded\nroom as someone back-flips off the roof, backed\nby the cheers and red cup\nraises of all those at the\npool party. You know the\nthing. Twee sing-alongs\nare interspersed with\noverproduced, bassy,\ndance tracks and, very\noccasionally, glimpses\nof brilliance. Age is just\na number \u2013 an arbitrary\nmetric perhaps, but one\nthat Paul McCartney\nhappens to be excelling in.\nDespite this, he earnestly\ntries to sound young and\nrelatable which, for the\nmost part, is endearing but\nsadly all too often comes\noff as vacuous. At its\nworst it\u2019s plain creepy (\u201cI\njust wanna fuh you\u201d).The\noverall tone, however,\nis one of positivity. But\nI guess optimism isn\u2019t\nreally the millennial way.\nThe last few tracks bang\ntho. - AL\n\u201ca montage\nof sounds,\nsamples,\nrefrains and\nreferences\u201d\nBROCKHAMPTON\u2019s\nexplosion of fame off the\nback of last year\u2019s Saturation trilogy coupled with\nthe understandable trauma\nof the whole Ameer situation has clearly weighed\non them. This communal\nstress lends a certain\ncohesion to the themes\nexplored on this new effort\n(it gets deep(er)) as well\nas a certain meticulous\nand often spectacular dar-ingness in sound derived\nfrom a fuck-giving-fatigue\n(\u2018TAPE\u2019, \u2018WEIGHT\u2019 and\nthe outro on \u2018DISTRICT\u2019\nare particularly beautiful).\nNevertheless, the theme\nof fame-induced depression teeters on repetitive\nat times, and a handful of\nsongs or moments sound\nturbulent to the point of\njarring or disorientating.\nTake \u2018HONEY\u2019 for\nexample. The yo-yoing\nbass spliced with sound\neffects and weird, low\npitched \u201cuhuh-uhuh\u201d\nvocals is fine, but the\nswitch up, though pretty\nat first, ends up feeling\nfrustratingly suspended\nmid-metamorphasis. Joba\ngoes ham throughout the\nalbum though. - AR\nOn his last album,\nFreetown Sound, Blood\nOrange founded a formula\nto his sound that he clearly\nhas a natural inclination\ntowards. Accordingly,\nhe uses the same style\non Negro Swan, now\nfocusing in on black de-pressionandisolation.The\nstyle is hard to describe:\nit\u2019s a unique, delicate,\ninstrumentation-guided\nmontage of sounds,\nsamples, refrains and\nreferences that seeks to\ncollate vibes, leaving the\nlistener with a narrative\nexperience as nuanced,\nhonest and deliberate as a\nlong diary entry. Which is\nironic because, especially\non this album, we don\u2019t\nget many direct, divulging\nverses. Yet you never find\nyourself lost. - AR\nDeath Grips returned\nin late June. True to form,\nthe album was teased with\na picture of Shrek director\nAndrew Adamson in the\nstudio. And true to form,\nthe entire feature is \u201cI\u2019m\nin the studio working\nwith Death Grips on their\nnew album.\u201d The album,\nsporting track titles like\n\u2018Linda\u2019s in Custody\u2019 and\n\u2018Shitshow\u2019, is exactly\nwhat you\u2019d expect. It\u2019s a\nslightly poppier move for\nDeath Grips (if DG is ever\n\u2018poppy\u2019), but otherwise,\nit\u2019s par for the course; a\nparanoid-schizophrenic\nlandscape populated\nby MC Ride\u2019s frenetic\nscreaming and Zach Hill\u2019s\nmanic drum-spam. New\nterritory is DJ Swamp\u2019s\nscratching and Justin\nChancellor (of Tool fame)\nplaying bass. Overall,\nthe album felt somewhat\nunmotivated; along with\n2016\u2019s Bottomless Pit,\nthis gets stacked on the\nDG \u2018meh\u2019pile. If you like\nDeath Grips, you\u2019ll like\nthis album. Otherwise, eh,\ngo check out Exmilitary.\n- HE\nEverything Protomartyr touches turns to gold.\nSinger Joe Casey has\nzeroed in on a unique\nbrand of image-rich\nlyricism and half-singing,\nhalf-shouting baritone\ndelivery that is at once\nentirely individual and yet\nevocative of bygone punk\nrock eras. Combined with\nthe clashing dissonance\nof the rest of the band,\nthe reified post-punk\nsound has been revived\nand reshaped into a mood\nmore suitable for the\nRust Belt dystopia that\nis modern-day Detroit.\nThe band first broke into\nthe big-time with 2015\u2019s\nfantastic Agent Intellect\n(my very first Felix\nreview), and carried their\nmomentum with the criti-cally-acclaimed Relatives\nin Descent, which made\nmany a top-of-the-year list\nlast January. Protomartyr\nsound fresh and original\nas ever here, arguably\nsoaring to new highs on\nthe especially-fantastic\n\u2018Wheel of Fortune\u2019.

Let\u2019s get\nright into the details.\nThe event that was held\nin The Steve Jobs Theatre\nin the Apple Park campus\nwas highly anticipated,\nmainly because this was\nthe first opportunity for the\nworld to see where Apple\nwould take it\u2019s new generation of iPhones (starting\nfrom the iPhone X last\nyear) that are markedly\ndifferent in design than\niPhones 6 through 8.\nApple confirmed essentially everything that was\nleaked in the days leading\nup to the event \u2013 it introduced three new iPhone\nmodels: the XS, XS Max,\nand XR.\nThe XS comes with\na 5.8-inch Super Retina\nOLED display, while the\nXS Max bumps the screen\nup to 6.5-inch. Both have\nan new and improved\nIP68 waterproof rating\n(compared to the IP67\nrating of last year\u2019s\niPhone X), the new A12\nBionic chip that improves\nprocessing power and\ntouts the new \u201cneural\nengine\u201d, and is offered\nin configurations up to\n512 GB. It\u2019s got a 7MP\nfront-facing camera, a\n12MP dual main camera\nwith a new Smart HDR\nsensor to help prevent\nblurry photos during\naction shots and enhance\nlighting based on facial\nand subject mapping. You\ncan also adjust the depth\nof field after the photo\nhas been taken, which\nreminds me of the Lytro\n(RIP).\nCompared to the iPhone\nX, the XS and XS Max\nget up to 30 minutes and\none hour more in battery\nlife, respectively. The new\ndevices will support dual\nSIM and users can set up\nprimary and secondary\nnumbers to know specifically which of the two is\nbeing contacted.\nWhen it comes to price,\nthe iPhone XS will start at\n\u00a3999 and the XS Max will\nstart from \u00a31,099.\nThe iPhone line-up is\n\u201cThe home\nbutton is\nnow officially\ndead and new\ndevices going\nforward will\nstart using\nFace ID as the\nsecurity unlock\nsystem\u201d\nalso being expanded, with\na 6.1-inch LCD phone\ncalled the iPhone XR.\nApple says its screen,\nwhich is liquid retina,\nis the first edge-to-edge\nLCD handset available.\nLike the iPhone XS and\nXS Max it has the A12\nbionic chip, FaceID, and\nno home button. It has the\nsame TrueDepth Camera\non the front. However,\nthe XR only has a single\n12MP wide-angle camera\non its rear and it doesn\u2019t\nhave Force Touch.\nThe XR is being made\navailable in new colours\n\u2013 white, black, blue, coral\nand yellow. Apple is also\nmaking a Product RED\nversion of its phone.All of\nthe versions are made of\nan aluminium band with a\nglass rear. The iPhone XR\nis set to start at \u00a3749 and\ncome with three different\nstorage options: 64GB,\n128GB and 256GB.\nHowever, it\u2019ll only be\navailable for pre-order\non October 19 and start\nshipping on October 26.\nAlso leaked prior to the\nevent, the Apple Watch\nSeries 4 is official. Key\nimprovements include\na larger display, louder\nspeaker, slimmer body,\nand a red ring around the\ndigital crown instead of a\nsolid red circle from the\nSeries 3. The crown now\nhas haptic feedback, and\nthe device hardware uses\na new body that Apple\nsays improves cellular\nconnection. It uses a new\nS4 chip that should double\nthe processor speed, and a\nnew gyroscope sensor that\ncan detect falls and alert\nyour SOS contacts of an\naccident.\nImproving from\nwatchOS 4\u2019s heart rate\nspikes alerts, the new\nwatch will offer new\nhealth features that detect\nunusually low heart rate,\nirregular rhythm symptomatic of atrial fibrillation,\nand take electrocardio-grams. Users can measure\ntheir ECG by holding their\nfingertips to the digital\ncrown for 30 seconds.\nApple says the device is\ncleared by the FDA.\nThere are also a couple\nof new interactive watch\nfaces, such as a health-fo-cused one that is designed\nto help users through\nbreathing patterns for\nmeditation. The Apple\nWatch Series 4 starts at\n\u00a3399 for GPS, \u00a3499 for\ncellular, and preorders\nstarting on Friday, September 14th.\nWhile I personally am\nnot a fan of the clunky\nnaming of these new\nmodels, there\u2019s no doubt\nas to whether the new\niPhones will sell like\nhotcakes. They always do.\nTim Cook at Apple\u2019s Annual Launch// Digital First Media\n\u201cThe new\nApple Watch\nwill also offer\nnew health\nfeatures ...\nApple says\nthe device is\ncleared by the\nFDA.\u201d\n\n"

This is a\ndifficult university to get\ninto, and you\u2019ve done\ntremendously well getting\nthis far.\nThere are many benefits\nto studying at Imperial:\nit\u2019s a rich, prestigious\nLondon university with\na strong research culture\nand some of the world\u2019s\nleading academics.\nSome of the educational\nprovisions, such as the\nUndergraduate Research\nOpportunities Programme\n(UROP) and the Horizons\nProgramme, are either\ncompletely absent or far\nweaker elsewhere.\nUnfortunately, there are\nalso plenty of issues at our\nuniversity. Our student\nsatisfaction is among the\nlowest in the country,\nwhile our counselling\nservice is so severely\nunderfunded that some\nstudents have had to wait\nover 15 weeks before they\ncan be seen. Other student\nservices, including the\ncooked breakfast in the\nSenior Common Room\nand the swimming pool at\nSt Mary\u2019s hospital, have\nbeen cut, while the membership cost at Ethos Gym\nhas been hiked up. At the\nsame time, Imperial runs\na huge surplus, exceeding\n\u00a378m every year for the\npast five.\nI don\u2019t say any of this to\ndemoralise you, but rather\nto make a point: we can\ndo something about this.\nVery often, we feel powerless when faced with\nissues, whether within our\ndepartments or across the\nuniversity. You probably\nnoticed problems at your\nschool or college that\nyou had no power to\nimprove, but university is\ndifferent. Students can be,\nand should be, more than\npassengers in their own\neducation.\nThere are so many\nways you can get involved\nbeyond your studies. You\ncan join a club and help\nfoster a sense of com-munity. You can work\nwith your department\u2019s\nsociety and get involved\nwith activities and events\noutside your course. You\ncan also run for election\nas a rep (nominations\nopen September 29th)\nand represent your fellow\nstudents on the issues that\nmatter to you most. The\nlast of these can often\nseem daunting and point-less, but they can result in\nreal, tangible changes for\nstudents. As an academic\nrep, I was able to introduce undergraduate\nteaching assistants to lab\nand computing sessions\nin my department, in\naddition to the existing\npostgraduate demonstra-tors. This means fourth\nyear students now have\nthe chance to earn over\n\u00a314/hour and freshers\nhave more support. That\nyear we also pushed the\nuniversity into ending its\nzero-tolerance policy on\nlate coursework, wherein\nwork submitted even a\nminute late would result\nin a student losing all the\nmarks for that assignment.\nRather more excitingly,\na rep in Physics was\nrecently able to organise\na Pizza Vending machine\nfor students, which should\nbe arriving on campus\nsoon. Students also made\na huge difference during\nthe nationwide pensions\ndispute earlier this year,\nwhere our support for\nacademic and support\nstaff helped strengthen\ntheir action, and eventually helped force Imperial\u2019s\nSciences) which currently\ndo not have common\nrooms. In addition, we\u2019d\nlike to see wide-reaching\nacademic decisions that\naffect all of us being made\nmore by students and\nacademic staff, and less\nby senior management.\nFinally (for now), in line\nwith other London uni-versities, we will also be\npushing the student union\nto start paying its bar staff\nthe London Living Wage.\nThese are my priorities,\nbut they needn\u2019t be yours.\nWhatever you want to do\nat Imperial, you owe it to\nyourself to be more than\njust a passenger. Whether\nthere are issues in how\nwe\u2019re being taught, in\nevents that are being run,\nor just in the vending\nmachines, rather than\nthinking \u201cthis sucks! I\nwish things were better,\u201d\nCampus life can get busy... get involved! // Imperial College London\n\u201cBe the change\nyou want to\nsee at Imperial.\nWe have the\npower to make\nit a better\nplace\u201d\nmanagement to compro-mise.\nThese kinds of achievements might seem out of\nreach \u2013 that they\u2019re too\nambitious or require some\nspecial knowledge or\nability, but they don\u2019t. All\nthat\u2019s needed is the belief\nthat things can change,\nand the motivation to see\nit through.\nThis year we \u2013 myself\nand likeminded people in\ntheUnion\u2013willbefighting\nback on the cynical cuts to\nstudent services discussed\npreviously. We will also\nbe working on improving\nstudent space, with a\nparticular focus on those\ndepartments (such as Life\nI believe our refrain\nshould be \u201cwhat can we\ndo to change this?\u201d We\nhave the power to make\nImperial a better place; if\nwe truly want to, we can\nwork together to make it\nhappen.\n\n"

    "content": "Get involved with sport at Imperial!\nWith over 60 clubs, you\u2019ll be sure to find the right sport for you!\nSPORTS\nImraj Singh\nSports Editor\nS\nport has been for\nmyself, and many\nof my friends, an\nintegral part of\nuniversity life. Being at\nuniversity can be stressful\nnot only because of academic pressure, but also\nbecause of moving away\nfrom home, dealing with\nfinances, making new\nfriends and stresses from\nhome, as well as being\npushed outside of your\ncomfort zone daily. Sports\ncan help to alleviate this\nstress as well as give you\na sense of belonging and\nachievement. Different\nsports offer different\npositives at different\ncommitment levels and\n\u201c...\u2018Give it a Go\u2019\nsessions... are\nput on by clubs\nto give a taste\nof what the\nclub can offer.\u201d\nAlexa, give me a picture of sport// Pexels\nFRIDAY, 28TH\nSEPTEMBER, 2018 FELIX\nSPORTS sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n48\nat Imperial there is a\nhuge range available to\nget involved in (over 60\nclubs), from more traditional rugby, netball and\nathletics to some you may\ntimed stops at each sport\nclub stall. Implementation\nof finance algorithms\nwithin Excel is necessary\nto ensure that your budget\ncan withstand sport\u2019s\nmembership, match fees,\ntour, networking events,\ntransportation, and personalised garments.\nIn honesty, my advice is\nto enjoy freshers week but\ndo try to take advantage of\nthe opportunities available around freshers\u2019 week.\nPersonally, I fumbled a\nthrough my first week in\na drunken stupor, missing\nmy American Football\u2019s\n(my chosen sport until\ninjury forced me to quit)\ntrial sessions. I regret not\nmaking more time for\n\u201cgive it a go\u201d sessions,\nwhich are put on by clubs\nto give a taste of what the\nclub can offer. I encourage you to try as many\nas possible. Imperial has\nsuch a vast range of sports\nthat I had never heard of\nprior to university. I\u2019ve\ntried American football,\nultimate frisbee, futsal,\nunderwater hockey,\nlacrosse and mountaineering to name a few, all of\nwhich have been very en-joyable, and everyone was\nvery welcoming. Many\nrecruits only pick up their\nsport in university. You\u2019ll\nbe sure to find the sport\nright for you.\nAs there are many\ndifferent sports there are\nmany venues too. Training\noccurs across west (near\nHeathrow) to more central\nLondon. With most sports\nthat are played on grass or\n3G, training is at Harlington or Heston. It is worth\nnoting that trips to-and-from Harlington are about\n2-3 hour round trip via\npublic transport from the\nmain campus. The cost in\ntime and money is sub-the cost. Indoor sports are\nmostly played at Ethos,\nImperial\u2019s sports hub, and\nrowing takes place at Imperial\u2019s own boathouse in\nPutney. Training sessions\ncan also take place in local\nparks (such as Hyde Park\nand Lillie Park), Union\nrooms, and non-imperial\ngyms. Imperial has two\ngyms, one in Ethos and\none in Reynolds building,\nboth with strength conditioning rooms that often\nhold sessions for sport\u2019s\nteams with qualified\ncoaches. Sports teams are\nalso split broadly between\nIC (Imperial College) and\nICSM (Imperial College\nSchool of Medicine).\nPick your allegiances\nas you wish.

    "content": "ISSUE 1698\nFELIX\n6\nPOLITICS felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMay, you live in interesting times\nAsBrexitdayloomscloser,theConservativepartyremainsdeepinturmoilonanissuethathas\nnot only paralyzed the government, but also the entire country.\nPOLITICS\nJuan Ignacio Rubio\nPolitics Writer\nI\nn 2015, David\nCameron achieved\nby surprise what no\nother Conservative\nleader had accomplished\nsince 1992: he returned to\nWestminster with a majority of six. The Tories had\nwarned the electorate of a\n\u2018coalition of chaos\u2019 arising around Ed Miliband\nif voters returned again a\nhung parliament. Three\nyears later, Labour isn\u2019t in\ngovernment, but the chaos\nis very much here.\nWe all know what\nhappened later. Brexit; a\npremiership that looked\nsolid but was badly\ndamaged by the supposedly useless Jeremy Corbyn\nin an ill thought snap\nelection; the deal with the\nright wing Democratic\nUnionists to maintain\npower, and the slow death\nby a thousand cuts of the\nMay government. We\nleft them last June with\nthe Brexit negotiations in\nstall, as the Tories were\ndeeply divided on the\nfuture relationship they\nwanted this country to\nhave with the European\nUnion: from the softest\nof Brexits advocated by\nbackbenchers like Anna\nSoubry and Dominic\nGrieve, to a clean cut\nbreakup with everything\nthat ties us to the European\ninstitutions, a position\nchampioned by the likes\nof Jacob Rees-Mogg\nand the remnants of the\nMonday Club.\nSince then, the\ntribulations inside the\nConservative party have\nbeen centred around the\nso-called Chequers plan,\nwhich was designed by\nMay as compromise\nbetween the two sides\npresented above, an\nagreement that the now\nunited Tories could sell to\nthe EU in order to achieve\nan orderly transition and a\nnegotiated exit. Needless\nto say, it proved fruitless.\nThe EU could never\naccept a deal that curtails\none of the freedoms (that\nof movement) almost\ncompletely, while schem-ingly retaining the other\nthree to variable degrees.\nIndeed, the heads of gov-ernmentoftheEUmember\ncountries told May quite\nbluntly that the plan was\nunworkable a week ago.\nOn the other side, the hard\nBrexiteers in Parliament\nsaw the concessions in\ntrade and justice issues as\na step too far and refused\nto stand by the document.\nThe problem for May was\nthat among the Tories\nthat saw the proposed\nagreement as treason to\nBrexit voters was her\nmain negotiator with the\nEU, Secretary of State\nfor Exiting the European\nUnion David Davis, who\npromptly resigned citing\nthat the UK was yielding\n\u2018too much, too easily\u2019 and\nstating that he couldn\u2019t\ndefend those proposals in\ngood faith at the negotiating table. Sensing blood\nin the water, Foreign\nSecretary Boris Johnson\nalso announced his resignation soon after that of\nhis colleague, sinking the\ncabinet into disarray.\nJohnson has been\nseeking the top position\nfor years, and his latest\ntactic in a long history of\npolitical zig-zagging is\ndrifting hard to the right to\nseduce the most extremist\nwing of the party, in the\nhopes of toppling May\nonce and for all. Soon\nNonetheless, Johnson\nshould be wary of other\npretenders to the keys of\nNumber 10. This summer\nseveral candidates have\nbeen rumoured as May\u2019s\npossible successor. The\nmost talked names have\nbeen those of the new\nForeign Secretary, Jeremy\nHunt, who is known for\nleading the Department\nof Health during the\nausterity driven Cameron\nyears, and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, a\nrising star among the Conservative ranks who has\nbeen frequently compared\nto Frank Underwood, the\nMachiavellian character\nplayed by Kevin Spacey in\nNetflix\u2019s House of Cards.\nAs the party grandees head\nto Birmingham for their\nyearly conference, May\u2019s\nposition looks shakier\nthan ever. In addition to\nhaving to fight against a\nLabour party that has been\nreinvigorated after its own\nconference, Chequers is\neffectively dead, no matter\nwhat her loyalists say, and\nthe post conference period\nis predicted to be a race to\nthe top as the different aspirants scramble to claim\nthe unofficial position of\nMay\u2019s heir presumptive.\nIndeed, by this time next\nmonth we may very well\nhave someone else as the\nleader of Her Majesty\u2019s\nGovernment. These are,\nindeed, turbulent times for\nthe Tories.\nKeep your friends close but your enemies closer// Flickr\n\u201cJohnson\nshould be\nwary of other\npretenders\nto the keys of\nNumber 10\u201d\nafter quitting his cabinet\nposition, he caused controversy by weighting\ninto the burqa debate with\nhis characteristic tact by\ncomparing women that\nwear the clothing to \u2018bank\nrobbers\u2019 that look like\n\u2018letter boxes\u2019. He was\ncondemned by May and\nother senior members of\nthe Conservative party,\nbut it could arguably be\nsaid that he did not receive\nenough criticism from the\nmedia. He cunningly dis-activated them by offering\ntea to the reporters that\nwere waiting at his garden\nfor an explanation, while\ndressed in a carefully\ncrafted casual attire. The\nrow slowly died off as\nJohnson continues to plot\nagainst his party boss.\n\u201cThree years\nlater, Labour\nisn\u2019t in\ngovernment,\nbut the chaos\nis very much\nhere\u201d\n\n"

Students can\nfeasibly roll out of bed\nwith five minutes to spare\nand still turn up in time for\nlectures. Needless to say,\nthis almost never happens\nand instead most Beit Hall\nresidents appear at least\n10 minutes late, wrapped\nin a duvet and rubbing\nsleep from their eyes.\nEastside Halls and\nSouthside Halls\nAn Eastside student\nwas recently witnessed\nsurreptitiously carrying a\ncarafe of caviar, wiping\nblood off their Versace\nslippers, having kicked\na commuter on the Piccadilly line for getting\nto close to their shoes.\nThey passed a Southside\nstudent with a chalice of\nChampagne. A violent\ndisplay ensued when the\nEastsider got caviar on\nthe Southsiders original\nYeezys. They were last\nwitnessed prodding one\nanother\u2019s butlers to fight\nwhilst screaming, \u201ckill,\nkill, kill.\u201d\nParsons House\nParsons House is an\nattractive option for many\nstudents due to its excellent amenities. There is a\nshopping centre, excellent\ntravel links to the rest of\nLondon, and plenty of\nmedics around to look\nafter you should you\ninjure yourself on the way\nback from sports night...\nPembridge Hall\nPembridge hall is\nessentially student battery\nfarming. There are 96\nbeds to two kitchens. For\nthose of you studying\nbiology, that\u2019s 48 students\nper kitchen. In the jungle\nof Pembridge, only the\nstrongest 8 students may\nuse the hobs at a time,\nleaving the rest to furtively scurry about after the\nresultant scraps. Speaking\nto a survivor, they claimed\nthat the experience made\nthem stronger, despite the\nobvious growth defects.\nPutney Boathouse\nUnfortunately, due to\nthe extremely broad nature\nof the students living at\nPutney boathouse, outlines of previous residents\ncan be seen in all of the\ndoorways. In order to\navoid damaging the boat-house further, it is recommended that students\nwalk around sideways, to\navoid additional drafts.\nWilson House\nUnfortunately, there\nare no solicitors studying\nat Imperial. Soliciting\nin general can be found\ncommonly outside Wilson\nat around three in the\nmorning. Students are\nadvised not to seek legal\nadvice from this source.\nSee a doctor instead.\nWoodward Buildings\nCostume Store\nAccording to other Imperial students, occupants\nof Woodward and the\nCostume store live so far\naway so as to be totally\ninaccessible. Residents\nof Woodward and the\nCostume store report\nbeing treated like social\nlepers by residents of\nSouthside Halls // Imperial College London\nother halls. One resident\nsaid \u201cI don\u2019t understand\nit, I thought that the\n40-minute commute on\nthe overcrowded Central\nLine in temperatures\nhigh enough to kill cows\nwouldn\u2019t be a barrier to\nour friendship.\u201d\nXenia\nXenia has Woodward to\nthank that it is not the furthest away from univer-sity. Unfortunately, there\nis little much else to say\nabout students at Xenia.\nOne student reported, \u201cI\nmet someone from Xenia\nonce, but I don\u2019t remember their face. Just a sort\nof grey mush.\u201d\n\n"

The campaign will position bright\nand eye-catching clothes\nbanks in busy shopping\nlocations around London\nto make them particularly\naccessible for young\nfashion lovers.\nHannah Carter from\n#LoveNotLandfill says,\n\u201cWe want people to stop\nthrowing clothes away\nand pass them on instead\nto slow down the pace of\nfast fashion. We\u2019re not\ntelling them to stop loving\nfashion. We want them to\nenjoy their outfits but then\ndispose of clothes careful-ly, because all items have\na second hand value.\u201d\nAt Freshers' Fair, Felix\nwill be offering one lucky\nfresher the chance to win\na custom tote bag designed by Bambi! Bambi\nshot to notoriety when she\ncreated a controversial\nmural of Theresa May and\nDonald Trump dancing\ntogether, called \u2018Lie Lie\nLand\u2019. She has created a\nstriking image of a young\ngirl holding up a dress\nwith disdain! This image\nhas been sprayed onto a\nlimited number of banks\nplaced in TopShop\u2019s\nOxford Circus store,\nBeyond Retro in Dalston\nand Ealing Broadway\nShopping Centre, plus\ntwo more coming later in\nSeptember in Westfield\u2019s\nshopping centres in Shepherd\u2019s Bush and Stratford.\nThe image is Bambi\u2019s\ncharacteristically tongue-in-cheek way of encouraging young people to use\nthe clothes banks.\nWhen it comes to\nfashion, young Brits love\nto shop. Each week, they\nbuy approx. 4.1 million\nitems of clothing to stay\nup to date with the latest\ntrends. However, whilst\nthey grow ever more\nstylish, the flip side sees\na massive 35 million\nfast fashion items end\nup in landfill each year.\nThe #LoveNotLandfill\ncampaign recently commissioned a nationwide\npoll to better understand\nthe attitude of 16-24 year\nolds towards clothing dis-posal. The results prove\nthat more must be done\nto help them change their\nrecycling habits.\nThe majority do not\nrealise they can put\ndamaged/stained/faded\nclothes into clothes banks,\nall of which can be recycled for industrial use.\nA massive 63% of under\n24 year olds said they\nwere unaware you could\ndonate stained clothes and\n40% do not recycle faded\nitems.\nBambi says, \u201cI think\npeople will be shocked\nhow many clothes end up\nin landfill\u2026. Someone\nelse may love the clothes\nyou no longer want.\u201d\nThe poll also uncovered\na general misconception\nof what clothing items\ncan go into a clothes\nbank. For instance, 70%\nof respondents assumed\nbras would be unwanted,\nwhen in actual fact they\nhave a high resale value in\nmany of the international\ndestinations that UK\nclothes are sold to, such\nas Africa and Eastern\nEurope. The same goes\nfor fancy dress.\nThe #LoveNotLandfill\nclothing banks will be in\nplace for a minimum of\nsix months to Jan 2019.\nAdditional #LoveNot-Landfill clothes banks\nwill be popping up around\nLondon over the coming\nmonths.

Brett Kavanaugh,\npotential appointee to the\nSupreme Court of the\nUnited States, has had\na rough few weeks. The\nmedia circus was brewing\nover (possible gambling)\ndebts paid off by shady\ncampaign-finance groups\nto the tune of $150k and\nnon-answers to basic\nlegal questions about\nprecedent-laden cases,\nand he had a peculiarly\nZuckerbergesque imitation of human behavior\nthat just kinda put people\noff; we like our lizards\nwith scales unvarnished\nby having your daughter\u2019s softball team in the\nfucking room during your\nnomination hearing. We\nwere primed for Kav to\nbe squirted along like so\nmuch impacted stool -motility, that\u2019s the power\nof ex-lax - then Feinstein\nshowed up.\nHere\u2019s a curveball:\nactivist judge for \u201cfamily\nvalues\u201d (i.e. fuck gay\npeople and women) turns\nout to be a nympho. Who\nraped people. Sorry, \u201callegedly,\u201d - that is, alleged\nby multiple credible and\ncorroborating witnesses\nbegging for the FBI investigation the Kavster seems\nto really not want - one\nunder threat of perjury.\nSorry, investigation? The\nelephants in the room\n(the Rs) declined to use\nthat Federal Bureau. And\nfor the record, the set of\nallegations keeps building\nand building.\nThe GOP knew about\nKav being a perv last\nweek. That\u2019s why didn\u2019t\nwant to go through with\nhim, and why Grassley\u2019s\nbeen such an ass to the\nunfortunate Dr Ford.\nUltimately, the fault lies\nat 1600 Penn Ave - Trump\nwanted him because it\u2019s\nan assured vote against\ncriminal prosecution,\npotentially allowing him\nto weather the storm of a\nconstitutional crisis with a\nstacked SCOTUS (recall\ntheir taking the nuclear\noption, evading conventional bipartisanship in\nthe process, to confirm\nGorsuch). Cretinous\nparasites they are, senate\nRepublicans coddled up\nto Trump and tried to\nram Kavanaugh through,\nfull-well knowing the\naccusations against him\nbefore news broke (for\nthe record, Ford\u2019s letter to\nDiane Feinstein goes back\nto July).\nIt started to look like\nthe Rs wouldn\u2019t get\nover the hump. Money-bomb funds arrayed\nagainst Sens. Collins and\nMurkowski if they vote\nup on Kavanaugh were\namassed for their next\nelections (how\u2019s that\nsound for Citizens United\nv. United States). Kav\u2019s\npolls started to suck more\n- lowest for any Supreme\nCourt nominee of recent\nmemory. The Dems finally\ngrew something approximating a spine, and it\nappeared that maybe, just\nmaybe, they could edge\nout this play and send him\npacking.\nNot so fast. Trump\nwould never pass up the\nopportunity to do something egregiously stupid.\nHere\u2019s the thing\nabout Ur-fascism: its\nproponents are dumb.\nReally dumb. Trump, as\nof Tuesday\u2019s writing, has\nabsolutely fucked it. He\u2019s\nof staff John Kelley.\nRosenstein again referred\nto the matter as fabri-cation. Trump\u2019s rumor\nmill churned, but nobody\nended up confused. We\u2019re\nin prime position for an\nimmaculate self-own.\nOh, and wasn\u2019t it\nsweet. Trump\u2019s Neanderthal staffers leaked to the\nmedia that the whole thing\nhad been a show staged\nto distract from the Kavanaugh hearing, hoping\nthe GOP could stuff\nKav through. And in the\nprocess, they put themselves in legal jeopardy\nfor a much clearer obstruction of justice case.\nWhat a fucking idiot.\nIf we were playing\nnormal politics, Trump\u2019s\nlaid all his cards and\ntried to put out a ten-alarm fire with a nuclear\nbomb. Amateur political\nHow does something so patently non-human get nominated for SCOTUS anyhow? // Lorie Shaull\n\u201cHere\u2019s the\nthing about\nUr-fascism: its\nproponents\nare dumb.\nReally dumb.\u201d\nleaking that in private\nconversations he \u201cdidn\u2019t\nlike Kavenaugh,\u201d oozing\naway with all the determination and presence of\nmind of a common garden\nslug fleeing salt. Rewind:\nhe tried to fire Rosenstein.\nIt didn\u2019t work. Rosenstein\ncalled his bluff. Trump\nblinked on Tuesday.\nRewind again. The slug\u2019s\nmulti-function orifice\nwheezed a noxious cloud\nin the process: rumors\ncirculated that Rosenstein\nwas going to resign.\nRosenstein rebuffed; the\nlie was doubled-down\non when the rumor\nwas \u201csubstantiated\u201d in\nconversation with chief\nmistakes coupled with\nbravado and sheer stupidity have led to an imminent\nconfrontation with the\ndeputy attorney general in\ncharge of a probe posing\nan existential threat to the\nadministration (as of the\nday before publication\n- ha, print deadlines).\nAs of publication, we\u2019ll\nhave seen whether Trump\nblinks a second time.\nKnowing Trump, he\nalmost assuredly will.\n\n"

This year,\nWind Band went further\nthan we\u2019ve ever ventured\nbefore, touring in the\n(mostly) sunny land of\nSlovenia.\nSlovenia\u2019s capital city,\nLjubljana, was a welcome\nsight for the poor souls\nwho volunteered to drive\nfor two days to get there.\nLuckily, it wasn\u2019t just\nbecause they\u2019d spent two\ndays in a sweaty minibus\n\u2013 it was a lovely sight for\nthe clever people who\ndecided to fly there, too.\nWe arrived at the hostel,\nunpacked our instruments\nand equipment into our\nrehearsal room, and got to\nexploring.\nLjubljana, we discov-ered, was originally a\nRoman city. It has all the\nobligatory ruins to go with\nit, mostly housed inside\ntheir city museum. It also\nhas a strong association\nwith dragons, specifically\na dragon that was slain\nin the Ljubljana marshes\nby Jason, of Argonautical\nfame. This means that\nvarious dragon-themed\ndecorations \u2013 bridges,\nstatues, plushies \u2013 are\npretty commonplace\nthroughout the city.\nLjubljana is a castle\ntown. The castle sits on\nthe top of a fairly steep\nhill, though exactly how\nsteep differed based on\nwhether you asked the\npeople who walked up the\nhill or the people who took\nthe funicular. The castle\nitself is medieval, with\na tall viewing tower that\ngave us splendid views of\nthe city and surrounding\narea. Some of us even\nattempted the castle\u2019s\n\u2018escape room\u2019, in which\nwe successfully saved the\nLjubljana dragon from the\nabyss beneath the castle.\nAside from the castle,\nand the impressive\nDragon Bridge over the\nLjubljanica river, we also\nadmired the Pre\u0161eren\nsquare, St. Nicholas\u2019s\nCathedral, and the oldest\nMcDonald\u2019s in Slovenia.\nOverall, we agreed that\nLjubljana was a pretty\nace city, especially when\naccounting for their tasty\nfood, ice cream, and \u20ac3\nbottles of rde\u010de vino.\nDespite all the sightsee-ing, we managed to fit in\nsome excellent rehearsal\ntime for the three concerts\nwe had lined up. Two of\nour concerts took place at\na bandstand in Congress\nSquare, a small park\nlocated in the city centre.\nWe played a selection of\nfilm themes including\nPirates of the Caribbean\nand The Incredibles, as\nwell as modern concert\nband tunes, all of which\nwere incredibly well-re-ceived. The rain during\nour second concert didn\u2019t\nperturb our devoted\naudience, simply prompting some listeners to sit\non the grass under their\numbrellas. Our final performance was cut slightly\nshort by a thunderstorm\npartway through Moment\nfor Morricone, scaring off\neven the most tenacious\nmembers of the audience.\nOverall, the reception at\nCongress Square was ex-cellent, and it was a lovely\nplace to play.\nOur third concert was\nat Bar Prul\u010dek, a cool\nlive music venue. Wind\nBand played fabulously\nthere too, albeit on a\nvery cramped and stuffy\nstage! The concert was\nlive-streamed out into the\nbeer garden where the bar\ncustomers enjoyed the\nmusic at a more bearable\ntemperature. After a short\ninterval, the Swing Band\n(a sub-group of our band)\nwowed the crowds with\nsome jazz classics, and\nhad more than a few onlookers tapping their feet.\nFinally, we took a day\noff to relax and visit the\nbeautiful Lake Bled. At\nonly an hour\u2019s bus ride\nfrom the city, Bled was\nabsolutely worth the visit.\nThe water was stunningly\nblue, and the sun shone\nall day long.

    "content": "U.S. Yield Curve Analysis\nA\nnew analysis\npredicts that the\nU.S. Treasury\ntwo-year bond\nyield is set to overcome\nthe U.S. Treasury ten-year\nbond yield between the\nbeginning of November\n2018 and the end of\nJanuary 2019 - most likely\nin December 2018.\nThis analysis suggests\nthat, with a 95% confidence interval using\nsimultaneous observation\nbounds, an inversion of\nthe U.S. yield curve is\nlikely to happen between\n31 Oct 2018 and 25 Jan\n2019 if the current trend is\nmaintained. The thinnest\nconfidence interval,\nusing non-simultaneous\nfunctional bands, predicts\nan inversion of the yield\ncurve between 09 Dec\n2018 and 17 Dec 2018.\nThe x-intercept is set for\n13 Dec 2018.\nThe U.S. yield curve\ncorresponds to the U.S.\nsovereign bonds\u2019 yields\nagainst their respective\nmaturity. A normal yield\ncurve shows that short-term bonds have lower\ninterest returns than\nlong-term bonds, while\nan inverted yield curve\nexposes the fact that\nshort-term bonds have\nhigher interest returns\nthan long-term bonds.\nYou can find below the\nfour possible bounds used\nfor this research. The blue\ndots represent the spread\nbetween the U.S. Treasury\nten-year and two-year\nbond yields, data courtesy\nof the St Louis U.S.\nFederal Reserve.\nThe fitting line was\nfound with a correlation\ncoefficient squared of\nr2=0.9234, this is adjusted\nto the degrees of freedom\ngenerated by the model.\nThe inversion intervals\nare given as follows\naccording to the different\nbounds: Note that these\nintervals work provided\nthat the trend since\nFebruary 2018 is holding\nuntil inversion.\nThe data also provides\nan average rate of change\nof the spread between the\nten-year and two-year\nyields, given at -0.58%\non a daily basis, proving\ninversion.\nSome argue that the\nquick inversion of the\nU.S. yield curve is due\nto the U.S. Treasury\u2019s\ndecision to stop extending\nthe weighted average\nmaturity of its issuance,\nthe anchoring effect of low\nlong-term global rates,\nand the ability for U.S.\ncorporations to currently\ndeduct pension contributions at the 2017 tax rate\nof 39% rather than the\nnew 20% tax rate, leading\nto a rush to buy long-dated\nbonds. Others believe that\nit is mainly due to the U.S.\ngovernment and corporate\ndebts which have reached\npeak levels of 2007.\nThe yield curve is a\npowerful indicator of U.S.\nrecessions, including the\nsubprime mortgage crisis\nin 2008-2009. Investors\nare more willing to switch\ntheir investment to risk-free assets since short-term bonds offer higher\nyields when the curve is\nflat or inverted. There has\nalways been a recession\nwithin 17 months following the inversion of\nthe U.S. yield curve - the\nmost significant being\nthe 2008 crisis as it was\nmade late due to the huge\ninsurance bond market\n(which products include\nthe Collateralised Debt\nObligations and Credit\nDefault Swaps) which\nwas 20 times bigger than\nthe underlying bond\nmarket.\nCommercial Cannabis: Bitcoin Bubble?\nO\nn Tuesday 18th\nS e p t e m b e r ,\nthe US Drug\nEnforcement\nAgency gave the\nCanadian cannabis producer Tilray permission\nto export its cannabis\nto the United States for\nmedical research. The\nnext day Tilray Inc. shares\nwere halted five times\nfrom trading in less than\none hour as the market\nneared its close. After\nbeing the first marijuana\ncompany to go public on\nthe NASDAQ Exchange\nearlier this year with an\nopening share price of\n$17, the company was\ntrading at a record high\nof $300 that Wednesday\n\u2013 a daily gain of 94%\nand an increase of more\nthan 400% in the past\nmonth! The company\nis now worth more than\na high number of large\ncap companies including\nAmerican Airlines and\npharmaceutical company\nMylan. The Vancouver\nbased company, according to its website, \u201cis a\nglobal leader in medical\ncannabis research,\ncultivation, processing\nand distribution\u201d.\nThis type of activity signals great investor expectation of future growth in\nthis lucrative industry. Even\nCoca-Cola is researching the\nmarket for cannabis-related\nproducts. ArcView Market\nResearch and its research\npartner BDS Analytics see\nthat over the next ten years\nthe legalisation of marijuana will see much progress\naround the world. Despite\nTilray\u2019s revenues of just\n$20 million in 2017 the upcoming legalisation of marijuana in Canada means its\nbusiness potential has dramatically increased. Additionally, consumer spending\non legal cannabis in North\nAmerica is expected to rise\nfrom $9.2 Billion in 2017 to\n$47.3 billion a decade lat-er. However, the worldwide\nrecreational cannabis market\nremains contained by the\nU.N.\u2019s Single Convention\non Narcotic Drugs. ArcView\nthink that not much can be\ndone to change U.N. attuides\nuntil the US Government\nfederally legalize the drug,\nwhich ArcView\u2019s CEO, Troy\nDayton, believes will happen\npotentially after the 2020\npresidential election. Nevertheless, there is still a huge\npotential market for medical\nuse of marijuana especially\nin Europe. With a health care\nspending budget of $1.3 tril-lion, European government\nsubsidised health care institutions can potentially bring\nthe medical cannabis market\nto become the largest in the\nworld (Italy is expected to\nhave $1.2 billion in sales by\n2027).\nDon\u2019t think though this is\nrisk free, investing in cannabis remains precarious. Tilray\u2019s recent market activity\nhas drawn comparisons to\nthe swings Bitcoin experienced at the end of 2017.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the supply and demand that drove Bitcoin up,\u201d\nJason Spatafora says, \u201cit\u2019s\njust limited supply and over\ndemand\u201d. Leslie Bocksorm,\nwho has invested in multiple\ncannabis companies, thinks\nthat from a fundamental financial perspective there is\nno justification for Tilray\u2019s\ncurrent valuation.

Arts editor\nClaire Chan gives you the lowdown on promming and what to expect for next year.\nARTS\nClaire Chan\nArts Editor\nT\nhe Proms\nconcerts are an\nannual tradition\ndating back to the\nlate 1800s, when open-air\n\u2018promenade concerts\u2019\nhad become popular in\nLondon\u2019s pleasure gar-dens. Rather than sitting\nstiffly down to listen\nto music, concertgoers\nwould stroll, or prome-nade, through the gardens\nwhile enjoying fresh air\nand the outdoors.\nBack then classical\nmusic had a bit of a\nreputation for stuffiness\nand inaccessibility that\nstill dogs the genre even\ntoday. Robert Newman,\nthe then-manager of the\nQueen\u2019s Hall, had the\nbright idea of offering\nindoor promenade tickets\nto the public, advertising\nlow ticket prices and an\ninformal atmosphere\nwhere eating, drinking\nand smoking would be\npermitted during the\nconcert.\nMuch has changed\nsince the inaugural Proms\nconcert in 1985. The\noriginal Queen\u2019s Hall\nwas destroyed during the\nLondon Blitz in 1941,\nwith the Royal Albert\nHall having served as\nthe venue for the Proms\never since. The BBC took\nover organisation and\ndirection of the Proms\nafter Newman\u2019s death in\n1927, adding new innovations such as lunchtime\nchamber concerts, Proms\nin the Park, and live broadcasting of every concert.\nAnd while the informal\natmosphere remains,\nsmoking is of course no\nlonger permitted during\nthe concerts!\nSo how does one join\nthe ranks of \u2018Prommers\u2019?\nThe Proms run every\nyear in summer from the\nsecond weekend of July\nto the second weekend\nof September. Over 1000\npromming spaces are\navailable for each concert\nand cannot be pre-booked,\nmeaning that promming is\nan excellent (and cheap)\nway to get tickets to\nconcerts which are otherwise sold out.\nTraditionally, the done\nthing is to queue for\ntickets outside the Royal\nAlbert Hall on the day\nitself. The \u00a36 promming\ntickets are given out from\n2 hours before the start of\na performance, although\nkeen concertgoers may\nstart queueing much\nearlier. Perhaps to save\npeople from dessicating\nin the heatwave, this year\n\u2018skip the queue\u2019 number\ncoupons were also given\nout from 9am on the\nmorning of the concert\nitself. This essentially\nholds your place in the\nqueue for later on in the\nevening; you just turn up\nwith your queue number\nand shove your way in\nfront of everyone else\nwho has a queue number\nafter yours. Worth it if\nonly for the resultant\nfeeling of smugness. For\nthose who would prefer to\navoid social interaction al-together, a limited number\nof online tickets are also\navailable from 9am on the\nday of the performance,\nwith an additional \u00a31.12\nbooking fee.\nRegardless of how\nyou get your tickets, the\nscene when you actually\narrive outside the Royal\nAlbert Hall is usually one\nof organised chaos. Lots\nof different queues at different doors (day tickets,\npre-purchased, gallery /\narena, season passes\u2026)\nand everyone apart from\nyou seems to know where\nthey\u2019re supposed to be\nstanding. Personally, I\ncouldn\u2019t figure out the\nlogic of the queues even\nafter my seventh time\ngoing, so it\u2019s best to ask\none of the stewards rather\nthan standing in the wrong\nline for half an hour.\nThere are two areas\nreserved for promming\nat the Royal Albert Hall:\nthe arena, on the ground\nfloor right in front of the\norchestra, and the gallery,\nlocated up in the gods\nnear the ceiling of the\nconcert hall. Which is\nbetter? Each has its own\ncharms \u2013 the arena has\nindubitably better sound\nquality, but is rather\nmore formal. Expect to\nstand for the entirety of\nthe evening; even if you\ntry to sit down, ushers\nwill come by and chivvy\nyou to stand up so that\nmore people can fit in at\nthe back. In contrast, the\ngallery is very far from\nthe orchestra and sound\ncan be a bit muffled, but\nit commands an excellent\nview of the stage. The\ngallery is also much less\nformal \u2013 people bring\ncushions, picnic mats and\neven inflatable mattresses\nto lie on. Anything goes\nreally as long as you\ndon\u2019t disturb your fellow\nconcert-goers by eating\ncrisps noisily during the\nwild melodrama of \u2018Night\non the Bare Mountain\u2019 (as\nhappened to yours truly).\nWhether at the arena or\ngallery, there is no dress\ncode for proms \u2013 wear\nwhatever you like!\nWhat can one expect\nout of a night at the\nProms? Despite its evolution over the years, the\nmain aim of the Proms is\nstill to make world-class\nclassical music accessible to all. Each night\u2019s\nprogramme is often\nthematically arranged,\nwith pre-show talks held\nat Imperial\u2019s very own\nUnion Bar. Expect the\nusual popular repertoire\nbut also contemporary\ncomposers and less-known works, a practice\nwhich dates back to when\nSir Henry Wood conducted the Proms in the early\n1900s. While the BBC\nSymphony Orchestra is\nthe main orchestra, a wide\nvariety of world-famous\nguest orchestras, soloists\nand conductors make\ntheir way through the\nRoyal Albert Hall for each\nyear\u2019s Proms. Highlights\nfrom this year include the\nBerlin Philharmonic conducted by Kirill Petrenko,\nand Seong-Jin Cho\nplaying Chopin\u2019s Second\nPiano Concerto.\nFinally, the Last Night\nof the Proms is always\na boisterous and wildly\npopular affair. It\u2019s been\ndescribed as \u201cclassical\nmusic\u2019s biggest party\u201d.\nThe atmosphere is festive;\nballoons and party\npoppers abound, as does\nmuch enthusiastic waving\nof Union Jacks. Regular\ntickets for the Last Night\nare allocated by ballot,\nwhile only prommers who\nhave gone for 5 or more\nshows in the season are\nable to get \u00a36 promming\ntickets for the Last Night.\nUsually a combination of\ncrowd-pleasing classics\nand British patriotic\npieces, it\u2019s always a night\nnot to be missed.\nAn evening at the\nProms is a magical expe-rience. Bring that special\nsomeone \u2013 or meet them\nin the ticket queue! This\nyear\u2019s season is sadly\nover, but it\u2019s definitely\nsomething to look out for\ncome next July.\nFull house: the crowd at the Proms // Royal Albert Hall\n\u201cOn the\nground or in\nthe gods? Each\nhas its own\ncharms\u201d\n\u201cBring that\nspecial\nsomeone \u2013 or\nmeet them\nin the ticket\nqueue!\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1698\nFELIX\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n14\nDoes reciting the Ten Commandments reduce cheating\nbehaviour?\n\u201cIt is unclear\nwhether moral\nreminders\ncan reduce\ndishonest acts\u201d\nFarewell summer,\nand welcome to a new\nacademic year! On the\nbright side, Halloween\nand Christmas are upon\nus, and you get to catch up\nwith all your friends. On\nthe downside, however,\nis the university-associ-ated stress: coursework,\npresentations and exam-inations. Even for the\npost-graduates amongst\nus, the amount of stress\nwe face upon assessments\nand deadline is tremendous \u2013 you either sacrifice\nsleep or your social life to\nmaintain your academics.\nNevertheless, there is\nalways a mischievous way\nto dodge the problem:\ncheating. While we all\nknow it is wrong, and\nthis article is by no means\npromoting cheating, one\nquestion had baffled\npsychologists around the\nglobe for years: why do\npeople do it?\nOnetheorybyLawrence\nKohlberg suggests that we\nestablish moral reasoning\nduring development. With\neducation, we would\nmature and gain a rational\nreasoning capability,\nwhich allows us to make\nthe right choice with a\nmorally-correct motive.\nOthers suggested that\ncheating is a choice, where\npeople would weigh out\nthe pros and cons of the\nact to determine whether\nto cheat or not. Other\npsychologists suggested\nthat the decision is not\nentirely by choice, as it\nis subconsciously influenced by the environment,\nwhere experiments had\nshown that people tend to\ncheat more in a darkened\nroom, as compared to a\nbrightly lit room. It has\nalso been suggested that\nbody posture can influence whether a person\nwould cheat: as a person\nwho assumes power poses\n(taking as much space as\nthey can) is more likely\nto cheat on a test or park\nillegally.\nUnderstanding why\npeople cheat can allow\nschool and universities\nto prevent cheating. It\nhad been shown that\nplacing mirrors within\nsight can alone lower\nrates of stealing in stores,\nas it serves as a tool\nfor self-reflection upon\ndoing the deed. In 2008,\na study even showed that\nwriting down the Ten\nCommandments prior to a\ntest can reduce the rate of\ncheating, whether you are\nreligious or not. All these\nsuggested that upon the\nreminder of moral rules,\npeople are less likely to\ncheat. In practice, perhaps\nthis is why students are\nrecited the rules and regulations prior to taking an\nexam.\nHowever, a recent\nstudy proved otherwise.\nIn a sample size of 4674\nparticipants across 19\nlabs, participants were\nasked to recite the Ten\nCommandments, or titles\nof 10 books that they\nrecently read, before\nconducting a series of reasoning tasks. At the end\nof the test, participants\nwould be asked how many\ntasks they accomplished.\nIf the experiments in\nthe past hold true, those\nthat memorised the Ten\nCommandments would\nhave a lower score than\nthe \u2018book-title\u2019 group,\nsince they should be less\nlikely to exaggerate how\nmany tasks they answered\ncorrectly.\nContrarily, the participants in the Ten\nCommandments group\nhad a higher prob-lem-solving rate than the\nother group, suggesting\na moral reminder is not\nuseful in preventing\ncheating. Nonetheless,\nother factors could have\naffected the results. For\none, the culture of the\nparticipants may influence the outcome, as the\nTen Commandments may\nnot activate participants\u2019\nmoral sense in some coun-tries. Furthermore, the\npresence of cameras may\naffect the level of honesty\nin the participants. Since\nit was proven in the past,\nthat the sense of being\nwatched can reduce dishonest acts \u2013 the environment can certainly have\nan effect on the outcome.\nOtherwise, the size of the\nsession may also impact\non the level of dishonesty.\nWhile the outcome of the\nexperiment is anonymous,\na larger group may give\na sense of security to the\nparticipants, where there\nis a less chance of others\ndiscovering they were\ndeceitful. As a result,\na smaller experiment\nsession may promote\nhonesty and vice versa.\nTo conclude, it is\nunclear whether moral\nreminders can reduce\ndishonest acts, so there\nis no rush to printing the\nBible verse and placing it\nin your significant others\u2019\nwallet, or taking it inside\nthe exam halls. The next\nlogical step from this\nstudy would be to collect\nmore empirical data to\nunravel the complexity\nof this problem, taking\ninto consideration of\ndifferent factors such as\nenvironment, ethnicity\nand upbringing, group\nsizes, and religious belief\ninto consideration when\nrepeating and validating a\nstudy like this.\nCheating is wrong, but tempting; are moral reminders enough to dissuade people? // Wikimedia\nSCIENCE\nSarah Wong\nScience Writer\n\u201cOne question\nhad baffled\npsychologists:\nwhy do people\ncheat?\u201d\n\n"

Or perhaps,\na young man who is aware\nthat your medication may\ncause cataracts in your\neyes, changes to the shape\nof your face, or your\nblood pressure to increase.\nHowever, not taking the\ndrug will mean that you\ncannot climb the stairs to\nyour attic, go for a swim\nwith your kids, socialise,\nor even work. This is the\nunfortunate dilemma for\nmany young people diagnosed with severe asthma,\nwhich affects around 1 in\n20 asthma patients world-wide; and is often treated\nby steroids such as prednisone \u2013 which results in\nnasty side effects.\nThe causes of severe\nasthma are not always\nknown, but in some\npatients, it is thought\nthat inflammation of the\nairways may be triggered by high levels of\na particular white blood\ncell called an eosinophil.\nA new class of drugs is\nnow being developed for\nthese patients, that may\nchange the way they are\ntreated \u2013 biologics. These\ndrugs target the underlying cellular changes\nwhich cause asthma,\neither by targeting immunoglobulins to combat\nallergic asthma, or by\ntargeting cytokines such\nas interleukins and thymic\nstromal lymphopoietin, to\nwork against eosinophilic\nasthma by lowering eosin-ophil levels.\nWith a range of new\nbiologics coming onto the\nmarket, this is an exciting\ntime for respiratory clinicians \u2013 if one biologic\ndoes not work for your\npatient, fear not \u2013 there\nare other options. Clinical\ntrials are still required to\nmake direct comparisons\nbetween these drugs as\nwe are uncertain which\nare more effective and in\nwhich patients \u2013 but what\nwe do know is that these\ndrugs offer a great deal of\nhope to patients who do\nnot respond to or cannot\ntolerate the side effects of\nstandard treatments such\nas steroids and beta-ago-nists.\nOne concern that has\nbeen raised is that eosinophils play a role fighting\ninfection caused by parasitic worms \u2013 so could\ndrugs that lower eosin-ophil levels increase infection rates in patients in\ntropical countries? We do\nnot yet have the evidence\nto show this, but it has\nbeen highlighted that this\npotential issue should be\nconsidered as these drugs\nbecome more widely\nused. Nevertheless, this\nremains an exciting time\nin the respiratory therapy\nfield, with biologics set\nto revolutionise the treatment landscape for severe\nasthma over the next 5\u201310\nyears.\nEosinophils in the blood may cause asthma // Wikimedia\nWe were born to be lazy\nR\ne s e a r c h e r s\nfrom the Brain\nB e h a v i o u r\nL a b o r a t o r y\ndesigned an experiment to\nunderstand why the couch\nattracts us so much more\nthan a good workout. The\ngroup led by Matthieu\nBoisgontier discovered\nthat the human brain\nmight innately prefer the\nlack of physical activity.\nThe human kind would\nnot have survived without\nenergy conservation\nmechanisms. We had to\nprioritise our basic needs:\nwater, food, shelter or re-production, so any unnecessary activity would lead\nto the waste of precious\nenergy. Boisgontier\u2019s\ngroup studied whether\nthis evolutionary adaptation could be blamed for\nthe fiasco of numerous\ncampaigns encouraging\nphysical activity.\nYoung adults participating in the experiment were\nasked to control an avatar\non a computer screen, by\nmoving it towards flashed\nsmall images representing\nphysical activity, and\naway from physical inac-tivity, as quickly as they\ncould. Later the task was\nreversed: the avatar had\nto move towards inactive\nimages, and away from\nactive ones. Throughout\nthe whole experiment\nresearchers measured the\nbrain activity of partici-pants.\nParticipants acted\nfaster in the first case,\nwhich confirmed the\nresults of previous studies\nconducted by the groups.\n\u201cThe exciting novelty of\nour study is that it shows\nthis faster avoidance of\nphysical inactivity comes\nat a cost - and that is an\nincreased involvement of\nbrain resources,\u201d Boisgontier reported. It might\nmean that our brains are\njust wired to keep us lazy!\nThe results explain\nwhy we struggle so much\nto choose jogging over\nNetflix. Can we change\nour brains preferences?\n\u201cAnything that happens\nautomatically is difficult\nto inhibit, even if you\nwant to, because you do\nnot know that it is happening,\u201d Boisgontier warned.\nBut he also reassured that\nawareness of this process\ncan help us act against our\ninnate laziness.\nSo, if you don\u2019t feel\nlike sweating today,\nremember: it\u2019s not your\nfault!\nMost of us would choose Netflix instead... // Pixabay\nDid you skip that gym session again? Blame evolution \u2013 it made us lazy, a new study from University of British\nColumbia indicates.\nSCIENCE\nPaulina Rowinska\nScience Writer\n\u201cThe human\nbrain might\ninnately\nprefer the lack\nof physical\nactivity\u201d\n\n"

The poems\nin this collection are anchored by this story,\nwhile weaving back and forth between East\nand West, past and present, art and memory.

It is not a leaning towards\u201cpost-truth\u201dor\n\u201cemotional states\u201d that drives increasingly warlike public discourse, but rather, it is that\nthe speed of knowledge and decision making has become more crucial, sidelining public\nagreement and expert opinion, instead making us rely on services that are fast.\nNervous States: How Feeling Took Over the World\nby William Davies\n\n"

I like the way\nthat sounds so I don\u2019t\ncorrect him. In truth, as\nfar as grime or UK rap\ngoes, I consider myself a\nsemi-casual listener (you\nwon\u2019t catch me listening\nto anyone less niche than,\nlike, Ghetts). Though I\nstay open to most genres,\nUS hip-hop is my forte,\nwhile indie rock, electronic and RnB always stay\nin heavy rotation. Top 5\nbands/artists? Probably\nsomething like Kanye,\nOutKast, Frank Ocean,\nRadiohead, The National.\n- AR\nDespite growing up\nlistening to Queen, Bowie\nand Duran Duran, my\nfirst album was Beautiful\nWorld by Take That, and\nmy first gig was Example.\nNot the greatest start, I\nadmit. For Christmas in\n2012 a friend of mine gave\nme three CDs he thought\nI\u2019d like: The Queen is\nDead by the Smiths,\nWhatever & Ever Amen\nby Ben Folds 5, and The\nVelvet Underground &\nNico by, funnily enough,\nthe Velvet Underground\nand Nico. It would be a\nclich\u00e9 to say they changed\nmy life, so instead I\u2019ll say\nthey rocked my fucking\nworld and I never looked\nback. - AL\nWhen I was five, I\nproudly learnt the words\nto \u201821 Seconds\u2019 by So\nSolid Crew, and when I\nwas six I was given my\nfirst album: Stripped by\nChristina Aguilera. I don\u2019t\nthink my musical tastes\nhave changed much,\nexcept for an angsty\nteen detour that had me\nexplore older English\nmusic and fall in love\nwith The Beatles, then\nDavid Bowie and finally\nThe Smiths as I made my\nway through the decades.\nNow, I just listen to Drake\nto be in my feelings. - SK\nAs much as I pretend\nto enjoy whatever\u2019s on,\nI only listen to drone,\nMongolian throat singing,\nand post-mariachi. I\u2019m\nnot like these normies.\nMy appreciation of music\nextends infinitely across\nthe imaginary span like\na Nyquist contour. One\ntime I heard a car crash and\nstopped dead in my tracks,\nstunned by the beauty of\nthe F#dim7add9minus17\nthe impact screeched out.\njk tho I only ever listen\nto Ke$ha. - HE\nGet the strap! 50 Cent storms O2 arena\nT\nhe crowd who\nturn out to see\nthe O2 arena stop\nof 50 Cent\u2019s Get\nRich or Die Tryin\u201915th\nanniversary tour is probably\nthe most diverse I have\never seen at a show. Aside\nfrom the Power theme\ntune or 50\u2019s Instagram\nfeed, I\u2019ve been largely\nout of touch with his\nwork for about a decade.\nDespite this, tracks from\nthis album: \u201821 Questions\u2019\nand \u2018If I Can\u2019t\u2019never stray\nfar from my most played,\nand few songs get a dance\nfloor filled quicker than\n\u2018In Da Club\u2019 or \u2018P.I.M.P.\u2019.\nGet Rich or Die Tryin\u2019\nis a classic \u2013 perhaps\nthe greatest album of all\ntime. You take what you\nwant from it \u2013 it has been\npraised as a damning\nexpos\u00e9 of gang life and\nculture, but also criticised\nfor including misogynistic lyrics and glorifying\nviolence. Since the album\nwas released in 2003, its\nfans have included those\nthat have misunderstood\nthe lyrics entirely. This includes me and my friends\nin the playground at seven\nyears old trying to work\nout where the \u2018Candy\nShop\u2019was. Whatever your\nperspective on the explicit\ncontent, it is difficult to\nargue against the impeccable production, flow and\nlyricism on the album, or\nits colossal legacy.\nThe show is a party\nright from the start. Lethal\nBizzleopensassupportact\nand gets eight moshpits on\nthe go within 10 minutes,\nand when 50 Cent makes\nhis entrance even those sat\nat the back of the stadium\nare stood up. 20,000\nstrong, the entire arena\nis heaving with energy.\n50 Cent is no exception,\nand any concerns he may\nbe too old for this finish\nbefore they have time to\nstart. It\u2019s a bit awkward\nwhen too many people\ndon\u2019t pause and instead\nscream the n-word at the\ntop of their lungs, but for\nthe most part the atmosphere is light hearted and\nfun despite the subject\nmatter. 50 wishes he could\nplay guitar like Prince. \u201cI\ncan\u2019t do that,\u201d he says,\n\u201cBut I can do this.\u201d, and\nlaunches into \u201821 Questions\u2019. There\u2019s little time\nto pause and chat \u2013 50\nhas so many hits he plays\nshortened versions of\nmost songs, only deviating from his work to play\nBob Marley\u2019s \u2018Is This\nLove\u2019 and encouraging\nthe audience to \u2018light up\u2019.\nThings take a sombre turn,\nhowever, when he halts\nthe show for a minute\u2019s\nsilence to honour the\nvictims of the Grenfell\nTower fire. The minute\nis touching, and the O2\nis illuminated with green\nstage lights and thousands\nupon thousands of phone\ntorches. He segues into\n\u2018Patiently Waiting\u2019, and\nthe bright spots begin to\nsway. I\u2019d be surprised if\nany of the audience got\nhome not feeling like\nthey\u2019d really enjoyed\nthemselves.

The club\nconverged on the barber\u2019s\nhaven (at least ten hairdressers were spotted\nin the small town) from\nacross the country and\nbeyond \u2013 members flew\nfrom Czechia, Tanzania\n& Hong Kong to make\nthe annual ICXCAC\nFollowing a run to\nscout out the local area\nupon arrival, the first big\ngroup activity was a trip\nto the local 5km parkrun\non Saturday morning. The\nclub\u2019s usual parkrun destination is at Fulham Palace\nwhich can tend to get\nrather congested on the 3\nlaps of Bishop\u2019s Park, so\nConwy\u2019s out-and-back\nroute was a welcome\nchange for the group\u2019s\nspot of parkrun tourism.\nAmazingly, 3 members\ndecided to run 20km to\nget to the start line of the\nweekly community run in\nConwy, whilst the remaining sensible members\nopted for the relatively\nshort minibus hop down\n\u201cThe game\nsaw all manner\nof atrocities\ncommitted;\nthe brutal\ncrushing of\na satsuma, a\nspatula used as\na toothbrush,\nand one calf of\nthe incoming\nclub captain\nmercilessly\nshaven.\u201d\nthe dual carriageway. Following a special shoutout\nand the usual spiel from\nthe race director, the\nrunners were away with\nImperial claiming seven\nof the top ten places and\nreceiving a good deal of\nsupport from locals and\nteammates alike along the\ncourse.\nWith their competitive\nappetite not suitably\nquenched, the squad\njourneyed back to their\nmansion for another prestigious event \u2013 the Great\nICXCAC Bake-Off.\nThe club\u2019s long tradition of offering copious\namounts of baked goods\nfor \u2018degustation\u2019 after the\nseason\u2019s races meant this\nwas equally important\ntraining for the year ahead.\nThe entries included a\nwide range of bakes,\nfrom Rice Krispy cakes to\nlavish vegan/gluten-free\ncreations.\nOutgoing women\u2019s\ncaptain and tour organiser Anna Lawson was\ncrowned star baker after\na Mentimeter poll was\nused to survey the expert\ntasters and despite strong\nindications of vote rigging\nand corruption (private\nbrowsers apparently allow\nyou to vote an unlimited\nnumber of times), the\nother competitors gracefully acknowledged the\ndeserving champion.\nThe evening\u2019s entertainment saw a game of\nthe children\u2019s birthday\nparty classic: pass-the-parcel. With \u2018challenges\u2019\nhidden within each layer\nof the mystery package,\nthe game saw all manner\nof atrocities committed;\nthe brutal crushing of a\nsatsuma, a spatula used\nas a toothbrush, and one\ncalf of the incoming\nclub captain mercilessly\nshaven. This was followed\nby karaoke into the early\nhours on the outrageously\nloud speaker provided\nin the large open-plan\nlounge.\nThe runners were\nrudely awoken the next\nday by an unpopular\nalarm of pan-banging,\nand eventually the squad\ndeparted for Snowdonia\nwith the aim of scoring\nas much elevation gain as\npossible. The group split\ninto various paces and\ndistances and remarkably\nmanaged to converge on\nthe car park where the\nminibuses were left with\nastonishing synchronicity,\nwith only one grazed knee\non the list of casualties.\nBefore long the week-enders (PhDs, employed\ngraduates, long summer\ninterns, and others with\nbetter things to do on\nweekdays) were back off\nto the capital.\nIn the following days\nthe itinerary was more\nrelaxed, with the remaining squad of around 20\ntaking a trip to the local\nzoo where they marvelled\nat large camels, gazed\nup at a well-concealed\nred panda, gaped at an\nenormous alligator, and\nwere abused by a red-faced monkey.\nDespite the local athletics track being closed for\nthe BBC Proms, the team\nwere hungry for some\nathletics, and so travelled\nto Wrexham athletics\ntrack on one of the days\nfor a mini-Olympics style\nset of events in which\nfour teams competed\nover 100m, 200m, 400m,\n800m, 1500m, shotput,\ndiscus, long jump, and\n4x100m relay. It was a\nhotly contested series with\nstrong potential to make\na return for the club\u2019s\nAthletics Taster Day on\nOctober 10th.\nThe most picturesque\nrun of the trip took place\non a visit to Llandudno\nwhere the team circumnavigated the headland\nin glorious sunshine with\nstunning views of the Isle\nof Anglesey.\nThe Club is already\nmaking plans to return to\nthe country of dragons,\nsheep, and daffodils with\na trail tour heading to\nImperial\u2019s Mountain Hut\nin Snowdonia for the first\nweekend of November.\nThere are also plans to\nhead a tiny bit further\nnorth before the end of\nOctober where the team\nwill be taking a minibus\nup to Manchester to enter\nthree teams in the university club\u2019s cross-country\nrelays.\nTo find out more about\nICXCAC, visit us at\nFreshers\u2019 Fair or email\nrun@ic.ac.uk.\nSquad goals // ICXCAC\npilgrimage to an entire\nweek of training away\nfrom London\u2019s polluted &\novercrowded pavements.\nThe majority of members\ntravelled on two minibuses from South Kensington, but others travelled\nLeaving their mark on a Welsh beach // ICXCAC\nby car, train and plane to\nreach the Welsh vista.\nThe purpose of the\nweek was to begin to\nrebuild fitness after a lazy\nsummer spent abroad, at\nhome, or in a stuffy office\nserving time at various\ninternships. Other aspects\nof the tour focused on\nteam-building, and just\na little bit of relaxation\nwith the team making\namble use of the house\u2019s\nentertainment facilities\nincluding a home-cinema,\na surprisingly bass-y\nspeaker, and various\ntable-top games including\ntable football, pool, and\ntable tennis.\n*wettest\nImperial\u2019s largest sports club visited North Wales for this summer\u2019s hottest* tour\n\n"

This change comes\namongst a slew of recent\nchanges to the Commercial Services offered\non campus, including\nchanges to the cost of\naccess to Imperial's sports\ncentre, Ethos (as reported\nby Felix in July).\nThe Union breakfast\nmenu is divided into\ntwo sections, a \u201cGrab\n& Go\u201d menu and a \u201cSit\n& Graze\u201d menu. As\nthe name suggests, the\n\u201cGrab & Go\u201d menu is\nintended for students\nwho want to \u201cgrab some\nfood quickly before they\ngo to lectures\u201d, while the\nSit & Graze menu allows\nfor those with spare time\nto \u201csit down\u2026 chat with\ntheir friends, socialise\u201d\nand more.\nThe whole menu is\navailable for anyone\nsitting down to eat, i.e.\nfood from the \u201cGrab and\nGo\u201d menu is still available to eat-in. However,\nanyone wanting to order\nfood to take away will\nonly be able to do so from\nthe \u201cGrab & Go\u201d menu.\nFelix caught up with\nClaudia Carabello, the\nDeputy President (Fi-nancial Services), who\nexplained the Union\u2019s\ndecision to start offering\nbreakfast:\n\u201cWe started breakfast\nbecause SCR stopped\nbreakfast; that was a\nCollege decision\u2026 it was\nmaking a big loss, yet\nstudents really wanted\n11.30 am and \u201cGrab &\nGo\u201d items available from\n8 am to 11.30.am.

But\nas Aesop\u2019s tale of the boy\nwho cried wolf reminds\nus, it is ultimately dangerous and counterproductive\nin cheapening the accusation of anti-Semitism.\nThe most successful\nBritish Jewish politician\nin recent times has been\nEd Miliband, the former\nleader of the Labour\nParty. Before him, it\nwas his brother David\nMiliband the former foreign secretary in a Labour\nGovernment. Of course,\nthere are fringes within\nthe Labour movement\nwho are anti-Semites\n\u2013 with individuals who\nfixate all their attention\non the human rights violations by Israeli state (and\nblame Israeli citizens for\nthe actions of their gov-ernment) whilst ignoring\nthe far more numerous\ncrimes of other countries\nin that neighbourhood.\nBut the claims made by\nsome Blairite MPs of\nwidespread anti-Semitism\nwithin the rank and file of\nthe labour party is nothing\nmore than an attempted\npropaganda campaign\nto protect themselves\nfrom deselection and\nto overthrow Jeremy\nCorbyn.\nLet us be clear, the\nLabour party has accepted\nthe full International\nHolocaust Remembrance\nAlliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism and\nseven out of the eleven\nillustrations. The entire\nclaim of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s\nsupposed anti-Semitism\nrests on the partial rejection of these four named\nexamples, thus it\u2019s paramount for the other side of\nthe argument to be heard\nwithout being labelled an\nanti-Semite.\nNow this is not to say\nthat the Labour leadership\nhas not muddled a political\nsoft-ball and exasperated\nthe issue unnecessarily. Of\nthe four initially rejected\nexamples, three of which\nshould have easily been\naccepted:\n1. Accusing Jewish\ncitizens of being more\nloyal to Israel, or to the\nalleged priorities of Jews\nworldwide, than to the\ninterests of their own\nnations.\n2. Applying double\nstandards to Israel by\nrequiring of it a behaviour\nnot expected or demanded\nof any other democratic\nnation\n3. Drawing comparisons of contemporary\nIsraeli policy to that of the\nNazis.\nThesepoliticalmistakes\nshould not be confused\nwith anti-Semitism, as\nthey are centred on the\nnation state of Israel, and\nnot on the Jewish religion.\nJust as having a dispropor-tional amount of criticism\nof Saudi Arabia does not\nmake one an Islamophobia\nnor does claiming British\nHindus have a greater\nloyalty to India make one\nanti-Hindu. However, it is\nimportant for the Labour\nleadership to look beyond\nits own intentions and\nunderstand the very legitimate fears of British Jews.\nComparing Israel with the\nNazis is deeply moronic,\nand accusing British Jews\nof being more loyal to\nIsrael is deeply misguid-ed. The national executive\ncommittee (NEC) was\nright in later accepting\nthese examples on September 4th. However, it is\nunfortunate that in a rush\nto resolve this PR disaster,\nthe Labour party abandoned its initially rightful\nopposition to the notion\nthat claiming that the existence of a State of Israel\nis a racist endeavour is an\nexample of anti-Semitism\nand contradicts the right\nof Jewish people to their\nself determination.\nThe Labour party was\ninitially right in recognising that by adopting this\nnoted example it would\nstifle criticism of the state\nof Israel. Were Mahatma\nGandhiorNelsonMandela\nanti-Semites for opposing\nthe forcible seizure and\nexpulsion of Palestinians\nform their native lands\nbecause of a colonial fiat?\nArthur Balfour, speaking\nfor one country promised\nthe land of another\ncountry to another people.\nIn the original 1948 UN\npartition plan, the Jewish\nstate received 56% of the\nland mass of Mandatory\nPalestine whilst Jews\nmade up less than 32%\nof the population. Opposition to the UN partition\nplan and the succeeding\nland grabs by Israel\nbecause of war outcomes,\nas espoused by the likes\nof Noam Chomsky is\nnot rooted in anti-Sem-itism but against racial\ncolonialism. And this in\nnot merely a historical\ndebate, but very relevant\nin today\u2019s politics in Israel\n\u2013 with the passage of the\ncontroversial \u2018Jewish-nation state law\u2019 in July\nwhich in effect rendered\nArab Israeli citizens to\nsecond-class citizenship.\nBy not recognising\nthe deep-rooted racial\nprejudice in Israel\u2019s foundation \u2013 it minimises the\nstruggles and pains of the\nPalestinian people. Thus,\nit is a pity that the Labour\nParty has succumbed to\nthe onslaught of negative\nand unfair press coverage\nby abandoning its moral\nobjection in stifling debate\non Israel\u2019s racist policies.\nJeremy Corbyn has\nfought against racism\nall his life, from fighting\nagainst apartheid in the\n1970s and 80s to his\nhistoric commitment to\nthe Palestinian people\nwhich reflect the actions\nof a warrior against\nracism. Jeremy Corbyn\n(whose ideological heroes\nKarl Marx, Leon Trotsky\nand Rosa Luxemburg\nwere great historical\nJews) has always proudly\nstood shoulder to shoulder\nwith his Jewish socialist comrades like Jon\nLansman, the founder of\nMomentum.\nDame Margaret\nHodge\u2019s hyperbolic claim\nthat the Labour Party\u2019s\ndisciplinary process\nagainst her is reminiscent\nwith 1930s Nazi Germany\nbelittles the true horrors\nof the holocaust. And the\nopportunistic Frank Fields\nbogus claim that he left\nthe Labour party because\nof anti-Semitism doesn\u2019t\nhold its weight when one\nlooks at his historically\nxenophobic opposition to\nimmigration \u2013 this is not a\nchampion against racism\nbut a politician who was\nfacing deselection and\ntrying save face.\nFor thousands of years,\nJews have faced untold\nmisery and suffering,\nand it is absolutely right\n(and far overdue) that the\nLabour party disposes\nany anti-Semitic elements\nwithin the party to the\ndust-bins of history.\nHowever, it\u2019s vital that\ngreat Jewish faith not be\nreduced to a monolith,\nconsequently criticism of\nthe state of Israel not be\nconfused with anti-Semi-tism. Let us not confuse a\nsmall disgusting minority\nwith the overwhelmingly\nprogressive majority.\nJeremy Corbyn // Wikimedia\nISSUE 1698\nFELIX\n8\nPOLITICS felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

The Chequers\nplan was designed to be\na compromise between\nremain and leave supporters with regulatory agreement over goods allowing\nfrictionless trade whilst\nsolving the Irish border\nproblem, however; it has\nfailed to appeal to either\nside of the Brexit debate.\nWhilst Cabinet members\nJohnson and David Davis\nhave resigned over the\nChequers plan, this has so\nfar had few consequences\non Theresa May\u2019s Brexit\nplans and it is still the\nagreed position of the\nCabinet with both remain-ers and Brexiteers in her\nCabinet publicly backing\nthe plan.\nThis was as good as\nit would get for Theresa\nMay. She\u2019s been facing\nopen revolt over her\nplans from the European\nResearch Group, a group\nof Eurosceptic Conservative MPs, who believe\nthe deal would leave the\nUK in the worst possible\nposition on accepting\nEU rules on goods but\nunable to influence these\nrules after leaving the\nEU. This group would\nprefer to see the UK\nleave with a simple free\ntrade agreement where\nboth countries agree to\nreduce tariffs over goods,\nbut this could reduce\noverall trade with the EU\ncompared to the current\nsettlement. However, this\nwould make it easier to\nstrike new trade deals\nwith other countries such\nas the USA, which would\nbe much more difficult\nunder the Chequers plan.\nThe European Research\nGroup (ERG) is about\n40-60 MPs strong and\nwould in all likelihood be\nable to scupper any deal\nthat Theresa May brings\nback to Parliament that\neven vaguely resembles\nChequers if they were to\nvote against it. There are\nonly two ways Theresa\nMay could get her plan\nthrough Parliament; one\nwould be to appeal to a\nselect number of Labour\nMPs to vote for her plan\nin order to avoid leaving\nthe EU without a deal.\nThe other way to garner\nsupport is to turn any vote\non May\u2019s Brexit plans into\na vote of no confidence in\nher government. It would\nthen be a choice between\ntriggering a general\nelection where Corbyn\u2019s\nLabour could win power\nor vote for the deal.\nTheresa May\u2019s plans\nwere also dealt a heavy\nblow by the EU. They\nhave come out to say that\nthey believe her plan to\nbe unworkable and that\nit would undermine the\nintegrity of the EU single\nmarket. This was a much\nstronger rebuke to her\nplans than she had anticipated and provoked a\npointedly angry response\nfrom the PM. The\nEU\u2019s plans for the Irish\nbackstop have proved\nunpalatable to the UK\ngovernment as they would\nsee Northern Ireland enter\ninto a different arrangement so that there would\nbe no need for border\nchecks on the island of\nIreland. This would result\nin checks being made\nbetween Northern Ireland\nand the rest of the UK if\nthere were no deal and according to some would be\nthe economic annexation\nof Northern Ireland from\nthe rest of the UK; this\nwould most significantly\ninclude unionist DUP\nMPs who May relies on in\norder to gain a majority in\nParliament following her\nbotched general election\nof 2017.\nThe Labour party\u2019s\nposition on Brexit is as\ndivided as the Conservatives. In this way Labour\nare fortunate they do not\nhave to deliver Brexit\nas these divisions would\nbecome all the more\napparent under the kind of\nscrutiny any government\nwould face over Brexit.\nThis has been exemplified\nby the recent row over\noption to remain could be\none of the options on the\nballot paper but Labour\u2019s\nShadow Chancellor categorically ruling this out.\nLabour have spelled out\nsix tests which any Brexit\nplan must meet in order\nfor them to vote for it; one\nof these tests state that the\nUK should have the same\nbenefits after Brexit as we\ndo before it. This is clearly\nunachievable under any\nBrexit deal. Beyond these\nsix tests Labour has failed\nto give much more detail\nas to their Brexit plans\nand Labour\u2019s solution to\nBrexit thus far has been\nto be as ambiguous as\npossible on their Brexit\npolicy. With Brexit\nnearing and the Labour\nconference under way\nthis position will become\nharder and harder to\nmaintain.\nWhere we will be come\nMarch 2019 when we\nleave the EU is anyone\u2019s\nguess. If Theresa May is\nable to convince the EU,\nremainers and Brexiteers\nin Parliament to agree to\nher deal then this would\nbe bordering on mirac-ulous. Both Labour and\nthe Conservatives have\nbeen severely challenged\nby Brexit and how they\nmanage the next few\nmonths could shape the\nfuture of the UK for a\ngeneration.\nBrexit // Pixabay\n\u201cLabour\u2019s\nsolution to\nBrexit has\nbeen to be as\nambiguous as\npossible\u201d\na 2nd referendum. At\nthe Labour conference\nthere has been agreement\namongst the leadership\nthat if the membership\nvote to back a 2nd referendum then this will be\nadopted by the party. This\nscenario appears likely\nto happen. However, the\nnature of this 2nd referendum was disputed with\nLabour\u2019s shadow Brexit\nSecretary stating that an\nISSUE 1698\nFELIX\n7\nPOLITICS felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cEurosceptc\nTories would\nscupper any\ndeal that\nresembles\nChequers\u201d\n\n"
