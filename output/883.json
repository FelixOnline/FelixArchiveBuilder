    "content": "FELIX\nChris Riley reports on the feelings of Beijing students, one year after the event\nTiananmen: Riot or Massacre? FELIX\n'Beijing experienced a horrifying counterrevolutionary rebellion on June 3 and4,1989. The purpose of the rebellion was to\noverthrow the leadership of the Chinese\nCommunist Party and subvert the socialist\nPeople's Republic of China'.\nThis is how the official Chinese\ngovernment publication 'The Beijing\nRiot\u2014A Photo Record' opens its\nexplanation of the events which took\nplace last year.\nThe most offensive aspect of the\natrocities is the b latent denial by the\nauthorities that they ever occurred: the\nofficial version is that the massacre didn't happen. The propaganda continues...'A handful of rioters instigated innocent\npeople who were unaware of what was\ngoing on to intercept the martial law enforcement troops in an attempt to\nprevent them from advancing into\nTiananmen Square. They smashed or\nburned military vehicles and public\nbuses...and went as far as brutally\nmurdering PLA soldiers and armed\npolicemen.' 'During the rebellion more\nthan 6,000 officers and men of the\nmartial law troops, armed police and public security police were injured and several dozen were killed. Also, more\nthan 3,000 civilians were wounded and over 200 died, including 36 college\nstudents. Among the non-military\ncasualties were rioters who deserved the\npunishment, onlookers as well as doctors\nand other people killed and injured\naccidentally while carrying out various\nduties at the scene of the riot.'\nNo sooner had the blood been washed\noff the streets than the wave of witch\nhunts and executions began. Even now those caught speaking to a foreign\njournalist can be arrested for 'rumour-mongering'. A Japanese geologist whose\ncompany headquarters are six kilometres\nfrom the Square estimated that over\n100,000 people were executed in the area\nduring the crack-down which followed.\nIn July of this year I visited Beijing as a tourist to attempt to talk to students still\nstudying there.\nIt was already uncomfortably hot and close at 8.30am as I cycled north along\nBeichizi Dajie. The vastness of Tiananmen\nSquare on my left stretched into the smog\nand was thronged with Chinese tourists.\nAt the north of the square I turned right\nonto the wide Jingshan Qianjie and the\nfront wheel reached a series of ruts\nwhich shook the already rickety frame\nand caused the bell to ring. It was one of\na series of tank tracks fossilized in the\ntarmac as testament to the atrocity which\ntook place just over one year ago.\nBeijing is almost devoid of university\nstudents during the uncomfortable humid\nmonths of July and August, but a sprinkling of postgraduates can still be\nfound in their squalid, dingy halls of\nresidence. A surprising number are still\nTiananmen Square after the massacre.\nprepared to risk the little freedom they\nhave to speak about China's problems.\nChina is facing difficult times\neconomically, because of last June's movement.\nHas this put China back a long way?\nYes, somewhat, but I think it is only a temporary setback.\nThe Chinese system is still very\nunpopular worldwide, and this cannot\nbe helping to propel China towards a democracy.\nYes, it is easy to understand that\nWestern countries think the Chinese\nsystem is not right. We students have\ndiscussed this and we also understand\nChina very well. I think the attitude of\nthe West is wrong. The Chinese people\ncome from a different cultural\nbackground; a different system. We have\nhad some discussions together, fellow\nstudents and teachers and professors. We analysed the Chinese situation and the\nsystem, and agreed that no one can solve\nChina's problems. No matter who comes\nto control the government, they will still\nface the same problems. It is not going to\nchange quickly.\nThis year, especially in Europe,\nthere have been some very big\nchanges; the Berlin Wall came down\nwithin a few months last year.\nYes. The Chinese intellectuals were\nshocked by the rapid changes in\nEurope...but they realised that it is easier\nfor the Eastern European countries to\nchange.\nWhy is there this difference? Why was it possible for Romania to change\nalmost overnight and for Germany,\nEast and West to unite?\nIt is the difference in the cultural and\neducational background. People in\nEastern European countries have better\ndemocratic minds than the Chinese\npeople. They are surrounded by capitalist\ncountries and the people cannot avoid\ncontact with such countries. China only\nopened ten years ago. The people have\nonly just begun to experience the\nWestern world which they cannot\nunderstand.\nMany people still don't know what life\nis like in other countries. How do you\nexplain colours to a blind person? How can you ask Chinese people if they want\ndemocracy and a better kind of life, when they have nothing to make comparisons\nwith. The majority of people are simple\nfarmers, peasants who cannot\ncomprehend democracy. At present there\nis no education for them: even if they\ntried to understand they could not.\nEastern European people have a much higher level of education.\nBut last year it was the students\nwhich started the move towards\ndemocracy.\nYes...young intellectuals, this is also\nChinese tradition. It is easy for them to\nstart a revolution, but not easy for them\nto bring things to a conclusion; it has\nhappened before.\nThe locals still refer to the Square\nas 'The Crematorium'. Looking round\nTiananmen Square now, in my mind\nthe memories of the bloodshed have\nhardly faded, yet there are families\nphotographing their children, people\nflying kites and everyone seems\nhappy again. Are they really so\nhappy?\nIt's easy for Chinese people to accept\nthe facts. Most of the people, even the\nintellectuals, think that it is best for us to\naccept the situation now, it is no use to\nprotest.\nHow can you accept the massacre?\nThe Chinese government tried to\n...and one year later.\n'smooth' the people, providing food to\nconvince the people that they are happy\nand that things have not changed. Most\npeople are easily pleased and they just\nwant a peaceful daily life, like (I suppose)\nmost people in the West, not worrying\nabout what democracy and freedom are.\nBut still it is hard for us to imagine\nhow forgiving you can be and how\nyou seem to forget things so quickly.\nNo. In people's hearts they can never\nforgive such a thing. We will remember it\nfor life. If in the future an intellectual\nwrites history, this scandal will be\nremembered.\nDo you still feel bitter inside\nbecause of what they did?\nWe know that in the senior government\nthere are still conflicts. Running the\ngovernment is easier said than done.\nMany people went to the street to protest\nbut if you invited them to form a government they would not be able to\nchange anything. We know some of the\ndemocracy movement leaders, they are\nnot qualified politicians, they are simply\nintellectuals who are interested in politics.\nIt is simply not time to think of\ndemocracy and freedom. We still have\nold generations from the 'Long March';\nafter they die perhaps things will change.\nThis is the last generation; the next have\nreceived a different education. China as a country depends a lot on the governors'\nminds. We think of this as democracy.\nThe people are used to being led by a person, to have an example to follow. If\neducation doesn't improve this situation\nwill not change and democracy will not\nwork. If the students had changed things\nto a democracy the workers and peasants\nwould not have known how to react.\nBut last year some of the workers\nwere involved in the movement.\nIt is not because they think the same as\nthe students. Some workers and general\ncitizens came onto the streets out of\nsympathy for the students without\nknowing who to follow and without fully\nunderstanding the implications of the\nstudents' demands. The Chinese people\nare accustomed to think as the\ngovernment thinks and to believe what\nthe papers say.\nIsn't that why the changes last year\nwere so radical and alien to the\npeople because the students were\nthinking for themselves and going\nagainst what the government thought?\nDo you think radical changes will\never take place? What are your hopes\nfor China's future?\nSome people still have some hope, yes\nperhaps...but China is still a communist,\nsocialist country. We have to depend on our government for almost everything;\nour policies, our beliefs, our views. But\nnowadays the world is changing and China can no longer remain isolated. The government must face this and take new steps to develop the country. They have\ntried their best to compromise with\nWestern countries by helping them to\ninvest in China and only in this way can\nChina develop more quickly. Sanctions,\nwhich would starve Chinese people of\nbusiness, economic, cultural and political\ncontact, are not the answer. From a historical point of view China hasn't gone\nthrough the natural process of\ndevelopment that capitalist countries\nhave. Our economy and education are\nstill backward and in this situation it is\nvery difficult for us to change overnight\ninto a Western culture. We have become\nmore open since the economic revolution\nand it is easy to see we will have to face\na lot more problems especially in these\ninitial stages before companies are in\nprofit. The economic revolution is just\nlike the western evolution, but our system\nis different and there are bound to be\nsome conflicts between the people: some\nare not satisfied and try to protest. A few\nChinese became rich overnight while\nothers who worked in factories\nmaintained the same economic status.\nThis is not natural, and people have to\nshow their disagreement. Many young\npeople don't understand the enormity of\nthe problem.\n10 11\n\n"

    "content": "| ^ Montpelier Setback\nMontpelier Hall has been taken off the\nmarket for up to three months whilst\nlegal documents are scrutinised. Gordon\nMarshall, the new Director of Estates, said\nthat he had some queries over the\nwording of the contract drawn up by\nCluttons which, he thought, did not\n'maximise the benefits' for college.\nThe hall was to be sold in mid-December, after student's accommodation\ncontracts ran out on the 16th. Mr Marshall said that it would now be sold\nsometime after mid-February but that the\nsituation as regards students still had to\nbe 'sorted out'. He thought that students\nwould not want such a short contract but\nMiss O 'Callaghan, the Accommodation Officer, said that students who wanted to\nstay on until March could approach her.\nOn accommodation, Mr Marshall said\nthat there would be a document sent to\nall students detailing the state of affairs\nwith regards to Montpelier Hall and the\nClayponds estate. Rather than directly\ntransfer students between the residences,\nhe said that he would like to offer\nstudents 'more suitable accommodation'.\nMiss O 'Callaghan confirmed that there\nhad been no policy decision on allocation\nto Clayponds, the first phase of which\nshould be completed by January. She said\nthat this phase should consist of '25 single\nrooms, 12 double rooms and six beds its for married couples without children',\nhopefully to be filled 'for the rest of the\nacademic year'.\nMr Marshall, explaining why Montpelier\nhad been withdrawn from the market,\nsaid that by accepting a tender the\ncollege would enter into a binding\ncontract. This meant that the tender\ndocuments had to be TOO per cent\nbomb proof and that the college had to\ninclude searches that would be performed\nby the purchaser in the case of a normal\nhouse sale.\nStarting with the post of Estates\nManager, which has been recently\nadvertised, Mr Marshall will be building\nup a new team for Estates. He intends to\nproduce a pamphlet in the near future\nsetting out his plans for the section.\nCould You Survive 9-6?\nAn increase in the length of the College\nday to start at 9.00am and finish at\n6.00pm, and a staggered lunch break, has\nbeen recommended by a Working Party.\nThere will be a student referendum on\nthe proposal, during the voting for the\nnon-sabbatical Felix Editor, on the 3rd and 4th of December.\nAs well as starting lectures on the hour,\nthe change would introduce a staggered\nlunch break, splitting the college in two.\nOne section starting at 12.00pm and one\nat l. OOpm.\nPaul Shanley, Union President, said that\nthe split may be made by department\nwith, for example, all of Guilds taking\nlunch at l. OOpm. He said that this would\nnot mean four hours of lectures as the\nmornings would be broken up with\ntutorials and seminars.\nMr Shanley agreed that a staggered\nlunch break would force clubs to\nreorganise*but did not think that any\nclubs would be killed off by the change.\nHe said that there would be certain hours\nset aside for club activities in the same\nway that Tuesday and Thursday\nlunchtimes remain free at the moment.\nHe added that queues for lunch would be\nreduced, meaning more time for other\nactivities.\nThe referendum, Mr Shanley said,\nwould consist of an extra ballot sheet,\nhanded out at the Felix election. It would\nask whether the student was for, or\nagainst, the whole proposal as a package.\nThis, he thought, would give a better\nrepresentation of student feeling than the\nresponse from the last Union General\nMeeting.\nWhen asked about the views of\nstudents. Mr Shanley said that he thought\nthat some would be in favour but that\nhalf would be against any change. He\nexplained that certain groups would not\nfind the proposed hours practical.\nMiroslav Holub Lecture\nThe internationally renowned\nimmunologist and political poet Miroslav\nHolub talked last Tuesday in a lecture\narranged by the Humanities department\nand the Huxley society. Over a hundred\nstudents were there to listen to him.\nIn his speech he explained the peculiar\nsymbiosis of science and politics in his\nnative Czechoslovakia. This, he explained,\nwas due to the nature of science which\n'teaches us not to fool ourselves' and\nwhich had a 'habit of truth'. This, he said,\nwas the reason why science was\ninstrumental in the destruction of Marxist\nideologies. As an example he cited an\nexperience he had whilst being a pathologist in northern Prague. He said\nthat he saw the corpses of patients who had trusted in the officially approved\nspiritual healers being carried away by\nthe police to prevent a public autopsy.\nHe quoted a fellow philospher in saying\nthat science needs the values of truth,\ntrust, dignity and dissent to function -making the comparison with the political\nsystem in his country to which these\nvalues were a natha ema. As well as being chief research\nimmunologist at the Institute of Clinical\nand Experimantal Medicine in Prague,\nMiroslav Holub is also a poet. He said\nthat art and science, though distinct,\nrelied on one another to be effective. He\nrecited his poem 'Reflections on a Testtube' towards the end of the lecture.\nHe accepted the presidency of the\nHuxley society, and on their behalf\nhanded over a cheque for \u00a3 5 0 0 to the\nNational Poetry Society, launching a fund\nto pay for a resident poet at the College.\nAll of Holub's books can be bought from\nthe Union Bookstore.\n2\n\n"

    "content": "What's the difference between a bus and a Rhino? Nothing to a tsetse fly.\nDr John Brady explains this and more including what turns them on as he\nexplores the life of...\nAfrican Vampires\nQuestion One: Why did Africa never\ninvent the wheel?\nAnswer: Because it was prevented from\ndoing so by a small in-offensive looking\ninsect the size of a housefly.\nThis beast\u2014the tsetse fly\u2014has maintained\nfor centuries a strangle-hold over tropical\nAfrica. Some 5,000 years ago, when\nMiddle Eastern civilisation was\ndiscovering agriculture and building the\nfirst agricultural surpluses to fuel the first\nmarket economies, the tsetse fly was\nalready beavering away in Africa biting\nall the large vertebrates it could lay its\neyes on\u2014and giving them sleeping\nsickness as it did so.\nFurther north, meanwhile, the\ndomestication of the horse had led to the\ndevelopment of the plough, and thus\nindirectly to the trade in food surpluses.\nThis in turn demanded transport and,\nwith the horse to hand, invention of the\ncart followed. In Africa, by contrast, the\nsickness carried by the tsetse prevented\nthe domestication of any beast of\nburden\u2014then as now. And without\ndraught animals there was no reason to\ninvent either wheel or plough. Hence, an\neconomy based on the hoe and the head-load: no plough, no surpluses; no\nsurpluses, no wheel.\nQuestion Two: How did the tsetse fly\nmanage this?\nAnswer: Because of an unholy alliance\nwelded by evolution between the tsetse\nand the tyr pano some. The fly needs blood to live on( it feeds on\nnothing else), and the try pano some( a microscopic blood parasite) needs to get\nfrom the bloodstream of one host to\nanother in order to survive. What\nevolution did was to select the tsetse as\nthe unwitting transmission vehicle for the\ntry pano some. The fly imbibes the\nparasites with its breakfast, and passes\nthem on with its supper. What the\nparasite then does to its victim is to so\ndebilitate it that it cannot be used for any\nkind of work, and if it is an animal new\nto Africa, like the horse, it usually dies.\nQuestion Three: What is Imperial\nCollege's interest in all this?\nAnswer: The Department of Biology has\na two-fold interest. Some of its\nparas i to logi sts are working away at the\ndefences of the try pano some \u2014a formidable challenge to both drug and\nvaccine development. And my own interest is in how the tsetse finds the\nlarger vertebrates it feeds on.\nVisualise the problem from the fly's point of view. It has poor eyes, seeing at\nbest two orders of magnitude 'worse' than\nwe do. In good light we can resolve an\nobject occupying about one minute of arc\n(0.02\u00b0) of our field of view; the tsetse is\nlucky if it can manage to resolve two\ndegrees. But that is not its only problem.\nIt lives in thick African bush that\nnormally blocks off all lines of sight more\nthan a few metres long, and it is, of\ncourse, rather small. In finding its next\nmeal, it is thus faced with a situation of\nfluttering leaves or, worse, passing\ninsectivorous birds; and slower speeds\ncan only be moving shadows.\nA nice irony is that this is the reason\nwhy tsetse are so strongly attracted to\nvehicles. Evolution did not allow for the\narrival of the tourist bus? An intriguing\nside question is why evolution did not get\ntsetse s to fly over the bush, as if they\nwere helicopters. That would seem an\nexcellent way of finding game\u2014just like\nhot-air ballooning in the Serengeti.\nThe fly's second trick is to use its nose.\nLike all good predators, when it smells a host it flies up wind to look for it. This is\nthe kind we might experience in trying to\nlocate a friend from whom we had got\nseparated while on a walk in a vast\nwood\u2014and to do so without shouting.\nThe tsetse has two tricks up its sleeve\nto solve this conundrum. The first is a neat piece of neural economy provided\nfor it by evolution. Unlike us, it is not\nimpressed by the appearance of things. In\nour experiments at Silwood it shows little\ninterest in the shape or colour of\npotential targets; all that really turns it on\nis the speed the targets move at.\nSpecifically, it is the targets' angular\nvelocity past it which matters, and which\nthe fly finds really attractive only\nbetween 2 and 5 \u00b0 s_1. The clever thing\nabout this is that it is precisely the speed\none would expect any large vertebrates\nwithin the fly's visual range (say 10-30m) to move at as they browse through the\nbush. Faster speeds are likely to be only\nsimple enough to say, but the words hide\na multitude of navigational problems.\nHow does the tsetse know where the\nwind is coming from? How does it head\nup wind while flying? Does it, indeed,\nhead up wind at all, or does it do\nsomething else? It certainly does not\narrive at a potential meal in a straight\nline, since even though it flies at over 5\nms_1 it takes minutes to find a host\nanimal after first smelling it. These are\nproblems that interest me and my colleagues very much, and we are\ncurrently pursuing them\u2014with a video\ncamera.\nWhat we do is to fly out to somewhere\nnice in Africa with good research\nfacilities\u2014such as a bar and swimming\npool\u2014and then set up the cameras.\nUsually we suspend them from a kind of\nsky-hook, so that they look down at the\n\n"

Before WorldWar II it openly\nmodelled itself on Fascism, people who\noppose the current regime on libertarian\ngrounds need have no sympathy with the\nnationalists.\nThe cultural revolution was supposed to\nmove power away from the bureaucrats\nand party elite, to ordinary people where\nit belonged. Unfortunately Mao was afraid\nto let it get 'out of control'. He thought\nthat democracy had to be balanced by strong leadership. He suppressed people's grievances against those elements of the\nparty and the state that were the real\nenemies of the people, because of the\nsupposed need for 'unity'.\nThere is no reason to believe that\nworkers' and peasants' self-organisation\ncould not have dispensed with the state\naltogether, and prevented the\ntransformation into capitalism that has\nbeen brutally forced on the Chinese\npeople since Mao's death.\nBy giving some people power over\nothers, the state creates the opportunity\nfor personal corruption. The state, low\nwages and high prices are necessary to\ncreate the profits that capitalism (the\nexploitation of people by a parasitic\nruling elite) demands.

    "content": "Pet Shop Boys\n\u2014Behaviour LP\nBehaviour is the fifth album from the\nShoppies, comprising their first new\nmaterial for almost three years. Somehow\nit comes as no surprise to find that they\nhaven't chosen to divert from their own eccentric path through rock 'n' roll.\nFor this record the duo are reputed to\nhave gone in search of the oldest synths\nthey could find (Casio VL-Tone owners of\nthe world unite) for those elusive\nspaceship landing noises. Whether this is\ntrue or not, certainly the record sounds\nsimpler than their previous denser work;\nproduction by Harold ' Axel F' Faltermeyer highlights this with decidedly\nlow-key mixing.\nThe album opens with Being Boring\nwhich is either autobiographical\nor...something else. This track is so gentle\nit's almost offensive, but simultaneously\ncarries the usual hideously addictive vocal\nhook (all the more so for the triteness of\nthe lyrics). The second track is burdened\nwith an intolerably long name which I cannot be bothered to repeat here; a neat\nmid-pace sweep with an arc of guitar\nfrom Johnny Marr and possibly the most\nfamiliar make-up of any track on the\nrecord. To Face The Truth follows and\nthe Shoppies make the mistake of falling\ninto standard dance/soul patterns with\nthe result that the song is appalling. Next\nup is How Can You Expect To Be Taken\nSeriously?, a quick and witty snipe at\nrock monsters and their fans.\nThe flip opens with My October\nSymphony, worth a mention for a guest\nappearance by the Balanescu String\nQuartet (who supported, for want of a better word, on the tour). So Hard\nfollows, oddly out of place, then\nNervously, a relative non-entity; The End\nOf The World is another bittersweet\nbreakup song. Jealousy closes the LP quietly.\nBehaviour is not the Pet Shop Boys'\nfinest moment but fans won't be\ndisappointed and they may gain a few\nconverts. The next single Being Boring is\ndue for release on November 12th and a tour is in the works.\nStone\nWorld of\nIf you're a regular club goer and an\nindie/dance crossover love child, you'll\nlove this EP. It is made up of the 7\" and\n12\" versions of The Storm and covers of\nthe Rolling Stones' She's Like a Rainbow.\nHowever, it is very much a studio sound,\nand we doubt they would be able to\nreproduce it live.\nThe Storm (7\") is fairly poppy, but\nlyrically sound (Tve tried a thousand\ntimes to make the sun shine in my mind.\nBut the mind will not be warmed, I can't release it from the storm'). The 12\" is\ncompletely different (is this the same\nsong?) heavily featuring wah-wah guitar\nand a typical dance drum beat, along\nwith lots of spacey, twirl y noises. And just as you are beginning to think this is\nan instrumental and definitely not the\nsame song\u2014in comes a few muffled,\nTwist\n\u2014The Storm EP\nsubdued words and then a burst of the\nchorus. She's Like a Rainbow (7\") could\nalmost be mistaken for the original if it\nwasn't for the added drum beat, whereas\nthe 12\" adds numerous extra\ninstrumental bits. Considering the recent\npopularity of the remixed Sympathy for\nthe Devil, this is sure to be at least\nmoderately successful.\nSo our verdict: all in all, really quite\ngood.\nPinky and Perky.\nThe Real\nPeople\n\u2014Window Pane 12\"\nLoaded with dancy rhythms, loaded with\nguitar driven melodies, loaded\nwith...loaded (Primal Scream).\nAnother dose of indie dance, but this\ntastes surprisingly good. Using a proving\nformula and doing it as good as anyone,\nThe Real People may have a winner\nhere.\nI was hoping for something new, a progression from the now year-old dance\ncrossover (perhaps an experiment in\nsuperposition of drum tracks) but this will\ndo for now.\nGreame\nCompetition\nWe are giving you another chance to win a copy of Prefab Sprout's latest album,\nJordan: The Comeback, by answering the\nfollowing questions:\nWho featured on harmonica on the From\nLangley Park To Memphis album?\nWhich of the following is NOT a Prefab\nSprout song?\na) Doo Wop In Harlam\nb) The Devil Has All The Best Tunes\nc) Green Isaac\nd) On The Right Hand Of God\nWho are the last four tracks on side one\nof Jordan about?\nWhich two members of the band are\nrelated and what do they play?\nSend your answers, including which\nformat you prefer, CD or cassette, to the\nFELIX office to arrive no later than\nWednesday November 21st.

    "content": "A Man Escaped Darkman\nI This is an escape story, with a difference. The focus is on one\nman, Lt Fontaine, captured and\nimprisoned by the Gestapo. From the\nmoment of his capture, he tries to escape,\nagain and again.\nRobert Bresson is well known for his\nsharp and minimalist style, and this film\nis an excellent example. We hardly see\nthe faces of the German guards or of the\nGestapo. They are not important. We see\nFontaine not as a lieutenant of the\nFrench Resistance, but as the caged\nanimal they have reduced him to. Yet\nthey are unable to strip away his human\ndignity.\nIn a place aimed totally at breaking the\nhuman spirit, where confinement is\nsolitary and betrayal commonplace, men\nstill manage to befriend and support one\nanother. Bresson draws a careful contrast\nbetween Fontaine and a fellow prisoner,\na priest, who, the Gestapo having\ndeprived him of his Bible, borrows a pencil (forbidden in the prison) off his\nfellows, that he may write down his\nbeloved verses. For, as he says, every\nman must have a religion, an occupation,\nto stop him going mad. 'Moi, je\nm'oc cup e,' says Fontaine, and goes back\nto his religion, the act of attempting to\nescape.\nThe spirituality of this act is simply and\nbeautifully illustrated by Bresson. His\ncamera makes us love Fontaine, root for\nhim and hold our breaths in turn, as he\nquietly and patiently concentrates on his\ntask, under sentence of death from his\ncaptors.\nBresson employed non-professional\nactors in this film. Francois Leterrier is\nwonderful as Fontaine, without stealing\nthe show completely from the supporting\ncast, who help integrate the film\neffectively.\nA warning: if you're interested in a good old rollicking, un taxing comedy for\na night's entertainment, this is just the\nopposite: stay away! On the other hand, if\nyou have a single shred of humanity in\nyou, that shred will beg for a film like\nthis. Bresson has long been an inspiration\nfor many of today's famous directors. It is\nnot difficult to see why, nor to\nunderstand how this film won him the\naward for Best Director, at Cannes in\n1957.\nZia Akbar.\nThe Reflecting Skin\n1y favourite occupation of a Iweekend evening (after the bar has\n\u2022closed) is to watch films on Channel\n4 or BBC2 that an Irish gentleman that is\noften also in the common room describes\nas 'Fuckin' Wierd'. This film would slip\nbeautifully into that category. All the\ncharacteristics of an art-house movie are\nthere, the amazing, visually stunning and\nquietly symbolic photography, the bizarre\nsequence of events, the odd characters.\nThe last might be explained by the fact\nthat the film is being told from a child's viewpoint (reminiscent of Yaaba - another\nart house reference) who is trapped in a nightmare only partially of his own making. He has a pervert for a father, a brother involved in atomic testing and a domineering mother. His friends are one\nby one being murdered, and he believes\nthe widow his brother has fallen in love\nwith is a vampire.\nFrom exploding frogs to self-immolation, this film deals with the\ndarker sides of our natures and fears as\nSeth tries to make sense of the adult\nworld and makes decisions that will affect\nthe rest of his life. Some of the sequences\nare rather disturbing, and not a little\ngrizzly, so the film is not for the faint of\nheart, but it's worth the effort. This really\nis a imaginative and original film that I enjoyed far more than I expected to do.\nHopefully its normal theatrical release\nwill give it the recognition it deserves.\nPendragon.\ni Dark man opens with the unlikely\npremise that Larry Drake is a bloody hoodlum with a penchant\nfor amputation. This may seem perfectly\nsober unless you recall that Mr. Drake is\nthe gentleman who portrays the retarded\noffice clerk, Benny, in LA Law. Alas, the\nlatter part is stronger than the first, and\nso the first scene is somewhat surreal as\nBenny's dark alter ego (replete with grey\nsilk scarf draped round his neck)\nrampages through a rival gang. Numerous\npieces of heavy artillery wave around in\nthe background, although a few truly\ndreadful gags are sufficient to see off\nmost of the bad guys.\nHaving firmly established the baddies,\nit's time to meet the hero. Peyton\nWestlake is a( sorry, I feel a Capital\nLetter Atttack coming on) Mild-Mannered\nScientist who has made a Stagggering But\nFlawed Discovery; to wit, the production\nof synthetic skin. Unfortunately, the skin\nis only stable for 100 minutes...\nPeyton's girlfriend is an accountant (or\nsomething) who stumbles into a big Gang\nThing. Predictably enough this results in\nthe hapless Peyton being beaten up.acid-scarred and generality not flying Business\nClass. Believed dead, he is treated by\nexperimental surgery which shorts out his\nfiner feelings. Being, not unnaturally,\nsomewhat peeved, he escapes and sifts\nthrough his laboratory wreckage...\nThe rest of the film concerns itself with\nthe mutilated Peyton's shift into the\nDarkman, who uses his artificial skin to\nmake perfect masks of his adversaries,\nrevenge himself and win back his\ngirlfriend from the Big Bad Guy. This\nappears to consist of a tiresomely large\nnumber of bad jokes, an un arguably well\nchoreographed but over familiar sequence\nof stunts and some staggering overacting.\nDarkman is visually very slick, and the\nwhole thing (plot (!), effects and\ndirectorial style) is taken directly from\ncomic-books of the '70's. Regrettably, this\nis not as entertaining as it might sound.\nStay home and watch Neighbours.\nThe Flying Gerbil And Friend.\n6\n\n"

    "content": "Bift!\nLast week over three days saw the\nproceedings of the United Kingdom\nConference on Overseas Students\nAssociation. Paul Shanley, your president,\nattended as the representative of Imperial\nCollege Union and we give a brief run\ndown on his actions. This report being in\nresponse to his challenge last week for\nme to find out as much as possible\nthrough my spy network.\nWe start with the train journey to\nLeeds on Monday. Here Paul managed to\nfind a Turrettes Syndrome case to sit\nopposite. His vocal emanations were not\nas bad as some. Instead of uttering\nobscenities in abstract manner he would\ninstead whelp, growl and bark. So put off\nby this outrageous display, Paul had to\nmake a move and decided to mask the\naction by pretending to leave the train at\nthe next station. Now seated in the other\ncarriage he could still hear his previous\nseat-mates calls and waited in anticipation\nfor the ticket collector...\nFor the rest of the journey Paul worked upon his U GM report and the induction\nnotes for the new Union Manager, Mandy\nHurford.\nArriving at Leeds he settled in at the\nhotel but didn't meet his room mate.\nBeing a good boy he attended all his\nseminars before going out in the evening\nto get pissed. This he did without any\nproblem, as you might imagine.\nHis enjoyment of the evening drink was\nobviously far too much for him to take\nand he soon had to retire to bed. At this\npoint he still had not met his room mate.\nMark Crawley concludes from his\nobservations that Mr Shanley has no\nstamina. Upon each night when returning\nto their room he found him already fast\nasleep. And, when Mark awoke and got\nup Shan was still virtually asleep. His\nmumbling s unintelligible and his eyes\nlooking knacker ed. At this point he still\nhad not managed to introduce himself to\nhis room-mate.\nPart way through the second day Mark\napproached Mr Shanley and enquired\nwhether he had been disturbed when he\ngot in last night or earlier on this\nmorning. Shan looked perplexed. Who was this person. Suddenly, at last, it all\nbecame apparent. This was his room-mate\nthat he had tried to communicate with\nearlier. Unfortunately you see, Shan\nwears contact lenses and without them is\nbat-like, as it were. Finally Mark pointed\nout to me that 'he's got a hell of a snore.'.\nOn the second day the business came\nand went much as it had the day before.\nThe evening itself started in pretty much the same way until the pool games\nbegan. This apparently innocuous game\nhad the effect of speeding the alcohol\nthrough his system. During one phase he\nlined up a shot which took him about ten\nminutes. After this intense bout of\nconcentration he stood up, as best he\ncould, and asked the question ' Am1 spots\nor stripes'. From now on our very own pool hall hustler would be known as\n'Stripes'.\nThe evening wore on and the stomachs\nwore out. Midnight came around and the\nmunchies paid a visit. It was agreed that\nsometime soon a curry would have to be\nsought. Later, not wishing to strain\nhimself by venturing outside, Shan had a 'bizarre idea'. Fridges were to be raided,\nas in the tradition of Evelyn Gardens and,\n1 suppose, all other college residences. He wandered off and didn't return, despite\nthe fact that the others continued with\ntheir game until 3 o 'clock. The next\nmorning he had no better explanation\nthan just having a walk to freshen up. His\ncolleagues believe that a walk to the\ntoilet was more in order considering his\npale face.\nChris Hayes, one of his social\ncolleagues, said that he was 'not a great\nsocial is er' and that he was 'a bit of let\ndown' for the ICU side. He added that he\nhad been promised a copy of a couple of\nvideos Rainbow and Playschool but had\nnot heard from him. Finally, after his hard work on the\ntrain, he managed to leave his U GM report and Mandy's induction notes in\nLeeds, probably due to his excessive\ndrinking. 1 would also just like to thank\nMr Shanley in advance for cleaning the\nfloors of my offices, as agreed as his\nforfeit.\nChris Stapleton\n^Cke fractals\nJlovc ^>e ace Si Sma.U^ tue jr-to wc is Live at the RCS Smoking Concert\nDate 22 November 1990\nTime Approximately 10 pm\nPlace Union Concert Hall\nBe there, or be elsewhere.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nSPECIAL TRIAL\nEVENING\nOPENING\n5.30-9.00pm of the\nCATERPILLAR\nCAFE\n(Beit Quad)\nROLLS-HOT MEALS-JACKET\nPOTATO BURGERS-HOT DOGS\nLine your stomach\u2014soak up the\nalcohol and enjoy Rag Week\n\n"

Because tsetse s are so small,\nhowever, we can only look at about 2 m by 3 m of bush at a time. And as the flies\nmove so fast (7 ms~'=15 mph) we see\nonly fleeting glimpses of their flight tracks\nas they respond to the artificial host\nodour s we have floated on the wind. It is\na bit like trying to work out the rules of\nfootball by watching a videotape\nrestricted to close-up shots of the players.\nThings are beginning to emerge,\nhowever. The rules of the game we have\nidentified so far are, first, that if you are\na tsetse looking for a whiff of host odour,\nyou search downwind. If you then chance\nto fly into a stream of air that smells\napp et ising, rule two says that you should\nperform aU turn to get back in.\nThere are complicating rules about\nwhat to do when you find an obvious\nlarge object as you fly through the bush.\nIf it turns out to be animal, you may land\nand eat. If, however, as is more likely, it\nturns out to be only a tree trunk, or some\nirrelevant structure stuck out there by an\ninquisitive entomologist, more subtle sub-rules about the direction to fly away from\nit must be followed. Annex B should be\nconsulted if you meet along the way\nanother fly of the opposite sex, since for\nthe sake of the future it is more\nimportant to have it off with them than\nto look for breakfast.\nWhile I freely admit that I find\nanalysing this game highly entertaining, it\ndoes actually have a practical purpose,\ntoo. In Zimbabwe they have spent years\ndevising an environmentally friendly\nsystem to control tsetse flies\u2014to get\nround the alternative, rather less\nenvironmentally friendly approach of\nkilling them by blanket coverage of\nAfrica with insecticide sprayed from\naircraft. The Zimbabwe system is based\non a1m2 screen baited with essence of\nox and soaked in quick-acting insecticide.\nThis 'artificial cow' is evidently\nir resist able to the flies and, scattered at\n500-m intervals throughout the bush,\nattracts and kills all the local tsetse within\na few months (a vache fatale perhaps?).\nOur role in this work appears at the\nsubsequent development stages, when it\nbecomes useful to know what aspects of\nartificial odour streams attract tsetse, how\nthe flies approach the screens, and how\nthey behave when they get to them. Only\nwith such knowledge is it likely to be\npossible to opt i mise the design to best\nattract flies and induce them to land\nfirmly on the screens.\nComplete the above figure so that all the lines total 38.\nSCIENCE\n\u2022 Can you write interesting and informative features\non scientific matters that affect our everyday lives?\n\u2022 Are you interested in a particular branch or aspect\nof your course?\n\u2022 Are you doing some revolutionary research that will\nchange our lives forever?\nIf so, I want to hear from you.\nCome into the FELIX office any lunchtime and ask for\nIan or dial 3515 internal.\n13\n\n"

It was\nsuspected at the time that Imperial\nCollege Union (ICU) members were those\nresponsible and one of them was traced\nfrom the description given by one of the\nbarman.\nLater, six more offenders came forward\nand admitted taken part in the act. They\nwere ordered to pay the cost of repairs\nand fined by ICU. The money from the\nfines will go towards Rag.\nIt was thought at the time that the\nincident had occured because of inflamed\nfeelings over mascot ry.A treasure hunt,\norganised by St.Mary's students earlier\nthis term, had lead to the loss of a number of signs from Imperial, together\nwith a Shield from City and Guilds Union.\nIn light of this the items have and are\nbeing returned.\nThis year's beer festival raised almost\n\u00a34100. According to the Royal College of\nScience (RCS), who or gain is e the festival,\nnot all the beer was sold, partly due to\nthe lights in the JCR being turned off at\n10.00pm. These lights are computer\ncontrolled and could have been turned\nback on by security, if they had found\nthe right key.\nThe lights finally came back on at 10.30\nwhen the price of a pint was reduced.\nLater, the RCS gave away free beer in an\nattempt to clear the remaining stock.\nChas Randies, the RCS Vice President last\nyear, said that everybody had left by\n11.30 and that there was no trouble.\nThe rag stall sold \u00a3952 worth of rag\nmags and T shirts during the festival and\nwill be selling the remaining 'Elephants\nCome 91' glasses for \u00a3 1 . 5 0 each in the\nUnion lounge during lunchtime today.\nAlso available are 'Dragon Divine 89' Tshirts and past rag mags.\nPoor Uptake for Student Loans\nAt the last Finance and Executive\nCommittee meeting, on the 2nd November, it was disclosed that only 150\nstudents from Imperial had taken up a Student Loan. Yesterday, the figure stood\nat 200, indicating that just 10 students\nwere applying each day that the office\nwas open.\nPeter Mee, the College Registrar,\nsuggested that a 'sensible thing to do'\nwould be to invest in the forthcoming\nelectricity share offer. Past records\nsuggest that an investment of \u00a3460 in\nTSB, British Gas, Rolls Royce, British\nTelecom, British Steel and other similar\nfloatations would profit the investor by\n\u00a3 8 0 within the first few weeks.\nUnlike some banks' limited overdrafts, a Student Loan is not interest free but is\nlinked to the rate of inflation. The\nmaximum loan is \u00a3 4 6 0 in London,\nrent better accommodation. When questioned further as to how investing in\na mountain bike would help them to pay\noff the loan after three years, many\nresponded by saying that they would be\nleaving the country after their course.\nThere have been rumours that there\ncould be restrictions on foreign travel\namongst British graduates to prevent this\nhappening. It has been suggested that the\nloan repayment should be waived if the\nre payed a year later. If \u00a3 4 6 0 is borrowed\neach year for a three year course, \u00a3 1 4 9 0\nwould have to be re payed, based on the\npresent inflation rate of about 8%.\nWhen a few students were asked what\nthey would use the loaned money for, a minority said they would invest the\nmoney in a high interest account. The rest said that they would buy new cameras, mountain bikes, computers, or\nmeaning that \u00a3 4 9 5 would have to be\nstudent works in this country for three\nyears after graduation.\nAnybody interested in applying for a loan should visit room345 on level 3 of\nthe Sherfield Building on a Monday,\nWednesday or Friday between 11.45am and 3.15pm. Bring with you your birth\ncertificate, a letter confirming a grant and\ndetails of your bank account.\nFREE GIFT when you join THE STOCK EXCHANGE INVESTORS CLUB( Reduced Subscription to FBI members)\nJoin upon TUESDAY20 th NOVEMBER in Math sRm410 at 12:30 pm.4 "

    "content": "Sports Ladies Hockey\nThe ladies 1st XI had a successful week\nwinning all three of their matches.\nWednesday's game against Sussex was to\nbe the make or break of the U AU for the\nteam. It was vital that they won to stand\na chance of reaching the next round. The game was very equal and produced the\nbest hockey played this term. Lisa Preedy\nscored the winning goal within the first\nten minutes of the match by taking it\nfrom before the halfway line. IC defence\nwas strong while the forwards had\nseveral more shots at goal and were\nunlucky not to score again.\nThe match on Saturday was a Middlesex league match against Old Kingstonians I. Imperial were slow to get\ninto the game and did not play to their\ntrue ability. However, after the first 15\nminutes, IC began to control the match\nand this was secured by Karen Young's goal. The second goal was scored from a short corner with an excellent strike by\nJane Bunch. Final score.: 2-0 to Imperial.\nFinally on Sunday, IC played the first\nround of the UL Cup. Without the usual\n1st XI team, IC managed to win by 3-0.\nThe score does not reflect the game as\nRoyal Free I were strong opposition and\nhad numerous shots at goal.\nCongratulations must go to the IC goalie,\nAlison Franklin, for not letting in a goal\nall week.\nFootball\nIC IV-3 Goldsmith's III - 1\nAs the match got underway, the cocky\nopposition were stunned into silence. IC\nimmediately gained the initiative, and\ndeservedly took the lead 5 minutes later\nwhen John Mottashed scored with a cracking 30 yard shot. IC piled on the\npressure and, with probably the best\npassing move of the day, Kev McCann set\nup a simple tap in for John's second.\nAfter the teams changed ends, Kev should have wrapped things up. Instead\nhe performed one of rugby's better\nconverted kicks from which the\nopposition pulled back a scrappy goal and\npushed for the equalise r. Things began to\nlook ominous and with ten minutes\nremaining, their centre-forward broke\nthrough squeezing the ball, past IC's stranded keeper, towards the goal. The worst seemed inevitable until Damon Thomas accomplished an astonishing slide\nto scoop the ball off the line.\nEncouraged by this, IC pressed forward\nand Gary Mahoney curled in a beautiful\nfree kick to finish off a brilliant all-round\nteam performance.\nHang Gliding\nCongratulations to Catherine and Simon\nfor obtaining their Fls. Anyone wishing to learn to hang-glide\nor para glide between December 15-22 in\nthe Isle of Wight, should give their names\nto Yasmin as soon as possible. A \u00a3 3 0\ndeposit will be required.\nThere will be a chance to try other\nsports such as surfing, sailing and\nmountain biking.\nThe universities are provided with a special winter rate of \u00a3 1 3 5 (of which 30%\nwill be sub sidi sed) for a5 day course. The\ncourse takes you to EP C level in both\nsports and is open ended for a year.\nInsurance is currently \u00a3 1 5 for three\nmonths para gliding or \u00a3 2 5 hang gliding.\nAccommodation (everything inclusive)\nwill range between \u00a3 2 0 and \u00a3 4 0 for the\nweek.\nIf you wish to learn more, join us on\nFridays at 12.30pm in Southside Upper\nLounge. Alternatively contact Yasmin Saudi P/H in Maths.\nWu-Shu-Kwan\nMark Howser Maths III became the Wu Shu-Kwan British Kickboxing Champion\non Sunday October 28, competing in the\nsix monthly Wu-Shu-Kwan tournament in\nSurbiton Surrey.\nHis first fight proved his toughest, being\nknocked down in the first round. Allowed to continue Mark recovered superbly and\nhalf-way through the second round his\nopponent drained and, unable to\ncontinue, surrendered to a technical\nknockout.\nNext came the semi-final and a draw\nagainst the reigning champion Dave\nFinch. The fight was fast and furious\nresulting with Finch flat on the canvas\ninside the first round and Mark a place in\nthe final.\nAt the end of the long tournament it\nwas time for the finals and Mark entered\nthe ring full of confidence. After only 90\nseconds of the first round, and following\na ruthlessly powerful assault by Mark, his\nopponent was flat on his face.\nThis left Mark the first ever champion,\nin any weight division, to come from\nImperial College and all of the club looks\nforward to seeing him defend his title in\nsix months time.\nSwimming\nOn Friday November 2 a sponsored swim,\nin aid of the National Asthma Campaign,\ntook place at Imperial College Swimming Pool. Although the turn-out was a little\ndisappointing, especially amongst club\nmembers, the event was a success with\nover \u00a3750 being raised.\nMany thanks to those who pledged\nmoney, and to those who eventually took\npart. We hope to have the money\ncollected, and passed on, soon so if\neveryone 'pays up' quickly it would be a great help.\nCross Country\nIt was with some trepidation that the\nnormally confident, bla se,x country team\narrived at Guildford, scene of the second\ninstallment of the soap opera that is the\nLondon Colleges League. Not only did the\ncourse have a reputation of severely cold\ndeath, but some splendidly erratic\nminibus driving had reduced several of\nthe team into nervous wrecks well before\nthe starting gun had been fired. With\nseveral first-team stalwarts mysteriously\nmissing, the opposition may have sensed\na whiff of a possible upset. However,\nwithin the first mile, Paul Northrop had\nposed a question no one in the 130\nstrong field could answer. Despite\nclaiming to have had a bad run, he was\nnever headed and charged away to his\nsecond win. Frank Dudbridge and Alex Gaskell enjoyed a ding-dong encounter\nbehind him, their personal battle\neventually taking its toll as they were\npassed in the later stages. League veteran\nFrank staggered in 7th, with the younger\nAlex plodding home 8th. Bill Skailes,\nwearing a suspiciously new t shirt,\nmanaged 29th, and Laurence Fowkes,\nminus his appendix, 38th; a good\nperformance since racing is all about\nguts. The combined points enabled IC to\nhead the League at this race, and thus\nextend its savage overall lead.\nThe women's team were placed fourth\noverall, after Edwige Pitel, in an\ninexplicable fit of keenness, overshot the\nfinish by 200 metres and lost 12 places\nbefore collecting her disc. This enabled\nHelen Macintosh to nip in and claim 13th, Edwige winding up i \"th, Keri WardenO wen28t h and Sonya Legg 31st. A death\nof attitude restricted the second men's team to just three runners and thus the\nearly floundering of their promotion\ncampaign; however Dave Budgett's64 th place gave him enough points to\nencroach onto the individual's leader\nboard.\n14\n\n"

    "content": "Wear 5i A LETTERS\nBaas Dear Chris,\nIn Ireland, the belief is still widely held\nthat the most fundamental human right is\nthe right to life, whether the human in question be born or unborn, unlike in\nmainland Britain where the monetarist\nphilosophy is so deeply entrenched that\nan unplanned child is seen as nothing\nmore than an impediment to one's career\nor quality of life and for which there is a Get your\nDOG'S BOLLOCKS\nand your\nSPUNKY PARTS\nat IC Bookstore\nNOW!!\nMany other comic\nannuals available too!!\nIdeal Christmas\npresents for Grandma!\nconvenient and final solution freely\navailable.\nIf the situation in Ireland is oppressive\nnow, it won't be for much longer. The\nelection of Mary Robinson as President\nwill mean big improvements in Irish\nWomen's rights in the next few years. If\nany campaigning is required, it must be\nto help remove the need for abortion, by\nimproved family planning services and\nbetter welfare provision for the family.\nAbortion is an easy way of masking\ninadequacies in these areas, hence the\nsupport given to this option by successive\ngovernments and the ever compliant\nmedia, which has succeeded in dictating\npublic opinion into acceptance of this\nmethod of brushing these problems under\nthe carpet. Women's rights must be\nimproved, but this can be achieved\nwithout abandoning the most fundamental\nhuman right.\nI would urge anyone intending to\nsupport the Irish students to first seriously\nconsider their motives for doing so, and\nabove all I hope that IC Union remains\ndetached from both sides of the debate.\nThis should be a matter for individuals to\ndecide their own position, if IC Union\nadopts a stance it will be guilty of the\nexcesses that d is affiliation from the NUS\nwas to avoid.\nYours,\nRob Crompton, Elec Eng 2.\nPresident, ICU Pro-Life.\nBaas Dear Sir,\nFirst, my replies. Communication in writing assumes the correct use of\nvocabulary, Saleem Choudhery. If I were\nto say that bananas are blue, it might be\ndue to a careless vocabulary, or it might\nbe because I honestly believed it to be\ntrue. Mr Amin El-Choly stated that the\nidea of punishing Iraq (I assume this is\nthe political statement he refers to) would\noffend the hostages and Kuwaitis. As a Briton, Is y mpa this e with the hostages\nheld in Kuwait and their relatives. But I can honestly say that if I or my family\nwere held hostage, 1 would not give into\nsuch terrorism because it grants a licence\nto anyone to try it. Surely it's obvious\nthat one cannot give in to terrorism? Now let's turn to those other hostages; the\nKuwaitis. We hear on the news of the\ndaily killing of Kuwaitis which has been\ngoing on now for almost three months.\nAt a rate of one per day, that's84 dead,\nand I bet one per day is sublimely\noptimistic. As long as the rest of the\nworld allows Iraq to stay in Kuwait,\nKuwaitis will die. Lots of them. What\nAmin El-Choly and Saleem Choudhery are\nperhaps suggesting, is that we should\nallow the Kuwaitis to die in order to free\nthe Britons. Perhaps you are white racists\nyourselves.\nAs to the trivial discussion of 'Athena'\nas a pseudonym (Amin El-Choly, issue\n882).

My spies have been hard at work and\ndone my research.\nAppropriately placed on the Union page\noverleaf, I have written an informal\nappraisal of his deeds. Although not a gloating expo see of sex and drug orgies 1\ndo feel that it acts as a very nice\ncharacter profile.\nThere is one bit that 1 missed out due\nto late arrival of information, so 1 shall\nadd it here. At the end of the story 1\nfinish with Shan's slip of leaving behind\nhis U GM report etc in Leeds. On Wednesday night he worked long and\nhard to reproduce what he had\npreviously prepared, for the Thursday\nmeeting. Only after the meeting had\ntaken place did poor old Shan find the\nmissing report in the back pocket of his\njeans! I must just say that it will nice to\nhave someone vacuuming the office floors\nfor once, aye Shan.\nMore Spies\nTalking of spies, the interest in Athena's true identity seems to be hot ting up. This\nis at least so in the office as 1 have been\ncontinually bombarded with questions\nasking who they really are. Unfortunately\nfor the curious I am not about to reveal\ntheir identity.\nHowever, this hasn't stopped those with\nlust for knowledge. They have already\ndeciphered the fact that the writer owns\nor operates an Archimedes computer, likes\nthe font Homerton Medium, and printed\nout his draft copy on Wednesday\nlunchtime. The text was transferred onto\na5.25\" disc via a1.2 Megabyte machine\nand probably printed on a post script\nprinter. He is a dedicated typist and\nalthough Athena has not written in by\nhand as yet he labeled his disc by hand\nand the graphologists are at work. By the\n.GETS LMD\nff ll X.

It's more like a ramble through the jungle than a nice\nday in the office dear. It would be nice to\nthink that the beast will be up and\nrunning later today, but who knows.\nDisturbing\nWe received a letter at the office a couple of days ago concerning the 24\nhour collection for Mencap. This event\nhappened a couple of weeks ago and\nfeatured some of the more experienced\nrag teams from around the country.\nCardiff Rag, who wrote the letter, in\nparticular had an impressive turn out and\ncollected for the whole of the 24 hour\nperiod in many successful places.\nThe letter describes various problems\nthat occured while working with the ICU\nRag team who hosted the event. At this\npoint in time we have not yet had time\nto properly analyse the facts from all\nsides and without this any speculation is\npointless. However, if stories of missing\ncollecting cans are valid then somebody,\nsomewhere has got to start worrying.\nEven if the missing money simply turns\nup on another student union's charity\ntotal it still allows suspicion and doubt to\nrear its ugly head.

Laced with such classic\nlines as 'So sing it now or we won't get\npaid,' it's a jovial tale of desperate songwriting in the traffic jam on the way to\nthe studio (sounds a bit like The Cure).\nUtterly brilliant.\nSJH\n-T& CC 5.11.90\nLush as you would know if you came\nfrom North of the Tyne means dead\ngood, brilliant etc, and Lush the band\ncertainly are.\nA four piece band from London\nconsisting of Miki (guitar/vocals), Emma( guitar/backing vocals), Steve (bass) and\nChris (drums) they met (apart from\nEmma) as students at North London Poly\na few years ago.\nLush have a distinctive sound\ncombining j ingly jan gly guitars with sweet\nharmonious vocals. A sort of Cocteau\nTwins meet Ride.\nThe gig began with a spectacular\nentrance by Emma who tripped over a guitar lead, but all the laughs were lost as\nthe band plunged into their first number.\nThe set consisted of all their releases\u2014\nfrom their debut EP5 car, through Mad\nLove (which made the top 50) to their\nlatest EP Sweetness and Light. They even\nhad to repeat a song for their second\nencore! Lush have apparently given some\nawful live performances in the past, but\ntonight they sounded confident, fluent\nand accomplished. If you've got any\nsense, you'll go out today and spend the\nrest of your grant on ALL three Lush\nEPs.\nFinally the fresh-faced support act\ndeserve a mention\u2014Faith Over Reason\u2014\nwho, despite having popped straight out\nof the Sundays mould are a good band in\ntheir own right.\nPinky and Perky.\nFe loDeS e \u2014Trap Door\nAfter what seemed an eternity at City\nUniversity's Trapdoor, some life on stage\ngave the crowd something to stir about.\nAdmittedly, as two sparklers were lit on stage, 1 would rather have been round a bonfire watching a stuffed Guy Fawkes\nbeing burnt.\nFelo De Se finally started despite\nproblems with the PA, namely someone\nputting a compressor on it. However the\ndistinctive band sound, somewhere\nbetween the Breeders and B52s, pulled\nthrough making the first song, Fantasia,\none of the most memorable.\nDespite the over-zealous drummer,\nthere was some immaculate guitar work,\nwhich never lost its excellence. Felo even\nattempted Hendrix's Foxy Lady (the\ncheeky sods) and coped admirably.\nThe vocalist's dancing around the stage\nwith much arm waving and hanging from\nthe mike stand was entertaining, but he\nshould still do the Right Thing, and leave\nhis female counterpart to do a lot more\nsinging and less backing. The one song\nshe performed herself, Close The Door,\nwas superb with beautiful dreamy vocals;\na song you would want to die to.\nThe keyboards filled in the spaces and\nthe overall effect was very pleasing. Ents\nwould be doing no bad thing to have\nthem play here.\nMAK with thanks to Brian\n8\n\n"

    "content": "My Blue Heaven I My Blue Heaven is very very very\nvery happy. It really is happy. If\nyou've seen a sad movie, it\ncertainly isn't this one, because this\nmovie reactivates, exhilarates and\nexterminates (possibly not the last).\nTo summarise the plot : Rick Moranis is\nhappy. Until his wife leaves him. Steve\nMartin is happy. Until his wife leaves him.\n(We should point out that Steve Martin is\na super grass who has been given a new\nidentity and Rick is the FBI agent\nassigned to babysit. Not that Steve has a baby but we're sure he was one once (or\ntwice)). Steve has extreme difficulty with\na) adjusting to small-town life b) his^ tailor\nc) his kleptomania. As such he is\nperpetually being arraigned by the local\ndistrict attorney (Joan Cusack, late of\nWorking Girl). Undisturbed by this he\ncontinues in his naughtiness under the\ncomfortable duvet of FBI security. Rick is\nforced to confront Joan (who finds the\nsmall hairs on the back of her neck rising\nin his presence) amidst Steve's attempts\nThe Colony\na Cropper\nI This is actually two plays. The first\nThe Colony by Marivaux was\nwritten in the eighteenth century\nand some of the ideas he comes up with\nare very surprising for their time.\nA group of men and women are\nshipwrecked on a desert island and\ntherefore no country's laws can have any\nauthority over them. So a new\ngovernment has to be set up and a new\nconstitution written. Of course, the\ngovernment won't include the women\u2014it\nnever has, why should they worry their\nheads about it? The women however\nhave other ideas and stage a protest\nabout their non-inclusion in affairs of\nstate and law and justice. Marivaux was\nnot a feminist but many of the ideas put\nforward in this play are interesting in\nview of the time. There was a lot of\ndebate going on in France at this time\nabout women's rights. Despite this, I found this play rather drawn out, it didn't hold my interest to the end. It also\nseemed rather artificial, although at times\nit was quite amusing.\nThe second play Comes a Cropper was\nespecially written for the company Monstrous Regiment\u2014as a kind of sequel\nto the previous play. It is set in the\npresent day and once more people are\nstranded on a desert island\u2014only seven\nthis time though. Predictably, released\nfrom the law of a country, the men once\nmore try to intimidate the women into\nletting them take charge.\nThis play is amusing at first\u2014a few of\nthe characters are modern stereotypes\nbut again the play loses interest towards\nto improve her footwear. And so on.\nThe square (but not, thankfully, a full\nphysics fresher) Moranis grows cooler as\ntime goes by under Steve's influence and\nComes\nthe end and the ending is very contrived,\nmerely used as an escape mechanism,\nand really rather spoils the play\u2014had\nthere been any sympathy left for it by\nthen!\nThese plays were really rather\ndisappointing as the ideas were good and\ncould, I feel, have been developed better.\nThe plays are showing at the Battersea\nArts Centre. The box office is on 071-223\n2223.\nJ LW. \u2014Films\n\u2014Comics/Graphics\n\u2014Theatre\nREVIEWS\nSteve grows reciprocally more stable.\nRick learns to dance the merengue (yes\nwe thought you ate it too) and gives big\nhap pies all round.\nBy the end of the film everybody is in\nlove with the right people and Steve has\nturned over a new leaf (maybe). Rick has\nmanaged to beat some-one up for no\nparticularly good reason (most enjoyable).\nEverything is fluffy bunnies all round (we\ndon't feel we have denied you the\nsurprise of the ending).\nIn conclusion : This film offers the\nchance to see Steve Martin acting the\nrole he does best (although not at his\nfunniest), Rick Moranis in a new role (ie.\nnot a card-carrying nerd) and a turtle\ndoing what turtles do (no martial arts\ninvolved). Light to the extreme, well-sectioned (split with nice little captions),\nforgettable and happy happy happy\nhappy happy.\nSee it if you've got a spare afternoon (it\nbeats lectures).\nThe Amazing Flying Gerbil Machine\nThe Complete\nSpiderman\ni Happy Memories. In my post Beano\nI and pre-Dr. Who days Marvel UK's 'Spider Man comic was one of my main delights in a week of tables reciting\nand story writing. Nowadays those eyes\nof mine prefer X men, a break from the\ntoil of an English Degree. It's nice to see\nMarvel UK return to the Spidey reprint\nfold after the success of the UK originated\nKnights Of Pendragon and Strip (both\nwell worth a look, especially since\nKnights is now a regular monthly title).\nHow things have changed. Peter Parker\n(the Spectacular Spider Man) is now\nmarried to his old flame Mary Jane\nWatson. His Aunt May appears to be in\nthe throes of geriatric love and J. Jonah\nJameson doesn'town the Bugle anymore.\nThis reprint book actually incorporates\n4 US issues, one each from Amazing\nSpider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, Web\nof (you guessed it) Spider-Man and the\ntwo and a half million selling, Todd\nMcFarlane written/ drawn/ inked, new\nSpider-Man. At \u00a3 1 . 7 5 an issue it\nrepresents a considerable saving on\nbuying all the US books separately (I know, I checked in Mega-City), and the\nprint quality is better than some of the\noriginals.\nAs for the stories, well, the writers are\nno Chris Claremounts, but the art is\npretty good and the storylines interesting.\nEnough to keep any comic fan, with a liking for super-types, happy. Well worth\na trip to the local Newsagents for.\n(How about a Mutants' combines reprint\nbook now, Marvel UK?)\nPendragon.\n\n"
