    "content": "10 FELIX MARPLE S' MAN BUCHANAN RIDES AGAIN Two things stood out very clearly after the speech given by\nProfessor Buchanan at Imperial College last Thursday. The motor\ncar is going to have a great future in this country, and that, this\nbeing so, we shall be in the devil of a mess in a comparatively short\ntime!\nProfessor Buchanan, who has had no less than six articles about\nhim or his work in two of last Sunday's papers, said that we will\neither have to fix the amount of traffic in an area, or the place will\nbecome a\" Motor Slum''\u2014like Exhibition Road or Prince Consort\nRoad. We need a thriving Motor Car industry for our economy,\nand since we will have about 40,000,000 cars on the road before the\nend of the century, we seem to be between the devil and the deep blue\n\" steel\" sea.\nMr. Marples, that most overworked of Ministers, on perceiving\nthe problem and receiving a mass of conflicting advice (build roads,\nban cars, double public transport, ban people) almost came to the\nconclusion that towns and cities were completely finished, so we had\nbest start all over again. Eventually he asked one man, Professor\nBuchanan, to produce a report. On a tight budget, Professor\nBuchanan chose his team almost entirely from outside the civil ser-vice, and produced a long-awaited report.\nThe first chapter was to clear and death_ To counteract this BEYOND THE BISHOP OF WOOLWICH or The Godless Ones\nThe term Scientific Humanism,\nlike Christianity, covers a multitude of sins, it is really a blanket\nterm for an agnostic, rationalist\nconcern for nor ali ty, and human\nwelfare, which acknowledges the\ncontribution that scientific outlook\nand method can make in these\nfields. And that's very probably\nclose to your outlook.\nLast term guest speakers of the\nHuxley Society discussed Morality\nwithout God, the ethics of Advertising (and trading stamps and\nplanned obsolescence) Religious\nBelief and the Scientific Outlook,\nand jointly with I.C.C. N.D. the\nEthics of Unilaterism.\nThis term's first guest will probably be a speaker f tom the Abortion Law Reform Association,\nand the wider subject of euthanasia will probably attract discus-sion. Perhaps these concepts\nmake you shudder; there's strong\ndivision within Humanism and\nit needs debate by those of\nall opinions to clarify it. So if\nyou don't go to church and can\npass a whole day without feeling\nthe nearness of God don't repent,\ncome to the first meeting! The\nuncommitted will have a chance\nto tell a Humanist Research\nGroup what impression Humanism makes on them, and the more\nthinkers we get, the more original\nthought will emerge.\nBUCHANAN\nby HUSSELL\naway misconceptions and reveal\nthe problem as it really stands;\nthere appeared to be no satisfactory alternative to the motor-car. The problem could be divided into two general cat ago ries; Firstly accessibility, the free and\nquick circulation of traffic and the\npossibility of stopping when you\nreach your destination. Secondly\n\u2014the impact on the environment\nof the motor-car, which includes\nanxiety, noise, fumes, vibration,\ndanger, most towns will have ring\nroads and pedestrian centres.\nThe London area remains a problem and Piccadilly Circus just\na big, round, black question mark.\nBefore I finish I will leave my\nreaders with this thought. If, in\nthe next ten years, the traffic\ndoubles, as predicted, and resources do not, as predicted, and\nvery little is done as predicted,\nwhat will we have left?\u2014The\nBuchanan Report.\nTORIES\nREPLYTO YOUR COST\nA letter of considerable length\nhas been received from the Ministry of Pensions; this is in reply to\none sent after last terms Union\nmeeting expressing dissatisfaction\nwith the lot Of the student.

    "content": "FELIX HIGH TREASON LEADS\nTO LOW TRICKS\nIn March this year, the cultural\ndepartment in the Iraqi Embassy\nin London sent a circular to all\nIraqi Government scholars in this\ncountry relating to the events of\nthe 8th February, 1963, in Iraq.\nThe circular included some direct\nand indirect threats ordering students to withdraw from the\n\" Iraqi Students Society in the\nU.K.\" and accused the Society of\n\" high treason.\" A month later,\ntwo Iraqui students lost their\nscholarships and in September\nthe number rose to 8 and now it\nstands at 9. Seven of these stu-dens are studying in London and\ntwo in Cardiff. All these students are members of the I.S. S. With time, the financial position of the expelled students deteriorated and their studies were\nlargely disturbed. This was particularly so with Mr. F. Jalal\n(married with two children) of\nL.S.E. It was almost the same\nfor me, were it not for the fact\nthat I received help from the\nI.S. S. and the College.\nFinancial Support\nThe scholarships must be rein-stated. Meanwhile British students are asked to give whatever\npossible moral and financial support they can.\nIraqi Government officials in\nBaghdad and London gave no\nreason for the expulsion, but the\nparticipation of the students in\n\" political agitation.\"\nAll that in fact happened was\nthat after the coup d 'etat on the\n8th February, out of their worry\nabout their families and friends\nat home, five hundred students\npublicly condemned all reported\natrocities. The result was the expulsion of the members of the\nI.S. S, The students concerned raised\ntheir problem with a number of\nofficials in em bass v but they were\nfaced with insults\u2014in certain\ncases\u2014and with complete indifference in others, Meanwhile the\nexpelled students started to face\nthe gravest of problems for they\nbad no other means of living and\ncontinuing their studies but their\ngrants. The I.S. S. on its part also\nraised the question with the embassy and the colleges concerned\nand started a campaign to give\nmoral and financial to these\nstudents.\nMonstrous Situation\nSurely it is a monstrous situation to be faced and I trust our\nfriends appreciate this. I suggest\nthat any form of protest, especially from the students' unions of\nthe colleges is an active way of\naverting bad decisions on the part\nof the Iraqi embassy and govern-ment.\nI suggest that any financial and\nmoral support the British students can give to the expelled\nstudents is very much needed. A fund was started by the I.S. S. to\ngive financial support to the\nIraqi students. Through this,\nBritish, colleagues can demonstrate their appreciation of the\ngravity of the situation.\nThe I.C. administration helped\nin my case but there are others\nand it is a question of maintaining nine students academically\nand materially.\nThe case surely is dependent\non time but as time goes the case\nis becoming very difficult and\ngraver still.\nZ.M. ABDUL HADI, 2 E,E. Jazz News Inspired by their successes in\nthe U.L. U. Jazz Competition in\nDecember, the Jazz Club started\na fortnightly series cf South Side\nStomps last Wednestday. More\nthan 250 people feeling the need\nfor a spring fling made the scene,\nserved hot by the Kensington\nCity Stampers and cool by the\nClive Heath Quartet.\nThe next Stomp will be on\nWednesday Jan. 29th, and Twitch\naddicts will be pleased to know\nthat \" The Shadies\" will be ap-pea ring, together with the\nStampers. The third Stomp will\noffer a unique opportunity to hear\nthe I.C. Big Band. This will be\nthe first time that the band has\nplayed at the College, so don't miss it. Variety will be the keynote of the South Side Stomps, so\ncome along, and whether you\nshake, twist, jive or just listen,\nyou will definitely banish those\nmid-week blues.\nRIMSHOT\nWHY FELIX Perhaps from the Latin: \u2014Felix\nqui pot u it re rum co qu osce re causa s. Happy are they who can discover the cause of things.\nAN OPEN INVITATION The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the\nMidland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those\nwho are older and already established. The Midland Bank is interested in YOU \u2014 and all young people like you. You would find a bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of paying bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of\nyour expenditure.\nMidland Bank THE GO-AHEAD BANK FOR- GO-AHEAD PEOPLE\n\n"

Tony Berry' s article is informative and well written, but short stories and the editorial are disappointing. It is a pity that\" Phoenix\" still tends to ape the way-out Arts rather than to produce thought worthy of a scientific institution. Verdict: much improved and worthy of support. Further, Felix congratulates all those responsible for the magazine's most effective publicity, which, however, was so subtle that few knew that it was \" Phoenix\" being advertised.

    "content": "6 FELIX PREVENTION IS BETTER\nTHAN CURE\" If you don't want your wallet\nstolen, don't leave it lying around\nin coats or jackets.\" Time and\nagain Jock Henry, the Chief\nSecurity Officer has been round\nthe buildings of the College in\nperson with this rather obvious\nwarning to people working in\nlabs, and offices. A man of less\nStirling character might have been\nseduced by the opportunities for\nlarceny to be found; and yet despite him people go Im losing\nmoney in just this way and wonder why they get short shrift from\nSecurity. At the beginning of this\nterm, three cases were pending,\ntwo thefts of wallets and one of a handbag, left in a toilet.\nBut in addition, there was a coat and a typewriter stolen way\nback last term, and a Jazz Club\ntrumpet worth thirty-two pounds.\nThis sort of thing goes to the\npolice and Security hears no more\nof it. The coat's owner got back\none bunch of keys lost on the\nTube, and heard nothing from\nthe police at all.\nThefts from Beit are right\ndown, but this is due to prevention (by locking of doors), not\ncure; chances of recovery of anything but empty wallets are about\nnil, and the only safeguard is as\nalways: carry it with you, or lock\nit up. Even in the lab. ideals of the\ndisinterested search for truth get\nburied under baser motives.\nA STUDENT'S GUIDE TO\nINSURANCE Why is Insurance necessary for\ni student? In an institution like\nImperial College where theft and\n\" mysterious losses \" occur frequently a student can protect\nhimself against financial loss by\ninsuring his possessions. What can\nbe insured? Everything. Motor\nCars, Scooters, Typewriters,\nRadios, bicycles, cameras, gram o phones, tape recorders, watches,\nsports gear, clothes, life and limb,\nyou name it and someone will\ninsure it.\nHow does a student obtain in-sur ance? He can go directly to one of the\nlarge insurance companies, or deal\nthrough an insurance broker. A student is likely to get a better\ndeal from a broker who deals with\nall the large insurance companies\nand is in a better position to\nobtain a policy to suit a student's special needs and pocket.\nHow much does it cost? Firstly\nit is no more expensive to insure\nthrough a broker because he takes\nhis commission from the insurance company. Also brokers often\noffer reduced rates to students,\nfrequently as much as five or ten\nper cent. The insurance of per-purely nominal. \u00a31 \u2014 30s. per\nson al items (sports gear etc.) is\nannum.\nTHE MARGATE\nCONFERENCE\nAfter the N.U.S. council meeting at Margate last November the\nN.U.S. secretary of U.C., Mike\nFreedman was interviewed to get\na more personal view of this body\nwhich represents some 218,000\nstudents in this country.\nMike\u2014what has N.U.S. ta say\nabout the withdrawal of grants\nfrom Iraqi students in this\ncountry\"?\n\u2014our motion urged immediate\nreinstatement of grants to these\nstudents and called for constituent\nunion financial and moral support.\nAnd on Apartheid ?\n\u2014we had a very practical resolution calling for more scholarships for South Africans in this\ncountry who had been discriminated against in South Africa. We\ncalled for closest co-operation\nwith SACHED.\nDid Council Discuss Robbins ?\n\u201447 emergency motions were\ntabled on the Robbins Report and\nwe had a half day discussion followed by an 84 paragraph state-ment. We hope to debate the\nReport in April at Swansea.\nN.U.S. was, in fact, asked by the\nRobbins Committee to submit\nevidence, which it did.\nWhat about Student Grants ?\n\u2014N.U.S. has been campaigning\nfor the abolition of the means\ntest in student grants.

What is the point\nof putting up posters advertising\nyour society's forthcoming events\nif they (the posters) are 'to be\nimmediately ob scurr ed by the\ngrinning features of an I.C. \"man\" and his bird(s) at some\nlong-forgotten function?

Dear Sir,\nThere is no doubt that this is a lively and provocative newspaper.\nI feel that the new face of Felix\nhas done much to stimulate a wider interest in Union affairs,\nand I would certainly be among\nthe first to applaud any contrib u tion, however slight, to combat\nthe apathetic attitude of the average student towards the Union.\nFour-fifths\" of\ntop civil servants\ntake THE TIMES\n/\nv So only this: these particular Top People must keep themselves fully and widely informed. They must be aware\nnot only of happenings in their particular field, but of discussion and comment on questions of the day, international\nnews, politics and the arts. For all this, they turn to The Times. You may not want to be a top civil servant: lots of people\ndon't. But the same is true of top dons, top businessmen, top\npoliticians. Whatever kind of top person you hope to be, it's not too early to get in training now by taking THE TIMES\nregularly. Especially since, as a student, you're entitled to it\nat half price: ask your newsagent or write to THE TIMES\nSubscription Manager.\nThe exact figure is85%. We are aware that this is a little more than\nfour-fifths: please do not write to point this out. Do write, however, if\nyou would be interested in an account of the research which produced\nthese and many other revealing figures. Who are Top People? What do\nthey think on the important issues of the day? Write to The Times\n(Department SP), Printing House Square, London EC4.\nAnother healthy feature of your\nnewspaper is the obvious enthusiasm with which the Felix staff\nhave set about their task of reporting news items, and presenting\nthe other features which make up\nyour newspaper.\nHowever, I feel that, at times,\nlast term, the actual standard of\nreporting was poor, it being both\nchildish and irresponsible. Although I would hesitate to claim\nthat there was actual distortion of\nfact, all too often, the presentation was prejudiced without justification. Surely it is an Insult\nto a University student's intelligence to suppose that what he\nwants is shallow sensationalism.\nLet's have a newspaper with more\nconstructive reading matter with\nrather less of the meaningless\nheadlines, and rather less, also, of\nmaterial of a superficial character.\nA case in point was the front\npage story in the last issue of\nFelix dealing with the Debating\nSociety. This article contained\nnothing constructive and made\nlittle attempt to recognise any\nefforts which are, in fact, being\nmade to set the Society on its feet\nagain.\nIt is fallacious to argue, as you\ndo, that the present form of Felix\nshould be maintained since it sells.\nThe only reason that Felix sells\nis because the publicity is first-rate. Who, of the South Side res i dents, can resist the dynamic\nsaleswoman ship to wM ch they\nare subjected every other Tuesday\nevening!\nFelix will still sell, provided the\nexcellent publicity arrangements\nare maintained, even if the articles\nare of a greater length, with a more searching, mature treatment,\ntreatment.\nThe editorials in the later issues\nof Felix last term commanded the\nrespect they deserved. Why cannot this be extended throughout\nFelix so that it becomes a newspaper with a certain amount of\ndignity and one of which the College can be proud.\nYours\nGOPAL SRINTVASSEN\nThere were, I thought, a number of constructive criticisms of\nthe Debating Society in my article,\nespecially concerning the nature\nof the motions, and the desirability of introducing outside\nspeakers.

Then turn to the\nsports page.\nSACHED\nThe collection raised \u00a3148 18s.5d.; the Executive would like to\nthank all staff and students who\ncontributed so generously.\nPIANO LESS Dear Sir,\nThe College prides itself on the\nsupport which it gives to the many\nsides of student activity, and in\ngeneral it has good reason. Few\nactivities with any following are\nnot catered for, however, the college has fallen sadly behind demand in the provision of good\npianos and practicing facilities.\nIt is true that there are pianos\nlittered around in such intelligent\nplaces as the South Side upper\nlounge, the Union staircase and\namong the debris of the Concert\nhall stage, but these do nothing to\nhelp the situation. The top Refectory boasts a piano which on\na good day might fetch 30/- at a fumble sale. The Jazz Club piano\nis available, understandably, only\nto members of the club. Where,\nthen, can nan-jazz pianists pra c tice!\nThe one place where this is possible (when no-one else is using it\nand after 5.30 p.m.)178 Queensgate. And even to practice here\nrequires three signatures and the\nloan of a key from the Union\nsecurity guards. The need for at\nleast a second practicing room\nwith a good piano is immediate\nand urgent, particularly since\nnone of the new buildings have\ndone anything at all in this dire c tion.\nWhen the College is accused of\ncatering only for Science and\nSport, it is in such cases as this\nthat the accusations are justified.\nYours etc.,\nERIC TWINAME\nPARKING Dear Sir,\nAs a resident of Southside, I was disturbed to see the private\nroad outside our Hall cluttered up\nwith motor cars one night last\nweek. Ho Ho 1 thought, it's a monster outbreak by students defying the no-parking ban imposed\nlast term. I thought that I saw\ntraffic wardens swarming, but they\nwere chauffeurs in peaked caps,\nand surely students don't drive\nRolls Royces, Bentleys and a Lambretta scooter (Blue and\nGrotty Grey). And all those\npeople were going into the Lybian\nEmbassy thing.\nGrotl I thought. Why should\nit be per miss able for them to park\ntheir cars in our private road!\nCars look ugly there at any time;\nRolls Royce or Roll-over Bentley\nor Bent-tin.\nAesthetically yours,\nYog.\nFANCY THAT When the Clerk to the Halls of\nResidence moved to Southside\ntwo offices were left vacant, with\nbut one outer door.

This is obvious to an yone with his eyes open, but among the pent house dwellers in SouthSide, there are men\nwho would change this and provide a system\nbased on Oxbridge, where sport and social activities would centre round each individual hall of residence. Each hall would have\nits boat club and its debating society, and\neach warden would have much more power. Our Union exists solely for the purpose of the students of Imperial College and we are the people to run it as we see fit. Each\nyear the penthouse dwellers try their tactics on a new President and Council and each year so far they have been thwarted. Let us hope this situation will continue, because\notherwise our Union will become a replica of UL U, where the warden does as he likes and\nthe Union is converted into flats for his convenience. THE WORKING PARTY. By now everyone must. have seen the large red poster advertising the President's new committee to look into the running of Union affairs. Ostensibly, this committee was formed to relieve the strain on the hardworking I.G, Executive, but an interesting point is that three of the most overworked of the five Exec, members s it on the new committee, two by\nnecessity, and one by his own planning. The remaining three members w^ re very suitably chosen, and Mr. Massey in particular is to be congratulated on his nomination of Mr. P reece. I hope that all the stirrers and\ncomplainers that I have heard so often talking big in the Union will come forward and\ntell their ideas to the new committee and\nuse the uncommon chance given to them by a President who has realised that there are others besides Council who can have in tell i gent ideas about running the Union. OPPOSITION. In these days when Felix is selling so well, a certain would be literary man, who did not succeed too well in his efforts for that newspaper or for an IC\nCarnival recently, has tried another idea. He has persuaded the Electrical Engineering Department via our old friend Dr. Good lad to pay for the production of two news; sheets. Firstly, a two-page departmental newsletter which would be included in Felix and would feature each college department in turn, and, secondly, a newsletter for internal circulation in the E.E. Dept. The first idea is not unreasonable, but the production of pirate efforts like the second I have\nmentioned and with external sources of re venue should be discouraged.

    "content": "4 FELIX EDITORIAL\" THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS \"\nAn average member of the Union was recently asked what\nhe thought the Executive had achieved this year: after a moment's silence he replied, \" Well, you certainly have to think, don't you ?\"\nand then a few moments later added :\n\" He's a nice sort of chap, anyway.\" Indeed, one may well ask\nwhat they have achieved ; what is there in this Union, apart from\nour own glorious complacency, on which we can lavish praise. Now\nwe have the answer; in President Watson's own words, \" The best\nthing the Union has done this year.\"\nThe establishment of a Working Party is in theory an excellent\nidea ; in practice its progress will have many pitfalls, and it will\nrequire a firm chairman to end the course with a positive result.\nThe strong-individual prejudices to be overcome will require vigorous\nleadership even at the risk of treading on a few toes. So far a considerable programme has been covered and one can only hope that\nits proposals will not be discarded by some of the less far-seeing\nmembers of Council. One of the iT proposals is to remove Council's\" dead wood \" but doubtless it will be the \" dead wood \" which will\nresist most determined ly. Having been passed by Council, if indeed\nthey are, they will then have to be accepted at two Union Meetings.\nThis part of their passage should not be fraught with the perils faced\nin T Jo unc il. It is claimed that not enough people speak at Union,'\nmeetings, but at least they do not query and bau lk just for the sake\nof it.\nWANTED : A FULL TIME TYPIST\nPerhaps the most useful thing the Working Party could do would\nbe to recommend that the Union employ a full time secretary solely\nfor the use of Union Officials and organisers. At present one has\nto enlist secretaries, girl friends, or just anyone who can type for\nthe purpose of putting things legibly on to paper. Felix itself uses\nmany typing hours a week and it is sometimes a full-time job enlisting help. The alternative of one-finger-do-it-yourself is to say\nthe least uns at i factory. Were this idea put into practice then the\npresent executive could shout from the rooftops that they had made\nsome real extra contribution to the lot of the student.\nMany congratulations to the President for his forethought in\nforming the Working Party, but the hardest part has yet to come.\nRESPONSIBLE TO WHOM? The Editor of the Daily Worker last week raised an interesting\npoint; to whom should an editor be responsible ? At Imperial he\nis directly responsible to the Felix board, which is of course a highly\nreasonable arrangement, for no student should be given absolute\npower. However, Who is to sit on this board ? At present this does\nnot appear to be clearly defined, but the five central figures are the\nUnion Executive. Mr. Mathews suggested that this was in fact undesirable, iof it gave power-to those who already had it; carrying this\nline of argument even further, the executive have complete power\nat I.C. in that they, can silence their most effective critic.\nThis year the executive have on the whole been co-operative,\nbut there have been occasions when criticism of the Unions has been\ntaken up at board meetings instead of in the columns of the Newspaper for all to see. .If the executive should be taking some line\nwith which Felix disagrees, it is only too easy for them to find someone else to toe the line.\nSurely it would be far better to have on the Felix board no\nmore than one member of the ex cut ive, and the remainder impartial\nbut responsible Union members ; the Chairman of the ACC, RC C and SCC should be on it, as indeed they already are, but the rest\nshould be persons with no particular line to sell or axe to grind.\nIt becomes a farce when each person on the board tries to plug his\nown particular field. It is astonishing how confined an outlook can\nbecome in the higher levels of bureaucracy in this Union ; the editor's job becomes one of constantly trying to retain his objectivity and\nignore futile suggestions from a sincere but misguided minority. Two\nyears ago the President of the Union made a costly mistake over the\nprinting of Felix ; had he been trying to sell his idea to a separate\ncommittee instead of to his own executive, the Union might have\nbeen spared almost three hundred pound's. Mr. Mathews, in his general studies lecture, claimed there was\nno freedom of the press ; perhaps the student press is not quite so\nfree as it appears either, and it may be time that the Felix board\nre-examined its own composition.\nTHE LITERARY STANDARD\nElated Guildsman Bishop was\nlast week telling how his poem,\nturned down three years ago by\nhis school magazine, was now in\nprint in PHOENIX.\nGuilds now have two poets on\ntheir exec uti vp; the Boomalaka\nt nay yet scan.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE OF SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY\nThe Governing Body of the Imperial College of Science and\nTechnology has elected its Chairman, Sir Roger Makins, G.C.B., G.C.M.G., D. C.L., Hon.M.I.C.E. to Fellowship of the College.\nMr. Edward Heath was recently quoted as attributing the\nsudden flourishing of the cor-douro y velvet trade to the popularity of the Beatles. Whatever\nthe reason the fact remains that\n\" cord\" is rapidly becoming\nvery popular for all kinds of\nclothes and any girl who has\nChristmas gifts of money as yet\nun spent or wants to blue some\nof her grant on a new coat, dress\nor suit need look no further when\ndeciding On fabric. Cordouroy\nis smart, warm and does not\nstretch or \" seat\" like so many\ntweeds, which makes it ideal also\nfor an everyday skirt for wearing\nto lectures. And home dressmakers will find it sold by the\nyard in many exciting colours, by\nseveral of the large West End\nstores \u2014 personal favourites:\ncherry red, mustard and sap hire. Prices are very reasonable averaging 7/11 per yard for dress\nweight and 9/11 for suit or skirt\nweight material, while some shops\nare stocking a shower proof version at 13/11 per yd. These comparatively low prices are ref lec ted, too, in the cost of ready-to-wear corduroy clothes, of which a large selection is gradually appearing in shops as sale stock is\ncleared.\nBoots\nHigh boots are, of course, high\nfashion, but make sure when\nbuying them that their leather is\nsoft and pliable otherwise it will\nlead to concertina creases and\nsplitting round the ankles.

LOSING\nCONTROL?\nWORKING PARTY FORMED\nThe\"Worker's\" Editor\nMr. George Mathews, on a visit to I.C. last week, was exclusively\ninterviewed by a Felix reporter and questioned on his views on the\nstudent press. He emphasised the responsibility of a newspaper, and\nsaid it should actively encourage greater student representation to\nthe governing bodies. He did not envisage, he said, a University\nrun by students, but one where a REPONSIBLE body had considerable say in its administration.\nThe college newspaper should not have an Editor completely\nindependent, but rather responsible to an editorial board. This board\nhe thought should not consist of the same persons on College Council,\nbut of impartial and responsible observers. If possible it should run\nwith no advertising, but with Felix receiving two-thirds of its revenue\nfrom this source, he agreed that it was likely to be impractical. In\nshort, the newspaper should stimulate interest in all aspects of College\nlife.\nA report of Mr. Mathew's lecture appears elsewhere in this\nIssue.\nRachmanism\nA working party has been set up by Council to investigate the\nrunning of the Union. It was felt that the work of the executive\nhad grown so much that there was a danger of them losing control,\nparticularly in the newly-opened South Side. Also the number of\ncommittees that the President has to attend has grown disp roporT tion ably with the growth of the College.\nThe working party consists of Dave Watson, the President who\ndiscovered the problems, Les Massey, the Secretary, John Preece,\nlast year's Secretary, Bob Shroter, President of C.&G. Union, Roger\nHenson, Chairman of R.C. C., and Norman Price.\nIf any major changes are to take place they must be discussed\nby Council and passed by two consecutive Union meetings. This\nmeans that the working party's recommendations must be finalised\nwithin the next week or two if they are to be acted upon this year.\nThe working party is at the moment (15th January) still a long\nway from coming to any unanimous decisions, but their recommendations will almost certainly include the following :\n1. The creation of a post of\nVice (or Deputy) President who\nwill be responsible for house\naffairs, i.e. staff, furnishings, bar,\nrefectories.\n2. The creation of a post of\nHalls Representative to sit on\nCouncil.\n3. The removal of three of the\nsix ordinary Council members\nwho have no special responsibility. It has been brought. to the\nnotice of the College Administration that there are certain persons\noperating in the London area who\ntry to induce prospective tenants\nof property to part with considerable sums of money for rent in\nadvance or as deposits against\ndamages and dilapidation s. Thereafter tenants have been unable to\ncontact the so-called landlords\nand obtain a refund of these de-posits.\nMembers of the College who\nare seeking accommodation, and\nFORTHCOMING EVENTS\nWednesday, 22nd January\nU.L.

DAVIES,\nSecretary.\nPARTY POLITICAL\nWith the approach of General\nElections and the political campaigners already on the move,\nFelix will be printing a series of\nthree articles, one from each\nparty. The first, with Mr. Grimmond at I.C., in the near future,\nis from the Liberal Party and appears in this issue. The others are\nplanned for later in the term.\nTHE RECTOR IN INDIA\nAt the invitation of the Indian\nGovernment and as a member of\nthe Reviewing Committee of the\nIndian Council of Scientific and\nIndustrial Research the Rector is\nvisiting India for about six weeks\nfrom the 22nd January, 1964.\nWhile he is away Professor P.M.S. Blackett, F.R.S., as ProRector, will act as head of the\nCollege.\nAt the moment there is disagreement as to whether the Vice\n(or Deputy) President shall have a house committee consisting of one\nmember for Beit and one for\nSouth Side to help him, and if\nthey exist, how they shall be\nelected. There is also doubt about\nwhat to call this person; the Presidents of the constituent colleges\n(Vice-Presidents of I.C.) feel that\nif they lose this secondary title\nit will diminish the influence of\nthe constituent colleges.\nThjs is not the first time that\nsome of these suggestions have\nbeen made. In January '62, Si\nLyle, then President of the Union,\nsuggested the formation of posts\nof Deputy President and Halls\nRepresentative and the setting up\nof a house committee.\nThree or four years ago, if a student had a problem about\nUnion facilities he could call in at\nthe Union office and find someone\nwho could help him, but now one\nrarely sees the executive who always seem to be at a meeting\nor \" not about\" I feel that the\ncreation of a Vice-President whose\njob it is to be available and\nsee that Beit and South Side run\nsmoothly would again create an\ninterest in the Union because people would feel that someone would\ntake some notice of their comments and complaints. I think\nthat having a person responsible\nfor each building might increase\nthis but an efficient Vice-President\nmight well be able to do the Job\nsingle-handed.\nR.M.

Two thousand leaflets\nand over 200 posters advertised a series of meetings intended to\nshow how the Marxist holds the\nkey to many questions, political,\neconomic and cultural, by not\nmerely asking How? but Why?\nWhy do people compete instead\nof cooperate, produce great works\nof art and run countries?\nThe General Studies lecture by\nGeorge Mathews, Editor of the\nGRACE\nDaily Worker brought the audience face to face with the realities\nof the Press-Lords' monopoly\nover our minds.

    "content": "FELIX7 LIBERALISM\nby CHRISTOPHER LAYTON In different ways, all three political parties are now talking about\nmodernising Britain. Their success will depend on two things\u2014\nwhether they can give the economy a new dynamic, and whether they\ncan reshape our machinery of Government to suit modern needs.\nThe two are linked. Though growth depends on many things\noutside administration\u2014like promoting competition and efficiency'\u2014\nthe poor state of industrial confidence and investment is the direct\nconsequence of the Government's failure to give sustained growth\ntop priority. And that in turn has sprung from the failure to plan\nahead and perceive that every government objective\u2014schools, homes,\naid, even the strength of sterling\u2014depends on sustained growth.\nNeddy\nThe setting up of Neddy is a first step. Planning has become\nan O.K. word'even in Tory c ir cles. Industry now accepts that\nthe Government should do what\nevery major firm does\u2014think\nahead.\nBut Neddy has shortcomings.\nMany of Neddy's excellent ideas,\nfrom redundancy to regionalism,\nare not accepted by the Government. And no-one really knows\nwhat authority they have. There\nis no sign whatever that Mr.\nMarples or Sir Keith Joseph is\ntaking any notice whatever of\nNeddy's recommendations. Indeed Dr. Beeching's proposals\nwould accelerate a drift to the\nManchester-London coffin which\nNeddy hopes to stop.\nA Minister for Expansion\nTo put this right requires\nbroader changes than the mere\nmanufacture of new Ministries.\nPerhaps, indeed, there are too\nmany already. There is far too\nlittle long-term thinking or planning and too much petty intervention in daily life.\nThe Liberal Party's proposals\nfor the reform of administration\nare designed to try to put this\nright.\nWe have suggested, first, that\nthe economic staff of Neddy\nshould be promoted and placed\nunder a Minister, whom we call\nthe Minister for Expansion. This\nMinister would have real power.\nThe Treasury and Board of Trade\nwould take guidance from him.\nmates are too narrow and specialised to be useful.\nThe Minister would become\nChairman of the existing Council\nof Neddy, where industry and\nunions are represented. In the\nformation of an effective incomes\npolicy the Council plainly has a key part to play. Equally, the\nnew sub-committees of Neddy are\ncrucial. Here the detail of the\nplan can be put together, and the\nplanners can educate industry to\nthe implications of expansion.\nResponsibility\nBut ultimate responsibility for\nthe plan must rest with the\nGovernment, and with a specific\nMinister. Only a government\nrepresentative can go to an individual industry and tell it with\nconviction that Government\npolicy will be designed to achieve\ncertain goals. It is to Parliament,\nnot to the Council of employers\nand unions, that the Government\nthe Labour Party, Liberals seek\nto de central is e the detailed execution of planning from Whitehall.\nOur Town Clerk, struggling to get\na factory or even to get a decision\non the placing of a kerbs tone, has not only to cope with several\ndifferent ministries but to press\nfor a decision at several levels of\ngovernment \u2014 borough, county\nand Whitehall itself. There is too\nlittle planning and too much red-tape.\nIn our conception central government must lay down the broad\nlines of economic policy and guide\nresources to the areas which need\ndevelopment.\nBut elected regional councils\nshould draw up plans for their\nown regions and execute them\u2014\nthrough development corporations\nof their own, for instance, which\nwould finance new industries and\nhousing consortia. In the siting\nBIOGRAPHICAL\nThe Hon. Christopher Layton, son of Lord Layton, the Liberal\nPeer, lost the 1962 Chippenham by-election by only 1,500 votes while\npushing the Labour candidate into third place. He is personal executive to Mr. Grimond, and also the Liberal Party spokesman on\nEconomic Affairs. Educated at Oundle and Cambridge he has\nserved in industry with ICI and also in Fleet Street with \" The\nEconomist.\"\nmust finally answer for the plan.\nAnother suggestion is that the\ntop planning body should be in\nthe Prime Minister's office. This\nwould be to go for a presidential\nsystem with a vengeance. I believe\nTWO KINDS OF\nConservative policies of course\nhave never been part of a thought\nout design for society or the\neconomy; they are improvisations.\nBut the tendency to go off in all\ndirections is enhanced by weaknesses in our Government ma-chin e. Within , the Cabinet,\nMinisters are all too often defending departmental interests. And\nyou do not have to be in the\nCabinet to find this out. If you\nare a local government official\nstruggling to get a new factory for\nyour town you may be -asking the\nBoard of Trade for a Licence\n'while the Minister of Transport\nis busy cutting off the branch line\nand the Ministry of Housing &\nLocal Government is failing to\nprovide the money for the new\nhouses you need. In economic\npolicy itself, while the Board of\nTrade is responsible\u2014in pedantic\ndetail\u2014for the siting of new factories and for development areas,\nthe Treasury has been responsible\n(with considerable caution) for\nthe fiscal measures that would\nencourage new factories ot set up.\nNo one is responsible for the regional policies which Neddy\nrecommends, except, rather\nvaguely, Lord Hailsham in the\nNorth.\nSo, in broad economic matters,\nwould other Ministers. He would\nhave responsibility for the plan,\nfor seeing it was carried out, and,\nabove all, for answering to Parliament.\nThis last responsibility is of\ncrucial importance, for we envisage a much closer working relationship between Parliament\nand the executive on economic\nmatters than exists today. The\nLiberal five-year plan for Britain,\nana one-year plans to implement\nit, would be put to Parliament for\napproval. Like the French\nchamber, Parliament would debate different target '-rates of\ngrowth, with their implications\nfor investment, consumption and\npublic spending.\nEconomic Affairs Committee\nOne of the key all-party standing committees we would like to\nsee set up in the Housedof Commons would be the committee for\neconomic affairs. Its members\nshould work closely with the\nmembers of the economic ministry\nin both the formulation and the\ndevelopment and execution of the\nplan. Five-year budgets would\nenable Members to relate Government spending to the plan. Too\noften today debates on the Estithat the delegation of authority on\nwhich our Cabinet system is based\nis more efficient. But just as the\nGovernment has rightly brought\ndefence policy under a single\nMinister, so economic policy\nmust be brought under one man.\nHow does this conception resemble or differ from the Labour\nParty's? Labour wants a senior\nM!n is ter in charge of economic\nof industry, for example, a total\namount of factory space might\nusefully be allocated to each\nregion, ;but the decision where\nfactories should be placed would\nbe left to the regions themselves.\nSuch decentralisation would make\npossible a real slimming in Whitehall as well as a better division\nof responsibility between broad\nnational policy and execution on\nthe spot.\nUniversities and Research\nThe differences between the two\nphilosophies on the Left can be\nfound again in the instruments of\nplanning. Liberals would solve\nby allowing the market to operate\nbut taxing the benefits of growth\nfor the community. Labour intends to national is e all development land. In science, Liberals\nwould encourage the regions to set\nup their own universities and\nspur on diversity in research.\nPLANNING\nplanning. But so far there are\nfewer signs that Labour is interested in a radical reform of the\ncivil service. And Mr. Wilson is\nevidently anxious to divide responsibility for economic policy\nrather than put one man in\ncharge.\nNor has the Labour Party yet\nshown interest in Parliamentary\ncontrol of planning on economic\npolicy, which we believe to be\ncrucial if it is to work and command informed popular support.\nDecentralisation\nAbove all, in stark contrast with\nLabour would bring university\nresearch under Government con-tro l. Labour still believes that\nthe state must both plan and\nexecute planning decisions. We\nbelieve in a plural society in which\nthe task of government is to hold\nthe ring* and create circumstances\nin which groups and individuals\nserve the common needs.\nHere is one aspect of Liberal\npolicy. It is a key one. It shows\nthat Liberal thinking is forward\nlooking and practical. It adds to\nother Liberal proposals to help\ncreate a modern up-to-date\nsociety.\n\n"
