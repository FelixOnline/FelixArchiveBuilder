    "content": "BackChat\nquestion\nmm *\nreality\nof\nServan Keondjian did not follow the usual\ncareer path for a Physics graduate. After\nleaving Imperial College in 1990, he first\nspent a year working at a small computer\ngames company, and then went on tour as a pianist with a rock band. To mark the end of\nhis first three years out of university, he\nfounded a computer graphics company.\nHowever, you shouldn't get the\nimpression that Servan didn't know what he\nwanted to do. It would, in fact, be more\naccurate to say that he knew what he didn't want to do, which was to head out into the\nworld, BSc in hand, and stumble straight into\na nice, sensible, boring job at a nice, sensible,\nboring company.\nThe company that he founded,\nRenderMorphics, is now at the forefront of a3D graphics revolution which is sweeping the\npersonal computer world. RenderMorphics'\nproduct, called RealityLab, is one of three\nhigh performance 3D graphics systems which\nhave recently appeared on the market (the\nothers being Criterion's RenderWare and\nArgonaut Software's BRender).\nThe Product\nThe best place to start the tale is back here at\nImperial. Servan un enthusiastically recalls\nmemories of his days as an\nundergrad: \"I thought it was\nOK, but I did get quite fed up\nsometimes because it was all\nvery serious and most of the\npeople were pretty serious.\nThat I found was a bit of a drag.\"\nRealityLab sprung from\nwork Servan did in his spare\ntime while at Imperial: \"I wrote a simple 3D system at\nthe end of my first year, and\nreally that's where all this stuff\ncame from.\"\nServan was certain that\nhe wanted to make money out\nof his 3D obsession. He got a job with Magnetic Scrolls, a software company specialising\nin adventure games. After a year there, Servan left because they didn't want to do any 3D stuff. So he joined a band\ninstead.\n\"I don't like working for people, I 've\nalways had a problem with it,\" he explains. \"I didn't even go to any of the Careers Fairs,\nbecause I just wasn't really interested in that.\nI was pretty interested in playing in a band,\nactually. I did that for two years. I did about\n110 gigs, touring all over the country. That\nwas alright, good for a break. And it also\nmeant I could write graphics code during the\nday.\"\nIt was Servan's friend, Kate Seekings,\nwho finally got him to start a company to do\nsomething with his graphics, as she explains:\n\"He kept w hinge ing about wanting to\nstart a company, and every time I saw him he\nhadn't done it. I even bought him a book\nabout how to start your own company, and it\nstill didn't work. So I ended up doing it for\nhim.\"\nSays Servan: \"It was something I really\nwanted to do, but I wasn't sure about exactly\nhow to direct it to begin with. It started off\nwith us going to write a massive 3D game, bu\nit turned out that the 3D was so good that we\ncould make something of that.\"\nServan and Kate pulled in Doug\nRabson, who he had met at Magnetic Scrolls,\nand together the three of them started\nRenderMorphics in Kate's back bedroom.\n\"We set up the company at just about\nthe time we'd finished the first version of\nRealityLab. So we were in the really\nadvantageous position of having a nearly\nfinished product when we started. Most\npeople would set up a company, and get\nventure capital to develop the product. That\nputs them into debt, because it all takes a long time to develop.\"\nThe Marketing\nSo RenderMorphics had their product. The\nproblem was that no-one knew about it. Kate,\nRenderMorphics' sales and marketing\ndirector, leaps in and takes up the story: \"We\ntried to approach key strategic people, and we\nhoped that the word would trickle down, and\nthat's basically what happened.\n\"We made some mistakes initially. We\ndrove all the way to Autodesk in Switzerland\nin a Renault 5 and then they weren't the right\npeople. And we went all the way to Paris to\nsee Microsoft, and saw some guy who tried to\nsell us Windows NT. So that trip was a waste\nof time too.\n\"Then in November last year we did\nour first trip to America. I had to literally\npick the phone and cold call companies, and\nin nine days we saw thirteen different\ncompanies. Our first graphics trade show was\nSIGRAPH last August. When we went to the\nshow we were able to announce relationships\nwith Matrox, Autodesk and Kaleida (an\nApple/IBM consortium). So we arrived with a bit of a bang.\"\nThe key to success at this early stage\nwas not to give up, says Kate: \"We just had to\nbe persistent. I didn't always get to the right\npeople, I'd just phone people up and ask for\ntheir person who was into 3D and talk to\nthem. We also got ourselves a press agency,\nwhich was really expensive but was well\nworth it in America, and we got\nquite a lot of press coverage\nthere.\"\nThe Present\nBig Time: The three founders of RenderMorphics, (from left to right)\nDoug Rabson, Kate Seekings and Servan Keondjian. Photo: Mark Baker\nIn the last twelve months,\ninterest in RealityLab has really\ntaken off.\n\"It's been really hard\nwork, it's just mad,\" says\nServan. \"We can't cope with the\ndemand and everything that\nwe'ie getting at the moment.\nWe still need to expand and get\nmore people. So we're getting\nanother person from Imperial.\"\nThat makes a total of five\nex-Imperial students now\nworking for RenderMorphics.\n\"Imperial must have a FELIX "

Term began with the usual\nhedonism but the revelries of some upset college\ncatering staff. Mergers were proposed and\nImperial College looked set to swell in size. The\nthreat of the college conspiring with other\nUniversities to form a break-away group caused\nmuch discussion.\nFELIX1 QQ6 Panic! Da Vinci's Bar flooded and there were fears that it would be\nunable to open for Freshers' Week. But with an impressive feat of\norganisation the damage was completely repaired within 24 hours.\nFreshers' Week was a typically drunken affair, the only major incident\nbeing a stage charge by over zealous students. Meanwhile St Mary's Hospital Medical School was the focus of a financial scandal. Cyril\nD 'Souza, a cashier at the Medical School, was alleged to have stolen\nover \u00a3650,000 and the case received national news coverage. Back at\nSouth Kensington, commitment to clubs and societies is cited as one\nof the reasons for academic failure. The article prompted an indignant\nresponse from the club highlighted. And Imperial College's compulsive equestrian ites were jumping for joy at the announcement\nof a new prize for a scholarship in horse racing.\nFELIX1 QQ7 It was announced that Imperial College was to acquire a new organ in\nthe form of the National Heart and Lung institute. The merger, due to\ngo ahead within a year, was seen as the first phase of the plan to make\nImperial a medical 'super-school'. Great interest was taken in the\nrevelation that Imperial was one of ten universities possibly planning\nto form a 'superleague'. On a lighter note, the Three Handled Pot\nbelonging to the Royal College of Science Union was stolen in a suspected mascot ry raid. As the two pint pewter pot is not a violate\nmascot it was requested that it be returned. The pot was later located\nin the Royal School of Mines Union office. Rag performed their\nannual tid d ly winking efforts along Oxford Street and raised nearly\n\u00a3400 for Action Aid.\nFELIX1 QQ8 It was revealed that during summer a hacker had broken into Imperial\nCollege's computer network and from there caused disruption to the\nFinnish University network. The hacker, from the United States,\nmanaged to gain access to Imperial's computers via the Internet. The\nRoyal College of Science Union faced eviction following the plans for a new Biomedical Centre at Imperial. Others saw their property\nBomb: Police close roads in potentially explosive drama\nReggie Snatched\nBY ANDY SINHARAY\n\"Reggie Snatched by RCS\nMascotry in surprise early\nmorning raid\" yelled the headline (complete with mis-spelling)\nof the Christmas edition of the\nRoyal College of Science Union's newsletter, 'Broadsheet'. The\nRoyal College of Science Union\nhas removed 'Reggie', a6001bs stone lion, from the Kensington\ncampus of King's College.\nA RCSU source said that the\nraid had taken place on Thursday\nwith remarkable ease, the\nlocation having been known in\nadvance. When asked if they had\nbeen tipped-off by KCL students,\nFELIX was told: \"It wasn't really\na tip-off... the information was\nconned out of them.\"\nApparently, RCS mascot ers were able to get KCL students to\nunwittingly divulge the location\nof the stone mascot, which was\n'liberated' from KCL premises on\nThursday morning, at around\n8.00am. RCS students, posing as\nstonemasons who had come to\nrepair the lion, were let in by\nsecurity staff who took them to be\nlegitimate after they had\ndisplayed an calling card, an\ninvoice and an imitation letter\napparently signed by the KCLSU\npresident. \"We walked away with\nit,\" said the source. \"We were all\nback in time for nine o 'clock\nlectures...six people were required\nto carry [Reggie] and a trolley\ncame in handy.\"\nFELIX has been told that\nReggie has been moved to a' safe house', and that a ransom\ndemand has been made to KCL:\nReggie will be returned, says the\nRCSU, when KCL have sold\n1000 copies of the IC Rag Mag,\nwhich has been banned from\nKing's. According to King's College,\nReggie had been found missing\nlater that Thursday Morning by\nthe Manager at the Bar. \"Imperial\nrung us and said they had [taken\nReggie]\", said Tara Jefferson,\nVice President of the KCLSU, \"It\nwasn'ta very impressive raid, I 've\nseen more ingenuity...it's quite\nwell known that Reggie was\nneeding repairing.\" However, she\nadmitted that the KCL security\nstaff had seen no identification\nfrom the Imperial students that\nmorning and had simply taken\nthem at face value.\nWhen asked about the\nransom she said: \"As far as we're\nconcerned we've had no ransom\ndemands...they seem to have lost\nthe plot of mascot ry.\" She was\nuncertain over whether or not\nthere would be any mascot ry 'reprisals', saying there had been\nlittle interest in Mascotry at\nKCL. \"King's aren't really into\nthat this year,\" she commented.\nfl M FELIX m ne cgi "

Most people in\nIndustry would say 'Hold on, what's the use\nof Modula-2, we don't use it!' We believe the\nmost important thing is for somebody to have\na good coding background, and know how to\nstructure and set out code, which most people\ncan't do very well.

So it's been designed from the\nground up to port very rapidly. So we can\ndrive a PlayStation or a DEC Alpha through\nit, and the API is the same.\"\nServan also sees the Internet as an\nimportant area for the application of 3D graphics technology:\n\"We're all very interested in the\nInternet, and stuff to do with linking 3D and\nthe Internet. 3D is about the best\ncompression scheme you could come up with\nfor images. The World Wide Web is\nexpanding at a phenomenal rate. What things\nlike VRML do is provide a3D extension to\nthat. They're dying to use it from what we've\nseen. Because it's great - you can have a virtual foyer, so that as you connect to some\nbusiness' 2D page, up comes a3D window\nwith a3D entrance hall, and you can wander\naround and look at stuff.

    "content": "^ massing\nThe sixteen choir was founded in\n1977 by Harry Christophers to\nspecialise in the performance of\nchoral works at the extremities of\nthe classical spectrum - from the\nRenaissance and the twentieth\ncentury. Since then the sixteen\nhave expanded their repertoire to\ninclude pieces from the Baroque\nperiod. It is a recording of such a work that forms their latest\nrelease, Bach's mass in B minor.\nBach seems to have\ncomposed this mass and other late\nworks for no apparent reason\nother than to lay down a record of\nhis skill at composition. For many\nreasons, not least its length, the\nwork was unsuitable for liturgical\nuse. Despite this, Bach expended\nmuch energy on the production of\nwhat is arguably his greatest\nchoral work.\nAlthough the idea of a mass\non this scale saw its fruition late in\nhis life, Bach borrowed extensively\nfrom his earlier works; originality\nwas not as much of a major\ncriterion for critical acclaim as it is\ntoday. In composing the B minor\nmass, Bach drew on two main\nsources: a kyrie and gloria\ncomposed in 1733 as a showpiece\nfor a prospective royal patron, and\na sanctus written in 1724 for a Christmas service. Most of the\nremaining movements are\nreworked arias and choruses from\nBach's existing cantatas.\nIt is a matter of contention as\nto the forces Bach envisaged for a performance of the work (in fact\nhe never heard the work\nperformed in its entirety), but\ntoday, for 'authentic' perform-ances, two schools of thought\nprevail: the 'one voice per part'\nadvocates and those who prefer to\nuse a choir of about thirty voices.\nThe new recording by the sixteen\nis of the latter type with twenty six\nvoices in the chorus, five soloists\nand an orchestra of twenty nine\nplayers. Harry Christophers\nproduces a well balanced sound\nfrom them.\nIn terms of interpretation\nthere really isn't much distinction\nbetween this recording and, say,\nJohn Eliot Gardiner's of almost ten\nyears ago; slight variations of\ntempo and dynamics and different\nvoices for the solos being the most\nobvious. At the very least this\nmaintains the high standards\nwhich the sixteen have set in their\nprevious recordings. 0\nThe punk and the princess began\nas a school essay written by the 14\nyear old Gideon Sams. His mother\nfished it out of the bin and it\nbecame 'the punk', a cult novel\nwith a safety pin through its cover,\nwhich sold twenty three thousand\ncopies from the music shops of 70s London.\nThe film is billed as an update\nof Romeo and Juliet in 90s Notting\nHill. (Our very own Queen's Tower\nappears slap in the middle of the\nfinal shot.)\nPunk David spends his time\nshooting pool, strumming his guitar\nand spray-painting his squat. He\nfalls in love with rich American girl\nRachel, who just happens to be\nplaying Juliet at the local theatre.\nJealousy arrives in the form of\nvicious biker Stray Cat. There is\nfencing with pool cues to the sound\nof Prokofiev.\nDirector Mike Same's career\nnosedived in 1970 with the release\nof 'myra breckinridge', which was\nabout a transsexual film critic and\nstarred Raquel Welch. Eulogized by\nAndy Warhol and panned by film\ncritics, its fate was sealed. In the\npunk and the princess Same gets\naway with having his cake and\neating it. The film claims to be\nbased on Shakespeare, but in fact\nthis is no West Kensington Story,\nand the parallels with Romeo and\nJuliet drawn in Leonard Bernstein's musical don't stand up in this case.\nWho cares though, when the fly-on-the-wall, hand-held camera style\nmakes the street banter of David\nand his mates so vivid and fun. He\nlooks a bit lobo tomis ed in the love\nscenes but Rachel's lovely, and\nsome of it's very funny. He shows\nher his diary: \"I 'll never finish it\nthough,\" he confides. \"...I can't spell.\" Discuss, with reference to the\nBard and the National Curriculum.\nJunior is a film about how a scientist (Arnold Schwarzenegger)\nbecomes the first ever pregnant\nman after he decides to act as\nguinea pig for his wonder\npregnancy drug, Expectane. The\nfilm also stars Danny DeVito as a gynaecologist and Emma Thompson\nas a researcher who has succeeded\nin freezing human eggs.\nLike Twins, which also stars\nSchwarzenegger and DeVito\ntogether, the idea behind the film is\ntoo silly for the audience to accept.\nSo it is only the charming\nperformances given by the three\nmain actors which makes Junior a delightful and enjoyable film to\nwatch. Sure, the idea of Arnie in\ndrag in the later scenes probably\nseems unoriginal after Robin\nWilliams' recent performance in\nMrs. Doubtfire but still, it is very\nfunny and shows how successfully\nSchwarzenegger can switch\nbetween action films like 'true lies'\nand comedy.\nWatch in amazement as Arnie's stomach enlarges as the months go\nby and laugh at his bewilderment\nas he experiences and learns more\nabout what it is like to be a woman.\nWhy do I always get saddled\nwith these highbrow art-house\nmovies? My preferred form of\nentertainment may be an evening\nof Wagner, but when it comes to\nthe cinema I want car-chases,\nshoot-outs and lashing s of\ngratuitous kinky sex. (Well OK then,\nlet's not be greedy; if there was\nenough gratuitous kinky sex I could\nprobably do without the car-chases.)\nActually I ended up with vanya\non 42nd street by default. In the\ncinema editor's word association\ntest I was the only one who didn't respond to Chekhov with \"phase rs locked on, Captain\". For this is\nAnton Chekhov's Uncle Vanya,\nadapted by David Mamet for\ntheatre director Andre Gregory.\nLouis Malle has filmed a run-through of Gregory's production in\nNew York's disused New\nAmsterdam Theatre. The action is\nmostly in close-up, which is\ndisconcerting when Yelena (Julianne\nMoore) bares her fearsome canines\nat the camera. While the\nprotagonists are all obviously very\ncommitted and the acting first-rate,\none is left with the thought that\nChekhov didn't intend his\ncharacters to be observed from a distance of never more than six\nfeet. And what is potentially a fascinating venue, the dilapidated\ntheatre, isn't sufficiently exploited. It\nwould certainly be a great place for\na shoot-out. 0\nl \u00ab 9 4 FELIX MM\n\n"

He\nbelieves that AIDS is caused by an enormous\nlevel of exposure to viruses and bacteria.\nEvery day we come into contact with millions\nof viruses and bacteria. They enter and live\ninside our bodies for varying lengths of time.\nSome make us ill; most we know nothing\nabout. The level of these foreign organisms\nmay accumulate over time, so that after, say,\n10 years, we have a tidy collection of tens of\nthousands of viruses. There may be a threshold level at which there are too many\naround for our bodies to cope with.\nViruses other than HIV may start to\nattack the immune system. Maybe HIV's presence is coincidental, and it happens to be\nthe only virus we are testing for. The real\nculprit goes undetected and HIV becomes the\nscapegoat. It's possible, and as a theory it\ndefinitely holds water.\nA different theory, put forward by\nHarvey Bialy, another journal editor, insists\nthat AIDS in Africa can be attributed to\ndecline in health care, poor sanitation,\neconomic decline and the development of\ndrug-resistant infections. HIV may just be an\n'entity of convenience', which meets the\nneeds of researchers. Its effects are easier to\ninvestigate than those of political, economic\nand social problems. Many\nscientists involved in the\ndebate are concerned that\nwhile it is becoming\nincreasingly clear that\nfactors other than HIV\nmust be involved in AIDS,\nfunded research\nconcentrates purely on\nHIV.\nDr Alfred Hassig, director of a Swiss\nblood transfusion lab, thinks that multiple\nstresses on the immune system provoke an\nacute reaction. This allows latent microbes,\nincluding HIV, to start attacking. He believes\ndietary measures can reverse the process.\nSo what's the message we give to the\nworld? That HIV does not cause AIDS? Then\nwhat? Shares in Durex will plummet. We\nmight revert from safer sex to safe sex. Even\nback to good ole plain sex.\nYou've spent the evening with Mr X at\na party. He's gorgeous,\nwith a top personality\nand a sharp wit. He\ntells you he's HIVpositive. Do you sleep\nwith him? Even using\na condom? It's all very\nwell for the sc ep tics to\nsay that HIV is not\ninvolved but there's still a nagging thought\nin the back of your\nmind as you peel off\neach other's underwear.\nIt taps on your shoulder blade and whispers\nthrough your earwax that there must be a good reason why all those scientists were\nconvinced for over a decade that HIV was the\nculprit. $3 billion of research, $3 billion of\nresearch.\nIf they're not sure about the link\n\"Your dilemma is sex\nwith an HIV-positive\nman. The rest ofthe\nevening may end shortly\nwith cold shoulders and\ncold showers...\"\nbetween HIV and AIDS, what about the link\nbetween HIV and sex? Is it definitely\nsexually transmitted? Infection with HIV\ndoes appear to happen when a person has\nunprotected sex. However, scientists have\nbeen unable to find any live HIV in semen.\nSurely if HIV were transmitted in this way,\nmasses of it would be around. A substantial\namount of HIV would be needed to have any\neffect on the recipient of the sperm.\nIt must be very frustrating to know that\nfor HIV to be sexually transmitted it must be\nin semen. And yet it can't be found. Maybe\nwe are looking for the wrong thing. So what\ndid we decide about the sex? Give it a miss or\ncarry on regardless? The frustration of the\nscientists will pale in comparison to your own\nif you don't decide soon.\nI'm assuming here that you'll be\nattracted to Mr X in the first place. This\nmakes you either a heterosexual woman or a homosexual man. Your dilemma is sex with\nan HIV-positive man. What about the other\nway round: an HIV-positive woman? Your\nrisk assessment this time is slightly different.\nFemale to male transmission of HIV occurs at\nan extremely low rate. The risk is much\nsmaller. Woman to woman transfer occurs at\nan even lower rate.\nWhat's the decision? In most cases the\nvery stigma and\nassociations of HIV are\ngoing to put you off\nbefore you go anywhere\nnear the underside of\nhis/her duvet. The rest\nof the evening may end\nshortly with cold\nshoulders and cold\nshowers. You're as\npolitically correct as the\nnext person, but\nputting your life on the\nline is just not sensible.\nThe rebel scientists could be right, but\nthey could equally well be wrong. How would\nyou feel if you ignored all the safer sex advice\nand someone proved that HIV was the cause?\nFor the time being, the blanket advice of\ndon't do anything with anyone is definitely\nthe safest.

The same arrangement has applied to the constituent college unions.\nThere has been no subscription fee charged to the students or their students\nto secure membership.The college has funded ICU and the CCUs to enable the\nprovision of a range of services and facilities for students - sorting, cultural,\nrecreational etc - and students have been free to use or not use these services as\nthey individually decided.\nHowever, under the provisions of the Education Act 1 994 the college is\nspecifically obliged to make provision for students to opt out of membership of\nStudent Unions.\nMoreover the college is charged with ensuring that any student who\nexercises the right to opt out should not be \"unfairly disadvantaged\" with regard\nto accessing services and facilities available to the rest of the student body.\nIn order to comply with this requirement, the college has agreed with ICU\nthat ICU will act as the college \"agent\" in the provision of facilities and services\nfor all our registered students. The college will continue to fund ICU and the\nCCUs on the traditional basis so that the normal provision of services and\nfacilities is available to all registered students irrespective of whether they have\nformally opted out of union membership or not.\nThe only practical effect therefore of opting out will be that such students\ncannot stand for elected office or take part in Union elections.\nFor this purpose the college needs to know and to keep a record of students\nwho have opted out.\nThus all registered students who wish to exercise their rights under the\nEducation Act 1 994 of formally opting out of ICU and C CU membership for the\nsession 1 994-5 are required to come to the registry (Room 343 on level 3 of the\nSherfield Building) by monday 9 January 1 995 (the beginning of the spring\nterm) to record their decision.\nP.E.

    "content": "News and Editorial\nUs in the NUS?\nBY RACHEL WALTERS\nImperial students will not re-affiliate with the National Union\nof Students (NUS) according to a chemistry department survey\ncarried out last week.\nMiles Ambler, Departmental\nRepresentative for chemistry, has\norganised a preliminary survey\nof l st and 2nd year chemists to\nestablish the level of support for\na referendum on the issue. When\nasked whether Imperial should\njoin the NUS, only 27%\nresponded positively.\nIn a survey which also tried\nto gauge the levels of\ninvolvement and interest that\nstudents show for Union issues\nin general, it was notable that\nover a third of students could not\nname their Union President.\nInterestingly, those who felt\nmost strongly that ICU should\nretain its independence seemed\nto be the best informed, and were\nthe most likely to attend Union\nGeneral Meetings.\nExplaining his motives for\norganising the survey, Mr Ambler said, \"I didn't want\npeople to have to vote in a referendum when they were\nunaware of the advantages and\ndisadvantages involved.\" He says\nhe wanted to heighten awareness\nof the issue and find out how\nmuch students knew of the\nimplications of joining the NUS.\nDescribing the NUS as\n'discredited', he said that it was\ngenerally accepted as being\nsocialist, and, \"doesn't accurately\nreflect the middle-class\nLiberal/Tory attitude of the\naverage Imperial student\".\nLucy Chothia, ICU President, said that she was glad\nto get feedback on the issue. She\nemphasised that she didn't want\nto press u rise students into\nrejoining the NUS, but felt that\nstudents had the right to be\ninformed. Ms Chothia has said\nthat she will research the final\ncosts and present the arguments\nfor and against affiliation to\nstudents if there is sufficient\ndemand.\nThe survey comes in the\nsame week that the Union\nGeneral Meeting voted to enter\ninto dialogue with the NUS in\norder to, \"discuss the possibilities of membership of ICU\nor its Constituent College\nUnions\". The proposer, John\nSinner, believes that present\nmembers should have the right\nto decide whether Imperial\nCollege Union returns to the\nNUS or not. He added that\npresent students have not\ndebated the issue and should be\ngiven the chance to do so.\nNews Review\nDecember\nThe month of festivities saw nasty assaults, nea\npoverty for students and so far not much else!\nInterest increased in mascot ry with raids on bot\nQueen Mary and Westfield and King's Colleges\nby the Royal College of Science Union Mascotry\nteam. Worryingly, fears that a university\neducation may become only a pursuit of the we\nheeled begin to arise.\nFELIX1 Q14 Students fearing increasing hardship were told that the level of tuition\nfees would be frozen this year. But a reduction in the number of people\ngoing to university was planned and the grants were cut by a further\n8%. Four Union Stewards required hospital treatment following a brawl in Beit Quad. Controversy arose over Imperial College Security's role in the incident. A further fracas occurred in the Mathematics\nLibrary when a fight broke out between a current and an ex-student.\nIn a more docile battle, following continued complaints from residents\nof 169 Queens Gate, it was suggested that the pedestrian gates on\nImperial College Road may close at night. The residents had\ncomplained of damage to cars and 'general horsing around.'\ne^ i/s riaL An Escalation of Arms?\nWalking out of the quad last\nFriday night, I noticed the new\nShowsec security guys on the\ngate. They are huge and no doubt\nquite a deterrent to those thinking of spoiling another's evening\nout. But are they necessary?\nWith the events of the disturbance on the 2nd December\nstill very fresh in many peoples'\nminds, the obvious answer is 'yes'.\nAfter all, the stewards lacked the\nfirepower to subdue or restrain\nthe assailants, right? That may be\ntrue, but it is worth considering\nwhat their role is (or should be).\nI was talking to an old time\nmember of ICU who was saying\nthat four years ago there was only\none 'duty officer' in charge on\nWednesday and Friday nights.\nS/ he was given responsibility by\nthe appropriate Sabbatical to\nensure the Bars closed, that\neveryone left the building, and\nwhile keeping a low profile, to\nsort out any problems that may\nhave arisen. Any serious problem\nmeant calling security or the\npolice. Cards were not checked on\nentrance to the Union, so any\nnumber of students (or anyone\nelse) could enter un accounted. The situation was reviewed\nafter a serious incident involving\na duty officer. Card checking was\nbrought in and in the years that\nfollowed the number of student\nstaff (now known as stewards) on\nduty increased to current levels.\nThe old black jumper of the duty\nofficer was replaced with the\nbright yellow uniforms currently\nused. And now people appear to\nbe being 'escorted' from the quad\nwith greater frequency. The role\nhas become a high profile one.\nI have no doubt that those\npeople removed were being\nobnoxious or worse. But the idea\nthat students can act in such a 'policing' manner seems\ndangerous. The same students\nwho are meeting in lectures and\ncompeting in football matches are\nforced into a relationship of\nAuthority vs Miscreant. And with\ntwo or three stewards supporting\nthe one who 'confronts' an\nundesirable, (who probably saw\npeople being removed the week\nbefore) can the situation be\nanything but charged?\nIt is a difficult situation,\nthat's certain. But in the long run,\nmaybe increasing the muscle on\nhand only puts more burden on\nthose at the front, those most\nvulnerable, the stewards.\nThank You...\nTo everyone who was involved in\nproducing and printing this issue\nover-bitten issue.

According to the\nteachings of the prophet Zartosht,\nZarathustrian being the dominant religion in\nIran before the arrival of Islam, we are all\naffected by the constant struggle between\ngood (light) and evil (darkness). Hence the\nimportance of the Sun, light and fire in many\nIranian ceremonies.\nThe night of the solstice is the longest\nnight of the year and the time when the devil,\nAhriman, is at its most powerful. To protect\nagainst and thwart evil, we celebrate the\narrival of longer days as a sign of the ever\ngrowing power of the Zarathustrian God,\nAhuramazda. As a way of thanking God for\nwhat they had been given, and to pray for a plentiful season ahead, dried fruits and nuts,\nthat were kept over from the summer, were\nserved.\nSuch elaborate celebrations of the solstice were not restricted to the Iranian\nEmpire, but were also passed on to the\nRomans; Natalis (literally 'birth') became one\nof the most important events of the Roman\ncalendar, large celebrations being held well\ninto the fourth century AD. Up until then the\nbirth of Christ was celebrated on the fifth of\nJanuary; but the church decided to combine\nthe event with Natalis, which by now was\nbeing mistakenly held on the twenty fifth day\nof December. Christmas came to be celebrated on this date with ceremonies very similar\nto the Iranian celebration of Yalda.\nIranian culture is extremely rich and we\nall do our best to continue and promote our\nnational identity and the traditions of our\nancestors.\nYalda celebrations will be held by the\nIranian Society of Imperial College in the\nJCR on Saturday 17 December. There will be\nlive music and traditional fruits and nuts will\nbe served.\nThe factual information for this piece was\nobtained from the book \"Ancient Ceremonies of\nIran\" by H Zahedi.\nwho IC Snooker\nWhat: Southern Comfort\nKeys: Ceiling, Spirit, Legion\nSunday 20 November saw a new chapter in\nthe IC Snooker Club. Southampton hosted a friendly match against our brave boys who\nhad to play against a string of unfavourable\nodds... train delays, closed station, no taxis,\nlow ceilings, large legion of home supporters\nand empty stomachs.\nThe format of the friendly was that every\nteam player in the IC Team A plays a single\nframe with the opposing team and similarly\nfor Team B. Therefore, a best of 25 frames\ndecides the winner.\nTeam A showed grit, determination and\nbrilliance as the ploughed through\nSouthampton to win convincingly. Notably\nJon won all of his games. Team B, though\ndisplaying similar fighting spirit, was less\nsuccessful. Team spirit was the order of the\nday as they fought ceaselessly, always supporting each other. As the day progressed\nframe after frame proved a painful battle, the\nteam finally succumbed and failed to achieve\nthe number of frames required to win.\nThis is not the only friendly match the\nsnooker club have planned. There will be\nothers and on 3-5 March there is the Annual\nInter-University Snooker Championships in\nCardiff. If you are interested in any of these\nevents or just want to play the game, come up\nto the Snooker rooms (3rd floor union) any\nlunch time. Membership is \u00a38 for unlimited\nuse of the tables with no other charges\nthroughout the year.\nTeam A were P Kellet, V Ly, J Fulcher,\nS Baugh and A Robinson. Team B were B Drinkwater, P Chew, N Samsathi, A Hassan\nand R Godbole.\nwho Euro Youth\nWhat: BEST Summer Course\nKeys: Distributed, Excellence\nFor those of you that haven't yet realised the\nBoard of European Students of Technology is\nrepresented by the Society for European\nYouth at Imperial College. We are the local\nBEST group for the London area, and for the\nfirst time this year we decided to undertake\nthe organisation of a major BEST project; a summer course of 2 weeks co-organised with\nthe university of Newcastle, oriented towards\nDistributed Computing, a field of excellence\nat IC. A special subcommittee has been created to monitor the progress of the project and\nto deal with all aspects of organisation. The\nprogramme of the course will encompass all\naspects of Distributed Computing and the\ntimetabled lectures will be given by high-pro-file expert lecturers; we are ambitious enough\nto be thinking of inviting lecturers from\nother European countries and the U.S.. In\nany case the course will be international in\nthe sense that it will be part of the BEST\nsummer programme for 1995 and will thus be\nattend able by BEST members of other local\ngroups around Europe.

    "content": "News\nNews Review\nFELIX1 O11 There was uproar over the vetting of overseas students by the Foreign\nOffice. Students from India, Pakistan, Israel, Libya, Iran, Iraq, Syria,\nEgypt, Cuba and North Korea will soon be vetted before they can\naccept posts in Britain. The move results after concern over the\npossible proliferation of militarily dangerous technologies. Students\nbegan to worry following an announcement in a national newspaper of\nthe governments plans to privat is e the Student Loans Company. Lucy\nChothia, President of Imperial College Union, condemned the move as\n\"completely appalling\". At St Mary's, students were apprehensive\nwhen informed of their position in the move to the proposed new\nBiomedical Science building. It was also announced that HEFCE\nwould not fund the entire cost of the new building, with the shortfall\nof \u00a311 million to be found by the college.\nFELIX lOI2 The release of this year's Rag Mag caused a mixed reception. Imperial\nCollege Union made no moves to ban it despite its offensive nature.\nThe cover of the magazine showed a picture of the Moor's murderers\ncollecting money for the National Society for the Protection of Cruelty\nto Children with the slogan 'Doing it for the kids'. The literature also\nfeatured pictures of pierced male genitals. Elsewhere, the plans for the\nBiomedical Sciences building caused yet more headaches when it was\ndiscovered that the Chemistry department faced the loss of two lecture\ntheatres if it went ahead. Alone amongst such college momentum, a student lobbied his department for 24 hour access to computing\nfacilities. He was soon joined by 100 petitioners.\nFELIX1013 Students from St Mary's Hospital Medical School swamped the Union\nGeneral Meeting. Over 450 people packed into the Union Ents lounge,\nthe largest attendance in many years. The Mary's students were\nattempting to retain their financial independence until they moved to\nthe South Kensington site. And this wasn't the only mark Mary's students left on Imperial it was discovered. Students sprayed 'Mary's Forever' in white paint on the roof of the walkway. Also at the UGM, a student suffered head injuries in a freak accident. Sam Scotcher, VicePresident of Royal College of Science Union, was hit on the head by a falling tripod. The tripod was dropped by a member of the STOIC\nteam who were trying to film the meeting. Miss Scotcher was taken to\nSt Mary's Hospital but informed that the injuries were not serious.\nHopes of free Friday nights at the Union were dashed at the UGM.\nThe motion calling for the entrance charge to be scrapped was thrown\nout. Also the University of London Union banned the sale of Imperial\nCollege Rag Mag on their premises and over 30 IC students appeared\non BBC's Children in Need. All members of Imperial College Dance\nClub, they presented a cheque of money raised during a sponsored\n24hour dance.\nThe News Editor would like to especially thank the following people...\nMerry Christmas and have a Happy New Year.\nRachel Walters, Lynn Bravey, Dave Cohen, Declan Curry, Ian Davey,\nAndrew Dorman-Smith, Mike Ingram, Peter Lantgan, Andrew Long, Michael\nLudlam, Joe McFadden, Rebecca Mileham, Andy Sinharay, John Sinner.\nNuclear Jones\nBY ANDY SINHARAY\nDr Gareth Jones, college tutor\nand senior lecturer, has received\nthe Nuclear Electric Prize 1994\nfor Education in Physics.\nThe prize has been awarded\nin recognition of the work done\nby Dr Jones in establishing the\nPhysics Department's Year in\nEurope course. It is part of the\nannual partnership awards which\nare sponsored by industry and\nidentify innovation and\ndevelopment in Higher\nEducation across various\nacademic fields.\nThe Physics'Department's year in Europe course, one of the\nfirst to be set up at Imperial\nCollege, evolved from a scheme\nstarted by Dr Jones in the late\n1980s. Speaking to FELIX, Gareth Jones said, \"It was started\nby contacts I had with colleagues,\nand it grew into an arrangement\nfor summer research projects.\"\nDr Jones was director of\nundergraduate studies at the\ntime. He added that it was\nintended to allow undergraduates\nthe chance to experience research\nas postgraduates were able to.\nA scheme was subsequently\nset up, allowing undergraduate\nstudents to travel to other\nEuropean universities during the\nsummer. The first group went\nacross in 1987, and the\ndepartment now has established\nlinks with about ten universities,\nincluding Hamburg in Germany,\nPadua in Italy and Grenoble in\nFrance. The programme was\nlater extended to the whole year.\nIt is now part of the department's year in Europe scheme, which\nallows students the chance to\nspend their third year at a host\nuniversity abroad.\nThe last few years have seen\naround 20 students going abroad\nannually, with seventy students\ncompleting research projects\noverseas during the last seven\nyears. Many students have since\nsaid that the European element\nof their course has proved useful\nin obtaining employment or PhD\nplaces. \"I have been very\nimpressed by the work the\nstudents have accomplished, and\nthe beneficial effect the scheme\nhas had on their professional\ndevelopment,\" said Dr Jones.\nThe Final UGM\nBY MICHAEL LUD LAM The very last Union General\nMeeting (UGM) was held last\nFriday. Under the new Imperial\nCollege Union constitution\nwhich is set to be introduced at\nthe beginning of the next term,\nthe UGM will be replaced by a Council Meeting of\nRepresentatives.\nDespite the imminent\ndemise of the UGM the interest\nin Union affairs remained\nconfined to a tiny minority of\nstudents. Less than 70 people\nturned up to discuss the motions\nand elect next year's committee\nmembers. It had been hoped by\nsome that there would be a revival in interest in UGM's following the huge numbers who\npacked out the Ents Lounge at\nlast month's meeting.\nIn a motion proposed by\nJohn Durrell, the UGM decided\nthat Lucy Chothia, Imperial\nCollege Union (ICU) President,\nshould try to gain a place on the\ncollege committee called the\nManagement Planning Group.\nAt present this is the only\ncommittee in college not to have\nsome form of student\nrepresentation.\nThe committee discusses the\nmajor moves and changes in\nCollege and recently discussed\nthe move of ICU to the Sherfield\nbuilding. It was argued by Mr\nDurrell that if a student\nrepresentative had been present\nat the time of these discussions\nthem, \"it wouldn't have taken us\nso much by surprise.\"\n1 1 FELIX I4DEC91\n\n"

The phone call\nprocedures made to the police are\nbeing scrutinised following\nevidence that the police were not\nmade known of the urgency of\nthe situation.\nFollowing the fray in Beit\nQuad, college security insist that\ntwo calls were made requesting\nassistance, at 2.26am and 2.55am. Whilst Scotland Yard's Press\nBureau have admitted that the\nfirst call was received, they\ndispute the statement of the\nsecurity guard placing the call\nwho has said that violent action\ntaking place was reported. The\npolice have the call recorded as\nonly reporting a theft, which had\nalready been reported by the\nvictim and hence they had not\nresponded immediately to the\ncall.\nMr Keith Reynolds, Head of\nSecurity of Imperial College, has\nagreed that in communication\nbetween college security and\npolice that there may have been a 'bit of confusion' on 'both sides\nof the fence'. While defending the\nactions of security he admitted\nthat 'this one may have got away\nfrom us a bit', but insisted that he\nwould try his best to make sure\nthat 'nothing like this ever\nSTOP!\nHave you\npicked up your\nsupplement?\n(FELIX 1015-X) happens again.'\nSince the event was last\nreported, ( FELIX1014), explanations have become available\nas to why college security did not\nattempt to restrain the alleged\nassailants of the Union Stewards.\nOne of the officers present at the\ntime has explained that as\nsecurity were under the\nimpression that one of the\nassailants was a civil engineering\nstudent, he could easily be\npursued through college\nprocedures. In addition, since the\nsituation was so tense that any\nintervention by security could\nhave led to further fighting, it\nwas decided not to pursue the\nattackers at the time.\nWith departmental and\ncollege photographs as yet not\nleading to any successful\nidentification s by those Union\nStewards involved in the\nincident, the offenders remain at\nlarge. While confirming that\nUnion records of people signed in\nthat night were not any help,\nsome leaving only first names\nand others being completely\nindecipherable, Terry Briley,\nDeputy head of security, has said\nthat it 'would of course help if\naccurate records were kept'.\nCollege security have once again\nappealed for anyone with any\nknowledge as to the identity of\nthe perpetrators of the assault to\ncome forward in total\nconfidentiality.\nLucy Chothia, Imperial College Union President, was hospitalised las\nwhen her jaw locked as she yawned, writes Rachel Walters. Lucy s pe days in Charing Cross hospital so that she could shut her mouth a gai said that she was 'just walking to the bus stop with an old school friend she yawned so widely that her jaw clicked out of place leaving her m stuck open. Explaining the incident, the ICU President admitted that s a weak jaw, and that in fact, she had the problem as a15 year old.

    "content": "POLITICAL SCIENCE\nCluedUp\nThe government's science policy\nhas, like many others, been kicked\naround between the idealistic libertarian and pragmatic interventionist camps. The recent budget and\nedicts issued from HMT and DoE\nover this year have highlighted this\nfootball game.\nOn the one side there's the\ndefinite - and sensible - push for\nUniversities to stand up on their\nown two feet. Yet short term\nactions confuse this aim. For\nexample, Universities are not\nallowed to charge the government\nthe full cost of tuition fees. For\nexample, recent budget proposals\ndisallow flexibility in VAT payments\nover the long term, a system used\nby Universities to free up cash flow\nin capital expenditure projects. For\nexample, the DoE has started to\nhand out \u00a3500 to first year engineering students, thus artificially\ninflating the demand for these\ndegrees. For example, the govern-ment's stated policy is to fund\nresearch which \"creates wealth\",\nthus contradicting the assumption\none would have that the market\nwould be able to deal with wealth\ncreating research and that the government should maybe concentrate\non funding basic research. The list\nof examples go on.\nBut despite the unsure signals\ncoming from the policy makers, the\nyear as a whole has had several\ngood points for science, and for IC\nin particular. IC's bid to form a BMS seems vigorous and exciting.\nAnd the formation of the Russell\nGroup can only be good news for\nIC and its members.\nOn the wider front, the\nHuman Fertilisation and\nEmbryology Authority's( HFEA)\nreport on Ovarian Tissue in\nresearch is an example of how to\ntackle complex scientific issues.\nAnd to tackle them in a way that\nthe public understands and appreciates. The HFEA's approach is a constructive alternative to the\nsound bites that scientists and policy makers are training themselves\nto perform.\nFinally, and on a \"lighter\"\nnote, if you might be wondering\nwhere all this science is leading us,\nthen John McCarthy - one of the\nfathers of Al - is giving a lecture on\nLemmings (yes, the computer\ngame!) as a new laboratory animal\nfor Al.

He rounds off the\nyear with this unusual offering...\nNEW WORLD ORDER\nThe end of the twentieth century is\nwitnessing a widening gap\nbetween the rich and the poor\nnations. Developed nations are\nzooming down the Information\nHighway, whilst the underdeveloped are busy fighting wars, disease and poverty - quite a world of\ncontrasts.\n\"The Third\nWorld does not\nneed pity...\" Every time wars break out, or\nfamines decimate Africa or any\nother Third World nation, disturbing television pictures are beamed\naround the globe urging ordinary\ncitizens to act. Aid agencies set up\nhot-lines for donations, pop stars\nhold concerts and the Pope prays\nfor the afflicted. This is a cycle that\nhas repeated itself many a time:\nEthiopia, Somalia and Rwanda, to\nname just a few.\nApart from emergency aid,\ndeveloping countries are constantly\nreceiving aid from richer nations\nand organisations such as the\nWorld Bank and the IMF. Since the\n1 970s, poor nations have been\nreceiving loans and grants amounting\nto trillions of dollars. Primarily this\nmoney is intended for development\nand growth, but has this growth\nmaterialise d? Definitely not. The\nThird World countries have developed a 'dependency culture'; they\nhave become addicted to aid.\nThe IMF's common prescriptions for ailing economies is now\nworking. Reducing government\nemployees, d evaluating currencies\nand cutting imports, only bring\nabout unemployment, civil strife\nand the creation of trade barriers.\nWhat developing and underdeveloped countries need is investment\nand genuine guidance. Developed\nnations should lift trade barriers\nimposed on agricultural and raw\nmaterials produced in poorer co un tries. This may sound easier said\nthat done, but it seems quite illogical and unfair that prices for commodities produced in the developing countries should be determined\nin spot markets in London or New\nYork. Essentially, the buyer determines the price, a dream for all\nconsumers!\nRich, arms producing countries\nmust stop arming these poor\nnations. Military expenditure in\nsome African countries is as high\nas 40% of their national budgets.\nBillions of dollars are poured into\nhuge military arsenals whilst their\ntowns and cities lack basic facilities.\nThird World countries do not need\narmies - the world's two strongest\neconomies, Germany and Japan\nhave shown just that. The Third\nWorld does not need aid and pity,\nwhat they need is free trade, arms\nembargoes and freedom that can\nbe achieved by the West stopping\nthe propping of despotic tyrants\nand dictators.\n\"What developing countries\nneed is genuine\nguidance...\"\nThese problems seem far\naway but they are closer to home\nthan may appear, because the\nwidening gap between First and\nThird Worlds puts migratory pressures on Europe that can shake the\npeace, harmony and prosperity\nthat one seems to take for granted.\nAITA\n;Always wit ka keen cy t'j oc\nworld politics, j A it a brings a little\nof t ke big bad wo rid to ow f lecture theatres every fort nig kt. \"Here aqa in ke dives into fk e foray of international diplomacy...\n3 ko pet kat your Prater' st kree wise men ka ve provided at least\na little mind fodder for t ke end of\nt ke year, j Look fo^wa^A to more\ntko ug kt bites in t ke returning\nyear.\n^/ours, as ever, T~ra terT~ iam.\nFELIX MM\n\n"

Well whatever it is, it's not the acting. Dramsoc's hamlet\nboasts an impressive cast who, if a little stiff at the beginning, certainly\nliven up throughout the play. Apart\nfrom a couple of dubious choices,\nthe cast are well selected and most\nimportantly, believable.\nAlthough on the whole the\nparts were played in a plausible\nmanner, there are some which\nstand out among the rest. Mathew\nWilliams delivers an excellent\nportrayal of the confused and\nunstable Hamlet, who, for the\nmajority of the time, appears to be\non the verge of a nervous\nbreakdown. Gulenn Tambe gives a smouldering performance as the\nsometimes rather weakly portrayed\nGertrude and Katherine Fishwick is\nextremely competent in her role as\nthe tragic, not to mention dip py, Ophelia. Joe McFadden (Laertes)\nand Ed Mulligan (Polonius) are also\ngood.\nThe direction appears to run\nsmoothly, although I'm not\nconvinced that the 'microphone\nghost' works. The costumes are\ncolourful and although I did doubt\nthe wisdom of director Iqbal Khan,\nwhen he dressed Hamlet in black\nmodern costume, I have to admit\nthat it works - although I think\nthat's as much to do with the\nhenna as anything else.\nRosencrantz and guildenstern are dead (or R&G as it is\naffectionately known by its\nproduction team) is a brilliant\nattempt by Tom Stoppard at\npresenting Shakespeare's Hamlet\nfrom the point of view of two minor\ncourtiers battling to find meaning in\ntheir existence. Jim Kingston\n{Rosencrantz... umm m, or was he\nGuildenstern?) and Rys Jaszek (the\nother one!), accompanied by an\nassortment of uncanny characters,\npresent a rumbling tumbling\ndelivery of witty word plays. Jim\nseems well at home with his\ncharacter and the two manage to\nproduce some smart dialogue.\nOccasionally the pace was let down\nby stumbling support, but hard\nheaded ness( literally!) and\ndetermination prevailed and the\nshow went on. All said and done\nthe first night's performance that I saw was a valiant try at a very\ndifficult play. To the unsuspecting\nviewers who may have found this\nplay somewhat bizarre, if not totally\nincomprehensible,'! say: see\nHamlet and the penny will drop, my\nbet is, heads up! \u00a9\nf FELIX I4DCC91\n\n"

Will pearl jam's third\nalbum, vita h gy, be a return to\nthe ethereal strains of 'ten'?\nNo, it will be their punk rock\nalbum. No, Eddie Vedder has\ngone mad and this will be their\nfinale, etc etc. Yet, as usual all\nthe rumours are wrong...\nWell, sort of anyway. There\nare many moments, particularly\nin the latter half of the album,\nthat do hark back to the gentle,\ncaressing face of the\naforementioned classic debut.\n'Better man' and 'immortality'\nboth take harsh and agonising\nsubject matter and wrap them\nup in haunting soundscapes.\nThe latter sees Vedder wearing\nhis heart on his sleeve and\npoignantly captures his struggle\nto come to terms with Kurt\nCobain's search for true\nnirvana: \"scrawl dissolved, cigar\nbox on the floor / a truant finds\nhome / and a wish to hold on ...\ntruants move on / cannot stay\nlong ... some die just to live.\"\nHowever, there are also angry,\nbruising tirades in the likes of recent\nsingle 'spin the black circle', 'last\nexit' and 'whipping'. The former\ncomes as a bit of a shock. A paean\nto the declining use of vinyl (v if a logy was released on vinyl a week before\nit emerged on cd) and with a riff\nthat could have come from the sex\npistols at their most savage, this is\ngenuine 'punk rock'. And I don't mean 'punk' as a tag mistakenly\nattached to the likes of energetic\npop acts like green day. No, this is\nuncompromising, heartfelt and\nmore importantly superb - a fitting\nreturn to Vedder's roots in bands\nsuch as bad radio and the\nminutemen.\nAt the end of the day, it doesn't really matter what the rumours say.\nVitalogy is not perfect (tracks such\nas 'bugs' are too weird even for\nweirdness's sake) but it is\nchallenging, honest and an organic\nprogression. Not bad for a band\nwith a mad frontman who are about\nto split up. (8)\nDie toten hosen are\napparently Germany's biggest band\nand after hearing their new album,\nlove, peace and money, I know why.\nIt consists of their 13 favourite\nsongs translated into English \"to\ngive everyone outside Germany\nsome idea of what we're singing\nabout\" and a Johnny Thunders\ncover. This latter track hints at their\nand roll\nmusical heritage - punk y sleazy\nsleaze of new york dolls crossed\nwith the riffs of the wild hearts. After\nlistening to this once I found myself\nsinging along clearly a sign of how\ncatchy the songs are.\nTheir name means 'the dead\ntrousers' and sadly it appears their\ntrousers have died if the cover's anything to go by. But ignore the\ncover, the music's brilliant! I can't find words to describe how\nwonderful they are. Shame they\ndon't look good too! (9)\nCan you really blame Joni\nMitchell for having only one idea\nfor her new album turbulent indigo?\nI mean, people do it all the time\nand seem to get away with it.\nUnfortunately, Joni doesn't quite\nseem to have master that knack yet.\nEach of the songs begins with a gently strumming guitar (except\n'nothing to blame' which has a piano bit first, then a gently\nstrumming guitar). Each song starts\nquietly, has a quiet middle and, well\n- I 'll leave you to guess what the\nendings are like. The whole album\nhas a very sedate, laid-back feel\nwhich would have been fine, if only\nthe songs themselves were\nident if i ably different. I forced\nmyself to listen to the whole album\nin the hope that maybe, just maybe,\nthere was something in it that would\nmake me interested. In the end, I was left feeling quite, quite bored. (4)\nRock has its fair share of loudmouthed frontmen and Kory Clarke,\nlead singer of American art\nme taller s warrior soul, is up\nthere with the best of them.\nTheir latest album, 'space age\nplayboys', takes a less overtly\npolitical stance than their four\nprevious concoctions and this\nhas subsequently led to more\nrelaxed live performances. Not\nthat they are any less intense\nor heavy than before. If\nanything, choosing to perform\nthe whole of the new opus in\nits punk-fuelled, galloping\nstate gave the Brixton Academy\ncrowd more of a pummelling\nthan they were probably\nexpecting. No, it's just that the\nband's ease and sense of\nenjoyment was patently\nobvious for all to see. The\nwonders that removing the\nshackles of a major label\nrecord deal can do...\nHeadliners the almighty\nhave also been doing a touch\nof record company swapping\nof late, resulting in their\nangriest, heaviest and best\nalbum to date, 'crank'. They\ntoo chose to spew out the\nwhole of their new creation, a move which might have\nbackfired if they hadn't slipped in a few old classics such as the\nan the mic 'wild and wonderful'. \u00a9\nS highways revisited\nI'm not saying there's nothing else about Imperial, or London, but the\nnumber 10 bus route is the main feature of college I 'll be nostalgic\nabout. I used to live in Hammersmith, at one end of the route, and\nnow I'm in Tufnell Park, at the other end. I particularly liked the way\nsome 10s used to terminate on Prince Consort Road, just outside my\ndepartment. These little luxuries are important to a girl. Admittedly, I didn't catch the 10 all the time when we were in Hammersmith,\nmainly because there were a lot more 9s and we caught taxis when\nwe were late (taxis into college - the dedication).\nNow, I'd have to beat the larks to get the 10 all along the back\nroads behind King's Cross, Oxford Street, Hyde Park Corner,\nKnightsbridge and to the Royal Albert Hall in time for morning\nlectures. No, I just dream home on the 10, out of peak hours of\ncourse. My favourite bit's Kings Cross, which has the wildest scenery -desolate canals and railway tracks - and the maddest passengers, if\nyou were the pompous one explaining bits of Tristram Shandy, could\nyou just go through that again? The scruffy grandeur of the three-storey Camden Road houses comes just before the tat and takeaways\nof Brecknock Road, and my stop. Oh I love this area, especially by bus.\nAnd the 10's nearly always empty by this time, and the conductor\nchats.\nOnce I got on a stationary 10, and the driver told me about how\nhe'd almost become a hearse-driver, except the money wasn't good.\nThe 10 was parked outside the Royal Albert Hall waiting for a rogue\nnumber 10 driver, Stokesy (Stokesy?), who goes too fast and leaves a backlog of passengers for the next 10, so that they could follow him\nfor a change. This isn't the sort of thing that happens on the 74, for\nexample, a route I loathe. I 'll be nostalgic for the hours on the number\n10 - fanta s ising, dozing, scorning Oxford Street, reaching home\nterritory in the dark - for years. 0\nf FELIX "

After\ncloser inspection by a museum\nexpert, it was realised that it was\nin danger of exploding. The\nemergency services were called\nand by 7.00pm around ten police\nvehicles had cordoned the area\noff. Four fire crews, including\ndangerous substances officers,\nwere at the scene within\nminutes.\nAssistant Divisional Officer\nPaul Turner, in charge of the\noperation, arrived in the Fire\nBrigade 'Incident Control\nVehicle'. \"At first we were there\npurely as a precautionary\nmeasure\", he said. \"Fire Brigade\nand Police explosives officers\nentered the building wearing\nblast-proof clothing and\nbreathing apparatus, to assess the\ndanger. They found a bucket\nsized spherical container full of a powdered substance that was\nabove a safe temperature.\"\nHe was unable to disclose\nthe name of the chemical\ninvolved. However, a reliable\nsource has indicated that it was a substance called sodium azide. A 'Hazards in the Chemistry\nLaboratory' manual states that it\n'decomposes somewhat explosively if heated above its\nmelting point'. If water is added\nwhen it is above a certain\ntemperature, it will also explode.\nIt is highly toxic, poisonous if\ntaken by mouth or breathed in,\nand causes blistering when in\ncontact with skin.\n\"It was decided that dilution\nin water was still possible\",\ncontinued A DO Turner.\nDangerous substances officers\nproceeded to decontaminate the\narea and by 8.30pm Exhibition\nRoad was reopened to traffic and\npedestrians.\nAt the scene, the museum\nCurator was unwilling to\ncomment on the incident and it\nwas the next day before a statement was issued. Rachael\nEdmonds, Press Officer for the\nmuseum, disclosed that the\nchemical had been on display in\nthe 'Glass Gallery'. \"There are a number of chemicals such as this\non display\", she said. \"They are\nexamined regularly, but on this\noccasion the substance had\nbegun to degrade. It was\ndisposed of safely. The\nemergency services were there\njust in case.\"\n(Millionaire Miner continues from page one)\nImperial were much harder than\nwhat I did for my MBa at LBS\".\nHe said that studying here gave\nhim his logical and quantitative\nability, with an analytical attitude\nto problem solving. He feels that\nlearning how to use computers\neffectively was particularly\nhelpful.\nInstead of using traditional\nmethods to predict stock market\ntrends, 'quant teams', such as the\none that Mr Alamouti heads, use\nderivatives. \"Using quantitative\ntechniques in marketing is very\nbig right now,\" he said.\nNormally, trading is based on\nanalysis of a company's past\nperformance, and on general\nmarket trends. From these charts,\ndealers work out what range of\nvalues shares will be most likely\nto have. Quanta techniques use\npartial differential equations to\ndetermine these ranges and seem\nto be considerably more\nsuccessful.\nWhen questioned about his\nhuge earnings, Mr Alamouti said:\n\"I really couldn't comment on\nthat.\" Using the combined\nmathematical skills of FELIX, it\nis estimated that we received\nabout \u00a3750 worth of his time.\ndisappear more rapidly as a spate of bizarre thefts swept Imperial\nCollege. Two visiting students were caught when they found\nthemselves locked inside the Department of Electrical and Electronic\nEngineering. Further thefts of the brass Imperial College Union\nplaque and FELIX Sign were blamed on Rag collectors. The 'Raggies'\nrepresented Universities all over the country and had come to London\nto participate in the Live Monopoly event.\nFELIX1 QQ9 Walk out! College caterers abandoned 150 diners attending the Royal\nSchool of Mines Union (RSMU) Freshers' Dinner. The catering staff\ncomplained about student drunkenness and vomiting. Vinod\nFernandez, RSMU President, declared that the dinner \"was far tamer\nthan in previous years\". Muslim extremists provoked uproar when\nthey distributed leaflets of an anti-homosexual and anti-Semitic nature\nin and around the University of London Union (ULU) premises.\nInterest came to a head in the 'university superleague'. Sir Ronald\nOxburgh, Rector of Imperial College, dismissed claims of a breakaway\nand suggested 'sensational journalism' had exaggerated the story.\nNovember\nThe news this month focussed on Islamic\nextreme is ts, idiotic Union General Meetings\n(UGM) and insulting rag mags. New\ndevelopments in and around college posed all sor\nof problems to students, staff and student news\nreporters. St Mary's Hospital Medical School\nmade their feelings known when they attended\nUGM en masse.\nFELIX1 Q1Q A million pound development project was planned for Imperial\nCollege Boat House. The Putney based development will provide\nimproved training facilities and changing rooms, a larger area for the\nstorage of boats, a workshop and a small hall of residence for Boat\nClub students. Staff and students mourned the death of Elaine Taylor,\nAdminister in the Kobler Unit. Mrs Taylor died of cancer on 16th of\nOctober. Further trouble was caused at London college's by Islamic\nextremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir. Meanwhile, five of the proposed\nSuperleague universities were announced. Sir Ronald Oxburgh,\nRector, admitted that Vice-Chancellors of Imperial, Oxford,\nCambridge, UCL and Warwick had met. He again scoffed at the\nrumours of an elite group being formed as he celebrated his 60th birthday. David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, spoke\npessimistically at a meeting of the Conservative Society about the\nNorthern Ireland peace process. ,\nI1DEC94 FELIX MM\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nHIV, controversy and a lot of money\nman describes the dissenting voices in AIDS research\nDecember l st was National\nAIDS Day. This came at the end\nof a year full of public debate and\ncontroversy about the disease.\nThe tenth International\nConference on AIDS was held\nlast August in Japan.\nIt's about 10 years since we\nstarted research into AIDS and\nthe big questions surrounding it.\nThat's a long time and a lot of\nmoney - over $3 billion in the\nUSA alone. That's a hell of a lot\nof money. So how much information does $3 billion buy?\nDepressingly little. The TV adverts, the billboards and the\nmagazine spreads have been\nshouting for years about what to\ndo, what not to do, who to sleep\nwith, what not to inject, how you\nget AIDS, what causes it.... Hold\non; stop right there.\nWhat causes AIDS? HIV,\nof course. Of course? Says who?\nMost of the experts do, but are\nthey right? We're all scientists\nhere - we all know the process.\nHypothesis, experiment, proof.\nIf HIV causes AIDS there must\nbe proof. With $3 billion's worth\nof loose change jangling in\nsomebody's pockets, the phenomenal amount of experimentation must have\nproved what causes AIDS? Sadly, this isn't the case.\nDr Kary Mullis, a chemist who was\nawarded a Nobel prize in 1993 for his\npioneering techniques on the large-scale\namplification of DNA, was asked to prepare a paper on AIDS for a conference. Like every\nwell-trained scientist, Mullis qualifies every\nstatement he makes with a reference. The\nopening sentence of his introduction stated\nthat HIV is thought to be the virus that causes\nAIDS. He thought he'd better reference this,\nand consequently sifted through every paper\nhe had on the subject to find out who had\noriginally discovered this. He drew a blank.\nThere was no original source.\nSo why do we assume that HIV causes\nAIDS? This would be a fair assumption if\nevery case of HIV resulted in AIDS, and every\ncase of AIDS was caused by HIV. Is this true?\nYes and no.\nTake the first statement. Every case of\nHIV results in AIDS. Cause and effect. But\nhow long are we giving HIV to produce\nAIDS? Two years, 5 years, 10 years? What if\nHIV has been present for 20 years before there\nis any sign of AIDS? Can we still be sure that\nit is involved ?\nResearchers at the Royal Free Hospital\nin London are studying a group of 111 people\nwith haemophilia who received blood\ncontaminated with HIV 13 years ago. The\ntime taken for them to develop AIDS has been\nmonitored. Statistics show that about a quarter of them will not develop symptoms for\n20 years. Up to a fifth won't get them for 25\nyears. Of those who were under 15 years at\nthe time of infection, one in eight could\nremain symptom less for over 30 years. Thirty\nyears is a long time. Anything could happen\nin a long time.\nMaybe something else that causes AIDS\nwill come along. HIV would still be present,\nbut its presence could be irrelevant; merely\ncoincidental. If the onset of AIDS could\noccur any time after infection with HIV, how\nlong shall we give it, exactly? Fifty years?\nSo what about the other way around?\nWhat if we can find a case of AIDS where the\nperson isn't infected with HIV? That would\nbe pretty conclusive, wouldn't it? So, is HIV\nalways there in every case of\nAIDS? Well, it is and it isn't. It's not that clear-cut.\nThe problem isn't epidemiological, it's linguistic. At\nthe moment, if a person who is\nHIV-negative develops problems\nwith their immune system then it's not strictly called AIDS. The\npresence of HIV has been\nincorporated into the definition of\nAIDS. This makes the high\ncorrelation between them taut-o logically contrived. It is\nimpossible to falsify the theory\nthat HIV causes AIDS because\neach is inherent in the definition\nof the other. So it's impossible to\nhave AIDS and not HIV, because\nof the way HIV has been defined.\nWe're going round in circles.\nPeople do acquire deficient or\nimpaired immune systems,\nthough. This renders them very\nsusceptible to infectious diseases\nand normally harmless bugs. The\nsymptoms sound suspiciously\nsimilar to those of AIDS. It's AIDS in everything but name. So,\nit appears that we do have cases of\nAIDS without HIV. Can we then\ndecide that HIV does not cause\nAIDS? We're on dod gy ground\nhere. Our case isn't strong enough to make\nany assumptions. The facts point to the idea\nthat HIV is not involved, but that's all it is: an\nindication.\nIt's becoming more than that. A handful of eminent scientists from all over the\nworld now share the dissenting view that HIV\nis not the cause of AIDS. Their rationale and\nopinions on why they don't subscribe to the\nuniversal HIV-AIDS theory is not widely\ncommunicated.\nThis is because they don't have a forum\nin which to do so. Most leading scientific and\nmedical journals refuse to publish these\ndissident arguments. They are worried that if\nthey publish such contradictory views then\npeople will ignore advice on changing sexual\nhabits. The editor of Nature, John Maddox,\nactively dissuades his journal from reporting\nany unorthodox views on AIDS.\nThe rebels have many interesting views\non what causes AIDS. They differ in the\nextent to which they reject the HIV theory.\nDr Peter Duesberg of the University of San\nFrancisco at Berkeley argues that-AIDS is not\ncaused by an infectious disease, but occurs as a EH FELIX "
