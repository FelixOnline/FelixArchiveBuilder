    "content": "2 FELIX PROFILE TONY WERNER The Chairman of the Social Clubs Committee is a complex character.\nTony Werner received his early fighting training\nat a prep school containing two fighting head-masters, one of whom was later awarded \u00a39,000\ndamages against the other. Tony, being head boy of\none half of the school, which half not specified,\nwas well to the fore in the battle. Prom there he\nwent to Bradfield where after some study he took\nHigher 3choo l Oert in Modern Languages and History.\nHis chief claims to distinction at school were an\nappearance on T.V. as a slave, the founding a Conservative Society and the somewhat eccentric\npastime of tree-felling.\nFrom Bradfield Tony went to the Borbonne and\nstudied there in the Faculty of Science for nine\nmonths. The class consisted of 200 men and 200\nyoung ladies, an opportunity for experience of\nwhich he was not slow to avail himself. Again\nhe founded a Conservative Society and having .\nnarrowly escaped arrest he was hailed to the Surete\nto account for subversive political activities. After\na short time he returned to England, though he was\nnot actually deported.\nHe then studied elementary science and obtained a School Certificate in'' hemis try at the third attempt.\nFor part time employment he worked as store man for a firm of strategic metal dealers and was offered a job back-stage at a Hammersmith music hall.i 'he\nnature of his duties in this post have never been\nexplained.\nTony came .to I.C. in October '52 and took part\nin the last intermediate course in the college.\nDuring that year he became Barman & President of\nConnaught Hall. In '53-'54 he was President of the\nPolitical Society and then this session he became\nChairman of the Social Clubs Committee. Once again\nhe founded a Conservative Society and now serves as\nits Treasurer. He has for the past two years been\na member of the executive of L.D. C.A., and is also\nEditor of the R.S. M. Journal.\nIt ,i as been noted that Tony is of a complex nat-ure. His tastes, are rather more catholic than the\naverage students. ^'hl8 serves both himself and us\nfull well in his administration of the Social Clubs.\nBeing half Scandanavian and half Irish Tony has\nan ln borne love of travel, he has ranged over most\nof Europe and visited Hong Kong, Siam and Greenland.\nWhen not otherwise engaged he resides in Nice. He\nspeaks French, Scandanavian languages and English\noccasionally. When in London he lives in a flat that defies description, little of it being visible due to the mass of books, papers, crockery, sundry\nequipment and bottles that covers everything.\nTony has interesting tastes in wine, women and\nsong. As for the first he is a confirmed imbibe r of cognac, in the direction of the second his activities must be subversive since there is little to\nbe seen of them around oo lle ge. He is reputed to\nhave a tendency towards brunettes with blue eyes,\nthough at present is showing a passing fancy for blondes. As for song, his taste is Slav music. Ho\nalso collects stamps and traction engines. His\nprincipal dislike is having to arrive in time for\n9.30 lectures, a foible he shares with other Mlslag\nGeologists.\nPHOENIX REVIEW FLASH!!\nThe Photographic Society announces an\nadditional Lunchtime Lecture entitled \"Electronic\nPlash without Cash(almost)!\" This is given\nby C.W. PLATTEN of Leeds University, who will demonstrate his 2 home-constructed 35 Joule out-fits( costing under \u00a35 each), together with\ncolour slides.\nNote the date: Thursday 24th Feb. at\n1.10 p.m. in Botany Lecture Theatre.\nThere are four very good reasons for buying\nthis term's \"Phoenix\". They are four photographic reproductions in the centre, showing past\nand future aspects of Prince Consort Road and its vicinity. These four are far more eloquent and\ninteresting than the accompanying article, and\nlikely to be oo. ue classics later on.\nBut \"Phoenix\" is a literary publication, and\non that count it fails miserably this time. There\nare seven articles which one presumes represent\nthe best literary talent in I.C. today, and not\nmore than two of them are worth a critic's: praise.\nPeter Howe talks fondly, and in that characteristic\noas u al tone of his, about tre in s on the Continent,\nand manages to be interesting without being eff u sive. Vers Atkinson relates two amusing episodes\nabout The Rozzers, but is plainly under a strain\nto link up the t. vo somehow. The only poem,\n\"December\", has obviously been written in that month,\nand of course has no rhyme or form.\nThree articles have been written oy obvious\nenthusiasts. Tne one on gliding was tile only one\nto arouse any real interest in me, alt no ugh I have\nseen a glider only once in my life. One u o out rowing in a summer race tries vainly to .j& ite it sound heroic, and could only arouse a faint bore-dom. The two authors use pseudonyms. The third\narticle is initialled, and is a plain, alu e it jell written account of a Deep oe a Cruise.\n'The Daily Round1\nby \"One of t neu rag on s\" and 'You, Too, Can '}eA Willing Customer' by\nii.C. Kale are both lig nt near ted in a labour ed sort of way. The latter further suffers from\nin different proofreading.\n\"A Mining Juggernaut\" by Ivingdon is a forthright account of the mines' traction engine's history and prospects. I could not, however,\nagree with some philo sop ny about mascots which he\nhas put forward in the opening paragraph. Tne\nother reviews, taking ten out of the forty pages,\nare uniformly dull. There is a sincere tribute\nto the memory of Sir Roderic Hill, with a good\nphotograph.\nThe photographs are t ne main value in this\nissue. The rest is just garnishing. fl \u201e\nENG. SOC. DINNER. Two weeks ago, the Engineering Society of City\nand Guilds College held its Annual Dinner. There was\na new idea in the al ra daring Idea, to judge by the\nwidespread dissent lon and it was to make the Dinner\nformal.\"A monkey-Jacketted affair..?.... What snobbery*... How ridiculous.... Impossible, of course..,.\n.... etc,...etc...,\", said the critical, amongst them\nthe author. But, however critical he was, he went,\nbe o a use he has enjoyed every other Guild's society\nDinner.\n\"They'll s it on their chairs with cellophane\nprotecting those precious Dinner Jackets, In fact,\nthe whole evening will be the most depressing one\nthey've ever sst through\", was a much-voiced opinion*\nThe formal informality; the very warmth and\neet it rl vl all ty surpassed the wildest hopes of the\nOrganisers.

    "content": "FELIX\nSPORTS EDITORIAL It must be glaringly obvious to the minority of\nImperial College students who take an active interest in some sport that there has been a decline of\nathletic prowess within the college. Gone are the\ndays when Felix was publishing with regularity the\nlist of U.L. cups won by I.C. clubs. So fair this\nseason we have yet to record a single cup and the\nfuture is not particularly overflowing with an a bun dance of cups ready to drift through the portal e of I.C. Let us examine a few details of our inglorious\nrecord. The college was s tru oka heavy blow between\nthe eyes when the Rugby club was beaten in the 1st. round of the U.L. competition by U.C. The cup, which\nhas been in our possession for three years will find\nit hard living in its new surroundings, and we hope\nthat next year it will be returned to its permanent\nresidence. The Hookey Club, whit fh at one time had\na monopoly of the U.L. cup, have also fallen vio tim s to U.C. The U.L. cross country championships were another\nopportunity for U.C. to give a demonstration of their\nsuperiority in this sport. I.C. can boast seo on d hon--ours in the U.L. championships, but this falls short\nof previous years when wo were regular holders of the\ncup.\nWe are sure I.C. supporters were disappointed when\nthe Soccer club were beaten by the odd goal in the\nsemi-final by Goldsmiths'. This was our last oha no e of holding one of the winter o ups. The Squash o lub have reached the semi-final of the U.L. competition,\nbut they have strong opponents In St. Mary's, tha\nother semi-finalists.\nThe Boxing club, making a welcome return, put up\na gallant effort in the U.L. championships but were\nnever expected to emerge as winners. With tha continued support that they are getting, they could win\nthese championships neat year.\nAnd ro on to our remaining chances. Tha Sailing\no lub cup seems to have oom e to I.C. to stay, a stay\nlikely to- continue. The Boat Olub atl ll remains one\nof I.C. 'is strongest potentialities In sport, ooo e al on ally rising to the heights of national fans.\nLet it be said now that every honour oom lng tha way\nof the Boat Club has been won by 'a hear' hard work,\nenthusiasm, and the nt riot training programme Itn-po sod upon them by the arduous natura of their\nsport. FJOiII w ls hae i them all tha bait in tha near\nfuture Head of the hiver.\nHowever, the fa ots are laid before ua, and wa must\ntake our hate off to U.C, as the top college of\nsport in the University today. Suooeaa la only a limited quantity and bso au ce of this wa cannot ba\ntoo harsh on our own sportsman who, having passed\nthrough a region or dominance o var tha other a oll age a have now to ba content with watching the luo o a a i of\nothers. In a university with a regular throughput\nof students, tha fluctuations of university a port ara wide and o a noh ange rapidly from yaar to year)\nand what one university gains another lot as. Ovar tha\npost war years I.C. have had many good sportsman and\nif the outflow of tha past two years has bean gra at er than the Inflow, than we must fight harder to\nreplace the lost one a by mora training and are aru it ment of those we fear are hiding their lights behind\na brown bushel. If ready made athletes are not be lag supplied to our sports clubs then tjl MY. nu*t ore ate some. Moreover, skill dos s not count for all that\ngoes into a victory, let\"? have plenty mora spirit. TABLE TENNIS The 1st team have reached the final of tha\nCaribbean Cup competition, and must now meat\nWoolwich I, who are strong favourites for tha\ncup. In the semi-final, I.C. beat King'sI81 which was a up rl singly one-sided in view\nof the result of the league mato h earlier this\nseason when Kings wen 6 - 4 . For I.C., games\nwere won by Shoalb (3),Wilson (3),Amatya (2).\nSpeolal mention must be made af K.aU tea ib,a Pakistan international, who pulled off a magnificent a oh i \u00abv*ue nr_ by winning tha British Universities championship. Ha i a believed ta o> the first I.C. player aver to tinto la event.\nRUG GER The first fifteen has played extremely well\nreo ent ly. Their bao ks showed magn if io ent form\nagainst London Springboks and the mato h was won\n14-0. Palmer, Bell and pontin scored five tries. A satisfactory revenge was gained over U.C. who wore defeated 3--0. A fine 40-yard penalty\nby Lewis decided the match.\nProbably their best performance of the season\ncame last Saturday, when before a large crowd\nat Richmond Athletic Ground they held Richmond\nVikings to a score of 8-i. But for Injuries and\nthe claims of U.L.,I. C. might well have brought\noff a surprise win. This is the sort of performance wh i oh does mu oh for the o lub'a reputation.\nThe \"a\", being depleted by players' injuries and\npromotions to the seo on d XV, lost to Port of London\nAuthority, after a valiant..but inexperienced game.\nLast Saturday they lost 9-0 to Old Haberdashers in a very evenly matched game, enjoyed by all. The 2nd XV sustained a defeat from Bank of\nEngland. Dan's team hats shown a complete contrast in the last two weeks. First, a oom ple te shambles with a mass of reserves and old or oo ke(i no lu ding one who did not turn up until half-time) , they lost53 to P.L.A. Then, despite\nthe Carnival, they ran up au o ore of 39 again at Slough, in brilliant fashion.\nThe B IX van 12 - 0 by brute force and ignorance*\nSOCCER Following tha defeat In the a emi fl nal of the\no up the Int. team suffered another setback In\ntheir bid for tha league oha apl on a hip suffering\ntheir first league dafa at of tha season, losing\nto L.8.E.23. On Saturday on a vary poor pl teh tha lat, XI\ndrew with Blrkbaok 4 - 4 , the forwards hit everything\nexcept the goals and had they bean more accurate\nan easy victory would have been obtained.\nHOCKEY Stephenson Uuui,\nQuiIda beat HQS 4-0.\nThe first mato h in tha inter-oo lle ge hp okay competition on Feb. 9th resulted in a win for Guilds.\nThe Guilds' team tried at tao king from the\nstart but did not get very far until some hard\nwork by their o entre half and inside forwards\nhad the H. C.S.b a ok s out of position. The\n3.0,9, forwards had as mu oh play as their opponents but never looked really dangerous, even\nwhen the Guilds goalkeeper allowed the ball to\nrebound from one of hie goalposts.\nThe ee o on d half started with the so ore at\n2-0 in the Guildsmen's favour. soon after, a uci rum in the H.O. S.o i role resulted in another\nred goal, but it was only after the ball had\ntravelled the length of the field many,times\nthat Owen with a first time shot from a short-oo rner took the ao or a to 4-0. so ended an\nenjoyable game wh i oh allowed Guilds to average\ntheir defeat of last year.\nVov are pert on the activities ef I.O.

    "content": "FELIX\ns. JAZZ HOP The I.C. Jazz club hop was the first hop\nof its kind at I.C. The informal jazz groups\nat carnivals have become more popular over the\nlast two years as have the jazz numbers played\nby the bands at I.C. hops. Having an all jazz\nhop now ever was an entirely different thing but\nthe numbers of people who attended must have\ndispelled any doubts the jazz club committee may\nhave had about the success of the evening.\nThe fact that the main band, the Birmingham University Rhythm, Club were not a traditional jazz group may or may not have been a good thing\nfor the first hop of this kind. It did give\nthe people who did not want to jive some dancing,\nbut unfortunately people jiving and people doing the foxtrot or quickstep ad.0 not get on well\ntogether on the same floor. The guest band which played down in the\nbar provided a relief for this situation. They\nalways played very good traditional jazz and were\nin my opinion the better band. We may well see\nmore of them at I.C. Altogether the dance was about the brightest\ndan oe at Qa :,r et. Too much so I think, lis far a ii Miss Pry was concerned, but the Qa bar seeded\nto do a good trade.\nThe Birmingham Rhythm club and their sixty\nsupp or: ers left London at 12.30 with two of their\nmembers travelling by courtesy of metropolitan\npolice.

During the Vac. the\nbuilders will move into the Refectory and Upper\nDining Hall. At the same time the old Upper\nand Lower Entrances and the Bar will be closed.\nThus, at one blow we will have lost the one\nremarking central rallying point common to all I.C.

Circulation:1200 It has given us considerable pleasure to see\nthe favourable manner in which the national press\nhas received the N.U.S. report on undergraduate\ngrants.\nThese grants were last reviewed in1951 i and with the appreciable rise in cost of living sino e then there is a definite case for an increase\nin maintenance grants at the present time. N.U.S. say the rise in essential expenditure for students\nresident in London has been 14$ sino e1951, we\nwould say it was nearer 20$.\nWe all know personally of genuine oases of distress caused by\neconomic difficulties; in many instances the only\naction a student o an take is to deliberately lower his standard of living, when all that is needed\nis an extra \u00a3 30 per annum. At the same time\nthe Ministry of Education could place the County\nawards on a more level basis.\nAs students we\nare already a pri vili ged bran oh of the community,\nbut here there is a genuine grievance, which could\nbe supported at the highest level. Everybody will agree that the two building alterations we describe in this issue are excellent ideas.. The extra refectory space is urgently needed, and the new centre for the Union\nwill provide us with something that has been\nlacking all year. The Unwin Building is cent ral to all three Colleges, and should make us\na fine temporary home.\nALICE COMES TO TOWN Alice and her colourful friends presided over the\nR.C. B. Carnival last Friday. The theme, being based on\na literary masterpiece, Is a new and very practical\nIdea, a welcome change away from the proverbial cowboys\nand Indians.\nThe standard of scenery was extremely high and it Is pleasing to note that there was an absence of wanton\ndestruction during the evening. - Excluding of course\nthe bricks and snowballs which were flying across the\ntennis court between 2 and 5 a.m.! The scenes portrayed by the K.U.o' s artists are tar\ntoo numerous to men tian but here is an outline:\nin The queen's Palace (the ij nac K Bar j we saw the\nHatter's Tea party, the ill thy Toves, the Lobster and\nthe li ry ph on, the nal rus and his pal the Carpenter and\nvarious representations og the tue en of Hearts and her\nplaying card courtiers. Last, but not by a long way\nleast, was the Oyster Bed - slice's answer to the Caveman's cave.\nThe centre of attraction In the Panelled Hall was\nthe fluorescent Cheshire Cat which, thanks to Science\nNOT HOhLICKb and Ultra violet light, beamed on the revellers\nfrom 9 until 7.\nThe 'playing Card' idea was exploited to the full in the fancy dress parade. Especially w oF t thy of mention\nwere the black Bishop and his attractive partner whose dress\nconsisted BOLiiLY of the pa^es from 2j editions of AllceJ\nii lso John Conway-Jones and his complete suit of cards.\n.tb out90 couples plus the 'Boys' enjoyed this Carrolllne\nCarnival, Here's to the next one in ten months time!!\nPoints of interest':\n1) Cassandra was a Wonderland Bar maid\n11) An F.G. I, agent WaB present\n111) Tickets are still on sale if anyone would like a souvenir. From A. Falrburn price One Guinea\nless 10% discount if paid within one week lei soy' stow** Where would you go for half-session ?\n- I. C.W. A. goes West 1\nOur President was extracted from the\nbar last Friday night to take a long\ndistance call from Penzance - two young\nlady mathematicians wished to claim the\nLondon-Fenzance hitch-hiking record -- fifteen hours (wearing trousers).\nCan YOU beat this ? FELIX offers male\netude nts( wearing a skirt) a small prize\nIf they can beat this. \u00a3\u00a3\nP The passage way through Imperial Institute . to\nR.C.S. has now been closed owing to'heating arran jg ment s'. However, a passageway on a higher level\nexists round the side of the Geat Hall. Instead of\nturning right into the'tunnel', one now goes on\nanother 50 yards, up the steps, along the passage\nand down and out through the same door used in the\nother route.\n\u00a3 Coffee has gone up to 5d. Tea has gone up to 4d. Provided that the brewers do not raise their prices,\na safe assumption for the time being, beer will soon\nbe cheaper. Perhaps O.u ee nie'8 will soon be known\nMoonie's too. Mrs. Bowling (Queenie) will leave\nAyrton Hall Refectory after Easter to run the new\nstaff refectory in Queens Gate. Mr. Mooney. will then take over all responsibility for College\nRefectories.\n\u00a3, FELIX is becoming much maligned by the other\nLondon University press. SENNET stated last issue\nthat N.E.C. pinched Felix from I.C. instead of\nPhoenix. Q.U. C. has printed our Guide/to the\nGalleries without acknowledgement. BEDFORD NEWS\nand SENNET both used this - but with acknowledge--ment.\nWe hear that the brighter lights of the Chemical\nEngineering Department have been conducting some\nresearch into the horse power of the Imperial College student. The time taken for selected specimens\nto mount the known height of stairs from bottom to\ntop of the department is measured with a stop watch,\nthe weight of the participant is noted, and the\nresults converted into ft-lb/sec and so into horse-power, i Redoubtable' Rugger types have clocked over\none and a quarter H.P. \u00a3 There is much pleasure in noting that two guineas\nwas paid in \"conscience money\" to the Guilds Entertainments committee by someone who had gate crashed their Carnival and repented.\n\u00a3\u00a3 During the day, on Tuesday the 8th, a PERAMBULATOR\nwas observed by the door of the Zoology Department\nadjoining that part of the Hostel where I.e.*. A.live. Congratulations to the happy mother and may her\nCounty Education Committee be confounded.\nSPORT: I.C. W.S.C Only one hockey nat ch has been played since Christ-mas, against Q. K.C. in rather damp conditions. The\nresult was 5 - u to the opponents.\nRather more netball has occurred, but with only\nena win, against Battersea Polytechnic 16 - 11.\nthe squash team, although 1suing to L.S.E., Bris t ol University, and St.Mary's Hospital, beat fest-- field convincingly. A thunderstorm was, however,\nnecessary to put the opposition off.\nThe boat club have entered for a regatta in May,\nbut optimism has been damped by the resignation of\ntheir coach.\nOf ICDSC, Maureen Hawes, Margaret Brown and Janet\nPstoreon, play netball, squash, and swim for the\nUniversity respectively.\nD.
