    "content": "FELIX\nSELKIRK HALL A CLOSED SHOP ? *\nThe following unsc lio it ed letter\nwas given to the Editor of Felix,\nby its author. After reading it, and being a little dubious about the\nso a e what personal remarks made in it and acting on a suggestion contained\nwithin the letter itself, the Editor\nsought a more official view of the\nSelkirk Hall situation.\nThis of fi oi al statement is te\nbe seen below following the original\nletter. I think it should be added\nthat this statement, although termed\noff io al, is not by one of the 3\ngentlemen named.\nDear Editor,\nFor the first time for a considerable number of years Selkirk Hall, the\nI.C. College hostel in Holland Park,\nis to be opened to postgraduate students.\nWhether or not this is a good proposition remains to be seen, and it is_/ not my purpose to comment on it here.\n.Next year will also be the first year\nof office of a warden from the Administrative Staff and it would be as\nwell to point out that the warden is solely responsible for selecting\napplicants for admission to Selkirk.\nThe wider terms of admission\nhave not been made public to member!\nof the Union in general, indeed it was\nonly by chance that the present\nresidents of Selkirk were informed.\nThose Selkirk residents who are\nto become postgraduate students next\nyear and who wished to return n \u00bbxt\nSession, re-applied for admission and\nwere, for the main part, accepted.\nTo the best of ay knowledge only\nthree postgraduate applications were\nBade from outside Selkirk. These were\nforwarded by Mr. J. Bell( Sec. I.C.. Union), Mr. H. Espig (Chairman S. C.C.) and Mr. R. Garnett (Pres. I.C. Union.).\nOf these three, Mr. Espig and Mr.\nGarnett have been accepted far residence.\nI understand that the reason for having\npostgraduates in Selkirk is that they\nmight be a guiding influence on undergraduates in their work, and also to\nact as a\"P.G. sta aut governing body\"\nto run the hostel.\nThese are the facts as I know\n\u2022nc1I wish to make the following'\noom ment s: Firstly Mr. Garnett has already\nhad three years' residence in the new\nhostel, the marl mum permissible for a Onion President in a College hostel'.\nHe is also a College Demonstrator and\nwill undoubtedly have enough funds to\nafford alternative accommodation.\nSecondly, I read in the \"Times\"\nthat Mr. Espig has been awarded a Beit Fellowship of \u00a3600/annum. The\nsane oom ment s as above apply. Thirdly\ntrp to now it has not been found necessary to provide undergraduates a guiding hand. Nor is it necessary.\nStudents are chosen students on those\nqualities which will enable then to\nwork and manage their lives in a responsible manner. \"Big Broth**\"\ntact ioe will not bring the erring student to heel.\nFourthly, it has .\na general principle that residents\nshould be selected in equal numbers fr em each constituent College, and that once\naoc ep ted, providing there is no misc on duct, he will remain in residence for\ntwo years. This year, however, a Kinor\nafter only -j year' at Selkirk, has been\ntold that he will be unable to return\nowing to the excessive number of Hinesmen. It would therefore appear that\nhe is being pushed out in favour of Mr.\nGarnett, who is also a Minesman.\nFifthly, certain residents at Selkirk\nhave been invited back for a third year,\ndespite the fact that it is generally\nunderstood and laid down in tie rules\nfor Admission of Residents 1959/60,\nthat two years is the maximum period\nof residence in a College hostel for a student not holding Union office.\nI feel, Mr. Editor, that these\nremarks speak for themselves and that\nyour members of I.C. will be able to\ndraw their own conclusions.\n1 should here mention that the\nfact that I am a resident at Selkirk\nin no way colours my opinions, since\nI shall be undertaking P.G. studies\nat King's College, Newcastle next Session. I3 hall be grateful for any\ncorrection that can be made to\" the\ncontent of this letter, and would also\nwe lee a ea reply from those in a position so to do.\nTours sincerely,\nR.D. Leigh\nMining 3.,\n(1) There has been no change in the\nmethod of selection at Selkirk.\nHow then has anything been kept\ni ju iet?(2) The addition of a few P.G.'a merely\nbrings Selkirk into line with the\ngeneral College policy as adopted\nin the other hostels.\n(3) Next year there will be five residents from each 'Constitueat College.\n(4) The 2-year limit of residence\napplies to the Beit Hall and Garden\nHall.\n(5) Some of the people who have been\nturned down for residence next year-have been so treated on the advice\nof the retiring warden and others.\n(6) At \u00a327 per term, Selkirk is not th J cheapest place to live at. Perhaps all students with parents earning in excess of say \u00a32,000 p.a. or with grants of \u00a3350 p.a. or f core should be restricted from application to any College hostel*\n(7) Any Resident's Committee wh i oh may be elected, will boe lao ted from the students sad by- the\nstudents. There seems net-reason why any such oo a a it t as should not operate in the Same\nunobtrusive manner as the equivalent oom mitte es at the other\nX.C. Hostels.\n(8) In addition to the above named\napplicants for residence next year\nthere were at least ten other\nP.G.' s, not resident in Salkirk, s reasonable number it would seem\nfor the two places which were award-ed. It is difficult to imagine\nwhy Mr. Leigh should a hoo se to\nmention only one of the unsuccessful applicants unless the sour\u2014\naes s of this particular grape (to\nuse as oae what mixed metaphor)\nis related to the position of res- -pon sibi lit y to wh i oh that person\nhas been elected.\n(9) Under the rules of a dra is sion to\nSelkirk Hall a student is not refused because he has already res i ded for the ma.xi mum period in the\nBeit Hall, since Selkirk Hall ia\nentirely separate from the other\nHalls of Residence at I.C. Perhaps spending one's time running a Union, for which the only immediate\nreward is the satisfaction of having\ndone the work, for the likes of Mr.\nLeigh should thus exclude one from even\napplying far the fao ili ties open to\nall members of the Union. It is a pity that &. Leigh has now left it too late to do anything more construe-I.C.D. S. The I.C. Draaatio\u2022Society is the\nfirst non-Irish Society to visit Portrush, Northern Ireland, for the amateur\nseason of Portrush Summer Theatre.\nImperial College is perhaps the\npremier scientific oo lle ge of England,\nand ia one of the largest constituent\ncolleges of London University. It i a also remarkable for having a large\npreponderance of men students - in a ratio of about 60:1.\nThe Society has produced a variety\nof plays, f ram standard repertory o omo dies to the London premier of \"L0FTUR\",\nJohana Sigurjonsson's Icelandic vera ioa of the Faust legend. In the last year,\nthey have ranged from Moliere's \"THE\nMISER\" to Shakespeare's \"THE TAMHB OF\nTHE SHREW\".\nThe Society ia a regular competitor\nin the London University Drama Festivals.\nThe Society will present two play*\nby Battigan under his general heading\n\"PLATBILL\" These are \"HARLEC.UITJUS\"\nand \"TH1 BROWNING VERSION\"\nBRITISH MEDICAL STUDENTS' ASSOCIATI0JI\nDANCE ALL-NIGHT SESSION\nChislehurst Caves, Friday June 12th Tickets may be obtained i a advance - see Details on Large Poster in year College - price 3/6d.

    "content": "mix\nmS mmm SECURITY INFORMATION\nDear Sir,\nIt ia time that this u nspe ska bl s arista was revealed. To the South of\nthe Uniop Building there lies a plot\nconsisting of a beautifully maintained\nmosaic of building a it e turves, known\nas the Beit Quadrangle Lawn. Apart\nfrom Tortoise racing, this stretch of\nverdant pasture has an important\nfunction - to connect the Serology\nDepartment to the Bar. A glance\nat the plan aa seen from the Zoology\nroof, from the left of the dustbins,\nwill show that the route to the Bar\nfrom this seething animal container,\nis very indirect. Those readers with\nan inherent ma theme,';io al ability will quickly calculate, and drinkers will see immediately, that if the paths\nhad been built the other way around\nwith the present South end to the\nNorth, then our route to the foe-trail\nand dart board would have been easier.\nWho is to blame? It is obvious\nthat the Staff of Zoology have thought\nup this cunning ruse as a deterrent to\ntheir worthy soho lars' relaxation.\nNow what difference does this make,\nyou readers are asking? Why, the in human wastage of five seo on ds time per\nday - valuable time w hio his meant for\ndrinking and dart play. (Incidentally,\nit is sino e rely hoped that all who read\nthis will show reverence to the word\n'dart', by devoutly removing their o oats raising their glasses and repeating my\nwell-known toast of \"Right then, down\nthe old er - right then.\" may I take\nthis opportunity of answering the continuously occurring question as to why\nI drink. I do so for the sake of\nmedical science, to ensure that the\ncolours of my stomach wall are perfectly preserved. To this aim I can tin-reservedly recommend the hobby of\nbeer tasting.)\nSolutions to problem:-i) Turn the Quad around,\nii) Turn the Quad buildings around\nill) PLOTL. (Pipe line under the\nlawn.\niv) Open a bar in the Zoology Dept.\nI see that the Bar is open again,\nand so I dip my dart point is the ink\nonce more to remain,\nTours um ciaa sed ly, Charles Neville, Dart.\nELECTIONS It can hardly have escaped not ioe that elections are with us again.\nThe not ioe boards have been inflicted\nwith a series of election lists covered\nwith a rash of grubby, unreadable\nsignatures. The internal not ioe board\ncarries a series of smarmy profiles of\nwould-be bureaucrats, identified by\nleering photographs. One would think\nthat this was Scotland lard's rogues\ngallery, were it not for the fact that\nthe profile rarely corresponds to a true\ndescription of the subject.\nProfile writers are a strange bread,\nworthy to s it in on the most diplomatic\nuh ember. They sell their man with the\nair of a seasoned a uti one er, loyally\nhiding all his faults and boosting his\nassets, to such a degree that the whole\nthing becomes a downright lie. Why\ndo they do it? One reason of o our se is free beer and cigarettes. It is the\ndone thing for the prospective candidate\nto invite his loyal supporters to the\nbar at least once a week. Another\nreason is that the profiler likes to\nthink that he is the power behind the\nthrone. Tet a third reason is tn at he\nbelongs to a clique wh i oh wants to keep\nor gain power. The following is a typical example of a clique at work.\nB proposes A for president and C and D second him. A proposes C for\nsecretary and B and D second him.\nD proposes B for treasurer and A and C seo on d him. C proposes D for commit te< member and A and B seo on d him.\nc \u00ae\nBelieve me, it usually works.\nNow What about these candidates who\nallow themselves to be displayed and\nlauded in su oha fashion. What are they\nafter? Partly of o our se it is power,\nbut the most important reason is that\nthey want to be \"a somebody \". THEY WANT TO BE KNOWN. To be just an ordinary\nstudent, a nobody, serving on no commit-tees, is to them a sign of absolute\nfailure. Even if they only become hen.\njunior assistant treasurer of the\nmadrigal revivalist society they have\nbecome as or ac bo&y. The most pa the tio case of the nobody who wants to become a somebody is the man who gets himself proposed for\n6 posts, hoping that he might get on at\nleast one. To see him slinking away as\nthe election results confirm him an\nincurable nobody is a sight to tear at\nyour heart strings.\nPersonally, I am a self-appointed\nnobody and intend remaining so. Would\nan v body o are to propose me for president?\n8\nResearch Lab.,\nZoology Dept.\nw^ l* Wa.ll D ochs r,I*c d\\^r \u00bb rV. a e\\ when, "

This proposed society\nhas received a great deal of pub lio it y in 'Felix' this year and I feel it is time that someone cleared up the controversy surrounding it. The view*\nexpressed in these letters and those of\nMr. Finney earlier this session are a blatant misrepresentation of the truth\nand are probably based on rumour rather\nthan on fao t. It is a pity that\nsupposedly educated people cannot check\nup on their information before writing\nhasty letter* to \u2022Felix'.\nThe Peso* Society was not rejected\nby Union Council. When I informed the\nCouncil that the first reading of the\nPeaea Sooiety had been passed by the\nS. C.C., the members expressed no view*.\nAt the next meeting of the S. C.C.a number of societies stated that they\nwere already doing what the proposed\nao ole ty was setting out to do. The\nS. C.C.w hi oh consists of 40 member*\ntherefore rejected the Peace Sooiety\nbecause there is no need to have a new ao oie ty which duplicates the work\nof existing societies. It is surprising that Mr. Finney, the proposer of\nthe Peaoe Sooiety, did not approach\nthese societies to see what is being\ndon* on the topic for Peace in the Union\nbefore trying to form it. The Internations!

    "content": "THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION No 135 END OF TERM EDITION - SUMMER, 1959. 4d KINGS EDITOR REPLIES\nThe Editor of this newspaper was\nvery pleased to ree i eve the following\nletter from the Editor of \"King\"3 News\",\nas a result of the front-page art iole that appeared.\nDear Sir,\nI read with interest your frontpage art iole in your issue of May 22nd concerning or it ic is m of \"Felix\". As\nEditor of a printed oo lle ge newspaper,\nI feel that these criticisms are fair.\nYou justify your paper's appearance\nby saying that whereas \"Felix\" makes a profit, if \u00a32 o an be o all eda profit,\nthe glossy \"PI\" costs its Union Society\nbetween \u00a3200 and \u00a3400 a year. While\nthis may be true of \"PI\" and other\noo lle ge newspapers, it is certainly not\ntrue of \"King's News\", the newspaper of\nKing's College Union Society. During\nthe last year, our total trading loss\nhas amounted to under ten pounds, al though fifty pounds has been spent on\nof floe equipment. Our circulation is only 1,100, and the paper only, oost a its readers three pence. \u2022\nWhy is it that our loss is only a minute fraction of that of \"Pi\"?\nThere are two reasons. Firstly, \"King's News\" is not a glossy newspaper. It is printed on ordinary newsprint, w hio hI feel is more suited to a newspaper than\nthe heavier magazine paper used by so\nmany university and oo lle ge newspapers.\nSecondly, \"King's News\" is not printed\nin London. While this has its disadvantages in the make-up of the paper\n- we do not see any proofs of the paper\n- it is certainly a lot cheaper.\nBy making these two economies, we\nare able to survive without making a serious loss. However, to print a newspaper in this way still costs money.\nThis is where advertising plays its part. The printing bill for our paper\ncomes to an average of \u00a353 per issue,\nof wh i oh five-sixths is paid for by\nadvertising. If you are so set against\nadvertising, then of o our se you cannot\nhope to publish a printed paper; but\nsurely it is better to have advertising in an attractive newspaper, than no\nadvertising in an unattractive paper.\nSo, I regard your excuse as a rather weak excuse. If one oo lle geo an publish a good newspaper without\nwaving a serious loss, then surely another o an. It is only fair to point cut\nthat if Imperial College want a real\nnewspaper, they will have to pay before\nthey reap the benefit. For changeover oo ul d not be done for nothing.\nFinally, I would like to reinforce your remarks concerning weekly\npublication. It is all very well for\nthose w no read a paper: few realise\nthe time and trouble that goes into publishing a paper, or how difficult it sometimes is to fill all the gaps even\nin a fortnightly publication.\nYours faithfully,\nDavid J. Hardwiok,\nEditor, \"King's News\"\nA re-reading of both my own front\npage article and the above letter has\nled me to agree that the argument I put\nforward about advertising was a weak\none; however, it is true that no big\nadvertiser would wish to appear in a paper produced by the present process.\nTo attract big advertisers - such\nas appear in the King's newspaper, we\nshould first have to turn out a printed\n\"Felix\" - i.e. this means an initial outlay of o a pital. It depends on the\nUnion as to whether this is eventually\ndone.\nI should like to thank the Editor\nof King's News very much for his\ninteresting letter and I think that\nhe may have given the Felix Board some-thins to consider carefully.\nTHE MAY BALL\nThere is no doubt that the First\nImperial College May Ball, which was\nplanned in the face of severe student\npessimism, was an unqualified su coe s s. The fa\u00abt that the 300 double tickets\nwere sold within 4 days and that first year students were in the majority do\nprove undoubtedly that there is space\nin the I.C. soo i al calendar for an\nAnnual May Ball.\nThe Entertainments Committee is one of the oost hard-worked and least-rewarded committees in the Union and I should like to record here my thanks to\nthem, and especially John Sheldon the\nChairman and Susan Coombs the Secretary.\nIt is to these two, with their imagination and relentless hard work, that we\nowe the su coe s s of the First Annual May\nBall.\nR.H. T. Qarnett\nPresident, I.C. Union.\n\u2022 CHADWICK IAN SInspired by Mr. John Chadwiok'sdio tum that \"Constitutent college mascots should be removed to a safe p laos as a reminder of the hooliganism s of the\npast\", several members of R.C.S. moved\nthe Guilds Spanner to one of the most\npea oe ful spots in the British Isles.\nSeeing the events of Field Cup after-noon, an anonymous geologist decided to\nwalk off with the Guilds Clark-high\nimplement, and did so, after which it was rapidly transported to the Hostel,\nand, the next morning, to N0 rth Wales.\nApparently a large red and silver\nspanner is a great asset while hitch-hiking, as motorists stop out of shear\ncuriosity - the result being that it reached the Pen-y Pass Hotel in the\nLlanberis Pass that same evening,\nand the summit of Snowdon before night-fall. The only hitch in the operation was that the removing squad\nfailed to get back down to the Peny-Cwiyd Hotel before closing time.\nThe spanner now rests high above the\nconflicts of mankind, secure from any\nbut the most determined hooliganism,\nand seems likely to remain there for\nsome time; a situation of w hio hall keen Chadwiokians should thoroughly\na on rove. P.K. TRAGIC DEATHWe would like to express our deep\nregret at the death of George Fraser, who]\ndemonstrated his skill as an athlete and\nas one of Britain's greatest climbers,\nduring his period as aP.G. in Guild's last year.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 3\nEXAM IN IT1S Peeling nervy, depressed? Suffering from vague emotions of foreboding\nand guilt? The oha noes are you have\nexam in lt is, a seasonal disease wh i oh claims thousands about this time, and\nhas even been known to be fatal. This\nmalady strikes by destroying the confidence and self-resp eot of the sufferer,\nlaying him open to subsidiary attacks of\nswot ting, fear of failure, worry and the\nhysterical reactions to these. The\nbasic cure is therefore to restore the\nvictim's confidence: and the methods of\ndoing this o an be divided into two\nclasses:-i) Methods based on increasing\nhis internal confidence\nii) Methods designed to destroy\nthe confidence of others.\n1. Under the first head a variety of\ntreatments include:\na. Learn with extreme thoroughness a minute fraction of the syllabus, wh i oh engenders confidence out of all proportion to the effort involved.\nb. Obtain one past examination paper\nand work out how to do the questions\nabout six months before the exam.\nThen, whenever an attack threatens,\nlook at this paper and think how easy\nit is.o. Alcohol.\n2. Under the second head may be\nincluded:\na. Disappear from the college 8 days\nfrom the Easter vacation, and reappear\nonly on the days of the exams. If possible, bribe a friend to relay\na coo unt s of your continuous study back\nto college.\nb. Be seen studying furiously In- the\nlibrary all the time. This is more\neffort than 2a, but carries more con-vict ion. You need only be daydreaming over some journal, anyway.\no. Having carried out 1a, introduce\nyour speciality into the conversation\nat any opportunity in gre?t detail,\nremarking on its elementary character\nIf you have several specialities, the\neffect is more impressive: besides,\nthey may even come up ir. the exam.\nd. When actually in the examination\nroom:\n27 minutes after the start, go up to\nthe front and take, very deliberate^',\none by one, three supplementary answer\nbooks. Refill your pen once 48 minutes\nafter the start, and again 17 minutes\nbefore the end.\nAllow your desk to became cluttered\nwith all this (largely blank) paper,\nadding log-tables, blotter, hundreds of\ncoloured pencils, slide-rule, ink, etc.\nthus giving ah effect of furious energy\nand concentration.\nNever be seen to stop writing even\nfor an instant, even if you are forced\nto write sentences twice and cross them\nout again, or doodle on the blotter.\nJWalk out 2j minutes before the end,\nwith an absolutely deadpan expression on\nyour face, and slowly screwing the cap\non your steaming pen.\nD.E.H. Jones.\nSTROLLING ABSURDLY\nWhilst remaining ever impressed\nby the literary eloquence of the London\nTransport Country Walk series, I am\nalways left with the impression that a little more ingenuity oo ul d have been\nused in the description of the various\nitineraries. I therefore submitted\nthe following description of a genuine\nwalk route to the Editor, which he\nseems to have printed. Starting and\nending in Southfields, the journey\ncovers some of the most picturesque\nspots around the South West London\ndist riot. The route is presented in the form\nof a first-hand, eye-witness, on-the-spot, you-are-there account of the first\nannual Lsvenham Road walking champion-ships. The line-up at the start of\nthis year's race, which took place\nunder the steaming Temperate sun of\nSurrey and Middlesex, included only\none competitor, who was later to be\nproclaimed outright winner. This\nfearless entrant wore a sports cap\nsports oo at, and haversack; in his\nlefthand pocket was a carefully\nfolded butterfly net, whilst in his\nright hand pocket was his right\nhand!\nThe race began at 2.45 p.m. on\nWhit Saturday, the competitor setting\noff at a brisk pace in p lim so ll s, and\nwithout a map. Cutting across\nWimbledon Common, the Queensmere was\nsoon passed on the right, and the\ncompetitor restrained his impulses,\nknowing the his landlord had to swim\nthere every morning.\nNipping nimbly across the golf\ncourse to avoid being golfed upon\nthe head by a golf ball, he emerged\non to the' Kingston Vale opposite Robin\nHood Sate. Turning left, he proceeded\nup the A3, which leads to Portsmouth;\nhowever, it was decided that this might\nprove too far owing to the aforementioned Temperate heat of the day. And so\nhe strutted through the thick traffic\nof Kingston, avoiding being t raff ioa ted en rout*.\nLeaving the maddening crowds behind him he pointed his nose to the\nSouth for Hampton Wick, and the rest\nof his body followed amiably enough.\nCrossing the Thames, he arrived in Hampton Wick and carried straight on for\nHampton Court. Here he was faced with\nthe gates of Hampton Court on the left,\nind Bushy Park to the right. He turned\nright through the latter in order to\navoid the maze - you will recall that\nhe had no map and did not wish to get\ninvolved.\nThe trek through Bushy park led\npast the Horse Chestnuts in full bloom\nlike amiri ad of candle-bedecked\nChristmas trees twinkling with the\nlight of the Temperate sun, which by\nnow was losing some of its steamy heat\nand beginning to condense. The Moon\nwas just visible to the left or right\nof the Sun, depending upon which way -you stood, and it was observed that the\nformer was chipped where Jodrell Bank\nradio-telephone o all s had been bouncing\noff it. They have no respect for this\nthe earth's oldest satellite.\nTHROUGH SUBURB/A Emerging from Bushy Park, he\nturned left, still in the lead, and\nthen right through Teddington in the\nBorough of Twickenham - according to\nthe not ioe s to dogs on the lamp-posts.\ndogs o an' trawl r anyway. Crossing the\nThames again, bao k on the South Bank,\nhe turned left past the locks at\nTeddington, and began the long leg\nround the towpath of the Thames to\nRichmond. At 5.45 'The Three Pigeons'\nwas welcome ly sighted, nestling by the\nriver, with its beer garden commanding\na fine view of the reach to Teddington.\nArrived here, he produced the sandwiches\nand cakes from his haversack, both having been kindly supplied by his landlady.\nA couple of pints of Vr'at ney' s beer were\nrequired to lubricate all the s and which es eaten, the Cucumber ones being rejected\nowing to the contempt with which the ax\nstomach views simultaneous gifts of the\nlatter vegetable with alcohol.\nAt 6.45, he arose and took the 6.45\nexpress feet to Richmond, where he turned back up the hill, walking briskly to\navoid the famous Lass. A fine view\nback over the course is to be had from\nthis vantage point, with the river\nwinding into the distance, yet travelling all the time towards the ob-server.\nCrossing Riohmond Park, the\nskyscraper skyline of Roehampton\nsoon appeared, and was entered via\nRoehampton Gate. The later stages of\nthe race paa sed the 'King's Head' at\nRoahampton, the 'Green Man', Putney\nHeath, and 'Burghley Hall'. The race\nended at Lavenham Road at 8.30 p.m., after a total walking di at ance of\nabout 20 miles.\nThe author of the above account is not entering to defend his title next\nyear, having retired, not to write a book, but to draw up a map of the\nWimbledon, Hampton, Richmond district.\nAsked whether his ambition was to walk\nagain in any more of the season's big\nraces, the winner replied that his ambition was just simply to walk again -ever! As he spoke, the three men\nhired to pull off his p lim so ll s gave\nup the task as an impossibility. The\nwinner was therefore forced into the\nalternative of wearing this footwear\nuntil it dropped off through old\nx ge* \u2022 like a leaf from a tree in Autumn, although not, perhaps, 3uch an impressive spectacle.\n\n"

CRICKET Since the last report in Felix the\n1 st II have played six gem es, of which\ntwo have been I.C. victories ana! the\nremaining-four have been drawn. The\n.nT ml Whit-Monday trip to Hook resulted i a a good win for I.C. The, home\nside slumped from 121 for 5 to 134 all out (Beam 5 far 29: Clarke 4 for 12.)\nand I.C.h it off the runs for the\nloss of 7 wickets (Hoarn 65). There\nare two cricket teams which hove\nthe name \"Hook*, one in Hampshire and\nthe other in Surrey, but, despite the\nvaliant efforts of one member of \\3ie team, it has proved impossible to\nplay both sides on the same day.\nThe second. '. .Z. victory was\nagainst U.C. Hospital. In a very\nquick scoring game U.C.K. made 153\nfor 9 before declaring and I.C. scored 156 far 2 (Bartholomew 77:\nWhite 63 n.o.). The drawn games have usually been\nclosely contested: throe of them\nhave been played on Harlington wickets\nwhere it is a relatively easy matter\nto \"bat out time\". The game against\nWoolwich Poly, produced.some very slow\nsearing and it was not until the last\nten minutes of the game that runs came\nqui ok ly. Thanks to t ne 'Poly', convention of declaring at tea time we\nwere left with 135 minutes to score\n123 runs (Woolwich 122 for 8) but it was only with ten minutes left and 30\nruns needed that any real effort was\nna de to push the 3core along. This\ncan be attributed to a \"middle order\"\ncollapse,'for after an opening stand of\n53 we were 72 for 6. We finally\ntotalled 116 for 8.:(Bushby 37).\nAgainst South Row I.C. were bowled\nout, for the only time this season,\n- for 122 ( J. Webster '26 -n.o.), And in reply South Row. scored '110 for7( GalbaHy^3-far 21).\nThe last three games, two drawn\n(against S. Mersham and Charing Cross\nHospital) and the victory over U.C.H., have been notable for the ability of\nthe early order batsmen to score runs.\nWe totalled 175 for 7 against\n'Mershem, (Kapur 43: J. Vebster 55\nin. o.) who replied with 122 for 7, and\n209 far 3 against Charing Cross Hosp it al( White 77 n.0. Kapur 55 and Bartholomew 47)* Charing Cross replied\nwith 146 -far 3. This game was notable for the'fact that in the last\ntwenty minutes I.C. dropped six oat\u2022^hos. The bowler Who' suffered most\nto the extent of seeing five balls fly off the edge into the slips or to the\nWi cke t keeper only to be dropped, was\nBetteridge who finished with 3 for 23.\nAt this stage In the season it is possible to assess the strength of the\nside. One notable fact is that despite losses due to examinations and to\nin jus ios the l st XI seems to maintain\nIts standard; this is a tribute to. the strength of the 2nd XI. The first H bowling is good and since the \" tail\" does not start until number 10 the\njetting is also strong but the one large\naloud on the horizon fs the inability\nof the close fielders to hang on to\ncatches. This deficiency is the prime\nreason for the large number of drawn\ngames. There is one consolation for\nthis however and that is that each \"ch-ance\" of a. catch that is not taken\ncosts the offending player bd., and the\ndefinition of a\" oha no e\" is very liberal,\ncoat. o ol.2.
