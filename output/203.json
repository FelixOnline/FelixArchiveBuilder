And our graduate training scheme is\nplanned to be adaptable to his individual needs\n- to employ and extend his attainments to the\nfull.\nYou May Know Our Name But . . . just to\nremind you - we are not only the dominant\nasbestos group in Britain, we also have a large\nand growing stake in plastics, in insulation, in\nmineral wool, and in glass fibre . . . all adding\nup to a \u00a3100,000,000 business with some\n40,000 employees. Big enough to give a man\nscope. Yet, because each of our nine British\ncompanies largely runs its own affairs, not so\nbig that the essential 'human touch' is\nendangered.\nThis balance is reflected in our executive\ndevelopment training which, far from tying a man down to any one type of career \u2014\nproduction, sales, administration - allows him\ntime to discover his true potential.\nThis way, we invariably find that the graduate-assumes managerial responsibility more confidently - and certainly earlier - than is usual1 in a modern industrial complex.\nAsk your Appointments Board for further\ndetails, or write direct to:\nManagement Appointments Adviser, Turner &.\nNewall Ltd., 15 Curzon Street, London, W1.

Wells Society which is concerned with some less usual aspects of scientific knowledge is\nFlat Earth Society, which is devoted rather to preposterous\nscientific theories, or no \"Non-science \" as it has been described.\nThe title is not intended to indicate the beliefs of its members,\nbut rather the kind of belief it\nwishes to invest i a ate. The society\nis also interested in certain fantastic yet none the less genuine\nand not infrequent occurrences,\nsuch as the falling of stones and\nblocks of ice out of clear empty\nskies, and the spontaneous combustion of human beings.\nThe founders of the society,\nMike Harris and R. Graham\nBrown, claim that its purpose is\nprimarily entertainment though\ncombined to some extent with a desire to determine just what\nmakes an otherwise apparently\nintelligent man claim, for ex-ample, that he has found a cure\nfor cancer, but cannot reveal it\nas Confucious has appeared to\nhim and forbidden him to do so.\nThe sc;ie ty charges no membership fee, the small expenses\nbeing bourne by the founders,\nand attendance at the meetings\nhas (consequently ?) been large.\nSpeaking at the first meeting\nwere members of the Ancient\nOrder of Atlantians. These apparently fearful of a sub-standard\nlevel of credulity among the audi-en ce, toned down the content of\nthe talk to some platitudes concerning the amorality of the\nscientist, and the imminent self-destruction of the human race.\nMore interesting was the talk at\nthe second meeting given by the\nAetherius Society. This organisation was founded by a Dr.\nGeorge King who, in 1952, while\nsitting in his Maida Vale flat, was\ninstructed by a disembodied\nvoice to become \" the Voice of\nInterplanetary Parliament.\" Since\nthen Dr. King has had numerous\ntelepathic communications from\nthe \" Space People,\" which he repeats into a tape recorder when\nin a deep trance. In case anyone\ndoesn't know, the Space People\nare the highly advanced civilisations that live on the other\nplanets, and visit us frequently in\nflying saucers. It seems they are\ndispleased with the way we are\nrunning our planet, and are not\ngoing to permit us to land on the\nMoon or anywhere until we have\n\" put our house in order.\" The\nspeakers were well-spoken, apparently intelligent and knowledgeable young men, they were\nobviously convinced of the truth\nof their doctrines.\nH.

Debate, where it\nwelcomed the two visiting Americans with a Boomalacka. The\nmeeting continued one week later\nwith the Motion, \" This house believes that members of C.&G. Union should concern themselves\nmore with affairs of I.C. Union,\nthan with the activities of the\nC.&G. Union.\"\nThe motion was proposed by\nMike Combes, Editor-de-Luxe of\nFelix, who studied the Halls-I. CGuilds triangle. Don Leeper, for\nthe opposition, gave a brief account of the history and tradition\nof Guilds, and then pointed out\nthat the Halls could only cater\nfor a small percentage of the students at any given time.\nJohn Skinner, supporting the\nmotion, dealt with the status of\nGuilds, and I.C. in technical and\nbusiness circles. Finally Pete\nAirey urged the meeting not to\nleave a thriving Guilds Union, to\njoin a dying concern. Let the\nenthusiasm of Guilds keep I.C. running.\nThe motion was defeated by\n120 votes to 36, with 8 abstentions. DEBATING COMPETITION\nLast Tuesday saw the last\nphase of the Intercollegiate Debating Competition, with Guilds\nproposing that they would rather\nbe Bonds (James) than Beatles\n(The). The Berry-Schroter-Hall\ntrio debated well, pointing out\nthat they would rather be a virile,\nactive two-legged Bond than a mopped mobbed eight-le geed Beatle. R.C.S. spoke also.

    "content": "FELIX5 COICUTT\nTHE SATURDAY NIGHT\nHOPS\nI happened to be around last\nSaturday at one of the weekly\nhops held in the Union. The\ngatherings, which are not unlike\na disorganised cattle market on\nsome occasions, fulfill a very important function in allowing college clubs to swell their coffers by\norganising a hop. I wonder if\nthe people who come along are\nalso filled with a sense of pur-pose. On last Saturday, several\ninteresting types were on view.\nThere was the long standing lad,\n25 years old or so, who has been\nhere for five years. He is a big\ndrinker, but as safe as an eunuch.\nThen, there was the would be\nsmoothie, very provincial in his\nfancy coat with the red velvet\ncollar. He fancies himself, but\nusually walks home alone making a lot of noise. Some of the\ninnocent ones, who still believe\nthey can find true love at a hop,\nwere successful, but only a few.\nThen there was the cynical onlooker with other means of access\nto women. He seems to like pretending he is a psychologist. Still,\nwhat matter the players, the\ncoffers of I.C. are filled.\nSOUTHSIDE\nThere has been considerable\nwriting on the problem of Southside these days, of which a not\ninconsiderable part has been\nbased on misconceived ideas. It\nis noticeable that the penthouse\ndwellers have acquired one or\ntwo high riding and low thinking\nfollowers. Everybody realises\nthat from now on an ever increasing amount of student activity\nwill centre around the halls of\nresidence and the Union hierarchy aim to assure that complete control of all student acti\"vities remains within the student\nbody. The indirect and subtle\nmeans adopted by the penthouse\ndwellers are not obvious to the\naverage Union member, in fact it\nis amazing how few people\nseem to realise what is going on\nWake up, Southside, before you\nfind yourself in the same situation as U.L. U. COMMENT\n\"I am not an irresponsible\nperson, like some around here, I do not drink beer and I am never\nseen drunk. Indeed, no ! I drink\nwine at refined parties and stagger home in the early morning.\n\" People consider me the\nlesser of two evils, so they will\nelect me,\" said Mr. Berry, shortly\nbefore his election as President of\nIan Campbell had nothing but praise for I.C. Folk Song Club\nand admiration for the club's\" regulars\" appearing on the same\nbill on 10th March. He added that many London folk clubs had\nfew professional performers as good as I.C.'s offering.\nIt was unfortunate that this Hootenanny failed to get off to a good start, mainly due to unfamiliarity in the use of microphones.\nThe evening did not in fact really kick off until nearly nine o 'clock\nwith the appearance of Derek Hall, an artiste of many facets and\nsupreme confidence. This was timely for the Ian Campbell Group\nwas scheduled to follow.\n\" JUG O' PUNCH \"\nIn view of the shabby treatment they had received at a number of recent college appearances,\nthe Campbells arrived at I.C. with some trepidation. But they\nwere soon made to feel as at\nhome here as at their own \"Jug\no' Punch \" in Birmingham.\nOf radio and tv fame, the guest\nstars came to I.C. after as tre nou o us afternoon recording ses-sion. For this reason they had\nasked to be limited to one hour's performance. However, as a result of the tumultuous welcome\nthat they received, they performed for at least half as long\nagain, regrettably halted only by\nthe clock and the Duty Officer.\nConnoiseurs appreciated this to\nbe one of their best-ever per-form ances, with less informative\nchit-chat and more songs (in clu d ing a number of requests).\nCLIMAX OF THE YEAR The audience of 160 heard\nmore music made by Rod. and\nAlex, Elvina, Sam Apeji, Colin\nand Judy, the Wayfarers, the\nBlues Group, and Kate and Roy.\nBill Clifton, the world-famous\n\" Bluegnus \" authority, had been\nexpected to drop in during the\nevening. We must now wait until\nnext term for him to promote\n\" Talking Beatles Blues \" (\u2014and\nBluegrass) at IC Folk Club.\nD.I. W. PBDBLEM\nGiven angles ABC\nAGS = 80 , SBC = 50^\nand DCB = 6 0 \u00b0 , find by geometry value of angle EDC.\nU.L. U. It seems he was right,\ngood luck to him. Now he will\nbe too busy to worry about I.C. Those amazing sex letters were\nso obviously written by people\nvery lacking in experience and\njudgement. What were they but\nsermons by outraged churchmen\nand invitations to free love from\npeople who are sorry they do not\nhave a nasty disease. Nobody\nspoke a sensible word on behalf\nof the majority of normal people\nat the college. However it was\nvery interesting to notice that our\nenraged churchmen seem to know\nmore than they should about the\nphysical side of sex. It seems the\nsight of a woman's leg above the\nknee sends them into a frenzy.\nJ.

But since as\nfar as the academic year is con-cern ed, we're now well round the\nbend for better or for worse, I'm going to have a fling. As is well\nknown, I 've got a narrow confined outlook on life, so, with\napologies, what I have to say may\nhave some connection with the\nUnion.\nMOVING IN\nNumber one priority this year\nhas been moving into South Side\n\u2014the bottom floors, that is. Ii or one find the building extremely\npleasant, particularly the interior.\n(The President and Secretary of\ntwo years ago\u2014Lyle and Stacey\u2014\ndeserve great credit for their choice\nof furnishings.) However, it certainly caused some headaches.\nThe biggest surprise, I think, was\nto find that the main heating pipes\nfor the building ran through the\ncellar of the bar\u2014cost to put\nright, \u00a3800. Again, the messengers\ncounter is just far enough from\nthe cloakroom to make it impossible for one set of men to do\nboth jobs, so either we loose\ncoats or furniture, or pay a second\nfortune\u2014the building is a security\nnightmare from start to finish with\nmore than twenty separate en-trances. However, given a few\nmore paintings and a loudspeaker\nsystem for telephone messages\netc., (both of which are in the\npipeline) the place will be just\nlike home.\nREFECTORIES\nOpening South Side caused near\nchaos for Mooney (remember\nthose queues ?) and a thumping\nloss was run up in the first few\nmonths\u2014we're still waiting to see\nwho is going to pay. Everything\nhad to be worked out again just\nabout from square one\u2014working\ntimes, staffing, costing. Incidentally, the relevant committee here\nconsists mainly of students, so\ndon't take it all out on our beloved catering manager. Believe\nme, his lot is not easy\u2014he gets\nhammered almost daily for one\nthing or another, and rarely a helpful or thankful word. (Next\ntime you're organising a meeting\ntimed to finish at 6.30 why not let\nhim know?)\nThe basic reason for rather\npoor service and high prices is\neconomic\u2014the refectories have to\nbe designed and staffed to meet a peak aem and which lasts for\nabout 30 minutes \u00a3o \u00bb about 30\nweeks of the year. Mooney makes\nthe best of this with a skill which\nat times verges on i he criminal!\nRUNNING OUT\nThe Union's financial resources have become more and more\nstrained with continued inflation\nsince our last increase in 1957.\nSo far it has been possible to\nshield club activity from this only\nby holding back expenditure in\nother directions such as refurnishing or filling the obvious need for\nextra secretarial assistance, for\nexample. It seems, for a number\nof reasons, that we have reached\nthe limit of this process, and if\nwe don't have more money by\nnext year even the clubs will begin\nto feel the pinch. Negotiations\non this have been underway with\nthe Governing Body since last\nsummer in an attempt to provide\nboth short and long term solutions\u2014so let's keep our fingers\ncrossed.\nFEUDMANSHIP\nSo much rubbish has been\nspewed forth in print on the subject of a reported Halls/Union\nrow, that one hesitates to dive into\nthe refuse. However, the bubble\nought to be pricked; if it wasn't for being reminded about this\nrow in each edition of \" Felix \" I wouldn't know it existed. Cameron said much the same thing in\nthis newspaper last term.\nUnlike Messrs. Williams and\nCollins, I can't speak for \" The\nUnion,\" and unlike Mike Combes\nI'm not prescient, but certain\nthings seem self-evident:\n(1) What the residents of any hall\ndo with their own time, energy\nand money is their own affair,\nand if the Union starts meddling in these matters it will\nrightly be told where it gets\noff.\n(2) Likewise, vice versa.\n(3) If a hall wants anything from\nthe Union, it will (and does)\nask for it.\n(4) Likewise, vice versa.\nSo good luck to the hall footballers, cricketers, folk-singers and\nwhat have you. Williams, Combes,\nCollins, Annard et all should\neither find a more profitable way\nof idling their time away, or a different hobby horse to ride\u2014\ntry \" Personal feud between Watson and Massey \" for a change.\nUNION MEETING\nTomorrow's(i.e. Thursday's) Union Meeting is the penultimate\nhurdle for the modest changes to\nthe Bye-laws which Council recommended on an honest attempt\nto oil a few joints. Watch out for\nthe people who will say \" We\ncould do it this way or we could\ndo it that way, but we shouldn't do it as suggested.\" What they\nmean (but can't say) is that they\ndon't like the idea of a general\nmeeting electing a DeDutv PresiArTTHue AMD MIS BOOZ ieS A \u00ab BEATS Dr. We ale reports on A Above the inconsequential i ties and trans cie nt sensations which\ndistract Union meetings, and sell\nFelix, there persist some fundamental and enduring topics such\nas the quality of the beer at\nHarlington. By coincidence this\nessential fluid is supplied by the\nsame firm which contributed substantially to the cost of extending the pavilion bar two years\nago. To verify that this charitable\norganisation is maintaining responsible standards of production\nthe Griffin Brewery on the Cromwell Road extension was recently\nvisited by the honorary inspecting\ncommittee for wines, ales and\nspirits at Harlington (HICWASH).\nAlthough greeted deferentially by\nCol. Fuller in person the dedicated inspectorate allowed themselves to be detained for less than\n\u2022 an hour-by his preliminary hospitality, and were then guided\nthrough the production processes\nby two of the military malt ster' s affable aides. Hops, wort yeast,\nmash and the ladies of the bottling\nsection, were all critically ap-praised.\nHICWASH was concerned to\nlearn of the obstructionist tactics\nof Customs and Excise, who\nmeasure vat levels to within 0.1\ninches, but was impressed by the\nmajestic stillness of the vast tanks\nin the fermentation room. Here\nthe coloured glass windows,\n(dating from its former use as a Church Hall) create a suitably\nreverent atmosphere. It was unfortunate that Inspector Cunningham should stagger drunkenly on\nthis tranquil scene, but he had\ncracked his head pa a copper\npipe in an excess of inquisition al of Gravity\nzeal. As a final duty HICWASH\nassembled in a room curiously\ntermed the \" Cage \" to examine\nsamples of Vecent brews. The\nOld Burton in particular (3/- per\npint) was generally approved, and\nInspector Havard arranged for a small barrel to be supplied (at\ncost) for his next important rugby\nfixture. After conferring again\nbriefly on the merits of the latest\nbrewing of \" London Pride \" the\ncommittee assented to a suggestion that they might care to have\nlunch before leaving ; but to show\nthat this would in no way influence their final report, took tins\nof beer away for iur the r analysis\non their return to College.\nIhe Athletic Ground Committee has since decided to continue\ntrie exclusive sale of Messrs.\nFuller's beers at Harlington, i or the time being.

    "content": "Egotistical Bombast - p.4U.L. U. PRESIDENT\nTO SERVE I.G. WARNING!\nTHIEVES PROSPER AT I.C. The number of incidents of thieving at I.C has now risen to a very sinister and ugly all-time high. Nearly every day something is\nreported missing and, in the vast majority of cases, there is no doubt\nat all that thieves have been at work.\nWe seem to have passed beyond the stage of cushions and cutlery\nbeing stolen from the Union ; such outbreaks of childishness are,\nregrettably, to be expected of a rather immature mentality in every\nsociety. What is quite inexcusable, however, is the blatant stealing\nof money from people's jacket pockets. This would seem to represent a hideous sickness which must be stamped out for the good of\nthe community.\nWALLETS VANISH It is a frightful criticism of our\ncollege that nobody can even\nhave money in their jackets in the\nbilliard room : wallets have just\nvanished in the dim light. Money\nmust be carefully guarded in the\ngym, for people have crept up the\nback stairs, and disappeared\nagain without a sound. Jackets\ncannot even be left for five\nminutes on the tenth floor of the\nphysics building : again a wallet\nhas been stolen.\nThere is nothing casual in the\nnature of this kind of stealing,\nneither can it be attributed to an\noutsider: the outbreaks are too\nnumerous, and the places so un-likely.\nAlso, some of the incidents\nseem to have a particular element\nof nastiness. On March 4th the\nFelix collecting tin in the Mech.\nEng. building was emptied between 5.30 and 8 o 'clock in the\nevening. The amount of money\nmissing, as yet undetermined,\nprobably represents the difference\nbetween profit and loss on that\nissue. It would be a sad reflection on the college if a number\nof people had to miss lectures\nsimply to guard these tins. An other revolting crime reported to\nMr. Jock Henry, the chief security officer, was the removal of\na cello from an obscure little\ncloakroom in the Union. Is anything safe ?\nMr. Henry also stresses that the\nsecurity guards have an impossible job on their hands. They\ncannot eject outsiders from the\nUnion, because students will not\ncarry their Union cards, and even\nif they could, students would still\nbe leaving their jackets around,\nalbeit in apparently safe places.\nThe answer lies with the stu-dents. If you take your jackets\noff at any time, remove all money\nand put it in your trouser pockets.\nThis applies to everyone, and to\nevery conceivable part of the col-leg e. Remember, you can trust\nno one.\nWill anyone who has\ncome to be in possession of\na metal plaque inscribed\n\" UNIVERSITY OF LONDON AIR SQUADRON\"\nplease deliver it to the\nUnion Office so that it can\nbe returned (without any\nquestions being asked!) to\nthe owners.\nSMALL ADS.

Frank Fuchs outlined his desire to\nsee UL U as the mouthpiece of its 25,000 students\u2014and as taking a leading role in national student affairs. Tony Berry threw\nout ideas on student services, festivals, overseas students, 6th form\nconference, and advance planning for UL U in the event of the University of London being split into several smaller Universities.\nSARCASTIC\nThese speeches contrasted well\nwith President Anderson-Evans\nreport a sarcastic and fist clenching little speech admitting failure\nto run the Kennedy Memorial\nFund, in chucking carnival out of\nUL U and failure to run an Education Year March (remember\nthe anti a per the id March).

    "content": "FELIX3 dear sir... SUPPLEMENT GEER?\nDear Mr. Michael Combes\neditor sir.\nSo I read your last editorial,\nand I immediately thought SEX\n(I have to say this in order to get\nthis letter printed). And I should\nlike to raise a jew points. First\npoint; origin of GROT.\nThe word GROT was used as\nfar back as 1902, by D.H. Lawrence, in his writings on the British Public, and following the death\nof his Mother, it can therefore be\nclassed as a D.H.L. Four-LetterWord. In modern usage it can\nbe used as an adjective . . .\ne.g.\" Grotty advertising \" or as\na noun\ne.g.\" A pile of Grot\" or as an\nadverb.\ne.g.\" The meeting was handled\nGrotily \" or as a verb\ne.g.\" He was Grotted on the\nhead,\" or as an expletive\ne.g. \"Grot you\\ I\" or conversely\ne.g. \"Grotl Grot\\ Grot\\\"\nWot a lot of gro t we got . . .\nAnd Grotty Advertising . . .\nSince I arrived at the College in\nthe dark ages of the Waterhouse\nBuilding, the standard of advertising has increased greatly. This\nyear, the best advertising has been\ndone by the Folk Song Group,\nI.C. Dramatic Society (And last\nyear!), Wells Soc, The Carnivals,\nFelix (even) and the S. S. Stomp,\nfor comprehensive coverage.\n(Please Mr. Combes, check your\nfacts before printing Felix, the\nstickers that you refer to in your\neditorial were nothing to do with\nthe S.S.S., they were advertising\nthe U.L. Ally Pally Stomp). With\nincreasing advertising, comes increasing need for display areas,\nthere are still places in the college\nwhich are inadequately supplied\nwith student advertising areas.\nPlaces such as Huxley, Elec. Eng,\nRod. Hill, and Physics., and\ntherefore organisers of functions\nmust resort to unorthodox sites\nfor their adverts, in order to\nget a good display area. Good\nadvertising is an Artform, and in\na college of Technology such as\nl.C, Artform should be enc our aged. In the Socio-economic\nstate in which we live, advertising\nplays a great role. Good advertising within the college should be\nencouraged, wherever it is positioned. Even Felix has found\nthe need to resort to Grotty\nAdvertising . . . sticking notices to\nwooden stools, tables, black-boards, even on gro tty black tins\nplaced in the centre of walking\nareas. Excellent advertising for\nFelix . . . But let others be excellent as well.\nYogily yours,\nD. G. BISHOP\nED.: Bully for Yog! But the\nGrotty Advertising (meaning un-sight ly) congregates in areas well\nendowed with display space, viz.\nUnion entrance and South Side all\nover.\nACTIVITY\nDear Sir,\nThings have been happening in\nTizard Hall on a scale and in a direction impossible to obtain\nthrough the constituent unions.\nI am referring to the visits paid to\nTizard Hall by several important\nmen in various fields, not necessarily scientific. The non-scientific men are, in my opinion of\ngreat importance, as students can\nonly come in contact with them in\na non-academic, informal atmosphere in the Halls of residence.\nOur union societies are in no way\nbrought into competition with the\nhalls in this field, as they just\nhaven't the same facilities. People who think that the Hall residents should not make the best\nuse of their opportunities, arguing\nthat these are detracting from\nUnion functions, at tei u len ces, must fail to see the point. This is\nsimply that there is a large psychological gap between strolling\ndown to the gallery floor to meet\nsomebody important, and going to\nattend a society lecture in the col-leg e. Its also a matter of convenience for the student, like\nswitching on the television to see\na film, against going round to the\ncinema. By bringing the activities\ninto the Halls, people who cannot\nafford to make an evening of it,\nmanage to spare the hour or two\ninvolved by attending small, informal meetings in Hall.\nI remain Sir, un brainwashed, M.H. SOMMER,\nTizard Hall.\nAPOLOGY\nDear Sir,\nWe wish to tender our apologies for our very personal and\ntome what rude comments concerning the girls of Physics II,\nwhich appeared in the last edition\nof \"Felix.\"\nYours sincerely,\nThe Long and the Short\nand the Tall.\nPoor Taste\nDear Sir,\nI was amazed at the poor taste\nshown by the writer of the second\nJuke Box Jury Sketch at last\nweek's Smoking Concert. I refer,\nto the carrying of Buddy Holly's\" coffin \" across the stage as a\" personal appearance.\" Most\nof the audience seemed to think\nthis highly funny, but it and the\nbeer marred for me an otherwise\nreasonably enjoyable evening.\nYours sincerely,\nR.S. ROBERTSHAW\n(Phys. 3)\nDear Sir,\nIt is disappointing that not one\nof your very critical correspondents in the issue of 19 February\neven makes reference to the excellent Electrical Engineering\nSupplement in the previous issue.\nThis venture is, to my (perhaps\nbiased?) mind, only one outward\nsign from the most forward looking and progressive Department in\nthe College.\nBut, why should electrical be\nthe only Department in the College to believe that the professional engineer of tomorrow will\nhave to solve human problems at\nleast as taxing as the technical\nones? I feel that engineering\nstudents find humanities harder\nthan substituting figures into\nformulae, which is why some\nstudents do not \" . . . seem yet to\nbe wholly \" with us \" in some of\nthese experiments . . . \" (Sir\nWillis Jackson). On this basis, the\nmost important parts of a degree\ncourse at C and G are the fundamentals of engineering and hu-mani ties. The most essential\nfeature of university teaching is\nthen avoiding\" spoon-feeding;\"\nthe easiest way to spoon-feed \" a student is to make him copy formulae from a blackboard for three\nyears.\nYours faithfully,\nJ. LEWIS\n(2E) DELINQUENCY\nDear Sir,\nI should appreciate it if you\nwould permit me a little of your\nvaluable space to express a sentiment of my own.\nI am not a fudd y dud dy or a spoil-sport or anything of the sort,\nand I admire healthily executed\nrags or pranks or stunts.\nI have watched males de bagged and females made to stand on\ntheir heads without batting an eye,\nbut u when it comes to deliberate\ndestruction by violent means of\nCollege fittings and furnishings, I draw the line.\nIn a word that is stretching it\ntoo far. During the ULU Rag\nWeek, no less than four of the\nsubstantial metal handles, such as\nthose found on the refectories,\nupper lounge and bar exit, were\nwrenched off, not to mention\nlock's and lamps destroyed.\nI do not think for one moment\nthat these acts were perpetrated by\nI.C. men, but I fail to see how\nthey could have been done without being observed by some I.C. when all good I.C. men should\ncome to the aid.\nI think such acts are pointless\nand puerile and should like to see\nmore of the \" Mens sana in cor-pore sano.\"\nThanking you sir, I am\nYours,\nJ. STANLEY BRANKER\n(STAN)\nDear Sir,\nIn the past Felix has been\nknown for its bad spelling and\ngrammar. I am happy to say that\nthis has improved greatly in recent\nweeks. However, the extraordinary lapse of Felix No. 202\nforces me, much against my will,\nto complain. I refer of course,\nto the headline \"It's Gear \" to\nthe article about the Hyde Park\nRoad Relay. This sort of thing\ncan be tolerated no more. Anyone\nwho has ever lived within 20 miles\nof Lime Street will know that the\nexpression should be \"It's the\ngear \" and I hope that points like\nthis will be checked in future.\nIncidentally, it is my theory that\nthe word should be spelt \" geer,\"\nbut not everybody would agree\nwith this.\nR.A. WAFER (Maths I)P.S. Would anyone interested in\nforming a\" Geer Society \" please\ncontact me.\nCRUDITY\nDear Sir,\nAt the risk of turning Felix into\na journal of sexual obsession, I would like to add a few comments\nto the \" great sex battle.\"\nI think that most reasonable\nChristians expected that the letters\nfrom the \"angry virgins\" would\nprecipitate the storm of protest\nthat followed. To dogma tis e to\na readership which essentially\ndoes not accept the basic premises\nof Christianity, is bound to meet\nwith ridicule. After all, we are\noften rightfully described as being\na post-Christian country.\nHowever, dogmatism apart,\nthere is some cause for com-plaint. Perhaps the two offending items in Felix came in for\nharsher treatment than they de-served; but I feel that a much\nwider view is that many I.C. productions regularly overstep the\nboundaries of common good taste\n(Is good taste a Christian con-ce pt?) To mention a few which\nusually offend\u2014The smoking con-cert, the festival of music and cul-ture, and of course Stynx. Subtle suggestive humour can be\nhilariously funny to an adult\naudience, and at the same time\nquite harmless. Crudity seems to\nbe the I.C. equivalent*. I.C. scriptwriters seem to have misplaced the concept that humour\nis intended to cause laughter, and\nan enticement to vomit is often\nsubstituted.\nCould it be that one of the\nunderlying motives for the\nbumper Christian lobby was an\nearly attempt to save Felix from\njoining the crude clan?\nYours sincerely,\nMIKE HOSKER\nED.: We're willing to be saved,\nbut perhaps a more subtle approach\n\n"

Within a few hours of the\ndismissal from Beit it was \" common knowledge \" that the miscreant\nhad \" simply kept a male friend on in his room for a couple of hours\nafter the Liston-Clay fight.\" Naturally, from this arose fears that\nhostel regulations were about to be tightened up, that this poor innocent was just a scape-goat in the cause of showing that the wardens\nmeant business. Dave Watson's statement that the whole situation\nwas much too delicate to be manhandled by the Felix Staff did little\nto help eliminate the disquiet. The \" scape-goat\" himself, Mr. J.D. Nisbett, seemed to think differently, saying the decision was quite\njust, particularly as it was the second time he had been guilty of\nthis mis demean our! NO ALTERNATIVE\nOf the disciplinary sub-com-mitte e of residents, three were in\nfavour of expulsion, the other\nthree thought that, under the\ncircumstances, some lesser punishment might be more reason-able.

No-one recognised\nthem. 10.15 sc rut in ee ring successful,10.30 timed laps for grid\nposition\u2014car 6 finished in the\nfront row but No. 5 was some way\ndown due to ignition trouble.\n12.00 \u2014 They're off \u2014 car 6\nstreaks into a twenty yard lead\nafter one lap.\u2014Nigel Wood not\nstudying the Bristol talent for a spare minute or two.\nThe start was a fantastic sight,\n46 cars of all sorts and sizes surging all over the track : crunches\ngalore, but great fun.\nFASTEST IN THE FIELD\nIt was soon obvious that we\nhad the fastest cars but we hadn't bargained for the number of\ncrashes that this would involve us\nin. Spokes were ripped out at an\nalarming rate and Jim Andrew\nwas soon at work doing a tremendous job. in repairing them.\nBy 4.00 p.m. everything and\neveryone had settled down, so we\nlivened it up. Ken Oldfield broke\nthe lap record by 13 seconds,\nbringing it to 59.8 seconds. We\ncelebrated with our 2nd or 3rd Boomalaka of the day.\nTHE NIGHT CLIMB\nThe night arrived, we all got\nvery cold, but our cars\u2014\" the\nred devils\" the crowd had nicknamed them\u2014kept going lapping\nevery other car. Unfortunately,\nthe wheel trouble and an unfavourable handicap were great\ndisadvantages. At midnight we\nwere positioned 16th and 17th. Slowly we climbed through the\nfield ; by 9.00 a.m., none of us\nhaving had more than two hours\nsleep, we were 9th and 10th, and\nat the finish 5th and 6th. Just\nbefore this. John Gent and Nick\nWalker both completed 200 laps\n\u2014nearly 40 miles.\nThis was a great weekend. The\nspirit, the atmosphere and the\npeople made it like the real le\nMans. You can be sure that\nGuilds will enter next year and,\nwith a bit more luck, win.\nI would like to thank, in par-ti cula r, Alan Oxley, Mike Leppard, Jim Andrew, Mike Hutton\nand Sid Cawson for appearing in\nthe workshop at 9.00 a.m. for five\nweeks, Cyril King for letting us\nuse his work ship, and all the\nother peddlers and supporters\nwho made this venture so worth-while.\nNICK WALKER.

    "content": "FELIX7 BOAT CLUB\n1-2-3\nIt was an unprecedented one-two-three victory for the Boat\nClub in the University of London\nhead of the river race. The 1st VIII won the Dixon Bowl, the 3rd VIII were second and the 2nd VIII were third. In addition the\n5th VIII won the Dixon Cup for\nthe fastest novice crew, their\noverall position being fifteenth.\nStarting into a strong head-wind, ten seconds or so apart, the\ncrews had to face rough water\nfor the most of the course. The\n1st VIII rowed well at 35 as far\nas Hammersmith, where they\nwere only 1\u00a3 lengths behind the\nU.L.2 nd VIII, the crew that had\nstarted first. By Chiswick steps,\nhowever, the I.C. crew was flag-g ing, and were further upset by a heavy wash. This enabled the\nuniversity crew to get away again\nand by Chiswick Bridge, the\nfinish, they were well clear.\nSoccer: UL. Cup\nBOXING\nATHAR EXCELS\nHaving been soundly beaten by\nU.L. a few weeks previously,\nGuys Hospital came in for\nanother hiding on February 28th, this time at the hands of I.C. Middle Weight\nM. Neville-Polley (I.C.) was\nmainly on the retreat but beat\nB. Hartley with occasional attacking moves.\nLight-Middleweight\nIn a bout marred by the lack of\nfitness of both competitors, M. Philpott (I.C.) beat R. Knight on\npoints. Philpott appeared to\nhave a good right hand but was\nunable to floor his opponent.\nLight Weight\nBoth N. Athar (I.C.) and D. Edgar showed considerable skill\nand made this the best bout of\nthe evening. Athar eventually\nbeat his opponent on points.\nWelter Weight\nG. Thomas was the only I.C. man to lose his bout. He was up\nagainst a much more experienced\nboxer in D. Gibbs but fought very\nmuch better than in the previous\nmatch.\nQMC 2; ICOh!\nA collection of talented individuals failed to hold a hard-work-ing, well drilled team on the cold, windswept wastes of Motspur Park\nand so the U.L. Challenge Cup goes to Mile End Road for the first\ntime ever after spending the past five years here in South Kensington.\nI.C., with their seven University players, never really got into\ntheir stride until the end of the\nsecond half when it was all over.\nIt seems that three cup matches\nhave not been sufficient to produce a team understanding between these men who do not\nusually play together.\nThe game began with the usual\nprobing and summing up between\nthe teams and twenty minutes\npassed without a shot leashed in\nanger, but with Q.M. C. getting\nnoticeably more of the play.\nThen in a sudden reverse I.C. were on the attack. A Crawford\nlob into the penalty area was\nhastily pushed back by a defender to Winder, in the Q.M. C. goal as Vaughan came charging\nin down the middle.\nFREE KICK\nTwo minutes later a Crawford\nfree kick from twenty yards out\nwent wide, then another Crawford lob found Winder covering\nwell with Vaughan again coming\nin fast. Finally a lovely cross\nfrom Cox on the left wing found\nVaughan's head but the ball went\njust inches the wrong side of the\nupright.\nCROSS COUNTRY\nWELSH WANDERINGS,ETC\nAt this time of the season it is\nalways difficult to turn out a full-strength team; what with injuries\nand the usual end of term chaos.\nThus on leap year day a small\nteam travelled over to Cardiff to\nrun in a new fixture against the\nUniversity, but even with the\nencouragement of the captain's girl-friend could do no better\nthan 2nd. This just about made us\nquits, having beaten them in the\nHyde Park.\nFollowing a cold, wet and very\nmuddy excursion up to Barnet,\nwhere we beat Guy's but not\nBart's, came the Reading to\nMitcham Relay. This is a40 mile,\n8-man road relay run, usually\ndisaster ou sly, by King's. This\nyears race\u2014run into the teeth of\na sub-zero gale\u2014was no ex c ep tion: owing to a mix-up on the\nlast leg, (the blame and consequences of which nobody cou'd agree on) the team race had to be\ndeclared void. Unofficially tho vr rh we came 8th \u2014just behind Cardiff.\nAfter that, play returned to the\nI.C. half and soon, on the half\nhour, Q.M. C. were a goal up. In\ngram had come out to the edge of\nthe penalty area to collect a stray\nQ.M. C. pass but was beaten to\nthe ball and could only watch as\nit was crossed to the goal mouth and forced in by Howorth past a perplexed I.C. defence.\nQ.M. C. should have made it\ntwo when, minutes later, Ingram\ncould only parry a fierce shot but\nthe rebound was blasted inches\nwide.\nH.T. Q. M.C.1I. C.0 Mary's started pressing again\nstraight from the re-start proving\nthat any superiority I.C. may\nhave shown in the closing minutes\nof the first half was not to last.\nNine minutes later they were\nawarded a free kick on the edge\nof the penalty area\u2014a short cross\ninto the middle and Howorth\nheaded first time into the net for\nhis second goal.\nI.C. could well have scored\nwhen Huxtable sprinted in to\nturn a Stoddard corner kick towards that vulnerable spot at the\nbottom corner of the net, and\nagain when Casemore shot hard\nfrom ten yards, but Winder was\nequal to the occasion each time.\nSCRAMBLE\nIn fact, the only time he came\nnear to being beaten was in the\n73rd minute when a beautiful\ncross from Huxtable was played\nback on to the goal line by a Q.M. C. defender and in the ensuing mad scramble the ball appeared to cross the line several\ntimes. The whistle had already\ngone for an I.C. foul, however.\nWith only 10 minutes left on\nthe clock I.C. at last began to\nlook desperate, but this did\nnothing to improve their coordination and Q.M. C. free-wheeled\nhappily to the final whistle and\nvictory.\nSPORT SHORTS\nWATER POLO\nI.C. have won the UX.U. Water Polo League and never before has the standard of play\nbeen so high in the college. Roy\nClark has played splendidly in\nattack and goalkeeper John Banyard has been the mainstay of the\ndefence.\nJUDO\nThe Judo Club added another\nvictory to their impressive record\nthis season when the Ist team\nwent to Cambridge and defeated\nthe University by 2\u20141^, thus\ncompleting the double over this\nvery strong side who had previously beaten Oxford 6\u20141.\nBASKET BALL L.S.E. beat I.C. by 54-66 in the\nfinal of the U.L. U. Cup. I.C. found themselves up against a well-drilled man-to-man defence\nand never really got the better of\nit. They suffered a severe setback in the second half when Bill\nSteiger had to retire with a badly\ndamaged ankle.\nSOCCER\nLast issue's feature on Colin\nCasemore stated that he had won\nBristol University Caps. This\nshould, of course, have read\nBritish University Caps.\nCRICKET\nTrials take place on the Monday before the start of next term,\nand the following Wednesday.\nPlease try to attend one of these\nij you would like to play for the\ncollege,\nATHLETICS\nAt this time of year ! The first\nmatch ended in the narrowest of\nvictories for I.C. over U.C. with\nQ. M.C.a rather trailing third.\nBOAT CLUB\nThe 1st VIIIfinished7th in the\nKingston head of the river, Kingston Rowing Club winning the\nevent. The third eight won the\npennant for the fastest junior\ncrew.\nSAILING\nFor the first time in three years\nthe College lost the Castaways\nCup, the team being exactly the\nsame as that which won on the\nprevious occasions. Strong winds\nand a temporary loss of form\nwere responsible for the upset\n\n"
