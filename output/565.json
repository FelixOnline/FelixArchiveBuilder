The conditions\nmade good passing difficult and it was\nobvious that the team that made the least\nm'. takes would win. After ten minutes, Andy\nHartland pounced on a through ball to make\nit 1-0. This proved to be the decider.\nIC continued to play good football for the\nremainder of the first half with Elliot, Smith\nand Dean combining well on the left. During\nthe second half, defender Mulhall was very\nlucky not to be sent off for heading a boot and\nthen laughing at the referee. IC defended for\nmost of the second half, but had one or two\nchances, the best falling to Bateman, who hit\nthe post. However, UC lacked penetration up\nfront and Orgasmitrov did not need to make\none difficult save.\nTEAM: Organoffski, Reeve, Smith, Mulhall,\nWard, Elliot, Nicchols, Bateman, Saunders,\nHartland, Dean.\nFootball Seconds\nA TREMENDOUS second half performance\nenabled the seconds to overhaul a two goal\ndeficit and leave the UC ground with a well\nearned point.\nEarly on misfortune beset IC when Lakin\npulled a hamstring and hobbled off to view\nthe match from the sidelines. Before the\ndefence had reorganised, UC were a goal up\nand minutes later an unfortunate penalty was\nconceded and converted to make it 0-2.\nAfter the break however IC battled back\nbravely with Veenman and Armstrong leading\nmany forceful forward runs. A cross from\nCarr was converted by Merritt, after which a UC attacker beat a slowly advancing IC\ndefence to make it 3-1.\nFurther misfortune struck IC when Clarke\nleft the field, although the whole team\ncontinued to fight and soon cut the deficit to\n3-2 after a well taken goal by Veenman. Soon\nafter a fierce near post shot made it 4-2 to UC.\nMore good midfield work enabled Esberger\nto shoot from a narrow angle to reduce the\ndeficit to 4-3. With only five minutes from the\nfinal whistle, a well struck shot by Merritt\nsqueezed under the keeper to square the\nmatch up at 4-4.\nTEAM: Veats, Curran, Beer, Armstrong,\nLakin, Griffiths, Merritt, Clarke, Veenman,\nCarr, Esberger.\n|\nH Compiled by\nPhil Webb,\n0Sports Editor\nFootball Sixths\nIC VI cruised to their third victory in three\nmatches against St Georges Hospital to give\nthem a maximum of six points out of six.\nIC dominated the game from the start and\nthroughout the first half launched a series of\nmenacing attacks on St Georges goal.\nGartside, Milner, Gannaway and Roache all\ncame very close but the easiest chance fell to\nJohn Chamberlain who fired Steve Davies's cross wide from three yards. At half-time the\nscore was nil-nil.\nDuring the interval, IC were given some\nvery large orange segments and consequently\ncreated numerous chances. Following a melee in the penalty area, the ball broke loose\nand Mike Roache slotted the ball in from the\nedge of the area. The Hariington Academicals\nsoon went two up when Gannaway's cross,\nfollowing a fine run from Davies, found Mike\nRoache running in on the blind side of the\ndefence to score. IC kept up the press ue, and\nthe defence (Higham, Davies, Bradley and\nNagle) coped admirably *'ith any breakaway s. The Sixths scored their third goal when John\nChamberlain j inked past two defenders only\nto be brought down in the penalty area.\nGartside broke the British land speed record\nas he thumped the penalty in the left-hand\ncorner.\nTEAM: Hampton, Higham, Bradley, Nagle,\nDavies, Milner, Tinkler, Gartside, Gannaway,\nRoache, Chamberlain.\nThis space could have\nbeen used for a sports\nphotograph if anybody\nhad taken any.\nAlternatively, it\ncould have been used\nfor a cricket report,\nhad it not been submitted on Wednesday\nafternoon.\nRCS Hockey\nA SMALL brave band of RCS hockey players\n(ten in number) took on the massed ranks of\nmedics from UCH (eleven players), and drew!\nBiting tackles from a newly-formed side,\ngradually getting over its teething problems,\nmade the UCH defence open wide. UCH\nextracted a goal with clinical precision after a few an aes the ti sing tackles by the RCS defence. RCS probed and bored into the\ncavities at the back, and, using all the gaps\ngot a firm hold on the game with the forwards\nscraping past grinding tackles, the midfield\ngobbling up every ball within spit tng distance\nand all defence feeding the RCS probes.\nAfter more than one short corner, Scrope\ndrilled the ball into the throat of the goal to\nearn RCS a worthwhile draw.\nWe at \u2022\n> definitely going to win next week. (I SUDDOSI this match and article gave you\nsome FULFILMENT, eh Robyn? - Ed.)\nWater Polo\nON Monday, October 17, the Water Polo Club\nplayed Neptune as one of the final matches in\nthe Middlesex League.\nApart \u00bbrom Dave Roberts, our Captain, who\nwas absent due to bowel trouble, there was a very good turnout for the occasion.\nThe ma1, ch was very easy as the result\nshows, notable performances from fresher s Phil Mills and Nick Buckland who each\nscored, and Nick Last who managed to put\nthe ball in the back of the net five times.\nThe final score was 11-1, a comfortable win\nwhich should ensure a place in the third\ndivision of the league next year.\nThe next match is away, against Isleworth\non Friday, October 31.\nTEAM: Ribar, Porter, Tayler, Smith,\nAshwin, Rackingham, Hay, Mills, Buckland,\nHeffernan.\nResults and Reports\nfor Saturday, October 25\nSaturday, October 25\nRUGBY1 st XV V Royal Holloway2862 nd XV V Royal Holloway330 FOOTBALL1 st XIV BYE\n2 nd XIV BYE\n3 rd XIV UC II 2-2\n4th XIV QM C446 th XIV St Marys Coll51 RS MV UCH35 HOCKEY1 st XIV Mead hurst413 rd XIV Silverwing40 Rugby Firsts\nA changed side from Wednesday's413 romp\nlooked and smelt a little bit the worse for\nwear, due to an over alcoholic Friday night.\nHolloway came close to looking as pretty\nas we did in their green and black hooped\nshirts, but it was soon evident that IC were the\nsuperior team.

By half-time we had scored two good\nforward tries to lead 11-6.\nThe second half was broken up by a visiting\nambulance which removed an injured\nHolloway player. However, even with a replacement, they were unable to halt the fire\nrolling mauls of the IC pack which lead to a further three tries leaving the final score at\n28-6.

    "content": "Dear Sir\nI hope that not too many students were taken in by Sir Keith Joseph's rather simplistic ideas last Thursday. While I would agree that competition is\nvaluable, Ido not agree with Sir Keith that competition between a lew large companies is the same as competition between a large number of small businesses. Anti monopoly laws have not been very effective in the past, yet the Conservative Government of which Sir Keith is a member does not seem to be putting much emphasis on tightening the m,oron breaking down the existing private monopolies. Nor does it\nseem to be putting much priority on profit sharing; it seems content that workers do not get\nany direct benefit from being competitive, and thus do not have any incentive. The fact is that monopolies can exist under private ownership, and competition can exist under public ownership. The debate between public and private ownership is largely irrelevant to Britain' s future. Conservative polities are actually squeezing out small businesses, thus destroying competition. This is not surprising when one notes the large financial contributions given by big business to the Conservative party. Sir Keith criticises the power of politicians while accepting the need for some government control, ye the does not seem to be interested in even the most basic reforms to make government more democratic. Sir Keith' s inhumanity was shown when he suggested that people should accept lower wages to get jobs, mentioning particularly those areas covered by wages councils. These are among the lowest paid jobs in the country \u2014 less than \u00a3 5 0 for a full working week being not uncommon. He mentioned hairdressers where the minimum wage is sel\nat \u00a3 3 6 a week. I wonder if Sir Keith could live on this amount. Has he ever considered that there are vacancies in these areas because people just cannot keep their la mi lies on these wages.' Surely il should be the higher paid who take the cuts to enable these workers to be paid a de tent wage. Sir Keith Joseph's policies are like all Conservative policies; designed to ensure that real power and ownership lies in the hands of a small and privileged elite, while most people arc condemned to spend their lives as slaves in an in human system over which they have little control.} ours\nMatthew Hunt bach Computing3 Dear Steve\nI would like to make a lew things a little clearer for Fiona Sinclair after her attack onIC WAin last week's FELIX. I object to her statement that\" Sandra O' Sullivan was the only member of the committee who had any contact with or cared about, the women at College\". I myself, and the rest of the committee have a great deal of contact with the women at College and spend many hours discussing their views with them whether they support I CW A or not. When Sandra was in office the committee asked her to use her ideas and concern for women in College to help the rest of us to make I CW A into the type of association she feels is needed. She declined, leaving all of us wondering exactly how much she does care. I wonder if Fiona was a tour first social event, the Fresher s' Plough man's Tea, at least one hundred people attended this\nevent and enjoyed it.\nI would like to point out that although for us quorum is 2 0 % ,\nfor UG Ms it is 6 . 6 % . Since, unlike Sandra, Iam not in Maths3, I maybe mistaken, but I have worked out that6.6% is considerably less than20%, not more as Fiona suggests. In view of this\nwe feel that a lower quorum would still be representative. I realise the new I CW A Lounge is not luxurious, but I wouldn't call it a ghetto. Women do not lock themselves in there every lunchtime, this would be against fire regulations anyway. As for throwing away \u00a3 5 0 0 ( re: John Passmore) this money s to provide social events for370 women for a whole year. Finally, anyone is welcome to offer constructive critics m about I CW A. but Fiona seems to have a purely destructive attitude. I suggest Fiona either tries to use\nher energies constructively or leases those of us who are interested to do this instead. Yours since) Iv\nSheila Cox\nGeoJ 2\nDear Steve\nI was mildly surprised to read the sonam bulat ions of Miss Fiona Sinclair in last week's FELIX. In her letter,s he states that a quorum of20% is low; if so then that of a nICU GM(6,66%) is\nabyssal. I CW A is not a committee so Miss Sinclair's comparison is\ninvalid. I CW A needs100 people to attend its meetings for them to proceed; on aL In ion Committee of under thirty there obviously needs to be more than six people present. In addition, a committee member is usually highly motivated, where asIC WA members run the gamut of inspiration. The accusation that the present I CW A Executive will not change is easily refuted since they cannot do so till a meeting is\nquo rate. I would suggest that Miss Sinclair raises her army of alienated women and attend the next I CW A meeting and initiate change. It ill befits Miss Sinclair to point the icy linger of disdain. The policy of glorious inn action which she so applauds in Mis sO' Sul ivan will only lessen the pressure for change. Yours sincerely\nStephen Gould er Dear Steve\nRe:R aeS nee's letter in FELIX563. At no time last year was I informed of either: a) House Committee's decision to convert the TV Room into a committee room; orb) Joint House Committee's decision to give I CW A use of the room. They did not even have the courtesy to tell me that these topics were on the agenda of the meetings, otherwise I would have objected very strongly indeed at the time. For along time now, the TV room has been the meeting place lor Snooker Club. Since before1972, the Club has been clam me ring for a third table. The main arguments used by Union hacks against a third table:1) No room available.2) One table was used for an elite few.3) Too expensive. Well,1) The TV Room was the best\npossible place to put another table, and Malcolm Brain knew damn well we wanted that room.2) A valid point, which I corrected during my year as President.3) For a Union that can afford to spend umpteen thousand pounds on a1916 fire engine, or can afford to lose \u00a3 5 0 0 on a concert, surely they should be able to afford a snooker table that would last at least 7 5 years! I was given a distinct impression last year that the club would, probably begetting a table this year. Some facts:\n1) Snooker Club is the biggest recreational club in College, yet it spent the least amount ol money from RC C. Its membership has increased60% since1977 and by about400% since1967.( It\nnow has about275 members a year.) How doI know all this?\nSimple, the Club has record sol minutes as early as1959.2) According to the Blue Book(1978), the Chairman of the House Committee is the Deputy President( i. e.,Ra eS nee). This being the case, why did she not in form the Club of the Joint House Committee's decision about the TV Room. Conclusions: Rae S nee and her bosom friends, or House Committee want to get rid of I CW A, so they put them in a room where they will cause the most uproar, and hope that Snooker Club will instigate a constitutional motion to dissolve I CW A, as some attempted last year. I, personally, do not believe that I CW A should exist. But, Ido believe that students elected to represent and govern other students should be dependable, and Rae S nee does convey tome that impression. During my year as President of Snooker Club, I learnt how various committee members made sure that their interests were upheld, and anybody else s could goto hell(e. g.,R CS,C& G.R SM always got what they want at a UFC meeting, and another e.g. is S nee's personal vendetta against I CW A being fobbed oil on to Snooker Club via House Commit te). You don't have to believe me, but why don't you just popover to the next UFC major claims meeting and see for yourself. What/ saw was a bunch ol about ten sell centred hacks handling roughly \u00a3 1 2 , 0 0 0 of your money, and making sure that it went to\" worthwhile\" causes. I have rambled on a bit too long. I apologise; but those tw at s continued on page 4\nPage 2 FELIX, October 31, 1980\n\n"

    "content": "Knowles went close with a header, which\nrocketed inches over the bar. IC failed to\nconvert many chances, but the defence did\nwell to soak up some intense UC pressure to\ngive IC a10 lead at half-time.\nThe second half started well for IC when\nFlanagan scored with a brilliant header from a cross by Hawa. UC pulled a goal back when\nthey scored from a controversial penalty\nwhich was awarded after an incident which\nleft Wiggins on the ground and the UC player\nstill standing. Immediately afterwards,\nRedmayne was injured but, courageously,\ndecided to play on with a badly twisted ankle.\nDespite these setbacks, IC continued to play\nsome good football with many attacks\ncoming via Rimmer, who played an excellent\ngame at right-wing. The third goal was scored\nby Hawa who collected an overhead kick\nfrom Flanagan and slotted it neatly past the\nkeeper. Flanagan completed his hat-trick\nwhen he nipped in on a sloppy back-pass to\ngive IC an emphatic 4-1 victory.\nTEAM: Johnston, Dunhill, Knowles,\nFledmayne, Drabble, Audin, Sims, Wiggins,\nRimmer, Flanagan, Hawa.\nFootball Fifths\nFOLLOWING their excellent 5-1 win over UC\nIV on Wednesday the fifths produced another\nscintillating performance to bundle QMC out\nof the cup.\nWith defence looking as solid as ever the\nfifths took advantage of their complete\ndominance to miss a multitude of chances.\nAfter several easier efforts had been missed\nLay stepped up to stroke a through ball from\nMorris past a helpless keeper. The second\ngoal followed soon after and was yet another\nDhillon free-kick special.\nThe fifths took a30 lead when Hardy took\nthe ball straight from the kick-off ghosted\npast four QMC defenders and chipped the\nball over a bemused keeper. The fifths\ncontinued to dominate the second half and\nwere unlucky not to score when first Kelly\nheaded against a post and then Cable\nwatched a superb shot brilliantly saved by the\nkeeper. The fourth goal came midway\nthrough the second half when Audin\noverlapped down the right wing and crossed\nfor Healy to slot home.\nIn the dying minutes a suspiciously off-side\nQMC attacker headed a consolation goal.\nThis game represented yet another fine win\nand also the final game of Denis Cooke for\nICAFC. Denis has proved over the years to be\na fine and valuable servant of IC Football\nalways reliable and prepared to turn out for\nany team. If advancing years have started to\ntake the edge of his pace his experience and\ncoolness in crisis have still been invaluable.\nMany thanks to our Denis.\nTEAM: Brown, Audin, Cooke, Cable, Lay,\nKelly, Morris, Dhillon, Baldwin, Healy, Hardy.\nMO Match D Cooke\nFootball Sixths\nA HAT TRICK from Mike Roache helped the\ngiant-killing IC Sixths to comfortably over\ncome St Mary's Hospital 5-1 in the preliminary\nround of the cup.\nThe Sixths started the game at a very fast\npace which the St Mary's defence were\nunable to cope with. The Hariington\nAcademicals went ahead when Davies\nsprinted down the left and sent over an inch\nperfect cross for Roache to head in. More\ngoals followed when Chamberlain received\nthe ball on the left, slammed the ball in the\ncorner of the net. A few minutes later John\nscored an almost identical goal to put the\nSixths three up. The fourth goal was not long\nin coming; Tinkler put the ball through and\nRoache scored.\nThe second half started more evenly but\nsoon IC began to apply the pressure using\nthe speed and close control of Davis and\nChamberlain to get behind the St Mary's defence, which was forced to defend in\nnumbers allowing Gartside, Milner, Davies,\nClegg and even, in some cases, Nagle and\nBradly, to support the attack. IC created\nnumerous chances; Milner and Davis both hit\nthe bar and countless times the St Mary's goalkeeper made acrobatic saves when a goal looked certain.\nSurprisingly, St Mary's scored the next goal\nfrom a cleverly judged chip from the edge of\nthe penalty area.\nIC were soon back on the attack; Milner\nsplit on the defence with a through ball that\nRoache thumped in the back of the net (for\nhis hat-trick) to give IC Sixths an emphatic\nvictory that belies their presence in such a low division.\nTEAM: Hampton, Clegg, Nagle, Bradley,\nDavies, Milner, Tinkler, Gartside, Davis,\nRoache and Chamberlain.\nHockey Firsts\nLAST SATURDAY saw the IC 1st XI venture\naway from Hariington for the first time, to\nplay Meadhurst, the BP Research Station\nteam. On a reasonable pitch IC moved swiftly\ninto attack, and after a few minutes Lito Rich\n(Mining 3), scored underneath the goal-keeper's feet. Meadhurst made a rapid reply,\nlargely due to the Captain's and goalkeeper's error. IC were soon back in the lead following\na bullet shot from a penalty corner by Ian\nCrowe (Mining 3). A subtle alternative penalty\ncorner produced the third goal when Steve\nGatley (Mining 3) scored a goal off the inside\nof a post. Shawn Bell scored a fourth goal just\nbefore half-time.\nThe second half was goalless, a rFd somewhat less exciting, although this was\nprobably the best performance by Mining\n3/lm peri al College so far this season.\nTEAM: Jones, Barns, Crowe, Riley, Davey,\nHughes, Ayres, Clarke, Rich, Bell and Gatley.\nHockey Thirds\nBRITISH AIRWAYS crashed in an untidy\ngame after starting the game with only eight\nplayers. Two goals down after five minutes\nBA were strengthened by the arrival of a ninth\nplayer and the acquisition of Martin Taylor\nfrom the IC team, who proceeded to be an\nembarrassment by being one of their better\nplayers. The match continued with BA having\nlittle idea and our forwards soon tired of\ndominating the game and started a competition to see who could squander the most\nscoring opportunities.\nStarting the second half three up. IC\ndecided that any further effort would lead to\nBA being whitewashed. BA disturbed our\n'keeper' twice whilst IC kept up the pretence\nof playing stylish hockey. At 4-0 the final\nwhistle went and we all adjourned to the\nchanging rooms to sample Dave Cornwall's jug (bought for scoring all four goals).\nTEAM: Hutchings, Sawers Rampton,\nPurdy, Webb, Clift, Subbiah, Witter, Cornwell,\nWylie, Taylor, Mitchell (Capt).\nThe man in the iron mask\nSnooker\nThis year'sB team, looking remarkably like\nlast year'sC team, suffered an unprecedented\ndefeat at hands of LSE B team. It was only\ndue to the unexpected good performances of\nS Bennett (Trainer-Manager) and G Machin\nwhich save our pride. The other three idiots in\nthe side managed to lose convincingly.\nHowever, the B team Captain, S Bennett, has\npromised the general public that he will\nknock the team into shape by next Wednesday.\nThe A team won 4-1 against QMC A team,\nand the C team won 5-0 against Bedford\nCollege.\nLessons are being given every Monday\nevening at 5:30m, so anyone who feels in\nneed of tuition is welcome.\nCross Country\nJUST a brief set of notes on the season so far;\nthe UL trials were held on the 4th, attended\nfrom IC by Tim Hayward and Mark Thwaites\nwho both ran well for such an early stage of the\nseason. The first friendly of the season was\nheld on the 8th over a not very well marked\ncourse, where again Mark Thwaites ran well as\ndid Chris Smith.\nThe UC relay at Parliament Hill, a6 x2 mile\nrelay, on the 18tn went reasonably well with a team of Kelly, Kirk, Longhurst, Hayward,\nRussel and Burke, finishing 5th this being a good result for a weakened team.\nThe first London College's league race, also\nat Parliament Hill was held on the 22nd; it was\nvery nice to have a turnout of ten, which gave\nthe second team four runners and thanks must\ngo to everyone who came. The first team ran\nsurprisingly well and solidly with Steve Kirk\nfinishing well in seventh place, Chris Smith\nrunning well in 30th, Garry Longhurst also\ndoing well in 33rd and f Mark Thwaites\nrecovering from an injury in 39th. Finally mention must be made, albeit\nbelatedly, of one of the greatest feats of\nathletic is m by anyone from IC. Mark Pritchard\nin running 150 miles in twenty-four hours is\nnow in the top twenty of all time for this event.\nRSM Football\nTHIS GAME kicked off early which seemed to\nthrow the team into some confusion resulting\nin some very fluent and entertaining football;\nUCH scored when Newman just failed to\nreach the ball as it passed under him! RSM\nfought back with consistent pressure,\nresulting in a move down the right where a clever back-heel set up put Blain to score his\nfirst goal of the season.\nThe match stayed evenly poised up to just\nbefore half-time, when Newman mishandled\na cross from the left which allowed UCH to\nknock the ball into the empty net.\nAfter the interval, Mr X slotted the ball\nfirmly into the corner of the net to equalise. A defensive error allowed UCH to take the lead\nagain, but not to be outdone RSM equalise d through Hanker.\nWith fifteen minutes to go fitness began to\ntell and UCH scored twice. Overall it was a good team performance which should have\nbeen better rewarded.\nTEAM: Newman, Everett, King, Blain,\nSaunby, Aplin, Pio, Mr X \u201e Hanker (Capt).\nAN Other\nIC RUGBY\nWednesday, November 5\nGUTTERIDGE CUP\nIC v Kings College Hospital\nat Hariington\nAll supporters welcome.\nNOTE:\nArticles are included in these pages\nonly if the editor can read them\n(note: Hockey and Table Tennis\nClubs).\nFELIX, October 31, 1980\nPage 11\n\n"

    "content": "The Counselling Service\nby Don Adlington, Student Counsellor\nIn a FELIX article at the end of April I tried to outline some of the misconceptions/ prejudices commonly held about counsellors, since it seems likely that some people at least are deterred from making contact with me for those sorts of reasons. I'm keenly aware of certain hazards inherent in writing about counselling \u2014 for one thing it's terribly easy to sound pretentious.\nI'm paid by the College to\nrun a service which is essentially intangible \u2014 I don't teach, type, cook, administer, or research anything. The core of my work quite simply is talking to students for whom things have gone wrong, and because life for\nstudents, as for everyone else,\nis essentially rather messy\nand complex, there is seldom any sort of scientifically verifiable end result or product( though I believe that much is often achieved).\nMe It seemed to me however that there might be some merit, especially from the point of view of newcomers to the College, in describing the sort of problems or difficulties that students actually do bring to my office.\nFirst of all there are people with straightforward' welfare' type queries with clearly identifiable boundaries. For example an overseas postgraduate may wish to discuss the implications of bringing his wife and children to\nthe United Kingdom, or how to\nget his children into primary school, or how to make use of the\nNational Health Service. Similarly students in financial difficulties or with unusual accommodation anxieties often find it helpful to\ndiscuss these things in a neutral setting before making major decisions, or before talking to other people on the College stall\nwhose job it is to help in a more direct way. I suppose that about a third of the students I see are in this loosely defined' welfare' category. Most of a student counsellor's work however is concerned with problems of a different order. I call them personal' problems for\nconvenience \u2014 their common characteristic being that they give rise to distress or anxiety of a more or less disabling kind. In these circumstances students are not seeking advice or information, nor usually are they expecting an easy ' solution'. They may have come to feel, often rather hesitantly, that they must talk to someone, for no better reason than that some sort of immediate relief is\nevident simply from having talked \u2014 of having given expression to\ntheir lee ling s, and knowing that al\nleast one other person understands. The great majority of these kinds of problems fall fairly readily into one of three categories and I will discuss them in turn:( a) Work/Motivation Problems\nA student may come to talk to me because he feels, rightly or wrongly, that his work is not satisfactory. He may indeed have failed an examination, or achieved a result that is markedly worse that he had expected. He may have lost interest in his subject \u2014\nat least temporarily. He maybe straightforwardly shocked at the\nintensity and high level of the course he' s following and be suffering a para lys in gloss of\nconfidence as a consequence. He may already have had a less than happy interview with his tutor, senior tutor or supervisor. In these\ncircumstances I always try to clarify two things \u2014 first of all what is the objective reality of the\nstudent's report of his work performance? And secondly, is the student's motivation good? It is\nimportant to ask the first question because one occasionally meets both undergraduate and postgraduate students who believe that their work is poor, and feel\nunhappy about it, but who are in\nactuality working a la perfectly satisfactory and sometimes a very high level. Clearly the reasons for\nsuch apparently inappropriate anxiety ought to be explored \u2014\nbut the problem is essentially different from that of a student lacking motivation. Iam quite sure that each year the college admits a number of students who have made an error of choice either of subject or of university, and a smaller number who would have been better advised, irrespective of A level results, not to have gone to university at all. The remedy in these cases may well be to consider some radical rearrangement, and other things being equal, the earlier the better.\nFor the postgraduate and especially the research student work difficulty can be particularly distressing since it almost always follows a good experience of first\ndegree work, and there is an in built assumption that qualities which made lor success at one level will be the same as those\nrequired at another. The research student who is anxious about his\nwork sometimes feels much more isolated with his problem than his\nundergraduate colleague, especially if lor one reason or another his\nrelationship with his supervisor is\na nun supportive one.( b) Relationship Problems\nIt is not unusual to talk to students who are not working effect iv ely, but where there is a very high level of motivation( or indeed who may be working efficiently, but bele eling miserable nevertheless) and it is necessary therefore to look at\nsome other reasons why things are going wrong. The characteristic which marks off university students from the rest of their peer group is that of\nintellectual attainment, and if a balanced and happy life was linked in some associative way with that single factor there would be little need for student counsellors. Personal development however is far more complex than that, and it is a striking fact that a person's social and emotional development for example maybe markedly out of line with that of\nhis intellect. This multidimensional view of personal development and the observation that we may progress along different dimensions at varying rates, is widely accepted, and it is as true of the non student as of the student. It is a source of special difficulty for students however for a number of reasons, one of them being that most people entering university are leaving home for the first time to do so. In effect it is often the first time that people are thrown on to their own resources for social contact and emotional support, and a person who is relatively inept at making this adjustment, but who has survived perfectly well in the assured security of the family, may quite suddenly and unexpectedly find himself feeling isolated, lonely and depressed. It is a personal observation, though one shared by many academic colleagues that Imperial College is not an ideal set ing in which to overcome these sorts of difficulty, and it may be. important for students to be aware that sympathetic help is easily available and that there is much to be said for talking to someone sooner rather than later if one's initial experience of university life proves to be something of a disaster.\n(c) Grief Or Loss Experience\nStudents are of course as vulnerable to the contingent hazards of life as\nanyone else. The shattering impact of bereavement is well understood, and the necessity of relieving students of their academic obligations at such times is widely accepted. Perhaps it is not quite so generally accepted that a broken love affair is just as much a grief experience, and is always a serious matter for the university student, who will almost always find his ability to work badly disrupted lora period of time. Similarly students maybe seriously distressed,( and academically disabled) by disharmony in their parents' marriage, and a widely held assumption that it is only the young children in a family who are affected is simply not borne out by experience. All these events share the common psychological thread of a fracture or threat to the emotional dependency links on which the sense of wellbeing of every human being rests.\nThe student counselling service is confidential and independent of other services in the College. My office is at 15 Princes Gardens, and I can be contacted on Internal4205. Don Attlington\nFELIX, October 31, 1980 Page 9\n\n"

    "content": "Old Preversions\nUG MI don't want to steal Steve' s thunder, but I was extremely pleased with the turnout and the way in\nwhich we managed to get through the agenda. It is\nthe first UG MI remember which actually closed and was not adjourned or deemed' in quo rate'. I hope they continue in the same mode. Robert Pryor House\nAfter some investigation, it would appear that\nCollege bought the lease to this house in Easter1979 knowing that it would have to be renovated. However, they did not have the money at the time.\nSo it stayed empty for a while, was temporarily occupied and is now to be renovated by Easter1981. How College have managed to keep the house empty for more or less two years knowing that the renovations had to be carried out is\nbeyond me. Two years rent has been lost, so when it does open, rents will probably reflect this.\nNice one College! Third World Scholarship\nJohn Smith has agreed to the idea of using a covenant scheme among staff to raise money and suggested that it be done as part of the Queens gate Trust. This seems to bean excellent\nidea; I hope that it results in much more money for the TW S and WU S. Anyone who was at the U GM will have heard Jane Goldsmith from WUSs peak. If anyone is\ninterested informing a Third World Group to help with WU S and issues relating to the Third World could they please contact me in the Union C if ice. SU Financing\nHaving spoken to both John Smith and the Rector, I have been assured that they known o more than I do.I treat the DES with some suspicion as the information received so far is not\nat all optimistic. We must wait for the final plans\nbefore we can react, but we must not be complacent. ULU Constitution\nThe Draft UL U Constitution will be circulated next week, for discussion in College unions. If we\nare to amend it then we must meet and make proposals to Council on November10. There will be a meeting on Tuesday, November9 at 1 : 0 0 pm in the S CR Union Building. John Passmore\nMatters Raised\nJust a short article this week, as last week was spent mostly in committees, more committees, Com mem Day, and even more committees. Bookshop\nThis is just to remind you that the Imperial\nCollege Bookshop on the walkway is YOUR Bookshop, run for you, and also the profits go back to your through the Union. The shop should have all your recommended textbooks, as well as a comprehensive stock of stationary, files, pens and, of course, Union regalia. And remember, if\nyou' ve any suggestions or complaints, please\ncome and tell us and we'll do our best to do something about it.\nJudo Mats\nAt present we have a couple of dozen old judo mats, which have been lying in the corridor of the Gym for about a year. If any club, society or individual has a use for any of these, I'd be very glad it you' d come and take them away( after\nwarning me first!), otherwise I shall dispose of\nthem elsewhere PS\nThanks to Liz, and all who helped make Com mem Ball the great occasion that it was. Cheers Rae Lizzie's Wee Bit\nIn the last two issues of FELIX my allocation of\nspace has been tied up with the list of successful parking permit applications. Should these permits remain in the Union Office after 5 : 3 0 pm on Friday, October31, I will reallocate them to people whose need appears to be greater.\nLast Thursday the Commemoration Ball was held and from the comments I received everyone thoroughly enjoyed the occasion. My thanks to the Dance Band, Jamie for his disco, all the wine\nwaiters, the cloakroom attendants and those\nheros who set up the J CR for me. My one problem was that some miserable blank pinched the parachute after the Ball had finished. However, it turned up in Southside strewn over some poor gentleman' scar who then handed it to Frank Potter, Warden of Keo gh Hall. Don't panic, Dram soc.... it will be returned! Last Tuesday several people turned up to help\ncollate 2,000 copies of Exec News. My thanks to them but to the rest of Council who didn't make any effort Iam not very impressed. I hope that the\nadditional copies of Exec News and the posters designed by Dave Wheatley do the trick and we actually manage to have a quorum present at the U GM. If we don' tI'm at at loss as to where we go next. The invitations to IN COST were sent out at the:\nend of the summer vacation to fifty-five?\nestablishments in Europe. far we' ve had eight\nreplies with a total of twenty delegates hoping to attend. The deadline for replies was set at\nOctober31,1980, but we intend to allow a few\ndays grace and then send out reminders. If this\nfails the Union has no alternative to cancel the conference which will be a shame considering the\ntime and effort put in by a large group of people. At the moment I'm keeping my fingers crossed! Brain has now gone dead so this will have to suffice for this week. Liz\nThe Phoenix\nTHE PHOENIX is the magazine of Imperial College Union. It is directly descended from The Science Schools Journal, whose founder, HG Wells wrote in his first editorial of December1886: \"Here, from north, south, east, and west,\nare gathered minds specially capable oj\nacquiring, retaining, and displaying systematic\nknowledge. Clearness of perception, imagination,\nand order are alike the mental requirements of\nthe scientist and the writer. We may, therefore,\nreasonably expect that our pages will be filled\nwith right opinion well expressed\".\nHis magazine bears little resemblance to the Phoenix of today, but the suitability of our students as contributors is ever undiminished. The magazine has a different role to fulfil now that\nnews is delegated to Felix, coarser humour to the Rag Mag and College block contributions to ICON. The Phoenix will not report ort it i late, but\nwill attempt to provoke thought on a grander scale.\nTo paraphrase our first editor, you are here\nbecause your ability to observe, analyse and record is considered far higher than that of the average man.So, your observations on College life, London life, indeed on life in general, whether in words or pictures, will be most welcome for this year's edition of the Phoenix. Please submit all offerings before the end of term to: The Editor, The Phoenix, c/o Felix Office. The next meeting of people interested in promoting and/ or producing The Phoenix will\nbe on Monday, November3 in the lounge above Stan's Bar at 7 : 0 0 pm. You are welcome to come along and see what' s happening, or even join in! Clubs & Societies\nWUS\nIMPERIAL College has a very good record in\ncampaign' ng for WU S; \u00a3 7 0 0 has already been raised this year for the fund to support a refugee\nstudent from the Third World to study at Imperial\nCollege. There are several refugee students from Ethiopia.? id Chile already studying at Imperial on WUSs ciJa r ships. WU S diu ct s funds where the need is greatest\n\u2014 there at a over400 refugee WU S award holders in Britain and WU S supports educational projects throughout the Third World through its\ninternational organisation. The watchword is reconstruction; African students supported by WU S from Uganda and Zimbabwe have already completed their courses in Britain and are returning to their own countries to devote the it skills to Third World development. WU S is a charity with a record of sixty years dedication to helping refugees. It's been estimated that at anyone time there are ten million refugees\nin the world, soW US relies on the continued support of the students' unions like ICU to keep up the good work. Keep the contributions rolling in \u2014 Don't let\nWU S turn into WAS! Jane Goldsmith\nField Officer for World University Service20 Compton Terrace, N l2UN Concrete Canoes\nFOUR years ago the Ci vEng dept was confronted with this statement:\" The CANOEs hall be constructed entirely in concrete or mortar reinforced with steel or fibre\". Much laughter followed until the more learned of the gathering remarked that they had heard of concrete vessels( in fact, someone had made a4 mm thick concrete diving board, but that's another story). So, this wasn't another Mines joke. From the non civil engineers became a rare breed. Following the trails of unfinished problem sheets and empty cement bags they were found working hard in the concrete lab. The n,one day, from the dust a grey object appeared, the problem of the concrete canoe had been solved and these engineers were seen around College once again. When the first ever British concrete canoe race was over, Imperial emerged overwhelming victors. The following year was asad disaster, but\nthe latest weekend of battle was very promising; for just two weeks' work by one person the construction prize came to Imperial.\nThis brings us up to date. June 2 0 and21,1981, is the date set for the fourth concrete canoe race, and this year with the help of more beer we shall\nnot only retain the construction prize, but win all the others as well.\nLiberal Club\nAre you bored with Conservative Society dragging down members of Parliament to apologise for the actions of the Government in\n. boosting unemployment, bankrupting industry and slashing social services. Well, there is a choice, because Richard Wainwright, Liberal MP for Colne Valley will bespeaking at College on Thursday, November6. At12:45 pm PROMPT, in\nMe chEng640. Richard is the Liberal economic and treasury spokesman, and has been busy attacking the Government policy on high interest\nrates, and slashing aid to industry, so he'll have a lot to say. He'll bespeaking on the real alternative\nto a. harsh Tory government, and a Labour party split between left and right, liberalism. Come along and get a different view of things \u2014 see you there.

    "content": "Access\nCards\nNEW SECURITY arrangements for College buildings mean that the doors will be locked after10 pm. Me chEng, Mines, Physics( including Huxley) andEl ecE ng have had key card access points installed; these are likely to be brought into operation around November10, although it is\nexpected that Ele c Eng will be operational at a later date. The other College buildings will be shut after10 pm. Key cards are allocated to departments according to how many the Head of Department requires. If any PG thinks they will be inconvenienced without a card, they should see the Head of Department. ALL buildings are going to have designated exits after6 pm and College Security urge all members of IC to respect this. They add that should you choose to leave via an on designated exit, could you \u2022 make sure to lock the door behind you. IF Triumph\nTHE FIRST MATCH of the City and Guilds darts championship produced a shock result on Tuesday night. A confident Me chEng I team arrived at the LT n st it ut Francais Union Office( minus Chr as, one of theMe chEng Soc Reps). Both captains agreed that the rules should be modified to make it more interesting. A game of eights at1001 straight in was agreed. Finishing on a double or nearest the bull if the match had n't been won after eight players from a team had attempted the finishing double. The men from Me chEng I had to play left handed. The girls from IF averaged30 with each set of three darts and after some erratic play from the men( The IF mascot, Andre, had a few painful experiences) IF found themselves stuck on double three. Tension mounted as each girl went for' nearest the bull'.A brilliant throw from Nicky Burrell gave the game to IF by a quarter on an inch. IF will play the winners of Ci vEng II vs. Me chEng PG s in the next round. Motor Show W As might have been expected, the Motor Show this year was\ndominated by one car, the Leyland Metro. As we arrived at\nthe show, right outside the main entrance was parked an\ninnocuous looking police car, which just happened to be a Metro. Parked in the entrance hall, in the Lloyds Bank of all\nplaces, was another Metro.\nIt was not, however, the first actual show car that you came across.\nThis honour belong d to the new Ford Escort, the introduction of which\nmay have been overshadowed by the Metro, but whose excellence I very\nmuch doubt will be. Ford have again managed to produce a neat, modern\nlooking car that is obviously not just are styling of an existing model, like\nthe Morris Ital/Marina.\nThe other notable stands at the show all belong to British\nmanufacturers. The Rolls Royce stand as ever attracted large crowds.\nThey had two new cars on show, but impressive as they were, they just\nlooked like any othe Rolls Royce to me. By far the most impressive stand\nbelonged to Aston Martin. In their large stand area, which was covered in\nthick pile carpet, stood just three cars, all oozing class \u2014 the gull-wing\ndoo red Bulldog, the Lagonda, and the Volante. The only other stand to\nattract more crowds was, inevitably, the Leyland stand, and the Metro.\nAll credit to Leyland, they certainly weren't underselling their car.\nFilmshows, models, dramatic music and commentary \u2014 it got th e lot. I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised by the car. It definitely\nappeared more stylish in real life than it had in the photos I had seen\nbefore, and inside the car, although being quite plain, it was every bit as\nroomy as Leyland claim.\nAll in all, it was a very impressive Motor Show. The Birmingham\nExhibition Centre is obviously much more capable of holding the show\nthan Earls Court. The only trouble with it is that it takes all day to walk\naround the place, let alone look at any cars as well.\nNeil Masom\nCONGRATULATIONS to everybody for surviving the Fresher s' Dinners and thanks to all\nthe old lags who turned up later to help make each dinner a great success. It is pleasing that for\nthe first time ever our dinners have been mixed and don't seem to have changed in format at all.\nTheM REd inner got a bit rowdy as a result of the\nwaiters being third year miners. To the future; tomorrow( Saturday, November1) we are going to Windsor to sell some Rag Mags have a few beers and maybe take the castle by siege if we have time! All welcome to come,s obe in the R SMU Office at 9 : 3 0 am. During Rag Week we shall beholding a fe te in\nthe Union Building organised by CHAPS, but we shall need all as s it ance that can be offered (the\nfe te is the same night as the Beer Festival upstairs).\nMorphy Day will be here soon so start collecting any rotting matter, e. g.old milk, eggs, vomit, etc). We shall building a float for the Rag Procession on the Saturday in Rag Week and we shall need volunteers and help in design. Finally on Sunday, November30 an R SMA Invitation XV will play the\npresent first team at H arlington at 1 0 : 3 0 a m.All support would be welcome. LAST WEEK'S Alternative Rag Stunt was a great\nsuccess. Thirty people met in the Union Bar at\n1 : 0 0 , including two postgraduates, several assorted thugs and one Ayatollah. They all then trooped down to Harrods and extorted money out of the local populace. At the end of the day \u00a3 4 3 3 . 6 7 l/2 had been collected which makes last\nweek's Guilds collection look rather feeble. Collecting honours goto Terry Ever rit t, Chem2, who collected \u00a3 3 5 . 9 4 , Steve White with \u00a3 3 2 . 8 7\nand Marco Lech wold with \u00a3 3 0 . 6 1 . Congratulations to everyone who took part. Sincere there is no collection tomorrow, there will be a session of Rag Float bu idling int heR CSU Office at2:00 pm. Bring masses of cardboard along with you and discover the fun you can have with a bent pair of scissors and some sell o tape. Next Wednesday,( November5) sees the Ents day out cum Rag Mag trip.

    "content": "Super Prizes!!\nPlease tell me if you think I'm overreacting, but\nI was absolutely amazed by the professional\nway in which John Passmore, at the recent\nU GM, flippantly disregarded the loss of \u00a3500\non the No Dice concert. In fact, he seemed\nquite c huffed by the fact that no one could do\nanything about it. Only one person challenged\nMr Passmore, but he was merely laughed away\nas he happened to be IC's resident fascist,\nWilliam Cortezzi.\nI think I 've said enough about the matter,\nsome of you may think I 've 'harped on' about\nit. So, now's your chance \u2014 all readers\n(especially Club Chairmen) are invited to write\nan essay entitled \"What I would do with \u00a3500\nof Union money if John Passmore had not got\nto it before I could\". A prize of \u00a35 (Union\nmoney, of course) will be offered to the author\nof the essay that makes me laugh the most.\nMotion of Censure\nFirstly, Mary Attenborough has asked me to\napologise for stating that she was the original\nsecond er of Dare Afolabi's motion of censure\nagainst myself. If that's not true, then I must\napologise. However, Liz Lindsay has informed\nme that Daniel Afolabi most definitely put\nforward her name as second er, changing it\nlater. I feel this is a private matter between Dave\nAfolabi and Ms Attenborough, and hence I refuse to apologise. Damian Afolabi may\na polg is e in print if he likes.\nAs for the actual motion, Duncan, we were all\nsorry to hear you had to go into hospital and\nhence were unable to propose it. Still, get well\nsoon, I 've got a libel writ waiting for you.\nKeogh Case\nThe recent Keogh Hall incident, together with\nthe rape in Southside last term points to easy\nfreedom of access.\nAfter a survey of Southside carried out last\nterm by the Union, Domestic Secretary,\nCaptain Lindley, claimed to have tightened up\nthe access. All he has succeeded in doing is\nmaking it more difficult to gain entry to Stan's Bar! Just what the hell is the point of locking\nthis door in-early evening and forcing people to\nenter via the main Southside entrance when\nthe fire escape door near Falmouth/Tizard lies\noff its hinges offering free access to all of the\nhalls both day and night.\nSecurity? Closed access? Residents only?\nCATSPIDDLE!\nCB Radio\nI feel that this issue has now received sufficient\n'air-time' in the letters' pages, so I invite one pro\nCB summing-up letter and one anti-CB letter\nfor next week's issue, after which the topic will\nbe closed. Both letters will be cut at the 300th word, and should be received by Monday,\n5:30pm. The letter should be marked 'summing\nup letter', I will choose the best from each side.\nWell fought chaps!\nFELIX Distribution\nLast week, there were complaints that supplies\nof FELIX ran out too early in various\ndepartments, notably Huxley. 1 have since\naltered my allocations to departments and I think I have it about right now. Copies are left\nin all the main entrances to departments,\nBot/Zoo Common Room, Haldane, Lyon\nPlayfair, Health Centre, Union Office, and\noutside the FELIX Office. None are left in Halls\nof Residence unlike in the past, as I regard this\nas an unfair advantage of living in Hall.\nI have noticed departmental messengers\ntaking substantial amounts for distribution to\nsenior academics and ask for this practise to\nbe restricted, if not ceased altogether. While I like the idea of College staff reading FELIX, I can't justify a short fall for the student\npopulation. One way of insuring good\ncirculation might be to keep 're cy cable' copies\nin common rooms. If social reps could deposit\nabout 20 in the common rooms in the morning\nit might help -\u00bb- it's up to you.\nStudent Journalism\nMark Smith (FELIX Business Manager) and\nmyself attended the NUS Student Journalist\nConference at the weekend. A good time woz\nhad by all.\nWe were amazed to see the level of\njournalistic activity in colleges throughout the\ncountry. We met editors who were afraid to\ncriticise the Union/College for fear of being\nabolished and others who criticised their\ncounty councils. Some newspapers had libel\ninsurance \u2014 v. intriguing. The standard of the\nnewspapers was very variable; initially, one\nwas tempted to disregard the poorer ones, but\nas time progressed we learnt more about their\ndifficulties, mainly lack of money. By the end of\nthe conference we had come to two\nconclusions. We realised how lucky we were at\nIC which actually appreciates its new paper and provides adequate funding; secondly, we\nsaw at first hand the high level of enthusiasm\nfor student newspapers throughout the\ncountry despite lack of resources. The future\nfo student papers and journalism in general\nlooks bright.\nBA Robertson\nDon't forget the ENTS gig in the Great Hall\ntomorrow night at 7:30pm.

If you can work\nout their ages from that before Friday of this\nweek, I 'll buy you a pint.\"\nBut Wodge is as tight-fist ed as he is mentally\nagile, and he knew that without being told that\nthe girls are roughly the same age, Splinter\nwould not be able to solve the problem he had\nbeen set.\nSo how old were Wodge's daughters at the\ntime of this conversation?\nSolutions, comments and criticisms to me\nc/o FELIX Office.

This necessitated in both having stitches and the Police being called. The details of the above are not really relevant. What is\nrelevant is the question of how they( and other) nonresidents gain access to Southside. Following the rape last term, the main Southside doors are locked at6:00 pm each evening. Presumably, these trespassers got in through Stan's Bar and one of the emergency staircases, or t.hrough the supposedly locked doors that some careless resident had not pushed closed. My point is that Security is\neveryone's problem. It is up to each and every student to keep unwanted' guests' out, and avoid repetition of these violent incidents. Yours sincerely\nClive Chandler Keo gh Hall Secretary Dear Sir\nThe section you printed last\nweek on LesS lea th' s complaint presented a totally false account of what actually happened.

Dear Sir\nAs an active aero mode ller I feel I must add my own contribution to the recent correspondence on CB radio. I would like to make it perfectly clear, at the outset, that Iam not opposed to the idea of making part of the electromagnetic spectrum available for the use of everybody, whether it be called' Citizens Band' or' Open Channel' and while Iam forced to agree with the opinion of most CB enthusiasts that the Government's proposed allocation of frequencies in the UHF band is unsatisfactory, what I cannot condone is the use an already overcrowded band by the users of( to quote The Ferr ret, FELIX544)' pirate sets'\nwho do not seem to realise or care about the amount of damage their illegal radiations can cause to other people's property. In his/ her letter, The Ferret, states that only channel16 causes interference to radio controlled models but, a las,t his is not the case. There are twelve radio control frequencies between26.970 and27.255 MHz spaced by25 kHz and a transmission within this band will interfere with radio control sets even if the said transmission does not coincide exactly with one of the twelve frequencies. It can still\nvery easily cause enough degradation of the signal for then> del\nto go completely out of con. r ol usually with destructive, expensive and possibly dangerous results. By the way, due to negotiations with the Government b v various modelling organisations it has been agreed that a selection of frequencies wi'l be made available for aero moa c'l ers in the35 MHz band on to which We may move( a taco it ol between \u00a320 and f fib for the conversion of each set of gear) should we find it necessary, I, for one, will certainly take advantage of this provision if only for peace of mind. I break enough models on my own without any help from the\" Crash your own model aircraft\" brigade. Free speech is\neverybody' s right, but please not on27 MHz. Yours faithfully\nIC MAC Secretary Dear Marshall\nCongratulations on producing such an interesting newsletter for the seventh successive week! Being a person of significant import in the literary world, I thought that a few words of advice concerning your organ would be well appreciated. Try reducing the frequency of your issues; perhaps, to one every three terms? I consider this to be a most suitable arrangement. Indeed, with the invaluable help of my dedicated staff. I intend to produce a magazine this year! It\nshall be called' The Phoenix'. Admittedly, the name isn't very original, in fact it's been used sporadically since1904. Anyway, I chose it because tome the name' The Phoenix' is synonymous with the words\" literary masterpiece\",\" superb quality\",\" artistic endeavour\" and the like. Unfortunately, to many people' The Phoenix' is synonymous with the words\" obscurity\",\" Did you say Felix?\", and\" What?\". Enough of my troubles, what about yours? I heard that you had an acutely embarrassing attack of impulse buying last year. To speed you on your recovery, here' s a pound, use it to appease your bank manager. Support Michael Foot's arches! Here' s to free speech for all, except oppressed minorities. By el or now! Sean Gi bl in PS: As the once famous Clement Freud used to say:\" I hope Henry likes it\".

Two plants\nwere installed over the\nSummer vacation, complete with their own spot\nlighting, presumably at\ngreat expense. However,\nthey have obviously been\nneglected or maltreated\nand one (above) is a drooping shambles of dead and\ndying leaves. Surely something can be done!\nKEOGH K.O. CHAOS!\nKEOGH HALL gallery level was the scene of an attack on Friday night. Two youths of about\nseventeen had gained access to the gallery level and balcony area from Stan's Bar, where they\nhad been drinking earlier In the evening. They were asked to leave by two Keogh Hall residents\nbecause they were making a nuisance of themselves on the gallery; they refused. The Intruder\nbecame violent when It was attempted to persuade them to leave; one of the youths smashed a beer glass over the heads of the two residents trying to remove them.\nRector pleads for money\nSir Andrew Huxley, the Rector, and Sir Henry Fisher\nCommemoration Day, last Thursday, began with a speech by\nthe Rector, Lord Flowers. His speech reflected the economic\nclimate. In appealing for money he drew the attention of the\naudience to the deeds of covenant placed on their seats, and pointed out that if all of this year's graduates were to covenant\n\u00a320 a year for five years the College would receive a quarter of a million pounds.\nHe also commented on the fallin numbers of overseas students( around25%). He felt that this meant we were less able to contribute to the development of the Third World. In conclusion Lord Flowers said:\" If we are not to sink into mediocrity there has to be a major reappraisal of the support of basic research in the universities of the in dust ral is ed countries \u2014 and it is urgent\". Following this address the Associates, Diplomat es, and New Fellows w ree presented. This year's fellows are Sir Andrew Huxley, FRS: Sir Derek Barton, FRS, formerly Hofmann professor of Organic Chemistry; Emeritus Professor AG Gay don, FRS, formerly Professor of Molecular Spectroscopy at Imperial College; Professor R Li'ist of the Federal Republic of Germany; and Mr JP Sow don, Governor of the College since1971. The ceremony ended with an address by Sir Andrew Huxley as special visitor. We have tried to ascertain the subject ol his speech, but noone appears to know; indeed, to those of us there it appeared that Sir Andrew didn't know either. The assailants were subdued when confronted by over a dozen members of Keo gh who had come to investigate the commotion. They were anxious to getaway from trouble, but were taken away by the Police who had been called. Frank Potter, the Warden of Keo gh Hall, has said:\" With the present security set up, there is noway it could have been prevented.\" The two victims were later taken to St Stephens Hospital where they received a total of9 stitches for scalp wounds, but they were not detained overnight. The two intruders were charged and appeared before a magistrate on Monday. One pleaded guilty to causing bodily harm, the other was found not guilty. Mr Reeves, Chief Security Officer, said that there is a trend at Stan's where many un desire able s are able to get into the bar. To combat this he said that an electric locking system is to be employed to close all entry points to Stan's except that via the security guard. He also said that if any student approaches any suspicious persons they should ensure they are well supported. The security guards have been instructed to call the Police if any trouble occurs. He reiterated his view that in this age of increasing violence that there needs to be cooperation between students and security guards to keep Southside safe.\nBoth he and FELIX highly commend those who tackled the intruders in such a public spirited manner.

He admitted that he was unconcerned about the financial loss involved( \u00a3 5 0 0 ) and that he himself was responsible. Mr William Cort azzi attacked the increase in subscription of London\nStudent from200 to300 as a waste of another \u00a3 5 0 0 ; the increase was agreed. Miss Rachel S nee was questioned by Mr Stephen Gould er, FELIX News Editor, over her statement that the trophy thief had been identified; she conceded that her statement was strictly unofficial. In addition, she revealed that the Bookshop is likely to make a loss of around \u00a3 1 0 , 0 0 0 in the current year, which she said' reflected the current economic situation'. During his report, Rich Archer, President of R CSU, confessed that he had been censured by the R CSU General Committee on Monday night(27 th). This was over his use of funds allocated to the Transport Committee to repair the J4 van, without first contacting the Transport Officer, Mr Barney McCabe. Had hedone so, the repairs would not have been so costly as R CSU owns a range of spare J4 parts. Elections were held for the posts of External Affairs Officer and for the Union Finance Committee; Phil Cole and Graham Green contested the E AO post. Mr Bill Robertson was presented with Honorary Life Membership of the Union for his services to the World University Service and the Union. The motions on overseas students and Greek students were passed with no opposition as was the lecturer training motion. The most contentious motion was that on the control of agenda preventing a motion on the same subject being discussed for a second time in a term. Rich Archer, the proposer, said that this motion was essential to get decisions taken promptly at UG Ms; Phil Cole, res on ding to this, said that the motion infringed upon the the freedom of speech of every student. After lengthy questioning a vote was taken and the motion passed. The meeting concluded at about2.25 pm, quo rate to the last! The election results were announced later: Phil Cole212 Graham Green168 Hence Phil Cole was elected as External Affairs Officer. Barney McCabe and Christine Teller were elected to the Finance Committee. CND Rally\nA Sellout\nOVERALL, about 50 students\nof Imperial College joined the\npeace march( of which 20\nleft Beit Arch at the prescribed\ntime); which with the West\nLondon Chaplaincy group, and a few lecturers, made\nquite a respectable turnout.\nBut, with no ICU banner to\nrally round, the groups disp ers ed to join different sections of marchers.\nThe C ND had anticipated a50,000 strong turnout which was easily surpassed; people were still\narriving at Trafalgar Square even after the speeches had ended. The list of speakers included: David Alton( from the Liberal Party) who said he didn't trust MPs, least of all of the Tory variety; Susannah York; EP Thompson, who bought international messages of support from MIT and the Greek, Belgian and Dutch anti nuclear movements, all of whom have had great successes recently in \u2022 their own countries. Tony Benn who was warmly received, asked the media to report this march correctly( for a change); others followed, but the secretary of the C ND provided a more lighthearted final speech wondering how the' Gang of One' would rule\" a bunch of mutants'. Queen Mary College showing their colours at Piccadilly.\nNuke in Sherfield\nON FRIDAY7 th November the BBC will be filming a lecture and discussion entitled' Towards the final abyss?' about nuclear weapons at 7.30 p.m. in the Great Hall in S her field. The lecture is\npart of an Open University series\nand it will be broadcast on Sunday30 November and repeated the following Sunday. The lecturer is Professor Michael Pentz, Dean of Science at the Open University. It is hoped that a member of staff from IC will chair the lecture and discussion. All stall and students are welcome to attend. NUS Student\nJournalist Conference\nThe NUS Student Journalist Conference was held last weekend\nat the City University. This was the largest gathering of student\njournalists ever held in Britain with over ninety newspapers\nrepresented. In addition a one day meeting of the National\nAssociation of Student Broadcasting was held on Saturday to\ncoincide with the conference.\nSteve Marshal landMark Smith( FELIX Business Manager) attended the\nconference on behalf of FELIX in the guise of London Student reps, as Imperial is\nd is affiliated from the NU S.IC Radio sent four representatives to the one day radio conference.\nThe journalist conference was opened by David Aaron ov itch, NUS President,\nwho devoted his speech to stating how disorganised the DES were in their\nhandling of the controversial student union financing issue. Later, Ian Cox on, NUS Press and Publicity Officer, and other NUS staff demonstrated how\ndisorganised the NUS were in their handling of the conference. The first day ended with a rather useless newspaper production workshop, and of course, the\nBar.\nMike Power of the National Graphical Association( one of the main print\nunions) gave an amazing insight into the bol shi e ness of their union which made us\nIC boys glad to employ 'scab printers' for all Union publications. This attitude\nwas, of course, looked down upon by most of the left conference delegates.\nMidday saw the presentation of the NUS/ Guardian student newspaper awards which FELIX cannot enter due to our diss affiliation. The Mancunian\n( Manchester University) was voted best large college paper and was awarded a j \u00a3250 prize. Invoice ( New Uni of Ulster) won the best small college paper award of\n_\u00a3250. The Lancaster birdlife magazine, Curlew, won the best specialised coverage\naward( \u00a3 1 0 0 ) .\nWhile teaching absolutely nothing about newspaper production, the\nconference did provide valuable contact with other college papers and was\nthoroughly worthwhile. London student\nnewspaper organisation\nREPRESENTATIVES of all London student newspapers are meeting at UL U on Tuesday, November4 to discuss the formation of a newspaper organisation. Such a body is most desirable; it could serve to increase contact between London Colleges and would be invaluable for London Student, enabling it to present a very comprehensive inter College news service. It is likely that MrS J Marshall, our own esteemed Editor, will take on the Chairmanship of the body as he is one of the few London Sabbatical Editors. Paul Segal, sabbatical Editor of London Student, initiated the idea but is unwilling to pursue the idea. FELIX, October 31, 1980 Page 3\n\n"

    "content": "Theatre\nThe Romans\nin Britain\nOlivier Theatre\nCONSIDERING the fuss everyone is making\nabout this play, it turned out to be really rather\ndisappointing, being neither entertaining nor\ninformative. The play has three settings; the\nfirst act is set in Ancient Britain at the time of\nthe Roman invasion, and the second act is split\nbetween modern Ireland (near the border) and\nBritain at the time of the Saxon invasions. The\nlatter two subplots ran concurrently, the\ncharacters from each era being conveniently\nasleep or deceased when action is occurring in\nthe other time zone.\nThe idea of this, it would appear, is to draw\ncomparison between the contemporary situation in Northern Ireland and the aforementioned\nRoman and Saxon invasions. An interesting\nidea, but it doesn't work. There are no obvious\ncorrelations between the three situations as\npresented here, other than the (hardly original)\nmessage that War Is Hell. The result is\nsomewhat perplexing; the first act has no\nbearing whatever on the events of the second\nand the two subplots in the second act\nintermingle confusingly.\nRecords\nRemain\nin Light\nTalking Heads\nRemain In Light is the fourth album from\nAmerican art rock band Talking Heads. As\nwith past albums, it represents a stage in the\nevolution of a 'modernist' sound. Each album\ndevelops the ideas of the former, while\nretaining the traditional Heads sound.\nUnlike most modernist rock bands, the\nHeads actually achieve something new \u2014\ncertainly none of the Numanesque fake\noriginality. And the result is not some stab at\nwhat rock might sound like in the future, but\na development of traditions in new ways.\n'I Zimbra' from Fear Of Music is perhaps the\nbest indication on the last album of the way\nRemain in Light has developed. It is not\nsurprising to find, therefore, that Brian Eno,\nwho wrote 'I Zimbra', has produced the new\nalbum and co-written all of the songs.\nThoughtful, serious; the lyrics here become\nmore obscure, but have not yet reached the\nlevel of Cars songs, where words are used\npredominantly for their sound, rather than\ntheir meaning. But they are still writing songs\nabout buildings and people.\nJohn Miller\nBoth the Roman and the Saxon sections\nsuffer badly from a lack of storyline.\nCharacters come and go in bewildering abandon, and no sooner are we introduced to a character\nthan he is horribly killed by some means or\nother (suicide, stabbing, yellow fever,\nand slit throats are just a few of the\ndelightful exits made. The much publicised obscenity in the play lies chiefly\nin the scene in which three young Celtic\nthe stage, and are caught by a trio ot Komans\nout for a good time. After two of the Celts are\nkilled, the third is held down by one of the\nRomans while one of the others simulates the\nact of bugger y( he gives up after a couple of\nminutes, complaining that he \"can't get it up.\nHe's just a mass of piles!\"). I found this scene\nneither particularly tasteful nor necessary to\nthe action, but there you go.\nThe section of the play set in modern times\nwas somewhat better in that it had a discern able if somewhat slow moving plot. A British army officer is waiting in a field near the\nborder in order to meet, and then assassinate,\na high-ranking IRA member. We later discover\nthat while he is waiting, although he appears\nnot to be at the time, he is actually witnessing\nin some way the events going on in the Saxon\nera. These 'visions' (and, presumably, the\nbottle of whiskey he drinks to pass the time)\naffect his sense of justice and morality so\nprofoundly that when the IRA chap finally\nstrolls along he willingly reveals himself as an\narmy officer, thereby wrecking months of\ncareful planning. Result: he gets shot.\nWonderful. Quite honestly, I think this play is a total waste of time and money (it costs \u00a33.30\nwith a Unioncard, and you can get tickets in\nadvance at this price). I suggest you give it a miss.\nDove Jago\nUnion Lower Refectory\nRamones - EP\nFOUR songs from past Ramones' albums: 'I Just Want To Have Something To Do', 'Here\nToday, Gone Tomorrow', 'I Wanna Be Your\nBoyfriend', and 'Questioningly'. They are\nawful, so go and buy it cos it's great. Pity it\ndoes not include any of the wonderful over\nproduction of Phil Spector from End Of The\nCentury, but it is more likely to win new\nconverts than was that album,\nJohn Miller\nWhat' son Friday, November 31\n\u2022Christian Union: Jesus Said I am the Good Shepherd,\nArthur Pont 6:30pm,53 Princes Gate.\nSunday, November 2\n\u2022Wargames Club Meeting, 1:00pm, SCR.\nMonday, November 3\n\u2022Environmental Society Inaugral Meeting, 1:00pm,4 th floor, 48 Princes Gdns, ICCET.

    "content": "Reviews\nIF I 'DALLTHE MONEY I 'VE SPENT ON DRINK,\nIWOULDSPENDITON DRINK\"\nCertificate AA. Starring Trevor Howard,\nVivian Stanshall and Patrick Magee.\nDirected by Steve Roberts. Now showing\nat the Paris Pullman.\nIT ISN'T very often that a significant comedy\nfeature surfaces from amongst the host of\nglossy Hollywood imports. Fortunately, the\nBritish film industry has not sank so low as to\nstop producing the occasional gem to sweeten\nthe bitter pill of American domination.\n'Sir Henry' is the grotesque image of English\neccentricity generated, undoubtedly, in one of\nthe darker recesses of Vivian StanshalPs brain.\nIf the name rings a bell, I should explain that\nViv is a former member of the Bonzo Dog Doo\nDah Band, whose meteoric rise to stardom in\nthe sixties and subsequent fragmentation may\nbe familiar to you. This film is the extension of\nthe Sir Henry theme, which was originally\nserial is ed by John Peel, recorded on disc and\neven transformed into a successful stage\nproduction. Now, Charisma Films have produced a screen comedy of great merit.\nBefore I continue I must explain my own\nlack of familiarity with the said waxing; I have\nno idea whether the film will offend those\nalready informed about the antics at Rawlinson\nEnd. Personally, I found the screen presentation\nto be both hilarious and refreshingly new.\nWhat of the film itself? Trevor Howard gives\nanother exceptional performance in the lead\n(indeed, on the Parkinson show he admitted it\nwas his most enjoyable role to date), with\nstrong support from Stanshall as his brother\nHubert and Patrick Magee as Reverend Slodden.\nAs far as the plot goes, suffice it to say that\nI'm still not quite sure by which route the end\nwas reached. In a series of hilarious (if a little\nconfused) scenes, the lifestyle of Sir Henry and\nhis assorted acquaintances is revealed. There's Old Scrotum, the wrinkled retainer,\nMrs E the housekeeper and another brother\n(Humbert) who is prematurely dispatched to\nthe great beyond by accident, and comes back\nto haunt Rawlinson End. For good measure\nthere's also Max and Joachim, two Germans\nkept by Sir Henry in his own POW camp since\nthe war. Various relatives complete the strange\ninhabitants of Sir Henry's abode.\nWhen Humbert appears (spiritually) once\ntoo often, Sir Henry enrolls Reverend Slodden's help for an exorcism. Meanwhile\nBuller Bullethead (Harry Fowler) witnesses the\nvarious novel escape attempts of Max and\nJoachim, after his suspicions were aroused by\nSir Henry's unicycle ride to the local sewage\nfarm dressed as an 'impecunious jungle-bunny'. Various other twists occur which are\nfar too complex to detail, but on the whole\nmoments of hilarious comedy shine out from\namongst the apparent confusion.\nThe film is now showing at the Paris Pullman\nwith The Running? Jumping Standing Still Film\nstarring Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan. I'd say\nit was one of those rare comic treats which are\ntoo good to miss.\nMark Smith\nCaligula\nCertificate X. Starring Malcolm\nMcDowell. Now showing at Prince\nCharles Cinema.\nAs you may have noticed, Caligula (billed as\n\"arguably the most controversial film ever\")\nopened at the Prince Charles cinema yesterday. I had the dubious privilege of seeing\nCaligula whilst I was in Amsterdam a month\nago, and I suspect that the main controversy\nsurrounds the claim that the highly pornographic content of the film is in some way\nartistic.\nIt begins with an idyllic scene: Caligula\n(Malcolm McDowell) romping with his sister in a soft-focus forest. All very tasteful. Tiberius\n(played by a scabby-looking Peter OToole)\nsoon lowers the tone of the film as he lounges\nbeside his Roman Jacuzzi, surrounded by\nslaves, whilst elsewhere in his villa, women are\nmecha nci ally masturbated, whipped and tortured, and even the guards are in danger of\nbeing eviscerated.\nHowever, Tiberius doesn't last long, and his\nadviser, Nerva (Sir John Gielgud) commits\nsuicide shortly afterwards in true Roman style.\nFrom this point onwards, with Caligula as\nemperor, the plot alternates between executions and orgies (including the incident\nwhen the senators wives are forced into\nprostitution), all lavishly recreated, until\nCaligula is assassinated and Claudius is\nacclaimed emperor.\nA number of scenes in the film \u2014 for\nexample, the girl performing 'deep throat', the\nclose up lesbian love scenes and the disembowelling \u2014 will probably have been\nheavily censored, and if so, there will be very\nlittle left (surely more interesting things were\nhappening in Rome).\nIt comes as no surprise to learn that\nCaligula is a Penthouse production; what is\nsurprising is that several well-known actors\nshould agree to appear in it.\nSimon Hodgson\nWalt Disney's Certificate U. Starring Snow White,\nHappy, Dopey, Grumpy, Sneezy, Bashful,\nSleepy, and Doc. Directed by David\nHand. Now showing at the Classic,\nHaymarket.\nIn a run-up to Christmas, this 1937 feature\nfrom Walt Disney was re-released last week.\nAs the first true full-length animated film it\nwas an ambitious project which took just over\nfour years to produce, involved 750 different\nartists and used about a quarter of the one\nmillion separate drawings they produced.\nMost of you will, no doubt, be familiar with\nthe film. It is loosely based on a Grimms fairy\ntale and still seems to captivate an audience of\nyoung and old alike. The classic \"good versus\nevil\" plot centres on the attempts of an evil\nqueen to dispatch her beautiful stepdaughter,\ndue to mum's insane jealousy. Making the\nobvious mistake of trusting the good hearted\nhuntsman to do her dirty work, Snow White\nescapes death and stumbles across a sort of\nmini-commune of seven well-rounded dwarfs.\nReturning from a hard day down t' pit, the\njolly seven some find Snow White has cleared\nup their filth and, after a little sweet talking/singing let her stay. However, her\nblack-hearted stepmother isn't finished yet.\nAfter another chat with a very clever mirror,\nshe hot foots it out into the forest in the guise\nof an old hag offering free bites on a poisoned\napple.\nWell, needless to say, things eventually end\nup happily. A few questions may pass by\nyounger eyes though. For instance, where on\nearth did these seven little men appear from\nand what happened to all the little women? Is\nSnow White really so daft as to trust strange\nold ladies (admittedly not Greek) bearing gifts?\nAnyway, I wouldn't let such trivia bother\nyou. I really did enjoy this charming story. The\nanimation is surprisingly good and I just can't kick whistling \"Heigh-Ho\" (one of the eight\nsongs in the film which used an 80 piece\norchestra). It's undoubtedly a sound alternative to a Motorhead gig, or whatever\nelse you do with your spare time.\nMark Smith\nS no oi White, in a flagrant display of\nfavour it is m, gives Dopey a smacker on his\nbald patch (his head). It must have been the\ncombination of a baggy cloak, toothy grin and\nan ability to waggle his ears which won her\nover. Take note. You too could win the heart\nof your own princess.\nFELIX, October 31, 1980 Page 7\n\n"
