    "content": "Editorial\nThe carefree days of Easter are over, it's term-time again, and the sun is no longer\nshining in Happy Bunny Land.\n(Translation: It's Summer term, and thus\nexam time, so things are looking a bit\ngrim). Just under a third of the current\nundergraduates will be taking their finals,\nand looking to other things. Whether the\ncareers service continues to be as helpful\nand useful in the future for the next\ngenerations of survivors of the Imperial\nCollege experience, well...\nMore nonsense, Mr Mee?\nIn the Easter Special (issue 900) I wrote\nabout the College plan to d is affiliate from\nULCAS (the University of London Careers\nAdvisory Service). A couple of hours after\nthe issue was distributed the Rector rang\nme, concerned about some of the points I had made. We agreed that he would\nwrite an article presenting his views on\nthe subject, to be printed this term.\nHowever, in the meantime, PE Mee, the\nCollege Registrar, wrote a letter, which\nwas printed last week. The Rector, when\nasked, was of the opinion that his article\nwould thus be unnecessary. Thus I assume that Mr Mee's letter covers the\npoints he was concerned with.\nMr Mee claims that the editorial was\n'...peppered...' with '...misunderstandings\nand misconceptions...'. This is interesting,\nconsidering the number in his own reply.\nHe states that 'There is no question of a direct labour policy' (a situation where\nthe careers service would try to push\nstudents into careers related to their\ndegree, and thus reduce the level of\nindividual choice of career. Very bad. See\nissue 900's editorial for more). He fails to\nsay that the only reason we can rely on\nthis is due to the student pressure\nbrought upon them, which has resulted in\na policy paper on careers advice being\ndrawn up, which will ensure that this\ndoes not happen.\nHe also attempts to imply that few IC\nstudents use ULCAS's Gordon Square\nfacilities, by saying that only '...70 IC\nstudents used the Gordon Square milk-round this year'. He neglects to say that\nfar more than this used the libraries and\nother facilities. Neither has there been\nany guarantee that the new IC careers\nservice will cover the individual costs of\nstudents using these facilities, which could\nmean that students will have to pay\nthemselves (estimated to be \u00a35 for a day\nof research next year).\nThe statement that 'There are no 'start-up' investment costs of which Angus\nFraser is unaware' is interesting, to say\nthe least. Benjamin Turner asked Mr\nFraser whether he was aware that the\ncosts proposed by Mr Mee did not include\nthose necessary to upgrade the current\ncareers library, and he replied that he\nwas not. The Careers Advisors Committee\nestimated that the library was currently\nonly at 10% of the level of typical standalone services. Of course, the plan could\nbe to send people to Gordon Square, and\nnot update our library, but that rather\nbegs the question of why are we\nd is affiliating in the first place, if we are to\ncontinue to use ULCAS facilities?\nEspecially when the students themselves\nmay have to pay.\nWhen discussing the Association of\nGraduate Careers Advisory Services Mr\nMee claims that '...our links are likely to\nbe stronger'. He again neglects to say\nthat the main reason for this is the policy\npaper mentioned above, which was\ndrawn up solely due to student pressure,\nand that without this our links to AGCAS\ncould well have been severely weakened.\nAt no point did I conclude that there\nwas a'... conspiracy to damage the\ncareers service.' I was merely pointing\nout that while His Rectorness et al claim\nthey are '...trying to build a stronger,\nbetter careers service...', almost\neverybody else that was consulted by\nBenjamin Turner disagreed, and most of\nthem were professional graduate careers\nadvisors, or prominent members of\nvarious graduate careers services.\nSo why do the Rector and gang think\nthey know better? What do they know\nthat the experts don't? That's what\nimmediately sprang to my mind. Nobody\nseemed to know the answer to that one.\nSo maybe, just maybe, there were other\nreasons for their decision. This is what I was attempting to point out to the people\nwho will actually be using the service,\nand will actually be looking for jobs after\ntheir degree. I was not trying to suggest\nthat they were deliberately conspiring to\ndamage the careers service, just that\nthere may be other reasons for the\nd is affiliation, but as a by product the\nservice would, in the opinions of those far\nmore qualified than myself, and maybe\neven than His Rectorness and gang, suffer\nfrom the move.\nSmall Ads\nFOR SALE\n\u2022LT 700 Cycle Helmet.

    "content": "Sunset Animals Russian\nBoycott\nThe Jewish Society is taking part in a national campaign to stop the British\nGovernment taking part in a Human\nRights conference in Moscow. According\nto the society, the government had\npreviously stated that the visit would not\ngo ahead unless improvement were seen\nin six Human Rights areas. As of now,\nthe condition have only been met in two\nof these.\nThe Jewish society is therefore\npetitioning the Home Secretary, Douglas\nHurd, to boycott the conference. Those\nwishing to sign the petition, or write a letter can meet the Jewish Society in the\nJCR on Thursday.\nAt the Board of Studies meeting this\nweek the decision to lengthen the College\nDay was deferred. Professor Alan\nSwanson, Chairman of the working party\nto look into the extension gave his\nreport, and although he made no official\nrecommendations, commented that he\npersonally was in favour of the college\nday being lengthened.\nProfessor David Blow, despite being in\nfavour of a longer College day, spoke\nagainst the decision being taken at the\nmeeting on the grounds that further\ndiscussion was needed. The Rector, Sir\nEric Ash, suggested that the extended day\nshould be tried for a test period, but this\ntoo was rejected.\nThe Rector then asked if he could put\nhis point of view to the students, so that\ntheir view on the matter could be taken\ninto consideration. Deputy President, Ben\nTurner, said that the Rector would be\nallowed to speak at an Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting (EGM) which would soon\nbe called to express the student view\nbefore the next Board of Studies Meeting\non the 19th June.\nIC Goes Abroad& m mw mm mgm Professor David Phillips, demonstrating the magic of science\nImperial College was the star attraction at\nthe opening of the largest science\nmuseum in Hong Kong last week. The\ncentre uses new hand-on technology to\nexplain modern scientific discoveries.\nProfessor David Phillips, Dr Bob Spears,\nDr Tim Seller and Melanie Thody (School\nLiason Officer) represented IC in\npromoting the use of exciting\ndemonstrative teaching methods. The\nexternal lias on team gave lectures to rapt\naudiences of school children, followed by\nworkshops to show teachers how to use\nthe imaginative demonstration techniques\nin their classrooms. The event was\nsponsored by Shell Hong Kong and is\nexpected to bring money, as well as new\nstudents, to the college.\nOn Saturday 27th March an estimated\nfifteen thousand people gathered in Hyde\nPark for the largest anti-vivisection march\never seen in Britain.\nThe route, south along Park Lane,\nalong Piccadilly and finally into Trafalgar\nSquare caused congestion for over an\nhour. The head of the march arrived at\naround half past three with people still\ncomin through over half an hour later. It\nwas estimated that over 20,000 people\nwere present filling the entire square.\nAt a quarter to four representatives of\nvarious anti-vivisection and animal rights\ngroups spoke on subjects such as the\nuselessness and unreliability of animal\ntests and violations of regulations\ncovering vivisection. According to\nrepresentatives from the National AntiVivisection Society (NAVS) over 3.5million an in als are killed in the UK every year\nand over 100 million world wide.\nAfter the rally people were invited to\nattend an exhibition in Central Halls,\nStorey's Gate (just off Parliament Square)\nwhere there were stalls and films\nprovided by local and national\norganisations.\nThe march passed off peacefully with\nno reports of trouble.\nTheft Bit\nThe mail, taken from the Imperial College\npost van stolen during the Easter vacation,\nwas found last Wednesday. It was located\nin a used garage on a run down Peckham\nEstate.

    "content": "Scribblers' Corner\nCollege Day, Will The Rector\nEver Listen to Reason?\nFelix,\nI have just sat through a Board of\nStudies (BoS) meeting at which the\nWorking Party on the College Day\nsubmitted a report. The report seems\nvery well-balanced and appears to put\nforward admirably the pros and cons of\nthe day length extension. Professor\nSwanson has done the job he was asked\nto do and did it well. I sat there and\nwatched the Chairmen of BoS (The\nRector Sir Eric Ash) in action, this\nproposal is his baby as you can tell. He is\ndefinitely looking at the matter through\nrose-coloured glasses; he will not hear\nanything detrimental about his ideas. He\nseems determined to bulldozer this\nthrough as soon as possible. He does not\nseem to appreciate the implications such\na proposal will make to the working of\nIC, even though it has been written down\nin black and white by Professor Swanson.\nThe students need to be shown the for\nand against, have the implications\nexplained (ie no extra lecture time, just\nmere prospective slots for the lecturers to\nsit in) but also technician and lecturer\ntrade unions must be consulted as far as\ncontracts and hours of working are\ninvolved.\nThe Rector wanted this to start as from\nOctober ie next term but this will not\nhappen as all the above have to be\nconsulted and their positions taken into\naccount. At the present Professor\nSwanson has to be told to tout for\nresponses from those already mentioned\nand to report back to the June BoS with,\nif all concerned agree and the Rector's badgering pays off, any proposals started\nSpring-term '92. In the meantime\nhopefully ICU will undertake a referendum of opinions, (once all students\nare clued up) to aid Professor Swanson.\nThis must be done in a fool-proof manner\nso that it is not disregarded as biased\nrubbish. Therefore standby for another\nquestionnaire or the like and make sure\nyou know the facts and how they may or\nmay not affect you.

    "content": "It must not be overlong and the head movements must not be too vigorous\n0m. To Boldly Go-The Story Continues\nBanning the Banned\u2014An Interview\nOver the past three weeks, starting on\n8th April, Channel 4 broadcast a unique\nseason of programmes and films, that\nmade television history in this country.\nFor the first time a broadcasting station\nexamined the issues of censorship within\nbroadcasting. The season called 'Banned'\nwas a brave and wide-ranging look at the\nproblems of who censors, why and how\nwe should respond. They showed the\nfilms, previously prevented from public\nbroadcasting, including 'Life of Brian',\n'Brimstone and Treacle', 'Freaks' and\n'Cabinet' from Duncan Campbell's 'Secret\nSociety' Series. As the BBC were\nunwilling to allow Channel 4 to broadcast\n'Cabinet', they had to remake it\nthemselves.\nThis was a minor problem for the\nproducers of 'Banned', who were\nnegotiating with ITC - the committee that\njudges what should or should not be\nshown - before and throughout the .\nseason, hoping to persuade them to allow\nthe most controversial programmes to be\nshown. It was ITC who insisted that 'Life\nof Brian' could only be :how n after\n10:30pm. Even so Mary Whitehouse\nwrote to complain and over 250 phone\ncalls were received before the film went\nout.\nUp until the last moment Kim Peat,\nfrom Channel 4's current affairs, was\nhoping that they would receive\npermission to broadcast 'Dick', a fifteen\nminute film showing 1000 flaccid penises\nin black and white with 100 women's hilarious comments. The flaccid penis is\nnot banned from television, but the\nregulations recommend limitations on\nexposure time, fifteen minutes was\nconsidered excessive. A decision Kim,\nand the American film-maker Jo Menell,\ncould not understand considering how\ninoffensive the film is compared to other\nitems broadcast during the season. Jo,\nspeaking at Imperial in Saturday's conference on censorship, expressed his\nsurprise at the banning as Jeremy Isaacs,\nthe first chief executive of Channel 4, had\ntold him that he would definitely have\nallowed the film to be shown if he had\nstill been in charge.\nOne of the prompts for the idea of a season on censorship came from a series\nof three films, 'The Truth About Lies',\ncommissioned by Channel 4 some time\nago. These were produced by Michael\nJones and his team at Panoptic, an\nindependent film company. Michael, as a guest speaker at IC's conference, showed\nclips from his documentary, 'Sex and the\nCensors', a history of sexual censorship in\nBritain. He explained the rules of\ncensorship; if fellatio is shown it must be\na position that allows for imitation, it\nmust not be overlong, and the head\nmovements must not be too vigorous.\nDue to censored clips from Michael\nWinner's film 'Death Wish 2' and the\nextremely violent 'New York Ripper', the\nformer showing rape, the latter a breast\ncut in half, being shown as part of 'Sex\nand the Censors' at 9:00pm the ITC was\ninfuriated. This may have affected their\nattitude to the rest of the season,\nincluding their continued opposition to\n'Dick'.\nKim hoped that their season would\nbecome a landmark in broadcasting that\nwould encourage or empower other\nbroadcasters and journalists to fight and\nstruggle against unfair censorship. In\nreferring to the process of censorship she\nexplained that much of it was due to a complex compilation of small decisions\nbuilding up to the ultimate consequence\nof banning. This portrayal of the grey ness of why decisions were taken, and by\nwhom, was a part of creating a forum in\nAmong the aspects of information\ncontrol examined were the pressure put\non television by advertisers. The episode\nof 'Thirty Something', that showed two\nmen in bed, produced a withdrawal of\nadvertising from eight companies when it\nwas shown in America. When asked\nabout the response to 'Banned' Kim\nexplained that only one programme\nreceived no advertising, 'The Animal's Film', as advertising executives at C4\nthought there would be no market for the\nspace. She went on to stress that they are\none step removed from the pressure of\nadvertisers and would not have heard of\nany complaints even if they had been\nreceived.\nOne complainer, amongst many, was a woman in a wheelchair, who visited the\ntelevision studios to comment on the\nshowing of the film 'Freaks'. She spent\nover half an hour with Kim Peat\ndiscussing the implications of the\nportrayal of handicapped people in the\nfilm. The major reason why the season\nwas conceived, and broadcast, was to\ncreate debate. It forced discussion of the\nissues within C4, especially within the\nITC, and has created argument in\nnewspaper leaders, letter pages, on radio\nand on the streets. IC's event 'To Boldly\nGo' was a major part of encouraging a response from students. It will be\nfollowed up over this term with an\nexhibition accompanied by a book and\ninformation fair in the JCR, along with\nspeaker meetings within college. Look out\nfor the posters.\nwhich the simplicity of the too common\ndogmatic is m of debates on censorship\nwould be challenged. Kim concluded that\nthe season was about creating 'awareness\nabout the various different types of\ncensorship, how it works, who is\nresponsible and what we as citizens can\ndo about it'.\nI wish to thank Kim Peat, Editorial\nAdministrator for Factual Programmes,\nC4, for allowing us to interview her and\nfor the invaluable assistance she gave to\nthe Huxley Society's event 'To Boldly Go'.\nWorld Report\nARTICLE 19 published their 'World\nReport 1991' on 'Information Freedom\nand Censorship' last month. It covers 77\ncountries, describing cases of\ninfringement of the human right, as\nstated in the UN Declaration, of freedom\nof expression, speech and belief.\nIn all there are eleven pages on the\nUnited Kingdom, which starts with the\nfollowing sobering paragraph:\nARTICLE 19\nINTERNATIONAL CENTRE AGAINST CENSORSHIP\n'...There is no constitutionally significant\nprotection of freedom of expression or of\ninformation. Any protection there is\ndepends upon conventions of restraint on\nthe part of the law- making and law-enforcing authorities. Restraint does exist\nbut has become increasingly superficial.\nThis has been amply demonstrated in\nrecent years as former Prime Minister\nMargaret Thatcher sought to re-assert\nsecrecy as a central principle of\ngovernment...'\nThere is a whole page on 'Satanic\nVerses' and the blasphemy law, also\nreferring to the banned film 'Visions of\nEcstasy', the first ever censored for\nblasphemy.

The Oromo, as well as\nARTICLE 19 were represented at the\nconference 'To Boldly Go' last Saturday at\nIC.

You've heard of the\nAborigines. You may have even heard of\nthe Tasmanians - who were completely\nwiped out, as extinct as the Dodo. Yet\nwho are the Oromo?\nIn their own land their language is\n'effectively banned from public use', their\nculture and religious institutions have\nbeen nearly destroyed through\ncolonization and slavery, they are now\npersecuted for being Muslims and\nProtestant Christians. Over 400,000 have\nbecome refugees and 3-4 million are\ndisplaced within their own homeland.\nThe Oromo are the largest ethnic group\nin NE Africa, numbering over 20 million.\nWhen you see pictures of the starving in\nEthiopia, the likely hood is that they are\nOromo. Why have we never heard of\nthem? Why do we not campaign on their\nrights to their own culture and dignity?\nLike the Kurds and Turkey's failure to\nrecognise them and their culture, until\nthe recent tragedy, the Oromo are not\nrecognised by the military dictatorship in\nEthiopia. The Kurdish plight of fleeing\nmillions from Saddam gains the attention\nof the press and Jeffrey Archer, along\nwith international music stars.

His attempts to warn the local\npeople are thwarted by censorship and\nultimately hatred.\nThe enemy of the people are the\npeople, who do not wish to hear the\nproblems that face them, they feel secure\nin their ignorance. For the factory is the\nmajor source of employment in the town.\nHe is threatened for being a disrupt er,a threat to society, and is forced to leave\nthe town.\nWhere is justice at Imperial? Many\nstudents will see this as an irrelevant\nquestion. What has justice to do with IC?\nWhat kind of community do we live and\nwork in here? Does it support the\nconcepts of truth or are we public\nenemies?\nThe 'Index on Censorship', whose editor\nAndrew Graham-Yooll spoke at 'To\nBoldly Go', carries articles that examine\ncensorship throughout the world.

This is extraordinary\nsince this film bears absolutely no traces\nof this heritage, perhaps due to the work\nof the cinematographer and editor. For\nexample, at no point does the Predator\nannounce that it is the future of the\nworld, although now and again it does\nflash its fishnet clad legs at the camera.\nDanny Glover covers for Arnie (now\nthat the big man has gone on to\nproducing cute kiddy films) with a screen\nperformance almost, but not quite, the\nsame as his role in Lethal Weapon. The\nmain difference being that he has no\nmoustache. Also he is harder than a bull\nwith BSE and romps impressively from\none pitched battle to another. Said battles\nare initially between various warring drug\nbarons (again) until a third party (oddly\nenough, not Cap'n Birdseye) begins to\nsteadily fraction any faction who happens\nto be around, and draws the wrath of\nGlover upon its scaly head. This doesn't worry it too much since it is played by\nKevin Peter Hall who is seven feet two\ninches tall and it has four jaws to boot\n(not mentioning an arsenal of hi-tech doo-dahs that could perform a certain Jewish\noperation on a gnat at 200 yards). Given\nthis enviable mandibular largesse it's not\nsurprising that he quickly racks up a body count most easily measured in\nStandard Index Form, and since he's already picked Danny for his prize his\nunfortunate ornaments are mostly\ncomposed of hoods and the odd hapless\npoliceman.\nInevitably enough a third group has to\nenter the scene, the Well-Meaning But\nMisguided team of Feds. Having served to\nestablish a link with the first movie they\nproceed to wander in and out of the\nscript now and again, holding Danny\nback as only the FBI can.\nThat's about all there is to the plot save\nfor a comprehensive A to Z of stereotype\nethnic bad guys. However, what seems\nlike a never-ending series of clich es in\nprint is in fact fairly lucid and smooth on\nscreen; the interest in this film lies in the\nself-consistency it presents and more\nimportantly in the stunning visuals.\nSpecial effects are not too far to the fore,\ntaking second place to pace and slick\nediting (particularly in a brilliant subway\nsequence shot entirely in st robing light).\nMore action than its predecessor but a little less suspense; a good film even if\nthe Predator's spaceship does look like a set from a high budget episode of Doctor\nWho (fluorescent painted walls); and\nthere's more than a hint of a possible\nPredator 3.\nThe Amazing Flying Gerbil Machine\nHighlander II\nHighlander II , The Quickening\nQuicker than what ? A mono ped tortoise on Mogadon ? This sad\nlittle sequel has more holes than a Swiss\ncheese caught in Robo-Cop III. Connor\nMcCloud (Christopher Lambert) is back\nafter having won 'the prize' (Brucey\nBonus) giving him the power to guide\nmankind and be mortal. His guidance\nleads to the erection of an amazing laser\nshield to replace the ozone layer (honest).\nGreat idea at the time (1999); twenty-five\nyears later it's a real bummer as it keeps\nin the smog and allows no rain . Now\nConnor is effectively 75 years old and\nsuddenly remembers that he and all the\nother eternal s were from the purple\nplanet Zeist and were exiled by the\nwicked dictator for trying to rebel. Added\nto this is a magic bond between Ramirez\n(Sean Connery) and McCloud which is a bit like Jiminy Cricket's 'Give a little\nwhistle' if you need a friend . I guess\nthey just forgot to tell us this in the first\none .\nHaving left the Highlander in exile for\nover 500 years and now on the verge of\ndeath by old age the evil General Katana\n(Michael Ironside) decides this is a prime\nopportunity to send two flying porcupine\nmen to assassinate him. This leads to\nrejuvenation, ecological commando raids\nand an overall plot that Hanna Barbera\nwould think twice about.\nOn the plus side the special effects are\nstunning and the sets (at times) are\nbreathtaking. Some scenes are very good,\nespecially a slow motion piece where the\nbig two Rebels without a Zeist are\nmachine gunned, although other parts ,\nthe majority could easily turn up in the\nA Team .\nThis film sits happily on the wrong side\nof average . No Queen sound track ,\nawful plot , terrible accents and it doesn't fit in with the first film .

    "content": "The Doors\nWell, here it is kids, but when did\nold father Hype last deliver all he\npromised, I hear you ask?\nThe film is directed by Oliver Stone\n(Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, etc)\nand stars Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison,\nwith Meg Ryan as Jim's 'girl', Pamela\nCurson, and Kyle MacLachlan (currently\nstarring in a crappy serial on the box) as\nthe Door's keyboardist, Ray Manzarek.\nAfter having seen the film you realise\nthat the film is mis titled \u2014it should have\nbeen called something along the lines of\nJim, the Demi-God. The film isn't so much\nabout the band as it is about a 'legend';\nthe film-makers obviously realised that it\nwould be much easier for audiences to\norgasm at the sight of Morrison than the\nidea of four guys making some fucking\ngroovy music. The film is out to make\nmyths; myth being hype, being dollars.\nIn fact the first half of the film leaves\nthe impression that Morrison was a real\nasshole\u2014the film is riddled with\nHollywood clich es about sensitive\nintellectual (ish) artists who find fame,\nfortune and glory too hot to handle.\nWhat fascinates most is Morrison's self-destructiveness, his alcohol abuse, drug\nexperimentation and woman ising. The\nfilm also tries to bring out his mysticism\n(which was of course very fashionable at\nthe time)\u2014the film has the idea that Jim\nthought that he always danced with a Red Indian onstage, as if the music is\nsomewhere in his 'being', in touch with\nthe universe.\nCynicism aside though, this isn'ta bad\nQuick Change\neffort. The film's strength does not really\nlie in the storyline (which seems to be\nstitched up from a lot of anecdotes about\nMorrison's life) nor the depth of the\nMorrison character, but instead in the\n'concert footage'\u2014the film is full of 'live'\nperformances, where the four actors\ncome together very well. Watching Val\nKilmer on stage in his leather pants you\ncan almost understand why Morrison was\nthe symbol of sex.\nThere's a great take-off of Andy Warhol\nand his entourage here. Poor Andy's left\nlooking like a slobbering wimp opposite\nMorrison.\nIn full, the film fails to capture the spirit\nof the man, but succeeds with the music.\nAnyone who likes The Doors' music\nprobably needs to see this film.\nI.H. Ju Dou\nBefore launching into a review of\nthis movie I feel it is only right to\ninform you that it has been on the\ndistribution lists for so long that it has\nassumed an almost mythological\nsignificance. As such, when the time\nfinally came for its release I had built up\nmy expectations to a mixture of awe and\ndespair.\nQuick Change is one of those films\nwhich is based entirely around a single\npremise - in this case, that trying to\nescape from New York is more difficult\nthan the original bank heist. In some\ncases this works admirably (Fatal ,\nAttraction et al) and in others (The\nTowering Inferno, Jaws IV etc) it has all\nthe charm of a burning penguin.\nThankfully, this film has Bill Murray in.\nMr Murray is possibly the single most\nstraight-faced comedian in the history of\nmotion pictures. He is more poker faced\nthan a poker which has lost its entire\nfamily in a tragic air crash. His delivery\nvaries from the merely deadpan to the\nsimply dead. He plays an urban planner\nwho is so distraught at the giant\ncarcinogen New York has become that he\nelects to leave for tropical climes with a million of someone else's money. To help\nhim in this aim he recruits his naive but\npersonable girlfriend, Geena Davis and\nthe loveable (but, alas, very thick) Randy\nQuaid, an old school pal.\nAfter a fairly humorous opening\nsequence (in which Murray rips off the\nbank dressed as a clown and calls up a variety of exciting devices to distract\nattention while he makes his getaway)\nthe film really breaks into its stride when\nthe unfortunate Loomis (Quaid) manages\nto foul up the whole operation with a simple arm movement (no, you'll have to\nwatch the film). After this our heroes are\nplunged into a world where the taxi\ndrivers speak only Spanish, the bus\ndrivers only accept exact change and noone will accept their cries for a kingdom\nfor a horse at all. Suspense claws with\ncomedy for top billing as Murray is forced\nto wrangle with the Mafia, elude a police\ncordon in his desperate efforts to procure\nexact change and avoid Spanish knights\njousting with bicycles and broomsticks.\nEveryone plays their part very well; the\nscript is top-notch and a few wonderful\nlines pop up now and again. A good film.\nThe Flying Gerbil\nRarely do you see a film with such\nan interesting story behind it. A Chinese production financed and\npost-produced by the Japanese, banned\nfor no obvious reasons in China, who\neven tried to su press this very first\nChinese film to be nominated for an\nOscar. The film's American distributor\neven organised a petition signed by\nWoody Allen, David Lynch, Martin\nScorsese among many other famous\nHollywood directors, actors and musicians\nurging China to lift the ban.\nAs for the story of the film, it may\nsound too traditional: Ju Dou is the name\nof the girl who is bought by Jin-Shan, the\nemployer of a dyeing workshop, as his\nthird wife. Jin-Shan has driven his two\nwives to early graves already by sexually\nabusing them. Not standing his torture, Ju\nDou seizes protection from Jin-Shan's humble nephew Tian-Qing, who works for\nhim and fancies her like crazy already,\nand becomes pregnant. A son is born,\nand the family tragedy begins. However,\ndirector Zhang Yimou has approached the\nfilm in a different angle and has thus\nretained freshness. The film's strongest\npoint is its stunning photography. Scenes\nmaking full use of the contrasting colours\nof the dyed cloths under the sun as well\nas the depressing views of the primitive\nand lifeless Chinese village won't be\neasily forgotten.\nBy the way, if the deadpan acting in\nThe Last Emperor put you off from any\nother films about the Chinese, this is the\nfilm that shows that there exists some\ngood Chinese actors.\nThere will be one more week's screening only at the ICA, by the time\nthis article is printed. This wonderful\nmelodrama is essential viewing.\nDJS. Su.\n4\n\n"

    "content": "Reagan visits IC?\nThe Spitting Image puppet of Ronald\nReagan occupied the foyer of the Union\nBuilding last Saturday for the 'To Boldly\nGo' conference against censorship. The\nconference was opened by Barbara\nEhrenreich pictured on the cover with\nher agent, Briar Silich and Ronnie.\nBarbara is an award-winning american\njournalist and author of 'The Worst Years\nof our Lives', a critical comment ry on the\nReagan years.\nAlso attending the conference were\nnineteen other speakers including\nnovelists, poets, filmmakers and a solicitor specialising in freedom of artistic\nexpression. The guests spoke on the\nvarious aspects of censorship from the\nnationwide use of secrecy as a government policy to the self-censorship\nwhich we experience in day to day life.\nThe manager of the 'Young Unknowns'\ngallery near Waterloo, Peter Sylveira,\nspoke of a piece of art containing two\nfreeze-dried foetuses obtained from St\nMary's Hospital Medical School. He was\nsuccessfully prosecuted for outraging\npublic decency and was fined \u00a3850 and\nnow has a criminal record. He\ncondemned the establishment and art\ncommunity for their failure to support\nhim and the principle of freedom of\nexpression.\nPeter Sylveira: Criminal?\nNicholas Walter, Director of the\nRationalist Press Association, talked of the\ncensorship which we impose and which is\nimposed on us from childhood onwards.\nTwo banned films, 'Dick' and 'Visions of\nEcstasy', were shown at the event. 'Dick'\nis a comic film showing the naked truth\nof man's inadequacy ie one thousand\nflaccid penis's with a commentary\nproduced soley by women. It has been\nbanned from public broadcasting by the\nITC. The second film, 'Visions of Ecstasy'\nhas been banned under the blasphemy\nlaws and cannot legally be bought, sold\nor broadcast. Michael Newman,\nconference organiser, commented that the\nshowing of the film might have been\n'slightly illegal'. A second event is being\nplanned for next year.\nThe Late Dr L Beverly Halstead, who\nspoke at the conference, was tragically\nkilled this week in a car accident.

    "content": "Gary Clail\n\u2014Emotional Hooligan LP\nDespite chart success, Gary Clail has not\nabandoned his roots; Emotional Hooligan\nis an LP of light reggae/dance (not of the\nbastardized Maxi Priest variety). Try as I may to listen to this record, however, I find my attention slipping away like a soapy eel on ice. While the songs are fine\nnothing particularly differentiates them\nfrom each other (apart from the singles\nBeef and Human Nature) and a few\ninteresting samples (a dog's bark on the\ntitle track and a small child on Magic\nPenny). The lyrics are uniformly well-intention ed but rubbish.\nPay It Ail Back Vol. 3 is a compilation\nof the On-U Sound collective's various\nindividual efforts, all of which are based\naround reggae. In some cases it's pure\nand unadulterated (You Thought I Was\nDead by Lee Perry) while in others it's danced up or soul ed out (Disconnection\nand / Think Of You by The Strange\nParcels and Little Annie respectively).\nGary Clail makes another appearance as\ndoes a track unashamedly called 'Stoned\nImmaculate'. Two cuts from The Barmy\nArmy: a busy techno effort and bizarrely,\na football crowd singing Blue Moon..\nStone\nThe Blessing\n\u2014Highway 5 LP MLSIC\nThe cover is truly one of the most\nterrible I have every seen. Why the road\ndisappears into the girl's eye and just why\nall this American road imagery of striking\nmountains, windswept plains and blue sky\nshould be on the cover of this crap song,\ngod only knows. Maybe if they were\nsome hard rockin' moth a's like ZZ Top or\nSteppenwolf then, yeah OK. But this band\nis not rockin'. It's not even swaying. It is\nvapid-soul-pop aimed at the 27-year-old\naccountant who likes to dream about\nbeing an easy rider whilst driving home\non a moped from a Network South-East\ntrain station in Kent, before getting home\nand having a cup of tea with his wife and\nher mother. Truly nightmarish.\nDominic.\nBad Manners \u2022Carnival 26.4.91\nTo go through this in order of\nappearance, the Cuckoos seem to be\ndeserving of all their press coverage, as\nthey played an impressive professional\nset. Now this poor reviewer trots all the\nway up the stairs, only to find yet\nanother band intent on rehashing the\npast. They and their tunes should be left\nto fester in their flares and their flowers.\nBack down the stairs. Jazz music. It's annoying, isn't it? The Tommy Chase\nQuartet play jazz. They don't play it\nparticularly badly, not when compared to\nSouthside's Monday night torture, but\nthey played enough to drive me upstairs\nto the cocktails. Coincidentally, upstairs is\nwhere I found Bad Manners. BJ, the ents\nchairman went to great lengths to praise\nthem in last week's Felix, and they did\nplay a set which got the crowd going. But\nI come not to praise Bad Manners, but to\nbury them. Hands up who can remember\nany Bad Manners hit apart from the Can\nCan. You can? And when was that a hit?\n1981? Exactly, when we had Bucks Fizz\nand The Nolans (in the charts). Meanwhile\nin other universities and poly's over the\ncountry a quick glance towards NME\nreveals, amongst others, dance chart-toppers N Joi, Hull's rising stars\nKingmaker, Neds' partners-in- crime Mega\nCity 4 and the innovative Shamen. Oh,\nand Julian Cope too. Now I realise that IC\nUnion building has various restrictions\nand should have been condemned years\nago, but surely we could have someone\non the up. Do you get my drift? BJ writes\nthat Bad Manners were back at IC after a two year break. Let's hope they don't have to be exhumed again.\nLise Yates\nSynergy featuring the Shamen\nSince this evening consisted of acts\nmerging seamless ly into one another we\nshall refer to the bands as A,B,C etc.\nBand A sounded crap through six\ninches of brick which may or may not\ngive an insight into their particular\nmusical forte. At this point we were still\nstruggling with an illiterate T&C bouncer.\nWe don't expect an outcry over this. We\njust want you to feel sorry for us.\nBand B( aka The Irresistible Force (we\nthink)) consisted 'of one gentlemen who\nshared a chemical passion with much of\nthe audience and another who spent most\nof his time tending to a small and\nplaintive keyboard. This peculiar\ncombination nevertheless pounded the\ncrowd into a kind of bliss ed out frenzy.\nThe Force retired amidst much repetition\nof their name (in case anyone missed it, a wise precaution) and faded into..\nUntil Band C arrived, although Band C was really Woman A and Dancers E and\nF(A,B, C,D accompanying Irresistible\nForce). MC Kinky took the mike with her\nown esoteric blend of rag ga toasting and\nGregorian chant. Reviewer X felt that she\nwasn't to his taste but Y thought it was\nquite groovy. The audience (regardless of\nopinion and oblivious to the change in\nacts) continued their dazed capering. At\nsome point there may or may not have\nbeen Guest DJ D who didn't really affect\nproceedings, unlike the eight-foot tall\nspaceman (Personality A, we kid you not)\non stilts who popped up in the crowd and\ngyrated his way from one side of the hall\nto the other, closely followed by a lady\njuggling with fluorescent bats (as in\nbaseball, not as in rodent). Never say the\nShamen don't treat their fans right.\nAfter a little more of this kind of thing\n(we are now some four hours into the\nevening) Band E arrived. By now the\n-T&C27.4.91 crowd had happily settled into automatic\ntrance mode and the fact that Band E were in fact the Shamen provoked no\nresponse at all. Well, not much, anyway.\nThe Shamen played a short but very\nlively set, composed primarily of greatest\nhits. Anyone there for the music could\njust forget it because tunes were low\npriority and rhythm as uppermost. Added\nto the massed whistles of the crowd the\nonly real way to identify songs was the\nvocals, ably provided by Shamen C and D when Shaman A was occupied with his\nbleep machine and Shaman B twanged\nhis guitar.\nAfter this point Reviewer X pleaded\nexhaustion and Reviewer Y felt roughly\nequivalent and they left the audience to\ncontinue their pharmaceutical\nextravaganza..\nStone and Anna B "

Advancing beyond\nlast year's superb Extricate LP, The Fall\nCircushead\n\u2014The Jeremy Days LP\nGreen and red press releases from this\nGerman band who describe this as\n\"Psychedelic beat music with memorable\npop melodies\". Quickly referring to\nDominic's Psychedelia article in last\nweek's Felix, 1 discover that this is the\nGerman branch of Psychedelia as it,\nluckily, has no resemblance to any of the\nbands mentioned within. Beat is easier, it\ncertainly has a great toe-tapping, finger-licking beat. Memorable pop melodies,\nwell it's nothing like Kylie, but the\nmelodies are memorable, in particular\nGive It A Name, When The Wind's Blowin' Round and the soft, subtle Room\nTo Revolution. I'd say they had more\nresemblance to Hothouse Flowers and\nThe Adventures (apart from not being\nIrish) than to Jefferson Airplane. 150,000\nGermans could easily be wrong, but in\nthis case, they're not.\nLise Yates\n8\nhave shed ded two of their number and\nare now a super tight, take no prisoners,\nthrobbing monster of a four-piece band.\nThat The Fall have one of the tightest\nrhythm sections in the land is often\noverlooked and Craig Scanlon's snaking\nguitar lines are all over the album. Mark\nE's big gob is still spouting vitriol and\nwickedly funny lyrics at every turn. 'Fall\nAdvance! Fall Advance!'.\nIdiot Joy Showland sees Mark E steaming into the Manchester 'idiot\ngroups with no shape or form, out of\ntheir heads on a quid of blow.' Hello\nthere Happy Mondays, maybe? 'From\nNew York to Skegness' croons MES on\nthe nightmare-in-hell travelogue epic\nPittsville Direkt resplendent with wired\nfemale backing vox. Edinburgh Man,\nundoubtedly the star of all stars on this\nalbum, is a slow, thoughtful tune that\ntakes one back to Bill is Dead. The War\nAgainst Intelligence has MES complaining\nabout intelligence suppression in society\nwith mumbles about haircuts and dudes.\nThe title track, with its incessant\nbacking vocals chanting 'Shiftwork,\nShiftwork', plunders on and on, almost\ndrone like, reflecting the in her ant boredom in shift work. You Haven't Found\nit Yet sees the band almost funking-out\nand I swear 1 can hear Mark Smith\nlaughing. Though not as raw and in yer\nface as their early work (Bingomasters\nBreakout anyone?) this album sees The\nFall going beyond excellence to\nsomewhere most bands only dream of.\nThe Fall are fucking cool and you're an\nidiot if you don't agree. 'Fall Advance!\nFall Advance!'\nDominic.\nWench \u2014A Tidy Sized Chunk LP\nImagine calling an all female band\nWench. This lack of taste is indicative of\ncrap u lou s dod gy metal.\nThe band pales in comparison with\nother bands of the same ilk, clich ed stylised metal riffs and generally shite\nlyrics abound. This really is a poor\nexcuse for a record\u2014don't be deceived by\nthe metal-core label there is no core\nabout it.\nBuy it if you are into insipid metal but\nbeware those with any self-respect.\nPS.

Ably supported by the\nContortions, who lay down a wicked slab\nof back beat, chance takes songs (such as\nMichael Jackson's Don't Stop till you get\nEnough) rips out the warm fleshy bits,\ndevours and then regurgitates.\nJames Chance plays saxophone like\nRoland Kirk meeting Billy Whizz.\nJames Chance has an organ that is\n100% meat (no weedy wet hammond\nvibrato here thank you ladies).\nJames Chance has a voice that could\nmake glass contaminated baby food a marketable commodity.\nJames Chance is probably dead and\nthere lies the problem.\nThe accompanying biography certainly\nreads more like an epitaph and the\nconcert (for it is a live recording) was\nplayed ten years ago and released I suspect on the strength of the new\nhappening Acid Jazz scene (and does he\nmake the current exponents look like\nTina Charles or wot!!!).\nJames Chance may (or may not be)\ndead but I have this sneaking suspicion\nthat somewhere there's a party going on\nto which Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison\nprobably aren't invited.\nDavros Crippledick.\n\n"
