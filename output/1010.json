    "content": "News\nImperial\nBY ANDY SINHARAY\nImperial College is considering\nassisting in the establishment of\na science and technology\ninstitution in Thailand.\nThough the Management\nSchool has had formal links with\nSingapore since 1987, a new\nproposal, set up by a former IC\nstudent, Dr Viphandh\nRoengpithya, is at a college-wide\nconsultation stage, seeing\nwhether it fits in with IC's objectives.\nDr Timothy Seller, Director\nof International and School's Liaison, said Thailand was\n\"rapidly developing with\nenormous potential. I think that\nthe person who has made the\nproposal is a good egg ... the idea\nis more philanthropic than\ncommercial, but obviously it\nwould have to make ends meet.\"\nThe idea has been around\nfor some time and is being\ncarefully considered. \"The\nImperial College alumni are very\nstrong, we've got some big boys\nout there [who are] very\nprestigious people.\" He added\nthat IC has already been\ninvolved with a few Thai\nuniversities, working on staff\ndevelopment projects, research\nlinks, and consulting schemes.\n\"This initiative is the latest and\nlargest ... this is the first really\nSE Asia\nconcrete proposal that has come\nforward ... It's not a pie in the\nsky idea.\"\nWhilst some members of\nstaff, including heads of\ndepartments, were interested in\nthe project, some had also\nexpressed concern that\ninvolvement with a lesser\ninstitution would lead to a drop\nin standards. \"We won't compromise our reputation,\"\nSellers said.\nMr. Peter Mee, College\nRegistrar, stressed that the\nfuture of the idea was dependant\non the level of staff support for\nthe project. \"The Rector is\nseeking as wide a reaction as\npossible [to the idea] ... but it's still being talked about. It's a question of gauging enthusiasm\", he said. As for the\naward of qualifications, it would\nnot award IC degrees as \"we\ndon't award degrees anyway ...\nand there's no suggestion of the\nUniversity of London being\ninvolved.\" The intention, he\nadded, was to set up an\ninstitution whose standards\nmirrored that of IC, but the\nwhole scheme is \"not cut and\ndried ... it could be picked up, it\ncould be dropped.\"\nThe minutes of the Board\nof Studies, which has been\nlooking into the idea, are due to\nbe published within the week.\nMrs Elaine Taylor, Administer\nin the Kobler Unit, died from\ncancer on October 16th. She joined the college in\nJanuary 1980, initially in the\nDepartment of Electrical\nEngineering and later of\nComputing. She worked for\nProfessor Robert Spence, later\nfor Professor Igor Aleksander\n(Foundation Kobler Professor of\nthe management of Information\nTechnology), subsequently\nbecame Head of Department's Secretary in Computing and\nfinally moved to the centre\nCognitive systems.\nAs Secretary to Professor\nSayers, Dean of City and Guilds\nCollege 1984-88 and 19991-93,\nshe became a great friend of the\nUnion and of its officers, and\nwas well known throughout the\ncollege. Her recent funeral in\nSalisbury was attended by a number of academic, technical,\nadministrative and general staff\nand both past and present\nstudents and Union Officers, and\nthere have been donations in her\nmemory from several groups of\nCollege staff to Imperial Cancer\nResearch - her chosen charity.\nUnleaded Chaos\nBY MICHAEL LUD LAMA Professor from Imperial\nCollege has run into a storm of\ncriticism this week for the\nevidence he gave to a Commons\nSelect Committee.\nProfessor Roger Perry, Head\nof the Centre of Environmental\nControl and Waste Management\nin the Civil Engineering\nDepartment, gave evidence at the\nTransport Select Committee. His\ndepartment is funded by Octel, a company that sells lead additives\nfor petrol. The report, released\nlast week, called for a ban on\nsuper unleaded petrol and an\nurgent inquiry into the use of\nunleaded petrol in cars not fitted\nwith catalytic converters. It\nclaimed that unleaded car fuel\nproduces much higher levels of\nbenzene than leaded.\nWhen FELIX contacted\nProfessor Perry he stated that all\nof his interests had been declared\nbefore the hearings had started.\nHe was more evasive when asked\nabout his involvement with\nOctel replying that he was, \"not\nprepared to discuss that\". He\ncontinued: \"we have a college\nwhere sixty percent of our\nincome comes from industry,\nresearch contracts and research\nprojects. Octel was one of\nthem.\" FELIX spoke to Fiona\nWeir of Friends of the Earth who\nsaid that she didn't \"think the\ntransport committee should\ngenerally use advisers linked to\ncommercial companies.\" Ms\nWeir stressed that if such links\nwere unavoidable, then they\nshould endeavour to get a balance\nof people with outside interests.\nThe chemical at the centre\nof this argument is benzene, a Class Age no toxic carcinogen. In\norder to increase the octane\nnumber, super unleaded contains\nmore benzene, and more\naromatics, which produce more\nbenzene when burnt than\nnormal leaded and unleaded\npetrol. This was deemed 'highly\nunacceptable' by Professor Perry\nHe added that the idea that super\nunleaded was a super green fuel\nwas the 'biggest con of all time'.\nIt is widely accepted that\nsuper unleaded fuel should be\nbanned. \"We have no problems\non a call for a ban on super\nunleaded\", said Fiona Weit, \"it\nmakes a lot of sense.\"\nFELIX tried to talk to\nOctel but they declined to\ncomment. Fiona Weir said, \"It is\nour view that the reason Octel is\npushing this area is not\nprimarily due to the UK debate,\nbut because of their concern to\nprotect sales of lead and lead\nadditives in developing country\nmarkets.\"\nProfessor Perry's view is\nthat lead should be eliminated\nfrom petrol and catalysts be used.\nIf FELIX0101191 "

    "content": "Feature\nthe\nfOR fl GII Featuring excerpts from\nthe soon-to-be-published\nJames's Hall Survival Guide\nBy Adrian J. Chung\nI'm not British. That in itself is\nnot surprising. The flight I took\nto get here spent many hours\nover the Atlantic Ocean. I guess\nthat qualifies me as an overseas\nstudent. That too is not sur pris ing. How does a foreigner adjust\nto the alien territory that all Brits\ntake for granted? Perhaps this\ncan be surprising. Take College\nHalls for example...\nFreshers' week was weeks\nago and the free supply of wine,\ncheese and crisps was fast running out. The financially painful\nand generally unhealthy diet of\nfast food was taking its toll. I was\nstaying in a room in a hall of residence meant to be self-catering.\nThat is, a kitchen to be shared\nwith 22 other fresher s who happened to be living on the same\nstaircase with me.\nThe typical fresher has little or no cooking experience. I was no exception. The hall\nkitchen was quite a daunting\nroom to master, let alone enter.\n\"For those with no culinary\nbackground it is easy to be put off by\nrooms fitted with appliances which\nyou are expected to use competently\nthe first time. For this reason, the\nkitchen is one of the easiest places in\nwhich to make a complete idiot of\noneself. Thefirsthurdle is to enter\nthe kitchen. Make up an excuse...\"\nIn I strode with some bread\nto toast. Luckily I timed it per-fec t ly. The kitchen was vacant.\nThe last thing I wanted to do was\nto negotiate the entire length of a floor occupied by one or more\ngroups of Europeans, discussing\nunknown pop-groups, alien\nforms of recreation, or characters\nof some obscure soap.\nIn such situations anywhere you stood made you feel\nlike you were obstructing someone from making some important\neye\npoint on a topic you knew you'd never be able to understand. I was the only one in the kitchen. I felt safe.\n\"Don't even attempt to master\nall the appliances all at once! Begin\nsmall and work your way up. Your\nfirst goal should be to successfully\nwarm up a meal...\"\nThere were two ways to do\nthis in most college hall\nkitchens: heat or nuke, the latter\nhaving the advantages of the\nbrainless approach (just set timer\nand turn on microwave) and\nusing less crockery.\nHappily the College Hall\nstarter leaflet gave reasonable\nenough directions for locating\nthe nearest major supplier of\npackaged meals - J. Sainsbury's. Unfortunately the prices of\nmicro wav able s was prohibitive.\nI'd be better off eating at the\nUnion. The variety of meals that\ncome in cans was most enlighten-ing. I bought a saucepan and a can of beans and sausage to start\noff with. Right! I'm ready to\ncook!\nMost fresher s reach this\nlevel of competence easily - after\nburning a few extra layers of\nsemi-edible lining onto their\nnewly acquired saucepans.\n\"Cooking raw food - although\nthis requires a bit more time and skill\nthe end result can be more satisfying\nand in the long run save money,\nespecially if buying foods in bulk.\"\nI wasn't prepared to make\nthe 20-minute walk twice every\nday to buy fresh raw food, so buying in bulk for an entire week\nseemed like a wise decision. The\nload of meat and frozen ve g made\nthe return journey seem a lot\nlonger than 20 minutes but I eventually managed to hobble up\nthree flights of stairs to the\nkitchen. In all fairness I should\nhave had at least one-fifth of one\nshelf of freezer space. I soon\nlearned that hall kitchens were\nanything but fair.\n\"Before setting out to buy groceries always check that you have\nspace in the fridge and freezer.\" After rearranging the entire\ncontents of the freezer I eventually fitted everything in. Few fresh-ers took the care to maximise\nutil is ation of available space. My\nThird World upbringing ensured\nthat I was expert at this.\n\"As students tend to carry out\ntheir resupply operations at similar\ntimes, any space you may find may not be there when you return. You'l need to reserve the space...\"\nPackaging - cereal boxes,\ncardboard cases for microwave\nmeals, boxes for fish fingers and\nburgers. Anything opaque and\noccupying lots of volume would\ndo. It didn't matter if they were\nempty. That space was mine and\nrightly so.\nSome students soon found\nout what I was doing when they\nmoved the boxes around. To\nmake the vacuous nature of the\ncontents less obvious I switched\nto using frozen wet FELIX. A moist package of five or more\nissues frozen in the freezer had\nthe same consistency of a frozen\nlump of meat. No one would even\nattempt to unwrap all the layers\nin the vain search for that rare\ncommodity, freezer space.\nBecoming master of the\nhall kitchen became easier with\neach passing day.

Those exceptions (eg, God, Godflesh\nand My Bloody Valentine to name some examples) are mostly\nbrushed aside by the music press for being too far up their own\nbacksides to matter. This only leads to our greatest innovators\nbeing ignored for not being a part of whatever bandwagon out\nbeloved weeklies have decided to ram down our throats.\nHowever the so-called grunge explosion has burst out of a healthy U.S. scene and blown a gaping hole in the mainstream\nworld-wide thus allowing in alternative bands. This has caused\nmore innovative music to reach the numbed minds of the chart\nfollowers - the prime examples being Nirvana and Pearl Jam,\nand this will ultimately bring forth a healthier breeding scene\nfor more overground experimentation. Could such a thing ever\narise in Britain? It is doubtful as too many bands are concerned\nwith recreating the past instead of looking to the future. Not to\nmention the British music press' preoccupation with the past\nand unhealthy disregard for what could be achieved...\nNevertheless the Beatles and Rolling Stones, who\nattained a nigh on untouchable world-wide status that will\nprobably never again be accomplished, were a good enough\nstarting point for innovation that never occurred, but they lead\nto a decline to present standards where copyists rule the\nheadline. The punk movement took music by the ear and\nproceed to make one hell of a racket. It had a wonderful effect\nin Britain, but made little impact across the pond, although it\nun doubt ably inspired the U.S underground throughout the\n1980's and resulted in the Hardcore as well as the New, and to a lesser extent, the No Wave scenes.\nAnyhow back to the present day, the majority of current\nU.S. guitar bands were influenced by such '80's forerunners as\nSonic Youth, Husker Dii, REM as well as our very own Fall,\nand bands such as Nirvana and Pavement pushed from what\nthose bands were doing to develop to the present day where\nsuch boundaries are still being explored. Moreover back on\nBritish soil our crop of 'top talent' seem to have forgotten this,\nso we have the beginnings of a stunted scene where the\nprogressive bands are left by the wayside and those lucky\nenough to be pushed (usually by 'indie' labels run by a major\nlabel eg Hi-Rise in reality Virgin to which both S*M*A*S*H and These Animal Men are signed notice who's been getting\nthe interviews recently) are forerunners of a scene created by\nthe music press for which the bands themselves should take\nlittle blame. This continual gaze into the past does nothing to\nencourage a healthy and vibrant U.K music scene.\nlast week'sword link answers\nJAB SESsioN uAE OM MMA N1AC sPEC1 A PARO pER RENA pRAYER REALLY11 jj S AF1N ALEA J~ Z1OLA Go| A| L1ENS DUP E_\nL HoE E TE TR|l S SU|SPE|C|T|010091 FELIX MM\n\n"

Of course there\nmight not be any particular reason\nand if there are that's why Billy\nCorgan heads the group.\nStill 'pisces iscariot' has more\nthan just novelty value going for it.\n'blew away' and 'girl named\nsandoz', for just two, should end up\nas treasured as 'space boy', 'rocket',\n'snail' and the rest. (7)\n'Homegrown' by dod gy is the\nsecond full-length album from a band who are always being praised\nby the nme [who? ed]. Although\nI 've never heard any of their music\nbefore this, I now know why -amazingly, they are better than\ntheir hype.\nDespite suffering from a worrying marijuana and computer-graphics obsession, which makes\nthe inside cover look more like a rave flyer, they are definitely a rock\nband. The album kicks off with the\njan gly indie-pop of 'staying out for\nthe summer' and continues into\neleven sing-a long songs (I kid you\nnot - pick any track from the album\nand I promise you'll be able to hum\nalong in harmony). If you have ever\nrapped your foot along the\nLemonheads, early Aerosmith, the\nBeatles you'll love this seventies-tinged, laid-back, lazy rock 'n' roll.\nRetro, but not out of date. (9) 0\nFELIX "

    "content": "Incoming\nQuestionnaire... CCLTs in\nThe Question?\nNews Response\nEdited this week by Owain\nBennallack, the Editor (!)\nI am sure that most of years 2 & 3\nsaw the pretty pink (for girls)\nquestionnaire on sexual\nharassment that appeared in\ncommon rooms last year. What I would like to know is why the\nquestionnaire was only for girls. I realise that, as a male student was\nexpelled last year for this reason, it\nwas a topic on many people's minds, but in this case our\nesteemed women's officer was a little misguided.\nNo one would deny that\nsexual harassment does exist and\nwomen can be especially\nvulnerable to unwanted sexual\novertures. However, it is not\nwomen in general that suffer most\nfrom sexual harassment, it is shy\npeople, those who feel they cannot\nconfront their harass er, both male\nand female. I am deliberate\ndiscounting those women who\nview any contact with men with\nextreme prejudice. After all, if you\nlook for something hard enough,\nyou will at least find an\napproximation of it.\nTo be honest, I consider the\nsexual harassment of men by\nwomen to be far worse, as women\nwill not admit that they are\ncapable of going too far, they are\nless likely to be punished for their\nactions and male victims of\nharassment have to suffer in\nsilence. Male students have no\nmen's officer to go to and their\nfriends, both male and female, are\nless likely to be supportive in these\ncircumstances. At best, male\nvictims should be flattered by the\nattention and, at worst, they are to\nconsider it a minor nuisance.\nNor do I think that sexual\nharassment of women is\nwidespread. In my experience,\nwhen women are uncommon, they\nare treated with deference, and\nwhat would forfeit any chance of a career for the sake of upsetting a woman? In my opinion, most\nmale harass ers are either\nobsessive and should be helped,\nnot punished, or they genuinely\nhave not realised that they are\nupsetting the object of their\nattentions. Before anyone reports\nsomeone for sexual harassment\nthey should at least try to tell their\nharass er to stop. You never know,\nit might work. If Imperial College\nwants to be seen to be taking a stand on this issue, why is it only\ntaking into consideration what may\neven be a minority of victims of\nharassment? In my opinion, the\nsurvey was conducted in a sexist\nmanner and was, quite frankly,\ninsulting to the whole idea of\nfeminism. If women are\ncontinually portrayed as helpless\nvictims then we will always be\ntreated as inferior or with kid\ngloves. Why should we be treated\nas second-rate members of society.\nIn the same way, why should we\nhave special treatment? Please, if\nthere is going to be any more\nsurveys of this type, can they be\nacross the board.\nAnna\nBio II\n/ thought much the same\nalthough I disagree with the\nimplication that men 'suffer' equally\nwith women. Several women I know have had problems: no men\nyet. Certainly, the only people to\nhave been desperate enough to\never hassle me have been male. But\nyour last comment is spot on. The\n'victim' mentality seems to ghetto is e many minorities and thus\ncompounds the problem. What\ndoes everyone else think? Anyone\nfancy writing an article?\nThorny Matter\nDear Felix,\nWe would like to comment on\nthe article on the front cover of\nFelix 1009, reporting on the RSM\nFreshers' Dinner. Two points in the\narticle in particular attracted our\nattention; first, the reference to last\nyear's accident in Evelyn Gardens,\nwhich was tactless and\nunnecessary, and second, the\nallegations of 'widespread spiking\nof drinks'.\nLast year, as a result of the\naccident, the ICU president and\nCCU Presidents had several\nmeetings with the Deputy Rector,\nas the college were concerned\nabout 'institutional is ed drinking' at\nImperial.. A set of guidelines were\nagreed on, which included\nadvertising guidelines and conduct\nat events. The Presidents agreed\nthat spiking of drinks would be\noutlawed at dinners, so that every\nperson would be aware of exactly\nwhat they were drinking. At ALL\nFreshers' Dinners, the hosts made\nsure that the guidelines were\nfollowed, and anyone was free to\nstop alcohol consumption at any\npoint they wished to. There was\ncertainly not 'widespread spiking\nof drinks' at the RSM dinner. This\nhas been confirmed by the C& GCU\nPresident, the Mary's President,\nand the RCSU Vice-President who\nwere present at the dinner. The\narticle put the RSMU in a very bad\nlight, and may well cause\nrepercussions with College.\nWe all fully support the\nguidelines agreed by our\npredecessors, and will continue to\nmake sure that they are adhered\nto at events in the future.\nCharlie Bell\nRCSU President\nFiona Grandison\nC& GCU President\nVinod Fernandez\nRSMU President\nI have to disagree with your\nstatement that the reference to last\nyears article was 'tactless and\nunnecessary'. News articles should\nattempt to contextual is e the subject\nand the comment was discrete ly placed at the bottom of the article.\nIf the article has put the RSMU in a bad light then that is unfortunate\nbut we must report the news as it\ncomes to us. I personally support\nyour stance on drink-spiking and\ntrust you will continue to make\nevery attempt to prevent it in the\nfuture.\nFundamental\nMistakes\nDear Felix,\nUpon reading \"Fundamental\nDifferences\" by David Cohen, I felt\nit was appropriate for the Islamic\nSociety to comment about the\ncontents of the article. I want to\naddress two issues implied by the\npiece, namely the labelling of\n'muslim activists' and in particular\nHizb ut Tahrir as prop a gators of\nracist ideas and indirectly linking\nImperial College Islamic Society\nwith the named muslim\norganisation (\nI have deliberately\nnot discussed the other concerns\nraised in the article, for the sake of\nbrevity).\nIt is clear that the author is not\nwell versed in Islam, for it is\nuntenable for any muslim\norganisation to propagate racism,\nas such an attitude is in clear\ncontradiction to the teachings of\nIslam.\nAllah (the Lord and only God\nworthy of worship) says in His final\nrevelation to mankind, the Quran\n\"O Mankind! Indeed, we have\ncreated you male and female, and\nhave made you nations and tribes\nthat you may know one another.\nIndeed, the noblest of you in the\nsight of Allah, is the best in\nconduct. Verily, Allah is the all-knowing the all-[...]\"\n[Chapter 49 Verse 1 3]\nIslam can never be accused of\nracism, as Allah clearly states the\nonly criteria by which one person is\nbetter than another is by virtue of\ntheir belief in Allah and good\nactions. It may be surprising to\nnote that during our 'Take a Look\nat Islam' week at the beginning of\nterm, our guest speakers included\nan english speaker, two afro-caribbean speakers and a french\nspeaker.\nMy second point is to clarify\nthat the Islamic Society has no\naffiliation and nor is it a front for\nHizb ut Tahrir. Both the Islamic\nSociety and Hizb ut Tahrir consists\nof muslims, the bond in faith\nimplies that we join and propagate\nwhatever Islam deems to be good\nand therefore beneficial to society\nat large.\nFinally, \"Fundamental\nDifferences\", did not attempt to\nexplain what and why are there\nfundamental differences between\nIslam and other ways of life, rather\nit attempted to paint a negative of\n'muslim activist' and Islam in\ngeneral. The Islamic Society has\nalways been open to questions,\ndialogue and even debate\nconcerning all aspects of life.\nHowever no-one can tolerate\nunfounded accusations.\nYours sincerely,\nJunaid Sheikh\nIslamic Society Vice President\nThank you for the feedback\nJunaid. To be brief, the article itself\ndid not accuse anyone of racism: it\nreported that ULU have, however,\npassed a motion banning literature\nwhich breaks its constitution and\nthat the Hizb ut Tahrir literature, in\ntheir opinion, does. The FELIX\nauthor's opinion and knowledge of\nIslam shouldn't be relevant. Your\nphotocopy of your letter you\nsubmitted chopped off some text so\nI have had to include '[\u2022\u2022\u2022]' rather\nthan misquote the Quran.\nLetters may be commented on\nby a guest editor whose\nopinions are not nec cesar i ly those of the editor and cut due\nto space restrictions.\nDeadline: Monday 6.00pm. FELIX TfH\n\n"

As\nwe enter, an amplified flute breathes and sails\nmagically over the PA; a good start. There are\nseats up in the circle but it's standing only\ndown here in the stalls. The tangle of lighting\ngantries and drum kits on the stage is almost\nhidden by an opaque screen.

    "content": "Euxm\nThe Student Newspaper of Imperial College NolOlO 04NOV94 Boat House Blues\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nA multi-million pound\ndevelopment project has been\nplanned at the Imperial College\nBoat House.\nThe Putney based\ndevelopment will provide\nimproved training facilities and\nchanging rooms, a larger area for\nthe storage of the boats of\nImperial College Boat Club, a workshop and a small hall of\nresidence for students of IC.\nThe project has been given\nsupport by the College\nGoverning Body and an appeal\nfor funding to college Alumni,\npast rowers and industry is\nplanned for the near future. The\nlaunch of the appeal is being\nheld back until planning\npermission for the new building\nis received.\nThere has been a strong\nsuggestion that the project will\nbe receiving money from the\nHarlington Trust. The Trust has\n2.5 million pounds that is held\nin a fund for students use. The\nmoney was originally raised\nfrom the extraction of gravel\nfrom the Harlington Sports\nField.\nEach year the Trustees are\nallowed to approve the spending\nof up to \u00a350,000 on student\nbased projects. For grants higher\nthan \u00a350,000, a proposal must\nreceive approval from the\nGoverning Body before any\nmoney can be released. Figures\nin the region of half a million\npounds have been suggested to\nthe Governing Body.\nHowever, it has been\nreported that College authorities\nare only willing to approve up to\n\u00a3350,000. They hope that money\nfor the venture will not need to\ncome out of the Harlington\nTrust Fund at all. Peter Mee,\nCollege Registrar, told FELIX\nthat the College was, \"Providing\nthe support, in principle...to\npersuade people that this is a potentially successful venture.\"\nLucy Chothia, Imperial\nCollege Union (ICU) President\nand one of the Harlington\ntrustees, is enthusiastic about\nthe Union's decision to support\nthe Boat Club plans. Speaking\nto FELIX she said: \"The Boat\nClub do so well, they won\nbronze at the Commonwealth\nGames last year.\"\nThe decision to redevelop\nthe boat house was made 'many\nyears ago' according to Bill\nMason, College Waterman. He\ntold FELIX that the new facilities\nwere desperately needed, one of\nthe reasons being a 'big increase\nin women's rowing'. The current\nwomen's training area has been\ndubbed 'barbaric' by a member\nof the Governing Body.\nTrouble may arise from the\nPutney Society, a conservation\ngroup that recognise the\nimportance of an aesthetically\npleasing landscape. College\nauthorities currently need to\nconvince the society that the\nnew building will not look out of\nplace with it's surroundings. It is\nhoped that the building work\nwill start in May next year.\nMr Mason will be taking\nsabbatical leave in the new year\nfor 6 months following his\nappointment as Head Coach for\nthe Great Britain Women's Squad. He stressed that although\nhe would not be at the club\nwhen the appeal for funding was\nbeing launched he was\n'definitely not leaving' as the\nclub was 'his life'.\nDavid Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, spoke on Wednesday\nat a meeting of Conservative Students, writes Rachel Walters. He talked in\nbleak terms of the un hopeful short-term prospects for Northern Ireland, saying,\n\"the peace process is essentially bogus.\" Despite saying that there were 'causes\nfor optimism' he spoke of the crucial period next Easter by when the IRA is\nsaid to expect major concessions from the British government.

The organisers have taken\nthe 'everybody' pretty seriously, and\nare certainly trying to include people\nwho don't actually like Shakespeare.\nThere is a talk on Shakespeare's language buried among the workshops,\nexhibitions and free foyer events. But\nmostly there's no need to grapple with\nwhat for many people will be the\nbiggest turn-off: the text. Even the\nplays to be performed during the\nfestival - five acclaimed productions\nfrom abroad - will, with one exception,\nbe performed in foreign translations,\nwith sur titles. Instead, the interactive sessions\nare based freely on Shakespearian\ncharacters and plots. The trouble is\nthat to get to them you first have to\ninteract with the Barbican Centre,\nwhich is in the process of renumbering\nall its floors. Hence the stalls floor is\nnow known as 'level -1, formerly level\n3'. You'd think there'd been an\nearthquake.\nWhile the workshops are mainly\nfor children and teens, anyone even\nremotely Shakespeare-literate will\nWe asked a random selection of IC students if they'd ever been to a Shakespeare play,\nwhether they could quote any of his lines, and if they thought that nowadays Shakespeare\nshould give way to more contemporary writers.\nPat Watson, Biochem\nPG, has seen Macbeth\ntwice, \"probably because\nI'm Scottish\". Her quote\nwas \"Friends, Romans,\ncountrymen, lend me\nyour ears,\" and she feels\nthat Shakespeare is \"still\ninteresting from a literary\nand historical point of\n\u2022view\".\nMarc Strieker from Chem Eng is planning\nto see his first Shakespeare\nplay, A Midsummer\nNight's Dream, with\nArtsoc soon. He gave us\n\"Is this a dagger I see\nbefore me?\", and he\nbelieves \"we should keep\nup a little culture to stop\ndegeneration - look at all\nthe McDonald's and\nthrow-away products \".\nMohit Jain from Biochem\nIII has seen Macbeth.\nJulius Ceasar and Prospero's Books (\"a bit too\nway out\"), and his quote\nwas (altogether now) \"To\nbe or not to be, that is the\nquestion.\" \"There are so\nmany other good plays,\" he\nfeels, \"such as Death of a Salesman, which would\nbetter acknowledge today's atmosphere.\"\nIlias Avdos, from\ni Chem Eng III, came up\nwith a quote from\nRomeo and Juliet,\nhaving been to see it on a school trip. \"It was OK,\n1 #\ndH feh. a bit S0\nPPy; I could have\n, done with a bit more\nMdk '; action!

Actors improvise on Shakespearian\nsuggestions from the audience in scenes\nveering (as this sort of thing does) between\nthe dire and the inspired. Lots of thees and\nthous, and a few props including a skull for\nthe obligatory 'Alas poor Yorick' rip-off.\nIt's events like these that reveal the\nwider importance of Shakespeare today; not\nas a great writer but as part of our culture.\nWhen a corpulent (male) actor says \"I'm up\nthe duff, Romeo!\", it has an extra dimension\nof humour because it's subverting a serious,\nestablished tradition we're all aware of. (And\nfor an example of how this can work the other\nway, think of how many advertisers have\ninvoked Shakespeare to add the impression of\nquality and depth to their products.)\nThis is something which a display in\none of the Barbican foyers acknowledges\nwhen it says, \"If Shakespeare hadn't existed, it\nwould have been necessary to invent him.\"\nWhich, indeed, is exactly what some people\nclaim did happen. Sir Francis Bacon? Queen\nElizabeth I? The latest computer-aided\nresearch has turned up a surprising new\ncandidate for the authorship of Shakespeare's plays: find out who on level 0 at the Barbican\nCentre, until November 27th.

Dozens of\ncomputer programmes enable you to do\nthings like produce music from Shakespearian instruments, cast a Puckish spell,\ndesign an Elizabethan newspaper and make\nup a poster for the play. (We try this one: out\nof the corner of my eye I see an enormous\nShakespeare rampaging out of control across\ntintin's screen.) Unfortunately there's no\nfacility for printing out your handiwork.\nMechanicals, rude and otherwise, can\nput together a miniature stage set, twang a dulcimer and conjure sound effects from an\nexotic selection of percussion instruments.\nWe soothe our furrow'd brows with surf\nnoises from an Amazonian rain-stick.\nThe part children seemed to be\nenjoying most was a curtain maze-cum-forest\nwhich they could rush in and out of dressed\nin green capes.

Unfortunately I was\nunable to make it on the 20th.I asked a friend what I missed. \"Well, the speaker took\nhis clothes off and gave away \u00a350.\" After a more detailed enquiry I discovered he had\nstripped to the waist.\nBeing somewhat disbelieving I further\ninvestigated the situation. I checked with several other eye-witnesses, and was left with the\noption of believing them or finding some reason for not doing so. For example was there\nany reason for them not to tell the truth? But\nwhy did the speaker take his clothes off?\nWhat was the catch with the fifty quid?\nApparently none.\nI later discovered the analogy for which\nthe situation served. The speaker was giving a talk about an extraordinary event with consequences of vast importance. This other event\nhas far more evidence than Thursday night\ncould afford. There were eye-witnesses over a period of forty days and at one time was witnessed by more than five hundred people at\nthe same time. However it occurred nearly\n2000 years ago. But the evidence is still overwhelming as it is so well documented.\n\"Both the authenticity and the general\nintegrity of the books Of the new testament\nmay be regarded as finally established\" (quote\nfrom Sir. Frederic Kenyon, a leading scholar\nin this area.)\nSir William Ramsay is regarded as one of\nthe greatest archaeologists ever to have lived.\nHe observed the accuracy of the historical\ndetails of the writings of Luke and concluded\n\"Luke is a historian of the first rank... This\nauthor should be placed along with the greatest of historians.\"\nNelson Glueck, a renowned arch a eo lo gist, made the remarkable statement \"It may\nbe stated categorically that no archaeological\ndiscovery has ever controverted a biblical ref-e rence.\" But what is this event that happened?\nThat a man rose from the dead. And not any\nman, but Jesus. But who is Jesus? A prophet?\nA great moral teacher? God? C.S. Lewis put it\nlike this:\n\"A man who was merely a man and said\nthe sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic - on a level with a man who says he is\na poached egg - or else he would be the Devil\nof Hell. You must make your choice. Either\nthis man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse... but let us not\ncome up with any patronising nonsense about\nhis being a great human teacher. He has not\nleft that open to us. He did not intend to.\"\nBut doesn't science and scripture con-fl ict? The most apparent conflict stems from\nmaking the Bible say things it really does not\nsay and from \"sci ent ism\"a philosophic interpretation of facts. These interpretations are\ndistinct from the facts themselves. There is\nno such thing as total objectivity in science or\nin anything else due to the presuppositions\npeople always make. There is no fundamental\nconflict between science and scripture. In fact\nscience backs up scripture, but more often\nscience gives us the know-how, but can not\ngive us the know-why. The Bible does not\npurport to tell us the how of many things, but\nit clearly gives us the why's. So why did the speaker give fifty quid\naway at Christian Union on Thursday? To\nillustrate a point. No one was willing to\nbelieve that it was true, due to being so\nremarkable. But God has offered us something far greater and of more value, with no\ncatch. It was an expensive point to make, but\nthen God's offer also cost him dearly. All we\nhave to do is accept it. It is the offer of a new\nbeginning, living life to the full the way God\nplanned it. On Thursday, November 10th, come and hear a talk on \"Life, the universe\nand everything\" given by Gareth Williams, in\nroom 308, Huxley, at 6pm to find out more\nabout the answer to these why's.

    "content": "THE menu Standby\ncreative urges and limbs\nWe've had a lot of recreated\ngou lies recently. Bram Stoker's Dracula was crucified into a postmodern love-blood story by the\nhamming talents of Francis Ford\nCoppola, Jack Nicholson lost the\nthread of werewolves in the truly\nhorrible Wolf and now we have\nMary Shelly' s Frankenstein, courtesy of Kenneth Branagh.\nAs with Coppola's Dracula the\ninvocation of the original author's name in the film's title is always\ncause for concern. To the general\npublic it suggests that the book has\nbeen accurately translated to film\nand whilst Mary Shelly's Frankenstein is broadly true to the\noriginal, Branagh can not resist the\ntemptation to throw in a totally\nsuperfluous end scene which comes\nclose to wrecking the whole film\nand certainly does inflict a great\ninjury to the central ideal of the\noriginal. Branagh might say that he\nwanted to use Victor Frankenstein's love to Elizabeth as a balancing\nforce to passion for his work but in\nthe novel that patently isn't the\ncase.\nThe film starts and ends on the\nice-floes of the North Pole with the\ndiscovery of the raving Dr\nFrankenstein. Before dying he\nrecounts his terrible story\naccompanied by the chilling howls\nof the creature he has created. You\nknow the bare bones of the rest.\nThe construction and animation of\na creature, sown together using the\nraw materials of death and the\nnewly discovered magick of\nelectricity. \"It lives\" is the glorious\ncry which marks the fulfilment of\nFrankenstein's alchemist ical search.\nAnd amidst the boiling flasks and\ncopper tubing Branagh's portrayal\nof Victor Frankenstein carries us on\nin the breathless imperative of\nresults without responsibility.\nFor the creature, as played by\nRobert De Ni'ro, the fact that \"it\nlives\" is the two pronged problem.\nWhen someone says 'Did you think\nit would thank for giving it this\nlife?', Frankenstein can only gape.\nIn the pivotal scene the creature\nquestions Frankenstein in the\nwastes of an ice cave. When he\nasks \"what am I?\", you know it's something we' ve all failed to\nanswer. As for the depth of, \"do I have a soul?\", like Frankenstein\nmost of us wouldn't even attempt\nthe question. For all its scars, gore\nand raging murder it's the creature\nwhich is off eYed to us as a conscience.\nIndeed if there is a villain, it's Victor Frankenstein himself. He's not so much driven by his\nunh allowed goal as defined by it.\nHe throws all away, including his\nlove for Elizabeth, to recreate life.\nThe point, however, is made too\nforcefully, particularly in the end\nscene of total madness which twists\nthe idea of the companion\npromised to the creature, into\nunnatural life in more ways than\none. For all of Branagh's talk of\nlove, his Frankenstein becomes\ninsane, to the point of inhumanity,\nand there's little there of love.\nAgainst the power of Dr\nFrankenstein, Helena BonhamCarter's Elizabeth can only be\nsubmissive.

    "content": "News and Editorial\nCore Universities\nBY ANDREW SMITH\nA five university core within the\nRussell Group of eighteen elite\ninstitutions has been revealed\nthis week.\nSir Ronald Oxburgh, Rector\nof Imperial College, has admitted\nto FELIX that the ViceChancellors of the original Group\nof five universities, Imperial,\nOxford, Cambridge, UCL and\nWarwick, do still 'occasionally'\nmeet.\nSpeaking to FELIX, the\nRector scoffed at continuing\nrumours that an Ivy League of\nBritish Universities is being\nplanned.\nEarlier this week, at the\nsecond meeting of the 'Aldwych\nGroup' (student representatives\nof the universities invited to the\nRussell Group) some members\nhave questioned whether an Ivy\nLeague was 'morally acceptable'.\nIn contrast, Eric Forth MP,\na Junior Government Education\nMinister, speaking this week at aNU S/ULU student question\ntime, said that he had no\nproblem which such a League.\nHe continued by saying that it\nwould-be 'difficult to prevent'\nand suggested that an unofficial\none currently exists.\nAlso discussed was top-up\nfees with Mr Forth insisting that\nthey are not being considered by\nthe Government. However, the\nRector has said that he is not\nopposed to the 'basic principle'\nof the fees. Admitting that they\nare 'highly undesirable', Sir\nRonald has said that the College\nmight be forced to consider top-up fees if it came to 'preserving\nCollege'. He sought to dampen\nimmediate fears of such a move\nby insisting that he does not see\nfees as a possibility at present.\nThe Rector would not\nconfirm whether any unofficial\ndiscussions of top-up fees at\neither the Russell Group or the\nGroup of Five have taken place.\nHe stressed that fees had not\nbeen an 'agenda item'.\nSOAS Clampdown\nBY THE NEWS TEAM\nAfter last week'sULU decision\nto ban all literature of the\nIslamic group Hizb ut-Tahrir,\nthere has been a further incident\nat the School of Oriental and\nAfrican Studies (SOAS).\nLast Thursday at a meeting\nof the '1924 Committee' (SOAS's Muslim Society) Faisal\nMuhammad, Chairman of the\nSociety and member of Hizb ut-Tahrir, paid tribute to the\nsuicide bomber from the Hamas\nIslamic resistance movement,\nwhose attack on a bus in TelAviv on 19th October killed 22\npeople. As a consequence the\nSOAS Management Committee\nreleased a statement on Monday\nevening stating that \"no Speaker\nrepresenting the views of Hizb\nut-Tahrir, whether from within\nor outside the University, is\npermitted at future meetings of\nthe 1924 Committee\". The\nSOAS student body were not\nconsulted about the ban and\nconvened a general meeting\nyesterday to discuss the Union's policy on the issue. There was no\ndecision reached as FELIX went to press. Rumours that the\nManagement Committee's decision will be revoked on the\ngrounds that it is a breach of the\nright to the freedom of speech,\nhave been leaked to FELIX.\nThis follows another\nincident which occurred at\nKing's College. On Wednesday\n26th October, a meeting of the\nso-called 'Culture Society' was\nplanned. Following fears that\nthere would be trouble if the\nmeeting was allowed to\ncommence, the Student's Union\ndecided to cancel the meeting for\nthat day. Despite this decision\nthe organisers attempted to\nrest age the meeting. A statement\nby King's College Student\nUnion said that \"the disturbing\natmosphere of the meeting led to\nthe decision to call the Police\".\nAround 45 police officers were\ninvolved in assisting King's College authorities to disperse\nthe meeting. The fears of\npossible disruption were\nreportedly due to the official\nmeeting that the King's Jewish\nStudent Society was holding at\nthe same time. King's sources\nclaim members of the 'Culture\nSociety' had threatened to attend\nand create a disruption. The\nJewish Society's meeting was\ncurtailed and the members were\nescorted, protected by the Police,\noff the premises .\ne Ji for i aL Laser Trauma and Computer\nCentre Kindness\nWelcome to the last bastion of\nthe Luddite in the Cyberaged\nTechnozone of IC (see s files for\ndetails). This week the laser\nprinter decided to add its own\nartistic embellishments as it\nprinted. Its style was abstract -big black smears down the\ncentre, presumably symbolic of\nits snail-trail progression through\nunending roads of pages.\nAnyway, I 'll have no truck with\nanything post-Impressionist so\nits days were numbered. None of\nour usual experts knew how to fix\nit but the Computer Centre said\nthey would try and so off it went.\nBut wait! No laser, no paper!\nNo paper, no FELIX!

The idea is at least\na year old but the writers in\nquestion have finally torn\nthemselves away from the\ncountries they love to sojourn in\nanother land. I thought the gig\nreview worked better. Is there\nsomething inherently primal and\ntherefore globally acquirable\nabout pop? The opera review\nsometimes seems to have its\ntongue too much in its cheek to\navoid betraying its lack of\nknowledge. Does the greater\ndepth of opera indicate a higher\nart form or just an art with an\nelaborate set of entry codes? At a gig, as Patrick saw, you are\nliterally carried away.\nLoose Limbs\nHaving been accused of\ncomplacency by some after\ncomments against police-bashing\nI made a few weeks ago I'd like to\nredress the balance by pointing\nout the latest idiocy to come from\nthe Criminally unjustifiable Bill.\nAlthough not directly related, the\nIndependent today carried an\narticle concerning the revised\nrole of the Special Branch in\nRusky-free and IRA-less Britain.\nThey are to redirect their\nsurveillance efforts towards\nprotesters, activists and 'public\ndisorder'. I won't even bother\nshouting 'Police State'. Just: if\nthat is what they are going to do\nwith the spies then what are they\ngoing to do with army? Use them\nin the public arena too?

In the age of the office-at-home,\nwhen we can access the world from our living room, we're going to value shared experience more than ever.\nCybersociety is gone to stay, for in the virtual world you're on your own.\ntit Credits: Gditore\nHilary \u00b0 Iconaid \u2022 (la tasha \u00b0 Pictures\u2022 IHatt Blach \u00b0 Hypeaid c Dap farsi de,.:r;;;>,'>, \u2022< i'H; ii'=rr\\#WJ?fi';iK.^r;i'^..: i:..K.! \u2022;;.<'::\n!.!\u2022\u2022..: .. ii \u2022\u2022' \u2022\n! i':;.,).(!Ci ii \u2022\n!:.\u2022'.--:'<\n..I.' \u2022 : ' : \" : ! !\n\u2022\n(\n\u2022\n< .\" \u2022 !\n\u2022\n. : . . !

Some of them still feel like\nwearing a shoe box with the shoes still in it, though. I had a go\nwith the Dataglove, which enables you to pick up virtual\nobjects while in SSimmersive DR. I 've also worn a data suit that was really, really embarrassing because it was made of\ntight lycra.\nDo you think that UR will be as big as karaoke one day?\nYes. It's not as portable as karaoke, although there are people\nworking on portable UR. But I do think that UR will become\nmore widespread through entertainment.\nWhat did you think of Lawnmower Man?\nI thought it sucked big. The graphics were crap and it gave a very misconceived view of the capabilities of technology.\nThere's an idea that UR sprang from the same people that were\ninto mind-altering drugs in the 60's, and I get the impression\nthat Steven King played on that in the story. I don't think\nyou can expand your mind by being subjected to UR.\nWill completely SSimmersive UR one day mean a convincing alternative universe?\nYes, in the future. Considering they haven't invented a decent\ntactile feedback or olfactory technology yet, I think it'll be a long time before we even approach alternative reality.\nRl William Gibson Non geek Canadian author of genre breaking novel fascinated tech i.* odr'\\: tr ti \u00ab\nfh rou i!.p3 Ivan Sutherland sr ng le handedly created the field of human centred inter-!ii.:. \u2022\n:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 ! : . ;\np3......'a search for better cinema rather than better simulation:') \u2022-, com-q nau gq FELIX HQ "
