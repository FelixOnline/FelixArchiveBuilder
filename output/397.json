    "content": "MU X Arts Reviews\nLooking back on\n\" Take Spin nh V This is the 5th album from Weather\nReport \u2014 one of the top light jazz\ngroups whose popularity over the last\nfew years has increased with the release\nof a couple of funky, less extreme, LP's. They are jointly led by Joe Za win ui, an\nassorted keyboards and synthesisers, and\nWayne Shorter on saxophone, two members\nof the modern jazz hier arch v who have\nplayed with likes of Miles Davis and\nHerbie Hancock. More than able support\nis provided by Dom Urn Romao (percussion)\nAlphonso Johnson (bass), and Ishmuel\nWilbum (drums).\nThe album expands the current trend\nInto the funkier, more rn v th mic ally orientated regions of jazz that were first\nattempted on \"Sweetnighter\" and then\nadopted for the major part of \"Mysterious\nTraveller\", their 3rd and 4th albums\nrespectively A good decision \u2014 considering the first two albums dispensed with the\nidea of a main theme and concentrated,\nrather excessively, on the creation of\nmood and atmosphere as the substance of\na number. They were creating sound\neffects with nothing to bring them together\nexcept for the occasional moments when\nAlphonze Mouzon's excellent drumming\ntook charge and provided a direction. Now they've sorted all that out \u2014\nconcentrating on strong, melodic, tunes\nwith a discernible progression from start\nto finish. You don't have to poses s a Phd\nin music to understand it anymore .\n\"Man In a green shirt\", the opening\ntrack, is the best example, with insistent\ndrumming and equally powerful bass\nattempting to move the song faster than\nit wants to go but constantly having to\nBy Hie\ngive in to the s teng th of the melody\nline. An excellent number whose feel is\ncontinued through the rest of side one and\npart of side two of s pe ical note are Dom\nUrn Romao's contributions, constantly\nadding colour and fullness to the sound.\nIn short, the album shows a more\norganised, uncluttered approach to Music, than Weather report's free-form leanings\nof a few years ago. More control has been\nimposed on \"the sparks of Imagination that\nused to wander off and \"Tale Splnnio\" is\nan excellent reason for listening to this\nband of undeniable stature and Integrity\nwho are at last finding an a if d len ce of\nsome magnitude.\n..JethroTull's\" A Passion Play\"\nCritics write glibly about the past-and-present classics of music whilst sometimes missing out the real gems under\ntheir noses . Almost all of them uniformly,\ncondemned this album as a technique-for-techniques-sake loser. Few praises were\naired and Jethro Full, until then a highly\nacclaimed and respected group were\nbluntly handed their cards . Hatchet jobs\ngalore \u2014 but they were all wrong.\nThis is a truly classic album. It\nrounds off the whole progression of Tull from the 1968 Blues roots of \"This Was\",\nthrough that fine trio of waxing s \"Stand\nUp\", \"Benefit\", and \"Aqualung\", the\nretrospective dou b\\e \"Living In the past\",\nand then, consciously leaving the singles\njingles behind, \"Thick as a brick\" \u2014 a well-constructed and interesting slice of\nIan Anderson's talent which was popular\nflexing s of musical muscle and adventure\nthat were to be presented in more depth\nand complexity on \"A Passion Play\" .\nIt's not an album you can put on and\ninstantly like . As with all the best things\nan initial lack of understanding has to be\novercome by actually \" listening\" to the\nthing. The music is not for the casual ear but any trouble taken in sticking with\nthe piece through repeated playing s is\nsoon rewarded in full. The genius and\nclass, initially hidden away by overlays\nof faultless musicianship and the control\nof the eccentric one-legged piper, is then\nallowed to show itself. What at first may\nhave sounded mechanical and contrived \u2014\nHerbie Mann meets EL P \u2014 eventually\nallows the main themes to come out of the\nundergrowth, and the textural strengths of\nthe music have a chance to prove their\nworth . It's all finely-boned. craftsman I ike\nmusic making. Varied expeditions on\nclarinet, saxophone, and flute, complementary piano-work by John Evan, and\nmetro no mic pre c is on playing from\nBarriemore Bar l our and Jeffrey HammondHammond combine to produce this\nexceptional album. It didn't sell in millions\nbut much good music is hidden away,\nignored by the masses, while the rubbish\nreceives the bright-lights treatment .Now,\nlet's hear it folks for show addy w addy! at the time and is now regarded by many\nas the band's best work before degenerating\ninto the self-indulgent extravagance of\n\"A Passion Play\". In fact it is the\nculmination that these albums were all leading up to. \"Thick as a brick\" was\nthe trial run in full-length music over two\nsides of vy ny l and incorporated the first\nConcerts\nDaryl Hall and John Oats/Amazing\nBlondel\nNew Victoria Theatre\nMuch to my misfortune, Amazing\nBlondel seem to be the supporting act to\ntoo many of the concerts I attend. After\nmuch person el suffering I 've found the\nbest policy to take when Blondel trundle\nonto a stage, is to make straight for the\nnearest source of refreshment (usually the\nbar). However, having been despatched\nby the Editor to review the entire proceedings tor FELIX, I took my life Into my\nown hands and somehow managed to s it through the whole set .After alI, I thought,\nthe dynamic duo had been augmented by\na bass-player and drummer, perhaps this\nwould liven up their usually tiresome\nofferings, and maybe - just maybe, they\nhad written a song that didn't have to be\ncounted in with the proverbial ... a one-a two-e one-two-three-four!\nI was wrong on both counts.\n'We've got two guys up here with us\ntonight who ha v 'nt played in a place this\nsize before', the man said, 'one's an\nundertaker and the other is a bricklayer'-(after hearing them I had no reason to\ndispute this).' OK, this Is a song that we\ndon't know (sic), it goes something like\nthis - a one, a two-a one-two-three-four'.\nAnd so it went on, every number-a one a two \u00bb . * - - \u2022 for about the last half dozen\nsongs, the band suffering the acute\nem barre s ment of having the time counted\nin for them by a great percentage of the\naudience. It would seem that I'm not the only\none to have seen Amazing Blondel on\nprevious occasions, as the size of the\naudience quickly tripled on their departure, to await the arrival of Daryl Hall and\nJohn Oates for their first appearence on\na British stage. The Americans on gwr ltl ng duo, who by all accounts are about to\nbreak it big in the States, flew in for a one-off gig to promote their new RCA album, simply called 'Daryl Hall and\nJohn Oates'. Although not too widely\nknown in this country as yet, it was\nevident from the reception they received\nthat with the release of two albums on\nAtlantic( 'Abandon Luncheonette' and\n'War Babies'*) they have built up a considerable reputation.\nWhilst Blondel took band l ty to Its\nextreme, Hall and Oates (together with\ntheir four-piece band) showed the finer\npoints of slick American profesional is m. For the uninitiated, the music is tight\nand well arranged, placing the emphasis\non strong lyrical and melodic content, a pleasant change from the endless'boogie\nsyndrome\" that too many of their US\ncounterparts exhibit. A good example\nwould to liken them to say, Steely Dan, although this might be unfair in so much\nas the duo's music is as Individual to\nthem as is Becker and Fagens to the\nDan's. Most of the vocalizing was done by\nHall, who also played electric piano and\nthe occasional mandolin, Oates taking the\nslightly lesser role of rhythm guitar/\nharmony vocals, although on his few\noutings singing the lead he handled the\nsituation more than competently.. The\nband too, did nothing but enhance the\nperformance with their fine musicianship and on-stage mannerisms, and It was\nquite fitting that they were brought back\nfor two encores. With their new single ' Camellia', being\ngiven quite a few radio plays, (although\nfar too good to make our tepid charts) the\nname of Hall and Oates should spread a a little further, and in so doing, perhaps\nentice the duo to return for further UK gigs .\nIf they choose to do, then they should not\nbe missed at any cost.

Tha FIstrclEgisal\niDEr Mig glass\nARIES(22 Mar21 Apr): Arians have no difficulty in falling in\nlove .More often they go for physical attractiveness. They always\nbelieve it's the real thing! Their ardent, impatient and impulsive\nnature can lead to fast and many affairs .Swinging parties, discos and entertainment places are usually their scene . A love affair\nwith an Arian could be quite adventurous and passionate!!\nTAURUS(21 Apr21 May): Taureans are both passionate and\npractical. They are very careful on the first few dates and will hardly disclose any emotions until the time Is right. Once in love\nthey are often devoted and willing to do just about anything (oh\nyes!) to keep their loved one content .Owing to their posse sive nature they demand loyalty .\nGEMINI (22May \u201421 Jun): They usually enjoy versatility in their love affairs. Anything boring is out!. Their charming, lively and\nwitty nature attracts many members of the opposite sex . They are\nhardly shy and can have several romances running at the same\ntime. In fact they just can't help winning hearts. Remember Don\nJuan was a Gemini . And so was lady Casonova .\nCANCER(23 Jun \u201423Jul); Under their apparently hard exterior\nthey are really shy and emotional. They hardly make the first\nmove to start an affair, Instead they wait for you. Because they\nare subject to changing moods the affair may go through many\nphases. Nonetheless, they are sensitive, romantic though often\nlack passion.\nLEO(24 Jul23 Aug): Loves mage stic ally. Generous both with\ngifts and affection. Easily flattered. Has no restriction about\nstarting an affair anywhere, anytime. Physical attraction Is very\nimportant to them. They dislike to be criticized or ignored in any\nway by their loved-one. They are passionate and posse sive. And guess who was a Leo? Napolean Bonaparte .\nVIRGO(24 Aug23 Sep); Their practical, prudent and patient\nnature is reflected in their love life.They dorf t wear their hearts\non their sleeves. If they fall in love, they initially conceal their\nfeelings in case of rebuff. Small gifts are highly treasured and\nwords of affection remembered. Rather than chasing nebulous\ndreams, they'd look for a needle in a hay-stack (and probably\nfind it too!)\nLIBRA(23 Sep230 ct): Their attractive outlook and harmonious nature are more than enough to spark an affair. However,\nthey'd rather stay friends for a time before any involvement .They're\noften indecisive and need to weigh the pros and cons of just\nabout everything . They are charmed by unusual people and like to\nhave some interest in common.\nSCORPIO(240 ct22 Nov): This is the most emotional and\npassionate sign in love. Their magnetic personality and hypnotic\neyes capture many hearts. Their love is penetrating and sensuous\nprovided it's genuine. They are loyal to their partner. Owing to\ntheir posse sive nature they can be jealous and suspicious. James\nBond and Grace Kelly are typical Scorpios.\nSAGITTARIUS(23 Nov22 Dec): Sagittarians are usually too\nindependent to fall in love deeply. They like to be on the move\nand enjoy a romance (or two) in the background as long as it\ndoesn't tie them. Their affections are often easily captured but\nwhen the initial heat cools they loose interest. They are loved\nby many and tend to love many.\nCAPRICORN(23 Dec20 Jan): Their shy nature usually makes\nthem calculating in love affairs. They are highly aware of the\nopposite sex. Once in love they will use any strategy to capture\nthe loved one. They don't require a common interest but prefer a contrast. They get out of em barra sing situations by their in cong rous sense of humour. They are the most loyal of all the signs. AQUARIUS(21 Jan\u201419Feb); Their charming, sensitive and\nidealistic nature is reflected in their love life. They usually have\na good humour and are very generous. If they feel they're going to\nbe bored in any way they just move away. They often look for a common interest. Their sudden and wild enthusiasm could lead to\nadventurous affairs. PISCES(20 Feb21 Mar): Their tender hearts are readily\ncaptured. Gentle and sensitive nature may lead to emotional\nuntidiness in their love affairs. They are impressionable and\neasily flattered. They enjoy glamour. Not only romantic and\naffectionate but also passionate. They can be easily hurt. Often\nvery generous. Sometimes tend to be forgetful. Liza Minelli is a typical Pisces( glamour?!)\nCOPY DEADLINE\nIS MONDAY 13TH AT 2.00PM "

    "content": "FELIX II\nSPANISH CA VING\nby John Miller\nThe caving club is again very active. This summer\nit mounted its first expedition for three years,visiting\na remote area high up in the western end of the\nCantabrian Mountains in north Spain.\nThe expedition was in the field for six weeks,\nduring which we discovered and surveyed three\nkilometers of cave passage. We had to go up to 1000 m above sea level to find our most exciting discovery.\nCueva De Wueva, as we later christened it, even had\nits' own human skull at the bottom of a39m entrance\npitch .'Not a sign of human habitation we thought, but\nperhaps someone murdered in the Spanish Civil War,\nas we had already found in the entrance of another\ncave an old machine gun. We eventually discovered two\nkilometers of passage in this cave, some of it\n30m high, our exploration through was ended by a sump, where the water reached the roof .\nIf you want to find out more about caving and the\nexcitement we shared this summer you should join us\non one of our weekend meets. Our next meet is the\nweekend of October 17th19 th and is in Derbyshire.\nOur notice bao rd is just inside the entrance to the\nUnion if you wish to sign up and come along.'\nFor the first time in a number\nof years the Table Tennis Club Is competing in a league . The\ninitial matches began in the\nfirst week of term, and the\nteams met with mixed fortune.\nLack of practise was evident\nin the performances of both\nteams, however with many\nkeen new members it is hoped\nthat competition for a place in\nthe team will improve the\nstandard.\nThe Second team lost\nheavily to NC B IV 7 - 2 with\nboth Steve and Paul winning\none game . The First' s avenged\nthis defeat somewhat, with a hard fought 5\u20144 win against\nNC B III though this was due\nmainly to K. winning all three\nof his games.\nThis year the club has\nmany new members and more\nwould be welcome. The club room is on the third floor of the\nUnion at the East end and is\nopen at all times. The club\nruns a' ladder' and Knockout\ntournaments and it is hoped\nthat many friendly matches\nagainst other colleges will be\narranged. I Will be in the club room most Wednesday afternoons,\nso come a long and join. CROSSCOUNTRY London Transport's hopeless inefficiency caused a slight\nhiccup at the start of our new season, we missed the train.\nRallying our spirits, and hoping the race would not start without\nus, we caught the next scheduled train, which incidentally\nstops at more stations than the tube to Ongar.\nTo the race. It was the\nfirst UL trial, Including a mob\nmatch with Blackheath Harriers\nat Hayes In Kent. The course\nwas a telling one, including a\" devastation hill\" of over a mile in length and 500 feet\nhigh. One did not exactly see\nexhausted runners strewn\nalong the wayside, but it was\nenough to show that a little\nmore training might be in\norder before out next match.\nThe lack of immunity to\nnettle beds only slightly spoilt what was a very enjoyable course. Rob All in son led UL home to finish fifth in\n29mins53 secs, third for UL was Ian Ellis in fourteenth\nposition. Andy Davey ran a good race to finish four\nminutes ahead of Mike Welford\ngaining himself the chance to\nbuy V* of a jug. Dave Jones, re covering from illness, ran a fine race finishing a good 2'/2\nminutes up on John Shearer.\nUL again managed to lose\nto Blackheath by 461 to 612\npoints which was not surprising\nconsidering they had only 2\nrunners in the first 13 places .\nThe post-race search for\nreal ale ended in failure so the\nteam dispersed ending an enjoyable n rst t ix ture. The club notice board is in\nthe Union by the cloakroom, if\nanyone is Interested in running\nfor us, each race will be\nadvertised there.\nTABLE TENNIS\nby Trevor Walker\nHOCKEY by Jim Marshal Capt. Ist team\nand Dave Balderston Capt 2nd team\nThe season's exertions began on Saturday, bringing varied\nresults for the three teams involved .Due to Wednesday^ inclement\nweather the trials were cancelled, so the strength of the teams\nwas uncertain.\nThe Ist XI played Richmond It's who g ava the college a stiff\nstart to the season, defeating them 2\u20141 . The team played quite\nwell considering that this was their first game as a team and\nthat four members had never played on a grass pitch before. An early goal by Richmond, before\nthe defence had settled down\nwas equalise d by a fine\nindividual effort from Trevor\n(Superstar) Tutu just before\nhalf time. IC started the second\nhalf well, when Jim Latter hit\nthe post with a good shot,\nhowever our unfit side were\nsoon gasping and Richmond\nscored the winning goal in the\nlast ten minutes. Despite the\ndefeat this performance was encouraging for the rest of the\nseason. Team:- C Brown, J Cook, J Marshall, M Lawless, I Hodges,\nR Orlcan, J Latter, Afridi, T Tutu, Fatanla, S Lee.\nAn experimental 2nd team\nfaced strong opposition at\nOsterley to lose 8 \u2014 2 . In the\nf is rt half a single goal by Bob Middleton challenged the home\nteams three goal lead but then\nlack of fitness began to take\nits toll . IC conceded five more\ngoals In the second half before\nR Middleton sc or co ills and the\nColleges second goal; a fine\nin divi du a I effort.\nTeam:- R Hutson, Callun, Vaz,\nK Holden, Magney, D Balderstone, Isles, N Bell, D Middleton, Gold ing .\nThe 3rd team showed great\npromise with a fine 3\u20140 win ov or Mertcn. Bruno speed\nscored all three goals and\nthereby qualified himself to\nbuy a jug. Team:- Mackay, D Carlisle,\nBarett, Tan, Charlton, P Newell, C Parker (Capt), B Speed.

    "content": "Reviews continued\nCONCERTS Greenslade In The Great Hall\nA large appreciative crowd attended'\nth js, the first IC Ents gig of the session. Greenslade were the main attraction with\nP hill lp Good hand Tait as support.\nHe entertained the audience with a medley of songs on piano and harmonium.\nAfter a quick pint In the Union Bar( during the interval) I came back to hear\nGreenslade. They are a band with a fine\nmusical pedigree, including former\nmembers of Coll is eum and King Crimson, they somehow failed to live up to\nexpectations. Although technically\nimmaculate, they didn't really play with\nany great conviction. They came on stage proceeded by the\ninevitable pre-recorded tapes and were\nstraight into 'Gatalan' from their last\nalbum 'Time and Tide'. It failed miserably as a single but was given a good\nread it ion on this occasion. The next time wh ci h sounded like an\nLP recording \u2014 as did most of their other\nsongs \u2014 was called 'Sun of Spirit' which will be featured on their forth coming\nalbum. They then slipped back into time,\nand for the rest of the concert played\ntracks from their previous four albums. Of note were the times from their\nsecond album 'Bedside Manners Are\nExtra'. These included 'The Ass's Ear',\n'Spirit of the Dance' (which they played\nfor an encore) and 'Drumfolk'. The latter\nbeing a rather poor take-off of Billy Cobham's style of drumming.\nThus ended the first gig at IC and all Un all must be considered a success. I 'look forward to many more.\nTheatre\nLook Back In Anger\nPandora Theatre is a new company,\nformed by old members of IC Dramatic\nSociety. In their first production, which\ncan be seen tonight and tomorrow in the\nUnion Concert Hall, they give us a powerful rendition of John Osborne's modern classic \"Look Back in Anger\",\ndirected by Richard King. Jimmy Porter has bec ime a legend In\nhis own lifetime as the original aog ry man. Mark Frank holds our attention as\nhe brilliantly balances his humour,\nseeking the sympathy of the audience,\nagainst the Imperative tyranny over\nhis mls fortunate wife, Alison, Beneath\nthese public faces lies a sense of concern\nfor Alison and tor Cliff, caught in the\nno-man's land between, which may at\ntimes seem too credible. Penny Grove\nplays Alison with the remarkable restraint\nwhich the part requires; more than once I felt Impelled to stand up and silence Jimmy's haranguing but her quiet fore-bear ance quelled me. Only at the end did she break through and scream the house\ndown, unfortunately becoming unintelligible In the process.\nPerhaps the character the audience\nfinds most hateful Is Helena (Frances\nBrinton), the archetypal Cool busybody\nwho stands up to Jimmy, though not for\nlong. She is the catalyst without whom\nthe play could not fire and Miss Brlnton's cold blooded approach is frightening:\nDenys Bennett plays Cliff with an\nair of long experience, he has seen It all happen so many times. His control at the\nnews that Alison Is pregnant Is Impressive.\nHe Is the datum line from which the\nviolence of the others may be measured.\nEric Stove It's brief appearance as Alison' s father shows an elderly man,\nnot equipped for the situation in which\nhe finds himself. His actions are studied\nand correct.\n' Look Back In Anger* has been dated\nby the renaissance which It began. Once\nOsborne had opened the floodgates by\nrevealing, <o the theatre - going middle\nclasses, what post war youth was really\nup to there was no stopping the tide of\nthe -kitchen sink. Today it is difficult to\nimagine how shocked the audiences of\ntwenty years ago must have been, but\nnobody can go to the concert hall this\nweek without having their emotions roused\nby a very forceful production.\nRIZ b ft READ\nFreshers' Fair by Riz Shakir, ICU DP\nA large number of fresher s attended the fair, hence from my\npersonal point of view the fair was quite successful. However,\none or two things which emerged from it warrant some comment.\nFirstly a considerable number of clubs and societies did not\nbother to fill in and return their forms, but turned up on the day\nand expected everything to be laid on for them. I tried to accommodate them as best as I could, at the risk of it playing havoc\nwith the index which had to be altered as late as one o' clock on\nTuesday morning.\nI would plead with the new officials to put in their forms\nbefore the end of the summer term, so that next year the DP does\nnot have to scrap his plans and start again just because twenty or\nso clubs have decided to ask for stand at the last moment.\nI am aware that their was a shortage of tables, however .there\nseems no easy solution to this since we cannot borrow enough\ntables from the rest of college and to buy tables for use on one\nday in a year is hardly practical. I am looking into the possibility of renting tables and will forward my findings to my successor. One distressing thing on the Freshers Fair was the fact that a considerable number of clubs and societies completely ignored my\ninstructions and put up posters with tape. The fact of the matter\nis that over \u00a33000 of both College and Union money has been\nspent on re decoration of the building this summer. My view may\nseem somewhat harsh, but I think a small minority of irresponsible\nclub officials should not be allowed to destroy the outlook for the\nrest of students. I am therefore taking the matter to Council and\nthe offenders will be appropriately penal is ed.I would like to make it clear to everybody wishing to put up\nposters in the Union Building that they should either be put up on\nthe notice boards or Blue tac should be used. Any club, society,\nor individual in breach of this would be penal is ed. The form of\nthis will be considered by Council. At this point I think I owe all of you an apology for having\nmade an ill-prepared and mis representative statement in my haste\n(over the PA system) during the Fair. I would like to stress that I feel strongly about clubs and\nsocieties granting free membership to fresher s for the first few\nweeks of the session. I will be taking my proposal to Council and try to get policy on this stating that clubs/ societies must not\ncharge freshmen any subscription until a few weeks into term.\nThis will enable the fresher s to get acquainted with the facilities that the club provides and/or the types of functions it organises.\nIn this way a more active membership should result and make\nsure that the hierarchy of the club/society cater for all Interests\nand are not holding the position just to obtain pri vili ges. Finally, I would like to encourage clubs/ societies to hold more\nfunctions and every student at IC to participate in the Union to a greater extent. The Union not only needs you for It to be strong\nand representative, but it provides you with a variety of facilities to help you in your everyday life.\nENJOY200% OF LIFE WITH\nTRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATION SOC.

In\nbright sunshine, amid cheers\nand shouting, IC's invasion of\nOxford Street, better known as\nthe Tlddy-Wlnks race, began.\nThe Miners, including the IF\ncontingent, arrived late (It\nwas their bar-night the previous\nevening)to taunts of' you're late'\nfrom the already present RCS and Guilds. The race was started by the\npresident of IC Union, Peter\nTeague, who was promptly\nfollowed by the hordes of IC.\nMeanwhile, intrepid mechanics\nwere attempting (rather\nsuccessfully) to bring Bo\" and\nJez alive for the event.

    "content": "Peter Patter Welcome to another Peter Patter, I hope that you have all settled down to the\nterm, and involved yourselves In the\nsocial scene, as well as the work that\nyour Department will have been giving\nyou. A sufficient variety of events to\ncater for most tastes, seems to have been\nprovided this past week .\nThe week has been somewhat marred\nby the mysterious illness that John Downs\ncontracted, and is now believed to be\nGerman Measles . I am sure that you would'\nwant to join me in wishing John a speedy\nreturn to health. The Union Office does .\nnot seem half as bright without him.\nRefectories formed the major part of\nthe business at the first U GM of the\nterm as was reported in last week's FELIX. There have been several developments since then. At the Refectory\nCommittee meeting that afternoon it was\ndecided that Dr Levy, Mr Mooney, and I have to obtain quotes from a number of\nfirms for a variety of different types of\nby Peter Teague, ICU President\nInquiries Into the Refectories. Mr Mooney\nand. I also have to get together and review\nthe Formal Dinner Price List, as it\nappears that this may be far from correct\nfa functions organised by College a Union Clubs and Societies . This revision\nshould mean that the prices came down by\n10%. May I publicly thank the other\nStudent Representatives on the Committee\nwho put their cases most eloquently.\nMany students, particularly first\nyears, have asked me how much the\nCollege Calendar costs to produce, and\nhow much It Is used by the students who each receive a copy. This could perhaps\nbe one small area In which the College could make savings In the years to come. Any ideas that you have fa alternatives\nwill be most welcome. The threatened shortage of accommodation fa students seems to have evap a a ted. We ran the usual start of term ' Crash Pad' in the Union Gym fa people with nowhere\nto live and on the fullest night we only\nhad seven people staying there. I hope\nthis means that everyone else has\nfound a satisfactory place to live. If you\nare having problems with your Land lad, or want to apply to have a fair rent fixed\nfa your flat, then details, advice, and\napplication fam s are available In the\nUnion Office. A good accommodation\nadvice service is needed within the\nCollege, and John Downs and I have\nbeen making a concerted eff at to collect\nall the in fam atl on that we can. We will be only too pleased to pass It on to\nanyone who is Interested. Your local\nCitizens Advice Bureau should also be\nable to help with any accommodation\nproblems.\nTo close this Peter Patter I would just\nlike to remind you that the Nomination\nPapers faa whole host of Interesting\nposts are up on the notice board In the\nunion Lower Lounge, so why not pop over\nand see If any of the jobs take your\nfancy.

President caught\nwinking!\nLast Saturday morning, Mr Peter Teague,( of no fixed address), President\nof IC Union was caught single-handedly\nWINKING in Oxford Street, W1. When\napproached, Mr Teague (who carried on\nwinking) was heard to say, 'I 've always\ndone it, and I think that more people at\nIC should participate'. When asked why\nhe was doing it, he said, 'For those blind\npeople, less fortunate than myself, who\nthrough no fault of their own cannot wink\nany longer'.\nMr Teague was taken to Bow Street\npolice station where he was charged with\nwinking on the Queen's highway under\nsection 41.\nIn a written statement, he asked for\n221 other offences to be taken into\nconsideration. These included one of\norganising a vendetta against one grease\nmerchant and wholesale distributor of\ncock c roaches who wished to remain\nanonymous, but whose family motto is\n\"Overchargeand under cook\". Later, Mr Keith Ahlers, the President\nof City and Guilds Union, and himself a born win ker, joined Mr Teague and together\nthey proceeded to wink down Regent\nStreet, causing much havoc and a mess on\nthe pavement.\nFor full details and sensational photos see\ncentre pages\nDowns out\nJohn Downs, IC Union\nHonorary Secretary, was discharged from the sick-bay\nlast Tuesday.

So there I was stranded on a building site\nwith only a pick axe, pre uma tlc drill, and a fine selection of\nwe lI tanned brick ies as company.\nMy work mates proved to be\nreally kind and exceptionally\nwell behaved. On the ether\nhand, the accommodation was\ndefinitely rough.\nAfter three weeks of pure\nsweat, a very apologetic\nadministrator arrived at the\ncamp.

    "content": "8 FELIX Interview with Charles Clarke\nNUS President\nCharles Clark, President of NUS, had a classical\neducation with a difference. He attended a Public School,\nand then went on to Cambridge University. In his first year\nhe became actively involved in the aftermath of the Garden\nHouse demonstration, which led to the arrest of seven\nstudents in February 1970. In his second year, he was\nelected to the Executive of the Cambridge Students Unionthe first Executive body at this University. In his third\nyear he was elected as President of the CSU and was\ngranted a sabbatical year.\nThe following is an extract of a conversation he had with\nFELIX just before the beginning of the new term.\nFELIX: What are your own political opinions?\nCharles Clark: Iam a member of the Labour Party. I describe\nmyself as being on the Left-wing of the party; I think that the\nmain economic problems that the country faces will not be solved by cutting public expenditure, wage control, and other methods\nthat this government is employing.\nFELIX: What measures do you think are necessary?\nCharles Clark: Measures that will decrease unemployment; first,\nthat people have the spending power in their pockets to buy\nproducts and thus stimulate production, and secondly an increase\nin public expenditure. So far as inflation is concerned, I would\nargue for much stricter price controls, enforceable by statute.\nThis may reduce profitability in certain areas, and no doubt\ncertain people who own capital may decide to transfer it to\nmore profitable areas. South Africa, for example, and areas of the\nwor Id where the Labour Movement is not at a11 strong. Measures\nbanning export of capital are, therefore, equally requisite.\nFELIX: Would you confiscate this capital?\nCharles Clark: Indeed, yes. FELIX: Do you accept that the \"economic crisis\" is with us?\nCharles Clark: I certainly accept that.\nFEU X: But in \"NUS is Your Union\" you say that students are\nnot responsible for the crisis?\nCharles Clark: I don't think that students have created it, nor\nworkers.\nFELIX: But, surely, it does not matter who created it, it is here\nto stay?\nCharles Clark: It does matter. If you look for means of dealing\nwith the crisis, you have equally to look at how the crisis came\nabout. Now, I think that the reason that the economic crisis came\nto exist, especially in this country, was through lack of invest-ment. The people who control the capital decided that they would\nnot invest in this country. They took their investments elsewhere,\nto more profitable areas, and for that they must bear a substantial\nportion of the blame. We cannot and could not control those\ndecisions.,, \u201e\nFELIX: Are you in favour of total pul ic ownership?\nCharles Clark: No; we should take into public ownership, and\nthus into public control, the key industries \u2014 those which control\nour society .\nFELIX: It often appears that some public Corportions are\ninefficient monoliths that char up vast sums of money?\nCharles Clark: That is patently false; there are two specific factors which must be taken into account. The first is that the\npublic corporations have been saddled with a massive debt\nrepayment \u2014 almost the sole cause of debt balances in many\ncases \u2014and second, those industries which have been nationalised\nare Public Service industries, and as such, public service has\ncome before the economic need of making a profit.\nFELIX: How much money does NUS spend on its international\ncampaigns?\nCharles Clark: 1 5%, of NUS resources - about \u00a34,500. This is\nspent on the four areas on which we have policies; South Africa, Vietnam, Chile, and Fascism in southern Europe (Greece and\nformerly, Portugal.) The policy is now partly out of date, but I think that the majority of students would support it. FELIX: How and why are these policies formulated?\nCharles Clark: The NUS takes up certain policies because they\nare prioritized by Student Unions wishing to see certain questions\ndebated openly.\nFELIX: Aren't f he se issues remote trom students?\nCharles Clark: No, they are n't.I think that British people, and\nthe British social system, because Britain was once a world\nempire, are specifically involved in these areas. FELIX: Does the Broad Left impose a\" parry line\" on its\nsupporters?\nCharles Clark: We are not a political party, and we cannot,\ntherefore, impose a line on members. It is not a\" democratic centralist\" organisation in that sense. Hopefully, we all come to ac once nc us on matters.\nFELIX: Many people at NUS Conference have observed that NUS\nExec members refuse to answer questions on which there is no\nparty line?\nCharles Clark: So far as I know every Executive member when\nasked a question, has answered it frankly.\nFELIX: What does NUS think about the increase in tees for\noverseas students?\nCharles Clark: Very bad indeed, as we said to the Government\nimmediately. We are not well enough involved in the whole\nquestion of overseas students, and this makes things difficult.\nTrevor Phillips has been doing an excellent job in this field, but\nthe movement must be developed so that pressure of that kind\nfrom the government can be resisted. My view of the way that the government should treat overseas\nstudents is this: that it should be prepared to accept overseas\nstudents to colleges in this country at all levels, and should\nnegotiate with each foreign country an understanding as to the\nbasis for exchanging students.\nStudent Unions in foreign countries take precisely the same\nattitude as we do towards overseas students; West Germany and\nFrance are cases in point.\nFELIX: What changes would you like to see in the present grants\nsystem?\nCharles Clark: I would like to see full grants for all students\nover the age of sixteen. FELIX: What is the NUS case against \"loan \u2014 grants\"?\nCharles Clark: Firstly, it would discriminate against those from\npoorer backgrounds; secondly, when you are working after your\neducation, you are mortgaged to a degree; thirdly, it would\ndiscriminate against women. The most important argument, how-ever, is that education should be a right for all people; we\nwould tike to encourage everyone to go into further education,\nand obviously less people are going to take it up if they will be\nfinancially discriminated against.\nFEU X: What are the new tactics in this years grants campaign?\nCharles Clark: I don't think that there is any virtue in novelty.\nThe main strategy is to work with the trade unions and wider\npublic who are fighting the cuts in public expenditure.\nFELIX: Why does the NUS favour comprehensive education?\nCharles Clark: Because the graded system of education perpetrates\neducational priv il age to the disadvantage of many. For instance,\nthe binary system of higher education set up a class system \u2014\nuniversities versus the rest, which means, basically, that the\nUniversities will get a better deal than the rest.\nFEU X: Does the NUS think that students should attend their\nlocal Universities as a method of solving the accommodation\nproblem?\nCharles Clark: No. The higher education system is and should be\na national one. The NUS seeks to defend and represent students\" interests\nnationally and locally.Sometimes it fails, sometimes it succeeds,\nbut student involvement, firstly in local unions, and secondly\nin NUS is the only way that we can ensure (a) that we represent\nour members adequately and (b) not just represent them on paper,\nbut actually campaign for the fulfillment of their views. I hope\nStudents at Imperial College will do this. FELIX: What role do you see the student press having to play\nin student a flairs? Charles Clark: The student press has an important role to play -it must transmit to the individual student HONESTLY what the\nviews of his Union are, what the policies of NUS are. and what\nthe major debates within it are. Unfortunately, there has been aten dancy for some student newspapers to trivial is e these matters,\nand for the papers to become the extensions of the editor'sego. FELIX: Charles C lark, thank you for talking to us.\nCharles Clark: My pleasure.\nUonal College of Science Bnion\nUNDERWATER UMBRELLA COMPANY RAG STUNT MEET R CSU OFFICE1030 amSAT11 th OCT( Tomorrow!)\nBring Umbrellas, goggles, we,t suits etc. Share Certificates Issued for Donations\n\n"
