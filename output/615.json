    "content": "concerned, perhaps the answer at present lies in\nHead Tenancies where no great capital outlay is\ninvolved. This year Michael Arthur has picked up the\nodd property with one or two major properties in the\npipeline at present. Michael also has a more ambitious project for a student village. I would\nadvise my successor to follow this idea as it has\ngreat potential.\nDon Mon ro is retiring as Senior Warden and\ndeserves the Union's thanks for the work he has\ndone, even if we don't like his style of doing it.\nWelfare\nWhilst half on the subject of Student Services, all\nwelfare matters seem to have been handled in\nPrinces Gardens. I have had very few welfare problems across my desk this year. I have also had\nno complaints about Student Services so I assume\nthey have successfully handled all welfare problems. Thanks to Michael and to Sue Telling.\nIn the wider sense, the Union has been active in\nthe welfare field. Nick Pyne( with a little help from\nme) succeeded in getting the installation of security\nbolts in Southside. This was a major step forward in\nthe prevention of rape and possibly theft. Nick also\norganised Welare Week. Well organised and badly\nattended, his efforts were wasted on IC students. I hope our Welfare Committee can produce a welfare\nbooklet this year which will be another step forward.\nThe Health Centre is under financial pressure and\nmethods of maintaining all facilities are being examined. There have been no complaints to me\nabout the Health Centre, a pleasant change from\nfour or five years ago. Credit must go to the\nDirector, Dr Haines I regret he is moving on to new\npastures.\nMorton's Mystery\nI thought I would put this in here to check how many people really read the whole report. There is a scheme of major importance to the Union under\ndiscussion in College. It may come to light during\nmy term of office or it may be left to next year's executive.\nBars\nI have really enjoyed my job as Bar Committee\nChairman this year.\nWith a decline in the drinks industry nationwide,\nCollege bars have held up very well. This is partly\ndue to sensible policy on prices including an\nOctober discount and to the guest ale scheme. I hope t jie se policies will continue.\nSuccess has also been due to changes in\nindividual bars.\nOver the summer, Barney, the barmen and I discussed the possible changes to the Union Lower\nLounge. All of us set to different aspects of the\nchanges and we ended up with a partition, a new\ncarpet, hand pumps and decent beer. All proved\nsuccessful and the bar has been open for most of\nthe year. The much maligned partition, \" McCabe' Folly\", has greatly improved the atmosphere of the\ndrinking area.\nBigger changes came in Southside. Brewery loans were obtained and a great deal of re decoration was carried out. I believe Southside should be a real\nshowpiece bar by the end of the year. The surroundings will be very pleasant when all the work\nis complete and pictures obtained (and thereby\nhangs a tale!). Add to this good quality beer, bar\nsnacks, pleasant barmen and occasional entertainment and the bar should really do well.\nMy thanks to Roy and the rest of the Bar Committee. Also to everybody else who offered\nsuggestions for improvements (both big and small)\nin the bars. Finally my thanks to the barmen but\nespecially Dirty Harry In Southside. His list of\nsuggestions was virtually endless and his enthusiasm to implement them was( normally) equally infinite.\nRefectories\nThe Union started the year with a survey. This\nInvolved a vast amount of work but all was probably\nworthwhile. The results were both useful and used.\nA new range of sandwiches and salads was put in\nthe Buttery. The feedback, including written compliments in the suggestions and complaints\nbox, was all good about the new range.\nThe survey also threw up (!) the fact that simple\nmatters like the cooking of vegetables in Southside\nand the S her field main refectory were being mishandled. These complaints were all followed up\nby Mr Mooney and should have led to improve-ment s. Finally, the survey brought to light many complaints about the catering in Linstead. Mark\nGillette and the rest of Linstead Hall Committee\nfollowed these up. A cessation of catering in the Hall\nis possible but was not wanted by the majority of\nresidents. Instead Mark has negotiated a number of\nchanges in the service, including a cafeteria style\nservice on trial this term.\nThe Southside Refectory was moved down a floor\nover Easter. This idea came from the Refectory\nCommittee Chairman and was largely to save money. Saving money is important as it will be\nreflected in the prices. ICU hopes that the move will\nalso improve quality by putting the outlet nearer the\nkitchens.\nThe Union Refectory has lost a lot of customers\nsince I first came to College. Gone are the days\nwhen there is a queue around three walls of the\nroom. There are big changes under consideration at\npresent. The proposal is to close the lower refectory\nand use the Lower Lounge as a catering outlet. The\nstyle of service will change, probably towards awy ie bar type service. I think these changes will greatly\nimprove catering in the Union.\nIf these changes take place, taking over the Lower\nRefectory becomes an irrelevant issue. However, I did say I would investigate this matter in my\nmanifesto last year. I have spoken to a number of\nUnion Presidents in other colleges about their\ncatering. I have also seen catering accounts prepared by other universities. Some of the losses\nare spectacular! P WP visited a couple of viable\noutlets in London but on balance I think it would be\na financial disaster to attempt a takeover. Besides,\nthe College probably would not allow it.\nFinally, the Union should thank Dr Schroter for his\nwork as Refectory Committee Chairman over the\nlast three years. I believe he has always worked with\nthe interests of the consumer at heart, he is acutely\naware of the social role of catering in this College and he has always been keen to co-operate with the\nUnion. Thanks Bob.\nUGMs and Council Meetings\nAt the time of writing, six out of eight UG Ms have\nbeen quo rate at one stage. This is an improvement\nand I don't care why that is; if we need to discuss\nRag Mags every meeting then that's fine by me. The\nimportant point is to get people to meetings so they\ncan see what the Union is all about.\nUG Ms have often been fun but rarely has a meeting given me an idea to chase up. Indeed, the\nonly mandate I recall from a motion was to check up\non our Chancellor's behaviour in Nepal.\nSimilarly Council has given me little to do but\nCouncil meetings have had the added drawback of\nlack of interest by its members. Two Council meetings to date have ended in quo rate. Still, they\nhave been fun at times and it has often been amusing to observe political backstabbing from\nsome members.\nRag\nOh dear! I would have liked to be able to report the\nexecutive took an active part in promoting collections. Regretably my involvement has only\nbeen to negotiate with civil servants at Scotland\nYard and with various financial b of fins over accounts and licences.\nRon y ne Mac Donkey and his committee have\nworked very hard to salvage something from the\nmess and I hope we will see Rag back on a sound\nfooting next year.\nFELIX\nIn general FELIX has been lively but has once or\ntwice slipped into sensationalism. However, I know\nMark presents stories the way he feels students wish\nto read them. Mark's editorials have generally been\nwelcomed as constructive criticism and only once\ndid I feel he was being unfair. One regret about\nFELIX was that the layout was exactly the same as\nthe year before and this may lead people to look\nback on Mark's year as an extension of his predecessor's. Mark Smith deserves the Union's thanks. He has\nworked hard at what is arguably the hardest\nsabbatical job. I hope it hasn't worn him down too\nmuch! Personnel\nIt has been a pleasure to add JoH ewa nick a to our\nstaff. She has proved to be tolerant and charming\nand has many admirers.\nOther personnel matters have involved negotiating wage rises for our staff and keeping them\nhappy! Fortunately, this has not been too difficult.\nLast summer I was involved with a long series of\nwarden ship interviews. These generally proved interesting and I think the right people were appointed. However, because of personal involvement I cannot claim to have actually enjoyed\nmost selection procedures.\nBarney McCabe\nOne of the most newsworthy events of the year was\nBarney' s resignation from the post of Deputy President. This decision was precipitated by a no\nconfidence vote at Council. However, there was\nmuch more behind the decision than just a few\nhacks getting upset. The decision was only Barney's.I think the job had ceased to entertain him\nand this made him lazy. Barney felt very strongly\nthat ICU should be more fun and entertainment.\nPerhaps he was right but there will always be boring\naspects to the DP's job, it cannot all be fun. Barney\nwas not very good at the boring bits and left one or\ntwo interesting tangles over finance, etc., because\nhe had not taken the time and care with the boring\nbits. Barney's love of entertainment occasionally\nmade him fun around the officer but at other times his\nplaying of banjos, etc., was bloody irritating.\nStill he was an occasional source of novel ideas\nand always loyal to me, Marco and the Union and for\nthat, at least, I thank him.\nI must report on three aspects of his job which I have been involved with either before or after his\nresignation.\nFinance and Clubs and Societies\nWe have spent a lot of money this year. Last year's officers left us a healthy balance and we have made\ngreat inroads into this. This has been a pleasure as it\nhas been almost entirely due to new activities within\nclubs and societies or completely new clubs. I have\nsaid it before but involvement within clubs and\nsocieties is possibly the most important part of ICU. With the other officers of the Union, I prepared the\nestimates for next year's budget. The problems all\ncome on the income rather than the expenditure\nwhere sub-committee chairmen and C CU Presidents showed great restraint. At the time of writing, I am not sure how much the College will allocate us\nso the extent of the problems is undetermined.\nWe have consolidated the five year plans and we\nhave a very clear picture of where equipment expenditure is going over the next few years.\nShop\nOver the summer, Barney and I independently came\nup with the idea of a Union Shop. After talks and\nfurther thoughts it was decided to go into a joint\nventure in the Southside Shop with the refectories.\nEstates did the conversion quickly and all was ready\nfor the start of term.\nTeething problems arose from our end in the reordering of stock and the promotion of sports\ngoods. It was very disappointing that the students\nwere unaware that we were selling some of the\ncheapest goods in London. However, the shop will still make a trading profit\nthis year and with some work from successive DPs should make a realistic annual return on the initial\ninvestment.\nCertainly the appearance of the shop has improved and the refectories have benefited from\nthe joint venture.\nGames Machines\nThere were a number of reasons why the Union lost\nmoney this year on our vending operation. Barney's biggest mistake was that he did not actually realise\nthis was happening.\nHowever, it won't happen again. Christine Teller\nand I have negotiated a deal with a different\ncompany on which it is virtually impossible for us to\nlose out.\nBureaucracy and Fiddly Bits\nI have spent a vast amount of time dealing with\nenquiries and problems from students and many\nother people. These come in the form of telephone\ncalls, letters or personal visits. It was inevitable that I would spend a lot of time on such matters and\nthankfully they have been varied enough to remain\ninteresting. All these enquiries and problems are\neither too routine or too delicate to report here.\nThe College bureau rc racy does often take time to\nchurn out response but it has not been too bad this\nyear, especially as many sections have been understaffed thanks( again) to UGC cuts. Surprisingly, the Union is equally bad and it has\noften taken ages to sort out financial or other\nmatters with club or union offices.\nMe\nAt the end of a very lengthy report, I thought I might\nadd a few personal comments. I have thoroughly\nenjoyed this year. Apart from the month of April, I have worked extremely hard both in terms of hours\nand productivity (but you only have my word for it).\nOnly occasionally has the job got to me and I "

Many of the more\nignorant and ill informed students around College think\nthey are only here to get a degree so wider political issues\nare irrelevant to their self-contained, insular cocoon of\nself delusion and well worn\nplatitudes. I would like to\npoint out to those people that\nthey are living in the real\nworld and its about time they\ngrew up and opened their\neyes to this fact; College is an\nideal forum for intelligent debate of the important political issues which concern\neach and every one of us.\nReturning to the Falklands,\nI fail to see why this anachron.istic remnant of bygone British Imperialism has to cost\nthis country thirty odd lives to\ndate, and several billion pounds which could be far\nbetter spent elsewhere, not to\nmention the lives of three\nhundred Argentinians, who\nare, after all, only pawns in\nthe power strategy of a contemptible fascist regime\nguilty of innumerable violations of human rights.\nThe government has, of\ncourse, as with all its policies,\nacted high handedly and without due consideration of\nthe consequences, motivated\nsolely by the desire to ref late its popularity in the hope of\nwinning the next election.\nThe decision to send the task\nforce fits into the predictable\npattern of events one is now\nconditioned to expect from\nthe emotion less zombies who\nare clinging to power by any\nmeans they can.\nTo them, it seems perfectly\nnatural to waste ^lO billion pounds on a ludicrous naval\nexercise around the Falkland\nIslands rather than spending\nit to create employment for\nsome of the 3m unemployed.\nThey chose their present\nhigh handed militaristic course of action, which puts\nthem in a comp ari ble league\nas the Argentinian junta, rather than over a sensible\nand peaceful solution. The\nIslanders should have been\ngiven the chance of being\nevacuated and flown back to\nBritain and then sovereign it y immediately handed over to\nthe islands rightful owners,\nthe Argentinians, instead of\nwhich the government has\ndug us into an untenable\nposition which it is trying through its intransigence to\nmaintain. I would hope that a motion in support of the\nArgentinian s claim to the\nFalklands will receive support\nfrom all the thinking members\nof this College at the next\nU GM. Yours\nR.S.

Cheers lads.\nYours\nJohn ( RS MVP) PS: The poor Moggi e's been on paracetamol all week\nand still isn't the better for the\n28 passengers she carried.\nDear Mark\nIsn't it about time that Rag changed its charity. For the\nthree years that I 've been\nhere, the money has always\ngone to the National Deaf\nChildren's Society. It's a worthy cause I'm sure, but\nthere are also many other\nworthy charities.\nSo why has the ND CS received so much support\nfrom Rag? Is it that the Rag Committee is so busy trying to\nstay in tack and suppress\ninternal squabbling that it\nhasn't any time to decide to\nwhom the money should be\ngiven; or is it that they are so\nunimaginative that they can't think of another charity.\nI'm told that there is a meeting at which all this is\ndecided; if so, it's never been\nsufficiently advertised. If the\nRag Committee expects people to participate in collecting and raising money,\nthen it ought to allow them to\nhave some say in where it\ngoes.\nYours sincerely\nGraeme ShawPS: OK \u2014 say it's not constructive criticism, but I'm willing to provide suggestions,\nif they tell me when the\nmeeting is.\nDear Mark\nI have to protest about the\nlack of controversy in FELIX614.

Returning to England in 1978 he\ntook an MSc in Computing at IC and was\nplaced top in his year. He then worked for\nScicon for a short while before returning to the\nDepartment as a Research Assistant.\nRichard possessed considerable musical and\nart is it ic abilities about which he was almost\nembarrassingly modest. As well as singing lead\nin the barbershop quartet 'Four to a Bar', well\nknown to IC students, he played several\nmusical instruments well and was a talented\ncomposer and arranger. While in Zambia he\nwas musical director of a production of Oliver,\na job which involved rearranging the entire\nscore to suit the range and abilities of\nmusicians available. His skills as a graphic\nartist will be remembered not only by those\nwho visited his flat or received a Christmas\ncard from him, but even by anyone who\npassed by his office door.\nBut he will be remembered best for his sense\nof humour and friendliness towards everyone.\nWho but Richard would compose and record a musical jingle for his telephone answering\nmachine? His openness about his own life\nmade it easy for his friends to share any of\ntheir problems with him. He will be missed by\neveryone he came into contact with.\nMST\nRichard Tate had shown himself to be a person\nof outstanding promise. He had already made\na major contribution to the research work of\nthe department. For nine months he was a leading member of the Augusta project team,\nwork which culminated in papers presented at\na conference at the N PL where Richard's contribution was widely considered to be the\nmost outstanding. He had already actively\nentered into the planning of a new project\nshowing great insight and judgement.\nHe had also demonstrated a flair for\nteaching both in lectures, where his artistic\ntalents were used to the full, and in supervising\nprojects. He will be sadly missed by all his\ncolleagues.\nVAD\nPage 2 FELIX, May 21, 1982\n\n"

    "content": "apologise to those who have suffered from my\nsudden discovery that I am capable of losing my\ntemper.\nIt is in my character to be a peacemaker and a diplomat which is one reason I stood on a platform\nof cooperation with College. The other good reason\nis that the more I think about it the more I believe the\nonly way forward is by cooperation. I often feel\nCollege officers and chairmen of College committees are misunderstood by students as being\n\"them\" against \" us\". This- is wrong, most of them\nhave the good of the students at heart. Unfortunately they also have the problem of balancing the\nbooks, and virtually everything comes down to\nmoney in the end. I hope next year's executive will\nbe tolerant and aware of the problems faced by the\nCollege as a whole and I hope they can maintain\ngood relationships with the College administration.\nAfter that diatribe above, I must thank the many\npeople on the \" College side\", especially John Smith.\nAlso I must thank the Union officers who have, in\ngeneral, worked hard, especially at the start of the\nyear, and they have been very good about keeping\nme informed of what they are up to. Thanks also to\nmy political advisers including \"The Think Tank\",\nChris Webb and Colin. A big thank-you to people\nfrom a whole range of sources, too numerous to\nmention, who have kept me entertained over a beer\nor two. The more social side of the job has been a pleasure.\nSpecial thanks to\nThe '22 Club for their continued inspiration.\nPhilip Nathan for restoring my confidence on two\nseparate occasions.\nChristine Teller for doing a huge amount of work\nboth before and after Barney's demise. (This is\nback-slapping amongst hacks.)\nMarco for his sound and reliable support.\nKen Weale for continued dedication to the cause\ndespite problems with Union junior treasurers.\nJen, Jo and Pat whose efforts and good nature are\nbeyond description. I have f alien in love with all\nthree.\nNick Morton\nPresident\n1981/2\nDeputy President's Annual Report\nIntroduction\nMy claim to write this report is tenuous at the least.\nAt present I am the acting Deputy President for a term of three months only and only by the agreement of five people at that, but I have been\ninvolved in many aspects of the DP's job throughout\nthe year and I think there should be some assessment of the year even if it is glaringly incomplete.\nFinance\nThis has been a hard year financially mainly due to\nthe loss of earnings from several sources and the\nrundown of House and Finance Committee funds.\nThis will reflect next year in a further decrease of\nflexibility in almost all areas and I particularly\nsym pathis e with those small clubs and societies\nwho will probably suffer most.\nOne of the areas of finance that has always\nworried me is the correlation between the allocation\nof large amounts of money and an eloquent or loud\nmouth (a past ACC Chairman being a prime sinner\nin this respect) at UFC major claims meetings. Nick\nand I initiated a new system earlier this year based\non the setting up of five year plans started by Rae.\nWe have replaced major equipment claims by five\nyear plans in order that our major expenditure can\nbe assessed in advance. I hope this will remove the\npersonalities aspect of major claims, though I think\nfive years is too long a period, two or three years in\nadvance would be sufficient, and will make the\nsetting up of plans less daunting for clubs. I hope\nthat claims will now be assessed more on their\nmerits. There will still be a fund for un for seen emergencies so no one will lose out.\nHouse Committee and internal Services\nI have been very disappointed at the performance of\nthese two committees. I have sat on both of them\nthroughout the year and have felt the meetings to be\na waste of time. The low attendance and complete\ndisinterest of members attending the meetings confirms my suspicions that people stand for these\ncommittees in order to add another tag to a list of\ncommittees for their own selfish aims. In the case of\nHouse Committee the interest of the other ordinary\nmembers in both long and short term issues affecting the Union Building seemed non-existant\nand even with Internal Services (where apart from\nthe Exec and P WP, each member is supposedly\nresponsible for a particular area) attendance and\nconstructive interest were minimal, with some not i cable exceptions. This is particularly worrying\nsince many of the problems this year were in areas\nsupposedly covered by Internal Services.\nAnyway, Nick and I will propose a change in the\nstructure of both of these committees that I hope to\nsee through next year. All I can say to people who stand for committees without taking the post\nseriously is BE WARE.House Committee has made several major and\ncontroversial purchases this year. We've added a partition to the Lower Lounge and upgraded the\nfurnishings, changed the key system in the Union Building, bought a baby grand piano for the Concert\nHall, re carpeted Southside Television Lounge and\ndecorated the Concert Hall dressing rooms. There\nhave also been many small but important additions\nto the furnishings, particularly we've bought several\ncupboards though at present I'm having trouble\ntracing their whereabouts. The lockers in the Gym have also been replaced and we've spent all year\ntrying to buy new typewriters. I'm presently trying to\nfind out whether we had a redecorating allowance\nfrom College and if so what Barney did with it!\nInternal Services has done virtually nothing this\nyear, though whether the fault lies with the committee or the Deputy President is a matter of\nconjecture. Internal Services covers areas like the\nLibraries, Bookshop, Bars and amusement machines, and more recently the Shop. Despite\npressure from the Committee, no summary of the\nstate of the Shop was forthcoming from Barney so\nlittle policy was decided upon. However this is in\nhand now.\nUnion Building, Bookings and Defects\nThe Union Building is in a sad state of repair, the\nrooms are shoddier and cutbacks in the College redecorating program are definitely showing. Good areas at the moment are the Upper Lounge and\nLower Lounge, a particularly bad area is the S CR which is virtually unfurnished. This room has great\npotential as a large committee meetings room and\nI'm sure is worth improving.\nThe booking system has been chaotic with the\ncompeting interests of so many groups and several\nparticularly troublesome outside bookings. The vicious circle of an increasingly unattractive building and a greater need to generate income from external bookings is becoming a major problem.\nThis is coupled with a lack of meeting and storage\nspace for own clubs. Fortunately major changes are\nin the air!\nThe defects I have dealt with have been many and\nvarious ranging from the decaying mens toilets\noutside the Bar and their effects on the basements\n(my thanks to the various men who provide me with\ndetailed reports of the state of the toilets) to the\ndisturbing breakin s In the Gym store, most probably from an outside body looking for one of\nthose bloody mascots.\nAmusement Machines\nBy Easter, the amusement machines were virtually\nunusable and had clocked up a deficit of \u00a3500. With\nthe additional cost of getting rid of the infamous\ncoffee machine, this area of the accounts was\nlooking dismal. Nick and I negotiated a contract, with\na new firm, that is safer for low turnover but less\nlucrative for large earnings in an attempt to combat\nloss of earnings through break-ins and vandalism\n(the causes Barney attributed to the loss of\nearnings). Though it is early days, the machines\nseem more successful, there have been no break-ins\nand the service we have received has been good.\nSouthside Shop\nThis is probably the greatest innovation in the\nDeputy President's area since the job became sabbatical, and was a marvellous idea conceived by\nBarney and Nick. However practical difficulties and\nthe neglect of tedious day-to-day aspects such as\nreordering have lead to a rather tough first year. The Shop now has apart time manager and the organisation finally seems to be settling down. This\nis the area to which I have devoted the greatest\nproportion of my time and I hope to see things on a firm basis by the end of June, there is still plenty of\nscope for development over the next two or three\nyears.\nA Shop Committee has been formed and I hope to\nsee an independent rep sitting on this committee\nand the rehashed Internal Services. I'd like to thank\nthose people in College who at times have seemed more concerned over the fate of the Shop than the\nUnion has itself, especially Lina Pelham, Roy Hicks and Dave Smith.\nCollege and Union Committees\nI have had very little contact with Coll d ge committees as Barney and I never discussed them\nand Phil has already stepped in here. I'm sure most\nstudents aren't interested anyway.\nSimilarly, my contact with Union committees that\nI didn't already sit on has been minimal. My apologies.\nCouncil\nWhat a waste of time, perhaps when Council is\ncomposed of officers who feel some sense of\nresponsibility to the Union and to the students they\nserve, Council will earn some respect. A first move\nin this direction must be to remove some of the\nmembers, the obvious choice seems to be the Qe pReps who with a couple of exceptions have contributed nothing this year and seem to me to be\namply represented by the Academic Affairs Officer\nand the three C CU A A Os. The other body I would\nlike to see removed is P WP. Odds and Sods\nSeveral areas I 've had little contact with:\nTransport\u2014this seems fairly stable now and is\nrunning to break even though we are not providing\nenough vans to meet all our needs.\nBookshop\u2014this is vastly improved this year. I am\nsorry that last year's problems have not resolved\nthemselves.\nFinally\nI'd like to thank all those who've supported me in my\nunprecedented situation, especially Matthew Tonks who has undertaken many practical jobs for me, the\nUnion staff (heroes), Marco (particularly for his help\nwith the noticeboards) and finally that drunken\ndegenerate Nick, the only President under who mI would have considered such a ridiculous proposition (?!).\nChristine Teller\nActing Deputy President\nMarch-June 1982\nHonorary Secretary's Annual Report\nInternational Conference of Students of Technology\nThis year's IN COST, the sixth held so far, was\nori gir fall y intended to be held in Poland in Katowice\nbut unfortunately after the onset of martial law\ncommunication was impossible and I heard nothing\nfrom Poland for months. The Swedes who were to\nbe the alternative organizers if Poland could not\nhost the conference then took on the task Although having little time they set to the task with great\nenthusiasm setting up a schedule of working groups, tours and functions and amazingly obtaining enough sponsorship from industry to\nmake the conference free apart from return fare to\nthe country. At the time of writing the conference\nhas not yet been held but I shall report on my return\nwhat I am sure will be a most successful and useful\nconference which I hope IC will continue to support\nby continuing to send delegates and maybe generating interest in other UK universities who have not participated actively in the past.\nElections\ni) Sabbatical The sabbatical elections this year\nwere a great source of controversy with confusion\nall round over election procedure, interpretation of\nthe voting schedule and misunderstanding of\nterminology. Luckily in the end sense prevailed and\npeople realised that the elections had not been\nun constitutionally run or biased to anyone candidate and were therefore fair and could stand.\nThe main point of contention was whether or not a candidate has to pass quota. Our voting schedule\nstates that if there is only one post then it is not\nnecessary to pass quota and this is only a level set\nwhich once passed, indicates that no further reallocations need take place.\nIn one sense it is lucky that this has occurred\nbecause it has resulted in many people taking an\ninterest in the elections and also our voting schedule possibly with a view to reviewing it. There\nhave even been suggestions of not using STV but\nusing the first past the post system, surely a godsend for future Hon Sees!!\n\n"

    "content": "ANNUAL REPORTS\nPresident's Annual Report\nUniversity Cuts\nThe most important issue of the year was probably\nthe government's massive cutback in university\nfunding. Although mediated by the University Grants\nCommittee ( UGC), the cuts were clearly government\npolicy and not a sudden wish to rational is e by the\nuniversities themselves.\nThe cuts will have serious effects on all universi-ties, including Imperial College, and I tried to convey\nthe gravity of the situation to the student body. My\nsuccess was limited but ICU did send over one hundred letters to MPs and also managed a token pre-sence on the march and lobby of Parliament in November. The replies to some of the letters was\nencouraging.\nThe action taken by ICU was hardly extensive and\nleft me wondering how to convince our students\nthat a major attack on the universities would seriously affect their successors, if not themselves.\nHowever, we were only a small part of a massive\nnational campaign incorporating students, trade\nunionists, academics and administrators. This campaign has not succeeded in reversing the cuts\nbut has ensured further cuts are not imposed.\nOn a local level, we have seen various attempts to\nsave money around the College. The crunch here\nwill come after I have left as the major item of\nexpenditure in College is salaries. Will voluntary\nresignations and retirements be enough, or will\nthere be compulsory redundancies? If there are,\nperhaps individual students will wake up to the\nreality of government education policy. Never mind\nlimited access to libraries, or fewer practical classes, how will students feel when their favourite\nlecturer is axed?\nQueen Elizabeth College\nOne response to the cuts in London has been the\nconsideration of College mergers. One or two may\nwell come to fruition, talks between Bedford and\nRoyal Holloway being particularly well advanced.\nOne merger considered was between Imperial\nand Queen Elizabeth. The initial talks started in\nearly November and I reported this to aUG M on\nNovember 10. The meeting nodded their heads and\nsaid nothing. A week later I reported to Council that\na working party had been set up to consider the\nmerger. In that report I stated that I felt nothing\nwould come of the talks because of academic opposition. Council nodded its collective head and\nsaid very little.\nAbout three weeks later it became clear that the\nmost likely \"area of closer collaboration\" was in the\nlife sciences. Suddenly RSC U and especially the\nbiologists were up in arms. What was going on? Why hadn't the President told us about all this? I nodded my head and said very little.\nThe initial concern of our students seemed to be\nover the future of the ARCS and the history of RCS traditions. Eventually sanity prevailed and an\nemergency U GM decided it should be more worried\nabout standards, student numbers and course options within the University. ICU adopted the\npolicy that if we were forced to live with the cuts, we\nshould offer the hand of friendship to another\nCollege( albeit under certain conditions). Whether\nor not they took up the offer was up to them.\nEventually the offer was not taken up because the\nconditions agreed by ICU and a large body of\nImperial academics were too stringent for QE C. The\nacademic differences between the two colleges\nwere too large. A QE C/ Kings merger is now being\ndiscussed.\nGrant Cuts\nAnother way of saving money on higher education\nis to cut student grants. A4% rise for next year\ntogether with no changes in the levels at which\nparental contributions are calculated is obviously a cut in real terms.\nThere seems little anybody can do to persuade a non-listening government that we are approaching\npoverty. The one glimmer of hope has come from\nthe Chairman of the House of Commons Education\nCommittee, Mr Christopher Price MP. He has shown\nan interest in the results of our Cost of Living survey\nand I hope Simon Rodan can make an effective\ncampaign out of this over the next fifteen months. It\nis quite obvious that IC students are not going to\ncampaign by massed demonstrations on the streets,\nso it is fortunate that I believe well reasoned arguments put to MPs are a far more effective\ncampaigning tactic. Thanks Simon and good luck!\nThe government has shelved the idea of partly\nreplacing grants with a loan scheme as they would\nbe unable to get the detailed legislation necessary\nthrough this Parliament. This is good news but may\nonly be a temporary reprieve as they still believe it is\na good idea. I don't. Overseas Students\nThe numbers of overseas students at IC continued\nto decline as a result of high fees.\nA minor concession on this front was that the\ngovernment did not increase the fees for overseas\nscience and engineering students.\nA loss for overseas students was that in future\nmost of them will have to pay fees for hospital\ntreatment during the first year of their stay in the\nUK.\nMost of this report so far has been rather depressing. The situation is serious and the morale\nof the higher education sector is low. However, it is\nnot all bad and ICU had a major stroke of luck in the\ncampaign against \"Full Cost\" fees for overseas\nstudents:\nOpen Door\nThanks to the initiative of Roger Stotesbury two\nyears ago, ICU was presented with the chance to\nmake aTV programme for BBC2 on the subject of\nfull cost fees for overseas students.\nI was quite pleased with the end result; the\nprogramme made its point in a reasoned fashion\nwithout resorting to sensationalist television. The\nfeedback I have had from College staff, students\nand one ex-student agrees it was a well-presented\ncase. Unfortunately I have only had two letters from\ncomplete strangers. I thought more people would be\ninterested in further information on the topic (there\nis certainly a lot to offer). Still, the audience should\nhave been around the million mark and if we have\nmade just a few people more aware of the problem\nthen we have achieved our aim.\nIt was certainly quite fun to make the programme\nbut none of it would have been possible without the\nteam. Thanks to Gordon Quartey, Nick Lamb rou and Marco for their research, Barney for finding a superb quote from Henry II! and a very special\nthanks to Lawrence Windley who gave up a great\ndeal of his time to help in research and production.\nSome Jolly Bits\nCongratulations are due to our University Challenge\nteam for winning three times to qualify for the\nknock-out part of the competition. Regretably, this\nreport was written before the quarter-final against\nSt. Andrews was recorded.\nI was very pleased that the Rugby Club and\nFootballClub both won their University Cup competitions.\nIt was a pleasure to host the British University\nChess Championship and a University Chess international in the Union. (All the organisation\nbrilliantly carried out by Tim Wright.)\nThankfully, these sort of events remain an integral\nand important part of student life at IC.\nAcademic Affairs\nLike my predecessor, I believe the Union's work on\nthe academic front is crucial.\nFor the undergraduate, we obviously want lecturers with the best quality lecturing skills. I hope\ntraining courses will continue to be taken seriously\nby probationary lecturers, even as the money for\nsuch courses decreases. However, I became concerned with more experienced lecturers. How do we tell them the message is not getting across to\nthe student consumer? The answer was the introduction throughout College of questionnaires\non each course. These have had some success in\nphysics where lecturers have noted dissatisfaction\nwith their speed, handwriting or whatever. I hope\nthe system will work in every department but it is\nvery much up to the Academic Affairs Committee to\nensure it does.\nOn the question of student feedback, I was most\nimpressed by the open discussion of an MSc course\nin the geology department I attended. The frank\nexchange of views was highly constructive. For\nsmall groups this system is ideal and may be worth\nconsideration in other departments.\nResearch postgraduates have a very different\nproblem (close to my heart, this one!). The over-running of research time has attracted the consideration of staff, students, administrators and\nthe national press this year. Because pressure is\ncoming from many quarters, improvements on the\nsystem are being found. Board of Studies at IC\npassed proposals to take greater care with selection\nof students, to include the progress of a lecturers'\nresearch students when reviewing a lecturer's promotion, to limit the number of students per\nsupervisor and to press for a close planning of the\nthird year between student and supervisor. These changes are steps in the right direction. At Graduate\nStudies Committee, ICU pressed for closer monitoring of a research students progress at the\nend of the first year. It is better to leave then than drag\non the problems. Formal monitoring is OK, but most\nuseful would be a change in attitude. No stigma\nshould attach to a research student who leaves after\none year. The change from undergraduate to\npostgraduate is a massive one and it is inevitable\nthat it will not suit everyone.\nI was less pleased with the Board of Studies decision to limit the writing-up period to 3 months. Doug Armstrong and I tried to warn PG s this would\nhappen both through the pages of FELIX and through departmental contacts. Did anybody seem\nto care? No. The decision slipped by unopposed. Residence\nThis subject made me rather unpopular in many\nparts.\nI welcomed the College's purchase of a new Hall\nin Montpelier Street. I hope (when finances have\neased again) that ICU will continue to adopt the\nconstructive long-term view that it is right to obtain\nmore College accommodation. However, there is no doubt that such purchases\ncan bring short-term financial problems and these\nwere obvious this year. The price of buying and\nconverting Montpelier Street combined with high\ninterest rates and a surprise increase in heating\ncharges meant the residence account would not\nbalance for 1981/2. The action taken was to cut\ndown on furnishings andre decorations and increase rents. When surveyed, the majority of Hall\nresidents said they would prefer a rent increase to a further cutback in furnishings, etc. Reluctantly I agreed to the rent increase. The on iy other course of\naction open to me was to organise a rent strike. This\noption was not constructive as eventually future\nresidents would bear the cost \u2014 money would not\nsuddenly appear from College or anywhere else to\nsub sid is e our rents. Indeed, hidden subsidies from\nCollege will be disappearing over the next few years\nwhich is going to make balancing the student residence account increasingly difficult.\n(Incidentally, most of the money lost through the\nrefectory boycott a few years ago also had to be\nreclaimed from the consumer. How else are boycotts or strikes financed? Sack a lecturer or\ntwo? Are short-term benefits to one year's students\nworth the long-term losses to future students?\nWhen will students realise that there is no magical\nfund to cover these things?).\nSo what to the future of residence? The heating\nproblem will be dealt with within a year as we take\nthe residences off the Department of the Environment's heating supply. The decorating and\nrefurbishment programme must be reinstated. Let\nus hope that the money is wisely spent, it has not\nalways been in the past, e.g. the installation of\ndouble power sockets in some Southside rooms this\nyear for no apparent reason. There are shabby and\npositively unsafe areas and facilities are not up to\nthe standards required by today's student. Hopefully interest charges will stabilise (Falkland\nIslands permitting), and we have made major savings for next year in the removal of the linen\nservice. The savings will be in the form of non replacement of retiring cleaners as well as actual\nlaundry bills. All this means the increase for next\nyear's rents should be roughly the same as the\nincrease in the grant.\nAs far as obtaining more accommodation is\n\n"

    "content": "Marco's Swedish\nBeano\nLast week I attended the sixth International Conference of Students of\nTechnology at the University of Lulea Sweden, the northernmost\nInstitute of Technology in the world. There were a total of 28 delegates\nfrom Greece, Yugoslavia, Poland, the Netherlands, Ireland, Finland,\nUSSR and Sweden. I was the only delegate from the UK. We arrived in Lulea on Monday, May10 for the official opening of the\nconference after which we were allocated to students who would be our\nhosts for the week. The following day saw the start of a hectic\nprogramme that left everyone shattered by the end of the week. We had\nto be at the College at 8:00am most mornings and discussion sessions\nnormally went on until 9:30pm. Trips were organised to a steel factory, a research centre and an iron\nore mine. These visits consisted of a lecture and then a tour. The size of\nthe ore mine was stunning; we toured 600m below ground in a coach on asphalted roads and had lunch in their canteen 500m down. Other trips\nwere arranged to a conference centre, around the city of Lulea and to a skiing resort\u2014across the arctic circle. Unfortunately we were too late to\nbe able to ski as there was not enough snow and we were too early in the\nyear to be able to see the midnight sun although we were quite close with\nonly V/2 hours of darkness.\nAt various points during the day we would split up into groups for\ndiscussions. At first there was a large amount of information exchange on\nhow our respective education systems worked and our students unions.\nWe went on to discuss technical development with specific reference to\ncomputing and the effects on society both positive and negative. All\nsessions were minuted and a booklet will be produced and forwarded to\nparticipants with a summary of these discussions. At the end of the week\nall the delegates put together a Final Document with a statement from\nthe conference stating that \" IN COST82 agreed that it is important that\nthe technologist takes his or her responsibility for the technology that\nthey develop. It was also agreed that in these days when development is\nmore important than ever, it is necessary to put more resources into\ntechnical education and research.\"\nUnion Honorary Secretary Marco\nLedwold has just returned from a \u00a3200\nall expenses paid trip to Sweden on the\nUnion! He reports his findings.\nSince drinking is frowned upon in Sweden the nights were not spent in\nbars but in saunas where informal discussion would continue together\nwith singing sessions, the repertoire ranging from Morning Has Broken\nto Four and Twenty Virgins. The week ended with the tenth anniversary\ndinner of the university attended by many local celebrities and over 500\nstudents and members of staff.\nI enjoyed the conference immensely and made many friends and I was\nsorry to have to leave at the end of the week. I would strongly\nrecommend that we continue to participate in IN COST which gives\nstudents internationally a chance to meet each other as people and\ndiscuss issues of technological importance, and not as politicians as is the\ncase with other international student conventions.\nMarco Ledwold\nICU Hon Sec\nBeit Hall\nSubwarden\nApplications are invited from female postgraduates for the post\nof Sub Warden in Beit Hall.\nThe Sub Warden will work together with the male Sub Warden, the Hall Bursar and the\nHall Committee, assisting the\nWarden in the organisation of the\nsocial life of the Hall and helping to\nmaintain an atmosphere of cooperative responsibility within the\nresident community.\nSelf-contained accommodation\nsuitable for a single person is\nprovided for the Sub Warden who\nwill generally be a postgraduate in\nthe first year of a course of study.\nThe post is tenable for a period of\ntwo years in compliance with\nstatutory regulations.\nApplications in writing, including\na brief resume of activities and\nexperience, should be sent to Dr.C.

    "content": "ii)Others There have been many elections at various\nUGMs throughout the year quite a few of which\nhave been contested; which is good to see, even if\nthe contest or is only a joke candidate; because then\nthe candidates have to fight for their post rather\nthan blithely sail in.\nFor some of the elections I placed job descriptions\nin FELIX and I think this was quite useful in\nattracting people who would not normally have\nstood because they would not have known what the\npositions entailed.\nDiscipline\nThe Union Disciplinary Committee will only have\nmet once this year which either means you've all\nbeen very well behaved or have been too crafty to be\ncaught. In the case of thefts from the pinball\nmachines earlier this year the latter applies despite\nattempts at surveillance.\nGestetners and Photocopiers\nThere have been many times this year when I have\nnearly resorted to physical violence with these\nmachines. Anyone who has been in contact with\neither will understand the frustration of trying to\ngently coax one of these machines into operating\nproperly when they are being stubborn. Unfortunately I have many dealings with these machines\nin producing papers for meetings and it is amazing\nhow the administration of the Union clogs up when\nthey are inoperative. If anyone at IC could produce\nan infallible desk top photocopier they'd become\nmillionaires overnight.\nParking Permits\nThese are allocated in the first two weeks of the\nautumn term and appeals in the third week. Then\nthere are no more permits available for allocation\nunless somebody returns their permits. Try as hard\nas I could to explain this, there are some people who\ncannot take no for an answer and have to be told to\ns off!\nI appreciate the parking problems in London and\nthe expense of a residents parking permit but\nunfortunately we only have a limited number of\nparking spaces for offer. Next year the situation will\nbe worse due to the construction of an automatic\nbarrier by the Exhibition Road entrance and other\nconstruction work in the College the Union's allocation has to be reduced by 17 spaces. Half of\nthese will be returned the following year when some\nwork is finished but students must be made to\nrealise the scarcity of parking space before they\nbring their cars down to College, preferably with a note in the Union Handbook and thus only those\nwith most need for a car will bring them down.\nUnion Directory\nThis publication produced by the Hon Sec lists all\nthe Union's clubs and societies and the names of the\npeople who run them plus the names of the Union's officers, the C CU officers and others such as FELIX,\nStudent Services, etc.\nThis is an enormous help in guiding people in the\nright direction when they ask how they can join a club or when we want to contact clubs for other\nreasons. But the Directory depended on newly\nelected club officers to bring/send their names to\nthe Union Office which I would appeal to you to do\nthis year for your own benefit as well as ours.\nI must thank Mark Smith for having it printed and\nfolding it before the beginning of term when he was\nbusy with production of the Freshers' edition of\nFELIX.\nExec News and UG Ms This year I have pasted up Exec News in the FELIX\nOffice and it has been printed as an insert in FELIX.\nIt was thought originally that this would encourage\nmore people to come along to UG Ms as each person\nwould be individually notified and also they would\nknow exactly what business was to be discussed\nwhich would enable them to participate more\nactively in the meeting. Unfortunately this has not\nalways been the case with what must be classed as\nthe worst ever attended and shortest U GM on\nrecord being held in the Great Hall on May 4 1982.\nThe attendance was around 30 and the meeting\nlasted less than a minute before the quorum was\ncalled, and rightly so! There were factors that\ndefinitely detracted from attendance such as\nsocieties organising meetings at the same time,\nhaving visiting MPs and lab sessions starting before\nthey should. But on the other hand the meetings\nthat have been best attended were those discussing\nmajor internal issues such as the Rag Mag, or the\nsabbatical hustings and results UGMs.\nSteps should be taken in future to ensure that\nsocieties do not organise meetings that clash with\nUG Ms. Next year's Exec plan to have a large\ncalendar on which all clubs and societies can place\nthe date and times of their meetings and I consider\nthis to be a step in the right direction to having\nbetter attended UGMs.\nThe problem of content of aUG M is more difficult,\nif there is nothing of interest being presented or\nbeing discussed then people will not attend\nmeetings even if there is nothing else to attend.\nHopefully though the day will never come when aUG M has nothing to discuss and the record set on\nMay 4 will stand unbeaten for a long time to come.\nCommemoration Ball\nAfter all my pan icing this was a very successful\nfunction enjoyed by many ex-students, for most\nprobably their last major College function. I really\nenjoyed organizing the Ball and would like to thank\nJen for working out the seating plan, the wine\nwaiters, and the heroes who stayed till early hours of\nthe morning and helped me clear up.\nMy predecessor Liz Lindsay put in to operation a plan to get the Blue Book on floppy disc in the\nCollege Publications department, but unfortunately\nwhen I went over with a copy they bau lk ed at the\nsize. They stated that in the present financial climate\nthey were short of staff as they could make no new\nappointments, and therefore could not spare the\ntime to type the document onto disc. So I was back\nto square one and started to hunt around the\nCollege for other facilities. Eventually I was offered\nthe use of the word processor facilities in College\nBlock but I had to find people who would be willing\nto do the actual typing in once they had been\ntrained by a member of the department. Two\nvolunteers came forward, Fiona Owen and Stephen\nBleazard and I would like to thank them for all the\nwork they have put in and are still putting in, into\ntyping up the Blue Book.\nOpen Door\nI enjoyed taking part in the production of the Open\nDoor programme and seeing behind the scenes in\nthe BBC. Most of the credit must go to Nick Morton,\nLawrence Windley and Nick Lambrou who put a tremendous amount of effort and work into its\nproduction. I must say thank you to Mac and Val of\nthe BBC for putting up with us and I hope they\nenjoyed making it as much as we did.\nInsurance\nI have made an effort to get as many clubs and\nsocieties inventories updated as possible. This is\nessential to ensure that lost or defunct equipment is\nno longer insured and also that new items of\nequipment are insured, more importantly the latter\nwhich is most common and costs the Union most\nmoney in the event of an accident. This has resulted\nin an increase in our premium over the las i year\nand also there have been several major items\nbought that have been added to the policy.\nCommercial Union, our insurers have this year\nrefused none of our claims which have been\nnumerous ranging from \u00a39 for a board game to over\n\u00a3200 for a set of water polo sweatshirts.\nThere have been several small claims on our\nEndesleigh Block Halls of Residence Policy which\nhave been settled but unfortunately there was one\nfor stereo equipment stolen out of a Southside\nbasement. Due to there being access to many\npeople basements are high risk areas for theft and\ntherefore are not covered and people place their\nbelongings there at their own risk. Bear this in mind\nif you wish to store possessions over the summer\nvacation.\nVans\nWe have a fleet of four transits for use by clubs and\nsocieties and also for private hire. Unfortunately this\nyear we have been plagued with breakdowns\nresulting in large repair bills and also loss of\nrevenue while the vans are off the road. Thus the\nTransport Account is not as healthy as it could be.\nAccidents have also eaten away at our no-claims\nbonus which has dwindled the account further.\nHopefully now that the vans have had major\noverhauls we should be able to pull in some income\nwhich will be needed for the future when a van\nneeds replacing.\nSports Day\nThis year for the first time Sports Day was organised\nby the Athletics Clubs Committee rather than the\nCC Us as in the past. This proved to be a step in the\nright direction with many people taking part on the\nday, ranging from good athletes to people just\ntaking part for fun. Overall the day was a great\nsuccess and credit must go to Kev Reeve, Lesley\nHorrocks, Mary Harrington and Jane Hillyer for ail\nthe effort they put into organising the event. All the\nwinners will be presented with medals at the AGM together with trophies for the best all-round male\nand female athletes.\nMost of the Sports Day trophies were stolen in\n1980 and I have been replacing them this year using\nthe money received from the insurers. Nearly all the\ntrophies have been replaced but unfortunately it is\nnot possible to engrave the names of the past\nwinners as this would be far too expensive, in most\ncases more than the actual cost of the trophy. All\nthat remains to be done is to have photographs\ntaken of the trophies for our records in case they are\nstolen or lost.\nRag\nThis year Rag has almost come to a standstill beset\nby problems inherited from previous years. A lot of\ngroundwork has been done to clear up the mess and\nset a firm base from which to move forward in the\ncoming years although slowly at first, still being\nshackled by having no licences. There are various\nideas afoot to collect on charities licences and also\nRag Week itself will be moved to the second term to\ngive the committees more time to organise bigger\nand better events.\nAlthough there are no collections going on at\npresent at the time of writing the Rag Fete is coming\nup and I am sure it will be very successful if the\namount of work put in by the Rag Chairman Ronan\nMacDonald is anything to go by. He also deserves\ncredit for taking on the sinking ship that Rag was\nand setting it on the right course for future success.\nCologne\nIn February Jezebel the motorized mascot of RCS, a1916 Dennis Fire engine went over to Cologne to\ntake part in its famous Karnival together with about\n20 RCS students and myself. Jezebel took part in\ntwo carnivals; one of which was televised throughout Europe. Everyone enjoyed the weekend\ntremendously and it is a memory of this year that\nwill stand out. I hope RCS Motor Club will continue\nto participate in the Karnival in future years!\nI 've greatly enjoyed my year as Hon Sec, though\nit's been very hard work at times, it's been an\nexperience that I wouldn't have missed.\nI would like to thank Nick, a President with\nincredible patience, one who it has been a pleasure\nto work with and drink to excess with.\nAlso Barney for his raspberries, roller skating\nsessions, conker fights, gin and tonics, curries and\nevery time he stopped playing the flute.\nI couldn't forget Christine who has done an\nincredible job at the same time as revising for her\nfinals.\nLast but definitely not least I would like to thank\nJen, Pat and Jo three wonderful people without\nwhom I couldn't have made it through the year. .\nMarco Ledwold\nHonorary Secretary\n1981/2\n\n"

    "content": "A Science Student's Discomfort\nby Tim Larcombe\nHave you ever in your studies of science asked\nyourself any of the following questions? Why\nam I here? What is this I'm studying? What's the purpose of this lab report? What is the\nlecturer saying? Why is he saying it? Where did\nit come from? Why should I believe it? Why is\nit so difficult to learn? Why are science\nstudents as they are? How do I relate science\n\u2022 to the world? Is it valid or a big con trick? Is it\nthe truth? Is it the absolute truth? \u2014 God's truth if you like. If you haven't asked any of\nthese questions, stop here.\nIf they have crossed your mind, have you\ngot satisfactory answers to them? These questions have constantly arisen in this, my\nfirst year at College. They didn't arise before at\nschool, because I did other things apart from\nscience \u2014 therefore I didn't have to feel\ncomfortable with it. But as we know things are\ndifferent now.\nI believe the root of these questions lies in\nthe fact that I could not put science and\ntechnology in a context relating to the whole\nworld. True, you see manifestations of science\nand technology everywhere but that does not\nexplain what they are.\nAfter a lot of so u! searching such a context\nsuddenly dawned on me. It may not be\ncompletely true but I think it has elements of\ntruth in it. Also I think it answers some of those\nquestions and makes me feel happier with\nwhat I'm doing. The purpose of this piece of\nwriting is to describe that context. It is not\nresearched, studies or anything like that and in\ndescribing it I may not fully justify what I say,\nbut it is my gut reaction. I want to convey and\nso please bear in mind these qualifications.\nMy aim is to share.\nFirstly, science. What is it and is it true? I now view it as mankind's attempt to describe\nnature; to quantify nature; to understand\nnature; to answer one of the eternal questions:\n\" Where amI?\"; possibly an attempt to\nmanipulate nature. For instance Nature says\n\"There is a quantity\" \u2014 of grass perhaps, or\nanything. It is man who counts the blades of\ngrass. Nature says \"If this thing whizzes round\ntoo fast it will break\". Man says that the\ncentrifugal force will stress the shaft beyond its\nshear strength and it will fracture in a certain\nway. He makes his measurement, does his\nmaths and predicts what will happen and why\non the basis of past experience.\nNature doesn't have to explain why things\nhappen in the order they do \u2014 man does \u2014\nentropy he calls it.\nSo that's what it is. Science is the abstract\ndescription of nature. Science is one of man's inventions to understand the universe.\nBut is science true? My answer is yes and no\n\u2014how convenient! It is true that it seems to\nwork consistently, but it is not the absolute\ntruth. If that were the case then it would be the\none and only description, totally different.\nHowever, having said that, let us not forget\nthat the inventors of science, the people who\ndescribe, were the likes of Pythagoras, Gallileo, Newton, Einstein \u2014 geniuses and\nthousands of other \"sub-geniuses\" following\non. These people were \"one in a million\" and\ntheir work merits great respect.\nWhat about the study of technology? In this\ncontext it becomes an abstraction of an\nabstraction. Man inventing uses of science\nwhich he invented to describe nature, and the\nbeautiful thing is that it works\u2014things do\nhappen as predicted\u2014space shuttles.\nIf one views science in this way, effectively\nyou are removing yourself from involvement\nand seeing it for what it is, which is much more\ncomfortable. What are the implications of this?\nI do not pretend to have thought these things\nthrough thoroughly but let our imaginations\nwander. By removing yourself from involvement and seeing things for what they are, are\nyou not widening your capacity for creativity\nand lateral thinking? Do you feel that\ntechnology is sometimes used solely because\none knows how to do it and that knowledge is\ngiven as justification for its use? I also wonder\nthat if science was taught in this context rather\nthan being battered into you (\"You'd better\nbelieve it or else you won't pass.\"), perhaps the\nawful barriers between science and arts\nwouldn't exist.\nViewed in this light, I think science and\ntechnology will become easier to accept, learn\nand use, given what it is. Now get back to\nlectures and revision and your future. How do\nyou feel? Good luck with your exams?\nTravel Insurance\nThis perennial role as harbinger of doom and gloom is not something I approach with great delight, but as part of preventative welfare it seems\nuseful if only to catch one or two of you who may go abroad this summer\nwithout adequate insurance cover, particularly those relating to possible\nmedical expenses. The following, rather bizarre as well as cautionary list,\nis a random sample from the claims settled by one insurance company\nduring the past year.\nUSA\nappendectomy\nmeningitis\nmajor heart attack*\nback trouble\nNetherlands\nfall*\nAustria\nFractured femur\nGreece\nfractured clavicle\nSwitzerland\nfractured back and arm\nHong Kong\near infection\n.Japan\nstomach operation\nTrinidad\nfuneral\nCanada\nfractured leg\n\u00a33,360\n\u00a32,900\n\u00a320,000\n\u00a33,600\n\u00a3850\n\u00a31,800\n\u00a31,800\n\u00a32,400\n\u00a31,400\n\u00a31,450\n\u00a31,000\n\u00a33,000\nFrance\ngall bladder \u00a32,400\nGermany\n\u00a32,400\nfractured hip \u00a32,400\nappendectomy \u00a31,200\nItaly\n\u00a33,680\nknocked over by a car \u00a33,680\nEgypt\n\u00a32,160\nstomach upset \u00a32,160\nIran\n\u00a35,500\nlimb injury, with amputation \u00a35,500\nAlgeria\n\u00a31,470\ncar crash \u00a31,470\nSaudia Arabia\n\u00a36,000\nhit by rocks* \u00a36,000\nKenya\n\u00a31,200\nappendectomy* \u00a31,200\nIndia\n\u00a35,000\nulcerative colitis* \u00a35,000\nBrazil\ninsect bites \u00a3900\nVisits to a doctor and routine medication can cost around \u00a375 in North\nAmerica and from \u00a330 to \u00a360 in Europe.\nIf you are visiting another EEC country you can get medical treatment\non exactly the same terms as its own insured people, so long as you meet\ncertain requirements and apply for the appropriate form ( El11, for which\nyou need to fill in leaflet SA30, obtainable from any DHS S office or\nStudent Services). To be eligible you need to be aUK national, a national\nof another EEC country, a stateless person or a refugee, and also to be\neither under 19yrs or to have been insured as an employed person at\nsome time during the last two tax years. Unfortunately this leaves some\npeople, including many students, without recourse to any free medical\ntreatment in the EEC. Even those who are covered will benefit from extra\ninsurance since some countries still require individuals to pay quite a substantial contribution. In France and Belgium for example patients\nmust pay around 25% of all treatment costs.\nIn addition there are reciprocal health care arrangements with Austria,\nBulgaria, the Channel Islands, Czechoslovakia, German Democratic\nRepublic, Hungary, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal,\nRumania, Sweden, USSR and Yugoslavia. DHS S leaflet S A30 gives\ndetails of the free services available to any traveller with aUK passport\nand/or NHS card. Hospital treatment is usually free, but not necessarily\nmedicine, dental treatment or treatment at a doctor's surgery.\nMost insurance companies have increased the medical expenses limit\ndramatically in the last year or so without an equivalent increase in\npremiums. It's not easy to give any general guidelines to the most\neconomical schemes since they tend to vary considerably according to\nthe type and duration of cover required, but it is well worth comparing\npolicies; one may be best for a two week trip to Europe while another\nmay be more economical for six weeks in North America. We do have\nsome examples which can be looked through at this office, including\nsome of those arranged by the main banks, such as NatWest. We also\nhave Endsleigh's application forms; although they specialise in student\ninsurance they are not necessarily the most advantageous.\nIf you are already covered by a work camp abroad, in a group or\npackage travel arrangement it is advisable to obtain precise details since\ncertain risks may not be included, or not sufficiently covered. Most\ninsurance policy application forms only contain a brief summary of the\ncover provided, so when arranging your own it is also advisable to inspect\nthe full policy, with all the conditions and exclusion s which apply, prior to\npurchase.\nStudent Services Office, 15 Princes Gardens.\n\u20223 Queen tickets, 6hr concert, Milton\nKeynes, June 5, \u00a39ono.

    "content": "Founded in 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nNO MORE\nWANKING\nIN WEEKS\n-OFFICIAL\nSenior Warden Dr Don Mon ro has proposed plans to house two\nstudents in single rooms in Weeks\nHall, of which he is also Warden, next year.\nWeeks Hall is a mixed Hall with 64 single rooms and it is\nproposed to \"double up\" eight of\nthese. The plan will involve putting bunk beds in the rooms\nand has been put forward as a means of offering all fresher s a place in residence.\nThere has been widespread\nobjections to the idea on the\ngrounds that the rooms are much too small.\nICU President Mr Nick Mo rton was told oi the scheme several\nweeks ago and agreed\" in principle\". Neither he nor DrM on ro consulted any students. It\nwas only when a student became\naware ol the scheme and objected\nthat the Union decided to oppose\nit, although they could not formulate policy as Council was\nin quo rate on Monday. Union Welfare Officer Mr Nick Pyne discussed the scheme\nat yesterday's Halls SubCommittee meeting, but the outcome\nis unknown at the time ol going\nto press.\nPresident-elect Steve Gould er said \" It' ll stop on July 1st,\" while\nas an alternative to testing the\nscheme on students, FELIX Editor Mr Mark Smith suggested\nthat DrM on ro and his sub warden test the scheme themselves by sharing a room during the summer (hence facilitating\nthe use of their fiats for the\nSummer Letting Scheme too).\nMore details should be available next week.\nREFECTORY TO CLOSE!\nA plan to close the Union Lower Refectory and open a pub-style food outlet in the Union\nLower Lounge was revealed by IC Union President Nick Morton late last week. The proposals,\nfirst discussed as long ago as February, include the possibility of demolishing the recently\nbuilt partition in the Lower Lounge.\nMorton brings house down\nResidents of the Montpelier St. Hall have at last gained the\nsupport of the Union President Mr Nick Morton over their\ncomplaints about the current state of the building.\nA typical Montpelier St bathroom; note view to room below\n(right) and mallet (foreground). Photo Jane Williams.\nThe discovery of dry rot in the Hall has led to extensive repair work,\ninvolving serious noise and dust problems during the vital examination\nperiod.\nMr Morton was informed over two weeks ago that a group of\nresidents had written to Student Services complaining about the\ncurrent work and the lack of facilities in the Hall. Some had refused to\npay rent but Mr Morton told F'ELIX that \" I'm going to do abo sul t ely nothing for them until they come up to the Union Office to see\nme\u2014and you can quote me on that!\" Earlier this week a resident approached the President with a copy of\ntheir letter and he finally agreed to act on their behalf.\nWhen FELIX visited the building on Tuesday workmen from the\nPhoenix Restoration Company showed us the extent of the rot. They are at present completing work on the kitchens and bathrooms on one\nside of the building up to the second t lo or, which have been out of use\n\u2022for over a month. When these are in use again they will start on the\nsame areas in the other side of the Hall. The process of restoration involves ripping away plaster and wood,\ntreating affected surfaces and then replacing these materials. This results in a certain amount of very unpleasant dust, as well as noise and\ninconvenience. Dry rot, we were informed does spread very quickly\nand the workman said it was necessary to treat it as soon as possible\nbefore many floors and ceilings became unsafe.\nThe proposals originate from the\nCollege Refectory Committee,\nchaired by Dr R. Schroter and were the subject of extensive discussions yesterday afternoon\nbetween Mr Nick Morton, Acting DP Miss Christine Teller\nand concerned parties in the\nCollege administration. These no\ndoubt include Refectory Man ager Victor Mooney, the manager\nof the Lower Refectory and representatives from the Estates\ndepartment (who would employ\npeople to knock down the partition which they employed\npeople to build last summer!).\nThe closing of the Lower Refectory would, in Nick Morton' s eyes, be favourable, he thinks\nthat the space can be used by the\nLInion for other purposes including sports (table tennis, b admin ton, etc.) and the usual use for\ndiscos.\nThe old cloakroom at the foot\nof the central Union staircase\nwould be used as a kitchen and a hole knocked into the Lower Lounge to act as a serving area.\nThis would mean that the games\nmachines would have to be\nmoved and, under the current\nplan, these would be placed in\nthe Ents Room while Ents would\nbe moved to the Lower Refectory\nkitchen.\nEfficiency of service under the\nnew scheme would have to be\nvery good; a pub style outlet\nwould have to satisfy the large\nnumber of students who currently\narrive in the Lower Refectory\naround 12:30pm. No details of\nMr Mooney's plans are known at\nthe time of going to press, but it is\nclear that the move would involve substantial problems for\na man who cannot adequately\n| run the present system.\nNo. 615 Friday May 21,1982 Free!\n\n"

Motions.\nPRESIDENT'S REPORT\nSome of my report is rehashed from the emergency meeting on\n25th March but I will start with a matter which must be\nminuted:-Deputy President. Barney McCabe resigned with effect from April2 nd1982. The Executive held an emergency meeting on 25th March and\nappointed Christine Teller as Acting Deputy President. It is both impractical to run an election this term and\nridiculous to expect anybody to stand for the post of\nDeputy President for a couple of months when exams are\nlooming. We must remain with an acting Deputy President. I make the following recommendations to this UGM:i) Endorse the Executive's appointment of Christine as\nActing Deputy President. ii) In view of the work load, offer some reward, not in the\nform of a salary but in the form of paying the rent for58 Be it Hall where Chris is now living.( Incidentally this was the arrangement before the post was made\nsabbatical). iii) Authorise that Christine' s name is engraved on the\nDeputy President's pot and added to the Honours Board\nin the Union Dining Hall. Sick Bay.\nThe health service is under considerable pressure to reduce\ncosts( like the whole College) and the area most threatened is the sick bay. The proposal is to charge first year\nresidents a compulsory insurance premium (about \u00a310) on\ntheir first hall bill. This will entitle individuals to free sick bay treatment for3 years. First years not in hall will be able to join voluntarily. A system will be\nworked out for second and third years. I was initially against a compulsory insurance but have changed my mind\nsince it is that or no sick bay. I propose we accept the\nidea in principle. Redundancies.\nThe Rector presented a plan at the last Governing Body\nfor redundancies, again emphasizing that they may not be\nnecessary in the near future. The College branch of the\nAUT have ideas for raising or saving money to prevent\nredundancies. Some of these ideas directly affect students so I sent my comments in writing to Governing Body.\nChancellor's Glass. I attended a reception for the Chancellor, HRH Princess Anne, at ULU and cleverly obtained the very glass from\nwhich she was drinking,( Coke!). I hope the Rag Chairman\nwill be able to raffle this magnificent trophy at this meeting.\nChancellor's Behaviour.\nTalking of HRH I still have not satisfactorily resolved the buffalo/ tiger affair but it is in hand.\nResidence.\nThe idea of paying rent over the vacation as discussed last term has been shelved. an ers in the halls are ret replaced.

    "content": "Council cancelled again!\nLast Monday's ICU Council meeting failed to open due to in quo racy, as over 50% of the 47 members of Council failed to turn up.\nThe meeting was to have discussed several important matters,\nincluding the proposed linen service for Halls, the plan to run an\nexperiment housing two people in Weeks Hall rooms and the awarding\nof colours.\nUnion President Mr Nick Morton called the absent members \" a bunch of miserable shits\" and said \" they' d better turn up on Monday, May24, when we'll try to have another meeting.\" He confessed that\nsome important College committees were meeting this week for which Council should have decided Union policy. However, in a meg lo maniac outburst he said \" If no other fuckers can be bothered to\nturn up then Christine Teller and I will make some bilateral decisions!\" This obviously indicates that Mr Morton did not wish to\nhold informal talks with the twenty Council members who did turn up\non Monday or even consult Honorar y Secretary Mr Marco Led wold. Next Monday's Council meeting will also discuss a motion removing\ndepartmental representatives from ICU Council and transferring\ntheir duties to C CU academic all airs officers. This motion has been\nprompted by the fact that only two dep reps attended last Monday's meeting.\nThe Southside Brothel\nThe lin al conversion of the lounge area of the Southside Bar to\nVictorian style should be completed within the next month.\nThis conversion is being financed by brewery loans and was started\nin January. Presently all the seating area needs to be upholstered and\nthe lighting work has still to be finished.\nThe wood panelling and flock wallpaper is already completed\nalthough it is hoped to hang some pictures on the walls. However Bar\nManager Mr Harry Magna y would like the pictures to change on a two monthly basis.\nAll the work is being done by outside firms and (the lack of) coordination between these, and general administrative delay is being\ngiven as the reason for the extended completion date.\nAlmost all of the structural work behind the bar has been finished\nand is a great improvement on the old real ale bar, which is adjacent\nthe Victorian bar and is now only used for functions. The modifications\nhave already improved conditions lor bar staff and the quality of the\nbeer, leading to an increase in turnover.\nAt present there a ie live real ales avail a be( one from each brewery\nfinancing the conversion) and it is hoped to have a sixth pump on soon.\nIn addition to pic s and rolls currently available Harry, an IC mining graduate, intends to stock plough mans lunches and hot food soon and\nalso to increase the range of wines and cocktails. Several cocktails,\nincluding some exclusive to Southside, are already available and\ninclude a green variety, Windscale.\nThere are also ambitious plans to show li lms, more live bands and\nperhaps even plays but these are unlikely to materialise before next\nOctober. These would be financed by the Bar Amenities fund which is\npartially funded by the profits of video games and pool tables\nbelonging lo the refectories (who run all College bars).\nThe current alterations do not seem to be causing undue discomfort\nlo the patrons, although one customer was heard to say \"It's changed\nagain; it's like a brothel.\"\nGuilds win\nGala\nGuilds beat RCS by 111-81 in\nthe ' inter C CU swimming gala\nlast Monday. The event was held\nin the sports centre and a sizeable\ncrowd attended despite the\nfailure of Mines to field a team.\nRCS won the mens race 52-42\nbut Guilds easily won the ladies\nrace and also won the water polo\nmatch to give them a comfortable\nvictory.\nThere was also an executive\nrace which did not count towards\nthe competition points and this\nwas won by RCS. Let's get\nphysical\nThe third Physics Open Day which was held last Friday was\nan unqualified success with almost four hundred sixth former s attending.\nProf Butterworth, Head of\nDepartment, gave a short welcoming speech and Dr Mei kle gave a short lecture on astro-no my. The Open Day was first held\nin 1980 and is always organised\nby physics undergraduates, principally the departmental representative who this year is\nMr Don al Bradley.\nMark Smith, currently FELIX Editor, organised the event in\n1980 and this year gave a short\ntalk about life at university.\nA major part of the Open Day is a display of first year laboratory projects and this year they\nincluded biophysics, computer\nsimulations of radio-active decay\nand Rubik' s Cube, holography\nand a study of the time of arrival\nof students for their early morning lectures.\nRag Fete\nSucess\nIC Union Rag Fete took place on\nSaturday afternoon on the Queen's Lawn. About400 people\nattended and over \u00a3400 was\nraised for charity. The fe te was\nopened by the Rector, Lord Flowers.\nThe Queen's Tower was open\nfor those who wanted to pay 30p to go up it and other entertainments included the ritual shaving\nof President elect Mr Steve Goulder.\nAnother attraction was the\nsoggy sponge throwing stall which gave an opportunity for\nparticipants to release their pent-up frustrations. Finally, Lady Flowers and IC Wives Club offered homemade jams and preserves for sale on their stall.\nWho gives\na damn\nabout Mike?\nThere has been absolutely no\nprogress in the search for the IC Union mascot Mike. In fact there\nhas been no effort expended whatsoever.\nThe1701 b micrometer, which\nwent missing from the ICU Office in the early hours of May6. seems to have been forgotten\nabout already. The Acting Deputy President. Miss Christine\nTeller has quite rightly left the\nmatter for the President and Hon Sec to deal with as they were\nresponsible for leaving Mike unattended in the Union Office.\nHowever, ICU President Nick\nMorton told FELIX\" Do you\nthink anybody really cares about\nthe thing?\"\nAn apology\nFELIX would like to apologise for a serious omission which occurred in\nthe May7 issue. Amidst the excitement of the loss of the Union mascot\nMike, we failed to can ya report on the U GM which took place on\nTuesday, May4. However, our on-the-spot reporter N. Willson has\nmanaged to recall the following about this exciting and extremely\nimportant occasion.\nAbout twenty boring farts gathered for the non-event of the term, the I 'GM in\nthe (ire at Hall on Tuesday. May 4. Some fat blok e with a moustache, or maybe\nthe fat slob with the beard, opened the meeting several minutes late. Quorum was\nchallenged and the fat slob with the beard ignored it. At a second attempt at\nchallenging quorum the bearded slob tried lo wiggle out of it by demanding to see\nthe challengers' union cards. even though one of the challengers (me) was known to\nhim by sight. Ian House, the other challenger, showed his card. The meeting\nclosed afl ei one minute an il twenty-fire seconds.\nThe ICU Annual General meeting will take place on Tuesday, May25, at 1:00pm in the Great Hall\u2014see you there!\nFELIX, May 21, 1982 Page 3\n\n"

Old pea brain spent\nMonday evening screaming about people not\nturning up to IC Council, and yet which little\nschemes crop up this week? Only the closing\nof the Lower Refectory, demolition of the\npartition and the sharing of Weeks Hall rooms.\nHe says that he and the Archangel Teller will\nhave to make all the decisions that Council\ndidn't. However, he's known about all these\nimportant items since February and only sees\nfit to mention then now, while people are busy\nwith exams.\nCrikey Nick, give us a break! If you were\nreally bothered about student opinions (which\nyou obviously aren't) you would have told us\nearlier. So shut you fat gob and sit down!\nMontpelier St.\nFurther evidence of Morton's premature senile\ndecay comes with his haughty I'm not doing\nanything for Montpelier St. until they come to\nme attitude.\nHe was elected to serve student interests\nand yet for the second time he is willing to sit\non his backside in the Union Office until\nMontpelier St. come crawling to the Mighty\nMorton, cap in hand. It's amazing how Morton\nmaintains that he's representing students considering that he's spent the best part of the\nyear helping College, to rip-off and deceive\nthese same students.\nBut then again, I hear that he does want a place on the College staff and a warden ship next year\nAnnual Reports\nThe AGM on Tuesday should be a real\nwheeze! The annual reports of the great three\nare enclosed in this issue and, as you can see,\nthey are the normal mishmash of boring\nrubbish and half-truths.

He says that he's had sleepless nights\ndeciding these, so here's a helping hand:\nNick Morton: you're joking!\nChristine Teller: a dead cert (and she'll\nget aUG A).

He's given\nJohn Smith them everything else.\nScaramouche: Well, if Christine Teller\ngets one and John\nSmith doesn't, add 4,\nthink of a reason why\nNick should give\nhimself one and you'll\nwin a haircut from\nMend-a Bike.\nN.

A browse through the STOIC archives, featuring material recorded over the last\nacademic year.\nTHE PHOENIX\n1982\nAvailable free from\nFELIX Office\nIC Union Office\nBookshop\nHaldane Library\nJust over a year ago I described the intriguing\ntelephone system in the East European town\nof Kuratowskigrad. You will remember that\nthere is no central telephone exchange, and\nyou can only phone one house from another if\nthere is an independent underground cable\njoining the two houses. No underground cables cross, and no cable passes under a house; each cable serves only the two houses\nat its ends.\nNow when I set the puzzle, I mentioned that\na friend who lives in the town' proudly informed me that he is connected to six of his\nfriends, and no one in the town is connected to\nless than five others'. This means there must\nbe at least fourteen houses in the town (see\ndiagram). But my friend has since written to\npoint out a slight inaccuracy: while I was right\nin saying that no one is connected to less than\nfive others, I should have said that my friend is\nthe only pes on connected to exactly six\nothers.\nSo now what is the smallest number of\nhouses there could be in Kuratowskigrad?\nShow your answer is possible by drawing a possible network of telephone lines.\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office, please. \u00a35 (donated by Mend-a Bike) for the best solution received by\nWednesday 1:00pm. Last Week's Solution\nOkay, so it was easy, but in the summer term\nthey have to be easy or no one enters. And although it was pretty trivial several people still\ntook nearly half an hour to find the solution. Of\nforty-three entries, the winner is C.N.G oh of\nElec Eng 3 and he can collect his cheque on\nMonday afternoon.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of the Imperial College\nConsort Road, London SW7 2BB(5895111 ext 1048 int 2881) Copyright\nUnion Publications Board, and is printed by the Union Print Unit, Prince\nFELIX 1982.

The\nsurface will be tarmac and the nets and posts\nwill be replaced. It is not expected that the\ncourts will be rc adv before June 16. Even\nthen, use will be restricted because the\nsurface must be allowed to harden.\nThe men's team have a strong squad of\nplayers to choose from this season, and is now\nthrough to the second round ol the Middlesex\nCup. Special credit must go to the team\nsuperstars C. Langervin. R. Daoud and G. Pike.\nIt is hoped that a men's open tournament\nmay be arranged for the end of term. Anyone\ninterested should see the tennis club noticeboard in the Sports Centre.\nCricket\nIC vs Inst of Ed\nHeigh ho! Never did the cornflakes taste\nbetter, never did the eggs taste fresher or the\nbacon crispier in the Bussey household last\nThursday morning. Why you ask? Well when\nthe chips were down for the IC Cricket team\non that fateful Wednesday afternoon, young\nSteve Bussey (he admits to being only 42)\nscored two runs off the lost ball to secure\nvictory for IC against some Institute of\nEducation celebrating afterwards with half a shandy Steve said \" I remember the last time\nI scored a run. It was just after the WorldCup(1966) when I delicately s nicked the ball\npast the wicket-keeper for single.\"\nAfter another half a shandy Steve was put\nto bed, waking next morning to read headlines in The Sun about his activities with\nthe Vicar's wife.\nThe only other notable performance in this\nmatch was Hinmer's bowling like a man with\nno arms and Eastland being hit for six onto\nthe main runway at Heathrow.\nTeam: White, Simpkin, Bell, Helsby,\nEastland, Marsden, Bussey, Farmer, Tear,\nI Hinmers, Heptinstall.\nScore: Institute of Education 125 for 8, IC126 for.8.\nIC vs St. Peters Oxford\nILast Saturday saw another memorable IC victory against St. Peters College, Oxford.\nInitial problems began with most of the IC team setting off for Cambridge and by the\nappointed starting time only four IC members were present, adjournment to the\nlocal pub was then decided as the best course\nof action. Three hours later a crumpled IC team took to the field. Eastland opened the\nbowling with his donkey drops and daisy\ncutters accompanied at the other end by that\neloquent colonial Hinmers, bowling like a man embarrassed about his underarm odour s. Fairly soon with with some benevolent umpiring, St. Peters were reduced to 22 for 5. It would have been for six\nexcept for that remarkable slip fielder Bell\n(who incidentally bears a striking resemblance to Henry the Hippo, that well-known\nballet star), who proved that he was a dab\nhand at dropping catches (a quick mention^\nfor his sponsors, Teflon). Bussey then got the\nsixth by bowling a straight ball, but Eastland\nmade up for this un sporting show by aiming\nfor Bell at second slip, who not being as\nstupid as most of us would have him, moved\ndaintily out of the way of the ball, onto the\nskipper's foot, who was not impressed (how\ncould he have been with that weight on it!?)\nFinally we all trooped off with opposition\ndeclaring of 124 for 8.c As our innings began, it started to rain and\nWhite decided that he did not want to get\nwet, so he got out. Henry the Hippo then\nwent in, scored a few runs, and then retired\nwith anorexia nervosa, due to his vast\namount of running between the wickets. Next\nout was 'Ooh-aar-me-back' Simpkin and he\nwas followed by the infamous IC middle\norder collapse, only to be saved by the\ncoolness of Tear and Water, who turned\ncertain defeat into defina te victory by two\nwickets.\nScores: St Peters College, Oxford 124 for 8;\nIC125 for 8.\nFELIX, May 21, 1982 Page 7\n\n"
