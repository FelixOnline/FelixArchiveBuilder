Bringing\ntogether her female friends,\nshe makes peace with the\nTrojan women, and they all\nagree to withhold sex from\ntheir gangster partners. \u201cNo\npeace,\u201d they cry, \u201cno pussy\u201d.\nThe movement quickly catches\non: first the women of Chicago, then the United States,\nand then the women of the\nworld don chastity belts and\ntake a vow of celibacy. The\naction is frequently marked\nwith set-pieces, such as the\nwomen taking control of a\nnational armoury by seducing\na Confederate-flag-loving\nracist general, or the absolute\nhowler of a scene where the\narmy try and get the women\nin the mood by blasting out\nslow jams by The Chi-Lites.\nThe mood, however, is\nimportantly \u2013 organise.\nThe script, by Lee and\nKevin Willmott, is stellar,\nsomehow managing to veer\nfrom rip-roaringly funny to\nachingly tragic in the space\nof a few stanzas, and retaining rhyming verse for the\nmajority of the film. They may,\nperhaps, let things run away\na little bit sometimes \u2013 there\nare a number of subplots\nthat don\u2019t really need to be\nthere, and the whole thing\ncould probably benefit from\nbeing 20 minutes shorter\n\u2013 but overall the film feels\nboth joltingly contemporary\nand true to the original. The\nclassical choruses of old men\nand women are replaced by\nthe Knights of Euphrates and\na group of female elders,\nrespectively, with the women\nled by Angela Bassett. Lee\nretains the stichomythia (the\nshort punchy alternating\nlines) of the original, and the\nparabasis (the address to the\naudience) is given by Samuel\nL. Jackson, who is clearly\nhaving a ball chewing on\nthese delicious lines.\nAfter the early furore that\nsurrounded its announcement,\nChi-Raq goes far beyond\nwhat we might expect, delivering a film that manages to\nshed a light on the unsettling\nundercarriage of American\nracism whilst also remaining\nhugely entertaining \u2013 no\nmean feat. For all intents and\npurposes, it signals a return\nto form for Lee, combining\nthe daring vernacular aspects\nof Do the Right Thing with\nthe sweeping epic feel of\nMalcolm X. With one foot in\nthe past, and the other firmly\nin the present, Chi-Raq is a\ntour-de-force of bleak humour\nand righteous fury.\nFred Fyles\nChi-Raq marks a return to form\nfor Spike Lee, and its breathless\nanger is urgently needed in these\ntroubled times.\n\\\\ Rising\nincarceration rates,\nprivate prisons,\ngentrification \u2013\nnothing escapes the\nglare of Lee\u2019s cool\nfury \\\\\nnever wholly light: Lee\nensures that the script goes\ndeep into the issues that\ncurrently pervade the US,\nforcing viewers to confront\nthe continuing legacy of\nslavery and white supremacy.\nRising incarceration rates,\nprivate prisons, gentrification \u2013 nothing escapes the\nglare of Lee\u2019s cool fury. The\nscript name-checks not only\nthose who have been killed\nby police over the last several\nyears, but also more recent\ndevelopments, like the Black\nLives Matter movement and\ntargeted killings: \u201cThat evil\nyoung Klansman / Dylann\nStorm Roof? / He\u2019s the proof.\n/ Post-racial... poof\u201d \u2013 in four\nlines Lee destroys the myth\nof a \u2018post-racial\u2019 America\nthat was supposed to have\nheralded in the inauguration\nof Obama. Lee doesn\u2019t let\nanyone get off lightly: while\nthe oppressive circumstances\nthat drove many of the young\nmen to crime in the film are\nexplored, the gang members are also made to take\nresponsibility, both for their\nown actions and the gradual\ndegradation of gangs\u2019 moral\ncode over the last 30 years.\nBut the film is not exclusively\nset on the mean streets of\nChicago: they are vilified and\ncelebrated in equal measure,\nwith each shooting offset by\na view of a beautiful street\nmural, but Lee also focusses\non the interior lives of his\ncharacters \u2013 both metaphorically and literally. A large\nNo peace, no pussy! \\\\ Roadside Attractions\nThe sound\nand the\nfury of\nSpike Lee\nis higher than NYC and LA\ncombined. Chicago trauma\nphysician Amy Ho wrote in\nThe Chicago Tribune that Lee\n\u2018has managed to trivialize the\nsuffering of the men, women,\nand children of Chicago\u2019s\nWest and South sides\u2019, and\nmany were quick to agree.\nCombined with the fact that\n\u2018A Spike Lee Joint\u2019 doesn\u2019t\npromise radical politics in\nquite the same way it did in\nthe 1980s and 90s, Chi-Raq is\na pretty tough sell.\nWhat a joy it is, then, to see\na film that delivers both quick\nhumour and biting satire,\nwhilst also marking a return\nto form for Lee. Chi-Raq is\nan urgent film, desperate-ly-needed in today\u2019s troubled\ntime of mass incarceration\nand police brutality. Teyonah\nParris, perhaps best known\nfor her role of Dawn in\nMad Men, plays Lysistrata,\ngirlfriend to Demetrius \u2018Chiraq\u2019 Dupree (Nick Cannon),\nwho is leader of a local gang\ncalled the Spartans. In a\nBloods/Crips-style feud, they\nare at war with the Trojans,\nwhose leader \u2018Cyclops\u2019 is\nplayed by Wesley Snipes.\nEach gang has their own\n\\\\ The film manages\nveer from rip-roaringly funny to\nachingly tragic in\nthe space of a few\nstanzas \\\\\n\\\\ Chi-Raq is\nan urgent film,\ndesperately-needed\nin today\u2019s troubled\ntime of mass\nincarceration and\npolice brutality \\\\\nproportion of scenes take\nplace within central hubs of\nthe African-American commu-nity: gospel churches, barber\nshops, reading groups. They\nare shown to be the beating\nheart of the African-American community, places\nwhere individuals can meet,\ndebate, and \u2013 perhaps most\nI\nn the world\u2019s current\nsituation, a film that can\nmake you laugh, cry, and\nleave with a warm, fuzzy\nfeeling is desperately\nneeded. The newest\nDisney princess film, Moana,\nis the answer.\nThe storyline follows Moana\nWaialiki (Auli\u2019i Cravalho),\ndaughter of Chief Tui\n(Temuera Morrison). Growing\nup on a South-Pacific Island,\nshe is forbidden to ever venture further than beyond the\nconfines of the reef. However,\nwhen her homeland begins to\nwilt and die, she must accept\nthe ocean as a new comrade\n(yes, they really made the\nocean a cutesy sidekick), set\nout to find demi-god Maui\n(Dwayne Johnson), and save\nthe world. Along the way,\nthey encounter dangers ranging from entirely ridiculous\nlittle coconut/pirate/demon\nthings, through to a mildly\nterrifying shiny crab and the\nmisunderstood (but no less\ndangerous) lava monster.\nAlthough the storyline seems\na little bizarre, it is based\non genuine legends from\nseveral South-Pacific Islands,\nproviding a marvelous opportunity to revel in the stories of\nsun-drenched beaches, and\nescape the drizzly realities of\n2016.\nOne of the most notable\nalterations to the usual Disney\nPrincess offerings is the total\nlack of romantic storyline \u2013\nthis is wonderfully refreshing.\nThe heart of the film instead\ncomes from the relationships\nbetween Moana and those\naround her. The storyline\nwith her parents delicately\nwalks the line between loving\nher family and following her\nown path \u2013 she does this,\nsurprisingly, without a single\nutterance of \u201cYOU DON\u2019T\nUNDERSTAND ME\u201d. Her\ngrandmother, played by\nRachel House, gives wonderfully eccentric relief, being the\ndon\u2019t-give-a-damn OAP that I\nthink we all aspire to be. The\nrelationship between Maui\nand Moana stays platonically\nteacher-student, with a sweet\ndevelopment and a high level\nof personal growth. Although\nthe trope of \u2018arrogant, muscled lead learning to open up\nand care for others\u2019 is a bit\nold, the moments of vulnerability are touching, and the\ninteraction with another cute\nsidekick in the form of a mini\ntattoo version of himself make\nit less stale.\nAnother notable difference\nis the soundtrack: in a move\naway from traditional Disney\nfilms, the songs are not standalone belters, but instead\nthere is more of a feeling of\na real musical, with melodies\nintroduced in the beginning\nweaving throughout \u2013 with\nthe exception of the horribly\ncreepy crab song. The presence of Lin-Manuel Miranda\n(of Hamilton fame) is heavily\nfelt, and all for the better.\nThe stunning backdrop\nas they sail across the\noceans, combined with the\nheart-warming storyline\nand enjoyable music, means\na successful evolution for\nDisney princesses. The\nmusic, message, and lead\nprincess\u2019 body proportions\n(she actually looks human)\nare very welcome changes. If\nyou want a serious highbrow\nmovie, then this isn\u2019t your film,\nbut if you want a warm hug\nof a film with a few tears,\nmessages of self-love, and\nacknowledgement it\u2019s okay\nto get fired up every so often,\nthen you will love this film as\nmuch as I did .\nBy Jenny Shelley\nS\nometimes a perfect\nopportunity can just\npresent itself to a\ndirector. Citizenfour\nis a film whose\nmere existence\nis incredible. Based on the\ndrama of Edward Snowden\u2019s\nwhistleblowing on the mass\nsurveillance being performed\nby the NSA in America,\nCitizenfour is the final film\nin director Laura Poitras\u2019\nAmerica After 9/11 trilogy.\nWhat makes it so unique is\nthe privileged access that\nPoitras had to Snowden\n(codename: Citizenfour) as\nhe decided to pull the trigger\non his leak. Poitras and\njournalist Glenn Greenwald\nare the two people Snowden\npersonally reached out to\nvia encrypted emails to help\nhim get his message out,\nawarding us a much more\npersonal look at Snowden\nas a person. Speaking as\nsomeone relatively ignorant\nto the entire situation, I\nfound his portrayal deeply\nhumanising: Snowden comes\noff as a deeply humble,\nintelligent, and responsible\nman. We leave the film with\nan understanding of his\ncharacter and his values\nwhich would be unachievable\nthrough any interview or\nother piece of media.\nIt is in this personable\naspect that the film finds its\nbiggest strengths. Poitras was\nnot afraid to take the time out\nat various points to focus on\nlittle things such as Snowden\nhurriedly flicking through his\nlaptop or nervously doing his\nhair. Time is also set apart\nto allow Snowden to set out\nhis views and philosophies\nin a series of spontaneous\ninterviews in his hotel room,\nallowing him to outline why\nthis documentary is so impor-tant. The film is also not afraid\nto raise a number of its own\nquestions, mostly through\nselect clips from debates and\nlectures, from the balance\nof privacy vs. security to the\nmeaning of sovereignty\nFrom a technical standpoint\nCitizenfour is near perfect. It\nhits all the marks that a good\ndocumentary should: it\u2019s\nthought provoking, relevant,\nand attention holding, with\na perfect balance between\ntension-building slower\nmoments and a steady driving\npace. Only in Citizenfour\ncould a hotel\u2019s routine fire\nalarm test get my heart nearly\npounding out of my chest. The\nmassive depth of research is\nwonderfully presented in a\nway which gets across a lot\nof information without being\noverwhelming. Citizenfour\ndefinitely displays a great\ndeal of intelligence, as well as\nthe journalistic passion which\nshines through with Poitras\nand Greenwald.\nA cut above your typical princess \\\\ Disney\nCitizenfour\nBy Ben Collier\nDOCUMENTARY OF THE WEEK\nMoana, the latest offering from\nDisney, eschews the traditional\nprincess story, in favour of a sunny\nescape from the miseries of 2016\nSnowden fighting against the man \\\\ HBO Films\nMoana\n\n"

Don\u2019t cycle without a helmet like this idiot).\nBut more importantly because it\u2019s our first proper\nTHICK issue, a good 48 pages long. Now I will be\nthe first one to confess that my minor concussion may\nbe partly why I decided to push for 48 pages rather\nthan keep it to a comfortable 40, but the fact remains\nthat this is the longest issue I have personally been\nresponsible for putting together. I\u2019m also completely\naware of the fact that you have absolutely no interest\nin this but I also have a minor concussion which is why\nI will pat myself on the back thank you very much.\nNow, as you might have noticed, I started writing this\nwhile waiting to be seen at A&E. I honestly really wish I\nhad finished it then because, in the words of the doctor\nthat flashed a flashlight in my pupils and asked me to\nfollow his finger as he waved in front of my confused\nface \u201cEverything will hurt a lot more tomorrow\u201d. And\nyou know what kid? It\u2019s almost like he could see the\nfuture. Long story short it hurts. A lot. Ouch.\nYet here we are once again, persevering for your\nentertainment.\nThis week we are running an issue on intersectionality.\nBecause we love pushing our mental capacity to\nits limits, championing causes, trying to think of\nappropriate #content that will push the agenda\nwithout offending too many people.\nJoking aside intersectionality is an important issue to\naddress. Imperial is so very diverse. In this tiny bubble\npeople of all religions, class, sexuality, genders, ages,\nand ability converge. It\u2019s easy to look at all these\nelements individually and try tackling oppression on\na case to case basis. However it\u2019s only through the\nrealisation that all oppression is linked, \u2013 sexism,\nclassism, homophobia, they\u2019re the same \u2013 that we can\neffectively tackle it.\nHaving said that, next term we\u2019ll definitely be taking\na break. I cannot keep this up you guys. So get ready\nfor the potato issue, the watching paint dry issue and\nthe CBA issue. They will be great.\nUntil then enjoy. If the quality of the paper makes\nyou want to cry save it for next week\u2019s sob-fest at\nQueen\u2019s Lawn.\nAnd remember, always wear a helmet. Even when\nyou\u2019re just walking. Even in bed.

The development team was changed\nand reshuffled, with\nHajime Tabata taking\nover as director, and\ndevelopment started from\nscratch. Amazingly, after\nmultiple delays, the game\nwas finally released last\nMonday and from reviews\nand my own impressions,\nit is fantastic!\nThe Last Guardian is\nT\nen years is a very\nlong time. Ten years\nago in 2006, the\nXbox 360 had been\nout for a year and\nboth the Wii and\nPS3 were released. Call of\nDuty 4: Modern Warfare\nreleased the following year,\nthus starting the boom of first\nperson shooters. The original\niPhone didn\u2019t even release\nuntil 2007; instead, the\nnewest portable Apple device\nwas the iPod 5G. NASA also\nlaunched their New Horizons\nspace probe to perform a\nflyby of Pluto, which it just\ncompleted in October 2016.\nTen years is not only\nenough time for the\ngaming landscape and\nvery special games: Final\nFantasy XV and The Last\nGuardian.\nFinal Fantasy 15 began\ndevelopment back in\n2006 as part of the\nFabula Nova Crystallis\nFinal Fantasy \u2013 a trilogy\nof games based upon the\nmythos of crystals being\nlinked to deities. The three\ngames were Final Fantasy\nXIII, Final Fantasy Versus\nXIII and Final Fantasy\nAgito XIII, though over\nthe next few years this\nchanged significantly. Of\nthe three games, the one\nmost important to this\ndiscussion is Final Fantasy\nVersus XIII, as it was initially named.\nAs Final Fantasy Versus\nXIII, it began as a spinoff title that was darker\nin tone and allowed the\ndevelopment team to take\na different approach. The\ndevelopment was led by\nTetsuya Nomura, famous\nas lead director for the\nmuch-lauded Kingdom\nHearts series. Then disaster struck as the game\nunexpectedly met with\nsevere difficulties during\ndevelopment, and over the\nfollowing six years it sadly\nonly appeared in small\nfragments. The decision\nwas then made to shift the\ngame from the PS3 to the\nPS4 and Xbox One, so\nthey switched from their\noriginal game engine\nto their newly-designed\nengine, Luminous Studio.\nThen, at E3 2013, came\nthe monumental moment\nwhere the game was publicly announced as Final\nFantasy 15, rebranded\nas a mainline entry in the\nanother extremely interesting\ngame. It started development\nin 2007, just after the release\nof the PS3, by Team Ico, the\nminds behind Ico and the\ncritically-acclaimed Shadow\nof the Colossus, considered\nto be one of the best games\nreleased on the PS2. The\nLast Guardian was planned\nto release early in the PS3\u2019s\nlife and was shown off in\nboth 2009 and 2011, though\nafter this, word on the game\nceased completely.\nOver the next few years,\nmany assumed the game to\nbe dead, buried because\nof its incredibly troubled\ndevelopment. The game was\nconsidered to be progressing\nextremely slowly by Shuhei\nYoshida, president of Sony,\nand other studios were\nbrought in to improve the\ncode and game performance.\nThe decision was then made\nto switch to the PS4 and even\nmore teams were called to\nhelp adapt the code to suit\nthe PS4.\nAnother major factor was\nthe decision of Team Ico, specifically the director Famitsu\nUeda, to leave Sony in 2011,\ndue to \u201ca sense of crisis\u201d on\nhearing about the game\u2019s\ndelay. Many left to join other\ncompanies and work on other\ngames. Despite leaving and\nforming a new studio, gen-DESIGN, Ueda still remained\nas the main developer of the\ngame and worked alongside\nThe release of two giants\nSony to finish development.\nFour years later at E3 2015,\nthe gaming landscape was\nshaken when the game was\nofficially announced to be\ncoming to the PS4 in 2016.\nThe rumours that it was dead\nwere silenced and after the\nannouncement the excitement\nwas palpable. The game will\nrelease this Friday and much\nlike Final Fantasy 15, early\nreviews are very positive.\nE3 2015 was dubbed \u201cThe\nE3 of Dreams\u201d by the former\nteam of GameTrailers, currently Easy Allies, and I must\nsay I agree. Final Fantasy 15\nand The Last Guardian were\nboth stuck in development\nhell for almost 10 years, and\nlooking back it is a miracle\nthey are being released at all,\nproving that dreams really\ncan come true.\n\\\\ Over the next\nfew years, many\nassumed the game\nto be dead \\\\\nsmartphones to change\ncompletely, (as well as for\nNASA to launch a space\nprobe to Pluto), it is also\nhow long it took to finish\nthe development of two\nWhile waiting for your favourite game, you can roleplay as your favourite game \\\\ Pauli Marttinen\n\n"

A stunning\nworldofglamourandgrime,Blue\nVelvet is a masterpiece.\nD\negraded,\nslapped around,\nhumiliated and\nundressed in\nfront of the\ncamera\u201d wrote\nRoger Ebert, esteemed\nAmerican film reviewer,\nof Isabella Rossellini\u2019s\nperformance in David Lynch\u2019s\n1986 film Blue Velvet. \u201cWhen\nyou ask an actress to endure\nthose experiences, you should\nkeep your side of the bargain\nby putting her in an important\nfilm.\u201d Ebert\u2019s feelings on\nthe film \u2013 which were\nresoundingly negative \u2013 were\nunchanged up until his death\nin 2013, but clearly many\npeople disagree: last week\nsaw the re-release of the 30th\nanniversary edition of Blue\nVelvet. Today, Blue Velvet\nstands among one of the\ngreatest films of the 1980s,\nand marked a turning point\nin David Lynch\u2019s illustrious\nand beguiling career. Call it\nmasochistic, pretentious, or\neven misogynistic if you want\n\u2013 just don\u2019t call it unimportant.\nBlue Velvet revolves around\nthe duality of everyday life,\ninviting us to take a peek\nunderneath the surface of the\nReaganesque fantasy of the\nAmerican dream. In its much-loved opening sequence, we\nare introduced to a world of\nwhite picket fences, smiling\nfiremen, and lush green\nlawns. This is dramatically\ninterrupted when a man\nwatering his front garden\nsuddenly collapses; the hose\nspurts serpentine arcs of\nwater as the man lies helpless\nin the mud.\nWe find out that this man\nis the father of Jeffrey Beaumont, played by long-time\nLynch collaborator Kyle\nMacLachlan, who is made to\nreturn to Lumberton, North\nCarolina \u2013 a town whose\nradio station welcomes us\nwith a dawn chorus of \u201clogs,\nlogs, logs!\u201d. On the way back\nfrom the hospital he stumbles\nacross a severed human ear,\nand this is the point where his\ntroubles begin. Pretty soon he\nfinds himself trapped between\ntwo different women: the\nsweet girl-next-door, Sandy\n(Laura Dern), daughter of the\nlocal detective; and Dorothy\nVallens (Isabella Rossellini),\nan abused nightclub singer,\nwhose husband and child\nhave been taken hostage.\nJeffrey soon finds himself\ntripping down a rabbit hole\nof secrets, unearthing the\ndark elements of society that\nlurk just beneath a well-to-do\nfa\u00e7ade, and running into\nFrank Booth (Dennis Hopper),\na vicious psychopath who\nhuffs on amyl nitrite and violently abuses Dorothy. While\nanother director may take a\nstraightforward approach to\nthe plotline, Lynch eschews\neasy resolution, instead\nsubverting the film noir genre\nto create a finished piece\nwhere nothing quite adds up.\nCertain characters pop up in\na single scene, and then are\nnever seen again, while some\nloose ends remain untied by\nthe time the credits roll, in an\nintentional attempt to challenge the viewer.\nFrom the very beginning\nof Blue Velvet, Lynch sets out\na template of themes that\nhe has followed over the\nlast three decades: the ugly\nunderbelly of of violence\nlying behind polite society\nthat\u2019s running through 1990\u2019s\nWild at Heart; the portrayal\nof dichotomies. In Blue Velvet\nwe have the two protag-onists, Jeffrey and Sandy,\nwho exude an all-American\ncharm, a tremendous vitality\nthat seems to come from a\ndiet of red meat, milk and\nwholesomeness. They are\ncontrasted dramatically with\nthe sleazy, sad coupling of\nFrank and Dorothy, a relationship defined by rape and\nabuse. There\u2019s even a schism\nspatially, with Lumberton split\nright down the middle by\nLincoln Avenue, which marks\nthe meeting points of the\ncalm suburban world of wine\nand roses, and the run-down\napartment blocks and abandoned factories that mark the\nother side of town. But while\nthe first half hour of the film\nsets up these archetypical\ncharacters, Lynch spends the\nremainder of the film demolishing all boundaries between\nthe two worlds, bringing\nthem crashing together in a\ndisorientating maelstrom. It\u2019s\nthe same technique he uses in\nMulholland Drive, when the\ntwo separate plotlines begin\nto coincide with each other,\nor in Twin Peaks, where the\nlines between the natural and\nsupernatural bleed into each\nother.\nSimilarly, Lynch sets up a\nvisual dichotomy, with the\ndeep blues of club interiors\nplaying off against the red\ncurtains that would become a\nsignature element of his films.\nDarkness and light play key\nroles in the film: when we are\nfirst introduced to Sandy, she\ncomes shining out of the dark\nlike a beacon of hope, while\nthe film\u2019s seemingly happy\nconclusion is marked by a\nbrilliant flash of white. For\nLynch, visual motifs are more\nthan mere aesthetic elements,\nbut instead reflect a deeper,\nsymbolic meaning, that\nhas made his work ripe for\ninterpretation \u2013 from Michael\nAtkinson\u2019s Freudian take on\nBlue Velvet to Laura Mulvey\u2019s\nargument that the central trio\nof Frank, Dorothy, and Jeffrey\nrepresent the Oedipal family\nunit. Like the French director\nAlain Resnais, Lynch\u2019s work\nrefuses to conform to a single\nexplanation, making it all the\nricher.\nWhere Blue Velvet is\nperhaps most important,\nhowever, is in its soundtrack:\nthe film marked the first\ncollaboration between Lynch\nand composer Angelo Badalamenti, with whom he would\nwork again and again. Badalamenti composed half of\nthe tracks on the soundtrack,\nwhich create an eerie sound-scape that weaves its course\nthroughout the film, never\noverplaying its hand; for\nthe remainder of the tracks,\nBadalamenti chose a series of\nvintage pop songs, which perfectly accentuate the physical\nFred Fyles\nThe disquieting strangeness of Blue Velvet\n\\\\ Blue Velvet\nmarked a turning\npoint in David\nLynch\u2019s illustrious\nand beguiling\ncareer \\\\\nof a small town riddled with\ndark secrets that forms the\nbackbone of his TV series\nTwin Peaks; and the idea of\ndouble identity, which he has\nreturned to again and again,\nmost obviously in his 2001\nmagnum opus, Mulholland\nDrive.\nLynch\u2019s world is one that is\ndefined by the establishment\nDorothy Vallens, the troubled singer at the heart of Blue Velvet \\\\ Warner Bros\n.\n.\n.\ns\no\nm\ne\nb\nody lip-syncs to a creepy\nso\nn\ng\n!\n\\\n\\\nW\na\nr\nn\ne\nr\nB\nr\no\ns\nF\nor about the first\n90 minutes of The\nUnknown Girl, I sat\nrather unimpressed\nin my leather chair\nin one of the small\ntheaters at Soho Screening\nRooms. Then, as the last half\nhour unfolded, directors JeanPierre and Luc Dardenne tied\ntogether multiple plot lines\nlike a beautiful bow on a\nChristmas present.\nWithout spoiling the ending,\nthe film centres around Dr.\nJenny Davin, played by actor\nAd\u00e8le Haenel, who hears\nsomeone knocking on her\nfront door to her practice.\nBecause it is late at night,\nDavin feels uncomfortable\nanswering. The next day,\nat a nearby river.\nDavin, feeling immense\nguilt, makes it her mission to\nfind out who this girl was,\nand for the rest of the film\nthe Dardenne brothers take\nus through a strange roller\ncoaster of a story \u2013 except\nthat coaster splits up on to\nmultiple tracks, until the last\n30 or so seconds, when the\ncars join to finish on one line.\nThe film\u2019s main strength,\nbesides its satisfying finish,\nis how it is always focused\nthrough the lens of Davin\u2019s\ncharacter: we are with her\nthroughout every step of her\njourney to find out who this\n\u2018unknown girl\u2019 is. And boy, it\u2019s\na strange, unpredictable and\nexciting ride.\nThe initial reviews of The\nUnknown Girl, however, have\nnot been kind, with many\ncritics citing a predictable\nnarrative and a lack of\nexcitement. Perhaps this is\ndue to the fact that many\nEnglish-speaking critics\nexpect much more from foreign films, but for me \u2013 while\nthese criticisms are certainly\nfair enough for the first 90\nminutes \u2013 the ending is so\nwell-orchestrated that I realised why the rest of the movie\nwas made the way it is.\nOne of the main themes\n\\\\ The Dardenne\nbrothers tie together\nmultiple plot lines\nlike a beautiful bow\non a Christmas\npresent \\\\\nthroughout the film is truth.\nAt first, multiple characters\ndo not wish to disclose what\nthey know, where they were,\nor what they were doing\nthe night of the girl\u2019s death.\nMeanwhile, in a separate\ncase, Jamie\u2019s intern Julien \u2013\nplayed by Olivier Bonnaud\n\u2013 tells Jamie personal infor-mation, as an explanation for\nwhy he quit his dream to be a\ndoctor.\nIt is in these closing scenes\nthat we feel a sense of\nintimacy, and step deeper\ninto these people\u2019s lives. I\nfelt like I was right there with\nDavin, hearing their stories\nand becoming emotionally\nexhausted, despite the fact\nthis is a fiction.\nAgain, I won\u2019t dive too\nmuch into the plot, because I\ndon\u2019t want to ruin the delayed\ngratification that you may\nexperience if you do choose\nto invest just under two hours\nto watch this movie. But I will\nsay that if you want a movie\nthat makes you think about\nthe importance of telling\nthe truth, The Unknown Girl\narticulates it in an interesting\nway. And, being a reporter\nby trade, finding the truth is a\ntheme I can appreciate in any\nmovie I watch.\npolice show up to inform her\nthat the person knocking was\na woman \u2013 who was caught\non her surveillance footage \u2013\nand she has been found dead\nDr Davin, on the case \\\\ Curzon\nThe Unknown\nGirl ties\neverything up\nin the end\nviolence that is happening on\nscreen. Badalamenti would\ngo on to work with Lynch in\nfive of his films and \u2013 most\nnotably \u2013 in his TV series Twin\nPeaks, whose soundtrack\nhas since reached cult status,\nand was reissued this year on\nDeath Waltz records.\nWhile David Lynch\u2019s career\nmay have properly gotten\nstarted with Eraserhead,\nhis first feature film, made\nin 1977, it wasn\u2019t until Blue\nVelvet that he set down\nthe off-kilter template he\ncontinues to follow to this\nday. Navigating between the\nworlds of surrealism and natu-ralism, Lynch\u2019s work achieves\na sense of unease that no\nother director working today\ncan match. Blue Velvet is a\nstunning film; beautiful, mean-ingful, and most definitely\nimportant.\n\\\\ You know when\nyou\u2019re in a David\nLynch film when... \\\\\n...there\u2019s a visual dichotomy\nbet\nw\ne\ne\nn\nt\nw\no\nc\ne\nn\nt\nr\na\nl\nc\nh\na\nr\na\nc\nt\ne\nr\ns\n!\n\\\n\\\nW\na\nr\nn\ne\nr\nB\nr\no\ns\n...the banality and horror of sm\na\nl\nl\n-t\no\nw\nn\nl\ni\nf\ne\ni\ns\nu\nn\ne\na\nr\nt\nh\ne\nd\n!\n\\\n\\\nW\na\nr\nn\ne\nr\nB\nr\no\ns\n\n"

It is the\nsort of opera that has\nfuelled the caricatures of the\nart form \u2013 it is confusing,\nextravagant, and filled with\nimpassioned singing, known\nas much for its convoluted\nplotline as for its musical\nbeauty.\nBased on the 1836 play\nEl trovador, Il trovatore is\na story of high melodrama\nand conflict that spans two\ngenerations. Originally set\nin Aragon in the 15th\ncentury,\nthe Count di Luna is madly in\nlove with the lady Leonora.\nYears ago, the previous\nCount had a 'gypsy' woman\nunjustly burnt at the stake\nfor allegedly bewitching di\nLuna\u2019s infant brother Garzia.\nWith her dying breath, the\ngypsy woman commanded\nher daughter \u2013 Azucena \u2013 to\navenge her by throwing the\ninfant Garzia into the flames.\nIn the heat of the moment,\nhowever, Azucena mistakenly\ncasts her own child upon\nthe pyre and raises Garzia\nas her surrogate son. Now\nknown as Manrico, he is a\nknight outlawed for pledging\nallegiance to a rival prince.\nBringing the story full circle,\nManrico and Leonora are\nlovers; meanwhile, di Luna\nsearches for Azucena to\navenge his brother\u2019s\ndeath.\nThe opera\nrevolves around\nthese four\ncharacters,\neach with their\nown intense\npassions.\nInspired by\nthe boldness\nof his charac-ters, the parts\nVerdi wrote for\nthem are difficult\nand require great\ntechnical skill. As\nEnrico Caruso, the\ngreat Italian operatic\ntenor, famously said,\n\u201cAll you need for Verdi\u2019s Il\nTrovatore are the four greatest singers in the world.\u201d I\nwould stop short of such high\npraise of the Royal Opera\ncast, although they make an\nadmirable attempt to rise to\nthe challenge. Maria Agresta\nas Leonora faltered on the\nhigh notes of her arias such\nas Tacea la notte placida\n(The peaceful night lay silent),\nthough she did improve as the\nnight went on. As Manrico,\nNajmiddin Mavlyanov played\nthe chivalrous knight to perfection with his melodic voice\nbut did not quite bring out the\nfervour needed in the scenes\nof conflict. I enjoyed Quinn\nKelsey\u2019s rich baritone; his solo\nIl balen de suo sorriso (The\nlight of her smile), in which di\nLuna expresses his undying\nlove for Leonora, was deeply\nmoving.\nThe indubitable star of the\nshow, however, was Anita\nRachvelishvili as Azucena.\nAzucena is the character on\nwhom the tension of the plot\nhinges; though she has the\npower to reconcile the two di\nLuna brothers at any point,\n\\\\ A classic opera,\nwith an excellent\ncast and ambitious\ndirection \\\\\nIl trovatore |\nMelodrama and\nmusical beauty\nClaire Chan\nIl trovatore is on at the\nRoyal Opera House\nuntil the 4th\nof February 2017\nTickets from \u00a39\nNajmiddin Mavlyanov as Manrico,\nMaria Agresta as Leonora\\\\ Catherine Ashmore\nher desire for vengeance\nhinders her from doing so,\nand the story ends in tragedy.\nVerdi saw her as the principal\ncharacter, going so far as\nto claim, \u201cIf I were a prima\ndonna (a fine thing that would\nbe!), I would always rather\nsing the part of the Gypsy in\nIl trovatore.\u201d With such big\nshoes to fill, Rachvelishvili\nembodies the part of Azucena\nimpressively. Her smouldering\nvoice made for a breathtakingly intense Stride la vampa!\n(The flames are rising!), while\nher duet with Mavlyanov in\nNon son tuo figlio (I am not\nyour son) was one of the best\npieces of the evening.\nDirector David B\u00f6sch\u2019s\nproduction premiered in July\nearlier this year to largely\nlukewarm reviews. Personally,\nI found it quite aesthetically\npleasing; the bleak, snow-filled landscape contrasts with\nthe flames of the pyre that\nare an ever-present threat.\nThe anachronistic elements\n\u2013 di Luna\u2019s military tank, the\ngypsy band transformed into\na travelling circus \u2013 detracted\nfrom rather than improving\nthe production, but were easy\nenough to ignore. Maybe I\u2019ve\nbeen desensitised after too\nmany avant-garde operatic\nproductions, but this really\nwasn\u2019t so bad.\nConductor Richard Farnes\nled the ROH orchestra in\nVerdi\u2019s dramatic and\ncaptivating score. This\nis the first opera by\nVerdi I\u2019ve seen, and\nthe music made\nit immediately\napparent why\nhe has such\na legacy as\nan operatic\nlegend. A\nclassic opera,\nwith an excellent cast and\nambitious direction \u2013 definitely\nrecommended.\nAnita Rachvelishvili as Azucena \\\\\nCatherine Ashmore\nThe Little\nMatchgirl and\nOther Happier\nTales\nE\nmma Rice has\nencapsulated\nthe spirit of the\nseason in the\nSam Wanamaker\nPlayhouse\u2019s\nChristmas production of The\nLittle Matchgirl and Other\nHappier Tales, and it\u2019s not as\njubilant as you might expect.\nThe artistic director has baked\ntogether several of Hans\nChristian Anderson\u2019s tales\nto create a composite piece,\nwhich in her own words is a\n\"theatrical Christmas pudding\nof many flavours\". The\nstories take us on a turbulent\nemotional journey; the play\nopens with Thumbelina, a\nheart-warming tale of triumph\nin the face of adversity. The\nminiature heroine is delicately\npuppeteered by Bettrys\nJones, and the adventure\nis flecked with comedy by\nthe double act of Kyle Lima\nand Jack Shalloo who we\nencounter as garrulous\ntoads and later as pompous\nbeetles. There are moments\nof genuine fright, none more\nso than when Thumbelina is\ntaken hostage by a depraved\nmole; the caprices of the plot\nare unexpected and leave\nyou at the edge of your seat.\nNext is The Emperor\u2019s New\nClothes. This is a light hearted\ntake on the parable; keenly\naware of its audience in\ncosmopolitan London and full\nof references to Shoreditch\ndesigners and EDM. We all\nawait the final twist, as the\nmesmerised child in front of\nme whispered, \"he\u2019s not going\nto go out naked is he?!\" but\nit\u2019s still magnificent when it\ncomes. Luckily for Paul Hunter\nwho plays the emperor (and\nthe rest of us no doubt) there\nis no full frontal nudity here,\nEzra Kitson\ninstead, the Emperor wears\na luridly detailed onesie, it\u2019s\na reveal so unexpected, so\nfilled with kitschy whimsy that\nthe room explodes into laughter and applause.\nThe third story is The\nPrincess and the Pea, and in\nthis interpretation, the plot\nhas been changed slightly.\nInstead of the happy ending\nthat I was told as a child,\nhere the insecure prince loses\nthe princess due to his lack\nof faith. This reworking of\nthe narrative, brought the\natmosphere to a sombre level\n\\\\ By turns whimsi-cal, frightening, and\nkitschy \u2013 Emma Rice\nhas enapsulated the\nspirit of the season\nin her adaptation \\\\\nThe Little Matchgirl is on at the\nSam Wanamaker Playhouse\nuntil the 22nd\nof January 2017\nTickets from \u00a310\nEdie Edmundson (puppeteer) as The Little Matchgirl \\\\\nSteve Tanner\nappropriate for the show\u2019s\ntragic end. Throughout the\nperformance, the overarching\ntale of The Little Matchgirl\nprovides the crucial link in\nthe narrative as we pass from\nstory to story. She is always\nwith us on stage, alone and\nshivering in the cold London\nstreets, dreaming up vibrant\ntales to pass the night. There\u2019s\na warmth in story telling that\nshe has shared with us, but it\nwill only help so much; as she\nstrikes her final match and\nthe flame begins to fade she\nis discovered prostrate and\nlifeless by a passing police-man. The finale is deeply\nmoving, the shift from Victorian to modern day London\nconveyed through costuming\nand in dialogue by the actors\nremind us that poverty is not\njust consigned to storybooks;\nas Emma Rice concludes in\nher introduction: \"if only this\nwere just a story\".\nIt\u2019s a message of hope, not\ndespair that Rice wants to\nsend. At the performance's\nend, the audience is reminded\nof the ongoing work of organisations such as Crisis and The\nSalvation Army. We leave the\ntheatre with a festive appreciation of the privileges that we\noften take for granted, and\na powerful warning of the\ndangers in being blind to the\nindigence of those who aren\u2019t\nso lucky.\nEdie Edmundson (puppeteer) as The Little Matchgirl \\\\ Steve Tanner\n\n"

Second\nedition.\nSome of the key findings of\nthe report are particularly\nsurprising. Surprising, that is,\nif you\u2019ve lived in the Siberian\nwilderness your whole life.\nThe report proudly claims\nto have uncovered that\n\u201cYounger people are more\nlikely to take drugs than older\npeople\u201d. Yes, this is an actual\nfinding. It makes you wonder\nhow much taxpayers\u2019 money\nwas spent on this valuable\npiece of information. Fifty\ngrand? One hundred grand?\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019d have been able to\nchurn out the same information for a fiver.\nFurther exciting discoveries include that \u201cMen are\nIf you\u2019re struggling with drug\nuse, visit talktofrank.com\nmore likely to take drugs\nthan women\u201d. Apparently\naround one in eight (11.9%)\nmen aged between 16 and\n59 had taken an illegal drug\nin the past year, compared\nto around one in eighteen\nwomen (5.4%). Furthermore,\nthere have been no notable\nchanges regarding gender\nbetween the 2014/15 (this\ndocument is produced every\nyear?!) and the 2015/16\nsurveys. With the discrepancies between sexes you would\nthink the infamous male-fe-male Imperial ratio would\nensure we\u2019d all be awash with\nillegal substances.\nAnother of the findings is\ndependent on lifestyle factor.\nThis fascinating document\nproclaims that \u201cillicit drug use\nvaries by lifestyle factors such\nas frequency of nightclub\nvisits and alcohol consumption\u201d. Seemingly, the use of\nClass A drugs by persons in\nthe twelve months prior to\nthe research was around ten\ntimes higher in those who had\nvisited a nightclub more than\nthree times in the past month.\nThe drug of choice for these\nindividuals is mainly cocaine\nand ecstasy, which makes\nperfect sense to me. I mean,\nwho wants to take ketamine\nin a club? Similarly, if you\nvisit a pub or bar more than\neight times, statistically you\nare 26 times more likely to\nuse cocaine than those who\nhad not visited a bar or pub\nat all in the last month. To\nme these findings appear to\nmake sense. Basically, this\nmeans that if you\u2019re one of\nthose stereotypical Imperial\nstudents who\u2019s allergic to\nMinistry of Sound then you\u2019re\nless likely to enjoy some good\ncoke on a Tuesday evening.\nSeems legit.\nThe area in which you live\nalso has an effect. The \u201cuse of\nany drug was higher among\nthose living in urban areas\ncompared with those living\nin rural areas\u201d, with 9.1%\nof people in urban areas\nhaving used a drug in the\npast year, compared to 6.5%\nof those in rural areas. So\nwe London-living students\nshould have no problem\nfinding someone to supply\nthose illegal study drugs. In\nconjunction, information is\nalso provided on those living\nin \u201cdeprived areas\u201d. The use\nof any drug is more widespread in areas considered\nto be the most deprived by\nthe government. With 10.2%\nof these people experiencing drug use, as opposed\nto 6.9% in \u201cnon-deprived\u201d\nareas. It should seem simple\nthen for the powers-that-be to\nimplement drug rehabilitation\ncentres effectively (if they\nwere competent). But judging\nby the current stance of political elites worldwide, drug\naddicts are unlikely to get\nlittle more than a polite wave\nand maybe a jail cell from\ntheir friendly neighbourhood\npolitician.\nIt seems that people of\ndiffering gender, age and\ngeographical location have\nvaried habits when it comes\nto drug use. Basically, if\nyou\u2019re a young male living in\nLondon who visits a pub nine\ntimes a month then you\u2019re\nmore or less guaranteed to\nbe a crack addict.\n\\\\ If you\u2019re one of\nthose stereotypical\nImperial students\nwho\u2019s allergic to\nMinistry of Sound\nthen you\u2019re less\nlikely to enjoy some\ngood coke on a\nTuesday evening \\\\\n\\\\ Basically, if\nyou\u2019re a young male\nliving in London who\nvisits a pub nine\ntimes a month then\nyou\u2019re more of less\nguaranteed to be a\ncrack addict \\\\\n\\\\ With the\ndiscrepancies\nbetween the sexes\nyou would think\nthe infamous male-female Imperial ratio\nwould ensure we\u2019d\nall be awash with\nillegal substances \\\\\n\n"

It\u2019s no\nnews really, that technology\nis revolutionizing our lives\neveryday. Three news\nfeatures this week illustrate\nhow technology is also\nchanging the way we\nthink about something that\nhas remained relatively\nunchanged in our lifetimes:\nurban transport.\nOn the second of December,\nthe mayors of Paris, Madrid,\nAthens and Mexico City\nconfirmed a joint plan to take\ndiesel cars and vans off the\nroads of their city centres by\n2025, in an attempt to tackle\nair pollution and reduce\nglobal warming effects.\nAlthough the effects of air\npollution are something we\nare all vaguely aware of, not\nuntil recently has the full magnitude of the problem become\nuncovered by research. In\nfact, as stated by Helena\nMolin Vald\u00e9s, the head of the\nUnited Nations\u2019 climate and\nclean air coalition, more than\nnine out of ten people worldwide live in areas where the\nair pollution exceeds World\nHealth Organisation safety\nlimits, and 3 million premature\ndeaths are caused by dirty air\nyearly, as well as a number\nof illnesses, especially among\nchildren. Diesel vehicles have\nbeen rising in a number of\ncountries for the last couple of\nyears due to the fact that they\nare more economically viable\nand burn fuel more efficiently\nthan petrol engines. However,\nthese engines produce nitrogen dioxide, a detrimental\ngas, and small particles that\ncan remain in the lungs and\nare responsible for the majority of air-pollution related\nillnesses.\nAs these cities pledge to\nremove diesel vehicles from\ntheir roads, and urge other\nleaders to follow suit, the\nquestion that many of us have\nis what these diesel free cities\nthat we might expect to live in\n10 years will look like? Electric cars? Bikes? Clean fuels?\nA few major retailers,\nincluding John Lewis, Argos\nand Waitrose appear to have\nfound what could already\nbecome a short-term solution.\nThey confirmed earlier this\nweek that some of their\nlong-distance lorries will\nutilize an innovative green\ngas to deliver their Christmas\nparcels. It consists of a renewable biomethane fuel that is\nderived from food waste and\ncan only be used in trucks\nwith gas engines, less polluting than traditional petrol\nand gas ones. CNG Fuel has\nreported that not only is it\nless polluting and emits 70%\nless carbon dioxide than the\ncurrent options available on\nthe market, but it is also 40%\ncheaper than diesel. It is the\nfirst biomethane approved for\nuse under the government\u2019s\nRenewable Transport Fuel\nObligation scheme (RTFO),\nwhich has recently been\nrevisited to include proposals\nto incentivize the use of biom-ethane in transport sector.\nWaitrose and John Lewis have\nalready invested more than\n\u00a31m in CNG trucks, and have\nalready reported a positive\nopinion and significant cost\nsavings.\nWhile clean fuels therefore\npresent a promising alterna-tive, others have chosen to\ntackle the problem from a\ndifferent angle: incentivizing\nother clean forms of transport\nand aspiring to remove the\n\\\\ Perhaps the\nreality of clean\ncities are not that\nfar into the future\nafter all \\\\\nneed for cars altogether.\nA few days ago, London\u2019s\nmayor, Sadiq Khan, promised\nto spend \u00a3770m on cycling\ninitiatives over the course\nof his term, indicating that\nhe wants to make the bike\na \u201csafe and obvious\u201d form\nof transport for Londoners.\nThis investment amounts to\n\u00a317 per day, per person,\nper year, which nears that of\npredominantly cyclist nations\nsuch as the Netherlands and\nDenmark. This sum has associated with it proposals for two\nnew cycle super highways,\nseparated from motor traffic,\none of which would go from\nTower Bridge to Greenwich,\nand the other from Olympia\nto Hounslow West. This\nspending represents 5.5%\nof the transport budget for\nLondon, and would also\nbe extended to expand the\nsuperhighways planned\nunder Johnson. Maybe the\npossibility of Londoners\ncycling their daily commute\nsafely is not far-fetched any\nlonger.\nWith the effects of air\npollution becoming imminent\nin cities all around the world,\nthe happy dreams of many\ngreen activists of cities\u2019 parks\nreplacing highways and all of\nus roaming around in electric\ncars, might not be so much\na wishful aspiration but a\nnecessity. It appears that the\neyes of the leaders of cities\nworldwide have been open\nenough that the realization\nof the importance of taking\naction has struck. It is now the\ntime for renewable and clean\ntechnologies to shine and to\npartner with businesses to\nmake them affordable and\navailable to governments\nworldwide. It seems that perhaps the reality of clean cities\nis not that far into the future\nafter all.\nAlexandra Lim questions whether eating burnt food\nposes a risk to health, and how these could be avoided\nT\nhe perennial\nquestion. You notice\nthat slightly-too-blackened edge of\nyour fried chicken\nthigh during a\nfriend\u2019s thanksgiving dinner,\nand hesitate just a little,\nbut eat it anyway because\nnothing can take that peri-peri pleasure away from\nyou. I guess it\u2019s common\nknowledge that burnt foods\ncan be carcinogenic, but did\nyou know that different burnt\nfoods pose different levels of\ndanger?\nFoods cooked at high\ntemperatures for too long end\nup harbouring a molecule\ncalled \u2018acrylamide\u2019. Although\nit is known to be a toxin, the\nlink between consuming it in\nfood and developing cancer\nis less clear. Acrylamide\nitself is formed in a reaction\nbetween the naturally occurring amino acid asparagine,\nand carbohydrates. It does\nnot matter whether or not the\nfood is organic, but there is a\ndefinite correlation between\nhigh temperatures and acryla-mide formation. That aside,\na review in 2015 showed\nthat \u201cdietary acrylamide\u201d is\nnot related to the risk of the\nmost common cancers; but\na modest association with\nkidney, endometrial and ovarian cancers in people who\nhad never smoked, couldn\u2019t\nbe ruled out. Interestingly,\nrecent studies have proven\nthat acrylamide formation\nis associated more with\ncarbohydrates rather than\nprotein-rich foods, such as\nwe grill and fry because these\nfoods just taste better, flavour\ndeepens with the smoky kiss\nof the flame, but this doesn\u2019t\nmean you should eliminate\nthese methods from your\nSaturday night repertoire\naltogether. Heavens no.\nThe general rule of thumb is\nto stop grilling or barbecuing once food has turned\ngolden-brown\u2013 at this point\nthe meal is cooked enough\nto stop you getting food\npoisoning, but not cooked too\nlong where potential cancer\nrisk could increase. Since\nacrylamide does not form in\nfruits and vegetables, that are\nfurthermore less likely to have\nthese adverse reactions pop\nup when in contact with direct\nheat anyway, perhaps there\u2019s\na silver lining to all this, and\nall you have to do is eat more\nof the (healthy) rainbow.\nThat way, things are easier.\nIt\u2019s up to you to find the right\nbalance.\npasta, bread or potatoes, that\nare fried, baked or roasted\nat temperatures above 120\ndegrees Celsius.\nHold on just a second,\nthough. Although acrylamide\nis more likely to occur in these\nfoods, it has also been shown\nthat meat tends to harbour\nother more dangerous com-pounds. These generally fall\ninto two classes: PAHs (poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons)\nand HCAs (heterocyclic\namines). Studies have shown\nthere could indeed be a link\nbetween frying or barbecuing meat and a higher risk of\ncancer, because these cooking techniques increase the\nformation of PAHs and HCAs.\nThe takeaway from the\njumble of acronyms and\nacrylamide? Watch how you\ncook, be it carbohydrate, fat\nor protein. Turn your meat\non the grill regularly, and try\nroasting or microwaving your\nfood more often. Of course\nDoes this look burnt?\nO\nf the many\nthings\nyou might\nhave been\nsweeping\noff your\nbalconies and terraces,\ncosmic dust particles could\nhave found their way in\nyour dust pan. Cosmic dust\ngrains are minute particles\nmeasuring around 0.01\nmillimetres in size and are\nremnants from the time our\nsolar system was born. They\ncontain traces of minerals and\nanalysing it can help scientists\nto solve the puzzle of how\nthe entire solar system was\nformed.\nUntil now, scientists\ncollected cosmic dust from\neasier for them to separate it\nfrom dust of less extravagant\norigin.\nNearly five hundred cosmic\ndust particles were retrieved,\nand not only that, but they\nwere also found to vary in\nsize and structure from the\nones previously recovered\nfrom Antarctica. The cosmic\ndust collected from the cities\ncontained fewer feather-like\nstructured crystals than those\nfound in samples collected\nfrom Antarctica, that accumulated a million years ago.\nThis change, the scientists say,\nis due to the slight shifts in\nthe orbits of the planets over\nthe last one million years.\nThough the changes in the\norbits appear to be small,\nthe frozen areas around\nthe ice caps and deep in\noceans, as these places\nhardly experience the kind\nof terrestrial disturbance and\npollution cities do. However,\nfor the first time, Dr. Matthew\nGenge from Imperial College\nLondon, and his associate\namateur researcher Jon\nLarsen from Project Stardust,\nNorway, have demonstrated that it is possible to\ncollect cosmic dust particles in\ncities. The science duo went\nthrough the mammoth task of\nsifting nearly 300 kilograms\nof debris from rooftops of\nbuildings in Paris, Oslo and\nBerlin. Using the magnetic\nproperties of minerals found\nin the cosmic dust made it\nCosmic dust in your backyard\nF\nact: We contains\nmore DNA that\nmakes viruses than\nDNA that makes\nhumans.\nNo, this isn\u2019t\ntalking about Mr Smith\u2019s\nfamous quote about how\nhumans are more like viruses\nthan mammals. 5-8% of all\nhuman DNA contains genes\nthat make virus proteins,\nwhile only ~1.5% of human\nDNA contains genes that\nmake human proteins.\nThis is because viruses like\nHIV (called retroviruses)\nshoe-horn their DNA into\nours while infecting us. However, sometimes this DNA\n\u2018forgets\u2019 how to leave the\ngenome, and so gets stuck in\namongst our DNA.\nOccasionally, this will\nhappen in a sperm or an\negg, and even more occasionally that sperm or egg\nwill be fertilized and make\na whole new human. That\nchild will therefore have\nthat virus DNA in every\nsingle cell in their body.\nCrucially, they will have it\nin their sperm or eggs, and\nso if they have kids they will\ndefinitely pass it on.\nAncient viruses have done\nthis millions of times, and\nso many of them are still\nkicking around that we are\nat least 5 times more a virus\nthan we are a human. Luckily, they are all stuck where\nthey are, so the chances\nof you dying of some\nmillion-year-old plague or\nsomething are pretty slim.\nMankind\nis a virus\nAnother one of Mr. Aran\nShaunak\u2019s Little Bites of\nScience\n@BitesOfScience\nthey cause disturbances\nin the gravitational forces\nexerted by the planets. This\nin turn changes the trajectory\nand the speed at which the\ncosmic dust particles whizz\nthrough space. As cosmic\nparticles enter the earth\u2019s\natmosphere, they get heated\nup and changes occur in their\nshape and size. This helps\nin calculating the speed at\nwhich the cosmic dust particles travel. Genge and Larsen\nbelieve the cosmic particles\nthey collected from the cities\ntravelled at a speed of 12\nkm/s, making them the fastest\nparticles on Earth.\nIpsita Herlekar\n\n"

Blah.Blah.Blah\nfelixonline.co. uk /comment comment.felix@ic.ac.uk\nC O M M E N T\nThe Looming\nClimate Crisis,\nCOP 21, and the\nWill to Survive\nJawaad Farooq looks to the future of\ncombatting climate change.\nT\nhis week a\npositive 20\u00b0C\nair temperature\nanomaly has been\nrecorded over the\nArctic Ocean. With\nsea temperatures averaging\naround 4\u00b0C higher than\nis usual for October and\nNovember, it looks like we are\nset to see more extreme effects\nof climate change in the near\nfuture.\nWith these alarming indicators and the Paris climate\nchange deal where 200 nations reached an agreement\nto limit global warming to\n2\u00b0C, you would assume the\nworld is moving in the general\ndirection of taking this threat\nseriously and putting more resources at the disposal of the\nagencies that are equipped to\ndeal with this.\nWith Trump\u2019s decision to\nstrip NASA\u2019s earth science division of its funding, however,\nwe are seeing the first signs of\nhis anti-climate change stance\ncoming into play. Following\non from his other tentative\nreversals, he has conceded\nthat there may be some \u2018linkage\u2019 between climate change\nand human activity. That is\na big jump from it being a\nChinese conspiracy against\nAmerican businesses, but his\nactions are more important\nthan words here. The focus apparently should be on \u2018deep\nspace research\u2019 according to\nBob Walker, a senior Trump\nadvisor. While deep space\nmay provide a distraction to\nthe general populations from\nwoes closer to home, a focus\non the earth and its functions is\nessentially important if we are\nto manage our impact on the\nplanet.\nThe USA has been the world\u2019s\npoliceman for some time, and\na word from the US is taken\nseriously; however, Trump\u2019s\nactions may signal a shift from\nleading the fight against climate change towards a more\napathetic stance. This is not\nwhat the world needs. The US\nalong with Chinese cooperation made the Paris climate\ntalks a success. The $100bn\nclimate fund the UN promised\nto make available to poorer\ncountries to spend in combating climate change is a vital\nasset. Only 8% of this pledge\nhas been funded, however,\nwith the US contributing only\n$500m of its $3bn pledge so\nfar and there is worry that further funds will not materialise\nunder a Trump government.\nThe idea of political will is im-portant. For the Paris climate\ntalks each country submitted\na plan called a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)\nwhich outlined the part their\ncountry would play in mitigating climate change; how-ever, the global sum total of\nthese contributions far overreached past the 2\u00b0C threshold that was agreed. Each\ncountry must therefore submit\na more ambitious plan every\nfive years. For these plans to\nbe followed through, political\nwill is necessary. When there\nis momentum, people are willing to join the cause. When it\ndies down, countries may not\nfeel the need to devote time to\nsomething others do not care\nmuch about. A joint statement\nwas released by 47 countries\nmost vulnerable to climate\nchange stating that by 2050\nthey would attempt to get all\ntheir energy from renewable\nresources. Some may speculate at whether this is realis-tic, but what it does represent\nis the political will. A pull out\nfrom the cause of a major\ncountry like the US could potentially damage the will to\ndeliver.\nAlthough, maybe we don\u2019t\nneed to worry as much. There\nare obviously those who think\nthat the best kind of restrictions\non fossil fuel burning are free\nmarket forces. When cheaper\nalternatives are found natu-rally, they will supersede fossil fuels as the fuel of choice.\nEconomic barriers stick while\ngovernment rules and carbon\ntaxes are an inefficient way\nof enforcing limits on carbon\nemissions. With that said it is\nnecessary for us to limit the\nemissions to below 2\u00b0C warming in any way possible. Reopening coal mines, as Trump\nhas suggested, does not make\nsense economically as cleaner\nalternatives become cheaper.\nIn 2015, emissions were down\n12% from what they were in\nthe previous decade, and this\nhas been attributed to the increasing use of shale gas over\ncoal.\nAt the same time renewable\ntechnologies are becoming\ncheaper and more accessible.\nThe cost of batteries is one-fifth\nof what they were in 2008,\nwhile efficiency has quadru-pled. And with China looking\nto become a powerhouse in\nproducing renewable technol-ogies, the possibility of China\nleading the way is potentially\na real one. It has its own reasons as well. Pollution in major\nChinese cities is a pandemic\ncausing around 1.6m people\nto die each year.\nOne writer in the Guardian\nhad a more pessimistic tone.\nNot only is the economic\nmodel of the world outdated\nwith blue collar jobs heading\ntowards automation, but our\nframe of mind to deal with\nthis problem is outmoded and\nthus disaster is a certainty. We\nshould all prepare for war.\nMy thoughts are ambiguous:\ncountries across the world are\nwaking up to the understanding that things need to change\nbecause for the most part it is\na matter of their own survival.\nThe argument really is whether we are working fast enough\nand right now, we are not.\nOnce certain climate tipping\npoints are reached, there is no\ngoing back.\nTrump\u2019s climate policies certainly take us backwards, but\nthe rest of the world will not\nsimply give up on the idea of\nlimiting climate change. Until\nthen, however, a lack of glacial water feeding into dams is\ncausing drought in Bolivia and\nArctic ice continues to melt\naway. We must not let our will\nfor change melt away as well.\n\\\\ With Trump\u2019s\ndecision to strip\nNASA\u2019s earth\nscience division of\nits funding, however,\nwe are seeing the\nfirst signs of his\nanti-climate change\nstance coming into\nplay \\\\\n\\\\ Trump\u2019s actions may\nsignal a shift from leading\nthe fight against climate\nchange towards a more\napathetic stance. This is not\nwhat the world needs \\\\\n\\\\ Pollution in major\nChinese cities is a\npandemic causing\naround 1.6m people\nto die each year \\\\\nFake news: you\nwon\u2019t believe\nwhat I think!\nSteve Bohnel is opinionated about fake\nnews\nI\nf you\u2019ve read my comment\npieces in this paper\naround the time of the\nAmerican election, then\nyou know two facts: first,\nI\u2019m American, and second,\nI\u2019m pretty opinionated about\nour political landscape and\nhow polarized it\u2019s seemingly\nbecome.\nNow, during recent weeks,\nmore articles have been written about the rise of one of\nthe main areas that may have\ndrastically helped Trump win\nthe presidency: fake news.\nWhile there is a political con-nection, I\u2019m here to argue\nthat, while it has become\nmore inflated during the past\nyear, this phenomenon has\nbeen a problem in the past.\nFor instance, Alex Jones,\nthe host of his own radio\nshow and a founder of the\nwebsite Infowars, spends a\nlot of time presenting \u2018fake\nnews\u2019 to the general public.\nJones has more than a million likes on his Facebook\npage and over 490,000 Twitter followers, so it seems he\nhas a decent following. Of\nall the craziness that this man\ncomes out with, nothing may\nbe worse than his belief that\nthe Sandy Hook shooting \u2013\nwhere 20 schoolchildren and\nsix staff members were shot\nat a Connecticut elementary\nschool \u2013 was a hoax, staged\nwith actors. It\u2019s disturbing\nand insensitive to those impacted by the shooting. And\nit\u2019s downright scary that people believe what Jones is say-ing.\nTo explain to you how dangerous this mindset is, I\u2019ve\nhad an extensive reporting\nbackground, writing more\nthan 200 articles for my\nschool paper back home,\nalong with interning for Philadelphia\u2019s two major papers\nfor nearly seven months. As\na journalist, I will confirm\nthat mistakes are made \u2013\nand when they happen, I\u2019ve\nfelt pretty crappy. But it\u2019s one\nthing to make a mistake. It\u2019s\nanother to intentionally mislead the public by reporting\nwithout any conclusive facts\nor evidence.\nWe\u2019re not rocket scientists.\nBut reporters have the great\nprivilege of being granted\naccess to interviews with\nprominent public figures,\nalong with the excuse to\nknock on random doors on\nthe street to try to uncover a\nstory. \u2018Fake news\u2019 is not only\na disservice to the public, it\nalso damages the credibility\nthat honest reporters strive\nfor on a daily basis. On the\nother end of this issue, we as\nconsumers must be mindful of\nwhat we are seeing on social\nmedia, and whether it is credible or not. As a reporter, this\nadmittedly comes as second\nnature, but even I have been\nduped from time to time because of how credible an\narticle may appear. And un-fortunately, kids my age do\nhave a tough time deciphering what is credible and what\nisn\u2019t.\nA couple of weeks ago, NPR\nreported on a study completed by researchers at Stanford University investigating\nwhether middle school, high\nschool and college students\ncould identify different factors differentiating fake news\nreports from real ones. The\nresearchers were \u201cshocked\u201d\nat the results, one of which\nshowed that more than 30%\nof high schoolers thought a\nfake Fox News Twitter account was more credible\nthan the real one carrying\nthe blue verified tick next to\nits name.\nIt should be noted that this\nwas only one study at one\nuniversity. But if those results\nare reflected in even a minor\nway across the United States\nand other first world coun-tries, that\u2019s scary. What\u2019s\nperhaps most troubling about\nthis rise of \u2018fake news\u2019 is why\naudiences are seemingly demanding it. Is it because they\nlike what they are reading?\nDoes it reaffirm their beliefs?\nIf so, when did basic journalistic principles like checking\nsources, reporting facts, and\ntrying to be as objective and\nbalanced as possible stop\nmattering to the general pub-lic?\nAs cynical as I am, I do\nbelieve there are enough intelligent people out there to\nrealise when they are reading an illegitimate source.\nThe problem is that some of\nthese fake articles are really\ndeceptive. For example, native advertising appears like\na general article at first, until the end when you realise\nwhat you\u2019ve been reading is\nfocused around a specific TV\nshow, product, or service.\nPerhaps more important-ly, I do not think \u2018fake news\u2019\nswayed our election, as some\npeople say. Trump got a considerable amount of free air-time, and as I said before,\nsome voters just hated Clinton so much they decided\nTrump \u2013 as irrational as it\nseems \u2013 was the lesser of two\nevils.\n\u2018Fake news\u2019 does deceive,\nthough, and news sites like\nBreitbart and Infowars are\nextremely dangerous when it\ncomes to the freedom of the\npress of my country. Our first\namendment is a great privilege in my society, and serious journalists don\u2019t take that\nresponsibility lightly.\nAnd yes, while the sites I\nlisted are both right-wing,\nI will admit the media does\nlean left. That being said, we\ndon\u2019t have the nerve to suggest that the shooting of 20\nschoolchildren was staged.\nThat part of this issue is something I will maybe never com-prehend.\n\\\\ It\u2019s one thing to\nmake a mistake.\nIt\u2019s another to\nintentionally mislead\nthe public \\\\\n\\\\ Fake news is not only a\ndisservice to the public, it\nalso damages the credibility\nthat honest reporters strive\nfor on a daily basis \\\\\n\\\\ When did basic\njournalistic principles\nlike checking\nsources, reporting\nfacts, and trying\nto be as objective\nas possible stop\nmattering to the\ngeneral public? \\\\\n\n"

The\nhosts retain their signature\nirreverence, although they\ndo seem a bit more haggard\nthan usual. Thankfully though,\ndespite going international,\nClarkson, May, and Hammond retain their Britishness\nand British sense of humour.\nAt first, it seems as if they\u2019re\nstruggling to adapt to the\nnew format, but they quickly\nfall into the old grooves that\nmade them so successful in\nthe first place.\nDespite its flaws, The Grand\nTour is an amicable successor\nto the Top Gear of old. It\ncertainly blows Chris Evans\u2019\nmonstrosity out of the water.\n\\\\ The real fun is in\nseeing the different\ncharacters interact\n\\\\\nsimple; aliens come to Earth\nand to combat them, the Flash\nbrings all his allies together.\nIt\u2019s always nice to see a\nvibrant and energetic adven-ture, especially considering\nthat Snyder\u2019s upcoming Justice League movie is expected\nto have his usual dark and\ngritty style.\nAs in any superhero team\nup, the real fun is seeing the\ndifferent characters interact\nand watching their personalities clash. Whether it was\nCisco and Felicity geeking out\nover a time ship, Supergirl\nH\naving four shows\nset in a shared\nuniverse and\non the same\nchannel meant\na crossover was\ninevitable. It was certainly\nambitious, especially on a TV\nnetwork budget, but I\u2019m glad\nto say they were able to pull\nit off.\nWith a diverse range of\ncharacters from DC comics,\nthe crossover is essentially a\nJustice League movie. They\neven have their own Hall of\nJustice! The plot was fairly\nand Heatwave\u2019s brief but\nhilarious interactions, or\nFlash and Arrow drinking\ntogether and bonding over\ntheir experiences, there was\nnever a dull moment. One\ncritique was taking the focus\noff Supergirl in the later act of\nstory. I hope that, later down\nin the road, the producers\nmake a smaller scale crosso-ver, just to see more banter\nbetween the heroes.\nA problem with crossovers\nis that they usually put the\nheroes\u2019 individual stories\naside to focus on the larger\npicture. While the invasion\nwas the major feature here,\nthe episodes were still written\nto allow some individuality\nin each of them. Arrow\u2019s\nepisode in particular barely\nfeatured the crossover,\ninstead telling the usual story\nof the hero being placed in a\nperfect life scenario. The episode worked better for it, with\nsome tear jerking scenes and\na great look at seeing how\nfar the characters of Arrow\nhad come.\nThe overarching invasion\nstoryline starts off a little slow\ncase. The action sequences\nwere on point and impressive\nduring the climactic scenes,\nwith dozens of heroes and\naliens fighting while Flash and\nSupergirl raced across the\nEarth. Just seeing a massive\nline-up of DC icons standing\ntogether was thrilling, in and\nof itself.\nThough there might have\nbeen a few hiccups along\nthe way, the crossover ultimately made great use of the\npremise and exceeded all\nexpectations. The only thing\nyou\u2019ll be wondering once\nyou\u2019ve watched it is when the\nnext one will be.\nbut kicks into gear in the final\nact. The aliens are actually\ngiven motivations and aren\u2019t\njust portrayed as stereotypical bad guys, as is usually the\nInvasion!\nSaad Ahmed\nAnurag Deshpande\n\\\\ Despite its flaws,\nThe Grand Tour is\nan amicable successor to the Top Gear\nof old \\\\\nas the show still seems very\nmuch geared to a traditional\nprimetime TV format.\nAlso, I hate the new track\ndriver. Clearly brought\non board in some sort of\nvain attempt to draw in\nthe American audiences,\nthis ex-NASCAR driver\u2019s\ngrating feigns at comedy are\nfrequently frustrating and\nalways atrocious.\nHowever, The Grand Tour\nis not without its charms and,\nin general, it delivers on its\npromise of being a grander\nT\nop Gear is dead. Long\nLive Top Gear? Following\nJeremy Clarkson\u2019s, lets\nface it, rightful dismissal\nfrom the BBC and the\nsubsequent decline of\nTop Gear\u2019s quality, fans have been\nhanging their hopes on The Grand\nTour. Thankfully, the new series\ndoes not disappoint. Well, mostly.\nThe series begins with an\nextended, tongue-in-cheek\nsegment that sets the tone for the\nshow: bigger, more expensive, and\njust a little bloated. No attempts\nare made to disguise the fact that\nit\u2019s meant to be a Top Gear killer.\nEven the logo itself is a \u2018GT\u2019, a\nreversal of Top Gear.\nThe new shtick is essentially an\nattempt to emulate the successes of\nthe Top Gear specials, with each\nepisode taking place in a different\ncountry, and having a different\ntheme.\nThat\u2019s part of the problem. A\nlarge part of the charm of those\nspecials was organic, coming from\nthe hosts interactions. Here, too\nmuch scripting is used in a hollow\nattempt to replicate those highs. As\na result, jokes often overstay their\nwelcome and clearly staged\ninteractions become obvious\nand unfunny.\nThe team are starting to\nshow their age a bit as well,\nNew team, same as the old team \\\\\nAmazon Studios\nCheap spandex has never looked so\niconic \\\\ The CW\nThe Grand\nTour\n\n"

What has the reaction been to\na degree that has severely cut face-to-face teaching?\nI don\u2019t know enough about that so I have to be careful not to be\ntalking for them. I just know what they want to do and I\u2019ve seen an\noutline of a plan. It\u2019s one of those things that I\u2019d like to support them in\nso we make sure that it actually influences the student experience in a\ngood way. Online learning needs to always follow from the strategy\nand it\u2019s not a way of saving time \u2013 it almost never is. There\u2019s so\nmany things you can do with online pedagogy that can help the\nstudent experience\nWith online technology, you can take the lecturing out of the\ncurriculum in the traditional way, with the professor in front of\nthe class and you can videotape that, make students watch it\nat home and you use the classroom time for other things. So\nif you use that [classroom time] well and build on that lecture\nthat they\u2019ve watched at home then you can actually increase\nthe learning and give the students a much more positive,\nengaging experience.\nAnd doing online things doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s not\nengaging, because in smaller groups students can peer review each\nother\u2019s work, teachers can be part of that too and we will always need\nthe actual physical experience. But it\u2019s best if you do that in a more\nengaging way. It\u2019s almost like a waste of everybody\u2019s time if you use the\nphysical, on-campus experience in this traditional lecture style. I think\nthat\u2019s what online learning is about. How can you enhance the student\nexperience?\nYou guys tend to break up the categorisation of different types of\nlearning into seminars and lectures etc., and then in independent\nlearning. So in this particular case, for example, 17% would be seminars\nand lectures and the rest of the course would be independent learning.\nA lot of people will look at it and ask, \u201cWait a minute, if I\u2019m spending\nthe majority of my degree learning independently, why do I need to\ncome here, why do I need to pay \u00a39,000 a year?\u201d\nAgain I\u2019m not commenting on this particular degree because I really\ndon\u2019t know what they will be doing.\nI think students are traditionally very conservative because they don\u2019t\nknow what it\u2019s like when things change. They\u2019re critical of different\nways of teaching. You need to explain to them why you\u2019re\nchanging things and what they\u2019ll get out of a different way of\nteaching. But in general i think having 100% not independent\nlearning is not the modern way of teaching. And I think 30%\nof independent learning is not that much. So what students\nneed to do is they need to learn independently. They need\nto build the skills to find information on their own, to compile\ninformation on their own to actually start working with the\nfacts. If you use all teaching for facts students will never go\nbeyond that.\nWhere do we draw the line? In Biology for example 80% of\nthe course is independent learning. Is it worth the hype?\nWe shouldn\u2019t necessarily confuse contact with one professor in front\nof the whole group with value for money and it\u2019s very important that\nboth students and staff think about what students should get out of their\ntime at imperial and do that as well as possible. I personally think that\nsitting quietly in a room where you get taught stuff by someone isn\u2019t the\nbest value for money. And if 20% is that kind of teaching and 80% is\nother stuff I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with it if that\u2019s a ratio that\nhas come out of careful thinking.\nBack to the NSS scores: there is a lag factor, are you preparing for the\npossibility of our score continuing the tumble?\nI would love for our NSS scores to improve, because it\u2019s also part of\nthe TEF (Teaching Excellence Framework), but I don\u2019t want to do this\njust for the NSS. We want to change our curriculum, our pedagogy, our\nstudent experience to make it fit for a purpose in the 21st\ncentury and I\nthink as a fringe benefit at some point we\u2019ll see our NSS score go up.\nBut it\u2019s not the other way round.\nHaving said that do you not find there\u2019s a lot of pressure at the moment\nto do as much as possible to improve the scores due to the current\npolitical climate? With everything going on I can imagine everyone\nin college is panicking. We need to improve or lose the ability to\nrecruit international students.\nI think we just need to keep our calm and be really British.\nWhat is it \u2013 \u2018Keep calm and carry on\u2019? I don\u2019t think we should\nget into panic mode and try to do quick fixes just because\nwe\u2019re worried about our position in the rankings. I think\nthere\u2019s enough of a problem with the NSS that could make\nus do things that we don\u2019t really want to do. We know some\nstudents like easy courses and predictable exams etc. But you\ndon\u2019t want to make your course so easy that your students will\nlove them when you\u2019re not actually teaching them anything. So\nsometimes having very challenging curriculums may lead to lower\nscores. If that\u2019s what we feel the students need we should be able\nto give that to them. We need to be careful not to be following surveys\nthat are inherently not perfect in something as important as the strategy\nto improve learning.\nI guess that\u2019s the main concern. If the interest that college has exhibited\nin improving is not genuine and is fuelled by wishing to merely improve\nthe NSS scores, the changes that will be implemented...\nThey\u2019re not sustainable, exactly. They may be the wrong ones and\nthey may not be sustainable. My conviction is that if we do this seriously\nevidence based, thorough, with students, with the right outcomes in\nmind, go through all our curriculums, make sure that they\u2019re right, that\nwill be reflected in the NSS scores at some point as well. It would be\ndaft to do it the other way round.\nIf this doesn\u2019t happen, if we struggle to show that we\u2019re a top university,\nif we\u2019re not allowed to bring is as many international students, what will\nthe effect be?\nThat would be really bad, but there\u2019s lots of ifs in that sentence\nand I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. If we\u2019re really serious\nabout this strategy, if we communicate it, if the world starts to\nfind out that really exciting stuff is happening at Imperial I\nthink we\u2019ll actually be ok. I\u2019m convinced that in three to five\nyears we could really be leading in evidence based STEM\neducation that\u2019s modern and technology driven.\nIt\u2019s definitely a race against time though, what with Brexit\nlooming over us. If our strategy is really long-term, there\nare real effects in the near future that might Impact Imperial.\nWhat\u2019s the contingency plan?\nWe\u2019re doing everything we can. Alice is constantly in the\nnewspapers talking about visas and the effects of lowering the\nnumber of international students. I think we\u2019re doing a really good\njob in explaining why this would be a bad thing. But there\u2019s only so\nmuch you can do. Panic is never a good thing, It\u2019s never good to do\nshort term fixes because you\u2019re afraid of what may happen. It need\nto be serious, sustainable. I\u2019m an optimist and always really positive\nbut I\u2019m also a realist. I\u2019m pretty sure that if we\u2019re going to do what\nwe\u2019re promising and if we\u2019re really going to take student experience\nand education seriously and modernise the experience in an evidence\nbased way, I think that\u2019s going to help us in our branding, in the way\nwe\u2019re being perceived by the world. And I think we\u2019re really going to\nbe able to attract good students and we\u2019re more likely to win a battle\nwith the Government if that comes, if we show them we\u2019re really serious\nabout education, than if we just do quick patch up work that people will\njust see through. We have to continue feeling confident and calm and\nthinking \u2018Hey you know, we\u2019re Imperial\u2019 [laughs].\n\\\\ It\u2019s almost\nlike a waste of\neverybody\u2019s time if you\nuse the physical, on-campus\nexperience in this traditional\nlecture style. I think that\u2019s\nwhat online learning is\nabout \\\\\n\\\\ Rob Deutscher\nfelix talks NSS and Imperial\u2019s teaching\nstrategy plans with VP for Education\nSimone Buitendijk talks online learning, Brexit and more\nLef Apostolakis\nI\u2019m going to be working on it this fall and spring so up until Christmas\ntime we\u2019re going to be talking to lots of people. We have popup stands, we have town hall meetings, so we\u2019ll be gathering\ninformation and listening to students and staff and we\u2019re\nalready getting lots of really thoughtful comments. It\u2019s really\ngreat, I\u2019m very happy with the way it\u2019s going.\nAnd then we\u2019ll need January, February, March and part\nof April to put that into a comprehensive plan, with a\nbudget and that needs to be in time for a planning round\nbecause a lot of what we\u2019re going to be doing is not just\nthinking about new pedagogies, new ways of teaching,\nnew ways of making students aware that we\u2019re at a\nresearch intensive university, trawling them into research.\nIt\u2019s also about how to do that: how to make change happen\nin a place that\u2019s so decentralised.\nThere are lot\u2019s of things happening that no one knows of and\nif you want to make big changes you need to make sure you\nmake people aware of this central strategy and make sure that it\ngets translated to the lower levels. And it means people need time and\nsupport and hence money to actually go through with the change.\nChange always costs time and Imperial staff and students are already\nworking so hard. I can\u2019t ask them to do a little bit more without making\nsure that they can give up something to focus on the changes.\nSo you\u2019re hoping by the end of this academic year to have a budget\nfor departments to dip in and try and elevate their teaching. When\ndo you think we\u2019re going to start seeing the first overhauls of teaching\nstructure at IC?\nI think we\u2019re already going to be seeing little things this academic\nyear, because I have the endowment that Alice [Gast] has graciously\ngiven part of for teaching and research innovation. So we\u2019re having a\ncall for proposals now for inovation in teaching and people can ask for\nup to \u00a315,000 which is quite a bit of money. Well it\u2019s not that much but\ncompared to what they were given in the past it is quite a bit of money.\nHow much were they given in the past?\nWell, pretty much nothing. There was never a call for\nproposals of this size. So I know there quite a few groups\nthat are excited and are right now thinking up plans. So\nthey can start this Spring with innovation. And then of\ncourse there is the online learning innovation which we\u2019re\nalso going to be seed funding this academic year. So I think\nwe\u2019ll see the first changes in the spring of 2017 and then the\nbigger ones next academic year.\nWe\u2019ve maybe spotted one of your big overhauls. In the next\nacademic year The Biomedical Science degree is going to be\ntransformed into a Medical Bioscience degree and one of the\nmajor changes is more online learning. One of the changes that\nhas come under scrutiny is that time allocated to lectures and seminars\nwill only be 17% of the degree, probably one of the smallest time\nSo I guess we should probably start by welcoming you to Imperial.\nHow are you finding it so far?\nIt\u2019s amazing, I\u2019m having a great time. It\u2019s the best job I\u2019ve\nhad ever I think, at least that\u2019s what it feels like right now, it\u2019s\nonly been four months.\nThere\u2019s a lot that needs to be done, which of course is\ngreat. I\u2019m not the kind of person who likes sitting still and\nnot achieving goals. It\u2019s great.\nIt\u2019s a very interesting time for you to come here because\nwe have this new strategy from 2015 and the new NSS\nscores that haven\u2019t exactly been a pleasant surprise, and\nthen of course there\u2019s Brexit. So how are you finding the\nchallenge so far?\nI like a good challenge and Imperial is a wonderful place.\nThe students are amazing and there is so much knowledge and\nenthusiasm from staff, there is so much material to work with and so if\nthat\u2019s the starting point for a challenge...\nThat\u2019s true and Imperial students can be quite opinionated especially\nwhen it comes to their course as the NSS scores have shown. We\nhave consistently been doing poorly in a number of areas including\nAssessment, Feedback and Support, with variation in Teaching Quality\nas well. Do you have any insight so far into why that is?\nWell, especially for Feedback and Assessment, what I found really\nilluminating about the NSS results were the qualitative bits, where\npeople wrote little stories, because that tells you a lot \u2013 it gives a depth\nto the quantitative scores. And in terms of the Feedback and Assessment\nI think there are quick wins that we can do and are actually doing right\nnow to change things.\nOne of the things lots of students talk about is the zero tolerance\npolicy for handing in coursework. So if they\u2019re two minutes late they\nget zero points but then lecturers and teachers go over deadlines\nand don\u2019t seem to adhere to similar standards. I think it\u2019s those\nkinds of things that are really difficult to accept and I totally\nunderstand that.\nAnd one thing I think that\u2019s hard at Imperial is we have\npockets of excellence \u2013 there are lots of people who\u2019ve\nbeen working very hard and are doing excellent teaching\nand providing an excellent student experience but it\u2019s\nnot everywhere, it\u2019s not across the board. And students\ntalk to each other, they talk in halls, they talk to students\nfrom other universities in London, even in the rest of the\ncountry and they compare. And when you can\u2019t explain as\na university why certain students have a great experience\nand others don\u2019t then you get this kind of disgruntlement.\nYou talk about refining the 2015/2020 teaching strategy. Is there\na time frame for when we can start to expect changes?\n\\\\ We\u2019re having a call for\nproposals now for inovation\nin teachign and people\ncan ask for up to \u00a315,000\nwhich is quite a bit of\nmoney \\\\\n\\\\ Imperial College\n\n"

In our new\nweekly feature, we examine some of the\nartists whose antics regularly embarrass\ntheir fans. Can we separate the music\nfrom the artist? First up is German singer,\nNico.\nFred Fyles\nM\ny\nproblematic\nfave is the\nGermanborn singer\nNico, who\nfound fame as a Warhol\nSuperstar, working with\nThe Velvet Underground\non their debut album. She\nthen went on to discover\nthe harmonium and make a\nseries of experimental albums\nthat have only recently\nbegun to be recognised for\nthe masterpieces they are.\nNico\u2019s work is Gothic in the\ntrue sense of the word: her\nicy, deep vocals, chillingly\naccented by the sound of\nslow progressions on the\nharmonium, feel like a cold\nwind blowing through the\ncrypt of a cathedral, all dust\nand rust and power.\nNico was also, unfor-tunately, deeply racist.\nJournalist Danny Fields, who\nhelped Nico sign to Elektra\nRecords \u2013 with whom she\nwould make the 1968 LP The\nMarble Index \u2013 described her\nas \u2018Nazi-esque\u2019, saying that\n\u2018She had a definite Nordic\nAryan streak, [the belief] that\nshe was physically, spiritually\nand creatively superior.\u2019 Her\nbehaviour supports this opin-ion: at a Berlin concert she\nangered the crowd by singing\nthe German national anthem\n\u2018Das Leid der Deutschen\u2019,\nincluding the verses usually\nomitted for its nationalist\nconnotations; and \u2013 according again to Fields \u2013 there\nwas an incident in the early\n1970s when Nico smashed\na glass in a mixed-race\nwoman\u2019s eye, whilst saying \u2018I\nhate black people\u2019. Nico died\nin 1988, at the young age of\n49, missing the internet age\nof \u2018problematic faves\u2019, but\nany admirer of her music must\nconfront her racist worldview.\nHowever, I think it is remiss\nnot to look at how Nico\u2019s\nracism developed. She was\nborn Christa P\u00e4ffgen in\nCologne in 1938, a mere\nfive months after Austria\nwas annexed. Her father\nsustained head injuries after\nbeing enlisted in the army,\nand ended his life in a psychiatric hospital. Christa and\nher mother fled to the suburbs\nof Berlin while Cologne\nwas hit with bombing raids;\nits population decimated.\nFollowing the fall of Hitler,\nher early Nazi-informed\nworldview inevitably came\nup against the blunt reality\nof life in Allied-occupied\nGermany. At the age of 15,\nwhen working as a temp for\nthe US Air Force, she was\nraped by an African-American GI, who had also raped\na number of other employees;\noriginally keeping quiet about\nit, the crime was eventually\ndiscovered, and Christa was\nmade to give evidence. He\nwas sentenced to death, and\nshot.\nAnd this is why I think the\nterm \u2018problematic\u2019 is a poor\nchoice to use when describing\nNico. How can it encompass\nthe entirety of her traumatic\nupbringing? A war that left\nher father dead by his own\nhand; a childhood spent in\nbombed-out cities; an adolescence marked by being raped\nand then indicted in her\nrapist\u2019s killing. While these\nfactors don\u2019t excuse her racist\nbehaviour, they can explain\nit in a way that merely calling\nNico \u2018problematic fave\u2019 can\nnever do.\nThe word \u2018problematic\u2019 has,\nlike \u2018liberal elite\u2019 or \u2018will of the\npeople\u2019, today just become\nanother meaningless buzzword in our online lexicon.\nIt smooths away all the tricky\ncomplexities of the power\nstructures inherent within\nsociety, leaving no room for\nnuance; by calling someone\nor something \u2018problematic\u2019,\nwhat we are really doing,\ndeep down, is emphasising\nthat we are not. We place\nthe onus of responsibility for\n\\\\ I think it\u2019s remiss\nnot to look at\nhow Nico\u2019s racism\ndeveloped \\\\\nbehaviour entirely on the\nindividual person, and refuse\nto critically examine the structural issues at hand.\nTo me, calling Nico a \u2018problematic fave\u2019, and leaving it\nat that, is a double injustice: it\ndoesn\u2019t do justice to her tragic\nlife story, one pockmarked\nby suffering and strife, and\nit doesn\u2019t do justice to those\nmost affected by racism, since\nit refuses to challenge the\nstatus quo at a level higher\nthan the individual. It exonerates us from the responsibility\nof interrogating the structural\nproblems that lead to some\nparts of society profiting at\nthe expense of others.\nCan we separate the artist\nfrom the art? I\u2019m not really\nsure if this is possible or not.\nBut what I am sure about is\nthat I will continue to enjoy\nNico\u2019s work, despite her\n\u2018problematic\u2019 aspects. I will\ncontinue to feel chills down\nmy spine at her raw interpretation of The Doors\u2019 \u2018The\nEnd\u2019; I will continue to skip the\ntracks on \u2018The Velvet Underground and Nico\u2019 that don\u2019t\nfeature her teutonic vocals\n(soz Lou Reed); and I will continue to feel a discomforting\nmixture of sadness and hope\nduring the beautifully-sim-ple song \u2018Afraid\u2019. Nico\u2019s art\nstretches far beyond a couple\nof songs on a Warhol-produced LP, and the structural\nracism that is entrenched in\nsociety stretches far beyond\nthe short pithy syllables of\n\u2018problematic\u2019.\nAbove: GanMed64, Below: Steven Depolo\\\\\nSo it\u2019s Sunday; I\u2019m tending\nto some life admin, such as\npaying rent, doing laundry,\nbinge-watching Gilmore Girls,\nyou know, the usual. All of a\nsudden an amazing cover of\nI Drove All Night (originally\nby legendary C\u00e9line Dion)\ncomes up on the radio and I\njust have to know who it\u2019s by.\nSo I whip out my phone, open\nShazam and\u2026 well shazam\nthe shit out of the song until\nit\u2019s registered and BOOM:\nI Drove All Night (B Side)\n\\\\ The Maccabees \\\\ 129\nshazams.\nContent once again, I put\nthe phone back in my pocket,\nwhen it hits me. I NEVER\nACTUALLY DO ANYTHING\nWITH THIS INFORMATION.\nSo I immediately open\nShazam again and realise\nI\u2019d fallen into this pattern\nover a year ago. There were\ndozens of great songs that I\nhad successfully identified but\nnever purchased or actively\nincorporated into a playlist.\nThings like Swedish folk\n(My Silver Lining by First Aid\nthe Twin Peaks soundtrack\nwith Aphex Twin, Beyonc\u00e9,\nand smack in the middle,\nFeist.\nI\u2019ve listened to this mix\ndozens of times and half\nof them I\u2019ve rewinded and\nbroken the flow of it just to\nhear Feist\u2019s divine, smooth,\nmelting voice call to my soul,\nencouraging it to keep itself\nafloat. I once even stepped\nout of the shower just to\nrewind the mix back to Feist.\nAnd now, finally, I can just\nput it on repeat and I can\nrefer to it by more than just\nthat little bird song (But why\ndidn\u2019t you just shazam the mix\nwhen Fe \u2013 Shhhhhhh)\nSo don\u2019t be an idiot like\nme kids. If you\u2019re gonna be\nthe guy that walks up to a\nspeaker, phone first, while\nasking an entire room of\npeople to shut up so that you\ncan shazam something, at\nleast put that song in a playlist at some point.\nBy Lef Apostolakis\nA\nwaken,\nGambino is\nback! Apart\nfrom doing\nhis regular\nmixtape\nreleases it has been a while\nsince Childish Gambino\nhas released an album to\nthe public. It can be said\nthat Gambino has evolved\ninto a completely different\nartist since his 2013 debut\nof Because of the Internet,\nwhich was heavily rap based,\nwith standard R&B backbeats\nrhythm and the instrumental\nrole. The sound, although\nnew and fresh, reminds of\n70s disco due to the heavy\nfunk influence, especially Boogieman, where I can clearly\nhear sounds which remind\nme of Kool and the Gang\u2019s\nOpen Sesame. You can\nclearly tell that Gambino has\ntaken inspiration from several\nartists throughout the creation\nof this album to achieve the\ncomplexity of sounds that he\nhas. From rock and gospel\ninfluences in Me and your\nMama to heavy synth sounds\nin Redbone, which sounds\nsimilar to something you\nwould hear from Daft Punk,\nI believe Gambino takes you\non a musical journey throughout this album.\nMany of the track titles seem\nto be directed at Gambino\u2019s\nson, with many referring to\nthe boy\u2019s mother and some\ndirectly to him. The lyrics of\nthe track Baby Boy speak of\nthe relationship Gambino\nhopes to have with his son\nas he sings, \u201cDon\u2019t take my\nbaby boy\u201d, which may be a\nlistener to interpret the mood\nof the situation without the\nbias of spoken lyrics.\nFrom acting roles to screen-writing to musical creator,\nChildish Gambino excels\nthroughout, and this album\nis no different. Awaken, My\nLove! takes us through a\nwhirlwind of funk exploration,\nwhich I gladly embarked\nupon.\n\\\\ Gambino takes\nyou on a musical\njourney throughout\nthis album \\\\\nKit and yes it\u2019s exactly what\nis sounds like), electrodance\n(Forever And Ever by Boogie\nBelgique) and English art rock\n(Worst Band in the World by\n10cc). The list goes on and on\nand on. I discovered new (to\nme) artists like Bauhaus and\nJenny Hval (give her a listen,\nshe cray) and found gems\nthat had somehow escaped\nme by artists I love, like Kate\nBush\u2019s Houdini \u2013 how had I\nnever heard this masterpiece\nbefore?! I even found some\nBuena Vista Social Club\nin there (and a Nick Jonas\nSong. I ain\u2019t proud).\nBut possibly the greatest\n\u2018discovery\u2019 was a song I love\nby an artist I love, Caught A\nLong Wind by Feist. Now the\nreason why I\u2019ve used single\nquotes is because this song is\npart of the Nicolas Jaar BBC\n1 essential mix from 2012 that\nI listen to almost on a weekly\nbasis. The mix in itself is a\nmasterpiece. In two hours it\nsomehow seamlessly blends\nAngelo Badalamenti discussing how he\u2019d come up with\nfear of Gambino\u2019s. The night\nme and your Mama met is\npurely instrumental which\nseems intentional to allow the\n\\\\ Many of the\ntrack titles seem\nto be directed at\nGambino\u2019s son \\\\\nto the tracks. His 2014 EP\nrelease Kauai already hinted\nat a change in sound, which is\nheavily reinforced in his new\nalbum Awaken, My Love!.\nThis album relies less on\nthe lyrics and more on the\n\\\\ Glassnote Records\nAwaken , My\nLove!\nA year of\nShazams and\nthis is what I\nfound\nBy Valentina Funaro\n\\\\ Sean Lucas\n\n"

A woman attempts to drown her boredom in alcoholism and observing\nher fellow commuters while on the train, but soon, her life becomes ominously\nintertwined with that of a couple over which she has been obsessing. Like most\nthrillers, this one is best enjoyed spoiler-free, that is, if you have managed it until\nnow!\n\\\\Fade to Black Productions, Focus Features, Universal Pictures\n\\\\Universal Pictures\n\\\\Poison Chef\n\\\\The Orchard\n03:30 The Girl with All the Gifts\nAnother awards darling stars Gemma Arterton as a post-apocalyptic teacher\ndesperate to protect the titular Girl with All the Gifts (Sennia Nanua) while also\ntrying to\u2026 not get eaten by her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e. Director Colm McCarthy\u2019s credits include\nepisodes of Doctor Who and Sherlock, and the subversive humour and whip-smart\nstyle shine through, although this is far darker in tone. This isn\u2019t just another dumb\nzombie movie, it\u2019s original, provocative, and really gets under your skin.\n05:40 Hunt for the Wilderpeople\nIf you enjoyed the wacky Kiwi vampire roommate comedy What We Do in the\nShadows (and if you haven\u2019t seen it, you really should), its director Taika Waititi\nhas more for you in this sincere and funny coming-of-age story. \u201cBad egg\u201d\nteenager Ricky is sent off to yet another foster home, but strikes up an unlikely\nfriendship with his grizzled foster father Hec when they embark upon an involuntary trip deep into the New Zealand forest.\n23:00 Nocturnal Animals\nWait, haven\u2019t we seen this lady already? It\u2019s Amy Adams again! In this Tom\nFord-directed feature (Yes, the designer Tom Ford), she plays an impossibly stylish\nart dealer who is confronted with her past when her ex-husband gives her a novel\nhe has written. You\u2019re quickly sucked into the disturbing parallel story of the novel\nwhich contrasts sharply with the clinically immaculate present time setting, and it\u2019s\nguaranteed to stay with you for days.\n\n"

The team performance\nis improving with every game\nand much to Zayd\u2019s delight,\nthe team is showing a lot of\nhustle, a major element in the\nsport of baseball. 2016 may\nhave had its struggles for\nImperial baseball but at the\nrate things are going 2017\nwill be our year.\nA\nfter two\nrounds of\nuniversity\nbaseball in\nthe inaugural\nNational\nLeague, the Imperial\nImmigrants are top of the\nSouth with three wins and\none loss. Splitting the doubleheader against Essex in the\nfirst round, the Immigrants\nwanted to establish control\nof the league against\nnewcomers Swansea.\nHowever, technical difficulties\ninvolving Harlington meant\nthat the games had to be\nplayed elsewhere. Croydon.\nNine Imperial players\nmanaged to show up to\nsouth London compared to\nSwansea who brought more\nthan double that number.\nThe first game of the double\nheader had some fearful\nmoments, with Swansea\ngetting a base-clearing triple\nin the top of the first; three\non the scoreboard. But in the\nbottom of the first, the Immigrants would not be outdone,\nscoring six to put them ahead.\nThe second inning showed\nthe true spirit of IC. After\nletting two players on base\nfrom an error and a walk,\nthird baseman Zayd caught\ntwo out to take the pressure\noff and let IC get the easy out\nto end the inning. Stepping\nup to the plate was Swansea\u2019s\nstar player who hit a ball\nhard into center field and with\nthe base runners going hard,\nrookie centre-fielder Joe\nturned on the hustle to make\nan incredible inning-ending\ncatch, saving two runs in the\nprocess and giving pitcher\nJustin a no-hitter inning. The\nImmigrants picked it back up\nin the third to score another\nfive runs, assisted by rookie\nStevie\u2019s impressive RBI hits\nand solid base-running by\nnewcomer Abdul and veteran\nMatt. The game ended 8-11\nto Imperial.\nThe follow-up showed\nthe improvements the team\nhas gone through since the\nstart of the year. In the first\ninning, the Immigrants got\nfive runs on the board, a lead\ncut down by the end of the\ninning. Not to be left in the\ndust, the Immigrants turned\non the jets to score another\nfour to take a 9-5 lead. Team\ncaptain Eduardo came on\nwith a Zach Britton-esque\nSolidwinsroundofftheseasonforICnetball\nI\nn a recent fixture, the 5s\nnetball team smashed\nthe Roehampton 6th\nteam\nbeating them 50-7. It\nwas an interesting away\ngame as the umpires\nseemed particularly clueless\nand uninterested in the game.\nUnfortunately, the captain\nSheethal Jethwa couldn\u2019t\nplay in the match but made\na great cheerleader by\nthe side, keeping the team\nvocal and motivated. The\nhighlight of the match was\nwatching Puja Dodhia pick\nup the ball (which everyone\nknew had gone out but the\numpires seemed blissfully\nunaware), as it slowly rolled\nacross the court, to shoot\nand score while everyone\nelse stood around not really\nunderstanding what was\ngoing on. The game ended\nwith the highest score and\nbiggest goal difference of\nthe season for the team, a\nnotable achievement. The\nplayer of the match was\nawarded to Shen Yin Ga. The\ndecisive victory for the team\nis an indication of how strong\nthis year\u2019s group of freshers\nare, with the support of\nreturning players, as well as\nthe progress being made in\ntraining. The netball 5s have\nracked up another impressive\nwin against the LSE and\nRoehampton\u2019s 5s as well.\nThe Imperial netball 1s also\ntriumphed with an impressive\nperformance against the\nImperial Medic 2s at a\npacked match in Ethos. Used\nas a varsity showcase match,\nboth teams came determined\nto win in front of a loud\ncrowd. The match was intense\nfrom the offset with both\nsets of shooters ensuring the\nmatch stayed close. Despite\nthe Medics initially taking the\nlead, the first quarter ended\nwith the Imperial 1s leading\nby seven goals, but with it all\nstill to play for. The Medics\nshowed a lot of fight in their\nplay, contesting every ball in\nthe second and third quarters.\nHowever, Imperial 1s stayed\ncalm and, using mid-court\nand defensive players Fi\nand Beth, as second options,\nallowed the team to convert\nthe vast majority of turnovers\nand centres into goals. Feeding into the shooting circle\nalso improved, with Emily and\nAmelia\u2019s passing into Charlotte being fast and accurate.\nSome very much needed fresh\nlegs in both the defensive and\ncentre court enabled Imperial\nto keep the pressure on and\nwiden the goal difference\nfurther. Special mention has\nto go to both Jasmine, the\ncoach, and the Haribo Filippa\nbrought for keeping the team\nmotivated and focused into\nthe last quarter. The end of\nthe match saw impressive\nplay, especially from the GD\nand GK who kept up the pressure despite tiredness. The\nfinal score was 59-31 to the\nImperial 1s, with player of the\nmatch going to Emily Calamita. The netball club would\nlike to thank everyone who\nturned up to support them.\nImperial College has six\nnetball teams who play on\nMondays and Wednesday\nday at Heston and Ethos.\nNeedless to say, recent form\nmakes a compelling case\nfor a varsity headlined by\nNetball. People are welcome\nto come and support our\nplayers at any match.

The drivers don\u2019t get paid enough for\nthat. Finally, you get to their place. Sadly, you tidied up for nothing. They\u2019ll offer you a drink.\nAccept, stay hydrated. If you\u2019re drunk, maybe call an Uber and tell them to take you home. If\nthey\u2019re drunk, definitely do that.\nBut you\u2019re not drunk, you\u2019re a responsible adult and you\u2019re going to get laid tonight. Now\nyou\u2019re in their room, all over each other. You\u2019re about to get laid, but aren\u2019t you forgetting some-thing? #foreplay\nTake it slow, oral comes as standard. Feel free to explore your partner\u2019s body. Make sure\nthey\u2019re cool with everything as you go. Find that spot that makes them moan. If they moan someone else\u2019s name, well, that\u2019s your name from now on. If you have a penis, it should not be the first\nthing to go anywhere. If you have a vagina, you are the conductor. You control the trains!\nThe sex\n1. Use a condom/alternative barrier\nprotection\n2. Bumping uglies\n\u2022 In\n\u2022 Out\n\u2022 Repeat until satisfied\n3. Don\u2019t ignore the clit. Acknowledge the prostate.\nLeave\nYou have a ten minute window after sex in which to get up, get\ndressed, and get the fuck out of there, no questions asked. If that\nwindow passes, you have to stay there and pretend that you\u2019re\nenjoying cuddling until they fall asleep. We don\u2019t make up these\nrules, society does, and you\u2019d better obey them.\nOnce they\u2019re asleep, and you\u2019ve liberated all your limbs, raise your\nhead and scout around the room for your belongings like a meerkat.\nAnything you can\u2019t immediately see is gone forever. See, we told\nyou not to bring anything valuable. Pick your shit up and exit the\nbedroom \u2013 you can get dressed in the hallway. Now get out before\nanyone notices. If you\u2019re so inclined, take a memento (nothing valua-ble, you\u2019re not a fucking thief. Take a protein bar or a juice box!).\nSo you fucked up. You haven\u2019t left.\nIt\u2019s the morning. Hey, maybe this was on purpose. Maybe they live in Dulwich, and\nyou\u2019ve got to wait for the first tube. Regardless, there are two scenarios.\nScenario 1: You woke up first.\nYou\u2019ve lost the advantage of the darkness of\nthe night, but you can still salvage this \u2013 try\nand actually follow step 6 and leave now.\nCongrats.\nScenario 2: They woke up first.\nThey haven\u2019t noticed that you\u2019re awake yet, so you have some time\nto think. You really have to pee, but you need to consider whether\nyou want to get morning sex out of this. If you do, you have to do\nit before you get out of bed. It\u2019s not morning sex if you\u2019ve got out\nof bed, it\u2019s just sex that happens to be in the morning. Morning sex\ncounts as part of the one night stand, but if it\u2019s sex in the morning,\nyou\u2019re technically seeing this person steadily. You are now in a\nrelationship. Congrats.\n4\nThe journey\nhome\n6\n7 Ugh, mornings.\n5\nWhy haven\u2019t you\nleft yet?\nconductor\n#prostate\nAknowledge\nme\nHow to have a one night stand (in Metric)\nI know this says that this is about Metric, but really it could apply to any place, at any time, with\nany person.\nJUST THE TIP\nPreparation\nIf you\u2019re planning on pulling, you need to prepare yourself and your\nenvironment. This means making sure that your personal grooming\nis on point and your fridge is stocked. Sex is 90% preparation, 10%\ncopulation.\nBe warned: Don\u2019t take anything you\u2019re particularly attached to BUT\nDO TAKE CONDOMS (and maybe lube. And maybe a portable\ndouche. No, don\u2019t take a douche. You\u2019re prepared, you\u2019ve already\ndouched. Unless you\u2019ve been eating Mexican food. In that case pack\nyour portable douche and some faith.)\nFirst contact\nIdentify your target (not in a predatory way). They\u2019re usually found\nwaiting at the bar. Don\u2019t go for the hottest person (they\u2019re out of your\nleague). Go for their second most attractive friend.\nInitiate eye contact (if you\u2019re a gay man, eye contact for over three\nseconds mean you have given them a licence to touch you.) If they\ndon\u2019t reciprocate, move on. Quantity over quality, it\u2019s a numbers\ngame. If it gets too late in the evening, lower your standards and keep\ntrying.\nOnce someone has returned your daring glances, stop. Immediately\nstop. No seriously, stop. The fish has been hooked. Do not go up to\nthem and deliver a one liner. Do not buy them sambuca. Tequila on\nthe other hand\u2026\nGo to the bar, stand next to them (order a drink, don\u2019t be creepy),\nand try and talk to them. Now we can\u2019t tell you what to say or how to\nsay it (other than with confidence). If we could we\u2019d be millionaires.\nGive it a go. You still have plausible deniability. You\u2019re just getting a\ndrink. Talk to them for a bit, get a drink and return to your group. Pat\nyourself on the back.\nSealing the deal\nYou\u2019ve made a few contacts, you\u2019ve found someone that you really click with. You like them, and they keep\nfinding excuses to touch you (not inappropriately, you perv. If they\u2019re touching you inappropriately, call Security.). It\u2019s almost time for the kiss, but first, make a really bad joke and see if they laugh.\nThey\u2019re laughing. Good. Once the laughter has subsided, just keep your chill (you\u2019re getting closer). Maintain\nstrong eye contact, with the occasional glance to the lips. If the feeling is mutual, gravity will do the rest.\nIf the night is young, don\u2019t be too keen, let them know you\u2019ll see them later and go and hang out with\nyour friends. Get their number first though. When you\u2019re ready to go, find them, or if that fails, send them a\nmessage.\nWhen you\u2019ve finally located them, make sure that making out with them is still A-okay. It is? Good. Ask, \u201cDo\nyou... wanna go someplace else?\u201d There\u2019s literally no other acceptable way to phrase this. If you\u2019ve done\neverything correctly, they will.\nGood things to have\n\u2022 A clean bathroom\n\u2022 Spare towels (clean spare towels if\nyou\u2019re feeling fancy)\n\u2022 A tidy room\n\u2022 Oral hygiene\n\u2022 An underwear strategy (are you going\nfor comfort? Sexiness? Are you gonna\ngo commando?)\n2\nMake sure you\u2019re\nprepared!\nBlonde or\nbrunette?\n3\n1\n\n"

What a\nwinter of discontent, I said,\nfor the meninists, won\u2019t\nsomeone please think of all\nthose poor men fighting for\na world where old white\ndudes can hold more power\neconomically, socially, and\npolitically? It seems the\nuniverse is not a fan of gentle\nsarcasm; the meninists have\nhad the last laugh.\nThey might\u2019ve taken America, but by Jove, they won\u2019t\nhave Pirelli. Last year, the tyre\ncompany's annual calendar,\nwhich has become a fashion\nphotography touchstone,\ntheretofore known as a\nbastion of soft-porn, shifted its\nfocus from the perfect body\nto perfect accomplishments.\nThe 2016 edition featured\nSerena Williams (a great\nmix of perfect accomplishment and perfect body), Ava\nDuVernay, Patti Smith, Fran\nLeibovitz amongst others.\n\"How would they top this?\" I\nwondered, then \u2013 surely the\nonly way would be to feature\nRuth Bader Ginsburg as Miss\nJuly? Peter Lindbergh, this\nyear\u2019s photographer, may not\nhave taken all my advice to\nheart, but has stuck with the\ngeneral theme of not objecti-fying women set last year. He\nfeatures a roster of actresses\nincluding Julianne Moore,\nHelen Mirren, Robin Wright.\nAll are fully clothed, shot\nin tasteful black and white;\naccording to Lindbergh not\na single wrinkle or blemish\nhas been magicked away\nwith a blender brush-happy\ntouch-up artist.\nLindbergh claims that he\nhas replaced nudity with emotional nakedness, saying, \u201cit\u2019s\nanother kind of naked, more\nimportant than body parts.\nWhat is more than being\nnaked is to show yourself the\n71-year-old Helen Mirren\n\u2013 where\u2019s my prize?\" The\nfashion industry shouldn\u2019t be\ngetting pats on the back for\nbeing shining beacons of progressivism for such lukewarm\nactions. Pirelli has done well\nThePirelli#nofilter2017calendar\nIndira Mallik\nway you are.\u201d The sentiment\nis laudable, and certainly\nthe fashion world could do\nwith less Photoshop, but the\nsoftly lit images of extremely\nbeautiful actresses (and\nAnastasia Ignatova, a lecturer\nat the Moscow State Institute\nof International Relations)\naren\u2019t nearly as revolutionary as Pirelli imagines them\nto be; Lindbergh may think\nhis photographs are \u201ca cry\nfor beauty today against\nthe terror of perfection and\nyouth\u201d, and to be fair to\nhim, a wide diversity of age\nranges are represented, but\nthere are not what many\nconsider 'imperfections' to be\nfound here. All the women\nfeatured are classically beau-tiful, slim, cis, able-bodied,\nand the overwhelming majority are white. Zhang Zhi, and\nLupita N\u2019yongo, who to the\ncynical seems sometimes to\nbe the only black woman the\nfashion world will acknowledge (okay, Naomi Campbell\ntoo) are the only ones to\nrepresent women of colour.\nLindbergh\u2019s pictures are\nblandly pretty, they are also\nsmugly self-satisfied. The\ncalendar seems to say \"I\ndared to print a picture of\n\\\\ Classically\nbeautiful, slim, cis,\nable-bodied, and\noverwhelming\nwhite \\\\\nUma Thurman \\\\ Peter Lindbergh/Pirelli Calendar\nto not revert back to their\nhyper-sexualised, objectifying\nimages of yesteryear, but if\nwe were waiting for Pirelli\u2019s\nfeminist revolution, this isn\u2019t it.\nJulianne Moore \\\\ Peter Lindbergh/Pirelli Calendar\n\n"

With time to spare for\nthe journey down we enjoyed\na leisurely first leg, including\na pleasant stop at one of the\nM4\u2019s finest service stations.\nUnfortunately, the stop\nquickly descended into ICSM\nrugby-style carnage, as Joe\nwrenched the sliding doors\noff their rollers. With yet more\nbrute force the problem was\nsolved and we continued on\nour way.\nSome time later and the\nfirst day of sailing got under\nway. This consisted of a\n\u2018round robin\u2019 with the two\nWreckeverybodyandbeproudofit\nF\nrom Friday the\n25th\nNovember to\nSunday the 27th\n, the\nstreets of Sheffield\nwere invaded by\nninjas. More than\n650 jitsukas (the name given\nto those that practice JiuJitsu)\nfrom all over the UK gathered\nduring the weekend for the\nAtemi National Competition.\nFirst of all, what is JiuJitsu?\nIt\u2019s a super-awesome Japanese martial art which is all\nabout taking your opponent\u2019s\nbalance and controlling it.\nYou start as a novice (white\nbelt), then level up through\nthe colours of the rainbow to\nbrown. If you\u2019ve made it that\nfar you can become a scary\nblack belt! You learn numerous ways to throw somebody\non the floor and completely\ndominate them with locks on\narms, legs, ankles, wrists \u2013\nanything really.\nThe weekend was split\nbetween training on Saturday\nand Sunday morning (for\nthose who can jitsu their way\nthrough a hangover) and\ncompetition in the afternoon,\nwith a video game themed\nparty on Saturday evening\nand a massive 650 person\nMannequin challenge to top\nit all off. All the participants\nwere divided into their respective belt colours, and each\nparticipant had to demonstrate their technique in a\n\u2018Gauntlet\u2019 and a \u2018V\u2019:\nThe Gauntlet: walk between\ntwo lines of people, who\nare going to attack you\n(with punches, blunt knives,\nwooden sticks and swords)\none after the other. Fun. This\nis where you show off how\nbeautifully and safely you can\napply a technique.\nThe V: two lines of people\nstanding in a V, an instructor\nat its end is going to send\npeople to attack you at the\npace they seem appropriate:\nfast and furious (no relation).\nThis is where you demonstrate\nhow you deal with pressure,\nand how fast you can subdue\nan opponent, it\u2019s kind of scary\nbut you get used to it.\nSaturday morning, survivors (everybody except the\nPresident and VP of the club)\nImperial teams sailing against\nrandomly selected teams\nfrom other universities, before\nbeing placed into bronze,\nsilver and gold leagues for\nthe next stage of the com-petition. The well-practiced\nImperial Blue team had a\ngreat morning, getting multiple wins under their belts,\nwith the afternoon following\na similar pattern. For the less\nexperienced Imperial Whites,\nhighlights included our solitary win of the day against\nBristol White, and lunch,\nduring which Calvin and I\nshared a deliciously filled\npie. The first day also saw a\ngrudge match between the\nImperial Blues and Whites,\nwith the Blues coming out on\ntop by only one place.\nHeading back to our overnight accommodation both\nteams bore witness to some\nof Bristol\u2019s grimiest student\nhouses, before leaving again\nfor a night of Indian food and\ncheap booze. The next day\nsaw the Blues put in some\nvery strong performances.\nDue to the stiff competition\nthey faced in the gold league,\nthe Blues ended the day\nunable to add to their tally\nof wins \u2013 though they more\nthan deserved to. For the\nWhites, it seemed our luck\nhad changed. Placed in the\nbronze league, we finally\ngot to sail against teams\nof a similar standard (half\nour team had never sailed\nin a competition before).\nWe narrowly missed out on\nbeating our training partners,\nthe University of London\n1s, and after switching up\ncrews, secured two wins \u2013 we\ndestroyed UWE by crossing\nthe line in first, second and\nthird. A narrow victory over\nSolent Red by one place\nmeant we placed 3rd\nin our\ngroup.\nA fantastic weekend\nwas had by all, with some\ntop-quality sailing. If we\u2019ve\ninspired you to give sailing\na go, get in contact with us\non Facebook or email us at\nsailing@imperial.ac.uk. We\u2019ve\ngot something for everyone,\nregardless of ability!\nFraser Goldsworth\ntrained and competitors who\nmade it through the two\nrounds on Friday got to go\nthrough the final round in the\nafternoon, where one of our\ngreen belts beasted her way\nthrough to Gold. The highlight\nof the weekend was watching\na junior grading. Nothing like\nseeing five year olds throwing\npeople twice their size.\nCloe Fradin\n\\\\ Five year olds\nthrowing people\ntwice their size \\\\\nICFootball2sloseremainingpride\nT\nhe IC Football 3s\nfinally settled who\nthe best of the\nbunch is in ICUAFC\nwith a deserving\n3-2 win in a club\nfriendly over the 2s.\nEven though this game was\nof little importance to anyone\noutside of the club, the pressure was on for both teams as\npride was at stake for the 2s\ncaptain, Fraser Read, should\nhis side have failed to get the\nwin. The current league positions are shown below.\nThe opening exchanges\nwere dominated by the 2s,\ntrying to establish an early\nhold on the game. Although\nthe 3s knew they had quality\non their side (well maybe not\nLoic Alix-Brown), they perhaps did not have the belief\nMedicsbeatenbymultiplescreamers\nI\nC games versus the\nMedics are always\nfierce contests and this\nwas no different. The\ngame started off pretty\ncagey with little quality,\na bit of a West Bromwich\nAlbion and Hull City game,\nboth sides didn\u2019t want to give\nanything away. The game\nneeded a bit of spark and\nthat was provided when Jack\nNicholls slid a ball through\nto Ryan Jude who sent the\ndefender for a bag of hot\nchips and a sausage roll and\nthen buried the finish. The 6s\nthen turned from West Brom\ninto Barcelona and turned\non the charm. We won the\nball back from kick off and\nRyan had his man on toast\nagain, got to the by-line and\nforced an own goal. Charlie\nPowell then pinged a corner\nin and Jack punted one from\nthe edge of the box low and\nhard and beat the keeper,\n3-0 and in complete control.\nThen in the aftermath of a set\npiece, Neil Leisner wrapped\nhis Mr Tickle leg round a\nloose ball and hit a half volley\ninto the top corner that was\narguably better than Marco\nvan Basten\u2019s volley against\nRussia in 1988 \u2013 absolute\nbelter. Medics then pulled\none back but the goal\ndifference was restored soon\nafter. A ball was headed out\nfrom a corner and the last\nman back, left-back Elliott\nBoyes unleashed an absolute\nnetbuster from 30 yards that\nripped into the top right bin.\nDifferent gravy. We walked\ninto half time feeling like\nmillionaires and the game felt\nkilled off at 5-1. To be fair to\nthem, the Medics did turn up\nin the second half to pull two\nback; it was a bit of a backs\nagainst the wall performance\nbut Paolo held it together and\nwe saw out the game at 5-3.\nThe introduction of Omar\nInuwa with 20 minutes to\nplay added a bit of pace and\nstrength to the attack but his\nto transfer this skill to the\ngame. There were few clear\ncut chances and most of the\nearly efforts on the 3s goal\nwere speculative from range.\nAs the half continued, the\n3s grew into the game and\nkept more possession of the\nball, looking stronger going\nforward.\nAs is the way with many\na big game (looking at you\nUnited) the first half had\npromised much, but delivered\nlittle, ending 0-0.\nWith the half time break\nand Andrew Miller\u2019s usual\ninspirational speech over, the\nsecond half began.\nDisaster struck almost\ninstantly for the 3s, with right\nback and all round good guy\nDouglas Paterson falling fowl\nto a dodgy hamstring and\nbeing forced to come off.\nWho knew that this would\nspark an outpour of goals in\nthe game: the 2s struck first\nwith a smart finish to take the\nlead. The 3s showed strong\nresilience and bounced back\nwith 2 goals in quick succes-sion, the second of which\nwas heavily disputed by the\nopposition due to what they\nfelt was a foul on the keeper.\nIt would appear that some\ncosmic force was in play,\nbecause shortly after, the\n2s levelled the game with a\nsimilarly dubious goal where\nthe keeper appeared to be\nfouled.\nWith the game poised at\n2-2 there was no room for\nerror. A couple of chances\ncame and went for both sides\nand the game was as open\nas it had been since the start.\nWith just minutes remaining,\nthe ball fell to Loic\u2019s feet, who\nmasterfully beat his man and\nsent a beautiful delivery into\nthe middle. Waiting to knock\nit home was star striker Stanley Ho to make it 3-2.\nEuphoria for the 3s.\n\\\\ Who knew that\nthis would spark an\noutpour of goals in\nthe game \\\\\nDoug Paterson\nlack of game time in recent\nweeks showed. From his first\ntouch you would think he had\nlego bricks for feet.

Yes, Imperial is\na fun place.\nIf you weren\u2019t aware of\nthem you\u2019re probably not\nalone, as the mascots are\nrarely wheeled out due to\nfear of inter-constituent\nunion theft.\nThe presentation stirred\na lively discussion, with\nmany Council Members\nprotesting the ban on\nthe year-long tradition of\nmascot stealing.\nConstituent Union members found responsible\nfor allowing their mascot\nto be stolen would in\nthe past be penalised by\ndowning a yard or writing\nan apology article in felix\n(which we would like to\npoint out is not a right but\na privilege). But Olson\nargued that \u201cthese traditions that do not represent\nthe current image and\nstudent body of the Constituent Unions of Imperial\nCollege.\u201d\nAt one point he suggested that in the future,\nan appropriate measure\nfor stealing a mascot\nwould be calling the\npolice, but his proposal\nwas met with outrage by\nseveral of the attendees.\nIn the end, although\nCouncil agreed on the\nvalue of Mascotry to Imperial\u2019s culture and the need\nfor appropriate conduct\nduring any events where\nmascots are revealed to\nthe eager public (because\nwho doesn\u2019t love a\nseven-foot long rectal\nthermometer?), declaring\nall mascots inviolate was\nnot passed and Olson\napologised for wasting the\nCouncil\u2019s time.\n\\\\ Who doesn\u2019t\nlove a seven-foot long rectal\nthermometer? \\\\\nMeet Theta.

However they\ndid join us in a spectacular\nVelociraptor moment.\nWhile the rugby game was\nlost, the costume game was\nwon, as rugby prepared for\na Jurassic Park themed night\nat Jesters. With an increase\nin Southampton buddies to\nparty with, it was a magical\nnight of green and red\ndrinks, fire code violations\nand double-toilet cubicles.\nReturning home once again\nto the joy that is pizza, it was\na wonderful end to the 20\nhour long day. Exhausted but\nproud of all we\u2019d accom-plished, rugby indulged in\nthe customary IKEA Sunday\nbreakfast, with a few players\nventuring into the children\u2019s\nsections to buy a stuffed tiger\nperformances across the pitch\nand looked to be going to\nextra time until a Kingston\nstriker scored a soul crushing\ngoal, finishing 1-0.\nThe first team went back\nto their winning ways in the\nnext two games with a 2-0\nvictory against UCL 3s (two\nfrom golden girl Lorraine)\nand a 17-1 thrashing of King\u2019s\nCollege. The highlight of this\nmatch saw Anna breaking\nthrough from centre half to\nscore two very good individual goals.\nThe second team have\nhad a very similar start. The\nfirst match was a solid 6-1\nvictory over SOAS. Goals\nfrom Jess, Sorenza, Camille\nand Megan. Their second\ngame was a thrilling away\nfixture against the veterinary\ncollege. A couple of last\nminute drop-outs meant that\nImperial were down to ten\nplayers and it was going to\nbe a tough game. But by\ntaking the few chances they\nwere given IC went into the\nbreak 3-0 up. Pressure from\nthe eleven players of royal\nveterinary college eventually\npaid off and they drew level\npart way through the second\nhalf. Goals were exchanged\nbetween the two sides until it\nwas 5-4 to Imperial with ten\nminutes remaining. Imperial\nalmost had it wrapped up but\ngave away a penalty in the\nlast few seconds of the game.\nFortunately the veterinary\nplayer hit it over the bar and\nImperial were well deserved\nwinners after a tremendous\neffort from all. The match ball\nwhen to hat-trick hero Jess,\nwith the remaining goals supplied by Rachel and Camille.\nThe 2s team did slightly\nbetter in the cup than the 1s,\nwinning their first round game\n18-0 but unfortunately going\nout in the second round with\na loss to UCL 1s (we only had\nten players!).\nMegan Kenny\nand turtle puppet as souvenirs\nof the weekends awesome-ness. Bring on next year\nSouthampton!\nRebecca Simpson\n\n"

Never mind\nthe misspelling of Marten's\nname from the self appointed\nspelling and grammar\n'saviour' \u2013 Marten's work\nis far from 'modish crap'\n(whatever that means) and in\nfact, her work may be closer\nto J.M.W. Turner's than it first\nappears.\nTurner's brushwork was\nloose, evocative rather than\nrepresentative, similarly,\nMarten\u2019s sculptures are freeform \u2013 transforming everyday\nobjects into object salads that\nlook like daydreams forced\ninto three dimensions. Speaking to Charlotte Higgins of the\nGuardian, Marten has said\nshe reads and researches\nwithout \u201cany specific end\ngoal in mind\u201d, her reading\nmatter is diverse, from philosophy to poetry by way of the\nnews. It\u2019s stream-of-conscious-ness poetry that most comes\nto mind when encountering\nMarten\u2019s work; steel is tacked\nonto timber, cloth is draped\nlike discarded clothing,\nspoons are bent out of shape\nand hammered onto a corner,\nelsewhere matchsticks are\nthreaded through the work.\nIt\u2019s as if Marten has emptied\nout her half-formed thoughts\ninto the physical world. We\nare left to follow the trail of\nassociations, the flights of\nfancy, the abrupt changes of\nmood \u2013 sometimes they lead\nnowhere, sometimes they\nstrike a chord with our own\nthoughts.\nThe Turner Prize judges\nnominees not for the work\nthey create for the Prize exhi-bition, but work displayed the\npreceding year. For Marten,\none of these was her show at\nGreene Naftali: Eucalyptus,\nLet Us In. The mediums list\nfor one piece in the show,\nBrood and Bitter Pass, should\ngive some indication of the\nbreadth of materials Marten\ndraws inspiration from: steel,\naluminium, model board, ash,\ncherry, chipboard, sprayed\nMDF, blown glass, glazed\nceramic, screen printed\nLatex, bucket, cast resin,\ncast jesmonite, stones; so\nthe list continues, including\neverything from magnets,\nconcrete, cotton, and lace, to\n2016 has been a year of\nunmitigated success \u2013 last\nmonth she won the Hepworth\nPrize for Sculpture, another\nhugely prestigious award.\nand now it is the Turner, she\nis also holding a solo show at\nthe Serpentine Gallery. The\nartists nominated alongside\nher were Anthea Hamilton,\nJosephine Pryce, and Michael\nDean. For some, Michael\nDean was the dark horse\nin the race, who could\u2019ve\nbagged the top prize. Dean\u2019s\nexhibition was an installation\nrepresenting the poverty\nline \u2013 a pile of over 2 million\npennies, just one penny less\nthan the \u00a320,436 that the\ngovernment believes is the\nminimum two adults and two\nchildren could survive on in a\nyear.\nLast year, the Turner Prize,\nwhich celebrates the best\nartists under 50 of that year,\nwent to the architectural\ngroup, Assemble, who won\nfor their transformation of the\nhousing estate Granby Four\nStreets. It was a departure\nfrom the norm to award\nthe prize to a project that\nwas ostensibly not 'art'. No\nHelenMartenwinstheTurnerPrize\nIndira Mallik\n\\\\ Marten uses\neverything from\nrubber and concrete\nto sand and oyster\nshell in her freeform\nsculptures \\\\\ntwigs, oyster shell, and sugar.\nThe list of materials alone\ncould be a sort of free-form\nminimalist poetry.\nWhat is perhaps the most\nnoteworthy of Marten\u2019s\nwork is that despite her use\nof everyday objects, almost\nnothing is a ready-made \u2013\nthis is not simply hordes of\nfound things tacked together.\nInstead, objects appear as\nif from a half-remembered\ndream \u2013 that there could\nalmost be fire hydrant, almost\nbut not quite, in another\nsculpture, the end could be\nscraps from a rocket, or a\ngiant bullet blown apart\nand stuck back together. In\nanother work, Packed for\nPerdition, in the right corner,\na curve hangs like a sickle\nmoon against a night sky.\nUnderneath, a tiny keyboard\nis drawn on a grid, and\nbeside it it\u2019s raining on a\ncardboard cut-out of a house,\nonly the rain seems to be\nacid rain, and falls like the\npatterns of Braille. Despite\nthe seemingly absurd nature\nof her work, Marten carefully\nconsiders the placement of\neach detail, finding acute\nclarity in her work. Certainly,\nthe shapes she creates look\nconsidered, they flow \u2013 one\nobject melting seamlessly into\nanother, look closer and there\nare eye-catching details \u2013 a\nsudden drop of rope, a spike\njutting out at precisely the\nright angle. These are works\nthat, once seen, are not easily\nforgotten.\nFor 31-year-old Marten,\nstranger to controversy, the\nPrize will no doubt raise eye-brows, (at least the eyebrows\nof the public \u2013 the critics by\nand large were fans) again\nthis year for their celebration\nof Marten.\nThat Marten\u2019s work defies\nexplanation was a strength\nfor this year\u2019s judges. The\nchair of judges, Tate Britain\ndirector Alex Farquharson,\npraised Marten for her poetic\nsculpting technique, saying:\n\u201cThe judges were impressed\nby the complexity of the\nwork...how it often suggests\nmeaning, but those meanings\nare all in flux somehow. One\nimage, one form becomes\nanother.\u201d Marten\u2019s work\nis unlike that of any of her\ncontemporaries, that it sparks\nconversation about art, and\nthe forms it can take can only\nbe a good thing.\nMarten has said she finds\nthe whole idea of winning\nprizes \u201cembarrassing\u201d, she\nhas gone so far as to say that\nshe will share her winnings of\n\u00a325,000 amongst her fellow\nnominees. There is a true\nspirit of originality in Marten\nwork, the Turner has elevated\nmany of its winners, Chris\nOfili, Tracey Emin, Damien\nHirst to name a few to lasting\ninfluence in the modern art\nworld \u2013 Marten will hope that\nthis new accolade will encourage more people to engage\nand attempt to understand\nher vision.\n\\\\ Stream-ofconsciousness\npoetry comes to\nmind when\nencountering\nMarten\u2019s work \\\\\nBrood and Bitter Pass (detail) \\\\ Helen Marten\nT\nhe story of Peter\nPan, popularised\nby Disney in 1953,\nhardly needs\nany introduction.\nHowever, not\neveryone knows of its\ndarker history. J.M. Barrie\nfirst invented the character\nin 1902 in The Little White\nBird, a semi-autobiographical\nstory about a small boy who\nis befriended by a lonely\nLondon bachelor. In actual\nfact, Peter Pan was based on\nthe five boys of the Llewelyn\nDavies family who Barrie\ncame to know. There have\nbeen some questions raised\nabout the exact nature of\nBarrie\u2019s interest in these boys;\nat any rate, he went on to\nbecome their guardian after\nthe successive deaths of\ntheir parents. The final Peter\nPan was a \u201cdemon boy\u201d, a\ndevilish character who Barrie\noriginally specified as the\nvillain of the story.\nLike the boy himself, Peter\nPan has been adapted into\na multitude of shapes and\nforms. But from the moment\nNana steps onto stage \u2013 a\nburly man dressed in a frilly\nnursemaid\u2019s outfit \u2013 one gets\nthe idea that Sally Cookson\u2019s\nproduction will be a touch\nunconventional. Casting the\nmiddle-aged Paul Hilton as\nPeter is a masterful stroke\nthat brings out the paradox\nof Peter\u2019s stubborn refusal to\ngrow up. The disconnect between Peter\u2019s\nphysical and mental\nmaturity is jarring;\ndespite his receding hairline, he\nhas no idea\nwhat a kiss is,\nand curls up in\nhis old perambulator with a\nteddy bear.\nThere is an\nunderlying\ntheme of maternal affection\nthat few productions of Peter Pan\nmanage to pick up.\nBarrie\u2019s troubled childhood was overshadowed\nby his mother\u2019s love for his\nelder brother David. When\nDavid died at a tragically\nyoung age in a skating\naccident, Barrie strived to\nreplace him, dressing up in his\ndead brother\u2019s clothes so that\n\u201ceven [his] mother should not\nknow the difference\u201d. Perhaps\nit is not such a surprise that\nBarrie\u2019s Peter Pan returned\nhome only to find the window\nbarred and another little boy\nsleeping in his bed. The first\ntitle for Peter Pan was Peter\nPan, or The Boy Who Hated\nMothers. Startlingly, Captain\nHook and Mrs. Darling were\noriginally meant to be played\nby the same actress, throwing\nPeter and the mother figure\ninto direct conflict.\nSally Cookson, the director,\nreturns to this original casting:\nAnna Francolini tucks her\nchildren lovingly into bed as\nMrs. Darling, but makes a\nfrightful Captain Hook who\n\\\\ Cookson\u2019s\nproduction retains\na frolicsome energy\ndespite the\nmelancholy at its\nheart \\\\\nHooked on\nPeter Pan\nClaire Chan\nPeter Pan is on at the National\nTheatre until 4th February 2017\nTickets from \u00a315\nWendy and Peter flying \\\\ Steve Tanner\nunhesitatingly disembowels a\nsailor for wanting his teddy.\nAs with the other characters\nin the play, Captain Hook\nis more than just a one-di-mensional bad guy. For all\nher piratical swagger and\nbluster, she is really a balding,\ndesolate woman pursued\nby Tick Tock the crocodile,\na thinly veiled metaphor for\nthe closing jaws of Time. Her\nobsession with Peter Pan is a\ntwisted version of maternal\nlove. And while Peter triumphs\nover Captain Hook, he ultimately fails to take Wendy\nfrom Mrs. Darling at the end\nof the play.\nFor the many children in\nthe audience, such ideas of\ngrowing up and abandonment probably went right\nover their heads. But there\nwas no shortage of things\nto keep them entertained.\nFlashing lights, floating\nplanets, thrilling fight scenes\nand the suitably buccaneering\nCaptain Hook made for a\nriveting two hours that lived\nup to the wild imagination of\nits author. Best of all, if you\u2019re\ngoing to have characters that\ncan fly, you might as well\nmake good use of them. As\nPeter and Wendy soared out\nacross the audience on their\n\u201cfairy strings\u201d, the cheering\naudience certainly agreed.\nSally Cookson\u2019s take on\nPeter Pan is refreshing, if only\nbecause bowdlerised versions so rarely attempt to\ncapture the essence of\nJ.M. Barrie\u2019s \u201cterrible\nmasterpiece\u201d. As\nwith the original\nincarnation,\nCookson\u2019s\nproduction\nretains a frolicsome energy\ndespite the\nmelancholy\nat its heart.\nThis bittersweet\nproduction is\ndefinitely for\ngrown-ups too \u2013\neven if, like Wendy\nat the end of the\nplay, we have already\n\u201cforgotten how to fly\u201d.\nThe lost boys \\\\ Steve Tanner\n\n"

All after\nan inspiring evening of chocolate with Chantal Coady\nOBE, the creative director\nand founder of Rococo\nChocolates, a proudly British,\nLondon based chocolate\ncompany.\nIt started off with a perfectly\nunexciting Wednesday in\ncollege, struggling to keep\nmy eyes open in front of a\nhandful of lecture recordings.\nAfter an additional few hours\nof messy doodling (which was\nsupposed to be an engineering drawing of a pressure\nvessel), I wrapped up,\nmarched past the glittering\nHarrods, a few shiny cars and\nan array of luxury brands on\nSloane Street, and around the\ncorner to the quiet Motcombe\nStreet where the doors of\nRococo Chocolates stood.\nBy then it was already\nsix o\u2019clock. The skies had\ndarkened and the navy blue\ndoors blended in with the\ncold December blackness. Yet\nthe display window shone like\na warm, bright star: boxes\nof chocolates laid across the\nwindow sill in their signature\nwhite-and-blue patterned\ncoat, tied around by bright\norange ribbons. A small\nChristmas tree stood dressed\nin red and gold baubles\namongst a string of glittering\nfairy lights.\nI pushed open the door\ngently and entered the shop.\nIt felt like stepping back in\ntime \u2013 from the street of\nmodern, soaring house prices\ninto an old fashioned, country\ncottage of a chocolate shop,\nreminiscent of those I\u2019ve read\nin those wonderful stories\nby Roald Dahl. Wooden\ncupboards lined up against\nthe pastel blue coloured\nwalls, balancing bars upon\nbars of chocolate wrapped in\ncolourful paper. Glass shelves\nwere stocked full of chocolate\nbuttons, jelly babies, dainty\npieces of ganache which you\ncan purchase by the piece.\nA few wooden tables stood\nby the window, with glasses\nof champagne, plates of chocolate and platters of mellow,\nearthy chocolate tapenade\n(yes, CHOCOLATE tapenade)\nspread on crackers, ready to\nkick off the night.\nChristy Lam\nIt took 2 rounds of champagne for everyone to arrive.\nFashionably late, as bloggers\ncall it. We were introduced to\nthe team of young, friendly\nteam behind the daily\noperations of the brand, and\nof course, the mastermind:\nChantal. She stood at the end\nof the table, smiling in her\nclean apron with Rococo\u2019s\nsignature pattern (taken from\nan antique French chocolate mould catalogue), her\nblonde hair cut short, ready\nto share her story of Rococo\nChocolates.\nThe story began with a vivid\nexcerpt of her childhood\ndreams: running around valleys of chocolate (think Willy\nWonka\u2019s Chocolate Factory),\ncollecting chocolates and\nsweets in her skirt, then hiding\nthem under her pillow. She\nwould then wake up, reach\nunder her pillow and be disappointed by the absence.\nThe story quickly jumped to\nher days as a squatting Fine\nArts student in the late 70\u2019s,\nwhen she was offered a Saturday job selling Mars bars at\nHarrods (and yes, Mars bars\nwere a luxury back in the\nday). She later graduated to\nthe luxury chocolates section,\nwrapping up boxes of creamy\nLeonidas to the wealthy, and\non one occasion, Sir Michael\nCaine.\nAfter being let go from\nHarrods for coming to work\nwith emerald-coloured hair\nand spending a few months\nof boredom at an office job,\nshe set her mind to create\nher own magical paradise of\nchocolate. Armed with her\nstrong passion, business skills\nfrom Margaret Thatcher\u2019s\nYouth Training Scheme, and\na hefty bank loan (with the\nfamily house as the collat-eral), she opened the doors\nof her first shop on King\u2019s\nRoad in 1983. Her shop, complete with a sugar chandelier,\nfitted into the then rebellious\nvibe of Kings Road, fulfilling\nthe imagination of chocolate\nlovers who had come on pilgrimages to escape the stale,\n\\\\ The story began\nwith a vivid excerpt\nof her childhood\ndreams: running\naround valleys of\nchocolate, collecting\nchocolates and\nsweets in her skirt,\nthen hiding. She\nwould then wake up\nand be disappointed\nby the absence \\\\\nsuffocating, stuffy, department stores.\nThe first ten years wasn\u2019t\neasy. They had their ups and\ndowns, picked themselves up\nand continued on their jour-ney. Their first products were\nchocolates produced by small\nBelgian and French compa-nies, until when she came\nacross Valrhona (a French\nspecialist chocolate manu-facturer) which influenced\nher to start producing her\nown chocolates in 1990. She\ngot more and more involved\nin the chocolate industry,\npushing to remove hydrogenated vegetable fats, artificial\nvanilla and excess sugar, and\nalso founded the Chocolate\nSociety in 1991, determined\nto inject real chocolate into\nthe market.\nA major event in her 25\nyears in industry was the\nbond between Rococo\nand Grenada Chocolate\nCompany. Recognising how\nspecial their chocolate were,\nRococo began importing\nsmall quantities to sell in their\nshops in London. When two\nhurricanes hit the island of\nGrenada in 2004 and 2005,\ndestroying the majority of\ncocoa and nutmeg, Rococo\nreached out to GCC, providing support, funding new\nsolar driers and building new\nbridges. In 2007, they finally\npurchasing a small, nine-acre cocoa farm, naming it\nGrococo, where it harvested\nfine flavoured, organic cocoa\nbeans.\nOur minds were snapped\nback to the present with the\nend of the story. But that was\njust the start of something\nexciting \u2013 a chocolate\nmasterclass!\nWe were led downstairs to\nthe small workshop, filling in\nthe space around the shiny,\nmarble tabletop. Aprons (in\nthat gorgeous print of course)\nand gloves were distributed,\nand the truffle-making half of\nthe session began. Chantal\nquickly rolled out the squares\nof chocolate ganache into\nspheres, dolloped a spoonful\nof warm molten chocolate\nin the palm of her hand,\ncovering the ganache with the\nchocolate and placed the ball\ninto a tray of cocoa powder.\nThe molten chocolate cooled\nto formed a crisp layer\naround the cold ganache. We\nwere urged to follow, rolling\nour individual trays of truffles.\nThe second part was a\nmore advanced technique \u2013\ntempering. By bringing the\n\\\\ By bringing\nthe chocolate to\nthe right working\ntemperature, the\ncocoa butter forms\na stable crystalline\nstructure in the\nchocolate, resulting\nin hardness and\ngloss in the final\nproduct \\\\\nchocolate to the right working\ntemperature, the cocoa butter\nforms a stable crystalline\nstructure in the chocolate,\nresulting in hardness and\ngloss in the final product.\nChantal took a large ladleful\nof glossy, molten chocolate,\npouring it on the cold marble\ntable. The chocolate formed\na smooth, flowing ribbon\nfrom the ladle to the marble,\nspreading to form a giant,\nperfectly circular chocolate\nbutton. She took her shiny\nsteel scrapers, scraping the\nliquid gold from the edge to\nthe center, working around\nthe circle with skill and\nspeed. The temperature had\nto be precise, meaning the\nmixture had to be warmed\nup by adding more molten\nchocolate or cooled down by\nadding solids. With the tempered chocolate, we made\nour own chocolate buttons\nand lattice work, using some\nsilver transfer she had made\nbefore.\nWith our fingers sticky\nwith chocolate, we were led\nback up to the dining table\nfor another unique experience \u2013 cheese and chocolate\npairing.\nCheese? Why not? Platters\nof chocolate slabs with their\npaired cheeses were passed\naround: Lancashire with\ncardamom white chocolate,\nBerkswell with a sea salt,\nalmond and rosemary milk\nchocolate, and Stichelton with\ntheir single origin Dominican\nRepublic dark chocolate, plus\na sneaky sip of a ten-year\nHazelburn Speyside whiskey.\nWe nibbled on the combina-tions, concentrating on the\nthrilling palette of flavours\non our tongues. It was a\nsurprising match, especially\nthe Lancashire with the sweet,\nmilky white chocolate and the\nexotic hints of cardamom.\nWe also tried other flavoured chocolates they had,\nwith the most memorable one\nbeing George\u2019s Marvelous\nMedicine. Sound familiar?\nYes, the name of one of Roald\nDahl\u2019s most loved books. They\nhad collaborated with Roald\nDahl in his centenary year\nand came up with a range\nof chocolates inspired by his\nbooks. The creatives had studied the stories back to front\nand front to back, picking up\nsections, sentences, pictures\nand words for inspiration.\nAnd for this particular bar,\nthey exchanged the Golden\nGloss Hair Shampoo, toothpaste and Superfoam shaving\ncream with an enticing mix of\naniseed, liquorice and fennel,\ncreating a marvelously medicinal taste.\nWith our minds full of newfound chocolate knowledge,\nand stomachs full of cheese,\nquality chocolate and tons\nof creativity, we left the shop\n(with more chocolate) feeling\nmuch more inspired than the\nprevious Wednesdays.\nTime for me to start reconsidering my goals in life.\n\n"

Ourwriter,\nEzra Kitson, was fortunate\nenough to speak with her after\nthe performance.\nEdmundson was drawn\nto puppetry by a National\nTheatre production of Phillip\nPullman\u2019s His Dark Materials\nwhere she realised the power\nof puppetry in storytelling.\n\"Puppets require the audience\nto use their empathy\" and \"do\naway with the ego\" of conventional performance. After\npursuing a drama degree\nwhere she cemented her love\nfor the theatre, Edmundson, a\ngraduate of Queen Mary\u2019s,\nundertook a a ten week\ncourse at the Curious School\nof Puppetry, an institution\nshe believes \u201cwill have an\nenormous part to play in the\ngrowth of puppetry in the\nUK\u201d . Since her time at the\nCurious School, she has taken\nshows to Edinburgh Fringe\nand honed her craft on the\nMovingstage Marionette\nTheatre on the Puppet Theatre\nBarge, a barge moored in\nLittle Venice.\nHer previous work has\ntackled complex issues that\nyou may not associate with\npuppetry. Earlier this year\nshe staged The Old Woman\nMade of Stardust at the N16\nTheatre, a story about a\nyoung girl struggling to navigate her grief after the death\nof her grandmother, based\npartially on a letter Edmundson\u2019s grandmother wrote to\nher before she passed away.\nAlong with other puppeteers,\nshe has been involved in\nWondering Hands, a puppet\ncompany that staged a show\nof the same name at the\nBrainchild Festival in July this\nyear. Wondering Hands, the\nshow, is a piece that aims\nto fill the void left by lack of\nrelevant, useful sex education provided by schools. It\nexplores \"consent, gender\nand sexuality\", using puppets\nas an \"accessible edge\" into\na subject that is often either\nveiled in analogy or misrepresented in explicit, exploitative\npornography.\nThe Little Matchgirl at the\nSam Wanamaker Playhouse is perhaps the most\nmainstream attention she\u2019s\nthe themes in the play are\ntoo dark for a Christmas per-formance? \"Not at all, these\nstories have a very important\nmessage, particularly to hear\nat Christmas.

What\nis the value of a collectible\npiece of porcelain, of a script\nyou\u2019ve been working on for\nten years, of a seat on a boat\nthat is as likely to plunge\nyou into the sea as to deliver\nyou to safety? In the one-hour, one man show, DaleJones explores these issues,\nboth personal and global,\nwith humour, empathy, and\nconsiderable power.\nDale-Jones greets each\naudience member as they\narrive at the relatively small\nvenue of Jerwood Theatre\nUpstairs with a handshake\nand a word of thanks, when\neveryone has taken their seat,\nhe takes his own place at a\ndesk set up on stage. In The\nRoyal Court, the desk is at the\nfront of a timber box, not his\nown set, Dale-Jones tells the\naudience, but that of the show\nthat will be following him; it is\nthis spirit of frugality of stag-ing, this camp-fire story vibe\nthat characterises the rest of\nthe performance. Dale-Jones\nvoices all his characters of\nwhich there are few; himself,\nhis mother, his script writing\ninstructor, as well some others\nwho appear fleetingly in the\nretelling. From a laptop, he\nalso adds a soundtrack; a fun\nmix of pop music that sets the\nscene, as well as a dramatic\nscore for a the more tense\nmoments of the story.\n\u2018The Duke\u2019 Dale-Jones\ntells us, refers to a 'Royal\nWorcester limited edition\nporcelain figure of the Duke\nof Wellington on horseback',\none of a set of four, a figurine\nthat was bought by his late\nfather as an investment at a\nsum of \u00a3750 (over \u00a38000\nin today\u2019s money), when\nDale-Jones was young.The\nDuke remained bound in\nsponge under the bed, the\nfocus of father-son bonding\nthroughout Dale-Jones\u2019 child-hood.This is the background,\nthe audience are told. The\nstory proper follows that of\nDale-Jones deciding whether\nto make crucial changes to\na script that he has been\nworking on for a decade \u2013\nchanges that would offer a\nchance to get it turned into a\nfilm. The changes demanded\nare outlandish; Anglesey\nmust become Manhattan,\nthe principal character must\nchange all of their distinguishing features, and the script\nIndira Mallik\n\\\\ Dale-Jones is\na consummate\nstoryteller, able to\nconjure up scenes\nand characters out\nof thin air before\nthe audience's eyes,\nin telling his story\nhe is creating real\nchange in a world in\ndesperate need of\nit \\\\\nThe Duke is on at the\nJerwood Theatre (Royal\nCourt Theatre) until the 14th\nof\nFebruary 2017\nTickets are free (all donations go to\nSave the Children)\nThe Duke is structured around the loss of\nthe \"Royal Worcester limited edition porcelain figure of the Duke of Wellington on\nhorseback\"\n\\\\ rubylane.com\nshould heavily feature Audi\nTT coupes.

Thus begins a\ntale recounting the recovery\nof The Duke of Wellington,\nDale-Jones\u2019 realisation of how\ntreasured his time with his\nmother has become now he\nsees that it is limited.\n\u201cI am no longer able to see\nthe world I once did,\" admits\nDale-Jones at the beginning\nof the performance. The\naudience is sombre, none\nof us can. Throughout the\nretelling of The Duke, new\nreports of Syrian refugees\nhaunt Dale-Jones as he waits\nfor an work email, he hears of\nseveral families drowning off\nthe Greek coast, and thinks of\nhow much they must've paid\nfor a chance to get on the\nboat in the first place: their\nentire life savings perhaps,\nat one point he encounters a\nyoung refugee mother, and is\nlost as to how to reply when\nshe tells him she does not\nknow whether her husband is\nalive or dead. In one of the\nmost emotional scenes, at the\nend, he watches his elderly\nmother who has joined a\nrowing club, get into a boat\n\u2013 a moment of empowerment\nfor her \u2013 and thinks of all the\nmothers for whom the action\nis not a matter of staving off\nloneliness, but of life and\ndeath.\nThe story, simple at its core,\nhas fantastical flourishes.\nDale-Jones explains these\nwith a Louis Bu\u00f1uel quote\nat the start of the perfor-mance: \"Fantasy and reality\nare equally personal, and\nequally felt, so their confusion\nis only a matter of relative\nimportance.\" In this spirit,\nimagination and truth are\nblended in the retelling of\nDale-Jones\u2019 accounts; some\ndetails are far fetched, but\neach new twist is told with\nsuch clarity, such earnestness,\nthat it doesn\u2019t matter, it is\nindistinguishable from what\nmay actually have happened.\nThe Duke is a tour de force\nperformance, revealing\nDale-Jones as a consummate\nstoryteller, able to conjure up\nscenes and characters out of\nthin air before the audience\u2019s\neyes. He is persuasive too;\nthe need to urgently do\nsomething about the crises\nthe world finds itself in is\nmade clear; but Dale-Jones\nisn\u2019t lecturing from the top\nof his \u201cliberal elite\u201d ivory\ntower; tickets to The Duke are\nfree, after the performance,\ncollection buckets for Save\nthe Children are handed\naround. The Duke is about\nthe worth of things; objects,\nexperiences, it shows us the\nworth of art \u2013 the power it\nhas to spin something out\nof nothing and create real\nchange in the world. Real\ncharity, Dale-Jones tells the\naudience is \"when it hurts just\na bit.\" Dale-Jones could've\ncharged market price for\nthe tickets and donated his\nearnings, instead he uses The\nDuke to ask each audience\nmember personally: what are\nyou willing to pay for chance\nto make the a world a little bit\nbetter?\n\n"

It\ninvolves stimulating the part\nof the brain that is linked\nto reward and pleasure.\nPatients undergoing treatment\nfor depression may receive\nnumerous sessions of TMS, but\nit is unknown as to whether\ntheir sex drive is altered as a\nresult.\nA new study directly looking\nat libido suggests that this\nmay be the case. The area of\nthe brain involved in pleasure\nwas stimulated in 20 people\nfor 20 minutes. This involved\nstrapping a vibrator to either\nthe penis or clitoris of the\nvolunteer, and monitoring the\nstrength of alpha brain waves\nvia electrodes attached to\nthe individual\u2019s head. Alpha\nwaves are generally weaker\nduring sexual arousal. This\ngroup was split into two: one\nreceived excitatory TMS, and\nthe other inhibitory. In other\nwords, the excitatory group\nhad the pleasure region of\ntheir brain stimulated while\nthe other did not.\nThe researchers then monitored the effects of sexual\narousal on the level of sexual\ndesire. Each volunteer was\nleft alone in a room, with\na vibrator that they could\ncontrol themselves. They\nhad to press the button as\nquickly as possible when a\nshape appeared on a screen.\nDepending on their speed\nof response, they would be\nstimulated after a pause.\nThe strength of the alpha\nwaves during this waiting\nperiod were the most important find. Individuals that were\npart of the excitatory group\nhad weaker alpha waves\nthan those that were not. They\nwere more sexually aroused\nwith the expectation of stim-ulation. Therefore, the brain\nwaves can be seen as an analogue to sexual desire, and so\nSpotted|Theseagullofnightmares\nF\nor most, a visit to\nHyde Park engenders\nfeelings of tranquility\nand relaxation.\nGoing for a walk in\nthis urban wilderness\nat the heart of London\nwould provide anyone with\nthe \u201cescape\u201d that we city\ndwellers crave, whether we\nknow it or not. As a biologist,\nI certainly identify myself as\na regular park visitor, always\nadmiring the flora, observing\nwildlife and I\u2019ve come to\nfamiliarize myself with the\necosystem. However, nothing\ncould have prepared me for\nwhat I witnessed a few weeks\nago.\nI had just arrived at the Serpentine Bar when I stopped\nfor a bit of bird watching.\nAfter some time, a lone\nseagull stealthily approached\none group of pigeons on the\nshore. This did not seem\nout of the norm until the\ngull suddenly sprinted\nat the smallest of\nthe pack, dragged\nthe poor creature\ninto the water and\nbegan viciously\npecking at it. At first,\nthis seemed like a\nterritorial attack, but\nas the assault persisted,\nit became clear the intention was to kill. It felt like a\nhorrific scene out of Planet\nEarth. The encounter lasted\nfor around ten minutes. Unexpectedly, the seagull went\non to eat its victim, which, as\nyou can imagine, did nothing\nto help my now greatly disturbed psyche. It felt like I\u2019d\njust witnessed murder. Nonetheless, my scientific nature\nwas curious to know why this\nwas happening.\nA local birdwatcher, Ralph\nHancock, had also taken notice\nof this notorious creature, having\nfirst spotted it over five years\nago. As it turns out, seagulls\nare known to develop new\nhunting strategies if their\nexisting methods are\nunsuccessful, however,\nin this case, there was\nno clear motivation for\nchange in eating habits.\nDue to their webbed\nfeet, they do not have the\nstrength to hold, let alone kill,\na pigeon on the ground, hence\ndrowning them in water. This gull\nstarted out by diving onto prey\nflying below from the top of the\nSerpentine Bar. This technique\nwas, however, insufficient, leading the bird to switch to running\nat prey on the shore and dragging them into the water.\nInterestingly, some North\nLara Bailey explores how brain stimulation can affect our libidos\nAmerican gull populations\nhave been observed eating\nneighboring chicks, because\nfish, their main food source,\nhave followed plankton to\ndeeper colder waters in\nresponse to rising temper-atures.

If the first thing you do when\nyou introduce yourself to a stranger is shit all\nover their work, then you\u2019re really just asking\nfor your bike seat to be stolen. So maybe you\njust need to look within. Ask yourself \u201cWho\nhurt me?\u201d and as soon as you have your\nanswer, track them down and hurt them back\nbecause I don\u2019t want to be the receiver of all\nthese bad vibe. Nope. Deal with your shit.\nStop being so angry.\nBig luv,\nChris xxxxx\nO\nbviously I\u2019m not\nwell versed in\nqueer-speak, so\nI had to send\na telegram to\nthe nearest\ntrading post in order to get one\nof those Indians to research on a\ncomputer for me. It seems that,\nsadly, many of today\u2019s children\nare deluded and are making\nup words like \u2018intersectionality\u2019,\n\u2018tweet\u2019, or \u2018transsexual\u2019, and it\nis just sad to see their grip upon\nreality slowly disappear. Frankly,\nif the word isn\u2019t in the Bible then it\nisn\u2019t actually a word and shouldn\u2019t\nbe featured in a newspaper, but\nsince this newspaper is edited by a\nknown homosexual, I believe that\nall traces of credibility have truly\nbeen lost.\nLet\u2019s face it people, multiculturalism just doesn\u2019t work. I will dumb\nthis idea down into an idea that\nyou stupid millennials will under-stand: If I have a WKD and I piss in\nit, you can still taste the WKD, and\nin fact it may initially taste better,\nbut after a while you will realise\nthat the original WKD you had\nis now just a warm bottle of piss\nand unless you are stranded in the\njungle liked I was in Vietnam, you\nwill not want to drink it. Still can\u2019t\nbelieve it was over 50 years ago. I\ncan still remember looking for the\nViet Cong. Darkness. The smell of\nblood. FLASHING. PAIN. KILL ALL\nVIETNAMESE. GLOBAL WARMING IS A CHINESE CONSPIRACY.\nSorry. Furthermore, intersection-ality can\u2019t work mostly for the fact\nthat all of the browns seem to eat\nstrange food. How can we decide\nwhere to invade if their food\nis completely unpalatable to a\nnormal palate. Also what is it with\ntheir lot and covering their women?\nI mean, don\u2019t get me wrong, I\nhaven\u2019t suffered a brain injury and\nawoken a feminist. I only wonder\nas to why they want to cover\nwomen when what they want is\nto be looked at by men. You see,\nwomen thrive on attention and\nwhen you deprive them of it they\nbecome inconsolable and start to\ncry. Why can\u2019t these Islamists dress\nnormally like Christians? I mean\napart from nuns, we don\u2019t force\nwomen to cover up at any point.\nIf you speak another language,\nplease keep it private. I can\u2019t\nbear the thought of our children\nbeing exposed to other cultures\nand languages, slowly becoming\nindoctrinated into the fundamentalist culture of the Islamic Caliphate\nof Birmingham. In fact the other\nday I heard a white child say the\nphrase \u201csalaam alaikum\u201d, and I\nwas seconds away from shooting\nit in the face before someone told\nme it was sand-speak for hello. If\nwe are to have a culture where\nwe can trust everyone, then all\nthe non-white people need to\nstart speaking in English so I can\nunderstand what they\u2019re saying.\nOtherwise you can\u2019t get annoyed\nat us for stopping you at customs.\nI\nntersectionality. Sundry.\nCajole. All three of these\nwords are ones that I did\nnot know until I quickly\ngoogled them, and despite\nonly skim reading the\ndefinition on dictionary.com, I now\nbelieve I have a sound enough\nunderstanding of them in order\nto write a portentous think piece.\nIntersectionality comes from the\nroots \u2018Inter-\u2019 and \u2018-sectionality\u2019\nand means if you put two things\ntogether they should fit together,\neven if you need to force one of\nthe tabs into the other slots to get\nthem to coexist. I hear from my less\neco-aware friends that this is how\nIkea furniture works; however, I\nrefuse to have any furniture in my\nflat that isn\u2019t made completely out\nof reconstituted Brazilian elephant\nfaeces. I just feel closer to the\nanimals that way.\nIn times of struggle I often look to\nour Lord and saviour Owen Jones,\nand indeed dear readers, as I was\nstanding in the hummus section\nof Whole Foods, did I need to\nlook upon his boyish face which I\nkeep in my wallet. It was at Whole\nFoods that I came across a travesty\nupon our society. It turns out that\nrich people are actually allowed\nin Whole Foods now and I can\u2019t\nbelieve that we would allow this\nmix of diversity. This is the wrong\ntype of diversity. The diversity we\nshould have should be of all the\nnationalities of the world, as long\nas they speak English of course,\nas I simply don\u2019t have the time to\ninteract with another culture on\ntheir own terms.\nI was on High Street Kensington,\nand for some reason a woman\nwearing a large fur coat thought\nthat she could mix with me, a\nperson who has rejected the\nconsumerism of the modern world\n(apart from smoothies because I\nfucking love them) as it didn\u2019t suit\nmy artisanal vegan cheese and\npoetry lifestyle. You see I can\u2019t\ntolerate rich people because, well,\nthey\u2019re just not like me. They have\noften grown up in an environment\nand a culture that they had no\npart in choosing; however, this is\ndifferent as to what I grew up with\nand so naturally I must resent them\nfor this.\nIf anything, the one branch of\nintersectionality that I think we\nare not exploring deep enough is\nthat of the relationship between\nman and sheep. Why is this a joke\nto people? Historically the Welsh\nhave always had this sort of inter-sectionality that I wish was deemed\nacceptable within English society.\nOnly can we be truly free and\naccepting as a society when we\naccept that a relationship between\na man and a sheep, maybe even a\nlamb, is as natural as freshly made\nbaba ganoush. Wait a second.\nApparently intersectionality isn\u2019t\nspelt inter-sex-tionality? I hope the\ncopy-editors pick up on that.\nWe need diversity,\nbut I shouldn\u2019t have\nto change\nJonathan Masters wants more\nacceptance of those he deems\nacceptable\nMulticulturalism\ndoesn\u2019t work, they\nshould just be like us\nMonathan Jasters explains why\nwe need to go back to the golden\nage of the Bible\nS\nV\n* Sponsored by\nDonaldTrump\n\n"

Blah.Blah.Blah\nfelixonline.co. uk /comment comment.felix@ic.ac.uk\nThe people who\ntravel on long-distance buses are\nall freaks\nTessa Davey explores what it is about\ncoach travel that makes people so\ninconsiderate.\nT\nhere are three types\nof people who take\novernight coaches:\nthe stupid, those\ntrying to fulfil a\nstereotype, and the\ndesperate.\nThis seems like a bold\nstatement, I know, but let\nme explain. You see, I fall\ninto one of these categories\n(stupid, certainly), lured in\nby Megabus\u2019 \u00a311 ticket to\nAmsterdam, and I always\nobserve the same things.\nIt seems like a great deal.\nYou\u2019ll get on a coach in the\nevening, read a book, fall\nasleep, and wake up the next\nday in a European city of your\ndreams, having spent less\nthan the price of two drinks in\na central London bar. You\u2019ll\narrive rested, rejuvenated,\nand ready to explore. What\nwill actually happen is that\nyou\u2019ll arrive (inevitably, at\naround 6am) at a foreign bus\nstation which will invariably\nbe miles from the centre of the\ncity, in the roughest possible\narea imaginable. You\u2019ll be\nfreezing (no matter what\ntime of the year it is), and will\nalmost certainly be stiff and\ngrumpy from the journey, and\nexhausted from having spent\nthe night awake, enraged at\nyour fellow passengers. Plus\nyou\u2019ll probably really need\nto pee, the toilet having been\nout of action for the second\nhalf of the journey, causing\ndistress both to everyone\u2019s\nbladders and nasal passages.\nI\u2019ve never had a successful\nfirst day after this, and I\u2019ve\nnever failed to swear never\ndo it again \u2013 a promise that\nlasts until I get excited about\nthe next European destination.\nThis, ladies and gentlemen, is\nwhy I am one of the stupid.\nMaybe the bus journey in\nitself would be bearable were\nit not of the people on the bus.\nAnd yes, if you\u2019re travelling\non a long-distance coach, you\nare one of these awful people.\nThere\u2019s something about\nbus stations that removes all\nsense of normal decency.\nNowhere else would the level\nof aggression and selfishness\nbe acceptable, and each\nperson\u2019s sense of boundaries\nchanges so dramatically in\nresponse to this. In Victoria\nCoach Station two weeks\nago, a man spat at me and\nanother deliberately hit my\nshins with his umbrella while\nI was waiting patiently to get\non a bus. Even I\u2019ve been know\nto take off most of my clothes,\nhave a wash with baby wipes,\nand put on new clothes, all\nwhile viciously defending my\nplace in a queue to get on a\nFlixbus in a Paris bus station (I\nmay have snarled at someone\n\u2013 I take my right to first dibs on\na window seat seriously).\nThis isn\u2019t something that I\ndo in Sainsbury\u2019s while I\u2019m\nwaiting to pay for my weekly\nshop, but it feels perfectly\nnormal and acceptable in a\nbus station in the middle of\nthe night. Yes I know, I am\ncontributing to the horrible\nexperience of bus travel.\nBut yet I am somewhat\nconsiderate: I have the\ndecency to make sure that I\nam fresh and clean (at least\nas much as possible) before\nembarking on twelve hours\npacked like sardines with\nfifty other people, one whose\npersonal space you will violate\njust by existing in the space\nnext to them. But not everyone\ndoes this, be it because they\ndon\u2019t care to, or they can\u2019t.\nAnd these are the desperate.\nThe ones who need to make\nthis journey and can only\nafford to do it by bus. They\u2019re\ntravelling to see loved ones, or\nto achieve their dreams. I can\u2019t\nreally blame the desperate\nfor their unpreventable\ncontribution to the hell that is\ninternational coach travel, but\nI can place some sort of blame\non anyone who demonstrates\nan avoidable lack of personal\nhygiene and respect for their\nfellow passengers.\nWhat about the poor\nstudents, I hear you cry?\nWhere do they come in? Well,\nif they really can\u2019t afford an\nextra couple of tenners for a\nmuch more pleasant budget\nflight, then by all means, stick\nthem on a coach, and maybe\nsend them a link to a money\nmanagement guide. Usually\nthough, they\u2019re taking the\ncoach out of some desire to be\nthe image of what they think\na student should be: creatives\ntravelling on a shoestring,\nwearing thrift store bargains\nthey picked up in Budapest,\nsporting silly haircuts, reading\nKafka and listening to Kate\nBush. They have a romantic\nidea that they are building\ncharacter; their pretentious\nsullen faces as they sulkily\nwait at passport control\nat Calais tell you that they\nthink they\u2019re better than you.\nTheir misguided arrogance\nis amusing for about five\nminutes, but no one wants to\nbe stuck in a confined space\nwith them for 24 hours.\nIn other countries and\ncontinents, bus travel seems\nto be more tolerable and\nless dominated by this kind\nof degenerates, but as soon\nas there\u2019s an long-distance\ncoach passing through\nLondon Victoria, the quality\nof the clientele plummets. So\nwhy bother? It\u2019s literally not\nworth it when you could pay\nan extra \u00a330 to be there in\na tenth of the time. Do me a\nfavour and fly, so that when\nI\u2019m stupid enough to take the\nbus, I at least have a bit more\nspace.\n\\\\ Even I\u2019ve been\nknow to take off\nmost of my clothes,\nhave a wash with\nbaby wipes, and\nput on new clothes,\nall while viciously\ndefending my\nplace in a queue to\nget on a Flixbus \\\\\n\\\\ In other countries, bus\ntravel seems to be more\ntolerable and less dominated\nby this kind of degenerates \\\\\n\\\\ If they really\ncan\u2019t afford an\nextra couple\nof tenners for\na much more\npleasant budget\nflight, then stick\nthem on a coach\nand send them a\nlink to a money\nmanagement\nguide \\\\\n\\\\ I\u2019ve never failed\nto swear never to\ndo it again \u2013 until\nI get excited about\nthe next European\ndestination \\\\\n\n"
