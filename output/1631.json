You\nlook back and realise that it will stay\nwith you for many years to come, as\na glowing memory in your life. This\nyear\u2019s weekend away has been one\nof those moments for us!\nOn the Friday evening a group\nof tired Imperial students gathered\naround a blue minibus, chatting\namiably, with a quiet buzz of\nexcitement permeating the air.\nWaking up bright and early on\nSaturday at 8.30, breakfast was an\nassortment of brioche, croissants,\nmuesli,fruit yoghurt and the various\npermutations there-of.Whilst every\none broke their fast Sophie began,\nwhat would become, her famous\n\u2018Sing Along with Sophie\u2019 routine,\nconsisting of a series of repetitive,\ncatchy tunes that were designed to\nirritate you for weeks to come.\nOnce we were all suitably\nwarmed up we dived straight into\nSea Sketches by Grace Williams.\nHonestly, this is an incredible\npiece and unmissable for any fans\nof program music out there. It was\ncomposed by a woman (sadly a\nrarity among famous composers)\nfrom Wales in 1944 for string\norchestra.\nEvery club or society has that\nweird game they play like \u2018the\npairs game\u2019 or the \u2018peg\u2019 game. Well,\nICSE kicked off the incomparable\n\u2018which vegetable am I\u2019game.Players\nwould pose as they depicted a\nvegetable using only their body, and\nparticularly, their facial expression.\nResults were mixed but Samuel\u2019s\ncelery was especially admirable!\nAs the full light of Sunday\nbloomed, ICSE members struggled\nout of sleeping bags and into\nbreakfast.This time a more subdued\naffair,albeit with the singing entirely\nintact.\nArriving at the church we were\npleased to find it both heated AND\nwith toilets, which was a marked\nimprovement on the year before.\nThe concert as a whole was very\nwell played with solid performances\nin both the Sea Sketches and the\nBrandenburg, so well in fact that we\ndid an encore of Sailing song from\nthe Sea Sketches; the last of the\nA very happy ensemble on a very successful trip! Photo Credit: Jonathan Rawlinson\nThe\nmoment of\nclosure as\nsomething\nwonderful\ncomes to\nan end\nImperial College String Ensemble\nICSE fills us in on their weekend away\nthree we performed.\nPulling into the union around\n6-7pm we unloaded, unpacked,\nparked the bus and decided it was\ntime to go home. Right proper job\nall round. The weekend was over,\nand as we contemplated the week\nahead, we could feel that this had\nbeen a time we would remember for\nyears to come and look back on with\ngreat fondness and affection. Thank\nyou ICSE for making this possible.\nIf you are interested in coming\nand listening to ICSE, all FELIX\nreaders are very welcome to come\nto our Spring concert on Friday\nthe 18th\nof March at 19:30 in Holy\nTrinity Church, South Kensington.\nWe hope to see you there!\nJONATHAN RAWLINSON\nEnding term on a high note (or several!)\nIt's officially performance season again for the arts societies at Imperial\nA\nfter the all round success\nseen at ArtsFest last term\nfor the Arts societies\nImperial has seen them\ncome roaring back to life for a series\nof incredible Easter term concerts.\nICSM Drama put on a wonderful\nperformance of Midsummer Night\u2019s\ndream in the Union Concert Hall\nlast week with snazzy costumes, set\nand performances. The PhotoSoc\nexhibition has been up in the Blythe\ngallery since the launch last week\nand it\u2019s pretty incredible. The free\nwine and cheese at the launch was\nalso pretty incredible, if we\u2019re being\ncompletey honest.\nAs we\u2019ve already seen in FELIX\nC&S, there\u2019s the Dance Imperial\nshow coming up this weekend\n(17th\n-19th\nMarch) which is set\nto be a phenomenal six dance\nsociety collaboration.

In 2009, she\nbecame the first woman\nto become Head of the Physics\nDepartment. As she\u2019s eager to say\nherself, \u201cIt\u2019s a great department and\na lot of fantastic science is going on\nhere.\u201d\nRecently she\u2019s become co-director\nof Imperial\u2019s Grantham Institute\nwhere she invests resources in\npeople, workshops and students, as\nwell as informs the Government\nabout science. Haigh is additionally\na Fellow of the Royal Society and\nin 2013 was appointed a CBE, both\ngreat honours.\nHaigh\u2019s reputation further\ndemonstrates her importance at\nImperial and for women in STEM\nstriving for academic recognition.\nHer advice to women: \u201cif you\u2019re\ninterested then just go for it, don\u2019t\nbe put off.\u201d\nCurrently, her research involves\nmeasuring how changes in the\nSun\u2019s ultraviolet (UV) radiation\naffects our planet\u2019s climate. Most\nof the radiation is absorbed by the\nstratosphere.\nHowever novel research has been\ninvestigating how UV radiation\nmight influence the atmosphere\nbelow. So, Haigh has been focusing\non how the changes in the\nstratospherecanaffecttheweatherat\nthe surface. She studies the changes\nin the momentum driving the\nwinds in the stratosphere and how\nNatasha Khaleeq\nWritter\nWomen of Imperial: Professor Jo Haigh\nthat compares to the atmospheric\ncirculations below. Haigh\u2019s results\nsuggest that when the Sun is more\nactive, the storm tracks (high speed\nwinds pulling the storms across the\nAtlantic) move slightly closer to the\npoles, whereas when the sun is less\nactive, they tend to move slightly\ncloser to the equator.\nThis suggests that middle latitude\nareas where storm tracks appear,\nexperience the effect the strongest.\nSo, when the sun is less active,\nyou\u2019re more likely to get a colder\nwinter. Therefore, the UK\u2019s climate\nexperiences small but significant\neffects from the solar cycle.\nAs put by Haigh, this research\n\u201chelps us understand what natural\nfactors are influencing the climates\nthat are separate from human\nfactors.\u201d Professor Joanna Haigh.

These red light\nflashes are, well, just that \u2013 flashes\nthat last a fraction of a second, as\nmatter spurs from the black hole.\nV404 Cygni was the first black\nhole to be identified in our galaxy,\nbut from June 2015 onwards, the\nblack hole brightened in dramatic\nsporadic bursts, providing new\ninsights into the formation of such\njets and the working of black holes.\nLead author Dr Poshak Gandhi,\nAssociate Professor and STFC\nErnest Rutherford fellow at the\nUniversity of Southampton explains\n\u201cthe high speed tells us that the\nregion where this red light is being\nemitted must be very compact.\nPiecing together clues about the\ncolour, speed and the power of these\nflashes,we conclude that this light is\nbeing emitted from the base of the\nblack hole jet\u201d. Black holes just got\na little bit brighter.\nGandhi et al 2016 @ Oxford\nJournals\nBlack hole\nflashes red\nImagine a world absent of oxygen.\nSuffocating,no? Until about 3.5-3.8\nbillion years ago, our fossil records\nindicates that photosynthesis was a\nprocess which simply did not exist.\nA reaction,which now seems simple;\na process taking sugar and water,\nusing the sun's energy to produce\noxygen. Scientists pinpointed this\nrevolution, responsible for a great\nleap in terms of species quantity and\ndiversity, to the basking bacteria of\nMorning Glory Pool, Yellowstone\nNational Park. These bacteria use a\nprimitive form of photosynthesis,\none which does not produce oxygen,\nand were till recently thought by\nscientists to be the first life forms\nwhich did so. However, study\nauthor Dr Tanai Cardona, from\nthe Department of Life Sciences at\nImperial College London, claims\nthat \u201cthe picture that is starting to\nemerge is that during the first half\nof Earth\u2019s history, the majority of\nlife forms were probably capable of\nphotosynthesis\u201d. Photosynthesis is\nlikely to have occurred in bacterial\nspecies, before those around today.\nCardona 2016 @ Plos One\nPhotosynthetic\npast revealed\nBreast milk or\nbottle?\nAs the number of mums seeking\nalternatives to natural breastfeeding\nincreases, the demand for artificial\ninfant milk sources similarly rises.\nScientists are put under more and\nmore pressure to develop a formula\nwhich can measure up to the natural\nstuff. It is widely known that breast-fedinfantsshowreducedeczemaand\nallergy risk compared to those fed by\nbottle. However, many studies have\nclaimed hydrolysed milk formulas\nhelp reduce the mitigating impacts\nof bottle feeding, closing the health\nbenefit gap between milk from the\nbreast compared to milk from the\nbottle. To further investigate these\nclaims, a recent study conducted\nby the Department of Medicine at\nImperial College London, analysed\n19,000 participants, and found\nno evidence supporting them.\nPublication bias is thought to have\npreviously found this supposed link\nbetween the hydrolysed formula and\na reduced infant risk to eczema and\nallergies. Once again the scientific\ncommunity has come under scrutiny.\nBoyle et al 2016 @ the BMJ\nM\nechanically patching\nup a \u2018broken\u2019 heart\nmay soon be possible\nthanks to Tal\nDvir and Ron Feiner. They have\nintegrated electronics with living\ntissues to produce the \u201ccyborg\nheart patch\u201d. The patch acts like an\norgan, but is powered by a machine,\nregulating heart contraction and\nexpansion. With 25% of patients\non the US waiting list dying before\ngetting a heart transplant, this\nmedicinal technological revolution\nhas the potential to save millions of\nlives, as the patch can replace any\ndamaged heart tissue. In addition,\nthe patch enables real-time\nmonitoring of the patient's heart\nrate, and can intervene to modify\nheart pace and activate regenerative\ndrugs if required from afar. Practical\nimplications of the technology,\nhowever, may take some time.\nFeiner et al 2016 @Nature materials\nMechanical\nheartbreak fix\nTurns out humans are not the\nonly junk food lovers. Scientists at\nthe University of East Anglia have\nobserved a complete behavioural\nchange in storks brought about by\nhuman activity, and the momentous\namount of waste that we produce.\nStorks have thrown in the towel for\nmaintaining their active lifestyle.\nThe Europe to Africa winter annual\ntrip is proving to be too much of an\neffort. Lounging around on landfill\nsites, gauging on leftover bargain\nbuckets does seem like a good\ncompromise. However this lifestyle\nis very temperamental, with new\nEU directives scheduled to turn\nsuch landfill sites to new facilities\nwhereby the food waste will be\nhandled under cover, forcing storks\nfrom their couch potato lifestyle.\nAll sarcasm aside, this will cause\nproblems for the storks as they will\nneed to find an alternative winter\nfood supply; a problem which\nwill affect chick fledging success,\nmigratory decisions, breeding\nlocations and stork distributions.\nGilber et al 2016 @BioMed Central\nSkip diving\nstorks in trouble\n\n"

What this means\nfor the service\u2019s customers is that\nyou are effectively confined to\nwatching what is available in your\nown country. This is an issue for\nsubscribers basically anywhere\nexcept the US where the catalogue\nof available material is vastly\nsuperior. It remains to be seen,\nhowever, whether this was the right\ndecision for them. Immediately\nafter the announcement, there\nwas the expected internet outrage\nwith people saying this move was\nludicrous and that they would be\ncancelling their subscriptions. This,\nof course, quickly subsided. But\nthe issue at the heart of the dissent\nremains; is it still worth having a\nNetflix subscription?\nNetflix topped the end of 2015\nwith almost 75 million subscribers,\ndwarfing its rivals, Amazon\nPrime and Hulu Plus. One could\neasily, however, expect a drop\nin subscriptions after effectively\noffering less for every customer.\nThis move came as the result\nof increasing pressure from the\ntraditional TV companies (mainly\nin the US) that have been trying to\neffect of so many more streaming\nservices opening, with exclusivity\ncontracts.With this diluting what is\navailable on each, and making each\nof them a lesser value for money, it\ncould be that we are reaching the\nend of a golden age on television\nstreaming where so much was\navailable at such low cost.\nNetflix\u2019s pre-emptive response\nto this has been to funnel huge\namounts of money into their\noriginal programming, with\ntheir Chief Content Officer Ted\nSarandos claiming that they\u2019re\n\u201creleasing more shows in the next\nquarter than many networks will\nin a whole year\u201d. 2015 saw their\nfirst foray into feature length films,\nwith Beasts of No Nation and Adam\nSandler\u2019s Ridiculous 6 as well as\ngoing into more traditional, family\nstifle Netflix\u2019s growing popularity\nby restricting its access to many of\ntheir shows. HBO has notably been\ndoing this, now offering its own\nstreaming service HBOGo in direct\ncompetition. However, it remains\nonly available in the US, opting to\ninstead sell their library of shows to\ninternational broadcasters: to Sky in\nthe case of the UK.There is also the\nto finesse their way into the Marvel\nCinematic Universe with the\ncritically acclaimed Daredevil and\nJessica Jones, with at least three more\nrelated series to follow in the next\nfew years. It is clear that, as the only\nshows guaranteed to be available\nworldwide on their service, this\ngrowing library of originals will be\nvital to their success going forward.\nIt is therefore likely no coincidence\nthat the proxy blocking came in so\nclose to the release of season four of\nHouse of Cards and season two of\nDaredevil.\nWhile the range of content in\nthe UK catalogue is by no means\nlacking, there are some glaring\nomissions when comparing to\nthe American catalogue. Notably\namong them, Friends, which arrived\nlast year in its entirety with great\nfanfare. There is also a huge deficit\nand lack of consistency in available\nfilms with confusing and frustrating\nchoices like Kill Bill Volume 2 being\navailable but Volume 1 not. Despite\nall this, it is my opinion that Netflix\nstill offers enough to justify the\n\u00a35.99 a month subscription and\nthose savvy enough are likely to\nstill be able to find a proxy that will\nallow them to watch anything they\nlike.\nfriendly content with the sitcom\nFuller House. Alongside this, their\nreturning shows like House of Cards\nand Orange is the New Black remain\nhuge pop culture phenomena.\nTheir documentary series Making a\nMurderer spawned the biggest crop\nof armchair detectives since the OJ\nSimpson trial and they\u2019ve managed\nIt could be\nthat we are\nreaching\nthe end of a\ngolden age\non television\nstreaming\nThis growing\nlibrary of\noriginals will\nbe vital to\ntheir success\nWell S@%$!

Photo Credit: The CW\nThis is one of\nthe greatest\nportrayals of\neveryone\u2019s\nfavorite wall-crawling\nsuperhero\nEach villain\ntests SpiderMan in\ndifferent\nways,\nmaking for\nunique and\nvaried action\nscenes\nA\niring for only two\nseasons, The Spectacular\nSpider-Man animated\nseries is one of the\nnumerous shows cancelled before its\ntime. With characterisation true to\nthe spirit of the comics, intelligent\nstorytelling, and superb action, this\nis one of the greatest portrayals of\neveryone\u2019s favorite wall-crawling\nsuperhero and the strongest in any\nmedium outside of comic books.\nThis is the type of series that proves\nboth the strength of the character\nof Spider-Man and the unique\nstrengths of animated series in the\nrealm of superheroes.\nCreated by Greg Weisman and\nVictor Cook, this is a series that\nnails what\u2019s special about SpiderMan and his world. As a whole,\nThe Spectacular Spider-Man\ndraws its influences from the early\ncomics. This was when the hero\nwas introduced and focused heavily\non his time as a student balancing\nrelationships, school life, and being\na hero. Voiced here by Josh Keaton,\nPeter really feels like the character\nhas jumped straight from the\ncomics and is swinging across your\nscreen in animated form. He has all\nof his strengths, weaknesses, charm,\nand depth, which makes him an\nendearing character to all viewers.\nThe lasting appeal of SpiderMan is based upon the character\u2019s\nrelatability and inspirational\nqualities. Peter Parker has ups and\ndowns in his personal, professional,\nand superhero lives, with many\nof his struggles based in the same\nissues that affect his viewers or\nreaders. At the same time, he\u2019s still\na good person, trying desperately to\nlive up to the ideals set by his late\nuncle.\nAll of those elements are alive and\nwell here in The Spectacular SpiderMan.The team behind the show not\nonlycraftscompellingstoriesinboth\nthe superhero and personal sides of\nPeter\u2019s life, but also combines them\nto make a cohesive narrative that\nexcites and even frustrates in the\nbest ways.As a result,this makes the\nseries engaging and entertaining,\nwith nothing ever feeling dull or\nsuperfluous. Everything is very well\nbalanced, which allows for a far\nmore thorough exploration of the\ncharacter and his supporting cast.\nDespite dealing with his early\ndays, the show wastes no time in\ntelling an origin story everyone\nknows. Instead, the series leaps into\naction with Peter already patrolling\nNew York as the Wall-Crawler and\nthen introduces his villains one by\none. All the characters, from villains\nlike Doctor Octopus, to supporting\ncharacters like Mary-Jane Watson\nare given time to shine and for us\nto learn what makes them tick.\nDespite the large supporting cast,\neach character is used in some shape\nor form in a way that\u2019s relevant to\nthe story.\nWhiletheepisodesareforthemost\npart stand-alone, they are structured\ninto small story arcs which all make\nup a larger season-long narrative.\nThe sense of continuity is used well\nand in a way that\u2019s fun and rewarding\nwhen watching from beginning to\nend. There\u2019s enough tweaks to the\nstandard tropes to keep the audience\nsurprised as well. The plotline often\nmoves in a completely different\ndirection, keeping you on your toes\nand not making any \u2018jump the shark\u2019\nmoments. All of this is done in a\nway that\u2019s consistently fresh and\nfilled with energy, sincerity, and a\nsense of fun.\nUsing a simplistic art style for the\nseries, The Spectacular Spider-Man\nhas a more youthful feel to it that\nmay take a while to get used to.\nHowever, this helps to differentiate\nthe series and highlights the\nheightened and comic book-inspired nature of the show.The use\nof bright colors and more cartoonish\nfeatures for characters helps images\nto pop off the screen in a dynamic\nand exciting manner. In addition,\ntons of awesome fights fill the series,\nwith Spidey\u2019s iconic wit, speed, and\nstrength on display during his many\nbattles. Each villain tests SpiderMan in different ways, making for\nunique and varied action scenes.\nAs the show goes on, it plays with\nits formula more and more. An\nexample is an episode juxtaposed\nwith Shakespearean recitals whose\ncontent reflected the main story\nof Venom\u2019s return. These breaks\nfrom standard formulas always\nworked spectacularly and helped\ndistinguish it from the several\nstraightforward superhero series\nbefore and after it. It has the type of\nsmart storytelling and commitment\nto a style that puts it on par with\nthe likes of the best superhero\nseries like Batman TAS. It\u2019s a damn\nshame the series got cancelled when\nit did, but the frustration is well\nworth the 26 episodes we got. The\nSpectacular Spider-Man is simply\nthe quintessential show for any fans\n(or potential ones) of the character.\nThe Spectacular Spider-Man is\navailable on Amazon Prime\nInterested in writing for TV?\nEmail us at tv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Of course, science\nmust be publicly accessible and\nable to be duplicated. And with\nincreased metrics and funding in the\nsciences dependent on performance\nmeasured by frequency and\nrecognition of publications, there\nare few alternatives for modern\nscientists to succeed \u2013 it\u2019s publish or\nperish.\nBut once we begin publishing\nacademically it\u2019s easy to find\nthis revered process riddled with\npotholes. From the get-go, scientists\nalter their manuscripts to the scope\nof the journal they intend to publish\nin. An editorial board determines if\nit fits within that journal\u2019s scope and\nmandate \u2013 if not, the manuscript\nis sent back and it\u2019s re-worked for\nanother journal, often losing some\nof the research integrity in this\nconstant reshaping process.\nOnce accepted, it\u2019s sent out to\nother scientists for review. But who\nare they? Larger publishing houses\nhave a list of known amenable\nreviewers, or sometimes the author\nwill send in a list; both pathways\nwhich can be biased, and none of\nwhich can force participation from\nthe whole community. Even with\na double-blind process, given the\nincreasing specialisation of fields,\nreviewers may already know whose\nresearch it is. Nothing prevents the\ndelivery of a coloured review based\non reviewer-author relationship\nfor good or bad, and regardless of\nresearch quality.

The\ndisastrous outcomes of this were\nseen in Japan\u2019s Riken Center scandal\nin 2014.\nAt all steps in the process, there is\npotential for human error, oversight,\nbias, competition, and nepotism.\nIt\u2019s time for the science community\nto peer-review the peer-review\npublication system and figure out\na more cohesive and reliable way\nforward.\nNAOMI STEWART\nS\nome of us go pretty far when\nit comes to maintaining\nvigilance with our diets.\nWe pinch our noses as we\ndown that tablespoon of cod liver\noil, chuck mounds of spinach into\nTesco\u2019s spinach ricotta tortellini,\nbecause obviously just the latter\nperfectly seared rib-eye steak is your\nquota nicely filled for the day.

You guessed it.\nIt is a scientific study to see whether\nthere is a correlation between the\nuse of social lubricants like smoking\nweed or drinking booze, and\u2026\nactual lubricants, i.e. having lots\nand lots of sex. The research polled\n284 undergraduate students of the\nUniversity of Oregon daily for 24\nconsecutive days. Results show,\nwhile most intercourse events were\nreported by people in committed\nrelationships (unfortunate\ncircumstances where marijuana\nand alcohol didn\u2019t influence the\nfrequency of intercourse),singles are\nmore likely to have sex after a night\nof binge drinking or marijuana-consumption. Captain Obvious... I\nmean, Dr. Kerr, lead researcher from\nthe University of Oregon, stated\nthat \u201cpeople may judge risks, such\nas whether they will regret having\nsex or whether they should use a\ncondom, differently when they are\ndrunk.\u201d\nNow, I can hear you say it from\nhere: \u2018Well, duh!\u2019 But this is a\nmatter of public health.

If you come near me, I will cut you. Photo Credit: Beatrice Murch\nThat\nperfectly\nseared\nrib-eye\nsteak is\nyour quota\nfilled for the\nday\nunderrated vitamin which many of\nus fail to get enough of, especially\nsince one of the main causes of\ndeficiency is excessive alcohol\nconsumption; one reason why you\nmay want to cut down on Ministry\nTuesdays, or those off-the-wall\nevents you keep getting invited to\nby that same blonde on Facebook.\nNiacin is essential for the energy\ngeneration process, particularly the\nglucose-to-ATP pathway. Naturally,\ndeficiency symptoms include low\nappetite, depression and lowered\nHDL (good cholesterol) levels. The\nbest sources of Niacin are fish, fish,\nand more fish. Particularly tuna, so\nI do apologise if you have a thing\nagainst the flaky stuff. Sometimes\nhealth is sacrifice.\nJust one more, I promise. I\nsaved what I believe is the most\nimportant for last. It may or may\nnot be common knowledge that the\nprimary source of vitamin B12 is\nanimals, including animal-derived\nfoods like dairy and eggs, but less\nconventional wisdom dictates that\na myriad gastrointestinal disorders,\neven low-scale types like diarrhoea,\naffect our ability to absorb the\nvitamin in our gut. Doctors rarely\ncheck B12 levels, and we almost\nalways assume we get enough, but\nmany of us really don\u2019t. We need\nB12 for the formation of red blood\ncells and proper nerve structure and\nfunction, so a deficiency here could\nmake it easier to contract dementia\nor Alzheimer\u2019s-like syndromes,\neven autism spectrum disorder in\nchildren. Other effects are memory\nproblems and consequent cognitive\ndecline. Clearly, the effects are\nmuch more harmful than most of\nus initially envisage. The stars of\nthe show here are salmon, sardines\nand liver, but the one downside here\nis that there are no purely vegan\nsources, so vegans, take note.\nFolks,that sliver of liver will do you\ngood.Physically and psychologically.\nCombined with an overall healthy\ndiet chock-full of leafy vegetables,\nsunflower seeds and fish, you\u2019ll be\nsure to attain more than enough\nvitamin B, and have a happier, more\nmeaningful life to boot.\nThe best\nsources of\nNiacin are\nfish, fish,\nand more\nfish\ndoesn\u2019t quite fulfil our magnesium\nrequirements, and knock back litres\nof vitamin water.

Most dystopian films\ncan be tough to stomach at the best\nof times \u2013 surely half the point of\ncinema is to escape into a world\nthat\u2019s not quite as screwed up as this\none is? \u2013 but there are those that\nadd enough humour to make it all\ngo down a bit more sweetly. While\nsome of these films, like Terry\nGilliam\u2019s 1985 masterpiece Brazil,\ngo down a slightly more lighthearted (but still ultimately soul-crushing) slapstick route, High-Rise\nachieves this through a much more\nClockwork Orange-based approach:\nacts of gasp-inducing depravity and\nviolence are played out in such a\nridiculous manner that they pile up,\neventually intertwining into a web\nof grisly hilarity.\nThe high-rise in question is a\nbrand new block of luxury flats,\ncomplete with supermarket,\nrecreational grounds, and an\napparently close-knit community\ninto which Dr Robert Laing \u2013\nplayed by the master of finding new\nways to be simultaneously slippery\nand charming, Tom Hiddleston \u2013\nhas just moved. The time and place\nis said to be London, 1975, but an\neerie sheen to the glaring pastel-bathed imagery makes the film feel\nlike it\u2019s set in some curiously robotic\nparallel world (although I\u2019m not all\nthat well versed in history \u2013 maybe\neverything just looked like that in\nthe seventies). All seems well at\nfirst: isolated from the trials and\ntribulations of everyday society,\nthe residents have built their own\nthriving network of livelihoods, and\nLaing settles into a pleasant routine,\nmanaging to make some friends\nacross the floors \u2013 even the architect,\nRoyal (an excellently steely Jeremy\nIrons), seems to have taken a liking\nto him. But it soon becomes clear\nthat all floors are not created equal:\nwater stops running, lights go out,\nTom Hiddleston as the slippery Dr Laing, luxuriating in his brutalist high-rise. Photo Credit: Allstar/High-Rise PR\nTom Stephens\nFilm Writer\nThe interest\nin HighRise comes\nin the way\nthe class-system\nclash plays\nout\nA marriage of reason and nightmare\nBen Wheatley aims high in his take on a towering icon of modern British fiction\nand those up above soon have to\nface the wrath of those down below.\nThe clash that ensues bears, on\npaper at least,many of the hallmarks\nof the class-system satire that you\u2019d\nexpect to follow such a setup \u2013 but\nwhere High-Rise\u2019s interest as a film\ncomes is the way in which the clash\nplays out. Violence quickly erupts,\nnaturally, at a party held by the\nlower floors when an intrusion is\nmade by a henchman of the uppers,\nbut immediately after this the moral\nconduct of both parties decays\nexponentially; a short montage of\nincreasingly disgruntled neighbours\nsuddenly debilitates into people\nscreaming and running past fires\nin a corridor halfway through\nthe film, and we\u2019re suddenly in a\ndocumentary about tribal warfare\n\u2013 one curiously under-stocked with\nactual wilderness and over-stocked\nwith jewellery, suits, and ties.\nThe descent is a fast and jarring\none; I wonder perhaps too fast,\nbut then again that may have\nbeen director Ben Wheatley\u2019s\nintended effect \u2013 I imagine societal\nspirals into madness have a way of\nsneaking up on you, as many things\nseem to in this busy world. One of\nthe strongest and funniest aspects\nof the film is that it manages to\nmaintain its sense of \u2018Britishness\u2019\ncome rain or shine, even at its most\njaw-dropping. A frontrunner for\nthe movie\u2019s best scene depicts Laing\nin an extended, brutal wrestling\nmatch with a fellow supermarket\npatron over the last tin of royal blue\non the shelf, which ends with him\nhurriedly rising, dusting himself off,\nand in an exasperated, apologetic\ntone explaining to his victim: \u201cIt\u2019s\nmy paint\u201d.\nI find it very easy a lot of the\ntime to take the piss out of\nTom Hiddleston for the overly-captivating villainous/anti-heroic\nBrit niche he\u2019s carved for himself in\nthe film industry, but to his massive\ncredit, I have never seen him fail\nto rise to the occasion with a good\nperformance. High-Rise is certainly\nno exception \u2013 he has a magnetism\nto him that sucks you in right from\nthe off, and as the chaos unfolds\naround him, the nuance he brings\nto the character of Dr. Laing makes\nyou wonder if he\u2019s the victim of his\ncircumstance or if he was in fact as\nmad as the other residents all along,\njust waiting for the opportunity\nto spread his wings. He meets his\nmatch in the form of Luke Evans\n\u2013 one of the most underrated screen\npresences working in mainstream\ncinema today \u2013 as Richard Wilder,\nthe hot-headed filmmaker turned\nrevolutionary who spearheads the\nrioting of the lower floors. Sienna\nMiller also turns in a strong\nperformance as the sultry,apparently\nall-knowing Charlotte Melville.\nThe film may not quite meet\nthe high standard set by its source\nmaterial (the J.G. Ballard novel\nof the same name), but HighRise offers a riotously anarchic,\nkaleidoscopic look at the depths of\ndepravity human society can sink\ninto if unchecked. Wheatley doesn\u2019t\nset himself an easy task, attempting\nto replicate a novel with one of\nliterature\u2019s greatest lesser-known\nopening lines: the film can\u2019t quite\nbeat that double-take feeling when\nyou first read,\u201cLater, as he sat on his\nbalcony eating the dog\u2026\u201d\nThe top three\nMurder\nMysteries\nthat aren\u2019t\nRear Window\nO\nk, so the original plan\nfor this week was to put\ntogether an election-themed section. Maybe\n\u2018best films featuring presidents\u2019 or\n\u2018best political dramas\u2019? The truth\nof it is that I\u2019m a bit election\u2019d out\nright now\u2026Either that or I couldn\u2019t\nfind anything on Google other than\nLincoln. You know what\u2019s more\nexciting than student elections\nthough? Murder. Hitchcock\u2019s Rear\nWindow may be the best but it\u2019s not\nthe be-all-and-end-all:\nMemento (2000)\nChristopher Nolan\u2019s breakout\nfeature Memento still stands up\ntoday as one of the most intelligent\nand intricate films ever. It focuses\non Leonard Shelby, a man who is\nhunting for his wife\u2019s murderer.\nWhat\u2019s unique is that Leonard can\nonly form short term memories.\nBecause of this, Memento is told\nbackwards, with X minutes of his\nlife being told followed by a skip\nback in time. Makes sense? No? I\nswear it\u2019s not as hard as it sounds.\nSe7en (1995)\nSeven (or \u2018Se7en\u2019 as it sometimes\nweirdly stylised) is easily one of the\nmost critically acclaimed films in\nthe genre. A modern-day classic,\nSeven tells the story of the hunt for\na serial killer who uses the seven\ndeadly sins as his modus operandi.\nThere are endless twists and turns\nas well as stellar performances by\nMorgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and, in\nparticular, Kevin Spacey.\nWho Framed Roger\nRabbit? (1988)\nDon\u2019t even challenge me on\nthis. Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\nis a flawless, loving spoof of the\nnoir genre. Bob Haskins is a\nperfect leading man and had the\nincredibly hard job of interacting\nwith characters who weren\u2019t actually\nthere. This is something which also\nmade the film quite revolutionary.\nAlso, was I the only person scarred\nby \u2018the Toon\u2019 as a kid? I doubt I\ncould sit through the ending even\nnow.\nBEN COLLIER\nHigh-Rise\nDir: Ben Wheatley. Script: Amy\nJump.

Script: David Farr.\nStarring: Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy, David\nMorrissey, Laura Birn, Stephen\nCampbell Moore. 87 minutes.\nT\nhe concept of the witch\nis an ancient one. Present\nsince time immemorial,\nexamples of witchcraft\ncan be found all across the globe,\nfrom the Maori people\u2019s belief in\nmakutu, to the kitsune-tsukai of\nJapan. Even today, witches play a\nprominentroleinsociety:justlookat\nthe phrase \u2018Ditch the Witch\u2019, used a\nfew years ago by supporters of Tony\nAbbott against the then-incumbent\nAustralian PM Julia Gillard. The\nwitch has come to stand for a fear\nof female agency and power, and\nnowhere is this more apparent than\nin Robert Eggers\u2019 directorial debut,\nThe Witch, a slow-burning horror\nthat creeps into your subconscious\nlike tendrils of mist.\nWe begin with the\nexcommunication of a family in\nNew England, half a century before\nthe infamous Salem witch trials.\nLeaving the commonwealth, they\nmust strike out on their own in an\ninhospitable state of nature, finding\na plot adjacent to a thick forest\nupon which they can found a new\nsociety. Things only go downhill\nfrom here. The eldest daughter of\nthe clan, Thomasin (Anya TaylorJoy), is watching her baby brother\nSamuel, when he vanishes before\nher very eyes. As time goes on,\ndespite her mother Katherine\u2019s\n(Kate Dickie) repeated cries to God,\nthe crops begin to fail, their goats\nstart expressing blood instead of\nmilk, and eldest son Caleb is cursed.\nFaced with this brutal barrage of\ncalculated misfortune from the\noutside the family turns inwards,\non Thomasin, whose burgeoning\nsensuality represents a threat to the\nsecurity of the community.\nBuilding on years of painstaking\nresearch, The Witch is nothing if not\nauthentic. With moon and candlelight often being the only source\nof illumination, the entire film is\ndrenched in an oppressive darkness,\nhighlighting the dichotomous\nbeauty and power of the natural\nworld. Most of the dialogue, we\nare told, is lifted verbatim from\nrecordings of the era.This,combined\nwith the excellent Yorkshire accents\nfrom the cast,call to mind the power\nof Clio Barnard\u2019s debut feature, The\nArbor, which shares the haunting\nsense of the dead being brought\nback to life. The cast are excellent\nthroughout: Taylor-Joy provides\nthe right notes of vulnerability, as\nshe treads the tightrope from girl\nto woman; and Ralph Ineson is\nferocious as patriarch William, his\ndeep voice making it sound like he\u2019s\nbeing chewing gravel. But top prize\ngoes to Dickie, her Katherine is a\nwoman struggling with the weight\nof the world, but refuses to break, all\nsinew and tension and deep grief.\nCompletely unreliant on jump-scares, Eggers\u2019 film is a cut above\nother horrors, and its impression\nlingers long after the credits roll.\nWhile the introduction of an actual\nwitch early on in the film may be\nseen by some as putting the horse\nbefore the cart, Eggers\u2019 decision\nactually works in his favour. It\nIn London, it\u2019s rare to properly\nknow your neighbours. And with\nthe release of The Ones Below, it\nseems one has even less of a reason\nto pop round for tea and biscuits.\nKate (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy) and Jon\n(David Morrissey) are a settled\ncouple, expectant with their first\nchild, living in a spacious apartment\nin a London terrace. Their\ndownstairs flat, following the death\nof its owner, is taken over by Justin\n(Stephen Campbell Moore) and\nTeresa (Laura Birn),another couple,\nwho are also expecting. Kate and\nJon invite the other couple over for\ndinner,but as the evening progresses,\ntensions build in the apartment,\nculminating in a tragic incident that\nkick-starts a wave of psychological\ntorture for Kate. What follows is a\nchilling game of cat-and-mouse,\none that reveals the mental isolation\nthat can be faced by a new mother,\nand critiques a system that treats\nwomen as hysterical.\nAnd yet perhaps this film is better\nread as an exploration of class\ndifferences, and how the economic\ncan spill over into the personal.\nKate and Jon are icons of millennial\nmodernity, their flat all artfully\nstripped down wooden flooring. In\ncontrast, the flat below is all shiny\nsurfaces and primary colours. At\ntimes, this spills over into heavy-handedness, such as when Kate\nlooks out of the window of her\ndull flat to see Teresa lounging in\nthe sun-dappled, John Watersesque garden, like a plasticky extra\nin a pop video. But director David\nFarr throws in subtler hints along\nthe way: Kate works at the V&A,\nwhile Justin\u2019s investments mean\nTeresa never needs to work again;\nthe age-difference between the\ndownstairs couple creates a palpable\nnote of suspicion with Kate and\nJon; and Teresa\u2019s gift of a gender-colour-coordinated sailor\u2019s outfit\nfor the baby clashes with Kate\u2019s\npenchant for muted tones. In\nshort, the tension between the two\ncouples may be a result, not of any\npsychological disturbance, but from\nthe tensions of the class system.\nAt least, that\u2019s my take on it,\nand lord knows this film needs it,\notherwise it\u2019s nothing more than an\nadequate re-tread of innumerable\nparanoia-dramas, namely Polanski\u2019s\nRosemary\u2019s Baby. There are tropes in\nThe Ones Below that have become\ndeeply ingrained in the thriller\ngenre \u2013 you can see them coming\na mile off \u2013 and it would have\nbeen much more effective if the\nfilm avoided them full-stop. We\nend with a conclusion that leaves\nno doubt about what happened\nin the viewer\u2019s mind, erasing any\nsemblance of ambiguity created in\nthe preceding 80 minutes. Those\nlooking for a fresh take on the\ntopic of female hysteria should\nlook elsewhere. The Ones Below is\na competently directed take on a\nwell-trodden topic; a Polanski for\nthe hipster generation.\nFRED FYLES\nallows us to focus on the real enemy:\nman himself, and the psychological\nparanoia that comes when faced\nwith the barbarity of the natural\nworld. Having made a break with\nnature man can never truly return to\nit, creating a delicious tension at the\nheart of The Witch. The real witches,\nit begins to dawn, were inside of us\nall along.\nFRED FYLES\nThe Ones\nBelow is\nPolanskilite for\nmillenials\nAnya Tayor-Joy as Thomasin, in the excellently eerie debut from David Eggers, The Witch.

In anticipation\nof the decades of dust, we stole\nabandoned TEDxAlbertopolis\nt-shirts, barricaded the door, and\ncrept down the stairs.\nAfter crawling a few feet, it was\npitch black; an absolute disorienting\ndarkness where you couldn\u2019t see\nyour hand in front of your face. We\ndecided not to press any further\nafter we discovered that the tunnel\nwas partially collapsed, given that\nno one knew our location beyond\nthe Snapchats we left as clues.\nThe ceiling was low, the floor was\nrough. Heads were banged, and\nknees were scraped. The confined\nspace and total darkness heightened\nall senses, making it one of the\nmost uncomfortable, intense sexual\nencounters I\u2019ve experienced.\nDust-ruined stolen t-shirts\nabandoned in the tunnel (where they\nwill for evermore lay), we emerged\nblinking into the brightness of Beit\nQuad, our lungs thirsty for air that\nhad not been undisturbed for years.\nWe were tracked down in the bar,\nhalf covered in dust, by disbelieving\nfriends who had followed our\ndisappearing photographic\nbreadcrumbs.\nWas it worth it?

You taught\nme to strive to make other people\nsee how brightly I shine.\nWhat you didn\u2019t teach me was\nhow to not take crap from guys\nlike you again. You crept into my\nlife, condemning the abuses of my\npast, whilst carelessly treating me\nthe same. You helped me to be open\nand honest about each and every\nemotion, without ever reflecting for\na moment on yours. I basked in your\nprivilege and boldness, empowered\nby your strength and directness. But\nunder the veneer of truthfulness,you\nwithdrew into lies, changing from\na man I thought was beautiful, to\nsomeone so capable of such cruelty.\nYou taught me that relationships\naren\u2019t easy; I\u2019ve never worked as hard\nas I did when I tried to understand\nyou. But after all of that, when it\ncame to it, you didn\u2019t want to put in\nthe work.You showed me that those\nwho seem giving can be selfish,\nthose who seem well-mannered\ncan be disrespectful, and those who\nseem the warmest can be the most\ncold.\nYou poured your early impression\nof my personality into a cast\nprojected from your dysfunctional\nrelationships, and your insecurities\nmade you ashamed of the false\nimpression that came out of the\nmould. You taught me to convince\nmyself that I was at fault, to swallow\nmy tears and pretend you didn\u2019t\nhurt me. With you, I put up with\nmore than I ever thought possible.\nI learnt to adjust my expectations,\nand to augment my aspirations and\ndreams.

Photo Credit: redfairyproject.com\nT\nhis year I ran for DPCS\nin the Union Elections,\nand here's the story of\nmy campaign.\nFirst of all, I\u2019d like to thank\neveryone who took the time to vote\nfor me and spread the word around.\nI really do appreciate it, and despite\nlosing by quite a bit in the end,\nlooking back, I\u2019m really happy that\nwe managed to get as far as we did.\nWhy? Because before these\nelections, I was a lurker. I\u2019d gotten\ninvolved in a few societies, but I was\nessentially a nobody in the wider\nworld of Imperial. If you heard my\nname or saw my face, it probably\nwouldn\u2019t mean anything to you\nunless you took a class or played\nhockey with me.\nSo why did I run? In a chance\nencounter one evening, at a Guitar\nSoc Open Mic Night,the wonderful\nChris Kaye bought us a round of\ndrinks.This was such a lovely gesture\nthat I went over to thank him, and\nended up showing him a few magic\ntricks. Long story short, he\u2019d drunk\nenough at that point to think that I\nwould have made a good sabb.\nI was sceptical because of my lack\nof experience, but interested, so I\ntalked to Ben, the current DPCS.\nHe told me that no matter how\nmuch experience you think you\nhave, you\u2019re never ready for the\nactual job.\nSo with the knowledge that\nanyone who got the job would\nstruggle no matter how much more\nthey\u2019d been involved, I decided that\nI\u2019d give the campaign a go.\nI\u2019ll be honest, and admit that\nhalf of my motive at this point was\nto use the campaign to get some\npublicity for Magic Society, and the\nother half was that I didn\u2019t feel like\ngetting a real job at the end of the\nyear.\nWe prepared our campaign, and\nI think we did a pretty good job. I\nfinally used up some of the printer\ncredits that the College has been\nchucking at us for four years, and\npasted my face all around campus in\nthe hope that people might possibly\nnotice.\nWhen the polls opened, however,\nsomething strange happened. As\nI walked around, brandishing a\ngiant picture of myself on the end\nof a hockey stick, giving sweets to\nstrangers and performing magic\ntricks in an attempt to get them to\nlisten to my pitch, I started hearing\nreal stories from the students\nwho ran into problems running\ntheir clubs. Be it room bookings\nor budgets, it was clear that the\nworld of clubs and socs at Imperial\nhad fixable issues, and I started to\nactually want the job. I realised that\nit\u2019s a position where you can make a\ndifference to a lot of people,and that\nit would be a great opportunity to\nmeet and help out some genuinely\ncool people.\nSo I campaigned a lot harder than\nI thought I would. I fought through\nthe many straight rejections from\nstudents that were completely\nuninterested, talked to a tonne of\npeople, and honestly enjoyed the\nexperience of seeing what people\nthought of the uni we all study at.\nMeeting the other candidates was\njust great too: I realised that it was\na mistake to lurk like I did for three\nyears when there are so many cool\npeople to meet if you just look a\nlittle harder.\nI went into the results party,\nwanting the role for completely\ndifferent reasons from before I\nstarted campaigning, and genuinely\nhoping to win despite the odds.\nIn the end, I lost by quite a large\nmargin, and at the time I was pretty\nsurprised and disappointed.\nI was quite angry too, as the other\ncandidates didn\u2019t show up to the\nresults party.How did I lose to a guy\nwho doesn\u2019t even care enough to see\nthe results with his competitors?\nLooking back,I was never going to\nwin. There\u2019s no way that two weeks\nalone can get you from pretty much\nunknown to the winner of what is\nessentially a popularity contest, and\nI\u2019m glad I got out of my little bubble\nto meet some great people I would\nnever have had any contact with\notherwise.\nIf there\u2019s a moral of the story, it\u2019s\nthat if you\u2019re a natural lurker like\nme, you should try to get involved\neven if it\u2019s outside your comfort\nzone. This applies especially if you\nhave any inkling towards running\nfor a position in the future, because\nin reality a campaign starts years\nbefore the elections begin,when you\nmeet people and start building your\ninfluence.\nI hope I don\u2019t sound too bitter\nI realised\nthat it was\na mistake\nto lurk like I\ndid for three\nyears\nTry to get\ninvolved\neven if it\u2019s\noutside your\ncomfort\nzone\nabout my loss. I truly wish James,\nnext year\u2019s DPCS, the best of luck.\nFrom the look of things, it\u2019s a\nposition that feels like you\u2019re on a\ntreadmill that always moves twice\nas fast as you can run. With over\n300 clubs at Imperial, it likely feels\nmore like a vertical climb than an\nuphill battle, but I still would\u2019ve\nloved to have given it a go. I\u2019ll buy\nyou a much deserved pint when I\nswing back around the Union! And\nplease be nice to my Magic Society?\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the same at Imperial\nwithout the small niche societies, so\nI hope you give them the attention\nthey need too.\nBefore\nthese\nelections, I\nwas a lurker\n\n"

Photo Credit: Cale Tilford\nB\nefore Grimes bursts\nonto stage at the Brixton\nAcademy, there\u2019s a sense\nthat she\u2019s compensating\nfor something: we would usually\nexpect the venue to be playing the\nusual warm-up mix of inoffensive\nR&B and indie pop \u2013 the standard\nfare for off-piste artists like\nGrimes, who straddle populism\nand experimentalism \u2013 but tonight\nthey\u2019ve opted for a succession\nof classical string pieces. There\u2019s\nsomething deliberate about it.\nFollowingthereleaseofherbreakout\nthird LP, Visions, which catapulted\nher onto the world stage, Grimes\nwas subject to oppressive amounts\nof scrutiny, from professionals and\npublic alike; in a since-deleted\ntumblr post, she hit back: \u201cI\u2019m tired\nof men who aren\u2019t professional\nor even accomplished musicians\ncontinually offering to \u2018help me out\u2019\n(without being asked), as if I did\nthis by accident\u201d, she wrote, \u201cI\u2019m\ntired of being considered vapid for\nliking pop music.\u201d\nSo perhaps the strings are a means\nof Grimes asserting herself before\nshe\u2019s even glimpsed; it\u2019s a reflection\nof her magpie-esque approach\nto music, with a range of tastes\nencompassing both Mariah Carey\nand Stravinsky, without feeling\nthe need to posit them as polar\nopposites. The message Grimes\nseems to be sending out tonight is\nclear: she\u2019s done being patronised,\nit\u2019s time to break out into her own\nsonic sphere.\nAnd what a sphere it is: ebullient\nwith optimism, Grimes channelled\nher energy into her recent LP, Art\nAngels, an album that manages to\nbe dizzyingly complex and off-piste,\nbut still has killer hooks, perfect for\nscreaming along to. A majority of\nthe songs have been adapted for the\nlive performance, adding to their\nintensity: Art Angels highlight \u2018Flesh\nWithout Blood\u2019 ends with a drum\nmachine breakdown, going out with\na bang; \u2018Venus Fly\u2019, her duet with\nJanelle Mona\u00e9, is ratcheted up to\nthe nth degree,dragging contrasting\nBrixton are lapping it up.\nAtherlastLondongig,waybackin\n2012, my friend said that watching\nGrimes was like \u201cwatching an\ninfant play with Fisher-Price toys\u201d.\nUncharitable, perhaps, but there is\na modicum of truth in it: like all\nartists heavily reliant on computers\nand synthesisers, it is difficult for\nGrimes to do much more than\nsway in the centre of the stage,\nsurrounded by a myriad of flashing\nbuttons and knobs. But she\u2019s come a\nlong way since then, bringing along\ntwo ninja-like dancers, who twirl\nribbons and at one point switch to\npairs of sharp blades, accentuating\nthe music. In a nice touch, backing\nvocals are provided by the support\nact HANA, an American artist\nwhose music is well produced,\nbut a tad familiar, resembling a\nsmoothed over version of Purity\nRing, or a less upbeat Chvrches;\nlike Grimes, she uses a high register,\nand at points in the gig their voices\nbecome indistinguishable. Despite\nhaving to repeatedly leap back to\nher central command station of\nlaptops and keyboards, Grimes\nmanages to spend most of the gig\nprowling around the stage, jumping\nand caterwauling like an escaped\nhyena in an astonishing display of\nvigour.\nHowever, such action can only\nbe maintained for so long, and at\npoints the overwhelming energy of\nthe songs collapses into a general\ncacophony; this is not at all helped\nby the dodgy sound mixing, which\nelevates the bass above all other\nsounds in the room, resulting too\noften in a sludgy mess. Taiwanese\nrapper Aristophanes isn\u2019t available\nto perform her part on \u2018Scream\u2019, so\nGrimes takes over, offering to rap\nin Russian; unfortunately, what had\nbeen pinpointed Mandarin bars on\nthe album,spat out like poison darts,\nbecomes completely indecipherable\n\u2013 a clutter of shouting and wailing.\nSince Visions, made on a copy of\nApple\u2019s GargeBand, Grimes has\nrelentlessly expanded her musical\nvocabulary, teaching herself the\nguitar, ukulele, drums, and violin in\npreparation for Art Angels\u2019preciselyproduced tidal wave of sound. With\nthis vast armoury, she has begun the\nprocess of rearranging the songs\nalone in her bedroom, was reaching\nout across the sonic divide to each\nindividual listener. Reinterpreting\nthe songs for the Brixton audience,\nhowever, has robbed them of this\nmagical power.\nBut there are gems here too:\nGrimes has had the good sense to\nnot mess with the classics too much.\n\u2018Genesis\u2019 and \u2018Oblivion\u2019, the two\nmost popular tracks from Visions,\nhave been preserved pretty much\nintact, much to the delight of the\ncheering audience. In her scatter-brained, eclectically chatty manner,\nshe tells the audience that she\ndoesn\u2019t like the process of going off\nand back on for an encore, and will\njust play it straight away instead.\nIn her last song, \u2018Kill V Maim\u2019, the\nheady bass proves no match for\nthe electrified audience, chanting\naway with the evil-cheerleader\nstyle chorus, and the gig ends on a\ntriumphant note.\nThe concert at Brixton seems\nto mark Grimes out as being at\na junction: the gap between the\nimpressionistic subtleties of Visions,\nand the bombastic maximalism\nof Art Angels is a difficult one to\nstraddle. When things all come\ntogether, it\u2019s like she\u2019s riding a\nwave of dynamism, buoyed on by\nthe audience; but the dodgy sound\nmixing, and the insistence on\ncontorting old material to fit her\npresent sound does her no favours.\nBrixton was a statement of intent:\nGrimes has moved on from her old\nmaterial, and is ready to set off on a\nnew bombastic course. Who knows\nwhat the destination will be; but the\njourney will sure be interesting.\nClaire Boucher and her crew. Photo Credit: Cale Tilford\nThe\noverwhelming\nenergy of\nthe songs\ncollapses\ninto a general\ncacophony\nsections apart, and allowing the\nbuild-up to ricochet into a ground-shattering climax; and she opts\nfor the album version of \u2018Realiti\u2019\nover the previously released demo,\nfeaturing heavier basslines and\ndrums with more kick \u2013 fans may\nhave complained about the new\nversion online, but those ensconced\nby the warm bath of sound in\nShe\u2019s riding\na wave of\ndynamism,\nbuoyed on by\nthe audience\nfrom Visions, allowing them to fit in\nbetter with her new direction.But all\ntranslators are traitors,and by trying\nto fit the minimalist structures of her\nearlier songs around the framework\nof her newer stuff, she stretches the\nmaterial too thin. Songs like \u2018Be a\nBody\u2019and \u2018Symphonia IX (My Wait\nis U)\u2019 have been distorted beyond\nbelief, their bass-lines subsuming\nGrimes\u2019 vocals, which have dropped\nan octave or two.The magic of these\nsongs was their intimacy: Grimes,\n\n"

Gast\nPresident of Imperial College\nThere\u2019s no place better than Queen\u2019s Lawn on a sunny day. Photo Credit: Wikipedia\nS\nince arriving at Imperial,\nI have been extremely\nimpressed with our students\u2019\nexcellence. I\u2019ve seen brilliant\nscholars explaining their research,\ntalented entrepreneurs describing\ntheir spin-out company and gifted\nmusicians inspiring a rapt audience.\nI love to walk through College in\nthe evening and see the ballroom\ndance team practicing with the jazz\nband rehearsing next door.This is an\nincredible place thanks to the great\ntalent, energy and motivation of our\nstudents.\nExcellent\neducation\nis far more\nthan getting\na degree\ncertificate\nWe strive to\ncontinually\nenhance\nour\nteaching\nConsulting\nstudents\non the\ndecisions\nthat directly\naffect them\nis important\nImperial staff care deeply\nabout providing students with an\nexcellent education. Recently the\nCouncil, our governing body, met\nwith union sabbatical officers at\nan away-day. We discussed what\nwe want the future of Imperial to\nlook like, and how the \u201cproduct\u201d of\na university education was perhaps\nless important than the \u201cexperience\u201d\nof it. Learning is a process and one\ncan never achieve a state of having\nlearnt all there is to know.\nSo, what do we mean when we\ntalk about excellence in education? I\nthink we mean that the knowledge,\nexperiences and relationships\nstudents gain during their studies\nare affirming, and, in many ways,\nlife-changing. Excellent education\nis far more than getting a degree\ncertificate, and one\u2019s education\ndoes not stop with graduation. Our\naim is to ensure that the education\nImperial students receive prepares\nthem for excellence throughout\ntheir lives.\nWe know that we value a highly\nrigorous research-led curriculum\nthat enables students to engage\nactively with research in their\ndisciplines and across disciplinary\nboundaries. To be immersed in\none of the world\u2019s top research\nuniversities gaining knowledge and\nexperiences from the leaders in\ntheir fields is one of the hallmarks\nof Imperial\u2019s educational experience.\nWe also value opportunities for\nstudents to delve into the unknown,\nexperience the discovery of research,\nand be creative and entrepreneurial.\nWe have made providing these\nopportunities an important part of\nour college strategy.\nWe strive to continually enhance\nour teaching and we aspire to move\nto the forefront in developing new\nways of teaching and learning that\ncombine our use of technology\nand our time together to optimise\nthe knowledge, experience and\nrelationships gained.\nWe know that there are aspects of\nour student experience that are not\nexcellent and we need to improve.\nThe mental well-being of students\nis of paramount importance to\ntheir lives and success, and we are\nenhancing our portfolio of student\nsupport services. We are also\nfocused on providing timely and\nuseful assessment and feedback and\nexcellent research supervision and\nmentoring.\nIn my speech to the community\non March 17th\n, I was pleased to\nannounce some new grants for\nbuilding excellence in teaching and\nresearch to move the College to the\nforefront of 21st\ncentury education.\nOur new Vice Provost (Education)\nProfessor Simone Buitendijk will\noversee the awarding and evaluation\nof these grants.\nConsulting students on the\ndecisions that directly affect them\nis important. We do this primarily\nthrough the elected sabbatical\nofficers leading the student union.\nThey,andotherstudentleadersofthe\nhundreds of clubs and societies, set\nthe policies, tone and environment\nfor the student experience. One\nof their important projects is their\ncurrent work on a \u201cRespect for\nOthers\u201d guide for students. This\nwill be a code of behaviour and\nsocial expectations for students that\nbuilds upon the \u201cRespect for Others\nGuide\u201d that we produced last year\nfor staff. Like the staff guide, the\nstudent guide will include a Respect\nfor Others Pledge. And just as we\nexpect all staff members to know\nand live by the Pledge, so will we\nexpect students to do the same.\nWhy is this important? We have\na wonderful community of over\n22,000 people \u2013 it is a dynamic and\nvibrant environment where students\nwillspendsomeoftheirbestdaysand\nhave some of their most memorable\nexperiences. It is important to\nrecognise that there are times when\nwe fall far short of excellence and in\nfact create very negative experiences\nfor our peers and our community.\nWhile I love to talk to students and\ncelebrate their talent, creativity and\ndedication, I am deeply unhappy\nto read reports of some students\nundermining themselves and their\nteammates by drinking themselves\nsick and damaging property or\nothers being disrespectful to their\npeers and their community. None\nof us want our community to be\nharmed or individuals to be hurt by\nthe mistakes and thoughtlessness of\na few.\nImperial students excel at taking\non hard challenges and daunting\nprojects. Where else can you see\nstudent productions of Sweeney\nTodd and Petrushka in the same\nweek? I know that we can meet\nthe challenge of providing the\nbest environment and culture for\nstudents. We can work together\nto do better and I am optimistic\nthat affirming our values through\n\u201cRespect for Others\u201d will help us\nto avoid these mistakes and make\nthe Imperial student experience\nexcellent for all.\nProviding an excellent education\nfor our students is a top priority\nat Imperial. Doing so requires\nenduring commitment by all of us,\nstaff and students alike.I believe that\ntogether we can achieve excellence\nand we can show the world what an\nexcellent education looks like.\n\n"

Mmmm, that sweet\ntessellation.\nThis week you find it amazing\nthat so many candidates\napplied for a Presidential post\nthat receives a \u00a319,000 salary\n\u2013 although to be fair Alice\nGast gets paid over \u00a3400,000\nand she doesn't even have to\nput up with union council's\nshit.\nThis week you are\ndisappointed that Cale did\nnot win FELIX Editor,\nespecially since you invested\nso heavily in the green leafy\nvegetable industry. Also Lef\nhates the horoscopes so don\u2019t\ntrust him.\nThis week, you are running\nfor Union President and are\nasked to appear on a radio\nshow. However, you are too\nafraid of not living up to the\nentertainment value provided\nby this year's candidates and\nwithdraw an hour before\nyou're supposed to go on air.\nThis week after Marco\nRubio was forced to drop\nout of the US presidential\nrace, he decides to run for\nDeputy President (Finance\nand Services); however, he\nloses to RON and so decides\nto do a masters in Science\nCommunication.\nHOROSCOPES\nNEWS WITHOUTTHE NEWS\nCAREERISTS REALISE THEY HAVE ONE\nMORE YEAR TO GET REAL JOB\nWHEN YOU CAN SEE DISABILITY BENEFIT\nCUTS ONTHE HORIZON\n\n"

In\n2011/12,the 441 who did accounted\nfor 2.8% of students.\nThere are currently nine\ncounsellors working as part of\nthe Imperial counselling service,\nwhose work hours amount to 6.6\nfull-time equivalent (FTE) staff.\nThis is up from 5.4 FTE staff last\nyear. The counselling service had\nhad its budget frozen, so staffing\nhad remained at 5.4 for two years\nrunning.\nNotorious for its long waiting\ntimes, last year the counselling\nservice was given the budget to\nemploy two extra members of staff.\nThe service is free, confidential\nand for students only, although staff\nare welcome to speak to counsellors\nabout concerns over their students,\nand personal tutors often refer\nstudents to it.\nSo why the increase? Mental\nhealth charity,Mind,told ITV News\nit believed the hike was down to the\nrise in tuition fees. College officials\nare likely to see this as a of result\nbetter advertising of the counselling\nand heightened awareness of what\u2019s\nprovided, due to campaigns like\nMentality. However, the results of\nthis only came out last May, and\nare unlikely to have spurred such an\nincrease in demand. It also doesn\u2019t\nexplain the 15% jump in people\nseeking services from 2011 to 2012.\nLast year\u2019s Mentality Survey\nreport recommended that the\ncounselling service at Imperial\nneeded to improve provisions at\n\u201ckey times\u201d, including the exam\nperiod, although mentioned that\nwaiting times for the service had\nimproved since the year before.\ncontinued on page 3\n\u2022 5% increase in students over same period\n\u2022 Staff for counselling service still needed\nGrace Rahman\nEditor-in-Chief\n\n"

Photo Credit: SUPERHOT Team\nA stragetic and minimalist first-person shooter where time moves with you\nI\nmagine a game where you are\na super assassin, well-versed\nin the arts of weaponry and\nhand-to-hand combat. You\nmow down countless enemies,\nspraying them down with machine\nguns, splitting them in half with\na well placed katana swipe or just\nbeating them to a pulp, like the\ngood old days. \u201cWait, why is that\ndifferent from tons of other games\nthat are on the market?\u201d I hear you\ncry, dear reader, and I would not\ndisagree with you. This is where the\ntwist and specialty of SUPERHOT\ncomes in: time moves with you.\nBasically, when you don\u2019t move,\ntime stands still. However, if you\neven move a finger, the clock starts\nticking and all hell breaks loose.This\ncombination of kill all bad guys and\nthe unique time mechanic makes\nSUPERHOT a really special game.\nAt the end of a stressful Monday\n(horrible way to start the week I tell\nyou), I opened up Steam for some\nmuch needed respite.To my delight\nSUPERHOT, a game I had been\nanticipating for quite some time,\nhad just been dropped. At first I was\nput off by the relatively steep price\nof \u00a317.99 (especially for an indie\ngame), but in the end I decided to\nsplurge.\nI fired up the game, and started\nup the main story. I have to say\nguys and saving the princess?!).\nHowever, the mechanics of the\ngame were definitely the highlight\nof the experience. The level design,\ngunplay and AI were all really good\nand I had absolutely nothing to\ncomplain about. What about the\nkey feature, the game changer: the\ntime stopping mechanic? I have to\nadmit I was impressed. It was really\nsmooth, and at times I did feel like\nNeo in that super-famous scene\nwhen I was dodging bullets in slow\nmotion. Furthermore, the mechanic\nwasn\u2019t just some gimmick that you\ncould just ignore, because if you\ndon\u2019t play slowly and tactically, the\ngame is incredibly hard.If you try to\njust go Rambo-style on the baddies\nyou definitely won\u2019t make it longer\nthan about ten seconds.\nTalking about the baddies, and\nthe art style in general, it is all very\nminimalistic, which seems to be\nsome kind of theme in the gaming\nindustry right now.The bad guys are\nred blocky dudes and the levels are\ngrey and white blocky blocks that\nPunching polygons. Photo Credit: SUPERHOT Team\nhint at the things they are supposed\nto represent. To be honest this is\ncompletely fine, because sometimes\ntoo many details can distract you\nfrom the game, and in this case\nallows you to focus completely on\nthe gameplay. Furthermore, this\nallows this game to run superbly on\npretty much any machine (oh yeah,\nit also runs on Windows and Mac).\nSo I have listed a lot of good things\nat the challenges (which are redos\nof the main mission, with certain\nrestrictions/enhancements). While\nI have not completed everything,\nI have given it a good shot and I\ncurrently stand at five hours. I feel\nlike ten hours is the most time I am\ngoing to get out of this game, due\nto its somewhat repetitive nature,\nsince the mechanics stay the same,\nthe scenarios change marginally and\nthe settings all kind feel the same.\nIn a sense that makes a me a bit sad,\nsince this is such a good game. Oh\nwell.\nThere are a couple features, like\nthe uploading of your kill-streak\nvideos, that I haven\u2019t mentioned\nsince I didn\u2019t really consider them\nthat important, although they may\nappeal to a different type of gamer.\nThey all seemed a bit gimmicky to\nme, and I haven\u2019t really delved too\ndeeply into them.\nAll in all I would say this is\nan absolutely excellent game.\nSUPERHOT is a really new and\nmodern take on the tired old genre\nthat is first person shooters. The\ntime-stopping mechanic is unique\nand super fun to play. However, like\na nice piecce of bacon,it tastes really\ngood but there ain\u2019t a lot of meat to\nit. Given that it is quite expensive, I\nwould probably hold off on buying\nit right now and wait for a Steam\nsale, where you will definitely get\nthe right amount of bang for your\nbuck.\nSUPERHOT is out now on Steam\nAt times\nI felt like\nNeo in\nthat super\nfamous\nscene\nThe time-stopping\nmechanic is\nunique and\nsuper fun\nto play\nI was immediately hooked. The\nstory itself was kind of meh. It\nwas one of those super indie ones\nthat make you question your\nown existence and wonder if you\nhave stumbled by chance onto an\ninteractive experience written by\nNietzsche. To be honest this is not\nreally a negative and really just a\nsign of my fatigue with the indie\nscene in general (I mean what is\nwrong with just killing the bad\nabout this game so far, however I do\nhave one big complaint: the amount\nof content in the game versus the\nprice. I finished the main mission\n(and trust me I wasn\u2019t very good\nand had to do multiple restarts) in\none sitting of about 3 hours. Then\nI took some time to have a crack\nat the endless mode which are just\nendless battles in various settings\n(quite fun and the maps are nice,but\npretty repetitive), and then finally\n\n"

Senna was the\nfirst majorly successful documentary\nfilm produced by the quintessential\nBritish studio Working Title, best\nknown for rom coms such as Love\nActually and Notting Hill. Looking\ninto it, it\u2019s clear that the film was\nmade as a passion project courtesy\nof Woking Title founder, producer,\nand massive F1 buff Tim Bevan.\nThis passion is contagious.The story\ntold here is that of Ayrton Senna,\nthe three-time Formula One world\nchampion who died tragically in a\ncrash at the young age of 34. This\ntragically premature death, televised\nto 300 million people, deeply shook\nthe world of F1. The main things\nexplored include a cataloguing\nof Senna\u2019s rise to success, the\nimportance of his icon-status in his\nnative Brazil, and his rivalry with\nformer partner Alain Prost.\nIt\u2019s hard to describe what makes\nthis film work so well. The repeated\nuse of home and amateur footage\nperhaps goes some way to helping\nthough, a feature carried over by\ndirector Asif Kapadia in his recent\nOscar-winner Amy. The use of\nsuch footage gives a more intimate\nexperience, allowing the viewer\nto form closer connections to the\npeople documented, and become\ninvested in their story.The avoidance\nof \u2018talking head\u2019 interviews is also\nsomething which I feel adds to\nits uniqueness. But ultimately it\u2019s\nthe editing, stellar soundtrack, and\nflawless pacing which make Senna\nsuch an incredible film to watch.\nThe rivalry that Senna had with\nformer teammate Prost is also\nbrilliantly complex. The two men\nare very well portrayed, and one\nreally gets to know their individual\ncharacters and motivations \u2013\nKapadia was extremely lucky to\nhave such an engrossing story\non which to base his biography.\nOne of the weaker points of the\ndocumentary, however, comes from\nthe exploration of some of the\nsport\u2019s politics. This is not to say\nthat these sections are poorly done,\nit\u2019s just that,as someone who is not a\nfan of the sport,these sections didn\u2019t\nfascinate me as much. Nevertheless,\nSenna is a masterclass on how to put\ntogether an engrossing, emotive and\ninformative biopic. I might even\nwatch the new F1 season now, who\nknows.\nAryton Senna relaxes after a race.. Photo Credit: Senna PR\nAnomalisa\nDir: Charlie Kaufman, Duke\nJohnson. Script: Charlie Kaufman.\nStarring: David Thewlis, Jennifer\nJason Leigh, Tom Noonan. 90\nminutes.\nA\nnomalisa begins with a\nsingle voice. Or maybe\nsingle voices. Multiple\ncopies of Tom Noonan\u2019s\nvoice pile up over a blank screen,\ncreating a wall of unintelligible\nsound. It\u2019s a panoply of voices. A\ncacophony of voices. An oppression\nof voices.\nThis is what life is like for Michael\nStone (David Thewlis), a customer\nservice guru in Cincinnati for a\nconvention, whose inescapable\nennui has rendered everyone around\nhim \u2013 his wife, his child, his ex-girlfriend \u2013 indistinguishable,\nspeaking in the same bland voice,\nand wearing the same mask-like\nface. We follow Michael as he\nlooks up an old flame, tries to\nbuy a toy for his son, and has a\npotentially life-changing encounter\nwith Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh),\nthe only person in this nightmare\nwith a unique voice. Anomalisa\nconducts itself through a detailed\nexamination of the wonderful\nminutiae of the everyday; these\nexperiences \u2013 ordering room service,\nwalking along dark streets \u2013 are the\nones that truly form us, influencing\nthe direction of our lives.\nDirectors Charlie Kaufman\nand Duke Johnson opted for an\nunorthodox animation method,\nmaking use of stop-motion\ntechniques with 3D-printed\nmodels. The result is a sense of\nunease that initially leaves you in\nthe lurch; characters\u2019 faces have\nsplits along the middle, giving\neveryone the sense they are wearing\nwire-frame glasses, and their skin\ngives an impression of softness, like\nthe downy surface of a peach. Much\nof the focus of 3D printing has been\non its possible impacts on weapons\nmanufacture, or heavy industry, but\nwhat about how it can print off an\nexpression of longing? Or capture\nthe nuances of a forced grin?\nThis style, along with the\nomnipresence of Noonan\u2019s voice,\nsits like a heavy weight, making for\nuneasy watching at first. However,\nas the story progresses we no longer\nnotice it, engrossed in the unfolding\ntale of tenderness playing out in\nfront of us. And then it\u2019s brought\nto our attention again, and suddenly\nthe whole set-up makes sense. It\u2019s a\nmagical moment, one that expands\nthe powers of cinema. To speak\nmore of it would be to lessen its\nimpact.\nWhile Anomalisa may seem like a\nclassic tale of short-lived intimacy,\na romance that falls away as the\nsun comes up, the actual film is a\nmuch stranger, off-putting beast.\nKaufman and Johnson do not try\nand make things enjoyable for the\nviewer, putting us through Stone\u2019s\nagonisingly awkward encounters,\nmaking palpable the unbridgeable\ngap between himself and others.\nAnyone who has touched down late\nat night knows the feeling made\nclear in Anomalisa, which by and\nlarge takes place in neutral spaces:\nthe back of a taxi cab; the arrivals\narea of an airport; the faceless hotel\nroom, stacked up with innumerable\nother identical cubes in the\nFregoli Hotel (Fregoli Delusion: a\npsychiatric disorder characterised by a\nbelief that multiple people are the same\nperson in disguise). A hotel room is\nanother world, a beige world, one\nwhere \u2013 if only for a night \u2013 you can\nbe someone else, somewhere else.\nIt\u2019s an anomaly, a break-point with\nyour old life, from which you came\nand to which you will return. It can\nbe the loneliest place in the world.\nKaufman and Johnson make\ncoherent this myriad of impressions.\nThe room becomes an emblem\nfor the alienation of Stone, who\nis really, above all, simply tired.\nThewlis imbues his northern lilt\nwith a lethargic quality, one that\nonly lifts when he meets Lisa. Jason\nLeigh is, similarly, stellar, with her\nquiet, strained delivery of Cyndi\nLauper's \u2018Girls Just Wanna Have\nFun\u2019becoming one of the emotional\ncentre-points of the film.\nTherearelinkstoLostinTranslation\nhere, but for me, the closest link\nis to the work of the late Satoshi\nKon, particularly his 2006 film\nPaprika, which shared Anomalisa\u2019s\nbeguiling sense of stepping into\na waking dream, crafting a world\nthat is simultaneously familiar and\nunapproachable. A sterling piece of\nwork from Kaufman and Johnson,\nAnomalisa is a modern marvel, an\nexploration of what it means to be\nhuman. It\u2019s not about how we feel\nlove, or how we feel pain. Anomalisa\nis really just about how we feel.\nFRED FYLES\nAnomalisa\nis an\nexploration\nof what it\nmeans to\nbe human\nThe hotel\nroom\nbecomes\nan emblem\nof modern\nlife's\nalienation\n\n"

Photo Credit: Imperial Lacrosse\nThe first team came top of the league\nelement to a historically defensive\nteam,and the most amazing support\nfrom the club as a whole, especially\nfrom our president David Reed who\nhas led many excursions deep into\nthe bin.\nFinal year, Ahranee Canden, has\nbeen unshakeable this season in\ngoal, only letting in 23 goals in the\nleague. She is an amazing asset to\nthe team and will be sorely missed\nnext season.\nVice Captain Georgie Carson\nhas been an incredible force in the\nmid-field play and has lead dynamic\nattacking plays, converting scores of\nopportunities.\nHowever, the season is not over\nyet and with the team vying for\npromotion to the Premiership\ntraining never ends. Promotion to\nthe premiership would be a first for\nLacrosse, and any new recruits to\nMed and Nicky\u2019s Fan Club would\nbe gratefully received.\nT\nhe Cross Country team\nbegan the road season in\nbreath-taking style last\nweekend, storming to\nvictory in the Men\u2019s team category\nat the Salisbury 10 mile. A road\nrace that ranks in stature alongside\nthe likes of the London Marathon,\nthe Tour de France, and the Indy\n500; fourteen of Imperial\u2019s leanest\nathletes took to this hallowed\nstart line with the scent of success\nin their nostrils. With Chris\nThomas\u2019s infamous bowels suitably\ncleared, the starting gun heralded\nthe passing of 723 runners over\nundulating tarmac that ran through\nexotic Wiltshire countryside.\nTeam gold was the men\u2019s objective,\nand the team\u2019s strategy was perfectly\nexecuted.With the top four runners\nscoring, Chris Thomas and James\nEllis paired up at the front with\nindividual silverware in sight,\nwhile Matt Douthwaite took Alex\nWarnakulasuriya for a run that\nwas metronomically paced by our\ntowering stalwart. Tom Miller.\nAdamMalagowski,DuncanIngram,\nLewis Jackson, Anil Keshwani and\nWilly Bonneuil all ran admirably in\npursuit in a team performance that\nembodied the spirit of our club.This\nis a group that fights equally as hard\nfor collective success as it does for\npersonal bests, and this spirit was\nreflected in everyone\u2019s results.\nLocal hero Alex Mundell, Leanne\nLyons and Antoinette Hardijzer\nrepresented the ladies. What they\nlacked in numbers they made up\nfor in their performances. Alex blew\nthe Senior Ladies field to pieces in\none hour and eight minutes,coming\nfifth in her category. Leanne and\nAntoinette followed home in\nsuperb fashion, finishing eighth and\nthirty-fourth respectively in times\nthat beckon great seasons for both\nof them. There is great potential for\na ladies\u2019 team victory in the near\nfuture, and our results will surely\ntempt more members of the Club\nonto the road, giving us the girls\nand firepower we need to win the\nhonours we deserve.\nThe men\u2019s victory was secured\nwith an aggregate time of three\nhours and 48 minutes. All four\nrunners covered the distance\nin under an hour, putting three\nminutes between Imperial and\nLordshill Road Runners. Chris and\nJames received silverware for their\nsecond and fourth place finishes,\nand the men were awarded a cup\nsizeable enough to fulfil a number\nof functions at our next social.\nReports of Alex Warna depositing\nhis breakfast several times on the\nfinishing straight are unconfirmed\nafter an epic sprint finish.\nSpecial credit goes to incoming\nLadies\u2019 Captain Alex Mundell,\nwho managed the team so capably\nthroughout the weekend. This truly\nwas one of the highlights of the\nathletics calendar.Our rival London\nThe Imperial March\ncolleges will look upon these results\nwith trepidation, as we continue the\nImperial March on the track,for the\nfirst round of the LCAS track and\nfield championships this weekend.\nThe team\u2019s\nstrategy\nwas\nperfectly\nexecuted Off they go!

I guess\nit\u2019s just because I had a series of\nboyfriends, quite a few guy friends\nand used to be pretty flirty with\nthem all. But for some reason it just\ndidn\u2019t happen, and now I\u2019m sat here\nas a 20 year old still holding onto\nmy \u201cprecious flower\u201d.\nOne thing I have realised is that\nthere\u2019s a lot more of us virgins\nout there than most people think,\nwhether it be due to religious,\nmoral, or spiritual reasons or not.\nThere\u2019s one in my kitchen in halls,\nand two in my friendship group on\nmy course.\nI\u2019ve also realised that it\u2019s not\nsomething that is frowned upon as\nmuch now that I\u2019m 20, compared\nto when I was 17. I used to lie and\nmake excuses for why I never took\nT\nhe trusty condom, or \u2018Venus shirt\u2019, as they say in\nPortugal, is probably the most popular form of\ncontraception. I\u2019ve always found them to be a reliable\nfriend. They\u2019re cheap \u2013 often free (can stock up by\nthe wheelbarrow-load from any good student union), easy, and\neffective \u2013 both in terms of not having babies (they\u2019ve done me\nproud so far) and in avoiding nasty diseases, something not found\nso much in other contraceptive methods.\nI know a lot of guys complain they don\u2019t \u201cfeel as much\u201d\nwhen using them, which I don\u2019t think should be written off as\njust selfishness \u2013 it\u2019s a legitimate gripe. But for convenience,\neffectiveness, and lack of side-effects, I don\u2019t think you can go\nwrong with rubber.\nSafe sex should be\nsomething to shout about\nI\nn the UK, we\u2019re lucky\nenough to have access to free\ncontraception, regardless\nof who you are. The NHS\nprovides 15 different methods,\nranging from the provision of free\ncondoms, to implanted devices, to\nsterilisation procedures, which have\nvarying rates of effectiveness up to\nmore than 99%.\nAs long as you\u2019re making sure\nyou\u2019re being safe, there\u2019s no right\nor wrong type of contraception,\nand which method suits you best\nwill depend on your body and\nlifestyle. For some, taking the pill\nis a perfect solution, and for others,\nit\u2019s just impossible to remember.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that\ncontraception has two purposes\n\u2013 preventing pregnancy, and\npreventing STIs. With the nasties\nthat are being passed around\nbecoming increasingly antibiotic-resistant, it\u2019s always better to be safe\nthan sorry, use a condom, and get\ntested regularly.\nGetting tested can be a daunting\nexperience, particularly when you\u2019re\ngoing there already feeling guilty\nfor being a bit irresponsible. All\nthose horror stories about umbrellas\nup your urethra are nothing but\nthat \u2013 stories. Most STIs are very\ntreatable, particularly if you catch\nthem early \u2013 there\u2019s no reason to\nCondoms The implant\nT\nhe procedure for getting the implant seems\nunnecessarily sadistic: you have to pick the thing\nup yourself from a pharmacy, and the transparent\npackaging leaves you with no doubt as to how gigantic\na needle is soon to be thrust into your arm.\nDespite the intense dread after staring at the blade for about\na week, I made it to my session, and the only thing I felt was\nthe prick of the anaesthetic (and relief at my new immunity to\nbabies). The implant works for me because I literally don\u2019t have\nto do anything for 3 years (when on the pill I forgot it on more\ndays than I remembered), and, apart from a weird month-long\none to start with, it completely stopped my periods. A warning to\nthe squeamish, though: I can totally see/feel it through my skin.\nThe pill\nT\nhe pill. A tiny, revolutionary, sugar-coated (literally)\nball of pure lady hormone. Or maybe they\u2019re synthetic\n(actually don\u2019t tell me, if it\u2019s grown in pigs like insulin\nas that\u2019s definitely not halal and the premarital sex is\nbad enough). The concept is simple \u2013 you pop a pill everyday, or\nmaybe 21 days out of every 28, and suddenly have full autonomy\nover your fertility, periods and life. Go you!\nI\u2019d recommend this to any womb-bearer who wants a fuss free\nway to stay baby-free, or anyone who\u2019s about to go travelling and\ndoesn\u2019t want to get their period at a Full Moon Party. You might\nhave heard horror stories \u2013 anything from changes of mood\nto getting a bit chubby, but your first dalliance into hormonal\ncontraception is much like when Harry Potter first arrived at the\nwand shop on Diagon Alley. Some aren\u2019t going to suit, and may\nwell fuck shit up, but you can keep trying different brands (there\nare hundreds) until you find one that makes beautiful Patronuses.\nT\nhere are a few things to consider about the IUD.\n1: Getting one. This is annoying. You\u2019ll need a\ncervical smear and to wait weeks for the results. Then\nyou need to go in and get your cervix forcibly dilated\nand the IUD inserted.This is not at all fun.They tell you to take a\npainkiller. Do it. I then felt awful for the rest of the day.\n2: Having one. So, my periods got heavier and more painful. I\nhad to get prescription painkillers for this. Also, the strings can\nspike a guy\u2019s boner \u2013 be warned.\n3: Why bother? It lasts five years, it\u2019s \u201calways on\u201d, has an\namazingly low failure rate and doesn\u2019t mess with your head even\na bit. I can\u2019t take the Pill and have a latex allergy, so it\u2019s about all\nthat\u2019s left. At the same time... I don\u2019t have to worry, at all, about\npregnancy for five years.That\u2019s pretty sweet!\nThe IUD\nThe morning after pill\nT\nhe morning after pill is intended to be an emergency\nsolution rather than a planned contraceptive \u2013 but,\nfor reasons best known to my 18-year-old self, one of\nthe two occasions on which I used it was decidedly\nplanned.\nI didn\u2019t get pregnant (yay) or get any of the possible side effects\n(like nausea or abnormal periods),but I did have to pay \u00a322 to buy\nit online and walk all the way to Superdrug when it was raining.\nThe other time was actually a last resort and involved doing\nsome Googling, going to a pharmacy that\u2019d give it to me straight\naway and being briefly interrogated by a doctor before getting it\nfor free. I\u2019d probably buy one to keep around if I weren\u2019t on other\ncontraception now,just in case I couldn\u2019t get to a pharmacy or just\ndidn\u2019t feel like talking to a doctor.\nI\ntook the mini-pill when I was younger, but the hormones\ndidn\u2019t gel well with the combination of my teenaged body\nand polycystic ovaries, and I ended up spending months\nsoul searching over about why I was so depressed all of a\nsudden. Needless to say, that didn\u2019t last long.\nWanting to avoid anything that would mess with my brain again,\nI used condoms for years, but eventually took the step towards\nfive years of worry-free sex, and got the Mirena coil installed.\nHaving it put in was a bit of a hassle (no one enjoys having their\nlegs in stirrups in front of the doctor and assisting nurse), but it\nwasn\u2019t particularly painful. Unfortunately, I did suffer an unusual\nreaction, causing me to go into shock, meaning it did take a week\nor so before I was full back to normal.\nIn the three years since, I\u2019ve never had a period, had severe\ncramps, or had to worry at all about getting pregnant. And I\nstill don\u2019t need to think about it for another two years. Should\neveryone be getting a coil? I think yes.\nThe IUS\nFind that someone who makes you feel shiny and new. Photo Credit: Sire\nRecords/Warner Bros\nbe nervous. London has so many\nfantastic sexual health clinics (some\nof which specialise, if you want\nto talk about something specific)\nwhich are friendly, non-judgmental,\nand completely anonymous. By\nnot getting tested regularly, you\u2019re\nputting yourself and anyone you\nhave sex with at risk, so make sure\nthat you take the time to get it done.\nAs well as treatable STIs, there\nare some that become life-long\nconditions, such as HIV or hepatitis\nB. These days, there are post-exposure treatments to prevent\ninfection, as well as methods of\nmanaging them long-term, should\nyou be diagnosed. The NHS\nprovides many widely available\ntypes of support, both in terms of\ntreatment and emotional support.\nIf you have been diagnosed, or feel\nthat you may be at risk, seeking\nadvice as soon as possible can really\nmake the difference.\nAnd if you do find yourself in the\nposition of having an unplanned\npregnancy, the NHS also offers\nsupport for all of your available\noptions, whether or not that means\nending the pregnancy. Either way,\nyour GP or a GUM clinic can refer\nyou to the right people, and again,\nit\u2019s better to know sooner rather\nthan later.\nSex is one of the most fun ways to\npass the time between lectures, and\nI encourage all who want to do it, to\ndo it as much as they like, as long as\nit\u2019s safe and consensual. Have fun!\nAnonymous\nWriter\nthe plunge, but now I accept that\neverything happens for a reason.\nI still haven\u2019t found out what that\nreason is, but I think there probably\nwill be one.\nPersonally I now just accept it\nand don\u2019t shy away when people\nask, \u201chow many boys have you slept\nwith?\u201d Instead of making it a big\ndeal, I just make a joke out of it,\nbecause now I\u2019ve accepted it, why\nshouldn\u2019t other people?\nI don\u2019t have anything against\npeople who go out and have one\nnight stands, and I don\u2019t judge them\nfor it \u2013 I just know that\u2019s not the kind\nof thing I want to be doing. I don\u2019t\nthink I\u2019m missing out too much; it\u2019s\nnot like I don\u2019t have any experience\nwith boys. I go out, get drunk, and\nkiss boys just like everyone else \u2013 I\njust don\u2019t end up going home with\nthem at the end of the night.\nAt the end of the day it really\nisn\u2019t as big a deal as everyone makes\nout. Whether it happens tomorrow\nor when I\u2019m married, it\u2019ll happen\nwhen it happens and I\u2019m fine with\nthat.\n\n"
