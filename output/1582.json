So ends the\nonslaught of big summer blockbusters\n\u2013 an onslaught that\u2019s seen the likes of\nGuardians of the Galaxy, possibly the\nyear\u2019s most entertaining film so far,\nbut an onslaught nonetheless.\nAs the next season of films\napproaches, the time to start\nthrowing around phrases like \u2018Oscar\nnomination\u2019 in relation to almost\nany film that bears even a passing\nsemblance of quality creeps ever\nnearer. The Autumn and Winter\nof 2014 hold a glut of big names,\nincluding more than a few genuine\n- yes, already - contenders for the\nbig prizes come awards season. Cue\nmontage!\nApparently I can\u2019t do montages\nin print. That\u2019s disappointing. Cue\nexcited list of big releases!\nGONE GIRL\n3rd October\nThe first film should already be\nout by the time you read this, but\nconsider that a bonus - it means this\nlist has already begun. The quality\nfilms are already here. Directed\nby twisted genius David Fincher,\nadapted from the novel by the actual\nauthor Gillian Flynn, and starring\nfuture man in a bat costume Ben\nAffleck alongside Rosamund Pike as\nthe eponymous \u2018girl\u2019, Gone Girl oozes\npotential. And if the whirlwind of\npositive reviews are anything to go\nby: it delivers. Dark, brooding, and\na brutally insightful demolition of\nmarried life: it\u2019s got Fincher written\nall over it. Alongside the words \u2018Must\nSee\u2019.\nTHE MAZE RUNNER\n10th October\nPart of me contemplated leaving The\nMaze Runner off this list, what with\nit being yet another YA adaptation.\nThen the other part of me pointed\nto its strong cast, enticing trailer,\nand the good-kind-of-mixed (from\n\u2018good\u2019 to \u2018great\u2019) reviews that seem\nto suggest the film manages to pull\noff its premise while dodging the\nproblem that befell the likes of\nDivergent (couldn\u2019t distinguish itself\nJACK STEADMAN\nCINEMA CHAIR\nNeed a cinema? Look no further...\nELLEN MATHIESON\nSECTION EDITOR\nWhether you\u2019re a Fresher who has\njust moved to London, or an experienced final year who can barely\nremember what that felt like, you are\nstill reading the film section of Felix\nand that means that you probably\nhave a bit of interest in films. So\nwhere are the best places to see all\nthe latest cinema releases in London?\nRead on to find out!\nFirstly you\u2019ve got your pretty\nstandard places. For those staying in Evelyn Gardens, you have\nthe Fulham Road Cineworld just\naround the corner, probably less than\na minute away and the place that I\nspent far too much time in in first\nyear. It\u2019s one of two Cineworlds in\nthe area, and tends to show the more\nblockbuster-y releases. If you prefer\nmore unusual films, check out the\nChelsea Cineworld on Kings Road,\nwhich is only ten minutes away from\nthe Evelyn Gardens halls. For those\nin halls nearer to campus, you have\nthe High Street Kensington Odeon,\nonly a twenty minute walk to the west\nof College.\nIf this isn\u2019t enough for you, then it\nall depends on what you are looking for in a film. If you are a massive film nerd, then make sure that\nyou check out some of the places in\nLeicester Square. Packed with massive\ncinemas equipped with the largest\nscreens you\u2019ll find in the country,\nthis is where almost all of the UK film\npremieres happen. Keep an eye on\npremiere dates and get down early\nenough and you could find yourself\nseeing (or maybe even getting things\nsigned by if you\u2019re super keen and\nearly) the likes of Jennifer Lawrence\nor Emma Watson, or whoever your\ncurrent film crush is. In terms of\nactual cinemas, you\u2019ve got the enormous Odeon which tends to host\nmost of those premieres I mentioned,\nas well as a ton of smaller ones close\nby that show everything from your\nmassive blockbusters to tiny artsy\nfilms that you\u2019ve never even heard\nof. You\u2019ve also got the Empire, which\nused to have the largest screen in\nEurope before they decided to cut it\nin half. Visiting any of these cinemas\nis an amazing experience so definitely\ntry to make your way there at least\nonce.\nIf you\u2019re still on the search for a\nstupidly, amazingly enormous screen,\nthen the BFI IMAX is the place for\nyou. It\u2019s situated five minutes from\nWaterloo station, a quick tube ride\nfrom South Ken. With a screen that\u2019s\ntwenty metres in length and twenty\nsix metres wide, this is now the largest\nscreen in Britain. In addition to this,\nthey\u2019ve got the Nolan Batman trilogy\non 70mm (the standard IMAX film\nprint size), which they tend to do\nshowings of about once a term. This is\ndefinitely the place to see your big scifi films like Gravity and the upcoming\nInterstellar.\nIf you are more of the sort of\nperson who goes out of their way to\nwatch any film people dub \u2018so bad\nit\u2019s good\u2019, then the Prince Charles\nCinema is probably the right place\nfor you to be. Once again it\u2019s located\nin the centre of London, very close\nto Leicester Square. With frequent\nshowings of such classics as the Rocky\nHorror Picture Show and The Room, if\nyou want to get your fish net tights or\nyour spoons out then this might be\nthe cinema for you. If you think that\nyou are too serious for that sort of\nfilm, then they also show many cult\nclassics and do film marathons of all\nyour favourites including Star Wars,\nLord of the Rings, and Nolan\u2019s Batman\ntrilogy. Name a film series and they\u2019ll\nprobably marathon it at some point.\nIf you\u2019re coming across from Asia\n(or love Asian cinema) and are worried about missing all your local film\nfrom The Hunger Games), or The Host/\nMortal Instruments/any other YA adap\nyou care to name (almost universally\nhurriedly put together without much\nattention to quality). Worth a look, it\nseems.\nNIGHTCRAWLER\n31st October\nThere\u2019s a line of comparison to be\ndrawn between Travis Bickle and\nLou Bloom, the amoral protagonist\nof Nightcrawler, the latest flick from\nDan Gilroy. It\u2019s a line that can mostly\nbe illustrated with psychopathic\ntendencies, but if the early buzz\nsuggests anything it\u2019s that it can\nalso be illustrated with the strength\nof the performance. Already being\ntouted as Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s finest\nperformance - he even lost 20lb for\nit, which (as Christian Bale will surely\ntell you) always gets the awards panel\ngoing - there\u2019s a lot to recommend\nNightcrawler, not least the apparent\nstrength of its laceration of modern\nmedia.\nINTERSTELLAR\n7th November\nIt\u2019s at this point I actually stopped\nwriting to go and check if tickets for\nInterstellar were actually on sale yet\n(they weren\u2019t). To say there\u2019s a lot\nof hype about this film would be an\nunderstatement - and yet, as ever\nwith Christopher Nolan films, we\nknow almost nothing about it. Yes, it\ninvolves space travel, yes, it involves\nwormholes, and yes it stars Matthew\nMcConaughey on his continued\nastronomical (that wasn\u2019t originally\na pun, I promise) career renaissance.\nThat much I can definitely tell you.\nAs more information slowly leaks\nout, Interstellar looks ever more\npromising - but really, it\u2019s almost\nbetter not knowing. Trust in Chris\nNolan, buy your ticket as soon as\nthey\u2019re on sale, and look forward\nto what may well be the film of the\nyear. And hopefully - hopefully - the\nfilm that finally sees Nolan get the\nAcademy recognition he deserves.\nTHE IMITATION GAME\n14th November\nBenedict Cumberbatch playing Alan\nTuring. It\u2019s okay, I can see you\u2019re\nsold already. An immensely talented\ncast (Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley\n- don\u2019t make snide remarks, she can\nact and you know it, Mark Strong,\nCharles Dance) are set to bring the\ntale of Alan Turing, the man who\nhelped save a country that later\npersecuted him for his sexuality,\nto the big screen. And it is set to be\nincredible.\nTHE HUNGER GAMES\nMOCKINGJAY PART 1\n20th November\nI couldn\u2019t go and put a YA adap in\nthis list and then neglect to include\nthe YA adap, could I? Especially not\nwhen The Hunger Games continues\nto earn its wings - the second entry\nwas an even better film than the\nfirst, despite fears that is much faster\nturn-around could prove harmful to\nquality. The third film - following\nthe now traditional trope of splitting\nthe final book into two parts - looks\nlikely to continue that upward trend,\nwith the likes of Julianne Moore\nand Natalie Dormer joining the\ncast, as well as all the returning big\nnames that were already in the series.\nIncluding, of course, the late, great\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman. For that\nalone, this is unmissable. Throw in\neverything else this film has going\nfor it - only Interstellar can possibly\npromise more.\nTHE HOBBIT BATTLE OF THE\nFIVE ARMIES\n12th December\nThe arrival of December sees the\nfinal entry in the Lord of the Rings/\nThe Hobbit series, despite almost\neveryone ever\u2019s reservations about\nturning a single children\u2019s book\ninto three films. Despite that, Peter\nJackson and co have mostly managed\nto pull things off with aplomb,\nwith last year\u2019s The Desolation of\nSmaug a far stronger entry than its\npredecessor, featuring a show-stealing\nturn from Benedict Cumberbatch\nas the eponymous dragon. General\nHobbit film fatigue might make\nthis final film look less tempting\n(the trailer certainly felt weirdly\u2026\nunappealing), but the series still holds\nan undeniable draw.\nOTHER FILMS THAT ARE ALSO\nPROBABLY AMAZING\nIf you like your horrors, The Babadook\n(24th October) is apparently a good\nbet, with a combination of its well-handled aesthetic and a terrifying\nnew creation in the eponymous\nBabadook combining in what may\nbe this year\u2019s best example of the\ngenre. Those longing for something\nless scary might want to check out\nThe Judge (17 October), a rare serious\nouting for Robert Downey Jr about an\nattorney who has to defend his judge\nfather in a hit-and-run case.\nAnyone looking for something\nmore action-orientated can head over\nto David Ayer\u2019s big-name cast in Fury\n(22 October), his WWII tank epic,\nwhile those looking for something\neven quieter should be flocking to\nMike Leigh\u2019s Mr Turner (31st October),\na biopic of the great painter starring\nthe ever-excellent Timothy Spall at\nhis most excellent.\nHaving just looked back at all of\nthose dates: October is a busy month.\nBe excited.\nreleases back home, then check out\nthe Asia Centre. Found in West London, they have a dedicated cinema on\nsite, and frequently host the UK premiere of many Eastern films during\nthe Pan-Asian film festival that they\nhold each year. It\u2019s a great event and\na great chance to see films that might\notherwise pass you by.\nIf you\u2019re a total cinema tech geek,\nor looking for a more indulgent ex-perience, head down to the Olympic\nCinema in Barnes. It\u2019s one of the only\nplaces in the country that you can\nfind Dolby Atmos, a sound system\nthat consists of shoving a ton of\nspeakers in the ceiling which means\nthat the film\u2019s audio moves across\nthe room, effectively creating \u20183D\nsound\u2019. In addition to this, you\u2019ve got:\nsquashy reclinable seats; foot rests for\nthe front seats; plenty of gratuitous\ncurtain usage, and sofas for cuddling -making it perfect for a date night.\nAnd finally, if you\u2019re dying to catch\nthe releases that you missed in their\ninitial cinema run, then don\u2019t forget\nour very own Imperial Cinema\n(which I may or may not be involved\nin running), which shows films a little\nwhile after the commercial cinemas\nfor a fraction of the price. Found on\nthe second floor of the Union build-ing, it\u2019s also one of those rare cinemas\nthat lets you buy a pint in the bar and\nenjoy it whilst you watch the film.\nThe BFI IMAX is near Waterloo Station.

I\u2019ve also been doing work on\nthe response to the closure of the \u2018post\nstudy work visa for international\nstudents\u2019.\nB: Can you comment on the\nclosure of the Evelyn Gardens\nhalls? What would you do it\nanything like that happened again?\nC: My personal view is that College\nshould make Evelyn Gardens halls\navailable for students after the\nredevelopment, even if the rent is\nhigher, because it is still a better\nsituation than having to live in Acton\n\u2013 where students are still paying a\nhigh rent and have to pay travel costs.\nB: Why do you not think the\nUnion was not listened to when\nthe decision was being made about\nActon halls?\nC: There was a confidentiality\nagreement. College had already made\na decision and signed the contract\nbefore the \u2018Against Acton\u2019 campaign.\nThe campaign was too little, too late.\nThis is sad, but I honestly don\u2019t think\nthe Union could have done anything\nto have changed their mind.\nB: Is there anything you want to\nchange this year which involves\nCollege participation?\nC: I think the counselling service\nneeds drastic improvement. The\nwait is too long and it\u2019s understaffed.\nI think it needs more funding.\nI\u2019m working with College on the\nWellbeing task group, but I think it\nwon\u2019t affect the students right here,\nwho need help now.\nB: Do you think the average\nstudent would be able to properly\njudge how you have performed at\nyour job?\nC: I\u2019ve always been very wary of\nsaying that voters aren\u2019t informed\nenough to make decisions. I\u2019ve always\nfelt strongly that people are very\nintelligent and are capable of making\ninformed decisions. At the end of the\nyear, I could make a case of how I did,\nand I think students should be able to\nmake a decision on that. I trust voters.\nB: Okay, let's have some fun\nquestions. What is your biggest\nonline timewaster?\nC: I don\u2019t actually use those. I use\nWikipedia, but I\u2019m not a big editor of\nit\u2026 I read a lot of blogs and the news\nonline. I generally try and do that\nduring my lunch break than when I\u2019m\nsupposed to be working. I read various\npolitical blogs and politicalbetting.\ncom, not that I\u2019m not a big gambler, I\njust find it interesting.\nB: With the current sabbs, if\nyou were trapped on a desert\nisland with them, who would you\ncollectively decide to eat first?\nC: Tom Wheeler would probably\nbe the last survivor because he does a\nlot of outdoor stuff. I would probably\nbe the first to go, but I don\u2019t have\nvery much meat, so I might not be\na tactical first meal. That\u2019s a very\ninteresting question which I can\u2019t\nanswer in a diplomatic way.\nB: If you had to have tinder, what\nbio would you have?\nC: \u2018IF I had to have tinder?!\u2019 That\u2019s\na very hypothetical question! In my\nbio I would say that I was a Chemistry\ngraduate, that I\u2019m being paid in a job,\nand that I am 6 foot tall, even though\nI am only 5 foot 11.5. So yeah: 6 foot\ntall, salary, graduate.\nB: Hmm, very informative.\nAnd positive! Which Imperial\nestablishment would you go for\nyour first date in?\nC: Not the Union! Because the risk\nof me running into someone I know\nwould be too high and too awkward\nand embarrassing. Probably Eastside\nbar, because it almost looks like it\u2019s\nnot on a university campus at all.\nB: If you were allowed to name a\nUnion drinking place, like h-bar or\nMetric, what would you name it?\nC: I\u2019d probably name it the Holland\nClub. I\u2019d make sure it had some\npersonality and charm. Unlike h-bar.\nB: Can you recommend any bars\nor nightclubs for the Freshers? Or\nany to avoid?\nC: Avoid at all costs Ministry of\nSound. It\u2019s a nightmare to get to, it\u2019s\na bigger nightmare to get back from,\nit\u2019s overrated and they treat you like a\nterrorist when you walk in because of\nthe metal detectors.\nI\u2019m not really a big clubber, I prefer\nbars where music is quiet enough to\nhave a conversation.\nEastside bar has proper beer, unlike\nthe Union\u2026 no don\u2019t say that!\n\"I decided\nto donate\nto the\nHardship\nfund,\nbecause not\neveryone\nwho gets a\nscholarship\nneeds the\nmoney.\"\n\"Eastside\nbar has\nproper\nbeer,\nunlike the\nUnion\u2026\"\n\"Avoid at all costs\nMinistry of Sound...\nthey treat you like a\nterrorist when you\nwalk in because of\nthe metal detectors.\"\n\"[Against Acton]\nwas too little, too\nlate. This is sad,\nbut I honestly\ndon't think the\nUnion could have\ndone anything\nto have changed\nCollege's mind.\"\nBernadett Tildy\nChris Kaye, Deputy\nPresident (Welfare),\nEastside enthusiast and\nproud owner of a giant\nportrait of the Queen\ntalks to Felix about his\nplans for next year, his\nday to day activity and\nwhether or not he really\nthinks his role should be\nabolished...\nB: Where are you from, and how\nhas it affected your outlook on\nImperial?\nC: I\u2019m from Bristol. I suppose\nBristol isn\u2019t that diverse, so coming\nto London, specifically Imperial, has\nbeen a very enjoyable experience for\nme, meeting lots of different people\nfrom lots of different countries. It\u2019s\nbeen great.\nB: What do you plan to do after\nyour sabbatical year?\nC: That\u2019s a very good question.\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve give\nit quite a lot of thought to, but I\ndidn\u2019t have time to do a lot of job\napplications in the final year of my\ndegree last year, and then when I ran\nfor elections and won, I was quite\nrelieved.\nEven if I did have a job lined up,\nI would have taken the sabb year\ninstead, because I\u2019ve always wanted\nto contribute to the union and I\u2019m\nhappy to have this job for a year.\nI\u2019m not sure about afterwards, I\u2019m\nthinking maybe patent law or just\nteaching.\nB: Did you always plan to run for\na sabbatical position?\nC: Erm. Yes, I think so. I\u2019ve always\nbeen rather cynical about the Union.\nAnd I thought \u2018why not put my\nmoney where my mouth is?\u201d\nB: Why Welfare?\nC: Support for students is\nsomething I\u2019ve always cared very\ndeeply about. I think it\u2019s an area\nthe College is not doing enough in,\nit\u2019s something I ought to improve.\nA lot of people have a tough time\nat Imperial and I don\u2019t think the\nsupport is there.\nB: Have you been personally\naffected?\nC: It\u2019s not something I want to go\ninto. But, yes, I\u2019ve had issues while\nI\u2019ve been here. And I know others\nwho have too, and it\u2019s not just people\nwho are here and struggling, some\npeople have left and didn\u2019t finish\ntheir degrees after they couldn\u2019t cope\nbecause the support wasn\u2019t there. I\nthink it\u2019s very sad.\nB: So why did you say you think\nthe role of DP Education and\nWelfare could be combined?\nC: I\u2019ve always thought the Union\nhas been rather bloated. Because\nImperial is primarily an academic\ninstitution, I\u2019ve always found it hard\nto arbitrarily separate the roles of\neducation and student welfare. But,\nto \u2018abolish the role\u2019 was never a part\nof my manifesto! It\u2019s something I\nsuspect I may change my views on as\nthe year progresses. At this moment\nin time, I\u2019m still cynical about the\nneed for five full-time officer trustees\nas well as Felix editor and Medic\nPresident.\nB: Do you interact with Pascal,\nDeputy President (Education) a lot?\nDo you still not feel like there are\ntwo separate jobs which need full-time employees?\nC: I\u2019m still not convinced. But term\nhasn\u2019t properly started yet, so maybe\nwhen 3000 new people arrive, my\nviews may change?\nB: Does that mean that you\nhaven't been busy?\nC: I\u2019ve had times where I\u2019ve been\nbusy and some days where I\u2019ve\nnot been. Some days at the start of\nAugust, I\u2019ve had nothing to do but\ntwiddle my thumbs. Work has started\nto pick up now, which I\u2019m quite\nrelieved about.\nB: Is this the reason why you've\ndecided to give away a third of\nyour wage?\nC: Well, no. My justification for\ndoing that is because I think the\nrole is overpaid. I think there are\npeople who will quite happily do the\nrole for significantly less than the\ncurrent salary. Especially if you take\ninto consideration that we get free\naccommodation. Even with me giving\na third of my salary away, it\u2019s more\nthan sufficient to live in London.\nB: How do you think the other\nsabbs feel about you giving up a\nthird of your salary?\nC: I think they\u2019re probably\nsurprised I\u2019m doing what I said I\nwould do.\nB: Is your donation to Imperial\nbecause you feel passionate about\nsupporting Imperial in general?\nFor example, would you donate a\nsignificant amount of your future\nsalary to Imperial after you leave?\nC: That\u2019s a good question. It\ndepends on how Imperial develops.\nI\u2019m currently here for a year and I can\nactually see where the money goes,\nso it makes me keener to donate. I\noriginally said I would donate to the\nScholarship fund, but I decided to\ndonate to the Hardship fund, because\nnot everyone who gets a scholarship\nneeds the money.\nB: You've said you haven't had\nmuch work to do so far, but can\nyou give a day to day account?\nC: Each day is different. I\u2019ve done\nsome subwarden interviews in the\nevenings, but that\u2019s ended now. This\nweek I was looking through NSS\n\"Some days\nat the start\nof August,\nI've had\nnothing\nto do but\ntwiddle my\nthumbs.\"\n\"I've always\nthought\nthe Union\nhas been\nrather\nbloated...\nI'm still\ncynical\nabout\nthe need\nfor five\nfull-time\nofficer\ntrustees.\"\n\n"

Potential applicants should\nregister their interest for this position by\nemailing:\ncentrefolds@ic.ac.uk\nI am writing this editorial like all\nprevious Felix Editors have done:\nsleep deprived; buzzing on coffee;\nand one hour to go to deadline.\nWelcome to this year\u2019s first issue of\nFelix.\nWe\u2019ve undergone a rebranding,\nwe are still working on the new\nwebsite that should be hitting your\nscreens in the next week, and we are\nlooking forward to moving into the\nnew office. It may have a bright cyan\nwall boasting Union branding to\nremind us who pays the bills, but we\nwill always remain an independent\nstudent voice. Our paper is written\nby students, then students edit it, lay\nit out with care and then spend hours\nlate into the evening pouring over\nevery detail and making it a piece we\nare proud of.\nOr at least, that is what we plan\nto do in theory. This issue was\nconceived through gin-addled late\nnights in up in the union offices,\nmanically inversing the colours of a\ncat and being slightly concerned that\nearly image boards resembled those\nseen in an advertising brainstorm\nfor a cat food manufacturer than a\nstudent newspaper.\nI\u2019m looking forward to everyone\nseeing this issue, and I hope that it\nrepresents a foundation that we plan\nto build on, rather than a final form\nwe will mindlessly replicate week\non week. We have many ideas in the\npipeline that hopefully will play into\nthe dual purpose Felix as a newspaper\nemulates: it is not only a news source\nfor the students and staff of Imperial\nCollege London, but also a platform\nfor students to develop skillsets that\nthey may carry with them into the\nfuture.\nAlthough past editors have gone\non to make waves in the media\nworld after they leave the basement,\nmany other students have left with\nvaluable experience in editing,\ndesign work, photography, and\nwriting. You also make lifelong\nfriends: there is nothing like an all-nighter arguing over the final details\nof a comment article to bring people\ntogether (I hate sappy editorials, so\nmy apologies).\nThis week is not only the \u201cFreshers\u2019\nedition\u201d but also a legitimate first\nissue to begin the year. We\u2019ve\nstopped putting the newspaper\ninto the rooms of halls, so instead\nof the gimmicky content previous\ngenerations may remember, we\ninstead have a more well-rounded\nissue for first years and final years\nalike. Whether you are reading\nmy rambles in the library caf\u00e9 in\nbetween classes again, or simply\nstaring at the page blankly whilst\nhungover in your kitchens in halls,\nthis issue should have something\nfor everyone, something hopefully\nwe can say about Felix the club and\nFelix the paper for the rest of the\nyear.\nFeel like getting involved?\nFancy making friends? Bored on\na Wednesday? Come down to the\noffice and say hi. Everyone featured\nin this paper did so at one point\nand another, and every editor\nfrom previous years had to start\nsomewhere. Give it a shot. We print\nnearly everything we are sent at any\nrate, so do it just to send a clipping\nhome to your mother if nothing else.\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\n\n"

    "content": "Games Editor Max Eggl & Calum Skene\nGames\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTHE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 28\nFELIX\nFive Games Every Fresher Should Have\nBored of the library? Don\u2019t worry, Calum Skene can help you out\nA sacrifice many people have to\nmake when they come to university\nis to leave behind their XBOX or\nPlaystation. Hopefully something\nyou have brought with you though\nis a laptop, iPad or portable gaming\ndevice that so far in your life might\nhave been unplayed in favour of their\nlarger siblings. This is a list of games\nthat should appeal to the young\nstudent. They are all cheap, playable\non these portable devices and provide\nmany hours of distraction from your\nfuture studies.\nThese games all have something\nin common apart from being some\nof my favourites. They are all indie\ngames which I have found as a\nstudent are always a good purchase\nand often entertain me far longer\nthan the big more expensive titles. I\nhave left out two great games from\nmy list that games editor Max Eggl\nmentioned last year.\nThese are Minecraft and Portal 2\nwhich in my opinion are essential\ngames for everyone and I recommend\nyou take a look at his article from last\nyear as well. Here then is my list of\ngames every fresher should have.\nSuper Meat Boy\nSuper Meat Boy is possibly the\ngreatest and most frustrating game\nof all time. In many ways this game\nis a lot like the old Super Mario Bros\ngames except you can jump further\nand higher and will die a lot more in\nsome pretty graphic ways.\nThis game is not for those with no\npatience. Each level is quite short\nand can usually be completed in 20\nseconds or less if you manage to avoid\nall the saws, piles of salt and gaps\nthat will kill you. In reality each level\ncould take you 20 minutes or more of\nrepeated attempts, each time getting\na little closer to the goal.\nThis beauty of this game lies in the\nlovely artwork and simplicity of the\ncontrols. It takes minutes to learn\nhow to play and hours to master.\nThere is something for everyone in\nthis game, from trying to complete\nthe easy levels to trying to complete\nthe game and then mastering\nit to speed run or collecting the\nachievements.\nFor a student this game is easy to\npick up and play a little at a time or\nwaste an entire evening trying to\ncomplete the games later levels. For\na cheap price this game offers much\ngameplay for those patient enough to\npersevere.\nIf you like this game I also\nrecommend picking up the Binding\nof Isaac which is equally simple,\nbeautiful and addictive.\nThomas Was Alone\nFor fans of Portal 2 or other puzzle\nand platform games Thomas Was\nAlone is a great buy. In this game you\nplay as Thomas who is a red rectangle\nwho can jump and fall. Later on you\nmeet some other shapes who each\nhave unique powers and you must\nsuccessfully use these powers as part\nof a team to complete the level.\nThis game has a charming art\nstyle and a narrated story which\nfollows you through the games short\nlevels. This game is overall not very\nlong but will keep you entertained\nas you replay through the story to\nfind hidden extras. The later levels\nalso provide a challenge in either\nplatforming ability or puzzle solving.\nAgain, like Super Meat Boy, this\ngame can be picked up and played\nlevel by level meaning it can fit into\nyour busy student schedule.\nLimbo\nFor me Limbo is the ultimate puzzle\ngame. The game takes place in a\nvery scenic black and white forest in\nwhich you play a young boy searching\nFlatland, is all about manipulating\nthe third dimension. Fez takes place\nin a 2-D world in which you play as\nthe character Gomez who is bestowed\nwith a Fez. The Fez enables our hero\nto rotate the world by 90 degrees (pi/2\nradians). Traversing the world will\nrequire platforming skills in the 2-D\nworld and puzzle solving in the third\ndimension.\nThe goal of the game is to collect\ncubes which come in the completed\nform and also in the form of small\ncubies that make up the big cubes. I\nabsolutely loved the PC version but\nthe game has recently seen a revival\nfor me in the form of the PSVita\nversion.\nIf you have some money to spend\nthe Vita is a great student gaming\ntool and you can play all the games\nin this list except Super Meat Boy\non it. Otherwise all the games are\nPavailable on Steam. With the Vita\nalso comes Playstation plus which\ngives you free games each month and\nis actually where I reacquired Fez.\nThe free games are usually quite\ngood and the subscription covers all\nconsoles meaning you will rack up\nsome great games to play on your\nlarger Playstation devices when you\nget home.\nfor his sister. The game has very\nfew controls (jumping, running,\npulling and pushing items) but the\ngame manages to use these in a lot\nof creative ways which makes the\nlater game challenging. The very\nminimalist calm atmosphere together\nwith a few shocks makes the game\nborder on horror, but at its heart it\u2019s a\npuzzle game.\nThe game is quite long when you\nfirst play it due to the challenging\nnature of the puzzles but you will\nwant to play through it again and\nagain. This game offers a variety of\nhidden items, a hidden level and the\nvery challenging achievement of\nplaying through it in 5 or less deaths.\nThis makes the game very replayable.\nI have reviewed this game already\nso check out that review for more\ndetails.\nFor fans of horror check out the\nfree and terrifying Slenderman- The\nEight Pages.\nFez\nThis is another game I have reviewed\nin the past but it definitely deserves\na mention here. Fez is another\npuzzle-platformer that appeals to me\nas a mathematics student. The game,\npossibly inspired by Edwin Abbot\u2019s\nDeutsche Bank\ndb.com/careers\nAgile minds beg to di\ufb00er\nGlobal Graduate Programs\nLife at Deutsche Bank isn\u2019t about following the crowd.

Why not put this\nto good use by writing for Felix?\nIf you\u2019re desperate to tell the world\nabout your views on fracking, or a\nfascinating new discovery in algebraic\ntopology, drop us an email and we\u2019ll\nadd you to our mailing list. We\u2019re\nalways looking for new contributors,\nand as you\u2019re currently reading this,\nyou\u2019ve definitely shown more than\nenough enthusiasm to make you\neligible to write for us.\nHere are a few pieces of new\nresearch to entertain you in the brief\nlull between joining tea society [surely\nyou mean Felix membership? \u2013ed] and\nengaging in some responsible binge\ndrinking with your new best friends.\nA group at Cornell have once\nagain confirmed our suspicions that\nquantum mechanics is really weird.\nIn their paper, published in Nature,\nthey showed how it\u2019s possible to make\nan image of an object using light that\nhad never been anywhere near it.\nThey created pairs of entangled\nphotons by passing a laser beam\nthrough a crystal, and sent one\ntowards the object (a picture of a cat,\nin an homage to Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger)\nand the other towards a detector.\nBecause the properties of two\nentangled particles are intricately\nrelated, they could see what had\nhappened to one by analysing the\nother.\nAs the two sets of photons can\nhave different wavelengths, this\ntechnique could be used to create\nimages of delicate objects that would\nbe damaged by conventional imaging\ntechniques. Undetectable photons\nof very low energy could be passed\nthrough the object, while high energy\nones hit the detector and actually\ngenerate the image.\nExperiments on mice conducted at\nImperial have shown that inhaling\nXenon gas could limit the extent of\nbrain damage after a serious head\ninjury.\nIn the hours after a major impact,\nneurological damage continues to\nprogress, with these secondary effects\noften causing more harm than the\ninitial event. Unfortunately, there\nare currently no drugs available to\nprevent this.\nInjured mice treated with Xenon, a\nnoble gas which also has anaesthetic\nproperties, demonstrated fewer long\nterm difficulties with movement and\nbalance than those in the control\ngroup. The research builds on\nprevious experiments that showed\nXenon had beneficial effects on\ninjured brain cells in the lab.\nThe group\u2019s findings, published in\nthe journal Critical Care Research, may\nlead the way to future clinical trials in\nhuman patients.\nThe 24th First Annual Ig Nobel\nprize ceremony was held in\nSeptember to showcase research that\n\u201cfirst makes you laugh, then makes\nyou think\u201d. Among the winners of\nthe prestigious award (accompanied\nby 10 trillion Zimbabwean dollars in\nprize money) was a group of Czech\nscientists, who discovered that dogs\nprefer to align their bodies with the\nearth\u2019s magnetic field, but only when\nthey urinate and defecate. This is the\nfirst time that magnetic sensitivity\nhas been confirmed in dogs.\nOther recipients include a group\nfrom the USA and India, who\ndemonstrated that packing the\nnose with cured pork is an effective\ntreatment for severe nosebleeds, and\na team from Italy, who showed that\nlooking at beautiful paintings can\nreduce a person\u2019s experience of pain.\nThe nutrition prize went to a\ngroup of Spanish researchers for\ntheir delightfully titled paper:\n\u201cCharacterization of Lactic Acid\nBacteria Isolated from Infant\nFaeces as Potential Probiotic Starter\nCultures for Fermented Sausages.\u201d\nIt seems that between the\nsensationalist science this summer\nScientists at the University of\nCambridge and the Ecole Normale\nSuperieure Paris working on a joint\nresearch project have discovered\na new phenomenon of the human\nbrain: the ability to perform\nautomated tasks even whilst the\nsubject is unconscious.\nThe study, led by Dr Sid Kouider\nand published in Current Biology,\nshowed that subjects were able\nto classify words during sleep,\nsuggesting the human brain may\nbe more active than we previously\nthought during sleep. Scientists\nrecorded the electroencephalogram\n(EEG) \u2013 a procedure that tracks\nand records the electrical activity\nof the brain as wave patterns \u2013 of\nthe participants whilst awake and\nasked them to classify spoken words\n(e.g. Dog, Stamp) as either animals\nor objects by means of pressing\na button (right hand for animals\nand left hand for objects). The\nprocedure made it possible for the\nresearch team to compute lateralized\nresponse preparations (LRPs), which\nare a neural marker of response\nand preparation, by mapping each\ncategory of words to a specific part of\nactivity in the brain.\nThe participants were placed in\nan environment that would allow\nthem to fall asleep (a dark room,\nin a reclining chair with their eyes\nclosed) but at the same time ensured\nthat they were engaged with the task\n(listening to repetitions of the same\nset of words with an interval of 6-9\nseconds between words). However, the\nset of words was changed during sleep\nto ensure whether the responses were\nbased on the meaning of the word\nitself as opposed to reactivation of a\nstimulus-response association that\nmay have been established when the\nparticipants were awake.\nOn comparison, the EEG patterns\ncomputed whilst participants were\ncompletely motionless and unaware\nshowed considerable similarity to\nwhen participants were awake. This\nhighlighted that the same regions\nof the brain were active (albeit more\nslowly) when the study subjects were\nlistening to a different set of words\nwhilst asleep.\nDr Sid Kouider, from Ecole\nNormale Superieure in Paris who\nled the study, mentioned how this\nstudy shows \u201cthe sleeping brain can\nbe far more \u2018active\u2019... than one would\nimagine... [and] this explains some\neveryday life experiences such as our\nsensitivity to our name in our sleep,\nor to the... sound of our alarm clock,\ncompared to equally loud but less\nrelevant sounds\u201d.\nHowever, he also added that (in his\nview) only tasks which can become\nautomated may be maintained in\nsleep, others will stop as sleep takes\nover. So for now at least, it seems like\na while before we\u2019re cramming our\nlectures in our sleep the week before\nexams.\nNevertheless, their research has\npaved the way for further studies\ninto the processing capacities of the\nhuman brain during slumber.\nthat you may have been fortunate\nto miss, there were some of these\nabstract but exciting endeavours. We\ncover all science stories from silly\nto serious, and if you want to give\nscience writing a go, do get in touch\nwith us!\nImperial professor to lead Ebola vaccine trial\nPotective gear worn by those who are treating ebola patients Photo: UNICEF\nC\u00e9cile Borkhataria on the race to develop a drug for the deadly disease\nThe current Ebola outbreak in West\nAfrica, which began in March 2014,\nhas afflicted Guinea, Sierra Leone,\nLiberia, Nigeria, and recently, Senegal.\nThe death toll has now surpassed\n2800, with the total number of cases\nnumbering 5864. The severity of this\noutbreak is unprecedented; the virus\nfirst surfaced in Congo in 1976, where\nonly 318 cases were reported at the\ntime.\nThe outbreak has spurred on a great\ndeal of aid efforts from international\nhealth care organisations, with the\nlikes of Medecins Sans Frontieres\nsetting up temporary health centres in\nthe afflicted countries to safely treat\nEbola patients.\nCurrently, there is no known cure\nfor Ebola. The virus, which exists in\nfive strains, four of which can infect\nhumans, is transmitted by exchange\nof bodily fluids, and it is thought\nthat the practice of washing the dead\nin rural areas has contributed to the\nrapid spread of the disease.\nPatients are usually given\nsupportive treatment, including\nbalancing fluids and electrolytes,\nas well as procoagulants to prevent\nbleeding, and antibiotics to treat\nsecondary bacterial infections.\nWith the outbreak growing in\nseverity, there has been a frenzy\nof efforts to develop a cure for\nthe deadly disease. A number of\npharmaceutical companies are\ndeveloping vaccines for the virus,\nincluding promising candidates from\nTekmira Pharmaceuticals, Canadian\nbased NewLink Genetics and Inovio\nPharmaceuticals.\nThe most advanced vaccine\ncandidate is arguably produced\nby Glaxo Smith Kline (GSK) and\nconsists of a T-cell based chimpanzee\nadenovirus. GSK\u2019s vaccine is the\nfirst to have started human clinical\ntrials and it has already been shown\nto protect against the virus in\nchimpanzees. The vaccine has been\ntested on humans in the US and the\nUK, with the next arm of trials set to\ntake place in Mali and the Gambia.\nThe Wellcome Trust, the Medical\nResearch Council and the UK\nDepartment for International\nDevelopment has donated a \u00a32.8\nmillion grant towards the efforts,\nwhich has allowed a team led by\nProfessor Adrian Hill, Oxford\nUniversity, to test the vaccine in the\nUK, and will help towards testing the\nvaccine in the Gambia.\nOne of our very own, Professor\nBeate Kampmann from the\nDepartment of Paediatrics at Imperial\nCollege London, is set to run the\nGambia arm of the trial. She is an\nexpert in infection and immunity\ntopics and has already had extensive\nexperience running vaccination trials\nin the Gambia for polio, meningitis\nand other diseases.\nSaid Professor Kampmann on\nthe trial, \u2018The big advantage of\nfast-tracking such an important\ndevelopment is that the funding\nbecomes available more readily.\u201d\nThe trial will recruit 40 healthy\nvolunteers in the Gambia. Professor\nKampmann has said that testing the\nvaccine in West Africa is vital, as this\nwill take into account differences\nbetween West African and European\npopulations with respect to the safety\nFreshers\u2019 Flu: the science behind the sniffles and snot\nLAUREN RATCLIFFE\nSECTION EDITOR\nFreshers\u2019 Week for most is a time\nfull of new experiences, stepping\nout of your usual comfort zone and\nmeeting more new people than you\ncould hope to remember. There are\nvery few instances in your life that\nyou will speak to as many strangers\nin such a short period of time,\nturning awkward conversations\ninto friendships and introducing\nyourself so many times that you start\nto wonder who you are anymore. So\nwith your luggage unpacked and the\nexcitement building, you hold many\nexpectations for the week to come.\nHowever, the anticipated rollercoaster adventure that is your first\nfew weeks at University is also likely\nto bring with it Freshers\u2019 Flu.\nYou have probably heard it\ndescribed as nothing more than a\nglorified hangover. Don\u2019t be fooled.\nFreshers\u2019 flu is real, and there is a\n90%chance you will get it. Despite\nits name, Freshers\u2019 Flu is a blanket\nterm to describe a bad cold rather\nthan flu itself; symptoms range from\nperson to person but usually include\na beautiful mix of coughing, sneezing,\nheadaches and a temperature.\nSo what causes this onslaught of\nbed-ridden freshers? During the first\nfew weeks of university you meet\nhundreds of new people from across\nthe globe. As good as your immune\nsystem is, after being bombarded\nwith such a vast collection of foreign\ninvading pathogens, it is more than\nlikely to encounter one you are not\nalready immune to.\nOn top of this, moving away from\nhome and taking those first steps\nto independence alongside so many\nstrangers can put a lot of stress on\nyour body and mind. Not to mention\nthe binge drinking, fast-food eating\nand general unruly behaviour!\nIf you get struck down, my advice is\nto rest \u2013 this may be the last genuine\nexcuse to miss a lecture, so enjoy it\nand let your body adjust to the new\nenvironment. Don\u2019t feel you need\nto arm yourself with facemasks and\nan NBC suit, instead, if you feel\nunwell perhaps skip the partying and\nboogying for one night.\nA sore throat and headache are\nnothing you can\u2019t handle after some\nfresh lemon and honey tea alongside\na good night\u2019s sleep. Vitamin C tablets\nalso work a treat \u2013 Berocca tablets are\nmy personal favourite cold-busting\ncure, and great for hangovers too!\nDon\u2019t forget to register with Imperial\nHealthcare Centre and make a visit if\nyou feel your symptoms persist.\nIt\u2019s common year on year for\nlecture halls and library study rooms\nalike to bear the ultimate burden of\nFreshers\u2019 Flu: collective coughing.\nHowever you will find that as the\nterm progresses, the noise will\nquieten down, the germs will stop\nspreading and you can proceed once\nmore to hear your lecturer instead of\nthe moans and groans of the invalids\naround you. Just beware for next year,\nwhen the new Freshers arrive!\nand efficacy of the vaccine.\nProfessor Kampmann envisages\nthat the Gambia trials will start in\nOctober, once her team has received\nregulatory approval. It is hoped that\nall trials can be finished by the end of\nthis year. This ambitious timeline will\ndepend on many factors, but some\ncomfort can be taken in knowing that\nresearch efforts are well underway.\nOnly time will tell if GSK\u2019s promising\nvaccine will win the race in developing\nan Ebola vaccine.\n\n"

Photo: MMich\nIt\u2019s easy to stay fed without breaking the bank\nGrab yourself a delicious discount!\nWelcome to the Felix\nFood Kitchen! Here\u2019s\nwhats cooking...\nCAROL ANN CHEAH\nFOOD EDITOR\nIf you\u2019re a fresher (both UG and PG), welcome to Imperial and the first issue of Felix for the year; if you\u2019re\na returning student, welcome back! I\u2019m Caz and I\u2019m\nyour Felix Food Hostess. As far as foodie experiences\nand biases go, mine\u2019s an eclectic mix: I\u2019m a wannabe\n\u2018bartista\u2019 (bartender-barista), a major sucker for Chinese and Japanese cuisine, a former cocktail waitress\nand a current burger-takeaway prep bunny. I\u2019ll try\neatinganythingatleastonce,though.Oh,andasare-covering depressive, I\u2019m a living example of how food\nmakes/breaks your mood and assists recovery. Yes, I\nhave cheat days and bad student food habits like eve-ryone; yes,I\u2019m still learning!\nI digress. The fact we\u2019re based in cosmopolitan London means we\u2019ve got relatively easy access to all sorts\nof foodie perks: be it a new restaurant,caf\u00e9 or shop to\ndiscover; exciting deals to find, markets to browse, or\nfood festivals to attend. The capital (and TfL) makes\nit easy to swing between a variety of cuisine styles\nfrom all around the world, whether you\u2019re eating it in\nrestaurantsorlookingforingredientstomakeityourself.Indianonenight,Thaianother,Italianafterthat\u2013\nwherever your mood takes you! Also given our nerdy/\ngeeky natures,there\u2019s always a new time/space/mon-ey-savingfoodiehacktodevelopin-betweenproblem\nsets.\nAs it\u2019s the start of the academic year, you might be\npreoccupiedwithallthefreefoodandactivitiesonoffertostartacooking/shoppingroutine,sowe\u2019llletyou\noff the hook this week! Over the year, expect to see\nreader-contributed recipes, Imperialite-tested tips\nand hacks, ingredient/place reviews, serious journalism on food-related happenings (say, advancements\nin stuff like new GM strains, etc.) and features in the\nstyle of The Food Lab on Serious Eats (amongst other\nthings).As with all things food,your mileage and palate may vary, so feel free to take our advice as gospel\ntruth or with a pinch of salt (pun intended).\nIf you\u2019ve got any ideas/recipes to share, a lead on a\ngreat little place to review, or just want an excuse to\nsee me break out some fancy coffee gadgets, drop\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk an email and we\u2019ll take it\nfrom there.\nCAROL ANN CHEAH\nFOOD EDITOR\nYou\u2019ll probably find that in the first\nweek, most of your meals will come\nfrom all the fresher events you\u2019ll be\nattending (hall Chinatown dinners,\npizza nights, etc.), as well as nibbles\nfrom CSP taster sessions. Between all\nthe long \u2018getting to know you\u2019 chats\nyou\u2019ll be having with the cute dude/\ndudette across your hallway and the\nparties you\u2019ll have to hit, there\u2019s not\ngoing to be much time to prep for\ncooked meals (if I had a pound for\neach heart attack my peers had when\nthey checked their bank balances\npost-Freshers\u2019 Week! A fair bit of it\nwasn\u2019t spent on alcohol, mind you).\nFreshers\u2019 Flu does strike a lot\neasier when your immune system\nisn\u2019t bolstered enough with proper\nnutrition, though. So, to prevent the\nFlu putting an early damper on your\nFreshers\u2019 Week celebrations, we\u2019ve\ngot a few quick and dirty suggestions\nfor getting by.\nEat breakfast and smaller\nmeals more regularly\nIt\u2019s the least you can do, even if\nit\u2019s light. Even if it\u2019s just a PB and\nJ sandwich, cereal (bars) or instant\nporridge. Sometimes, in all the\nexcitement, you go for long periods\nwithout eating (and before you know\nit, it\u2019s 3pm and you haven\u2019t lunched/\nit\u2019s been 8-10 hours since your last\nmeal) and not eating breakfast\nextends this wait period. This wreaks\nhavoc on your stomach linings and\nall that jazz in the long run \u2013 no one\nwants to have to contend with severe\npains in the middle of exams. Do\nyourself a favour; your metabolism\nand stomach lining will thank you.\n(Healthy) snacking is your\nfriend\nSort of an elaboration to the tip\nabove: a bag of apples/easy peelers/\nbananas (for the week), or a pot\nof make-your-own-granola (see\nMichelle\u2019s super easy and yummy\nrecipe overleaf) \u2013 something you can\neasily chuck in your bag and bring\nout with you should do the trick.\nMake an event out of it\nCooking for yourself \u2013 by yourself \u2013 is\nalmost always a drag for a fair few. I\nfind that even when I\u2019m the only one\ndoing the prep/cooking for a given\nmeal, I tend to enjoy it more if I\u2019m\ngoing to be sharing the meal with\nsomeone other than myself. If you\nfind yourself staying in one night\nwith a few others because you\u2019re tired\nor there isn\u2019t anything of interest on,\nwhy not club together and try making\nan easy crowd-pleaser recipe with said\nfriends? Pool together equipment and\nmoney for ingredients - it\u2019s a great\nway to break the ice. It\u2019s also a very\ngood excuse to try out certain cuisines\nyou\u2019ve never had the chance to\nsample: I can remember at least two\nexamples of friends from other halls\nhaving me \u201cteach\u201d them the art of\nChinese cuisine/stir-fried veggies and\nrice. Also, things like roast dinners\nmay be overkill if you\u2019re going solo,\nbut make it a group of 4 or even 2 and\nit starts to get more practical. Food\nreally tastes better when it\u2019s shared\n\u2013 try the easy cheesecake recipe\nsubmitted by Rafael for a start.\nDrink up\nYeah, no doubt you\u2019ll be doing just\nthat most nights with all the balls\ngoing on. But in this instance I\u2019m\nreferring to water. It\u2019s very easy to\nforget, especially when the weather\ngets cooler, but being sufficiently\nhydrated will go a long way in\nkeeping your energy levels up (for all\nthe events) and your health in check.\nBargain hunt (with mates)\nYou\u2019ll want to do this with your food\nshop when you finally have time.\nExtreme couponing may only be a\nthing in America, and not being part\nof the NUS means we don\u2019t get certain\nperks...but that Imperial College card\ndoes net you quite a few bargains,\nand some of the local businesses near\nus only offer Imperial-ID-exclusive\nsavings. Try going in twos when food\nshopping as you\u2019ll be able to make use\nof savings on BOGOF (Buy One Get\nOne Free) or similar offers - without\nending up with too much food. We\u2019re\nalso suckers for signing up to Amazon\nLocal and Opentable mailers to\nkeep an eye out for offers on dining\nout \u2013 you can get some ridiculously\ncheap deals on afternoon teas at posh\nLondon hotels, for instance (perfect\nfor impressing the folks on a visit!).\nHere\u2019s a quick-fire list of studenty\nfood and drink related offers to start\nyou guys off (disclaimer: none of\nthese are sponsored):\nWafflemeister:\nWithin sniffing distance of South\nKen station \u2013 closest to actual Belgian\nwaffles that you can get without a\nhall-organized Bruges trip. Founded\nby an Imperial Business School alum-nus! 15% off when you present your\nCollege ID.\nPact Coffee:\nSubscription specialty coffee service,\ndelivers weekly/fortnightly (longer\nintervals available upon request). Free\nnext day delivery, sent within a week\nof roasting, pre-ground (for your brew\nmethod of choice, if you don\u2019t grind\nyour own) moments before sending.\nSuper-fresh and no-quibble refund\npolicy for any dodgy bags that weren\u2019t\nyour cup of tea(!) First bag only \u00a31\nwith coupon code IMPERIALCOLLEGEVIP at pactcoffee.com.\nSnog:\nCasual date/snack place, or just\ngo there and giggle at the cheesy\npunnery. Free upgrade to a \u2018Classic\u2019\nsized Snog if you purchase a \u2018Little\u2019\nbetween 12 and 3pm. Vice-worthy\ntoppings of choice include chocolate\nbrownies and strawberries.\nKrispy Kreme:\nGet a free original glazed donut/\ndoughnut when you sign up to their\nFriends of Krispy Kreme newsletter.\nBag even more for free when you get\nyour friends to do the same via your\nreferral link (provided at the end of\nyour sign-up process.)\nmySuperList:\nProvided by the savvy folks at my-Supermarket. Not an offer, strictly\nspeaking, but key in your shopping\nlist into the free app and it\u2019ll compare\nyour total shop across supermarkets,\nhighlight new offers/cashback etc.\nEasy Peasy Cheesecake Recipe\nEverybody loves a cheesecake. Rafael T. S\u00e1nchez has a great recipe.\n\"Perfect\n'procrasti-baking'\nproject for\nlazy week-ends; best\ndone with\nthat cutie\ndown the\ncorridor\nfrom you.\"\nFelix Food says: \u201cWe were actually\ndeliriously happy when we saw Rafa\u2019s\npics of this cake, both in mini and\nsharing versions. They look pretty\nand yummy enough to be a crowd-pleaser, yet aren\u2019t so ridiculously\ncomplex that they\u2019ll discourage\nfirst-time student bakers with long\ncooking times or tough methods\nand of course, the proof is in the\npudding\u2019s taste.\nFeel free to experiment with scaling\nbatch sizes, changing flavorings/\nfruits, or using unique cake tins/\nmolds. Perfect \u201cprocrastibaking\u201d\nproject for lazy weekends; best done\nwith that cutie down the corridor\nfrom you.\u201d\nIngredients:\n\u2022 200g plain digestive biscuits (any\nbrand, no chocolate/caramel/\nanything)\n\u2022 225g sugar, plus 40g for base\n(approx. 3 tbsp)\n\u2022 80g unsalted butter\n\u2022 900g Philadelphia Cream Cheese\n(or any other plain cream cheese)\n\u2022 4 eggs (medium to large)\n\u2022 1tbsp lemon juice (substitute\nwith 1tsp vanilla extract if you\ndon\u2019t like lemon)\nOptional topping:\n\u2022 500g strawberries (or other fruits\nand berries)\n\u2022 25g sugar (around 2 tbsp)\nMethod:\nBase:\nPreheat the oven to 160\u00b0C. Carefully\nplace the biscuits inside a ziploc\nbag, seal well and crush them with a\nrolling pin/kitchen hammer/bottom\nof a pan until they are evenly reduced\nto fine crumbs.\nMelt the butter, add 40 grams of\nsugar and thoroughly mix with the\nbiscuit crumbs. Press mixture onto\nthe bottom of a cake tin* to form the\nbiscuit base. Cool in the fridge for 40\nminutes.\nMix the cream cheese with 225\ngrams of sugar and the lemon juice.\nThen slowly add in the eggs, one at a\ntime, until the mixture is even. Pour\nit over the cooled crust.\nPlace in a preheated oven and bake\nfor 50 minutes, or until the surface is\nset and no longer soft.\nOnce cooled, put in the fridge for 3\nto 4 hours. It\u2019s all ready to eat!\nTopping:\nSave a third of the nicer-looking\nstrawberries to decorate the top. Hull\n(remove the green bit) and chop the\nrest of the strawberries, then blend\nwith 25 grams of sugar and a large\nspoonful of water.\nSieve the blend and pour it over\nthe cheesecake. Slice the remaining\nstrawberries and decorate the cake!\nIf you're feeling fancy:\nYou can make individual cheesecakes!\nJust follow the same recipe - but use\nlittle glass ramekins instead of a big\ncake tin (you can recycle the ramekins\nwhen you buy puddings like G\u00fc pots\nin the supermarket.)\n*If you don\u2019t have a cake tin, you\ncan use two disposable aluminium\nbaking pans. Split the crumbs and the\nmixture in two, putting one half in\neach pan \u2013 instead of one traditional\ncheesecake you\u2019ll get two much\nlighter cakes.\nDo watch out, they cook much\nfaster this way!\nHomemade snacking granola\nMICHELLE TAN\nFOOD WRITER\nMich is a sucker for balanced eating on\na budget, scouting for healthy-eating\ncafes and wandering around supermarket\naisles/market stalls to relax. This\nrecipe also leaves plenty of room for\ncustomization - you can add your favorite\nfruit/nuts, include dark chocolate pieces,\nadjust sugar content to suit your palate,\netc (I for one tend to leave my raisins/\nsultanas whole instead of chopped.)\nIt provides a sustained energy source\nthat beats the sugar crashes you get from\nother snacks - perfect for keeping up\nyour concentration during long hours in\nthe lecture hall. And of course, making\na huge batch works out cheaper without\nall the nasty extras in most shop-bought\ngranola.\nMakes 2 cups:\n\u2022 3 tablespoons packed light\nbrown sugar\n\u2022 3 cups rolled oats (not instant)\n\u2022 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n\u2022 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n\u2022 1/3 cup honey\n\u2022 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\u2022 1/2 cup finely diced dried fruit\n\u2022 1/2 cup coarsely chopped nuts or\nseeds (either raw or toasted)\nHeat the oven to 150\u00b0C and place\na rack in the centre. Place the oats,\nbrown sugar, cinnamon, and salt in\na large bowl and stir to combine; set\naside. Combine honey, oil, and vanilla\nin a small bowl and stir well. Pour\nover the oat mixture and mix until\nthe oats are thoroughly coated.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment\nand tip out the granola mixture.\nSpread into a donut shape to ensure\nthat all the oats bake evenly.\nPlace in centre of oven on prepared\nrack and bake for 15 minutes, and\nthen rotate the tray. Continue baking\nuntil the granola is very light golden\nbrown (takes anywhere from 5-15\nminutes)\nPlace the baking sheet on a wire\nrack and cool the granola to room\ntemperature. Once thoroughly cool,\nbreak into small pieces. Store in an\nairtight container for up to 2 weeks.\nServe with yogurt and fresh fruit for\na scrummy treat at breakfast, or as a\nsnack in-between meals.\nProtip: \u201cI\u2019ve found that buying\noats, nuts and seeds in bulk is the\ncheapest option - you can find all the\ningredients at the huge Whole Foods\nMarket on High Street Kensington.\nAt times when work gets me down,\nI find it therapeutic to just meander\nthe supermarket aisles, forgetting\nabout the mountain of work I have\nto complete by tomorrow. There\u2019s a\nsense of satisfaction to be felt when\nI manage to walk out with 5 pounds\nworth of nuts, seeds, grains and pulses\nready to make some fine dish for the\nnight\u2019s dinner - or a fresh batch of\ngranola for tomorrow\u2019s breakfast.\u201d\nCheaper alternatives: If you\u2019re\nconcerned about the price, you\u2019ll still\nbe able to find everything else in your\nusual local supermarkets. You won\u2019t\nbe able to bulk buy like in WFM, but\nit\u2019s great for experimenting in smaller\nbatches.\n\n"

I do my research and\nmy teaching, but how can I make\nsomeone else feel like that when\nthey\u2019re here? I want to make other\npeople want to come here.\nI went to Sussex, having missed\nmy offer to Bristol. This was pretty\nlucky, as Harry Kroto [discoverer\nof Buckminsterfullerene] was\nmy Physical Chemistry tutor. I\nremember the first time that he\ncame in and told me: \u201cit\u2019s a football\u201d.\nLooking back now, that was a real\n\u2018blow your mind moment\u2019.\nI\u2019m an inorganic chemist by\ntraining. I\u2019ve been at Imperial for\nquite a while now. When I started\nthere hadn\u2019t been a job for an\ninorganic chemist advertised in the\ncountry in years, then all of a sudden\nall the top departments advertised\nwithin a couple of weeks of each\nother. The first one that I went\nto interview at was Durham, and\nbefore the interview one of the other\ncandidates asked me where I would\ngo if I could to do any of the top four\nChemistry departments in the UK.\nRather cheekily, I said Imperial! I\nguess that\u2019s why I want to be Dean,\nbecause I cared even before I started\nhere.\nBF: So what are your big ideas for\nthe faculty?\nTW: Well to start, let me just say\nthat we\u2019re not broken \u2013 what we\u2019d be\ndoing is guilding the lily, working\nupon something that\u2019s already highly\nsuccessful. We want to promote\nopenness and inclusion.\nI also want to remind people that\na career in science isn\u2019t a golden\nconveyor belt \u2013 I didn\u2019t go to my first\nchoice university, and I didn\u2019t get a\nfirst class degree, or make the initial\nprobation. Fundamentally I think\nthat people need to be reminded that\nthose of us doing science aren\u2019t the\nbrightest and the top of our class with\na completely omnipotent personality,\nwe\u2019re human too. We struggle when\nwe need to and find it easy when we\nneed to. Sometimes I think that as an\ninstitution that doesn\u2019t come across.\nI\u2019d also like to change the culture\nto be a little more welcoming. If I see\nsomeone in welcome week trying to\nfind a building named after a dead\nperson, I always try to give them a\nhand. That doesn\u2019t always happen, but\nwe should try and maybe be a little\nless competitive. Hopefully Imperial\nwill be a little more welcoming, a\nlittle bit better tomorrow than it was\nyesterday.\nBF: So that quite clearly links to\nstudent involvement, what would\nyou change that students would\nwant to see improved, for example\nmental health support?\nTW: Well this is a difficult one.\nI think that the college\u2019s crisis\nmanagement support services are\nfantastic, but the problems come\nbefore that stage. We need a mutually\nsupportive environment, where the\nlittle things matter. You\u2019re never too\nbusy to be nice to someone!\nIt\u2019s weird really. I\u2019m always happy,\nbut I came from a generation\nthat listened to the Smiths and\nthought that misery and intellect\nwere synonymous, whilst negative\nemotions were the only profound\nones. I think that we need to make\nsure that we challenge these ideas,\nsome of which still persist today. A\nlot of the time the assumption is that\nbecause I\u2019m happy I must be thick \u2013 it\njust doesn\u2019t work like that!\nBF: So if you ever got a student\nknocking on your door as Dean,\nyou wouldn't turn them away?\nTW: God no! I never mind being\nstopped by students.\nBF: Hmm. So, what do you think\nof Imperial West and Acton?\nTW: What a fantastic opportunity!\nWhen it stops being a concept and\nstarts being a thing, it\u2019ll be brilliant.\nWith regard to Acton, I understand\nwhy students are a little weary. What\nhappens there depends on lots of\nthings, and whilst it might feel now\nlike a bit of a bum deal, buildings last\na long time! They grow, and maybe in\nthe future they\u2019ll seem better.\n\"I also want\nto remind\npeople that\na career\nin science\nisn't a\ngolden\nconveyor\nbelt.\"\n\"With\nregard to\nActon, I\nunderstand\nwhy\nstudents\nare a little\nweary.\"\n\n"

These sessions are given\nby experienced researchers and\nprofessional engineers, to help you\nacquire the tools to finance, plan and\ndeliver a successful overseas project.\nWe want to see a world without\npoverty and without barriers to\nhuman development \u2013 where\neveryone can meet their basic needs,\ncan live in dignity, can create and\ncan flourish. No matter your area of\nexpertise or your career plan, you can\ncontribute to building a sustainable\nand fair future for others.\nMarcus Bishop discusses the opportunities for EWB volunteers\nEngineers Without Borders UK\nMany people in our world face severe\nchallenges even just to live. Engineers\nWithout Borders UK is a charitable\norganisation that believes that access\nto engineering and technical knowhow can help overcome many of these\nchallenges.\nOur work aims to demonstrate\nthe link between engineering and\nhumanity, a connection which is\noften neglected in our education and\nin practice.\nEWB Imperial, a branch of EWB\nUK, is a well-established society\nproviding opportunities for Imperial\nstudents, local school children and\nour international partners. We are\na gathering of environmentally and\nsocially conscious engineers and non-engineers, engaging in meaningful\nprojects which create Massive Small\nChange both locally and abroad. The\nmission is simply to empower human\ndevelopment through engineering.\nEWB members have established\nmany successful projects, most\nnotably Raincatcher Imperial \u2013 a\ngroup focussing on water provision\nfor poor communities in Tanzania,\nand now a charity in its own right.\nIn London, EWB Imperial Outreach\nworks with local school groups to\nhelp inspire the next generation\nof engineers through hands-on\nworkshops designed and delivered\nby Outreach volunteers. This year\nwe hope to double the number of\nopportunities to local students,\nfocussing particularly on engaging\nchildren from disadvantaged\nbackgrounds. Volunteers involved\nin Outreach find it a rewarding\nexperience, and a platform for\nenhancing group management and\nevent planning abilities.\nIn September 2013, EWB Imperial\nembarked on an International\nPartnership with SIBAT, an\nalternative technology charity in the\nPhilippines. A research trip to three\nisolated rainforest villages in the\nNorth of the country exposed a rare\ninsight into the difficult lives of the\nNabuangan people.\nEWB is now connecting\nengineering talent at Imperial to\nthe daily problems faced by many\nliving in rural Philippines, and just 12\nmonths, on a shoestring budget, our\ndesign team has developed a system\nfor managing power in Nabuangan\nHydropower schemes.\nThe next phase is to further\nimprove the technology to ensure\nthat it can survive in the humid\nrainforest climate, before installing\nthe system during Summer 2015.\nThe design team is open to\nenthusiastic and motivated students\nfrom all disciplines, and offers a\nunique chance to contribute from\ndrawing board through to application\nin the field.\nOur thoughts go out to the\nthousands in the main Island of\nLuzon, who have recently weathered\nTyphoon Kalmaegi. The severity and\nfrequency of Typhoons hitting the\nPhilippines has been trending up\nin the last decade, and the repeated\ndevastation to the poorest in society\nis a serious concern for the future.\nEWB is incubating many alternative\ntechnology projects related to\ntyphoon survival systems, ready for\nmulti-disciplinary teams to explore\nthe problems faced on a local scale,\nand engineer innovative, low cost\nsolutions.\nThe challenges faced during\nInternational Development projects\nare quite different from any you\nmight experience on your course.\nOne must observe, interact and\nconsult with all the local stakeholders\nto gain a complete understanding of\nthe barriers to development. Many\nengineers are able to work through\nthe technical aspects of a project,\nbut only a handful have the range\nof skills necessary to overcome\nlinguistic, political and practical\nobstacles and create positive change.\nEWB Imperial is runing a series\nof scenario-based workshops called\nTackling global challenges with e.quinox\nIt is not often that one has the\nopportunity to actually feel like you\nare making a difference. Too often\ninstead the vast nature of global\nchallenges seems to nullify our\nefforts. Nevertheless, for ten Imperial\nCollege students this summer having\na role in combating poverty seemed\nlike a very vivid reality. Rather than\nlooking for the ever sought after\nsummer internship, these students\ndecided to head off to Rwanda.\nTogether with the rest of the e.quinox\nteam, they are trying to bring cheap\nelectricity to rural communities\nacross the world.\nA lack of electricity might not\nseem like a problem for a family\nearning less than \u00a31 a day, but this is\na common misconception. Access to\naffordable electricity has been shown\nto have a positive impact on health,\neducation, and is a primary necessity\nfor local business to flourish. These\nfamilies spend a significant amount\nof their earnings on kerosene, candles\nand phone recharges. Kerosene in\nparticular is expensive, polluting,\nunsafe and unhealthy. A clean\nelectrical light source allows families\nto safely study or work even after the\nsun has set.\nTo this date, e.quinox\u2019s focus\nhas been to provide access to clean\nlighting. This summer for the first\ntime the feasibility of a larger scale\nproject is being tested. Building on\nthe hydroelectric plant constructed\nin the summer of 2012, the team is\nassessing the possibility of building\na micro-grid in a nearby village.\nThe idea is to combine the power\ngenerated by the hydro plant with\nsolar home systems (SHS), which\nuse solar panels and batteries to\ngenerate and store electricity. This\nwould allow connected customers to\nbe both consumers and producers of\nelectricity. If successful, this would\nbe the first example of a micro-grid,\nwhich grows in size and stability as\nmore customers join it.\nIn order to do so, the team in\nRwanda is now surveying a possible\nroute for the transmission line,\ncarrying out geotechnical and\nstructural investigations, and\ncollecting data on the business case\nfor it.\nAlthough the information collected\nthis summer is key, crucial work for\nthe success of the project will be done\nduring term time in London. The\ncurrent turbine design needs to be\nimproved and then manufactured.\nThe business model still needs to be\nfinalised using the data collected.\nFurthermore, using the estimated\nenergy consumption, a suitable SHS\nneeds to be designed and tested to\nensure the stability of this micro-grid.\ne.quinox has always been a\nchampion of development through\nlocal entrepreneurship. Aid\ncreates dependency, whereas a\nbusiness generates profits for the\nlocal community and aims to the\nempower those within it.\n\"Too often\nthe vast\nnature\nof global\nchallenges\nseems to\nnullify our\nefforts.\"\n\"If\nsuccessful,\nthis would\nbe the first\nexample of\na micro-grid.\"\nVISHESH PUSTAKE\nWRITER\nNabuangan Valley, Luzon, Philippines.

Photo: Engineers Without Borders\nexcel, and thus the degrees offered by\nImperial College, especially science,\nengineering or mathematics, are\nexcellent preparation for the rigors of\nthe legal profession.\nBeyond the transferable skills,\nhowever, these degrees are extremely\nrelevant to their related practice\nareas in law. For instance, a science\ndegree is valuable in deciphering the\ntechnical terms in a pharmaceutical\npatent in intellectual property law,\nand mathematical skills will give\nyou an edge in tax and accounting\nlaw. Graham Forrest, a life sciences\nPhD graduate from Imperial College,\nnow working as a patent attorney,\nrecapitulates this, saying that law\nis \u201cjust as intellectually stimulating\nas academia, but offers better job\nsecurity and potential for career\nprogression\u201d.\nSo what are the routes to becoming\na solicitor or barrister? Firstly, you\nYes, it's true! As a lawyer you can be this fabulous... we think?. Photo: fanpop.com\nAlexander Beaghton discusses how you too could be a lawyer\nAttention Imperial College students:\nyou could become a lawyer. This may\nsound like a strange thing to say at a\nUniversity that does not offer a law\ndegree, but did you know that almost\nhalf of the new lawyers in the UK did\nnot read law as undergraduates? If\nyou are studying science, engineering\nor mathematics, you may be in a\nprime position to exploit a niche in\nthe legal market. You could end up\nworking in the City with a salary\nsimilar to investment banking, or\nadvising clients on the forefront of\nnew technologies and discoveries,\nwhere your expertise and analytical\nskills gained at Imperial lend you a\ntactical advantage.\nIt is no secret that banking and\nfinance are still highly popular\noptions for Imperial graduates,\nregardless of the recession. In 2011,\nover a quarter of physics graduates\nfrom Imperial College were recruited\ninto the financial profession.\nYet in an increasingly regulated\nbanking environment, where bonuses\nare slashed and the freedom to trade\nis slowly being suffocated, the work\n\u2013 and the recognition \u2013 is shifting to\nthe City lawyers. While banking is\nbecoming increasingly saturated with\nSTEM graduates, lawyers with science\nand engineering backgrounds are still\nthe exception rather than the rule.\nYou may be wondering how you\ncan possibly transfer to law from a\nscience, engineering, or mathematics\ndegree. Yet regardless of what stage\nyou are at in your degree, there is\na clear and defined path for you\nto enter into the legal profession.\nIn fact, Lord Sumption, Justice of\nthe Supreme Court in the UK, has\nsaid that \u201cthe study of a subject\nwhich comes close to pure logic, like\nmathematics, is at least as valuable a\npreparation for legal practice as the\nstudy of law\u201d.\nAs standard undergraduate law\ndegrees are increasingly less of a\nrequirement for law firms, graduate\nrecruiters are actively searching for\ngraduates with non-legal degrees that\nwill offer different transferable skills.\nMany top intellectual property and\nlife sciences firms, such as Bristows\nLLP or Bird & Bird LLP, already\nspecifically target Imperial College\ngraduates and even postgraduates,\nmeaning that studying at Imperial\ngives you a strong head start.\nIt is common knowledge that\nthe work of a solicitor or barrister\ninvolves handling large amounts of\ninformation, interpreting complex\nlegislation and drafting intricate\ndocuments. As a result, logical minds\nwill have to take the GDL (Graduate\nDiploma in Law) following your\nundergraduate degree, which\nwill bring you up to par with law\ngraduates. This is followed with\nanother year of more specialized\nstudy, either branching into the LPC\n(Legal Practice Course) to become a\nsolicitor or into the Bar Professional\nTraining Course to become a\nbarrister.\nTo receive your law degree, these\ntwo years of law education are\nfollowed by training at a law firm or\nbarrister\u2019s chambers. Though it is not\nparticularly difficult to gain places\non the law courses, being accepted\nfor a training contract (solicitor)\nor a pupillage (barrister) is a highly\ncompetitive process. For non-law\nstudents, applications to training\ncontracts can be submitted on the\nfinal year of your undergraduate\ndegree. If you are successful, both\nLaw: is this the career for you?\nyears of law school are subsidized at\nmany top firms, sometimes with an\nadditional hefty maintenance grant.\nThe application process may be\ntough, but thankfully Imperial\nCollege has its own dedicated Law\nSociety, committed to helping\nundergraduates through every\nstage of the journey towards a legal\ncareer. The committee members are\non campus to help students from\nan initial interest in a legal career\nto the ins and outs of building CVs\nand applications. Most importantly,\nthe law society is part of a network\nconsisting of both top City firms\nand the diversity-focused group\nAspiring Solicitors, all of which are\nhosting events either at the College\nor their offices. These events will be\nopportunities for undergraduates to\nlearn about life as a lawyer, ask any\nquestions and get vital application\nadvice from graduate recruiters and\nlegal trainees themselves.\n\"It is no\nsecret that\nbanking\nand\nfinance are\nstill highly\npopular\noptions for\nImperial\ngraduates.\"\n\"There is a\nclear and\ndefined\npath for\nyou to\nenter into\nthe legal\nprofession\"\n\n"

Photo: Bilbo Baggins\nWorld of Warcraft:\nWarlords of Draenor\nRelease Date: 13.11.14\nPlatform: PC and Mac\nIn recent times the king of MMOs\nhas been losing strength. After a\ndrop to 7 million subscribers as of\nAugust from an all-time high of\n12 million a few years back, lots\nof talk is abound that the end of\nthe world (of warcraft) is nigh. To\nstem the flow Activision have now\nannounced an ambitious update that\nwill be available in about a month.\nFollowing on from the story of the\nMists of Pandaria, we have a story\nthat includes time-travel, returning\nof legendary Warcraft characters\nand generally a lot of promise.\nFurthermore, there will be ,among\nmany others, implementations of\nPlayer-built garrisons, changed PvP\nand the almost mandatory raise in\nthe max level. All in all it looks quite\npromising, and if you have been\ncontemplating returning to WoW,\nnow may be the time. Just be careful\nthat you remember to have a life\noutside Azeroth.\nCall of Duty: Advanced\nWarfare\nRelease Date: 4.11.14\nPlatform: PC, XOne, PS4, Xbox 360,\nPS3\nCall of Duty is a franchise that is\nridiculed for its seeming simplicity,\nlack of originality and immaturity of\nits audience. Quick summary: it is a\nsimplistic shooter, where you have no\nreal strategy or team play (am I being\nslightly biased?). Yet, on an annual\nbasis millions go out, queue for hours\nand spend hard-earned cash on the\nnewest instalment. Now on the 4th\nof November this event is rolling\naround for another year. This time\nhowever, we will see some changes\nthat might make this game worth a\ngo. A redesigned HUD and supposed\nchange to the gun mechanics, as\nwell as genuine plot setting seem to\nsuggest that Activision are realising\nthey can\u2019t keep pushing the same\nthing (albeit adding dogs) onto us and\nexpect us to buy it.\nPok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and\nAlpha Sapphire\nRelease Date: 28.11.14\nPlatform: 3DS\nAfter the recent relative success\nof Pok\u00e9mon X and Y, the gamer\ncommunity was quite surprised that\nwe would get another Pok\u00e9mon game\nin the same year! Not only that, but\nthese two games are remakes of Ruby\nand Sapphire, a set of games that\nfans have been waiting for for This\nis a game that Pok\u00e9mon fans have\nbeen waiting for roughly three years\nnow. In fact there was even a meme:\n\u201cHoenn confirmed\u201d. Marrying the\nstory and characters of the original\nwith the mechanics, like the 3-D\nview for example, that made X and Y\nshould make for a very good game.\nIn fact this Editor, who has so far\nresisted the need to buy a 3DS might\nbuy himself one, along with a copy of\nAlpha Sapphire for nostalgia\u2019s sake!\nFar Cry 4\nRelease Date: 18.11.14\nPlatform: PC, XOne, PS4, Xbox 360,\nPS3\nAfter the commercial and critical\nsuccess that was Far Cry 3, which had\na great set of characters, game play\nand a beautiful open world, Ubisoft\nis now releasing the next instalment\nin the Far Cry series. This FPS, which\nusually is marked by beautiful maps,\ngreat game play and interesting\nstories is set in the Himalayas,\npromises to deliver the things we\nhave come to expect from this series.\nThese include a gorgeous open\nworld, a large dynamic way of doing\nyour missions and great characters.\nGenerally these games always deliver,\nso I think this game should be a safe\nbet if you are looking for a geeat\ngaming experience.\nLord of the Rings: Shadow of\nMordor\nRelease Date: 30.9.14(PC), 10.3.14\n(XOne, PS4), 21.11.14 (Xbox 360, PS3)\nPlatform: PC, XOne, PS4, Xbox 360,\nPS3\nA game, that I am personally\nextremely excited for, the shadow\nof Mordor is the newest Lord of the\nRings game to be released. A action-RPG looking like a combination\nof Skyrim and Assassin\u2019s creed, we\nonce again enter the world of Middle\nEarth, but this time not with any\nof the established characters from\nTolkien\u2019s imagination, but indeed\na entirely new protagonist, Talion,\nand a new story. Utilizing all of the\nrich lore that makes LotR, including\nstealth, magic and action and\nintroducing entirely new mechanics,\nthis game could be an absolute\nwinner. If you are any kind of LoTR\nfan, you should seriously consider\nbuying this game.\nAssassins Creed Unity &\nRogue\nRelease Date: 13.11.14\nPlatform: PC, XOne, PS4 (Unity),\nXbox 360, PS3 (Rogue)\nYes you read correctly, we are going\nto have two Assassin\u2019s Creed games\nreleased on the same day. One allows\nyou to play as a Templar, hunting\nAssassin, focusing heavily on naval\nwarfare and serves to fill the gaps in\nthe story between Assassin\u2019s Creed 3\nand Black Flag. Unity, on the other\nhand, features a completely new\nassassins and is set in Paris on the\neve of the French revolution. Both\nof these titles look amazing, and\nthe updates to the game-play and\nmultiplayer add on an already great\nset of games. The only problem is that\nUnity is only available for the new\ngeneration of consoles as well as PC,\nwhile Rogue only is available for the\nPS3 and Xbox 360. This means that\nunless you own both generations, you\nwill only be able to play one.\nAlien: Isolation\nRelease Date: 7.10.2014\nPlatform: PC, XOne, PS4, Xbox 360,\nPS3\nThe soonest game on our list,\nAlien: Isolation plans to restore the\nfranchise to its high pedestal after\nthe abysmal game that was Colonial\nmarines. Instead of going for the\nFPS, the newest Alien game is now a\nhorror-survival game which follows a\nrecent trend of these games. However,\nunlike these other games, this game\nhas a rich backstory to draw upon,\nwhich it does masterfully. You are\nthe lonely Amanda Ripley, who is\ninvestigating the disappearance of her\nmother. Throughout your quest for\nknowledge, you are being stalked by\na single incredibly scary xenomorph\nagainst which you have limited\nability to fight. This game looks super\ngood and scary, (just watch youtube\nvideos with people wearing the oculus\nrift) and if you are fan of the stealth-horror-survival genre, genuinely a\ntitle to look at.\nSid Meier's Civilization:\nBeyond Earth\nRelease Date: 24.10.2014\nPlatform: PC, Mac and Linux\nThe Civ series is undoubtably\nthe king of strategy games. Using\nthe tried and tested method of\nmost 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit,\neXterminate) titles these games\njust have a special place in strategy\nenthusiasts hearts. Now with the\nnewest Civ game: Beyond Earth, we\nhave something that is completely\ndifferent from any previous Civ\nGames. Still retaining the basic game\nmechanics, we are now trying to take\nof the universe instead of only earth.\nFurthermore, instead of relying on\nhistoric civilizations, we now have the\nability to create our own civilizations\nof the future. Even though the price\nmay seem somewhat steep, (you can\nalways wait for a steam sale!) it is\nsomething to get excited for.\n\n"

Photo: Thomas Lim\nUnion media facilities revamp finally\ncompleted\nOn Tuesday after a year of\nconsultation, designing and\nconstruction, Imperial College Union\nfinally unveiled their new state-of-the-art Media Centre housed in the\nWest Basement of Beit Quadrangle.\nAfter College announced plans to\nconvert the East Basement into new\naffordable bedrooms precipitating a\nneed to new storage facilities for club\nequipment, a joint project between\nCollege and the Union was launched\nto upgrade the aging facilities of\nthe media centre and provide much\nneeded storage.\nThe old Media Centre was built in\n2001 and installed by students, but\nwith the recent industry wide move to\ndigital equipment, the aging analogue\nequipment was beginning to show\nits age. In the past, these facilities\nhave helped many students take the\nfirst steps in a career in this industry.\nTo ensure that the Union continues\nto offer students state-of-the-art\nequipment and applicable techniques\nto that in commercial facilities,\nthe redevelopment has led to a live\ntelevision, radio, recording and\nrehearsal studios, professional-grade\ndarkroom, postproduction facilities,\nand a new production office for Felix\nto be built.\nWhile smaller than the Media\nCentre which it replaces, the\nnew facilities are kitted out to a\nmuch higher specification, with\nthe College spending close to\n\u00a3100,000 on equipment, including:\na 32-channel ProTools recording\nsystem; 4K-compatible live television\nbroadcast equipment handling up to\n12 cameras; an acoustically-treated\npostproduction studio with a 5.1\nreference-grade surround-sound\nsystem; and 4K editing suite. With\nshared offices and studios, the\nMedia Centre is much more flexible,\npromoting inter-societies activities.\nAs part of the project the dedicated\n24/7 radio broadcast studio has been\nequipped with a Studer digital system\nlinked into the rest of the broadcast\nfacilities. The Media societies have\nbeen given a much-needed computer\nupgrade, with an all-new set of 27\u201d\niMacs and Creative Cloud.\nJust a stone\u2019s throw away from the\nMetric and FiveSixEight, this facility\ncan record and broadcast live plays,\nconcerts, and shows from either of\nthese spaces, as well as being able to\nedit and produce events recorded\naround campus and further afield.\nThis allows students to put on\nproductions on a scale unrivalled by\nalmost any completely student-run\nfacility in the country.\nThe Media Centre is not without\ncontroversy, though. Philippa Skett,\nEditor-in-Chief of Felix, has allegedly\nbeen involved in a longstanding\ndispute with a senior member of the\nUnion management team regarding\na semicircular desk. When asked for\ncomment, she did not reply directly\nto the allegations; instead responding\nwith a disgruntled \u201cMy office is\nsmaller than it used to be, but at least\nwe have natural light I guess.\u201d\nThe Media Centre is open for any\nstudents or members of the Union\nto use with the individual rooms\nmanaged by student societies. The\nMedia groups that make use of the\nbasement are IC Radio \u2013 who operate\nthe 24/7 internet radio station; ICTV\n\u2013 who produce television and short\nfilms; Jazz and Rock Society \u2013 who\nmanage the rehearsal studio with a\ndrum kit, keyboards, and guitar and\nbass amplifiers; and PhotoSoc \u2013 who\nloan out photographic equipment\nand provide darkroom facilities for\ndeveloping film.\nAlso located in the West Basement\nare LeoSoc, who have an arts studio\nand run regular classes, and the\nScience Fiction Society who curate the\nsecond largest science fiction library\nin the World (after MIT).Tours of\nthe new basement will be ran during\nFreshers\u2019 fair.\nMAX HUNTER\nELLEN MATHIENSON\nSTEPHEN BALL\nNEWS WRITERS\nViewers of Downton Abbey were\ntreated to a fire at the stately home\nin the first episode of the new series\nshown on Sunday 21 September. As\npart of the rescue operation, Jezebel,\nthe Royal College of Science Union\u2019s\nfire engine mascot, made a surprise\nappearance on screen as the fire\nbrigade start leaving for home!\nLast year\u2019s RCS Motor Club\nCaptain, Stephen Ball, as well as\nMotor Club/Imperial College\nalumnus John James also appeared\nas extras alongside the fire engine.\nJezebel was \u2018head hunted\u2019 by a\ncompany specialising in finding\nvehicles for films and broadcast,\nafter they had seen her on the annual\nLondon to Brighton Run.\nDownton Abbey is set in Yorkshire\n(but filmed in Berkshire), hence the\n\u2018London Fire Brigade\u2019 gilding on the\nside of the vehicle would be somewhat\nout of place. Thanks to the work of\nexperts employed by the filming\ncompany, vinyl stickers covering the\ngilding transformed Jezebel into a\nfire engine owned by the \u2018Downton\nFire Brigade\u2019 for the duration of\nthe filming without damaging the\npaintwork underneath.\nThe five minutes of film took two\nevenings to record on set at Highclere\nCastle, although the fire scenes\nthemselves were recorded in a studio\nto avoid damage to the Grade I listed\nproperty.\nStephen described some of his\nexperiences from being in the\nprogramme to Felix: \u201cI had tea made\nfor me by Kevin Doyle (Mr Molesley),\nand chatted with Thomas and James\n(Rob James-Collier and Ed Speleers)\nin the house's library during one of\nbreaks.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cthe two boys who\nplay George Crawley loved sitting in\nJezebel's cab.\u201d Asked whether he could\nforesee a future in being an extra, he\nreplied \u201cthe food was good, but I don't\nthink I could be an extra full time.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t Jezebel\u2019s first television\nappearance. In 1982, Jez appeared\non the BBC\u2019s Blue Peter before\ntravelling off to Germany for a\ncarnival. In 1966, The Jokers, a film\nby Michael Winner, also stared the\nfamous vehicle. A video of the film\nappearance is available on YouTube.\nStephen also noted that RCS Motor\nClub would \u201clove to get her back\non the screen,\u201d and that \u201cthere has\nalready been discussion [\u2026] about\ngetting Clementine [the RSM's truck\nmascot] into a series sometime soon.\u201d\nThe entire first episode of the\nnew series of Downton Abbey can\nbe watched on ITV Player online\nuntil around the end of October.\nRCS Motor Club will be giving rides\nat Fresher's Fair and doing tours of\nLondon in the first weeks of term\nshould anyone wish to meet the\nfamous star.\nDEPUTY EDITOR\nPHILIP KENT\nRCSU Mascot Jezebel stars in Downton Abbey\n\n"

Max Eggl tells you whats hot\nMy thoughts on the\nnewest Apple Keynote\nMAX EGGL\nTECH EDITOR\nTo be honest, there isn\u2019t one emotion I can consign to\nthelatestApplekeynote.Thereweregoodparts,there\nwere bad parts and there were meh parts. Sadly the\nmeh parts much outweighed the good parts. Above/\nBelow you can see a review of the newest iPhone so I\nshan\u2019t bore you with that or in fact any of the feature-heavy details, I mean there are several thousand\narticles that describe that which you can browse at\nyour leisure.\nGenerally what Apple released this year seems to\nbe what the public have been craving for years now.\nA larger screen iPhone, check. A phablet, check. NFC,\ncheck. An iWatch (actually named the AppleWatch),\ncheck. Now rather than defining a category Apple\nseems to always come late to ones created by other\ncompanies, and even then doesn\u2019t really do anything\nthat amazing. The specs of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus\nare not extraordinary in any way, and while the\nWatch does have this innovative new digital crown\n(which honestly I feel is incredibly overhyped), it still\ndoesn\u2019tseemlikesomethingImustbuy.Itdoesn\u2019tadd\nanything new to my life (apart from the messaging,\nwhich seemed quite useful) and for more than \u00a3300,\nsomething I frankly I don\u2019t want to spend that kind\nof money on, especially when we consider that Apple\nhasn\u2019t even mentioned how short battery life will be.\nSointermsofactualproductsreleased,theonlyone\nthat really interests me is ApplePay. It looks simple\nand really useful, utilising the TouchID sensor seems\nlikeatoolIdefinitelywoulduse.However,guesswhat,\nitsonlyavailableintheUS.Bummer.Sounlessyouare\ncurrently an inhabitant of the United States, you will\nbe unable to use ApplePay. Furthermore we aren\u2019t\neven given a date when this feature will be available\nto the rest of the world.\nWhile I definitely believe that ApplePay while\nfinally get mobile payments off the ground, the fact\nthat it only available in one country in the world\ndefinitely doesn\u2019t help.\nTheonethingthatreallydidstrikemeatthekeynote\nwas not actually any announcement or product, but\nan action. When the AppleWatch video finished, Tim\nCook stood in front of the audience, wearing one of\nhis new products, basking in a standing ovation from\nthe journalists. A standing ovation. I mean, was I the\nonly one who thought this was slightly cringy? This\nproduct, while cool, was certainly not deserving of a\nstanding ovation especially when we knew nothing\naboutityet.Ifithadaweeksbattery,amoreappealing\ndesign,the ability to tap-dance and crap money,then\nmaybe it would have deserved a standing ovation.\nWhat this showed to me,is the lowered expectation\nwe have now come to expect from Apple. We do not\nexpect groundbreaking innovation, in fact we are\nquitehappyifwegetwhatwehavebeenaskingforfor\nseveral year.We do not expect something that knocks\nus off our feet, but just lightly caresses our face with\nthe satisfaction that we got something others have\nbeendoingforyear.Whilethisisnotnecessarilyabad\nthing,it is definitely not Applesque.\nRegardless of what I said above, I will probably still\nget the iPhone 6, because at this point I am sucked\ninto its eco system, as well as believing that it is a\ngreat phone, but still I am kind of disappointed. Oh\nwell,not every empire lasts forever right?\n\"Office is\nfree to all\nImperial\nstudents.\"\nImperial Software Shop\nBefore you buy any software while\nat Imperial, you should always\nfirst check out the Software Shop\nat Imperial just in case. They have\nseveral things, like anti-virus and\nmatlab for example, for free and\nothers like maple discounted.\nTo get to the software shop just\ngoogle Imperial Software shop, or\nalternatively visit the IT department\nand enquire about software there. I\nmean, it will only take about 5 extra\nminutes, but could save you a pretty\npenny.\nSpotify\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of this online\nsensation, then I suggest you get out\nfrom under that rock you have been\nliving under. Downloading music and\nowning it is so 2010 and instead we\nhave Spotify. Spotify comes in two\nflavours, free and premium.\nAs the name suggests, free is free.\nYou can listen to all the music you\nwant on your computer with the\noccasional (very repetitive) ads\nthrown in between. Also with the free\nversion you can use the spotify app,\nbut instead of being able to listen to\nany song you want, you have to listen\nto a shuffled playlist/artist/album\nincluding the song. Given that you\nonly have a limited amount of fast-forwarrds this means that you may\nhave to wait a bit to listen to the song\nyou want.\nThe premium one on the other\nhand costs \u00a39.99 a month (sorry\nImperial isn\u2019t part of NUS so we can\u2019t\nget that half price offer), but instead\nhas higher listening quality, offline\nplaylists, no ads and allows for you\nto play any song that you want on\nyour mobile. Given that most albums\ncost \u00a38 and upwards, this seems like\na good deal especially during exam\ntime when you just need to have a set\nof songs to help you study.\nLuckily enough there is a one\nmonth trial period, where you can use\nall of the premium benefits and then\ndecide if you want to continue.\nFree Office\nAt university it is vital that you own\nsome kind of office suite. You will\nneed to write lab reports, work with\ndata and make presentations. Now if\nyou have forgotten to purchase a set\n(or your parents forgot) then do not\nfret dear reader.\nHere are two suites that you can\nchoose between. Firstly we have\nMicrosoft Office. In the world of\nword, processing, spreadsheets and\npresentation software the Office suite\nis undoubtably king. A great thing\nis that Office is free to all Imperial\nstudents (Mac & PC). To install it,\njust go over to the Microsoft office\nsite, and log in with your Imperial\nemail. This will then redirect you to\nan Imperial webpage where you then\nverify that you really are at Imperial!\nIf this all sounds too difficult for\nyou, another option (and my personal\nfavourite) is OpenOffice. It includes\nall the same basic functionality\n(except Outlook) and does it almost\nin an identical manner. Furthermore\nit is also free! To get OpenOffice\njust google it, and you will be able to\ndownload it quite easily. The only\nthing you need to keep in mind is\nthat this software has its own data\nfiles, and if you want to work with\nothers who don\u2019t have OpenOffice\nyou will have to force it to save it in\nthe standard forms.\nApple Student Discount\nOk ok I know what you are going to\nsay; \u201chuge Apple Fan boi\u201d and you\nare probably right, but just hear me\nout on this. Nobody can deny that\nMacs, while slightly overpriced are\nwell-built machines that perform.\nFurthermore you always have a good\nport of call if anything ever goes\nwrong. Lastly, they are pretty nicely\ndesigned if I may say so myself. Now\nthe great thing is that Apple has up to\n\u00a3200 discount on their macs, making\nthem almost affordable.\nFurthermore because you are at\nImperial, Apple Care, Apple\u2019s own\ninsurance is also 10 pounds cheaper.\nTo claim these discounts just make\nsure you buy them while you are\nconnected to the Wifi and rejoice and\nthe shininess of your new laptop.\nNetflix\nStarting from \u00a35.99, you can be\nwatching as many movies from a\nwide selection as you want. Given\nthat downtime is absolutely vital to\nsurvival, having a good amount of\nquality (or not so quality) TV shows\nto watch is paramount. Furthermore\nthe internet in halls is incredibly fast,\nso for those of you lucky enough to\nbe living there this year, don\u2019t worry\nabout buffering.\nAnother benefit is the ability to\nstream Netflix from multiple devices,\nso if you own a console, tablet or\nsmartphone, all of these can be\nused to watch your movies. Just like\nspotify there is a 1-month free trial,\nso why not go ahead and try? Just\nkeep in mind that Netflix will send\nyou emails like an annoying ex-boyfriend/girlfriend for a while later.\nLatex\nWe discussed the more popular word-processing options, but this would\nnot be the Newspaper of Imperial\nCollege London if I didn\u2019t get even a\nlittle technical.\nTherefore I unveil Latex.This is not\nas much word-processing software\nas a \u2018language\u2019 that compiles to form\nyour document. To write things like\n\\pi which then becomes the beautiful\nletter \u03c0! Furthermore Latex is superb\nwith mathematical formulas, greek\nsymbols and formatting. That means\nnever again having to shout at Word\nfor messing up your entire document\nwhen you move a picture a tiny\npiece. Also the online community\nis extremely friendly, so you will\ndefinitely learn in no time.\nI know that some of you will shy\naway from having to learn this new\n\u201clanguage\u201d, but trust me, not only do\nthe results look amazing, you will\nimpress your lecturers and colleagues\nand have a new skill-set! To download\nLatex, just google it. Its free and\navailable for Mac, Windows and\nLinux.\nImperial Mobile App\nThe official App of Imperial College,\nit is a free download for Android and\niOS that gives you useful information\nas well as features throughout your\nstay at Imperial. You have a map\nof the campus, you can search the\nlibrary and check your library\naccount, see your time-table (only for\nsome departments though) among\nmany other things. Given that it is\nfree and yet quite useful, I would\ndefinitely recommend it.\nYoyo\nThis is Imperial\u2019s payment\nsystem, which works through your\nsmartphone. You download the app,\nconnect it to your bank account and\nthen you can pay at various outlets\nacross Imperial. It is incredibly\neasy and stops you having to wait in\nline for cash. Given that it is a free\ndownload for iOS and Android, this\nis another app that I think every\nImperial student should give a try.\niPhone 6, would Steve approve?\nJohannes Hoenigl thinks former Apple CEO Jobs wouldn\u2019t have...\n\"Attempt-ing to\nreach the\nback button is\ncompletely\nimpossi-ble.\"\n\"People\nwere quick\nto mock\nthe phone\nfor catching up\nwith features that\nAndroid\nsported\nsince 2012.\"\nAfter 4 years with my solid iPhone 4,\nyour resident Apple fanboy figured\nit was about time to upgrade before\nany details of the iPhone 6 were even\nleaked on the Internet. Hungry for\nthe jump in performance I was sad\nenough to reserve one in store to get\nmy hands on the newest merchandise\non release day. Having used the phone\nfor just under a week, I\u2019m battling\nsecond thoughts.\nIt shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise\nthat the specs have improved over\nthe 5s. The chipset is faster, the\nscreen is larger as well as brighter,\nand the camera has got a shiny\nnew algorithm. This step up in\nperformance is huge, especially if\nyou\u2019ve upgraded from an older phone\nlike myself. It\u2019s beautifully designed,\nbut not quite as smooth around the\nedges as one would expect.\nPeople were quick to mock the\nphone for catching up with features\nthat Android sported since 2012.\nWhile criticism is justified they are\nmissing the point. Looking at the\nproduct releases that turned Apple\ninto the company it is today is\nrevealing. The iPod wasn\u2019t the first\nportable MP3 player, the iPhone\nwasn\u2019t the first smartphone, and the\niPad wasn\u2019t the first tablet either.\nYet they all came to define their\nrespective markets. Why?\nTheir products were quite simply\nbetter at giving the customer what\nthey really wanted. This obsessive\nattention to detail, especially when\nit came to the user experience, ran\ndeep within Jobs\u2019 DNA. The 6 is\ndisappointing because it fails to\nfully deliver on that expectation.\nThere are two things that illustrate\nthis perfectly; one is the protruding\ncamera, the other is the larger screen\nsacrificing ergonomics. Both would\nhave the man who once accused\nMicrosoft of having no taste and\nmaking third-rate products turning\nin his grave.\nThe camera is identical to the\nhardware found in the 5s, but comes\nwith some new functions courtesy\nof the new and improved chipset.\nHowever, it sticks out the back\nby about 1mm, a fact that Apple\nsneakily attempts to hide in all their\nmarketing material and falsely\nadvertise the phone as the thinnest\niPhone yet (6.9mm or 7.1mm for the\n6 Plus). In truth, both versions are\naround about the same thickness\nas the 5s. It seems as if there was a\nthinner camera in the pipeline that\nfailed to materialise in time for\nrelease. Otherwise, why wouldn\u2019t you\ngive us a bigger battery to make the\nback flush with the lens? At best this\nis a nuisance hidden away in a case,\nat worst it shows a lack of the very\nattention to detail that made Apple\nproducts stand out.\nThe biggest crime however is the\ndistinct sacrifice of ergonomics in\nfavour of more screen real estate.\nJobs once proclaimed 3.5\u201d as the\nperfect touchscreen size for phones.\nConsidering Apple has held out\nagainst moving to larger screens\nfor so long, one would expect a\nsignificant amount of thought would\ngo into designing the user interface\nfor one-handed operation once they\ndid jump ship. Apart from a halfhearted attempt by introducing\n\u2018reachability\u2019, nothing of the kinds\nseemed to have happened.\nWhether this is a key issue wholly\ndepends on how you use your\nsmartphone. I almost exclusively used\nthe 4 one handed, without preference\nfor either my left or right. It was a\nnon-handed design, simply by virtue\nof comfortably being able to reach\nthe entirety of the screen with your\nthumb. It was going to be ergonomic,\nno matter how stupidly the app\nbuttons were arranged on the screen.\nThis is no longer the case with\nthe 6. Take for instance the built in\nmessaging app. The keyboard along\nthe bottom of the screen is a stretch\nand the phone sits nowhere near as\nnicely in your palm as the previous\nphones. Typing one handed on the\ngo you invariably end up fumbling\naround, not a good combination\nwith the slippery aluminium back.\nAttempting to reach the back button\nis completely impossible without\neither adjusting your grip or double\ntapping the home button to activate\n\u2018reachability\u2019. Both are nothing more\nthan a workaround until an elegant\nsolution to the underlying problem\nis found through app and OS re-design. Having had a quick play with\na friend\u2019s Android, they are miles\nahead in that respect.\nSo should you get it? It depends\non how you use your phone. If you\nalmost exclusively use it one handed,\nsticking with your 5/s/c for another\nyear would save you from having\nto go through the pains of an early\nadopter, while the app developers\nplay catch-up.\nOn the other hand, if you\u2019re already\nin the two hands camp, by all means\ngo for it. The 6 Plus will probably be\na better fit; as long as you don\u2019t carry\nit in your trouser pockets, because\nnobody likes bent phones.\n\n"

Photo: Raincatcher Imperial\nRaincatcher Imperial is a student-led charity with a rich history of\nboth infrastructure and community\ndevelopment projects since our\nformation in 2008. We work with\nRaincatcher, a registered charity\nunder the UK Charity Commission\nand local non-governmental\norganisations (NGOs) such as Caritas\nin Tabora, Tanzania. Since 2009, we\nhave visited various communities in\narid regions of Tanzania, with an aim\nto improve access to and education of\nclean water, sanitation and hygiene.\nWe welcome all students from any\nacademic background, and as we are\ngathering more freshers this year, it is\nour goal to tell you more about what\nwe do and how we aim to achieve\nthose end results.\nA team of 4 of our members this\nsummer spent a long 9 weeks in\nTabora, Tanzania to work hand in\nhand with the local communities\nto achieve the aims we had set as\nan organisation. With only an\nintensive trip preparation course\nprepared by our charity trustees\nand some guidance from past teams,\nthe team bravely journeyed into an\nenvironment expecting language\ndifficulties, culture shocks and even\nthe occasional diarrhoea.\nYet, with all odds against them, they\nhave once again done our charity\nproud by not only completing a\n50,000L over ground ferro-cement\ntank in the vicinities of a Primary\nschool in Tabora, but also engaged\nthe members of the community by\nempowering locals to pass on their\nwater jar construction knowledge and\nenforce basic sanitary habits within\ntheir families.\nTanzania is a country poor in\neconomy but rich in community\nspirit. Friendly conversations would\nsimply flow between people who do\nnot know one another and it gave me\na much differed experience to living\nback in my hometown.\nOur trip took place in the 6 month\nlong dry season period in Tanzania,\nand there I really experienced the\nvalue of clean, potable water. Every\nday, children at the primary school\nwould make multiple trips to fetch\nsurface pond water from a location 15\nminutes walk away. Even when they\nknew the water was so bad and turbid,\nthey still consumed such dirty water. I\nmyself however was fortunate enough\nto purchase drinking water and to\nhave taken vaccines, thereby avoiding\nmany diseases commonly found in\nthat region such as Typhoid, Hepatitis\nA and Malaria. But do the locals? Join\nus in our work, and actively strive to\ngive a better life to Tanzanians. We\naim not to make a large difference\nby ourselves, but to inspire many to\njoin the work we do and maybe one\nday, to see our combined efforts sum\nup to something appreciable on the\nnational scale.\nWe, also had the chance to take\na break after our charity work and\nenjoy the picturesque landscape\nof what Tanzania has to offer. The\nnever-ending blue skies and rushing\ntides along the shoreline in Zanzibar\nbeach are a far cry from the gloomy\nLondon weather in winter, often\naccompanied by the cacophony\nfrom heavy traffic. Taking in such\nwell-appreciated tranquillity while\nenjoying the sunset on the horizon, it\ncan just take your breath away.\nRaincatcher Imperial has\naccomplished much since its\nestablishment, and our programmes\nhave placed us at a good position to\nfulfill our long term goals. However\nwe need more enthusiastic and\nkeen individuals who dare to dream\na better future for all, to venture\nbeyond their boundaries of first\nworld comfort and to touch the hearts\nand lives of those in need.

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 41\nFELIX\nSports Editor: Kunal Wagle\nICUAFC\u2019s summer tour got off to a\nshaky start. Since all bad experiences\nstart in the u`Union we thought this\nwas the best option to begin what\nwould become the worst week of our\nlives so far.\nThe flight was tedious, but soon\nwe arrived in Malaga and tour could\nstart in earnest. After checking into\nour home for the next 4 days, we set\noff in search of the beach. Despite it\nonly being a short walk, the group\nstruggled but eventually everyone\nmade it and promptly got in a little\nkeepy-uppy practice.\nThe first night was certainly eye-opening: heading out after dinner we\nfound the city empty. Apparrently\nno-one had received the memo saying\nthat Spaniards don\u2019t even think about\ngoing out until midnight. We had\nprecisely zero chance of scoring with\nthe locals but if there\u2019s one thing\nwe don\u2019t lack its enthusiasm so we\ncarried on regardless.\nThemorning-after-the-night-before\nrequired some R & R so we headed to\nthe beach to exhibit the best qualities\nof Brits travelling abroad: alcohol\npoisoning and sunburns.\nOn Tuesday we had our first match\nagainst Sevilla FC in front of a\nbumper crowd of seven. This broke\nICUAFC\u2019s previous record crowd by\nseven. The game was a cagey affair\nwith neither team managing to break\nthe deadlock early on. Ivan Rakitic,\nin what would be his last game for\nSavilla before Barcelona came calling,\nwas running the game early doors but\nit soon became clear he had met his\nmatch.\nNot usually known as a midfield\ngeneral Rakitic\u2019s tireless running and\nimpressive distribution put seasoned\ncampaigners, such as Uptight\nand Shatner, to shame. Drawing\ncomparisons to a young Clarence\nSeedorf he was at hand in the first\ngoal, playing a delightful through ball\nto an onrushing Frankel who poked\nthe ball through the goalkeeper\u2019s\nlegs. Frankel was determined to\nwin the golden boot outright this\ntime, having had to share it with an\nICUAFC legend the previous year.\nThe two teams went in to half-time\nwith ICUAFC leading by the solitary\ngoal. After a quick siesta the two\nteams returned and it soon became\nclear that despite winning the Europa\nLeague just a few weeks previously,\nthis was the match that Sevilla\nreally wanted to win. They came out\nwith fire in their bellies and soon\nconverted this energy in to goals with\na quick double salvo from Rakitic\nputting the hosts ahead. It would need\na spirited comeback from ICUAFC to\ncome away with the three points and\nunfortunately they were only almost\nup to the challenge.\nA blinding save by ICUAFC led to\na speedy counterattack with Frosty\nracing down the wing. He played the\nball round the centre back leaving\nFringe with just the goalie to beat.\nCould he do it? Yes, he could. The ball\nnestled in the back of the net and it\nwas suddenly game on. IQ got back\ninto the game and the momentum\nswung from Sevilla to ICUAFC.\nBrownfinger and Uptight supported\nIQ and the wingers, Nob Mez and\nScurvy were causing all sorts of\ntrouble on the touchline. However\nfatigue set in and with just minutes\nleft on the clock Rakitic completed\nhis trick winning the game for Sevilla.\nSevilla FC are due back in England\nfor the away leg in November, but it is\nhard to see them getting anything at\nthe Fortress.\nWednesday meant a change of\nscenery with the second half of the\ntrip to Seville. To make the most of\nthe afternoon, everyone except The\nMilky Bar Big, who was AWOL, went\non a walking tour to take in as much\nculture as humanly possible.\nThe final footballing encounter\nsaw ICUAFC taking part in the 56th\nanniversary celebrations of a local\nclub. After being presented with the\ntrophy before kick-off ICUAFC were\nfeeling complacent and this lead to\nconceding 3 early goals. After some\nstern words at half time ICUAFC got\none back. Frankel instinctively played\nit over the top, sending the ball home\nover the onrushing keeper. Despite\nAlfonso\u2019s best Alfonso impressions\nthe equaliser was one step too far and\nanother disappointing defeat ensued.\nFears Plaque was crowned Player of\nTour and Alfred, Ian and Isa were\nthanked for translating for the week\nand not letting anyone die. There\nwas then just time for one last trip\nto Belindo, which was unanimously\ndeclared the best night-club in the\nworld.\nThe next day was home time. It had\nbeen an emotional week and everyone\nhad come out of it a bigger man. The\nflight back was uneventful although it\nwas delayed due to a problem with the\nleft falanage.\nWe returned back to the misery\nof modern Britain but we were all\nrelieved to be back, in the motherland\nand return to our families, where our\nMums could cook us dinner and wash\nour clothes and cuddle us through our\ntears.\nICUAFC\u2019s 2014 summer tour was\nsponsored by Nando\u2019s.\nPhoto: Wikipedia/Ludovic P\u00e9ron\nICUAFC: fiestas and fiascos of a summer tour\nMATTHEW CANN\nTOUR SECRETARY\nTHILANKA JAYSEKERA\nJON PRING\nDRIVERS\nIt was an early start. The team of 10\ngathered at the motor club garage\nat 1.00 on Saturday morning for the\n250 mile drive up North for the 7.00\ncircuit briefing. With bleary eyes and\nall the racing gear and camping kit\nthrown into the back of the minibus\nwe set off up the M1.\nAfter much sleep, a traditional\nMcDonalds breakfast and a colourful\nsunrise greeted us with much\nappreciation. And as a bonus, no rain!\nA two-hour practice and qualifying\nsession was enough to wake most\nof us up, in blisteringly fast karts\ncapable of 70mph! The 1.3km track\nat Teeside Autodrome was very fast\nwith a mixture of high-speed corners\nand challenging chicanes, with the\npractice giving us all a taster of just\nhow much of a challenge 24 hours on\ntrack will be. Jon Pring set the fastest\ntime of the team, qualifying us in\n12th place out of 40 teams. However,\nthe race was far from over with 24\nhours for anything to happen.\nAt 13.00, we positioned ourselves\non the grid. The first driver out,\nGeoffrey Marcel lined up on the other\nside of the track, waiting with focus\nand calmly for the Union Jack to\ndrop. For this was a Classic Le Mans\nstyle start where the drivers run over\nthe track to their vehicles, so athletic\nability and reaction times were key.\nThe start was good, we cheered\nGeoffrey on as he gained 4 places in\nhis first lap. But this was a long game,\nso we left him to settle into his 1hr\nlong stint. Our team strategy was to\nstay on track, look after the tyres and\nminimize kart damage by staying off\nthe kerbs.\nDrivers Thilanka Jayasekera,\nThomas Jones, Thomas Arscott,\nCharlies Osio, Tianquin Bao,\nAnthony Vaquero, & Arnaud\nWolfer all put in very impressive\nperformances throughout the\nafternoon and night, alternating\nbetween pit stop crew, driving and\nsleeping. For many of these drivers it\nwas their first ever race.\nAfter much barbequed breakfast,\nlunch, and dinner, the race was\nfinally coming to a close. Jon took the\nfinal session, gaining on the previous\nrace leaders, Oxford University,\nand a tired Oxford driver found the\npressure too great, forcing their kart\ninto a spin! We crossed the chequered\nflag in a respectable 27th with many\nmemories of such a great race, and\nalready planning on how to improve\nour performance for next year.\nFancy joining us? We can usually be\nfound in our garage on Unwin Road\nrestoring our Classic Mini, which we\nare planning to rebuild the engine in\nthe autumn term.\nNew to this year, we will be hosting\na cheap karting championship\nthroughout the season and aiming to\ncontinue our success in the British\nUniversities Karting Championship\nacross the country.\nC&G Motor Club hit the racetrack for 24 hours straight\n\n"

Find a broad selection on Level 5. Photo: Imperial College London\nDiana Lucaci has some tips to make sure you don\u2019t stop reading\n\"Cater-for-all\ngiants [...]\nregularly\nhold\nliterary\nevents.\"\n\"Freshers'\nWeek\nmarked the\nend of my\nbookworm\nhabits.\"\nFresher\u2019s Week marked the end my\nbookworm habits. The shockwave of\nUniversity life knocked me over with\ndistractions: meeting too many new\npeople, learning how to put together\nsomething more than a bowl of cereal,\nand, of course, attending lectures\n(otherwise known as managing your\nsleep debt). So in case you struggle\nsaying no to that after-party, here\u2019s a\nlittle help in saying yes to finishing\nthat Tolstoy instead.\nStep 1. How to find non-science related books around\ncampus\nLevel 5, Central Library: Please don\u2019t\nbecome one of those students about to\ngraduate who still doesn\u2019t know about\nthis sanctuary in the otherwise not-so-sanctuary-like library. (Or that they\nhave a good selection on Dostoyevsky.)\nWith the doors of the library open\n24 hours, instead of heading for that\nkebab to curb your 4am munchies, go\nand pick up a gothic horror story to\nread under the full moon.\nICSF Library: Run by the Imperial\nCollege Science FRun by the Imperial\nCollege Science Fiction and Fantasy\nSociety, this enchanting space holds\nmore than 9400 books, 2200 DVDs\nand 500 graphic novels. If you\u2019re\ninterested in science fiction, fantasy or\nhorror, this is the place to be. During\nterm times, it is officially open every\nweekday lunchtime from 12:00\u201314:00,\nbut the pull of the ICSF library is\nalmost always strong enough to trap\nat least one committee member in\nthe library well after lectures end. To\nborrow books you need to be an ICSF\nmember, which costs \u00a38 per year.\nStep 2. How to meet fellow\nbookworms around campus\nThis can be a tricky one, especially\nThis can be a tricky one, especially\nmeeting practising bookworms.\nHowever, your chances will increase\nimmensely if you are a member of the\nfollowing societies.\nBook Club: With monthly\nmeetings, thereWith monthly\nmeetings, there is plenty of time\nto read whatever book has been\nchosen by the current members\n(by democratic vote). The chosen\nnovels can be bought from the club\ncommittee at a reduced price (usually\naround \u00a32-\u00a35); or, like me, you can try\nto find them in the Central Library,\nwith occasional success. The books\nchosen last year were laudable \u2013\nabsorbing, diverse and short enough\nto be read easily within a month. With\nmembership costing only \u00a33, this was\nmy saviour last year (alas, even reading\ncan be helped by deadlines and peer\npressure).\nScience Fiction and Fantasy: I\u2019ll\nsay it again: 9400 books, 2200 DVDs\nand 500 graphic novels. In the Beit\nQuad. For \u00a38 a year. But if you need\nany more convincing, join the society\nfor book crawls around London\u2019s\nbest SF&F booksellers, regular video\nshowings, cinema outings and an end\nof the year trip to Hay-on-Wye, a\nsmall town in Wales with the greatest\ndensity of second hand bookshops\nper person in the UK. The society also\norganises Picocon in February, an\nannual convention showcasing guest\nauthors, book sales, special events and\ngames. Sold?\nStep 3. How to take advantage\nof your new city\nBy the end of your first week at\nImperial, you will become aware of\nmost of the downsides of living in\nLondon, such as the cost and size\nof your accommodation and the\nstate of your wallet after a night\u2019s\nout. However, your awareness of the\nupsides will not be correlated to the\nlength of time that you live here,\nbut to the amount of time you spend\noutside of campus. So please, please,\nget out (and not just to nightclubs \u2013\nthey\u2019re overrated and overpriced).\nTo help you, here is a short (and\nhardly exhaustive!) list of some of the\nupcoming literary events in London\nthat will hopefully whet your appetite\neven further for some good old\nreading.\nLondon Literature Festival: The\nSouthbank hosts a range of events\nexploring the power of the printed\nword in changing the world for the\nbetter. Featuring double Booker prize\nwinner Hilary Mantel, Stephen Fry,\ncontroversial philosopher Slavoj\n\u017di\u017eek and prize-winning poets such as\nAlice Oswald and Kate Tempest, the\nfestival concentrates on the themes\nof freedom, justice and democracy. So\nhead down to the Southbank Centre\nfor an inspired way to celebrate the\npower of literature to transform lives.\n30 September 2014 \u2013 13 October 2014;\nStudent ticket: \u00a34-\u00a310\nTerror and Wonder: The Gothic\nImagination: Two hundred rare\nobjects trace 250 years of Gothic\ntradition at the British Library. Come\nhere to explore an array of delectably\ndark artefacts: books, such as the\nhandwritten drafts of Frankenstein\nand Dracula, posters, films and, most\nimportantly, a vampire slaying kit.\nFrom Marry Shelley and Bram Stoker\nto Stanley Kubrick and Alexander\nMcQueen, this exhibition promises\nto delight fans of the mysterious, the\nterrifying and the macabre.\n3 October 2014 \u2013 20 January 2015;\nStudent ticket: \u00a35\nBookstores: London has a wealth\nof bookstores ranging from small,\nspecialist shops (such as comics store\nGosh! in Bloomsbury) to cater-forall\ngiants (like Foyles on Charing Cross\nRoad) that regularly hold literary\nevents. Reserve a place online\nfor stand-up shows about books,\nafternoon signings or discussions\nabout upcoming writers.\nStep 4. Write for Felix!\nAnd finally, why not contribute to\nthe Felix Books section? From writing\nbook reviews and author profiles to\npublishing your own poem or short\nstory, this could be a great incentive\nto get some interesting reading\ndone.

Arriving late on\nthe Friday evening there was sadly no\nrunning done on the first day due to a\nlack of sunlight. This didn\u2019t dampen\nspirits however; an early advance party\nled by last year\u2019s treasurer Harveen\nHayer had mustered up a small feast\nto prepare the late arriving minibus of\nathletes for the packed weekend ahead.\nThe next morning there were early\npre-breakfast runs from some, whilst\nothers including webmaster Duncan\nIngram and myself chose to wait until\nafter food before heading to nearby\nYeovil for a track session to sharpen up\nour speed for upcoming races, along\nwith pacing support provided by Sport\nImperial\u2019s Athlete of the Year Chris\nBannon. Those not running around in\ncircles then headed off to indulge in\nsome river swimming after a second\nrun of the day in the midday sun. All\nwere soon back relaxing at the hostel,\nwith some nursing bruises from a\nrather precarious rope swing! In the\nearly evening we headed out again, this\ntime to Glastonbury Tor itself for hill\nreps weaving between tourists! Both\nthose running and also those cheering\nfrom the top with the first beers of the\nnight received many strange looks.\nSpecial mentions should go to James\nEllis for claiming the fastest time up\nthe tor (beating many local runner\u2019s\ntimes as well), to next year\u2019s captain\nMatt Douthwaite for completing a\npartial rep whilst giving a piggyback,\nand to Matthias Knop; who completed\na full rep with a crate of beers, holding\nhis own with all but the fastest few!\nOnce hill reps were done, nearly all\nhad done enough running; with the\ndaily mileage for some reaching nearly\n40km! Returning to the hostel again\nthere was a circuits and stretching\nsession led by Alwyn Elliot in the\nfading evening light for most, whilst\na few took one last easy jog to loosen\noff tired legs. Both these sessions\nfinished abruptly thanks to some\nmaverick pace setting in the closing\nstages on the run and the suggestion\nof tour tradition \u201cDrinking Jenga\u201d for\nthose doing circuits. The evening that\nfollowed may only serve to reinforce\nthe opinion that XC&A celebrate as\nmuch as they train. I would go into\nmore detail, but what goes on Tor stays\non Tor.\nThe Sunday morning consisted of\na late start, with a post breakfast long\nrun on the agenda for all but a few to\nget rid of the toxins from the night\nbefore. This was followed by a trip\nto a local pub for a fantastic Sunday\nroast before the group headed back to\n\"I would go\ninto more\ndetail, but\nwhat goes\non Tor\nstays on\nTor\"\n\"Those not\nrunning\naround in\ncircles then\nheaded off \"\nImperial Cross Country go on \u2018Tor\u2019\nLondon (with a brief sight-seeing stop\nat Stonehenge) to catch up on sleep\nand to relive the memories in hushed\nvoices so as not to be overheard.\nSpecial thanks should be given to\nall those involved; notably Harveen,\nAlwyn, and Matt without whom the\ntour wouldn\u2019t have gone ahead, and to\nall of those who mucked in throughout\nthe weekend to keep all the activities\nrunning smoothly.\nFor any freshers wanting to get\ninvolved with one of the most\nwelcoming clubs in Imperial come\nand find Cross Country & Athletics on\nQueen\u2019s Lawn at the Freshers Fair.

In\na fresher\u2019s issue special, this time we\nshow you what you may have missed\nwhilst you were on the beach this\nsummer.\nIn the FIFA World Cup, Germany\ncame out winners after beating Argentina 1-0 after extra time. In a\nhugely embarrassing week, Brazil\nlost their semi-final 7-1 before being\nthumped by the Netherlands 3-0 in\nthe third place playoff.\nIn a seesaw title race Lewis Hamilton has the advantage (at the time of\nwriting) over his Mercedes teammate\nNico Rosberg with just five races to go\nin the Formula One season.\nIn cricket, Alistair Cook answered\nhis test match critics as England beat\nIndia 3-1, only to be dispatched by the\nsame score line in the one-day series.\nAlso, Yorkshire won their first County Championship in thirteen years, although it wasn\u2019t without controversy\n\u2013 captain Andrew Gale had the dubious privilege of being charged with\nmaking racist comments in the roses\nmatch \u2013 the first English person to be\naccused of such an offence. Mumbai\nIndians\u2019 title defence in the Champions League crashed and burned in the\nqualification round.\nBath and Saracens have made\nstorming starts to the Aviva Premiership in rugby union. Bath took apart\nLeicester 45-0 to keep their winning\nrecord, whilst Saracens crushed Harlequins at The Stoop 39-0 to stay in\ntouch at the top. New Zealand has\nthe lead in the Rugby Championship,\nwith Australia and South Africa tied\nin second.\nAfter a tough summer, Andy Murray has lost his place in the top ten in\nworld tennis. He lost in the Wimbledon and US Open quarterfinals, and\nnow faces a stiff challenge to qualify\nfor the World Tour Finals in November. Murray will be aiming to overtake Marin Cilic, who was the surprise\nwinner of the US Open in September.\nHe beat Roger Federer in the semi-fi-nal, before overcoming Kei Nishikori\nto take his first Grand Slam title.\nRory McIlroy underlined his status\nas the one to watch in golf, as he took\nvictory in the Open, and followed it\nup with the US PGA Championship.\nHe is now the world number one and\nwill be confident of helping Europe to\nvictory in the Ryder Cup, which will\nhave just happened as we go to print.\nEngland had a hugely successful\nCommonwealth Games in Glasgow,\nas they topped the medal table, despite losing star man Mo Farah to\nillness.\nThe early season league premier\nleague table suggests that Chelsea\nhave made the most of the transfer\nwindow as their new signing Diego\nCosta has continued his prolific form.\nManchester United spent north of\n\u00a3150 million during the summer, but\nresults are yet to show for it.\nWhat happened in Sport this summer\nKUNAL WAGLE\nSECTION EDITOR\nThis is not a sport featured in Felix this week.

Photo: Imperial College London\n\"If anyone\nwho knows\nanybody\nwho would\nlike their\nname on\nthe front\nof our\nlibrary, let\nus know!\"\n\"90% of\nnegative\ncomments\nregarding\nthe Library\nsaid it was\nsimply too\nhot.\"\nThe Central Library has seen major\nredevelopments over the summer to\nintroduce new study spaces, facilities\nand technological aids. A new\nassistive technology room has been\ninstalled on Level 1, 200 new study\nspaces have been introduced on Level\n3, and a whole new facility has been\ninstated on Level 4 for a Centre of\nDoctorate Training. They also, among\nother things, plan to introduce an\niPad loan scheme in the near future.\nTowards the end of the last\nacademic year, it was also announced\nby Felix that air conditioning may\nfinally be installed. However, Felix\nhas now found that installation of the\nfabled air conditioning system has\nnow been put on hold.\nPlanning permission for a cooling\nunit to be placed on the Sherfield\nBuilding roof was granted before the\nsummer period by the Chelsea and\nWestminster Council. This cooling\nunit, alongside the installation of\ncooling beams in the ceilings, would\nhave provided adequate climate\ncontrol that would have hopefully\ncooled off the hotter floors of the\nlibrary, which are known to be almost\nsubtropical in nature during the\nsummer months.\nThe proposed cooling beams are\ndesigned to drop pockets of cool air\nshould the temperature get too high,\nalthough their function demands\nan increase in electronic usage. The\ninstallation of these cooling beams\nwould have therefore required a\ncomplete overhaul of the electronic\ninfrastructure, something that caused\na hike in the price of the installations.\nThis coupled with the necessity to\nonly work intensively around the\nclock during the summer, so as to\nminimise disruption to Library users\nduring term time, the installation was\nbudgeted at more than the College\nwere willing to spend.\nInstallation of the cooling beams\nwas therefore considered a high\nrisk project given its feasibility\nand price; coupled with the risk of\ndisturbing campus neighbours with\nthe construction work, the College\ndecided to deny the project funding.\nAllegedly, orders had already been\nplaced on some equipment for the\nclimate control provisions before\nfunding was denied.\nThe Library initially appealed to\nthe College with refurbishment plans\nworth around \u00a327m. These proposals\ncovered the climate control plans\nalongside other redevelopments, and\nafter re-evaluation of the budgets, the\nLibrary received between five and six\nmillion in total. However, this would\nnot have covered the air conditioning\ninstallation, so the plans for the\ncooling beams have been stalled.\nFelix spoke to Chris Banks, the\nDirector of Central Library, about the\nsituation.\n\u201cThe key thing now is identifying\nthe funding needed. If anyone who\nknows anybody who would like their\nname on the front of our library, let\nus know!\nThe crucial thing for students is\nto make their voice heard. This is\na problem and has been a problem\nstudents have been talking about this\nfor years.\u201d\nThe approval process for the\nexpenditure of the redevelopment\nencompassed many senior members\nof College staff including previous\nRector, Sir Keith O\u2019Nions. One\nanonymous source said that O\u2019Nions\nwas allegedly reluctant to approve\nthe budget because he didn\u2019t think\nstudents were bothered by the heat:\n\u201che apparently had never received any\nemails from students complaining\nabout the heat, so didn\u2019t think it was\na concern.\u201d\nSo could we still have climate\ncontrol provisions in place in\nthe future if the College were to\nchange their minds? For now, it\nlooks unlikely. However, after Felix\ncontacted college\u2019s Operations\nDivision who oversee various\nredevelopment projects on campus,\nthey said that \u201cthe timeframe for\ninstallation will be linked to other\nmajor works planned for the Library\nas part of the ongoing programme.\nLibrary users will be kept informed of\nplans once the likely start date for the\nwork has been determined.\u201d\nThere is no guarantee of funding\nfor next summer, although the\ndemand for a climate control system\nin the library is high. In the NSS\nresponses this year, 90% of negative\ncomments regarding the Library said\nit was simply too hot in the summer\nmonths, whilst Library\u2019s own Space\nSurvey found that most students\nidentified the heat as an issue.\nThis is not the first time attempt\nto introduce air cooling systems into\nthe Library. Previously, planning\npermission was requested to instate\nan external cladding across the\nLibrary that would have reduced\nthe external heating of the building\nwhile leaving the internal climate\nunchanged. However, permission for\nthis was denied, and it was back to\nsquare one for the Central Library.\nOn 25th June, it was announced\nthat Imperial College London had\npurchased a new sports ground in\nHeston, a site that, according to the\nCollege, \"represents an excellent\nopportunity for College sports.\u201d\nDue to this new purchase, Sport\nImperial also announced that\nthey were then going to halt sport\nat Teddington, a sports ground\nfrequented by the medic sports teams\nand steeped in medic tradition and\nhistory. The College announced that\n\u201cwhilst no formal decision has been\nmade there are no plans for student\nsport to take place at Teddington in\nthe future.\u201d\nThe announcement lead to a public\noutcry from medical students, who\nassembled in their hundreds to sign\nan online petition against the closure.\nMany cited the issue of requiring\na longer travel time to the Heston\ngrounds, although most were angry\nat the closure of a site that had been\nused for almost a century.\nIn another statement by Imperial\nCollege Union, it was stated that\nalthough the Union President of the\nlast academic year, David Goldsmith,\nwas privy to the information\nconcerning the purchase of Heston,\nhe was unable to tell other students\ndue to the \u201ccommercial sensitivity\u201d of\nthe topic.\nThe Student Consultation\nFramework set by David Goldsmith\nin the last year was completely\nignored during the process. No other\nSabbatical Officers were aware of the\npurchase, or the effect it would have\non Teddington, until it was finalised.\nIn an email that went out to the\nMedical School earlier in September,\nDariush Hassanzadeh-Baboli, the\ncurrent ICSMSU President, detailed\nhow the decision to close Teddington\nhad been made without any student\nconsultation. He went on to say that\n\u201cbig decisions that disrupt the history\nand traditions of our Medical School,\nshould not be made without the\nstudents being thoroughly consulted.\u201d\nBut why was the purchase of Heston\nkept so hush-hush? And why were\nno students consulted on closure of\nTeddington?\nHeston was previously owned by\nBritish Airways (BA), which was\nthen known as the British Airways\nConcorde Club, and was used by their\nstaff for recreational purposes. Union\nsources have told Felix that the\nCollege was keen to avoid upsetting\nthe members of the BA staff, who\nhave previously gone on strike in the\npast. Not only that, but the College\nwas not the only interested buyer for\nthe site.\nFelix met with the current Deputy\nPresident (Clubs and Societies) Abi de\nBruin and Dariush earlier this month\nto discuss what had happened since\nthe announcement.\nDariush stressed how even since the\nannouncement, Sport Imperial have\nbeen difficult to get straight answers\nfrom, which has led to further\nfriction between the Medics and Sport\nImperial. Dariush said, \u201cit\u2019s taken two\nmonths to get answers about this.\nI\u2019ve been asking Neil Moseley [Head\nof Sport Imperial] questions and not\nbeing able to get straight answers... he\nwouldn\u2019t give me adequate answers,\nalthough there were still things\nhe was unsure about.\u201d Organising\nmeetings with the College over the\nsummer in regards to the move to\nHeston also proved difficult. Trying\nto organise a meeting with Simon\nHarding Roots [Head of Imperial\u2019s\nOperations group, which oversees\noperating services on campus] took\ntwo months according to Dariush.\nSaid Abi, \u201c[For some people] it became\nimpossible to get replies over the\nsummer.\u201d\nMoseley also initially denied the\nMedics any access to the grounds\nonce the decision had been made to\nclose them. Dariush said that they\nwere told that \u201cthere is no way we\ncan have any access to Teddington\nfrom September and [they] wouldn\u2019t\neven compromise with any sort\nof day, such as a celebration day.\u201d\nHowever, two final days have now\nbeen negotiated for use of the site,\nalthough Dariush was keen to point\nout this was potentially facilitated\nby Debra Humphries, the ProRector (Education), as opposed to\nrepresentatives from Sport Imperial.\nBut will Heston even be ready for\nthe start of term? Two rugby pitches\nhave been lost with the closure of\nTeddington, although there are plans\nto put a second rugby pitch in Heston\nas compensation. However, the\norganisation of this has also caused\nissues. Said Dariush, \u201cI can see it being\nan absolute state at the beginning of\nthe season.\u201d\nAlthough the College no longer\npays for the upkeep of Teddington,\nthe College still owns the ground\nand a local school in the area now\npays for its upkeep. The current\nstaffing system for both Teddington\nand Heston sites is also being\nrestructured, with people having\nto reapply for new jobs in the new\nsystem.\nDariush detailed particular concern\nfor one popular groundskeeper who\nhas been there for 15 years and has a\nstrong relationship with the students.\nSaid Dariush, \u201cwe are quite concerned\nabout him, he\u2019s part of the Medical\nSchool in principle. We tried to get an\nanswer from [Sport Imperial] but did\nnot receive a straight answer again.\u201d\nAbi said that overall however, \u201csome\njobs will likely be lost.\u201d\nSo what is the future for\nTeddington? It seems that the College\nare adamant that student sport will\nnever return to the site, but it has left\nmore students upset than concerned\nover the move that has lacked\nany sort of student consultation\nwhatsoever. Said Abi, \u201cThey are\ncontinually doing things that have\ncommercial sensitivity and then\nusing [that] as a blanket to not say a\nword to anybody and not put proper\nprovisions in place.\u201d\nDariush succinctly summed the\nfears up of the students affected: \u201cwe\nfear that students at Imperial are\nnot being treated as a major priority;\nprofits and prestige appear to come\nfirst.\u201d\n\n"

For the first time ever there\nwere four current students flying\nin the UK Junior Nationals gliding\ncompetition. Tom Arscott was flying\nImperial's own ASW-24 glider in his\nthird season and going for the win.\nJohnny Paterson was returning to\ncompetition flying in his DG-200\nwhile Guy Dutton and Johannes\nHoenigl, having both started gliding\nat Imperial were competing for the\nfirst time in a pair of Discuses \u2013 one\nowned by ICGC and the other was\nhired thanks to a grant from Sport\nImperial.\nIn competitive gliding, pilots have\nto fly around a series of specified\nturn-points dotted around the course\nin the correct order. This is known\nas the 'task' and can cover distances\nof over 300km, with gliders flying\nat speeds of up to 160mph! The pilot\nwho completes the task in the least\ntime wins the day and the pilot with\nthe most points after 9 days wins the\ncompetition. So what's the catch?\nWe don't have engines! A good pilot\nuses thermal updrafts to climb,\nthen converts height into speed to\ncover the distance required. A less\nproficient pilot uses a few thermals to\nhop along until he runs out of sky and\nflops into a field.\nThis year there were 47 pilots\ncompeting in the 'Juniors', as it is\nknown, with ages ranging between\n17 - 25 and a wide spread of abilities.\nThose competing for their first time\nwere simply trying to finish the\ntask, while the more experienced\ncompetitors were aiming for faster\nspeeds. The Weather Gods were kind\nand provided 8 competition days out\nof a possible 9 - a vintage year! The\nfirst four days proved tricky, day 3\neven saw the entire grid of 55 gliders\nland-out in fields! Nevertheless Tom\nsecured top-10 positions on most days.\nMeanwhile the rest of us sampled\nthe various fields and airfields of the\nSouth of England, culminating with\nGuy and Johannes dropping into RAF\nBoscombe Down for a cup of tea.\nPerformances improved during\nthe week as all four of us completed\na 300km task, a first for Guy while\nTom won the day with a blistering\naverage speed of 99.7kph. By the end\nof the week Guy had made it into\nthe top half of the field and finished\n23rd. Johnny cruised into 20th after\na consistent week and Johannes\nmanaged to hang on to 18th despite\nnot flying the last day due to man-flu.\nTom put us all to shame and came\n4th out of 47 competitors, a fantastic\nachievement which may earn him a\nplace on the British Junior national\nteam for the next Junior World\nChampionships in Australia.\nBut you don't have to be a\ncompetition ace to try gliding! ICGC is\nthe cheapest and most enjoyable way\nto learn to fly while at University. Last\nyear Nick Tam, Arman Amirzhan and\nChloe Kirkpatrick all flew solo for the\nfirst time having started from scratch\nat the beginning of the year! Training\nflights cost as little as \u00a37 and we run\ntrips both days of every weekend\nduring term time. We have our own\nfleet of high performance gliders, as\nwell as access to great instructors and\nfacilities at Lasham airfield, home of\nthe largest gliding club in the world.\nWe also organise Winter and Easter\ntours to other sites around the UK and\nEurope.\nIf you would like to find out more\nand have a go yourself, come and\nfind us at Freshers Fair (we are the\nclub with the giant plane) or come\nand meet us at the Union on Friday\nlunchtimes!\nFeeling Immortal this year?\nAmerican Football is fast becoming a hugely popular\nsport in the UK because of its exciting nature,big\nhits and show-stopping touchdowns\u2013with their\naccompanying dances.\nThe Imperial Immortals are Imperial\u2019s own\nAmerican Football team and are made up of existing\nundergraduate and postgraduate students,coached\nby nine knowledgeable and experienced coaches. Last\nseason we remained undefeated throughout the regular\nseason: winning the London conference,promoting us\nto the Premiership South,and taking us to the national\nplay-offs where we won two further games to reach the\nNational Semi-Final.\nThe team has lots of slots for Freshers to come and\nmake an instant impact in the most competitive\nUniversity American Football League in the South.\nAll this talk of sport and success doesn\u2019t mean to say\nthat we don\u2019t socialise together; we are always at the\nUnion on a Wednesday for Sports Night and hold socials\nthroughout the year,often with the Imperial Titans\u2013the\ncheerleading team.\nIf you want to try a new sport or carry on playing\nAmerican Football,the team is taking part in the\u2018Give it\nA Go\u2019scheme,by holding two Come and Try sessions.The\nfirst will be on Wednesday 8th October at 2pm and the\nsecond on Sunday 12th October.\nNo previous experience is required to attend these\nevents; most of the team had never played before\ncoming to University.\nIf you have any questions or want to talk more about\nthe sport and joining us,then come and speak to us\nat the Freshers Fair where we will have a stall,or join\nthe Imperial College American Football Team 2014\nRecruitment page on Facebook.\nSAM HILL\nPUBLICITY AND RECRUITMENT OFFICER\n\n"

    "content": "18 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n06.10.2014\nEditor Philippa Skett\nFeatures Editor VACANT\nFeatures\nfeatures.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMeet Chris, your friend in welfare\nWelcome! I\u2019m Chris, your Deputy\nPresident (Welfare), and here are\nsome tips to make the most of your\ntime in London while also looking\nafter yourself. At times the first term\nwill feel like being hit by a breeze-block in the night. Life at Imperial is\nintense, with many different academ-ic, societal and social pursuits requiring your time \u2013 but it is important to\nremember that we need to find the\nright balance for us. Achieving this\nbalance is vital to maintaining your\nwellbeing and looking after yourself!\nFood\nDuring Freshers\u2019 Week your diet may\nconsist broadly of burgers, kebabs and\nthe like. That\u2019s entirely understand-able, but it is also important to remember that when your studies start,\nyour diet can have a big effect on your\nability to focus and concentrate. A\ngood diet also makes you look and\nfeel good! Cooking isn\u2019t that hard, and\nthe Food Section often carries some\neasy recipes to enjoy. There are also\nmany healthy options on Campus.\nHomesickness\nIt\u2019s normal to feel homesick, especially if you\u2019ve moved country to\nstudy here. But everyone, even if they\ndon\u2019t show it, will be feeling the same\nway. Just power through and make\nthe most of the social opportunities\nprovided at the start of term.\nNightlife Safety\nLondon has some of the most varied\nnightlife in the world, with all sorts of\ndifferent experiences to\nbe had. Here are some pro-tips if\nyou\u2019re going out for a night on the\ntown:\n\u2022 Know your route home before\nyou go. There\u2019s nothing worse\nthan being stuck in the middle of\nLondon, with a flat (or missing!)\nphone and no idea how to get\nback.\n\u2022 If you are drinking alcohol, try\nto pace yourself. Alternating\nbetween alcoholic and non-alco-holic drinks is a good idea.\nChris Kaye\u2019s job is to care for your welfare. Here\u2019s his tips.\n\u2022 Pre-drinking is common and\n(let\u2019s face it) fun. However you\nshouldn\u2019t feel peer pressured\ninto drinking something you\ndon\u2019t want to!\n\u2022 Don\u2019t leave your drink unattend-ed. You never know what people\nmight put in it. Equally don\u2019t\naccept a drink from strangers;\nalways watch your drink being\nmade.\n\u2022 Drugs and alcohol do not mix.\nAnd even if you\u2019re not drinking,\nnever buy drugs in a club.\n\u2022 Be wary of clubs offering special\npromotions to women. Not just\nbecause it violates the Union\u2019s\nequality policy(!) but also because\na club that sees women in that\nway probably isn\u2019t a very nice\nenvironment.\n\u2022 Look after your friends. Travel\nthere and back in a group, and\ndon\u2019t just disappear without\ntelling them. Decide amongst\nyourselves before you head out\nwhat happens if one of you \u2018pulls\u2019\nand who will travel back with\nwhom in that situation.\n\u2022 Never use unlicensed minicabs.\nPre-book your ride from a reputable firm. Worst case scenario if\neverything goes wrong, just pay\nfor a black cab home. At least\nyou\u2019re safe.\n\u2022 Dress appropriately. Not just for\nthe variable London weather,\nbut walking home from central\nLondon is no fun in heels (or so\nI\u2019m told)!\nSafe Sex\nIn the event you have sexual intercourse while at Imperial, it\u2019s important to remember to use protection\nagainst Sexually Transmitted Infections. If you do have unprotected sex\nand require emergency contraception\nor if you would like to get tested for\nan STI then visit the Imperial Health\nCentre or Earl\u2019s Court Health and\nWellbeing Centre. The Union gives\nout free condoms and look out for our\nShag Week and our STI clinics held\nthroughout the year.\nSleep\nThere\u2019s no shame in occasionally having a night in, in fact good sleep patterns are crucial to your health. Also,\nif you\u2019re absolutely knackered it\u2019s\nrather difficult to enjoy social events.\nIt\u2019s a good opportunity to get to know\npeople in halls, maybe watch a film\nor shoot some pool. Also, on Monday\n13th October, the Union is holding an\nevent called Dri, an alcohol-free night\nwith entertainment (featuring a rodeo\nbull!) and a DJ. Open to all.\nDrugs\nRealistically we know some of you\nwill choose to take drugs, and the\nUnion provides access to non-judge-mental information about drugs,\nwhat precautions to take, and what\nto do in case of emergency. As well\nas your safety, it is also important to\nconsider the serious implications of\nbeing found with drugs, particularly\non College grounds. Visit the Union\nwebsite for more information.\nBroaden your education and enhance your potential\nFind out more:\nwww.imperial.ac.uk/horizons\nOn-line enrolment for first years is open throughout Welcome Week.\nMake sure you enrol by 2.00pm on Monday 13th October\n\n"

The South Kensington Campus is transformed into a showcase of\nevery Club, Society and Project that we have on offer at Imperial College Union.\nIt is a fantastic environment to find out exactly what we have going on, as well as\ngrabbing some freebies and soaking up the atmosphere. Every year thousands of\nstudents attend the fair, visiting many of the 320+ stalls that each Club, Society &\nProject get to promote their group, hold demonstrations, give out freebies and chat\nto students.\nStalls are roughly grouped by type so you\u2019ll be able to find any groups associated\nwith a particular interest all in one place, though of course I\u2019d strongly suggest you\ndon\u2019t just visit the one group you might be interested in. There is a huge range of\nactivities on offer and University is the best time to try new things and meet new\npeople. We\u2019re really proud of the diversity and dedication of our student groups and\nwe\u2019d encourage you to take part in as much as you possibly can.\nAs well as the stalls there will be demos and performances on throughout the day,\njust check out the Queens Lawn, Union Gym, Metric, and the Great Hall to look for\nthese. There will also be hourly tours of the newly redeveloped Media Basement\nmeeting in Beit Quad.

Photo: Wikipedia/IncredibleHunk\nBestival is full of wonders and delights\nthat many try to copy but most fail\nto emulate. Curated by DJ Rob da\nBank, and set in the hills of the Isle of\nWight, it is simply a giant playground\nfor overgrown kids, with a balloon-stuffed tent for playing in, a giant\nWishing Tree for climbing, and an\ninflatable church to get married in. It\nsimply has to be seen to be believed\nand even in my fourth year of going,\nthe numerous wonders dotted around\nRobin Hill Country Park never fail to\ndelight.\nThe theme for this years fest\nwas Desert Island Disco and the\npartygoers didn\u2019t disappoint with\ndisco balls, leggings and neon in\nabundance.\nMusic started on the Thursday\nevening with weary festival goers\nhaving made the trip from the\nmainland across the Solent on a fleet\nof ferries to the island, rejuvenated by\nthe buzz and excitement of the few\ndays ahead.\nThe highlight of the first night was\nsurely Jackmaster & Oneman on the\nunbelievable Red Bull stage new to\nthe festival for this year kicking the\nweekend off in style.\nOn Friday the ever popular\nDisclosure whose achievements seem\nto be going from strength to strength\nwere joined on stage by surprise acts\nEliza Doolittle and Sam Smith\nwowed the crowd with their energetic\nset and massive anthems including\n\u2018White Noise\u2019 and \u2018You and Me\u2019.\nOutkast were the most questionable\nheadliner of the weekend with the\nwhole crowd waiting for the hits and\nseemingly humming and swaying\nalong, whilst waiting for without\ndoubt their one banger \u2018Hey-Ya\u2019 that\nbrought hysteria amongst remaining\ncrowd and didn\u2019t disappoint.\nSaturday\u2019s disco theme was truly\nembraced by Sophie Ellis-Bexter\nwho entertained the main stage crowd\nin the daytime sun. The set started\noff quite slow with SEB pushing her\nnew album Wanderlust but she didn\u2019t\ndisappoint later on and after her\nswift wardrobe change into a hula\nskirt and gold swim suit number out\ncame the classics, with \u2018Murder on\nthe Dancefloor\u2019 receiving one of the\nlargest cheers of the weekend.\nSunday at Bestival was brought to a\nclose by Chic featuring an emotional\nNile Rodgers, and their utterly\nmagnificent Desert Island Disco\nfinale set. Emotional and predictably\nnext level, it was brimming with a\npantheon of the greatest hits that\nhave benefitted from Nile\u2019s golden\ntouch, brought to a close under the\nworlds largest disco ball (10.33m\nin diameter) and a beautiful set of\nfireworks.\nA personal highlight of mine was\nthe surprise gig by a small band\nOur Top 5 alternative nights out in London\nGRACE RAHMAN\nMUSIC EDITOR\nFor when the thought of another\nevening negotiating the sticky\ncorridors of Piccadilly Institute is\nenough to turn your stomach. The\nprices below rely on you flashing that\nImperial student card. Flash away.\nWednesday/Fridays/Saturdays @\nNotting Hill Arts Club \u2013 This trendy\nWest London spot is so close to\nSouth Kensington, it\u2019d be rude not to.\nTucked under a Mexican restaurant\non the high street, the line that\nmarks its entrance is usually just\nfor show and moves pretty quickly.\nThis place has a cosy, house-party\nvibe but a London superclub it ain\u2019t.\npreviously unknown to me, AW\nn-Bomb. Lead by a mesmerizing\nfemale vocalist who wowed a tiny\ncrowd in and around The Port on the\nSaturday night \u2013 this unknown act\nthat I stumbled upon caused utter\neuphoria amongst a small group\nof festival-goers and is again one\nof the great wonders which will no\ndoubt force me back to the island for\nanother year of Bestival fun.\nFor me Bestival was the perfect\nclose to a great musical summer and\nI cannot wait for the 12th instalment\nnext year.\nWednesdays attract an arty student\ncrowd, and there are often live acts,\nso it\u2019s worth checking the website\nbeforehand (Notting Hill Gate \u00a38).\nItchy Feet @ Concrete/Proud \u2013\nThis long established night graces\nuniversity towns up and down the\ncountry and is famed for its no frills\napproach. If the prospect of endless\nDavid Guetta doesn\u2019t get your engine\ngoing, the Itchy Feet DJs promise\nska, swing and rock n roll all night.\nGo to the weekly night in Camden\nor the monthly big daddy event in\nShoreditch (Concrete \u2013 Shoreditch\nHigh Street \u00a37 adv/ Proud Camden\nTown \u00a36 adv).\nWhirl-y-gig @ Crucifix Lane \u2013 Not\nfor the faint-hearted, this monthly\nnight has been going for years and\nalways has an army of loyal ravers\nin attendance. For this reason, it\u2019s\nworth booking online to avoid the\nmammoth queue that starts forming\nat ten o\u2019clock. But it\u2019s worth it. Expect\nhours of sweaty dancing to friendly\nD&B and psychedelic trance, 2am\nepiphanies and friends for life. We\nappreciate this sounds awful but,\nbathed in that much trippy lighting,it\nall kind of makes sense (London Bridge\n\u00a312 otd / \u00a316 adv).\nClub NME @ KOKO \u2013 Often a\nchance to catch the latest NME\ndarlings before they make it big\n(Kaiser Chiefs, of all people, opened\nit back in 2004).\nThis student-filled affair is often\nmessy and always packed. When\nthe band finishes sing-a-long indie\nplays and hipsters go on the pull\n(Mornington Crescent \u00a34).\nRegression Sessions \u2013 If you find\nyourself mourning the lack of bouncy\ncastles and face paint down at Boujis,\nthis party might be right up your\nstreet. Usually at Electrowerkz in\nIslington, with its kitsch decor and\nhollowed out tube train bar, these\nfolks pride themselves on their\ncombination of good music and\nstudent-friendly novelties to ease\nthe socialising. A fun night serving\na younger crowd, regression sessions\nnever disappoints (Angel \u00a35 early\nrelease).\nDo not worry, there is a world beyond Metric; if you dare seek it.

The man, who produced\na set of keys for Beit Hall upon\nrequesting a drink at the bar, was\nspotted by another guest who thought\nhe looked strikingly similar to a\nknown con man, who has been on the\nrun since 2010.\nUpon recognising the man, the\nguest called the police who arrived\non the scene, and then proceeded to\ninterview the bar staff. The man had,\nin the meantime, left the premises.\nHis whereabouts are now unknown\n[at time of print], although the police\nsaid the con man that the man is\nsuspected to be was \u201cNot dangerous.\u201d\nThe guest was attending a private\nevent at the time held in the Union\nBar, and reportedly identified the con\nman due to the similarities they had\nin appearance, including a full sleeve\nof tattoos of similar patterning.\nThe con man in question has been\nknown to use several aliases, so it is\nuncertain from the Beit residential\nrecords if he is the man who is wanted\nby police.\nPlabon Saha, who was working at\nthe bar at the time, was interviewed\nby the police, although it is uncertain\nwho served the man and if he was\nindeed the criminal wanted by\nDevonshire and Cornwall police.\nMr Saha was advised to call 999\nshould the man return. Bar managers\nwere unavailable for comment.\nImperial\u2019s first President (and\nsixteeth head), Professor Alice Gast,\nwas instated on the first of September,\nfollowing the retirement of Sir Keith\nO\u2019Nions. Professor Gast will lead the\nCollege\u2019s strategy to develop Imperial\nWest, alongside strengthening the\nCollege\u2019s links to the government,\nindustry, philanthropists and alumni.\nProfessor Gast comes from Lehigh\nUniversity, USA, where she president.\nShe also was a former Vice President\nfor Research and an Associate Provost\nat MIT.\nWhilst at Lehigh, Professor Gast\noversaw a 47% increase in the size\nof the Lehigh estate, making her a\nperfect candidate to help with the\nexpansion of Imperial College and its\nsatellite campuses. She also concluded\na $500 million fundraising campaign,\nand raised an additional $255 million\nduring her time at MIT.\nHer appointment marks the\ncompletion of restructure to the\nsenior roles that oversee the College.\nWhereas the Rector\u2019s remit was to\noversee academic and administrative\naffairs, and chair the Management\nBoard and Senate, as President,\nProfessor Gast will work alongside\nProfessor James Stirling, the recently\nappointed Provost, and will focus\nmore on Imperial\u2019s external affairs.\nThe Provost reports directly to the\nPresident.\nFelix\u2019s interview with Professor\nGast will be printed in next week\u2019s\nissue.\nShe also\nconcluded a\n$500 million\nfundraising\ncampaign\nImperial bounces up\nand down in worldwide\nrankings\nImperial has increased its standing\nin the Times Higher Education\n(THE) World Rankings 2015, rising\nfrom 10th to 9th worldwide, and\nonly second to Oxbridge and US\nuniversities. The news comes in the\nwake of the QS World University\nRatings, in which Imperial was\nranked second equal with Cambridge,\nwith a total score of 87.5.\nThe THE Survey operates on 13\nperformance indicators, grouped into\nfive areas; and research, teaching and\ncitations comprise 90% of the overall\nranking.\nSurprisingly, given its reputation\namong undergraduates, Imperial\ncame out strongly in teaching, with\na score of 84.5, also scoring highly in\nresearch (88.3), international outlook\n(92.7) and citations (89.4). The scores\nare measures of probability \u2013 so a\nscore of 87.5 in a single category\nmeans that the data point of a\nrandomly chosen institution will fall\nbelow Imperial\u2019s 87.5% of the time.\nMore worryingly, the majority of\nUK universities have slipped down\nthe league tables, including Oxford\nand other London universities.\nBoth Phil Baty and John O\u2019Leary,\nrespective editors of the THE and\nQS rankings, blame inadequate\nUK public funding, and warn that\nthe UK\u2019s leading position might\nslip as universities in Asia and the\ndeveloping world climb steadily\nup the rankings. Still, Reading\nUniversity Vice-Chancellor Sir David\nBell seemed not to be worried.\n\"One cannot read too much into a\nsingle year's rankings. Global league\ntables are highly volatile indicators.\nThe fact that some UK universities\nhave risen and fallen up to almost 40\nplaces year-on-year shows it is much\nmore important to look at longer-term trends over time.\"\nThis is borne out by THE Rankings\nfrom previous years, in which\nImperial has been consistently\nranked between 8th and 10th \u2013\nindeed, Imperial\u2019s scores have barely\nshifted from last year. The drop from\n8th appears to correlate with a fall in\nindustry income in 2013-14.\nTo break down results by\ndepartment, medics can feel a certain\nsatisfaction in being 4th worldwide\nfor Clinical, Pre-Clinical and Health,\nwith Engineering and Technology\ncoming in at 6th. Life Sciences and\nPhysical Sciences placed at 10th and\n12th respectively.\nThe\nmajority\nof UK\nuniversities\nhave\nslipped\ndown the\nleague\ntables\nBEN HOWITT\nNEWS WRITER\nInnocent\nbystanders\nattempted\nto rescue\nhundreds\nof books\nANNINA SARTOR\nNEWS WRITER\nScience Fiction library\ndamaged by flooding\nLast Friday, a leak in a Beit Hall\nwater pipe caused water damage to the\nImperial College Science Fiction and\nFantasy library in the Union West\nBasement. Dripping noises could\nfirst be heard from the ceiling in the\nearly afternoon, and over the course\nof two hours, several ceiling tiles were\nsoaked through and fell onto the floor\nbelow as society members, union\nemployees, and innocent bystanders\nattempted to rescue hundreds of\nbooks stored in shelves underneath\nthe affected area. Union employees\nseemed apologetic and understanding\nof the need to get the problem fixed.\nSome book stock was water damaged.\nThere is so far no evidence of more\nextensive damage to the room beyond\nthe ceiling tiles and the now-soaked\ncarpet (which was due to be replaced\nthis summer), or damage in any other\nWest Basement rooms.\nA similar, but smaller, leak had\noccurred the day before, originating\nfrom the same Beit Hall room.\nThis leak was quickly fixed and the\ndamaged ceiling tiles replaced by\nearly Friday morning. Water damage\nin the library has occurred in the\npast, and while the Union had fixed\nup the damaged ceiling over the\nsummer as part of the West Basement\nrefurbishments, the leaking problem\nseems to not yet have been fully\nresolved. Talks regarding more\npermanent solutions are in progress.\nICSF hopes to regain use of the space\nin time for Fresher\u2019s Fair.\nTraumatic scenes unfolding in the West Basment.\nPhoto: Sci-Fi society\n\n"

This road is a particular favourite of Top Gear.\nPhoto: ICAB\nImperial College Aid to the Balkans on their work with underprivileged children\nIn June 2014, five of us from Imperial\nCollege London represented Imperial\nCollege Aid to the Balkans (ICAB) on\na volunteer program in Bulgaria at a\ntown called Gorna Oryahovitsa.\nICAB supports orphanages and\nday centres for children in Bulgaria.\nWe worked at one such day centre\nin Gorna, which provides social\nand developmental support for\nall children, including those with\ndisabilities, whilst the parents are at\nwork.\nWe worked with two groups of\nchildren: one group with severely\nnotable disabilities such as cerebral\npalsy and the other with mild\ndisabilities such as ADHD.\nThe day centre was impressive with\na functioning gym and playground,\nbut the children lacked playmates\nand the caretakers didn\u2019t have much\ntime to play with them. Hence\nour primary role and focus was on\nproviding the children with much-needed attention through activities\nwhich stimulated and engaged their\ninterests and development. We\ncouldn\u2019t communicate verbally due\nto the language barrier, but using\nactions with sincerity, the team\nforged strong friendships with the\nchildren.\nWith time, we better understood\nthe children and were able to\nadjust our games to increase their\nenjoyment.\nEach day the kids played with\nsomething new such as balls, frisbees\nand bubbles. All of the toys we\nbought were funded by the \u00a380 we\nraised through a cake sale we held\nat Imperial. On two of the days we\ndrew the children\u2019s silhouette and let\nthem colour it, which was planned\nby two local volunteers who did us a\nbig favour in terms of the language\nbarrier. We helped children with\nwalking difficulties to walk and on\nour last day, we organized a mini\nparty with face paints and balloon\nsculptures to conclude our time with\nthem. The kids really enjoyed it!\nOn our first free weekend, we went\nto neighbouring Romania to visit a\nfew castles in Transylvania, including\nDracula\u2019s very own! To experience the\nwild Transylvanian scenery, we drove\nalong the Transfagarasan, named\nby Top Gear as the most beautiful\nroad in the world - imagine driving\nthrough a flock of sheep and having\nlunch by a glacial lake in heavy snow\n(in June) !\nThe following weekend we went\nto Varna, a city by the Black Sea,\nto soak up all the sunshine we\nmissed in London. We also went to\nBulgaria\u2019s most celebrated tourist\nattraction, Rila monastery, nestled\nin the mountains, to admire the\nbest of Bulgarian art, culture and\narchitecture. These are places\nwhere lovers of nature, culture and\nadventure will all have an amazing\ntime like we did.\nOur time in Bulgaria was truly an\neye opening experience. It allowed\nus to view the world in a different\nlight and further understand the\nplight of the unfortunate. It also gave\nus a better insight into the history\nof the country and of how Bulgaria\nhas transformed throughout the\nyears. This was certainly a journey of\nself-discovery and our way of giving\nback to the community through\ninteraction with the locals.\nICAB strongly supports the\ndevelopment of both its volunteers\nand the target community and we\nwould highly recommend anyone\ninterested in giving back to the\ncommunity to take up this program.\nOne of the day care centres visited by Imperial College Aid to the Balkans.

Many of you may have heard\nof this for the first time recently,\nbut alongside the lucrative banking\nand finance industry, big bucks are\nnow coming to consulting. And it\nshouldn\u2019t come as a surprise because\nsome of the biggest real world\nproblems are solved by consultancies.\nIn 2013, the UK Management\nConsultancies Association (MCA)\nreported an 8% annual growth in the\nconsulting sector, beating most other\nkey industries. As more companies\nturn to consultancies for solutions to\ntheir problems, it is with no surprise\nConsulting the students of Imperial\nthat this industry is set to grow, by\nhelping the other industries grow.\nYou might still be puzzled as to\nexactly what consulting is. Let\u2019s\nassume we have a problem. Your firm\nwants to launch a new product but\ndo not know how to. As the boss of\nthe company, there would be many\nquestions running through your\nmind \u2013 how much are you going to\nprice it, where are you going to make\nthe product available, and the list\ngoes on. You can get the answers to\nthese questions by randomly finding\na figure or answer and wish upon\nall your luck that you got it right, or\nyou could find the answer through\na systematic, analytical and logical\nmethod of surveying, benchmarking\nand obtaining a good strategy with\nprojections. That is what consultants\ndo: providing answers to problems\nand questions through a scientific,\nmethodological and quantifiable\napproach.\nAs a consultant, you help firms\nsave millions of dollars, build\ncompetencies in clients, and make\na positive difference that lasts.\nEvery project you work on would be\ndifferent, and while your job gets\nfilled with vibrancy, you get a strong\nsense of fulfilment too from all the\npositive difference that you have\ncreated.\nFor everyone in Imperial who is\nkeen to join this exciting industry, the\nImperial College Consultancy Society\n(ICCS) would be your leading student-led organisation that not just provides\nyou a touch-point to the industry, but\nplatforms for you to gain valuable\nskills and competencies. Here at ICCS,\nour primary goal is to help every\nmember to our fullest extent achieve\ntheir ambitions towards a career in\nconsultancy.\nWe hold a variety of events where\nwe bring to campus top notch\nconsulting firms \u2013 opportunities for\nyou to learn about them, as well as to\ncreate networks that might one day be\nuseful for your future endeavours.\nIf you are looking for more than\njust learning about consulting firms,\nthen join our in-house Case Study\nClub, or even our subsidiary, the\nImperial Consulting Group (ICG),\nwhere you will get an opportunity\nto hone your analytical skills and\nlogical reasoning. ICG even offers\nyou real life opportunities to work\nwith established clients solving real\nproblems.\nThere is so much you can expect\nin consulting, because at every\npoint, it changes. The most difficult\nchallenges are structured and solved\nby consultancies. If you are keen to\nlearn more about consulting, or wish\nto prepare yourself for a career in\nconsulting, ICCS will be a must-join.\nPurchase our free membership from\nthe Imperial College Union website\nand you would be entitled to attend\nour career presentations, as well as\nenrichment activities, for free.\nFor more information, we welcome\nyou to visit us at our stand at the\nFreshers\u2019 Fair.\nYANN CHEN\nICCS PRESIDENT\nAs a Fresher you will quickly realise\nthat University is an amazing time\nto make friends and experience\nnew things, especially in a city like\nLondon. It is also a perfect time to\nstart thinking about how you can\nmake a mark on the world around\nyou.\nSadly as students we can often be\nportrayed in a bad light in the media,\nhowever things are quickly changing\nas University students everywhere\nare proving that they have the power\nand potential to shape a better world.\nRecently an edible water bottle\ndesigned to reduce plastic waste was\nshortlisted as one of five ideas that\ncould radically change the world.\nIt was a student at Imperial who\ndesigned it.\nImperial Hub is a community\nof students working to create\nopportunities for others to make a\ndifference. Throughout Welcome\nWeek we want you to think about\nhow you will Make Your Mark and\ndrive positive social change whilst at\nImperial. Whether you can imagine\nyourself inspiring young school\nstudents, using your tech skills to\nhelp charities with web design or even\nstarting your own social enterprise,\nthere will be something that you can\ndo to get involved!\nYou might not realise it, but the\nopportunity to effect change is right\nat your fingertips. While Kensington\nand Chelsea seems on the surface an\nextremely affluent area, it actually\nfaces huge social inequalities and has\nthe biggest gap between high and low\nearners in London. 35%of primary\nschool students in the borough are\non Free Schools Meals (because their\nparents have a combined income of\nless than \u00a315,190) compared to the\nnational average of 19%.\nStudents at Imperial have been\nengaging with these issues and other\nsimilar ones throughout London\nthrough various ways with Imperial\nHub.\nLast year over 100 Schools Plus\ntutors were able to inspire and engage\nover 450 disadvantaged school pupils\nacross London, helping to improve\nresults and bridge gaps between\nschool and university.\nThis year we are pleased to\nannounce that the Schools Plus\ntutoring programme will be\ngrowing even bigger and better\nas we merge with the Pimlico\nConnection and Imperial College\u2019s\nOutreach Department. One of our\npast volunteers said: \u201cI've gained\nso many amazing experiences and\nskills...

In the\ncase of alcohol, not only is the drinker\nharmed, but substantial harms to all\nothers involved occur. Street violence,\ndomestic abuse and child abuse are\ncommon, unmanageable by-products\nof the drug.\nAlcohol and its mind altering\neffects have comparable harms\nto more sinister substances that\nthe government bans already.\nThe ethereal state, our governing\nbody, has obvious obligations to its\nvoter base, and to the principles of\ndemocracy. Yes, state obligations,\nwhat a nice thought.\nThat said, arguably the most\nimportant role of the state is to\nprotect its citizens. Legislation exists\nto ban drugs which have comparable\neffects to alcohol. Why? Because the\ngovernment recognises the harms\nthat come with their legalisation.\nThis is particularly important when\nconsidering how deeply ingrained\nalcohol is within British culture.\nPublic awareness campaigns are\nfailing. Higher taxation is simply\nforcing the market to retarget its\nefforts. Alcohol is as it always has\nbeen: a romanticised pleasure.\nClearly, something more drastic must\nbe done.\nThe widespread cultural\nimportance of alcohol makes this\nban a controversial one. However,\nit is also one that legitimises the\nharms of alcohol. One of the primary\ndangers of alcohol is that people\ndo not view it as a particularly\nharmful substance. This is even more\nproblematic because people tend to\ndrink alcohol passively. What do we\nmean \u2018passively\u2019? Well, having half\na bottle of wine with dinner, or a\ncouple of cans of lager watching the\ntelly every night and not realising\nthe risks. It\u2019s having a \u2018little tipple\u2019\nthat sometimes goes too far. People\nbecome dependent on their drinks\nwithout even realising it.\nBecause people are unaware of\nthe long term effects of alcohol, the\nnumber of people suffering from\nliver disease has risen sharply. The\nNHS reported recently that, in the\nlast decade, hospitalisation due to\nliver illness has risen by 25%. The\ngovernment is taking a non-serious\nstance to alcohol. When damning\nhealth reports are arising, this stance\nimplies that alcohol is an acceptable\ndrug.\nBy banning the sale and\ndistribution of alcohol, the state says\nto its constituents that alcohol is a\nserious risk to their health. But what\ndoes this actually mean? People feel,\nen masse, that breaking the law is\nsomething negative. For the most\npart, breaking the law makes people\nfeel unsafe. When this is the case,\npeople are far less likely to take steps\nto obtain alcohol illegally.\nFurthermore, when alcohol is so\ntaboo, it hits hardest the youngest\ngenerations of upcoming drinkers.\nWhen the drug is difficult to acquire,\nand illegal to obtain, people become\nless likely to obtain it.\nConsidering that the group in\nsociety with the largest likelihood\nof alcoholism, the largest chance of\nsuffering chronic liver disease, is\nthe 16-25 age category, it seems like\ntargeting their perception of alcohol\nis crucial.\nWhile it\u2019s probably correct to say\nthat the state exists to protect its\nconstituents, it is foolish to ignore\nthe frankly appalling consequences\nof a total ban on alcohol. There are\nobvious reasons why there is such a\nbig difference between the treatment\nof alcohol and other banned\nsubstances.\nAlcohol is a drug that is easily\nbrewed. It is easy to procure alcohol,\nbut difficult to procure alcohol of\ngood quality. Finally, when alcohol\nwas banned in the Manhattan\nprohibition, ten thousand people fell\nvictim to severe alcohol poisoning by\ndrinking impure alcohol.\nWhen alcohol is banned, people\nlook to cheaper, more secretive ways\nof brewing and distributing alcohol\nfor the consumer market. This has a\nnumber of effects.\nThe first is that the alcohol\nproduced tends to be of far lower\ngrade, produced from cheaper and\nmore innocuous materials such as\ntypes of wood. This alcohol tends\nto be the sort that causes the sort of\nbodily harm mentioned previously.\nYou\u2019re scientists and hence can\nprobably discern that drinking\nmethanol produced from wood or\ndistilled from solvents is not the best\nidea for your liver.\nSecondly, even when it isn\u2019t of a\nlow grade, it\u2019s not possible to mass\nproduce and distribute good quality\nliquor by yourself. The nature of\nproduction and distribution has\nto become secretive. To secretly\ndistribute alcohol in quantity\nrequires a very concerted and\norganised effort. This tends to\nmanifest itself in organised crime\nstructures. Needless to say, groups of\norganised criminal hierarchies are\nharmful both to the people involved\nin them, and to the neighbourhoods\nin which they reside.\nThirdly, it pushes the culture of\ndrinking itself underground. To say\n\u2018banning alcohol means that people\nwon\u2019t drink it\u2019 is a simplistic view of\nboth people, and the role of alcohol\nwithin our society. Many people use\nalcohol as a tool for social interaction\nand it features prominently in their\nlives. Moreover, people are already\naware that alcohol is bad for them.\nReally though, people appreciate\nautonomy over their own bodies: they\nwant to be responsible for their own\nlives.\nWhen people feel infantilised, they\nresent the state for babying them. In\nthis case, people are likely to continue\nwanting to drink. While this means\nthat some people get lower grade\nalcohol from shadier sources, a ban\nwould have a particularly profound\neffect on the people that are most\ndesperately in need of state help and\ncare: those severely dependent on\nalcohol.\nIt is obvious that there is still a\nmarket for alcohol under the ban. If\npeople continue to drink, the harms\nassociated with alcoholism still exist.\nThere is one crucial effect here, and\nthat is that people are unwilling to\nseek help for alcohol addiction; they\nare unwilling to engage with hospitals\nand support staff when they suffer\nfrom alcohol related problems. This\nis obviously bad. Why? Because all of\nthe alcohol related problems which\nexist within our society already are\nmade worse when people cannot\nseek out help. When people do not\nfeel that the state can provide the\nsanctuary that they need, they do\nnot feel protected. Rather, they feel\nvictimised and helpless: a truly awful\nconsequence.\n\"Alcohol is\nas it always\nhas been: a\nromanticised\npleasure.\"\n\"When\npeople feel\ninfantilised,\nthey resent\nthe state\nfor babying\nthem.\"\nYES NO\nThe app for students featuring College information,\nUnion news, course timetables and much more.\nLatest features include department computer availability,\nLibrary account information and classroom clicker.\nImperialMobile\nDownload\n\u2192 www.imperial.ac.uk/imperialmobile\n\n"

Some of them have even been revising for their diagnostic tests we have in the first week. I haven\u2019t. OMG\u2026What if I fail? Will they kick me out? I\u2019m going to email\nmy department to make sure. Then post about me emailing my department in the Freshers Group, just so everyone there knows I\u2019ve emailed my department.\nSaturday 6th October, 2014\nDear Diary,\nI\u2019m sitting in my new room at Imperial College London and I am so excited! Or, wait\u2026 is it called Imperial? Or just ICL? Who knows! Maybe I should ask the people on the fresher\u2019s Facebook\ngroup. I am currently unpacking, and skyping my mother just to make sure she got back to Croydon ok. I am also going to skype my new girlfriend later, she keeps missing my calls since\nshe started at Newcastle, I am sure she is just really busy. I\u2019m worried about having a roommate because a) they haven\u2019t shown up and 2) I am worried they are going to be cooler than\nme, as I brought my Spiderman duvet (original artwork) to be cool but now it seems stupid.

I reckon I had, maybe 3 whole pints of these purple snakekiss things, and even managed 1 and half J\u00fcngfrau bombs after too!\nLast night was absolutely mental though, I got so drunk at one point I thought those weird pictures of the people and the triangles were moving. One of them literally produced a triangle\nout of thin air, maybe someone spiked my drink lol! I am going to have breakfast with people in my corridor later. We did predrinks last night and played never have I ever. Someone said\n\u201cnever have I ever had sex\u201d. It was literally the first question. Everyone looked awkward than drank. Then I drank too, even though I haven\u2019t. I really think I\u2019ve bonded with everyone on\nmy corridor. It\u2019s only been like one day but it\u2019s crazy how quickly friendships form when you live with people so closely, you know? Roommate still hasn\u2019t shown up.\nMonday 8th October, 2014\n\n"

No.\nWhat we\u2019ve seen over the last few\nyears is merely a warm up to the\nmain event. Over the coming year\nwe could, in fact, be seeing one of the\nmost dramatic changes to the British\npolitical landscape in our lives. David\nCameron doesn\u2019t seem to be going\nback on his promise for extra powers\nto Scotland, but he\u2019s now introduced\nsomething else to the equation: The\npossibility of an English Parliament.\nSince then, Number 10 has stressed\nthat one is not conditional on the\nother, but Cameron has already\nprovided a major insight into the\nway he is thinking on this issue. And\nthe referendum has only served to\naugment concerns about a certain\nanomaly in the way that Parliament\nworks. Due to the devolved Scottish\nparliament English MPs can\u2019t vote on\nScottish matters, such as education and\nhealth. This makes sense \u2013 why should\nan MP from the south of Cornwall be\nallowed to vote on the education of a\nteenager from the Shetland Islands?\nHowever, the sense ends when\nwe consider what happens with the\nequivalent English issues. Today 59\nMPs from Scotland can vote on issues,\nsuch as education and health, which\nonly affect England. A good example\nwould be the tuition fees hike, which\ndid not affect Scottish students\nstudying in Scotland. And yet MPs\nfrom Scotland were allowed to decide\nhow much tuition fees would cost for\nan English student in England? It\ndoesn\u2019t sound right.\nSo, from that point of view, an\nEnglish Parliament to mirror those\nof Scotland, Wales, and Northern\nIreland is a logical next step. One\nwould presume (the details are still to\nbe discussed) that any extra powers\nthat go to Scotland, in the interests of\nfairness to all, will also go to devolved\nParliaments in England, Wales, and\nNorthern Ireland. Of course, with\neverything up in the air, that remains\nto be seen, but Cameron, Nick Clegg\nand Ed Miliband will have a lot to\nanswer for from the people of these\nthree nations if they suddenly see more\npowers go solely to Scotland.\nThe theory is that this won\u2019t be\nmuch of an \u201cissue\u201d when it comes to\nthe general election. This is because\nit would appear that there is an\nagreement that the Scotland Bill to be\nannounced next year will be decided\nand agreed upon before the election \u2013\nand by all three parties.\nBut that adds an extra complication \u2013\ntime. There is now a clear deadline for\nthe new Scotland Bill \u2013 the timetable\nthat is set to be laid out says that there\nshould be draft legislation ready for\nthe Scotland Bill during November.\nIt\u2019s a dilemma for David Cameron.\nEd Miliband, seemed to suggest at the\nfirst day of the party conference that\nhe doesn\u2019t think there is much need to\nmake the changes to the English side of\nParliament. Cameron has two options\nnow. He could push for an English\nParliament now and push it through\nin this bill itself. Or he could take\nthe view that he will not be making\nmuch ground in Scotland anyway next\nyear, and use the idea of an English\nParliament as a policy in the election.\nIf he goes for the Parliament before\nthe election, it would take a lot of\nwork, and we\u2019d be seeing Downing\nStreet move incredibly fast to make it\nhappen.\nThis is going to be an exciting year\nfor the onlookers. But don\u2019t be fooled\nby the result. The debate on what\nhappens with Scotland has just begun.\nWhy our league table success masks\nthe real problem\nTHOMAS LIM\nCOMMENT WRITER\nImperial\u2019s surprise jump to joint\nsecond in the QS World Rankings was\na welcome prelude to the academic\nyear. Students and staff alike were\nenergised by the international accolade\n- Facebook feeds were full of links to\nstories about how London had the\nmost top universities of any city, and\nImperial was the crown jewel. I was\nmade the poster student of Imperial;\ninterviewed by The Independent and\nBBC London News as a \u2018case study\u2019 of\na student at Imperial. A fun and good\nexperience for me, but I couldn\u2019t help\nbut get the feeling that the media, and\nCollege were caught up in the hype.\nThe QS ranking takes in to account\nvarious factors, most of which are\nbased around research and academia:\n40% of the weighting is based\non academics\u2019 rankings of other\nuniversities. Another 20% comes\nbased on the number of citations our\nacademics receive (no doubt helped\nby Prof Sir John Pendry\u2019s work, as\nThe Guardian reported). QS awards\n20% of its weightings to the academic\nstudent ratio, on the basis that it is\na \u2018commitment to teaching\u2019. This is\nflawed- surely different universities\nwill demand different amounts of\nteaching from their staff (for one, we\nall know Imperial\u2019s academics won\u2019t\nbe promoted if they aren\u2019t acing their\nresearch, regardless of their teaching).\nQS can\u2019t take in to account student\nsatisfaction, because there is no\nglobal metric or survey which has\nbeen created. So whilst QS\u2019 coverage\nof metrics on academic work is\nsound, the same cannot be said for\ngauging student satisfaction. The\nTHE Student Experience league table\nranked Imperial 43rd. It cannot just\nbe because we work hard here: Oxford\nand Cambridge placed fifth and sixth,\nrespectively.\nFundamentally, an improved\nstudent experience has not caused\nour rankings to improve. Imperial\nhas hired some cracking academics\nwho have pulled up our reputation,\nas well citations. If I wanted to keep\nImperial top of the league tables, I\nwould continue to push its academic\nboundaries and recruit more overseas\nresearch focused staff (another\nmeasure QS takes in to account). But\nthese measures are not in the best\ninterests of its student population.\nWhilst student satisfaction has\nincreased over the last few years, we\ncannot lose sight of the end goal: there\nis a long way to go before Imperial sits\nwith where it rightly should.\nImperial celebrated raising\nover \u00a350m last year in donations.\nCompared to Oxbridge who have\ncelebrated raising over one billion\npounds in recent years, we do seem\nto be trailing behind. Ask most\nstudents on campus what they think\nof Imperial, and you will receive an\napathetic response. They are here\nnow, want to graduate and get a job.\nThey perceive it as a transaction\nrelationship. Currently Imperial has\nnot built an experience which makes\nalumni amenable to donations.\nAn improvement to the student\nexperience and teaching will be key to\nfostering better relations with future\nalumni.\nThe QS results are undoubtedly a\nsource of pride for Imperial, but the\nreal pride for students should come\nwhen we top Student Experience\nleague tables.\nPlease can we make this be a thing?

But the\nNUS nostalgia squad aside, does this\nstill hold true today?\nYoung Britons today are less likely\nto join a political party or Trade\nUnion, less religious than ever before,\nless likely to hold high opinion\nof British Defence (BSA) and are\nless supportive of the welfare state\n(see chart). They are more liberal\non views of gender, sexuality, and\nrace, and also value sustainability\nmore than ever. Young people today\nare environmentally conscious,\nconcerned about the deficit and\naccept capitalism as the norm, having\ngrown up in a post-Soviet, post-Thatcher world. Above all they are\nless collective and value their own\nrights. So, whether they know it or\nnot, many young Britons are indeed\nLibertarians.\nOf course, the term Libertarian\nconjures up images of Sarah Palin and\nRick Perry in cowboy hats, hunting\ndeer with automatic rifles atop a\npipeline in Tar Sands. However, the\nTea Party image has hijacked the\nTerm, which simply implies social\ntolerance, enterprising capitalist\nspirit, and an emphasis on the\nindividual.\nLet\u2019s be clear, we are not comparing\nour views to our parents and\ngrandparents as they are now. (I\u2019m\nsure many of you have elderly\nrelatives who are far from politically\ncorrect and may say the occasional\ncomment to your foreign girlfriend\nthat makes you choke on your roast\npotatoes at Sunday lunch.)\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not a liberal at twenty\nyou have no heart, if you\u2019re not a\nconservative at forty, you have no\nbrain.\u201d\nThese words of Winston Churchill\nseem to encapsulate a long-held truth\nthat we all move to the right as we\nage. Whilst the current standards of\nliberal and conservative have departed\nfrom those that Churchill referred to,\nthe basic idea that each generation\nundergoes a political evolution\nthrough life holds. By comparing the\nattitudes of generations during their\nrespective young lives, a remarkable\nshift in the values of our generation is\nevident.\nThe year 2008 was the first time\nsince records began in which more\nyoung people favoured a tax cut over\nincreased welfare spending (Ipsos\nMori). Furthermore, less than a third\nof \u2018Generation Y\u2019 would class the\ncreation of the welfare state amongst\nthe country\u2019s greatest achievements,\nwhereas in our grandparents\u2019\ngeneration, 71% did.\nOur social attitudes are changing\neven more drastically (for the better,\nif I may add) with just under 10%\nof today\u2019s youth agreeing with the\nstatement \u201chomosexuality is wrong\u201d;\ncompared to 53% of post-war 18-25\nyear olds.\nThe picture is clear: fewer\nresponsibilities for the state and more\nrights for the individual.\nIn turn, this may even explain why\nyoung people are more apathetic\ntowards politics. For example, a\nstudent today who is, say, unsure\nabout the power of Brussels, sceptical\nof high government spending,\nsupportive of the legalisation of\ndrugs and is frustrated by the\ninaction on environmental issues is\nunrepresented by any major UK party.\nThis student could not vote\nConservative on social grounds,\nnor Labour or Green on economic\ngrounds. And no right-minded\nstudent would vote for Judas Clegg\u2019s\nLib Dems or the regressive UKIPs.\nSome people, like Russell Brand,\nput this political apathy down to the\nrise of the reformist left exemplified\nby the Occupy Movement. This may\nbe true in part, but whilst the 2000\nprotesters may have left a mark on\nour minds with their prime location,\nanonymous masks and catchy slogans,\nbarring some impending revolution\none cannot seriously suggest that this\nmovement has claimed the future of\nour political generation.\nBut one man seems to have taken\nadvantage of the rotation of the youth\ntowards the libertarian. Boris Johnson\nis unquestionably in the 1%. In fact,\nhe is probably in the 0.001%, but by\npositioning himself in the socially\nprogressive wing of the conservative\nparty, whilst remaining strongly pro-enterprise and committed to social\nmobility and meritocracy, he appeals\nto young voters.\nDavid Cameron calls Boris his\n\u201cstar player\u201d and perhaps his recently\nscheduled return to Westminster is\na sign that the mainstream parties\nhave finally heeded the \u201cslide to the\n(economic) right\u201d and \u201cstep to the\n(social) left\u201d in the \u201ccha-cha slide\u201d of\nBritain\u2019s Generation Y.\n\"If you're\nnot a Tory\nat forty,\nyou have\nno brain.\"\n\"This\nmay even\nexplain\nwhy young\npeople\nare more\napathetic\ntowards\npolitics.\"\n\"Whether they\nknow it or not,\nmany young\nBritons are indeed\nLibertarians. \"\nGEORGE BUTCHER\nCOMMENT WRITER\nWhy having an opinion in Felix is important\nThis is the Comment Section. As\nthe name suggests, it has many\ncomments, opinions, lies, rants and\ntangents provided by your fellow\nImperial students. You may find\na serious discussion piece on the\nScottish referendum, or you may find\none of my rants about the queuing\nsystem for the Queen\u2019s Tower Rooms\u2019\ncanteen. Either way, as the premier\nforum to get your comment hosted\nonline, printed 4000 times, and quite\nliterally scattered around campus,\nthe comment section is the third best\nbit of Felix (after Hangman and the\ncrossword).\nBut it is the most important section.\nFelix is not controlled by the Union\nor the College. The Rector cannot tell\nus what to print and nor can Tom\n\u201cHis Presidentness\u201d Wheeler. It is\nindependent, and allows the students\nto voice views that either wouldn\u2019t be\nnoticed or would be ignored. We\u2019re\nfortunate enough to be such a diverse\nuniversity that the breadth of views\nis perfect for kick-starting a good\ndebate. Anyone is free to submit\nan article, and the vast majority\nget published. What\u2019s written here\ndoesn\u2019t represent the opinion of the\nEditor, the Union or the College,\npurely the author. There aren\u2019t many\nplaces that write its readers such a\nblank cheque, but Felix does, and it\ndoes so with pride.\nAll too often writing gets associated\nwith the humanities, and yawn, who\nwants to be associated with them?\nNo! It is so much more than an essay\non the inane, or a dissertation on\nthe boring. Nor is this about 140\ncharacter tweets, or click-bait on\nBuzzFeed. We like to think students\nand staff read this for quality, not just\nto see what \u201cthe most amazing thing\nthat happened to me today\u201d is.\nWriting and reading in Felix\nComment is about ideas, discussion,\nrants, comedy, and sheer\nbloodymindedness. Imperial! We\nwant your views, we demand to share\nyour mind\u2019s thoughts, and to gift to\nus what perspectives and experiences\nyou can. So open your laptop, start a\nnew document, and teach us all what\nto think.\n\n"
