Downs, who were hired by Sony in\nApril to get cracking on ideas.\nThe Molyneuxs (not convinced\nthat\u2019s how to pluralise their surname)\nhave previously worked on the likes\nof Bob\u2019s Burgers, with multiple scripts\ncurrently in development (including\nHot Stuff at Dreamworks).\nThe main thrust of the franchise\nis also going strong, with Rodney\nRothman working on a 23 Jump Street,\nand continued mutterings of a Jump\nStreet/Men in Black crossover, which\nSony has been pushing for since the\nsuccess of the sequel.\nThere\u2019s no news on the story or\nany real details for any of the three\nprojects - not yet, anyway.\nSpectre teaser released\nThe latest James Bond film,\nSpectre, got a new teaser trailer\nduring the NBA finals on\nTuesday night, marking the start\nof the steady increase of publicity\nmaterials for the highly-anticipated\nfilm.\nA teaser trailer for the 24th\nfilm in\nthe James Bond franchise made an\nappearance back in March, and the\nfirst half of this new trailer recycles\nmuch of that first glimpse.\nFrom there, it\u2019s a smash-grab of\nsmash-cuts that give tiny glimpses\nof what\u2019s in store for Daniel Craig\u2019s\nBond.\nBen Whishaw\u2019s Q is briefly visible,\nas well as both new Bond girls Lea\nSeydoux and Monica Bellucci. There\u2019s\nalso a shadow-cloaked visit from\nChristoph Waltz\u2019s Franz Oberhauser\n- long rumoured (and denied) to be a\nreincarnation of Ernst Stavro Blofeld,\nthe evil supervillain in charge of the\nshadowy, titular Spectre organisation.\nThe major players from the hit\n23rd\nentry Skyfall are all returning,\nincluding the likes of Ralph\nFiennes as M and Naomie Harris as\nMoneypenny, as well as director Sam\nMendes.\nSpectre\u2019s script has been penned by\nJohn Logan and Neal Purvis & Robert\nWade, the men responsible for much\nof the modern resurgence of Bond.\nSpectre is due for release on\nNovember 6.\nChristoph Waltz looks suitable menacing and shadowy as Franz Oberhauser in the teaser for\nthe newest Bond film.

We\u2019ll return in the\nfirst week of the next term, with a\nnew editor, which will be an exciting\nchange for the paper.\nIn this week\u2019s issue we\u2019ve covered\nthe news of the many mistakes that\nhave been spotted in the Physics\nexams that students have been\nsitting all term. The mistakes range\nfrom missing signs and symbols and\npoorly drawn diagrams, through to\na question that was impossible to\nsolve, and left a lot of students angry,\nalthough perhaps not surprised.\nSpeaking to members of staff in the\ndepartment, it seems there may be a\nflaw in the system as opposed to the\nfault of one individual. Not only that,\nit is probably not a problem unique\nto Physics, but is an issue nonetheless\nwhen factored into the bigger\npicture of perceived apathy towards\nundergraduate students.\nIn the past five(!) years I have\nspent at Imperial, by far the biggest\ncomplaint I have heard from students\nabout this university is not the lack\nof girls, boys, beer or all of the above,\nbut actually the sense of disconnect\nbetween the undergraduate students\nand Imperial itself.\nTypos in exams give an impression\nof a lack of attention towards\nthe exams that students spend\nhours poring over textbooks and\nPowerPoints for. The fact that\nstudents in their undergraduate year\nspend so much time, not to mention\nmoney, in preparing and taking these\nexams, it is all the more annoying\nthat it seems that the university\nhaven\u2019t given the exam the same due\ncare students do.\nNot only that, but sitting exams is\nan experience that can be made all the\nmore stressful if you start to doubt\nyourself over an exam question. No\nmatter how many hours you commit\nto the library as a first year student,\nhaving an exam script with a question\ncontaining an error can turn what\nyou know on its head, as what is\nseemingly more likely to be wrong;\nyour notes or the script?\nStudents aren\u2019t science machines\n(just like the professors that write\nthe exams, obviously), and even if we\nsee a mistake during a test, it takes\nmore than our own confidence in\nour knowledge to speak up and say\nsomething about it.\nThat impossible question may have\nbeen only worth 15% of the marks,\nbut I am sure a greater proportion\nof the students would have worried\nabout on the way home after the\nexam.\nMistakes can contribute to students\nfeeling neglected, as can often be the\ncase when feedback is late or non-existent, or emails go ignored.\nThe Physics department seem\ngenuinely apologetic over the errors,\nand obviously no-one is perfect. I\nhope that their empathy is felt by the\nstudents however, as if they are just\noffered simple scaling or a few extra\nmarks here or there, this feeling of\ndisconnection may continue past\nexams and even after students leave.\n\n"

This year is no\nexception.\nCo-ordinated by Michael CraigMartin CBE, the galleries have taken\non the vivid peacock hues of his\npaintings. The colour experience\nbegins before you\u2019ve even entered\nthe galleries, where Jim Lambie has\ndecanted the London Tube Map\nonto the main staircase, creating\na signature floor installation of\nkaleidoscope-coloured lines in\nvinyl tape that distort the space\nand pulse with pure energy in the\ntraditional Victorian space. The\ngalleries themselves have been\nunconventionally painted in\npaint-box colours: bubblegum pink,\nturquoise, and ultramarine \u2013 it\nshouldn\u2019t work but it does. It has\nraised a few eyebrows, admits head of\nthe Summer Exhibition Edith Davey,\nbut even the sceptics were won\naround in the end. It feels like a true\ncelebration of the art that is stacked\non the walls.\nGiven the colour of the back canvas\nitself, perhaps it is unsurprising\nthat the works that really stand\nout are the ones in monochrome.\nEmma Stibbon\u2019s stark paintings of\nIceland strike a bright note against\nthe brilliance of the walls, with the\ncold Nordic light streaming out from\nthem. Further on, the print room\nis similarly full on monochrome\ngems, and is curated by Norman\nAckroyd, one of the greatest masters\nof the form. Several of his own\nprints hang in the room flanking the\nmain archway alongside some tiny\nTracey Emin animal prints. Emin\u2019s\nwork is unusually restrained: sparse\nlines delineate rabbits and badgers,\nreminiscent more of a modern\nBeatrix Potter than her previous\nwork. The focus is not on these big\nnames however, but rather on bigger\npieces by less well known artists:\nAdaptation by Ade Adesina shows a\nhuge ship sailing through a densely\npopulated city on train tracks; in\nQuestions by the same artist, The Taj\nMahal, St Paul\u2019s, The Parthenon all\nappear in a glorious amalgamation\nof all the world\u2019s most recognisable\nlandmarks whilst a whale flies\nthrough the sky, a zeppelin fashioned\nout of pure whimsy.\nCraig-Martin was determined that\nsculpture should have a prominent\nstage this year, and The Lecture\nHall, is a testament to this ambition.\nOf 118 works exhibited in this\nspace, the majority are sculpture; in\naddition, the halls are punctuated\nwith commanding pieces, such as\nTim Shaw\u2019s Erebus (Man of Fire III)\nwhich makes a lasting impression.\nShaw has conjured up rippling\nmuscles and outstretched limbs\nwith an electrifying presence from\npainted foam, polyethene, and steel.\nOther featured artists include Anish\nKapoor, Geoffrey Clarke, and Neil\nJefferies.\nArchitecture, usually placed\ncentrally, has this year been\nsegregated to the Large Weston\nRoom, which can give the sense of the\nwork being included as somewhat of\nan afterthought. Happily, the room,\ncurated by Ian Ritchie, houses some\nof the exhibition\u2019s most intriguing\nand unique works. Ian Ritchie\nstarted with the theme of inventive\nlandscapes, and Norman Ackroyd\nfeatures once again with his prints\nof the Galapagos, his works acting\nas quiet, traditional foil to the other\npieces around the room. In Canvey\nIsland, the architects Nic Clear, Mike\nAling, Hyun Jun Park, and Simon\nWithers have created the model of a\ngold mine; viewers can look into the\nGallery III of the Summer Exhibition 2015 Photo: David Parry, Royal Academy of Arts\ndepths of the mine, staggered crops of\nwood and plastic that reveal glinting\npolished bronze representing the gold\nat the bottom. Above this piece hangs\nDame Zaha Hadid\u2019s vision of Beijing\nAirport.\nArchitecture is so rarely featured in\nany other gallery shows that it feels\ntruly special to have it here. Revealed\nare visions of the future, such as in\nLord Rogers of Riverside\u2019s model\nFeed the World, where power station\nchimneys have been reclaimed\nas food growing greenhouses; in\nLaurence Pinn, Ben Kirk, and Andrew\nDiggle\u2019s Urban Flora Propagation Field\nBox, the architects envisage a way to\nconserve bees in urban spaces. One\nof the most conceptual pieces and\none of the most humorous is Tale of\nthe Washer, in which Tim Robinson\nrelates the story of the missing washer\nfrom the Hubble telescope, which cost\nNASA millions to replace.\nEven though the exhibition could\nbe described as innovative, and\nexciting, it hasn\u2019t escaped the touch\nof the bizarre. One of the finest\nexamples of such is Clancy Gebler\nDavies\u2019 cilice made of her own hair.\nConceptually, it may be a meditation\non the use of hair shirts in religious\npractice as an act of penance, but\nin reality the work is very little else\nbut unsightly and ever so slightly\ndisturbing.\nThere are far too many stand out\npieces to mention them all, but\nGrayson Perry\u2019s large tapestry of\nthe couple he built his house for in\nEssex is exhibited in the small works\nroom despite being several feet in\nboth height and width. As with all\nthe other works of art in the Summer\nExhibition it is on sale \u2013 for \u00a362,000.\nThe Emin animal prints, \u00a31,250 a\npop, are guaranteed to sell out in the\nfirst few hours, and Gebler Davies\u2019\nown hair calice has already sold out,\naccording to the RA website. There\u2019s\nno accounting for taste.\nThe Summer Exhibition, which has\nran uninterrupted each year since\n1795, is one of the most unique\nexhibitions in the world. Yet in trying\nto be too many things \u2013 perhaps to\nplease too many people in catering for\nall tastes \u2013 in trying to fit in as much\nof painting, sculpture, mixed media,\nas possible, it never quite establishes\nits own identity. It houses over 1000\nworks, selected from 12,000 that\nhave been sent in, but there is no\noverarching theme to tie the galleries\ntogether and present it as a cohesive\nwhole. Craig Martin\u2019s colour scheme,\nthough refreshing and inventive is\ntoo weak to sustain all 13 rooms, each\nwith different personalities. Each\nhang is particular to the room and\nthe academician who has curated it.\nWhilst some rooms are filled sparsely,\neach piece existing in a synergy with\nthe rest of the room, in other places,\nthe room is crammed to the rafters,\na cacophony of sights and colours\nthat can be at times overwhelming.\nThere are so many pieces that it\nseems unlikely that three or even four\nvisits would be enough to cover the\nbreadth of work on display. At times\nit feels as if the exhibition consists of\nthrough multiple shows all somehow\ninterconnected in a colourful\nlabyrinth. It\u2019s entirely charming, but\nnevertheless it does leave you feeling\na little unmoored, unsure where\nwould be the best place to linger, and\nwhich spaces to move through.\nThe final room of the exhibition is\ndefinitely a place to take a breather.\nIt exhibits the life\u2019s work of Tom\nPhillips, whose alteration of the\nVictorian novel A Human Document\nbegan in the 1960s. Pages upon pages\nof The Humument line the walls of\nGallery X, each a tiny silk screened\njewel. The Humument is part painting,\npart illustration, and a considerable\npart erasure poetry. The work is\nbased on reimagining and altering\npages of a salvaged Victorian novel;\ncertain phrases have been picked out\nand the others hidden in translucent\npaint to create fragmentary poems\nthat are reminiscent of ancient\ntexts by Sappho or Catullus, where\nphrases have been lost. The absence\nof words defines the meaning as\nmuch as the words that remain.\nSpeaking about his work, Phillips\nhas said \u2018[I] plundered, mined, and\nundermined its text to make it yield\nthe ghosts of other possible stories.\u2019\nThis work alone could have sustained\nan exhibition, and one suspects\nit\u2019s less the quality of the work and\nmore Phillips\u2019 relative obscurity\nwhen compared to Perry, Emin,\nand Akroyd, that means that the\nHumument has been tacked on to the\nend of the Summer Exhibition rather\nthan honoured by a solo celebration.\nHowever, this arrangement does\nguarantee that Phillip\u2019s work will\nfind a larger audience than if he had\nstruck out on his own, and that can\nonly be a good thing.\nThe Summer Exhibition 2015 is\nan exuberant celebration of art,\nand drifting through each of the\nthirteen galleries can is something\nof a SparkNotes of the zeitgeist of\nart in Britain, filtered through the\ncapable hands of the Academy\u2019s most\ninfluential members. But don\u2019t go\nexpecting to absorb it all. The RA\nhave published for the first time this\nyear, an online catalogue of each\nof the works in the exhibition, in\naddition there are virtual tours given\nby Michael Craig Martin, Tracey\nEmin, novelist Sebastian Faulks,\nand Cath Kidston with more to be\nadded over the summer; handy if you\nwant to plan your trip or catch some\nof the work you missed. However\ncomprehensive, the online version\ncannot possibly hope to rival the real\nthing; the Summer Exhibition remains\nsomething to be enjoyed in person; a\ntrue Experience with a capital \u2018E\u2019.\nThe Summer Exhibition 2015, this\nyear co-ordinated by Michael CraigMartin CBE RA, is on at the Royal\nAcademy until 16th\nAugust.\nTickets \u00a313.50; concessions available.\nMichael Craig-Martin CBE RA unveiling a new site-specific artwork by Jim Lambie for the\nSummer Exhibition 2015 Photo: David Parry, Royal Academy of Arts\nWorks on display in Gallery II of the Summer Exhibition 2015 Photo: David Parry, Royal\nAcademy of Arts\n\"Architecture\nis so rarely\nfeatured in\nany other\ngallery shows\nthat it feels\ntruly special\nto have it\nhere\"\n\"The\nSummer\nExhibition\n2015 is an\nexuberant\ncelebration\nof the\nzeitgeist of\nBritish art\"\n\n"

Make sure you download the\ncorrect city before you leave \u2013 this is\nmade easier by the new Tripadvisor\nCatalogue app.\n6) Citymapper\nCurrently only available in certain\nmetropolis, this urban jungle\npublic transport navigation app is\nconstantly expanding territories.\nIntegrating all manner of transport,\nit helps you pick out the best travel\nroutes from point A to B, and even\ntells you the cost.\nSo if you are heading to New York,\nParis, or Madrid, this can make your\nlife a whole lot easier.\n7) Rail planner (Eurail/\nInterrail)\nAn offline app that shows you the\ntimetable for Eurail and Interrail\npasses, this is perfect for anyone\ntravelling through Europe by train.\nThis is especially true for those who\nare compulsive at planning and\nknowing every part of the journey\n(like me), because it shows you all\nthe stops and even the route on map\nso you can follow every part of the\njourney. The only downside is you\ncan\u2019t buy tickets through it.\n8) EventBrite\nAn app that I am sure most of you\nwould already possess, it lets you\ndiscover local events, buy tickets,\nand show them on your phone. This\nis perfect for last minute night out\nat a foreign city where you won\u2019t\nnecessarily have access to a printer.\n9) Airline apps\nMost airlines now have an app\nwhere you can check in and get your\nboarding pass. This is very useful,\nparticularly for those who don\u2019t have\nany luggage to check in because it\nsaves you time at the airport. It also\ngives you update on the status of the\nflight so you will know whether or not\nit\u2019s delayed.\n10) Kites\nAn app designed by an Imperial\ngraduate, this still-expanding app\nshows you recommendations by users\nall over the world. With a twitter-based format, each \u2018kite\u2019 is only 140\ncharacters long, keeping things short\nand sweet with option to add photos.\nYou can follow users and add your\nkites into a collection, like a London\nHarry Potter tour.\nHopefully these apps would help\nsmooth over your journey and makes\nlife as a traveller easier. Now your\nonly problem would be making sure\nyou have enough battery power in\nyour phone to last for the day!.\nIf you know of a good travel app\nthat isn\u2019t on the list, drop us an email\nor even tweet us to let us know!\n@felixtravel\nThe top ten apps are available in both Android and Apple device Photo: flickr/edited from Seth Merander\n\"We have\nall been\nthere...\ncalculate\nthe\nconversion\nin your\nhead .\"\n\"With\nthe apps\nmarket\nspringing\nup like\nwild\ngrass in\nspring....\"\nTips for budget airline packing\nThe sacrifice you have to make for cheap airfare is luggage restriction and ungodly hours.\nPhoto: flickr/maik_sv\nYung Nam Cheah reveal her packing secrets learn through experience\nGet ready for summer!\nSummer is just around the corner and I am sure most\nof you have something exciting line up to take the stress\nof your exams.\nWhether it\u2019s a weekend getaway in Paris,a party\nholiday at Ibiza,or even backpacking around South East\nAsia\u2013we want to hear all about it!\n\u201cBut I haven\u2019t even gone on the trip yet!\u201dsome of you\nmight cry; well,planning is as much a part of the journey\nas the journey itself.\nTweet your travel plans and travel photos @felix_travel\nand follow us to see what your travel editor 2014-2015\n(yes that\u2019s me) is up to this summer.\nFor those of you who have nothing planned yet,don\u2019t\nworry,we are here to help.With only one more issue this\nterm before summer begins for good,Travel Felix will\nbe gearing towards making sure you are ready for this\nsummer!\nThis week your past travel editor Chris Richardson is\ngoing to transport you to the charms of South America.\nI,on the other hand,will bring you tips that would\nhopefully make your summer journey easier.Whether\nit is packing your hand luggage on those budget flights\nor some handy apps that would make your travel life a\nwhole lot easier.\nAnd for those of you staying in London,we haven\u2019t\nforgotten about you\u2013there will be a special feature on\nsummer in London next week.Because no matter where\nyou go,travelling can be as close as your own backyard.\nNAM CHEAH\n\u201cHow on\nEarth\nare we\nsupposed\nto fit\neverything\nwe need\ninto such\na small\nspace?\u201d\nTravelling on budget airline isn\u2019t\neasy \u2013 you\u2019ve got the luggage\nrestriction, liquid restriction,\nand only airline magazines for\nentertainment. However, with their\nunbeatable prices you can only\ngrit your teeth and adhere to the\nincreasingly intricate rules of hand\nluggage restriction to save the extra\ndosh for something more worth it.\nThe two most popular budget\nairlines in UK are Ryanair and\nEasyjet. Surprisingly, Ryanair is the\nmore lenient of the two and offer\ntravelers a 10kg limit of a suitcase of\n55 x 40 x 20 cm size, as well as a small\nbag of 35 x 20 x 20 cm dimension.\nThough allowing a bag up to 56 x 45\nx 25 cm, Easyjet only guarantee your\nluggage with you if it\u2019s smaller than\n50 x 40 x 20cm and you can only take\none bag.\nWhilst this might not be a problem\nfor some, those of you who are a\nheavy packer \u2013 like me \u2013 will cry\nin outrage. How on Earth are we\nsupposed to fit everything we need\ninto such a small space? However,\nsince I been on two one-month long\ntrips this summer, I realised that\nyou really can pack as little as that\nand still be okay, as long as you are\nprepared.\n1) Plan your outfits two, no\nthree, times\nWhether it is for a weekend getaway\nor a year-long trip \u2013 choose your\nfavourite outfits, then choose from\nit your favourites, then again. This\nwill help you narrow down which\nreally is your favourite and save\nyou the dead weight and used space\nin your luggage. If you are not that\npicky, do it twice only. Remember\nthat unless you are heading off into\nthe wilderness (in which case you\nreally need that 20kg luggage), there\u2019s\nnothing you can\u2019t buy once you get\nthere.\n2) Get those 100ml bottles\nfrom Primark or drug stores\nThere are really no needs to succumb\ninto buying those small travel portion\nshampoo and conditioners they\nhave in Boots that costs an arm or\nleg. Be green and buy a set of travel\nbottles for 1 pound, and save yourself\nsome money. Unless you shower\nthree times a day, a 100ml bottle\nof shampoo can last you for up to a\nmonth.\nSame goes for any of your favourite\nskincare products \u2013 put them into\nthose handy little clear, circular\ncontainers. This way, you can fit a lot\ninto your 20 x 20 cm plastic bag.\nAnd need I remind you that you are\nonly allow liquids in less than 100ml\nbottle, even if the actual content in it\nis less than 100ml.\n3) Clear plastic bags \u2013 save\nsome for next trip\nSpeaking of the clear little plastic\nbags, you might be shocked to know\nthat not every airport offers them for\nfree. What? Aren\u2019t they compulsory\nto put your liquids in? Yes.\nYou can grab some (in fact, tons)\nfor free at Heathrow and Gatwick,\nbut if you are flying from Stansted\nor Luton, bring you own, otherwise\nyou will have to pay 1 pounds for five\neven if you only need one.\nIf you are a frequent traveler, just\ngrab a few and re-use them \u2013 saves\nyou time as well.\n4) Wear all the chunky stuff\nThis is especially true for shoes. If you\nare bringing a pair of walking boots,\nor any chunky footwear, it\u2019s best to\nconserve space by wearing them.\nBundle as many layers on your body\nas you can; it might look weird but\nyou are saving precious space! Take a\ncoat with you too, to keep that space\nfree in your bag for other things.\n5) Send in one bag as a group\nIf there are enough of you going\ntogether, and you all have something\nyou desperately want to bring some\nmore goodies on the plane, then it\nmight be feasible to send one bag\nthrough together. This will make it\nmore economical and if you are all\nin it together then no one can point\nfingers when you wait for luggage!\nSummer at London isn\u2019t even remotely close to boring.

Far be it from me to disagree\nwith him, but the man greatly\nmisestimated his talents. Beckett\u2019s\nwriting does not really exist in the\nrealm of the written word; instead,\nwhat he was exceptionally talented\nat was creating an atmosphere. His\nworks may be endlessly interpreted\nby generation upon generation of\nscholars, eager to eake out more and\nmore meaning from every syllable,\nbut it is upon the stage that his words\nreally come to life, forcing us to sit up,\npay attention, and be awed.\nPerhaps nowhere is this more\napparent than in Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9\u2019s\ninterpretation of Lessness, a short\nstory translated from the original\nFrench work, Sans. The work, which\nis a pair of seemingly random\narrangements of 60 sentences, when\nseen on paper, is really nothing more\nthan a jumble of repeating words\nand phrases. But when transported\ninto the Barbican\u2019s Frobisher\nAuditorium, a deeply intimate\nvenue, Fou\u00e9r\u00e9\u2019s reading allows us to\nmake sense of the piece.\nSitting at a desk, bare but for a\nanglepoise-style lamp, Fou\u00e9r\u00e9 faces\nthe audience, her white hair pushed\nback behind a utilitarian pair of\nheadphones. Above her, a wide\nscreen of static is projected against\nthe wall, flickering to and fro. The\npiece begins, and over the next 35\nminutes she lures us into a trance\nthrough the sheer power of Beckett\u2019s\nmind. With certain phrases coming\nto prominence - little body; only\nupright; true refuge - the mechanical\ndelivery of the lines weaves an\nimaginary tapestry in the minds of\nthe viewer. Fleeting and ephemeral,\nthis vision, one of desolation,\nlonging, and alienation, somehow\nmanages to be both concrete and\nungraspable, something accentuated\nby the minimal drone soundtrack,\ncomposed by Phill Niblock. The\noverall effect is heady and powerful,\ncreating a headspace for the audience,\nwhich I can only describe with the\nword \u2018trippy\u2019 - a term that simply does\nnot do justice to what was going on in\nthe room.\nIt is not clear whether Fou\u00e9r\u00e9 is\nreciting from memory, or if she\nis being fed the lines one-by-one\nthrough her headphones. It\u2019s not\neven clear whether this is the original\nwork, or one of the innumerable\narrangements of the sentences\nthat are possible. Fou\u00e9r\u00e9, for her\nSydney Theatre Company, Waiting for Godot, Richard Roxburgh, Luke Mullins, Hugo Weaving and Philip Quast Photo: Lisa Tomasetti\npart, refuses to give the game away,\ndelivering her lines in a flat style that\nbrings to mind the American artist\nLaurie Anderson. Born in Ireland to\nFrench parents, Fou\u00e9r\u00e9\u2019s upbringing\nmakes her perhaps the perfect\nperson to interpret Beckett\u2019s work,\nunderstanding the nuances of both\nthe French and Irish components\nof his mind; she certainly doesn\u2019t\ndisappoint, conjuring up a ruined\nmental landscape that seems to go on\nforever.\nWhile Fou\u00e9r\u00e9 manages to generate\na desolate wilderness in the mind\nof the audience, such an effort is\nnot needed for those going to see\nthe Sydney Theatre Company\u2019s\nproduction of Waiting for Godot, for\nwhich the Barbican Theatre has been\nturned into an actual wasteland. The\nstage, bare but for a naked tree which\ntwists upward to the rafters, cutting\na sharp line through the space, forms\nthe setting in which the characters\nmerely wait. And wait. And wait. Not\nfor nothing did critic Vivian Mercier\ndescribe it as \u2018a play in which nothing\nhappens, twice\u2019. And yet, somehow it\nseems that everything happens. I will\nnot try to elaborate on the meaning\nof the play; there is no point, and\nBeckett plays more on the nerves and\nheartstrings of the audience, instead\nof functioning as a cerebral exercise.\nAll I need to say is that by the time\nthe play is over, we are just that much\ncloser to understanding the human\ncondition.\nThe small cast, comprising of four\nmain members, is incredibly tight:\nRichard Roxburgh lends a subtle\nAustralian brogue to his put-upon\nEstragon, and finds a formidable\nsparring partner in his companion\nVladimir, played by Hugo Weaving.\nThe pair bicker and squabble,\nenacting out various games, passing\nthe time as they wait for the unseen\ntitular character. How long they have\nbeen waiting, how long they will\ncontinue to wait, remains a mystery,\nfurthering the sense of alienation\nthe audience finds themselves on the\nreceiving end of. Philip Quast plays\nthe role of Pozzo, who seems to be\ntrapped in his relationship with the\nput-upon Lucky. Dragged this way\nand that, near-mute throughout the\nmajority of the play, until he vomits\nforth a stream of consciousness at the\nend of Act I, Lucky is perhaps one of\nthe most difficult characters to get\nright, but Luke Mullins brings an\nextraordinary physicality to the role.\nWhile the setting pays homage\nto the idea of a post-apocalyptic\nwasteland, set designer Zsolt Khell\nalso toys with the idea of the nature\nof theatre - with its exposed backdrop,\nthe stage is clearly just that: a stage.\nPerhaps Khell is trying to emphasise\nthe idea that the theatre is a dead\nart; or maybe, as Pozzo says, \u2018they\ngive birth astride a grave\u2019, and the\ninstantaneous gleam of light that is\nlife is akin to a performance; either\nway the staging has a powerful\neffect on the play\u2019s meaning and\natmosphere. In her costume design,\nAlice Babbage - and perhaps I am\nreading too much into this - seems\nto have taken a uniquely Australian\ndirection: the down-on-their-luck\ncharacters lurch around the stage\nin old boots and musty jackets in\na spectrum of grey, looking like\nsome early settlers, lost in the bleak\noutback.\nThe English translation of Waiting\nfor Godot is given the subtitle \u2018a\ntragicomedy in two acts\u2019, and in this\nproduction the comedic elements\nare certainly highlighted. Capering\naround the stage, Roxburgh and\nWeaving form a brilliant duo, with\nVladimir providing a witty foil to\nEstragon\u2019s more grounded grumbles.\nThe production is clearly indebted to\nthe theatrical tradition of slapstick,\nand the early physicality of actors\nsuch as Buster Keaton, which provides\na rich seam of imaginative influences\nfor director Andrew Upton to mine.\nAt some points, however, it feels that\nthis aspect has taken precedence over\nthe tragic elements of the script, with\nthe themes of isolation, loneliness,\nand general bleakness taking a back\nseat. This does provide a warmth to\nthe play, which I have not seen in\nother versions, but - particularly on a\nwarm summer night - sometimes one\nrequires a little bit of chill.\nOwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9\u2019s Lessness was on at the\nBarbican\u2019s Frobisher Auditorium from\n5th\n- 8th\nJune\nThe Sydney Theatre Company\u2019s\nWaiting for Godot is on at the Barbican\nTheatre until 13th\nJune.

Photo: Creative Commons\nCHOO CHOO! Max Eggl welcomes you to the Star Wars hype train!\nWar. War never changes... (Part 4)\nIf you love star wars, first person\nshooters or in fact games in\ngeneral, you could not have missed\nthe fact that the makers of Battlefield,\nDICE are remaking one of the best\nFirst Person Shooters (FPS) game ever.\nWhen the original battlefront\nand its sequel came out and in my\nchildhood I spent many, many,\nmany hours immersed in these titles.\nTherefore when it was first announced\nthat there would be finally be a new\ngame, tied in with the new movie\n(which I am also more than excited to\nsee), I didn\u2019t just board hype train, but\nbought the whole damn track! Ever\nsince then we have been drip fed news\nregarding the games development and\npossible features, and I was getting\nmore and more excited.\nHowever, just last month EA finally\ndecided to come clean about some\nof the features (or lack thereof when\ncompared with the previous games)\nthat would be included in the game,\nas well as showing off a teaser trailer.\nThe trailer itself looked amazingly\ngood (and brought about as many\nfeels as the movie trailer did), we saw\nspeeder bikes, AT-ATs, force fields\nand jetpacks among many other\nthings. The concepts on show looked\npretty amazing, and I really hope that\nthe game-play delivers what the trailer\npromised. While the graphics looked\nstunning, you have to keep in mind\nthat this was actually all pre-rendered,\nprobably over a couple of days, to\nmake it look so good. So we can\nassume that it won\u2019t really look that\namazingly good, even with the best of\nPCs. Sadly, most of us don\u2019t have the\nbest PCs around, so you may have to\ndeal with the less beautiful graphics or\nupgrade to a new rig (I really want to\ndo the latter, but will probably have to\naccept the former).\nIn terms of features we have\nconfirmed that there will be 12\nplayable maps at launch on the\nplanets Hoth, Endor, Tattoine and\nSullust. Furthermore, in lieu of actual\nspace battles (yes they won\u2019t be in\nthe game) we will instead have space\nships in the ground battles, a l\u00e1 Hoth\nfrom Battlefront 2. Furthermore, it\nhas been confirmed that heroes will\nmake a comeback, however at this\npoint only Darth Vader and Boba\nFett are confirmed. However, very\nsadly, there will won\u2019t a single-player\ncampaign. Especially the lack of a\nsingle-player campaign makes me a\nbit sad. While I do get the move to\nmultiplayer only, the singleplayer\nin Battlefront 2 really had something\nspecial and told a really good story!\nWith regards to the space battles, I\nam not really too fussed. They were\nkinda cool, but in reality where\nreally repetitive and while they may\nhave worked better in this modern\niteration, I don\u2019t think we have lost\nthat much.\nOne warning that I would give you\nguys, is don\u2019t preorder. There are no\nassociated bonuses, and given DICE\u2019s\nYes, the day of reckoning is\nupon us. Global productivity\nhas come to a standstill. These\nare the news headline that will echo\naround the world on the day of the\nrelease of Fallout 4.\nIf you have spent any time on the\ninternet in the past week, you know\nthat Bethesda has made a good\nattempt at breaking it! After putting\nup a countdown about a week ago,\nBethesda then released the trailer to\nthe newest installment in the Fallout\nseries.\nFor all of you who don\u2019t know\nwhat Fallout is; Fallout is a RPG\ngame set in a post apocalyptic which\nhas been ravaged by a nuclear war.\nThese games revolve around you\nthe protagonist trying to survive\nthis harsh wasteland. The games\nthemselves originated from a\ntext-based game to a full sandbox\ngame with RPG and FPS elements.\nBasically, imagine Skyrim with\ntechnology in post-apocalyptic\nAmerica, but better.\nSadly, the last Fallout game\nwas Fallout: New Vegas, which was\nannounced in 2010, almost 5 years\nago. So now, out of the blue (ok\nfine, there have been several hints\nhere and there, but nothing really\nsolid) to get this is pretty neat. The\ntrailer itself has that same Fallout\nfeel as previous installments, with\nthe 40s, 50s style music and retro\nfuturistic design. We follow a dog,\nas he explores an abandoned house,\ngetting the occasional flashback\nto the better, more hopeful time\nbefore the nuclear war. We then are\ntreated to a view of a ravaged and\ndestroyed Boston where the game\nwill take place, followed by scenes\nof feral ghouls and even a return\nof Deathclaw, a villain from the\nprevious games. Furthermore, we\nare given the number of the vault\nthat it seems our main character\ncomes from, namely 111 (which also\nhappens to be binary for seven which\nis pretty cool since this is the seventh\ngame in the series!).\nThere is no real further\ninformation from the game, but if\nyou can\u2019t hold in your excitement\nthere are several analysis videos of\nthe trailer that are trying to glean\nas much information from it as\npossible. Most people are hoping\nfor more information, including a\nrelease date, at E3 which is in about\na week. However, what we do know\nis that the game will be available on\nXbox One, PS4 and PC, so if you still\nown the old generation of consoles it\nmay be time to update!\nI have to say that I am really,\nreally excited for this game. There\nhasn\u2019t been any really good post-apocalyptic games like Fallout in\na while (DayZ and all the zombie\ngames didn\u2019t really live up to their\nhype), so I really can\u2019t wait to unpack\nmy vault boy, gorge on some nuke\ncola and explore the destroyed land\nthat is post-nuclear america.\nMAX EGGL\nSECTION EDITOR\nImagine\nSkyrim\nwith\ntechnology\nin post-apocalyptic\nAmerica,\nbut better.\nThere\nhasn\u2019t been\nany really\ngood post-apocalyptic\ngames like\nFallout in a\nwhile.\n\"I didn\u2019t\njust board\nhype train,\nbut bought\nthe whole\ndamn\ntrack! \"\ntrack record with releases, I would\nfind no benefit in spending my hard-earned cash so early. Server issues will\ndefinitely be a problem, and I think\nthat the day-one patch will probably\nbe a necessity. After all the initial\nhype has settled down and all the\ninitial bugs are patched, you should\nbe able to decide quite clearly if you\ncan afford this game and/or your\ncomputer can handle it!\n\"One\nwarning\nthat I\nwould give\nyou guys,\nis don\u2019t\npreorder.\"\nThis is the best marketing a game has ever had and in fact ever will have.\nPhoto: Creative Commons\n\n"

It is often\ndone using razors, sharpened rocks,\nglass or even fingernails as tools.\nThe partial or total removal of the\nexternal female genitalia or other\ninjury to the female genital organs\nfor non-medical reasons has been\nreferred to as mutilation since 1929.\nDespite this, FGM is still often called\nfemale circumcision, or by a huge\nvariety of terms that imply cleansing\nor purification. By others, it is\nreferred to as \u201ccutting\u201d.\nFGM is a violation of human\nrights under several conventions, but\ndespite this it is widely performed\nin some parts of the world, largely\nconcentrated in 29 countries across\nAfrica, with varying levels of\nprevalence. It is most common in\nSomalia, Guinea, Djibouti, Egypt and\nSierra Leone, where more than 90%\nof women experience FGM. However\nthis is not to say that it is only a\nproblem in Africa. It is estimated\nthat more than 137 thousand women\nin girls in the UK have been forced\nto undergo FGM, an estimate that is\nincreasing month on month.\nFGM is traditionally done to\npreserve virginity, reduce sexual\ndesire, and even maintain a clean\nappearance of the genital organs.\nThere are several types, ranging from\npricking or cauterising the clitoris,\nto total removal of the clitoral hood,\nglans, inner and outer labia, with\nthe total closure of the genital area,\nwith a small hole left for urine and\nmenstrual blood to pass through. The\nWorld Health Organisation classifies\nFGM into four categories, where each\ntype varies in prevalence. The most\nextreme type of FGM \u00ad\u2013 where the\nlegs are bound together from thigh\nto ankle for weeks following the\nprocedure to allow healing \u2013 is carried\nout on 90% of all girls in Somalia.\nGirls who are not cut are often\noutcast by their community, being\ncalled unclean or impure. There is\n\"more than\n20,000 girls\nunder the\nage of 15 in\nthe UK are\nconsidered\nat risk\"\n\"It is often\ndone using\nrazors,\nsharpened\nrocks, glass\nor even\nfingernails\"\nimmense pressure on families to\nmutilate their children, particularly\nfrom elder female members of\nthe family. It is often these senior\nmatriarchs who will enforce\nthis torture; in a parallel to male\ncircumcision, it is largely done\nbecause it was done to them \u2013 there\nare no reported health benefits.\nHowever despite this being so\nwidespread in some countries, it\nis unspoken, often referred to as\n\u201cwashing your hands\u201d or \u201chaving\nyour bath\u201d, and most women in\nthese regions lack the vocabulary to\ndescribe what has happened to them\nor talk about it properly. In most\ncommunities, the women do not\nrealise that ensuing problems are as\na result of the procedure and most\nwomen who have undergone FGM\nsay that they would do it to their\ndaughters, but this is largely because\nthey have never known anything\nelse, and they do not realise the\nimplications. Increasingly, women\nwho have emigrated to Western\ncountries are horrified at what has\nbeen done to them, but continue the\npractise out of fear of being shunned.\nCutting is often not seen as a rite\nof passage, something to signal the\ntransformation from girl to women.\nFGM has very complex and varied\nroots; it is recorded as practices\nrelating both to religion or ethnic\ntraditions, depending on the region.\nThere are versions of FGM, such as\nthe stretching and lengthening of the\nlabia minora or clitoris, or internal\ncutting of the vaginal walls, which\nare said to enhance the pleasure\nexperienced by men. The roots of the\npractice, particularly in the case of\nsewing, seem to stem from preventing\nyoung girls and women from\nengaging in any sexual activity before\nthey are married \u2013 it is common for\na man\u2019s family to inspect the woman\nto ensure that her barrier is intact.\nOnce a girl is married, she will be cut\npartially open either by her husband,\nmother-in-law, or a circumciser (who\nis usually an elderly woman) to allow\nfor penetration. In the later case of\nchildbirth, she will be cut open to\nallow her to give birth, and closed\nafterwards.\nComplications can arise as a result\nof this repeated cutting, as well as\nfrom the procedure itself. There are\nmany common complications such\nas bleeding, swelling, infection, and\nproblems with healing. Scarring\nand keloids may form, and damage\nto the urethra and vagina may\ncause infections, incontinence, and\neven infertility. Women who have\nexperienced FGM are at higher risk\nof problems during pregnancy, and\nhave a higher chance of neonatal\nmortality. They are more likely to\nexperience pain during sex, have\nno sexual desire, or reduced sexual\nfeelings.\nFGM has long been outlawed in\nmany Western countries, including\nthe UK since 1985, and this month,\nNigeria, where around 25% of females\nare cut, passed a law banning this\npractice. Nigeria is not the first\nAfrican country to do so, but it\nrepresents a significant step forward\nfor a country where it is ingrained\nin cultural fabric of so many\ncommunities. Of course, there is a lot\nof progress yet to be made in Nigeria\nalone; simply criminalising FGM will\nnot immediately stop all incidence\nof this violence, but it represents a\nchange to the traditional culture of\nviolence against women, and will\nhopefully cause a shift in thinking\nthat will spread across the rest of\nAfrica.\nThis is a lot to take in, and a lot of\nIn some parts of the world, FGM is the norm, but while it is seen as so horrific in the UK, it is rarely mentioned. Photo: flipboard.com\n\"it has\nalways been\nswept under\nthe rug,\nwith people\nafraid to\ndiscuss it\nit for fear\nof being\nculturally\ninsensitive.\"\n\"While it\nwas already\noutlawed in\nsome states,\nin others it\nis a cultural\nnormality.\"\nit might make you reel in horror. But\nthe fact is, in the UK, FGM is also a\nsignificant issue. Even though it has\nbeen criminalised for decades, it has\nalways been swept under the rug, with\npeople afraid to discuss it for fear of\nbeing culturally insensitive. It was\nonly last year that data began to be\ncollected on the prevalence of FGM\nin the UK, and by all counts, it seems\nto have been grossly underestimated.\nIn March, 578 women and girls\nwere treated for FGM in England,\nwith thousands being reported since\nSeptember. Every month that data is\ncollected, the estimate for the number\nof women suffering the effects of this\nmutilation increases.\nFGM hit the headlines in the UK\nlast year when it was revealed that\nthere had never been a successful\nprosecution for the practice of FGM,\neven though it has been illegal in\nthe UK for a long time, with laws\nstrengthened in 2003 preventing\ntravel to other countries for the\npurpose of performing FGM. Last\nyear, guidelines for Border Force\nagents were changed, to help prevent\ngirls from being taken out of the\ncountry to be cut, and teachers and\ndoctors have begun to be trained\nin identifying girls that may be at\nrisk. In February this year, the first\never FGM case in the UK went to\ncourt, but it was against a doctor\nin an isolated case, not prosecuting\nsomeone working as a cutter in a\nlarge clinic, one of the circumcisers\nwho come to the UK for \u201ccutting\nparties\u201d, or someone taking their\nchild to be mutilated abroad; these\nincidents have yet to be adequately\ninvestigated.\nFor Nigeria, it is a huge step to ban\nFGM across the country. While it was\nalready outlawed in some states, in\nothers it is a cultural normality. With\nthis law, the Nigerian government\nare saying that a traditional\ncultural practice is suddenly totally\nunacceptable, regardless of its\nhistorical significance. This is not\nan easy thing to do; certainly many\npeople will be unhappy with this, as\nthey have always done it and believe\ncutting to be necessary, but now that\nit has been criminalised the awareness\nand education will increase and the\nprevalence will decrease. If Nigeria\ncan make such a bold statement, I\nthink that we also should be able to\nmake as much effort, be it through\na strengthening of prevention,\neducation, and awareness.\nI find the number of women and\ngirls, both within and outside this\ncountry, who are forced to undergo\nmutilation to be shocking. I find\nit horrifying that even within this\ncountry girls are being taken away\nto be cut, not because it has any\nbenefits, but because of a longstanding culture of shame. The only\nway to stem this appalling practice is\nto the break the taboo that shrouds\nit; by taking away the euphemisms\nand misunderstandings, and giving\nwomen the option not to do this to\ntheir daughters.\n1 \u2013 9%\n10 \u2013 29%\n30 \u2013 49%\n50 \u2013 69%\n70 \u2013 89%\n90 \u2013 99%\nPrevalence of FGM\nBenin\n7\nBurkina Faso\n76\nCAR\n24\nCameroon\n1\nChad\n44\nC\u00f4te\nd'Ivoire\n38\nDjibouti\n93\nEgypt\n91\nEritrea\n83\nEthiopia\n74\nGambia\n76\nGhana\n4\nGuinea\nGuinea-Bissau\n50\nIraq\n8\nKenya\n27\nLiberia\n66\nMali\n89\nMauritania\n69 Niger\n2\nNigeria\n25\nSenegal\n26\nSierra Leone\n90\nSomalia\nSudan\n88\nTanzania\n15\nTogo\n4\nUganda\nYemen\n97\n98\n1\n19\n\n"

In this first room we\u2019re\nintroduced to the quintessential\nAgnes Martin: large canvases of\ncalming pastel washes methodically\ncontained by faintly drawn ruled\nlines. She always considered herself\nan Abstract Expressionist, which\nmay come as a surprise given the\nobvious contrasts with the Pollocks,\nde Koonings and Rothkos that\nthe term conjures up. But just as\nthose artists relied on automatism\nas a technique, surrendering\ntheir actions to impulses of the\nunconscious, Martin\u2019s grids sprang\nfrom her mind\u2019s eye. And although\nshe planned the dimensions of her\ncanvas works with meticulous care,\nvideos showing her at work depict\nan artist who is quick and decisive\nin her application of paint. Almost\nimpulsive in her movements, she is a\nvery gestural painter, just as her male\ncontemporaries were.\nMartin was interested in painting\nsomething entirely removed from\nthe physical world. In interviews she\nreferred to an attempt to capture\ninternal states \u2013 we\u2019re invited to\nconnect to something vestigial,\nthe beauty that remains in the\nmind when the image of the rose\nis taken away. She said of her work\nthat it was about \u201clight, lightness,\nabout merging, about formlessness\nbreaking down form\u201d. Later in her\nlife, she playfully claimed that she\nhad given up intellectualising thanks\nto a painful parting with Einstein\u2019s\nTheory of Relativity, and she always\nresisted formal analysis of her\nwork. It seems ironic then that the\nmajority of us will cry out for just\nsuch an intellectualising in order to\nstart understanding these very bare\ncanvases. We reach for meaning\nand guidance, for the theoretical\nbackdrop; when really Agnes Martin\nwants us to clear our minds and\nsimply to meditate on the paintings.\nOnly then can we begin to realize our\n\u201cfull response to this work\u201d.\nBut who was Agnes Martin? Born\nin Canada in 1912, she had a strict\nreligious upbringing at the hands\nof her maternal grandparents. This\nchildhood went on to shape her\nprofessional struggle with the sin of\n\u2018pride\u2019; throughout her career she was\nat pains to resolve a fierce ambition\nwith a reluctance to embrace the idea\nof success. Leaving Canada for the US\nto study, she went on to qualify as a\nteacher and finally decided to become\nan artist at the age of 30. Moving out\nto complete further study and live in\nNew Mexico, she was only persuaded\nto return to the art world of New York\nwhen the famous art dealer Betty\nParsons offered to represent her. New\nYork of the 50s and 60s was a hub of\nmasculine energy, both in the stark\nand formal style of the Minimalists\nand the brash, sexual Abstract\nExpressionism.\nBut Agnes Martin aligned herself\nto an undercurrent. Her neighbours\nand friends at the time were the\nsubversive young community that\ntook up residence in the disused\nwarehouses of Coenties Slip. Here,\namongst the dilapidated workshops\nand shipping rubble, artists of a\nnew generation were finding their\nvoice. Although they didn\u2019t form\na coherent movement and their\npractices remained diverse, they\nsupported each other throughout\na period that brought the liberty\nof experimentation, allowing each\nof them to discover their very\nsingular styles. Many of the artists\nmaking up this group went on to\ngain recognition within the larger\nart establishment, with names\nsuch as Lenore Tawney, Ellsworth\nKelly, Robert Indiana, and Jack\nYoungerman claiming their rightful\nplace in American art history.\nEarly on in the exhibition, the Tate\nshowcases Martin\u2019s works from\nthis period, and through doing so\nprovides some insight into the origins\nof the grid paintings for which she\nis most famous. The intriguing and\nultimately surprising display reveals\nsculptural pieces constructed from\nthe materials that Martin found in\nthe scrapyards bordering her studio\nat Coenties Slip. You sense that\nworking in 3D gave her a certain\nrelease from the painted form; it\nwas these works that allowed her\nthe space to better appreciate the\nphysicality of shape and structure.\nIt\u2019s difficult not to think of these\nmixed media assemblages as natural\nprecursors to the development of the\ngrid, particularly Water 1958, with its\ntaught linear strings of painted wire.\nIn fact, the smaller painted works\nshe was producing at the time were\nalready exploring manifestations of\nrepetitive lattices of lines.\nThen follows the room where we\nencounter some of the earliest grid\npaintings produced by Martin. The\nyear is 1963, and there are only three\ncanvases on the walls, which the\ncurators have selected to represent the\nvital transition in Martin\u2019s oeuvre.\nThey are striking in their differences.\nSuddenly we start to understand\nthe potential contained within such\ndeceptively simple arrangements of\nvertical and horizontal lines. Always\nworking on the same scale of 72 x 72\ninches, throughout the 60s Martin\nwas uncompromising in her subtle\nyet assured portrayals of seemingly\nbanal subjects such as Tree, Rose, and\nMorning. The faint pencil lines are\nboth precise and slightly uneven,\ncarrying a richness that reveals itself\nonly after careful inspection. In the\nwords of the critic Lucy Lippard,\nMartin\u2019s works are remarkable\nexamples of \u201cunrepetitive use of a\nrepetitive medium\u201d. Such imaginative\nuse of grids brought the artist much\nattention, and increasingly she was\nincluded in group shows, something\nshe resisted and struggled against. In\nfact, it eventually pushed her to give\nup painting altogether: in 1967 she\npacked up her things and abandoned\nNew York to travel around the\ncountry for 18 months, before settling\non a remote mesa in New Mexico.\nHere she built a house out of logs and\nadobe bricks, and led a largely self\nsufficient, ascetic lifestyle completely\ndetached from the art world. She was\nonly prompted to take up her practice\nagain 5 years later when a German\ngallery commissioned her to produce\na series of screenprints.\nThe show is curated with great\ncare by the Tate\u2019s Director of\nInternational Art, Francis Morris,\nwho has been working towards this\nexhibition for many years. We\nshould be grateful, since as visitors\nwe benefit from being guided by the\nhand and introduced to the artist in\ntwo halves. Split between the North\nand South galleries we first witness\nan artist finding her form during the\nNew York period and then, following\nher return to painting from 1974,\nclaiming that form with an assured\nconfidence. An interconnecting\npassageway displaying the 30 German\nscreenprints guides us between\nthese two periods. In the North\ngalleries, the later works are bathed\nin natural light from the windows\nfacing the Thames, as if echoing the\nopenness and wild prosperity of the\nNew Mexican landscape in which\nthey were produced. Many of these\npaintings from the 1970s make\nup whole series, an approach that\nallowed Martin to explore certain\nthemes in greater depth.\nThe turbulence of her final painting\nUntitled 2004, on display in the show,\nis strangely at odds with others from\nthe period. The greys of the coloured\nsections seem almost haphazardly\napplied when compared to her\nsignature smooth washes. Yet, this\nwork is her self-selected epitaph.\nA few days before her death, she\nrequested that her gallerist and longtime friend Arne Glimcher returned\nto her studio and cut two of the\ncanvases of the three paintings she\nhad left there. An uncompromising\nself-editor, she had always cut the\nmajority of her output over the course\nof her career, leaving only the works\nshe was entirely satisfied with. The\nselection policy seems baffling. It is\nclaimed that she aimed for exactitude\nand perfection in her execution, yet\nsome of the paintings in the show\nreveal imprecision in the grids and\nthe occasionally \u2018messy\u2019 reality of\nusing very liquid washes. Actually, it\nis these revelations that hint at the\nintrinsic humanity behind the higher\nconcepts she was trying to capture\nand end up feeling like the most\nemotionally resonant aspect of the\nwork. In an interview, Glimcher has\ndrawn comparisons between the final\npainting and one she had produced\nduring the 1970s, Trumpet. Both are\n\u2018stormy\u2019 and unsettling, in spite of\nthe use of Martin\u2019s signature pastel\npalette. And so we\u2019re left with an\nenigmatic final statement, a reference\nto an earlier piece, from a painter who\nalways insisted on letting her work\nspeak for itself.\nAgnes Martin is on at the Tate Modern\nuntil 11th\nOctober.\nTickets \u00a312; concessions available.\nUntitled #1 2003 ; Fondation Louis Vuitton, Paris Photo: 2015 Agnes\nMartin / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York\nOn a Clear Day 1973; Parasol Press, Ltd.Photo: 2015 Agnes Martin /\nArtists Rights Society (ARS), New York\nFriendship 1963; Museum of Modern Art, New York Photo: 2015 Agnes Martin / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York\n\u201cAlmost\nimpulsive\ninher\nmovements,\nMartinisa\nverygestural\npainter,like\nherpeers\u201d\n\u201cMartin\nwants us\nto clear\nour minds,\nand simply\nmeditate\non the\npaintings\u201d\n\u201cHer 3D\nwork\ngave her\na certain\nrelease\nfrom the\npainted\nform\u201d\n\"There is\nan intrinsic\nhumanity\nbehinf\nthe higher\nconcepts\nthat she\ncaptured\"\n\n"

His comments were\npublished on Twitter by Connie St\nLouis, a Director of studies in Science\nJournalism at City University,\nLondon, who was attending the\nevent. Ms St Louis said that the event\nwas \u201cutterly ruined\u201d by the sexist\ncomments.\n\u201cNobody was laughing, everybody\nwas stony-faced,\u201d she said in an\ninterview with the BBC. \u201cThe Korean\nfemale scientists who hosted us\nlooked aghast and he just ploughed\non for about five to seven minutes. It\nwas culturally insensitive and it was\nvery sexist.\n\u201cI just thought, \u2018Where in the world\ndo you think you are that you can\nbe making these kind of comments\nin 2015?\u2019\u201d. Ms St Louis was among\naround 100 guests in attendance at\nthe lunch in South Korea on Monday\n8th\nJune.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today\nprogramme, Sir Hunt said he is\n\u201creally sorry that I caused any\noffence\u201d and that it was \u201ca very stupid\nthing to do in the presence of all those\njournalists\u201d, but admitted that he \u201cdid\nmean\u201d what he had said.\n\u201cI just meant to be honest, actually\u201d.\nWith regard to his remark about\nwomen crying, he stated \u201cIt\u2019s terribly\nimportant that you can criticise\npeople\u2019s ideas without criticising\nthem and if they burst into tears, it\nmeans that you tend to hold back\nfrom getting at the absolute truth\u201d.\nHe also said \u201cI have fallen in love\nwith people in the lab and people in\nthe lab have fallen in love with me\nand it\u2019s very disruptive to the science\nbecause it\u2019s terribly important that\nin a lab people are on a level playing\nfield\u201d.\nSir Hunt stressed that his earlier\ncomments were intended to be \u201clighthearted\u201d and \u201cironic\u201d but had been\n\u201cinterpreted deadly seriously by my\naudience\u201d. He has subsequently been\ncriticised by several leading members\nof the scientific community.\nFormer chief scientific adviser\nto the president of the European\nCommission Professor Anne Glover\nsaid in a statement \u201cTim Hunt\nseems to have been speaking about\nhis personal problems in relating to\nwomen.\n\u201cWhat he describes is not my\nexperience and I have never had a\nstudent (male or female, straight\nor gay) cry when their research was\ncriticised. Maybe it has something\nto do with the way you criticise. I\nhope his attitudes regarding women\nare largely confined to a former\ngeneration\u201d.\nChief executive of the British\nScience Association Imran Khan\ncalled Sir Hunt\u2019s comments\n\u201ccareless\u201d and stated: \u201cSadly, dealing\nwith sexism and other forms of\ndiscrimination are a daily reality\nfor many people, and I imagine it\u2019s\nhard to find Sir Tim\u2019s comments\nfunny if you\u2019ve been held back by\nsystemic bias for years \u2013 whether\nthose remarks were intended as a joke\nor not\u201d.\nSir Hunt won the 2001 Nobel Prize\nfor Physiology or Medicine for his\nwork on cell division and became a\nfellow of the Royal Society in 1991.\nThe Royal Society were quick to\ndistance themselves, releasing a\nstatement that said \u201cSir Tim Hunt\nwas speaking as an individual and his\nreported comments in no way reflect\nthe views of the Royal Society\u201d.\n\u201cThe Royal Society believes that\nin order to achieve everything that\nit can, science needs to make the\nbest use of the research capabilities\nof the entire population. Too many\ntalented individuals do not fulfil\ntheir scientific potential because of\nissues such as gender and the Society\nis committed to helping to put this\nright\u201d.\nSeveral critics called for the\norganisation to take action against Sir\nHunt after reports of the comments\ninitially surfaced, including fellow\nfellow of the Royal Society Professor\nDorothy Bishop, a professor of\ndevelopmental neuropsychology at\nthe University of Oxford.\n\u201cI have no doubt that, nice guy as\neveryone confirms he is, he does his\nbest not to be overtly prejudiced, but\nhe clearly has a view of women that\njust makes him inappropriate in these\nroles,\u201d she stated.\nProfessor Bishop urged the Royal\nSociety to remove Sir Hunt from\ncommittees that influence and\nmake decisions on appointments,\nfellowships and policy. \u201cIf this were\ndone, and a public statement issued to\nthat effect by the Royal Society, this\nwould demonstrate their seriousness\nabout diversity\u201d.\nIt was announced on Thursday 11th\nJune that Sir Hunt had contacted\nthe Royal Society offering to resign\nfrom its Biological Sciences Awards\nCommittee; his resignation has\nbeen accepted. The Royal Society\nsaid that Sir Hunt now recognises\nthat his earlier comments were\n\u201cunacceptable\u201d.\nIn a statement on their website, the\nRoyal Society said \u201cSir Tim Hunt\u2019s\nrecent comments relating to women\nin science have no place in science,\u201d\nbut also noted that \u201cSir Tim Hunt\nhas made exceptional contributions\nto science\u201d and \u201cover the years he has\nalso supported the careers of many\nyoung researchers.\n\u201cIt is the great respect that he has\nearned for his work that has made his\nrecent comments so disappointing\u201d.\nThe Royal Society affirmed their\ncommitment to \u201chelping to put this\nright\u201d.\nOn Wednesday 10th\nJune University\nCollege London confirmed that Sir\nHunt has resigned from his position\nas Honorary Professor with the UCL\nFaculty of Life Sciences. \u201cUCL was the\nfirst university in England to admit\nwomen students on equal terms to\nmen, and the university believes that\nthis outcome is compatible with our\ncommitment to gender equality\u201d.\nSir Tim Hunt apparently now recognises that his comments were unacceptable.

Enter Chile\u2019s Colchagua\nValley. My initial plan was to call it\na day at the Mendoza Malbecs but,\nfollowing several tastings in the area,\nmy thirst was far from quenched: the\ntime was clearly ripe to search for\nsomething new.\nColchagua extends across Chile\u2019s\ncentral valley, a beautiful strip of epic\nproportions dedicated to traditional\nagriculture and winemaking. It is\nknown for its full-bodied Cabernet\nSauvignons, Syrahs, and Malbecs,\nnot to mention Carmenere, which\nwas rediscovered in 1994 and is now\nmostly produced in Chile. That said,\nthere\u2019s a plethora of other excellent\nred and white varietals found\nthroughout the region. Despite being\nmuch closer to the equator than\nEurope\u2019s vineyards, the region has\na solid Mediterranean climate, with\nthe nearby Pacific Ocean bringing\na consistent cooling effect to the\nvalley. And, perhaps above all, the\nAndes help to maintain grape acidity\nlevels through diurnal temperature\nvariation, and deliver fresh melted\nwater into the valley in the form of\nthe Tinguiririca River.\nBut it\u2019s obviously not just the\nsolid science that gives Colchagua\nits appeal: aesthetically, the valley\nis nothing short of stunning. The\ngorgeous landscape is accented with\nendless picturesque vineyards, and\nthe perfect summer days drastically\ndescend into night skies that are a\nstargazer\u2019s paradise. There are plenty\nof great hiking options along the\nmountain range, achieved either on\nhorseback or on foot. Meanwhile sun\nand surf worshippers will be satisfied\nwith Pichilemu, just under two\nhours from Santa Cruz and \u201cwidely\nconsidered the best surfing in South\nAmerica year-round\u201d by Fodor\u2019s.\nColchagua is a destination that is\ngaining traction every year, and one\nthat is well worth discovering while it\nis still within its prime.\nRecommended wineries\nVisiting a handful of wineries is\nclearly the main event in Colchagua.\nThe area does continue to maintain\nan air of reserve \u2013 only a handful\nof wineries are currently open to\nthe public \u2013 but I believe that this\nonly adds to Colchagua\u2019s charm and\nhidden gem status. The following\nwineries are an excellent starting\npoint that will provide you with a\nsolid grounding in what the region\nhas to offer, including the essential\ngrape varietals, as well as the contrast\nbetween industrial operations and\nsmaller-scale outfits.\nMontes Winery: This boutique\nwinery is located in the heart of\nApalta, an area synonymous with\noutstanding quality and prestige.\nThey are also the outfit behind\nChile\u2019s first ultra-premium wine,\nAlpha M. Throughout the winery\nwhat stands out is the astounding\nattention to detail: the building has\nbeen oriented about the surrounding\nlandscape according to the principles\nof feng shui, while one of Montes\u2019\nbottles features exclusive artwork\nfrom Gerald Scarfe, the revered\nillustrator behind the iconic cover of\nPink Floyd\u2019s The Wall. The carbon-neutral winery also has an attached\nconservation area dedicated to\npreserving local flora and fauna;\nmeanwhile the barrels receive the soft\nwhisper of round-the-clock Gregorian\nchant to give them \u2013 quite literally \u2013\nnon-stop good vibes.\nThe Colchagua Museum\nAs I alluded to earlier, the activities\nin Colchagua don\u2019t start and end with\nthe wonderful wine. Located just off\nSanta Cruz\u2019s main square, the Plaza\nde Armas, sits Museo Colchagua,\nThe rolling green hills of Montes Winery. Photo: Chris Richardson\nCruising through\nColchagua\none of the continent\u2019s best private\ncollections, boasting well-decked\nexhibition halls inside a huge colonial\nbuilding with a stunning courtyard\nattached. The museum encompasses\nall one could wish to know about\nChile and elsewhere on the continent,\nincluding palaeontology, pre-Columbian art, the colonial era, and\nsubsequent liberation. It is well worth\na few hours \u2013 if not a few days \u2013 of\nyour time in Colchagua: everything\nis beautifully presented, and finding\nexactly what you want is made easy by\nfollowing the guided circuit through\nthe halls.\nBy far the most impressive\ncollection is \u2018The Big Rescue\u2019, a series\nof rooms and tunnels dedicated to\nrecounting the tale of \u2018los 33\u2019, the 33\nChilean men trapped in the San Jos\u00e9\nmine in 2010, an event that captured\nthe eyes and hearts of billions around\nthe globe. The owners and curators\nhave done a fantastic job of securing\nendless memorabilia from the mine\nitself, and presenting it in such a way\nthat really captures the severity and\nscale of this iconic event. While there\nare endless attractions throughout\nColchagua, the Museo certainly is a\nmust-see.\nColchagua Wine Tours\nColchagua as a tourist destination\nis still somewhat in its infancy. As a\nresult sourcing reliable information\nand professional tour guides is\nsomething of a challenge, particularly\nif you\u2019re looking for a good level\nof spoken English. Thankfully the\nregion is now served by a local tour\noperator, Colchagua Wine Tours. It\nwould be difficult to reduce CWT to a\nsingle unique selling point: they offer\ncompletely-customisable tailored\ntour packages, knowledgeable native\nEnglish-speaking guides, and a well\nthought-out pricing system that far\nsurpasses that offered by rival tour\noperators in Santiago. It\u2019s a rarity\nto find such a good level of service,\nand I have no doubts that CWT will\ncontribute to Colchagua\u2019s continuing\nrise to stardom.\nI first ran into CWT\u2019s co-founder\nConnie, a US expat, at a wine harvest\nfestival in a small town in the heart\nof Colchagua, and found her to\ncapture the spirit of CWT perfectly:\nenthusiastic, personable, and busy\ninvestigating up-and-coming trends\nin the area. Coupled with co-founder\nFrancisco \u2013 the Chilean-born\nentrepreneur with a real passion for\nputting home-grown businesses on\nthe map \u2013 CWT offer unparalleled\nknowledge and an unrivalled quality\nof service. Having spent a weekend\nwith them in the area, I was extremely\nimpressed with their incredible\nattention to deal, ability to seamlessly\nstitch together a complicated\nitinerary, and willingness to adapt the\nplans according to our preferences.\nFor the perfect Colchagua experience,\nCWT is your go-to guide.\n\"The valley\nis nothing\nshort of\nstunning.\"\n\"For the\nperfect\nColchagua\nexperience,\nCWT is\nyour go-to\nguide.\"\nBarrels upon barrels of wine maturing in the Montes\nWinery.

The trip is\napproximately 1-2 hours south of\nSantiago,depending on the day\nand time that you leave.From\nSantiago,take Route 5 South.\nYou\u2019ll pass the cities of Rancagua\nand San Fernando.Take Route\nI-50 (Wine Road-Carretera del\nVino) which leads to Santa Cruz.\nOnce you are on Route I-50,\nSanta Cruz is approximately 41\nkm (25 miles) away.

IC Trail\nRunning \u2013 part of the Cross Country\nand Athletics Club \u2013 got things\nunderway with a trip to the Brecon\nBeacons for the second round of the\nWelsh trail running series, and then\non the following weekend travelled\ndown to Dorking for the Surrey Hills\nRace. Both occasions resulted in\nmultiple podium places and victories\nfor the team, great results all round,\nand a lot of sore legs!\nAfter underground closures caused\nchaos on the last Friday of May, we\ndeparted for Wales slightly later than\nplanned, but still in good spirits. The\nfive team members driving up to\nTalybont-on-Usk in south Wales were\nJames, Ellie, Charlie, Will, and team\ncaptain Simon. Luckily there were no\nfurther delays on our journey, and\nwe arrived at the event centre early\nenough to get a good night\u2019s sleep in\nthe rooms saved for us by James\u2019 dad!\nGetting up early the next morning\nrevealed a beautiful dawn, and\nconditions looked great for the day\u2019s\nracing. Each of the team members\nprepared themselves and their kit in\ntheir own ways \u2013 honed from many\nrace experiences, both good and bad!\nThe first to go were the ultra-runners\nSimon, Charlie and Ellie, and after a\nquick race briefing they were off on\ntheir forty mile plus route shortly\nafter 8:00. With the forecast showing\nrain in the afternoon there was\ncertainly motivation to get round\nquickly. Shortly after, at 8:30, James\nand his dad set off on the marathon\nroute, and then at 9:00 it was finally\ntime for Will to set off on the \u2018short\u2019\nten mile route. All the courses were\ntough routes, with fast starts and\nsignificantly more climbing in\nthe latter halves putting strain on\nalready-tired legs. The start on the ten\nmiler was particularly fast with Will\nleading out; however the competition\nproved too strong, and he was caught\non the main climb, ending up settling\nfor second. Meanwhile, in the longer\nraces, signs for another route had\nbeen put up without the organisers\nknowing, causing a brief period of\nnavigational chaos. Most were back\non track quickly though, and James\nwas soon leading the marathon\nagain after gaining an extra 3km of\ndistance. The race continued onto the\nPen-y-Fan ridge, featuring \u2018the bog\u2019\non the way where the question wasn\u2019t\n\u201cdid you fall in?\u201d, but \u201chow deep?\u201d The\nPen-y-Fan ridge featured many steep\nclimbs and treacherous descents that\nwere almost as tiring, with the total\nclimb and descent \u2013 over 1500m on\nthe marathon and over 3000 on the\nultra \u2013 really testing the competitors.\nJames put in a fantastic finish on the\n\u2018marathon\u2019 to come in a clear winner\nat under four hours despite the extra\ndistance, with his dad finishing first\nveteran just over half an hour later.\nThe ultra was won in a blistering\ntime of six hours and 30 minutes by\na Swedish international runner and\nski mountaineer, with Simon and\nCharlie finishing together at around\nseven hours and 50 minutes, having\nmatched each other the entire way.\nEllie came in a while later, having also\nrun a brilliant and incredibly tough\nrace. Merely moving the next day was\na struggle for all of us!\nAfter a brief week\u2019s recovery\nthe team was off again, down to\nDorking with 17 keen club members\nand alumni to run the Surrey hills\nRace organised by South London\nOrienteers. The first to set off \u2013 at a\nmuch more reasonable time of 10:30\n\u2013 were the runners on the 30km \u2018A\nRace\u2019, who had the task of finding\ntheir way between twelve checkpoints\nspread across the Surrey hills using a\nmap and compass. Six runners from\nImperial were competing in this race:\nWill and Ellie (having not decided\nthat last weekend was enough\u2026);\nalumni Jack and Sophie; and fresher\nLily and her friend Lucie. Knowing\nthe strenuous challenge ahead, all\nopted for a steady start up the first\nhill. All that is except for Jack and\nWill, who decided to play \u2018king of\nthe hill\u2019 and sprinted off at full gas.\nLots of laughs and some \u201clook at\nthose idiots\u201d were heard in the field\nbehind them. A few minutes later\nthe 10km \u2018C Race\u2019 runners were off.\nChris Thomas had a strong race\nand was smashing it up all the hills,\nbut a late navigational error cost\nhim the win. Fellow competitors\nLiam and Tom came in 3rd\nand 4th\n,\nrunning a great race despite the\ntough conditions but were outfoxed\nby the navigational skills of the two\nleaders. Finally the \u2018B Race\u2019 was\noff ten minutes later, with James\nand Simon solving the navigation\nproblem by simply following right\nbehind the leader, before sprinting\nthe finish \u2013 James received quite a\nridiculously large trophy as a result!\nGreat performances were put in on\nboth of these races by a host of other\nIC runners and alumni, and everyone\nhad fun, both out on the course\nand relaxing in the sun afterwards!\nMeanwhile in the \u2018A Race\u2019 Will and\nJack had (surprisingly) held onto\ntheir early lead, and after a series\nof steep climbs (including one that\nended in a scramble up on all fours)\nand were in 1st\nand 3rd\nat the halfway\npoint. A poor route choice shortly\nafter this turned a 30 second lead\ninto a 30 second chase \u2013 showing just\nhow important the navigation can\nbe \u2013 and as fatigue (and the results\nof a night out) set in in the latter\nparts of the race Will eventually was\ncaught again and came 3rd\nwith Jack\nfinishing strongly to claim 4th\n. Sophie\nand Ellie both ran great races, the two\nof them crossing the line together,\ncoming joint 2nd\nwomen. Lily and\nLucie also ran together and had a\ngreat day\u2019s running, despite it being\nthe toughest race they\u2019ve ever done! A\nbig congratulations to everyone who\ncompeted, and once again there were\na lot of sore legs on the way home!\nAfter these and earlier results in\nMarch and April, IC Trail are now\npreparing for more racing over\nthe summer, both in the UK and\nabroad. With the support of our\nsponsors, Raidlight (kit) and Aptonia\n(nutrition), we\u2019ve been able to achieve\nbetter and better results, and hope to\ncontinue this over the year!\nWilliam Jones reports as Imperial put in great performances in Wales and Surrey\nThe Imperial team before the meet at Surrey Hills Photo: ICXC\nCharlie and Simon at the finish line in Wales Photo: ICXC\n\n"

You puff out\nyour chest, flatten your pitiful\nneck beard and engage her\nin flirtatious conversation.\nBefore long she has your\nnumber and bank details and\nyou are condemned to donate\nyour monthly stipend to a\ncharity for cats.\nHOROSCOPES\nLEO\nPISCES\nAQUARIUS\nCAPRICORN\nSAGITTARIUS\nSCORPIO\nLIBRA\nGEMINI\nTAURUS\nARIES\nThis week you notice that\nseveral Imperial students on\nyour course appear to have\neye injuries. You offer them\nyour hand in solidarity, before\nnoticing the white bones of\nyour knuckles. It turns out\nthat you have become the\nmanifestation of Death and\nwhomever you touch dies\nimmediately.\nThis week you are an\nanonymous reader of\nhoroscopes. Inspired by\nHangman\u2019s call to action, you\nsend in all twelve horoscopes\nand demand they be printed.\nHangman respects that.\nHangman has printed two of\nthem as a token of this respect.\nThis week you are Hangman.\nYou receive all twelve\nhoroscopes from a new writer,\nbut most of them are so weird\nthat you\u2019re unsure whether to\nprint them. You opt instead to\nprint a mixture of the original\nwriter\u2019s, the new writer\u2019s, and\nyour own. You are promptly\nfired for doing a terrible job.\nThis week you are the\nhoroscopes writer, and you try\nand sneak another relatively\nunacceptable horoscope past\nHangman with the phrase \u201clol\ni bet this one gets taken out.\u201d\nHangman fires you and\nreplaces you with someone\nwho knows how to use the shift\nkey.\nThis week you, too, are the\nhoroscopes writer. You claim to\nhave returned, but only write\nhalf the horoscopes.\nHangman doesn\u2019t pay you to\nhalf-ass this crap. Hangman\ndoesn\u2019t pay you at all.\nThis week you decide you need\nsomeone to look after your\nfinances since you need to save\na few quid for next year so you\nlook around for an accountant.\nLuckily there\u2019s an ex-FIFA\npresident in dire need of a job,\nand you end your second year\nwith an inexplicably larger\nsum of money.\nThis week your friend finally\ncomes out from the cave in\nwhich he entrenched himself\nfor revision, only for you to\nrealise he has become a mole\nin this time. At first it is a very\nconfusing transition for you\nto accept him as a mole but\neventually you learn to feed it\nworms and you grow to love it.\nThis week due to the fact that\nyou have spent so much time\nrevising really hard for your\nfirst year exam because it\u2019s\nextra important, you decide to\nbrag to other people about how\nmuch revision you did in one\nday. They from there on avoid\nyou because you\u2019re a boring\nobnoxious cunt but oh dem\nsweet marks.\nThis week you really fuck up\non your exams. Shit man, you\nprobably should have revised\na bit harder. I mean, you\ncouldn\u2019t answer one question\non that paper? Fuck. Looks like\nyou will be taking a gap year\nwhilst Imperial decide if they\nwant to let you back in.\nThis week the usual writer is\nwriting the horoscopes due to\nHangman being salty af due\nto the fact you had exams and\neven though you definitely\ntold them in advance you\nweren\u2019t doing them because\nyou had exams but it turns out\nthey don\u2019t seem to remember\nthat.\nThis week in response to\nthe findings of last week\u2019s\nsex survey, you realise that\nyou haven\u2019t been fingered\nanywhere on campus and\nset out to try to correct this;\nhowever, it seems that the Felix\nEditor had the same idea and\nunfortunately they seem to be\nthere before you everytime.\nSpooky.\nDiary Of a Fresher, aged 19 1/4\nSaturday 6th June\nI don\u2019t really remember what happened on Friday night, to be honest. After reading about the goat-woman-man\nthreesome in the sex survey I felt really ill, so I went to 568 and just started drinking. I think Kris tried to\napologise to me at one point, but I just tried to punch him.\nSomeone told me that I missed, punched Dorothy (the goat one) instead, and then she kicked me in the face.\nThat\u2019d probably explain why I think I\u2019m missing two of my front teeth. It\u2019s really painful and every time I breathe\nit makes a weird whistling noise.\nSunday 7th June\nI spent most of the day curled up in bed whistling quietly. It was crap.\nMonday 8th June\nWell, there\u2019s good news and there\u2019s bad news. I tried submitting one of those \u2018mitigating circumstances\u2019 forms\nso that I don\u2019t get killed by the lecturers for doing such a shit job in the exams. I still can\u2019t believe I wrote the\nwords \u2018Kris Kraye\u2019 over and over.\nI wonder if \u2018DP(W) stole both my girlfriends\u2019 is an okay reason to have failed all my exams?\nTuesday 9th June\nApparently it isn\u2019t. I put in my application, and I got an email from the official DP(W) email account telling me that\nhe was taken my concerns into consideration and hoped I felt better soon. And that Dorothy (both of them) said hi.\nWhat a dick.\nNEWS WITHOUT THE NEWS\nHangman accused of being \u201ctoo\ncheeky\u201d by FIFA ex-President\nImage deemed \u201cworth\nprinting\u201d by Hangman\nNews in Brief: Broadcasters in terror of slip-ups as man\nnamed \u2018Hunt\u2019 makes headlines again.\nNo-one was surprised today\nwhen it was revealed that\nopening a theme park filled\nwith live dinosaurs is actually a\nterrible idea. Footage has leaked to\nthe outside world showing dinosaurs\nrunning amok at Jurassic World, a\nrecently-opened theme park located\non the remote Isla Nubar.\nConcerns had been voiced\npreviously about the logic behind\nthe decision to not only bring back\ndinosaurs but to also then cage them\nand put them on display, with several\nexperts pointing out the inherent\nflaws in keeping intelligent animals\ncaged.\nThe original owners of the park\nhad hoped to maintain control of\nthe population by keeping only\none gender of dinosaur in the park,\nalthough this plan was soon disrupted\nby the dinosaurs still finding a way\nto breed.\nSeveral experts were invited to\nthe park before it opened to test the\nviability of such a theme, although\nthe results of their tests have never\nbeen disclosed to the outside world.\nRumours that the tests involved\nseveral individuals being eaten by\ndinosaurs remain unconfirmed.\nInformation on this latest\noutbreak at the park is slim, although\nHangman has heard that famous film\nstar Chris Pratt is on location.\nThere was an outpouring\nof shock today as several\nstudents were arrested for their\nparticipation in a nude photoshoot.\nPolice swooped on the unsuspecting\nstudents during the early hours of\nThursday morning, following their\nsuspected attendance at Imperial\nCollege Union\u2019s \u201cCSP Wednesday\u201d\nthat night.\nThe photoshoot in question took\nplace several days before the arrest,\nwith the participants originally\nseeming to believe they had escaped\nrepercussions. One posted \u201cteaser\u201d\nshots from the photoshoot on social\nmedia, before \u201ctaunting\u201d those who\ncomplained about the photoshoot\u2019s\nlocation.\nThe photos are alleged to have\nbeen taken atop the sacred Blackett\nLaboratory, causing a campus-wide\noutcry at the student\u2019s actions.\nSaid one anonymous Felix Editor:\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the photos in question, and\nI was disgusted. They didn\u2019t even take\nit all off. If you\u2019re going to take naked\npics on top of Blackett, at least get\nproperly naked.\u201d\nHangman spoke to one of the\nstudents involved in the photoshoot,\nwho asked not to be named (but\ndid encourage us to print the photo\nagain).\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t mean to cause any\noffence,\u201d said the anonymous\nnudist. \u201cWe were told we had to do a\ncentrefold for Felix, and we thought\nthat the roof of Blackett would be a\ngreat place to take the photo. You get\nsome really great views.\u201d\nHangman would like to take this\nopportunity to confirm that the\nphotos do indeed allow you to get\nsome really great views of [You\u2019re fired\n- Ed.]\nThe police finally made moves on\nthe students following the publication\nof the photos in Felix.\nRumours that the students\u2019\nactions are being blamed for\nthe recent unexpected spate of\nunnaturally warm weather are as yet\nunconfirmed.\nThe President of Imperial\nCollege Union stepped down\ntoday, following widespread\naccusations of corruption within\nthe organisation and the subsequent\narrests of several members of his\nstaff.\nImperial College Union (or ICU, as\nit is often referred to) has long had a\nreputation for what has at times been\nreferred to as \u2018wheeler-dealing\u2019, with\nalleged instances of bribery being rife.\nEvents came to a head when the\norganisation attempted to run a poll\nasking students what they thought\nthe new bar in the Woodward Halls\nshould be called.\nThe halls themselves were a major\nsource of contention, with students\ncampaigning vigorously against\nrelocating accommodation to Acton\nto little avail.\nPolice moved in after an\nanonymous source tipped them off\nto this latest instance of unmitigated\ncorruption and anti-democratic\nprinciples.\nSeveral members of staff were\nplaced under arrest in a surprise sting,\ntimed by officers to coincide precisely\nwith an all-staff meeting.\nThe meeting in question, Hangman\nhas learned, was called to discuss the\naccusations of corruption, causing\nsome observers to comment on the\nirony of being arrested for corruption\nat such a meeting.\nAlthough the investigation\ncontinues, after being given special\ndispensation by the courts Hangman\ncan now exclusively reveal that the\nbar\u2019s name had already been decided,\nlong before the poll was opened to\nstudents.\nOfficials at the Union had decided\nthat the bar was to be dubbed the\n\u2018It\u2019s O\u2019Kaye Bar\u2019, in honour of\nsitting Deputy President (Hugs and\nTampons), Kris Kraye, who is also the\nincoming Deputy President (Money\nand Swag).\nIt has been suggested that this\nchoice was influenced by a monthly\ndonation from a still-anonymous\nsource, rumoured to be someone\nhigh-up within the Union itself.\nDespite this, the Union went ahead\nwith their poll, claiming that the\nstudent voice would be heard in the\ndecision, and insisting that \u201cevery\nvote counts!\u201d\nHangman took their information\non the new bar name to the student\npopulation, asking their opinions\non both the name and the Union\u2019s\nattempts at hiding their choice in\nfaux-democracy.\nOne student asked us to only refer\nto him by his first name, Deputy\nPresident, and told Hangman: \u201cI\nthink the new name is a fantastic\ndecision by the Union. Naming the\nbar after the champion of the people\nKris Kraye is a magnificent move,\nand I can think of no other who is as\ndeserving as he to have an entire bar\nnamed after him.\nThe student was less forthcoming\nwhen Hangman pressed him on the\nclaims of corruption in the process,\nreplying only \u201cwhat do you care if I\npaid them to name it after me?\n\u201cBloody Felix, always sticking their\nnose in other people\u2019s business.\u201d\nHangman wishes to take this\nopportunity to agree firmly with\nthe sentiments expressed by Deputy\nPresident, as Felix are indeed far too\nnosy for their own good.\nHangman would also like to point\nout that Hangman and Felix aren\u2019t the\nsame thing, thank you very much.\nStripping students arrested for\ndesecrating sacred monument\nDinosaur theme park\napparently bad idea\nPresident steps down amid corruption claims\nBlackett Laborary, the sacred monument allegedly deserated by stripping students.

This cost\nincludes rehabilitation fees and\ntrauma care, as well as prosthetic\nlimbs.\nThe centre, which is located at\nImperial College London, raised\nconcern over the cost, which they say\nmay be underestimated because of the\npotential need to replace prosthetics\nin the future, as well as other illnesses\n(both experienced by all citizens)\nas well as injuries specific to bomb-related injuries.\nThe Royal British Legion also\nfelt that the cost of care has been\nunderestimated up until now.\nHowever, the researchers hope that\nthe study will help in planning for\nthe costs of care in the longer term.\nAdditionally, avenues for future\nresearch into the long-term effects of\nblast injuries have been identified.\nThis study has been praised by Sue\nFreeth, the Director of Operations at\nthe Royal British Legion.\nShe said, \u201cThis is the first attempt\nwe know of to publish an independent\nestimate of the lifetime healthcare\ncost of the British service personnel\nseriously injured by IEDs [improvised\nexplosive devices] in Afghanistan.\n\u201cThis paper should alert health\ncommissioners to the scale of the\nproblem, and help them to plan ahead\nto meet the lifetime health care needs\nof this generation.\u201d\nThe Royal British Legion Centre\nfor Blast Injury Studies was opened\nby Prince Harry in 2013. The centre\nis the first in the United Kingdom\nwhere civilian researchers work with\nmilitary doctors.\nThe centre performs research into\npossible methods of reducing the\neffects of bomb injuries, such as those\ncaused by IEDs.\nPrince Harry opened the Centre for Blast Injury Studies in 2013. Photo:\nImperial College London\nPHILIP KENT\nDEPUTY EDITOR\nTransport for London\nto accept Apple Pay\nTransport for London have\nannounced that they will\naccept Apple Pay when it\nlaunches in the UK in July.\nThe move makes TfL the first\npublic transport operator to accept\nthe mobile payment technology.\nThe announcement follows Apple\u2019s\nconfirmation that Apple Pay will be\nmaking its way to Britain. At Apple\u2019s\nWorldwide Developer Conference\n(WWDC) in San Francisco last week\nit was also confirmed that Apple\nPay will be available to customers\nof nearly all of the UK\u2019s banks, with\nBarclays being the notable omission.\nThe service still requires an iPhone 6\nor Apple Watch.\nApple have stated that Apple Pay\nwill also be supported at a number\nof other retailers, including Boots,\nMarks and Spencer, the Post Office\nand Waitrose, however the near field\ncommunication (NFC) technology\nused by Apple means that any retailer\nwhich accepts contactless payments\nwill accept Apple Pay as well.\nTfL have confirmed that Apple Pay\nusers will receive the same benefits\nas contactless card users, such as\nMonday to Sunday fare capping,\nwhich is currently unavailable on\nOyster.\nTfL have reiterated their\ncommitment to not phase out Oyster\nand to bring all the benefits currently\nenjoyed by contactless users, such as\nMonday to Sunday fare capping, to\nOyster customers as well.\nMeanwhile, Google has announced\nAndroid Pay, a very similar service\nto Apple Pay but specific to Android\ndevices. Like Apple Pay, the\ntechnology makes use of the same\nNFC technology meaning that when\nit launches in the UK, Android Pay\nwill also likely work on TfL services.\nThe news comes as TfL\u2019s\ncontroversial plan to close Tube\nticket offices takes pace. At time\nof writing, ticket offices have been\nclosed at a number of tube stations\nincluding Gloucester Road and West\nKensington. The ticket office at South\nKensington is scheduled to close at\nsome point between October and\nDecember.\nSome stations are to gain a\nreplacement \u201cVisitor Information\nCentre\u201d which will sell travel tickets\nas well as tickets to enter London\nattractions. The first centre recently\nopened at King\u2019s Cross St. Pancras\nstation near the Eurostar terminal.\nPHILIP KENT\nDEPUTY EDITOR\n\"Apple Pay\nusers will\nreceive\nthe same\nbenefits as\ncontactless\ncard users\"\nPhysics exams plagued by multiple errors,\nincluding setting an \u201cimpossible question\u201d\nContinued from front page...\nJaffe also told Felix that he wished\n\u201cto apologise for the error,\u201d and\npromised, \u201cWe will ensure that the\nexam is marked fairly.\u201d\nThe senior tutor for the Physics\ndepartment also offered his apologies\nfor the errors within the exam in the\nsame email.\nSpeaking to one student, they told\nFelix how classmates were feeling\ndisappointed that exams are being\nchecked \u201cso poorly\u2019\u201d and that some\nalso feel they have been \u201clied to by the\ndepartment regarding the quality of\nproofreading.\u201d\nSaid another student: \u201cI\u2019ve now sat\ntwo consecutive exams that have been\nriddled with errors, both needing\nseveral corrections mid-exam, which\nis detrimental to students being able\nto focus.\n\u201cThe Quantum Mechanics exam\ncontained several typographical\nerrors, driving some students to\ndisbelieving laughter as more and\nmore corrections had to be explained\nto the cohort.\n\u201cThe Imperial physics department\nyet again shows how much they care\nabout research over the students.\u201d\nOne student was keen to point\nout that this may not be the fault of\njust one individual. They told Felix:\n\u201cAndrew Jaffe is a very competent\nlecturer, and was very apologetic\nabout the whole situation.\n\u201cI can understand that sometimes\nit\u2019s hard to see errors in your own\nwork, and thin that this is a problem\nwith the system rather than with the\nlecturer.\u201d\nAnother remained pessimistic,\nstating: \u201cThe department doesn\u2019t\nreally care too much for student\nwelfare anyway so other than feeling\nembarrassed as a whole it probably\nwon\u2019t do anything regardless of\nstudent consensus.\u201d\nSaid another: \u201cThe mistake was\ncompletely unacceptable; it could\nhave been avoided if a single person\nhad attempted to do the question.\u201d\nThis has not been the only\nissue with exams for Physics\nundergraduates this term; a Physics\nundergraduate representative made\na \u201cformal complaint\u201d via email to\nthe Head of the Physics department,\nJordan Nash, on the \u201cunacceptably\npoor nature\u201d of the Comprehensive\npaper that was sat earlier on in term,\non the 6th\nof May.\nThe email complaint stated how the\nComprehensive paper \u201ccontained no\nfewer than three large errors,\u201d which\nwe spotted and corrected mid-exam.\nThese errors included a missing\npower function in an equation that\nThis has not been the only issue for Physics undergraduate students this term. Photo: Imperial College London\nWhat checks\ndo exam\nscripts go\nthrough?\nFelix spoke to a faculty member of\nthe physics department,who has\nbeen working at Imperial for ten\nyears.He told us that after working\nat several institutions across the\nworld,he was most impressed by\nthe level of scrutiny exam papers\ngo through before a student sits\nthem,and the analysis process\nafterwards to ensure marking is\nfair too.\nHe told us how the exam script\ngoes to a Course Associate first,\nwho checks the script and gives\nfeedback on the questions before\nthe revised exam script is sent to an\nexternal Examiner.\nHe explained how along with\nthe script,the lecturer will provide\ndetailed information on how the\nexam is designed,along with\nsolutions.\u201cThey receive a lot of\ninformation about the exam,so\ncan provide a lot of opinions on the\nexam script.\u201d\nThese Examiners are academics\noutside of the institution,and\nalthough these external examiners\nare not\u201cexperts in every field,\u201dthey\ndo give detailed feedback on the\nexam.\nWhen the changes are relayed\nback to the lecturer,they then need\nto report that the changes have\nbeen put in place.\nHe said that typos will slip\nin from time to time,but it is\nuncommon for mistakes to be\nmade within the actual theory of\nthe questions.\n\u201cI have a lot of sympathy for\ntypos when they manage to sneak\nin,but if the mistake is one of\nactual physics I would actually be\nsurprised.\u201d\nHowever,having people sit\nthe exam beforehand to check\nfor these mistakes isn\u2019t probably\nthe answer either:\u201cThe [exam\nchecking] system is so labour\nintensive,that I think it would not\nbe a feasible thing to do,unless we\npaid post docs to do it.\u201d\nAfter the exam,the faculty\nmembers of the department meet\nto discuss the exam papers in late\nJune.\u201cEverything is gone through\nin extreme detail.It is a massive\namount of work.\u201d\nHe did state though that with\nall the checkpoints in place,the\noverall effect of such a question\nlike the one in the QM paper\nshouldn\u2019t be too great. \u201cThe actual\nimpact,as bad as it is to have that\nhappen and as frustrated it is to\nhave that happen,\n\u201cI would be surprised if it had as\nnegative an impact as they may\nfeel now.\u201d\nstudents were required to prove, and a\nset of constraints about pressure in a\nsystem that were incorrect.\nDr. Bob Forsyth, the Director of\nUndergraduate studies, responded to\nthe formal complaint, stating that he\nhad confirmed with the Chair of the\nComprehensive exam panel that the\npaper had passed through all of the\nchecking stages, including the script\nbeing sent to an external examiner\nbeforehand.\nSaid Forsyth in his response: \u201cThe\nerrors on this paper were taken very\nseriously by the examiners during\nthe exam, and all efforts have been\nmade in the marking to ensure that\nno student has suffered in their result\ndue to the typographical errors.\u201d\nHe concluded that also it would be\nimpossible to guarantee every exam\npaper in the future will be 100% error\nfree, but he agreed that exam errors\nshould be an exception.\nHe assured the representative that\nhe would raise the general issue at a\nTeaching Committee meeting in the\nfuture.\nForsyth also told Felix: \u201cI would like\nto take this opportunity to reassure\nall students that, where errors\nhave occurred, our examiners do\neverything possible to ensure that no\nstudents are disadvantaged in their\nresults.\u201d\nTwo Comprehensive exams are sat\nin third year, and together they are\nworth a third of the year\u2019s weighting\noverall. The exams cover all topics\ntaught in both second and first year.\nOver the term, there has been a\nreported total of 17 issues across\nvarious exams, affecting modules\nacross all year groups. Issues have\nreportedly included poor quality\nimages being difficult to decipher,\nincorrect units and potential energy\nvalues, and various typos.\nAn accumulation of mistakes\nresulted in the complaints being\nrelayed to the Faculty of Natural\nSciences Teaching staff. Third year\nrepresentative Ben Fernando met\nwith the staff Monday morning.\nIn an email to the rest of his year\ngroup, Fernando stated that the staff\nwill be conducting an investigation\ninto the examination errors, and\nthat \u201cthey have promised a speedy\nresponse.\u201d\nSaid Fernando: \u201cI am inclined not\nto pass comment but in the interests\nof transparency I can confirm that\nmy actions as year rep included\nsending a number of emails to the\ndepartment staff, both before and\nafter exams, highlighting concerns\nabout procedure.\nAs there were a significant number\nthat received no reply the issue was\nraised to a faculty level. I am led to\nbelieve an investigation is on-going\nand I\u2019ve made the department aware\nof at least 17 errors or issues with\nexaminations papers affecting 10\npapers.\u201d\nThis follows mistakes being made\nin an assessed problem sheet and\na maths revision test sat at the\nbeginning of the year, which after\nbeing highlighted to the department\nby students, were initially deemed too\ninsignificant to be rectified.\nSecond year students were told to\n\u201ctake it on the chin\u2026it\u2019s a drop in the\nocean,\u201d by a senior teaching fellow,\nwhich caused further complaints.\nThe Department of Physics was\nranked 8th\noverall in the UK in\nthe recent Guardian League table,\nalthough came in at 27th\nwhen\nranked according to overall student\nsatisfaction.\n\n"

    "content": "18 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n12.06.2015\nWelfare\nfelix.welfare@imperial.ac.uk Welfare Editors Diba Esbati & Chanon Wongsatayanont\nDon\u2019t keep it all bottled up\nAfew weeks ago, the results of\na College-wide mental health\nsurvey was released on Felix.\nAt first glance, the numbers\nlooked scary where 75% out of\n1115 respondents said that they\u2019d\nexperienced unhealthy amounts of\nstress and mental health symptoms\nsometime during their time in\nImperial.\nIt is more comforting to see the\nfigures concerning help they have\nsought out.\nTo give a recap on some numbers,\nmore than half of sufferers said that\nthey confided in friends, 20% said\nthey saw a GP and 13% said that they\napproached their personal tutor for\nhelp regarding this.\nUnfortunately, 28% said that\nthey didn\u2019t disclose their stress or\ncondition with anyone.\nIn addition to this, 16% suspected\nthat they have a mental illness but\nare yet to be diagnosed, which is only\nslightly different to the percentage\nof those who have already been\nmedically diagnosed (20%).\nCombined with the number of\nrespondents who spoke to no one\nabout their stress, this suggests that\nthere is a lonely group who did not\nreceive any help for their conditions.\nI think there are a number of\npossible reasons for this: Help might\nnot be visible enough, which is\nsomething currently being addressed\nby Mentality.\nSome people might prefer to deal\nwith the stress and their condition on\ntheir own.\nOr finally, seeking help of any\nkind is a terrifying prospect,\nwhether because of the stigma\nsurrounding mental illnesses or fear\nof dramatising themselves.\nThe last reason is the topic I want to\ntalk about this week.\nIt\u2019s a scary feeling when you want\nhelp but are stopped by real or\nimagined pressure, because it\u2019s not\na visible problem that can be easily\nresolved.\nIt\u2019s a kind of isolation and\nloneliness that can\u2019t be explained to\nothers because it seems to go against\nevery instinct to talk about it. An\nexample will show you what I mean.\nSay, you\u2019re suffering from a case\nof depression but you don\u2019t know\nabout it. Every once in a while, you\nwill enter an episode that makes\neverything seem pointless and\nunachievable for days on end, even if\nthis is something as simple as getting\nout of bed. You suspect it might be\ndepression, but you quickly shoot\nAdmitting that you are suffering from a mental illness can be just as nerve-wracking as admitting you\u2019re gay.\nPhoto: noringnosheets.com\nChanon Wongsatayanont explains why seeking\nhelp for mental illness can be tough\n\"Mental\nillness\ncan be a\nconfusing\nand\nisolating\nexperience\nwhich\nmakes\nseeking help\nharder than\nit seems\"\n\"If your\nsocial circle\nhas a stigma\nfor mental\nillness,\nconfiding\nto them is\nlike coming\nout to a\ngroup of\nhomophobic\nfriends.\"\nMental health\nhelplines and\nresources\nIf you are concerned about your\nown mental health or that of a\nloved one,there are people out\nthere you can talk to who can\ngive you advice,or will be there\nto listen.\nHelplines\nIf you are distressed and need\nsomeone to talk to :\nSamaritans (24 hr helpline)\nPhone: 08457 90 90 90\nwww.samaritans.org.uk\nAnxiety Help :\nAnxiety UK\nPhone: 08444 775 774\n(Mon-Fri 09:30-17:30)\nwww.anxietyuk.org.uk\nNo Panic\nPhone: 0808 800 2222\n(daily,10:00-22:00)\nwww.nopanic.org.uk\nEating Disorders:\nBeat\nPhone: 0845 634 1414\n(Mon-Thurs,13:30-16:30)\nAddiction:\nAlcoholics Anonymous\nPhone: 0845 769 7555\n(24 hour helpline)\nwww.alcoholics-anonymous.org.uk\nNarcotics Anonymous\nPhone: 0300 999 1212\nwww.ukna.org\nCollege Resources\nStudent Counselling Service\nPhone: 020 7594 9637\ne-mail: counselling@ic.ac.uk\nImperial College Health Centre\nTelephone: 020 7584 6301\ne-mail: healthcentre@ic.ac.uk\nYou can also go to your academic\nor personal tutor regarding\npastoral issues,especially if you\nthink your mental health might\nbe affecting your academic\nperformance.\ndown the thought, dismissing it as the\nblues everyone talks about.\nSo of course you wouldn\u2019t talk to\nanyone about it since it\u2019s nothing,\nright?\nBut the suffering is real. Weeks and\nweeks go by and these terrible phases\ncome back.\nYou still think it\u2019s the blues and\nyou\u2019re more sensitive than everyone\nelse because you can\u2019t get out of it like\neveryone else can.\nBy blaming yourself for being\noverly dramatic, you bottle it up even\nmore, putting up a wall so no one\nwould judge you.\nEven if you know your friends\nwould be sympathetic, you don\u2019t want\nto risk the misunderstanding.\nIf your social circle has a stigma\nfor mental illness, confiding to\nthem is like coming out to a group of\nhomophobic friends.\nOne difference in the analogy\nhowever. While homosexuality is\na usually concrete where you feel\nattracted to guys or girls, mental\nillness has a lot of overlap with\neveryday emotions and it\u2019s sometimes\nhard to draw the line between them.\nComing back to my original point,\nexperiencing a mental illness can be\na confusing and isolating experience\nwhich makes seeking help harder\nthan it seems.\nBecause of stigma and fear of\nmisunderstanding, there is a vast gap\nbetween self-diagnosis and going to\nthe health centre for an actual one, or\nseeking any help at all.\nTo bridge this gap, there are the call\ncentres on the side of this page.\nSome of these numbers, such as the\nSamaritans, are operated by trained\nsupporters who can give advice or just\nlisten, depending on what the caller\nprefers.\nThe best thing about these services\nis the anonymity. That way, sufferers\nwon\u2019t have to be afraid of judgments\nor consequences after confiding in\nsomeone else.\nAfter calling them, the sufferer\nwould hopefully know more about\nwhat they\u2019re going through, without\nhaving to confront the wall they set\nup for themselves because they\u2019re\ntalking to trained strangers.\nThen with that information, it is\nmuch easier to decide whether they\nstill want to seek out help as they\nnow have a second opinion, which\nis invaluable when you already\nhave a whirlwind of doubts and\nunconfirmed fears in your head.\nRegardless of your choice,\ncontacting call centres would be a\nhelpful and harmless first step to\nhowever you choose to deal with the\nstress you experience.\n\n"

Turns out it\u2019s set in Wales, too.\nDefinitely didn\u2019t know that.\nThe set does nothing to help give\nany clues about what\u2019s going on: rings\nof plastic garden chairs surround the\nstage space, bordered by a knee-high\nwall.\nInside, the contents of the living\nroom of a dingy flat sit. A couple of\nDoctor Who toys sit, one unopened,\none not. A few Doctor Who DVDs sit\nunderneath a TV set. Dangling above\nthe set are fluorescent lights, arranged\nin a hexagon. It looks suspiciously\nlike it might be borrowing design\ninspiration from a certain time-travelling blue box.\nIf, like me, you\u2019re starting to sense\na theme here, you\u2019re correct. Doctor\nWho plays a big part in this show \u2013 at\nleast, it does to begin with.\nThe lights dim, and Liam (David\nMorst) appears, dressed as Matt\nSmith\u2019s Doctor.\nHe waves a sonic screwdriver\naround, and the lights descend,\nforming a TARDIS-lite console.\nIt\u2019s all a bit silly, a bit weird, a bit\nadorable \u2013 and wholly disarming.\nThis weird dream-state where Liam\nfaffs around in a Doctor Who-based\nstate of mind marks the scene changes\nin the play, allowing for a brief respite\nfrom the intense domestic disputes\nthat otherwise dominate proceedings.\nThey don\u2019t seem to add much, and\nwith designer Cai Dyfan opting for\na static set there\u2019s no real call for\nphysical movements of set \u2013 the only\nchange that ever has to be made is\ndone in the interval anyway.\nThey\u2019re the only weak point in the\nwhole thing, proving to be nothing\nbut a fancy light show acting as a\ndistraction from the real goings-on.\nThe real goings-on in question are\nutterly absorbing, revolving around\nLiam\u2019s relationships with the three\nother members of the cast.\nThere\u2019s Jen (Morfydd Clark), the\npretty girl he clearly has a crush on,\nhis dad Rick (Jason Hughes), with\nwhom he has nothing in common,\nand Suze (Siwan Morris), Rick\u2019s\ncurrent squeeze.\nThe script quickly sets up just who\nthese people are, and how they\u2019ve\ncome to all be in the same flat, and\nthen just as quickly starts pulling\napart the very fabric of that setup.\nNothing is ever exactly what it\nseems in this play, and at every\nmoment there\u2019s a prickling unease\nthat everything could turn, and go\nhorribly, horribly wrong.\nThere\u2019s a spark of wit running\nthrough the whole thing, providing\na gentle humour that gives way\nto horrifying, brutal outbursts,\nbefore just as quickly turning into\nsomething that feels awfully like a\nrom-com.\nIn lesser hands, this could well feel\njarring, a series of constant tonal\nshifts that only serve to throw the\nentire audience off-balance and leave\nthem feeling apart from the action.\nNone of that is the case here.\nThe rapid changing in the way\nthe play presents itself never\nfeels anything less than natural,\nthe delicate power balances and\nrelationships all feeling impossibly\nreal.\nThe relationship between Liam\nand Jen is at the centre of all this,\nconstantly shifting before the\naudience\u2019s eyes.\nAt times cute, at other times\nslightly concerning, it\u2019s also subject to\nthe worrying influence of Rick.\nHis interference in his son\u2019s love\nlife manifests as advice, what he\nwould do if he were Liam, and it all\nsounds horrific. And to begin with,\nit looks like it\u2019s backfired, as Jen runs\nout. But then it very, very quickly\nstarts to piece itself back together, and\nthe scary, overwhelming Rick begins\nto sound like the voice of reason.\nIt\u2019s an initially subtle shift in power\nthat works marvellously, and it\u2019s one\nthat is constantly broken and reforged throughout the play.\nThe underlying plot for much of\nthe play isn\u2019t particularly interesting,\nappearing as just another \u2018boy fancies\ngirl who doesn\u2019t fancy him back\u2019\nstory, but it\u2019s the wonderful way the\nscript handles the characters involve\nthat sell it.\nThe constant, nagging fear that\nRick \u2013 the man who seems so\nwrong, so violent \u2013 might just be the\nman who proves to be right. It\u2019s a\nterrifying thought, and the play tugs\nso insistently on that thread that it\nbecomes all-consuming, impossible\nto ignore.\nThe emotion keeping you trapped\nin your seat slowly changes from\ncuriousity in what will happen next to\nfear of what will come to pass. A well-founded fear, at that.\nIt\u2019s not an easy job for the cast to\nhandle, not least when there are only\nfour of them to begin with.\nEvery member of the cast plays\ntheir part admirably, and these are\nfour flawless performances.\nSiwan Morris is the most shortchanged of the four, with Suze being\nboth the weakest and most thankless\npart.\nSuze\u2019s shifts in opinions feel the\nmost forced, more a result of the\nstory\u2019s needs than a natural character\nprogression, but she handles them\nwell.\nMorfydd Clark is alluring and\nadorable as Jen, while David\nMorst handles his character\u2019s arc\nwonderfully. It\u2019s Jason Hughes\nwho dominates the space, though,\nphysically and otherwise.\nRick is a viciously physical being,\nbut there\u2019s an animalistic intelligence\nbeneath all that \u2013 where Liam is quick\nwith words, Rick is quick with actions.\nThe omnipresent threat that\nRick presents is never undersold by\nHughes, nor is it oversold. It\u2019s played\nperfectly. It\u2019s all played perfectly.\nViolence and Son was in the\nunenviable position of following on\nfrom Who Cares in the Royal Court\u2019s\nJerwood Theatre Upstairs.\nIt\u2019s nowhere near as nakedly\npolitical as that work (which also\nfeatured directing work from Hamish\nPirie, who takes sole directorial\ncontrol here), and it makes very\ndifferent use of the space.\nBut Violence and Son still has\nsomething to say \u2013 originally\nsomething on a far more personal\nlevel, but as the unexpected ending\ncomes crashing in, leaving a trail of\ndestruction in its wake, it lands with a\nmessage that feels painfully urgent.\nIt\u2019s something that needs to be\nscreamed from the rooftops, but to do\nthat, now, would spoil the play.\nIt\u2019s a message that can only be\ndelivered wrapped up in this entire\npackage, as the build-up is as essential\nas the pay-off.\nGo and see it. I urge you.\nViolence and Son is at the Jerwood\nTheatre Upstairs, Royal Court Theatre\nuntil 11th\nJuly.\nTickets from \u00a315 (for students),\navailable online.\nDavid Moorst as Liam, in the Royal Court\u2019s Violence and Son Photo: Helen Maybanks\n\n"

At the stroke of 7pm, the doors\nof the theatre slam shut, sealing us\nin as if inside a tomb, where for the\nfollowing 220 minutes we are - with\nlittle respite - forced to confront\nthe immediacy of evil, revenge, and\nbloody human nature.\nWhile every translator may be a\ntraitor, there is also an element of\nliberation in the act of translation,\nand Icke has used his creative\nfreedom to unlock some of the heavy\nchains attached to the story. The\nmost daring change he has made is to\nintroduce the sacrifice of Iphigenia,\nthe daughter of Klytemnestra and\nAgamemnon, as an actual on-stage\nprocess, rather than something that\nis merely referred to. This first act,\nwhich documents the beginning of\nthe end of the House of Atreus - a\nhouse affected by the ongoing war,\nchallenged by the demands of having\na leader for a father, but happy\nnevertheless; they sit around the\ntable at dinnertime, sing each other\nsongs, and bicker gently - serves to\nexplain the motivations behind the\ncharacters\u2019 later actions, and allows us\nto see how far the family will fall, thus\nmaking their descent into chaos all\nthe more affecting.\nAs time passes, and the war is\nwon, the household - or at least\nKlytemnestra - tries to maintain the\nillusion of normality: the dinner bell\nis still rung, and red wine continues\nto be drunk, as the body count\nincreases, and more and more chairs\nat the table remain unoccupied.\nThese ideas, of ritual and habits,\nplay into the themes of the final act,\nwhere Orestes goes on trial for the\nmurder of Klytemnestra - that most\ntransgressive of crimes: matricide -and the Athenian tradition of a court\nof law, based on the newly founded\nAreopagus, is questioned. With such\nuniversal themes - retributive v\nrestorative justice; the role of the state\nin family matters; the foundations\nof democracy - it is little wonder that\nThe Oresteia still hits hard today.\nInstead of using the ending, in which\nOrestes is pardoned by Athene,\nas an explanation for the ancient\nGreek law of \u2018The Vote of Athene\u2019,\nIcke instead uses it to explore the\nproblems apparent in a democratic\njustice system: \u2018we favour men in all\nthings\u2019, intones Athene, \u2018and as the\njust representative of our society,\nit is appropriate that in this house\nof justice men are favoured\u2019. What\nhappens when the democratic choice\nis the immoral one? Icke leaves these\nquestions unanswered, with Orestes\u2019\nfinal cry of \u2018what do I do?\u2019 echoing\nsociety\u2019s inability to come to a\nconclusion.\nIcke\u2019s decision to remove the\nChorus from the play is a bold one,\nand is reminiscent of the track taken\nby Ivo van Hove in his production of\nAntigone, which recently ran at the\nBarbican Centre. Like van Hove,\nIcke\u2019s production democratises the\nscript, dividing up the role of the\nchorus among the main parts; the\nscript, with its lines running into\nand out of each other, weaving a rich\ntapestry of verse, echoes the idea of\na unified Chorus whilst remaining\nfresh and modern. The lines are\nthrown across the stage back and\nforth, punctuated by heavy pauses\nand the occasional grand speech,\nsuch as Klytemnestra\u2019s monologue\nfollowing the murder of her husband,\nin which she revels in the brutality of\nher actions: \u2018I open my mouth like a\nplant in the rain in the red and I feel\nso awake\u2019.\nGreek theatre is renowned for its\nlarger-than-life female characters:\nMedea, Electra, Hecuba \u2013 any\nactor attempting to take on one of\nthese roles faces an uphill struggle.\nWhat\u2019s more, in this revised version,\nKlytemnestra\u2019s role is even more\nintense, with the on-stage death of\nher daughter adding an increased\nvulnerability to the character.\nHowever, Icke has found a fitting\nKlytemnestra in Lia Williams, who\ninhabits the role completely; within\nWilliams there is a cold gleam of steel\nwhich, only glimpsed at the beginning\nof the play, is slowly revealed, until\nshe is transformed into a cold killer,\nblood glinting in the sunlight. Over\nthe course of the play, we follow\nKlytemnestra from a happy-yet-hardened politician\u2019s wife, through\nto a master adaptor, tossed to and fro\nby the whims of men \u2013 following the\ndeath of her daughter: \u2018I will get up\nat the very first sign of morning, and\nI will make a plan\u2019 \u2013 and finally to a\nwoman in charge of her own destiny;\nsuch a multi-faceted role would\ngive anyone pause for thought, but\nWilliams manages to look deep inside\nherself and deliver.\nSimilarly, Angus Wright\u2019s\nAgamemnon is wonderful, with\nhis stilted, slightly chilly delivery\nencapsulating the inflections of a\npolitician forced to go off script.\nJessica Brown Findlay\u2019s delivery of\nthe character of Electra is excellently\nrealised \u2013 all pent-up fury and\nunreleased grief \u2013 that makes me\nwant to see her take on the role in\nSophocles\u2019 tragedy; the fact that this\nis her stage debut is only all the more\nremarkable.\nHildegard Bechtler\u2019s minimalist\nstage design complements the\nperformance, allowing the script to\nspeak for itself, and accentuating\nthe action. The stone stage, dissected\nby two wide panes of glass, acts as\nsimulacrum of a family home, with\nthe giant marble bathtub \u2013 the\nmurder site of Agamemnon, who was\nprophesied to \u2018die in water\u2019 \u2013 looming\nat the back like an ominous warning.\nBut The Oresteia are not happy\nplays, and this is not a happy home. A\ncertain cold, unfriendly nature runs\nthroughout the house, beginning\nwith the murder of Iphigenia. The\nsterile nature of the sets, alongside\nthe aggressively neutral costume\nchoices \u2013 all grey tones and collarless\nshirts, like the mood board of a Cos\ndesigner \u2013 makes the killing of the\nchild all that more horrifying; and\nthus, Agamemnon\u2019s murder, which\npaints the set with red blood, acts\nalmost like a form of visual catharsis\nfor the audience.\nUnfortunately, there are some\nelements of this adaptation that\ndon\u2019t work as well. Icke\u2019s decision\nto stage the play like a court\nreconstruction makes sense within\nthe context of the last act, and adds\nan interesting lexicon to the script,\nwhich speaks of evidence, witnesses,\nand representatives; however, the\nintroduction of a \u2018Doctor\u2019 character,\nwho we cut to at intervals in the\naction, questioning Orestes, lends\nthe performance a psychoanalytical\nangle that doesn\u2019t suit it. While I\nam not suggesting that the works of\nFreud and Jung do not have a place\nwithin the Greek tradition, the effect\nof this intervention is to spell-out the\nmeaning of the play to the audience,\nas if we are unable to come up with\nconclusions on our own. Similarly,\nIcke\u2019s treatment of Electra\u2019s\ncharacter, which culminates in a Fight\nClub-style twist had me rolling my\neyes somewhat.\nAeschylus\u2019 original Oresteia was a\nradical departure from the original\nHomeric text, which feted Orestes as\na hero to be worshiped.

Photo: Imperial College London\nAFreedom of Information\nrequest by Times Higher\nEducation (THE) has revealed\nthat Imperial College London is\namong around one in six universities\nin the UK to set targets for the\namount of grant money brought in by\nits academics.\nThe practise of setting grant income\ntargets for individuals was scrutinised\nafter the suicide of Stefan Grimm,\na Professor of Toxicology in the\nImperial College Faculty of Medicine,\nlast September.\n93 UK universities responded to\nthe FoI request from THE, which\nasked whether or not they set targets\nof this kind. Of these, 11 universities\nreported that individual grant-winning goals are set for at least some\nmembers of their faculties.\nAnother 12 institutions have targets\nset at institutional, departmental or\nfaculty level; this means that in total\n30 percent of universities set grant\nincome targets of some kind.\nAs well as Imperial, targets are set\nfor individuals at the universities\nof Aberdeen, Dundee, East Anglia,\nGlasgow, Greenwich and Leeds,\nas well as Queen Mary University\nof London, Plymouth University,\nAbertay University and Robert\nGordon University.\nGreenwich, Abertay, Robert\nGordon, Dundee and Leeds\nreportedly stated that these targets\nare set \u201conly on a case-by-case basis\u201d,\nwhile Plymouth and East Anglia say\nthat academics are \u201cencouraged\u201d but\nnot required to bring in the target\namount of grant money, the THE\nreports.\nIn their response, Glasgow said\nthat targets are used alongside other\nmetrics in the criteria looked at when\nconsidering promotions for senior\nlecturers. Meanwhile Aberdeen\nsay that their \u201cexpectations\u201d are\nonly used to inform conversations\nabout \u201cwhich aspects (if any) of an\nindividual\u2019s career might need more\nattention or support to develop\u201d.\nThe universities of Bath, Bradford,\nSurrey, Ulster and Warwick did\nnot respond with the requested\ninformation, claiming that it was\n\u201ccommercially sensitive\u201d.\nHowever in an article last year\nTHE reported that Warwick\nMedical School and the University\nof Warwick School of Life Sciences\nsingle out academics for potential\nredundancy if their research income\nover the previous four years is below\nan average of \u00a390,000 or \u00a375,000\nrespectively.\nAt Imperial, academics are\nexpected to \u201ccover the costs of their\nemployment\u201d with the income\nfrom their research and teaching\nwork. There are also minimum\nperformance standards within some\ndepartments that sometimes include\n\u201ca general statement of the amount\nof income that a researcher\u2026 might\nnormally be expected to generate\u201d.\nThe inquest into the death of\nProfessor Stefan Grimm in April this\nyear heard a report from Imperial\u2019s\ninternal review of staff policies,\nwhich was conducted in response\nto Grimm\u2019s suicide. Senior coroner\nChinyere Inyama noted that funding\nissues were mounting stress on the\nprofessor, who was undergoing an\n\u201cinformal review process\u201d after\n\u201cstruggling to fulfil the metrics\u201d of\nhis post.\nLed by Imperial\u2019s director of\nHuman Resources Louise Lindsay,\nthe review recommended a number of\nchanges including increased support\nfor staff members who are struggling,\nthough Ms Lindsay admitted at the\ninquest that the changes still may not\nhave prevented Grimm\u2019s death.\nMembers of the academic\ncommunity have called out the\npractice of setting grant targets\nfor encouraging \u201coverstretched\u201d\nstaff to take on more projects\nthan they can reasonably manage\nand discriminating against more\ninexpensive research.\nUCL students threatened after rent strikes\nStudents living in accommodation\nrun by University College\nLondon (UCL) have been\nthreatened by the university\nwith serious repercussions after\nwithholding rent due to allegedly\n\u2018unliveable\u2019 conditions in their halls.\nUCL has warned the final year\nstudents that they will not be\npermitted to attend their graduation\nceremony, receive their final results\nor have their degree reported\nunless they settle the outstanding\naccommodation payments.\nReturning students will not\nbe permitted to re-enrol at the\nuniversity until the balance is\npaid off, warns the site manager of\nCampbell House in a letter to those\ntaking part in the strike. Summer\naccommodation offers could also be\nwithdrawn.\nHowever, the accommodation\noffice at UCL has reportedly claimed\nthat this was only a \u2018standard letter\u2019\nwhich is sent out to any student with\nan outstanding debt to the university,\nand the Head of Residential\nAccommodation has stated that they\nwill not seek academic sanctions\nagainst the students.\nThe University College\nLondon Union Accommodation\nRepresentative David Dahlborn\ndescribed the threats as \u201cboth vile\nand cowardly\u201d and claimed that they\n\u201crepresent a mentality at UCL that\nthe bosses would rather expel their\nbest and brightest students than\ntake their complaints and demands\nseriously\u201d.\nUp to 200 students at Campbell\nHouse and 230 at Hawkridge House\nhave been withholding rent money\non the grounds that conditions in\ntheir accommodation buildings are\nsub-par, and that \u2018severely\u2019 disruptive\nbuilding works have been ongoing\nthroughout the exam period.\nThey accuse UCL of violating\nthe Student Accommodation Code\n(SAC) which sets out regulations\nfor all halls of residence. The SAC\nstates that \u201cAll maintenance works\nshould be undertaken so as to\nminimise inconvenience to residents\n\u2026 endeavours should be made to\navoid sensitive periods such as\nexaminations\u201d.\nConstruction work has been taking\nplace at Hawkridge House, located\nin Chalk Farm, since February 2015\ndespite the original plan stating that\nthe disruption would be started in\nSeptember 2014 and finished by this\nJanuary.\nScaffolding has been erected on\nall sides of the building, resulting\nin a lack of natural sunlight inside,\nand dust and drilling noise have\nreportedly left students unable to\nrevise, causing stress and health issues\nfor them.\nWhen the rooms were advertised\nto students last summer there was\nno warning that any building work\nwould be taking place. More than\nhalf of the residents have demanded\na refund of their accommodation\npayments.\nResidents of Campbell House\nin Bloomsbury have also faced\ndisruption as the building next\ndoor is being demolished. Work has\nreportedly been taking place from\n8am, Monday to Saturday for several\nmonths.\nStudents have complained of noisy\ndrilling at over 90 decibels inside\nrooms causing desks and mirrors to\nshake. Shaniqua Hunter, a resident of\nCampbell House, stated \u201cI can\u2019t even\nmake phone calls, watch television,\nstudy, take a nap or listen to music in\nmy own room\u201d.\nA spokesman for UCL reportedly\nsaid that students have been offered\nalternative study space, while\nbedrooms elsewhere have been\nsourced for some others. UCL have\nyet to make an official comment\non the status of the threats and\ncompensation.\nCECILY JOHNSON\nSECTION EDITOR\nResidents protesting outside Campbell House, where many students have\nwithheld rent due to poor living conditions.

The\nsamples analysed included a claw of a\nmeat-eating dinosaur, a few toe bones\nfrom a duck-billed hadrosaur and rib\nfragments with unknown origins.\nUsing electron microscopes, and a\nfocused ion-beam (FIB) to investigate\nthe fossils\u2019 internal structure,\nthey discovered bands that closely\nresemble collagen fibres in modern\nbone samples. This was backed up\nby mass spectrometry, which found\npeaks consistent with fragments of\namino acids present in collagen.\nIn two samples, they also discovered\nstructures that appear very similar to\nred blood cells from birds, and which\nwere again backed up with results\nfrom mass spectrometry, showing a\nstrong chemical similarity to cells\nfrom emus.\nSergio Bertazzo, a Junior Research\nFellow from the Department of\nMaterials and lead author on the\npaper, says he was \u201ctotally blown\naway\u201d by the results.\n\u201cWe were actually hoping so see\nthe gaps left in bone by the organic\nmaterial that had decomposed.\n\u201cThis was absolutely not what\nwe were expecting to find at all. It\nactually took quite a while for us to be\nconvinced of what we saw.\u201d\nEvidence of soft tissues has\npreviously been found in only a\nhandful of extremely high quality\nfossils.\nMost, however, are too poorly\npreserved to show any obvious signs.\nThis is because protein molecules\ndecay quickly\u2014it was previously\nbelieved that their full structure\ncould not be preserved for longer\nthan around 4 million years.\nTherefore, even in the best\npreserved fossils, evidence has only\npreviously been found of protein\nfragments.\nAccording to Bertazzo, however,\nalthough the findings are promising,\nfurther research is needed to confirm\nthem.\n\u201cI think we will need to find more\nof these structures in other fossils,\nand if we are lucky enough to find\nfossils with a larger quantity of the\nstructures, we will be able to isolate\nthem and do even more biochemical\ntests. We will then be sure that they\nare red blood cells.\u201d\nThe paper, published in Nature\nCommunications, involved researchers\nfrom the departments of Materials,\nEarth Science and Bioengineering.\nTheir results and techniques could\nlead to a wealth of new information\nabout dinosaur tissues, as they reveal\nthat far more can be discovered from\nless well-preserved fossils than was\npreviously believed.\nIf confirmed, they could help\nanswer many open questions in\npalaeontology. Investigations\ninto their red blood cells could, for\nexample, identify when dinosaurs\nevolved from being cold blooded to\nwarm blooded.\nAnd there could be fragments of\nother tissues and molecules preserved\nwithin fossils that could give further\nclues about the animals\u2019 biochemical\nmake-up.\n\u201cIf we can confirm that our initial\nobservations are correct, then this\ncould yield fresh insights into how\nNASA\u2019s supersonic \u201cflying saucer\u201d parachute fails\nThe parachute NASA hopes will\nland its future craft on Mars has\nbroken up in a test over the Pacific\nOcean.\nThe current system,which was\nused to land the Curiosity rover\nin 2012,has been used since the\n1970s,and has now reached the\nlimit of the size of payload it can\ncarry.\nThe new decelerator consists\nof a 6 or 8m inflating drag device\nto slow the craft down to around\nmach 2,and a larger 30m main\nparachute,more than twice the\nsize of the previous system.It\u2019s\ndesigned to slow down craft\nweighing up to 3 tonnes,and would\nbe used on any future manned\nmissions.\nLanding fast-moving craft on\nMars is much harder than doing\nso on Earth,because its thin\natmosphere doesn\u2019t provide\nenough resistance for conventional\nparachutes to work effectively.\nBut,unlike on the moon,which\nhas no atmosphere,this thin\natmosphere makes using rockets\nalone unsuitable.\nNASA tested the decelerator in\nthe stratosphere,where the air is\nsimilar to the Martian atmosphere.\nThis is the second failed test of\nthe LDSD,but those involved are\nkeen to show the test was partially\nsuccessful.\n\u201cThe physics involved with\nLDSD is so cutting-edge we learn\nsomething profound every time\nwe test,\u201dsaid Ian Clark,Principal\nInvestigator of the project.\n\u201cGoing into this year\u2019s flight,I\nwanted to see that the parachute\nopened further than it did last\nyear before it began to rupture\nThe limited data set we have at\npresent indicates we may not only\nhave gone well down the road to\nfull inflation,but we may have\nachieved it.\u201d\nJAMES BEZER\nNicknamed the \u201cflying saucer\u201d, the Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator is designed to land craft on Mars\nPhoto: NASA\nthese creatures once lived and\nevolved,\u201d said Bertazzo.\n\u201cWhat we showed here is that this\nkind of preservation is probably\nmuch more common than we\nexpected, so I cannot even begin to\nspeculate about what can be found in\nthe future.\u201d\nDOI:10.1038/ncomms8352\n\n"

What better way to experience its\nwarming, life-giving rays than through the\ndelightfully tinted glass windows of the\nFaculty Building?\nAll-Staff Briefing Cancelled\nThis week\u2019s All-Staff Briefing has sadly been\ncancelled by the Vice Provost (Arbitrary\nExcuses) due to a problem with the air\nconditioning.\nAl assures us that this will be fixed post-haste, but in the meantime he is unable\nto find us a suitably chilled room to hold\nany meetings in. As a result, all in-person\nmeetings have now been cancelled, and\nwill be replaced with conference calls on\nthe messaging service, Skype.\nAll staff members are advised to obtain\nSkype for themselves as soon as\nreasonable possible. Anyone having\ndifficulties is advised to contact the lovely\nboys in IT via their Service Desk. They\nassure us they will be on hand to answer\nany queries as soon as humanly possible\n(1-2 working weeks).\nWhat Is: Conflicts of Interest?\nThis week, our perennially popular \u2018What\nIs\u2019 session will be on the tricky topic of socalled \u2018conflicts of interest\u2019.\nWe received a complaint last week\nregarding the positive opinion of big\noil and gas, claiming that there was an\nunexpressed \u2018conflict of interest\u2019 (their\nwords).\nThe complaint has been dealt with (as\nhas the staff member responsible), but\nit has been decided that in order to aid\ncollaboration between staff members the\nconcept of a \u2018conflict of interest\u2019 should be\nclarified.\nIn a special treat for you all, this session will\nbe lead by the President herself!\nDon\u2019t forget to bring your yoga mat as\nusual, and green tea will (of course) be\nprovided.\nWhat is going on outside the\nBlue Cube this week\nDue to ongoing concerns over student\nnudity and unconfirmed rumours of this\nnudity being photographed, the ban\non leaving the Building without written\npermission remains in place.\nAlice Gast: Thought of the Week\n\u201cI was shocked and disappointed this week\nto hear of students stripping on campus, and\nencouraging their fellows to take pictures\nof them. I was even more shocked and\ndisappointed to discover that these pictures\nwere then being distributed all across campus. I\nhope that all involved will take a long hard look\nat what they\u2019ve done. That Pole and Aerial one\nwas hot stuff though.\u201d\nThe weekly newsletter of the Faculty Building\nBlue News\nProvost Post\nof the Week\nEvery week, a member of\nour esteemed Provost board\nshares their thoughts with\nour collaborative, cohesive\ncommunity. This week, we\nwelcome back Al Pologies,\nVice Provost (Arbitrary\nExcuses)!\nSadly, Al was unable to\nwrite his column this week,\nas he is currently stationed\nat Woodward Hall in Acton,\nhelping to prepare the space\nfor the influx of paying suckers\nstudents in October.\nHowever, this seems like\nan appropriate moment to\nremind you all of the exciting\nnew facilities which have been\nconstructed over in Acton,\nso we\u2019ve asked back Dee\nCreaserent, Vice Provost (Halls\nDemolition) to give us a few\nwords.\nHi everyone!\nIt\u2019s so great to be back on\nthese hallowed pages with\nyet more exciting news about\nour ever-evolving property\nportfolio!\nWe\u2019re delighted to be putting\nthe finishing touches on\nWoodward over the next few\nmonths, as these wonderful\nnew halls present an ideal\nopportunity to introduce\nstudents to the wonders of\nliving and studying out in West\nLondon.\nAs you all know, the cost of\nliving in South Kensington has\nproven to be extremely high\nfor Imperial, as we constantly\nhave to deal with students\ncomplaining about their high\nrent prices and the associated\nfood costs.\nHaving such a large base in\nActon, alongside the wonderful\nImperial West campus, means\nthat the case to relocate all\nstudent activities to Acton and\nthe surrounding area becomes\never stronger.\nImperial has a wonderful\nasset in our South Kensington\ncampus, but I\u2019m sure you can\nall agree with me when I say\nthat students are a blight on\nthe pleasant and wonderful\nenvironment we\u2019ve cultivated\nhere.\nMoving them out to Acton\npresents an ideal solution to all\nof our problems.\nHello all,\nIt\u2019s with a heavy heart that I welcome you back to this, the penultimate\nissue of Blue News for this academic year. Yes, that\u2019s right \u2013 after this,\nthere will be only one more burst of brilliant facts and figures for your\ndigestion until we recommence printing in October.\nI hope this news doesn\u2019t come as too much of a shock for you \u2013 as we all\nknow, all great things must come to an end (before starting again after\na short rest), and that includes Blue News, which we feel confident in\ncalling the greatest thing of all.\nAs the temporary end approaches, now is as good a time as any to start\nlooking back at the year we\u2019ve had \u2013 and what a year it\u2019s been!\nWe\u2019ve had some ups and downs, with the unprecedented success of\nthe likes of our #PeopleatImperial campaign helping to really push a\nprogressive agenda amongst our staff, and the ongoing unveiling of\nWoodward Hall, our brand new accommodation outlet occupying One\nVictoria Road, Acton, taking place to a rapturous reception.\nWe\u2019ve seen off challenges from the likes of the BUAV, Felix and whoever\nit was complaining about oil the other week, showing that Imperial is\nstronger than any other institution who wishes to oppose us.\nWe have an incredibly strong community here at Imperial, and being\nable to fend off the baseless accusations of Felix and their ilk is proof of\nthat. It is to the immense credit of all who live and work in the Faculty\nBuilding that we have emerged through the occasional trial by fire\nunscorched, all through the power of collaboration.\nWe now begin to look ahead, to the future, and to what the next year\nmay bring. There are murmurings among some staff of crowning the next\nyear the \u2018Year of Collaboration\u2019, and we would like to whole-heartedly\nendorse such suggestions. It\u2019s ingenuity like this that helps keep us a\nworld-leading institution.\nHave a productive, cohesive, collaborative and happy day!\n\n"

    "content": "10 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n12.06.2015\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGeorge Butcher takes a look back on his time at Imperial\nThere is always room for improvement\nImperial is full of happy memories, but looking back there are always ways it could be better. Photo: Imperial College\nThis week I finished my degree.\n\u201cCongratulations, you have\ncompleted Mech Eng!\u201d said the\nfigurative game graphic as I answered\nthe last question of my presentation.\nSomehow I managed to do four years\nof my degree without failing an\nexam (hopefully anyway, there\u2019s still\nchance), and probably getting a 2:1\noverall. Thanks for that.\nWould I recommend the Imperial\nexperience? Yes, but that\u2019s not to say\nthat Imperial doesn\u2019t struggle in so\nmany ways.\nWe all laugh at the student\nsatisfaction survey. \u201cPeople don\u2019t\nlike no longer being best,\u201d \u201cImperial\nstudents are just whiny,\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ve\njust got really high standards,\u201d are\nall excuses I\u2019ve heard wheeled out.\nBut the reality is that many students\nare not happy, Oxford, Cambridge,\nUCL and other good universities\nconsistently outperform us. Students\nare not enjoying themselves, and so\nwhy would they rate their university\nhighly?\nThe gender imbalance was the\nbiggest worry for me when I chose\nImperial. It seems silly to say that\nnow: I haven\u2019t struggled to make\nfriends and have kept a wonderful\ngirlfriend, but it does fundamentally\nchange how life works when a large\npart of society is just cut out of your\nlife. I hope that Imperial is trying to\nrectify this \u2013 I know the new \u201cDesign\nEngineering\u201d course has 40% female\napplicants. I want Imperial to commit\nto end this imbalance, for the sake of\nboth accessibility and reducing the\ntestosterone-filled environment that\nwe live in.\nThis leads me onto the second\nproblem with Imperial: mental\nhealth. Two weeks ago Felix published\nthe results of a student-lead Union\nsurvey showing that Imperial not\nonly had a huge number of students\nstruggling with their mental health,\nbut that it was higher than other\nuniversities surveyed by the NUS.\nA few weeks before, we published\nmy own investigation where I\ninterviewed many students who\nhad struggled in some way with\nmental health; the stories behind\nthe statistics. I found that there\nwas support for students and some\ngreat people doing great work. But\nthere is very little strategy, very\nlittle organisation and very little\nrecognition at the most senior levels\nthat the environment here causes\npeople to become ill. This needs\nrecognising, accepting and then\nchanging. The problem is that we\nmake students ill in the first place,\nnot that we struggle to help them\nwhen they are.\nThe way that departments teach\nacross Imperial seems to vary hugely.\nPartly down to the subjects\u2019 nature,\nbut also down to the individuals in\nthat department. As innovative as\nthe research may be, the teaching\nmethods are right out of the\nVictorian era. Most of my time was\nspent in a lecture theatre trying not to\ngo to sleep. If you were lucky you got\na tutorial. If you were very lucky the\ntutor cared enough to teach, most of\nthe time not.\nWhilst my project work in 3rd/4th\nyear has been fantastic, the teaching\nis mediocre at best; my typical state\ncomprehensive school was more\ninnovative in its teaching methods.\nDep Rep meetings seem to be focused\non when computer rooms are open,\nand cafes \u2013 for a university to be\nrelevant in the 21st\ncentury you need\nto radically change how teaching is\ndone, for soon it won\u2019t be possible to\ncruise on a reputation as employers\nrealise that university is just an overly\nelaborate sorting mechanism.\nFinally, Imperial needs to better\nwork with its student union, and the\nUnion with its students. We\u2019re very\nfortunate to have a well organised\nand structured student union. It runs\npopular bars, allows every student to\nuse the clubs and societies that are the\nbackbone of the Imperial social life\nand isn\u2019t going bust.\nBut what is \u201cThe Union\u201d? For\nmany it is this mythical beast that\ninhabits the back offices of level\n2M in Beit. How can the sabbaticals\nhave a personal relationship with\nthe presidents and committee of 350\nclubs? Never mind the entire Dep Rep\nnetwork, an often overlooked part\nof union work. Too often we don\u2019t\nfeel part of our own student union:\nthis very paper, which is a society\nof the Union, paid for by the Union\nwith an editor elected along with the\nsabbatical team in Union elections,\nhas a separate \u201cUnion Page\u201d, which is\nbizarre. This came to a head when the\nrugby team actively worked against\nthe Union\u2019s efforts to minimise the\nCollege or police sanctions into public\naccusations by The Telegraph, rather\nthan seeing them as a method of\nsupport and help.\nYou might read this and think that\nI haven\u2019t enjoyed Imperial. This is not\ntrue, I have done. However an article\nabout how wonderful Imperial is and\nwhat a great place it is to discover new\nstuff doesn\u2019t make as a good a read.\nImperial College is genuinely full\nof opportunities and I\u2019ve had a great\ntime taking advantage of as many as\nI can, but there is always room for\nimprovement. Go on Imperial, you\ncan do it.\n\n"
