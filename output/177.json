    "content": "- 2 FELIX\nIIWIA to th t Sdltc\nDear Sir,\nThere are many rumours circulating, in the\nUnion concerning the position of the bar in\n\\the light of the new licencing laws. I feel\nthat there are some of next years' officials\nand students who would like to be enlightened on some of the following points:\u2014\n1. What will be the future closing time and\ncan the duty officer extend this?\n2. Are extensions available in the x ear and\nif so are they more limited in number and\nlaws than this year?\n3. Are extensions dependent on the closing time of the bar?\nPerhaps someone could answer these?\nYours,\nIK. MARSHALL\nANSWERS.\n1. 10.30 p.m. The duty officer and bar attendants can at their discretion extend this\ntill the legal closing time of 11.00 pj n.2. Extensions will not be effected by the\nnew lease.\n3. No. This information comes from reliable sources.\nGarden Hall\nLook 'ere Mister,\nWhat's this we read in Felix about that Carnival Barb-q then, with 'dismal dancing under the Marquis' and some 'pe pole' in Weeks\nHall bar?\nWe and our merry men haven't seen no\n'pe pole' despite many a nights boozing in\nthis 'os tel ry. As for the large and unwanted\nearl, if We catch 'air or 'ide of 'an again on\nOur Estates, Wei\nwill fill 'im in.\nWe know our rights.\nLORD GARDEN LAMLEY9\nS TECHNICAL& GENERAL BOOKS ART MATERIALS DRAWING INSTRUMENTS STATIONERY PAPERBACKS1.3&5 EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.7. Dear Sir,\nI was very interested to read of the dis\ncontent about the Union Refectory by Dave\nWilbraham and your sympathetic comments.\nHaving been at I.C. for just a few months\nas aP.G. from Birmingham, I would like\nto mention that I was appalled at the differences in the standard of the food and service\nbetween the two Unions. The food at Brum\nUnion was much better, of more choice,\nslightly cheaper and more quickly served, and\nthe atmosphere of the staff very good\u2014there\nbeing none of the re sen 'ful bitterness which\nI notice here. All this is despite the same\novercrowding and overworked canteen staff.\nThe interesting point I wish to be raised is\nthat food was served in exactly the same way\nthat Mr. Wilbraham suggests-From what I have found out about\nMooney, it appears that it is much better\nthan it used to be, but this doesn't seem to\nmean very much if there is still cause for dis-content, which I think there is.\nApart from the way food is served, I should have thought these could be of more\nchoice in the main dishes, vegetables, cheese\nrolls (e.g. brown). I 've noticed that often the\nmain rush is over by about 1.30, at least in\nthe upper refectory, and this is when the\n\u2022food often reaches it's worst. Perhaps the\nHalls could be closed earlier thus eliminating this standing around of staff which is\ncostly, and also tiring for them. If it became\nestablished that they closed (top at 1.15 and\nbottom at 1.45) then students would get used\nto it and it may work well.\nNutritionally speaking (I'm a biochemist)\nI feel that it may be a real possibility that\nunless a student obtains extra food such as\nfruit and fresh ve g., then over a long period\nof time, he risks landing himself in a very\nsub-heath ful condition. Since the question of\nnutritional value was raised a few comments\nmay be of some use here. It seems that from\nthe point of view of bulk carbohydrate, pro-te in, and fat, then we get all we need and\nperhaps more. But from the point of view of\nvitamins, salts and trace elements, the food\nmay be harmfully lacking. (However, modern food theory says that it isn't what you\neat but the form in which it is taken.).\nAnother point I would like to raise concerns the meat bought. It strikes me that\nthere must be several grades of 'say, stewing,\nand I.C. must take the lowest. The quantity\nof the stewing meat seems to be particularly\nbad.\nFinally, its a fact that vast numbers of\nus grumble, but as usual do nothing. However, we have concrete proposals which could\nbe implemented at fairly low cost (Mr.\nMooney seems to be liberal enough financially on the important occasions\u2014Hall dinners\nfor example, though I don't really know\nwhether this h sub sidi sed). Anyway if there\nis a genuine money shortage some method\nshould be found of making more available.\nYours faithfully,\nP.J.

Cardiff easily beat I.C. into\n2nd position the effects of the previous even-ing's May Ball taking its toll on the home\nteam. Olympic bronze medalist, Peter Radford\n(O won both sprints in 9.7 sees, and 21.4 sees,\nrespectively. The highlight of the match was\nthe 440 yards in which J. Wood (I.C.) set a new College record of 49.1 sees, and P. Clifton (I.C.) finished 3rd with a personal best\ntime of 50.5 sees. I.C. provided 4 other\nwinners\u2014a credible performance in the\nface of strong opposition, these were:\n880 yards \u2014 P. Clifton, 1 min. 58.0 sees.\n1 mile \u2014 E.C.

The Hospital's team was a very fine one and it was certainly no disgrace to be 2nd to such a team which\ncontained 3 international representatives.\nJohn Cleator set a new Championship record with his winning time for the 3,000\nmetres steeple-chase of 9 mins. 6.6 sees.\u2014a time which has only been once this year in\nthe country.

    "content": "Imperial College is particularly fortunate\nin the international diversity of its student\npopulation. Seventy countries are represented\namong our 600 or so overseas students, the\nvast majority of this kaleidoscope of races,\ncolours and creeds being post-graduates. However, anyone who thinks that we have been\ntaking advantage of this particular feature\nof College life is sadly mistaken. Year after\nyear it is realised that of all the groups in\nCollege the overseas students are the least\ninter grated into the corporate life of the Union. If this article serves its purpose it will\nshow some of the ways we can improve our\ndomestic international relationships. Encouraging progress has already been made, Mr. Mac's \"Wind of change\" has recently been\nheard whistling round the Union.\nFather Ivor has explained many of the\nreasons why our overseas students do not\nfeel particularly welcome at College. The\ncauses of considerable insularity among both\nBritish and overseas students are the follow-ing:\n(i) Most of our foreigners are mature and\nserious-minded post-graduates, largely uninterested in the wilder aspects of undergraduate\nlife. Also most of them have no social contact at all with un de graduates \u2014even in then\nown departments.\n(ii) Many overseas students are over here\nonly for a year or so on DIC courses\u2014not\nlong enough to become fully integrated. fl How long does it take to make friends?).\n(iii) British students tend to stick around\nwith their immediate group of friends and\nhesitate (apathy, or that celebrated British\n\"reserve\"?) to make an approach to the obviously lonely blok e from overseas, out' of\nthe swing of British University life.\n(iv) Bewildered by lack of social contact,\nthe shattering insults of racial bigot rv when\nhunting for digs, and difficulties usually with\ntheir studies, or with the language perhaps,\nsome of the overseas students become desperately lonely, withdrawing completely from\nCollege life, or restricting their circle of\nfriends to a small group of fellow \"outsiders\"\nfrom back home.\nYou may feel an understandable hesitation\nin making a friendly approach to a particular Englishman /Foreigner. He may be an\nunpleasant slob, inebriated, depraved, after\nyour girl friend, thick to the verge of idiocy,\na deadly patron sing bore, a brown-b agger or\neven a Guildsman. But by and large the\nchances are that you will be able to find\nstronger arguments for mutual friendship and\nunderstanding than you will for setting on\neach another with knuckle dusters and flick\nknives, or hiding behind silly little walls of\ninsularity.\nVery successful attempts to provide social\ncontacts for students visiting this country are\nmade by the British Council, UL U Goats\nClub, the National Students Union in London, the International Friendship League, the\nKensington Committee for Friendship, and\nso on. Although all of these organisations\nprovide invaluable services there are a few which are so patronising I was tempted\nto add Our Dumb Friends League to the\nabove list\nWithin College a fine social programme for\noverseas student visitors has been organised\nduring the past two summers by Brian Manton and Brian Bond but this did not affect\nour own overseas students very much.\nAfter a short lived attempt by the SSC last\nyear to promote social contact by \"con-to ct ers\" inviting a few of the lonelier overseas students into their rooms for coffee, the\nInternational Relations Club, with the backing and active support of national and religious societies at IC, tried a new venture by\norganising a series of \"International Evenings\" during this academic year. These even-in gs, usually held over coffee and sandwiches\nin Weeks Hall Lounge, sought to provide interesting topics for discussion in an informal\natmosphere, and a regular audience of between 30 and 70 is not bad by an v standards.\nThe programme included discussions led by\nProfessor Blackett, and Sir Willis Jackson,\non \"Technology and the Emerging Countries\", evenings of Indian classical music and\nEnglish folk songs, \"Islam and Christianity\"\nand \"Contemporv Poland\". There were also\nvisits to \"Tiger at the Gates\", and the Houses\nof Parliament. (ind an International Party\norganised by the Church Society. If you add\nto this a very fine year of activities for the\nChinese. Indian and Pakistan Societies, and\nthe magnificence of the International Evening during Carnival Week vo u will see what\nI mean by the \"Wind of Change\". The overseas students are beginning to find their place\nin College and to make a really impressive\ncontribution to the corporate life of the Union.\nWhilst it is important to continue our present spate of international activity, there are\na number of ways in which the effectiveness\nof our work next year may be greatly in-creased.\n(i) Every effort should be made to welcome the fresher overseas students from the\nmoment of their first arrival at College\u2014possibly a special evening could be arranged for\nthis purpose at the very beginning of the\nautumn term.\n(ii) Early on in the term great attempts\nshould be made.\n(a) By the national societies to recruit\nmembers from outside their immediate national groups;\n(b) By clubs in the SSC, ACC and RC C to recruit overseas students and help\nthem to join in the corporate life of\nCollege.\n(iii) An international activity in which as\nwide a selection of the College's international\ncommunity as possible participates should be\norganised later on in the autumn term. Possibly a mock United Nations assembly on the\nlines Si Lyle has previously indicated on\nthis journal could be held on United Nations Day .\n(iv) As soon as possible an effective body\nshould be established to co-ordinate the\nInternational Relations Club, the National\nSocieties and the official College machinery\nfor helping overseas students.\n(v) Parties of IC students should be organised to help the British Council in their\n\"Operation Landlady\" for lodgings for our\ncoloured students who have not a place in\nHall, and so avoid the humiliating insults that\nso many have had to face up till now.\nMOSCOW MURAL FOR3 rd YEAR PHYSICS\nThe third year physic students have been\ngiven a well travelled mural for their common room in the Physics Block. The 20 feet\nlong mural was originally designed by Abram\nGames R.A. for AEI's stand at the British\nIndustries Fair in Moscow and depicts 30\nelectrical products of the company. Besides\nbeing used at Moscow the mural was also\ncopied by the Central Office of Information\nfor use at the Nigerian International Trade\nFair at Lagos 27th October-18th November.\nHow did the third year physics students\nget the Mural? The third year noticed a colour illustration of it on the cover of AE1\"\u00bb\n1960 Careers for Graduates and wrote to\nthem asking whether a copy could be obtained for their common room. The letter arrived just about the time the Central Offico\nof Information decided that it wanted a cop>\ninstead of the original for Lagos so AEI offered the original to the third year physics\n\u2014with the proviso that it can have the Mural back if it should want it for an exhibition\nin th future.\nThere will be no formal presentation because of the exams.\n\n"

In that article the quality of the\nmeals in the lower refectory was discussed\nand a solution for their inconsistent quality\nwas suggested To say that the meals in the\nlower refectory do not leave something to\nbe desired would be hypocritical, but a few\nwords on the present conditions are in or-der.\nAll of the refectories and snack bars in the\nCollege are administered by the refectory\ncommittee which consists of staff and stud-ents. Mr. Mooney, as refectory manager, is\nresponsible for his staff and the day to day\noperation of the refectories. To say that Mr. Mooney and his staff can' only produce poor\nquality food, or lack any imagination of how\nto improve the present facilities is indeed un-fair. One needs only attend a club dinner.\nHall Dinner, or a special function to realise\nthat the kitchen staff can prepare excellent\nquality food, and at a very competitive price.\nThe chief difficulty with the meals served\nat lunch or supper in the lower refectory is\nthat the kitchens in the Union are now coping with 50% more meals than the number\nfor which they were designed. This increased\ndemand has been met as much as possible\nby changes in the kitchen equipment, how-ever, the ser very in the lower refectory has\nalways been the outstanding difficulty which\nhas seemed to defy solving. Sometime ago\nMr. Mooney had hoped to completely modify the present counter arrangement, but\nit was learned that the middle pillar is a supporting column which cannot be removed.\nIt thus remains for us to hope that with\nthe opening of the refectories in the South\nSide the demand on the Union kitchens will\nbe reduced.\nThe Editor wishes to thank Andrew Pavlowicz for his unbounded enthusiasm in working for Felix; to Mike Combes for getting so\nmany advertisements and risking double\npneumonia for the sake of a Felix poster (this\nis the second person Felix thanks for risking\npneumonia; the first actually caught it but\nshe has recovered now); to Chris Bagnall for\norganising an excellent sales staff of Year\nReps, and attractive ICWArians; to Roger\nHenson for sacrificing a lot of his time taking excellent photographs; to Rob Cheeney\nand Dave Gilbert,, who not only placed their\nwealth of editorial experience at my disposal\nbut also helped type copy and do layouts; to\nthe staff of Wing Cmdr. Garby-Czerniawski,\nof i he West London Offset Co.; and to all.\nthose who wrote for Felix, Robin Salmon in\nparticular, and those who helped to sell Felix.\nThe poster series was initiated and executed\nby Mike Combes, Chris Bagnall, and Roger\nHenson. It will continue next year. I think\nthey deserve special thanks for this. As a result Felix has doubled circulation and\nbroken even financially this term. Quite\nfrankly, all .of us (even Cat Call) are very\nproud of this.\nThe remainder of the articles covered\nmany other topics, and one that I should\nlike to pass further comments on is that of\ncolours and awards. This topic is of particular\ninterest as it will undoubtedly come up at\nthe next council meeting.\nThe chairman of the S. C.C. in his article\nhas suggested that awards should be available for those who are not eligible for social\ncolours. The chairman of the R.C. C. in his\narticle has suggested that the social colours\nshould be put on the same level as the athletic colours by establishing I.C. colours, which\nwould be presented rather than the present\nathletic and social colours. Both of these\ngent e men go on to explain why their\nschemes would be opposed, but I do think\nthen proposals merit further consideration.\nA rational solution would be to establish\nI.C. colours for all competitive activities and\nawards for individuals who have contributed\nto the Union but who are not eligible for\ncolours. The I.C. colours would then be\ngiven in place of the present,athletic colours\nand social colours. The' admins t ration of these colours could be handled by the present athletic and social colours committees. The\nathletic clubs who feel that this would reduce the standard of the colours need only\ncompare their activities with, for example,\nthe national reputation of the bridge ano\ngliding clubs to see that the standard would\nnot be. jeo pardi sed The awards would then have two categories; Club Awards, and Union General Awards, both to be administered the same as\nthe present Union General Award. This system has the advantage that Union members\nwho do contribute outstandingly in any Union activity can have his or her work recognised even if it is not within the scope of the\npresent Union General Award. /\nIf the above scheme was established then\nit would be possible for any Union member\nregardless of his main interest to be eli bible for some of recognition.\nScrutiny by DAVE GILBERT\n\"Surely the idea that Scrutiny is a magazine run by the stirrers and troublemakers is\na little out of date . . . I supposed that we\nhad seen the last of statements of this kind\nbut, alas I did not count on Mr. Gilbert.\"\nThus Mr. Donald Pearson in the last Felix\nof last term. Alas, not only did the then\nEditor of Scrutiny omit to count on me, he\ndid not count on his successor either., Mr. Wusteman, who in the last is ue of Scrutiny\nbrings the a for mentioned idea right up to\ndate. In a previous review of Scrutiny I suggested that perhaps a searing lyc rtica l article on Felix might be a good thing (Scrutiny\nbeing a searing ly critical magazine) and I was\nquite looking forward to this term's issue. However, the staff were not quite up to this effort\nand contented themselves with what they call\nconstructively critical comments.\nLet me quote a few. \"In what must surely\nbe a self-parody the Rugby Club's item is entitled 'Booze-Ups in Belgium.\" Well, thank\nyou, but so what? The Rugby Club went to\nBelgium over Easter: half the time they spent\nin boozing and the other half they spent in\nsoundly thrashing all their opponents in excellent fashion, but of course, your delicate\nsensibilities prevented you from mentioning\nthis last\n\"Rowdy Union meetings are described for\nonce without mention of a de bagging.\" Felix\nis a newspaper: de bagging s interest and amuse some of its readers: when they occur\nthey are reported, when they don't they aren't. This seems entirely reasonable.\nMr. Wusteman, who was responsible for\nthe above extracts, also makes some prudish noises about the picture of the Carnival\nQueen when appeared in a recent issue of Felix. He says, \" . . . one must assume that he\nwas. badly short of copy when trying to fill\nthe Carnival pages.\" Your perspicacity is am-azin g,Mr. Wusteman. Felix appears once <x fortnight, not once a term, and the first issue\nof term is always hard to fill; a photo gr ph of young lady partly naked seems an admirable way of taking up the odd page which\nwould otherwise be emp tv. And surely even\nthe Editor of Scrutiny finds the sight of Miss\nPetri's naked back just a little pleasurable?\nOf course the only valid criticism to be made\nis that it was a pity that the photographer\nhad insufficient powers of composition and\npersuasion to obtain a more aesthetically\nsatisfactory picture, but valid criticism does\nnot seem to be Mr. Wusteman's strong point.\nHowever, by an elegant series of mental\ngymnastics, he does manages to conclude\nthat because I take in account the alignment\nof the writer when assessing the vitality of his\nargument, \"Felix does indeed ex i bit a conscious bias.\" Eeven without the non sequitur s,I relinquished the job of Editor in January,\nand any virtues or defects since are nothing\nto do with me. But thanks for the publicity.\nIn short. Mr. Wusteman has looked at Felix and far from making any useful or relevant comments, he has sneered at it, taking\nhalf page to do so. Is this what Scrutiny\nwas founded for? Has Scrutiny really nothing\nbetter to do than sneer?\nSi Scams part of the scene\n\n"

HAS A UNION\nMEETING!!\nDEMOCRACY TRIUMPHS\u2014JUST ABOUT by TONY MUSGRAVE The date Tuesday, May 29th,1962. The\nplace the Union Concert Hall. The time 1.20\np.m. Seaforth Lyle, here in after to be denoted as Si rises, admits the meeting's in qu or a city, but with a fine transatlantic desire to\nget to business brushes aside our English\nworship of the rule book and declares the\nmeeting open.\nMartin Stacey begins a recital of the minutes of the last Union meeting held on Nov.\n6th,1961. Words and events which now have\na faded period charm.\nThe minutes close. Any errors or omissions? The cry goes up \"Where's Herbert?\"\nMr. John White, one of the Union mascot\nbearers explained that he was too short and\nthat anyway it was Trevor Porridge's turn.\nMr. White then congratulated Mr. Stacey\nfor making the minutes of the Nov. meeting\nlast longer than that meeting itself, a poetic\nrather than a factual remark but one much\nappreciated.\nNow business. The elections we had all\ncome to vote on, so that we the people could\ndecide on our representatives on the College\nConucil next year. But no there were no Council elections, all 6 candidates were elected\nunopposed, an unheard of state of affairs.\nIt is 1.30 p.m. and Si has come up against\nthe hard fact that there has to be an actual\nelection for the Entertainment Committee 5\nfrom 6 to be chosen and an in quo rate Union\nmeeting under the Union rules couldn't elect\na rice pudding. So Si states that Council\nwill elect the Entertainment Committee. Uproar. Various Jesuitical arguments float around but in the end Mr. Richard Lewis carries the day by stating that it was more valid\nfor the 320 or so in the Concert Hall to vote\nthan for the 20 on Council. This was met\nwith shouts of \"A load of bloody rubbish\"\nfrom one of the Union Court Jesters, and\naccordingly it was decided to proceed with\nthe vote. The six candidates were lined up\nat the front of the Concert Hall as if before\na firing squad and the vote taken by ballot.\nWhile the count was being made the reports\nfrom the Clubs Committee were given.\nGed Brough, Chairman of AC.C, reported an , extremely successful sporting\nyear with trophies galore. He said that\nthe Sports Centre to be sited at 1-7 Prince's Gardens was not likely to be in use for another two to three years, but the extensions\nat Harrington\u2014new changing rooms\u2014would\nbe completed by next January.\nThe results of the Entertainments Committee elections were then announced, and\nit was noted that there were 396 votes cast.\nSo we wu z legal after all and business and\nconstitution could now walk hand in hand.\nThose elected were: Ray Jones, Dick Foster,\nDave Loftus, Hilary Lear, P.R. Mooring.\nThe following reports were then given.\nStu Gardiner, RCC\u2014successes by the Dram.\nSoc., Bridge and Jazz clubs, and a report\nthat the Cambridge Scout and Guide club\nhad enjoyed \u2022 Mooney's food.\nBrian Bond, SCC\u2014a good year for the\nContacters club and the International Relation club. An inter-religious societies football league was to be started up.\nThe president's report. Felix. Since\nthere was no guarantee of firms advertising\nregularly, the only way to stop present losses\u2014\u00a3250 subsidy this year\u2014was to cut printing costs and this has been initiated by the\npurchase of printing equipment for the Un ion which will halve the costs of printing\nFelix. The last issue this year will appear\nusing the new process. The rector had approved the idea of a mechanical workshop\nwhere the mobile mascots could be housed\nand students could service their vehicles. Tt\nremained to find a suitable site. As for South\nSide, the Executive Committee had persuaded\nthe College that the two floors of general\nstudent area in that building should be considered as another student's Union to be run\nby the students. This would provide 50%\nmore Union facilities. At this there Was\nloud applause. Dr. Cameron's proposals\nto decent ril ize I.C. Union and build Hall\nspirit were then discussed. Si said that\nDr. Cameron had made his proposals\ni for| the past three years and would\nmake them again next year. Jon Bareford\nthen reported on the Carnival which had been\na great success except for the weather which\nat the Fete on the Saturday had caused the\ntakings to drop from \u00a3500 to \u00a3200. The\noverall profit made was in the region of \u00a31,100\nas opposed to \u00a3945.17.9 last year.\nWe then moved on to Motions. Brian Bond\nproposed that the Quorum should be reduced to 300 which was passed with little ar-gu ment, with the ne cesar y\\ majority.\nMartin Stacey then carefully explained to\nus how hard our President worked and that\na Deputy President was needed. There were\nmuttering s and Finlay McPherson clarified\nthe situation by suggesting that the two issues involved in Stacey's proposal\u2014the establishment of the post of Deputy President\nand the method of his election\u2014should be\nconsidered separately. The first of these was\nthen put to the vote and carried. But the\nmethod of election of the said officer caused\nmuch discussion. Stacey wanted him nominated and elected by Council as is the present Secretary, which in effect means chose r. by the President. McPherson suggested\nelection by the Union. Lawrie Austin then\nsaid it would be better if the Secretary was\nelected by the Union and the Deputy President by joint Council. This motion was ac-c ep ted, discussed, voted on and defeated by\n65\u2014200 votes. Hence the Deputy President\nwill be elected by joint Council.\nBoth these motions, Mr. Bond's and Mr.\nStacey's need to be ratified by a regular Union meeting.\nUnder A OB it was announced that the\nDuke of Edinburgh was going to open the\nnew City and Guilds building on July 12th and volunteers for stewards on that day\nplease see Brian Bond.\nLastly Mr. Roger Thomas proposed that\nCouncil should disband two or more important societies per session so as to ensure a quorum at Union meetings to protest about\nthis. Si said this had already been contemplated and with that the meeting closed at\n2.35 p.m. The various votes of thanks that were made\nhave not been reported but they expressed\nthe gratitude of the Union to the student\nOfficers who have given up a great deal of\ntheir free time to run the Union extremely\nwell this year.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 3\nState of the Union\nThe societies which form the Imperial College Union Social Clubs Committee are sometimes jocular y referred to as the \"talking soc-ie ties\". This description does contain a great\ndeal of truth, for the basic ingredient of the\nsocial clubs jis talking. They discus lsm osi subjects that intelligent students would want\nto discuss, namely\u2014religion, politics, philosophy and international matters. These sub-j ect s, whether taken in the context of social\nclubs or not, are an essential part of one's university education and the social clubs provide a platform for such discussion.\nIt is essential, therefore for any Collegw\nUnion not only to have successful social clubs\nbut to give them the opportunity to expand\nThis is where the poor relation aspect comes\nin. In the past there have been attempts to\nminimise the influence of the social clubs.\nNot so very long ago there were no such\nsocieties as the Conservative Society and the\nSocialist Society but all political activity was\nlumped together into a wie rd concoction\ncalled the Political Society. As recently as two\nyears ago an attempt was made to join all\nthe national societies into an International\nSociety. As regards the religious societies,\nit is only in the last few years that any denominational society has been formed. Fin.\nally, there was that piece of intolerance at\nthe end of last session. The difficulties of\nthe social clubs in the past therefore has been\ntwofold. On one hand there has been some\ndegree of intolerance and on the other there\nhave been these attempts at amalgamation\nwhich could only serve to restrict the activities of the clubs concerned.\nAt the present time the Social Clubs Committee is being much less hampered in its\nactivities and as a consequence has less reason for the so-called left-wing attitude for\nwhich it was once so notorious. So, I am\nled to think that my idea of the poor relation making good is a fair picture, though\nthis is said in fear and trepidation for, as in\npolitics, so if is in S. C.C. affairs, and the\n'never-had-it-so-good' phase cannot last for\never. For the time being, however, all is\nwell, after all Scrutiny is respectable with\nvery satisfying sales (and content!) a successful year has been had by most societies, the\nAfrica Society has gained a new lease of life\nand a new society, the Theosophical Society\nhas been formed.\nHowever, good as they are, things could\nbe better. The relation may be making good\nbut it is definitely still poor and also un re warded for its efforts. By this of course, I mean\nthat the budget is still very tight and that\na person who does good work for his social\nclub has no chance of official recognition\nother than the extremely remote possibility\nof a Union General Award.\nOn the financial aspect, of course, I realise that money is tight in the Union and\nthat it is likely to remain so in the future\nand I also see only too well the fallacy in\nthe argument of comparing the assistance\ngiven to the S. C.C. with that given to say, the\nGliding dub, but what the S. C.C. needs at\nthe present is expansion and this means some\ndegree of .elbow-room financially. Granfted\nthis it should be possible for the Union to\nhave the benefit of more attractive and interesting meetings by the social clubs as the\ncommittees of the clubs could be somewhat\nTHE POOR RELATION MAKES GOOD by B.D. BOND\nmore ambitious in their choice of speakers,\netc.\nAs regards colours, the present ruling is\nthat only those societies that take part in\ncompeting activities are eligible for colours\nand this means, for the S. C.C. that only the\nDebating Society qualifies. There is the Union General Award which in theory can be\nawarded to any number of people and therefore people active in the social clubs qualify\nfor such an award. However, in the past,\nand quite rightly, the number of such awards\nhas been limited to seven or eight each year.\nSuch a limitation serves to preserve the honour and the stature of the award.\nBut this leaves the S. C.C out in the cold\nand it has been suggested, th re fore that a Social Club's Award be instituted and awarded\nto those people whose work among the social clubs justified such an award. This &\nward would naturally also be open to those\nclubs in the R.C. C. which are not covered\nby the present system for social Colours. This\naward would in no way conflict with the Union General Award but would be complementary to it just as chips are to steak.\nIf these two weaknesses, finance and awards\nwere rectified then I can see a very bright\nfuture ahead for the social clubs in Imperial\nCollege.\nWHAT AWARDS?\nRELIEF FROM TEDIUM S.P. GARDINER\nThe clubs in I.C. Union are split into three\ngroups i \u2014Athletics, .Recreational and Social\nClubs Committees. Three years ago the\nR.C. C did not exist and all the clubs under\nits control were part of the S. C.C. There,\nwere *hus forty clubs in S. C.C. and the committee was consequently completely unman-age able. To ease administration the S. C.C. was devi ded roughly in half. The new\nS. C.C. contained religious, political and national societies together with a few others\nwhose man activity was ex cerise of the jaw.\nThe remainder\u2014bridge, mountaineering dra-mati c, music, wine tasting, etc.,\u2014were put\ninto a new group which described their act-iv it y, the Recreational Clubs Commeette,\nThe formation of the Recreational Clubs\nCommittee served to relieve its members of\nthe tedium of the S. C.C. wranglers. Constitutions of clubs under its control were ah\noli shed, and the clubs were subject only to\nthe R.C. C. constitution and I.C. Union rules.\nSuch has been the system for two years, and\nit has run very smoothly, but it is for see able that under the influence of one constitution-monger as chairman, all this could change.\nR.C. C. would again be shackled by standing\norders instead of guided by recommend at ions, and the chairman's task would be more\ndifficult. The position.of Chairman involves\nless work than the presidency of an active\nclub, but is of course a far more responsible\nposition, both in matters of finance and Union politics.\nIt is unfortunate that, because of an antiquated system of 'colour' awards, th rifle'\nand sailing clubs remain in A.C.C. instead of\ntaking\" their logical place in R.C. C. The\nclub themselves are not to blame, it is the\nsystem which is at fault. The clubs resist any\nchange which would deprive them of athletic\ncolours and make them qualify for social\ncolours, an award held in lower esteem. Athletic colours are available only to clubs in\nA.C.C., while R.C. C and S. C.C, award soc-cia l colours for competitive representative\nactivities. If this inconsistency is to be rfa\nmoved from an otherwise reasonably logical\nsystem, action can take three different cour-ses.\nThe offending clubs could be removed to the R.C. C., presumably against\ntheir will, such that they would then only\nqualify for social colours. They thus come\ninto line with the gliding club whose only\nrecognition for national representation is the\nsocial colour. This scheme has the merits\nof being the simplest to put into operation\nbut will of course offend the clubs in quest-ion.\nTo avoid resentment, some adjustment\nshould be made in the sv stem of colour a wards. Thus the A.CC. colour would have\nto be extended to selected cl\"bs in R.C CAn extension of the colours committee would\nbe required so as to include the R.C C. chair-man. A workable scheme is produced with\nsome symmetry; the R.C. C. clubs could qualify for either athletic or social colours, depending on the nature of their activity.\nAn alternative scheme for modifying the\ncolour award system is to abolish the social\nand athletic colours as such, and have only\none award for competitive representative activity called the I.C. colour. This is by fai\nthe most obvious and logical scheme, but it\nwill meet with blind, un reasoned opposition\nfrom the A.C.C., who believe that they would\nbe lowering their standards. This supercilious superiority of the A.C.C. is completely\nillogical as a perfunctory examination of club\nrecords will show.\nThe whole question of colours has been\ndiscussed before, but the reiteration of these\nideas may bring some new ones to light.\n\n"

The luggage was transported to the other side of the roof and a rope lowered about fifty feet onto the level\nof the Senior Common Room.\nThe first mountaineer descended, and the\none who thought of it was half lowered, to\nthe accompaniment of whispered swearword and anglo-saxon descriptive nouns.\nThen followed the luggage. The other pullers descended in approximately the same way\nfollowed by the second mountaineer.\nAt this point we discovered the rope was\nstuck. The easiest way to release it was to\nclimb through a conveniently open window into the S. C.R., unlock the door, go up the\nstairs, out of the window, throw the rope\ndown and return the same way. This was\ndone.\nThe time\u20141.00 hrs. Thursday morning.\nFinal preparations were completed. The\nSpanner-hanger (the first mountaineer) climbed\ninto the sling and was lowered over the edge\nof the building with an extra rope in the Apsaal position. The three pullers were grimly\nhanging onto the rope and were stuck there\nfor the next hour.\nThe spanner, brush, and bucket of paste\nwere lowered and the operation of pasting\nbegan. After about twenty minutes of, \"Down\nsix inches\" (Grunts), \"Down a bit more\"\n(Grunts), \"Up a bit\" (Those anglo-saxon\nnouns again), one of the security officers decided to look round the S. C.R., turned on\nthe lights and checked the windows.\nWe was worried.\nThe paper hanging was eventually finished\nand the mountaineer descended to the\nground. The rest of the party a psa a led down the. 90 ft. wall, the luggage having been\nlowered first. The watch-dog announced that\nnothing had happened on his level so we\ncleared up and left at about 3.15 hrs., the\njob having taken about four hours, and the\nmountaineer had been hanging for about an\nhour.\nSigned,\n\"The one who thought of the idea\"\nLOOKING BACK It is not inappropriate to recall how Spanner was captured and repainted in R.C.S. colours towards the end of the Guilds Freshers Dinners last Xmas.\nIt has been observed that the Guilds Mascot Bearers always took the same route from\nthe bar after each Fresher's Dinner. This\ngave the R.C.S. Vice-President an idea. After one of these Dinners, as the Spanner\nminder s turned the corner half-way up the\nstairs besides the snack bar, they saw waiting for them a hand-picked bunch of Geologists, Chemists, and Mathematicians who\nswept down on them. Turning and retracing\ntheir steps the Guildsmen saw the other half\nof a neat pincer movement, composed of\nPhysicists, Zoologists and Botanists, w no swarmed up to meet them. Spanner was cap-tu red, and pushed through the Snack Bar\nwindow into a waiting car. An interesting\npoint about the actual painting of the R.C.S. colours was that the paint was mixed in the\nbulb of an old experimental model of Theta\nwhich was in fact the float from the ball-cock of a Guilds lavatory. The Spanner was\nburied in the tow-path at Putney, and Guilds\nregained the Spanner on Morphy Day.\nIT TOOK PROFESSIONAL MEN TWO DAYS TO REMOVE THE SPANNER STOP PRESS CATCALL has been fired.

    "content": "FELIX\nPRESIDENT ELECT LID DLE GUILDS UNION AGM by D. GILBERT\nThe last Guilds Union Meeting of this\nterm was attended by 240 members, in spite\nof the fact that the first year exams started\nthe next day. The main item of business was\nthe election of next year's Executive, and\nthe results were: \u2014\nPresident \u2014 Chris Liddle\nSecretary \u2014 John KlaSchka\nVice-President \u2014 John White\nHon. Jun. Treasurer \u2014 John Skinner\nCouncil Rep. S.P. Gardiner\nO.C. Rep. \u2014 Lawrie Austin\nThe last two posts were unopposed. The\nother election was of course for the Norris\nMuck-Stirring Trophy, and the two candid\nat es nominated before the meeting, Ged\nBrough and Denis Harburn, were surprisingly defeated by a last-minute entry, the President, Lawrie Austin. The result was received with acclamation from the floor and\nblushes from the President.\nIn his report Lawrie mentioned the sporting triumphs, far too numerous to detail here,\nwhich Guilds had achieved in the. past year,\nand thanked the Executive and the Union\nfor all their work to make it a really vintage\nyear for the College. He stressed the difficulties which the move into the new buildings\nwould bring for the Union, and asked all\nmembers to pull their weight next year. Firsi\nyears were asked to try very hard to pass\ntheir exams so that there would not be a shortage of hosts at the next year's fresher si dinners.\nAt the conclusion of his report the President received an unprecedented ovation\nlasting several minutes, a fitting tribute for\nall his efforts for the Guilds Union, and the\nvote of thanks, proposed by the new President, was carried with acclamation and prolonged cheering. The Union certainly appreciated their President.\nAfter the concluding Boomalacka, the\nField Cup Race was announced. This was\nmarred by an incredible coincidence; at\nleast a dozen policemen were hanging round\nthe Serpentine Bridge, and this held up the\nrace for a long time. Two oil drums had to\nbe brought back to the Guilds Building and'\none had to be carried through the Serpentine,\nitself; the coppers did not appear to look\nfavourably upon this, and called out a motorboat to ensure that a dastardly crime was\nnot committed, i.e., that a student should\nswim across the Serpentine. Eventually the\ndrums were taken to the far ends of the lake\nand across that way, and Chem. Eng. and\nCivils arrived at the finishing post simultaneously. A sort of wall-game developed, and;\nafter a great deal of argument about who\ncheated and how, the two departments shared\nthe Cup and the beer.\nPRESIDENT ELECT HARRIS\nR.C.S. A.G.M. by ROBIN SALMON Chemistry Lecture theatre B this year saw\none of the noisiest A. GjM.'s for some time.\nOn Tuesday, May 24th250 people assembled\nto see the last rites performed over the an-a en regime.\nThe preliminary formalities were dealt\nwith quickly by taking a large portion of the\nminutes as read, and then Mr. Bogod, the\nPresident of R.C.S. A. sought to encourage\nmembers to join the Association by pointing\nout the benefits which membership conferred\nAfter he had finished his speech he left quids,\nly as if he foresaw the barrage which was\nshortly to fall on the front bench.\nAfter the reading of the Annual reports,\nthe next item on the agenda was the announcing of the recipients of social colours, an\naward given in recognition for services performed for the Union not covered by the\nAthletic awards. The Union also approved\na suggestion by the President that Dr. Hills\nthe senior treasurer who is leaving to take\nup a post elsewhere, should be awarded social colours.\nAs the Elections began, a barrage of flour\nbombs and eggs was hurled, Mike Harris,\nthe secretary receiving a large proportion of\nthe missiles with less than gentlemanly grace.\nThe most keenly contested election was for\nthe post of trophy officers, in which Alan\n(Booboo) Smith and Dave (Gimme the Boats)\nDean were successful. In the meantime, the\ncustomary beer was passed round Union\nmembers in the various cups which R.C.S. have won this year, and the health of the\nUnion drunk.\nFor the positions of President and VicePresident, there had been only one nomination each, so the candidates were declared el-ec ted. They were: \u2014\nPresident \u2014 Mike Harris.\nVice-President \u2014 Chris Tye.\nAfter the President's Report, in which Finlay McPherson spoke of the tremendous spirit and co-operation which he had felt behind\nhim all year, the handover to the nouveau x hommes was carried out, amidst further\nbroadsides from the ranks of the anarchists.\nRelations by the executive heightened the\nchaotic atmosphere and \"wrought havoc among the militant mob.\nThen followed the customary votes of\nthanks, the awarding of posts, and the shaking of hands, and the new President rose for\nthe Kangella, but could not quell his mutinous minions who chanted, \"To the\nQueens\", \"To Guilds\". \"To Hell\".\nMINES UNION MEETING by J. CORNISH\nThe last RS M Union Meeting was held on\nThursday, 17th May. Some belated elections\nwere held, mainly due to the absence of the\npeople concerned at the previous meeting.\nAmongst these, George Manson was elected\nEnts. Secretary, and Nigel Gracette the Cabaret Manager. Three Sports captains were approved : Cliff Davis (Swimming), Fred Nicholson (Athletics), and Craig Dunn (Boxing).\nThe Petroleum Engineering Society proposed that they would become an integral\npart of the London Institute of Petroleum\nEngineers, the main object being to obtain\nextra funds, and the motion was passed. Minor changes were made in the constitution of\nthe Mining and Metallurgy Society. Graham\nHachen apologised to the Union for the absence of Clementine in the Carnival Procession, but explained that the mascot was on\nthe sick list with gasket disorders. An early\nrecovery was expected.\nThe latest world record to be broken by\na Minesman was announced: two minutes\neleven seconds to swill two dozen eggs. Mr. Heape stated that he readily accepted the\nchallenge of the Dagenham bird who has\nclaimed 90 seconds in practice; he considered\nthis impossible.\nDuring his retiring President's report, John\nFairfield ceremoniously mounted the Presidential Throne, a fine piece of vitreous china\nby Thomas Crapper and Sons of Chelsea.\nAfter a fine report on another successful\nMines year the throne was handed over to\nSpud Oldfield, who presented the retiring President and Secretary with tankards filled with\nFinal Selection. These were drunk to the\ntraditional calls of \"Up, up\". The meeting\nclosed with a fine rendering of \"Cat\" led by\nthe new President seated comfortably on his\nthrone.\nSMALL AD.
