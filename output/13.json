Correspondents\nmust supply their name and college but they may\nwrite under a nom-de-plume if they wish. The\nEditor takes no responsibility for the opinions\nexpressed by corre sp on ents. City and Guilds College.\nTo the Editor,\nFELIX. 3rd November,1950.\nSir,\nWe would like to state how much we deprecate the action which took place this morning,\nresulting in the de bagging of the \"Daily Worker\"\nsalesman.\nThis behaviour on the part of a large crowd\nof students towards a fellow citizen of a democratic country is in the worst \"communistic\"\ntaste, and is a very bad advertisement, ex pee i al ly when the student body is protesting against\nthe suppression of ragging. The only good it can do is towards the Communists themselves.\nSurely these rags, if they are to survive\nas a healthy form of student high spirits, should\nonly take place between students and colleges.\nOnce they are taken out to the general public\nthey become anti-social and merit the disapproval they now enjoy.\nThe C.&G. Union President's remark that\nexcess energy is more profitably dissipated in the various athletic clubs is surely good ad-vice.\nThe Engineering Society,\nCity & Guilds College.\nTo the Editor,\nFELIX. 5th November, 1950.\nAt the final meeting of the now dissolved\nImperial College Student Industrial Committee\nI was requested to investigate the possibility\nof holding an annual conference of the Academi c Societies. This conference was to concern\nitself mainly with social aspects of industry,\nbesides providing a meeting ground for the\ninterchange of ideas, and the discussion of\ncommon problems.\nI am accordingly calling a meeting of the\nofficers of the societies concerned and should\nbe much obliged if you would publish this le tter in order to give individual members a chance to inform their officers of their points of\nview.\nTours faithfully, E.C.

May I, as a semi-\"brown-b agger\", be\nallowed the hospitality of your columns to reply to this?\nSurely it is the man with the good degree\nwho brings most honour to the College in the\nworld outside. I can imagine an employer say-ing: \"These fellows from C.& G.(R.C. S.,R. S.M) do not know their stuff!\" He does not care\nwhether they were arrested on a certain occasion due to excess of College spirit, or were\nmembers of fifty societies. Again, it is the\nacademic record of the College which induces\noutside bodies to sponsor research fellowships\nand other grants and to make large gifts to the\nCollege, e.g. the Goldsmiths extension to C.&G. May I suggest that the maintaining of a flow of Ist and 2nd class Honours Degrees is essential to the existence and well-being of\nthe College rather than a mammoth social and\ncultural organisation.\nYours faithfully, Dept. of Chem. Tech.,\nImperial College.\nTo the Editor,\nFELIX. 9th November, 1950.\nox J., We are inspired by the recent Lord Mayor's Show to write and suggest that the students of\nLondon University hold a similar (but much bet-ter) procession.\nAccording to its size, each college could\ncontribute one or more tableaux to illustrate some chosen theme such as \"Students through the\nAges\", \"From Kindergarten to the Professions\",\netc. etc. Lent term would be a suitable time\nand the occasion could be the inauguration of\nthe new U.L. U. President. Perhaps we could\npersuade the Chief Commissioner of Police to\nofficially receive the procession at Bow Streeb\nPolice Station.\nAdvantage could be taken of the occasion\nto make a collection for State ITn-aided Chari ties( such as the Police Orphanage!) which\nwould give us a measure of public support.\nAn annual student pageant of this kind\nwould be a great event for students and pub-li c alike and would provide a unique occasion\nfor intercollegiate co-operation. A little restraint would at first be required until our prerogative be firmly established.\nAll that is required is some enthusiastic\nsupp crt from the colleges and some hard work\non the part of a few efficient organisers.\n\"Yours faithfully, Ashley Bean,\nPeter Howe.'\nBernard M. Polack.\nCity and Guilds.\nTo the Editor,\nFELIX. 3rd November, 1950.\nSir,I feel it necessary to correct immediately a crass error in your last: you refer to Bo\nas \"she'.'\nThe name Boanerges, meaning \"Sons of Fury\"\nor \"Sons of Thunder\" was the name given to the\nsons of Zebedee, and later by T.E. Lawrence to\none of his mote r cycles.\nAnyone who has heard the present Bo's stentorian voice will realize that there is nothing\nfeminine about him, unless it be his somewhat\ncapricious nature, and so doubts as to his sex\nmust be quickly dispelled lest some misguided\nscientist should be tempted to shout \"Boanerges\"\nin a feminine treble at his next public appear-ance.\nYours faithfully, E.M.

    "content": "FELIX1 SOCCER\nC.& G.0,R.C. S.3 In the first round of the Technology Cup,\nplayed on Nov. 8th at Harlington, the R.C.S., present holders of the cup, deservedly defeated the Guilds 3-0.\n.Facing a young gale, Guilds spent most of\nthe first half defending stubbornly while the\nR.C.S. forwards seemed unable to make the most\nof their opportunities. There was no score at\nhalf-time.\nIn the fourth minute of the second half\nR.C.S. went ahead, Thompson putting the finish ing touch to good work by Dixon and Jackman.\nPlay continued unevenly until13 minutes from\n'ime when R.C.S. were awarded an indirect free\nkick in the Guilds penalty area. Dixon passed low across the goal to Browne whose first time shot beat Williams. R. CS. were well on\ntop at this stage, and, five minutes from the\nend, a free kick, taken by Manson, resulted in Jackman shooting into the bottom of the net.\nBoth goals had escapes, but R.C.S. appeared particularly fortunate when Reynolds failed\nto hold a high centre only for a Guilds toe to\nput the ball the wrong side of the post.\nThe teams were as follows:\nC.&G.: Williams (capt.); Wilkinson, Ward;\nHitchen, Eastland, Last; Jewitt,\nWheeler, Ball, Hailing, Morris.\nR.C.S.: Reynolds (L); Lodge, Manson; Webb,\nTaylor (RG), Buckroyd; Browne,Watson,\nThompson (DE) (capt.), Jackman, Dixon.\nA. A.G. RUGGER\nIn the first round of the U.L. cup, the\nI.C. XV drew 3-3 against last year's winners,\nthe Royal Veterinary College.\nIn the first half the Vets used the wind\nto great advantage and although I.C. played\nwell together and fought out much of the game\nnear the centre line, the Vets scrum half once\neluded server al players and made an opening for\na tx-y which was not converted.\nThe second half was played almost entirely\nin the Vets half, and in typical cup rug ger, the\noutside had few chances of working out movements\nlikely to lead to tries. It was through a pen-al ty, well kicked by Chester, that the match\nw'is drawn.\nI.C. can regard this match with some satis-faction. They played good robust rug ger against competent opponents and there was no 6b vio us manoeuvre by which victory could have been\nachieved. There are potential match winners in the I.C. side but the game just did not go their\nway. If they have nore to do in the replay on\nNov. 18th, I.C. should go through to the second\nround.\nS.R. Sparkes.\nBOXING\nThe boxing club gave Kings a good hiding\non Nov. 7th, winning five of the six contests.\nThe first match was between Coppelham and\nJ. Reavey of Kings. It was not until the 3rd round that the I.C. man came into his own, but\nthe end of the fight saw him a convincing win-ner.\nMike Humphreys, the I.C. Vice-captain,punished R. Gray so severely about the head that\nthat referee stopped the fight in the third\nround.\nAfter John Gordon-Smith (I.C.) had beaten\nP. Donniscn on points and Bill Favger (I.C.) had\nlost narrowly on points to A. Dujon, the Kings\nstar turn, we were entertained by what may now\nbe called \"the fight of the evening\".\nHulme, the I.C. Captain, stepped into the\nring to oppose L. Corsak of Kings. \" Killer\" lived up to his name for the fight had to be\nstopped in the third round. Corsak collapsed\nsoon after he had climbed out of the ring and\na double brandy was required to revive him.\nLast of all we saw the heavyweight contest\nbe tv/ een John B otter ill( I.C.) and E. Lucas of\nKings- John, thinking that he had to win his\nfight for I.C. to win the match went all out\nand with some damaging blows reshaped his opponent's body to his liking.\nAltogether a very successful evening.\nEVENTS\nFriday 17th Nov.\nI.

    "content": "FELIX MORPHY DAY\nBy our Bowing Correspondent.\nSome thirty years ago, the first race for the Morphy Cup took place, since when it has\nbeen won on five occasions by the R.S. M.B.C., three by the B.C.S. B.C. and on all others by\nthe C.&. G.B.C. This first race occurred ah-out the time of the formation of the Imperial\nCollege Boat Club soon after the first world\nwar, when the three College Boat-Clubs amalgamated to represent Imperial College in reg at tas. As the years passed, this amalgamation\nbecame more and more complete, and today the\nthree Boat-Clubs only exist for the purpose of\nan annual boat race between their respective\ncrews - at all other times their members row\nunder I.C. colours.\nIn 1943 each college had a second eight\nin training to assist in coaching their Morphy\ncrew. On a challenge from R.C.S. an unofficial race between these second eights was instituted and continued as a challenge match until19*6, when it became a permanent fixture by the\npresentation of a cup for the event by Mr. and\nMrs. Lowry - the Lowry Cup. Apart from an\nR.C.S. victory in1948, the Guilds have had a monopoly of this trophy.\nTHIS YEAR'S CREWS\nNext Wednesday, the three College Boat-Clubs\nwill again be competing for these two trophies.\nAt the time of writing Mines are undoubtedly favourites. They are a strong, workmanlike crew,\nwho attack the beginning really hard, with the\nfull intent of using the blade to move the boat.\nTheir chief weakness at the moment is a lack of\nsolidity at the finish, but in spite of this\ntheir recovery is good and lively with a nice\nswing forward as the boat runs. Mackay, at st roke is setting a good rhythm and a surprisingly long stroke for so short a man, and is well\nbacked up at seven by Maltby who rowed at Bedford School. Davidson is an enthusiastic six,\nwhilst Nind from St. Catherine's, Cambridge,\ncombines power with smoothness at five. The\nR.C.S., though they lack the surge of power on\nthe beginning which characterises the Mines crew\nis the neatest of the three boats. Thebladework is better and more together and the finishes more solid. The recovery, however, is slower and more ponderous with the resultant lack of\ntime on the last bit forward, causing a sluggish\nbeginning and not so much run on the boat. Sly\nfrom Tiffin s School at seven and Seaman from St.\nPaul's at six provide a good backing for Metcalfe who stroked last summer'sI.C. boat at Henley.\nThe \"heavies\" in the middle of the boat are neat\nbut inclined to be slow with their hands away.\nThe Guilds are not so far advanced as their ri vals , and though working hard are not so well together and still inclined to be rough and heavy\nhanded. However, with North as Cox (worth a ninth oar in the boat) and Johnny Miners on the\nbank, they will undoubtedly improve rapidly during the next week and will be a crew tote reckoned with by Morphy Day. A few deeply rooted fau-lts in some members of the crew may, however,\nprove to be too much should it come to hard race\nand a close finish. PROSPECTS\nAt the moment the Mines look the crew most\nlikely to win, but a race of one and five-eighths\nmiles in a heavy clinker boat is no respect er of\nreputations, and much may happen in the next week.\nThe Guilds look like winning the Lowry Cup\nagain, their crew having much more experience of\nracing and regattas than either of their opp on ents. The latter crews, however, will give a very good account of themselves and are not Likely to be left behing without fighting hard. The\nextreme lightness of the R.C.S. compared with the\nMines may tell against them over the latter part\nof the course should they have the misfortune to\nencounter a stiff head wind.\nThe races will be started by Charles Briston from the towpath and umpired by Freddy Page\nof the Thames Rowing Club from the Umpires' lau-nch. The judges will be Mr. G.C. Lowry and\nMr. R.D. Hoyle.\nCROSS COUNTRY\nThe U.L. trials and subsequent I.C. trials have proved most encouraging, and although Ted\nWhitlock is once again the only really outstanding runner, the general standard is quite high.\nThe second team started off very well on\nWed, Nov. 1st, beating U.C. and Q.M. C. quite\nconclusively, by vi r tur of some very good pack-ing. I.C.'2',39U. C'2',71Q. M.C.'2',76. The 1st team had their first match of the\nseason against Southampton University on Sat.\nNov. 4th, over 4& miles at Roehampton; although\nwithout the services of Whitlock, who was running for U.L., the team won quite easily.\nI.C.32S 'ton 51.\nThe packing was again very good, I.C. providing seven out of the first nine men home.\nGoater (S) was first, in27 min. 29 sec.,\nand Davies (I.C.) second in27 min. 33 sec.\nWOMEN'S HOCKEY\nOn Wednesday, Nov. 1st, the I.C. Women's Hockey XI played Goldsmith's2 nd XI. This\nwas the first women's team to be fielded for\nabout 2 sessions, with the exception of the\nteam which met with s ecce s s in the Inter-Collegiate tournament. As this is the case, and\nas there was no opportunity for trials, the fact\nthat I.C. lost 3-0 need cause no despondency.\nThe players combined well on the whole, and once the forwards get used to playing with each\nother, and the half-backs play a more attaching\ngame the team should have a reasonably successful season.\nI.C.

    "content": "FELIX PROFILE\u2014 A.V.5. DE REUCK\nMr. A. V.S. de Reuck is Chairman of the\nSocial Clubs Committee, Vice-President of R.C.3., Editor of \"Phoenix\", a fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society and studies Physics in his spare\ntime. As he has been on the committees of a number of College societies at one time or another,\nwas a member of the Rifle Club, and once played\nBridge, it is likely that very few readers will not know him. However, for those who do not,\nhere is a summary of his personal appearance.\nLook out for a Union officer who is fairly tall, sports a moustache and w \u00abars glasses. (This\ndescription also fits Wally, the Porter at R.C.S., but as Wally works there, no confusion should\narise.)\nHis early personal history started with a oh il d hood of fairly normal Freudian complexity.\nLater he returned to school, now as a teacher of\nphysics, being on deferred service with the RA.F. Subsequently he served abroad in India and later\nin France. On the nights when he is Duty-Officer\nin the Union, he may recount to you,in the Bar,\nthe many hair-raising experiences he faced during\nhis term in the Service. The most unnerving of\nthese seem to have occurred during social evenings\nin the mess1. And so he came to Imperial College, in 1947.\nOn arrival here, Tony soon distinguished himself\nas a first-rate speaker whose words, if not few,\nwere at least well chosen. Despite being accused\nof immorality by a lady from Bedford, he was\nelected President of both the Political Society\nand the Literary and Debating Society for the\nsession 1949-50. He achieved the distinction of\nbeing the first post-war President of the Political\nSociety to surmount the academic hurdles and return\nto take up his political duties\nAt the request of the President of I.C., Don\nHuddart, he agreed about this time to take up the\nEditorship of \"Phoenix\". Since he has been Editor,\nTony has completely transformed this worthy bird,\nincreasing its volume by his ingenuity, and its weight by his editorials.\nIt might be thought that a man who takes such\nan active interest in College life would have well\ndefined opinions upon fundamental subjects,(e,g. politics, religion and beer), but his ideas here\ntend to be eclectic. Thus in Union politics, when\ntalking to a reactionary he is progressive, while,\nwhen discussing affairs with progressives he is a positive reactionary. It is noteworthy that he is\npractically the only member of the \"Phoenix\" board\nnot an agno s it c. When I asked him what beer he pre-fer red, he merely said \"Thank you. I'll have half\nof mild.\" Nevertheless, he is prepared to discourse upon a large variety of lesser topics and,\nIndeed, with his interests varying from Greek\nscience to heraldry, and from planetary at mo so here s to oratory, Tony is either the last all round genius or the first I.C.d ill ett ante.( He is clean, healthy and rides a bicycle. - Ed.)\nLUNCH -HOUR RECITALS\nTHURSDAYS 115 BOARD RM.

Hangeur de Strappe in a lecture to the Ecole des Chemins-de-fer entitled\n\"La Tie et 1'Amour au Paris-Metro\".\nA lengthy paper on the subject was recently\ndelivered to a vociferous audience in the Union\nBar by Mr. Tuber, dealing with the economics, time\nand motion study of tro glod y tic ally travelling\nbodies.\nEconomically, the author showed how, owing to\nthe high passenger-velo o it y through the barriers,\nthe probability of non-payment of fares was some\n4$ higher than that in the case of bus travel. The\nauthor listed and described some 376 occasions when\nhe personally had broken through this barrier-layer of humanity, whilst retaining hi3 ticket for\na future occasion.\nA time study, applying Einstein's gravitational fiddle, was not understood by anyone, including the author. He stated, however, that provided DirektstrBm remained unbroken, the bus was\nslower.\nThe motion of bodies was observed to vary with\nage. Thus, young male persons displayed a74$ \u00ab tendency to fall into the arms of date-worthy steno-graph ers, whilst only 39/\u00bb of the dapper businessmen displayed this characteristic. The ogling eye\ncommon to both categories was more marked in the\nlatter case. Of the opposite sex, an astoundingly\npainstaking research was conducted, as was to be\nexpected. Out of 1,000 subjects studied, 130 were\ndiscarded on sight (being classified as bass-viola\nplayers, etc., en route to R.C.M.)610 were helped\nto their feet and dropped rapidly on their uttering\nthe words \"Thenks ever so, I'm sure\". The fate of\nthe remaining 260 was not stated.\nA discussion followed, interesting points\nraised being:-\"What about the Polyphase Shunting\nMotor?\"\n\"The flux is proportional to the\nfifth power of the weight of\nsolder present.\"\n\"What about the Russians?\"\n\"This matter will be dealt with at\nthe next Guilds Union meeting.\"\n\"What about your last orders?\"\nMr. Prodmore:\nThe Author:\nA Voice:The Author:The Barman:The meeting was o lose d.X.

This is disappointing\nas there is no reason at all why they should not be\njust as strong as last year's winning team and it is\nfortunate that our first two opponents have not produced any serious opposition.\nA cup team playing University players can never\nbe quite so satisfactory in team work as the regular XI, and at this early stage it is not fair to be\ntoo critical, but I would like to see more 'zip'\nand much more decisive play. At present it is far too\njerky - fast runs, then seconds of indecision; or a good movement into the opponents goal area, then a pass\nwell behind the circle. Twice as many goals should have\nbeen scored in these two matches.\nHowever there is no reason at all why all these weaknesses should not be remedied and our next opponents,\nKings College, soundly beaten. We want more drive and\nhard persistent attacking in the last twenty-five yards,\nso go to it I.C'.'. A.S. "

Gilbert, consider that a policeman'slot is not a happy one,\nmust surely have revised their opinion on November 4th. That evening some eighty representatives of the law exchanged such arduous duties as pounding the beat in Paddington or being\nknifed in the back in Battersea for the privilege of witnessing a free firework display in Prince Consort Road while technically protecting\nIC from the lawless mobs of Kensington.\nIt is true that a further force of forty\nwere less fortunate, for they spent the whole\nevening in a quite unnecessary and remarkably\nchilly vigil around the Albert MemorialSubdued by the sight of so much sombre\nblue serge, the crowd behaved as though on a Sunday School outing. A few faint 'boo malak as1 were heard on the lawn, a little water was\npoured out of upstairs windows of the Hostel,\nand some kindly soul attempted to warm up one\nof the constables by placing a lighted fire work in his belt. Even the bangs sounded apologetic and law abiding compared with last\nyear. As so Ue one in the crowd remarked, \"It's a poor show when the only source of amusement\nleft is to raid your own college!\"\nAnd at about 11pm our one hundred and twenty protectors drove away in their blue limousines to enjoy their hard earned sleep.\nMINERS' NIGHT IN\nAnyone present at the Mines Freshers' dinner on the 3rd must have found the Guy Fawkes\ncelebrations on the 4th rather an anti-climax.\nAfter a preliminary warming-up at the Catherine Wheel, Kensington Church St., guests and\nhosts returned to the Union, where an excellent\ncold meal was provided by the refectory. The\nBread Rolls were just crisp enough to disconcert the recipient without actually marking him\nfor life. When he could make himself heard, David\nGriffiths was surprised to find himself prop os ins the health of the Mines. His speech, mostly quoted from odd scraps of graph paper, was\nnot so much woolly as downy.\nIn reply, the Dean, Professor Dannatt, made a short but sincere speech in which he coined us a new collective noun - a \"frenzy\" of\nfresher s. Proposing the health of the fresher s Peter\nHaywood, the President, welcomed them in a well\nconstructed and witty speech, sym pathi sing with\nthem for the their present partial exile in the\nR.C.S. Much stress was laid on the Mines' spi-rit. On discovering to his chagrin that you\ncouldn't drink it, your correspondent returned\nto the free barrels and fell into a deep melancholia which prevented him from reporting in det ail what he believes to have been a first class reply on behalf of the fresher s. Worn out by thumping on the tables, the mob\nthen filed downstairs for the real business of\nthe evening.\nCHELSEA IN & OUT\nUp till now we had seen only what might have\nbeen expected of a Mines Freshers' Dinner but first class and spontaneous entertainment followed. The\nupstairs hall was invaded by a crowd from Chelsea\nPoly with obvious aggressive intentions. The drinkers left their emptying barrels and, joined by\nother I.C. men from downstairs, kept the invaders\nat bay. But the Polytechnlcians soon found that\nthey had stepped into a hornet's nest.

Man behind barricade\ninjures four police\nFIGHT IN COLLEGE LABORATORY Evening Standard Reporter\nCour policemen were injured in a fight with a man who\n^ barricaded himself in an underground laboratory at\nthe Imperial College of Science, South Kensington, S.W. Police were called to the\ncollege last night after it was\n~\",\n\"\"'*f^d that a mr *\nw>e Con\nHou\ning t. motu i cars\ntracks\nnorth\nMr\nThe Royal College of Science featured in\nfront page news in the 'Evening Standard' on\nMonday, 6th November. On Sunday evening, about 9-0 o 'clock, a31 year-old seaman invaded\na basement research laboratory of the Geophysics department and, wrenching the legs off a heavy table, started to smash up apparatus.\nTHEY USE HOSES, HE THROWS BOLTS\nThe noise was heard by Mr. Folkierski who\nwas working late. He rushed down to the source\nof the noise, thinking there had been an ac cid ent, and entered the room to investigate. He\nsoon withdrew, however, to avoid an iron bolt\nhurled at him by the visitor. Mr- Folkierski\nfound the night porter who 'phoned the police.\nTwo policemen arrived and called on the miscreant to lay down his weapons and come out (he had\nby this time barricaded the door). The only\nreply was an iron bolt through the window. A hurried consultation resulted in the departure\nof one policeman to summon reinforcements, leaving the other expostulating: \"What do I do if he comes out?\" Eventually over a dozen policemen arrived together with a Black Maria and an\nambulance. Meanwhile Prof. Sir George Thomson,\nthe Dean of Residence (Mr. D. Allen) and Mr. D.K. Nicholas were informed by telephone and arrived on the scene soon afterwards. They were to\nwitness an amazing sight. The police, unable\nto extract the miscreant peaceably, connected\nup a hose to a hydrant and stood oy pending the\narrival of a doctor. However, action was precipitated by the sound of escaping gas: fearing\nan explosion, the water was turned to cool the\nvisitor's ard our. Instead, it only filled the\nroom with steam for the hose had been connected\nto the hot water main t It provided sufficient\ndistraction, however, for the police to close\nin and Get Their Man. It was 9\u00ab40 when he was\nfinally taken away to St. John's Hospital, Battersea.\nTheories as to possible motives for his behaviour range from - an act of personal revenge\non science for being blown up during the war -to - a result of seeing the film \"Seven Days to\nNoon\"!\nthe invaders out. The latter had rather a rough\npassage as a band of host elites were waiting to\npush their way in again. In this encounter we won\ntwo pairs of trousers but lost one pair of shoes.\nA counter-attack found our invaders licking their\nwounds in Queens Gate. Another two of them were\ncaptured and obliged to surrender their trousers.\nBack in the bar one of our de bagged captives,\nwho claimed to be their president, was made to drink\na yard of water, and a messy show he made of it too.\nWe had captured four pairs of trousers, but I could\nonly see three dispossessed owners - I was told\n\"you should have seen the one that got away\".\nFor the rest of the evening a firework display\nwas held outside the bar. A cracker which landed\nin a jug of beer so thrived on alcohol that it blew\nthe jug and its contents all over the room. There\nwere no fatal casualties.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX3 EDITORIAL\nFELIX prides itself on maintaining a politically independent outlook, and though in this attitude we\ndiffer from the 'Daily Worker' we nevertheless regard\nthe de bagging of their student-salesman as unfortunate\n- and not in the best taste. On the other hand we\nare sure that the incident took place less from\npolitical motives than to demonstrate the folly of\ntrying to sell the Daily Worker so close to our\ndoors. And the salesmen themselves must surely have\nrealised the risk they ran. That being said we were\nagreeably surprised at the restrained tone of the\npamphlet which was distributed with the Daily Worker\na few days later (see this page); the pamphleteer,\nhowever, laid himself wide open with his sentence;\n\"If they have a better paper then let them sell it themselves\"'. The reply to this on the following\nWednesday was sufficiently urbane to close the affair\nwith a smile.\nThere have been a spate of rags recently. The\nBattersea Polytechnic caravan started things off.\nThen a party of i.C. men - mostly fresher s made\nun fruitful visits to Battersea, U.C. and Kings; in\nsearch of consolation prizes they raided Chelsea\nPolytechnic. Whilst applauding their zeal and enterprise it was perhaps a little unfair on the Poly:\nsurely we should hit only someone of our own size\nand stature? The Massacre of Mines Night (p.l) demonstrates what may happen when a smaller college\nis goaded into retaliation'.\nWe hope that the foregoing remarks will in no\nwise dampen enthusiasm and initiative. These will be required in full measure in the tow-path battle\non Morphy Day'.\nI.C.D. S. ARMS & THE MAN\nL.U.D. S This is by way of an explanation of the production of \"Arms And The Man\" which is being put on\nat I.C. on November 28th December 2nd inclusive.\nAt the end of last session U.L. U. appealed to\nthe Presidents of the various Colleges to obtain the\nsupport of their Dramatic Societies for the London\nUniversity Drama Society which was badly in need of\nhelp. As a result of this, I.C.D. S. decided to offer\ntheir full support and the use of the I.C. stage for\nthe L.U.D. S. full-length Christmas production. This\noffer, approved by Council, was gratefully accepted.\nAlthough, strictly speaking, the play this term\nwill be a L.U.D. S. show, members of I.C. are well to\nthe fore and most of the well known names will be\nfound on the programme. We want to show the rest of\nLondon University just what I.C. can produce in the\nway of audiences as well as plays. We hope therefore\nto have the large, receptive and enthusiastic audiences which have always been a feature of I.C.D. S. productions in the past. You will see many of the\nold familiar faces as well as some new ones. We want\nthe support of you all, both fresher s and not-so-fresher s. The good old tradition of a 'Mines Night' will\nstill be observed (this time the Tuesday performance)\nwith specially reduced prices l When you read this the tickets will already be\non sale. If you haven't yet bought yours, do so\nIodav. Tickets are on sale in the library annexe\nfrom 1 - 2 p.m. each day, price l/ to 4/-.\nD.R. Knapp\nPresident LCD.aU.L. CONTRACT BRIDGE CLUB\nThe first General Meeting of this new Club,\nsponsored by I.C.C. B.C., took place at U.L. U. recently.\nMr. Louis Tarlo, who has captained England\nand was one of the British team which won this\nyear's European Championship, was there to represent the English Bridge Union and London County Contract Bridge Association, who gave us\ntheir blessings and offers of help.\nI.C. has by far the flourishing Bridge Club\nof the London Colleges, and it was fitting that\nBob Pearce should be elected the First President\nof the new club. John Hunt, the new Secretary,\nalso comes from R.C.S. Following the meeting, Teams of Four and\nPairs Contests were held simultaneously, over\n100 players comp eton g.T. G. Gilchrist Wilson.\nNEW PERSONALITIES\nDr Smith-Cohen, lecturer in comparative mora ii tv? and Miss Gloria Glyndbourne photo g rap ned recently on Imperial Institute steps. Miss Glyndbourne will lecture on 'New o \u00ab \u2022\nu \u201e+,-,^on+<!i Tt is expected that ner nes i i!^^f hUt eon the subject will arouse considerable\napproach to the\ninterest.\nInternational Student Service is an organisation serving students and staff of universities\nall over the world. It is an entirely non-politic-al body and has no connection with the International\nUnion of Students. Its purpose is to help students\nto better their material conditions of life, and to\nextend and develop cultural activities within universities, so that they may become real centres of\nnational and international life. I.S. S. works towards this end in two ways. It\nruns international centres and -study tours in various countries - next year in Scandinavia, Germany\nand Italy, and conferences are arranged - the next\none being held near London in the week before Xmas.\nThe second,and perhaps more important,way in\nwhich I.S. S. works is by giving relief for students\nwhenever they are in need. Thus, students are being sent food, clothing, textbooks and medical sup-plies. Again, in South Africa many native students\nare studying medicine only because of help from\nI.S. S. Now the money for this relief work comes from\none source only - students. During this week -International Students' Week, November 12th18 th collections for I.S. S. are being held in colleges\nall over the country.\nThere will be a special Hop tomorrow night in\nthe Union, the proceeds of which are going to the\n1.8.3. Sanatorium Fund.\n(Information concerning any of the above\nprojects,or I.S. S. in general, can be obtained from\nA. A. Levy, I.S. S., Secretary, c/ oR.C.S. rack)\nWORKERS PLAYTIME\nOn the Friday on which the last FELIX\nwas published two students selling 'The Daily\nWorker' at the corner of Imperial Institute Rd\nwere invited along to the Guilds hallway where\nthey were de bagged by a party of students.\nOn the following Monday a pamphlet was\ndistributed entitled 'You may read what you\nlike' in which the dangers of physical attacks\non strangers are pointed out. \"Whatever you\nmay think of the point of view expressed in\n'The Daily Worker' it is the only daily paper\nthat puts that point of view. And many people\nread it just to see 'the other side of the\nquestion'.\"\nThe pamphlet ends \"Is it right that a group of students should decide what other\npeople may and may not read?\" \"If they have a better paper then let them sell it themselves\"\n\"Let the people decide for themselves\"\nFootnote: In answer to the penultimate sentence\nof the above, on the morning of the following\nWednesday two students stood on either side of\nthe 'Daily Worker' vendors and distributed\npaper bearing only one word of print.\n\n"
