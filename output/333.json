    "content": "Page 2 FELIX March20 th,1973 It's convert-the-Editor week!\n\"The letter kill eth, but the spirit give th life\"\n(2 Corinthians, 3:6)\nSir,\nSurely Karl Marx would\nbe turning in his grave if he\nhad seen the word \"logic\"\nsmuggled into the letter\nfrom Mr. Veall, who professes to be a follower of Marx\n(or is it Trotsky or Lenin,\nStalin, Mao, etc?). Logic is\nsomething we scientists are\nweaned on, presumably to\nuse, so let us use it.\nI have never in previous\nletters to \"Felix\" used\n\"arguments . . . in support\nof the existence of this person called Christ\" any more\nthan we use \"arguments\nin support of the existence\nof a of a person called\"\nJulius Caesar or Henry VIII.\nHistorical fact is not a rgu ment: I have qu ot ed Josephus, the Bible and\nTacitus, can we logically ignore the documents? Really,\nit requires far more faith\nthen to be an agnostic than\nit does to be a Christian! I feel, therefore, it is absurd\nto call these facts \"sheer\nnonsense\" and then to insult\nthe intellect of readers of\nthis newspaper by not giving\na coherent reason why they\n\"amounted to sheer non-sense\".\nOnce again it seems necessary to clarify the meaning\nof the word \"Christian\".\nChrist came to give us life:\n\"I came that they might\nhave life in all its fullness\"\nJohn 10 : 10.\nHe died because Man's basic problem is not only\ndistribution of wealth, God\nis not so myopic as was\nMarx, he knows our problems are far deeper, the\nBible calls this problem SIN.\nVery briefly, sin is man's wish for complete self-sufficiency, that is, a rebellion against God and our relationship with Him. Man is\ncapable of this SIN because\nGod made us \"in his own\nlikeness\" (Gen. 1 v26). God's will is free and so is\nours. Normally we choose\nourselves instead of God and\nwe cause a separation.\n\"All have sinned and fall\nshort of the glory of God\"\nRomans 3 : 2.3-In dying Jesus restored\nour relationship with God,\nprovided we accept his\ndeath for our sins. Furthermore in accepting Christ, He\ncomes into our lives as\nSaviour and Lord and gives\nus new life. Now I hope you\nwill have noticed I have not\nonce mentioned Church. This\nis simply because a Churchgoer is not necessarily a Christian, and Christianity is\nnot the Church that Mr. Veall\nhas nightmares about (re-member ing Sunday school at\nthe age of 10), but Christianity is a personal knowledge\nof Jesus Christ, the Son of\nGod. So it is quite possible\nthat large organisations we\nknow as religious often not\nadhering to their foundations\n(i.e. for Christianity personal\nknowledge of Christ and the\nBible, God's Word) have\nmade great moral mistakes.\nThese mistakes are mistakes\noccurring due to man's wish\nto take things into his own\nhands en masse and are\nanal ago us to such moral\nmistakes as we find in Red\nChina where schoolchildren\nare indoctrinated to hate certain races or classes, or\nas we find in Russia where\nalthough a front of religious\nfreedom is portrayed, the\nChristians I talk about, who\nconfess Jesus as Lord are\npersecuted. Even Kosygin\nsees the difference. Perhaps\n\"Religion\" in that sense \"is\nthe opiate of the people\",\nbut \"Jesus Christ is the\nlight for all people: And the\nlight still shines in the dark-ness\" John 1 : 5.\nSo Christ presented us\nwith facts, with his sacrifice\nfor our sins, a new life, and\nlife with him forever. It is a free gift from God, from a God who loves us. So what\nabout all the other things\nMr. Veall mentioned which\nhe thought suggested that\nGod doesn't love us? He\nsuggests starvation, massive\nwars, atom bombs, etc. As\nthe Bible explains man's problem is sin and these are\nthe result of sin. So I appeal\nto all reading this letter, realise God does not ask you to\nbelieve contradictions, but\ntruths, Jesus said: \"I am the\nway, the truth, and the life\"\n(John 14 : 6). God has made\nit far easier to believe his\nlogic than man's paradoxes.\nI pray that many more\nhard hearts in this College\nwill become followers and\nfriends of Jesus Christ and\nfind their true identity.\n\"God is faithful, by whom\nwe were called into the fellowship of His Son Jesus\nChrist, Our Lord\" (1 Cor. 2\nix).\nI remain,\nYours in Christ,\nMAURICE MOLONEY,\nChemistry II.\nP.S. \u2014 Perhaps Oily you\ncould persuade Ali (don't mind if I call you Ali, do\nyou?) to have a Theological\nPage next year; it would\nsave wear-and-tear on the\nmail bag. \u2014M. M.P.P.S. \u2014 / promise never\nto write a letter as long as\nthis again to Felix this Academic Year.\u2014M.M. Sir,In answer to Mr. Jock\nVealTs letter, I think that he\nis being not a little silly. He\nstates that the \"arguments\"\npresented the previous week\nwere \"sheer nonsense\". This\nis interesting because I did\nnot read any arguments, just\nfacts, and it is necessary to\ndistinguish between arguments and facts (it is note-worthy, however, that in\nGeorge Orwell's book of the\nfuture, \"1984\", the regime\nof the time changed historical facts to suit their own\nends). He \"stands logic on\nits head\" by doing this. If\nhe were to try and find out\nthe facts and then reject\nthem if he can, this would\nbe logical, but just to reject\nsomething out of hand just\nbecause it goes against his\nown doctrines is foolishness,\nespecially when Christ has\nso much to offer.\nIn saying that the previous\nweek's correspondents had\ncalled Christ a revolutionary\nindicates to me that he had\nnot read either letter proper-ly. It was an earlier correspondent who had called Him\nthis. However, Christ is a revolutionary in the true\nmeaning of the word, because he revolution is es individual lives. Mr. Veall\nappears to be very narrow\nin his definition of revolutionary, only taking the\npolitical meaning. A true\nrevolutionary is someone\nwho causes a complete re-versa l, which is what Christ\ndoes to individual lives when\npeople invite Christ into their\nlives, first by admitting that\nthey feel a need for Him\n(everyone does at some time\nin their lives), then confessing that they have been\nsinning against God (every-one does\u2014Romans 3:23),\nand then asking Christ to\ncome into their life and take\nfull control of it and become\nSaviour and Lord of their\nlife.\nIn most of the rest of the\nletter, he writes about re-li gion, NOT Christianity. This\nis a very common fallacy. It\nshould be noted that Christianity is not a religion.\nIn answer to Mr. Veall's question \"mystical or material (prayer or struggle)?\", I have found in the last year\nthat prayer is a far more\npowerful means for instigating action than belligerent\nstruggle which only comes\nup against a brick wall. How\nhe can talk about prayer, I do not know. He obviously\nknows nothing about its\nmeaning. It is a very complex\nsubject and even very old\nChristians do not totally understand prayer. As Paul\nsays in Romans, chapter\neight,, verse 26: \"For we\ndon't even know what we\nshould pray for, nor how to\npray as we should, but the\nHoly Spirit prays for us with\nsuch feeling that it cannot\nbe expressed in words\".\nAnyone wishing to find out\nthe real facts need only to\nturn to the Bible. If you still\nhave any problem, ask a Christian (easily found at the\nChristian Union books tall on\nTuesdays and Thursdays in\nthe JCR, or in the maths\nlibrary, first floor, 53, Princes\nGate on Fridays at 6.30).\nYours in Christ,\nDIGBY L. JAMES.\nCiv. Eng.2\nImperial College,\nLondon S.W.716 March 1973\nSir,\nThe only criticism I have\nso far received of my letter\npublished in 'Felix' a fortnight ago, was that, whereas\nI submitted that physical explanations for the miracles\nChrist was reported to have\nperformed were weird, the\ncritic felt that to say God did\nthem was far more weird.\nHis opinion stems, I believe, from our general\nreluctance to consider anything outside our physical\nrealm coupled with our\nenormous capacity to ignore\nthings which are not SEEN to\naffect us at the moment. I would like, in very basic and\nsimple terms, to explain why\nI feel this 'narrow-minded,\nmaterialistic' attitude to be\nfundamentally in error.\nIf you were to look up\nfrom this letter you would\nsee something. Perhaps some\npeople, or a wall . . . a grass\nfield, or maybe, just air and\nclouds should you happen to\nbe up in a balloon. No matter what you are looking at\nit will be made of atoms, so\nour scientist friends tell us,\nand from these atoms, which\nin turn are made up of\nsmaller particles of matter,\nour 'physical' universe is\nconstructed. We are also informed that, although the\nmatter may be rearranged or\nchanged in form, it is incapable of reproduction, creation and destruction. You will\nby now have guessed what\ncomes next. Yes, that's it,\nthe fact that matter does exist and yet cannot have\ncreated itself implies the\nexistence of something else.\nNo, not a Christian God, we\nhave not got that far yet, but\nwe can now make two inferences about this 'Thing'. It\nis non-physical; it defies at\nleast the physical law of 'no\nself creation'. Also it created\nthe physical universe.\nWe have up to now progressed using simple facts\nand deductions which are\navailable to and, I hope,\nunderstandable by all who\nread this letter, and I shall\nendeavour to extend this\nmethod to a second line of\nthought.\nConsider now the last time\nyou REALISED someone was\nin need of your help. Maybe,\nyou saw someone staggering\nalong carrying more than\nthey could manage, or it\ncould have been a friend\nasking for help at an inopportune moment. Whatever\nit was the following basic\nfeelings will have been pre-sent. You will have wanted\nto help, either because of a 'natural herd instinct' or because of selfish motives (e.g. the friend might do something in return). Conflicting\nwith this will have been any\nof a whole host of 'negative\nemotions'. For instance, you\nwill have realised that you\nwill be inconvenienced, that\nyou would be spending time\non something un beneficial to\nyou, and in the case, say, of\nrescuing someone in a burning building, that you would\nbe putting yourself in dan-ger. Thirdly your 'conscience'\n(I use this word because it\nwill conjure up to the reader\nroughly the sort of thing I mean, but I reserve the right\nto modify my meaning of\n'conscience' without reference to the normal dictionary definition) will generally\ntell you to help.\nNow the 'herd instinct'\nwhen it comes to unselfish\nhelp is rather weak. One\nmight say that the drive behind 'preservation of species'\nis small compared with that\nbehind 'preservation of self.\nSo one would then expect\nhelp to be rarely forthcoming\nwithout selfish motives. Yet\nhelp does come quite often.\n'Conscience'? More often\nthough we ignore our 'con-science' and do not do what\nit tells us. But it does not\ngive up. It keeps on nagging\nevery time we reject its\nguidance.\nA little expounding is\nnow necessary. 'Conscience'\ndoes not appear to be justified on solely physical\ngrounds. What, for example,\nis the physical reason for\nunselfishness? Also a 'con-science' appears to be a common possession of all\nmen. Furthermore, stop and\nthink about what the world\nwould be like if we were all\nruled by our 'consciences'. I feel it would be a better\nplace, but whatever you\nthink, it would be GUIDED\nCONSTANTLY towards one\nfinal state. Notice that no\nmatter how incomplete the\nmethod of deduction above\nmay be or what we believe\n'conscience' to be it does not\naffect the base and the end.\nThe fact that we have 'con-sciences' and that they are\nnon-physical. In both my\npoints, of creation and of\n'conscience', I am using\nonly facts which are just as\nevident and available to the\nreader as they are to me.\nSurely now our suspicions\nmust be aroused. We have,\nfrom earlier, an un-physical\n'Thing' creating a physical\nuniverse. We have an un-physical force trying to run\na physical universe; demonstrating that the physical has\nnot just been created and\nforgotten. Although, we\nhave this situation which\nmay be insufficient in itself\nto warrant action, it should\ndefinitely awaken us in our\nattitude to the non-physical.\nLet us now call up Christianity to see what it has to\nsay on these points. We read\nin John 1:1-5 (R.S.V.): \u2014\n...\"In the beginning was the\nWord, and the Word was\nwith God, and the Word was\nGod. He was in the beginning with God; all things\nwere made through him,\nand without him was not\nanything made that was\nmade. In him was life, and\nthe life was the light of men.\nThe light shines in the dark-ness, and the darkness has\nnot overcome it\".\nHere we have the creator,\nGod. We have the power\nbehind the world, God's Word, not only manifested\nin the world and ourselves,\nbut also written in The\nBible. And we have the\nWord's constancy both of\npurpose and of perseverance.\nSee also Genesis 1:1, 1 John\n1:1; Rev. 19:13; John 17:5;\nCol. 1:16; 1 Cor. 8:6; Heb.\n1:2, John 5:26, 9:5, 11:25.\n12:46, 14:6.\nThen in Romans 3:23\n(R.S.V.): \u2014\n\"Since all have sinned\nand fall short of the glory of\nGod\".\nHere we have our disobedience to God's Word.\nThe realisation of these two\npoints is fundamental to becoming a Christian. 1: God\nmade us and 'loves' us. 2:\nWe reject his 'love' and go\nour own way and so are sin-ner s. If we are still to call\nChristianity untrue, weird, or\na crutch for the needy, then\nconsider atheism. For that\nwe need to reject facts we\nknow and experience daily.\nWe need eventually td reject\nour very existence, so do not\nassociate atheism with logic.\nYours in Christ,\nROBERT SLOTA.\nCiv. Eng. II.\nOther letters\npage 3\nThe Landsnapper Sneeze\n\n"

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX March20 th,1973 FEEIX HNAKCIAEEY\nSumming up\nby Derek E. Gummings\nThis week sees the last article in the FELIX FINANCIALLY series which has been appearing in FELIX\nfor almost a year. The purpose of it all, above all\nelse, was to make an attempt to discuss some of\nthe practical financial problems that we are all\nlikely to run into at some time during our lives \u2014\nand to discuss them in non-technical, down-to-earth\nstyle. And in this, we have been able to call on\nthe expertise of our columnist and lecturer in social\nstudies, Derek E. Cummings (a man of whom it has\noften been said . . . but never proved!)\nWe think one of the best things to be said about\nFELIX FINANCIALLY and its impact is to record the\nfact that its disappearance from these pages has\nbeen received as good news in certain quarters.\nFor our approach to the subject has been, to say the\nleast, at variance with that of some of the more\nentrenched interests in the business. Cummings'\ncommonsense advice has often been provocative\nand always to the point.\nSo, who better to sum up what FELIX FINANCIALLY\nhas tried to say?\nI suppose it is inevitably true that for a large\nnumber of you at Imperial College, the end of this\nseries of FELIX FINANCIALLY will provoke a massive roar of indifference.\nI'm that much a realist, you see. I fully understand that not everyone finds the subject of finance\nthe most riveting topic in a world where there are\nso many other things to worry about. And I also\nunderstand that when you're scratching about trying\nto stretch a meagre student grant until the end of\nterm, such remote things as mortgages and house\npurchase have limited application.\nOn the other hand, I don't think I have been\nwasting my time. Apart from the fact that I have\nbeen able to help a considerable number of students\nwith direct advice \u2014 and that there are those among you who now own their own property as a result\nof such advice \u2014 I believe many of the things I have been trying to say are of such blindingly\nobvious truth that they will, in fact, come to mind when you yourselves are faced with the problem\nof ordering your lives in the great outside world. What I have been attempting is to clear away\nsome of the illusions and falsehoods which litter\nthe path of anyone who gets entangled in the\nnecessities of modern living . . . I mean such mundane things as buying insurance, getting a house,\nproviding for a family and so forth. And, let's face\nit, most of you are going to be involved in such\nthings, however remotely distant they may seem\nat this moment.\nMoney is going to be even more important to\nyou then than it is now. And what I have been saying on these pages for the past year is that you have to be careful and think before you spend it.\nAbove all, be sure you need to spend it before you start lashing it about.\nTake insurance, for example. It's one of those\nsubjects which really makes my hackles rise. I hate\nto see people being conned into buying insurance\nand believe me, never have so many people been\nso heavily conned by so few.\nIf you haven't already been approached by an\ninsurance salesman, you most certainly will before\nlong. They' ll urge you to buy the stuff for a multitude of reasons \u2014 for protection, as an investment,\nas a safeguard against a rainy day, as a kind of\nmagic formula for doubling your money.\nMost of it is just so much toffee. It's a pound to\na pinch of manure that you don't need it \u2014 for\nany reason. Not yet, anyway.\nThe time to buy insurance is the day you need\nit and not a day before. You' ll need it when you start a family whom you want to provide for in the\nevent of your death, or perhaps when you buy a home and want to secure that.\nBut if one of those policy-waving hustlers comes\nalong and tells you how you can invest in insurance for a few pounds a year and how the insurance company will double your money in twenty\nyears \u2014 forget it. However good it looks, it's a lousy investment. After all, inflation is doing much better at halving the value of your money faster\nthan any insurance company can double it.\nThere really is only one certain way of making\nsure your money increases in value, and that's to\nput it in the land. And I don't mean dig a hole and\nbury it, I mean invest in property \u2014 buy a house.\nIt is a big responsibility to take on, I know. But the value of property is always going upward and will always continue to do so since land prices\ninevitably follow the basic responses of supply and demand. As Mark Twain said: \" Buy land \u2014 they\nain't making anymore!\" Now, if you take those arguments to heart, I feel\nI 'll have achieved something. Just don't let yourself be chipped and swindled into putting your\nmoney into something that gives you a lousy return \u2014 even if it is dressed up in the clothes of\none of our big institutions. For when it comes to\nmoney, the advice the actress gave to the bishop\nstill holds good \u2014 namely, for heaven's sake, be\ncareful I Which brings me to the other side of the a rgu ment. Having the money, it makes sense to part\nwith it only after proper consideration. But where\ndo you get the elusive stuff? You want a bank loan\nor a mortgage? How do you go about it?\nWell, the answer is to shop around for them.\nThey are there, but it's up to you to find them and get the best deal you can. Some of you may remember that during a couple\nof my social studies lectures, I brought along a bank manager and a mortgage company manager.\nThey had a lot in common. Both were good blok es, both understood something of the problems students and graduates face, both had control of large\namounts of money \u2014 and both were of a new type\nof money man. Both are prepared to back their\nhunches. If they hear a good argument as to why they ought to part with their money \u2014 even from\na student \u2014 r they are more often than not willing to put their money where it's needed.\nThere aren't too many about like them. Institutions, banks, mortgage houses and insurance firms\nare still riddled with men who play it all strictly by\nthe rule-book, who won't take a chance.\nIf you have one of them as a bank manager \u2014\nthe kind of man who writes you a letter when you're\nthree pence overdrawn\u2014you're in the wrong bank.\nGet out, and shop around. Even if you've only a couple of quid to put into your account, go and sort\nyourself out a manager who makes understanding\nnoises.\nOf course, it's true that banks are starting to fall\nover themselves to get student accounts. You can hardly see into a bank window these days for big posters telling you how welcome you are and how cheap it is to bank with this or that bank. But banks are run by their managers. Remember, it's the\nman you're after, not the name on your cheque\nbook. The same is true of mortgage companies.\nTheir managers have a good deal of autonomy, too.\nIt's well worth losing a little shoe-leather to find\none who is prepared to listen.\nAnd, above all, remember that nothing is impossible. The mere thought of buying a house and burdening yourself with several tons of bricks and mortar and the need to go on making the repayments may well seem beyond you. But it's not\nnecessarily true.\nAs I said earlier, there are a number of students\nat imperial College now, who have done it and who have thereby given themselves a head start in\nthe scramble to achieve financial security. They\nlistened to advice and, I know, they think it well\nworthwhile.\nWhich brings us to the other point. It is nearly\nalways worth your time and effort to seek and find\ngood advice about your financial problems.\nUnfortunately, this again involves you in ferret-ting about for it. After all, there are a lot of sharks\nin the financial sea andaman in striped pants\nand a bowler hat can strip you of your money just\nas quickly as a man in a mask holding a shotgun.\nThere are bandits of all kinds waiting for the un wary.\nThe big institutions thrive on them. They make\ntheir money out of public ignorance. And oy the\npublic, I mean you some time in the future: and by ignorance, I mean not knowing what is bast.\nsafest and cheapest for you and your future depend-ents.\nI have a distinct loathing for people and organisations \u2014 great or small \u2014 who trade on this lack\nof knowledge. Time and again, in these columns and. in public, I have castigated insurance companies Who sell the public policies they don't need,\nbank managers who treat their customers like morons and the others in my own profession who grow\nfat by playing along with the system. I hope that one day successive generations will change the system, and I believe they will. But while it persists and you have to operate\nwithin its limits, then be sure that you make it work\nto your advantage.\nAnd the only way you can beat any system is to\nknowhow it works and how to avoid its most\ndangerous pitfalls.\nI hope I 've helped. The World\nneeds you!\nStart this year\u2014volunteer for V. S.O. Why Volunteer?\nDeveloping countries constantly ask for men and women trained in a wide variety of professional\nskills, to help their own nationals.\nIn addition, volunteering provides communication to take place between those in this country and their colleagues in the host country. Thus the\nvolunteering, whilst making a significant contribution to a country's development gains in personal\nexperience of a new culture.\nWho is needed?\nUniversity graduates (like yourselves) in engineering and science subjects.\nWhat sort of work?\nV. S.O.s objective is to supply s tort ages in manpower of developing countries. Few volunteers are\nengaged on relief work; most work on projects\nwhere their knowledge and skill can be passed on to\nothers. For this reason most volunteers are involved\nin some form of instruction either in classrooms,\ntechnical institutions, or informally.\nIn all cases volunteers are involved in responsible\nwork which needs doing cannot be supplied from\nlocal resources, it tests their ability and character,\nand in return gives them a vivid insight into another\ncountry and its problems.\nWhere is the work?\nIn developing countries of the world, in particular\nthroughout Africa, in the Indian sub continent, S.E. Asia and the Caribbean.\nV. S.O.'s primary concern is to ensure that a volunteer is posted to a job where his qualifications\nand skills have full scope, but also tries to comply with any soundly based preference expressed by\nthe volunteer.\nIs there supervision of work?\nVolunteers survive on their own merits, but ad vice by the British Council and the volunteers' personal V. S.O. contact is at their disposal if required.\nFor how long?\nAn offer of two years is encouraged, although\na minimum of one year is acceptable.\nWhen?\nMost volunteers fly out in August/September,\nthough a number go overseas in January.\nWhat are the terms of service?\nV. S.O. provides equipment and household allowances \u2014 transport to and from project \u2014 mid-term\ngrant of \u00a360 for 2 nd year volunteers \u2014 medical\nand accident insurance \u2014 are settlement grant of\nbetween \u00a3 1 0 0 - \u00a3 1 7 5 according to length of ser-vice.\nHost country provides free accommodation \u2014\nmonthly salary at local rate for your qualification or\nfull board plus \u00a33 per week allowance \u2014 free\nmedical care.\nIs there any training?\nSelected volunteers attend two courses during\nJuly/ August, one concerned with country of post-ing, and the other on professional skills.\nLastly V. S.O.'s aims\n1. To help developing nations solve their eco no mic, technical and educational problems.\n2. To build friendships between Britain and developing countries through working together.\n3. To provide the opportunity of widening sympathies and understanding through service overseas.\nIf you are interested, contact:\nV. S.O.,14 Bishops Bridge Road, London W26AA, Tel. 0 1 - 2 6 2 - 2 6 1 1 ;\nor get in touch with us: Pat Gorman, Min.I; John Branch, E. Eng.

My own personal attitude\ntowards MR A is not unlike my attitude towards the Sussex County\nCricket Club \u2014 deep respect and\nhearty approval of its aims, while\nlimitations of time and energy preclude the fullest disciple ship. Thus the new Revue \" GB\" cannot,\nindeed must not, be judged on the\nnormal, purely theatrical, grounds\u2014for it never pretends to owe anything\nbut pace to the modern, post\" Beyond The Fringe\", satire. The sketches are, often, extremely funny, and\nthe rather standard points are made\nwith a freshness that, in some places,\ncompares well with anything that the\nFrost-Cooke-Rushton heritage prod u ced. But even when a sketch falls\nshort of this (and it would be very\nmisleading of me to pretend that\nmany do not) there is always something there\u2014the supremely positive\nattitude behind the whole enterprise.\nSome of the songs seemed rather as\nif they had been rejects from \" The Desert Song\" \u2014 but the good ones\nwere very good \u2014 ( \" Cricket, Transport or National Health,/you can al ways rely on the Commonwealth\" sings an immigrant), \u2014 and they alt\nmake a point of some kind.\nSo where, asks the show, should\" GB\" go? There is no clear-cut\nanswer, and the show never pretends\nthat there is. All the modern vices\nget the pasting they rightly deserve \u2014\nthe greed of the Capitalist (\"It takes\nthe waiting out of wanting\" explains\nan armed bank-robber), the hypocrisy\nof the \" Freedom Fighter\"(\" Thou has provoked me into provoking\nthe e\"), the Commercial Christ\n( \" Jesus Christ, Superstore\") and inflation (\"It's not that we want much,/ We just want more\"). But anybody\nwho goes expecting a cut-and-dried\nanswer to National Destiny will be\ndisappointed.\nI have deliberately avoided mentioning the cast by name, for I saw\nan early preview in which they had\nnot yet fully settled into their mater-i al, and any comment I might make\nwould be obsolete by the time this\nappears in print. But two perform-ances, even now, deserve mention on\nany basis. Michel Orphelin, the\nFrench mime, does his \" The Fisherm an\" mime with a marvellous Gallic flair, \u2014 as well as one or two other\nneat cameos; and Mike Fields dances\nvery well throughout. His\" Behind the Barrel of a Gun\" song, \u2014 sung, gun in hand, darting furtively between\npatches of shadow, was the most\nstriking piece of the show, and recalled the ominous violence of \" West SideStory\". So, whither \" GB\"? If I knew, I wouldn't be writing reviews for\n'Felix', \u2014 but for anyone who cares,\nthis show could be very important.\nROBERT CARTER.\n19.00 i.C. Art Club.

Not having been to a concert for\nthree weeks I was beginning to feel\nthat something was lacking in my\nlife, so Saturday night I sat expectantly waiting for Can to appear.\nInstead I was greeted by the attempts\nof some peace freak in the audience.\nI was quite relieved that for most\nof the set he restrained himself to\nleaping about.\nCan' s music is very difficult to de-scribe. Not in any derogatory sense,\nI can only call it a pulsating drone,\nworking round a very loose basic\nstructure. One thing I can be sure\nabout is that it's definitely mood music, and in general there was a very intense communication between\nthe band and ' ^ a audience.\nEach of their numbers were very\nlong (about half an hour), containing\nseveral highs, and, not bearing a great\ndeal of resemblance to their album tracks, nor being introduced, I would be a brave man to try and list all the\ntitles, though perhaps \" Allelujah\" was\nrecognisable.\nOne thing that I found surprising\nwas the sheer length of their set.\nVery few bands nowadays are prepared to play for over two hours, so\nCan deserve full credit for giving\nvalue for money.\nG.J. K.I 've been telling my friends for quite some time now that Home are a fine band, and I'm not normally one to jump on the bandwagon just because\nJohn Peel, Bob Harris and all the music papers say so as well. Perhaps\nif any of them were at the concert on Saturday they would now believe me.\nOne thing is for sure is that lead singer Mick Stubbs does a better job\nnow than when he was a milkman. He had to pay \u00a320 when he gave up\nto put his books straight.\nIn opening their performance Home have joined a still small list of groups\nwho do more than begin by just walking on stage. Instead they played a passage from (I believe) Stravinsky's\" Rites of Spring\", strode on stage\nat the tumult of the crescendo and leapt straight into \" Dreamer\", a fine tight\nnumber, with Laurie Wise field's guitar playing sounding remarkably like that\nof Afbert Lee.\nThe rest of their set was rather similar, mostly fast numbers, occasionally\nwith a short spot in the middle for Wisefield to demonstrate his expertise.\nThe only smudge to their name I thought was when they asked if anyone\nliked rock ' n' roll, and delved into \" Roll Over Beethoven\". Surely they\nhave enough good material of their own without this needless inclusion,\nwhich is usually left to the amateur groups.\nHowever they redeemed themselves after this and finished with two\nnumbers rolled into one \u2014 \" Western Front\" with Wisefield changing o side guitar, and Stubbs to piano, followed by my favourite track \" Lady of\nthe Birds\", the vocals well developed, as throughout, for their kind of\nmusic. Previously, Bees Make Honey played for about twenty minutes before\nbeing joined by Frankie Miller, and warmed the audience quite well. G.J. K.A BOOK\nBasic Christianity by John R.W. Stoti.\nPublished by Inter-Varsity Press.\nThis is a book with, in one sense,\nnothing new and in another sense\neverything new. It tells of facts\nknown 1,940 years ago yet ones\nwhich are consistently misconstrued generation after generation. It is a book designed to be an introduction\nto a person, that person being Jesus Christ. Stott recognises on the first\npage the deference between the \" esa blis h ment church\" and Christianity.\nThe chapters are categorised under\nfour main headings: Christ's Person,\nMan's Need, Christ' s Work, Man's Response. Anyone daring to read this\nbook cannot fail to realise that the\nlife and death of Jesus is far more\nthan the best recorded fact in history,\nand that the Resurrection must not\nbe approached from the viewpoint\nthat it is impossible, unless you are,\nas Mr. Sherlock Holmes was, prepared to accept the impossible.\nThis book is very challenging, and only a very brave or foolish man\nwould dismiss it without a thought.\nIt is a\" must\" for people who wish to discuss Christian Theology and Jesus Christ, but who are ignorant\nof the facts.\n\n"

ISSUE No. 333\nFELIX IS\nTHE WAY\nTO LIFE\nCrusade starts page two\nAnd for the second\nRENT\ntime of asking\nAn Extraordinary General Meeting of Imperial College Union has been called for Tuesday at 1 p.m. in the Great Hall. A petition containing the required 130 signatures was collected last week.\nThe purpose of the meeting is to discuss the\nmotion below. Basically this calls for a rent\nstrike for next term to \"fight against loan\nfinancing of new halls\" and \"as part of the\nNational Grants Campaign.\" The motion was\nput to the Grants Action Committee at its\nmeeting last Friday, and was approved \u2014\nalbeit by a vote of four for four against. The\nvotes against were led by John Lane, ICU President, who wanted clauses 1 to 4 inclusive\ndeleted. Apparently all the members present\nat the meeting were in favour of a rent strike.\nA motion calling for a rent strike was put to\nthe first union meeting of this term, and de-feat ed. The left-wing factions were dissatisfied\nthen because the remainder of the grants\nmotion was passed overwhelmingly, and \"we\nwere left with all the policy but none of the\naction.\"\nNow lacking publicity, and with rapidly declining interest in the Grants Campaign, the\nmotion stands its chance of getting through\nonly in a meeting like this Extraordinary one\nwhere there is likely to be a good Soc. Soc.\nturnout and few others.\nThe Motion\nCATERING/RESIDENCE\nProposed by Trev Philips\nICU affirms the GAC decision to make one\nof the two central demands of the refectory boycotts, Total opposition to the \"self\nfinancing policies in re fec s. No price increases no cuts in portions \u2014 no closure of any re fec s. \u2014no redundancies or\nshort time for staff.\nfCU adds' to this that \" We must make the\nstate pay\" and \" Re fec boycotts and other\ntactics will be maintained if necessary as\npart of the fight against self financing and\nprice increases, etc. even if grants are in-creased.\"\nICU instructs the re fec, committee reps,\nto ask the college for assurances that there\nwill be \" no price increases . . . etc. (as\nabove)\". If the assurances are not forthcoming ICU\nto withdraw all representatives from the\nre fec committee until aUG M decided otherwise. ' '\nAs a further part of the campaign from\ndecent living standards ICU reaffirms the\npolicy that \" the DES must pay for all\nfuture halls\" and so I CU:i. asks college authorities to item is e separately the 3 5 p voluntary levy on\nhall bills; ii. will give full support to any student\nexercising his discretion over payment\nof levy.\nThis union recognises the urgency of the acc om mod ation situation in and around South\nKensington, the need as such for more\nhalls of residence and to fight against loan\nfinancing instead of subsidies for all future halls of residence. This union therefore advocates a rent strike starting from\nthe beginning of next term in order: \u2014\n1. to fight against loan financing of new\nhalls;\nii. as part of the national grants campaign. Day of\nBoredom\nWednesday's National Day of Action\nbrought with it even greater apathy and lack\nof participation than was apparent at last\nyear's Autonomy Day of Action. Lecture boycotts were not unsuccessful \u2014 attendances\nvaried between near zero to nearly 90 per cent.\nBut most of those that ried a story straight out\nboycotted lectures, predictably, stayed at home in\nbed. Attendance at the alternative syllabus took until half-past ten to reach\nthe fifty mark, despite having such speakers as Michael Duanne, th ex-head of\nRisinghill comprehensive\nschool, who caused such a of the NUS Press Service\nheadlined \"500,000 on\nstrike.\" It seems unlikely\nthat the strike will have\nany effect on anyone, l \u00a7ast\nof all the DES, who are\nstill refusing to do anything about student grants\nfrom next year other than\nthe \u00a320 increase in under-rumpus with his novel graduate grants that has\nideas of education in the\nearly 1960's. The other main speaker\nwas Mary Richardson,\nfrom the NUS Executive.\nDiscussion was held on\nbeen scheduled for two\nyears now. Mr. Norman St\nJohn Stcvas, under-secretary of. State at the Department of Education\nand Science, however, has\nsuch topics as the White intimated that he is will-Paper. Most of those at- ing to look into the ques-tending were from the politically active sections of\nthe IC Union Community.\nOther parts of the country saw little better res-pons e, although most\nnational newspapers car-tion of married women's grants. At present married women receive only\n\u00a3275 per annum against\nthe normal grants of \u00a3480.\nsubject to a means test on\ntheir parents income.\n\n"

    "content": "March 20th,1973 FELIX Page 3\n'The Fool says in his heart,\n\"There is no God\"\nThey are corrupt, they do\nabominable deeds,\nthere is none that does good'\n(Psalm 14)\nSir, ,\nI would like to point out\nseveral pieces of misinformation in Mr. Veall's letter,\npublished last week.\nFor the existence of a historical figure called Jesus\nthere is sufficient evidence;\nthere are few historians today who would seriously\ndispute that fact. On that\npoint there is little need to\nelaborate. Even Mr. Veall\nseems to accept it, despite\nhis statement to the contrary,\nas he went to great lengths\nto assert that this figure\n(who never existed in his\nopinion) advocated a philosophy of apathy to the plight\nof oppressed people.\nFirst of all, we should ask\nourselves what was the\nstandpoint of Christ concerning the oppression of the\nmasses. The message that\nChrist brought was one of\nlove for others \u2014 a love\nwhich was radically different\nfrom anything before it or\nsince (including the Greek\ntradition of Eros as formulated by Plato) in that it advocated selfless love for all\nother in divi du ails. The true\nmessage of Christianity has\nalways contained an ideology\nbased on sharing, and it\ngoes beyond socialism and\nthe trade union movement\n(although it is not opposed\nto them) in that it upholds\nand preserves a belief in the\ndignity and worth of the in-divi dual. An apathetic lack of\ncaring for the suffering of\nothers is diametrically opposed to Christian ideology\nand the teachings of Christ.\nI would agree with Mr. Veall\nthat often the institution of\nthe church has failed in active interpretation and representation of Christ's teachings but that in no way\nundermines their validity. If\n'God Soc' are guilty of apathy that is a failing of 'God\nSoc' and not of the Christian\nideal. As much as anyone I wish to see a liberation of\nthe under-privileged people.\nThe Christian message, if\nproperly interpreted, asks us\nto get off our pampered\nback-sides and do something\nabout it. It would be that\nmuch easier if the motivation\nfor helping arose from a genuine belief in the sanctity\nof man and his individual\nworth. Christianity is not\nconcerned solely with the\n'after-life'; its concern is\nhere and now as well.\nSecondly Mr. Veall's accusation of egoism might\nfairly be levelled against the\nmystical Eastern religions\nbut it is a fundamental error\nto attack the Judeo-Christian\ntradition on this point. In\nEastern mysticism the desire\nis for the self to be absorbed\nin the Universal Being. As\nfar as Christian theology is\nconcerned, once you have\naccepted God's existence,\nthen one's personal acts are\ndirected by His will, whatever it maybe. The true Christian is the o centric rather\nthan egocentric, and 'you'\nbecomes more important\nthan 'I'; he acts as ha does,\nnot through any fear of\ndivine punishment {if you\ndon't do as I tell you to, I 'll\ntake the goodies away) but\nbecause of his love for God\nand his desire to do His will,\nand his love for people as\ngood, God-created rational\nbeings; and he does this\nwhatever the consequences\nnow or hereafter. Mr. Veall\nalso implies that God is\ncreated by man, not vice-versa, and that the facts are\nanalysed in terms of how\nthey fit the self. He ignores\nspecific explicit divine revelation as described in both\nOld and New Testaments,\nquite apart from natural revelation available to us all\nwhatever our beliefs.\nFinally he makes the age-old objection to the existence\nof an all-powerful being- -the\nobjection being the existence\nof suffering. We are not puppets on strings to be made\nto dance at the whim of the\nCreator, because He did not\nmake us so. We are rational\ncreatures with free-will, distinct from one another and\nfrom God, capable of loving\nand creating beauty; capable\nalso of hating and hurting\nothers. It is theologically and\npolitically dangerous to suggest, as some Evangelical\npreachers do, that the solution to the world's problems\nis dependent on the conversion of the world to Christianity. We have got ourselves\ninto a mess and we are\ncapable of getting ourselves\nout. From a Christian stand\npoint it is easier to get things\nsorted out, but it is not impossible to solve a natural\nproblem by natural means.\nRevolution is not an end in\nitself, it can only be judged\ngood or bad by the end it is\naimed at, and the means it\nuses to get there. The ends\nof Christianity contain and\ngo far beyond the ordeals of\nsocial revolution, and its\nmeans are more efficient in\nthat it changes people, as\nwell as systems and structures. Mr. Veall has made\nthe very common mistake of\nequating and judging Christ\nand the Christian philosophy\nby the actions of the Church\nas an institution. Perhaps if\nhe made a closer study of\nthese teachings and this philosophy he would find that as\nfar as the social aspect is\nconcerned, they lead very\nmuch in the same direction\nthat his 'revolution' is taking him. In addition he has\nno guarantee that revolution\nwill succeed; there is a guar-an tee, however, that Christianity will succeed.\nYours sincerely,\nALEC MacANDREW\nCivics 2\nSir,\u2014In Jock Veall's letter of last week's Felix, he\ncriticised the Church as 'al-ways coming down on the\nside of the old reactionary\nsocial structure'. Surely Mr.\nVeall was referring to the\norganised Church which is\nnot necessarily synonymous\nwith Christianity.\nChristianity does not mean\nwearing a suit and trotting\nalong to church each Sunday, big black Bible under\narm. Christianity is a personal relationship vj it h God\nthrough Jesus Christ. Christ's message was one to build a new social structure NOT by\nchanging the social environment but by changing individual lives through love. No\nmatter what the social environment is, man is basically greedy thus to change\nindividual people is the only\nsolution. This is Christ's revolutionary message for everyone that He can and will\nchange your life.\nI agree with Mr. Veall\nthat the 'great hast ions of\nreligion' have committed\nterrible deeds which they\nsaid were done in the name\nof God. How could these\nhave been done truly in\nGod's name when they directly contradicted Biblical\nteaching? It is very important not to confuse\n\"religion\" with Christianity.\nYours sincerely,\nANNE MERRY\nSir,\u2014To any person who\ndoes not hold a Union Post,\nand is not a member of one\nof the left wing societies.,\nthe recent activities of the\nUnion can only be described\nas amusing.\nThe lack of interest in\nUnion affairs is supposed to\nbe due to Apathy. But I want\nto suggest that the real reason is that the Union's decisions do not represent the\nviews of its members.\nIf only just over 10% of\nall students at Imperial College are present at an EGM\nwhen a strike motion is\npassed, is it really any wonder that the strike is ineffective? And it must also be\nremembered, in the case of\nthe recent strike, that the\nstrike motion was only\npassed after a lot of man-o eu ve ring by the left wing\nto get the vote taken at a time when the meeting was\njust quo rate. Any realist\nmust admit that once the\nmeeting is quo rate, then the\nmore people that are present,\nthe less likely it is that the\nleft wing will get their way.\nTo the average student,\nall this mano eu ve ring is ir-relevant. Whilst obviously\nwanting a grant increase, he\nis not prepared to boycott\nlectures to get it.\nIn Elec. Eng. 3, for in-stance, there was at least a90% attendance at the 9.30\na.m. lecture. A handful of\npickets and a mere 50 people\n(approximately\u2014count taken\nat 10.30 a.m. in the Great\nHall) at the teach-in hardly\nsuggests that the college is\nenthusiastically behind its\nUnion. When those present\nat Union meetings are so un-representative, it is little\nwonder that so lew people\nthought it worth while to\neven vote in the recent elections. The best way to defeat the militant minority is simply to ignore them. Yours sincerely,\nPETER ADAMS,\nElec. Eng. 3\nSir,\u2014You may or may not\nknow that a recent Royal\nCollege ot Science Union\nGeneral Meeting mandated\nthe college authorities to\nprovide soft lavatory paper\nin RCS for humanitarian\nreasons. Now several weeks\nlater no action has been\ntaken.\nWe have therefore decided\nto mount a campaign for the\npurpose of forcing the college authorities to concede\nour claim.\nShould no action be forthcoming the sanitary facilities\nof RCS will be brought to a constipated halt. A small\ntaste of what is to come will\nbe experienced by the higher\nechelon of RCS tomorrow\n(Wednesday).\nRecently in America it has\nbeen proved by several eminent psychologists at Hardvard that hard loo paper can\nlead to impotence and suicidal tendencies amongst\nthose of tender disposition.\nWe hope that this letter\nhas highlighted the fact that\nthis is a very sore point\namongst students.\nYours TTPGD,\nSMITH 8 JONES (Alias)\nper pro RCS Loo Action\nCommittee.\nVOTE!\n. . but in\nGLC elections\nLots of people think\nICU is powerless and irrelevant and don't vote.\nLots of people think ICU are a waste of time and\ndon't vote. But no one in their right minds could\nsay that the Greater Lon don Council is any of\nthese things.\nThe GLC runs London\nfrom traffic system to development plans and as\nyou live here for at least\n30 weeks of the year you\nshould make sure you\nhave a say in how it is\nrun.\nThe April elections give\nyou this chance as you can\nvote in local elections here\nand at home.\nOf course most of us\nwill be on vacation, but\nyou can still vote by post\nand this can easily be\narranged: either contact\nme at 176 Keogh Hall( Maths I) or if you want\nto go straight to the\nsource contact\nGive your name, address here and vacation\naddress and we will see\nyou get your chance to get\nthe London you want.\nThis applies equally to\nall foreign students eligible\nto vote, i.e. Commonwealth, Irish, etc.; as students we are more at the\nmercy of local authority\ndecisions ort housing,\ntransport, etc. than most\nso it is to your personal\nbenefit to vote, and now\na word from our sponsor.\nThe Conservatives in the last few years have\nobviously failed to solve\nany of the main problems\nfacing the city. For in stance they have presided\nover the greatest rent and\nrates explosion in British\nhistory; the fact that their\nleader Sir Desmond Pl u mmer always manages to\nhave shares in companies\ndeveloping places like\nCovent Garden, Piccadilly\nand Soho is just luck of\ncourse!\nThe Labour Party offer\nno real solution, just the\nusual doctrinaire minor\nimage, i.e., be a tenant\nof the GLC rather than\nSir Desmond: some choice.\nThe Liberal Party is\noffering a real alternative\nto this with radical, obviously sensible solutions,\ni.e., cutting outside traffic\ninto London, expanding\npublic transport, getting\npeople the freeholds of\ntheir homes, eliminating\nfear of eviction and rising\nrents, adjusting the basis\nof rates to the companies\nwho make so much money\nout of a London location\ncan pay for the privilege,\netc.\nHowever even if you think all the parties are\nround the twist and just\nwant to spoil the paper,\nvote! Whatever party\nyou vote for the important\nthing is voting.\nELECTIONS\nBUREAUCRACY\nNomination papers are now up for the posts of\nPresident and Secretary of IC Union for the next\nacademic year, 1973-74. It will be the second time\nthat this election has been held; a fortnight ago,\nonly 540 people voted, a shortfall of 480 on the\nquorum.\nThe papers are on the Council noticeboard in the\nUnion Lower Lounge; names require a proposer and\ntwenty second ers, and only full members of IC\nUnion may stand. Both posts carry a sabbatical\nyear. The papers come down at 5 p.m. on Friday.\nThe Hustings will be held at a union meeting on the\nfirst Thursday of term, 3rd May, and polling will be\non the following Monday and Tuesday, 7th and 8th May.\nThe first issue of FELIX scheduled for next term\nis May 8th; however, in view of the elections, it is\nquite likely that a special issue may be printed for\nMay 1st. FELIX will at least produce a special\nbroadsheet for that day. This extra issue will, as\nusual, have space for candidates' manifestos and\nphotographs; the conditions of insertion are as detailed below:\u2014\nManifestos, which must not exceed 450 words in\nlength, must be sent to the Editor, c/o the union\noffice, no later than 1800 hrs on Wednesday, April\n25th. These should be accompanied by a passport-sized photograph, not exceeding 2in square. No\nmanifesto will be printed unless accompanied by\na photograph of the candidate. Manifestos exceeding 450 words in length will have the 451st and\nsuccessive words deleted. \" Words\" have the same\ndefinition as words on telegrams. (See Post Office\nGuide, p.377).

Everyone made it there\nand back without incident although one bike was only\nput together at midnight the day before.\nAfter the success of this ' Burn' we are going to\nattempt a long-distance \" Burn to the Broads\" (no\napologies) on the weekend ll th13 th May. See you then,\nBruce Cross.\nhockey UNIVERSITY OF LONDON HOCKEY CUP FINAL IC2 GUYS HOS P.0IC retained the inter-collegiate hockey cup on Wednesday at Motspur Park with goals\u2014one in each half\u2014\nfrom Mark Tatchell and Steve Tucker. IC had to make\none change from the side that beat Barts in the semifinal when Jaz Missan was required to play for Spencer\nin the London League on the same afternoon. However,\nhis replacement, Alan Brown, played very well considering that he was prevented from playing his natural\nattacking game.\nPlaying up the slight slope in the first half Guys\nimmediately took control of the match and virtually\ncamped in the IC half for the first fifteen minutes. In fact, they had a great chance to score in the first few\nminutes after a neat piece of dribbling on the right but\nSid Boulton did well to cut out the final pass.\nIC mainly relied on quick breakaway s during this\nperiod and even managed to find the net after a great\nrun by John Schofield\u2014who managed to find acres of\nspace\u2014but it was disallowed when three players crashed\ninto the net with the ball. After this play became more\neven and from another breakaway on the left IC opened\nthe scoring. Mark Tatchell received the ball on the\nwing, cut inside and slammed it into the net after\nrounding the goalkeeper.\nIn the second half Guys continued to do most of the\nattacking but fine defensive work, by Simon Tyrrell and\nSteve Tucker in particular, usually broke up the danger\non the edge of the circle.\nIC's second goal came from a short corner midway\nthrough the second half after a deliberate foul stopped\nDick Whittington in the twenty-five. This was magnificently struck by Steve Tucker and went in via a Guy's stick.\nGuys pressed strongly until the final whistle but they\nfailed to capital is e on the few chances that were created.\nIn fact during the match they had seven short corners\nwhereas IC only had the one\u2014but shots were only\nmade from two of them.\nThe whole IC side played well, the only black mark\nbeing against Iki Kullar for losing his temper midway\nthrough the first half.\nTeam: Sid Boulton; Simon Tyrrell, Dave Browne;\nDave Richman, Alan Brown, Steve Tucker; Dick Whittington, Iki Kullar, Jag Gahir, John Schofield, Mark Tatchell.\nmotoring\nWaking up on a Sunday morning with two hours\nsleep and thick fog is not the best way to gain enthusiasm for a day's excursion to Brentford Market. Nevertheless, by 10 o 'clock three courses were laid out,\nthe fog was lifting, and the cool morning air was\nthick with the tension of our seventeen arriving com-petit or s. Six of these were Cemian (so where are you all, you sci ving, cringing, lazy Guildsmen). To make\nthese events more successful we need you all, and\nanyway, it's great fun.\nSo with sc rut in ee ring, expertly handled by Charles\nLamont, and with far more than the usual cries of\n'Its too tight'??? The tests proceeded, after, of course,\na demonstration run by Boanerges himself.\nTests 1, 2 and 3 happened before lunch, with plenty\nof action, dramatic wheelers to the fore, and thankfully few crumpled bol lards. Complaints of minis losing oil pressure on, after all, a test that .was designed\nwith that in mind, were graciously rejected and the\nonly reverse spin I saw, was guaranteed to be unintentional. Even by lunch, the competition was hot.\nThe top three places being closely contended by 'Our'\nTony Raine and 'Their' Don Aris and Alan Winter.\nWith three lady entrants, things were getting quite\nheated in these quarters too, not to mention the saloons\nclass.\nThe afternoon saw the remaining six tests all of\nwhich appeared to run smoothly, and the boy racer\nbrigade were having a whale of a time on the further\nregions of the market. Did anyone not drive anyone\nelse's car?\nThe results speak for themselves, and to be fair\nto everyone, I will not comment on individual perform-ances, but congratulations to Tony for taking the overall awards and Alan Winter and Nigel Price (Cemian)\nfor the class awards not forgetting Dawn Hickman for being top lady although, to be fair,\nshe has had infinitely more experience than our two\nlocal lasses, who both showed striking sportswoman-ship.\nSo it leaves me to thank all the entrants, marshals\nand spectators with special thanks to Mike Drury\nfor sharing the organisation and extra special thanks\nto Mr. Raine for donating the trophy which spends its\nfirst year in the capable hands of his son Tony.\nJohn Baird.\nRESULTS Driver Car1 st Overall\u2014Tony Raine\u2014Spitfire\nOverall Places\nClass 1\u2014Minis and Imps\n2 1 Alan Winter Mini85032 Don Aris Mini85043 Malcolm Ridge Mini85094 Hugh Tyler Mini850145 Mart Clemour Wolseley Hornet 998\n16 6 Miss J.

It\npassed quietly away last Sunday afternoon at Shenley in\nthe presence of Northern Polytechnic. Despite an early\nattempt at artificial respiration by Alan Brown, two\nlate hammer blows finally put the last nail in the coffin.\nThe last rites were administered by Reverend Graham Popple.

The Illrds had reached the final by\nbeating I CV's in the semi final (plug for the V's). The opposition was supplied by Birkbeck IPs who had\nbeaten Bedford IPs in their semi final.\nA small faithful band of supporters who had managed to kick their mistresses out of bed early enough\nto catch the coach leaving at 10 \"a.m. turned up to\nwatch the match.\nBoth teams started nervously, particularly in defence.\nIC had the best of the opening exchanges with Geoff\nGilbert on the right wing providing the most trouble\nfor the opposition. The Birkbeck goalkeeper\nparticularly unsafe dropping ld ng shots and centres\ntant ali singly near the on rushing IC forwards. After\nabout 30 minutes of the first half Birkbeck went ahead.\nA long through ball down the middle caught the IC defence in some confusion, the Birkbeck centre forward\nchased the ball and his shot hit Rob Young on his\nback and unfortunately the ball went straight to a Birkbeck forward who made no mistake in putting\nthe ball into the net. This goal had a bad effect on IC, they seemed to lose concentration and were lucky\nto go into half time only one goal behind.\nThey hadn't regained their concentration when a few seconds after the restart the Birkbeck forwards\nforced a corner on the right. The corner was taken\nand the Birkbeck centre half who had come into\nthe penalty area unmarked had a fine header, he\nheaded the ball into IC's six yard box where a Birkbeck forward had another free header on to the\nbar, the ball rebounded to same forward for yet another\nfree header this time into the net.\nThe Illrds might well have been expected to fall\napart after this further setback but led by their captain Ian Hyslop they fought back. They managed to\nwin more balls in midfield. They produced some ferocious tackling\u2014one particular \"tackle\" by Ian Hyslop\nearned him a fierce lecture from the referee. IC brought\non their substitute Bob Day for John Giles in the\nhope of getting more penetration up front. They also\nmoved up Andy Jackson to play him centre forward,\nmidfield and centre half at the same time.\nThe Illrds fought back superbly, but were unable\nto find a way through the Birkbeck defence that had\nto resort to a lot of pushing, shirt pulling and sometimes knee high tackles to stop them. They were unable to score and the final score was 2\u20140 to Birkbeck\nIPs. It was not a brilliant game of football with both\nteams struggling to string more than two passes to-get her. Birkbeck deserved to win but IC were a bit\nunlucky not to score a goal.\nThe cup was presented to winning Birkbeck captain\nby Peter Mee, Registrar of the College and President\nof IC Football Club.\nThe small band of supporters made their way down\nthe road to the public bar of the Earl Beatty, to\nprepare themselves for the afternoons game when I C1st were due to extract revenge on Birkbeck 1st in their final ( IC won2 \u20140). The losing ll l rd made its\nway to the pub to celebrate reaching the final.\n(P.S. It's rumoured that a certain young lady is\nbanned from playing cards with the football club after\na somewhat flukey win at Stop the Bus when playing\nagainst vastly more experienced players).\nThe Ill rd team:\u2014\nM.

This\nwas the last match of a long series which has seen I.C. unbeaten since mid-November, and taken them to the\nleague and cup double\u2014not bad for a side that lost\nits first four games.\nArriving promptly at the ground (well it was a cup-final) the l sts were met with the bad news that the 3 rd\nteam had lost the upper reserves cup20 to Birkbeck\n2nd. The3 rd had ben unlucky to concede a deflected goal at a time when they were in complete command and they never really recovered from this.\nThe first few minutes of the U.L. Challenge cup\nfinal were typical cup football with all the players running hard and the ball oscillating from end to end with\ngreat frequency. Neither side was at ease on an unusually bumpy Motspur pitch but Birkbeck seemed to settle\ndown quicker than I.C. and their midfield were too\noften allowed room to pick the ball up on the halfway\nline and run at the I.C. defence. Several of these runs\nhad I.C. in trouble. I find it hard to recall why none\nof these early attacks produced shots on the I.C. goal.\nAsI.C. settled down the game became more even and\nBirkbeck were given a taste of things to come when\nMaurice Hastings drove a20 yard shot just over the\nbar.\nShortly after this a throw in on the right, produced\na muddle in the Birkbeck defence and gave Steve Bates\na chance to put I.C. ahead\u2014a chance which he took\nwith great certainty.\nAs so often before I.C. began to improve once they\nwere ahead. 1'he defence became much more stable\nand Birkbeck did not seem to know how to take advantage of the large Motspur pitch. The I.C. defence has\nnever been slow and Birkbecks long through were just\nnot accurate enough to tell. The I.C. midfield was looking good, but only going forward. When called upon to\nhelp defence they seemed lost in the middle of the pitch\nAs a consequence of this Birkbeck managed to get\nseveral long range shots at the I.C. goal. Only one\nof three was on target and Cerwyn Edwards did well\nto push this round the post.\nAt half-time a neutral observer would probably have\nsaid I.C. were lucky to be leading and he'd have been\nright. Birkbeck had played the better football (or more\nof it) and were only a goal down because the I.C. defence had kept them out and because the quality of\nImperial players in front of goal is such that they don't need to be asked twice to score. It was clear though\nthat I.C. would have to get the ball to their forwards\nmuch more often in the second half than they had in the first.\nBirkbeck put all they had into the first twenty minutes after the interval and the I.C. defence found the\ngoing hard. This time however, the midfield put their\nminds to helping the defence. The tackling of Pete\nLonnen and especially Steve Bates coupled with the astute passing of John Kelly soon threw Birkbeck back.\nBut I.C. could still not find their forwards with any\ngreat accuracy and the 1-0 lead looked very fragile\nwhen Birkbeck broke from defence.\nOn the touch line Steve Wells began to warm up and he would surely have come on had I.C. not scored\na second. A corner was half cleared and fan Bell\npushed a first-time ball through to Byron Smith whose\nhigh cross fell, a little fortunately, into the far corner\nof the goal. The goal itself was lucky but the initial\npass was a fine example of a football brain at work and\nthe difference between Birkbeck's keeper and ours was\nwell shown by his poor positioning.\nWith the result no longer in doubt the last few minutes lacked the atmosphere of the previous eighty.\nThis was I.C.'s third cup win in a row and shows just\nhow wrong people can be when they try to predict the\nfortunes of a team at the start of the season. The league trophy will also grace I.C.'s trophy cupboard\nthis year after absence of four seasons.\nCup Team: G. Edwards, R.K il,M. Manning, I. Bell,\nI. Postlethwaite, J. Kelly, P. Lonnen, S.

Black in the Union Office.\n\u00a9bt tu arp Imperial College Union peacefully passed away on\nTuesday, 7th March,1973 at 5 p.m. through complete\nlack of interest, mourned by many old friends. The wake will be on Wednesday, 21st March in the Union Bar( after the Rugby Club Dinner).\nThe functions of IC Union have been taken over by\nthe Communist Party.\nBADMINTON\nWith the season almost over and the courts tending\nto cut up rather easily, the 3rd team voted to take a well deserved respite from the tensions of the league\ntitle race and conceded a critical match by arranging\na fixture with Kings but not telling them about it.\nTalks of a team holiday in Majorca originated at\nabout this time but it was estimated that funds would\njust about pay for the refreshment before the journey\nso this idea was discontinued. Instead, the Ill rds were\nleft to face the intense challenge of no match for a fortnight. Meanwhile the IVths had shot to the top of\ntheir league by winning all their matches by default\nand the 1st team squad (pronounced: morons) had been depleted by introducing aMr. George who into\ntheir midst so soon after his strap adic to my operation.\nThe seconds, too had not been idle\u2014using their time\nto consolidate their lead as 2nd in division one due\nto a series of accidents when they won several matches.\nWith Chris Atkinson in such fine form this season not\nto mention the others in the 2nd team because they'll\ntake up too much space it's only the splendid work of\nChris Forkdodger in the l sts that is keeping them in1 st place above the 2nds( that's worth a pint isn't it,\nChris?).\nBeside's the UL U matches, IC Ists beat Cambridge\nCockerals each year and this year was no exception,\nbut apart from this the members of the badminton\nclub are quite nice really\u2014especially Rho d( Ooh, what\na give-away!!).\nOn Thursday last, the badminton club annihilated\nthe boat club at darts by P games to q where P is greater than q but they forgot to buy our drinks and didn't want a boat race in the Union Bar. A real boat race on\nthe Thames was discussed though.\nThe final team placings for the end of the season\nseem almost certainly to be:\u2014l sts captained by Dave\nWard;1s tin division 1. 2nds not captained by Chris\nAtkinson; 3rd in division 1, 3rds not captained; 2nd in division 2. 4th s captained by Maurice Flanagan; 2nd in division 3. 1st mixed team, both 1st in divisions 1\nand 2 respectively. 2nd mixed team, both 1st in divisions 1 and 2 respectively.\nFor the 2nd consecutive year I.C.l sts are through\nto the final of the UL U Badminton cup and are, in\nfact, favourites to win.\nAlso, the Ists have won their league for the fourth\nconsecutive year losing only one match\u2014in 1971. The mixed team, however, have slumped alarmingly recently and crashed to their first defeat in2 years when\nthey lost 7-2 to UL \u2014 this however does not affect the\nleague placings.\nKEITH THOMPSON, Met. II.\nBLUEBEARD\n'Bluebeard' ( X) Continentale, Tottenham Court Rd. Richard Burton, Raquel Welch et. al. The other day I had the unfortunate experience of\nseeing this film at a press showing, in the company of\nour Daily Newspaper critics. It is hardly surprising that\nso many damning film reviews are churned out nowadays\u2014the audiences at press shows are so bored. It is\nmost embarrassing to be creased up with laughter at\na funny bit only to look round at Ian Christie ('Ex-press') and friends looking on in stony silence.\nBut I did enjoy this film\u2014a nice Monday morning\nescapist film.'It is about a German count nicknamed\nBluebeard because his beard is that colour due to a flying accident in World War One. His speciality is\naccumulating one gorgeous lady after another, then\ndoing away with them in various interesting ways. He shoots one, guillotines another, drowns yet another in red wine, etc.\u2014the list is almost endless. Since he is a hunting man he also has to keep his trophies in his\nfamily deep-freeze deep in his Schloss. Eventually his\nlatest wife discovers them, so he puts her in as well\n(alive), but not before he tells all about his previous\nloves. Hence the film.\nThe plot isn't up to much\u2014nor the acting; except\nfor a few character parts (Raquel Welch as a nun, for\nexample). But we are supposed not to notice all that\ncircumstantial rubbish, bombarded as we are by one\nlovely lady after another in varying degrees of undress.\nI must admit I was overcome (so was Ian Christie!);\neven so, it is meant to be a comedy (not that I can expect anyone to take it seriously) and there are some\nwitty bits\u2014like one over-affectionate wife who insists\non making him choose between her breasts \" Cinnamon\" and \" Jasmin\", half suffocating him in the process. But in the end we discover just why Bluebeard does kill all these nice wenches, and I must stress that this reason\nis a problem that affects all men alive today.\nYours seriously,\nSERGEI. ALL FINGS FOUL\nAND FUNDERFUL\nAll Things Bright and Beautiful ( A A). ABC Union Concert Hall, Last Tues., Wed., Thurs.\nJust what was the Felix film critic doing at an I.C. play, you may ask, when about 3,500 people didn't bother? He went there because he knew a few people in\nit, who were very insistent about selling him a ticket or\ntwo (perhaps if I had been the Theatre Critic, I might\nhave got in free).\nWell, the play was a Northern comedy, full of northern humour (he said in his best home counties accent)\nwhich was not lost on the very receptive audience, who\npresumably were all friends of the cast, persuaded to\ncome along and see Mike or Denny, and pay 25p for\nthe pleasure. Still, the cast, conditioned to audiences\nof 50 or so, by Thursday were naturally apprehensive,\nuntil they realised how nice the audience was, when\nthey warmed up. The play is as much about Rory, the\nson, (who is never seen\u2014only heard) as about any-one. Central in the plot is a stolen lectern in the form\nof a large eagle, which is an allegory 1 suppose of ' All things Bright and Beautiful', the things the Hesseltine\nfamily has never had. They live in a slum and are soon\nto be rehoused, which supposedly will solve all problems, especially for 'Queenie' (Mrs. Hesseltine), who like\nthe rest is 'Waiting for Godot'. (That was the only\ntheatre-critic clich e1 can remember.) However, everything seems to go wrong. They are allocated a flat\nmiles out of town not a house close by as they expected,\nand this, with the broken, half painted eagle supposedly\nrepresents their dead-ended existence. Very sad. Very,\nvery sad.\nI.C. acting contrives to amaze me. As usual some\npeople are better than others, but none very bad. I liked\nPenny Pike's stand-of fish ness, Mike Stranger's bearded\ndogmatic dominant Hesseltine senior, and Carina as\nQueenie or was it Queenie as Carina?\u2014she was very\nrealistic, perhaps too realistic. Steve Groves did a nice\ncameo role at the end and seemed to enjoy it. In fact\nI think all the cast enjoyed themselves\u2014enough said. If\nthe cast enjoyed it and so did the audience, who amI to criticise the artistic content (which was not lacking)?\nMIKE' SERGEI' SOUTH ON. "
