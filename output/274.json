We\nwould also like to apologise\nto Les Ebdon for suggesting\nthat he was either shouted\ndown or did not know what\nhe was talking about.\nO.S.A. Dance\nOn 14th March the Overseas Students Committee is\nholding an International\nDinner and Dance. This will\ninclude an Indian Curry\nDinner, a cabaret featuring\nChinese sword dances and\nGreek bou zo uki songs and a Jazz Band. An exhibition of\nfolk art from various countries will form the decoration\nand National costume or\nevening dress is to be worn if\npossible.\nANDREWS photographic\nSpecial concessions\nfor students for\nphotographic materials\nand equipment\n13 THE ARCADE\nS.

Sleepy residents of 43 and\n44 Evelyn Gardens \u2014 the\nlatest student house to be\noccupied \u2014 had to make a speedy eva cul ation when fire\nbroke out al 5 a.m. on the\nmorning of Monday, Jan.\n24th. Among those who\nraced to the street was Steve\nff as let t, who had just moved\nin after his Southside room\nwas also fire damaged.\nAt Bernard Sunley House,\na small fire broke out in\nhouse 44 under the floorboards of a ii rst floor landing serving 4 rooms, and this\nhouse and parts of 43 were\nsoon filled with a dense acrid\nsmoke. After a999 call, three\nfire appliances arrived. Some\nstudents, awakened by the\nnoise, started knocking up\nthe others, and they were\njoined by firemen. In the\napparent absence of an alarm\nsystem, most residents were\nunaware of the danger until\n10. to 15 minutes after the\nfire was discovered.\nDamage caused by the fire\nwas small, as it did not have\ntime to get a hold. A small\nhole burnt through the floor\nhad to be rather enlarged by\nfiremen in extinguishing the\noutbreak. The landing was\nbarricaded off and the residents housed elsewhere.\nTraces of acrid smoke remained for several days.\nThe fire was caused by an\nelectrical fault, though no\nofficial announcement has\nbeen made as to the exact\ncause or whether it could\nhappen again. Some residents\nhave complained about fire\nprecautions in general in the\nStudent Houses. Electrical\nfaults could arise from the\noverloading of ring mains by\nthe use of unauthorised electric fires in place of the\nallegedly inefficient and expensive heaters installed. The\nwallpaper behind some of the\nstorage heaters on the landings is badly charred, and fire\nescapes are inadequate (in-clu ding barred basement\nwindows). Most serious of all\nis the apparent lack of alarms\nor fire escape procedure.\nAt least there were bells to\nring in Southside when electrical equipment in room 647\nburst into flames on the previous Sunday dinner time and\nset the curtains alight.\nAlthough the resident was\naway, a friend had the key\nand the door had been left\nunlocked, so the fire was\nspeedily dealt with. Burning\nbedding was thrown out of\nthe window by the fire-fighters, who included Mr.\nSeaford, and most of Falmouth gallery level was soon\ncovered in feathers. With a badly charred window-frame,\nthe room will be out of\naction for about 4 weeks.\nR. C.S.U. nominations Hustings for the election of\nnext year's RCS President\nwere held on Tuesday, and\na full report is in Felicity. At\nthe time of going to press,\nthere were two firm candidates for the presidency \u2014\nChris Kent and John Butterworth. .The former, from\nMaths 2, is at present\nR. C.S.U. Rep on Council\nand also helps on many other\ncommittees, while \"Butty\"\nchairs the RCS ents commit-tee, responsible for the RCS\nCarnival Smoking Concert,\netc.\nTwo candidates have\nemerged for the Vice-President. The better known is\nSteve Morrisby, who has successfully defended Theta for\nthe past few months. The\nother is Barry Pywell, an\nemanation from Physics 2,\nwho may be seen playing\nscrabble outside the lifts on\nlevel 3 on a fine day.\nPenny Walters, who has\ndone much valuable work as\nAssistant Secretary, is unopposed for the post of Secretary. Although nominations\nhad closed by Felix press\ndate, the exact number of\ncandidates is uncertain, as\nseveral sets of nomination\npapers were stolen from\nnotice-boards.\nThe R. C.S.U. elections will\nbe held on Monday the 10th of March.\nDramsoc again\nThe Dramatic Society's production for this term will\nbe \"The Two Gentlemen of\nVerona\". This little known\nplay by William Shakespeare\nis the first of his works to be\nperformed by the Society for\nmore than a decade. For\nsome years, the Dramatic\nSociety has attempted to produce one popular and one\nmodern play a year, to cater\nfor a wide cross-section of\ninterests. Last term's play\nwas of the modern school,\nthis term's should appeal to\nlovers of traditional drama.\n\"Shakespeare\" is often thought to be for culture vultures only, but we believe\nthat this image has developed\nfrom abysmally bad school\nplays and \"O\" level English\nLiterature; well performed,\nhis plays provide a range of\ndramatic spectacle ranging\nfrom the thrilling to the\nfrothy. If past standards are\nmaintained, this production\ncan only be good and an\nenjoyable evening is guaranteed for one and all.\nJOE COCKER AND THE BONZO DOG The second concert in aid\nof the ailing carnival charity\nfunds was not the disaster the\nfirst had been. All the expected groups turned up but\nthe hoped for audience was\nscattered thinly around the\ncircumference of the vast\nAlbert Hall dome,\nJohn Peel did his best to\nhold the show together when\nfaced with long intervals\nwhilst Spooky Tooth and the\nBonzo Dog set up all their\nTEACHING\nAND\nLEARNING\nThe Teaching and Learning Methods Conference will\ntake place on Friday 21st and\nSaturday 22nd March.

Complete\nprogramme details will be\nposted around the Union in\nthe next week. About 40-50\nstudents can attend with at\nleast one from each department (Postgraduates are\nwelcome).\nAnyone interested in attending should drop a note\nin the Union Office addressed\nto Rex Lowin or Dave Wield.\nequipment, but while both\nthese put on excellent per-form ances, the night surely\nbelonged to Joe Cocker and\nthe Grease Band, who started\nrather badly but had changed\nthe whole atmosphere of the\nconcert by the end of their\nact.\nThey did this with a mixture of pure energy and a selection of well chosen contrasting songs, which gradually succeeded in bringing the\naudience over to their side.\nFortunately, the Smile, who\nopened the show after the\ninterval were original enough\nin their choice of style and\nmaterial to be entertaining\nafter Joe's act, but the Bonzo\nDog were partly spoilt by distorted amplification making\na lot of their comedy unintelligible to the majority\nnear the back of the hall.\nNevertheless the only other\ncomplaint that could be made\nagainst the act was the shortage of actual songs and the\nproliferation of explosions,\nand they must surely be\nunique amongst other socalled pop groups.\nThe show overran for half\nan hour, and the Bonzo Dog\nBand decided to donate \u00a360\nto cover this, for which we\nmust be grateful, and it is\nonly sad that more people\ncould not turn out to go\nalong and see the concert.\nAlthough not the financial\ncatastrophe of the Spencer\nDavis concert magnitude, a loss of between \u00a3100 and \u00a3500\nwas made on this concert.\nYou don't have to be an ICWArian to go to the\nICWA FORMAL\n(The best \" D.J.

    "content": "Page 2 FELIX 6th March, 1969\nReferendum voters say;\nWe want to elect our\nUnion Officials\nThe referendum held\non Monday 24th produced 1742 students willing to give their views\non the constitution and\napprove or disapprove\nof suggested changes.\nGenerally, they wanted\nthings as they are, with\nthe notable exceptions\nof heavy majorities in\nfavour of the president\nand secretary being elected by a vote throughout\nthe college, and for departmental reps, being\non council.\nAs stated in the last\nFELIX, a Union meeting was\nheld the Thursday before to\ndiscuss the referendum, but\ndue to bad publicity only 40\npeople came, so it was cancelled as being of little use in\ninforming the general student\nbody.\nDespite receiving a favourable vote, the proposed Sabbatical year of the President\nwill not be included in constitutional amendments as set\nout by the working party, but\nwill be treated as a separate\nsuggestion to the college\nadministration.\nThe recommended new\nconstitution was due to be\npresented to council on Monday 3rd March, and will subsequently have to be passed\nthrough two successive Union\nmeetings with a two-thirds\nmajority.\nThe chairman of the working party on the constitution,\nMartin Bland, seemed satisfied with the reaction to the\nreferendum, but considered\nthat some of the questions\nhad been badly phrased and\nshould have been more\ndirectly emphasised; in particular he thought that the\nquestion on 1CW A should\nhave been phrased relative to\nICWA's elevated status as a comparatively small IC club,\nrather than the vague \"Do\nyou believe \"\nNot many postgraduates\nvoted, surprisingly, but the\nvoting was not random, as\nthe results show, although a publication of the voting held\nin the RSM showed a reversal\non the Sabbatical year result.\nIn a letter to FELIX, unfortunately unpublished due\nto space reasons, George Assimakis referred to rumours\nthat \"certain members of\ncouncil tried to boycott the\nreferendum by asking people-not to vote\"; he also claims\nthat certain year reps, refused\nto announce the referendum\nto their years and failed to\nhelp in manning the ballot\nboxes, resulting in some years\nvoting almost completely and\nothers hardly at all.\nIn all, however, the referendum has shown that the\nstudents here are not as apathetic as some would like to\nthink, and that they want a much more democratic and\nrepresentative structure in\nICU. Certainly, the most important result of the referendum has been the overwhelming majority in favour of reform in the president and\nsecretary's election system.\nConstitutional Final\nreferendum results\nThe 1742 people who took part in the referendum voted as follows:\nDo you believe that Yes No Abst.\nConstituent colleges should exist ? 1221 491 30\nICWA should exist ? 976 727 39\nExec, should exist ? 1243 434 65\nICU should join NUS ? 781 922 39\nPresident should have Sabbatical year ? 968 708 66\nPresident and Secretary should be elected\nby a vote throughout the college ? 1322 396 24\nDepartmental reps, should be on council ? 1064 603 75\nSeven Vice-Presidents for I.C.U. Proposals submitted to\nICU Council by the constitutional reform working party\nare reformist rather than\nrevolutionary. Seven VicePresidents are suggested, the\nadditions being Welfare, External Affairs, Academic and\nInternal Affairs (instead of\nthe present Deputy President). Three types of UGM\nare recommended, including\none without a quorum but\nwith stipulated publicity\nregulations.\nThe size of Council would\nbe considerably increased to\n37 by including eleven departmental reps. President,\nSecretary and departmental\nreps would be elected by\ngeneral ballot and most of\nthe other Union Officers from\nthe floor of the Union AGM.\nThe party have recommended Council have more\nmajor sub-committees\u2014welfare, external affairs, aca-demi c, house and finance\nbeside the clubs committees.\nHowever they have not made\nrecommendations on NUS,\n1CW A or the constituent colleges on the grounds that it\nwas not their business. The\nExecutive stays, slightly modernised but due to lack of\ntime no recommendation,\nother than that of further\nstudy, has been made on the\nquestion of a Sabbatical year\nfor the President.\nadventure holidays in Iceland\nnature'sw mt der land MAKE CAMP IN ICELAND THIS SUMMER\nFLY FROM GLASGOW FOR AS LITTLE AS \u00a335\"7\"0NIGHT TOURIST RETURN\n(GROUP DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE]\n1\n6\n1 Piccadilly LONDON WW ONR\nTel: HYDepark 7661\n33 St. Enoch Square, GLASGOW C.1.

Carnival raves\nto Chickenshack\nLast Friday night and Saturday morning, the RCS\nTime Machine turned on\nabout 500 people, just as the\nadverts claimed. Such was\nthe enthusiasm generated by\nthe audience that both of the\nstar attractions, Chickenshack and The Barrow Poets\noverran their time by a considerable amount at no extra\ncharge to the organisers.\nChairman of RCS Ents, John\n\"Butty\" Butterworth, claimed\nthat more stayed through the\nnight for their early morning\nsoup than ever had done be-fore. The loss on the event is\nbelieved to be in the region\nof \u00a3100, not an over large sum\nfor such superb entertain-ment.\n'At home'\nThe Tizard Hall \" At Home \"' was held last Tuesday to enable residents to\nmeet their tutors in the more\nsocial atmosphere of Tizard\ngallery. Punch and wine were\nserved and plates of biscuits\nand nuts were periodically\nreplenished and passed round\namd ng the residents and their\nguests'.\nUnfortunately, few students\ntook advantage of the\noccasion to bring their tutors\nor other representatives of\ntheir departments, and the\nmajority just came to drink\nwhat they, would have to pay\nfor anyway. The punch was\ndisappointingly weak, but\nthis was compensated for by\nthe wine.\nThe evening lasted from 6\ntill eight and the drink lasted\nremarkably well, so the\nevening was enjoyed by all.\nPublicity stunt\ngoes astray\nIn the early hours of Tuesday morning a week ago two\ngeology I students could have\nbeen sitting on the top of the\nwall of Wandsworth Prison\nfor 1| hours. The idea was to\nbreak in, put up Carnival\nposters and break out again.\nBut surveying the patrolling\nwarders and loose police dogs\nthey decided to just sit on the\nwall. One person rang up the\nMirror for publicity and the\nsin-in was then terminated\nby the arrival of the police.\nFour people spent the night\nin jail but were released midday Tuesday after making\nstatements.\nCorr's footnote\nOn seeing this week's 'They Tell Me', Dermott Corr\nwished to comment \"Who\ntold him that?\"\nt "

IC attacked\nstrongly in the opening minutes and were unlucky not\nto go into the lead when J. Nicol hit the post following\na good move. This one piece\nof bad luck seemed to deter\nthe 2nd XI and UC were allowed to come more into the\ngame and opened the scoring\nwith a speculative shot for\nwhich the IC goalkeeper\nwas un sighted. UC's second\ngoal came shortly afterwards\nwhen a defensive error allowed the centre-forward to\nscore an easy goal.\nThe second half continued\nin much the same way with\nIC having as much of the\nplay as UC but not looking\nlike scoring. The break came\nwhen Nicol won the ball in\na bounce-up and short first\ntime into the net. Five minutes later R.J. Horlock,\nheavily disguised as a2nd XI\nplayer, broke through on the\nright to equalise. IC were\nnow in a commanding position and it was no surprise\nwhen A. Richards headed a third goal with the UC defence completely out of pos i tion. With only five minutes\nleft to play and IC still in\na commanding position they\nlooked set for a place in the\nfinal for the second year\nrunning. However, UC continued to attack and following a half-cleared corner.the\nwing half shot through a crowd of players to equalise.\nThe score at full-time was\n3-3 and it was decided to\nplay extra time, despite the\nheavy conditions. After\nabout 10 minutes UC went\nahead when an IC defender\nwas caught in possession just\noutside the box. IC continued to fight back and deservedly equalise d when Nicol\nscored his second goal. In\nthe second half of extra time\nthe play was end-to-end and\nwith both sides tiring it was\nobvious that the next goal\nwould be the winner. It went\nto UC when one of their tall\ndefenders rose above the IC\ndefence to head a good goal.\nLadies\nSwim\nWin\nOn Friday, 21st February,\nin the first match in the University of London Swimming\nLeague at our own pool, the\nladies swimming team beat\nQEC by 33 points to 23. In\nspite of having one excellent swimmer QEC found\nthe all-round strength of IC\ntoo much for them.\nThe medley relay was the\nmost exciting race, QEC taking a5 yard lead on the\nfirst leg only to find themselves trailing by two yards\nafter a good breast-stroke\nleg by Linda Allan-Rowlanson. This lead was maintained by Jacquie Boardman\nto give IC a good win.\nTeam: T. Brown, J. Maycock, L. Allan-Rowlanson,\nL. Campion, J. Boardman,\nE. Bowker.\nJoyce M. Maycock.\nReading\nRegatta\nThe regatta at Reading\nmentioned in the last issue\nof FELIX did not go as well\nas hoped, the first crew being defeated by 2 lengths in\ntheir second race. In the second VIIIs event our crew\nwon through to the final\nwhere they met Reading\nUniversity. Reading led by\n\\ length after the start and\nincreased this to f length\nafter two minutes. However,\nthe IC crew began to close\nup and at the finish spurted\nhard and were unlucky to\nlose by 2ft. Both the Cambridge and\nOxford university crews were\npractising on the Tideway\nthe other weekend and\nthough Cambridge appear\nneater in their blade work Oxford seem to have much\npower available.\nG,W. Harrison.\nICWA trounced in\nUL hockey final\nUC 5 IC 1\nThis year's final of the\nUL Ladies Hockey Cup was\na complete reversal of last\nyear's in which IC beat UC.\niC WA's main fault was\ntheir lack of co-ordination\nand teamwork which was\ndemonstrated disastrously in\nthe first ten minutes of the\nmatch\u2014the ball was in the\nIC half practically all the\ntime and UC took advantage\nof this to score two good\ngoals. IC's play improved\nafter this and the match\nevened out. The score was\n2-nil to UC at half time but\nIC looked as if they could\nmake a comeback. Indeed\nsoon after the second half\nIC scored but the goal that\nreally stopped IC followed\nfive minutes later when the\nwhole of the IC defence\nwatched the UC centre forward slam the ball into the\nnet from a corner. UC were\nthen spurred on to mount a concentrated attack to which\nIC had no reply and they\nproceeded to score two more\ngoals giving the final score\n5-1.\nThe ISWA team had not\nplayed for a month due to\nthe weather but their main\ndownfall was the total lack\nof teamwork, and if they are\nto become UL champions\nagain ICWA must learn that\nthe sheer determination that\nhas carried them through in\nthe past cannot replace good\nteamwork as a match win-ner.\nTen Pin Bowlers all at\n600's and 700's Since the last report in\nFELIX the club has had\nseveral matches with a fair\namount of success. In the\nNational Universities League\nthere have been only three\nmatches due to an unfortunate cancellation which\nthe opposition claimed as a walkover.\nThe most recent match\nwas against Bath University.\nThis produced by far the\nmost satisfying match of the\nwhole season\u2014a fitting end\nto the season in the league.\nThe 1st team for once hit\nform together, which produced their highest game\nand series of the session.\nIn particular Trevor Longman broke all the College\nindividual records when he\nbowled a237 game and 610\nseries (173, 237, 200) \u2014 a fantastic achievement. He was\nthe first bowler in the College ever to break the 600\nbarrier. The 1st team therefore won 4-0, but unfortunately the 3rds lost 0-4.\nTrevor Longman's record\nwas short-lived. Last Wednesday Dave Foster bowled\nan even more fantastic 720\nseries (219, 223, 278). The\nbest game included 9 consecutive strikes. This not\nonly beats anything else\ndone at IC, but also beats\nthe ABC Acton's house record of 709.\nOn 1st February the club\nentered two teams in a12 hour marathon bowling competition at Birmingham attended by about 30 university clubs from all parts of\nthe country. The object was\nfor each team to accumulate\nas high a pin-fall as possible\nover the twelve hours. The\ncompetition was won by\nSouthampton University with\na pin-fall of over 18,000,\nwith our 1st team ending in\na pleasing 8th position with\na pinfall of over 16,000.\nFierce struggle for 1st XV National Westminster Bank\nA week ago yesterday, I.C. rugby firsts were honoured\nby being the first team to\nplay against the newly\nformed National Westminster Bank first team. An unusually large crowd, including the Rector and Secretary\nof IC and Mines Hon. Pornographer, braved the bitterly\ncold conditions to cheer IC\non to what was nearly an\nunexpected victory.\nThe game began at half-pace, the Bank looking distinctly disjointed and IC\ndistinctly hungover, but soon\ncame to the boil. A scrum\ninfringement just outside the\nIC 25 gave the bank a3 pt.\nlead with a very well taken\npenalty. This lead was very\nshort lived as IC replied with\na remarkable try. Having\nwon a good loose ball outside their own 25, Dave Bell\nhandled at speed, the ball\nreaching Roy Anderson via\nNoddy Connolly. Roy, seeing\nJ. Smithies was not feeling\ntoo strong, threw a long pass\nout to Martin Tomlinson who\npassed his opposite number\nwith great ease, kicked\nahead and with John Smith9 pts. IC Ist XV 5 pts.\nies following up fast to hack\nthe ball on, Martin Tomlinson crossed the line to score.\nDave Bell kicked a good\nconversion. Just before half\ntime the Bank scored a scrappy try.\nHalf time passed with\nJohnny Walker all round\n(spectators only), thanks to\na kind-hearted and now penniless Bank Manager. The\nexcitement in the second half\nwas so great that most spectators departed to the bar for\nanother drink.\nThe second half developed\ninto a fierce struggle \u2014 IC\nhaving the better of the play\nbut, as has been so common\nthis season, not being able to\nturn their advantage into a score. A dropped goal completed the scoring for the\nBank.\nIn the U.L.7 a side competition on Saturday the 2nd VII were beaten 10-8 in the\nfirst round by R.H. C. and\nthe first VII went down 9-8\nto U.C. in the next round\nhaving beaten Wye College\nfirst VII, 13-0.\n4th win for\nJezette\nThe now perennial pedal\ncar race was held last weekend in Bristol. The race was\nrun this year (efficiently and\nprofitably) by five second\nyear engineers from Bristol,\nwho under tok the organization after the rag committee\nrefused due to the loss incurred last year.\nTwo teams from RCS and\none from Guilds were\nentered. All of the cars when\nrunning performed quite\nwell\u2014'Bo', the Guilds' car,\nhaving a little initial trouble\nwith their drive chain.\n'Jezette IF, now in its fourth\nyear, scored its four and possibly most massive win; it\nwas over two hours ahead of\nits nearest rival at the end\nof the race. 'Big Jez', the\nsecond RCS car, was running\nfairly consistently, though\nslowly, throughout the race.\nI would like to congratulate the people who pedalled\nthe winning Jezette, and the\nmembers of Guilds' and Big\nJez's teams for their gallant\nefforts, and to tank all those\nwho came down to Bristol\nto run the pits.

The question to be asked, and subsequently answered, is where the failings lie and what can\nbe done to correct them.\nThe reasons given by the Carnival co-or d in at or for the\nfailure are three-fold: a lack of experience, time and people.\nTaking the final point first, the suggestion that not enough\npeople expressed a willingness to work for carnival is surely\nborne out by the fact that one person alone was responsible\nfor running the concert, and only three were available to run\nthe discotheque at which the Carnival Queen was elected.\nThe fact that insufficient numbers joined Carnival meant\nthat the committee did not have enough time to arrange\nthings as they would have wished, the result being the almost\ncomplete failure of the whole of Carnival Week.\nThe remedy for both the shortage of time and people\nwould surely be to hold the elections for Carnival co-or d in at or and decide the charity at the end of the previous ses-sion, instead of the beginning of the Autumn term. The election of the Carnival coordinator and the filling of all major\nposts on Carnival at this time would give those elected\na chance to work out plans for Carnival over the summer\nvacation and the choice of charity at the same time would\nmean that raffle tickets and the relevant posters could be\nprepared ready for immediate use at the beginning of the\nnew session. Arriving back at the beginning of term with all\nthe ground work laid, the committee would them be in a position of being able to concentrate completely on creating\ninterest in Carnival (a position the present committee were\nnever allowed to enjoy).\nUnder the present system, all those people who are willing\nto work in any capacity in the Union take posts at the club\nand Union A.G.M.' s held at the end of the academic year,\nand thus by the time Carnival is appealing for committee\nmembers they are firmly entrenched in the various clubs, and\nperhaps more importantly for them in Hall. The remaining\nfailing to be overcome next year is that of the lack of experience which exists in this year's committee. There must be\nmore continuity between the Carnival committee of this year\nand that of next. Since a number of this year's committee\nhave expressed a willingness to carry on in some capacity\nnext year, this is the ideal time to bring the elections forward\nand ensure this continuity. As the success or failure of Carnival respectively adds to or detracts from the prestige of the\nI.C.U., we must do all in our power to make next year's Carnival less of a failure than this has been.\nAt Imperial College London SW7 (01-589 2963) will be\nfound: Editor Paul Heath Assistant Editor Mary Ford\nNews Ian Carr Features Malcolm (ego-trip) Williamson\nSport Bob Pine Felicity John Probst Business Tony Kirkham Advertising Pete Chapman Phil Rainey Circulation\nDave Chant Cover Alan Cumimings Photographies John\nRogers John Langley Robin Gostick What's on Andrew\nHolman Other Invaluable Contributors Les Ebdon Piers\nCortbyn Ian Quarrinton Frances Campbell Geoff Craig\nMartin Bland Caroline Patsy and all our superb sales girls\nNational Advertising J.

Also, the\nopinions represented in these\nletters are not necessarily the\nopinions of Felix.\nSTAFF-STUDENTS\n\"STERILE TO IMPROVEMENT\"\nSir,\nAs a member of a staff-student committee, I should\nlike to reply to the letter of\nMr. D. Christopher concerning student participation in\nuniversity policy. He bemoans the fact that these\ncommittees discuss matters in\na reasonable manner. Perhaps\nhe would like to explain what\ncan be achieved through\nbeing unreasonable. The\nquestion \"what if both sides\nreason differently?\" is totally\nirrelevant and symptomatic\nof the attitude expressed by\nP. Corbyn and others of \"us\nthe students against them the\nstaff\". This attitude is extremely naive and completely\nsterile towards improvement;\nit merely serves to undermine\nthe existing staff - student\nrelations.\nThe aim of staff-student\ncommittees has been, since\ntheir birth two years ago, to\nestablish an atmosphere in\nwhich all parties concerned\ncan meet and discuss matters\nrelevant to their needs. Considerable progress in this\nrespect has been achieved in\nIthe Physics department. A number of recommendations\nby the committee have been\nimplemented and several new\nideas brought up by the\nstudents have been in direct\nparallel to those brought up\nby the staff. A staff working\nparty has been set up to reexamine the whole purpose of\nphysics education and the\nstaff will, of their own\ninitiative, consult student\nopinion.\nThis degree of co-operation\nand understanding has not\nbeen attained by taking over\nthe senior tutor's office and\nsinging \"We shall overcome\".\nNeither has it been attained\nby presenting the staff with\na series of ultimatums. It\ngoes without saying that\nstudents will only be given\nparticipation in university\npolicy when they show themselves sufficiently responsible\nto bear the task.\nA level of confidence must\nexist between staff and students before major changes\ninstigated at staff - student\ncommittees can be brought\nabout. Instead of casting\nR.C.S. DINNER\nSir,\nWe would like to dispel the\nrumour (as reported in the\nlast FELIX) that people\napplying for the RCS annual\ndinner now would be unlikely\nto be allocated tickets.\nIn fact, our policy will be\nto allocate tickets on a \"ran-dom sample\" basis, all applications received before 7th March having a chance. So\nif anyone is interested, we\nwould urge them to fill in a form and send it in im-mediate ly.C. J. L. Yewlett,\nHon. Sec. RCSU.\naspersions on staff-student\nrelations, Messrs. Corbyn,\nChristopher and Co. would\nbe far better employed in\nbuilding up this level of con-fide n ce. Brian Hains,\n(3rd Year rep. Physics\nstaff-student committee)\nTHE REDS ARE COMING\nSir,\nRecently, the matter of\nvandalism at LSE has received a good deal of attention in the columns of FELIX\nfrom our socialist sob-sisters at IC. Generally speaking they have put forward\nthe view that their comrades\nat LSE are really good guys\nand gals being oppressed by\nFascist authorities and the\npolice. I suggest, sir, that this\nis not the case.\nThe gates at LSE were put\nup by Dr. Adams (quite\nrightly in my opinion) to stop\nfurther illegal occupations of\nthe school by Communist\ntraitors. Some of the LSE\nstudents then saw fit to tear\nthem down and as LSE is not\ntheir property anyway they\nhad no right to do this.\nLike Mr. Duckett (or\n\"Spukes\" as he is known) I attended one of the UL U meetings and saw there (with\nno particular surprise) the\nusual motley selection of Red\nagitators, like the well-known\npro-Chinese Communist, Mr.\nManohada. Unfortunately I had to leave when the atmosphere became almost toxic.\nI sincerely hope that\nstudents at IC realise that we\nhave rights of free-speech in\nthis country which are virtually unparalleled anywhere\nin the world except perhaps\nin the USA.\nWe must make sure that\nthese rights are not abused\nby a minority of Reds trying\nto impose their views upon\nall and sundry by encouraging Right - Wing patriotic\nstudents to attend all student\nmeetings and fight Communism on the debating floor.\nLastly, I agree with John\nWayne: \"f... Communism\".\nDavid J. Hidson,\nPhysics 3.\nEngineers\nScientists:\nPatent\nOffice\nLondon\nFind out first-hand\nwhat life is like as a Patent Examiner\nYou would be surprised to learn how interesting\na career as a Patent Examiner can be. Accept this\ninvitation to visit us at the Patent Office and find out\nall about it first-hand.\nBasically the job of the Patent Examiner is to vet\napplications for the patenting of new ideas in electrical,\nmechanical, chemical and other fields.\nWhen you join you are assigned to a senior\nExaminer who will start you off on the less complicated\nspecifications, to give you the chance to grasp the\nmechanics of the task. As your aptitude develops so\nyou will be given more and more demanding work\nand with less and less supervision, until eventually you\nwork entirely on your own.\nMake no mistake about it, to meet the challenge\nwhich this kind of work involves, you need an enquiring\nmind and the ability to develop your critical and\nanalytical faculties to the highest degree. And you have\nto be prepared to argue your case with the applicant\nor his professional advisers.\nYou will earn an excellent salary, starting at \u00a31,146\nand reaching \u00a31,927 after 3-5 years. Virtually all\nexaminers reach senior grade, salary up to \u00a33,975.\nThis grade can be reached in 9-10 years. Holidays are\nsignificantly better than you could expect in industry.\nNon-contributory pension.\nNow you have an outline idea of the job.\nIf you would like to find out more, please write to\nMr. C. L.B. Smith, The Patent Office, 25 Southampton\nBuildings, London, W.C.2. He will send you full\ndetails, and you can then arrange a day to visit the\nPatent Office.\n$Z You must have or expect to obtain a First or Second Class\nHonours degree in engineering, physics, chemistry, or mathematics,\nor an equivalent qualification, such as Corporate membership of\nthe I.

    "content": "6th March, 1969 FELIX Page 5\nThe function of the University\nFollowing the large expansion in the last decade of the numbers of students attending University, the present structure of our universiti e criticised from many angles. At one extreme is the group of academics who suggest the idea of a University completely independent of the\nment, at the other are the students of the left who feel that industry already controls our courses.\nTo discuss the whole problem of the function of the University, in the light of the present situation, Felix has invited a number of pe op l contribute articles on the subject. In this issue Matthew Duncan-Jones suggests ways of improving Imperial College, and Matthew Carring\nsuggests solutions to problems facing universities in general.\nWhat is Imperial College anyway? by Matthew Duncan-Jones\n\" Crap \", \" a mind-sausage machine \" are commonplace\nanswers among students here and elsewhere to the question\nstated in the title. This open failure on the part of the institution can be simply and correctly analysed. IC is the most\nglorified college of technology in Britain and as a tech. of\ncourse has no Arts or Social Science faculties. This means\nthat the ratio of men to women is very out of balance and\nthat the students are more narrowly educated than elsewhere.\nThe techniques of criticism and understanding of anything\nnot involving mathematics remain abysmally low from\nbeginning to end of College life. IC's lack of creativity is\npartly demonstrated by the fact that the new informal arts\nsociety \" Henry \" finds it very difficult to get off the ground\nand also by the shortage of material of any standard for\nFELIX and PHOENIX. Social life very often centres on the\nbar. Women aren't allowed in the Union Bar and conversely\nwith the ICWA lounge. A motion calling for an end to this\nridiculous state of affairs was recently rejected by ICU,\nmuch to the derision of the RCA.\nManifestations of the immaturity of the structures of IC\nare many and obvious: Morphy day (from which RCSU\nhas at last withdrawn), the President's Ball, and pots presented to few and sundry, the dinosaur nature of the Union\nand the childish use of standing orders at Union meetings.\nAnother is the Joint Committee of the Union, the Rector\nand the Governors (JURGO), Jurgo is, as Council members\nfreely admit, a pantomime of \" student participation\" as\ncan be seen from the ' double punishment' issue and the\nRector's avoidance of real discussion.\nOf course, many are proud to be at Imperial College. But\nthere must be some alternative to institutions which define\nthemselves in the following way:\n\" The purposes of the Imperial College are to provide\nthe fullest equipment for the most advanced training\nand research in various branches of science, especially\nin its application to industry . . . \"\n(Article II of the Charter of Incorporation, 1907). IC doesn't even claim to educate and broaden the minds of its students,\nbut stifles and narrows its members to one academic dis-c ip line. Through its lack of stimulation of any opposite\nopinions, it implies that science (as narrowly described\nabove) is the only discipline in which thought is required.\nStudents arrive from school with a proven exam-passing\nability and this is about all this system ever asks them to\nexercise. The students pass through in ever decreasing numbers to supply to country's need for scientists and are by\ntheir nature separate from and raw material for the\n\" national technology \" as Lord Penny puts it in the ICU\nHandbook. IC's products may be first class experts but,\nas H.G. Wells said (and I say now), they are all too often\nvision less, inward looking and narrow-minded.\nWhat are the alternatives? A drastic overhaul is of course\nnecessary, but this will not come unless there are people\n(students are people who know what student life is) in\ndecision-making positions at least up to the Governing Body\nlevel, who are convinced of the necessity for change. This\nmeans students with full speaking and voting rights, not\nonly \" participators \" but representatives who can be mandated and report back to General Union meetings; it also\nmeans that there must be fewer industrialists, to whom a University is a production-line of experts, on the Governing\nBody, and more of both academic staff and representatives\nof organised labour of the shop-floor variety rather than\ntame Trade Union officials who sold their souls to the\nestablishment years ago (e.g. Les Cannon, General President\nof the Electrical Trades Unions).\nAs regards the courses themselves, there must be rapid\nexpansion in the teaching of the social sciences, economics,\nsociology, politics, philosophy, languages, etc. Scientists must\nunderstand society to be able to use their science responsibility and not be blind to the applications of their work;\nthis responsibility must be to humanity rather than to private enterprise. Such courses must be of a critical nature \u2014\nexamining society as a complex process, not as a series of\nwater-tight compartments. This means not merely industrial\nrelations or management studies, which provide another set\nof courses to develop expertise in handling the problems of\nindustry, but fundamental analyses of the evolution of\nsociety. The concept of \" courses \" should be discarded for\nthat of discussions between \" staff \" and \" students \".\nIt is important to realise the very great differences between\nmaking IC more general, by expanding the courses which\nseek to train rather than educate, and increasing the real\nscope of study allowed in and around IC Incorporating\narts subjects into the IC campus would mean that they\nwould be under the same financial control and hence\nbecome mere extensions of the national technology rather\nthan areas of self-expression and genuine diversity.\nI assert my right as an individual to have a say in what\nI am taught \u2014 that means more than choosing between a series of third year options; to have a say in what my life's occupation is to be, beyond receiving careers advice as to\n\"what is the best job for me?\" The University must be a constructively critical institution and not a training-ground\nfor \" experts \".\nWho controls IC? The Governing Body appoints the\nRector, who is the de facto head of IC though his decisions\nhave to be rubber-stamped by the Governing Body after\nbeing taken by the Finance and Executive Committee of\nthe Governing Body. The Governing Body is therefore the\nultimate authority and is composed of representatives from\nthe Crown, Dept. of Education and Science, University of\nLondon, Inner London Education Authority, the various\nprofessional institutions and the major Commonwealth Governments, plus a few representatives from a few more\nsources. They are mostly industrialists.\nResearch in the universities is sponsored by the research\ncouncils, Ministry of Technology and Ministry of Defence\ntogether with the obvious Universities Grants Committee\nfinanced by the Government. According to a rather guarded\narticle in Science Journal (Jan. '69) . . . \" the UGC does have\nthe power \u2014 if not the authority \u2014- to suggest what fields\nof learning might profit most from investment; or to call a halt, as it has done recently, to new building projects in time\nof economic difficulty \".\nOn Wednesday, January 29th, Mr. Short, Secretary of\nState for Education and Science, developed this theme in a less carefully worded way: \" . . . universities should become\nincreasingly aware of the demands of the economy and it is\ndifficult to see how they could maintain their autonomy\nwithout doing so \" (Times, Jan. 30th). i.e. either the universities voluntarily do as they are told or they will be forced\nto do as they are told. The universities are not, then, autonomous institutions guided by principles of \" academic\nfreedom \" and \" intellectual tolerance \" but of profit. They\nhave to be cost-effective, which means becoming more\nthoroughly integrated with industry both for research and\ndevelopment projects, which also determines the course\ncontent (i.e. training not education) meaning that university\nlecturers talk more about their \" teaching load \" and less of\nthe educational aspects of university courses.\nIn this way the student becomes more and more like the\nworker in a factory; both are controlled by the same people,\nexcept for some very important differences that enable the\nauthorities (of the state and the universities, with the aid\nof the national press) to usually split co-operation between\nstudents and workers. Students are on the winning side in the\neducational rat-race and receive grants, a form of charity,\ninstead of wages, which emphasises the point. They are the\n\" intellectual elite \" who will get what pickings capitalism\ncan offer. But they are constrained by the same primitive\nstructure throughout society like everyone else.\nTherefore students can only move forward effectively with\nthe rest of the workers and such a struggle will be long\nand hard, but student politics, if dealt with in isolation, are\nnext to irrelevant anyway, and completely separated organ-is ation ally, from other progressive movements.\nThe changes needed following expansion\nViolence has always been an accepted form of political\nprotest; it showed itself as much in the Birmingham riots of\nthe 1880's as in the brawl on the floor of the House of\nCommons in the 1890's. It was only in the fuzzy pre-war\nyears of the 1930's that pacifism, fashionable for a short\ntime, made political violence not only deplored, as it had\nalways been, but almost redundant, except with a small\nlunatic fringe. But as a general rule it has always been the\ncase that those people who feel themselves incapable of\neither convincing others, or of being convinced in logical\nargument resort to battering their opponents into bloody\nsubmission. It is not, therefore, surprising that Universities\nare at last getting their share of this political action. When\nthey used to exist for a select few it was only to be expected\nthat violence did not erupt\u2014now it is only surprising that\nit did not follow sooner on the vast expansion of University\nplaces. This is not to deplore the expansion, only to point out\nthat the result was inevitable, given that University students\nnow come from different backgrounds, with vastly different\ntraditions and that Universities themselves have failed to\nchange to accommodate them.\nIt is therefore apparent that change is necessary, but\nbefore considering what change, it is worthwhile considering what a University is supposed to do. It must primarily\neducate, or as I am now talking about scientific establish-ment s, it must primarily train. This is not because of some\ndark bear lurking outside the campus who requires regular\nsacrifices of trained technologists, but because in science and\nengineering it is impossible to progress without having first\nabsorbed the required amount of knowledge; and the amount\nof knowledge required before the student can be allowed\nto think for himself is rapidly expanding to fill the three\nyears available. So the problem is how best to get students\nto absorb all the necessary facts. Once this has been worked\nout, it is necessary for the University to give a certain contact with the outside world; most students on entering the\nhallowed portals of our more famous research colleges have\nonly had that contact with the world about them afforded\nby the school or the family life. Just as the Grand Tour in\nthe 18th and 19th cent ure s fitted the young gentlemen for\nlife\u2014so the University must equip the young technocrat. Of\ncourse this is already done to a certain extent by the students themselves, principally in the Union, although not\nevery student is prepared to be bothered with the Union and\nrisk his degree. A University should also be a place where\nthe student can think, and form his own opinions, and\nthis is why the idea of a University as a factory for ready-made ideas is so ridiculous. Although democracy should be\nparamount, there should be as many opinions as there are\nstudents, and so it is not very flattering to the majority to\nhave its opinion put forward as the college's, for it shows\nthe students as being able to agree with glib statements on\ncomplicated issues.\nThe University is at present set up with the purpose of\nby Matthew Carrington\ngiving people degrees, and unfortunately not just a degree\nbut also a class of degrees. This is all very well if one\naccepts that examinations are the best way of assessing\nsomeones ability\u2014but in that case Universities should, like\nschools, be geared to the passing of examinations, with\nmock exams and all the rest of the para phan alia of the best\nmodern teaching techniques. But examinations are in themselves highly dubious, at best they are an indication of the\nstudents memory and stamina, and at worst a useless guide\nto his state of health. Of course, if examinations were abolished a lot else would have to change, for instance lectures\u2014\nwhich are largely redundant already owing to the poor\nquality of the lecturers\u2014would have to cease, and then the\nlecturer could distribute what he wanted to say in duplicated form, and spend the time he would normally spend lecturing in seeing students privately. The next thing is that a lot more emphasis would have to be put on the tutors, who\nwould then do the teaching the lecturers don't do. This\nwould have the advantage of bringing back the personal\ncontact between the teacher and the taught, and at the\nsame time would leave plenty of scope for modern teaching\nmethods, such as teaching machines. Of course, as the tutors\nwould be doing the assessing, each student would have\nseveral tutors. This is only a sketch outline of the changes\nI think are necessary, but it shows the direction in which I think the changes are bound to come, particularly away from\nthe impersonal towards the personal.\n\n"

    "content": "Imperial College Union has frequently suffered in the past from\nin quo racy. This h.s often prevented essential business from being\ncarried out. To overcome this problem we recommend two major chances.\nOne is the lowering of the quorum, except for constitutional changes,\nat ordinary general meetings. The second is the introduction of the\nno quorum general meeting. The flow of information and ideas between\nthe Union officers and the Union floor at present could be considerably\nimproved. This can be done by the holding of termly meetings at which\nofficers must present reports. These meetings will be sc arranged that\nthose interested will always be able to hear and discuss these important\nmatters. The six weeks warning of dates and two weeks notice of all-matters to be discussed will ensure that all union members are fully informed of what is coming up. Better com muni ct ions are ensured by\nthe specification of publicity and notification of meetings.\nWe add two major sub.-committees, of Council. The House Committee\nalready exists, chaired by the Deputy President (renamed the Internal\nAffairs VicePresident), and is merely the equivalent of an Internal\nAffairs Committee. The work it does is a load off Executive members,\nThe Finance Committee is new and will enable a small group to look in some detail at annual .estimates and extraordinary grant requests. It will also enable I.C.U, to be able to discuss the general trend of\nspending. This information will greatly help Council to be moree ff ect ive stewards of our money.\nApart from these major changes, there are a number of minor changes\nto bring the By-Laws up to date, w n ich we are not amplifying in this preamble and we feel speak for themselves.\nConcerning sabbatical years, .we do not think that we have considers\nthis nearly fully enough to make any recommendation.

Jim Haynes, the\nmain originator of the Arts\n\u2022Lab, is very concerned with\n'\" breaking down forms.\"\n^One of his colleagues Frank\n^Muller says similarly that\n'^they want people to just go\n; there, join in, and do their\n;thing.\nThe big attraction for the\n\u2022 next two months is Jane\n^Arden's VAGINA REX t AND THE GAS OVEN,\n:with Sheila Allen and Victor\nSpinetti. This is a theatrical\nproduction\u2014well worth 10/\u2014 which is something to do\nwith women. It deals with\nthe way in which society imposes behavioural patterns\non both men and women.\nThe performance is mind-shaking; the actors, acting\nmusic, incredible lighting\neffects, and screenplay arc\nreally great. Don't read a review \u2014 go and see it!\nFilms, on show nightly,\nare experimental / underground / unusual. Both\ntheatre and films are often\non simultaneously with a third area like: music,\npoetry, dancing, mime, dis-cuss ions, etc. Semi-permanent features may be: exhibitions of paintings or\nphotos, giant go nk shows,\nlight shows or whatever happens to be around, including\nfood.\nThe Arts Lab is the gateway to all sorts of Underground Happenings. The\nmagazine stall has a good\nrange of world-wide hippy\nmagazines. International\nTimes and the notices on the\nwall will tell you what's happening in London. The organisation is an arch it ic and\nconfused \u2022\n\u2014 unlike the orderly lives of most people.\nWhat happens if the Arts\nLab is too WAY OUT for\nany government subsidy\n(unlike the ICA which gets\nmassive government aid) so\u00bb\nthe Arts Lab grooves along{\nby itself.\nThe atmosphere is very 5\nfriendly and enjoyable. Conversation often centres\naround phoniness of curious\nstories and reveals many d if fences in attitudes between\nthose who \" frequent the\nUnderground\" and those\nwho do not.\n\"The Lab\" is open every\nevening and night except\nMondays. There, you can\nget a \"calendar of what is\non\", but better still read IT\n(or Time Out, for some\nitems); for up-to-date information dial 242-3047/8.\nOPEN YOUR MIND BECOME MORE AWARE FREAK OUT YOU (as a member of\nUSK) can join the Arts Lab\nfor 15/- instead of \u00a31 (ob-tain forms from Union Office and return them to\nthere). Membership entitles\nentry to the building with as\nmany guests as you want, at\n2/6 a time, and also access\nto the Electric Cinema club\n(find out about that from\nArts Lab or IT).\nPiers Corbyn.\nOne of the strangest ano-mo lies in the present student\ngrant system is the lack of a London allowance for post-graduates. At present even\nthe recently cut undergraduate grant has a London\nweighting of \u00a335. How did\nthis situation come about?\nUntil 1962 there was a London weighting on P.G. grants. In that year the Ashby report was published.\nThis surveyed the expenditure of 170 P.G. s from all\nover Britain, 18 being from\nLondon. 7 of the latter were\ndiscounted on the grounds\nthat they spent too much\nmoney, and on the basis of\nthe remaining 11 it was decided that P.G. s did not need\na London allowance! The\nreport as a whole was not\naccepted but this recommendation was, not sur pris ingly, adopted by the Government.\nReports\nThe case for a London allowance is overwhelming. It\nis manifestly obvious that it\nis far more expensive to live\nin London than in the pro-vince s, and the principle of a London allowance is accepted by the Government for\nthe Civil Service. The report\nof the Advisory Panel on\nStudent Maintenance Grants\nrecommended a London differential of \u00a340 for under-graduates. For a postgraduate attending for 44 weeks\nthis would indicate a weighting of \u00a360. Report Number\n44 of the National Board for\nPrices and Incomes, \"Lon-don Weighting in the NonIndustrial Civil Service,\"\nstated that \" it is the cost of\nliving which should be the\ndetermining factor in the\nquestion of London Weighting.\" A survey by\nA.S.T.M. S. of 60 S. R.C. financed P.G. s at I.C. was compared with the figures for\ncivil servants considered by\nthe P.I.B. It was found that\nthe cost of accommodation,\ntravel, etc. of the P.G. s was\n\u00a3272.5 p.a. compared with\n\u00a3261.2 p.a. for civil servants\nin the salary range \u00a3751\u00a31000. The P.I.B. recommended a London weighting of \u00a3120 for people in\nthis group.\nCampaigns\nThus it can be seen that\nthe case for a London allowance is very strong.\nWhat, then, is to be done?\nAlready, A.S.T.M. S. is campaigning on our behalf. London weighting for P.G. s is\nnow official N.U.S. policy.\nAs yet, however, these do\nnot seem to have involved\nthe London postgraduates\nthemselves. On 20th February, I attended a meeting of\nP.G. representatives called\nby King's College Postgraduate Society. The aim of this\nmeeting was to try and organise a campaign by London P.G. s for a London al-low ance. Strike action by\nP.G. s who do tutorial work\netc, is among the possible\nactivities being considered.\nLetters are being sent both\nto Edward Short and to the\npress. Clearly it will be\nnecessary to co-ordinate such\na campaign with A.S.T.M. S. and N.U.S. But the P.G. s of\nLondon should be in the\nforefront of their own fight.\nAnyone interested contact\nMartin Bland, 625 Tizard.\nU.S.A. Are you interested in North\nAmerica?

It\nwould be invidious to\nmention either by name, but\nperhaps salutary if we were\nto reflect \u2014 in a peculiarly\nEnglish way I hope they will\nunderstand\u2014on what makes\na President.

It will\nbe good if constitutional\nchanges are accepted which\nwould leave Sullivan-type\nPresidents freer from IC\npolitics and thus more able\nby Les Ebdon\nto do constituent college\nwork.\nEgoism\nWhen Dermott Corr and\nRex Lowin were elected to\ntheir various posts, their supporters expressed the hope\nthat they would be a new\ntype of President, with a more democratic, less egoist,\noutlook on the job. It is\nprobably the dwindling away\nof this support from progressives, which in recent weeks\nhas hardened into outright\nopposition, that has left Dermott rather sensitively ex-posed. Poor Dermott finds\nhimself in much the same\nposition as Harold Wilson,\ndistrusted by the right and\ndeserted by the left. The\nreason has been the same\u2014\na lack of courage in the face\nof opposition both from\npeople and the system, a failure to really prove he believes in what he once stood\nfor. The consequences have\nbeen much the same \u2014 sensitivity towards the Press\n(hence Corr's obsession with\nFelix; Wilson's with the\nBBC), and of late Dermott's rather unfortunate personal\nantagonism towards people\nWHAT'S OrV\nTHURSDAY\nGeneral Studies.

    "content": "Page 8 FELIX 6th March, 1969\nMany students, apparently at IC a great minority, feel that life at university should provide an education, as well as, or rather than, just schooling. It\nwas with this in mind that after general publicity of the idea 20 or so people\nmet in Committee Room A to discuss the formation of a completely informal\nGeneral Arts Group. The discussion was fairly successful and resulted in\nthe group being called Henry (for non-commit al purposes) and that there\nwould not be the normal society structure i.e. no membership list, sub scrip tion, etc. This was put to S. C.C. who granted Henry \u00a35 for this term to see\nhow successful it became, realising that there was a necessity at IC for an informal \"Arts\" association where people, inside and outside the College, could\ncome and display their own or others' \"art-forms\" whether literary, \"mus i cal\" or visual and to take part in free discussion on any subject that comes\nunder the very general heading of \"Art\".\nHENRY\nSo far this term Henry has met every Wednesday in the Union Upper\nLounge and the following art forms have been presented and discussed:\npoetry, community painting, free, expressive movement to modern and classical music, experimental colour photography and experimental publicity\n(which by the results can be said to be a failure). All these, apart from the\npoetry, have been only partially successful and on a small scale due to limited facilities and lack of participants. The poetry, however, has been quite successful ranging from synthetic McGonagal through to an extension even of\nWilliam Burroughs including some sonic poems using tape recordings, etc.,\nand a jazz-and-poetry evening has been attempted with some members of the\nJazz Club.\nIt has also been decided to publish a \"magazine\", (run on similar lines\nto the R.C.S. Broadsheet), called BEE NO which, of course, is limited to literary and pictorial presentations, but is unedited and as much material is put\nin as space (and money) allows and if sold in sufficient quantities should gradually increase its scope and content. It should be on sale now.\nAt the moment Henry has several problems most of which would be resolved if more people came to the Wednesday evening meetings so that (a) there would not need to be such emphasis on standard literary art forms,\n(b) there would be less of an inhibiting atmosphere (which has only been\nlacking at two or three meetings), (c) the likelihood of gaining permanent\npremises (admittedly extremely slight), which is very necessary if anything\nother than simple creations are to be produced, will be increased the more\npopular Henry becomes. At the moment Henry is in danger of becoming a clique, this must be avoided; if more people (writers, artists, photographers,\nactors, etc.) come, Henry will be the success it should be.\nSYMPATHY\nEmpathy is everything\nPeople are different\nEverything is subjective\nObjectivity is non-existant\nEverybody is prejudiced\nSometimes against prejudice itself\nThe whole population of the world would fit on the\nIsle of Wight\n27 White polar bears died last December\nor was it more\nor less\nor not.\nANAESTHESIA\nWhen the box\nstops screaming\nits obscene\nbanalities\nand the queen\nfades from view\nand the screen\nregains the air\nof the jungle at night\nI am afraid\nto put out the light\nafraid to look behind me\nlest I am standing there\na man going blind\nafraid of the dark\nin the land of night\na spark was struck\nin the country of sadness\na child laughed\nin the realms of winter\na zephyr blew\nin a desert of stone\na sweet flower bloomed\nin IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nHENRY was born.\nHAIKU\nAsh on the floor dies\nGo back onto the toadstool\nIt is all soap flakes\nOpening a pilchard tin\nA live one pops out\nOnto the wet floor.\n\n"

    "content": "6th March, 1969 FELIX Page 7\nCARNIVAL CONCERT: A FAILURE, BUT WHY\nFollowing the failure of the Albert Hall Carnival con-cert, which lost in the region of \u00a3800, the National Council\nfor the Unmarried Mother and her Child have no chance\nof receiving the talked of \u00a312,000 from I.C. charity appeal\nthis year. The figure suggested by Carnival Co-or d in at or Ian Jarvis after the concert was \u00a32,500, which makes a total of \u00a33,700 (together with the sum already handed over\nto the National Council). With just two weeks to go until\nthe end of term, which will virtually be the end of Carnival\nfor this session, the Carnival committee are pinning their\nremaining hopes on the raffle, which should bring in \u00a31,000,\nand the fe te to be held next term.\nOn being asked by Felix to explain the abysmal failure\nof the concert, Ian Jarvis felt that the reasons were many,\nbut basically the failure was caused by the delay in electing\nthe Carnival co-or d in at or. It wasn't until early November\nthat he had been able to form his committee, and none\nof those who expressed a willingness to work for Carnival\nhad had any previous experience of the task in hand.\nFollowing the precedence of previous years, the committee booked the Albert Hall for a concert on February 20th. As in previous years no bill had been arranged for the\nconcert, and it was assumed that the concert would automatically benefit the charity appeal to the tune of \u00a31,000,\n(Keith Guy, Chairman of Ents, stated to Council that from\npast experience there was no reason to doubt that a concert\nin the Albert automatically meant a profit). However, when\nJim George, Carnival committee member in charge of the\nconcert, started formulating ideas for the bill, and began\ncontacting professional agents, it was realised that getting\nstar attractions capable of filling the hall would be no easy\njob.\nAmerican Artiste\nAs in previous years, the idea of paying an American\nartiste a fee and expenses to come over just for the concert\nwas put forward (Simon and Garfunkel, Joan Baez and\nSalena Jones were among those being suggested at this time).\nActing on investigations made by last year's committee into\nthe probability of such a move being a success, especially\nin view of the large sum of money involved, it was decided\nthat this idea was not feasible. The committee were thus\nrestricted to British or Continental attractions. On consulting their agent as to the availability of major European\nartistes such as Mireille Mathieu, they were informed that\nnone were available on the date in question.\nThus, at this stage, British groups were the only remaining possibilities, and in this sphere it was not long before\nthe committee realised that they were amateurs playing in\na professional market. On consulting their agent as to\nwhether Jimi Hendrix was available, the committee were\ntold that he was not interested in appearing at the concert.\nAfter many withdrawals and replacements, the bill was not\nfinalised until three weeks before February 20th( even after\nthat date one group dropped out).\nDuring this time Hendrix had arranged to play two concerts in the Albert Hall during the same week as the Carnival\nconcert, and this really put paid to any hopes the committee may have had in filling the Hall. The box office attraction of every bill, including boxing, following the Hendrix\nconcerts was considerably decreased. Ian Jarvis estimates\nthat the concert would more than have broken even without\nthe counter attraction of Hendrix; the result of the counter\nattraction was that takings were just \u00a3350. as against \u00a31,150\nexpenditure.\nThe concert itself was a continuation of the same theme\nof failure: at the last moment the Nashville Teens backed\nout, and on the night one group (the Status Quo) spent 20\nminutes tuning up and left the stage 2\\ numbers later following the collapse of their base-guitarist. The continuity\nof the concert was so bad that the com per e Pete Drummond\nhad to frequently leave the stage to wait for groups to get\nready. The only two successes were the East of Eden and\nthe top of bill Spencer Davis.\nAs to the remainder of this year's carnival, Jarvis denied\nthat the adoption of the National Council has had any\nbearing whatsoever on the amount of money taken in street\ncollections; in his opinion the letter sent by Council to The\nTimes, expressing concern that people were showing their\nfeelings on the Charity in the way they treated collectors,\nwas not really justified (he was not consulted on the subject).\nCollections have not brought in as much as last year how-ever, and he is especially critical of the effort one constituent\nCollege Vice-President has put into the job of organising\ncollections.\n\u2022\nWalk a success\nThe organisation of the walk was, in bis opinion, rather\nrushed, but even so the potential benefit to Carnival is in\nthe region of \u00a31,500, although only \u00a3400 of this has so far\narrived in the Union office. This stunt is an obvious money\ndrawer, and with tighter control of the ensuing funds, should\nprove just as successful in the future.\nThe failure of Carnival week to make any impact was\ndue basically to the fact that none of the committee had\norganised any previous Carnival weeks. The discotheque\non the Tuesday coincided with one of Hendrix's concerts,\nand was completely run by just two people (one of whom\nwas Ian Jarvis). This proved inadequate to cover all the\nissues involved. A number of girls had entered the Carnival\nQueen contest merely as a joke, and it wasn't until they were\nsupposed to be parading their talents that the organisers\nfound this out. When Sir Gerald Nabarro turned up to\njudge the contest, everything had to be rushed through in\nthe 30 minutes he had available. The running of the evening was not helped by students attending Steve Moffat's21st in Southside Bar pouring into the discotheque and calling\nthose present by a name which appears to be the drunkards\nphrase of the moment. The financial profit of the evening\nwas a mere \u00a36.\nEvents lined up for the future, besides the aforementioned\nFete, are a swim of the English Channel by Physics 1 (who\nare at present experiencing difficulty in getting sponsors); a number of concerts in the R.C.M. and a one week arts festival next term.\nFILM REVIEW: 'CANDY IN WONDERLAND' by John Spence\nIt's one of those films which must give the distributing\ncompany's fees section nightmares. And it's a daring director\nwho convenes no less than Burton, Coburn, Matthau, Brando\nand Aznavour for the execution of his contract \u2014 and a clever one to boot who brings it off. \" What's new Pussycat \" probably kicked off the idea, \" Those Magnificent\nMen . . . \" succeeded well too, \u2014 \" Shalako \" deployed its\nmillion dollars worth of \" talent\" about as effectively as a suckling brat deploys toilet paper.\nIn \" Candy \" (X, Kensington Odeon) the simplest formula\npossible has been used to reconcile the different talents of\nthe af fore mentioned' Top Five '. You just film your action\nand screen it as a montage\u2014each chapter being given to one\nof your stars to use to his own gratification. For continuity\nyou use a plot, theme, ' thing', idea (delete whichever does\nnot appeal) or the approximate story of the original book\nand, of course, the heroine whose acting qualifications must\nbe minimal, so as not to get Liz Taylor jealous, but whose\nbody must be such so as to get every blok e in the place a good ten inches from his eyeballs\u2014frequently! Then, you\nhave a big-deal finale, which everyone's in and where you\ndon't really know what the hell's going on although you\nreckon it's all quite relevant. The film ends with the same\nsequence it begun with\u2014full circle\u2014game over.\nThe fact is, however, that, far from being a ham fist ed, Jerry-built affair, \"Candy\" has ended up a very funny\nevening's entertainment. I'm told the book by Terry\nSouthern and Mason Hoffenberg is a big send up of pornography \u2014 (is it possible?) but the film uses pornography\nin turn to massacre just about every demagogue and big-screen type hero to which Society is addicted. The send-up\nof some of the images might be more aptly termed a' throw-up' but the Freudian theme whereby the hip poet,\nthe combat commando, the neuro-surgeon and the mystic\nare all toppled from their lofty heights by the sight of a pink nipple, holds everything together. A hand on the wheel\nof destiny is noble but a finger on Candy's crotch is good-times a fitting epitaph, even a judgment, and the real life\nperson n ages which make-up and waffle no more than thinly\ndisguise, will no doubt wince at the sight of their alter-egos\nflickering before them.\nFirst there's the poet\u2014Macphisto\u2014into whose character\nRichard Burton manages to instill the more ludicrous\naspects of the Henrys, the Bonds, the Posters and the Ginsbergs of this earth. Macphisto\u2014with hair and sash streaming\nin an ambient hurricane, is the idol of every high-school kid\nwho's dumb enough to dote on the drivel he propagates.\nHaving waxed ominous in all manner of psychedelic verb age, he entices Candy into his cavernous Mercedes, gets sloshed\nand attempts to ravage her on the vehicle's glass floor\u2014\ngreat photography! \" Need, need \" he moans as the poor\nkid's dress becomes d elect ably shredded and it takes his\ndriver\u2014a negro called Zero\u2014to extricate her from certain\nde flo ration. Put another way, her de flo ration is certain but\nit takes none other than Ringo Starr, feebly playing Candy's Mexican gardener (hmmm m) \u2014to accomplish it. This done,\nCandy's Dad and Uncle, both played by Charles Aznavour,\nsee fit to banish her and here we meet image no. 2.\nWalter Matthau is Brigadier Al Smight of U.S. Sup. Tech.\nParacom. Int. Ltd.

Where, who, why, what or when, we do not know, but\nif Walt's spoof of an inane John Wayne type hero doesn't have you doubled up there's no hope for you.\nNext, it's Coburn's turn. He is the neuro-surgeon with\nmore degrees than a thermometer\u2014Dr. Kronkeit\u2014whose\nbrain-surgery is conducted only after a matadors entrance\nto an assembled multitude issued with programmes, and a battery of T.V. cameras and who gets a kick out of announcing with demur that, with his fingers three inches inside\nhis patient's skull, a sneeze could seriously impair the man's capacity for \u2014 digit-dialling! Needless to say he gets a few\nkicks out of Candy at the \" post-operative party \".\nNext comes a photographer whose current vocation is\nphotographing people saying \" No \" \u2014 and with 120 No's to date in his cassette he naturally gets the rest from Candy.\nIn between he has time to capture for posterity \" Man\ngoing out of door\" and, having been beaten to oblivion\nby a wicked caricature of an American Cop, he snaps his\nown epitaph by turning the lens on himself \u2014 \" Man\npassing out\".\nMore adventures, more assaults \u2014 then, the climax.\nBrando does a hilarious job as a nomadic (in a ten ton\ntruck) Guru. The seduction this time is more protracted,\nmore subtle and more funny than the rest. The undertones\nof the Kama-Sutra (convincing acting!) is never left out and\nthe \" mystic goal, the final discovery \" is, for Candy, exhaustion on the mat and for the Guru\u2014salami and cold beer\nand an admission to being a reformed mystic!\nThe finale drags the whole bunch onto the set and to beat\nmusic on a\" Haight-Ashbury \" hillside Candy walks (God\nknows how) in a transcendent trance to where and for why\n\u2014nobody tells us.\nThe idea for Candy, on film at any rate, was born as soon\nas Lewis Carroll applied quill to parchment and wrote \"Alice\nin Wonderland\". The heroines bear little comparison save a pervading air of innocence and sustained exploitation but\nI surmise Candy to be a more readily discernible comment\non the times. As a role in the film, she does bear some\nscrutiny since, having been called a slut, a tart, a whore, a lecher and a seducer there follows the ultimate ignominy\u2014\n\" and a Teenager \". If director Charles Marquand hopes to\ninstigate a move to protect this particular age-group from\nour perverted culture, a film which is very funny but base\nand implicitly perverted itself won't do the trick. By its undoubted popularity it will merely show that we, the com-m unity, are a lot like the characters in the film\u2014without\nbeing so very funny.\n\n"
