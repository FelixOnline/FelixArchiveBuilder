    "content": "2 NEWS FELIX WEDNESDAY19 TH MARCH News in Brief\nDepartment of Mining shafted?\nTONY OFORI\nAt the beginning of March, mining\nstudents in IC's department of\nEnvironmental Resources\nEngineering heard that three of their\nfour lecturers would probably be\nleaving. During a meeting held by\nProfessor Rawlings, Dean of the\nRoyal School of Mines and head of\ndepartment, undergraduates were\ntold that as of next September there\nwould be significantly less teaching\nstaff. Not only will they lose 80% of\ntheir lecturers but this will be accompanied by a reduction in support\nstaff.\nCurrently there are five courses in\nERE of which two are broadly concerned with mining techniques.\nSome 26 students stand to be affected by the changes. The mining\ndepartment may be small, but many\nstudents and staff have expressed\ntheir belief in its value as an individual subject. Gone are the days when\nminers are are pictured wearing\nWellingtons and hard hats, bearing a Davy lamp in one hand and a pick in\nthe other. Many now regard mining\nas a scientific discipline.\nSpeaking to Felix, Prof Rawlings\ninsisted that the quality of the degree\ncourses will be maintained despite\nthe cuts, and went on to point out that\nthe courses are regularly scrutinised\nby various examination bodies and\nany fall in teaching standards will be\nquickly picked up. However, many\nstudents remain unconvinced.\nPresent plans include keeping one\nof the department's principle lect ur ers, while another three are encouraged to take early retirement. These\nthree would return to work on a part-time basis, but they would only be\nrequired to work around a tenth of\ntheir current hours.\nUnderstandably, many ERE students are bewildered by the current\nsituation, and cannot see how their\ndepartment can function properly\nwith such a large reduction in teaching staff. Two new courses will be\noffered to prospective mining stu-dents, both focussing on the environmental aspect of mining. Some\nobservers fear that the intention is to\nphase out 'pure' mining degrees and\nreplace them with shallower courses\nconcentrating on environmental con-cern s. According to Prof Rawlings, \"eco-no mic considerations\" are the driving force behind this radical staff\nrestructuring. At the moment the\ndepartment feels unable to maintain\nits current staffing level within its\nbudget. The mining department in\nthe RSM is the only one in the country supported solely by research\nfunding. This presents the department with a problem: they may not\nbe able to support the staff they have,\nbut without these staff cannot hope to\nwin the funding they need.\nSome students argue that the move\nto fewer teaching staff may make\nfinancial sense but is academic non-sense. ERE undergraduates may face\na significant drop in teaching quality.\nWith only one full-time lecturer and\n26 students the staff student ratio\nwill be relatively high. In addition,\nlinks with industry forged by current\nlecturers may be severed upon their\ndeparture, making it difficult for students to gain a foothold in commercial mining.\nERE also suffers from a deficit of\nnew recruits to the teaching staff,\nwith three lecturers within 5 years of\nretirement age. In response, Prof\nRawlings alluded to the difficulty in\nfinding new lecturers in the mining\ndiscipline combining both youth and\ntalent.\nAnother point of concern is a new\nEuropean university exchange\nscheme for mining students. If the\nteaching staff leave the department\nas proposed, IC will no longer be\nable fulfill its commitment to the students from German, Dutch and\nFinnish universities. This will may\nalso have serious implications for the\nIC students participating in the\nexchange, as they may be rendered\nunable to complete their course.\nTHIEF ARRESTED\nA man wanted by the police was\napprehended in the Biochemistry\nBuilding on Monday evening. He\nwas found in possession of several\nstolen items and went to court last\nTuesday charged with a variety of\ncrimes.\nSecurity were alerted by a woman\nin the Biochemistry Dept who rang\nthem after recognising a man whom\nshe had disturbed rifling through her\nhandbag a week previously. After a brief chase, Security caught and\ndetained the man, managing to hold\nhim until the police arrived. On their\narrival the police informed Security\nthat the man was wanted for burglary\nand theft by both the Metropolitan\nand the City of London police forces.\nA disconsolate Ken Weir, Head of\nsu curit y, expressed his dismay over\nthe level of knowledge displayed by\nthe thief \"He seemed to know his\nway around the building quite well,\nhe was going into offices with open\ndoors and taking wallets and purses.\"\nThis incident again calls into question the effectiveness of College's security and raises the possibility of a full surveillance system being\ninstalled.\nUNION SHOPS AROUND FOR NEW BUSINESS\nThe Union Bookstore closes for business on Friday 21st March, and will\nremain closed for a month while\nrefurbishment takes place. When the\nBookstore re-opens on the 21st April, it will bear the new and imaginative title, 'The Union Shop'.\nThe new shop will sell the same\nproduct range as before but without\nthe books, the contract to supply\nbooks on campus having been taken\nover by Waterstones. The 'Shop'\nwill essentially sell stationery, but\nshould include a few new product\nlines. The newsagent on the opposite\nside of the Walkway will remain\nunaffected by the changes, and the\n20% sale on all books remains in\nplace until the close of business on\nFriday. Waterstone's expects to\nbegin trading on the first day of next\nterm, the same day as the new Union\nShop.\nELECTION RULES CHANGE Several changes to the rules governing ICU's sabbatical elections have\nbeen proposed, following the controversy generated by this year's cam-pa ign s. At a meeting of ICU Council last\nTuesday night, Eric Allsop, ICU\nPresident, commented that there\nwere \"holes in the election rules\", but\nthat the opportunity exists to rectify\nthis. The most significant changes\nare likely to surround the 'New\nElection' campaign, with the possibility of a body being set up to regulate its actions.\nThis would attempt to avoid a repeat of events this year, when Felix\nwas heavily criticised for its pessimistic reporting of the hustings,\nand was accused of inciting students\nto vote against the candidates. Some\nsupporters of defeated candidates\nhave claimed that Felix deliberately\nattempted to influence student op in ion, openly supporting the alternative\ncandidates should 'New Election' be\nreturned for the post of ICU pre si dent.\nAlso under consideration is a proposal to place a copy of each can di date's manifesto along side each ballot box, to allow students to read\nthem before voting. The Elections\nCommittee will decide when they\nmeet next week exactly what\nchanges are to be made.\nThe nomination papers for the new\nICU Presidential elections are to be\nput up opposite the Union office on\nthe first Monday of next term.\nSpeculation over exactly who will\nput themselves forward for the post\nis still rife.\nSILVER LINING FOR\nC LAUDS? 'Mr T's', the snack shop on the third\nfloor of the RS M building closed\ndown for good on the 3rd of\nFebruary. In its place has opened\n'Clauds', a very similar venture operated by Everdina Clarke.\nThe decision to close T's came\nwell before last Christmas, with Ms\nClarke, placing her tender for the\nshop soon afterwards. The College\nspent roughly \u00a32000 cleaning and\nsan it ising the premises before its new\nproprietors took over. Ms Clarke\nthen bought new equipment and display cabinets for sandwiches and\ndrinks. The College placed conditions on the operations of the shop,\nincluding a ban on frying as \"it made\nthe place smell\" and also to try and\nkeep prices low. According to Ms\nClarke, the few months it has been\nopen were being used as a trial peri-od. In October, she plans to add\nmore types of food to the menu\nincluding baked potatoes and intends\nto change the tables and chairs in the\neating area at some point, describing\nthe present furniture as 'gro tty'. The\nprimary concern, however, would be\nthe food.\nFind out if\nyou\nwon on\npage 9\n\n"

Then it occurred\nto me why not make it so that the\nentrance and exit were positioned\nover by a security room. Then if we\ngave all members of college (staff\nand students) some form of ID they\ncould identify themselves as they\nentered or exited with a bike.\nRevolutionary ideals that would\ncost a fortune, the cost of converting\nthat room at the entrance that dispenses snooker equipment and perhaps installing some gates would run\nto millions possibly, and as for\nremoving the individuals rights by\nmaking everyone have a ID card I can see the court of human rights\nhaving a field day. Yours heavily labour inga point\nGary Smith (Elec Eng PG)\nYes, it does make you wonder how\na bike can get stolen from the most\nsecure area in college...\npolitical bias in Felix\nDear Alex\nWhile Felix's long established\nneutrality was severely strained by\nlast week's front page news story,\nwhich many saw as advocating a vote\nfor new election, this week's new\ncolumnist seems to believe that your\npaper is a party political instrument.\nReaders may be used to Mr Baker's right wing fascist tendencies, but to\nhave a writer openly advocate voting\nfor the Liberal Democrats was just\ntoo much.\nPrevious issues of Felix with the\naforementioned Tory ranter have\nbeen intensely annoying and I did\nwonder whether any balance would\nbe applied with alternative view\npoints. Then came along Hamish\nwith his brand of 'wet conservatism'\nto further emphasise your journal's right of centre tendencies.\nBut was a column dedicated to the\npossibilities of a Lib Dem revolution\nwith an exhortation to vote for Ms\nOsei's favoured group really bal-ance? Are we to expect a column\nurging students to vote New Labour,\nand what about Old Labour, the\nReferendum Party and the Official\nMonster Raving Loony Party?\nWith the General Election rapidly\napproaching I would urge you to\npublicly state where your paper\nstands on this issue. Would it be too\nmuch to ask for Ms Osei and particularly the ravings of Messers Baker\nand 'Common' to be controlled, if\nnot gagged?\nIn the hope of an independent and\nneutral student newspaper,\nBen Weir\nDelegations from the parties you\nmentioned have yet to beat a path\nto my door, so for now we shall\nhave to suffice with the metered\nopinions of those who are prepared\nto put pen to paper.\nIn any case, I would refute the\nsuggestion that Miss Osei's piece\ncame down firmly for the Liberal\nDemocrats. The view that some\nform of change, as opposed to the\nunited front presented by the two\nmain parties on most issues, would\nbe beneficial for the country is a valid one. The Liberal Democrats,\ncoming next in line and with a sizeable political heritage themselves,\nwould be the logical suggestion for\nsomeone purporting to support a new direction for British politics.\nFor more detail on this matter\nand to set your mind at rest over\nthe bias of this paper, I would\ndirect your attention to this week's feature on the PPC's for the Cities\nof London and Westminister con-st it u en cy. imperial to tty nil point\nDear Felix,\nIn response to your \"Imperial\nTotty\" article in last weeks Felix, I would like to make the following\ncomment to the female student quo t ed. Although not all the 71.4% of the\nmale students at IC are \"top notch\",\nof the remaining 28.6%, not all could\nbe considered to be women, but more\nappropriately could be described as\nfarmyard animals.\nOffended IC student\nDear Felix,\nHaving read your News in Brief\narticle 'Imperial Totty' I felt I had to\nreply. Bollocks.\nTalk about the pot calling the kettle black. The law of averages dictates that at least a few of the 6000\nmales at IC must measure up enough\nfor the mere 2000 birds, whereas\nthey, frankly, fall into the category\n'rough'. Perhaps if some Cosmo\nreaders would come shark in' it\nwould provide us with some decent\nscenery. For a change.\nSigned on behalf of the frustrated\nmale majority of Imperial who have\nstandards by a selection of\nImperial s manhood\nConsidering the fact that the\nsource of the article had nothing to\ndo with the female population of\nthe college, these two replies seem\nto go after them rather unfairly.\nAre we perhaps seeing some inferiority complex coining out here\nboys? It would be a shame if the\nhordes of Cosmo reading women,\nwho are without a doubt making a beeline for our august institution\nas I write, were to be put off by the\nexamples of IC 'manhood' that are\npresented here.\nSo I suggest that all of you (and I note that the authors of these letters have hidden behind the shield\nof anonymity) turn yourselves in to\nthe 'grotesque IC male' amnesty\nthat Felix is willing to operate for\nthe betterment of our en v iron ment. That should leave the better\nadjusted people behind to lead rea-son able, valuable fat-free lives.\nreview blues\nDear Felix,\nAfter reading the review of the\nnew U2 album, POP, in Something\nfor the Weekend, I felt compelled to\nwrite. There is a serious need to set\nthe record straight for any of the\nreaders out there who feel slightly\nbemused.\nIt's a sad state of affairs when the\nreviewer finds a need to waste half of\nhis column space on attacking the\nband's new direction. U2's fans have\nnot been brought up on steady \"eco-rock and emotive ballads\". True,\nthose who appreciate U2's creative\ndrive and eagerness to include new\nideas and new directions will appreciate the album the most. But those\nwho do not, have either been spoon\nfed a diet of Oasis & Blur three times\na day for the last 2 years or they find\nno joy in change. Lets face it U2 have\nbeen so successful because of the\nability to incorporate new style and\ndirection into their music. Not by sitting back and relying on the same\ntried and tested formula.\nAnother point which I found quite\nhard to comprehend was the slamming \"Bono and the boys\" got for\ncontinuing to give the public a show.\nRather than spitting and sticking two\nfingers up at any question or challenge posed to them, they come right\nback and produce an album with all\nthe hype that goes with a U2 pro duc tion. Hype and change are what\nwe've come to know and love about\nthe boy's. The hype aside, the album on a first listening did not seem to give all\nthat was promised. However on a second listen it becomes apparent\nwhy we've waited in anticipation for\nso long to be given the next install-ment. The wait was worth while and\nif any of the reviewer listened to the\nalbum more than once and gave a shit\nabout what he was doing, then this\nwould have become apparent.\nDiscotheque was a production\nwhich shocked and wet the appetites\nof the waiting public when released a few weeks ago. Bono is in his element writing some moving ballads\nsuch as If God Will Send His Angels\nand If You Wear That Velvet Dress.\nThere is so much to take in during\none listen, electro experimentation,\nsoaring melodies, and emotive lyrics,\nforgetting to mention the breaks and\nMullens strongest drumming to date,\nwhich does far more than keep the\nrhythm. The rest of the album delivers as far as I'm concerned, roll on\nthe tour in the summer. How will\nthey top the Zoo tv tour? is the question on most peoples lips. I'm sure\nwe won't be disappointed.\nA final word to any of the review-ers. Listen to what the fuck your\nreviewing and don't dismiss something because that's the easy option.\nAnd remember we are people concerned with change not sitting stagnant dismissing any progress, simply\nbecause its not the norm.\nA Jarvis (Maths I) Sometimes it would be nice to get\nsomething right! I agree with a lot\nof what you say, though I would\npoint out that you are speaking\nform the perspective of a U2 fan.\nThe reviewer in question wasn't.

    "content": "FELIX WEDNESDAY19 TH MARCH POLITICAL FEATURE 11\nWhat are you doing on 1st May?\nWith the General Election just weeks away Felix has\ngathered together a host of politicians to lay out their\nstalls and describe why they are worth voting for. We\nchose the candidates for the 'Cities of London and\nWestminster', an area which covers Prince's Gardens,\nBayswater, Knightsbridge and Buckingham Palace.\nWe questioned them on issues such as the privatisation of London\nUnderground, their views on the need for a strategic authority for the\ncapital, and other constitutional matters. However space has not\nallowed for their wisdom on these matters to be displayed. Overleaf\nis a brief synopsis of their background, their views on tertiary e duca tion, its funding, and how they see the local constituency situation.\nIf for some strange reason you would like to see the full extent of\ntheir outpourings, then the full 11,000 word epic is available from the\nFelix office. Otherwise you can read the condensed versions and\nmake up your own mind, or just rely on your own preconceptions.\nHow to make sure that you get your vote\nThe easiest way to find your relevant constituency is to use\nOnlinemagic's1997 General Election website and their\n'Constituency' section. Using your postal code you will be informed\nof your constituency, the three main party candidates and the relevant\nBorough. Remember to use the place where you were on 10 October\n1996, as this is the address which is used for electoral purposes.\nThe next stage is, knowing your relevant Council, to find a local\nlibrary and check to see whether your name is on the electoral regis-ter, or alternatively to make a grovelling phone call to the Council. If\nyour name is on their list then you're fine, but if it is not there then you\nneed a Claim Form, which can be obtained from your local Council,\nsome of whose numbers are listed below.\nElectoral Registration Offices:\nCity of Westminster (including Princes Gardens) 0171 798 2730/1\nKensington & Chelsea (including Evelyn Gardens) 0171 361\n3444/2052\nHounslow (including Clayponds) 0181 862 5097\nWhat happened last time and what's going to happen this time?\nWhile the 1992 General Election was run with\nvery different constituencies to those that are being\nused this time round, their results are presented\nhere for comparative purposes. The main change\nis that the 'Kensington' constituency has been broken up, the majority of which has been added to\nSir Nicholas Scott's old 'Chelsea' seat to become\n'Kensington and Chelsea'. The remainder, five\nnorthern wards which had predominantly supported Labour, is being added to the majority of\nthe old 'Westminster North' constituency to\nbecome the new 'Regents Park and Kensington\nNorth' seat. The final change is that the Bayswater\nand Lancaster Gate wards, both Conservative\nminded areas, have been added to Sir Peter\nBrooke's old seat to become the new 'Cities of\nLondon and Westminster' constituency.\nThe above changes mean that Alan Clark\nshould have little trouble winning the new\n'Kensington and Chelsea' constituency for the\nConservatives. Considering the votes cast in the\nlast General Election his party has a51.5% majority over the Labour Party's contender, Robert\nAtkinson. Robert Woodthorpe Browne from the\nLiberal Democrats is also contesting the seat.\nSir Peter should have an equally easy ride in the\nnew 'Cities of London and Westminster' seat as\nthe redrawn boundaries give him a spectacular\n35.2% lead over Labour.

    "content": "FELIX WEDNESDAY19 TH MARCH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT 17\n\"Many 'monsters' offer equally impenetrable exteriors. They\nare eliminated on the mere consideration of the facts. Apparently\nthe nature or the magnitude of their crimes allows no room for\nimagining that they can ever repent or reform. They must merely be kept from doing it again, and there is no other solution but\nto eliminate them. On this frontier, and on it alone, discussion\nabout the death penalty is legitimate...\"\nAlbert Camus, \"Reflections on the Guillotine\"\nPerhaps the best demonstration of a judiciary system that includes the sanction\nof death for the most serious of crimes is the USA. 38 states practise the death\npenalty, and there are also 60 capital federal crimes, with federal law stating that the method of execution shall not be cruel or unsual. These states\".1\nexecute, not because it has been shown to be an effective deterrent; but\nthat it is a fitting punishment for crimes such as murder.\nExecution is surrounded by such a stigma that sends a signal that the crime\ncommitted is utterly immoral. As a society we have a duty to display the intolerance of immoral behaviour.\nEvery person is a single moral entity that is capable of decision, right or\nwrong. In just the same way that many people are praised for their good moral\ndecisions, criminals should be punished for their immoral decisions. This\nmakes justice seem vengeful, but justice is just that, regulated revenge by society for immoral deeds with a punishment to fit the crime.\nPunishment by death for murderers e qui lib rates the weight placed on the life|9\"\nof the victim and that of the murderer; without such punishment the murder-er's life appears to be more sacred than the of the victim. Removing murderers from society takes away the capacity of and forcibly prevents the recurrence of violence, maxim ising public safety. Figures have shown that over\n10% of people on death row are there for more than one murder. Had they\nbeen sentenced to death, rather than life with the possibility of parole, than 4\ninnocent lives may well have been saved.\nBut surely state sanctioned murder is one of the greatest invasions of i qm our civil rights? Civil rights s hold be inherent in our society, but a J Hr deliberate deviation from what society expects should be punishable jj m by the removal of such rights. We don't complain when thieves are fP\nimprisoned, for they have voluntarily given up, in their decision to\nsteal, their rights of freedom. People who deliberately kill have\ninvaded an innocent person's right to life, and have given up all their\nown civil rights in their decision to commit murder. Society should\nhave the right to reduce the civil rights of people by a level that fits\nthe crime, which in the case of pre-meditated murder is death.\nThe death penalty is a means by which society can regulate its moral ||\nstanding. The sanction of execution for intentionally causing the death\nensures that things remain equal between the criminal and victim, which\nessentially is society itself.\nSurvey Questions\n1. Are there still capital offences in the United\nKingdom? (yes there are)\n2. Do you think it acts as a deterrent?\n3. Are you generally in favour of capital punish-ment?\n4. Should Britain extradite people to face charges\nfor a capital offence?\n5. Do you think under 18s should be eligible for\nthe death penalty?\n6. Are you in favour of public executions?\nThe deliberate, methodical and pre-meditated termination\nof someone's life is an action abhorrent to all of us who\nbelieve we live in a civilised and enlightened society.\nCollectively we choose to punish those who breach thi\nfundamental of humanity. This is right and proper, for the foundations of our society has to be tested continuously. However, in some parts of our global society legitimate\ngovernments have discarded the advances of thousands of years of civilisation and taken themselves as low as the perpetrators of murderous\ncrime by the use of a deliberate, methodical termination of someone's life as a deterrent.\nThe validity of this deterrent should not be in question. It is mediaeval and barbaric, inhumane and fecund and has no place in any modern\nsociety. The usefulness of this tort u rous treatment is also in doubt.\nSurveys and statistics have shown repeatedly that the effect on the levels of crime is minimal and is often instigates an increase.\nThe power that is inherent in capital punishment is widely abused by\nthose who have no right to end another human's life. Look, for example,\nat the overwhelming proportion of black inmates on death-row in\nAmerica's southern states. The ratio exceeds by far that of crimes\ncommitted by black people. The death of a murderer does not make\nup for the death of his victim, but imprisonment and rehabilitation\nmay lead to some repayment to society by the criminal. Also, the\ndeath of a prisoner takes no account of the possibility of a mistake in\nthe legal process, as has happened several times in recent years.\nIndeed, one of the last people to be hanged in Britain was later found\nto be innocent. Who then shall we hang in their stead?\nAs for the British who may think that they can rest on their laurels and\nsay that the death penalty has been abolished in the Sixties, it wasn't.I The punishment can still be given for the civilian and military offence of\ntreason and several other military offences. Still feel loyal to our co un try?\nI shall quote an example of the premeditated torture that we inflict\nupon our fellow humans. John Evans, who was executed by electrocution in 1983, was given three charges over a period of 14 minutes.\n\\f ter the first and second charges, Mr Evans was still conscious and\nthere was smoke coming from all over body as a result of his burning flesh.\nWhen it comes to the crunch, death row is not filled with the serial killers and cold-blooded murderers that we imagine, but people who invariably poor, are usually of below average in tell i gence, and have led un glamourous and undistinguished lives.\nThey find themselves up against a system driven by the need\nfor revenge, and are in no position to counter it. It is not a system we can be proud of.\nYes No Survey Responses\n78%\n28%\n6% 94%\n82%\n\n"

He\nthen proceeded to score 34.4 out of\n35.7. He was said to be disappointed\nat dropping one but this performance\nstill guaranteed C&G victory thanks\nalso to sterling efforts from Rupert\nIngham and Lawrence von Gould.\nThe exact placing were 1s tC&G185.8;2 nd RSM 173.0; 3rd RCS\n171.4.\nWednesday nineteenth of March\ngas been declared a full-bore day.\nThis could be your last chance to\nshoot the guns that will soon by\nbanned.

Everything proceeded\nwithout hitch, until we were confronted with a tricky section near\nBethseda. Ross at this point consulted a local for route advice (he followed a duck), but Colin swam under\nour feathered friend's route gui d ance. Plenty of choice on the next\nGlaslyn, whilst Jools tackled the\ngorge with more enthusiasm than\ncontrol, after the reserve force of\nGarth, Colin and Adam turned up\nwith some new kit, very handy when\nyour best set of paddles have just\nbecome 'missing in action'.\nFood in the pub was OK, but there\nwas a disappointing level of interest\nin the beer from the boys, although\nthe backwards ladder climbing game\nwas strangely popular on return to\nthe hut.\nRain that night caused rivers to\nrise. Scouting early, the Ogwen\nlooked ripe to paddle, but on arrival\nlater the level had risen considerably,\nand just looking inspired 'The Fear'\nin most members present. Today's paddle looked to be an exercise in\nproving adrenaline to be brown and\nto accumulate in the back of your\nwe tty. After checking what the rest\nof the river looked like below the\nGun Barrel (it's that fast!), it was\ndecided that this was probably just\nabout within (at?, beyond?) the limits\nof most of those present. We're a sturdy bunch, but this was a trip only\nthe truly mad would attempt.\nSetting off, Piers and Garth took\nthe foolish step of running the Gun\nBarrel, in the Topo Duo. After a painful swim and some comedy rope\nrescues, we set off again, but with\nstretch as we made it to the start of\nthe hard bit - Fisherman's Gorge.\nLots of water pouring down a boulder channel made for a very technical\nand intensive descent. This certainly\ntook it's toll on the boys - Jez and\nJames falling early (although the\nDuo did land on an upside down Jez,\nrather prompting him to get out).\nGarth and Jools ran most of the\nlength of this section with few problems -the Topo sheds pins very e as i ly, and they almost seemed in con-tro l. However the sheer number of\ndrops meant that a mistake had to\ncome.... only three more little drops\nto the end too. The Gorge claimed\nfive swims, with Neil demonstrating\nhis stunning lack of ability to paddle\nroll. Ben and Adam also swam on the\nlast section, to their great annoyance\n(and our delight?), and so with just\nthree left paddling, it really meant it\nwas time to throw in the towel.Our\nthanks to Frank, Rob and Piers for\nstanding in the rain and strapping the\nboats on must be recorded here.\nPoor swimming excuses from this\ntrip -Nothing at all from Ross, for being\nthe only one not to swim.\n\"I got stuck upside down in a hole\nfor ages\" (Adam)\n\"The Duo landed on top of me\"\n(Jez)\n\n"

The two BAYS days were\nbilled as \"Two days of fun and discovery for 6-13 year olds, schools\nand families at the science festival\nthat launches SET '97- the national\nweek of science, engineering and\ntechnology.\"\nFriday's event was mainly intended for school parties, who turned up\nin their hundreds to see displays by\nBritish Aerospace, Sun Systems,\nThames water, Glaxo Welcome and\nthe Armed Forces. The demonstrations included experiments with\nchemical slime, raspberry jelly lasers\nand that perennial favourite, exploding custard.\nThe participating companies\nadopted varying approaches to the\nevent, with some displays, such as\nthat from Sun Systems, aimed mainly at the adults in the parties while\nGlaxo Wellcome's presentation was\nclearly intended to provide 'hands\non' experience of basic science principles for the younger visitors.\nDemonstrators at the British\nAerospace display claimed that their\nmain thrust was in sparking interest\nPHOTOS: LILY Young scientists and engineers getting to grips with demonstration and\npractical displays at the British Association of Young Scientists' Science\nand Engineering Week '97.\nin science, while their display also\ncontained elements obviously\ndesigned to promote BA among a more mature audience. Their collection of small autonomous robots,\nhowever, proved popular with everyone that saw them.\nThe teachers and parents present\nalso differed in their attitude to the\nevent, with some bringing pupils\nhoping to promote an interest in sci-en ce, while others saw the occasion\nas an opportunity to give their\ncharges a brief respite from the tedium of the classroom.\nThe second invasion was somewhat more carefully regimented,\nconsisting a small army of middle\naged men in suits, attending the\nlaunch of SET '97, YES (the Year of\nEngineering Success) and the BAYS\ndays.\nIn turn, the Duke of Kent, Ian\nTaylor MP( Minister for science and\ntechnology) and heads of the various\ninterested organisations showered\nthe assembled suits with acronym-laden rhetoric concerning the\nincreasing importance of science and\nin particular engineering to our\neveryday lives.\nMany observers were disappointed that pure science was largely\nignored in the speeches, although\nthose on the stands stressed that\ntoday's science will be tomorrow's technology. British Aerospace in particular were positive about working\nwith universities (including IC) on\nprojects with no immediate technological applications.\nNumerous pieces of technology\ndeveloped by Imperial College\ngroups were on display, including a laser cutting device which launched\nSET '97, theatrically etching the ini-ti at ive's name into a piece of plastic.\nThis technology is similar, it was\npointed out, to that used in cutting\nholes to reduce turbulence in aircraft\nwings.\nOne teacher described the event as\n\"brilliant\", while the minister for\nScience and Technology somewhat\nmistakenly described it as a coming\ntogether of IC and UCL, which it was\nnot. Elsewhere hundreds of unconcerned school children squealed with\ndelight over green slime.\nIncompetent' Overseas Students' Committee under fire\nMARIA IOANNOU\nThe executive of the Overseas\nStudents' Committee faced the possibility of a vote of no confidence at\nICU Council last Tuesday, after the\nUnion's Budgets Advisory Group\nrecieved no annual budget from the\nOSC despite repeated reminders of\nthe approaching deadline for budget\nsubmissions.\nBAG, a subcommittee of the\nUnion Finance Committee, recommended to Council that the OSC,\nwho they described as \"grossly\nincompetent\", recieve a vote of no\nconfidence, effectively sacking them.\nHowever, believing that this somewhat extreme measure might result\nin the total disintegration of the OSC,\nmembers of the Council turned down\nthe proposal as there would be noone to replace the existing executive.\nIn an attempt to defend herself,\nDespina Crassa, the present OSC\nchair, raised a myriad of points, some\nof which were confirmed by various\nmembers of Council. That the BAG does not provide a good 'model'\nbudget, Despina claimed, is problematic for many of the Union's clubs\nand societies.\nMs Crassa went on to confess \"I'm useless at tax and VAT, I don't know\nwhat's going on.\"\nDespina also told the Council how\nshe had recieved last year's OSC\npapers in a Sainsbury's bag and\nasked how she was meant to write\nbudgets, arrange International Night,\nand sort out the \"mess\" left by the\nprevious years OSC, all with the help\nof \"one competent, and one in com pet ant treasurer, who in effect cancel\neach other out.\"\nPiers Williams, Deputy President\n(Finance and Services) who headed\nBAG this year, proposed that those\nclubs that behaved incompetently\nwith regards to their budgets recieved\neither a \"Slap\", a \"Big Slap\" or a \"Very Big Slap\". The OSC were\ndeemed worthy of a \"Very Big Slap\",\nand the beleaguered Ms Crassa was\nasked to submit the budget by next\nweek at the latest. She was also\ninformed that all the Overseas\nStudents' Societies for which she is\nresponsible face having their budgets\ncut to two-thirds of the amount they\nrecieved this year.\nIn defence of Despina, Sarah\nCorneille, Deputy President (Clubs\nand Societies) said that she did not\nthink that the OSC had \"neglected\ntheir duties over the year as a whole,\nnot to the extent where a vote of no\nconfidence would be the correct\ncourse of action.\"\n\n"

I read History in the\nUniversity of London, at Westfield College, where\nMarion [Director of Personnel] was. 1 did a PGCE\nat Oxford afterwards, it was quite interesting.\nWhen I came to do my teaching practice I had a super school, discipline wasn'ta problem, but I thought there was no way I wanted to teach History\nuntil I'm65. When I was at college I was secretary\nof the union for a year, I tended to be a reasonably\norganised sort of person so I started looking for\njobs in education administration.\nI was out of work for six months after leaving\nOxford but then within a week, I think it was\nNovember '71,1 was offered two jobs a the same\ntime. One was in the Education and Training\nDirectorate of the CBI, and the other to work as an\nadministrative assistant in the private office of the\nCollege Secretary at University College. I chose\nthe latter and there are two reasons why. One was\nthat I couldn't see the career path was with the CBI\nand it wasn't as strong as it is these days and it was\nmore politically conservative than it is now, and\nthe other was that at University College the post\nwas on an incremental scale, of three, and they\nwere offering me a \u00a3100 a year more to start. So I started on \u00a31600 in 1971.\nWhat does your job as Academic Registrar\nentail?\nI think the one place where universities and\ncompanies are different is that we have a registry.\nOur one starts with schools liaison and we have an\noffice that is involved with admissions - this is the\nWembley Arena that Simon Baker so fondly\nremembers. Once you've come we have an office\nthat looks after students records, people will come\nand get their Council Tax certificates or to get a transcript of what they have done while they have\nbeen here. There is another big office called the\nstudent finance office, and that gives out peoples\nmaintenance grant cheques. That office also deals\nwith student loans and Access funds.\nThat's very much the nuts and bolts of things but\nthere's also the policy side so all of the major academic committees are serviced by me or one of the\ndeputy registrars. Most of these are involved in\nmaking sure that above departmental level proposals that individual parts of the College want to put\ntogether are considered in an informed way by the\nCollege community and that decisions are made\nfor the best interests of the community as well as in\nthe interests of the department.\nYou mentioned Access funds, isn't there a Hardship fund as well?\nYep. The Hardship fund we have greater control\nover to whom that can be given. For the Access\nfund we have a template which we are provided by\nthe government in effect, and this year the template\nhas changed in a significant way where unless a student has taken out a student loan, you can't have\nany access funds. You may agree with that or you\nmay disagree with that but, but, we've got no control over that so we have to apply the rules.\nDo you get many applications?\nI think that students hit the ground running and\nthere seem so many to begin, perhaps it has\nincreased with greater knowledge of its availability but its a major exercise each year to determine\nthat for Tony Cullen, the deputy registrar. He provides me with his proposals and I sample 20 or 30\nand satisfy myself that those who get more are\nmore deserving than those who get less, but it's not\nan exact science.\nYou deal with applications to College. Can you\ntell me the breakdown between state schools\nand non-state schools successful applications?\nLet me not answer that by going back a step. If\nyou look in the prospectus and some of our other\npublications, you will see an equal opportunities\npolicy for students, and to paraphrase what that\nstatement says is that IC wants to recruit the best\nstudents no matter where they come from.\nWe know through our schools liaison office\nwhich schools frequently provide us with pupils\nand we can track how well they perform when they\ncome. I joke sometimes that here at IC people\ncrave for statistics and if it moves then put it down\non a piece of paper, but we certainly haven't studied the link between students' origins and their success. When, if ever, you leave here, what would you\nlike to be remembered for?\nWhen I came here, the perception was that\nundergraduate teaching was not taken seriously\nenough and as the first secretary of the undergraduate careers committee I think I provided a catalyst\nfor raising the profile of teaching skills and learning skills in a variety of ways.\nSecondly, whereas the teaching quality assessment visits for each department have ownership in\nthat department, when the College as a whole was\nsubject to this academic audit in the early- to mid-nineties, there wasn't ownership, we didn't have a Pro-Rector educational quality, and for nearly\nthree years, I lived and breathed trying to make\nsure that it was transparent that we did have quality assurance procedures which for an institution\nthat is really quite good in many of its provisions,\nwhere the means of demonstrating that we were\nand so we could monitor that we were.\nWas a Managing Director here a good idea?\nI personally think the experiment didn't work. It\nwas because the administration at that time was\nperceived not to be fulfil ing the academic mission\nof the institution; that some parts of the administration had an agenda that was not in step with\nwhat the majority of the college community wanted to achieve and that caused serious tensions. I think it has taken up time, but we are back to a model with a college secretary and, I would say it\nwouldn'tI, but I would say that the heads of\nadministrative divisions do understand what the\ncollege is trying to achieve and they do work rather\nwell together. Well, you can judge better than me,\nyou have interviewed almost all of them. I think\nthat they are human.\nWhat has had the biggest influence on your life?\nI 've got a father, who is 92, who is still going but\nnot quite going strong. He probably had the greatest impact because he is such a reasonable person\nexcept when it comes to the Irish Question. He's an\nUlsterman and he has got no sense when it comes\nto that. My wife keeps me on the straight and nar-row.\nWhat do you do in your spare time?\nI play tennis, I play squash. I 've got a son who is\n14, he and I particularly like a particular\nMegadrive game, which is called' EA Hockey,\nwhich is an ice hockey game. I'm not bad at that\neither, I enjoy it.\nWhat make and model was the first car you\nbought?\nI inherited a mini from my brother who had been\ngiven one for his 21st birthday. He was seven years\nolder than me so he then went to Ceylon to work,\nwhen I was 15. This thing was put into mothballs\nand I used to start it up religiously every week until\nI was 17 and was allowed to drive it. It was almost\nthe first version of the mini, creamy white. I had a succession of minis which got progressively more\npowerful until I progressed to a Fiesta which was a fiasco. It was painful. I bought that without having\ntest-driven it, and I have never bought a car since\nthat I haven't test-driven.\nCould you describe an anecdote typical of you\ntime as a student.\nWe used to have to write an essay for a weekly\ntutorials, and instead of reading this out and sending everyone else to sleep, my tutor, Mrs\nAnderson, said that we should prepare a resume to\nbe read from notes or off the top of our heads. I can\nremember vividly Vernon being very big headed in\nthose days and I decided to do it off the top of my\nhead and it was not very good, and at the end I said\n'I'm awfully sorry Mrs Anderson, that was a bit\nwoolly wasn't it.' She looked at me over her half\nglasses and in front of all my friends and peers she\nsaid \"Mr McClure, you flatter yourself.'\nWords: Alex: photo: Neville Miles,\nCollege photographer\n\n"

I was\na Councillor in North London, and then I became a Member of Parliament again.\nYou talked about your background in pol-it ics, you were a councillor in London\nbefore you became an MP?\nI was councillor in the Highgate ward of\nCamden, my father had been a Member of\nParliament for Hampstead. I am a sixth generation Member of Parliament, I don't mean in\na straight line, but in each generation for the\nlast two centuries there has been a member of\nmy family in the House of Commons, and the\nvery first was the Member of Parliament of\nArmagh, that's in County Armagh.\nFor security reasons the former Secretary of\nState for Northern Ireland declined to say\nwhether he currently lives in the con-st it u enc y.\"I am actually in favour of\nhigher pay for academics\"\nDo you regard the Dearing Commission as an\nattempt to take third level education off the\npolitical agenda until after the General\nElection?\nI did think that, when they announced it, the fact\nthat Blunkett immediately welcomed it, was a clear\nindication that both sides were kicking it into\ntouch. I don't actually think that was a totally bad\nthing because it wasn't taking it off the agenda, it\nwas just simply saying that we've reached the\npoint where we do actually need to take a look at\nit. I have got a lot of time for Dearing and I think\nDearing is very good news.\nWhat about the future do you see it as a graduate tax?\nI should have thought we would go the way of\ngraduate tax, and I think that there will be an element of fees being paid by students, tuition fees\nbeing paid by students.\nYou say you think that a graduate tax is probably the way we're going, you're not terribly\nworried by this?\nEvery time this government has changed the\narrangements, of all the changes that have made\nsince 1983, there have been statements that this is\nthe end of civilisation as we know it, and civilisation doesn't seem to have come to an end. The\nnumber of people coming into higher education\nhad continued to expand dramatically and more\nthan half the student body are now mature students,\nI think it is a remarkable success story.\nSo basically you accept that it's going to happen\nand that it's not a big disaster?\nI think that it's going to happen, I can't predict the\nprecise manner in which it's going to happen, at\nthe moment only one in thirteen of the people who\nare repaying student loans are defaulting on them,\nWhat Who's Who have to say:\nBROOKE, Rt.

I am actually\nin favour of higher pay for academics, I think\nyou run the risk if you don't actually make it\nan attractive profession, you run the risk of\nthem going to other parts of the world if you\nmake the rate of return less than satisfactory.\nWhy should the Science and Technology\nMinister not be a Cabinet position?\nThere is a limit to how many cabinet ministers\nyou can have, there is actually a statutory\nlimit, you can't more than a certain number of\nministers. At the moment it isn't even done at\nMinister of State level, it's done at a Parliamentary Secretary level. It so happens\nthat the man who's doing it at the moment is\nextremely good, he's actually very well qualified for doing it. We had a shared responsibility when Mr Waldegrave was doing it,\nwhere he was both doing science and doing\nthe civil service, and all those aspects of the\npublic sector. I can't remember what took\nWilliam out of it.\n\"I am a sixth generation\nMember of Parliament\"\nDo you see science and technology as important\nenough to warrant a cabinet position?\nI don't think that it's a big enough job for it to be\nthe only job that somebody did, therefore I had no\ndifficulty at all with William Waldegrave's contribution and I gather it was regarded as extremely\neffective within the science community.\nSo is that an acceptance that it is important\nenough?\nIn my view you would have to have a strong reason for not giving to cabinet level responsibility.\nDo you know the Referendum Party candidate,\nSir Alan Walters [former aide to Margaret\nThatcher]?\nI know him slightly because he was of course at\nNo. 10.1 was in and out of No. 10, and of course I saw him then, but I don't him well. He was the economic adviser.\nPresumably you would have some respect for\nhim then?\nOf course I do, of course you would have respect\nfor him.\nDo you expect him to gain very many votes?\nWell he will gain a number of votes, a number of\nvotes from people who feel very strongly. A number of people have very kindly written to me and\ntold me that they're going to vote for him. Nice\nthing about being a Member of Parliament, they're\npeople whom I have had dealings with in the past\non constituency matters and they've written, in a sense almost a polo gi sing, and I 've written back\nand we've had a good discussion. So there are\nsome people who do it because they feel very\nstrongly about it, and there will be other people\nwho want to do it because they want to exercise a protest vote of one sort or another.\n\n"

Imperial were thrown in the\ndeep end with their first race against\nGuy's& Thomies which ended up\nbeing a close action, adrenaline\npumping, Euro 96 kind of race, with\nof course a final mistake costing\nImperial the white ribbon. After a few confidence building races\nagainst other colleges and some time\nto sober up from the night before, the\nDT shaken Imperial squad were set\nup for the leagues second round race\nagainst Guy's& Thomies. This time\nImperial took control with Simon\nSmith and James \"FLEES\" Lees having to slow down due to their\nimmense speed, while the 2 Andys\n(Jones & Keen) played around with\nGuy's& Thomies boats holding\nthem back.\nSo the stage was set with both\nteams recording one loss each and a one race final being the decider. The\nfirst start was a lucky escape since\nSimon & FLEES were using London\nUnderground watches, so they\nthought the start was a minute later\nthan everybody else thought. So\nafter the Guy's& Thomies boats\nwere recalled back, after sailing into\nthe sunset in a clear winning position,\nthe start was once more sounded but\nthis time Imperial taking the commanding position and WINNING.\nThanks go out to Tony and Tash\nfrom Castaways for running the\nevent. Good luck to Imperial Sailing\nTeam in their BUSA qualifiers.\nAll-comers tangoed by IC\nOn Saturday 8th March, 24 Imperial\nCollege Dance Club Team members\ntravelled to Watford Town Hall to\ncompete in the Inter Varsity Dance\nAssociation (IVDA) Competition. In\ntheir usual spectacular style they won\nthe competition, beating strong\nopposition from Cambridge, Oxford,\nBristol and UL U to name just a few.\nThey picked up the A Team trophy,\n2nd Place B Team Trophy and 3rd Place C Team, displaying yet again\ntheir superiority on the dance floor.\nWith feathers, sequins and chiffon\nflying everywhere, Jo Silmon-Clyde\n(Team Captain) and Helen Chung,\nDavid Schaefer and Ruth Bundy\nachieved 2nd Places in the Quickstep\nand Waltz respectively for the ATeam. The Jive competition was a closely fought affair with Nevil\nPesika and Hazie Hamzah collecting\n2nd Place for the Latin A Team after\nonly five days practice. Naveen\nGunawardane and Lianne Huang\nsailed into their 2nd Place position\nwith their evocative version of the\nCha-Cha-Cha.\n101 Dalmations, (well, 16 any-way), slid, pranced and prowled\naround the dance floor to win the offbeat competition, (formation dan c ing). However, even the cute dog\noutfits made by the team members\ncould not have won without the\namazingly attractive Cruella De Vil\n(David Schaefer) in his/her black\ndress, long eyelashes and wild hair-do.\nWinning is not a new concept to\nIC Dance Club. They are arguably\nthe best University Dance Team in\nBritain winning competitions across\nthe country for a number of years.\nTwo factors contribute to their consistent success. The first is the amazing dedication of the dancers\ninvolved whose long hours of practice are paid off with excellent competition results. The second is the\nsuperb coaching of Dorothy Charlton\n(Modern) and Vicky Cunniffe\n(Latin-American). Thank you for all\nyour hard work and patience. Sadly,\nat the end of this year we lose some\nof our senior members to bigger and\nbetter things. Jo and company -You'll be missed.\nAnother sports editorial\nWith a two-one win against\nHolloway on Wednesday, ICFC\nfirsts could still be crowned league\nleaders if they win their last match of\nthe season.\nThe fencers and dancers have\nproved again that mighty IC can\ncompete on a national stage, even if\nwe can't win University Challenge\ntwo years on the trot.\nSwashbuckling swordsman\nslash to victory\nA lot of people have accused the\nfencing club of being rather arrogant\nthis year. Which is fair enough,\nbecause we are. We have also lived\nup to our own high expectations by\nwinning the BUSA championships\nin Birmingham last Saturday. With\nfoil team pulled off the last 8 fights\nto give Imperial a135 lead going\ninto the e pee, one short of victory.\nThe first fight went to Birmingham,\nbut in the next Henry brought us\nhome with a54 victory to give\nImperial its first title since 1991. We\nvictories over Nottingham, Bradford\nand reigning champions Oxford en\nroute to the finals, we could already\ntaste victory. After the free draw we\nfaced Durham in the semi-finals,\npossibly our biggest threat.\nWith our weakest weapon (e pee) up first, our opponents went 1 -0, and\nthen 2-1 up. From then on, it all\nwent horribly wrong for the northerners [Oi watch it - northern and\nfencing team Sports Ed.], as we took\nthe last 6 e pee fights to lead 7-2\ngoing into the foil. Such is the\nstrength of our foi lists, that the\nBUSA individual champion is the\nweakest member of the team. Hence\nwe rattled off another 9 victories\nwithout breaking into a sweat to take\nus past the 14 wins we needed for\nvictory. So a de moral is ed Durham\ndecided that they would run for\nhome, and conceded the sabre bouts.\nA final score of 25-2 to Imperial.\nIn the final we faced the home\nfavourites, Birmingham, who had\nnarrowly squeezed past the token\nScottish team from Heriot-Watt in\nthe other semi.\nSabre was up first this time, and\nsome good fencing from\nBirmingham restricted us to only a54 lead going into the foil. A minor\nhiccup in the first foil fight let\nBirmingham draw level, but after\nthat we were never in danger as our\ncould now afford to relax, and won\ntwo more fights to leave the final\nscore 16-11 to Imperial.\nIn the absence of club chairman\nReuben Kalam, men's captain Nick\nManton went forward to receive the\ntrophy, together with Henry Morton\nto receive a tankard for fencer of the\ntournament. The team for the finals\nwas: -Foil - Henry \"Mad Dog\" Morton,\nEddie \"Crazy Legs\" Rysdale, David\n\"Damage\" Davidge (who remained\nunbeaten all season)\nEpee - Nigel \"Old Geezer\"\nDavies, Henry \"Mad Dog\" Morton,\nEddie \"Crazy Legs\" Rysdale, Phil\n\"Perry\" Miller\nSabre - Thorsten \"Sebastian\"\nMeyer, Mo \"Mr. Animal\" Mansoori,\nNick \"Ray\" Manton\nAlso, thanks must go to Sarah\nCorneille for organising the week-end, and especially to Duncan\nTindall for giving up his weekend to\ndrive us to Birmingham, and supporting us without a clue as to what\nwas going on!\nDon't worry BUSA, we'll fix the\ntrophy before next year, its only in\nthree bits, and the cup can be hammered back into shape - we'll have\nour passing skills improved by then\nas well.\nIf we still have any money left, we\nwant to go on a tour this year.\n\n"

    "content": "14 POLITICAL FEATURE FELIX WEDNESDAY19 TH MARCH Mike Dumigan from\nthe Liberal Democrats\nWhat sort of background do you come from?\nI was born in Northern Ireland, near Belfast,\nLisburn, a town which is where the army are stationed in Northern Ireland. I spent a fair part my\nyouth in the west [of Ireland], Swinford, Co.\nMayo. The reason why I don't have a particularly\ngood Belfast accent is that any time I wasn't going\nto school in Belfast, I was off in Mayo.\nWhere did you go to school in Belfast?\nIt was LaSalle, which is just off the Falls Road, not\na particularly gentle and easy going place. Sort of\nJesuitical brothers, it was quite a tough schooling.\nAnd then QUB [Queens University, Belfast] studied genetics, and then on without any break to do\nan MBA in Manchester Business School.\nAnd what have you done since then?\nThen I 've worked for a living. In advertising agencies and design consultancies and marketing con-sultan cie s. That's my\nlivelihood, so I 've been\ndoing that for ten years,\nslightly longer.\nHow long have you lived\nin the constituency then?\nFor 8-10 years, so apart ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^\nfrom two years in Manchester I 've lived in\nLondon, and always interestingly enough in the\nconstituency. Well the interesting thing about the\nadvertising world is that it's all centred around the\nwest end, up as far as Paddington, but never as far\nas the East End. So you can be in every single one\nof the top twenty agencies and never leave the con-st it u en cy. What about in the constituency itself, have you\nbeen active in the constituency?\nYes I 've been Chairman of the constituency party\nof the Liberal Democrats for a few years. I 've\nstood for a local Council seat, and I wasn't successful in a seat where there has traditionally been\na strong Tory majority.\nYou still obviously take a very strong interest in\nthe local council?\nWell, a constituency MP needs to understand what\nlocal issues are. So if the local electorate are\nallegedly being defrauded of seven million pounds,\nthen whatever your position in public life you\nshould be concerned about it. Particularly if you\nhappen to be a student and are concerned about\nlack of spending in education, it should be of interest that seven million quid is being pissed away\nsomewhere else.\nDo you regard the Dearing Commission as an\nattempt to take third level education off the\npolitical agenda?\nWell I think the fact that it's reporting after the\ngeneral election is clearly an attempt to take tertiary education off the agenda until after that, and\nthat the Conservatives see is advantageous to them.\nEqually I think Labour sees a great advantage to\ntheir party. They have refused to put forward to\nincrease spending on tertiary level education, or\n\" it should be of interest that seven million quid is being pissed away\" indeed on education at any level, and do not\nhave any precise plans on tertiary level e duca tion. So yes I think the fact that Ron Dearing\nwill report after the General Election is very\nmuch or was very much a political decision.\nAnd what about your party's submission to\nthe commission, what approach did it take?\nWell as a party we have a view that tertiary\neducation is vitally important. We do think our\napproach is new in that we think that there are\nthree sources of funding for tertiary level edu-cation, one is government, two is employers or\nfuture employers, and three is the student body\nand we think that all three have a contribution\nto make. It's significantly different [to\nLabour's proposals] in that education in tertiary level will remain completely free under\nall the Liberal Democrats proposals, but for subsistence, accommodation etc.\nwe believe that students\nmay be making a contribution themselves and that\nwould be funded, rather\nthan the government system where the funding is\nNo I wouldn't,I think it's absolutely a key priority.\nPolitics is about balances you cannot say that educating a three year old is more important that educating a seven year old, which is more important\nthan educating a seventeen year old or a twenty\nyear old, because you have to educate that person\nthrough their life. So if we bolster up one area of\neducation, because we take that what I call the\nholistic approach we're naturally bolstering up the\nrest, otherwise there is a weak link.\nDoes your party or do you personally have any\npreference as to reinstating the Science and\nTechnology Minister to Cabinet level?\nI'm not absolutely certain we have a view on that.\nMy personal view is that science, technology and\ninformation technology is absolute key to the\nfuture success of this country and also key to\nempowering of individuals. This country I think\nfails miserably in the investment it puts into science and technology and I do think that governments should play a much\n' We have Stated that We'll Spend stronger role into trying to bolster those areas and if that\nan extra \u00a32b non education\" means the Minister in Cabinet\n' hp n personally I'm all in\nthrough high street banks, through a government\nbody and that would be paid back from people's wages as a percentage of that so that if you're not\nworking you're not paying back, so it's only paid\nback when some can afford to pay back, when\nthey're earning at a high enough rate to do so.\nWould you accept that there aren't really major\ndifference between you and Labour?\nNo, I think there are fundamental differences, I think the fact we have stated that we'll spend an\nextra \u00a32bn on education and some of that will be\nspent on tertiary education and that's a commitment we make is a real difference.\nWhere Labour do\nnot make any\nactual financial.\ncommitment and do not state their policies with\nany detail then you take the risk, it's like the lot-te ry. You've committed to spend an extra \u00a32bn, you've haven't committed to spend any precise\namount of money on existing third level e duca tion, is that correct?\nWe have committed to spend part of those additional revenues we gain on tertiary education, we\njust haven't set a sum, not to my knowledge, it may\nbe that our education spokesman has done something in the last few days that I'm unaware of.\nYou've got your pre-primary you've got your\nexisting primary and secondary, and you've got\nyour extra adult education?\nWe make a commitment to each of those areas.\nYou've got at least four priorities there before\nyou get on to the existing tertiary structure, so\nyou would accept that the existing tertiary\nstructure is not exactly very high up?\nfavour of it.\nSo you are personally in favour?\nMm.\nBut your party you don't think has a position\non the matter?\nI'm genuinely unsure.\nWith the Liberal Democrats coming third in this\narea in 1992, Mr Dumigan denied that he had no\nchance of winning the seat and emphasised that\nhe didn 't want people to vote tactically in this con\nst it u en cy. He went on to say that he would \"pro b ably\" be contesting the next general election in\nthe same constituency and insisted that this was\nthe only seat where had sought to be the Liberal\nDemocrat candidate. On hearing that his Labour\nopponent had tried \"two or three\" other constituencies he suggested that Ms Green could be\ndescribed as a \"carpet b agger\". "

They then led their bemused\nvictims to the bar, where they proceeded to ply them\nwith beer and sand-wi che s. The unsuspecting Mr Allsop\narrived late, but was\nmet by the same\nfate.\nKenny Roberts,\nKCL SU Vice\nPresident, later\ncommented: \"We would like\nto stress that\nnone of them\nwere tied up\nor treated brutally in any\nway. It was a typical rag\nweek joke, and\ndidn't cause any harm to those\ninvolved. In fact, I think most of us\nenjoyed it quite a lot!\"\nThose present greeted the whole\nincident in the spirit with which it\nwas intended and were promptly\nreleased when their respective\nCollege Unions begrudgingly paid\nthe \u00a350 ransom demands. KCLSU is\nreported to have made a grand total of\n\u00a3200 for their nominated charities, a princely sum for an afternoon's drinking. Later, Eric Allsop described\nthe jape as \"poorly timed but well\nconstructed.\" He went on to comment\nthat \"I was treated adequately; as in\naccordance with the Geneva\nConvention.\"\nDespite a specific personal invitation to the fictitious meeting in the\nfax, University of London Union\nPresident, Sarah White, failed to fall\nfor the fundraising stunt. Presumably\nMs White learnt her lesson last year\nwhen, as ICU President, she was kidnapped by St Mary's Rag in a similar\nincident. Although the then President\nwas missing for over 24 hours, noone at ICU noticed until they\nrecieved the ransom demand.\nC& GCU Election results\nNEWS TEAM The City & Guilds College Union\nexecutive elections took place last\nweek, with the results announced on\nFriday evening.\nVivake Bhalla beat off stiff competition from four other candidates to\nwin the race for President after five\nrounds of counting, with Aku Patel\nacceding to the position of VicePresident.\nSoren Dymond will be Honorary\nJunior Treasurer, following his surprise victory over Akshay Shah, who\nseemed assured of victory until a third round count awarded the vast\nmajority of New Election's reallocated votes to Mr Dymond. Mansoor\nAhmed was returned as\nEntertainments Officer, narrowly\nachieving the quota to beat his opponent on the first round.\nCandidates for the three other\nC& GCU executive positions were\nopposed only by New Election, with\nHamish Common becoming\nGuildsheet Editor, Hannah Pearson\nreturning to the executive next year\nas C&GC Association Representative, and Selina VinayagaPavan elected by the largest majority\nof any candidates Publicity Officer.\nA total of 350 votes were cast at\nballot boxes in six departments\naround the campus, representing\nroughly a tenth of those eligible to\nvote and an increase of 27% over the\nnumber of votes cast last year. This\nrelatively high turnout comes in the\nwake of the success of this year's ICU sabbatical elections, where 17%\nof the electorate expressed a prefer-en ce. One concern for students\ncounting the votes was the number of\nspoilt papers, with around a fifth of\nthe ballot papers filled out incorrectly in some departments.\nThe present executive were reported to be pleased with the number of\npeople standing for positions, the\nhighest in recent years, and with the\nnumber of people voting.\nThey look forward to an active\nyear for City and Guilds College\nUnion, and invite anyone who is\ninterested in working on the team to\nget in contact with them via the C&G Office.\nULU Election results\nNEWS TEAM At UL U Council on Monday night,\nthe four sabbatical officers who will\nrepresent the University of London's82000 students next year were elect-ed.\nFirst up were the two candidates\nfor President, where Siva\nGaneshanandan (this year's General\nSecretary at Royal Holloway Union),\nbeat off Mark Pursey (ULU Chair\nand UCL sabbatical at UCL), winning by 40 votes to 33. Both candidates seized upon the need to act fast\nto secure London Transport discount\ncards for UL U students, before privatisation takes place. Both candidates promised to oppose any threat\nof fees or top-up charges, Mr Pursey\nrepeatedly stating his success in\nkeeping fees out of the UCL pro spec tus. Neither candidate put forward\nany scheme which they would definitely support, and followed each\nother in expressing the need for UL U to take a greater role in the NUS,\ndrawing cries of 'shame' from the IC\ndelegation.\nThere was very little difference\nbetween the two candidates, and\nquestions from the floor did little to\ndraw a distinction as only three questions were permitted by the\nReturning Officer.\nImperial's own Jo Paice stood\nunopposed for the position of Vice\nPresident (Finance & Services) and\nbeat off the New election challenge\nby 36 to 25. She promised to give\ngreater financial accountability, a greater return on the investment\nwhich College Unions put into U1,U, more resources for sports and societies and smaller Colleges, and more\nforward planning to allow UL U to\nwork alongside, rather than in competition with, constituent Colleges\nand Unions.\nElsewhere, Dan Brown combated\nthe (non-existent) New-Election\nchallenge, wining by 41 votes to 16\nto take the post of Vice President\n(Sports & Societies) for 97/98, and\nSam Parham won the role of VP( Welfare & Representation) 30-29\nafter the first reallocation of votes,\nhaving tied 29-29 with Mark Hill on\nthe first count.\n^^^WWANjT^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX WEDNESDAY19 TH MARCH POLITICAL FEATURE 13\nKate Green (extreme left) at Imperial College supporting last December's AUT led strike\nWhat background do you come from, professionally and educationally?\nI was educated in Scotland and went to university\nin the end in Edinburgh, where I graduated in law,\nwhich is absolutely no use down here at all because\nit's Scots law and it's completely different, and\nthen I came down to London to work for Barclays.\nWhat about prior to university?\nI lived in Midloathian which is in Scotland, south-em Scotland, went to school in, well you won't heard of it, a place called Currie.\nFrom a political point of view, where do you\ncome from?\nI 've been involved on and off over the years in pol-it ics, and certainly in this constituency, in the\nCities of London and Westminster, for about the\nlast five or six years since I came back to live in\nLondon.\nYou haven't stood as a councillor?\nNo, no I haven't. By way of background, I live in\nthe City of London personally, the City, we have\nput Labour candidates up from time to time but the\nCity Corporation is a very odd political animal\nwhich effectively doesn't organise on party lines.\nSo you do actually live in the constituency?\nI live in the constituency yeah, and I work in it as\nwell. I work in Westminster for Barclays Bank.\nI 've been in Westminster\nfor about nine months, I was at Piccadilly Circus\nfor two or three years\nbefore that, and for years\nDo you see the future as a revamped student\nloans system, or as a graduate tax?\nI'm not sure what you would call it, I think that it's unrealistic now to expect that a system of grants is\ngoing to be sufficient, but it's very important that\nwe structure a repayment programme to the time\nwhen they are best able to make the repayments.\nSurely there are quite significant differences\nfrom a National Insurance led system where\nyou pay for your lifetime, and having fixed\namount to pay back?\nI think you've got to \u2014\nbother about how it's look at something which \"I'm Very OppOSed tO top Up fees\" funded for the future,\nis in between the two Will Labour reinstate\nNew\nLabour's Kate Green\nand universities and start taking parts?\nAnd getting some sort of credit for them, now\nthat's going to require a quite radical big thinking\nfor institutions that have traditionally really only\nhad to think within their own operation.\nWasn't the Dearing Commission an attempt to\ntake third level education funding off the political agenda, and didn't the Labour Party collude\nin this?\nI'm not sure whether that was the reason it was set\nup, I don't think you can take tertiary education\nfunding out of the political agenda, it matters far\ntoo much to too many people and there's too much\nmoney in it.\nSo you wouldn't say that it is an attempt, a fairly crude attempt, to put it off the agenda?\nI hope it isn't,I'd be very, very dismayed if it were,\nand I'd be ashamed, and I would think that it would\nbe a real betrayal of the next generations, for those\nof us who've been lucky enough to get that education to sit back and say oh we're not really going to\nhow\n\"I work in Westminster for\nBarclays Bank\"\nbefore that in the Head Office, which is in the City.\nWhere do you stand on the funding of third\nlevel education, how do you see the future?\nFirst of all I'm very opposed to top up fees, and I will carry on taking that position. I don't think the\ncurrent student loans system is working at all, it's loading up huge debts for students which they then\nhave to pay off over a very short period really. And\nI think that's deterring particularly less well off\nfamilies from going into education, and I think it's also very important that institutions aren't put in a position where they're competing against one\nanother either for research monies or to attract the\nbest students.\notherwise for example \"\"\nyou're penal ising people who take more expensive\ncourses or who take a longer course, so that architects for example would be paying back a lot more\nthan people on three year courses in perhaps the\nArts or something. But I don't think that it's fair\neither to say to students that you've got this indefinite burden for life, if you're genuinely talking\nabout recouping the cost of supporting them during\ntheir education you can't say you've got to pay that\nback for ever and ever until your income dries up.\nIn the Labour Party's submission to Dearing\nthey seemed to outline a plan for a learning\nbank, how long would it\ntake to put it into place?\nI think it's something they\nwould want to try to do\nH reasonably quickly. I don't think that there's any intention, that there\nwon't be undergraduates going through university\nprogrammes, post-graduate programmes and so\non.\nSo it could be quite some years before undergraduate degrees at Imperial are for instance\npart of that?\nI guess what will happen is that bits of them will\nget into it before other bits, so you might say there\nare parts, especially degrees at Imperial I would\nimagine, bits that are very vocational or very technical that could be really closely allied to people's perhaps technical on the job training, obviously at\na fairly high level.\nSo you might start going through the colleges\nthe Science and\nTechnology Minister to Cabinet? '\nGosh I don't know, I really haven'ta clue, but I mean I think, we've got to have a huge commitment to making the importance of science and\ntechnology much more visible.\nSo you didn't think it was a problem taking the\nOST [Office of Science and Technology] within\nthe DTI [Department of Trade and Industry]?\nI'm not sure that I 've got a really strong view one\nway or another. I do think it's very, very important\nto get the profile raised. We need to look at all the\nways we can of raising that, and that might well\nmean considering whether we've got the organisation within the government itself right.\nDo you accept that there's realistically no possibility that Labour is going to win this seat?\nDo the Tories have any safe seats? I 'll say to you\nquite openly, Labour is targeting first of all those\nseats which we must take to get a decent majority\nin Parliament, and in the order of those seats which\nwe must take, Cities of London and Westminster is\nfairly low down.\nWas this the only constituency where you\napplied to be a candidate?\nNo I applied to a few others, two or three not very\nmany. I was really quite focused because it's a very\ntime consuming process and I wanted to learn how\nto do it.\n\n"

    "content": "16 CAPITAL PUNISHMENT FELIX WEDNESDAY19 TH MARCH String\nOn the 28th of October 1965, a Private Member's Bill received\nRoyal Assent, abolishing the death\npenalty for murder in the United\nKingdom. It had originally been\nabolished in the 11th Century by\nWilliam the Conqueror, and was\nthen reinstated by his son William\nRufus. Hangings in England\nreached a peak during the reign of\nEdward VI in the 1550s, when on\naverage, one person was executed\nevery day. The death penalty could\nbe imposed by magistrates, and\nhangings were often carried out on\nvillage greens.\nIn the 1970s, the Supreme Court in\nthe United States declared the death\npenalty constitutional, reinstating it\nafter a period of absence. In Britain,\nall major political parties have\ncommitted themselves to not reinstating the death penalty, and it is\nconsidered politically very dangerous to support it. In contrast, the\nrate of executions are rising in the\nUSA, with 38 of the 50 states\nallowing for it. Usual methods\ninclude hanging, electrocution,\nlethal injection, gas chamber and\nfiring squad, with some countries,\nnotably ones observing Sharia\n(Islamic Law) beheading, amputating and stoning prisoners. More\nimaginative methods of dispensing\nwith prisoners include cannibalism\n(practised in Africa), Necklacing (a rubber tire placed around the neck\nand set alight), and the 'Thousand\nCuts' (being lashed to death), practised in China. Historical methods\nof execution and torture include\nbeing boiled alive (used against\npoisoners in medieval England),\nbeing buried alive, burnt at the\nstake (to purify the soul, apparent-ly), eaten by animals, flayed, drawn\nand quartered, impaled (but only\nthrough non-vital organs), being\nput on the Iron Chair/Bed (which\nwas then put on the fire), the Iron\nMaiden (female effigies, hollowed\nout, with spikes inside: prisoners\nwere 'embraced' by the Maiden),\ncrucifixions (originally done from\ntrees), drowning, being blown from\na cannon, the pendulum (read\nEdgar Allan Poe?), poison, press-ing, rack, sawn in half, death by\ninsects (popular with Native\nAmericans against troublesome set-tl ers), shot by arrows (popular with\nthe Vikings), the Wooden Horse\n(you don't want to know), starvation (France had ou b liet tes who\nwere imprisoned and 'forgotten\nabout.'), garrotte, thrown from a great height, and the Cauldron (you\nwant to know about this one even\nless). There are plenty of international treaties banning such horrific\npunishments, but it makes me feel\nvery happy to have been born in the\nlate 20th Century!\nThe death penalty is still in force\nin the United Kingdom for the military offences of mutiny, failure to\nsuppress mutiny, obstructing operations and assisting the enemy, plus\nthe joint civilian and military\noffence of treason (itself a very\nwide definition of crimes, including\ndamaging military property or murdering a judge). No-one has been\nexecuted in the UK since 1963.\nAccording to Amnesty\nInternational, 2331 prisoners were\nexecuted last year (the actual figure\nis believed to be much higher), with\nChina scooping the prize with 1791\nexecutions, 77% of the world's total. Only five countries executed\njuveniles in the last few years: Iran,\nPakistan, Saudi Arabia, the United\nStates and Yemen, with the USA\nexecuting more than any other.\nThe death penalty will forever\nremain one of the most controversial world-wide political issues,\nalthough its media exposure in\nBritain is reduced. One of the most\ncontroversial executions in recent\nyears was that of Jesse DeWayne\nJacobs, who was executed in Texas\nin January last year, with the vic-tim's family, and the original prosecutor and court judge protesting\nhis innocence. The Supreme Court\nruled that it could not overturn the\noriginal jury's verdict. This even\nmanaged to evoke a response from\nthe Vatican, which described it as\n\"monstrous and absurd\".\nUnder European Union Law, the\ndeath penalty is now banned in all\nstates unless in times of emergency.\nThis has been the case with British\nLaw for many years, since the military offences are only capital 'in\nthe face of the enemy', and the\ndeath penalty would only be sought\nfor treason in the most dire cases.\nProponents of the death penalty\ncite law and order, and the increasing crime rate as reasons for its justified existence. It is considered the\nbest absolute sanction by the State\nagainst the truly evil.\nWe conducted a survey of your\nviews, results opposite. Please\nwrite and tell us your opinions.\nHAMISH\nSums\n\n"

Many people find this\nunacceptable, but this does not mean\nthat although all other public office\nmay be fought over in whatever\nunscrupulous and vulgar manner the\npoliticians see fit, the highest office\nof all is above the dishonour able means so often employed in the\ngame of politics. I see this as an\nopportunity for te monarchy to\nrestrain the excesses of grasping\npoliticians and to protect the people\nfrom their various forms of corr up tion, whilst in no way interfering\nwith the legislative process.\nHistorically, the monarchy has done\nmuch to protect the people from the\nexcesses of Parliament often suffering for it. In a republic, the head of\nstate would most likely be another\nConservative politician intent on lining his own pocket.\nYours sincerely,\nPaul Squires\nDespite failing to live up to its\npromise of expelling the tired and\npainful clich es that surround the\nmonarchy debate, I find your letter intriguing as it casts the Queen\nas squeaky clean against the grubby common politicians. This is\nviewpoint is rather too simplistic,\nhowever I do not have the time to\nadequately discuss this issue,\nmaybe next term!\ngreen green grass\nDear Felix,\nWith spring fast approaching, I have been looking forward to the\ndays in the summer term when the\nQueen's Lawn becomes the place to\ngo for a quick fix of greenery and\nsunshine (or shade!). As a result, I was more than a little perturbed to\nsee an item on \"Queen's Lawn and\nDalby Court\" on page 5 of that\naugust organ of propaganda aimed at\nthe alumni, IC Matters.\nThis article suggests that not only\nare college looking forward eagerly\nto the transformation of the Queen's Lawn into some sort of bizarre water\npark, but they also plan to turn Dalby\nCourt into a car park, and put a landscaped terrace on top.\nAs far as I can tell, this means no\nmore grass for us students to loiter\non. Presumably a few extra benches\nmight be provided, but I can't see\ncollege shelling out for seating for\nhundreds of students.\nThe college is already extremely\nshort of green spaces, and these latest\nplans will, as far as I can tell, leave\nonly one grass verge for those of us\nwho prefer to sit on grass rather than\nconcrete. In addition, both the\nQueen's Lawn and Dalby Court provide a lift to the spirits even when\none is rushing past on the way to the\nlibrary or along the walkway.\nYours sincerely,\nSarah Talbot (comp pg)\nhigh times for all\nDear Sir,\nRe:High Times in last issue\nThe issue of drug \"abuse\" is\nalways clouded with ignorance, disinformation and preconceptions. Not\nmeaning to criticise the authors of the\narticle, it was claimed that all \"safe\ndrugs\" are \"far more dangerous and\naddictive than tobacco and alcohol.\"\nTo the best of my knowledge\ncannabis, amphetamine, LSD and\nMDMA are not physically addictive,\nunlike tobacco and alcohol. People\nmay come to feel that they need the\nmental effects of the drug to face certain situations - psychological addiction - but their bodies will have no\ncravings.\nA few more facts that people\nshould know are: no-one has ever\ndied from taking too much LSD (and\nI would imagine the numbers for\ndeath through cannabis overdose are\nfairly minute); the deaths caused by\nec stacy are nearly all caused through\nheatstroke or drinking too much\nwater rather than from the direct\neffects of the drug (NB - most of the\ndeaths \"caused\" by E are due as\nmuch to the amphetamine that is\noften taken along with it rather than\nthe E itself); it is statistically more\ndangerous to eat your first peanut\nthan take your first E. The article also claimed that legal-ising soft drugs would lead more\npeople to try them (a positive thing in\nmy opinion) and then on to harder\ndrugs. Admittedly if someone is buying soft drugs from a dealer regularly\nthen they may be offered some harder drugs and so a connection may be\narguable, but if that same person is\ngoing to an off-licence to buy the\nsame soft drugs then there will be no\nneed for them to meet anyone who\ncan supply them with hard drugs,\nsurely reducing the chance of further\nexperimentation?\nIn my limited experience, alcohol\ncauses much more social problems\nthan any other drug. If everyone went\nout and did ec stacy instead of getting\npissed then there really would be little need for police to patrol the streets\nlooking to stop violence as there\nwouldn't be any. And people would\nhave a lot more fun.\nDrug addiction is a terrible thing\n(although I have only experienced\nthis through one or two alcoholic\nfriends, and most of the people I know who smoke) and naturally I would not advocate the rampant use\nof all drugs. My standpoint is that if\npeople want a different drug of\nchoice rather than alcohol then it\nshould be available. I have much\nmore to say on this subject but this\nletter is far too long already.\nYours faithfully,\nName withheld by request\nLetters may be edited for length.\nDeadline for letters in Felix 1084\nis Tuesday 22nd April.\nLetters may be e mailed to our\naddress: felix@1c. ac.uk\nVACATION ACCESS TO OTHER HIGHER EDUCATION LIBRARIES\nUndergraduates and postgraduates on taught courses at IC\nwill normally be granted reference use of other university\nlibraries free of charge during the vacations of the host university (under a scheme arranged by SCO NUL the Standing\nConference of National and University Libraries).\nYou should take proof of your current membership of IC, such\nas your current library card.

    "content": "18 COLUMNS FELIX WEDNESDAY19 TH MARCH As regular readers of this column\nwill know, every now and then I get\ncaught with my trousers down.\nStatistically, that is. And so it\nappeared last week following Mike\nHansen's letter. I thought that this\nmight be picked up on, since I was\nless than sure about its veracity, but\nbeing a responsible journalist I thought what the Hell and went\nahead with it. Then, better late than\nnever, I checked it out. Nottingham,\nso their General Office tell me, have\n15,600 students. Figures provided by\nmy friends in the Registry say that\nwe have 7,790 (1995/96). Since\nnumber of students has some bearing\non university size, let's say that they\nare about twice as big as us. Using\nMr Hansen's own figures, since\nNottingham have yet to respond, we\nhave 30% more staff in our Finance\nfunction than an organisation that is\n100% bigger. Make of that, ladies\nand gentlemen, what you will.\nThe highly entertaining series on the\ngreat and the good of IC reached\nPersonnel last week. First rate inter-view, but I suspect that a couple of\nquestions were cut for reasons of\nspace. They might have been the fol-lowing. Firstly, how do you justify a department which consumes over\n\u00a31 million annually and requires 33\nstaff? My limited experience of\nindustry suggest that this is over the\ntop. If this department Ci vy-i/v yi\nhas been rational is ed,I dread to think what\nDr Kimberley inherit-ed; incidentally, I thought restructuring\nwas intended to cut\ncosts not decrease\nworkload. Not content with 33 staff, we\nsee that this number\nwill rise by a third\nwhen the medical\nmergers are comp let ed. This is getting y0j Ce0f ridiculous, particularly when one notes that some of these\nstaff will, if I understand correctly,\nbe handing out P45s to some of the\ntechnical support staff from Mary's lost in the merger. Secondly, why is\nit damned near impossible to remove\nstaff who are clearly incompetent or\nsuperfluous- the only example that\nsprings to mind is the Mary's cashier\nthat half-inched \u00a3650,000. Perhaps I am being a little harsh, since Marion\nKimberley is relatively new in the\njob, and I have every confidence that\nshe will rapidly realise the lunacy of\nwhat was probably handed to her on\nher arrival. Time will tell.\nIncidentally,\nBaker I appreciated, though\ntotally disagreed with,\nthe force of your convictions on the\nmonarchy and the\nhereditary principle.\nSince property lies at\nthe centre of this, I naturally assume that\nyou will not make a will, so as to avoid\ncharges of hypocrisy.\nAway from SW7, it\nwas marvellous to see\nDA/i PAM that my master plan\ntor the welfare state is\nbecoming government policy\n(there's modesty for you). The effective privatisation of pensions will\nensure that we, the first generation to\nbenefit if it comes to fruition, will\nreceive substantially more money\nthan our parents for much less outlay.\nThe net result should be a saving of\nabout \u00a340 billion per year from 2040\nonwards. In today's prices that would\nallow an income tax cut of about 22p. The potential for economic growth\nstemming from this policy is awe-some, and it is good to see such a long-term outlook taken on an issue\nwhich could become very serious if\nleft alone, as is the case in Germany\nand France. The pensions deficit in\nGermany is predicted to be 430% of\nGDP in 40 years, in other words $16\ntrillion. Yet again, we lead and\nEurope follows, as they surely will.\nSome of you will remember that at\ntimes I have been less than charitable\nabout Schal. Unfortunately, those\nwith the best memories all seem to\nwork on the BMS project, so it was\nwith some trepidation that I accepted\nan invitation to look around the site.\nI must say that I was very impressed\nand found it most enjoyable. Thanks\nmust go to Phil Hilton and Oliver\nClarke who gave the tour, but a special mention is in order for the 120+\nmen (and women) currently on the\nsite. An altogether un-motley crew,\nwho resisted numerous opportunities\nto throw me off the top of the build-ing. Without meaning to sound\nincredibly patronising (who, me?),\nthese lot really know the score, with\nthe project on time and to budget, in\nstark contrast to every other IC project in living memory. Shame they're\ngiving it to the medics...\nWestminster Eye - Hamish Common\nAnd now\nfor something completely different. The\narrival of\nthe internet has brought with it political parties of all hues. This has been\na silent revolution to the 95% of the\ncountry who don't have a modem\n(and couldn't care less anyway), but\nhas caused friction on the issue of\ncensorship and the question of jurisdiction over the net.\nOf course, no one country does\nhave jurisdiction: national laws are\nmerely bye-laws covering a small\nportion of the net. What can be done\nis to make it more difficult for\n'unsuitable' material to appear on the\nweb, by putting pressure on Internet\nService Providers, and passing information to the police within the country concerned. This can only have a minor effect, as small well-funded\norganisations can easily move\naround, with the bureaucracy of each\ncountry never quite able to catch up.\nSuch problems have already tied\nmany countries censorship laws in\nknots, which gives a wonderful\nopportunity for this columnist to look\nat some of the good, the bad and dangerously ugly among the political\nlandscape.\nNaturally, the mainstream political\nparties have a professional if rather\nbland presence on the web, accessible at www.conservative-party.org.uk, www.labour.org.uk,\nand www.lib dem s. org.uk. The\nConservative and Labour websites\ndo look worrying ly similar to each\nother, but all three have the usual mix\nof membership information, their\nown spin on major news stories, plus\nvarious other titbits including\nLabour's on-line shop. Smaller parliamentary parties are well represented on the web, including the Scottish\nNational Party, Plaid Cymru (Welsh\nNationalists), and the ubiquitous\nReferendum Party, at\nwww.snp.org.uk, www.plaid-cymru.wales.com, and www.refer-end um. org.uk. The two nationalist\nparties (it is interesting that nothing\ncould be found on Northern Irelandanyone out there know of any?)\ndemand their usual things: self-gov-ern ment, 'improvements to our cul-ture' and so on. Indeed Plaid Cymru\ntriumphantly announces its attempt\nfor Wales to join the United Nations\n- good luck! Finally, the Referendum\nParty witter s on about Europe.\nThe reasons why mainstream\npolitical parties and extremist organisations use the web are different.\nPolitical parties must be seen to up\nwith the latest technology (being old-fashioned is rarely in vogue) and a web site is a good way of doing this.\nThe political benefits are small: only\na tiny number of people have internet\naccess, and are unlikely to change\nallegiance due to a trendy site. It is\nmore a case of not looking a fool in\nfront of other parties by having an\nobviously inferior site, with all the\nunfavourable media attention that\nthat may bring. There was a case in\nDecember last year, when a group\ncalling themselves the Digital\nAnarchists hacked into Labour's web\nsite, replaced Blair's photo with his\nSpitting Image puppet, added links to\nporn sites and generally amused\nthemselves at Labour's expense.\nThe web is a much more powerful\ntool for extremist organisations,\nhowever, and there plenty of them to\nbe found. Given their nature as small\nand often international organisations,\nthe web provides a perfect medium\nfor information and contacts to be\nestablished cheaply and quickly.\nSuch sites include: British National\nParty, at ng ww mall. com/frontier\n/bnp/, Crosstar: www.nationalist.\norg, the New Communist Party of\nGreat Britain, at www.geo cities. com/CapitolHill/2853, and the\nNatural Law Party at www.natural-law-party.org.uk. It is worth noting\nthat these sites are far more sensible -many professionally produced - than\ntheir usual image would suggest. The\nBNP's website informs us that they\ndo not condone violence, and take\ncare to remain within the law regarding racial relations. Digging a little\ndeeper, the racial supremacists' discussion groups are brimming with\nracist ranting, so there is little doubt\nas to the real motives of the parties.\nThe Communist Party's site is a fairly sensible discussion on socialism\nand communism, talking of what\nmight be realistically attainable and\ndiscussing mainstream political\nevents in a socialist light.\nAlthough the web is only a minor\npart of political debate - newspapers\nand television and infinitely more\npowerful tools for publicity - it is an\ninteresting one. It is not only a medium for publicity but the subject of\nmuch publicity itself, partly due to\nsome of the organisations listed\nabove. It may not necessarily do\nmuch to further political debate,\nsince you are only exposed to one\nopinion at a time, but it does allow\nyou to look at the issues rather than\nthe sound bites and the smiles. There\nis some interesting, boring, verbose\nand quite sickening material around,\nbut for a change the content is more\nimportant than the packaging.\n\n"

Within this area will be the\nphones, faxes, pigeonholes, noticeboards, photo-copiers, PC's anything to make\nrunning a club easier. An administrator will be appointed to assist you\nwith all the information on sporting\nfixtures, including details of games,\nlocality, transport and recording of\nresults, and information packs on\nhow to do things (like budgets and\nevents) will be available.\nThe centre will come on-line on\nApril 21st, and will be accessed\nthrough the first floor Union\nReception area. This will also have\nundergone refurbishment in order to\nprovide better access to the centre\nand the staff working for you in the\noffices. The current information packs, room\nbookings and minibus hiring services will remain.\nTHE UNION SHOP\nOur sorrow at no longer being able to sell you\nbooks is tempered somewhat with expectation\nbecause - in its place from April 21st will be\n'The Union Shop\". Its going to be a 'totally new\nshopping experience' of a place, designed to be\nthe equal of any high street stationers, and will sell\nan extended range of stationery, clothing, computer consumables, and regalia. The exciting design\nis a product of intense consultation between the\ndesigners, students, Union staff and sabbaticals,\nand (hyperbole aside) its going to be great.\nADVICE CENTRE & REPRESENTATION\nThe Union Advice Centre continues to give aid\nand information to students who need help, c it her through course, housing or other problems. This\nyear private sector accommodation problems have\nbeen very much at the fore, and the Union has\nbeen pressing the College to take a more active\nand protective role in this for the vast majority of\nits students who do not live in hall.\nMembers of the Union Welfare Committee also\ntook part in a seminar attended by senior tutors\nand College staff where they highlighted issues\nrelating to sexual harassment and discrimination.\nThey raised the need for a College harassment\npolicy and a clearer framework for settling problems between students and staff.\nCAREERS FAIR\nOver 2000 students attended November's Careers fair - the biggest union held fair in the\ncountry. Companies from all over Europe participated, as the reputation of both the college and the\nfair itself have spread, so students were able to\ninterrogate a broad range of would-be employees\nface to face, and find out for themselves (mostly\nfrom ex-IC graduates) what working for a particular company would really be like.\nSO, YOU'VE ALL SEEN THE POSTERS:\n\"YOUR UNION WORKING FOR YOU\"\nBUT WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?\nWHAT EXACTLY HAS THE UNION\nDONE THIS YEAR, WHAT DOES IT\nINTEND TO DO, AND HOW DOES IT\nAFFECT YOU ANYWAY?\nlunchtime by hungry students. Some of the congestion should be hopefully solved by serving curries them from a separate dispenser in dB's next\nyear, and leaving the main outlet to dispense the\nother great value meals we produce, but again we\nwait with bated breath for some extra space to\ncarry out the Grand Expansion Masterplan.\nOne aspect of catering often overlooked is functions, of which the most notable this year was the\nACC Colours Dinner, a medieval style banquet\nthoroughly enjoyed by all.\nENTS\nA much more balanced programme has seen a more successful Ents programme, packing out\nevery Friday night this year. The start of the year\nsaw the opening of dBs, which was a huge\nimprovement on the old Ents lounge, and the\nimprovement has been rewarded with high attendance not only for club nights but\nalso for the Bust-A Gut Comedy\nClub. Next term promises no slacking in pace with Bust-A Gut playing\nhost to the Open Mic semi finals,\nwith Boothby Graffoe, and Charlie\nChuck. There will also be more live\nmusic, plus the Summer Carnival\nwill be the Carnival to end all\nCarnivals.\nBARS\nBoth DaVinci's and the Union Bar have had\nhugely successful years, and continue to improve\ntheir service by increasing their range of real ales,\nand cocktails, as well as introducing new products\nwhen suggested. The bar has benefited significantly from a raised profile in the college, and\nshould hopefully become less of a sticking point\non a Friday night with a nice new floor (again,\nbeing done over Easter). One of the bars biggest\nsuccesses has been the UDH Cocktail Bar, which\ncame about through a students suggestion, and\nregularly attracts a few hundred up there on bigger\nnights. Congestion has become a problem, simply\ndue to our immense popularity, and we can only\nhope for extra space to expand the venue when\nBiology move out in '98 (and the Medics move\nin).\nCATERING\nThe ubiquitous \u00a31 curry continues to go from\nstrength to strength, again causing problems with\nover popularity. The summer refurbishment of\ndB's seems to have paid off in spades - the extra\nseating area thus generated is packed every\nSTAFF TRAINING\nICU has a policy of employing student staff wherever possible, thus\ngenerating jobs for financially\nembarrassed students, as well as a lecture friendly job timetable. We are committed\nto training all the students we employ, and many\nhave benefited from this by attending courses covering everything from first aid to customer care.\nThis years training and induction day was attended by around 150 students.\nOf course it hasn't all been good news this year:\nthe loss of our book selling operation has tied our\nfinances closer to those of the college which - con\nside ring the state of higher education funding - is\nnot a position we relish (in real terms our sub ven tion from College was greatly reduced last year)\nand the withdrawal of College funding for the\nCommemoration Ball has placed the event in\njeopardy for the first time in 48 years. There are\nalso threats from College's plans for Beit Quad\n(involving a big conference centre and a small\nUnion), and other plans that are under discussion\nmay impact on your life as a student.\nFortunately (this is the cheerful bit) you have us\nto fight on your behalf, and in perfect honesty (and\neven if we do say so ourselves) our Union is one\nof the best in the country, and an ego like that\nneeds support and nurturing.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX WEDNESDAY19 TH MARCH NEWS 7\nIC's 'secret garden' no longer a mystery\nThe secretive Prince's Gate Gardens can be seen on this ariel photograph of the South Kensington site, behind\nWeeks Hall, up and to the left of the familiar dome of the Albert Hall. The garden, larger than the adjacent\nPrince's Gardens was purchased in the middle of last year to \"provide a quality quiet garden area for the academic community to enjoy.\"\nthan a week later, a Felix reporter\nreentered the garden to study (it is\nmuch quieter than Kensington\nGardens, being virtually unknown to\nall but residents of Weeks Hall), only\nto find the gate locked and the gardens full of school children.\nThe garden is bordered by several\nproperties that, although they do not\nown it, have legal rights set out in the\ndeeds to the properties for access to\nthe garden. In return, subscribers pay\nan amount towards the upkeep of the\ngarden. The school involved is the\nMontessori St Nicholas Centre,\nwhich is situated on Princes Gate, to\nthe north of the garden. Mr Caldwell\nstated that, though they have a right\nto use the garden, this does not\nextend to the children using the gardens as a playground. The children\nwere using the garden in such a way\nthat any other users would be prevented from enjoying quiet contemplation, in clear contravention of the\n\"rules\" stated on boards in the gar-den. The College, according to Mr\nCaldwell, \"are not very happy at this\nand are taking it up in pretty tough\nterms with them.\"\nA spokesman for the Montessori\nschool said that the pupils are always\nunder supervision when using the\ngarden, and never do so in large\ngroups. He said that the school was\npleased to learn that IC had bought\nthe garden, as they felt that the\nCollege would protect the garden,\nand the rights of those who own the\nproperties around it. The school\nspokesman went on to suggest that\nthe previous owners of the garden\nhad been dissatisfied with the\nschool's use of the garden, but there\nwas nothing that they could do about\nit, the rights of access being guaranteed in the deeds. He also claimed\nthat IC had thus far been amicable in\ntheir attitude towards the school, but\nadmitted that the College were\nunhappy with regards to the school's use of the gardens.\nThe gardens should now open for\nthe College community to use.\nStudents are advised that to gain\nentry, they should use the gate to the\neast of Week's hall, and follow the\npath.\nThis newly-constructed path was\nitself the subject of some controversy\nlast year, as building work disrupted\nthe residents of Weeks during the\nexam revision period.\n'Student Affairs' Sabbatical to join gang of four\nMATTHEW BENNETT\nImperial College has run into problems regarding its acquisition of\nPrince's Gate gardens, the \"secret\ngarden\" behind Weeks Hall.\nThe garden was bought by the\nCollege last year for an undisclosed\nsum of money, rumoured to be in the\nmillions, from the widows of the previous owners. The reasons for the\npurchase were set out by Ian\nCaldwell, head of Estates: \"...To provide a quality quiet garden area for\nthe academic community to enjoy,\nwith a relatively natural habitat in the\nmiddle of our hard urban campus...\nAs a strategic purchase to project the\nCollege's long term interests for\ndeveloping the Sports Centre site and\n8 to 15 Princes Gardens.\"\nMr Caldwell went on to deny suggestions that the college had plans to\nbuild anything on top of the garden,\nadmitting that \"the planners are\nunlikely to support this anyway\".\nThe possibility of extending the\nsports centre under the gardens has\nbeen examined, but studies concluded it would be more cost effective to\nbuild under the tennis courts.\nHowever, Mr Caldwell has suggested that the gardens could be open via\nswipe card access to all members of\nthe college. Initial investigations by\nFelix found this not to be the case,\nwith only residents of Weeks hall\nbeing allowed into the garden via the\nhall, and the path by the side of\nWeeks. Once access was gained\n(thanks to a Weeks resident), we discovered that the newly a qui red part\nof the garden was padlocked, and the\nonly way in was through a hole in the\nfence.\nAfter Felix contacted Mr Caldwell\nfor a second time, the swipe card machine now permits access for all\nstudents to the garden during the\nspecified opening hours (9am6 pm). The gate was also un padlocked. The\ngardens were at last open to the\nCollege community for \"quiet study\nand contemplation\". However, less\ncontinued from front page\nAlex Feakes, another of ICU's four\nsabbaticals, questioned Mr Pursey as\n\"expert witness\" on the usefulness of\nthe proposal since UCL's Students'\nUnion has, at present, five sabbaticals. Mr Pursey explained that UCL students had recently discussed the\npossibility of moving from five to six\nsabbaticals for similar reasons, but\nhad come to the conclusion that it\nwasn't another sabbatical they needed but more union staff at an administrative level. Such permanent staff\nshould filter out day-to-day matters\nand paperwork, thus reducing the\nsabbaticals workload and leaving\nthem the time to concentrate on policy issues.\nThis system is currently being\nintroduced at UCLSU and has\nproven effective. ICU Council recognised the value of permanent staff\nand agreed that this would have to be\na long term project. Ms Corneille\nadded that she has already reorganised the Union Office's staff, so that\nnext year's Deputy President would\nhave a 'clubs and societies administrator' to help her.\nAfter some discussion, Council\nvoted in favour of the proposal to\ncreate a new post but agreed that\nmuch planning is needed before\nimplementation. ICU must also take\nsteps to secure funding for any new\nmembers of staff. Any change in the\nnumber of ICU sabbaticals must be\napproved by the Governing Body.\n\n"
