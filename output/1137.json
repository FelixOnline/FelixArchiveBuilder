    "content": "22 Clubscene 22 February 1999\nTiymp\nNymph @ Mass\nSt. Matthew's Church, SW2. Monthly( sec-on d Saturday), \u00a310/\u00a312/\u00a314,10pm6 am, capacity = 1,000. Dress code none, but make an effort.\nAnother month and another stunning night at Nymph. I won't goon about this\nagain 'cos we did a review of it in\nDecember, but I had to put it in 'cos I really want to urge you all to go along( again and again!). It might not have\nbeen as packed out as on our last jaunt\nto Nymph, but this didn't really matter -it was still a top night out. And that's a sign of how good the night is - it still\nimpresses even when it isn'trammed. Personally it was very chilled to go lo a night where you could actually move around without any hassles and where you got the chance and space to strut\nyour stuff on the stage without the risk\nof getting pushed off by some fat ass!\nAnd that is precisely where I decided to\nspend most of the night - on the stage\nin the back room. This was the place to\nbe. The tunes were consistently good. Top bang in', bouncy, nu-energy laden\nbeats, with lots of tracks from the Seb\nFontaine/Tony de Vit \"Elements\" album, and even some old favourites like DJ Misjah's \"Access.\" It's great when the sort of music you're into at the mo comes up\nagain and again at a club - there's nothing better than dancing to songs you know, now is there? Shit, there were even some a mus in gravers around with\nfluorescent tops, glowing sticks, and bike\nlights in the pockets of their combat trousers (!) Why the fuck they were trying to impersonate KIT from KnightRider\nis anybody' s guess, but at least they\nbrought a smile to the faces of the more cynical punters in the club. Thankfully\nthere were only two of those cheese mongers around the rest of the people\nin Nymph dress pretty well and aren't fro-mage-led in any way. In fact they are one of the nicest crowds around. The main room was a bit more packed out, but I 've got to say that this\ntime the music was a bit uninspiring\ndespite of (or perhaps because of, I supp os e) the presence of some big gish names in DJ Pierre and Marshall Jefferson. One friend described it as \"light\njazz\" by the end of the night, but his\nbrain had been twisted by the hard beats\nof the back room, amongst other things.\nStill the crowd seemed to enjoy the main\narena, so it must have been passable.\nNext month( Saturday 13th March)\nsees some really big names descending on the Nymph camp in the forms of\nJustin Robertson (big Club UK DJ and fi on Rock guy), and lar ley Jackmaster\nFunk. After a tiny lull in Feb I reckon that\nthis one will be absolutely heaving.\nConfess Your Sins\nRoobarb\nSpace @ The Cross\nGoods Yard, off King's Way, King's Cross\n(opp. Bagley's Warehouse). Currently\nmonthly party on Fridays. 1 0 pm6 am, capacity - 360. Dress code to boldly go where no man has gone before.\nSpace is the unofficial member's party at\nthe Cross, but you can also wangle your\nway in if you are press (tee-he c!) and if\nyou arc a really keen punter. It's a coll ab oration between several nights -Enigma, Bambi & Bo, and Glitterati, the\nlast two of which have staged some of\nthe most legendary nights at Ihc Cross\n(and that really is saying something). Try\nto get to these when they run 'cos they\nare just so ooo funky, but also try to find\nyour way into Space, if you've got a bit\nof clubbing time spare.\nBut, as you might imagine with any\ntrip into Space, this requires lots of prep a ration. A \"space\" dress code really does mean you have to make the effort and get some futuristic togs and accessories.\nOtherwise you probably won't get in\nand if you do manage to somehow, then you really will feel out of place.\nThat's 'cos everyone else will definitely be\nlooking like Doctor Spock's family and their best mates the Jetsons. And as with\neverything in life (clich e alert) you will\nappreciate the effort put in once the\nparty starts.\nThe atmosphere inside is as friendly\nas you'll find and new friendships are\nforged merely on the basis of what silly\ntoys you've brought along with you. My talking C3P Open certainly came in useful although getting it to say \"Let the\nWook ie Win\" in time with the music was\na bit tricky!\nThe music is described by the DJs\nand promoters as \" Pumping Pneumatic\nParty\" tunes and that is exactly what you\nget, so I won't bother describing it any\nfurther. And as always The Cross itself\nwas great - still one of the most beautiful venues in the capital.\nAlthough Space has only run for two\nnights so far it is undoubtedly going to\nmake a very big impression on the Lond on club scene it's already been voted\n(on the internet) as The Cross' best party\n( good then or what?). It might easily\nbecome one of the nights to be at, just\nlike Serious@The Cross in 1998.\nThis night is just about as much fun\nas you can have clubbing. Try your hardest to get tickets - you'll love it. \"A good time you will have\" as good old Yoda\nwould say.\nMay the force be with you Roobarb\n\n"

    "content": "10 Feature 22 February 1999\nInternational Night Savoured\n-MM\nill: k*,;. From the Sublime to Sesame Street, International Night\nwas an offensive on the senses. Andrew Ofori sampled\nthe night's multi-cultural offerings. (Photos:Aliki & Jonas)\nSherfield's hallowed halls came alive\nwith colour and vi bran cc as the boh eml an melting pot that Is International Night made its annual appear ance, the OSC's flagship event, staged on Friday 12 February, provided those in\nattendance the opportunity to revel in\nthe College's wealth of cultural diversity.\n\" One of the important and unique characteristics of Imperial College is its\ninternational culture\", stated the absent\nRector as he conveyed his best wishes.\nA co-operation equal in standing to this\nvariety was the key to the event's success, with many of the college's overseas societies showcasing their talents.\nThe food fair, which opened the event, treated the much put upon student taste buds to a multitude of delicacies from across the globe. Limited\nto only two selections each an expectant\ncrowd milled around theM D FI in a quandary as the florid culinary delights\nbeckoned to them. The large quantity\nof food left as the fair closed suggested an increase in servings per ticket would lead to less waste and more waistline,\nalthough the rapturous glint in the eyes\nof the many servers suggested good homes would be found for the excess.\nMany of the societies opted for the traditional dishes which incorporated the major elements of the nation's diet. A case in point was the German Society,\noffering Wiener Schnitzel with sauer-kr aut: pungent pickled cabbage mer ci fully tamed by the breaded veal cutlets.\nThe aesthetic award for the evening surely went to the product of the japan ese Society who were serving beautifully\npresented sushi, the bold colouring belied the mild flavour. The Sri\nLankan's chicken dish was strictly\nfor the brave or accustomed, the spicy rice was complemented by t the particularly spicy chicken Appetites appeased, those in attendance were subjected to an inspiring\njourney through some of the rich tradition and culture the College had to offer. The jovial variety show was,\nto say the1 least esoteric\nin places, having ^^mm*\nopened with\nthe customary flag show, many of the societies presented intricate plots deeply rooted in their\ncountry's heritage. History was one of the major themes of the evening, with\nmany of the acts demonstrating enterprise and wit in tracing their society's development: none more comprehensively than the Japanese presentation\nwhich deemed it necessary to start with\nthe cavemen as they described their\ncountry's progression through religious\nharmon is ation and agricultural subsistence through to the current prosperous\nwestern industrialism. It was heartening\nto see the Koreans, whose act followed a similar format, take such a sanguine view of the Fast's current economic cri-sis.\nOn occasions the stage-play\napproached obscurity and the often excessive lighting effects did not help\nmatters. But the sheer enthusiasm of all\nthose involved was one of the show's major assets, gaining the audience's respect and appreciation. Traditional dances formed a major part of the evening's entertainment, with varying\nstandards of choreography.\nThe Malaysian Gad is Saravak' dance was one of the show's more sophist ica ted performances, the elegant movements intended to\nbe \"reflective of a joyous and happy\n.t mo sphere\". Much of the dancing was pero r med to mel-traditional\nmusic given amo dern appeal with a beat-laden tempo, an infectious combination which often\nhad the audience clapping along. There were various com peres for\nthe night, whose shameless space-filling\ngrew increasingly comical as the night\nwore on. Their plight was not helped when acts such as the grossly el on gated belly dance failed to engage the attentive crowd. Undoubted crowd favourite was 'Singapore Town', an act whose subdued beginnings ill-prepared the audience for the hilarious festival of fun that ensued. In what can only be described as a Sesame Strect-cum-Brady\nBunch drama tis ation, portraying the symbolism of their national flag, the Singapore Society had the audience in\nfits of laughter as they bounded about\nthe stage in oversized face masks. The\npseudo nursery rhyme accompaniment explained the flag's origins and went on to narrate a sketch of Singapore's mod ern-day life.\nThe euphoric conclusion to the show saw all those involved take the stage, many triumphantly brandishing flags. The scene epi tomis ed the OS C variety-in-harmony ethic.\nA fire alarm temporarily postponed the evening's proceedings but failed to\ndampen spirits at the after-show disco.\nThe night's eclectic appeal flowed on to\nthe dance floor as the JCR was filled with\na unique selection of R'n' B bhangra and even Greek dance music. The packed dancefloor were obviously came to party and did not appear to\nobject to the bizzar e irregularity of the transient music. One of the evening's highlights were the skilled Sikhs who took to the dance floor armed with their\ndrums and sounded out the beat to the\nmodern dance tracks - truly a sight to\nbehold. The SCR provided a feast of easy living from laid-back folk to the dulcet\ntones of jazz, the band provided a welcome reprieve from the heaving JCR\ndance floor.\nAlthough somewhat formulaic in\ntheir approach, employing the standard\nformat of previous years, the OS C pro-vi ded enough to keep the returning\naudience entertained and gave those\nvisiting their first International Night, a unique and memorable spectacle.\n\n"

Both candidates promised to fight to keep it open. Tim highlighted money, space and minibuses as the main issues affecting all\nclubs. Duncan agreed, but also added fair\ntreatment from the Union, referring to Artsoc's recent budget cuts.\nThe issue of minibuses was surprisingly painless, considering the discussion\nthat has been going on recently. Both Tim\nand Duncan( and later, the D P(F&S) can-di dates) thought the Union buses were in\na bad way, but promised to look into the\noptions available.\nThere seemed to be very little to separate the three candidates for the post of\nDP (F&S) other than dress sense. Whilst\nPaul Hickman avoided criticism, Bob Walker's dangling belt raised comment on all three nights, and Ian Clifford upheld half of his Slave Auction promise to attend\nthe South Ken Hustings in drag. Various\nmethods of increasing the Union's, and particularly clubs', budgets were suggested: sponsorship, greater efficiency\nand \"screwing College out of everything\nwe can get\" - Bob's phrase, but endorsed by Ian and Paul.\nAll candidates agreed that loss-mak-ing services should be sub sidi sed, as long as they were providing a genuine service\nto students - catering being a prime exam ple. They also re-iterated the regulations\nconcerning additional income generated\nby clubs: that ICU technically couldn't touch it, and it should not be com pen sated for by a reduced budget.\nFinally, the candidates for President\ntook to the stage. All except Stuart Cook,\nthat is, who has taken no part in the elections so far. This left Shan Katuwawala,\nTasha Newton, Dennis Patrickson, Robin\nPitt, Ben Polounovsky and Andy Swift.\nQuestions on a broad range of topics were asked. A common theme was\nthe elections themselves, with issues such\nas South Ken apathy, the Medics' alleged\nblock voting, and publicity recurring at\ndifferent Hustings.\nOn topics such as fees, politics, and the NUS, Robin was the only overly political candidate; he was also the only one to favour greater integration with the\nNUS, although he would put this to a ref-er end um. Everyone else distanced them selves from party politics. Andy and Shan\nagreed that the NUS was a nice idea, but\nineffective in practice. Tasha considered\nit too political, and Ben and Dennis favoured other options.\nAll the candidates seem to be in\nfavour of increased C CU activity and identity. In fact, when asked what they\nthought was Dave Hellard's biggest error,\nTasha, Shan and Dennis said that it was\nthe increasing divide between ICU and the CCUs. Robin said that it was failing to\npublicise the fight against fees; Andy criticised his handling of club funding; Ben\ndecided that the 'Presidential Talkback'\nphoto was the absolute low point.\nOne area where all the candidates\nwant to bring about changes is communications throughout the College. Shan\nwanted to use the CCUs, clubs and societies more effectively. Tasha, Ben and\nDennis favoured more reports in Felix, as\nwell as email and phones. Dennis also\nadvocated a Union newsletter, and better\nCouncil publicity. Andy wanted much greater use of email, while Robin preferred the direct approach of talking to\npeople.\nNoone candidate seemed to gain\nconsistently more approval than the o th ers, especially at South Ken. At Mary's, Tasha fared well, although Shan helped his cause by criticising Dave Hellard, and telling Chris Ince to \"shut the fuck up.\"\nDennis and Andy came out well; Robin's enthusiasm for politics won over several\npeople; and Ben's offbeat approach distinguished him from the others.\nOne good thing about Hustings Is\nwatching the candidates do silly things in\nan attempt to win favour. So at South Ken\nwe had Dave Hellard kissing Bob Walker;\nIan Clifford in a short skirt; the Presidential candidates downing a truly unpleasant-looking pint of Carlsberg, Bailey's and Coke,- and a brief Riverdance. Medics take\ntheir drinking seriously - each candidate\nat St. Mary's was required to down a pint\nof lager before they answered their ques-tion s.On a similar line, there were several questions that were somewhat irreverent: candidates' favourite jokes and\nmasturbation habits came up.\nThe cheap beer encouraged the\noccasional unwise comment. The Felix\nreporter's lasting memory of the South\nKen Hustings will be a certain prominent\nUnion official declaring that he wanted another well known personality \"up my\narse\". A truly lovely image.\nInterviews with the candidates are\non Pages 12 to 16.\n2 2\nLdi \u2022 ion Assistani . . .

    "content": "20\nReviews\nFilm 22 February 1999\nPatch Adams * * *\nStarring : Robin Williams, Daniel London, Monica Potter, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bob Gunton\nDirector: Tom Shadyac\nIt has long been known that Robin\nWilliams films divide neatly up into\ntwo camps worthy and beard y( Good Will Hunting, Dead Poets Society\nThe Fisher King), and showboating( Aladdin, Good Morning Vietnam,\nHook, Mrs Doubtfire) - and never the twain shall meet. Right? Not necessarily,\nbecause Patch Adams attempts to combine every known Williams element under the sun. Thus, he' s grandstanding one minute and dewy eyed the next\n- plus he quotes poetry, wears silly cos-tum es, overacts (hideously, but hilari-ou sly), and tries to change the world. Oh, and he' s got a beard. Some of the time.\nThe other key factor to his career is\nthe amazing way in which he flies from critical acclaim to utter disaster - for exam ple, his brilliant performance in Good\nWill Hunting came on the back of painful-to-watch roles in both Flubber and Jack.\nConsequently it should come as no surprise that, having suffered the ignominy that was What Dreams May Come just a couple of months ago, he's back on top form. Indeed, the role is so Robin Williams that It's barely possible to Beard - worthy; No beard - funny. Simple, huh?\nbelieve that it's really a true story...\n...Which leads us nicely to the plot,\nwhere in Williams plays the role of the\neponymous Patch Adams, who, having\nleft his self-imposed spell in a psychiatric hospital, decides to enter Med School. But (surprise surprise), he's not\nat all happy with the system, and he rebels against the style of doctor-patient\nrelationship taught by Gun ton. He prefers a more emotional attachment,\nand the opportunity to make the patients\nfeel better, through an amazing line in\nslapstick and general Robin Williams style\nbuffoonery. As I said before, it's a role so\nperfect for him that it's hard to believe\nit's true.\nOK, so occasionally It's fairly obvious\nthat Williams has slipped free and is\nimprovising at will, but so what - he is,\nafter all, one of the most gifted comics\nof his generation. No, the bigger issue is\nthe grating sentimentality which is\ndragged out of every possible scene,\nand the massive suspension of disbelief\nrequired to accept that Monica Potter\n(Martha meet Frank, Daniel and Laurence) could possibly end up falling for\na deranged oldman like Williams.\nIn the end, however, these problems pale into insignificance - the standard downside of any Robin Williams\nfeature. Consequently, what' s left is\nsomething which, whilst far from brilliant ( and, indeed, far from Williams'\nbest) is nonetheless an engaging, heart-warming story - made all the more special thanks to its real-life basis. Patch\nAdams himself is the real star - and you're\nleft in wonder that it's taken thirty years\nfor the story of such an amazing man to\ncome to light. Q Dave\nAffliction \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nStarring : Nick Nolte, James Coburn, Sissy Spacek, Willem Dafoe\nDirector: Paul Schrader\nA small town where nothings big seems to happen sets the scene for Affliction. Wade Whitehouse, Nick Nolte, is the sole police officer in\nthis town, a mere figure head in a village that has little crime. His life is littered with tragedy a broken marriage,\nmemories of an abusive childhood and a nagging toothache. Nothing seems to be going his way until he sees a chance for redemption and rec ogni tion. When a weekend hunter dies\nunder mysterious circumstances Wade sees a conspiracy and a cover-up.\nBelieving that once he uncovers all the sordid details his life will take a turn for\nthe better, he in fact starts to alienate\nhimself through his wild accusations.\nHowever without solving the little nagging things in his life an alter ego starts\nto take form which ultimately leads\nhim to paranoia.\nAffliction is a clever film, pulling on every viewer's curiosity and desire for a conspiracy from this possible murder. I'm no expert, but I don't think he's at all well.\nThis over-active imagination is the catalyst for Wade's slow and painful fall into\nhis father's footsteps: a father's alcoholism and violence which is ultimately\npassed to his son. The film is not violent\nbut the apparent mental discomfort arising from the acting is extremely vivid.\nWade's father played by James Coburn portrays a convincing senile alcoholic,\nwho still abuses his son mentally despite\nhis old age. Nolte's,on the other hand, shows that he is definitely an under a ted actor: as his character drifts into alcoholism and violence Nolte starts to\nmimic his father's traits, and this is when you start to realise the path the film is\ntaking.\nThis film won't appeal to everyone:\nits bleak outlook on one man's life and the inevitable 'like father, like son' story\nleaves you uneasy, however this film is\ncentred on the characters' affliction\nrather than the solution. The sparse narration by Willem Dafoe is a welcome relief as he essentially explains to the audience what has happened and what\ndoes happen to our unfortunate char-act er. What makes Affliction memorable is the way the story weaves through this tale, while subtly hiding the real\nplot, letting it slowly come to the surface\ntowards the finale. Q Magpie\n\n"

    "content": "22 February 1999 Elections 99/00 - Interviews 15\nDP (Clubs & Societies)\nTim Trailor\nWhat are your views on the current\nme dlc/ non-me dlc club hybrid split?\nHybrid's probably the best system\nwe've got at the moment, an dI'd like to\nsee that going for at least the next two and\na half years, which is the agreed period,\nand I'd like to look at possibly extending\nthat, especially for the big clubs and societies who have fulfil ed their full quota of\nBUSA teams, for possibly a couple of years\nafter that. But once we've had the full\nquota of medics through the South Kensington campus, I think we'd then need to\nlook at reviewing the situation. But keep\nit until we've had the full quota of students\nthrough the South Kensington campus.\nI understand you've had quite a lot of experience In the sporting side of things,\nbut what about when It comes to overseeing societies - what experience do you\nhave for this?\nOverseas societies. I haven't actually\nhad much contact with the overseas societies at Imperial, but I think that it's important to fund every club and society, and\nI 've got quite a good background, in that\nI kno vva bou l muli k nili nal i.u. and religious issues, i wi lu ld like lo apply that general background to the dubs and societies\nhere at IC.\nWould you change the current procedure\nfor setting up a new club and help give\nmote support to new clubs?\nI here is currently quite a good pro ced urc for setting up new clubs and societies - there is a handbook out which tells\nyou in quite a lot of detail what you need\nto do to set up a club. Anyone who comes\ninto the resource centre on the first floor\nof the Union building will find out from\neither Neil O 'Shaughnessy, whose the\nadministrator there, or from the DP (C&S), exactly what needs to be done. It's a fairly\npain free process.\nWhat is your opinion of ULU and the current stance of Imperial within that Union?\nULU pretty much mirrors the; BUSA situation in terms of leagues and things like\nthat, and especially Ihe entry require-ment s, although it didn't for part of last\nyear. It's the hybrid entry system - the\nsame teams can enter in both competitions. In your hustings speech you were talking\nabout a sports ground in Ealing that Imperial was thinking about selling off. Why do you think that'd be good?\nIt's a sport ground that's currently\nbeing rented out for agricultural use, or it\nwas once a sports ground apparently. It\nwas mentioned in a comprehensive review that t rank Murray did last month\nin which they're looking at rational ising Imperial College sports grounds. As it's a ground that's not actually used by anybody\nat the moment it would be quite a good candidate for selling off without causing\nanybody any problems.\nDuncan Field\nCould you expand on your ideas on how you expect clubs to make Income over\nthe year?\nI think there are one or two societies\nthat are already pretty adept at bringing\ntheir own money into the Union. DramSoc, which I have personal experience of,\nis one of those, and clubs like the Pimllco\nsociety, who are sponsored externally, I believe. I think we need to investigate the\npossibility of whether external sponsorship can provide extra money, as in the\ncurrent economic climate everbody's having to tighten their belts.\nAnd how would you propose to help\nthese clubs get sponsorship?\nI would be looking at communicating with companies in the London financial markets, companies that we traditionally have a goo d relationship with, like\nAndersen Consulting, that kind of thing.\nWe would be saying 'look, you're coming\nand head-hunting at Imperial every year,\nyou can have a lot of good publicity and\npress from helping our sports and soci-e ties.' I would then be operating as a mediator between the companies and\nthe clubs - trying to put people together,\narrange meetings, that kind of thing.\nWhat is your stance on the medic/non-medic sporting situation, and how would you make hybrid entry easier?\nThere's quite a few problems with\nthe: hybrid system at the moment, mainly\nadministrative;. It is doing its job - it is providing the medics the opportunity to play\nfor either ICSM or ICU. But there arc:\nproblems with trying to work out whose playing lor which team and stopping\nthem playing for more than one team in\na season, and also problems administratively with BUSA and the UL U leagues\nsending information to us when it should\nbe going to St. Mary's. We need proactive\neffective communication lo overcome\nPthis problem, making sure that BUSA\nknows what's going on. What made you want to do this job, and what clubs and societies have you been involved with?\nI 've been a member of DramSoc for\nfour years, director of acting for one year;\nI set up and am chairman this year of the\nEnvironmental Society, I 've been involved\nwith Pimlico society for a term as a tutor,\nand I 've been a member of various other\nsocieties including ArtSoc and St John's Ambulance Links. The reason I wanted to\ndo this was essentially because I found it\nvery difficult over the last couple of years\nto be as involved with the Union as I would like, primarily because of financial\nconstraints and because I find the degree\nat Imperial very demanding who does-n't? DP (C&S) will give me the opportunity\nto really get stuck in and do what I 've\nbeen wanting to do for the last four\nyears.\nStanding For All Posts\nNew Election,\n\n"

So, following on from the success of hits such\nas 'The Freaks Come Out', Fisher has\nbrought out a mix album. It features thirteen racks of deep underground house music including Studio 54's 'Freak It',\nHouse of 909's 'Beautiful Day' and Cevin\nFisher's 'The Freaks Come Out'. Superbly\nmixed, each track follows the previous\none really well instead of them being just\nchucked together in any old order. Cevin\nFisher has obviously taken his time over\nthis album, selecting only the best music\nand making sure it all fits together. He'll\nbe one to watch out for this year, and the\nalbum (out soon) will also be one to\nwatch out for. An absolute must.\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022*\nSound of the Nu Skool - Vol. I( Fresh Records)\nThis is a compilation album featuring\nthe best of the label's past and future Nu Skool sounds. Tracks include The\nFreestylers 'B Boy Stance', The Sol Brothers' cheeky 'That Elvis Track', Lovestation's alternative deep funky mix of 'Sensuality' and Electrotheque's 'Every-one's a Winner'. They are all mixed to per-fec tion, and if you like the big beat,\nfunky sounds that Fatboy Slim has made so popular, you'll love this.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nRoy Davis JR DJ Mix Album( Llvewire Records)\nA true Chicago house legend, DJ\nand producer, Roy Davis Jr commands the kind of respect usually reserved for\nroyalty. One listen to this classy album will send you to house heaven, showing you just why he is one of the biggest\nnames on the house scene. This mix\nalbum is a collection of underground, deep house grooves, including the\nanthem 'Gabriel'. The kind of music you would find in a pre-club bar or in the chill\nout room of a club, this album is a journey through the history of house music.\nIf you like the jazzy, funky house vibe,\nbuy this. Fabulous.\nOut In March. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nMiss Money penny' s Music presents Norm an Jay\nThere are so many compilation albums being released by clubs these\ndays, that many people don't give a toss\nanymore. If you want to do well in this\nmarket then you have to release some thing a bit different. So is this album, released by the glam super club Miss Money penny' s, that little bit different?\nWell, No. Alright, it's mixed by Norman Jay, but there is nothing on this album which makes it stand out The tracks are\njust the bog standard stuff Money penny' s play. It comes in two CDs - CD\n1 features house and garage music (cur-rent as well as past tunes) with CD2 feat u ring the \" Good Grooves Mix\" a collection of sounds from all over the\nmusic world. Out of the two, the second\nCD is a little better, but as an overall pack-age it's nothing to shout about.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSingle of the Week Jimi Tenor\n'Year of the Apocalypse'\nA couple of weeks ago we reviewed\nJimi Tenor's rather superb album Organ ism'. In March, he releases the breathtaking 'Year of the Apocalypse', a very\nuplifting and melodic track. This is a track\nwhich sounds like a bit of a garage tune,\nbut at the same time has chilled, melodic\nsounds. The beat is simple and the tune\nis catchy and the singer must be praised\nfor managing to sing 'Year of the Apocalypse' in the chorus. The 12\" comes with a couple of mixes, each different to\nthe other (one being a bit more vocal),\nand a second, separate track. Doing well in the Coolcuts Chart, this makes great listening.\nOut March \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe Four Usual Suspects\n'1999'\nIn a word, this single is bollocks.\nSurely there is a regulatory body to stop\ncrap like this being produced. The four\nUsual Suspects, including Roger Sanchez\nand Angie Johnson, have reproduced1999 as a dance version of Prince's classic tune, and completely murdered it.\nAngie Johnson excels in singing completely out of sync with the tune, whilst\nthe rest of the four give the single \"a new house vibe\". What the hell is going on here? It's not meant to be a f\"***g dance tune. Comes with loads of remixes, each as bad as the others and completely indistinguishable. This is a superb example of someone taking a great classic, and turning it into a feeble\ndance track for commercial gain. Avoid.\nSundance\nThe Living Dream'\nThis is the kind at unc you'll either\nreally love or really hate. Following on from their national chart success with\n'Sundance' (the eponymous ly titled sin-g le), Sundance have released their new single 'The Living Dream'. Full of cheesy\nbeats, vocals, pianos and breakdowns,\nthis is typical Euro house music, but it's so bloody catchy you can't help humming along. It comes with half a dozen mixes over a couple of CD's. Some of\nthe mixes sound the same( odd that!)\nwhilst the Transa remix is a completely\ndifferent tune in itself.\nOut now\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nGur m Donna Dee' Hooked'( Mecca Recordings)\nThis is a strange record. The A sides\nare good funky garage with plenty of\nchunky beats. Not too memorable really,\nbut still worth a listen if you are a garage\nfiend. However, it's the B side remix of\n\" Hooked\" which really does it for me. It's up-beat house, and wouldn't be out of\nplace in one of Judge Jules' sets. Nice\nbreak-downs and build-ups added to an\ninfective tune make this one to look out\nfor.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 . . \u2022 . . . . . . .\n\u2022 \u2022 . . \u2022 ::\u2022\n: it ; i \u2022\n\n"

Malaysian Focus\nPM's Dialogue with Students in London as Conspiracy Theory Ruled Irrelevant On Saturday, February the6 th, the Malaysian community in London was in for a rare treat when Its premier. Dr.\nMahathir held a dialogue session at the\nMalaysia Hall in Marble Arch. The PM was on his way to the Group of15 Third\nWorld Countries summit in Jamaica and decided to take this opportunity to meet Malaysians here. Hundreds of students and expatriates working here filled the\ntwo halls allocated to listen to the PM's speech concerning the latest political\nand economic development back home. In his address, the PM touched on a number of matters. Clearly in campaigning mode. As the general elect ion is due early next year, he summarised some of many achievements that the present ruling coalition\nparty had accomplished in the 42 years\nit had been in power. He mentioned the\nsuccessful rebound made after the recession in the early 1980s resulting in\nremarkable economic growth at the dizzy heights of8% for 10 consecutive years. However, we were brought down to earth again with the outbreak of the\nAsian economic crisis in 1997. He also\nemphasised the country' s push towards becoming a more techno log ical-based country with the construe-lion ol i he,\". iv\nimpressive Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), the\nMultimedia Super Corridor (MSC) and Washington like administrative city,\nPutrajaya.\nNevertheless, ask any of the audience members what they remember most about that day and a majority will\ndefinitely recall the brave, young graduate who defiantly stood in front of the\nmost powerful person in Malaysia and asked him to resign over the events\nrevolving around the Anwar Ibrahim's black eye episode. The statement by\nthat student drew large applause from\nthe audience which prompted Dr.\nMaha thir to goon the offensive and defended his actions. In reply he made Nik B Haflz\nthe all-important\nannouncement that he will not\nresign as long as he\nhas influence on the choice of the\nlle ei ii I:| ill\nill ll lL ii^111111,111; country. Gasps when he then told\nthe same student that he had opened himself to a defamation suit as the PM denied ever stating that Anwar Ibrahim\nhad self-inflicted the injuries to garner\nsympathy, as was accused by the questioner. At the end of the day, not many opinions, be it pro, against or neutral\nover occurrences in Malaysia, were converted after the session with the\nPM. 'Not Relevant' seemed to be the\norder of the day in Kuala Lumpur High Court as Anwar Ibrahim started his\ndefence, testifying from the witness box. Judge Augustine Paul had ruled\nthat any mention or implying the exist en ce of a political conspiracy to bring\ndown Anwar was disallowed, stating\nthat it was irrelevant to the power corr up tion charges. This did not deter Anwar from telling the court that he\nhad made many enemies whilst in gove rn ment and many times implicated Dr.\nMaha thir, claiming that the PM wanted to 'finish him off. Anwar, confident and\ncheerful as always, even managed to\nlighten the serious mood of the proc ee dings by making humorous, sarcastic remarks against the PM, the police\nand some other individuals whom he\nmaintained had plotted to ruin him polit-ic ally. The former DPM demonstrated that he was no ordinary witness and constantly engaged in heated exchanges with the public prosecutors\nwhen he was prevented from explaining\nhis answers. At one time he was even accused of being evasive. Even though it is still early days, it is clear that Anwar and his lawyers will find it increasingly\ndifficult to prove his assertion of the exist en ce of a 'political conspiracy' when the mere mention of the phrase is not\neven permitted by the judge.

Letters & Small Ads 2 2 Feb rua rv1999 Keep It Down!\nDear Felix\nThe local police have recently passed\nonto the Union a number of concerns from local residents about the level of noise on Prince Consort Road after the\nbars close and Union events finish.\nThe Union worked extremely hard to\nobtain its licence, involving a lot of negotiation with our neighbours, and the local\npolice. If we are to keep the licence (and\nso our late night events), it is up to the\npeople leaving our events to have some respect for the local residents and keep\nnoise levels down in residential areas -which includes the Quad, and on the street outside Beit Hall.\nDon't be one of the handful that\ncould spoil it for everyone, please keep the noise down when leaving the Union remember we are only a small part of the local community. Thanks\nMark Home Events & Marketing Manager How to Stop Bike Theft?\nDear Felix\nLast Friday evening I decided, quite out\nof the blue, to sink a few jars in Southside after work. A couple was stretched\ninto a few, as they do, and I ended up doing the sensible thing and walking home. On Monday I came to collect my\nbike from the racks to the side of the bar,\nonly to find almost 100 pounds worth of\nparts missing from the frame. None were quick release, so some little shit had been there removing them with tools.\nThe main frame of the bike was secured\nwith a good quality D lock.\nI went straight to security to make a report and was told this sort of theft happened at least once a week, often more,\nfrom those racks alone! I then asked if we could vie w the film from the security\ncamera, only to be told there was no camera erected there. No chance of catching anyone for this one then. I inquired further and discovered that there is only one camera on the whole of the campus, which covers the\nbike racks outside RSM. ( Incidentally, I have a friend whose bike was stolen\nfrom there not so long ago and he was\ngutted to find out that security had not\neven turned the camera on!) This\nseemed a little bit silly, considering all the\nbikes that come in and out of the College\ndaily. Maybe the police will be able to help I thought.\nSo there I found myself actually listening properly and taking heed of the\nwords from one of our boys in blue.\nHe suggested I write a letter to those\nin authority to try and get things moving on this front. He told me that Bclgravia\npolice station are getting tired of the time wasted in filling out theft reports\nfrom our campus and have got nowhere with their requests for full electronic sur-veil lance. I told him that even our security had noticed this cunning pattern of theft, but nothing had been done to stop it. So why then, have our people ignored these requests from the local\npolice who are supposed to be fully\ncooperating with our security measures?\nMaybe, after finally managing to stop\nthe weekly computer chip thefts from the\nlast few years, we may be able lo concentrate on preserving the properly of the students, not just that of the College\nentity itself.\nMaybe some of the money used to purchase such things as the dead trees\nthat are so delicately planted outside the\nBMS building or the intricately woven patterns of cheap bushes outside the library, in future could be spent on syst ems to protect the students' scanty pos-sessions.\nIdo not know why things have not\ngot moving on this front, even with\npolice persuasion. Maybe our old friend\nCaldwell is responsible, which would explain everything. Answers please.\nNeil Forsyth PG2\nWell, Nell, we took your letter to Mr Ken\nWeir, Chief Security Officer. What follows Is a summary of his reply. If you feel\nthis doesn't answer all your points, please\nget back to us - after all, bike theft Is an Important Issue for many IC students.\nEd\nThere are actually two security cameras\non Watts Way one just outside the Health Centre and the other at the other\nend; it is actually impossible to place a camera overlooking the bike racks in\nsuch a way that it does not infringe the\nprivacy of other local residents, the num ber of bike thefts outside Southside is\nabout the same as the number outside\nthe Shcrfield Building -18 for the whole of 1998. I here are three cameras covering bike racks directly, not counting the\nSouthside ones. I'm not saying that the\nsystem is perfect - there arc too many bike parks and resources are limited. We do work closely with the local police in\nthis regard - last year, seven separate\nplain-clothes operations were mounted where they made use of college facilities\nto identify and apprehend bike thieves,\nwhile security staff made eight bike-theft\nrelated arrests. Bike thefts are prevalent\nin colleges particularly urban ones where a lot of students and members of\nstaff use Ihem, and a lot of the bike\nthievery that takes place here is organised in nature, not opportunistic.\nKen Weir (CSO)\nFocus Group on Apathy?\nDear Felix,\nIam writing about my concerns regarding the IC apathy that we know so well.\nOver the past few weeks, the Union has\ndevised a way for all IC students to play\na part in the everyday running of the\nUnion services. I was very disappointed to find that, after special days were arranged for students to turn up to the\nso-called FOCUS GROUPS, that only a handful of people turned up. Over the\nfour years I have been at IC, I have been heavily involved with the Union, and know that it tries its very hardest to provide the services that the students so badly need. After over 400 direct e mails\nto students, two weeks of advertising in\nFelix and numerous posters around the\ncollege, I find it very surprising that IC students don't really care about how their\nUnion is run for them. Over the years, the\nUnion has received numerous com plaints and criticisms about the various\nservices that it runs, and now, after they\nhave had the chance to change and modify these services to suit their needs,\nthe IC apathy strikes again. I now ask\nmyself that do IC students really care\nabout their Union?\nA very concerned and disappointed K Mahmood( Aero 3)\nCynical Conscience\nDear felix,\nI was intrigued by last week's comment entitled \"The Audible Conscience\". Although the article was devastating ly pessimistic and about as subtle as a GCSE\nEnglish essay, it was still good to see some criticism of our modern, urban\nlifestyle.\nBesides damning nearly everything\ncaused by mass urbanisation, the article\nfocussed on very important issues such\nas poverty, homelessness, pollution and traffic. This is all summed up with a com plaint about how apathetic everybody is\nand how things can not change as a result.\nWhat I find particularly frustrating\nabout this article and other similar articles\nis that they do not mention any positive\nmeans of action. Once the reader's conscience is satisfactorily shaken, they\nshould then be presented with ways that\nthey can do something about these issues. The article should continue so it\ncan mention steps we can take to oppose our \"meaningless existence\". This\ncould be done simply by mentioning relevant action groups, outlining steps that\ncan betaken as well as giving MPs addresses such that we can voice our\nconcerns.\nHopefully, a more balanced approach to this type of article will\nencourage people to be more perceptive\nand less apathetic.\nDavid Hawkins (ERE I) OK, I get the message. Space Is short,\nso... Our MP is the Rt Hon Peter Brooke\n(Conservative). Address letters to the House of Commons, Palace of Westminster - but you might as well try per-sua ding an Oxford blue barge pole.

Another good pro-democracy group LsCharter88;\nwww.charter88. org.uk. - Ed\nBigThankyou for Phone\nDear Felix,\nI would like to say thanks to whoever it\nwas that handed my phone in to the\nunion bar staff on Monday night after the\nhustings. I lost it because i had had a bit\ntoo much vodka and had thought it\nunlikely that I would get it back, so Iam v. grateful to you for handing it in.\nthanks.\nKaren Yates (Physics, PG I) The Time-Travelling Saint?\nDear Felix,\nJust a quick note in response to lain\nMcNaught' s very interesting article about\nValentine's Day: The first St Valentine\nmust have been bloody clever to be a Christian priest in 270BC Ta,\nD Clarke\nDear Mr Clarke,\nJust goes to show what bollocks they\npublish on the internet.\nYours au los um mari singly, lain McNaught Deadline for letters is\n12noon Wednesday.\nLetters may be edited for length, but\nwill not be altered in any other way.\nLetters need not be signed, but a swipe card must be shown when submitting anonymous letters.\n\n"

IT AWT ALL BAD!!\nIt's a hard knock life at this place and after a nice rest from the rig ours of this column th a bomb has returned to provide the missing flav a, and we got loads for ya. First up there' s the return of the beautiful trio\nTLC, with their third album Fanmail, which is reviewed by Clubs c en ce's Gur m. Then comes the Tommy Boy\nGreatest Beats album, which is a look back at some hiphop classics of our time, as well as that I got the phat Whitney single. At last the Whitney Houston tune is getting a release , it's not right it\nhad to be so long but its OK. The massive club hit\nIts Not Right But Its OK is taken from her wicked album My Love Is Your Love. It gets a two CD release,\nthe first disc has three mixes on it, the stomping original and then two very shitty house& garage mixes that just fuck it up for me, but then I hate house. The second disc has the same Club69 mix and then two old Whitney tunes, the Annie Lennox penned Step By Step and the excellent\nI'm Every Woman. Why on earth did they put the Club69 mix and not the original mix on the second CD, the second disc is better with the two old tunes, but the Club69 mix is shit and so you have to buy the first disc instead. It's all\nabout the money. Th a Bomb's gonna be big in the weeks upcoming, with special features com in' right at ya!I' month a case with big interviews from my soul s is ta Beverley Knight and my current favourite crew Desert Eagle Discs. It's gonna be massive. Love U All.\nMilen\nVARIOUS ARTISTS A double album of classic hiphop tunes.\nTommy Boy have some of the greatest hiphop artists of all time signed to them and after\na few years of re-releasing some of the deleted classics they have come out with a compilation album of their greatest beats! The first disc opens up with Afrika\nBambaataa's Planet Rock from way back in the day,\nwith a funk driven bass line and the classic call &\nresponse style rap, the album opens upon a high. The album moves along smoothly with\nEverything's Gonna Be\nAlright by Naughty By\nNature on to Doowutyalike from Digitial Underground, before stalling on De La\nSoul's ridiculously long Buddy (remix). Then the killer tune pulls up and hits ya Can't You See.\nThis R&B anthem was the first thing we heard from the bad girls, Total and it\nsimply blew me away then, and still does to this\nday. To keep the groove going the original ladies\nsong Ladies First is dropped in next, Queen Latifah\nrocks the mic over a styled out saxophone riff, before Mon ie Love ( remember her) kicks out a few rhymes.\nThen comes the massive crossover hit from House of Pain, you know what it is, right?...Yeah...that's right\nJump Around. From that House of pain party tune we move across to the laid back sounds of De La Soul\nwith Plug Tunln'and the jazzy Afrika Bamba at a a tune\nJazzy Sensation before hitting the funky hump y Eiumpty Dance from Digitial Underground. And to\nclose out the first disc they bring back those massive\nTommY\nGREATEST\nBEATS\nparty tunes with the classic O.P.P. and Apaches Gangsta Bitch.\nSwitching over the second disc I was hit with the\nall time great De La Soul tune Me, Myself and I, all those\nold skool memories come flooding back, but they disappear just as quickly with the next tune the awful\nHouse Of Pain track Shamrocks And Shenanigans. Why is this shit track next to De La Soul? A serious disappointment after such a good start. But they\nredeem themselves with\nCoolio' sg funk driven\nFantastic Voyage, the only\ndrawback is the Timber\nRemix when the original\nmix is so much better.\nPairs' Grip of Shame is\nincluded here, but why?\nThere are superior Paris\ntunes to pick so why this\none? Next up is Queen Latifahs chilled out Latifahs Had it Up There, a prime example of the girls skills before moving on to a couple of massive chart hits. Naughty By Natures Hip Hop\nHooray and the spot hitter Come Baby Come from K7. The final run down consists of as cries of old skool classics, the standout of the\nbunch being De La Souls wicked Ring, Ring, Ring,\nbefore the finishing track, Coolio's Dangerous Minds single Gangsta's Paradise.\nThe whole package is wonderful value for money, but I would have preferred just one disc full of the absolute classics, without the fillers.\nDisc 1 - 8 / 1 0 Disc 2 = 7/10\nMilen\nTLC\nThough a certain press officer from a major UK label will disagree, TLCs one and only hit in\nthe UK was Waterfalls-as wing in' ballad many years ago. Now, the trio are back with a complete revamp, not only of their musical talents but of their\nattitudes too. Simply put, TLC arc good; no, actually\nthey are brilliant - a fact reflected in their comeback album Eanmail. Fanmail has taken TLC into a new dimension as they include production work from Jam\nand Lewis (Janet Jackson), Jermaine Dupri (Mariah\nCarey) and new boy Shekspere. The album features\n17 tracks and covers the full spectrum of great R&B flav as. There arc tunes with hard bass lines and husky\nvocals such as Fanmail and Silly Ho, the emotive ballads such as No Scrubs, a slow and groovy track.

    "content": "12 Elections 99/00 - Interviews 22 February 1999\nICU President\n9 Dennis Patrickson\nWhat Is your opinion on medic and Imperial sports'teams?\nI think the point of this question is how they\nare going to survive in light of the BUSA sit-u ation. I think hybrid entry has been\nexplained fully already. One of the key issues\nI feel I need to raise is what happens when\nit does actually fully merge. Under BUSA this\nhas already been ruled, so there will be single entry. One of the problems I see is with\nthe medics' rugby team - they are better than\nthe South Kensington campus. I want to see\ntheir first team entering in the first division.\nIf they turn into the IC first team they'll be\nentering in the second division. I think Dave\nHellard's maybe making some headway\nthere but it would be stupid if ICs first team.\nwhich would be mostly medics, was entering in the second division. I think that's a key\npoint that needs to be dealt with.\nWhat Issues need to be resolved with respect\nto the merger with Wye College?\nAccommodation for a start. I don't know if\nthe first year undergraduates will be coming\nhere? or not. I guess with the postgraduates\nit will end up in a Silwood Park type of situ-ation. If the first year undergraduates are\ncoming here, there isn't enough accommodation as it Is, so that will be something\nthat'll need to be sorted, that would be the\nmost urgent thing on the Wye College\nmerger. I really want to ensure that first years\nget accommodation, because it'll frighten\npeople off when they're applying il th cyr e not certain of accommodation.\nAre you proposing to do anything that will\ndramatically change IC student life?\nI want to try and inform people, so they'll\nknow what's going on. Ihere isn't enough\nof aci rde of communication going on within\nIC, within ICU, within departments, within\nCCUs. It all boils down to us communicating\nmore with each other and getting feedback I 'll be asking for feedback as well.\nWhat Mark Home's doing with these focus\ngroups, that's exactly the way I want to go.\nIt'll Increase involvement and it will help\novercome this feeling of Isolation and exclusion that some people in the IC community\nare feeling at the moment How do you Intend to merge the medics\nand non-medics, and bring the college\ntogether?\nThe question is how do you do that over the\nnext two years, because after that there'll be\nthree years who have all applied to Imperial\nCollege, rather than applying to a Med School, and then it'll be integrated by itself.\nThe difficult thing is the next two years - trying to get people to get rid of this secular\nidea. The only way we can do that is informing people what you do and what they do.\nIt shouldn't be us versus them - it should be\ncommunicating in a circle.\nNatasha Newton\nCould you explain how you are going to handle the merger of the various sports teams\nwhen you so adam ent ly fought against\nthem?\nIt would be jumping the gun to say how Council is going to view BUSA entry and ULU\nentry. It's the President's role to guide and help\nphrase emotions, but it's not really personally\nmy decision. Ifw e were to merge the clubs,\nif that's what Council went for, then I would\nuse the Boat dub as my model because that\nBoat dub has worked with medics and IC,\nrowing alongside each other for ten years.\nWhen you Ve got such a fine model of how it can work and how student resources can\ngo in an excellent direction, that's where\nyou Ve got to start.\nHow do you Justify to the smaller dubs the\ndisproportionately' huge amount of funds that\nare allocated to the boat dub?\nIt's very difficult to justify just the money\nOne of the problems is that the equipment\nfor rowing Is just so expensive. All that's happened with the allocation of finance is that\npeople get what they need, as much as is\npossible. Unfortunately we can't do anything\nabout the fact that the top eight cost so\nmuch, and when we have such talent in the\nclub, would it be right to say 'sorry, guys, you\nhaven't got the money.' Ihe system outwardly is not very fair - but if you want to play\nyour sport well, we'll back you up one hundred percent. Ihat doesn't mean that just\nbecause you aren't going to be a rower\nyou're not going to get your money it means\nif you can show us you're really keen, we'll\ngiven you a trial run. and if you do it from\nthere, we're behind you all the way\nWhat Isyour opinion on Imperial'slack of a ff lli at Jon to the NUS and wo ufc l you change that?\nI don't think that we should be affiliated to the\nNUS. I do think it's a very good idea but if we\nwant to join the NUS we have to have a referendum of college because it's a vital issue,\nand it should be something that every student\nhas a chance to answer Personally I think\nwhat we're doing as ICU and in combination\nwith ULU, making 100,000 students compared to our 10,000 - we are fighting for London Underground to change I ares I air for all.\nWe are getting discounts, and that can go\ntowards next year, Ila ving been at UCL last\nyear for my BSc, I was really quite strongly\nattacked by an NUS representative, I know it's only one person, but he was really full-on and\npolitical. I would be concerned that that\nwould happen to us at IC.\nYour manifesto seems to be fairly generic,\npromising things that seem to be promised\nevery year and are sram ewha tun quan tlf lar^ What exact policies do you w f ch to Implement\nIn your possible tenure?\nI think it is generic, it is, \"students, students,\nstudents...\" But that is answering what I perceive to be as one of the biggest problems\n- ICU becomes its own club for politics, and\nthat's all. Specificallythe communication side\nthat's practical, things like the e mail system\nin halls.\n9 Robin Pitt\nWhat Is your opinion on the current lack of\naffiliation of imperial College to the NUS?\nQuite frankly, I feel that it isolates students\nof this college from campaigns that take\nplace in other colleges in the UK. I think we lose out in hearing about what they are up\nto, how they are fighting back against the\nattacks on them; for example, fees. The\nfight against fees in this college has been led\nby SWSS, whereas in NUS colleges demos\nhave been advertised quite widely.\nHow would you better our existence with\nULU?\nI think quite a lot of good work has been\ngoing on with the links with ULU already. Our\n^campaign on the travelcard issue, I think has\nshown our links with ULU to be quite use-ful. I believe that Matt Hyde has man agr xJ to secure some concessions from London\ntransport - I think I'd definitely want to keep\nup those kind of links, in order to fight as\neffectively as Dave Hellard has been on issues such as that.\nYou spoke out against receiving funding\nfrom companies Involved with oppressive\nregimes. Isthisreallythe remit of Imperial College Union and wont this in fact have a detrimental effect on the students by reducing\nresearch?\nI'm not arguing for a lack of corporate sponsorship, but I think it define t ely has to be\nquestioned. IC research, particularly for British\nAerospace, is being used to kill people-jets\nman a fact u red by British Aerospace were\nused extensively in Last Timor, where a quarter ol the population was killed. I think that\nwe should perhaps be looking to companies\nwith considerably better human rights\nrecords to fund our college.\nWould you do this to the detriment of the\nstudents?\nI'm not going to come down hard and leave\nus un funded, but the te definitely are companies which have considerably better\nrecords that are going to want to fund\nresearch at IC.\nHow do you think you 'll ease the burden of\niM ng In London for students?\nPublicising the hardship fund is obvious f/a big thing - there's been talk from Dave Hellard about the lack of take upon that, so I think an occasional mention in Felix isn't enough to advertise that fully. I think the London Transport issue is quite important, I myself live in zone2 and it costs me sixty\npounds extra just because the card took\nthree months to come through. I think that' s unacceptable. I think the campaign against\nfees is particularly important; I'm definitely not\nturning my back on it. IVe got an excellent\nrecord in fighting against that - I'm probably\nthe only candidate that has that kind of\nexperience in that fight.\n\n"

    "content": "2 8\n^T^v^ Games 22 February 1999\nBaldur's Gate (PC)\nInterplay\n\"Come weary traveller - sit by the fire and rest and I will tell you stories of the dreaded games drought of99 and how our beloved Games Editor saved his pe ople with the game called Baldur's Gate.\"\nBlimey, a new game. Something of a radical change in policy for the games page we know, but here at Felix we have\nnever been afraid to take such leaps of faith. Baldur's Gate was released back in\nJanuary, accompanied by a lack of publicity that made Howard Hughes seem like a media hog. Usually the acronym RPG is enough to send a good fifty percent of PC gamers\nscurrying for cover (well especially the ones where RPG means Rocket Propelled\nGrenade, or is that just my paranoia kicking in - Games Ed). After all RPG is all\nabout people staying up for three days\nand nights solid and eating pot noodles with five or six similar-minded individuals.\nWhen they do finally emerge in the light\nthey look pasty, bemused and tend to\nstand in front of doors for a very long time because they haven't found the magical Amulet of Gori didi um or don't have the necessary dwarven rune. They\nare the trains potters of the gaming world,\nobsessed with hit points, characters classes and notebooks full of hieroglyphics that could have come from Bletchley Park during the war. They are\nalso partaking in one of the oldest forms\nof modern gaming, one that was established long before anyone thought about\nusing the PC as a games machine, and as such deserve far more\n| \u00a7 | respect than they are\noften shown, including\nby mc just now. Baldur's Gate has been developed in conjunction with TSR, own ers of the Advanced Dragons& Dungeons marquee, and claims to\nbe a faithful reproduction of those gaming rules. That's something I can't comment on I 've\nnever played aD&D board game but if\nthat's the case, then the developers( Bioware) have done a very good job of making some extremely complicated rules eminently ign or able. Basically, if\nyou don't want to read through the rules\nsection at the back of the manual, you don't need to - the game will work everything out for you and won't get in the\nway while doing it.\nBaldur's Gate opens in a land that is\nbeginning to come apart at the seams -the major cities in the region are turning\nagainst each other, and there are\nrumours of nasty things lurking in the sur-rounding countryside. You play a little\npipsqueak of an orphan, befriended by\na wizard( or mage to use the correct term in ology). One day, as you play\namongst the chickens, he calls for you and takes you on a journey. En route you are waylaid by a couple of ogres, a witch,\nand a mysterious character\nencased in\narmour. After\na swift but\nbloody fight,\nyour mentor lies bleeding on the ground and you are in\nevery sense of the word, alone.\nFrom that\npoint on you are more or B less left to your owns p devices. During your J* travels you will pick up | | | | |\nvarious quests - in fact fiT\nm this is the backbone of the game, as you travel\naround doing things for fP t|| people and picking up rewards in exchange. Every now and then you will meet a character\nwho will come with you for a while, leaving either\nbecause they are dead, or because you are dead, or because they want to go and do something different from what you want to. There arc all the usual\nraces you expect to find in this kind of games, humans, dwarves, elves, half-in gs, ores, wolves, ogres, and soon. Some of these will try and help you, some of these will try and kill you, and some will just stand around all day talking about the weather. There is a plotline (something about the orphan being the only thing standing between the forces of chaos and order) but you can completely ignore this and go off doing your own thing if you like.\nIt's eminently playable, and Bioware\nhave chosen more traditional top down isometric maps for the graphics rather\nthan the currently fashionable first person\napproach. II works very well, although personally I would have liked the ability\nto shrink the screen a bit;\nit seems a bit\ndaft for the characters to\nbe able to see further\nthan you can every now and again you go off to\ndo something and come back to find yourself\nin the middle of a battle with half of your\ngroup dead. The control method is beautifully simple, completely driven by the mouse, and is extremely easy to pick\nup. My only other gripe is the sound, and in particular the sampled voices.\nIhey have got a lorry-load of third-rate\nAmerican actors in and told them to attempt regional British accents. Do you remember Sean Connery's Brooklyn Irish\naccent in the Untouchables? This is far\nmore irritating.\nThe gameplay is compelling, but also\nvery hard - even on the easiest setting.\nGet into the habit of saving regularly - it's incredibly frustrating to have half-an-hours worth of play wiped out because\nyou spoke to the wrong person in a bar.\nIt's an indication of just how compelling this game is that I kept going back where usually when faced with something like\nthis I'd either give up and go and watch\ntelly or hunt around for some cheat\ncode s.I'm not sure that this game is going to end up a classic. It is however a very\nplayable product, and( due to the close\nlinks with TSR) should have as much in it\nfor previous AD&D players as for beginners. It could even tempt me into joining the serried ranks of RPG addicts,\nalthough I positively absolutely unquestionably refuse to start eating pot noodles. They are the junk food of the devil\nand that way madness lies.\nDanny\nOnline Manga Meyhem : 100,000 Yen for the winner\nHidden by the brilliance of half-life,\nanother first person shooter,' Shogo: Mobile Armor Division', managed to\nmake Game of the Month in the review\npages of PC Gamer. Shogo; MAD is based on the Japanese manga ideals, however instead of fighting dressed in your powered lab\nsuit, they prefer to climb aboard a thirty\nfoot me chan is ed war machine. Obviously these war machines are pretty useless in claus tra phobic tunnels and so you get to fight naked as soon as you get\noff the streets - well perhaps not in the\nbuff but you get the picture.\nMonolith are creating a special net-work level. This though is no back room creation and could win you100,000 Yen.\nWireplay will be hosting four weekly deathmatch sessions( at www. w l re play.co.uk and linked with www. shogo mad. com). The best players will win games from Microids, while those less\ngood will get the chance to get T shirts\nand the soundtrack CD. The very best will get invited\nto the big play offs in London on the 8th of April, where the winner\nwill win the big money prize and a subscription to Edge. Runners\nup will win bundles of forth co ming Microid games and also get to\ndrink I lol sten Pils till they fall over.\nSo register on the wire play site\nbefore the 8th March and win for\nthe glory (and the cash).\n\n"

The best 8 teams in the country will be there fighting it out for the tit-tle, and IC will be one of them. And above all, the team did it in great style,\nsince it hasn't lost a single match throughout the whole year.\nThis is how it all happened. After\ncomfortably getting rid of all the London opposition, it was time for the national playoffs. First a trip to Cranfield was required. Initially the team was left stranded at the train station\nwaiting for a promised ride to the sports centre. However, after waiting for a while, our 'always-on-the-alert'\nchairman( Panos) decided it was time to take the initiative to avoid un plea sant surprises ( we learnt the lesson last\nyear where we were kicked out of the competition without ever losing a game!).\nWe finally got to the place, warmed up and dispatched the opposition nice and easily. The final score was 3-1, but Carlo (our Italian star) was so impressive that at certain points during the match things got really\ndepressing for the opposition. We almost began to feel sorry for them. Almost. Then along bus journey to play\nUW Cardiff in the second knock-out\nmatch. Here things got tougher. Travelling tiredness was evident in some of our players and we only managed victory by a32 score line. On top of that,\nour captain Perrick got injured and some improvisation was needed to\nreorganise the team to make up for his\nabsence. But don't be fooled, it was-n't that hard really - we were just too good for them. With this latest score, ICU Volley\nClub got a dream-ticket to the finals\nand will now be playing for the title of best in the UK. Our top Greek intern at ional player ( Simo s) has already made himself available for the three\nday tournament; superman Carlo will\nbe there as well; crazy German Michael is ready to tease opponents and strange screaming Ming will do the setting. And then there's still a big bunch of top quality players to make further damage such as Stephan, Perrick, Pano s, Marko, Rui, Stephane... So, in a nutshell, we're going there\nto win and that's about it! Ar ewe arrogant? No way, just really, really conf i dent...\nHOCKEY\nRebels take on the Evil Empire\nIC II 3-2 UCL II\nAs the eighth sun rose over the moon of H arlington, the rebels looked to\ntheir leader Luke Skywalker (aka Jean\nClaude) for inspiration. Skywalker stood firm with lights abr c/hock cy stick\nbrandished high. Princess Liya had been shagging Darf Vader, and it was time for revenge. The war started triumphantly. Bermuda triangle disappeared and reappeared on their goal line to make the initial impact. The Death Star did not like this much; Darf Vader let loose\nhis cannons. Chu baka( Phil) had waxed his legs the night before but this\nsuper smoothness was not matched by any of the X wings and Tie lighter. He shoved one right in their core. that's when the Death Star exploded. the shit hit the fan; they came at\nus left right and centre Skywalker,\nYoda, Obi WanK c nobi, Jab a the Hutbut C3P0 couldn't control the onslaught as wave after wave of Storm\nTroopers attacked and scored two. It was two all, but the fun had only just begun; with a swift tactical\nman ou ver, Lp is ode1 was released, stunning the Evil Empire. The Rebels\ncame back harder, with R2D2 adding the final touch of class - his antennae picked up the vibrations from Vader's sleeping chambers and shoved one in\nthere.\nthe Rebels won.

As the largest\nstudent relay in Europe, teams arrived\nfrom as far a field as Sweden and Poland, and as close to home as Kings\n(gr rrr). Hours of meticulous planning and perfect preparation, coupled with the legendary glorious weather( at no extra cost) ensured a highly successful day.\nThe old enemies Cambridge and Oxford won the men's and women's events respectively. University of fond on finished fourth with five out of six\nof their runners coming from Imperial,\nwhilst the remaining Imperial teams having been ravaged by UL Use lec tion, flu and latecomers were placed strategically throughout the field, in\n16th,34 than d42nd. True to form, we were once again unable to field a women' steam we can only guess at the reason why. However, the women' sULU team. Including IC's Bethan, finished an awesome fourth, \"the highlight of the womens race was the Swedish teams desire to get changed in front of500 male runners...\nThe presentation and food went off smoothly, before everyone went to\nthe Union to embarrass the night away. The volatile combination of half\ncut runners and a school Valentines Ball led to predictable( if not amusing) results.\nImperial has yet again established itself as the focus of student running in Europe, thanks to a brilliantly organised and attended race. A big thank\nyou must go out to all those involved. See you next year.\n\n"

So the thirds ease into\nthe Quarter finals. Luckily, we'd also\narranged to play KCL II (always a good idea\nto have a spare opposition lying around) -who were a tougher proposition.\nBut the thirds are starting to play some\ndecent football.

No case\nand no sleeve equal no information\nin my book. Alright, they have generously printed the name of the album on the CD along with the tracks but c'm on, throw me a freak in' bone here!\nSebadoh haven't really decided what\nstyle of music they fit into. Is it alternative? AOR? Grunge( is that dead yet)?\nWell, urn, it's all of the above. And they've got lots to practice on what with\na whole fifteen tracks on the album. I often find that this is a double-edged\nsword though. You have the conflict of quantity and quality (do you remember English essays, 'But miss, how much do we have to write?'), but Seb a doh have\nmanaged both aspects rather well.\nCall me jaded but haven't we heard\nthis all before? I can hear an early\nnineties sound in this album: the discordant guitars, that hi-hat/ snare drumming and the songs with loud, punchy,\nhigh-energy choruses and moody, introspective verses. You can hear so many\nother bands in this music. On Love Is\nStronger you have an early R.E.M. Nick\nOf Time Is reminiscent of a more musically gifted Jesus Lizard. And free would sound like Blur's new single Tender, if\nBlur had bothered to write their own stuff and not rip it off the likes of U2 and Bush.\nBird In The Hand is an outstanding\ntrack simply because they have the balls\nto blatantly take off Nirvana and the Pixies in one fell swoop. Fantastic. So Long\nalso strikes a chord with me purely due to the fact that it shows these guys can\nrock out, man. Indeed.\nI guess I'm a bit stunned. I genuinely enjoyed listening to this. Sure,\nwe've heard most of it before and it's not\nnew, but I like it. Hey, you can' play air-guitar to it for God's sake. So is this what\nNirvana would have evolved into if Kurt\nhadn't died (mysterious circumstances or\notherwise)? Would we have seen Nirv an a along with Seb a doh on the next\nfriends soundtrack? Adult Orientated Rock anybody? El\nChristian\nFREDDY FRESH\nLast True Family Man\nThere's something fishy\ngoing on here.\nWhile Fatboy Slim maybe Big\nBeat's Num ero Uno, Freddy\nFresh retains the title for most\nprolific mix master. This new album weighs in at a positively anorexic 22\ntunes (his earlier Essential Mix total led 2\nhours and105 tracks!).\nMr. Fresh follows the Big Beat form ul a( which he admittedly had a hand in inventing) to the letter - throwing in\nscratchy looped vocals, funky hook lines\nand humungous beats. Yes it's definitely\nspeaker melting time!\nIn order to add a bit of variety Freddy\nsensibly let his pals contribute a couple of tracks. Ironically, these turned out to\nbe the best on the album. Contributors\ninclude The FreeStylers and naturally Mr. Slim himself. Freddy seems to produce his funkiest compositions when working with other peoples material as a base or\nsomeone else to bounce Ideas off.\nIt is clear that this man know show to wield a sampler, he even appears to\nhave eavesdropped on a couple of phone conversations. If it makes sound, Freddy will nick it and loop it. Another\nhighlight is what seems to be his random\ntuning of a South American radio - mixing static and random adverts.\nTalking of South America, Freddy\npays his respects to his Puerto Rican\nroots with some Bossa Nova beats and sambar y th m s.He certainly know show to get a conga going! Admittedly, my Puerto Rican isn't up to much but most\nof the samples appear to revolve around\nthe fact that he is Puerto Rican. This is\nproclaimed by various voices, including\nthe deepest sounding voice I have heard\nthis side of Issac Hayes. This bass y sounding dude is featured again in another of the top tracks of the album Its About The\nGroove. Nice sh. Ail in all this album sticks to the rules\nand produces a funky, latin sounding twist on the big beat sound. If you are a Fresh acolyte this will be right up your\nstreet as its more of the same. How ever, if you are new to big beat I would recommend dipping your toe in the pool\nwith a Fatboy Slim album instead.\nFresh and funky but there is better\nout there, d Joel\n\n"

    "content": "14 Elections 99/00 - Interviews 22 February 1999\nDP (Finame & Servites)\nt Robert Walker\nHow would you assess your personal\nmanagement of your own money?\nI just spend it willy-n illy actually.\nIdo have a vague budget for my own money, but I just spend it on beer. So why should we entrust our money\nto you?\nBecause I have got an economics A level, I have done business studies GCSE; Ido actually know what I'm doing I'm just very free with my own money. With other people's money, however, I'm very conscientious. How would you Improve current\nfinancial management?\n^ By giving all club treasurers and chairs the training that most of them received this year and also making the financial regulations clearer and better understandable and not having\ncontradictions in the finance manual. You Intend to get more money from College how do you Intend togo about this?\nBy having properly justified bud gets, also by pointing out lo them why the students need more money because wear can integral part of the\ncollege and we need to provide the services for our students.\nHow do you think that students should be more aware of the col-leg e's financial status and how would\nyou broaden the knowledge of stu-dents?\nBy letting all the club treasurers\nand chairs know about the financial regulations, also by making Council more approachable by the student body than it currently is, so they can come and listen to the reports we Ian Clifford\nIn your manifesto you stated that you\nwant Union training for various Union\nmembers. What areas need to be\nstrengthened?\nI'm principally talking about training\nfor treasurers because it's important that\ntreasurers know the financial regulations.\nThere have been a lot of problems this\nyear with the Union clubs and in particular the medical clubs because they simply\nhaven't known what the regulations are\nand what the Union's rules are regarding\npayments and getting money back. So a lot of, for example, medical clubs have\nfound that they haven't got the money because nobody knew they'd paid it in.\nWhat kind of financial experience do you\nhave?\nIam currently the treasurer of the City\nand Guilds College Union. As treasurer I have to deal with a lot of matters concerning the clubs of C& GU, the departmental societies, the Motor Club, the\nKarting section, the Rugby Club, and in\nsuch respect I have to know the ins and\nouts of the Union. I have also worked in\nthe Union so I have some idea of the\nmoney that goes through the Union and the services it provides.\nA point of te cent contention has been the\nArt Society's sub sidi sed trips. What's your\nstance on this and what are you going to do about it?\nPeople have a lot of contention about\nthe Arts Society simply because; people\nfeel that it's unfair that they should get a large amount of money for their members\nto goon trips, whereas members of other\nsocieties have gone on trips and found\nthat they haven't got money for the\nevents. I feel that as a sock tty that is specifically aimed at funding appreciation of the\narts, they should get some i un ding, but I also feel that they should aim for some kind of external funding, either in sponsorship or in reductions from the th io ls there anything that you would do to\ndramatically change the money allotment\nsystem?\nThere arc a lot of things you could\npossibly do. At the moment I haven't got\nany dramatic changes planned, possibly\nlooking more at what the clubs aim to do.\nThey should really try and bid and say\n\"we've done this this and this, and we intend to do this in the future.\" That way,\nyou can say where a club is going. A lot\nof clubs arc on the verge of closing or just\ntinkering over - it is important to see that\npeople have got vision. If people have got\nvision then clubs can go far - it's not just\nthe fact that clubs are doing things that is\nimportant.\nDo you Intend to wear a skirt every day if\nyou get the Job?\nNo, I don't!^ Paul Hickman\nYou want a stricter enforcement of the\nsubsidy rules for clubs and societies.\nWhich clubs are you referring to specifically, and how do you intend to address\nthese Issues?\nI don't really want to give specific\nexamples, but I was trying to make the\npoint that the rules are there because\nthere's only so much money to go around, and I want to make sure that\neveryone gets a fair crack of the whip, and\ngets the money that they deserve. Obviously there may be exceptional c irc um stances, but that's what the capital\nexpenditure fund is for.\nHow do you see your role in supporting\nthe president and other sabbaticals?\nI'm not really sure what you're asking,\nI'm there to be responsible to the president for finances and services, but If the\nother sabbaticals have got an v questions\nto do with finances and services, then I 'll\nbe there to help them as needed.\nDo you feel that the current Union services are adequate for the students' needs\nor are there any gaps and, if so, how do\nyou intend to fill them?\nGaps... difficult to say, really. I'm hoping that the results of the focus groups that\narc occurring at the moment will tell me whether there are any gaps that need to be\naddressed and, if so, I 'll try and look at filling them if possible. It may be that the services people want just aren't affordable.\nBut on those focus groups we understand that you feel you've been hard\ndone by - one Union official has In fact\nstolen your Idea\n1 wouldn't say stolen my idea - to\nhave stolen it he would have had to ha\\ e known I had it It was an idea I had in mind\nwhen I was thinking about standing, it just\nhappened that I was beaten to it - which\nis good. The Union is trying to provide the;\nservices people want and listen to what\npeople want.\nWhat financial experience do you have\nand how will you apply your knowledge?\nI understand what the Union financial\nregulations are. I did get caught out at the\nhustings on one question, but I think that\nwas more mental block on stage than\nanything else: I knew then answer and was\nquite upset that I caught out. I know how\nthe finances work, but I haven't actually\nbeen a club treasurer, I 'll be honest on that,\nbut I do know what the rules and regulations are around the Union, and I believe\nI can help people to understand them.\nDo you feel that financial resources are\nfreely accessible to students at the\nmoment?\nI believe most clubs get a fair subsidy\nfrom the budgeting round, but obviously\nas DPtF&S)I would be on the budget\nadvisory group and UFC to help make sure\nthat if people do have a specific need we\ncan sort out that problem.\n\n"

    "content": "30 Sport 22 February 1999\nRUGBY\nImperial Medics 2nd XV through to\nBUSA cup quarter finals\nSaturday 13th February saw the medics2 nd XV breaking new barriers for the club by beating Newcastle 1 8 - 1 2 away to earn a place in the last 8 of the BUSA\n2nd XV cup competition. Having com e2nd in the Southern\nPremiership, and therefore gained a bye\ninto the last 16 of the cup, the2 nd XV\nhad not played any student rugby since\nbefore Christmas, with the only games of'99 being punching matches with fat, old men! However, true to medics tradition,\nthe game was played with guts founded on the pride that is held in the club and in the medical school.\nIn the first half the medics had the advantage of a slight slope, and after\ndominating Newcastle' s much larger\npack for the first 15 minutes, a brief lack\nof concentration in the medics defence allowed Newcastle to break free, a mistake which eventually cost the medics a converted penalty try. Not to be out-done, the medics responded quickly\nwith a fantastic try from1 st year Rob Jeffs,\nand when the half time whistle blew the medics were57 down. The medics pack started the second half without the same ferocity and bloody mindedness In the ruc k and the maul that they had shown in the first half\nand it was not long before the New cas tle pack pushed the medics back over\ntheir line to increase their lead to 5 -12.\nThe following15 minutes saw3 penalty\nkicks at goal. Two were by the medics\nnumber10, Louis Grand jean, which sailed cleanly through the posts, fortunately the Newcastle kicker did not have\nthe same fortune.\nWith 10 minutes remaining New castle had a1 point advantage, but in the\nclosing minutes the medics dug deep. They were justly rewarded when Nick\nEnzel cut back on a dummy, before passing to Si Jones who broke away down the\nline, and having committed the New castle full back, gave a try scoring pass\nto Jim Fielding. Lois Grandjean converted.\nThe team was: S. Church, J. Fielding, S. Jones, N.t nz el, J. Kinross, L. Grandjean,\nA. Morris, P. Johnson, J. Langdon, W, Gels on, B. Tuff (c), Demetri, R. Jeffs, Zu,\nG. Morton. Subs: 'Lucky', O.S cd don, N. Taff, J. Apsey.\nNever before has a medics side\nreached the last 8 in the BUSA cup com petition, but it has finally happened, not\nthrough having the better individuals, but\nbecause the medics team spirit shone through.\" The lobster will never be boiled.\"\nRIDING\nFirst ever championship sees Imperial\nRiding placed fourth\nThe Riding team is a new team for Imperial. For the first time ever we went out as a team in four regional competitions.\nThe competitions entail both show j um ping (at three foot) and dressage disciplines. Unfortunately we were picked to\nbe in BUSA groups that had some of the\nbest teams in the country. Nonetheless we have not been disheartened as it\nwas a good effort from all and brilliant\nfun.\nThe first show was on Royal Vets\nground near Watford. The dressage did-n't go too well due to our nerves - however we trashed the other teams in the jumping, with three clears and one refusal. Lucy (the horse in timid at or) took\non the horse that had dumped the demonstrator. Cathy went round at\n90mph, got a clear round, but at the end the steering went a bit wrong and ended up leaving with some fence work still\nattached. Rachel was brilliant, but we were worried when she had a disagree-ment with the horse in mid air.\nWeek two saw us hosting our own show at the Belmont riding centre. This\ntime the dressage was fantastic, seeing Diana in second place. The jumping, however, was a disaster. Kathy as usual\nhad a clear round no problems there.\nDiana then clocked up an impressive 30\npenalty points. Rachel had an unlucky\nknock down, while the other Rachel had\nto be carted off after being mauled by a wild pony monster.\nThe positions for the third show were\nstarting to get a bit tight. It was time to\nput on a good show at UCL. Unfortunately Kathy was put on an express train\nfor the dressage. Rachel injured her leg\nand forgot the test half way through. As\nit always goes, you can never have it\nboth ways. We got three smashing clear\nrounds in the jumping. Zoe almost got us\na fourth but the hose decided to sit down on the last fence.\nIt was the final show for us on Royal\nHolloway territory would not get in to the\nSouth of England shows but we would definitely go out with a bang. Rachel\nwas so drugged upon pain killers from her injured leg that she fell asleep during\nthe dressage. Diana followed suit and also did the wrong test, but Kath and Zoe compensated with beautiful dressage\ntests. Rachel couldn't compete in j um ping because of her leg. Zoe and Kath\nrode clear rounds. Then, fright cn ingly, Diana fell off a beast called Womb le. Our final position was fourth place.\nWell done girls, and better luck next year\nwhen we will have two teams.\nRachel Green\nSTREET HOCKEY\nThe/re new, they\"re fast, and they're on the verge of success\nMeeting very early on a Sunday morning,\nthe ICU Street Hockey Team( we haven't thought of a nickname yet) assembled a few members short. We were lacking the\ndazzling skills of Vicent and Baz as we thought that they must have still been in\nbed. It didn't make our chances seem too good as we headed for our first tournament with only seven players. We arrived\nat Warwick knowing that our chances did\nnot seem so good with so few players -a normal team has four players and a keeper with rolling subs.\nWe played our first match against\nEdinburgh Uni,on the tournament pitch\nwhich was a third of the size and more slippery surface than the one we're used to.\nThe first game was scrappy and very disorganised for our team as we adjusted to\nthe surface. Our inexperience in \"serious\"\nmatches showed as our keeper Teena played well but was not used to high\nvelocity balls being fired at her face. As a result of this we lost the first match quite\ndrastically. Luckily at the end of the match,\nWarwick offered us their third keeper as\nwe didn't have our own goalie equip ment and he did. Our thanks to Ben for\nplaying with us for the rest of the matches.\nThere was a no the t surprise for us as Baz\nshowed, having got the train up despite\nmissing his lift to the tournament.\nThings were looking up as we headed\ninto our next game against the Newcastle Wildcats, who looked as though they'd be aggressive, but turned out to be fine.\nWe played a lot better with g oo d runs from\nOng and Andy leading to an excellent\ngoal. The defence started playing a lot better with Ket, Teena and Matt rarely failing\nin keeping their attackers at bay. Lise used\nher extensive knowledge of the game to\norganise the team throughout, despite\nnot feeling too well, leading to our better\nresults. Unfortunately our players still tired\na little at the end and the Wildcats got an\nequalise r in the final minute. A well played\ngame nonetheless.\nThe next games' that followed were against the Birmingham Beavers, Leeds\nUni and Warwick Uni. The Beavers played\na very rough game with tactics like body\nbarging (such as Mo into our goal via his\nface), and despite losing we played well.\nLeeds played extremely well and though our man-to-man marking really seemed to\nclose up their game they still had the experience to win, and eventually did so.\nWarwick Uni also played very well, and beat us to come second. Our final game was against Cam bridge, and we needed to win it to come sixth, and it had to be by a very large goal\nmargin of seven to come fifth. We started\noff well, but quickly became quite crap as\nfatigue set into our team. It was a scrappy\ngame that we should have won easily, but\nonly won32. We came sixth out of eight,\nwhich isn't bad for a team that the DP\n(C&S) didn't know existed until last\nWednesday.\nAll in all we did very well for our first\ncompetition with our limited amount of\nplayers and the fact that we were a mixed\nteam. This is hopefully the first of many\ncompetitions that are being set up, and we want to go to as many as possible. We'd like to thank Ncrissa for driving some of\nus down, getting food at lunchtime and\nbeing our only non-playing supporter. If\nthere are any ex or current street/ice\nhockey players who would like to join and play, or any skaters who' d like to try it out,\nthen email: m. manso ori@ ic.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "News 22 February 1999\n\"Probably the most stylish man in College\"\nBy Sanjay Sik dar Photo: Alikl Dr Paul Ewing demonstrates his natty line In bow ties.\nThe City & Guilds College Union centenary lecture series continued last\nweek with Dr Paul E wing's highly popular talk on the history of the car.\nDr. Ewing who has previously been described as \" probably the most stylish man in college\"( a title given by his\nstudents), had his status further enhanced as he parked his vintage Morgan and Lotus Esprit in front of the Mechanical Engineering entrance. Primarily focussing on cars, his lecture\nincluded other forms of transport, particularly the steam trains whom he recalled which a great deal more elegant and reliable than today's re in car nations.\nDr E wing's talk covered several themes such as the many British firsts\nthat took place in the world of motor ing. The first motorcar race on earth\noccurred in Bexhill-on-Sea. Brook lands was the world's first ever specialised racing circuit. The opulence of the events there were comparable to Ascot\nwhilst the almost vertical banked curves\npromised a heart stopping ride. In ref-e rence to the recently established land\nspeed record by the ThrustSCC jet car\nin North America, Dr Ewing told the audience of the many past land speed milestone records that had fallen to\nBritons.\nThe IC lecturer also entertained the gathered throng with anecdotes about the differences in driving styles of Stirling Moss and Graeme Hill, as well as\nthe sad tale of Eleanor Thornton, the model for the flying lady on the Rolls\nRoyce, who tragically drowned during a torpedo attack during World War I. Inconsiderate elements of S her field bureaucracy who deemed the innocuous cars outside a fire hazard rudely\ninterrupted the multimedia presentation. Unruffled, Dr Ewing continued the tempo by mentioning the wind tunnel testing that occurred in the IC's Aeronautics department during the development of Jaguar's XJ220.\nThe self styled doctor raised several\nemerging trends during this past century of motoring such as the recent\nfem in is ation of the consumer car from\nthe testosterone charged machine. He\ncited the metamorphosis of the Vauxhall's Nova to the curvier Corsa in order\nto attract the larger number of women drivers that exist today. He also referred\nto the bygone days when drinking and driving were very much intertwined and acceptable pastimes. People would get truly \" s ozz led\" and it was not till\nrecently that alcohol was seen as such\na menace to road safety. Although it\noccurred at the beginning of the talk,\nthe opening mountain route sequences to the film 'The Italian Job'\nsummed up where Dr Ewing's philosophy and love of cars stemmed from.\n' Delicious car, delicious weather, deli-cio us scenery.'\nDUNCAN FIELD\nFOR\nDP(C&S) More than one issue -Only one solution:\nC&S administration\ndriven by ideology, tempered with realism.\nmm\n' if;..:\nHM H BBB V:w \u00a7mim\n.... \u2022\nVoting - all departments Mon 22nd/ Tue 23rd Feb\nAll you need is a union card and an opinion\nYOUR UNION - YOUR VOTE:\nMAKE A DIFFERENCE\nThe Linux Effect\nIn recent months significant media attention has By M afC been given to Linux, a computer operating system (OS), which is\nsurprising, considering that the juxtaposition of the words' computer',' operating' and' system' pro ball y mean nothing to the maj our it y of pe o ple. If this includes you, then an OS is\nthe piece of software which controls\naccess to a computer's hardware; eg it's memory, processor (eg a Pentium\nchip), hard disk, keyboard, graphics\ncard etc.\nAnOS is a very complex piece of software, but makes the job of people writing software for a computer, eg a word processor or game, a lot easier.\nThe OS running on most computers is\nMicrosoft Windows, which has a90% market share, (the majority of the rest\nbeing Macintoshes, which have their\nown OS), whilst only 2 % run Linux.\nLinux is ava irian t of UNIX, anOS developed in the70 s, which became the industry standard for use on the mainframe comp ute rs of the time and is still in use today for serious applications. The first PCs were much less\npowerful than the mainframes, so needed a smaller OS, and issues of re lia bil iy and efficiency were less imp or tant, so Microsoft' sDOS, and later\nWindows was a suitable substitute. But\nas PCs became more com BrOS term on place, not everyone wanted to use Windows, which led to the development of Linux,\na version of UNIX designed to run on a PC.\nIf you' ve ever used Windows95/98, then chances are you're familiar with the' Blue screen of death', -with Linux, that simply doesn't happen.\nEven if a program fails, it doesn't bring\nthe entire computer down with it.\nMore importantly, Linux is consider bly more efficient than Windows, requiring much less memory and processor\npower, which means everything runs\nfaster. Windows NT is more reliable\nthan 95/98, but isn't as fast as Linux.\nSecondly, Linux is far more flexible\nthan Windows most Linux software is\ncustomise able to near-ridiculous levels.\nYou want E9 to comment on the current line when you're programming but add an attac he ment when you're\nsending mail? That's fine.\nLinux was and is developed by a group of hackers/geeks who did the work out of the fun of it, so a copy of\nLinux will cost you the price of distributing the CD and manuals, or can be\ndownloaded for nothing from the net.\nSee gnu. org for more details, or check\nout www. mall net. co. uk/~ marc/ linux "

If they were expecting a tense night of political thrills\nand deep issues, they would have been disappointed, however. There seemed little to distinguish most of the candidates\non what are felt to be the major issues facing the Union: minibuses, BUSA, club\nfunding, C CU identity and soon. There was a similar feel to the St.\nMary's Hustings, traditionally a much harsher session. There were more probing questions from the sixty or so students\nthere - particularly over BUSA, Glaxo's proposed takeover of part of the Medical School (reported below) and problems\nrelated to the Medicine course - but the\noverall atmosphere was more subdued than had been expected.\nThe Charring Cross Hustings on TuesBy Gareth Morgan\nPhoto: Allkl\nday were poorly attended - probably due\nto a party at the same time. One candidate remarked that it was \"very dull and\nvery pointless\".\nUp first were Dave Roberts and Kevin\nButcher, the only candidates standing for\nThe Presidential hopefuls sink their pints\nFelix Editor and DP (E&W) respectively.\nHaving set out their promises, they fielded\nquestions from the floor. Dave was strongly in favour of editorial freedom, and defended Felix's role as a club. Kevin\nidentified some specific issues, but admitted that deep-seated attitudes would take\nsome lime to change. He was receptive\nto new ideas, such as a counsellor for the\nmedical campuses.\nBoth went down fairly well with the\ncrowds, although Kevin received an initially harsh reception at Mary's. Best\nquote? Kevin's \"IQ are a tight bunch of\npeople\" at Mary's was an unfortunate slip.\nThe candidates for DP(C& S) were next. Most of the differences between\nTim Traitor and Duncan Field seemed to\nbe on their different (sporting and non-sporting) backgrounds. One argument\nruns that the major issues such as BUSA\nneed someone familiar with the sports\nteams. On the other hand, only about a quarter of the clubs are sports teams, and\nthe DP (C&S) needs to look after the interests of all of the clubs.\nBoth promised to fight for dual rather\nthan single entry of Medic teams into\nBUSA, with Tim preferring to keep the cur-Continued on Page 2\nGlaxo Welcome Mary's Rumours of a massive proposed deal between College and Gla xo Welcome have finally been confirmed this week, with senior IC School of Medicine staff\nadmitting that Gla xo have offered \u00a320\nmillion for four floors at the St Mary's site.\nWhilst the precise details of the offer still remain unknown, it seems certain that the current proposal would include the basement of the St Mary's building which presently houses Union Offices, a swimming pool and Gladys, the St Mary's bar. Additionally, the main library (a massive collection of medical texts) would be almost certain to go, as it lies in the centre of the building. The biggest concern about the pro-pos als, however, is with the process of notification. Senior Union figures first\nheard rumours of the sale via other students and leaks last month, and official\nadmission of the bid only came in\nresponse to direct questioning. Thus,\nICS M Union President Wade Gaye d has, un surprisingly, expressed his fears\nBy David Roberts\nthat the Union( and thus the students)\nwould only have been informed \"after\na decision had been made\". College figures, however, insist that such a decision could not be taken on a wide-scale without full discussion amongst both staff and students.\nThe exact reasoning behind the bid is also unclear. Undoubtedly the price under offer is very high particularly when considering that Gla xo would then have to gut the entire building and re-model it. As a result,\ntheir motivation is being treated with\nthe utmost suspicion. Some suggest that it is a move to regain an animal house for IC pharmaceutical and genetic research (the present stock of animals must be moved out of the Beit Basements, but BMS is rumoured to have been restricted by a licence\nwhich only allows small rodents up to\nthe size of an average hamster to be kept. In turn the massive funding generated by the sale could be used to fund the costs incurred by the merger( including the \u00a39.6m overspend on the BMS building itself).\nAs a result of pressure from the Union, senior Med School figures have\npromised to protect Gladys and the swimming pool( which the College regard as tangible assets). This is likely\nto mean trying to alter the plan so that\nGla xo are offered the top three floors.\nWhilst this would still result in the loss\nof the fi bra ry, it would protect the integrity of Gladys. However, many medical students have expressed doubt over the likelihood of such a plan succeeding retaining a student bar under a state-of-the-art research\nfacility would hardly seem to make good sense, from Gla xo' s point of view.\n\u2022 This is a very emotive issue - particularly for older St Mary's students and it will undoubtedly run and run.\nIndeed it was a source of questions for\nthe candidates for Union President\n(see page2).

The eventual\nscore was once again 5 - 4 , despite\nthe fact that we had trashed all the\nprevious foil teams decisively before.\nDespite the fact that Henry the Jock\nappeared to be dying of TB, he still\nmanaged to win one fight, Eddie\n\"Crazy Legs\" and Karaoke Dave \"APK\"\n(who seemed to be hungover) each\nwon two of their three fights to take\nvictory by the narrowest of margins.\nLastly came e pee, traditionally our\nweakest weapon, with Cambridge\ngloating, as it seemed to be their\nstrongest weapon. We only had a marginal lead and had to win four fights\nto claim the victory. First up was Rob\n\"Big Daddy,\" our German import. After\nwhat was the longest fight of the day.\nhe won to the great relief of our\nwatching supporters. Next up was\nNige, the Old Geezer, who after his\nrecent practice session last week was\nback to his top form, winning his fight.\nAfter losing this second e pee fight, a look of worry started to appear on the\nfaces of the Cambridge team. Our\nthird e pee is t was Crazy Legs who performed a lot better than in his foil\nfights to win - we only needed one\nmore fight to seal the victory. Big\nDaddy was up again, and didn't seem\nto break sweat as he won his fight to\nsecure our place in the BUSA finals.\nInspired by this the rest of our e pee team won all their remaining fights.\nThey had been crushed by our\ne pee is ts with a90 victory, the first\nin living memory for the IC e pee team.\nWhat had earlier seemed a challenging and close-run contest suddenly ran-out as a198 victory, which\ncarries us through to the last four in\nthe country. Next stop, the Finals.\nBOATCLUB\nOn a very cold Saturday morning, the\nWomen's Squad travelled North to Peterborough, for the first Head Race of the\nyear. The women's first eight won their\ndivision and were the second fastest\nwomen's eight overall, beaten only by a Scottish national squad crew. The second\neight also won their division by a large\nmargin, despite putting the rig gers on in\nthe wrong order. They doubled up to race\nin a cox ed four, easily winning their division and in fact finishing as the fastest\nwomens four of the day.\nThe boys, despite forgetting their\nrig gers and borrowing a boat, were\nunlucky to be beaten by a suspicious\nBedford Star crew, but were the seventh\nfastest mens crew overall, an extremly\nrespectable placing for last years novices.\nA promising start to 1999.\nNIGHT-HIKE\nOver the night of 12-13 February, nine\nteams of intrepid students set out to\nwalk a fifteen mile course around the Sussex Downs. The teams, composed of\nthree or four students, competed for the\nfastest time through nine checkpoints.\nThe event, organised by RCC treasurer Mat Collins, was a great success.\nFortunately for the teams, the weather,\nalthough cold, remained reasonably\npleasant all night,-although there were\nstill traces of snow on the hills. There was\na lot of mud around, but this was the\nworst the terrain had to offer. The highlight of the night for many was the fried\nbreakfast cooked early on Saturday morn-ing.\nAll but one of the teams finished the\ncourse: No. 9, a team of ICU footballers,\nwere forced to drop out after one mem-ber, Marie Nicholaou - the Union Deputy\nPresident - injured her leg. The fastest\ntime was an incredible 4 hours 35 min-ute s, from Three Jerks and a Squirt; canoe\nclub members Nigel Thacker, Will Blakeman and Nick Owens.\nOf the two CCU teams competing,\nCGCU finished sixth overall, with a time\nof 6 hours 57 minutes - 68 minutes\nfaster than the RCS team, who finished\neighth. Other teams represented the\nFellwanderers, Rifle and Pistol, and Orienteering clubs.\nULTIMATE FR1SBEE\nIC 21-5PD Q ICs first match of the south-east ultimate\nfrisbee league ended in a storming vic-tory. The score does not fully credit\nPortsmouth, and we were lucky to come\naway with such a convincing victory.\nAside from the usual godliness of 'Wor-ship me', 'Who?' and 'Roadrunter', there\nwas an excellent individual performance\nfrom 'Jesus' (after the addition of some\nglue to his hands at half time). This was\nan encouraging start to the season, but\ndefinitely some areas to work on.\nBetter conditions and a full team\nshould help for the next match against\nthe south-east indoor championship win-ner s, Southampton Uni, next Wednesday.\nCROSS COUNTRY\nWe realised our team was thoroughly\nshagged when no-one turned up at the\nunion, our team was ravaged by colds, flu\nand the previous weekends excesses.\nHowever, ten men managed to complete the course with Bennyboy sandwiched by Brunei in 5th and Jodie In\n11th The rest of the team trailed in with\nonly Angus 23rd( pulling off a decent\nrun). He was followed by Dave in 29th and Paul in 30th. The rest of the team suffered on the mud with Mike turning his\nankle, Gavin suffering a heart attack and\nGiles and Marcos choosing to leave the\nspikes at home. The race was awesome\nfor team spirit, if not for points gained.\nThe slackers with colds have no excuse.\nAround IC\nMon 22 Tues 23 Wed 24 Thurs 25 Fri 26 Sat 27 Sun 28\nICU Voting - all departments 10am5 pm CGCU Officer nomination papers up today\nEnts Focus Group Meeting - dB's5.30pm CAG: Tools for Self\nReliance, Basement of\nBeit Quad 6pm Environmental SocietyPhysics LT2 6pm ICU Cinema: Rush Hour,\n6pm, Blade, 8.30pm Union Concert Hall\nICU Voting - all departments 10am5 pm STA Quiz NightDaVinci's8pm CAG: Soup Run, Basement Kitchen, Weeks\nHall 8pm Lecture: \"Third World\nDebt: the health crisis of\nthe 90's?\" Physics Lecture\nTheatre, St Mary's6.30pm ICU Cinema: Blade,\n6pm, Rush Hour,\n8.30pm UCH\nfelix Election Special\nLinux SymposiumRoom 308, Huxley Building 2pm Club XS, ICU, FREE\n9pm1 am CAG: Soup Run, Basement Kitchen, Weeks\nHall 8pm Cocktail Night, DaVinci's511 pm\nExploration Society Lecture \"Top to Toe\", Room\n201, Civ Eng 12.30pm The Common PeopleICU \u00a31 9pm2 am "

Could you Justify the costs of operating outside this realm given the loss of\ndiscounts and suchlike?\nOK, basically, ULU; I believe that Imperial\nCollege should be a major player in ULU.I believe that as President I should be\ninvolved in actively developing and reorganising ULU in to the next century. People may say that ULU is a waste of money.\nOn the sporting side of things - if we were to d is affiliate from UL U( hen we would lose all our sporting fixtures against\nmajor colleges, and these are some of the\nkey games we look forward to. It's the representation of the students as well that's important. With UL Uwe need to have a voice for the students of London, basically\n- if Imperial College were to go it alone we would lose out on so much. Currently\nthere is an issue with London Transport\nand this would never have been raised\nwith the sole backing of Imperial College.\nWhat do you think of the new expansion\nplans of Imperial to Include other col-leg es? I feel lh at expanding Imperial College to\nencapsulate Wye College, which is the\nissue you're raising there, is good because\nit provides a no the t angle, it brings more\nstudents into Ihe college. As for the organisational aspect, I believe that it shouldn't be too much of a problem to bring these?\nstudents in. It's in a similar situation to Silw ood Park, and as president it will be for\nme to organise it in such a way that these\npeople don't feel isolated. I know from\npersonal experience, as captain of the\nfootball club, that people from Silwood\nPark do feel isolated. I have tried to bring\ntheir footballing team together with IC this\nyear - it's kind of this communication that's very important.\nYou spoke of being football club captain\n- there were several tribunals last year\nthat you were In some way Involved In;\nwhat have you learnt from this experience\nand how have you changed in order to\nprepare yourself for being President?\nlast year I was captain of the fourths'\nteam, and I was involved with a disc ipl in a a hearing, which we were given com muni K service for. This year, as club captain, the\nfootball club's disciplinary record has been\nspotless so that every player has enjoyment without stepping over that line that\nis deemed irresponsible.\nWhat would you propose to do about\nthis big medic/non-medic split that's going\non at Imperial, that's so obvious to first\nyears?\nOK1 understand medical people have a six year course that takes up a lot of time and they are different in many ways to IC students. I said tonight that\nI'm would campaign for them to have\ntheir own sabbatical who would be able\nto address their issues to Union Coun-.\nc il which I think is very important.\niS han aka KatUWCIwalq\nI notice that you intend to get some discounts through your tenure. It has been\nmade clear that Dave Hellard is already\ndoing running an extensive campaign to\nInstitute this sort of scheme already. How\ndo you Intend to develop on this?\nThere are a lot of companies that Dave has\ngone for which in general do student discounts anyway. I 'll be trying to go for more\nlocal companies that are around the South\nKensington campus, and also the Charing\nOoss and St Mary's campus, which Dave has-n't handled so far.\nSo what was your incentive In running for a sabbatical position? Some people may\nassume ifs for CV points...\nThat's the thing. I'm not really going for CV\npoints here. As far as I'm concerned, If I take\nthe year out it's a heavy commitment to the\nUnion. If I want to go and get a job I should\nhope I could get a good job from my academic record, and earn a good salary. Ifs not\nthat I'm doing this for CV points - because I think that my CV is already quite good.\nReferring back,to your manifesto, you want\nto persist with hybrid entry. How do you\nIntend to reopen the Issue and be success-ful?\nfirstly I would like to point out that a lot of\nmedics that are now a part of our college\napplied to different colleges, they app lk xj it)\nSt Marys school of medicine and Charing\nCross medical school. I think it is grossly\nunfair that you should expect them, just\nbecause there was a merger, to be considered IC students - a lot of them dont consider them so kes to be IC stuck ;nts. I hey consider them sek es to be of their respected col\nleg es. I really do think that you should not\ncreate bad feeling for those people Iam for\nintegration - in the long run, there is a merger\nprocess that's taking place, and in the: long\nrun I do want single entry, so I think Imperial College teams should be the best teams\nwe can put out. At Ihis critical moment we are in the middle of a merger -1 want to\nmake it as painless as possible for the medical students because: I do not want to create bad feeling among Ih cm But how do you Intend to go up against\nBUSA when the Issue's already dosed?\n\\o thing Is set in stone. Nothing nothing ever\nis - it's all politics. It's how you deal with the\nIssue. If there arc enough medics that say\nwe want dual entry, it'll push them in that\ndirection. Obviously BUSA has an agenda -they want single entry at a certain date. I think\nwe should try and resist that as much as possible lo make sure that the medical schools\ntake this merger as long as possible, so that\nthe people in higher years don't have bad\nfeelings.\nYou said in your manifesto that you have had\nprevious experience in Union dubs and\npositions. What are these and why do you\nthink they have prepared you for being President?\nI 've been a part of the Union finance Committee, I was heavily Involved in STOIC last\nyear, and I was quite crucial in establishing\nits sui viva l. Ben Polounovsky,\nWe'd like to know two quantifiable policies\nthat you would Introduce If you were voted\nIn next year.\nWell, I'd like, for a start, to make the Union a more quantifiable place. I would like to\nmake a change in the Union on friday nights\nbecause they seem to be very much reserved to be the same kinds of music, orientated to the same type of people. So I was\nhoping that shows like the bomb could be\nput on a Friday night or allocated a longer\ntime. I think the election campaign system\nis too bureaucratic, with too many rules. It's not surprising that so few students vote\nwhen there is only two weeks of campaigning and the size of the posters are so\nlimited.\nDo you feel that the Union Is cosmopolitan,\nthat there Is enough Integration In the Unjg|l| If not how sould you draw on your background to Indude people from all cultures at\nImperial college In student life?\nI think it's definitely not mixed enough.\nBecause half the population of Imperial college is from overseas I think we should integrate their cultures to make a frei ndler place\nfor al! people. To make the college more cos-mo polit an,I think we should celebrate other\ncultural events in the Union, for example Chinese new year and Eeid, as well as the traditional christian events such as Christmas and\nEaster.\nBoth for home and international students,\nhow would you ease the burden of iM ng In\nLondon?\nI'i 'Iops II itn i duc ing cheaper ph ono calls tc >\nloi i ion companies; arranging with travel\nn) in ii \u2022 (Ii|i tickets. We do have qui lei heap tic ki I\\i lh SIA travel, although they\nml always Ihe most student Ireiondlv\nbodies (hey tend to be a bit bitchy from time\nto time. I 've had trouble with them myself.\nPeople who don't live in London should definitely get cheaper train tickets, I have: a friend\nwho can't go home more than every Two\nweeks because it is so expensive.\nWhat roles do you see as the roles the Constituent College Unions (CCU) play while\nyou're in the Union office?\nIt's for communication with the students\nthemselves. I would like the Unions to have\nmore control cover the departments and be\nable to influence the contents of the courses\nand how they are conveyed to the students.\nThe CCU would be the main channel of communication which would gather everything\nthat is wrong ei th the courses and pass the\ninformation on the; the Union, so we would\nactually be able to act on the issues raised.\nWhat do you think Is your key to success?\nI'm very different from the other can-di dates. I believe more in acting, that\nthe man does the job, not his knowle d ge.. "

    "content": "16 Elections 99/00 - Interviews 22 February 1999\nDP (Mutation & Welfare)\n# Kevin Butcher\nWhat do you see as your role in this new\npost within the Union?\nI think the role is fairly undefined at\nthe moment, and the biggest part of the\njob would involve taking a lot of work off\nthe president, which is really good because\nit means they'll be able to be more of a figurehead. I think the main points arc\nbeing involved with the welfare commit-tee, accommodation, academic affairs,\nstudent development those kind of\nthings that would be covered by the education and welfare remit. But as I say in my\nmanifesto it's going to take me the summer to pull a job description together.\nCollege Is quite a difficult Institution to\nmove In and to change. How do you Intend to make a stand for the students\nwhen it comes to a situation of conflict?\nI think being a postgraduate has really\nhelped out - I'm involved with lots of\ncommittees in the department, most\nnotably the health and safety committee\nin the Biochemistry Department, as a postgraduate representative. Recently I was\nseconded to the International Studenls\nCommittee, and they do listen to what students have to say. Ihey're always not trying to be too forceful - the v may seem like\na slow moving organisation with regards\nto students, but they do listen. It's being\nforceful and nice and putting a point\nacross\nWhat would you do about the current\nappointment delay and the clinic closures\non Tuesday afternoons?\nI think the Health Centre and the way\nthey're running it at the moment is probably OK considering the staffing levels, but\n11 think in terms of service and quality it's not very good at all. It should be open during office hours plus a few more either\nside. I think being closed on alu es day afternoon is really poor.\nYou're taking a certain workload away\nfrom the president - what areas are currently lacking that you will address?\nI think certainly this year, and I don't want to do down anyone who has been\ninvolved this year, is the fact that they are\nnon-sabbatical positions and are doing it\nin their spare time. I think something that's been lacking this year is awareness of\nevents and I think this is a big thing to\nfocus on next year.\nHow will you get out information to the\nstudents, and what else we are going to\ngain from you as our officer?\nI think the biggest way is getting out\nthere. Certainly today when I was in the JCR\nI got a lot of people talking to me about\nthe position. I think the education and welfare stuff on the web is old, to a certain\ndegree - it's not bad, but it certainly needs\nupdating.\nFelix Editor\nDavid Roberts\nHow do you feel that your previous\nroles within Felix have helped you prepare for this editorship?\nI think it gives me some all round knowledge of what Felix is about. The film editor makes me get involved with\nall the other students who come in\nwho want to contribute and makes me get used to the editing process.\nDoing a lot of news writing, I get to know all the people around the Union and around College, so I get to know just who' s important and where togo for information. And being Advertising\nManager gives me a fairly solid grasp\nof the finances of Felix and where all\nthe money comes from which, although it's not something that students real lv care about very much, is a very important part of the job. So what do you think your methods are\nfor attracting writers, editors and read-ers?\nIhe first thing is just to make it\nseem fun I mean, one of the big things we get is an awful lot of review\nwriters, because it's lun, you get a lot\nof freebies out of it - you got a lot of free music and free films, and that\nkind of thing. News writers, from that\npoint of view, and Feature writers - it's just a case of seeing your name in\nprint, it's fun There's quite a rush in\nseeing your name in print on Monday morning. After a few weeks things change, you real lv get the sense that\nyou' ve made a difference, which is a wonderful thing about the job. and one of the things Ire all v like - just the chance to really feel you make ad if ference.\nA central part of [reporting] news\naround Imperial College and student\nissues Is the objectivity - looking at it\nfrom both sides. How do you intend to\nprotect that and the editorial stance of\nFelix?\nI think Felix is always very independent I don't think we take too much ola line - certainly not a college\nline. I think most of the: time we manage to avoid a Union line - one of the big problems is, I think, the case of\nbias; I know I'm not great on this issue,\nand it's a case of trying to keep it\nobjective and trying to avoid dishing\nthe dirt in an unfair way. It's really just\na case of presenting all the in form a tion, just putting down all the facts,\ngetting all the quotes.\nDo you intend to make a millennium\nfifty years production as your last question - how are you going to make the\nImpact?\nWe're getting together all the old\neditors - they're meeting up for mayday this year, getting together, and\nhopefully we'll have information coming from all fifty years.\nStuart Cook is also allegedly standing for ICU President, but didn't turn up at hustings or to be interviewed.

OK?\nJackie Brown\nJackie Brown, on the other hand, is a perfect example of the kind of movie that any\nHollywood exec would kill for. Tarantino's return, after a three year hiatus, waltzed\nits way into the box office big league,\ndespite a minuscule budget (all the stars\nworked for peanuts, just to have the chance of working with him). Moreover,\nby choosing man-of-the-moment Elmore\nLeonard (Get Shorty, Out of Sight) for his\nsource material, he made a safe bet doubly sure. Samuel I. Jackson, Robert De\nNiro, Bridget Fonda, Pam Grier and Michael Kcaton all step effortlessly into\ncarefully crafted roles, and deliver some classic Tarantino dialogue: \"AK-47. When you absolutely, positively got to kill every\nmotherfucker in the room. Accept no substitutes.\" Need I say more?\nFace\nSomehow, Robert Carlyle isn'ta mega star yet. I don't understand why though - he's starred in two of the biggest British movies\nof the nineties (Trainspotting, The Full\nMonly), alongside an amazing range of\nTV performances. Thus, in Face he once\nagain pulls out a top notch performance\nin an under-written role, leading a group\nof Londoners in a bungled heist. The plot\nmay be formulaic, but the performances\nare far from predictable. Underrated and\noverlooked first time around, it's time for\nlace's second chance. Q Dave\n\n"

Described as \"fearless and passionate\", Nejla Kanteper was one of a group of angry Kurds protesting outside\nthe Embassy in fury at the arrest of rebel\nleader Abdullah Ocalan in Nairobi, Kenya.\nThe well-orchestrated protests took place in many major European capitals,\nincluding The Hague , Bonn and Vienna, as well as in Vancouver and Sydney. Kurdish protesters stormed embassies and consulates early in the morning and barricaded themselves inside. They seized hostages inside these buildings - including the wife and eight-year-old son of the Greek Ambassador in Holland. In Lond on,50 Kurds continued to hold the Greek Embassy in Holland Park as Felix\nwent to press.\nOcalan, leader of the PKK Kurdistan\nWorkers Party, was arrested in Nairobi on his way to the airport to catch a flight to\nthe Netherlands from the residence of the Greek Ambassador there. The capture was announced by Bulent Ecevit, the\nTurkish Prime Minister, saying he would \"account for his actions\" in front of the Turkish judiciary. Ocalan is expected to be\ncharged with attempting to set up a separatist state for Kurds; the charge carries\nthe death penalty. Nobody has been By Sunil Rao\nPhoto: Ed Round the clock protest brings traffic to a standstill\nexecute d in Turkey for fifteen years, but\nthe authorities face being labelled weak if they do not hang him and the risk of making Ocalan a martyr if they do. In a statement, the PKK accused Turkey, Israel and the United States of conniving to capture Ocala n through a \"secret service action\". The Foreign Office\nrefused to comment, while the White\nHouse admitted that it was \"very pleased\"\nat the arrest, while denying any direct\ninvolvement. (The US sees the PKK as ades tabi lising influence on the Kurdish\ncommunity it protects in Northern Iraq,\nand has labelled it a terrorist organ is a tion.) Many Kurdish prisoners in prison\nare on hunger strikes, and at least one has burnt himself to death in protest.\nNejla Kanteper is recovering in hospital.\nGreece has come under fire after\nsecretly sheltering Ocalan for two weeks in Nairobi. The Turkish newspapers Hurriyet and Milliyet report that a Turkish\ncommando team, dispatched to Nairobi\nfollowing intelligence reports, stopped\nOcalan's car on the night of Monday the 15th and handcuffed him to a seat\nin the plane of a Turkish businessman they had forced him into. Greek officials, meanwhile, claim that Ocalan had left the embassy against their advice in\nthe face of allegations that they had paved the way for Ocalan's arrest in the\ninterest of maintaining smooth relations\nwith Turkey. The treatment Turkey hands\nout lo its prisoner will now come under\nintense scrutiny as the need to retain stability in the region and prevent full-scale\nwar from breaking out remains param o unt the credibility of the government abroad will depend heavily on their\nensuring that the trial is fair.\nThe Foreign Office has warned holi day makers bound for Turkey, urging them to remain vigilant. The many Kurdish supporters of the PKK in Britain are\nofficially regarded as legitimate dissidents and arc allowed to stay so long as\nthey do not pose a threat to Britain's security and are not involved in plotting\nacts of terrorism abroad.

    "content": "8 22 February 1999\nRight Angles To Reality\nBuses\nT ime and tide waits for no man. Neither, it seems, does a number14 Routemaster going down Putney\nHigh Street. If I was of a more suspicious\nbent, I'd almost say that the driver was ignoring me on purpose. As a rule, how-ever, I don't go in for conspiracy theories\n-1 think that they're just a big con conjured up by the establishment, paid for by\nbig business and circulated by the media to distract our attention from the real\nissues. But in the case of this bus, I'm prepared to make an\nexception. The really\nfrustrating thing was that I had been oh so tant ali singly close\nto that oft-dreamt-of\n(but seldom realised)\nsituation of strolling\nserenely up to the bus stop just as your\nbus pulls up with a delicate fart of the air brakes. It hap-pen ed to me once in Norwich in 1986\nand was the only bright spot of a thoroughly dismal holiday when, thanks to an\ntruly gargantuan cock-up when booking the trip, myself and three friends spent a fortnight hitch-hiking around what seemed like every little narrow country\nlane in East Anglia. We were convinced that we had booked a sailing holiday\nand it was only when we got back to civilisation and went to the travel agent to ask\nfor our money back that it turned out that\nwe'd actually signed up for two weeks on the Norfolk B roads. But as I said, at\nleast I'd managed to board a City Hopper in what passes for Norwich town centre,\nso that was something. On this particular day, however, I was not to be so lucky. I was walking briskly down the Upper Richmond Road\ntowards the crossroads with Putney High\nStreet and had nearly reached the traffic\nlight when the aforementioned double decker glided smugly across the intersection and drew up, overshooting by\nonly a couple of dozen feet. Suddenly\nmy quiet little world was shattered and I was propelled headlong into the Silvikrin\nBus Chase Challenge. Let me explain. Silvikrin, for the uninitiated, is the name of a brand of hairspray popular amongst female secretaries and librarians in the1970 s, the television advertising campaign for which featured a voice-over\nwhich posed the question \"is she or isn't she ?\", the point being to emphasise that the aforementioned hairspray was so\ncomfortable and natural-looking that the only person who knew for certain\nwhether or not she was wearing it was the wearer herself. Whilst the ad in ques-Matt Salter\n'...suddenly my quiet\nworld was shattered\nand I was propelled\nheadlong into the\nSilvikrin Bus Chase\nChallenge...\"\ntion is dead and gone and Silvikrin is now no longer\nconsidered to be a frontline hair care product, the idea at the\nheart of the campaign that sold it lives on and now finds employment in the nudge-nudge, wink-wink world of sanitary towel\nadvertising, and the closely related area\nof the Silvikrin Bus Chase Challenge. This\nlatter phenomenon rears its ugly head in\njust the circumstances in which I found\nmyself at the beginning of this paragraph\n- being almost, but\nnot quite, on time for my bus.\nWhereas in the advert of the same name the central\ndilemma was one of\n\"is she or Isn't she\",\nin the Silvikrin Bus\nChase Challenge, the question is\n\"should I or should-n'tI?\". Anybody who has lived in London for even the shortest\nlength of time is sure to have been through this Hamlet-esque experience -you got through to if you dialled 100 in south-west\nScotland), but in the splits e cond allowed to meI weighed up all\nthe relevant factors and decided to take\nup the Challenge. Throwing caution to\nthe wind I set off with the pace (although\nnot the politics) of a young Seb Coe, with my heart in my mouth and Vangelis ringing in my ears.\nI made it down to the crossroad in a time which would have got me into the medals for the 200m in the1924 Paris\nOlympics and rounded the corner\ninto Putney High Street, narrowly missing an octogenarian\npiloting a Zimmerf ram e.A quick sweep of the head\nright-left revealed\nthat the nearest\noncoming vehicle\non the road was a Citroen Xantia about\n30 yards away and travelling at ooh... I don't know....quick ish.... might be ok if\n...as I saw the Number\n14 flash across the\nintersection in front of\nme, I felt something a primeval urge welling\nup within me...\"\nto chase or not to chase? In such situ a I yeah, that's do-able. Without break-\"...I was exiled on my\ntraffic island, watch inc my bus receding into\nthe distance...\"\nt ions people who in their daily lives have\nabout as much use for complex vector\nmathematics as an England test batsman\nhas for sunblock, suddenly click into\nRob o cop mode. In an instant they have\nnoted the current positions of the bus\nand themselves and have started making\nrapid and highly detailed assessments\nof relative distances, relative speeds, the\nstate of traffic congestion further up the street, the num ber of mums with\npushchair s/ OAPs in\nbattery powered wheelchairs/bus kers playing \" Here Comes the Sun\"( except for the tricky guitar riff in the\nmiddle which they hum instead)/ \"Big\nIssue\" vendors or other obstacles on the\npavement as well as the likelihood of the\nnext set of traffic lights but one turning\nred at an advantageous moment, in an\neffort to decided whether or not to make\na run for the bus.\nBut now, as Is aw the Number14 flash across the intersection in front of me,I felt a primeval urge welling up\nwithin me( either that or I'd eaten my Golden Grahams too quickly) and I knew that my time had come. Maths has never\nbeen my strong suit (I flunked the \"Intro-duct ion to Quantum Mechanics\" course\nunit in my first degree due to my labour-ing under the misapprehension that a Hamiltonian Operator was the person\ning stride I half-vaulted, half-slid over the bonnet of a parked ford Capri M kl in a fashion that would have had Bodic and Doyle nodding with approval, and made a dash for the central reservation. I was half-way there and this real life version of\nFrogger was almost over. I looked up and noticed to my horror that the trolley-wielding pensioner who was at that very\nmoment struggling\npainfully on to the\nplatform at the back\nof the bus, to the detached amuse ment of the Blakeylookalike conductor,\nwas the last person\nin the queue. Panicstricken Is napped my head round to my left, up the hill to see if there was anything coming before I made the final\nsprint for the tape. Argh! The five red\nlights had just gone out and the entire\nMonaco GP starting grid was diving into\nVirage St Devote. Damn, damn, damn. Swinging back to my right, Is aw that\nThora Hird had at last boarded the bus\nand that the conductor had his hand on the communication' cord. Arr rg gg hh! Blakey gave a last glance around to pick\nup any stragglers, gobbed copiously onto\nthe pavement and then with a practised\nflick of the wrist double-dinged the bell\nto signal to his colleague that it was time\nto put down The Sun with Lovely Lucy\nfrom Leicester and get the show on the road. Noo ooo! As the double-decker\nbefore me slid smoothly off down the hill\nlike the QE2 at its inaugural launch, the\nfront row of the grid bore down on me in a cloud of 4-star fumes with rows 2 and3 hot on their heels, and I was exiled on my traffic island, watching my bus receding into the distance. All that I could do now was hope and pray for a break in the\noncoming flood of vehicles..and\n...yes...yes sss... there it was. Between the\nwhite Golf and the blue Hyundai behind\nit. Maybe a couple of meters, maybe\nmore. It would be\nenough! As they\ndrew level with me,I broke into a trot and then when the time\nwas right cut sharply\nacross the flow of\ntraffic and over to\nthe opposite pave-ment, provoking a furious bout of horn-honking and fist waving from the\nHyundai driver. I swore at him in Korean\nand belted off down the road after my\nbus, throwing women and children\nbehind me and screaming at the top of\nmy lungs \"wait for me\" as I ran. And oh yes, oh yes s s! The next set of lights but\none were turning red! My bus would have to stop! Thank You God! It was\ngoing to be all right, I was going to make\nit. Eric Liddlc eat your heart out. I redoubled my efforts and sprinted down the\nHigh Street, weaving from side to side,\nsometimes on the pavement, sometimes\nin the gutter, like a Cruise missile seeking\nout the most efficient route to downtown Baghdad. And all at once, my\nquarry was before me, mere feet away.\nAutomatically I thrust out a hand, grabbed\nthe white pole and hung on tight. As the\nbus was travelling slightly faster than I, the\nextra forward momentum pulled me off\nmy feet and I landed on the foot plate, sweating profusely and panting like Darth\nVader coming ashore at Cap Gris Nez after a cross-channel swim. Using what\nlittle strength I had, I dragged myself\nupright with the help of a handrail and collapsed into the nearest available seat,\nwhereupon my fellow passengers broke\nspontaneously into a round of applause.\nAlthough weak with exhaustion I acknowledged their congratulations with\na feeble wave of the hand and then\nreturned to the important task of gulping\ndown suitcase-sized lumps of air. My exertions seemed to have impressed\neven Blakey who gave me a beatific smile\nwhich changed into a vindictive leer as he\nturned to the rest of the passengers and called out \"Putney Bridge next stop ! This\nbus terminates here! All change please!\"\n\n"

In total there are nineteen tracks spread\nover the two CDs and contributions come from the likes of Massive Attack,\nFatboy Slim, Underworld and Banco De Gaia. Kicking off with the first CD, you are\npresented with a variety of sounds ranging from ambient trance with Banco De Gaia's 'Drunk As A Monk' to big beat\nmadness in BRA'S' Why Is A Frog loo'. It\nwould be easy but tedious to list all the\nartists on here and that would probably\nbe enough to convince you to buy the album. Instead I 'll just mention some of the best and worst tracks\nMassive Attack's 'Protection' is an apt\nstart to the album providing and atmospheric and moody feel that pervades\nthroughout the entire record. Trancey\nsounds are popular, the music choice of\n'eco warriors', with artists such as Astralasia and Electric Skychurch. There are a couple of weak tracks including 'The\nBug' by Face On Mars and U2's' Mofo', but despite some random fillers the album holds it own overall.

Ihus the music on this compilation, Music U/7/7 No Name, which is\nmore average than a red Astra, is not\nappreciated.\nIhe style of the album is sort of world music, often with lyrics in unrecognizable foreign languages, and beats\nthat lead it down an easy listening drum and bass path.

Then motorbikes and mopeds. Then the underground, which\nties with taxis during many periods of the\nday. Then we have buses and cars, and even these can sometimes be beaten by\nfoot. All that's without the investment in\ncycle lanes and paths, underground trains\nand stations, and bus lanes, that a toll or\ntax funded scheme could provide.\nMay beI'm a dreamer, an idealist,\nwhatever. Maybe the carbon monoxide fumes and low frequency high decibel\nnoise that lines the Cromwell Road every\nmorning when I walk into college from\nEarls Court has got the better of me. May beI'm unrealistic to hope for a city\nIn which lorries don't hurtle past my bed-room window every ten minutes all night\nlong, causing the double glazing to r ever berate. May beI'm just too cynical.\nWe can make a difference. For the\nsake of my sanity, campaign against red\nroutes (those red lines on roads lo increase traffic flow) and for better public transport. We have a voice, and we have a vote.
