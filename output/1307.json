    "content": "FILM film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nWars go away, paranoia remains\nSeveral strong performances that are worthy of Oscars, but ultimately let down by an\nimplausible plot\nThe Manchurian Candidate is a\nremake starring Denzel Washington\nas an ex-army major who is pushed\nto the limits of sanity to bring a\nhigh level government conspiracy\nto justice.\nDuring the Gulf war in the early\nnineties, Major Ben Marco\u2019s\nunit came under attack. Marco\n(Washington) was knocked uncon-scious, but Sergeant Raymond Shaw\n(Liev Schreiber) manages to sin-gle-handedly kill all the ambushers.\nYears later Shaw, now a war hero,\nis running for the vice-presidential\nnomination and uses his apparently\nheroic actions as political capital.\nBut things are not quite right: Major\nBen Marco\u2019s growing uneasiness\nabout what actually happened in\nIraq leads him to uncover a web\nof deceit involving a major multinational corporation, brainwashing,\nand (and this is my favourite line in\nthe film) \u201crich people funding bad\nscience to put a sleeper in the White\nHouse\u201d.\nIt\u2019s a testament to Denzel\nWashington\u2019s acting ability that they\ndecided to name the capital of the\nUnited States and a state on the\neast coast after him. As he has done\nin films such as Malcolm X and\nTraining Day, Washington tears up\nthe screen with another effortlessly\nconvincing performance. However,\nthe best acting comes from Liev\nSchreiber, who tears up the screen,\nputs it in a shredder and uses the\npieces to make a papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9\nOscar, which I daresay is sitting on\nhis mantelpiece right now.\nThis is a deeply political film.\nPerhaps not overtly political like\nFahrenheit 911, it uses the medium\nof fictional representation to address\nvery similar issues. In many ways,\nThe Manchurian Candidate is a\nfar stronger critique of American\ndemocracy than Fahrenheit 911 was.\nWhat appears on the surface to be a\nsmoothly run democracy disguises\nlayers and layers of corruption and\npropaganda. In The Manchurian\nCandidate, appearances are always\ndeceptive and with minute-by-minute twists there is very little you\ncan take for granted.\nAt the same time, what lets the\nfilm down is the plot. It\u2019s not so much\nMichael Moore as Mickey Mouse.\nEven your most ardent conspiracy\ntheorist would pass this one off as\n\u2018a bit over the top\u2019. Although realism has never been a core value for\nHollywood, a degree of \u2018suspension\nof disbelief\u2019 is required so that the\naudience can stay on the ride. It all\nseems so unnecessarily elaborate \u2013\nfor example, why does Manchurian\nGlobal go to all this trouble with\nbrainwashing and microchip brain\nimplants when it could just bribe\neveryone with money or position. By\napplying Occam\u2019s Razor to this film,\nyou\u2019ll quickly realise that it has a big\ngaping hole right in the middle of it.\nIn this day and age, it is good to\ncome across a film that has a political message. It took Hollywood several years after the Vietnam debacle\nbefore it started making anti-war\nmovies like Full Metal Jacket and\nApocalypse Now. Hopefully in the\nnext few years we will see more\nfilms that scrutinise the American\npolitical system and try to address\nthe madness going on in Iraq.\nAt this stage, however, many of us\nare sick of hearing about the likes of\nGeorge Bush, Halliburton, and the\nWar on Terror \u2013 for people who have\nhad enough of these issues, this is\nnot a film for you. However, if you\nlike your conspiracy theories fast,\nfurious and downright implausible\nthen The Manchurian Candidate is\nthe film to see this weekend.\nDarius Nikbin The most oedipal movie around at the moment\nThe Manchurian Candidate\nDirector: Jonathan Demme\nStarring: Denzel Washington, Meryl\nStreep, Liev Schreiber\nLength: 130 minutes\nCertificate: 15\nHHHII\nBeing Julia could win Bening Oscars\nTo begin with, I went to a Friday\nlate night show of Being Julia with\na couple of my friends. We were\nthe only ones in the theatre! As you\nwould imagine, this was not at all\nencouraging. However, I did watch\nthe movie without switching off my\nmobile phone! Add this to the first\nthirty minutes of a boring start of\nthe movie during which the main\ncharacters were introduced, and\nyou would have to try hard not to\nfall asleep. However, this boredom\nwas soon washed away.\nThe movie is based around the\nfunny novella written by W Somerset\nMaugham. Being Julia is about\na theatre actress, Julia Lambert\n(Annette Bening), going through a\nmid-life crisis. She is married to\na great director Michael Gaslin\n(Jeremy Irons), has a teenage son\nRogerGosselyn(ThomasSturridge),\nand has a talent that captivates her\naudience. She has a great and popular career, is in her fifties and can\npass as a twenty-something actress.\nSo what is going wrong?\nThough it looks like she has it\nall, she is completely exhausted by\nbeing the only one in the whole play\ngiving it her all. She just wants a holiday and is also very fearful of her\ngrowing age. She is bored and looking for something to spice up her\nlife. Her life and acting performances are inspired and turned around\nwhen she is seduced and starts an\naffair with the much younger gold\ndigging Tom Fennell (Shaun Evans).\nUnaware of Tom\u2019s trick, Julia pays\nfor his bills and gives him expensive\npresents. I was all perked up when\nI heard Tom\u2019s birthday was on 20\nNovember, which was the same day\nI saw the movie and also my birth-day! How coincidental can one get?\nThroughout the whole film, Julia\u2019s\ndead mentor Jimmy Langton\n(Michael Gambon) is very much\nalive (more like a ghost) to her,\nreminding her of how everything\noutside the theatre is just a fantasy\nand isn\u2019t real. It doesn\u2019t help either\nwhen her son Roger tells her that\n\u201cyou have a performance for every-one. I don\u2019t think you exist. Even the\nthings you say are second hand\u201d.\nIt is a very touching moment and\nyou can almost see Julia\u2019s fa\u00e7ade\nclear away for a moment to reveal\nthe person within, but only for a\nmicrosecond.\nJulia\u2019s husband, who believes in\nbeing a \u201cmodern couple\u201d, is aware of\nher unfaithfulness but is completely\nOK with it as long as it doesn\u2019t affect\nher stage performance. He is too\nbusy counting the cash. Anyhow,\nJulia sees the light when Tom turns\nhis attention to a girl of his age, the\nbeautiful-perfect-figured air-head-ed actress Avice Crichton (Lucy\nPunch). Avice tries to be a genius,\nacting as Julia. She goes on to take a\nrole in Julia\u2019s next play and also has\nan affair with Tom. This is exactly\nwhere the whole movie takes a twist\nand a new side of Julia comes into\nplay.\nThe personal and tactful revenge,\ncomedy and excitement of how Julia\nuses her gift to basically stand up\nand manipulate everyone who had\nscrewed her keeps you interested\nfor the remaining part of the movie.\nShe might be glamorous, stunning\nand ladylike, but no one can fool\nher! She won\u2019t just take it when\nan upcoming younger actress takes\nher part without putting up a fight.\nShe does this in a very intricately\nplanned act consisting of making\neveryone else soar and then pulling the rug from right underneath\nthem, just as they are touching the\nstars. You almost empathise with\nthe other characters and yet you are\nrooting for Julia all the way. After all,\nthis is what acting is all about. All is\nfair in war and the theatre.\nThe wonderful knockout acting of\nBening is even considered by some\nto be worthy of an Oscar nomina-tion. The movie basically shows how\nan actress copes with her theatre\nrole and her normal daily life, which\nis kind of hard to distinguish. You\nreally can\u2019t tell the difference when\nshe is Being Julia or whether she\nis just using her acting skills. Her\ncharacter really gets through to the\nviewer from her elegant and polite\npersonality to a totally inhuman\nquality.\nThe director, Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3, visu-alises the 1930s well. He develops\neach role in the movie. The only role\nthat didn\u2019t shine as much would be\nthe young lover Tom. His character\nis badly cast and there is the whole\ndanger of his presence threatening\nthe scenes with Julia. There just\nwasn\u2019t any spark between Tom and\nJulia, possibly because most of the\ntime you are thinking, \u201cyuck\u201d.\nHowever, the director brings a\nwarm and welcome palette of colourful cinematography and style. It\nis beautifully set and it is believable\nthat it did in fact happen. There are\nno special effects that jump out at\nyou and the whole scene of the movie\nis made to look very much inkeeping\nwith the time. The cars, costumes\ndesign, restaurants scenes, dance\nsequences and the whole production\nof the movie are very realistic. Even\nthe way Julia\u2019s best friend tells her\nthat \u201che plays for the other side\u201d is\nso quaint. As for the script, it was\nperfect for Julia\u2019s mentor. The script\nhas richness, smart writing and a\ndensity of the language. There are\na lot of dialogue and a whole range\nof emotions.\nThough the movie has a slow pace,\nit is a masterpiece. One to go and\nwatch if you want to fancy yourself\na literary!\nVidula Vinayagamoorthy\nBeing Julia\nDirector:Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3\nStarring: Annette Bening, Jeremy\nIrons, Michael Gambon, Shaun Evans\nLength: 100 minutes\nCertificate: 12A\nHHHHI\nSuch a riveting performance that even she is on the edge of her seat\n\u201cWith minute-by-minute twists there\nis very little you can\ntake for granted\u201d\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 25 November 2004\n22\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 25 November 2004\n10\nLast Wednesday, in the England\nversus Spain \u2018friendly\u2019 match, we\nwitnessed hundreds of Spanish\nfans whooping and making monkey\nnoises towards the English black\nplayers.\nFirst of all, as President of the\nSpanish Society, I would like to\nextend a formal apology to those\nfootball fans and everyone else\nwho was offended by Wednesday\u2019s\n\u2018show\u2019. It was indeed a shameful\nspectacle that has fired up a strong\nresponse from the English press,\nwhich unfortunately has condemned\nthe whole of Spain as being a nation\nthat tolerates racism. Headlines\npublished in tabloid and broadsheet\nalike highlight this, including the\nThe Daily Mail\u2019s \u201cGive Spain some\npain\u2019 or The Times\u2019 \u201cThe toleration\nof the intolerable\u201d.\nA contributing factor to the scandal was a racist remark made by the\nunsuspecting Spanish coach, Luis\nAragon\u00e9s, whose comments about\nThierry Henry were caught on a\nmicrophone. The coach was promptly made to apologize, but no further\ndisciplinary action was taken. This\ndecision to keep a coach who has\nbeen recorded as making an unofficial racist statement is certainly\ncontroversial, as the coach is ultimately the face of the Spanish team.\nHe certainly does not represent the\ncountry\u2019s attitude, which has been\n\u201ccondemned categorically\u201d by a\nspokesman from the Spanish gov-ernment.\nIt must be said that Wednesday\u2019s\nevents are not common at football matches in Spain. The league\nincludes players from a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds who are\nexposed to the same amount of insult\nand praise as the Spanish white\nplayers. Last Wednesday has certainly not helped Madrid gain many\nsupporters for its 2012 Olympic\nGames bid, but should the action\nof some bigots be extrapolated to\nthe whole of the Spanish popula-tion? Are the Spanish racist, or does\nfootball bring the worst out of\npeople?\nSadly, discrimination has not been\nfully eradicated from any society.\nRacism and football have regrettably walked hand in hand before\nWednesday\u2019s game. Let us not for-get, for instance, that only 20 months\nago the English fans were recorded\nchanting \u201cI\u2019d rather be a Paki than\na Turk\u201d at the infamous England\nversus Turkey game in Sunderland.\nDiscrimination in football extends\nbeyond the issue of racism. On two\nindependent occasions, gay players\nhave been driven to suicide in both\nEngland and Italy, due to the abuse\nreceived from football fans.\nThese and other examples of the\nmore extreme consequences that\nresult from any form of abuse directed to social and ethnic minorities\nleads to the conclusion that such\nforms of discrimination must be\ndealt with. Proposed international\nactions as a result of this game range\nfrom the enforcement of a closed\ndoors game for the next international Spanish match to a complete ban\non Spanish football displays outside\nthe country. What actions are to take\nplace are unknown at the time of\nwriting, but whether such bans are\na solution to the problem is a matter\nof opinion.\nPointing the finger at a whole\nnation does not bode too promisingly as a way to deal with racism.\nInterestingly, The Times simply says\n\u201cyou just can\u2019t do that,\u201d referring to\nracial abuse against black players.\nSo are we to believe that the primary reason against being a racist\nbigot is that it is not politically cor-rect? To brand the whole of Spain as\nracist is not constructive, and will\nonly result in greater alienation and\ntension.\nRacism is a great problem that\nmust be dealt with on a larger\nscale, beyond football matches,\ninside classrooms and work places.\nNewspapers should condemn the\naction of the Spanish football fans,\nnot the whole of the country. That is\na form of discrimination in itself.\nCOMMENT felix@ic.ac.uk\nIs Spain a racist country?\nAfter racist abuse was suffered by England footballers against Spain last week, Nacho Quinones,\nPresident of the Imperial College Spanish Society, and Andrew Voak give their views\nSome may have noticed the emergence of a number of brave new\ntechnologies on the main campus\nin recent weeks and months, the\nsigns of a green feeling making itself\nmanifest quietly.\nNotable examples would include\nthe solar cells on Imperial College\nRoad, waterless urinals in the\nSherfield basement, and (more\ncryptically) a passive cooling system\non level five of the central library.\nAt present they may be token, but\nthese peculiarities are the forerunners for a movement that could benefit all of us; so not only do I think we\nshould get excited about them, but\nwe should actively ask for more.\nNow don\u2019t worry, although I\u2019m\nan environmentalist I\u2019m not going\nto get all ethical, just practical. By\ngenerating our own electricity on\ncampus (using solar cells) we are\nnot buying it in, which could feasibly pay for setup costs and maybe\neven give returns over generator\nlifetime. Equally, by cutting down on\nelectricity consumption in the first\nplace (waterless urinals, passive\ncooling), we will save thousands of\npounds per year. Surely a university\nso in need of money that it needs\nto charge its students hefty tuition\nfees would want to save as much as\npossible elsewhere? Think what the\nnewly freed thousands of pounds\ncould do for our Union!\nThen there\u2019s Imperial\u2019s public pro-jection. Most people walking past\nwill be impressed by the fact that we\ncan employ cutting edge and developing technologies, and are willing\nto venture forward in a way that\nmerges efficiency with ethics. Not\nonly do the government have grants\nfor the implementation of renewable energy technology, but I imagine that it is the kind of thing that\nwould attract more students. With\n\u00a3350m being spent on new buildings\nand refurbishments over the next\nfive years, and \u00a370m being spent on\nexisting buildings each year, there\nmust surely be scope for increasing\nthe amount of renewable technology\nused within the College?\nThe general environmental reasons for wanting to reduce \u2018fossil fuel\u2019 dependency, water use,\nunnecessary waste and energy\ninefficiency should really speak for\nthemselves: in the long term, it isn\u2019t\njust a question of ethical qualms\nabout damaging the world around\nus, but quite possibly one of societal and even human survival. This\nmay seem like a slightly extreme\noutlook, but may I point out the\nperhaps microcosmic examples of\nEaster Island and the Mayans, both\nsocieties that collapsed and died out\nthrough over-exploitation of their\nenvironment.\nRealistically, these are issues\nthat the College can easily address,\nbut doesn\u2019t on a large scale. New\nbuildings like the Tanaka Business\nSchool seem to have had absolutely\nno environmental impact assessment carried out on them prior to\nconstruction. Maybe this is the kind\nof thing we should be asking for, as\nstudents at, and technically customers of, the great Imperial machine.\nThe world is changing. The environmental movement has the potential to grow, as people and businesses around the globe realise the\ntrue nature of this most powerful,\nimportant and above all excellent\nof beasts. All I propose is that we\nencourage our university to swell\nthese green ranks; for the sake of\nits students, its economic interests,\nand the planet at large.\nImperial and the environment\nAs some new \u2018green\u2019 technologies begin to appear around campus, Joseph Bull argues that\nImperial College is not doing enough\nLetters to the Editor\nPalestinian posters\nDear Editor,\nPosters mourning the death of\nYasser Arafat, Palestinian Leader\nwere put up around college last\nMonday by the Palestinian Society.\nThe Posters were apolitical, and\ndid not have any textual comments\nrelated to the \u2018cause\u2019. These posters\nhave now been taken down.\nI believe that either individuals or\na group of people at Imperial have\ntaken objection to these posters. If\nthis is so, I think this is something\nthat should not pass unreported and\nshould be made aware to the readers of the Felix.\nThere seems to be some form of\npolitical vendetta against the very\npresence of Palestinians or those\nwho support their cause, at Imperial.\nI think that neither the college nor\nthe union has any such stand hence\nit is something that needs to be\ninvestigated and rooted out of our\ninstitution.\nI understand that the Palestinian\nSociety who made the posters tried\nto make it as apolitical as possible\nand conform to all the rules & regulations set by the union and college\non placing of posters in college.\nI strongly believe that this is an\nissue that needs to be covered by\nFelix. I understand the apolitical\nnature of the Imperial College Union\nitself, but it is also under obligation\nto represent the points of views or\nissues that affect its students.\nYours Sincerely\nZaki Nuseibeh\nElectrical Engineering II\nSend your letters to felix@ic.ac.uk.

So this week,\nyou\u2019re getting hunting, char-lies and football.\nNobody who picked up a\nnewspaper or turned on the\nTV this week could have failed\nto notice that hunting has\nfinally (almost) been banned.\nA nice game of bill ping-pong\nwas played between the two\nHouses of Parliament before\nthe Speaker of the Commons\nfinally invoked the Parliament\nAct and the Bill was passed.\nThe Parliament Act is\ninvoked rarely (usually for\nimportant constitutional\nchanges and the like) and\nwas put in place to assert the\npower of the Commons over\nthe Lords. Usually, a bill is\nread in the Commons, debated and then passed or reject-ed. If passed, it moves to the\nsecond chamber, the Lords,\nfor discussion. The Lords\nthen send the bill back to the\nCommons with changes to be\nmade and suggestions.\nThe Parliament Act overrides this process \u2013 despite\nthe Lords voting against banning hunting last week (but by\na surprisingly small majority),\nthe bill was still made law by\nthe Commons. And that was\nthat \u2013 700 years of hunting\nbanned. Or was it?\nThe furious hunt supporters\nvowed immediately to take\nthe fight to the high court. The\nTelegraph is a supporter of\ntheir cause and commented\nthat this was class war combined with another national\ntrait: \u201cthe class warriors\nwere victorious because they\nformed an irresistible alliance with those who labour\nunder the illusion that foxes\nare sweet\u201d. Most newspapers\npointed out the fact that the\nvast majority of people in the\ncountry really don\u2019t care one\nway or the other about this\nissue, finding it a diverting\nbut ultimately pointless way\nto spend time in Parliament.\nOne Guardian columnist\nwent so far as to say that he\n\u201ccouldn\u2019t bear to hear another\nword about it\u201d.\nPrince Charles also seems\nunable to keep himself out of\nthe papers \u2013 for all the wrong\nreasons \u2013 at the moment. He\nwas embroiled in another\nscandal this week when a\nleaked memo he had written\nto his staff appeared to suggest that people should know\ntheir place and not aspire to\nthings of which they are not\ncapable. Of course, as a man\nwho has earned every posi-tion, medal and penny that\nhe has, and has in no way\nbeen gifted it by Mummy, he\nhas every right to go spouting\noff like this. But did he actually say that? It appears that\nthis may have been (surprise\nsurprise) whipped up by the\ntabloids, who scented a second juicy class warfare story\nof the week.\nThe memo, it seems, actually says that young people\nshould not expect success to\nbe handed to them without\nhard work and a talent for\nwhat they are doing. The Sun\nand The Mirror treated it as\nan amusing spat between the\nGovernment and the Prince,\nwhereas The Daily Mail\nsaw it as a battle between\nthe Labour party (historically\nrepublican) and the monar-chy, after the education secretary Charles Clarke criticised\nthe Prince and called him old-fashioned.\nThe Guardian and many\nother papers saw nothing\nwrong with what the Prince\nsaid, although he obviously\nis not the person to say it:\nthey thought that \u201csome jobs\nare better than others; not\neveryone will get one of the\ngood ones. The overwhelming majority of people will not\nfind fulfilment through their\njobs. They will find it through\nactivities outside their jobs, or\nfriendships within their jobs,\nor they will not find it at all.\nExpecting otherwise is delusional.\u201d\nThedebateseemstobedying\ndown now as the Government\nare reputedly keen to forget\nthe whole business, but what\nhas come out of it is that the\nPrince really, really needs to\nkeep his mouth shut like the\nQueen can, and that he also\nreally, really needs a better\nPR team.\nFinally, the football. I love\nfootball, have had a season\nticket in England for six\nyears and did my final year\nin Barcelona (where some of\nyou may remember I wrote an\narticle about going to a football match and being shocked\nby the racist chanting). I am\ntoo depressed to write much.\nAll that occurs to me is yes,\nmy impression when I lived\nthere was certainly that the\nSpanish are racist, but real-ly, we are certainly not the\nnation who should be casting\nthe first stone and getting all\nself-righteous and moralistic\nabout it, as the racist abuse\naimed at Dwight Yorke on\nSaturday shows.\nFoxhunting, football and our future king\nEmily Gwyer on the week\u2019s biggest national news stories\nBy Dave Edwards\nEditor\nThe infamous \u2018speaker\nvan\u2019 has returned to South\nKensington, its passengers\npestering Imperial College\nstudents as they attempt to\noffload poor quality goods.\nThe van\u2019s driver and passengers call students over as\nif to ask for directions, claim\nthat they have had a delivery\nof speakers rejected and then\ntry to sell them at a \u2018knockdown price\u2019.\nIn the past, the speakers\nhave been found to be broken or of very low quality.\nAccording to Felix issue 1248,\nbuyers were asked to take the\nsalesmen to cash machines,\nand physical threats were\nmade against those who\nrefused to make a purchase.\nFelix has been made aware\nof two independent sightings\nof the van, attempting to sell\nthe speakers to Imperial students and graduates, in the\npast week.

    "content": "Less is Moore?\nYou\u2019ve all seen the film: now you can read the book. Marc Warner and Damien\nStephenson did just that, but perhaps wish they hadn\u2019t bothered\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 25 November 2004\n20\nBooks books.felix@ic.ac.uk\nThe Official Fahrenheit 9-11 Reader\ndeclares itself to be \u201cthe must-read\nbook of the must-see movie box office\nsmash\u201d. It\u2019s really not. If you\u2019ve seen\nthe movie you\u2019ve already covered\nthe two fifths of the book, dedicated\nsimply to the transcript of F9-11 the\nmovie in a far more digestible form.\nGiven that the book costs \u00a38.99 and\nMichael Moore has said on occasion\nthat he has no objection to anyone\ndownloading F9-11 the movie for\nfree, I suggest that at the very least\nyou skip this section.\nIt bothers me, though, that we\u2019re\nbeing charged at all for the book\nwhen Mikey \u2018man of the people\u2019\nMoore is so desperate to get his message across. Surely the internet is\nthe perfect medium to publish such\na work? But I guess when you\u2019ve\ngot repayments to make on a $1.2\nmillion apartment in Manhattan\u2019s\nplush East Side you can\u2019t afford to\nbe too generous.\nThe second part of the book sees\nMoore \u201cfire back at the critics with\nhis own \u2018Fact Bible\u2019 to prove that\nit\u2019s all true\u201d. Sadly it\u2019s beyond the\nscope of this article to meticulously\ncomb through this part of the book.\nI will, however, recommend the\nwebsite www.davekopel.com/Terror/\nFiftysix-Deceits-in-Fahrenheit-911.\nhtm for an in depth analysis of the\n\u2018fact bible\u2019.\nI will try to summarise it in more\ngeneral terms. To start with, the\n\u2018fact-checker\u2019 comprises 56 pages\nout of the 342 in the book, which is\ndisappointing given that it\u2019s the only\nnew content written by Moore. Even\nthe handful of responses that are\nincluded carefully dodge the issues\nin typical Moore style. He meticulously addresses non-points, issues\nwhich never even called his integrity\ninto question in the first place, whist\nignoring the parts of a particular\nissue where he has chosen to totally\nsubvert the truth.\nA typical example of this is the segment detailing the apparent vested\ninterest that George W Bush had in\nthe construction of an oil pipeline in\nAfghanistan. Moore\u2019s original assertion in F9-11 is that the visit of the\nTaliban to Texas while Bush was\ngovernor was to strike a deal to\nconstruct an oil pipeline in\nAfghanistan, and furthermore, that\nthe war in Afghanistan was fought\nsimply to secure that pipeline. As\nthe company that originally proposed the pipeline, Unocal, has links\nwith Vice President Dick Cheney,\nin Moore\u2019s eyes the conspiracy is\ncomplete.\nHowever, many critics point out\nthat the Taliban\u2019s visit to Texas\nhad absolutely nothing to do with\nBush and that documents show that\nUnocal had completely abandoned\nthe idea of building the pipeline in\n1998, long before the introduction of\nUS troops into Afghanistan.\nIn response Moore\u2019s \u2018fact-bible\u2019\nasserts that Unocal issued a press\nrelease, saying that \u201cHalliburton\nEnergy Services had been providing a variety of services in\nTurkmenistan for the last five years\n[1992-97]\u201d. Brilliant Mikey! The\nword \u2018Afghanistan\u2019 isn\u2019t even men-tioned, nor is any activity after 1997,\nsome four years before Bush allegedly invaded Afghanistan in order\nto secure the development of this\npipeline. This is supposed to convince us?\nMichael then wants us to know\nhow he\u2019s changed people\u2019s lives.\nThis involves 37 pages of emails\nto Moore that really can\u2019t be of\ninterest to anyone outside the production crew of F9-11 and Moore\u2019s\nimmediate family. I could forgive\none or two but I am genuinely at\na loss to explain what anyone is\ngoing to get out of 31 almost identical emails about how the sender\u2019s\ndad, who was previously chairman\nof the Republican party, signed\nup to buff John Kerry\u2019s numerous\nand undoubtedly well-deserved\nmedals after he\u2019d seen the film\nor some similar inconsequential\nrubbish.\nOf course the best thing about\nthis book is how laughable Michael\nMoore\u2019s vision of his own self-impor-tance is, now that the elections of\nTuesday 2 November have come and\ngone. This is particularly illustrated\nin the essays and cartoons at the\nend of the book. All portray Moore\u2019s\nnotion that he was somehow going\nto change the world with his film,\nan idea that seems especially quaint\nnow.\nThe American people that Moore\nso loves to insult and ridicule evidently aren\u2019t as stupid as he thinks,\nand cannot have their minds\nchanged on crucial issues just by\nwatching (or indeed reading) 122\nminutes of rantings by a tubby mid-westerner.\nSorry Mike, but the game\u2019s up, you\ndidn\u2019t change the world. But hey,\nmaybe none of this would have happened if you and thousands of your\nfollowers hadn\u2019t voted for Nader\ninstead of Gore in 2000... or was that\nreally all just a dream?\nThe Official Farenheit 9/11\nReader\nby Michael Moore\n(Simon & Schuster)\nHIIII\nTo promote the release of his new\nbook Big Bang, Imperial graduate and author of Fermat\u2019s Last\nTheorem Simon Singh stopped by to\ntalk to Felix Books.\nYour latest book, Big Bang, is\nquite a wide-ranging look at cosmology and physics in general. Do\nyou have a favourite area of this\nsubject?\nTo be honest, it was just a relief to\nget back to some physics! Fermat\u2019s\nLast Theorem was great fun to do,\nbut I appreciated the opportunity\nto write about something different\nin this book. I think it\u2019s important\nto write about some of the history\nbehind the pioneers of cosmology,\nand I like to talk about the people\ninvolved in such important ideas.\nYou studied physics at Imperial\nback in the mid-1980s. Do you\nhave any fond memories of your\ntime here?\nIparticularlyrememberBobJoseph,\nwho I believe is now the head of\nadmissions here. Whilst there isn\u2019t\none particular famous physicist or\nlecture here that inspired my interest in the subject, I\u2019m pleased to say\nthat I\u2019ve been encouraged by a succession of fantastic teachers. I\u2019ve\nalways thought that the teaching at\nImperial is excellent. The country\nneeds more good teachers though!\nDo you remember reading or writing for Felix?\nI remember Felix very well. It was\nedited by Pallab Ghosh when I was\nhere. I also used to edit the physics\nnewspaper, which was known as\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cat back then.\nWhat advice do you have for a\nbudding popular science writer?\nWriting is a lot easier to get into\nthan television. It\u2019s great that you\ndon\u2019t need any special equipment\nto start: just a pen and paper or a\ncomputer at home. I\u2019ve tried to build\na little humour into my lectures\nrecently, especially as not everyone\nis as willing to give science a chance\nas Imperial students are! I\u2019ve learnt\na lot about my style by giving lectures across the country and to a\nvariety of different audiences, each\nwith a different attitude to science.\nFinally, having written about cos-mology, do you think your career\nis going to continue expanding\nindefinitely or might it collapse\nback in on itself?\nWell, I\u2019m hoping for infinite expan-sion! However, I\u2019m enjoying reinventing myself every few years, a\nbit like Madonna I guess. Each time\nI move on to a different area, it\u2019s like\nresearching another mini-degree,\nwhich is a great way to work if\nyou\u2019re interested in lots of different things like me. This way I can\nexpand for a while and then move\non to another \u2018universe\u2019 and then\nexpand again.\nMultiple Madonna realities\u2026\nwhat an interesting image.\n\u25cf Simon Singh was talking\nto Martin Smith and Nicolas\nOsman\nBooks Interview: Simon Singh\nSimon Singh: just like Madonna?

That is to\nsay, they decide in an instant\nwhether the latest piece of\ninformation being thrown\ntheir way has any bearing\noutside the M25, and if not,\nimmediately ignore the post-er, turn the page or press the\ndelete button.\nI dare say some students\nwill be flicking through this\nvery newspaper and ignoring\nevery page but this one. So\nwhy am I using the one page\nthey will look at to waffle on\nabout just the sort of thing\nthey don\u2019t want to read?\nThose of you who read last\nweek\u2019s Felix will have heard\nabout the Imperial College\nUnion strategic review.\nEveryone else: wait!

What do you like\nabout the Union in Wye? What\ncould they do better? What\nareas do you think are under-resourced? Again, this is just\nas relevant to those who don\u2019t\nuse the Union, in order to\nsay why you don\u2019t use it: saying what would make it more\nsuited to your needs or tastes,\nor even letting us know here\nand now that the suggestions\nwould not help, is all useful.\nI realise that not everyone\nin Wye has this irrelevance\nreflex: some are keen at least\nto read about everything happening in London, even if they\ncan\u2019t get to all of it, and of\ncourse their views are important too; it\u2019s just that they are\nless likely to need telling. If\nyou are one of those students,\nthis is a valuable chance to\nsay which aspects of South\nKensington life you would\nlike to experience, and what\nif anything is stopping you,\nso efforts at campus communications and inter-campus\nevents are focused on the\nareas you want.\nYour Union wants to go in\nthe direction that you want,\nbut can only do this if you say\nwhat direction that is.\nSo please do look at the\nquestionnaire.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 25 November 2004\nMUSIC music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nSun, sand, and... music\nFelix reports back on the wonderfully relaxed Spanish festival experience\nthat is Festival Interna\u00e7ional de Benic\u00e0ssim\n17\nLIVE REVIEW\nThis reviewer starts in the ancient\nSpanish city of Girona, inland from\nthe Costa Dorada. The date is\nAugust 4, 2004. Primarily host to sun,\nbooze and sex seekers from around\nEurope with aims to satisfy all these\ndemands during the course of a two\nweek bender, I was able to add live\nmusic to my list, for I was starting\nmy second trip down the coast to\none of the greatest, and certainly\nthe most civilised music festival in\nEurope: Festival Interna\u00e7ional de\nBenic\u00e0ssim, known by the abbrevia-tion-mad Spanish as FIB.\nRadiohead, Bj\u00f6rk, the Cure, Blur\nand Moby are just a few of the\nessential live acts which have honoured FIB with their music over the\nten years of its existence. With this\nfine track record, the tenth anniversary of the festival was not to be\noverlooked. The decidedly mediterranean FIB organisers were several\nmonths later than their European\nrivals in updating their 2003 festival website to a 2004 website, and\neven more fashionably late with the\nconfirmed band line-up. This did\nnot deter me from booking a couple\nof 120 euro tickets for the five day\nweekend beach party.\nHeading down from Girona air-port, having spent around two quid\non budget flights, my girlfriend,\nher girlfriend and I followed the\nCosta Dorada and Costa Brava on\nour way to my favourite, the Costa\nBlanca. Relying on buses, trains\nand coaches, we eventually reached\nBenic\u00e0ssim via Tarragona and\nCastell\u00f3n de la Plana, both worth at\nleast a flying visit.\nBenic\u00e0ssim, 100km north of\nValencia, was once upon a time a\nholiday place for the higher ranks of\nSpanish society, offering them empty\nbeaches, clear sea views, and a spot\nof social climbing. Not so today. The\nsea front is a concrete nightmare,\nthe views are eclipsed for all but the\nnewest tower block, and there\u2019s not\neven a sniff of the smart Valenciano\nsocialites.\nThis is irrelevant, for Benic\u00e0ssim\nis the perfect canvas for such creativity that hits it during the festival\nperiod. From early August, the town\nwarms up with a fashion, a film\nand a fringe theatre festival, during\nwhich the FIB goers arrive to get\ngood value from their ten-day camping passes. For those festivalgoers\nfor whom domestic facilities have\nalways been an issue, rest assured\nthat there will be no problems in\nBenic\u00e0ssim. Over the years, three\npurpose-built camping zones have\nbeen created around the town, in\nsmall woody areas. Each site has\nyet more concrete blocks housing\npermanent toilets, showers, a bar\nand food stands. Most of the camping areas are shaded by the forest\u2019s\nthick canopy. This is of great relief,\nas I am convinced that in direct sun-light, the campers would die and the\ntents would melt.\nMusically, this year\u2019s line-up was\nslightly more obscure than in years\nbefore, and designed for the open-minded music lover. Had we not\narrived too late for Thursday night\u2019s\npre-party, we would have caught Ash\nopening the festival. Not to be, as we\nalso missed Felix da Housecat, an\nAmerican DJ better known on the\ncontinent than here in Britain. Most\ndays at Benic\u00e0ssim begin with rock\nbands from around 5pm, with headliners coming on close to midnight.\nThe bands give way to DJs who play\nwell into the morning. The last DJs\ncome on at 6am, but this is Spanish\ntime!\nFriday night started late evening\nwith Kings of Leon and Snow Patrol,\nfinishing up with headliners Air\nand the originators of electronica,\nKraftwerk. The German group\u2019s latest stage show features four guys\nin suits fiddling with their laptops.\nWhatever was going on in the\nKraftwerk machines was resulting\nin electronica with flawless attention to detail, timed and mixed to\nperfection. The digital graphics in\nthe screen show were in everyway\nas tasteful and experimental as\nthe original tracks such as 1975\u2019s\nAutobahn and 1983\u2019s Tour de France\nstill seemed today.\nOn Saturday evening the Scissor\nSisters did their stuff in one of\nthe tents. I am not a huge fan of\ntheir first record, but in Spain they\ncaught the festival crowd just at\nthe right time for a pickup, as they\ndid at Glasto, and set the ball rolling for a memorable evening spent\nwith the likes of Soulwax, Teenage\nFanclub, and a revitalised Primal\nScream. Lou Reed took the main\nslot on Saturday. With a low key\nfive piece band, including the inspirational cellist Jane Scarpantoni,\nReed had reworked and in several\ncases slowed down his old tracks,\nsuch as Walk On The Wild Side and\nthe Perfect Day. His set list was\nlaced with material from last year\u2019s\nalbum, Raven. All was carried off\nwith reliability and professionalism\nfrom an artist whose passionate and\npersonal song writing has enriched\ncreativity in the music industry for\nover 30 years.\nBritish retro rockers Franz\nFerdinand were one of the big\nnames of Sunday night, but more\ninspiring were the shows from old\ntimers Brian Wilson and Lambchop.\nLambchop ooze personality and built\nup an extraordinarily close relationship with the crowd, inducing a good\nhalf-hour encore. How refreshing it\nwas to see the band packing away\ntheir own gear at the end of the gig!\nChemical Brothers were headlining,\nand they did not disappoint, managing to squeeze every last drop of\nenthusiasm out of their crowd.\nSo, is it all about the music? Yes\nand no. On Monday night, 2 Many\nDJs and some noteworthy others\nplayed out the festival on Benic\u00e0ssim\nbeach. As you look around the party,\nthe international side of FIB is nothing but fascinating. This year, in\naddition to some extremely friendly\nse\u00f1orsandse\u00f1oritas,ImetGermans,\nItalians, plenty of French and loads\nof English. People who have been or\nplayed at FIB know how special it is.\nIt was once described by Huey of the\nFun Lovin\u2019 Criminals as \u2018the most\nchilled out festival in the world\u2019.\nIn publicising FIB, I am probably\nbreaking some term or condition, as\nit remains a secret for many people.\nHowever, it would be more of a crime\nif I were to lie low, as Benic\u00e0ssim\nproved this year, for the tenth time,\nthat it is an essential date in the\ndiary of world-class music events.\nDominic Passmore\nFestival Interna\u00e7ional\nde Benic\u00e0ssim\nBenic\u00e0ssim, Spain\nHHHHH\nFIB: the festival is between the sea and some glorious mountains\nAir: Gallic dreampop has the power to control the moon\nKings Of Leon: a wonderfully photogenic band, now with material written by the actual band members\nA summer\nsingle, in\nNovember?\nSINGLE REVIEWS\nIt\u2019s not that often that you come\nacross music that just makes you sit\nand giggle. When you do, though, it\u2019s\na terribly uplifting experience.\nThe Mad Staring Eyes are a foursome from North London who combine manically intelligent lyrics, laid-back guitars and bizarre humour\ninto deceptively simple rock that\nis, frankly, completely and utterly\nbonkers.\nWith spacey melodies harking\nback to David Bowie and occasional\nthumping bass lines and deliciously weird phrases reminiscent of\nNick Cave and the Bad Seeds, they\nembrace eclecticism with refreshing abandon, standing out from the\nbland morass of current fashionable\nrock bands with their sheer pecu-liarity. A hint of politics and a good\ndose of irreverence make it all up\ninto a fascinating and unpredictable\nexperience that is never quite what\nit seems.\nSometimes morose but always wry\nand ironic, amusing and enlightening but just a little grubby, The Mad\nStaring Eyes are a fun-loving bunch\nthat will take you on a thoroughly\nenjoyable ride and have you coming\nstraight back for more.\nAnna Novitzky\n\u25cf The Mad Staring Eyes will\nbe playing in dBs on 4 December, as part of a RockSoc gig\nnight.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 25 November 2004\nFILM film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nA tale of two Seans\nYou might need an epidural for this difficult delivery\n23\nA rip roaring action adventure with\nextravagant special effects and a\nkiller soundtrack is certainly not\nwhat you will get if you go to see\nBirth. Nor will you find a warm fuzzy\nlove story promising that, in the end,\nall you need is love. Instead, you will\nfind a dark brooding human drama\nthat shows how people are never\nquite what they seem.\nAn ordinary man dies and just\nafterwards, somewhere in the same\ncity, a baby is born. Ten years later,\na little boy goes to the still-grieving\nwidow, Anna (Nicole Kidman), and\ntells her that he is her dead hus-band. Anna was about to remarry\nthough, until young Sean showed up\npurporting to be her dead Sean and\ntelling her that he wants her back.\nShould she believe him, because he\nseems to know so much about her,\nor is he just a weird little kid with too\nmuch time on his hands?\nSet in New York, the director,\nJonathan Glazer, uses winter to\nsymbolise Anna\u2019s still lingering\nmourning as well as contrasting it\nwell with the warmth and comfort\nthat her family and new fianc\u00e9 want\nto provide her. Glazer also captures\nNew York high society and deftly uses a grand dame of cinema,\nLauren Bacall, to portray Anna\u2019s\nwise, if distant, mother. Bacall definitely makes her presence felt in\nevery scene she appears in.\nKidman, playing Anna, is almost\nbrilliant. She gives the character the\nemotional fragility that she needs as\nwell as the obvious beauty required.\nBut watching her, I almost always\nfelt that I was watching Kidman play\nanother role rather than observing a\ncompletely new character.\nThe director effectively uses many\nclose-up shots of Kidman\u2019s face\nto display her reactions to highly\ncharged situations. Whist this works\nfor Anna because we know her general mindset, Glazer tends to overuse this technique to show the emotions of other characters who we\nknow nothing about.\nThis includes Cameron Bright who\nplays young Sean convincingly and\neerily well. You may remember him\nas the psychotic boy in Godsend.\nHere he doesn\u2019t have homicidal ten-dencies, but there is undoubtedly an\nundercurrent of instability with this\nkid. He interacts well with Anna,\nbeing open with her but at the same\ntime hiding from her his true pur-pose.\nA lot goes unsaid in this film and\nthere is a deep feeling of repressed\nemotion throughout, making it feel\nheavy and laborious. That said, I\nthink it would have benefited from\nmoredialogue,astherewaspotential\nfor some great emotional exchanges\nbetween Kidman and Bacall when\nthey came to odds.\nSo with its stellar cast and a creative if slightly unusual premise,\nwhat does this film really deliver?\nUnfortunately, not that much. It\nstarts off telling one story, changes\nits mind halfway through and takes\non another. Its slightly supernatural\ntact eventually takes the easy option\nand gives us a simple and slightly\ndisappointing explanation.\nThis doesn\u2019t make the most of the\nstory\u2019s most interesting feature: the\nenigma of the boy Sean. The mystery of the story is also underplayed\nbecause Glazer decides instead to\nfocus on the emotional reactions of\nthe character. He also falls short in\nconcentrating on creating depth for\nthe central characters whilst leaving the supporting cast rather two-dimensional.\nAnna and her husband\u2019s relationship is never fully explored. This is a\nshame, since the film is based on the\nfact that Anna loved her husband so\nmuch that she suspends all rational\nthought and is prepared to begin a\nrelationship with a ten-year-old boy.\nThis led to great controversy surrounding the film.

    "content": "The US election has been run and\nwon. There\u2019s been plenty of analysis on this result, but what of the\nnations that have been supporting\nBush\u2019s war on terror?\nSurrounding the US elections are\ndemocratic events in the two countries that have supported the US\nmost strongly since 9/11. Australia\nwent to the polls in early October\nthis year, and the British general\nelection is hotly tipped to take place\nwithin the next six months.\nWhile Australia voted in the context of a then undecided America,\nBritain\u2019s electorate will vote on Tony\nBlair in light of a Bush victory. How\nmuch influence is exerted by the US\npolls in these two countries? What\nbalance of domestic to foreign policy\nwas struck in Australia, and what\nbalance will be found in Britain?\nDoes the US and the war on terror\nexert any real influence at all in\nthese two countries?\nAUSTRALIA\nBy Duncan Pearse\nDo you remember those posters the\nanti-war crowd put up following the\nSpanish elections in March? They\nlisted the three names \u201cAznar, Bush,\nBlair\u201d. Aznar was crossed out to signify the \u2018no Iraq war\u2019 vote that had\njust swept the Spanish President\nfrom office.\nAs we now know, the poster makers have not had the chance to cross\noff George W Bush\u2019s name from\nthat list. It\u2019s also a good thing for\nthem they didn\u2019t list the name of\nJohn Howard, the Australian Prime\nMinister. Like Aznar and Blair, he\u2019s\nbeen a big supporter of the war on\nterror since 9/11, and sent troops to\nIraq, but in the Australian elections\nwhich were held on 9 October he\nwon a historic fourth term of office\nwith a swing to his conservative\ncoalition government.\nBefore I go on, I must declare\nan interest here \u2013 I am a member\nJohn Howard\u2019s Liberal Party, and\nhave worked for them in the past in\nAustralia.\nFor the uninitiated, Australian\ndemocracy is based upon the\nWestminster system, with national\ngovernment terms lasting three\nyears. The parliament consists of a\nlower house with 150 seats, and a\ndirectly elected upper house with 76\nSenators.\nIn the 9 October elections, the\nHoward government (a coalition\nbetween the Liberal and National\nparties) was asking the people for\na fourth term in office since sending the Labor party to opposition in\n1996. At a time when a government\nis normally regarded as tired and\nstale, the people gave the Liberal\nParty a 3% increase in its primary\nvote, with the coalition enjoying a\n1.8% swing on a two-party preferred\nbasis. The coalition\u2019s majority in the\nlower house increased from 14 seats\nto 24 seats. Many Coalition seats\nthat were once marginal now suddenly enjoy a buffer of 5% or more.\nSimultaneously, the Labor Party\u2019s\nprimary vote continued its long-term\nslide, losing five seats. Crucially as\nwell, the Government won a majority in the Senate \u2013 the first time a\ngovernment has achieved this in\naround twenty years. This result\nwas not a landslide, but it was in the\nballpark.\nBefore the election, the \u2018peace\u2019\ncrowd were licking their chops, just\nwaiting to see yet another of Bush\u2019s\ninternational allies bite the dust over\nIraq as Aznar had done earlier.\nPost election, the malcontents\u2019\nline was that the only reason for the\ngovernment\u2019s return was that Iraq\nhardly featured in the election cam-paign. This is supposed to explain\nwhy the electorate didn\u2019t give the\nPM the whipping they\u2019d been gagging to deliver for three years now.\nTrue enough, there was plenty of\nfocus on domestic policies during\nthe campaign: a government scare\ncampaign on interest rates, the significance of which was overplayed\nby Labor after they lost; a disgraceful attempt at voter bribery by the\ngovernment with a $13bn budget\nsurplus spending spree, which\nbackfired as the public rightly saw\nthis spending as irresponsible; and\nfinally, Labor\u2019s deal to snag Green\npreferences in return for saving old\ngrowth forests, resulting in logging\nworkers feeling betrayed by Labor\nyet again and voting conservative.\nAll of this \u2013 especially the Green\nissue \u2013 was very important to the\ngovernment\u2019s win, but none of it\nmeant that Iraq and the war on terror were irrelevant to the voters. If\nthe public were as furious about our\ninvolvement in the war on terror as\nthe anti-war crowd claim, then they\nwouldn\u2019t simply forget that anger\nbecause of some domestic issues\narising during a six-week election\ncampaign.\nGiven that Australia does have\ntroops in Iraq \u2013 and that their presence is physically small but politically important for President Bush\n\u2013 it was surprising to see during the\ncampaign that the war as an issue\nwas notable only by its absence. As\nI have mentioned, those lamenting\nLabor\u2019s defeat claimed this was the\nonly reason Howard had won.\nReally? And what if Howard had\nlost? I have no doubt that the \u2018peace\u2019\ncrowd would have seen it as a punishment of Howard for going into\nIraq, despite its absence from the\ncampaign as an election issue. You\ncan\u2019t have it both ways, folks.\nI\u2019m more inclined to believe that\nIraq was not an election issue\nbecause the debate on the war on\nterrorandnationalsecurityhadbeen\nrun and won by the Government a\nlong while ago. There is a strong\nargument to say that campaigns\nthemselves don\u2019t actually influence\nmany votes at all \u2013 what matters\nare the impressions formed by voters over the years leading up to the\nelection.\nAgainst this background, it is rea-sonabletoarguethatvotersapproved\nof the Government\u2019s backing of the\nwar on terror \u2013 Afghanistan, Iraq\nand all.\nJohn Howard openly supported\nBush\u2019s war on terror, and still does.\nJust about every issue that surrounded the Iraq war here in the\nUK was replicated in Australia \u2013 no\nWMDs, intelligence failures, enquiries into intelligence failures, accusations that the Government had lied\nabout the reasons for going to war,\nand so on. Australia\u2019s involvement\nin Iraq took place under the full\nglare of public protest and criticism,\nso there was every chance for the\nGovernment to look bad over the\nwhole affair, and every chance for\nvoters to punish it at the ballot box.\nSure, Australia had thousands of\npeople marching against the war\non the same weekend as a million\nor two protested in London. But\nwhat the anti-war crowd have never\ngrasped is that that says nothing\nabout the people who didn\u2019t go to\nprotest. Maybe they agreed with the\nprotesters. But maybe they didn\u2019t\n\u2013 and after the election we\u2019ve seen\nin Australia, it appears to me that a\nlot of people who stayed home actually didn\u2019t agree with the \u2018no war at\nall costs\u2019 line, while those who did\nhit the streets were probably not\ngoing to vote for someone like John\nHoward anyway.\nEarlier this year, Labor leader\nMark Latham sat down to a radio\ninterview and \u2018announced\u2019 that\nLabor\u2019s policy was to bring the\nAussie troops home from Iraq by\nChristmas. Then there came the\nquestions \u2013 would that be all of the\ntroops in the area, or just the ones\nactually on the ground in Iraq?\nWhat about the fact that many of\nthese troops were there to protect Australian aid workers in the\nregion? With the passage of time\nmore and more of Latham\u2019s front-benchers struggled to answer these\nquestions.\nAlso very telling were the disappointing results for the Greens and\nthe other left-of-centre minor par-ties. This went very heavily against\nthe pattern of Australian voting.\nUsually, the punters like to take out\ninsurance \u2013 especially when electing a conservative government. If\nsomeone like Howard is going to be\ntheir Prime Minister, then the voters will usually give the upper house\nthe balance of power to a minor\nparty just to keep the Government\nin check.\nThe results were disappointing for\nthe Greens, whose quasi-religious\nworship of the environment goes\nhand-in-hand with their opposition\nto war. Their primary vote did rise\nfrom 5% to 7%, but they did not win\na lower house seat, nor did they gain\nthe Senate balance of power as they\nhad hoped. If the voters wanted to\ntemper Howard\u2019s support for the\nwar on terror with increased Green\npresence in the Senate, they had\ntheir chance. Instead, they gave a\nSenate majority to the Howard gov-ernment.\nIn a nutshell, the voters didn\u2019t\nwant to be bribed with big election\nspending, they didn\u2019t want \u2018troops\nhome by Christmas\u2019 gimmicks, and\nthey didn\u2019t want any power to go to\nthe anti-war minor parties. Against\nthat background, it\u2019s no wonder that\nLabor did not buy a single TV advertisement slot to campaign against\nthe Iraq war. They knew the game\nwas up long ago in this debate. In\nshort, the Australian public support\nthe war on terror and their alliance\nwith the US \u2013 and have done for\nsome time now.\nGREAT BRITAIN\nBy Barry Edmonstone\nHaving seen the electoral fortunes of\ntwo distinctly pro-war anglophiles,\nwe must now look forward to the\nBritish elections in May. Tony Blair\nand the Labour party will be defending a majority of 159 seats, which\nin a 659 seat Parliament is a large\nmargin to play with, especially given\nthe nature of the core constituencies that Labour hold. The Labour\nparty has, however, been criticized,\nmuch like Howard and Bush, for its\npolicies both at home and abroad.\nSince the beginning of this\nParliament, the Labour government\nhas forced through a number of contentious issues. These have covered\na broad spectrum from foundation\nhospitals, through university top-up\nfees, to anti-terrorism legislation,\nregional assemblies and now the\nhunting bill. These issues have all\nled to protests, the likes of which\nhave not been seen since the late\n1980s. Not only that, but each of\nthese issues has managed to anger\na different section of society \u2013 from\nyoung to old, from rich to poor and\nfrom north to south, no-one has\nbeen left untouched.\nOn the international stage, things\nare not much better \u2013 Afghanistan,\nIraq and the EU debates have\nnot been vote-winners either.\nAfghanistan and Iraq have been\nseen as reckless wars in support of\nan overly aggressive superpower.\nAlthough the charge of being led\nto war by others is overly critical,\nBritish troops are yet again dying in\nforeign field. This is something that\nwe should all stop to remember this\nweek. From a constructive position,\nthe issues over the next few months\nwill be creating a lasting peace and\nextracting our troops in a safe man-ner. However, many feel that this is a\ntask beyond the powers and abilities\nof our government.\nThe EU has played a secondary\nrole due to the crisis in Iraq, but the\nview of most to Brits again seems to\nbe out of step with the Government.\nIn the European elections, the\noutlook for Labour was decidedly\ngloomy. In the last nationwide test\nof public opinion before the general election, Labour were soundly\nbeaten by the Conservative party,\n27 MEPs to 19. Not only that, but\nthe UK Independence Party (UKIP),\na marginal party at best, polled a\nmassive 16% of the vote, only 6%\nbehind Labour and forcing the\nLiberal Democrats into fourth place.\nThis should have sounded a warning\nbell about a rise of parties on the\nright of the political spectrum. Yet\nno change in the Labour position\nseems to have been forthcoming.\nIt is surprising then to see that\nthe Government still has so much\nsupport, even when most of these\nissues go against the grain of the\npublic at large as well as against the\nbeliefs of the \u2018traditional\u2019 Labour\nvoter.\nIn May, Tony Blair is expected to\nwin his third term of office with a\ncomfortable majority of between 30\nand 75 seats. This view seems to\nhave been strengthened given the\nBush victory and the recent result\nfrom Australia.\nThe question remains: how can\nsuch a range of unpopular decisions lead to another parliamentary\nmajority? Well first we have to consider the strength of the opposition.\nThe Conservative party should be\nthe main challengers in this elec-tion, but they are a party in disarray.\nThey lack confidence, ability and\na proven winner. At the end of the\nday, Michael Howard will always be\nremembered as a loser who went\ndown with the Major government.\nSo we look further afield to the\nLiberal Democrats, the up and coming political party with the popular\nview of the war in Iraq, and the\nchoice of the young professional.\nWell, that\u2019s how they would like to\nbe seen, but it\u2019s not really the case.\nAlthough they will make the largest gains at the next election, and\ncould possibly become the official\nopposition, they will not make the\ngains they require to affect Labour\u2019s\nmajority. The minor parties may\npick up seats here and there, but\nthe lack of cohesion in all of these\norganisations will undoubtedly be\ntheir downfall.\nHowever, the most important factor will be the voices of the voters we have yet to hear. These are\nnot the protesters or the politically\nmotivated, but the silent majority\nwho have had enough of pandering to the most vocal minorities.\nThis group has been the deciding\nfactors in both the Australian and\nAmerican elections and they are\ncautious centre-right voters. This is\na much-maligned group, especially\nin Britain, but we will certainly hear\ntheir voice at the next election. They\nvoted for Blair in 1997 and have supported him since. They are unhappy,\nbut they have not abandoned the\nLabour party just yet.\nThe Australians and Americans\nhave decided. It will be our choice\nin less than six months, and the only\nway to change things that you don\u2019t\nagree with is to go out and vote.\nCOMMENT felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 25 November 2004 9\nElections around the world\nAfter George W Bush\u2019s triumph, Felix analyses the Australian and British elections\nDUNCAN PEARSE\n\n"

Many indigenous\nlanguages have no words for\nthe new animals, insects and\nplants advancing north as global warming thaws the polar\nice and lets forests creep\nover tundra. \u201cWe can\u2019t even\ndescribe what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d\nsaid the chair of the Inuit\nCircumpolar Conference.\nCould antimatter be used to create superbombs?\nBy Kate Wighton\nScience communication\nEarly last month, The San\nFrancisco Chronicle alleged\nthat the US Air Force was\nquietly spending millions\nof dollars on an antimatter\nweapons project.\nThis program could produce the superweapons of\nthe future. Antimatter bombs\ncould be hand-held but also\nbe extremely powerful \u2013 since\nhalf a gram of antimatter\nwould release energy equivalent to that of the Hiroshima\nbomb.\nThe US Air Force were, the\nChronicle claims, initially\nquite open about the project,\nbut following initial enquiries,\nemployees were forbidden to\ndiscuss it.\nAt first glance, this appears\nvery alarming. But are antimatter weapons really pos-sible?\nFirst of all, what is antimat-ter? Antimatter first came\nto the attention of scientists\nin 1930, when as part of a\ntheory describing the behaviour of electrons, Paul Dirac\npredicted the electron to\nhave an equivalent positive-ly-charged partner: the anti-electron. This was treated\nwith some scepticism until\n1932 when Carl Anderson\nactually observed a particle\nthat behaved like an electron\nbut was a positively charged\n\u2013 this was the first evidence of\nthe anti-electron, or positron.\nSince then, antimatter partners have been found for the\nother sub-atomic particles\nthat make up matter, such\nas anti-protons and anti-neu-trons. When antimatter and\nmatter collide, they annihilate\neach other to produce huge\namounts of energy, hence the\nmilitary\u2019s interest in using\npositron bombs.\nAntimatter would produce\n\u2018clean\u2019 superbombs. Dan\nBowerman, who works on the\nBaBar antimatter project at\nImperial College, explains:\n\u201c[using positrons] would be\nuseful as basically all material matter on earth has many,\nmany electrons so positrons\nwould annihilate with them.\nThis would give off lots of\nenergy and no pollutants\nwhile causing much damage\nfrom the enormous amounts\nof energy produced\u201d.\nCERN, which sits on the\nSwiss-French border, is the\nworlds largest particle physics centre. The centre generates and investigates antimatter (although there are\nother institutions that generate antimatter \u2013 the Stanford\nLinear Accelerator Center\n(SLAC) being one with which\nImperial is closely associated\nvia the BaBar project). Rather\nhandily, the CERN website\ncontains the question: \u201cCan\nwe make antimatter bombs?\u201d\nTheir answer was reassuringly to the point: \u201cThere is no\npossibility to make antimatter\nbombs\u201d.\nPhew. The main reason\nappears to be that antimatter\nis incredibly difficult to store\nand can, therefore, not be\naccumulated in high enough\nquantities. Bowerman\nexplains: \u201cit is relatively easy\nto create positrons, but storing them is another business\nand storing them over potentially long periods of time\nshould be very difficult and\nalso very expensive\u201d.\nIf antimatter comes into\ncontact with matter, it will\nannihilate. Therefore, finding something to store them\nin (bearing in mind that our\nworld is made up of matter)\nis very difficult. The fact that\nthe particles bear the same\ncharge and therefore repel\neach other makes things even\nmore challenging.\nAnother tricky point about\nantimatter is that there\nappears to be little, if any,\nantimatter in the universe.\nThis has been puzzling scientists for years as it is thought\nthat matter and antimatter\nwere produced in equal quantities in the Big Bang. As we\nhave no natural resource of\nantimatter as we do coal or\noil, all antimatter has to be\nmade artificially.\nThis involves accelerating particles to the speed of\nlight in huge particle accel-erators, and smashing them\ninto smaller particles, some\nof which decay into antiparti-cles. However, these antiparticles fly off in all directions at\nvery high speeds. Therefore,\nonly the particles that fly off\nin a certain direction can be\ncaught, making the process of\ngenerating antimatter rather\ninefficient. The amount of\nantimatter produced each\nyear at CERN could power\na 100W bulb for just 15 min-utes.\nAs the CERN website\nexplains: \u201cScientists realised\nthat the atom bomb was a\nreal possibility many years\nbefore one was actually built\nand exploded, and then the\npublic was totally surprised\nand amazed. The antimatter\nbomb on the other hand has\nbeen imagined by the public\nwho want to know more about\nit, yet we have known for a\nvery long time that it\u2019s not at\nall a practical device\u201d.\nOn the general topic of\nmilitary research, Bowerman\nhad this to add: \u201cWith enough\nresources, scientists can\noften come up with very\nclever technologies that you\ncan\u2019t initially imagine and the\nmilitary has the resources to\nmake this happen.\nHe continued: \u201cLet\u2019s hope\nthat the costs remain very\nhigh and the US military\ndominance makes it somewhat pointless to pursue\nthese technologies\u201d.\nTherefore it looks, for the\nmoment, as though we don\u2019t\nhave to worry about antimatter weapons wiping humanity\noff the face of the Earth. After\nall, we already have perfectly\nadequate nuclear and biological weapons to do that.\nAntimatter bombs would be devastating in theory, but\nwould they ever work in practice?\nBy Sonja van Renssen\nScience communication\nScience and beauty: two completely unrelated subjects you\nmight think at first glance,\nthe first cold and empirical,\nthe second forever subject\nto personal opinion with no\nsmall dose of passion thrown\nin. However, at the Royal\nInstitute on Wednesday 10\nNovember, Dr Armand Marie\nLeroi, Reader in Evolutionary\nDevelopmental Biology at\nImperial College, argued that\nscience now provides a credible explanation for beauty in\nthe human face.\nThis has not always been\nperceived to be the case.\nUntil the Renaissance, beauty was defined by symme-try: the geometry of facial\nfeatures in statues of the\ntime reflects this definition\nof physical perfection. It was\nwith the publication in 1871 of\nThe Descent of Man, wherein\nCharles Darwin extended his\nconcept of sexual selection\nfrom animals to man, that\nbeauty was for the first time\ndefined in scientific terms:\nas rare, particular and totally\narbitrary.\nResearch since has\nreversed each of these original beliefs: scientists today\nbelieve that beauty is not\nwhat is rare but what is com-mon, not particular but uni-versal, and not arbitrary but\nrich in meaning. For example,\nSir Francis Galton, Darwin\u2019s\nown cousin, demonstrated\nthat people tend to find an\naverage face more beautiful\nthan one that deviates significantly from the norm. Studies\nasking men to rate women\nin terms of appearance have\nshown cultural invariance.\nAnd who can doubt that beauty has meaning when we are\nbeginning to speak of a \u201cglobal standard of beauty\u201d and\nthere is a multi-million pound\nindustry devoted to it?\nIn addition to these three\ndefining traits, there is one\nother that Dr Marie Leroi\nhas identified as particularly\ninteresting and of consequence for a complete explanation of beauty: its role as a\ncertificate of health. A person\nlacking the scars of small-pox, free of an infestation of\nlice or devoid of scurvy is\nclearly more attractive than\none who suffers from any of\nthese afflictions. In modern\nBritish society, most of us\nenjoy a reasonably good level\nof health. So why is it that\nthere are still such significant\ndifferences in beauty?\nThe reason, believes Dr\nMarie Leroi, is that beauty\ntoday is largely a function of\nour genetic make-up (nature),\nrather than the environment\nin which we live (nurture).\nIn a classic case of nature\nversus nurture, he argues in\nfavour of a dominant role for\nnature: \u201ca great deal of variation in beauty is due to variation in our genetic load\u2026\nwe are all born with around\n300 mutations that affect our\nbodies for the worse in one\nway or another... nearly all...\naffect the face\u201d.\nThe evidence for this theory\ncomes from observations that\npeople of mixed race are often\nextraordinarily beautiful. A\ngood example is Saira Mohan,\nwho featured on the cover of\nNewsweek in November 2003\nas the most beautiful face in\nthe world. Saira is a quarter\nIrish, a quarter French and\nhalf Punjabi.\nDr Marie Leroi argues\nthat her beauty stems from\na lower than average number\nof mutations as a result of her\nmixed race heritage: because\nmutations are almost always\nrecessive, they will only be\nexpressed if two copies, one\nfrom the father and one from\nthe mother, are present. The\nless genetically similar two\npeople are, for example if\nthey stem from two different\nraces rather than the same,\nthe lower the chance of them\nsharing the same mutations.\nIf \u201cbeauty is the absence of\nimperfections\u201d as Dr Marie\nLeroi contends, then the\nexpression of fewer mutations in people of mixed race\nexplains their greater beauty.\nIn this way, empirical science explains the subjective.\nYet, it must be borne in mind\nthat there is also a strong\ncultural component at play\nhere. Would people of mixed\nrace have been considered\nquite so beautiful in a less\nracially tolerant society of\npast times? Probably not.\nWhile Dr Marie Leroi\u2019s theory is very plausible in today\u2019s\nsociety, it remains to be seen\nwhether it will stand the test\nof time.\n\u25cf For details on upcoming events at the Royal\nInstitute: www.ri.ac.uk\nScience attempts to comprehend the mystery of beauty\nMore than skin deep? Science is trying to explain beauty\n\u201c...half a gram of\nantimatter would\nrelease energy\nequivalent to that of\na Hiroshima bomb\u201d\n\u201cScientists today\nbelieve that beauty is\nnot what is rare but\nwhat is common, not\nparticular but univer-sal, and not arbitrary\nbut rich in meaning\u201d\n\n"

From then\non, motivated by their chubby\ncaptain, the Medicals played\nlike a transformed side to\nthat of recent weeks.\nBrunel kicked off with a\nstrong wind behind them. Fly\nhalf James Morris opened\nthe scoring, striking the ball\nbetween the sticks to put the\nmedics 3\u20130 up. Brunel pushed\nback hard and exposed holes\nin the medics defence. The\ncontinual battering of the\nmedics back line eventually\nled to the Brunel inside centre clearing the line and duly\nconverting to make the score\n7 -3 to Brunel.\nAgain a strong forward\nperformance from the medic\npack, who dominated for 80\nminutes, created several\ntry scoring opportunities\nwhich were squandered by\nthe three quarters, although\nthe pressure culminated in\na deserved pushover try by\nthe medics tight five beneath\nthe posts.\nBoth sides continually\ninfringed throughout the first\nhalf as the London Society\nReferee maintained a strong\npresence and kept the two\nbattling sides under control.\nThis was to the detriment of\nlose head Xander Ancock, giving away a penalty for holding\non within kicking distance of\nthe medics posts and allowing Brunel to pull the score\nto 10 apiece at half time and\nwinning himself 10 minutes in\nthe sin bin.\nThe medics scrum continued to dominate in the second\nhalf, allowing powerhouse\nPete Russell to take the medics ahead with his superb\nindividual try to the right of\nthe posts. This try ended the\nscoring for Brunel who for\nthe majority of the first half\nlooked dominant.\nWith the Medicals back\non 15 men, Morris and his\ntwo wingers perked up and\nprovided some much needed\nstrength to a lacklustre back\nline. Players worked harder\nto fill in and the defence\nstood strong. Forwards\nwere able to retain the ball,\nwith second half possession\nbeing over 65% in the medics favour. Unforced errors\nwere also minimised and the\nside provided coaches Rollitt\nand Hamilton Eadie with the\nrugby they have been striving for.\nRussell got his second try,\nalong with Sinnett touching\ndown for one and hungry\nCameron Sullivan clearing\nthe line on several occasions.\nRollitt made his changes\nwith 20 minutes to go, moving Jonnie Ward to blind side\nflanker, Watchorn back on for\nanother 15 minutes at tight\nhead and lightning Mark\nWillsdon replacing try scoring\nPiers Thomas on the wing.\nThe awesome medic pack,\ntired of dictating the game to\nBrunel, provided Morris with\nmore ball and created superb\ntries for Huw Williams. One of\nthe finest pieces of individual\nplayinthematchledtoHumor\nGurney touching down under\nthe posts. With the medics\ndishing out 42 points in the\nsecond half with no response,\nRussell can finally be proud of\na performance fit for Imperial\nMedicals First XV.\nRUGBY\nMixed hockey fun\n2nd annual Royal\nHolloway Mixed Hockey\nTournament\nBy Pikey\nOn Sunday 14 November, 18\nintrepid souls from Imperial\nCollege Hockey Club met at\nthe Union for the short trip\nto Staines to participate in\n(and attempt to win) the 2nd\nAnnual Royal Holloway Mixed\nHockey Tournament.\nWe all desperately\nattempted to load ourselves\ninto Chardonnay\u2019s wheels of\nsteel but unfortunately there\naren\u2019t 18 seats in a Vauxhall\nCorsa so the rest of us, ie\nall of the boys plus Moonie\nand Spanner, had to travel\nin Mothercare\u2019s minibus of\ndeath.\nDespite the GPS navigation system on Bleeding\nDick\u2019s phone telling us to do\na U-turn \u201cimmediately\u201d on\nthe Hammersmith flyover,\nwe duly arrived at Staines\nhockey club safely and fashionably early for an Imperial\nteam. So early in fact that\nthey had only just opened\nthe pitch. Still, that meant\nplenty of time for the traditional Imperial warm-up of\nsmashing or drag-flicking all\nthe balls we had bought at\nthe goal, though in truth most\nended up over the fence.\nSoon the other teams\narrived, from UCL, Barts,\nQueen Mary\u2019s, Royal Vets, St\nGeorges and Oxford Brookes.\nOur 18 players were duly split\ninto two \u2018equal\u2019 teams, though\nsomeone seemingly forgot to\nsuggest that we had an equal\nmix of attackers and defenders on each, which made\nposition picking interesting.\nPikey took control of the A\nteam, whilst Chardonnay led\nthe Bs.\nThe tournament took the\nform of a round robin group\nstage with the top four from\neach group going through to\nthe quarter finals.\nBoth Imperial teams qualified for the quarter finals, and\nthe B\u2019s were up against UCL\nA\u2019s first. Six minutes each\nway was not enough to separate the sides and the game\nwent to penalties. Moonie,\nwho had by this stage cut\nboth her knees and had a\nlump the size of a ping-pong\nball on one stepped up to take\nthe first and was unlucky to\nsee it saved. Sieve then saved\nbrilliantly from UCL\n\u2019s first\nto keep us in the shootout.\nBrandon Lee then stepped\nup and slotted the second\npenalty home, which heaped\nthe pressure on UCL. They\ncrumbled and failed to score\nagain. It all rested on George\nHarrison. How could we\ndoubt him! UCL were beaten,\nand the B\u2019s were through to\nthe semis.\nThe A team had a tough\ndraw against Holloway A\u2019s\nwho had steamrollered everyone in their group games. The\ngame was tight and Imperial\nwere leading 2-1 at half time\nthanks to Essex Wideboy\nslaloming through the entire\nHolloway team before tucking\nit neatly away in the top left\nhand corner and Spellcheck\u2019s\ncomical goal from a short cor-ner. In the second half, we\nwere poor, they got two and\nthe A\u2019s were out.\nIn the semis, the B team\nfaced Oxford Brookes who\nafter a poor start had shaken\noff their minibus blues and\nwere playing as well as we\nthought they would. They\nduly won though not through\na lack of effort from Imperial,\nespecially Moonie who again\nspent time scraping herself\noff the astroturf on several\noccasions but played on.\nThen the floodlights failed\nand the final was delayed,\nwhich allowed a few choice\nand comedy insults to be\nhurled at UCL in the dark.\nThe final was eventually\ncontested by UCL B and\nOxford Brookes A. Imperial\njoined the rest of the teams\nin abusing UCL, but they\nshrugged off our chants and\ndeservedly won.\nTheeveningwasroundedoff\nwith the raffle, where Essex\nWideboy and Bleeding Dick\ntook home prizes (Haribo\nand a \u2018luxury\u2019 toiletries set to\nbe precise, so we have team\nshower gel and food to last for\nseveral weeks at least!)\nNotable memories from the\nday included:\nEssex Wideboy single-hand-edly attempting to score all\nthe goals for the A-team to\nget them through and doing\na pretty good job, though he\ntook a rollocking from Top\nHeavy for giving the ball away\nonce! How sweet.\nPikey taking a substantial squirtfull of port from a\nsuper-soaker whilst umpiring Oxford Brookes versus\nBarts as punishment for bad\ndecisions \u2013 many thanks to\nthe Shelly from Queen Mary\nfor that! Also a big hand to\nhim for playing as sweeper\nwhich was way out of position\nas he is usually to be found\nswinging off the opponents\u2019\ncrossbar in the search of that\nelusive nick to claim a goal.\nMothercare continuing\nhis passion for arguing with\numpires and nearly starting a\nmass brawl with Royal Vets.\nBrandon Lee, for scoring\ngoals... apparently?\nTight Lips\u2019 performance\nin goal in replacement of\nSpanner who, because of the\n\u20183 girls on the pitch at all\ntimes rule\u2019, was forced to play\nin defence!\nItalian Job, steady at the\nback as ever.\nSieve\u2019s great goalkeeping\nand also his ability to hunt\ndown and destroy the pikey\nOxford Brookes keeper who\ntried to nick his kit.\nToo Keen for being there\nwithout his contact lenses\n\u2013 did you actually touch the\nball?\nBig thanks to the rest for\nturning up.\nHOCKEY\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 14\nUCL Women\u2019s 1st 2\nBy Lizzie Wortley\nFrom the quiet beginnings\nin the changing room, where\nMichelle attempted to rally\nthe troops, Imperial\u2019s women\u2019s lacrosse team went on\nto have their best team game\nyet.\nAn early goal by UCL was\ntypical of our slow start, but\nwe soon responded, coming\nback with a force of our own.\nHannah was beautifully on\ntarget and two speedy goals\nset up the form of the game.\nAlthough UCL often had\npossession of the ball, our\nbrilliant defence were not to\nbe beaten. Shivani with her\nferocious turquoise stick had\nthe UCL girls withering in\nour path.

    "content": "There are myriads of productions\ngracing London\u2019s stages. There\u2019s\na bit of everything: comedy, musi-cals, drama, dance, opera and more.\nHowever, in my opinion, one production stands out at the moment: the\nRoyal Ballet\u2019s revived Sylvia. You\nwill be hard pressed to find anything\nmore gloriously enchanting on any\nstage.\nThis year is the centenary of the\nRoyal Ballet\u2019s founding choreog-rapher, Sir Frederick Ashton, and\nin celebration a large selection of\nAshton ballets form the core of the\nRoyal Ballet\u2019s season.\nYou may find it surprising, I know\nI did, but ballet is really something\nof a \u2018new art\u2019 to Britain. The first\ntwo permanent companies were set\nup during Ashton\u2019s lifetime, 1904-88, including what has become the\nRoyal Ballet. Sir Frederick had a\nhand in setting up both of these\nearly companies.\nHaving started his ballet training\nin secret, Ashton rose to prominence as a dancer, but most notably\nas a choreographer. He was prolific,\nbut did not like to have his work\ndocumented, something he was to\nregret in later life as it became clear\nto him that this would somewhat\nimpede his works\u2019 chances of survival after his own demise. Many of\nhis ballets have remained in the repertoire from their premiers, such\nas Cinderella (score by Prokofiev)\nand La Fille Mal Gard\u00e9e (music\nby H\u00e9rold but \u201cfreely adapted and\narranged\u201d by John Lanchbery),\nbut some such as Sylvia have been\nvery nearly or entirely lost. This has\nmade the revival of Sylvia all the\nmore triumphant.\nLovingly recreated from sketches,\narchive materials and the memories\nof dancers who performed the roles\nduring Ashton\u2019s lifetime, Sylvia is a\ntruly spectacular achievement. The\nrole of Sylvia, and so the entire bal-let, was created for Margot Fonteyn,\nthe most talented and sparkling\ndancer of the age who was also honoured by the Royal Ballet with the\ntitle of \u201cPrima Ballerina Assoluta\u201d,\nin the fifties.\nThe score for the ballet is by L\u00e9o\nDelibes, of Lakm\u00e9 fame (the Flower\nDuet hijacked by British Airways\nis from this opera), and includes\nat least one piece that most will\nrecognise: the Pizzicato, which incidentally is also the music to which\nSylvia\u2019s showpiece dance is set.\nSylvia\u2019s plot is simple and clas-sic. The hero, Aminta, a shepherd,\nfalls in love with the unattainable\nSylvia. Sylvia, one of the goddess\nDiana\u2019s huntresses, does not return\nAminta\u2019s affections and shoots him.\nMiraculously, the god Eros saves\nAminta and also makes Sylvia fall\nmadly in love with him. However,\nSylvia is also admired by Orion, and\nin her besotted state is then abducted by him. As we all know, Aminta\u2019s\nlove must triumph so Sylvia is able\nto escape Orion with the help of\nEros and be reunited with her \u2018true\u2019\nlove. However, a final hurdle to happiness exists, Diana, who doesn\u2019t\ncondone such liaisons and so must\nbe won over.\nThree pairs of dancers take the\nprincipal roles of Sylvia and Aminta,\nand the role of Orion is also rotated \u2013 ballet is, after all, a beautiful\nbut hugely physically demanding\nart form. The three trios are as\nfollows: Darcey Bussell, Jonathan\nCope, Thiago Soares; Zenaida\nYanowsky, David Makhateli, Gary\nAvis; Marianela Nunez, Rupert\nPennefather, Viacheslav Samodurov.\nWhile Darcey Bussell is undoubtedly the most recognisable name in\nthe list, the cast that has received\nmost critical acclaim has been that\nlead by Marianela Nunez. However,\nno cast has gone without praise.\nI had the pleasure of seeing the\nballet, quite recently, with Darcey\nBussell as Sylvia. Yes, she was a\nlittle tall, and at times (particularly\nin the final Act, if I am to believe\nthe gentlemen sitting next to us)\nrescued from near catastrophe by\nJonathan Cope (Aminta), but none\nof this took away from a thoroughly\nenjoyable performance. To be perfectly honest I didn\u2019t notice the near\ncatastrophes and I\u2019m sure that outside of the very knowledgeable section of the audience few will have\ndone so either \u2013 we were all to\nbusy being swept away by the sheer\nbeauty of the entire company\u2019s per-formance.\nNot only is the production visually\nstriking as a result of the dancers\nand the choreography, the costumes\nand the scenery are also stunning.\nThe costumes and scenery have\nbeen reproduced to be faithful to the\noriginal production and so have a\nbeautiful feel of fifties elegance and\ngrace about them. The colours are\nwonderful and the costumes, whose\ndetails have all been hand painted,\nas delicate as can be.\nSylvia runs until 3 December. If\nyou can at all get tickets then do so,\nyou will not be disappointed. If you\ncannot manage to see Sylvia then\nthere are many more Ashton ballets\nto be savoured this season. Check\nthe Royal Opera House\u2019s website,\nwww.roh.org.uk, for details and cast\nlists. One should really not pass\nup such an opportunity to discover,\nrediscover, or continue to enjoy the\nballet, or indeed to see the likes of\nDarcey Bussell and Carlos Acosta,\nwho is only with the Royal Ballet as\na visiting principal, dance.\nPaola Smith\nArts Editor\n\u25cf Booking will open for the Royal\nOpera House\u2019s Period Three of their\nseason on 7 December.

Degas used more conventional methods than many of his\ncontemporaries for preparing his\npieces. He would produce many\ntechnical studies before starting his\nfinal piece using linear composition\nand monochromatic layers, and only\nthen adding the layers of colour.\nThe exhibition analyses closely\nseveral works, most interestingly\nThe Young Spartans and Miss La\nLa at the Cirque Fernando. The\npresentation of the former includes\na full-scale study made around\n1860 and an X-ray of the final piece\nshowing significant changes made\nto it stretching over 10 or even 20\nyears. Such insight into the mind\nof the artist is extraordinarily rare;\nyou can see how he changed his\nmind about the composition of the\npiece, the positions of the figures,\nand even the changing of the faces\nfrom those of classical figures to\nmore playful faces of Parisian street\nurchins.\nMissLaLaattheCirqueFernando\nis a striking picture of a famous performer of Degas\u2019s time swinging by\nher teeth. The development of this\npainting includes several studies\nof the figure herself, and one of the\ncomplex architectural backdrop of\nthe piece. Indeed, examination of\nthe piece suggests that Degas had\ngreat difficulty with this aspect, and\nin the end employed an architectural draftsman to help him get it\nright.\nThe exhibition also includes a\nvideo that better explains Degas\u2019s\nmethods, including his use of tracing\npaper to create the series Russian\nDancers, his essence painting and\nhis use of monotype, a method he\npractically invented. Insights into\nhis famous waxwork modelling,\nwhich he turned to towards the end\nof his life as his eyesight became\nincreasingly worse, are also given,\nand the exhibition includes the\nmodel Dancer Looking at the Sole\nof her Right Foot.\nThis exhibition allows so much\ninsight into the workings of Degas,\nit almost seems like it is decon-structing a genius. However, when\nyou think of the methods he invent-ed, the complexity of his preparation and the attention he paid to\nevery detail of his works, it\u2019s impossible not to walk away in awe of this\nmaster.\nSir Frederick Ashton at work,\nchoreographing the Royal Ballet.\nBehind the gloss of the finished product\nEmily Lines discovers the difficulties Degas experienced with complex architecture\nA study made by Degas of a figure for one of his paintings\nArt in the Making: Degas\nNational Gallery, WC2\nHow did Degas work?\nAdmission FREE\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 25 November 2004 5\nScience science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nIn laboratories across the\nworld, animals are used to\ntest different drugs and com-pounds. In some cases, these\ndrugs are lifesaving treatments that will ultimately\nsave many peoples lives. In\nothers, it is a slightly different story, where animals are\nused to test cosmetics and\nother pleasurable products\ndesigned for our everyday\nuse.\nIs it right to use animals\nin this way, for human gain?\nShouldwedistinguishbetween\nthe use of animals in cancer\nlaboratories and the cosmetic\nindustry? Is one right and one\nwrong; one better or worse?\nThere are many questions to\nconsider. For example, are\nthere any alternatives? And\ndo these experiments really\nwork? This report will attempt\nto highlight the controversial\nissues and gain insight into\nthe facts behind animal test-ing. And then it will be up to\nyou...\nApproximately 2.7 million live animal experiments\nwere authorized in the UK\nin 2002. This may sound like\nan immense number, but it is\nhalf of what was carried out\n30 years ago. One reason for\nthe decline was the introduction of the Animal Act in 1986,\nstating that no animal experiments may be conducted if\nthere is a realistic alternative.\nHowever, British law states\nthat any new drug must be\ntested on at least two different species of mammal, one\nbeing a large non-rodent. So\nwhere is the middle ground?\nAnd what is a realistic alter-native?\nFirstly, one should address\nwhether testing on animals\nactually works and what is\ngained from such work. Many\npeople have received vaccines\nfor diseases such as polio,\nmeasles, mumps and tuberculosis (TB). We owe animal\ntesting for the development\nof such drugs. Furthermore,\nantibiotics, HIV drugs, insulin and anti-cancer treatments which have helped vast\namounts of people around\nthe world are all tested and\ndeveloped through the use of\nanimals.\nIs animal testing a \u2018necessary evil\u2019? Is the use of animals comparable to allowing\na human to die or suffer?\nAttempting to distinguish\nbetween what is morally right\nand wrong is difficult. Some\nwould comment that human\nlife has a greater intrinsic value than an animal.\nLegislation and strict government guidelines ensure that\nlab animals are protected\nfrom cruelty and mistreat-ment. But how much do we\nknow about the stress-related\neffects of testing, even if treated well?\nMany animals are put to\nsleep before feeling any pain.\nSuch procedures also follow\nstrict rules and regulations\non how to anaesthetise an animal prior to testing. Despite\nthis, isn\u2019t the whole process\ntraumatic for the animals?\nAlternatives to animal testing include in vitro studies.\nThis means studying the\nproblem outside the living ani-mal. For example, culturing\ncancer cells in a dish rather\nthan examining live animals\nor testing in vivo. However,\nmany scientists believe that\nin vitro studies are only a\nstarting point to providing\nbasic non-clinical testing. A\nclear picture is only gained\nwhen observing what is actually happening in an animal\nmodel.\nThe use of as few animals\nas possible is the primary aim\nof most medical researchers.\nThe search for alternatives\ncontinues and is guided by the\n\u2018three R\u2019s\u2019 principle; reduc-tion, refinement and replace-ment. As mentioned before,\nthere have been significant\nreductions in the number of\nanimals used over the last\n30 years. Refinement covers\nareas that include animal\nhousing and veterinary care.\nWhile animals are still being\nused, it ensures that they\nare treated with respect and\ncare. Replacement continues\nto strive to look for non-ani-mal alternatives. Techniques\nsuch as in vitro studies can\nreplace some animal experi-ments. However, it will be\nsome years until they can be\nreplaced completely.\nFurthermore, research\ninstitutes such as the infamous Huntingdon Life\nSciences are pioneering the\nin vitro technology. Also, it is\na supporter of the Fund for\nthe Replacement of Animals\nin Medical Experiments\n(FRAME). So despite current needs for animal-based\nresearch, scientists do\nacknowledge that reducing\nand replacing animal testing\nis the future.\nSuch controversial issues\nare always accompanied\nby supporters (both for and\nagainst). Many protests have\noccurred over various ethical\nissues. Recently, Cambridge\nUniversity had to abandon\nplans for a primate research\ncentre as costs had apparently escalated due to new animal welfare regulations and\nincreasing security measures.\nHowever, the centre still could\ngo ahead as planning permission is valid for 5 years.\nDespite the announcement\nthat the centre was going to\nbe axed, in July of this year\nanimal rights groups challenged the decision for planning permission for the centre\nin the high court. The appeal\nwas eventually overturned.\nMany medical research centres face similar costs concerning security against violent protestors. Animal rights\nterrorism was estimated to\nhave caused \u00a3150 million of\nproperty damage over the\nlast 25 years. Is it justified to\nattack scientists who are ultimately only doing their job?\nHowever, there are organisations that demonstrate peacefully such as Animal Aid and\nthe National Anti-Vivisection\nSociety, which strive to educate and promote animal\nrights.\nTo put animal testing in\ncontext, in the US 5bn animals were used in the food\nindustry compared to 18m for\nresearch, both of which benefit humans. Can we, should\nwe compare the two?\nOne could suggest that we\nall become vegetarians as\nwell as stopping testing on\nanimals. How far does it go?\nThere is no easy answer to\nmany questions posed in this\narticle. But hopefully, by reading this you are now more\naware of the controversial\npros and cons associated with\nanimal based research. At the\nend of the day, the answers\nand opinions are yours.\nIs animal testing a necessary or unnecessary evil?\nAnimal testing is a controversial issue which is driving research out of Britain. Emma Williams\nraises the questions that must be answered if science is to stay\nAnimal testing: do we have to be cruel to be kind? \u201cAnimal rights terrorism\nwas estimated to have\ncaused \u00a3150 million of\nproperty damage over\nthe last 25 years\u201d\nBy Zo\u00eb Corbyn\nScience communication\nThis week I added three plastic bags to my ever-increas-ing collection. I did try to keep\nit to a minimum \u2013 but life\ngot in the way. An emergency\nmilk outing and before I knew\nit my pint had been bundled\nup in plastic (if only they\nwould ask); it was raining and\na newspaper without a bag\nwould have been intolerable;\nand my new CD just had to\ncome home in one of those\ndinky wee ones.\nBased on this, my average\nrate of consumption is 150\nbags per year. By UK standards I am actually doing well,\nas the average is 290 plastic\nbags per person per year.\nIndeed, our plastic bag use\nhas reached epidemic propor-tions. As well as littering our\nenvironment and blocking\nour waterways, plastic bags\nkill large numbers of wildlife every year. Birds, whales,\nseals and turtles, often mistaking them for jellyfish,\ningest the bags. They do not\nbreakdown easily and stay in\ntheir intestines, causing pain\nand death. When the animals\ndo die, the bags are released\nback into the sea: ready to be\neaten again.\nIn an effort to curb our\naddiction, major supermarkets offer us \u2018lifetime bags\u2019\nand in the past there were\npenny saving incentives if we\nbrought our own. (Sainsbury\u2019s\ncanned their \u2018Penny Back\u2019\nscheme in July this year in\nfavour of improved instore\nrecycling points \u2013 apparently\nfew customers were using the\nscheme.)\nB&Q, however, are the\nfirst UK company to seriously integrate the challenge\nof plastic bag reduction into\ntheir company policy. Their\nnew scheme is simple: for\neach bag customers request\nat Scottish B&Q shops, five\npence is added to the bill,\ncharged through a barcode\non the bag. The money raised\nfrom the scheme goes to the\n\u2018Keep Scotland Beautiful\u2019\nscheme. If the trial is suc-cessful, it could be launched\nat B&Q shops across England\nand Wales.\nBut B&Q are only one com-pany. Surely, to really make\na difference we need a plastic bag tax to apply across\nthe board? Surely we need\nGovernment action? Well,\napparently not, and this is not\nlikely to change in the near\nfuture.\nDespite the well-document-ed success of our progressive\nneighbours across the Irish\nSea (commencing in March\n2002, the 15 euro cent per bag\n\u2018PlasTax\u2019 has resulted in a\n90% reduction in plastic bag\nconsumption), the UK government has made it clear\nthat it will not be following\nsuit. The line is that, as plastic bags comprise only 1% of\nour waste, such a tax would\nbe quite limited in dealing\nwith the broader issues.\nYet while it is true that\ntackling plastic bags is only\na small part of the waste\nproblem, it is an important\npart because it can make people think twice. In terms of\nchanging people\u2019s mindsets\nand instilling a sustainability\nethos, it is a great place to\nbegin. Bags may only be 1%\nof the waste stream, but they\nare a highly visible 1%.\nOf course, I hear you cry:\n\u201cwhat about my free bin\nliner?\u201d You are not alone. The\nBritish Retail Consortium,\nin their staunch opposition,\nbelieve that if such taxes\nwere introduced the demand\nfor other single use bags, like\nbin bags, would rise dramati-cally. Certainly this seems to\nbe the Irish experience. But,\nin truth, large proportions\nof plastic bags go straight\ninto the rubbish and are not\nreused in households anyway,\nand very few are returned\nto shops for reprocessing. A\nmodest sum for a bin liner\ndoes not seem like too much\nhardship to me: when we pay\nfor things we value them.\nIn the meantime, for those\nwho feel a serious bout of\n\u2018bag-guilt\u2019 coming on, get\nyour reusable calico happening and those three simple\nbut albeit difficult words, \u201cno\nbag thanks,\u201d may just be in\nreach.\n\u201c...the average is 290\nplastic bags per person\nper year\u201d\nPlastic bag overuse in the UK reaches epidemic levels\n4 trillion Number of\nall types of bags used\nworldwide annually\n17.5 billion plastic\nbags given away by\nUK supermarkets\nannually\n100,000 marine animals killed each year\ndue to plastic bags\nwww.myownbag.com\nPlastic bags: useful, but are we taking them for granted?\n\n"

This\nshould have resulted in a for-feit, but ever the gentleman,\ncaptain Shatters offered to\nplay a shortened game of 40\nminute halves.\nWhen the match finally\nkicked off, it soon became\napparent that this wasn\u2019t the\nstandard of opposition we\nwere expecting. Holloway\nwere missing some key play-ers, and despite a quiet first\n15 minutes a good win was on\nthe cards.\nThe first goal came after\nLeon ran into the box and cut\nthe ball back, leaving John\nScott with the simplest of two\nyard finishes. John however\nhad other things in mind, and\nin a moment of genius played\na pass off the crossbar into the\npath of Tom Trump. Although\nhis finish wasn\u2019t as stylish as\nthe pass to find him, Tom\nmanaged to beat the \u2018keeper\nand make it 1-0.\nThe Scott\u2019s creative play in\nfront of goal was a continued\nthreat all game, with goalkeeper and defenders always\nkept guessing as to how he\nwould avoid scoring.\nThe second goal came after\na pass back to the goalkeeper.\nThe indirect free kick was\nplayed off by Hideki for Leon\nto drill low into the corner.\nDespite some further pres-sure, Imperial failed to score\na third before half time and\nwent in 2-0 up.\nDuring the break, Shatters\nwas forced into a substitution,\nHas refusing to play on due to\nthe continual monkey noises\nbeing made by Tim and Adam.\nAlthough the sounds were not\nat all racially motivated and in\nfact part of a primitive mating\nritual between the pair, the\nsubstitution was made and\nPerry was brought on.\nThe second half started\npoorly, with the Thirds allowing Holloway to play more\nfreely and have a short spell\nof pressure. Shatters and\nCaruso were forced into\nsome last ditch tackles and\n\u2018big kicks\u2019, however this didn\u2019t\nlast long.\nPerry scored his fifth of the\nseason after some good work\nfrom Hideki. The fourth goal\ncame soon after with a nicely\nworked team move. James\nquickly rolled the ball out to\nLeon who brought it up the\nwing before playing it into\nJohn. Perry then held off his\nman before sliding a pass\nacross for Leon to slot into\nthe far corner.\nThe fifth and final goal\ncame with ten minutes to\ngo, Hideki again providing\na nicely clipped ball across\nthe box, which was firmly\ndirected home by the head\nof Adam.\nThe game finished with the\ndefence pleased to have kept\na clean sheet and protected\ngoalkeeper James from having to make a save. Despite\nthis, a better overall performance will be essential for the\nnext match, against Bucks\nChilterns.\nUnder-strength Holloway overpowered\nFOOTBALL\nImperial\u2019s third football team line up before their comfortable win over Royal Holloway last week\nby Fishface\na nicely clipped ball across Chilterns.\n\n"

We drove through\nthe town three times before\nfinally admitting we didn\u2019t\nactually know where to go\nand telephoning the lodge.\nUnfortunately, with none of us\nable to pronounce the name\nof the town, communicating\nour location proved problem-atic. Anyway, we finally found\nthe place, complete with central heating, a kitchen and\nshower, with Chillout Moods\n4 playing in the background\nand free beer! No freezing\nour arses off at the Imperial\nmountain hut this year!\nOn Saturday morning, we\nwere greeted by sunshine and\nclear blue skies and headed to\nCoed-Y-Brenin, stopping briefly in Trawsfynnyd for a bacon\nbutty after parting company\nwith Andy and his road bike.\nBy 10.30am we were hitting\nthe trails. First up, the MBR\nloop \u2013 a medium length but\naction packed route.\nWe all set off together initially but then agreed to split\ninto two groups after the initial climb gave most of us a\nrude awakening (most notably Seb on his single speed\njump bike!) The climb made\nway for an awesome single-track descent, which was just\na taste of what was to come.\nThe MBR loop is a prime\nexample of what all moun-tainbike trails should be:\nsmooth, gentle climbs with a\nmixture of fast, tight, highly\ntechnical and highly engineered descents that cry out\nto be attacked. Fantastic, but\nextremely hard on our bikes\n\u2013 and with our large group\nit wasn\u2019t long before we had\nour first breakdown, a slightly\nbuckled front wheel following a rather comical unintended off-piste excursion.\nPunctures, chain breakages\nand gear problems followed\nsoon after.\nHaving completed the MBR\nloop by lunchtime, we decided\nto do the slightly less technical but scenic Red Bull loop\nin the afternoon. Although\nless challenging from a fitness and skill point of view,\nit was every bit as enjoyable\nas the MBR loop, with the\nharsher, bumpier and rockier\ndescents providing an equally\nthrilling experience at speed,\nwith some serious air to be\nhad too. Too much air for\nsome \u2013 several members of\nthe group experienced some\nspectacular rider-over-han-dlebar crashes!\nWe got back to the log\ncabin in the evening, finding\nAndy sitting patiently in the\nwarmth, having finished his\n84 mile morning ride around\nSnowdonia hours ago. He\nrevealed he had bumped into\nsome \u201cfriendly\u201d Imperial\nmedic mountaineers, who just\nhappened to be on his route\nover Mount Snowdon, the\nhighest mountain in Wales.\nLater, we decided to go\nfor a pub dinner, only to discover that none of the local\npubs served food! Unfazed,\nwe drove to the next town\nwhere after much searching\nwe found a pub style restau-rant... and an off licence.\nSunday was another fabulous day, with not a sign of\ncloud in the sky. Andy once\nagain hit the road, whilst\nwe headed back to Coed-YBrenin. With many of us still\nsore from the first day\u2019s rid-ing, we decided we would\nsplit into two groups, with a\ncouple of us doing the epic 34\nmile Karrimor loop \u2013 a long,\nhard and really scenic route\nwinding deep into the hills\nwith the occasional highly\ntechnical singletrack section\n\u2013 whilst the others would do\nthe slightly less demanding\nSport loop, an \u2018all the fun bits\u2019\nroute.\nWith none of us able to have\nshowers, the six hour journey\nhome was an interesting one\nto say the least!

    "content": "ALBUM REVIEW\nNostalgia: ain\u2019t it wonderful? It enables old artists to come back and\nmake a killing on rose-tinted memo-ries. We have seen a deluge of old\nartists making comeback albums\nthis year, getting in on the current\nretro trend. So far we\u2019ve had Brian\nWilson of Beach Boys fame releasing his \u2018lost\u2019 album, Smile, and\nMorrissey doing the rounds with the\nrather limp You Are The Quarry.\nNow we\u2019ve got Neville Staple, lead\nsinger with classic seventies ska\nband The Specials, returning in the\nlight of renewed interest in retro\nmusic and the ska movement, with\nThe Specials\u2019 music being used in\ncar adverts and the rise of US bands\nsuch as Less Then Jake.\nBut unlike some recent come-backs, The Rude Boy Returns is\nfar from the cheeky cash-in that\nsome might expect. Instead we\nhave a collection of music that easily equals the best material The\nSpecials recorded. Much of what\u2019s\non offer here is unashamedly poppy,\nnot unlike 2-Tone disciples Madness\n\u2013 such as Since You\u2019ve Been Gone,\nand ode to enjoying the freedom\nof splitting up \u2013 but each song is\nstrengthened by the catchy, woozy\nhorns (which were a main staple of\na Specials song), and the identifiable\nska rhythms in the guitars.\nRefreshingly, there are still songs\nthat pack a social punch and make\nkeen observations. Place In Life is\na cynical look at politics and the\nlies we are told (\u201c...But if you don\u2019t\nbelieve me, then check the manifesto / Just blah blah blah and blah\nblah blah / The truth, I don\u2019t think\nso!\u201d), whilst Pressure, reminiscent\nof The Specials\u2019 Nite Klub, quickly\nmakes clear that the main character\nin the song is a heroin addict.\nSurprisingly, a slew of guests\nenhances the songs rather then\nprovides names to advertise them.\nFormer Damned drummer Rat\nScabies provides the ska beats for\nthe aforementioned Pressure, and\nthey also team up with former Clash\nguitarist Mick Jones on one of the\nstandout tracks, Do Nothing, which\nis also one of the finest examples of\nmusical craftsmanship on display.\nClocking in at over seven minutes,\nthanks to the layered sections and\ntightness of the piece, it remains\na gripping piece of revolution rock\nrather then a long winded flop.\nListening to it, you can close your\neyes and immediately transport\nyourself to south London, such is\nthe strength of the song.\nThe flow of the album is spoilt\nby some embarrassing attempts at\ndance music. A remix of Lead Belly\u2019s\nCow Cow Yicky comes across as a\ndodgy Europop theme, and an ambitious attempt at Indian ska on the\ncloser Nachna unfortunately boils\ndown to a dull, by the numbers R&B\nrecord with no personality to it.\nThese failings can\u2019t detract though\nfrom one of the surprises of the year,\na comeback album that packs as\nmuch punch as one from today\u2019s\nyoung whippersnappers, and without the hype machine spoiling it.\nConsider it an essential for ska fans,\nold and new alike.\nMatthew Hartfield\nOld frontmen never die\nThe Specials\u2019 frontman brings us his new record, complete with obligatory star guests,\nwhile Reuben give away their last couple of singles for free\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 25 November 2004\n16\nNeville Staple\nThe Rude Boy Returns\nRude Boy Music\nHHHHI\nMusic music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nNeville Staple: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me, officer, it was them!\u201d\nSINGLE REVIEW\nEveryone\u2019s felt it \u2013 that teenage\nangst that makes you slam doors\nand throw things at the wall. Most\npeople grow out of it, but some manage to make a career out of it.\nReuben are a strange mix of those\nbland, radio-friendly guitar bands\nthat have sprung up everywhere, the\ngrowling misery of a nu-metal band,\nand the chirpy self-destructiveness\nof Lit without the chirpiness. With\nrelentlessly driving guitars, monotonously intoned vocals and ever-present but strangely unobtrusive\nrage, they\u2019ve got a formula that will\npropel them to temporary fame as\nthis year\u2019s hottest band \u2013 and indeed\nis in the process of doing so.\nTheir lyrics deal with arguments\nand misunderstandings, full of a low-lying lethargic depression that could\ngo either way, into suicidal grimness\nor homicidal madness, and provides\nthe most fascinating facet of this\ntwo-song album sampler. Catchy but\nnot particularly memorable, interesting without displaying an awful\nlot to be interested in, Reuben play\nsimplified, gimmick-free rock, and\ndo it well but without sparkle. You\u2019ll\nprobably like them. Just not with\nany kind of passion.\nAnna Novitzky\nReuben\nLets Stop Hanging Out /\nStuck In My Throat\nXtra Mile\nHHHII\nLIVE REVIEW\nIn retrospect, it may have been a\nlittle foolhardy to hold the second\nRockSoc band night of the term on\nthe day after bonfire night. Torn\nbetween the twin temptations of an\nevening of live rock music and the\nmany spectacular fireworks displays\non offer in our fair capital, many\npeople seemed to have gone for\nthe explosions and pretty colours;\ntruly, it was a tough choice. Still,\nthe bands were willing despite the\nsparse crowd, and those who made\nthe effort got their money\u2019s worth.\nDespite a shaky start \u2013 nerves\nseeming to get the better of them\nat times \u2013 Imperial\u2019s very own Jazz\nand Rock Society band, The Phly,\ndelivered an enjoyable set. Laid\nback and jazzy, they played simple\nbut effective rock that brought to\nmind the White Stripes without the\ngimmicks. With beefy, murky nuances and female vocals that were rich\nand strong once they got going,\nthere was more than a hint of delta\nblues. Although it began to drag\ntowards the end and the audience\nremained resolutely unmoved by\nall enthusiastic overhead clapping\nand soulful kneeling down, we can\nlook forward to good things from\nThe Phly. Once they get themselves\nsome confidence.\nOnly Joe were of the ripped-jeans-and-messy-hair school of bouncy\npunk that isn\u2019t always quite as\nwacky as it thinks it is. Displaying\noutlandish instruments from turntables to a clarinet, they sounded like\na fuzzy and uncoordinated version of\nMadness, perky but inefficient and\nslightly confused. Entertainment\nvalue was gained by the untimely\ndeath of the bass guitar \u2013 leading to\na brief instrumental interlude while\nanother was procured from the next\nband \u2013 but their seeming inability to\nsing in tune with each other dragged\nit all back down. Full marks for the\nhome-made banner, though.\nThe pattern of random destruction was continued when part of\nthe PA system exploded during Gin\nPanic\u2019s set, but they rose above it\nadmirably. Purveying funky, purebred rock music, like the Red Hot\nChili Peppers only harder and without the stupid noises, they were\ntight, smooth and exciting. Complete\nwith crazy, standing-on-the-drum\nkit antics, they managed to combine spacey, prog-like melodies and\nnasal, Muse-esque vocals into a surprising mix that really rather rocked\nout. They were interesting, engaging and as hard to describe as they\nwere to ignore.\nVictims of Noise are aiming for\nthe stars, but they do fall a bit\nshort for now. They worked hard\n\u2013 and indeed played hard \u2013 but it\nall seemed rather forced at times.\nRock tinged with punk, they relied\non fast riffs and loud shouting along\nwith manic pogoing and semi-nudity.\nIt was all danceable enough, in a\nRage Against The Machine sort of\nway, but they came across as the\nsort of band who get their postures\nand poses all sorted out before they\nstart on the music. All completely\ninoffensive and likeable, but lacking\nin any real substance.\nSo, the bands ranged in quality but\na generally good time was had by\nall. A cheap, cheerful opportunity to\nexperience live music in your very\nown students\u2019 union. Next month,\nif there aren\u2019t any fireworks, you\nshould come along.\nAnna Novitzky\nRockSoc Gig Night\ndBs\nHHHHI\nVictims Of Noise: serious, hairy, and apparently pretty good\n\n"

    "content": "Some of you may be rather sceptical about the sixth instalment from\nPixar Studios. The past five offer-ings, the Toy Story movies, A Bug\u2019s\nLife, Monsters Inc and Finding\nNemo have all had similar formulae.\nThe Incredibles has something else\nto offer though, another dimension\nto it.\nIt was a big gamble on Pixar\u2019s\npart to bring in former Simpsons\ndirector Brad Bird. This is the first\nsubmission from Pixar that has used\nonly \u2018human\u2019 characters and breaks\nthe mould of mismatched buddies\nand road trip formula. Pixar cannot\nseem to put a foot wrong though.\nOnce again, they have created a\nvisual marvel, laced with intelligent\nhumour that should, and will, appeal\nto the masses.\nThe Incredibles tells the story of\nMr Incredible, aka Bob Parr (Craig\nT Nelson), who is one of many super-heroes. That is until Mr Incredible\ncatches a suicidal jumper who is\nless than grateful, leading to a wave\nof lawsuits and legal compensations that make superheroes unwel-come. The Government is forced\nto intervene and run a Superhero\nRelocation Program, so that they\ncan all lead normal and anonymous\nlives. They become another face in\nthe crowd.\nSeveral years down the line,\nBob and Helen, formerly Elastigirl\n(Holly Hunter), live in suburbia hell\nraising three children: Dash (who\ncan run at the speed of light), Violet\n(who can turn invisible and form\nforce fields) and Jack Jack (not even\npotty trained), while trying to fit to\nthe norm.\nAll is not what it seems though.\nBob is desperately unhappy is his\nmediocre and immoral monkey-suit\njob, unable to help anyone without\nhis bureaucratic pen-pushing boss\nbreathing down his neck. Dash is\nitching to use his gifts in a competitive nature. Violet is depressed,\nfinding it hard to find her place in\nhigh school and feels, quite literally,\nlike the invisible girl. Meanwhile,\nHelen is stressed, working hard to\nkeep her family constrained to normality and trying to keep her husband in check from returning to his\nold lifestyle.\nOne day, out of the blue, Mr\nIncredible receives a mysterious\ncall, offering the chance to play the\ngood guy again...\nThe Incredibles is another example of Pixar\u2019s mastery of popular\nanimation. This is family entertainment at its best. However, it does\nseem to lack the innocence of Toy\nStory or Monsters Inc and isn\u2019t as\nmagical as Finding Nemo. This is\nprobably because it is a story about\nhuman beings (of sorts) who do\nhave a loose connection with this\nreality.\nThe heroes themselves aren\u2019t\nhighly original. Frozone (Samuel L\nJackson) is the most obvious reference (Iceman). There are links to\nThe Fantastic Four, The Flash and\nCaptain America. There are also\nreferences to James Bond movies,\nwith the island hideout of the villain\nSyndrome (Jason Lee) synonymous\nwith various Bond baddies. Edna\n(Brad Bird) is also a reference to Q\nand Syndrome to Dr No.\nThe comedy is intelligent; some of\nyou maybe surprised at how smart\nthis movie is. In particular, The\nIncredibles answers the age-old\nquestion of \u2018cape or no cape?\u2019 with\nan amusing monologue from Edna\nabout how dangerous capes really\nare. The script is well written and\ndelivered. The voice casting is adequate but not \u2018incredible\u2019. Frozone\nis the best cast out of all of them.\nPerhaps some bigger names would\nhave added nicely to a movie that\nhas visual appeal and intelligence.\nThe running time is rather long,\nwith some parts of the film slightly\ndragging, though not peripheral, as\nthe background history is needed\nto understand each characters tor-ment.\nThe visuals really are breathtaking at times, in particular the\ndetailed fluids and dazzling light.\nThe sheen and textures are simply\nastounding.\nThe Incredibles is a different offering from Pixar. It is markedly more\nmature in tone and approach, and\nshould be highly enjoyable for all\ngenerations, male and female.\nAlan Ng\nFilm Editor\nIncredibly good fun\nThe Incredibles\nDirector: Brad Bird\nStarring: Craig T Nelson, Holly Hunter,\nSamuel L Jackson, Jason Lee\nLength: 121 minutes\nCertificate: U\nReleased: November 26\nHHHHH\nFilm film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nA different kind of family vacation\nWho will walk away? Perhaps our reviewer should have\nDiamonds are a girl\u2019s best friend,\nand they most definitely are Pierce\nBrosnan\u2019s. A diamond master thief,\nMax Burdett (Brosnan) has never\nbeen caught. He has the best moves\nand the best alibis. His girlfriend\nLola Cirillo (Salma Hayek) is his\naccomplice in disguise. With only\none of the Napoleon diamonds left\nto be stolen, the couple retire to the\nBahamas where they can have any-thing. They are multimillionaires\nafter all.\nAn ocean liner has docked on the\nBahamas displaying the diamond\ncruise and the third Napoleon dia-mond, the only diamond the two\nmaster thieves have allegedly not\nstolen. Was this his plan all along?\nWas this the set up for his next scam?\nWill he achieve his last big score or\ncontinue with boredom in restless\nretirement? Not only that, but Max\nis being followed by FBI agent Stan\nLloyd (Woody Harrelson). Max has\nfooled Stan too many times, and he\nwon\u2019t be tricked again.\nAfter The Sunset is slicker than\nother caper comedies such as\nOceans Eleven; you would have to\nexpect that with Pearce Brosnan\nbeing cast as the lead. This James\nBond superstar carries all the style\nthe film needs. He is the perfect diamond thief \u2013 like him, they show that\nelement of sophistication. Diamonds\nare an upper class to normal thiev-ing.\nThe film is worth watching just for\nSalma Hayek\u2019s amazing body, which\nis shown off in tiny little bikinis for\na large proportion of the film\u2019s running time. It looks a lot better than\nin her days as Frida.\nHowever, if Brosnan wants to walk\naround with his shirt unbuttoned\nto try and compete with Hayek, I\nsuggest he goes to the gym or just\nbuttons it back up again.\nDirectorBrettRatner(RushHour)\nhas a great eye and the film scenes\nwere a lot of fun to look at. However,\nit seemed like some scenes were\nmissing. Stan Lloyd fell into the\nhands of a local cop (Naomie Harris)\nwho seemed to be against him from\nthe moment he appeared and paid\nhim no attention whatsoever. Then\nsuddenly she was in love with him.\nDid I miss something there?\nThe story line is fun and enter-taining; all the characters were well\ncast and likable. Woody Harrison\u2019s\ngoofy comedy humour clicks with\nBrosnan\u2019s persona in a strange but\nexcellent way. When the two are on\nscreen together they provide all the\nlaughs of the film.\nThe film was effortless for Pierce\nBrosnan, on a Caribbean Island with\nSalma Hayek all over him, and it\nshowed as he simply fell into the\nrole. Salema Hayek seemed to be in\nthe film for a jolt of sex appeal and\nlittle else. They must have had fun\nfilming the scenes; there were lots\nof funny moments.\nAfter The Sunset is forgettable\nentertainment.

But what does it mean,\nif anything?\nIs trance really the dominant\nforce in the global music industry,\ndo the trance mafia actually have\nthat much influence in clubland, is\ntechno dead, do people still actually like prog, does anyone stand a\nchance of knocking the big T off his\ntop spot anytime soon, what the hell\nis dance music anyway, does anyone\ncare any more and is it possible to\nbe a drug addled OAP non-DJ and\nstill be considered one of the top ten\nbest DJs in the world?\nIf your perspective on the dance\nmusic industry comes from this\nannual poll, then the answers are\nyes, yes, yes, mystifyingly so, no,\n*shrug*, it seems so and only in\nAmerica.\nBut how true to real life is it if\nwe assume for a second that the\ndance industry just about resides\non the verges of \u2018real life\u2019? In fact,\nit\u2019s not that far from the truth, you\njust have to be aware that we get a\nseverely distorted view of the world\nover here in Blighty, and much more\nso in London.\nOn a global scale, trance is huge.\nForget England for a second and\nyou have Australia, the US, Holland\nand Uruguay (no, seriously) at least,\nwhere trance is as big as it has\never been anywhere, not to mention\nthe seemingly neverending appeal\nof Ibiza. Beyond that, techno will\nnever die, it can\u2019t. It is such a catchall statement and covers so many\nvaried styles of music that it is constantly evolving and will never be\nthe same from one week to the next.\nLikewise house and all its connota-tions, even prog.\nBut my issue is not with the genres represented, but the actual DJs.\nThe top ten has been astonishingly\nstatic for the last three years that\nI can remember; there were only\ntwo new entries this year and only\nanother three in the following ten.\nIs dance music really this static and\npredictable, or is it our tastes that\ndon\u2019t change?\nPersonally, I take a much more\ncynical view. The whole list is a\ngreat big popularity contest, fairly\nunquestionably, and much like Union\nelections the winners are decided\nessentially by who has the most\nfriends. But no DJ has that many\n\u2018friends\u2019, so they influence people in\nother more subtle ways, by having\nmany radio shows, both internet and\nreal, getting unsuspecting mangled\nmembers of the public to sign up to\ntheir mailing lists and then sending them emails that subconsciously\nmake them want to vote in the DJ\npoll, and by playing gigs to excessively large numbers of people, like\nthe Olympics.\nIt\u2019s all part of the game of course,\nand being at the top enables you to\nget the big gigs and the radio shows,\nbut once you\u2019re there, is it then just\na matter of who has the best PR\npeople and do the top dogs then just\nrest on their laurels and trade on\nthe title? Is the value of the poll any\nless because of it? And will it ever\nswing in favour of the \u2018better\u2019 DJs\nrather then the more popular ones?\nInevitably, the answer is a despondent no.\nBut should we be grateful that\nmore people than ever are vot-ing, and that more people seem\nto care now than before? Even if\nPaul Oakenfold can get in the top\nten, having publicly declared himself finished with dance music and\nhardly played a single gig all year,\nshouldn\u2019t we just be pleased that\npeople still care enough to vote in\ntheir tens of thousands? Because\nisn\u2019t it only through public shows\nof unity like this that young talent\ncomes onto the scene and forces\nthe bigger names to take the extra\nsteps forward and move up a gear, to\npush the boundaries of our art and\nimprove life for everyone?\nWell, yes. It takes time, but yes. So\nin the meantime I suppose we will\njust have to make do with the back-slapping and vacuous popularity\ncontests, however shallow they may\nseem on the surface \u2013 a forced grin\nand bitten tongue is a small price to\npay. I still think Paul van Dyk should\nhave won though.\nDominic Farrell\nHundreds and thousands\nA couple of weeks ago we printed the results of DJ Mag\u2019s Top 100 DJs poll.\nThe legendary Mr Farrell passes comment...\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 25 November 2004\n18\nNightlife clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\nOakenfold: Plays in America lots\nThinking of working for us?\nSee if we work for you.\nOutstanding people fit in at CSFB.

As a result, almost \u00a37bn\nof stock value in the industry was blown and the equity\nmarket receded to a value of\njust 4805 after it\u2019s recent peak\nfollowing George W Bush\u2019s\nre-election.\nThe FTSE 100 also declined\nbut still remained above the\nlandmark 4760 level. The\nfive perpetrating drugs, all\nof which face the remote\npossibility of gradual withdrawal from the markets,\nare Vioxx, Crestor, Accutane,\nSerevent and an unnamed\ncancer drug made by Roche\nHoldings. However, the FDA\nhas been reluctant to back Dr\nGraham\u2019s claims absolutely,\nhaving previously dragged\nits feet in a similar situation\nwhen claims were made that\nanti-depressants could be\ndangerous if taken by youths\nregularly.\nVioxx, a drug claiming to\nsoothe the effects of arthri-tis, was the trigger for Dr\nGraham\u2019s enquiry into the\npharmaceutical industry as\na whole. The maker of Vioxx,\nMerck Plc, initially denied the\naccusation that 28,000 heart\nattacks and deaths were\ncaused by the drug.\nCrestor, one of the drugs\nat the centre of the investigation and an effective anti-cholesterol drug, is forecast\nto account for 22% of the\nearnings of AstraZeneca by\n2008. This, of course, had an\nimmediate impact on Astra\u2019s\nshares, which were down\n222p at \u00a321.45, and futures\nderivatives. The \u00a33.7bn loss\nin share value was the highest of the sector, with the\nfall estimated at almost 10%.\nWhat makes this particularly\nworrying to Astra executives\nis the dependence they have\non Crestor\u2019s contribution to\nrevenues, an estimated $1bn\nin 2004 alone.\nDr Graham considered the\ndrug risky and urged the\nFDA to probe further into it\u2019s\nchemical make-up and effects\nafter he highlighted the\npotential of Crestor to cause\nmuscle and kidney damage.\nTo ensure a total annihilation\nof the drug, Europe\u2019s health\nand drug regulators initiated\na review of Crestor\u2019s recommended dosage.\nSerevent is currently used\nby a minority of asthma sufferers worldwide, but its effects\non blood pressure caused\nGlaxoSmithKline\u2019s 4% drop\nin share price. Despite the\nfact that Serevent accounts\nfor under 1% of Glaxo\u2019s sales,\n\u00a32.8bn of Glaxo stocks lost\nvalue last week. This was\nattributed in part to charges\nbeing filed by... you guessed\nit... Eliot Spitzer (see last\nweek\u2019s Business section).\nHaving increased his net to\nthe pharmaceuticals indus-try, the New York Attorney\nGeneral filed charges against\nGlaxo for its reluctance to\nreveal data from trials that\nindicated an increased\nchance of suicidal behaviour\namong children taking one of\nits flagship drugs, Paxil.\nAccutane, as well as\nPfizer\u2019s Bextra and Abbott\nLaboratories\u2019 Meridia, were\nalso suspected of causing\nserious after-effects. The\nmanufacturer of Accutane,\nRoche Phamaceuticals Ltd,\ncategorically denied the possibility of psychosis, a disease that raises thoughts\nof suicide, being an effect\nof Accutance. However, the\nmarket showed no mercy as\nit steamed across the whole\nboard of pharmaceuticals,\nripping down the peak stock\nprices of all the manufactur-ers.\nAnother drug has also\nbeen hitting the headlines\nrecently, but with a more\nsinister underlying purpose.\nAfghanistan is leading the\nwar for narcotics, it seems,\nafter the country\u2019s output of\nopium shadowed the minimal\namounts produced in Africa\nor Eastern Europe.\nOne in ten Afghans are\ninvolved in this lucrative\ntrade, which is actually one of\nthe main sources (60%) of the\ncountry\u2019s GDP\n. According to\nthe UN Office on Drugs and\nCrime, Afghanistan has over\n130,000 hectares of poppies.\nOpium trade in Afghanistan\nceased during the US war\non the Taliban and has only\nrecently started generating\nrevenue for the country. The\ncultivation of opium and its\nsubsequent benefits to the\ncountry is deceptively fruit-ful; many are now questioning the usefulness of ousting\nthe Taliban if the conditions\nfor terrorism are reappear-ing.\nThree years on, Afghanistan\nis assessing if the benefits of\nthe opium trade outweigh the\nrisk of a new Taliban. Though\nmuch of their income is from\nforeign aid, Afghanistan\nstill relies heavily on opium\nharvesting to fund infra-structure, development and\neducation. However, this is\nexactly where the dilemma\nfor Afghanistan comes in:\nif more warlords enter and\nrule the country, the development of Afghanistan and the\ndemocracy that the West has\nbeen trying to achieve will be\nlost yet again.\nInhalers: notorious sources of Serevent, a drug now found to mildly inhibit average blood pressure\nLatest\nfrom the\nSquare\nMile\nDrKW stays\nDrKW, the investment banking arm of Dresdner Bank\nAG, a subsidiary of the Allianz\nGroup, reported operating\nprofits of 162m euros in the\nsix months ending in June.\nAlthough down 40%, and having been approached by three\ninterested parties, the Allianz\nGroup does not intend to sell\nDrKW for a cash injection but\nis looking for a partner to\nalign its strategy correctly\nwith the industry.\nAsset-backed bonds\nNew issues in Asset Backed\nSecurities have risen significantly as a result of increased\nconsumer spending power\nand eager lenders. The\n$660bn issuance, of which\nABB\u2019s accounts for $430bn, is\nincreasingly worrying to the\nFed as it reveals the depth to\nwhich the average US consumer is in debt.\nChaudhry\u2019s ratings\nA new credit ratings agency\nintroduced earlier this week\nhas changed its position on\nAstraZenica from hold to buy.\nAlthough Astra has been hit\nhard by Dr Graham\u2019s findings\n(see main article), I changed\nthe rating because of the\nincreased drug trade from\nAfghanistan. An increase in\nheroin in the economy implies\na surge in drug abuse and\nhence in medical services.\nSince the medical services\nuse pharmaceutical companies as their primary source\nof medical, you can expect\nAstra\u2019s sales to rise and so\nwill their share price!\n\n"

Shatters\u2019\ndream was now being played\nout by a team of highly talented performers.\nThe newest opponents\nto stand up to the Thirds\nwere London Metropolitan\nSeconds. Although they had\nlost a couple of games in our\nBUSA group, we knew this\nwasn\u2019t going to be an easy\nride.\nThere was barely a hair\u2019s\nbreadth between the teams in\nfirst 20 minutes. The Imperial\nmidfield looked strong with\nJohn and Has battling like\nwarriors and Adam showing\ntouches of unparalleled maj-esty. Eventually the break we\nneeded came when Caruso\nwith his huge thighs played\nthe ball to John who delightfully clipped it into the right\nhand channel for Leon to run\nonto. Leon\u2019s low hard cross\nfound the ever willing runner\nJohn three yards out to score\nwith an easy finish.\nThe two flying wingers\nHideki and Leon were causing the Met defence all sorts\nof problems and the spearhead of the attack, John Scott,\nwas as strong as ever holding\nthe ball up and bringing others into play. He did, how-ever, miss a sitter from one\nyard out after Leon had again\nprobed their defence before\ncrashing a shot against the\ncross-bar. Luckily for John\nhe was called offside so his\nblushes were saved.\nThe second half started with\nearly pressure from London\nMet, but Imperial soon took\ncontrol of the game with triangles applenty in midfield,\nwith full backs Jan and Tom\nwanting some of the sexy\nfootballing action. Caruso\nwas solid at the back, James\nlooked like a king amongst\nmen in goal with awesome\ndominance of his area, and\nShatters was just handballing\nat every opportunity, although\nhe too was awesome.\nThe second goal came after\na foul on Caruso during the\nm\u00eal\u00e9e at a corner brought a\npenalty. Ever the gentleman,\nAdam let Hideki calmly roll\nthe ball into the bottom corner for two-nil.\nA substitution brought off\nJohn and on came Perry to\ncause their tiring defence\neven more problems. A big\nkick from the superb James\nwas killed dead by Perry\nbefore a mazy run flummoxed\ntheir defender. He then curled\nthe ball into the far corner to\nmake it 3-0.\nAll in all this was a fantastic\nday for the thirds who could\nnow go out and celebrate on\nthe Hammy Ten pub crawl.\nCarnage.\nSexy football\nFOOTBALL\nFirsts hold off\nGeorge\u2019s for victory\nSponsored by\nSt George\u2019s\nWomen\u2019s 2nd 38\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 40\nBy Erika Kennington\nAnother Monday, another\nmatch for the Firsts. But\nunlike our first two ULU\nmatches of this season (where\nwe have been thrashed by the\ntop two sides in our league)\nwe had a genuine chance of\nscoring our first points.\nOur opponents were St\nGeorges Seconds, who we\nnarrowly beat by four goals\nlast season, and we were\ndetermined to not give them\ntheir revenge.\nHaving had an extra training session against a local\nteam, we were feeling quietly confident. We got off to\nthe best start possible in the\nfirst quarter, with textbook\nmoves and well rehearsed\nplay quickly translating into\na six goal lead. George\u2019s were\nliterally left standing as we\nplayed some near-perfect\nnetball.\nUnfortunately this couldn\u2019t\nlast, and their quarter-time\nteam talk resulted in some\nvery harsh tactics \u2013 double\nmarking BOTH our shooters,\nso that the slightest movement (even to adjust a skirt),\nled to a \u2018contact\u2019 and a free\npass to their team. Still, we\ndidn\u2019t let this get to us, kept\nthe defence tight, and held\nthem to a draw in the second\nquarter, keeping our six goal\nlead intact.\nFor some unknown reason,\ndouble marking tactics were\ndropped in the third quarter\n(hey \u2013 we\u2019re not complain-ing), allowing us to play our\nown game, take control and\ndouble our lead. There was\nawesome shooting, beautiful interceptions, and some\namazing set-pieces from the\nwhole team \u2013 it was just a\nshame we had no audience to\nappreciate it!\nSo with a 12 goal lead, we\nknew the match was ours\nfor the taking in the last\nquarter, but we also knew\nthat we couldn\u2019t afford to\nbe too confident (for those\nof you not familiar with the\ngame, a ten goal deficit can\nquickly be made up in about\nfive minutes, and unfortunately a quarter is 15 minutes\nlong!)\nSadly, Georges also realised\nthis and set about like a team\npossessed. I\u2019m ashamed to\nsay that we nearly cracked!\nAs the minutes counted\ndown, so did our lead. Doublemarking returned, we lost our\nrhythm, and George\u2019s picked\nup on every single mistake\nwe made, punishing it with\nsome flawless shooting.\nWith our lead down to two\ngoals, we finally decided to\ndo something about it, and\neventually got the ball moving up the court once more.\nSome great shooting under\npressure form Sam and Jen\nensured that we hung onto\nour three points as the final\nwhistle went.\nAlthough everyone played\nwell, special mention must go\nto JJ, newly promoted from\nthe Seconds and voted man\nof the match in her first game\nwith us. Finally I\u2019d like to say\na huge well done to the whole\nteam \u2013 we did it!\nNETBALL\nSponsored by\nChichester Men\u2019s 1st 14\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 39\nBy David Jackson\nThe long sleepy journey\nto the south coast left the\nImperial Men\u2019s First XV feeling a little jaded, however the\nmetaphorical cobwebs were\nsoon shaken off as they faced\noff against the tyrannical\nhorde of University College\nChichester (UCC).\nWithin the first few min-utes, Imperial had made\ntheir intentions known, as the\nenigma that is Jon Spencer\nglided through a hapless\ndefence following a well\nrehearsed line-out. Secondly,\nSimple Simon Smith skilfully\nscampered, scoring superbly.\nMinutes later he doubled his\ntally, showing incisive rapidity\nand 20:20 peripheral vision.\nUCC\u2019sonlyreplieswerepenalties. A dark cloud descended\nhowever, as Marcus Wills was\nthe recipient of a yellow card;\nshamefully he trudged from\nthe arena a broken dejected\nman. Good defence from\nImperial kept the half time\nscore at 25-9.\nWithout speaking hyperboli-cally, insufficient superlatives\nexist to describe Imperial\u2019s\nsecond half performance. The\n\u2018angelic\u2019 Gabriel rounded off\na superb move where Andrew\nTowers et al showed intense\npace, intelligent hands and\nintegrity in the face of adver-sity.\nRaphael added his brush\nstrokes of genius to the\nImperial canvas and demonstrated his full palette of\nskills, evading tackles from\nthe UCC forwards and scoring two tries.\nSpencer\u2019s metronomic boot\nwas on song, converting 83.3%\nof tries. Other noteworthy performances came from Alex\nO\u2019Rourke, Rich Aung, and the\nomnipresent Achi, captain\nfor the first time.

Congratulations to JJ for\nbeing voted woman of the\nmatch for the second time.\nNETBALL\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 7\nQueen Mary\nWomen\u2019s 1st 3\nBy Alex McCredie\nOn a cold and wet Sunday\nmorning, the Imperial ladies\u2019\nfootball team came out for an\nexciting match against their\nold rivals Queen Mary.\nWithin eight minutes of\nkick off, Queen Mary scored,\nputting Imperial into attacking mode after it was evident\nthat they could do better. The\ndefence swiftly put the ball\nup and Morwena in midfield\ntook it dashing in from the\nleft and neatly curled an\nequaliser from outside the\nbox straight into the net.\nQueen Mary hadn\u2019t given\nup just yet and stunningly\nscored ten minutes later,\nputting them 2-1 up. Imperial\nwere not to be outdone when\nthe club captain, Kathy, came\nstorming through with the\nball down the middle and\nknocked the ball just over\nthe posts. Jessica, the newest import from the Orange\nCounty, California skilfully\ntook the ball out of midfield,\ndodged through their raging\ndefence and shot at an amazingly acute angle to hit the\ncrossbar. Seconds later she\ndid it again and it went in.\nThe Imperial defence\nworked very hard to clear\nthe ball after it was back with\nQueen Mary. Maew headed\nthe ball out, it was brought\nback in and then speedy\nGuilles got there first and\ncleared it over Queen Mary\nupfield. Aysha received it at\nthe halfway line, outpaced all\nof the defence and nipped\nit in the bottom right-hand\ncorner. With two minutes\nto go until half time, incredibly there was time for a\nfourth for Imperial. Aysha\nand Poppy had control of the\nball, skimming it past defend-ers. Aysha scored 30 seconds\nbefore the whistle.\nImperial\u2019s spirits were\nup and Aysha ran with the\nball straight down the middle and passed to Poppy who\nsmashed one in 15 minutes\nbefore the end. Queen Mary\nwere still trying, but Alex,\nGuilles and Kath blocked\ntheir way. Rim, the goalie,\nwith her cool head, smartly\npicked up a few stray balls.\nFive minutes before the end\nImperial knew that they\nwere safe, juggling the ball\nbetween themselves. The\ndefence pushed up, Maew\nballooned a high one up-front\nand Aysha scored a drop goal\nto complete her hat-trick and\nsecure the Imperial ladies\u2019\n7-3 victory.\nAlthough everyone on the\nImperial team made a strong\ncontribution, the \u2018dame of\nthe game\u2019 was Morwena\nMarshall for scoring her first\ngoal for Imperial after years\nas an amazing defender.\nFootball ladies secure victory\nFOOTBALL\nSend your sports reports to sport.felix@ic.ac.uk,\nwith photographs if possible!\n\n"

There\u2019s not\nreally much that the police, or any-one, have been able to do recently.\nAll we can do is ensure that students\nare aware of the dangers \u2013 which\nFelix is doing.\nThere\u2019s something else that\ndoesn\u2019t seem to change on the news\npages this week \u2013 but which ostensibly can: departments timetabling\nlectures when they shouldn\u2019t.\nTwo years ago, my predecessor\ntook a proposal to the Senate (the\nCollege\u2019s academic governing body)\nrequesting that Freshers Week be\nextended to become a full week\n(those of you who are not first years\nwill remember that teaching has\ntraditionally started on the first\nWednesday of the autumn term).\nThe Senate had a \u2018lively discussion\u2019 and failed to agree on anything\nother than that the issue should be\nlooked at.\nLast year, my first as Union\nPresident, I successfully persuaded the Senate to only allow non-assessed induction lessons in the\nfirst week \u2013 and then only from\nWednesday so as to give a bit more\nbreathing space \u2013 and to make\nthe Freshers Fair a full day event.\nEven then it took the third attempt,\nand much preparatory work with\nthe Academic Registrar, to get it\nthrough. Of course, the academics\ncomplained and some departments\n(notably undergraduate medicine)\ndidn\u2019t quite follow the rules, as they\nwere traumatised by the prospect\nof having to redo their timetables.\nNevertheless, the principle was universally accepted and appropriate\ntimetabling changes are being made\nfor next year to make it universal\nacross College.\nSome 20 years ago, the Union\nPresident of the day successfully\nlobbied the Senate to keep lunchtimes free. Under College policy,\nthere should be no teaching between\n12 noon and 2pm on any weekday.\nAnd there should be no teaching\nafter 12.30pm on Wednesdays (the\nextra 30 minutes being to allow for\nfinishing labs etc).\nWhy did the Senate set aside this\ntime? Because university is about\nmore than just studying for your\ndegree \u2013 lunchtimes and Wednesday\nafternoons are set aside to pursue\nthose other activities. So you\u2019ve\ngo no excuse not to participate in\nthe diverse pursuits offered by the\nUnion\u2019s clubs and societies.\nLunchtimes are not only used by\nthe Union but also by the humanities\nprogramme. At Imperial, everyone\ncan study a humanities course or\nlearn a language. Uniquely amongst\nscience teaching universities, undergraduates here have a rich \u2018for credit\u2019 humanities programme they can\nengage in to broaden their learning.\nSure we all came here to do \u2018proper\u2019\ndegrees, but a little social science\nevery now and then is good for the\nsoul. Visit www.hu.ic.ac.uk to find\nout what\u2019s on offer.\nSo why do some departments still\nschedule teaching at lunchtimes\nor Wednesday afternoons? Mainly\nbecause they haven\u2019t been told off as\nno students have complained. And\nthat\u2019s why it\u2019s important that you do.\nThere are plenty of ways to improve\nlife at College (the Union\u2019s strategic\nreview and QAA audit survey being\nexamples), but at the end of the day\nwe can only do our job if you actively\ntell us what affects you, rather than\njust assuming that we know.\nMUSTAFA ARIF\nUNION PRESIDENT\nSTATE OF\nTHE UNION\n2004 to 2008\nSurvey\nFor those of you who haven\u2019t filled\nout the survey at www.union.ic.ac.\nuk/survey yet \u2013 why not? There are\nonly a few days left to fill out the\nonline student survey for planning\nthe Union\u2019s future.\nYou\u2019ll have received an email from\nthe about this on Tuesday, explaining that the Union is undergoing\na Strategic Review \u2013 the biggest\nreview ever undertaken of what the\nUnion offers and how it can develop\nin the years ahead, ensuring that\nyour Union offers the best service\nto you.\nYou have a real chance to\nshape the future of the Union\nThe Union is entering a huge\nperiod of review to ensure that we\nknow what our members want.\nIn the past we have invested in\ncertain areas, but have never had\nan overall plan of where we are\ngoing and how we can improve\nand develop for the good of our\nmembers.\nNot to be taken lightly\nSo yes, it might be a hassle to fill\nout the survey, but this is an excellent opportunity. It is not a small\nscale scheme \u2013 we\u2019re dedicating a\nlot of time and energy into making\nsure your voice is heard. It\u2019s a very\nserious issue and we need your honest answers. So do have your say\nand contribute to the future of your\nUnion.\nClubs and societies\nEach Chair/President of a club or\nsociety has been sent a Clubs &\nSocieties questionnaire. Please\nreturn these as soon as possible and\nconsult your committees and members so that we can get as much\ninformation as possible to improve\nthis large area of the Union\u2019s activi-ties.\nBribery\nAnd if that\u2019s not enough, then we\u2019ll\nresort to bribery \u2013 all students who\ncomplete the online survey will be\nput into a draw to receive a number\nof prizes. These include a Sony\nPlaystation, travel vouchers from\nSTA Travel, a meal for two at Moti\nMahal restaurant and some beer.\nImperial College Union is here for\nyou, but this can only work if you\u2019re\nthere for us.\nAnd finally\nYou\u2019ll notice towards the end of\nthe survey there are questions\nrelating to QAA (Quality Assurance\nAgency). The Union is writing a\nstatement on behalf of our students\nto go the QAA and this is an important part of their audit of Imperial\nCollege. This is a process that the\nCollege is taking seriously, so to\nallow us to represent your views,\ncomplete the survey.

Of the\n18,500 photographs entered\nfor the 2004 competition, his\nwas deemed the most striking and memorable by the\njudges, and scooped the most\nprestigious award in wildlife\nphotography.\nThe photograph was taken\noff the east coast of South\nAfrica, on the Transkei \u2018Wild\nCoast\u2019 during the annual sardine run. Initially herded to\nthe surface by a pod of dol-phins, this baitball of sardines\ncame under attack from gan-nets, tuna and sharks. Perrine\nwas in the right place at the\nright time to get the shot, but\nadmitted he was bumped by\nthe 3.5m long sharks in the\nprocess.\nHe told Felix: \u201cIt was potentially dangerous \u2013 you have\nto think about the situation\nin advance and have strategies for the various things\nthat could happen. The year\nbefore I took that picture,\nanother photographer was\nbadly bitten by a feeding\nshark and nearly lost his arm.\nIt was an accident, not really\nthe shark\u2019s fault, but not a\ngood situation in a remote\nsite... He was very, very lucky\nto pull through.\u201d\nPerrine\u2019s photograph, along\nwith other images from this\nyear\u2019s competition, is currently on display in an exhibition at the Natural History\nMuseum, near Imperial\u2019s\nSouth Kensington campus.\nAs with previous years, the\nstandard of photography is\noutstanding, and the exhibition contains all the category\nwinning images, runners-up\nandcommendedphotographs.\nIn total, 60 images have been\nenlarged and lit up, and will\nbe on display until February,\nwhen they will begin a tour\nof the UK.\nThis year\u2019s competition has\na real underwater feel to it\nand unlike other years, there\nare more sharks than big cats\non display in the exhibition.\nDoug Perrine has a second\nphotograph on display \u2013 again\na bronze whaler feeding on\na baitball. The innovation\naward went to Pete Atkinson\nwith a clever photo of a grey\nreef shark just below the surface of the water, and a great\nwhite shark shot is highly\ncommended in the portrait\ncategory. Yet the exhibition\nhas something for everyone \u2013\nwhether it is sharks, chimps,\nsnakes, fungi, flowers, spectacular landscapes or the\nNorthern lights, the range of\nimages is possibly the most\ndiverse in the competition\u2019s\nrecent history.\nIn the gallery itself, visitors\nto the exhibition are treated\nto atmospheric sounds that\nplay while you view the pho-tographs. Unfortunately,\nthese don\u2019t quite work \u2013 you\nhave to be lucky to be looking at a photograph to the\nappropriate sounds as they\ncontinually change to evoke\ndifferent environments. Most\nof the time, the sounds do\nnot match with what you are\nlooking at. For example, you\ncould be absorbing yourself\nin an underwater photo to\nthe sounds of bubbles, only\nto be wrenched out of it by\nthe screeching of (presum-ably) the golden leaf monkey on the other side of the\nexhibition. By the time you\u2019ve\nreached the monkey portrait,\nthe sound loop is back around\nto the bubbles again. Yet the\nbeauty of the photographs\ndominates this exhibition,\nand the presentation of the\nlit up images in a dark gallery enables visitors to fully\nappreciate how spectacular\nthey are.\nThe BBC Wildlife\nPhotographer of the Year\nAward continues to attract\nthe biggest names in wildlife\nphotography from around the\nglobe, and previous winners\nin the competition include\nFrans Lanting, Thomas\nMangelsen, and Anup Shah.\nAnup Shah is represented\nby four images in this year\u2019s\nexhibition, and he won the\nanimal behaviour category\nfor an image of a golden jackal chasing flamingos. This\naward goes to the best image\nof a mammal actively doing\nsomething, and is judged on\ninterest value as well as aesthetic appeal. The picture brilliantly captures a chase, and\nthe jackal is nicely framed\nby surrounding flamingos.\nWith ears pinned back and\nshoulders hunched, there is\ndefinitely something of Wile\nE Coyote about the scraggly\nsubject as it splashes across\nthe lake.\nShah had a successful\nacademic career in conservation with many journal\npublications, but abandoned\nacademia to pursue wildlife\nphotography. He passionately\nbelieves wildlife photography\nhas conservation value, and\nexplained to Felix: \u201cAcademic\nwriting appeals to the rational\nside of humans whereas wildlife photography appeals to\nthe emotional side. Once you\nget people by their hearts,\nyou can win them over more\neasily.\u201d\nSpectacular images of animals in their environment\nhave the power to generate\nan interest in wildlife and its\npreservation, perhaps having\na greater impact for conservation than academic papers\nthat are hidden in journals.\nPerrine hopes his photo will\ngenerate interest in the conservation of bronze whalers.\nThese impressive sharks are\nin decline, yet they are still\nhunted for \u2018sport\u2019 on deep-sea\nfishing trips around the coast\nof southern Africa. Based in\nHawaii, Perrine is known as\none of the world\u2019s foremost\nmarine wildlife photogra-phers. His underwater career\nhas spanned dive instructor,\nmarine biologist and photojournalist for National\nGeographic.\nHe told Felix that he enters\nthis competition \u201cto win some\nrecognition, hoping to get a\nlittle prize money and some\npublishing contracts\u201d. The\nprestige of the award will\nensure that the world\u2019s top\nphotographers continue to\nenter this yearly competition.\nThe 2005 competition is\nunderway and the organisers are keen to encourage as\nmany people as possible to\nenter before the April dead-line. You do not have to be\na professional photographer\nto enter \u2013 amateurs have\nscooped awards throughout\nthe history of the competi-tion. As a professional, Doug\nPerrine has entered in previous years without success.\nHis advice for the rest of us?\n\u201cDon\u2019t give up. Persistence\nwins the game.\u201d\nThis exhibition in the\nNatural History Museum is\nfree to students of Imperial\nCollege (it would normally be\n\u00a35), so there\u2019s no excuse for\nnot visiting.\n\u25cf More of Doug Perrine\u2019s\nphotos can be seen at\nwww.seapics.com\nShooting fish and jumping jackal flash\nThe 14th BBC Wildlife Photography Competition is on exhibition at the Natural History\nMuseum.
