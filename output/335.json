    "content": "Page 2 FELIX May 15th,1973 but oh, so young! OLIVER DOWSON VISITS\nTHE N.U.S.S. CONFERENCE\nWhen I was at infant school, more\nyears ago than I really care to re-member, we used to play games imitating our elders, like ' Mothers and\nFathers'. We spend most of the time\nsquabbling, as only children can\nsquabble, over all sorts of trivialities,\nlike who was going to say what when.\nOf course, by the time we got ourselves sorted out the bell went for\nthe end of the break and we had to\nget back to our three Rs.\nIam prompted to these reminiscences by my reGent attendance at the\nannual conference of the National\nUnion of School Students, held in\nearly May at City University, London. The conference was indeed just\nlike one of these games, the only real\ndifference being that the children\nplaying the games were aged between 14 and19, instead of between 4 and7. And I cannot help but\nthink that we made a more creditable\nimitation of our parents When in the\nkindergarten than these teeny bopper s make of their peers of a mere year\nor two. It is not my intention to decry the\naims and objects of the NUS, but it\nwould exceed dishonesty on my part\nto tell you that their conference succeeded in achieving anything other\nthan electing a new executive. I have\npreviously, on occasion, been given\nto the belief that NUS conferences\ncould be the height of bureaucratic\ninefficiency. I withdraw all such allegations now. The conference started eighty minutes late with a brief rallying call\nfrom retiring President Bob Leeson,\nspeedily followed by a first-rate demonstration of wrangling from the\nsteering committee, which consisted\nof two people who disagreed with each other over everything. A new amendment to the standing order\nsays that \"all meetings except the\nNational Conference shall be held in\nas informal a manner as possible\". It\nwould be difficult to be less formal\nthan a National Conference, and maybe for that reason Iam not anticipating attending any area meetings (they\nprobably won't invite me, anyway).\nBut I shall bore you if I continue in\nthis vein. You should have already\ngathered an impression of the style of\noperation of the conference. But conference did succeed on at least one\noccasion in sitting down like good children and listening to teacher. The\noccasion in mind was an address from\na fraternal speaker from French\nschool students. They are a little better organised over there: indeed, they\nmanaged to get 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 scholars out\non the streets on two days recently,\nprotesting against \" La Loi Debre\", which would have forced French scholars to take their year's national\nservice between the ages of 1 8 and21 \u2014 thus disrupting their further edu cation. They have achieved a victory\nalbeit with reservations, in having this\nlaw suspended.\nSimilar shows of strength of school\nstudents have come in Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany. In Britain it\nmay be a lot more difficult. There are\nin excess of 2 million scholars aged\n12-18, so the movement has a long\nway to go. 1 0 , 0 0 0 of them are members of the NUSS and pay 2 0 p or\n30p membership each year.\nTo qualify as a branch, a school\nneed only have four members of the\nNUSS and(25 per cent of these constitute a quorum!) I asked the leader\nof the branch at my home town, Lowestoft's Denes High School about the\nrecruitment situation. I should point\nout that amidst the East Anglian sea\nof apathy, Lowestoft is an oasis of\ninvolvement and enthusiasm. Nevertheless, he told me that he had so far only recruited five members from\nhis school (which has a thousand\nstudents). He laid some of the blame\nwith NUSS head office, who had taken seven weeks to send him a supply\nof membership cards, and also on the\nfact that it was now the summer term\nand membership taken out now would only be current for three months; but,\nhe said, most students were prepared\nto co-operate with the authorities \u2014\nat least to some extent \u2014 and were thus not interested in joining a movement that is openly discouraged by\nthe staff.\nLowestoft would seem to be a fairly typical branch. Outside London, the NUSS movement has only tiny\npockets of membership in places such\nas Lowestoft except for a notably\nhigh number in Scotland. Obviously they rely on getting some really involved people in every part of the\ncountry who will spread the word \u2014\nand the membership cards \u2014 around. Bob Leeson said in his opening ad dress that the coming year would make or break the NUSS, and this\npoint was echoed by the candidates\nfor this year's executive. It is obviously going to be an uphill struggle to\nmaintain and increase membership.\nUnlike the NUS they rely on members actually physically joining and paying their membership fees. If and when they gain a membership of considerable size they could thus reasonably claim to be stronger than their\nparent union, since all their members\nhave chosen to join.\nHow are they then to re cu it membership? And, more difficult still, how are they to maintain it? Mr. Leeson\nsuggests that holding a campaign is\nthe only way, and delegates agreed.\nThe question is more one of finding\na campaign that school students\nwill feel strongly enough about to\nmobil is e on a sign fi cant scale. The only demands in their policy Statement which school students would unite behind are probably the abolition of religious education and school\nuniform. And these are by no means\nas contentious as the draft issue in\nFrance and other European countries.\nUnfortunately the NUSS seems as if\nit 'is going to concentrate on other\nissues, if it organises a campaign at\nall.\nIt would be a very sad day when the* NUSS folded. But that day seems\nbound to come if their national organisation remains as bad as their\nconference organisation. It is admittedly only a year this month since the\nNUSS was formed. But, to survive,\nsuch a Union cannot afford to start\ngradually and work upwards. It needs\nto start with a bang. And unless the\nNUSS generates the bang soon them-selves, they might well find it going\noff under them.\nNo Pay\nfor Bookshop\nStaff\nStaff at the IC bookshop worked through the\nlast weekend in March both Saturday and Sunday, without receiving\nany pay at all. Prior to\nthis a notice was sent\nround the staff which\nread something like this:\nBecause of VAT, a complete stock taking must\nbe done by March31 st. This may necessitate staff\nworking the whole of that\nweekend. As is usual in such cases no overtime\nwill be paid. .\nThe reason why overtime is not usually paid\nin such cases can be\nfound in section 8 of the\nterms of service for bookshop staff: \" no overtime\nwill be paid in view of\nthe length of the annual\nleave.\" This is 4 weeks\npaid holiday in the first\nyear for young staff and7 in the second and following years.\nThe stock taking required for VAT had to\nbe continued into Mon day and Tuesday too and the bookshop was closed\non those days.\nFollowing an interview\nwith the RCS bookshop\ncommittee member an offer of an extra one day's holiday with pay was\nmade to the staff, but this\nstill leaves five staff who\ngave up their whole\nweekend to work, without payment in holiday\nor cash for one of those\ndays.\nA POET'S NIGHTMARE\nThe turn of the Taciturn Nan In Africa I travelled south!\n\u2014 I came, Is a w,I closed my mouth;\nThen feared some heartless racial ban For having such a healthy tan,\nSo sat within the shade and saw South African TV... and more.\nAnd more!\nI dozed, then dreamt in hushed distress\nI played South Africa at chess\nBut lost the game in fading light;\n\u2014 Since white could only move on white\nAnd black could only move on black,\nMy moves were only there . . . and back.\nA lack!

He\nhas explained in very vivid\nterms and probably therefore\nwith greater efficiency than\nI, the point I tried hard to\nmake in my series of letters\nto Felix last term.\nThe case he puts forward\nis harsh and over emphasised but makes it quite clear that\nwe can not automatically\nequate the terms \"Church\"\n(in the popular sense) with\n\"Christians\" (in the Biblical\nsense). It is probably a good\nanalogy to explain this if I say that just because current\nLabour Party policy is rather\nwish y was hy it docs not in\nitself invalidate Marx's thesis\nof what we now know as\nMarxism.\nIn the Bible, Jesus, whom\nI willingly concede was\nneither black nor white, but\nprobably the colour of a modern day Palestinian Arab\nI if it really matters), had\nstrong views on people who\npractised piety and religion\nwhich was, in effect, merely\na pastime and nothing to do\nwith either God or living.\nSo, we have the happy\nsituation where Mr. Veall\nagrees wholeheartedly on at\nleast one point with Jesus\nChrist, On the other hand we\nhave an evolved situation\nwhere many so-called religious people have fallen into\nthe trap of becoming 're-spec table'. When we look at\nthe early Christians and especially when we look at\nJesus how incongruous this\npicture is. Jesus was a distinctly anti-establishment figure but His motives were\nalways moral and his life was\na living example of His teach-ing.\nHaving said this, I must\nmake it quite clear that just\nbecause someone belongs to\na denomination which has\ninvestments in S. Africa this\ndoes not automatically label\nhim a hypocrite, for I am confident that most church-goers\nhave never been consulted as\nto where church funds should\nbe invested.\nWhat conclusions should\nwe therefore draw from this\nissue?\nFirstly let us all discard\nthis \"Less bourgeois than\nthou\" attitude and truthfully\ndecide if in the Bible v/e find\nanywhere instructions to\noppress our brothers and\nsisters, look particularly at\nthe Epistle of James, if after\nthis we comb to the honest\n(important word that) opinion\nthat Jesus is responsible for\nthe way we (and here I mean\nall of us) oppress our fellow\nmen then by all means do\nnot become a Christian, but\nif you find that Jesus, the\nrisen saviour, demands love,\nservice, compassion and truth\nand also promises to provide\nthe strength for this task by\nmeans of the Holy Spirit, then\nread God's word, and ask\nHim to show Himself to you,\nyou will not be disappointed,\nbecause Jesus is alive today,\nI 've mot Him, many people\nhave met Him and maybe\nyou, the reader, if you abandon the pride which we all\nhave against being told how\nto run our lives by God, and\nlook to Jesus you too will\nmeet Him.\nTo Mr. Veall I say only\nthis: Think hard, think very\nhard because Jesus Christ\nloves you. .\nYours in Christ,\nMAURICE MOLONEY.\nChem. 2\nP.S.A good and relevant verse is to be found in John8 verse7.( This reads... \"he stood up and said to\nthem' Let him who is without s in among you be the first to\nti now abi one at her'\" \u2014 Ed.! In defence Stop at 2 The Marti n Doughty Column\nof Roy\nMatthews\nSir,\nWe would like\nyour environment\nreaders\n12th is\nAbout\ngroups\ncountry\nSir,\nWith reference to your\nfront page comments about\nthe last presidential (sick!)\nelections we would like to\nmake the following observations: \u2022\nFirstly, in an election, it is\nthe person one votes for, not\nthe amount of campaigning a person does. The amount of\ncampaigning ROY MATTHEWS did is irrelevant. The\nnumber of votes Roy received\nwithout campaigning is indicative of the high esteem in\nwhich he is held in the col-leg e. We'll let you draw\nyour own conclusions about\nRob Armitage,\nSecondly, let us consider\nthe qualifications of each per-son. Rob Armitage has, it is\ntrue, been Rag Chairman and\nExternal Affairs Officer, both\nof which are good recommendations, but on the other\nhand, Roy Matthews has been\nHon. Sec. of I. C.R. U.F.C., President of the Stoats Club\nand Vice - Captain of\nI. C.R. U.F.C. Both clubs have\nrun very smoothly indeed\nunder his able administration,\nwhich is more than can be\nsaid of the Union.\nThirdly it should be noted\nthat Roy did in fact try to\nwithdraw from the elections\nbeforehand, but was prevented from doing so by MCB\nwho said that as his name\nwas already on the ballot\npaper, the nomination should\nstand.\nFinally we ourselves are\nvery thankful to Roy for preventing Rob Armitage becoming Hon. Sec. Who could\nfollow MCB anyway? Perhaps\nhe won't become President\neither. What a crying shame.\nYours nastily,\nALJ (before injury your\nfamous Rugby\ncorrespondent)\nCMW (of GUILDSHEET\nfame)\nCJH (with backache)\nLITTLE DICK\nRAS (I'm a 'coming Mr.\nDillon)\nBIG KEN (give it wigging)\net al.\nP.S. \u2014 Please keep further snide comments out of this\nreputable and unbiased)?) publication and print this letter.

Next\nQuestion\nplease\nSir,\nAs those who attended the\nhustings will know, a question I had written out, to be\nput to all candidates, and\nwhich was the second question handed to P. Jowitt was\nnot asked. At the end of the\nmeeting I found it at the bottom of the pile of questions,\nand P. Jowitt seems to be in\nsome doubt as to why this\noccurred.\nThe question was, \"Do the\ncandidates for President of\nl. C.U. believe that the person\nelected should be independent of this year's Union\nBureaucracy, in view of its\npoor record. For instance,\none of the candidates is a member of the Welfare com-mitte e, but has attended at\nmost one committee meet-ing\" (the one exception being\nwhen my informant did not\nattend which I am not sure\nabout.) This person is of\ncourse 'Norm Sayles' your\nlovable Bot/Zoo Dept. Rep.\nPaul Jowitt told me afterwards that he saw me write\nthe question, then go and tell\nJock Veall what it was, so he\nshowed all the candidates the\nquestion. Besides being a lie,\nif they all knew about it,\nwhy wasn't it asked? Another\nanswer he gave was that he\njust put it down on the table,\nand that he didn't read the\nquestions out, so I should\nblame John Lane. John Lane\ndidn't put the questions in\norder!\nYours, with little faith of it\nbeing printed\nJOHN EAST\n\"ft RF FP' It is a sobering thought that Imperial College is\nvery likely to have a new Rector before it comes\nround to finally elect a new Union President. Sir\nBrian Flowers, who takes over from Penney at the\nstart of the next college year, comes here with a hard reputation for a resilience of purpose which\nshould be well-tested by the massed ranks of\nclam our ing apathy carving their initials on his Georgian shutters on the Queen's Gate Rectorpad.\nTo my mind knighthoods are a splendid embellishment of our great society. If you push and bully\nand press u rise enough and tread on enough people's heads then the system invites you to make pots of\nmoney and become a power-crazed. Rolls chauffeured alcoholic and then . . . . a knight. Hastily adding \u2014 so Felix can appear at least once with new\ncat and masthead (but look what happened to the\nDaily Express when it changed its masthead) \u2014\nthat I don't imagine for one moment that Sir Brian\nfits into this category of industrial Sel s don man. But\ndo all the rich Sir Gilberts of this world really give\nall that service for export or productivity or technological innovation out of altruism?\nWhat other categories of knighthood are offered?\nTo the public relations man, the diplomat whose\nsweet smile carries through every controversy with\nan air of surreal detachment, faith in the present and boundless hope for the future. The man who swims\non as all around him flounder in the sea of perpetual crisis. Such a man is Sir Victor Mooney. To the man of letters, the man who, above all\nothers has a masterful command of the English\nspoken word. How about Sir Michael Doherty \u2014\nalthough he does sound like someone from the Irish\nequivalent of the CB I. And back to the elections, to the man of persistence and endeavour, Rob Armitage, your friendly\ncandidate and surely, for all that money he's made,\nanother knighthood to Paul Wadsworth. A strange\nso cet y indeed.\nWell, my currently blank mind (it's obvious, isn't it?) has prompted me to team up with dogmatism so\nI'm forming a bible study group. Anyone wishing to\nbe interviewed with a view to joining this select\nband of apostles should get in touch with my secretary: The very Reverend Sir Jocelyn Veall,\nc/o The Festival of Light,\nGangwank Street, SW7. Don't fo get to vote today and remember, next\ntime you step foot into the hallowed reaches of\nSouthside Mooney, the words of Genesis: \" Thou shalt not eat of anything that eat eth of itself.\" May rie bs vj.in you in your t me of trouble, my child.\nO a. a,Q Cio N&Oc "

Once again the newly\nelected NUS exec has the usual preponderance of\nCommunist Party members and fellow travellers,\nwith a smattering of IS and right wingers.\nThe elections were free to Icve whom one\nfought on four slates:\nthe CP, who rejected\nJohn Randall, who was elected as President,\nstanding as an in de pen dent; the International\nSocialists \"alternative\nleft\" slate; the IMG who ran on a slate\ntaken from their IMG Grants Broadsheet\npartly written by Piers\nCorby n; and the Young Socialists who, standing for the first time this\nyear, pressed home the\nneed to force the Tories\nto resign and return a Labour government\npledged to socialist\npolicies.\nThe statements on\nStirling made by the\nCP, and allegations of\nsell out over the grants\ncampaign due to lack of\norganization, gave the\nCP slate a tough time\nin hustings, but this was chicken feed compared\nto the uproar that broke\nout whenever a YS candidate spoke. The un holy d in of barks and shouts that greeted\nthem so unnerved Digby\nJacks, who was chairing at the time, to\nprompt him, in an effort\nto quell the hecklers, to\nreveal his innermost\nthoughts on the function of NUS:\" This is\nnot a political meeting\" he shouted.\nThe results for the\nmajor executive positions are as follows:\nPresident:\nJohn Randall\nDep. President:\nStuart Paul\nTreasurer:\nJeff Staniforth\nSecretary:\nSteve Parry\nThe first motion to\nthe conference was one\non gay rights and the\nending of discrimination against gay socs. There\nwas a predictable\nspeech for: 'In this day\nand age one should be\nwishes... break away\nfrom Victorian sexual\nmoves . . . 1 in 2 0\npeople are homosexual\n. . . ' Then surprisingly\nsomeone rose to speak\nagainst: 'These people\nare disgusting perverts\n. . . animals in the sight\nof God... the horrible\nresult of the degeneration of moral values . . .'\nHe got down from the\nmicrophone, went across and kissed his\nboyfriend. All these\nspeeches, for or\nIn short these prop o sale were condemned by conference and seen\nagainst, were being\nmade by Gay Lib guys.\nThis passed, the antics\nwere over (for the mo ment) and the conference turned to the political meat of session: the motions on grants,\nunion autonomy and the\nWhite Paper.\nAutonomy\nAfter the success of\nthe campaign against\nthe government green\npaper attack on union\nautonomy and the ensuing bill proposed by Gil bert Longden, the mo tion and amendments\npassed were to step up\nthe autonomy campaign\nand direct it pati cula rly towards those colleges\nwith little or no autonomy. NUS executive\nwas also directed to lay\ncontingency plans in\npreparation for further\nattacks. The conference\nalso urged all constituent organisations to re^\nlin quis h charitable status for their unions as\nit held them back politically and gave them no\nbenefit other than the\ndubious privilege of not\npaying tax on invest-ment s. Despite a spirited\nspeech attacking the\nLabour party made by\nSonia Hochfelder, NUS will still try to elicit\npromises from the Labour leadership that it\nwill remove any legal\nrestrictions on SU aut-ono my. White Paper\nThe government White Paper on Education titled\nin the same vein as their\n\" Fair\" Rents Act, called\nEducation: A Framework\nfor \" Expansion\" showered proposals for cutbacks in all spheres of\neducation upon a mortified academic world: \u2014\nA decrease in the expenditure allotted to\neducation, in the num ber of places in higher\neducation and in teacher\nsupply. Not nearly enough money will be given to nursery education,\nand moreover that the\nboost in this sphere will be offset by a corre sp on ing decrease in finance\nfor higher education.\nThe money allocated to\nnew buildings is not even\nenough to cover the cost\nof replacing all the pre-1 9 0 0 schools in the\nILE A'S alone. The Paper\nmakes no mention of the\nDevelopment of comprehensive education, of\nwelfare and counsel l nig in schools or of the need\nfor provisions for im mi grant children. It suggests real cut-backs in\nteacher pay.\nIn short these proposals were condemned by conference and seen\nin the light of (a) an\necomonic ally hard-pre s sed government being\nforced to cut back in the\nfield of social services,\n(b) that all rational is at ions made because of\n(a) were, to discriminate\nagainst the working\nclass and in particular\nthe lower paid, and in\nfavour of areas of high\nprofitability viz: the\nboost in poly s of industry based courses.\nPiers Corbyn proposed an amendment tying\nthe grants campaign and the proposed anti-White\nPaper campaign to get h er, he got a standing\novation from the hall\nand the NUS executive,\nand was carried shou l der high down the centre\nof the hall to cheers and claps. The speech\nagainst was hissed and booed and Trevor Phillips gave a vote of thanks\nfor Piers' long service\nfor NUS. Again Piers\nwas carried shoulder\nhigh round the hall and placed in the chairman's chair to shouts of\n\" speech!\" Life membership of\nNUS for Piers was proposed to cheers and conveniently forgotten by\nthe NUS exec. There\nwas a proposal to take\nPiers in parts instead of\nthe motion, to buy him a new purple jumper, to\nauction his old one for N UP E and a condemn ation by Burke, resident\ncomedian and inveterate\npiss-artist, of that con-ference's silliness. Despite such a display of\nwarmth to Piers the man, conference showed its\ndislike for Piers the politician and voted the\namendment out.\nGrants\nThe original motion,\ntabled by NUS exec\nand others, was a men ded in only two spheres\n\u2014 any attempt to link\ngrants campaign with the\npresent struggles against\nthe wages and prices\npolicies of the government was hotly opposed\nby the executive and the\nright wing and voted out.\nAn amendment condemning the lack of action by the NUS over discretionary awards and stating that the NUS should not accept any\nsettlement on mandatory\nawards until the discretionary awards system\nwas abolished, was narrowly carried on a test\nvote but a card vote was still pressed for. Later\non before the result was announced there was an\nattempt to suspend\nstanding order 5 7 , which permits a revote, but this\nwas defeated and then\nthe reason for this attempt became apparent.\nThe amendment had\nbeen passed by the card\nvote but before the conference had fully reas-sem bled, the result had\nbeen illegally announced\nby an exec fellow travel-ler, in an attempt to\nrouse support for a re-vote. Members of the\nexec had also been going round the conference\nurging people to vote\nagainst the amendment\nin the revote. The CP would try any trick in\nthe book rather than accept defeat, but they got\ntheir just return in the\nrevote where they were overwhelmingly defeat-ed, and the amendment\nwas carried.\nThe other defeat for\nthe CP was over their\nproposals for the introduction of a student\nwage rather than the\ngrants system. An amendment to censure the\nexec for ignoring a mandate from Margate\n'72 and not c ir cula ting a document on student wage in time to\nallow discussion before\nthe voting at the Exeter\nconference, was not\npassed. The Exec was mandated not to press\nfor a student wage, though only on the somewhat woolly grounds\nthat conference believes\nthat the majority of\nNUS does not want a wage.\nReplying to a proposal censuring the exec for\ntheir anachronistic protest politics approach to\nthe grants campaign,\nJohn Lane observed:\n\" How many censures of\nthe exec must we have\nbefore the Tory government resigns?\" An amendment was passed for the holding\nof a special NUS conference should a government offer be made, and this would be paid for\nby the larger colleges so\nas not to discriminate\naga is t the smaller, and therefore poorer, ones.\nThe debate on the\nsubstantive (amended)\nmotion was opened by Dusty Miller of the Y.S. He slammed the unreality of the protest approach to the grants\ncampaign in view of the\ncurrent economic crisis.\nHe quoted the Evening\nStandard Wall Street\ncorrespondent who said\nthat there is the mood of\nan impending Wall St.\ncrash in America and quotes one big financier\nas saying that this \" will make the depression of\nthe 1 9 3 0 ' s look like a summer festival\". The summing up by\nJohn Randall to boos and hisses as he was an\nexec member and a speech from the floor\nhad been requested, denounced the idea of the\ncrisis and stated that\nwe must continue the\ngrants campaign until\nour demands are met.\nThe motion was pas-sed.\nMiscellany Throughout the conference posters appeared attacking the NUS sell out in Larbet Tech. Various speakers purported to come from\nLarbet Tech. But what\nand where was Larbet\nTech, and why was Burke, suspect when in ol ved in anything, supporting it? All was revealed in a speech from\nLachie Campbell who claimed to come from\nLarbet Tech. This speech\nbegan in gaelic with a few English words, recognisable amongst the\nflow of prehistoric gut-t ural, like \" struggle\",\" sellout\"\" gas chambers\" and ended being\na condemnation of the\nlack of NUS concern\nwith the smaller colleges in their fights against\ndiscretionary awards\nand non-mandatory un ion membership.\nComment The fact that the CP and the right wing consistently voted against\nany attempt to link the\nthree main motions on\ngrants, union autonomy,\nand the White Paper together in an lysis and action, is blind and deplorable as it can only\ndivide and mislead the\nstudent body. That these\nattacks on students, on\ntheir living standards,\nand on their ability to\norganise, are not seen\nby the CP and the right\nwing as part of the general attacks on the living\nstandards and the ability\nto organise of the working class made by the\nTory government with\ntheir Phase II and Industrial Relations Acts, is\ndangerous and divisive\nof the student body for\nthese are common struggles against a common enemy. Thirdly the fact\nthat these attacks are\nonly explain able in terms\nof the present economic crisis in the capitalist\nworld, whose short-term\nresolution necessitates a smashing of the living\nstandards, and therefore\norganisations, of the\nworking class, means\nthat the only effective action for the student\nbody must have that\nperspective.\nMoreover the CP, IMG and IS candidates\njoined with Burke and Proctor in making jibes\nat the YS candidates\nduring the elections for\nthe Executive Commit tee Members and this\nled to the election of\nthose two worker bash-er right wingers. At the\nMargate conference they\nboth resigned as soon as\nthey were elected, but\nthe inclusion of right\nwing politics into their\notherwise ir rel event and irreverent speeches at\nExeter this year made it\nobvious that this time\nthey were out to get\nmore than laughs. They\ndid not resign.\nTo misquote John Lane: How many censures of the exec will the student body make\nbefore it wakes up, kicks them out and re-elects a leadership that will fight\nin its interests? It is\nclear from the efforts of\nthe CP to thwart the \" no mandatory award deals\nuntil the discretionary\nawards system is abolished\" proposed at Exeter that no holds will be\nbarred to reverse that\namendment in their emergency conference called mid June as it is a distinct embarrassment\nto a party which consistently avoids putting the\npolitical questions to the\nstudents and workers it\nclaims to represent.\n\n"

Accusations have been tossed about, resulting in the gradual\nloss of credibility, which the Union has suffered re-cent ly. To reverse this loss, we must identify the areas of\nour failure correctly. Without doubt, the major shortfall has been the consistent failure of ICU either to\ndiscuss or to take action on external issues. Is this because students do not believe that they should respond\nto the questions of Student Finance, Government Policy on Education, challenges to Union Autonomy or\nracism in Southern Africa? I hardly think so.\nA possible cause of the\na parent disinterest is that\nthe majority of students\nare poorly informed as to\nthe implications and consequences of these issues\non their own lives. This\nshould he the task of the\nExternal Affairs Committee, but any member of\nthe E AC will tell you that\nin its' present form it is\nimpossible for the E AC to\nfulfil its proper role of\nadviser to the Union. The\nsmall and poorly attended\nE AC meetings have no\nhope of ever fulfilling their\nconstitutional mandate,\nbecause of the number of\nissues and organisations\nwhich are now the responsibility of the E AC. Viewing the situation in this Bight indicates that\none way to combat disinterest and apathy in the\nUnion is to expand and\nsomehow re-structure the\nE AC. The expanded body\nwould be able to involve\nmore members of the Un ion in policy making and\nprovide a better flow of\ninformation to the U GM. In this way we can expand the circle of debate\nboth in terms of the number of subjects under debate and the number of\npeople involved.\nThe greater the number\nof people that is involved\nin the decision-making\nprocess, ie the more in\nUnion meetings and committee meetings, the more\npeople will be involved in\nthe action taken, A resurgence in interest in the\nUnion would give a boost\nto election campaigns, and\nperhaps Union Officers\nwould be elected on their\nstands on the issues rather\nthan on their personal ap-peal.\nFrom the point of view\nof the External Affairs\nOfficer a change would be\nwelcome; at present, he\nhas little chance of keeping all his areas of responsibility under control. The\nUnion's attitudes are too\noften determined by a committee of one or two,\nsimply because E AO is\nunable to handle the volume of work handed to\nhim to channel through\nCouncil or aUG M. He is\nnot a sabbatical officer.\nThe proposed structure al lows for the duties of the\nE AO and E AC to be handled more efficiently than\nunder the present st ruc ture.\nThe Groups\nThe basis of the new\nstructure requires setting\nup a number of fact-find-ing and policy-making\n\" Groups\". These would\nbe composed in such a way that the groundwork\non a specific area of external policy would be\nlaid by people with responsibilities or interests\nin this area. For example,\nthe Academic Affairs\nOfficers would be asked\nto help form an Educational Policy Group.\nThe groups would be\nsemi autonomous bodies,\nbut would report to the\nExternal Affairs Board.\nThe Board\nThe composition of the\nBoard would be similar to\nthat of the E AC, but\nwould be expanded to include the Chairman of\neach Group, two reps\nfrom- publicity, and campaign committee and the\nEditor of the External\nAffairs Newsheet.\nThe Groups would, es-sent i ally, be the generators\nof the Union policy, but\nthe Board would compose\nmotions or final is e reports\nto be presented to the\nU GM. The Publicity and\nCampaign Committee is\nenvisaged as fulfilling two.\nfunctions: i) publicise the\nissue before the U GM, and\nii) make campaign proposals to the Board.\nGenerally, the E AO or\nthe relevant Group Chairman would be responsible\nfor presenting the policy\nsubmission to the U GM, along with the campaign\nproposals.\nThis is less complicated\nthan it seems. Submissions\nfrom the Groups would\nprobably be passed\nthrough the E AB virtually unchanged. Where\ntwo opposing positions\narose,. the differences\nwould be stated in preU GM publicity and the\ndebate conducted at the\nUG M.Any campaign proposals\npassed at UG Mw oui d be\nthe responsibility of the\nExecutive, of course, but\nit is hoped that the Publicity and Campaign committee would assist the\nExecutive in initiating\nand maintaining action on\nthe issues.\nResponsibilities\nThe Chairman of each\nGroup would be elected\nby the Group and approved by U GM. He would be responsible for\ndrawing up an agenda,\nand convening the group,\nin consultation with the\nE AO. He would represent\nthe Group on the E AB. The EA O,NUS Secretary and a representative\nfrom the P and C Committee would automatically\nbe members of each\ngroup. Interested Union\nmembers should feel free\nto join the Groups at any-time.\nSeveral Groups have\nbeen identified tentatively.\ni) Educational Policy\nThis Group would consider issues such as White\nPaper and Murray. Hopefully, it would take on\nthe task of considering\nthe role of IC in e duca tion, science education in general, the relationships\nbetween education and industry and employment\nprospects.\nThis Group would not\nbe set up to clash with\"\nAcademic Affairs. It\nwould consider far wider\nquestions than AAC does,\nand would be complementary to AAC. In fact, it\nwould be desirable for the\nAcademic Affairs Officers,\nalong with the PG Affairs\nOfficer to be in this group,\nor send representatives.\nii) International Policy\nThe terms of reference\nhere are- quite obvious.\nMy hope is to have this\ncommittee mainly composed of representatives of\nthe International clubs,\nalong with one each from\nOverseas Students Committee, A AM, and Third\nWorld First. Clearly, formation of a Group like\nthis would be a way to\nbring overseas students interests into the Union, and\nto res uci tate international\nissues like South Africa,\nthe Middle East and\nGreece.\niii) Labour Policy\nThis Group would monitor and try to improve\ncommunications between\nthe Labour Movement and\nthe Student Movement\nIt would be an effective\nmethod of liaising with\nthe College's Trade Un ions, representatives of\nwhich should make up\nhalf the Group.\nOther Groups which\nhave been suggested are\nEnvironment and Conservation, and one to deal\nwith the related areas of\nWomen's Liberation, Gay Liberation, abortion and\ncontraception.\nA structure such as the\none proposed could remove the inevitable sloppiness which characterises\nE AC activities at present.\nPolicy could be properly\nthought out and disseminated. This would probably make Union policy\nmore acceptable to the\nmembership.\nMany campaigns could\nbe sustained, even though\ngeneral attention might be\nfocused elsewhere. A mechanism would exist\nwhereby on-going campaigns such as South Af rica, Greece, Conservation and CHE would be\ncontinued at a low level.\nThis is preferable to sporadic efforts by tiny groups\nto interest the rest of the\nunion. These campaigns\ncan be maintained if\npeople with specific interests and responsibilities\nnormally centred outside\nthe Union structure can\nwork within an expanded\nUnion, over which they\nhave greater control. The membership would be\nable to use the Union's democratic process and\ngeneral facilities to much\ngreater advantage.\nMore people would be\ninvolved in the decision-making of the Union. Perhaps this would go some\nway to eliminating the\nspectre of an undemocratic and unrepresentative Union. In my campaign for\nE AO,I promised to work\nfor what I saw as neccessary to the Union, a better flow of information\nto the membership, a new sheet, more effective\ndecision and policy-mak-ing and greater opportunity for the membership to\ninvolve itself in the\nUnion's activities on specific issues. This plan lays\nthe basis for all these\npromises to be fulfilled.\nTo make this succeed\nwill take time and hard\nwork; but this is the opportunity for people who\ncomplain that things\naren't run properly, that\nthey are being shut out,\nto take a hand and\naccomplish things.\nThis is simply a blue-print; details still have to\ntant that discussions take\nbe sorted out. It is imp or place in the next few\nweeks, so that by midterm the Constitutional\nchanges can be drawn up.\nAny comments are we l come, particularly in the\ncolumns of Felix; let's kick\nit around and get it right.\nThe more criticism and\ndiscussion the better.\nTREVOR PHILLIP SEA O Elect Take three twice\ndaily after lectures\nHEALTH CENTRE,14 PRINCE'S GARDENS1.

These\nsources had spread the news throughout the\ncollege within a few hours of the count finishing on Thursday morning, although there is\na theoretical embargo on the result until the\nelection procedure has been ratified by Thursday's Union General Meeting.\nNorman had a landslide victory over Rob Armitage and Jock Veall, gaining the highest\nvote ever achieved by a Presidential can di date. He scored about 850, against Jock\nVeall's170 and Rob Armitage's120, and was\nelected on the first count.\nPaul Wadsworth had a present at the count, some\nclose battle with Gordon of them observing on be-sident and Secretary on a poll well in excess of the\n25 per cent minimum necessary for the election to\nvalid. It was the fourth\n\u2014 and last \u2014 election for\nPresident this academic\nyear. Pundits were stunned by the high turnout:\nover 700 voted on the first\nday alone, 200 more than\nvoted on both days of the\nlast election.\nUnlike their counterparts in many other University Unions, the new\nPresident and Secretary\ncan by no means be accused of perpetuating an executive chair. Norman Sayles has until now been\nonly a secondary figure\non Union Council, on\nwhich he has represented\nthe Botany and Zoology\ndepartments for two\nyears. Paul Wadsworth,\nalthough prominent\nthrough his phenomenally\nsuccessful handling of\nEnts this year, certainly\ndoes not see eye to eye\nwith the current executive. The election has to be\nratified by Thursday'sU GM. This U GM, which\nwill be (as usual) at 1\np.m. in the Great Hall, is\nalso responsible for electing six floor representatives to Council, the University of London Union representative, two members of the Accommodation Committee and three\nmembers of the Welfare\nCommittee.

The information\nwas leaked by people\nhalf of candidates, and\nthe fact that the news\nspread so fast proves how\nnaive the idea of keeping\nthe result secret until the\nelection procedure is ratified is.\nThe Sayles/Wadsworth\nvictory can only be seen\nas a victory for the \"mod-e rates\". The forthcoming\nregime is already being\nlikened by prominent\nUnion officials as a return to the Hob man/ McCullough days, surprisingly only a year\naway.

No one can pretend that, with a one-way-minded political President and a bureaucracy fetishist as Secretary the Union has\nactually achieved anything this year, apart from\nseverely tarnishing its credibility.\nThe new executive is going to have to work\nhard, harder than any previous executive, to regain this credibility.\nTheir first problem will be getting people to\nUnion Meetings. Union Meetings run the Union,\nbut in quo rate or unrepresentative ones run them\nto pot.\nUG Ms will have to be made more relevant\nto the ordinary student. Okay, grants motions\nare relevant\u2014but pledging support to earthworms suffering under the policies of a wicked\nrevisionist government isn't( at least, not in the\nfirst analysis). And petty squabbles between the\nIMG, CPGB, CPB(M L),YSS S, et al, certainly\naren't. Agricultural methods will have to be taken\nto U GM motions. And it mustn't end with wholesale weeding. The roots need protecting against\nrot and attack.\nWe must welcome the new executive. They\nknow what they have to do.

NUS sets May21 st deadline BACUS (Bristol Area Students Paper)\nREPORTER\nTHE GRANTS Campaign is nearing its culmination for this academic year, for, if the Government\nhas not made a decision by May 21st, it will be\ntoo late for local authorities to implement the\nchange for the coming academic year 1973/4. As\nthe deadline comes nearer, the NUS is exhorting\nits Constituent Organisations to make their feelings\nknown\u2014that the Government MUST meet the NUS\nGrants claim by May 21st. In order to make this\nfeeling clearer to the Government, NUS President,\nDigby Jacks, handed in the following letter to the\nDepartment of Education and Science on Monday,\n7th May: \u2014\n\" THE GOVERNMENT fine, announced its\nreceived the NUS claim grants decision on May in November 1 9 7 2 . 21st. After that date the Since then I have had Government can'tan two letters from the Gov n ounce new rates of\nern ment with an aching grant.

The picket\nwas launched at 9 . 0 0\na.m. on Monday,7 th May, North-East London Poly also occupied their Administrative offices and disrupted lec-te gy of cutting down education opportunity\nfor the people of this\ncountry. The White Paper proposals make this\ninevitable. Tie that in\nwith a grants policy\nwhich ensures that thousands of people will never be able to afford to\ngo to college or university, and you might as\nwell admit openly that\nonly the rich are entitled\nto an education.\nPerhaps, before the\nMay21 st deadline expires the Government\nwill announce new rates\nof grant on which students can actually live.\nBut why has is taken so\nwas told that we have\nMr. St. John Stevas's sympathy.\n\" As a matter of del-i berate, policy, the Government is creating a situation where NUS's members suffer very real\nhardship; potential students are being forced\nto realize that higher\neducation is not for\nthem, but for the three-car family down the\nroad; and the date is approaching fast after\nwhich no move whatsoever from the Government is practicable.

Already many prospective students must have decided in9 t ne Problem will go\naway if they don't look\nthis up until May21 st. AFTER MAY21 st Digby Jacks also announced the decision of\nthe NUS Executive to\ncall an emergency conference of the Union, to\nbe held at Imperial College, London, on 8 th June. He said:\" At NUS's Easter Con ference the Executive\nwere instructed call an emergency conference as\nsoon as the Government\nmade an announcement\non grants. If we have\nheard nothing by May21 st, it means that the\nanswer is no, but the\nlong that NUS's mem.

How do we discuss anything\nwith a Government so bankrupt of policy that\nin a tight situation, all it can think of doing is\nattacking the standard of\nliving of the least well off and destroying their\neducational opportunity?

Each day line for action in May? JOHN LANE President's Piece The saga of refectory prices continues. Over the\nlast few years refectory committee meetings the\nindications of increase in prices have gradually\nstrengthened from a possibility to a likelihood.\nLast week's committee should have received a projected budget for next year but this did not appear\nas the April returns were not yet available. The longer the delay the less easy it will be for students\nto react. For this reason the Union reps, proposed\nthat there be no price increases and that the Governing Body should pay for refurnishing and redecorating the bars and refectories.\nWe were told that the refectory committee does\nnot have the power to increase prices, only the Governing Body has. There will therefore be a special\nmeeting of the Refectory Committee to put a report with all the figures before the Governing Body\nwhich should make clear to them the reasons for\nfollowing the course we have suggested. This will\ntake place on Thursday morning so that the Union\nmeeting at 1.00 on Thursday will know the full picture and be able to act accordingly. The Grants Action Committee has proposed that to put some\nweight behind the Union's position we have a refectory boycott and a picket of the Finance and Executive Committee of the Governing Body on 25 May.\nSince we are demanding that the College defy a ruling of the University Grants Committee and\ntherefore the Government, I believe that this sort\nof demonstration of solidarity is necessary.\nOne point should be made. The Bars and Wine\nCellar make a profit. Previously the Union has said\nthat this should go to re decoration not to sub sid is ing the refectories. Unless the College pay for re-decoration something must suffer. Either price rises\nor staff cuts, reduction in variety or quantity of deterioration of the bars and re fec s. themselves must\nresult. All of these courses run the risk of driving\naway cut om and thus causing deficits. But the fundamental argument remains that we are trying to\ncatch up with inflation. We must neither meekly\naccept mere rises nor reductions in Standards of\nstaff.\nUnion Fee\nThe union gets \u00a3 6 per student from the LEAs,\nplus \u00a3 1 0 , 0 0 0 from the College. A joint union/col-leg e working party has assessed that we need an\nextra \u00a3 4 , 9 0 0 to compensate for inflation and to\nintroduce modest increases in a few areas.

Unfortunately, my imagination doesn't stretch to guessing the scores you got, so I 've decided to print your\narticle and leave anything else to the reader's imagination.\nIncidentally, Janet, can you understand why only you and the male exponents\nof your sport are the only ICACC clubs to send me reports to print every week!\nOLL Y DOW SON Jolly Hockey Sticks\n. . . and all that WOMEN This year, for the first time ever, I.C. ladies' hockey team qualified for a grant\nto play abroad at Easter. After the initial rejoicing at this news, we were faced\nwith the problem of finding somewhere\nto go. This proved incredibly difficult, as\nall clubs we contacted seemed loath to\nreply, and time had almost run out when\nLaren Mixed H.C., near Amsterdam,\naccepted us to play in their Easter tour:\nname nt. By this time, however, all flights\nto Amsterdam had long been booked,\nand so it came about that on Good Friday, 12 intrepid lady hockey players,\naccompanied by a staunch supporter/\ncameraman/chaperon, Mr. J. Chilton\nsailed from Dover in a Force 9 gale, and,\nincredibly, managed to survive 4\u00a3 hours\non a rain-lashed sun-deck (the only space\navailable on the overcrowded boat) to\ndisembark, in various stages of sea-sick-ness at Ostend. We travelled from there\nto Amsterdam, where our hosts conveyed\nus to our accommodation \u2014 a really\nplush motel. There we partook of liquid\nrefreshment until the small hours to prepare ourselves for the impending hockey.\nAt1 p.m. the next day, after \"in for mal drinks at the clubhouse\", the tournament began, and with some trepidation\nI.C. faced their first opponents, a fit-looking bunch called Kameleon. We still\naren't sure what happened, but we won31 after playing 40 minutes. Surprise,\nsurprise, the same thing happened when\nwe played our next round against a team\ncalled W. F.( we never found out what\nthis stood for, though several suggestions were put forward). They seemed\nmore intent on protecting their hairstyles\nfrom the teeming rain under layers of\nplastic bags than scoring goals, and we\nwon again, this time 3-0. Thus inspired,\nwe went on to play our last opponents\nthat day, Huilen, and won 4-0. During\ncelebrations at the clubhouse, we discovered that Slough men's nth team\nwere also taking part in the tournament\n(or at least in the drinking), and thereafter they staunch ley supported us (and\nwatched us playing hockey). That night\nwe attended a festival at the clubhouse,\nand made merry until sometime on Sunday morning, this time varying considerably from person to person. The tournament restarted at 7 p.m. after\nmore informal drinks, and we beat our\nnext opponents, Be Fair( yes, that was\nthe name of the club), by 4-0. This meant\nthat we met Laren Ladies, who had also\nwon all their matches, in the final. This\nwas held on the main pitch in front of\nthe clubhouse, before a stand thronged\nwith spectators, (notably the Slough\nteam, accompanied by several crates of\nHeiniken) and in an atmosphere normally encountered in the Wales-England\nRugby international, we won after a very\nhard game by 1-0 the goal coming in the\nlast minute, making us the winners of the\ntournament. Back at the bar (again!) we\nwere presented with a plaque to mark\nthe occasion, and badges commemorating the 50th anniversary of Laren H.C. The last evening was spent in various\npursuits which shall remain unspecified\n(though it should be mentioned that 4\nmembers of the team were asked to leave\na sex shop in Amsterdam for causing a disturbance \u2014 which shall also remain\nunspecified \u2014 and two of the oldest\nhands were noticed to sleep virtually all\nnext day).\nOn Monday morning we left Laren,\nhaving been invited to next year's tour-name nt, and eventually arrived in Lon don to end the trip with a celebratory\ncurry. Altogether, it was a most successful event, and one which A.C.C. should\nfeel was well worth the grant provided,\nsince we managed to bring home a trophy and impress the Dutch with the\nstandard of I.C. hockey as well as the\nstandard of I.C. alcohol consumption,\nwhich has, after all, been done many,\nmany times before.\nJ. M.M. MEN As is traditional for the time of year,\nI.C. hockey club sallied forth on their\nannual tour. However this was no ordinary tour \u2014 the hockey club had qualified for Europe. Thus, it was exceptionally early on Thursday morning, that\neleven stalwarts met to await the arrival\nof their chauffeur-driven minibus, complete with navigator, which was late as\nusual. The hovercraft journey across the\nchannel was rather rough \u2014 a trip that\nAllen Brown, alias Super Puke, will\ngladly try to forget. Anyway, n hours\nlater we arrived in Zandvoort to survey\nour luxurious accommodation (this is a joke!) situated in the pleasant surroundings of sand dunes and the local Grand Prix race circuit \u2014 no Ron you can't roll the minibus here.\nThe following day, eleven lecherous\nhockey players decided to sample the\nwhores, and mean wares of Amsterdam\nDespite their good intentions, all roads\nled to the Red Light district\u2014Soho has\ngot nothing on this. (For full details\ncontact Dave Rich man,I.C.'s own porn\nvendor). Thus I.C. returned to Zandvoort\nexhausted after their trip. The evening\npiss up was mainly noticeable for Ron Palmer trying to move the sand dunes on\nthe way back to our temporary abode.\nThe hockey tournaments started on\nSaturday afternoon with the I. C.All Stars achieving a resounding goalless\ndraw in their first game. After such a commanding performance we continued\nin the same vein and lost our next match\n2-1, Allen Brown being our goalscorer.\nThe evening's festivities started with a typical Indonesian meal (did anyone\nfinish the noodles?) and continued with\ndancing, drinking, etc. until the early\nhours of the morning (Allen certainly\nworks fast!).\nUnfortunately we had our third game\nof hockey at 10 a.m. the following day.\nAfter a phenomenal effort we arrived on time to find that we had only three opponents. Feeling confident of victory we\nprepared to start. However, foiled yet\nagain, we had to wait for the rest of our\nopposition to turn up. In retribution, we\ndecide to inflict upon them another goalless draw (where was Wonder Boy! !).\nThe next two matches were played for\nhigh stakes \u2014 a long lie in the following\nmorning, since the lower in the league\nwe finished the earlier we played. Now that the chips were down, I.C. powered\ntheir way to two victories, by 5-0 and\n2-1. The goalscorers were Dave Rich man(3), Ron Palmer (2) and John Andrews\n(2). Another enjoyable evening's entertainment ensued during which, despite\nvaliant efforts, Ron Palmer kept possession of his trousers.\nThe following day I.C. defeated Heerlen 1-0 to finish third overall in the\ntournament. We had to keep the British\nflag flying since North East Poly managed to occupy the last two places. I.C. celebrated their victory by flying Ron's only pair of trousers from the flagpole\nwas spent sampling the nightlife of\noutside the clubhouse. Our final evening\nZandvoort or Amsterdam \u2014 what was\nthe strip show like John (Junior of\ncourse)? We returned \"mit k lom pen\" the\nfollowing day.\nSpecial thanks go to Zandvoort Hockey Club for being such excellent hosts.\nThanks must also be extended to our\nthree excellent drivers Ron Palmer,\nJohn Andrews and especially Bob Evans (guess who wrote the report?).\nTeam: Richard Bateman, Richard Cameron, Mike Vieyra, Bob Evans,\nAllen Brown, Dave Browne, Tim Han son, Ron Palmer, Graham Popple, Dave\nRichman, Jag Gahir, John Astley, John\nAndrews and Colin Dyer (or his ghost).\nMajor Car Hire Company\nlaunches scheme for\n18-year-olds\nIf you're under 23 and have ever tried to rent a car, I 've got good news for you.
