Anyone who made it into the\nGreat Hall and the JCR at the start of this week\ncould not have failed to notice this year's Imperial College Union Careers Fair. During the\ntwo days, over 3,000 students came to see 42\ndifferent graduate employers and companies.\nOrganising the Careers Fair would not have\nbeen possible without the help and advice of\nmany people. These are, in no particular order:\nSimon Govier\nMarc Ellis\nStephen Dunton\nDave Henderson-Begg\nFiona Grandison\nTom Cunnington\nRose Atkins\nMichelle Began\nAndy Thompson\nAndy Nu\nGina Mortley\nRebecca Land\nGraham Cox\nPark Communications\nthe staff of QT and the JCR\nand last, but by no means least, the College\nsecurity staff.\nI hope all the people that attended found it\nuseful and I wish them every success in their\nfuture job hunting.\nYours,\nSteven Newhouse\nCareers Fair Manager\nThe Munster Road\nKitchen\nby Samin Ishtiaq\nYou're a student, so you know the feeling: into\nthe third week of term and your entire measly\ngrant has run out, your NatWest bank manager\nhas a poster depicting you as Public Enemy\nNunber 1, the Glasgow-based Student Loans\nCompany has apparently been taken over by\nScottish Nationalists and won't give you a loan,\nand your Mum and Dad - normally very polite -say \"Look, just piss off, you scrounger\".\n(Of course, you beg them and say that the\nmoney will really be spent on tinned tuna at\nSainsbury's. That you haven't been to a pub for\nages. But your smart-alec answer \" Of course\nnot, money grows on bushes. Everyone knows\nthat\" hasn't endeared you to them very much.)\nI could talk about the theory of student\nfinances. About how this miserly Tory\ngovernment has cut student funding by X% in\nreal terms over Y years. About how much better\nthe Australian Graduate Tax system is. About\nthe inequity that university students are almost\nall from bourgeoisie backgrounds. And I could\nquote zillions of studies by the Policy Studies\nInstitute/Institute for Public Policy Research/\nInstitute for Fiscal Studies (rearrange, delete as\nappropriate) about further education as\ninvestment for the future.\nBut this doesn't solve the immediate\nproblem. (Even worse, it makes me sound like a LibDem.) You're skin t broke, reduced to\nnicking sandwiches from the QT (a deplorable\nstate, indeed). One solution (perhaps not open to\nall) is to do what Nils does and to use your\nKenyan Fund. The idea, in economic terms, is to\ndiscount your future earnings and spend them\ncurrently. In other words, spend money that you\nare planning to earn in the near future.\nNils is quite a master at this kind of stuff. He\nuses his credit cards as a bridging facility to the\nsummer holidays (when the earnings start to roll\nin) and transfers money in-between his four\naccounts like a real wheeler-dealer. All of this\nobscures the fact that he is massively in the red.\nBut the lack of money now is a trivial fact.\nPossible earnings in the future are what really\nmatter.\nAnyone objecting to the use of a Kenyan\nFund should perhaps take Mr J Christ's dictum\nabout \"he without guilt casting the first stone\"\ninto account: Do 'real-world adults' not do the\nsame thing with their mortgages and other\nloans?\nStop Press\nSports Results IC vs Royal Holloway\nRugby 1st:IC712 RH Mens Hockey 1st IC 1 -0 RH Rugby 2n dIC046 RH Mens Hockey 2n dIC21 RH Football 1stIC04 RH Mens Hockey 3r dIC30 RH\nFootball 2n dIC23 RH Ladies Hockey 1stIC02 RH Football 3r dIC05 RH Ladies Hockey 2nd IC 0 -4 RH Football 4th IC05 RH Netball 1st IC 23 - 4 3 RH Crossword Answers\nfrom Issue 976\nBOU COrJOODDD \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nD \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHunan a \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\ne \u2022 \u2022 ouD Boa aaD UROP\nUndergraduate Research\nOpportunities Programme\n\u2022Undergraduates:\nHelp members of\nstaff with their\nresearch\n\u2022Paid work available\u2014\nespecially in Summer\nVacation\n\u2022Delaware (USA)\nExchange 1994:\napplications deadline\n12 November 1993\n\u2022Information meeting\n3 November 13.15 -14.00 Room 342\nMech Eng Building\nURO P DIRECTORY19931994 available (free) from\nthe UROP Office, Room 313C Mechanical Engineering Building\nThe deadline for letters is 6pm, Monday\n\n"

    "content": "10 Reviews\nIt's A Great Big Shame\nMike Leigh is best known as a film director,\nwhich is unfortunate as much of his best work\nhas been in the theatre. His latest offering is a funny, complex and moving examination of\ngender roles and the cruelty of love. Set in the\nlate nineteenth century and the present day, it\nfollows two couples who inhabit the same house\nat different times and their marital problems.\nThe first act initially appears to suffer from\nan over-riding desire to romantic is e Victorian\nLondon, and indeed it is easy to sit back and\nwatch the antics of various chirp y Cockney\ncharacters. Kathy Burke, as the dubiously\nnamed Nellie Bucket, gets and deserves the\nlion's share of laughs. She gives a stunning and\nnoticeably assured performance and she is much\nthe star of the show. Nellie is described as a waif, though her circumstances are never fully\nexplained. She dresses as a man, rarely bathes,\nis apparently slightly retarded and is a figure of\nridicule. Most of the scenes take place in the\npub of Mrs Clack, a strange but essentially\ncharitable woman who gives Nellie odd jobs.\nSeveral characters come and go, among them\nthe object of Nellie's misplaced affections, Jim.\nWhen Jim marries, Nellie goes into a decline,\nand that's all I'm saying.\nThe second act changes scene to 1993, and\nthe couple now before us are young, black and\nrestless. This part of the play suffers from\nserious under-writing and the characters are\nsketchy. Special praise though for Gary\nMcDonald as Barrington, an intensely nervy and\nhilariously shy bundle of raw ag gres ion who\ncomes into the lives of Joy and Randall.\nDespite its faults though It's A Great Big\nShame is well worth the effort, and the theatre\nitself is both stunning and cheap.\nTony\nTheatre Royal, Gerry Raffles Square, E15. Tel:\n081 534 0310. Ends 20th Nov. Cones \u00a32. Michael Gunn and Paul Trussell on a rotating horse and cart\n1 PN J[ JD Oleanna\nThese days Shabba Rank's misogyny and\nhomophobia are acceptable on the radio, and\nBenny Hill, we're told was actually a comic\ngenius. Unlikely bedfellows for American\nplaywright David Mamet, but is his new play\nanother nail in the coffin for Political\nCorrectness?\nA male lecturer, David Suchet, and his\nfemale student, Lia Williams share the stage, his\noffice. She is having difficulty with his course\nand in the first act he makes the ultimately\nregrettable decision to help her. But the first act\nis much more than just a prelude to the explosive\nsecond. Suchet arrogantly expounds his views\non amongst other things, the nature of e duct ion, only giving Williams opportunities to speak so\nthat he may interrupt.\nQuaff the interval drink leisurely at your\nperil, because early in the second act we learn\nthat Williams has found Suchet's behaviour\nimproper and has reported him. And herein lies\nthe only niggle about the play. She is the strop py little Ms. of \"dubious sexuality\" who objects to\nwhat she feels is his intellectual snobbery and\nsexist attitude. Then when she has the audacity\nto tell him not to call his wife \"baby\", any sane\nman or woman would snap. Like the stark stage,\nthe characters are black and white so there is no\nconflict of sympathy.\nBut even simply establishing goodies and\nbaddies with just two protagonists and an array\nof thought-provoking ideas to be chewed upon,\nis no mean feat.\nDirector, Harold Pinter, commands faultless\nperformances from Suchet and Williams. The\nsecond act has a sustained intensity that is\ndraining for both actors and audience, so the\nclimax, whilst inherently disturbing, is a welcome release.\nMamet seems to fear the danger of Political\nCorrectness and it would be naive to think there\naren't any. Ludicrous directives demanding\n'person holes' and not 'manholes' are a waste of\neverybody's time. But personally , I'd prefer an\nexcess of PC to none at all.\nRahul\nDuke of York's, St Martin's Lane, WC2. Tel: 071\n836 5122.

    "content": "Feature 21\nStudent Union Reforms\nAndrew Wensley, Imperial College Union President, gives his personal view\non the government's current proposals for student union reform. He explain\nthe objectives behind it and the possible effects on unions such as ourselves if\nsuch a system was put into action.\nJohn Patten's intentions to reform student unions\nwere formally announced to the House of\nCommons on 1st July 1993. These reforms were\nto reinforce choice in student unions. They\naimed to abolish the 'closed shop' of student\nunions by giving students the power to choose\nwhatever collective involvement they wanted. At\nthe same time, they would protect the taxpayer\nfrom supporting activities of a campus union\nthat were unaccountable, either democratically\nor financially, or which represent essentially\npolitical activities on campus.\nThese reforms to be implemented would have\nthese three objectives:\ni) To limit the purposes for which public\nfunding can be used.\nii) To avoid public fund being used for\naffiliation to the National Union of Students\n(NUS) or other campaigning organisations.\niii) To make student unions more accountable\nand fully representative.\nWhile we stay not affiliated to the NUS, I feel we cannot comment on the second proposal\nother than to say this: I believe there have been\nabuses in the past of the role that student unions\nplay at both a local and national level. However,\nthis is not reason enough to rule out a collective\nnational voice for the students of the United\nKingdom, a collective voice that speaks on\nissues that affect students as students. Reasons\nfor this are stated later.\nAs for the first and third proposals, I believe\nImperial College Union (ICU) should support\nthese objectives wholeheartedly, but the means\nthrough which the Secretary of State wishes to\nachieve the objectives are not only impractical\nfor ICU, but will have an opposite and very\ndamaging effect.\nSince ICU is not a corporate body, but in fact\nan integral part of Imperial College, it must\ncomply with rules and regulations laid down by\nthe Governing Body or its nominee. ICU has\nworked very closely with the College to develop\npolicies, controls and procedures which achieve\nthe objectives that the Secretary of State hope to\nobtain. However, the implementation of the\nproposals in detail will jeo pardi se, and in many\ncases, destroy activities to the detriment of\nstudent well-being and to the College and to the\nobjectives sought by the Secretary of State.\nThe reforms would define four areas of\nUnion activity to be 'core'. That is to say they\nwould able to be funded by public funds. These\nareas of activity are to be:\nInternal Representation\nSport\nWelfare\nCatering\nInternal representation would involve the\nfunding of, for example, elections for Union and\nCollege Posts and a proportion of sabbatical\nsalaries dependant on the time spent on 'core'\nareas.\nSport is simply the funding of sports and their\nrelated costs, be they the running of sports\ngrounds or the clubs themselves. In essence,\nmost costs associated with sport.\nThe third item is welfare. This broad\ndefinition would cover such obvious services as\nthe ICU Advice Service, a 'nightline' telephone\nhelpline and personal attack alarms. However, it\nalso covers other less obvious areas such as the\nintroductory arrangements for first years,\nprovision for specific minorities within any\nUniversity, for example students with children,\noverseas students, graduate and mature students.\nThese provisions would have to take the form of\nsocial events, support and advice services. All these activities would be 'core' funded so long\nas the support related to operating within current\nsystems and not campaigning for changes within\nnational policies.\nFinally, and perhaps bizarrely, catering is\nincluded as a core service. Although currently,\nthe student union is not allowed to fund catering\nactivities with its block grant, under these\nproposed reforms they could. Funny old world,\nisn't it.\nBut what would this mean for our student\nunion?\nIf you belong to a club that isn't sporting in\nnature then there would be no funding for it\nunder these proposals. To put it bluntly, it would\nbe perfectly fine to play rugby but not to play\nHamlet. Clubs and societies such as the\nOrchestra, Wine tasting and Debating could not\nbe supported under these proposed changes.\nLikewise, any of our religious, political or social\nclubs could not be funded. All of these clubs\nhave their aim as the desire to improve\nawareness in their subject, part of the process of\nencouraging democratic values. None of these\nclubs could be supported with public funds. If\nyou wanted to join one of these clubs, it would\nbe on a voluntary 'opt-in' basis, you want to\njoin, then you pay your way.\nIf you go to see any of the DJs, bands or\nevents that Ents put on, remember these have\nalways been costed to break even. Under the\nproposed changes, since entertainments are a non-core activity, they would be charged for\nroom space. Since no public funds could be used\nto cover any potential losses, a profit on events\nwould have to be made to cover any future\nlosses. There's always the danger that when you\nput an event on, not enough people would turn\nup to make it worthwhile financially.\nWhilst I say we should support the principle\nof making student unions more accountable,\nfinancially and democratically, I would question\nhighly the means used to implement this under\nthese proposals. For instance, to ensure correct\nmonitoring of public funds, whenever a 'non-core' activity used 'core' services, they would\nhave to charged a proportionate cost. This is in\norder to avoid paying hidden subsidies to non-core activities. In essence, this is acceptable until\none realises the cost of enforcing such a system.\nTo ensure the correct cost is charged, one\nwould have to check every room after it was\nused in order to proportion out such costs as\nheating, space usage, wear and tear, even the\ncost of next year's re decoration. All this would\ntake time. As we have all learnt, time is money.\nThe first implication of such a 'cost charging'\nsystem would be an increase in the\nadministration costs of the Union. Currently they\nare one of the lowest in the country for a union\nof our size.\nTo put it in simple figures, the income for our\nUnion for the coming year is over \u00a3500,000. A lot of money in anyone's language. All of the\nUnion's expenditure meets strict criteria laid\ndown by the government and College to ensure\nno misuse of funds takes place. Under these new\nproposals, up to half (over \u00a3250,000) of today's expenditure could be deemed 'non-core'. That\nmeans we would have to find that sum of money\nfrom non-public funds, from somewhere else. If\nanyone has a quarter of a million pounds kicking\naround, I'd love to hear from you.\nSo there you have it, a brief run through the\nproposed reforms. I personally support two of\nthe three objectives, but the way they are to be\nimplemented would be to the detriment to\nstudents, to the Union and to life at Imperial\nCollege.\nWhat are we doing about it?\nAlready we have had a multitude of meetings\nwith other Unions, with College and with the\ngovernment. All the affected parties, both\nUniversities and Unions, have made deputations\nto the government. But do you want us to? Such\na question will be put to students at the Union\nGeneral Meeting today in the Junior Common\nRoom at l pm. Competition to win gig tickets - see page 7\n\n"

    "content": "16 Clubs and Societies\nSmoking Beagles - Imperials Own Dogs Of War\nPaintball is a relatively new game to the UK( it\nhas been around for five years). IC Splotsoc has\nbeen around for four of them. The idea behind\nthe game is to capture the opposition's flag\nwhich is positioned in their flag base while\nretaining your own. We use C02 powered\nmarkers which 'fire' paintball s these burst on\nimpact marking the player / tree / barricade.\nThe common presumption of non-players is\nthat paintball caters for the Rambos of society,\nthose people with dangerous paramilitary\ntendencies. However, if you expect a crash\ncourse in subversive thug ger y you' ll be\ndisappointed. It's the ultimate non-contact sport\nand strength has nothing to do with it - success\nis dictated by your skill and accuracy with a paintball marker, and sometimes a small amount\nof tactics.\nOn Sunday 25th July eight paintball teams\ngathered for the Brass Eagle 5-man No-Pro. The\nteams present were two Shadow Company teams\nfrom Wales under the names of Peanut and\nCobnut, Plague, Copycats, Leftovers, Imperial\nCollege's own Smoking Beagles, Silverados and\nRush. Fifteen minute games were played on four\nfields. At the start of the day it was announced\nthat the winners would not only receive a trophy\nbut also two free airline tickets to the Costa del\nSol, the Algarve or Canaries - a very nice and an\nunexpected surprise.\nRound one resulted in only two teams, Peanut\nand Smoking Beagles, maxing (eliminating all\nthe opposition by marking them with paint and\nthen getting their flag back to base); the other\nfour teams drew. The first round also saw the\nonly penalties of the day, a hot gun for the\nLeftovers to add insult to the injury of being\nmaxed.\nIn the second round Peanut maxed Rush for\nthe loss of three players, Cobnut beat Plague\nlosing only one, and similarly Leftovers came\nback from negative points only losing one player\nto the Copycats. The Smoking Beagles didn't lose a player against Silverados.\nRound three resulted in only one max, the\nSmoking Beagles versus Copycats, with the\nformer again not losing a single player. Rush\nwere four points (one elimination) short of a max over Cobnut, and a close game between\nLeftovers and Silverados gave the latter their\nfirst win. Plague held Peanut to a draw on Field\nFour, an awkward field with little cover across\nthe middle. Peanut, Copycats and Leftovers\nmaxed their games and the Beagles and Rush\ndrew in round four.\nIn round five both the Beagles and Peanut\nkept up their unbeaten record and the Silverados\nand Leftovers also both won. In the following\nround Peanut suffered their first defeat of the\ntournament to the Leftovers, a game which later\nproved to be decisive in the final placings. In a hard game the Beagles maxed Cobnut with a well timed push. Copycats scored their second\nmax over Silverados on the very even field three\nand Rush drew against Plague.\nIn the final round Plague maxed Silverados\non field one, Rush also finished off with a max\nover the Copycats. The Leftovers maxed for the\nfourth time in as many rounds, this time beating\nCobnut. The crucial game of the final round was\nbetween Shadow Company Peanut and the\nSmoking Beagles. If Peanut could max and lose\nno one they would tie for first place with the\nBeagles. This game took place on field four.\nPeanut won the toss and the Beagles were left\nwith the end that no one had won from all day.\nLong-ball (firing from one end of the field to the\nother with no team moving forwards) ensued\nand Peanut went one down after about five\nminutes. Nothing much happened until the last\ntwo minutes when the Beagles pushed hard\ndown the right and centre, forcing Peanut\nplayers back into the bottle-neck at their end and\nfinally taking them all out and scoring a flag in\ntransit, losing no players. So at the end of the\nday Imperial College's team came out on top in\nconvincing style, unbeaten and triumphant.\nWe meet in Southside Upper Lounge every\nTuesday lunchtime 12.30pm13.30 pm. The first\ntrip will take place on Saturday 30th October.\nThis promises to be a seriously fun day at a very\nreasonable price and includes hire of equipment,\noveralls, lunch and tea/coffee all day for only\n\u00a310. If you are interested come and see us in\nSouthside or phone Warren Hirst on ext 4116.\nYou've seen the film\n*\"You've read the book...\n...NOW TASTE THE FOOD!\nThursday 28th October, Main Dining Hall, Sherfield\n12:00 - 2:00 p.m. "

Yet the many\nservings on offer here are too raw to be easily\ndigestible, although the fact that this is a debut\nalbum should have something to do with it. Oh\nthe idealism of youth. The PJHness of the album\ncan be most clearly seen in the lyrical violence:\n\"You can drink from me/Eat from my body\",\n\"Then with a big bite/I tore his head off, \"Play\nthe game/I want to treat you cruel.\"\nNow maybe this is dec on strut ionis m on my\npart because these lyrics are not really obvious\njust from a casual listening, but they are there\nnevertheless. Only the mournful slide guitar of\n'City Sick' and the jaunty 'Graham Robert\nParker' wrench a smile from the grimace.\nWhich is a shame because I wanted to like this\nfor credibility purposes and now find myself\nmarking it down. I'm disappointed. (4)\nTintin\nReleased on Warner\nRed House\nPainters\nRed House Painters\nI didn't know what to expect of this album - the\nsleeve gives no clue except the 4 AD label,\nwhich suggests either the Cocteau Twins or The\nPixies. But the Red House Painters are an\nanomaly owing more to the folk orientated rock\nof the sixties than the modern indie music. The\nsugar sweet harmonies are reminiscent of Simon\nand Garfunkel, and it is no surprise that they\ncover TAmA Rock' here. Their version is\ndarker and has a more melancholy edge.\n'Evil's' refrain of \"God do you look evil in\nthe dark?\" is supported by a sparse arrangement\nof chiming guitar and rippling cymbals to give a strangely exciting feeling that words cannot\nexpress. Like Neil Young at his best, the songs\nare beautifully melodic and Mark Kozelek's voice is rich and emotive. This is wonderful,\nmoody music to be heard alone late at night,\nwhere no-one can see you cry. Wallow in it. (9)\nGuy\nReleased on 4AD Buffalo Tom\nBig Red Letter Day\nPop to please the pure hearted. Buffalo Tom's brand of ear-tickling thoughtful melodies are\nlike water to a drowning man-woman-hermaphrodite. In this sad world of incessant\nbeat and three chord tricks it ranks up with\nDaDa and their sadly neglected debut last year\n(wo ah! mind the hobby horse). Not a duff track\nin sight here with gems like 'I'm Allowed' and\n'Anything That Way' shining bright in this\ntreasure chest. Talented strumming, listenable\nhooks and a strong not-too-overproduced sound\nare this trio's fourth foray into the album world.\nI 've heard that the live show they've been\ntouting around London lately is a winner, and\non the strength of this collection of songs I can\nsee why.

    "content": "Reviews\nDragon: The\nBruce Lee Story\nJason Scott Lee (Bruce Lee) and Lauren Holly (Linda Lee)\nStarring: Jason Scott Lee, Lauren Holly\nDirector: Rob Cohen\nMaking a biopic can be a dangerous business.\nFor a start not everybody is going to agree about\nthe events on screen. And there are so many\npitfalls. We have all seen directors fall into the\ntwin traps of sentimentality and over-simplification. I have to admit at the start that I suspected Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story to be\nguilty on all counts. What a pleasant surprise it\nwas when it turned out to be one of the most\nenjoyable, funny and touching film biographies\nfor a very long time.\nIn retrospect, the plot is just a little bit far-fetched. Young Bruce Lee leaves his home in\nHong Kong and settles in San Francisco's self-contained Chinatown. Dreaming American\ndreams and washing dishes during the day, our\nyoung hero fills his evenings studying to\nimprove himself and managing to find some\ntime to lay some amazing 'Asian babes'.\nThis annoys the cook who attacks Lee\n(basically just an excuse for another excellent\nKung-Fu set piece); the poor lad is sacked and,\nwith the help of the owner, goes to college.\nThere he meets the alarmingly blonde Linda;\nthey fall in love and get married. Together they\nstart a fight school and break the rules by\nteaching whites and blacks. Lee invents a new\nform of fighting, is temporarily handicapped,\nmoves into TV, goes back to Hong Kong, has a son, has a daughter, makes 'Enter the Dragon',\nbecomes embarrassingly famous, moves back to\nHollywood and dies mysteriously.\nThe most notable thing about Dragon is\nprobably the fact that it is completely impossible\nto dislike anything about it. It is a total triumph\nof the art of captivating your audience. Any\nhostility you may harbour will melt in the face\nof such a wantonly assured and enjoyable film.\nThis is largely due to the steady direction of Rob\nCohen; the fight scenes in particular are handled\nperfectly with just the right amount of humour.\nBut the film belongs to Jason Scott Lee, who\nhere turns in a performance worthy of just about\nevery accolade you can think of. It is notoriously\ndifficult to credibly portray a real person, and\nthe results can often be quite startlingly bad -the Kevin Costner effort in 'JFK' will live in my\nmind forever. The other extreme can be just as\ncounter-productive, as anybody who watched\n'My Left Foot' and felt the urge to jump up and\nshout ' W ANKER!' at Daniel Day Lewis can\ntestify. Lee is quite simply stunning, and quite\nfrankly gives one of the sexiest performances of\nthe year. He clearly avoids becoming obsessed\nwith detail and instead attempts to convey\nsomething of the essence of the legend. This boy\nwill go far, and has already been talent spotted\nby some of the biggest names in Hollywood.\nEveryone else is excellent too, especially Robert\nWagner as a back-stabbing producer, though he\nwill always be that blok e from 'Hart to Hart' in\nmy mind.\nIn conclusion, this film is just the best I have\nseen for a long time, kicks the ass off 'What's love got to do with it' and should be compulsory\nviewing for the entire planet.\nTony\nThree Colours:\nBlue\nStarring: Juliette Binoche\nDirector: Krzysztof Kieslowski\n\"Blue\" is the first of a new trilogy of films by\nwriter- director Krzysztof Kieslowski whose\nprevious works include \" A Short Film About\nLove\" and \"The Double Life of Veronique\".\nNamed after the three colours of the French flag,\nthe films of the various hues are meant to\ncorrespond to those values that the colours of the\nflag are meant to represent: liberty, equality and\nfraternity.\nIn \"Blue\", Juliette Binoche plays Julie - a woman who loses both her husband and child in\na road accident which she herself survives. The\nfilm tracks Binoche's attempt to restructure her\nlife, form which she tries to remove everything\nthat would remind her of the past by abandoning\nfriends and moving to a different district. I was\nnot impressed by the performance given;\nBinoche seems simply to be in an angry, sulking\nstate throughout, showing virtually no change in\nemotion.\nThe film flits from one idea to another from\nscene to scene, with hardly a story to speak of\nbut perhaps this is the writers attempt to\nemphasise the emptiness of Julie's life. A key\naspect, though, is the music that Julie's husband\n- a famous composer - was working on and had\nnot completed at the time of his death, and\nthroughout, the camera wander towards blue\nobjects of some significance, drawing attention\nto the title of the film. In particular whenever\nJulie has a recollection of the past, the screen\nturns completely blue and is accompanied by\ndeafening music, supposedly composed by her\nhusband. I just was not progressing and the\nimpression was given that the fact that the man\nhadn't completed his score was more of a tragedy that the loss of his life.\nTechnically, \"Blue\" is outstanding, with\ninnovative use of both sound and pictures but\noverall, it seems like an insignificant jumble of\nview thrown together and then punctuated with a conclusion that comes \"straight out of the blue\"\nwith little to do with what had appeared earlier\nin the film. If you want to see a really good film\nabout music and emotions, watch \"Un coeur en\nhiver\".\nAmir Rehman Khan\nThe latest recording of the WarRequiem is reviewed on page 8\n\n"

Some people, when they\ncouldn't find the answers, made up a response\ninstead and these provided much entertainment\nfor the markers, as did the treasure that was\nbrought back.

    "content": "22 Editorial\nEditorial\nFor those of you who didn't realise why\nhundreds (although it seemed like thousands) of\npeople invaded the whole of Imperial College\nyesterday, let me explain. It was because of\nsomething called 'Commemmoration Day',\nwhich means that people who graduated last\nsummer decide that it would be fun to spend the\nday going round in posh clothes and a gown\nwith a pretty coloured hood. Not only that but\nthey also get to spend two and a half hours\nsitting in the Royal Albert Hall waiting to walk\nup to the front and have their name read out.\nSounds thrilling, doesn't it! Not only have I had to put up with the generally overcrowded\nUnion building, but all day I 've had people\ncoming up to me and asking me why I'm not\ndressed up and why I'm not going to the\nCommommoration ceremony. I don't know if\nit's just me, but it all seems a bit pointless.\nMaybe if I'd worked a bit harder during my\nthree years here, I'd feel differently about it, but\nas far as I'm concerned I 've finished my degree\nand that's it.\nOne good thing about Commemmoration\nDay is the Commemmoration Ball. I'm taking\ntonight off so that I can go (shock, horror!). As\nyou probably know, it takes women ages to get\nready and they're still late, so I'm off now.\nThanks to everyone who is going to be\ncollating, I really appreciate it.\nSecret Diary OfA Fresher\nAged 18 and 3/4\nDon't Forget\nThe clocks go back by one\nhour this Sunday\nSaturday 2nd October\nDear Diary,\nMoved in to hall today. My room is tiny. One of\nthe hall rules is no pets, probably so that you\ncan't find out if there's enough room to swing a cat. There's one advantage though, I can make a cup of coffee and toast, put a tape in my stereo\nand reach over for a copy of Felix without\ngetting out of bed. Met the warden, who's about\n40 and dresses like a fashionable teenager, of the\n1950s. Oh well, I suppose he means well. I knocked on the door next to me and introduced\nmyself. It's occupied by a girl called Theresa.\nShe looks like she should be studying Sociology\ninstead of Physics. I think that, despite the six\nlayers of really baggy, grey jumpers, and skirt\ndown to the floor,that she's actually quite thin\n(bitch). She seemed okay really, even though\nshe's got green hair. She talked for ages about\nvegetarianism. I explained to her that I was a vegetarian but I'm one that eats meat and fish.\nWell, it's the thought that counts, isn't it?\nSunday 3rd October\nDear Diary,\nGot up around ll am. Laughed at those looking\nvery green in the kitchen as I cooked a fried\nbreakfast. Went to Hyde Park with four others,\nto feed the ducks. Everyone had to talk for five\nminutes about themselves. I told them my\nhobbies were under-water basket weaving and\nhamster juggling. I also mentioned that I'd spent\nlast year teaching English to Amazonian\nPygmies after I cycled across the Sahara. They\nall believed me but I think the bit about\nwater-s king across the Atlantic might have\nstretched it a little. Rob 'who-lives-across-the-hall' said he wasn't getting a grant so\nhe was in debt straight away instead of after the\nsecond week. I don't think my money's going to\ngo far so I'm thinking of getting a job as a temporary post woman for Christmas. It won't be\nmuch but it's better than walking the streets!\nTheresa said she wanted to work with exploited,\nmalnourished children, I suggested MacDonalds\nbut she didn't seem to like the idea.\nMonday 4th October\nDear Diary,\nHad to register today. Spent an hour and a half\nin a queue full of people I didn't know. One prat\nstarted busking, it would have been okay but he\nonly knew John Denvers 'Leaving on a Jet\nPlane'. I think everybody in the queue wished\nthat he would be, preferably one that was going\nto Guatemala. There was a blok e behind me who\nkept going on about Socrates while I smiled\nsympathetically. The one in front was a little\nmore interesting, being an out and out Marxist.\nTalking to him was a real education. I 've now\nrealised what imperialist capitalists my parents\nare, shoring up the corrupt and decadent fac is t state in which we live, exploiting the workers by\nforcing them to slave for meagre wages while\ntheir bloated plutocratic masters reap the\nbenefits. I sent them a letter telling them this. I also asked them for 50 quid as well 'cos my\ncheque books not come through yet.\nCredits\nRose Atkins\nAndy Thompson\nSteve Newhouse\nAndrew Tseng\nLynn Bravey\nPaul Dias\nShaun Joynson\nJon Jordan\nOwain Bennallack\nJoe McFadden\nKamran Malik\nRehka Nayak\nSamin Ishtiaq\nCharlie Leary\nTony Grew\nMike Chamberlain\nRichard\nJuliette Decoch\nDiana Harrison\nPhill Henry\nIvan Chan\nKin Wei Lee\nCollators Last Week:\nJaymz 'n' Tamsin\nPenguin\nJon Jordan\nOwain Bennallack\nPart time vacancy\nPart-time sound and lighting engineer\nrequired in London area.

The case only came to\ncourt because the defendant\nprotested his innocence and\ndemanded the police be brought in.\nMs Fox condemned as \"disgusting\"\nthe apparent attempt by King's College authorities to cover up the\nmatter.\nEarly reporting of sex assaults\nby a male student is vital, Ms Fox\nbelieves, as the medical examination that will be carried out by\nthe police could provide the vital\nevidence needed to secure a conviction.\nMs Fox also said that when\nwomen have been assaulted, the\nfirst thing they should do is call the\npolice and then college security if\nthe incident occurs within college\nRadical changes to Imperial College\nUnion (ICU) are promised at\ntoday's Union General Meeting\n(UGM).\nThe U GM marks the second and\nfinal stage of the introduction of a new ICU constitution. The reforms,\nspearheaded by Chris Davidson,\nlast year's ICU President, include\nthe conversion of the Executive\nCommittee to a decision making\nbody and the abolishment of\nCouncil.\nThe reforms were designed to\nincrease the representation of\nstudents. As such, through a hierarchy of representation, every\nsingle aspect of student life at\nImperial College should be\nreflected in the new Executive\ngrounds. Where the assault occurs\nin a student's lodgings or off\ncollege grounds she says that there\nis no reason to refer to college\nsecurity and to go straight to the\npolice.\nRealising the ordeal many\nwomen could face in sex assault\ncases, Ms Fox qualified her advice\nby saying that a deciding factor in\nwhether a woman reported a sex\nassault or rape to the police would\nbe the personality of the victim.\nWhilst recognising that the\npolice take a more sympathetic\nattitude to rape, she warned that\nlawyers acting for the defendant\nwould try to use the woman's sexual history in order to secure an\nacquittal for their client.\n\"Let's say a woman has had\nseveral sexual encounters (prior to\nthe incident), then the defence will\nbring this up.\" Nonetheless,\ncontinued Ms Fox, the police will\nbe supportive towards the woman\nand give her plenty of en-courage ment. Ms Fox's advice was supported\nby a leading women's pressure\ngroup who demanded on IC Radio\nthat the Crown Prosecution Service\n(CPS) bring every rape case to\ncourt, even if there is a risk of the\naccused being acquitted.\nCommittee. In addition, the changes\nattempt to increase the accountability of those 'in power' by\nholding UG Ms more frequently.\nUnder the new reforms, UG Ms would be monthly rather than\ntermly.\nIf the constitution is passed then\nthe Executive Committee will become a sub-committee of a Union\nGeneral Meeting. This means that,\nsubject to certain limitations, it will\nbe empowered to make decisions on\nbehalf of the sovereign body, the\nUnion General Meeting. This is a substantial change from the old\nCouncil which, though it made\ndecisions, did not have the backing\nof a Union General Meeting.\nFollowing a wide-ranging outcry\nKate Wheldon, spokesman for\nWomen Against Rape made the\ndemand during the interview on\nWednesday night. She told\npresenter Declan Curry that only\none in twelve cases were ever\nbrought to court and claimed that\nmany men were not being charged\nbecause women were frightened of\nbeing stigma tis ed if they admitted\nthey had been raped.\nShe also hit out at the press\nreaction to the Donnellan case,\nclaiming that the media were\nholding Mr Donnellan up as a hero.\n\"The press have used this case to\nattack all women,\" she said. Ms\nWheldon pointed out that the\nconviction rate for rapists was one\nof the lowest for any type of\ncriminal offence. She blamed this\non both the way in which the police\nhandle rape cases and the direction\njudges give to juries in telling them\nnot to accept the woman's story\nwithout corroboration.\nMs Wheldon criticised the\nattitudes of the police and CPS to\nrape saying that it made many\nwomen wary of reporting incidents\nand could even encourage potential\nrapists. \"If men feel that women\naren't going to be able to report it,\nthat is when they rape.\".\nby supporters of the Constituent\nCollege Unions and the revelation\nthat the Chairmen of the Major Subcommittees (SCC, SCAB etc) do\nnot wish to be members of the\nExecutive Committee (their\nrepresentation being satisfied by the\nvarious sabbaticals), amendments\nare also likely to be put to the U GM on these matters.\nCommenting on, the U GM, Andrew Wensley, ICU President,\nsaid, \"it should be fun.

Wilfred\nOwen's lacerating poems, with their reek and\nhorror of the trenches, and their subversion and\noccasional implied negation of established\nreligion, do not sit easily alongside the Latin text\nof the Missa pro defunct is. Selected with care,\nthey provide an apt and disturbing reflection on\nkey aspects of the liturgy, and this conflict\ncontributes to the unsettling power of the work\nas a whole.\nOne of the best examples of this occurs in the\nOffertorium; after the choir'sfu gal 'Quam o lim Abrahae' comes a setting of Owen's version of\nthe Abraham and Isaac story. From amidst\nglittering harp and woodwind, the angel appears\nto stay Abraham's hand: \"But the old man would\nnot so, but slew his son, / And half the seed of\nEurope, one by one.\"\nIn the War Requiem, Britten has succeeded\nnot only in making a deeply-felt statement about\nhis pacifist beliefs, but also in seizing the\nimagination and emotions of an audience vast by\ncontemporary music standards. Within months\nof its appearance in 1963, the composer's own\nrecording had sold 200,000 copies, and today\nperformances are not infrequent, despite the\nhuge forces involved.\nThe work requires three distinct and spatially\nseparated groups of performers; the first, a boys'\nchoir accompanied by organ, the second, a soprano soloist, large chorus and orchestra, are\nused for the Mass, while the third, tenor and\nbaritone soloists and chamber orchestra, are\nreserved for the interpolated Owen settings. This\nmay cause difficulties in the concert hall, as a venue large enough for the chorus and orchestra\nto be given free rein does not have the intimacy\nrequired for the chamber group. The problems of\nbalance are more easily solved by careful\nmicrophone placing and mixing in the studio,\nand the new Deutsche Grammophon recording,\nwith John Eliot Gardiner and the North German\nRadio Symphony Orchestra, is the latest of\nseveral successful digital versions of the work.\nThe shattered bells on the cover, victims, this\ntime, of allied bombing, are preserved in the St\nMarienkirche in Lubeck, where the new\nrecording was made at a live performance during\nlast year's Schleswig-Holstein Festival. In fact,\nit's impossible to tell that an audience is present\nat all, as there's not so much as the faintest rustle\nof a sweet-wrapper. What is immediately\nobvious is the superb recorded sound - clarity,\nnaturalness of perspective, and huge,\nun congested climaxes. D G are promoting this\nissue as one of the first to use their new 4D Audio technique. Perhaps I should explain this,\nsince this is a College of Science and\nTechnology: It involves a21 bit A/D converter\nactually on the recording platform, giving a\" galvanic ally separated digital network which\nensures interference-free transmission\". So now\nyou know. Whether the quality of the recording\nis due to this new technology or to the skill of\nthe engineers, I am not in a position to judge, but\nwhatever the reason, the results speak for\nthemselves.\nThis is without a doubt the most purely\nbeautiful of available versions, right from the\nbells at the very opening, clean and bright in the\nspacious acoustic. Tenor Anthony Rolfe Johnson\nmakes a lovelier sound than any of his rivals; the\npoignant 'Move Him Into The Sun' from the\nDies i rae is especially ravishing. But, perhaps\nbecause brass and choir are too intent on\nproducing a beautiful sound, the crucial opening\nsection of this movement just isn't savage\nenough. Simon Rattle and the CBSO on EMI are\nsupreme here, the stench of the pit seems to waft\nat their very heels: sour brass, spitting chorus,\nit's sulphurous stuff, and Rattle unerringly paces\neach seismic convulsion. He is less successful,\nhowever, at drawing out the work's beauty; his\nacoustic is dryer, and in the Agnus dei, for\nexample, he is plainer than Gardiner and the\nluminous Rolfe Johnson.\nTo go from Gardiner to Britten's own\nrecording is to move into a different sound-world. Closer-miked (boys' choir very upfront,\nalmost brash), weightier and darker, the 30 year-old Decca recording wears its age well, although\nthere is inevitably tape-hiss, and some\ncongestion in loud passages. The reading is the\nmost urgent and pungent of all (try the acidic\nwoodwind flourishes at the beginning of the first\nOwen setting), but tenor Peter Pears is a drawback, despite his many textual insights, due\nto his tendency to become constricted and nasal.\nOf the modern versions, closest to Britten's is\nthe Gramophone award-winning Chandos\nrecording by Richard Hickox. His first-hand\nknowledge of Britten's operas stands him in\ngood stead, and this is the most dramatic and\ninvolving version as far as the Owen poems are\nconcerned. 'Abraham and Isaac' is gripping in\nits theatrical concentration, and Hickox revels in\nevery sudden shift of mood. And in 'We've\nWalked Quite Friendly Up To Death' he finds\nthe swagger which eludes Gardiner (soloists\nPhilip Langridge and John Shirley-Quirk are\nexcellent here). The opening of his Dies i rae, too, has more bite. But in the big moments of the\nsecond half, even Hickox has to yield to the new\nD G set. Under Gardiner, the 'Osanna' is a glorious explosion of rippling brass (Hickox and\nthe LSO sound strained at this point) and the\nfinal Libera me gathers inevitable momentum\ntowards a huge, totally unrestricted climax.\nIf blood and thunder are your first priority,\nthen it has to be Rattle. For a deeper insight into\nthis awesome masterpiece, my desert island\nchoice would be Hickox (which is also the only\nversion to offer any fillers - the Sinfonia da\nRequiem and the Ballad of Heroes. Otherwise\nit's85 minutes of music on two CDs, not great\nvalue). But for sheer beauty and splendour,\nGardiner's new recording demands to be heard.\nRag's latest ache ive ment s can be found on page 17\n\n"

In\nthat time though their music has evolved from\nmurky obscurity to a more popular stance.\nOn 'Grave Dancer's Union', Booker T and\nhis amazing Hammond Organ feature\nthroughout, as do the ludicrously named Golden\nSmog Choir. Apart from the single 'Runaway\nTrain', also check out ' 9 9 % ' - the schizoid\nlament about imperfect relationships.

There we are, but I suppose you want to know a bit more than that.\nFamous for five minutes last year with their\nwacky single 'Where's My Jumper', the Sultans\nplay tongue-in-cheek-pop-rock with a big dose\nof cynicism thrown in. They're better live than\non record and this single isn't as good as their\ndebut album. However, it's still groovy even\nthough they are sounding more and more like\nHalf Man Half Biscuit.

'Lovesick' is an angry reaction to the\nblind sentimental fool phase and the subsequent\nrealisation that you were nothing but a victim of\nspiritual robbery. The dizzy heights of stardom\nmay not be in their grasp, but they know the\nstory of my life.\nCamille\nReleased on Incoherent Records\nBryan Adams\nPlease Forgive Me\nIs Bryan Adams the idol which Middle America\nhas craved and the rest of the McDonald\nmunching world fawned for?

'Chaos AD' is the Brazilian foursomes\nmost brutal to date. Alex 'Fudge Tunnel'\nNewport's assistance in the rhythm guitar\ndepartment has resulted is a sound approaching\n(but never quite equalling) the sickening,\ndetuned intensity to be found on Entombed's magnificent 'Wolverine Blues', whilst retaining\nSepultra's trademark crunch.\nThe songs tend to be slower than on previous\nofferings, for the most part making their impact\nwith sheer crushing bludgeoning power rather\nthan breakneck speed. There is also a greater\nmix of styles than ever before; from the all-acoustic 'Kaiowas' to the hardcore rattle of\n'Biotech Is Godzilla' with lyrics (and\npresumably title) by Jello Biafra.\nAll in all, Sepultra's strongest, heaviest and\nmost mature collection of songs to date.\nSmashing.
