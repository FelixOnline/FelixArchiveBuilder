    "content": "Do, Make, Shins Think?\nThis week we take a look at the new Do Make Say Think and Shins albums\nDrummers, drummers, drummers.\nIf you have ever been in a band or\ntried to form a band, you\u2019ll know that\ntrying to find a drummer is like trying to find reason amongst a group\nof fundamentalist Christians. When\nI stumble across a group with more\nthan one (good) drummer, it really\ndoes make me ponder how long it\nmust have taken to find skin beaters of such quality in a non-singular\namount, or in simpler terms, wow.\nAnother thing I am a sucker for\nis horns, and I love me a good horn\nsection like a pig enjoys wallowing\nin its own muck. If horns and two\ndrummers collide, only perfection can come from it; go listen to\nSoeza (from Bristol and on Gringo\nRecords) and you will understand\nmy point completely. Do Make Say\nThink employ both the use of two\ndrummers and a mighty horn section and make the kind of triumphant music that if those aforementioned Christians played it to you,\nyou\u2019d be converted in an instant\nand demand the rapture.\nDo Make Say Think are part of\nthe Constellation Records collective which exist out of Montreal\nand contains many a band that has\nsomething to do with Godspeed\nYou! Black Emperor. However, Do\nMake Say Think \u2013 of Toronto, Ontario in Canada \u2013 have very little to\ndo with Godspeed, and this makes\nthem rather refreshing amongst\nmost of the Constellation gathering.\nFor those who like their Canadian\nindie-pop, key-players in Do Make\nSay Think, Ohad Benchetrit and\nCharles Spearin are also in Broken\nSocial Scene. Therefore, Do Make\nSay Think actually know about creating one of those things they call,\nerm, melodies.\nEnough scene-setting, I want to\ntalk about this album. You, You\u2019re\nA History In Rust is Do Make Say\nThink\u2019s first album in about 4 years\nand what is remarkable about it\nis that is contains vocals, but you\nare probably wondering why this\nis remarkable. Well, in the past, Do\nMake Say Think were lobbed \u2013 understandably in some senses \u2013 in\nthe genre pit they call post-rock because they made instrumental music that in some instances rocked.\nHowever, where post-rock can be\nseen to be miserable semi-compe-tent musicians pummelling away\nat the same riff until their hands\nfall off (see Mono\u2019s last album), Do\nMake Say Think were inventive and\ninclusive in their instrumental rock\ncalling upon the Jazz gods and the\nspirit of Can. Now with You, You\u2019re\nA History In Rust they are incorporating vocals, but only on two of the\nsix tracks, and it really does make\nsense.\nIt makes sense because if you go\nand listen to their previous albums,\nyou notice that there is a cohesive\nsound to the music: Goodbye Enemy Airship The Landlord Is Dead\nhas an angular, repetitive cold\ntexture to it which truly reflects\n2000, also the year of Shellac\u2019s 1000\nHurts which sported a harsh and\ncold sound; & Yet & Yet sported a\nbrighter and looser jazz feel at a\ntime of fear in North America (early\n2002), this album reflected a move\naway from harsh and simple tones\nto more improvisation-based music\nwith sample manipulation in the underground scene inspired by bands\nsuch as Tortoise, and more closer-to-home acts such as Four Tet\ngetting recognition; Winter Hymn\nCountry Hymn Secret Hymn, released in 2003, hinted at more pastoral and folk-inspired tones yet\nretained a harsh edge as heard on\nGoodbye Enemy\u2026 with a string\nMatty Hoban\nTrencher Lover\nW\nell, well, well I\nbet you missed\nyour music section haven\u2019t\nyou? What? No,\nyou didn\u2019t? Well, that just hurts in\nso many ways you\u2019ll never under-stand. Anyway, we\u2019ll kick back into\naction with two pages of reviews\nand an interview with some band\ncalled The View. I hear they are\nthe NME\u2019s next best thing since\nlast week, so I will probably following their career with great\nignorance.\nEnough morose behaviour, I\nwas tired of bad music getting\ncoverage and not enough attention being given to good music,\nso I reviewed the new Do Make\nSay Think album which is out on\nMonday. I hope you aren\u2019t put off\nby my hyperbole but if you have\nfollowed the successive albums\nthey put out sporadically then you\nshould be excited. They tip-toe\nacross the line between self-indul-gent improvisation and tight pre-rehearsed melodic and rhythmic\npunches, and pretty much always\ncome out with the goods.\nThere may be a chance that you\nhaven\u2019t heard of Do Make Say\nThink before, but their music is\navailable in different means and is\nworth checking out. But this week,\nI have been thinking about instrumental music and its nature.\nI know a lot of people when they\nfirst hear an instrumental band\nare stricken by the lack of vocals\nand can\u2019t get past it. It just shows\nthat with a lot of modern music,\nan emphasis is put on the vocals,\nlyrics and \u2018front-man\u2019. All I know is\nthat if I listen to a band with vocals\nand the backing music is uninven-tive and uninspired and precisely\nthat, backing music, I am turned\noff.\nIt appears we have never moved\non from the 50s and 60s band\nformation such as Jerry and the\nPacemakers. I don\u2019t want to hear\nthe instruments buried in a mess\nthat necessitates the lead singer,\nI want to hear bands working\nas a whole. This tenuously describes the difference between Do\nMake Say Think and The Shins:\nDo Make Say Think make music\nthrough a communal effort and\nthere are many brilliant layers,\nwhereas The Shins struggle to\nmove beyond simple structures,\nideas and layers. The Shins first\nalbum showed both their scope\nand their pinnacle.\nsection becoming more prominent\nwith hints towards the work of Six\nOrgans of Admittance who was\ngaining stature at the time. Do\nMake Say Think albums seem to be\nboth introverted in that they reflect\nthe progress of the relationships\nin the band, but they are reflective\nand seem to absorb the musical environment around them.\nWith their new album, they appear to have taken on board many\nof the ideas and feel of the recent\nresurgence in folk-inspired music,\nboth psychedelic and lo-fi. Akron/\nFamily make a high-powered (and\noccasionally loud) folk racket and\nthey seem to be an inspiration and\nkey collaborator (I imagine they\nsing the vocals) on this album. So,\nacousticguitarsandloose,andquick\nwaltz-time drumming is the order\nof the day and oh, how delightfully\nthey do it. The range in dynamics\nalso invigorates the music where\nA With Living has hushed acoustic\nguitars and group singing and The\nUniverse! has foot-on-the-monitor\nriffs up to the eyebrows. This album\nis both raucous and delicate like a\nload of folk musicians piled up into\nthe back of your local pub and pissed out of their minds whilst two\nblokes in the back hit as much stuff\nas they can.\nWhen they were recording this album they were recording a community giving each other a big musical\nhug and sloppy kiss. Fun, yes fucking fun! Something you will never\nhear uttered in the same passing\nphrase as post-rock is the word fun,\nand I\u2019m not saying, \u201cBlink 182 are\nfun,\u201d I am saying this is uplifting\nand feel-good in a non-guilty way.\nFor those who would call me\npretentious for liking this, I can\u2019t\nemphasise just how much fun this\nalbum is. It is not miserable fluff\nlike so much rubbish around at the\nminute, it is a load of friends digging deep, strapping their guitars\non and making essential music.\nSo for those who did not know, fun\nis two drummers and a huge horn\nsection.\nMatty Hoban\nDo Make Say Think\nYou, You\u2019re A History In Rust\n(Constellation Records)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nalbum review\nThe Shins\nWincing The Night Away\n(Transgressive Records)\n\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\u2729\nThe Shins are an odd lot, in these\ntimes of every group having a hook,\nor as Mark Thompson would say, an\n'ident', it is unusal to come across\nsuch an oustandinly bland band.\nWincing The Night Away is The\nShins third release distributed by\nthe hip Transgressive Records la-bel, in a roster including Lady Fuzz\nand the equally dull Young Knives.\nAll the same listening to the album\nis not offensive either and is best\ndescribed as a dull sunday morning\n\u2013 where the Velvet Underground\nwould be classed as the good\nversion.\nTracks like Red Rabbit drag on,\nthe cheery vocal sound of James\nMercer is marred by a droll set of\nlyrics and a group behind him who\nsound like a band of hippies who\nhave only just been able to afford all\nthe milky delay pedals they had wet\ndreams about. The result? The album has no punch or feel, the bassist should have just not bothered,\nthe drummer makes a drum machine have groove and the guitarist,\nwell we have already covered them.\nThe album seems 20 years too late,\nthe jangly prog approach apparently wooed critics when the Shins debuted but why have some modern\nattempt when you can pick up the\nreal deal? In truth some people will\nlike this album, those mellow, pubic\nhair combing, merkin knitters will\nprobably drive Prius hybrid cars,\nsmell there own farts and talk with\ntheir eyes closed they are so smug.\nNick Simpson\nalbum review\nDo Make Say Think in their natural abode: the house of Jazz\n(Insert sexual innuendo in the form of a riding joke here): The Shins\n10 Friday 9 February 2007\neviews\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfelix\nR\n\n"

However, Ms Rahman\u2019s late arrival to the important\nSEC (Strategic Education Committee) meeting, where she had been\ndue to give a presentation about the\nPhD funding increase (which was\nlater made by Ben Harris), and a\nfailure to submit the GSA budget on\ntime, both occured after the no confidence motion had been submitted.\nMany of those present commented\nto Felix that this showed a lack of\nregard for her current situation.\nMs Rahman had many explanations for her poor timekeeping and\nattendence, citing building works\nand illness as two, and was very\napologetic for some of the transgressions alleged in the paper, her\nvoice almost breaking at times.\nAs the meeting continued, the\nquestioning softened somewhat,\nwith Council acknowledging the\ngood work Ms Rahman has done in\norganising events for the fledgling\nGSA, and in promoting the GSA\nbrand to PGs. As such, Ben Harris\n(Deputy President, Education &\nWelfare) suggested a move to cen-sure, rather than no confidence.\nSeveral hawkish Council members seemed unhappy with this \u2013\none pointed out that this wasn\u2019t the\nfirst warning Ms Rahman has received (there have been some verbal warnings, and a written warn-ing), and that she had had enough\nchances.\nThe doves, however, argued that\nthe removal of Shama might signal\ndeath for the GSA, which has only\nexisted for two years. There were\nalso concerns expressed over what\nmessage such a move would send\nto the postgraduate student body.\nAfter an almost four hour meet-ing, the move to censure was approved by Council. Voting on the\ncensure took place by secret ballot;\nMs Rahman did not return to hear\nthe result.\nA number of Council members\napproached by Felix said they voted\nfor the move to censure as they felt\na no confidence motion would fall,\nleaving no official consequences.\nConcerns over the functioning of\nthe sabb team after censure seem,\nfor the moment, unfounded. John\nCollins commented: \u201cIt feels like a\ngreat dark cloud has been lifted.\u201d\nThe College email service had a\nbrief fit last Friday, spamming almost every student with old emails\nfrom mailing lists.\nThe emails were from student\nmailing lists used by Union Presidents, as well as Faculty Unionwide mailing lists and Collegewide lists They began arriving\nlate on Friday afternoon, causing\na number of students\u2019 inboxes to\noverflow. The messages were arriving from previous Union President,\nSameena Misbahuddin, previous\nCGCU President, Sid Singh, CGCU\nPresident James Fok, the Imperial\nCollege Health Centre, the Rector,\nSir Richard Sykes, and even the\ncurrent President, John Collins.\nThe emails concerned everything\nCollege email fault\n\u201cSystem error\u201d causes old emails to be resent to almost every\nstudent in the College, filling inboxes and raising tempers\nfrom last year\u2019s sabb elections to\nmumps, and some even covered\nlast year\u2019s NUS referendum.\nThe torrent of email trickled off\nby the end of the day, with only a\ntrickle of emails arriving in this\neditor\u2019s inbox by 10pm, including\ntwo messages about an entrepreneur\u2019s challenge, and one from Mr\nCollins.\nMr Collins has received \u201ca large\namount\u201d of angry emails from students who received his own emails,\npresuming him to be responsible.\nAn exasperated Mr Collins could be\nseen stalking the corridors of Beit\nTowers on Friday evening, unhappy that he\u2019d been given the blame\nunjustifiably.\nMr Collins also said ICT\u2019s conduct\nhad been less than satisfactory.

Outland not the nice place you\ncould go, but at least it not all clean\nlike those stone meatsack castles.\nOutland sandy, with rocks, like\nMama Vregdush make her soup.\nNogdush not sure why planet\nfloats in bits like that, or why people still like go there, but one thing\nNogdush does sure of is what\nmakes the ladies love Nogdush, and\nOutland skies are full of pretty stars\nand big planets that make Nogdush\nfeel sick.\nMaybe ladies like feel sick?\nNogdush not know, it not matter,\njust take lady on nice walk under\nstars and then leave sandy place\nfor better world with more eatable\nthings.\nWetlands might seem like smelly\nswamp place full of mud and bugs,\nand that because it is smelly swamp\nGal, you\u2019re my world (of Warcraft)\nEveryone\u2019s favourite green casanova Nogdush Vregdush provides tips to get the orc of your dreams\nShe look lonely, lost in wilderness, needing love-love, eh? That mean it problably okay to club her now\nplace. But Nogdush know that many\nlady like nature, and elfing not only\npeople that know what a flower is.\nNogdush eat many flowers, and like\nthem too. Some lady like looking at\nflower and tree, though, so try not\nto eat them all \u2013 Nogdush made\nthat mistake already! Eating mangrove tree not same as night at restaurant for first date.\nApparently.\nAnyway, wetland good in evening,\nwith moony-moon out and no-one\naround to see Nogdush show his\naxe. Next place please.\nDarnassus. Hmm. Nogdush not\nreally like the pointy-eared, tree-shooting catfacts, but he guess\nNight Elves doing something right\nbecause everygirl says Darnassus\nis pretty place. Nogdush not like\nit. Too much water. And where are\nspikes and red dust? Nogdush like\nspikes. It remind him of home, and\nchildhood.\nDarnassus okay for loving place. It\na bit like shopping centre \u2013 strange\nplants and silly water features, but\ngood place to pick up chicks if you\nnot like Nogdush and not have Orcish charm. It hard to get to, but\nno-one ever there and that mean\nplenty of places to sit and spit at\nfireflies.\nNo-one really like elfing. Darnassus just tourist place. Better place\nto go is Deeprun Tram.

Kelly on\na single album and still call it his\nown? Its the Snoop dee-ooh-double-gee of course!\nIt was over 10 years ago when Dre\nproduced Snoop's debut, Doggystyle \u2013 a record that has since gone\nquadruple platinum shifting over 6\nmillion units in the US of A alone.\nSince then the Dogg has had moderate sales, ever popularised by the\nwhite middle class of America who\nare responsible for the rise of NWA\nand gangsta rap in general. Touring on Lollopalooza and working\nalongside popstars such as Justin\nTimberlake and Pharrel, Snoop\nhas certainly being playing the\nPR game in the last few years although R&G still struggle to mimic\nanything like the success of his first\n1993 release.\nOpening with Intrology you soon\nrealise Snoop is back on top of the\ngame, oozing attitude before cascading into Think About It, one of\nthe few tracks on the album when\nSnoop flies solo. The album demon-The 1st of December, Christmas\non the way, term nearly over. Not a\nbad day all in all but just to add to\nit, Felix sent me to meet The View.\nSounds almost mystical in a way\nbut sadly it\u2019s not really, The View\nare a band from Dundee in Scotland, they play what you would normally call \u2018indie\u2019 music and they are\ngoing to be huge!\nAfter a wild goose chase to Camden, we meet up with Keiren (bass\nplayer and songwriter) in a Holiday\nInn at King\u2019s Cross. He starts by\nasking where we\u2019re from and after\nbeing told, politely declines being\nsent a copy of Felix.\nSo you\u2019re playing Brixton Academy tonight then? Looking forward\nto it?\nYeah, its Brixton academy [sic]\nman! Great venue.\nThere a couple of weeks ago\nweren\u2019t you? With The Fratellis?\nMmm, was good. We played in\nCardiff supporting peaches [sic],\nthen jumped in the van, drove from\nCardiff to Brixton. Supposed to be\nonstage at 11 and we showed up at\nfive too [sic], but when we went on\nstage it was great. There here [sic]\nloads of people there to see us an\n[sic] stuff.\nWell, we enjoyed it. Are you playing the Winter Wonderland shows\nfor Xfm?\nYeah up in Glasgow, it\u2019s [sic] that\nnot on Thursday?\nI have no idea man, your playing\nit, not me!\nYeah yeah, it\u2019s on Thursday.\nSo you\u2019re doing two nights at Brixton, then where are you off to?\nAstoria! Our headline show! Biggest headline show we\u2019ve done to\ndate, Sold out!\nWell you\u2019ve created quite a bit\nof hype, when did you sign with\n1965?\nFebruary or something, but we\nknew we were going to sign (with\nthem) before that. I think probably\nfrom fireworks night [sic] last year\nwe knew we were going to sign with\nJames (Endeacott, one of 1965s two\nowners, discoverer of the libertines,\nstrokes [sic], etc) but we never actually signed until just after we came\noff the Babyshambles tour.\nWe were a bit overwhelmed by\nthe fan-base you\u2019ve managed to\naccumulate when we last saw you\nat Brixton.\nYeah it was fuckin [sic] cool, we\ndidn\u2019t know what to expect having\nnever been to Brixton before. All\nthe carling academy\u2019s [sic] are sort\nof the same but that ones [sic] a\nbit different really. I mean just the\nchants, when we arrived it was all\nrun run run, an [sic] grabbing gui-tars. But you could hear [the crowd]\nchant, an it was great to jump on-stage. I can\u2019t wait to play it again to-night, a [sic] tomorrow will be better cause [sic] it\u2019s the last night of\nthe tour. It\u2019ll be messy tomorrow.\nWhen you signed with James (En-deacott) there were a couple of\nother labels after you I think, why\nchoose them?\nAye, aye there was. Met a guy\nfrom EMI, he was a tosser, and virgin [sic] too. James was the first\nout of any label to get in touch with\nus. Our manager had said that wed\n[sic] better start thinking about who\nwe wanted to sign with cause [sic]\nwe have different offers, an [sic] I\nwas thinking im [sic] just gonna\n[sic] sign with the 1st company that\ncomes along an [sic] gives you some\nmoney! But he pushed us to say so\nI said rough trade, id [sic] like to be\nwith rough trade [sic] which is who\nJames was with at the time. An\n[sic] then he left rough trade [sic]\nto start up 1965 so.\nHe flew up to come to a gig in\nDundee, loved in [sic] an [sic] partied all night long then went back\ndown to London the next day. We\nhad a gig in Glasgow the next night,\nand he fuckin [sic] flew back up\nagain met with us there and was\nlike \u2018surprise!\u2019 an [sic] like pogo-ing at the front of the gig. The guy\nfrom virgin [sic] was like \u2018I signed\nthe kooks\u2019 [sic] that was the end of\nthat!\nAbout a year ago I think you had\na small EP out with a local label in\nDundee?\nYeah our manager runs a really\nsmall label, I think that ep [sic] is\nall they\u2019ve ever released. Came out\nin January.\nThat was just when you were playing The Doghouse (small venue in\nthe middle of Dundee) wasn\u2019t it?\nYeah just The Doghouse and a couple of local pubs and stuff.\nThere a few crazy stories about\nwhy you were thrown out of the\nfirst pub you wrote and practiced\nin, the Bay View I think?\nIt just got a bit outta [sic] hand, Kyle\n(lead signer) his cousin owned it an\n[sic] was just as much of a nutter as\nme an [sic] Kyle about the band. An\n[sic] we used to just sit up and drink\nthe place dry. I mean there\u2019s a story\nabout us driving a scooter along the\nbar, but its [sic] wasn\u2019t a fuckin [sic]\nHarley Davidson, it was just one of\nthem push scooters we went along\non and jumped onto the dance floor!\nIt was mainly cause [sic] we kept\nstealing drink that we got chucked\nout.\nYou were originally a cover band I\nthink weren\u2019t you?\nYeah we were, but we stopped doing that when we were seventeen.\nWe used to play caravan parks for\nmoney, it was quite cool.\nWhat kind of stuff did you play?\nAbout sixty percent of the set was\noasis [sic] songs an [sic] the rest\nwas kina [sic] split between t-rex\n[sic] and the Beatles\nYou were in town last night. Get\nup to anything much?\nWe were playing with Babyshambles last night (at one of the anti\nracism gigs) it was really funny.\nThere\u2019s was [sic] no sound check\nor anything, typical shambles [sic]\ngig.\nHow long you been touring with\nPrimal Scream now?\nBout [sic] 3 weeks ago, 17 dates.\nYou\u2019ve got the album coming out\nin the new year sometime? All\nrecorded?\n25th of January its [sic] coming\nout I think, its [sic] all recorded an\n[sic] mixed were just trying to get\nthe artwork an [sic] stuff right. I\u2019m\nfuckin [sic] ecstatic with it man\nGoing straight onto the album\ntour when that\u2019s out? Or are you\nhaving a break?\nWe'll not get a break, I was under\nthe impression we were getting one\nover Christmas but we only have\nthe 22nd and the 25th off! An [sic]\nthen on the 1st of January were going to America an to Japan in a few\nweeks.\nHave you done any overseas gigs\nbefore?\nWe did a festival in Italy over the\nsummer and we did Ibiza rocks.\nThat was fuckin [sic] great man. Its\n[sic] like a big pub but it don\u2019t [sic]\nhave any roof on it or anything! An\n[sic] the backstage areas is up a\nlevel an [sic] right on Santonio bay.\nYou can watch the sunset while\nhaving a drink! Their trying to cash\nin on the indie bands over there, but\nthieve [sic] still got a dance attitude\nto it, the [sic] don\u2019t get the whole\nthing. Their [sic] putting loads of\ndancers in bikinis on stage with us,\nthey've no idea what to do!\nWhat was it like working with\nDefinitely Maybe producer, Owen\nMorris?\nAh, its fuckin [sic] great man.\nOwens [sic] like my mate now. He\u2019s\njust mental to work with. Defiantly\n[sic] the craziest person I know.\nJust after we finished recording we\nwent for a drive in a field in his jag\nto see what it sounded like. An he\u2019s\nlike \u2018you drive, you drive, chase that\nrabbit\u2019 an [sic] as we where [sic]\nchasing it the bumpers fell off, then\ndriving home it broke down, something had happened to the engine\nan [sic] it was a write off. His wife\ncame out on the last day an [sic]\nwent mental cause he\u2019d obviously\nblamed it all on me.\nAt this point Keiren leaves to attend\nthe night\u2019s sound-check, a novel\nexperience for him at the Brixton\nAcademy. So, having no more band\nmembers to interview, we depart.\nThe View played that evening to a\ncrowd who already knew them despite the lack of released material\nand the fact that everyone there\nshould have been there to see Primal Scream.\nThey play songs that make you\nwant to dance and sing along, while\nthat\u2019s not particularly unusual for\nme, it seemed that many people felt\nthe same way. Minor technical difficulties were experienced for a good\n20 minutes however, but unfazed by\nroadies running left, right and centre they pulled through to finish the\nset.\nAll I\u2019m going to say to you now is\nthis: the album Hats Off The Buskers comes out on the 22nd of January, if you do not own it by the 23rd\nyou will already have missed out on\nsomething.\nSam Lombard\nRichard Ware\nA view to an inter-view: The View interview\nArmed with his acoustic bass guitar and some of the freshest, sharp-est, most observant lyrics around at\nthe moment Jamie T has managed\nto combine elements from a wide\nrange of genres. Fusing funk, hip-hop, punk and reggae he manages\nto create a fairly unique sound, at\nleast in the more commercial music scene, that will only help to cement this young man into the British music scene.\nLyrically speaking Jamie T takes\nhis inspiration from his surroundings of grimy London bringing in\naspects of teenage life in London\nto most of his songs such as Sheila\nand XXX. Discussion of teenage\nlife is something Jamie T certainly\ndoesn't shy away speaking openly\nabout girls finding love behind\nthe bike-shed and drunken bar\nfights doesn't seem to phase this\nyoungster.\nSpeaking volumes about teenage\nlife in Britain Panic Prevention will\nno doubt strike a chord with it's intended audience across the country\nalmost certainly making it a huge\nseller.\nTom Whitson\nalbum review\nstrates the high production values\nof R&G along with the classic rap\nalbum structure. That's That Shit\nfeat. R. Kelly covers smooth 'titty\nstyle' content while Gangbangn 101\nis clearly the uzi spraying niggaz\ntrack of the album.\nPast this, there is not much to say\nabout this album, it is generic but\nfresh, it doesn't step on the toes of\nanything before but then again it\ndoesn't push the boundaries of the\ngenre either \u2013 Tha Blue Carpet\nTreatment offers good entertain-ment, but don't expect the world.\nNick Simpson\nJamie T looking down at you, you worthless worm\n11\nfelix\nFriday 9 February 2007\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

They\u2019ve only got 5,000 pre-or-ders available to fill at the moment,\nbut they\u2019re excited to be able to offer them to gamers.\nThe downside, of course, is that\nit requires you to buy a PSP alongside it, and the entire package sets\nyou back nearly \u00a3700. This news\nwas announced at the weekend just\nas analysts forecast price drops in\nthe US because of poor sales. God\nknows what HMV are trying to do,\nbut we\u2019re unsure it\u2019s going to be all\nthat successful.\nThankfully,thePCmarketismuch\ncalmer, with the release of Windows\nVista making things calm, peaceful,\nand inducing a trance-like loving\nmood amongst all of PC-kind.\nAh. Well, it did for a little while,\nanyway. The box looked nice, the\nfeatures looked shiny, but before\nyou know it the internet is exploding and lawsuits are flying.\nAt the time of going to press,\nnVidia are still under the threat of\nlegal action after failing to provide\nadequate support for Vista. After\nan update of their drivers failed to\nprovide any for the new operating\nsystem, several lawsuits were allegedly filed against them, though\nsupport has since been promised.\nSee www. nvidiaclassaction.org for\nmore information.\nBut class action lawsuits are a\nsmall distraction compared to the\nclaim that nine out of ten PC games\nfrom the pre-Vista era will refuse\nto run on Microsoft\u2019s latest. Despite claims of new hardware being\n\u2018Vista Ready\u2019 and various software\nsolutions having been in place for\nmonths prior to beta testing, a major game publisher claimed that\ndue to botched digital rights man-agement, and complex attempts\nat keeping system security, most\ngames will be rendered unplayable\non the next-generation OS.\nAs an example, the ESRB ratings protection that has been built\ninto Vista was cited as another example of badly-implemented \u2018user\nprotection\u2019. The system, supposed\nto allow parents to set levels of\ngames that can be played on children\u2019s accounts, hasn\u2019t been fully\nimplemented across the gaming\nworld, meaning that almost every\ninternet-based game is blocked by\nthe technology, regardless of the\nrating level set. Obtaining ESRB\nStuffed toys, chocolate, and the 2007\u2019s first releases. It\u2019ll all be over by Christmas\nrating for a single game costs $2500\n\u2013 not something that the average\ninternet developer is going to be attempting any time soon.\nThe dust is still settling on the re-lease, and problems were expected\nwith a software leap of this magni-tude. But with Gates\u2019 dream of an\nintegrated 360 and PC platform riding on the success of Vista, it seems\nthat Nintendo are the only ones\nhaving a good week.\nIt\u2019s been a slow January, but it\nseems like publishers have realised that the New Year has begun\nand finally decided to start throwing some games out. First up on the\nrecommendations list for this week\nis the brilliant Okami for the Playstation2 \u2013 a weird yet wonderful\ngame with beautiful visuals and a\nstrange platforming-cum-rhythm-action hook.\nEvery Extend Extra and Bomberman arrive on the PSP if you\u2019re looking for a quick distraction over the\nLove Season, or there\u2019s the more\nengaging Battlestations:Midway, a\ntour of the great naval and aerial\nbattles of World War 2, out on XBox\n360 and PC. The month is looking to\nbe a good one, with Supreme ComLove, yesterday. This was going to be a dig at geeks, until we realised he\u2019s wearing a FireFox tee.

    "content": "RSM Hockey tour of Holland\n27\nfelix\nFriday 9 February 2007\nSPORT sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday, January the 19th\nsaw the\nRSM mixed hockey assembled at\nStanstead airport as ready as they\never would be for their tour to Holland. It would prove to be one hell of\na trip! With hockey high on the list of\nsports played by the Dutch(second\nonly to football), we were under no\nillusions that the game would be an\neasy one.\nUnder the watchful eyes of Sam\nand Sammy we found our way to\nthe hostel and the following day to\nthe playing grounds known as the\nLiedseplene. We had all made our\nown preparations and run through\nset pieces including the bubble\ngum and haze moves ready to face\nThe Bulldogs.\nIt was a shaky start for Steve and\nKate, being new to the sport; But\nthey found their legs quickly while\nthe old hands Mikey and Charlotte\ndrove forwards and set the pace.\nWe were unlucky not to score\nearly on considering the territory\nwe had over the opposition. Ben\nstarted to regret that ridiculously\nover-sized Burger King the night\nbefore \u2013 but only briefly judging by\nthe equally large meal consumed\npost match.\nUnfortunately after the initial\nforward drive, the Dutch picked up\ntheir game in a way that suggested\nsome sort of stimulating drugs.\nJust 15 mins in, a goal was slipped\ndespite Kieran\u2019s best efforts in goal\nand Ally\u2019s impressive determination in defence.\nThis set back caused a few of the\nRSM to let their chins drop at first\nbut Alice made the call to look back\nup and restart the drive. It was a difficult few minutes but Tim made a\nRSM Hockey in cup semi-final for the first time\nMen\u2019s Hockey\nBarts London 2nd XI 1\nRSM 1st XI 4\nRSM 1st XI 2\nSt.George\u2019s 2nd XI 2\n(5 - 4 after penalties)\nRSM have progressed to the semifinal stage of the ULU Men\u2019s Reserve Cup for the first time in bloody\nages, thanks to two stunning victories against those unpleasant viral\noutbreaks known as \u2018medics\u2019. Following our league success against\nBarts 3rds the same week, the gentlemen\u2019s club that is RSM Hockey\nwent into the first round full of confidence (and port). The addition of\nRichie D to the side meant the midfield resembled that of a World XI,\nwith star players from across the\ncountry coming together in an orgy\nof hockey brilliance.\nBarts 2nds could only stand and\nwatch in awe as silky interchanging\nplay, \u2018sixth sense\u2019 movement off the\nball and Ben\u2019s charging runs down\nthe left wing tore their defence to\npieces, and 28 microseconds into\nthe game Leon scored off a perfect-ly-executed short corner routine.\nMore was to come as consistent and\nunrelenting pressure lead to corner after corner, and when Mikey\nflicked the ball over a stranded\nkeeper the Miners began to sense\nthat victory would surely be theirs.\nHowever, to Barts\u2019 credit they managed to earn a shortie of their own,\nand (mostly out of compassion) we\nconceded. This was to be Kiran\u2019s\nonly lapse in a come-back performance that Wilko himself would have\nbeen proud of. The second half saw\nmore great work from a dynamic\ndefence, well-oiled midfield and aggressive attack; Tim fired a free hit\nin for Leon to deflect through the\nkeeper\u2019s legs, and Mikey put Barts\u2019\nCup hopes to death with a fourth.\nCue post-match celebrations, more\nport, streaking, and a few tears\nfrom the Barts captain.\nAnother week, another round,\nand RSM found themselves up\nagainst an in-form George\u2019s side -unfortunately, a little too much fun\nthe night before meant that RSM\ndefence lacked its usual finesse,\nand Tom seemed to play the first\nhalf for the wrong team.\nMan of the Match, Jackson, held\nthings together, and we were fortunate to concede just two soft first-half goals. A half-time half-bottle of\nport sorted Tom out a treat, and a\nrousing (arousing?) team talk from\nEl Capitan put the fire back into\nthe side. Timmaay slotted the first\nin from a short, and Sam \u2018thieving\nbastard\u2019 Lloyd latched onto a shot\nfrom TFC to square things up. A\nfew frantic minutes in our own D\nkept the game alive as the whistle\nblew for full time, and the supporters nearly wet themselves with excitement at the prospect of a penalty shoot-out.\nCaptain\u2019s first choice was Mikey\n(who, given his previous record for\nCup flicks, probably wasn\u2019t such a\ngood idea), followed by Tom, Pete,\nSam, and The Great Man Himself.\nMikey duly lived up to his reputation\nby putting his shot so wide it nearly\nreached the sideline. Ade in goal did\nus proud with some fine saves, but\nafter five each the scores were tied\nat two apiece. The tension mounted\nas the shoot-out entered the sudden death stage. Mikey fluffed his\nsecond attempt but sent the keeper\nthe wrong way and got it on target;\nthe crowd went wild as it trickled\nover the line. Tom and Pete had no\nsuch trouble and Grobbelaar-like\ndistraction tactics by Ade ensured\nthat the opposition Captain cracked\nunder the pressure. Hail Victory\nand look forward to more enticing\nCup action on February 18th!\nSpecial thanks to new guys Adam\nand Steve, Ben and Tom for making\nthe effort, Pikey for playing with a\nbroken wrist, Pikey for not playing\nwith a broken ankle, Pete for travelling down especially, etc., etc., you\nknow who you all are.\n8 people standing, 1 person flying? 8 people flying, 1 person standing? I just can\u2019t understand the orientation of that photo on the right\nBeyonc\u00e9\nBen Gates\nbreak up the right wing leaving the\nground behind him smoking; RSM\nwere back in the opposition\u2019s half.\nAfter much vocal activity from forwards Katie and Elly, the ball was in\nscoring territory and with some of\nthe best support seen all weekend,\nMikey was able to roll a beautiful\none in at the back post.\nThe rest of the half saw some\ngood play from everyone but no\nmore joy was seen. Going in at half\ntime drawing one all, we were in\nrelatively high spirits. As we all took\non water during the break, Ben and\nElly decided that in the absence of\norange wedges, which Susie bluntly\ndescribed as \u201cf***ing disgraceful\u201d,\nbananas were clearly the way to\nmotor forward.\nAs the second half began the girls\nfound a seemingly magical hole in\nthe defence and tunnel vision en-sued. This focus resulted in Pete\ngetting a screamer in the top corner as if that white ball was drawn\nin by gravity. Once again Charlotte\nmade a push forward, setting the\nstandard with a long sprint, the type\nwhich makes you feel like you\u2019re going to vomit. A quick one-two with\nKatie resulted in our third goal and\nAlly kindly fetched the tired Charlotte some water.\nThe Dutch team were obviously\nstarting to lose faith in themselves\nwith silly mistakes becoming common unfortunately RSM\u2019s lack of\nfitness meant we were unable to\nscore again. Still, when the final\nwhistle went we were the victors; 3\npoints to 1.\nAchieving this result in a foreign\ncountry where the RSM is almost\nunknown means we will be proud\nfor years to come.\nThe only appropriate way to celebrate the victory was, of course,\nin the \u201ctraditional\u201d RSM manner-getting wasted and \u201cdrinking\u201d lots\nof \u201ccoffee\u201d... or something like that\nanyway.\nHurrah for team photographs! Good ol\u2019 dependable hockey teams. You can write in again\n\n"

The extra saddle on\nyour steed? We can see it, we know\nit\u2019s a cry for help.\nBut then there are the gamers\nwho\u2019ve already found love. They\u2019ve\ngot their party formed and locked,\nthey\u2019ve found their henchman,\nPlayer 2 has entered the game. And\nso on, and other slightly strange\nmetaphors.\nWhether it\u2019s Lara Croft or the\ngirl who\u2019s always late to Monday\nafternoon lectures, everyone needs\nsome love on Valentine\u2019s day.\nSo here\u2019s our complete guide to a\nperfect day of love. If you\u2019re in the\nmood for something more virtual,\nwe\u2019ve got that covered, too, with\na tour of World of Warcraft\u2019s most\nromantic locations, just over the\npage.\nBut for now, it\u2019s time for gaming\nto show it\u2019s pinker side, as Felix\nGames delves into the murk and\nbrings you the lovey-dovey centre hiding behind the geek facade.\nWe\u2019re all traditional romantics at\nheart, really.\nHey, will j00 b3 my V4l3nt1n3?\nMy darling reader; Roses are red, violets are blue, all of my base, are belong to you. Make your love\nNick Virago\nA\ns everyone knows, the\nbasics for Valentine\u2019s\nday are simple \u2013 choco-late, a card, and something romantic. Since\nthe average gamer has spent all\ntoo much free time collecting coins,\nhostages and small fruits, we\u2019re\nsure that a little searching should\nbe no trouble for you.\nFirst you\u2019ll want some kind of sickly sweet-based gift. Heart-shaped\nchocolates are boring, what girls really want is for you to show just how\nseasoned a gamer you are, so head\non over to StrapYa! and you\u2019ll find\na delightful set of Mario figurines,\nsome with chocolate inside mystery\nboxes, some with sound effects that\nplay when you tap them, some with\nhallucinatory drugs hidden in small\ncompartments. All cute enough to\ngive to your special someone.\nThen there\u2019s the card. Naturally,\nyou could make your own. But let\u2019s\nface it, you probably don\u2019t have the\ntime, and your colouring skills sort\nof hit a peak in Year 4. The next best\nbet\u2019s a Hallmark job, but... well...\nit\u2019s a little impersonal, and it just\ndoesn\u2019t say \u2018leet\u2019 enough. Right?\nRight.\nFelix has this one sorted for you,\nhowever, as we pioneer the Videogame Valentine\u2019s Card. Grab it from\nour Flickr (http://flickr.com/pho-tos/felixgames), and do with as you\nwish. Pure romantic genius, you\u2019re\nwell on your way to getting some\nco-op action.\nNow you\u2019ve got the giveables,\nit\u2019s time to take the romantics up\na notch. We all know about looking\nsmart, washing the hair and what-ever, but what really impresses people on a day about love is dressing\nup as characters from Mario Bros.\nEssentially, it\u2019s the Pride and\nPrejudice of our day. Mario \u2013 a\ndown-and-out plumber with a dysfunctional brother and edible\nfriends \u2013 seeks to save the pure\nIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re against fun trinkets. It\u2019s just the \u2018sweets\u2019 inside look a lot like smuggled ecstasy tablets\nPrincess Peach from the tyrrany\nof a giant turtle. If you can\u2019t see the\nmetaphors in that, then there\u2019s no\nhope for you. It\u2019s a timeless love\nstory wrapped up in a narrative\nthat mainly involves Freudian pipe-sliding and eating mushrooms.\nWith that in mind, you\u2019ll want to\ntake a look at sites such as PinUpGirl in order to look the part when\nyou give your gifts to love interest\ncome the big day. Moustache optional for the Princess Peach outfit,\nof course, but you might like to add\nit in anyway to really mix things up.\nAlright, you look the part and your\ninventory is full to bursting with fire\nflowers. Time to get some events\norganised. Here\u2019s the tricky bit \u2013 instinct tells you to try dinner, long\nwalks and possibly some kind of\ncultural event. Sure, instinct served\nyou well on de_dust last Thursday\nevening, but instinct when it comes\nto love is just no use at all.\nTwo words \u2013 multiplayer gaming.\nIt\u2019s essentially a one-way ticket\nto the High Score screen. Open up\nwith a heartfelt rendition of \u201cTonight I\u2019m Gonna Rock You Tonight\u201d\non Guitar Hero, just to get everyone in the mood, before settling\ndown to get a good few hours in\non Final Fantasy IX co-op, maybe\nfinishing up with a whirlwind tour\nof Azeroth (see, \u201cYou\u2019re My World\n(Of Warcraft)\u201d for the quick guide)\nbefore proclaiming your love to the\nmounrful OST of Ico.\nIf that doesn\u2019t get you a well-earned boss battle in the bedroom,\nthen you\u2019ve obviously not followed\nour advice closely enough.\nOf course, not everyone\u2019s lucky\nenough to have an extra controller\nthis Valentine\u2019s, so if you\u2019re stuck\nwith just the AI (we\u2019re not sure\nwhere this metaphor\u2019s gone now\n\u2013 is that pornography? I don\u2019t know\nwho I am.) then that\u2019s okay too\n\u2013 there\u2019s always a way out.\nNaturally, it\u2019ll be easier if you\u2019re\nbased in Japan, the centre of the\ntacky soft-porn world.\nFirst off, how about a dating simu-lator? Sure, there are a lot on that\nwebsite you \u2018accidentally\u2019 stumbled\nacross whilst \u2018researching\u2019 about\n\u2018Japanese culture\u2019, but this is 2007\nnow, and it\u2019s fine with everyone\nif you want to delve into some obscure Eastern niche genre.\nOur pick has to be the soon-to-be-released LOVE x2 KISS, for the\nPSP\n, which will take you and your\ncompletely fictional girlfriend on a\nholiday to the States, where you\u2019ll\nhave to make a series of decisions\ncorrectly in order to please the lady\nof your dreams. It\u2019s just like being\nin a real relationship! Except with\nthe game, you can remember which\nanswers were wrong for next time.\nDon\u2019t get us wrong, we\u2019ve got\ntouch-screen Hentai games for\nthe DS and a quite frankly bizarre\nmaid-management simulator for\nthe mobile. But we understand if\nyou feel a bit too sordid.\nBecause at the end of the day, the\nonly decent way to escape the terror of Valentine\u2019s day is to escape to\na happier place, and there\u2019s no happier than the country that spawned\na mushroom-eating Italian who\nonly sees in primary colours.\nThe Orient holds a many kitsch\ndelights, if you know where to\nlook. Cosplay caf\u00e9s and hotels with\nMaids dressed up as the most minor of minor characters from every\nanime and mecha-game under the\nRising Sun, or just a simple Love\nHotel that\u2019s been souped up with\nrentable Playstation3s.\nWhatever approach you take this\nFebruary, just remember that it\u2019s\nnot just about chocolate and roses.\nSo if it comes to the evening of Valentine\u2019s Day, and after it\u2019s all over\nyou find that it\u2019s not working out between you and that girl that seemed\nso perfect not that long ago, remember that you knew Tomb Raider\nwas going to go downhill when you\nbought Legends. Serves you right.\nSee? It\u2019s not all guns and women in ridiculous clothing and stereotypes. We can be romantic, too, you shits\n20 felix Friday 9 February 2007\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Wielding the\nmighty organ\nT\nhis week has seen the first censure\nagainst a sabbatical officer for more\nthan twenty years. In a draining four\nhour Council meeting, we sat and listened to accusation, counter-accusa-tion, defences, apologies, and what\nsome present termed \u201cuntruths\u201d. We\ndebated, calmly and coolly (for the\nmost part), on an elected officer\u2019s conduct.\nThough I\u2019m sure the vast majority of the student population couldn\u2019t give a flying fuck, it was actually an important moment. No longer could sabbaticals sit in their\nrosy little tower, safe from harm no matter how inept\nthey may be (a certain ex-DPGS springs to mind). John\nCollins may have bleated in his governance review (no\nmore!) about holding officers to account, but Monday\nwas proof that this year\u2019s sabbaticals and other officers\nare willing to take the steps necessary to prevent another Luis Hui (oops, named him) situation developing.\nIn Shama\u2019s defence, however, she spoke well and confidently despite what must have been a harrowing \u2018trial\u2019,\nbut often refused to accept what seemed to be indefensible points from the floor, earning her little respect from\nsome present. Certain thorny topics, notably attendence\nand her (dis)appearance at Freshers\u2019 Fair, may have\nturned many volunteer officers, who sacrifice a great\ndeal of time for very little thanks, against her.\nAs far as I can see, the furore over the bars appears to\nhave died down; it seems no-one took issue with John\nCollins\u2019 reply to Mez and Jess\u2019 article last week. Either\nthat, or you\u2019ve simply stopped caring.\nIt\u2019s elections time again, as I mentioned a couple of\nweeks ago. This is now less a call for people to stand,\nand more a call for thinking before voting. I know that\nyou may feel compelled to vote for a candidate you know,\nbut that is a terrible reason to elect someone to an office\nwhere they have significant power.\nInstead, look at the candidate\u2019s record. If a person has\nzero experience with clubs, will they make a good Deputy President (Clubs & Societies), for example? Though\nmany people imagine the sabbs to be ineffectual, pointless positions, and a waste of Union money, in day-to-day\nbusiness they are incredibly vital, dealing with the cri-sises that arise almost daily. If you elect someone with\nno experience, how can you be sure they\u2019ll do a good\njob? If someone has spent four years as a club chair,\nthen you can be sure they have a good understanding of\nhow clubs work.\nAnd don\u2019t take the \u201cthat\u2019s what training is for\u201d line,\nas one of my opponents did when I was elected. Just\nlike driving and sex, I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no subsitute for\nexperience.\nRight, I\u2019m off to the bar.

Do\nindividuals shape society\u2019s beliefs and\nactions, or does society shape individual\u2019s beliefs and actions? Why does it\nmatter you may ask?\nImagine a situation where you have\nbeen accused of a crime you did not\ncommit. Now imagine that there is no\nevidence, circumstantial or otherwise,\nto back your case. If found guilty, you are\nlikely to face life in jail. Would you accept\ndefeat? Equally important, would you\nwant those who believed in you to give\nup? Now imagine if you may, injustices\nhappening millions, no billions of times\nover... Injustice in pay, social exclusion,\ndamage to the environment, human\nrights violations... Would you rather be\nthe passive on-looker or the active advocate of justice and truth?\nNo, you do not need to go on street\nprotests, chain yourself to fences or\nhug a tree to be an active advocate of\njustice (unless that is something you\u2019re\ninto of course, in which case you may\ncontinue to do so). You can follow an\nethical career that allows you to address environmental and social issues\nboth locally and on a global scale. On\nthe 21st of February, there will be an\nethical careers exhibition here at Imperial, which will allow you to discover\nthe potential that you are able to offer\nas an individual.\nThe idea of an ethical lifestyle often\nconjures the images of consuming fair\ntrade coffee or chocolate and wearing\norganic cotton shirts. However, the\npossibilities to make a visible difference are endless. Ethical careers can\nbe as viable in law, media, social devel-opment, government, engineering, enterprise and many more sectors. It is a\ncommon misconception that an ethical\ncareer will pay less, when in fact, such\njobs can be just as rewarding financially\nand even more so morally.\nAdditionally, the culture within your\nworkplace is more likely to be friendly\nand open due to the nature of your job\nand like-minded collegues.\nUltimately, choosing an ethical career\nis about choosing to be an active proponent of justice. You may not be the person who saves 800 million people from\ngoing hungry every day, but at the very\nleast, you have realised that society is\nshaped by individuals and it is the individual choice that you make, which\nwill lead to change and improvement\nworldwide.\nMissives directed to the editor\nThe Ethical Careers Exhibition will\nbe held on Wednesday 21st February, 11:30am-4:00pm, The\nGreat Hall: http://www.union.\nic.ac.uk/ethicalcareersexhibition/\nSir,\nOne has to wonder whether Adil Hussein actually conducted any research\nbefore writing last Friday\u2019s article. If\nso, he would have found that, regretta-bly, there *are* a great number of individuals and organisations calling for a\nSharia state in Britain. This is shown by\npolls and research across the political\nspectrum, from the Guardian to the Policy Institute (neither of which can reasonably be dismissed as obscure). This\nfact should worry both secular Muslims\nand non-Muslims alike, but cannot be\ntackled by pretending that the problem\n(and it *is* undoubtedly a problem for\nanyone concerned with our social cohe-sion) does not exist.\nYours faithfully,\nAnon\n[Please note that I am at Imperial but\nwould prefer to remain anonymous\nbecause, regrettably, even comments\nsuch as the above - which are intended\nto be a rational contribution to a very\nimportant debate - have had a tendency to be misconstrued by a small\nminority].\nGuess who?\nOutraged of\nTunbridge Wells\nSir,\nI would like to express my outrage (par-ticularly in response to the letter from\nthe \u201cguys at office 307a\u201d and the reply\nfrom a certain \u201cpornographer-in-chief\u201d)\nover the current state of Felix\u2019s Page 3.\nFelix Page 3 was revolutionary when it\nbegan! No matter how ugly, pretty, fat\nor thin, male or female, as long as you\ncould take off your clothes for the visual\nenjoyment of the rest of us, it was all to\nthe good. No more! For the last three\nissues, Felix has featured ACTUALLY\nATTRACTIVE PEOPLE! I ask you,\nwhat is going on??? Before, Page 3 was\na wonderfully democratic and enjoyable\ndig at the real porn industry. But now\nactually pretty girls (not even naked I\nadd) drape themselves across our page\nin the manner of a lingerie advert, reinforcing all the negative connotations\nthat the original Page 3 so successfully\nmocked.\nSociety degrades and sexualises\nwomen enough as it is; these values\nare not something that a student paper should endorse. The real pleasure\nof the old page three was its message\nthat anyone could be sexy. Now we\nhave reverted to the old, depressing\nview that impossibly beautiful women\nshould take off their clothes for the\nbase gratification of men such as \u201cthe\nguys at office 307a\u201d and some arrogant\ntwerp who seeks only \u201cthe most beautiful models\u201d for his centre spread.\nWhat a waste of a genuinely original\nand groundbreaking idea.\nDisappointed,\nMs Frances Smith\nAndy Sykes replies:\nAh, our first serious complaint about\npage 3!\nThough the points you make a val-id, you\u2019ve taken the comment made\nin the paper a little too serious. That\nwas written by me, and as a tongue-in-cheek statement (and written about\nten minutes before deadline).\nThe truth of the matter is that we\u2019re\nas democratic as ever - see the first\nRiding Club page 3 for an example of\npeople who aren\u2019t \u201cconventionally\u201d\nbeautiful. We will take anyone who\nwishes to be naked, and portray them\nin the best possible light. You wouldn\u2019t\nask us to make them look bad, would\nyou?\nJust to reiterate the point; we will\ntake anyone. The photographer this\nyear is very talented, and uses both his\nlighting and his make-up artist friend\nto make the people look as lovely as\npossible, more for their benefit (isn\u2019t\nit a good feeling to have photos where\nyou look good?) than for our readership\u2019s benefit.\nThey\u2019re not supposed to be degrad-ing, or only focussed on women. The\ntruth is we\u2019ve taken everyone who has\napplied so far this year; we\u2019ve even\nhad to run stock photos because noone was applying. We\u2019ve had no males\napply yet, though we\u2019re promised one\nfrom the rugby lads (as is traditional).\nI\u2019m sorry you took the comment to be\noffensive; it certainly wasn\u2019t meant to\nbe.\nAnd lastly, I had complaints when\nI removed the centrefold (because I\nwanted to... improve the tone of Felix, I\nthink), and I have received complaints\nnow I\u2019ve bowed to public pressure and\nreinstated it. You can\u2019t win, eh?\nSir,\nI have an idea for you:\nHow about an investigation into how\ngreen imperial college is. I am sick to\ndeath of reading all these proclamations on the IC website and in the reporter staff paper, about how we are at\nthe forefront of environmental science\netc. In reality, there is barely any recycling facilities on campus, and energy\nwaste is astronomical. I work at the\ncharing cross campus and we have to\ndo our own recycling and take it to the\npublic bins.\nImperial should be setting the gold\nstandards. Do we even have an environmental policy. Are all the new glass\nbuildings environmentally sound? Do\nany new developments incorporate solar panels, wind turbines etc. Do on site\nfranchises have to adhere to environmental policies?\nYours faithfully,\nJack Kerr\nImperial College is\ngreen? I think not\nAndy Sykes replies:\nYou know, I was just thinking about\nthis. While touring the campus distributing this mighty organ with a young\nAmerican acquaintance of the female\nvariety, she happened to comment on\nthe dearth of recycling bins around the\nCollege. It seems that with Green Week\napproaching, now would be the time to\nask what College is doing.\n5\nfelix\nFriday 9 February 2007\nCOMMENT & OPINION comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "The fairytale of frustrated love\nThe Royal Ballet\u2019s performance is sold out but Felix managed to catch a look at this most famous of ballets\n12 felix Friday 9 February 2007\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSwan Lake\nRoyal Ballet at\nThe Royal Opera House\nUntil February 27th\nDay seats only\nArt for the masses at the NG\nClaude Monet The Beach at Trouville, 1870\n\u00a9 The National Gallery, London\nI realised, not very long ago, that\nyou don\u2019t really go to see Swan Lake\nfor the story \u2013 it is, after all a fairly\nsimple fairytale: \u2018Once upon a time,\nthere was a Prince, he was sad and\nunfulfilled, he meets a mysterious\nPrincess who is also sad and unful-filled, he vows eternal love, he accidentally breaks this vow, Prince\nand Princess commit suicide and\nlive happily ever after in the afterlife\u2019. It reads like a somewhat macabre horoscope. No, you go to see\nSwan Lake for the dancing and the\nmusic, and you won\u2019t be disappointed at all by what\u2019s on offer from the\nRoyal Ballet in its current run of\nperformances.\nOn opening night, Roberta Marquez and Ivan Putrov danced the\nroles of Odette/Odile and Prince\nSiegfried beautifully. Ivan Putrov is\na very young Prince, not so much\nmelancholy as a rich boy who has\nnot yet found much in life, but wonderfully attentive and enamoured of\nOdette, endearingly earnest in his\ndeclarations of love and enough of\nan innocent to convince us that he\ncould be deceived so completely by\nthe machinations of Von Rothbart\nand his daughter.\nIt is often said that the dual role\nof Odette/Odile is one of the most\nchallenging in the classical repertoire for a ballerina; she has to\nembody all the qualities of the swan\nprincess and those of the enchanter\u2019s daughter, captivating both the\nprince and the audience. In this,\nMarquez succeeds more in her interpretation of Odile \u2013 here she is\nout to dazzle the Prince, playing\nwith him, delighting in her mastery\nof the situation but knowing all the\ntime that he never stood a chance.\nHer pas de deux with the Prince is\ncalculated, she really looks like she\nis enjoying the whole deception,\ntrembling a little and flicking her\narms in a cool imitation of Odette\u2019s\nwings, giving him just enough rope\nManet to Picasso\nNational Gallery\nUntil May 2007\nFree\nto hang himself on. As Odette, Marquez is lovely and sorrowful but\nnot quite majestic enough to be a\nqueen and needed a more melting\nquality in her movements to really\nconvince us of her plight.\nThere were excellent supporting\nperformances all round. Belinda\nHatley, Laura Morera and Yohei\nSasaki performed a lively and uplifting Act I pas de trios, Alastair\nMarriott was a suitably menacing\nEvil Spirit and later, a stylish, Mohawk-adorned Von Rothbart and\nIohna Loots and Michael Stojko\nprovided a perky Act III Neapolitan\ndance. The corps was well drilled\nand particularly mesmerising in\nthe white acts and the Orchestra of\nthe Royal Opera House played with\npassion and subtlety under Pavel\nSorokin. If only the production itself\nwas as even.\nThis production mounted by\nAnthony Dowell is set firmly in\nRussia, rather than the Germany\nthat is suggested by the characters\u2019 names, which is fine as it fits\nTchaikovsky\u2019s music better. But in\nsome Acts, notably the non-lake-side ones, the scenery is overpow-eringly fussy. Acts II and IV are\nreasonably restrained and the final\ntableaux, although very traditional,\nis genuinely beautiful; but in Act\nI, I can never understand why the\nPrince decides to hold his birthday\ncelebrations in a gloomy forest, with\nbits of tinsel and baubles hanging\nfrom the branches and apparently\non the edges of a mist-enveloped\nswamp.\nWhen the curtains open on Act III,\nyou would be forgiven for thinking\nthat they had made a horrible mistake and taken us to Von Rothbart\u2019s\ncastle instead of Prince Siegfried\u2019s,\nas it is so full of dangling wires, red\nlighting, oppressive bits of metal\nand an enormous staircase that\nwould not look out of place in a particularly high-camp production of\nPhantom of the Opera. If anything,\nit distracts the eye and makes the\ndancing harder to see, not something that is particularly desirous\nin a ballet production.\nThe Royal Ballet is in the fortunate position where it has wonderful dancers at all levels of its ranks;\nit just needs a production that can\nfully do them justice. It may not be\nthe cheapest company to see but\nyou can get tickets from \u00a311 sitting\nand \u00a35 standing from the box office\non the day, and its an effort that\nwould be well worth it. As someone\nonce told me, \u2018our Olympians of\ndance\u2019 are on top form, in a sold-out, if imperfect, production of this\nmost famous of ballets.\nLily Topham\nJOHAN PERSSON\nFrom time to time large galleries\nlike the National, Portrait and Tate\nBritain advertise re-hangs or exhibitions aimed at bringing in the\ncrowds and heightening the profile\nof the gallery.\nManet to Picasso is one such ex-hibition, and with almost nothing\nof interest to anyone with a basic\nknowledge of the primary colours,\nit is more or less just a tourist trap.\nDon\u2019t be deceived by the impressive list of works on display here.\nYes, you can see Van Gogh\u2019s Sunflowers, Renoir\u2019s Boating on the\nSeine and Monet\u2019s The Water-Lily\nPond just a few feet away from each\nother, but you won\u2019t experience anything from them in the dark and\ncramped Sainsbury Wing. In fact\nyou probably won\u2019t even see anything new, as these are some of the\nmost famous paintings in the world.\nThis exhibition has simply no depth\nor direction, and you\u2019re more likely\nto come out (like me) thinking that\nyou\u2019ve just wasted a good half-hour\nelbowing your way through hoards\nof tourists with their screaming\nchildren.\nIt does have a saving grace.\nSeuret\u2019s Bathers at Asni\u00e8res, a favourite painting of mine, is placed\nwith a collection of Seuret\u2019s stud-ies. This nod to the artistic process\nis sadly unique in this exhibition. If\nyou do insist on going, I find that\nmost galleries tend to be devoid of\nall but the most die-hard art students on Tuesday mornings, possibly the only time you could really\nenjoy these pieces.\nYou\u2019re much better off heading\nupstairs to look at the highly underrated religious paintings of the 13th\nand 14th centuries. It doesn\u2019t seem\nfashionable to show off these excellent medieval works in our largest\ngalleries, but for me they\u2019re some\nof the most moving and inspiring\nart you can see in London.\nDon\u2019t let these galleries tell you\nwhat to like. A lack of knowledge of\nart is not a reason to lack an opin-ion. Sure the Impressionists revolutionised painting, but that doesn\u2019t\nmean that you have to appreciate\nthem, and there are plenty of interesting artistic movements that are\nfrequently overlooked for this kind\nof show.\nLondon has such a wealth of free\nart at your disposal, these no-brain\nexhibitions are almost an insult to\nour rich heritage.\nEmily Lines\nArts Editor\n\n"

    "content": "Every winter, Imperial College Gliding Club (icGC) has a tour to a ridge\nsite in the UK, so that our members\ncan experience the soaring we don\u2019t\nget at our home club, Lasham. The\ntime of year does, however, mean\nthe length of flying that occurs can\nbe very varied.\nLearning our lessons from last\nyear, we decided to venture north\nto Portmoak again over New Year,\nbut this time for 7 days, in the hope\nthat we could do better than the 2\nout of 4 days flying we got. Despite\nthe trailer for our own two-seater\nImperial Gliding Club winter tour\nOn a wing, a prayer and a diet of haggis and deep-fried Mars bars, icGC enjoys ridge soaring and waves\nbreaking a few weeks beforehand,\nour CFI kindly agreed to part with\ntheir DG1000 for a week. So 12 of us,\nincluding four instructors, arrived\ncomplete with our two single-seat-ers (a Discus and an ASW-24) and\nthe DG1000. Now all we needed was\nthe weather to be on our side.\nWell, to be fair, we can\u2019t complain.\nWe got 6 days, and the only thing\nthat stopped us on the other day\nwas that great excuse \u201cit was too\nwindy to rig\u201d. I\u2019d have settled with\nthat, however the weather was better than that \u2013 there was wave to be\nhad. We had one classic wave day,\nwhich resulted in a Silver Height,\na Gold Height, and our resident\n\u201cmountain goat\u201d getting to 14500\u2019.\nEven the DG went to 10000\u2019 numerous times (and a record 11.7knt\naverage climb). Our captain, how-ever, was only able to manage 2800\u2019,\nthough he was shown the error of\nhis ways later in the day.\nEvery day the ridge was working\nlike a train. As a result, even the\nmost inexperienced in our party\ngot to experience ridge soaring\n(and the occasional running silli-ness), as well as continuing their\ntraining. Ridge soaring for the first\ntime is like nothing else, weaving\nin and out, following the contours\nof the hill, often less than a wingspan away from the side of the hill.\nThose who could fly the single-seat-ers were able to hone their soaring\nskills on the ridge, or escape off and\ntry to explore the wave; most days\nthere was something to be found.\nBy staying on-site, not only did\nwe have direct access to Irene\nand Steve\u2019s wonderful food, it also\nmeant we could fall out of bed and\nstart rigging before it was even\nproperly light (though this was too\nearly for some). It\u2019s a nice feeling\nsitting down to breakfast knowing\nthat you\u2019re ready for a good day\u2019s\nsoaring.\nThe other advantage of winter\ntours at Portmoak is its proximity to various towns. This came as\na relief last year, but I can\u2019t say it\nwas needed it this time. We did nevertheless have evening outings in\nboth Perth and Edinburgh.\nThe only downside to the tour\nwere our Hogmanay celebrations.\nOriginally we planned to go to the\nStreet Party in the capital, but by\nthe time we had been diverted\nround to Kincardine (the Forth\nBridge was shut due to high winds)\nall the celebrations were cancelled,\nnot to mention numerous trees\ndown, wheelie-bins and even a\ntrampoline on the roads as a result\nof the 90mph winds.\nSo New Year\u2019s was spent sat\nround a TV in one of the member\u2019s\nhouses. In a way it was a relief, as\neveryone was so tired from the previous days\u2019 flying that an early night\nwas just what we needed. We did return to Edinburgh later in the week\nthough, for the traditional Scottish\nmeal of haggis, neaps and tatties,\nfollowed by a deep-fried Mars bar\n(and a pub crawl).\nThe other evenings we stayed at\nthe gliding club, where you\u2019re guaranteed a friendly atmosphere, with\neveryone sharing experiences of\nthe day\u2019s flying and the occasional\nstrange conversation. It\u2019s one of\nthe few places I\u2019ve flown where the\nlocals make you feel so welcome\n(must be the Scottish hospitality).\nSo many years in the past we\ncome back without actually flying\nat all. Thus the fact that everyone\nmanaged at least 3 hours flying is\nall the more impressive. Having\nhad an exceptionally successful\nwinter tour, what does hit you is just\nhow far away the summer soaring\nseason is. Oh well, there\u2019s always\nuni in the meantime.\nAndrew Cockerell\nIC Gliding Club preparing to take to the sky over Portmoak in Scotland\nlubs& ocieties\nS\n25\nfelix\nFriday 9 February 2007\nC\n\n"

    "content": "Gay adoption \u2013 where\u2019s the crime?\nC\nhristians, Jews and\nMuslims put down their\nKatusha rockets, grenades and holy texts\nat the end of 2006 for\nan afternoon of protest against the\nLabour government\u2019s Equality Act,\ndue to come into force in April. But\nit was no peace deal that brought\nabout such an act of unity. Instead a\ncommon hatred, greater than that\nwhich compels these religions to\nmurder one another and, for those\nlacking the sufficient funds, blow\nthemselves up, meant they were on\nthe same side of the protest fence.\nThe gays. Long condemned by\nthe great Lord in the sky through\nHis various messengers and their\npost humus biographers, and surely scurvy to all that humanity holds\ntrue and dear. It is quite likely that\nshould these unhumans, who now\nhave the right to form legal part-nerships, have free reign to adopt\nany child they please, God (peace\nbe upon Him and all the rest of it)\nshall conjure up a lightning bolt the\nsize of the Crab Nebula and fire it\nupon the Earth, killing all those\nguilty of sin, and leaving their enlightened bretherin in but a slightly\ndisfigured state.\nPerhaps the greatest shame of\nall from this episode in sectarian\nsquabbling, is that the Equality Act\naddresses everybody who could\npossibly be discriminated against,\nespecially those so angered by it.\nIn reference to the current dispute,\nChristian supported adoption agencies cannot refuse a Muslim couple\non the grounds of religion.\nThe Church believes that gay\ncouples are unfit to raise children.\n\u201cThe key thing we have to remember in all of this is the interests of\nthe children\u201d Cardinal Cormac\nMurphy-O\u2019Connor said in his letter\nto cabinet ministers. Are all gays\nWith the Equality Act due to come into force in April, religious leaders have united to condemn one of the\nconsequences of the act \u2013 the right of homosexual couples to adopt from public adoption services\nreally any less qualified than any\nman and woman? How can it be\nclaimed that well educated, stable\nsingle sex couples are always fundamentally worse than a Mr and\nMrs who drink Stella Artois and left\nschool with one GCSE in Geography between them? Are there no\nhomosexuals with steady incomes\nand reasonable judgment?\nI don\u2019t imagine that all same sex\ncouples will want to adopt; probably not even a majority. But those\nwho do, deserve the same access\nand options. Cases should be on an\nindividual basis, and genuinely for\nthe good of the little scamper. The\nchurch should not have a legal exemption to discriminate.\nThat neither Christian nor Islamic\nscriptures were written at the time\nof their respective prophet\u2019s lives\n(in fact several hundred years af-ter) and that interpretations of the\nword of God changes whenever is\nconvenient for those in power must\nsurely be seen in this \u2018enlightened\u2019\nera, with increasingly easy access\nto information, for what it is. Was\nit not enough for Karl Marx to proclaim that religion was the \u2018opium\nof the masses\u2019?\nChrist fought the Romans and became the reasoning to crusade, the\nJews united against the Egyptians,\nCanaanites and Philistines, and Islam was the tool of the caliphs to\nspread their power and influence\nacross the whole of north Africa\nand into Spain.\nOrganised religion, specifically\nthe monotheistic entities spawned\nin the unforgiving desserts of the\nMiddle East, has been but the rules\nof leaders; Moses, Mohammad\n(peace be upon Him and all the rest\n\u201cAre all gays\nreally any less\nqualified than\nany man and\nwoman?\u201d\nof it), Jesus; searching for clout and\nlegitimacy. What better legitimacy\nthen to come from our creator and\ndestroyer. What greater impetus to\nmartyr yourself than the promise\nof an afterlife of eternal bliss. What\ngreater incentive to behave than\nthe threat of divine wrath. For what\nCardinal Cormac Murphy O\u2019Conner, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams\nit\u2019s worth, this author believes that\nreligion is and has been a good tool\nfor human accomplishment.\nBut it becomes obsolete and unfortunate when those who wield\npower start to believe the very\nfairy tales designed to control the\nmasses.\nClimate change, and what you can do to help\nC\nlimate change is one\nof the most important\nissues in the modern\nworld. We all know that\nthe climate is changing\nand that this is a result of our activi-ties. Science has established that climate change is a real phenomenon\nand the major cause, an increase in\ncarbon dioxide, are directly related.\nThere is no debate on the validity\nof these facts in the scientific com-munity. The reality is that most of\nus will see the dramatic effects of\nclimate change in our lifetime.\nThe problem is that we know all\nthese facts, but what can one person do to help? Surely these are\nissues that can only be tackled on\na global level? Well, yes and no. In\nreality, governments have to change\nthe big things and we, the individu-als, need to change the little things.\nLike the old proverb says, \u2018you climb\na mountain in little steps, not one\nleap\u2019. If we are to reduce the effects\nof climate change we need to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide\nwe put into the atmosphere. This is\nnot a difficult concept; even George\nBush has conceded this basic rela-tionship. The major contributor to\nhuman produced carbon dioxide is\npower generation, and a crucial step\nin reducing the amount of carbon\ndioxide entering the atmosphere is\nto reduce the amount of energy we\nuse.\nSo what can we do? Well, there are\nnumerous ways we can all help save\nenergy in our halls of residence,\nhome or on campus. The obvious\nexample is to turn off lights when\nthey are not required, such as when\nwe leave a room. Also, leaving your\nPC, TV, or CD player on when you\nare not using it wastes a lot of en-ergy, and even on standby the power\nusage can range between 10 and 15\nwatts or more. If you leave four devices on standby, it uses the equivalent power of a 60 watt bulb. Over\nthe past year in the UK the Energy\nSaving Trust estimates that stereos\nleft on standby have cost \u00a3290m in\nelectricity and produced 1.6 million\ntonnes of carbon dioxide.\nWe can also influence the policies\nof the shops we use and the places\nwe work. Imperial is at the very forefront of environmental science, but if\nwe look closer even here there are a\nfew minor changes that could make\na world of difference, possibly liter-ally. In the communal areas of some\nhalls of residence the lights are left\non 24 hours a day. If this is the case\nin your hall, discuss this with the\nwardening team and the hall man-agers, possibly no one has thought\nof changing the lighting? If the\nlights can not be turned off because\nRichard BlackwellWhitehead\nPembridge Gardens\nWarden\nthey are needed for safety reasons\nsuggest that timers, or movement\nsensors are used, and if the light is\nabsolutely necessary make sure energy saving bulbs are used. In fact\nmake sure your hall, home or area\nof campus is using energy saving\nbulbs full stop. In many areas of college these methods are already being used, but there is definitely room\nfor improvement and a bit of positive\nencouragement never hurts.\nAnother effective step to reduce\ncarbon dioxide emissions is to recycle things. Many items can be recycled for less energy that it takes to\nmake a new item. So, use recycle\nbins where they are available. If\nyour department does not have recycle bins then ask for them to be\nintroduced. Little steps like these\nwill help us save energy, save people\nmoney, and ultimately reduce the\nimpact of climate change.\n4 felix Friday 9 February 2007\nomment&\nOpinion\nC\n\n"

The censure\nitself passed almost unanimously,\nwith only two of the twenty-seven\nCouncil members present voting\nagainst it. Since then, Felix has\nlearned that one, if not both of the\nAndy Sykes\nEditor-in-chief\nvotes cast against the censure motion were from Council members\nwho were dissatisfied with the\nmove to censure, preferring instead\na motion of no confidence.\nThe proceedings opened with a\nlengthy speech by Ms Rahman in\nher defence, which Jon Matthews\n(Deputy President, Finance & Services), the paper\u2019s author, responded\nto before the debate was opened up\nto the floor, and an arranged list of\nspeakers.\nCouncil members were given a\nfull rebuttal to Mr Matthews\u2019 paper,\nwhich ran to sixty pages, bringing\nthe total length of documents each\nmember was expected to read to\nmore than one hundred pages.\nMs Rahman brought a number of\nGSA Executive members to speak\nfor her; however, most Council\nmembers seemed dissatisfied with\ntheir defence of Shama, which focussed on her GSA Chair role and\nvery little on her Deputy President\nrole (which requires her to work\nthe same hours as the other sabbs,\namong other things). They praised\nher approachable and friendly\nmanner, and the events that she\nhad organised.\nThey raised the point about a\npostgraduate representative\u2019s fate\nbeing voted on by a mostly undergraduate body, even though Ms\nRahman is a Deputy President,\nelected by the entire student body.\nMost of the Council rejected this\ndefence, and the repetition of this\npoint only served to frustrate some\nof those present.\nSurprisingly, the controversial\nevidence that made it into the final\npaper (namely, the monitoring of\nMs Rahman\u2019s arrival times, and the\nemail evidence of an alleged premeditated \u2018sickie\u2019 as rerpoted pre-viously) was barely touched upon.\nMost of the early discussion centred around Ms Rahman\u2019s poor\ntimekeeping as described in the pa-per. Notably, these were failures to\nattend important College meetings,\nthe absence from Management\n& Planning Group (a confidential\nstaff/sabb briefing), and her running of the GSA stall at Freshers\u2019\nFair. Ms Rahman offered a number\nof excuses for these, and accept\nthat her timekeeping was poor.\nContinued on page 2\nThis is the first censure\nagainst a sabbatical since\n1981, when Danny McCabe (a\nformer Deputy President) was\ncensured by Council.\nA censure motion is, as one\nofficer put it, \u201can official slap\non the wrist\u201d. It means that\nCouncil has accepted poor\nconduct on the part of the officer who is censured.\nIt carries no immediate effect,\nunlike a no confidence motion,\nwhich would have resulted in\nMs Rahman\u2019s removal from\nthe DPGS position.\nThe no confidence motion\nwas written by Jon Matthews\n(Deputy President, Finance &\nServices), and has been held\nup in Union Court while various legalities were discussed.\nThe censure motion also\nrequires that any new paper\nbrought to Council about Ms\nRahman\u2019s performance to be\na no confidence motion. The\nnew motion cannot be \u2018downgraded\u2019 to a censure.\nWhat is censure?\nDefending: Shama Rahman, Deputy President (Graduate Students) Prosecuting: Jon Matthews, Deputy President (Finance & Services)\n25\npage\nGuardian Student Newspaper of the Year\n\n"

The parents are responsible,\nnot fashion.\" Anorexia isn't just a\ndisease, it's a symptom of wider\nmental health problems. Obviously\nit's not responsible to publish pho-to's of blatantly anorexic models.\nHowever if a girl is a natural size\n4 (equivalent to American size\nzero), should she be stopped from\nmodelling?\nWhy are painfully thin girls used\nin fashion advertising in the first\nplace? Is it a case of aspiration sell-ing? You can never be too rich or too\nthin.

Ironically\nperhaps, yet although anorexia and\nobesity cause opposite shocking\nextremes in appearance, are they\nboth manifestations of a sick cul-ture?

A\nsurvey of teenage girls showed that\n15%, an increase from 3% before\nthe arrival of television, reported\nthrowing up after meals.\nThe survey also showed 74% of\ngirls reported feeling \"too big or\nfat\". So supposedly media does have\nan effect on disordered eating. But\nSarah Skeete\nFashion Editor\npassed down families; the mother\nteaches her daughters how to cook,\nand they then cook for their husband and teach their daughters.\nWith feminism came also microwave meals and liberation from the\nkitchen.\nWhile this liberation can only be\na good thing, it has meant generations of families growing up without\nknowing basic nutrition and how to\ncook outside of microwave meals\nand toast. The unhealthy modern\ndiet has meant an increase in obesity or other disordered eating. If\nyou don't want to be fat, but don't\nknow how to eat healthily and don't\nexercise, then the solution for some\npeople is not to eat.\nIfpeoplehadtheknowledgeofhow\nto eat healthily and got of their ars-es and exercised then we wouldn't\nneed a traffic light system.

    "content": "Dench cranks up the freak factor\nIs the film adaptation of Zo\u00eb Heller\u2019s 2003 novel really worthy of the Oscar nominations it has received?\nThree years ago, UK movie production was thrown into chaos by tax\nreforms that threatened to kill the\nindustry in this country. Stalwarts\nlike the Bond franchise were going to decamp to Eastern Europe\nto save money, and the Harry Potter films had an uncertain future. A\nsad time indeed for the country that\nraised Hitchcock, amongst other\ngreats.\nBut then something changed,\nand as 2006 passed and 2007 set in,\nit seems that we might be back on\ntrack. The Queen is at the forefront,\nleading her people towards Oscar\nvictory, but this was never going to\nbe a one woman assault. Along with\nKate Winslet, there is a third, and\nthere\u2019s plenty fight left in good ol\u2019\nDame Judi Dench yet, as Notes on\na Scandal proves.\nFor those of you who haven\u2019t seen\nthe preposterously thorough trail-er, the premise is an intriguing one.\nDench plays a battle-axe teacher,\nnarrating through her diary the\nstory of her developing friendship\nwith new staff room addition, Cate\nBlanchett, and, as it turns out, Judi\nmight be in it for more than the odd\npint down the local, *nudge wink*.\nTemptation of a different persuasion entirely takes Blanchett how-ever, in the form of one of her new\npupils, despite her husband, Bill\nNighy, waiting at home. If the scandal of the title has not yet grabbed\nyou, rest assured that Patrick Marber\u2019s script in the hands of such capable actors definitely will.\nThis is a film based on youthful\nAlex Casey traits that the characters just can\u2019t\nleave in the classroom: infatuation,\ndesire, dissatisfaction with life and\nrevenge. Blanchett longs to define\nherself outside her family while\nDench longs to find someone. Innocent enough it seems, but some\nchildren just can\u2019t deal with not getting their own way. And therein lies\nthe game\u2026\nDench is one of the greats, with\nan ability to lift characters that\nseem one-dimensional to an unprecedented level. Without her, Mrs\nHenderson Presents would surely\nnever have been made, never mind\nseen. Her character in Notes is not\nan easily likeable one, scheming to\nthe end and relishing in malevo-lence, yet Dench lets us understand\nher desperation and so elicits the\nslight sympathy that would have\nescaped a lesser actress.\nBlanchett also surpasses her\nr\u00f4le in Babel, as a conflicted teacher born into a middle-class family\nduring the age of teenage rebellion\nand now trapped in the monotony\nof a family life that she struggles\nto identify with. Her foolishness is\nnot as easily accepted by the audience as the loneliness of Dench\u2019s\ncharacter, but once caught up in\neverything, she holds her own. Bill\nNighy plays Blanchett\u2019s cuckold in\nthe final piece of the acting showcased here, capturing my attention\nin a way I hadn\u2019t expected between\nthe two fearsome female leads.\nThe real star here is Patrick Marber\u2019s screenplay though, adapted\nfrom Zoe Heller\u2019s novel, as it completely envelops you. This is eloquence that eludes Hollywood and\nstrikes a blow for the Brits in film-making.Itisbyturnscomical,bitchy\nand sinister, especially Dench\u2019s\nnarration, which leads to the most\nstellar moments. The schoolyard\nanalogy propels the story forward\nas basic adolescent emotions usurp\nreason throughout life, and its collection of fantastic one-liners mean\nmy money lies here for the Best\nAdapted Screenplay Oscar.\nThe film isn\u2019t perfect, I grant you.\nIt seems to cut itself short at the\nend and for only 90 minutes running time this seems a shame. Also,\nif you\u2019ve seen the trailer, I don\u2019t\nknow how much is going to surprise\nyou plot-wise. The treat here is not\nsimply the story, nor Dame Judi\u2019s\nbath scene, but the words that tell\nthe story.\nThis is expression as only the\nBrits can do \u2013 Hollywood hasn\u2019t\nwon yet.\nBlanchett could swear she felt someone looking at her\n17\nfelix\nFriday 9 February 2007\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n15a Harrington Road\nSouth Kensington\nLondon SW7 3ES\n(1 Minute walk from\nSouth Kensington Tube)\nTe l e p h o n e 0 2 0 7 8 2 3 8 9 6 8\nw w w . f r e s h h a i r d r e s s e r s . c o . u k\nCASH ONLY\n\u2018Still the best student offer in\nSouth Kensington!\u2019\nONLY BY EXPERIENCED STYLISTS\n\u00a326 .....

This is a key\npoint, since the foremost goal of\nTest Drive Unlimited is amassing\nvast amounts of wealth and buying\nlots of seizure-inducingly expensive\ncars. Why am I reviewing the beta\nversion, some of you might ask?\nWell the game was released for the\nXbox 360 last year and (thankfully)\nAtari have allowed six months of\nfine tuning for the PC version. It\u2019s\nas good as done with only very minor bugs to wrinkle out.\nTDU was a revolutionary game\nfirst released for the Xbox 360 at the\nend of last year, and is revolutionary in that it is a driving MMO. You\nhave the option of playing through\nthe game using a single player or a\nmultiplayer profile, the main difference being that in online mode, the\nisland\u2019s random NPC racers are replaced by human players.\nAnisland?TDUtakesplaceonthe\nisland of Oahu, Hawaii. The entire\nisland and its roads have been meticulously recreated in game, and\nscaled so that 1km of in game road\nwill take you 1 minute to traverse\nif you\u2019re going at 60km/h (i.e. it will\ntake you the same amount of time\nto drive round it in game as you\nwould in real life, assuming you\nhave a 600bhp car in real life).\nGraphically, it\u2019s a lush paradise,\nwith softly swaying trees and wavy\ngrass and a blinding sun, all bathed\nin a warm coating of HDR lighting.\nIt feels wonderful, coming in from\nthe cold to be greeted with TDU\u2019s\nsunbathed highways.\nBut of course, the real stars of the\ngame are the cars! TDU boasts over\na hundred cars and motorcycles,\ncoming in the exotic wallet-nuking\nvariety (Lamborghinis, Ferraris,\nMcLarens, Astons), the affordable\nbut likeable (Audis, Nissans, Lotuses) and the obscure wonders\n(Koenigsegg, Ascari, Spyker).\nEach car is exquisitely detailed.\nEach grill, each intake, each brake\npad has been lovingly modelled.\nThe interior of each car has been\ngiven the same tender care. Seats\nso well made you feel comfortable\njust by looking at them; proper textures for leather, wood, and plastic;\nadjustable ride height and distance\nfrom steering wheel; and colours\naccording to each manufacturer\u2019s\nactual specifications. The cars are\nindeed beautiful things, that island\nparadise I talked about above simply pales in comparison to whichever car you\u2019re driving.\nA key aspect about TDU that\u2019s different from other racing or driving\ngames is that much more emphasis\nis placed on how the car feels, rather than how it performs. Each car\nfeels different, and takes getting\nused to. This is a rather abstract\nthing, and is best experienced first\nhand. It plays an important part in\nthe game, helping you choose cars,\nand win races.\nA Ferrari requires your full undivided attention and precise ma-noeuvring, for example, while a\nLamborghini feels rock solid but\nnot as nimble. These are the sort\nof things you can \u2018feel\u2019 in each car.\nRaces are won more by knowing\nhow a car performs and knowing\nwhich car to use than knowing how\nto drive it well. But rest assured,\nthe level of driving aid is adjustable,\nand these beautiful machines can\nbe as easy or as hard to drive as you\nlike.\nObviously, getting your hands\non these Things Of Never-ending\nBeauty\u2122 will take some effort. Your\nchosen character arrives in Oahu\nwith nothing but enough cash for a\nhouse and a car. You begin by buying those, and then proceed to go\nout and look for work.\nWork comes in the form of races,\ntime challenges, speed challenges,\nand delivery missions. The latter\ngives the most cash, but takes the\nlongest to complete. You can also\nparticipate in official or player created online challenges against other people.\nOr you could simply drive up to\nanother player and flick your head-lights. If he/she accepts, you then\nagree on an ending point, and away\nyou go on an impromptu race.\nAfter collecting enough money,\nyou can either buy another house\n(when your current one runs out of\ngarage space), buy a car, or upgrade\nor repaint an existing car. This is\ndone by driving to the appropriate\nbuilding somewhere on the island.\nThe car and bike dealerships are\nspread out and the tuner shops\nare hidden until you drive by them.\nSince this island is huge (1000 miles\nof road), you can teleport to any location you\u2019ve been to before.\nThis compulsive circle of race,\nbuy, race some more should be\nenough to keep all but the hardened\ncar-hater stuck to the game for\nsome time. As I\u2019ve said, the point\nof the game isn\u2019t the racing, it\u2019s the\nownership and driving of nice cars.\nInterestingly,thegame\u2019sperformance is not affected by you playing\nonline. The whole game is, in a way,\noffline except for the other human\ndrivers, in that the game is still run\nlocally from your computer, and not\nfrom a far-away server. Your internet connection will hardly affect\nthe game. It\u2019s you and other online\nplayers \u2018populating\u2019 the game.\nPC users need not be turned off\nby the prospect of playing this on\na keyboard instead of a gamepad.\nThe controls are simple and effec-tive; with a full range of options\nshould you need to alter your steering or something else.\nAs of this beta, the only existing\nbugs that I\u2019ve encountered are errors in the race positions counter\n(quite rare) and graphical glitches\nwhen starting the game. Both bugs\nhave been reported and will most\nlikely be fixed come release day.\nThis is undoubtedly one of the\nbest car games the PC has ever\nseen. If you\u2019ll excuse me now, I\u2019ve\ngot to go and stare perversely at\nmore beautiful, shiny, luxurious,\npowerful, fast, cars.\nA Koenigsegg tears through the lush Hawaiian streets.

They have\nalso drawn ridicule from a number\nof Union officers, who have commented to Felix of the lack of experience that the group exhibit.\nThe group has even gone as far as\nto set up a Facebook group named\n\u201cGiannuzzi 2007\u201d after their Presidential candidate, Jules Giannuzzi.\nHowever, this group has been encouraging its members to vote for\nthe Slate, breaking the election\nrules in the Union Constitution, as\nthis can be seen as \u201ccampaigning\nprior to close of nominations\u201d. The\nmaximum penalty for breaching\nthis rule is disqualification from the\nelection.\nHowever, those involved have\nnow been sent a warning by the\nsabbaticals after it was spotted by\na Union officer, and the group has\nbeen cleared of any posts. It is unlikely any further action will be taken against the candidates.\nThe Facebook group now says\n\u201cthis group is in the process of closing down\u201d. The group at one point\ncontained more than 60 members,\nincluding those who had been invited but not accepted membership.\nSources close to the group have\ntold Felix that the Deputy President candidates are, in our source\u2019s\nwords, \u201cin it for a laugh\u201d. However,\nMr Giannuzzi\u2019s Facebook status\nis rather provocatively currently\nset as \u201cGiannuzzi is President and\ndivine leader\u201d. It also appears the\ngroup may have recruited a member to stand for Felix Editor, though\nthis is unconfirmed.\nThe current sabb team have also\nexpressed concern over the lack\nof experienced Presidential candi-dates. It was expected that at least\none seasoned officer would stand,\nbut so far the majority of the candi-datesareunknowninUnionpolitics.\nHowever, there were rumours that\nthe current Deputy President (Fi-nance & Services), Jon Matthews\nwould stand; he was confirmed as\na Presidential candidate just before\ngoing to press.\nThe other candidates standing\nfor President at the time of going\nto press are Sophie Spillard, Diogo\nGeraldes, Eric Lai (current Deputy\nPresident, Clubs & Societies), and\nBen Schneider.\nNominations close on Tuesday\n13 February, and campaigning will\nbegin after this. Felix would like to\nremind readers that the Union Constitution requires that you think before you vote.\nThe candidates\u2019 manifestos will\nappear in Felix, and will be available on the web at the same time.\nDetails of how to second candidates\ncan be found at www.imperialcol-legeunion.org/vote.\nMark Tweedy\nFacebook Watcher\nThe editor couldn\u2019t find a picture of Southwell Hall, so here\u2019s a ballot box instead\nUnion Executive discusses\nfuture of Deputy President\n(Graduate Students) role\nIn the wake of the censure motion against the Deputy President\n(Graduate Students), Shama Rahman,theUnionExecutivediscussed\nthe future of the role yesterday.\nThe Council has already voted not\nto elect a DPGS this year, in anticipation of a review of the position.\nA paper jointly written by John\nCollins, Union President, and Ms\nRahman was discussed by the Executive at length. The paper focuses on the current problems with the\nDPGS position, including the placement as a Deputy President, incurring both the responsibility of being\nchair of the GSA (Graduate Students Association, representing all\npostgraduates) as well as the usual\nday-to-day tasks of being a Deputy\nPresident.\nIt also focusses on the problems\nthat have dogged the previous two\nincumbents of the post, Luis Hui\nand Ms Rahman. Both faced difficulty in getting training prior to\ntaking up their posts, as they were\ncompletely their masters during\nthe handover period in July-August, and could only spend one day\na week (if that) at work.\nThe paper says that the DPGS position has faced \u201cintense scrutiny\u201d\nfrom the student media (in other\nwords, Felix and Live!), as well as\nfrom senior volunteer officers, who\nfeel the job does not warrant a full-time sabbatical position. \u2018Demoting\u2019\nthis position to a paid volunteer level should \u201creduce the level of scrutiny to that of a CSC [Club & Society\nChair] or Faculty Union President\nlevel,\u201d as the paper puts it.\nThe paper suggests removing the\nDPGS post and replacing it with a\nnumber of paid volunteer posts.\nThere would a President of the GSA,\nsubsuming one of Ms Rahman\u2019s\nroles, and two Vice Presidents (VP\nof Research Students, and VP of\nTaught Students). The significant\nsum of money given to the Union\nto fund the DPGS position in the\nsubvention (around \u00a328,000) would\nbe used to pay these volunteer of-ficers, with the extra being plowed\nback into the GSA to add to the current funding received from the central Union for events.\nA number of those present at the\nmeeting raised concerns over having paid volunteer officers; no other\nvolunteers are paid for their work.\nMr Collins outlined the reasons for\nthe positions being paid, saying that\nthey would replace demonstrating\nand teaching work for the postgraduate officer concerned, and would\npay about the same as the former\nwould. This, he said, would encourage PhD students to stand for the\nvolunteer positions. Many, including the CSC Chairs, vehemently\ndisagreed with this proposal, arguing that it would create tension\nbetween the unpaid undergraduate\nvolunteers and the paid postgraduate volunteers.\nBen Harris (Deputy President,\nEducation & Welfare) explained\nthat the DPGS role could not be\nremoved without providing some\nequivalent support structure for\npostgraduates, or, as he put it, College would defecate on the Union\nfrom a great height. The drive for\nthe DPGS position came from College, after a QAA review found that\npostgraduate welfare support was\npoor. Presumably, a failure to suitably replace the DPGS role would result in College removing the \u00a328,000\nfrom the subvention.\nThe Executive seemed resolved\nto removing the full-time DPGS\nposition.\nCentenary balloon race ends\nThe Union\u2019s Centenary balloon race is complete, with the winning\nballoon being sent back from Oberzeuzheim, almost 350 miles from\nthe launch point at Beit Quad. Other balloons made it as far as the\nEssex and Kent, though most ended up in East London.\n\n"

    "content": "Look outside! Global Warming!\nA solution to the world\u2019s energy crisis, and global warming, brought to you by the letter H and the number 2\nAs the weather gets weirder, news\nreports get gloomier, and even David Cameron decides to join in the\nfun, it seems that when it comes\nto fossil fuels and climate change,\nwe\u2019re pretty much screwed.\nBarring those who have had their\nheads buried firmly in the sand for\nthe past 12 months, virtually everyone has grasped by now that in\norder to avert the most serious effects of global warming, it is time to\nreduce our carbon emissions, and\nfast.\nBut for all the promises of a hydrogen future, the majority of research has so far proved unfruitful,\nleaving us with an uneasy choice\nbetween traditional renewable energy sources and nuclear power.\nHelp may be at hand however, in\nthe form of a collaboration between\nProfessors Tsuchida and Komatsu\nfrom Waseda University, Japan,\nand Imperial College London.\nThe scientists used the tools of\nsynthetic biology to synthesise a\nlarge molecular complex, made\nof the blood protein albumin and\nhaem component porphyrin, which\ncan use solar energy to split water molecules into hydrogen and\noxygen.\nAt present, the most commonly\ndiscussed methods of producing hydrogen to fuel a hydrogen economy\nare electrolysis, which is so energy-intensive as to make it economically unviable, and extraction from\nnatural gas. As natural gas is itself\na fossil fuel, this process is also ultimately unsustainable.\nBut by replacing the iron atom\nnormally found at the centre of porphyrin (involved with carrying oxygen around the body in the blood as\na component of haemoglobin) with\nan atom of zinc, the team managed\nto modify the structure and chemical behaviour of the molecule. On\nfusion with genetically modified\nalbumin protein, the resulting complex was found to possess remarkable hydrogen-generating powers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting to prove that we\ncan use these biological structures\nas a conduit to harness solar energy\nKrystyna Larkham\nScience Editor\nWith pressure constantly mounting to find sustainable energy, is this a sign of of the future?\n(It better be snowing outside otherwise that title is going to flop...)\n8 felix Friday 9 February 2007\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPolonium-210 was on the menu last\nThursday evening at the Dana Centre, with a panel of experts serving\nup the audience plenty of food for\nthought concerning this singularly\nunpalatable isotope, once again in\nthe news as further claims in the\nLitvinenko case emerge.\nYet who did what to whom was not\nat issue \u2013 indeed, one of the panel,\nDr Michael Clark, the science\nspokesman for the Health Protection Agency (HPA), was naturally\nvery loathe to discuss these sorts of\nDispelling the Po-210 myths\ndetails, as they related to an ongoing case of his. Instead, the aim was\nto elucidate the science of the case,\nfrom the source of the poison, how\nit affects the human body, to details\nof clean-up operation.\nProfessor Dennis Henshawe\n(Bristol), started the presentations\nwith a few basic facts about this isotope of Polonium. Although it has a\nshort half-life (roughly 130 days) it\u2019s\nmaintained at a constant level in\nthe environment, as it\u2019s produced\nby the decay of uranium, which has\na half life of 4.5 billion years. In fact,\nas uranium\u2019s relatively common in\nthe crust, at a few parts-per-million,\npolonium\u2019s as ubiquitous as radon,\nand contributes to half of the background radiation dose.\nBuilding on this introduction,\nProfessor Nick Priest (Middlesex)\ncontinued to the effects on the body.\nHe pointed out that since Po-210\nemits alpha particles, which have\na very short range, it has to enter\nthe body before it can do any real\ndamage. Litvinenko seems to have\ntaken it up in a cup of tea, a rather\nunlikely poisoned chalice.\nYet this mode of entry was well-suited to Po-210: whereas other al-pha-emitters are relatively poorly\nabsorbed in the gut (1 part in 10000\nfor plutonium), as Po-210 passes\nthrough up to 60% is absorbed into\nthe bloodstream. Once there, it circulates around the body, causing\nespecial damage to parts which\nproduce new cells, such as testes,\nhair, gut and skin cells.\nLitvinenko\u2019s dose was so high\nmuch was concentrated in his liver,\nleading to jaundice too. Both Priest\nand Clark, who spoke later, highlighted the difficulty in identifying\npoisoning by Po-210. The initial\nsymptoms \u2013 feeling nauseous within hours \u2013 were far more likely to be\ndue to gastroenteritis. Only as other symptoms slowly emerged were\nother possibilities investigated.\nPo-210 was finally diagnosed due\nnot to its emissions \u2013 the hospitals\naren\u2019t set up to detect the short-range alpha radiation \u2013 but due to\nthe symptoms of Acute Radiation\nSyndrome (ARS) Litvinenko exhib-ited. Priest noted this was the first\ncase of ARS from an alpha-emitter;\nthe Curies had also died from exposure to alpha radiation, but years\nlater.\nNumbers aplenty were provided\nby Dr Paddy Reagan (Surrey) whilst\nhe examined provenance. He pointed out that since the alpha particles\nare very energetic, compared to the\nchemical bonds they damage within cells, very few suffice to provide\na lethal dose. A deadly 500 million\nBecquerel (decays per second) can\ncome from a few microgrammes\n\u2013 an invisible speck. To create this,\nthe most likely contender would be\na high-flux nuclear reactor. Exposing a sample of (stable) bismuth-209 to 1014\nneutrons per second\nwould convert a sufficient quantity\nto Bi-210, which decays to Po-210.\nThis is relatively easy \u2013 even he\u2019d\nmade some with this method!\nA further advantage is that as only\nBi and Po are present in the sam-ple, there wouldn\u2019t be a geographic\nfingerprint; it would be impossible\nto pinpoint the source of the poison.\nThese advantages would outweigh\nthe difficulty in separating the Po210 from the rest of the sample\nswiftly, before too much decays.\nYet if creating it yielded difficul-ties, cleaning up after was fraught\nwith even more, according to Mike\nClark. Once police advisers had\nidentified Po-210 as the culprit (us-ing methods he didn\u2019t care to dis-cuss), the HPA found a trail of contamination in the hotel rooms, bars\nand offices Litvinenko had visited\nbefore being hospitalised. Large\nnumbers of staff, including nurses\nat the hospital, had potentially been\ncaught in this messy wake, and the\nproblem of ensuring their safety\nwas compounded by the lack of a\nstandard monitoring procedure\n\u2013 almost no-one works with Po-210.\nIn the ensuing discussion, he singled out the HPA\u2019s medics as playing a key role in interviewing the\nnaturally concerned staff, and in\ngetting them to provide crucial 24hr\nurine samples.\nIt transpired those most affected,\nother than the victim, had been\nLitvinenko\u2019s family and some of the\nbar staff. They\u2019d received doses of\n10s of milliSieverts (a measure of\nradiation\u2019s effect on the body), not\nan unusual dose. In fact it\u2019s impossible to distinguish its health effects as it\u2019s equivalent to the accumulated dose from 10 years of living\nin southern England.\nBut humans weren\u2019t the HPA\u2019s\nonly responsibility. The trail had\nto be cleaned up by contractors,\nas affected materials, effectively\nlow-level nuclear waste, need to be\nstored for a few years until they\u2019re\nno longer a danger. Yet why was the\ntrail so messy?\nIt seems Po-210\u2019s a keen traveller:\nnot only does it spread by touch, but\nalso by a process known as recoil. A\nglass of Po-210 in solution, though\nit initially seems inert, will swiftly\ncontaminate a whole room through\ndiffusion: the significant energies\nimparted to the solution as decaying nuclei recoil allows others to\nescape the glass too. This property,\nshared with tritium, means Po-210\u2019s\nbeen used to practise training with\ndifficult materials\nThe discussion closed on a chilling\nnote \u2013 although melatonin, used in\ntreating jetlag, had been mentioned\nby the panel as a possible treatment (it\u2019s an anti-oxidant capable\nof entering the cells and mopping\nup damaging free radicals created\nby the alpha particles) Litvinenko\u2019s\ndose was far too high for this to be\nof any use; once in his gut, nothing\ncould be done.\nAnd though Po-210\u2019s messy trail\nmakes it by no means a perfect\nmurder weapon, it\u2019s undoubtedly a\nnasty one, more than enough to put\nother dissidents off their lunch.\nto separate water out into hydrogen\nand oxygen,\u201d says Dr Stephen Curry, a structural biologist from the\nDivision of Cell and Molecular Biology at Imperial College London. \u201cIn\nthe long term, these synthetic molecules may provide a more environmentally friendly way of producing\nhydrogen, which can be used as a\n\u2018green\u2019 fuel.\u201d\nImperial College\u2019s Alexander\nFleming once changed the course\nof history with his little discovery,\nPenicillin. Could it be that we are\nabout to do it all over again?\nEdmund Henley\nAll the talk about Polonium-210 became rather intense\nA deadly 500\nmillion Becquerel\ncan come from\nan invisible speck\n\n"

    "content": "IC Women\u2019s Rugby are great in the scrum\nA close encounter of the footy kind\nSamantha Pemberton\n26 felix Friday 9 February 2007\nSPORT sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe improvised team was led on\nto the field by captain Mooknellay,\nwho maintains a bizarre attraction\nto women of the \u2018terminally pregnant\u2019 variety, although let us not underestimate the effects of gravity!\nLike a drug fuelled rave, the game\nkicked off in the usual frenetic fashion and despite the lack of artificial\ndrugs, the referee was certainly a\ndope worth shooting.\nWith King\u2019s taking advantage\nof our \u2018settling period\u2019, we relied\non the defensive efforts of Henrik,\nPeter, Cody, Rob and Sang to deny\nthem any leverage. A cross from\nthe left served as the catalyst for\nour equilibrium when a penalty was\nawarded for an alleged hand-ball.\nThe spot-kick was nonchalantly\nconverted by top Bola Bola seed\nHamish, whose thirst for booze is\nso intense, theories of how he used\nto spike his mother\u2019s shoulder boulders during breast feeding are now\nbeing realised.\nWe subsequently took command\nof the match, with James Platt applying a neat finish to double our\nlead. Moments later, the ball was\neffortlessly worked down the right\nallowing me to play a neat ball into\nDamien to shoot straight at the\nKings No.1. Fortunately the keeper\ndeveloped an instantaneous bout\nof H5N1 as he flapped wildly at ball\nbut to no avail.\n3-0 up in the opening 25 minutes\ncame as both a blessing and a curse\nas complacency began to creep in.\nThe medics put up a fight by slotting\nhome a goal when their lone striker\nwas cleanly played in. Kings were\nallowed further reprieve when they\nwere awarded an indirect free kick\nin our area when Henrik allegedly\nheld onto the ball for longer than\n6 seconds. Kings\u2019 placed attempt\ncrept into the bottom corner and it\nwas not long before they eventually\nlevelled it when their striker was\nplayed in again to somehow dink in\na third.\nThe comical Medic comeback\nwas complete as our composure\ntook a combustible form. However\nI must now prohibit the progressive prostitution of this particular\nportion of prose since it is prone to\nprovoke proclamations that my proverbial prop and much prophesised\nprocurement of promiscuous ladies\nare mere propaganda.\nA half time score line reminiscent\nof the FA Cup final meant everything was still to play for. However, given the depth of tactical\nknowledge within the team, such a\nhalf-time outcome had been proph-esised only days earlier, allowing us\nto employ the strategy often used\nby cannibal\u2019s, whereby male victims are shown porn in the hope of\nenticing additional sustenance. The\nbait was set, and while Kings offered little in the way of \u2018additional\nsustenance\u2019, the approach played\nout to perfection.\nSeveralopportunitieswerecarved\nout along with potential penalties\nfor blatant hand balls. Such was the\nconsistency of penalty claims that it\nwas clear the medical practice for\ntesticular cancer awareness was\nmerely to disguise their fondness\nfor fondling balls in the box. And it\nwas not long after the restart that\nthe ball was scrambled into the air\nbefore falling to the head of Chris\nKillin to nod towards a scarcely\ndefended net, only for a deliberate\nhand ball to deny us the lead.\nInevitably a penalty was awarded\nwith their player narrowly escaping\na red. Mooknellay, whose penchant\nfor sea mammals can only be described by Hooke\u2019s Law, whereby\nnet much to our relief.\nWith 15 minutes to go, we eventually finished the game off when\nDamien broke down the left side of\nmidfield to carry the ball down the\nline before cutting inside to deliver\na devastating finish.\nThe Mook had the opportunity to\ncomplete the hat-trick when he too\nbroke free down the left leaving him\none-on-one with the keeper. Unfortunately he placed his shot almost\nas wide as some of his most recent\nconquests, who along with being\ncapable of whistling bass, bring a\nwhole new meaning to the \u2018Miss\nWorld\u2019 competition.\nKings eventually began to tire,\nwith their breathing becoming so\nheavy, even Hamish was getting\naroused. Their demoralised and\nout-classed disposition gradually\nstiffness is directly related to load,\nonce again calmly converted. Kings\npredictably pulled another goal out\nthe hat when a near post cross was\nflicked into the back of the net.\nThe referee, whose logic would\npersuade him to kill for a Nobel\nPeace Prize and whose grumpiness\nvoiced many a lonely night playing peek-a-boo with the one-eyed\nmonster started to get agitated as\nFrampton was shown the yellow for\nsome wholly deserved back chat.\nWe once again took the lead via\na free kick, lofted deftly into the\nbox by James from the right hand\ncorner of the box. Kings\u2019 offside\nploy backfired when several of our\nplayer came charging into the box\nwithout a Kings player in sight. The\nball ultimately came off Tim and\ncrept into the bottom corner of the\ndeveloped symptoms when Damien pulled away from the last man\nand chipped the keeper who made\nevery effort to play the man and\nwas subsequently sent-off. Several\nfurther yellows were awarded to\nthe opposition for their petulance\nbefore the final whistle.\nThe ten goal thriller did much to\nbolster our waning confidence and\nprovide an opportunity for me to\ndedicate this report to Mooknellay,\nthus ensuring my complete exile\nfrom 6th team football, and rank\nNo.2 in his hit list, behind Jamie\nOliver.\nAs if student humour is limited\nto crude innuendo and shallow\nprejudiced views based on ap-pearance. Shame on you! Besides,\nmatch reports aren\u2019t meant to be\nentertaining!\nMen\u2019s Football\nKCL Medics 5ths 4\nIC Men\u2019s 6th 6\nWomen\u2019s Rugby\nRoyal Halloway 12\nICUWRFC 15\nOh look, a sports team huddled around a table consuming beverages, how quaint\nThis week saw us driving to Egham\nto compete in our penultimate ULU\nleague game of the season. Our\nopposition: Royal Holloway, who\nturned out to be quite a large side\nand clearly unfit shown by their\nrequest for 30 minute halves! The\nmatch was played with uncontested scrums, after our lack of experienced props following injuries 2\nweeks previously in a clash against\nthe Royal Vets.\nThe game got off to a good start\nwith a kick from Roxanne and the\nfirst try being scored in relatively\nquick succession by Jess, who\nbroke free and ran the pitch to score\nin the corner of the try area. Score:\n5-0 to us. The kick back to us went\nfar down the pitch meaning fullback Jess had to run to collect it. At\nthis point she managed to kick and\nfumble with the ball, before falling\nover her own feet. Happily, the half\nfinished 10-nil up, after a brilliant\noff-load from Olga, allowing Louisa\nto run free and score, although next\ntime Louisa please score under the\nposts when there is no-one preventing you from doing so! The second\nhalf started off with a very clean\ncatch by Helen, allowing us to run\nback at them with some force.\nUnfortunately, Royal Holloway\nwere obviously looking to even the\nscore and fought back hard, managing to score and then convert a\ntry taking the score up to 10-7. This\nwas followed shortly by a second\ntry from the home side making the\nscore 10-12 to Royal Holloway. At\nsome point during the match, Roxanne expressed her feelings quite\nopenly to their coach, who was\nshouting very loudly from the sidelines and leading to a lot of confusion as to what the ref was or wasn\u2019t\nsaying! Thankfully, he calmed down\na bit following this outburst from a\nrather red-faced Roxanne.\nEight minutes towards the end of\nthe game, the Virgins were fighting back excellently, which led to a\nvirgin try from outside centre Zo\u00eb.\nScore: 15-12 with 5 minutes left to\ngo.\nThen followed a nerve-racking 5\nminuteswheretheVirginsmanaged\nto hold the home team away from\nour line in a strong contest for the\nmatch. Thankfully, the whistle blew\nfor full-time allowing ICUWRFC to\nrelax and enjoy the hard-won vic-tory, before heading off to the pub\nto celebrate and enjoy the free-food\nlaid on by Royal Holloway.\nOh look, a sports team huddled around a table consuming beverages, how novel\nNam Nguyen\n\n"
