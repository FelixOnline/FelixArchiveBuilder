    "content": "Harlington horror Le^ bian& and\nMany fresher s who attended trials at Harlington last\nweek will have been shocked at what they saw there.\nMany 'experienced' students at IC will also have been\nshocked and saddened. The reason-what appears to\nbe the terminal destruction of our playing fields. The\nexplanation-money.\nHarlington playing fields were built on a thick base\nof gravel. That gravel is worth many millions of\npounds. Streeters, experts in the field of gravel\nextraction, have been contracted to remove the\ngravel. For this, someone in College will receive up\nto \u00a33 million. After much argument and debate in\nSydney Harbour-Bridge's( name changed to draw\nattention to himself) year as Union President, we have\nnow been assured that these monies will be spent to\nbenefit student sport and athletic clubs at Imperial\nCollege. Fine?\nNo. Streeters ARE experts in their field. But to my\nknowledge, and I have inquired, they have never had\nto work under sports playing fields before. Their\nexperience is working agricultural land. They have\nwon awards for the land that they have relaid after\ntheir work. And after being given a personal tour by\nour dedicated grounds men at Harlington, of the area\nthat has been completed and relaid, Streeters should\ncertainly win an award for that too. Because we have\nthe flattest cabbage field I 've even seen, and I 've seen\na few of them. It's probably great for corn too.\nHowever, it is rubbish for hockey and cricket, the two\nsports for which that section of ground was to be\nused.\nThe pitches already relaid were intended for use this\nyear. They are clearly not ready. Many student\nrepresentatives had warned Imperial College that this\nwould be the case for several years now. Their\ncomments have been ignored by those handling the\ncontract from the IC end. The result is the loss of all\nbut one hockey pitch, one rugby pitch and two spare\nsoccer pitches.\nStreeters are clearly not meeting their obligations\nwith regard to the Harlington contract, and the\nreinstatement of pitches has been mismanaged.\nCollege must be made to realise that their students\nare suffering as a result of the delays. I anticipate that\nmuch of my time this year will be spent dealing with\nthis matter.\nMore fun next week.\nBenj Turner, Athletics Clubs Committee Chairman.\nGay\nBig Mac calls EG M The issue of loans has reared its ugly head again after\na long time of being out of the public eye.\nOn Friday 20th October, the White Paper on student\nloans will be coming up for discussion in the House\nof Commons. There has been little change in the paper\nsince its introduction in November 1988, though there\nhave been several feasibility reports on how to run the\nloans scheme.\nAn Emergency General Meeting (EGM) has been\ncalled to publicise the continuing action of Imperial\nCollege Union and to explain to those students who\ndon't already know the consequences of the\nintroduction of the present proposed loan scheme.\nThis will take place in the JCR on Tuesday 17th October at 1pm. The introduction of loans has serious consequences\nfor all students. Whether you're for or against the\nWhite Paper in its present form, it will financially\ncripple students in London and should not be accepted\ntherefore. Come along and find out.\nHaving had six years of the 'ins and outs' of being gay\nat IC, I thought I would write a few words for all of\nyou arriving here unsure of how to tackle your\nsexuality. Life at IC for, unfortunately, the majority\ncentres around the various College bars. With this\ntends to go the associated sexism and bigotry of a virtually all-male bar environment.\nSuch attitudes are driven by the participants own\nsexual frustrations and insecurities, and should\ntherefore should be ignored when making decisions\nabout your own life.\nThere are many people at IC who genuinely believe\nthat homosexuality is unnatural. It is through contact\nwith lesbians and gay men who are positive about\ntheir own sexuality that the attitudes of these people\ncan be changed.\nIn the long run it will be much better for you to come\nto terms with your sexuality; accept it and 'come out'.\nThe feelings of inner strength, self-respect and\nsecurity that come from this seemingly impossible act\nare very real indeed. Most of the excuses voiced,\ninternally or otherwise, tend to be of the form \"What\nwould X do/think/say\" (for X read mother, father,\nfriends, etc). Although it is very easy to pose and\nanswer these questions (usually negatively) most\nfriends and relatives when presented with the facts\nchange their long unquestioned attitudes. In some\ncases there are real difficulties involved in coming out,\nbut whatever the case either the Union's or ULU's Lesbian and Gay Welfare Officer should be able to\noffer support and advice. At present the Union post\nis vacant but will soon be filled. Until then the ULU\nLesbian and Gay Group meets on Thursdays in ULU\nand is a very easy group to attend. It is also far enough\naway from College for the less secure amongst you\nto stand virtually no chance of meeting\nacquaintances!\nParking permit lottery winners\nBribe cheques to be made payable to N.

    "content": "Lawn Tennis\nSo many of you have enquired about what\nmembership of the club entitles you to, so here are\nthe main details you need to know.\nMembership of the club allows play on the two\ntennis courts adjacent to Prince's Gardens. The\navailability of these courts is controlled by weekly\nbooking sheets to be found in the Sports Centre,\nwhich are posted every Monday. To book a court,\nenter your name and membership number in the\ndesired time slot on the sheet. No more than two\nconsecutive hours may be booked. Any booking\nwithout a membership number will be scrapped as of\nnext week-so do not say you have not been warned!\nTeam practice is on Sundays at 1pm, so if you\nhaven't been to a trial yet, this Sunday is your last\nchance. We have club afternoons on Wednesdaysthis is for social rather than competitive play.\nWe are arranging coaching for beginners\ncommencing in about ten days time. If you are\ninterested, please contact me as soon as possible as\nwe can only accommodate the first fifteen people who\napply for the first coaching session.\nTo join the club find us on the courts on\nWednesdays or Sundays, or send your name and\ndepartment with a cheque for \u00a35.00 made out to\n'ICUACC to Samia Saad, Biochem 3, via the\ndepartmental pigeonholes. A receipt and membership\ncard will be returned as soon as possible.\nThe club also has six grass courts at Harlington and\nclub members will be notified in the summer term\nabout when these are available.\nSee you on the courts!\nScuba\nDiving appeals to everyone wanting that little bit more\nout of life than the ordinary everyday existance. Not\nonly does diving provide adventure, but it gives a purpose to holidays which others, less fortunate, have\nto spend just lying on a beach.\nDiving is exciting, it's different and it's not difficult.\nModern diving equipment is light, comfortable to wear\nand easy to use. But you must know what to do, so\ncome along to the Underwater Club. We will provide\nfree training so you can dive safely. Come along to\nan introductory meeting on Tuesday 10th October in\nBiology room W2 (just through Beit Arch on your left)\nand to the 'Try an Aqualung' session on Thursday\n12th October to see if you really like it.\nAlternatively contact either David Roberts, Physics\n3 or James Derry, Chem Eng 2 via the pigeonholes.\nGliding\nFor a week at the end of August glider pilots\nrepresenting Universities and Polytechnics from all\nover the country come together to compete in a battle\nof wits and skill at the 1989 Inter-University Task\nWeek. Imperial College Gliding Club (ICGC) co-hosted\nthis year's event with Surrey University Gliding Club\nat our mutual base, Larham Airfield.\nLarham, a tiny village nestled in the unsuspecting\nHampshire countryside, is the site for one of the\nlargest gliding airfields in the country. ICGC rents a Octopush\nThe game of Octopush bares some distant\nresemblance to ice hockey but is played in a swimming pool. The goals (Gulls) are troughs placed\non the pool bottom at each end of the playing area.\nThe puck (Squid) is an 80mm dia x30 mm thick disc\nof lead. The stick (Pusher) is quite short (250-340mm long).\nThe game commences by placing the puck in the\ncentre of the playing area. The two teams then\nconverge from opposite ends of the playing area and\ntry to propel l the squid using only their pushers (not\ntheir hands or heads etc!) into the other team's gull.\nThere is an official book of rules (even though many\nplayers do not appear to have even looked at the first\npage) which basically outlaws al! those rugby tackles,\nadjustments of other players' equipment during play\netc.\nThe sport of Octopush, also known as Underwater\nHockey, originated in the UK in 1954 by Southsea\nBSAC (British Sub Aqua Club), as a 'fun exercise in\nthe winter'. The first rules were issued in 1967 and\nthe British Octopush Association evolved in 1976.\nThe game is now international with 2,500 males and\nfemales alone playing in the UK.\nOnce a goal is scored each team returns to its own\nend of the pool and the game is restarted as before.\nPlay continues for 15 minutes, there is then a break\nat half time and then play is restarted for the second\nhalf. If the bar is already open the duration of play may\nbe shortened to allow more drinking time.\nIf you would like to have a go turn up on a Tuesday\nor Thursday at 8pm at the Sports Centre pool with\na mask, snorkel and fins (if you have them). Beginners\nare welcome as long as you can swim.\nbunk-house on the airfield and this was to be home\nto nine pilots during the week; the rest of the\ncompetitors slept in tents or caravans.\nThe weather was good enough to allow competitive\nflying nearly all week and several remarkable flights\nwere made. In particular the Imperial College team\nentry, with Martin Jadkins in command, achieved a handicapped distance of nearly 300 kilometres in a two-seater training glider. This flight was to lead\ndirectly to their victory in the wooden glider class.\nImperial College was represented in the glass-fibre\nglider class by Nick Law, the ICGC captain. Although\nhe did not win he distinguished himself by reaching\nsome of the more inaccessible parts of the country\nand then landing there.\nAs well as the flying there was a treasure hunt car\nrally and plenty of evenings in the bar recounting the\nday's adventures. Gliding appears to share some of\nthe characteristics of fishing in this respect: as the\nbeer flows events become more and more dramatic.\nIf you would like to compete in next year's Task\nWeek, or just find out what a glider is, come along\nto one of our regular meetings on Thursday at 5.30pm in Aero 254. See you there.\nWater Polo\nWell you've blown it now (as the actress said to the\nBishop). Both free introductory swimming and water\npolo sessions are over.\nBut don't despair, if you haven't come along yet and\nwant to swim or play polo you can still join in. The\nclub will still give you one free training session,\nalthough the Sports Centre swimming charge will now\napply.\nThe club is open to everyone; students, staff, union\nlife-time members, AIFS etc. Membership is \u00a35 for\nstudents and AIFS and \u00a310 for everyone else.\nThe club is also operating a discounted Speedo\nswimwear service, so if you want any equipment\ncontact us asap via departmental pigeonholes: Malena\nZubcov, Chem 2 or Chris Cox, Mech Eng 3.\nPS. All ladies-due to response we are trying to\norganise a women only water polo session on\nWednesday evenings, between 6.30 and 7.30pm. Anyone interested should contact Malena Zubcov,\nChem 2.\nPage 11\n\n"

    "content": "FeliX Student Loans\nNext week is a black week for students. The\nGovernment's plans for 'Top up loans for students'\nwill be discussed in the House of Commons on\nThursday. This will be the beginning of the end of\nhigher education as we now know it. Since last year's student demonstrations, the press has defiantly\nignored the issue and will continue to until it can\npounce on a student versus police 'bloodbath' story.\nWhat disgusts me most is the bandwagon approach\nwhich is being taken up by some magazines. I received\na 'Time Out' press release this week, which dutifully\ninformed me of how outspoken the student special\nhad been on the subject of student loans. Of course\nit was; Time Out was all too happy to make an\nattempt at a 'one of the students,' approach in order\nto increase its student readership. But how much do\nthe tax paying top dogs at Time Out care? Damn all,\nI would say. I predict that they will give little coverage\nto the matter from now on. Don't forget that the Time\nOut student special which we all received was not on\ngeneral circulation: it was preaching to the converted\nwith no danger of offending a regular readership.\nCome on Time Out; give us more coverage in regular\nissues if you want us to buy you.\nWith the subject of student loans and preaching to\nthe converted I should like to make a plea to\neverybody. Don't just sit on your backside in the vain\nhope that you won't have to take out a student loan;\nmany of you will. The scheme is expected to start in\n1990/91. Its effects include a halt in the inflationary\nincrease in the student grant and the abolition of\nbenefits for students. This means that you, yes YOU,\nwill see your grant rapidly devaluing with an instant\nloss of Housing Benefit during term time and income\nsupport during the summer. If you don't want to see\nyourself and your predecessors in debt to the\ngovernment for years to come, write to your MP, and\nabove all tell your parents and their friends how\nserious the situation is. The first step you can take\nis to attend next Tuesday's emergency general\nmeeting in the JCR and discuss the Union's action on\nloans for this year.\nAs a final comment on the matter I suppose I ought\nto add the solution to 'active or passive student\nresistance,' to loans, which Price Waterhouse suggest\nin their feasibility study: 'careful marketing.'\nLife Science department\nCloser to home, I would like to know what the Life\nScience department thinks it is playing at with\nundergraduate timetables. Almost every Life Scientist\nI know has complained to me of the incompetence of\nthe department in this area (other areas will be\nmentioned next week.) Yet again they have\ntimetabled work during Wednesday afternoons, and\nthe rest of the week is just one huge guessing game.\nStudents are being expected to come into College\nwith no idea of when or where their lectures are likely\nto be and to happily trot around at the beck and call\nof academic staff. This is not good enough. The\ndepartment will inevitably claim that this is just a one\noff occasion, but it is not. They have messed their\nstudents around for the three years I have been here\nand I have yet to hear anything other than a pile of\nfeeble excuses and a heap of bureaucratic crap at the\nCollege's Board of Studies. If I had to blame one\nperson it would have to be Professor Anderson. This\nman receives this weeks 'conniving g it,' award for\nlong term conniving and shear officiousness. Most of\nthe students in the Life Sciences division will not have\nmet him, since he does not deign to speak to mere\nmortals. In the past he has been a large part of the\ndrive to eat away at the student union areas for his\ndepartment (well its research actually) and has\nrefused to meet with Union Presidents over the\nmatter. He has little thought for the students in his\ndepartment and is the prime candidate for the 'still in\nhis job because he's been here so long,' award. I look\nforward to his retirement.\nWeeks Hall lift\nAt last we have the name of one of those elusive men\nin the heavens of the College's estates section: Mr\nP Burridge. He was the man responsible for everybody\nwho had to carry all of their belongings up the stairs\nin Weeks Hall during Freshers week. Having hired\nSundance and Co. (yes they have returned), he was\nobviously quite happy to let them take their time over\ninstalling the lift in Weeks. Maybe he should have been\nin Weeks hall to help everbody carry their suitcases\nup to the top floor, instead of sitting on his backside\nin Sherfield whilst the boys from the magnolia stuff\ndrank tea and searched for the bit they had lost from\nthe lift.\nMeeting\nThere will be a meeting at 1pm today and a cheese\nand wine this evening at 7.30pm in the office.

    "content": "The Delator Column by Paul Shanley\nAlarm\nCall\nI was proceeding in an orderly direction down\nWimbledon Broadway last Monday lunchtime. It\nstruck me that there was a distinct lack of policemen\non the beat. During my hour darling in and out of\npedestrian traffic, I spotted one Bobby. One. In an\nhour. Not much cop is it?\nPerhaps, I surmised, this was due to a large bank\nb lag being perpetrated in Wimbledon Village. Perhaps,\nI pondered, this was due to large amounts of\npaperwork being attended to. Perhaps, I 've been\nwatching too much of The Bill lately...\nLater, I sat down to write this week's column. Five\nminutes into my labours, I heard a burglar alarm go\noff, not far away. Pen and paper in hand, I head off\nto investigate. Now this has happened before-same\nburglar alarm, you understand ll've got such\nthoughtful neighbours). The last time, I reached for\nthe telephone to ring Inspector Plod. (I'm reminded at\nthis point by a standard letter I received from\nWimbledon CID last time my car got broken into. The\nletter ends \u2014\"If you require the police in an\nemergency, dial 999\". The author of this amazing\npiece of text was presumably on second ment from\nViz, but I digress). On ringing the emergency services\nlast time, they informed me that unless the alarm had\njust gone off, they couldn't do anything and in any\ncase, I should contact my local Police station.\nThis time, I pre-emp ted them by ringing Wimbledon\nnick first. I was placed in a call queueing system\nsimilar to that used by the standard role model of\nefficiency, British Rail. My time in the queue was\ninterrupted at two minute intervals by a very bored\nvoice-\"Sorry to keep you\". After the seventh one\nof these, I decided I had been kept long enough and\nhung up. Time for Plan B \u2014Ring the big boys. My 999\nrequest was met with\u2014\"We'll send someone round\nstraight away.\" The alarm went off at 2.50. The 999\ncall was logged at 3.06. One policeman arrived,\nmercifully not on his push bike, at ten past four.\nNow I'm not Agatha Christie. I don't even possess\na doctorate in criminology. But I do know this. Any\nintruder breaking in to that property could have\nransacked the house, made himself a cup of tea,\nwatched The Young Doctors and still mad Q it over the\nback fence before the Boys in Blue arrived.\nSo, why the delay in responding to what is\npotentially a call requiring a rapid response? The Police\nand Criminal Evidence Bill (PACE), amongst its many\nfeatures calls for the prior it ising of crimes. This means\nthat, rightly or wrongly, bank robberies are considered\na higher priority crime than an old lady having her\nhouse burgled. Maybe this section of PACE has now\nbeen extended to cover not only the allocation of\nprecedence to clearing-up crimes but also to response\nspeed of reported incidents. I hope I'm wrong.\nMeanwhile, the alarm bells keep ringing.\nEyes down\nPrivate Eye appears to have taken a step nearer its\nattempt to quash the record damages set against it\nin the high court several months ago. The apparent\nback-down of Mrs Sonia Sutcliffe, wife of 'The\nYorkshire Ripper', in last week's appeal action seems\nto have added more weight to their request for a retrial.\nThere are clearly two issues at stake here-one on\neach side. The damages awarded to Mrs Sutcliffe are\nartifical ly high. They are damages that have been set\nby a jury influenced by awards made to Jeffrey\nArcher, Elton John and other victims of the tabloid\npress. The Private Eye libel, if indeed there was one,\ndiffers in that it has not wrecked someone's marriage\nor career. The harm done to Mrs Sutcliffe's reputation\nhas arguably not been caused by the libel, it has been\ncaused by the publicity surrounding her decision to\ntake the matter to court.\nThe damages are way out of proportion with what\nthe paper can reasonably be expected to afford. When\nThe Sun commits a defamatory act it can afford to\npay the cost because it has a readership of 5 million\ndaily. The Eye , on the other hand, has a circulation\nof 100,000 per fortnight. Quite a contrast.\nIn addition to what the paper can afford,.there is\nalso a moral issue when comparing the high court\naward with the amount of compensation given to the\nrape victims of her imprisoned husband.\nThat concludes the case for the defence. However,\nthere's another side to the coin. Private Eye has\nalways sailed pretty close to the wind. That is how\nit has made its name. It is guilty this time of gross\nnai vit y in repeating the allegations despite being\naware of the legal action pending for the original\narticle.\nOn a commercial level, it is guilty on a further count\nof stubborn ess. Former editor Richard Ingrams, and\nPeter Cook-both major shareholders-refuse to\nrelinquish control of The Eye by floating a percentage\nof shares on the Stock Exchange. This would recoup\nthis, and any future, libel damages in one fell swoop.\nIt seems that Lord Gnome and his faithful team would\nrather see the organ fold than abnegate their\nproprietorship. If that makes sound financial sense,\nthen I'm a banana.\nOpen secret Easy rider\nI had to admit to a wry smile last week on hearing that\na senior Sherfield official had been telephoned by\nSpecial Branch to aid in the vetting of a sabbatical\nofficer. This, it would transpire, is not uncommon. MI5\nheadquarters at Curzon Street hold the details of\nabout a million individuals in their database. All\nsabbatical officers are entered on such files, as a matter of course. That's not the funny part. What\namuses me is that even though the story was relayed\nto me first hand, I 've since spoken to half a dozen\nother people who had also heard it. It's refreshing to\nknow that even in these post-Spycatcher days, the\nsecurity organisations of the country, as well as those\nat Imperial, are still keeping up their high standards\nof secrecy.\nNews reaches my ears that Union Manager, Dave\nPeacock is practising for a new career as a National\nHunt jockey. 'Peaky', as he is known to his friends,\nwas riding through Hyde Park recently admiring all The\nQueen's horses (and all the Queen's men). Unable to\ncontain himself any longer, Peaky's normally sober\nsteed broke into full gallop. Luckily, a nearby\npoliceman was on hand to pull him to one side and\nissue a stiff caution. Rumours that the Union\nBookstore is to start a new line in sugar cubes, blinkers\nand horseshoes are said to be completely unfounded.\nJen Hardy-Smith is 94.\nPage 9\n\n"

    "content": "While the European Space Agency continues to build larger multi-stage\nrockets to lob 13 tonne satellites into space, an alternative is being used\nfor projects that do not need the sheer tonnage of a communications\nsatellite. Liz Warren investigates the lure of low cost mini-satellites, and\nthe legal nightmare of a space bonanza.\nCheap space\nThere are three main approaches to launching small\nsatellites. The first of these includes systems such as\nScout and LittLEO, which rely on tried and tested\nsolid-rocket boosters. General Technology Systems,\nwhich is about to start the design and development\nphase of the LittLEO system, estimates that it will\ninitially be lifting up to 750kg into low earth orbit and\ncould possibly lift up to 1250kg. The second type of launcher aims to launch\nsatellites from beneath the wings of a conventional\naeroplane. Orbital Sciences is the chief developer of\nthe Pegasus system, which will be launched initially,\nfrom a NASA B52 bomber. The company claims that\nlaunching from high altitudes will allow Pegasus to lift\ntwice the payload of a ground-based system and that\nlaunches will be possible from any airport capable of\naccommodating the launch plane. The first\ncommercial venture is scheduled for early Autumn this\nyear when it will launch satellites for the US Defence\nAdvanced Research Project Agency (DAR-PA) and\nNASA.\nA third alternative for micro satellites, those under\n150kg, is 'piggybacking' as auxiliary payloads on large\ncommercial launchers such as American Atlas and\nEuropean Ariane rockets. Most large rocket launchers,\nwhich can now lift three or four tons, have some spare\ncapacity which is normally made up by ballast\nmaterial. Ariane has developed an ASAP \\Ariane\nstructure for auxiliary payloads) platform which is\ncapable of carrying six 'extra' mini satellites with the\nmain payload.\nOther aspects of cheap access to space are being\ninvestigated by Surrey University. It has set up a commercial company, Surrey Satellites, which is\nlooking for ways to make not only the launch but the\nsatellite itself cheaper, for example by investigating\nthe use of off-the-shelf components in preference to\nmore expensive high specification components.\nThe main issue is whether the launch systems can\nreally deliver the performance being touted by\ncompany marketing divisions. Piggyback launchers\nhave already proved their ability to handle\nmicro satellites and Arianespace envisage up to three\nlaunch opportunities a year for small payloads. Small\ndedicated launchers have shown, through Scout for\nexample, that they can lift micro satellites into suitable\norbits. The use of conventional techniques in the\nlarger LittLEO systems or the planned Scout 2 should\nensure that launches are successful.\nThere are doubts from all sides of the industry\nhowever about Orbital Sciences' claims for Pegasus.\nDr Geoff Pardoe, Chairman of General Technology\nSystems reckons: 'Claims for an easy launch\ncapability look good on paper...but it's not that simple\nto just take up and launch.'\nPegasus also claims that it will be able 'to deliver\napproximately twice the payload to orbit of an\nequivalent ground-launched vehicle.' As Pegasus\noffers up to 400kg into low earth orbit, it will soon\nbe outstripped by the planned capability of LittLEO\nand Scout. Pegasus also offers up to 650kg on high\nspeed suborbital flights which has led to speculation\nthat one of their largest customers may prove to be\nthe US Department of Defense.\nOther problems that may arise with Pegasus\nparticularly, and other launchers to a lesser extent,\nconcern the legal responsibility for the satellites and\nlaunchers. Legal responsibility is enshrined in what is\nusually called the United Nations Outer Space Treaty.\nThis states that 'there shall be free access to all areas\nof celestial bodies' and that 'there shall be freedom\nof scientific investigation in outer space'.\nDespite this, only three nations, the USA, the UK\nand Sweden, have acted on any national legislation\ngoverning space. The increase in commercial ventures\ninvolving more than one state, particularly with\nprojects like Pegasus which Orbital Sciences hope to\nbe able to launch from any country, means that the\npresent legal framework will become inadequate\nunless the law is sorted out.\nAre these launch systems competitive? Principal\nbackers, General Technology, estimate that LittLEO\nwill cost less than \u00a310 million per launch and Pegasus\nis quoted at $68 million per launch. These figures are\nconsiderably lower than using a conventional launch\nvehicle: it is estimated that NASA will save more than\n$10 million by launching their experiments on the\nScout small launcher. The presence of new small\nlaunchers should also alleviate the backlog and delays\ncaused by the Space Shuttle crash.\nThe advent of a space plane could lead to even\ncheaper satellite launches and affect the market for\nthese systems, but that is considered a long term\nchange. General Technology estimates that it will\nhave launched between one and two hundred LittLEO\nrockets by the time a space plane becomes viable and\ndoes not see it as a commercial threat.\nThe interest that the companies involved with the\nlaunchers have received shows that there is a clear\nmarket for small, cheap satellite launchers, particularly\nin the scientific field. All the companies involved in\nsmall satellite launches feel confident that they can\nachieve commercial success. Describing the LittLEO\nsystem, Geoff Pardoe at General Technology Systems\nsaid, 'it will be the space van of the future, and we\nall know what a success Ford made of their transit\nvan.'\nThis\nyj eek \u2022 Animal rights campaigners have welcomed the\nlatest mano eu ve rings of the Brussels's Eurocrats. The\nEuropean Commission is to announce that it no longer\nrequires the use of the controversial LD50 test for\ndangerous chemicals. The test, LD literally meaning\nLethal.Dose, involves exposing animal subjects to the\nchemical until half of them die. An alternative fixed\ndose test will be used in future.\nBoth the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty\nto Animals and the British Union for the Abolition of\nVivisection claim that this is an important step forward\nalthough there are no signs of an immediate end to\nanimal experimentation.\n\u2022 Can women working at video terminals seriously\ndamage the health of their unborn children? It has long\nbeen suspected that the radiation emitted by such\ndisplays can damage foetuses but, as yet, there has\nbeen no conclusive evidence. The evidence may come\nfrom New York's Mount Sinai School of Medicine\nwhich has set up a \u00a32 million study of some 8000\nwomen who regularly use computers. 800 of these\nwill be studied closely for a year during which time,\nthe researchers hope, at least some will become\npregnant.\n\u2022 Environmentalists have filed a lawsuit against the\nAmerican Space Agency NASA over its Galileo probe\nto Jupiter. The probe, due to be launched from the\nSpace Shuttle, contains 100kg of a Plutonium Oxide\nfuel which could be released into the environment in\nthe event of a second Challenger disaster. The\nprotestors refuse to accept NASA claims that the\nprobability of another such accident is very low\nindeed.\nMeanwhile in Europe, the European Space Agency's spaceplane, Hermes, has hit more conventional\ndifficulties. It has had to be redesigned and should\nnow be launched in 1998, three years later than\noriginally planned. ESA is also planning a second star-mapping Hipparcus satellite to replace the one\ncurrently going around the Earth in completely the\nwrong orbit after its engine failed. Researchers believe\nHipparcus I is still usable but with a much lower\nresolution.\n\u2022 The LEP, the latest addition to the collection of\nparticle collider s at CERN has produced over 4000\nshort-lived Z \u00b0 particles since it was started two\nweeks ago. In pre-LEP times only 700 such particles\nhad been detected in all the other collider s in the\nWorld.\n\u2022 A car powered by Hydrogen gas has been revealed\nin Washington. The car, which is actually a modified\nMercedes designed and built in Germany, was being\nused by the World Resources Institute to publicise a report advocating the use of Hydrogen as a fuel.\nThe car stores its fuel in specially designed\nabsorbing cells and can reach a top speed of 105mph. However in the great alternative transport tradition\npioneered by the Sinclair C5, it has a working range\nof only 75 miles.\nPage 6\n\n"

    "content": "Rufus Isaacs, reviews Freshers week\nThat was the week that was\nThey came, they listened and they all jumped about\nlike crazy wild things. Another Freshers' Week over,\nand what a week! Whether you are an indie fan,\nZimbabwean brother, rock 'n' roller, jump-j iver, disco\nking, acid man, gambler or just enjoy a rib-tickling\nchortle, it was all there. Monday's New Year Party\nsaw the Katydids and the Sandkings in the Lounge\novercoming the technical problems to give two well\nreceived sets, and a great rendition of Pump it Up as\nthe Katydids encore. Upstairs the Wood Children were\n'listened to' by the crowd but with the arrival of The\nFour Brothers on stage, the rhythm flowed and the\nsoaring guitar melodies soon had people dancing.\nThose who went to the Comedy Night on\nWednesday were treated to three acts, with Ivor\nDembina as as com per e. Felix had some excellent\nviews on sex, drink and Stoke City F.C., followed by\nthe Crisis Twins who embarrassed each other using\nphotographs of their childhood {he did look like John\nCraven). The final act, Sean Hughes was definitely the\nhighlight with his Protest Blues Song and his futile\nattempts to stop the heckles. The show ended in\nchaos with a 'one-liner' shoot out between the\ncom per e and Jeremy (the people's poet), who\nsomehow got a fiver from the Crisis Twins for his\nefforts.\nAnd so to the pinnacle of the week, the Freshers'\nBall, where all three bands gave us double helpings\nof 'get up on yer feet and boogie' music. First off were\nDave Puppy & The Happy Dogs who soon had arms\nand legs flailing in front of the stage, followed by the\nJivin' Instructors in the Concert Hall. A jumpin' band\nwith a fine horn s a xion, blasting out a string of old\nfavourites and even getting the crowd on their knees\nto pray for forgiveness. At last the time had come for\n\"l iSHii P^:i the week's finale. Let's hear it for the Big Town\nPlayboys] What a band! What a qui ff! And we just love\nthat boogie-woogie piano! The perfect party band,\nthey steamed through an hour of rock 'n' roll, and\nwhipped the concert hall into a sea of twisting,\npulsing, jitterbugging bodies.\nThe new-improved, even more spectacular than\nthey used to be Ents Discos kept many feet gro ov in' when the brain was long past caring (many thanks to\nthe Rugby cocktails) and the films and casino kept\nothers awake.\nYet another sold out Freshers' Week over, and the\nEnts Crew are off for a week's rest on their Caribbean\nisland, but don't despair! We return next Wednesday\nfor the regular free disco in The Lounge Nightclub,\nfollowed next Friday (20th) by The Muscle Shoal, live\non stage in The Lounge. A gig not to be missed. Look\nout for the posters next week.\nFinally, a big thank you to all those people who\nhelped out last week, too numerous to mention (I can't remember all your names).\n\n"

And we all know that where you find\ntunnels, you find cockroaches, right? In fact the\ntunnels we live on top of are crawling with the things;\nmovement down there involves large scale crunching\nnoises and retching by the faint of heart. So, logically,\nwe could do a brisk business with life science\ndepartments up and down the country. Right? Right.\nIn view of this, the Biology Department, who are\ncurrently paying \u00a360 for seventy of someone else s adult roaches, must either be brilliant lateral thinkers,\nor real dick heads. Right? It isn't as if they would have\nto go far to find them; A visit to Rob Northey's kitchens in Sherfield would set them up for years. In\nfact, we might suggest that Rob should consider\nopening a new trading outlet.... So, if you have any\nspare cockroaches in your flat, hall, garret or slum;\nsend them through the internal mail to Professor Roy\nAnderson, Department of Biology. Assuming they\ndon't get nicked in the mail, he should be delighted.\nFour cheers for the Imperial College (Not Union)\nConservative Society, for their performance of a remarkable act of lip-buttoning, and their\ndemonstration of a real sense of humour which we\ndidn't think they possessed. This is the only possible\nexplanation of the fact that they haven't attempted\nto wring someones neck, since we cannot believe that\nthey are so unobservant as to have failed to notice.\nNotice what? Oh, well if you look at the front of about\none third of the booklets the little darlings gave out\nto the poor unsuspecting Freshers, you will find that\nsome naughty person has added the word 'Fascisti'\nto the Imperial College Crest. Who it was, we have\nno idea, but we would like to reassure our readers that\nthe Imperial College (Not Union) Print Unit has\nundertaken a full and far-reaching internal\ninvestigation, during which we found forty-three\ncockroaches and two pairs of scissors. If we find the\nculprit, we faithfully promise to be quite unkind to\nthem for at least five minutes.\nAnd at least five cheers for the hardworking\nmembers of the Exec, who are working their fingers\nto the bone on everyones behalf. Out of those, Dave\nWilliams deserves three or more for his selfless\ndevotion to duty. The latest example of this is his\ntremendous efforts in the bar. We have heard of many\nincidents, the most outstanding of which occurred\nduring the RCS bar night on the Sunday before\nFreshers' Week, when Mr Williams gave so much of\nhimself for such a large part of the evening that he\nactually collapsed in Beit Quadrangle after leaving the\nbar. Despite the heroic efforts of nearby RCS\nmembers, who attempted to put him into the\n'recovery position', but due to their own extreme state\nof exhaustion kept dropping him, he remained\ncomatose, and was only able to move the next day\nin a sort of lurch: He looked extremely ill. Speaking\nas members of the Union, we don't want to see\npeople making themselves ill by overworking on our\nbehalf. Of course, it might just be that Dave's problem\nis that he is a total piss head of the first order, might n't it?\nDear, sweet, gentlemanly old John Smith, that most\nmild mannered and diplomatic of college se crat aries, has been about to leave Imperial College for so long\nthat few of us really believe he will ever go.\nNonetheless, one day soon he will, and a number of\nSherfield officio s( and fascist i?) will find their lives\nsuddenly become quite exciting. It is a known and\nunspoken fact that Mr Smith is a form of job-security\nfor quite a few admin bod s who don't exactly get on\ntoo well with the Rector. In short, when he leaves,\nheads will roll. This may lead some of them to have\na go at beating Eric Ash to the draw, which brings us\nto the Registrar, Peter Mee. Rumour has it that he\nintends to leave with Mr Smith. As for the possibility\nthat if he didn't, he'd get the sack at Mach four, we\ncan neither confirm or deny.\nWe can confirm, in the interest of ending with a touch of humour, that the esteemed Rob Northey,\ndoubtless bored with his burger and cockroach\noutlets, applied for John Smith's job! Unfortunately\nwe don't know what the Rector said when he heard,\nbut we do know that Rob didn't get the job, which\nprobably bodes well for the future of the College, and\nmay indicate that the Honourable Rector is learning\nsense. Either that, or he recognizes a climber when\nhe sees one, and fears for his own position? Now that\nwould be something....\nAndy Bannister.\nThefirstcorrect entry out of the Editor's hat will win a crisp \u00a35 note\nDouble your grant\u2014win a fiver\nIn a parallel universe not so very far away, the fresher s are arriving at the Metric College.\nBy an amazing coincidence, a copy of Metric's student magazine Mickey has fallen through a hole in\nthe Space-Time continuum (left after maintenance\nrepaired the roof) and landed in the FELIX Office.\nWe were surprised to learn that their sabbaticals are\nalso called Neil, Di, Fiona and Dave.\nWe were more surprised to learn that their\nsurnames were McCluskey, Williams, Nicholas and\nSmedley and we were positively flabbergasted to\nlearn that, like our own s abs, one was fond of a bit\nof dance, one was female, one was Welsh and one\nsmoked like a chimney.\nBy carefully reading between the lines (it's a side-effect of using parallel printing presses) we found that;\n1.

    "content": "The\nAbyss\nQuestion : What do you get if you cross Alien, The\nPoseidon Adventure and Close Encounters Of The\nThird Kind ? Answer: The Abyss\nProduced by Gale Anne Hurd (also responsible for\nThe Terminator,Alien and Aliens), the story begins\nwith a team of civilian divers working in an underwater\noil-drilling habitat. They are pressed into service by\nthe U.S. Navy to rescue a stricken nuclear submarine.\nSounds promising, but beware of any film which\ndescribes itself as epic. The Abyss is an epic\nadventure which in plain English means that it was\nvery expensive to make and much of the plot is\nO.T.T.. Strangely, these are two of the film's better\nqualities.\nThe special effects are pretty neat; the alien is\nespecially stunning (it'sE.T. with wings, honestly!).\nIt's very difficult to spot the models from the real thing\nas most of the filming was actually carried out in\nmassive water tanks in Los Angeles.\nE.T. isn't the only thing which has been recycled.\nThe sets of the deep sea station look uncannily like\nsomething from Alien; these, combined with some\nvery nifty camera-work, result in a real feeling of\nclaustrophobia. Luckily the crew of the station don't seem to mind. They're a fearless lot who even manage\na nap after watching all the extras drown, the station\nflood and discovering that they have less than twelve\nhours to live. I should imagine that it would tire out\neven Rambo. The script writer (James Cameron)\ndoesn't seem to mind these little inconsistencies and,\nindeed, manages even greater degrees of bull.\nLindsey, the queen bitch of the station, sacrifices\nherself by drowning only to be revived in true\ncinematic style (i.e. the kiss of life and a couple of\nelectrodes) so that a couple of hours later she is\noperating like a computer. What a recovery!\nBut the most amazing recovery must be that of her\nmarriage with estranged husband, Bud, who is also\non the station. If they can get back together after all\nthe Abyss throws at them then I would be interested\nto know why their marriage failed in the first place.\nIf you can excuse these incongruities the action is\nfast-paced and never dulls until the very end; it should\nbe enjoyed particularly by fans of Gale Anne Hurd's previous films (also by those who like the p link p link sound of submarine sonar). It'll go down well at Hall\nvideo nights in six months' time when it reaches the\nshops.\nLike Bud said, \"It's got a sphincter rating of 9.5\".\nI would say it was nearer eight.\nJames Connolly gives a brief insight into the atmosphere of the Town and Country Club and Wedne\nCarmel concert.\nCarmel TOWN AND COUNTRY CLUB\nThe vast and stately Town and Country Club (Kentish\nTown tube) is well worth a visit. It's soaring roof, wide\nbalcony covered with tables and chairs which\novershadow the twin bars below, and generally\nancient decor lend an air of faded grandeur which\nreminds you of the flea pits of the thirties. The Bmovies have been supplanted by a pageant of bands,\nincluding Carmel, the reclusive band who are on a small tour to publicise the release of a fourth album\nSet Me Free.\nCarmel set out some years ago with songs ranging\nfrom Sally, a vivaciously somber mixture of jazz, R&B and social comment. It is more experimental songs\nsuch as St Denis, where ry th m reigns and everything\nunderlines a bare basic beat.\nWith Sef Me Free, Carmel is essentially unchanged.\nThe jazz is still there but seems to be regressing\ntowards soul and gospel. The innovative edge is still\npresent with new African influences in parts and\ninteresting ry th ms such as those in Life is Hard and\nWaterfall, where a controlled, bleak atmosphere\ncomes across.\nOn stage, they are entertainers as much as\nmusicians and Carmel sings the grimmest songs with\na wide grin across her face, and the result is elegant\nand restrained.\nJames Connolly.\n\n"

Some 40 protesters gathered on\nWhitehall outside Richmond House, the\nheadquarters of the DSS. The majority\nof the protesters were young\nhomosexuals and other high risk\nindividuals worried about their future\nin society should they contract the\ndisease. The main thrust of the protest\nwas against the reforms to the Social\nsecurity benefits, which severely\ndisadvantage sufferers of terminal\nillnesses. Since the reforms those\nunable to work through long term\nillness are only entitled to income\nsupport of \u00a324 per week. Independent\nmedical advice re com ends a diet for\nAIDS sufferers costing \u00a330 per week.\nDespite a heavy Police presence,\nincluding 8 mounted officers, the\ndemonstration was peaceful. A spokesman for ACT UP told FELIX \"The demo was very sucessful but the\nPolice acted like shits as usual.\" The\nonly trouble occurred early in the\nti\nprotest when traffic by the Cenotaph\nwas blocked. Following this incident 3\nprotesters lay down on the pavement to\ncause an obstruction. They were\nremoved to Bow Street Police station\npending charges. Witnesses reported\nthat the Police had been extremely\nviolent in removing the protesters. One\nman was kicked in the groin and a girl\nhad her face ground into the pavement.\nOne protester told FELIX afterwards\nthat when he complained to aW PC involved that she didn't need to treat\nthem like animals she replied 'Animals\ndon't take it up the arse, do they?'\nThe meeting broke up peacefully by\nabout 2pm and the protesters dispersed\nto avoid aggravating the Police. More\naction is planned by the group in the\nfuture including a picket of the\nAustralian embassy to protest at the\ncountry's introduction of random HIV testing.\nUnion to protest on loans\nImperal College Union (ICU) will hold\nan Extraordinary General Meeting on\nTuesday 17th October at 1pm in the\nJunior Common Room.\nThe meeting is to discuss action\nconcerning student loans. The House of\nCommons is to discuss the bill on\nFriday 20th October. Union President,\nNeil McCluskey, intends to ask students\nto contact their own MPs and to make\nappointments to see them to argue\nagainst the introduction of such loans.\nIC Union hopes to arrange a lobby\nof Parliament next Thursday with the\nLondon branch of the National Union\nof Students (NUS) sending a delegation\nof students on Friday to talk to MPs. The University of London Union\n(ULU) will not be taking part as a whole, though members will be\ninvolved.\nThe NUS will be taking buses of\nstudents up to Manchester to support\ndemonstrations there, under the title\n'Fight for the Right to Study' on 18th October. On October 19th NUS( National) will be presenting a petition\nto MPs at Westminster. A 'Loans Week\nof Action' will be organised for\nNovember 6th until November 10th. NUS hope to set up an 'Education\nShutdown' on November 16th after\nnegotiating with trade unions.\nOn November 29th the NUS aim to\norganise a march through central\nLondon, from the UL U building in\nMalet Street to the Imperial War\nMuseum. The march is still subject to\nPolice approval.\nMost London colleges are supporting\nthe NUS lobby on the 19th. Carol\nHinbest, Vice President for Welfare at\nQueen Mary's College, said she would\nwrite to academics at her college asking\nthem to write to their MPs opposing the\nloans. The principal of Queen Mary's is to write a letter opposing loans to\nstudents' parents.\nThe Polytechnic of Central London\nis mounting a 'Loan Busters' campaign\nto gain media attention.\nCity University is supporting the\nNUS (London) lobby of Parliament on\nthe 19th. They may support the NUS national demonstration on November\n29th if it goes ahead. The NUS is in the\nprocess of deciding whether to hold a strike at further education colleges in\nthe future. Pickets of colleges may be\na possibility, said a spokesman. The\nNUS will hold demonstrations and\nmarches near the time of the Queen's Speech in November, when the Queen\nwill state the Government's legislation\ndiary for the next Parliamentary\nsession, which will include the Student\nLoans Bill.\nThe Rector of Imperial College,\nProfessor Eric Ash, told FELIX that he\nfelt grants 'wholly paid for by the State\nare no longer tenable' and that the\n'erosion of that idea was inevitable'. He\nwent on to say that details on student\nloans were not known and that he could\nnot 'shoot at a vague target'. He added\nthat the loans proposal 'helped too\nlittle'.\nOn being asked whether he would\ntake action similar to the principal of\nQueen Mary's College Professor Ash\nsaid he had 'not so far thought of that;\nI think the greater attack on the\neducational system is that of fees'. The\nCommittee of Vice Chancellors and\nPrincipals eventually approved the idea\nof introducing student fees in the future,\nthough Professor Ash voted against this\nsaying this idea was 'diverging from\nEurope.' Education in this country\nwould become too expensive for\nstudents because of their having to pay\ntheir own fees, and they would, for\ninstance, choose to 'study in Paris', he\nadded.\n(\"D Issue 845\nFriday 13th "

    "content": "Apologies\nplease\nDear Mr Smedley,\nI am writing to ask that you publish an apology in\nthe next issue of FELIX to Dr Jan Bradley, the previous\nwarden of Willis Jackson House. In the article that\nappeared on the back page of your recent issue, your\npaper misquotes my recent telephone conversation\nwith one of your reporters and hence imparts part of\nthe blame for the overspend of our amenities account\non Jan Bradley. In the telephone conversation I recall,\nI stated that the overspend was not as high as \u00a3750,\nbut more like \u00a3550, owing to the fact that the\naccounts department had mixed up account numbers\nbetween Linstead (Jan's new tenure) and Willis\nJackson, and some of their expenditure had been\ncharged to our account. I have now recouped this\n'lost' income. As a point of fact, which you may quote\nme on, Jan left the Willis Jackson amenities account\nin good shape with a small surplus. I do sincerely hope\nyou will recognise the anxiety caused to Jan by your\nmisinterpretation of facts and redress the slur to her\nexcellent stewardship of Willis Jackson House as soon\nas possible.\nYours sincerely,\nJoe Cartwright.\nI have spoken to the reporter in question, who\nassures me that you did say the Willis Jackson\naccount was in debt. I feel that you owe Jan\nBradley an apology. FELIX did not misquote you;\nyou have entirely altered what you said with the\nbenefit of hindsight.\nI must also assume that you admit to my\naccusations of your creaming it off the students\nin your care, since you have failed to raise this\npoint in your letter.\nEd.\nMalcolm\ndenies\nall\nDear Dave,\nOlave House\nI fear that your front page article gives a very\nmisleading impression about the College's proposals\nfor the management of Olave House. The editorial\nmakes matters worse. (FELIX 844, Friday 6th October.)\nThe College will honour its promise and the Rector\nhas specifically asked me to say that he has personally\nalways insisted that Olave House be kept entirely\nseparate from other residences. The purchase of\nOlave House will not result in rent increases for other\nresidences. I thought I had made this clear when you\ninterviewed me last week.\nThe Olave House accounts are maintained in a watertight compartment, preventing cross subsidy by\nother residences. The effectiveness of these\narrangements will be plainly visible to the elected\nstudent representatives on the Students Residence\nCommittee, just as it is at present for Wilson House.\nIt is most important that your readers-and their\nelected representatives-appreciate that there is\nmuch more to the Students Residence Committee\nthan determination of rents. There are many issues\nof general management and because the same\norganisation is used to manage Olave House, head\ntenancies and Wilson House as College halls and\nhouses obviously there are some issues which affect\nthem all.\nYours sincerely,\nMalcolm Aldridge,\nRector\nreplies\nDear Dave,\nI had missed your comment on the students from\nChina in the Freshers' edition. It was only when, in\nthe last issue, I read your apology (for which of course\nI am grateful), for having called me a 'conniving g it', that I looked back and found it.\nThe impression you have of the economics of\nrecruiting overseas students is widely held-but\nfactually wrong. In the case of an overseas student\nthe financial contribution comes in the form of fees.\nIt is important to appreciate that these cover only\nabout 75% of the actual cost, the rest being\ncontributed by the UK taxpayer. In the case of UK\nstudents only a small part of the financial contribution\nis in the form of fees-the remainder is paid as a component of the block grant which we receive from\nthe UFC. The situation is complicated, not least due\nto the fact that our UFC block grant is devised on a formula which is not revealed. However we know\nenough. Looked at purely as a financial proposition,\nthe College is no better off by recruiting one additional\nperson from Beijing than from Brighton.\nOur aspirations in recruiting students are simple to\nstate: we want the best\nYours sincerely,\nWith kind regards,\nEric Ash.\nCommon\nsense\nDear Dave,\nI am writing to you to highlight what I feel is a growing and disturbing trend at IC, namely the\ngrowing extremism of the various political groups. It's hard to know who to start with but it's certainly\neasiest to start with the Imperial College Conservative\nSociety. They obviously feel that to use the word\n'Union' in their title (or in their handbook, or on the\ndisclaimer for the above 'fascist i' organ from Imperial\nCollege Union Publications) would taint their bluer\nthan blue, \"We love the PM\" image. This is despite\nthe fact that they are part of the Union and their\noperations are funded by the Union.\nIt is interesting to note that the Government which\nthey so adore has recently commissioned a survey to\ninvestigate student unions' spending on political\nactivities. Unfortunately this survey found that\nstudent unions only spend around 0.5% of their\nturnover on political activities, so the DES buried the\nidea. Either way, Consoc are spending the Union's money promoting their own political garbage, money\nwhich could be better spent elsewhere. They are not\nthe only culprits; Socialist Workers Student Society\nare just as bad, only they try to paint the world a different colour.\nThere is a lot currently happening in the student\nworld, and we will all be worse off if either of these\ngroups (or any like them) attempt to hijack things on\nthe external front. One suggestion is to round them\nall into a field and nuke the bastards, but this is not\nthe way of moderation. It is my belief that a student\nunion should have no set political affiliation (IC\nConservative Society believe in a national body of\nstudents but not the NUS, maybe because the NUS\nsupport the Labour party and not the glorious blues)\nbut should decide its political stance as and when\nstudent issues occur, and represent the feelings of the\nstudents at that time. This is particularly relevant now,\nas we are having are fur end um on the NUS this year,\nwhich both factions will try to bully in on, and, as they\nare not that keen to recognise their membership of the\nunion, kicking their societies out of it would probably\ndo everyone a favour, so that everyone else can get\non with some sensible (and legal) campaigning on\nissues such as financial support and welfare for\nstudents. As you may have gathered, I am neither a 'leftie' or a 'Thatcherite' but rather someone with a bit of common sense and, while I would be the first\nto agree that there can be no way that our union can\nbe 'apolitical' and stick its head in the sand, common\nsense should prevail.\nYours sincerely,\nHal Calamvokis.\nOLD CENTRAL IAN S invite you to a Careers Reception for Graduating Students\n6.00-8.30pm, Thursday 19 October\nSenior Common Room, Sherfield\nThis is an ideal opportunity to discuss career\nprospects in most engineering disciplines and\nmanagement, with OCs and their guests.\nWine and light refreshment will be served.\nTickets are free to members and \u00a31 for non-members, and should be obtained from the Old\nStudents' Association Office (Room 303,\nSherfield) by Tuesday 17th October)\nA concert to\nhelp Chinese\npeople...\nTICKETS ON SALE NOW!\nIn aid of The Chinese Students\nRelief Association\n7.30pm Sunday October 15th1989 Great Hall, Imperial College\n\u00a35.00 (\u00a32.50 for students)\nFa-Fa Jin conducts\na selection of music by\nTchaikovsky, Vaughan-Williams,\nChopin, Shostakovich, A 'Bing\nYou can obtain tickets by sending a cheque (payable\nto CSRA) and a SAE to 24 Couttside, Dartmouth\nRoad, London SE26 4RE.

    "content": "UL U sabbaticals in staff-strife\nThere are indications of friction between elected\nsabbatical officers and members of permanent staff\nat the University of London Union ( UL U) over\nroom bookings within the UL U Building.\nImperial College Union (ICU) sabbaticals were\nled to believe that a 'get together' held last\nWednesday night in Palms Wine Bar in the UL U Building was 'a protest to demonstrate solidarity\nbetween London sabbaticals'. They were not\naware until they reached the party that it was to\ncelebrate the 21st birthday of a sabbatical from\nthe London School of Economics.\nMembers of the Union were told by ICU Deputy\nPresident Dave Williams on the way to the party\nthat it's a case of when a club tries to book a room\nthey are told that if they turn up on the night and\nthe room is free they can use it, but that they won't guarantee not to let it if an outside booking comes\nalong.\nThe ruling on room bookings within the UL U building, according to Rachel Wilson, UL U Conference Booking Officer, who is responsible\nfor arranging room bookings, is that ' all recognised UL U societies get one room in the\nbuilding per week for their meetings. If they want\nmore and I can fit them in they can have that.'\nShe said that she had had 'no negative feed back\nfrom any student' and that her 'priority was to\naccommodate students'.

The in aug ral conference of NAM S was held on\nSeptember 22nd24 th at which 26 out of the 29\nBritish medical schools were represented. Up until\nnow medical schools have avoided political\nconnections. Rhydian Hapgood, President of St\nMary's Student Union, said 'we hope it will\nresolve a lot of issues'. He explained that NAM S intends to act through lobbying and through\nstudents' parents.\nThe executive of NAM S includes Nick Stafford,\nAccommodation Officer of St Mary's last year.\nTiddlywinks\nTiddlywinking down Oxford Street raised \u00a32,100\nfor Action Aid last Saturday. Carol Luscombe,\nPresident of the Royal College of Science Union\n(RCSU), claimed that the RCS had raised \u00a3971\nof the total.\nHal Calamvokis said that collecting was harder\nthan last year and there were less shoppers about.\nLast year participants raised \u00a32,500.\n'It was a bit of a disorganised shambles which\nwas my fault,' he added, 'This Saturday will be\nmuch better'.\nA giant Monopoly game will be played over the\nwhole of London this Saturday.\nRugby theft\nMembers of Imperial College's1st and 2nd Rugby\nteams returned from their first training session on\nTuesday to find that about \u00a32,000 worth of\npersonal belongings had been stolen.\nThe items stolen included watches, cash and\ncredit cards which were put in a locker in the\nchanging room in the Union Building. There were\nsigns that an implement similar to a screwdriver\nhad been used to force a locker.\nTeam members commented that at least two\nnon-rugby players were in the changing rooms at\nthe same time that they had changed.\nThe brick re-surfacing of Imperial College Road\nis to cost over \u00a3105,000. So far bricks have been\nlaid between the Biochemistry building and the\nLyon Playfair library.\nMr P Burridge, Contracts Manager, said this\nwas 'part of the project to gently improve\nroadways in the College'. He explained that the\nprice 'compared favourably' to the cost of laying\nthe bricks around the Civil Engineering\ndepartment.\nWeek lift\nThe delayed installation of a new lift in Weeks\nHall inconvenienced students moving in at the\nbeginning of this term. The old lift was removed\nin July, and the new lift should have been in place\nby the end of September. The lift is not in full\nworking order yet.\nMr Simon Walker, warden of Weeks Hall noted\nthat 'of course when the students came in with\ntheir luggage we had middle-aged parents slaving\nlike sherpa s up eight floors'. He also commented\nthat the lift has been getting steadily more decrepit\nfor twenty years and the work could have been\nstarted earlier in the summer.\nMr P Burridge, Contacts Manager, who was\nresponsible in part for hiring ERS (Elevator Repair\nServices) to do the work explained that there had\nbeen problems installing the lift as a missing part\nhad to be found.

UL U Vice President (Services), Steve Hopwood claimed\nthat the party was simply to 'celebrate the LSE sabbatical's birthday' and that it had 'no ulterior\nmotive'. He said that any stories of staff problems\nwere 'gross misrepresentation' and added that he\n'didn't feel UL U had any problems whatsoever'\nwith its permanent staff.\nUL U have a staff protocol that forbids\ndiscussion of staff matters without the presence\nof the member of staff concerned.

    "content": "Armageddon days are here\nMind Bomb is the third offering from The The in little\nless than a decade. For this album Matt Johnsone has\nchosen to go for the more traditional, band image with\nex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr joining the band.\nFor anybody who is familiar with the previous\nalbums, Soul Mining and Infected, the musical style\nis un mistake able. The most noticeable thing is the fact\nthat the album is listenable and truly easy on the ears.\nMany of the tracks are cleverly mixed so that they\nfollow well, clearly a great deal of work has been put\ninto sound engineering.\nIf any one track were to stand on its own it would\nbe Armageddon Days are Here Again which is the\nlatest single release. Written a week before the\nSalman Rushdie affair, the track is true prophecy\nindeed. A definite anti-religious stab is felt from this\nsong, which is, without doubt, a lyrical masterpiece.\nThe other tracks hold their own with some\nextremely clever use of instruments especially the\npiano on Kingdom of Rain and August and September.\nThe album ends in typical Matt Johnsone fashion\nwith a heart felt piece called Beyond Love where some\nvery clever guitar work, similar in style to Marillion's Steve Rothery, combines with powerful vocals to\nremind us that all is not well in the human jungle.\nEssential listening for all The The fans and anybody\nwho appreciates innovative rhythms and powerful\nlyrics. The thinking man and woman's pop.\nN.E. M.L. Delicate sound of depression\nThe last few months have seen the release of two\nvideos from those ageing hippies of the 70's Pink\nFloyd.\nThe Delicate Sound of Thunder is the visual followup to the album of the same title released last year.\nNot surprisingly the soundtrack, if not slightly\ntampered with, is virtually identical.\nSeveral tracks on this video are not present on the\nalbum and this will serve to encourage all Floyd fans\nsearching for the definitive live Floyd collection to buy.\nThe quality of this video is excellent. Shot on 35mm film and recorded on 48 track digital stereo, the film\nsadly loses something in the transfer to video format.\nDespite this, there is a troublesome lack of interaction\nbetween the band and the crowd. What is more\nworrying is the real lack of true representation of the\nstunning light show. The band was quoted as saying\n\"The fans come to see the light show not us\", so why\nare we subjected to overlays of Dave Gilmore's ugly\nmug upon the megawatt lighting show?\nDespite this there is no mistaking the true quality\nof this product. At \u00a311.99 this is a bargain buy for\nany Floyd fan. It would have been nice though if the\ntrue atmosphere of the gig had been extracted\nespecially as 200+ cameras were used.\nReleased last month on the Channel Five label is the\nlong awaited budget video release of Alan Parker's film adaptation of Pink Floyd's The Wall.\nThis film is, to say the least, shocking! We are\ntreated to 100 minutes of visually nightmarish and\ngruesome scenes coupled with the powerful and, at\ntimes suicidal, music of Floyd.\nIn many ways autobiographical of Roger Waters'\nlife, the central character is Pink played by Bob\nGeldoff. Sitting in an armchair watching the war film\nDam Busters, our hero reflects on his life: losing his\nfather in the war, being over protected by his mother,\nlosing his wife to a CND activist and finally his total\nhatred of the rock business and all that it stands for.\nHe then loses himself down a spiral stairway to\ninsanity becoming the leader of a totalitarian state\ndisturbingly similar to George Orwell's1984 and Nazi\nGermany, with two hammers crossed in defiance\nreplacing the s was tica. The final scenes see Pink having to face himself at\na trial charged with showing human emotions, where\nspectre s of his past teacher, wife and mother try him.\nThe animation is directed by Gerald Scarfe. Since\ngruesome is the best word to describe this film it is\nnot for the faint hearted and should be watched at\nyour own peril. Essential viewing for all drug addicts\nand anybody who likes being depressed to the limits\nof human emotion.\nN.E. M.L Page 3\n\n"

Stude Food\nYes indeed, apart from poverty, depression and\nNeighbours the thing which unites all s tudes is food.\nUnless you are an Oxford/Cambridge non-s tude, then\nonce you've finished the brown paper bag of\nsandwiches mummy made for your train journey to\nCollege, you are left with the realisation:\n\"Bugger me! No one's made my dinner\" and you\nhead for as tude kitchen. The most remarkable point\nof as tude kitchen is the s tude fridge. No one has\nexperienced a true anarchist state until they have\nshared a fridge. Many do not realise that on writing\n'John Bloggs' on the side of a milk carton and putting\na mark at the level of the milk, they are not saying\n'This is my milk' but 'It is I who contributed this to\nthe communal milk collection'. Anyone who puts \u00a330\nworth of goodies in a fridge not fitted with a padlock,\nalarm, r ottweiler guard dogs and embedded in\nconcrete is doomed to wander the kitchen for the next\nweek saying 'Isn't that my pie/egg/butter/stuffed\nquail?' to which the answer is invariably 'No'.\nThose experienced s tudes who leave hall to share\nflats often have equally naive ideas. Picture this: Day\n1 in flat, the speaker an altruistic busy-body: '\nI say\nchaps let's organise a cooking/washing-up rota.'\nEveryone else: 'Yes, yes the work will be easier if we\ndivide it.'\nA fortnight later: 'I'm not cooking tonight, I cook\nchicken cordon bleu, veal cutlets and nightingale's tongues, and all you bastards do is hamburgers.'\n'f*** you!

However, this could change this year\nwhen Imperial College Union holds its planned ballot\non NUS re affiliation. I and many others believe that\nImperial should not affiliate to the NUS and I'd like to\ntell you some of the reasons why.\nIf we decide to re affiliate to the NUS, in exchange\nfor a large slice of Imperial College Union funds every\nmember of ICU will become a member of NUS\n(whether they want to or not] and will receive certain\n'benefits' in return.\nUp until December 1984 NUS operated a system\nof individual membership for students at non-affiliated\ncolleges, but so few students joined that this became\na great embarrassment to the NUS and was stopped.\nIt is very difficult to leave NUS once you are a member, many students' unions require a two-thirds\nmajority to d is affiliate from NUS and this is very\ndifficult to achieve when most students are quite\nrightly more interested in enjoying themselves and\ngetting a good degree than getting involved in Union\naffairs. Why shou d the activist minority be allowed\nto speak for and spend the money of the silent\nmajority?\nThe normal NUS argument is \"if you don't like NUS,\njoin us and change it from the inside\". Normal\nmembership of NUS lasts for three years for most\nstudents so it is hard for them to change things, yet\nit is run by extreme left-wing professional 'students'.\nTwenty-eight year old Maeve Sherlock graduated in\n1984 and yet is enabled by NUS regulations to\ncontinue being president up until 1990, and her\npredecessor, Vicky Phillips graduated in 1983 and\nwas NUS president for five years.\nWhat will NUS spend your money on? A hefty\nproportion goes on conferences. \"Every conference\nthere is intimidation and violence...Too many of the\nleft groups use violence and a gres sion as a tool. These\ngroups are grossly over-represented...The ability of\nordinary delegates to participate is difficult. This\nemanates from the structure of debate but also from\nthe intimidating atmosphere of Conference floor.\"-SDP Students. NUS shows great contempt for free\nspeech and NUS conferences are not a safe place to\nbe if you do not hold the 'correct' political views. Over\nhalf the delegates who attend NUS conferences are\nfrom colleges of further education and do not need\nto be elected, hardly 'democratic'. There are also\ndonations to such worthy causes as miners' strike\nfunds and the National Abortion Campaign and\nsupport for such organisations as CND and the\nNational Lesbian Custody Campaign. NUS also\nrefuses to condemn the IRA, however it has sent\npublic condolences to Mairead Farrell, one of the IRA\nterrorists shot in Gibraltar by the SAS, and the NUS\nPresident Maeve Sherlock, is on the Editorial Board\nof 'Labour and Ireland' the journal of a group that\nsupports Sinn Fein and is also a patron of the 'Time\nto Go' movement.\nWhat 'benefits' will the average student get from\nNUS? Well there's the National Student Magazine,\nwhich has published such well balanced and\ninformative articles as \"Thatcherism, Vote-Catching\nBlood-Lust in the South Atlantic\", or its forerunner\nNational Student which in December 1986 published\na detailed recipe for making crack which it described\nas \"staggeringly pleasurable\". NUS provide ISIC\n(International Student Identity Cards) which they\nforget to mention are available to any u one over the\n'Most students are quite rightly more interested in enjoying themselves....than getting involved in Union affairs.\n'Every conference is intimidation and violence....'\nage of fourteen. They also claim to provide welfare\nservices, when in fact all they do is contact an agency\nor charity operating in the relevant field (eg Shelter\nor the Citizens' Advice Bureau), these services could\nbe obtained independently by any students' union for\nonly a couple of hundred pounds. They provide\ntraining for sabbatical officers for an extra cost above\nthe standard affiliation fee, these services are widely\ncriticised as being expensive and unprofessional,\nindeed Liverpool University withheld half its 1985/86\naffiliation fee because of this complaint. NUS Travel\nwent bankrupt in 1976 with debts of \u00a350,000 and\nin the same year NUS sold Endsleigh Insurance to\nGouda of Holland. Discounts at shops, theatres,\ncinemas and so forth are available to all students, not\njust NUS members. Finally we have the claim that\nNUS represents students at a national level, however\ntheir demands are so outrageous and they have so\nlittle credibility that nobody listens to them, since\n1962 there has been a35% decrease in the real level\nof student grants under governments of both political\npersuasions, hardly a successful record.\nThings are different at Imperial College, and we\nwant them to stay that way. We have an excellent\nwelfare service, our sabbatical officers are on the\nwhole very professional and actually care about the\nstudents instead of caring about their own political\ncareers, we get all the discounts on offer to other\nstudents in London and we don't get extremist politics\nrammed down our throat. I have had friends from\nother London colleges who have visited Imperial and\nare amazed by the wealth of clubs and societies we\nhave and the lack of left-wing pro pog and a. We will have to fight this year to prevent ICU\naffiliating to the NUS, and as with all NUS d is affiliation and re affiliation campaigns it is going to be dirty and\nit is going to be hard for us to compete against the\nlarge and professional propaganda machine. We have\na lot to lose if our college re affiliates to NUS, indeed\nNigel Baker (Imperial College Union President\n1988/90) has called the prospect of NUS re affiliation 'financial suicide'. The budgets of many ICU clubs and\nsocieties have been savagely cut this year, but this\nis nothing to the cuts that will be necessary if we have\nto pay NUS affiliation fees as well.\nICU should stick to helping students, not playing at\npolitics, and Imperial College students should have\ntheir money spent on them, not on financing the\npolitical careers of left-wing extremists.\n7\n\n"
