    "content": "Letters FELIX, Friday June 12th19872 The one we\nhad to print\nDear Dave,\nI was appalled by the Rector's comments in \"The Ash Interview\"\n(FELIX 773) regarding FELIX.\nWhereas I am totally opposed to the\npublication of anonymous letters, or\nletters written under a pseudonym (eg\nlast year's letters written by ' 'Spock''\nand \"James T Kirk\"), I see nothing\n\"diabolical\" in asking the Editor to\nwithhold the name or names of the\nauthors. I say this for two reasons:\nfirstly, if I had to make as serious a complaint about my department as the\ngroup of Civ Eng PGs had to make\nabout theirs, I would rather not be\nsingled out so that other people could\npoint their finger at me and say \"He's the one who complained\" or \"He's the one who aired the dirty laundry\nin public''. Secondly, the Rector may\nwell say this is a free society; but the\ngroup of anti-Khomeini Iranian\nstudents who wrote to FELIX some\nmonths ago to inform us of the\natrocities committed in Iran in the\nname of Islam have every reason to\nfear reprisals from the pro-Khomeini\ncamp. It is only fair that these students\nshould be allowed to express their\nviews without endangering their\npersonal safety.\nProfessor Ash's other criticism of\nFELIX, that it is too full of 'in-jokes'\nand material which, according to him,\nis \"not likely to be of enormous\ninterest to more than about five per\ncent of the students, is nonsense. I cannot imagine what this material\ncould be, nor who this mysterious five\nper cent of the IC student body is.\nApart from the occasional (and very\nfunny) episode of \"The Baron of\nCheapskate\", there is very little in the\nway of gossip and jokes about the\nUnion officers, as the infamous (but\nalso very funny) \"Below the Belt\"\ncolumn is now defunct. If anybody\nout there agrees with the Rector\nsimply because they keep seeing\nreferences to \"John Smith\",\n\"Michael Arthur\", \"Brian LloydDavies'' and haven'ta clue who these\npeople are or how they can affect our\nlives at IC, they have only themselves\nto blame. After all, you only have to\nread FELIX each week, or even (dare\nI say it) attend the odd UGM to know\nexactly who these people are and what\nthey did, do and will do.\nAs for the Rector's suggestion that\nFELIX should be devoting its time\nand space to \"looking at the role of\nImperial College in the country at\nlarge\", I would say that that is not\nits raison d'e tre; the assessment of\nICs role in the country is, in the main,\nCollege's responsibility and they\nshould not expect the newspaper of\nImperial College Union to be doing\nit for them,\nYours sincerely,\nAlastair J Seymour\nKing Arthur\nNearly four years ago former FELIX\nEditor Pallab Ghosh launched his first\nissue with a scathing attack on\nMichael Arthur, who was Student\nServices Officer at the time. Pallab\ncalled Mr Arthur the ' 'most arrogant\nand unhelpful College official it has\nbeen my misfortune to come across''.\nThere was no particular reason for\nthis, except that Pallab wanted to\nmake FELIX fun to read and Michael\nArthur had given him a hard time\nover his second year rent bill.\nToday Michael Arthur works in\nCollege administration \"headquarters\" and has responsibility for\nstudent affairs such as\naccommodation. After a year of\ntrying to get useful information out\nof this man I have realised that he is\nthe biggest bullshit terI have ever met.\nMr Arthur's meddling in Union\nfinances, through his patronage of the\nboat club, is quite out of order. To\nsummarise, if you did not get the full\nposition from our news stories, the\nboat club approached Michael Arthur\nfor financial help when the Union\nmade it clear that there could be no\n\"advance\" on next year's five year\nplan money. Mr Arthur put up the\nneccessary funds to buy the boat on\nthe understanding that the boat club\nwould have to \"repay\" it. Union\nFinance Committee is faced with a decision over whether or not to\nallocate money for a boat which has\nalready been bought.\nIt is true that the boat in question,\nthe eight used by Oxford when they\nwon the university boat race, was\nprobably excellent value for money,\nand that it had to be bought quickly\nor not at all. It is true also that the\nboat club has been exceptionally\nsuccessful, has received a lot of\ncoverage in the national press, and is\nan excellent advertisement for\nImperial College. This is why the club\ncan so readily call on the help of\nCollege admin.\nOne for the Road\nI have to say that I'm really rather\nashamed of this issue. So far this term\nwe have had one 16-page FELIX, one\n12-page FELIX with 12 pages of\nannual reports and four other 12-page\nissues. This time last year I was\nboldly planning to bring out a regular\n20 pages, and never fall below\nsixteen; 10 pages seems a little\npathetic. Hopefully the final issue will\nmake up for all the thin ones\u2014I intend\nto publish at least 36 pages, which\nwill include all the features we've\nbeen saving up until the end of the\nyear. I hope to have this out Friday\nJune 19th, though there is a possibility\nthat it will have to be delayed until\nWednesday June 24th. Try to hang\naround to see a copy; it should be\nworth reading.\nIf anyone would like a hand-bound\nedition of this year's FELIX, could\nthey please give me their name by\nnext Friday. A bound-edition will cost\n\u00a322.00, but they are well worth it,\nand it is the only way to make sure\nthat a full set of issues can be kept in\ntop class condition.\nCredits\nThanks, as usual, to Kamala Sen,\nJudith Hackney, Chris Martin, Pippa\nSalmon, Chris Edwards, Mark\nCottle, Dave Williams, Pete Wilson,\nDave Burns, Sundiatu Dixon-Fyle,\nSunny Bains, Francis Miers, Dave\nClements, Simon Bradshaw, Neil\nMotteram, Sarah Kirk, Andy\nBannister, Al Birch, Steve Shackell\nand Rose Atkins.\nA memory that lasts\na lifetime!\nShow your grandchildren what\nFELIX was like during your\nCollege days.

The\ncharge, which was reported in last\nweek's FELIX, has brought strong\ncomplaints from members of the\nCollege Trade Unions, prompting the\nLInion leaders to write in reply to the\nCollege Secretary, John Smith. Mr\nColley wishes to write a similar letter\nto Mr Smith.\nThe method by which the increase\nwas decided has also annoyed Mr\nColley, who maintains the Finance\nand Executive Committee did not\nmake a final decision but referred the\nmatter back to the Rector. Mr John\nChalmers, Senior Assistant Secretary,\ntook the minutes of the F and E meeting in question. He commented:\n\"It is my understanding that after the\nmeeting, the Rector and the College\nSecretary discussed how to implement\nthe measures\", adding that the\ndecision had already been taken at the\nmeeting.\nThe new system of charging staff\nand students for parking permits will\nbegin at the start of the next session.\nUS of Aid\nA group of American students raided\nSouthside Shop on Saturday, in a bid\nto help London's down and outs.

Descending on Southside\nShop they bought all the perishable\ngoods, which they distributed\namongst disadvantaged people on\nSaturday and Sunday evenings.\nRefectories Manager, Mr Rob\nNorthey, who runs Southside Shop,\nwas not surprised by the events. The\nAmericans spend about \u00a37000 worth\nof vouchers per month and sometimes\nup to \u00a3300 in one day if they are about\nto go home, he explained.

The\nletter published in The Independent on\nTuesday June 9th states that despite\nthe mildness of the Labour Party's Manifesto, a Labour Government\nwould remove American nuclear\nbases from Britain and leave Britain's forces without their own nuclear\npotential. It says that this will\nundermine NATO, reduce the\nprospects of multilateral armaments\nreductions and encourage the USA to\nbecome more isolationist. Ultimately,\nit claims, this would leave Britain\ndefenceless against Soviet nuclear\nblackmail. This, they feel, poses an\nunacceptable risk, increasing the\nlikelihood of a Third World War.\nAmongst the 102 names on the list are\nincluded several lecturers from\nOxford University and some London\ncolleges, but none from IC.\nThe open letter appeared five days after \"A Manifesto for Science\" was\npublished by The Guardian.

    "content": "Opinion A Human\nRights Dilemma\nWhilst one hears almost every day about\nJewish dissidents in Russia and blacks\nin South Africa, the Western media often\nignores one of the most serious human\nrights issues in the world today: the\nplight of the Palestinian people in the\nWest Bank (Palestinian territories\noccupied since 1967) and in the\nLebanon.\nOne wonders about the objectivity of\na \"free world\" which allows the State\nof Israel to get away with horrific crimes\nagainst the Palestinians. In 1982 50,000\npeople (most iy civilians) were killed and\nwounded in the invasion of Lebanon.\nIsrael claims that the almost daily\nbombardment of Palestinian refugee\ncamps in the Lebanon is an \"essential\nself-defence\" measure against \"terrorist\nbases\". The Israelis seem to think that\nthey have the right to deny the\nPalestinians the most basic of human\nrights: the right to a land of their own.\nThe report (1985) of a UN special\ncommittee (established in 1967\u2014UN\nresolution 2443) investigating Israeli\npractices in the West Bank, speaks of\n\"continuing deterioration in the level of\nrespect for the human rights of the\nPalestinian civilian population\".\nIn addition to restrictions on the rights\nof Palestinians to express themselves,\nmove about freely and form\nassociations, the Israeli government is\ncontinuing with its policy of annexation\nand settlement in the occupied\nterritories. The Israelis now have\nbuilding plans in the West Bank, which\nextend well into the next century.\nAccording to these plans, 27 new\nsettlements are to be built there by the\nyear 2010, at a cost of $650 million, on\nland which has been sie zed by force\nsince 1948from Arabs living in the area,\nfor so called \"security\" or \"state use\"\npurposes\nThe ruthlessness of the Israeli\npractices in the West Bank has made it\na regular event for universities to close\ndown for prolonged periods ('University\nof Beith-Lahem' and 'Beir-Zit\nUniversity' are still shut down); There\nare restrictions on the movements of\ncivilian leaders, such as lawyers,\nteachers and journalists; houses are\nsealed or demolished as a form of\npunishment. A Palestinian artist, Fauzi\nGhabin of Gaza, was jailed for six\nmonths, because he used the three\ncolours of the Palestinian flag in his\npaintings.\nThe most serious Israeli practice in the\nWest Bank is the overlooking of terrorist\nactivities by large scale organised settler\ngroups (such as the TNT gang), directed\nagainst the Palestinian civilians, and\naimed at driving large masses of Arabs\nliving in the area to flee their homes. In\nfact, only a few settlers, known to have\nparticipated in violent acts against Arabs\nin the West Bank, have been brought to\ntrial and in each case, the sentences\ngiven by the Israeli courts were a mockery. (Most of these convicted\nsettlers are allowed out of prison during\nthe day, and are only required to spend\nthe night in jail).\nDespite all the suffering of\nPalestinians caused by the Israelis, and\ndespite all the Israeli barbaric practices,\nthe Western media and many Western\ngovernments are still very keen on\npromoting the false Israeli image,\npicturing it as a democratic, \"peace\nloving\" country, often threatened by\nattacks from \"Arab terrorists\". The\nIsraeli propaganda is even beginning to\nsucceed, with Arabs always being\nlabelled as \"terrorists\" in the West,\nwhile most of the time it is they who are\nsuffering in the Middle East.\nThe sad truth is that there are four\nmillion Palestinians in the world today\nwho are homeless, a large number of\nwhom still live in refugee camps, often\nbeing butchered by various 'groups' and\nconstantly being persecuted by Israel.\nThis is not taking into account the West\nBank where there are one million or so\nArabs still struggling to live under Israeli\nmilitary rule. Yet, the West is doing]\nnothing to unmask the reality of the:\nIsraeli State and show the real terrorist\nin the Middle East.\nIn view of such indifference shown by\nthe Western world for Palestinian lives,\none has to wonder how much longer the\nPalestinians should suffer before the\n\"free world\" moves away from its;\nunjust attitude, and shows more!\nunderstanding and sympathy for the\nPalestinian cause.\nH Idriss, PG I When a director's first two major films\nare cult hits it can lead you to demand\ntoo much of his future efforts. So it was,\nI suspect, with Alex \"Repo Man\" Cox's new release Straight to Hell which opens\non June 12th. Straight to Hell is a spoof\non spaghetti westerns, in which Cox tries\nto combine the style of Sergio Leone\nwith a modern Spanish setting and a cast\nof itinerant rock stars. The problem is\nthat rock stars aren't necessarily great\nactors. This wouldn't matter in such an\noffbeat film if there were enough jokes\nto cover over the cracks\u2014unfortunately\nall that's left to prop up the plot towards\nthe end is a steadily increasing pile of\ncorpses. Joe Strummer as a 'hired gun'\nand Elvis Costello as a weird butler\naren't bad but the rest of the cast are just\nhamming it up completely.\nThis looks like a film which was fun\nto make, although it's only average to\nwatch\u2014and in this business average isn't enough. There are some good details\nwhich are reminiscent of the style of\nRepo Man but they aren't sufficient to\nmake up for the fact that it fails to be\nnearly as charismatic as The Good, the\nBad and the Ugly. It also lacks sufficient\ntalent for black humour to make up for\na high level of realistic violence\u2014I was\nsurprised that it got a15 certificate.\nPerhaps the censors rate sex and\nswearing worse than a bullet through the\nbrain?\nIf you like the Pogues you'll probably\nlike the way they play the treacherous\nMcMahone gang (a play on Pogue\nMahone?). On the whole though I get\nthe impression that this is just wacky old\nAlex Cox and some of his mates making\na wacky holiday film on a binge in\nSpain.\nDirk McBeast\nStraight to Hell\nPG Fish\nThe Annual General Meeting of the\nImperial College Union Postgraduate\nGroup will take place on Thursday June\n18th1987 at 1.00pm in the Union\nDining Hall. All Departmental\nPostgraduate Group bosses are required\nto attend; ie those of you who've had\nmoney from us over the year.

Also there is the\nceremonial pouring of the infamous\n'RCS mix' and painting of the\nExecutive. Clothes pegs definitely\nrequired for this one.\nTomorrow the RCSU Office actually\nmoves to its new site in Old Chemistry;\na process which will probably take\nalmost as long as we waited for the\noffice to be completed. Hopefully\neverything will be in good working\norder for next year. Please take the\nopportunity to visit the new office\nsometime.\nTomorrow night when the old office\nhas been cleared we will be having an\n' 'old office leaving party\".

Anyway, he gets the prize,\nwhen we've decided what it is. Thanks\nalso go to QTSoc for lending us the\nSanta suit. Nigel looked charming in it,\nand was most persuasive with a security\nguard from Covent Garden who tried to\nthrow us off, as well as promising lots\nof little children impossible things next\nChristmas, thereby causing six months\nof anguish for several mothers.\nWithout a large contingent from\nOpSoc, the singing would have been\natrocious (well, even worse, anyway) so\nwe're very grateful to them all.

Hammersmith was held by\nthe Labour candidate, and the results from Chelsea\nand Kensington are not expected until around\nmidday today.\nAt the time of going to press, with only about 50 results still\nto be declared, the Conservatives had won 347 seats, Labour\n225, the Alliance 14 and Others 6. Though these figures\nrepresent a small gain by the Labour party on the 1983 result,\nthe Conservatives have clearly won another landslide majority.\nThe Alliance did particularly poorly, after hopes of holding the\nbalance of power, and lost some of the seats which they had\nwon four years ago.\nThe local results are symptomatic of the general trend.\nLabour's Nick Raynsford will be particularly disappointed to\nlose Fulham to the Conservatives, having only recently won\nthe seat in last year's by-election. He polled only 15,430 votes,\nas compared to 21,752 for Carrington (Conservative). In\nWestminster South, the constituency which contains most of\nthe College Halls of residence, the Labour candidate polled only\nthree thousand less than the Conservative candidate, who won\nthe seat with just under twenty thousand votes.\nDrama occurred early in the day when FELIX photographer\nDavid Burns arrived at the polling station to cast his vote, only\nto be told that he had already voted. After protesting vehemently\nto the polling officials Mr Burns felt sufficiently incensed to\nrush over to the FELLX office to submit a late 'Small Ad'.

    "content": "Featura FELIX, Friday June12 th1987 ICy Heights\nIn view of the imminent departure of a group of IC students for\nthe Karakorum, FELIX introduces this week the gripping tale of\nthe first ascent of Annapurna in 1950.\nFor many people the idea of\nmountaineering in the Himalayas\nsuggests a long, lonely struggle up\nsteep rocks, in constant danger and\nhardship. But this is just a fraction of\nthe reality. Though in Himlayan\nexpeditions, as in so much else,\nfashions change\u2014from large groups\nwith hundreds of porters, to small\ngroups living off local food and with\na minimum of equipment\u2014the\ncomplexity of even the simplest is\nchallenging. Local people, porters,\nSherpas: all have to be dealt with\u2014\nin their own language. Climbing gear\nand enough food to sustain the people\non the mountain, with a wide safety\nmargin, have to be carried over great\ndistances of rough terrain. And then\nyou have to find your mountain...\nBy 1950, when Maurice Herzog's expedition started, 22 other\nexpeditions to the Himalayas had tried\nand failed in attempts to climb\nmountains of over 8000m. The\ngroup's objectives\u2014Dhaulagiri and\nAnnapurna\u2014lay in the heart of Nepal,\nan area as yet unexplored, so that the\nmaps of the area were sketchy, to say\nthe least. Thus after over two weeks'\nmarching across Nepal, the nine men\nfound their maps were wrong, and\nAnnapurna was nowhere to be found.\nRidges where passes were marked on\nthe map made the area\nun recognisable, and the few villagers\naround didn't recognise the name.\nAfter a period of recon na is ance the\nteam decided Dhaulagiri was too\nformidable, and the approach to\nAnnapurna was found. A route\navoiding likely avalanche paths, and\nthe treacherous crevasse d part of the\nNorth Annapurna glacier, was\nplanned on the first day the weather\nlifted enough for them to see the\nmountain clearly.\nNow it was a question of juggling\nsupplies between their earlier camp,\nthe Base Camp and the camps that\nwere to be established further up the\nmountain to support the assault\nparties. Acclimatisation would also be\na problem; earlier at 16,000 feet they\nhad suffered from severe headaches\nand even a form of hallucination.\nAlready the team found the plans for\nthe Alpine-style fast attempt they had\nmade in Paris were unworkable, and\nthey were glad of the Sherpas they\nhad intended to do without.\nAt last the order to start the assault\nwas given. From Camp I the route\nfollowed the glacier up. Sun reflected\noff the ice made the valley a furnace,\nthe thin air made breathing difficult\nand arguments broke out over the\nweight of the loads they carried. The\nusual daily storm, snow and mist\novertook them further up but finally\nCamp II was set up in the middle of\na plateau at 19,350 feet, with\navalanches roaring down from the\ninvisible heights around. The next\nstage was still more dangerous, all\nsnow and ice in unstable sera cs and\nslopes. Reconnaissance showed that\nthe only route was up a vertical ice\nwall, which they narrowly managed\nbefore the next snowfall. But that day\nthey were beaten back without finding\na place for Camp III. Fortunately\ngoing down was easier than climbing\nup, despite the difficulties of crossing\na heavily crevasse d area in the mist.\nAt this stage the rear guard of the\nexpedition\u2014including photographer,\ndoctor, and more food\u2014caught up\nwith the advance party, and the\nclimbers could feel that victory was\npossible. Eventually Camp III was set\nup in a snow packed crevasse. Camp\nIV followed qui cl dy, with the Sherpas\nrapidly picking up the necessary\ntechnique. Back at Camp II plans for\nthe next moves were made.\nThroughout the next day black specks\nmoved up and down between camps\nand a maze of tracks developed. But\ntowards evening the chaos settled\ndown.

    "content": "Opinion. FELIX, Friday June12 th19878 Sexual Apartheid\n\"I don't even think they know what a homosexual is. They probably think it's a pizza.\" Comedian Bernard Padden on his parents.\nAfter succumbing to pressure from\nAndy Bannister to prove that he's not\nthe only gay at IC, I thought I'd write\nan article on some of the daft things said\nby people in and out of College this\nterm. The above quote is quite suitable\nto describe the archaic prejudices and the\nsilly opinions of supposedly intelligent\npeople at the College.\nI'd like to answer a few of these\ncriticisms and include a few daft quotes\nfrom recent months to add a little lighthearted amusement.\nRecently we've all been flattened by\nthe excessive election coverage, yet\ndespite the fact that 10% of voters are\nassumed to be gay I did not hear any\npolitician address the gay question.\nAll we've heard is a torrent of\nhysterical rag bags splattered across the\ntabloids, ruining the careers of a string\nof mainly Tory MPs. Poor Harvey\nProcter, a misguided individual taken for\na ride by a group of certainly less than\ninnocent young men, is the most recent\nexample of this hysteria. Moreover in\nour supposed democracy gay\nrelationships are not legitimised for\nhousing, inheritance, taxation or\nimmigration and the discriminatory\nattitudes continue to squash visibility in\nbooks and magazines.\nFor gay men, sex itself is illegal\nexcept in a 'private, unshared residence\nwhen both are over 21 and neither first\napproached the other in a public place.''\nIn an electoral system where a swing\nof 3 % is regarded as crucial why have\nnone of the political parties expressed\npolicy on the gay issue?\nI think that the answer is that gay\nvoters apparently do not consider their\nhomosexuality to be a political issue.\nIndeed, Robin Squires MP believes that\nthe majority of gays presently vote Tory,\nso surely the Conservatives have got the\nmost to lose by adopting a clearly anti-gay stance. Yet despite a string of sexual\nscandals in the Tory party (of one kind\nor another), Tory MPs have never\nmoral is ed so much.\nIt is a damning indictment of society,\nparticularly here, that people know so\nlittle about what gays are like and are\nwilling to believe the most amazing\nexaggerated rubbish.\nThiS rV Mac J no and\" \\o;s frier vi sfl c\\>o cV< ar>c\\ MrS w rl kr se......f cloe Ur* fond of a dr.ok or31E Mark\nAIDS is probably the most grossly\nmis-represented issue affecting the\nimage of gay people today. AIDS does\nnot worry me\u2014I have no intention of\never being in a situation where catching\nthe virus is possible. It is true that the\ngay scene used to be rather promiscuous\nbut that is not the case now. Indeed,\n60% of men polled by Capital Gay had\nhad sex with either no one or only one\nperson in the previous month. Only 2 %,\non the other hand, claimed to have made\nit with between 11 and 20 partners.\nPromiscuity is now a term to be\nassociated with straights, especially the\nsex-starved people at Imperial. Most will\njump into bed with any woman given the\nchance! So in my view Mr Howgate and\nhis mates ought to concern themselves\nwith the AIDS issue and stop pawning\nit off on us as a term of abuse.\nSo what about the moral position? No,\nthis is not an extract from the ' 'Joy of\nGay Sex\", but an attempt to confront\nthe patronising view that to be gay is\nimmoral.\nHomosexuality is described by the\nchurch as \"sinful\", but so is adultery\nand that isn't illegal. There is a clinging,\nlabel of \"unnatural\"; a view that\nhomosexuality is a real threat to\nprocreation (though with overpopulation and the un availability of jobs\nthis might be seen as a bonus, were it\ntrue). But what is particularly annoying\nis the scurrilous accusation that gay men\nare dangerous to children.\nI think that much of society's subservience can be accredited to\nChristian teachings, most of it stemming\nfrom a positive dislike of women and a fear inherent in almost all clergy of their\nown latent homosexuality.\nThings are changing for the better,\nhowever. Brian O 'Sullivan, Executive\nSecretary of the National Conference of\nPriests said, \"I don't think any priest\nwould accept or encourage promiscuity,\nbut quite a lot would be prepared to\naccept a stable relationship of a homosexual couple.\"\nSo, what about sex? Almost every\nletter written in recent months has had\nreferences to sex. It is a paradox that\npeople who claim to be so disgusted at\nthe thought of people being gay, seem\nso interested in what it is we actually do.\nA few weeks ago someone wrote an\nappalling letter in which he used the\nword \"scatology\". Well that blok e was\nobviously thinking very hard about the\nprivate lives of gays to come up with a comment like that. There were other\nremarks like \"there's a lot of blood\naround\" attributed to Andy Bannister.\nIn fact he was severely misquoted and\nit amazes me that such a trivial comment\nraised so much hysteria. Suffice to say\nthe remark is completely false anyway\nif you're doing it right.\nFor the rest of you animals obsessed\nwith physical sex and penetration I suggest a useful reference\u2014 The Joy of\nGay Sex by Dr Charles Silverstein and\nEdmund White. Regrettably it's not\navailable in the College bookshop or the\nLyon Playfair Library, which is\nprobably just as well as I can see the riots\nnow.\nI don't want to say anything else about\nsex itself. It is after all a very private\nand personal issue and in my opinion it's not the business of anyone else. Besides,\nI don't feel we could give the subject a fair airing without verging on the\nobscene. I leave the subject with an\ninteresting exchange of comment\nbetween Peter Tatchell (ex left-wing\nLabour MP) and the manufacturers of\na strengthened American condom, Red\nStripe.\nTatchell\u2014\"I 've never had a condom\nsplit on me.\"\nRed Stripe\u2014\"You're either under-endowed or you don't thrust hard\nenough, love y.\" Make of that what you will!\nFinally, I want to pose this question\nto those of you who have read this far.\nWhat are you going to do if one of\nyour mates or perhaps your roommate\ntells you he's gay? Will you kick his face\nin, abuse him and force him back into\nthe underworld of lies and deceit he's been living in up 'till then or will you\nshake his hand and say \"well done for\nadmitting it! Now go out and do\nsomething to help sweep away the awful\nprejudices in the College\"?\nI don't expect straights to regard\ngayness as \"normal\" because it's not,\nby the very definition of the word. But\nI do expect intelligent people to accept\nthe need for gays to be able to come out\nat this college.\nI expect people to realise that\nhomosexuality is not a disease that you\ncan cure by hitting the people infected,\nbut a natural way of life for those of us\nborn gay. I leave you with these\nthoughts.\nAl Roberts (Doc I) Hr W kW> U<> people u/ loo cw eot Like\\o irv i.L \u00b0OK 'til Ut\nMr HacVio and MrS^ art Arte oo bU/it lot V^S one loa u^ a viola oo tUe T.
